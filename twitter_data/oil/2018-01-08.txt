40 2018-01-08 23:57:24 Ok great thanks! Currently it's so hot here in Australia that coconut oil stays in a liquid state, I understand why it it a winter treat! I'll see what I can do about cooling it down, thanks :). I'll try rolling it out, will let you know how I go!
41 2018-01-08 23:57:14 Years ago, we spoke about about oil palm fuel, so what happened? Soon our oil and gas will run out....electric cars, solar panels....ah yes, you can get a free deposit as a first time house buyer...what a joke....IF YOU GET A BANK LOAN! How dumb can Malaysians get?
42 2018-01-08 23:57:11 Yes! The skins natural oils play a very huge role in healthy looking skin, if not the largest role. I'm very cautious what I use when it comes to soaps. I am a fan of apricot scrub and coconut oil.

44 2018-01-08 23:57:10 Good thing you have a hot wife who brought some massage oil home 
45 2018-01-08 23:57:06 Beard growth

46 2018-01-08 23:56:52 Backache & other kinds of rheumatism
Mildly heat a small amount of black seed oil and then stroke the rheumatic area intensely. A teaspoon of oil should also be drunk three times daily
47 2018-01-08 23:56:37 I am so into that! I have those mint oil nasal inhaler doodads and love them, haha, these sound great! Especially since I’m hesitant to do oils throughout the house, with the cats breathing it, so personal sniffy tubes seem pretty great! Modern day perfume on a hanky. LOL

50 2018-01-08 23:56:13 @RLurieCTV I saw your piece on @ultramar not delivering heating oil to customers. Their excuse is BS. I had Ultramar and switched to Gaz Met 3 yrs ago because Ultramar was rationing heating oil during large cold snaps so they would not run out of oil before end of heating season

76 2018-01-08 23:53:18 @cathymcmorris @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins Yes, it's wonderful that Big Oil & Coal gets deregulated, we'll worsen air, water, have drilling in ANWR & off all lovely coasts of the US. More $$ for GOP donors, less protection for working ppl.
77 2018-01-08 23:53:10 Eye disease & impaired vision
Rub the eyelids and the sides of the eye orbits half an hour before going to bed with black seed oil. A tablespoon of the oil should also be drunk with a cup of carrot juice. Results should be apparent in one month, insha Allah.
78 2018-01-08 23:52:54 Alberta's conservatives spent several decades marketing it so they could hide the fact that the oil industry was taking the province to the cleaners.

82 2018-01-08 23:52:22 I do! I use coconut oil in a softened but solid state to cream with the sugar. It's a really great dough to work with - it doesn't seem to stick to anything. I haven't yet tried rolling it out, but it's on a mental to-do list...
83 2018-01-08 23:52:15 a thing i like to do when i have some time is to cut up meat (chicken/pork) in bite-size chunks, slap fish sauce & olive oil (+garlic if can be fucked) on it and let marinate for ~an afternoon. then u fry w some more oil and serve w rice/pasta
84 2018-01-08 23:52:11 I’ll pour you hot water and hot oil you’ll see
85 2018-01-08 23:52:01 Your regime is deregulating pesticides, allowing the sale of public lands to oil corporations, signing orders to allow pollution of waterways and supporting a coal industry that pollutes the air we breathe. How does all of that help farmers?

88 2018-01-08 23:51:51 Well, let's see. First the earth cooled. Then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil. And then the Arabs came and they bought Mercedes Benzes. And Prince Charles started wearing all of Lady Di's clothes. I couldn't believe it.
89 2018-01-08 23:51:39 Dry Cough
A teaspoon of black seed oil should be mixed in coffee and taken twice a day. Rub the chest and back with black seed oil.
90 2018-01-08 23:51:38 All you need is rice and a sock if you aren’t sewing inclined and aren’t worried about it being cute. Lol you can add an essential oil as well to your rice, I use about 3-4 tbs of lavender for mine. Then you just nuke it for 2-3 mins and apply to affected area.

99 2018-01-08 23:50:25 How do you know it’s not true?  The same things are documented in the ND oil fields.
100 2018-01-08 23:50:23 The wine & the oil is inseparable. God will not release fresh oil where there is no new wine. Ask God to make you new so that he can release a new salvific joy. Fresh oil flies on the wings of fresh salvation!! #rev.6:6 #mark 2:22 #anewyear #anewyou #crossingnations
101 2018-01-08 23:50:17 Isn't this what he said to steel workers who are still facing job loss. And he said it to coal miners while companies still move to gas, oil, solar, and wind. Now he's speaking to people who are losing to corporations he and his buds just gave more money to undercut with.

Whether it's food,clothes,oil,gas,cars,etc.,we all do each other some good &that's what some peeps fail to realize. We don't make or have everything in America, we need other countries too

115 2018-01-08 23:48:59 Good! We’ve got to stop the patronizing of these Middle-eastern countries. We have been raked over the coals for the last 40 Years with inflated oil prices. We are now energy independent! Thank God!

130 2018-01-08 23:46:29 Harper and every AB premier before Rachel Notley supported American and foreign ownership of our oil industry. Remember the outrage when PET tried to increase Canadian ownership back in the early 1980s?
131 2018-01-08 23:46:28 I dont have an actual cleanser so I use parts olive oil and parts dish detergent and tbh it’s decent. Not sure if it’s super gentle but it works until I can afford a cleanser
132 2018-01-08 23:46:20 Susan, they don't care about anything but money that will go to shareholders or that oil companies will move offshore. We've been played. Next they'll endorse an East West Highway and Trump supporters in Piscatiquis County/Northern ME will realize their mistake.

134 2018-01-08 23:46:06 I’ve been trying out this new conditioner that smells amazing BUT IT MAKES MY SCALP SO OILY EVEN AFTER I PUT ON DRY SHAMPOO SO I WILL NEVER LISTEN TO REFINERY 29. It’s partially my fault tho I should have seen that it mostly consist of coconut oil lol
135 2018-01-08 23:46:04 Remarkable! @AirCanada pls pay attention. Plus stop serving items that use palm oil. These are now common things to do.
136 2018-01-08 23:46:00 BLACK SEED==>For cancer treatment, mix one glass grape juice and half a teaspoon of Black Seed Oil. Drink three times a day. Treatment may last for forty days. In addition, you can also rub the black cumin oil on the affected cancer for two weeks.
137 2018-01-08 23:45:58 It would be cool to go to Dubai and see all the skyscrapers they made so much money off oil I guess.  Good ole petroleum makes the world go round!!!!
138 2018-01-08 23:45:53 I really don't want @Oprah to be a presidential candidate for two key reasons:

While obviously intelligent and successful, she has no experience in government.

She has promoted & sold bogus science and snake oil products over and over again.

We need experience and science.
139 2018-01-08 23:45:47 Yes, and one even encourages it.
140 2018-01-08 23:45:47 Stir together 4 1/2 tbsps chocolate with 4 tsps carne asada. Mix in Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve the next morning for breakfast.
141 2018-01-08 23:45:42 In dire need of oil down 
142 2018-01-08 23:45:22 Porn unrealistic as shit. How do these step moms keep getting stuck under tables and shit with the only way out being getting bent over by their step sons. Shorty bring a bottle of baby oil around or quit going under shit damn
143 2018-01-08 23:45:21 Amazing lightweight solo tent from @Hilleberg - was lucky with vouchers and a sale for this. Comfy sleep pad is essential. @Petzl zipka torch is long time fave (15yrs).  Eco toiletries for hair and clothes etc from @LushLtd. Tea tree oil.
144 2018-01-08 23:45:13 Now that I have established my opinion dominance - truffle oil sucks. There. I said it.
145 2018-01-08 23:45:13 ah flavoring the oil is a good idea. Also O.o how would garlic become... harder?!? Also also <.< a bit judging those who burn garlic
146 2018-01-08 23:44:59 it does but seriously as someone who suffers too, i've found hyaluronic acid helps so much, use that serum, and theres also a moisturizer from cerave and then top it all off after it's absorbed with a good body oil, rose is my preference because the smell is't too strong
147 2018-01-08 23:44:43 Can you help me change the oil to my car
148 2018-01-08 23:44:37 Cooking can be so poetic and beautiful, just now I was watching oil bubble across a pan and I thought “Wow, it kind of looks like my cellulite”
149 2018-01-08 23:44:32 Ioná - translate from Romanian. Romanian is spoken in Moldova...Most Moldovans speak Russian too - Ukraine speaks Russian more than Ukrainian - Crimea is Ukrainian but annexed by Russia for oil and military capabilities by Vladimir Putin. Ioná is Vladimir Putin confirmed!

When keeping on dum, add ghee mixed with hot rice water (Peech). Half cup, add lemon juice, oil (Saved from the fried onions). 3 table spoons each one. Theb keep on dumm.
153 2018-01-08 23:44:08 He is talking about "oil farmers" and "money farmers".
154 2018-01-08 23:43:49 Can't wait for my cbd oil to get here. My bottle is almost gone.
155 2018-01-08 23:43:42 No, Mr President! You are only fighting for oil.
156 2018-01-08 23:43:39 Netanyahus son just got busted on tape bragging about an illegal oil deal. Republicans are dead silent.
157 2018-01-08 23:43:29 So complicated!!! I was on so many sleeping meds that I built a tolerance to. Now, I'm off of everything, use a little cannabis oil at night and hope for the best. I really try not to obsess over it. Easier said than done.

161 2018-01-08 23:43:06 You mean a global warming "expert"?   Yeah right.  He wants his share just like the other snake oil salesmen.
162 2018-01-08 23:42:58 WHILE I DO AGREE W/ THE SELF CENTRED BS OF THIS STATEMENT i'm pretty sure what they're referring to is since it doesn't rain in socal on a regular basis, the oil/transmission fluid/etc from cars in traffic builds up in the asphalt so when it does rain enough, that oil wells up
163 2018-01-08 23:42:58 Just had to spend my Christmas gift card on an oil change and gas instead of new shoes. Wow I don't like adulting.
164 2018-01-08 23:42:57 Yes I saw that you are going to put up towers on Federal Lands. Nice going, more destruction of our national parks. Drill for oil, cut down trees, put up cell towers, let cattle owners kill wolves and graze their cattle on public lands.
165 2018-01-08 23:42:55 Talking specifically Thrive Algae oil.
166 2018-01-08 23:42:51 I need help/our farmers need2 stop growing so much corn/we can then stop the subsidies/corn is killing America/takes a tonne of corn to produce a small bottle of cooking oil/look up the process/you will shit/how about barley and hopps/better money than corn/Beer/what else 2 grow
167 2018-01-08 23:42:42 I made my own face scrub w coffee, sugar and coconut oil and y'all.

171 2018-01-08 23:42:20 Black cumin also has eight of the nine essential amino acids. Essential amino acids can not be synthesized in our bodies that need to be taken outside.
For nutritional supplement, you can take half a teaspoon of Black Seed oil or extract three times a day.
172 2018-01-08 23:41:59 can the oil be pumped out in case it doesnt explode or break apart and "just" sinks?
173 2018-01-08 23:41:54 I probably look like a legit wife buying lobster tails and truffle oil but my husband is actually making me dinner.  #blessed
174 2018-01-08 23:41:31 Add fats. Butter? Coconut oil?
175 2018-01-08 23:41:26 Instead of buying my wife essentials oil I bought her sequential oil because everyone else was buying it
176 2018-01-08 23:41:24 so true! I used to take my moms favorite musk oil and put it behind her ears and wrists and she always always smiled when I did this!
177 2018-01-08 23:41:20 Why resort to bathhouses when I have a perfectly good bath complete with aromatherapy and scented oil room at home~?
178 2018-01-08 23:41:18 It's a boring quickie meal 'cause I'm tired. Just baked chicken, garlic roasted potatoes, and spinach stir fried w/garlic, hot chili oil, & fish sauce.
179 2018-01-08 23:41:18 No worries :). Thank you! You said you use coconut oil instead of butter, do you use the oil in it's solid form to cream it? Or as a liquid?
180 2018-01-08 23:41:13 And your going to tell Texans that oil prices are in a bubble?
181 2018-01-08 23:41:09 So ms. boxer, you would prefer we obtain our gas & oil from foreign countries that HATE us an have vowed to annihilate the U.S.  Shows exactly where your loyalties lay.
182 2018-01-08 23:40:47 Esp red meats  also seafoods these will have fats no need to push extra fats just after the fast. Healthy fats are ghee olive oil coconut oil cocoa butter tallow lard macadamia avocado red palm make sure to get  DHA  and good to take Some DHA  during the fast too.
183 2018-01-08 23:40:43 That has nothing to do with it. Sickening that he is president. He has done nothing for this country,but take from the workers, banks, charities, taxes,insurance comps,students etc. He hires foreigners to work at Mar-A-Lago. He's smoke and mirrors, snake oil salesman,A FRAUD.
184 2018-01-08 23:40:24 Algae oil is considered more of an omega 9 or monounsaturated oil composition.

192 2018-01-08 23:39:31 When he came to office there are many unpaid subsidy arrears of 62bn for fertilizer and 48bn for oil marketers. If the gov can't pay those amount in early 2014 when oil price is high, then how can someone think of new subsidies in 2015.
193 2018-01-08 23:39:11 A 2016 study estimated that global fossil fuel subsidies were $5.3 trillion in 2015, which represents 6.5% of global GDP. According to the OECD, subsidies supporting fossil fuels, particularly coal and oil, represent greater threats to the environment than subsidies to renewables

206 2018-01-08 23:37:53 Sounds like a lot! Hope your body gets restarted! 

My parents use Hemp oil (from any Oz Health Food shop, but they buy Ozzie grown), it's very nutritious and has good ratio of Omega 6 & 9 which helps Omega 3 be absorbed. Their Dr's noticed all their bloods tests have improved.
207 2018-01-08 23:37:48 Bad night... got oil on my new hoodie, realized the dinner I was making needed to actually marinate overnight, cut my finger, and got bone in wings instead of boneless by accident... just realized the bachelor is on though and my night is so much better now.

216 2018-01-08 23:36:39 $nake oil salesmen & $he-devils...
217 2018-01-08 23:36:39 Agreed—more Suncors and Huskys are good for all Canadians! That said, we have the third largest oil reserve on a planet that hasn’t hit “peak oil” yet.  Thinking we can truly leverage it with only (our relatively small) Canadian companies is naive at best.
218 2018-01-08 23:36:31 Okay I was given beard oil but have no idea what it does
219 2018-01-08 23:36:29 Porque sera que para mi los personajes estrafalarios me parecen vendedores de "snake oil"?
220 2018-01-08 23:36:17 I’m loving using this wild growth oil. I’m seeing the results slowly but surely. 

What other products do you guys use that’s similar to wild growth oil?
221 2018-01-08 23:36:13 Y'all 
I'm sorry but I REALLY DON'T WANT your CBD oil, ITworks, Lula Roe, Rodan & Fields, Monat, etc.
222 2018-01-08 23:36:02 If they can drill people for oil they'd be passing a legislation for it now in US Congress #UnfetteredCapitalism
223 2018-01-08 23:35:48 Hit it with two different cooking temps. High temp to get rid of any excess fat, low temp to savor the flavor and get the insides perfect. A light brushing of olive oil on the skin does wonders too.
224 2018-01-08 23:35:25 Personally I can't think of any global order that has helped us over past 30 or 40 years.  Foreign interactions are things we seem to lose at.  Heck, we don't even need Persian Gulf oil any more.  We don't seem to be doing better on valued front - China, Egypt, Middle East etc

234 2018-01-08 23:33:47 You should be thanking me. A millennial investor waving the white flag here is the Gartman equivalent saying oil will never go above $44 in his lifetime.

259 2018-01-08 23:31:29 The Irish Cancer society blocked me for saying cannabis oil cures cancer. It seems so much money is pumped into cancer research and the one thing that is curing cancer these people don’t want to know about, I am one of hundreds that have been blocked. They are frauds!

272 2018-01-08 23:29:43 Yup the Oil prices go up and the jobs open up. It isn't rocket science, or politics for that matter.
273 2018-01-08 23:29:41 They want oil or coal, don't go.
274 2018-01-08 23:29:11 apparently ur not supposed to put coconut oil in ur eyes or mouth but i just used it as a cleanser and rubbed that shit in

280 2018-01-08 23:27:45 No, #LARain is not unique. It's a lousy excuse for lousy drivers. I'm from Chicago. I lived in L.A. for 10 years. Oil on dry pavement is NOT unique to L.A. The roads there are NOT "slipperier" than any other. Grow up.

290 2018-01-08 23:26:47 Lots of people discard garlic because during cooking it can become hard/bitter. But I’d add more to start so that the oil was properly flavored before I pulled it.
291 2018-01-08 23:26:47 I love when you talk with such power.. like just driving it home.. lighting my oil lamb in your honor.
292 2018-01-08 23:26:42 @SpeakerRyan . Mr. Speaker. I understand you like to go to the beach during the summer. I remember, a posted message you mentioned about it. But, know. I feel like the President going off topic. Excuse me. My point is. This Oil Rig Plan off all our coasts will be a disastrous
293 2018-01-08 23:26:37 USA wanted gas pipeline Qatar-Saudi Arabia - Syria - Turkey - Europe. Assad refused. 2 months after gas/oil pipeline Iran - Iraq - Syria was announced, Syrian "rebbels" started attaking security forces. There is not much more to it...
294 2018-01-08 23:26:32 Bill Clinton made U S federal budget look good in 1990's, but price was high, trade balance was lost, housing run into bubble, dollar was high, oil price exploded, finance misused the system, illusion was completed by 9/11 attack, chaos in the Middle East, ISIS, collapse of USD.
295 2018-01-08 23:26:30 My car keeps leaking oil and I don’t know if it’s actually leaking or Left over from when I Tried fixing it

297 2018-01-08 23:26:27 I’ve only seen clips online. I refuse to spend 90 minutes watching the equivalent of visual castor oil.

305 2018-01-08 23:25:42 Colonised, used, exploited! Where is the Scottish oil money gone? To Scotland? Look at Norway and ask yourself questions? Nowhere is perfect but Scotland has lost enough over the years and will even more next year with #Brexit and you know that very well!
306 2018-01-08 23:25:36 That's how it's going to be. We have enough oil already. Another few years every other car will be electric. We should be using off shore wind power. No pollution.

311 2018-01-08 23:24:18 Jason, do you follow @LukeGromen? IIRC, his premise is the Yuan doesn't need to replace USD, only to allow for oil purchases in FX other than USD. Once begun, it's a slow (or fast)  avalanche to USD devaluation.

316 2018-01-08 23:23:10 It's not likely to be the carrots. My guesses would be your olive oil or broth is off, there's too much ginger, or the old soap residue in the pot. I'd add salt and a fat, maybe some yogurt or milk?

321 2018-01-08 23:22:29 1. We don’t need oil money. We have enough already we just choose not to spend. 2. Oil money would have no bearing on the ‘prawn sandwich brigade’, as you call them. They already exist at all PL clubs, including Liverpool. That’s caused by ticket prices

330 2018-01-08 23:21:15 Maybe get some non-rx fish oil for your other dog. It's good for them anyway.
331 2018-01-08 23:21:13 ...  and that's with the *biggest oil and gas fields factored in at receipts from $113 a barrel oil.

337 2018-01-08 23:20:50 There's a massive strike today. Power cuts were due to an international oil crisis. What a facile, lazy critique of Corbyn.
338 2018-01-08 23:20:35 CNN:  That's huge. The Trump administration Thursday announced plans to roll back a ban on new offshore drilling off the coasts of Florida and California and is "considering more than 40 sites for leasing of natural gas and oil production."
339 2018-01-08 23:20:27 Please help to block the fuel oil/ gas powerplant, that isn't needed, from being built in the most pristine corner of your state.
340 2018-01-08 23:20:24 If only there was another way to pipe oil from one place to another

342 2018-01-08 23:19:51 maybe consider tillerson’s role in offshore drilling interests- putin loves oil
343 2018-01-08 23:19:50 How did this company, a personal favorite since I was little, mess things up so badly? I was a loyal “original recipe” lover; now it’s unaffordable and so greasy there are puddles of oil in the container!
344 2018-01-08 23:19:49 7 videos, 2 streams, an oil change and new glasses. Good day.

347 2018-01-08 23:19:31 I guess moving an Indiana high school game to Kentucky was a fairly dumb comment on my part. I'm guessing they could easily get 30,000 for Lucas Oil and depending which teams made it over 40,000.

354 2018-01-08 23:18:34 I know drenching your hair in coconut oil 2hrs prior is supposed to keep it from getting damaged in the process and there's other stuff to prevent damage while bleaching!!
355 2018-01-08 23:18:28 Oh yeah definitely.  Been using it myself for 20 years.  Keeps getting better and better.  They just introduced a newly formulated OE, XL and Signature Series motor oil.  Been around as you know since 72.
356 2018-01-08 23:18:22 Which Oil Spill would y’all prefer this Year ... we trying something 
357 2018-01-08 23:18:13 Nice! Fire up the oil!
358 2018-01-08 23:17:45 I've heard that song while waiting for my oil to get changed....I guess that's similar?!
359 2018-01-08 23:17:45 Nope. Not for oil. Because these women are standing up to Islamist pigs that fund global terrorism and treat ppl like dirt. Skin colour doesn’t matter, it’s what’s in the heart.
360 2018-01-08 23:17:38 But of course. My dog always eats the food with the Ultra Oil on it first.
361 2018-01-08 23:17:21 off shore drilling gave us the biggest oil spill in history from BP 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. We still have not recovered. We have short memories. Remember the junk shot?
362 2018-01-08 23:17:16 The oil/rain thing happens anywhere that has frequent dry spells. If there's already bad driving and inadequate infrastructure, yeah, it's gonna suck.
363 2018-01-08 23:17:13 My car just texted me that it's low on oil. 
364 2018-01-08 23:17:13 my current diet is high fat (lots of MCT coconut oil, almonds, etc) medium carb & vegan 
365 2018-01-08 23:17:03 I love those warnings on DVDs that the films aren't allowed to be shown on oil rigs. I like to imagine a Copyright Infringement SWAT team swooping over the North Sea in a helicopter to break up a screening of the Never-Ending Story.
366 2018-01-08 23:17:03 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
367 2018-01-08 23:16:59 It's raining in Las Vegas for the first time in about four months. The oil on the roads is making it like driving in snow.
368 2018-01-08 23:16:58 amazing! also the botanical oil! I've heard good thing about that too!

413 2018-01-08 23:10:48 I think you mean, are people still doing their own oil (changes)?  Absolutely.  I do my own and all the gearheads I know do.  For the DIFM (Do It For Me) people , you can find retail/install shops who sell Amsoil and oil changes.
414 2018-01-08 23:10:30 Oil/coal are going down quickly because of the disruptive change brought by electric/hybrid cars and the subsequent reduction in consumption of oil. Those will soon dominate the market as buyers all over the world force manufacturers to do so, and CHINA is leading this change.

417 2018-01-08 23:10:25 I hate when your beard itches and you can’t touch it because you have a gallon of beard oil in it. 
418 2018-01-08 23:10:18 how have I only just started using coconut oil
419 2018-01-08 23:10:16 Darling you don’t need to heat it to dry it and then oil it again if you aren’t about to use it. If you aren’t about to use it, you can just wipe it clean with kitchen roll. (@alexrclements and I both learnt from our respective fathers so our methods may vary).
420 2018-01-08 23:10:15 I add cut up chicken, spinach, carrots, sriracha, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and whatever other seasonings I want

422 2018-01-08 23:09:58 I get it people of California you’re not used to rain but that doesn’t mean you get to drive like a jackass! You’re too damn old to not know the roads are slick due to oil & other substances on these roads. Now I have to sit in traffic because people don’t understand this #LARain
423 2018-01-08 23:09:44 Bonjela just. Will get the oil. GRMA!
424 2018-01-08 23:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
425 2018-01-08 23:09:35 Ad he give y'all Anointing Oil saying it's gonna protect you 
426 2018-01-08 23:09:26 Oil: JPM expects US shale production to grow in 2018 if WTI >$60. But they'll be hard-pressed to secure enough frack crews on already tight labor, supply chain.

427 2018-01-08 23:09:25 put tea tree oil too close to my eyes and i think i’m going blind x
428 2018-01-08 23:09:18 I pray Michael Moore will put an oil drilling rig right off Mar-a-lago, maybe we could do a go-fund me so all of us American's who are sick of the oil industry destroying the earth can take revenge!
429 2018-01-08 23:09:10 At the doc's with Shelby Jo. Shes getting her ears an oil change. :o

431 2018-01-08 23:08:50 Can you please tell us who these small businesses are? Since taxes for any company with a profit of less the $250.000 went down, or in your bubble do you call those people earning over that a small business. Let me guess they all own Tim Horton's or oil companies? #canpoli
432 2018-01-08 23:08:44 Try wild hair growth oil. My edges finally growing back and my hair is growing. I’ve been using it about 3 weeks now
433 2018-01-08 23:08:40 Not really, since his ass kissing of the oil and coal industry will poison the land those farms rely on.
434 2018-01-08 23:08:33 Hey. The coal miners can go to Iowa and work on a farm snake oil

436 2018-01-08 23:08:29 Si planteamos un objetivo de oil para fin de año de U$S70/80, suba d productividad, mejores balances, mejora de ratios de deuda, suba d precios internos de combustibles el papel tiene que andar bien! El sector viene muy rezagado y creo q puede verse una mejora sustancial en 2018
437 2018-01-08 23:08:16 สำหรับเราเราว่าBuyBuy oil คุมมันดีกว่าค่ะ
438 2018-01-08 23:08:16 The guys who change the oil in your car stay condescending
439 2018-01-08 23:08:10 That is true. In this case however it involves a lot more than land. It involves money. It involves the price and availability of oil.
440 2018-01-08 23:08:07 These shell companies are used by people living here.
I've found directors with controlling interests in Oil co's registering using BVI.
Yes, it's a legal loophole.
Who controls those laws?
ScotGov?
(Nope)
441 2018-01-08 23:08:04 Also don't forget all the snake oil salesman Oprah has promoted over the years.  Do you really want Dr. Oz as HHS Secretary?
442 2018-01-08 23:07:45 -no but as a proxy for #PuertoRico´s economy one could look at #Venezuela (after subtracting oil reserves) same corruption + disregard for property rights & they have a similar % of public sector workers compared to their total workforce.

444 2018-01-08 23:07:21 I hateeee getting my oil changed. It always takes forever 
445 2018-01-08 23:07:14 We do not respond to bullying. Surprised? He doesn’t understand what the talks are about; grain, oil, dairy, auto parts etc. No one gave us options when he said he didn’t like NAFTA.
446 2018-01-08 23:07:14 Cornstarch on white socks, baby oil around the eyes/nose before you show for that subtle ~glow~ but NOT if it’s super hot/sunny, rubbing alcohol to remove sweat, spray a wet horse with alcohol and it will dry faster
447 2018-01-08 23:07:09 If you put vegetable oil on the soles of your running shoes you can actually drift around corners when you're running

449 2018-01-08 23:06:51 Im 70. How do u young ppl feel about subsidizi ng ( putting money into) coal n oil?
450 2018-01-08 23:06:45 I just worked on tree cars in a row with no oil in them. Am I the only one who finds that incredibly stupid or am I just too picky
451 2018-01-08 23:06:43 taking my car to get an oil change today was the most stressful experience of my life thus far
452 2018-01-08 23:06:41 Empty oil tank. Uh oh.
453 2018-01-08 23:06:22 And they are trading the oil in dollars!!
454 2018-01-08 23:06:18 How do you keep a straight face when you're working to poison the land (you know, the land that those farmers need to FARM?) by catering to oil barons and coal mine owners?
455 2018-01-08 23:06:13 Water, Coconut oil and shea butter are major keys 
456 2018-01-08 23:06:10 Russia will be selling their crude oil in yuan soon, the eu realises this, and the eu is putting across strength and power for a stronger relationship over the coming year as the dollar slides due to petrodollar without russia.

459 2018-01-08 23:05:37 I drain three cans, in a baking dish, drizzle with some oil. Sprinkle with garlic powder and cayenne, s&p. Stir and bake at 375 for about 30 minutes. Simple, easy and way healthier than bread or pasta.
460 2018-01-08 23:05:26 جزاك الله خير ...
461 2018-01-08 23:05:26 Can't believe I prefer tea tree oil to most people

465 2018-01-08 23:04:25 That the focus on drilling in an era of drawing down of gas powered vehicles is amusing. Oil is going away.

471 2018-01-08 23:04:00 What about the fishing industries off the coasts? Your allowing oil companies to drill anywhere off the coast and that's going to ruin the environment and their businesses.
472 2018-01-08 23:03:50 I have a sort of bulletproof coffee. I put coconut oil in it!
473 2018-01-08 23:03:36 The first rule of olive oil by subscription?
474 2018-01-08 23:03:24 Crude oil was below $20/barrel when Klein came to power. Our infrastructure spending was higher than the Canadian average.
475 2018-01-08 23:03:01 So I went to get the oil changed in my car on Saturday and when it was done the guy handed me my keys and saw the Harry Potter keychain on it and looked at me and said “oh you’re one of those people”
476 2018-01-08 23:02:59 when i was in primary school and i read such magazines, they predicted that in 2000 there will be no oil, gas and coal on earth and we would be all dead :)

480 2018-01-08 23:02:38 My advice for 2018: drink your water, take your vitamins, put on your coconut oil, hit your workout routines and don't worry about what anyone says about you. They just jealous.

491 2018-01-08 23:01:51 It is incredible the damage oil industry can do almost without any liability, because even if they are fined the damages they cause take generations to be cleaned. We do not need any more oil, we need clean renewable energy resources!
492 2018-01-08 23:01:32 I have coffee, rain, my cat and a new essential oil diffuser. Not a bad Monday 
493 2018-01-08 23:01:30 Also, Putin and China are starting to sell oil in Yuan’s, bet you don’t even know the economic implications of that. Putin sure picked the right dotard to make Russia great again

556 2018-01-08 22:55:44 As of 2016, New York would rank at #11.  The only red state exception is Texas, which is our 2nd largest economy, and ranks as the world's 10th.  But that's because of the oil and gas industry.  But Texas does not give as much to the fed as CA, NY, or IL.

562 2018-01-08 22:54:49 @nailogical I just watched your video on how to grow out your nails and was wondering if i could mix aloe gel with jojoba oil to get a similar affect to the vitamin e gel. i aspire to have your nail and love your videos! i've also gotten my sisters into watching them.
563 2018-01-08 22:54:46 I think shea butter and coconut oil are a magical concoction 
564 2018-01-08 22:54:38 But... where does the oil go? Where does the pan live when it’s oily? Is it supposed to change colour? I don’t need to oil the handle right? 
565 2018-01-08 22:54:32 ยังไม่ได้นอนเลย นอนไม่หลับ ปวดท้องมากก รอพ่อตื่นแล้วจะไปโรงพยาบาล ปวดจนมือสั่นไปหมดแล้ว !!
566 2018-01-08 22:54:26 My mom is so shooked by all the bath and body works, cocoa butter, baby oil, coconut oil and vasaline I have ”you taking all that w you” yeaaaa guh
567 2018-01-08 22:54:20 I am asking your help? Would you allow me to put 1 post about our CBD oil on your timeline to make people aware?
568 2018-01-08 22:54:00 oil ocean man, take me by the oil hand
569 2018-01-08 22:53:31 I hope your cabbage is delicious. I just made some - stir fried in sesame oil - yesterday!
570 2018-01-08 22:53:30 Thanks for the tip! I was trying to figure out what type of oil to pair it with.
571 2018-01-08 22:53:23 それは残像だ
572 2018-01-08 22:53:08 What part of compassion are you lacking? That’s the part of of the conversation I don’t understand. You are literally wanting people to be sent to a place they no longer know, poverty or worse (death).
573 2018-01-08 22:53:03 Neither, it's patchouli oil.
574 2018-01-08 22:52:49 I just pour in enough oil to get an egg and heat up the pan until it's so hot the oil starts to steam then I turn it off and leave it to cool. Then it's done.
575 2018-01-08 22:52:39 Chapped lips? 
Need help microwaving chocolate?
Have dry skin?
Run out of butter when making cookies?
Crazy hair?

The answer is always coconut oil.
576 2018-01-08 22:52:32 our first time with propane or oil heat. The air is definitely warmer, but our heat and electric bills are both wicked high, and I suffer all winter with head congestion from the dry heat. Granted we are living in a house built in 1785, but we can't afford the work needed.
577 2018-01-08 22:52:26 ‘ Blasted ecological hellspout of Nortern Alberta ‘ ????? Do some research dipstick. Oil sands regs require miners to leave surface as it was before production. Sheesh.

579 2018-01-08 22:51:47 You don't want it to catch on fire. Or stay wet. The oil should absorb into the pan. Don't fret, you'll get the hang of it.
580 2018-01-08 22:51:18 Question is it extra virgin olive oil or just plain Ol Olive oil!!!! 
581 2018-01-08 22:51:10 And re-think its Oil and Whisky imports.
582 2018-01-08 22:51:05 @joerogan Heeeeey Joe, do ya think you can point me in the right direction for the best CBD Oil? Thanks in advance is ya get to me!! 
583 2018-01-08 22:50:30 i self identify as mayo w olive oil
584 2018-01-08 22:49:59 I have the same problem with capiralism's use of the military to secure resources like oil.
585 2018-01-08 22:49:50 Actually its okay to get some in your eyes! some ppl use castor oil as a eye lubricant but i mean it makes my vision so blurry
586 2018-01-08 22:49:22 Still not blocked in she who shall not be named's chat. LOL! I didn't know CBD oil could make you "act" like that!
587 2018-01-08 22:49:01 TBF this sounds way more interesting than me getting an oil change in the OC
588 2018-01-08 22:49:01 油を英訳するとオイル、オイルを和訳すると油。友達です。  @ABURA_elf
589 2018-01-08 22:48:48 Admon- if one claims another owes barrels of oil, and one admits owing just the barrels, considered partial claim and can bee forced to swear.
590 2018-01-08 22:48:45 That's always preferable, but not always possible given economic conditions.

A sub $50 barrel doesn't do Alberta any favours on long term capital investments, foreign or domestic. Our oil sands are just too expensive at times.
591 2018-01-08 22:48:33 I'm sure she's cut wine, smoothies, proper coffee, butter, olive oil, and fresh fruit & vegetables from her diet.
592 2018-01-08 22:48:19 Hey Pinnochio, I hope they build the first oil rig off Mara-A-Lago. And of course they will eventually have an oil leak-- they always do. You will go down in history as the the Pres who ruined the environment.
593 2018-01-08 22:48:12 my dream job would probably be smoking weed, listening to the Doors and doing hyperalistic surreal oil paintings
594 2018-01-08 22:48:09 "All of your tires are bald, you had no oil left, and your car is so out of alignment. It's really bad."

Some guys car diagnosis at Firestone right now.
595 2018-01-08 22:48:04 Do you take a fish oil supp?
596 2018-01-08 22:47:42 What if (and here's a concept) alaska taxed the oil companies more to reduce the state deficit instead of taking money away from Alaskans PFD?
597 2018-01-08 22:47:35 Olives that have known no pressure
No oil can bestow
598 2018-01-08 22:47:20 Now we're thinking...but do I have sesame oil? My pantry is slowly being stocked. Very slowly.
599 2018-01-08 22:47:02 My lil bih so spoiled. I rub her down with oil.
600 2018-01-08 22:47:02 Oh wow olive oil rosemary sounds lovely, shame they closed!
601 2018-01-08 22:46:32 And the sun shines and wind blew and the oil captains grumbled into their rum (unless the #coal lobby runs wild and grows the grid supply for all the #EV). #India #2030 #globalgoals #ESG #climate
602 2018-01-08 22:46:31 US is the top buyer of Venezuela oil. We should stop buying oil from them to accelerate de collapse of this dictatorship. That would not penalize the people cause there is already a major shortage of everything, from basic food to toillet paper. The sooner Maduro goes the better.
603 2018-01-08 22:46:17 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
604 2018-01-08 22:46:06 Im sick of people like you thinking all Scotland is good for is producing oil. You are forgetting other things like tourism as 1 example. I remember #indyref and the #SNP repeating.. its NOT all about oil, which has raised to $68 a barrel
605 2018-01-08 22:46:03 Truth and righteousness comes from the Lord. I think the oil is the work of the Holy Spirit, and these run out of oil because they somehow blaspheme the Holy Spirit (Mt 12:31, Hb 6:4-6).
606 2018-01-08 22:45:47 stir fry with hot sesame oil
607 2018-01-08 22:45:21 I heard using hot water dries it out more. Definitely gonna cut my shampoo usage and try some hot oil! Thank you!!
608 2018-01-08 22:45:21 Thankfully, the car was just low on oil.
609 2018-01-08 22:45:08 maybe they managed to save the child with some non-electricity electrocution, but using olive oil as an alternative source of energy. sometimes electrocution is why he/she got diseased.
610 2018-01-08 22:45:02 Y'all better get this coin that's about come out!
Each coin is worth a single barrel of oil!

611 2018-01-08 22:45:02 To sop up oil & refresh makeup, lightly mist your face with toner, then pat with a tissue, Finish with a dusting of loose powder. #beautytip
612 2018-01-08 22:44:58 Avocados and coconut oil makes life just the tiniest bit better.
613 2018-01-08 22:44:50 Yes, 24 yrs old Somali born Canadian National, a student at the University of Calgary hired Lawyers and kicked out 4 western oil companies Kenya signed with Oil Exploration: Eni (Former Agib) blocks L21, L23, and L24, Total of France block L122, Norway’s Statoil & 1 US Company.
614 2018-01-08 22:44:29 try Too Faced foundation called “Born this way”, contains coconut oil! I’ve swapped to that and it’s the best I’ve used!!
615 2018-01-08 22:44:15 So finally one isn't safe from both male and female anymore... 

Destiny boosters & oil kitty's 

Not that am surprised
616 2018-01-08 22:44:12 But you can fry the kale in coconut oil, season it lovingly with rosemary and basil then delicately put it in the bin. Voila ... order pizza burger.
617 2018-01-08 22:44:03 oil on canvas: "Spinning and breathing within the floor of the midbrain that affects the axonal projections" (Another Crap Art TM 1989)
618 2018-01-08 22:44:03 YES. There are plenty of people here in my district whose families have been in gas and oil for generations... but even they don't like how we're being treated by these big companies. It's disrespectful and it devalues our properties. And they certaonly don't want #forcedpooling.
619 2018-01-08 22:43:50 it feels so weird and grossly intimate to draw other people's art and this is why i will never grow as an artist RIP i wish i could just do oil portraits forever and ever
620 2018-01-08 22:43:46 oil on canvas: "Unknown quantities of light can be projected to very different parts of the brain" (Another Crap Art TM 1987)
621 2018-01-08 22:43:44 Oil Block Renewal, we are not human beings in Nigeria and we are holding all Africans around the world down.
622 2018-01-08 22:43:40 Her promotion of the Satanic Ritual Abuse panic was not "harmless." People went to jail. You'd have to look hard to find some snake oil hawker, loony New Age nutcase, anti-vax wanker or miracle-cure hoaxer that she has not championed.
623 2018-01-08 22:43:36 Hey Essential Oil ladies of Twitter, I just got the oil in my car changed, am I a business owner now?

626 2018-01-08 22:43:24 getting my oil changed for the first time in like 6 months i love personal growth
627 2018-01-08 22:43:15 You should know that not everyone down here is happy that he’s the president. A lot of us know a snake oil salesman when we see... and hear... one. #TrumpTN
628 2018-01-08 22:43:15 Sauté with oil, salt, pepper, a little bit of butter, and if you really want flavor add some garlic 
629 2018-01-08 22:43:11 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
630 2018-01-08 22:43:02 Oil delivery is tomorrow and our oil tank is just below 1/8. Never been this shook.
631 2018-01-08 22:42:59 @wheelerdealers  for gods sake creamy deposits on the oil cap are MOT a sign of head gasket failure get a grip #wheelerdealers
632 2018-01-08 22:42:48 However I see from the quick look-up that Italy and Germany have a lot of palm oil burning as biofuel for electricity generation a road we have not yet gone down though some companies are proposing to build generators to use it.
633 2018-01-08 22:42:40 Nah I’ve got a stash here already. Multisymptoms, Advil, extra strength Panadols, shilling oil, Vick’s, Buckley’s you name it an entire cosmetic bag of the good real medication. Not the children stuff the have here
634 2018-01-08 22:42:36 Don’t let Ryan zinki see that he will want to put oil wells there
635 2018-01-08 22:42:26 He was a prolific fella in the early 80s...........  burning gallons of the midnight oil..!
636 2018-01-08 22:42:24 The Triumvirate is running the show. Mattis, McMaster, Kelly. Trundle out Trump for his big assed signature when needed. They have, NATO, GWOT covered with a touch of East Asia. Zinke, DeVos, Pruitt, Perry just winging it. Zinke offshore oil leases case in point.
637 2018-01-08 22:41:58 I thought we were discussing that “clean energy doesn’t need oil to exist.”
Actually “clean energy” doesn’t exist at all. All sources have their issues. Have you seen the mining / manufacturing operations for wind turbines/ solar panels?
638 2018-01-08 22:41:57 Mom dropped me and bre off at target to go get her oil changed, then decided to buy a new car and the service guy forgot to come get us but now we chillen in the kids center at Straub’s
639 2018-01-08 22:41:29 How much is too much oil? I didn’t know there was so much involved I just wanted a frying pan I could put in the oven 
640 2018-01-08 22:41:22 Lots of parity in NHL.  Oil come back next yr with backup, a PK, new determination, small roster tweak.. night and day result
641 2018-01-08 22:41:14 We have cheap solar power for desalination and cheap solar power to pump water inland to our deserts and arid areas.  If we can build pipelines for oil why not aqueducts. Green landscapes cool and suck up CO2.  Food and fibre result creating jobs and new land for climate refugees
642 2018-01-08 22:41:03 "Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness abov..." ~Psalms 45:7
643 2018-01-08 22:41:02 These girls will leak your oil. 
644 2018-01-08 22:40:57 Our IG should also play smart too, if Nigeria can help us regain our Independence, they can take part of the oil in Bakassi for 20yrs.
645 2018-01-08 22:40:47 Gritty is good for my tastes. I like a lot of flavour but not too oily. Make sure there's not too much oil on the bottom for sure.

647 2018-01-08 22:40:36 Nobody, and I mean nobody, is going to dictate what kind of oil I fry my cheap processed food in.
648 2018-01-08 22:40:31 Correct, and petrol, oil, plus so much other products.

651 2018-01-08 22:40:12 I’m currently in the Honda “quiet waiting room” getting an oil change and there’s an older couple in here and the lady asks “sorry honey do you mind if I play some Christian music” This is actually really needed and I might start crying infront of these strangers.

654 2018-01-08 22:40:00 @realDonaldTrump I know those needed WiFi, I drive with Uber now, and we need upgrade GPS! Within 300 ft isn’t professional! Still going to drill oil/gas in Red Rock-OK? Refuse to read garbage. Always
655 2018-01-08 22:39:41 I think you only have to look at the map of the last POTUS election to see we're not a "melting pot", more like oil & water, and getting worse everyday.
656 2018-01-08 22:39:39 So to avoid having to buy oil, we should build pipelines through Native American land?  What about their sovereignty? How about we put a couple through your neighborhood? You realize the hazards that are involved with building pipelines near residential areas?
657 2018-01-08 22:39:30 Same!! It holds up better than ground beef anyway and way less oil
658 2018-01-08 22:39:29 i use rose oil at night it, controls your facial oils
659 2018-01-08 22:39:23 I oiled it with coconut oil & baked it, then left it to cool. Washed it, heated it to dry it, then coated with a bit of veg oil. Is it supposed to feel so oily and dirty to the touch??
660 2018-01-08 22:39:18 Then we should inverts in new technologies and new forms of renewable energy, it will generate millions and generate employment and the dependence on fossil fuels and the money we save not buying oil from the terrorist regime of Saudi Arabia
661 2018-01-08 22:39:18 A monstrous oil tanker.
It's wound bleeding in seas.
662 2018-01-08 22:38:59 I swear those don't look like clouds, more like oil floation in a bad mix with water. crazy
663 2018-01-08 22:38:53 lol u must be gettin an oil change like every other month
664 2018-01-08 22:38:48 Sean@ Oil knight wrote an incredible piece. Everything he said is exactly what I believe and how I feel about the team. Fans are divided unfortunately
665 2018-01-08 22:38:41 I just need something to blow steam at a sick dog. I don't need a fancy essential oil diffuser with a fifty dollar price tag. I don't even want the medicine. I just want the humidifier. That's all. #argh #onlineshopping
666 2018-01-08 22:38:39 Taking cannabis oil, but even double dosing isn't taking the edge off. Looks like another long night ahead.
667 2018-01-08 22:38:29 @VickiMarble ethics hearing: Cain of Extraction says he paid CB & Potts bill ($1,121) from 2/15 event with corporate card from Hill & Knowlton, where he worked on 2/15, and expensed it back to Extraction Oil & Gas. #coleg @colo_politics #copolitics
668 2018-01-08 22:38:23 Was it really PC who was all ga ga over Reinhart before the oilers gave up the draft picks for him or was it actually MacT who was pushing for the trade as the oilers obviously watched him w the oil kings
669 2018-01-08 22:38:17 Ayurvedic book-  put one drop of neem oil in each nostril. Avoid light, noise.

671 2018-01-08 22:37:51 i think i may have fucked my shin up, i crashed my bike but it was bad luck my back tire lost traction on some oil on quarry road, i crashed going UP hill thats depressing for me haha
672 2018-01-08 22:37:48 The combination of poor trades w/ nothing coming from the pipeline certainly hampers things. They have to draft & develop in order to.get out of this.
673 2018-01-08 22:37:46 Ridiculous snake oil salesman 
674 2018-01-08 22:37:45 the age doesn't matter. how much oil does it hold? and what kind of oil filter is in it?
675 2018-01-08 22:37:39 She’s also sold snake oil and pseudoscience through her brand and popularity. “Dr.” Phil and Oz Mehmet, M.D. both exist as cultural forces because of her to our detriment. This is no billionaire with clean hands.
676 2018-01-08 22:37:38 @lisamurkowski  Enjoy your beautiful state while you can cause Lisa just got her wish to open ANWR and all coastal drilling just so she could pay back her donors. Pictures of oil and gas sites should be just as beautiful.....
677 2018-01-08 22:37:34 You’re very welcome x I love them and they are so easy. My waffle iron is a bit old now so I have to spray some coconut oil on to stop them sticking but they are certainly a staple for me x
678 2018-01-08 22:37:32 Did you know how patchouli oil distilled? More traditional than cedar Wood
679 2018-01-08 22:37:28 Schiff is creepy. He is covered in oil n slithers like a snake.
680 2018-01-08 22:37:23 How arrogant are these EU scumbags ?
Impose sanctions on others then run crying to World Gov court when sanctions are applied to them .
Russia should ban oil/gas exports to EU and develop new markets in Asia .
Destroying #EU is an imperative
681 2018-01-08 22:37:21 @realDonaldTrump  tine for  all ships to have gps collision avoidance ! oil tankers colliding ??? in 2018 ???  it must be stopped !!

685 2018-01-08 22:37:06 Hey @lisamurkowski I'm a little confused how you admit climate change is real and threat to Alaskans especially those in communities who rely on fishing in the ubiquitous acidic ocean, yet you stride for drilling oil in those same oceans?
686 2018-01-08 22:37:00 When EV1 in life screws up, gotta pay Price-Fine, jail, Prison. Oil Co.-Spills 100,000 barrels, gets fined $100,000.They make 100 Bill $. Kill wildlife, pollute water, and N/responsible for Clean up.Who suffers - Every1 except, oil Co.Drilling. Screw Ppl at Pump.Their N/Paying
687 2018-01-08 22:36:58 Please make sure you do because between the unnecessary unrecyclable packaging and the amount of foods containing palm oil your starting to look like a very environmentally damaging company
688 2018-01-08 22:36:33 not from XLE but natural gas has been good in both directions. I’m waiting for oil to pull back
689 2018-01-08 22:36:21 What about the families that count on their livelihoods from the oil industry Susan?  I guess you do not care for those families.  HAVE YOU NOT NOTICED THE ECONOMY?  With people like you in charge...well that is where we get the Obama new normal of 1%.  GO TRUMP!
690 2018-01-08 22:36:03 Like most jobs you surround yourself with the most talented people. Oil have not done that
691 2018-01-08 22:35:53 Glossier's priming moisturizer and Milk Makeup's sunshine oil!
692 2018-01-08 22:35:50 How did the NDP scare away our industry? Hubby's in his 50s too, finally got a full time job after 3 YEARS trying. Oil is picking up again.
693 2018-01-08 22:35:49 Ok it started off due to swine fever,  then went sanctions retaliation,  EU now pushing its luck might have Russia turning off the oil and gas taps to Europe in the depths of winter.  These EU types aren't very bright are they?
694 2018-01-08 22:35:48 It’s nothing like washing your hair and putting peppermint oil on your scalp after 
695 2018-01-08 22:35:45 A little peanut oil and I can take care of that for them.
696 2018-01-08 22:35:43 My forehead shine automatically . I don't have to put no lotion or oil on it it'll still shine .
697 2018-01-08 22:35:36 I just remembered my mum used to put warm olive oil in my ear and make me lie on the floor for 10 mins. Wanna try that in the morning in the office?
698 2018-01-08 22:35:36 first night testing my new oil by The Ordinary. Pls don’t break me out or something pls pls.
699 2018-01-08 22:35:31 Are you telling people how they get free top ups of oil between services because your cars have known issues with oil.  Or this something you wait to inform them until they read the manual or when the engine runs dry after 5-7 months
700 2018-01-08 22:35:12 Why y’all be asking social media who do breaks, oil changes, and anything else dealing with your raggedy ass car instead of finding a mechanic ?
701 2018-01-08 22:35:08 RT @LivingSafely: #Kraft Italian Dressing this January? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
702 2018-01-08 22:35:03 Kate blocked me last week from her page and deleted my comment when I asked her why did she delete Vera Twomeys comment about her curing her daughter with cannabis oil. She blocked Paul Barry also and many other people that said the same. This is not freedom of speech. Shame on
703 2018-01-08 22:34:57 Never soak it in water! Before using for first time coat it in oil and bake at 350f for 30 min. Keep oiling and baking after use. Not that hard once you get the hang of it. I love mine!
704 2018-01-08 22:34:47 I need some of your essential oil spray is what I really need
705 2018-01-08 22:34:46 If #oil / #petroleum is so great (it is an amazing source of pure energy, indeed), then why do we need to #subsidize it?
706 2018-01-08 22:34:46 And? That makes it not cruel?

Super interesting to look at though, better than a wall of white paint any day."
714 2018-01-08 22:33:51 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it

726 2018-01-08 22:31:33 I went and got my oil changed Saturday and had a long chat with a pastor sitting there about our lives (what else do you do? Idk I’m awkward) and this 80 year old man described his Subaru hatchback as a “GOAT” to me. How is he more cool?
727 2018-01-08 22:31:25 We wore Jesus sandals. Leather soled flip-flops with a ties ring design. You had to soak them in water to rid the excess oil & prevent warts
728 2018-01-08 22:31:19 Don't waste your time applying decking oil.
Basically turps with some oils that evaporate & need re doing every 6mths to keep in good Nick.
729 2018-01-08 22:30:53 What companies R using palm oil/exploiting palm oil+list them. Stop buying their products+mass-campaign them to quit palm oul production.
730 2018-01-08 22:30:51 @SenatorCollins -- you have got SOME nerve.  When you betrayed us by voting yes for the #TaxScamBill, you approved of drilling. Now you want to have Maine treated special, no drilling by your beautiful Maine, while the rest of the country is pillaged for oil. You are shameless.
731 2018-01-08 22:30:51 @Steven_K_Bannon is a traitor and needs to change the oil in his hair #stablegenius #SloppySteve hahaha

754 2018-01-08 22:27:15 amen! GW Bush even managed to straddle both by being a "celebrity sports team owner" (though he was horrible) + oil baron. His whole campaign was basically "America should be run like a business, headed by a likable sports dude semi-celeb" ugh
755 2018-01-08 22:27:14 "I will pour hot oil on your dick in your sleep, honey~." He chimed smiling evilly. "Just kidding~." He hugged him tightly.  "Lemme love you."

773 2018-01-08 22:23:47 Updates are (should be) like an oil change - Lots CAN go wrong (wrong oil, left the drain plug out, didn’t torque the filter), but it’s so routine & standardized that pretty much nothing bad ever happens.
774 2018-01-08 22:23:30 You realize America and the would runs on oil and oil products and natural gas.   It is being done safely everyday and means thousands of jobs.

844 2018-01-08 22:14:39 I can definitely say that the herbs + a dropper of cbd oil a day has kept me in line.
845 2018-01-08 22:14:28 UPDATE: I took the truck downtown to get the oil changed. I’m glad I did! Turns out I’ve been driving it around for a few days, maybe even weeks, with little to no oil in it. Long story short, the truck sounds a lot better now!
846 2018-01-08 22:14:27 Yeah that oil will help. It makes your hair thick too

849 2018-01-08 22:13:54 So I forgot to pack make up remover/wipes and I don’t have any kind of scrub, what’s the best way to take off foundation? Olive oil?
850 2018-01-08 22:13:43 Waiting for my oil change to be done and this old man keeps talking to me while I have my headphones in then yells really loud "you have holes in you're pants why you pay for pants like that" cause bitch I like the pants my man bought me 
851 2018-01-08 22:13:39 Hiya Herman! Plenty of warm blankets. It’s raining today so no walk. I’m very warm & cozy. Moms has her oil diffuser on. Smell good like lemon and rosemary. How are you doing?

853 2018-01-08 22:13:16 I went to shower this morning and someone used the rest of my shampoo so I had 2 other options. My sister's has added oil so I can't use it bc I have naturally oily hair and any added oil makes my hair feel nasty. So now I smell like old spice. And it's disgusting. I want to die.
854 2018-01-08 22:13:11 Check your Transmission oil today.
855 2018-01-08 22:13:09 My baby went and got my car washed, got my oil changed, cleaned & vacuumed the inside and bought a new Bluetooth for it.
856 2018-01-08 22:13:09 I'm in AZ. We often get the same warnings, for good reason. After a time w/out rain, the roads have a lot of oil on them. A little rain w/ the oil & the roads are crazy slick. Need a lot of rain to wash the roads.

858 2018-01-08 22:13:04 I love my Opinel. you have to keep it oiled with mineral oil or olive oil if you  use it on food and to prevent rust. As it get older you get a patina on it.
859 2018-01-08 22:12:49 You should also do a story on how @MeenanServices takes hours to show up to fix a frozen oil line so customers can get heat. Their failure to show up promptly is causing pipes to freeze up.

879 2018-01-08 22:09:46 Oh please my foot.
Oz knowingly sells harmful snake oil to gullible Americans and lies to Congress about it.
Oprah has a long history of promoting people who sell harmful products and tell us to ignore the science.
She's promoted Jenny McCarthy and her child killing beliefs.
880 2018-01-08 22:08:46 I'm reminded just how much Trump is like one of those old-time snake oil salesmen, roaming the countryside, telling the locals what they want to hear and picking their pockets in the process. "You have a sickness that only Trump's Magic Elixir can fix".

953 2018-01-08 21:59:13 Oils like eucalyptus, ginger, black pepper or marjoram etc also soothe pain, but you need to blend them properly in a carrier oil, don't use them directly on your skin they are too strong.

984 2018-01-08 21:54:47 Social media has its pros and cons. It’s a caveat emptor choice to use it and managing its purpose and goals in your life will define how it impacts you personally. We don’t approve of snake oil of course but it’s a free platform. Hope this helps.
985 2018-01-08 21:54:46 I dont leave the house if my coconut oil has melted
986 2018-01-08 21:54:44 Did anyone else on “automatic fuel oil delivery” run out of oil during this frigid weather?
My 86 year old mother did 3am Sunday morning. 
Do I have a right to be pissed?

987 2018-01-08 21:54:40 Bit of oil should sort it! 
988 2018-01-08 21:54:34 @GeneralFinishes Love your product! It’s all I’ve used since I discovered it a few months ago. From the butcher block and salad bowl finishes to the water/oil based stains.
989 2018-01-08 21:54:18 I may be wrong, but I believe the patties are grilled w/oil - soybean.  I know in Canada there's soybean oil in the Angus burger seasonings.

991 2018-01-08 21:54:02 But the foolish virgins did not prepare enough oil, meaning not enough truth and righteousness, though they have to meet Jesus and desire, but in the end but failed to go to the marriage supper of the Lamb, That cannot enter into the Kingdom of heaven.
992 2018-01-08 21:53:53 They also experimented with using nukes for oil fracking-like applications. Nuked a bunch of oil shale in Colorado I believe. We probably shouldn't remind Trump's goons of this.
993 2018-01-08 21:53:43 I think I am failing at girly/beauty topics when I type a google search: how to pick an oil for my... and it completes it with "car". No, google, the oil type for my car is in the manual. There is no manual for my skin and hair, goddamnit! 
994 2018-01-08 21:53:36 Transitioning to a Keto diet? Tip: the first week or two sucks. Throw coconut oil into what you can. The medium chain triglycerides burn faster and allow you to get into ketosis faster as a result.

Venezuela's oil is largely heavy and requires heavy processing and treatment. The $65B loans from China and $9B loans from Russia are likely lost.

When PDVSA's infrastructure degrades it'll take another $90-120B to restore.

1000 2018-01-08 21:52:43 My mom just asked me where the best place to get her oil changed at like I CANT CHANGE A TIRE AND YOU THINK I KNOW A GOOD PLACE TO HAVE WORK DONE
1001 2018-01-08 21:52:28 I didn't say why Africa didn't have many achievements. I only said it doesn't. You argue with this but can't give me many examples. I know about colonization, slavery, oil, American wars, Gaddafi. I never said that Black people are unable to have achievements.
1002 2018-01-08 21:52:20 Oil price, is going up!
It's good and bad for Nigeria,
Obviously because we don't refine locally.
1003 2018-01-08 21:52:07 I'm not for/against Oprah. But can we take a sec & acknowledge that she is responsible for a ton of fake medical types like Dr. Oz, Dr. Phil and a few other charlatans who have been selling snake oil for years now....all of which Harpo profits from. Can we be discerning citizens?
1004 2018-01-08 21:51:49 The CIA has long acted against socialist countries with oil deposits,
e.g. the takeover of Iran from Mossadegh in 1953.
1005 2018-01-08 21:51:21 CIA destabilization of socialist Venezuela whose Hugo Chavez gave hundreds of millions of $ in oil donations to New England has resulted in harm to the Venezuelan oil industry and many food shortages.
1006 2018-01-08 21:51:19 Soooo..you're attributing wildfires to the oil companies? Stupid....
1007 2018-01-08 21:51:10 try coconut oil in your nose.  It works well to coat it because it melts and it smells good.
1008 2018-01-08 21:51:10 It’s funny, we talk about removing drugs. Okay well let’s add this up. Weed if industrialized by the US would bring in over $10 billion a year. Hemp can be used for paper, and 4 billion trees can be saved. Hard drugs can still be illegal, and hemp oil can be used then biproducts.
1009 2018-01-08 21:51:10 Hannah just moped the house with olive oil

1012 2018-01-08 21:50:37 anything with peanuts or too much oil triggers my acne
1013 2018-01-08 21:50:14 « The French cook everything in butter and they live by the Mediterranean » . Well not really. Butter is only used in the northern, northwestern parts of the country. Olive oil is what the Mediterranean French cook with.
1014 2018-01-08 21:50:13 The new chair was appointed by Trump. Power energy interests, ie oil & gas companies, opposed the Perry proposals.
1015 2018-01-08 21:50:02 Honestly. Trying to be down there for less than ten if we’re being truthful. I’m supposed to eat you for longer than it’ll take to get my oil changed? Nooooope.

1017 2018-01-08 21:49:36 Hey think of the money you would have to spend every 2 to 3 months for heating oil in a way it's a lot cheaper
1018 2018-01-08 21:49:32 Harsh and would control the acne but then my face would be dry and spotty with oil 
1019 2018-01-08 21:49:29 Anyone who doesn't #5 should be boiled in oil.
1020 2018-01-08 21:49:22 Come to Nigeria. There are 160 million people waiting for an energy miracle here...people who passionately support anything they believe in. Help us lure a few producers to our country. Entire states with oil money are hoping...

1024 2018-01-08 21:49:00 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
1025 2018-01-08 21:48:43 I put olive oil in my up-facing ear & poked him whenever mine got too loud. It’s tiring.
1026 2018-01-08 21:48:25 You’re welcome! The Marula oil is just what my skin needed 
1027 2018-01-08 21:48:18 A reminder to everyone who has to drive in Los Angeles today: It has been nearly a year since our last decent storm. There is a great deal of oil on the street. Slow down, and keep a safe distance. Stay safe!
1028 2018-01-08 21:48:15 the second sounds about my level of avoiding oil burns
1029 2018-01-08 21:48:12 Lube it up with some olive oil first~

1032 2018-01-08 21:48:07 Europe wanted to diversify, they got what they wish for. Diversification away from Russian crude oil.

1034 2018-01-08 21:48:05 To firm breasts and tighten the skin, mix one teaspoon of vitamin E oil with one tablespoon of yogurt and an egg.
1035 2018-01-08 21:48:05 I use a lot of mychelle products, tea tree oil/Burt’s bees acne roll on! I also have have a Clarisonic and it’s saved my lifeeeee
1036 2018-01-08 21:48:04 peppermint oil :)
1037 2018-01-08 21:48:03 Have you tried a high quality (like doTerra) lavender oil...a drop on her pillow? Chamomille tea?
1038 2018-01-08 21:48:01 Sometimes it takes more than a wash, especially depending on where you live. I would recommend a steam, just heat up some water, drop some tea tree oil in it and get some cotton balls or something to wipe with. (I'm explaining just in case other members of the trans com see this)
1039 2018-01-08 21:47:55 Neither am I. But what exactly can a government do in the short term. It seems to me the NDs are taking proactive steps to support AB industry. I disagree with the pipelines, but it certainly seems to support the oil industry.
1040 2018-01-08 21:47:37 Getting my oil changed whating
1041 2018-01-08 21:47:30 Step right up and buy a pint of Ol' Uncle Don's Magical Medicinal Snake Oil! On sale now for only $999.99!

Side effects include: loss of Dignity and Soul, hand shrinkage, orange complexion, lack of compassion, inability to govern, and spending too much time on the golf course.
1042 2018-01-08 21:47:23 Yep, it's the same! Steady rain coming down, lots of cars with slick streets from the oil and everyone is speeding!  I saw 2 overturned cars!  I only drove 4 miles total...SMH
1043 2018-01-08 21:47:19 wha.. no oil needed.. i hope you know
1044 2018-01-08 21:46:47 i have this groupon for an oil change & a tire rotation, meaning, that’s all i came here for. i’m sure they’ll try to upsell me.
1045 2018-01-08 21:46:38 You missed his logic.  He needed to sign Leon.  If Oil had a built in cap issue next yr someone could have offer sheeted Leon for a number more than cap space.  More than this yr is relevant.
1046 2018-01-08 21:46:22 How thick is your hair and how much do you wash and condition? Also, tea tree oil is a quick fix.
1047 2018-01-08 21:46:04 I may have less than $10 in my account rn but I paid my car payment, car insurance, 3 credit card bills, my Universal, Busch gardens, and sea world pass, got an oil change, paid the WiFi bill and so on all in one check. 
1048 2018-01-08 21:45:27 Because @KamalaHarris is a hack of a senator. Takes money from whomever - including lobbyists, oil&gas, healthcare corps, Wall St etc. She also prefers to protect illegal immigrants over actual citizens in CA. Illegals cost Cali 25 BILLION a year. Supports #sanctuarystates. #NOPE
1049 2018-01-08 21:45:03 What would Jason Kenney have done? He doesn't like to say, except cutting unspecified government programmes and plunging the province into a job-killing austerity. Then he would have cut taxes and increased the debt. Given way our oil assets to foreign multinationals. Goodbye UCP
1050 2018-01-08 21:45:03 i’m waiting for this oil change tho. i NEED it.
1051 2018-01-08 21:45:00 @maggieNYT Drs. Phil, Oz. The Secret, numerous other snake oil bullshits. No thanks, No more TV presidents.
1052 2018-01-08 21:44:40 It includes, an oil change, alignment, 5 tire rotation, and a car wash!
1053 2018-01-08 21:44:24 Wow I broke a bottle of t-tree oil in my room now I can't get the smell gone
1054 2018-01-08 21:44:24 Been wanting to get into oil pulling! You just swish oil right? 
1055 2018-01-08 21:43:58 Damn Near $300 For Ah Oil Change  Oh Well Gotta Keep Lil Mama Wet n Ready.
1056 2018-01-08 21:43:49 Very true! I almost died a month ago due to too many medication I was in the ICU 4 days. I went to my pain Dr and told him this & that I wanted to get on lower Pain  meds and use CBD oil (which doesn’t get me high) he stated he couldn’t work with me then.
1057 2018-01-08 21:43:45 Sir..We do need stronger sanctions..As long they keep getting $$$$ from blood oil sold to the US..They will not leave power making worse for Venazuelans to survive hunger and lack of medicine.@realDonaldTrump please hit them real hard..
1058 2018-01-08 21:43:40 Does anyone know how to do an oil change? Low on money so im looking for someone to do it for free or really cheap

1063 2018-01-08 21:43:09 Colorado hearings on new oil and gas pipeline rules draw fire
1064 2018-01-08 21:43:06 Oh.....some of this is bull.

I'm on automatic delivery. Tank has about 2 gallons left in it. My oil company said I wasn't scheduled for another few days. Why in the neck do I have a contract with them? They are supposed to do all the calculating. Will be empty tonight.
1065 2018-01-08 21:42:52 I have an essential oil diffuser in my bedroom and every time I see the mist out of the corner of my eye I think something in my room is burning
1066 2018-01-08 21:42:49 face washes: I’ve been trying new ones each time i run out, but i especially love Alba products (super affordable) for gentle daily cleansing that ACTUALLY cleans dirt & oil w/o drying me out. All of them are great. their acne dote toner is by FAR my fave of any cheap brand toner
1067 2018-01-08 21:42:31  don't quite have oil paints on hand  but I can absolutely send the original sized file for home printing or something if you'd like! ;A;
1068 2018-01-08 21:42:20 I can’t see how the NDP can brag about this. How did their policies actually helped grow jobs and contribute to the economy? Isn’t it mainly the resilience of Albertans and oil rebounding?
1069 2018-01-08 21:42:19 I second the tea tree oil! It worked for me!
1070 2018-01-08 21:42:04 Of course the farmers will have to work around the oil wells & fracking since all the regs have been thrown out.
1071 2018-01-08 21:41:58 No we f*cking don’t! He just wants to make his oil buddies here and around the world (Russia) richer just like the f*cktard Bushes!
1072 2018-01-08 21:41:55 But what if what is happening in the world right now is actually just a result of the long term effects of excessive coconut oil use.
1073 2018-01-08 21:41:37 ack. that old oil would make me hork.

It's painful. He loves listening to the clapping. He also said he gave people the privelage of voting for him.

1123 2018-01-08 21:35:01 .@realDonaldTrump: That wind farm off the coast of Scotland sullies the view.

Also @realDonaldTrump: Let's open up all the coastal waters to oil rigs.

1125 2018-01-08 21:34:58 Now its Kelf getting traded? Great term, good dollars.  At least you guys have moved off trading Nuge.
1126 2018-01-08 21:34:46 Is it my parmesan fries drizzled with truffle oil, my black olive aioli or my brocolli with shallots, herbs and lemon juice? (It can’t be the medium rare sirloin with peppercorn sauce surely.)
1127 2018-01-08 21:34:43 How about some more climate change denialism in support of oil company profits? That should fix it, right Ducey?

1130 2018-01-08 21:34:27 So we can drink toxic water, breath toxic air, be poisoned by e-coli in our food, die in off-shore drilling rig explosions and pour oil into the oceans, etc. etc. etc.

1139 2018-01-08 21:33:32 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1140 2018-01-08 21:33:32 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
1141 2018-01-08 21:33:13 Just use coconut oil instead! The jars bigger, it lasts longer, and it’s more hydrating
1142 2018-01-08 21:33:04 Oh sorry dear. I have Black Jamaican Castor oil and, Cantu products range from 2k upwards.

1150 2018-01-08 21:32:16 no analyses what so ever. If only oil could rise above $60 a barrel and why does Norway with less oil make billion upon billion whilst UK makes next to nothing by giving tax breaks to major oil companies.
1151 2018-01-08 21:32:12 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
1152 2018-01-08 21:32:07 Everyone just gonna assume Trump wont create a export market for american oil?
1153 2018-01-08 21:32:05 Chances are they are out of buns, patties, cheese, fries, oil to cook fires in, the drink, have no change and prolly about to close when you go up there so ya I'll stick to Hardee's
1154 2018-01-08 21:32:01 Get over it, Dianne.  In southern California, natural seeps represent 98 percent of oil inputs to the offshore zone.  Oil exploration and drilling make up 1%.  Oil that naturally seeps into the Santa Barbara Channel equals ~ 31 “1969” Santa Barbara oil spills since 1970.
1155 2018-01-08 21:31:46 Another question. My bag arrived at my destination last week looking like it had gotten wet. No big deal. It wasn't water. It appears to be an oil stain on my luggage. What is your policy on new luggage being damaged on one of your flights?
1156 2018-01-08 21:31:41 Oil and writer don't mix
1157 2018-01-08 21:31:40 By polluting our land with oil and destroying it with fracking? The only decisions you are making are how to make the rich richer.

1167 2018-01-08 21:30:54 The conservation clock has been set back decades. I wonder how much drilling will actually happen with oil prices relatively low. Not sure about my opinion on the road but crushed by the Pebble permit.
1168 2018-01-08 21:30:50 Found my extra old oil paints ! Wonder if they still work haha
1169 2018-01-08 21:30:43 OIL DIFF: 6.2 -> 6.21
1170 2018-01-08 21:30:37 Gentle reminder that calling for Oprah to be president based on her amazing social conscience is calling for a president who has spent decades pushing woo to the mainstream and given people a general mistrust of experts over snake oil salesmen.
1171 2018-01-08 21:30:35 America needs more oil. All hail Trump for drilling the oceans. #MAGA because going down when you are low is so silly.
1172 2018-01-08 21:30:34 With the current oil price, it's either payment of subsidy or increment of pump price. FG how far nah?

1176 2018-01-08 21:29:54 This is why is a good idea to build more oil pipelines and off shore drilling rigs.

Wait......
1177 2018-01-08 21:29:48 You could try Charlotte's Web CBD oil. It wouldn't hurt.
1178 2018-01-08 21:29:40 i h8 men, pls stop staring at me i'm just trying to get my oil changed
1179 2018-01-08 21:29:34 One thing not said enough, that I just heard on radio, was last yr no one took Oil seriously yet, until the end. This year had target on back, and special tactics for McD, and Oil weren't ready for how much more difficult that role is., how hard to win when all gunning for you.
1180 2018-01-08 21:29:31 Simple oil of cloves...
1181 2018-01-08 21:29:22 if anything, it's the 'peak oil' stuff that was a pretty bad prediction
1182 2018-01-08 21:29:03 well senator shit happens just one thing here when are ya'll gonna take those big ass fans down that are KILLING our birds,see the oil was cleaned up,now clean up your killing device,and take those fans down oh i want the tax dollars paid back too. the oil company paid for theirs

I TOO AM SMILING UNCONTROLLABLY

I WANT TO PUT THIS ON MY WALL AS A GIANT OIL PAINTING
1186 2018-01-08 21:28:47 Lettuce/spinach help sandwiches to feel more substantial, tomatoes unless you don’t like em, salt, pepper, oregano, and oil/vinegar just make it taste good (pretend ur at jersey mikes lmao), I fuck hard w morning star veggie bacon also
1187 2018-01-08 21:28:43 The other guy was a total snake oil salesman.. none of his off the wall ideas made any sense. You would think the propertt is in good shape given it was brand new when it closed. Probably harder to staff up and lease restaurant space than anything else.
1188 2018-01-08 21:28:39 barista said bullet coffee was same as cold brew fog, so I took her up on it and its NOT the same (!!!!)// I'm sitting here drinking BUTTER AND OIL on top of lukewarm espresso wanting to vomit but stomaching it because I paid $5, hear my millennial pain, feel these tears, hold me

1192 2018-01-08 21:28:15 Nobody has answered my question yet!! So do y’all carry baby oil with y’all ready to whip out when its time for sex or is that some porn shit
1193 2018-01-08 21:28:02 Brakes. New tire. Oil change.
1194 2018-01-08 21:27:55 this should be an oil painting hanging in the louvre, titled "don't YOU wish your girlfriend was hot like me"
1195 2018-01-08 21:27:53 Worked at a small grocery store many years back (for min wage). I remember the price of oil fucking with wholesale costs in huge ways...they managed to keep us employed and their retail prices pretty stable.
1196 2018-01-08 21:27:39 Rachel, it's the price of oil.

1202 2018-01-08 21:26:04 I am trying to not go that route.I might if the CBD oil doesn't work but  I think we can make it on our own. Don't wanna take other ppls $. I hate how ppl use it (when don't need it of course). We will have to see. Hopefully CBD will @ least let him talk again
1203 2018-01-08 21:26:00 Use coconut oil for eye make up. Sephora’s beauty water for the rest of your face and it literally just melts right off.
1204 2018-01-08 21:25:45 I saw a document on here McConnell accepted 3.3 to 8.5 million in donations from RUSSIAN OIL to fund Super Packs that would be over & above the 7.35 million.
1205 2018-01-08 21:25:37 Maybe you can try micellar water or using oil to take off makeup
1206 2018-01-08 21:25:24 I’m gas not oil, both more likely decreasing due to lack of market, not production capabilities

1213 2018-01-08 21:24:58 Maybe there is some precious metal, ore, oil, etc. we can extract from here?  Plenty of water for fracking.
1214 2018-01-08 21:24:57 Maybe some oil prince will pity them.
1215 2018-01-08 21:24:53 I've been getting my oil changed early lately. Feels like I'm allowing them to get over on me

1218 2018-01-08 21:24:28 @AmandaWaPo This is exactly what will happen if Trump brings offshore oil drilling back to the west coast.

1226 2018-01-08 21:23:19 you'll get addicted to the building because you can build so much shit and you find shit everywhere like that oil can I told you to grab last week the oil you get from that can go to making a gun mod

1228 2018-01-08 21:23:17 Lol why does my oil change always cost damn near 100 dollars, I miss the days of having to pay 35-40 bucks smh.
1229 2018-01-08 21:23:15 Beauty Tip: Greek yogurt makes a great face mask. Mix it with tumeric, honey, olive oil, egg whites, oatmeal, or the ashes of your dead relatives.
1230 2018-01-08 21:23:06 Just came back from church, and I'm luking for my 5h. It's my only money in d house; and I've planned to use it and buy stuffs in d neighborhood to break my fast. So, I put rice on fire. Pour red oil on top. Slice onion join. Put Maggi. Close pot. It's boiling.

1234 2018-01-08 21:22:55 Ok so I worked & have a lot of sources there, this is twaddle. The fact is they're tired of the UN aid mafia in the camps. The UN and its friends are not welcome in Iraq; oil for food, aka let them die of tetanus while we get rich, is a living memory; so is Fallujah's AQ office.

1237 2018-01-08 21:22:27 You've had to put up with mostly honest coverage of your total lack of fitness for the office for which you were running. Unfortunately, the only qualification for the Presidency was whether or not you could find enough folks gullible enough to buy the snake oil you were selling.
1238 2018-01-08 21:22:16 I JUST went through this. if you buy space heaters  I really recommend springing for the radiating oil type though a bit more $.
1239 2018-01-08 21:22:10 I'm trying to find the coconut/carrot oil tweet. Can someone please send a link?
1240 2018-01-08 21:22:01 There have been other oilspills or  leaks since then on the Central Coast of California. Out of control drilling will lead to more accidents. We have pulled back from thousands of oil wells on land for a reason. Let’s not pollute our coastal waters.
1241 2018-01-08 21:22:00 Gorgeous. You remind me of Aja Naomi King. 

Btw, I've been implementing your oil last tip.

1253 2018-01-08 21:21:23 Also I didn’t have sesame oil or garlic/chilli sauce so I crushed some sesame seeds and mixed garlic oil in instead, but I guess tahini would work and also garlic purée and oil?
1254 2018-01-08 21:21:15 Way worse. Like 6 mos of ppl’s oil and grease and shit magically coating the highway after that rain shower.
1255 2018-01-08 21:21:14 As it is people are still coming to terms with the whole inflation/interest rate/gold trade. And oil..another one that surprised.

1258 2018-01-08 21:21:05 Oooh is it coal mining?  I bet it's turning farmland into coal mines!  Or oil?
1259 2018-01-08 21:20:53 Chillies freeze very well or in a nice olive oil.
Tom's will also freeze or I make lots of sauces that store for ages nicely #GardensHour
1260 2018-01-08 21:20:51 How does that fact make it less cruel?
1261 2018-01-08 21:20:44 Oh I get a day off tomorrow, I could draw or, get my oil changed.

1265 2018-01-08 21:20:11 Waiting patiently here on $OIL and only have a small position. I want to see one more bounce to short (~62.50), these types of moves rarely just turn and break down, they'll usually form a double/top, or weak highs with divergences before going. Why I scale in to setups 
1266 2018-01-08 21:20:05 fucking love oil ocean man
1267 2018-01-08 21:20:01 Very happy to see Sheikh Mohamed as the Oil Minister he always has the best interest of Bahrain at heart have had the pleasure of interacting with him a true gentleman and a thorough professional.

1272 2018-01-08 21:19:31 @MMFlint I want to invest in your Mar A Largo fracking operation. Where do I send the check to? Thank you President @realDonaldTrump for opening up off shore drilling. This will be a great investment.

1273 2018-01-08 21:19:21 He starts CBD (marijuana) oil this week. Finally we got into a study & it's free!! We've waited 2 yrs 4 this.
1274 2018-01-08 21:19:17 God oh God please do not let this happen. Oprah the pseudoscience and snake oil pushing billionaire and a wrestler. It's like @realDonaldTrump all wrapped up in one. Let's #RaiseTheBar

1279 2018-01-08 21:18:55 lets get this straight
only militaries need oil
and only the 1% & corporations need militaries 
to protect their interests
1280 2018-01-08 21:18:48 Oil and gas ni
1281 2018-01-08 21:18:42 Too many churches are filled with snake oil salesmen I agree. Joel Osment instantly comes to mind. But if it helps ppl, I'm for it.
1282 2018-01-08 21:18:39 My thoughts exactly. So the question is will the yuan oil contract cause a run on physical in the west? For that to happen paper price in east must b > than west to begin with.
1283 2018-01-08 21:18:29 Coconut oil literally made all my problems disappear my split ends, girlfriend & pimples. Everything.
1284 2018-01-08 21:18:14 Can't tell Olive oil in the pink shorts she don't have cakes
1285 2018-01-08 21:18:12 The people at the car place just asked if I wanted to pay to get everything else that's wrong with my car fixed as if I didn't just pay for my oil change with a coupon for a free oil change I won at school lol

1287 2018-01-08 21:18:05 Perhaps she should use her amazing prophetic powers to find oil or search for missing people, instead of speculating about legends online.
1288 2018-01-08 21:18:05 @jennajameson I love how Trump rescinded the Obama Administration’s bans on offshore drilling on coastal areas. We need oil and gas more than ever! Trump knows that. That’s why voting matters!
1289 2018-01-08 21:18:04 Getting an oil change and car wash in the same day really makes you feel like you have your life together.
1290 2018-01-08 21:17:56 Depends on the cause and if that cause has a powerful lobby. If burning fossil fuels hypothetically caused climate change leading to global cooling (instead of warming), the oil industry would do the same as it currently is to dismiss the science.

1293 2018-01-08 21:17:34 I've used 3 of Lush's deodorants and 1 wasn't strong enough/my skin did not react well with the other 2. I actually use coconut oil and that usually works really well!
1294 2018-01-08 21:17:25 The global oil/gas economy is just that - global. Thinking we can throw up some offshore platforms and lower our at-the-pump costs is unrealistic.
1295 2018-01-08 21:17:25 Well they aren’t claiming any such thing! You’ve just taken it upon yourself to go looking for people to attack. I’m sorry about your friend but that doesn’t give you any right to be rude to people. This is just a food post get over yourself. It’s also cooked in oil & with carbs.
1296 2018-01-08 21:17:17 Or coconut oil!

1303 2018-01-08 21:16:38 Rockefeller had seven or eight businesses fail before he started standard oil.   If you aren't familiar with the standard oil story and how persistent John Rockefeller might want to read a bit.  Your own words betray the fact you have never started a business.
1304 2018-01-08 21:16:37 Lol. Special oil.

1310 2018-01-08 21:15:49 The US has 27 million acres of oil/gas leases unused due to low per barrel prices. The US is already a net exporter of refined petroleum. The entire production of the Deepwater Horizon had been presold by British Petroleum to China.
1311 2018-01-08 21:15:45 Are you saying oil drilling hasn’t evolved in nearly 50 years?! 
1312 2018-01-08 21:15:36 Eh I thought we were oil

1315 2018-01-08 21:15:17 We need to stop thinking oil is the only or main answer. Tesla, and other electric vehicles have shown by their high sales that we are ready for alternative energy vehicles. Thankfully our Governor will help fight even Secretary Tillerson who was Exxon CEO says oil isn’t the way
1316 2018-01-08 21:15:09 @MBuhari couldn't care less, they're all brothers connected via umbilical oil pipeline cord... Worse, it starts appearing that it may be true that World leaders @theresa_may do not follow own advice of @HRC #Equality #cabinetreshuffle #AfricanLivesMatter  #Biafra #Ambazonia
1317 2018-01-08 21:15:04 I hear ya but your 27 year old one is made way better for cooking. We use olive oil and have used beef lard. Many use flax seed.
Now I'm hungry...

1324 2018-01-08 21:13:46 That expression was popularized by George W. Bush in his race against Al Gore. Then he went and killed a million Iraqis for their oil, not to mention over four thousand American soldiers.
1325 2018-01-08 21:13:46 Just got a Derma roller guysjust waiting on the oil that comes with it should I post a video on it let me know 
1326 2018-01-08 21:13:46 I think a lot of the turnaround with the amateur side came with Bob Green (aside from his blind spot on all things Oil Kings). MacT had a few really tough drafts...

1328 2018-01-08 21:13:46 Tea tree and Argan Oil are the reason I look like a 12 year old when i have no makeup on
1329 2018-01-08 21:13:42 Best part about doing your own oil change is knowing what you are putting in and not depending on a lazy mechanic lol
1330 2018-01-08 21:13:35 Irony is it will help oil stocks AND green stocks as the rising price of cobalt and political/social concerns in DRC
1331 2018-01-08 21:13:34 And the fact that Nigerians are 2xxx GH tells you how pathetic it is to compare any thing to gh BTW.

If it wasn't for your curropt leaders there should never be any comparison ever. Cox even the oil money alone sha

Reading and comprehension are supposed to go hand in hand.
Pay attention, skippy.
1341 2018-01-08 21:12:29 ....Or I tend to forget something in my trunk and have to look for it... for a very long time.   Maybe check my oil level...
1342 2018-01-08 21:12:27 The UN and UK screwed that region up bad before the USA stuck it's nose in and further complicated things. Let's remember the whole region is full of oil and religious strife, if the US didn't stick it's nose in someone else would.
1343 2018-01-08 21:12:27 Don't use too much oil
1344 2018-01-08 21:12:19 There’s clearly a level of clubs that can and do spend inordinate amounts of players. PSG, Manchester clubs, Barca, Real Madrid, & maybe Bayern. Oil money or Russian money, they don’t hold back on acquiring the top players making them the favorites every year to win trophies.

1362 2018-01-08 21:09:16 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1363 2018-01-08 21:09:05 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

He's a stooge with an agenda.  For instance, he released the emails from climatologists, but none from Big Oil and deniers?

1379 2018-01-08 21:06:27 @nicolconcilio I saw you put coconut oil under your sweet sweat, why is that???
1380 2018-01-08 21:06:10 I bailed on my healthy eating to get chips and karma hit me HARD these are the worst chips ever they are literally so greasy I can feel the oil oozing into my mouth as I bite into them 
1381 2018-01-08 21:06:03 Seems like a lot of dirty money flows through the oil and gas industry oligarchs everywhere.

1385 2018-01-08 21:05:30 Yeah I hear ya. Grease makes me feel sick so I try to use butter if I'm frying something because oil grosses me out. Air fryers are healthier too :)

1405 2018-01-08 21:03:33 This is Hilary Kelley, Salt Queen, reporting from the field where she has been waiting for an oil change for over an hour.
1406 2018-01-08 21:03:33 Your coconut oil is the best I've tried

1415 2018-01-08 21:02:33 Gold, Oil and Drugs
1416 2018-01-08 21:02:32 Does a man who has opened up oil drilling offshore of every inch of coastline in America love the country of love money?
1417 2018-01-08 21:01:50 I am sick of these high oil prices/law needs 2 B, No exports unless gas is below $2.00 a gallon/Home heating oil needs to be below $1.50 per gallon/we are getting robbed/supply & demand determines price/low supply, high demand, high price/high supply, low demand, low price/get it

1421 2018-01-08 21:01:42 You guys know very well that this is a load of crap. Coconut oil is one of the healthiest things on earth. By the way, glad to hear AHA president doing well, after his recent heart attack.
1422 2018-01-08 21:01:40 It's not right he's only trying to educate and show the harm caused by ignorance, climate change and the effect of oil drilling off our coasts. How about a swap, let Dan continue to educate with his photos and ban all pitcures of Trump making faces 
1423 2018-01-08 21:01:40 I highkey want him to pay for me to get my oil changed next week, so I’m trying to be nice right lmfaooo
1424 2018-01-08 21:01:39 He's probably never heard of it. Or it's fake news. Oil spills are a Chinese conspiracy
1425 2018-01-08 21:01:26 Here, the State must use COINED STIMULUS to subsidize the OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS from these Natural Disasters proximately CAUSES by UNREGULATED Oil & Gas activities. It is patently unreasonable to redistribute the COSTS onto the People.
1426 2018-01-08 21:01:22 Alaska hire first. Not miners/oil workers brought up by their companies. We lifelong Alaskans did the dirty work build the pipeline & yet we are thrown by the wayside!Alaskan hire first! Represent Alaskans before you represent your donors! Or be voted out! Stand with Alaskans!
1427 2018-01-08 21:01:09 Excise tax on petroleum products will likely cause the derailment of the TRAIN. Since we're still mostly dependent on imported petrol, any increase in retail prices of oil would automatically translate to higher prices of basic goods and services.
1428 2018-01-08 21:01:06 OIL DIFF: 6.24 -> 6.24
1429 2018-01-08 21:01:01 It amazes me that the supposedly most conservative part of Canada has such a limited understanding of economics. The oil industry created the supply glut and low prices. Now we see the logical drive to reduce labour costs (cut jobs). Not governments, the industry.
1430 2018-01-08 21:00:59 Woowwwwwww i lost my oil pen. I am PISSED
1431 2018-01-08 21:00:57 Ok first of all, you’re so kind & I love you! And my skin is super sensitive to gluten & processed sugars so I cut down on those a lot & got a facial spin brush & kept up with my skincare routine & my skin got better  also grapeseed oil & tea tree oil are AMAZING
1432 2018-01-08 21:00:47 Perhaps but modern ICE is pretty reliable. Most service issues around electrical, interior and chassis, I suspect. Haven't touched the engine in my Accord for 11 years except oil changes.

1435 2018-01-08 21:00:22 Chuckie i am WEAK. And btw i go to duke of oil to get my oil changed haha @satorifyb

1437 2018-01-08 21:00:02 @DanMaduri Nothing I want to do more than sit on Caspersun Beach and watch some hillbilly oil derek worker from Mississippi urinate into the Gulf. Please don't drill Florida.
1438 2018-01-08 20:59:36 Didn’t realize bitching about being sick on social media meant everyone and their mother was going to offer their snake oil BS “remedies.” If oregano oil worked better than cough medicine, why aren’t doctors prescribing that 
1439 2018-01-08 20:59:26 Throw that shit away....na I'm joking sauté that shit in some oil, salt, pepper, garlic
1440 2018-01-08 20:59:22 Wait. In 1000 years you don’t think earth will be powered by non-fossil fuel energy? If you think we NEED fossil fuels to survive as societies then do yiu see a future when there is no oil and we all just fold up and die?

There isnt an unlimited amount of these fuels.
1441 2018-01-08 20:59:16 After shower wipe armpits using witch hazel, then apply a THIN layer of organic virgin coconut oil. Works longer than any aluminum containing deodorant. Not much help with wetness but does control odor better than what's pictured below.
1442 2018-01-08 20:59:09 i keep a quart of medicated coconut oil next to the stove and have to actively tell myself not to medicate *everything* i eat
1443 2018-01-08 20:58:56 Pretending oil and gas is an anachronism is delusional. Quebec city gets most of its power from hydroquebec for electricity, 96% but the province needs hydrocarbons. So does the city for day to day functions. Sorry to intrude on the narrative that makes you happy.
1444 2018-01-08 20:58:54 I know people who push CBD oil for its medical uses who claim it kills cancer, but I haven't been impressed by what I've seen. I'd recommend Curcumin mixed with something like coconut oil applied topically to the lesions. Curcumin is better than CBD oil at killing cancers, IMO.
1445 2018-01-08 20:58:49 Especially since we don’t need it! We’re exporting oil! The only reason for this is to make the Exxon Mobiles etc even more profitable! Not worth a drop of oil on my beautiful cape cod beaches!
1446 2018-01-08 20:58:34 I like full service especially in cold & wet weather. Yeah, I can pump my own, too. But, it can get messy at times. I think there's a big opportunity to go full service (oil and tire check, clean the winshield) to get more customers. New Jersey still has a law against giveaways.
1447 2018-01-08 20:58:22 There's still a surprising amount of Chia support among Oil fans calling/texting in to Oilers Now. Not 50+%, but still > 0% haha.

わぁぁ！そんなそんな！
嬉しいです
1450 2018-01-08 20:58:10 I agree with Daniel and my reasoning is that I had to contort myself too many times to replace oil pressure sensors on the 2.7L V6 sludge-maker.
1451 2018-01-08 20:57:57 When you think it’ll be great to open your doors and windows to let the scents of fresh rain in, and you forget that the primary scents the first rains in LA bring out are oil and tar.
1452 2018-01-08 20:57:46 Just waiting on you to let me baby oil some models
1453 2018-01-08 20:57:44 This man come sit onside me smelling like motor oil 
1454 2018-01-08 20:57:39 I suppose your selected people will give you a great town hall. The people your new taxes affect can't afford to attend and give you a piece of their mind. It costs me more for gas, heating oil, electricity, food, & everything else; your dam carbon tax. Regulate corps don't tax
1455 2018-01-08 20:57:38 I was scared for a second you were going to say @SecretaryZinke legalized manatee hunting for purpose of oil independence.

1462 2018-01-08 20:56:55 The largest oil spill in California history is the Lakeview Gusher. You should check your facts
1463 2018-01-08 20:56:44 Bold. This Oil Drilling of the coast of each state with access to the ocean is going to be challenged and defeated by all states of its people. Nobody wants to see a sunrise or sunset off an oil rig shimmering in the distance. Thank you for your time.

1466 2018-01-08 20:56:14 Like your unhinged snake oil boss, drumpf is patently not fit for office, due to severe mental impairment. HE'S A NARCISSISTIC, SOCIOPATH. He's NOT a smart businessman, SIX FAILED hotel & casino businesses show that. He HAD to use russian money - no sane US bank would lend to him
1467 2018-01-08 20:56:00 I made a scrub out of coffee, brown sugar, and olive oil and it made skin feel really good. But I'm snowed in w/ the heat blasting so two days later I'm back at maximum ash.
1468 2018-01-08 20:55:57 I wouldn't let nobody call me oil can or catfish 
1469 2018-01-08 20:55:55 I would say 60% of the now moaners/haters would not get to see their beloved arsenal if we hadn’t made the move.
Yes we could have stayed at hibury. But it’s called moving with the times. 

City had a stadium built for them. 
United already biggest stadium I believe.

1470 2018-01-08 20:55:54 Diesel is distilled from crude oil.
1471 2018-01-08 20:55:48 Sounds like I have a few tiny oil leaks. My brother is the shop manager, so I don't think he'd steer my in the wrong direction.  Hopefullly
1472 2018-01-08 20:55:37 agree, but think it starts with great scouting, & Oilers don’t have! PC was convinced by Scouting to go after Griffin Reinhardt.  Oil gave up two draft spots, sent him to the minors then left exposed to Vegas, & still isn’t in the NHL. Got zero in return for those draft choices
1473 2018-01-08 20:55:27 For natural hairstyles I just use good ol eco styler the clear one. But for straight hair I heard hicks is good any edge control that doesn’t convert into an oil
1474 2018-01-08 20:55:11 The current oil sands investors, combined, couldn’t come up with the capital that any single one of the major players that left could spend. Not even close.
1475 2018-01-08 20:55:03 finally getting my oil change 
1476 2018-01-08 20:54:51 #UEN  i bought 15000 today in the 70s Got january update which could see it hit £1.20. Im looking for £1.50 by end of March. 2150bpd pays 8% dividend.  And has a shed load of oil. With a mkt cap of ONLY 9m!  Lack of freefloat about! Should be worth at least 40 million!
1477 2018-01-08 20:54:43 Yeah, I'm watching it. I'd like to try the cleaner vegan diet. No oil and no sugar. I have crap willpower.
1478 2018-01-08 20:54:41 The Trump administration’s disastrous new 5-year offshore drilling plan endangers our marine life and coastal communities with the risk of catastrophic oil spills, and threatens jobs and economies. Here are each of the 22 coastal states that will be negatively affected: (1/5)
1479 2018-01-08 20:54:34 Trump will destroy our planet. Oil spills and increase in CO2 output will occur in America. Plastics in oceans, cancer increases, more extinctions. But Coal and oil will thrive. Income gap will grow and poverty will rise. Thanks Trump for ruining our country and planet.
1480 2018-01-08 20:54:33 I have Thieves essential oil in a diffuser going non-stop in our home! Great for germs and it works!! Recipes online!
1481 2018-01-08 20:54:32 Its indeed a beautiful day, thanks for asking
1482 2018-01-08 20:54:24 with hydro dams accounting for 96% of the electricity produced here. However, this abundance of electrical production only covers 40% of the province’s energy needs ... a majority of the energy in Quebec comes from oil and natural gas. Oil is even the top import $13.7 billion
1483 2018-01-08 20:54:22 Geez, good thing North Korea doesn't have oil. Does he realize the number of rockets and artilleries NK aimed at SK? Does he really think the Iron Dome can block all that? Hah, NK is not some freedom fighters who shoots a few rockets at Israel.
1484 2018-01-08 20:54:19 got my tires put on my car saturday, alignment finna get put on my car today & friday im getting my oil change, im proud of myself  my papa came through fr tho

1486 2018-01-08 20:53:58 I'm surprised to see the impact on Europe of this Chinese ban. I was assuming (or hoping?) there would be industrial scale capacity in Europe by now to handle #plastic waste and process it for #recycling. (Though crude oil price affects the economic viability of course.)

1488 2018-01-08 20:53:38 @juliemason we need derricks off the coast of maro lago. Trump tried to move flight patterns from palm beach airport. He’d love oil drilling

1491 2018-01-08 20:53:34 Not all antivaxxers are essential oil people but all essential oil people are antivaxxers. Two birds, one defriend.

1494 2018-01-08 20:53:22 And I’m hoping a good soak and a course of bio oil is going to work wonders or I’m going to have some nasty scars, at least I’ve never liked my legs and wear tights with dresses 95% of the time anyway 
1495 2018-01-08 20:53:17 Yes I boil them in salt water and put chili oil and red pepper flakes on top. Can literally eat like a full pound in one sitting.
1496 2018-01-08 20:53:07 Tea tree oil is the cure for acne and acne scars
1497 2018-01-08 20:52:59 I assume, Trump is working in this direction. 
I outlined 3 highest priorities for him- and he seems very AWARE.
[1. Military, missile defense; 2. Law: judges, vote, FBI/DOJ; 3. Immigration, border, deportation, H1-B fraud, etc.]
The rest follows: taxes, regulations, infra, oil.
1498 2018-01-08 20:52:51 It was a good plan when it was put into place but the silly TV money and oil gazillionaires in the years since shifted the paradigm. Otherwise we would be a mid table club at best.
1499 2018-01-08 20:52:26 Tea tree oil on pimples :)
1500 2018-01-08 20:52:26 I'm no Democrat, but some of us independents don't want our coastal waters handed off to oil companies and more mountains shredded by strip mining. @realDonaldTrump is giving US to corporate interests, and high-paying foreign interests like China, Saudi Arabia & Russia.
1501 2018-01-08 20:52:25 Oil cunts.
1502 2018-01-08 20:52:24 #Contango = trading term & happens under MANY circumstances that are not nefarious
To further confound efforts to determine accurate accounting of global oil reserves~
A large % of reserves are now stored underground.
1503 2018-01-08 20:52:13 Without political will from PMB there are many ways to deplete the foreign reserve. CBN can decide to defend the naira with FX they receive from sale of crude oil or FG will fully reintroduce subsidies on fuel and fertilizer.
1504 2018-01-08 20:52:08 I need an oil change again 
1505 2018-01-08 20:51:56 People can get their oil changed, fill up their tank with gas, eat some snacks, and gamble while waiting for their car. it's a one stop shop.
1506 2018-01-08 20:51:37 Yeah!! Tbh the darkness of the water kinda spooked me with it being such a deep saturated blue but thats just my irrational fear of deep dark blue water!  the mint oil was great for my sinuses as well since ive been sick!
1507 2018-01-08 20:51:28 bruh why they taking so long for this damn oil change man!!!
1508 2018-01-08 20:51:10 Mine is pretty expensive because of all the healthy products I eat lol (WholeFoods!) bcuz I had to start tackling my skin from the inside outOther than food, it’s $12 oil free serum, $4 soap bar and $5 sheet masks as my staples
1509 2018-01-08 20:51:09 Bad day? Feeling low on self esteem? Girl, make your way to the local gas station. I promise there’s at least 3 construction workers or oil field guys who will act like you’re the best lookin woman they’ve ever seen.

1512 2018-01-08 20:51:02 April 14th King of the Commonwealth race @vamotorspeedway and the Outlaw and Lucas Oil boy's are off that weekend! This should be a good one
1513 2018-01-08 20:50:57 IMO, oil could have another spike in the tank. XLE due to start rolling over. Would love to see oil strength w/ XLE weakness
1514 2018-01-08 20:50:38 The guy who changed my oil is gonna give me free windshield wipers if I let him take me out, sounds fair
1515 2018-01-08 20:50:22 @TheCurrentCBC  So much for the US minding its own business. Does Iran have oil and is it located in a strategic geographical location and also hated by Israel? Yes but this is all about freedom and democracy, right?? Give me a break.
1516 2018-01-08 20:50:15 Soybean oil is typical for that application, although less so lately now that the toxic effects have become too obvious to ignore.
1517 2018-01-08 20:49:58 #US Oil fracking transformed the world oil trade ~
-putting the global price completely under the control of the #US
Not unlike #OPEC in 1970's=#US is now the #SwingOilProducer
We control oil prices
Let's see just how far #WH allows global price 2climb 2benefit foreign producers
1518 2018-01-08 20:49:57 I bought Mason beard oil for Christmas, and he refuses to wear it unless I put it on him
1519 2018-01-08 20:49:47 I put oil on my face bc it was kinda dry and y’all it’s sooo nice omg
1520 2018-01-08 20:49:39 So we all pay for the rich sheiks and oil corporations to get richer while the working slaves get poorer!
1521 2018-01-08 20:49:39 so technology in oil industry has remained static?  No changes since 1969? Perhaps a real problem in CA are the homeless and the #OpioidCrisis
1522 2018-01-08 20:49:36 Exo 30:25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.

1524 2018-01-08 20:49:32 lol You're saying that the ppl who donated to Trump campaign were not Wall St and oil billionaires? And as for the "tax bit" I have no idea what you're insinuating by " ya and low income earners not paying any taxes isn't a big deal."

1528 2018-01-08 20:48:57 Are you self medicating???
Free market dictates rates. Estevan SK Tim’s employees were making $20/hr back when oil was high. Supply and demand. Down with socialism!!!
1529 2018-01-08 20:48:53 Also getting my oil changed and stuck at the dealership until its done :c
1530 2018-01-08 20:48:51 Forever wishing my boyfriend didn't mind the smell of tea tree oil. It helps my skin SO MUCH but he HATES it lol...
1531 2018-01-08 20:48:45 Please @KatyTurNBC, get over yourself already, and @MichaelWolffNYC not only sells his book like snake oil salesman but looks the part
1532 2018-01-08 20:48:29 Pats still have the edge, if only by the virtue of the TB12 Snake Oil sideshow

1534 2018-01-08 20:48:15 That's one of the main reasons #TrumpRussia ran for POTUS! He wants oil & to control oil! #RexTillerson was chosen for this purpose. Tillerson has Russian connections regarding the oil industry #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachPence

1537 2018-01-08 20:47:51 Problem in the oil patch is finance can push the price higher but the  end users do not benefit from either the higher price or the credit that does the pushing. 

Over time the oil price falls to what the end user can afford = less every day.
1538 2018-01-08 20:47:50 "سيئين الظن لأنفُسِهم يُسيؤون"
1539 2018-01-08 20:47:48 The only fools are those that think that if any other country had the same oil reserves we do that they would let it sit in the ground.
1540 2018-01-08 20:47:27 Put my car back on F now I gotta see about tryna get a oil change.
1541 2018-01-08 20:47:24 Fall rain, fall rain fall, wash weh di oil n di power weh dem sprinkle ah di stall!!!!!
1542 2018-01-08 20:47:21 Settle down, Senator. Oil drilling and production has continued there on existing offshore federal leases to this day. Surely you know this right?  .@BretBaier .@IngrahamAngle
1543 2018-01-08 20:47:11 Giving my car an oil change, she better love me
1544 2018-01-08 20:47:05 Indy White Paper was a lie how? Baby boxes don’t save lives? Are you sure? Oil prices are a lie? Controversial. NHS waiting times are a lie ? Are they? Your question regarding 45% is a lie? Is it? Currency is a lie? Radical.  Lots of nonsense.
1545 2018-01-08 20:47:03 We've all:
Done vitamins. Lots.
Weird diets
No milk
No wheat
No milk wheat meat or fruit. Or sugar
No anything because maybe fasting helps
Iodine
Thyroid support 'concoctions'
Potassium
Base
Acid
No nightshade
More fruit
More water
Cleanses
Castor oil packs
Etc..etc...etc
1546 2018-01-08 20:47:02 Yep. After a few months everything was cleaned up and back to normal. It was like the oil spill never happened. 

Great point.
1547 2018-01-08 20:47:01 LA Times is reporting that there is weak demand for offshore licenses due to the expense and low oil prices.
1548 2018-01-08 20:46:35 Tea tree oil is my new favorite #NaturalRemedy #MiracleCure
1549 2018-01-08 20:46:27 Tillertson doesn't need .Head of Exxon. Think more after he resigns.Big Russian oil deal  gets done. Follow the money!!
1550 2018-01-08 20:46:26 Does you statement include oil speculation?
1551 2018-01-08 20:46:24 @GOPLeader Stand up and stop the proposed drilling  for oil and gas off the West coast!! The Koch brothers and other billionaires are running this country. It will hurt all of us. Killing fish and wildlife is wrong and you know it!
1552 2018-01-08 20:46:13 Basically castor oil
1553 2018-01-08 20:46:07 god bless jess for this bigass bottle of tea tree oil i luv her
1554 2018-01-08 20:45:59 Great....what are you gon a do about our dependence on oil then? Any way you drill for oil can cause major problems
1555 2018-01-08 20:45:56 سُبحان الله وبحمده.

1556 2018-01-08 20:45:54 I was gifted “Pure,” which is a cleansing oil, & kinda love it.
1557 2018-01-08 20:45:43 This handkerchief and oil thing na lowkey business... Just tell one babe to allow you 'handkerchief' her, then she'll 'oil' you... Una go dey live la vida loca
1558 2018-01-08 20:45:43 Why are you so opposed to increasing Americans oil production and releasing us from OPEC reliance?
1559 2018-01-08 20:45:42 Doesn't it make your hair really dry? My hairdresser said that it dries your hair out and takes all the oil out. I wash my hair 3 times a week
1560 2018-01-08 20:45:29 With Oil going 70+, don’t think the Saudis won’t rush this IPO to unload it end of year
1561 2018-01-08 20:45:23 When you take a hit of oil and it reminds you of the state fair
1562 2018-01-08 20:45:18 I think I would not really trust her even if she ran on this platform because like... so much precedent of snake oil and strange dishonesty that have resulted in literal epidemics.
1563 2018-01-08 20:45:12 I vow to stay a petition to have you removed from office. You you don't like oil drilling so using a vehicle.
1564 2018-01-08 20:45:07 Basq oil. I'm telling you.
1565 2018-01-08 20:45:07 Arnica is good for sore muscles, but if you have any broken skin(chafing, scratches) they will NOT heal. Comfrey balm is also good - if in an oil it might stain. I mixed a balm and clove oil (dilute in another oil) for something that fixes muscles and injuries.
1566 2018-01-08 20:45:06 @darrellissa let's get out of this course going no where but destruction w/ fossil fuels! haven't u let oil spills, coal & gases do enough damage? we're moving on to better fuel for us & the planet! get ur head out of ur ass & look around, it's 2018! #NeverEverTrustarepublican
1567 2018-01-08 20:45:03 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1568 2018-01-08 20:44:48 Spilled baby oil allll on my Ugg’s what do I do 
1569 2018-01-08 20:44:46 Opened part 1 of oil short at 61.8 in case we don't make it above 62. If it does reach higher target as expect, I'll add to position #OOTT #WTIC
1570 2018-01-08 20:44:45 I'm a Florida resident that you don't represent.
You can't whine about Florida's environment if you're going to let our Natl Parks become strip pits and oil fields.
Always remember: you lost your presidential bid to a TV reality star. He called you "little Marco" & you took it.

I want to know about whiteheads under my eyes my under eyes are extremely dry I started using honey mixed with castor oil and aloevera it's working what to do for white heads 
Can I use honey and lemon mixture
1575 2018-01-08 20:43:48 No, it's to do with cannabis oil that can to help treat epilepsy and “a number of other medical conditions”.

1577 2018-01-08 20:43:43 pretty sure I had the most traumatizing weekend: I knocked a cup of water onto my new set of watercolor paints, I found an open sharpie spilling ink onto my bed, spilled a ton of nail oil onto my phone, and to top it off #btsoutcastD5
1578 2018-01-08 20:43:43 Carbon pilicy!  Now there's a snake oil product.  As long as I pay for it you'll look away.
1579 2018-01-08 20:43:38 Today’s mood is eating half a loaf of toasted rosemary olive oil bread before anyone comes home and catches me
1580 2018-01-08 20:43:30 , my dear I serious need the prayers.
But i don break sha, na 6 to 6 things.
One day down, 6 more days to go...
If na for where oil rice day, we need the eyes to eat the food wella. So no plucking out. I gladly fail this temptation  
1581 2018-01-08 20:43:18 My front differential broke  out of the blue..no explanation...oil was changed by me. They told me i hv to change the gear box ( which works fine) bcs its the same piece...theyre charging me US 13.000 at  @Subaru_Chile #subaruxv #subaruchile #scam
1582 2018-01-08 20:43:11 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for vaginal jade eggs, and put some jasmine essential oil in my diffuser.
1583 2018-01-08 20:43:01 Oil change on the Z71
1584 2018-01-08 20:42:55 it's amazing the number of vegetables that can be turned from average to amazing with a bit of olive oil, some rock salt, and some herbs
1585 2018-01-08 20:42:54 I love when my sister oil my braids 
1586 2018-01-08 20:42:49 Geez, Oil spills happen, so do FIRES and FLOODs thanks to DemoRAT concepts about forestry, park lands, and failure to allow tree cutting. DemoRATS like Feinstein and the failed Harvard Graduate who NEVER had a real job Schumer are too stupid to represent Americans.
1587 2018-01-08 20:42:38 No drilling for oil and gas off the West coast!! It will hurt ALL OF US by disturbing fish and wildlife. Forget the Koch brothers and the other billionaires pushing for this.  It is wrong and you know it.  Green energy is the answer.
1588 2018-01-08 20:42:36 Because they ate paid by US oil money to shut down Canadian oil. @tides
1589 2018-01-08 20:42:29 Absolutely. That's why I'm going full electric instead of hybrid. No more oil changes!
1590 2018-01-08 20:42:29 Cali has 12mil ppl more than Tx. More than that, Asian Im/Ex. Tx is mostly LNG/Oil, Cali is huge container ships. Trump got 4mil votes in Cali and 4.6 mil in Tx. (Approx). Silicon Valley!
1591 2018-01-08 20:42:12 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1592 2018-01-08 20:42:10 Added coconut oil to my face mask. I think coconut oil is the most versatile thing on the planet.
1593 2018-01-08 20:42:09 Best @GlossyboxUK for a long time  my face smells amazing thanks to the Dr Bontanics facial oil 
1594 2018-01-08 20:42:04 you too, @waldholz ! Also, that oil podcast was epic. SO good.
1595 2018-01-08 20:41:58 if we talking about war and oil, im not. im talking about representing a country and trump by far is the worse representation of a president in modern day history.

1597 2018-01-08 20:41:46 How about we not let two celebrities run in 2020 just because Oprah made a nice speech. There are qualified female politicians that make nice speeches all the time that haven't endorsed Dr. Oz's snake oil

1599 2018-01-08 20:41:06 the oil deadass burned my entire face i don’t deserve this
1600 2018-01-08 20:40:55 How about working on preparedness, advance warning, getting rid of corruption in PR, securing a stronger grid, staging support centers countrywide! Would you waste money on climate change boondoggles! Al Gore jets around pontificating and makes a fortune selling oil investments!
1601 2018-01-08 20:40:50 Times are tough- I just sprayed myself with tanning oil while I walk between classes so I catch the most sun 
1602 2018-01-08 20:40:47 45% of kids with cancer in Venezuela died last year. There's no medication, no food, all due to Venezuela having oil and being another pawn of global politics. It's no Aleppo, but kids are dying and there's no need for that.
1603 2018-01-08 20:40:45 Someone plz tell me why I just spent £19 on basically face masks and a face oil? @beautybay
1604 2018-01-08 20:40:45 The Griffin Reinhart trade was made in a time that the Edmonton Oilers brass was IN LOVE with an ex-Oilers player's kid and anyone who played for the Edmonton Oil Kings.
1605 2018-01-08 20:40:44 Go to Aesop, browse the products for a while and then tell the assistant you're interested in a face oil but aren't sure which one and they will give you lots of free samples. I had enough to last a month!
1606 2018-01-08 20:40:30 weak. you're more bootlicker than crazy snake oil peddler these days. what gives?

1610 2018-01-08 20:40:13 @TheSciBabe  only essential oil I'll use is peppermint because spiders hate the smell and I have arachnophobia
1611 2018-01-08 20:40:09 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
1612 2018-01-08 20:40:07 Mike see what Norway did...with their oil wealth..its surprising  ..richest country in the world.
1613 2018-01-08 20:40:06 Cleaned my car, changed my oil and now getting everything ready for class tomorrow. Just the kind of day I needed 
1614 2018-01-08 20:40:00 I MAY follow up with pure Shea butter or coconut oil because it’s winter, but in any other season, straight Dove works fine
1615 2018-01-08 20:39:52 Toner gets all excess oil and stuff that your wash may have missed
1616 2018-01-08 20:39:48 Oral Roberts pulled this crap on a much larger scale. Evangelical pastors are snake oil salesmen and con artists, profiting off the religious fears of the easily manipulated.
1617 2018-01-08 20:39:44 Just heard a doctor use the term "oil change" referring to the same oil change as in Blue Mountain State
1618 2018-01-08 20:39:37 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
1619 2018-01-08 20:39:25 ACTUALLY, 2005 adjusted for today's $ was more costly, point taken nevertheless. Must stop destructive oil drilling  first!

1626 2018-01-08 20:38:32 Ask them how I lead them to oil and diamonds Rare Minerals ,. How I built clothing line and food story and music and Portuguese and the higher education I did displace  and still haven't nothing fuck you and your life
1627 2018-01-08 20:38:09 Really, tell me how this helps?  It is the delays, new regulations on top of the most regulated industry?  Or is it the oil tankers floating down the St Lawrence from dirty oil countries to meet our demands.  Tell me more pls
1628 2018-01-08 20:37:57 Adrian taught me how to change my car oil together. It was so much fun. I'm willing to do/learn things about cars for him 
1629 2018-01-08 20:37:56 Is it a condition to get XLE underperforming #CL to start looking for a short oil trade ?
1630 2018-01-08 20:37:44 Some one has told me that President Trump plans to do something to the heating oil that people need to keep warm. I want to know if this is true because as of now,l dont believe he would do that,especially to poor people. Please,l need an answer.
1631 2018-01-08 20:37:27 As with anything, try it on a small area first to check for reactions, but I've not heard of anyone having them to Neem oil.
1632 2018-01-08 20:37:23 Peppermint oil saves lives 
1633 2018-01-08 20:37:15 One good thing about getting the oil changed in my car is that I get to write blog posts while I wait! #bbloggers #adulting #multitasking
1634 2018-01-08 20:37:07 So why aren’t you backing the NDP in their efforts to get pipelines built and get Alberta oil to tidewater? We’re seeing more grassroots support for pipelines than the last few decades. You’re willing to cut off your nose to spite your face.
1635 2018-01-08 20:36:58 Anyone up this late? Burning the Mid-night oil....... editing some video for tomorrow. Guys do you have any topic on which you guys want a video? Shoot them I might work on it, don't feel like sleeping.
1636 2018-01-08 20:36:56 I put a drop in a rollerball and filled the rest w/ Fractionated coconut oil. Applied to bottoms of Wyatt's feet & his tummy. Gas problems gone & he has been resting finally. Thank the Lord for my #youngliving life!!

1637 2018-01-08 20:36:55 I don’t know how I feel about using coconut oil to cook. I feel like I’m eating my body butter I use to moisturize after the shower 
1638 2018-01-08 20:36:51 Mmm settling in with a smoothie and some overwatch. Still have to get my oil changed at 3 but after that I'm gonna stream  I think I figured my setup out 
1639 2018-01-08 20:36:45 Surely there is oil under some of the golf courses in this country.

1641 2018-01-08 20:36:28 I cut the ends off them, cut them in half, put them in a bowl with some olive oil, salt, pepper, parmesan cheese, then lay them out on a cookie sheet and bake for 20 min at 400° 
1642 2018-01-08 20:36:26 It's not true going by how the economy has been in sharp decline since Q4 2014 when our GDP was 5.94 down to 2.35 in Q2 2015. so even d best of 'productive readership' you ar talking about can't diversity the economy from oil in less than 2yrs Remember crude oil was $27 Feb 2016

1650 2018-01-08 20:35:52 This is why gas costs so much at the pump. The cost of fighting lawsuits is almost equal to the cost companies pay to obtain and refine oil. 

Your selfish crusades also keep oil companies from spending more on new procedures and equipment to reduce oil spills.
1651 2018-01-08 20:35:41 Just know that: Option A
You owe me 2 plates (Breakfast and Dinner) of peppered oil rice with better bonga fish, smoked fish and chilled bottle of coke.
Option B
Bole, Sauce and roasted fish plus a bottle of chilled coke.

So what's it gonna Be?

1659 2018-01-08 20:34:44 Its all about oil and the derrick on the Far Du Lac Lake.
1660 2018-01-08 20:34:44 Senator Harris does not need to provide information. It's bad policy, like offshore oil drilling during a time of glut, falling prices & rising CO2 levels. Like eliminating deductions for college contributions. There's little to zero thought behind what these people are doing.
1661 2018-01-08 20:34:43 XLE certainly not underperforming oil yet. Not what id want to see if I was short...
1662 2018-01-08 20:34:40 Also, answers: 1/ Few recipes like our famous Brown Sugar Salmon have sugar. Otherwise, meals = no added sugar. Important health benefit of Gobble is you add your own salt, pepper, sugar, oil, etc. Herb butters come separate so you can use all, half or none. Spice is separate too

1666 2018-01-08 20:34:26 Before reading the whole tweet, I thought you had an app that allowed you to frack for oil & was v concerned
1667 2018-01-08 20:34:18 My son had it really bad, he tried everything, then we tried the Neem oil and it really made a huge difference. Has to be the pure stuff though.

1672 2018-01-08 20:33:27 The things that can be harmed is worth more than their money can buy.  Just say NO, Just say Hell NO!  Oil companies do not pay for the damage they do.  We do!

1674 2018-01-08 20:33:25 Oil is not on land its in UK Territory waters.  A bit like the falklands ;)
1675 2018-01-08 20:33:09 That might work, too, if it has the same texture as raw sweet potato? Once DF and I made the ham & yam with shredded carrots and it turned out pretty well.
Do you ever roast the squash at high temps? Cubed, and tossed with olive oil & salt? I do that w/ other root veggies.

1680 2018-01-08 20:32:29 People wearing Native American headdresses to a festival owned by a dude who successfully fought to drill for oil on Native American land is just so peak ignorant American

1682 2018-01-08 20:32:15 What, are you some sort of snake oil salesman, pawning your reptilian wares?
1683 2018-01-08 20:31:41 Car shop called me after taking my car to get new tires (they only had 76,000 miles on them) and “goes your a mess you need a oil change, new air filters and new wind shield wipers because they are falling apart”  but joke is on them because I already knew I was a mess
1684 2018-01-08 20:31:41 My daughter can’t have oil of any kind so we use parchment paper for everything! So thankful for something so simple. :-)
1685 2018-01-08 20:31:38 Bruta! El gas oil subió para todos, o a las cosechadoras le echan jugo de naranja?
Urgente retenciones a la exportación de pera, así estan igual que los sojeros
1686 2018-01-08 20:31:20 For Christmas I received #TATCHA “Polished,” a “classic rice enzyme cleaner” as a gift. I actually LOVE it. It seems to be the perfect exfolient for me. I like combining it with TATCHA “Pure,” a “one step camellia cleaning oil” (another gift). Leaves my skin so smooth & soft!

   Again was he leaning down to kiss his back softly. 

Moving his hands then again down his boyfriends back before he was moving off him.
   Laying in the bed next to him then.
1693 2018-01-08 20:30:45 I only put a little bit of olive oil in my salad. Dressings have alot of calories.

1702 2018-01-08 20:30:01 Distracted by trying to write my dissertation? 

Just got out of shower, dressed, and applied oil to hair before realising I hadn't rinsed out the conditioner. 

Soooo....maybe a little?
1703 2018-01-08 20:29:57 Try neem oil. It's antibacterial, worked for my son. If you can't find any of the pure stuff, let me know and I will see if my daughter has any, she used to sell it before she got unwell.
1704 2018-01-08 20:29:51 Dear Frances Mayes. A Cortona, dove posso trovare il Bramasole Olive Oil? grazie
1705 2018-01-08 20:29:49 In 2018 mom and pop establishments should stop using cheap sesame seed buns (of course I’m allregic and had to mutilate my boca burger) AND there’s no excuse for usng old oil to cook fries. 

On top of that I ordered the same thing for my mom and now feel bad about it.

The destroying off our national Parks and now the possible destruction of our costs for oil that will be exported to China. For God's sake !an pull your head out and look at what he is doing
1710 2018-01-08 20:29:26 No my friend, I’m saying the NDP hates everything about oil and gas, yet take credit for a rebounding economy when it was the oil and gas sector driving the growth.
1711 2018-01-08 20:29:21 Yes. Also, what do you think about CBC oil?
1712 2018-01-08 20:29:07 Never use Rymes Propane and Oil. The are the worst! #epicfail

1715 2018-01-08 20:28:46 LMK how it works. Good luck!!

(ps - if you haven’t made mayo before wait to add the infused liquid til the end so you don’t waste it if the emulsion fails...I was halfway dying the first half of the oil or so and it worked but it’s super easy to oops a mayo, unfortunately.)
1716 2018-01-08 20:28:25 That was our oil money
1717 2018-01-08 20:28:19 WOW! Venezuela us about to be a bug headhunt in the Oil & Crypto currency game!
100 million PETROS coming soon!
1718 2018-01-08 20:28:14 So if your poorly run operation causes an oil spill it’ll also be his fault, as well? This shows how depraved and deluded the left has become: that it’s totally okay to drill for oil as long as you’re doing it out of spite of trump
1719 2018-01-08 20:27:52 Nesse nível, só mesmo sangue de Jesus com coconut oil

1722 2018-01-08 20:26:31 Apparently, he thinks the price of oil hit 15 year lows around the world because Alberta voted in the NDP I wouldn't waste any more time arguing with the guy, he wouldn't know a fact if it bit him in the ass. All he knows is Kenney's "alternate facts.
1723 2018-01-08 20:26:28 Issa half seriously said fellow Republicans Rohrabacher & King had 2b on Putin’s payroll. 2014 Oil has been the common factor w Russia since Ron Paul of Texas saluted Putin over his own President yrs ago. Yrs ahead of Mueller & you. Hope I’m absolutely wrong.

1728 2018-01-08 20:25:55 You’re calling it over 60,000 lost jobs in the energy sector. Now, that was the original job losses during the downturn. Are you accounting for the fact that the majority of those jobs have returned as Oil prices regained strength and alternative energy has started to employ...
1729 2018-01-08 20:25:53 The environment warrior who wanted to shut down Keystone so his competeing oil pipeline could get top billing?
1730 2018-01-08 20:25:44 My favorite thing about going to the oil change place is hearing about all the shit that is wrong with my car that I didn’t know about.

1733 2018-01-08 20:25:30 Why do you keep lying to the American people. The @GOP has gutted all tax incentives for wind and solar energy and opened our national parks to be destroyed by oil drilling corporate donors to the Republican Party. God I hope Wisconsin voters get rid of you in 2018.

1735 2018-01-08 20:25:09 So what the article should have read as Iran a country with one of the largest oil reserves in the world is being too cheap to subsidize their farmers and women have no rights... spin spin spin @SCIAM should be spelled @ISCAM lol
1736 2018-01-08 20:25:06 So fracking and drilling for oil is fine so long as you’re doing it for anti-trump purposes?

Liberalism really is a mental disorder
1737 2018-01-08 20:24:58 Jimmy didn't fail. He was sabotaged by corrupt DC, corporate media, big oil & the military industrial complex.

1745 2018-01-08 20:23:50 The NDP is moving AB forward in the 21st century instead of the regressive, oppressive 19th century that Kenney wants. You know repealing our CLP and Ctax would virtually destroy our oil industry and investment in AB?
1746 2018-01-08 20:23:42 Honey it's ok, he doesn't last that long.

1773 2018-01-08 20:20:24 Skin care doesn’t have to be expensive. Olive oil & brown sugar is a cheap exfoliant.  Witch hazel for a toner is $2. Black soap is $10 for an entire pound on Amazon. You can keep your skin on fleek all year for under $20!

1799 2018-01-08 20:16:07 @MassGovernor  As a consumer and in need of home heating oil what do we do when your oil company will not answer the phone or email orders #help
1800 2018-01-08 20:16:00 We should not only block the plans, we should deny all harbors and services to any vessel which supports the endeavor (barring emergencies of course).

Deny access to ports. Deny the rights to build any on-shore infrastructure for collecting, transporting, or processing the oil.
1801 2018-01-08 20:15:41 Yeah the oil is actually owned by the UK as it’s off their coast but hey if you believe for a second that the rUK are going to have it back then good luck with that one lol

1805 2018-01-08 20:15:11 You mean the so called 'scientists' aka shills paid by oil companies to spread propaganda to protect their golden egg goose that is black gold, oil. They don't care to spread bs if is to protect their business since they are afraid of a new industrial revolution, green technology

1807 2018-01-08 20:14:52 There’s a section of my book The Looting Machine on how this racket works, drawn from interviews with some of those involved. True that officials play a role - as do some in the oil companies

1809 2018-01-08 20:14:38 It would probably last a little longer if I put in some rosemary oil to preserve it but this will parish quickly w/only the tiny bit vinegar in it to help it.

1828 2018-01-08 20:12:47 Just another reason to stay away from Texas. Racists & misogynists abound among all those good Christian gun-Toting cowboys & oil tycoons.

1830 2018-01-08 20:12:45 Report: Saudi Arabia deficit reaches $32.4bn – Middle East Monitor do u know why. I worked in Saudi Arabia> Reason: they are running out of OIL.
1831 2018-01-08 20:12:40 I meaaaan, the faster we use up oil, the faster well need to invest in alternative energy? :T
1832 2018-01-08 20:12:36 As is Peppermint oil!
1833 2018-01-08 20:12:25 Most states don’t allow dispensaries to sell anything with alcohol in them in that high of percentages.

If I got it from a dispensary it would be in oil not alcohol likely, so I would sub it for part of the oil instead of lemon juice.

Just for reference (in case you try :)
1834 2018-01-08 20:12:17 I can point to major oil companies constructing and building wind farms for nothing more than carbon credits then seeking back to their own oil refineries for major profit.. then letting them@just sit idle and run down. BP and Shell oil are the worst at this
1835 2018-01-08 20:12:02 Yo don't all forget that Oprah peddled snake oil and gave a platform to and legitimized people like Jenny McCarthy to millions of dumb motherfuckers everywhere, thereby actively making the world worse.

1840 2018-01-08 20:11:09 @WTI_n_NG, Jimboman is talking about the reality of oil, not what Saudi Arabia wants. Saudi Arabia want to rule the entire middle east without Hezbollah or Iran getting in their way. Is the middle east completely in the hands of Saudi Arabia? No. So SA's wants isn't relevant.
1841 2018-01-08 20:11:00 3 oil changes in a few months means too much driving

1858 2018-01-08 20:08:55 .@FarmBureau Please note that most, if not all, that @realDonaldTrump will say to you will be lies or, at best, have a very tenuous connection with the truth. Do not buy into his snake oil.
1859 2018-01-08 20:08:54 the oil industry would lose out if we used paper ,plastic bags contain oil! 
they are forcing supermarkets to use oil. mystery solved
1860 2018-01-08 20:08:43 The SEC requieres that oil be profitable under existing cost conditions. PDVSA reserves don't meet SEC standards @morandavid

1865 2018-01-08 20:08:06 Why we are not using insurance companies to mitigate social risks? Want gun violence decreased? Require the owner to carry insurance. Minimize oil spills? Require companies to carry policies with 100% coverage. The insurers will manage the risk because they have #skininthegame.
1866 2018-01-08 20:07:52 I know, right? My 401 k looks great, my paycheck is fatter by 3%, my brother-in-law is finally back to work in the oil field & my godchild doesn't have to pay O-Care mandate anymore. Yeah, Trumps nuts. Lololololol .

1868 2018-01-08 20:07:43 That’s super!  When are you guys going to look at Zion Oil, $ZN?  It’s a publicly traded fraud that requests investors to “pray” that they strike oil in Israel some day.

1874 2018-01-08 20:07:06 If I had infused oil on hand I would have made it with that but all I have is ghee, coconut oil, or tincture so that was the best option.

If you make it with cannaoil you could leave the recipe the way it is ;)
1875 2018-01-08 20:07:00 The "most successful snake oil salesman in history" is not at all congruent with Oprah IMO. Yeah, not crazy about Dr. Phil or even her as a candidate but I think ur tweet is below the belt considering the cards she got dealt in life.
1876 2018-01-08 20:06:59 When you don’t see your husband a lot. The only time you get to see him is when you sit and watch him change the oil on both cars 
1877 2018-01-08 20:06:55 Yeah,  but how do they get it in there, and if it is put in there synthetically, why do they call it "olive oil"?
1878 2018-01-08 20:06:45 California will not tolerate off shore drilling.  So, gut rich oil companies,---take your oil spills to other beaches.  Stay away from California.

1881 2018-01-08 20:06:33 But then you wouldn't have oil for free.
1882 2018-01-08 20:06:05 Please don’t forget this recent tax bill removed the fees the oil companies pay to clean up spills.
1883 2018-01-08 20:06:01 How often are you washing and conditioning it? Do you keep it moisturizered with oil?

1921 2018-01-08 20:01:16 Trump admin leasing seaboards and #ArcticRefuge is not negotiable. Don't we already have enough oil rigs off the west coast?  Little evidence that there is any oil of consequence on east coast. Arctic is off-limits!
1922 2018-01-08 20:01:14 Mossadeq, the Shah of Iran’s right-hand military man, righteously slapped the face of the British when he nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). When the British punished Iran for this resistance, it encouraged Communists to raise their voices.

1932 2018-01-08 20:00:22 To begin the seal installation, an important step is to pre-lubricate the seal with the oil or grease you are going to seal. This will reduce the “sliding“ friction force that can damage the seal when installed dry.

1937 2018-01-08 20:00:08 Trump will destroy our planet. Oil spills and increase in CO2 output will occur in America. Plastics in oceans, cancer increases, more extinctions. But Coal and oil will thrive. Income gap will grow and poverty will rise. Thanks Trump for ruining our country and planet.

1941 2018-01-08 19:59:36 Trump WH palace intrigue is juicy, but detracts attention from real policy decisions:

-Pakistan military aid suspension

-Plan to open most US coastal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling

-Ending protective status for some 200,000 people from El Salvador in 2019
1942 2018-01-08 19:59:23 I CALLED and scheduled an OIL CHANGE like an ADULT  why is functioning so hard lmao
1943 2018-01-08 19:59:17 i see her hair in the back was like My boys head.. That good hair. I used organic cocnut oil on his head because when he was journey age it thinned out due to him always laying on it.
1944 2018-01-08 19:59:16 I've watched 3 episodes of Planet Earth while waiting for my oil change. My car better fly after this.
1945 2018-01-08 19:59:10 Thank you! Yes, I use oil but my underpainting is acrylic.
1946 2018-01-08 19:58:47 Point was US economy is booming so CANADA is benefiting.  Name one economic policy Trudeau has implemented?   $60 oil is also helping out.
1947 2018-01-08 19:58:43 Dying to short oil but I'd like to see one big red DWT flush to low 11s.  I still remember when oil ran STRAIGHT down for days on end.  It can go straight up too.  So must manage that risk.
1948 2018-01-08 19:58:26 & palm oil is used in a lot of processed human food. One of the main ingredients in Nutella
1949 2018-01-08 19:58:25 SA wants Aramco IPO out before they leave oil to market forces.
1950 2018-01-08 19:58:25 Not likely.  Some fat-cat told Trump he really wanted to look for oil in your waters. Trump, wanting to look like a big shot, told him "no problem", will open up all the coastal waters. Trump can't go back and disappoint the guy now.
1951 2018-01-08 19:58:02 olive oil
1952 2018-01-08 19:57:39 Heck no just added spurilina to my hair mask and avocado oil works wonders wow...scared me for a second tho!
1953 2018-01-08 19:57:32 I made an appointment for my oil change and still have been waiting for an hour...
1954 2018-01-08 19:56:52 I loved it today.Hina n Vikas were shown their place.And I think today more oil was added to the burning jealousy of these three loosers.
1955 2018-01-08 19:56:37 ...not much protein either the poor buggers. No wonder they rightly screwed...loads of digestible carb and seed oil. Boom. 
1956 2018-01-08 19:56:36 None of that would be improved by an oil spill, but thanks for playing.
1957 2018-01-08 19:56:28 Hello @FineNCountry when are you guys shifting investments to ph? There's a gold mine here for real estate firms here with the amount of oil workers who have the funds.
1958 2018-01-08 19:56:20 Prostrate Cancer "Mitt Romney"
Hello!? HEMP OIL treatment. Google : Tommy Chong (yes that Tommy Chong) and cancer. You will be amazed.
1959 2018-01-08 19:56:18 DRIP 8.94 new low projection.  We'll see.  I think GUSH will be YUUUUUUGE next few years but we need a big market wack and oil services will get hammered at these levels IF oil pulls at same time.
1960 2018-01-08 19:56:09 I think it works better in an oil, not moisturizer :(
1961 2018-01-08 19:56:02 النت اليووم ضعيف مره
1962 2018-01-08 19:55:54 Why do I feel like nails cost more than an oil change? 
1963 2018-01-08 19:55:53 Yes please!  My three kids are looking forward to seeing him play at Lucas Oil AGAIN all in their PSU #26 jerseys. 45 min from us!!!!
1964 2018-01-08 19:55:51 Tea tree oil?
1965 2018-01-08 19:55:48 Those chili oil beans are great!
1966 2018-01-08 19:55:42 Rain! So rare in LA, it's like striking oil or finding a pot of gold. Grateful for the nourishment for the earth.
1967 2018-01-08 19:55:21 Ain’t nothin’ slick to a can of oil 
1968 2018-01-08 19:55:19 Seems that oil bulls have finally found $DNOW
1969 2018-01-08 19:55:05 All true.  I wouldn't rule her out.  But over the years she has a lot of snake oil promotion to account for.
1970 2018-01-08 19:55:05 I like my face to look greasy  Idky maybe bc when i was younger my mom always had me greased down w. baby oil
1971 2018-01-08 19:55:00 "Am I ignitable? God deliver me from the dread asbestos of ‘other things’. Saturate me with the oil of the Spirit that I may be a flame." —
 Jim Elliot
1972 2018-01-08 19:54:43 I thought I was safe because any kind of oil makes my face go haywire and none of the luxury stuff is oil-free but.......... it's been 3 days and no face volcanoes, fuck
1973 2018-01-08 19:54:39 Isn't Gove pro fracking? Seems odd for someone looking after our environment? Or is it that his mate Rupert Murdoch sits on the board of a shale oil & gas company Genie Energy?
1974 2018-01-08 19:54:34 I was told olive oil works better... removes the fake ones and leaves your lashes intact
1975 2018-01-08 19:54:29 If it wasn’t raining and cold I’d change my oil myself
1976 2018-01-08 19:53:53 The Jaguars allowed 3 points yesterday, and @criscarter80 says the Defense is "leaking oil". LOL
1977 2018-01-08 19:53:47 Trump is only for Iran so he can help Saudi Arabia and Russia sell more oil
1978 2018-01-08 19:53:43 Rosehip oil is the main one
1979 2018-01-08 19:53:38 That is the point isn't it? Why would OPEC/KSA be waging a war with U.S. tight oil when its total growth is 22% of OPEC's production cut? Why do people believe this crap? Pure American hubris.
1980 2018-01-08 19:53:34 remember when oprah endorsed doctor oz and thusly created pseudoscientific daytime health talk shows designed to sell you snake oil
1981 2018-01-08 19:53:34 
1982 2018-01-08 19:53:28 Shorted oil today-pullback to mid fifties. PM/Miners nothing to really trade this yr and next as they blast off. Selling calls and putspreads for premium other than that enjoy massive price appreciation
1983 2018-01-08 19:53:20 Many reasons why the price of oil will continue to rise - geo-politics, high demand, #Aramco float later in the year, rising tensions in #Iran, #Saudi want high #oil_price and strong global economy.
1984 2018-01-08 19:53:19 If you weren't such a coward you would come to CA  you know the state that you want to open up to more offshore oil drilling.  Why don't you come here and explain yourself Boy.  Or would you rather just shit on the States that didn't vote for you. #TraitorTrump #25thAmendmentNow
1985 2018-01-08 19:53:14 Normal practice I'm afraid especially with US companies. Not many could afford to buy us outright, unless they happen to own a few oil wells 
1986 2018-01-08 19:53:05 Two fine and one's had a bit of a mishap. See last Tweet. Seems to have fallen in a drum of oil 
1987 2018-01-08 19:52:55 Also need to buy essential oils. Did an essential oil treatment two weeks ago in MD and my face never felt like that. I was in shock
1988 2018-01-08 19:52:48 Remember I tweeted about using coconut oil on my skin ? Ya never again. I had an allergic reaction 
1989 2018-01-08 19:52:47 Exactly, when a strain is set to be released and doesn't, coincidentally there's a new oil shortly after! Or so I found with the first unicorn at least.
1990 2018-01-08 19:52:42 It will be unlivable as a modern society once the oil runs out. .
1991 2018-01-08 19:52:29 Venezuelan dictator pumped 6 billion dollars of oil revenue into bitcoin. Will that also e excluded from bitcoins pump bonanza?
1992 2018-01-08 19:52:27 Got another Full Fat Modified Butter Spread for you...Wait for it. Lol!
This one is declared SMOOTH Full Fat Modified Butter Spread!
Product of South Africa. Alas > USDA Nutrional Declaration! ONLY Sat Fats % content declared. NO MUFA or PUFA content declared for Veg Oil. WHAT?
1993 2018-01-08 19:52:26 I should get the oil sha, so I can finally lock a babe. I can’t finish 2018 single.
1994 2018-01-08 19:52:24 And the crowning glory will be McDavid for Subban
1995 2018-01-08 19:51:55 Wat about coconut oil that's what I use
1996 2018-01-08 19:51:39 Four whole dollars?! Whoa! And how much are your big oil pals benefiting from the tax scam?
1997 2018-01-08 19:51:32 You anoint my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life
1998 2018-01-08 19:51:20 Shea butter and coconut oil for face & @Crest for teeth lol
1999 2018-01-08 19:50:48 Or....they just make oil 
2000 2018-01-08 19:50:47 When the guy at the oil change place asks to add you on snap lol 
2001 2018-01-08 19:50:38 Looking like some cat wey edey sick seriously wey some alo wanna be veterinarian put palm oil for ein mouth make eno die. Stress.
2002 2018-01-08 19:50:38 I love people watching when I get my oil changed.  I could be a professional people watcher.
2003 2018-01-08 19:50:34 I did a mushroom pasta with garlic, onion, herbs, parmesan and oil, salt. YUM!
2004 2018-01-08 19:50:23 For sure. I am mostly horrified by what I do know about Oprah. Her promotion of dangerous quacks like Jenny McCarthy, Dr. Oz, Dr, Phil and a whole pile of huckster "psychics" So either she is a gullible turd or she doesn't care if she makes money off of snake oil. Gross.
2005 2018-01-08 19:50:17 I need to oil my braids when I get home
2006 2018-01-08 19:50:12 #Oil_prices move closer to $70.
2007 2018-01-08 19:50:10 I applied tea tree oil every other night and use a green tea toner
2008 2018-01-08 19:50:08 the latter two are vvv affordable as well. I loooove angel veil it feels so smooth and because it’s oil free it doesn’t feel greasy at all
2009 2018-01-08 19:50:05 Low oil price led us to recession. I agree with that but there are measures a productive leadership would have done to prevent that.
2010 2018-01-08 19:50:05 We're about to open offshore drilling around the whole country. Oil prices will drop and it will be worth nothing.
2011 2018-01-08 19:49:44 Also loving the #DIY Rosemary & fenugreek hair mist and fenugreek oil  I made over the weekend. Tingling scalp and all plus it softens hair and adds shine. Yaaasssss!!! Let's see what it does for length. 
2012 2018-01-08 19:49:43 @PetroHome so.....no heat for two days now my oil company (yes you Petro) has disconnected their phones!!!  You try and call and you get a message (the telephone number you are trying to reach....). 

Cowardly behavior.  Let’s hope you don’t kill somebody on your watch! #coldNJ
2013 2018-01-08 19:49:42 Nigga I should’ve just changed my own damn oil these mfs takin forever
2014 2018-01-08 19:49:40 But they say data is new oil and people will eventually ask for it.
2015 2018-01-08 19:49:36 Try tea tree oil and lemon brightening serum from Corium
2016 2018-01-08 19:49:32 neck oil! nice!
2017 2018-01-08 19:49:30 Are Chelsea not an oil club?

2020 2018-01-08 19:49:22 Oh they certainly have trivia, silly contests, and a photo booth at the @SanDiegoAirport gate. I will just spray myself with thieves oil, sitting in my corner avoiding the crowd. I witnessed the flu take down the family 1x1... #SouthwestAirlines #biztravel #fluseason

2022 2018-01-08 19:49:20 Does anyone know how to shake depression off? Is there like some sort of oil or tea
2023 2018-01-08 19:49:13 Currently getting my oil changed and inspection sticker (that’s a year and a half overdue) because Casens dad said I can’t come back without a receipt proving that I did so  I need more people like him in my life to keep me on track

2028 2018-01-08 19:49:00 And they might, with Havertz. The point being that the strategy has yielded enough cash to improve the team with 3 world class players rather than 1. There’s no other feasible strategy to combat oil clubs
2029 2018-01-08 19:48:46 Even Stephen Harper, a Conservative from the Oil Patch for Pete's sake, bought into the scam. Conservatives should learn from situation in USA.
2030 2018-01-08 19:48:43 Why don't you believe them? What do they have to gain? The evidence is stacked against you I'm afraid. You worried about your car/coal/gas/oil?
2031 2018-01-08 19:48:40 Hated walking round work with greasy hair today put serum on last night and legit looked like a had dipped me hair in jaz and jays chip oil 
2032 2018-01-08 19:48:33 @PeterSchiff you’re betting on oil prices going up despite the natural deflation and forever falling production costs, admittedly I have no faith in fiat at this stage, but do you genuinely think think enough money has been dumped into the system achieve $100 a barrel?
2033 2018-01-08 19:48:22 oil perking up, watch out for the ramp to new 52w highs on new news
2034 2018-01-08 19:48:19 This bath oil can make me stay in the bath for 6 hours

2037 2018-01-08 19:48:03 Yes imagine. Millions of innocent lives saved. Countries able to use their own currency instead of the Petrodollar. Millions wouldn't be displaced. But hey, America gets a load more oil and their weapons manufacturers are happy.
2038 2018-01-08 19:47:55 Benefit porefessional, NYX angel veil (oil free), touch in sol no poreblem primer
2039 2018-01-08 19:47:45 Would take something stronger than olive oil to make me wear those pants.
2040 2018-01-08 19:47:34 @VickiMarble says she has never received a contribution from Extraction or from any oil and gas company or employee; only donation was $100 from Colorado Petroleum Assn in 2012. #coleg @colo_politics

2046 2018-01-08 19:46:51 ...but voted to gut the environmental protections for water and air and money for oil spill cleanups.  That should help the Mississippi River.  Party over Country.

2052 2018-01-08 19:45:37 I got you! I use Nubian Heritage’s Indian Hemp & Haitian Vetiver soap as a face wash. peppermint oil, vegetable glycerin, & rosewater as a toner after washing, and rosehip seed oil as my moisturizer. That’s it lol.

What a disappointment and waste of time this has been! Worse still, freeze for another night!

#fail #ecommerce
2059 2018-01-08 19:45:08 I Did that the first few days but I rather enjoy going to class and my auditions plus I've had appts you make and my oil change this week. Must get done! Hehe
2060 2018-01-08 19:45:02 Lamps are not effective without oil.. Christians are not effective without His Spirit..
2061 2018-01-08 19:44:59 But quite willing to consume oil sourced from other countries.

That's hypocrisy.
2062 2018-01-08 19:44:57 Reasons why Californians freak out about rain
It ligit never rains here
Turns the streets into oil slicks
After big fires, there's a high chance of mudslides which can be extremely dangerous
2063 2018-01-08 19:44:50 Some girls cut their hair to reinvent themselves after they go through some turbulance. Amateurs. I'm changing my hair, eye color, name, phone number, address, social habits and my outlook on life. And I need an oil change. I'm going all out, y'all.
2064 2018-01-08 19:44:48 That's fair. The wildlife down there has had it too easy for far too long. Swimming and flying around in their own little slice of paradise like they're too cool for school (fish pun. yw). A few catastrophic oil spills will sort them out quick. 
2065 2018-01-08 19:44:46 That's all he does, his voice/tone is like a car's transmission that ran out of oil.
2066 2018-01-08 19:44:42 @MarthaStewart Hi Martha, Do you have a favourite olive oil?
2067 2018-01-08 19:44:36 When you wanna curl up and sleep but you gotta get an oil change and do other grown up stuff
2068 2018-01-08 19:44:33 Ufo oil
2069 2018-01-08 19:44:31 Oil-free meals will be identified with a red toothpick so the guest will be sure about what they are served. Fruit will be served at the ice cream event and we are trying our best to include oil free pizza for the pizza party.

2071 2018-01-08 19:44:07 Middle of June 2017 oil was trading at $42.  Everybody put potential cap at $52.00. They managed to take WTI above $62.00 and Brend above $68.00.   They moved the barrels around and got US inventory down.  Gave the market the impression supply is not meeting the demand.
2072 2018-01-08 19:44:07 Hate waitin on oil changes
2073 2018-01-08 19:44:07 Try blotting sheets or moisturizer with oil control as well as fenty foundation is gonna be a blessing to u for a Matte look I promise
2074 2018-01-08 19:43:58 Yes wasu sun samu alert yaw,we r trying to see how the others will get,at the mean time they should remain calm
2075 2018-01-08 19:43:33 Mine does this too! I started using a cleansing oil at night. Mornings if my skins feels tight. DHC is a great brand but expensive. Currently using Simple. Cutting down on soap helped. Also using cream by CerVe. Cetaphil is great too! Oil of Olay didn't help me at all.
2076 2018-01-08 19:43:21 I’m going to have a melt down soon. I don’t want these traitors or this Snake Oil Salesman to get away with it.  #NoCoverUp #TrumpRussia #LiarinChief  DunceTrump

2078 2018-01-08 19:42:56 You should cause you need to get an oil change every 3,000 miles and get regular tune ups
2079 2018-01-08 19:42:55 instead of getting my oil changed and getting my tire fixed, I got clothes. nailing this life thing :)
2080 2018-01-08 19:42:33 I know, everyone is giving me recipe ideas lol. Most involve salt/pepper/oil, and that's mostly what I've been doing. I've just hated them with a blazing passion since I was a kid, and they've never changed for me.
2081 2018-01-08 19:42:32 I feel like i just lost my man card dropping @_saraheller car off at pepboys for an oil change....

2085 2018-01-08 19:42:23 Seriously. Way to ruin my MSNBC listening with that snake oil salesman.
2086 2018-01-08 19:42:23 Senator why haven't you held Trump accountable for not in acting the Russian Sanctions the House's did on them? U can't stabilize iran/an let Russia get away with doing what Iran is Doing!Russians delivered N.K 1,600 Ton of oil!Be a Responsible Senator "EQUALLY""HONESTLY" to ALL!

2093 2018-01-08 19:41:52 Dislike going for oil changes cause it’s always sumn extra I find out I got to do smh
2094 2018-01-08 19:41:49 My point, awkwardly made perhaps, is that the article implies that the world cannot shift away from oil, which is an overstatement. Better to say that until that shift occurs, the world will not burn less oil due to Cda's failure to build pipelines.

2121 2018-01-08 19:38:27 I actually toss them in oil, roast them in the oven with bacon strips underneath, and then service with vietnamese dressing and rice krispy treats on top, but YMMV.
2122 2018-01-08 19:38:24 Yes, just started this month #FingersCrossed 

I ate great, worked out high intensity 50 minutes a day doing T25 and took acv and vitamins including fish oil. I reached goal in 3 months. I stopped cause I got sick but I would’ve continued to build muscle
2123 2018-01-08 19:38:15 I'm not the one who thinks climate change is a massive conspiracy created by China to steal money from the US because the big oil company sponsored republicans told me. Try taking off the tinfoil hat Reyn
2124 2018-01-08 19:37:56 State waters end at 3 miles offshore. Most of the oil platforms are already in Federal waters. This bill is Just another attempt at taking more money from public schools and fire and police. We should be taking that tax money.
2125 2018-01-08 19:37:37 Now the whole "Blood for Oil" thing makes sense!!!
2126 2018-01-08 19:37:36 Respectfully...we are saying the same thing. Until world consumption shifts from oil to other substitutes, Canada is being denied access to valuable markets. Pipeline opponents mistakenly believe that if we don't build pipes, the world will burn less oil.

2129 2018-01-08 19:37:27 Rather than paying attention to my mileage, I usually change my oil based on the amount of anxiety I have when I start thinking about how long it's been since I changed it last.
2130 2018-01-08 19:37:25 Well shit. Next, they’ll ship crude oil to the mideast & seed clouds over rainforests & to top everything they’ll be aiming lasers at the sun. Can they be stopped!?
2131 2018-01-08 19:37:17 We can't use the oil we have. Why would we annex a whole other country, to not use theirs?
2132 2018-01-08 19:37:17 Back in the late 90s I saw Gwynne Dyer give a talk about climate change and peak oil and the stability and safety of nation states.
He said that the UK had determined it would still be self-sustainable under climate change but would have to defend itself as "Battleship England"

2145 2018-01-08 19:35:27 Your article is 9 months old. As pointed out, foreign companies typically divest when oil price have decreased and Canadian companies investment offsets these divestments, which leaves all the money in AB. Suncor CEO using "exodus" implies money is leaving AB when it's not
2146 2018-01-08 19:35:27 Starting to see an increase in the "inflation in just around the corner" stories .. which will no doubt be supported if oil tests $70 and beyond. 
But there's a difference between inflation and relative price rises in energy/food.
We may get the latter, we won't get the former

2157 2018-01-08 19:33:46 Coconut oil is great for around the eyes, and any stubborn liquid lipsticks, but not the entire face. I recommend just double cleansing to remove your makeup and use a toner to entirely remove any debris.

2192 2018-01-08 19:30:10 In the last 2 decades the average price of oil per barrel is less than $60 by a margin, so if that is lean to you, then.....
2193 2018-01-08 19:30:03 They are vegan. But they contain non-sustainable palm oil. Unless they have changed recipe recently, this is destroying the rain forest and killing animals...
2194 2018-01-08 19:29:56 The best cooking fat to use is coconut oil. It is rich in fats called medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). These fats are more fulfilling than others and can boost metabolism slightly

2197 2018-01-08 19:29:12 Respectfully, you are wrong. Canadian oil producers’ lack of international market (ocean) access means that consumers around the world can’t buy Canadian oil, whether they want to or not. We are captive to one market - the U.S.; that’s where almost all our export pipelines go.
2198 2018-01-08 19:29:11 No doubt that's the shadow of 2 giant olive oil amphorae from Baetica (Dressel 20) built there by alien gourmets

2203 2018-01-08 19:28:26 Top tip:

2206 2018-01-08 19:28:05 I thought my boss was kidding when he said we ran out of oil and didn’t get a delivery. It’s 20 degrees outside.
2207 2018-01-08 19:28:00 ‘They had seventeen years to apply for permanent status’ you said, despite that being impossible. Then you criticized them for not doing something the law prevents them from doing.
2208 2018-01-08 19:27:59 First of all honey is gonna make it too light , our go to is coconut oil, okay so what we gonna do is sugar and coconut oil! Then teeth brush with turmeric, anti inflammatory already on it so you can tooth brush lips then repeat with sugar& organic olive oil
2209 2018-01-08 19:27:56 I'm hoping to get them back up north for a replay in the cauldron of the Crown Oil Arena.
2210 2018-01-08 19:27:46 as for salad maybe add some nuts or find a yogurt based dressing, fats are needed to sustain hunger...even olive oil & vinegar helps and is simple. whole grain crackers or toast can help too. added protein can come from chickpeas or kidney beans.
2211 2018-01-08 19:27:46 The benefit is that adding healthy fat slows the effect of the caffeine, preventing that energy spike. You can add MCT Oil to smoothies, and cook with coconut oil that has MCT -  you should aim for more healthy fats (avocado, nuts, seed etc) than carbs in your regular diet!
2212 2018-01-08 19:27:43 You look gorgeous but I need the name of the oil and shaving products you use on them legs cause BABY!! LONG AND SLENDER!!!

2216 2018-01-08 19:27:10 When you're right, you're right. I need more oil in my life anyways, like who even needs clean air anymore?!
2217 2018-01-08 19:26:52 i hate burns so much, when i used to work at this donut shop I had to work for two people because my coworker came in too tired to work, block of oil slipped out of my hands while i was filling the fryer, burnt most of my wrist
2218 2018-01-08 19:26:44 I'm starting this tomorrow morning. I've heard so many good things about MCT oil so I'm pretty pumped.
2219 2018-01-08 19:26:41 Tar Sands oil costs far more to produce. When the price drops to $35 a barrel they are losing millions a day. No company would continue in that business. Thousands of small energy companies went tits up as well.
2220 2018-01-08 19:26:31 Simple oil of cloves...
2221 2018-01-08 19:26:31 Great but they are planning on drilling for more oil in the artic.
2222 2018-01-08 19:26:26 So far I’ve gone to class. Scheduled both a dentist and oil appointment, gotten notes ready for class tomorrow, and work at 4. It’s a productive ass Monday.

2241 2018-01-08 19:23:47 I understood some of those words.

What are the benefits of MCT Oil and grass fed butter. I don't drink coffee so how would I go about putting those things into my body otherwise?
2242 2018-01-08 19:23:33 Please, Germany, help me!! Are you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???

2249 2018-01-08 19:22:44 What seems obviously unforgivable Is  if PMB admin fails to repair old & build new refineries for Nig, he repeatedly emphasized how experienced he is in the oil industry while campaigning, beside, it's under  that promise some casted their votes for him!
2250 2018-01-08 19:22:34 I need a new tire, oil change, and new tags...owning a car sucks sometimes
2251 2018-01-08 19:22:33 This also works as a temp measure. Also they don't like peppermint oil (not essence)

2255 2018-01-08 19:22:04 One of my favourite things I've learned at @Onnit is adding 1T of MCT Oil and 1T of grass fed butter to my coffee. I've cut down from 5+ to 2 cups of coffee a day and my energy levels are WAY more balanced  @OnnitAcademy
2256 2018-01-08 19:22:01 Yes.... for sure.. it’s not just about eating leaves and seeds tho. Extensive research including the pharmas have been into this.. to the point that the greedy bastards are now putting money into c oil...  I have two friends currently with cancer and are self curing.

2287 2018-01-08 19:17:45 But we already know how NG generators will respond to pay for performance—by investing in dual fuel (oil) capability, not firm pipeline capacity—so the future solution the “market” has chosen looks a lot like what we just saw.

2297 2018-01-08 19:16:26 I'd give you some upbeat "you can do it!" vibes, but I just made a chicken and pasta soup with enough butter and oil to see your face in the surface slick so - get in there with that garlic stodge, pal.

2322 2018-01-08 19:13:38 One segment of the market is sending a message, and it's a limited message in the greater context of the oil patch.

The most important note to me is that capitalization did not decrease because of it.
2323 2018-01-08 19:13:37 the fundamental difference to me is that most of what Dr Oz pushes is snake oil but often end up being sugar pills or useless. Somers pushes unregulated hormone therapy straight up

2338 2018-01-08 19:12:54 That’s called climate change. But we all know you’d rather line your own pockets off of big oil. Especially since now the taxpayers are on the hook for any oil spills. With all those pesky safety regulations gone what could possibly go wrong.
2339 2018-01-08 19:12:53 I took my car for service to Audi Center Mbombela today. They told me they changed a number of things and put on about 8 litre of oil. I paid almost R20 000 for the service.

Warren and Middle America go together like melting cheese on a popsicle.

The Joe Biden thing. I've got nothing. I agree on that.
2353 2018-01-08 19:10:50 Ohh I feel you. I'm still working on that but cleansing my face with tea tree oil really worked and you can use witch hazel in the evenings / apple cider vinegar
2354 2018-01-08 19:10:47 A bit of ham, basilicum, a bay leave, and some olive oil, about a 160 in a fan oven for about 2 hours, make sure to get all the hairs out before cooking. 
2355 2018-01-08 19:10:25 I have to take my car for an oil change 
2356 2018-01-08 19:10:22 Back in the distant path of my day (I’m 50!) I only had luck with Biactol. I don’t think it’s made anymore! Still suffered dry skin etc until I changed my diet- fewer chips, spuds, etc. More olive oil seems to have made a difference.
2357 2018-01-08 19:10:20 The tricks to Five Guys fries: Smallest order possible & use those paper trays for the peanuts to repackage & blot up excess oil. If you go non-rush & order, you are more likely to get oil @ perfect temp for least amount of grease possible.
2358 2018-01-08 19:10:19 Endless oil story
2359 2018-01-08 19:10:08 Um they were evicted as snow was still on ground- they requested and petitioned for further time to finish cleaning were denied-interesting you know/repeat one side only- used by oil company
2360 2018-01-08 19:09:51 Salt, pepper, granulated garlic, olive oil. The  to perfect potatoes every single time. 
2361 2018-01-08 19:09:33 wow, this is how weird reality really is with the lies that mr trump has said that the truth is ignored. Many americans dont' want to pollute or drill for oil, if trump didn't lie to the world, he would NOT have so much problems, he is sick mentally is why there are problems
2362 2018-01-08 19:09:30 Landowners: Contact BG before considering leasing or selling your oil, gas, or mineral rights.
2363 2018-01-08 19:09:20 Nothing but actually get the ball rolling hard on this unemployment swing. But you, getting coal miners killed, AT&T and Comcast employees layed off, oil spilled, North Korea finger on button, entire world laughing at us... GTFO, #FuckingMoron!
2364 2018-01-08 19:09:10 The Rock wants to see us clear the hurdles in life by sheer grit, which at least acknowledges the hurdles. Oprah spent her career shilling miracle cure Dr. Oz snake oil: if you're having a hard time it's just because you haven't given her sponsors enough of your money.
2365 2018-01-08 19:09:08 Stop building mosques in the USA that are funded by Middle Eastern oil companies.  We are just learning about political Islam and it's world conquest goals.  Hold the mosque building until we figure out what is going on in Europe!
2366 2018-01-08 19:08:52 When you gotta pay for a new plate sticker, oil change, new tires, and gas. Yeah fucc adulthood
2367 2018-01-08 19:08:45 Iraq pumps most of its 4.42 MMbpd from fields in the south & ships it from the Persian Gulf port of Basra. Irak = 2nd-biggest producer of OPEC #Oil #Irak #energy #OPEC
2368 2018-01-08 19:08:31 @UnivisionNews @MiamiHerald @RepCurbelo Make sure that any recreational planning includes oil spills from GOP allowing oil drilling off the east and west coast. GOP simply does not know how to govern.
2369 2018-01-08 19:08:26 if you only use coconut oil to remove your makeup and wash your face right after, is that still bad for it? Or should I use another makeup remover altogether
2370 2018-01-08 19:08:17 This will be a major step towards positive advancement of the Oil and Gas sector. At the same time India needs to look into the Renewable energy sector to cater to its huge energy requirements.

2381 2018-01-08 19:06:38 every time i go to the dealer to get my oil changed i have the same mecahanic guy. and every time i swear he’s high on crack.
2382 2018-01-08 19:06:35 Oh, Texas. Some nice rest stops here once you get past the oil fields!
2383 2018-01-08 19:06:31 Oh, I also once got told to 'flush out' my gallstones by drinking a pint of olive oil and lemon juice so I could avoid surgery. Which is not only complete nonsense, but also potentially quite dangerous.
2384 2018-01-08 19:06:30 I think oil has proven to be a curse for Venezuela, as it has been for many countries. Of course, it was bad policies by Chavez/Maduro that caused this crisis. But, oil facilitated it
2385 2018-01-08 19:06:27 Someone will now be using oil on you. Tufia. And only God knows the other things.
2386 2018-01-08 19:06:23 On what basis? My oil and gas friends all have jobs, trades are getting work in alternative industries, hell, even the retail outlook is better than it was. We weathered the economic downturn well and are back in growth. Please, elaborate if you have anything to add.

2392 2018-01-08 19:04:57 Even in a hundredth possibility without all the existing safety regulations in place now to be stripped away, offshore drilling is a treacherous endeavor. Thinking the enormity of oil spill disasters.
2393 2018-01-08 19:04:39 The Fulani herdsmen poses no danger but tourisms and entertainment, it was Nnamdi Kanu that posed danger, all these Northern Leeches, you people think you'll continue stealing the oil forever. Just a matter of time.
2394 2018-01-08 19:04:33 Replacing an elite winger like Hall is not an easier fix but wingers in general certainly are. And yet, as you said, it wasn't addressed in the summer.

2396 2018-01-08 19:04:30 Despite an economic crisis in Venezuela and unrest in Iran, OPEC says they will not increase oil output. The oil majors hold that their policy is to bring inventories down to normal levels. Small oil disruptions are of no concern #OPEC #oil #output #policy #inventory #goals #ENN
2397 2018-01-08 19:04:21 Gotta get a damn oil change
2398 2018-01-08 19:04:16 We need to utilize our resources and stop relying on foreign oil. We can find a way to make it cleaner. Save American jobs and families.

2403 2018-01-08 19:03:04 Major economic power?!
With 15% inflation for three years? You do not really understand economics do you?
Oil is the only commodity they can sell. True. But the rate of oil is too low for Iran to even stop their deficit.
Iran is a financial mess.
2404 2018-01-08 19:02:52 I use an lemon/lavender/peppermint essential oil pill that i make myself! It helps a lot with my anxiety & my mood swings
2405 2018-01-08 19:02:46 "I'm sorry" makes everything okay

2406 2018-01-08 19:02:33 True. Nor is it the oil industry’s interest to switch to hydrogen-fuelled cell cars, but governments are setting deadlines and building infrastructure. Even ours, so they know where the growth will be.
2407 2018-01-08 19:02:33 Anyone who uses the oil on me will pay my rent, feed and clothe me for 7 years and then run mad for 7 market days, I'm not even joking, I'm Dada and spiritually untouchable, ask around.
2408 2018-01-08 19:02:28 They do and the problem is the Oilers will be in said conundrum starting next season if they need to make multiple adds.
2409 2018-01-08 19:02:27 Not many people know for example 90 percent of Haiti's government budget annually is from Venezuelan oil trade via Petrocaribe.

You can imagine that they are worried about the future now that Venezuelan oil is kind of a chaotic bet.

I know this stuff. I dunno why I just do.

2431 2018-01-08 18:59:57 Your husband didn't marry you just because you were a virgin but because you had an extra oil in you.
2432 2018-01-08 18:59:56 if you whisper the word "oil" within 18 inches of my face, I break out, but this isn't oil-free and SOMEHOW I have precious moment figurine face despite drinking a bottle of wine and sleeping 4 hours last night
2433 2018-01-08 18:59:52 But that quote is absurd. Bitcoin is tiny compared to other asset classes. Its ostensible $250B market cap is
1) illusory
2) not representative of the total money put into the system
3) a fraction of the money changing hands over oil *every week*

2450 2018-01-08 18:58:17 Venezuela would have been much better off it had never let the western oil companies into the country and let the oil stay in the ground until they learned how to drill for it themselves.

It's a noble struggle....but then why would you support a prez that wants to do oil drilling in Appalachacola Bay and you voted for a bill that cuts oil spill cleanups that could happen in that area again.  So disingenuous.
2455 2018-01-08 18:57:33 And celebrate the rebound of oil and gas:)
2456 2018-01-08 18:57:29 Oven baked brussel sprouts halved or quartered then tossed in a little olive oil, salt, & pepper. Also sautéed peppers and onions and corn (we buy frozen) are really easy to add to multiple dishes to bulk up.

2464 2018-01-08 18:56:32 Venezuela's crisis was created by Capitalism. Saudis deliberately undercut their oil market with the encouragement of the US. Imported food prices were driven sky high- also deliberate.

2483 2018-01-08 18:53:45 Get some olive oil anoint your dwelling at the door and windows. Pray I rebuke the strong hold of drugs in this home. Yeshua /Jesus I plead the blood you paid for me over my home and family. Clean my home of the past and all evil must go in your name!  Get rid of paraphernalia.
2484 2018-01-08 18:53:27 Beautiful.  Where is that?  Malibu?
2485 2018-01-08 18:53:26 i usually either sniff a bunch of eucalyptus oil, press my tongue into the soft back part of the roof of my mouth, or take some ibuprofen for the inflammation :-) also pressing hard into my temple helps me with head pressure too!
2486 2018-01-08 18:53:19 I'll see if I can find it. It was mid way through last year, I saw it in a news feed.  Sure it was OPEC. As the oil producers would switch to producing hydrogen fuel products. 
Got to drive back to yard now, but I will look soon as i can.
2487 2018-01-08 18:52:45 Hopefully this oil helps this annoying ass day
2488 2018-01-08 18:52:40 If you'd like some advice, try exfoliating. You can buy a product made for lips, or mix sugar with olive oil/coconut oil/lip balm/Vaseline/you get the idea. As long as your lips aren't cracked to the point of bleeding, it should help the dry skin.
2489 2018-01-08 18:52:37 We love an oil spill don’t we 
2490 2018-01-08 18:52:22 an obvious photo shop edit......and a bad one at that
2491 2018-01-08 18:52:14 Oprah is a seductive speaker. #BEWARE  Best Snake Oil sales woman ever. Made her $Millions and more $Millions off of gullible white housewives who were suckered in to her show. Emotional dependency.
2492 2018-01-08 18:51:55 Going to start putting varnish on my #paintings. Apparently you have to wait 6-12 months to put spray varnish over oil #paint. This might take a while...
2493 2018-01-08 18:51:41 thanks bb! i usually use coconut oil but i didnt bring it w me to chicago, and i use a grease palette for all my linework and the black stained me last night lol
2494 2018-01-08 18:51:33 But girls don’t care until that moment when their life flashes b4 their eyes cuz girl wey rub oil 4 Toto go jam man wey wan cut her head for ritual. Who go win? I feel bad 4 girls who go missing unaccounted for in this Lagos.
2495 2018-01-08 18:51:18 @Varneyco Give cannabis fair coverage Varney. CBD oil is legal in all 50 states and is a God send to some people's health. The psychoactive THC has been removed. have Dr. Mark Siegel talk about medical marijuana.
2496 2018-01-08 18:51:17 I tried to avoid EVERY oil change place but this one.  all my@other places didn’t have oil or they were booked.
2497 2018-01-08 18:51:07 Goodluck n have fun!!
2498 2018-01-08 18:51:06 Brake oil.
2499 2018-01-08 18:50:52 Thank heavens for the oil rebound. It was the cause of the downturn & we all are wise and astute enough to know it is the cause of the rebound. No different than the past governments on the oil rollercoaster.
2500 2018-01-08 18:50:49 I need a good all natural face moisturizer that’s safe for acne prone skin! Please send suggestions! Nothing with coconut oil in it though!
2501 2018-01-08 18:50:49 Yes so here. Boil yourself some water. Get you some weed of course. I used about 2 grams. Break the weed down & coat it completely with oil or butter. Get 2 bags of whatever tea you like. Empty the contents out of one of the bags. Put your weed in the empty tea bag. Seal it back,
2502 2018-01-08 18:50:17 It’s coconut oil. Nice try recycling a good joke. 
2503 2018-01-08 18:50:14 My hair finally at the chief keef finally rich stage. It’s been a long time coming. I would like to thank Jamaican castor oil and God
2504 2018-01-08 18:49:43 Tbh, having them is not a problem, monitoring them is the problem. We have seen what some have and are doing in the oil and gas sector. Not palatable. If there is proper exchange of tech and man power, win-win for all.
2505 2018-01-08 18:49:37 옫돋케 알아쮜~~~~~~? 깔깔깔
2506 2018-01-08 18:49:35 So I got eyelash extensions and I am trying to get them off and nothing is working !!! I have tried coconut oil, olive oil!!! What should I do? And the place I got them done said they don’t remove them 
2507 2018-01-08 18:49:29 Just read a post that Tropicana orange juice has fish in it. Tilapia to be exact...
I was like FISH OIL? jesus fix it. 
Yes the omega 3 enhanced juice has fish oil.
2508 2018-01-08 18:49:23 Let me translate: I don't have anything else coherent to say so I will pick up my marbles & run home crying. Very typical
2509 2018-01-08 18:49:22 Sky News - from horrendous oil disaster to a Princesses choice in shoes. Really? REALLY? #gfy #skynews
2510 2018-01-08 18:49:12 What doesn't happen? Are you comparing salaries of the same job? Or are you comparing an elementary teacher (highly female) with an oil rig worker (highly male)?
2511 2018-01-08 18:49:11 $86 for an oil change. I remember when I used to pay 19.99
2512 2018-01-08 18:49:10 Misunderstandings or incorrect assumptions. Big Oil spends a large pile of money to spin consumers around. The facts: ethanol blends are cheaper (10% ethanol is currently 30 cents cheaper; 15% is 40c), are higher octane (better engine performance), and produce far fewer emissions
2513 2018-01-08 18:49:06 Everyone has just been pissing me off today and I come home to cook but we ran out of oil and I’ve just flipped lmao. Good one g 
2514 2018-01-08 18:49:01 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
2515 2018-01-08 18:48:58 Oil change than off to target 
2516 2018-01-08 18:48:54 Oil change because she a newer vehicle this shit high 
2517 2018-01-08 18:48:50 More oil for us will keep the ragheads out of our lives.   After we drill new wells we should bomb theirs and everything will get better cause China won;t know where to get oil and then North Korea won't get help and we can blow them up too.   Trump is making America Great Again.
2518 2018-01-08 18:48:47 41 litres de gas~oil  5,60 € de plus La note de fin d'année va être salée et sans compter le reste qui ne sera pas des moindres
2519 2018-01-08 18:48:46 Oil??
2520 2018-01-08 18:48:37 Funny how Tom “Eco Green” Steyer made billions in the Oil patch only to turn over a Green Leaf or as they say, a New Investment Scheme.
2521 2018-01-08 18:48:23 I like lower taxes and regulation "snake oil".
2522 2018-01-08 18:48:17 Okay fork oil n carb settings with belly buster n brew next outing 
2523 2018-01-08 18:48:06 Why must my oil changes be so expensive ?! 
2524 2018-01-08 18:47:59 Palm oil.
2525 2018-01-08 18:47:49 blood is thicker than water, but motor oil is thicker than blood so where does that leave us
2526 2018-01-08 18:47:44 The closest I ever got to original cuisine was at the Sri Swaminaryan Mandir in Neasden: veggie, no garlic or onion (sic), no alcohol. German Indian restaurants: less oil, less hot, more sause, sometimes different papadams, bhatura, hardly ever chutney for the starter.
2527 2018-01-08 18:47:19 This is anything but a 'far away' issue. Look at our air and horizon from February through December. See the smog? That's largely due to our addiction to oil. Wow, some just don't seem to get it!
2528 2018-01-08 18:47:17 African Black Soap, Rosehip seed oil(use as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF,at all times),Lemon brightening Overnight Serum(use daily at night after cleansing), Turmeric brightening mask(use once/twice a week)& Citrus scrub (use once/twice a week)
2529 2018-01-08 18:47:13 This must be what my Grandfather used to call a snake oil salesmen?  
2530 2018-01-08 18:47:12 Really, name calling is so juvenile, don't you think?
2531 2018-01-08 18:46:58 #ableg #abed If we can get food safety inspection = to Canada's high standards, perhaps tariffs should decrease. Buy then "buy Canadian" is good for oil to the Maritimes to our own remarkably still .99lb turkeys.
2532 2018-01-08 18:46:53 I'm a little concerned with the bit about them playing in Lucas Oil 
2533 2018-01-08 18:46:40 Not good for lubricating moving parts! That'll wash out grease, bearings come packed with grease. You'll get more heat after washing it out with oil, resulting in more heat and ultimately more wear. Good for a cheap fix but probably need a new fan/bearings etc anyway long term
2534 2018-01-08 18:46:31 8
2535 2018-01-08 18:46:30 im out of fuel oil and i hate being cold please kill me
2536 2018-01-08 18:46:28 my hair: dripping oil
my mom: r u seriously gonna wash your hair AGAIN?!?!
2537 2018-01-08 18:46:25 So while the Fed is potentially damaging the environment opening public lands oil and mining nightmares citing states rights—-it’s going after the ecological Marijuana industry against the will of people in states that have legalized production and use. 
Confusing
2538 2018-01-08 18:46:25 many things catching fire recently....iranian oil tankers...northern california....bill and hills place...trump towers.....directed energy weapons...tit for tat....and that book...ready aim fire
2539 2018-01-08 18:46:10 ending my Monday with a coconut oil hair treatment and my favourite @lorealparis face mask while rewatching the 5th season of #GossipGirl 
2540 2018-01-08 18:45:47 Yes I do have a little humidifer on, and I have a few drops of menthol essential oil in it :) Feels really good. Thank you.

2543 2018-01-08 18:45:21 The fish oil of the child is to be sent. Translation: Mafura a ngwana ke go romiwa
2544 2018-01-08 18:45:15 I got bio oil today, watch how I become flawless and then you'll see.
2545 2018-01-08 18:45:01 Oil wey I go use hand rub,put am for her face before I do..Them dey use juju catch juju?awon mad people

2547 2018-01-08 18:44:44 Air conditioning compressor's have oil in them. Multi-floor air conditioner's could have over 5 gallon's in it. Hard for it to catch fire but when it does it's tough to put out!
2548 2018-01-08 18:44:37 Now playing: Incubus - Oil And Water
2549 2018-01-08 18:44:20 If you’re using cheaper essential oil brands please don’t use them topically! Oils aren’t FDA regulated so they can write anything on the bottle including “100% pure oil” when it’s mainly chemicals & artificial smells!!!!!
2550 2018-01-08 18:44:19 I thought Jesus’s middle name was Herbert...
2551 2018-01-08 18:44:02 The Trump Administration moved last week to expand US offshore oil drilling, rescind Obama era guidelines on marijuana prosecutions, and close down the voter fraud panel - Barron's
2552 2018-01-08 18:43:58 If you really believe an #Iran oil tanker actually crashed into Chinese ship, in that big open body of water, all the while catching flames as a result, you need to re-evaluate the events. #fakenews
2553 2018-01-08 18:43:22 Pure ragin'.  Oil (Revenues) - the elephant in the Separatists' room.  And in their hair.
2554 2018-01-08 18:43:15 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
2555 2018-01-08 18:42:55 Querkle Indica Dip Stick has Blue City Diesel Rosin Oil and Grape Stomper Kief! $13(rec tax,med)
2556 2018-01-08 18:42:49 Awful. Germany has been a leader in transitioning off fossil fuels. This is hideous backsliding when the world needs even more leadership. This is right there w/Norway's offshore oil development suit -- bad news.
2557 2018-01-08 18:42:48 Or maybe if the government finally stops suppressing all alternative fuel sources cause big oil has their nuts in a vice.
2558 2018-01-08 18:42:43 Turkey with a bunch of vegetables and oil&vinegar
2559 2018-01-08 18:42:42 I just made myself a protein shake consisting of dark coffee, almond butter, and some coconut oil. It tastes terrible.  Nutrition trial and error, ha.

2560 2018-01-08 18:42:36 They had my perfect meal. Best Cesar salad I’ve ever had, bread w/ olive oil, sautéed shrimp in a red sauce & a raspberry Italian soda. 
2561 2018-01-08 18:42:31 Wonder if Chris Matthews is tingling again.
2562 2018-01-08 18:42:31 Yup. Plenty of taxis with hundreds of k miles on the clock. BMW said theirs will last 15 years (should be a lot longer). This battery life thing is another lie spread by the oil and hydrogen lobby.
2563 2018-01-08 18:42:30 Palm oil? Working from home... 
2564 2018-01-08 18:42:27 vitamin E oil is fucking great, get into it.
2565 2018-01-08 18:42:18 Tomorrow I'm going to get my car an oil change
Start on my Ranka Lee Cosplay
Work on my comic a little bit as well. I'm like 3 pages in on shading
2566 2018-01-08 18:42:17 don't know what question u r refering to but this president has done nothing to deserve my respect and has done plenty to deserve my disrespect. I honor my country by being outraged that Constitution & laws are being flaunted & dishonored by the current administration.
2567 2018-01-08 18:42:15 Would love to but ur daddy sessions had a sit down with pharma.
2568 2018-01-08 18:42:13 Listening to Friday @leftrightcenter - imperative to hear all sides & a great show.  @RichLowry I completely disagree advocating offshore drilling.  All decisions can't be based on $. Environment must come 1st.  Depending on oil companies to be more careful is ridiculous. #ComeOn
2569 2018-01-08 18:42:12 so, i'm oiling my hair because i decided i'd take better care of my hair this year and this fucking fat drop of oil falls straight into my eye. like ??? here i am trying to be better and this is how the universe repays me. it still kinda burns cause my mum puts in neem and stuff

2572 2018-01-08 18:41:55 And meanwhile in Puerto Rico, Americans lack electricity and safe drinking water...

Trump: shall we drill for more oil?
2573 2018-01-08 18:41:54 That’s not good for the Kurds.  They built a big pipeline to Turkey those guys. With all the oil going to the Shia Iran from Kirkuk we know why the Iranians kicked the Kurds out of Kirkuk. It was only for oil.
2574 2018-01-08 18:41:53 true, but some ppl try to mix water with oil
2575 2018-01-08 18:41:51 Owned my M3 for 2+ years too, only needed new rear tires and the normal oil change.

2578 2018-01-08 18:40:57 I dilute it with another oil because yes lol
2579 2018-01-08 18:40:57 Hardly a new problem. Scars of bldgs demolished decades ago are everywhere - E 63rd St, for ex: many visible former foundations of buildings. Gardeners on vacant plots regularly remove brick/stone/metal. A new bldg needed soil remediation to get rid of underground oil tanks, etc.
2580 2018-01-08 18:40:46 Pasta & tin of anchovies in olive oil & tinned tomatoes plus garlic to taste. Cook pasta. At same time (this doesn't take as long as pasta - maybe 4-5 mins) cook anchovies in oil and garlic over low heat until they turn into a paste, add tomatoes for sauce. Optional capers too.
2581 2018-01-08 18:40:36 Tea tree oil is a GOD SEND but I've also heard toothpaste is good?
2582 2018-01-08 18:40:27 oil free
2583 2018-01-08 18:40:11 My friend uses some essential oils that her mom gave her and says they seem to help. I’ve considered getting an oil diffuser, I’ve wondered if they really work.
2584 2018-01-08 18:40:09 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。
2585 2018-01-08 18:39:48 Oil marketers will soon call for increase in petrol price and that will lead to scarcity
2586 2018-01-08 18:39:45 I got beard oil on my doorknob and now I can’t get out of the bathroom
2587 2018-01-08 18:39:43 InfoChip's tags are chemically etched & designed to withstand harsh conditions found in mines, on #oil rigs, & other industrial areas.

2589 2018-01-08 18:39:38 You're missing the part about where she endorses snake oil salesmen to sell products on her show, and gave a platform to a "psychiatrist" who breaks every ethical norm and exploits mental illness for profit.
2590 2018-01-08 18:39:25 This sounds like my brother. The idiot wouldn’t even let me make a sugar scrub for him because I used a little olive oil in it.
2591 2018-01-08 18:39:24 I think you missed the point, this is not necessarily a legislative matter. As you should know, a president can sign EO's. In this case, he could have extended the protection for another length of time but didn't.
2592 2018-01-08 18:39:14 u gave me fish oil pills smh
2593 2018-01-08 18:39:14 I just realized I need an oil change 
2594 2018-01-08 18:39:13 whether GM is good or bad is controversial - even among environmentalists. Lung cancer, oil spills & species extinction is not controversial & only supported by those who gain financially
2595 2018-01-08 18:38:57 Yes essential oils !! I don’t use them often but I have. I like body washes and lotions with them in it. Look into buying an oil diffuser !
2596 2018-01-08 18:38:54 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
2597 2018-01-08 18:38:53 So are the enormous profits by pharmaceuticals! Big Pharma, Oil... don't need subsidies when they ultimately pass the buck to tax paying citizens!
2598 2018-01-08 18:38:47 Dobson, Graham, Falwell & Robertson are reporting a slump in snake oil sales nationally.
2599 2018-01-08 18:38:45 I did a oil treatment overnight and when I tell you my curls are looking nice af today 
2600 2018-01-08 18:38:39 Sitting here waiting for my oil change...  I realized and regret that I haven't eaten anything yet, I can feel my glucose levels dropping rapidly...
2601 2018-01-08 18:38:39 Don't forget, silver, gold, crude oil, diamonds, aquifers and the best top soil is all very low! Also what goes up must come down, going high isn't always the answer! Going low is necessary when it is strategically or tactically required! All things are good or bad depending...
2602 2018-01-08 18:38:33 Whettttt girl veggies in a stir fry >>>!!! Get yourself some sesame oil and ginger and soy sauce! When I get home I’m sending u some recipes
2603 2018-01-08 18:38:31 Like the Oil...but its only worth $60 a barrel now...Fine $60 is better than nothing right? :D anyone with the word Butchers apron in profile is only here for one thing..Trolling. blocked now!
2604 2018-01-08 18:38:26 I have new essential oils arriving in the mail tomorrow for my oil diffuser and I wish they were coming today! I hate waiting. New gloves are also arriving lol.
2605 2018-01-08 18:38:10 olive oil is perfect for your skin.but not under the hot sun.basically you're just cooking yourself using it as a tanning oil 
2606 2018-01-08 18:38:05 Permi man gd out of stock ng castor oil sa mga botika ba hahahahaha mao dira ah nalang ko mamalit kaysa sa online

2610 2018-01-08 18:37:24 Alright alright back to the gym today after loading up on my fish oil, vitamin B and Vitamin D3.
2611 2018-01-08 18:37:07 They didn’t mean it. Hold this over their heads.
2612 2018-01-08 18:37:01 Let’s not forget his overriding of Denton’s ban on fracking. Abbots oil and gas buddies made sure he took care of that. Small government my ass. He who has $$$ governs, not the people.
2613 2018-01-08 18:36:51 Yeah! In the summer I just use it on my face, winter I use it as body soap every  other shower because the oil in it is the perfect amount
2614 2018-01-08 18:36:39 Oil of Geranium 
2615 2018-01-08 18:36:32 I think you could find many more & more serious examples of the bad corporate lobbyists do in the name of greed. Tobacco, oil, endangered species, car manufacturers, mining, military, agrochemicals ....
2616 2018-01-08 18:36:22 Russia wants Trump to allow Exxon Mobile to give the technology to Russia so it can better afford to drill oil and sell it cheaper than now. Clinton never would allow. Russia needed Trump
2617 2018-01-08 18:36:21 I bet you could use baby oil as lube and make god disappointed.
2618 2018-01-08 18:36:10 Or even people you do know.
2619 2018-01-08 18:35:54 Moroccan oil? They sell mascara infused with it
2620 2018-01-08 18:35:51 Truth is like oil. No matter how much water you pour on it, it will always float.----- #Africanproverb
2621 2018-01-08 18:35:47 Depends what you mean by that Wilson/Callaghan governments would have considered themselves to be centre left! The Blair creature was more Tory than some Tories I know! If the ample resource is oil, then it wasn’t yours, it was ours!

2627 2018-01-08 18:33:55 It would be different if his previous moves had somehow put the Oil into an amazing/sustainable cap position; they are not positioned cap-wise to improve this team. It’s remarkable.

2640 2018-01-08 18:32:36 especially since it's carrying a special type of oil called Condensate which cannot be pulled off the surface & instead attacks microbes which eat oil & will make the area too toxic to fish in - In America this sort of #environmentaldisaster is coming soon to a coastline near you

2657 2018-01-08 18:30:23 @DZederman @Jurko64 jurko74@carmendefalco. Sorry to hear the disappointment in Jurko voice. I took my car for a complete oil change anti freeze. Finally works. Need stuff for it today. Anyway tell Jurk to call me. Maybe even tho I didn't book it I can get something done to help
2658 2018-01-08 18:30:19 Prof. Banks just described his Modern Middle East course as exciting because "its like Scandal but with oil and sand."
2659 2018-01-08 18:30:17 Those folks who ignore their families' needs & go become servants in their pastors'  houses, their canes are being soaked in engine oil
2660 2018-01-08 18:30:17 OIL DIFF: 6.4 -> 6.44
2661 2018-01-08 18:30:16 The orange one has the option of extending this status.    You still didn’t answer my question?  You obviously know very little on this subject.
2662 2018-01-08 18:30:15 Oil spills are manageable. Tell that to the poor creatures who unfairly lost their lives to one.
2663 2018-01-08 18:30:08 Today I got an oil change and new wipers and boy am I excited, this is adult life huh?
2664 2018-01-08 18:29:47 I thought I saw a recent Gartner Research note that said Data Catalogs are the new oil.
2665 2018-01-08 18:29:38 So is politician worship. Or worship of anybody you don't personally know, come to think of it.
2666 2018-01-08 18:29:30 2018 has been great for heating oil and boogers.
2667 2018-01-08 18:29:23 i have a painting idea but it’s big and would have to be in oil which i haven’t done in ages so i’m worried about both my skill’s and my paint’s integrity :T
2668 2018-01-08 18:29:18 It’s really tricky when it comes to food & cannabutter/thc oil. Good food makes you high.... then you’re high & wanna eat more.... then you’re slumped on the couch & done for the night.
2669 2018-01-08 18:29:13 Pray over tap water...or olive oil.
2670 2018-01-08 18:29:03 Cool. I support carbon pricing. We already have it in Alberta and no none even noticed. High oil prices add far more to my cost of living than the carbon levy does.  And lower income Albertans gets rebates.
2671 2018-01-08 18:28:42 we did not specify where the demand comes from. why is the US in Africa? so all trade of African oil can be secured in USD? so that all countries in Africa will have an IMF controlled central bank?
2672 2018-01-08 18:28:02 A former executive at a previous company made the "Enron guys were misunderstood and did nothing wrong" point quite frequently.  I think it's a common sentiment among even less conservative Oil & Gas types (this was at a biofuels startup in the SFBay area).
2673 2018-01-08 18:27:30 Being an oil nation without the biggest structure, ;-)
2674 2018-01-08 18:27:24 Would be great to have a kit to test and create solution in the oil and gas sector. The potensials are  big but we need to show before users understand what this really is able to do...
2675 2018-01-08 18:27:15 When your Filipino friends ask for your fried rice you know it’s  it was dank af cuz I cooked it with THC oil

2681 2018-01-08 18:26:35 yes, we already discussed what temporary means so let me give you my definition. Temporary should mean until the situation in El Salvador becomes safe for all to return. It is NOT there yet. It is interesting how this administration is willing to put 200,000 ppl in peril.
2682 2018-01-08 18:26:29 ؟ ADSL ممكن توضحلنا المشكلة اللى بتواجهك فى موبايل انترنت ولا

2683 2018-01-08 18:26:28 How is ending immigration protection for 200,000 Salvadorians, taking protections away from Dreamers, etc. exhibit any sense of empathy or sense?  It is vindictive, cruel and racist.  You claim to love the environment?  How is oil drilling on all coasts & destroying EPA good?
2684 2018-01-08 18:26:08 Not to self, do not chug two bottles of water before going to get your oil changed.
2685 2018-01-08 18:26:04 I’ve had a tin of mackerel in tommy sauce with kibble for breakfast and a bonio when I finished it, and more kibble for tea mixed with yoghurt and another bonio because I finished it too. I have a cod liver oil and evening primrose oil tablet too. I have cheap tastes lol
2686 2018-01-08 18:25:45 That was me trying to be witty. Someone once left a comment on a blog stating that their nutritionist had recommended the use of Olive Oil as it contains no fat.

I replied that, as Olive Oil contains 100% fat, they should find a different nutritionist!
2687 2018-01-08 18:25:43 Got my CBD and they tossed in some Hemp oil to for under the tongue in the morning.

2698 2018-01-08 18:23:44 I can give speeches to hundreds of people and corral 50+ summer campers, but when it comes to pulling my car up to get an oil change, man, that's where the anxiety kicks in.
2699 2018-01-08 18:23:38 Came to get an oil change & I forgot my charger & my book 
2700 2018-01-08 18:23:26 They will tell you oil price.

2702 2018-01-08 18:23:12 Went to target to grab some tea tree oil and walked out with 3 bags of vegan chicken nuggets and no oil - I finally get it
2703 2018-01-08 18:23:07 I remember I got my ass knocked out leaving the oil spill back in 08. I was dumb drunk I didn't even know who or what hit me! Lol niggas never really wanted to line up with me....
2704 2018-01-08 18:23:04 It's one snake oil salesman or another.
2705 2018-01-08 18:23:03 And left with waste product. I kid you not a neighbour servicing his old car disposed of his old oil down a street drain. “I said no offence mate but that’s just wrong take to the local dump in a container” “I’ve been doing for years no one has ever complained” was the response
2706 2018-01-08 18:23:00 How did you sauté the onions and things without oil?

2712 2018-01-08 18:22:34 I don’t think winning the House seat is enough; she has to showcase her platform while in that seat. That’s the piece missing for me. That and the Dr Oz snake oil.

To clarify: I think if Oprah runs, she’ll probably win. However, I’m convinced legislative experience is important.

2719 2018-01-08 18:22:09 I have no problem with Arctic oil and gas but it is also true it is not profitable in the Canadian Arctic. So the drill/ don’t drill dichotomy is a red herring.

2736 2018-01-08 18:19:44 There is no law that says refugees must leave the security of USA to go back to what still is a dangerous situation in El Salvador. That is the bigotry & ignorance of this administration. Like you, their compassion is nationalistic & quite un-American.

2745 2018-01-08 18:17:56 I don't trust anything that comes out of your father's mouth.  Your father is taking us back instead of forward.  Drilling in the Arctic Refugee and the oceans is disgusting and we need to move on from oil. Stop being in bed with the oil companies.
2746 2018-01-08 18:17:32 For the record I am not for any government. They're all snake oil hustlers.
2747 2018-01-08 18:17:31 I don't dismiss her viability as a candidate. I dismiss her viability as a national leader.

2757 2018-01-08 18:16:45 There is no need to end TPS status now except for the fact that these immigrants are brown. But getting back to my original question that you did not answer?  What is the process for these immigrants to get perm resident status.
2758 2018-01-08 18:16:40 I bought $OILD on Friday.  Curious to see if XLE outperforms oil during the pullback since it underperformed during the ascent.

2760 2018-01-08 18:16:18 It therefore seems to me that Iraq wants to povertise Kurdistan and then force the Kurds to the point of all out war leading to declaration of independence but without the benefit of the oil rich areas of Kurdistan. Shia want the resources and to ethnically cleanse the Kurds

2765 2018-01-08 18:15:51 I COMPLETELY agree with everything you’ve just said. The same goes for Jamie Dimon - CEO of Chase, every oil tycoon, Wall Street superstar and large cap CEO. Hollywood just doesn’t give them the benefit of the doubt. #hypocrisy All I’m saying.

2767 2018-01-08 18:15:46 I won't get tired of trying to work with an oil firm this year...
2768 2018-01-08 18:15:42 And no MCT or coconut oil, yes?
2769 2018-01-08 18:15:30 Thats d trend in every institution
2770 2018-01-08 18:15:09 but the present president boasted to enrich the country via Agriculture, why are we still hearing oil this and that?
2771 2018-01-08 18:14:33 Surely this must mean we are free to stand an armed occupation in our wilderness areas to prevent encroachment by outside oil, gas & coal corporations.

2774 2018-01-08 18:14:06 How is your skin bearing up? Did you buy the oil I recommended
2775 2018-01-08 18:14:05 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
2776 2018-01-08 18:14:03 Skincare annoys me it’s literally all silicon oil and parabens
2777 2018-01-08 18:14:01 What's the agenda of the meeting?  Planning to establish a factory in Bahrin to make cola from crude oil?  @INCIndia
2778 2018-01-08 18:13:58 Oil is denominated in USD because it was voted on, but that is changing to China soon. This is mostly arbitrary to the value of oil. Same with crypto or other Stores of Value.
2779 2018-01-08 18:13:41 They said oil company that year
2780 2018-01-08 18:13:34 Need an oil change too
2781 2018-01-08 18:13:34 The roads are wet and slick with oil today friends.

Slow down and be nice .

That extra 30 seconds is not worth your life or someone else’s 
2782 2018-01-08 18:13:31 I'm in so much pain looking at this.  Those spark plugs must be SOAKED in oil just for that picture.
2783 2018-01-08 18:13:14 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2784 2018-01-08 18:13:10 Nothing like a fresh juice with rice milk, heirloom kale, and biodynamic coconut oil to start the day. Namaste.

2787 2018-01-08 18:12:59 Funny how when the talk is about school costs these figures are too high but you are willing to pay double or triple to keep these same kids locked up or to send over seas to die for oil money
2788 2018-01-08 18:12:48 MCT oil my dude. It’s so amazing. I’ve only been on taking this + keto in a week and already the mental clarity that’s peeking through like FUCK YOUR BREAD AND SUGAR Y’ALL I’M OUT

2792 2018-01-08 18:12:29 I was being sarcastic. My 2012 328i has a blown engine due to failure of the plastic timing chain guide. No warning. Left my wife in the middle of the highway. Recently had oil changed at BMW dealership.
2793 2018-01-08 18:12:11 Why keep drilling when you've already struck oil? 

Seriously, well done. WTG!
2794 2018-01-08 18:12:07 won't someone please think of the oil barons
2795 2018-01-08 18:12:04 still no refund so i still can’t pay rent or buy groceries or get my oil changed this is making me MAD
2796 2018-01-08 18:11:55 My skin is so dry.  I want to soak in a nice warm vat of coconut oil.
2797 2018-01-08 18:11:40 damnit my laptop is covered in oil
2798 2018-01-08 18:11:32 When Exxon Valdez accident happened, some areas were treated and some were not. The untreated areas actually recovered faster. Oil spills are manageable. Demonizing oil is irrational.

2801 2018-01-08 18:11:09 Did you guys know Taco Bell used to fry their tortillas in coconut oil before they were forced to change for health reasons in '87?  Now coconut oil is considered one of the healthiest cooking fats.
2802 2018-01-08 18:11:08 Well that won’t do...there’s no money in peace...we can’t have that, oil prices will fall and weapon sales will be down.
2803 2018-01-08 18:10:38 The agreement is another achievement for Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who successfully inserted language into the sweeping tax overhaul bill that for the first time in a generation allows oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. drill baby dri
2804 2018-01-08 18:10:25 Ah yes because if I feel like 2+2=2.2 then it must be correct becuase otherwise you're being sexist!

2826 2018-01-08 18:07:13 If it's not poison, why does air pollution exist, mad rushes to contain and clean up oil spills on the land and waters? Why do we see reams of dead birds, fish and other wildlife soaked in oil when there's a spill?

Emerald Triangle would help us with the Kannebosm for the anointing oil original recipe hot tub spa treatment. Need to draw up the new snorkel design first
2832 2018-01-08 18:05:50 Such a pro business pro oil pro carbon emitter stand from someone charged with protecting our Public Lands. what a shortsighted and ignorant position. I will send $ to you opponent.  And no one steals lands.
2833 2018-01-08 18:05:40 Totally agree. But winger is a way easier fix. But should have been this summer not next with no cap left. Either way hope there’s a different gm addressing it this summer.
2834 2018-01-08 18:05:38 Venezuela pegged to dollar because they're only industry is oil.Import everything. Oil prices collapsed. Corruption rife. Debt in dollars to US/China they can't pay-  poor policy,  black market, drought. Economic problems entirely specific to the country.
2835 2018-01-08 18:05:38 He left office in the 80s, Nigeria's refineries were build during his tenure as oil minister in the 70s, fast forward 30yrs later, not one refinery was added & Nigeria became an oil importing country from an oil exporting one and u expect Buhari to solve all our problems in 3yrs?
2836 2018-01-08 18:05:24 In South Korea they really aren't worried about NK.. He's a poser and the people are starving.. If everyone keeps their (nuclear war)heads, he'll be overthrown within a few years but Russia is interfering in the blockade of oil & the US won't go after Russia any more

2842 2018-01-08 18:04:40 あしたじゃないね今日ね……
2843 2018-01-08 18:04:35 Or have all federal structures and roads in Abuja written "Niger-Delta oil money".The white walkers are coming faster than expected!
2844 2018-01-08 18:04:25 right, Oil is denominated in dollars and when the dollar goes down oil prices go up.  So why not the same relationship with any and everything else denominated in dollars, including bit coin?
2845 2018-01-08 18:04:17 If there is one thing that I pay to have someone else do that I would like to learn... it’d be changing the oil in a car. Lol

2853 2018-01-08 18:03:25 for this administration it is all about race. They are so worried that the white population is being overtaken by black & brown so race is a very big part of this move. When ppl settle in America they sometimes use up resources but more often become productive members.
2854 2018-01-08 18:03:16 And, again, oil cos are free riders. I never claimed free riders are only from liberal policies. As a matter of fact, I have cleared that up at least 3 times.

2862 2018-01-08 18:02:13 Energy is not denominated in oil, but when oil prices go down solar prices go up. It’s just market correlation, same with other markets. Also, Bitcoin is a world currency, it’s not constrained by boarders unlike USD.

The Norwegians found oil 50 years ago and their Lutheran mojo helped the economy boom. And now, their democracy works bc the govt actually has the resources to help them.
2866 2018-01-08 18:01:55 Dermalogica products. They’re expensive but last forever. I use their essential cleansing solution, antioxidant hydra mist, and intensive moisture balance. Also recommend their hydrating booster and phyto replenish oil. Helps keep my dry skin nice and moisturized

2868 2018-01-08 18:01:42 .
Rubbish 6°c. 
But engines are still running on used cooking oil at these temps.
And it’s a phenomenon that 1-7° can feel colder than -10° when all the humidity has turned to #ice and the air is cold and dry.
2869 2018-01-08 18:01:34 As well - serum goes under oil or moisturiser 
2870 2018-01-08 18:01:33 Free riders as defined as oil companies and entitlement cheats. However, the oil companies don’t really pertain to this argument because,  strawman. Right?
2871 2018-01-08 18:01:25 People knew it was about Iraq’s Oil & nothing to do with Saddam being a Dictator.

2878 2018-01-08 18:00:18 I dunno how LA is, but look, in Texas, that first downpour after a long dry spell could be treacherous as all the old oil that was left on the road mixed with the water and made a lovely mess.

2900 2018-01-08 17:58:03 Yas!!! My husband and I LOVE this! @GlamLifeGuru have you used the scalp revival oil they have? I'm curious about it.

2902 2018-01-08 17:57:42 I saw them kissing in ICM

Twitter date gone wrong in ICM

Bring the Oil to ICM

Kings and Queens stay away from ICM.   There's a funny spirit there
2903 2018-01-08 17:57:35 One polar bear will feed a starving family in the Appalachians for a month. I think of all the people not on welfare when I see factory photo. I never realize turtles were that good for sponging of crude oil we should send them all to Saudi Arabia and steal all the oil.
2904 2018-01-08 17:57:29 PSA: I am not on steroids my back acne is from my first professional massage. The oil broke me out.
2905 2018-01-08 17:57:19 Spin it to deceive Albertans if you want. The recovery is embarrassingly poor considering today's price of oil all thanks to your job killing policies. Had you focused on the economy instead of insignificant social issues, we'd be much better off! 2019 can't come soon enough!
2906 2018-01-08 17:57:12 It's oil
2907 2018-01-08 17:57:04 Not crazy about bigots, like certain politicians, that are ok with putting white supremacists & Nazi's in the WH or kicking out entire populations regardless of the peril because of racism & ignorance.
2908 2018-01-08 17:56:58 Lovely but just in Home to find out we have no #heating oil  cold night in our house!  lighting

2910 2018-01-08 17:56:48 Getting car oil changed then gonna go home and edit a video, possibly stream later.
2911 2018-01-08 17:56:38 Remittances in Mexico outpace their oil industry. You can see that’s $$ leaving the US economy right?  Btw, these are refugees from a natural disaster in 2001.
2912 2018-01-08 17:56:15 This is fantastic! Until now, I simply use olive oil, fresh garlic, and S&P to roast veggies, but WOW! the flavor combinations in the article are making my tastebuds flutter.

2921 2018-01-08 17:54:46 All honest work deserves to be honoured. But for someone accustomed to a geologist salary to have to rely on a school bus driver's salary is very hard. Plus, this is a highly skilled and educated person. The U.S. oil and gas industry is booming. The NDs scared away our industry.
2922 2018-01-08 17:54:44 now if we could only get Trudeau and his band of idiots to do the same to the oil corporation's.
2923 2018-01-08 17:54:41 It’d be something to consider for sure. There are so few teams with surplus RHD.
2924 2018-01-08 17:54:39 I hate Kushner, but this is ridiculous.  You think Europe doesn't take into account their oil suppliers when they attack Israel? Literally everyone has financial conflicts of interest on this issue.
2925 2018-01-08 17:54:26 Yup. Well unless they pour oil in the shower
2926 2018-01-08 17:54:23 The US is Venezuela’s biggest buyer of oil the US imports very little middle eastern crude as it tends to be sour crude which makes it harder to refine, where as Venezuelan oil is sweet crude. Next

2934 2018-01-08 17:52:54 @weestie97 Oil is a globally priced commodity that varies in price. Keeping it as our own to use may help but if you remember in the 2014 the oil fell from over $100 per barrel to $25 it’s now only $48 ish. So that’s hardly a Viable Plan is it?

2939 2018-01-08 17:52:24 If @ChiefJohnKelly and McMasters and @genMattis, or Tillerson think history will be kind to them because they think they have the reins then they are wrong. Their children and grandchildren will hear the truth.actually Tillerson is still a CEO for oil...for Putin.

2942 2018-01-08 17:52:00 Some minutes ago, Israeli newspapers revealed a conversation between Yair Netanyahu, PM's son, and an oil tycoon's son where the former said his father will give $20 billions to his.
2943 2018-01-08 17:51:55 This is the same Liberal MO here in Canada, where our Liberals make promises to both sides of a dispute or conflict(like oil pipelines) and try to play it down the middle..but closer to the side with the money.

2947 2018-01-08 17:51:36 not yet...i'd like to add to oil though if we can get a bounce,..ive basically got a full position in silver already
2948 2018-01-08 17:51:23 There is always something to point to that is going to drive economy higher.  Notice that no analysts talk about "cheaper gas prices for consumers" anymore now that oil has doubled from lows and is back to $60+/barrel.
2949 2018-01-08 17:51:18 You said they are plagued by free riders. Then you said oil co are free riders. However, in spite of being the largest free riders you didn’t actually include them. 
What exactly is the plague you speak of? 
 And please include only relevant examples.

2952 2018-01-08 17:51:01 Opening up our coasts to oil drilling against the wishes of the entire country except a few oil company executives, giving massive tax breaks to billionaires, letting healthcare expire for millions of children and you spend your time golfing and passing out fake news awards?

2959 2018-01-08 17:50:08 Trump foreign policy clearly aligns with Russia's: anti-NATO, anti-EU, anti-Ukraine, anti-Paris Accord (ie pro-global oil economy), pro-Assad, pro-Sisi. All these policies reverse Obama and long-held natsec postures. Not sure what the debate is here.

2963 2018-01-08 17:49:32 Sounds good! I use the UFO oil and have seen a noticeable difference in active acne but I haven’t seen any significant improvement for the dark spots. I may splurge on the CEO serum, though. Maybe try to find a cheaper alternative in the meantime. Thanks!

2983 2018-01-08 17:47:29 That doesn't change the fact that oil is a poisonous substance to all of life. I was born & raised on the prairies & after a 20 year separation moved back 12 years ago. Not once in my 61 years have I ever seen oil seeping up out of the ground.
2984 2018-01-08 17:47:21 god forbid people mix flour yeast oil and salt in their own kitchens - this is some irredeemably doomed level stupidity

2988 2018-01-08 17:46:50 However, since oil prices are returning to there more normal levels as of a result of OPEC nations throwing in the towel in their attempt to box out the US producers. And instead focus on pushing prices up to correct for the massive amount of debt obtained in their failed attempt

2998 2018-01-08 17:45:34 According to media, Scotland is so badly run that it is not only in crisis, it's in meltdown and it's costing English taxpayers an absolute fortune every day. England might as well tell Scotland to piss off out of the UK and take their oil, whisky, water, energy & fish with them.

3002 2018-01-08 17:45:19 Getting an oil change.
I can’t wait for some guy to try to overcharge me for other random car repairs. 
3003 2018-01-08 17:45:12 That is hands down the most retarded thing you have said to me. The causes are well much relevant.
If something Trump did caused there to be a supply shortage. Say ban fracking on federal lands or say imposed sactions on a major oil exporting country, that would matter.
3004 2018-01-08 17:45:01 The Shiite and the Sunni need to have a Magna Carta moment..
This could be facilitated by sub $40 per barrel oil.. but I would go further I would put a moratorium on oil speculation for the next 10 years.

3009 2018-01-08 17:44:23 Oil (eg. from oil spills) destroys the insulating ability of fur-bearing mammals, eg. sea otters, and the water repellency of a bird's feathers. Without the ability to repel water and insulate themselves from the cold water, oiled birds and mammals will die from hypothermia.

3015 2018-01-08 17:43:46 This “10 min oil change” place must have a different version of “10 mins” than I do
3016 2018-01-08 17:43:43 Another oil spill, another environmental disaster. Another reminder that we need to find another way.

3022 2018-01-08 17:42:37 Twice now folks at other schools have tried to convince us to move games to Seymour.  It would have been really interesting to see, if they won semistate and he were within 40-50 points of Bailey if they would have gambled on the fly and moved to Lucas Oil.

3024 2018-01-08 17:42:25 @NYCMayor Mr. Mayor my school has no heat and I’m freezing. Schools should be a priority for oil delivery. This is ridiculous. School should not be allowed in a condition like this.
3025 2018-01-08 17:42:21 THIS IS A SCAM!!! Ad says CBD oil is ‘free’, you only pay for shipping. But, 2 weeks after it arrives your card is charged $89.95. They claim it’s in the ‘agreement’, but impossible to see it. No physical address. No website. FL  scam company. Find CBD near you and buy locally!!
3026 2018-01-08 17:42:20 What are we willing to give up with very limited options. We’ve finally got youth & depth on D (with some holes, that’s a given) Leon & Nuge and limited returns on Patty & Letestu. First round pick. Unless there’s a blown away trade out there I’d say stand pat until summer.
3027 2018-01-08 17:42:03 Hmmm, that'd be interesting. Toronto would be all over Klefbom, but I bet Edmonton targets someone established.

3030 2018-01-08 17:41:54 The bottom line is that we are a crude oil producing nation but lack the capacity to add value to our crude. Fuel scarcity is still the same old problem.

3036 2018-01-08 17:41:10 @michellemalkin  Need oil? Need liquified gas? Need gasoline? Need kerosene? Need diesel fuel? Need motor oil? Need asphalt? Just make sure it’s somebody else’s beach they’re pumping off of. What? Me arrogant, conceited and selfish?
3037 2018-01-08 17:41:00 Iranian oil tanker collision & fire. It had been carrying 136,000 tonnes of light oil (about 1m barrels) called condensate, an ultralight version of crude oil that evaporates easily. Oil that got into the ocean will be hard to clean up as it mixes more easily with water cf. crude
3038 2018-01-08 17:40:57 Don’t get that problem when your car uses electricity generated by solar power. I look forward to the end of oil and other fossil fuels.
3039 2018-01-08 17:40:56 Absolutely. I for one find the idea of wealth not linked to value particular food value perplexing! Everyone seems to think we can eat gold, bitcoin, oil, gems etc. We need to stimulate an agricultural revolution in #Africa as a precursor to greater progressive economic change.
3040 2018-01-08 17:40:48 @LagosTalks913 Ore u need to see with your spiritual eyes and hear wt your spiritual ears when the wise men of comedy say you go change oil
3041 2018-01-08 17:40:27 Oil up my body and wait for you like Keisha .

3046 2018-01-08 17:39:57 Oil is a forgiving agent.
3047 2018-01-08 17:39:55 my morning routine: take a viagra, an ambien, a shot of mineral oil, a shot of old crow, and then I drive to work
3048 2018-01-08 17:39:39 Hahaha!!!! The networks r burning m nt oil trying 2 figure out how 2 save their billion $ industry. I sayGo up in flames  
3049 2018-01-08 17:39:31 Stephen Harper was an autocratic ruler who had very little respect for the democratic process and even less for Canada. He represented US Oil Interests throughout his term as they mainly orchestrated his campaigns. In return he gutted Canada's environmental laws for them #Exxon
3050 2018-01-08 17:39:23 This is a good point, Rosie.

In the end, the “proof is in the pudding”, and in that respect... why doesn’t US/UK just own Iraqi & Libyan oil, if that was the purpose?!

There are a lot more intriguing/tangible goals in these efforts than “oil”...
3051 2018-01-08 17:39:20 I'm going to miss staying up late at night burning the midnight oil for finals and assignments lol
3052 2018-01-08 17:39:16 I'm starting a new oil painting and a new collage tonight. Pray for me. Oil painting sucks.

3056 2018-01-08 17:38:22 Should’ve had some hot oil ready for they asses.
3057 2018-01-08 17:38:21 Are these collisions common? Iranian oil tanker heading for South Korea (hmmm) hit by Chinese cargo ship carrying American grain. Gotta be a massive oil spill? 160 miles from shore, so nobody cares?
3058 2018-01-08 17:38:18 #PansyGraham, Mayberry's snake oil salesman's office is next door to Floyd's barber shop.
3059 2018-01-08 17:38:09 Football is (probably like lots of fields where contract workers are involved) a revolving door of people coming and going - its a body shop like Oil Contracting, IT contracting etc. He though does have a 3yr deal.  The lad is not gonna be freed cheaply.

3062 2018-01-08 17:38:04 Oh, that explains it. So because their status was temporary & you consider that it has been a long time, it's ok to kick them out & back into a dangerous situation. Glad I'm not your neighbor & hope you never have to turn to yours for help.
3063 2018-01-08 17:38:02 Ma'am oil replacement ain't the same as no oil or oil... 
Hoq can you misguide your fans???? 
@priyankachopra
3064 2018-01-08 17:37:35 Failed policies?? Is that why you got rid of CHIP, Heathcare, Consumer Protection ACT? You put that clown Pruitt in charge of the EPA & the Keystone Pipeline & just like Obama predicted, there was a massive oil spill!
3065 2018-01-08 17:37:27 I think oil is a poisonous substance.

3068 2018-01-08 17:37:09 Battleships are a thing of the past. A equipped drone can take one out. Trumps greed(oil) will be the end of him. How much petroleum wud it take for a super sized battleship to go one nautical mile?
3069 2018-01-08 17:36:32 I hate getting oil on my phone screen shit just don’t go away
3070 2018-01-08 17:36:28 Maybe petro need to be backed by a barrel of kerosene jet type instead of oil. Then airlines will accept petro
3071 2018-01-08 17:36:28 In case Repubs hadn’t noticed: OIL traded as low as $28 Obama’s last year.

It’s now $62.

THIS IS BAD FOR AMERICANS.

GOOD FOR PUTIN. THNX
3072 2018-01-08 17:36:27 SUCH A RICH COUNTRY (OIL & GAS) & THE PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING FROM THIS
3073 2018-01-08 17:36:27 Started using coconut oil on my face and it’s been working wonders
3074 2018-01-08 17:36:26 Well, it's a bit complicated, but as far as I understand it involves generating just enough smoke, aligning the mirrors properly, applying the required amount of snake oil and distributing enough coloured beads. All that takes time.
3075 2018-01-08 17:36:11 We have no oil, it's 30 outside, and they can't deliver any until Wednesday. Yay for blankets and hot water bottles 
3076 2018-01-08 17:36:01 .@JerryBrownGov calls himself “Green” while he has been ignoring San Fernando Valley residents who are still being poisoned and sick(some dead) by @socalgas at #AlisoCanyon.He is not “Green”! His sister is on the @SempraEnergy board,Browns are in the oil and Gas industry pockets!
3077 2018-01-08 17:36:01 Navier–Stokes equations are an engineering staple in the oil and gas industry. 
Now mathematicians are raining on the parade. 
But seriously, this is interesting from an academic rather than a practical point of view.
3078 2018-01-08 17:35:58 In MA state police are hired for "special details" like tree cutting by developers. Basically, its an overtime gig that just has them directing traffic, not enforcing any laws. The Env. Police have many functions, including preventing boats from dumping oil into pub. water.

3082 2018-01-08 17:35:37 What do you think oil is? Some sort of alien substance?
3083 2018-01-08 17:34:18 How can oil mark it sweeter is it an edible? 
There's a diabolic side to it. I promise you fam.
3084 2018-01-08 17:34:16 Another leftist rag of socialist propaganda suddenly seeing the silver lining to (much-skewered) increased US oil production/independence AND urging the gov't to intervene in a sovereign nation's affairs?
3085 2018-01-08 17:34:14 Sadly, I am. Industrial strength Oil of Play keeps me looking under 80.
3086 2018-01-08 17:34:10 FLASH: World Oil Price nears $70
3087 2018-01-08 17:34:06 The collapsing oil market caused job losses not the carbon tax... you oil is too expensive to sell on the global market plain and simple.
3088 2018-01-08 17:34:01 Is not that they didn't bother, there was no path for them.

3096 2018-01-08 17:33:00 I’m being responsible and getting an oil change.
3097 2018-01-08 17:32:51 The government of the United States do not care about the people of Iran, they just want more oil from the Middle East, get your bloody hands away from Iran.

3100 2018-01-08 17:32:34 I suppose you are going to sit next to that uranium dump or the oil wells and take in the breathtaking views and the indigenous wildflowers? How much money wound up in the pockets of the Republicans to get this done? 45's government is for sale to the highest bidder..2018!
3101 2018-01-08 17:32:24 I never said Liberal policy advocates free riders. I explained that there are free riders from Liberal policy to show that lack of perfection does not negate the ideas. Further, I pointed out that non-Liberal policies also create free riders, oil companies.
3102 2018-01-08 17:32:22 #oil looks heavy at this level. A target of $60.50 is reasonable short term, before it heads up again, if ever. #CL_F
3103 2018-01-08 17:32:22 But if the oil has no diabolic side to it why would the guy after smashing wouldn't want to leave her?

3105 2018-01-08 17:31:42 My favorite thing about this Oprah 2020 business is everyone conveiently forgetting that she's had Jenny "I make boogeymans out of autistic people" McCarthy and various other snake oil peddlers on her fucking show
3106 2018-01-08 17:31:38 Do you notice any oil or fluid on the floor of your #garage or #driveway? Don't ignore it!
3107 2018-01-08 17:31:25 Ministerial reshuffling is long overdue. Retain those few who re considered trustworthy & good, then park others having served even more than expected upon the cornucopia they might have realised. Is like Changing the old engine oil for a new one, to enhance high performance!
3108 2018-01-08 17:31:25 this is a good step in the right direction. Nigeria needs to make progress and an agro driven economy that is non dependent on oil is the best way to go. Nigeria needs to diversify our economy.
3109 2018-01-08 17:31:13 WTI oil at $61.66/barrel, +$0.23.
3110 2018-01-08 17:31:11 I hope for you not to make a pact with the devil, otherwise you will remember Iran from pictures and stories like all other before. USA ist THE liberator of countries rich in mineral oil. don't forget            
3111 2018-01-08 17:30:58 Oil kalau ditaro dimangkok harus sekali pakai buang lho om... coin kerokan harus disteril, tissue basah dan kering tersedia, hand sanitizer, sabun cuci tangan antiseptic, dan cuci tangannya dengan sepengetahuan client

3116 2018-01-08 17:30:38 "#Data is the new oil" is old and doesn't work. Rather, data is a renewable source of value -- need to find better analogies to characterize it as such.

3122 2018-01-08 17:30:22 Things like electric cars could be mainstream now, if not for the insane amounts if money in the oil business. Same goes for clean electricity vs coal/gas plants.

Anointed oil 
3125 2018-01-08 17:30:04 And we’ll need that space travel soon since you #oilandgas monsters are destroying the planet. Oil and gas executives are evil and perhaps in a sane world you’ll all be in prison some day! #hopeSo
3126 2018-01-08 17:29:52 Using millions of gallon of fresh water to process the tar sands is really environmentally friendly I'm sorry but if you two brain cells you can see that the path we are on is wrong and we need to make changes even if it means moving oil subsidies to alternatives.
3127 2018-01-08 17:29:50 What's keeping you from trying CBD oil
3128 2018-01-08 17:29:46 Yes - there is much more to DT's EO's, dereg's, etc. than good economy. We need to protect our Constitutions Fed and State. Not to mention drilling on our shorelines. WTH - do oil co's need more $$. What happened to alternative fuels, renewable energies?  Ooops got carried away.
3129 2018-01-08 17:29:46 You can't disagree with facts either.

Renewable energy use is increasing dramatically year on year. Sure they'll still produce oil but give it time.

By the way the new tesla is $35k not a rich man's car after all
3130 2018-01-08 17:29:45 And World Bank, also in December,ber 2017, said  it would no longer be lending money for oil and gas exploration. So why does, eg @buckscc pension fund, and many, many others, continue to invest in fossil fuel cos?
#KeepItInTheGround
3131 2018-01-08 17:29:29 Of course, these communists/KGB stooges are despicable. Did they get direct orders from Moscow ? After all, Trump is Putin's worst nightmare: strong America, energy-independent and low prices for oil are Putin's nightmares for sure.
3132 2018-01-08 17:29:15 Yes that happens what an oil war comes  to a close. The price is within the normal range.

OPEC drove the price down. If your business budgets for fuel cost to be at historical lows. Your business is stupid.
3133 2018-01-08 17:29:10 All time highs are fucking boring, gotta get some oil in my life #dab

3135 2018-01-08 17:28:56 Did you know that you can use Castor Oil to treat skin infections. Such as Acne prone skin.
3136 2018-01-08 17:28:53 Giving our protected lands to the oil companies for fracking and drilling is very far reaching. The poisoning of our water is very far reaching. The infusion of bigotry into our justice system is very far reaching. The point is #Trump , I'm not giving you kudos for doing harm.

3139 2018-01-08 17:28:40 "lower fat olive oil"
Is the bottle half-full, or is it half-empty? 
3140 2018-01-08 17:28:34 Hey oil bears, be careful when taunting the Saudis.  They can blindside you at any moment, just play it with patience being the beginning of a "bullish consensus" year
3141 2018-01-08 17:28:33 My goodness! Bill sure got schooled! If given the opportunity, I wonder if Greg would have added that the US Govt showed no interest in any Arab countries until after they became known for oil and gas.
3142 2018-01-08 17:28:28 I had an early dismissal and then an oil pipe broke that’s nice

People believe the centarians in italy eat much fat??!! Your a fool to think that. They use olive oil in such small amounts:
3148 2018-01-08 17:27:41 tell arthur to get some massage oil and make.
it. snappy. 
3149 2018-01-08 17:27:38 Patently untrue. The EU has been the slowest growing part if the planet for a long time now, especially since the oil crisis of 1974. Where's the future? Not high taxing, low growth, high unemployment Eurozone that's for sure. Germany has false advantage using others.

3154 2018-01-08 17:26:51 Yep... and MacT to a large extent... lots of promise of Bold Moves but little to show for it.  My point in all of this is that Something needs to change.  There is clearly an issue with the players buying in and maybe an issue with lack of talent... doing nothing changes nothing
3155 2018-01-08 17:26:40 What did they expect to happen, when they were supplying Germanys enemy with oil? Like when the Lusitania was sunk in WW1. It was a passenger ship! No, it was an arms bearing ship disguised as a passenger ship. Just a shame the 1200 who died weren’t in on the secret.

3159 2018-01-08 17:26:22 That's really easy for you to say from your comfy environment with the knowledge that no one is probably going to kick you back to unstable & dangerous environment. Also u assume that 200,000 ppl have been here for 17 yrs. U know how silly assumptions are.

3165 2018-01-08 17:25:45 Antivaxxers are idiots. They’re people without a high school education who google their symptoms and buy the next oil or fake remedy to heal themselves. Learn a thing or two about the immune system.
3166 2018-01-08 17:25:41 Organic canola oil is ok?

Conventional canola oil is produced using solvents, which leaves behind residues of toxic chemicals in the oil. organic, non-GMO canola oil is produced through a mechanical expeller-pressed method so solvents and hexane are not used and are not present.

3171 2018-01-08 17:25:05 No we don’t. Fuck oil in general. We can modernise our infrastructure and make investments in our future economies and environment
3172 2018-01-08 17:25:05 Just like Oklahoma has them now. Oil drilling and fracking cause them
3173 2018-01-08 17:24:40 I wish I was smart enough to change my own oil, without breaking my car
3174 2018-01-08 17:24:34 two oil workers got married,two military officers got married,if you go back to egypt.
3175 2018-01-08 17:24:20 Nope - Only roster player the Oil have who is waiver exempt is pool party.
3176 2018-01-08 17:24:12 I bought some Jamaican black castor oil yesterday how often are you suppose to put this stuff in your hair?
3177 2018-01-08 17:24:04 Everyone is panicking and trying to get home because of the weather and I just literally called and made an oil change appointment because I figured they’d have openings now 
3178 2018-01-08 17:24:03 Nigeria has nothing to show for her oil wealth.
3179 2018-01-08 17:23:45 FFS people give me tokens... i need to buy oil I have no heat!!!

3182 2018-01-08 17:23:25 I keep my friends close, my enemies closer, and my coconut oil in a cool dry place
3183 2018-01-08 17:23:22 That is not what I'm suggesting. My point is, no matter what angle they approach, they're kind of screwed, ironically enough, unless a fellow GM does them a favour and badly overpays for one of their assets.
3184 2018-01-08 17:23:13 Was the OIL cap just help upsidedown
3185 2018-01-08 17:23:12 Oil of Oregano, elderberry syrup or combo of honey, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice and cayenne pepper and in water.
3186 2018-01-08 17:22:51 I like my sauce with some oil *if you know what I mean *
3187 2018-01-08 17:22:46 Thanks very much for replying so quickly. I've ordered the coconut oil! Fingers crossed my doughnuts turn out as well as @JermLloyd's.
3188 2018-01-08 17:22:41 Had a very poorly pooch the other day, for the first time I tried the pet CBD oil from @organicCBD it worked almost instantly for Senna, perfectly happy doggo and the taste didn’t bother him one bit 
3189 2018-01-08 17:22:40 Mag sunflower oil ka te.
3190 2018-01-08 17:22:19 Wouldn't GM, Ford be all for that? And oil companies? ha

3193 2018-01-08 17:21:58 Ooooooooohhhhh. Beowulf Part 3: EVEN MORE OIL!!!!!!
3194 2018-01-08 17:21:54 Actually give up trying to make my skin better. Been using magnaminty from lush, black peel off mask, a tea tree scrub and a cucumber extract oil... and it's making my skin worse. Like what more does my skin want
3195 2018-01-08 17:21:52 I just bought a cool new conch seashell! Abraham Lincoln hid a bunch of knives in his hat! ILLUMINATI! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
3196 2018-01-08 17:21:43 i hate going by myself to get oil changes 
3197 2018-01-08 17:21:41 I know that. Ppl would rather come here to work for a season then go back home. Like most oil workers do here.

3200 2018-01-08 17:20:53 Ah yes the classic garlic and virign oil shot
3201 2018-01-08 17:20:48 Water, Coconut oil and shea butter are the keys to life. I’m convinced
3202 2018-01-08 17:20:37 hahahaha alagang castored oil pero limang beses lang ako naglagay  ayoko na e nakakatamad siguro matuto nalang ako makuntento
3203 2018-01-08 17:20:31 One day I'll learn that, while in the Service Dept. of a tractor dealership, to not poke weird looking liquids. 90% of the time it's grease, 10% it's oil. And its 100% guaranteed to get on my clothes.
3204 2018-01-08 17:20:29 I worked as a nurse trying to help keep accidents to a minimum d/t fear by oil/gas companies of lost time injuries. We need OSHA and i know that although frustrating at times, they keep safety on the front burner.
3205 2018-01-08 17:20:24 Just. Use. Coconut. Oil.
3206 2018-01-08 17:20:15 Try roasting vegetables in the oven.  Olive oil, salt/pepper.  Never was a veggie person til I started doing this.  Give it a shot.
3207 2018-01-08 17:20:09 Stir-frying uses very little oil and cooks vegetables quickly, so they keep their texture and taste. Quick easy dinner.
3208 2018-01-08 17:20:02 Also there needs to be dollars that go out. That means 93, 29, 27, 4, or 77. Those are your only dollars out options.
3209 2018-01-08 17:19:59 It's going to be Klefbom for a LW not as good as Taylor Hall, for maximum painful irony.
3210 2018-01-08 17:19:42 Stick that up your exhaust pipe, what do you mean you're electric and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
3211 2018-01-08 17:19:26 Favourite food.
Anything Indian, vegetarian or vegan. I cooked for two years in India.
Chinese salt & pepper tofu.
Mexican beans.
Polish perogi.
Pasta pasta pasta
Cook with gram flour, with water or ?milk, dip bread in it, fry in olive or coconut oil. Voila, vegan French toast!
3212 2018-01-08 17:19:20 විස්ව oil treatment එකක් කරනවද කොහෙද රැවුලට  ඔයත් එයාගෙන් අහලා එකක් කරගන්න එතකොට මූණ පුරා රැවුල වැවෙයි
3213 2018-01-08 17:19:18 Don't ever sell yourself short.  My mother took up oil painting at age 80; by the time she passed at age 92 she had sold a few pieces. (She was a French impressionist.)

3216 2018-01-08 17:18:58 Every single team is going to be holding fast until the get offered RNH now. 29’s salary will probably give teams pause.
3217 2018-01-08 17:18:56 Hello to all Lucy's students and friends is not to late to be be ready for more of this extreme cold weather, just schedule a maintenancecheck-up for the vehicle’s tires and tire pressure, battery, belts and hoses, radiator,oil, lights, brakes, exhaust system, heater/defroster.
3218 2018-01-08 17:18:56 Here's hoping they find oil off the beach at Mar-o-Lago ... we'll see if he still thinks Rigs and tankers are beautiful, or maybe he'd enjoy a bon-fire like they're havingh in the China Sea today
3219 2018-01-08 17:18:49 I love Moroccan oil!!8 usually get a Moroccan oil mousse but they were out so I got this instead, and I am happy with the hold and texture!
3220 2018-01-08 17:18:44 There was a pipe or something that broke in my school and there was oil everywhere in the hallway.
3221 2018-01-08 17:18:43 Snake oil is still oil, so I believe that would be an unlikely scenario.
3222 2018-01-08 17:18:34 Tai? Ami olive oil diye kori. Apnar recipe ta ki?
3223 2018-01-08 17:18:33 Klefbom for a RHD or a W feels like fait accompli at this point.
3224 2018-01-08 17:18:25 I would suggest you better read what Rishi Bhartrihari wrote. He said you can do impossible things like extracting oil out of sand or getting water from mirage but can't convince a fool set in his opinions. I told you let the govt intervene to review all personal laws. ALL.

3226 2018-01-08 17:18:05 He is sure on the right path! He still has some anxiety, I got him some melatonin and valerian root to try while we wait for his CBD oil to get here and it has helped so much. His thunder shirt will be here Wednesday and I believe that will help a ton too

That’s a really bad idea. Here’s why. 1/x
3231 2018-01-08 17:17:20 
3232 2018-01-08 17:17:15 Haha. Are you trying to sound educated? Cute. I have already cleared up that I was using oil cos as an example of non-liberal free riders. And you still play dumb. Perhaps not an act.
3233 2018-01-08 17:17:02 What happens to the oil on the top ?
3234 2018-01-08 17:17:01 What’s up, John? Do you have oil & gas interests in Mexico? The article talks about Russia attempting to influence their election, too.(In addition to ours). Are you still denying that?

3247 2018-01-08 17:14:45 you can buy cod liver oil in supplement form and take it, make sure you have some type of fat with it, if you're staying away from animal fats, then maybe like coconut oil.  But you can def get it from food, google has soooo many options

What you said in your book about the clean-smelling coconut oil drew me to want to try it. I'll give it a go & if it gets too expensive a habit I'll switch to lard!

3263 2018-01-08 17:13:25 That's good! Rosehip oil will help naturally moisturize and cause new skin cell turnover which will help ur skin be more bright and clear.

3268 2018-01-08 17:12:50 ...the list goes on and on. The main fact is SLS dissolves oil in a degreaser, it also dissolves oils from your skin. Important oils. 
Ever felt dry after you've used your expensive name brand shampoo or body wash? That would be why.
3269 2018-01-08 17:12:35 Not to mention drunk tanks, oil tanks, pressure tanks, oxygen tanks, military tanks and septic tanks ... 

that ‘think’ bit just can’t be good!

I've got some pixie dust we can swop.
3271 2018-01-08 17:12:13 I need a castor oil and tea tree oil asf
3272 2018-01-08 17:11:52 Realistically, the Oilers cannot quickly "non rebuild" dig out of this hole without some outright trade wins. It's not so much that a Klef (or whoever) goes out, it's that the player that comes back has to be the better player.

Chances of that happening?
3273 2018-01-08 17:11:39 Some said that about #oil and there are 1000s of years of oil reserves, plus lots not yet discovered, especially under the ocean. The #Sahara #aquifers stretch all the way West to the Atlantic (imagine size of USA) and satellite radar can only map those close to the surface.
3274 2018-01-08 17:11:33 Perfect examples being Jokinen this year & Russell last season, though $ wasn't great. As far trades go, they have such little depth that if you remove a quality asset now, they can't fill it. Look at the roster and it's limitations...it's not a pretty.
3275 2018-01-08 17:11:32 No. He'll leave that to Sessions' replacement. Semantics, people. You can't trust what a politician SAYS. Snake oil medicine show barkers...

3290 2018-01-08 17:09:46 You and the right have made climate change a partisan issue because the GOP get their talking points from big oil. Pathetic and it proves how gullible you all are.
3291 2018-01-08 17:09:41 Oprah is great but I don’t want that sleazy snake oil salesman @DrOz as the surgeon general. 

How we ask our personality leaders to promote thought leaders. Maybe campaign for someone a bit more qualified like @KamalaHarris
3292 2018-01-08 17:09:40 That is very stupid. Expanding drilling for oil and gas off our shores is not in our national best interest nor the defense of our country. More potential for coastal eco-damage is not in our best interest. Not investing in new technologies is just plain stupid
3293 2018-01-08 17:09:40 What also works is cloves, if they sell clove oil
3294 2018-01-08 17:09:38 Hey @Lowetide , isn’t this the guy you have been wanting Oil to pick up for years?

I thought you incapable of such things...
3296 2018-01-08 17:09:29 @mad___hippie antioxidant facial oil smells somehow like a chocolate orange, and I’m in love.
3297 2018-01-08 17:09:28 Home made face packs are always better than store bought ones; oil your hair at least once a week; drink a lot of water; one shouldn't spend too much money on clothes- there are always cheaper alternatives to brands which are equally nice.

3299 2018-01-08 17:09:22 Not really because if you sit and actually look at the roster, it can only be addressed in the somewhat immediate future in two ways, free agency and trade. They can certainly get value deals on the open market but those aren't always going to workout.

3313 2018-01-08 17:07:43 @LindseyGrahamSC     I saw the glorious picture of you shaking hands with oil rich RUSSIAN OLIGARCH who donated $800,000 to your superpac.  Now I know why you are bids with treasonous Trump.
3314 2018-01-08 17:07:37 Gordon ramsay : There’s so much oil in this that the US wants to invade the plate

DYING 
3315 2018-01-08 17:07:33 They'll run 99 out there for public, Keith Gretzky 99, Lowe and MacT will do the assessment, Howson and Scott the ciphering, and Katz will have his heroes making sure 97, 29 and Nurse are the new 99, 11 and 4. Christian Slater (early) Dustin Hoffman (late) play Katz in the movie.
3316 2018-01-08 17:07:32 If a GM can't find serviceable bottom-six forwards who can kill penalties, he shouldn't have a job.
3317 2018-01-08 17:07:31 Exactly. Only increased pricing will decelerate that curve and while oil is up NG is in the tank and NG plays a big role in gov revenue when it's up.
3318 2018-01-08 17:07:27 Can I ask how you are so certain of anything if we're talking about the management possibly being replaced here? How do we know what a new GM may or may not do?

Nurse is certainly having his best season but he's far from untouchable IMO.

Agree this group loves him.
3319 2018-01-08 17:07:23 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.

3321 2018-01-08 17:07:14 Tanner.exe is having software issues, sorry Jimmy he just needs an oil change.
3322 2018-01-08 17:07:13 oh no/: just be patient with it. Slowly work it. Try some oil in it
3323 2018-01-08 17:07:05 IDK, remember in 2008 and 2011 when the market was begging for hikes b/c of oil? Happens. But the Fed adjusts as the data develop. No reason to think IMO the MO will be different
3324 2018-01-08 17:07:05 Bio oil is supposed help and also if you hold camomile tea bag to it after dipping it in warm water and hold it there for a wee while every morning and night along with regular cleaning it should clear it eventually. Sounds weird but it worked with me  x
3325 2018-01-08 17:07:02 Kudos to letter writer Barnes who correctly understands offshore oil drilling issues.
3326 2018-01-08 17:06:56 Hm, maybe it’s the oil? I have a different oil this time than I did last time, seems like it smokes a little different. I’m not sure, but I’m gonna keep doing it. The positives outweigh the negatives.

3328 2018-01-08 17:06:30 I understand.
 I can’t call the Conservatives movement conservatives because there not you know, conservative. 
Dems advocate for free riders , except the largest free riders (oil). 
The real conservatives movement has nothing to do with the current GOP.
3329 2018-01-08 17:06:20 Actually our military is just fine. How about saving our planet from global warming and toxic poisoning by oil fracking and coal...oh wait, they lavish you with . Resign today.

3333 2018-01-08 17:05:55 One of the function of management function is planning. So Universities work on advanced planning which allows for late applications if you didn't apply on time. It's wrong to compare institutions of higher learning with churches it's like comparing water & oil!

3335 2018-01-08 17:05:19 #swampwatch The current WH is industry friendly but historically lobbying was total self defense. There are 93k bureaucrats in the DoE. Why?  Their mission has been to shutdown oil with more and more regulations. The overreach of gov is part of the problem!

3342 2018-01-08 17:04:29 And that's just it. Without an influx of youth coming it will never work and thus should make trading away  any 1st or 2nd round picks a complete non-starter.
3343 2018-01-08 17:04:20 The pussy tape and rolling back protection of wildlife and hibernating bears and elephants and letting oil drilling anywhere should be enough to make you not want Trump. Money money money isn’t everything honey.
3344 2018-01-08 17:04:19 My dad said a fish oil pill was stuck in this throat and I jokingly hit him in the back and he said “good job!!” and spit it out lol
3345 2018-01-08 17:04:01 no oil, yes. But also no Schengen and possible small tweaks on free movement (see Liechtenstein, Switz?). I agree SM is binary, however
3346 2018-01-08 17:04:00 So sad to see a picture of my home state, where one of the worst oil spills in America occurred, used to tell this story. Shame on you @lisamurkowski for allowing this. We Alaskans still are impacted by that spill 30 years on.
3347 2018-01-08 17:03:55 That example was meant to show their are free riders all over the system. At no time did I make the argument that the oil companies are free riders bc of liberal policies.
3348 2018-01-08 17:03:47 @HendrickAcura Advisory: Do not purchase a vehicle or get service from these guys.

3350 2018-01-08 17:03:43 That's another reason to dump Chairelli asap. If Russell's agent can get him 4x4, what is he going to give Nurse? Whatever the answer, it's wrong.

3357 2018-01-08 17:02:33 No, this group isn't. I'm just less certain about that being true if the leadership changes. In part due to the contract demand in the off-season. You can't trade Klefbom until you know if you can pay Nurse. If Nurse wants too much, that changes the equation.

3381 2018-01-08 17:01:12 They aren't trading Nurse.
3382 2018-01-08 17:01:10 Freeloaders. Look at oil subsidies and the problems these companies cause that the public pays for so that the rich can get rich. but you don't consider that free loading.
3383 2018-01-08 17:01:04 Hypothesis: a lot of this is about the 1970s oil shock.  Later elites decided that the overwhelming priority was to make sure that countries in the Middle East couldn't organize to set oil prices, effectively decided that the whole area had to be kept destabilized no matter what
3384 2018-01-08 17:00:53 If drinking more water is on your list of new year resolutions, try eliminating plastic bottles from your life.

3404 2018-01-08 16:59:35 My biggest complaint about the team for years has been the lack of a dynamic offensive player on the blueline. Any key piece dealt should have that goal in mind.

Winger depth is the easiest thing to rebuild.

They also need a new goalie in a year so I'd be on that already.
3405 2018-01-08 16:59:33 Haha, the olive oil is definitely good, but mixing oil with water makes me scared, cause oil in water spoils easily. I do actually put 2 drops of jojoba oil 4 sprays of rose water in my hand, and use that as serum for my hair

Like you pout a layer of olive oil in the pan beforehand and let it get warm before you put the eggies in
it gives a crisy edge and stuff

I have heard from some ppl that it gives them weird dreams, but I haven't noticed that for myself. I've also tried Valerian, which didn't do anything, lavender oil, which maybe helps but not noticeably
3436 2018-01-08 16:56:39 I really understand your point and it's a valid one but the bitter reality is inevitable - some big clubs, with probably oil rich money + recent success will always bully small clubs in the transfer market

3441 2018-01-08 16:56:20 Shame on you mashable, if you would have tageted other oil to promote this paid advertisement (most probably by palm oil corporations) you could have fooled me. Plan oil is used for centuries in India and old people of previous generation lived over centuries.

3443 2018-01-08 16:56:12 Why do oil changes take a wholeee hour. Like nigga put some oil in that bitch and give me my car back.
3444 2018-01-08 16:56:03 Up here getting an oil change and they’re putting air in my tire  I be too lazy so I’m grateful. Lol
3445 2018-01-08 16:56:03 I may not be able to carry on a conversation about spirituality but I can change a tire and my oil so fuck you.
3446 2018-01-08 16:56:01 Weaponizing of weather forecasts is a tactic of desperation and just old school snake oil salesmanship to peddle the ridiculously clownish Global Warming BS!
3447 2018-01-08 16:55:38 The Dems are advocating for oil interest? This is just getting ridiculous. 
3448 2018-01-08 16:55:27 Bile eh nak tukar engine oil... hmm
3449 2018-01-08 16:55:26 Yes, peddling the Secret and countless snake oil salesmen for profit is public service? Please.
3450 2018-01-08 16:55:25 They're currently in the machine with some more washing powder, white vinegar and some lavender and chamomile oil. If that doesn't work, that's definitely what I'm going to try next! 
3451 2018-01-08 16:55:16 Which makes it more likely for Peter to do
3452 2018-01-08 16:55:03 Naga chilli oil leaked in suitcase all over underwear - it’s been washed twice - not sure whether to wear or chuck.
3453 2018-01-08 16:54:57 Make a pizza base with a quarter cup of flour and water. Cook it in a frying pan with no oil or anything.  Top it with passata and 15-20 grams of cheese and cook it again same as before just to melt the cheese and it should all be under 300 depending on brands and measurements.
3454 2018-01-08 16:54:37 They can't trade their 1st round pick. If the plan is to add high-priced talent via trade & have nothing coming via the pipeline, good luck w/ that ever working w/ a salary cap.
3455 2018-01-08 16:54:34 What about your illegal treatment of Native Americans forcing a oil pipeline through their water source and women being raped, murdered, and disappeared by oil pipeline worker?
3456 2018-01-08 16:54:32 Ruutos and its 'oil spill' moisture routine 
3457 2018-01-08 16:54:24 this lady's sideeye at finding herself next to a snotball..

lady, you brought this on yourself with all that coconut oil in a public place. 

ugh, an entire academic subdiscipline in analyzing that...
3458 2018-01-08 16:54:10 This mothafcka cant fck with me , she getting mad , she getting oil-uh-ly 
3459 2018-01-08 16:53:57 Worst winger depth in the league.  Our collection of our top 3 centers is the best in the league in creating plays and scoring chances and we may not have a winger that hits 20 goals this year. Brutal
3460 2018-01-08 16:53:56 その手があったか！明日仕事から帰ったらみてみる！！！！！！！
3461 2018-01-08 16:53:52 Since free rider is a new term for you, I will give another example. Oil companies. They free ride on destroying the environment and tax payers and citizens pick up the tab. The EPA was an attempt to stop such.
3462 2018-01-08 16:53:41 There's nothing better for a player's mental preparation than the quiet pleasure of repeatedly rubbing your blade up and down with linseed oil
3463 2018-01-08 16:53:33 what coconut oil do you use?
3464 2018-01-08 16:53:33 I get some sort of weird anxiety when I go to get my oil changed and I have no clue why 
3465 2018-01-08 16:53:31 Avicenna (900A.D.) describes methods for producing essential fragrant and medicinal oil. Crushing, pressure, exposure to the light. And so the soul is also refined into a pure essence both fragrant and healing. Brokenness, exposure the Son, painful parts of my refinement.

3467 2018-01-08 16:53:05 sanctions 4 USA and it's allies have decreased Iran s production in recent years
The country has 4th largest  crude oil reserves and the 2nd largest natural gas reserves
Pakistan will survive without USA Aid all we need is control of corruption
It's only possible under IK PTI
3468 2018-01-08 16:53:04 Start by braiding. Use coconut oil and always keep it moisturized.
3469 2018-01-08 16:53:02 Well, maybe your job (if you’re a real person) is a safe one. Construction workers, oil rig folks-keep your fingers crossed! #WorstPresidentEver
3470 2018-01-08 16:52:55 DAM had a good gas development framework she developed. At a time gas was cheap and oil expensive and she just never did it. Now the private guys are looking for FDI all over the place to do it

3473 2018-01-08 16:52:41 Klefbom and RNH are the two obvious choices to move.

Personally I'd be more open to moving Draisaitl and Nurse...LD b/c I think they overpaid him (though it's not super obvious yet) and Nurse b/c he needs to be paid this summer and I don't think he takes Klefbom money.

3475 2018-01-08 16:52:16 Explain that to Standard Oil, Microsoft, and numerous other companies who make settlements with the government for wrongs perpetrated against the public. Their existence is under laws passed by governments, and subject thereto.

3477 2018-01-08 16:52:10 U had zero idea about this until fox told u , last week.

3480 2018-01-08 16:51:56 Has the campaign started?  We know for a fact the NDP lied or withheld the truth.  Now they take credit for a rebound in “dirty oil” that they have done everything possible to destroy.  Is that their claim to fame?
3481 2018-01-08 16:51:47 Tillerson making the Oil deals w/ Pruitt's help.

Miller and Conway ghostwriting the racist and personal attacks.
3482 2018-01-08 16:51:36 PC should start building a refinery now to take advantage of the new oil rigs.  It's gonna happen folks!
3483 2018-01-08 16:51:32 Oh a side note, I wanna start taking fish oil again. I wanna see how well it helps my knees/hips cause as is, I can only do box squats and even then my knees sometimes don’t cooperate. Anyone have recommendations on brands/dosages? I don’t care about the burps.
3484 2018-01-08 16:51:30 Don't fire Trump till we get some offshore oil wells.  Jobs and Money for all!

3489 2018-01-08 16:51:04 hot oil treatments! natural, unrefined, cold pressed oils! I use a bunch and mix them together, warm it up and leave in as long as possible.

3492 2018-01-08 16:50:23 So does anybody think that Fish Oil pills / supplements actually help/work?
3493 2018-01-08 16:50:20 My boyfriend woke up at 7am on his day off to take me to work so I could leave my car at his house so he could change the oil himself because my oil was at 5%...and if that’s not a real man idk what is
3494 2018-01-08 16:50:20 ...unless the lies lead to support of an illegal invasion of a sovereign nation, Iraq, that posed NO threat to the US, paving the way for the killing of millions of innocent people in the name of oil. Then you pursue lies. #JudithMiller
3495 2018-01-08 16:50:10 This coconut oil doing miracles to my hair
3496 2018-01-08 16:49:58 America is superpower (and so is Israel) because of Saudi commitment to sell oil in dollars (in exchange for protection of monarchy / Al Saud) hence Saudi-America-Israel axis
3497 2018-01-08 16:49:54 I’d be a lot more upset with this oil change taking almost an hour and a half if it wasn’t free
3498 2018-01-08 16:49:42 Thirdly, we were talking about the tax revenue raised on sale of whisky, but by the 'barrel' reference you either thought we were talking oil, or you're buying whisky in bulk?
3499 2018-01-08 16:49:34 Mebbe it was working for so long he didn't oil it, it overheated and... y'know...
3500 2018-01-08 16:49:27 I also say, though, oily over the course of the day is common if we’re indoors all day due to the recycled air and heat lights create, making very small amounts of sweat which pushes oil to he surface as well

3509 2018-01-08 16:48:39 Oil is be a factor however Trump has taken some steps to absorb the bounce. Solar and electric cars/trucks will be a big player by 2020. As long as @Tesla and @elonmusk can stay mostly on course.
3510 2018-01-08 16:48:35 HAHAHAHAHAHA, BEARD OIL WHAT HAHAHAHA I think you can cancel the order xD Tell them it was a mistake or something :D
3511 2018-01-08 16:48:34 My Husband takes it and it has been a life changer! He’s still sick but it has helped him with some of his symptoms causing a better quality of life! He uses kB pure essentials organic CBD oil! It took 15 days to see slight difference and 30 days to see a huge improvement.
3512 2018-01-08 16:48:32 Name the top three kick ass decisions #Oprah2020 has ever made. Can you hear #Oprah ever saying say she will cut off money to Palestine or food and oil from NKorea. 
3513 2018-01-08 16:48:23 Next time you get an oil change, just buy the oil and filter yourself. The oil change should be around $7-10 dollars. ya welcome.

3515 2018-01-08 16:48:19 @LouisianaGov Metaphor in Bible verse shows us that we're in for the worst. Verses numbered matching the days of coal and oil tell us we'll have more whirlwinds with eyes, and have to fix the soil.
3516 2018-01-08 16:48:17 @realDonaldTrump Please don't forget about #Water & #Wastewater when u are coming up w/your plans 4 improving the agriculture industry in rural America. We need 2 advocate 4 the operators who work in this field. The human species needs H20 2 survive. Not broadband, oil, or roads.

3552 2018-01-08 16:44:09 Trevor you're a lie machine just like oil. You should abandon oil and its sinking ship of lies. Again, your logic is literally saying that because (in your incorrect opinion) clean products don't exist, that they can't exist. You're making 2 key mistakes but stay ignorant of that
3553 2018-01-08 16:44:05 I Hate Going To Get My Oil Changed Or Anything That Has Something To Do With A Place Full Of Men  All They Do Is Flirt And Hound You ! Like Damn I Just Came For My Car Bruh !

3560 2018-01-08 16:43:01 Hey #MAGA - ites, you voted for a supposed #populist to take back your country. #Trump is clearly not acting #president. So, regardless of what you voted for, you GOT a military/corporate government in the form of two retired Generals Kelly and Mattis, and oil guy Rex Tillerson.

3562 2018-01-08 16:42:25 Extracting oil from beneath the oceans, the water weight above, have no corrolation whatsoever pertaining to this cause and effect scenario? I find that rather odd...
3563 2018-01-08 16:42:14 I cut up the cauliflower in smaller florets. Take whole bulb of garlic cut off the top -add to pan Mix up a 1/4 c olive oil, salt, pepper, and 1 tsp or so of cumin. Pour over it all. Mix. Bake at 400 for 20-40 minutes. w/bulb push out cloves eat w/cauliflower.
3564 2018-01-08 16:42:05 I think the “She doesn’t have experience!” people are dead wrong.  She is vastly more qualified than 2008 Obama.  However, she is the reason we have The Secret, Dr Oz, Dr Phil, and all kinds of other snake oil bullshit.  We can’t forget that.
3565 2018-01-08 16:42:03 It's sad that you'd stay home because of DACA and ignore tax cuts, regulation cuts, all the oil exploration, ISIS defeated and everything that comes in the next 3 years. If he was King, I'd agree. Alas, he has a Congress to deal with and we have to face reality.
3566 2018-01-08 16:42:03 "October 15, 1987, Iran hit the American-owned (and Liberian-flagged) supertanker, the Sungari, with a Silkworm missile off Kuwait's main Mina Al Ahmadi oil port. The next morning Iran hit another ship, the U.S.-flagged MV Sea Isle City, with another Silkworm missile." -wikipedia
3567 2018-01-08 16:42:01 If the oilers get dahlin it was written from the start ,like when they got the golden ticket. They want to win no one is tanking ,this is bad for actual crap teams in the bottom 5 because the oil have a legitimate shot at getting another 1st overall pick. Which is halarious
3568 2018-01-08 16:41:55 Very beautiful. 
What will you do if Trump wants to build a wall of questionable value in front of that view or allow random oil/gas exploration and fracking? 
You appreciate your environment; have consideration for others.

3578 2018-01-08 16:41:00 PRESIDENT BUSH, IS IT TRUE THAT THE WAR IN IRAQ IS REALLY ALL ABOUT OIL?

3583 2018-01-08 16:39:47 Any solid fry oil will do, so if palm oil is easier/cheaper to find, that’s great too.
3584 2018-01-08 16:39:40 Very cool! My husband works offshore on an oil rig and before that he worked in west Texas on land rigs. 
3585 2018-01-08 16:39:38 3連休終わりとか暦上のバグ
3586 2018-01-08 16:39:37  That was what I was thinking, til they said "secure your future husband". I don't trust that oil again.
3587 2018-01-08 16:39:36 I  wish there were enough other industries that paid well enough destroying Oceans, public lands, killing off wildlife, making  people sick due to pollution etc. and future damage and cost was not  more important than the current need to make a good living in boom and bust oil.
3588 2018-01-08 16:39:36 These 2 are just water and oil  this relationship is forced man. #SkeemSaam aekhona Kat a tlhale die ding
3589 2018-01-08 16:39:30 Shit be feeling like I'm slipping on oil 
3590 2018-01-08 16:39:30 because the oil from cars gets all over the roads when its not raining 
and when it rain....
does roads get extra slippery..?
3591 2018-01-08 16:39:18 I do! I would love them to allow offshore drilling. Make my gas cheaper. Listen as a society we're not off oil yet, we're on our way. While we still use oil it should be as affordable as possible.
3592 2018-01-08 16:39:15 うぇーい！楽しみ( ᐛ)
3593 2018-01-08 16:39:11 No Sephora doesn’t carry then elf is only available at the drugstore or on online they kinda feel like wax paper they have little black bead looking things in that absorbs the oil off of your face!
3594 2018-01-08 16:39:11 Getting oil changed today! It's a #tcoiday!
3595 2018-01-08 16:39:10 原生生物時代に一体どんなドラマが！？
3596 2018-01-08 16:39:08 I didn't say anything about an oil spill in the ocean. I clearly said "tailing pond". You're about as uneducated on this topic as anyone I've seen in a long long time. Glad you're bowing out because you can only goosestep down the Lieberstraub the way you've been programmed to do
3597 2018-01-08 16:39:03 "Man, having fur would be a hassle - just imagine the shedding."

Bitch, our asses leaves skin flakes, oil, and eyelashes all over the place anyway.
3598 2018-01-08 16:39:02 Unfortunately some do. Most public oil and gas producers and service companies did that from Q4/14 thru Q1/16. Unlike govt they can’t do it as long though.
3599 2018-01-08 16:39:01 I’ve never tried that before! Somebody told me Peppermint oil but it does nothing for me 
3600 2018-01-08 16:39:00 As if I’ve only just started using coconut oil on my face
3601 2018-01-08 16:38:55 Now that it’s finally above freezing I can do the following:

Get gas
Get my car washed
Get an oil change
Get air in all 4 of my tires
 

3602 2018-01-08 16:38:49 Tea tree oil is a lifesaver
3603 2018-01-08 16:38:46 Y’all think the roads are slippery, my sister sprayed coconut oil in our bathroom and I’ve been having near wipeouts for the past 2 weeks
3604 2018-01-08 16:38:28 how many oil spills is it going to take

3609 2018-01-08 16:37:43 I need some more caster oil 
3610 2018-01-08 16:37:42 Send the replacement now itself or else it's not possible to store the items which are soaked in oil for three days .. it's not even feasible to ask such a thing from your side and not even logical ... I regret ordering from grofers ... in future will definitely not order
3611 2018-01-08 16:37:40 This is the most generous use of the word "fatter" I have seen in a while.  Aren't we talking about average 1500-4200 or so per YEAR?  Well, Apple alone will see additional 43.6 BILLIONNNNNN dollars over last year's profits.  That's one corperation. Also banks and oil companies..
3612 2018-01-08 16:37:37 ooopppsie...US grain vessel "collides" with Iranian oil tanker providing clandestine fuel supply to NORKs.  Iranian dudes seem to be missing after it explodes in massive fire.  Source: @foxnews

3619 2018-01-08 16:37:04 We're better versed that you I'd dare say. And also know that it's worth billions as well - you think snake oil salesmen are in it for the good of humanity? Nope - they're in it for the money.
3620 2018-01-08 16:36:51 Just another normal Monday for indicators of the 2018 global economy: Gold flat, oil flat, stocks flat, and, er... Bitcoin and Ripple both down 12%.
3621 2018-01-08 16:36:50 My first time bringing my car for an oil change 
3622 2018-01-08 16:36:46 O&G ni oil n gas ke?
3623 2018-01-08 16:36:38 I just gave Yan a fish oil tab & she said "it's like a suppository this one"
3624 2018-01-08 16:36:34 Brilliant, thanks so much. And to check - plain oil - would that be vegetable oil?

3630 2018-01-08 16:36:10 I just got the Jeep . I go to jiffy lube to get a oil change and they say you need this, this , this , this like ASS my nigga hold on!
3631 2018-01-08 16:35:57 Sir, looks like the cheese having vegetable oil. Better avoid this. You can go for normal cheese.

Just a suggestion.
3632 2018-01-08 16:35:54 Dad took my car in for an oil change & Larry Green gave me back my car with no oil LOL how

3634 2018-01-08 16:35:46 please provide meaningful critique to a snake oil salesman. you can’t use the obvious facts “it does not work” and “nobody uses it”. go.
3635 2018-01-08 16:35:42 Good question! Terry Tempest Wiliams tried this, I believe, in Utah. I THINK (not sure) the feds come after you in some form if you don't show motion to put the land to oil-n-gas use. You can of course argue about the rightness of that...
3636 2018-01-08 16:35:42 My ear was really hurting but then I put the magical oil that the lady gave me, the pain just went away. Wtf

3639 2018-01-08 16:35:13 I'd spend my life as an @LFC fan in league two before I'd take pride in being a team subsidized by oligarchs or oil men. We've a lot to be proud of. Our owners are part of that.

3641 2018-01-08 16:35:10 I totally get the feeling. I have dealt with insomnia for most of my life and it really does suck. I have found a way though to be able to sleep at least some nights. I got an essential oil diffuser and a few different essential oil scents one of them being a sleep one. It helps.
3642 2018-01-08 16:35:05 Going to be sorry when eating seventeen varieties of tea tree oil with breakfast and Dr Oz is surgeon general.  King Bear just say.
3643 2018-01-08 16:35:04 -The sounds onions make when they drop into hot oil to fry
-Pressing French Press coffee
-Licking the batter of a spoon after you've finished with it
-When someone else makes you breakfast
3644 2018-01-08 16:35:04 To be fair, the first day of rain is the most dangerous, due to it dislodging the oil on the road, but still. Drivers be crazy yo.
3645 2018-01-08 16:34:56 my hair looks so ew cause of the coconut oil I'll never put this much in my hair ever again
3646 2018-01-08 16:34:56 The reason trump feels he is a genius is because he fraudwd about global warming to drill for oil and uses Christianity as his muse
3647 2018-01-08 16:34:53 Can you explain this easy process immigrants are so reluctant to follow for permanent residency?
3648 2018-01-08 16:34:48 I think you can do some kind of brownie with coconut oil.
3649 2018-01-08 16:34:48 That has even been utterly debunked by...wait for it...the National Grid! That’s an oil industry scaremongering tactic! Many EV owners are charging from their own solar! This area grows every week! Far from causing issues EV’s will help the grid with VTG tech!!

3651 2018-01-08 16:34:38 unbelievable I've nearly missed this......and now Africa Oil have put someone on the BoD at #ECO. Amasing firms like HUR have been toiling to get recognition from majors but #ECO have them battering down their door!
3652 2018-01-08 16:34:37 There is nothing inherently market or price based about the world financial system today. The US dollar has a monopoly on oil pricing & reserve & the biggest econ. by PPP (China) fixes it's currency to the USD by govt force

3654 2018-01-08 16:33:56 The two are so locked stepped because of Syria and oil that I see no separation cracks as of yet, let the protests continue and deepen then we will see something, but it will be via spetsnaz, their elite of the elite unit is largely based right now in Damascus
3655 2018-01-08 16:33:51 Aight I already do wash it every other day lol. If I wash it everyday it produces enough oil to cook fries in!!
So I need a silky pillow case, coconut oil and some good dry shampoo. Which dry shampoo do you recommended??
3656 2018-01-08 16:33:50 What I need is a vat of warmed coconut oil into which I can just submerge my body up to the neck, problem solved.
3657 2018-01-08 16:33:49 vitamin E oil
3658 2018-01-08 16:33:45 Me and picking up a oil is apparently a bad mix. Couldn’t get things flowing today. They had to get union pacific maintenance over to me. Guy came out and has no idea about any of this. He made a couple calls moved a couple valves and finally got things flowing.
3659 2018-01-08 16:33:24 Trump knows there is global warming. He is mentallyill risking lives is abusive wanting to use violence rather than admit he frauded to drill oil
3660 2018-01-08 16:33:19 Learning how to paint sunlight and shade is one of the formative skills of oil painting.
3661 2018-01-08 16:33:17 Only 1% of oil&gas CEOs are female: "Where I work, women are like oxygen: less and less as you go up." #oilandgas #genderinequality
3662 2018-01-08 16:33:14 Oils! Oils! Oils! Peppermint, theives, oregano, copiaba and many more!! Oil them up!
3663 2018-01-08 16:33:10 In that case you are forgiven, but I would have liked to have seen a little gun oil perhaps. #Dobetternexttime 
3664 2018-01-08 16:33:05 (2 of 2) Regs require operators to maintain "accurate" records of maintenance, repairs of flowlines and crude oil lines. State has "authority to inspect these records."
3665 2018-01-08 16:32:55 Boles, not in support of raising GPT. Oil gas is No 1 contributor to state via all taxes.

3673 2018-01-08 16:31:33 Not to please constituents; North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, Maryland, Oregon, and California explicitly oppose drilling off their coasts.  This is a blatant gift to the oil companies that have bankrolled his campaign and staffed his administration.

3675 2018-01-08 16:31:31 Don't think you have to limit yourself to coconut oil for your hair. Olive and avocado oils are actually very moisturizing oils if you are prone to dryness..especially used together 
3676 2018-01-08 16:31:19 I didn’t specify a tense or a club. All the major trophies in European football have been won recently by clubs defeating oil clubs with this method.
3677 2018-01-08 16:31:11 Veganism is about opposing animal exploitation, not avoiding allergens or contaminants. No additional suffering is caused because my fries were possibly fried in the same oil.
3678 2018-01-08 16:31:05 Would you support an increase in GPT? Murdock - it’s a crime we’ve dropped it down to 2% when it was once 7%. Oil companies need to pay their fare share.
3679 2018-01-08 16:31:03 There's no permanent status to apply for. There's no path to citizenship for them under the current law. You're attacking them for not doing something they can't do under the law.

3690 2018-01-08 16:30:35 Alaska!! That’s sF we going to tear down Alaska! There is not going to be a safe place left in America bc of oil. I’m not a fan of drilling in Alaska lol. Min wage is 11 dollars in a place that costs much more to live.  Green energy is what we still need to start going with

3692 2018-01-08 16:30:28 You mean shoe stores dont want to drill for oil too? Only energy companies? That wouldnt make sense. Wonder if that will make less abundance of energy and drive up cost.
3693 2018-01-08 16:30:28 明日から学校やんけ
3694 2018-01-08 16:30:25 And who else would WANT to drill for oil besides energy companies? Duh!

3697 2018-01-08 16:30:19 Wtf. I've made stew a dozen times and now I never want to again. Why are you adding oil/butter? Slow cooking meat helps breakdown all the fats...that's half the point. If you are doing veggie then I will STFU. Goodluck. :)
3698 2018-01-08 16:30:16 You know that joke where people are like "duct tape fixes everything"? That's how I am about rosehip oil. Literally tell me anything wrong and my ass will be like "Rub some rosehip oil on it."

3712 2018-01-08 16:28:33 Truly is good news for Alberta.  Good thing oil prices have gone up & stabilized to lead the recovery. They were responsible for the downturn & now are responsible for the upturn. Same rollercoaster as the last 60 years. Also % increase is always higher when we were so far down.
3713 2018-01-08 16:28:08 E&P names have been weak for the last few days while oil trades sideways, big $ still doesn't want to own this sector.

3727 2018-01-08 16:26:21 That’s why. You need to stop washing your hair everyday. Start using dry shampoo before you go to bed then when you wake up brush it out. The less you wash your hair the less oil your hair produces. I have fine hair &  I go at least four days without washing it & you can’t tell.
3728 2018-01-08 16:26:18 If you have faith enough to pray for a healing havefaith enough todo what scripture said go be anointed with oil and prayed for bythe church

3738 2018-01-08 16:25:36 I saw "dry patches" and had to share. My daughter has very sensitive skin to anything scented and also eczema patches on her back and stomach.

3787 2018-01-08 16:19:50 Which means that you have less money to spend on other products and their prices fall as you now value oil more and averages are unchanged.

3802 2018-01-08 16:18:44 This is refined and probably only has 30% actual coconut oil. The products needs to say it's organic, raw and unfiltered. That's why it's not working

3866 2018-01-08 16:12:15 The growth of Royal Dutch Shell’s oil and gas operations in the next decade will depend on shale production, its chief executive has said, in the latest sign of western energy groups pinning their hopes for expansion on those “unconventional” resources.
3867 2018-01-08 16:12:12 BREAKING: #MARLBOROUGH An oil truck has rolled over in a driveway on South Road and I'm told at least 1,000 gallons of oil has spilled. Could be a considerable environmental mess. Stay with #NBCCT for updates.

3871 2018-01-08 16:11:54 Lol, whatever suits your narrative. Venezuela got broke because they were stupid enough to depend completely on oil revenue. It has nothing to do with immigrants. Immigrants make economies grow, not collapse. Pick up a book and you can read it for yourself.
3872 2018-01-08 16:11:51 I've been thinking about this Iran situation. No doubt Saudi Arabia & US oil interest is behind this in order to cut oil supply. The new petro-yuan scares these people.
These oil barrons will try to hold onto power by any means.

3905 2018-01-08 16:09:07 @ba777one CBD, the cannabinoid can temporarily neutralize the activity of P450 enzymes & thus alter the way drugs are metabolized inside the body. If you have MTHFR mutation, or other unknown mutations, your body on CBD oil will worsen the deficits present by genetic mutations.

3926 2018-01-08 16:06:08 It’s for a Polish oil company. the logo was done probably beginning of 2000. Supposed to represent an eagle, which is on a Polish coat of arms.

One of the strongest national brands that still runs the same logo since launch.

As for me here goes:
Cooking oil

3934 2018-01-08 16:05:21 Also shes bit smokey and splattering small oil deposits everywhere, bit out carb intake, little bit onto back of front mudguard, little out of most orifice's tbh, she got huge amounts of compression on kick start and shes smoking a tad more than I've seen before, needs a run? 
3935 2018-01-08 16:05:13 Nation defense?! They’re not talking about building anti-missile battery along the cost it’s oil rigs. But republicans like to say “defense” “support the troops” and other catch phrases so the sheep go along with it for fear of being labeled anti-American. #wellplayed
3936 2018-01-08 16:05:09 Seems this oil does actually work, surely giving it a try!
3937 2018-01-08 16:05:08 I just started using both CBD oil and beard oil and neither of them seem to do anything. Starting to wonder if I don't have the bottles mixed up.

3947 2018-01-08 16:03:42 Alaska is the only sanctuary for the earth left. Please do not build roads, drill for oil or destroy the oceans and waterways around it with your greed. Americans want preservation of our lands.
3948 2018-01-08 16:03:40 I’ve been tweeting the same. Oprah’s a faddist who’s pushed snake oil salesmen Dr Phil & Dr Oz. She falls for too many fads & pushes religiosity. I’ve heard her question how anyone could be atheist. This level of deification of anyone is dangerous. Its too cult-like for me.

3954 2018-01-08 16:03:08 Just great . An Iranian oil tanker that collided with a Chinese freight ship , in the Chinese sea , is still on fire and may dump 1 million gallons into sea . Imagine that was off the coast where you live . #KeepItInTheGround
3955 2018-01-08 16:03:06 Increased my Sbet long on Pressure Tech. One of my riskier stocks so just a small increase & I'm not keen on averaging down. With the increase in the oil price I'm hoping business in the oil and gas sector is improving for them. It seemed a well run company before oil price drop

4000 2018-01-08 15:58:33 I need less taxation on Long Island New York, property taxes, income taxes, fuel taxes, electricity, heating oil, village taxes, ...we were the forgotten citizens in the tax "reduction plan" ! @seanhannity
4001 2018-01-08 15:58:29 All kinds of "he said-she said" going on as far as how many trucks are on the road and who is getting what for oil and when. It's a gong show.

4011 2018-01-08 15:57:25 yes, if you can! Depending on why you included it, you can describe things like the artist/style/mood/subject - whatever is the relevant reason it's attached to the tweet. ex: oil painting of a dog demonstrating Impasto painting style

4033 2018-01-08 15:55:01 I’ve been putting oil on my cuticles once or twice a day because they get so bad and dry in the winter, but I think it’s helping them grow faster?? Maybe I’m just imagining that’s why
4034 2018-01-08 15:54:57 Gotta get my oil changed
4035 2018-01-08 15:54:55 @SkyNewsThomas I have just seen your piece about the Sanchi, I have a few points that will help with the story. Myself and 2 of my employees are former oil tanker masters and have alot of experience

4043 2018-01-08 15:53:56 Good move, I like the fact that the intention is for it to be an actual currency...very difficult to speculate since it's price directly against oil..the one thing I think  they need to setup properly is exchanges, so people can in Venezuela can use it easier.
4044 2018-01-08 15:53:50 Sitting and waiting for an oil change to be done on my car is the single most annoying thing I have to do... like once a year... and yet... 
4045 2018-01-08 15:53:45 身長の話になると「きっとおだ先生は(いろんなとこが)でっかい女の人がすきなんだろうな」っておもっちゃう
4046 2018-01-08 15:53:43 Exactly, as those who remember history should know. Let me guess: aside from the Winter Olympics, #NorthKorea will want oil and food as a precondition for moving forward...
4047 2018-01-08 15:53:26 So deeply saddened by your loss...

I also lost my 3year old Son in 2014/03/Sep.. he got burned by hot cooking oil, when i got the call i was in cape town performing.. i tried to rush home (pretoria) but it was too late to even see him...

Its still hurts, Hang in there bro 
4048 2018-01-08 15:53:21 There is going to be a new kind of fracking going on in 2018 & it doesn't involve oil. It's the fracturing of what's left of the R party into smaller more contentious bits. More Bannon's to follow as the black hole enlarges.
4049 2018-01-08 15:53:11 When in the shower, & hair is dripping wet, mix a dab of a deep conditioner or leave in conditioner, a little olive oil or avocado oil-mix- apply to wet hair- squeeze excess of water out, wrap a cotton T-shirt to dry hair. Do not blow dry it- better to do in the evening.

4051 2018-01-08 15:53:02 Getting my first oil change in 3 years I can't believe my car is still running
4052 2018-01-08 15:52:34 I imagine that AF1 is just a grand old white man suck-fest with Sarah Sanders watching from the sidelines with a bag of porkrinds and backup baby oil.

4056 2018-01-08 15:51:37 and with talks of yuen-centered oil contracts shedding light sometime this year, crypto only opens up more avenues to grow more distant from the USD

4058 2018-01-08 15:51:31 Obviously you’re a bot. Hard to believe that a Native American, whose was country was stolen by illegal immigrants, would support a man who makes fun of Native Americans and supports taking their land for oil companies.

4061 2018-01-08 15:51:28 I heard all of the Trump Towers are built on massive oil reserves. They should come down so we can drill there
4062 2018-01-08 15:51:28 Shout out to vitamin c serum and teetree oil for helping my skin survive through this cold ass weather.
4063 2018-01-08 15:51:27 Turkana is blessed to have both oil and an underground fresh water lake that can water Africa for decades. It is unacceptable that people from this region are still relying on relief food when the water was discovered more than 7yrs ago

4065 2018-01-08 15:51:07 No matter what the oil companies say. There will be leaks and it called "oil spills". The oil companies only spend at best half the cost of clean up.  It talks 30 years for the area to recover. Alaska is still trying clean up Valdez spill.
4066 2018-01-08 15:50:45 Your Dr. Oz is a big one...that guy is the penultimate snake oil salesman. Oprah is smart...how does she buy in to him? Baffles me.
4067 2018-01-08 15:50:38 if Oprah is president she will absolutely subscribe to some insane snake oil neoliberal economic theory

4081 2018-01-08 15:48:46 As an artist and lover of NL, this captivated me until I saw JC Roy (who's paintings I admire) polluting by squeezing out oil paint onto a rock to be used as a palette. What disregard for NL's incredible landscape. Shame.

4084 2018-01-08 15:47:58 What are you jumping the gun? I have not asked anyone to film or take pictures of oil installations.

Having said that, your talk about taking pictures or filming of oil installations being illegal is figment of your imagination.

4088 2018-01-08 15:47:49 That is what the Keynesians tried to argue in the 70s and why inflation ratcheted up to just under 30% and then they realised the relationship was the other way round. If MD had not been increased then no inflation and just a restructuring of prices,higher oil & the same average.

4106 2018-01-08 15:45:44 Chopped broccoli. Thinly sliced red onion. Grape tomatoes. Equal parts seasoned rice vinegar and olive oil for the dressing. Let it macerate for a few hours then top with toasted slivered almonds to serve. Pretty, crunchy, and not at all potting-soil-like.

4125 2018-01-08 15:44:04 this is schoolboy speech freedom of speech should not be a big deal is everyone 's right  the real issue all  trying to ignore is wasting people's money in the middle east oil revenue should benefit all needy in Iran not keep buying arms and keep defending the middle east policy
4126 2018-01-08 15:43:59 Pure tea tree oil! For pimples & dark spots/scars. Put it on a q tip and put it right on the spot. Or if you use black soap, you can melt it into a liquid and put a few drops of the oil in there. Both work for face & body
4127 2018-01-08 15:43:56 Yep. Let's drill baby drill! Let that oil spill! We don't need clean air or water, safe roads, buildings or bridges.

4142 2018-01-08 15:42:24 Obviously not, that'd be like gas prices dropping once oil goes below $100/bbl.
4143 2018-01-08 15:42:16 LOL. I guess I am lucky then. I have switched back to lux soap cos I don't see what Dettol is doing for me for over 5 years and I started using coconut oil after so much pressure from the wife to start using cream

Also, she pedals snake oil &  is responsible for promoting anti-vax. In other ways she's a great lady & very inspiring.
If she wants the job, then run for Congress first and get some experience.

4148 2018-01-08 15:41:55 It depends on the food. I tossed my potato in a little olive oil before I cooked it, and sometimes I give it a spritz of cooking spray, but that’s it.

4199 2018-01-08 15:34:58 Why do oil changes be expensive 
4200 2018-01-08 15:34:42 Apples and oranges, my friend. Ukraine is a democracy run by elected officials with meagre salaries, not royalties who own unlimited oil and gas resources. Corruption in Ukraine and Russia is on the next level.

4223 2018-01-08 15:32:05 The initial tweet drew strong assertion from the ER alone. I was just arguing on that basis. 

Does the depreciation of RM signifying weakening economy? No. The data overwhelmingly points at the direction of crude oil prices. 

Prices rose, hence RM appreciation.

4299 2018-01-08 15:22:18 We need to rent a car, but there isn’t a single rental car available in this whole area. The oil boom out here is fucking insanity.
4300 2018-01-08 15:22:18 I need coffees and food. I have an appointment to get my oil changed at 1
4301 2018-01-08 15:22:15 & I don’t defend Saudi. Unfortunately modern society depends on oil, but I don’t believe we shd invade or boycot Saudi as the damage wld be too great

4306 2018-01-08 15:21:35 I wish GOP would take care of children’s healthcare like they take care of giving tax breaks to oil companies.
4307 2018-01-08 15:21:35 I would recommend I Love Juicy as it is packed with fresh fruit to deeply cleanse and clarify hair. It is full of enzymes that help break down excess sebum (oil) on the scalp, leaving hair looking and feeling fresh and clean :) ~ Bec

4331 2018-01-08 15:18:47 I pulled up to Honda for an oil change and the guy told me my bronzer looked good, I told my dad that the guy complemented my makeup and my dad texted me back and said “I’ll beat him up”
4332 2018-01-08 15:18:32 Drip - much has happened this weekend and mostly unnoticed as Betsy strips student loan forgiveness programs and fracking (oil drilling) is now moving closer to a reality off the coast off the US East Coast
4333 2018-01-08 15:18:29 Cooking the meat without oil seems to be working fine \o/

I'm making wraps <3
4334 2018-01-08 15:18:25 Too many things to be worried about in this country... Spiritually tho, guys take girls destiny to make money while girls too put oil in their pussy to chain a rich guy down... Nobody is safe mehnnn, some we've not heard off still going unnoticed
4335 2018-01-08 15:18:14 Trump do you even know how much a gallon of gas cost? Could you change the oil in your car? I do not think you understand the life of “We the People” so stop with your complaining about how you are so smart. Smart People ke know when to shut up. Have a great Genius day.
4336 2018-01-08 15:18:05 You are correct. But, and this is a big but, the STH is known to the Oil, and has their ear. If a number came forward and voiced concerns,
4337 2018-01-08 15:17:58 These things should not be part of trade deals. If you don’t like a countries record don’t negotiate trade deals with them. Why does Trudeau government continue 2import Saudi oil? We all know about their lack of human rights. For the record lots of Canadians can’t stand Trudeau.
4338 2018-01-08 15:17:54 That what you get when @AMNH accepts tainted money from the Koch Bros. #asswipes Our beloved institutions need restraint from the $$$ being thrown at them from the crazy right wing, especially from the climate change deniers & oil barons, which are the Koch Bros.
4339 2018-01-08 15:17:31 thanks you too! I follow the Oil, not because I'm a genius or know more than anyone else. I'm just a hockey nut that enjoys the game. I have players I like, some are...meh, and some I dislike, but to demand firings, inappropriate messages to players and family... no thanks...
4340 2018-01-08 15:17:28 So sorry Liz  it makes its even worse when you think you have to explain and can’t. I went through that with my migraines. Have you ever looked into essential oils? I’m hearing miracle stories from the people in my oil groups on fb.
4341 2018-01-08 15:17:25 Belize is a tax haven; they don’t really rely on oil for income.

Pro:
- really good
- absorbs paints well
- watercolors are vivid

Con:
- also absorbs oil from fingers

4401 2018-01-08 15:11:14 What's happened since "Ontario gas stations were fined $2M for price fixing"?
Nothing!
Just recently, the prices at the pumps went up .12 cents, two days before the price per barrel of oil, came down.
4402 2018-01-08 15:10:52 Glad to hear they're burning the midnight oil hunting down each law and regulation designed to protect human beings, human rights, and the Constitution. Hope they're also trying to kill Amendments 1 and 3-10, and to shore up 2.

4529 2018-01-08 14:57:06 Tp abis itu bersih sih. Saran ku kamu coba pake yg almond dulu aja itu khusus buat jerawatkan? Nanti kalo udah mulus baru tambahin oil lain  dikasih jarak ya! Kalo misal timbul jerawat diliat kalo jerawatnya ditempat yg emang sering timbul berarti purging lanjut aja

4566 2018-01-08 14:52:49 Especially donate.  Snake oil is not free.
4567 2018-01-08 14:52:40 Hello! Yes, after shampooing I've been doing a mix that I would describe as 'a *bit of apple cider vinegar plus *some water and, if you fancy, a *bit of coconut oil'. Leave on for three minutes and rinse. I would describe the experience as very experimental!
4568 2018-01-08 14:52:28 Baba, u no sabi prepare am.
The right amount of oil, the right amount of aja-azu and the right amount of smoked fish. 
You'll lick plate.
4569 2018-01-08 14:52:23 Oreos r NOT vegan as they contain palm oil. Eating any product containing Palm oil defeats the object. Come on peta
4570 2018-01-08 14:52:16 This cold has sucked every bit of moisture out of my skin smh baby oil and cocoa butter is not enough
4571 2018-01-08 14:52:14 Toothache so bad I feel like drilling it out myself.  One of the many things I regret about my addiction is not looking after my teeth. Where's the clove oil! I'm actually thinking of chewing on some garlic! Ahhhhhh
4572 2018-01-08 14:52:00 Unfortunately, @NatResources refuses to defend our public lands except as oil and gas commodities. Never has an administration attacked our public lands like this. It's a disgrace. Cheers to @patagonia for standing up for all of us!
4573 2018-01-08 14:52:00 @jimcramer Have you wondered if the reason the Saudis are now letting #SaudiAramco go public is because their oil is running out? Maybe the reduced output is not to manipulate the price, but because they cannot produce any more? #paranoia #PeakOil ?
4574 2018-01-08 14:51:59 Girls, if you have to be on make up let it be expensive. I just saw a girl using palm oil as foundation and still saying she is on makeup..........what a terrible view  
4575 2018-01-08 14:51:51 The oil companies were quite aware of Global Warming in the 1960s. Even Tillerson has been recording acknowledging that it is a fact.
4576 2018-01-08 14:51:51 ไปคอนเอสเจกะกุม่ะละ เดะกุพาไปคอนอซ5555555555
4577 2018-01-08 14:51:47 Because it's inconvenient and it creates profit reductions for oil companies. Maybe some global instability as we move away from dirty energy production.

But that's all I got.

4581 2018-01-08 14:51:26 Is that oil based medicine? Looks like fish oil. If ita normal medicine, potong in small pcs for easy swallow. It's very hard to feed them & kinda painful imo. You have to open the mouth then hold the jaw & put the medicine on the back of their tongue & somewhat push it down

4593 2018-01-08 14:49:14 Which of these things would a Russian stooge do?

1. Open offshore domestic drilling
2. Keystone Pipeline
3. Russian sanctions
4. Selling arms to Ukraine
5. None. Russia depends on expensive oil and wants to crush dissent in the Ukraine.

Educate yourself, sheep.

4597 2018-01-08 14:48:59 How arrogant can one country be? Apparently arrogant enough to think that putting a lid on a volcano (nuclear stock) is enough to keep the prices down for any longer than 2 years, maximum. China is already outpacing us recently, so the market doesn't care if the US loves oil.
4598 2018-01-08 14:48:55 I was sort of loving the cold and yesterday I was shoveling a path to our oil tanks and something pulled in my back. Today I am writing dark, dark comics with icepacks on my skin dreaming of Hawaii.
4599 2018-01-08 14:48:48 I'm sincerely asking you. Since you are pretty sure Iraq oil is being stolen by #iran. My belief is UK USA Israel are stealing Iraqi oil. Most oil fields in Iraq are heavily guarded by western coalition armed forces. Pipeline to Israel was to pass thru Syria. Not anymore!
4600 2018-01-08 14:48:43 If I ever make another batch of concentrate I wanna try clarified butter or coconut oil as the base with butter you can make toasts and such if you don't scorch it too much and coconut oil is great for morning coffee or merging in other food stuffs.

4668 2018-01-08 14:39:40 Try Tea Tree Oil
For athlete's foot, reach for tea tree oil, an extract of the leaves of the tree. It appears to have antiseptic properties and may work as well as or better than over-the-counter antifungal products. Apply a light coating of the oil to affected areas.

4743 2018-01-08 14:28:49 Remember when a gas station had two gas pumps and someone pumped your gas, washed your windshield, checked your oil, Gone. Now there are 20 gas pumps and a cashier inside mainly selling lotto tickets and you use a credit card at the pump.
4744 2018-01-08 14:28:42 these oil people need to come the fuck on. IM COLD!
4745 2018-01-08 14:28:34 Good guess. Actually it's more like butter. It's a vegetable oil spread, but we can call it butter for our purposes today. ;)

4747 2018-01-08 14:28:31 Look what Obama did for the Native Americans who protested. Remember last year? Nothing. It will go on as long as they know there is oil. No one stops it since the beginning. Ever.
4748 2018-01-08 14:28:31 Oh fed gov also paid some of the intl oil companies dues that KRG failed to at one point. Paid for contracts they didn't sign. What in return? 0% contribution to budget. No oil sharing. Sabotage Iraqi economy by reducing federal customs fees.
4749 2018-01-08 14:28:18 Tony told me in order to get rid of this pimple on my nose i need to drink lots of water and put tea tree oil on it hmmm i wonder who taught him that

4760 2018-01-08 14:27:05 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
4761 2018-01-08 14:26:59 I was tipsy off my wine and dipped my fave acrylic brush into black oil paint.  and didn’t realize it was oil until days later. My brush is ruined.

4773 2018-01-08 14:25:43 Were they imposed 12 years ago? I'm not defending Baghdad; they r as corrupt as Erbil. But, they waited 12 yrs; put up with oil smuggling, PKK support, IMF/WB loans under Iraq guarantee & 0% contribution to federal budget while enjoying 17% of Basra oil. Doesn't sound fair.
4774 2018-01-08 14:25:40 I suppose the exhaust gas / oil temp & tune has more impact on failure. Either way as long as its in warranty no need to worry too much ;)

4868 2018-01-08 14:12:45 Sir Alex didn’t compete against 6 potential challengers in the league. He didn’t compete against these oil rich clubs in the CL. To measure a big club’s target from more than 5 years ago is pointless and baseless. If this Pep team were around his era he’d have retired earlier.

4878 2018-01-08 14:11:10 A rise in oil prices will not cause inflation unless there is an accommodating rise in monetary demand so you can argue that cost push pressure forced the BofE to expand M, but the cause of inflation is still the monetary expansion

4900 2018-01-08 14:08:15 I think the painting medium that's the most difficult for me is oil because my dad wasn't really into those so I grew up with watercolour and acrylics instead... but oils are closer to the art I do digitally so I'm really interested in it

4908 2018-01-08 14:07:30 Nah. And prosperous is subjective anyway. They have resources like oil. But again not being able to have a stable GDP amongst other things is what's troubling most African countries. This is a convo that needs more than twitter characters lol.

5008 2018-01-08 13:56:14 What you should check what is the price of Pms in other oil producing countries?  For private refineries to be profitable then government should deregulate it.  No one place price on bottle water or soft drinks. Why Pms?

5051 2018-01-08 13:50:46 Guys. Would you really want Oprah in charge of oil deals with Iran, for example? Oprah's great; one good (or a history of many good) speech makes not a President. Let Oprah be Oprah.
5052 2018-01-08 13:50:42 Yep pretty good, That would also explain the unpacking earth of today, If you work in the oil finding industry you know 100% continental drift is a load of academic b/s. The poles have already shifted about 7% by my calculations, Note farmers had to realign solar panels on
5053 2018-01-08 13:50:18 It doesn't make it bad either. Canadian acquisitions increase when the price of oil drops, Canadian companies can operate for lower costs. Using the term "exodus" implies money is leaving AB when it's not, it's being reinvested back into AB by Canadian companies

The traditional poorest, “non-participators” in Iraq’s stunning oil wealth have always been Kurds in the north, Shiites in the south.  That continues.
Have we changed anything or just exchanged Maliki for  Saddam Hussein?
5083 2018-01-08 13:46:32 Agreed! Unfortunately, much like military spending, human warehousing has become a large part of the American economic system, especially privatized facilities. We are addicted to oil, guns and jails.

5085 2018-01-08 13:46:05 We have to face facts - we are not funded with oil money so need to operate as any business and balance the books. It’s up to (corrupt) FIFA to force ‘big’ clubs to not run at huge billion pounds losses. Unless that happens, nothing will change. We are probably over achieving!

5179 2018-01-08 13:31:43 Unfortunately, the Trump administration wants to get rid of national parks. The skyrocketing entrance fee costs in 2018 will make it virtually impossible for most working families to share in the parks. All part of the plan to deconstruct the administrative state for oil!

5184 2018-01-08 13:31:07 You are painting with a broad brush. I have voted for Republicans. My dislike for Trump has little to do with politics.  It stems from him being a racist, a womanizer, a snake oil salesman, a ripoff artist and a con man. 

And I did not say I live in NYC.

What happens if public funds- proceeds from crude oil sales is stolen by elected officials (alleged leaders)? #corruptionNG. There is poverty in the land. Hence the out flock of Nigerian immigrants to Europe via Libya seeking greener pastures.

5234 2018-01-08 13:22:05 They regulate the price through production. The Saudis continued to ramp up production not long ago to undermine the US shale oil efforts. All these trades that you talk about are people adding their cut to the price without adding value

And you seem to be making the argument that everything you /like/ is socialism. Sargon's Law is still true.

5301 2018-01-08 13:11:40 I think the key here is that journalists at news organizations have a democratic obligation to cover certain beats for tax paying citizens. Covering the leagues is probably parallel to covering other corporations. There’s a duty but do we get great coverage of oil? Insurance?

5335 2018-01-08 13:06:29 This doesn't make any sense. The analyst says because Canada has trouble getting its oil to market our fuel price will rise.  I think the message is fuel prices go up for whatever reason they feel like.

5413 2018-01-08 12:52:55 Hydraulic oil can get as high as 450°  if there is a leak near the exhaust manifolds  it could be a very bad day  Fires in heavy equipment is a common thing  &where they work the FD couldn't get to it in time
5414 2018-01-08 12:52:49 They are working very hard to do what the real mission is, taking over the world as they have been taught. Oil is the insentive.
5415 2018-01-08 12:52:36 I usually get small breakouts via make-up wearing and poor diet. So last night after using my @Sephora extractor to safely remove whiteheads.

5418 2018-01-08 12:51:52 That’s not true! Yes oil does have to do with it but as someone who came from the Middle East I can assure you that the only reason that the US has not be taken over is the strong Military. I know that from my learnings while living there and personal experience.
5419 2018-01-08 12:51:48 Corbyns model economy is having an oil rich nation that relied on one export to fuel it's economy that crashed because the market got flooded with oil? Somehow I don't think so.

5450 2018-01-08 12:47:25 Drilling for oil off the continental United States is taking the country in the wrong direction. Exxon Valdez, Gulf of Mexico oil rig disaster, & recent Iranian oil tanker fire are examples of irreparable harm to our environment. Ignorant Trump Administration! Stop the carnage.
5451 2018-01-08 12:47:10 Oil is useful for so many purposes that it is indeed a shame to burn it in power plants.  However, that is the situation we have gotten ourselves into, here in New England, despite being right next door to the Marcellus shale, and having shut down nuclear plants.

5456 2018-01-08 12:46:10 Exactly the price of oil is at the whim of OPEC,  the US needs cheap oil so it started drilling shale to drive down the price.

5468 2018-01-08 12:44:35 Because Saudi and US shale oil is much cheaper to extract...check the price of crude, Canadian oil isn't worth the expense at this price.

5488 2018-01-08 12:40:58 Think about tree cover and seed type. Black oil sunflower is a favourite among over wintering birds. They like to retreat into cover while husking their treasure. Do you have lots of tree cover nearby. Some times it may take a couple weeks for discovery.

5490 2018-01-08 12:40:25 I'd imagine so. Given drill next month which could further imcrease production near term we should see this trading towards £100m mc given cash, no debt, strong production, low opex and increasing oil / gas price #RPT

5539 2018-01-08 12:32:24 me after touching my nose: um did I just dip my fingers into some naturei pure olive oil bc wow i could fry 24 eggs with the amount of oil i harvested
5540 2018-01-08 12:32:15 Also funny thing I learned (the hard way) not all essential oils should be put on yo skin. And if u mistakenly place an oil on yourself that starts to sting DONT put water on it to try and wash it off. It jus burns more.

5548 2018-01-08 12:31:13 My major worry for 2019 is the disappointment called Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa. It's sad that an oil producing state like delta state still can't meet up with salary payment. Until December last year Okowa was owing salaries and I know this trend will continue again this year...

5687 2018-01-08 12:08:05 @thismorning shut Gino up. He is talking bollocks. He is using olive oil which is good until heated past a certain temp then becomes a rancid and bad fat. He is not educated enough. Stop giving out incorrect information ffs

5737 2018-01-08 11:58:43 It’s intriguing to learn that big oil industries were to blame for hiding true effects of lead poisoning the public.... and history repeats itself now with CO2 and carbon emissions. They hire scientists with a purchased opinion to contradict the reality of the facts.

5756 2018-01-08 11:54:26 yes, oil price won't rise in over a night, but it won't even fall all of a sudden. Stability is the key here, I believe. Besides, one can trade cross assets bitOIL to bitUSD for instant stable cashout in a new economy world via a decentralised exchange. #BitShares

5786 2018-01-08 11:48:50 It will definitely, but it’s for a period of time until we pay a bit of our debts and then they can increase the consumer wealth and get back to how we used to be! It’s effecting everyone, but this is the only way to do it unless the oil get back to it regular price!

5839 2018-01-08 11:36:12 I wasn’t surprised because I’d done my research & knew where Saddam’s oil money went -even for the UN auth’d sales that were supposed to benefit his people. Also, in the Kurdish region where I was, I knew how he felt about them - pretty obvious considering he used WMD’s on them.

5849 2018-01-08 11:34:19 News flash, global warming was changed to climate change to make it more amorphous and thus impossible to criticize. Who can ever disprove the climate is changing? Trust in someone besides business-major Al Gore who sold his channel to the oil barons of Qatar.
5850 2018-01-08 11:33:18 Except of course that the Venezuelan government are sabotaging it through mismanagement and seizures. Meanwhile, we're saving the money from the oil. It's not perfect, but we're not crazy enough to start printing money. And we currently have a Conservative government.

5914 2018-01-08 11:21:38 Claiming that putting oil wells up and down every coast is for National Security is insane. You are mining your own coast with targets that each one can cause an environmental disaster if ruptured.

5948 2018-01-08 11:13:47 I am not here to troll. I have a question. The US uses natural resources at an unsustainable rate. The Trump administration seems intent on rolling back environmental protections and boosting oil drilling. Does this concern you at all?
5949 2018-01-08 11:13:42 Thats the way, hold your people back and keep them in the dark ages. Does history teach you nothing? Change will come despite your efforts to stop it. All the oil rich countries are run for the few not the many. Long overdue for change!

5985 2018-01-08 11:07:17 Reading comments from Neo liberal politicians outraged that Trump is going to further expand oil production  

Where was their #resistance when Obama expanded oil production by 88%?

5986 2018-01-08 11:06:47 Bless him, that's very funny albeit daft what they were doing with it. It kind of reminds me slightly of a story about an Asda store (Wales I think) where they couldn't restock shelves of Vegetable Oil quick enough, was getting used by some diesel car owners instead of diesel.

5988 2018-01-08 11:06:10 Yeah, Scotland with its wealth of resources (sustainable energy sources, oil, farming, fishing, whisky, water......) is uniquely incapable in the world. How could it ever become independent with such millstones round it’s neck?
5989 2018-01-08 11:05:47 I use the Scottish Governments figures, odd you think they would lie about oil tax revenues given their political objectives.

6492 2018-01-08 09:17:06 Please be ensured that this does not affect the quality, shelf life or flavour in any way.

6547 2018-01-08 09:07:15 Yarn is made from pre & post-consumer waste. Post-consumer waste we recover is spent fish farming nets, ghostnets & carpets. Benefits: we get rid of waste that would otherwise be thrown in landfills & nature & save precious raw material using waste instead of oil to produce yarn
6548 2018-01-08 09:07:08 @BBCr4today 2 years of extreme views of what @lsebrexitvote might lead too. Journalists lazily putting oil on the fire. What of the possibility it is just a distraction which will not affect common men/women that much. Sterling rate fluctuations counter possible tarrifs etc

6573 2018-01-08 09:04:06 Oil stable on lower U.S. rig count, but below recent highs: SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Monday, supported by a slight decline in the number of U.S. rigs drilling for new production, with crude holding just below near three-year highs reached last week.
6574 2018-01-08 09:03:32 So that tanker leaks it's oil into the ocean causing great environmental damage...solar gives zero risk of leaking toxins into the environment or causing great environmental damage...so again WHY IS donnie SAVING FOSSIL FUELS....could it be corporations giving him payoffs? Hmm
6575 2018-01-08 09:03:01 There are fears of an environmental disaster in the East China Sea as a tanker continues to leak oil two days after colliding with a cargo ship.

6639 2018-01-08 08:47:12 @YourViewTVC oil curse in Nig. is such that when crude oil price is down, pms price falls. This is bad for d Govt but good for Nigerians. On the reverse, high crude price is good for the Govt but burdens the people. Way out is produce locally and save the people.

6643 2018-01-08 08:46:53 @TVCconnect For as long as we continue to import fuel, this problem will remain perennial. It's sardonic and lugubrious that even after 50yrs of oil discovery, Nigeria still imports fuel. #YourViewTVC

Anointing with oil is very much scriptural.
6960 2018-01-08 07:35:50 I heard
Gaddaffi wants to return currency to gold specially in selling the oil they produce and "someone" didn't agree to that so they got him killed!

6969 2018-01-08 07:34:38 I don’t think you’re making the right decisions. You should be taking larger steps towards renewable energy. Jobs created would include education and application.

1 8oz block of soften cream cheese
1/4 cup of olive oil

I forgot to add flaxseed...

7119 2018-01-08 07:00:30 Hurray for future pollution? oceans and pristine wildlife areas for oil drilling, air and water pollution levels of the 1970's coming soon to a town near you. all in the name of profit, brought to you by the dimwit criminal @GOP and dotard @realDonaldTrump

7128 2018-01-08 06:58:06 You just rip yours off?? Lol I see alot of stuff online about it possibly affecting your engine etc? Just looked and engine line and oil area  underneath are fully exposed
7129 2018-01-08 06:57:53 No surprise. 
7130 2018-01-08 06:57:18 Used to like Lush, can't bear the smells anymore. I tend to use either coconut oil or olive oil, carefully rubbed in and left for an hour or two or overnight. Doesn't need to be rubbed on the scalp, just the hair. Washes out easily.

7134 2018-01-08 06:56:07 Sorry folks, but i’ve always been suspicious of Oprah. Too much “virtue” while promoting snake oil.
7135 2018-01-08 06:55:52 Ponds the blue bottle or coconut oil
7136 2018-01-08 06:55:37 Oil is no longer the world's most valuable resource. #Data is & social media companies, search engines, governments, banks, etc are collecting it every minute of every day. How can we protect our digital identities? With #blockchaintechnology #blockchain #cryptocurrency #XVG
7137 2018-01-08 06:55:30 The age of oil is over. These efforts to press pipeline construction are in hopes of delaying the end of the era!

7140 2018-01-08 06:54:44 Too right! I've heard horror stories about it being accidentally used as a deep frying oil back in the day...
7141 2018-01-08 06:54:38 I'm about to start using watercolours but they intimidate me. Previously an oil paint user. Any tips for a beginner?
7142 2018-01-08 06:53:46 New understanding of the "dangerous phenomenon" of unusually large ocean waves could help inform the design of oil platforms and other offshore

7144 2018-01-08 06:53:31 Spoiler alert:  Do you know what a snake oil salesman current man in White House is?  Get real
7145 2018-01-08 06:53:23 Miller is a robot. His handlers will oil him after he returns from the show and rewind the tape in case there will be another interview where he can robotically spew his comments again.
7146 2018-01-08 06:53:14 Every time I’m super thirsty or have like extreme cotton mouth I just put a few drops of lemon essential oil on ma tongue and i feel so much better after

7149 2018-01-08 06:52:50 My birth control has made my skin so dry that I have to bathe in straight up coconut oil every day and use 4 different moisturizers just to even be able to wear makeup 
7150 2018-01-08 06:52:48 The poor snake oil salesman defeated himself. It was marvelous. Absolutely marvelous to see him breakdown like that.

7153 2018-01-08 06:51:29 EPA's Pruitt & Interior's Zinke are probably the canonical examples with Trump. Both are set on strip-mining our national parks & drilling for oil along every coastal state & Zinke wants to turn his entire Dept. into some kind of Gestapo. Very disturbing.

新どらっへくん見れなかったのは個人的に超残念。
7156 2018-01-08 06:51:15 And all this drilling for oil is so unnecessary. We have a surplus of oil . Much of this oil will b shipped overseas as in the XLpipeline oil which will b refined in Texas and then   shipped to China. I'm afraid these great magnificent whales will b only in History books soon
7157 2018-01-08 06:51:04 Sliideeee some oil to me #thechi
7158 2018-01-08 06:50:55 Israel is a light for the nations of the world to follow into the future, if they could stop being addicted to oil...
7159 2018-01-08 06:50:35 I put waay too much oil on my legs.
7160 2018-01-08 06:50:22 I could fucking drink olive oil.
7161 2018-01-08 06:50:22 Well, they are exporting the oil and don't have many refineries ... probably !!
7162 2018-01-08 06:50:05 Yes, and both have ethics problems that are all about money and sensationalism.  Dr Oz promoting snake oil, and Dr Phil providing access to illegal drugs and alcohol to his addict guests. Sick.

7166 2018-01-08 06:49:45 ahh haha oil clogs up pores, bacteria can then flourish in them and boom you've got zits and what not; maybe use the oil on your hair? just a bit though loll
7167 2018-01-08 06:49:41 Thanks all. I think the first thing is to establish if indeed oil revenue was recorded for Togo and if it is not a misclassification. Then, investigations can kick: who bought the oil, who sold it, whre, when etc?

7174 2018-01-08 06:48:52 clearly better now. Fabregas was shit hot during his Arsenal days though tbf. Coutinho more dynamic/pace/versatile. Difference w/ PSG is there is no oil state bankrolling their largesse.

7181 2018-01-08 06:47:42 @bentitolowan TBH I have NEVER believed in a 'lesson plan'. Snake oil! Learning experiences count! Relationships matter.
7182 2018-01-08 06:47:25 To understand oil, corporations and US imperialism.. People need to understand who is within US sphere of influence and those on outside. Geopolitics is nuanced. It's not like anything the US corporate media garish cartoon simplicity interpretation. It's much more interesting.

7199 2018-01-08 06:44:16 And please create a blotting powder and setting powder...that would be EPIC. I know you’d make the most amazing, super oil absorbing, blurring formula ever. I need that to happen. 
7200 2018-01-08 06:43:27 @alnicbd Do you only make salves or do you also make creams and oils? I have a CBD salve from the set I got at Christmas but I haven't tried it yet. Only the cream and oil.
7201 2018-01-08 06:43:09 What world are you living in?  China, India and Eastern Europe are expanding their use of coal and fossil fuels.  Din't you hear Trump's speech to Poland, his goal is to undercut the Russian energy industry and sell our coal and oil to Poland and rest of eastern Europe.
7202 2018-01-08 06:43:09 Any idea how puss found the oil? Need to make sure puss doesn't do it again.

7230 2018-01-08 06:36:45 Would the stock market be breaking records, has it been coming out of a depression?  And the thoughts kicking the oil industry into high gear drilling. Unemployment stay the same because as usual for this time of year, many company/stores lay off employees after Christmas.

7234 2018-01-08 06:35:39 @realDonaldTrump pay attention!  Oil can cause a lot of damage!  No coastal drilling!  Oil leaks will happen!
7235 2018-01-08 06:35:33 It's why I can't live there in the winters, that & I don't have the money it would take to keep me safe enough to live there, even in town. Whether it's wood, fuel oil, propane... it costs a lot of cash to be sure you're warm enough to live. Add in gas, groceries, 4 wheel drive?
7236 2018-01-08 06:35:24 Didn’t Armie Hammer just play a statutory rapist in a movie that was played as romance?
7237 2018-01-08 06:35:17 Maybe use “if” not “when” because you’re implying with certainty that oil will make a new high in the next few days. And we all know you’re always wrong stupid git #WTI #oott
7238 2018-01-08 06:35:08 I would love to know how skincare products that have mineral oil as a main ingredient can claim to be “non comedogenic” when that shit literally clogs pores and aggravates acne

7249 2018-01-08 06:33:57 Same problem as tanks on land. The water gets inside the tank, under the oil, super heats, turns to steam. The pressure then causes a massive explosion.
7250 2018-01-08 06:33:57 Not watching the Globes. Got rid of cable over 20 years ago. No need for indoctrination. Trying to figure out where oil will go in the next three months. Too much cash sloshing around the world hoping for a place to hide. Makes predicting the future very difficult. Don't like it.
7251 2018-01-08 06:33:54 Hey, if @realDonaldTrump has his way, that could be an oil tanker burning off Florida's east coast; let's say Miami.

7258 2018-01-08 06:32:54 And now oil is going up you complain that's it's causing fuel increase. Giving excuses why fuel price should go up under PMB. Double talk

7268 2018-01-08 06:31:41 Maybe the sales of holy water and anointing oil is a bit slow. Few months back South African pastor Mbhoro announced he had visited heaven and photographs were for sale at R5 000 each. Of course he denied it when there was an outcry.

7273 2018-01-08 06:31:13 But you got to see the bigger picture too, oil prices were at their highest ( except for early 2009), we have to be precocious with any economical plan that's too welfare centric, don't a Venezuela 2.0 happening in Malaysia

7305 2018-01-08 06:23:38 @City1051#CityPress Why do these oil committees keep fooling themselves? Which refinaries do they want to fix in 18months? Such deception
7306 2018-01-08 06:23:38 OK, then I'd have to be convinced that the oil doesn't accentuate the insulin response of the real foods.

7342 2018-01-08 06:17:56 if my calculations are correct putting off getting my oil changed any longer will result in my car exploding; therefore I will continue to put off getting my oil changed until I explode and no longer have to worry about getting my oil changed!
7343 2018-01-08 06:17:38 A high oil LCHF diet? I admit the study didn't show anyone chugging oil, but I find that a bit of a stretch to save the theory. Also a suspiciously convenient one.

7400 2018-01-08 06:05:30 Yup wee need to sue the federal and provincial governments for stopping Canadian  prosperity!!
It truly is a crime to buy oil from another country because a province or prime minister won’t let a natural resource be transported!

7402 2018-01-08 06:04:22 I just took a shower, exfoliated, and deep conditioned my hair too. Did my skin care routine after. Rubbed body oil on all my scars and put lotion on. It’s been a fuckin bit since I’ve taken care of myself like this 
7403 2018-01-08 06:04:00 I thought my skin was leaking oil and literally cut my bra open! OIL PACKETS!
7404 2018-01-08 06:03:54 I can’t find my coconut oil.. I’m bout to cry 
7405 2018-01-08 06:03:52 Don't you know OIL is more important than people? What is wrong with you? Get your priorities straight!

7413 2018-01-08 06:02:27 I use way too much coconut oil on my face but a bitch skin ain’t never dry 
7414 2018-01-08 06:02:13 I also realised that I can never spend the night at someone’s place and shower and change without bringing a whole ass bag. I need to put on lotion and baby oil and y’all don’t even believe in lotion and the need to moisturise and I’m trés distresst at this realisation.
7415 2018-01-08 06:01:57 She might be inspirational, but our leaders in our new day on the horizon need to be critical thinkers. Oprah fell too easily for emotional stories and charming snake oil salesmen.

Love Oprah if you want, but elect a hardworking politician.
7416 2018-01-08 06:01:55 okay so that night time recovery oil is working amazingly.

7427 2018-01-08 06:00:01 China oil spill sparks fears of environmental disaster. France surrenders.
7428 2018-01-08 05:59:58 i was in love with Nyx Micellar water! it’s not oil based so it feels fresh

7430 2018-01-08 05:59:22 Much of the gulf coast is still suffering from the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010. There is no safe way to drill oil.
7431 2018-01-08 05:59:17 But it's those big oil cans of it with the warning to do one a day max and he butt chugs like 6
7432 2018-01-08 05:59:10 Has anyone used Bio Oil before? If so is it worth it for dry skin, stretch marks and scars?
7433 2018-01-08 05:58:54 I know it takes a lot of soapy water to wash the hydraulic oil out of everything when the rad springs a leak...
7434 2018-01-08 05:58:44 Ya heffa you ain't tell me! I wanted some body oil I'll give ya the $8
7435 2018-01-08 05:58:35 You don't need a license to spell license correctly
7436 2018-01-08 05:58:09 This oil is called wedding cake and it's a lil spicy I love it
7437 2018-01-08 05:57:57 Gas not necessarily less GHG than oil -- depends on CH4 leakage rate and pathway (ethane better, methanol worse).  We (w/ @mlaz_sei ) working on a briefing paper now on methanol route to olefins / plastics...
7438 2018-01-08 05:57:53 Yes, same with Hitler- why go into Poland, why protect those Jews in Poland. There was planty of Chlorine and also Sarin and it had been used. Just tweet chemical weapons Kurds Saddam. Next you will say it was oil when the oil price had dived.
7439 2018-01-08 05:57:41 Our cat was the same way. The vet said she was healthy. They suggested a humidifier with an oil that’s calming for cats. She passed from unrelated issues. Never got a chance to try it. They also talked about anxiety meds for her if the humidifier thing didn’t work.
7440 2018-01-08 05:57:33 Sex is cool but you ever had a thick woman rub castor oil into your beard?
7441 2018-01-08 05:57:02 In 2018 were putting castor oil on our eyelashes instead of falsies
7442 2018-01-08 05:56:54 I'm sick and tired of 'private sector to the rescue' type candidates who think they can fix government. You live in NY; I'm in California. Schwarzenegger sold us this snake oil and it was disastrous 

We make a mistake when we elevate business know-how as a prereq for office.
7443 2018-01-08 05:56:33 We got the best oil drills, the best oil pipes, Merica.
7444 2018-01-08 05:56:30 Hey if you don't fuck with an essential oil in a diffuser/humidifier... nothing major but please consider revisiting since it's the absolute jam
7445 2018-01-08 05:56:30 こちらこそありがとｱﾝﾄﾞお疲れ様！
またいずれね！
7446 2018-01-08 05:56:28 Unless you live close to a place that's had a terrible oil spill. I live in Fl, I seen the damage from a spill in the ocean. You just see the positives and for what so we can export all this oil to other countries. While we still buy oil from other countries.
7447 2018-01-08 05:56:16 And I mix it with face oil cause of my dry skin and I’m loving it

7449 2018-01-08 05:55:31 Sleepwalking/talking Clint is a real trip. He woke me up ranting about e-coli, went and ate a piece of pizza, came back to bed and apologized and then told me to start digging for oil.
7450 2018-01-08 05:55:28 It's funny but god, this kind of snake oil stuff is so predatory. I know when average folks (esp folks who are sick/chronically ill) are desperate to get healthy they'll try a lot of strange things. It's like the apricot pits at health food stores sold for consumption.
7451 2018-01-08 05:55:20 she’s too smart for her own good , she was pretend doing my hair today & got some invisible hair stuff and said it was coconut oil

7455 2018-01-08 05:54:49 Rescue crews struggle to tame China oil tanker fire; crew still missing BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - Rescue crews scrambled to bring a blaze on an Iranian oil tanker off China's east coast under control on Monday as fire raged for a second day following a collision with a grain…
7456 2018-01-08 05:54:43 While I agree it can be used as a currency, it is more like how oil can be used as a currency. It may be more effecient than fiat in some cases, it should be primarily used as a protocol to build decentralized applications.
7457 2018-01-08 05:54:37 We fear the oil
7458 2018-01-08 05:54:33 BTW, in supporting capitalism, YOU are advocating for mass murder. Millions overseas in imperialist wars for oil, opoids, minerals...homelessness due to illegal foreclosure, something still going strong...record income inequality, people can't afford their medicine...good work.
7459 2018-01-08 05:54:33 #nocoincidences just like BP Oil in "Rubicon".
7460 2018-01-08 05:53:47 Look at that...all these doctors 4 just one person? If this was d attitude of our doctors 4d lives of ordinary Nigerians in their care, our hospitals would earn Nigeria more revenue than crude oil.
7461 2018-01-08 05:53:10 Have you tried putting coconut oil?!? From what I've heard it's helps with a lot of things especially stretch marks

7466 2018-01-08 05:52:05 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
7467 2018-01-08 05:51:50 Right now we subsidize coal oil and gas 38x more than renewables. @algore speaks live at @hammer_museum
7468 2018-01-08 05:51:38 I only got olive oil
7469 2018-01-08 05:51:20 Driving my truck home and boom lost all oil pressure. Night Train can you please give me a break for once. Thank god for my little brother
7470 2018-01-08 05:51:20 Technically yes, but it's really dumb misunderstandings on the part of the restaurants like saying hot chips are GF but then you find out they were cooked in the same oil as battered food, meaning the chips are contaminated. 
7471 2018-01-08 05:51:16 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
7472 2018-01-08 05:51:01 LMFAO oil it

7474 2018-01-08 05:50:29 Listen I'm all for oil and plastic. It wont be around forever and its destroying our planet. So we should be investing in renewable energy and biodegradable materials to replace plastic and other things that don't deteriorate because its filling up landfills and the ocean.

7483 2018-01-08 05:48:27 Just my arsenal of oils i have in my room  i usually use olive oil, sweet almond oil, tea tree oil (like 2-5 drops), peppermint oil (like 2-5 drops), and vitamin e oil.

You don’t have to use that many or that combination though. I’ve seen recipes including so many diff ones.
7484 2018-01-08 05:48:25 ゆばくんありがとね。ルガルガンの写真取れなかったの残念だけど次の機会にとっておきます

7490 2018-01-08 05:47:34 Natural cures for the win!
My upper right arm has been killing me.  Instead of popping a pill I put a little bit of eucalyptus oil on my left hand and rubbed it all over my arm. Now it's tingling and warm and it feels so good. Ibuprofen could never match that :)

7492 2018-01-08 05:47:25 Heya Steve! Yup, too bad we got binned by the comp.. What to do.. I've not been gettin much luck getting a job back in Oil & Gas. But submitting a tender for establishing an accommodation based project in Penang. Hopefully that goes well.. 

How's your side?
7493 2018-01-08 05:47:23 Oil of oregano.   Google it
7494 2018-01-08 05:47:21 the combo of the oil + cetaphil + no makeup + the sun had my skin looking so good. now it’s all gross :(
7495 2018-01-08 05:47:18 Climate Hustler, snake oil salesman, Al Gore.
7496 2018-01-08 05:47:13 You’re in the pocket of FSB and Kremlins oil interests and you dare accuse anybody of being paid?
7497 2018-01-08 05:47:10 I oppose this new draft. Follow Germany’s example on energy. Wind and solar energy is the future. Oil and gas is the past.
7498 2018-01-08 05:47:02 @NextRevFNC  Good job detailing the big oil network in DC but you presented absolutely no evidence of any corruption resulting from it. Exercising the right to petition government is not corruption.
7499 2018-01-08 05:46:57 Yes, it should definitely be positive for Reliance, ONGC (via OPAL), Indian Oil. Petrochemicals margins should be good for Q3.

7508 2018-01-08 05:44:40 Une question à résoudre : pourquoi le syndicat des transporteurs ainsi que les patrons routiers ne réagissent pas contre l'augmentation du gaz oil ? Il y aurait-il un deal entre eux et le gouvernement ?
7509 2018-01-08 05:44:40 Did you even read the article? They had nothing to do with the decline of the company because all oil companies are suffering similar loss s due to prices of oil. Also the lawsuit is about them stepping down from their positions so I'm not sure what you're trying to prove here.
7510 2018-01-08 05:44:31 Well, I did originally say trolling wasn’t constructive for dialogue of complex issues in reference to oil and gas. Applies to Hollywood too.
7511 2018-01-08 05:44:24 Hotels unaware that used cooking oil can yield biodiesel: Bengaluru generates a huge quantity of oil and grease…

7517 2018-01-08 05:43:12 Jasmine oil is a wonderful thing. I find that, personally, I seem to favour simple natural scents these days - without too much complexity. That said, I seem to smell of insect repellent and suncream on a more-or-less perpetual basis now...!
7518 2018-01-08 05:43:11 Check your Transmission oil today.
7519 2018-01-08 05:43:09 I see France also offered to supply Cape with water. I trust Prov. Govt has accepted the offer. I assume they will ship it in using tankers? So my idea a few weeks ago to prepare unused oil storage tanks to store shipments of water was not so silly.
7520 2018-01-08 05:43:00 Does anything give you more of a thrill than tracking your Amazon package? Like YES my baby is in the Arizona shipment facility can’t wait to try my new essential oil diffuser. Should be here Friday the 12th!!!!!!!

4. Section hair into 4, comb out & rinse
5. Apply black castor oil from root to ends
6. Put shea leave in conditioner 
7. Apply Eco gel root to ends 
8. Let air dry.
7536 2018-01-08 05:40:48 Because they need to have enough money to pay McDavid next year . If they acquire players that gets them to the cap they have to pay them next year as well. Players who will become UFA aren’t usually traded till the deadline

7546 2018-01-08 05:38:09 A Chinese ship and an Iranian oil tanker collide and all of the Chinese crew are safe and drinking tea but NONE of the Iranian crew are accounted for... meanwhile, the oil is leaking , the ship on fire..... but none of the crew..

7548 2018-01-08 05:37:17 @GotfriedMLA  Is the oil industry recovering from a very severe down turn? An excellent job done by Alberta's oil industry!! They have tackled some really tough times. Thank you for helping to steer us through.
7549 2018-01-08 05:36:44 What does next year have to do with this year?  His job is to manage the cap each and every year not just “next year”

7551 2018-01-08 05:35:40 These cars are not useful any were north of Prince George.  Therefore we still need bchydro and the oil and gas industry. Like it or not, we will still need pipelines for many many years to come. We will also need site c. Wind and solar just don't cut it.
7552 2018-01-08 05:35:32 I once told my co-workers while working in a reputable oil and gas firm that we all have limited time to spend. We must discover and develop that passion which enhances our productivity and brings forth fulfilment within.
7553 2018-01-08 05:35:15 Did @cathmckenna ask this guy why California keeps processing oil that has a larger carbon footprint than oil sands oil?? Is she even knowledgeable enough to know this? I bloody well doubt it. Just virtue signaling. No wonder ppl call her climate Barbie!
7554 2018-01-08 05:35:03 Awesome  The tea tree oil totally killed mine  I’m hoping it will kill all the crap my fellow passengers coughs out. If I can go for a week without being sick I’m winning

7556 2018-01-08 05:34:26 How about this particular GM having his handy work come back to bite him once again? That sounds a tad more accurate.

7562 2018-01-08 05:33:10 Rescue crews scrambled to bring a blaze on an Iranian oil tanker off China's east coast under control on Monday as fire raged for a second day following a collision with a grain ship, while the U.S. Navy joined the search for 32 missing crew.

7566 2018-01-08 05:32:34 Oil surges, stock market surges, wealthy corporations and wealthiest Americans about to get largest transfer of wealth ever from poor & middle class, jobs down, consumer protections repealed - sounding more and more like we’re headed for another recession.
7567 2018-01-08 05:32:27 Husband: I know you wanted me to rub eucalyptus oil on your breasts, but I got something better. I put cumin and turmeric in this canola oil! Take off your shirt, baby! We're taking your tits to flavortown! Population: You, me, and the girls.
7568 2018-01-08 05:32:14 Mix it with an oil like coconut oil or jojoba oil

7576 2018-01-08 05:31:00 In the end, I think the best we can do is prevent others from taking the snake oil from people like Richard Spencer.
7577 2018-01-08 05:30:57 Putting coconut oil in your hair always seems like a good idea until it’s time to wash it out
7578 2018-01-08 05:30:48 OIL DIFF: 6.44 -> 6.45
7579 2018-01-08 05:30:45 Anyway, we have some interesting times ahead in Oil Country. Its like a good reality show.

7586 2018-01-08 05:29:57 Look oprah made some great points but I’m sorry how many lies & snake oil salesmen has she inflicted on us over the years? Speaking “your truth” does not mean the actual truth. Which we sometimes don’t like do we?
7587 2018-01-08 05:29:55 I retired a couple of years ago, so have lots of free time.  I don't know a thing about running a fracking rig (or any oil rig, for that matter), but I watched a couple of YouTube videos, and think I've got a pretty good idea of what needs to be done.  Anyway, let me know, thanks

7591 2018-01-08 05:29:23 I see that @SenatorCollins opposes drilling for oil off the shore of Maine...but also voted for the GOP tax bill that allows drilling in the arctic. #notinherbackyard #hypocrite
7592 2018-01-08 05:29:04 Yeah need to coat with linseed oil I think and then varnish it

7598 2018-01-08 05:27:51 I’m sure it’s fine whether skin is dry or oily ! Adding oil to oily skin can actually help by decreasing the need for natural production
7599 2018-01-08 05:27:45 Don't say what you don't know. Over 5000 returnees r expected in PH. Rivers ppl can not leave oil and walk to libya.  Certainly they r not Rivers ppl. My question is PH? What happened to Lagos that they were using??  Answer or shut up!

7612 2018-01-08 05:25:53 The average cost for a barrel of oil in the United States from 1900-1932 was $1.164 per barrel. That is equivalent to 0.0563 ounces of gold. 

Today, 0.0563 ounces of gold will buy you $74.316 worth of oil.

7624 2018-01-08 05:24:04 This will most likely change in November, and be wiped clean of perks and subsidies.  Enough with the proliferation of dirty energy. We don't need it.  At least, not much longer.  Change is coming, and oil may retain a small segment, which will shrink with green development.

7628 2018-01-08 05:23:27 Thank God. America's middle class could not have survive another 8 years of Obama's policies. We'd still be importing oil, giving billions $ to green slush fund, be blackmailed by NK, ISIS Caliphate would be expanding, Syria still using chemical weapons. So glad for Trump!
7629 2018-01-08 05:23:24 I wish you would look at all the oil and defense companies that live off our taxes and take advantage of their position to charge outrageous amounts. Guaranteed savings 10^3 times more money than going after immigrants

7634 2018-01-08 05:23:10  Americans, the surprise announcement of arresting and revoking peoples right to use  cannabis , and environmental announcement about coastal oil drilling is just a distractive ploy to take your attention away from the Russian issue.
7635 2018-01-08 05:22:40 Qaddaffi was only thing standing in the way of feueds of ~100 Libyan tribes, less people died under his ENTIRER rule then in 1 year after you brought "democracy" (set him to be killed by anally rapped with a sharpe stake), and his true crime was wanting to sell oil for gold.

7640 2018-01-08 05:21:50 Then maybe it’s better to focus on dialogue? From an oil & gas industry perspective - hardly appropriate time to throw stones and if anything a learning opportunity to improve. Pretty sure many women of @PinkPetro would agree.

7666 2018-01-08 05:15:55 Ummmm I don’t think so, it feels better if you use a carrier oil like jojoba or argan oil (those are my fav two). Just use like 2(oil):1(tea tree). Also make sure whichever oil u use is safe for use on theeeee faacceee good luck! I don’t know if that was helpful

7684 2018-01-08 05:13:20 It was lost on me 

Assumed you were using market cap as a signal of value that African leaders should open their eyes to.

Naively, I focused more on the dangers of trusting market cap, instead of your point that oil isn't the only valuable thing around.

Whoops

7687 2018-01-08 05:12:53 True. They ignored rising oil price in 2009 to pander to SoCons. Perhaps if they had paid attention to the economy.

7695 2018-01-08 05:12:03 So sad that trump's got you brainwashed to believe that. He did that so you will never believe anything that's written about him that doesn't heap praise upon his head. I don't know what it's going to take to get you trump supporters to wake up and smell the snake oil.
7696 2018-01-08 05:11:58 The waiter complimented my perfume. I told him it's Armani Si. I've just realised that it's probably the jasmine oil from India that he can smell. It's so strong (and lovely)!

7822 2018-01-08 04:51:55 It depends on the type. If it's a Peter Pan or jif then typically don't put it in the fridge. But if it's schmuckers natural or some fancy kind where the oil separates I'll put it in the fridge after stirring.

7848 2018-01-08 04:46:40 yeah for eight years he used his brains to try to make  things better by not doing stupid things. Burning more coal and dirty oil pipelines will only hasten our global climate demise
7849 2018-01-08 04:46:32 SHE WAS SO CONCERNED W THE OIL AJAJAJAKALALSMZM
7850 2018-01-08 04:46:31 Somebody could’ve told me that this Wild Hair-growth oil makes your head itch so bad  
7851 2018-01-08 04:46:21 But ive really wanted to paint lately and I’m more excited than afraid to see what I will do with oil and canvas so I’m looking forward to getting some new supplies!
7852 2018-01-08 04:46:21 Probably could get away with a light steel wool or scotch brite, then linseed oil to fill the marks!
7853 2018-01-08 04:46:12 Just found out there’s salmon oil that comes in a pump to put on your pets food instead of pills!!!!!! Wow that would make things so much easier for my aging lil baby
7854 2018-01-08 04:46:08 I guess I just don't feel crushed by the government trying to make sure oil rigs don't explode, kill people, and cause environmentally & economically catastrophic oil spills.
7855 2018-01-08 04:46:01 6. Experts, on the other hand, have long uttered their disappointment following the inaction of the government to have never built our own refinery plants. Therefore, I wouldn't put it past the gov to eventually raise the oil price.
7856 2018-01-08 04:45:50 Yup. And it actually cleared up my skin. I switched to something different when I got here but then switched back to coconut oil.
7857 2018-01-08 04:45:40 I need a full body massage with that body oil 
7858 2018-01-08 04:45:21 #beautytips #cracklips #EpsomSalt
Dry, flaky and cracked lips cause pain?  Epsom Salt can rescue efficiently.  Mix coconut oil and Epsom Salt with ratio 1/1 to becoming lip balm form.  Voila, you use the solution to healing nicely and naturally the discomfort condition.

7880 2018-01-08 04:42:45 We ARE the Cleveland Browns Bob.  This organization just cannot figure out how to put a consistent product on the ice.  I wouldn't care nearly as much if the Oil had this record via tight, tough games.  It's the way that they are losing that HAS to be unacceptable. #TuneOutTodd
7881 2018-01-08 04:42:44 If they though wind generators would be un- sightly off our shores; what would oil rigs do to the magnificent sceneries? This nothing to all the added industialize traffic!

7888 2018-01-08 04:41:40 This is my first time using tea tree oil since my last relationship. I stopped using it because the scent reminded me of perfect times and no so perfect times in the relationship. Grateful to know it has a new feeling. 

Refreshed.

7892 2018-01-08 04:41:07 And I say it is just the usual B.S. They just wanted more oil and money and wanted to contain Iran and mullas will obligate
7893 2018-01-08 04:40:51 What type of oil evens out skin tone and get rid of scars? Bio Oil, coconut oil or Argan Oil?
7894 2018-01-08 04:40:51 Oil and I must have their hands unto its mouth, and endless oil and were there.
7895 2018-01-08 04:40:43 Oh. Not to me though. I'd expect a few things to work, depending on where and what..... Tea tree, oregano oil, for example I'd always research first tho, obviously.

Actually never mind, I hated Oil Ocean. Wayyyy to harmful to the environment. Nature retook that zone. It’s like, a forest now. Industrial tho’.”
7921 2018-01-08 04:37:13 They also managed to win games while overcoming injuries, would've made it if Stamkos played at least 5-10 more games. The Oil have proven in many years that they can't do the same.
7922 2018-01-08 04:37:02 These three made their money from the oil business in Russia.
President Trump is heavily promoting the sale of LNG to Poland and other EU countries. Cutting into the Russian energy business.
One of the three was a major Obama donor in 2011.
Yea I can see where this will lead.

7972 2018-01-08 04:28:33 3...- oil prices rose to an average of $50 last year, higher than the $45 assumed for 2017 budget calculations. Last week, oil prices rose to $60, higher than the $48 assumed for the 2018 budget estimate. They knew last year's oil price was $50, but why do they now assume ...

7973 2018-01-08 04:28:22 So the same thing that happened last transfer season where everyone in Alexis' camp saying it's done while everyone in Arsenal's camp saying that they are still negotiating to "Get those big oil money people". This is going to be a long transfer thread.

7983 2018-01-08 04:27:26 So I'm saying look at the list of people quoted 
It's important people who were actually involved 
And they're all confirming what was said
7984 2018-01-08 04:27:22 My big thing is: if you trade 29/93/98/77/6 you're essentially adressing one need and creating another hole, no?

Again, we don't know what offers whoever in charge will get, so it's almost a mute point

And they are saying that he got it correct

7994 2018-01-08 04:26:01 i fell into a rabbit hole of skincare pinterest (?) and saw a post telling the people to tone after applying oil ???????? hell is empty the devils are all here
7995 2018-01-08 04:26:01 I can't stand the never-ending praise when she's foisted a ton of snake oil on an easily duped public in the past.
7996 2018-01-08 04:25:45 Who’s tryna fuck around with some oil paints tonight cause I know I am
7997 2018-01-08 04:25:44 And I have a list of 5 players, that I feel would be a big mistake to trade under 99% of circumstances
7998 2018-01-08 04:25:43 I don’t think both 93 and 29 are in there…it’s likely one or the other long term. Puljujarvi is certainly valuable, but he’s not there yet. I can argue for trading any of the Dmen. Klefbom is the one I’m least inclined to move
7999 2018-01-08 04:25:28 is tea tree oil supposed to burn when you put it on asking for a friend also why is the stress of the semester already causing me to break out if the s e m e s t e r  h a s n t  e v e n  s t a r t e d  y e t

8001 2018-01-08 04:24:58 Trump wants Clinton to take his place in the headlines.He went from just talk to action. His issues are like oil it'll still rise above anything they're trying to create. #TrumpIsAMoron #Resist
8002 2018-01-08 04:24:55 Sugar and coconut oil scrubbed my legs, shaved and then moisturized with coconut oil. My legs have never been so smooth!  
8003 2018-01-08 04:24:53 I JUST SPILLED VITAMIN E OIL IN MY LAPTOP KEYBOARD SOMEONE HELP
8004 2018-01-08 04:24:29 I would hope 29 + 93 are safe, but I also see that side of the argument
8005 2018-01-08 04:24:21 Problem remains they gave away the assets they had for next to nothing & It's come back to haunt them...as we all knew it would.
8006 2018-01-08 04:24:07 i was trying to get my diffuser to work and it malfunctioned and shot a stream of lavender oil directly into my eye i wanna fight
8007 2018-01-08 04:23:57 Yeah… Maybe. —Yeah, definitely dying because of an imminent fire caused by a barrel spilling oil and a exploding cake sounds like fun. Too much fun, indeed.—
8008 2018-01-08 04:23:57 Australian tea tree oil for the win 
8009 2018-01-08 04:23:56 Reminds me of the poor coal miners Trump conned. Coal is not coming back and oil is declining. Some long for the security of the past and politicians take advantage of it. We need to find ways to move ahead w/the world.
8010 2018-01-08 04:23:55 No makeup remover? No worries! Grab extra virgin olive oil out of your kitchen! Olive oil is natural, moisturizing &amp; will remove makeup.
8011 2018-01-08 04:23:53 How much money has Rex gotten for this opinion from the Oil industry.
8012 2018-01-08 04:23:51 Kak iman klau amal extra virgin coconut oil tu blh ke?

8014 2018-01-08 04:23:38 How much if the fund has been used to clean up oil spills?
8015 2018-01-08 04:23:37 Honestly, it’s a core of one. I can make a case for moving literally anyone else.
8016 2018-01-08 04:23:35 My "core" is:

F - 97/29/93/98 (maayyybbbe Yamamoto)

D - 77/25/6 (Sekera to some extent)

Its not Tampa Bay big. There's high-end talent, just no depth (especially on F)
8017 2018-01-08 04:23:17 2....this republic has take a leaf out of the book of capitalism. What always troubles common people is the real reason why the gov seems to always have low estimate of oil prices in its state budget. Two examples, which today's editorial shows, are cases in point ....

8020 2018-01-08 04:23:07 Some aromatherapy shops have headache blends as roll-ons. Lavender oil works well as a relaxant & smells good with mint too
8021 2018-01-08 04:23:00 Since Toronto trades like 75% of world mining industry there are deep Russian contacts. Oil industry analysis dominates - so again ex USSR watched very closely. Toronto has inflated real estate & laundering & all global mobs, knows NYC well, but isnt afraid to comment on it.
8022 2018-01-08 04:22:53 we have no oil petro !! we have a automatic oil delivery and a top service contact !! My family just got back from skiing to come home to a house that is 44 degrees !! petro is putting my house and my family at risk !! i've been on hold for 2 1/2 hrs .. great job
8023 2018-01-08 04:22:50 Trump is no friend of farmers. Killed TPP, wants to pull us out of NAFTA, changes ethanol regs. to favor big oil, tax bill is bad for coops, killed net neutrality, science denier,,,,
8024 2018-01-08 04:22:43 In some countries, people have to walk two hours for water, but this beats that by a mile.

As a fellow cracked skin sufferer, I feel your pain. 3 wild salmon oil pills every night. Rub yourself down with coconut oil every night. You’re welcome.

8027 2018-01-08 04:22:27 Let's stop global climate change by not drilling for oil and they won't have to suffer. Keep the oil in the soil.
8028 2018-01-08 04:22:16 Tylenol is fine but not ibuprofen. If you're already drinking a lot of water try a soda, sometimes that helps. There's an oil you can smell but I'm not sure if it's pregnancy safe or not. I've misplaced my list of do's & don'ts.
8029 2018-01-08 04:22:13 Yeah I see that side of it.

I think with a few smart moves (good FA deals/tough trades like you said) the Oilers could be a playoff team next year, but not an elite team like TB.
8030 2018-01-08 04:22:07 Juice 1 meal a day! Throw in fresh fruits & veggies, peanut/almond butter, flaxseed, a drop of fish oil, & see how great you look & feel!
8031 2018-01-08 04:22:05 Possible. But China, the world’s largest oil importer, is slowing. Suggests weaker oil.

8035 2018-01-08 04:21:38 To be honest, their core isn't that big.
8036 2018-01-08 04:21:33 I agree with your premise, but they may need to re-structure to create balance and cap flexibility. Core isn’t safe beyond 97.
8037 2018-01-08 04:21:31 Beyond being a billion times smarter than the orange idiot, Oprah is also a billion times the business person Trump is as well. 

Trump is just a snake oil salesman to the feeble minded.

what kind of build do you give your warlock?? if you can build him clever strike + fire oil you can probably get better DPS against her than firestorm (or w/e it was called) just keep her head bound or ailmented so she cant
8045 2018-01-08 04:20:50 Yes but the Bolts were already stacked and have many a player on reasonable deals. The Oilers have neither.
8046 2018-01-08 04:20:27 I forgot my hair oil at home I’m fr gonna need Jesus 
8047 2018-01-08 04:20:23 US oil imports keep dropping while those of China and India keep rising. China is world’s largest importer of oil right now.
8048 2018-01-08 04:20:14 I added oil to my car today and coolant,steering wheel fluid and booked my oil change at niello 
8049 2018-01-08 04:20:13 Yeah, and he ran the economy into the ground. He also ran a baseball team into the ground. Also, an oil company. His governorship was the product of nepotism.

8058 2018-01-08 04:18:26 Just like I pointed out that Tampa Bay did by signing Kunitz/Girardi (debatable on the value there) and dealing Drouin.
8059 2018-01-08 04:18:19 Oil change was a success 
8060 2018-01-08 04:18:06 I just got an oil diffuser last week but I keep getting headaches. Not sure if it’s coincidence or related lol.

8064 2018-01-08 04:17:29 Of course not but fixing this won't be easy. They are going to have to take advantage of value one-year UFA signings and make some smart but likely difficult trades.
8065 2018-01-08 04:17:18 It's amazing! looks like an actual oil painting too!
8066 2018-01-08 04:17:09 You're not living until you tried this: Wawa turkey hoagie with swiss cheese on a wheat roll, whole thing toasted, ex oil, ex mayo, tomatoes, onions and ex sun-dried tomatoe spread... banging
8067 2018-01-08 04:16:54 I've read that coconut oil will help with your dog's coat and my mom feeds it to her puppers. She swears by it, but you have to introduce it in small amounts or your pupper will get sick.
8068 2018-01-08 04:16:54 How did I ever sleep without a heated blanket and lavender essential oil

8071 2018-01-08 04:16:20 I love coconut oil and all of its benefits. I also LOVE all of my essential oils and their benefits. But they all smell so bad. 
8072 2018-01-08 04:16:15 Steam infused with Eucalyptus Oil will clear that right up!! I hope you get to feeling better, Miss Shannon!!

8077 2018-01-08 04:14:14 Protip: use coconut oil. All the vitamin e without the pachouli and sandalwood smell.  Makes a beard shine and be less itchy.
8078 2018-01-08 04:14:12 Greed greed greed not a care not thought to the long term effects on the earth or ecosystem or people...bribery from the gas and oil companies am sure the root of all evil...that almighty $ you can’t take with you when your 6ft in the ground dead! This admin is pathetic!!

8084 2018-01-08 04:13:28 i told my mom and her friend to not touch my oil painting and thats exactly what they did and messed it up
8085 2018-01-08 04:13:23 Define blow it up. Should they trade their best players? No. That’s how the mess got made, should they make substantive changes? YES.

8094 2018-01-08 04:11:35 Waiting until the deadline was stupid . Both ottawa and montreal are in markets where they need results.
8095 2018-01-08 04:11:33 100%. TB had much deeper roster and the GM still managed to pull off an actual trade for a potential stud 19-yr old blueliner for good measure. Two situations are nothing alike.
8096 2018-01-08 04:11:27 1/4 cup nutritional yeast, 2 tsp onion powder, 2 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp dried parsley, 3 tsp dried chives (I don't do this lol), 1/2 tsp salt. Mix them all together. Add melted butter or oil to the popcorn first so it sticks, then add seasoning. It's honestly SO blessed.
8097 2018-01-08 04:11:23 Yeah, I wasn’t just making a joke. Phil abuses addicts then gaslights them by implying they can never be believed, and Oz sells snake oil and coddles people who do gay conversion therapy. Oprah has a bad picker.
8098 2018-01-08 04:11:22 The way Real Madrid is going down, they might end up discovering oil before Arsenal... In other news, It's 2018 and penaldo still loves keeping clean sheets.

8120 2018-01-08 04:09:13 Be careful when you apply it to your temples its oil so it can migrate into your eyes and you do not want that.  Use very little on that sensitive eye area.  You can use these defusers too.  They work great to aid in sleep or when you’re sick.

8136 2018-01-08 04:07:25 this is just a reminder to avoid PALM OIL!!! it’s a major cause for deforestation in the rain forest and killing our primates !!!!!
8137 2018-01-08 04:07:23 I'm staying at my parents' house and my step mum left me a little note that said "Put the potatoes in the oven at 5pm" and in the fridge there was an oven tray of potatoes with the oil and herbs already on them

8146 2018-01-08 04:04:55 Oprah is the anti-Trump in every conceivable way. She's everything he wants to be but can never be since he's a lazy, ignorant, cruel, horrible business man and  greasy snake oil salesman.
8147 2018-01-08 04:04:34 Just massaged castor and peppermint oil into my scalp. I smell like a candy cane.

8151 2018-01-08 04:04:17 Yup. And PET tried to nationalize our resources and these guys now claiming it's "Canadian oil" being obstructed screamed their heads off and told NEP-boogieman myths to their kids & grandkids!
8152 2018-01-08 04:04:13 So what I'm getting from that headline is conservatives tend to be more mentally stable, since they are less likely to suicide after a lost election.
8153 2018-01-08 04:04:00 Mark Haggerty of Headwaters Economics in Montana said that while oil and natural gas were likely to be stronger in 2018 than in the last two years, coal is expected to see a long, downward trend.

8160 2018-01-08 04:02:45 And yet you are willing to start your car, science. Rely on oil located and extracted by science. Appear on this mysterious device developed by our scientific understanding of electronics. Why is all that you real, but the understanding of climate false?
8161 2018-01-08 04:02:33 Definitely need to get this oil change and car wash tomorrow 
8162 2018-01-08 04:02:31 When I was a little girl I used to hate my eyebrows. I always hid them under my bangs and now ppl are using castor oil on their brows to grow them out. Something I - all brown/Latina girls - used to be so ashamed of is now idolized on white skin.

8173 2018-01-08 04:01:19 I also use The same atarte Oil and the SmashBox oil. And at night I use the Estée Lauder Advanced night repair. And massaging the lines away and up helps so does tapping on them. I massagemy face up out and down and tap tap tap. And I don’t think I look 50 I still get ID
8174 2018-01-08 04:01:14 @PetroHome has completely failed my family today. I called at 7am and reported my oil burner was down on a 4 degree day. I have a three month old baby and a two year old. It’s not 11pm and not a single update from Petro. My house is 45 degrees and I’ve been on hold for 1.5 hours.

8182 2018-01-08 03:59:40 Exactly. He didn’t improve the roster (made it worse) in the last year of McDavid entry deal. Left huge cap space unused. Probably the worst GM they had. Lost all the biggest deals he has made. Sorry Bob but they can’t allow him to make more moves

8187 2018-01-08 03:58:59 Hi Kathy, Yes!  Very sadly it is the one that is recommended above most others and even stores like whole foods uses it in their prepared foods as their main oil… I’ve even talk to them about it.
8188 2018-01-08 03:58:55 โตขนาดนั้นละ ทำอะไรไม่คิดก่อนทำ
8189 2018-01-08 03:58:46 Had not said anything about our own State Police issues or the dead beats who leave abandon oil gas wells
8190 2018-01-08 03:57:54 Ah. I'm assuming that because no oil or any other product is used, it doesn't have a smell.
8191 2018-01-08 03:57:36 I wonder if you can get onion essential oil
8192 2018-01-08 03:57:24 Asset level is positively linked to environmental, war &terrorism criminality)crimes on the high seas by lobbying& media liars for big oil in USA will murder cetaceans who have our intelligence by dumping frack waste in oceans&even republicans mostly don’t want ocean rigs
8193 2018-01-08 03:57:23 Laughing @Oprah. Really Oprah. Nice talk but other than snake oil positive thinking puffery what exactly did you do about sexual harrassmen? Didn't know or didn't care until it became a big story?
8194 2018-01-08 03:57:19 We need to diversify. I did it when I was laid off.
So can the oil patch. 20-somethings hanging on to false hope that oil will once again rule this province is short-sighted.
8195 2018-01-08 03:56:30 Spent over $300 to keep my aging Escape from failing apart. Oil change, new belt, the whole shebang. Sheesh.

8225 2018-01-08 03:51:27 The tea is we're not "weak af". 

Also, the appreciation/depreciation of RM has more to do with global economic conditions rather than governance. This time, its due to appreciation of oil prices. 

And ER is always volatile. But the bandwidth of volatility is stable and healthy.
8226 2018-01-08 03:50:58 I know, what we deal with trying to find pain relief that isn't snake oil!

DON'T TAKE THE JOBS, don't invest in the companies, don't buy their products. Time & money speak much louder than grandstanding

8244 2018-01-08 03:48:06 I was using the shea moisture black castor oil .... garbage. It used to be lovely. I’m assuming they changed the product. Smh. Trash as fuck

8259 2018-01-08 03:45:49 Now speaking after applying experience to written word. Just a little oil is all it takes. Haven’t seen that tossing in a ziplock bag trick  before but it’s brilliant. Will get oil on evenly & no cleanup.  Am now craving carbs in a dangerous way. 
8260 2018-01-08 03:45:47 I'm not sure they have an Oilfield in Ukraine as they had been receiving their oil from Russia for free the past few years by not paying them but I'm sure you knew that.
8261 2018-01-08 03:45:47 I'd say acrylic fits your style better but if you're going to try oil this piece would be the one to do it~ all the glossy armor

8269 2018-01-08 03:44:53 Duh? You realize oil, gas, and coal are limited. The markets are shrinking, especially for coal. Various reasons, including how finite they are. But we're going to keep chasing that while everyone else switches gears, and then we'll be buying more crap from China eventually.
8270 2018-01-08 03:44:51 Was gonna say the same lol coconut oil 
8271 2018-01-08 03:44:49 It amuses me a bit that Alberta would dearly love someone, anyone to manage supplies such that the price of oil is increased, while simultaneously objecting to dairy supply management.
8272 2018-01-08 03:44:06 1) I very much dislike that 2) she wasn't even using it to describe the filling she just kept telling people their churros were "impregnated" with oil

8290 2018-01-08 03:41:19 Okay, I confess I was supporting the principle of homemade sweet potato fries, not a particular recipe. Let me read this one. If you toss or spray w oil or olive oil my $ is on them coming out crisp.
8291 2018-01-08 03:41:12 No problem whatsoever with the coach sticking around Bob but that is where it ends.
8292 2018-01-08 03:41:02 Yes, I know.
8293 2018-01-08 03:40:57 The oil will not get you high and the oil is needed for the sick
8294 2018-01-08 03:40:53 Maybe nothing of an imminent nature but of  possible things to come

8298 2018-01-08 03:40:24 I have nothing but contempt for Miller.  He's what I see when I imagine a sleazy snake oil salesman.

What I actually did today:
-drank a lotta wine
-binge watched Vampire Diaries (again)
-grumbled about unrealistic representations of romance/men
-at least I did a lil laundry
8303 2018-01-08 03:40:07 I’m way too old to cry about shit, but I spilled hot oil on my leg and cried like a lil bitch for like 20 mins 
8304 2018-01-08 03:39:47 silked K2 hair down w/ this coconut oiloh well.. we can’t do bald head babies.
8305 2018-01-08 03:39:41 I'm pushing myself beyond my limits, and that is where the oil will be produced.

8310 2018-01-08 03:38:58 Except the Saudis have a giant "Invest in things so we aren't fucked when we run out of oil" fund, which includes a project to turn their entire desert into a giant solar farm and export electricity.

8313 2018-01-08 03:38:24 I really hope Oprah doesn’t run for president. I can’t take Dr. Phil or Dr. Oz  or any of the snake oil people she has launched into fame that would be in her administration. Seriously Oprah just enjoy being rich.
8314 2018-01-08 03:38:05 This distrust of medicine is one of the key concepts heavily marketed by charlatans, along with the notion that whatever XYZ snake oil they sell is a panacea.

8317 2018-01-08 03:37:54 Witch Hazel is an extract (from the bark of witch hazel trees) diluted in alcohol or water, you can find it in a big bottle. Toner us any liquid used to tone the skin by removing dust/oil/pollutants not removed by cleansing alone, and often reduce pore size.

8328 2018-01-08 03:36:03 A huge reason there is so much debauchery and sin in the world is that too many people are eating food that has been cooked by boiling it in oil!
8329 2018-01-08 03:35:47 My father just screamed at me because he thought my oil diffuser was a mother fucking hookah.
8330 2018-01-08 03:35:46 Tomorrow is going to be a long day gotta get my oil changed then get my hair braided so I can finish it still gotta finish packing and cleaning
8331 2018-01-08 03:35:33 That would be a bit like writing "Iraq is the most popular country to steal the most oil from" and "The most popular choice of victim in police shootings are black people"
8332 2018-01-08 03:35:26 Future ashy? I bought lotion and I keep coconut oil on deck!  And if I was gonna butter you up it would start with butter in a skillet.

8336 2018-01-08 03:34:55 It’s like a pasta salad with raw peas from the can. You make pasta and hardboil an egg or two, cut the egg up into small pieces, cut up a pickle, make some sort of quick olive oil sauce I don’t remember, and mix small together. It sounds gross but I loved it as a kid lol.
8337 2018-01-08 03:34:54 Basically i just need to stop using coconut oil to take off my makeup because i think its a bit too much lol

8343 2018-01-08 03:34:12 I made #vegan mashed potatoes tonight. They were delish. I used butter flavored olive oil instead of milk and butter. OMG! I’m adding it to the rotation.

8354 2018-01-08 03:33:34 Today was all about self love, Chores, and a heavy layer of coconut oil. Only left the house for barre3 class so far.
8355 2018-01-08 03:33:33 Here's the other side... the vast majority of hockey experts and insiders projected the oil to be a top tier team/ contend with the roster you see now. Hard to predict so many regressions. And if this many players underachieve maybe it is on coach. Hurts 2 say b/c I like tmac

8362 2018-01-08 03:32:49 Togo does not have any sizable commercial oil play. Exploration prospects are not the same as producing assets. Try to understand before writing. If Togo has sold $2billion worth of crude oil, it is most likely from Nigeria. Not shocking as this trade has been on for a while.

8366 2018-01-08 03:31:53 There's a lot I can learn from trump.
Even with a 100 IQ you can do very well as long as you have an over
abundance of confidence (Dunning Kruger style) and no morals. 
He is a wonderful snake oil salesman.

Hmmm... now what can I use as my snake oil?
8367 2018-01-08 03:31:50 Rose hip oil! Bonus is that it's super inexpensive. I use Pearlessence brand, but there are a ton of good brands out there.
8368 2018-01-08 03:31:42 A very fair point.

8395 2018-01-08 03:27:45 Simply get some chicken breast and cook it in a splash of oil and seasoning for 6 minutes. Add some straight to the wok noodles for 3 minutes and add the chilli sauce with it too.
8396 2018-01-08 03:26:57 Because it’s a new year and I need to rebuild my portfolio. I’m gonna need to burn the midnight oil and add more artworks

8397 2018-01-08 03:26:56 From what ive read and from when an ex tried it for me. Coconut oil should help with any uncomfortableness. Will make the hair soft and help with the initial itchiness that comes after waxing or shaving for so long.
8398 2018-01-08 03:26:51 I like how you worded that. I do wonder if Chiarelli is a bit handcuffed...

8401 2018-01-08 03:26:19 Truffle oil is like a metaphor for everything wrong with this administration. Its ridiculously expensive and unavoidable stink is everywhere lately, but doesn’t improve anything, as most oils are fake. Usually found in the company of pigs and underground.
8402 2018-01-08 03:26:15 Looks good! I usually oven roast my asparagus/broccoli but pan frying should work, just have to get it hot enough with some good oil or such to conduct that heat into the veggies. Lots of good tutorials/ideas on cooking sites and YouTube these days!

8404 2018-01-08 03:26:08 last night the top fell off my essential oil I was putting into my diffuser so instead of a couple drops I diffused a whole mother f’n bottle last night & figured “it would be fine” but no I woke up at 1am CHOKING ON LAVENDER OIL on the VERGE of DEATH by SUFFOCATION
8405 2018-01-08 03:26:06 So one ship had oil from Iran to Rok, the other grain from Us to China.  So, who was driving the grain ship?  Seal team?
8406 2018-01-08 03:25:45 Obviously I'm being a tad facetious because Rob wants Chiarelli gone. 

Notice how everything has suddenly gone very quiet out of the oilers? I'm willing to bet there's a meeting going on right now to decide who is losing their job.

8417 2018-01-08 03:24:42 The tunnel is dark and when a star and now a coach cant see the end there is a deeper problem . A coach is respinsible for instilling confidence and fixing the deficencies. McClellan seems "tambelinni" frozen

8426 2018-01-08 03:23:29 After 17 hours without heat, my dad and I were able to turn on the oil burner without the assitance of Petro technicians. Not by choice though — they just never showed up. What’s the point of having a contract with you if you don’t go through with it? @PetroHome
8427 2018-01-08 03:23:29 You will LOVE it it’s beautiful! Every single frame was oil painted and it’s a sort of crime drama about Van Gogh/mental health & SO GOOD
8428 2018-01-08 03:23:21 (2/2) ...eucalyptus to hang in my shower, but can’t find one. I thought the steam would help us breathe better. The oil is my next best thing.

8430 2018-01-08 03:22:58 Ooooo yes I forgot about the rice water!!!! I been wanting to try this. I’ve also started doing scalp massages and using wild hair growth oil. I never used it once I bought it
8431 2018-01-08 03:22:54 @realDonaldTrump I plan on investing in offshore oil drilling. I have found a location by Mar-a-Largo. I also understand @MMFlint plans on doing the same. Glad you support this. #WeMightHaveARepeat #DeepHorizon but your #EPA is ok with this. See ya soon
8432 2018-01-08 03:22:38 If it’s a choice between the two, I would keep Todd on, at least for now.
8433 2018-01-08 03:22:24 Omg it’s so simple... literally breaded the chicken with eggs, and breadcrumb w/ seasoned salt & onion powder & baked it. Then used the zoodle thing to spiralize the zucchini & heated that in olive oil and garlic! And added marinara

8436 2018-01-08 03:21:40 Not sure I agree w that. We have 80+ games of a bad PK, & PP is now sputtering. I fresh coach on those 2 units can only help, and what could they possibly disrupt?

That ain't pizza. That's trash.
8438 2018-01-08 03:21:29 Oil city?

That place sucked.
8439 2018-01-08 03:21:28 You’re in Alberta, dude. Your province has had decades to grow past oil and build a nest egg – and the PCs didn’t do either. They just sold off your resources for way below market value while sneering at the rest of the country.

Nothing about blood of a chicken. There was hyssop oil used which has antibacterial (& antifungal?) properties.

Guess it's a good thing I still got a week of break left?
8470 2018-01-08 03:17:17 Same! I heard coconut oil works

8472 2018-01-08 03:16:59 Chinas New Silk Road is an enormus undertaking. connecting China with Europe via super highways and highspeed rail as well as laying oil and gas infrastructure.

8479 2018-01-08 03:15:55 "Who doesn't love @Oprah?"  She singlehandedly launched the anti-vax movement by giving a platform to Jenny McCarthy, she promoted Drs. Phil & Oz to sell snake oil, she promotes dieting, thus body hatred. But good speech tonite. #GoldenGlobes2018
8480 2018-01-08 03:15:48 Oil diffusers are a game changer

8482 2018-01-08 03:15:13 the next award show should honor Martha Stewart and have her read her most legendary tweets on stage the entire time ... Oil
8483 2018-01-08 03:15:03 Geography and local resources dictate the price of commodities. Gas is expensive in Norway because there is no oil in Norway, and it's difficult to import due to its geography.
8484 2018-01-08 03:14:59 So we can all agree, if nothing is going to fix the team this year, keep everyone on board and ride it out until the offseason. Nobody loses their job.
8485 2018-01-08 03:14:52 I opened essential oils I got for Christmas but I have no idea how to use them so now my room just smells like tea tree oil and it's way too potent
8486 2018-01-08 03:14:52 I'm multi-tasking here listening to this exalted word Oprah is trying to bless us with while being distracted by her luxurious hair that looks like she bathes regularly in argan oil and Jamaican castor oil
8487 2018-01-08 03:14:51 Is that because prices are linked to oil rather than spot?
8488 2018-01-08 03:14:47 I’m really making jollof for the Black Panther premier. No jokes. Bringing it in a palm oil stained plastic bowl too.
8489 2018-01-08 03:14:44 Thank her for WHAT? What has she or Trump have done? Just empty promises. US wanted to get more money and oil out of mullas and they are paying. 2009 all over again.

8495 2018-01-08 03:13:47 start putting oil or a greasy lotion on while you’re still in the shower. that way when you dry off, there’s residual moisture.

8500 2018-01-08 03:13:09 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
8501 2018-01-08 03:13:04 When washing your face, use warm water ? if the water is too hot, you risk washing away too much oil and drying out your skin.
8502 2018-01-08 03:12:57 If you do oil I cant imagine how long it will take you with how ocd you are But it would turn out soso good

8507 2018-01-08 03:11:59 Well i guess i love you now and ur my favorite if the back has a 6ball were cooking with oil
8508 2018-01-08 03:11:53 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
8509 2018-01-08 03:11:47 But I’m pro CBD oil for sure.
8510 2018-01-08 03:11:41 No one is free of blame but when the coach said he had no answers for a historically bad PK, he basically signed his own walking papers IMO.
8511 2018-01-08 03:11:22 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
8512 2018-01-08 03:11:22 Was this a load of ilegal oil heading to NKO?

8519 2018-01-08 03:10:53 He and Trump and Haley are just talk. They just want more $, Oil well, and.... from mullas and mullas are more than willing to pay. Iranians should NEVER trust US as a friend they proved it in 1979 when they backstab Shah.

8526 2018-01-08 03:10:10 You're being fair if you are including asphalt road surfaces, plastic materials and fabrics, drugs, feedstocks. Petrochemicals is not the same as fossil fuels -- we don't burn everything made out of oil and natural gas. Not all wood we harvest is used as firewood, either.

8537 2018-01-08 03:08:03 Problem w/ you and I, is we see things completely different. Imo, effort isn't an issue but confidence is. You think the roster is better than I do and b/c of it we have no common ground. But to answer your question, get better players.

8540 2018-01-08 03:07:22 It was super simple. I took a whole avocado and put it in my ninja blender. Then I added some fresh garlic, a TINY bit of lemon and 3 tablespoons of Ex virgin olive oil. Blended that all and then added a tablespoon of water at a time to get the consistency I like.

8551 2018-01-08 03:04:18 .@NextRevFNC .@SteveHiltonx  Why devote a Swampwatch segment to oil & gas industry, which seems to do business efficiently & virtuously for the benefit of working citizens & the republic. Where's the corruption? Industry provides cheap gasoline, cheap heating gas & good jobs.
8552 2018-01-08 03:04:02 Sounds good but sesame oil could negate the diet factor if you use a lot. I want the tofu!
8553 2018-01-08 03:03:56 This is going to harm these beautiful polar bears, Dolphins, whales, & much more wildlife. I hate they did this. It seems to me they have enough oil. Also the Trump Admin has rolled back regulations,( i.e. deepwater horizon). I Pray another explosion doesn't happen.

8768 2018-01-08 02:33:17 So looks like the plan for tomorrow is to get the oil changed in my car before the winter weather starts up in the afternoon.

8776 2018-01-08 02:32:44 I wish I could cook with avocado oil.
8777 2018-01-08 02:32:39 It was mesmerizing. So fitting to tell Van Gogh’s story in the style of his paintings. #10 in my Top 10 of last year. It’s the very first ever oil painted film with 65,000 painted frames. It was released this past September. Currently screening at the Landmark West End in NW DC.

8779 2018-01-08 02:32:30 The only person that tells you they're a genius is the guy selling snake oil out of the back of a truck. The people that believe him are the sad ones. Some day they'll realize they were duped. I can only hope their hair hasn't fallen out from drinking the snake oil.

8786 2018-01-08 02:31:46 Coco deserves the win. Equally true is Loving Vincent should have a category of its own. “Each of the film's 65,000 frames is an oil painting on canvas, using the same technique as Van Gogh, created by a team of 125 painters.”
8787 2018-01-08 02:31:44 Pls don’t say “Congress” when you obviously mean R’s.

8803 2018-01-08 02:29:52 Loving Vincent is a film where every frame is an oil painting.  Coco was great, but Loving Vincent is a true achievement in cinema.

8833 2018-01-08 02:24:05 1) Oil doesn't compete with UST's as a reserve asset like gold does, and 2) Not sure why you're so willing to ignore a pronounced, emphatic, sustained reversal of a 40-yr downtrend.  Maybe you're right, maybe it's nothing.  Chinese authorities say its not, but guess we'll see.

8836 2018-01-08 02:23:52 I’ve lathered my entire body in coconut oil and I’ve had 8 glasses of water every day for the past week, and yet I still have anxiety and acne. wtf 2018??

8840 2018-01-08 02:23:03 While Coco is brilliant and beautiful, LOVING VINCENT TOOK SO MANY ARTISTS AND OIL PAINTINGS LIKE ARE YOU KIDDING #GoldenGlobes
8841 2018-01-08 02:22:53 So, cook it in olive oil worn Salt and pepper then build a sauce worth a lot of garlic, sriracha, honey, like 3 limes, and some Fireball then have it re cook to add flavour. 
That's an expensive way to make something kinda taste like Fireball but mostly Sriracha and garlic.
8842 2018-01-08 02:22:50 So who wanna recommend some things I can use to get my skin back on track? Except coconut oil and aloe Vera.  yk like things mi can just go buy.
8843 2018-01-08 02:22:48 Bullshit. Loving Vincent was GORGEOUS. It was an actual oil painted film. Never been done before. Ever. But sure, give the award to Pixar. #GoldenGlobes2018
8844 2018-01-08 02:21:57 Place several tablespoons of dried wormwood leaves and flowers in a jar, cover with light olive oil and seal. Let this steep for several weeks in a cool place, strain and use as an anointing oil for yourself or your divination tools.

8846 2018-01-08 02:21:08 The greatest democracy? Oh please. You have a two party system where both parties do the bidding of big money, resulting in wars and oil spills. Trump is a symptom, not the disease.
8847 2018-01-08 02:21:02 You've been lied to. 
For years. 
By oil companies.

Not climatologists. 
Who make $50,000/yr.

8857 2018-01-08 02:19:16 1- In the oil business, we have a situation similar to this: A decline in inventories after a build, a build after a decline.  In the chart, the last ten years are merely covering the earlier 10 years.  If this trend continues and crosses the peak, you have a compelling case.

8866 2018-01-08 02:18:42 100% but for the collective, it's not the issue. Simply put the roster isn't good enough & everything hasn't broken in their favour this year.
8867 2018-01-08 02:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
8868 2018-01-08 02:17:45 Mine didn’t hurt at all if you get it and it does get infected put tea tree oil on it, it worked great for me! Only took 2 weeks to fully heal and it doesn’t get caught on nothing easiest piercing I’ve got
8869 2018-01-08 02:17:34 Productores de comodities de G&Oil apuestan a la baja en el precio del barril p los prox. 5 años. O sea venden futuros a precios + bajos q ahora. Y los especuladoes estan del otro lado comprando. Ergo es muy probable q de aca al 2022 el precio WTI esté en baja.

8881 2018-01-08 02:16:10 Just saved 500$ by fixing my car myself, something people need to learn. I got homies who pay for an oil change 
8882 2018-01-08 02:16:06 Despite conflicts, our friends at @SoonerPoll are at it again. As a tool to push #HammScam at #okleg, they’ll soon present anti-wind poll result. If they wanted accurate assessment, they’d ask the following: "Should #windpower pay 2-5x tax burden of oil?" That’s what it is today.

8900 2018-01-08 02:11:44 So what's the answer for the Oil anyway?
8901 2018-01-08 02:11:33 I do know that for clown makeup & heavy stage makeup its best to put down a layer of grease/vegetable shortening or cold cream first, and then use the cold cream to get it off after. Probably coconut oil would work perfectly then too.
8902 2018-01-08 02:11:23 I put ACV, teal’s coconut oil epsom salt, pink Himalayan salt, and lavender oil in the tub
8903 2018-01-08 02:11:14 you stream an uterus to be their hallowed pyre worse than a slit beyond your oil dandled
8904 2018-01-08 02:11:00 The Globalist, Rothchild's are 500 Trillion more wealthy. They have control banks whole world except 3 countries. They want world making wars, wanting oil & coil.

8909 2018-01-08 02:09:52 wish I had a garage so I could change my own got damn oil cus I don’t feel like waiting a lightyear for a mechanic to do it ugh
8910 2018-01-08 02:09:05 He warned them. Gave them a year to get their act together with North Korea, and they're still allowing oil to be transferred ship to ship to North Korea.

8925 2018-01-08 02:06:54 I keep reading how good nooch is on popcorn, have I been #vegan long enough to call it nooch yet? lol ..had to try it, popped in coconut oil, sprinkled nooch & pink salt. At first I didn’t like it but a few bites later my brain decided it tasted like white cheddar, growing on me.
8926 2018-01-08 02:06:53 put some oil or something
8927 2018-01-08 02:06:44 Fair points, mind you I think there are a few guys who's effort level could be better at times
8928 2018-01-08 02:06:42 We put peanut oil in our pup’s food and it works wonders. About a teaspoon. Good luck.
8929 2018-01-08 02:06:31 Mortadella - prosciutto - salumi di Parma. Range of flavors & textures. Cheeses are manchego, mozzarella, Brie . Added arugula, pickled onions, and kalamata olives as counterpoints. With the good olive oil & balsamic dipping bowls
8930 2018-01-08 02:06:30 It really is ...I stopped I'm good now ppl think it's cool cause it's weed in food form etc! But truth be told  the oil works wonders on cancer patients... plus they selling that gmo non seeded weed in California lately can't trust this government or 45 they out to get the ppl

8935 2018-01-08 02:05:24 In agreement with @malcolmbrodie   As consumers we should be getting the best bang for our buck considering what the oil companies rake in. #Abbotsford should do the same as #Richmond

8940 2018-01-08 02:04:20 In my mind, a public flogging is counterproductive, especially coming from the head coach and/or captain. Also, I don't see Oilers struggles as an effort issue & never have. Just my two cents.
8941 2018-01-08 02:04:19 mine is really bad this year too, i actually went to the doctor about it and she gave me the aquaphor and some oil that helped so much and antibiotics. she also said like limiting different kinds of soaps and just using one moisturizing soap and make that all you use.
8942 2018-01-08 02:04:17 Yeah I put the bacon on the bottom. Sprinkle some dry Italian seasoning w/ olive oil on top, then add the tenderloin. I add more seasoning on the top, 1.5 - 2 packs of Good Seasons altogether. (You could just use Italian dressing instead.)
8943 2018-01-08 02:04:16 Kim Jong Un is picking the wrong American President to threaten. If it was POTUS44, well then it would be a great idea. 44 would just roll over and play dead. 45... you get your oil import cut off. Your supplier’s ship first get impounded, if that doesn’t work, burned in high sea

8948 2018-01-08 02:03:21 I think an abundant oil field would add to the landscape. Don’t you, Zinke?

8972 2018-01-08 02:00:32 OIL DIFF: 6.41 -> 6.44
8973 2018-01-08 02:00:27 Build a wall along the Mexican border, muck up the shores with more oil drilling, kill hibernating bears, give rich people tax cuts, and equate marijuana use to heroine. This should solve all of our problems.
8974 2018-01-08 02:00:26 What? Huh? Oil? Who said something about Oil.. bitch you cooking?
8975 2018-01-08 02:00:24 Black seed oil

8985 2018-01-08 01:58:41 To define my curls I use eco styler gel with flaxseed oil on wet hair but I put Jamaican black castor oil on there first.

8988 2018-01-08 01:58:00 Rask bashers shift to quiet mode, go back to sipping on fish oil.

8991 2018-01-08 01:57:28 Meanwhile in oil country.... Darryl Katz’s 60$ million dollar private jet departs for Palm Springs.

8993 2018-01-08 01:57:16 Help I used coconut oil then got in the bath and now I'm all slippery and I can't get out
8994 2018-01-08 01:57:14  getting oil out the ground is not destroying the earth.  Are u concerned about drilling in other countries for oil?  Does it only destroy the planet when we drill domestically? We need more solar/wind energy, but we aren’t there yet. We still need oil 
8995 2018-01-08 01:57:03 Hillary - Uranium. Bill - Oil. UN - Oil for Food. How many more...
8996 2018-01-08 01:57:02 One objectively discusses issues regarding government policies and oil price, while another subjectively talks about society and poverty considering its emotion. How interesting that both have similar level of intelligence.
8997 2018-01-08 01:57:00 The thousands of Homeless people plaguing downtown Seattle  might want a well paying job on an oil rig. 
8998 2018-01-08 01:56:46 Coconut oil is the solution to all problems. Don’t argue with me on this.
8999 2018-01-08 01:56:43 Ive used pure olive oil, liv grosses me out!  Thinking I might try sheamoisture kids, (we use their head to toe body wash now) eden bodyworks kids, or honey baby natural....
9000 2018-01-08 01:56:17 前勤出勤前だから時間帯無配置かな？
9001 2018-01-08 01:56:08 We are able just not allowed. NJ is a small state. I’ve pumped gas many times. I can also check my oil, tire pressure and change a tire. My parents taught me when I was learning how to drive. Why would you think they didn’t? I have no desire to pump my own gas, ever.
9002 2018-01-08 01:55:49 Drowning myself in coconut oil and exfoliating is def one of my fav weekend activities
9003 2018-01-08 01:55:43 I wish somebody told me black castor oil the best for beards.... aint want a nigga to win 
9004 2018-01-08 01:55:37 Whoever wants to spend their hard earned cash to buy property on a crappy oil field in the middle of the desert is out of their mind!!!
9005 2018-01-08 01:55:17 Went to Target for lip oil, and instead came out with the essentials: chocolate hazelnut Oreos and a narwhal sheet mask 
9006 2018-01-08 01:55:15 Arnica oil and pills for Natalie tonight

9013 2018-01-08 01:53:52 The team? It would seem silly for your coach and or Captain to throw the entire team under the bus publicly. I think they need someone like Kruger to come back and work with these guys.
9014 2018-01-08 01:53:51 Data is the New Oilと言われているけれど、冷静に考えるとオイルだけあってもエンジンが普及していないと役に立ちませんわな。。。#データとデザイン
9015 2018-01-08 01:53:44 I'm seeing a lot of people in very real trouble paying heating bills, buying oil, and etc.
9016 2018-01-08 01:53:39 I got a game over a bunch of times on that boss because I couldn't get up out of the oil after falling reliably
9017 2018-01-08 01:53:34 I need to be rubbed down butt naked head to toe with some hot coconut oil, nothing sexual it’s just well needed 
9018 2018-01-08 01:53:31 Same people up there tonight don't want women to have guns for self-protection.
9019 2018-01-08 01:53:18 My skin type is so different than yours so I understand! Have you tried jojoba oil, Shea oil, or sweet almond oil to moisturize your skin?
9020 2018-01-08 01:53:07 I gotta get this shower together.
bought a facial oil that got me feeling like Heaven..

9021 2018-01-08 01:52:33 あそこは無配置ですか
9022 2018-01-08 01:52:23 Hey @reblavoie, I love the Kopari coconut melt but.. I tried a jar of coconut oil from the grocery store and it looks and feels exactly the same 
9023 2018-01-08 01:52:06 Oh yeah, you mean like Sweden? Who has no oil and still mysteriously manages to do pretty fucking well despite their horrendous socialist ailment? Or hmm Iceland? No oil there either. On the redder side too. Happy bunch. Yup, your logic is impeccable.
9024 2018-01-08 01:52:02 Coconut oil is the best thing invented.
9025 2018-01-08 01:51:53 I did use a lot of really basic stuff for a few months over the summer and up until a few months ago but I just never got the results I wanted. I’m sticking with coconut oil eye makeup remover though and I do like witch hazel as a toner when I need one & to refresh before makeup
9026 2018-01-08 01:51:51 Pa change oil? Haha
9027 2018-01-08 01:51:45 ポプテピピックおもしろいやん
車をエンジンかけずに重力だけで動かして追いかけるシーン最高だったわ
9028 2018-01-08 01:51:30 Using castor oil in your everyday routine helps as well. It’s also good to thicken edges, eyebrows, and eyelash growth 
9029 2018-01-08 01:51:16 何でこんな人多いの
9030 2018-01-08 01:51:13 What are the chances that we will learn these lessons from LNG...
Unfortunately ...low. From the overexpansion of railways at the turn of the century to the current proposals for building more new oil pipelines than needed, Canada has been making the same mistake over and over
9031 2018-01-08 01:50:49 John Rockefeller was behind the propaganda for alcohol and marijuana prohibition as he saw ethanol as a threat to the oil industry and hemp as a threat to the timber industry. It's always been about the money
9032 2018-01-08 01:50:47 i say that to say this, you don't put the same oil in a Lexus that you do in a Nissan.
9033 2018-01-08 01:50:42 I had my doubts about facial oils - but no more!  Combat #EminenceWinter with Facial Recovery Oil!
9034 2018-01-08 01:50:39 Spoiler alert: it's coconut oil.
9035 2018-01-08 01:50:34 Senator:  Please list the daily oil spills in the US.  I can only think of a few major oil spill accidents in my 67 year life span.  Time to stop the BS.  Get to work to make the US Energy Independent to create millions of jobs.  JM
9036 2018-01-08 01:50:33 Oil Ocean Act 2's boss? It's a thousand times harder for Knuckles because of his lower jump height It was not built with him in mind. You have to play so much more cleanly in order to get past it and it sucks so much. Not a good boss
9037 2018-01-08 01:50:17 The heat soaks the oil into the freeway tar, but the first rain makes that very slick. It is a hazard, added to the intense speed of traffic, tail-gating, and distractions. Many accidents will happen tomorrow.
9038 2018-01-08 01:50:04 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
9039 2018-01-08 01:49:41 Woot! I've got one of those!
9040 2018-01-08 01:49:37 Worst way to end a weekend? Accidentally knocking over my @josie_maran argan oil while putting it on #golddownthedrain #somadatmyself #cantlivewithoutargon
9041 2018-01-08 01:49:11 Keep it going...
9042 2018-01-08 01:49:09 The HASK deep conditioning packets are amazing. I use the Argan one if I’m planning on straightening my hair and either the Coconut oil or coconut milk and honey one if I’m leaving It curly.

9045 2018-01-08 01:48:40 So I bought raw chicken, defrosted dat shit, pounded them into evenly thin slices, covered them with flour then raw egg and then panko breadcrumbs, and then fried them in oil. My sources say they looked and tasted really good so yay. I DID IT!! I’m a grown up now.
9046 2018-01-08 01:48:30 It’s what happens when you drink your own kool-aid. Or drop acid. They’re pushing the limits of reality. 
9047 2018-01-08 01:48:18  what kind of oil?
9048 2018-01-08 01:48:09 Makeup wearing people - I recently discovered that coconut oil on a rag removes my makeup faster and more thoroughly than any makeup remover I've used. Is this a common knowledge thing and I was just late to the party?
9049 2018-01-08 01:48:05 I am literally so lazy that I don’t wanna put lotion on. So immediately after I take a shower I run a bath, put baby oil in it, sit in the water for about a good 5–10 minutes get out towel dry
9050 2018-01-08 01:47:56 So she's a instagram model, she gets off the phone w/ the L.A. dude and just starts looking at herself in her phone camera and starts doing her hair putting oil in it and spraying it. She was so self absorbed, but she stopped talking, so i was happy.
9051 2018-01-08 01:47:54 Lmao funny enough is weed oil in it too
9052 2018-01-08 01:47:53 Per their recipes you put oil into the rub/marinade/seasoning HOWEVER I did not on this chicken, I battered it as regular and it came out fine. 

I tried some chicken tenders previously per their recipe and it came out fine as well.
9053 2018-01-08 01:47:53 Palm oil has remained as one of commodities that came under the spotlight in 2017. Indonesia’s top dollar earner, bringing in Rp239 trillion into the treasury in 2019, palm oil has always been a subject of controversy. Here are the five top most popular Palm Oil issues in 2017.

9072 2018-01-08 01:45:05 They have achieved it in Venezuela. Second largest oil reserves and people stand in queues for toilet rolls
9073 2018-01-08 01:44:45 I used oil and let it sit on. The extensions came out but I still had some chunks of glue in so I had to brush those out.
9074 2018-01-08 01:44:33 It would be interesting to see a comparison to oil drilling maps.
9075 2018-01-08 01:44:23 What is a good oil for your hair? I hate coconut oil btw
9076 2018-01-08 01:44:22 Ima get some bubba rope, change the oil, then we’ll be good to go. We gotta find spots too!
9077 2018-01-08 01:44:19 Fingers are freezing (still on the rink) and off to watch Hollywood elistists congratulate them selves). BTW I'm a leftists, pro government. environmentalist, feminist, atheist and generally a nice guy (IOW not some crazy big oil and big corp guy) end.

9084 2018-01-08 01:43:03 Iranian oil tanker still ablaze after collision off China's coast
9085 2018-01-08 01:42:58 My career at McDonalds was from the age of 15 to the age of 15.  Too young to work the grill so they allowed me to work the vats of hot oil frying fries, Filet O Fish, McNuggets & the amazing volcanic fried pies.

I drank more Sprite that summer than any human through possible.
9086 2018-01-08 01:42:55 I remember walking the beach 10 years still getting clumps of oil tar stuck o your feet, going home to use oliva oil to work the oil tar off your feet....If will happen again, build smaller tankers and have smaller spills ?
9087 2018-01-08 01:42:55 got all list 8 #MAGA 
9088 2018-01-08 01:42:34 Nope.  I can’t wait until they start drilling in Anwar!    Se need to get off our dependence on foreign oil.
9089 2018-01-08 01:42:26 I think the days of 20 sacks are over for Houston. Appeared to be leaking oil at the end this season after a strong start. He obviously still has value here, but not sure at that number

9091 2018-01-08 01:42:15 Hey @FatKidDeals you got any deals on oil rubbed bronze shower heads? I got prime!
9092 2018-01-08 01:42:08 Funny how y’all Republicans are all about cutting down federal government regulations when it comes to charging us more for internet/regulating banks/oil but not when it comes to filling privatized for-profit prisons with people doing marijuana legally under their states’ laws.
9093 2018-01-08 01:42:00 Oil definitely should have a sin tax
9094 2018-01-08 01:41:58 Meal prep for the week: 
Asparagus in olive oil w/ salt & pepper 
New Orleans mix veg in olive oil w/ Cajun spices 
Cajun  blackened salmon 
Lemon pepper chicken breasts 
Whole grain brown rice (boring, I know)
9095 2018-01-08 01:41:49 Bale is back but the other chimps have already given up. I love zz but his bald head needs some coconut oil to reboot, refresh and rehash.

9098 2018-01-08 01:40:25 So true, it doesn't matter what he does it will never be enough.  I am in the minority, I know, but I actually liked that trade.  I also think that I may own the only Larsson jersey in all of Oil Country :)
9099 2018-01-08 01:40:12 Yep, not buying the cover story. I'd be okay if we . It was Iranian oil ship, right? Probably  on its way to N*K*
9100 2018-01-08 01:40:10 Endless oil story
9101 2018-01-08 01:40:06 Per VP Pence on MSNBC last week announced they're back in Afghanistan to liberate the country. Imagine if Afghanistan has oil, they'd be in bigger trouble....
9102 2018-01-08 01:40:02 coconut oil
9103 2018-01-08 01:39:39 Hopefully we don't have another oil disaster in the ocean, I have zero confidence in the Chinese or Iranian government to clean it up with the same skill and Effectiveness as the United States or a wealthy Western European country
9104 2018-01-08 01:39:38 Offensive? We’ve let in 20 goals over 5 games. That reaches far beyond offensive struggles. Sure the Oil aren’t scoring in droves here, but you can’t win with a 4.00 GAA.
9105 2018-01-08 01:39:14 Mr Pai, Which is bigger evil "Oil from middle east" or "solar panels from China"? I think its former, we can build solar panels but not dig oil wells. Let's become energy Independent first then think of building indigenous capacity!
9106 2018-01-08 01:39:07 もう外に出てきてますがクソ寒いです(((((;;･ω･))))) これで雨降ったらホント辛い…
9107 2018-01-08 01:39:02 #IranProtests Time to impose sanctions on Iranian oil! Obviously Iranians aren't skilled enough to sail in the South China due to poor training and inept abilities in seamanship. They can't navigate the sea without hitting Chinese cargo ships and polluting the ocean #NoIranianOil
9108 2018-01-08 01:38:51 I cannot wait to shower and use that body oil
9109 2018-01-08 01:38:50 doesnt even matter nothing can really phase me until wenger is gone... weve been down this road so long its all the same... we are like an oil tanker turning while other clubs have been rowboats going from manager to manager
9110 2018-01-08 01:38:40 I can get used to the oil field and the money
9111 2018-01-08 01:38:30 Cringe.
9112 2018-01-08 01:38:11 I think I'm going to finally get the needed oil and try the fish one this week.
9113 2018-01-08 01:38:10 somehow not as bad honestly? like a garage is full of dirt and mud and oil and gasoline and also we had the cats litterbox out here so its just FILLED with shit dust and ugh
9114 2018-01-08 01:37:55 This week I opened a savings account, got my oil changed, took old clothes to Goodwill and cleaned my entire apt. I am officially an adult.
9115 2018-01-08 01:37:30 And what's worse, they'd rather see that oil demand filled by wonderful, free countries like Venezuela, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. I have no patience for people who can't see past their own property line.
9116 2018-01-08 01:37:22 oil well money in the world
9117 2018-01-08 01:36:52 I don’t mind sharing but I don’t measure. I eye ball everything. I sautéed some finely diced onion and garlic in butter and olive oil. Then I added some tomato paste, puréed tomatoes, seasoning and cream at the end.
9118 2018-01-08 01:36:48 SA needs the oil money like the rest do. How long until they say Nuts to the cuts and start pumping enough to meet their budgetary needs and over-supply the market?

9123 2018-01-08 01:35:58 If only that wall was high enough to make USA soldiers not invade small countries and kill thousands of inocents for oil
9124 2018-01-08 01:35:41 All this oil... but no rig...
9125 2018-01-08 01:35:40 Fun facts I just learned. Armie Hammer is named after his grandfather Armand. He was a rich industrialist and oil magnate.

He also bought a significant amount of stock in the company that made Arm & Hammer simply because it sounded like his name. Served on their board.
9126 2018-01-08 01:35:38 NO! He might find more places to offer to his oil and gas “friends”.

9132 2018-01-08 01:34:14 Try mineral oil with an eye dropper and let it sit in there for 5 or so mins  then use soap and water to rinse
9133 2018-01-08 01:34:05 A tanker carrying Iranian oil that collided with a Chinese freight ship in the East China Sea over the weekend was still ablaze on Monday morning, a South Korean coast guard official told Reuters.

9137 2018-01-08 01:33:38 lmao I usually do braids in the summer. but Wild Growth oil is the key to life.
9138 2018-01-08 01:33:30 But it did its best to discourage profit, rendering its various industries toothless. This isn't a bubble that burst, it was choked into submission by socialist economic policies, which was then exploded when Oil fell through.
9139 2018-01-08 01:33:28 Used $100 worth of heating oil in the past 2 weeks  this weather is expensive

9142 2018-01-08 01:33:10 Obviously lol. TE isn’t Aljazeera, it doesn’t have bottomless coffers from oil. Journalists gotta be paid bruh; those Oxford degrees gotta be worth something.

9145 2018-01-08 01:32:20 Nope! (Don’t actually have to soak them for stovetop version either, hence 4 hour cook time on stovetop) instant pot you pre-brown sausages, sauté veg in the resultant oil, add beans & water & re-add meat, cook about 30 mins on high pressure.
9146 2018-01-08 01:32:19 Nah... It'll  dry them out.  Try coconut oil, olive oil, or hand lotion.
9147 2018-01-08 01:32:06 What people miss about natural gas usage in New England is that so much of it is either rural or 2-acre-minimum zoning suburban.  That's an impractical scenario for gas lines, and much better supplied by heating oil.
9148 2018-01-08 01:31:52 I just got Magic mushrooms. I'm so excited. And this THC oil finna be bomb asf
9149 2018-01-08 01:31:50 According to @louisvirtel he's made out of vegetable oil and Nerf. Let me know what that smells like.
9150 2018-01-08 01:31:38 I used coconut oil in mine, too, but the rest of it was olive oil.
9151 2018-01-08 01:31:24 Butter or Coconut oil?
9152 2018-01-08 01:31:15 I can't believe I spent all day waiting for guys from the oil company and I never went to the gym to take a shower
9153 2018-01-08 01:31:12 Use wild grow . Or liv. Orrrrrr olive oil cream. Pure olive oil too.
9154 2018-01-08 01:31:12 Climate Change is real & intentional by Big Oil. There is strategy 2 degrade all American supplies & resources while physical structure of siege is becoming realized.  Without action soon climate will be irretrievable & marshal law inevitable. Enforcement camps 2 b vividly normal
9155 2018-01-08 01:30:39 today i broke one of the oil lamps at cracker barrel and the whole room stopped what they were doing and turned to look at me and it was sunday so everyone was swarming out the hollers. the room was full.

9158 2018-01-08 01:30:23 Her fake hair bun needs some oil
9159 2018-01-08 01:30:03 Pork carnitas (pork shoulder, oranges, lime, cumin, oregano, garlic, salt, pepper, jalapeño, some oil) Either pressure cook or slow cook.  Finish off under the broiler or a quick pan fry.  So delicious and feeds a crowd (or freeze for later!)
9160 2018-01-08 01:29:48 In need of a coconut oil massage
9161 2018-01-08 01:29:43 @Justins I was excited to try your Classic Almond Butter + Pretzels Snack Pack but found the almond had solidified into a block with oil on top. Impossible to dip pretzels. Sad!
9162 2018-01-08 01:29:38 bukannya makin baik malah makin parah. 

Akhirnya nyoba produk yang mahal yaitu tbs, nyoba tea tree oil sama fwnya. Eh hamdalah mayan tuh cocok, brutusan mulai berkurang tapi jerawat masih ada. Tapi lama-kelamaan gak cocok dikantong :)
9163 2018-01-08 01:29:19 I will rejoice the day I see a rich oil magnate from Dubai and come rescue us from these shambles ....I’ve said it time and again wenger is too comfy in his job cuz of the spineless execs smdh #wengerout

9171 2018-01-08 01:28:08 This is not discussed often in Hollywood but Zac Efron is mostly made of vegetable oil and Nerf.
9172 2018-01-08 01:27:55 I'm glad I know how to change my own tire and do my own oil in my car
9173 2018-01-08 01:27:28 Oil on canvass, not on fingers.

9175 2018-01-08 01:26:52 That them there oil hills - @stellaAzella
9176 2018-01-08 01:26:33 people also think not eating animals will solve all of our environmental problems when it’ll just cause a different set  like if you’re vegan for ethical reasons cool but if it’s purely environmental and u also have products w/ palm oil...i need an explanation
9177 2018-01-08 01:26:33 So I’m trying to get some of this Black Seed Oil. @IGorrell
9178 2018-01-08 01:26:27 Bro my fish oil gummies are crack
9179 2018-01-08 01:26:17 I’m an absolute diehard #Oil fan but it’s painful to watch so many guys playing soft on the perimeter. Enough button hooks, soft backhand or attempted saucer passes. If anything, dump puck in and get dirty. Rather lose that way, then trying the same pass it into the net approach
9180 2018-01-08 01:25:55 寒すぎて案の定布団から出れない
9181 2018-01-08 01:25:45 now, the more ppl who know will (hopefully) not 'buy the rapists goods and services' and will then lose the money.
9182 2018-01-08 01:25:34 Tala picked up on their careless mistakes. She finished placing the charges and set them so she could get out and on to her next assignment. But as she began to run quietly back out of the warehouse, she slipped on spilled oil and slid right into one of the guards waking by.
9183 2018-01-08 01:25:24 Eos. Not the annoying ball one but the stick kind. Or one with peppermint oil.
9184 2018-01-08 01:25:12 Same! I’ve been using cetaphil mixed with Olive oil, or just olive oil.. it’s been working well so far!
9185 2018-01-08 01:24:56 What a complete snake oil salesman you are Al. You have no shame at all. Go away.
9186 2018-01-08 01:24:44 that would be the tea tree oil lmao
9187 2018-01-08 01:24:42 Interesting...I have some coconut oil lotion. It's amazing. And some soap with coconut oil base.
9188 2018-01-08 01:24:32 Well that’s good because I’m sick here on the couch, robots just get rusty and need oil to be right again 
9189 2018-01-08 01:24:32 Y energía distribuída? Pingüe negocio les dejó nestor, bajo la mirada de julio y sgo pierro. A ellos y a sus otros amigotes: aggreko, secco, so energy. 2800 MW, 68 centrales entre 3 y 40MW, de base a gas oil importado (300usd/MWh desde 2006!)

9193 2018-01-08 01:23:53 However, I could have sex with two of these four things.
9194 2018-01-08 01:23:46 I started using natural DIY baking soda/coconut oil toothpaste several days ago and it tastes SOOO salty and gross omg but I’m gonna keep using it because normal toothpaste has harsh chemicals and shit.
9195 2018-01-08 01:23:43 can I tell you what coconut oil and patchouli oil have been doing for my skin
9196 2018-01-08 01:23:41 Wow hard not to be fastest growing coming off the bottom. Jobs are with the gov (NDP jobs policy LOL), part time or self employed. We'll see how long $60 Oil lasts& if NG goes negative again on spot this summer cause no one can hedge this year.
Smoke &mirrors recovery.

9197 2018-01-08 01:23:39 For dinner tonight I made stove top popcorn with coconut oil and put salt and cinnamon on it and then covered it in maple syrup #meanwhileincanada #dietoftheyear #ehteam #homeiscanada

9201 2018-01-08 01:22:48 The administration is planning on opening up more offshore drilling immediately after issuing an opinion that corporations should not be liable for killing birds in oil spills.
9202 2018-01-08 01:22:47 So many easy recipes to try out there. I use it for cooking brown rice because it takes forever in a traditional rice cooker. For a while I was making brown rice with coconut milk for the liquid plus 2-3 cloves of garlic, dried spicy peppers, and some coconut oil for flavor.
9203 2018-01-08 01:22:36 lol. and yet, no one said anything until now.
9204 2018-01-08 01:22:35 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.
9205 2018-01-08 01:22:18 Do you guys ever get positive replies, from anything other then oil rig workers? We get it guys, they pay you well, still doesn’t mean you’re doing a good thing.
9206 2018-01-08 01:22:03 I do! I don’t think my moisturizer is the best for my skin then. I’m going to try vitamin E oil that I just ordered.
9207 2018-01-08 01:21:59 Some people are sensitive to coconut oil - I am. It xan actually dry you out, so in soaps, it's recommended not to use more than 15 - 20% by weight. #Funfacts
9208 2018-01-08 01:21:43 Wow, I have been waiting for oil delivery since Thursday.  Going to run out any minute.  Have been on hold now over an hour. Customer since 1980.  Will be looking for new company.
9209 2018-01-08 01:21:35 Bro just go to the doc and get some pills. You gonna be coughing up Black Oil from @thexfiles if you don't get that taken care of.
9210 2018-01-08 01:21:35 If we pull out our guns now, we still would be the ones in jail. the more you say, the more the rapists who are running the institutions (ur right is true) will (hopefully) "get scared" for a lack of a better word. shoot one, you've only killed one. scare one, you scare them all.
9211 2018-01-08 01:21:27 We're curious. What is your favorite oil and why?
9212 2018-01-08 01:21:16 If you can't tell, I love argan oil. It's the only thing that really tames my thin, frizzy curly/wavy hair. I've used it for years.
9213 2018-01-08 01:21:05 BTW, you can't clean oil from whales or wetlands with soap.
9214 2018-01-08 01:21:01 just got new oil for my diffuser... You Bitches Are Over

9216 2018-01-08 01:20:35 If you love yourself , oil your hair and skin at night
9217 2018-01-08 01:20:33 Feeling "uncomfortable” probably has more to do with the realization “journalist” is right up there with snake oil salesman these days.  The sound of pots & pans banging against your wagon s/b your opening theme.
9218 2018-01-08 01:20:06 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
9219 2018-01-08 01:19:50 PC has left his fingerprints all over this mess of a team, and he has to pay the price. You can’t receive praise when the oil do well, and avoid the fire when they’re absolute shit. This is on him. He gambled this season, and lost big time.
9220 2018-01-08 01:19:47 @nailogical Just put jojoba oil on my cuticles for the first time of today. And daaaaaym! Those bitches be silky. #the10%ofmaleviewers
9221 2018-01-08 01:19:34 I agree, but I think the point is that we're sitting on one of the worlds largest deposits of oil that the whole world needs, yet the industry has been destroyed intentionally by our government.
9222 2018-01-08 01:19:32 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
9223 2018-01-08 01:19:29 b/c if (insert brand here) marketed their goods 1ce, do you think ppl would continue buying? if we talked about sexual assault once would it change anything? trick question, we've talked about ALOT and it's STILL an issue.
9224 2018-01-08 01:19:27 Olive oil, little bit of salt and pepper and parmesan cheese! Makes a great dressing if you're in need and desperate
9225 2018-01-08 01:19:17 He painted oil, softly, working lights and shadows. He was not a pointillist. He was a realist.

9228 2018-01-08 01:18:39 With a small population and massive oil revenue for many years, there can never be a comparison to us, especially with our “culture of NO” to pipelines etc. They have no problem building dams and pipelines in Norway. They have an Oil extraction economy.

9241 2018-01-08 01:17:22 When I get out of the shower in the morning, before putting on my makeup, I put a little bit of coconut oil on my eyelashes & directly under my eyes. It helps my mascara go on smoothly & my under eye concealer to sit well. That might help you. 
9242 2018-01-08 01:16:42 Coconut oil
9243 2018-01-08 01:16:41 I don't make it from scratch. I'm not a baker. I like the Krusteaz brand of corn bread. You just add an egg, milk and some vegetable oil. I find it's less dry than other brands.

9247 2018-01-08 01:15:19 okay oil
9248 2018-01-08 01:15:14 It's okay. For home made it's boiled like a pasta then add a bit of butter or oil so they dont stick together. If you want to make it crispy then sautee to add a crunch
9249 2018-01-08 01:15:04 OMG I just spit my tea out.  “He’s no oil painting.”  HAHAHAHA.

9285 2018-01-08 01:08:33 Look, if it is just the economic provisions, discrete portions like that, go ahead, even a wash grease and change oil is fine. But a total overhaul—please, the car is running and posting the highest growth rate in the region.

9290 2018-01-08 01:08:02 anyway i took a long shower today and shaved my legs and changed my sheets and put oil in my hair i feel so freeeeesh
9291 2018-01-08 01:07:49 Omg i have extremely oily skin and this winter i legit have been using oil on my face bc its so dryy
9292 2018-01-08 01:07:38 Google search said I should use “veal-friendly spices.” I went with cinnamon, thyme, cardamom, silk chili, saffron, cumin, salt, cambodian pepper spikes, garlic, olive oil. Too much?
9293 2018-01-08 01:07:24 If you’re having dry skin, I recommend the @SheaMoisture 100% virgin coconut oil line. Like the face line,
The body wash and lotion, I got it today and I’ve never felt more soft and actually moisturized it doesn’t just sit on your skin. 10/10
9294 2018-01-08 01:07:23 Eu vou numa dermato da minha mãe agora, e vamos ver se como vai ser. N sabia desses oil free, vou procurar! Obrigada! E o sol é até ruim pras manchas :(
9295 2018-01-08 01:07:22 I know NOTHING about motors, but my plan was to build the ranch out first, and then get into motors. But I can’t wait, and get frustrated that I don’t have all the knowledge yet when it comes to my equipment up here... anything beyond changing belts, pumps, oil, etc... I’m lost.
9296 2018-01-08 01:07:16 If they were smart enough to know that bottled water comes from lakes and rivers, they would be so stupid as to run oil and gas pipelines through them.

9301 2018-01-08 01:04:52 Interesting chart. could this be due to existing infrastructure in the industry? It would be difficult to pitch new investment into oil and gas in Canada currently.

9306 2018-01-08 01:03:57 I loathe truffle oil and I’m a foodie. I’d rather eat zit oil.
9307 2018-01-08 01:03:40 Why do they or we need more awareness? 

It was an open "secret", everyone knew the rapists were running the institutions and nobody did anything about it because it would cost them money.

It's just another method for them to preach at us for something they themselves are doing.
9308 2018-01-08 01:03:37 I don’t know any particularly. But a lighter moisturizer will be best. Don’t use any that are very thick, it’ll add to the oil.
9309 2018-01-08 01:03:29 My gf wants candles in OUR room, but bought me an oil diffuser for Christmas. Girl....we not using candles in our room 
9310 2018-01-08 01:03:26 I think so. It's just clove oil, but I would Google it first.
9311 2018-01-08 01:03:05 Reductions in use of Canola for biofuel will likely have large impact in Canola demand overall, this may have an impact on $ if EU stays as large purchaser for culinary oil & stockfeed. Their size relative to other markets (ie. Asia) will also be important.

9313 2018-01-08 01:02:55 The Oil and Gas industry, which he and the Democrats oppose, fixed the economy, and the healthcare he gave Americans could still get expensive if used.

That being said, I do miss having an actual leader and articulate president
9314 2018-01-08 01:02:53 Yes it does have a strong taste, so does olive oil. You should try the vegan butter, it’s a little pricey but works pretty well. And the refined coconut oil doesn’t have as strong as a taste, I think.
9315 2018-01-08 01:02:36 There is no way there should be any more oil & gas exploration in any case - anywhere! Fossil fuels are finished!

9323 2018-01-08 01:01:13 Just as well we only buy good quality Italian olive oil.

9325 2018-01-08 01:01:06 I just spoke to my family in RI-the oil company is telling them that they are out of oil. They called last Wednesday to have it delivered and were told it would be there tomorrow-that's five days-temp those days: 23, 9, 6, 3, -2. Why isn't this in the news? Where is the oil?
9326 2018-01-08 01:01:05 I'm looking for good marketers and people with no concern for product value to help me build a company.  I haven't finalized the name yet, but I'm considering "Snake Oil Audio" as our name.

9327 2018-01-08 01:00:40 OIL DIFF: 6.4 -> 6.46
9328 2018-01-08 01:00:32 Olive, jojoba, and sweet almond oils are all wonderful elixirs for hair. If your hair is thick and heavy, coconut oil works wonders.
9329 2018-01-08 01:00:32 I’d drink castor oil first.
9330 2018-01-08 01:00:10 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
9331 2018-01-08 00:59:58 I also highly recommend using a badger brush and soap, with a double-edge safety razor or a full on straight razor for your shaves. Use a pre-shave oil and hot towel as well... it is zen like. Very meditative.
9332 2018-01-08 00:59:52 And there is now no fine per gallon to the companies if there is a spill. 45 made that change for his oil buddies.

9334 2018-01-08 00:59:40 #Oil: We keep our neutral stance as we expect crude oil to trade close to its fair  value range of 45-55 USD.

9338 2018-01-08 00:59:38 For sure and would've been fine with RNH and Leon as well. To be fair, McLellan hasn't gone to that well that often in some time but things have been rather grim of late on the scoring front.
9339 2018-01-08 00:59:31 It's always been about the oil....
9340 2018-01-08 00:59:28 Tip for 3c-4c curly girls:

If your edges won’t lay easily, put some oil on them before you apply edge control.
9341 2018-01-08 00:59:24 I will eat it's flesh and down it with caustic motor oil
9342 2018-01-08 00:59:23 Huge decline in net long position in #gold and #silver

9343 2018-01-08 00:59:05 It's harmful if done in really cold weather supposedly. It can make your car burn your oil faster, which could eventually cause big problems
9344 2018-01-08 00:59:00 Been using kosher salt, fresh ground pepper, Salt Lick Seasoning, a little garlic powder & onion powder, then brush ‘em with olive oil. Seering them at 500 each side to get that crispy outer. Gonna try that Uncle Chris’ next time.

9347 2018-01-08 00:58:12 I think it would be worth noting Tom's recent track record. He has been calling a for oil to stay/peak in the low $50s for months now. Refuses to up his target despite the fundamentals (continuing large inventory draws) supporting higher prices...
9348 2018-01-08 00:57:47 That’s right, Jim.
9349 2018-01-08 00:57:47 Because he wants the oil, duh.

9359 2018-01-08 00:56:03 @DeptofDefense With the recent transfer of 'oil between Russia and North Korea, it might be possible that Russia is transferring intel on how it affected the elections to NK so that NK could get involved with future attacks on U.S. elections.

9361 2018-01-08 00:55:54 Some mines aren’t even open again. Also, oil is hurting the environment thus hurting the health of others and drives costs up for healthcare

9364 2018-01-08 00:55:34 I would like to try it with something other than coconut oil. It always leaves a strong taste when I bake treats. This time wasn’t so bad, but I made brownies with it and I threw them out. 
9365 2018-01-08 00:55:27 And the coconut oil is great for cleaning out your... System. Enjoy!

9367 2018-01-08 00:55:13 @WilliamShatner I saw u mention u have tinnitus (as I do). Wanted to let u know to consider trying CBD oil. Tests are being conducted, but it is said that it reduces the noise. It already has for me. Lots of information about it if u google.

9371 2018-01-08 00:54:42 Coconut oil is very high on the acnegenic scale. I only use it to remove makeup and wipe it off right away.

9373 2018-01-08 00:53:52 Those loses are unacceptable to the US, ergo US will not invade NK. The US is still in the denial stage of grief, that's when it risks unnecessary escalation. Anger will come, but that'll have pass, as nothing will change. If the 1996 famine didn't break NK, 2018 oil prices won't

9383 2018-01-08 00:51:43 well, it definitely depends what you like/dislike…but for example, I only take vanilla whey protein & I add a banana, peanut butter, coconut oil, flaxseed, chia seeds, oatmeal, etc..you can also even add ice cream. it seriously tastes amazing.

Five, ew.
Six, I imagine the oil wasn't hot. Otherwise bye bye digestive system.

Any work done for money even like mowing your friends yard and they pay you !! Is considered reportable work ! And you must take 10 hrs off
9403 2018-01-08 00:48:40 my car needs an oil change & its alignment 
9404 2018-01-08 00:48:32 remember when oil and hannah got married and then he posted her cheating on him on her own insta..... lmao MOOD
9405 2018-01-08 00:48:25 You prepare a table before me
    in the presence of my enemies.
You anoint my head with oil;
    my cup overflows.
6 Surely your goodness and love will follow me
    all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever .....
9406 2018-01-08 00:48:10 Idk, maybe its not doing anything for my skin and I’m just enjoying something different lol.  But I mix it with castor oil for my beard, and honey for my face, then reapply just aloe on my face after I rinse the aloe and honey off.
9407 2018-01-08 00:48:06 @simpleskin has your simple clear skin oil balancing scrub been discontinued in the UK?
9408 2018-01-08 00:48:05 Sunday Riley sleeping oil !!!!!
9409 2018-01-08 00:48:03 Which the actual problem. Detroit and big oil crippled public transportation in the US, so now it's Uber or angry taxi drivers
9410 2018-01-08 00:47:56 Had to use baby oil to remove some very durable mascara, and now my vision is set to soft focus
9411 2018-01-08 00:47:50 Microwave safe bowl.  No oil or butter needed.  ~4 minutes.  

You can make popcorn salt by pulsing regular salt in a food processor.
9412 2018-01-08 00:47:47 It didn’t look cool in the picture, but that’s in there too lol. The coconut oil/yogurt is supposed to be filling too. We’ll see

9414 2018-01-08 00:47:28 I hate when I do my hair and all the oil leaks through my bonnet unto my pillow 
9415 2018-01-08 00:47:10 You can see the NDP who hate oil and all farmers rubbing their hands in anticipation of a new tax! Enough already!!
9416 2018-01-08 00:46:55 Girls i need advise. What dry shampoo should i buy? I need one that takes away my oil but doesn't leave that horrible white cast and residue! Preferably not too expensive. Thanks! @thataylaa @itsbl0ndie @KathleenLights1 @RawBeautyKristi @SsssamanthaaMUA
9417 2018-01-08 00:46:54 The most ironic part about this is there's no negatives to being wrong. What's the worst case scenario? Our planet is cleaner!? What a nightmare! But keep letting the big oil company sponsored republican politicians tell you it's the end of the world if we fight climate change
9418 2018-01-08 00:46:49 this opens a much bigger can of worms i know, but when ppl use guns for protection, they still sometimes go to jail: Cyntoia Brown, a teenage sex trafficking victim was sentenced to 51 years in jail for shooting her abuser.
9419 2018-01-08 00:46:27 Is it weird to ask for olive oil for a birthday? Asking for a friend

9423 2018-01-08 00:45:32 I have a cold and I can’t really breathe/smell anything, u know. But MAN could I smell my eucalyptus oil when it was, unbeknownst to me, on my hands and I touched the side of my nose beside my eye! WOWZA
9424 2018-01-08 00:45:24 Forgot I had this bath oil. It makes my skin feel soooooo soft
9425 2018-01-08 00:45:11 Well no sure if mi by dem qualify as easier hair, resting before I wash, oil, trim and finger comb (yes I have to rest, it no easy).
9426 2018-01-08 00:45:08 If you actually believe oil and fossil fuels in general are a viable long-term answer to our energy needs, you should hire a tutor to help with that homework of yours...not my place to deal with it.

9435 2018-01-08 00:44:16 When I was a kid they told us fossil fuels came from dinosaurs. Even though I now know this isn't the case every time a I see pictures of dinosaurs I associate them with oil. Indoctrination is lifelong

9444 2018-01-08 00:43:00 I know why!
Thatcher blew our oil money. Norway saved theirs!
9445 2018-01-08 00:42:52 Ya I stopped using the chemical ones so I started using tea tree oil/witch hazel and now I'm screwed cause my skin reacted really badly

9451 2018-01-08 00:42:05 Allegedly Graham accepted 800k as a donation from an oil oligarch in 2016 who has both Russian and U.S citizenship. Hmm...the plot thickens, Lindsey Graham was not even running in any campaign that year.
9452 2018-01-08 00:41:56 @kt_ellis98 thought her zip code was the mileage she had to get her oil changed at and she freaked out
9453 2018-01-08 00:41:53 I put olive oil on pretty much everything when I’m cooking
9454 2018-01-08 00:41:39 FTW.
9455 2018-01-08 00:41:39 They're using CBD oil and cannabis in the treatment of autism now. It's really helping and a lot of better results than normal meds
9456 2018-01-08 00:41:31 2 years ago someone added me to some “moms” group on Facebook. Finally decided to check it out, and if you need to know where to take your puppy for trainnig, the perfect gift for a 11 year old boy, the quickest oil change, or a good face painter, let me know.
9457 2018-01-08 00:41:26 Big Oil:  Yeah we know our quest for obscene profits would lead to this but repairing the damage is what tax dollars are meant for.
9458 2018-01-08 00:41:20 Most oil workers lack the skills and attitude to make a successful transition. Expect more #kudatah marches.
9459 2018-01-08 00:41:14 There's NO such thing as"green" energy.. either it requires oil or foundries for smelting metals plus the acid and lead in batteries..
9460 2018-01-08 00:40:56 I need to change my oil, but I’m too lazy to go get a jack 
9461 2018-01-08 00:40:45 No pictures but wife put together a new grill yesterday and the weather demanded a maiden voyage so we made a strip steak with rosemary truffle oil butter and it was very good.
9462 2018-01-08 00:40:32 Considering slathering my hands in olive oil before I go out but it would probably wreck my glove & blocker: A Dilemma
9463 2018-01-08 00:40:27 @Walmart I should tell you that I decided to take my business elsewhere. Went by the Walmart store and ppl had been in there for hours waiting on oil changes. What a waste of time and totally unprofessional experience
9464 2018-01-08 00:40:26 But Tucker usually has Looney's or snake oil salesmen, that's why he cuts them off.

9468 2018-01-08 00:39:57 You’re free to learn about human biology and medicine, er, no there’s a whole lot of publicly funded research there.

Seriously, that’s meant to avoid snake oil salesmen. Makes sense as a global policy.
9469 2018-01-08 00:39:47 @HaleyBarbour Took lands that were owned by blacks & have oil, through eminent domain and pd the owner penies on th dollar & turn around and let big oil companie take th oil. Gasoling is still at high price in th USA. Look for court cases. @maddow @kcdc @MSNBC

9473 2018-01-08 00:39:08 I would like to say thank you for Black Mammoth. I am not Sioux, but the pipeline has affected my tribe in Arizona (Apache). Fuck corporate and greedy oil companies. I am glad someone actually elaborated on this topic. This was also released on my Birthday, it just hits home.
9474 2018-01-08 00:38:41 You should learn how to read a balance sheet.  Your noses are running from the obsequious crap that you are trying to sell.  Your hero is no greater than a carnival barker snake oil salesperson... Don't be fooled
9475 2018-01-08 00:38:29 does it really work tho? Like you’ve used it? I’ve bareky started to use bio oil
9476 2018-01-08 00:38:25 well both obama and trump *have* opened the oceans outside the Cali coast mansions for oil drilling, after all

9488 2018-01-08 00:36:27 Seriously! I so agree! I mean you are with Diana and dreaming about Lois?! What. The. Heck.  It made him look like such an ass and I seriously hated how he treated Diana about the oil plant and other things like that.
9489 2018-01-08 00:36:20 i started throwin oil away, never used it for anything did you? thrw like 170 of em, never used it once
9490 2018-01-08 00:36:06 Playing devil advocate - maybe if they will have their own currency that's backed by oil + erc20 tokens they will may build their economy?
9491 2018-01-08 00:36:04 I wish i can buy new skin like how these females be buying booties and boobs. I’d spend my whole savings on some new skin. My skin so dry and i stay ashy in winter! No matter how much lotion, baby oil and Vaseline i put on wake up pure white in the morning.
9492 2018-01-08 00:35:58 Oil have you aggravated af I'm glad I left that shit alone
9493 2018-01-08 00:35:32 I just read that Sec Interior is fucken dumb hes approved oil drilling in the Santa Channel.  Who cleans the mess this time around? I see hes going to sell your rich buddies massive sections of our National Parks.  Neither of care what Americans think and a neutered Sen w allow.
9494 2018-01-08 00:35:17 One more attack on the environment by this Administration. My guess if you checked a list of Republican Money Donors I suspect will find a complete list of Oil and Gas Companies.

9496 2018-01-08 00:35:07 It's an independent nation and can do any sort of deal with China. China can stock the entire country. They'll do it. He has to move away from USD. There's more revenues inside than oil exports.

9498 2018-01-08 00:34:57 It would be interesting if South Korea would acknowledge if that shipment was heading to them, as the story says. I read an article that says SK does import a lot of that type of oil from Iran.
9499 2018-01-08 00:34:52 I need 80hrs of sleep, a sheet mask, a black head strip, my hair needs to be taken out, washed, a hot oil treatment & deep conditioned, my ends need to be trimmed, my teeth need to be whitened, and my nails need to be done but I have 4 dollars so....

9505 2018-01-08 00:34:20 I occasionally like to test my smoke alarm by warming olive oil on the stove. Then, I can experience realistic panic as smoke billows, my cats freak out, and the alarm goes off repeatedly.  Very effective technique.
9506 2018-01-08 00:34:15 I interviewed with an oil company for a management position. I arrived in nice business attire. My contact asked about night clubs. I said no. He didn't believe me. Asked if I could drive a truck. Could have had one if I was. My uncle offered me a new one. I declined interview.
9507 2018-01-08 00:34:13 Is it really acne though if you only get 1 pimple a week lol..
I only get breakouts if i touch my face. Cos I have oily skin. tea tree oil works great on skin. Also Proactiv. I use Proactiv everyday.
9508 2018-01-08 00:33:41 Maybe for a two line Chicago team, they could've tried RNH/Draisaitl. Maybe push either 27 or 19 to play with Strome too. They've got some options outside of 97/29 all the time.
9509 2018-01-08 00:33:37 Trees and such still exist so presumably there's a non-car ecosystem that works much like ours and has plankton to form oil from.
9510 2018-01-08 00:33:37 Na Barca would not have sold Neymar if it was in their own hands. They have turned down massive bids from oil rich clubs for Messi over the years. They do everything to keep their stars.

9512 2018-01-08 00:33:30 Hello Mr. Graham. I'm going to ask you this once. Did you accept $800,000 in 2016 from a certain Russian oil oligarch who has dual citizenship?? Yes or No..don't deflect, yes or no. I already know the answer. A simple yes or no. Right here , on socila media.  The truth.Yes or No?
9513 2018-01-08 00:33:30 I've prepared a family-style lime cream pie with truffle oil, maple, and chipotle.
9514 2018-01-08 00:33:30 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
9515 2018-01-08 00:33:30 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9520 2018-01-08 00:33:09 10/10 would use coconut oil to make stove top popcorn again. All the kernels popped, all so light a airy. Reminds me of movie popcorn.
9521 2018-01-08 00:33:07 Oil management needs to address the media and fans, with out singling out players admit that they made mistakes. Give the coach a vote of confidence, tell them we are bringing in another special teams coach, whatever, just acknowledge to the fans we suck.

9527 2018-01-08 00:31:43 It’s beyond depressing.  How could so many Americans have been hoodwinked by these snake oil salesman?  It was so obvious they care about nothing but themselves

9530 2018-01-08 00:31:25 I guess these people don’t understand the meaning of “temporary” in TPS
9531 2018-01-08 00:31:25 The stock value of oil has been so low for the last few years, thousands lost their jobs, those of us still employed have been lucky to get by. Now, companies are ramping up exploration and production, I can work all the hours I want. That's $ in my pocket.
9532 2018-01-08 00:31:19 don't put any kind of oil on ur piercings!! it can prolong the healing process and irritate it needlessly. warm salt soak is best.

9544 2018-01-08 00:30:03 Who's going to make the oil companies absorb the cost? The tax is already being mandated. Where are the regulations enforcing the oil companies to absorb it? Why didn't you make sure they sucked it up before you endorsed the carbon tax? What did you think would happen?
9545 2018-01-08 00:30:01 I had only 1 but still i lost all my patterns all my gun parts all gun oil
9546 2018-01-08 00:30:00 Today, I was cleaning up the kitchen after a nice cozy dinner with my boyfriend at his parents' country house. I picked up the bottle of olive oil we'd used for cooking and spotted two dead mice in it. #FML
9547 2018-01-08 00:29:39 I wasn't proposing doing nothing. I am saying the 1st line didn't need to be tinkered with. If you make your decisions based solely on GF/GA, you'll be chasing your tail.

9549 2018-01-08 00:29:06 What “problem” are you referring to? It’s unclear what Alberta is failing at? Increases in jobs? Strong economy? What?

Or maybe you’re blaming us for the drop in oil? 

Do tell. What’s your beef?
9550 2018-01-08 00:29:06 Need to clean my room, wash my hair, and get an oil change on my car 
9551 2018-01-08 00:29:01 Mitt will be bad, but Stewart IS horrible for Utah. We love our public lands and he is selling them off to oil and gas just to line a few pockets
9552 2018-01-08 00:28:48 I rubbed coconut oil on my eyelids and now something’s happening  I have to stop believing that coconut oil is the key to everlasting life fr!
9553 2018-01-08 00:28:46 Double cleansing ini emang penting banget ya? Dan yang pertama harusnya oil ya? Aku pakai foam aja udah dibela2in banget nih

9561 2018-01-08 00:27:45 Hows your son please tell me the oil is working?
9562 2018-01-08 00:27:27 These lil Twitter recipes be literally salt, pepper, virgin oil (may include garlic sometimes)
9563 2018-01-08 00:27:25 Sorry to hear you are suffering. Vicks on your feet with socks on does work. Don’t ask me why, but it does. Head steams with tea tree oil also helps. Hope you will feel better soon 
9564 2018-01-08 00:27:25 Been quiet on twitter lately, partly because i'm busy af with Dadding,Husbanding & Work, but also because i've been going hard at Keto and apparently MCT oil means I spend most of my day in the bathroom one way or another.

Getting hecka jacked though.
9565 2018-01-08 00:27:19 My man just changed my oil and rotated my tires. #truelove
9566 2018-01-08 00:27:18 @CindyforSCHouse I very much want to but live in a land of oil, controlled by oil investors, crooks, racists, white nationalists, & Nazis. Soon as we kick their ass to the curb, I'll get back with you, so hold that thought.
9567 2018-01-08 00:27:17 There are engineering firms that build methane recapture technology for animal farms where the animals are housed indoors.  That methane can then be reused as fuel - lower C emissions than oil or coal.  Need more granularity for this to be anything more than clickbait
9568 2018-01-08 00:27:15 Iran being a threat is understood because North Korea has a stable relationship with Iran. Recently a Russia vessel was caught transferring oil to a North Korean vessel. With Russia conducting such operations and NK having ties to Iran, then Russia figures into the mix in Iran.
9569 2018-01-08 00:27:09 Yes, I don't know the recipe, but you either use a butter or oil extraction method which you add to the ingredients.
9570 2018-01-08 00:26:36 I’m sure there’s a nookie joke in there somewhere...
9571 2018-01-08 00:26:33 100% but to do nothing when you are getting your head repeatedly kicked in, isn't the answer.
9572 2018-01-08 00:26:32 You think that might have something to do with the fact it's more economically feasible to get oil out of the ground in the mid-east when oil prices are as low as they are? I'd say there's a very good chance of that.
9573 2018-01-08 00:26:31 Sadly it's very common, just Google or youtube jiffy lube problems. They destroyed my engine "trying" to repair damage they did. Their oil techs tried to act as mechanics, enough said.

9583 2018-01-08 00:25:09 Superior Tawny Oil required.
9584 2018-01-08 00:25:08 อ่าว ไปทำไร
9585 2018-01-08 00:25:04 They are just pancake batter. Equal parts flour and (soy/whatever) milk, bit of oil to replace the egg, salt. Pour into a hot muffin tray (1tsp of oil in each hole, heat until it sizzles) then in the oven until they look right or try to take over the oven.
9586 2018-01-08 00:25:01 Would it be okay for the @albertaNDP to take credit for oil hitting $60 a barrel? #UCP and all other forms of con-prattlers blamed them when it went down, shouldn't they get the upside when it goes back up? Just askin'
9587 2018-01-08 00:24:39 Just curious, what purpose would that exactly serve? Yes, it would give the media another angle to run with but it would help this group in no way.
9588 2018-01-08 00:24:27 I think avocado oil works best for my skin, but almond oil smells better.

•Se incrementan los gastos de construcción.
•Más perforaciones en altamar. La FED sugiere que seguirá aumentando las tasas.
•El desempleo en EEUU se mantuvo en 4,1%.
•Menos inventarios de crudo y riesgo geopolítico suben precios del oil
9591 2018-01-08 00:24:19 La confusión es real! Yo me salvo porque mis ojos se cegaron cuando leí que era mate y oil free (cosas de granudas).
9592 2018-01-08 00:24:17 & he shld put up *lots*, no TONS, of wind turbines ... maybe a couple oil rigs right off Mar-a-Lago! 
9593 2018-01-08 00:24:09 So even the oil companies themselves have sold out. Only Ezra Irrelevant and Lorrie are still pure.
9594 2018-01-08 00:24:01 GOP is not a friend to middle class only billionaires who donate to your re-election. Hope to see a sea of blue sweep you all out to sea and the oil rigs.
9595 2018-01-08 00:23:57 Yeah!!! Fucking drill it!! Stop our dependence on foreign oil!!
9596 2018-01-08 00:23:56 I just remembered that the black oil is called Purity, also the Nazi stuff in Triangle, also the other Nazi stuff in Field Where I Died, also... basically I am now spending my Monday morning skeeved out.
9597 2018-01-08 00:23:43 30mil cash, memorial for donkey Kong, killed(for protesting) Palestine ppl....arms, oil, and I'm sure other assets like a trump hotel and golf course. Yup, looking like it could reach billions now.

He also gave McConnell $2.5M, Rubio $1.5M, Scott Walker $1.1M, Kasich $250K & McCain $200K - we understand why when most of them weren't even running for elections took $
9607 2018-01-08 00:21:44 Royal Dutch Shell overstated reserves which is how they ended up buying Shell Canada Ltd. to begin with - to repair their misinformation by acquiring oil sands reserves.
9608 2018-01-08 00:21:36 The best bet is to stick with what gives you run of play. Pretty hard to reasonably expect more goals from fewer chances and less possession.

9610 2018-01-08 00:21:19 They are cowards and liars. They claim it’s an “ internal matter “ wasn’t Apartheid in South Africa an “ internal matter “ ??? But South Africa is not an oil rich country run by corrupt #thieveing #mullahs #internalmatter
9611 2018-01-08 00:21:13 I love putting baby oil on me after i shower
9612 2018-01-08 00:21:13 ...former Prez Bush said the IS would get half its oil from Africa in near future (when he was in office)... it's not publicized how much oil comes from Africa (the price paid is much less 2 cuz of "difficulty due to infrastructure"), besides all minerals for cell phones & tech

9622 2018-01-08 00:19:29 Oh, yeah. That’s why all this “patriots” rushed to buy real estate in NATO countries like crazy and move there families there as soon as they got oil money. So much for poor Yugoslavia.

9640 2018-01-08 00:17:17 Must remember to put engine oil in the car tomorrow.
9641 2018-01-08 00:17:09 With olive oil?
9642 2018-01-08 00:16:56 yes that's correct Britain had its oil piped through Palestine to Haifa port, Arabs entered, worked for Zionists & also attacking rioting to stop Jewish National Home so Britain denounced their original intent & barred Jewish immigration to pacify region's Arabs 4 oil business
9643 2018-01-08 00:16:51 Also ask yourself why a major oil producer would have the need for "nuclear power", the most likely answer is usually the correct answer
9644 2018-01-08 00:16:23 I went to get my oil changed in November and asked them to look it over and see if it needed winterizing
9645 2018-01-08 00:16:04 no oil?
9646 2018-01-08 00:16:00 i’m looking into getting an essential oil diffuser if anybody has an recommendations please let me know!!!
9647 2018-01-08 00:15:54 It’s truly incredible what water, no make up, and coconut oil 2 times a day can do to your skin 
9648 2018-01-08 00:15:42 BATH TIP! take a bath with 15-20 drops of essential oil (my favorite is sweet orange, add dried flower petals if you’re feelin frisky) when you get out you’ll not only be smelling like a delicious piece of candy, but your skin will be softer than egyptian silk
9649 2018-01-08 00:15:42 I use a Superdrug brand argon oil as a leave in conditioner on wet hair. It's light, shouldn't damage colour, leaping bunny approved and cheap as chips 
9650 2018-01-08 00:15:37 Might be a UTI. One of mine was peeing on my bed and I got special litter to test it and then gave her apple cider vinegar mixed with wet food and some coconut oil mixed in wet food.
9651 2018-01-08 00:15:37 That's really messed up...thanks for the info, it really emphasizes my point that this mass of refugees worldwide is causing all sorts of racism but ppl should be angry at corporations & governments who've wrecked these nation's economies & encouraged conflict for cheap oil etc
9652 2018-01-08 00:15:34 Oversimplification of complex medical conditions and their treatments is a hallmark of quackery. The 'root cause' of xyz always seems to be cured/prevented by whatever snake oil they happen to be selling via pills, powders, pkgd foods, carb-demonizing cookbooks, diet plans, etc!
9653 2018-01-08 00:14:59 My husband will never give up the oil. My friend uses & loves her.
9654 2018-01-08 00:14:58 i literally been rollin in oil and diesel.
9655 2018-01-08 00:14:52 And don’t forget spitfire oil that is in effect also a cash shell #Sro
9656 2018-01-08 00:14:52 So now it’s being transferred to a cargo ship?  Sure $60 Mil oil goes to South Korea. Rest of $100 Mil goes to North Korea.
9657 2018-01-08 00:14:51 Its always been my argument that to rely on top heavy economies of any strain is a bad thing , think industry dying , or services based industry locating in the modern generation from London to EU. Oil is no different.
9658 2018-01-08 00:14:33 Over 700 employees have left the EPA since Scott Pruitt took over. How concerned are you that expert EPA scientists are being replaced with oil and coal industry hacks?
9659 2018-01-08 00:14:30 Doesn't take much investigation to see the only reason @patagonia is under attack is because they oppose the govt takeover of our national parks so they can be raped and destroyed by the oil/gas industry. Sickening abuse of power! It's all abt the $$$$$$$$.

9672 2018-01-08 00:13:05 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
9673 2018-01-08 00:12:57 It's not any sort of cryptocurrency. It's an oil-backed digital version of the bolivar. And the oil backing isn't remotely credible, since most of Venezuela's oil is pledged to the Chinese.

9683 2018-01-08 00:11:31 @Simpson_Rick if i get the thc oil 90% should i not give her both oils? Big dose cbd oil in morning then afternoon & night high THC oil
9684 2018-01-08 00:11:16 you could be eating the wrong kind of truffle oil. lots of truffle oil is merely truffle infused oil and not technically made from truffles. it should cost at least $15+ per bottle for the real stuff
9685 2018-01-08 00:11:14 Competition where U have small chance of smelling trophy, wet U came to d party with boys. Wenger hoarding players like oil marketer!
9686 2018-01-08 00:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: burning crust with damp coconut oil and spinach.
9687 2018-01-08 00:10:54 Really Cindy? You need #oil for petroleum jelly.

9689 2018-01-08 00:10:34 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
9690 2018-01-08 00:10:33 This along with #DontheCon opening all US coastal waters for oil & gas exploration! Taxpayers will be completely footing the bill then for any oil spill clean up.
9691 2018-01-08 00:10:31 Wonder what the Marines think about oil drill off the coast of Oceanside.
9692 2018-01-08 00:10:27 Not only roll-backed protections & safety requirements but also Oil co,s are not financially liable for spills
9693 2018-01-08 00:10:22 CBD oil is not illegal and doesn't get you high... and is slowing starting to appear in cape shops..even Holland & Barrett's sell it
9694 2018-01-08 00:10:20 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
9695 2018-01-08 00:10:05 I pray my future husband is okay with cuddling, an essential oil diffuser and  a ocean sound machine playing while we fall asleep every night ....if not guess we have to sleep in different rooms
9696 2018-01-08 00:10:02 This is a DUMB article by someone who does NOT understand petroleum markets. Or do they?  Lowering the price of oil will hurt the other "90% of (countries with) proven global reserves" as well.   So the idea is to destroy the oil market in order to hurt Iran?  Who else?
9697 2018-01-08 00:09:59 Atlantic offshore drilling if legalized under the new proposal would take 10-15 years to begin producing oil for the US. We're supposed to end global fossil fuel use in 8 years if we hope to hold temperature rise to 1.3 C.
9698 2018-01-08 00:09:57 I don’t buy that sorry. Spices, canned goods, oil, vinegar etc have very long shelf lives stored properly. One person in my complex orders from this service and fills an entire curb size blue bin with cardboard each week.
9699 2018-01-08 00:09:45 If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me what I’m mixed with, and two dollars for every time I heard a white girl talk about her “anxiety,” I’d move to the Middle East to live amongst the rich oil A-rabs.
9700 2018-01-08 00:09:38 すぐ目を擦ろうとするから危ない
9701 2018-01-08 00:09:28 What happened to Al Gore since it got cold? He said seas will rise, then bought a Montecito beach house. He didn't believe what he promoted. Sold his network to Qatar (state oil money) it was all about money 4 him. Not principle. Global warming is climate change because it's cold
9702 2018-01-08 00:09:19 Truly an Icon.
9703 2018-01-08 00:09:15 Remove Crude Oil from Nigeria and reboot the Country
9704 2018-01-08 00:08:55 Sure Poison Ivy CLAIMS to be green. But do you know how much oil it takes to mutate just one giant flytrap?
9705 2018-01-08 00:08:53 Truffles = delicious
Truffle oil = 
9706 2018-01-08 00:08:46 They use oil to make the refined products that are necessary for the functioning of our economy. Given the necessity of the refined products to our functioning economy it seems like a reasonable way to get it done as oil is energy dense and is there anyways
9707 2018-01-08 00:08:35 Stop drinking the kool-aid, get educated not indoctrinated.  Oil isn’t going anywhere, anytime soon, try to make a windmill without it or a solar panel.
9708 2018-01-08 00:08:29 But in my experience, most are the same. As long as “refined organic coconut oil” is the only thing on the label, you should be fine. Criso’s is fragrance free which I prefer
9709 2018-01-08 00:08:29 Make a mixture of olive oil and lemon juice and then rub it on
9710 2018-01-08 00:08:25 I’ll do a hot oil treatment next Sunday
9711 2018-01-08 00:08:14 I find the sesame oil gives it a hint of smokiness
9712 2018-01-08 00:08:11 Start by getting Saudi Arabia to break from Russia and OPEC and up oil production and exports.
9713 2018-01-08 00:07:57 You know how oil and water just don't mix?  Exactly. They don't mix. Keep wells out of the water.
9714 2018-01-08 00:07:57 YouTube CBD oil & anxiety.
9715 2018-01-08 00:07:51 Nah.

You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here....
9716 2018-01-08 00:07:50 Westminster has had around 40 years of Scots Oil, or even if you call it UK oil, its still spunked it on enrichment of the few, and the socialists wanted the same theft for the many.

2032 means NO MORE NEW PETROL OR DIESEL CARS to be sold in Scotland , with similar timeframe EU.
9717 2018-01-08 00:07:18 *drenches life in lavender essential oil*
9718 2018-01-08 00:07:08 Coconut oil
9719 2018-01-08 00:07:05 aidan just put soy sauce in his oil diffuser
9720 2018-01-08 00:07:04 Leaving room for at least one to be called "Oil Can"
9721 2018-01-08 00:06:55 In other words; Starbucks nor Expedia is not accepting gold not oil for coffee, so I was surprised to see they do accept Crypto coins for their products and services.
9722 2018-01-08 00:06:33 add oil，Jane
9723 2018-01-08 00:06:19 Crisco has a great coconut oil
9724 2018-01-08 00:06:18 So I’m starting to think Tee tree oil is too harsh for my skin
9725 2018-01-08 00:06:15 You’d rather you buy oil from your uncles in the  middle east?
9726 2018-01-08 00:06:06 Called a Coup ?  Oil!  Siberia/Alaska - White Skin?  When we Rise (after mueller is fired)
He will call Marshall Law on Angry Rioting Lib Tards!?  Roy can lead the Army Of Angry White Men!?
9727 2018-01-08 00:05:59 There something about the name of Jesus! And there was something about seeing @BreFree pour out that oil and that water that shot up through my spirit!!! Glory be to God! #EchoatNoon is #SOFCC
9728 2018-01-08 00:05:38 Have you fixed the oil issues or still telling people after they buy the lemons that’s it’s a known issue that VW cars use more oil, or that it can take over 10 weeks to fix cars sell cars that are not of merchandisable quality and refuse to refund @volkswagen #Volkswagenlemons
9729 2018-01-08 00:05:24 Might as well do this hot oil treatment since I’m not doing anything else.
9730 2018-01-08 00:05:06 @JasonGregor 
Do you think a coaching change, a GM firing, or nothing is in the future for the Oil? I don't see a substantial trade coming now. Thoughts?
9731 2018-01-08 00:05:05 Who Got The Oil
9732 2018-01-08 00:05:05 Once I've put my lavender oil in my diffuser, turned on my salt lamp, and laid in my bed, my day is officially over and I can't be bothered.
9733 2018-01-08 00:05:05 Akhir mg lalu Dow naik +220,74 (+0,88%) di 25.295. S&P500 naik +19,16 poin (+0,70%) di 2.743. Oil di 61,53 dan Emas di 1319
9734 2018-01-08 00:04:48 Thought for sure that was going to be under review longer...he didn’t tuck the ball into bed, read it exactly 10 minutes worth of a bed time story, rub it down with organic baby oil followed by a tribal camp fire dance. But anyway, nice “catch” Greg Olsen.
9735 2018-01-08 00:04:28 Now do dependence on foreign oil by America hating friends of your folks...
9736 2018-01-08 00:04:18 I just started using face stuff at all but I have an oil free gel moisturizer from kiehl's. it's more expensive but it's very nice
9737 2018-01-08 00:04:13 3 past 12 and still no sign of sleep. Someone's just told me to put lavender oil on my feet! Are they shitting me
9738 2018-01-08 00:03:56 Oil field starting to boom again. So will my bank account. Hopefully go back to hitting the books again. 
9739 2018-01-08 00:03:49 @LindseyGrahamSC  I just watched you on MTP &you talked about conflict of interest!!Have you been in the white house? Oil giants,wallsreet people , climate deniers etc. making decisions that stuffin their pockets,you look the other way! ESPECIALLY POTUS! SHAME ON YOU!!
9740 2018-01-08 00:03:48 Pure palm oil is red gold...
9741 2018-01-08 00:03:46 Funny the oil industry gave my immigrant father a job for over 35 years
9742 2018-01-08 00:03:37 Discover oil under Barton Springs and I'm there
9743 2018-01-08 00:03:33 kabsat, please don't stop burning the midnight oil. 
9744 2018-01-08 00:03:31 I have noticed some products have started noting sustainably sourced palm oil on labels tho! That’s a win!
9745 2018-01-08 00:03:26 I’m long over due for an olive oil bath.
9746 2018-01-08 00:03:24 To add some flavor to your greens, sauté spinach and kale in olive oil &amp; fresh squeezed orange &amp; lemon juice. Serve with berries &amp; chicken.
9747 2018-01-08 00:03:23 Now turns out the whitepaper was plagiarized like hell too....

"Truth is like oil , always comes to the surface."

9753 2018-01-08 00:02:25 Opinions I can raise an eyebrow at.

It's when people bring beliefs that it is time for the oil and torches.
9754 2018-01-08 00:02:22 Oil is a bad idea, don't you think?
9755 2018-01-08 00:02:18 @smartdissent @dino_grandoni @eilperin 
Yes I knew that,was so shocked. When there is a spill oil co.s have no responsibility.
9756 2018-01-08 00:02:14 so ??? that’s like saying baby oil is made from babies bc “baby” is in the name

9763 2018-01-08 00:00:56 Yes, yes, good stuff. So, the Oil can not afford to keep Nuge passed this year is that correct?
9764 2018-01-08 00:00:55 Trust me, the oil companies have let me live very very well. #oilsandsproud 
9765 2018-01-08 00:00:54 Lavender/Peppermint oil!!!

9768 2018-01-08 00:00:51 The GOP wants the American people to clean up after the oil companies' messes, just like we will have to clean up this tax bill mess after voting Trump and his unthinking adherents out of power.
