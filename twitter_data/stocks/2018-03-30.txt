80 2018-04-01 22:43:20 Where in the constitution are bump stocks protected?
81 2018-04-01 22:41:31 you also need those 2 stocks to make use of defensive counter switch(burst basically) that depletes all meter and puts you on pretty high cooldown
82 2018-04-01 22:40:29 adding off of followup tweets: there's meter that's 2 stocks.

calling assist depletes 1 stock and has a short cooldown

you can call assist then have them stay out for longer depending on how much assist meter you have (2 stocks is longer basically)

119 2018-04-01 21:55:42 Technically, one round is fired for each pull of the trigger, so they skirt the law.  However, I believe they should be banned because it makes no sense to ban automatic weapons but then allow these bump stocks.
120 2018-04-01 21:54:30 Trump, Republicans, NRA  watch our American heroes who were gunned down by a shooter in a hotel room using a bump stock.

125 2018-04-01 21:45:58 I'm no expert but: fishing is 0.5% of GDP,  we can't overfish even w/out fishing policies (stocks dwindle until nothing left) and, this is the big problem, our biggest market for catch is the EU. 

But I sympathise with fishing communities, successive govts pushed them to brink.

146 2018-04-01 21:23:16 Mark Zuckerberg should be placed in stocks and made to have little children laugh and point at him for 12 hours at a time
147 2018-04-01 21:20:51 Somenodys stocks go out of roof
148 2018-04-01 21:18:39 I did point & figure plots of about 500 stocks per day from 1979 to about 1993.  I finally cleaned them out of my basement last year.
149 2018-04-01 21:18:11 I've lost money on stocks, lost belongings (including my wallet) and valuables and some chances to make extra cash throughout the years, but nothing bothers me or terrifies me more than the chance of being banned and losing my membership to moviepass. Que?
150 2018-04-01 21:17:50 XRP is a good investment long term, you should wait for further bottoming so I’m not touching it for now, last time it throttled to 20k it went back below 1k - be patient on that though. For now, I’m like a pink stocks man!!! That’s where my returns are.
151 2018-04-01 21:15:40 "Bump stocks don't kill people." "Someone knew and they did nothing."
152 2018-04-01 21:15:36 High return technology stocks. All run by founders.
153 2018-04-01 21:14:32 You are misinformed. The only thing Hughes amendment did was prohibit the sale of FA firearms manufactured after ‘86 making them onerously more expensive by limiting supply. And bump stocks, approved by the obama ATF simulates FA. Big difference.
154 2018-04-01 21:11:16 So, for example: bump stocks for everyone (including the children!)?  And criminal background checks for no one?
155 2018-04-01 21:10:00 Last week was the 10th week in a row that S&P Futures had posted a weekly trading range of more than 2.2%. This sequence has extended to 11 weeks only once in the 295 weeks since 3 August 2012, the exception coming on 18 March 2016, 107 weeks ago #stocks
156 2018-04-01 21:08:49 Background checks, 3 day waiting period, ban on the sale of assault rifles and bump stocks, Ban on sales of weapons to domestic violence abusers.
157 2018-04-01 21:08:47 Now I did watch a little last week and to be fair @AdamHenson he released one of his stocks heads from the stall brave man as could have gone wrong #authentic well I hope so either that or they did a number of takes!!!

161 2018-04-01 21:04:11 Yes, but $BYOC is not a caveat emptor like $FRFS is, I'm sure FINRA/SEC will be taking that into account, but I'll be watching to see how FRFS rolls out. 

Been watching OTC stocks for a few years, but this last year in some OTCs, is curiously interesting, learned a lot so far.

169 2018-04-01 20:56:13 4 stocks I’ve never heard off.what about these two $aldr $amrs. There not for everyone... just for people who want to be richer then they are now.
170 2018-04-01 20:55:26 Bump stocks are still legal.
171 2018-04-01 20:53:58 Worse still...it's just a bogus argument...why don't you point fingers at the selectors? Trust me...I've got a feeling that Fifita would actually be in  the top 4 forwards for SOO this year. NSW's stocks are pretty thin & McLean is out.

176 2018-04-01 20:50:40 @Stocks_68 Did you get your wee lucky angel last night?? I asked @Heeels to pass it on to you 
177 2018-04-01 20:49:41 Idiot.  The short term price swings have zero to do with the fundamental impact BTC has on the global payment systems.  Go back to making predications in the archaic industries like publicly-traded stocks and bonds.
178 2018-04-01 20:46:58 Proposed census question: List the guns in your house, whether they are fitted with bump stocks, and their magazine capacity.
179 2018-04-01 20:46:57 Probably nothing to do with it. I gave @Heeels and @Stocks_68 a lucky angel each last night. Well if Liam remembered to give it to Shayne 
180 2018-04-01 20:45:47 Sensible gun laws like a ban on AR-15's and other military style weapons, background checks and closing the gun show loophole, ban on bump stocks and raising the legal age to buy a gun.
181 2018-04-01 20:43:49 @Ellislee1212 @stocks_william
182 2018-04-01 20:43:32 Agreed. I'm simply pointing out that the only reason these stocks were grouped together as FANG was because of their momentum (from a trading perspective) and their PE ratio. Had nothing to do with tech relevance only "tech sector."

184 2018-04-01 20:40:17 Agree many views not logical. Central banks accelerated asset gains at the expense of kids so school tax is logical. FYI stocks pay corp tax

186 2018-04-01 20:39:09 Yes. Somewhat similar but less mainstream. There were over 900 mostly tech IPOs in ‘99 and ‘00.  Imagine more than 1 VC-backed tech IPO every day for 2 years. Then many millions of people post-IPO had stock portfolios full of inflated tech stocks.

209 2018-04-01 20:21:57 On my 7th cup of coffee today
210 2018-04-01 20:21:42 I agree mental health must be addressed, for more reasons than just mass shootings.  But we can take multiple approaches to solve a problem.  I’d consider protecting schools, banning bump stocks, universal background checks, and raising the minimum age for gun purchases.
211 2018-04-01 20:21:18 I don't follow this clay trader but did check him out after your tweets  or sure how you know this info on him but I am the kids guy that steers clear and would rather learn from proven leaders
212 2018-04-01 20:20:18 Watching Bitcoin charts these days reminds me  of JDS and Worldcom stocks that cost me a fortune back then. I am of the opinion most of the money that can be made from Bitcoin is already made; till, governments around the world figure out how to regulate it
213 2018-04-01 20:19:06 There's only five ways of making money that are personally acceptable to me.
1. Work for it.
2. Ask for it.
3. Invest your earned money in stocks.
4. Creat and sell a line of merchandise.
5. Win at gambling (I mostly do not gamble)

But you don’t, and you won’t, so let’s just point and laugh everyone.
221 2018-04-01 20:08:55 A democrat made bump stocks possible through legislation not a republican; do your homework.
222 2018-04-01 20:08:23 Yeah, that is a massive drop in price. Dead cat bounce. Will roll through at some point.

234 2018-04-01 20:00:02 No. They have been infringing all the time. It's one thing then it's another and then another. That doesn't mean I am for bump stocks etc. but it is still infringing.
235 2018-04-01 19:59:25 Interesting to see what their stocks look like.

241 2018-04-01 19:54:25 Banning Bump Stocks and large capacity magazines, certain semi-auto firearms, limiting ammo ownership, will not satisfy the Liberal Left Democrap agenda.
If they can't get the 2nd Amendment repealed, they will limit it's effectiveness thru GRADUAL REGULATION.

245 2018-04-01 19:49:20 I'm sick and tired of hearing people crying and moaning about bump stocks likely being banned. If you're that bad of a shot, learn to shoot better. They bitch like guns are illegal when they're 100% legal. They have nothing to complain about. Regulation doesn't = criminalization.

249 2018-04-01 19:47:04 @RFGent1 hey jackass -
I don’t blame kids for not wanting to be shot. I blame you for the false narrative that Trump caused.
Who approved sales of bump stocks? Obama and he has Vegas blood on his hands. Check the number of mass shootings during his reign. It was ZERO.
250 2018-04-01 19:46:45 Our current stock situation.. Anything from Heineken, Molson Coors & AB INBEV is pretty poor, local breweries & 'craft' is good. Any stella folks that follow us, we're working with different suppliers to get our stocks up. Will know more details in the coming days
251 2018-04-01 19:46:44 You think creating a decentralized internet will happen in a month or two your delusional. This is a long term project. I don't think you have the patience for crypto. Maybe you should move over to penny stocks.

253 2018-04-01 19:45:00 @BeruangSinar WTH do bump stocks have to do with this massacre? NOTHING!! Cruz didn’t use one. Y’all are so misinformed it’s unbelievable. It also wasn’t an assault rifle, semiautomatics are the same as most handguns. Hogg called NRA members murderers, no wonder we’re pissed.
254 2018-04-01 19:44:32 *and take this to heart - through the LIES, NRA never had anything to do with Bump Stocks. Zero, Nada, nothing, zip, zilch.
Obama ATF researched and Approved without any outside influence.
255 2018-04-01 19:43:50 Kind of. But coins and stocks are very different

258 2018-04-01 19:41:20 @margaretcox2299 appreciates you helping her out with this. We already have background checks and bump stocks (the ones that Obama made legal) are now banned. All semi-auto rifles will never be banned, keep dreaming there. So it seems like both sides will need to compromise
259 2018-04-01 19:41:17 And that draft is looking pretty stellar with both Boeser's and Gaudette's stocks rising high, having Brisebois playing well in the AHL, and Jasek's AHL debut.

273 2018-04-01 19:28:45 That’s my point. Assault rifles and Bump Stocks that turn Rifles into Automatic Assault Weapons should be Banned. Join the Military if you must.Hunting with Assault Weapons is cruel and inhumane. If you have more love for Weapons of War than the lives of Children, you need help.

276 2018-04-01 19:27:18 Good thing I don't deal with stocks, cause, Lord knows, everyone I've invested in left me broke - mentally, physically, and spiritually.
277 2018-04-01 19:25:30 These people aren't thinking. Stocks are going to bottom out, and tens of thousands of jobs will be lost. Sounds like a great idea!
278 2018-04-01 19:24:54 No shit the stock market has flat lined and stocks tanked no-one wants to invest in canada people have lost billions b/c of Trudope

281 2018-04-01 19:22:40 It’s not the LEAST of my worries. It all adds up! Too many easy and stupid ways we allow criminals and domestic abusers and mentally ill get weapons. Why not just hand out bump stocks too! Let’s have a raffle!!
282 2018-04-01 19:20:32 @RussMoyer @RBirzi @C_Schaber @Josh_Scoon @jjorgensen15 @nucci39 @Stocks_68 absolutely fantastic. Just go for it in Nottingham #flyersaregoingtotheplayoffs
283 2018-04-01 19:18:57 However, #commodity #trading is a battle between return and risk. Because of the leverage involved, you can achieve a higher rate of return than from most other forms of #investment, but at a higher risk. Commodities trade on different #markets than typical #stocks.
284 2018-04-01 19:18:46 curtain stocks while collapsing others. Cancer is a fact of life . devote you're resources to the cures.
285 2018-04-01 19:16:25 Yup. AND above all, it is silly. Makes one think that "those stocks that must be owned" have further room to roam on the downside.
286 2018-04-01 19:15:50 okay! 
- thorough background checks 
- ban of weapons made for military & not citizens (automatic rifles)
- ban of high capacity magazines & bump stocks 
- monitoring while owning the gun 
- age 21+ 
that way people can buy handguns for protection that can’t kill 17 ppl in 6 mins
287 2018-04-01 19:14:40 I love stuff like spaghetti harvest & flying penguins.

Anything hurtful, personal, shaming, nope. For that kind of stuff, I say Bring Back The Stocks

294 2018-04-01 19:07:06 Oh!!!! Yes you are correct I assume you are fmrefering to bump stocks.

303 2018-04-01 18:56:28 You see similar things this past week with tech stocks. They went up and down in similar percentages
304 2018-04-01 18:55:15 @mcuban if there were/are 5 stocks you own or would consider buying in the A.I. sector what would they be?
305 2018-04-01 18:54:42 Bump Stocks not necessary

309 2018-04-01 18:49:34 Where in the constitution did it mention bump stocks?
310 2018-04-01 18:49:10 I haven't seen significant gaps on bitcoins especially with the increased liquidity now.
But in the stocks a lot can go over the weekend and then Monday morning it messes you up completely.
Just imagine if bitcoin markets closed over the weekends.
311 2018-04-01 18:48:56 When gun stocks didn’t jump after Parkland, I knew next to nothing would be done. When the heavy hitter investors, chock full of insider info, don’t jump on that sector, the fix was in from the get. I’m sure Icahn called the WH and friendly congresspeople and got the skinny.
312 2018-04-01 18:48:02 It will be a victim of the roll over like all stocks that valuations that are ridiculously overpriced.
313 2018-04-01 18:47:54 final smash is being resurrected and getting his stocks back but it takes 3 days to activate so u gotta be careful using it
314 2018-04-01 18:46:38 Agreed!! Wallstreet is afraid because people moving to crypto rather than traditional stocks.
315 2018-04-01 18:39:43 This is one of the reasons why I prefer trading crypto over stocks. Stocks can also mess you up with these gaps.
Put options may help a bit, but comes with additional cost.
Much safer to manage risk in a 24x7 market.
316 2018-04-01 18:39:27 Obviously there can be a compromise. But it won't fix the problem: Gun violence.
Neither increased background checks, nor getting rid of loop holes, nor banning bump stocks and assault rifle will reduce gun violence in the US.
Because there will still be more guns than people.

319 2018-04-01 18:36:54 Actually, his ban on bump stocks is blatantly unconstitutional.
320 2018-04-01 18:36:48 My timing has been delayed. Stocks need to go UP before the next market cratering and stocks have been languishing... I expect upside as earnings season start in April.   But the next plunge after that should be historic in line with what you see for   summer
321 2018-04-01 18:36:17 I will take your suggestion seriousily. I have to go and dig up the old brokerage statements. Getting in was easy because there were only like 3-6 publicly traded stocks when the last bull market got started.
322 2018-04-01 18:35:57 Great. Shorted at 7K covered at 6,600
Shorting in a bear market is no different than putting stocks on a dart board in a bull market and throwing a dart and buying. No skills needed when stupid people are panic selling and running this down.

329 2018-04-01 18:31:33 should be a option to do both! 
330 2018-04-01 18:31:31 Except Trump supports banning bump stocks and raising the age of purchase to 21, doesn't sound like someone who protects the constitution

333 2018-04-01 18:31:03 Look at the patterns of the stocks going into the new year then until April when Trudeau came out and said they’re for sure legalizing - very similar
334 2018-04-01 18:30:18 Not sure when but if you look at the Canadian weed stocks my thoughts are that it will follow a similar pattern until the regulation recommendations come, in July like the g20 asked/when Russia regulates by July

I replied by saying it’s someone who knows nothing about stocks but randomly  picks one out of thin air, basically luck. One replied you’re one lucky so and so. Thankfully miserly I’ve found someone who understands

339 2018-04-01 18:23:23 Stocks are taking a dive due to the idiotic trade war that trump is starting.  Protectionist policies were a chief cause of the Great Depression.
340 2018-04-01 18:22:58 I’m with you! You and the kids who put together the March For Our Lives are on the right side of history here. I support gun REFORM (univ background checks, no bump stocks, red flag laws), not a complete ban on all guns. This is the lie the NRA tells to scare people.
341 2018-04-01 18:22:48 And THIS White House?? Who signed for the use of these bump stocks? Obama did.
342 2018-04-01 18:22:30 true that, excellent rear-view stocks -- but plenty cloudy looking forward.  no coincidence this mess comes along with rising real rates - an environment when all dreams come true!

344 2018-04-01 18:19:50 Bump Stocks can be made with a belt.  They were not the issue.  The Sheriff’s department was complicit, because had they done their job, Cruz would not have passed the background check.

349 2018-04-01 18:16:38 Me neither. His plan to ban bump stocks is dispicable. Even Hussain's administration said they were GTG. He needs to be much more rightwinged!
350 2018-04-01 18:15:44 And if I challenged that, you wouldn’t agree with that either. Bump Stocks use the recoil to make the gun fire more rapidly, although I’m sure you already know that.

352 2018-04-01 18:11:15 I’m pretty sure the kids who took bullets in their skulls & those close to them were closer to their shooter than you were to the guy on the 32nd floor of a hotel.
Good news: David & supporters got bump stocks banned in FL.
You should thank him.
353 2018-04-01 18:10:10 Stocks going up
354 2018-04-01 18:09:44 I understand that the banning of a category of weapons is very complicated. I get that. That’s why Bump stocks and high capacity magazines to be the focus.
355 2018-04-01 18:06:54 The second amendment must define “arms” not to include bump stocks, multiple mags ammunition, nor assault rifles which are outside its original intent.
356 2018-04-01 18:06:52 FB is based only on stocks and it's product is information. The moment it loses credibility (which it did), it loses.

I guess experiences help.
Since you mentioned 80% in few weeks means you are calculating from ATH, BTC loses 60%. I guess everything has their risks even the safest one 
359 2018-04-01 18:04:42 I live in Texas so spring here is short do I count have time for seed starting, instead I'm going to get plants that have already started, if u like veggies, onions are good since u can use their stocks for chives while they are growing, other veggies like peppers are good 2

363 2018-04-01 17:57:02 True. Market continues to seduce investors by offering upto 70% on beaten down stocks. Its actually a trap.
364 2018-04-01 17:54:29 Words are just words. They're not bullets, like the ones that tore through his friends' bodies because nobody acted on all of the warning signs that were reported re: this shooter. They're not bump stocks or high cap magazines. He's fucking pissed and fucking frustrated. ME TOO.
365 2018-04-01 17:53:05 My 23 year old daughter has one.  It was my great grandpa's, then my grandma's, now she carries the tradition and she stocks it with gum drops. The youth shpuld not be scared to be old and the old not be scared to be young.

368 2018-04-01 17:45:32 they didn’t have to sue every aspect of that law but they did - including bump stocks

i don’t agree that is the majority of what the nra does and therefore about & this is easily verifiable

429 2018-04-01 17:39:15 LOL well people have been doing technical analysis on stocks and charts for over a century, they're not going to stop anytime soon, better make peace with it.
430 2018-04-01 17:39:13 I've no 'dog in fight' on fishing, but it seems from outside there have been two issues
1) quotas to control stocks, which most have fought tooth and nail and abused; and not be overseen)
2) division if the quota.

There was an election with known rules called Constitution and guess who won?
The country is beginning to boom. Lowest nationwide unemployment, wage growth beginning etc etc.

439 2018-04-01 17:32:57 Stocks such as $CDNA $RCKT appear to be setting up for base breakouts.  The mkt is still sketchy, but if they can make a move and hold, then they might be worth a few shares.

442 2018-04-01 17:32:19 I’m getting tired of this. But black and white thinking is so prevalent. I want universal background checks (private sales too), universal red flag laws, universal waiting periods, and ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines. I want funded research. That’s it.

You're SO RIGHT about my "bike filth invest" stuff! People should be investing in stocks and bonds, not bike filth! I don't know what I was thinking!
503 2018-04-01 17:25:01 Going to be interesting to watch NBA draft stocks leading up to the draft.  Jevon Carter’s hustle, worth ethic, and ability on the defensive end is not only going to open the eyes of scouts, but other players. And move those players down people’s “big boards” and him up
504 2018-04-01 17:24:09 Both in cryptos if you are a position or swing trader. Arithmetic in all futures, forex and stock stocks if your time frame is less than 2 years.

510 2018-04-01 17:17:11 For trades GOAL is 2 stay in the right direction of the market 4 over 95% of times. If wrong get out quickly by self initiating a loss as you may have seen in futures trading or with STOPS in stocks trading.Believe down direction is best for now with trail stops to protect gains
511 2018-04-01 17:15:41 Don't want to take them,  just reasonable rules for ownership.   No high capacity magazines or bump stocks.  Plus,  why do you need more than one?
512 2018-04-01 17:15:28 Any high velocity semi-auto rifle is a no for me. Bump stocks are a no for me. High capacity magazines are a no for me.

How many anti-abortionists can correctly label all the parts of a human female’s reproductive system?
513 2018-04-01 17:14:52 Ban bump stocks.
514 2018-04-01 17:14:05 I assure you I am real I do exist. Just because I'm not online building my following all the time doesnt mean I don't exist. I'm working 70 hour weeks,buying stocks and cool tech stuff. I just do this to have fun cause most people are stupid and don't know how to logic.
515 2018-04-01 17:14:02 Any high velocity semi-auto rifle is a no for me. Bump stocks are a no for me. High capacity magazines are a no for me.

520 2018-04-01 17:12:04 On rent-seeking, just the new tax law is an enormous boon for stocks & the businesses which depend on them. I tell my foreign clients to incorporate in the US & ride the gravy train for domestic production. American & foreign firms will likely produce outside the US for rest.

607 2018-04-01 16:54:39 The amount of important blood stocks that they’re refusing that could save people’s lives  men having sex with men is no different to the risks of heterosexual couples having sex. The blood is screened!!

634 2018-04-01 16:31:30 Yup, it is more sad that few investors highlight this price action gauge of their other holdings to indicate the quality of those stocks and silently hide their underperformers  
635 2018-04-01 16:31:00 Then u have nothing to worry about if we ban bump stocks and semi-automatics in another law

700 2018-04-01 16:25:13 This happens in every market, the difference with crypto is relatively low liquidity and high volatility like penny stocks. That whales take full advantage of this both ways in a sideways/bear market is obvious.

711 2018-04-01 16:11:55 Yeah, this. If you ask for something "tasty" or "spicy" they'll just dump chilli powder in before they serve you. The germans can't cope with spice, so the chefs can't bake it into the base stocks from the start.

806 2018-04-01 15:39:49 Right, and those that held on to their stocks & shares through the downturn did really well on the recovery. But those who got scared watching a bear market sold off and ended up rekt. Happened to plenty of guys in the union I worked in.

821 2018-04-01 15:30:12 It’ll do whatever you want it to do. You can go back in time and purchase stocks and be a billionaire or take 70 mill and walk away 
822 2018-04-01 15:29:07 However, the ban on "Automatic Weapons" and "Bump-Stocks" I find acceptable, because THOSE are truly lethal and ARE weapons of war. I wish I could still fire Machine Guns and Grenade Launchers, but understand why not. I will make that sacrifice for society.
823 2018-04-01 15:28:55 I fully believe that if Vermont (a rural state with some of the most lenient gun laws in the country) can pass sweeping reform on background checks, bump stocks, and gun purchasing age.... there may be hope just yet.  I can’t wait to see what else gen z will do.

836 2018-04-01 15:19:06 Recently I tweeted that over a certain period (need to confirm how long) #US #Tech #stocks have returned 700%. But I also tweeted that we have a new #Tech-#Bubble. #Facebook just adjusted strongly. May be impacted more.

840 2018-04-01 15:14:37 Other things proposed that over 2/3rds of country favors: universal background checks, ban on bump stocks, ban semiauto rifles with grandfather laws, and buyback programs. It’s common sense not an assault on 2A.

844 2018-04-01 15:07:41 With the Amazon Tweets by Trump, Is he giving his friends any insider info first. Especially since he knows it will hit their stocks. Is there a way to investigate that possibility? It is a Fed Crime to give insider info and receive it. @CNN
845 2018-04-01 15:05:54 sorry fingers faster than my brain apparently lol I am talking about his tweets on Amazon this time. Is he giving his friend's insider info that he is going to tweet about them in a negative way to hit their stocks? Then their friends go and sell before the tweet comes out.
846 2018-04-01 15:04:11 I am also wondering who Trump talks to before he tweets out things like he did on Twitter. Did he give those people any insider info that he was going to do this which would hit their stocks? Is he giving his friend's insider information which would be a Federal Crime?
847 2018-04-01 15:04:02 To be fair, isn’t part of it from the other side boycotting because of Amazon’s ties to the nra? (I know nothing about business and less about stocks, so I accept that I probably have no clue what I’m talking about.)

849 2018-04-01 15:02:51 Two rubs here, Commonly used for lawful purposes isn't part of 2a, and commonly is subjective. Looks pretty common on the bump stocks production floor.

853 2018-04-01 15:00:38 Yeah I agree and I don't think bump stocks is a problem it's just an excuse to infringe on our rights and let's criminals have the upper hand regulation against the Second Amendment is unconstitutional period.
854 2018-04-01 15:00:33 It's a lagging indicator. It's telling us we have been in a downward trend. Often times, even in traditional stocks it signifies the end or close to before a period of accumulation occurs. But you are right, in crypto it's worthless. Ripple had a golden cross at the top.
855 2018-04-01 15:00:02 Good grief! You people act like the bump stock just appeared out of thin air! It was invented, just as guns, knives, cars, and cell phones. Making bump stocks illegal doesn't change anything.
856 2018-04-01 14:58:41 Of course, and the bump stocks too.

862 2018-04-01 14:50:44 See, again a false statements. There has not been a bump stock used. That too is something that is being attack. I personally don’t think bump stocks should be available. But for you to use is in the same sentence as this incident makes you a liar.
863 2018-04-01 14:50:34 I want universal background checks, waiting periods, red flag laws, better mental health care and coverage, sandy hook parents program to identify at risk kids, ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines. I’m ok with those being available at shooting ranges for enthusiasts.
864 2018-04-01 14:47:33 @POTUS I'm probably your #1 fan. I defend you on everything, but you are making that pretty difficult lately with your lack of leadership on our 2A rights... Your supporters are starting to turn. You need to let Congress deal with bump stocks and stand with the NRA. Don't give in

873 2018-04-01 14:38:05 Well it doesn’t surprise me that someone of his character who has proven not to be trustworthy would renege on his promise to not just ban bump stocks but also strengthen background checks!

875 2018-04-01 14:36:28 Not all guns would be taken away just the powerful automatic ones along with bump stocks and more.

911 2018-04-01 13:51:28 Imagine bump stocks, ARs and “assault weapons” get banned...another mass shooting happens...what rights do they go after next?
912 2018-04-01 13:51:16 Representative @VoteRandyFine who voted for legislation you take credit here in FL just introduced a new legislation undercutting it. He wants to allow bump stocks and not have minimal age of 21 to buy certain guns. Have you tweeted your outraged Kyle? Or contacted his office?

917 2018-04-01 13:46:07 Bearish $TSLA now at $266. We have been bearish on $TSLA since last year when we first recommended that traders sell at $300 and target $286 (see post of 03/10/2017). #stocks #markets #trading

I think this would be a good start ;) who can disagree..

949 2018-04-01 13:16:23 My stance on the stocks has always been they need volumes and pricing to both meet consensus. If either disappoint stocks are going lower. Undersupply on day 1 doesn't necessarily equal higher stock prices. All depends on what is priced in.

951 2018-04-01 13:12:13 Another good place to look - Stocks which get punished disproportionately because of market sentiment only as ther fundamentals remain intact.
In every correction some stocks bottom out as well. Whenever the market recovers few stocks will fly from their lows.

961 2018-04-01 12:59:37 Background checks. No guns sold (none) to people with mental health issues. No bump stocks. There are sensible steps we can take. This all or nothing is not working.
962 2018-04-01 12:58:43 Fed govt Did not criminalize the sale of bumpstocks.  They are examining an ATF regulatory rule.  But my criminalizing them.  Big difference.  Ask yourself why NRA is against legislative action on bump stocks.  Why?

984 2018-04-01 12:35:53 Some may know $TSLA is a zero but be invested anyway because during a bubble, being in “popular” stocks helps you fundraise. Likely same goes for most of these “cryptocurrency hedge funds”. The temptation to raise money to facilitate others to ride a bubble is too great.

1021 2018-04-01 11:36:32 The problem with stocks is they are inherently a totally massively noisey and complex system. And today it's hard to tell even what the mixture of participants and decisions are (hedge funds, mutual funds, quants, hft, etc etc) 

So drawing causality and half knowledge r killers
1022 2018-04-01 11:36:27 No common sense. Recall the near annihilation of birds of prey through the late 19th century into a good part of the 20th. Birds of prey help the game stocks to become more vigorous, survival of the fittest. With out the Hare, the habitat becomes degraded and all suffer. THINK!
1023 2018-04-01 11:34:01 True, good points.  But.  Perhaps "stock" means invested interest?  Public enthusiasm?  Additionally, we know that traditional Wall Street stocks in parallel companies (Tesla) rise and fall with SpaceX news..

1041 2018-04-01 11:13:07 Fact so many ppl could've done & still could get better returns from a Stocks & Shares ISA is no joke. Think many avoid them as name suggests they're high risk but that depends how they're invested. Cash ISAs are also less effective now we have a PSA. P.S. Happy Easter!

1089 2018-04-01 10:06:42 Imo dividends aren’t as important as asset price stability, meaning price of stock. If oil the commodity tanks these will tank more than regular stocks that pay small dividends
1090 2018-04-01 10:01:23 If they outlawed the AR-15, bump stocks and other machine guns, would there be fewer school shootings? Probably not. But fewer people would die.

1092 2018-04-01 09:54:44 According to the OPCW who oversaw the process, they have destroyed all their stocks as of 2017, marking full compliance. The US and UK are yet meet their obligations and destroy all stockpiles. Shoot and a miss there fella.

1107 2018-04-01 09:25:39 .@SteveScalise Well there is that "death by a 1000 cuts" thing. Ban a type ammo here ban a bump stock there. Bump stocks are a trinket if left alone but banning them makes them one of the cuts that lead to tyranny.

1114 2018-04-01 09:11:54 Well, ban bump stocks, for one. There's broad support for that. And I think we need to take a hard look at assault weapons and enhance background checks.
1115 2018-04-01 09:09:59 Similar example I had was a potential client who baulked at NPI exit penalties and went away with existing pension in tact.

1119 2018-04-01 09:03:10 Then @russellEstes84 you agree with the perspective of the Parkland Shooter survivors. They just want comprehensive background checks, a ban on bump stocks (which increase rate of fire almost to automatic rate - 88 rpm), ban on large capacity magazines & a ban on assault weapons.

1122 2018-04-01 08:56:22 Broad market ETFs include rewarded risks and unrewarded risks. Also can have extreme concentration to a few (volatile) stocks. ABSA's new ETFs try to give you only rewarded risks and reduce concentration risk. Will tweet interesting graphs on Tuesday.

1150 2018-04-01 08:04:18 Rising rates mean (at a minimum) a higher discounting of future expected cash-flows from companies revenue. This is a drag on stocks. As Warren Buffet says 'Interest rates are like gravity on stocks' - smart man.

1287 2018-04-01 04:16:47 What stocks is good to buy ..
1288 2018-04-01 04:16:25 Raising the age to own a gun to 21 is arbitrary and has no basis to exist.

The NRA supports regulated bump stocks.

AR-15 shoots varmint rounds and is not especially powerful, and has been used to stop shootings.

NRA members have never been mass shooters.

1292 2018-04-01 04:13:57 Hmmm. I have guns & support common sense gun control, background cks, no bump stocks, etc. Some ppl want 0 guns. Difficult to do bc if they go beyond common sense, I we fight back.

1295 2018-04-01 04:06:05 I hear you. I'm not fond of equating people to wool either. But the economic logic holds. Buffer stocks stabilize commodity prices. U.S runs various /AUS dropped the ball/. So we keep some commodities "fully employed" through price support schemes, but we don't do it for labor?!

Hundreds of protesters gathered to urge Repub. Gov. Phil Scott not to sign a new bill that would ban high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, expand background checks for private gun sales and raise the legal age for gun purchases

huh? why?

1313 2018-04-01 03:29:46 Never ceases to amaze me, that specific stock bulls always find a "new" method of valuation or reasons why suddenly the old ones dont apply to their favourite. But they are applicable to everybody else's stocks.

1318 2018-04-01 03:24:45 My city banned bump stocks...it's a start...
1319 2018-04-01 03:24:31 I have no problem with bump stocks but I also don't care if they're banned because I understand how they work.
1320 2018-04-01 03:23:17 Horrible pure stocks put on best race
1321 2018-04-01 03:22:54 If we give on the bump stocks then you will want the rest of it. And what makes you think that more laws are the answer? It is already against the law to murder, or rape, or assault! But yet it still happens.
1322 2018-04-01 03:22:00 Also bump stocks have been around forever and have been used in exactly one mass shooting. The Vegas shooter could've done a lot more damage if he actually aimed his shots, bump stocks make the gun horribly inaccurate and prone to jamming.
1323 2018-04-01 03:09:51 Bankruptcy. Stocks go bye bye.
1324 2018-04-01 03:08:35 Never said that! I think it’s sad our youth can serve in the military and die for this country before they can even buy a beer...alcohol does kill more people a year then guns! Do you support Trump banning Bump Stocks and making background checks stricter?

1329 2018-04-01 03:04:55 already have UBC which also register the gun (and yes, it's computerized), bump stocks are already banned as of a couple weeks ago, mag size doesn't matter because it takes 1 second to switch mags, 'military grade' weapons are already banned for civilian ownership. Next?

1340 2018-04-01 02:51:45 How is banning assault rifles and bump stocks taking away your freedom?
1341 2018-04-01 02:50:53 4).... those decisions for the greater good. No one is advocating taking your guns. We're advocating common sense measures, banning bump stocks, high velocity, high capacity rounds, etc. No civilian needs assault weapons for any reason. Children that are shot with high velocity

1344 2018-04-01 02:48:42 I'd like to add I'm not exactly a fan of bump stocks. I have fired with one but don't own one. They're really kind of a gimmick for those too inept to learn how to fire fast without it. I can get the same effect with a string or my belt loop.
1345 2018-04-01 02:48:09 Finally got my vision issues sorted out. Guess it's time to start buying stocks in contact manufacturers. Wonder if I can get mini-displays built-in.

1347 2018-04-01 02:44:49 You can use bump stocks, modify them etc. you don’t have the same issue with a pistol. Accuracy and the chances of easy mass casualties would go down. Why do you have a gun fetish? You just don’t need an assault weapon and have no excuse other than no one has told you otherwise

1355 2018-04-01 02:37:07 @trapqueentrader Hi Bri! I wanted to ask you a question. When you started day trading, I saw that you used SureTrader for trading but what did you use for scanning potential stocks? Also which new broker did you decide to go with? Thank you for the inspiration to be a Day Trader.
1356 2018-04-01 02:32:05 Anyone deemed mentally ill by a court can't legally buy a gun. Criminals don't follow laws. 
The NRA has also agreed with the ban on bump stocks, and on temporary gun restraining orders.

1368 2018-04-01 02:14:11 Bump stocks are now illegal. Military style rifles are nearly impossible to acquire background checks have been improved this is all stuff trump addressed in his recent speech. And there are mandatory mental health checks before you buy a gun.
1369 2018-04-01 02:13:58 It’s not actually an assault rifle unless it has a bump stock like in Vegas, which bump stocks are soon to be banned

1374 2018-04-01 02:06:57 Solution: Guns. Ban bump stocks. Universal gun license database with 30 day wait. Zero in on the individuals with mental and violent back grounds. Penalize gun sellers for license violations.

1409 2018-04-01 01:18:20 Not advice or a recommendation but usually less risk is better as someone gets closer to retirement. Shifting from stocks and more into income generation and capital preservation.

1428 2018-04-01 00:47:30 seems to me Umicore is one of the best EV pure-plays because within 24 months its cathode powder business will be over 50% of its revenues.  Do you have any other names for us?  (other than mining stocks)  Any other cathode, anode, or separator names that are doing well?
1429 2018-04-01 00:46:55 Hmmm but you didn’t have kids shooting up the schools. I’m not against outlawing bump stocks or large capacity magazines, or even raising the age limit to 21. I’m against messing with the 2nd amendment.
1430 2018-04-01 00:46:24 @DominiqueMonar2 so what happened we controlled the count we never swung at everything and we win so don’t question my thoughts. . You must be bad at your stocks as bad as calling out people.
1431 2018-04-01 00:43:56 No shit right. My LGS never stocks them.
1432 2018-04-01 00:42:16 Let’s be professional stock investment analyst & not refer to a stocks price dropping as a correction please. If a price drops and you call it a correction then you are implying that a price increase was incorrect. Get real and call it a price decline when it drops, thanks

1437 2018-04-01 00:35:15 I actually agree about semi-automatic weapons.  It's the methodology that's being undertaken to undo this.  Remember, the Obama administration passed through "bump stocks."  There is more to this story than we know.

1439 2018-04-01 00:32:02 I am as pro gun as you can get. But bump stocks where abused by idiots YouTubers, they are the people that brought attention to the Bump stock to begin with. Yes @POTUS lied and caused a lot of his base voters to turn on him. But the real people to blame is YouTubers.

1458 2018-04-01 00:08:01 Vegas had guns with bump stocks, you may not call that a modification, but many do. As for other shootings, imagine the damage had they the skill or knew someone who did. I’m told my friends who are gunsmiths even I have the skill. I haven’t done any smithing since mid 70’s.

1466 2018-04-01 00:01:36 As a democrat, I want a ban on assault weapons & bump stocks, not a repeal of the 2nd amendment.  Meet me on this  keep your gun. But keep it carefully locked up. My grandfathers very white health worker’s son stole his and shot a gas station attendant with it in a holdup.

1526 2018-03-31 23:15:45 Isn't it against the law for a sitting President to target and criticize a private company doing business legally? the Prez can throw shade on an industry but not on a specific company. His voice can devalue the company's stocks and cause the company harm.

1537 2018-03-31 23:09:01 Las Vegas shooting happened at the end of September. 4-1/2 months later a school in Florida gets shot up. 1-1/2 months after that, bump stocks are banned. Stalling, any solutions, just leads to more drastic measures. Denigrate their passion, because you don’t agree. No help.

1543 2018-03-31 23:03:44 I have some hi cap mags; they are a pain in the ass, so I really don't care.  The bump stocks only work under ideal conditions and are useless unless you're immobile and shooting fish in a barrel.  Don't be fooled BUMP STOCKS ARE A JOKE!.  So I don't care if they go away.
1544 2018-03-31 23:03:31 That's because the mile is ban Military grade weapons, bump stocks, high cap magazines, require background checks. Vast majority of #GunReformNow and students do not want to repeal 2A. Many of us/them are responsible gun owners & hunters, we just want common sense laws.

1550 2018-03-31 22:56:25 Does preparing pitches to suit whatever bowling stocks a country have constitute cheating? If so we should ban every grounds keeper under the outraged moralistic pc wowser that is calling for these lads to be banned forever. Forgiveness is the best virtue any person can have.
1551 2018-03-31 22:55:49 Stocks are a very risky business and most people don't have disposable income to risk.

1554 2018-03-31 22:54:39 When gun owners r asked why they need assault weapons, hi cap mags, bump stocks etc. some often respond w/why do u need alcohol sales?etc. Alcohol can kill those who abuse it but people don’t kill people w/alcohol. What’s wrong w/universal background checks & age limit of 21?
1555 2018-03-31 22:54:23 I thought 1$ stocks r risky enough  look @ wat we got here; Do u also short penny stocks? $GERN was a great short from da 6s

1559 2018-03-31 22:47:49 Yes, Ted Nugent has really done that, hasn't he? And besides bragging about sexual predation, he buys land, stocks it with trapped animals, and kills them.

1561 2018-03-31 22:45:07 None of which were domestic intrusions which was the topic. Noticed you did not mention Yountville CA, Millcroft PA, and Rancho Tehema CA, all this year alone. Vegas involved military styled weapons with legal bump stocks and we know what they can do

1564 2018-03-31 22:44:01 Kinda like making sure you tell people they weren't shot by Assault Rifles, but instead mere Assault Weapons with folding stocks and barrel shrouds.  It's so useful to fact check irrelevant semantics in the middle of a discussion.

1568 2018-03-31 22:38:01 Good things weapons of war are illegal.  The military doesn’t use semi automatic rifles.  Why would they? They use machine guns.  Bump stocks absolutely should be banned. They turn a semi automatic rifle into a machine gun.  Machine guns are illegal.

1584 2018-03-31 22:20:15 Gun Stocks down temporarily is a buying opportunity, gun sales will be up, just like #NRA Donations tripled last month. The Over Emotional Left always overreaches, pisses off the silent majority and loses in the end.

1591 2018-03-31 22:14:16 “The Vermont bill raises the age for gun purchases to 21 and expands background checks for private gun sales. It also bans magazines of more than 10 rounds for long guns and 15 rounds for pistols as well as rapid-fire devices known as bump stocks.”

1598 2018-03-31 22:07:00 Pretty sure that’s much more than NRA got. You know what’s happening on Wall Street w funds & gun related stocks?

Plus over 500K new volunteers, new chapters for Brady, Moms, Giffords etc...
And gun manufacturers are struggling financially.
In the end it’ll be abt voter turnout.

1607 2018-03-31 21:57:43 Just saw some guy's tweet that said by 2030 everyone will be using cryptocurrencies and stocks will be worthless.  Somehow, I don't think he's right.
1608 2018-03-31 21:57:32 There will always be under-performing stocks and bearish stories of doom and misery, but for most people that’s a sure road to the poorhouse.
1609 2018-03-31 21:57:07 There’s a possibility that this bull market might be ending, but the evidence I’m seeing in the charts and price action of leading stocks today is not supporting that.

1617 2018-03-31 21:50:37 I think we need to do both. Not all guns need to be the focus, but those that can kill a large number of people in a short period of time.  We outlaw grenades. These semiautomatic weapons with high capacity magazines are one step down. Bump stocks are = .
1618 2018-03-31 21:50:14 Jesus Brenda, do you know who the "shareholders" are?! It's everyday folks like you and me who own stocks in these companies and invest in 401Ks...
1619 2018-03-31 21:49:14 The politicians merely needed cover by the events created by intelligence agencies and the Vatican's dupes in Media, Hollywood, and Government.

1641 2018-03-31 21:27:02 @guyrelford sorry that's not a quote, but you said before you don't think bump stocks are under the purview of the Second Amendment, and while I'm not in favor of them either, I have trouble reconciling this
1642 2018-03-31 21:25:07 i do what i want 
1643 2018-03-31 21:23:23 No, while I am a gun owner, I also support common sense gun control laws. Bump stocks and extended ammo clips along with gun modification kits should be banned. Better background checks, and violent criminals and psych patients barred from owning weapons.
1644 2018-03-31 21:22:20 Kennedy immediately thought that if the shoeshine people were getting into stocks, it was time for him to get out.

1648 2018-03-31 21:18:58 @guyrelford what about when you said I support the Second Amendment but don't think it applies to bump stocks
1649 2018-03-31 21:18:15 Is there a webinar on pot stocks?  Thx
1650 2018-03-31 21:18:05 Who do you think makes up the NRA or are you truly that ignorant? Further, the NRA agreed and pushed for a ban of bump fire stocks that the Vegas shooter used to ease his murderous actions. When you don't know anything about firearms, you probably shouldn't speak about them.
1651 2018-03-31 21:17:11 I'm surprised I don't get more questions about pot stocks.

I know more about pot than I do about bitcoin.

Read into that what you will.
1652 2018-03-31 21:14:57 With accessories it can easily become fully automatic. (Why we liberals don't like bump stocks) But many also feel that we should expand the definition to include more semi autos because they are so very deadly.

1655 2018-03-31 21:13:48 Hi Dana, no I only use the 10% rule of thumb for crypto because it can be very volatile and unpredictable. I'm much more comfortable having a higher % of net worth in more traditional assets like stocks, bonds, real estate etc
1656 2018-03-31 21:13:37 Young folks these days, nobody asking about Pot Stocks? Cryptocurrency and Pot are the "streets are paved in gold" Siren song of this year. You know who makes money on Cryptocurrency? I don't! (run an exchange, or make up your own cryptocurrency?)
1657 2018-03-31 21:12:17 The sponsors are cowards and I hope their stocks tank.
1658 2018-03-31 21:11:20 Disclaimer I am a gun owner. I believe that guns should be regulated uniformly across the nation to include registration, licensure, proof of competency, mandatory insurance, restrictions on HC magazines, bump stocks. Restrict assault style weapons to a higher tier of competency.
1659 2018-03-31 21:11:12 Gun reform,, today bump stocks, tomorrow  semi automatic, day after pump action, , then  the 6 shooter, then the musket, because gun reform does not work.
1660 2018-03-31 21:10:51 That was preceded by a super-bull run by BTC... same happens with stock markets: first the blue chip stocks rise, then high-risk stocks follow. I highly doubt we’ll see another bull run in alts before btc gets out of its downtrend

1663 2018-03-31 21:08:10 With the savings account interest rates at practically zero, there almost no such thing as compound interest. Nothing x Nothing = Nothing. Best advise is money market IRA so you can buy stocks, bonds and other securities.

All of the rewards from his tax cuts have gone to corporations and to the rich, who hold corporate stocks, and not to ordinary Americans. 

Also: cheats on both taxes and wives. Not good, eh ?

1684 2018-03-31 20:48:06 Remember when Kiyosaki was telling us all to dump stocks in 2016 and was predicting a great collapse? Since then, stocks ripped higher. Now he's telling you they're going to continue to rise. That means you should now sell your stocks and get ready for another market correction.
1685 2018-03-31 20:47:52 Every time Trump attacks an American company on Twitter, impacting their stock price, it should trigger an audit of his companies, relatives, associates,  and subsidiaries. Has anyone checked to see who is shorting those stocks 48 hours before a tweet? #MuellerInvestigation

1690 2018-03-31 20:43:59 When W was implicated in the S&L scandal, his name was quickly pulled from the picture and a false narrative was created where some old personal enemies were falsely accused and ruined or killed

The truth is those so-called penny stocks?
 Just a paper trail used to finance drugs
1691 2018-03-31 20:43:50 Okay.  First, test everyone who wants to own a gun.  As we do when someone wants to drive a car.  Register and insure that gun.  Have that gun inspected every year.  Ban bump stocks, ban AR-15s and all automatic rifles.  Raise the age limit to 21.
1692 2018-03-31 20:43:48 Good news of the Day :
Vermont Gov. Phil Scott says he will sign sweeping gun control measures that include a ban on bump stocks, limits on the size of magazines, the expansion of background checks on buyers and the raising of the purchase age.

1699 2018-03-31 20:37:05 Congrats to the state of VT! This well-conceived set of laws has zero impact on hunters, who don’t use bump stocks or need high capacity magazines, is entirely consistent with the 2nd Amendment and will save innocent lives. Kudos
1700 2018-03-31 20:35:14 You seem ignorant of the TO (Territorial Defense). These units were well armed and they were the ones who started the attacks against the JNA. There was also weapons smuggling in the run-up to the war. Bosniaks had HUGE stocks of explosives already at the start.
1701 2018-03-31 20:34:46 same i say its thé normal market cycle. You even see this behaviour in stocks lol. I think some fiat/ stock traders have got in the game. We did not see these cycles when btc started. but hey i could be wrong, but rigth at the same time because there are other variable.
1702 2018-03-31 20:33:43 AR does not mean assault rifle. An M16 is one. Bump stocks are an addition that makes the AR work like an M16. That should be illegal just like a sawed off shotgun.
1703 2018-03-31 20:33:16 A civilian rifle modeled after military weapons. Extremely popular with gun enthusiasts for it's customizability. Semi-automatic, but can be modified with bump stocks for near-automatic rates of fire.
1704 2018-03-31 20:32:01 U of all people should be talking about taxes. FYI. Amazon paid almost 1 Billion in taxes last year. 957 mill to be exact. What did u pay ?  As far as Post Office. Amazon ships almost everything UPS. Check their stocks. It's thru the roof. Ur some genius.
1705 2018-03-31 20:31:37 Yes, thats a great way to put it. I learned about stocks by actually doing it and trading and same with saving money. finances become more fun once you have actually learned and can partake without being stressed.

1708 2018-03-31 20:28:53 From my past experience with stocks, When they are so many trolls trolling $AVZ it's a good sign for upward as all these down-rampers are preparing to make their position by scaring off the mum & dad, nervous nelly holders so they can buy in cheap.

$AVZ is real monster
1709 2018-03-31 20:26:11 Bump stocks CAN be removed without altering existing principles. To alter needlessly indicates a WILLFUL attempt to "over-ban", and that means TRICKERY from ATF. It means they made the FIRST mistake intentionally, in typical Obama Alinsky style.

No matter what - WE'RE WATCHING.

(1) the ATF was WRONG on bump stocks by their own principles
(2) they have been WILLFULLY misinterpreting to change the principles
(3) existing principles don't need to change on this
(4) if they change the principles, Trump needs to FIRE people BIGLY

1733 2018-03-31 19:59:24 My personal position is that bump stocks are a simple violation of the "one bullet per trigger PULL" principle, since the gun itself PUSHING the trigger is a sneaky form of automation using the WHOLE GUN. What this means is good for us:

THE CURRENT RULES DON'T NEED TO CHANGE.
1734 2018-03-31 19:57:44 $521 million for that lottery @_@ let's say after taxes I get 150mil. i'd give 50 mil to friends (not in big enough portions to trigger the gift tax lol), save, keep or spend 50 mil, and then portion out the rest in stocks and real estate.

1738 2018-03-31 19:55:06 Trump has already made the move to ban bump stocks through DOJ. However, we are in a MANDATED COMMENT PERIOD.  So there is still time to comment on HOW and WHETHER bump stocks should be banned. Gun owners should avail themselves of this opportunity from MANY DIFFERENT ANGLES.
1739 2018-03-31 19:48:48 Looking forward to it. OCSY has been disrespected for too long. A lot of trashy penny stocks with no financials have higher valuations. I'd love to see people chase this stock someday and regret not getting it at below bargain basement prices.
1740 2018-03-31 19:48:21 All of there stocks are going to free all.hahaha
1741 2018-03-31 19:47:49 Trump's approach is the best Second Amendment advance we've witnessed in a long time.  He acknowledges the worries of non-gun owners/enthusiasts after 17 children lying dead in their school.  O.K., "let's get rid of bump stocks, BUT, let's ARM OUR SCHOOLS."

1749 2018-03-31 19:41:06 Lincoln, Ne city council banned bump stocks last week. It's a start.
1750 2018-03-31 19:36:37 I'm good with the first 2 to an extent on number 1. Last one makes no sense. Military style weapons aren't legal. And bump stocks are still one bullet everytime you pull the trigger. They do not make a gun fully automatic.

1754 2018-03-31 19:35:06 The reason they attacked Trump supporters was pure PSYCHOLOGY. It was supposed to be a ONE-TWO PUNCH.

(1) Trump supporters are struck but stand strong, looking to Trump for leadership

(2) Trump likely bans bump stocks, and when he does, ATF BANS MORE - Trump's base betrayed
1755 2018-03-31 19:35:04 The gun owners I know don't use AR-15's or bump stocks. Are you saying you do?
1756 2018-03-31 19:34:46 I would say that the left doesnt fully understand the position of the NRA and Parkland students like @KyleKashuv mostly because of the media bias. And we ARE working together, hence the talks about banning bump stocks and background checks putting emphasis on mental health.

1770 2018-03-31 19:19:55 No gun control is reasonable!!! No bans on assault rifles (those aren't a thing), no ban on ammunition! No ban of magazine sizes! No ban on bump stocks! No ban of green tipped bullets!! No any kind of Ban!!!
1771 2018-03-31 19:19:09 Fb stocks.
1772 2018-03-31 19:19:02 That’s fine sensible gun control still warranted. It’s was legal to have an assault weapon ban, bump stocks mimic machine guns and even POTUS agreed it should be illegal. There is no reason on earth to have military weapons in the hand of civilians. Drain the NRA SWAMP in 2018
1773 2018-03-31 19:18:49 The brow is gone... Sell all of your AD stocks IMMEDIATELY!!!
1774 2018-03-31 19:18:38 The databases we subscribe to (and depend on as primary data sources for the US Uber Cannibals portfolio) do not have reliable data on Indian stocks and at this time we don't have much interest in doing this for Indian stocks.
1775 2018-03-31 19:18:20 Also, I have a fear that Facebook's data mining scheme might be going on at other sites like Amazon, Google, and the others that make up the FANG stocks.
1776 2018-03-31 19:17:09 AR-15's, bump stocks, and hi cap mags are not commonly used in mass shootings or even "regular" gun murders (data from Mother Jones). So, how does that equate to "blood is on your hands"? #FactsMatter Additionally, cities with strictest gun control = most murders. Who's hands?
1777 2018-03-31 19:16:15 I dont have $10k in my bank account either. I bought $AMZN when it went on sale 2 days ago., Why would anyone want to keep $10k in bank account and earn an interest less than inflation? How do you know money is not being saved by investing in first home or stocks?
1778 2018-03-31 19:15:20 Depends of which stocks you point to. News about changes to status quo (e.g., tariffs) wil create movement based on sentiment.
1779 2018-03-31 19:14:38 @realDonaldTrump I don't believe you have the tenacity or the backbone to uphold the Second Amendment. You're already actively trying to ban bump stocks and rate increasing devices via DOJ. Why should legal American Citizens who own firearms & bump stocks believe a word you say?

1791 2018-03-31 19:03:00 It’s difficult to listen to the broken hearts as they speak the pain within. It is a labor of love to listen to the Parkland parents & especially the students.  It is time to act. Ban assault weapons & accessories, ban bump stocks, ban lrg cap mags, for civilian use/no loopholes.
1792 2018-03-31 19:01:53 .How about the money the tax payers lost so your billionaire buddies could by back own stocks instead of paying taxes.
1793 2018-03-31 19:01:14 And there should be 'stocks' for the politicians and all the bureaucrats that wasted millions of $$ on a THREE lane bridge. Unreal, 2018, ONE lane coming downtown.  Really party was 4 those that pocketed extra millions over 4 years.

When you see horrible news about a company & the price goes up..Buyer Beware its probably institutional investors running up the price to sell it to US before the crash.
1814 2018-03-31 18:38:44 Nugent long ago turned into a deranged survivalist that can't see anything other than extremes. The Parkland survivors DON'T want to take your guns, they support sensible gun laws. Like getting assault weapons off the streets. Outlawing bump stocks. Universal background checks.

1838 2018-03-31 18:15:13 Just watched #TheChinaHustle. Excellent expose on Chinese reverse merger scams in the US. If you're worried about the US losing a trade war to a corrupt to its core China, you won't be after watching this. Of course Trump and team know all of this. Avoid Chinese stocks.

1842 2018-03-31 18:14:02 Has to be another way. If those companies stocks drop to low. Soros will come in and buy up. That's what he does.  Its a win win for him. Have to find out which companies he has and boycott
1843 2018-03-31 18:13:06 3. Bump stocks.  Silencers.  Fomenting conspiracy fear w/members that Feds are going to confiscate guns. The cynical slippery slope argument. Wouldn’t have a problem if #NRA truly encouraged responsible ownership, not extremism.  They’ve become a domestic terrorist org.
1844 2018-03-31 18:12:42 Most new ones do. Some States mandate the sale of it for child safety. So it's just done universally since it's easier to maintain one stock than two stocks, one with a $5 lock and one without.
1845 2018-03-31 18:09:25 The goal is to BREAK the principle to make a new one. ATF has already threatened that they will begin cutting into semi-auto if bump stocks are banned.

THEY EXPOSE THE GOAL OF THE PLOT RIGHT THERE.

They could EASILY fix things, but won't. PASSIVE AGGRESSION - PURE OBAMA.
1846 2018-03-31 18:08:55 Maybe a serving job, otherwise diverting attention to finishing my degree and putting the rest of my eggs into swinging some stocks!
1847 2018-03-31 18:07:59 Lord. They've been talking about a bump stock ban forever. Besides, bump stocks are lame af. You have no accuracy and it just allows you to shoot a bunch of rounds randomly.
1848 2018-03-31 18:05:52 I mined it for a few years. I bought it under $400 I only scraped about 20ish% of my total long to pay off college loans, mortgage, buy a new SUV and invested into pharma stocks. I put away 100k for kids college. Took 10ish % and started swing trading and up 60%.  1of2

GOOD NEWS for pms fund managers..., Wise and famous streets talks about one side bullishness from Monday onwards... hope some relief for PMS managed stocks...
1850 2018-03-31 18:05:12 It is ENTIRELY POSSIBLE to see by multiple physical arguments that bump stocks don't actually conform to the existing solid principles of semi-auto fire - that they allow the GUN to determine the next shot - not the person. They are easily ruled out. Why not do it? STRATEGY.
1851 2018-03-31 18:04:50 You mean the type of adult brain the focused his previous two tweets discreditimg teenagers.  Sensible guns laws?  How about we ban bump stocks and start universal background checks?  Now, that's sensible.  If you think this is only about mental health, younare mistaken.
1852 2018-03-31 18:03:53 About to go racing in the Mini Stocks.  Cars still getting lined up.
1853 2018-03-31 18:01:48 You really think that would happen here and now? Come on, this isn't 1930's Nazi Germany and they're not trying to take your guns, how about sticking to the issues they're addressing, stricter background checks, ban sales to mentally ill, ban bump stocks...too much?

1855 2018-03-31 17:59:52 Yeah. For young people I recommend they invest in stocks and other securities to build wealth, then later channel it to real estate investment.
1856 2018-03-31 17:59:33 You think over stretching and under funding the Navy is fine?

We'll need to get them from somewhere after brexit has destroyed the industry here.

That is a shame, good politicians unlike Farage the absent.
1857 2018-03-31 17:58:47 Newly retired, but not early.  Darn!  Many congrats to those doing so!  Anyway,
what do you think of preferred stocks for higher dividends with rising interest rates and the volatile US market?
1858 2018-03-31 17:58:15 There different returns depending on which ETFs you choose you can opt for bond ETFs , gold ETFs or ETFs that offer you a diverse basket of stocks the return can range from 2% to 25% annually
1859 2018-03-31 17:57:53 Do you even know the current laws that you claim to want to change? Automatic weapons are already illegal and have been for a long time. Also, bump stocks are no longer being manufactured and are on the way to being illegal. This is why many  don’t take this movement seriously...
1860 2018-03-31 17:57:42 Then it came the day when swarms of hungry Italians robbed all local stores of their stocks of rosemary. I saw it coming.
1861 2018-03-31 17:57:08 I already am.  We need to do more.  Are these stocks of these companies ready to fall?

1863 2018-03-31 17:54:45 If I have learned anything about using MyFitnessPal again it is that it is not built for someone who cooks at home and creates things from scratch. It assumes literally everything is bought. Like...I make bread, grind my own meat, and make my own stocks. Not conducive.

1866 2018-03-31 17:51:44 Yep. I know bump stocks don't, and the fact that those kits are illegal proves to non-morons that you can't have them legally. Oh, and they aren't the choice of mass killers; most use handguns. Any other lies you want to peddle?
1867 2018-03-31 17:50:58 Most of what I agree with already has bipartisan support. 1) Mandatory minimum age of 21 for all semi-automatic rifles (just like handguns). 2) Ban on bump stocks (which should have happened after Vegas. 3) Close gun show loopholes & background checks for private sales.
1868 2018-03-31 17:49:38 ..a ton of stock market classes, earned my Bloomberg certification, & have interned on Wall Street through family connections.

1870 2018-03-31 17:46:53 It's our TURN NOW! We the people will Boycott all the companies pulling ads from Laur's show. Don't just boycott them if you have stocks hit them where it hurts SELL SELL SELL- Companies that pulled ads from Laura Ingraham.. Nestle 1-800-637-8536 Nutrish. 800-323-7738...
1871 2018-03-31 17:44:05 I would advice you to look at gold mining stocks.
1872 2018-03-31 17:43:50 Who does that anyway? Common medicines can be kept in stock. Making the patients family run around in search of an injection just cuz they ran out is not done. Managing stocks, Coordination with other med stores or a centralised database can be done too.
1873 2018-03-31 17:43:41 Why do I say ATF misdeeds? 

It is now clear that Democrats have SET UP THESE EVENTS over a period of DECADES. Just like Biden made schools sitting ducks, it's clear that ATF helped Obama set up Las Vegas.

We must assume that ATF is STILL RUNNING THEIR PLOT on bump stocks.
1874 2018-03-31 17:40:40 All day while stocks last!
1875 2018-03-31 17:38:13 Very true. What these companies will discover is that they lose some business and gain some business. Other advertisers will buy new ads. The boycotter company stocks will largely suffer. In a few months, they will ask: What is this even about and why are we involved?
1876 2018-03-31 17:35:43 It's important to see both the minutiae of sabotage and the big picture. Obama USED an intentional ATF misruling on bump stocks to create an OPPORTUNITY for gun law, then EXPLOITED IT. @Thomas1774Paine and FBI white hats know the truth - #LasVega was an FBI-SJW PROPAGANDA EVENT.
1877 2018-03-31 17:30:41 Did he mentioned how many times he filed bankruptcies on his construction projects and building businesses.Fooling and destroying not only those stock holders who bought the stocks of his projects they left penny less and he become billions dollar man

1886 2018-03-31 17:25:00 Market correction of overvalued stocks.
1887 2018-03-31 17:23:57 It’s why the US Govt establishes the SEC. Joe Kennedy was a master of manipulating stocks. So FDR made him ruler of nascent SEC. Saying it takes a crook to know how crooks think.
1888 2018-03-31 17:22:51 But even then, some screens don't have room for names that are too long, and I haven't come up with a good solution for everything yet.

(The stocks screen scares me a lot, for example... x.x )
1889 2018-03-31 17:22:39 I like to be presented with arguments as to why my stocks won't succeed.
1890 2018-03-31 17:22:35 Silencers? Aren't those regulated as per National Firearms Act 1934?
Bump Stocks could/should fall under same laws & be a registered mod, as the NRA smartly pushed for.
Then, only those who are brave enough to be watch dogged by fed gov can legally acquire them via fed license.
1891 2018-03-31 17:21:49 Why don't we just put them in stocks outside lords and pelt them with tomatoes and rotten veg, jeez give it a rest, you'd thought they'd killed someone based on the hysteria.
1892 2018-03-31 17:20:59 Next year instead of buying the show I am going to buy SDS Stocks.  Watch out @BillGates I might be moving into a house in you neighborhood
1893 2018-03-31 17:20:38 They don't. The NRA could have always chosen to be something else. They're a bunch of adults. They could have defended blacks who are gun owners in cities and get encarcerated at higher rates. They could have argued against bump stocks. They chose paranoia insanity racism + money
1894 2018-03-31 17:20:06 Cisco systems (CSCO) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) stocks both up  over 12% this year already, and it's still very affordable. Not too late to buy at good price.
1895 2018-03-31 17:17:22 Wondered why you were so up on your stocks n shares recently
1896 2018-03-31 17:16:31 I don't watch any news and my trades seem to work ok. I look up articles on the individual stocks I'm trading and often that news is just absorbed...
1897 2018-03-31 17:16:24 Bump stocks - I understand the argument for banning them. I’ll be honest, my only issue with it is the slippery slope argument. And that’s just me being honest. I see them as pointless, only degrading accuracy and causing a gun to overheat.
1898 2018-03-31 17:16:05 So you deny the existence of bump stocks and illegal kits to change a semiautomatic to full automatic? Let's get real these assault rifles are the weapon of choice of mass killers for a reason they are effective killing machines and are readily available.
1899 2018-03-31 17:16:00 Assets don’t have to be houses and cars they can be a business and stocks be creative there many ways to create wealth
1900 2018-03-31 17:15:28 media owners & politicians are heavily invested in military stocks. why would they listen?
1901 2018-03-31 17:15:06 I'm long or short the market every day & sometimes in the same day depending when our glorious POTUS decides to open his mouth. For individual stocks Iike at the money straddles especially close to earnings. They are non directional and are a play on the volatility we are seeing.
1902 2018-03-31 17:14:52 The problem is that is an invention since Reagan. 401K is based on stocks, that was unheard of and too risky back when this country was great. Unions (CWA1181) Healthcare and Pensions made this country. What is middle class to you?
1903 2018-03-31 17:14:28 Take your money out of trx and put it in penny stocks! What you have learned in "crypto" will make you a beast on penny stocks! Trust me the dips aren't as bad as crypto and you can do more research on companies. Crypto is rigged!
1904 2018-03-31 17:13:57 Very well said, and in relation to companies and stocks, coins dont go bankrupt or sell all underlaying assets.
1905 2018-03-31 17:13:57 The majority fire 9mm or 40 caliber that’s what a handgun uses. The AR 15 uses .223 ammo. That smaller than a deer rifle. They’re only getting a bad rap because of their appearance and people using them most. Not even the bump stocks makes them automatic.
1906 2018-03-31 17:12:14 Laura shouldn't have been made to apologize.  It's just like bump stocks, ban them to make libs happy and they reach for more.  Same with Laura, apologize, and it' not enough.  Ignore these crazies.

1912 2018-03-31 17:07:28 Trump is riding a wave that had already started, moron. He didn't bring his manufacturing back. He is running our finances into the ground. Mass shootings up. My paycheck is stagnant, and my stocks are down. Btw...notice he only takes credit when things are good? 
1913 2018-03-31 17:06:27 i’m also having this struggling rn

1915 2018-03-31 17:05:53 why do my parents have weed stocks
1916 2018-03-31 17:05:21 I need to stop with this treat yourself attitude because I’ve got a whole new wardrobe on the way 
1917 2018-03-31 17:04:12 After combining Buffett, Fisher, Lynch & Marks' philosophy, I have selected 3 Indian stocks as great buys.
These would also benefit tremendously from Kim Jong Uh's softening stance and will become multibaggers.
For more info, plz call 9822012345
1918 2018-03-31 17:03:35 Correct. Wiggs couldn’t hit a shot and yet he did everything else he possibly could have to positively impact the game. He played hard. The hustle was there. He dug into Barnes. 5 stocks.
1919 2018-03-31 17:03:32 That is precisely my point, in addition to increased background checks and a ban on bump stocks (at bare minimum) we need mandatory training for anyone who applies for the privilege to own a deadly weapon. You are doing great work, it was amazing to walk out and march.
1920 2018-03-31 16:59:26 Bump stocks should be stuck under a class 3 federal firearms license (ATF).

High round magazine capacity does not really do much because bad guys are probably going to bring along more mags (pre loaded) + extra guns.
It does not really change what the determined can/will do. :/

1968 2018-03-31 16:50:14 A discount broker called F6 Online/F6 Finserve has run away with money and also sold all the stocks in pool account at whatever price they got and vanished.

2016 2018-03-31 16:40:00 If you've been watching, President Trump has already banned " bump stocks, " expanded background checks to unprecedented reach; Did Barrack Obama do anything when we saw 160+ mass shootings during his eight years? No, nothing.
2017 2018-03-31 16:39:41 Amazon saw the future and capitalized on his vision. I'm not an attorney, but a class action suit can only be based on how much the company is damaged because of libel, i.e. stocks fall. Unfortunately the orange one is entitled to his opinion. WS is right, abuse of power!
2018 2018-03-31 16:38:09 Be specific. They asked for comprehensive background checks (not taking guns away), increase age to purchase (not taking guns away), increased waiting period (not taking guns away), ban on bump stocks (not taking guns away), banning AR15s (this one takes a certain type away).

2023 2018-03-31 16:36:48 Response:  “call your members of Congress, invest in socially responsible stocks that don’t support nuclear weapons makers, and join grassroots movements through groups like ICAN and Global Zero that advocate for nonproliferation.”
2024 2018-03-31 16:36:37 With a move like that I'd guess a slow grind sideways/up until the gap is closed before it makes a decision. That said, most US stocks look a bit shaky to me atm.

2030 2018-03-31 16:34:14 Logic states the full background checks, banning bump stocks and a few other common sense measures would decrease gun deaths.   Isn’t that what we all want?   Seriously? Isn’t that what we want?
2031 2018-03-31 16:34:00 Hi no need for the term 'idiot'? Can you show me the voting at the December fisheries council? Will show how the UK minister - democratically elected - voted on the UK's behalf. Often was the UK pushing to reduce quotas to save stocks. See eg sea bass last year.

2033 2018-03-31 16:31:48 Ok, I will bite.. how do you claim these tax breaks that permanently lowered taxes for corporations and the wealthy are good for the middle class?  Most of the money saved is used to buy back Stocks, and huge bonuses for the executives?  Ask Kansas how well trickle down works.
2034 2018-03-31 16:30:23 Okay, let's get down to brass tacks.  Do you support the selling of assault-style weapons?  Bump stocks? Do you support "following the money" to see where the NRA receives its $$$?  Hell, do you support 45 kissing Putin's ass?
2035 2018-03-31 16:30:00 What is being asked of you? Raise the age limit on the purchase of assault rifles in Florida. Make bump stocks illegal. 
Think about the price these kids paid with their LIVES. What is being asked of you, by these kids, these children is to not die in their schools.
2036 2018-03-31 16:29:04 Actually all the big mass shooting have been AR-15s and the biggest one (Las Vegas) was AR-15s and bump stocks.
2037 2018-03-31 16:28:13 The long term value thesis seems fine. The problem is if you believe the market will correct, high-PE stocks get hit first and hardest. Which means the market should offer a much better entry into stocks like NVIDIA.
2038 2018-03-31 16:26:53 So, about a year and a half ago, I thought I should "adult" and buy some stocks. I researched what was expected with various companies, and chose one secure-but-slow-growing, and one less secure but faster-growing. Yep, I bought stock in Tesla. Groan.
2039 2018-03-31 16:25:43 What authority are you speaking of?  The Constitution gives every American the authority to bear arms. The Constitution speaks nothing about background checks and bump stocks.
2040 2018-03-31 16:25:22 Universal background checks for ALL gun & ammunition sales or transfers. 
Red flag laws. 
Ban bump stocks

Nothing but logic in my desired policy changes.
2041 2018-03-31 16:25:18 Thats the product of inexperienced traders  and the impatient. The patient always win, when it comes to stocks, this is no different. All these new coiners were promised lambos and to go to moon, after 2 months of them not getting them, they left.
2042 2018-03-31 16:25:06 These cryto 'stocks' are derivitaves. NOT actual 'cyrptos'. Highly manipulative with no accountability. If one is truely interested in cryptos, go straight to the source, not peripheral bs. Just buy the actual cryptos. Bitcoin, Litecoin, Etherium etc. Blockchain Don't be fooled
2043 2018-03-31 16:24:19 @AsdaServiceTeam Belvedere. No fresh herbs & three broken self service tills. Every “feast” time (Xmas, Easter, New Year etc) this supermarket never stocks enough. Never again #Lidl #sainsburys #ASDA

2092 2018-03-31 16:18:30 ABSOLUTELY! Carl Icahn dumped steel stocks before Trump's tariff annoucoment, and I now presume that any company or industry-specific announcement by Trump is accompanied by beaucoup insider trading to enrich friends and family.

His comments pushed Amazon stocks down. Can we see if any of his inner circle profited from shorting the stock before this nutty statements???
2105 2018-03-31 16:11:12 Is this really news? Who cares what celebrities think! So how’s the stocks today? How’s the economy today? How life in put a Rico today seven months after the hurricane? Our tour guide still has no power after it hit. That’s news, not what she thinks.

2114 2018-03-31 16:04:37 Can I ask for advice on a specific stock? $whlr seems like a dying stock. Its based under a REIT going for $3.58 with a steady decline from $50 a share over 5 yrs. However, the dividends are at a whopping 40% ($1.44 per share) would this be a smart move to go in with $1000?

2195 2018-03-31 15:40:03 The solution is to add more of the quality scrips if one has enough cash. 

Else, sit tight and avoid offloading the quality stocks.

2198 2018-03-31 15:39:05 As that young'un, Delaney Tarr, said at the "March For Our Lives" about bump stocks, "give us an inch, we'll take a mile". Laura should NEVER have apologized. It just gave approval to Hogg for his reaction. Which was fascistic.
2199 2018-03-31 15:37:21 M8 the Democrats aren’t much better. Obama did jack shit to stop anything in the 8yrs that he served. Trump banned bump stocks in his first half of his first term
2200 2018-03-31 15:35:43 I'd love to see evidence that gun control would help anything. Donald trump said himself he is planning to ban bump stocks, increase background checks, and raise the age to 21. Want to stop shootings? Give qualified teachers firearms
2201 2018-03-31 15:35:41 You brought this dammmm subject 1000 time.  
It is called amazon not CNN, unless you own a big stocks in amazon??  Do you? 
If not, then that is his job as a president and both of you can kiss his end.
2202 2018-03-31 15:35:05 I often wonder why people are so worried about quarterly results despite the fact that stocks are meant to be very long term investments. If you look ten or twenty years from now, one bad quarter doesn’t mean anything. Would you sell your own company after couple of bad months?

2207 2018-03-31 15:30:37 Wow! That's just nuts! 
Also Lisa's mother is the main (lier) lawyer for Nicolas Cruz the supposed Fla. Shooting..
Not mention this kid got a inheritance of 37,000 cash, stocks in Microsoft and a few "other" assets. Can it really be a coincidents that they are all connected.
2208 2018-03-31 15:29:13 The issue is your entire perception about the crypto space. You & Peter think of it like trading forex, stocks & bonds. Many of the rest of us see it as a new world currency that we have bought into and are not planning to get out of. That's why I have been 'HODLing' from 2014

Advice - take deep breaths. The threat is from overzealous gun owners.  No-one will take your fun away, just limit access by militant, angry, desperate or just plain evil folks.
2212 2018-03-31 15:25:23 May you be put in the stocks! May you be tarred and feathered! Drawn & quartered!  No. I’m kidding. This is just for fun, not prizes. Nothing bad is going to happen. 
2213 2018-03-31 15:25:10 Vermont became a state in 1791.  

You're saying that they were fighting for the right to own bump stocks and high-capacity magazines?
2214 2018-03-31 15:24:06 That's why all who wants progress should support Trump in his move to ban bump stocks.  This is one change that can significantly impact mass shooting. Of course the bad guys will still try to get guns in black markets,  but the odds og getting them will increase.

2218 2018-03-31 15:21:14 As I grow as an investor, I'm starting to see the importance of both reliable dividend payers & high growth stocks which don't pay a divy. $MTCH, $TDOC & $SQ have all made me good money without receiving a cent in dividends.
2219 2018-03-31 15:19:33 simply put, I'll never understand nor believe in the "reverse logic" of selling stocks "just because" they go lower -- LOL
2220 2018-03-31 15:19:30 Not every American needs any kind of gun at any time to do whatever they want.  It is not an unreasonable restriction on the 2nd amendment to have universal background checks, to outlaw weapons of war, to have waiting periods, or to outlaw bump stocks.

2224 2018-03-31 15:18:12 There’s one in Kirkby in Ashfield. It even stocks airbrush stuff.
2225 2018-03-31 15:17:53 Of the four items in the VT bill, Bernie Sanders has voted for two of them (universal background checks, limiting magazine size) and the other two never got a US Senate vote (raising the age to buy a gun to 21, banning bump stocks).

Bernie Sanders’ rating from the NRA is 14%.
2226 2018-03-31 15:17:32 Now, I can actually agree with you on some things. The NRA is indeed part of the problem, so are military grade weapons and accessories like bump stocks, but the issues you raise are also vital, as are background checks, increased staffing for FBI and ATF...

2230 2018-03-31 15:15:50 US funders are key in supporting the demise of every resource industry in BC. BC was once the most affluent province in Canada. Thanks to foreign funded ENGOs our logging/lumber industry has been destroyed. Aquaculture is blamed for the demise of salmon stocks, mining decreased.

2273 2018-03-31 15:10:56 How is the NRA not helping? 

After Vegas, they agreed bump stocks should be subject to regulation. In parkland, laws supported by the NRA should have led to Cruz being disarmed. 

No NRA member has been a mass shooter. What exactly do you expect from gun enthusiasts?
2274 2018-03-31 15:10:41 Has anybody  thought to investigate Trump for securities fraud, maybe he’s letting his donor friends know when to jump in and out of the markets on certain stocks timed with his inappropriate statements. I think somebody should.
@washingtonpost @CNN .
Or maybe he is just jealous.

2276 2018-03-31 15:08:10 Business 101 would say that Bittrex should list it as that’s a damn lot of trades it’s not profiting on. This to me just says bittrex is dumb. If they have stocks I’ll invest a large portion in a more money hungry company.
2277 2018-03-31 15:07:33 So if i have read this right, any property or thing in possession of a human trafficker can be seized.

2278 2018-03-31 15:07:24 I jumped through all the hoops. Saw pain management doc once a month, did my drug tests, the works. But you can't fill script until day you run out, and no one stocks the meds, so you're screwed. Every. Damn. Month.
2279 2018-03-31 15:06:10 I shall revisit my case for buying the stock at 1st instance and see what changed now and decide. Still won't go overboard beyond my risk taking capacity.

2285 2018-03-31 15:03:31 Keuffel and Esser! I had charts that stretched across my den in the early 70s. First charting program I got was Metastock on an Apple 2e in 1982. Took about 20 minutes to calculate and construct a cycle chart.  Today it takes 3 seconds. And I screen 4437 stocks in 3 min.
2286 2018-03-31 15:03:28 Very simple strategy to follow: get ppl to believe AR15s are bad. Get them banned. If AR15s are bad, and they cause fewer deaths than handguns, handguns are also bad. Let’s ban handguns.
This is why so many 2A advocates refuse to budge on high capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc

2296 2018-03-31 14:53:06 Never invest with money you cannot afford to lose. When the market is down it is time to go bargain shopping for legend stocks.
2297 2018-03-31 14:50:47 Thing is with bump stocks, they look a) eminently 3D printable and therefore really hard to regulate out of existence anyway, and b) a bit silly and probably expensive in terms of wasted ammunition.

2300 2018-03-31 14:49:22 stock prices already have inflation factored in. for example if inflation rises & apple starts charging more for cell phone, apple will collect more money & hence increase its revenue as the stock adjust accordingly. So being in stocks (unlike gold) is actually an inflation hedge
2301 2018-03-31 14:49:15 Not really good enough if advertised deals aren’t available.  To be told no store stocks the product in the first place makes me wonder why they aren’t marked up accordingly i.e “Hurry for this deal that you can’t actually have” instead of “Hurry! Deal ends Tuesday”

2303 2018-03-31 14:45:49 Oops my bad

1. Good momentum stocks often have revenue growth rates north of 30%, 50%, or even 100% annually

2. Be on lookout for entry signal when 50-DMA crosses over the 200-DMA

3. If the stock falls 15% from your entry price, sell the stock immediately

2311 2018-03-31 14:42:21 It's a credible story, but it's just that Amazon also owns a cloud webhosting service, which numerous developers and companies use. This is like treating the company that stocks the CIA's vending machines as engaging in nefarious activities.

M16 or AK47 is an assualt weapon. Assualt weapons are fully automatic & before you say it bump stocks are illegal and only place you
2335 2018-03-31 14:22:20 It is not “Amazon” he’s attacking. It’s the ordinary Americans. Amazon is one of the greatest job creators in America. Every Amazon employee is is given 4 stocks each. So the president is not hurting Jeff Bezos. He’s hurting U and Me!

2357 2018-03-31 14:02:48 Bout to trade my mirrors for stocks
2358 2018-03-31 14:01:02 Remember back when you said stock owners should sue MSNBC for reporting fake news and causing stocks to drop. She seems to be squarely on the other foot now. Quit spouting off negative stuff about Amazon just to effect the stock value, it is illegal.
2359 2018-03-31 14:00:49 The only way to successfully do that is a legally-binding 180-day lock-up period. Ya know, public stocks.
2360 2018-03-31 13:59:08 I will not Invest, I will trade it on stocks, mainly penny stocks and high flyers and I will double that in short period of time...
2361 2018-03-31 13:58:53 Background checks exist. What good will a waiting period do? "High capacity magazines" make no difference to the lethality of a weapon. Bump stocks are stupid to begin with. And bans on certain types of guns exist.

Better be more specific.
2362 2018-03-31 13:56:40 This reply string is Un. Believable. Do you people really not get Grant’s point?!? This isn’t about stocks. A human died and Elon is on Mars with his insensitive tweets 
2363 2018-03-31 13:56:10 Pat Patriot represents being a Pats fan thru hard times. Flying Elvis represents the spolied rotten Pats fans who never went thru 1-15 & 2-14 seasons & have no clue whats it's like to be the doormat, laughing stocks of the league. They lack humbleness and at times is embarrassing
2364 2018-03-31 13:55:53 The grave danger is not outright repeal, it is a weakening by a thousand tiny concessions (bump stocks, magazine size, scarcity of rounds, and on and on). No compromise. No concessions. Not even one.
2365 2018-03-31 13:55:15 U mean ur paying high prices 4 stocks ur buying in the 401ks
The stock market has gone volititle 2 in last 2 months
The only thing propping up the Markets r the massive infusion of Corp employees 401ks & other plans
Or haven’t u noticed on Friday stocks go up & down on Monday
2366 2018-03-31 13:54:38 Autopilot is dead. Get back to driving your car. The fad was good and lot of folks and companies made good money on the fad. Time to fade these company stocks
2367 2018-03-31 13:52:36 SVU on IONDTV: 'Stocks & Bondage' - Benson and Stabler investigate a successful woman's suspicious death and find themselves in the world of sadomasochism.
2368 2018-03-31 13:50:17 If stocks and bonds are in a bubble and 20% of market values disappeared over night in a crash those numbers would go back towards the 2008 distribution.
2369 2018-03-31 13:49:40 U.K. Stocks deverstated this year can we stop fishing to save stocks for say a couple of years ?
2370 2018-03-31 13:48:42 It’s so annoying I can’t trade on stocks till Tuesday
2371 2018-03-31 13:48:09 yep. You cannot even pretend he wrote it to make the stock rise. Since they have no stocks.
2372 2018-03-31 13:47:59 Your not! It’s happening Obama hates this country! Obama is also working on a race war he is building up Black Panthers along with all the Muslims he’s bringing in! Obama has Muslim compounds all around the country with thousands of Muslims! That’s why he wanted the bump stocks!
2373 2018-03-31 13:47:26 I trust it stocks only healthy drinks & you can get a free leeching.
2374 2018-03-31 13:45:38 Will be tweeting today from Big Diamond Speedway, which hosts practice followed by features for vintage stocks and enduro cars. Action begins at 1 pm.
2375 2018-03-31 13:43:16 Hnd na ngayon. May stocks na kasi si @aurelio_solon hahaha
2376 2018-03-31 13:42:59 @foxandfriends If it had not been for the music, that scene in the Field of Dreams in the corn stocks could have been a horror movie!
2377 2018-03-31 13:42:18 Obama had a (D) senate and house for 4 years he could have passed any bill he wanted. Instead it was his admin that approved & passed the sale of bump stocks. Trumps admin will be the one to ban bumpstocks and actually take action. #staywoke
2378 2018-03-31 13:42:00 We have one of the largest stocks of Radio Mic Systems available anywhere in the UK. We also have a large stock of Beige Headsets and In Hair Mics available too. These are from well known manufacturers and are available not just to Hire but also to Purchase too!
2379 2018-03-31 13:41:50 Higher returns have come from lower-priced stocks. Last 20yrs:

High Prices
Vanguard 500 Index = +6.4%
Vanguard Total Int’l Index = +4.9%

Low Prices
DFA US Large Value = +7.5%
DFA US Small Value = +9.5%
DFA Int’l Value = +6.2%
DFA Int’l Small Value = +9.7%
2380 2018-03-31 13:40:58 Someone should create a Derivative that hedges exposure to the FANG stocks in your portfolio - call it De-FANG.
2381 2018-03-31 13:40:40 Bump stocks were banned in Florida.  Get your facts right
2382 2018-03-31 13:40:34 In his defense, he’s only worth $11 million. He’d have to sell stocks and really just mess up his portfolio defending himself. And the idea of writing a book, which he will do, that will make millions hasn’t crossed his mind. Resisters understand this.
2383 2018-03-31 13:39:50 I'm buying stocks in salt.
2384 2018-03-31 13:39:27 That's sad to know... The directive though mentions you have a month to dispose of your existing stocks...what exact business is your dad in ?
2385 2018-03-31 13:39:00 Are any of these companies privately owned? Let’s see how strong their conviction is when the stocks go down.
2386 2018-03-31 13:38:59 There was a"while stocks last" 75% off sale at Rosebank   I missed it
2387 2018-03-31 13:37:39 Tradition stocks at warhammer world? I know GW is doing good and everything but why not include NASDAQ too?
2388 2018-03-31 13:37:04 Like it or not, with an auction/bidding style environment, for goods that have only #subjective values, we are much closer to Art or other memorabilia #valuation than stocks or consumer products.  IE, nothing logical will reproduce what #blockchain #tokens are actually sold for.
2389 2018-03-31 13:35:37 Ted is right - those children being directed by the biased #AltLeft R soulless - it's very sad!

U can create as many laws U want banning guns, bullets, bump stocks, etc. but until laws R enforced bad ppl will still have them

#Fools #BS
#1A #2A will NEVER B repealed #TRUTH
2390 2018-03-31 13:35:10 Florida Rep. @VoteRandyFine is working on filing bills that repeal the firearm age raise to 21, waiting period, and ban of bump stocks in FL. #VoteHimOut #RandyFine @MomsDemand
2391 2018-03-31 13:34:39 Frustrating is an understatement! It’s Easter and you should have better stocks in place! Every store I’ve gone into (4 now) has loads of ordinary ones but not a freefrom one in site! You need to make more effort for people that have dietary requirements! Expect a complaint!
2392 2018-03-31 13:34:35 We love you all will be happy effective 4/9/18 But through it all Obama Administration legalized bump stocks with physical assault except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall Work will start immediately He was a great help JOBS
2393 2018-03-31 13:32:14 I've started using Yahoo Finance now. Another good one is StockRover, but TSX stocks don't get live updates starting recently
2394 2018-03-31 13:32:04 David you're gonna try to have a sensible conversation with folks who watched what happened in Vegas and still think bump stocks should be legal? Because taking them away starts us on the path to confiscation? Stay focused on elections. Take the NRA out of the equation.
2395 2018-03-31 13:29:13 I really hope someone is keeping an eye on what Trumps family, & buddies are doing with their stocks. Seems like there is serious insider trading happening right under our noses. They already busted the one friend of his when he announced the tariffs
2396 2018-03-31 13:29:05 @GeraldoRivera @PeteHegseth there are no  Palestinian only Jordanian who didn’t leave after Israel kick there butts in the 6 day war. Israel gave land back twice. But you want it all back. HISTORY
2397 2018-03-31 13:28:34 Whoever wrote the proposed bumpstock regulations failed basic physics.  Bump stocks require multiple activations of the trigger.  Bumpstocks change the frame of reference. Move finger on stationary rifle vs move rifle around stationary finger.  @NRA HELLO NRA??? @realDonaldTrump
2398 2018-03-31 13:26:54 Big supporters losing $ on FANG stocks won’t put up with this nonsense for long
2399 2018-03-31 13:26:17 Osige. Alam ko namang may stocks kayo sa company ng piattos eh
2400 2018-03-31 13:25:27 Also if ur a POS then ur a POS...u dont get a pass or make up for it because stocks r doing good, or u support a popular amendment, or some people like u... Attacking kids, or women, or being racist, makes u a POS, its not debatable
2401 2018-03-31 13:24:30 Where can I buy your phony stocks? How much time have you spent in prison?
2402 2018-03-31 13:22:57 gah my stocks are looking awful #dontlook #Patience
2403 2018-03-31 13:22:38 Correct. I was trying to determine if there was a floor, but only consistent marginal buyers (given a limited supply) could create a floor, which is not what hodlers are.

Explains why passive investing helps prop up stocks too.
2404 2018-03-31 13:21:56 Amazon, stocks in IoT
2405 2018-03-31 13:21:36 This company, $DIRV , is making big progress in 2018.
2406 2018-03-31 13:21:11 Good article. The last paragraph was particularly interesting. I think it could be summed up as were do you move your money to?? With no sector really showing a lot of promise. 
When stocks are overheated isn't F.I. supposed to be the safe heaven. Bwahaha.
2407 2018-03-31 13:20:51 All they want is sensible gun laws ban of bump stocks and AR-15 assault weapons is that to much to ask if it helps to save lives I’m proud that these teenagers are standing up to what they believe in it’s what Adults should’ve done long ago. Good Luck
2408 2018-03-31 13:20:04 WHAT is the Thank you for ?  Did you SHORT  @amazon ?  Did President short it ?? That is what I would like to know. It is NOT first time that he moved price of stocks.  Please Mr President  next time you want to bash a Corp. Let me know .Thanks @JeffBezos  I sold you at 7 dollars
2409 2018-03-31 13:18:02 Please write on NCLT stocks..with future..
2410 2018-03-31 13:17:32 I would pay off student loans, then put in stocks and the other in a savings account
2411 2018-03-31 13:17:23 I feel like tien can deal with stocks and bonds and he just doesn't know
2412 2018-03-31 13:17:02 I cant address bump stocks, I've never owned one and can't really make a call on that.

But u can say every week I'm at the range, and there are tons of people (high 100s if not 1000s) primarily with pistol grips and high cap mags. No one has gotten shot there yet. The pistol
2413 2018-03-31 13:16:05 No I know you’re not and appreciate it!! I agree with you and I invest in gold, silver stocks and crypto. Just trying to get both sides opinions on crypto.
2414 2018-03-31 13:15:22 How do I read and choose stocks?
2415 2018-03-31 13:14:41 And as far as bump stocks.. making them illegal does not keep criminals from getting them nor murdering.  Last time I checked murder was illegal and these criminals are still doing that. We have right to choose how to defend ourselves in a free country.
2416 2018-03-31 13:13:04 What are the best stocks or brokers to buy silver bro?
2417 2018-03-31 13:12:03 My dad knows I love goldfish so everytime I come home for the weekend he stocks the cabinet with golfish and it makes me very happy
2418 2018-03-31 13:11:50 give her stocks in tesla
2419 2018-03-31 13:11:27 Sir can u please elaborate on what basis the stocks are classified in segement A,B, X , XT. ? Also when these stocks move from their respective stages to more liquid segement like A or B . This would be very helpful for novices like us.
2420 2018-03-31 13:10:59 Same here! You too!
2421 2018-03-31 13:10:25 I am focused more on the "accessories" that can make all weapons more deadly in an active shooter situation: bump stocks, pistol grips, and high capacity magazines. Not so much on just the AR-15 itself.
2422 2018-03-31 13:09:42 Another fake slogan by the NRA:  “gun control is not about guns, it’s about power”.  Gun control is about guns.  It’s about banning bump stocks, imposing reasonable age limits, improving background checks, banning high capacity mags, and, yes, even banning the AR 15 kid killer .
2423 2018-03-31 13:09:35 Giving PoA to broker, allowing stocks to remain in pool account instead of moving to investor's demat account.... dangerous. Broker credibility is key. Traders going for low brokerage fraught with fraud!
2424 2018-03-31 13:09:08 do you support universal background checks Capt?    banning bump stocks?   banning large-capacity clips?   banning purchase for convicted domestic abusers and those on terrorist no-fly list?
2425 2018-03-31 13:08:46 OK, the nerves are kicking in. Its Play Off time, its @nucci39 time, @FifeFlyers this your moment, be proud, be pesky, believe and it will happen! #PeskyFlyers Go get em boys @C_Schaber @Stocks_68 @jisaacs5 @RBirzi @RussMoyer @PeteyL88 @A_Iles33
2426 2018-03-31 13:07:26 06 April new tax year starts. Party’s almost over for UK AIM’s Market Makers busy exploiting CGT tax loss sellers, sending downtrending stocks into extreme oversold territory. Chunk of sell pressure to disappear overnight.
2427 2018-03-31 13:07:03 It is possible this can go x10 over the years. It is hard to say which coins would go x10, It would be really easy than right. Besides I am well happy if an investment of mine profits 10 percent on a yearly base. That would be solid back in the days selling/buying stocks!
2428 2018-03-31 13:06:46 An amateur view: kalau kau ada duit lebih ribu raban yg kau plan takkan guna for upcoming 2 years, put it in Sapura Energy. I have a feeling the stocks will rise high next year.
2429 2018-03-31 13:04:05 It's time to tell everyone invested in this company to sell their stocks. I am putting that out all over. Sell HULU stocks & their parent company.
2430 2018-03-31 13:03:00 Opportunity cost matters. A car is a depreciating asset, and stocks appreciate over time. Better to be long stocks and short cars (lease) especially given the cost of lease financing is so low.
2431 2018-03-31 13:02:05 You can keep your guns. Why can’t we have universal background checks, waiting periods, red flag laws?  Bans on bump stocks and high capacity magazines?
2432 2018-03-31 13:00:13 Stocks on our List for 4 Days Last Week: $CROX $DYN $JOBS $MED $MULE $QDEL
2433 2018-03-31 12:58:22 From the block to the top Buddha baggies in his socks the only thing that changed now is we ain’t running out of stocks
2434 2018-03-31 12:57:41 Yes please so I can buy more stocks in ladder companies.
2435 2018-03-31 12:57:38 Of course a 401(k) is the standard non-liquid, low-maintenance solution for retirement savings. You can create a self-managed Roth IRA if you want to control which stocks you own and trade the account on your own.
2436 2018-03-31 12:57:12 I think a lot of the opposition to any form of extra gun control, comes from give us an inch and we will take a mile. Many who claim to want common sense gun control, really want to grab all the guns. I have no problem banning bump stocks. I can see no legitimate purpose (1)
2437 2018-03-31 12:57:07 Regardless if you are correct or wrong, do you have to tweet this?you can negotiate this and tweet the results,do you have to do more harm to there Stocks? and other companies stock may be affected !
2438 2018-03-31 12:54:42 The Publix by San Carlos and Summerlin Rd should have it. Also there is a little gas station near Bunche Beach that sometimes stocks Jai Alai. Total Wine will for sure have all of it.
2439 2018-03-31 12:53:24 I have nowhere left to shop or brand names to buy. I have been selling income stocks and today I have to find a replacement for the fancy feast I have fed my cats for 30 years.
Not seeing how my behavior has made any impact at all.
2440 2018-03-31 12:52:41 Why ban bump fire stocks when they've been used in a crime all of once, make the weapon actually LESS accurate and won't stop bad guys from getting them on the black market or make them themselves from scratch?
Why ban large cap mags when mags can be changed in mere seconds.
2441 2018-03-31 12:51:52 You might try reducing your reaction into political discussion, it never works out well for businesses. Just look at what is happened to others that decided to pull advertising based on politics. Their stocks went down just as yours will.
2442 2018-03-31 12:51:12 They want background checks, funding for research, waiting periods, red flag laws, bans on bump stocks and high capacity magazines. They want responsible consideration and debate for change. If you block that they believe you put your unfettered access of guns to all above lives.
2443 2018-03-31 12:45:50 They will probably enjoy the drops in their stocks. When will they learn to stay out of politics?
2444 2018-03-31 12:44:48 Ok let’s bring back hanging whilst we are on or is there a stocks where we can pillory him ffs calm down
2445 2018-03-31 12:43:22 Agreed global stocks are comfy/burdensome especially for wheat and beans.  Disagree that we are multiple years away from any supply concerns in corn.  Shrinking SA prod, generally strong demand.  Plug in a 165 to 168 yld
 and a 10% stks to use and sub 1.5 bill carryout plausible
2446 2018-03-31 12:43:14 When will honor view 10 be back in stocks why is it not available for so long in india?

2449 2018-03-31 12:38:56 But wait,Enoch you never had stocks.
2450 2018-03-31 12:35:42 They should really raise the age to buy a handgun in Chicago to 21, nay 22, to stop all this nonsense. And waiting period on bump stocks. Problem solved.  @instapundit @yesnicksearcy @DLoesch
2451 2018-03-31 12:35:36 Now I understand thanks for the clarification...I think his context was broader in terms of 99% of people don’t make money through stocks they retire broke...I believe he was evangelising crypto as an easier route that is not controlled by the elite IMHO
2452 2018-03-31 12:35:21 1,99 je risquais pas grand chose ;) les stocks et arrivages varient beaucoup d'un magasin à l'autre par contre
2453 2018-03-31 12:30:48 Watch their stocks is the Insiders pull out. Facebook, Amazon who's next?
2454 2018-03-31 12:30:09 Jumbo in Groningen, or so I was told. Don’t know your location but @galwaybeer is pretty well distributed in Holland these days. The beer store near where my dad lives also stocks it
2455 2018-03-31 12:29:12 @Emma4Change 
Yesterday Vermont, a hunting state with many gun owners, passed a new piece of legislation raising the purchase age to buy guns to 21, acquiring background checks for private sales and banning bump stocks. I thought you might enjoy knowing.
2456 2018-03-31 12:28:55 I was referring to @officialmcafee when he was chastising the crypto community for treating crypto tokens like stocks. Not you @marcorobinson7

2461 2018-03-31 12:17:47 I would invest 10k in commercial real estate and 10k in precious metals. 5k in bitcoin and 5k in stocks and bonds
2462 2018-03-31 12:16:44 I wish I was good at stocks
2463 2018-03-31 12:16:25 The imp is unaware that just like trading stocks in the NSE and NYSE, one can also trade in crypto- without being an "expert". I wonder where you found the word "expert" in my Bio.

I'm not surprised you don't know who uses & what they use Primavera P6 and MS Project for.
2464 2018-03-31 12:16:04 Tim Paine has called the boys together and told them, "Our batting stocks are a bit depleted but I still think we can make a hundred in our first innings."
2465 2018-03-31 12:15:39 I'm not counting the investments or stocks... lol
2466 2018-03-31 12:11:21 Stocks plunged as O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. unveiled a resentful sketch pad today.
2467 2018-03-31 12:10:33 I wonder if he can pick stocks to help us out?

2468 2018-03-31 12:10:14 Now serving: (while stocks last)
2469 2018-03-31 12:07:15 Nobody is trying to take away your guns. Wanting reasonable laws doesn't translate to gun confiscation. My family owns guns. We don't own bump stocks or AR-15's. Common sense laws aren't a round up.
2470 2018-03-31 12:06:25 I'm British. From my perspective, there's NO argument about assualt rifles, bump stocks or any other device that allows an individual to murder dozens in a matter of a few minutes. It's so obvious what the US must do.
2471 2018-03-31 12:03:20 @DarinNewsom why is there zero carry in the new crop beans and only a little in new crop corn when large stocks is all they want to talk about? I want to hedge on the Mar or Jul but there's no carry.
2472 2018-03-31 12:00:05 War with who? N.Korea meets with us in May. Stocks are up. People are making money. No healthcare penalty. Tax cuts. Don’t hear about ISIS anymore. But it’s the guns fault not the mentally ill, right? 
2473 2018-03-31 11:59:49 I voted Trump 2018, best vote lining time, stocks up,people working and best of all snowflakes are melting a vote well cast
2474 2018-03-31 11:59:21 Martha, I have traveled extensively around the world, & most recently in Italy, I had to apologize to citizens of Italy, Ireland, Scotland and Germany for the behavior of this" President". I assured them that I did not vote for him. We are laughing stocks in the word right now.
2475 2018-03-31 11:54:27 I'm not for playing wac-a-mole with the food chain so suppress some species to benefit commercial stocks
2476 2018-03-31 11:54:11 Oo pre lahat don inisa isa ko na. Wala talaga ubos na daw stocks
2477 2018-03-31 11:51:48 This silly response assumes I buy software and stocks.
2478 2018-03-31 11:51:12 Facts. We are 25x as likely to be killed by guns in the US than in peer nations. The NRA fights funding research on gun violence. A majority of Americans (and NRA members) want universal background checks, waiting periods, red flag laws, bans on bump stocks and high capacity ammo
2479 2018-03-31 11:48:13 Yeeees. UNB ALBUM magkaron ka na ng details maybe next week pag debut talaga. Looool. Laguta oi. Pag limited stocks baka di pa ko maka order.

2484 2018-03-31 11:44:19 It's a good thing European showed up and reduced the size for the cod stocks to a few percent of their original size and the proceeded to intensively fish everything else as well, I mean if we hadn't who knows in 10 or 20 thousand more years that seals might have beat us to it
2485 2018-03-31 11:43:56 Since super pricey yung Billy Taylor books sa amazon, I better wait for Thrift books and book depository to have their stocks.
2486 2018-03-31 11:43:11 Makawag gana ecoland gid promise hays yw way botique sa vans atay pd ning uban na mamugos na dari mi hays wala gid koy nabili kay diko feel mga stocks
2487 2018-03-31 11:41:35 You are doing nothing but pissing the Citizens WITH MONEY off!!! Keep up your Boycotting... Let’s see how the counter punch works out for these Companies!! Keep a close eye on the Stocks.... Keep up your Crusade that is way off course!!
2488 2018-03-31 11:40:31 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2489 2018-03-31 11:37:02 But is it like communism where prices are affordable and stocks are unavailable?
2490 2018-03-31 11:32:32 I look at #crypto like stocks. Bitcoin is King, but in the long run it does absolutely nothing. You use it to buy alts. Crap store of value because it's not physical. In long term alt coins will be king based on the tech behind it.
2491 2018-03-31 11:32:07 
It’s Easter!!! Free cream eggs on the bar and a FREE EASTER EGG for all kids that eat with us today and tomorrow (whilst stocks last). 
2492 2018-03-31 11:31:53 Politics needs spicing up eh ...bring back Stoning & the Stocks , introduce compulsory drug testing at Westmonster  and have parliament fitted with lie detectors that screech “oooh you Qunt” every time they detect a lie .......
2493 2018-03-31 11:31:52 In any event I look forward to many in the industry continuing to scapegoat seals, Europeans, the easter bunny and anything else that comes to mind for the sad state of NL fish stocks
2494 2018-03-31 11:30:00 How did u get into stocks n gaming...
2495 2018-03-31 11:29:39 If stocks open gap up or gap down 10-15% , then
2496 2018-03-31 11:29:05 I have no doubt most fishers have non desire to see any stocks collapse but the collective presume to maximize profits and harvest as much as possible combined with more effecient harvesting technology and a common resources mentality have been downfall, DFO made big mistakes too
2497 2018-03-31 11:29:01 #Facebook stocks plummeting. 

My thoughts: It's a good time to buy...
2498 2018-03-31 11:27:38 Was there anybody in the stocks and if so, did you wee on them? 
2499 2018-03-31 11:27:26 @JNJCares &johnson always trusted your product. With your boycott of Ingram's Angle you have demonstrated how wrong I have been. You Should have backed a winner with Laura Ingram. Will sell my stocks. Bye
2500 2018-03-31 11:27:18 So nice to see you all back and happy! Everyone need to stop giving these negative persons air time. We don’t care about Hillary or David Hogg or how terrible the protesters are. We want to hear about the good things our country is doing, low unemployment, stocks, the Wall!
2501 2018-03-31 11:24:57 May nakita ako sa NBS sa SMF na original book cover pa baka may stocks pa sila :))) pweds ko i-dm yung ebook file ko kung gusto mo :)
2502 2018-03-31 11:24:04 I hope $DB shares to go down by 20%. If so, I'd like to purchase the stocks.
2503 2018-03-31 11:23:40 Sorry to hear you're leaving, but great that you'll be working closer to home! Best of  luck with the new job :) x
2504 2018-03-31 11:22:18 Have you heard of Adelphia? Wasn't the business profitable? What happened to those who bought stocks? Find out!
2505 2018-03-31 11:21:38 I look for daily overextension and hyped volume. I don't like to see a lot of action in the previous days. I will in 95% place a trade right before the market closes, because I tracked over 300 stocks and I know my risk/reward management. I am swing trader.
2506 2018-03-31 11:19:07 Tant mieux pr la Chine et l Inde qui en ont fait des stocks et des stocks 
2507 2018-03-31 11:17:10 Those out of control seals must have really destroyed cod stocks in the 1300's with no seal hunt to keep their numbers in checks. *reads history book cod fish so plentiful they hauled them up in buckets in 1497*
2508 2018-03-31 11:15:18 #DearAmazon, I will gladly assist in your stocks and to combat the dumb trumpets boycott of you if you’d just stop giving the NRA a platform. Right now you can’t have it both ways on social issues. Figure it out. Please @JeffBezos
2509 2018-03-31 11:14:49 est-ce que t’a des stocks de sauce pomme frites wayye ?
2510 2018-03-31 11:14:03 2 ways. 1st is new trend, zero brokerage givers keep shares in pool account instead of sending to demat account. In & out while purchase & sell comes at costs so it saves your money. People agree on keeping stocks in pool. 2nd forever evil, Power of attorney.
2511 2018-03-31 11:13:56 Uiteraard lost dat de files niet op, wie dat gedacht heeft was naïef : zolang minimale stocks, “just in time delivery”, productie verplaatsen naar lage loonlanden, enz... de regel blijven, zullen er steeds meer vrachtwagens bij komen.  De nood blijft en de kost wordt doorgerekend
2512 2018-03-31 11:12:04 Not algorithms, but a definitive analysis of stocks where each stock is ranked based on our criteria. 

We wanted this to automated unfortunately we are facing hiccups. We are now using excel macros with nse live data feed. 

We are using standard deviation as of now.
2513 2018-03-31 11:09:35 Cash is King in 2018 

(and bonds are outperforming stocks)

Total Returns YTD:
Cash: .3%
Commodities: -.7% 
US Bonds: -1.2%
US Equities: -1.6%
2514 2018-03-31 11:08:48 No one wants to do away with the 2nd amendment, but letting the public run around with rifles that will blow up a human like an a bomb and modifying guns with bump stocks is totally wrong.  Use some common sense!
2515 2018-03-31 11:05:56 Penny stocks are EXTREMELY risky.  Avoid them.
2516 2018-03-31 11:01:24 Single person households or a basket of undervalued NCAV stocks. Latter is probably much easier
2517 2018-03-31 11:01:19 She has, I am persuaded, a great deal. She had given Davy Cuninghame some shirts and stocks and stockings; and this morning told me she had got £50 from her husband to give him.

2526 2018-03-31 10:51:34 Yeah may mga ganun dun. I bought this January pa so di ko na alam mga stocks nila ngayon.
2527 2018-03-31 10:51:04 I think the point regarding considering the cost (if any) added by the adviser/planner to manage passives is one many overlook.

Irrespective or active/passive, total cost to invest is a key figure.
2528 2018-03-31 10:50:06 Not a smart move on his part, it's only Bump Stocks, doesn't cover any other modifications...
But it's like giving peanuts to peasants, they'll enjoy it! and it doesn't take much effort or expense to do.
2529 2018-03-31 10:48:49 And it's INFY... There are still many listed stocks including Wipro which are still below 2000 highs...
2530 2018-03-31 10:48:30 Gardons une possibilité d’adaptation : fixer arbitrairement un nombre d’heures, surtout si bas, est dangereux... les PME n’ont pas toutes les mêmes problématiques : pensons aux stocks notamment...
2531 2018-03-31 10:47:14 It’s up there with Davro in the stocks.
2532 2018-03-31 10:45:14 Waise it's true that a discount broker called F6 Online/F6 Finserve has run away with money and also sold all the stocks in pool account at whatever price they got and vanished. Many lost money and life time savings in stocks because of Zero brokerage they were giving.
2533 2018-03-31 10:43:01 Couldn’t agree more, and timing.  A lot of my stocks started in the early/ recovery folio.  ZTF at 67p and CSSG at 18p.

2542 2018-03-31 10:36:30 It's a great article that we're all so interested in stocks?
2543 2018-03-31 10:33:59 I’m only marginally + YTD (+1.7%) but this market has felt like crawling through a minefield with a v heavy load. What’s notable is how few stocks meaningfully contributed to my performance..this is why I’m pruning down to best ideas only for Q2 ..I’ll need to be lucky though 
2544 2018-03-31 10:32:55 AND they sell A LOT of INFERIOR products that are made in China! I return so much..Shall I sell those stocks? Lol
2545 2018-03-31 10:32:16 Maximum positions means how many #stocks do have at maximum in your portfolio. 15 stocks with 10% position size = 150% capital. That would be 50% on margin and means higher volatility of your equity curve.
2546 2018-03-31 10:30:40 You can define that you are only #trading #stocks if the S&P 500 20 MA is above the 50 MA and shows a clear trend. That’s an example for a market situation rule.

2551 2018-03-31 10:24:49 We have many patients in NYC jail on bupe (~150). Some enter on tx; others we initiate. Upon release, we can provide 4 days Bupe in hand + F/U appt, but I often send bridge eRx as well. Many pts already know community pharmacy that stocks Bupe, but our new pts often do not.
2552 2018-03-31 10:24:47 @Darty_Officiel pas cool de faire ça à Tonio. Normalement tu lui files le lave vaisselle à 40e plus cher mais sans qu'il paye les 40e parce que c'est de ta faute si tu gères mal tes stocks. C'est comme ça qu'une entreprise qui vante sans cesse son SAV ferait en tout cas...

2573 2018-03-31 09:42:26 Hi Lianne, they will all be disappearing very soon. It might be best to chat with your Consultant to see how long their stocks are predicted to last so that you don't miss out. Best wishes, SW x

2581 2018-03-31 09:24:31 Please advise which point is unfair. I'm always open to challenge as my aim is to provide people with truths about money - to help them make better choices.
2582 2018-03-31 09:23:21 Grabe when will someone thank me for giving them stocks for their skin care routine?
2583 2018-03-31 09:22:22 So stocks and bonds lost money in Q1. But that’s at an asset level. I have a list of 20 or so large cap US names, with an average yield ~US 10s, that are up 12% on average ytd. 

Yes value suffers large periods of underperformance, but active managers are still generating returns

2586 2018-03-31 09:09:46 Of course they must must be punished first, bank authorities r always equal partner of all activities making fack documents, nd valuation, approval of loan, etc, it's a big crime to issue billions of rupees to disqualified persons
2587 2018-03-31 09:08:34 Its not just me that is dropping it. We just usually quietly go away and stop purchasing. It is stupid for a business to alienate millions of people. Ask Dick's. Their stocks dropped &they missed their sales projections even though other retailers are increasing.
2588 2018-03-31 09:08:17 Education is a key!.. the reason I say appearance is the things that make an AR-15 the same as the M-16 is appearance.. barrel shrouds, flash suppressors, collapsible stocks, bayonet lug, pistol grip...
2589 2018-03-31 09:06:38 Monday should be exciting. Not many penny stocks can claim to have financials as good as OCSY. Too bad  investors prefer hype to decent financials. Oh well, they will chase this stock someday.
2590 2018-03-31 09:05:56 I am a 2nd A advocate, BUT, what in the heck is wrong with raising the age to 21 to buy a rifle, banning bump stocks, and waiting 3 days to purchase a weapon?  This should be in every state.
2591 2018-03-31 09:05:08 @Tesco If I tell you my postcode, could you tell me the nearest store that stocks a certain product? thanks :)
2592 2018-03-31 09:03:48 I timed someone out (sonic) for the first time today.

2593 2018-03-31 09:01:59 So when stock market dropped in 2008 for example, it was a bad time to buy stocks?
2594 2018-03-31 09:01:57 Wet n Wild new stocks now available !!
2595 2018-03-31 09:01:28 And should never have invested in stocks (the same market), again to recoup money?

2618 2018-03-31 08:39:50 Please remember that bump stocks do not change the function of the gun in any way, they do not make it full auto. The ATF twice ruled as such. They simply use energy from the discharged round to "bounce" the trigger back into your trigger finger. It still requires 1 pull per shot

2620 2018-03-31 08:38:13 They are asking that state lawmakers ban the sales of assault rifles, bump stocks and high capacity ammo magazines, raise the purchase age to 21 & universal background checks for all gun purchases & it's working Vermont just signed all into law!

2624 2018-03-31 08:32:20 I didn't say it was good to watch the hunt. I know it seems cruel, I'm a lifelong vegetarian, but the whale stocks are sustainable and carefully monitored. No slaughter is pleasant but most eat meat and fish
2625 2018-03-31 08:32:15 I would invest it in the stocks of a very successful company because that way the chances of me meeting a loss will be very low
2626 2018-03-31 08:30:40 the "Enumerated Powers" those that set Limits on the power of Government have NO such power to Legislate Guns, AMMO, or Bump stocks, and ALL of them infringe on OUR rights to own weapons of choice....not governments choice, the bump stock ban should be repealed
2627 2018-03-31 08:27:45 General Electric Co., once the world’s largest company by market value, is now smaller than all of the #FANG stocks. GE fell below the least valuable of the four, Netflix Inc., four weeks ago.
2628 2018-03-31 08:24:49 No bump stocks.

No expanded magazines. 

No semi-automatic rifles. (Since you insist on the semantics re “automatic”)

Background checks on ALL gun purchases. No exceptions. 

Age limit for purchases. 

Allow research on gun violence.
2629 2018-03-31 08:24:06 Bump stocks are pretty useless without a rifle to attach it to. They are fun to shoot with though, gets a little expensive being that the rifle pops out ammo like falling rain. Semi-autos are most all guns these days. Be they hand or rifle.
2630 2018-03-31 08:23:25 I would put some into certain stocks and bonds, some into start up companies, and some into entertainment (MLB, NFL, NBA)

2633 2018-03-31 08:19:28 Yeah, we will end up agreeing to disagree.I have no problem with gun show background checks.. I haven't been to a gun show that doesn't have them but I hear they are out there. I also have no problems banning bump stocks.Bumpstocks are totally worthless for anything but ripidfire

2670 2018-03-31 07:36:05 Judging by our B's efforts i think our stocks are low. Maybe play him in the forward pocket, sneak a few goals or pozis, get him using the ball effectively? Confidence will make him.
2671 2018-03-31 07:33:40 A good portfolio is more than a long list of good stocks and bonds. It is a balanced whole, providing the investor with protections and opportunities with respect to a wide range of contingencies. #SaturdayMotivation @NSEIndia
2672 2018-03-31 07:33:27 Im not doubting the kid, but your description doesnt warrant A grade game time. Particularly after last week. Unless our stocks are that low the we dont have a choice?

an arsenal of bullets. Lives
are more than guns.

2692 2018-03-31 07:09:44 I’m with Tripp on this one. Plus, no rent or mortgage REALLY makes it easy to pay bills and start putting money in savings then CDs then Stocks and bonds. Though, I’d suggest a house around 300k and paying off debt and trying to have at least 100k in the bank.
2693 2018-03-31 07:09:34 Agreed but Pakistan and Pakistanis should remain sovereign. China should respect this as a friend. Pakistan and Pakistanis wants real economic growth, not just circulation of Chinese money into our stocks, money and property markets; no artificial bubble. We want leadership role

2700 2018-03-31 07:03:34 Cell phones: Tools of communication or toys of distraction? Like stocks and bonds, depends how you use them to define capitalism versus decapitalism. Using phone to dumb down oneself is akin to mental decapitation or mental chains of self-enslavement.
2701 2018-03-31 07:01:57 This! @DLoesch @shannonrwatts . Background checks? Bump stocks? Q: Does having laws against drunk driving, stop drunk drivers? No? Why have the law? 
Q: Does having more cars on the road increase the likelihood of an accident? Yes? Why do you think more guns wld do the opposite?
2702 2018-03-31 06:59:50 Fuck the #NRA.  Why do you need a rifle for self defense? Lets get this straight, I do not want to take away hunting rifles or handguns.  I want military grade rifles semi-auto or auto-fire, I want bump stocks gone, and better background checks, so that its harder to get a (1/2)

They were approved under Obama by His ATF after review. No Lobbying or influence of any kind.
Just one more Anti-gun LIE being spread about the NRA..........
2709 2018-03-31 06:53:56 Let them go. Take your money out of the stocks. Watch them fall Monday morning.

2715 2018-03-31 06:42:19 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

2718 2018-03-31 06:38:46 @realDonaldTrump please do not allow the banning of bump stocks. Can we try to enforce the laws we have first?
2719 2018-03-31 06:35:03 That’s an interesting perspective. People moving out of gold to stocks in cities like Chennai.
2720 2018-03-31 06:32:50 Again another liberal who does not know their weapons. Now i do agree that bump stocks need to go. No use for them. Longer waiting periods, Yes. Raising the age limit, No. Stronger back ground checks, Yes. But states also need to do a better job flagging ppl.

2728 2018-03-31 06:19:03 This is such nonsense. I bought a vu TV from Flipkart instead of this one - and the installation guy himself offered to sell me an mi TV then and there and also CONFIRMED that the stocks were being sold to third party sellers from Flipkart's own warehouse. Beat that.

2730 2018-03-31 06:12:28 Paying taxes on a few tax bid house so i can collect some property in a years time and investing in stocks and create a few passive incomes for myself so it becomes a profit
2731 2018-03-31 06:12:21 coin of 2 sides.
i do feel more comfortable with stocks than with no position bias . it is a bias with no position as well.
2732 2018-03-31 06:11:40 I believe both $DAX & $SPX with $DJI are in a topping process, this could last months, so get used to big moves in both directions,

I figure $USD will GO STRONG soon, A heavy $USD hurts stocks and indices..

Figure 89.75 rise to 95 $USD
50 points on $DJI for each 0.15
$DJI -1700

2735 2018-03-31 06:05:14 I suspect that it will send #Vanadium stocks on #ASX even higher than they have gone in the last 2 weeks !
2736 2018-03-31 06:04:50 @GeekandSundry @executivegoth @Marisha_Ray My first Shakespeare and play was also A Midsummer Night’s Dream. It made me fall in love with theater in general while I was in 4th grade. I read it at least twice over that school year. Thank you for #GatherYourShakespeare
2737 2018-03-31 06:03:39 No, it points out that focusing on the instrument of death without addressing 'why' someone would feel it is ok to kill others, you won't stop the killings.  I am for sensible background checks, 5 day waiting period, banning illegal bump-stocks, etc. Key is sensible.
2738 2018-03-31 06:02:41 It all is about distraction. The lower the price for gold, silver...BTC falls the less common people want to buy it. That is why the criminal banks smash and cintrol the price of these assets. Instead, they want people to buy their overvalued stocks and bonds.
2739 2018-03-31 06:00:20 Fair point, I personally think capacity to kill does matter, and what’s available now is well beyond self protection, but I also understand argument that where there’s a will there’s a way. So how do we minimize the way? Bump stocks and capacity are a start
2740 2018-03-31 05:59:56 Time is friend of good stocks and enemy of bad stocks !!
So price wont matter much if you know the value, and go for value if your holding period is longer.

2747 2018-03-31 05:48:59 High capacity magazine, pistol grip, and bump stocks on AR-15 not an issue after what we saw in Las Vegas last year? 58 people dead and hundreds wounded. That's nearly 20 (!) times more deadly than the Boston Marathon *bombing*. And bombs are illegal, AR-15 is not.
2748 2018-03-31 05:48:07 Best thing to happen to the gun industry since Sam Colt. I sure hope @davidhogg111, @Emma4Change and @KamalaHarris keep up the attack. My gun stocks are soaring.
2749 2018-03-31 05:46:17 I guess you are not aware about good mutual funds. I have doubled my money few times with mutual fund. I use mutual funds when I don’t have time to analyse stocks and my money is sitting around doing nothing. Well mutual fund don’t suck TBH!! 
2750 2018-03-31 05:46:01 Lots of tutorials on the internet too if you wanna learn how to use masks and overlays/stocks to make it look cooler. Having three players in one pic looks a little overcrowded tho so it’s hard to make that work. Try having one focal point to start then having a bg and a fg.
2751 2018-03-31 05:45:08 @groom_media @innocpics0 @FXS_Stocks_PT - Hi! Happy to have you in my community :)
2752 2018-03-31 05:44:52 The offer lasts until the stocks lasts with the seller, this has to be checked out as soon as the product is added to cart. Request your understanding.
2753 2018-03-31 05:42:24 Business-iticians don't care about citizens... they crave stocks, wealth, and real estate empires... hence deregulations, unaffordable health care, Soc Sec cuts, and eliminated tax deductions disguised as tax cuts...the low income and middle class' loss is their gain.

2759 2018-03-31 05:35:09 You on the other hand buy it all hook line and sinker. Have you ever been in business where the board members and the stock holders will not let you miss your quarter’s forecast cause they want to sell stocks? The company & employees would do better but they don’t give a #^*.
2760 2018-03-31 05:33:01 Just make sure to get stocks with the combos, which you do a lot, I just got fortunate & lived long enough to kill you first. Don’t feel like your combo game is hurting you, you’ve got a lot of good setups that I can tell you’ve worked on. You’ll get me next time I’m sure lol
2761 2018-03-31 05:31:52 Maybe you should tell everyone who allowed bump stocks to be manufactured and sold in the US. Actually, he signed off on it. Who was it? #thanksobama Obama wanted everyone dead. That's why he did nothing when black people were being killed nearly every day by police! #Ferguson
2762 2018-03-31 05:31:50 If you think a big Tax cut will pay for Infrastructure spending you’re delusional. What it will do is buy back stocks and keep middle class wages stagnant. The GoP tax cuts were aimed to help the 1%.

2769 2018-03-31 05:18:50 Is that a 101 on trolling #shitcoins? Cause if it is, is a good one! Reminds me of the eternal "form follow function"..function is the same (trolling for profit) only form is different (crypto instead of stocks).In nature life trolls by using colours to reproduce.

2781 2018-03-31 05:05:44 Ok. But last question. What did YOU get out of the Trump tax plan? All I see is the stock market crashing. It's been good for folks like me since I can buy back stocks reduce my debt to earnings ratios & improve liquidity of owned assets. I think people on salaries were suckered.

2787 2018-03-31 05:01:09 Yeah. He shud be shooting the hoops like Obama did. What was sickening was the BHO line, 'hope & change'. Now he's gone & unemployment is down, stocks up, welfare roles down, consumer confidence up, taxes lowered for most unless you live in a blue state. Yep it's making BHO sick.

2793 2018-03-31 04:49:05 Robinhood, double it with margin by paying $10 Robinhood gold monthly fee and each day buy and sell the highest earning dividend stocks prior to ex-dividend and sell on ex-dividend. Of course I would choose those stocks wisely and wait for them to recover in price to break even.

2802 2018-03-31 04:34:32 Hi All,
Do you agree the lot size for SME stocks are far too high. When mainline cos trade at much lower sizing, why these ones sold in lots of 1k. Is this meant for big investors as small retail cannot deploy so much cash at once.Your thoughts,I think sizing should be small

2805 2018-03-31 04:31:39 We're talking about background checks, waiting periods and bans on high capacity magazines, bump stocks and certain types of guns. 

Trump himself said he wanted to take your guns.

2810 2018-03-31 04:28:38 I believe several actions need to be taken to minimize attacks. Easier access to mental health services is greatly needed. Better psychological services in schools. Parent/guardian accountability. AR-15s and bump stocks should  be illegal.
2811 2018-03-31 04:27:41 Time to buy some FB stocks then. Thanks for the tip
2812 2018-03-31 04:27:40 I’m okay with the ban on bump stocks. Raising the age to 21 is absurd. You’re okay with an 18-20 year old defending your right to free speech by carrying a weapon, but don’t trust them to purchase one by themselves? (1/2)

2850 2018-03-31 03:49:32 The government is already trying to make bump stocks illegal, and high capacity mags are also very hard to get a hold of
2851 2018-03-31 03:48:20 TR beats SH making us 33-7 good job boys shout outs to @iPokelam for taking 6 stocks and getting mvp
2852 2018-03-31 03:44:56 THAT IS ACTUALLY A JOKE LMAO like if there is a good ship, say, if i get interested in markmin, i’ll say ‘I’M BUYING THEIR STOCKS’ instead of ‘I’m starting to ship them’?
2853 2018-03-31 03:42:34 There a lot of things going on right now in Congress and the White House. Age restrictions, enhanced background checks, looking into making schools a hard target. Trump has signed an executive order to ban the sale of bump stocks. And more...

2855 2018-03-31 03:40:44 Reasonable like restrict sales to military age young adults? Ban 'assault weapons' for their 2% involvement? Ban bump stocks for their...not 1% but 1 use? And the fav discussion now, eliminate the 2nd Amd? How about we eliminate target rich 'no gun' shooting galleries?

2872 2018-03-31 03:25:56 No one wants removal of 2nd Amendment!  What is wanted is stricter background checks, longer waiting periods, raising age for gun purchases, no bump stocks, & removing military weapons from the hands of civilians.  Hunters, ranchers, sportsman keep handguns, rifles, shotguns.

But he doesn’t believe these measures will prevent school shootings.”

2925 2018-03-31 02:36:21 TBH theres been shit like tac-triggers etc. for years b4 bump stocks that did the same shit, I believe vegas was the first mass shooting involving this type of device, they really aren't even practical, except just for fun , but remember give 'em an inch and they will take a mile
2926 2018-03-31 02:36:09 No. For God's sake, no. We don't want your hand guns or rifles. Hunt away. Protect your home and family. Just stop making semi automatic weapons available. Raise the age and increase background checks. Bam bump stocks. Low cap. magazines. thanks
2927 2018-03-31 02:36:04 These leftists were openly conspiring on Twitter to first go for bump stocks to open the door, then eventually move to either complete AR-15 bans or regulate more heavily than machine guns. Others more open that the ultimate goal is banning all guns, but incrementally was the way
2928 2018-03-31 02:34:21 Can I get that follow back tho? And I remember you in usk stocks's streams
2929 2018-03-31 02:32:13 With bump stocks that jack up accuracy?  You talk in circles. Unfollowing...
2930 2018-03-31 02:32:07 Don't ban bumper stocks.Put 2A where it was intended by our forefathers. A citizen army based on a individual who is trained an not under a governor or other command structure. Have manuals made an all citizens tested when passed mandatory carry!
2931 2018-03-31 02:29:04 Any that can, by themselves or with little modification, kill 10 or 30 people in minutes. And it’s not just the guns. It’s high-capacity mags, bump stocks, and other idiotically legal items that turn an already dangerous weapon into a military-level killing machine.
2932 2018-03-31 02:28:57 Bulid a diversified stock portfolio with blue chip stocks  and high dividends paying stocks. Then a case of cold ones
2933 2018-03-31 02:26:58 If banned, SAR (R = rifles) can not legally be bought, sold, or even B in your possession: AR15s & AK47s need 2B taken off the streets (along with large-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc). 

Uh, & no one said anything about banning hand-guns: their lethality is nowhere close.
2934 2018-03-31 02:20:18 Right we should focus on data that shows +90% of USA support #GunControl

Specifically:

+90% want Universal Background Checks, close gun show & private sales/inheritance loopholes & ban bump stocks

+75% support #BanAssultWeapons

There’s no debate We are the majority
2935 2018-03-31 02:19:01 I support Mom's Demand. Gun owner and CC in NY. I'm for sensible gun regulations: background checks; no gun show or private sales; waiting periods; ban high capacity mags, bump stocks, assault weapons; permits for handguns, 5 round max rifle mag, mandatory training, natl registry
2936 2018-03-31 02:17:10 We maybe a bit early but definitely better than late. Hedge funds don't dump stocks at every little move up and down when they have multi year potential in mind. Cryptos are no different as far as the big three are concerned.
2937 2018-03-31 02:16:57 They won't be cancelled. Most likely they'll become exclusive to another store or the stocks will be sold to a store like Ollie's or Big Lots.

2943 2018-03-31 02:08:36 Currently: still have a little money in bitcoin-looking to sell soon bc that shits dropping and sold all my stocks in February bc all of them were dropping and have dropped
2944 2018-03-31 02:07:36 @DLoesch I’m honestly curious about this. Has the NRA ever done a survey or research to find out how members feel about stricter background checks, longer waiting periods, raising the age someone can buy a gun, ban of bump stocks and any other relevant issues?

2948 2018-03-31 02:04:27 what stocks whos your broker??
how many brokerage firms you work with
2949 2018-03-31 02:00:33 Bcoz Govt had secret, Coke secret is just brilliant marketing.
2950 2018-03-31 01:59:32 Abortion or not, not my business. I don’t think our society needs AR or Bump stocks, but the right to own guns yes. Few things need to change. Either way, your comparison is apple and oranges.
2951 2018-03-31 01:57:15 Of course. Because its great for his campaign fund that he stocks and never has to use
2952 2018-03-31 01:54:22 Did you know you can use the dollar sign to tag securities such as stocks and cryptos just like in stocktwits. Examples $ETHUSD $amzn $SPY

2955 2018-03-31 01:45:05 Amendments can be changed that's what an amendment means! Still using fear to sell guns to kill more kids!

2956 2018-03-31 01:44:58 I think this applies for newbies tho. I heard that the longer the artist stays in the company, the bigger the share they get and they also get a portion of sm stocks. Imagine, if this was the case for all artist then why the hell did artist like boa or kanta chose to renew their
2957 2018-03-31 01:43:06 As that liquidity leaves and traditional asset prices come down, there are less people searching for new opportunities and thus look to stocks and bonds as having strong potential return again.

2959 2018-03-31 01:40:37 I'd rock the time machine.
Play the stocks early, fuel into a safe foreign account in a future name then cash out when I return.
2960 2018-03-31 01:39:09 Myself man. I'd take a week cruise, hit up @TurningStone with a little. And use the rest to support myself so I can finish up my CPA. Any leftover after I pass and get a new job probably goes to stocks, I have a couple I'm liking right now. Depends what's left.
2961 2018-03-31 01:39:00 Bump stocks should be illegal, hence why Trump has been on board since Vegas.
2962 2018-03-31 01:38:59 Your lack of intelligence is showing. Assault weapons are banned and have been for many years. You don’t even know what an assault weapon is do you? As far as bump stocks go I have no problem getting rid of those. They’re worthless anyways. But please go in and tell me more.
2963 2018-03-31 01:38:15 Outrage is the currency, identifying micro-aggressions is the penny-stocks of the modern left.

2969 2018-03-31 01:35:19 No, repeal NFA so there are no restrictions, therefore no need of bump stocks.
2970 2018-03-31 01:34:04 If bump stocks are to approximate the firing rate of machine guns how is that “problem” solved if a person can just get an actual machine gun? Maybe I’m misunderstanding... We will stop people from having machine gun-like fire power by giving them machine guns?
2971 2018-03-31 01:33:56 Now how about some love for Tesla? The company (and my stocks) are getting battered... It'd be foolish to sell low but then....????

2973 2018-03-31 01:28:08 Actually it’s now 1/3 but you are right, most gun owners favor more restrictions. The gun owners I’ve talked to have no problem with universal background checks, longer waiting periods, banning bump stocks, and many don’t think citizens should have semi-automatic weapons.

2976 2018-03-31 01:21:02 Because of liberal media outlets. Do they mention low unemployment, stocks highest, NK talks going well, Isis defeated 98% , crime down, war on opioids, shoot today I saw CDC says Aids can be eradicated in 19 years! all while being blasted on a daily basis? Educate them
2977 2018-03-31 01:16:53 It looks like the next step is put the three cricketers in stocks at Martin Place, and let the public throw rotten fruit at them. It might be the only way to appease the overreaction. #auspol #balltampering

2979 2018-03-31 01:16:32 @TedNugent Why do you spew such hate towards these young people from Parkland.  They are also not trying to take guns and rifles away from anyone.  Just assault weapons and bump stocks.  The NRA provide weapons to our enemies of State they do have blood on their hands.2/3
2980 2018-03-31 01:14:34 Because they are so much against sensible gun laws. Like banning the stocks. For the record I am against them as an organization not members per say. Sadly they, like many large companies, are just more concerned with a profit than anything else.
2981 2018-03-31 01:13:54 Well then I would say that, as far as bump stocks, it is of neutral effect.
2982 2018-03-31 01:13:50 You will be better served with your own watching stocks chart.

2989 2018-03-31 01:08:13 Let me see if I understand first: he’s saying people use bump stocks because they can’t buy machine guns, so allowing them to buy machine guns will make bump stocks unnecessary... is that right?
2990 2018-03-31 01:05:52 Anyone know any good books on swing trading stocks and futures?
2991 2018-03-31 01:03:44 I totally agree but don't believe it will happen - certainly not now. If we could get rid of the 'mass shooter' guns and 'bump stocks', that would save a LOT of lives! That would be a wonderful first start but Lauren - what Australia did was better.

2995 2018-03-31 00:56:39 Here you are again proving my point. I didn’t say anything about disarming you and it’s the first thing you go to. You never hear one of you arguing against assault weapons bans or bump stocks or background checks. You just go right to this cause it gets you all hard.
2996 2018-03-31 00:56:06 my current strategy for the backward looking data is to do the opposite. when data shows they reduced B/S, that likely resulted in lower stocks. Based on the chart, after reducing, they increase (2 steps forward 1 step back), so when i see reduction in data, tells me to buy ST

3000 2018-03-31 00:50:52 @TuckerCarlson Liberals can & will ban guns if they gain power. When Trump used executive power to ban bump stocks it set a precedent for future presidents to ban a class of ammo or guns.
3001 2018-03-31 00:49:09 First they worked around the Constitution, now they work around Congress. Which bill males bump stocks illegal? Who wrote it or voted for it? We are being ruled by fiat. I am afraid the last peaceful resolution to DC’s tyranny is an #ArticleV #COS. Your thoughts?
3002 2018-03-31 00:48:40 Buy stocks of gun manufacturers, definitely going up, again
3003 2018-03-31 00:48:18 If you notice the stocks he sold way too prematurely, that same terminal value is probably the root cause of it (eg amazon, Microsoft etc)
3004 2018-03-31 00:47:00 Let it ride on a couple stocks and buy on margin!!!!! No guts. No glory. And no incomprehensible Duke Brothers losses.

3008 2018-03-31 00:45:05 Being armed is the only way to protect? There’s also keeping guns out of unsafe hands, banning bump stocks and assault weapons.

3010 2018-03-31 00:43:18 Dozens of semi-auto rifles, suppressors, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines? Sounds like there would be more people involved down the line... Dozens?

3014 2018-03-31 00:40:57 The only reason bump stocks even exist is because of prior infringement of our 2nd Amendment rights. Legalizing machine guns by abolishing the NFA would solve the bump stock problem. #2A

3017 2018-03-31 00:39:18 @RFGent1 but Lord O passed legislation to allow sales of bump stocks. 58 people were shredded in Vegas because of this so don’t act like that chump did so much for gun reform. And to put it in @davidhogg111 mentality-Obama has blood on his hands for the bump stocks used in Vegas.
3018 2018-03-31 00:37:57 Too much inflation might be an issue; that’s true. But over the past decade, the problem has been the opposite - too little inflation. We’ve lots of tools to reduce inflation - like taxes. Moreover, why would stocks sell off if people knew interest rates would stay low?

3022 2018-03-31 00:34:47 Oh I know plenty about bump stocks. Was gonna get one but didn't see the purpose. Wastes too much ammo with no accuracy. These kids are too impressionable and have been brainwashed throughout their whole time in the school system. Kinda sad that most can't think for themselves.

3025 2018-03-31 00:31:10 Please Mr. President, don’t cave to the liberal left on any issue relating to our gun rights. Only one crime has ever been committed with a legally owned machine gun yet they’re banned. Same with bumpfire stocks...ONE. Why ban them? It’s knee jerk, feel good, crap for the left...
3026 2018-03-31 00:30:49 I guess you're too stupid to research, but Obama allowed bump stocks!
3027 2018-03-31 00:30:47 "Don't dump and run"

3043 2018-03-31 00:13:55 No they don't, but they do back an organization that donates $millions$ to the GOP, so they turn a blind eye to any kind of middle ground on stricter background checks, banning bump stocks and stopping people with mental illness from getting guns.
3044 2018-03-31 00:13:14 Should feel lucky that they are planning to file it. Don't forget we are trading OTC stocks. Also not surprised they don't file on time, when they just recently switched back the accounting firm.

3107 2018-03-30 23:38:22 Our constitution was written to protect citizens from the gov. “Militia” means any able body not military. Bump stocks have been banned by our President. As for “assault” weapons the term “assault weapon” “Military Style” is a scare tactic the dems like to use as fear mongering .

3110 2018-03-30 23:36:26 Part 3 every editorial dealing with Manchester should start with an apology about how Union Leader screwed over Manchester's taxpayers along with the government officials who pushed for taxpayer dollars to pay for it instead of stocks and bonds in an arena corporation
3111 2018-03-30 23:34:35 crypto moves much faster on that chart than traditional stocks do. Could easily be in the depression stage

3113 2018-03-30 23:32:12 Yes Anythg tt fires rapidly and includes bump stocks   Military people do not agree with regular people getting. Parkland Cruz was taught by NRA to fire tt gun he used. He went out and bought one.
3114 2018-03-30 23:30:29 RW: Technology stocks have stumbled lately, but Cisco Systems pays a solid dividend and seems strong within a struggling sector.
3115 2018-03-30 23:29:59 The take 5 miles on bump stocks rhetoric..
3116 2018-03-30 23:29:33 Is your constitution is specific around assault rifles / bump stocks etc... 

This is about common sense and making changes to reduce further deaths. Or if these shootings aren't an issue to you, just carry on as normal.
3117 2018-03-30 23:27:55 i need to buy more stocks once i start working again
3118 2018-03-30 23:25:50 Dude my husband and I ALWAYS fight about the way the toilet paper goes  we came to the agreement that if he stocks it he can place it however he wants but cant complain when I put it lol.

3120 2018-03-30 23:25:36 @ospreyeye Consecutive dark signals have the best reward to risk ratio and we use screeners on any universe of stocks to find them.
3121 2018-03-30 23:24:07 I diversified my portfolio...with stocks that dropped.
3122 2018-03-30 23:20:42 If you learn anything from this last market pullback, remember to sell the news when @CNBC recommends a stock that you own. When guys like Steve Grasso @grassosteve are selling is the time to be buying the horse men stocks back.
3123 2018-03-30 23:18:34 Thanks new guy, I've just seen your thoughtful response. Since you listed stocks as #1 in your profile. It's understandable your aggressive opinion is slanted towards the bottom $. There's a whole other aspect of consistency and product confidence that many rely on for medicine.
3124 2018-03-30 23:18:32 If you want to invest in penny stocks let me know! We can turn that $0.86 into $10 bucks !!!!
3125 2018-03-30 23:18:30 Bumps stocks, the ones your messiah, Obama, approved?  Those are now illegal by Trump administration?  Hmm, that's good...right?
3126 2018-03-30 23:17:36 The Las Vegas shooter was only mass killer who used bump stocks. New law wouldn't have stopped him and his arsenal because Paddock lived in the shadows. You can literally recreate the effects of a bump stock with a belt, or a few hours of practice.
3127 2018-03-30 23:17:05 The 1960's called and wants your weak talking points back.  #2 doesn't address gun show loopholes, bump stocks, online auto mods, 60 rnd clips, lack of congruent background checks, mental etc. NRA talking points much? Coming from a fisherman and bird hunter that can aim
3128 2018-03-30 23:14:05 The Most Straight-forward Strategy For “Investing”—is to Buy Pullbacks Of Premium Stocks, into Areas Of Institutional Demand on Monthly/Weekly/  Time Frames—While Always Selling “Some” into Areas Of Institutional Supply, to Lower our Cost Basis.
3129 2018-03-30 23:14:02 No its for my stock accounts.  I get news feed on upcoming stocks to trade
3130 2018-03-30 23:12:12 I dont know what "brainwashing" you speak of but ok. I have friends on both sides of the gun issue. Most that have guns dont see a problem w most of the changes they want. The only ban they want is the AK n bump stocks.
3131 2018-03-30 23:11:53 Companies need to understand-when they attempt to support political  ideologues, they turn off those with different views =boycotts.   Ergo..watch the stocks take a hit as well as a loss of sales...and learn  that to practice this strategy is a double edge sword.
3132 2018-03-30 23:11:51 How can you tweet about corruption and then vote to repeal bump stocks and agerestrictions on military style weapons designed to mass murder people in seconds... You are going down! #BlueWave2018

3134 2018-03-30 23:10:02 The #StockMarket is like the #lottery, in that, you never 100% know what you're gonna get.

E'en if you "study stocks" you can't predict it for sure. @etrade, your commercial, telling old people to buy stocks is funny, and, that advice is fucked. FUCKED.

"Poor? Buy stocks."

3135 2018-03-30 23:08:49 He likely has investment accounts and savings accounts and stocks... with a portfolio larger than that of those who are donating to his cause.
3136 2018-03-30 23:08:20 If you needed an article to figure this out, you need advice, shouldn't be TRADING stocks without an advisor or much else. #FreebieFriday
3137 2018-03-30 23:08:19 Put your thumb in your belt loop, ease forward and it will bump fire! Bump stocks causes jams, I got rid of mine.
3138 2018-03-30 23:07:57 Yusko has also been net short stocks since Brexit. Absolutely awful
3139 2018-03-30 23:06:05 I’m Ok with the continued sale of AR-15 format rifles with the following Fed regulation:  they have to be Mary Kay pink, they must have jelly bean grips, fur stocks, and a feather boa for a sling.  5 rounds only, and to unlock, you have scream “Sashay”
3140 2018-03-30 23:03:55 There are no good-faith, serious arguments for high-capacity magazines or for bump stocks. None against requirements for registration and insurance. None against storage requirements analogous to locking your car and not leaving keys in the ignition. Just fantasy and paranoia.
3141 2018-03-30 23:03:54 Giving an inch on bump stocks, passing a shitty bill that forbids wall funding, repairing "fence," tapping Bolton, still no end to mueller...what a black pilling week
3142 2018-03-30 23:02:07 Will you be streaming the tournament?
3143 2018-03-30 23:01:31 #BlueWave2018 your stance on wanting bump stocks and military style weapons with age restroctions is going to bite you hard come voting day! @funder
3144 2018-03-30 23:00:10 A lot of it! NETFLIX STOCKS FELL BIGLY!
3145 2018-03-30 23:00:10 Why do you need an automatic rifle? My VERY conservative cousin (Col., US Army, Ret.) says he & his friends agree that pvt citizens don't need auto rifles. Or bump stocks. Or converstion kits. How do EFFECTIVE background checks affect yr rights?
3146 2018-03-30 22:59:42 This has nothing to do with bump stocks.
It's about the loss of an election...period.
3147 2018-03-30 22:59:27 We are open on Saturday 31 March from 9am and we have Easter bargains available - whilst stocks last  All foiled bunnies now £1.75  Bargain bags of small eggs just £5  Many other bargains available too . . .  #Sweet #Moments #Seaford #Easter2018 #eggs #bunnies
3148 2018-03-30 22:59:18 I've tried to get information about this directly from the manufacturers. Not surprisingly, they are very tight- lipped. It's  a long shot. However, if it happens, vanadium stocks will go the moon. It will be  a once in lifetime opportunity.
3149 2018-03-30 22:59:00 CONGRESS would not have done any thing and Trump thinks banning bump stocks is a great piece of legislation in reality it is  basic cheap TOILET PAPER, that is our congress at work
3150 2018-03-30 22:56:38 You have done the research, how much is his net worth? Don't want to be hard on a man of meager means. Recommend a site for us. We would like the true facts. Most do not understand how a man with 4 or 5mil in cash, stocks, or bonds, needs a go-fund me account. Just asking.
3151 2018-03-30 22:55:37 Yeah you're right we will need to however both Republicans Democrats and the CBO all have noted it should add 1.5 trillion to the national debt... and stocks and remain stagnant since

3154 2018-03-30 22:50:40 So, I run ads for various companies. One of these companies features crypto & cannabis stocks - traded in the USA. They shut my ad account down FOR NO REASON other than the ads “violated the community standards”!  My take: they’re cleaning up before Washington does a clean sweep.
3155 2018-03-30 22:49:44 Probably tesla stocks 
3156 2018-03-30 22:48:57 Most likely, invest some in my Robinhood since im still learning stocks. Down payment and such on a multi family home so I can live in one apt, and rent the others to help pay it off. If anything is left, to pay off debt.
3157 2018-03-30 22:46:59 You think the edges are fatter in penny stocks compared to futs?
3158 2018-03-30 22:46:33 Did the USA Second Amendment mean muskets? Or did the lawmakers of the time envision assault rifles and bump stocks?
3159 2018-03-30 22:46:16 I’m thinking Pangos and Stocks with @RemFifteen backing them up
3160 2018-03-30 22:45:20 Speak for yourself. I have more money in my pockets, less taxes taken out of my check, my stocks are soaring and there's less illegals entering the country.
3161 2018-03-30 22:44:14 The weapons inspectors had confirmedvthere were no longer any any usable stocks of chemical weapons. Saddam was contained by the time of the invasion. Regime change as such only leads to anarchy and more deaths of innocent people. Removing a dictator doesn’t create democracy.

3168 2018-03-30 22:40:06 Been following that advice and it has been doing great. Another coworker got me into penny stocks aswell, high risk but if you research and use the investment app alerts and auto/limit buy and sell features you can turn a profit with minimal risk.
3169 2018-03-30 22:38:21 want me to be more specific? $20K Real Estate, $5K shoe business, $5K stocks/trading. Adjustments will be made if needed
3170 2018-03-30 22:37:17 Making gun laws stricter and removing automatic (bump stocks and modified semi-automatic) weapons is NOT infringing on our #2A rights. Please, educate yourself because you simply regurgitating the NRA propaganda that HAS been shoved down our throats for MANY years.
3171 2018-03-30 22:36:44 The NRA advocated for restrictions on Bump Stocks.
3172 2018-03-30 22:36:27 The 2nd Amendment is NOT, I repeat NOT, being threatened. Over 70% of AMERICANS, I repeat AMERICANS, want better gun control - universal background checks, waiting period, ammo limit, increase age, ban specific semi-autos and bump stocks.

3182 2018-03-30 22:32:31 More fear tactics from the NRA.  There is a difference between a BAN and REFORM.  No one is trying to take away you 2A rights.  They do want common sense changes - restricting assault riffles, bump stocks, high capacity magazines & nationwide comprehensive background checks.

3198 2018-03-30 22:24:12 It's the quick (& easy) way of reaching revenue and growth targets. Then claim it's all down to clever strategy and hard work. Cha-Ching with the bonuses and the pay rise and a rally in your company owned stocks. Bad incentive structures.

3203 2018-03-30 22:19:16 Calling innocent people child killers doesn’t earn my support and I do believe in some gun limits. Like banning bump stocks, raising purchasing age and expanded background checks.  The NRA and private gun owners did not pull that trigger
3204 2018-03-30 22:18:47 I posted a list of corporations that Soros owns or is on the board or holds major stocks in US. You would be amazed!
3205 2018-03-30 22:18:08 It's ok Judd, these kids don't purchase products. There's a few hundred million of us who do. Not from these companies anymore. Nice job driving their sales and stocks down. Wait till you see their stocks next week. I hope you tally those percentages too.
3206 2018-03-30 22:16:30 @wilson123456 @jaydeezy83 @eddiemagicjohnson trading stocks is gambling and speculation, investing in companies is very different.
3207 2018-03-30 22:16:26 You might consider that you are on the wrong side of history. 300 Million Americans are NOT members of the NRA. There is no need for AR-15s, or bump stocks, super magazines or automatic weapons in our society. Not to mention that 60% of all adult firearm deaths are by suicide.
3208 2018-03-30 22:14:54 On est jamais vraiment vide et son se refait les stocks tres vites avec un tel spectacle
3209 2018-03-30 22:14:06 Can't wait to see my stocks go 
3210 2018-03-30 22:13:44 Comparing today’s numbers to the five-year average as of 2015 (average of stock levels from 2010-2014) the oversupply is still apparent. Crude stocks as of Jan 2018 were 163 mln brl above the 2015 5-year average while product stocks are 12 mln brl above the 2015 5-year average
3211 2018-03-30 22:10:49 The fact Aust has barely 20 days of fuel the lowest stocks of any international energy agency member is pathetic. Our federal masters are clearly incapable of doing anything oil companies don’t like. This is hi farse it must be remedied now.
3212 2018-03-30 22:10:44 ICC Labs is a hidden gem! They have the Latin market cornered and just opened the gate to Europe. Furthermore their Cannabis business isn’t affected by Canadian legalization. It’s the safest bet in Pot Stocks!

3214 2018-03-30 22:09:33 Not when things like bump stocks are legal. Then there is no difference at all. I’m not sure where this gun worship came from, but it needs to die. My Glock 19 and Ruger American Pro work just fine.

3218 2018-03-30 22:05:09 I would invest into forex, mutual funds, stocks and bonds (low risk).

3235 2018-03-30 21:54:21 The AR15 was never banned.
All that was banned were cosmetic features like grips and stocks.
3236 2018-03-30 21:54:21 Jesse, love the chart. Been wondering how I can chart my own custom indexes. I was thinking of doing market cap weighting but the multipliers would change every day. Does simply multiplying stocks like you've done here accomplish a meaningful chart?

3238 2018-03-30 21:50:54 Until the stock market crashes and all your money disappears.  It's important to not forget that stocks are not based on the inherent value of anything, and can disappear with zero recourse.
3239 2018-03-30 21:49:59 30% of my investment would go toward my household family so we can all take real estate and stock trading classes, and then I would invest 35% in real estate and 35% in stocks because love is law and family is business 
3240 2018-03-30 21:49:55 Amazon stocks are about to be tampered with ny President Trump. Buy side or sell side. Watch the ball.
3241 2018-03-30 21:49:30 Nobody legalized bump stocks you jackass!! We dont have to get every invention officially legalized in this country. Someone created them and sold them until they were made illegal! Your lack of basic understanding of the law worries me.
3242 2018-03-30 21:49:00 @JOHNSELLARS6 LOL I have been a long time Netflix person myself..I called and asked the guy how the stocks where doing. I said I wanted to cancel my acct. He did let on I was not the only one so we are not the only ones. Need to write to corporate office. LOL
3243 2018-03-30 21:48:23 So do those companies who dare to make policy because some kid told them too. They’re not in my stock portfolio. Rest assured if they were I would sell buy better. Companies who confuse business w/politics will not get my money in stocks or as consumer.
3244 2018-03-30 21:47:40 Actually they just want common sense gun laws. Background checks, banning bump stocks, raising the age to 21. No one wants your guns. Calm down and read.
3245 2018-03-30 21:47:39 Bought $5.00 in stocks, and 6 days later I’m sittin pretty at $5.02. Those 2 years in mankato’s business program are finally payin off

3248 2018-03-30 21:44:46 1) NRA statement after Las Vegas shootings & on the NRA website:  “Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least 2 occasions,
3249 2018-03-30 21:43:36 By mostly agreed upon, I meant things that most NRA members approve of but still don’t pass. Like people on the no-fly list being banned or getting rid of bump stocks. NRA members need to realize that their leadership isn’t beholden to them: it works for the gun manufacturers.
3250 2018-03-30 21:42:58 I’d love to see where the NRA says they want bump stocks banned.

3253 2018-03-30 21:41:50 They will be banned. Even the NRA wants regulation on bump stocks.
3254 2018-03-30 21:41:48 5 million towards NASA to do new explorations and to take the lead in pushing various school initiatives for science, 1 million to get my own crypto currency with my face on it. Invest in stocks, save the rest

3256 2018-03-30 21:39:55 I'm curious ..... What is it you think the liberals want to ban? Obviously I follow mostly left sources and the only thing I've heard Dems call for a ban on is bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Neither infringe on being able to hunt or be armed for protection
3257 2018-03-30 21:39:50 CIA/MI6 r the interested parties, kind like a fox researching theft in a chicken house. A #POCW convention demands any case of CW use in EU be investigated not only by the country of incident, but by the accused country n OPCW. Russia s destroyed all its CW stocks unlike Britain.

3260 2018-03-30 21:38:19 Your own company or on the top ten companies like google, amazon and Facebook.  Those stocks go up and down but are sure to profit at the end of the day.
3261 2018-03-30 21:37:24 Thank you. Ovaltine is my only tough one. I will be a label looker now and boycott. Wonder if stocks take a hit next week.

3263 2018-03-30 21:34:54 I think there are those that are poor and homeless, then those that simply live off welfare system, then those that live off businesses, stocks, and investments handed to them, and finally those of us that literally work check to check.... this is the working class.

3273 2018-03-30 21:27:35 Trump Infrastructure Speech in Ohio - Lies About the Wall, Bump Stocks, now you all know that the word infrastructure did not come from Trump's 3rd grade education someone wrote this speech for him he liked it so he decided to use it to make himself appear smart
3274 2018-03-30 21:26:50 The NRA's "sole mission to protect the 2nd Amendment" is just like PP's "sole mission to provide women's 'health care'". In other words, defending bump stocks, armored bullets and huge magazines is no different than defending late term abortion, IMO.
3275 2018-03-30 21:26:26 My mans Zucky been loosing billions in days. 

Another man these stocks been messing with is Bezos
3276 2018-03-30 21:25:14 I’m a big advocate of legalized marijuana, and have invested in stocks, BUT why doesn’t the California judicial system demand cancer warnings for spliff ????
3277 2018-03-30 21:24:34 It is different than 401 and the problem is putting all money in stocks, there are safe ways and way better than government funding!!

3280 2018-03-30 21:22:02 Tesla. Stocks just dropped cuz of a fault in there Model S. They’ll rise within a month or two once again.

3282 2018-03-30 21:21:00 Use it to fund an account to leverage trade stocks, currency pairs, idicies, etc. would then invest in crypto for long term holdings before the summer bull run. Lastly, I would use it to work on promotion and advertising for my clothing brand.
3283 2018-03-30 21:18:42 The best choice would be to invest in key stocks that are on the rise and wait until its at a comfortable selling point
3284 2018-03-30 21:17:46 KEEP THOSE COINS! REMEMBER THE CRASH OF 1929. THE RICH BOUGHT ALL THE STOCKS UP AN OWNED THE MARKET AFTERWARD. THIS IS CLASSIC MARKETS MANIPULATION. KEEP YOUR COINS!

3297 2018-03-30 21:09:27 Define assault weapons please. There are already background checks,.President Trump just signed a bill to outlaw bump stocks along with raising the age to purchase firears in Florida. Let's raise everything to 21..voting,,driving, and ban video games that use violence.
3298 2018-03-30 21:09:17 Now I see why your stocks are going down!  You won't let me schd. a ride, you keep trying to make me a driver instead of a rider & you act like you don't know these problems.  Also, discrimation on those who don't have a smart phone!! Will stay & pay more for Philly cabs!!!

3300 2018-03-30 21:05:36 No one's talking about banning guns, get a grip! The talk is about banning assault style guns, bump stocks, and automatic rifles which most states have banned. It's about federal gun laws.
3301 2018-03-30 21:04:58 Say you get your way. All weapons like the AR15 are destroyed, bump stocks are gone, everyone has a background check, and all magazines are under 10 rounds. What is your plan when someone just uses a shotgun, other rifle or pistol to do the exact same carnage?
3302 2018-03-30 21:04:17 A duty stated thusly, arising unconditionally from every expressed “opinion”, doesn’t compel assent. E.g, A to B, ‘I think there is a 54% chance equities go up in 2018’;  stocks subsequently go gown; B had put all their $ in stocks. What is A’s moral duty? @PTetlock
3303 2018-03-30 21:04:03 What Democrat? This article doesn’t reference any. Have you seen Steel stocks? They’ve been falling since tariffs. Have you heard they’re laying people off because some steel processed isn’t available here?
3304 2018-03-30 21:03:30 MH_Stocks Hi there, can you please DM us your account number, contact information, name and any more details you can provide us with? We'd like to look into this for you.
3305 2018-03-30 21:03:28 Random, even tho in Smash 4 if both are in last stocks, they apparently dont get star KOd, this only applies if the person that dies on top gets the red lightning effect when it.  If they dont, they do the whole animation thing.
3306 2018-03-30 21:02:40 By the way, Please show me the news link that says bump stocks are now banned. Another false statement.
3307 2018-03-30 21:02:06 Its quite likely when you consider ETH has more serious use cases and is already the most used blockchain. In the future if security tokens replace traditional stocks and ICO replace IPOs, it will likely see a multi trillion marketcap.

3309 2018-03-30 21:00:38 @SteveSchmidtSES I really like to listen to you on @MSNBC You Sir, speak the truth. Disgusted doesn’t begin to describe my feelings of late. For me, its not political its more about the bafoonery & the laughing stocks we have become.
3310 2018-03-30 21:00:31 Warning: if you use acorns it individually invests in stocks for you, and the resulting tax documentation is annoying.
3311 2018-03-30 21:00:27 And I definitely suggest a solution like the one I mentioned over just going out and buying stocks from select companies yourself. Those services spread your investments out and help reduce risk.
3312 2018-03-30 20:58:50 LOL you just don't get it. Your President is in favor or banning bump stocks, which makes bump firing far easier, and your come back is that banning bump stocks are meaningless? Then why is the President doing it? Why is the NRA fighting it?
3313 2018-03-30 20:58:40 Energy stocks! Sunny season is approaching

3318 2018-03-30 20:54:56 Yeah but if the likely chance of the plane being there when in all reality is not that far from them, why wouldn't they continue and get paid? & don't you think their reputation will sky rocket as a company if they did find it!! I'm buying stocks now lol

3322 2018-03-30 20:52:05 Because AR15s and bump stocks are the weapons of choice of America's mass murderers.
3323 2018-03-30 20:51:56 Bump stocks are gonna be banned, most hand guns are also semi automatic and in a close quarter kind of situation I believe a hand gun can be just as lethal
Just my opinion
3324 2018-03-30 20:51:31 I was wondering which stocks have dumbasses as CEO so I can short them...now I know..
3325 2018-03-30 20:50:36 1. Pay of any credit cards or high interest items.
2. Open emergency account for 3mths of Bills.
3. Asset allocation: bonds, stocks, fixed products.
4. Your Program!!!
3326 2018-03-30 20:50:35 (cont)...like it or not... when you pull the trigger on a double-action revolver, it puts the next round in line to be fired.. JUST LIKE a semi-auto. And if some could get bump stocks on the shelf because of a technicality, some will want to have a revolver classified as semiauto
3327 2018-03-30 20:49:09 Don’t forget you have the Totally Not Crazy Or Racist Breitbart and Alex Jones.  Because they’re not journalistic laughing stocks either.
3328 2018-03-30 20:49:09 Que son los stocks?
3329 2018-03-30 20:47:30 No PDT in cash account for any trades. Just stocks take 3days to settle. Options 1day.

3332 2018-03-30 20:46:00 What tyranny are we talking about now, NRA?  Reasonable waiting periods, limits on bump stocks, limits on 30 round mags, age limits, or permit requirements?  The fear mongering NRA gives “tyranny” a bad name.  Quit crying wolf.
3333 2018-03-30 20:45:47 Hi Mark - i do not believe we do at the moment. We support CME futures contracts though. We are looking into adding ICE but do not have specific plans yet. We support NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ for stocks, CME for futures and all major Forex pairs and dozens of cryptos at moment.
3334 2018-03-30 20:43:50 Doubt it. J&J is one of the most widely owned stocks. If you have a 401k, you have stock. Why?  Because it has been one of the most stable and profitable companies for over 100 years. Moral - investors care about their money and J&J provides money.

3337 2018-03-30 20:41:12 They were Democrats and not NRA members. That’s your people. The gun for Florida was obtained under obamas reign. He allowed bump Stocks twice. That’s your people and your problem. “When we get bump Stocks we won’t stop there!” Are you going to come and get them?
3338 2018-03-30 20:40:40 Microsoft and Google stocks are gonna take a hit next
3339 2018-03-30 20:38:21 From new @CNBC survey: Americans’ stock market exuberance has dipped: 41% say it’s a good time to invest in stocks, down 9 points since December.
3340 2018-03-30 20:38:02 I am investing in real estate, than with what’s left over I am going to make a diversified stock portfolio that would have the top medical stocks, tech stocks, defense stocks and very High paying dividend stocks! @spenc319
3341 2018-03-30 20:36:54 I’ll invest $10k into reselling sneakers cause sneakers reselling market is booming 
2.5k into stocks
3.10k in taco trucks cause who doesn’t like tacos  
4.5k in emergency funds
3342 2018-03-30 20:35:51 Oh how cute, when do we get to the part about buying bump stocks, 100 shot magazines, thousands of rounds of ammo? Gun humping mass murderers and snuff porn video watching NRA cult fetish ammo sexuals need their gratification.
3343 2018-03-30 20:35:13 Bonsoir la vente privée vient tout juste de se terminer mais vous pouvez encore profiter des tarifs exceptionnels jusqu’à épuisement des stocks

3344 2018-03-30 20:34:23 It means next time they should use VX ! I'm sure #PortonDown has stocks on hand
3345 2018-03-30 20:34:16 This administration has put a bill out that passed the house & also banned bump stocks.Obamas never did. That is just a fact. And they are still working on it. It's more than any administration has ever done.
3346 2018-03-30 20:32:49 Minecraft stocks.
3347 2018-03-30 20:32:38 #BoycottNutrish Hear that?  Stocks crashing!
3348 2018-03-30 20:32:22 In all, just 54% of Americans invest in the market, either through individual stocks, mutual funds, pensions or retirement plans like a 401(k), according to Gallup. That's down 11% since the Great Recession. Stop spreading propaganda like FOX news.
3349 2018-03-30 20:31:45 haha, yea. I know. If only this music knowledge can be transported back in time to my younger self.... and to invest in Apple & amazon stocks when they were at 45 a share lol.
3350 2018-03-30 20:31:28 T R U M P Y   Bump stocks are still being made and sold. YOUR a LIAR.
3351 2018-03-30 20:30:28 It's finished already. But you can get a 1tb xbox one s plus pubg, far cry 5 and Forza 7 for £230, while stocks last
3352 2018-03-30 20:30:17 Your best bet is to find a specialist store that stocks British drinks or a good British pub/bar. Good luck 
3353 2018-03-30 20:28:17 yep seen 21 on GFS for 11th April !! That would be nice although would be great to have a hot summer knowing we have enough water stocks to survive 4 weeks of no rain and panic TV reports showing empty rivers
3354 2018-03-30 20:27:51 I'll be watching their stocks tumble!!! The left and these companies have just violated the freedom of speech.
3355 2018-03-30 20:27:22 if they just made some minor rules about bump stocks and background checks then this would be all a nothing burger but Fox and Trump were stubborn with their support of the NRA and now a monster has been created KIDS!
3356 2018-03-30 20:26:16 Confiscation of bump stocks in Massachusetts without compensation is yet another step down the long road of bullshit.. where does the road end? In a country where the government finally reached its goal.. which is to govern you. I know I don’t wanna be governed.
3357 2018-03-30 20:26:16 Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary got elected, your stocks would be really nice if the baby is part of the Falcon Factory.
3358 2018-03-30 20:26:11 We have been advocating the return of the stocks for many years now, there is a law on the statue books from 1406 whereby any town will be downgraded to a village if it does not have a set of public stocks. Stocks were used to curb antisocial behaviours of the day! #Manicfesto
3359 2018-03-30 20:24:17 Zuckerboy wonder sold out FB stocks just before the fall.  But where did he reinvest?  I promise you this FBI asset lost nothing in taking down our communication network.  Things are rarely as they seem.  LOOK THRU THINGS NOT JUST AT THEM.
3360 2018-03-30 20:23:50 Crazy things were going on with these stocks in 2010-12(many are now gone). Several had implied volatility in the triple digits in so-called normal environments. @barronsonline had an awesome article called “Beware This Chinese Export” in 2010 if you’re interested in the topic.
3361 2018-03-30 20:23:46 After falling 1200 points erasing 4th qt gains. Past year USD weakened against major currencies while stocks soared and interest rates rose indicating inflation & market bubble. Glad market recovered a portion of 1st qt losses. Japanese yen edged up.

3363 2018-03-30 20:23:18 People are strange. People who steal or throw away the lunch of others are horrible. An hour in the stocks should be the punishment!

3365 2018-03-30 20:20:24 Please show me the 2nd A wording that gives you the right to own bump stocks, high cap mags, silencers, armor piercing rounds, etc. You get guns. That is all.
3366 2018-03-30 20:19:43 Okay so I've cast some more prosthetics. I have an art table at a convention in a week so I'm trying to get my stocks up. 

Current prosthetics orders are being foam-filled today. 

After that, yet more sewing on the never-ending feetpaws commissions

3371 2018-03-30 20:15:32 COD is dying because whoever is at the top making these awful decisions,  has remained at the top. Stocks have plummeted, fans have left,  opposition has become more creative.  Through it all, same guy at the top.  #ChaosTop10
3372 2018-03-30 20:14:55 I have no problem with getting rid of bump stocks. But an AR-15? Why because it looks scarry? Plenty of states regulate this rifle, 10 round magazines only, no pistol grip and no detachable magazines for instance. Far more people killed by drunk drivers then an AR-15.
3373 2018-03-30 20:14:13 Thanks for the Pop-Tarts Sugar Cookie love. Our limited time flavors could be carried by any store that typically stocks Pop-Tarts. Although you may find them while supplies last, they will likely be increasingly difficult to find, as they were intended for the holiday season.

3380 2018-03-30 20:05:22 Maybe @realDonaldTrump will die on the golf course with a burger & fry in his hand. That would make a good story. Fat orange man dies for McDonald's foods. The only question will their stocks go up or down. USA stock will rise for sure!
3381 2018-03-30 20:05:01 And we need to keep our bump stocks even though I don’t own one I’m thinking of buying one
3382 2018-03-30 20:04:53 @FXS_Stocks_EN Thanks for the follow!

3386 2018-03-30 20:01:51 @POTUS is doing what he can to eliminate mods like bump stocks. Point is the founders wanted the civilian population to be armed in a way that was equal to governments
3387 2018-03-30 20:01:35 Hey @VoteRandyFine why do you not want waiting periods when buying guys?  what are you so afraid of?  and no ban on bump stocks?  Are you hoping for another Las Vegas shooting?

3389 2018-03-30 20:00:44 @cinnamonaitch so excited to have received our first stocks of your stunning cards!!! 
3390 2018-03-30 19:59:58 Pistol grip improves ergonomics, does not alter the function of the gun.
30 rd mags are actually standard with an AR.
You can add a scope to virtually ANY gun. My .22 has one.
Bump stocks do not convert a semi to full auto, only machining and different sear do that (illegal).
3391 2018-03-30 19:59:35 @POTUS ok so they got their background checks and bump stocks where is #NationalReciprocity ? @NRATV @NRA
3392 2018-03-30 19:59:02 Buyin bottles just to sit in the crib and look at my stocks my retirement plans and new properties I’m inquiring about... we gettin this out the mud out the dirt and just praying God let’s us maintain and grow for our families
3393 2018-03-30 19:57:42 OK. So on CFP, how has UK voted (hint, generally to restrict catches to protect stocks). And why did UK gov allocate to large ships not many small ones? And why did UK fishermen sell off their quotas to foreign ships them complain they didn't have quotas? Why can we now eat cod?
3394 2018-03-30 19:56:31 How do I make my £4.50 yearly ISA interest work for me before 5th April? Stocks? Bullion? My bank is clearly taking the piss.
3395 2018-03-30 19:55:43 Although I’m an avid sportsman, I also feel strongly about common sense gun safety. I support universal background checks, banning bump stocks & other measures to keep communities safe. To make progress on this issue, I feel that it is important to include the hunting community.
3396 2018-03-30 19:54:50 Lol- if you don’t think a 12 month chart going down 1 cent in this climate is a big issue then you don’t understand investment- Biz climate got better- stocks rose at record levels- Starbucks was flat for 12-18 months- yes. Big deal.
3397 2018-03-30 19:54:41 Funny to see that many people are just frustrated because $BTC is falling, rather being happy to see how many companies are growing and developing the future.For me those are Stocks 2.0 welcome to the 70s again where everybody have the time now 2 participate $FLIXX $ENG $VEN $QLC

3400 2018-03-30 19:52:04 BREAKING: The Vermont Senate voted to send a landmark gun reform bill to @GovPhilScott’s desk! It includes universal background checks, bump stocks, ups the age to 21, & restricts high capacity mags. Such an amazing effort from everyone involved! #gunreformnow #MarchForOurLives
3401 2018-03-30 19:52:01 Q1 was a disaster strategy wise. I know I can pick the right stocks or coins, now gotta know when to sell. #NoteToSelf
3402 2018-03-30 19:51:40 He has already de-nuked NK, fixed the infrastructure, banned bump-stocks, etc.  It's time for him to rest.   Just ask him.  #TrumpLies #TrumpIsLazy #MoronDon
3403 2018-03-30 19:51:23 Let me correct you. We don’t want to replace the 2nd amendment. Just ban military weapons, hi cap magazines and bump stocks. The weapons of madmen.
NRA sales pitch” they want your guns  be afraid buy more guns“ doesn’t work anymore
3404 2018-03-30 19:51:14 Uhh I clearly heard with my own ears a certain terrorist saying give us an inch and we’ll take a mile.  Referring to bump stocks.  Uhhh no.
3405 2018-03-30 19:50:21 Just referring to the fact that stocks have historically responded well to rising rates and over the couple months the correlation between SPX & TNX has been trending more positive so if rates were to take another run towards 3 it should be associated with strength in stocks.
3406 2018-03-30 19:47:07 Keep it simple bro. Create a diversified portfolio of assets - mostly equities, either stocks or ETFs - with low fees and then forget about it and let it ride for 25 - 50 years. Your great grandchildren will thank you.
3407 2018-03-30 19:47:06 False. DOJ/ATF has declared a public comment period for a proposed rule declaring them illegal under the NFA/GCA. Setting the wisdom of a ban (I'm for it) or DOJs unilateral changing of a legislative definition (I'm against it), bump stocks are currently still legal.
3408 2018-03-30 19:46:40 @realDonaldTrump just a reminder, if you ban bump stocks with no legislation from congress, either way a stupid idea, you are no better than the executive overreach from Obama.
3409 2018-03-30 19:46:27 The fact that the NRA wants to block even the most agreed-upon gun reform measure, banning bump stocks, clearly indicates they should not be at the table when trying to develop #gunreform legislation. They’re like that bratty kid who says NO! to every request
3410 2018-03-30 19:45:35 Spiders can shit out a new house that stocks itself with food whenever they feel like it. #Showerthoughts
3411 2018-03-30 19:45:28 It might be “freedom”to have the ability to shoot 20 bullets 100 bullets exactly when dose one want to do that? Freedom is being manipulated for stocks and fear by all means collect more bullets and guns make sure they stay with the owners, They’re not toys. Responsibility now
3412 2018-03-30 19:45:19 Handguns and shotguns. Nothing semi-automatic. Definitely nothing automatic. No bump stocks. No war-like weapons.
3413 2018-03-30 19:43:50 Simple reading comprehension tells me his question was "so how are bump stocks legal?", not him saying they were illegal and me criticizing it.
The ATF twice confirmed bump stocks do not alter the functionality of a gun, therefore do not fall under Class III restrictions.
3414 2018-03-30 19:43:24 Invest in stocks lol
3415 2018-03-30 19:43:00 Hey I know um what's stocks to buy I see the future for real shame no big bad trump
3416 2018-03-30 19:42:31 If you don’t use stops in options then 1.  enter on a good setups and 2. enter stocks I would own  3.  Sell covered call to get out or earn income.    Just part of my plan.    Share your plan!!!

Sorry for all the people who are affected by this.
3419 2018-03-30 19:41:01 I pulled all of my stocks out of Allstate, if you are able to do that as well that would be fantastic! Hit em in the pocketbook then they’ll listen!!
3420 2018-03-30 19:38:41 Ya know Kurt is a raving lunatic. He sold all his stocks when krugman said the market was going to crash bc if trump being president. Still laughing at those!
3421 2018-03-30 19:38:14 Bump stock is no longer legal under regulation. The DOJ has the authority to limit manufacture of machine guns and has ruled bump stocks to be under that definition.
3422 2018-03-30 19:36:38 DiFi herself she would if she could. That’s not worrisome at all.Then a fmr SupCt Justice says he’s in favor of repealing it. A speaker said they give us bump stocks we’ll take a mile. Then references to Australia’s system which confiscated firearms. You’re not paying attention.
3423 2018-03-30 19:36:18 PS you criticised a tweet saying bump stocks were illegal. That's where I got the idea you were commenting on those laws.
3424 2018-03-30 19:36:15 If u wanna make extra money dont do fraud,  invest in stocks,  bonds,  bitcoins,  put money away.  Etc people do fraud and scam instead of just doing legitimate stuff.

3427 2018-03-30 19:30:58 I know some good stocks to invest in because these coins suck
3428 2018-03-30 19:30:38 That’s a 1-year chart. Lol. Not a one day price...I hope you don’t own stocks- bc you should never be so focused on the big, shiny objects and miss the details underneath
3429 2018-03-30 19:29:44 AR15, magazines, bump stocks, are not needed for one to hunt or feel safe.
3430 2018-03-30 19:29:32 Pointless.  He’ll be forgotten in a week.  On the other hand, I’ve already closed my TripAdvisor, Hulu, & Expedia accounts and have stopped buying from the other coward companies.  Sell your stocks now!

3433 2018-03-30 19:29:07 You seriously just posted a 0.01% drop as a sign of something bad. Hopefully you don’t own stocks, because you don’t understand them.

3441 2018-03-30 19:22:32 Buy stocks that are NOT part of the bigger indicies. Companies with low debt, good management, decreasing compeditors, and increasing pricing power. Has to be in sectors NOT liable for increased regulation or ggeopolitical risks - how said investing was easy?

3445 2018-03-30 19:19:48 David Hogg has repeatedly said that his family owns guns and he is not in favor of repealing the 2nd Amendment, only the choice weapon of mass murderers and their bump stocks.
3446 2018-03-30 19:18:08 that's why i trade stocks and don't talk to women. lolz!
3447 2018-03-30 19:17:58 1. A bump stock wasn't used to kill the children in Parkland.
2. Bump stocks are legal under statute and administrative rule.
3. You can't logically hold a manufacturer liable for negligent design if the modification is legal itself.

We don't want to repeal the 2nd amendment, we just want to ban sales of AR15'S, large capacity magazines, and bumper stocks. How about that donation of $30,000,000 to Trump, that you received from Russia? Looking GUILTY!

3460 2018-03-30 19:08:51 I'm referring to bump stocks.
3461 2018-03-30 19:07:44 Since when do your "rights" include the right to own military-grade weaponry? Or bump-stocks? No one wants to take your precious manhood-symbols away from you, only to establish sensible controls over who can buy them.
3462 2018-03-30 19:07:12 No thanks on shorting stocks. I try to avoid loans whenever possible.
3463 2018-03-30 19:06:01 The tech stocks like amazon and fb crashing due to recent news and the stock market in general acting up. In case they don't recover the price before May end we might see some of them enter crypto space.
3464 2018-03-30 19:03:54 But the power of prayer? Doesn't that bring Chinese stocks to you too?
3465 2018-03-30 19:01:55 It agrees with you. Yes, bump stocks were used.  However, I don't believe you realize what they are. They are not an instrument of accuracy at long range at all. In fact, as the article states, they hindered more killing. It's very helpful to know guns, laws, and restrictions.
3466 2018-03-30 19:01:36 I saw the list the whole thing has turned to laughing stocks sir
3467 2018-03-30 19:00:14 Regarding "weapons of war".  An Armalite Rifle is in fact an aggressive looking rifle. It is however, not a machine gun.
Like all semi- automatic rifles whether black plastic stocks, or wood, each shot requires a pull of the trigger. Not a weapon of war.
3468 2018-03-30 18:59:47 @kurteichenwald of course we believe you. You told me to sell all my stocks in Nov 2016 and I did. Good thing the DOL Fiduciary rule isn’t being enforced. I’m not sure you have the proper licenses to act as a Fiduciary but we could ask @SenWarren if it meets the criteria.

3478 2018-03-30 18:51:21 I just read your whole link from your source and no where does it state that it’s a known fact bump-stocks where not used. Your source claims they “believe” bump stocks were not used.
3479 2018-03-30 18:50:13 The economy is better, stocks up GDP up & lowest unemployment in 45 years with more industries coming back. What’s so wonderful is that I’ve worked with minority children & unemployment with African Americans & Latinos is at the lowest ever.

3483 2018-03-30 18:49:24 I hate that I can't edit. Bump stocks were used in Vegas.  It helped, not hindered the amt of casualties
3484 2018-03-30 18:49:08 @GoldDoubleEagle or maybe I should laugh at the fact that you are 22y/o flipping stocks on robin Hood?  No, I respect & listen instead.

3486 2018-03-30 18:47:22 I’d rather everyone sell off their stocks! These Companies are obviously poorly Managed if they make Business decisions  based upon. Either Political Side! #Boycotts are 1st Amendment tools!  So yes if #Boycott is tool to show displeasure with a Stupid decision!!!
3487 2018-03-30 18:43:36 No deal would probably lead to overfishing and the depletion of stocks. It would result in the imposition of tariff barriers. Above all, the British would have to ask themselves whether they could effectively patrol and defend UK waters against fishing boats from EU states.
3488 2018-03-30 18:42:50 UK vessels benefit from rights to fish large quantities of cod in North Norwegian waters that are “paid for” by transfers to Norway of other stocks which are mainly of value to other EU countries. CFP definitely helps the UK in that regard.
3489 2018-03-30 18:40:39 no doubt. Im with you. I think it could easily pullback under $1200, but its one of those unique stocks that people think they understand so they throw cash at it indescriminately. Perfect for options.
3490 2018-03-30 18:40:29 Ryan used reconciliation, ergo only 50 votes for passage, no hearings, no experts, no amendments and fast tracked this gift to corps. and very rich donors.

3491 2018-03-30 18:40:21 The Bloom Cafe stocks paper straws and I already had someone ask me why. I thought everyone knew about those.

3503 2018-03-30 18:27:50 @davidhogg111 it is hard to take on the 2nd Amendment but if we can ban bump stocks, high capacity mags and make bullets expensive or hard or impossible to get the guns in question would be useless.   It is thier right to own a gun but it is not their right to have the ammunition
3504 2018-03-30 18:27:40 He is a fraud.  And mindless little sheep like you eat his rhetoric filled garbage by the bowl.  Those companies will see lowered stock and lost sales just like Dicks and the others that pulled their ads.  Good luck.  Hope you didn't own any of their stocks.  Get a clue.

3508 2018-03-30 18:18:00 All the time you have trump in power it will get worse , he is replacing staff with yes men not economic advisers.  So just more QE  and print money to pay deficit.  Now china could stop buying US debt ..... his beloved stocks will fall as well  recession coming

3511 2018-03-30 18:15:47 @FinFreeFlex Do you normally stick to just buying and selling stocks, or do you do a lot with options too?
3512 2018-03-30 18:14:18 YES freezing scraps!! Also, can't wait to use my InstantPot for stocks. It's gotta be so much less time intensive, yeah?
3513 2018-03-30 18:13:14 I would love to see the stocks of these companies today. I won't be buying anything from them, way to many other options, then those that cave to a teenager who uses bullying to get his way.
3514 2018-03-30 18:13:05 I don’t see a need for bump stocks, but I don’t agree with raising the age to 21.  If they are old enough to serve in the military then they are old enough to buy a gun.

3518 2018-03-30 18:09:52 I haven’t heard a single one of those kids suggest doing away with 2A. They want AR-15 type weapons,  bump stocks, and high capacity magazines out of the hands of everyone but the military and law enforcement. They have a right to be secure too.
3519 2018-03-30 18:08:19 The UK has the second largest catch of fish ( 752000 tonnes) of any country in the EU . The policy was to help keep fish stocks at a sustainable level

3521 2018-03-30 18:07:20 Im probably not going to gain any friends. I am extremely pro gun/2nd amnd, but dont feel civilians need such things as bump stocks. Not that honest gun owners cant handle it but there are to many less thans out in society.
3522 2018-03-30 18:06:21 Yep they sure have. Wondering what their stocks look like today?

3524 2018-03-30 18:05:11 If you dont have a clear answer its probably because you listen to right wing sources. Again for the 1000th time. We want stronger background checks. Increase in age limit and waiting period to purchase guns. Ban on Bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Close gun show loophole
3525 2018-03-30 18:04:52 Precisely. These gun nuts have corrupted the meaning of the 2nd Amendment all for profit, nothing else.  There's no rationale reason for any civilian to open automatic guns or bump stocks.  One gun per non-criminal adult is sufficient for protection.

2. Holding stocks of great companies through extreme drawdowns is not for everyone, but yields the best returns. See: @netflix @amazon

3539 2018-03-30 17:54:54 The left wants to ban bump stocks, wants universal background checks, wants to raise the age of buying a gun to 21, that's great, but what does the right get? How bout National Conceal Carry Reciprocity? The left does not play fairly. No wonder why nothing can get accomplished.
3540 2018-03-30 17:54:31 Can you explain what a bump stocks does?

3547 2018-03-30 17:50:04 HUGE VICTORY!

3549 2018-03-30 17:48:41 “False dichotomy between guns and the deaths of woman and children”. What a joke. The proximate cause of the deaths of 59 and injury of 500 in Vegas was assault riffles with bump stocks. How many would have died and injured if he had a knife at a Country concert. Please.

Hey @TheOliverStone - try shooting a Russian version of "Wall Street." Instead of stocks, the basis of the movie would be the rise of the #Oligarchs via theft, corruption, etc. And be sure to show #Putin shoving billions into his personal accounts.
3556 2018-03-30 17:38:58 It was the ATF under Obama that allowed bump stocks. So telling the ATF to re-look into their decision is the proper course to take.
3557 2018-03-30 17:38:49 But if the overall #market trend is down and volatile, great #stocks can change the direction within a day and start a new consolidation. Look at $SGH or $SSTI. They look perfect but the overall market pressure affects such stocks, too.
3558 2018-03-30 17:38:13 Huh. Looking at my 401k returns over the last 10 years: 

2008: Negative 38%
2009: 27%
2010: 17%
2011: 5%
2012: 16%
2013: 36% 
2014: 12%
2015: 1.5%
2016: 13%
2017: 21%
Ytd: negative 2%

You must have a pretty screwed up basket of stocks. My 401k did great under Obama.

3564 2018-03-30 17:34:22 Exactly!  They were banking on, hell, probably another 8 years of record gun sales.  Just Google "gun manufacturers stocks".  They are hurting bad, especially after Parkland.
3565 2018-03-30 17:33:18 *** This is important **** ater looking at the behavior of mkts the force that is making the equities futures/options/stocks move so violently is very similar to 85 - 87 OEX options and sp500 future front running.

3569 2018-03-30 17:31:23 Even the NRA doesn't like bump stocks. 
Hogg and the people supporting him want full repeal of the 2A.
 I jumped on Trump about his due process statement and raising the age limit. 
They have become political activist and will be called out on non factual statements

3572 2018-03-30 17:30:53 My best advice is to STUDY! Review charts on stocks that fit your trading criteria on daily and intraday time frames. Understand technical AND fundamental analysis and how it affects the price movement of a stock. I'll send you a small list of good twitter traders to follow also.
3573 2018-03-30 17:30:52 after learning about crypto and stocks this year, re-watching 'the big short' is so much more intriguing.
3574 2018-03-30 17:30:13 I love money, but I have been an absolute idiot with it all my life. I've finally gotten smart with it these last few years. Stocks, bonds, 401K, IRA, Savings. Anything to grow my money I have invested in. Worth it long term.
3575 2018-03-30 17:30:11 That sounds really good.. and at the same time your CFO and CEO are lending out stocks. And you dont feel the need to explain that ?
3576 2018-03-30 17:27:27 Joke A: I tried my hand at stocks and I am really fond of food.

Campbell's started crashing & I lost my soup, but I still have Chicken Stock.
3577 2018-03-30 17:27:27 Also, your reply is false. I can't find a shred of  evidence Starbucks fell at all in January '17. In fact, the articles I saw said stocks were improving. Send me a link from a reputable source before you post garbage screenshots

3591 2018-03-30 17:16:57 I just prefer to make choices that will set me in the future like, making investments in stocks.
3592 2018-03-30 17:16:56 Congrats! Not doing too bad but long delta on stocks (puts), /CAD and some scalping without the discipline needed hurt. Do you avoid stocks at all?
3593 2018-03-30 17:16:04 I think you just hang out at factories and then are like, "oooh, those new cardboard boxes aren't gonna work." [Somehow get money to short stocks] "Hooray, I'm rich!"

3596 2018-03-30 17:14:54 See how those companies do when their stocks go down. Some just never learn! I personally have boycotted every company, product & people that have gone against Trump or have made it clear which side they are on. However I'm using Twit as a platform until a new platform comes.
3597 2018-03-30 17:13:37 Prediction: the almost decade bull market in stocks will end at the same time as the decades old bull market in bonds. No idea of timing or catalyst, but both are tired.
3598 2018-03-30 17:11:14 Research crimes committed with bump stocks and let me know how you feel it would justify a ban. Get back with me.
3599 2018-03-30 17:09:00 Bumb stocks need to go. No use for them. Age should have never nren changed to 21.

3604 2018-03-30 17:05:50 That is what you call market manipulation. Just as bad as insider trading. The only people that also take advantage of this are people with access to the money and Capitol. That is why people that are in to stocks love  what he is doing because they can see his habit and behavior
3605 2018-03-30 17:05:16 The Great Plunge has not yet happened.  Be careful out there with stocks especially if you are planning on retiring soon.  DOW $17,500 would be a normal correction. But the house of cards (massive debt) could collapse even more than that
3606 2018-03-30 17:04:38 What a waste of money 
3607 2018-03-30 17:04:02 Haha he's on flames at the mo! Are you watching Jordan Rhodes 
3608 2018-03-30 17:04:01 Possession of the bump stocks in the state was illegal. Point is, they broke the law
3609 2018-03-30 17:03:11 Not disagreeing w you on that, however the NRA has been pushing for CC to cross state lines, against banning bump stocks or AR-15s & background checks, & pushed to make it easier for the mentally ill to get guns so yeah, if they weren't in MA this might not have been illegal.

3615 2018-03-30 17:01:17 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.
3616 2018-03-30 17:00:59 My portfolio is looking really good . I thought finishline was gonna be my low blow but it picked its self up and now all my stocks are green ... for now #emotialRollercoster

3620 2018-03-30 16:58:18 Non military citizens DO NOT have access to military weapons. An AR15 is just a dressed up rifle. There are rifles with the exact same specs that have wood stocks. The probes lies in mental illness. Restricting them from getting weapons will help. But blaming a gun is dumb.
3621 2018-03-30 16:57:43 In the meantime, answer the question. Is it radical for background checks, banning military weapons, banning bump stocks? Is it radical?
3622 2018-03-30 16:56:41 Is @carlstubbs92 crying??
3623 2018-03-30 16:56:33 They used bump stocks to convert semi automatic rifles in automatic weapons. There is a huge difference. President Trump has signed a ban order to make them illegal.   They were legal under the Obama administration!!
3624 2018-03-30 16:54:33 I suggest you study financial history starting with the Tulip bubble in Holland almost 400 yrs ago. You obviously weren't around for the dot com bubble in '98/'99. Check out class A Tokyo real estate in the '90s or small cap gold stocks in 2008.
3625 2018-03-30 16:53:52 That's my point son. It didn't help.

If he didn't have multiple large clips and guns and bump stocks, more people would be alive.

And open carry didn't do a damn thing.

3631 2018-03-30 16:48:00 Happens in every bubble. People use to buy tech stocks with credit cards in 1999.
3632 2018-03-30 16:47:59 You @realDonaldTrump / @POTUS do a GREAT job cheerleading @BarackObama's economy, as much as you've tried dismantling it. Don't worry, your influence will reign soon enough, and the stocks will fall & the unemployed will rise... #ThanksObama for truly #MAGA
3633 2018-03-30 16:47:12 Tims dvds work together. You can't buy one and expect to learn how to trade stocks that's absolutely ridiculous to think.

3635 2018-03-30 16:46:52 First off, that license from the ATF cost upwards of $200 and is STRICTLY regulated, not just anyone can get one.  Second, bump stocks are now also banned.

3650 2018-03-30 16:38:04 No apologies and no surrender. Honestly I could care less about bump stocks and will never own one.  Steel up and not give one inch.
3651 2018-03-30 16:37:35 Like yours after telling a joke and drinking a pint of chocolate porter 
3652 2018-03-30 16:37:04 But this doesn't seem to addr the fact that there will be ppl who will game the system. Even build reputation for running with the loot. Without sovereign backing, one might as well invest in stocks, etc. I'm not sure it can work with no regulation 
3653 2018-03-30 16:36:16 It's time to buy just before Q4 earnings starts... stocks available at attractive price after correcting over 30%-50%

3655 2018-03-30 16:35:46 The car argument is complete and utter BS. Cars are built as transportation, not weapons. The fact that people use them to kill is irrelevant. Firearms are built to kill, maim, and destroy. Bump stocks allow that process to happen faster than any civilian needs.

3662 2018-03-30 16:32:21 I think the investment world is really upside down.  Some of these tech stocks are too cheap vs. what people traditionally regard as safe.
3663 2018-03-30 16:31:45 Here are some common sense gun laws:
Ban AR-15 type assault weapons.
Ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and armor-piercing rounds.
Increase waiting periods for certain types of weapons, especially if assault weapons aren't banned.
Increase age allowed to buy guns to 21.
3664 2018-03-30 16:31:18 Despite whether stocks will rise or fall (ample evidence suggests they fail) the bulls still don't comprehend how insanely valued stocks. Someone try to justify valuations. This is so overlooked for btfd ignorance that prevails. EPS beats are likely to be on fake earn (buybacks)

3681 2018-03-30 16:23:59 I think he did pass a BG check, as for bump stocks, they are now illegal but that’s not going to stop a criminal from getting one.
3682 2018-03-30 16:23:57 Good point, we disagree on whether a ban on bump stocks is sensible.  Sure it can be debated, but it's not really up to one individual (neither me or you). But I'm on stronger ground when I saw the vast majority of Americans have already agreed banning bump stocks is a good idea.
3683 2018-03-30 16:23:34 @kwelkernbc 3/He said ‘We got rid of the bump stocks. The bump stocks now are under very strict control. It doesn’t get reported.’  But the administration’s proposed ban on bump stocks has not been finalized; the public comments process doesn’t close until June 27.

3778 2018-03-30 15:53:21 Yes. It’s radical to want background checks. It’s radical to say military grade weapons should stay in the military. It’s radical to say bump stocks aren’t necessary. /sarcasm

3783 2018-03-30 15:48:42 The #NRA lies like a rug. The #MarchForOurLives is not trying to repeal the 2A and ban all guns. Close background check loopholes, prevent domestic abusers, violent criminals, mentally ill from owning guns, ban AR-15s, require owners carry insurance, ban bump stocks, large clips.
3784 2018-03-30 15:46:54 Test is definitely the hardest(not sure about importance part). Only very few people appreciate/watch it these days. Ok if kohli and smith are stocks who would you invest on? My pick is kohli.
3785 2018-03-30 15:45:32 It's hard for me to believe that they'd break into the stock exchange like that, at the same time have Bruce Wayne dump all his stocks, and have everyone treat it like the company has to move on.

3845 2018-03-30 15:28:23 No ban on guns or gun parts including bump stocks. This same scenario played out in Vietnam Nam and pre-WWII Germany. The Demorats are into resisting Trump. Armed citizens have now found their issue to resist. #2A is not negotiable.

3863 2018-03-30 15:15:33 Yo Joe, as long as the Fed runs the "printing press" I expect stocks to resume it's parabolic move up after this pause. I think any collapse in stocks will be quick n dirty; more/less a shakeout. My money's on the dollar getting kille, coming ag crisis and reset.
3864 2018-03-30 15:12:38 And for the record, I don’t own a bump stock, and I have no objections to banning them.  
I just don’t think it will have any impact on crime or mass shootings if they are banned.  
When MA banned them, they sent letters to all gun owners — only three bump stocks were turned in
3865 2018-03-30 15:12:14 Combine that with the fact that stocks are way overvalued in terms of P/E ratios and you have all the indicators for a crash coming.

3871 2018-03-30 15:05:58 As an investment, stocks provide a better return (using equal leverage) and have far less hassle.  If fixing things and dealing with renters is something you don't mind, real estate could be for you.  I prefer low hassle.

3879 2018-03-30 14:59:58 Some state pensions are only underfunded because administrators invested in the stock market and lost millions during the Great Recession .

This transferred teacher retirement money to top income investors that made money due to inside info and shorting stocks.
3880 2018-03-30 14:59:51 Trump uses his presidency to affect stocks.
Another abuse of power.
I believe he’s got it in for Amazon’s CEO because he’s beyond jealous of “ the richest man”— isn’t this blatant abuse enough to slap the cuffs on him?
He is playing with our lives.
Ridiculous that we can’t act.
3881 2018-03-30 14:59:43 Yes but if the price of blue chip stocks goes up and the number of shares remains the same then more value is stored in blue chip stocks.
3882 2018-03-30 14:59:43 You do know that that corporate neolib's healthcare plan is actually a right winged healthcare policy? Not that has anything to do with universal background checks, a new assault weapons ban, and a ban on bump stocks which we were originally talking about in the first place!
3883 2018-03-30 14:59:39 Just like the NRA did to make donations and gun merchants sold out on bump stocks trump "hoped" to limit..(lol, token marketing scam from the 'deal maker') but didn't even try. I actually am starting to fear for them Kids, as these oppressive hyper conservatives are unstable..

3913 2018-03-30 14:57:58 Bump stocks are being addressed to make illegal. Automatic weapons are already illegal. Military weapons are already illegal. Did you just fall off the stupid train? You should probably learn about weapons and laws already in place before you flap your lips about them.
3914 2018-03-30 14:57:46 Exactly. So make it harder for people who give off red flags to get firearms, reduce legal magazine capacity, take bump stocks & other auto fire simulation accessories off market, raise purchase age to 21, ensure waiting period, make NICS reporting mandatory & BGC universal.
3915 2018-03-30 14:57:15 Anybody want to start a short ETF filled with these stocks?
3916 2018-03-30 14:57:00 I focus on both small and mid cap stocks. I like to go long, but I never swing. I do tend to hold my short swings  for a longer period of time, depending on the situation. Hope that helps.
3917 2018-03-30 14:56:50 Ofcourse raw tomatoes is obvious..but some muna thinks cabbage is no big deal so he never stocks on some days..
3918 2018-03-30 14:56:26 It actually is Trump’s fault because we’re under his administration and he did say he’s bring back jobs, etc. etc. Instead, we have many places filing for bankruptcy, stocks going down, and people losing jobs.
3919 2018-03-30 14:56:15 Given that we can't even do something about bump stocks... I guess so. He's too young & arrogant to shift to try to accomplish school safety any way that would help even 5%

3923 2018-03-30 14:52:33 I'm not sure of your particular trading style, but I use a @minervini - esque style of looking for stocks expanding out of volatility contractions.  I can send you some of those scans as well.
3924 2018-03-30 14:52:23 Thanks mate. Yeah... No big secret to it really... things MOVE in Fx land. No all day fades like stocks. In all that volatility I find it easier to play the odds than in stocks.
3925 2018-03-30 14:52:17 Past performance in Realty stocks is not a guarantee for the future.
3926 2018-03-30 14:51:59 Bump stocks were approved by Obama's ATF, FYI. Lawyers can argue whether that violates the NFA, the fact remains an AR-15 is a semi auto rifle no different from any other semi auto that's been around for more than 100 years. BTW define "basic rifle" and "basic handgun".
3927 2018-03-30 14:51:28 I hope Mark Zuckerberg heard me say, FUCK FACEBOOK! I never had an account and I know I never will! 

I hope Mark Zuckerberg heard me laughing as Facebook stocks fall!
3928 2018-03-30 14:48:10 They should add another question 

Do you think we are stupid

Don't be too pleased that the stocks are not showing a drop yet. Someone is renound for proping them up and then dumping them.
3929 2018-03-30 14:46:50 A selective ban is still a ban. It also is an easy slippery slope before people start suggesting insane things like banning AR-15s, bump stocks, silencers, large capacity magazines, short barrels, folding stocks etc. which end up being an even broader ban.
3930 2018-03-30 14:46:17 Delighted to hear how well Marcus looked after you Laura  MW
3931 2018-03-30 14:46:05 Remember that only 5% people earn money on stocks/cryptos the other 95% leaves with heavily loses, that is why u can earn much, you get money from the poor and trying to stay above the water!! then u are in 5%

3934 2018-03-30 14:43:08 It's quite lately as my stocks are trading sideways & it seems most the OTC is also trading sideways. This is the time to step back & focus on other things so as to not make bad decisions. Nothing that made you buy has changed. It's about patience now. $IFXY $OTTV $AMLH $HAON
3935 2018-03-30 14:43:05 Meanwhile stocks in tinfoil soar. Seriously, don't get suckered by the Russian government #kremlincriminals lie machine. On this I'm content to wait for the full evidence. All will out in good time. In more pressing news #brexit #CambridgeAnalytica #deathofdemocracy

3937 2018-03-30 14:42:03 By By Wayfair won't buy any of your cheap made products. Hope you go belly up and stocks fall sharply! Your just like Shitflix!
3938 2018-03-30 14:40:52 Correct. What I see on the horizon are BIG shortages. What I like is that good VA deposits are much harder to find than Lithium. I know people can get very tribal in stocks they hold. I think the bigger picture. I would sell AVL in a heartbeat if I saw better.  I just don't. imo
3939 2018-03-30 14:40:46 After reviewing my last 3-4Y of investing mistakes . I realized like most investors that I made mistake when I did not follow the process I laid down for myself { In hindsight this process was was according to what stocks suits my personality....]
3940 2018-03-30 14:40:33 The fact that thereare companies willing to let a child dictate their business practices tells me more about the companies than any financial report. Sold some stocks today.
3941 2018-03-30 14:40:32 I use @Wealthfront as my primary robo investor (25% growth past year) low risk.

I use @RobinhoodApp for investing in individual stocks I believe in (157% growth past year) high risk.

And then I use @acorns as a piggy bank with small amounts that adds up over months.
3942 2018-03-30 14:40:26 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
3943 2018-03-30 14:39:13 In trustable countries, I rule out « Mad Max » scenario, thus: 40% big names value stocks, 6mths spending in cash, 1mth spending in local gold coins, 10% physical gold/silver, 10% collectibles, 10% gold/silver mines, 20% agriculture & materials equities
3944 2018-03-30 14:38:51 Guys remember vanadium still only plays a small role in the EV revolution and majorly a big role in steel production. Stocks are reducing and there will be a market for both AVL and TNO to sell their products into. Fact is TNO with the size of resource is  very much undervalued
3945 2018-03-30 14:38:43 i need to buy tech startup stocks a.i. sector looking promising
3946 2018-03-30 14:38:25 I did. By the way. You guys see this as a competition. For me , I love your interest in Vanadium and I do not think it's a competition. Largo CEO stated we need a new Largo every year. I agree. This is about Vanadium, individual stocks are for all to choose. Do it well.

3950 2018-03-30 14:37:29 If you think that stocks can realistically go to infinity or zero, especially before you have time to call your broker, then I agree with you.  But otherwise? Not so much.
3951 2018-03-30 14:37:03 Bump stocks are essentially a novelty they cause the rifle to overheat and jam and inaccurate. So I could care less but “high capacity” magazines ban is dumb w/ right training you can be just as deadly with a 10 round as a 30 and the age limit where would you like me to start

3954 2018-03-30 14:36:14 Yes, the US has a vibrant, flourishing stock market. If by consequences, you mean a #DavidHogg hissy fit that requires 70 million+people to no longer patronize #Nutrish, #Expedia & all cos that pulled Fox ads, that will be for their boards to decide as stocks tank. #NFL
3955 2018-03-30 14:34:32 Guess Trump is trying to kill social media  ... you’re gonna see a mass exodus causing Tech stocks to crash... WHAAAAT 
3956 2018-03-30 14:33:58 value is judged by the price someone is willing to pay for it. These things could be overvalued (very likely), but so could uber, stocks and any other asset.
3957 2018-03-30 14:31:52 @MiniMartTalknow stocks Hail Caesar kits..... this is incredibly dangerous for me
3958 2018-03-30 14:31:26 How am I supposed to get rich if the market is closed? Common stocks should trade like cryptos - 24/7. I want people drunk trading options on their phones while they're waiting for their pizza after a night out.
3959 2018-03-30 14:31:01 Bump stocks quite often do more harm than good for the shooter. They greatly decrease accuracy and weapon handling and have a tendency to cause the weapon to jam, renderinh it useless until the jammed round is pulled from the weapon and its manually cycled.
3960 2018-03-30 14:30:39 Yeah man, rock out with your stocks out

3986 2018-03-30 14:28:47 We have a day off & the weekend free and so I'm back home in ATL. Spending the day doing finance stuff and going to see Mom tomorrow. But before I look at stocks and shares, a little me time...
3987 2018-03-30 14:28:15 Except in mass shootings high capacity mags arent common, even in that small demographic a high capacity mag ban or even semi-automatic rifle ban doesnt have any effect. We've tried them, they dont have any effect, neither did bump stocks but gun advocates conceded them.
3988 2018-03-30 14:27:56 Tip #3: im giving tips because im taking advantage of my state right now so others benefit from it. if u have a job or lots of $$$, invest in stocks or insurance. for future purposes. another alternative for cash income someday.

3990 2018-03-30 14:26:20 limited stocks obviously but completely run by myself.
3991 2018-03-30 14:26:00 finally found somewhere that stocks a gel with benzocaine, and now ma whole face is numb. better than pain
3992 2018-03-30 14:24:52 2.1 stocks number in soy yesterday.  What’s carryout going to be, 650? I know we all like to focus on friendly C acres but S a potential train wreck IMO
3993 2018-03-30 14:22:42 Sell your stocks and bonds.
3994 2018-03-30 14:21:51 The 2.1 billion stocks figure had no affect on your balance sheet?
3995 2018-03-30 14:20:54 Big issue with this as congress did not write any new bill or had Trump sign it into law. Bump Stocks were considered as a part or an accessory now a MG??
3996 2018-03-30 14:20:50 Also cattle farmers in Argentina were punished by the Kirchners, and the country’s stocks are just now recovering.
3997 2018-03-30 14:20:12 @ratechhotun would you know wher I could by a highflo in the Uxbridge area today or tomorrow can’t seem to find anyone that stocks it.
3998 2018-03-30 14:20:08 In this week's video....

Given bonds are "risky" today, is it still helpful to consider bonds as a defensive asset?   Is the ratio of stocks-to-bonds still relevant?
3999 2018-03-30 14:19:48 Thanks for the Lapoopieare cop out . No one is trying to repeal the 2a moron, we are trying to take assault weapons,high capacity magazines, and bump stocks off the streets
4000 2018-03-30 14:19:37 How are my statements contradictory? You said I got quiet after the bubble. Wasn’t on Twitter at the bubble. I said I’ve been in bitcoin for over a year and am still up. And am buying this correction. Yes I have traded for 15 years. Stocks, forex, etc. so where am I contradictory
4001 2018-03-30 14:19:15 They are my business when wacknuts buy high-capacity magazines, alter their weapons slightly with bump stocks to make them weapons of war, and then go on a rampage in a public place.  Your rights stop where my life is actively threatened, and vice versa.  Common sense gun laws.
4002 2018-03-30 14:18:50 But that won’t help anything. Ppl can still get their parents guns, ppl can buy past waiting periods by getting guns off the streets and bump stocks will just only be bought on the streets. Let’s talk about real reform that will actually help ppl.
4003 2018-03-30 14:18:36 If you could start again with Cash would you still have all of the stocks you currently hold in your portfolio ?
4004 2018-03-30 14:18:35 And then moved to ban bump stocks through federal regulation and signed Fix NICS into federal law.  So yeah, let states handle it...except here and there. There is no hard and fast rule on where these efforts should be focused.
4005 2018-03-30 14:18:33 The worst school mass shooting was committed using hand guns. Virginia Tech. Not an AR, no bump stocks... hand guns. @CNN @davidhogg111 @NRA

4009 2018-03-30 14:16:47 @SOFREPRadio Carefully tailored background checks are fine. AR bans are not. Bump stocks are kind of stupid but do we want the BATFE enforcing bans against them after Waco? Not so much.

4016 2018-03-30 14:14:33 Your comment got me thinking.   Crunched #’s this morning.  At most with 8888 Bbu of 3/1 stocks you could add 50-80 Mbu to ‘17-‘18 ending stocks.    A stocks # below 8800 would have been gas to the fire.

4018 2018-03-30 14:14:12 Your assault weapon is as Ms. Feinstein admitted yesterday is a "Model" of the military M-16 or M-4. Other firearms of the exact mechanism, of the AR-15, have been around since the 1930's. Only difference is they had wooden stocks.

4024 2018-03-30 14:12:15 No need to repeal the 2A.  Firearms Act of 1934 and Heller case both show that reasonable restrictions pass Constitutional muster.  Ban AR-15s, SCHV ammo, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks.  Leave intact the right of individuals to defend themselves, but limit their firepower.
4025 2018-03-30 14:10:47 It's called business incentives. States like mine in TN decided this because of the amount of jobs they created. You're just jealous of his success. Because of your tweet, stocks dropped & hurt middle class stockholders. Thx. Keep on MAGA idiot.

4028 2018-03-30 14:05:11 GDP 5% highest  in MENA region and highest since 2011 .. stocks market skyrocketing at 17500 highest in history .. I prefer living in a military dictatorship than living in chaos or living under ISIS or fucking Islamists
4029 2018-03-30 14:04:46 Maybe they have.  Are all Republicans pro AK15 assault rifles with multi-round clips or bump stocks?  I am neither Dem nor Republican but I do believe in stricter gun control laws.  As I said, 2nd will not be repealed.  Scare tactics on both sides.

4031 2018-03-30 14:04:04 The FACT is that nobody wants to take your guns away. What most  folks want is REASONABLE control requirements: 1) age 21 to buy weapons  2) ban bump stocks  3)  ban magazines over 15 rounds 4) ban all sales of assault  style weapons to civilians including gun shows, online, etc.

4039 2018-03-30 13:59:58 We want sensible gun regulations. No more selling guns at gun shows without background checks. Or via internet. Raise the age to 21 (like alcohol). Stop selling bump stocks and assault rifles.

4041 2018-03-30 13:59:25 It's not illegal, existing bump stocks are now just.....undocumented.
4042 2018-03-30 13:57:37 Let’s talk Gun Control policy:
I support the age requirement of 21
I support the no- bump stocks
I support fire arms training
I support the rights of legal Americans to own guns
I support the right of legal Americans to protect their life, their family in their homes

4048 2018-03-30 13:53:47 She described a proposed ban on bump stocks as "an inch." The group has talked about universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, limits on magazine capacity, and more funding for research. Those are the "mile." 

And you didn't have to wait long!
4049 2018-03-30 13:53:46 How can you not know what we want.  We want a ban on automatic and semi automatic weapon.  Ban on bump stocks.  Better background checks, that includes mental health issues.  And get rid of the gun show loopholes.

4068 2018-03-30 13:41:00 Closed Circuit to the @GOP and @FoxNews pablum eaters - banning bump-stocks and assault weapons does NOT infringe on your 2nd amendment rights.  The evil @NRA has suckered you into believing this.  Nowhere in the Constitution does it say what kind of weapons your can own.
4069 2018-03-30 13:40:56 What's wrong with @VoteRandyFine? Wanting to allow bump stocks, lower age to get guns? He's not pro-life. He's pro death

4073 2018-03-30 13:40:08 Our sell discipline came from a colleague that ran tax-managed funds that actively mined losses.  He said to us: "we sell when stocks are down 20%.  You know how many times I've revisited those later and seen a further 50% decline?  More times than you can count."
4074 2018-03-30 13:39:55 Help me understand why you think bump stocks should be protected under the 2nd amendment.
4075 2018-03-30 13:39:54 Bump stocks are already getting banned
So now I will quote Delaney Tarr

"Give us an inch, that bump stock ban and we will take that mile"

4122 2018-03-30 13:15:01 By the mid-seventies the distribution of new wealth had begun to shift out of wages and into stocks.  Unions were undercut and 401(k)'s replaced traditional company pensions. It's proven to be an incredibly effective way to exacerbate class differences inequality.

4133 2018-03-30 13:06:58 I understand on both sides.  the side that don't want bump stocks banned because they think it would be a gate way to banning guns.  Which I believe can happen if people carelessly make policy out of emotions not logic.

4137 2018-03-30 13:05:47 Your joking right? Let’s sell Opioids and bump stocks to the crips next. All with government approval of course. And more 500k speaking engagements and mm donations to the Clinton Foundation.
4138 2018-03-30 13:04:54 【portfolio】ポートフォリオ、金融資産の一覧(名詞) My portfolio consists of stocks and bonds. #toeic #英語 #英会話
4139 2018-03-30 13:03:29 The bar of governance quality has to be orders of magnitude higher because of the clear risk tradeoffs. Who are you going to sue if bad governance causes asset loss? Pretty straightforward for stocks. Not so much for blockchain systems.
4140 2018-03-30 13:03:24 Just got lectured by an old man to invest money in Sheetz stocks at 9 in the morning. Happy Friday.
4141 2018-03-30 13:02:49 1. Stocks in Asian countries display a mixed performance in the past few days due to an early close in many markets. #TGIF
4142 2018-03-30 13:02:38 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @jeffsessions Mr. President:  We elected you because we were tired of unreasonable gun control. Bump stocks were LEGALLY purchased.  Making criminals, California-style, of hundreds of thousands of Americans overnight is NOT why we elected you.
4143 2018-03-30 13:02:27 kumain ako ng marami. :'< gusto pa naman akong gutumin ng nanay ko. di rin siya naglalagay ng stocks ng pagkain dito kasi wala pang isang buwan ubos na daw :'<

4145 2018-03-30 13:00:37 -the thing is all of these are already in place with the exception of mag capacity because that would factor into no noticable changes in crimes. The NRA you despise so much even supported banning bump stocks, but you know you dont care about facts and logic.
4146 2018-03-30 13:00:34 Stocks go down. Stocks bounce back. I don't care as long as the dividends keep coming.
4147 2018-03-30 12:59:31 When u wanna sell some stocks but u forget the market is closed all day because of good Friday 
4148 2018-03-30 12:58:49 "I think universal background checks, banning bump stocks, reinstate law prohibiting the mentally ill access to firearms,  and limiting magazine size are sensible and are goal posts but the NRA is against ANYTHING put forward even when it is sensible." The only lib that has-
4149 2018-03-30 12:56:44 Shareholders are gonna sell their stocks. These companies are wrong to play politics especially when they use others money.
4150 2018-03-30 12:56:40 @davidhogg111 I encourage you to try to see all sides of argument.  Some students feel differently from you.  As retired teach., Consider 1st and 2nd amendments.  The founding fathers never anticipated or social media, nor bump stocks or semi automatics.  should we silence both?
4151 2018-03-30 12:56:25 Yes! And the workers of @amazon are the ones who suffer. They depend on their stocks as supplemental income. Just another example of @realdonaldtrump taking money out of the American workers pockets.
4152 2018-03-30 12:56:18 Banning bump stocks by changing the definition of “machine gun,” is a pretty big step.
4153 2018-03-30 12:53:48 Retailers do not eavde taxes. It is msme & sme manufacturers who eavde taxes to sell their products cheaper. Retailers get their rates f.o.r cheaper with the evasion. All the government needs to do is check the transporter + retail stocks to avoid evasion.
4154 2018-03-30 12:52:47 Just as our major companies have used this tax gift as a way to repurchase stocks—/. And still no investment in training for the jobs of the future.  Total BS
4155 2018-03-30 12:52:33 Economy & unemployment improved under previous president & continues DESPITE the current president, except now stocks react temporarily w/each of #45’s outbursts. That’s not good. People feel insecure. We’ll see if recovery can continue despite what GOP does legislatively.
4156 2018-03-30 12:52:24 LAS VEGAS:  23 legally purchased AR15s/guns, bump stocks, high cap mags. All background checks passed.  No mental illness history/no red flags. 10 Minutes. 58 dead, 851 wounded. (One of the wounded is now a paraplegic and her best friend is among the dead).
4157 2018-03-30 12:52:05 If you're a FlagTrader or OVI Private Club Member I've just added a stock into your "Stocks to Watch" List.  Feel free to comment on the setup! #OVI
4158 2018-03-30 12:52:04 what happened to the pairs that were set for online release, were they added to one of the store's stocks?
4159 2018-03-30 12:52:02 He DID buy assault rifles. 26 of them. And 1000s of rounds of ammo. And bump stocks.  All legally. And, so you say that not getting murdered at a concert is a privilege, but owning an assault rifle is a right? Where is your head?
4160 2018-03-30 12:50:46 Yes, erasing Obama’s radical Islamic agenda of *checks notes* legalizing bump stocks.
4161 2018-03-30 12:49:45 @Tom_Stocks good to meet you last night mate. Keep up the good work!
4162 2018-03-30 12:49:08 So they dont do background checks that include any time your mental stability has been questioned? The NRA itself didnt support outlawing bump stocks as they currently are? There are zero laws in place that both sides agreed on? And you accuse me of framing it as all or nothing.
4163 2018-03-30 12:49:07 Tons of stocks gapping up 5%+ this morning
4164 2018-03-30 12:46:54 you can’t bcan successful and not work hard, that’s just an oxymoron in itself. Warren buffet worked hard every day of his life. Don’t be silly and think he just invested in ‘the right stocks here or there’. He strategically invested based on knowledge he gained WORKING
4165 2018-03-30 12:46:13 Now back in Bristol in Kwik Fit. Despite being 40 mile away from where I had a blow out because no one stocks the tyres for a Glc amg!
4166 2018-03-30 12:46:03 As long as ‘responsible gun owners’, use 2A to argue for the right to own AR15s, high capacity magazines, bump stocks and background check loopholes & not give an inch... the only option is the 2nd amendment needs to go. Be careful, politics is a pendulum & it could happen!
4167 2018-03-30 12:44:11 @realDonaldTrump "Bump stocks are now under very strict control."  Reality:  The Justice Department has proposed a regulation that would ban the devices that allow semi-automatic firearms to fire more rapidly — but nothing has actually been enacted.
4168 2018-03-30 12:43:11 You purchased your binoculars

4172 2018-03-30 12:39:32 Since Malala is in Pakistan, Burnol is running out of stocks.
4173 2018-03-30 12:39:13 Absolutely, both for many individual stocks, and the main indexes. Further, now we have core breaks in $TSLA and $AMZN, both of which bode for a weak start in April.
4174 2018-03-30 12:38:53 You don't know. Hard times for #stocks market are coming with topping process on its way right now. Unfortunately, but #stocks and #crypto are correlated.
4175 2018-03-30 12:38:31 @ATT #BoycottIngraham I'm switching to Sprint & selling my AT&T stocks.
4176 2018-03-30 12:38:04 I support removal of AR-15 and bump stocks but the current movement needs to focus on all aspects. #supportmentalhealth
4177 2018-03-30 12:37:39 I know ur a big fan of this stock but with the euphoria over for bitcoin & other coins value is greatly reduced. If $OSTK self promotion is based on blockchain technology it’s a losing trade. Just look @ prices across the board from penny to the major stocks
4178 2018-03-30 12:37:13 Is #BTC topping scenario a reflection of what is coming for #stocks?
4179 2018-03-30 12:37:12 I know I will not be buying any product/service from these company's any longer. Stocks will fall/sales to follow. The @IngrahamAngle & @FoxNews is my only news source. I was a huge fan of @CNN in 80s 90s. I followed the Truth and made the switch. Try it you'll like it @FoxNews
4180 2018-03-30 12:36:55 Different states use different methods to conduct background checks but all states require a background check and in all states if you have been flagged as unstable within 5 to 7 years you cannot get a gun. Honestly bump stocks are useless and generally make it worse for gunman.

4188 2018-03-30 12:30:44 Ok I read this (well skimmed it so I didn’t vomit). Please tell me this was meant as a sarcastic parody and not how an adult really feels. By the way bump stocks and assault weapons were probably not on the streets when Ms. Ingraham was a child.

4191 2018-03-30 12:27:09 All the Marchers should vote Trump 2020. He has embraced almost every suggested item on their agenda. He's moving closer to banning bump stocks...
4192 2018-03-30 12:25:52 Por eso digo: tenemos un Doñarrosismo enfermante y nos tiene estancados. Si va a haber políticas públicas, hay que desbancar el "doñarrosismo". Ya con el "Porotismo", el mundo conceptual y político de Porota: en 8 años nos consumimos todos los stocks y quedamos al borde de HIPER.

There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。

4206 2018-03-30 12:10:56 lets talk about how Amazon fixes their stocks through employee issued restricted stock shares by firings. or how about the tracking the velocity of everything sold or bought to design investing profiles.
4207 2018-03-30 12:10:48 Quit watching Fox! Nobody Is going to get their guns taken away! That's BS ! Pure fear tactics. They want stricter gun laws. Longer waiting periods , assault style bumb stocks off streets!
4208 2018-03-30 12:10:46 If you have a long time horizon, be an owner: Buy a home, don’t rent. Favor stocks over bonds. Purchase a car, don’t lease.
4209 2018-03-30 12:10:31 With US #stocks finishing Q1 in the red, we looked at the quarterly returns of the S&P 500 during down years going back to 1958 (first full year of the S&P). Of the 12 years the S&P declined on a total return basis, Q1 was negative 83% of the time. Even still, the index has
4210 2018-03-30 12:09:50 That's the problem with America. The right is not willing to compromise. Personally I would accept the banning of AR-15 and weapons like it and bump stocks for what the right wants--mental health examination & background checks

4212 2018-03-30 12:09:43 Take the Vegas shooting, the guy had very easy access to several AR’s, bump stocks, high cap mags that he stockpiled & then slaughtered 50+ people.
So the only question is why.
Why did he do it?
Why is it so easy to access AR’s?
Why do people think they need AR’s?
4213 2018-03-30 12:07:45 SEC AND DOJ need to look into Trumps orbit to find out who is shorting the stocks of the companies he attacks. Follow the money.

4230 2018-03-30 11:57:11 Maybe.   

Maybe not. 

Bump stocks have been used in a mass shooting just once. 

And it is not clear it a ban would have stopped him. Just slowed him down slightly. 

Plus you can replicate the effect of a bump stock using your belt loop.

4286 2018-03-30 11:05:27 I think ~$6000 but I am more focused on the ratio between Gold and blue chip stocks (I plan to swap my gold for stocks once the POG in Euro is roughly equal with the nominal value of the German DAX). No idea when that might be, but I think within the next 5 years is reasonable.
4287 2018-03-30 11:04:34 We are people whom need jobs which companies provide. And offer stocks where we people can be part owners. Build personal wealth. Other people prefer to sit on their hands and complain. Point fingers.

Key to this is increased scrutiny of how #Facebook protects customer #data and Trump's opinions on #Amazon 'paying little or no tax'. New #regulations on data and #tax uncertainty will drive further volatility

4405 2018-03-30 08:50:34 Certainly but be aware of the weighting of each stock in the index! Some indexes around the world have a high concentration in a few stocks and this can add to risk when we have a "FB moment ".

4416 2018-03-30 08:36:44 As of now, I feel one should avoid banking stocks, because many frauds are still on the verge to come out. One can choose any other sector for investment.

4423 2018-03-30 08:32:11 Imo getting as many Eer and Eee up to 8% with minimal opt outs, compliantly, and AE becoming business as usual for the uk (esp Comms, re-enrolment and re-declaring compliance etc) is the first step.

Thereafter cost competition needs to take the lead for both Eer and Eee.

4431 2018-03-30 08:26:40 Forget about bump stocks, what about Trumps c..k?
4432 2018-03-30 08:25:58 bump stocks are a waste. Just a monster CNN painted after Vegas. Few people knew what they were before then, and they don't make a difference anyways. You probably mean well, but your anger is misguided in this case. Had the law been followed, the Florida shooting doesn't happen
4433 2018-03-30 08:24:52 True. In uk most pensions expect direct debit so pull money on receipt of data. Australian equivalents eg super choice manage the money too I think.

4456 2018-03-30 08:06:07 I'm still positive about stocks especially tech mega trend stocks. Nothing's changed ither than prices. always hardest to hold buy during these moments. Those that do are the ones that will be rewarded with big gains in the end.

4458 2018-03-30 08:03:09 I don’t speak for @sage or its data exchange- I understand there are teething problems. But I think we need to look at what it intends to do- even if it’s not there yet!

4516 2018-03-30 06:57:00 It's always great to use the Mi India apps too where everything is out of stock and Indian public is given dates to come on next flash sales (in-spite of having adequate stocks). Treating public like dogs. Must be very proud

4644 2018-03-30 05:10:27 Ummm it just depends on what's going on but I will out big portions into scalps on big board Intraday and swings. Smaller positions and use of capital on Sub penny stocks and lower penny stocks typically because of the lack of liquidity. Bottom line I will risk a lot if liquid
4645 2018-03-30 05:10:11 I'm saying in the not to distant future the only buyer of Chinese stocks will the communist government
4646 2018-03-30 05:10:02 Invest in stocks. Apple, Google, and Amazon are great options. Especially during certain times of the year.
4647 2018-03-30 05:09:54 He left the bank in tatters, outwardly, too !
4648 2018-03-30 05:09:44 @MorningstarInc hi. Im a customer from Australia. I have subscribed to the premium subscription but noticed I don't have access to any sell, hold, buy recommendations for Australian stocks. Also can I subscribe to the US version with the same account?
4649 2018-03-30 05:08:33 Are you KIDDING me?? There is NO WAY Democrats are going to give up our guns while the biggest TYRANT since King George III is running our country!! But we do want to ban semiautomatic rifles, large capacity clips, and bump stocks. #MAGA #VoteBlue #BanAssaultRifles #Impeach45
4650 2018-03-30 05:08:31 Netflix stocks are going to crash, sparking from politics.  All FANG stocks might take a bruising.
4651 2018-03-30 05:06:45 My criteria for entires are typically 1. major pull backs 2. Long based out stocks 3. Anticpaition of breakout momentum... exits I kind of just sell Into the momentum. 

Stop losses = first major support under my buy. Target = first major resistances

Lots of different variables
4652 2018-03-30 05:05:54 I own guns, former NRA member and I support ban on assault weapons, ban on bump stocks, red flag ban, no fly ban and universal background checks (no gun till you pass check unlike now).  I grew up in West, everyone knows you don't need assault rifles for hunting or protection.
4653 2018-03-30 05:05:04 Its earning and will pay off its debts in due course. Every Indian is an AI !!!
4654 2018-03-30 05:04:50 That was a great time to buy stocks?
4655 2018-03-30 05:00:38 Please allow me to partially correct myself.  KitKat is made and owned globally by Nestle, but is owned and made by Hershey Co. in the US.  Purchasing KitKat in the US does not enrich Nestle, at least directly.  It's difficult  to know what stocks of other companies are owned.
4656 2018-03-30 05:00:38 Thanks to the two of you for stripping innocent Americans of their rights by banning bump stocks and making possession off them a felony. Instead of going after Hillary, you choose to attack your own voters. I'd rather not vote than vote for you again.
4657 2018-03-30 05:00:06 When I got into stocks it was a bull market as well, got taught a hard lesson early.. A real quick eye opener that one was to learn as much as possible and DYOR
4658 2018-03-30 04:59:47 Great question..hmm I don't know how to answer this really. I guess a lot of it has to do with my entry on the specific ticker and a basic understanding of marker sentiment. I have a very good feel on how others will/or are currently perceiving the individual stocks. Intuition..
4659 2018-03-30 04:58:35 So do not worry, boycotting them will cost them a lot, watch their stocks drop. Such a novel idea by @TheDemocrats .  Maybe you can try for all the advertisers on Fox, it did not work on @seanhannity
4660 2018-03-30 04:58:12 I'll be watching the games tomorrow night.
4661 2018-03-30 04:57:16 Thank you @SheKnowsSports_  and @LaChinaRobinson  for having @CurtMillerWBB and I hang for a few minutes. 
4662 2018-03-30 04:53:13 Still up 7x from 2017. How's yer stocks doing? 

EDIT: downvotes eh? Stocks did not do so well I guess.

4664 2018-03-30 04:51:32 I am not on Amazon's side, but i sure as fuck am not on Trump's either. No president should mess with stocks like this
4665 2018-03-30 04:50:39 Having a publicly traded company has great rewards. But man, it also has high risks. For instance, whenever there's an issue, your stocks just plummet like you're bungee jumping.
4666 2018-03-30 04:45:03 Did he need bump stocks and assault weapons to defend his home?
4667 2018-03-30 04:42:35 Hmmm. Sentiment looks good. Sentiment drives stocks. I might have to pick up a few shares of MEDH...
4668 2018-03-30 04:41:49 Excited @RedmiIndia! Your phones are a complete package. How many stocks of RN5 and RN5 Pro today?
4669 2018-03-30 04:39:54 6k worth of stocks for not quitting.
4670 2018-03-30 04:35:28 Majority of Americans don’t own stocks.
4671 2018-03-30 04:34:59 It's pathetic how little this administration knows or cares about what an effective government should do. On the good side, stocks for the white hood production industry are WAY up under trump.
4672 2018-03-30 04:34:34 Almost everything he said at that pep rally today was misleading or an outright lie. 
From the Wall that isn't. To end of Bump Stocks, which also is not. To Roseanne, and his comment that it was all about us. The Liar in Chief knows that his base will believe anything he says.
4673 2018-03-30 04:34:30 This is excellent news. They also need to ban bump stocks, enact a Universal BG check, & raise age to buy to 21, with a 3-day waiting period. #VoteBlue2018
4674 2018-03-30 04:34:05 @TuckerCarlson Becoming familiar with the feel and operation of semi-automatic weapons will allow a firer to essentially become a "bump-stock". It can be learned. The problem with bump stocks and the ability to rapid-fire wastes ammunition.
4675 2018-03-30 04:33:11 He needs to clean up that income statement and balance sheet first. I bet the day $TSLA reports a net profit this stocks gaps up $100+
4676 2018-03-30 04:31:51 Stocks go up and down- I would do some due diligence and at least read up the article from @IncredibleTrade so you have a better understanding of the situation and where your putting your hrs earned $
4677 2018-03-30 04:31:42 Asia Markets: Asian stocks rise as many markets close for holiday
4678 2018-03-30 04:30:55 Still, we should outlaw bump stocks, high capacity magazines and hollow point bullets.
4679 2018-03-30 04:30:23 i also havent bought Six Sense album bcs i was quite broke i believe there are no stocks available at this time
4680 2018-03-30 04:29:19 They’re pretty damned close ... minus the 3 round burst I think only other difference was a small change in the firing pin. Also bump stocks &fully auto settings r a red herring, they actually reduce lethality in most situations. Even 3 round bursts waste ammo & reduce accuracy.
4681 2018-03-30 04:27:23 @JainNirmal hi sir..your team sold my stocks without my consent and without informing me. Client I'd RAVI6384.. bad experience
4682 2018-03-30 04:27:20 You think there will be a correction or you think it’s there to stay in the area it’s in now?
4683 2018-03-30 04:26:55 Yo... Is that coach???
4684 2018-03-30 04:26:15 With a handgun no.  At that distance a rifle always wins.  But many people would still have died if he used bolt action or pump action rifles.  Rate of fire isn't as fast as semi auto (not nearly as fast as bump stocks) but it is a lot faster than you think. Google Mad Minute
4685 2018-03-30 04:25:06 I know @PalisadesKid and @ronnie_dodge disagree with me on this, but  I am 100 percent for banning bump stocks, limiting magazine sizes, taxing ammunition at a higher rate like cigarettes, requiring IDs to buy ammunition, and limiting the number of firearms one can buy per month.
4686 2018-03-30 04:24:27 I also want you to understand David, that I am 100 percent for banning bump stocks, limiting magazine sizes, taxing ammunition at a higher rate like cigarettes, requiring IDs to buy ammunition, and limiting the number of firearms one can buy per month.

4690 2018-03-30 04:17:55 there already are. they are republicans though. hard pressed to find a Democrat politician under 50. yet, you still vote democrat. no, I'm not a GOP. just stating facts. let's let teens dictate our current reality. their wisdom is unparalleled. let's have dogs choose stocks 2.smh
4691 2018-03-30 04:16:45 Time for some patience boys. These stocks have been caught up in the shitacane that is the market this year.
4692 2018-03-30 04:16:30 Ask Dick Sporting Goods about the revenue they've lost since they decided to enter the political fray. If's not good, and shareholders ultimately decide what to do about it. We don't buy their stocks any longer.

4699 2018-03-30 04:08:04 They should never have been allowed to buy Whole Foods. That destroyed grocery stocks and caused 401K's to plummet. Its a disgusting abuse of power.
4700 2018-03-30 04:06:51 Only 52% of Americans own stock. Of those who stock, 10% of the richest own an average of $969000 in stocks, the next 40% owned an average of $132000 and the remaining 50% own just under $54000 in stock. So who is getting rich here? 48% of Americans don't benefit.
4701 2018-03-30 04:04:14 @Wayfair big mistake on your part . Pulling ads from Laura on the demands of a kid.       You lost a lot of customers.  Sorry but your stocks will fall. Ask Kierych coffee maker

4711 2018-03-30 03:48:47 Universal background checks, ban on bump stocks, restraining orders barring possession of firearms (with due process) for individuals judged to be a danger to the community (similar to domestic violence situations) and even a firearm ownership registry would be legal under  @2A
4712 2018-03-30 03:47:44 Right? Like didn’t even invest, but stocks, or anything of that nature
4713 2018-03-30 03:47:26 Very cool the collateralised pegged tech stocks now available on #bitshares DEX. Tesla, Apple, amazon etc. Good usage for a DEX
4714 2018-03-30 03:46:12 And how do you sort stocks for intraday.? Plese tell me. I will be very thankful.

4721 2018-03-30 03:43:23 i’m pro second amendment but  i completely disagree with this. fully automatic weapons were banned in the 80s and we still have semiauto rifles and bump stocks
4722 2018-03-30 03:41:29 it is a prayer room. I think people from any religion can go and pray.
4723 2018-03-30 03:41:27 Why is @realDonaldTrump infringing and over stepping his power on bump stocks/rate increasing devices if understands 2nd Amendment? #2A #GunRights
4724 2018-03-30 03:41:09 bump stocks arent practical for tactical encounters... only an idiot would use one to try and shoot people. and like I said... on an ar 15 they overheat the gun in 2 mags.
4725 2018-03-30 03:41:06 He's already "Gun Salesman of the Year" for the #NRA... Maybe this boycott will have the same effect and all these businesses will become Fortune 500 companies.

4727 2018-03-30 03:40:16 Yea bump stocks are different. I don't think they should be allowed through the FTA loophole. I have shot them and I don't see them being necessary for entertainment. If it werent for the vegas guy that had a lot more far deadlier guns ... no one would care about bump stocks.
4728 2018-03-30 03:38:45 I knew you were famous for something other than telling me which stocks to short sell.
4729 2018-03-30 03:38:19 Essentially the same thing, M4/M16 have selector switches for three round burst, that's the only notable difference, but with bump stocks it jumps right past three round burst to basically full auto.
4730 2018-03-30 03:38:13 Hope Anil Ambani & @reliancegroup going through bad times & with Biggest NPAs in corporates realizes this.

He cannot afford a slide in his stocks with Bad Days Now..
4731 2018-03-30 03:37:46 LOL, letter from the bank: "you'll only get 0.01% interest from now on. We know that's bad, but how about investing in stocks instead?"
4732 2018-03-30 03:36:35 I doubt these teenagers throwing temper tantrums buy a lot of pet food...but people who think like me do. My dogs think your food sucks anyway. Good luck with your sinking stocks. Somebody in marketing didn't think this through. SMH
4733 2018-03-30 03:32:52 Overnight -> Stocks rallied, dollar was flat, fixed income continued to rally. S&P-500 +1.4%, Nasdaq +1.6%. VIX tanked, down -12% at one point. WTI crude oil +0.9% to $64.95/bbl. Volumes were subdued in all markets ahead of a long weekend. Most markets are closed today. #Markets
4734 2018-03-30 03:30:36 Fed funds rate now back to around 0% in real terms which is about right given the deep seated structural changes in the economy in the aftermath of the GFC

4748 2018-03-30 03:17:45 If you were as smart as your smartass tweet...you'd know anyone with a clue could build a homemade rifle.  You sound like Trump, "lets ban bump stocks", they can be made at home for 12 bucks lol. A suppressor is about 4 bucks...unless you feel like registering it.  #Freedom
4749 2018-03-30 03:17:45 Here’s an idea: crowdsourcing puts on stocks of companies that bow to little shits like @davidhogg111, and/or dumping shares.
4750 2018-03-30 03:17:26 I’m waiting to see how their stocks fair tomorrow.
4751 2018-03-30 03:16:32 BS. The only gun reform you lot want is banning, period. Don't try and pretend that isn't your aim, because we can see through your rhetoric. What was it blondie said, if we get they give an inch on the bump stocks, we'll take a mile? You're not fooling anyone on your goal.
4752 2018-03-30 03:15:13 It's just not my style. The action on cryptos is exactly everything I don't like in stocks.  All slow grinds. I don't have the patience for that.

4755 2018-03-30 03:13:02 One more thing....Trump outlawed bump stocks (which is wrong) & tried to raise the age to 21 to buy guns. Plus he is trying to put funding towards protecting schools. That doesn’t sound like a President that does not care.
4756 2018-03-30 03:11:53 Barrel shrouds ... sputter, sputter ... pistol stocks ...  sputter, sputter ..l matte black finish ... sputter, sputter ... bayonet mounts ... skull & crossbones decals ... SCARY-looking weapons, I tell you!
4757 2018-03-30 03:09:52 You've got it wrong moron. As a liberal and a gun owner I have no desire to repeal the 2nd. I want common sense gun regs. We don't need combat weapons in our society. We need universal background checks and a ban on high capacity mags and bump stocks. Is that too much?
4758 2018-03-30 03:09:37 I watched it daily for a month straight.  It was not daytradable at all.  I kept trying to find reasons to jump and never did.  I made almost 100K in the past 3 weeks trading stocks for <3 hrs/day on avg.  I'm content with that.  More power to you if you got the patience for it.
4759 2018-03-30 03:09:37 So lets tell these people in the Great State of Ohio the TRUTH. The building of the wall has not started, you LIED to them. Also you have not banned bump stocks, this is another LIE. You have no problem LYING to people to save your sorry ass from embarrassment.
4760 2018-03-30 03:09:14 Right. The one specific weapon at the center of the heartache. That due to bump stocks it can be made auto. Yet, without bumps, it does fires off to close to auto. You can understand the their fear right?

4765 2018-03-30 03:07:09 Wtf whole morning wasted sorting out some god damn useless inventory listing. Gave me a listing which includes customers stocks and made me sort them out manually. ML point checked.
4766 2018-03-30 03:06:58 my goal this weekend is to get at least one solid pic for the gram so i can bump my stocks a bit.
4767 2018-03-30 03:06:20 It is banning ASSAULT RIFLES. The ones made for killing PEOPLE. Additionally, unnecessary things like extended clips, bump stocks, etc. Stricter gun buying requirements. Universal background checks. Close the private sale loophole. Sensible gun control.
4768 2018-03-30 03:05:44 I am almost 100% sure that $FB can grow faster than consumer staples over any time frame.  It’s a monopoly with a gigantic addressable market.  Much better than Coke, Hershey, beer stocks.  Growth is worth paying for.
4769 2018-03-30 03:03:15 I’m not necessarily saying I agree with it. But it’s far and away the best argument for banning  bump stocks. “Why do you need it” is not a valid argument.
4770 2018-03-30 03:03:12 You know what, investors?  Get out of the stock market.  Right now, I see all the danger that we're facing, so clearly.  We have a POTUS who will, on a whim, decide he doesn't like a certain company, and he deliberately tanks their stock. Get out of stocks, and do it soon.
4771 2018-03-30 03:03:04 "#2. REDUCE the ability to obtain assault rifles and ultimately ban bump stocks."

You're spending this energy on reducing rifles that are used in less than 2% of ALL crimes, and a ban on bump stocks that have been used in a grand total amount of 1 crime.  Makes sense.
4772 2018-03-30 03:01:38 Yeah it moves too damn slow for my taste.  I saw several of my friends stay awake for 36 hours straight, losing countless hours of sleep, trying to catch the bottom bounce on cryptos which is something that happens in seconds on stocks.  No thanks.
4773 2018-03-30 03:01:16 Basically, the NRA vision is not a good one in our minds.I don't mean she specifically came out against those kids.Not tightening up laws for gun shows, not wanting bump stocks banned and not wanting to raise the age.
No need to argue and get so angry. We all have right to choose
4774 2018-03-30 03:00:25 No background check at gun shows or in person to person sales. That's a HUGE problem, and bump stocks aren't being banned yet nationally. Trump said something about it and did nothing, as usual. (I'm catching up in one tweet. Haha.)
4775 2018-03-30 03:00:20 Companies are raising wages and giving bonuses. Mine has. I also own stocks and dividends have increased already. The tax cuts will help lower earners now that the standard deduction has doubled. The economy is clearly better.
4776 2018-03-30 02:59:43 Now if you think the court is wrong (which I assume in this case you don’t), that’s a whole nother discussion but based on the current law of the land that is the best argument for banning bump stocks. “Why do you need it” isn’t a good argument.

4778 2018-03-30 02:58:35 Do you trade penny stocks only? And options too
4779 2018-03-30 02:58:09 1st is the guy in Nevada would have used a hunting rifle, many more would have been killed. Bump stocks are highly inaccurate.

2nd Glocks don’t take clips.

3rd whats your solution to this problem?
4780 2018-03-30 02:57:39 Gun owner for over 30 years and CC in NY. If we lose 2A it'll be because of the NRA & the black gun cult, not in spite of them. Universal background checks, ban bump stocks, 5 rd max rifle mag, no gun show/private sales, permits for handguns.
4781 2018-03-30 02:56:44 @AskWoodforest are CROOKS!!! They make errors and bank glitches and blame the customer!!! THey had a customer service rep call me a liar!!Are you serious??? I hope y’all stocks go down!!!!!
4782 2018-03-30 02:56:31 Right, anyone else remember the stock crash that kicked off the recession? I do, bought stocks. Eventually sold them for textbook money.

Bush was in office.
4783 2018-03-30 02:56:18 What are you blabbering about?....I don't need an education on bump stocks.....or...on what's now being sold to replace it.
4784 2018-03-30 02:56:14 I’m not saying the courts are always right, or that the courts should be our moral arbiters. What I am saying is that if we can agree that the court ruled automatic weapons are illegal which they did, in D.C. vs Heller, then that would be a fair argument to ban bump stocks...
4785 2018-03-30 02:56:09 I'm a law-abiding gun owner and NRA Life Member who supports the Parkland teens calls to re-impose the assault weapon ban, ban bump stocks, & strengthen checks to prevent criminals & mentally ill from getting guns: The NRA USED to support the latter. Nobody's trying to repeal 2A.
4786 2018-03-30 02:54:49 Just told my sister that starting next month she was going to be working for me at 8 an hour cash Monday through Thursday mornings helping me with stocks and my mom would quit her job lol. Very hard to do but I think I'm able to manifest that! Determined baby!

4788 2018-03-30 02:53:24 And their stocks are going down, I hear.
4789 2018-03-30 02:52:58 Somebody tell evnu quit talking about stocks
4790 2018-03-30 02:52:54 Lol no thats a picture of something that was already there. The actual building of the wall has not begain
 Just like those bump stocks havent been banned yet. They still have 90 days to be voted on before becoming a law.
4791 2018-03-30 02:52:43 I never said I was afraid of anything. You need to read more carefully. As for others, Twitter isn't reserved solely for "the market."  Lots of people use twitter who aren't involved in stocks including DMD families... So spreading lies is not just about stock movements
4792 2018-03-30 02:52:30 I watched & didn't see them say she was a murderer.I believe they think the NRA takes a stance that is too lenient thus causing gun deaths in the USA.Nobody said these killers are NRA members. They are saying the NRA is supportive of things like bump stocks and gun show loopholes
4793 2018-03-30 02:51:54 Did I say I owned a bump stock? No. Do I hunt squirrels with an AR? No (I use a .22 long rifle).
Bump stocks are novelties for people who don't know how to bump fire with just their thumb. They're useless for anyone desiring accuracy.

4797 2018-03-30 02:49:50 @realDonaldTrump If you ban bump stocks, people will simply 3D print them. Ban the rapid repeat, M4, modern sporting rifles, or you've done nothing.
4798 2018-03-30 02:48:40 Just returned from vacation and to be honest I didn’t even check what my 2 stocks were doing. Those stocks are $rjdg $libe both I’m expecting to have a good news posted next week. I’m a huge fan of $RJDG and I see it as a potential long hold, $LIBE just going to feel it out.
4799 2018-03-30 02:48:37 .@realDonaldTrump  You recently stated that you got rid of bump stocks....once again Spanky, you lie.  They are still legal.  Your sad little base may hang on your every word but the rest of us,  with a working brain,  laugh at you.

4816 2018-03-30 02:40:55 @realDonaldTrump the ATF can not create law! You of all people should know this. Do not ban bump stocks, allow the ATF to create law or sign any legislation into law regarding rate increasing devices. Do your homework YOURSELF! #pewpew #Merica #freedom #DontTreadOnMe @GunOwners
4817 2018-03-30 02:40:28 Don't give one in on gun rights. Democrats will never vote for you anyway. No ban on bump stocks. Don't give even one inch
4818 2018-03-30 02:40:14 If a mentally ill, struggling, bullied, kid wanted to proceed in a school shooting, he would get his hands on a gun regardless of a ban. It will not stop it. Ever heard of the black market? Where they use crypto currency? The thing skyrocketing in stocks?
4819 2018-03-30 02:39:53 "What is the point of bump stocks being legal?" One word- Freedom. 
Is there a use for them or a reason for them to exist? Maybe / Maybe not. Yet if we let them take those away, what is next? That is how they get you. A little at a time.
4820 2018-03-30 02:38:12 Because this whole discussion with you responding to one of the founders of the movement saying the second amendment needed to be amended. If you are not part of the movement then my bad, but I would just let you know that you don’t need to “amend” 2A to ban bump stocks.
4821 2018-03-30 02:37:39 Quite well.  Many companies not selling bump stocks or assault weapons.  These stores sales, like Dicks, have gone up.
4822 2018-03-30 02:35:19 We MUST reduce the ability to obtain assault weapons and ban bump stocks! We question the need to have assault weapons in everyday society, as their only practical use is for war.

4825 2018-03-30 02:33:14 Economy is up....stocks are up....paychecks are a bit bigger....the coalition for black women in science received a hefty fund check.....Hispanics have more help than ever before. And those are only a few things....what more do you want in a year?
4826 2018-03-30 02:32:05 Yea? I went short at $340 and the stocks at $260. Sure sounds like you didn’t buy the stock at $25 and sounds more like you bought over $260. I’m making money fanboy and you are kissing Elon’s butthole.
4827 2018-03-30 02:30:58 So, I politely furnished the guy w. basic gun categories and pointed him to a research area- the dude blocks me!!  I even said as a conservative I was against bump stocks.  Then twitter didn't allow me to see my original response 'cause there were "too many responses".  WTAF 
4828 2018-03-30 02:30:52 Not saying all would be punished. But, there’s been a law since 1930’s to keep automatics out of civilian hands. Bump stocks turn semi’s into auto’s. But, all do need to abide by the law already established.

4837 2018-03-30 02:26:10 I have no position myself.  Put out the info yesterday showing the possibility of $WMT and other retail stocks like $M $GPS expectating that they could trade higher. They in fact did the next day.  $WMT FWIW After hours price is above yesterday's closing price of $87.77

4841 2018-03-30 02:23:26 Can wait to buy some stocks for my team cause we getting matching drop tops after that 
4842 2018-03-30 02:22:54 AR15s & bump stocks should not be considered “arms”.
They should be military weapons.
Just as armor piercing bullets, grenade launchers, gatlin guns, & bombs are not for civilian use.
All other guns ok. I have 2 myself. 
But when a cops vest cant stop it- civvys shouldn’t have it
4843 2018-03-30 02:20:19 Are you saying there is a federal backgound check that I can't get around by going to private dealer? Like at a gun show or over the internet? Do me a favor don't lie about it.Automatics was true until bump stocks were created&then sold to those who couldn't machine it themselves
4844 2018-03-30 02:19:55 This is false.
If that’s what it meant-“well equipped & trained” ...
A) it would be mandatory to provide the arms to be well equipped
B) training would be supplied
I’m not arguing semantics & u  know it. The real issue is classification of this particular gun & bump stocks

4849 2018-03-30 02:16:30 Same reason they want to ban bump stocks. Death by a thousand cuts.
4850 2018-03-30 02:15:53 Bump stocks are not a gun, they are an accessory and do NOT make the gun fire automatic. 
Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people at Virginia Tech, the deadliest school shooting ever, with a Glock 19 and a Walther P22, both are pistols. 

You don't know shit about guns.

4860 2018-03-30 02:05:32 Except for bump stocks and anything irrationally related to them.
4861 2018-03-30 02:05:10 It’s funny people talk about $BTC bubble, meanwhile there have been bubbles in pot stocks again, some biotech’s, and some more r bubbling right now, could go higher but, $SGMO 4 example, prolly splat. It’s markets, it happens. I’m not sure why people r surprised or mad.
4862 2018-03-30 02:04:57 No I don't want to ban handguns, and I'll never give mine up and neither will anybody I know.  We're not here to abolish the 2nd amendment.  I just want my grandkids safer at school without AR-15's with bump stocks and clips that hold more than 8-10 rounds.
4863 2018-03-30 02:04:56 You are WRONG, you are LYING, this is absolutely FAKE NEWS. People are marching and advocating for reforms including banning weapons like AR15’s, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, requiring universal background checks, and closing gun show loopholes #LiarLiar
4864 2018-03-30 02:04:25 The points toward gun reform have been widely discussed and I'm sure you know them, but here you go anyway:
1 Curb the sale of large magazines
2 Make bump stocks illegal
3 Increase background checks
4 Make AR-15 style weapons harder to purchase.
5 Fund gvmt research into guns
4865 2018-03-30 02:03:57 I will give you a little education Bump stocks were approved by the Obama Administration!!

There is no need for gun control ! It’s people control , pharmaceutical control and most of all good paying jobs helps crime rate

I nor anyone I know would own one. You don't need a bump stock to bump fire a gun. It's just a gimmick.

4878 2018-03-30 01:58:13 The comments were today, right? 
AMNZ was up almost $16 

You guys should subscribe to a newspaper that covers stocks
4879 2018-03-30 01:54:24 no, i was just saying it was easy to be an expert when it was going up.  not saying crypto = RE or stocks, but there are lots of stock "experts" in bull markets.
4880 2018-03-30 01:53:08 This HODL s*** is just that, s***.  Oil, gold, stocks don’t whipsaw back and forth with such velocity like Bitcoin does.  I mean this is like gambling or playing options on stocks, rocket up, rocket down.  NOT A REAL INVESTMENT.  PERIOD.   #bitcoin #investments
4881 2018-03-30 01:52:45 Sorry! The offer lasts until the stocks lasts with the seller, you'll have to check out as soon as the product is added to cart. Request your understanding.
4882 2018-03-30 01:52:04 Maybe the right stocks. But beware of market chop.
4883 2018-03-30 01:50:20 Banning bump stocks. Oh wait, he Neverminded on that one in about 18 hours.
4884 2018-03-30 01:49:58 ay man, remember kicking back most nights watching CGP s1 shit was insane man. I remember putting off going out just to watch stocks team play. actual miss it
4885 2018-03-30 01:47:53 Your buddy Obama is the one who legalized bump stocks which make semi automatic rifles automatic. If you really think Trump is a tyrant, why in the world would you want to let him confiscate your guns? Oh as long as your armed guards get to keep theirs the rest of us can fend?
4886 2018-03-30 01:47:46 It was easy to be an expert when all it did was go up.  no different with stocks and real estate.
4887 2018-03-30 01:47:32 Well, arms manufacturers stocks go up after every mass shooting so they MAY be really really okay with them continuing to happen
4888 2018-03-30 01:46:54 Gym, shower,laundry, stocks, and The Weeknd’s album seems like a good end to the day
4889 2018-03-30 01:46:12 So how are bump stocks legal?  I own guns. I believe in the right to own guns. My issue is...if a person walks into a school with a handgun and a 30-30 he will inflict much less damage than an AR-15 with bump and 30 clip rounds!  So if it’s illegal, how does this happen?
4890 2018-03-30 01:46:10 Aks and clf cheap steel stocks
4891 2018-03-30 01:45:28 Investors are loosing confidence in the industry. All are dumping their bank stocks and exiting their positions.

I think we will see a huge sell-off in this space again and will add more weakness to the market.
4892 2018-03-30 01:44:44 Bump Stocks, check, Mentally ill, check (with due process), Domestic violence, check (with due process),  but making AR's illegals is just the start of a gun grab....unnecessary and illogical, and a part of the liberal lie
4893 2018-03-30 01:43:02 ASCENDANT FACTION stocks rallying
4894 2018-03-30 01:42:36 *Facebook stocks be like*
4895 2018-03-30 01:42:19 This kid's tweet is why Republicans don't want to make voting easier. It could be an automatic part of our lives as citizens in a democracy. Imagine if we could vote from an app on our phones? We can use apps to bank & buy stocks but we can't vote for a dog catcher w/ an app.
4896 2018-03-30 01:41:50 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
4897 2018-03-30 01:41:24 .@Expedia...... I know I am only one but of many and you will no longer receive any business of ours ever again.
I also plan on reviewing my portfolio of stocks & bonds and anything that is invested in your company will be sold immediately.
4898 2018-03-30 01:39:53 Yeah duh... If it never dropped nobody would invest. You obviously dont buy stocks.
4899 2018-03-30 01:39:49 Stocktake Sale!! Everything must GO! Hurry while Stocks Last!
4900 2018-03-30 01:39:29 “I support banning bump stocks” says CMR
4901 2018-03-30 01:35:44 It’s time to short some stocks!
4902 2018-03-30 01:35:17 And maybe gun stocks!!
4903 2018-03-30 01:34:49 If the radical right wanted to discuss IDEAS, they would be honest about how universal background checks, banning bump stocks, and raising buying age is not “taking away guns from good gun owners.” That doesn’t mobilize the base. Easier to fear monger and attack the kids.
4904 2018-03-30 01:33:13 Considering that we tightened  up the background checks and got rid of the bump stocks ...what else is he fighting for...He’s still on TV fighting for something...He says he wants the guns to go
4905 2018-03-30 01:32:42 @rsluymer hi rob you do terrific work, are there any tech stocks which warrant a buy on your radar sir?
4906 2018-03-30 01:31:55 I know! Ugh. But ending stocks largest in history. Impossible for me to be bullish. Time will tell.
4907 2018-03-30 01:31:07 Any word on reasonable bipartisan gun control measures coming out of your office?  How about some funding for research into gun violence?  Banning bump stocks?
4908 2018-03-30 01:30:03 All America must boycott these companies that boycott conservatives free speech so they finally get the message in their earnings quarterly reports  when their stocks go down the board gets pissed off and removes the CEO's
4909 2018-03-30 01:29:35 And they made a mistake. One they will see in their sales. @netflix is already feeling the burn. @TripAdvisor and @Nestle will see it soon. We already dropped netflix. Lol. Look at their stocks, for playing politics. GG. We're tired of this crap. #MAGA #BoycottNetflix
4910 2018-03-30 01:27:56 Supply side of today’s grain report was exceptionally bearish. Acreage side was bullish with USDA n yours truly n everyone is also wrong.
But history shows stocks determine values not acreage. I doubt theres even a spit left of upside. Still not bullish!
4911 2018-03-30 01:26:59 Pls remember i and the students are not against u but want America to fix mass shootings. No matter what ANYONE says! After! Vegas NRA was 4 a ban on bump stocks. like every other time after nothing different was done. Cornyn helped pass law this week & expand background 
4912 2018-03-30 01:25:48 Forget Technology stocks; popcorn stocks could go through the roof!
4913 2018-03-30 01:25:25 Doing weekly investment tally, a day early since markets closed for Good Friday, down overall since Bitcoins major drop, but stocks and mutual funds up on the week, where will Bitcoin go in quarter 2 of 2018?
4914 2018-03-30 01:24:38 The NRA and gun makers should be lobbying for gun laws to make guns safer for all of us, but instead you pay the politicians to vote against the current gun laws, being applied consistently.  Why does the NRA not want the gun show loop hole closed, or make bump stocks illegal?
4915 2018-03-30 01:23:57 FANG stocks' bite has U.S. fund managers looking for alternatives @Alexa_Banal
4916 2018-03-30 01:23:12 #trading #bitcoin #f&o

The crash of Bitcoin after futures was introduced is one of the examples to show that true price discovery happens ONLY when traders can take the short side along with the long side. 

In India stock L&B should be robust or more stocks brought into f&o!
4917 2018-03-30 01:22:53 Exactly, they are only using the term assault weapons which leave a very broad range. I for 1 own an AR-15 and it does not fire any faster than my pistol. But if they want to ban altering mechanisms such as bump stocks go for it
4918 2018-03-30 01:21:58 Fruity pebbles will make it online only if stocks left ?? What time approximatively ?
4919 2018-03-30 01:20:41 Probably a good thing.  Could you imagine the panic if the INDU moved like FAANG did!  Health care costs would rise with all the sudden heart attacks!  At least you could buy some pharma stocks! 
4920 2018-03-30 01:20:22 All my stocks are going to shit!!
4921 2018-03-30 01:19:48 Bump stocks were used in ONE mass shooting. If you want to save people on things that are killing people everyday, why not go for handguns?
And the democrats will not compromise...you’ve got your head in the clouds if you think they’re going to compromise.

4932 2018-03-30 01:11:03 stocks were good today tho so it’s okei
4933 2018-03-30 01:10:35 we want a better ban that doesn’t leave holes in our defense against gun violence...ban all high capacity magazines, bump stocks, universal background checks, closing gun show loophole...
4934 2018-03-30 01:10:30 Yeah, I’ll enjoy watching their stocks decline when conservatives boycott them. Lmao.
4935 2018-03-30 01:10:07 Today was Mostly just a Short-Covering Rally ahead of the Long Weekend. Most Stocks & Indexes—Sold off in the last Hour. Return to Selling—Looks likely for Monday. We’ll see. #MarketTimer

4941 2018-03-30 01:07:47 El capitalismo siglo XXI en el ámbito sanitario es de lo más extremo. Recoger grandes beneficios a costa de la salud de los ciudadanos. Los excedentes a venderlos a países emergentes o del tercer mundo a precios desorbitados, y los países emisores sin stocks. 
¿Quién frena esto?

4944 2018-03-30 01:05:42 Ease of access to weapons and access to military grade weapons. High capacity magazines and accessories like bump stocks.
4945 2018-03-30 01:05:14 Wait for support to be created before partaking. Don't try to be the support creator, it usually ends in agony. #stocks #trading
4946 2018-03-30 01:05:00 Expect the best..... U will receive the same.
U must know that Bitcoin is still not at one year low.... When stocks starts to fall it goes for multi year low. 
It's a financial market which has been described as Hiper volatile!
Just chill and relax with ur family!
4947 2018-03-30 01:04:54 The courts have already ruled that the AR used in that school shooting is not covered by the Second Amendment. 
And making bump stocks illegal and raising age for purchase of weapons and making sure that mentally ill people with domestic violence, etc. don't get guns.
4948 2018-03-30 01:04:08 @DavidDobrik Did you ever sell those Tesla Stocks?
4949 2018-03-30 01:04:07 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
4950 2018-03-30 01:02:40 And uh yeah, Wall Street definitely because in case you haven’t noticed it’s doing worse now then it has in over a decade. It’s been in damn near free fall and had to correct itself twice in the last year. Investors pulling out - only CEOS buying stocks - sounds like 2008.

4955 2018-03-30 00:59:52 Your reckless attacks of companies run by people you don’t like is throwing stocks into big losses. This costs the average American with money in these stocks because of your stupid feuds.

4972 2018-03-30 00:48:30 What's your stand on #GunControl ? Assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines have to go. The Second Amendment is in question.
4973 2018-03-30 00:48:05 痩せなさい
4974 2018-03-30 00:47:37 I want to see their stocks go drop lower than that Hogg's gonads.
4975 2018-03-30 00:47:31 Happy?
4976 2018-03-30 00:47:31 Bump stocks, AR's, then pistols it's just steps in their chiseling away the 2nd.
4977 2018-03-30 00:47:25 And that's the true reason why they want to ban bump fire stocks even though they reduce accuracy but their firing rate is nothing like a fully automatic and regardless The Narrative fully automatic is what was used by ISIS in Vegas
4978 2018-03-30 00:47:23 $PKG is one of my fav stocks check my tweets lol, I emailed the CEO earlier today. He said trying to get financials out ASAP they could come any day. And said I’d be happy with the work they’re doing in the future. 2018 is gonna be great for this stock

4982 2018-03-30 00:44:54 I'm sure the 10 stocks you owned, wont make a huge dent in their earnings.
4983 2018-03-30 00:44:46 Stocks rallied on Thursday as President Donald Trump touted U.S. economic gains and a plan to boost spending on infrastructure.
4984 2018-03-30 00:40:49 You're saying you're ready to kill if   bump stocks become illegal?AK 47 becomes illegal?Or kill if they raise age to 21?You willing to kill so gun shows can continue to sell guns w/out background checks?Those are common sense reforms but you'd kill for them?
4985 2018-03-30 00:40:13 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
4986 2018-03-30 00:39:28 1. One of those things alone does not a bump stock make. Modifying guns is illegal in many ways already.
2. Ban assault rifles, bump stocks, extended clips. No one needs to own these that aren't military or police.
3. Supreme Court established abortion rights in Roe v Wade.
4987 2018-03-30 00:39:17 I'm not a huge fan of the NRA but the Second Amendment wasn't about hunting it was about our RIGHT to keeping bear arms period .  I also think bump stocks are stupid range toys and just because I don't use one doesn't mean I want them banned.

4989 2018-03-30 00:37:48 Amazing! Are you considering including international (subnational) geographies and stocks?
4990 2018-03-30 00:35:36 you are having trouble with a stock exchange like yobit How do you think to enter the other 2 big stocks you do not have the money to get into those two stocks you are collecting help without money how to get you to those two stock markets.
4991 2018-03-30 00:35:21 Bump stocks are going to be illegal so law is law if they are illegal, law biding gun owners will follow the law. Just like we have always done.
4992 2018-03-30 00:35:05 That's the problem. This kind of rhetoric just hardens people. Nobody rational believes that selling bump stocks is a good thing. The problem is that if you are on the pro gun rights side you have seen first hand what happens and you aren't going to give an inch in this climate.
4993 2018-03-30 00:34:35 We don't want it repealed we just want what Japan has background checks mental health test target accuracy retest every few months register your guns no bump stocks no weapons of mass murder

4995 2018-03-30 00:33:11 Yo Democrats, wondering why you didn't support buying back bump stocks & large cap. Magazines?  How else will we get them out of circulations? I'm sure there's more to it.  #VTpoli @briancinavt @JKrowinski @marymsull

4998 2018-03-30 00:31:56 They are banned, you have to do a background check, tax stamps ($200 each), and some other bureaucratic nonsense, then you can pay around $10,000-$20,000 for a select fire weapon.  Bump stocks are a waste, but I’m not here to tell people what they can’t have.

5002 2018-03-30 00:29:28 Ban Lazy Susans. With one of these, a gunman can spin around and around effortlessly spraying the entire area in a 360° circle of death. We find these in just as many shooting scenes as bump stocks.
5003 2018-03-30 00:29:21 Go trying buying a ar15 and tell me how easy it isn't lol and bump stocks are nothing more then a rubber band. So you best banned those runner bands. Or they will get you. Hammers,knifes,cars,and cell phones cause death, and drinking! Ban all those things! You don't care abt livs
5004 2018-03-30 00:28:43 NAZISM at its best. Sorry. TRUMPISM at its best/worst. Who the hell will want to visit the US now??? I wouldn't. Hope the tourism industry is listening. Your hotel stocks just took a hit.
5005 2018-03-30 00:28:09 No buy at this time. It fits my technicals, but there are so many stocks near or just above the 200d right now that I like better.

5008 2018-03-30 00:25:35 old Puritan stocks are dead, Mayflower is a white privilege, only Sarah Palin believes in the Boston Tea Party, diversity is divisive 
5009 2018-03-30 00:25:13 Are you freaking kidding me! @Nutrish you are on the wrong end of the sh*t stick! David Hogg is nothing but an uneducated spoiled brat. You pull your advertisement from #LauraIngraham show, you WILL see a major drop in your stocks. That's a fact not a whine!!

5012 2018-03-30 00:23:59 Hey how come none of those people who don’t understand what gun control means/ nazis haven’t said anything about trump saying he wants to ban bump stocks and raise the age to purchase a gun to 21?? Hmm interesting

I’ll take a coach who makes changes
5015 2018-03-30 00:21:12 Why do companies always cop-out, it only hurts thier stocks more.
5016 2018-03-30 00:21:07 1. Bump stocks are more than rubber bands.
2. Availability of assault rifles is the problem. Availability in all forms. You just proved my point.
3. You don't have a right to tell women what they can do with their bodies. You cannot force your religion on others.
4. Grow up.
5017 2018-03-30 00:21:07 Hey Mr. Judicial Watch.   Why don't you question the behavior of our President for picking and choosing businesses which is against the law.  Did you read Trumps tweet about Amazon Again!!  Sent the stocks tumbling.   He needs to be stopped.

5022 2018-03-30 00:18:06 Banning bump stocks doesn't do a dam thing! You do know a rubber band does the same thing right? You gonna ban those? How did the Maryland shooter get a gun? He was 17! Evil people do evil things! I suppose you are banning abortion too right? Oh wait nope
5023 2018-03-30 00:17:39 No company likes when a government takes their stocks - & Saudi Crown Prince in US selling himself all over the place - I would not trust him to turn my back while he's standing near me.
5024 2018-03-30 00:17:38 Bump stocks - TBH, this is another "feel good" idea.  No good marksman would use - and someone who does want to, could easily juryrig something else.  A throwaway law tho - so why not?
5025 2018-03-30 00:17:20 Absolutely loved watching you work live! Great job as always!
5026 2018-03-30 00:17:11 Bondage. I remember studying about colonial Williamsburg in elementary school and seeing a picture of the stocks in front of the Old Gaol and thinking “I want to try that out!”
5027 2018-03-30 00:16:54 My superior female brain is planning bills to pay off, researching stocks to buy, and searching to buy my first home all with YOUR money. 

While all your tiny dick driven boy brain is focused on is my peachy ass and sweet laugh. 

Stupid boy.
5028 2018-03-30 00:16:46 @realDonaldTrump@SpeakerRyan    falsely claims, "We got rid of the bump stocks. The bump stocks now are under very strict control." His administration's proposed regulation is still in the mandatory comment period, hasn't been finalized. Then he falsely claims,Nobody reported it
5029 2018-03-30 00:16:25 Their stocks fell today!  Lol
5030 2018-03-30 00:15:09 Saw some huge instantaneous volume spikes today, then trend reversals. Stocks are so fascinating, they are soon going to steal me from my 20 year profession if I'm not careful.
5031 2018-03-30 00:15:02 When people say alt coins are garbage I assume you're a bag holder. Cause those that gained don't need to talk shit. I don't care $ltc went from 240 to 115. Trade it, don't marry it.Just like stocks play the chart, have a game plan. If you don't have a plan you will probably lose
5032 2018-03-30 00:13:37 Haha stick to stocks pal.
5033 2018-03-30 00:13:06 You're just misrepresenting people's argument that mike shouldn't have gone on there because he knew the NRA was lobbying and working against the masses in corrupt fashion.  All these kids are asking for is a ban on assault weapons, BG checks and nixing bump stocks.  You are bein
5034 2018-03-30 00:12:07 I'm sick of hearing about guns. Bump stocks be damned! I'm ok with it, but the guns are not going anywhere. 
I'd watch a cheesy Netflix horror movie, but I've (sort of) boycotted it. because , ya know, Susan Rice is now on the board of directors.
5035 2018-03-30 00:11:55 1. Didn't ask you.
2. United States v. Miller 1939. The government has the legal right to ban certain firearms. Supreme Court ruling. Learn about it.
3. Atheism is okay.
4. Obama isn't the devil. Chill out.
5. No one wants to ban guns. Just assault rifles, bump stocks, etc.

5037 2018-03-30 00:10:23 Not to mention #Drumpf has put the #TransBan back on the books. Hes belittled ppl, caused company stocks to plummet bec of his tweets, fires ppl ON Twitter! Denies he knew abt #StormyDaniels NDA but assigned himself as Defendant aka DD! Hes removed EPA restrictions & STEALS our $
5038 2018-03-30 00:09:51 studies of gun violence, 21 to buy an AR, no more bump stocks - and age 16 to vote. Count on it!
5039 2018-03-30 00:08:55 LOL..I will say it again I will not buy or support any of these companies...now we know where they stand..thank you now watch your stocks go in the tank..that's how we the people respond..not with violence not by rioting like the liberals

5041 2018-03-30 00:08:25 Summary of conversation I had this morning.

"How about no bump stocks."
"Not enough."
"YOU WANT ALL OUR GUNS! AAAAARGH."

5046 2018-03-30 00:06:55 gawd its nice to have INSIDER information so i can short these stocks  :)
5047 2018-03-30 00:06:45 How is less than a 1% increase a HUGE success?  That is a normal day for most stocks.
5048 2018-03-30 00:06:36 some bonds have less weigh in on this
 share the stocks share the same money

5051 2018-03-30 00:00:29 Easter is Sunday and ima look cute for myself.. but it’s gonna be cold, I think.  Should I wear something cute or some Jordan’s? Cause i have some dead stocks waiting to be worn.
5052 2018-03-30 00:00:13 Rothschild went short in 2012 then bought Euro stocks in 2016. Dalio has large short positions now. Smart money says its fucked. From there it's relatively simple.
5053 2018-03-30 00:00:13 Anything can be used as hidden medium of exchange between perps if mutually agreed to—eg bitcoin—ESPECIALLY if actual parties can be kept anonymous—stocks, loans, leases, trusts, consulting fees, even insurance,... mob hits,... antiquities,...
