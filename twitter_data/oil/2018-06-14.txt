46 2018-06-14 23:54:51 More likely not going to have a big rally in oil.  I think 60-70 seems to work for everyone (wti) and will limit supply from the shale cowboys.
47 2018-06-14 23:54:24 They swear by those ! Everyday it’s a discussion what oil to put in the diffuser 
48 2018-06-14 23:53:57 Perhaps cabinet members? Oil and coal companies? Companies wanting EPA standards lowered or dropped? NRA? Good question.
49 2018-06-14 23:53:54 Broadcasted a baseball game. Changed my own oil. Mowed the lawn. Grilled.

This might be the most red-blooded American day I've ever had.

62 2018-06-14 23:52:46 Oil in USD should become much more expensive over time
63 2018-06-14 23:52:39 We are a net exporter of oil
64 2018-06-14 23:52:08 First of all @realDonaldTrump Your buddy Putin is trying to get a decrease on oil production and decrease cause high taxes to the United States. Plus your tariff on steel are causing higher gas prices as well. Stop blaming other people for your problem you created.
65 2018-06-14 23:51:58 S/O to valvoline on mchenry they got all the qts changing my oil.

69 2018-06-14 23:51:32 That's a long time mehn..how about integrating foreign players..there are a lot of African players who would nationalize and play for KSA..see Bahrain is doing it in terms of track and field
70 2018-06-14 23:51:29 There are 65 million "lap dogs" who clearly see the games you're playing for personal fame and money. You arent a journalist, you are a snake oil salesman whos the loudest moron in the room. 65 Million people agree with me and @JesseBWatters.
71 2018-06-14 23:51:29 I actually wasn’t talking about booze. I really meant oil.
72 2018-06-14 23:51:22 Y'all know how I spent $45 for an oil change at jiffy lube :-) my car is currently leaking oil :-) this :-) is :-) why :-) I :-) dont :-) go :-) there :-)
73 2018-06-14 23:51:03 I found 3.5 gram jars of 99.5% CBD at a vape shop for $95 US. Dissolved easily in avocado or MCT oil.
74 2018-06-14 23:50:56 Tbh use baby oil, it works really well!
75 2018-06-14 23:50:44 Veganism is the philosophy that farm animals are more important than basically any other things happening in the world, while buying palm oil and avocados from Columbia funding drug related terrorism and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.
76 2018-06-14 23:50:27 Like you can’t buy oil based stain?
77 2018-06-14 23:50:23 Saudi Arabia started the match against Russia with blistering pace and showed promising signs of causing an upset to the host nation but soon afterwards, They were being dug like an oil well, refined and the rest was history.. #RUSKSA #WorldCup
78 2018-06-14 23:50:16 Well America is Domestic Violence free (I guess)
79 2018-06-14 23:50:15 The oil price increase is crippling Our nations especially the downtrodden majority, when crude oil price increases also price petrol increases & consumers bear the high cost.
80 2018-06-14 23:50:04 The striping away of the regulations that keep our water, air, etc clean, selling off protected lands to mine or take oil from, I could go on but ... I don’t think you can hear me.
81 2018-06-14 23:49:59 No, I don't believe it changes. The curve is based on inventories & price. Pipeline additions add supply that in turn, should result in more oil put into storage and lower price. Since those pipes are operational, the consequence for supply and price are in the yield curve.
82 2018-06-14 23:49:45 Y’all only fw with darkskins when their covered in oil gtf

While I have introduced some markets' phenomena, they may not be helpful to some.  
The reason? 
Seeing is not believing in the world of trading. Without experiencing  those phenomena, it's tough for anyone to build up deep-rooted faith on  them.

104 2018-06-14 23:46:45 Maybe Congressman Zeldin would like to opine as to a fitting penalty for a family of douchebags that run an alleged “charitable” foundation for self-dealing purposes, like settling private lawsuits and buying a $10,000 oil painting of the pater familias.

129 2018-06-14 23:42:45 I dont like that method tbh. I prefer heat up oil (just enough to coat the pan) cook mushrooms in single layer to and char up both sides a bit, add garlic and sautee til brown and fragrant, deglaze with wine and reduce. idk why teriyaki is in there at all??
130 2018-06-14 23:42:44 I can't manage to remember when I got an oil change last but I can walk down a cereal aisle and remember a girl I spent one night with in college loved apple cinnamon cheerios, being human sucks

145 2018-06-14 23:40:03 My take is that once Saudi recognised in 2014 they'd been shafted by Obama they shifted oil proceeds to PetroEuro, but Saudi has now switched back to $ via prepay. € QE provided € liquidity for (say) Bund purchases. Possibility Saudi also insisted on gold backing

150 2018-06-14 23:39:02 I say give the whole lot. Everything. Fishing, oil, mining. No wealth sharing. Wales, Scotland, NI, regions, eat what you kill.
151 2018-06-14 23:38:52 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

157 2018-06-14 23:38:16 Can you imagine what would happen to the price of steel and oil if we went to war with China 
158 2018-06-14 23:38:16 I just .... I canNOT get down with the essential oils trend. Anxious? There’s an oil for that. Tired? There’s an oil for that? Driving to work, speeding, get pulled over, get a $300 speeding ticket, get a flat tire, late to work, get fired? There’s an oil for that!
159 2018-06-14 23:38:13 You forgot oil, natural gas, beef, pork, energy and probably some more I can't think of right now. Really the only industry that voted HRC was ports (and only a handful of them) and a few major cities in higher populated states.

173 2018-06-14 23:35:16 If oil demand falls by 80% yes and there’s a Great Depression 2, yes this is the mother of all prewar periods. Concentrated power is usually redistributed violently and unwillingly
174 2018-06-14 23:35:01 America could achieve energy independence by harvesting the oil off all your touch screens. Or McDonald’s could use the grease for French fries.

180 2018-06-14 23:33:34 CBC is just reporting what he said, and he also said the he wants bi-lateral deals with Canada and Mexico, therefore,  divide and concur. We should trade more the EU and forget the US,  they just take. We sell our oil at a 30% discount to them, we need the pipeline. #cdnpoli
181 2018-06-14 23:33:27 that’s what i use and it works very nicely but i like the oil more than the lotion

188 2018-06-14 23:32:14 What are people in the West taught in school nowadays?  FYI Russia is the second largest exporter of oil in the world.
189 2018-06-14 23:32:13 And who pays for cost of waste Aaron? Milk down the toilet. SM costs consumers. Why not SM beef, apples, how about oil? SM is a Soviet inspired system.

236 2018-06-14 23:25:44 # nothamradio It's traded as a commodity same as wheat, pork, oil etc. One of the biggest scams. Recycle save the planet, pluck the heart strings. When its recycle and line our pockets. Oh and lets make it a  state law you have to recycle while were at it.
237 2018-06-14 23:25:42 Boil spaghetti without salt, add salt to the water only after it's done, mix for few secs and drain. This also prevents sticking if u don't like the oil alternative.

246 2018-06-14 23:24:26 Honestly Saudi Arabia is a football loving nation but sadly they lack the players to excel at an international level, they should copy from the playbook of Arabian countries like Bahrain who offer citizenship and other incentives to Athletes particularly from Africa to join them.
247 2018-06-14 23:23:59 Stephhh thought I’d suggest rosehip oil since I know the tretinion gel will help stop any new breakouts but not treat old scars, after I was done with my treatment I was still left with the old scars but rosehip oil literally faded them by like 75% after two weeks.
248 2018-06-14 23:23:53 There's alot of questions but I'll try to answer efficiently lol yes there is tar in the Santa Barbara beaches cause of the oil tankers in the ocean. Yes, I live like 5 minutes away from the beach. Yes, really lol. Since as long as I've been in UCSB.

258 2018-06-14 23:22:42 NO we are not.  We still import oil from Canada, and there are materials used in manufacturing that can ONLY be found in China.  The lithium for our batteries is imported from other countries. The iPhone that your probably using is imported.

263 2018-06-14 23:22:21 Regarding stability, do you consider Benghazi more or less stable now than in 2012-13? Has the oil crescent been more or less stable since 2016? Has Libya benefited from the income generated by oil sales since the LNA took the oil crescent - w/o burning terminals?
264 2018-06-14 23:22:06 In part the low NY GHG for electricity is because in Northern NY by far most of the electricity is clean nuckear and hydro power, so gas/oil heating WILL be a larger GHG contributor in NY, even if electric heat is used, since it doesn't emit much GHG.

283 2018-06-14 23:18:13 I eventually gave up on mine after like a year. It never stopped hurting.  I would recommend trying saline solution though, not an essential oil.

287 2018-06-14 23:17:39 Slathering myself in coconut oil and coming outside was basically an invite for these mosquitoes to feast on me #issamistake
288 2018-06-14 23:17:24 It's a heavy/thick oil and for me that was a con 

Everything else about it was great
289 2018-06-14 23:17:17 The only sustainable solar panels are tree leaves and plants, which also happen to capture and sequester CO2.

You wanna save the planet? Stop subsidizing chemical-laden, low-energy-density solar PV panels, and start planting trees, and pushing for Industrial Hemp. Replace oil.

Smart tvs, sure
292 2018-06-14 23:16:21 Exactly. It's total bullshit!
293 2018-06-14 23:15:54 They also sit on a huge oil deposit that they refuse to develop
294 2018-06-14 23:15:44 Fun fact in the oil bust of the 80’s this yard held 6% of the worlds drill pipe.
295 2018-06-14 23:15:39 I have seen digital pieces that look like oil paintings, and oil paintings that are so smooth I'm like 'How on earth did you hide all of your brushstrokes 10/10' (See: Todd Lockwood and Kelsey J Beckett respectively)

300 2018-06-14 23:14:55 Someone in my town was sucked in by 1 of these scams. Told her he was on oil rig, she never met him in person, was doing his banking 4 him, Homeland Sec. warned her. Then she used stolen CCs he sent her to buy iPhones/iPads to ship to him. She was finally arrested. Ruined life.

311 2018-06-14 23:13:42 Mr Scott Harris says you must constantly check and recheck you vision for space to ensure it is still relevant, like checking the oil in your car #ASPISpace
312 2018-06-14 23:13:39 This may not be something you'd be able to obtain legally, but I have prescription THC/CBD oil to treat AS. It allowed me to stop taking pain meds altogether, and might be an option worth looking into.

You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me
all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD
forever.
317 2018-06-14 23:12:56 I Googled & saw what's cars shop is all abt think as per wiki a money laundering scam in state owned petroleum industry if I am not wrong. My feeling that politically every country when is comes to petroleum or oil they are vulnerable to even show their transparency in dealings.
318 2018-06-14 23:12:42 We just released one of the most intoxicating, wondrous records I’ve ever had the pleasure of being involved with - the debut album from @SOPHIEMSMSMSM - Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides. It all starts here.

321 2018-06-14 23:12:04 I was just wondering if anyone makes TeaTree oil bar soap ?
322 2018-06-14 23:11:59 They know that’s five World Cup goals worth of oil they’ve just sold.
323 2018-06-14 23:11:10 S/O to my bestf @Zyanna00 vitamin E oil LITERALLY DA TRUFFF 
324 2018-06-14 23:11:09 I don't understand Portillo's position here. He knows how trade deals work from his oil days. There is boardroom vote to explore a new venture, and then another vote on the final deal. Suddenly the second vote isn't needed, even though Brexit is a trade deal? #bbctw #bbcqt

331 2018-06-14 23:10:14 Coconut oil is fucking awesome too
332 2018-06-14 23:10:07 Big time.  Canada and Quebec would be thriving now with the exports in oil. It should be against the law to import from foreign countries when your own country can supply ALL their needs.

339 2018-06-14 23:08:42 I officially prefer olive oil over tanning oil
340 2018-06-14 23:08:39 Really?! I’d much rather see this than a pile of poop on the pavement! At the end of the day there are worse things on pavements than paint! Litter, oil, fuel, gum, poop (not always from an animal either!), drunk peoples sick... yep, sorry but nothing wrong with a bit of paint!
341 2018-06-14 23:08:29 That's right. He prefers that the oil continues to come from Saudi Arabia.

350 2018-06-14 23:07:19  The UK also increased retirement age to 67, but life expectancy is higher. An oil rich country like Russia should have better living standards and health care for its citizens.
351 2018-06-14 23:07:14 How many jobs are going to be created with all the tax revenue from Falllands oil discoveries? We’re an incredibly rich nation about to become richer. They don’t talk about that though. LOL. Laughing all the way to the bank.
352 2018-06-14 23:07:00 Bizarrely when Nigel Farage got cancer, he did go and get treated by an expert, not by a snake oil vendor.
353 2018-06-14 23:06:59 Scott Pruitt says all exemptions to the oil refineries have been in line with the DOE. He says it hasn't been an isolated decision.

365 2018-06-14 23:04:55 Dems, GOP, both corporate bought parties run by Big Oil,  Big Pharma, Ag... wall st.. etc.  We must be the generation to end the military/ prison industrial complex.  End corporat-ocracy, end endless war.  Or nothing will really change.
366 2018-06-14 23:04:55 I also figured out today that coffee filters make excellent oil blotter sheets 
367 2018-06-14 23:04:48 Yeah I have some oil. Will consider. Thank you
368 2018-06-14 23:04:33 Just tried out my new homemade anti-acne (I hope) face scrub made from coconut oil, been oil and haritaki powder. Because that's what I have lying available to use. Skin feels nice.

372 2018-06-14 23:04:17 Man try slaving over a stove for hours every night. Y’all change oil one every 3 months and it only take about 20-30 minutes if that lol
373 2018-06-14 23:03:56 we managed to break 3 different kitchen items today. here’s how they rank:

china saucer - biggest boom
aperitif glass - biggest bummer
bottle of olive oil - meanest mess

they come in 3s... right?
374 2018-06-14 23:03:51 Agree that trump tariff on oil profoundly unlikely. But I can't come up with another explanation for the spreads blowing out. Anything else that would screw up Cushing inventory should also cause a big front month price spike which we're not seeing.
375 2018-06-14 23:03:20 do u have any sort of liquid thts not water?? u might be able to toast the sesame seeds in some vegetable oil before u put em on the rice.... id do masala and/or ginger too
376 2018-06-14 23:03:14 Sure! A basic DIY scrub is 1/2 c of sugar or salt (the more coarse, the more exfoliating) to 1/2 c of coconut oil, olive oil, sweet almond, etc. I usually add a drop or two of essential oils or vanilla extract.
377 2018-06-14 23:03:00 Good choice. Does he use Cod-Liver Oil though?
378 2018-06-14 23:02:35 Mann to change the oil you gotta drain the car.. y’all ain’t doin nothin that hard
379 2018-06-14 23:02:27 OIL OF EVERY PEARLS UN INSIDES FINALLY OUT
380 2018-06-14 23:02:19 Finally about to get this oil changed
381 2018-06-14 23:02:19 Me: *puts a splash of Lavender oil*
Eryka: “You smell like tree... No! You smell like white lady!” 
382 2018-06-14 23:02:06 They was tryna charge me 60 for my oil change how fast I come up with a lie
383 2018-06-14 23:02:05 The problem is there isn't players from the bottom of the roster to shave off. At least not in any amount that would meaningfully allow the Oilers to spend big at the top. 

Oil can save money by finding ways to cut ties with overpaid players (2, 4, 27).
384 2018-06-14 23:01:30 We bombed many countries with much less oil than #Canada. No reasonable #American should expect Canada getting away with so much oil without being punished! @JustinTrudeau who inherited Canadian throne from his dad - coincidently also #Trudeau, is a typical Middle North dictator!
385 2018-06-14 23:01:28 今日は金曜日。
386 2018-06-14 23:01:25 Trump’s getting a piece of the action that Pruit pulls in from chemical, oil, etc. 

It’s the only reason Pruits still in the game.
387 2018-06-14 23:01:12 頭痛いが病院行ってくるのじゃ…
388 2018-06-14 23:01:12 Trudeau and the liberals want a poorer #Canada to get Canadians to depend more on the government. Trump’s Higher tariffs are helping liberals achieve their goals. Take #Alberta as an example! Stifling free enterprise, nationalizing pipeline, restricting international oil trade.
389 2018-06-14 23:00:52 Drown it in deep conditioner and oil to detangle it really helps. My hair hasn’t grown in months cause I’m ruthless with it too
390 2018-06-14 23:00:48 I use which ever miceller water is on sale, but I only use it in the morning bc it doesn't remove SPF, so I use a gentle cleanser at night (and almond oil to remove eye makeup)
391 2018-06-14 23:00:04 Everyone knows oil prices are about to fall.

402 2018-06-14 22:58:25 tips for acne:
—use a moisturizer that has acne medication in it or is OIL FREE
—apply acne cream every other night on pimples 
—DON’T USE TOOTHPASTE on acne it just causes extra irritation & redness 
—do not pop or pick at pimples it will just spread them more

426 2018-06-14 22:53:24 The nature of oil is very dynamic. You can sleep tonight @RealDonad_Trump because the price might be reviewed downwards by the interplay of many factors just like this utterance. They are quite a function of  #PredictiveAnalytics
427 2018-06-14 22:53:13 Whew. I am gonna blame the coconut oil on the screen lol x thx much xxx
428 2018-06-14 22:53:06 Just how does he figure the money will be used to move away from oil? Alberta gets squat in royalties and the people working in oil think global warming is a hoax.
429 2018-06-14 22:52:57 Bro... you car engine gonna seize up and ur gonna blow the gasket... 

New engine = $3,000

432 2018-06-14 22:52:01 So, plausible but not anywhere near realization? Every time something like this comes up, I wish for a glimpse inside the patent archives of the big oil companies (because they bought everything they could that might be competition for so many years).

434 2018-06-14 22:51:22 This was a testimonial of Saudi Arabs as ...can't play or do anything...they look stupid and Crown Prince looked more stupid...beside oil $$$ Crown Prince may just found a security job in walmart...Saudi born Islam destroyed persian civilization 1400 years ago ??? #SaudiArabia
435 2018-06-14 22:51:19 lmfao yup, he was like fuck they got the oil chill
436 2018-06-14 22:51:08 @6PRbreakfast @BasilZempilas tell Millsy that chips cooked in an air fryer are better for you & taste good! Chips used to be cooked in was Lard, Now shops use vegetable oil. My parents owned Palmyra Fish & Chips back in 90’s & they used real potato, not frozen!! They were yummy!
437 2018-06-14 22:50:53 Forgot i need an oil change 
438 2018-06-14 22:50:40 Which show?
439 2018-06-14 22:50:31 Scraped the oil pan. I got stuck at La Costa . My tires weren't gripping cause the car wasn't even sitting on the tires. It was like a teeter totter
440 2018-06-14 22:50:22 My edges are finally to the point that I can put water and oil on them with a scarf and they staydown for majority of the day.  only took 20 Years 
441 2018-06-14 22:50:02 You got it for real!!!!  Truffles....Nom Nom Mmmmmm Yummola.  Truffle Oil BLECH!!! Neither Tasty Truffle or Tasty Oil
442 2018-06-14 22:50:00 Wait wait wait.... he wants a trade? Is he trying to flip to whose court the balls in? Do the oil want him gone or he wants out??
443 2018-06-14 22:49:54 "Burn the midday oil" said no one ever.
444 2018-06-14 22:49:36 Interesting question. I think you might very well be right. We should cover oil more in general soon.
445 2018-06-14 22:49:34 Night plan
446 2018-06-14 22:49:29 My ears are so sensitive the only thing that helps them and mto gauges are CBD oil
447 2018-06-14 22:49:19 Time to work on some oil alternatives and produce non-oil based products.
448 2018-06-14 22:49:15 Are you saying that what you are paying now is the same as last summer, and the one before, and before that? I'm seeing higher prices than I have in years all over. Wait until Canada charges extra for US exports of their oil. #TrumpGasPrice
449 2018-06-14 22:49:14 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
450 2018-06-14 22:49:03 I’ve seen results from castor oil on brows and lashes. I was doing it but wasn’t consistent so I didn’t get same results. Your tweet made me want to start it back up
451 2018-06-14 22:48:59 There is absolutely ZERO doubt in my mind that the gas attacks we blamed Syria for were false flags by the previous US regime in order to try to get us directly involved in Syria.  It all goes back to that oil pipeline, and our govt is in Saudi Arabia’s back pocket
452 2018-06-14 22:48:52 バナナ！？バナナナンデ！？
453 2018-06-14 22:48:50 Saudi Arabia! 
Cos if they loose they gon hike oil
454 2018-06-14 22:48:45 my tip to you: if you want energy throughout the day, skip breakfast and drink a big ol' coffee with a tablespoon of coconut oil dissolved in it.
455 2018-06-14 22:48:45 When you were a little kid, were you ever given castor oil.
456 2018-06-14 22:48:40 Fuck a pipeline. I want an Oil refinery in Northern Alberta. See how much that "Hurts" them. It would create jobs and Canadians could buy their gas from Canada.
457 2018-06-14 22:48:35 I know it perpetuates the leftorium, but maybe Calvert is a fit.  Pretty lean pickings in the bargain bin this year. Pirri seems to have his named bandied about quite often on Oilers now.

459 2018-06-14 22:48:20 My super power is being able to tan without using tanning oil
460 2018-06-14 22:48:17 its not stupid at all, only to those whose pockets are lined with money from oil companies
461 2018-06-14 22:48:14 Plus,remember last year,we found out (via an excellent Investigative reporter) that Trump had taken some Donation monies out of ANOTHER Fund that he had, and stole $10,000.00 to buy a oil painting of HIMSELF and then put that ugly painting in the foyer of one of his Trump Hotels
462 2018-06-14 22:48:08 all my money is ab to go to my car . i need new windshield wipers , oil change , tires rotated , new windshield , & my hood fixed
463 2018-06-14 22:48:08 @jiffylube how is it your sign spinner is holding a sign "Oil change $24.99"  I pull in..get the cheap @Pennzoil oil change and it costs me $48?
464 2018-06-14 22:47:40 If it's discovered that Yemen has massive oil reserves underground you can bet the US will be there ASAP
465 2018-06-14 22:47:29 Virgin pa din ba ang Virgin Coconut Oil kung maraming beses na itong ginamit?
466 2018-06-14 22:47:11 Don't forget that the control was the low-fat diet. It's not implausible that a bit higher fat and more nuts and olive oil had benefits compared to that, I expect that will always be true, but this does mean the various p-hacking studies from PREDIMED can be laid aside.
467 2018-06-14 22:47:01 Attempting to cure the common cold before #seachange18 with Advil cold and sinus, Buckley’s, vicks, peppermint essential oil, and 11 hours of sleep. Wish me luck.

469 2018-06-14 22:46:36 I'm glad she cleared that up. Now I am going online to try to understand what the heck coal mayo and coal oil are...I mean the latter sounds like a future enery crisis issue...
470 2018-06-14 22:46:04 Oil me up a fry me daddy
471 2018-06-14 22:45:45 My favorite is oil soaked pans that get washed by hand so the bottom doesn’t get touched so every time you try to cook something the kitchen is hot boxed by old olives.
472 2018-06-14 22:45:24 we have your oil, lumber, medicine, textiles, minerals and more.  Fuck this crap with Canada not matter.  we matter, but we'll take our ball and go home.
473 2018-06-14 22:45:20 And he still has his job
474 2018-06-14 22:45:05 The tea tree oil stuff is fuckin' miraculous. Household with 6 kids growing up. Thoughts and prayers.
475 2018-06-14 22:45:00 She kept scratching the left arm. She said “mommy I need oils”. I put some Eczema Relief Oil on it. Now watching to see if she scratches again. So far, so good. It’s been 5 mins. I haven’t seen her scratch yet.
476 2018-06-14 22:44:52 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
477 2018-06-14 22:44:51 Oil goes rancid, would have been fairly obvious
478 2018-06-14 22:44:44 Gotta listen to oil of every pearl's uninsides properly but all I know is that immaterial took my life first listen.
479 2018-06-14 22:44:38 Quentin just confused the name of Saucy Brew Works and referred to it as "Blood Oil"
480 2018-06-14 22:44:10 Pake baby oil/olive oil deh
481 2018-06-14 22:44:08 You gotta get the kind you add egg, milk and oil too
482 2018-06-14 22:44:06 I spay oil sheen on it and that’s about it. I use the castor oil while doing the twist out.
483 2018-06-14 22:43:44 Pake baby oil ada ga?
484 2018-06-14 22:43:32 But what about the oil?  (Sarcasm)
485 2018-06-14 22:43:27 Yes, agree that would be a factor as well. But, I would hazard a guess &  bet Trump would not slap sanctions on Canadian oil, my sense is that is a step too far even for him.
486 2018-06-14 22:43:26 Is it humanly possible to work in the oil field and not advertise it on your vehicle? 
487 2018-06-14 22:43:22 if US is so self sufficient why are gas prices so high...surely its got enough oil not to rely on OPEC
488 2018-06-14 22:43:13 They do stop the pain but they stop life too. But I was trying to treat my Lyme disease with the cannabis oil. I could handle the injuries pain but the Lyme disease pain is horrific crap shoot everyday. I saw the best Drs but my prognosis was poor. The govt knows. They won’t help
489 2018-06-14 22:42:52 Time they came home and became the start of a 2nd chamber in Scotland. With oil revenue and excise duty we can afford a 2nd chamber.
490 2018-06-14 22:42:39 I used my other analogy of the hot girl next door laying out in her bikini , she knows you watch , so she calls you over to oil her  , only to have her BF show up .... opps blocked again  .....earlier

494 2018-06-14 22:41:47 SURVEY:  What kind of allergies Monsta X will give me this time?

(Got olive oil, turkey, some kind of medicines and cosmetics allergy last time)
495 2018-06-14 22:41:41 Seems reasonable to me and in the range I expected (1.25-1.5 mill). But some area of twitter there are a lot of Oil fans and fans who dislike Chia that seem to think this is a gross overpay.
496 2018-06-14 22:41:31 Saudi Arabia, you went looking for oil in Russia? Now you saw five alive. Issorite. I wonder how they manage to qualify sef
497 2018-06-14 22:41:31 Definitely! I mean, I'm a Swede n been living in Scotland since 2002. just look at Scandinavia.  Only Norway has oil. Den, Swe and Fin hasn't. Yet, every single country has higher standard of life than the UK..  Independence any day please! 
498 2018-06-14 22:41:30 Jamaican Black castor oil don’t work? That’s a first. I use that and blue magic grease.

500 2018-06-14 22:41:07 and yet you don't hear a lot of Out-Loud-Wondering on why a multi-billionaire is running so many shitty scams and snake oil operations for what should amount to pocket change

504 2018-06-14 22:40:57 RT: @RaoulGMI: Also with OPEC weakening and Trump applying pressure, the odds of a very sharp move lower in oil is extremely high.

516 2018-06-14 22:39:43 I was always baffled that some believe that Russia and Saudi Arabia consider $70 "too high" of oil price to begin with... It is still too low! The bullishness begins after they raise output and we still see draws.
517 2018-06-14 22:39:42 Since Trudeau elected, Oil up 46%. 
Canadian $ down 1%.  How is this even possible.?
518 2018-06-14 22:39:40 Maybe that's why England is so desperate to hang on to Scotland? I'm sure that it has nothing too do with the oil, fish, farming and other natural resources.
519 2018-06-14 22:38:58 All wrong. It’s coconut oil
520 2018-06-14 22:38:52 Let me know when you find out. I honestly just pick it out lightly and oil it everyday.

524 2018-06-14 22:38:00 i think people overhyped coconut oil as moisturizing, it clogs my pores for a body oil i feel i feel like rose oil is a bit thinner and it releases a light scent of roses through out the day.
525 2018-06-14 22:37:40 Interesting way of saying the oil companies are still in control

566 2018-06-14 22:32:15 Thanks Bruce, much appreciated. It occurred to me later - could it be someone thinks Trump Admin is about to sanction Canadian oil? That would explain it too.

583 2018-06-14 22:30:21 The front spread usually moves DOWN sharply going into OPEX, but this is opposite direction. Profound move up in NQ, QU and UV, and now VX and XZ catching a bid as well. Could it be someone thinks Trump is about to sanction Canadian oil imports?

587 2018-06-14 22:29:58 So the Trump “Foundation” was simply a slush fund used for whatever he wanted—oil paintings, legal bills, campaign expenses, etc. Everything except charity. Is ANYONE surprised?
588 2018-06-14 22:29:50 He is at least honest. He believes ppl will die and that is okay because big oil's near term future matters more to him.

A line has been crossed here. JT's response to this will be very revealing...
589 2018-06-14 22:29:50 Not at all surprising. After all, in a notorious Trump classic, His Royal Illegitimacy demonstrated his "charitable nature" by finagling money from his own charity to pay for an expensive full length oil portrait of himself!
YEAH WHAT A SELF LOVING ANIMAL HE IS.
590 2018-06-14 22:29:36 He explained that with a council in place, Nigeria would be positioned to cultivate one million hectares of oil palm in the next five years.

636 2018-06-14 22:25:07 CA gas tax is not driving oil prices contributing to higher costs. It’s Trumps policies on Iran and environmental protection.

That stuff has pretty low CBD.
728 2018-06-14 22:13:46 Shaving oil is 1000x better than shaving cream. Literally just because I can see what's going on all the time.
729 2018-06-14 22:13:45 #BestSummerAdvice stay indoors during excessive heat warnings, wear sunscreen & drink plenty of water. Walk your dog either in the morning or after dark so the heat absorbed on the sidewalk doesn't burn their paws. Use tea tree oil & lavender instead of bug spray, it works!

731 2018-06-14 22:13:39 Castor oil is good cus you can put it directly where you need it, it's controlled. I don't brush it too to much either cus it breaks my hair so easily. That's what I've done. You can also get hair treatments, MAKE hair masks etc lol

U.S.A. needs to repeal the law allowing the exporting of oil, is creating the OPEC situation.
It was passed to protect the U.S.A. ability for energy independence.

752 2018-06-14 22:10:27 My point is that oil is pretty much always the most flexible and most convenient fuel, so it's nearly always a potential substitute for other fuels.

767 2018-06-14 22:07:54 Oil only makes up 5% of electricity production in remote locales because of high energy density and places where it's abundant. It's last of the big five in electricity. Nukes would be competing with coal and gas primarily.

While high oil prices will boost our Forex reserve, low oil prices should reduce the landing cost of refined oil products

857 2018-06-14 21:58:42 national security threat is that what we are ,  Maybe we should cut off the water and elitric power and the  oil
858 2018-06-14 21:58:40 Yeah, the equation fits perfect. Oil + Vodka > Oil 
859 2018-06-14 21:58:31 "We want to make our corporate farms the best in class so that we can bring everyone’s essential oil quality up around the world." – Lauren Walker, Chief Supply Officer #YLConvention #yleo
860 2018-06-14 21:58:21 Yup. Same flaw in logic when people talk about the oil and gas industry: "think of all those oil workers who will be unemployed" (instead of realizing new jobs will just appear in other sectors).
861 2018-06-14 21:58:19 I need to get more oil blotting papers. My face has been sooooo oily
862 2018-06-14 21:58:12 Rachel Ray doesn't have to curse to sell olive oil? Well I do, so fuck her and fuck you too!
863 2018-06-14 21:58:12 Getting this oil change, then getting in my bed!
864 2018-06-14 21:58:09 This coconut/olive oil spray gives me life
865 2018-06-14 21:58:08 "Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides" is better than I could have hoped for and now I'm more stoked than ever to see SOPHIE at @LadyLandFest next week.
866 2018-06-14 21:58:05 If it bothers you (i can’t stand the slightest oiliness on my hair so I’d understand) you can try dry shampoo between regular shampoos, or getting your hair up in French/Dutch braids. Covers up 2nd/3rd day oil pretty well ! 
867 2018-06-14 21:58:03 That’s my Indigenous side. Jewish Italian - smoked salmon w/ oranges, fennel, red sweet onions, over baby arugula, wth fresh squeezed lemon & olive oil. A not too dry white from Tuscany.

870 2018-06-14 21:57:50 It’s only wrong when the Trump admin does it. Obama did the same thing for 8 years and not a peep from these crybabies.
871 2018-06-14 21:57:50 Me: I have a headache 
Sweet coworker: do you want Advil? I have some you can take! 
Me: I prefer to rub peppermint oil all over my face and then, when it doesn’t work, pop 3 Advil at home when no ones watching, but thanks so much!!!

874 2018-06-14 21:57:29 So, browned a bunch of boneless pork chops in a braising pan, and set those aside while sauteing onions & garlic in a bit of oil w salt and pepper, Deglazed with cider vinegar & worchestershire sauce, stirred in a blop of dijon & some brown sugar...
875 2018-06-14 21:57:00 The fact that I had to google “castor oil near me” to find a black beauty supply store
876 2018-06-14 21:56:59 @WhiteHouse 3 children Died on a oil field tank That I said to the court, and the boy I told not to get on that tank killed his three Friends.

882 2018-06-14 21:56:23 Reheating fries:

Sprinkle with salt and olive oil, make sure the skillet is hot. Toss for a couple of minutes and serve.

883 2018-06-14 21:56:16 Just need .35% for my 2018 Inversion call to happen but still believe I need oil to break under $59 for that to happen
884 2018-06-14 21:56:04 I’ll never forget the customer years ago that needed a new engine. 27K and never changed the oil. She said because it was a new car she didn’t think it needed oil changes.
885 2018-06-14 21:55:50 bitch what glow i look like i stuffed my face with marshmallows and smeared baby oil all over it  :((((
886 2018-06-14 21:55:36 Well Russia itself is second largest exporter of oilafter Saudi Arabia. Vodka + oil is obviously better than just oil.
887 2018-06-14 21:55:14 Get up get out you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to you knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
888 2018-06-14 21:54:56 My mom just did the oil change in my car and took it to get the breaks fixed without me asking her to do it. She’s the best. I’m blessed 
889 2018-06-14 21:54:55 Lies!!! US is after oil in Libya, they are not interested in truth! This is spineless journalism

891 2018-06-14 21:54:50 "We have much oil" - Saudi Arabia
892 2018-06-14 21:54:46 Holy crap. The original Oil Can Boyd.
893 2018-06-14 21:54:39 Saudi Arabia ate only good at oil search field trips.
894 2018-06-14 21:54:34 It was my salad dressing, olive oil and balsamic vinegar, so it was in the fridge with my salad
895 2018-06-14 21:54:27 Saudi Arabia should just concentrate in selling crude oil. Football isn't for everyone.
896 2018-06-14 21:54:25 So apparently they have no problem paying for a new engine as they run their car with no oil?!????
897 2018-06-14 21:54:22 Wild Growth Light Oil Treatment. I use it every time I shower, just a couple drops in shampoo/conditioner. Super easy and super effective 
898 2018-06-14 21:54:21 Brent crude today trades at $76 pb ..... it's historical average is just over $40 and this price brought prosperity to the UK. The $100+ price was a spike, oil is a traded commodity, prices go up, prices go down, at the moment the trend is up. Please get your facts correct.
899 2018-06-14 21:54:19 Try Some SAMe, GABA, or EFA's Fish Oil! It Works Better Than Drugs Alcohol. Also Reading The Psalms of David!
900 2018-06-14 21:54:11 Nothing like a hot scoop of oil sludge to make an engine chuck a rod through the hood on the freeway at 75mph on a 115 degree day.

905 2018-06-14 21:53:37 Start with the fact that they TAR sands, not oil sands.
906 2018-06-14 21:53:33 Virgin olive oil comes from???
907 2018-06-14 21:53:33 I believe in u  but yeah in school I'd always use acrylic or oil since they're so much easier lol 
908 2018-06-14 21:53:15 They slipped on their own oil & it looked like they’ve had vodka shots when @Cheryshev slotted his 1st & @TeamRussia’s 2nd in the #WorldCup. But the 4th goal was special.

911 2018-06-14 21:53:05 Haven’t seen much of that, but we’re noticing a trend of people being waaaaaaaay overdue on oil changes. Like, setting check engine lights due to being so overdue. Crazy
912 2018-06-14 21:52:50 If you were a real president of the greatest country then why couldn’t you keep oil prices less than $20 a barrel?
913 2018-06-14 21:52:47 It's not about the oil but the talent and the practice

919 2018-06-14 21:52:00 "SOPHIE - Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides" releases tomorrow. If there's one album you listen to this year, make it this one.
920 2018-06-14 21:51:54 It's got an incredible selection of already made colors with rich pigmentation, you can use it like a regular acrylic, mix it with water and treat it like a water color, or you can use its additional mediums and work it like an oil.  It's very versatile.
921 2018-06-14 21:51:29 Isabel Shot Her Lot on #bbcqt 
Baby oil and wet wipes to hand as she talks a lot of wank.
922 2018-06-14 21:51:28 i have a small crush on the woman who is waiting for her oil change at this car dealership and i am letting her know how cute she is by avoiding eye contact as studiously as possible
923 2018-06-14 21:51:27 See I'm super oily but cleansing gives me big dry spots just around my mouth so I just put moisturizer there

Do you rinse away oil cleansers??? How are you not oily after?
924 2018-06-14 21:51:15 9/11 was all about oil, how are you all blind to see that
925 2018-06-14 21:51:13 Something I heard at the closing keynote today. "Data is the new oil." The way technology is advancing it make perfect sense. Whoever can control the flow of data will be millionaire's.
926 2018-06-14 21:51:08 I bought an herbal oil diffuser and my mom called me gay how y'all doing
927 2018-06-14 21:51:07 In a bid for better sleep I bought lavender oil but it leaked during my flight and now everything, and when I say everything I mean everything, stinks of lavender and I want to rip my nose off
928 2018-06-14 21:51:02 The @ImpossibleFoods burger is getting a lot of love these days, but is it healthy? First five ingredients are: Water, Textured Wheat Protein, Coconut Oil, Potato Protein, Natural Flavors. That looks like one big potato chip to me.
929 2018-06-14 21:51:00 Girl, it needs an oil change, windshield wiper washed, and cleaned fully on the inside.
930 2018-06-14 21:50:59 What is a rumor?   thank you, thank you... Alex, I'll take oil price manipulation for $500
931 2018-06-14 21:50:56 They thought that was drilling oil
932 2018-06-14 21:50:54 The smell of warm vanilla hits his nostrils again. Yeah, gunna associate this with my pretty boy. He groans softly as your fingers begin to work the oil into his skin.
933 2018-06-14 21:50:52 Nope but I got brand new tires and a fresh oil change to get me there.
934 2018-06-14 21:50:51 The thumbs up and dumb ass grins are to symbolize that they are winning the takedown of America, taking our health coverage, raising interest rates, gas, groceries, building material, clothing, water, electricity, heating oil & gas.  This is to signify the rich will get richer.
935 2018-06-14 21:50:50 #keepitintheground we need a massive public uprising to pressure politicians into banning these dangerous, life threatening practices. How many train explosions, oil spills, #fracking earthquakes, or poisoned rivers will it take until politicians wake up?
936 2018-06-14 21:50:32 Yeah. So y'all can use some of them oil money to "buy" some decent players. Lol
937 2018-06-14 21:50:26 Ain’t nothing wrong with eating some bread dipped in olive oil, balsamic vinegar and various herbs
938 2018-06-14 21:50:17 A classic artist for oil paintings and installations. That was actually the plan originally but I hated the art community with a passion ;) I like practical art.

941 2018-06-14 21:49:45 I cleaned my deep fat fryer in January. Refilled it with oil, forgetting to put the pan back in. I cleaned the plate and wires: it kept smoking. Kept cleaning; it kept smoking... Finally, last week, it stopped smoking and I had my first chips in five months. Life is good.
942 2018-06-14 21:49:42 No one! They threatened To cut oil to rest of the world and boom, they got to play in the World Cup!
943 2018-06-14 21:49:34 Went on the advice of @Scubadidas and picked up some @SpartansDen classic beard oil and some Balmy Beards beard balm. That shit smells glorious.

948 2018-06-14 21:48:59 The price of electricity needs to be lower in relation to gas and oil first. Electric heating is hugely  more expensive and pv panels still costly to fit.

955 2018-06-14 21:47:53 You know you’re a POstable when your mom asks if you want a tuna/avocado sandwich and you have to make sure the tuna didn’t come from the same place she buys motor oil. #POstables  
956 2018-06-14 21:47:46 Way to go! I’m  because my current mentee mechanic brother advised me to check the oil in my car since oil light was occasionally on. He was pretty impressed I knew where and how to do it. His sis and I might go part time nursing and pick up some MOT servicing for the craic.
957 2018-06-14 21:47:45 I’ve gotten splashed twice by hot oil. I’m not cooking ANYMORE
958 2018-06-14 21:47:44 Jets burn massive amount of fuel. Only about 8% of refined crude is jet fuel. So how much oil is going to need to be refined to satisfy jet traffic? Massive.
959 2018-06-14 21:47:43 She can go to work for the cigarette companies, she can go to work for the oil companies, she can go back to working for the GOP lots of stuff she can do Liars are in demand

961 2018-06-14 21:47:24 Canada upset by US tariffs.  People boycotting US tomatoes and oranges. Wow  Meanwhile, we are also against developing non-US crude markets, handing over $15 Billion annually.  What if we could retaliate by shutting off our oil shipments to the US and send it elsewhere?  #cdnoil
962 2018-06-14 21:47:17 If we cut all government subsidies to all the industries in Canada where would we be, would development in the oil sands have been where it is today, forestry, steel and aluminum, auto industry, etc etc etc.
963 2018-06-14 21:47:17 “I’m such an adult,” I whisper to myself as I eat the free goldfish snacks at the car dealership after taking myself to get my oil changed without my father.
964 2018-06-14 21:47:14 Corruption doesn't mean evil. Trump made it clear who he was when he was running his campaign: a snake oil salesman who is being run by Putin. Putin obviously has something big on him, no other way to explain his fondness of Putin and his contempt for our closest allies.
965 2018-06-14 21:47:07 The oil is 100% factor 50 I swear it’s one of a kind
966 2018-06-14 21:47:02 I’ll have 10 billion oil and 3 points for 10000 of your women
967 2018-06-14 21:47:02 I was jamming to Queen of my Doublewide on my way to get my oil change and I forgot to turn off my Bluetooth. The service guy looked at me and gave me a thumbs up when he got in.

969 2018-06-14 21:46:57 Yes, they are different. Houston has a lot more black culture and high rollers ( oil and gas ). Easier, slower pace here though we’re the 7th largest city in US.
970 2018-06-14 21:46:48 We have thousands of years of cheap oil left.

973 2018-06-14 21:46:32 I had to move to an oil cleanser because anything that striped oils, even a tiny bit, caused my skin issues to flare up. It's been an adjustment because it literally feels like you're cleaning your face with canola oil.

979 2018-06-14 21:46:07 hello kinda nsfw but i guess also helpful?? The skin oil at kruidvat really helps against an ichy down there after you shaved :)
980 2018-06-14 21:46:06 The pipeline would be put in place to ship it outside of Canada, not to provide Canada with oil and gas.
981 2018-06-14 21:45:58 The rate at which they're going down, they're likely to discover more oil
982 2018-06-14 21:45:50 It was on an access road to an oil lease. I'm not sure who did the spraying and found that it didn't work.

Impericia por pensar que esta transferencia podía hacerse sin chocar contra el iceberg

989 2018-06-14 21:45:28 Saudis don’t have capacity to raise production by 1m b/d to replace loss in output by Iran, Oil Ministry’s news service Shana reports, citing Asadollah Gharekhani, spokesman for parliament’s energy commission.
990 2018-06-14 21:45:23 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
991 2018-06-14 21:45:18 Governments have got to get data to people faster. Highways are still jammed ... ppl buy houses 100 km from Toronto and then commute by driving. It’s suicide. Not enoug trees. Oil transported by rail ... it’s nuts. Ppl fly to conferences all over. Air traffic has gone nuts

994 2018-06-14 21:45:08 I havent tried oil cleanser. I haven't tried many face cleansers at all!

A random one that was fine and the burts bees one that left a film on me, though i think i like their makeup remover
995 2018-06-14 21:45:06 and he said that all of that would be coming from Hillary Clinton...he is a snake oil salesman!!

997 2018-06-14 21:45:03 Nucor expecting 2Q profits of ~$652-668m, more than double a year ago citing "much stronger market conditions that we believe have been positively impacted by deregulation, tax reform and higher, stable oil prices." No mention of anything trade related in guidance.
998 2018-06-14 21:44:53 @janesays420 Weren't we just Talking about CBD Pet Oil the other day? What a coincidence LOL  #HempBombs #HempBombsLove
999 2018-06-14 21:44:51 No matter how good of a mechanic you are or how well you've taken care of your car, you can't ever decide you just don't need to change your oil anymore. The basics are always essential.

1001 2018-06-14 21:44:38 There are numerous examples of young children who suffer from seizures who are on 20+ diff. medications w/ still no positive change. they switch to CBD pills or THC oil and immediately stop having seizures. legalizing marijuana will DESTROY big pharma companies.
1002 2018-06-14 21:44:19 GIRL all i do is wash my face, put moisturizer on && then rub coconut oil on my face after i’m done and let it soak in. my skin is so nice right now bc of it
1003 2018-06-14 21:44:13 Buy me oil and I’ll let you win! Buy a lot and you can pick the score
1004 2018-06-14 21:43:53 They need at minimum 2 Ws or 1 top 6 W and a 4C. JJ can play 4C, so a 3/4W is an option too. I would like something like:
93-97-Rattie/Yamo
Vanek-29-98
27/replacement-18-46
Hansen-16-44
I’d also be looking at a guy like Czarnik for 13F or AHL 1C

1006 2018-06-14 21:43:50 @maxlugavere I just want say that your tips on ingredients in salads has been very helpful. My go-to in NY has been arugula, salmon, whole egg, broccoli, mixed berries, avocado, beets w/olive oil & blk pepper.

1008 2018-06-14 21:43:40 And this has made John Ioannidis so sad (in the most charming way). He s olive oil and nuts. But hates poorly designed, executed, and reported science. #Food4Thought18
1009 2018-06-14 21:43:33 Just as a heads up, potency is an issue in North America. You can buy a product that is supposed to be high in CBD & low in THC but it's actually the opposite. Even government approved dispensaries are having this issue. 

Have you heard of Phoenix Tears a.k.a Rick Simpson Oil?
1010 2018-06-14 21:43:33 Don't use the same oil over and over again. It becomes RANCID and creates free radicals.....VERY bad for your health. Especially vegetable oil....it's molecules breaks down faster under heat and light.
So the "hack" above which encourages using oil again and again ain't healthy.
1011 2018-06-14 21:43:27 Charlie. Surprised?! Did you know tha Nicholas has fought against big oil as such? Many know this. Lack of knowledge/investigation on your end? He puts in lots of time for his community. It truly isn’t right or fair to label him as his brother. Each man is different.

1013 2018-06-14 21:43:09 All the gurus I follow use the Garnier ones. Most of them say to not bother with higher end ones.

Micellar messes up my face :( I use Burt's Bees Oil Cleansing stuff because apparently my face can't get enough oil.

1017 2018-06-14 21:42:52 Oh god I'm in a old Canadian bowling alley and there is no oil and my house ball just hooked 50 boards
1018 2018-06-14 21:42:44 Anyone know how to change their oil?
1019 2018-06-14 21:42:38 Federal liberals are very authoritarian: what is forcing new triple capacity bitchumen pipline and 7 times tanker traffic on B.C? B.C.doesn't need all that oil. Much of it is going to be sold to Asia at rock bottom price at great risk for all the Pacific coast, fisheries+tourism.
1020 2018-06-14 21:42:37 Russia has oil. Trump wants oil prices to go up. Don't let him fool you. It was a major reason for placing him in office.
1021 2018-06-14 21:42:37 I just accidentally snorted olbas oil and it’s the worst most PAINFUL thing av ever done I can’t fucking see

1023 2018-06-14 21:42:10 Canada singlehandedly provides 41% of the US oil and therefore the only real contribution to US energy security. If that goes into play (and I hope it doesn’t have to) an export levy will bring the conversation back around.
1024 2018-06-14 21:42:09 She is like an oily, greasy deposit you can’t swill away in the sink- even with hot water and cream cleaner! (This is a simile- I do not pour oil down my sink!!!)

1032 2018-06-14 21:40:58 That they got some woman in the park that played Olive Oil to play Clare Lynch. She quit her day job when fans found out and started harassing her.

1040 2018-06-14 21:39:17 Please can you advise me on the right order for my skincare....facial oil/serum/primer/moisturiser etc
1041 2018-06-14 21:39:16 the more accurate answer is coconut oil/shea butter/good lotion, genetics, and making sure we're not shot in harsh/direct light (even tho I always shoot myself in harsh light )

1047 2018-06-14 21:38:40 If you want to bleach oil for Ofada or anything else without your kitchen smoking and having people cough, once you put the oil in the pot, put salt, cover the pot well and apply medium heat! Leave for 10mins or more... 

Thank me later.
1048 2018-06-14 21:38:33 Haven't looked it up, but the quid pro quo in these agreements was economic assistance for NK, such as fuel oil.  All that came to naught when it became clear down the road that NK was cheating.  Hard to tell when the agreement has no clear cut obligations laid out, as now.
1049 2018-06-14 21:38:32 Mix coconut oil,castor oil and water and spray it on your hairline once or twice a week and dont tie your braids too tight
1050 2018-06-14 21:38:28 I brought the rarri in to get a oil change and I’m still here that was 2 hours ago 
1051 2018-06-14 21:38:22 Why is oil not counted in the trade numbers.....USA imports Oil from Canada but doesn't export oil to Canada. At least not legally.

1059 2018-06-14 21:36:46 Do not trust anything that your local news says about a foreign country. For example, I think that for Trump's decision the price of oil increased. That is something that affects my country, so I can complain or when it does not follow the environmental treaties.
1060 2018-06-14 21:36:43 Oil of greatness is here again, don't miss out.
1061 2018-06-14 21:36:19 Asparagus with 1tbsp of olive oil and some slivered almonds makes for an awesome healthy side dish to bring to a party.
1062 2018-06-14 21:36:12 @RealRonHoward America is greatest when Americans work together, consider themselves Americans first, and put the common good before specific self interests. Vietnam, Watergate, the oil embargo and Carter's grain embargo shattered our country.

1064 2018-06-14 21:36:03 There’s this place by my work that has a base oil change of $20.  Air filter and windshield washer fluid.  All that fun stuff, if you want to mechanics place lmk.  I have an Elantra and it’s like $23 total.
1065 2018-06-14 21:35:57  I know. Fast forward to two in the morning and I’m scrounging through the kitchen cupboards looking for vegetable oil
1066 2018-06-14 21:35:45 Baby oil is the best make up remover
1067 2018-06-14 21:35:32 They also will say things like "soybean and/ or palm oil." It seems like they should be required by law to specify which ingredient went into a food product.
1068 2018-06-14 21:35:30 I just need to find a beautiful coconut oil loving woman that love cooking with 3 kinds of peppers   wya?

1072 2018-06-14 21:35:11 I read recently -- maybe your share? -- how NY City is attempting to sue big oil companies for climate costs. That would be ideal.
1073 2018-06-14 21:35:07 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this June? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
1074 2018-06-14 21:34:48 Have you tried vegan Parmesan? Coconut fat/oil based? Not the same as cheddar or Brie, let’s face it, but it’s the only one I’ve found that is even close.
1075 2018-06-14 21:34:46 It’s not just OPEC. It’s the laws and Non-PatrioticAmerican Co’s. A oil tanker leaves US 100 miles, comes back with same load and price tripled. WTH?

1078 2018-06-14 21:34:20 I tired to avoid it too.  Problem is not everywhere is obliged to say "palm oil" and they just write vegetable oil.  It's really hard to cut out
1079 2018-06-14 21:34:17 Is this a @seanhannity talking point he gave you. Aren’t we a net exporter of oil? How about supporting alternatives to oil instead of using the military to ensure to oil flows.

1085 2018-06-14 21:33:21 Havidan is still selling snake oil. Not enough space in a tweet to correct all the lies he told in that newspaper story.
1086 2018-06-14 21:33:16 How about all you Trump haters an libtards actually do some research on crude oil, oil prices, what supply vs demand is, drive your ass up to a clean coal facility, what oil companies are doing to help reduce global warming etc and stop using yur cell phones.

1089 2018-06-14 21:32:29 im so content with existing. oil really does work wonders.
1090 2018-06-14 21:32:20 Not necessarily a bad thing if you think about the fact that building more will damage the ecosystem. So we slow ourselves down? Not a bad trade off. Oil is an organic material. That means there will be more. We just gotta find it.
1091 2018-06-14 21:32:15 She will always have a career selling "snake oil salvation" to ignorant rubes.

Just like Papa Huck.
1092 2018-06-14 21:32:13 Could not agree more, especially on Bud. He was a snake oil salesman, but he sold the aw shucks baseball fan thing awfully well. He eats hot dogs at a street corner! I think Rob likes baseball less than Gary Bettman likes hockey.
1093 2018-06-14 21:32:10 More outrage over oil and material goods then people being executed on the street. I wish all the oil burns if this is what we have become

1095 2018-06-14 21:32:02 I made the grave error of buying my hubby truffle oil as a treat ‘cause he loves it. As soon as he opens the bottle I have to run to a different room and lock myself in. Utterly nauseating.
1096 2018-06-14 21:31:49 so THAT'S why the EPA has been funding new research into technology allowing us to breathe in oil
1097 2018-06-14 21:31:32 today's amazing pr pitch: We thought this story about a charlatan pushing a totally bogus snake oil medical idea would be awesome "as we get ready for July 4th."
1098 2018-06-14 21:31:27 I got my oil changed right after that at Sears and the first thing they said after they changed my oil was that I needed an alignment

1109 2018-06-14 21:30:15 When their leases go out, PMB will revoke it and give it to bidders/companies who are maybe oil & gas experts. A lot of people who want to kill PMB are the corrupt people of this nation & world at large

No oil change
No spark plugs
No fuel filter
No coolant

What a great car.

1116 2018-06-14 21:29:12 People don’t realize when you’re smoking oil that has too much leftover butane in it, you’re smoking that butane. That’s not healthy for you. People think “oh it’s cannabis so it’s fine” but no, it’s straight butane my dudes, that shit is bad.
1117 2018-06-14 21:29:11 Uh. Did you put oil there? I didn't.
Who put Google in California by the way?

1121 2018-06-14 21:28:45 We can’t remove the fact that oil wells managed/owned by former military men who knew nothing about oil & gas is a sham. They all share the money with whoever is in power per time cos the presidents renews oil wells leases. PMB will revoke it and they know so watch on
1122 2018-06-14 21:28:32 Qz Brent putting in a solid performance today which is gelling well with the physical crude market. Last grades to get tightness is nsea everything else solid. So finally with US realising needs to keep some oil, looks like these Brent spds can break higher.

1127 2018-06-14 21:28:03 I recently decided to avoid buying products made from palm oil, in light of the devastating impact clearcutting for plantations is having in Indonesia. I'm discovering that's easier said than done - palm oil is everywhere!

1136 2018-06-14 21:26:28 Nope, thats done. They are doing some oil and gas work right now.
1137 2018-06-14 21:26:21 I worry that for all the romantic notions of populism it will quickly descend into mob rule, a vengeful lynch mob led by snake oil salesmen.

1139 2018-06-14 21:26:15 I swear Valvoline takes all my money when I have to get an oil change. I need to start going somewhere else.
1140 2018-06-14 21:25:58 I come from a useless wee country called Scotland My neighbour reminds me every day, but, as i pack my bag its getting full,,,,

1142 2018-06-14 21:25:36 State crime - corporations employing illegal immigrants and paying less than min wage to increase their profits
Green crime- I think like not monitoring pollution and disposing of hazardous waste eg bp oil spill in Gulf of Mexico
1143 2018-06-14 21:25:31 Oil cleansing and watching anime at  the same time is so therapeutic 
1144 2018-06-14 21:25:28 Use castor oil and tie it down at night! I used a little bit of aloe too
1145 2018-06-14 21:25:09 Make sure your vessel is full(oil)
1146 2018-06-14 21:25:06 Me again, that would make a fabulous profile picture, it's like an oil painting.

1149 2018-06-14 21:24:52 Deepwater Horizon oil spill was ecological disaster, and the myriad other oil spills! Climate change from fossil fuel usage is THE ecological disaster! Fission to thermal oh really?
1150 2018-06-14 21:24:39 Dairy and oil makes me sing a half step lower
1151 2018-06-14 21:24:17 Finally...all our debts are paid off! Woohoo!
1152 2018-06-14 21:24:07 Warm compresses and consistent light exfoliation will help. You could also try some essential oils like Cedarwood or tea tree oil mixed into some coconut oil, as they have antiseptic properties!
1153 2018-06-14 21:23:57 Bed yoga?! Totally checking this out! And I recently received an essential oil diffuser so I'm going to see if I can find a Calm scent, it sounds lovely!
1154 2018-06-14 21:23:53 Truck drivers(oil tankers) earn at least $1500-$2k weekly in Lubbock Texas.

1156 2018-06-14 21:23:42 And with that extremely suggestive line, he strides into the ensuite bathroom, to run hot water in the large tub. He sits on the side of it, fully dressed, to drizzle in bath oil scented with sandalwood and neroli.
1157 2018-06-14 21:23:42 I hope there are only few ignorant people like you in Alberta or the province is in deep trouble. Harper had a DECADE to diversify Alberta's economy and deliver a tidewater port to hep diversify the oil market, he FAILED, it's simple as that #cdnpoli #abpoli
1158 2018-06-14 21:23:01 Skyler showed me how to change my oil today
1159 2018-06-14 21:22:52 I just did the oil change and other stuff on my girls car in the sun, 98 degrees. No excuses 
1160 2018-06-14 21:22:52 announcing end to oil and gas exploration took neither time or cabinet approval
1161 2018-06-14 21:22:46 Today I found out how much coconut oil is too much coconut oil for my hair. There IS a fine line. #slickback #homehacks
1162 2018-06-14 21:22:37 With their oil ...they offered alot in exchange for a slot .
1163 2018-06-14 21:22:34 Her dad is a snake oil salesman.  Not a preacher
1164 2018-06-14 21:22:24 Buhari cause the recession? My brother does he control the global oil market? Did he fail to save during the oil boom?
Reno better argue with facts and stop making a mockery of the opposition.
1165 2018-06-14 21:22:24 Lavender oil, tea tree oil and rose water bath
1166 2018-06-14 21:22:16 I respect the Ray Allen love but since we talking about hair your boy need some Pink Oil Moisturizer and a good ole brush! 
1167 2018-06-14 21:22:13 There is more milk coming out of Quebec, than oil from Alberta. And now that I think about it, could we trade an Energy East pipeline for a Milk West line?
1168 2018-06-14 21:22:13 It’s a common issue NAT and IPSEC hmm like oil and water
1169 2018-06-14 21:21:58 Sautee'd Greek chicken with garlic, oil, paprika and other spices; spaghetti and meatballs as taught by my Italian dad.
1170 2018-06-14 21:21:58 Maybe they could close down for the afternoon like Starbucks did
1171 2018-06-14 21:21:53 Dear service writers of Toyota, I understand you are tired. 
I, too, began my day early. 
Your sass is unnecessary. 
Sincerely, 
Customer who just wants an oil change.
1172 2018-06-14 21:21:44 OMG
1173 2018-06-14 21:21:22 Oil? Opec?!
1174 2018-06-14 21:21:15 That thing makes Bingo look tiny @mchastain81
1175 2018-06-14 21:21:12 Up so early. Had oil change scheduled. Then working the next two days. With, you know, and business volume we have been tested. Our team hasn’t missed a beat though. Short breaks, No breaks, Days off.... who needs them? The teamwork with my peers has been unbelievable!
1176 2018-06-14 21:21:01 the oil of joy?
1177 2018-06-14 21:20:36 potential output losses from Venezuela and Iran over the near future. However, there have been stronger indications that major oil producing nations will upwardly adjust their output quotas which put energy markets back on the defensive.
1178 2018-06-14 21:20:32 In short, both sides are valuing oil over human life.  That's not acceptable under any creed or religion.
1179 2018-06-14 21:20:28 KAzakhs don't make pirozhki))) they have baursaki - yeast dough fried in oil without filling inside) Many people buy pirozhki, not all the people make them at home - it takes a lot of time to cook them)
1180 2018-06-14 21:20:21 Possibly an oil change

1182 2018-06-14 21:20:13 Next time any of them lay hands on you,  get palmcanel oil  rub it on it and place a curse
1183 2018-06-14 21:19:56 The ones with or without billions of pounds worth of oil?
1184 2018-06-14 21:19:56 Don't partially hydrogenate my oil, bro!
1185 2018-06-14 21:19:50 is it that weird?
There's probably still a wild greens faction. And a protest even you get arrested faction. A let's send a former green leader out swimming too close to oil prospectors faction. A Metiria was right to illegally claim welfare faction, etc.
1186 2018-06-14 21:19:19 If you ever wanna be stressed out when you gotta fart, buy some mct oil lmao 
1187 2018-06-14 21:19:16 Oh, man, you got to go coconut. Olive oil is way too heavy.
1188 2018-06-14 21:18:59 <オイルをぶっかけオイルをぶっかけられヌタヌタのヌラヌラのテカテカにしたろか?
1189 2018-06-14 21:18:50 I am french, grew up in a very strict family especially food wise. Eat what you’re given. Period. BUT... 13hours is totally overboard and crazy. That being said, take out the outside leaves, cut the base, toss in coarse salt & olive oil & bake 400F for 45’. Crunchy and delicious!
1190 2018-06-14 21:18:46 Nope. We have tried every google remedy there is. Alcohol tea tree oil straight hand sanitizer.
1191 2018-06-14 21:18:43 Remember when you blames President Obama for rising oil prices.  We do.
1192 2018-06-14 21:18:41 THC oil, CBD oil and anything to do with cannabis. Stay away from the heavy/addictive pain killers.

1194 2018-06-14 21:18:13 Syrian Arab Army restores control over multiple points on ward oil field; Mu'ayzilah, Tammah, Faydat Bin Muwayni axis in Southern #Mayadeen desert.
1195 2018-06-14 21:18:10 That's ... not a compromise.
1196 2018-06-14 21:18:07 Oh man just like seeing the blocks have that massive hole in it with all the oil and coolant draining out
1197 2018-06-14 21:18:00 If you live on an island, you don't chop down all the trees to build a platform against a rising tide. You build a boat. Oil and coal will and should be used, but with a strategy of ongoing remediation and sustainable energy running tandem. The two are not incompatible.
1198 2018-06-14 21:17:49 Baby Oil On a Pole Match
1199 2018-06-14 21:17:44 Synesthesia. Sometimes it’s pleasant and sometimes it’s not. I taste my essential oil today.  Not great.
1200 2018-06-14 21:17:42 So many reactionary people have Golovin avis and want him in because of one decent performance against Saudi Arabian oil merchants looooool sums up our fanbase
1201 2018-06-14 21:17:41 Idk if this is too late to help but tea tree oil works. Also @aloovibes recommended a bread/milk poultice in her skincare thread and I have seen it work on most people.
1202 2018-06-14 21:17:40 I just completely soaked myself in baby oil 
1203 2018-06-14 21:17:38 it is best to book supply chain GHGs to end-user location (I'm actually OK with that), you must do that for all energy products, not just power. California steals baseline from historical out-of-state power suppliers, then does the opposite for outside suppliers of oil & gas. ..5
1204 2018-06-14 21:17:30 bring the tanning oil 
1205 2018-06-14 21:17:28 I haven’t been able to play events at all before, I have 8022 oil right now, I tested my internet which seems to be my problem.

1211 2018-06-14 21:17:03 My neighbors son just poured gasoline down the oil tank on his brand new zero turn mower. #liveandlearn
1212 2018-06-14 21:16:54 First, we threaten sanctions against the Saudis.  That takes care of the violence on their end.  The Houthis, in turn, must tell the UN us where they get their missiles and instructions to fire.  Seems to be related to oil prices.
1213 2018-06-14 21:16:42 I think it's more possible to have that attitude now (if you want it) than 30/40 years ago when British food was crap. Now we have bread, oil, cheese, wine, even charcuterie  to rival anything from the med.
1214 2018-06-14 21:16:17 I need to go to Walmart to get lani some coconut oil && a silk head scarf

1217 2018-06-14 21:16:03 Transit in Dubai airport. Sadly no stock of my beloved sandalwood oil. 

Still. Less than 24 hours to seeing @spconnolly's epic Cesare. Travel gods willing.
1218 2018-06-14 21:16:00 Check your Engine oil this morning.
1219 2018-06-14 21:15:41 You know it’s been a long day when you go to put oil in your call and you put the funnel over the dipstick opening instead of the real one. 
1220 2018-06-14 21:15:36 Highlights got me like the Saudis are known for oil not football...very poor #WorldCup
1221 2018-06-14 21:15:26 H is designed for a peaceful,quiscient audience,which implies that the audience's basic needs are addressed.Despite global oil prices falling,end consumer sees high oil prices,cost of living,most digressions wrt women&children,least job growth,no labor reforms,lost opportunity
1222 2018-06-14 21:15:23 I bet you that handshake between #putin and #MBS was a bet. Some oil well thins
1223 2018-06-14 21:15:13 first thought about how hot it is: my coconut oil is going to melt!
1224 2018-06-14 21:14:42 By no means is James Comey a saint and he’s done some shady stuff, but until the day I die, I’ll believe that a former FBI Director has more credibility to telling the truth than the bloated snake oil grifter occupying the WH.
1225 2018-06-14 21:14:39 Why don't you all celebrate by ordering some Chick-fil-A from that $43,000 cone of silence @ScottPruittOK uses to solicit bribes from oil execs?

Re: A fellow's expectation of #US #Oil dropping to 61.8 before #OPEC meeting on June 22
While it's difficult for #WTI to creep up much higher from this level, an outright free-fall to 61.8 in 5 trading days is to be a tall order if not impossible.
1229 2018-06-14 21:13:31 Not even cod liver oil is going to help you with these predictions

1233 2018-06-14 21:13:04 There’s PLENTY of oil left to use.

PLENTY.

Solar is simply better. Don’t let your emotions be your guide when discussing subject primarily dealing with data & facts...
1234 2018-06-14 21:13:04 I tried a margarita for the first time today and that shit tasted like spicy motor oil, whoms't-

1238 2018-06-14 21:12:23 Europe Is Awash With Oil Stored On Ships
 
While many analysts and agencies have already called the end of the global oil glut, oil held in floating storage in Europe is at an at least 18-month-high...
1239 2018-06-14 21:12:23 “after-all venture investment is more meaningful than the oil riversAnd our hearts beat in pace.
1240 2018-06-14 21:12:23 Last year I wiped olive oil on the feeder post. It was fun watching the squirrel climb up, then slide back down. Couldn't keep doing it though. 
1241 2018-06-14 21:12:19 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyLaMHBCH7M.twitter
1242 2018-06-14 21:12:16 I think you'll find that it is our oil, food, fish, land etc. Scotland is a territory of ours and therefore we own the resources. Time to face facts that #IndyRef2 and Scottish Independence will never happen. Tally ho!

Why? Inflation on the rise

Those are the four items that the man in front of me at Dollar General purchased
1247 2018-06-14 21:11:43 that spice mix on delicata squash and kabocha is actually heaven. keep the skin on the squash (just wash it) and clean out the seeds, toss it in this mix with some oil (I use avocado or coconut) and roast at 350 until tender and enjoy!
1248 2018-06-14 21:11:35 U.S. creates tensions by telling Saudis to ramp up oil production while Iran gets sanctions.  This war is about oil...and the U.S. can easily do something about it.  But Iran must show it value life and fairness.
1249 2018-06-14 21:11:35 They will murder as many Syrians as they have to in order to steal the Oil on the orders of the City of London/ The Rothschilds!
1250 2018-06-14 21:11:31 Yes. 

I believe it was the Genie Oil thread I was sharing with him when he was discussing geopolitcal sheeeit.

1259 2018-06-14 21:10:03 Once I went from shaving to waxing, it's much less of an issue for me! I know they make gentle exfoliating pads specifically for them, but I can't personally vouch as I've never used one. If you don't want to go out and buy those, try tea-tree oil!
1260 2018-06-14 21:09:54 Needa get bertha an oil change.
1261 2018-06-14 21:09:49 I shaved with olive oil today and my life is forever changed I have lived in the dark but now, now I have seen the light
1262 2018-06-14 21:09:48 You know you can die of diarrhea, right? Weed already has properties as a laxative in its oil. Youd be making a Poopy Death Cake.
1263 2018-06-14 21:09:48 SA needs imports. We can't stand alone. If imports of oil stop, the country will crash. If the value of the rand goes down, everything becomes more expensive, everyone becomes poorer. Socialism has destroyed African economies. Only Afr economies growing now are free market. Fact
1264 2018-06-14 21:09:40 We are an embarrasment to the entire world.  Trump is nothing but a simpleton & snake oil salesmen

1268 2018-06-14 21:09:28 So verdict on my car: got my oil changed. One of my battery connectors needs to be replaced and a bunch of nuts/bolts around my muffler are rusted. Would be about $4k to fix. Soooo new car?

1275 2018-06-14 21:08:47 Really about to ask my friend to come outside just to put oil in my car for me
1276 2018-06-14 21:08:45 The answer is simple - because England needs Scotland’s oil revenue. Explaining that is what’s hard.
1277 2018-06-14 21:08:15 Nothing’s better than going outside to tan, then coming inside to shower all the tanning oil off, and the. go into your ac filled room and take a nap

1280 2018-06-14 21:08:00 5 minutes of @kalithe in the kitchen and a pan of oil is on fire... I'm excited for this dinner ;P.
1281 2018-06-14 21:07:55 Start taking fish oil pills they're good for your memory
1282 2018-06-14 21:07:53 How many ferries, boats, tankers, etc etc are going through this right now? And where is your source on our low grade oil no one wants?

1286 2018-06-14 21:06:53 Ryan's been a #NeverTrump-er from the get-go. After years  top dog on John Boehner's lap, how could he be anything else? I knew the moment he decided to run. It was the day he stopped criticizing Trump publicly & began talking as if he supported him. The boy is snake oil smooth.
1287 2018-06-14 21:06:51 I love how Uncle Ric sounds like he just had major dental work done, and all he can eat is butt covered in baby oil from Golden Corral.
1288 2018-06-14 21:06:30 Timothy Mitchell’s “Carbon Democracy” backs up a lot of what you’re saying! Mitchell argues and gives evidence that suggests oil companies have always manufactured scarcity to maintain high profits.

1309 2018-06-14 21:03:19 Yesterday, Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported an inventory reversal. Specifically, U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 4.1 million barrels & gasoline declined by 2.3 million barrels.

1314 2018-06-14 21:02:52 So, no worries about oil being gone in either of our lifetimes. So, conserve, work on alternatives and fusion but relax. Long term problem not a cause for panic.

1317 2018-06-14 21:01:59 Is there a more discouraging endeavour than looking for work? Finishing an MSc in an applied science... just racking up rejection emails. Upstream oil & gas experience counts for zilch I guess.

1319 2018-06-14 21:01:42 As a adult but not old person, researched this over and over. Basically only data I trust was from a retired rich old guy oil company executive that said many centuries of oil left even with increased use.  Guy was near 80 and no future so no reason to lie.

1342 2018-06-14 20:59:06 I feel so accomplished today!!! (And broke) 

I got my oil changed, my brakes and rotors changed, and finally got my car insurance figured out $320 later
1343 2018-06-14 20:59:04 You lie like a dog.

Insurance premiums sky rocketed under ACA. Co-pays too.

OPEC is manipulating gas prices, more oil is being used; not much to do w/ POTUS.

Educate yourself.
1344 2018-06-14 20:59:01 They have oil 
1345 2018-06-14 20:58:55 You missed one

GHANA HAS OIL
1346 2018-06-14 20:58:44 Russia sells oil itself
1347 2018-06-14 20:58:37 Well I can, but you can also read it up. Proven oil does not equal total oil. Just oil that's economically viable. See Venezuela as an example and it's stats. And on this note I'll be ending this discussion
1348 2018-06-14 20:58:28 Keep the heat low to medium and don’t use too much oil. If you’d like a refund to PayPal to try again please let me know.

1356 2018-06-14 20:56:43 What about helping to fix the problem in the countries that they are fleeing? The drug cartels are why they run, yet because they don't have oil reserves, the almighty long sausage of the USA doesn't bother to mushroom stamp them out of existence.
1357 2018-06-14 20:56:40 There's a body oil I saw in q-care that might be good for this. Can't remember the brand but I think it was neutrogena
1358 2018-06-14 20:56:31 for fish, i don't really add anything except a little avocado oil and maybe a pinch of salt, though i always add tarragon flakes for salmon bc i love the taste
i always cook in tinfoil in the oven though bc it's easy clean up and an even cook 99% of the time
1359 2018-06-14 20:56:26 Definitely,fracking is not dangerous, but it must be controlled,rules and standards have to be stringently upheld,if oil&gas wells r1-2km true vertical depth and cased & cemented properly right to surface there is very little chance of anything going wrong,shortcuts=problems

1378 2018-06-14 20:53:42 you’re spending more to get oil everytime you come to get gas than you would by just fixing the problem, that’s all I’m saying.
1379 2018-06-14 20:53:39 You seem to assume that Gulf countries really give two hoots about Palestinian cause & that they would "get upset" even if we abstain.

OIC anyway bashes us on Kashmir.

1423 2018-06-14 20:47:49 Yeah, this one event sucks a lot. But it has been 4 years with no oil changes. No maintenance. No anything. Been an absolute delight to drive. I would take that over a crappy ICE car any day. No regrets, just surprised that I finally had a sub par experience

1427 2018-06-14 20:47:36 I have very sensitive skin. Never could let oil touch my face till I experimented with original Argan oil. The thing works for acne and evens skin tone. I dont even understand it.
1428 2018-06-14 20:47:18 If oil is so valuable to life why don't you drink it?
1429 2018-06-14 20:47:07 I got fucking oil stains all over my favorite legging because I dropped popcorn on myself. If you see me in these street don't say shit. I'm aware.
1430 2018-06-14 20:46:53 Money from selling oil
1431 2018-06-14 20:46:36 The article refers to a 'minimal' amount of oil that was deliberately released into the marine environment. How much, exactly? That's a pretty basic question, and should be easy to make known to the public, and not just to marine oil spill experts like myself.
1432 2018-06-14 20:46:16 Not sure if US is vehemently anti-Iran or cozying up to SA for oil.
1433 2018-06-14 20:46:16 This CBD oil got my chill af . i haven't even smoked yet
1434 2018-06-14 20:46:10 Especially if it's oil based dressing - you'll be ready for work, play, or general tomfoolery.
1435 2018-06-14 20:46:01 Carefully sculpting tone to make for receptive audience can seem like a drain on the pursuit of truth. "Why am I trying so hard to not hurt his/her feelings when I'm certainly right?"

But IMO it's not just a frivolous accessory. It's the oil to the combustion engine's piston.

1438 2018-06-14 20:45:17 I only used mayonnaise, that’s made with olive oil.
1439 2018-06-14 20:45:17 Yeah, when Ive been docs about it, theyve just said the olive oil thing, and keeping it warm :C basically, wear earmuffs when outdoors :p
1440 2018-06-14 20:45:14 More like: "Let's flood the market with cheap oil and cripple the Russian economy. Again" X3

1443 2018-06-14 20:45:08 Wouldn't it be funny if when they finished building it, oil as an energy source was as dead as a dinosaur?  Could happen.
1444 2018-06-14 20:45:02 Put a hole in my oil pan yesterday 
1445 2018-06-14 20:44:54 1- "all the oil" has not been used 2- why do you want to use something that only pollutes instead of something that does not pollute and is a lot safer to harness & use?

1447 2018-06-14 20:44:46 Well Saudi gave it their best !! That said , their World Cup is pretty much over before it’s even begun. There will be those though who will say - GETTING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE IS LIKE STRIKING OIL 
1448 2018-06-14 20:44:38 So in WA you can sit in your car while getting an oil change. I feel awkward.
1449 2018-06-14 20:44:38 Sarah doesn't know what she is talking about. Her father was a snake oil preacher.

1452 2018-06-14 20:44:30 I need an essential oil diffuser, an air purifier too.
1453 2018-06-14 20:44:28 The difference is that Trump was a petty grifter who used a charity to launder money for personal gain. Clinton's foundation was taking "donations" from countries and arms dealers who needed SoS approval, as well as oil/fracking interests who she was cheerleading for.
1454 2018-06-14 20:44:17 Yea that oil base spray for cars

1465 2018-06-14 20:41:45 Someone said that the way Russia drilled Saudi, they would soon find oil
1466 2018-06-14 20:41:43 I was looking into Dr Sebi and it led me to black seed bitters. Look up how mucus can impact your body in terms of disease and overall health. It'll have you shook. Then look into black seed oil. I found a place in Canada that sells it online via Google and compared prices

1468 2018-06-14 20:41:26 Yeah it’s a lot of maintenance. I just leave it in a fro by making sure to comb it out & adding grease & oil every couple of days. I do that until I can get braids. I used to straighten my hair but it’s damaged it too much so I’m not doing that again
1469 2018-06-14 20:41:15 Cowards, small little men. To think a low life, snake oil salesman, fraud like Trump has members of Congress so afraid to do their duty. Spineless every one of you. What’s Putin got on all of you, you took an oath to defend the...never mind.
1470 2018-06-14 20:41:07 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
1471 2018-06-14 20:40:52 If the question is can a HP offset oil/gas/propane and reduce GHG than I am not seeing the complication. If the question is can it offset 100% of the oil/gas/propane than yes it is more complicated.
1472 2018-06-14 20:40:52 hehe its okay ! use coconut oil
1473 2018-06-14 20:40:46 Yesss schmidt’s “natural” deodorant made me breakout HORRIBLY and left a ugly ass rash under my arms which left dark marks  I just use aloe Vera and peppermint essential oil now

1476 2018-06-14 20:40:23 Rewarding the oil industry by giving them 33 megatonnes of additional greenhouse gas emissions is the price of having industry agree to sign on to a climate change action plan?
1477 2018-06-14 20:40:12 This girl at my job tried hitting us with the “I don’t need weave, my hair is long” whole time the hair growing out her scalp needs the hottest oil treatment, a good trim, nourishment, etc... list goes on 
1478 2018-06-14 20:40:10 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
1479 2018-06-14 20:40:09 Yea as long as the oil prices low it’s whatever

1482 2018-06-14 20:39:49 What a great Thursday. I just had my second black coffee of the day. I am preparing my nutsack and penis for hard penetration of a fresh 19 year old later this evening. I lather both in coconut oil and slam it down on my bathroom counter repeatedly.
1483 2018-06-14 20:39:45 I agree w/ you in that being the range but it shouldn't be more than a total of $2.5M and even that's a push.
1484 2018-06-14 20:39:30 Sometimes, money can't give results. Despite Saudi Arabia's oil money,they're the worst side in modern day #WorldCup

1998- France 4-0 Saudi Arabia
2002- Germany 8-0 Saudi Arabia
2002- Ireland 3-0 Saudi Arabia
2006- Ukraine 4-0 Saudi Arabia
2018- Russia 5-0 Saudi Arabi 
1485 2018-06-14 20:39:29 Had to consciously hide my noticeable excitement when offered free coffee at my car dealership while I wait for an oil change.. when did I become an adult?
1486 2018-06-14 20:39:24 Good....I never thought I would say it but i missed you.
1487 2018-06-14 20:39:21 Why don’t you tell the Truth? Prices today are just under $67, perfectly acceptable price for oil, not too high or too low!
1488 2018-06-14 20:39:16 So Uganda cannot produce any welders required in the oil and gas industry?This hurts. What are we studying and why are we studying it

1499 2018-06-14 20:37:39 WTF? You must be a fox news reporter. That is just simply not true. We import oil from Canada & about 83 other countries. In 2017, the United States imported approximately 10.1 million barrels per day (MMb/d) of petroleum from about 84 countries.
1500 2018-06-14 20:37:37 Instead of pouring lavender oil in my oil burner I poured it all over my phone I hate my millennial life
1501 2018-06-14 20:37:30 I hate getting my oil changed Bc I know they know that I know nothing about cars 
1502 2018-06-14 20:37:19 Sure.  But this is a holy month. Its the World Cup. All oil related issues will be discussed after this holy month

1505 2018-06-14 20:37:03 There might’ve been between 1000 & 2000 #TransMountain tanker transits from Westridge since ‘57, without a spill.  I don’t think we can extrapolate from this record that there’s almost no risk of an oil spill from a projected 20,000 transits over the course of the next 50 years.
1506 2018-06-14 20:37:02 Why is being in the oil field so frowned upon...
1507 2018-06-14 20:36:46 She doesn't. She is a two bit snake oil salesmen just like her father. She uses the the Bible just like he does to enrich her family.
1508 2018-06-14 20:36:33 It's ok to take my beard oil for my barnet to Italy though! I'll be a total fuzz ball without it!! 
1509 2018-06-14 20:36:01 Old red got an oil change and a full tank. I know he’s loving me rn.
1510 2018-06-14 20:36:00 I said ‘... do you mean cod liver oil?’ and he was like as if I’D said something ridiculous 
1511 2018-06-14 20:35:59 The idea that Dump is spiritual is a load of crap. He's nothing but a snake oil salesman.

1523 2018-06-14 20:35:13 i add eggs to this but you can use an oil and that works as well. the recipe I use is with ghee, but i've also made it with coconut oil, which makes it cook a little differently, but still is delicious. i eat them plain, with a little syrup, or with a berry/fruit compote

Next thing we so deep it in it we're no longer filling the condoms with water but tomato sauce, mayonnaise, cooking oil 
1535 2018-06-14 20:33:45 have you unblocked me you old buggar !???

1536 2018-06-14 20:33:43 I had a similar experience with Pawn Stars and an oil change not to long ago.
1537 2018-06-14 20:33:41 i thought it was pretty obvious.she threw the flare, which ignited the oil soaked walkers, and basically blew up the stadium
1538 2018-06-14 20:33:19 Or XXX glycosides. 
Silicones parabens polyquaterniums etc are a different issues since they stay on your hair/scalp (that’s where the “protection” and care comes from), it can make your scalp produce more oil as well
1539 2018-06-14 20:33:14 He is such a moron. So far he has not succeeded in get oil to market! It's been all talk and BS! I am not comfortable with liberal government touching any CPP money! They borrowed from it for India what is return on that?

1544 2018-06-14 20:32:35 I totally agree with you but the medical doesn't have any THC which makes you high that's why the oil is legal in the UK
1545 2018-06-14 20:32:34 Going by the experience with Oil & Pet products, the scheme could become an instrument for corruption, since Buhari won't be there forever. We could have another crisis on hand, and foundation has been set with this initiative.
1546 2018-06-14 20:32:29 No logical correlation here. We have never said that having oil money would guarantee good results. Is it logically correct to say : sometimes having the biggest economy in the world can’t give result and take USA as an example since they have never won World Cup

1554 2018-06-14 20:31:42 Sorry to inform you, that's the same mess they serve our kids in school. Nutrition and the government are like oil and water, and when @MichelleObama tried to change that, people lost their minds!
1555 2018-06-14 20:31:32 Harper was pretty much selling out Canada in the same way. He just wasn't planning on doing so at the breakneck speed of Trudeau. Immigration might be lower and oil delivered but more things similar than different.
1556 2018-06-14 20:31:30 Learning a skill is one thing and applying in work environment is other. Plus willingness to burn mid night oil. How many do walk the talk?
1557 2018-06-14 20:31:29 when you go for an oil change and turns out you also need a brake fluid change and end up paying $200 :)))) i’m poor no one speak to me

1559 2018-06-14 20:31:11 Some tensioactives are pretty agressive to your scalp and will result in it producing more oil in return. Most of sulfates tensioactives are pretty rough, at all costs avoid sodium/ammonium lauryl sulfate. Organic shampoos usually have stuff like Cocamidopropyl betaine
1560 2018-06-14 20:30:48 Ya mce can’t do an oil change
1561 2018-06-14 20:30:44 Capsaicin is the compound that cause burning sensation in peppers.This compound is fat soluble so palm oil should work fine as she said.Smearing milk or butter on the affected surface and washing latter should suffice.

1565 2018-06-14 20:30:31 The only one chance for Saudi Arabia to win any football match is they should offer oil for winning the match to opponent.There is no any other way.

1580 2018-06-14 20:28:48 and none of these govt fellas have the slightest clue about this. I pity whoever dreams that that oil will change Uganda ! We shall end up with oil that no one wants to buy yet our kids will struggling to pay back these terribly conceived bad loans. SHAMEFUL!
1581 2018-06-14 20:28:46 Until your #ChevyEquinox starts burning oil and the engine stalls while you're in traffic!  They'll tell you AFTER your oil consumption test that your VIN is ineligible for the extended service coverage, so enjoy the "perfection" of paying thousands for new piston rings.

I am so happy & fortunate to be in a space not only that I love  but working with people who have the same views! 

YAY! 
1585 2018-06-14 20:28:07 Is it not 450million to go independent plus trading deals with the rest of the uk and the oil rigs have been sold to Westminster haha, Scotland wouldn't last in my opinion, we are better together but not with a Tory government either, cunts are twisted
1586 2018-06-14 20:28:06 im so addicted to the smell of tea tree oil 
1587 2018-06-14 20:28:00 Rising domestic crude oil production and increased exports are causing a significant drop in net crude oil and petroleum imports, according to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

1592 2018-06-14 20:26:51 Presently, we are producing more oil than ever before & we are finding new reserves every day.

That can't continue forever, but currently, there still is an abundance of petroleum. 

The real reason it's becoming more expensive is because China & India use more & more of it.
1593 2018-06-14 20:26:50 Currently trying CBD oil but not real difference as yet 
1594 2018-06-14 20:26:49 Whale Oil Beef Hooked ?

1600 2018-06-14 20:26:14 I NEED ORIGINAL COCONUT OIL — looking for recommendations
1601 2018-06-14 20:26:14 Mostly acrylic, some oil
1602 2018-06-14 20:26:12 1) organic/clean shampoo : watch out for tensioactives and silicones-like
2) avoid other hair products on your scalp 
3) spend a few months washing your hair less frequently and style it to hide the oil

if you’re a normal person it should get better
1603 2018-06-14 20:26:05 Voy a cargar nafta y le ponen gas oil. Esa es ni vida.
1604 2018-06-14 20:25:59 @noahknoell happy birthday noah!! Hope you’ve come to like vegetable oil! Miss you hope today is all that you’ve wished for and more!!!
1605 2018-06-14 20:25:51 It depends where you use it. For vinegar and oil on a salad, the cheaper stuff is fine. I use this 'extra vecchio' on berries and cheeses but I'll even drip some on a risotto.

1608 2018-06-14 20:25:22 Palm oil ban?
1609 2018-06-14 20:25:12 I like the way @CornerBakery rations napkins like it’s the strategic oil reserve
1610 2018-06-14 20:25:02 So glad my dad taught me how to do things like change my oil, fix a tire, jump a car, and check my fluids. Some of y’all are gonna have to depend on a man, I get to choose 
1611 2018-06-14 20:24:59 This has always been a petty point that holds no real substance. Republican voters were fooled by a snake oil salesman.  Republicans pushed this narrative that HRC was the most corrupt creature ever, even though no investigation ever proved that.
1612 2018-06-14 20:24:54 Top tip from one Brito-Indian to another: have a bottle of chilli oil / chilli flakes and/or Tabasco in your handbag. Or in your office draw.
1613 2018-06-14 20:24:52 Oil prices are just about where they should be at $68 or $69.

1616 2018-06-14 20:24:43 So what are you doing about it?  Could it be that your pulling out of Iran deal is driving oil up?  Aren’t you a grand chess master! LMAO
1617 2018-06-14 20:24:32 If @Chevrolet really valued customer loyalty, they would fix these Equinox oil consumption issues rather than telling owners like us that we're on our own.  The way we've been treated has ensured that this is my family's last @GM vehicle.
1618 2018-06-14 20:24:16 Oo babe! Mga 3:1 ratio ng kamatis to itlog para tuwang tuwa ka hahah dadamihan ko din ng oil
1619 2018-06-14 20:24:14 And yet its more crucial we dramatically reduce our use of oil. We have no choice but to find alternatives.
1620 2018-06-14 20:24:13 Getting my oil changed. Car next to me is also a Kia Forte being driven by someone named Allison. 
1621 2018-06-14 20:24:08 .@realDonaldTrump I have a simple idea for eliminating the trade deficit with Canada: stop buying their oil. It accounts for literally ALL of the trade deficit in goods!

1625 2018-06-14 20:23:33 IEA did not accurately predicted the rise in oil from $26 in January 2016 to $75+ today with further supply side disruptions in face of tight market conditions. Longer term US shale infrastructure bottlenecks will be solved but more immediate loss of Vz and Iran very bullish now.
1626 2018-06-14 20:23:24 the oil in oil-based paint is (or used to be) flax seed/linseed oil. its all the other stuff they add to the oil or water thats the thing....
1627 2018-06-14 20:23:24 Maybe peppermint oil. I know mice and other rodents do t like peppermint oil, maybe it’ll work for possums...
1628 2018-06-14 20:23:22 Yes the parts that are pro oil & gas. The Hollywood Elite can shag off.
1629 2018-06-14 20:23:05 Awww did she at least send you home with some castor oil? 
1630 2018-06-14 20:23:03 Hi there! We recommend gradually adding boiling water until our Hot Oil Treatments melt to a pudding-like consistency. You can try storing it in the fridge and see if it solidify a bit but we cannot guarantee the best intended benefits!
1631 2018-06-14 20:22:56 Eventually you figure it out tho. I like to choose a cup is enough or a little bowl full of it and wash it. And then I like to fry it with oil or butter until it turns golden and then throw in the water until there’s at least an inch or two of water above the rice. Set on medlow
1632 2018-06-14 20:22:47 clean it with sea salt and warm water but make sure to wipe it off after because the salt will dry it up! and if a bump appears use tea tree oil and it will disappear straight away x
1633 2018-06-14 20:22:43 Just don’t ask where she recommends you put the resulting oil, okay?
1634 2018-06-14 20:22:41 The US allowed the murder of 6 millions Jews.  You think Trump gives a crap about Muslims who don't own oil?
1635 2018-06-14 20:22:39  ok I’ll oil it up for u
1636 2018-06-14 20:22:38 I am not sure you can get a high out of the oil... just i keep reading how good it has been for so many people.. it seems a shame a child is being denied it when it all but cured his fits.
1637 2018-06-14 20:22:36 But you are aware that the NDP has no control over the global price of oil no matter how much you wish it to be so
1638 2018-06-14 20:22:26 Lardo, rosemary and olive oil. Potatoes, anchovy, chile. Leek, egg and bottarga. Escarole, fava beans, scamorza. But if we're going for traditional, I prefer margherita (i.e., tomato, mozzarella, basil, salt, olive oil).
1639 2018-06-14 20:22:15 no diane, we will just be paying into a dufferent pot to oil any trade deals we try and make. as well as lerting that countrys people through our borders. ya div
1640 2018-06-14 20:22:10 Lol but when you’re the worlds leading oil supplier you get special treatment lulz
1641 2018-06-14 20:22:03 べんきょおしまい！帰る！
1642 2018-06-14 20:21:58 As we start depleting it'll take more expensive methods to get the last drops of oil, so the price of oil will go up and make electric cars more competitive
1643 2018-06-14 20:21:50 Saudi got that that oil ass whopped
1644 2018-06-14 20:21:42 Actually, somewhere near the Kremlin tonight they’ll be partying after rocking 5-0 on Saudi Arabia. It’s funny. They’re both Oil$Gas Giants. Why the disparity!?
1645 2018-06-14 20:21:40 I hope the new NU gov't is not pro-mining. Yes, we need jobs but entry level jobs are not good enough. The minerals, oil and gas will continue to stay in the ground. We do not need to rush and mine them.
1646 2018-06-14 20:21:35 But sovereignty trumps all apparently, they will ask for the Falkland islands, fish and oil and all that
1647 2018-06-14 20:21:24 I’m going to need a rub down.... with oil

1653 2018-06-14 20:20:30 What are you going to do about it? Impost tariffs on it? Ban imports? Or possibly buy more oil from Canada if you didn't think they were a security risk, dumbass?

I just played that tune "...leaders of tomorrow..." and I am literally laughing. 
1657 2018-06-14 20:20:11 Paired with all the good news I'm hearing on the oil macro environment right now, this looks like a winner.

1662 2018-06-14 20:19:29 It’s very easy - mix 1/3 cup soysauce, 1/4 cup honey, garlic, chili powder, teaspoon minced ginger, 1 tbs oil. Use half for sauce & half for marinade. Let fish soak in marinade at least 30m, cook. Remove fish, reduce other half of marinade in pan till sauce is a good consistency
1663 2018-06-14 20:19:09 A while back I was watching a protest between Native Americans & White people over the oil pipes & a white lady told a Native American to go back to your country. I nearly died. Stupidity is something else. They really think they were here first. Every one came in a boat.

1665 2018-06-14 20:19:02 Lmao you’ll be fine . But definitely check to make sure oil is in your car.
1666 2018-06-14 20:19:02 Agreed @environmondal! Companies can reformulate using oils other than palm that are not only better for the environment but also for health. We need to create more consumer demand for palm oil free foods!

1671 2018-06-14 20:18:28 Until it starts burning oil and stalling while you drive, and @chevrolet denies you a special coverage adjustment to 120K miles because your VIN isn't on their magic list.  Have fun paying for repairs to your #ChevyEquinox on your own!
1672 2018-06-14 20:17:58 I want to believe that this is science-based and not some pseudo-scientific snake oil but some of the claims on their list of things it can fix is setting of some big alarm bells.
1673 2018-06-14 20:17:50 I really need my oil changed

1682 2018-06-14 20:16:58 As you said the price of oil is going up. But you’re willing to speculate on how much future debt might be? That’s the thing with the UCP, if things are going well you have nothing to complain about. Like with the TM pipeline. Kennedy’s response was “me too but better”. Come on

1693 2018-06-14 20:16:09 In the USA, the conflation of marijuana with hemp has allowed the many industrial applications of this amazing plant to be sacrificed at the altar of big oil. To the detriment of the health of the environment we live and breathe in.
1694 2018-06-14 20:15:46 Thumbs up.
Also,don't forget when Trump used other $Donations for that $10,000.00 oil painting of HIMSELF, (which by the way,he hung that ugly picture in one of his Trump Clubs!)=Talk about using $Donations for a Narcissistic Agenda!

1702 2018-06-14 20:14:13 An interesting question to me would be what other contexts are the word tameh and tahor used outside of these contexts. Like "shemen zayis zakh." zakh is used for purity over there by oil. Why not tahor?
1703 2018-06-14 20:14:12 Uses all the oil? You don't have a single clue what you are talking about. There are enough natural resources to last roughly 500 years. That means oil. I think by that time we will find alternative resources. Solar power? Right.

Lumber export business BC, left out would not suffer
Dairy- left out-dispute would have been settled long time
Alberta oil-left- selling old sand oil as is and at a discount, on top must to sell to USA
NFTA,onset,mess?
1710 2018-06-14 20:13:47 That’s circumstantial. Aside from Australia, New Zealand, and Russia, all the white countries are in Europe.

I think if the Iraqi’s were white, Bush would have still invaded.

The Iraq War (II) was about preventing Saddam from trading oil in Euros instead of dollars.
1711 2018-06-14 20:13:38 Saw a current vid on Tx contaonment center for 10-17 yr old boys..using Styrofoam takeout containers as plates!!! Serving burgers and fries: white bread sugar and oil. Really healthy. And eco sound!!
1712 2018-06-14 20:13:36 Borders moved to capture oil

1732 2018-06-14 20:10:50 2/2 Sauté minced onion and garlic in coconut oil. Add zucchini in an even layer & let cook couple of mins; flip & cook a few mins longer. Should get a bit crispy. Squeeze of lemon over the whole thing & serve hot. (Delicious with a fried or poached egg.)

1745 2018-06-14 20:08:51 COMPLETELY Agree.. Higher prices propel its own alternatives.. Global Solar Alliance, for example..Pump & Dump to collect PetroDollars asap, will take oil to its LOWEST level from here..
1746 2018-06-14 20:08:47 Nooo it’s oil of every persons un-insides
1747 2018-06-14 20:08:32 Us is oil self sufficient and has been for at least the last two years    We have cotton and synthetic fabrics. Nice to have open trade on an even playing field  but no business or country can operate just losing money
1748 2018-06-14 20:08:25 I hate waiting to get an oil change
1749 2018-06-14 20:08:21 My mom said we need to check my oil and i told her okay and then she was like “have your boyfriend check it” and I keep telling her I don’t have one but she don’t listen I think my mom wants me to find a boyfriend too 
1750 2018-06-14 20:08:16 While teaching English in Thailand, I saw ugly oil clotted beaches- the potential consequence of allowing this offshore drilling. I don't have enough expertise on the subject to have a definite opinion, but I thank you Tulsi for your environmentally conscious perspective.
1751 2018-06-14 20:08:15 @realDonaldTrump Happy Birthday! And release oil reserves and lower gas prices!!! Thank you

Oil prices have Increased since they lost 5-0 I suggest people refuel your tanks just in case they don't lose again on their next match 
1753 2018-06-14 20:07:45 Guess What!  We dont need Saudi oil anymore in fact we are now net exporters of oil!  

Trump isnt profiting. His Net worth has only decreased since he ran. Crooks make fake news.

Going green in it's current state isnt feasible with our energy demands.  Hopefully new tech soon.

1756 2018-06-14 20:07:33 My mums solution to everything at the moment is coconut oil
1757 2018-06-14 20:07:33 Yeah I think I was being a bit too cryptic. I was referring to how America acts as world Police when other countries oppress people (as a front for hunting oil??). But in this case, there is no one who can enter america and stop them from oppressing people.
1758 2018-06-14 20:07:29 but they had a progressive(ish) Prince first! Oil is their vibranium, aljazeera is their outreach

Plead the blood of Jesus over your people, your compound, anoint your people & stand on God’s Word. Joshua 1:3,5 He watches over Hos Word to perform it! Amen!
1765 2018-06-14 20:06:35 Yes, what the layperson (blissful consumer?) seldom knows is rapeseed is a pesticide & an ingredient in synthetic industrial & automotive oils. Or that seed oil butter substitutes cause blindness & deteriorated vision. Or that McDonalds swapped out good tallow for toxic fry oil
1766 2018-06-14 20:06:34 We'll be adding a new beard oil and body butter to our site very soon! Keep an eye out for details, or subscribe to our mailing list for first dibs. We hope you guys are just as excited as we are!

1770 2018-06-14 20:05:36 Meat is like oil for India, it’s just that they want to control that sector and make money out of it on cost of minorities lynching
1771 2018-06-14 20:05:35 Egg has no place near yam and red oil
1772 2018-06-14 20:05:23 Great idea just be careful with Tea Tree Oil around your pets! Tea tree oil can cause severe problems in animals!!
1773 2018-06-14 20:05:12 Recent studies conducted by the Oil Research foundation of @BennyBOOOOO1 have found trillions of gallons of oil under Iowa
1774 2018-06-14 20:05:11 Republicans want to sign this into law (really, they do!)... but will only sign on if Dems agree on a broader bill to repeal Obamacare, outlaw abortion, privatize social security, further deregulate the financial sector and open up all national parks for oil drilling.
1775 2018-06-14 20:05:11 You can change oil anywhere lol

1779 2018-06-14 20:04:59 Go away until you can believe the facts in evidence, troll! It is because of people like you that we are in the state we are in - you believe the snake oil salesmen over the facts!
1780 2018-06-14 20:04:47 We’re producing enough oil for the US and exporting.  You are #clueless #MAGA
1781 2018-06-14 20:04:36 It’s telling that they report our agriculture earnings in Naira while the oil earnings are reported in Dollars.
1782 2018-06-14 20:04:09 I guess I don't share your view of the naïveté of head teachers - most of whom have battled their way to the position and know their own context inside out. I just don't buy the snake oil argument
1783 2018-06-14 20:04:00 Don't encourage him. You're adding fuel to the fire for him to open up ANWAR. We really don't need to ruin pristine wilderness for more oil.
1784 2018-06-14 20:03:58 Is this gonna happen while you’re hunched over your olbas oil? Or after ur ded

1790 2018-06-14 20:02:57 FYI Russia is one of the leading producers of Oil & Gas.

Indonesia skipped the group in 2008 after they became net importer of Oil & Natural Gas.

1802 2018-06-14 20:01:44 Is this CBD oil? Do you ship to the UK? My dog is on such a high strength of phenobarbital twice daily and she still has seizures.
1803 2018-06-14 20:01:35 That's the point. Proven. Recent studies showed a whole lotta oil in the north. Problem is it's expensive to dig out and not worth the effort at the moment. So yeah, there's less proven oil reserves but there's a whole lot of oil that hasn't been properly investigated.

1834 2018-06-14 19:58:33 Let's hope she hangs on to the political agenda appropriate to her race and gender, and not cave to the powerful SF corporate/tech/real estate tycoons ... THE WAY PEREZ'S INSIDER DEMOCRATS HAVE CAVED TO BANKS, BIG PHARMA, INSURANCE AND OIL.
1835 2018-06-14 19:58:18 I can give you 1000 examples of items that a company uses which investors also buy speculating that it goes up. How about investing in Oil during War Time? Can I sue the US military bc their use of Oil should skyrocket the price during times of War. Is that a US security?
1836 2018-06-14 19:58:00 @OPPOcast @jengerson @Justin_Ling - Jen, you could have served as PR for Harper's energy policy, mentioning emissions intensity reduction & innovation in the oil sands.  What about total emissions & water pollution? Some projects will never be sustainable.  #keepitintheground
1837 2018-06-14 19:57:35 Wait what?!?! Lol oil has nothing to do with who makes it in or who doesn't. The Saudi's football team is trash.

1841 2018-06-14 19:57:07 Why are recent Chinese IPO’s so hot right now? No one fucking knows. Why are oil stocks trading as if oil were at $30 a barrel? No one has a fucking clue. #marketsalwaysright #whoknows #whocares #putablindfoldonandthrowadartinanythingbutoilnames $SPY

1852 2018-06-14 19:55:46 Soviet Union collapsed because of “planned economy” that was just functional. Final nail in the coffin were drop in oil prices and production.
1853 2018-06-14 19:55:43 Gavin Newsome in CA..took money this primary.. from health Insurance, oil..and everyone else..He's compromised. Horribly.
1854 2018-06-14 19:55:32 It looks like someone slapped a nice ass oil painting on his leg!  Looks so fresh
1855 2018-06-14 19:55:22 Truffle oil on fries is a good way to feel quite sick really quickly.
1856 2018-06-14 19:55:17 We love eclectric oil here - the perfect remedy for when you want to cure your pain of burn, but can only really devote five minutes to the task!
1857 2018-06-14 19:54:59 Gee - did you ever consider we should go solar, wind, electric cars, etc and get away from dependence on oil?
1858 2018-06-14 19:54:56 Naw...”increase output! Send the price of oil down!!!” Russia is a producer/exporter that needs the price higher than the Saudis do.
1859 2018-06-14 19:54:50 I literally just use virgin coconut oil and it works wonders trust me
1860 2018-06-14 19:54:27 Went in for an oil change walked out with a new car 
1861 2018-06-14 19:54:19 Expect more false flags and more staged events and chlorine chemical attacks. Lets keep an eye on this and notice the fake news media does not report on Syria anymore. The Globalist want that peace of real estate for independence from Russia in Europe with oil and natural gas.
1862 2018-06-14 19:54:19 It’s so so easy  and I think that’s what makes them 10x better, all you do is spread raw kale out onto a cooking tray drizzle olive oil and a little salt for flavor and cook it for 15-20min. I’m so hungry now lol
1863 2018-06-14 19:54:17 Na blacks dey do suffer work. Arabs busy counting oil money

1867 2018-06-14 19:53:51 Some optimism helps!

1. Ghanian FDI is driven mainly by it’s new and booming oil sector. 
2. Nigeria’s recession plummeted the FDI. Ghana witnessed none. FDI dropped in both.
3. Report acknowledges potentials of Nigeria’s ongoing reforms.

1869 2018-06-14 19:53:34 Would stopping permafrost from melting stop global warming, or just cool oil workers as they drill?
Keeping all the cooling coils cold requires generators to burn oil, so they will increase the market for oil as they drill for more oil.
Brilliant!
Did Rube Goldberg think this up?
1870 2018-06-14 19:53:34 Because they give us oil 
1871 2018-06-14 19:53:25 Plus it’s that time of year. We thought you were opening up more of the USA for oil exploration. Don’t go wobbly, DJ.
1872 2018-06-14 19:53:16 Just writing about the conflict between "data is the new oil" and open data for the book I'm writing this afternoon.

1879 2018-06-14 19:52:34 Supply Management should NEVER be a conservative position.

Question is, why are we defending it so much? Big Oil doesn't have that much power. The Auto sector does not have that much power. Why do a couple of MP seats in Quebec matter so much? I really like to know.
1880 2018-06-14 19:52:31 Some say add oil to water when making pasta, some say don’t do it. What is ATK opinion? #ATKquestions
1881 2018-06-14 19:52:15 There’s no oil paintings in your DP either mate. Faces like a goalkeeper in a darts team 
1882 2018-06-14 19:52:10 Lol!
Every Friday - I BBQ a 2-finger-thick, marinated New York Strip. And fry homemade fries! (And a Tuscan salad for some vegetable-like substances with olive oil.) I'll do it for you anytime!
1883 2018-06-14 19:52:02 Dimethylpolysiloxane, the silicone added to McDonald’s fries to stop cooking oil from frothing.

Always side effects, though. Always.
1884 2018-06-14 19:51:40 Are you certain it is only a 3rd marriage? Because for a 4th marriage you don't even have to empty it of used oil.

1890 2018-06-14 19:50:55 That's just Abacha alone who only ruled for 5 years. Imagine those that spent more years. My brother it's just by the mercies of God that Nigeria has not been sold. If it were possible, these guys would have carried all the oil wells and put in their bedrooms.

Eba picks up the soup like no other swallow and not just the oil like the others
1896 2018-06-14 19:50:30 Well...it's about selling oil to Asia. If the current gov't prioritizes that over people's safety or this inspires another Oka conflict...this gov't is done!

1911 2018-06-14 19:49:02 Stupid tweet, with an attempt to be funny. Russia largely doesn’t import oil, large exporter and produces most of what it uses.
1912 2018-06-14 19:48:57 Additionally, there’s not a fixed amount of oil that comes out of the ground. The higher the price, the more production that becomes viable. Consumption needs to be pushed down. So...carbon taxes FTW?

1915 2018-06-14 19:48:29 It’s sad, The republicans have bullied HRC wit her emails, Benghazi, refused to work wit a Blk president, spewed propaganda to its base which opened the door for a snake oil salesman like Trump to become president who is actually a white collar criminal.

1921 2018-06-14 19:47:28 yes but you have to be riding with no oil for a while

1954 2018-06-14 19:44:02 They also import soybeans mainly for oil and livestock feed because it's cheaper to get it from us than to grown it themselves. Of course now that they own Smithfield they don't have to buy as much from us because they can run their pork operations right here in the USA.

1970 2018-06-14 19:42:13 The problem is not the liability laws per se, but taking things to the extreme. Americans are extremely litigious, thus the problems you describe. But the other extreme is also bad - think of the snake oil medicines sold to gullible souls in the 19th century.

1973 2018-06-14 19:41:51 Gianni Infantino at the #WorldCup2018 opening ceremony, sitting next to the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world’s leading producers of crude oil. Who said #FIFA were all about money ? #Russia2018
1974 2018-06-14 19:41:51 It would be just like me to get free Chik Fil A and spill it all over my car...
And then go home and spill all my jojoba oil all on the floor
1975 2018-06-14 19:41:44 Baby oil!!!! leave it on your skin for like 30 mins and then scrub off!
1976 2018-06-14 19:41:36 Venezuela has oil too,see how badly her economy is doing! We're borrowing at high rates in anticipation that the revenue expected to be got from oil will bail us,i expect it to get worse from there. Western countries r vigorously shifting to other sources of energy!
1977 2018-06-14 19:41:31 I know I mean what kind of tanning oil?
1978 2018-06-14 19:41:18 RT. If Democratic candidates reject oil & gas donations to follow their party's lead, it will look like ONE party is back, and even then only on this matter. The plural form of "party" I used in the previous tweet was me getting a little too excited and ahead of myself.
1979 2018-06-14 19:41:13 If you’re broke, don’t go get your oil changed. $50 later and I’m officially broke-broke. 
1980 2018-06-14 19:41:13 I shaved with that baby oil gel, yes it works smooth as hell BUT messy and I still felt oily and dirty after my shower lmfaoooo
1981 2018-06-14 19:41:12 I broke the glass on my pen so I’m just gonna use the oil to make tea and get high as fuck. Ugh.

1985 2018-06-14 19:40:50 I can't say too much about diesel since the only experience I had was because a former friend of mine had a diesel golf that was modded to run on cooking oil, was barely able to stagger up to 120km/h
1986 2018-06-14 19:40:49 Have you tried CBD oil to help calm your dog down?
1987 2018-06-14 19:40:38 Lmao go get that oil change sis

1995 2018-06-14 19:39:51 This is bad news for them. They are now pissing off their base by going against what they campaigned. All after already being hated by the Conservative, oil loving, climate change deniers (aka Alberta).
1996 2018-06-14 19:39:50 -Climbing back up onto the bed and kneeling next to your hip he opened the small bottle of vanilla scented oil and poured a bit between his hands warming it up. “Going to start with your shoulders.”

1998 2018-06-14 19:39:41 Look very careful at natural medicine
Cannibis oil,whoops.
Also check the price pay for cancer treatment charged to our NHS.
And drugs used in NHS are charged extortion prices.

2002 2018-06-14 19:39:29 Everybody at the Jeep dealership loves me lol they called me like it’s time for an oil change Binda get down here 
2003 2018-06-14 19:39:19 when the express oil change guy berates you for being 5k miles over and you can’t even be mad bc he right LOL
2004 2018-06-14 19:39:15 Multiple doctors Rx multiple meds. I wish I took less meds!  Behçet's Disease can cause all sorts of bad stuff, including blindness and stroke. I have no choice really on most meds. I could choose not to take pain medication (non-narcotic). I take hemp oil and it rocks!
2005 2018-06-14 19:39:09 $spy still like oil here fwiw ;-)
2006 2018-06-14 19:39:00 i'm 2,000 miles over my oil change 
2007 2018-06-14 19:38:57 Oil prices aren't high because of OPEC. You destabilized the Middle East, broke Iran treaty, promotes ongoing blockade. Your tariffs are really helping Americans aren't they. Because of thoughtless decisions. You have once again screwed the US, allies & the world. Bad politics.
2008 2018-06-14 19:38:53 We might wish to consider what the real spare capacity is in worldwide oil production.  If there is little spare capacity then it doesn’t make a lot of sense to try and pump every well.  Safe prices are better than highly volatile to the upside prices.
2009 2018-06-14 19:38:50 Sitting here getting an oil change and these two guys who just met are offering each other advice on property investments and these little moments give me hope for humanity.
2010 2018-06-14 19:38:34 A part of him relaxed slightly at your words, he knew you still had been violated but at least not that way. “Anything you want Mick.” He let his hand trial down your leg and gave your ankles gentle squeeze before moving to get the oil.-
2011 2018-06-14 19:38:31 I hear you Calvin. No reports of it down in the US. Hopefully the positive oil continues in Canada,,,,
2012 2018-06-14 19:38:24 I had nerve damage at back of my nose caused by GP over prescribing nasal sprays he said I had rhinitis wouldn’t refer to ENT so had to go private. It’s getting better and the same GP told me to put olive oil in my ears to stop the itching but I had s nasty bug

2014 2018-06-14 19:38:20 $AAPL = ~4% of $SPX. Last time 1 stock so large relative to S&P? $XOM in 2008 ... right before #Oil crashed from $147 to $33. Time before? $MSFT in dot-com bubble ... right before #Nasdaq crashed 80%. Yet story says b/c other cases in '70s weren't as bad, we shouldn't worry? Hmm
2015 2018-06-14 19:38:18 Our total exports have been exponentially higher than any nation we’ve traded with. Our trade deficit has since lowered when Trump took office. The price per product, especially on metals like aluminum and steel, have been far higher than goods we trade for like oil. And we trade
2016 2018-06-14 19:38:04 I promise I wont send a direct message with "hi beautiful. I'm lonely and working on a oil rig. I need $10,000 to start up my business and I'll make u a partner"

2027 2018-06-14 19:36:58 Above-ground oil-fired boilers and furnaces are popular heating systems, particularly in areas that have limited access to natural gas. Oil-fired boilers are efficient systems that are powered by renewable fuels like biodiesel fuel or heating oil.

2031 2018-06-14 19:36:45 I was so excited to get home to my @elfcosmetics package just to open it & see my face oil was in the box. I wanted to use it so bad. 
2032 2018-06-14 19:36:39 Like the US invading oil rich countries?
2033 2018-06-14 19:36:35 Thanks, Nick. Never seen that before. I guess this takes the place of the engine oil flowing through the prop governor in a hydraulic prop then?
2034 2018-06-14 19:36:35 Hey #thefoodfam - tonight we are recording our northern fried chicken, southern grits and a honey bear episode! If you are gearing up for some fried chicken this weekend be sure you pick up a candy thermometer with clips and a jug of vegetable oil! #friedchicken #eat #podcast

The disease (as you call it) is caused by the spread & cross-contamination of Western-funded terrorism.

It festers & proliferates - fed by promises of oil revenue & regionalisation to benefit neighbours - mainly #Israel.
2037 2018-06-14 19:36:14 why life feels good at the moment:

It's summer

I have an awesome summer job

I got oil paints and I can paint at home

I'm talking to a cute boy

I feel very h0#y all the time :)
2038 2018-06-14 19:35:56 Well, that would be for Sco to decide. U.K. sold off oil for quick £ to fund London, not in interests of the people. When your average wage is almost twice as much £9 doesn’t seem so high. Plus they don’t have the associated probs like we do... enhanced by inequality.
2039 2018-06-14 19:35:44 Completely depressing, stick it back in the oven & do some intense cardio then try again! Sudofed spray & Olbas oil but careful with the sudo cos it's mega addictive.. If it's allergies, maybe try Beconase. YOU SHALL ENJOY YA DINNER

2042 2018-06-14 19:35:26 Coconut milk or coconut oil organic inside a cuppa vanilla organic sugar free coffee is brilliant. Try it sometime. It's delicious.
2043 2018-06-14 19:35:23 You should have let Saudi Arabia get at least one goal Russia, instead of running up the score 5-0, because now they're gonna cut off your oil supply  #WorldCup⁠ ⁠ #RUS⁠ ⁠ #KSA⁠ ⁠
2044 2018-06-14 19:35:22 Face currently looks like an oil grease  looks like my Fenty primer no longer works so that’s sad
2045 2018-06-14 19:34:44 No it's not, the military iv drip was increased, haven't touched big agriculture subsidies, oil subsidies, they just do welfare in a grander, more insidious way, hide it in the fine print, under the guise of "patriotism". What bothers me about it, the lying, disinformation.
2046 2018-06-14 19:34:37 Unless we stop breathing and drinking the water, no amount of taking care of ourselves gives us an advantage given Republican big oil deregulations.
2047 2018-06-14 19:34:33 Refresh my memory, wasn't some of the charity money also used to buy that garish oil painting of Trump?
2048 2018-06-14 19:34:23 @SanLeandroCDJR , Extremely disappointed with their customer service. After numerous texts, calls, and emails I still do not have my second key, registration, or paperwork for my anti theft device, not to mention the two year oil change program promised.
2049 2018-06-14 19:34:11 Where are your morals for gasoline and oil??
You’re supporting the countries that chuck gays off rooftops.
I don’t think Chiku-fil-a does that
2050 2018-06-14 19:34:04 He has to go for letting  down the Country he's meant to represent and Scotland is supposed to be in an equal partnership where when has it ever been equal oh yeah you make the oil well take the money were mugs

2056 2018-06-14 19:32:53 Vanessa you should not take all tweets personally. But you would agree with me that the outcry regarding the oil battle is much more than that regarding the disastrous plight of a thriving city
2057 2018-06-14 19:32:48 Oil prices are not too high. Our dependence on fossil fuels is too great. Our attention should be on the technologies of the future. Climate change is real; Donald Trump is a fool.
2058 2018-06-14 19:32:48 IF WE CANT DO THAT THEN WERE REALLY  STUPID

WE HAVE MORE MINERALS, OIL ,GAS, NATURAL

2066 2018-06-14 19:32:04 Marriage leads to deep questions, like “What the fuck is an essential oil? What aisle would that even be in?”
2067 2018-06-14 19:31:55 I told u I wanted 10 goals and an oil pipe line for god sake man!!!!  
2068 2018-06-14 19:31:40 Why use oil when you can use ghee, I always say.
2069 2018-06-14 19:31:31 Bacon  flavored CBD oil works great on dogs to calm them and will come in handy with July quickly approaching!!!
2070 2018-06-14 19:31:24 I've never, ever had a mower that needed oil added more than once a year. To say that this failure is my fault and not cover the repair is callous, greedy, and very poor customer service. @TroyBilt has already reached out. Maybe they'll step up where @Lowes is falling.

Trump's only interest in the whole of Korea, North n South, is to tap the so far untouched reservoir of minerals, oil, etc. Sure he'll give Korea a token, But he'll take cream. A gold mine. Hmmm
2077 2018-06-14 19:30:07 Gas burning so fast I be thinking I need an oil change.
2078 2018-06-14 19:30:02 The cap to my fave @bathbodyworks oil sliced my finger open and the oil mixed with the blood  oh ohhh. I feel BETRAYED
2079 2018-06-14 19:30:01 The UK did the same thing during the Biafran war. They secretly supplied arms to Northern Nigeria in exchange for oil coming from Biafra.

2084 2018-06-14 19:29:32 i would rather get a billion shots than go get my oil changed
2085 2018-06-14 19:29:20 Yeah F!U! OPEC! They strong armed Saudi Arabia to raise prices of their oil from below $30 barrel in early 2016 where gas was close to $1 gal, greedy Fuks...
2086 2018-06-14 19:29:14 By 'intensification' do you mean yield increase, or something else? If you have a relatively low-yielding oil palm monoculture, is it best to replace it with higher-yielding variety, or leave & plant a new area with high-yield palms?
2087 2018-06-14 19:29:00 Vodka > Oil
2088 2018-06-14 19:28:57 pretty much, stay away from soy, rape seed oil, palm oil... any oil really. they make your haemoglobin stick together reducing the oxygen carrying capacity of your blood sites
2089 2018-06-14 19:28:50 CBD oil can calm anxious dogs
2090 2018-06-14 19:28:43 Yawn! See if anyone cares. We've got the recipe for shortbread, we can get whisky from Japan, Nessie doesn't exist and the oil's running out. When are you leaving?

2094 2018-06-14 19:28:27 Technology was a mistake.
2095 2018-06-14 19:28:14 Economic argument? We’re a nation of 5 million people yet our oil alone makes up 1/3 of UK total exports, out whisky industry is worth billions annually, our universities are ranked top in the world. You’ve been brainwashed into thinking we’re not capable of being a county.

2106 2018-06-14 19:26:35 Tell me about it. I dropped $600 at the dealership yesterday for new tires and a oil change. Then they told me on my next oil change I'll need the 30k maintenance that cost about $500. Cars suck.
2107 2018-06-14 19:26:29 Russia be like you have more oil and we have more goals. Russia dwell on comparative advantage .

2108 2018-06-14 19:26:24 Getting OPEC to lower the price of oil is the one key ingredient of kicking this economy into high gear. Let’s cut our dependence on foreign oil and that will force them to lower prices.
2109 2018-06-14 19:26:20 Lmfaoo wait. Niggas don't like oil/ lotion their meat ? Y'all shits just be ashy??? 
2110 2018-06-14 19:26:07 One of these days, we're going to see "water" right up there, in the news, among the commodities, with oil.  Between climate change & pollution, our clean water sources are in danger. May sound like hyperbole, but ask Cape Town how they're doing.
2111 2018-06-14 19:26:06 You lack fish oil
2112 2018-06-14 19:26:04 Like Mo Salah being used in Chechnyan propaganda
& Ozil & another German-Turkish lad meeting up with the genocidal leader.

This World Cup is insane already 

The oil vs oil match with Fifa sitting next to two insane murderus people.
Mate, this is a joke.
Can’t wait for Qatar

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
2114 2018-06-14 19:25:49 .@realDonaldTrump When have you ever put gas in a car? You have no clue what barrel oil prices have to do with anything.
Ignortant bastard
2115 2018-06-14 19:25:46 The same, but really good butter instead of the oil (this is one of many reasons why I'm not a world class professional athlete).
2116 2018-06-14 19:25:41 We've got the recipe for short bread, we can buy whisky from Japan, Nessie doesn't exist and the oil is running out.  Give the English a vote in Indy 2 and you can guarantee they will get it

2119 2018-06-14 19:25:19 The life I want to live won’t be cheap and I’m a lazy pos. That’s like trying to mix oil and water 
2120 2018-06-14 19:25:14 Have you tried the thc oil in a vape pen for help with your pain ?
2121 2018-06-14 19:25:09 Information is super important, but I think you’re over stating it a bit. Physical resources are still very important: wars are regularly fought over access to physical resources like oil, trading routes, water, and farmland.
2122 2018-06-14 19:25:06 real truffles are a bigger scam than truffle oil.
2123 2018-06-14 19:24:50 When you discuss commercial vegetable oil sprays such as Pam, you mention that those sprays use lecithin as an emulsifier. If I were to add dietary-grade lecithin to my vegetable oil in the right amount, would that work well in my spritzer? #atkquestions

2126 2018-06-14 19:24:40 Before the Euro bears get too excited, they should recall Trump’s tweet to OPEC about increasing oil production when Brent was at $80. #currencywars

2130 2018-06-14 19:24:06 Not on twitter but I get a lot of FB friend requests from “widowed” men, “military” or men working on “oil rigs in Scotland”. I report them to FB as fake accounts.

2132 2018-06-14 19:23:25 Need to whine more.
His policies on trade and oil make have added so much to the cost of living for those who earn less than $30,000 a year, that his tax breaks for us look like a flea on an elephant's ass - and they expire in 5 or 6years.
Big  $!/&#$ deal!!! Damn LIAR!

2138 2018-06-14 19:23:04 try argan oil colors!! I can go a couple months without redying my hair blue and it barely even fades
2139 2018-06-14 19:22:54 No salt, no sugar, no oil, butter UNLESS ITS COMING FROM A FRUIT OR VEGETABLE NATURALLY
2140 2018-06-14 19:22:51 When u say resources does that include oil??? I thought you’d of give up with that one! If people believe in Indy I’d have more respect if

2142 2018-06-14 19:22:42 After seeing this ad like 30 times in 2 weeks, it's time to mute. Scented water shouldn't cost more than oil.
2143 2018-06-14 19:22:40 2.What can robots do for humans?
A kind of care and companionship. But most importantly, it can be done smoothly under conditions that humans cannot tolerate. Such as oil extraction or scientific experimentation.

2144 2018-06-14 19:22:39 We’re playing the game called how long can I go without getting my oil changed before my engine seizes
2145 2018-06-14 19:22:29 Having large oil reserves and being the biggest oil producer are two different things..

2154 2018-06-14 19:22:06 Every time I come to this bitch it take these niggas 2 hours to change my oil
2155 2018-06-14 19:22:04 there's actually plenty of oil to go around - in fact the natural processes that made oil continue to do so as well...….
2156 2018-06-14 19:21:52 I had created a wonderful summer body oil today!! I think this is gona be my best seller for the summer!! SUMMER PROJECT COMING NEXT MONTH. 
2157 2018-06-14 19:21:45 You are a shill for a liar, a racist and a snake oil manufacturer. You divide America to get rich and your ideas never take into consideration the health and well-being of Americans. How long before Trump has a hotel in NK?
2158 2018-06-14 19:21:40 Agreed! If I use anything it’s some essential oils mixed with coconut oil.. fragrances are the new "smelly" to me.
2159 2018-06-14 19:21:40 Truffle oil fries taste like sweat.
2160 2018-06-14 19:21:34 Russia has oil
2161 2018-06-14 19:21:13 Uhuh sia maigad nak nangis sia fikir balik HAHA so much oil mmmm
2162 2018-06-14 19:21:03 I’m assuming your info is still coming by the same media outlets owned by big oil.

2167 2018-06-14 19:20:17 if you dont have allergies to nuts i highly reccomend tamanu oil to help with healing, it helps get rid of the dark spots left after the scab heals, it also makes your skin really glow, been using it for a couple months now and i can see a major improvement already

2169 2018-06-14 19:20:07 Just the movement of weapons from one nation to another affects the nation's businesses value on the stock market. Oil is the main weapon needed in wars. Even a small disruption in a small nation's oil supply creates a reaction on stock prices worldwide.
2170 2018-06-14 19:20:05 Thought USA had sufficient oil now to not need foreign oil?
2171 2018-06-14 19:20:04 No we won’t! Things will continue as they are, getting more outrageous & monstrous everyday & our Congress will do nothing! Did I mention the price of oil?
2172 2018-06-14 19:20:01 And my initial response was clear. I said the battle for oil is bad. But the weeks of terror for 100 thousand people which has been condemned by Amnesty International (clearly a MB group) is much much worse. The silence was deafening. And repugnant
2173 2018-06-14 19:20:00 HIGHER OIL PRICES..." Wonder if outcome of 1st game of Soccer World Cup in Moscow (Russia 2 - Saudi Arabia 0) could be a subliminal message of what to expect in OPEC (just kidding... I think.. )
2174 2018-06-14 19:19:49 Bearish long term for oil if this holds.

2183 2018-06-14 19:18:24 Bout to get this oil changed
2184 2018-06-14 19:18:13 Convenient. He knows Pruitt’s corrupt, Pruitt knows he’s corrupt but when you’re doing big oil’s work, Ryan lets you get away with it.
2185 2018-06-14 19:17:37 *National parks are turned into gas/oil refineries, trade wars escalated with developed nations, far right conservative judges are seated for life in federal/supreme courts, objectively terrible/unqualified people seated in high positions*

2186 2018-06-14 19:17:28 Oh ya, Lucic for a 7th would be a good deal, not that Lucic the player isn't effective but Gus contract will be crippling to the Oil and they need to get out while they can(maybe)
2187 2018-06-14 19:17:27 And the oil sands emissions are a problem for global warming... Where's the protest group for this?

2189 2018-06-14 19:17:20 Vanessa. I am condemning the silence regarding the slaughter of unarmed men in broad daylight, weeks of indiscriminate shelling on video, and cutting off water to a whole city. So yes it does surprise me when ppl remember terror only when there’s a battle between militias for oil
2190 2018-06-14 19:17:20 like that good ole broadcaster Jason Lewis in whose district the Koch’s have a major oil refinery. It would be grand if their dark money schemes got them in RICO territory.
2191 2018-06-14 19:17:10 You certainly can find recipes that include it but it’s not one of the defining ingredients. You’ll see it in some regions or some homes just as you’ll see breaded and fried versions occasionally (and comminly in the US). Tomatoes and mozz and olive oil are essential.
2192 2018-06-14 19:17:09 Nymex Settles 6/14/18 - CL Jul18: 66.89 (+0.25) (+1.4% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
2193 2018-06-14 19:17:03 Putin is meeting with the Prince of Saudi Arabia. I’m just wondering if the meeting is connected to discussions about oil supplies and pricing?
2194 2018-06-14 19:16:49 I bet the country's rulers waged oil prices.
2195 2018-06-14 19:16:46 Use black charcoal mixed with bentonite clay equal amounts of both. Mix both with 3parts water and 1 part raw apple cider vinegar. Use as face mask.let dry & Rince. Buy tea tree oil from clicks and apply to the pimples with cotton wool. Then after 20mins apply face moisturizer
2196 2018-06-14 19:16:44 I imagine historians/ investigative reporters are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of lies and atrocity is mind boggling. They must be exhausted, I am!!!!
2197 2018-06-14 19:16:28 Saudi Arabia neew to buy a new Country with all that oil money
2198 2018-06-14 19:16:24 Basically you swish coconut oil around in your mouth for 5-20 minutes then spit it out. It prevents bad breath, heals/prevents cavities, & whitens your teeth!
2199 2018-06-14 19:16:18 If I were, I would want you to end my suffering by frying me in hot oil.
2200 2018-06-14 19:16:18 I like garnier fructis sleek and shine and seal with your fav oil.
2201 2018-06-14 19:16:17 Well, you could bomb their homes for oil. That one's up there.

2206 2018-06-14 19:16:06 I tell you, it was not just your average World Cup opening game. Putin made some hot deals for oil.
2207 2018-06-14 19:16:05 @Milbank Canola oil too
2208 2018-06-14 19:16:04 This is so interesting. Also how Indonesia? Oil?
2209 2018-06-14 19:16:03 U.S. oil prices mark highest finish in two weeks
2210 2018-06-14 19:15:56 Their Oil does go a long way to fuelling the world.  A whopping 13% of total production in the world.  Imagine what it would be like without their oil.
2211 2018-06-14 19:15:50 Idk how people can go over their oil change, the second my light comes on I start freaking lol
2212 2018-06-14 19:15:48 Got a hot bubble bath going with some oil and this blunt I'm twisting 
2213 2018-06-14 19:15:45 Vos sabes que nos subieron todos los costos? Por ejemplo hoy compre fertilizante,mañana Gas Oil, pasado herbicidas
2214 2018-06-14 19:15:42 Oil is ultimately more valuable because of its other uses, in chemical, pharma and other industries. We all need more renewable energies to be brought on stream as soon as possible, not delayed by short-term profiteering.
2215 2018-06-14 19:15:32 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
2216 2018-06-14 19:15:21 Even the simplest human activity requires motivation of some type. Nobody does anything randomly and for no reason. Even getting out of bed requires it.
2217 2018-06-14 19:15:19 You can get fatter, but can you get obese?

I guess that depends on

Salmon vs Whey shakes
Butter vs Sunflower oil
2218 2018-06-14 19:15:12 Russia is the largest producer of oil and gas and the entire EU plus a dozen of other countries are dependent on it's exports

2229 2018-06-14 19:14:28 Customer very irrately complaining someone could slip on oil spill while pointing at a spill clearly surrounded by orange cones and a sign saying slippery ..one which I was attending to with kitchen rolls and soapy water.
2230 2018-06-14 19:14:12 BTW the amazingly fabulous Zhoug sauce is also great mixed with hummus as a dip,  mayo as a  spread or with oil and vinegar to make a salad dressing.  (This all makes it a little less spicy. Cause it's VERY spicy.)

2236 2018-06-14 19:13:43 @TunnockOfficial please stop using palm oil in your caramel wafers! I love them but don’t love the palm oil
2237 2018-06-14 19:13:41 I think the big change is that the nature of the resources worth fighting for have changed. 

Previously it *was* the land, since that was the source of the kings power. Then it became money in the form of indemnities. After that, oil & iron. 

Next? Probably water.

2383 2018-06-14 18:56:48 i just got my diffuser bracelets in but tbh i don't know if i love the oil i bought with it :-// it's super strong
2384 2018-06-14 18:56:48 Just watched the highlights... And.... My post match conference is.... Saudi Arabia are a sack of s**t! (so are Russia)  literally! How do they even qualify for the international stage?? Must have cost them a lot of oil!! #SaudiArabia #WorldCup
2385 2018-06-14 18:56:45 You no See as dem fresh? Dem oil money gang   
2386 2018-06-14 18:56:41 Hmm that's why US is pushing EU to abandon deals with Russia so it can sell them 3 times more expensive own oil and gas 
2387 2018-06-14 18:56:41 But yet you support #45. I see you bought the snake oil from the grifter and his family. The joke is actually on you.   hahahahahahah
2388 2018-06-14 18:56:28 A commercial oil discovery will be made and will be happy to see you all getting employed and taking the game to the next level #Prosperity #GhettoFreeNamibia
2389 2018-06-14 18:56:20 So it isn’t the oil then, it’s trillion dollars of minerals got to be something in it. Remember WMD in Iraq and look how that turned out for the world.
2390 2018-06-14 18:56:07 good luck still in oil and gas?
2391 2018-06-14 18:55:45 Clean your face with grape seed oil and wash it off with a damp face cloth, they’re just white heads I had them on my forehead for yeaaaars and I’m so oily. Literally only thing that’s ever cleared my skin! Also EXFOLIATE! it’s tough dirt under the skin
2392 2018-06-14 18:55:40 nah, only thing free is the oil change. & maaan, i hear what you saying, i promise you i do.. buuuuut i can hold out a lil longer, i just can’t drive as much  i’ll get em fixed before i go to atlanta
2393 2018-06-14 18:55:39 While Turkana oil is being imported already.
2394 2018-06-14 18:55:37 I get that feeling after I leave the boxing gym and after I put on my coconut oil/ Shea butter combination when I’m shirtless 
2395 2018-06-14 18:55:36 リアルで政治の話すると話題多すぎてメッチャまくし立ててしまうorz…引かれてそう…でも話せるの楽しい
2396 2018-06-14 18:55:36 I didn't know there were still "barbers" left. I can't say it's a topic that I've ever given much thought to other than laughing at the hyper macho sport clips with 97 channels of sports on huge tv's with all products in motor oil shaped silver or black containers.
2397 2018-06-14 18:55:26 Some oil fields have more reserves than others :-D
2398 2018-06-14 18:55:22 If trading partner wants the Oil to sweeten the deal... then no. Oilers have  been on the short end too many times lately. Need to win this trade. If ya Can't, play him. Or see if he "develops" an allergy to his equipment.
2399 2018-06-14 18:55:20 The very same girl who was trolling bam comparing vandoras cream to bam  oil.. ...

Hai this originals are bunch of fools shame
2400 2018-06-14 18:55:14 @RandyOrton What brand of baby oil do you use?
2401 2018-06-14 18:55:13 „At least in oil reserves boty countries are equal”
2402 2018-06-14 18:54:53 BEAVER oil....
2403 2018-06-14 18:54:51 Hi Saudi Arabia, you see, all the oil money in the world won’t buy you success...just ask Pep Guar...never mind...
2404 2018-06-14 18:54:43 When you get your car serviced and the mechanic leaves all his grungy remains on your cloth seats and door  Like nigga do you not know you’re covered in oil, grease and filth?!
2405 2018-06-14 18:54:37 They'll go no where,  dumpy said that they were a useful side,  this is why the #WorldCup shouldn't be enlarged. 
They were rubbish. Back to the oil wells with these guys
2406 2018-06-14 18:54:34 International trade, as far as the US is concerned, is just used as a way to placate the rest of the world. We have huge oil reserves in this country, the best industrial infrastructure on the planet, vast areas of agriculture, huge fishing fleets. Again, who are we dependent on?
2407 2018-06-14 18:54:32 This is sicker than the $ 30000 oil painting story.
The #tcot people should go to the mirror and see if the can read the backwards L tattoos on their foreheads.
2408 2018-06-14 18:54:32 I think so -- in the next significant recession. (Or potentially if oil goes crazy as in 2008.) Pretax margins have fallen well into single-digit territory for AA and UA, leaving much less margin for error going forward.
2409 2018-06-14 18:54:20 Venzuela can't eat food
Venzuela becomes socialist, can eat food
Oil market collapses can no longer afford food
Bolivia same deal but they diversify and are more solvent than before
2410 2018-06-14 18:54:18 I soaked my hands in amla oil for 10mins and fokol 
2411 2018-06-14 18:54:18 If you have your own oil, why are you accusing OPEC of price rigging? European prices are because of taxes, not supply costs. And American attitudes are not giving the rest of the world the horn…
2412 2018-06-14 18:54:16 Baby oil removing ur tan is SUCH a lie
2413 2018-06-14 18:54:12 Was one of my stock pics from Gurness not a recent catch. I cooked it raw just with a bit of soy and bog myrtle oil. Tasted much better than it sounds.
2414 2018-06-14 18:54:02 I’m going to use aloe. I hate the way tea tree oil smell 
2415 2018-06-14 18:53:55 @BlueSkyCBC #NAFTA has not been as beneficial to Canada as your guest says. It has hurt just as many as it benefited. It helped with the demise of the CWB that has NOT benefited farmers. We also have been #giving our oil away to the Americans thanks to NAFTA & many others
2416 2018-06-14 18:53:47 @ErikSolheim  @UNEnvironment  how I wish you can come to #nigeria and make them understand waste management. #nigerians let's invest more on #waste. As at 2014 #UnitedKingdom still export waste. We can make more money through Waste. Enough of #Oil
2417 2018-06-14 18:53:45 Sometimes, money can't give results. Despite Saudi Arabia's oil money,they're the worst side in modern day #WorldCup

1998- France 4-0 Saudi Arabia
2002- Germany 8-0 Saudi Arabia
2002- Ireland 3-0 Saudi Arabia
2006- Ukraine 4-0 Saudi Arabia
2018- Russia 5-0 Saudi Arabi #WorldCup
2418 2018-06-14 18:53:44 Try something oil based. Like baby oil or tissue oil.
2419 2018-06-14 18:53:31 Well I’m no oil painting  unless you’re talking impressionist paintings
2420 2018-06-14 18:53:31 Rating? Russia...average, Saudi Arabia...total shite, Vladimir Putin....new arms/oil deals. Just about covers the first game.
2421 2018-06-14 18:53:17 Seriously. There are business angles. Maybe Putin and MBS used it as a chance to talk about oil output?
2422 2018-06-14 18:53:08 Thatcher cut taxes when we had oil revenues. Major continued the trend. Blair shut his eyes. Now we have no oil taxes MUST go up.
2423 2018-06-14 18:53:08 It seems like @Twitter should have a ‘report ad’ option for ‘snake oil’.
2424 2018-06-14 18:53:07 Taking your car to get the oil changed is like you’re being held hostage
2425 2018-06-14 18:53:01 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
2426 2018-06-14 18:52:34 Stop russian gas and oil delivery especially to Germany, now!
2427 2018-06-14 18:52:33 lol I spend so much money on tanning oil
2428 2018-06-14 18:52:31 Curious if anyone using an oil cleanser on their face? I really want to try it
2429 2018-06-14 18:52:23 Hope this loss for Saudi Arabia doesn't hurt the #oil price even further
2430 2018-06-14 18:52:19 Are you in Oslo. If so do you plan to be there. Tough questions need to be asked about Soma Gas & Oil and links to it.
2431 2018-06-14 18:52:14 He also has previous on the hard-working, well-meaning front - he's been in senior roles in 3 oil cos where shareholders were thrown under a bus, but never accountable. How can this tax avoider be the Children's Minister? Like putting Madoff in the Treasury.
2432 2018-06-14 18:52:04 No. The bipartisan issue should be that we allow for the sustainability of our natural resources. But I guess Trump is against clean air and water at the expense of padding the pockets of big corporations like oil companies. Go figure. 

Trump would rather make us sicker.
2433 2018-06-14 18:51:58 Somebody send me the beard oil lol
2434 2018-06-14 18:51:54 The NDP doesn't want Alberta to produce oil anyways. Not worried.
2435 2018-06-14 18:51:52 1)There will never be 3 California states. 2) @GOP is in the pocket of oil corporations..so 3) we the people are voting in November to banish them to the dust heap of history.
2436 2018-06-14 18:51:42 i could never be an interviewer bc some stupid oil exec is speaking on npr & i’ve yelled at my steering wheel twice...if i was in the same room as her she’d be toast...
2437 2018-06-14 18:51:39 @MomsOils is there an oil to heal a ? What about to help w/ severe chronic pain from a bad injury & fibromyalgia?
2438 2018-06-14 18:51:34 We’re expected to know how to cook but niggas don’t even know how to change oil
2439 2018-06-14 18:51:19 The perfect green smoothie:
 
1 cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk
1 cup spinach 
1 inch cucumber
1/3 banana
1/2 apple or pear
1/2 small avocado 
Vanilla protein powder
2.5 G matcha powder 
5g black maca root powder (for guys only)
2 tsp coconut oil 
4 ice cubes 

Ur welcome
2440 2018-06-14 18:51:16 Were higher oil prices a net negative or positive for the US economy from 2008-present?
2441 2018-06-14 18:51:13 .@MA_Senate’s energy bill does not go far enough in preventing the continued use of carbon-intensive fuels — especially after the outsized use of coal and oil this past winter @Sen_Chandler @cindycreem @KarenSpilka @SenJoanLovely @BarrettSenate @Brady_Works #maleg #mapoli
2442 2018-06-14 18:51:01 No, wind, the sun's energy, potentially crops, and waste in a closed-loop economy aren't. Oh wait! Those can all be used as alternatives for oil!
2443 2018-06-14 18:50:51 What do mean by "You don't have a Boss?"... My father died, I am pretty much alive.... If you can't recognise me in this shining bald look, wait for couple of weeks I am regularly using plenty of Parachute coconut oil...
2444 2018-06-14 18:50:44 What is a good non oil based face moisturizer? For black people skin
2445 2018-06-14 18:50:43 Man Mr. Shapiro I just hope ur not really receiving contribution funding from big oil over the people that signals to me ur against us #MAGA
2446 2018-06-14 18:50:22 We import very little oil from the Mideast.
2447 2018-06-14 18:50:19 Score again we stop your oil
2448 2018-06-14 18:50:19 This is why you only vape hash oil

2458 2018-06-14 18:48:56 Oil can do everything  !
2459 2018-06-14 18:48:55 A great all around pest control is Neem oil. To combat slugs, save & crush your egg shells & sprinkle around base of plants they eat.
2460 2018-06-14 18:48:52 Where’s that music “it’s coming down for real”well at least oil is protecting Ella from all of this

2466 2018-06-14 18:48:25 #Oil #imports of #India resulted in net outflows of $ 71 billion in FY18, up from $ 55 billion in FY17. 

In the same period, non-oil imports too went up by 18 % to $ 361 billion from $ 305 billion in FY17.
2467 2018-06-14 18:48:23 Still need my damn oil change my schedule so busy
2468 2018-06-14 18:47:38 while cooking breakfast for my family i got oil splattered all over my face.. is that what i get for being a good person??
2469 2018-06-14 18:47:32 Most I can do is change oil, tires and brakes lmao
2470 2018-06-14 18:47:28 Spilled garlic oil on my top and now I smell like pizza
2471 2018-06-14 18:47:28 Drumpf is trying to align USA with countries most intolerant of homosexuality,  it appears. Also oil and greediness. RESIST!
2472 2018-06-14 18:47:26 Can't buy everything with oil money , well pleased 0-5 scummy fuckers why other countries around starve to death
2473 2018-06-14 18:47:24 It's quite pathetic, scary and sad that Ilaje LGA, an oil producing community had been without power for over 10 years. Light is life! @GOVONDO @NDDCOfficial @AsoRock  and Osopadec should wake up!
2474 2018-06-14 18:47:14 Pentagon finally got a oil stand , hope the prices good
2475 2018-06-14 18:47:12 Im sure fried isnt bad with fry light and not proper oil  i dont follow it religiously

2477 2018-06-14 18:47:06 This guy is nothing but a snake oil salesman in a suit.
2478 2018-06-14 18:47:06 They have oil money 
2479 2018-06-14 18:47:00 Putin put in an order for another 10 million barrels of oil at half time
2480 2018-06-14 18:46:56 If Italy gets EU trade deal cancelled , Canada should promptly re think it’s stance on the Paris agreement . Can’t continue to push out money for foreign causes while being shit on . We should pump oil till Italy is gone . Canada is 2 % of world emissions
2481 2018-06-14 18:46:54 I had the same problem! I just found out that my air filter was bad and it was causing my car to burn gas faster. I got a new one when I got my oil changed. Maybe yours is still good though, just check and see! Some mechanics will tell you & some won’t.
2482 2018-06-14 18:46:51 I somehow got oil paint all up my nose yesterday and I think everything else is gonna smell kinda funky for the rest of my life smh
2483 2018-06-14 18:46:48 Hope all that red meat, eggs and oil does it's job on his arteries, STAT.
2484 2018-06-14 18:46:47 You control the Oil and let me control the gas!
Infantino “Gentlemen, do not forget my kickback!”
2485 2018-06-14 18:46:39 I ain't laughing with u lot about Saudi Arabia getting whooped cos all they need to do is raise oil prices them all the laughing stops.
2486 2018-06-14 18:46:33 Money represents a placeholder for capital. The capital of the world is scarce. There is only so much oil, gold, land, granite, etc. 

The monetary value of this capital can change depending on human perspective but that doesn’t change its abundance.
2487 2018-06-14 18:46:32 Vodka 5-0 Oil

2488 2018-06-14 18:46:32 Russia vs Saudi.1)winner should take the losers oil reserve 2)loser should respect human rights .. this is fair enough  @DonaldBKipkorir @BenjiNdolo @MuthuiMkenya
2489 2018-06-14 18:46:13 Saudi should stick wiv just making oil. 
2490 2018-06-14 18:46:03 Maybe if you explain that we can bury the grain real deep and it will make coal and oil he'll pay attention.   .... But you might have to use puppets to explain it.

2493 2018-06-14 18:45:45 I just want these people to change my oil so I can go home

2499 2018-06-14 18:44:16 The recipients can toss out what they don’t want...
I reuse the old “inners” as rags esp when I want to mop/clean up oil stains working on my jalopy. Then toss them out.

2501 2018-06-14 18:44:12 Nigeria is still governed with an oil dependent mindset. A lot has to change politically to make this happen. Very long journey ahead.

2503 2018-06-14 18:43:37 when i said forcing i meant banning them from meat or foods like french fries fried in meat oil. like tess said if the child wants chicken nuggets he can and if he doesn’t want to eat meat he doesnt have to lol letting ur child eat meat doesn’t mean forcing them to eat meat.
2504 2018-06-14 18:43:37 Snake oil. You swallowed it all
2505 2018-06-14 18:43:37 is oil like always. what is your stand? mr. president the whole world is waiting for you
2506 2018-06-14 18:43:15 Saudi Arabia should just quit playing next two games and focus on oil & moon.
2507 2018-06-14 18:43:09 On the news right now...37% of adults on medication suffer from DEPRESSION as a SIDE EFFECT Why not try 
CBD OIL 
2508 2018-06-14 18:43:00 Very upset from govt. Seasefire, oil rates, now UN s human right report. Pakistan break cease fire every day. Terrorist killed our soldiers every day. Release stoneplaters.  Itni sasti jaan hai hamare solders ki. What answers you have 
Really disappointed from you .shame shame
2509 2018-06-14 18:42:57 I hope it fills up in time for you to put out the petrol and oil fire when the gas canister explodes and ignites those cans! #FireHazard
2510 2018-06-14 18:42:50 Saudi Arabia should quit football and focus on making more oil money.
2511 2018-06-14 18:42:46 The English want (a) our oil exports (b) our whisky exports and (c) somewhere to stick their weapons of mass destruction- that’s basically it.
2512 2018-06-14 18:42:45 Russia does have Oil too.
2513 2018-06-14 18:42:33 I wrote a joke for the World Cup opening match between Russia and Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil producers in the world. But I can't post it here - it's too crude #WorldCup
2514 2018-06-14 18:42:29 @MSGRIDIRON the oil goes into a 5 gallon bucket you save till winter to help start bonfires with
2515 2018-06-14 18:42:28 man I look so goddamn good dripped in coconut oil with no shirt on.
2516 2018-06-14 18:42:24 tanning oil is the reason my finger print won’t work on my phone this summer
2517 2018-06-14 18:41:56 That's rich when all alarmists seem to talk about is the "conspiracy" of "dark forces" & supposed "oil money"  behind sceptics.

2524 2018-06-14 18:41:22 India was was fine with the "Hindu rate of growth" (3.5% GDP growth, and 1.3% per capita growth rate), from Independence right up to 1991.

In 1991, they realized they were screwed, and changed course.

Nigeria is still governed by an oil boom mindset, has gotten to that point.
2525 2018-06-14 18:41:22 The US is now world's leading producer & exporter of crude oil & refined products. We have enough iron ore to produce steel for the next century; ditto bauxite, copper & other strategic metals. We grow enough food to feed almost 1/2 the world, who needs us more than we need them.

2532 2018-06-14 18:40:49 Russia dont need oil from anyone they on top
2533 2018-06-14 18:40:43 This reminds me of the time the costumier for LXG bought "a little oil can" to be part of Connery's costume. It sat on his make-up table for days before someone realised it was in fact a live grenade.
2534 2018-06-14 18:40:15 I don't doubt there are no American plans for alternative energy.

But in Syria, there are deals between SDF and SAA to share the oil, plus most refineries have been destroyed and don't work currently.

2539 2018-06-14 18:39:50 OK, I agree. I just think that to use a specific racial stereotype to criticize them is unnecessary. Why not call them con artists? Snake Oil salesmen? going to someone's race as a way to discredit or criticize them seems cheap and degrading.
2540 2018-06-14 18:39:47 Interesting that oil has barely moved even though the euro is getting crushed.  I have noticed a correlation between the euro and oil but only when the euro goes up. lol #oott
2541 2018-06-14 18:39:45 This is why Canada should cut up the Paris agreement , why care about places like Italy that will be swallowed by the sea . Eu doesn’t ratify ceta , no problem , we pump oil till Italy is gone

2546 2018-06-14 18:38:48 It’s always better to be preventative about the things that could go wrong. That’s one more reason why you should have your car’s oil and filters changed regularly, beyond the obvious. It’s a chance for someone to see problems that may be coming and let you address them.
2547 2018-06-14 18:38:47 Got some oil for your body..

2551 2018-06-14 18:38:00 The oil prices for Russia are gonna triple
2552 2018-06-14 18:37:57 And by *more*, you mean *any*, because "ethically-produced Canadian oil" is a slogan, not an actual thing. #themoreyouknow #themoreyoulie
2553 2018-06-14 18:37:43 apparantly not because we are everywhere there is oil.  that also tells you there is no plan to go to alternative energy.
2554 2018-06-14 18:37:38 @calgarystampede this is so wrong in many ways. Remember the Oil Companies that support you and your tarp auctions. You let this happen then it's PETA next year bitching about the rodeo.
2555 2018-06-14 18:37:33 Remember that's Jackie Chan movies where the bad guys made a oil eating bacteria. #thespynextdoor  kudos
2556 2018-06-14 18:37:29 No worries, coconut oil packed in checked bags doesn't have to be in its original container. You may pack it in the container of your choice. Have a good trip!
2557 2018-06-14 18:37:25 It’s either the decrease in oil prices or face humiliation
2558 2018-06-14 18:37:21 given the dollar move I am surprised how bid gold is    -- oil also even after Saudi and Russian talk

2562 2018-06-14 18:36:26 America's fatal flaw is the idea that our wealthiest citizens are the ones most worthy of being heard. I think. We seem to have a few fatal flaws. But yeah I'm so sick of reading about space tourism w people camped on sidewalks and startups market snake oil to terminal patients.
2563 2018-06-14 18:36:26 True, headline inflation WAS controlled (or greatly influenced) by oil.

But, will that be the case in the future?

None of us know the exact timing, but oil may become less of a factor over time.

The Saudi’s are hedging their bets by selling Aramco to the public.
2564 2018-06-14 18:36:26 Whoever is tasked with the lie detector for William ruto should have three things on stand by- a priest, Anointing oil, and Matofari ready just in case RISWA tries to enter the priest.

2571 2018-06-14 18:36:00 @Sephora the Kopari coconut oil from the weekly wow seems to have disappeared from the website. will it be coming back?
2572 2018-06-14 18:35:53 The point is banning fracking would solve 1 problem & cause 9 more larger problems namely people would get laid off & the oil is used to bring food to market. So they would come home unemployed to empty pantries
2573 2018-06-14 18:35:49 Of that, there is no doubt. 

But come June 22, shall the benefits be more in their favor, or of we net oil importers?

2588 2018-06-14 18:33:57 i just read that the clean and clear oil blotting sheets have MINERAL OIL in them.. which can cause more oil production and breakouts in oily skin.. it’s like they rely on you to not read the label!!! be careful and always read/look up ingredients!

2590 2018-06-14 18:33:46 When you have your oil changed, your miles are kept in a data base for the insurance carriers to see. The more miles you drive, the higher their exposure, and the higher your rates. I great reason to change your own oil.

2595 2018-06-14 18:33:22 Linda, actually, you’re wrong.  We actually hoarded our oil reserves for about 50 years while we consumed foreign so we wouldn’t be reliant.

2661 2018-06-14 18:26:20 Seems like someone is jelous of their "oil money". I smell BULL .....

2664 2018-06-14 18:25:59 Looks like I must have something someone wants and or these Oil people are mad.  
Either way they won't be putting there filthy Oil Rigs alongside this beautiful waterside. Looking for someone to blame.
Corruption
2665 2018-06-14 18:25:58 @ShannonSharpe is to logic like oil is to water. This dude has lost his marbles when comparing LeBron to Jordan talking about playoffs in early seasons. LeBron didn’t even make it to the playoffs for 2 yrs str8. Then Chicago’s losses in 1st round was Bucks-RY & the Cs for 2.

2670 2018-06-14 18:25:31 I just wonder why it takes Buhari regime for people to start finding bad road in there statee, so where were the same people for the past 18 years of democracy when oil prices is above $100 not mention 30 year military
2671 2018-06-14 18:25:22 Dude it’s a legit theory. I don’t get crap if I open one but if I open a ton I strike oil

2676 2018-06-14 18:24:57 My 15 year old brother baking a cake: “avacado oil makes everything better, I love it so much. I know, I’m a white bitch”
2677 2018-06-14 18:24:51 After this meltdown I took a nice bath with tea tree oil and had a glass of wine and watched the office. I felt better. My body just needed to freak out
2678 2018-06-14 18:24:46 You guys are so smart. How come Oil didn't get them OP players?How could this have happend? Bruh Netherlands didn't qualify this WC,cup Saudi Arabia did,see what I mean? Oh L,you don't cause you are DUMB. "Let's go bully Saudi Arabia for being a bad team,even after they have oil"
2679 2018-06-14 18:24:32 Lack of knowledge... Russia is one of the largest exporter of oil
2680 2018-06-14 18:24:32 Yeah a new order for sure, where China is on top. Xi is trying to make China mainstream and he could succeed, all that's left is for China to become larger buyer of Canadian oil then America will be stuffed.

2682 2018-06-14 18:24:20 OPEC meeting coming up next week! Russia and Saudi to share a juicy oil production boost! Deal was discussed at the match.
2683 2018-06-14 18:24:19 I Deadass feel like I’ve been sick for all of 2018 so far so I’m doing this thing where I take any sort of health remedy at once in hopes it’ll cure me. 
I took 4 drops of diluted Oregano oil..

Don’t ever do it it’s gross and it burns
2684 2018-06-14 18:23:56 ... you’re welcome... that’s not to say i support the notion of posthumanism... I’m probably going to be the faction heading for the hills and fighting SkyNet with rocks and fire.

2712 2018-06-14 18:19:54 for sure. but the quote is basically saying - it'll happne - shrug - we gotta build it and "stand up." I would not risk lives for an oil pipeline.
2713 2018-06-14 18:19:26 How do you know that they tried different mixes? The most I can find is that it was 'full spectrum' cannabis oil, which is typically not controlled in terms of ratios. So sounds like you are just making things up now... nice work!
2714 2018-06-14 18:19:20 I should be able to, you just gotta hit autozone and buy whatever kinda oil you wanna use
2715 2018-06-14 18:19:19 Just had an amazing booty rub-down with baby oil, and the client gave me to bottle to keep...I foresee some very fun clips coming up...
2716 2018-06-14 18:19:19  I’ll be seeing oil monitoring again next week Alix; can’t wait!
2717 2018-06-14 18:19:19 As someone who works in oil and gas it’s wild what we, as consumers, are allowed to get away with at a gas station.
2718 2018-06-14 18:19:18 @flakebarmer regarding your article on Poison Ivy, you should tell people who have encountered it to wash with soap and water with COLD water.  Warm water opens the pores and allows the oil to penetrate.
2719 2018-06-14 18:19:11 i’m eating himalayan salt, avocado oil, kettle-cooked chips and i can feel my stomach getting gentrified
2720 2018-06-14 18:19:05 I burn myself every time I cook with oil on the stove. Every. Time.
2721 2018-06-14 18:19:04 I dont care. I'm not giving up extra virgin olive oil,olives or balsamic vinegar or anyother stuff from Italy. I live in england. I need all the sunshine i can get. lol. Eating it is my only option.

2732 2018-06-14 18:18:25 Most of their moisturizers contain silicones, so I don’t have one to recommend! My dry skin loves their Moisture Renewal Oil Booster, though — it’s one of my top three serums ever :)
2733 2018-06-14 18:18:23 Thanks for sharing!
2734 2018-06-14 18:18:15 NEVER go to Walmart for an oil change, they will take 3 hours 
2735 2018-06-14 18:18:13 The nice man who changed my oil certainly didn’t ask but I did let him know that my car problems are coinciding with my emotional problems in terms of intensity and frequency

2746 2018-06-14 18:17:27 While dissecting the oil data, seen this #AcheDin data point:

ONGC profit in 2013-14 was ₹22095 crores reduced to ₹17900 crores in 2016-17, yep, 23% decrease!

While Reliance profit grown from ₹22493 crores in 2013-14 increased to ₹31425 crores in 2016-17, ie, 40% increase!!
2747 2018-06-14 18:17:23 In the end, Oil is the real winner! #RUSKSA
2748 2018-06-14 18:17:22 Or do you love the Republican party that lied to invade Iraq, then crashed the economy so that over one million were displaced from their homes.  And what the hell, let's throw in the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster resulting from DEREGULATION. That party? Those ideas UR nasty.

2753 2018-06-14 18:16:54 BP & the CIA fucked up the Middle East to get the oil. Cecil Rhodes fucked up South Africa to get the diamonds. The English conquered India to sell opium to China. Since the dawn of man. White people with guns have been fucking people of all colors to exploit their resources.
2754 2018-06-14 18:16:48 All that oil money & the wife beaters still couldn't win.

2756 2018-06-14 18:16:47 Seriously though, I met with colleagues designing a board this week and the desire to include every single eventuality was hard to overcome.  Keeping it simple can be suprisingly hard to do at times.  Your son nailed it.  (No oil monitoring tho ).
2757 2018-06-14 18:16:46 What brand of tea tree oil do you use?
2758 2018-06-14 18:16:35 How about switching away from oil to renewable energy for homes and cars?
2759 2018-06-14 18:16:34 What is the capacity of this oil pan
2760 2018-06-14 18:16:31 And yet every country that has tried to run on pure socialism or communism like this has literally fallen into this same rut/cycle.

Also, where are you getting these numbers from? "More private industry"?

Whuuuuut? Bro. 50% of their GDP was oil. It was owned by PDVSA...
2761 2018-06-14 18:16:13 I don’t want them to tell me anything else that’s wrong with my car! Change my oil and let me go about my business
2762 2018-06-14 18:16:04 In my mind, watching@PutinRF_Eng and Saudi Crown Prince shaking hands after  #Russia's first goal was like

2770 2018-06-14 18:15:28 Ekuru is beautiful. It's made like moin-moin but neat, just blended beans, no oil/seasonings, so it comes out white and crumbly. Then a delicious ata-dindin on the side. It's no longer common, I doubt it ever was. In need of a revival.
2771 2018-06-14 18:15:22 Russia is oil rich nation.

2791 2018-06-14 18:13:16 I am so sick of the National Post, Trudeau is standing up for Canada regarding trade and is determined to make sure a pipe line gets built so that Canadian oil gets exported to foreign markets despite all the obstacles.

2794 2018-06-14 18:13:03 So you want gov to not issues licenses to practice medicine, regulate drugs, require payments in dollars, regulate hospitals, require ERs to take people in, run Medicaid and Medicare. 

You want to return to snake oil and charlatans on behalf of the myth of the free market.
2795 2018-06-14 18:13:01 FACT: The MEPs’ proposed ban on palm oil in 2021 has been removed from the RED text. There is no ban. There is no explicit action against palm oil. Why are Green MEPs’ claiming victory, when all their demands were rejected?

2803 2018-06-14 18:12:03 #Palmoilchallenge I called  @purefreefrom who confirmed their palm oil is from a sustainable source. Their packaging should mention this.

2807 2018-06-14 18:11:41 Also, judgment of myself even, has caused Iran to shut down all of their silk worm trade. The USA supplies large amounts of our own oil. How must they survive in the desert? They require not only food, but clothing too as their silks are gone ... Renelle
2808 2018-06-14 18:11:34 Tanning oil is a daily necessity during the summer idc idc
2809 2018-06-14 18:11:33 The main problem with oilsands output is that there should not be an output and expanding the world's filthiest source of fossil fuel is a step in the wrong direction. Toxic dilbit is not oil and does not belong on a super tanker.
2810 2018-06-14 18:11:26 Yall just when I was looking for a dupe for the rms concealer bc i dont wanna pay 34 bucks for a tiny jar of pigmented coconut oil, Glossier decided to ship to sweden whehehe
2811 2018-06-14 18:11:20 If motivation not political, then what? 
Any action from taking a crap to getting out of bed is motivated by something.
2812 2018-06-14 18:11:11 Hi Vikki,
It’s a longer discussion, but.. the environment is being damaged by all this too:
German countryside is covered in 28,000 wind turbines; Indonesian rainforests are being felled for palm oil for bio diesel resulting in the near extinction of white rhino etc

2813 2018-06-14 18:11:07 Wait until your trade war with Canada gets into high gear and the Alberta Oil stops heading your way. Gas prices will not go down anytime soon. Maybe Mr Kim can help.p

2818 2018-06-14 18:10:51 oil burns lithium as proven can be recycled near on 100%. New battery chemistry has lithium only 1% of a cells make up. Lithium tech is solid reliable just now but we will be on pure glass solid state batteries by 2025. Dyson is leading the way in this just now.

2821 2018-06-14 18:10:31 #PutinAtFIFAWC displayed such honest and humble expressions, every time Russian team scored goal. Probably shaming Saudis that so much oil rich money, and yet such disastrous team they can source. #WorldCup #RUSKSA
2822 2018-06-14 18:10:28 Russia has enough crude oil tho lol

2824 2018-06-14 18:10:22 American civilians aren't impoverished pashtun. We have arms, ammo, propane, fuel. The salt of the earth types that would be ardently against the State all run the farms, oil refineries, manufactories. They're more socially integrated than blue state/blue city folk.
2825 2018-06-14 18:10:22 Previously, bitcoin and ETH may have been offered as securities (like shares of a company), which would have required registration with the SEC, but a consensus has emerged that they behave and are treated like commodities, similar to gold and oil.

2836 2018-06-14 18:09:14 As an astute student of history.  All backroom machinations still have a violent/murderous conclusion.  

Lets use oil in iraq for example.  The closed door moves were to gain acceptance for the violent overthrow to come.
2837 2018-06-14 18:09:04 lol I thought I bought hair oil yesterday and put a shit ton in my hair this morning before class per usual. So my hair finally dries and it’s hella oily. I get back to my house and read the bottle (it’s in french) and nowhere do I see the word hair... y’all I bought body oil
2838 2018-06-14 18:09:04 the fact that the US embargoed them right as oil prices plummeted might have more to do with it
2839 2018-06-14 18:09:02 I was at a gas station putting oil in my car and a guy came over to help me. Just glad there is still decent people in the world!

2844 2018-06-14 18:08:24 Don’t you dare try and tell me what to do you poisonous, odious little snake oil merchant. Tell the Rolls Royce workers of Derby to “suck it up”.
2845 2018-06-14 18:08:20 Practice what you preach. Owning stock in companies that use foreign direct investment, labor, & holdings = not putting "america first". Protecting oil interests overseas = not putting america first, not helping young, elderly and sick in this country =not putting america first

2848 2018-06-14 18:07:54 US car companies need to learn they are in the business of selling cars.
Not oil.
When will they accept that the ICE is dead.

2851 2018-06-14 18:07:46 Venezuela may have the largest oil reserves but it's not a developed country. The Newsweek article is based on a study comparing healthcare amongst 11 developed countries ranked some of the wealthiest in the world. Venezuela is ranked in the 80s.
2852 2018-06-14 18:07:39 Yes Ed this is what I think! One reason he didn’t make taxes public. He might be rich, but he owes much more. And owes it to a foreign entity. Although the money laundering business is just the kind of thing that’d appeal to orange snake oil salesman!
2853 2018-06-14 18:06:46 Uh huh investigate... Kinda like the investigations on oil companies fixing gas prices?   Uh huh. Oookay

2858 2018-06-14 18:05:47 And they were all surprised! Some things are as plain as the nose on your face and Trump is a through and through snake oil selling con man. Why some cannot see this is truly a great and utter mystery.
2859 2018-06-14 18:05:31 I just got my tanker loaded with oil here in Port Allen, La. Once I get my paperwork. It goes to Glen Dale west Virginia by 11pm Saturday

2865 2018-06-14 18:04:56 Clowns like him (along with Madani, Blas, etc) propped up that whole "MBS is taking power.....the while oil world will change!" horse shit back in late October/November.

Handful of blueberries 
1 scoop coconut oil
1 scoop peanut butter 
1 scoop vanilla protein 
1 cup Almond milk

The flavor profile is perfect on this one. It truly tastes like a milkshake.

2998 2018-06-14 17:51:45 When it comes to selling snake oil to dumbed-down masses, I totally  agree.
2999 2018-06-14 17:51:35 @EHPinfo - living near oil and gas facilities can put families at heightened risks for health problems. Limiting pollution can address these public health hazards. Current #natgas sites must be regulated.
3000 2018-06-14 17:51:29 trump promised you so much winning. He wouldn't touch Social Security or Medicare, how's that working? How's your tax refund going?

3007 2018-06-14 17:50:53  well most dilute before adding to scalp. 1 part black seed oil with 2 parts olive oil that doesnt explain the smell though
3008 2018-06-14 17:50:49 Someone said 
The only thing that can make Saudi Arabia score goals will be when you put like 4barrels of oil behind the goalpost.
3009 2018-06-14 17:50:47 How right :)
3010 2018-06-14 17:50:39 You mean you are at it.  You own lots of stock in big oil.  Plus you asked for a gas hike.

3031 2018-06-14 17:48:30 I don't know. The only truffle oil I have had (whatever it was) was truffle mayo with sweet potato fries. I really liked it. I don't know if it was real or not but I would eat it again.
3032 2018-06-14 17:48:28 
3033 2018-06-14 17:48:25 Germany will win unless Putin told them no more oil...

3059 2018-06-14 17:45:57 There are two oils that are produced from olives. The oil from the fruit (what we know as 'olive') and the oil from the seed inside the kernel of the olive. Break a kernel and you'll find a softer seed inside.

3077 2018-06-14 17:43:50 That part was interesting to me. Since you added the masala right after the oil was heated - I suppose all of this is a low-to-medium flame since its in the pan for 10-15 mins?

3085 2018-06-14 17:43:16 I’ve been googling the laws & I think only cbd oil is legal right now in NC so even with a card smoking weed wouldn’t have saved her.

3090 2018-06-14 17:42:45 As soon as you mention oil you lose all credibility. Have you worked in that industry? You know the tax returns or lack of them in the last few years? You know the declining numbers of workers? If you think there’s potential to balance the books with oil you’re sadly mistaken
3091 2018-06-14 17:42:41 Much better.the Saudi's played as if they had drunk their oil and were constipated.
3092 2018-06-14 17:42:34 #WorldCup2018 at least we still rich money & oil 
3093 2018-06-14 17:42:30 If it's good zaatar (properly roasted, Jordanian or Palestinian don't yell at me Lebs), best eaten with labneh and olive oil drizzled on top, and pita bread. Also good on avocado toast. And good with garlic + sumac + olive oil for marinade to grill chicken thighs with.
3094 2018-06-14 17:42:21 Stalin is smiling! Even Putin's reaction after goals said it all.

3106 2018-06-14 17:40:41 True Mr. Shatner. They also forget that the plastic in said device is made from oil, not to mention their plastic Star Trek figurines. As well as their oversimplification of the problems, technical & socioeconomic involved in completely changing from fossil fuel dependency.

3118 2018-06-14 17:39:28 I have one of those salt & oil scrubs which works great on my body and thought one time in the shower "I should try this on my face" and, people, don't do that, it is like drowning in the ocean
3119 2018-06-14 17:39:20 Now we know that gold can dissolve in water, oil and water can b mixed. My whole life..anything else to add to the list?

3133 2018-06-14 17:37:37 Very simple ,shallots garlic little celery softened in olive oil then add red mullet fillets ( boned and chopped up ,scruffy small fish are ideal ) . Then lots of parsley bit lemon jest and juice and chopped cherry toms for colour . Add cooked pasta and a bit cooking water season

3135 2018-06-14 17:37:27 No it doesn’t, NI receive most Barnett. Our govt is in Holyrood they manage very well given the shortfall we get from our own cash. Your’s is useless. Scotland’s oil revenues have kept the UK from going bankrupt for decades. You need to educate yourself ignorance is no excuse.
3136 2018-06-14 17:37:26 A brilliant spice. Scatter on flatbread w/ olive oil, or sprinkle on pizza, or brush halved eggplant w/ olive oil and sprinkle w/ zatar and salt before roasting.

3149 2018-06-14 17:36:23 Phasing out oil without a viable replacement is suicide.  Something new or sitting in the patent office needs to become mainstream before that's possible.

3151 2018-06-14 17:36:13 Kalo kamu pakai face oil sama moist udah bisa ngatasin masalah2 kulitmu, mending gak usah pakai yang lain lagi. Soalnya kalau terlalu berlebihan itu gak baik, banyak yang kulitnya baik-baik aja karena pake skincare berlebihan malah muncul masalah. Tapi itu pilihanmu sih.

Also,remember last year when they discovered that Trump had taken money from one of his "foundations" to buy a $10,000.00 oil painting of HIMSELF for one of his Trump Clubs?~So,Trump likes to use his Charity Foundation moneys for HIMSELF & his greedy family!

3197 2018-06-14 17:32:18 Saudi Arabia can like to stick to Sharia study and oil blocks.

They should scrap football.
3198 2018-06-14 17:32:17 Best way to keep oil in ground is an honest accounting of market value on reclamation together w/ an honest booking of reserves only burnable under 1.5-2° scenarios.

Insolvent Co's can hand over their keys & the public can manage remaining production to fund cleanup/transition.
3199 2018-06-14 17:32:15 Russia is a net exporter of oil, so it would be great for them.
3200 2018-06-14 17:32:10 Yes the Saudis better go back to what they are good at ripping off rest of the world in oil prices 
3201 2018-06-14 17:32:06 No more oil for Putin 
3202 2018-06-14 17:31:59 And of course that US oil companies have huge financial interests in north sea oil - not necessarily secure in an independent Scotland.

3224 2018-06-14 17:30:31 no those would be solar *panels* not solar energy, binnion. I could also show you a field littered with oil refinery products, but I am already the correct one here. Oil is filthy energy, you are filthy for defending it. Not rocket science.

3240 2018-06-14 17:29:17 Agreed though as the match moved along today, the goals were starting to flow far too easily for Russia...

3242 2018-06-14 17:29:11 Pay attention to symbolic gestures vs. real pressure as a negotiating tactic. Stopping war games or even replacing the armistice with a peace treaty are symbolic. Strangling NK's oil supply is real pressure and Trump will not easy up until NK is defanged.
3243 2018-06-14 17:29:02 Jis din oil khatm ho jayega aur world solar energy par dependent hoga...tab Saudi Arabia ka tamasha hum bhi dekhenge..
3244 2018-06-14 17:28:23 #Iraq has been sending more crude to the US since the so-called cuts began. This week wasnt a sharp increase aside from the previous week; many weeks (especially in 2017) saw significantly higher Iraqi #OIL imports. Nothing bearish or alarming about it.
3245 2018-06-14 17:28:21 Play tomorrow for sure. Thank you for your informations!

3250 2018-06-14 17:27:58 The Saudis should be embarrassed - a very weak Russian squad just throttled them back to the oil fields. No one should lose that bad in a #WorldCup
3251 2018-06-14 17:27:54 Saudi should just stick to drilling oil and playing cricket #WorldCup

3260 2018-06-14 17:27:03 Burning the midnight oil last night has resulted in tiredness hitting me like a brick wall tonight. Was planning to go shopping after dinner but that won't be happening now! How is everyone else today?
3261 2018-06-14 17:27:01 So Russia wins and gets to control the world's oil supply LMAO #Elgassico
3262 2018-06-14 17:26:52 It's a bit difficult to swallow "we don't pick winners or losers" when they are obviously picking oil and coal to win

3280 2018-06-14 17:25:31 So there I was at 17:50, darkness coming & admiring my soup, when poof! Lights out. Nary a warning!

3285 2018-06-14 17:25:15 Lmao I’m getting my oil changed at Kwik car and I forgot that they clean your car and I just feel bad for them.
3286 2018-06-14 17:25:14 @3stepsahead I do, it’s obvious to anyone with experience. Just see what the stock is doing with oil moving higher.
3287 2018-06-14 17:25:10 500 days into this American tragedy called Trump, 87% of Republicans still support him. That should shock the shit out of Democrats. That means Republican fully intend to re-elect this lying, incompetent traitor. This snake oil salesman has these people totally hypnotized.

3321 2018-06-14 17:23:06 They will concede against Egypt and will definitely need a goal to get a result. Golovin has a yellow too, he will have to play cautious.
3322 2018-06-14 17:23:03 I don't exactly have a skin routine but I do break out often (not exactly enough to be considered acne). I avoid it by treating the breakouts with organic teetree(?) oil. especially because you said you have oily skin, it should help. i also say drink lots of water ^^

3335 2018-06-14 17:21:55 Russia is fool for dominating Saudi Arabia, now the Saudí’s are gonna cut off all of the worlds oil supply and thus WW3 starts.
3336 2018-06-14 17:21:53 Dear Bernard,

Are you expecting them to file a WTO case?

Soybean oil banned too....Argentina will love it.
3337 2018-06-14 17:21:47 You might want to do a little studying yourself, especially on the oil subject. We have plenty of oil, our government, especially the last administration did not want it recovered, it was to much of a bargaining tool from other countries to be recovered here.
3338 2018-06-14 17:21:42 No they’re not, KSA is only good with oil not football
3339 2018-06-14 17:21:40 If there’s no or minimal impact on oil and gas prices then I don’t have an issue

3344 2018-06-14 17:21:13 If you consider manufactured goods only, Canada has a slight surplus. But if you include all goods and services it's a slight US surplus. It's a slim margin either way. Mostly what we sell you is oil. The price of oil fluctuates and that affects the overall number. But so what?

3363 2018-06-14 17:19:46 No it isn't, but 96% of oil and NLG production, and 63% of natural gas production is.  By any measure that is the bulk of it.

3371 2018-06-14 17:19:21 Not forgetting at all. We have interfered significantly in several middle eastern countries in our pursuit of oil, and this helped breed hatred towards the US. We have culpability there. We do not have to apologize for a regime that kills, oppresses, and starves their own people

3381 2018-06-14 17:18:51 My guess is all they'll need is a draw against Egypt. Can't see Saudi Arabia getting pumped in all three matches.
3382 2018-06-14 17:18:51 We would have lost the match cause they will bribe our players with the oil
3383 2018-06-14 17:18:50 In 2017, the Canadian Energy Research Institute estimated 500,000 barrels per day of Canada's heavy oil output would be affected by the IMO cap - either in the form of a drop in demand or a drop in price to offset the cost of additional refining.
3384 2018-06-14 17:18:50 yes, Iran is a terrorist regime, as is North Korea. how is the USA world champion in oil import?
3385 2018-06-14 17:18:48 There’s some things I don’t mind using a lot of oil for  I like it for convenience when I don’t feel like spending too much time cooking. I get a lot of my fats in other things.
3386 2018-06-14 17:18:48 News says :

3404 2018-06-14 17:17:31 I second every one of your thoughts. Brilliant, artists, inspiring women.  And like any halfway sentient parent, I still choke up on the line "as her folks drive away her dad yells 'check the oil'." Doing it now !
3405 2018-06-14 17:17:29 Unlike IAAF and African exodus to oil rich gulf states where they also have to convert
3406 2018-06-14 17:17:23 If Nigeria do mistake chop 5-0 for world cup, Nigerians will start reminding us of our Population and oil money.

3419 2018-06-14 17:16:52 idk why G&W would be chaotic neutral, his games all seem like pretty noble causes -cleaning up an oil spill, saving people from a fire, stopping people from falling into a manhole, etc.

3434 2018-06-14 17:15:47 There's little future in oil. It pollutes a f, both in possible disasters and 'regular' air and water pollution. It's still a finite resource, and it's getting harder to reach thus more expensive.
3435 2018-06-14 17:15:40 Pulled my back somehow yesterday... had a rough night! Can’t do a chiropractor cause I have two new hips... Light a candle for the old man, please, lol...  prolly down a few days! CBD oil, Aleve, ice. Suggestions welcome!

Ah!!
3451 2018-06-14 17:14:46 Don't worry unless it's USA vs Saudi Arabia, the russians have enough oil to last a while.
3452 2018-06-14 17:14:46 Bathi it was an "oil classico" 
3453 2018-06-14 17:14:44 You have to be kidding Gareth?

Looking for oil for example, costs money. Significant amounts

Companies who look for oil therefore put a lot of effort into making sure we all buy oil products. Exploration leads to lobbying, advertising, inducements etc

It makes a big difference
3454 2018-06-14 17:14:44 But what about the oil industry? Killing the left coast and the east coast. I can't wait to get these guys out of here. Not to mention the borders. Now the PC party is pissing me off being fractured, we need a strong conservative unified government to stop huggy boy
3455 2018-06-14 17:14:42 Thank you, Congressman, and please keep fighting to save the Jersey shore. But your party loves states rights except when they don't.  And when it comes to their rich oil company donor friends, states rights don't exist for the @GOP.

Can someone please get me the fuck out of here
3463 2018-06-14 17:14:25 Force us to use solar? I think it's great that society is pursuing renewable resources that are environmentally friendly. Only people who benefit from oil profits oppose things like solar, hydro and wind energy. And  people that easily convinced to follow those people.
3464 2018-06-14 17:14:19 Saudi Arabia just showed that you need more than oil to make it in this world.

3465 2018-06-14 17:14:16 King Salman sat on the throne, King Salman made sure he’s alone . All the oil money and all of the east , couldn’t save Saudi from the Russian beast.

3467 2018-06-14 17:14:13 I've just heard that King Salman will send these boys to work in the oil fields for embarrassing him
3468 2018-06-14 17:14:08 It appears they can actually cold press corn oil, but it's not very efficient, and thus, expensive.  The germ is where the oil is. and only 20% of the kernel by weight is germ and only 25% of the germ is oil.
3469 2018-06-14 17:14:07 Football is not the calling of Saudi Arabians, they should just concentrate on making and sleeping on more oil money abeg

3477 2018-06-14 17:13:52 The definition of unnecessary calories is my eggs sticking to the pan after adding olive oil
3478 2018-06-14 17:13:51 And this figure does not take into account the huge amount of electricity we use to produce pertol and diesel. A medium oil refinery will use the same amount of electricity in a year as Coventry and Leicester use. That would power a lot of ev miles!
3479 2018-06-14 17:13:49 eh? Russia has plenty of its own oil & natural gas.

3525 2018-06-14 17:11:07 Today my boss had me take one of the company trucks to the dealer in Worthington for an oil change. So I got to drive a huge vehicle around on a tiny, crowded lot on one of the busiest roads in the county.
3526 2018-06-14 17:11:03 It's fair to say that Russia obliterated Saudi Arabia. Now they have to supply their oil to Russia for free 
3527 2018-06-14 17:11:01 Alright Russian people, we will increase the price of oil 500% #WorldCupRussia2018
3528 2018-06-14 17:11:00 I hope Saudi Arabia won’t try to influence the increase of oil prices with an extra $0.5 per barrel due to that heavy defeat

3530 2018-06-14 17:10:58 Re: this article; it’s from 2/2017. Note no impeachment. This is a complicated issue, & experts disagree on the implications. But Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe had plantations that sold overseas. The Bush family was in oil. Hoover had international mining interests..

3535 2018-06-14 17:10:46 The oil derby  .
3536 2018-06-14 17:10:42 I can predict that with this Saudi lose, Oil prices will go up 5 times

3556 2018-06-14 17:09:55 By donating oil
3557 2018-06-14 17:09:54 So our government is willing to fight the US on something that accounts for less than 1% of our GDP. On the other hand this same government obstructs the Oil and gas sector worth 12.9% of GDP. New regs, carbon tax etc. Makes sense doesn’t it.
3558 2018-06-14 17:09:50 Oil prices certainly going up tomorrow . Saudi Arabia loses
3559 2018-06-14 17:09:49 Guess what..oil price will increase by 2moro.
3560 2018-06-14 17:09:49 If you want a disgusting greasy layer floating on top of your Jim Beam, you're better off just adding a dose of cooking oil to help push these shitty ideas out.
3561 2018-06-14 17:09:45 Texas has Most Oil Energy & Wind Energy & soon to the most Solar Energy.
3562 2018-06-14 17:09:42 2. Russia is trying hard to align itself with Iran for the power and the oil wealth. The wealth is what Russia needs most to return to power. And they were getting it from Iran UNTIL Trump knowingly cut off their cash cow w/ Iran with worse Sanctions than we placed on NOKO.
3563 2018-06-14 17:09:41 Enjoy the rigged first match against your oil and weapons trading friend, Russia. The next ones won't be so easy!

3640 2018-06-14 17:05:32 ordered my wedding dress a size smaller #motivation & it fit perfectly - even a little big from the waist. This morning I really wanted chilaquiles.... there was no oil or tortillas.... that’s the universe saying no lol  protein shake it is. 
3641 2018-06-14 17:05:31 Russia went so deep into Saudi Arabia that they found oil
#WorldCup #RUSvKSA
3642 2018-06-14 17:05:31 Actually, Russia is one of the worlds leading oil producers. If I’m not mistaking they’re ahead of Saudi Arabia.
3643 2018-06-14 17:05:25 bredda Saudi Arabia and Russia is currently making oil deals I wonder how influential was that deal to football cause.... nah bro big big start a world cup yah tek 5 ?
3644 2018-06-14 17:05:22 MBS can afford two zero in Moscow

Mix it all together 
Put it in a 8 x 8 pan

3648 2018-06-14 17:05:16 Oil stains on white clothing is the worst
3649 2018-06-14 17:05:14 And in August it was warranted. Just think the whole ‘Pep/City wanted Sanchez so you must accept he’s brilliant’ thing is whack. Only reason his fee was ever 40m+ was Arsenal trying to keep him and Wengz said he doesn’t want oil money
3650 2018-06-14 17:05:11 The price of the oil will rise up from tomorrow.

3659 2018-06-14 17:04:44 @POTUS  you say this is the greatest economy, interest rates up, health insurance through the roof, labor participation 62 pct, Oil and gas up double digits, tax cuts for the rich didn't work out. disposable income down. Not a great economy. If you believe RT
3660 2018-06-14 17:04:42 It's a fair argument to make but one I'd be far more comfortable with if he wasn't given that mess of a roster to work with. With that said, he certainly made his share of missteps along the way.

3674 2018-06-14 17:04:01 It's always awful when people lose their jobs luckily Ford is Premier. In Alberta 200k have been laid of directly or indirectly in Oil and Gas. Notley has done zero & Canadians have rejected En East & N Gateway while Kinder is on life support. 
Unlike Albertans they have a chance
3675 2018-06-14 17:04:00 5 missiles to the oil tankers
3676 2018-06-14 17:04:00 Oil prices to soar after the shambles
3677 2018-06-14 17:03:58 Saudi Arabia is not a footballing country, all there is oil and oil, #WorldCup
3678 2018-06-14 17:03:56 Probably oil
3679 2018-06-14 17:03:55 They were doing an oil deal, nothing about this has to deal with the #WorldCup
3680 2018-06-14 17:03:55 @SaudiArabia do the world a favour and double down on that oil production to atone for the garbage you put on display.
3681 2018-06-14 17:03:52 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
3682 2018-06-14 17:03:51 Saudi arabia should just stick to oil harrasing man handling toturing and human trafficking
3683 2018-06-14 17:03:50 My oil pen is full of sand but I could not be around those people sober 
3684 2018-06-14 17:03:47 You wonna get on the Oil of Olay!
3685 2018-06-14 17:03:44 @GreenpeaceID @ForestHeroes replace soy & rapeseed oils with palm oil and you will have 116 mioHa land to reforest !
3686 2018-06-14 17:03:40 One thing is confirmed after this game, Vodka is better than Oil.
3687 2018-06-14 17:03:35 Dhamaal 2 ka scene yaad gaya! Oil oil oillll
3688 2018-06-14 17:03:35 lol nope, Im not giving my 2L cooking oil. I didnt even use it yet. Ouf!
3689 2018-06-14 17:03:35 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.

Make a tinfoil bowl & smoke pinenuts brushed with olive oil. Rest nuts & mix with goat cheese. Stuff the mini peppers and drizzle balsamic reduc. Season to taste.

3697 2018-06-14 17:03:13 They gotta hand over their oil lmao
3698 2018-06-14 17:03:11 Oil price back to $50 a barrel soon 
3699 2018-06-14 17:03:09 Per the sticker, my oil should’ve been changed 7 months and 2000 miles ago... the car itself says I’m doing just fine. “Every 3 months my ass.”
3700 2018-06-14 17:03:09 Especially once they start offering free barrels of oil!
3701 2018-06-14 17:03:06 diego, nervous: oil is made of what now
3702 2018-06-14 17:03:05 #RUSKSA Saudis it seems you can't really buy out goals through all the oil money.

3704 2018-06-14 17:03:04 Whoops! I’m pleased by how quickly you responded - you were right. The drain plug washer was included in the same baggie as the oil filter housing o-ring! Thank you for your service!

3706 2018-06-14 17:03:04 Today Russia beats Saudi Arabia 5-0.  Tomorrow Russia annex’s Saudi Arabi and gets the rest of the oil.
3707 2018-06-14 17:03:03 We can safely assume the oil prices are going to skyrocket now. #Worldcup2018Russia

3709 2018-06-14 17:02:54 Russia feeling like...'menh! we hosting to win this trophy' massive win! (but wait til the next match) Saudi shud just stick to selling their oil... #WorldCup
3710 2018-06-14 17:02:53 Russia just drained oil from Saudi Arabia. That left kick goal.  5 #WorldCup #WorldCupRussia2018
3711 2018-06-14 17:02:53 On the other hand, too much oil in the game makes the Saudi Arabians slips so easy.

3716 2018-06-14 17:02:38 DT was/is a very accomplished world class liar. Part of being a great snake oil salesman is having no shame.
3717 2018-06-14 17:02:36 There's no soccer in @SaudiArabia but just an oil #SSFootball #WorldCupRussia2018
3718 2018-06-14 17:02:36 How did the Saudi keeper not save that free kick at the end? He was right there. Either he's that bad, or he's in a new favourable oil deal... #WorldCup
3719 2018-06-14 17:02:35 #OPEC does not even price the #oil.  #OPEC only controls the supply from its member countries. #Crude is priced on the wall streets of the world.  The minister should know that.
3720 2018-06-14 17:02:34 Saudi Arabia  should just stick to providing us with oil #WorldCup 
3721 2018-06-14 17:02:34 NO ADV BAFANA BAFANA SHOULD HAVE REPLACED SAUDI ARABIA........they are all about oil and gold cars not football
3722 2018-06-14 17:02:32 Absolute scenes on my timeline!

Matters have escalated from World Cup football to politics, ISIS, Oil reserves, terrorism & bashing gay people.

People from USA getting involved when they didn't even qualify!
3723 2018-06-14 17:02:31 Russia the northern teddy bear: infinite scores of goal! - united of the many oil wells: flour mesh stainless sifter! 
3724 2018-06-14 17:02:28 Natural gas 5- 0 Oil hahahah
3725 2018-06-14 17:02:28 Russia had the worst lineup in over 20 years, yet they destroyed Saudi.  5-0 . I guess oil money can’t buy talents #WorldCupRussia2018

3736 2018-06-14 17:01:52 I think it's high time that people recognize that McLellan isn't a good coach. Anybody that buys the assistants being replaced is hopelessly naive IMO.
3737 2018-06-14 17:01:48 Are you saying American oil is not ethically produced?
3738 2018-06-14 17:01:47 Russia 5 - Saudi 0, oil price will go up now 
3739 2018-06-14 17:01:47 Saudi Arabia just lost all its Oil to Russia 
3740 2018-06-14 17:01:44 Fasting cost them the match..
hopefully they get better by the 2nd game but then Saudi oil money shd pump some muscles into those boys
3741 2018-06-14 17:01:43 if u think abt it its pretty amazing that i just managed to drop this..... form thingy full of oil, lose my meal, dirty the entire kitchen, burn AND cut myself all within the same minute
this hurts
3742 2018-06-14 17:01:42 Never seen so many oil tycoons on a field before
3743 2018-06-14 17:01:40 Nuclear bomb 1 Oil 0
3744 2018-06-14 17:01:34 if it is to use oil money to buy twitter polls Saudi Arabia will be Number 1 but when it's time to play match they collect 5-0 #RUSKSA
3745 2018-06-14 17:01:30 5-0......that 2 oil deals and 3 arms deals in the bag ;)
3746 2018-06-14 17:01:20 Rigged!  That oil deal mentioned at the starts looking more likely now.
3747 2018-06-14 17:01:18 You must be ballzy to beat Saudi Arabia 5-0 because Saudi Arabians are unpredictable people, next thing you'll know they've closed oil pipelines to Russia. Joke is on the Russians

3764 2018-06-14 17:00:53 Would show the truth about his finances, and possibly be enough to prevent his re-election, if not cause his ousting. Then, a REAL president could fix our ridiculous deficit and re-stabilize oil markets so that gas prices will go down, among many other things.
3765 2018-06-14 17:00:51 Saudi Arabia are just a waste of a world cup slot...should just concentrate on selling oil and camels
3766 2018-06-14 17:00:50 Group A is deadly oo what 
Right now UAE knows they have no chance of qualifying oo  so they should go and concentrate on oil .

3771 2018-06-14 17:00:41 SAUDI ARABIA JUST KNOW HOW TO PRICE OIL #WorldCup

3780 2018-06-14 17:00:24 I see him being a good fit with McDavid at some point but you can tell he needs to figure things out first. Once that happens, his size, shot, speed and ability to play a two-way game will be the perfect complement to 97.
3781 2018-06-14 17:00:23 Gee trillions of dollars, and that cannot buy 11 players capable of scoring...oil money is useless?
3782 2018-06-14 17:00:22 I hate when I’m frying shit and I keep getting popped from the oil

3784 2018-06-14 17:00:17 Conspiracy theory: Rusia agreed with Saudi Arabia to maintain oil production stable in exchange for a 5-0 win in the opening game of #WorldCup2018
3785 2018-06-14 17:00:15 We should expect nothing less from people who's mantras have included " drill here , drill now " and " drill baby drill "  , take vast amounts of cash from the oil and gas industry , and protect the oil and gas indusrires corporate welfare programs aka subsidies . 
(1)
3786 2018-06-14 17:00:13 That performance had 'backroom deal' written all over it. Saudi keeper didn't even bother with the last goal there. 

Russia will probably announce a huge oil deal with the Saudis next week.
3787 2018-06-14 17:00:13 Saudi Arabia is a Harambe Stars with oil money. Frauds
3788 2018-06-14 17:00:12 This game probably the fastest Saudi Arabia went down since they discovered oil there

3794 2018-06-14 17:00:06 Even England could beat the Saudi’s, then again we have too many oil interests unlike the Russians.
3795 2018-06-14 17:00:05 In 101 Marketing, this is called "The bandwagon" approach.  Don't be fooled by this snake oil salesman folks.  He uses every trick in the book to hook you.
3796 2018-06-14 17:00:04 Behind the counter you will also find an OIL LAMP.
3797 2018-06-14 17:00:02 Saudi Arabians buys a lot of things with oil money but they cannot buy a win for a football match lol.
3798 2018-06-14 17:00:00 spilled fuckn oil on my sneaks and i barely wear these
3799 2018-06-14 16:59:58 Seeing Salman hug Putin after Russia's 5-0 victory over Saudi Arabia, I can't help but wonder if this is part of some oil deal
3800 2018-06-14 16:59:55 Like unless the oil has THC in it I’m not interested 
3801 2018-06-14 16:59:53 Now that the leaders of the 2nd and 3rd biggest oil producers met at the opening match of the 2018 World Cup:

(1) What was agreed to?
(2) How will that affect the June 22 #OPEC meeting?
3802 2018-06-14 16:59:52 Saudi thought they could do great things in the world cup with their oil and their destruction in other countries. Lol behaaaaave and sit down . Uruguay will bless u with another 5 inshalla
3803 2018-06-14 16:59:51 Too much oil mate, thinking of buying a football team thereafter
3804 2018-06-14 16:59:51 Saudi Arabia is a living testimony that oil can be useless sometimes!! 
3805 2018-06-14 16:59:46 MBS is definitely sending that team to the oil wells
3806 2018-06-14 16:59:42 Oil prices going up today after that annihilation #RUSKSA #WorldCupRussia2018
3807 2018-06-14 16:59:37 after this loss oil prices will be skyrocketting five times more 
3808 2018-06-14 16:59:36 Why is the government killing the oil industry and the auto sector? I mean I hate to spout conspiracy theories but tell me why they would want to cripple an economy
3809 2018-06-14 16:59:36 Oil prices to go up tomorrow ... 
#WorldCup18 #thanksButNoThanksRussia
3810 2018-06-14 16:59:35 I've only tested with oil that's been used 3x for donut or cannoli, since the technique is meant for deep cleaning (& again, overly complicated when straining through cheesecloth is so fast & effective). I've never used less than 2 quarts, since that's what my recipes call for.
3811 2018-06-14 16:59:32 Russia made a fortune from the oil fields.

3816 2018-06-14 16:59:22 Why don't u ask the government to stop the UK from buying any more Saudi oil so they can't fund arms purchases.
3817 2018-06-14 16:59:19 Oil = money = good players
3818 2018-06-14 16:59:18 Seed oils are the worst. Best to use butter or lard. Greeks never cooked with olive oil but use it on salads.
3819 2018-06-14 16:59:12 just be self sufficient andn use texas oil
3820 2018-06-14 16:59:07 Whatch Saudi Arabia increase oil prices even more.

3827 2018-06-14 16:58:56 Wow, Saudi Arabia sucks. They're good at hoarding oil but they're just as bad at soccer as they are at showing kindness toward women.
3828 2018-06-14 16:58:56 As Russia has gas, not oil, makes no sense.
3829 2018-06-14 16:58:55 This bread with oil & herbs on the side is soooo bomb
3830 2018-06-14 16:58:55 In Soccer yes ... in oil they are rolling in gold bars...
3831 2018-06-14 16:58:54 Giving out their avalanche of oil wells would have been a better proposition for this Saudi Arabian side, than the disgraceful defeats that await them in their group. 

Such lethargy!
3832 2018-06-14 16:58:54 Good thing Saudi Arabia has oil because they're certainly lacking in the football (soccer) department! #RUSvKSA #WorldCup2018 #Mundial2018

3835 2018-06-14 16:58:50 The oil price will shoot up after that Saudi Arabia humiliation #FIFAWorldCup
3836 2018-06-14 16:58:49 YEAH everything's better now aaaaa it was probably just the shock and the fact that I hadn't eaten yet... I'll never make fried eggs ever again if they keep splashing burning oil on my hands like this

3863 2018-06-14 16:58:18 What about US production? Trump claims we are oil independent, yet trump’s big bucks oil pals are raising prices right along with the world market.   USA first, or not, trump?

3877 2018-06-14 16:57:55 Hi Clare, One of our marketing phrases is "A teaspoon or a ton" - Our biotreatment powder could have eliminated the oil from BP's DH & also can clean up fuel spills in your garage, dog poop on your front steps, grease (FOG) in your kitchen drain or septic system. Happy to discuss
3878 2018-06-14 16:57:54 Putin magic have spilled their oil
3879 2018-06-14 16:57:52 Soccer is not Saudi’s talent abeg, let them just concentrate on their oil and tourist attractions

3883 2018-06-14 16:57:49 These Saudi Arabians don't deserve crude oil
3884 2018-06-14 16:57:48 Oil vs Vodka. 5 Pushkin shots to no crude barrel.

3906 2018-06-14 16:57:26 #SaudiArabia could always punish #Russia for the 5-0 drubbing by increasing oil production. That would hit Putin where it really hurts. #WorldCup2018 #WorldCup
3907 2018-06-14 16:57:23 haha Saudis getting karbash ,Oil money didn't help either #WorldCup
3908 2018-06-14 16:57:18 Baby oil is acc the best thing to get tan off, left it on for an hour nd my tan basically wiped off

3913 2018-06-14 16:57:12 Arabians don’t drop bombs. They drop money and drip oil
3914 2018-06-14 16:57:11 #WorldCupRussia2018 what a waste. Those particular people are high on oil.
3915 2018-06-14 16:57:10 Saudi Arabia is an oil rich country
3916 2018-06-14 16:57:09 Drugs or Oil, the only 2 explanations for that result  ...
3917 2018-06-14 16:57:09 @gao_moloabi The Russians have just killed us... The oil price by the end of the World Cup will be ridiculous 
3918 2018-06-14 16:57:06 Russia grabs it over Saudi and made it look easy... 
interestingly the match of the world cup was between the two countries with highest oil production #FIFA18 #RUSKSA #Rusia2018 Battle of oil kings! #battleofoilkings
3919 2018-06-14 16:57:04 Lmao! Saudi Arabia ... focus on your oil. Football is obviously not ur calling.

3975 2018-06-14 16:55:53 What thuggery is this 5 goals.  Saudi will not pump oil in the next 3 weeks. Expect high oil prices.
3976 2018-06-14 16:55:47 #WorldCupRussia2018
How to motivate players
@NGSuperEagles: score a goal and win 500k
Germany: win a match, get free tanks of beer
Brazil: dribble, entertain and win, get free girls
Saudi arabia: defenders get 500passes btw yourselves, free oil wells
3977 2018-06-14 16:55:46 Saudi should stick to selling oil 
3978 2018-06-14 16:55:45 Saudi can buy this game if they want too... With cash or oil and Putin wont even mind 
3979 2018-06-14 16:55:44 Yeah Golovin is elite only elite players have the mentality to stat pad in a situation like that vs oil farmers
3980 2018-06-14 16:55:42 Saudi Arabia should stick to oil
3981 2018-06-14 16:55:41 - “Democracy dies in darkness.” “When they go low, we go high.” Eyeballs are a’rolling.
3982 2018-06-14 16:55:39 Shotgun 10% of your oil bloc, Golovin
3983 2018-06-14 16:55:39 yep, Saudi Arabian oil prices goin up tomorrow

hahahahaha wait lang. Lakas ng loob ko. 
3989 2018-06-14 16:55:33 Using oil terminology - 
Russia = Slick
Saudi Arabia = Crude
3990 2018-06-14 16:55:32 Okay.. SA should concentrate more on oil.
3991 2018-06-14 16:55:31 3kick.... 5-0!!!!!!!!!

Saudi Arabia face in hot oil! Lol
3992 2018-06-14 16:55:31 Lmaoooooooo
Saudi used this match to distract Russia while they drill their oil.
3993 2018-06-14 16:55:28 Saudi Arabia should just concentrate on the oil
3994 2018-06-14 16:55:27 Oil diggers back to shithole
3995 2018-06-14 16:55:23 Russia Cherys opening win, Saudi’s left with it oil to do.
3996 2018-06-14 16:55:23 Too little, too late. My furnace, AC unit, and hot water tank were all made in the US. All of my electronic devices were made in Asia or the US. Why is Canada exporting crude oil to the US and repurchasing refined oil at significantly higher price? Cdns deserve better.
3997 2018-06-14 16:55:22 That box has helped me out in a lot of situations, switched to an oil can once..then I fell and rolled down a hill..needless to say it won't be happening again..

4003 2018-06-14 16:55:07 Hahahahah and theres a 5th aswell hahahahahaha. Go sell Oil Saudia lmaoooo
4004 2018-06-14 16:55:06 Couldn’t agree more @SenatorDinniman. I assume it’s because ME1 is also the one currently making money. 4 out of 5 PUC commissioners are in bed with the oil and gas industry. I’m so incredibly disappointed and discouraged. Thank you for all of your efforts.
4005 2018-06-14 16:55:05 Beverly Hills High School receives around $300,000 per year from a cluster of oil wells on campus.
4006 2018-06-14 16:55:03 Russians are gonna be bathing in oil today
4007 2018-06-14 16:55:02 The battle of the crude oil exporters is won by Russia, cracking start for the home nation I’ve gotta say

4010 2018-06-14 16:54:57 Looool Saudi Arabia really need to stick to oil
4011 2018-06-14 16:54:57 Saudi Arabia should just concentrate on selling carpets & oil. Their soccer is primary school level
4012 2018-06-14 16:54:55 Stick to selling oil
4013 2018-06-14 16:54:52 5-0 oil money!
4014 2018-06-14 16:54:52 Send these oil merchants back to the deserts
4015 2018-06-14 16:54:48 Saudi Arabia must just go back home... Russians and oil are enemies in the kitchen especially in the mornings  what a way to revenge #WorldCupRussia2018 #SuperSportTV bloom 5-0
4016 2018-06-14 16:54:48 This oil derby dieee not not
4017 2018-06-14 16:54:45 YUPE RUSSIA'S OIL IS BETTER

4020 2018-06-14 16:54:39 there's a multi that's biotin enhanced! forgot what it's called but i can send you pics! and the multi that i take has DHA+omega 3 (aka you wouldn't need fish oil separately), so if it's too bothersome to your stomach, might not be good! look into multis + o3
4021 2018-06-14 16:54:39 So I guess that oil deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia is off? #RUSKSA 
4022 2018-06-14 16:54:32 No cheap oil for Russia in the next 5yr. #WorldCupRussia
4023 2018-06-14 16:54:32 The one thing no one can argue is the organization badly messed up in their handling of Puljujarvi from the get-go.
4024 2018-06-14 16:54:30 Saudis no nothing but Twitter pools and increasing oil prices. When its football, its a horror film. 
4025 2018-06-14 16:54:23 You do understand that with the new shale plays in the Permian basin that we can and will be the 3 largest producer of oil?  Then there is Alaska. As for steel, our manufacturing of steel has been completely ham strung by the unlawful ‘dumping’ of cheep steel by China and Mexico.
4026 2018-06-14 16:54:17 just try nd chop wetin oil dey to avoid ulcer
4027 2018-06-14 16:54:15 Saudi Arabian oil money can buy most things, but clearly it can't buy a national football team that wins games. #WorldCup

4030 2018-06-14 16:54:12 Crude oil will fall below $70 soon! Buy OMCs ! HPCL best buy with target of 455/- by Oct 2018 @Geetu_Moza
4031 2018-06-14 16:54:10 Saudi Arabia stick to your oil business...football is a not not not

4033 2018-06-14 16:54:08 ...& a co-worker said, "Oh, did your dad take hemp oil? I know someone who cured her own cancer with hemp oil." So husband did full Bronx voice and said: "NO, BECAUSE IN MY FAMILY WE BELIEVE IN SCIENCE & REASON & ARE ANTI-QUACKERY." 2/2
4034 2018-06-14 16:54:07 Lol why did Russia score that last goal? Saudi Arabia is about to flood them out of the oil market loool  #WorldCup
4035 2018-06-14 16:54:04 Hehehe ..you should come by with some  massage oil then
4036 2018-06-14 16:54:04 Russia 4 - 0 Oil & Gas 
4037 2018-06-14 16:54:02 You have excess tintomato, you are not using immediately... Just pour groundnut oil  untop leave it... It can stay fresh for two weeks...
4038 2018-06-14 16:53:59 I'm still skeptical that it doesn't work on larger batches.  Unmolding a larger batch shouldn't be an issue since it melts so quickly.  I'll try it next time I deep-fry something in a larger quantity.  Do you think a one quart amount of oil would be  sufficiently large as a test?
4039 2018-06-14 16:53:55 Tater transcendence.   Just a tater on a cloud with frying pan wings and a halo of cooking oil.
4040 2018-06-14 16:53:49 They are nice, if you live near a dealer to get them worked on. The V8 Discoveries liked to burn oil and blow gaskets. Knew a guy in Pittsburgh Landing, TN who had a custom shop specializing in vintage ones.
4041 2018-06-14 16:53:46 Saudi arabia should concentrate with mining their oil #RUSKSA
4042 2018-06-14 16:53:44 BONE MEAL!!! Says the snake oil salesman...
4043 2018-06-14 16:53:43 They must stick on producing Oil
4044 2018-06-14 16:53:42 Anyone else get uneasy when your passenger train stops in the middle of nowhere to let a cargo train of predominantly crude oil tanks  pass you slooooooooooowly.
4045 2018-06-14 16:53:41 Saudi Arabia must stick to pumping oil to be honest. Football is far off from their forte
4046 2018-06-14 16:53:38 Cheryshev with a stunner to set alight the tournament! Russia 4-0 Saudi Arabia! The Oil Classico
4047 2018-06-14 16:53:37 KSA is thinking of how score one over Russia in the Oil Fields since it seems impossible on the football field!! #FifaWorldCup2018
4048 2018-06-14 16:53:37 Saudi Arabia  should just forget this football thing. They've got oil though and Russia will still buy from them, they should get their revenge that way.

4050 2018-06-14 16:53:31 Saudi Arabia is definitely raising their oil prices after that one
4051 2018-06-14 16:53:31 Stop it already! They were just here for the oil! Dont do my habibis like that! 4-0 #RUSKSA
4052 2018-06-14 16:53:26 Let’s just say, saudis lucky they have oil and money lol
4053 2018-06-14 16:53:26 So the two biggest oil producing country in the world started the #WorldCupRussia opening game today....
4054 2018-06-14 16:53:22 Ought to stick to mining oil
4055 2018-06-14 16:53:21 But I guess Oil is better than World Cup glory.
4056 2018-06-14 16:53:18 Oil is playing Oil 
4057 2018-06-14 16:53:17 Everybody cannot be fighting all the battle at once. So you choose your fight and make sure you win. This one must be won at all cost. We must #EndSARS and #ReformPoliceNG. I suggest you engage govt on the Niger delta oil spill clean up.. abi nor be dat side u from come? Area!!
4058 2018-06-14 16:53:15 Lmao, these oil cartels (Saudi) are so horrible  #Worldcup2018Russia

4061 2018-06-14 16:53:03 #WorldCup Ahhhhahaa i give up on Saudi Arabia, they are only good at Twitter pools and increasing oil prices. #RUSKSA 4-0 
4062 2018-06-14 16:53:02 Saudi Arabia you can't have it all.Oil
4063 2018-06-14 16:53:00 Saudi Arabia losing 4-0???  oil prices def going up tomorrow
4064 2018-06-14 16:52:59 It’s interesting when Saudi Arabia is signing oil deals, you see a lot of “White Arabs” but now, you see an all “Black” Saudis been humiliated by Russia.
4065 2018-06-14 16:52:56 You are so right. What can be done about it? Of course this affects home heating oil prices, which hurts millions of Americans and reverses much of the benefits of tax cuts.
4066 2018-06-14 16:52:54 Oil + money
4067 2018-06-14 16:52:52 @BelTel The word is SAVE not SAFE...The DUP have given their backing to Northern Ireland boy Billy Caldwell  receiving access to medicinal cannabis oil which his mother says helps  control his seizures and could even safe his life.
4068 2018-06-14 16:52:52 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
4069 2018-06-14 16:52:49 Putin: You lost, Saudis. Give us your oil. #Worldcup2018Russia
4070 2018-06-14 16:52:48 Oil about to sky rocket tomorrow 
4071 2018-06-14 16:52:47 Only if Oil could score goals..
4072 2018-06-14 16:52:42 No Goals no Oil for the rest of the world
4073 2018-06-14 16:52:41 Russia should just stop, before the prices of crude oil will rise sharply.
4074 2018-06-14 16:52:39 Oil prices going up x4 from tomorrow now that Saudi Arabia lost  #WorldCup
4075 2018-06-14 16:52:39 Today's Focaccia:

4076 2018-06-14 16:52:36 Go back to drinking oil Saudi Arabia

4081 2018-06-14 16:52:27 Saudi Arabia should stick to oil. #RUSKSA
4082 2018-06-14 16:52:27 This girl was up wayyy before me . I woke up hella late.....and I still managed to get up...brush my teeth...shower...get dressed...get a oil change/tires rotated...and be in Monroe wayy before her...that is ridiculous!!
4083 2018-06-14 16:52:26 Russia oil stronger than Saudi oil it would seem
4084 2018-06-14 16:52:23 The Russians deadass aren’t getting any oil from now on
4085 2018-06-14 16:52:19 Two more goals and Putin coming for the oil next
4086 2018-06-14 16:52:18 Saudi can fall back on that oil money. I just fell bad for the black men
4087 2018-06-14 16:52:17 Oil money boys getting trashed!
4088 2018-06-14 16:52:14 Did Saudi Arabia qualify through beating qualifiers or oil money?  #RUSKSA #shitshow
4089 2018-06-14 16:52:14 I've already gone grocery shopping, got gas, and got an oil change and none of my family is up yet 

I need to mooch some free post-trip laundry off my mom so she needs to get up and at em dangit

4093 2018-06-14 16:51:58 Charley den sell.the match oooo for oil
4094 2018-06-14 16:51:57 hold on hold on. bake with oil? like apply the oil first then apply foundation then concealer?
4095 2018-06-14 16:51:55 I'm ok with uljujarvi ending up with 97 or 29 but still belive if Lucic is still around, I'd play him with Leon and Puljujarvi and focus on getting McDavid & RNH a winger. I don't mind Rattie but that can't be the Plan A going into the season.
4096 2018-06-14 16:51:51 Hmm looks like Russia's oil is better
4097 2018-06-14 16:51:51 Russia draining the oil in Saudi
4098 2018-06-14 16:51:47 Oil and gas playing. One is fluid, the other is such a drag. 4-0!
4099 2018-06-14 16:51:47 So we’re now equating 50 years to a billion years?! For the record, 1 billion years is 20 million times longer than 50 years. To equate solar and oil in terms of finite resources is quite silly.
4100 2018-06-14 16:51:37 Convictions, guilty pleas of many around you, your own personal swamp. You are NOT above the law. Sell your snake oil to the ignorant, none for me-thanks.
4101 2018-06-14 16:51:36 One more for the oil
4102 2018-06-14 16:51:31 Got coconut oil in my hair and a face mask on my face and I ain’t worried about shit. Life is beautiful.
4103 2018-06-14 16:51:29 How did Saudi Arabia even qualify for this thought they were fast food eating oil merchants
4104 2018-06-14 16:51:28 Saudi Arabia is Oil. And they are playing, albeit losing.
4105 2018-06-14 16:51:26 My first car stooped workin on da a side of the highway so i just left it there, my second car i aint get an oil change for a good 6 month so the engine popped lls
4106 2018-06-14 16:51:19 I think the Saudis should stick to producing oil
4107 2018-06-14 16:51:17 you should practice putting castor oil on your eyebrows and eyelashes 
4108 2018-06-14 16:51:04 3)  We then see a boat load of dark figure with Osama bin Laden beckoning them.  And oil nodding donkeys with oil dripping into the sea of discontent.  Statue of Liberty is followed by life being strangled before birth by a devillish figure, reference to abortion & eating babies?

4114 2018-06-14 16:50:46 Is coconut oil actually good for skin? Cause I've been seeing mixed reviews and don't exactly know if it works.
4115 2018-06-14 16:50:40 Eh? Prices are set according to the value to the customer (i.e. the highest price the market will bear, and the floor price is set by oil), not the cost of production. Low costs=high margins, making for potentially high profits.
4116 2018-06-14 16:50:38 America

4117 2018-06-14 16:50:34 Yea idk wat kind I went on their page & couldn’t find it it if u read on packaging it does say bake with oil then do foundation let me try find the package

4123 2018-06-14 16:49:52 Russia 3 V Saudi Arabia. 

Saudi Arabia should just pack their luggage, go home  ,forget football and concentrate on their crude oil. Lol
4124 2018-06-14 16:49:40 Oil be the judge of that one
4125 2018-06-14 16:49:36 Saudi should stick to selling oil. Football isn’t for them 
4126 2018-06-14 16:49:35 Oh my. I'm shocked. I have never seen anything like this from coal, oil and gas money. In this case calling for Pruitt to resign is the right thing to do. Wrong is wrong. Or it used to be.
4127 2018-06-14 16:49:35 I don't disagree with some of that but to be fair, the roster was so poorly constructed his hands were kind of tied when it came to trying to shelter some guys. Add to that the use of Caggiula & Slepyshev, and it snowballed in a hurry.
4128 2018-06-14 16:49:28 Considering they are the two world’s top producing oil countries, I expected the football to be slick. #WorldCup2018 #RUSvsSAU
4129 2018-06-14 16:49:21 Saudi oil money??
4130 2018-06-14 16:49:15 Brazil lost to Germany in 2014 because they won't allow the US to drill for oil in the Amazon.

4133 2018-06-14 16:49:01 If you only look at onshore oil, you can find an increase. But that ignores natgas decline (onshore and off) and essentially no change for offshore oil. Oh yeah, and that is while total US production was exploding.
4134 2018-06-14 16:49:00 I have to stay @ Walmart for 3 1/2 hours just for an oil change.. I’m seriously living a nightmare
4135 2018-06-14 16:48:52 Oil money and Saudi players have 0 correlation
4136 2018-06-14 16:48:41 England and Major tournaments are like oil and water. But yeah fearing no France players. If Lukaku flops griezzman is coming straight In. You made a team?
4137 2018-06-14 16:48:39 Check out big oil taking hundreds of billions in profit while we pay for price increases to the product.
4138 2018-06-14 16:48:36 This sort of stuff used to be called and sold as snake oil didn’t it...?
4139 2018-06-14 16:48:34 Russia out here trying to drive up oil prices.
4140 2018-06-14 16:48:27 Anak mandi pagi, udah dipakein baju lengkap, nitip bapaknya suruh pakein hair lotion sama parfume.
Hasil : setelah 6 jam rambutnya masih klimis, ternyata dipakeinnya baby oil

Kapok.
4141 2018-06-14 16:48:25 Saudi Arabia needs to apologise to everyone for this game and reduce oil prices as compensation.
4142 2018-06-14 16:48:22 Oh! Didn't know that!  The oil was a thing l never thought of  Thanks for the info - Illinois will be making it legal for rec use soon!  
4143 2018-06-14 16:48:16 With patience/persistence & the right blend of natural oils such as coconut oil, jojoba oil or grapeseed oil (AKA nature's oils), applying them externally can help smoothen, clear, & brighten your skin up

4148 2018-06-14 16:48:02 A 2 oil technique works here. First in a pan of oil (300 degree ish), then into our fryer, which maxes at about 375.

When the Kosher Salt is added I pee myself a little bit in anticipation, but that step is optional.
4149 2018-06-14 16:48:02 use vitamin e oil or even polysporin (which also has vit e oil in it)
4150 2018-06-14 16:47:57 Saudi Arabia ago cut oil output after this 
4151 2018-06-14 16:47:49 whenever i update a drawing for minjoon au a photo of joon smiling really cute and trusting appears and i feel like drowning in boiling oil im sorry my baby
4152 2018-06-14 16:47:46 Also Tyldesley keeps making jokes that the Saudi prince and Putin are bargaining over oil prices which is a bit off, but also deffo happening.

In 8 years all I ever heard was two words - constitution and process. Biggest problem in Scot is economy, what replaces oil, sooner we start talking about that the better
4160 2018-06-14 16:47:09 Fake news.
They're snaking africa for that oil money.
4161 2018-06-14 16:46:58 Baby oil rumble!
4162 2018-06-14 16:46:58 The person who brought that sugar shld b boiled in a huge pot with very hot used oil..... He/she apart  from being an enemy of the state is an enemy of humanity.
4163 2018-06-14 16:46:55 ぎゅーっ><
4164 2018-06-14 16:46:37 Mr godwin just look for griundnut oil and fry it that is how to cook indomie
4165 2018-06-14 16:46:30 I getcha SB. But at $19 b/e and the price of oil. Adding chunks to production is valid and adds to the bottom line. Thats cash coming inbound. The fruit gets tastier as you say. Big deep drill happening next door now that couod add significantly to WW #BLOE below ipo
4166 2018-06-14 16:46:25 Each time that I've done this, the presence of gelatin/water has interfered with fat crystallization in the used oil, and it's required more than 15 hours to re-solidify. (Coconut oil is like chocolate, with many different fat crystal type that have different properties).

4169 2018-06-14 16:46:13 Things Saudi Arabia is good at: 
- producing oil
- driving Ferrari’s
- having cheetahs as pets 

Things Saudi Arabia is not good at: 
- soccer
4170 2018-06-14 16:46:12 Oil prices have increased in Russia
4171 2018-06-14 16:46:06 Russian oil have better mileage than Saudi oil its official  #RUSvSA
4172 2018-06-14 16:46:03 I’m talking about the dairy industry lol. Not the energy industry. And you guys should build a pipe to Asia because the USA is a net oil EXPORTER. Not an importer anymore. We don’t need your oil now the fracking ban has been lifted. Thanks trump again.
4173 2018-06-14 16:45:57 Says Captain Bone Spurs who just sold out to the type of dictator the US would have gone to war to get rid of if North Korea had oil and a shit military that could easily be beaten
4174 2018-06-14 16:45:28 He fucken broke his oil pan in the highway  that’s why I’m not static fuck all that 
4175 2018-06-14 16:45:14 love laying in the sun with coco oil on then showering after and feeling silky af!!!!!!!
4176 2018-06-14 16:45:13 #WorldCupRussia2018
Saudi Arabia down by 3 goals to nil and the fans are ecstatic.
One thing is on their mind; We are Oil country and not Footballing country
4177 2018-06-14 16:45:09 It's a done deal. "Vodka is mightier than the oil".
#2018WorldCup #openingmatch
4178 2018-06-14 16:45:07 Do your scrambled eggs slide off  your non-stick pan if you don’t use oil or butter? If not it might be time to replace it. #kitchenhacks #eatsmartlivesmarter
4179 2018-06-14 16:45:06 frank: h-

stans: HANG ME UP ON A MEAT HOOK SKIN ME A L IVE AND B OIL MY E YES
4180 2018-06-14 16:45:05 You'd think with all that oil money, #SaudiArabia would sign some decent players? I can't understand it!

#WorldCup
4181 2018-06-14 16:45:03 But rather something of a diffuse cloud. The heat needed to melt/unmold several quarts of coconut oil from a large pot are entirely different, the surface area is much greater, the melt of gelatin and oil more significant.
4182 2018-06-14 16:44:52 #SaudiArabia might as well go home now because they only came to Russia to negotiate oil deals with Putin. #Worldcup2018Russia #RUSSAU
4183 2018-06-14 16:44:49 With all that oil money, you’d think #SaudiArabia would field a better team. US universities have figured out how to do that with the pro sports teams they sponsor. #Worldcup2018 #worldcup
4184 2018-06-14 16:44:48 —gaze to that conceited smile, sliding onto his lips like oil on water. "Ooh~... I believe I could, yes," she said softly. Her hand dropped to her thigh lazily, her fingers touching the steel beneath the cotton. "I wouldn't sell me short, darling. I'm /full/ of surprises."
4185 2018-06-14 16:44:46 Russia too get oil
4186 2018-06-14 16:44:44 Unreal. Why is Alberta even part of this country? The province would be better off on its own and working with the US to get oil to the market.
4187 2018-06-14 16:44:42 i tried out one of my pineapple soaps (totally like 3 weeks before i should (thats only because theyre still losing water)) and its actually really nice? its not super bubbly just because its mostly coconut oil but i love it.
4188 2018-06-14 16:44:41 One oil well from Salman to FIFA president and Saudi Arabia will take the trophy home tonight only!!! #RUSKSA
4189 2018-06-14 16:44:34 Saudi Arabia is losing the oil war. #WorldCup
4190 2018-06-14 16:44:32 Interesting. Didn't realise it was that bad but yeah since they use a lot of coconut oil to make the burger juice I can definitely see that to be true.
4191 2018-06-14 16:44:31 Oil money buys good players not Saudi Arabia players 
4192 2018-06-14 16:44:30 Their oil wears turban.
It's their Coal playing.
4193 2018-06-14 16:44:27 If you can't stand the goat meat taste use coconut oil to fry it ... thank me later
4194 2018-06-14 16:44:23 Wonder how many barrels of oil it cost for #SaudiArabia to get into #WorldCupRussia2018? 
An absolutely pathethic excuse for footballers!
4195 2018-06-14 16:44:22 Ooh we’d love to have you on board for our sustainable palm oil city! Can I send you some info? 
4196 2018-06-14 16:44:22 the draw accelerated. because they won't get any product (due to input costs) from Padd1 or 3 from where they import. They can run at 100% and still draw down on product. Summer light oil is in higher demand. that can also increase takeaway capacity from Cushing.
4197 2018-06-14 16:44:20 #RUSvKSA is like Gas vs Oil.
4198 2018-06-14 16:44:11 This is something I've done at least a half dozen times with 2-quart+ batches of fry oil, contaminated by real world use (cannoli and doughnuts, mostly). The logistics and reality of micro-batches don't compare. When I've tested this, the gelatin raft has not formed neatly.
4199 2018-06-14 16:44:07 Finally getting my brakes changed rn y’all  and an oil change.....thank God!
4200 2018-06-14 16:44:04 i'm out of lavender essential oil
4201 2018-06-14 16:44:01 Tuang setetes lavender oil ke bantal anda niscaya anda akan tidur nyenyak.

Yg terjadi malah mual2 mau muntah bukan nyenyak 
4202 2018-06-14 16:43:55 i know right.. 
whats worse i literally grew up surrounded by them, , i'm fine with olive oil but actual olives, the taste just make me retch
4203 2018-06-14 16:43:52 Saudi Arabia should just go back to oil, Football is not their calling...
4204 2018-06-14 16:43:46 the oil classico is lowkey boring #WorldCupRussia2018
4205 2018-06-14 16:43:42 Adeniyi Adejoke received N52300 from Chinemerem Egwim being payment for Palm Oil
4206 2018-06-14 16:43:42 I agree! I have the elixir oil and my skin is so much better since using it! 
4207 2018-06-14 16:43:41 I'm a college dropout who doesn't follow politics hardly and I change oil for a living and I knew that.
4208 2018-06-14 16:43:24 Saudi Arabia proving that oil money can buy many things except good home footballers

4213 2018-06-14 16:43:07 @saudiarabia should just go home and continue mining oil
4214 2018-06-14 16:43:06 My whole house smell like Cashmere woods ! 
Best scented oil .. don’t @ me
4215 2018-06-14 16:43:05 This saudi sure throw game, they don't want Russia to take their oil
4216 2018-06-14 16:43:05 Sitting at @TropicalFord waiting on an oil change on the #Fusion. Nice comfortable and they even have the #littleredbus here from @my1blood for donations.

4222 2018-06-14 16:42:50 This is why Gej. Failed despite the oil boom in his time.
Its simply because he surrounded himself with people like Renos
4223 2018-06-14 16:42:49 KSA will increase oil prices to $200 by tonight... you cant embarrass Saudis like this.  #WorldCup
4224 2018-06-14 16:42:45 my hair doesn’t fw coconut oil but it loves jamaican castor oil
4225 2018-06-14 16:42:44 oil?
4226 2018-06-14 16:42:43 Sounds like any other commodity based industry.  Ever heard of oil and gas?
4227 2018-06-14 16:42:41 Russia will crush the market by offloading barrels upon barrels of oil on the market.
4228 2018-06-14 16:42:35 Still resume today, Mathijs?
4229 2018-06-14 16:42:34 Oil is what Saudi arabis is good atbot this filth #RUSKSA

4231 2018-06-14 16:42:33 What's to celebrate when we have a Sec. of Interior leasing out monuments & other public lands to oil-gas-coal-welfare ranchers?  Teddy Roosevelt is rolling over in his grave. Pivot to conservation!--Bull____!
4232 2018-06-14 16:42:30 They've probably been wagering oil prices!! 
4233 2018-06-14 16:42:29 . Okay Brown. You got it fam. My money shouldn't b what you took out of it. Also a year ago.?? Time for oil change big dawg.

4240 2018-06-14 16:42:13 Shame oil can't buy you a decent football team. #RUSKSA
4241 2018-06-14 16:42:12 #GOPTaxScam Snake Oil push continues. The reality is any savings normal workers got is more than negated by higher health costs & interest rates (directly caused by tax scam) and higher gas prices (caused by GOP breaking Iran deal). The GOP is inept and corrupt.
4242 2018-06-14 16:42:10 Not sure there's the same problem with imitation avocado oil but apparently it will solidify
4243 2018-06-14 16:41:59 Dermatologist prescribed face wash, Noxema pads, rose water, ambi fade cream or bio oil

I hope Saudis are not going to hike the price of crude oil X3 to punish entire world for watching being humiliated just for Cup
4249 2018-06-14 16:41:42 I love brussels sprouts roasted with olive oil and parmesan.
4250 2018-06-14 16:41:41 Saudi Arabia needs to invest heavily in diversifying its economy away from oil ... and in fullbacks.
4251 2018-06-14 16:41:39 ใจเย็นๆ สงครามยังไม่จบ สู้!!
4252 2018-06-14 16:41:36 It's  evident  infantino ate the oil money and he had to give a free pass to these Arabs 
4253 2018-06-14 16:41:29 Oil price dropping like the Saudis?
4254 2018-06-14 16:41:29 Let me help you. They're back to charging for school because the quality was too low when it was fully subsidized, and NHS is such a dumpster fire that a bad flu season last winter caused them to postpone surgeries. It looks kind of like when Venezuela took over the oil industry.
4255 2018-06-14 16:41:28 oil price hike incoming in 3 2 1 #WorldCup
4256 2018-06-14 16:41:18 With all that oil money they invested in man city and PSG maybe they should invest in middle east football first. #shite
4257 2018-06-14 16:41:16 No oil money here lol
4258 2018-06-14 16:41:15 Corey is another snake oil salesman charlatan tent preacher expecting to get elected because of the privilege of his skin color. Well, we suffered 8 yrs of Barry for the same reason. So, no thanks Corey. We're doing GREAT greater than ever before thanks to @realDonaldTrump 
4259 2018-06-14 16:41:15 Did this Suadi team come to Russia to play football or to drill oil?
4260 2018-06-14 16:41:09 The one thing you CAN do something about but since you're rich and hang out with your rich oil pimping buddy's won't. Keep making fake news or man up and help the people that didn't vote you into office.
4261 2018-06-14 16:41:08 Two nations with oil and weapons
4262 2018-06-14 16:41:08 my mom and grandma are having a legit screaming match over the "correct" way to make aglio e olio (literally: garlic and oil). in case any of you were wondering how much of the Jersey-Italian stereotypes are true.
4263 2018-06-14 16:41:07 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
4264 2018-06-14 16:41:05 If you want to transport oil through BC, you're going to have to figure out another route, another form (ie: bitumen balls) Be creative.

4282 2018-06-14 16:40:24 But what is the status of oil today
4283 2018-06-14 16:40:21 Nice to see the President of Russia and the Salman of Saudi Arabia seizing this opportunity and making the most of the first game of the 2018 World Cup to negotiate what is very clearly an oil deal 
4284 2018-06-14 16:40:12 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
4285 2018-06-14 16:40:11 Oil 3-0 Oil

4288 2018-06-14 16:40:05 this is coming as a shock to me & has sent me into a deep spiral of depression resulting from the disillusionment this confession has caused

im still gonna do the coconut oil enema, though
4289 2018-06-14 16:40:05 sophie made her first track it's okay to cry to prepare us for the emotional rollercoaster which is oil of every pearls un-insides she really said it's okay to cry because I sure fucking did
4290 2018-06-14 16:40:03 I was running late to my oil change so now I have to sit here for an hour without my Starbucks. Rough life.
4291 2018-06-14 16:40:00 Then when it's flushed, it all comes out the back, like an oil slick. 
4292 2018-06-14 16:39:57 Life comes at you fast
4293 2018-06-14 16:39:56 (when it's ripe, if it's not ripe it tastes like cardboard ) You cut the plantain into slices and then you put them on an frying pan with some oil. But DEFINITELY don't eat it raw. It tastes really bad 
4294 2018-06-14 16:39:55 I’m most likely going to get sun poisoning with all this baby oil 
4295 2018-06-14 16:39:52 I want to write all day long, but my mundane day job takes up my time. So I burn the midnight oil where my imagination spills onto a screen.

4308 2018-06-14 16:39:09 Show some respect kid it's the oil of the middle east that made you relevant, otherwise you would be a Chelsea fan right about now repping Bakayoko or whatever clown equivalent to Silva in Chelsea's team.

4316 2018-06-14 16:38:37 This Russia vs Saudi is a smoke screen for an oil deal. Every time Russians scored, Putin shook the sheik’s hand.  #worldcup
4317 2018-06-14 16:38:34 Oil deal
4318 2018-06-14 16:38:33 1million%  the 2 biggest oil countries in the world aswell  sweet business

4320 2018-06-14 16:38:32 So this is what an oil well looks like
4321 2018-06-14 16:38:25 Those who try to come for Iris or #WestAllen aren't even blips on my radar. I've spent too much time as it is going at it with the Oil City fandom as it is. My thing is Iris Ann West-Allen is going to thrive as is her marriage and KC is back on Error in S7. All good.
4322 2018-06-14 16:38:19 Got an oil change for my Ford Escape that already has 150K miles on it, and it feels like it has a new life. #RevTheEngine #SheAintDeadYet

4330 2018-06-14 16:37:56 Saw Putin talk to the Arab guy just now during the match. Must be talking about the crazy expensive oil price during raya. He convinced Putin price will go down if Russia losses intentionally. 

Putin doesn’t like the idea. 3 nil Russia up!
4331 2018-06-14 16:37:52 Use a brush to 'paint' a homogeneous layer of oil onto the plate bottom.
4332 2018-06-14 16:37:49 Fox has had nary a mention of OPEC, oil, NOPEC, Novak or Al-Falih. So much for that drinking game.
4333 2018-06-14 16:37:43 Saudi Arabia is a South Africa with crude oil. Their soccer is wacky #Russia2018 #RUS 3 #KSA 0
4334 2018-06-14 16:37:41 Think the Saudi's should stick to camel's and oil!

4342 2018-06-14 16:37:03 Stupid Kenyans led by idiots. We budget 4.5B to export oil. I thought this mineral should export itself, pay the drillers, pay the cartels and then anything remaining given to Gvt(for cartels round 2). #BudgetKE2018

4345 2018-06-14 16:36:33 Saudi Arabia are more dependant on that left back than they are on their oil
4346 2018-06-14 16:36:33 Rather than banning their women to watch the matches, #SaudiArabia should've banned their men to get into the football field. Absolute waste of a spot at the WC. With all that oil money, may try to launch a WC of Camel Polo or something. #WorldCup
4347 2018-06-14 16:36:32 Need to watch for an oil rally. Saudis could stop hiking the output after this match.

4363 2018-06-14 16:36:00 I don't know if you've ever seen the Norweigan TV series "Occupied" in which Russia invades Norway to control it's oil production. It's all too scary and plausible even more now. It's available online and has had 2 seasons, the first the best because esp. now in the Time of Trump
4364 2018-06-14 16:35:53 I see a lot of oil going to Russia by tomorrow lmao

4375 2018-06-14 16:35:30 Do You think the Oil price will go up now?
4376 2018-06-14 16:35:29 Didn’t even put that much oil on today.  Da. Piss.

4392 2018-06-14 16:35:03 Are you working with used, leftover fry oil? I've attempted this several times, and it has been absolutely disastrous. What quantity are you working with? What was fried in it?
4393 2018-06-14 16:35:03 Or the Saudi Arabia guy said for each goal Russia scores they get an oil well thinking it would only be 1 goal
4394 2018-06-14 16:35:02 Russia's tactics were simple. That sub was introduced for long balls. Saudis still couldn't figure it out. They should focus on selling oil.

OPEC nations will fall to 0-1 in the #WorldCup2018 if this result holds.

Meaningless stats, but fun meaningless stats.

4414 2018-06-14 16:34:25 Frying tofu is a huge hassle and mess. For most stir fry dishes I just slice + lay the pieces in my biggest pan(s) and slowly cook them to dryness- minimal oil, an occasional squish with a spatula while I do other food prep. usually by the time a side is dry they flip no problem
4415 2018-06-14 16:34:22 That 3rd goal was a confirmation that prices for oil products from Saudi Arabia will sky rocket
4416 2018-06-14 16:34:22 If only Oil prices could go as low as Saudi Arabia’s confidence in this match. #WorldCup #RUSKSA
4417 2018-06-14 16:34:20 Still have my fingers crossed that Clive Tyldesley won’t make it through the second half without uttering something like ‘you’ve got to feel for the Saudis - first the oil price collapses and now this...’

4435 2018-06-14 16:33:50 Ohhhhhhh  that's 100% plantain. When it's green...its better to slice it really thin and fry it in oil. It makes great chips. And when it's ripe and yellow..its better to boil it and eat it with curry or something. Don't peel it and eat it like bananas though.
4436 2018-06-14 16:33:50 Oil prices gonna rise. #KSA #RUS
4437 2018-06-14 16:33:46 No Oil for Russia this year after the 3 goals they scored against Saudi Arabia

4450 2018-06-14 16:33:24 I had an oil change appointment at 10.. it’s 11:30 and I’m still here at the dealership 
4451 2018-06-14 16:33:24 Russia have to be careful here. If they score a few more and Saudi might cut oil prices.
4452 2018-06-14 16:33:23 Ooooh heat up some tomato slices in vodka and olive oil and pepper and salt and maybe cumin and then a layer of havarti over the browns then the tomato mess on top fuck I'm hungry

Hope you get some peace, Skunk.

4465 2018-06-14 16:33:08 Saudi Arabia lose so global oil prices ago sky rocket
4466 2018-06-14 16:33:07 Mr Oil merchant and Putin everytime Russia scores:

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
4467 2018-06-14 16:33:05 And you think that would suddenly increase the use of domestic oil? Wrong. Most refineries in Canada are not new and are not geared up to refine the most "popular" domestic oil. If EE had gone ahead most of the oil would have been exported. That is why KM is so important.
4468 2018-06-14 16:33:04 @ge_kaitlyn - moral argument, but it could be applied so widely. i.e. drive a car? oil companies do not have a good historical record on numerous fronts; eg environmental issues + top dogs in the military/industrial complex known for lobbying for war etc. are you culpable?

4474 2018-06-14 16:32:54 Russia vs Saudi Arabia, winner takes all the oil #WorldCup .
4475 2018-06-14 16:32:52 Much like Vitol, Gunvor and Glencore with oil price.
4476 2018-06-14 16:32:48 Watching the destruction of the country I love by a corrupt, ignorant, snake oil salesman is quite disheartening. Seeing a person not even legitimately in office destroy norms does make me angry. An election stolen by foreigners to advantage a thief should also make you angry.
4477 2018-06-14 16:32:42 They are better at other things. Like oil for instance
4478 2018-06-14 16:32:39 ปล่อยเถอะ อย่าไปคิดตาม มันเหนื่อย
4479 2018-06-14 16:32:38 Well that’s the oil deal sorted!
#FIFA18WorldCup
4480 2018-06-14 16:32:34 you can look into petreleaf‘s CBD oil for dogs. USDA certified organic. i highly recommend it as a person who gives it to my dog for anxiety.
4481 2018-06-14 16:32:32 Oil vey! #RUSSAU
4482 2018-06-14 16:32:31 The Russians are running riot against an oil giant at the Kazan Arena. Something I didn't think I'd be writing even just a couple of months ago. #WorldCup
4483 2018-06-14 16:32:30 3-0 for #Russia at #WorldCupRussia2018 in Big #Oil Derby.
4484 2018-06-14 16:32:25 Oil from corn is natural? Good grief. Perhaps he can demonstrate the natural process for extracting oil from corn for us. It would be enlightening I'm sure.
4485 2018-06-14 16:32:21 The loser of this game has to cut its crude oil supply. Looks like it will be #KSA #WorldCup
4486 2018-06-14 16:32:20 WTI oil at $67.03/barrel, +$0.39.
4487 2018-06-14 16:32:18 @HandofEmery crude oil price will b 100 US dollar by tomorrow!!
4488 2018-06-14 16:32:17 On who can use a bottle of baby oil the fastest?
4489 2018-06-14 16:32:14 Nuclear Weapon 3 - 0 Oil Money
4490 2018-06-14 16:32:14 Winner takes Oil
4491 2018-06-14 16:32:12 Damn Saudi just go home and drill more oil.
4492 2018-06-14 16:32:11 Got them to!  Gather every Patriot we can before Midterms.  Some of us (me) will be stifled but with a great number of us tweets and campaigning will succeed.
4493 2018-06-14 16:32:00 3 goals, these oil drillers are useless
4494 2018-06-14 16:31:57 Oil prices are surely going up after this
4495 2018-06-14 16:31:54 Wooooow.  Oil prices gone skyhigh now
4496 2018-06-14 16:31:53 They will still have the oil! #KSA #WorldCup
4497 2018-06-14 16:31:51 WHO'S GOT MORE OIL?
4498 2018-06-14 16:31:50 Looool Saudi go back to selling oil #RUSKSA
4499 2018-06-14 16:31:49 "damn oil got me as I put the bacon down in the pan take over I haven't put the sasuge or eggs to cook yet my hand stings" puts his hand in a bowl of ice water Theban put on counter for his dad
4500 2018-06-14 16:31:48 Saudi Arabia getting drilled. And I’m not talking about oil. #FIFAWorldCup
4501 2018-06-14 16:31:46 Get the hell out oil merchants
4502 2018-06-14 16:31:43 if you commit a crime, you are arrested and sep. from your children whether you are a citizen or not. They are committing a crime when they cross the border illegally. People wait for years to get a visa to come in here legally. They cut the line.
4503 2018-06-14 16:31:35 If you're a supporter of Tommy Robinson yes. Saudi's & Russia might be leading the way when it comes to Oil but football hell naw
4504 2018-06-14 16:31:34 Are we having a fair play?
I hope no OIL MONEY change hands
#IamAnas
4505 2018-06-14 16:31:27 I miss you too!!! Hope all is well
4506 2018-06-14 16:31:23 うわぁぁぁぁぁ！！！！
4507 2018-06-14 16:31:18 Vlad we have the goals asking sheikh ma balls if he wants round 2 football cough up the oil
4508 2018-06-14 16:31:17 That oil lajan!!!
4509 2018-06-14 16:31:13 Middle East needs to sell oil to someone. They can't drink oil and survive!
4510 2018-06-14 16:31:12 That's because ONGC is mainly in crude oil business, but RIL has a diverse range of business.
Moreover PSUs are never as effective as private organisation.
4511 2018-06-14 16:31:12 Yes pollen is awful at the moment. I think it’s the rapeseed oil. Pretty to look at but it’s a nightmare to live next to
4512 2018-06-14 16:31:02 How did Saudi Arabia make it too the world cup??thru oil dealing perhaps 
4513 2018-06-14 16:30:57 "I'll buy all of your oil!"
4514 2018-06-14 16:30:55 It is your GOP now a/k/a “The Trump GOP”. The cowardly Republicans have allowed this “snake oil” salesman to hijack whatever principles the “Grand Old Party” ever had. Do something about it or just shut up!
4515 2018-06-14 16:30:49 *she had rushed around the hotel lobby and kitchen gathering what she needed. She heard the screams and tried not to panick* 
uh oh! I better make it a good one! 
*franticly she soaked a magazine in cooking oil and set a match to it. She wafted the smoke to the fire alarm*
4516 2018-06-14 16:30:46 Blend 2 tablespoons yogurt with 3 pints celery. Mix in Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve in 3 inch slices
4517 2018-06-14 16:30:43 I use pomegranate seed oil as a facial oil. It also helps.
4518 2018-06-14 16:30:41 You know if you go to Library of Congress they've made laws because of the reason to protect the powerhouses and we need to get it to where Congress can no longer make laws that are just going to help big oil and big Pharma
4519 2018-06-14 16:30:38 These countries have more in common than you might suspect. #Russia is #1 in #oil production; Saudi #2. Saudi is #1 in producing billionaires connected to the ruling family; Russia #2. But Russia gets the edge over KSA in a key metric—interference in US elections (#1 vs #4).
4520 2018-06-14 16:30:35 I heard castor oil ends up making hair worse in the end ¿
4521 2018-06-14 16:30:29 The pipeline to the BC coast will triple the capacity and will enable the Oil and gas industry to access overseas markets.
4522 2018-06-14 16:30:23 It was a deal, whoever concedes first had to give up all their oil. #السعودية_روسيا #Russia2018
4523 2018-06-14 16:30:17 These countries might love their oil, but there’s nothing SLICK at all about their passing.

4524 2018-06-14 16:30:12 If ur a dry skin, dry hair kinda gal i truly believe coconut oil will change your life
4525 2018-06-14 16:30:10 tea tree oil smells nasty as fuck
4526 2018-06-14 16:29:57 How is the 'BULK' of the geographical share in Scotland?  How woud it be easy for Scotland to remain sole owners of North sea oil after independence its not gong to happen.
4527 2018-06-14 16:29:54 Maybe some innocent "Poor son of headmaster".... Gone Bonkers over "Japani oil" advertisement in the newspaper.

4530 2018-06-14 16:29:38 No, the USA needs to end #ethanol, as it has done much damage to the environment; especially in my home state of #Iowa. Plus, the Federal government needs to stop subsidizing ethanol & big oil. It needs to stop subsidies period.
4531 2018-06-14 16:29:31 India depends on middle east for oil & can't antagonise them .
4532 2018-06-14 16:29:27 Ksh800M to clean Nrb river? Why not first arrest those mechanics who drain used oil into the river at Grogan.

4534 2018-06-14 16:29:15 This game is dreadful. King of Saudi might as well put a few oil barrels out on the pitch. Passes just bouncing off players all over the gaff. #WorldCup
4535 2018-06-14 16:29:09 Clive has been on form in this match, my favourite was him saying Putin and the Saudi king have been doing an oil deal and ‘you’ll see it at the pumps on Saturday ‘
4536 2018-06-14 16:29:08 Its a crude tactic but oil bet it will work
4537 2018-06-14 16:29:01 Samuel oil
4538 2018-06-14 16:28:57 50% beneath sea? Well with @realDonaldTrump the current @EPA and all the fracking, oil burning and sofort pretty soon that percentage will be a lot higher. So the lesson is; explore your beaches and Bob Ballard will have a lot more ocean to explore.
4539 2018-06-14 16:28:54 crude oil 3rd call . only for client ?? monthly 600/800 guaranteed crude 50/60 points copper

4541 2018-06-14 16:28:45 I wonder how different this game would be is the Russian oligarchs and the Arab princes piled their oil billions into their national game rather than Chelsea, City, PSG etc... #RUSSAU #WorldCup2018
4542 2018-06-14 16:28:38 Seems I have to ask this of every Virginia Democrat governor: Is there any place in the US where you do NOT oppose drilling for oil?

4548 2018-06-14 16:28:19 when i get to nissan to get a oil change and the attendant is like ‘girl where is your shift knob’ 
4549 2018-06-14 16:28:19 #LIBYA: #Oil ports of #RasLanuf and #EsSider have been evacuated due to clashes between Libyan National Army (#LNA)  and Benghazi Defence Brigades (#BDB).
4550 2018-06-14 16:28:19 So how come other industries don't deserve equal protection as dairy farmers.  Perhaps a 300% tariff on foreign oil?
4551 2018-06-14 16:28:18 Ayyo, I really need to get a quick solution to my black holes situation. But I'll try get some almond oil and apply it everyday. Thanks!

4557 2018-06-14 16:27:50 Don't forget to give him some canned tuna from like once a week because the oil will help his skin!!
4558 2018-06-14 16:27:44 Back behind the wheel. I feel relieved knowing I’ve at least got fresh engine oil flowing. Anticipating approximately two hours to handle liquidation, and then I’ll be back to cleaning house. I have so much inventory to list... Catch you on the flip side! 
4559 2018-06-14 16:27:43 It's turning out to be a lovely evening for planting at the Wonderwall!

4564 2018-06-14 16:27:25 There is ONLY ONE essential OIL! Holy Spirit !!!
4565 2018-06-14 16:27:24 A seed & a bean together create a whole protein.
(beans & rice)

My breakfast earlier was oats with peanut butter & pumpkin seeds, a protein grand slam.

As an oil, it can be used in great versatility.
4566 2018-06-14 16:27:18 That’s got to be it. He is nowhere near as wealthy as he wants the world to believe. He’s a fraud. A snake oil salesman. Right @realDonaldTrump ??? People are saying.
4567 2018-06-14 16:27:15 気が狂いそうになってきた
4568 2018-06-14 16:27:02 Russia  coming for Saudi Arabia like it was a field of oil . “I must break you.” #WorldCup
4569 2018-06-14 16:27:02 Move forward with your plan to make America energy independent. Develop new oil fields, promote natural gas creating at least a half million new jobs. Aim for it to be totally independent of any need to import energy from OPEC
4570 2018-06-14 16:26:46 Only God knows the way oil price is gonna inflate if Saudi Arabia lose this match 
4571 2018-06-14 16:26:39 do you get yours from petreleaf? i use the oil for my dog and it helps a lot. CBD oil is perfectly safe in correct dosage.
4572 2018-06-14 16:26:37 How about a spoiler alert? I *was* going to enjoy reading this Tom Clancy fan-fic. 

Btw, as a former nuc source qualified engineer in the oil field, ain't no way those things are going to make a useful dirty bomb.
4573 2018-06-14 16:26:27 Venezuela eyes first-ever refining of foreign oil...
4574 2018-06-14 16:26:22 They have oil, lots
4575 2018-06-14 16:26:20 There is to those who want to drill oil wells off our coast. A weak California is easier to overcome than a united one

4586 2018-06-14 16:25:25 Is there a class on how to independently take care of my car on my own ? No idea how to put on a tire or check the oil but I’m willing to learn
4587 2018-06-14 16:25:24 I think Canada bought a Trans Canada Route pretty cheap and no oil pipeline will be permited on the lands purchased. Wait and see inventions

4589 2018-06-14 16:25:04 The round of 16 would be filled with clashes of middle East countries who take as much pleasure(if not more) from sapping blood out of human body as they in taking oil out of their wells.
4590 2018-06-14 16:24:55 And Russia is again behind it Oh and a desire to put oil wells off our beautiful coast so we can deal with spills and more Russian mob trying to take over NO THANKS

4596 2018-06-14 16:24:42 I'm refining definition of corporate media. I doubt Pizza Hut cares what they broadcast. U named the corps that do care the most,add oil & big pharma as someone pointed out to me. If there's a "deep state," maybe that's what it is. IMO this "deep state" of corp run the gov.
4597 2018-06-14 16:24:40 Nutritional Yeast Gravy:
Toast equal parts flour + nutritional yeast (1/4c each?) in a frying pan, add a bunch of oil/butter (2-4tbsp?) and then some fake milk/water/broth, whisk that up and add soy sauce, pepper, sage- 
plus sautéed onions, mushrooms, jalapeños, whatever really
4598 2018-06-14 16:24:38 Chive oil, basil oil, rosemary oil are amazing and all won garden ingredients
4599 2018-06-14 16:24:38 There are billions of people who create demand for oil-based products, and somehow the oil companies can turn off this demand?
4600 2018-06-14 16:24:36 Oil Clasico living up to the hype
4601 2018-06-14 16:24:32 We still have some Bath bombs, and some are 50% off. There’s a coconut hair oil in the cocoa shea line as well. And we have some loofas, sponges, brushes, and a textured pad thing for scrubbies. Stop in tomorrow or Saturday and I’ll show ya 
4602 2018-06-14 16:24:30 Loooove how convenient it is now that I can walk over to the Buffalo Wild Wings drink a few beers while I wait on my 2 hour long oil change
4603 2018-06-14 16:24:27 Coconut oil>>>>>
4604 2018-06-14 16:24:17 え。笑
4605 2018-06-14 16:24:12 I massage the leaves with olive oil! That helps it not be tough. Then I cook a little garlic in olive oil, then just add it in. & I season w/a garlic seasoning & let it cook down.
4606 2018-06-14 16:24:00 I'm an oil newbie, so it's nice to see it's a ptpa winner!  k trust that seal of approval #PTPAParty

4609 2018-06-14 16:23:55 Hot sauce is not seasoning. Chili oil is though 
4610 2018-06-14 16:23:39 Like me, I know you were frustrated with his use of Puljujarvi but the more last season moved along it became more and more evident that McLellan was trying to protect the kid. If good ol' Pete doesn't move him, I'm fairly confident Todd hands him a primary role in 2018-19.
4611 2018-06-14 16:23:34 Olive oil

4615 2018-06-14 16:23:17 Love  lavender oil #PTPAParty
4616 2018-06-14 16:23:12 That's because the photographer told him to leave the baby oil at home and put his hog away
4617 2018-06-14 16:23:02 It's a good thing they drill oil better than they play football. #WorldCup
4618 2018-06-14 16:22:59 “It’s the fossil fuel derby, isn’t it?” I comment to the ultras. “One side’s got all the gas, the other side’s got all the oil!”

They seemed to like it… #RUSKSA #WorldCup

4621 2018-06-14 16:22:46 There about 200 countries in the world and many of them are not rich. Some are very rich such as oil producers and not on the 76 country list but overall SA would be in top quarter with pay of employees
4622 2018-06-14 16:22:42 IMHO Med diet is a fashion, probably promoted by olive oil producers

4629 2018-06-14 16:22:05 Love some essential oil #PTPAParty
4630 2018-06-14 16:21:50 Yeah getting better with ISIS took over cities, an open door for human trafficking, brutal clan wars for oil, yet improving to be very- ultra- hyper Democratic state nearby US.
4631 2018-06-14 16:21:45 Who is the disciple here @realDonaldTrump ? This is the moron who took foundation dollars out to pay to have an oil painted portrait of himself to hang at Ma Ra Largo resort and contribute money to AG of FL to curtail law suits against shady RE sale of property.
4632 2018-06-14 16:21:43 I've done it too; it's a lot of work, super messy, and the amount of gelatin+water that's left behind will spit/pop/smoke like crazy. So much easier/cleaner/faster to pour it through a cheesecloth lined sieve while lukewarm. The thick coconut oil will self-entrap particles.

4641 2018-06-14 16:21:18 The worst part is that it was nothing to do with oil either. It was the agony of waiting for #lufc to announce Bielsa
4642 2018-06-14 16:21:12 Oil Money in action. But Oil Money doesn't win matches in the world cup.
4643 2018-06-14 16:21:07 gasoline and other products are separated out of crude.  Refined.

Kinda like cheese and low fat milk are refined products.  Unless you have a cheese tree and a low fat goat.

U must subscribe to the oil is a mineral thing.

That would mean there is oil on the moon.  Go drill

4647 2018-06-14 16:20:57 And is he forcing the oil and gas companies to lower the prices? And even if they do for a couple of days, it will be right back up after a couple of weeks.

4650 2018-06-14 16:20:51 I presume everyone making exactly the same oil & human rights jokes about #RUSSAU will remember to make constant reference to England & Belgium’s violent colonisation of Africa when they play each other 
4651 2018-06-14 16:20:50 DUDE I JUST SAID THIS AS I WAS RUBBING OIL ON ME. MY HANDS FEEL SO GROSS.

4660 2018-06-14 16:20:01 Putin is watching #RUSKSA match with Arabian prince...

Normal people-they must be talking about football

4661 2018-06-14 16:19:57 Wondering if my coffee has spoiled me. I just tried some coffee while I’m waiting on an oil change, and I just had to throw it away.  #whatintheworldwasit
4662 2018-06-14 16:19:53 You basically said " The sun causes cancer" The old, I don't care bit. The truth is deregulation allows profit seeking polluters to go unchecked. Do you know that there are dead zones in the ocean, this administration wants to make it a big oil field

4670 2018-06-14 16:19:38 While tallying up the subsidizes given to Big Oil over the century +, don't forget the military funds spent on making the world safer for Big Oil. We have spent LIVES & $ defending corporations that have exploited other nations. Big Oil  at the barrel of a gun.

4677 2018-06-14 16:19:08 Not good? How about you get off your oil fetish and embrace alternative energy the way you do alternative facts?!
4678 2018-06-14 16:19:07 Crown Prince but sure. No hot take but basically: oil
4679 2018-06-14 16:19:07 What do the Tories really want from Scotland? Nuclear sub bases? Oil revenue? Or just the power and control aspect in Westminster? Someone please tell me...
4680 2018-06-14 16:19:05 #KSA should focus on bombing Yemen and exploring oil. Football isn't your game
4681 2018-06-14 16:19:05 Seed oil like cotton, soybeans, corn are rich in omega 6 and highly inflammatory

     "If you sit on gold, diamond, oil, manganese, uranium... and your people don't have food, are you humans?
4687 2018-06-14 16:18:42 On the way up call the gondola: 'Alberta Advantage' or 'Oil Boom' 
On the way down: 'NDP Experiment' or 'Oil Bust' or 'Getting Screwed Over by OPEC'
4688 2018-06-14 16:18:35 I still want to believe in the benefits of an entire diet, but this study seems just adding oil/nuts to a mostly healthy diet. I need a lot of RCTs to start believing that that makes sense.

4692 2018-06-14 16:18:26 I need more oil and gold!
4693 2018-06-14 16:18:22 Every time that #FifaWorldCup2018 #Russia camera swings over to King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud #KSA & #Russian pres. Vladimir Vladimirovich #Putin I can see that the middle guy (interpreter) wants to laugh on how these two are plotting to eff the #USA on #oil biz!  
4694 2018-06-14 16:18:21 A girl I went to HS with has been bragging for several years about coconut oil pulling her teeth instead of brushing them - all natural, you know? 

The amount of dental work she’s needed, including 3 root canals, in the last few months is positively comical.
4695 2018-06-14 16:18:16 omg I have to do an oil painting na charot

4697 2018-06-14 16:18:07 Nope. Not a chance. Damage done. Debt, taxation, faux feminism, faux environmentalism, divisive Marxist style identity politics, and above all the traitorous blocking of the oil sands pipelines. Alberta needs a separation option.
4698 2018-06-14 16:18:02 And now we have China offering to buy oil fr anyone for Yuan/Gold payment.
Russia receives gold fr. China for oil delivery.

Would expect some backlash/allegations against Russia & China.

4705 2018-06-14 16:17:27 Thought you said Saudia Arabia was going to increase its oil production Mr. President.
4706 2018-06-14 16:17:18 We all wish Saudi Arabia would gave away there oil like they give away the ball vs Russia #WorldCupRussia2018 #RUSSAU #itvfootball
4707 2018-06-14 16:17:15 A fun fact that I learned in Logistics this year is that there is 4 million miles of roadways; 143,000 miles of railroad; 5,286 public airports; 26,000 miles of navigable waterways; and 150,000 miles of oil pipelines. #osulogisticsmoment
4708 2018-06-14 16:17:14 Was looking for books on oil painting in a charity shop and instead I find a book on Michelangelos paintings I mean this is a fucking steal and a half yes mate
4709 2018-06-14 16:17:07 As a happy member of oil and geopolitical I'd suggest that production is ALWAYS manipulated for price support.

4712 2018-06-14 16:16:57 "Do me a favor" really?  How about "We will sanction you out of existance". Gasoline and oil is their only cash resource. With our allies  ( the ones you haven't alienated at least) we can econimically ruin them.
4713 2018-06-14 16:16:56 I wish I had space for oil painting. I miss it so much!
4714 2018-06-14 16:16:55 A3. We do a bath with a lavender essential oil and usually sing our song and then a story! #PTPAParty
4715 2018-06-14 16:16:55 Saudi Arabia should focus on improving oil production.
4716 2018-06-14 16:16:42 Oil prices DOWN!
4717 2018-06-14 16:16:42 Another fine example of not knowing what you are talking about: it is not that there isn't any more oil, there are reserves to last at least 200 - 300 years: it is that it is irresponsible to keep polluting the earth with it.
4718 2018-06-14 16:16:41 Interesting that AG Sessions spoke directly about the report and hinted that there will be more people fired. The house cleaning bigins!

4730 2018-06-14 16:15:43 The context of all the blathering is petroleum.

Petroleum (Crude) oil is absolutely natural.

Go sue Mother Nature for every Natural oil seep into the Gulf of Mexico.  Sounds like a Clean Water Act Violation: $25,000 per day per violation.  Go for it.

Moving on

4775 2018-06-14 16:12:36 Loool look at them plotting oil deals in the box
4776 2018-06-14 16:12:36 Nicole HELP. Can't decipher the differences between rosehip oil, the snail repair you recommend, or something like Glossier's Solution or COSRX Triple C. They all claim the same benefits!
4777 2018-06-14 16:12:35 That's alot of oil

4780 2018-06-14 16:12:21 A tornado, so close to home, in  Wilkes Barre. The weather/ natural disasters are getting crazy these days! Maybe, with all of the oil being drilled, earth finally decided to fight back?
#tornado #wilkesBarre
4781 2018-06-14 16:11:52 That's ok. Cut off there oil lines that come from the north. I would say don't go to Canada but who goes there anyway.
4782 2018-06-14 16:11:46 Trying to say youse doing have oil money hahaha
4783 2018-06-14 16:11:41 Didn't Xavi teach these boys anything while he chowed that oil money?
4784 2018-06-14 16:11:41 U.S. production of oil & natural gas liquids since Oct 2016 increased up to 2 million barrels per day so @OPECnews @Russia & other major #oil producers reduced their global output by 1.8 million barrels per day to #artificially #constrain #inventories to #increase #prices.
4785 2018-06-14 16:11:37 I idolize Elon like I idolize Neil Tyson and Chimamanda Adichie. Seeing him hurt is a heart breaking. The USA, especially Republicans, along with Oil companies, were always out to destroy him so this was coming.
4786 2018-06-14 16:11:30 Naar regardless of personal issues between two idiots, this is a US policy enabled by oil independency and the fall of the wall
4787 2018-06-14 16:11:28 The winner of the #RUSKSA match gets to decide the international price of oil for the next 4 years, (allegedly).

#WorldCupRussia2018
4788 2018-06-14 16:11:27 Nah, they’re crazy to think they have the copyright. They merely pieced stolen footages together, add words, add oil, add chilli, add salt, add spice to it, then release it to only paid NicoNico members. Funny. Laugh out loud.
4789 2018-06-14 16:11:18 Price movements of Oil makes me think that OPEC should more accurately be renamed as OPAQUE
4790 2018-06-14 16:11:12 Think Saudi Arabia  should stick to killing westerners and producing oil #fuckingshite

4795 2018-06-14 16:11:01 Fracture economy as told by global economist, even crude oil was brought on debt  from iran totalling 6. 5 bn dollars . Period.11.-13 was year of free loan to all congress Industralist , videocon,mallaya,nirav,choksi,bhushan steel, Essar oil, Jindal alone taken 75000cr public mny
4796 2018-06-14 16:10:59 So much Oil in Russia, defenders be sliding 
4797 2018-06-14 16:10:49 Personal experience - means I have tried cbd oil and it works for me. I don't understand the attitude when I've said nothing wrong or against anything?!
4798 2018-06-14 16:10:41 There’s plenty of oil.  The younger generation just thinks we should stop using it. So what’s the complaint.
4799 2018-06-14 16:10:40 Mark Rich was a 'go to' guy for countries under international sanctions, if you needed oil. He was best in the game and made a fortune by 'sanction-busting'...
4800 2018-06-14 16:10:40 Huh, I thought jeans and t shirts were genderless, who knew.
4801 2018-06-14 16:10:39 Out even before it was half time

4802 2018-06-14 16:10:38 #WorldCup  It's a done deal . The one who loses the match gives up his oil.

4806 2018-06-14 16:10:15 As of right now 2-0 in Russia's favor - it would appear like Saudi Arabia, and not Russia will be cutting production if oil prices go lower than desired (circa 2015) #Russia2018WorldCup #Russia2018 #Oil #clownmethod #swingproducers #OPEC
4807 2018-06-14 16:10:12 True haih but everyone says coconut oil is good for hair. Gotta find another solution

4810 2018-06-14 16:10:03 #SaudiArabia #FIFAWorldCup  Saudis defence is total shambles . They are everywhere but are missing when the counter attack to them takes place . Sheikhd gotta  oil in  some of their money into their squad instead of watering  all out on hoes and kebabs
4811 2018-06-14 16:09:56 what about oil twitter, better known as #OOTT ?
4812 2018-06-14 16:09:52 @iamsrk sir ap bata de ke ap apne baloon ko kia lagte hain mtlb konse jel cream ye oil
4813 2018-06-14 16:09:48 Except the joke makes no sense as Russia are the biggest oil producer in the world. And Saudi Arabia is the second.
4814 2018-06-14 16:09:45 Good to see the Saudis clinching their next oil deal with Russia
4815 2018-06-14 16:09:32 ...which (in my view) is an excellent reason to speak about crude oil production instead of watching.
4816 2018-06-14 16:09:32 I wonder where do the Saudi Arabian players play their Football** lol Oil League* in their home country perhaps* mcim disapointing*
4817 2018-06-14 16:09:24 Nothing like getting mansplained at the dealership when you’re just trying to get the oil changed on your vehicle. I am not some ditzy little lady that only knows how to sew and make babies, grease monkey.
4818 2018-06-14 16:09:16 Saudi Arabia losing. Oil prices going up tomorrow.
4819 2018-06-14 16:09:16 How could Venezuela afford to send 12 tons of food and supplies in aid relief to Cuba after Alberto went through?  If they're that desperate?   I see a push for a war in the Caribbean-panama canal.  Given Russia and China vs US and oil.
4820 2018-06-14 16:09:15 Pretty sure there’s some kind of oil deal in the Saudi Arabia vs Russia match. Loser gives the other team oil.
4821 2018-06-14 16:09:04 Fuck off Man City and Chelsea, Russia v Saudi Arabia is the real oil derby

4822 2018-06-14 16:08:58 Today was the 2nd time in my life that I tried Fried Green Tomatoes. Shits pretty good lol. I didn’t like em 1st time tho. Maybe the oil was fresh this time 
4823 2018-06-14 16:08:56 ไม่เอา แพง
4824 2018-06-14 16:08:52 Raps about the oil he has and shady deals with oil companies and the U.S govt. "I stood on the world stage hands on the orb with Trump oil by the barrel no need for a hand on the gun I swear to Allah a change gonna come, gonna fleece these yanks and proceed to do what they done"
4825 2018-06-14 16:08:50 You might find there is a gap between, "can't get more toxic than...," and, "would just as soon sniff this as coconut oil."
4826 2018-06-14 16:08:48 idk why bugs r so fuckin dumb bro. they continuously land on me just to be poisoned by my copious amounts of tanning oil. #rip
4827 2018-06-14 16:08:48 I’ve Learned Oil Is A Great Tool When Having Sex.
4828 2018-06-14 16:08:44 That's true oil will always be needed and I don't know how synthetic oil compares. I've read that going green is very costly and doesn't give huge profits like oil so not as many people wanting to go hard into it. Time will tell.
4829 2018-06-14 16:08:44 Owo epo. Oil money
4830 2018-06-14 16:08:40 レゲエ分からんけど踊るか
4831 2018-06-14 16:08:36 Baby just paid to get me a new tire, an oil change, & new work pants & socks...... A WHOLE REAL ASS MAN. I love him so much 
4832 2018-06-14 16:08:25 There is also online leaderboards.  An original bug that can get you extra points is you didn't need to necessarily jump over the barrel, you can jump next to it. Try it on the first barrel DK throws directly to the oil barrel. #NintendoE3
4833 2018-06-14 16:08:19 Oil change and court tomorrow 
4834 2018-06-14 16:08:18 Lol... loser has to give up it's country's oil
4835 2018-06-14 16:08:01 Many thanks to @cbdbrothers for sending me a few CBD oil samples. Should they do what I hope they will for me, consider me a valued ans repeat customer.
4836 2018-06-14 16:07:49 I hate getting an oil change so much that I just wanna buy a new car every time I need one
4837 2018-06-14 16:07:47 Presented bags of rice, oil, used clothing,  soap, cups and maps to the Chief Imam orphanage and the Muslim community at Fadama  this afternoon as we celebrate the Eid tomorrow. Happy Eid
4838 2018-06-14 16:07:44 No matter who loses the opening match, the #oil price will only go up. Something's gotta give.
4839 2018-06-14 16:07:42 ECONOMIC INDICATORS: 14 June @ 18:00

4840 2018-06-14 16:07:38 Lol ima make you sign a disclaimer cuz i dont want none of your cousins tryna chase me out the N.O after i lay my critique down . Niggas jump me im the corner by the all purpose flour and olive oil  i cant have all that. I gotta beef up my security before i come see you
4841 2018-06-14 16:07:37 This Saudi players are just throwing away their chances of owning oil blocks. Crown prince is watching you're playing nonsense
4842 2018-06-14 16:07:32 Nice now I can fully role-playing and yell a lot about not having oil as Germany.
4843 2018-06-14 16:07:25 Tip of the day: ask for coconut oil in your acai. You’re welcome 
4844 2018-06-14 16:07:24 Koi nahi, they have so much oil reserves 
4845 2018-06-14 16:07:19 They said my oil change will take an hour and 15 min... I work at 1 in WDM. 
...... how tf does it take that long to change oil
4846 2018-06-14 16:07:16 Nooooooo whatever you do do not use cooking oil
4847 2018-06-14 16:07:15 หุ่นสวยมากๆคับ
4848 2018-06-14 16:07:12 I wonder if they would turn someone away wearing a military uniform.  I mean, that's a political statement in an all volunteer force, isn't it?
4849 2018-06-14 16:07:08 Pisses me off when restaurants advertise food as vegetarian and then write in the small print that vegetarian options aren’t always cooked in separate oil. If it’s cooked in the same oil as meat products, then it’s not fucking vegetarian is it
4850 2018-06-14 16:07:05 its harsh but its a harsh business that we love on more important things dani pedrosa has everyone snake oil about retiring and they bought it
4851 2018-06-14 16:07:04 เท่าที่เราเคยอ่านผ่านๆนะคะ คนที่ชิปหมอเมะ จะชอบหมอจะหื่นๆกันมากกกก ตอนแรกๆที่เราเข้าด้อมเราก็ชอบหมอหื่นๆเพราะไปอ่านโดลอว์ลูมา555 แต่พอดูมาถึงเดรสโรซ่าก็เริ่มใจบาป เวลาที่ป๋าเรียกชื่อลอว์มันอดจิ้นไม่ได้จริงๆค่ะ แล้วหมอก็ดูยั่วๆเมียๆเราเลยใจแตกหลงหมอเคะค่ะ ;///;
4852 2018-06-14 16:07:04 This Saudi side is wank, pass me some fucking crude oil #RUSKSA
4853 2018-06-14 16:07:03 “Where would we be without the oil money?”
4854 2018-06-14 16:06:59 Though they don't exactly turn heads on the football pitch, both Saudi Arabia and Russia are extremely wealthy oil oligarchs, making up over a quarter of total global crude oil export. #BehindTheFootball
4855 2018-06-14 16:06:57 Checkers OIL 
4856 2018-06-14 16:06:54 I just did it.  It does form a raft.  Difference is you have to unmold the solidified oil (like a frozen dessert-dip in hot water) and then scrap off the gelatinized layer of debris with a knife.
4857 2018-06-14 16:06:53 Last night I checked the coolant level and oil in my car while Matt did the dishes. “We’re so 2018 babe!” #destroygenderroles
4858 2018-06-14 16:06:47 So would you rather sniff pentanes or coconut oil?
4859 2018-06-14 16:06:45 These ones think it’s oil that they came  to sell in Russia  #WorldCupRussia2018
4860 2018-06-14 16:06:44 which do u prefer this time peanut butter or baby oil??
4861 2018-06-14 16:06:42 I'm sure there is a microbe that canake synthetic oil.
4862 2018-06-14 16:06:33 hahahaha battle for the oil reserve??? 
4863 2018-06-14 16:06:32 "Now, you put the onion onto the lightly heated oil and let it simmer for a while"
4864 2018-06-14 16:06:31 Not ad long as they could keep their oil leases and royalties.
4865 2018-06-14 16:06:30 US, Saudi, Russia, Canada, and hmm, China? Those oil fields in the SCS are pretty big, right?
4866 2018-06-14 16:06:25 Anything except the Love of Lord Jesus can be a cult. Oil lobby is cult. Science geeks can be cult. Washington and Ottawa are cult like. What about beer guzzling commuters in Ontario: they are complacent provincially minded, ignoramouses with heads stuck in sand: a cult.
Repent!X
4867 2018-06-14 16:06:24 Play again today?
4868 2018-06-14 16:06:19 脳裏に浮かぶ波田陽区
4869 2018-06-14 16:06:07 WHEN THERE IS NO FRESH WATER TO DRINK THEN WHAT? Not enough water in Canada to get at all the OIL out of Tar Sands
4870 2018-06-14 16:05:50 The oil soaking into the meats... delicious.
4871 2018-06-14 16:05:47 It's kinda nonsense though. Like Tesla or anything else in the US, it's a business that lives off of recycled mercantalist/petro dollars. They don't make money. Elon Musk shoots dollars into the sky. Shale oil pumps them into the ground.
4872 2018-06-14 16:05:41 i’ve been scrubbing with a loofah to the point my skin is raw. i’m gonna try baby oil and if that doesn’t work i’ll try the polish remover thanks!!!
4873 2018-06-14 16:05:38 The sad thing, we live in BC, we get oil from Alberta, but we pay premium for gas here because most of the fuel we have in BC actually comes from Washington state. It's ridiculous.
4874 2018-06-14 16:05:26 Saudi should just stick to their oil business and leave football for good...
4875 2018-06-14 16:05:22 Well, it's at least better than the expected dead rubber 0-0! Russia taking the battle from the oil field to the football field quite seriously! 

Goals in the opening game are a good sign! Let's hope it's goal galore at @FIFAWorldCup
#Rusia2018 #RUSKSA #WorldCup
4876 2018-06-14 16:05:19 @RussiaOG #1 oil producer worldwide 

#shaleoil #enabled @UnitedStates to #overtake @Saudi Arabia in 2017 to become #2 oil producer
4877 2018-06-14 16:05:15 Imagine being girl trying to buy a car or get an oil change. Lmao they try to finess you to the max.
4878 2018-06-14 16:05:09 Y'all not watching this Oil money exhibition World Cup game?
4879 2018-06-14 16:05:08 PLUS the fact there is more oil than ever...
But why have facts, anyway...
4880 2018-06-14 16:05:04 No where near the subsides and tax breaks oil gets...and you know it.
4881 2018-06-14 16:05:04 Weak reporting from @ZaltzCricket, he should go back to real journalism like working out the distance in frozen oil cricket bats between US cities
4882 2018-06-14 16:04:48 Saudi coming to show what they made of in the second half...Oil money here they come
4883 2018-06-14 16:04:37 It’s not OPEC. It’s greedy US oil oligarchs.  Middle class can’t afford gas for their commute to work.
4884 2018-06-14 16:04:20 Our heating oil price is at $2.899 per gallon!
4885 2018-06-14 16:04:19 Saudi Arabia losing. Oil prices going up tomorrow.
4886 2018-06-14 16:04:16 I have exfoliators at home but I prefer the natural stuff, vitamin e oil & brown sugar sounds good
4887 2018-06-14 16:04:10 The of oil isn't the problem
When Carter deregulated the Gas Companies, oil was over $100 and gas was under $2.00 a gallon
In 08 it peaked at $147 & gas was $4.11
Oil is currently under $ 51 and gas is close to $ 3.00
1/3 of $ 4.11 = $1.37
4888 2018-06-14 16:04:08 So I got my upper lip waxed. The lady put the oil stuff on me and while she was plucking, her finger kept sliding into my mouth. I couldn’t help but laugh and she laughed so I guess it wasn’t that awkward... lol. Idk how to feel 
4889 2018-06-14 16:04:07 *GOVT HIKE IMPORT DUTY ON EDIBLE OIL. 35% ON CRUDE & 45% ON Refined*
4890 2018-06-14 16:04:02 Same thing that funds yours, oil and gas, whisky,  fish,  gin (all Scottish) the question should be how are you going to fund yours after we leave
4891 2018-06-14 16:04:01 UK said similar to Malta before they were indy. They developed their tourism and they're fine.
We have fishing, agriculture, renewable energies, oil, water, whisky, gin, tourism, a healthy gaming industry, 
 a strong record in innovation.....on and on it goes

We're no daft....
4892 2018-06-14 16:03:58 Ivan Glasenberg(current CEO of Glencor) was mentored by Mark Rich. Through this, Mark Rich literally ran govts that needed oil but had no money/under sanctions...
4893 2018-06-14 16:03:49 They always tryna sell me extra shit when I get my oil changes. Nah sis. Do what I came for. I got shit to do
4894 2018-06-14 16:03:48 それはもえたんや他の人の那智ですから（震え声　那智はあくまでかっこいい武人ですから……悪酔いなんてしませんから……（震えつつ
4895 2018-06-14 16:03:43 Currently at the beach eavesdropping on the teenage girls behind me and this is what I hear:
“Do you have any sunscreen?”
“Do you want tanning oil instead?”

And then another convo:
“How to get a tight butt???”
“Maybe botox!”
4896 2018-06-14 16:03:37 Being from Texas, you'd be familiar with the production of NGLs, the pentanes of which are used as diluent for oil sands bitumen.
4897 2018-06-14 16:03:28 Let me go get this oil change before my car blow up
4898 2018-06-14 16:03:28 Dropped off truck for oil change, the service reps Granpa is a retired FF from my dept. He had only good things to say about FF's and my dept. Best job in the world, too bad some don't treat it that way.
4899 2018-06-14 16:03:17 CBD oil works but just like with all natural choices we reach a plateau...honestly sometime good old fashion RICE works Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevate I know for hands ( and Broken Scaphoids ) this seems ridiculous but it does work even on hot days :)

4902 2018-06-14 16:03:07 Saudi Arabia Fuseg** Go back 2 yourl oil Rich Country u don't deserve 2 b in Russia*Ayyy man
4903 2018-06-14 16:02:50 Loooooool so many people who genetically have good skin always want to give out skincare routines which are shite because the “secret” to their good skin is genetics not some miracle oil
4904 2018-06-14 16:02:48 I should really just change my own car oil... But it's hot outside.
4905 2018-06-14 16:02:46 Little Andy will not touch the oil industry.
4906 2018-06-14 16:02:37 This oil derby is too one sided and boring #RUSSAU
4907 2018-06-14 16:02:36 Should’ve made baby wake up. I don’t wanna go get this oil change 
4908 2018-06-14 16:02:27 These legs need to be boiled in engine oil first for them to come back to life
4909 2018-06-14 16:02:26 Get the oil first
4910 2018-06-14 16:02:25 Really? You reply like a twitter bot? Google is your friend. It’s not coconut oil. It has to be able to dissolve tar!
4911 2018-06-14 16:02:23 Soldiers don’t die for your freedom, they die to prevent other countries from exchanging oil for any other fiat currency or commodity.

All the countries we invaded stopped trading oil for USD shortly before we invaded...

Our military does NOT defend our freedom. /1
4912 2018-06-14 16:02:22 When your presidents have a bet on what oil deal is on the line win or lose lol #FifaWorldCup2018
4913 2018-06-14 16:02:21 I m with u on increase but do that covertly.  Trump has already tweeted about high prices . So expect a fall again in crude (last time 4-5 USD) 
So ask Oil companies not to pass fully Nd pay higher dividend
4914 2018-06-14 16:02:14 My face routine today was lit. Exfoliated, cleansed, face mask with Turmeric, honey, baking soda, coconut oil and cinnamon. Witch hazel toner, moisturiser and vitamin E oil on the lips.

I glowing y'all.
4915 2018-06-14 16:02:14 An oil pirate that held Libya to ransom for 2 years, causing an estimated loss of 120bn dollars attacking oil crescent again is a positive? Ok! 

1. Derna is over. It’s done. It won’t alleviate bugger all

2. After every attack on the oil crescent there’s been significant damage
4916 2018-06-14 16:02:12 Who got some oil?

4919 2018-06-14 16:01:48 Matlab ke, given how enthusiastic their football commentary usually is I’d have thought Saudi Arabia would at least know how to ... well do something. Challo, at least no one cheers on Messi like they do! Also, there seems to be a new oil deal in the works #WorldCup
4920 2018-06-14 16:01:47 I am not sure they really care about the football. An oil deal clearly finalised.
4921 2018-06-14 16:01:42 Learned what WD-40 is made of and how I think it works.
It's mineral oil with cationic amines that strongly adhere to surfaces to displace water. Three+ solvents, and in air forms an oil the precursor to nylon. Use on metals, not plastics or rubber.
4922 2018-06-14 16:01:41 You know this is all an oil ploy, guys
4923 2018-06-14 16:01:40 Why am I watching this match? I’d rather see these two fix the global oil price!

4925 2018-06-14 16:01:36 Yet @realDonaldTrump pulls the US out of  Paris accord and Scott Pruitt is in bed with big oil and energy and tariffs have drastically reduced solar.  Bravo Republicans.  Can't wait for Mar-o-Largo to be under water in 50 years.
4926 2018-06-14 16:01:36 Just sat down for the Oil Autocracy Bowl between Saudi & Russia, in time to see MBS shaking Putin's hand after conceding a goal -- very Munich 1936 vibe about the whole thing.

Still, not like anyone is trying to host the world's largest sporting event in Qatar.

4936 2018-06-14 16:00:42 He would order oil from Russia and set the destination to Meditterenian country. Once the oil tanker gets there, the destinational would be changed to South Africa..And he charged the Apartheid govt billions for doing this for them. It reads like a movie..

4946 2018-06-14 15:59:43 I don’t believe a single warlord can be a stabilising force - an actual Libyan army can be a stabilising force - but the nature of the LNA, it’s crimes, tribal foundations and inability to defend the oil crescent shows it’s got a long way to go to being a real national army>
4947 2018-06-14 15:59:42 Since I celebrated Russia's first goal, dad told me to support Saudi Arabia cause they're asians..i said

4956 2018-06-14 15:58:56 Just feel like putin orchestrated an oil deal with Saudi Arabia so they could throw the match. I expected Russia to win but it looks a bit too easy.
4957 2018-06-14 15:58:56 The world was headed for recession in 2016

Oil was tanking, China was slowing, global manufacturing wilted, EM battered, US hiring was slowing. 

Then we had the greatest central bank liquidity injection we’ve ever seen, $1T in Chinese fiscal stimulus then a huge US tax cut.

- I love that the captain of Saudi Arabia is named Osama (…if only Fox News was aware of this…)

4993 2018-06-14 15:56:31 No, by 2030. Starting in 2020, EU member states will no longer have to meet minimum percentages of their renewable energy targets using food-based biofuels (palm oil, corn, soy), and additional restriction will be put on these biofuels over time.

5061 2018-06-14 15:53:04 As a Canadian, while I too would pick Trudeau over Trump, Trudeau's not as shiny as his PR people would have you believe. His shitting on the Indigenous people of Canada by buying a an oil pipeline while many reserves still have no safe water is only one of many examples.
5062 2018-06-14 15:52:58 Oily naw ain’t never heard that one...n oil seperates in water so that would be visible
5063 2018-06-14 15:52:55 Russia are rising  !!! Russia for Sam, Saudi Arabia for oil, wealth and opulence etc.
5064 2018-06-14 15:52:54 Cheryshev sent back the Saudi defenders to when Saudi Arabia had not yet discovered oil
5065 2018-06-14 15:52:44 Closing prices: #Ftse100 0.81% #DAX 1.68% #CAC 1.39% #Estoxx50 1.52% #GBPUSD 1.3329 #EURGBP 0.8729 #GILTBUND 0.0 #Gold 0.57% #Oil -0.30%
5066 2018-06-14 15:52:43  $1 billion at one location.  The entire state of Nevada sports books accepted $4.87 billion(record) in 2017.  Net revenue to the “house” was $248 million(record).  So good luck to that race track in NJ and their $1 billion goal.  Snake oil
5067 2018-06-14 15:52:38 Need to go get my oil changed.
5068 2018-06-14 15:52:34 they dserve it. Let em go back to drill oil #WorldCupRussia2018

Wow, I feel weird
5071 2018-06-14 15:52:31 Halt-time: Looks like the oil bet is going in favour of Putin.
5072 2018-06-14 15:52:31 @RealJeffHoliday Have you considered doing a video on bulletproof coffee? Every one of my coworkers is on the kick and adding the "Brain Octane." It is so expensive, popular, and is nothing but snake oil.

So amazing for my hair
5074 2018-06-14 15:52:24 Heat, air and water may facilitate avenues. Commodities We are duely bless with.  A less dependence on oil will impact economy.
5075 2018-06-14 15:52:21 อืมม เรามองว่ามันคือความบังเอิญไม่ได้ชอบการเชื่อมโยงอะไรขนาดนั้น 
5076 2018-06-14 15:52:11 Price of oil just went up 20p #WorldCup

We are ( running ) ( short ) ( of ) oil.
5079 2018-06-14 15:52:09 big wok full of oil sasha getting the temperature right is just a trial and error thing tbh but when they puff up it is glorious tbh
5080 2018-06-14 15:52:08 To be fair, the discussion is not one of Alberta not supporting equalization, it’s about the functioning of confederation. No province should be able to hold another hostage. PQ has unfettered access to oil imports bc of geography. Alberta is asking for same access for export.
5081 2018-06-14 15:52:07 Might be crude analysis but a slick start from Russia has shown there’s a gulf in class between the two teams #oil #Worldcup2018Russia #RUSvsSAU
5082 2018-06-14 15:52:05 pommes anna! I love the chive oil addition...
5083 2018-06-14 15:52:04 I'll await your motorized scooter in the motor oil section.

5085 2018-06-14 15:52:03 Well not exactly the most blistering start to a #WorldCup, but #Russia go into the break 2-0 up.

Any road back for #SaudiArabia in the Oil Baron Derby?
5086 2018-06-14 15:51:49 OTV : Be Sure That Key is not Inside the Pocket of CM NaveenP. Govt. Will Take Action Against those Who involved in it. It is not wise to ask such a cheap Question "Where is Key ? to CM. Dhramendra Pradhan Should talk First..About the Oil Price Rise..When it is Going to be Down.
5087 2018-06-14 15:51:46 Saudi should stick to what they're good at... Oil
5088 2018-06-14 15:51:38 Oil Firm Derby
5089 2018-06-14 15:51:37 She needs to go on a #WFPB, low/no salt/oil/sugar diet (and where did she get the idea that she needs so much protein? Oh, that’s right - her dietitian apparently didn’t read what Dr. Campbell wrote in “The China Study,” &/or “Whole,” about how the protein standard came about.)
5090 2018-06-14 15:51:36 Coconut oil doesnt work too i guess 
5091 2018-06-14 15:51:30 Oil money will not save Saudi. #WorldCup2018
5092 2018-06-14 15:51:27 Yes but little do you know that if Russia win Saudi Arabia are cutting off the oil supply to their country so really they don't want to be screaming and shouting
5093 2018-06-14 15:51:24 GOAL! Russia 2-0 KSA

Fact 2 on Russia-Saudi relations:  In 2016, Russia & Saudi Arabia cooperation to cut oil production to stabilize oil prices was the first time since 2001 that OPEC agreed on output goals.  #RUSKSA #worldcup
5094 2018-06-14 15:51:21  so can this really be an event to twist oil market? Say if Russia beat Saudia 8 - 0 will Sauidia get angry and pump oil angrily ????? lol
5095 2018-06-14 15:51:20 Hey don’t talk about our oil provider that way 
5096 2018-06-14 15:51:14 My half time analysis : the white oil merchants are less shitty than the brown oil merchants
5097 2018-06-14 15:51:13 I wonder how many million barrels of oil were bet on this Russia - Saudi Arabia match between billionaire buddies 
#RUSvKSA
5098 2018-06-14 15:51:05 Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia’s probably drowning them in oil rn
5099 2018-06-14 15:51:02 Oil?
5100 2018-06-14 15:50:59 Saudi Arabia are only good at producing oil 
5101 2018-06-14 15:50:56 Then again, Oil money vs Oil money 
5102 2018-06-14 15:50:55 It was a deal, whoever concedes first had to give up all their oil.
5103 2018-06-14 15:50:53 Does the winner get to boost oil supply? 
#WorldCup #russiaVssaudiarabia #RussiavsSaudi
5104 2018-06-14 15:50:48 But why is this coming after oil was discovered, looks like the government is turning away people from thinking of money to come from their oil
5105 2018-06-14 15:50:44 I dont have one set too.Cleanser hada labo.Toner make me prem,essence skii&primera, facial oil safflower biolife, eye cream simple. mix & match gitu. i cuci muka mlm je. clay mask 1x seminggu. exfolition mandelic acid from wishtrend.

5107 2018-06-14 15:50:42 ..have any of you been to Indonesia or Malaysia?...flown over the once forest paradise of #Borneo...or driven the highways that are now flanked by mile upon mile of oil palm?...

5110 2018-06-14 15:50:40 How much oil does it take to power a phone? Better yet, 30 years ago how much mpg could your cars get? Bitter millennial he may be, but you're a jaded fool Kirk.
5111 2018-06-14 15:50:40 The money through hikes goes to the refiners. Not to the oil marketing company's. Interesting.

Promise this cake has oil this time lol
5114 2018-06-14 15:50:34 Listen honey. As long as you have olive oil garlic and onions/shallots you can make anything savory in your kitchen pop.
5115 2018-06-14 15:50:34 When Saudi loses, does Putin get to nick the country’s oil rights?
5116 2018-06-14 15:50:26 No matter who loses, oil wins
5117 2018-06-14 15:50:25 No sign of shortfall in oil investments, BP CFO Gilvary says
5118 2018-06-14 15:50:23 @1a Joshua, please don't fall for oil and gas lies.  @NatResources GOP members are attempting to change laws which protect our #publiclands to the benefit of oil/gas donors.  All they care about is short term financial gain.
5119 2018-06-14 15:50:12 What you suppose to do ? People are elected you as the President of the USA , it's your job. To find the solution to lower the price oil and gasoline .
5120 2018-06-14 15:50:11 & they won't because there is too much profits for them involved #gas #oil... profits before peace = #Rothschild's.
5121 2018-06-14 15:50:05 My hands are too!

5122 2018-06-14 15:50:03 Putin shakes hands with Saudi Crown Prince after Russia scores the first goal of WC 2018 ..... English commentator says "they are doing an oil deal. It has nothing to do with football. You will know about it at the pump on Saturday"  #WorldCupRussia2018
5123 2018-06-14 15:50:02 I've been using dove hand soap as face wash and honestly it's vvv good at getting rid of oil and spots
5124 2018-06-14 15:50:00 This dude really just tried to finesse me when all I came here for was an oil change
5125 2018-06-14 15:49:49 Saudi Arabia has to give up their oil now to Russia
5126 2018-06-14 15:49:48 Saudi Arabia dem dey play like say dey force dem kon play world cup, anyhow sha dey still get their oil money so e no go too move them
5127 2018-06-14 15:49:45 So many are saying it — even people who don’t want to say it — they have to admit it. The best, greatest snake oil salesman of all time.
5128 2018-06-14 15:49:43 Its Goloving all over Oil merchants.
5129 2018-06-14 15:49:41 Totoane duit biasa, iki ketoke totoane kilang minyak opo crude oil
5130 2018-06-14 15:49:37 dry oil is the best thing ever
5131 2018-06-14 15:49:37 Saudia should focus on oil..
Worldcup tumlogo ki bas ki baat nahi 
5132 2018-06-14 15:49:30 Saudi Arabia are not really there for the world cup, they are there to sign OIL deals with other countries
5133 2018-06-14 15:49:28 RT Trader Joe’s stuff. I use Dickinson’s witch hazel & s/t rose water to tone. Still trying to figure out a good SPF, oil control moisturizer & trying out serums. Been using OZ naturals vitamin C & hyaluronic + The Body Shop Tea Tree line for a while. Next: The Ordinary serums
5134 2018-06-14 15:49:25 The City of Chicago has been bamboozled again by anther snake oil salesman.
5135 2018-06-14 15:49:23 Saudi Arabia should stick to exporting Oil. Football isn't their thing #WorldCupRussia2018
5136 2018-06-14 15:49:16 oil money can buy american politicians but it can't buy a decent defensive back line.

5139 2018-06-14 15:49:11 Oil laaa
5140 2018-06-14 15:49:10 all that oil money and neither of these countries could use it to scout for fresh blood or train their players well.......
5141 2018-06-14 15:49:09 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
5142 2018-06-14 15:49:09 3/I don't believe a single drop of oil will be kept from the market by protest or studies or conferences. I'm not even convinced govts will follow through w/threats to ban ICE vehicles. But that at least, IMO, makes more sense than targeting oil supply.
5143 2018-06-14 15:49:05 US soldiers go to war for oil and loot  kill innocent young and old call them murderers not heroes.
5144 2018-06-14 15:49:05 Don't be distracted that this was the only way Saudi could broker that oil deal with Russia. Lose to Rus and get that oil money 
5145 2018-06-14 15:49:04 Was Rory out drinking oil with this Saudi back four last night?
5146 2018-06-14 15:49:03 My president @POTUS , we need prices up to sustain jobs in the sector. Any attempt to lower prices will lead to mass layoffs. And that won't be good for all of us, both OPEC & American oil companies. My thought!
5147 2018-06-14 15:49:03 Amazing how many computer issues are resolved by updating

5154 2018-06-14 15:48:43 So much oil in Russia that defenders are just sliding
5155 2018-06-14 15:48:42 Saudi Arabia should stick to selling oil and Goat Shawarmas. Football isn't for them.
5156 2018-06-14 15:48:37 Any more goal will take WTI crude oil to 100 dollars per barrel :(

5159 2018-06-14 15:48:23 It's Putin's way of telling Saudi Arabia: 'stick your oil barrels up there, I'm greater than you' (imagine with a Russian accent)
5160 2018-06-14 15:48:18 KSA is leakier than an crude oil pipe line
5161 2018-06-14 15:48:16 Dey are known for oil money not football is understandable lol
5162 2018-06-14 15:48:12 This oil derby is proving itself a very watchable game regardless of rankings. The World Cup never disappoints.

5170 2018-06-14 15:47:45 Are u sure they didn’t use oil money to qualify
5171 2018-06-14 15:47:42 Saudi should stick to selling oil poor guy got sent for a halal hotdog
5172 2018-06-14 15:47:38 If #rus floods #ksa with goals, maybe the Saudis will respond by flooding the market with oil barrels.
5173 2018-06-14 15:47:36 2/I expect EVs to begin seriously displacing oil between 2040 and 2050, and to have 80% or more of the market between 2070 and 2080. That timeline could be longer (legacy tech can be stubborn) or shorter if 1 or all of 4 tech disruptions take place.

5181 2018-06-14 15:47:19 Not got any better during the game either! The first goal became a very, very unfunny comment about an oil deal... Shows the lack of talent within the team already
5182 2018-06-14 15:47:13 Golovin will make these Saudi players leak oil from their asses in the 2nd half
5183 2018-06-14 15:47:13 Oil wealth, nothing else.

5187 2018-06-14 15:47:10 Haha the two Saudi Arabian defenders sent to dig oil
5188 2018-06-14 15:47:07 I've never heard so many opposite views about oil. I have no idea what the truth is.
5189 2018-06-14 15:47:04 I went to bed around 2 am but I swear I’m so awake today and my face looks flawless, I deep conditioned it with a coconut oil mask overnight and it was like the equivalent to an extra 3 hours

5194 2018-06-14 15:46:53 Russia need to be careful here. Saudi could turn on the oil taps if it gets to three nil. #WorldCupRussia2018 #RUSKSA

5196 2018-06-14 15:46:41 Or they just agreed on some mega oil deal.

5208 2018-06-14 15:46:18 Arabs are the winners here. Probably billionaires by end of their careers as being futbal+oil merchants. Golovin will be selling Vodka in the slums of Moscow by the age of 28. Look at Arshavin.
5209 2018-06-14 15:46:16 My hands smell like toasted sesame oil. I ain't mad. Mmmm.
5210 2018-06-14 15:46:15 Where can i bet on Saudi to get 0 points in this tournament....they definitely used their oil money to bride there way into this, coz there is no way they got here based on skill
5211 2018-06-14 15:46:14 Why? With all of the oil, mineral, and precious metals in America, why are we getting them from Canada? Using clean technology, this country could have full employment for skilled and unskilled workers.
5212 2018-06-14 15:46:12 Man got sent to his Oil shop

5220 2018-06-14 15:45:58 How much was spent to purchase the OIL PAINTS whose Poisonous Smell has taken over Benin, Courtesy of the MOU Governor Obaseki?
5221 2018-06-14 15:45:58 Russia beating Saudi Arabia like they owe them oil money
5222 2018-06-14 15:45:58 จบด้วยดี กับปัญหาทุกอย่าง ก็แค่แยกทางตามหาความสุขของตัวเอง
5223 2018-06-14 15:45:57 Turns into a bottle of date oil
5224 2018-06-14 15:45:57 very sad. Why cease fire. Fry terrorists in frying oil. Stop vote bank politics. Either BJP or congress why tying hands of armed forces. Please don't this it will spoil whole system.
5225 2018-06-14 15:45:54 Cherysev selling the Saudi’s like they sell us oil!! #chop

5228 2018-06-14 15:45:52 That 2 Saudis went diving for oil  #RUS #worldcup
5229 2018-06-14 15:45:51 Oops been driving with no oil in my car 
5230 2018-06-14 15:45:48 I've genuinely not noticed that at all, other than the oil snark which was mild banter really.
5231 2018-06-14 15:45:45 Stick tae punting oil Saudi
5232 2018-06-14 15:45:43 These Saudi Arabia are useless! And these are the chaps that supply us crude oil ka?
5233 2018-06-14 15:45:42 I don't care either way.I think some Oiler fans get in a tizzy when he spit balls a Oiler trade (one that is bad for the Oil).I'm sure they'd be estatic if he spit balled a 6th rd pick for Erik Karlsson; )
5234 2018-06-14 15:45:35 Saudis playing like a bunch of oil well labourers
5235 2018-06-14 15:45:35 LOOOOL HE SENT THOSE SAUDIS BACK TO THE OIL FIELDS #RUSvsSAU #WORLDCUP2018
5236 2018-06-14 15:45:34 These Saudi players be some oil Refinery workers
5237 2018-06-14 15:45:33 Being oil rich doesn't always win you trophies #RUSKSA
5238 2018-06-14 15:45:33 Wolololo..

We have been cornered. After this humiliation we shall increase the price of oil.

#WorldCup
5239 2018-06-14 15:45:33 Saudi defenders slipping in all that oil
5240 2018-06-14 15:45:32 Hey #SaudiArabia ... got an idea to get revenge for this match, flood the market with cheap oil... #LowerMyPrice #WorldCup #Russia2018 #RUS #KSA
5241 2018-06-14 15:45:30 Saudi Arabia, Go and fuck in your oil 
Russia has been dominating from the beginning.
#WorldCup
5242 2018-06-14 15:45:30 Saudi Arabia thinks it’s oil we’re refining here lmfao
5243 2018-06-14 15:45:29 low ranked football teams in the world cup tournament but Top oil producing countries.
5244 2018-06-14 15:45:29 Russian oil money now showing results eh?
5245 2018-06-14 15:45:28 Reads like someone is too irrational to separate fact from feelz.

You actually said 'oil',  as we can all read. I changed it to petroleum to cover more. Oil is kinda myopic. 

I think u know nothing but HS science based on your tweets. Not to be mean. It's just rudimentary.
5246 2018-06-14 15:45:26 It's 2-0 #RUS
So Russia Gets all the Oil! #WorldCup #RUSKSA
5247 2018-06-14 15:45:24 Russia have done absolutely fuck all yet they're 2-0 up

Saudi need to leave football alone and go back to producing oil, Asians are literally pure shit at football
5248 2018-06-14 15:45:20 David Bailey of the oil world get ready

5250 2018-06-14 15:45:18 Does the loser of this match have to cut oil production? #russiaVssaudiarabia
5251 2018-06-14 15:45:17 Why Asfandyar & Zardari Opposed #KalaBaghDam ?
Asfandyar Is A RAW's Agent So He'll Always Do This. While Zardari Have His Commission In  Billions Of $ In Oil Imports. Dr Asim As head Of PSO Made His Fortune of $billion In PSO Oil Imports .

5258 2018-06-14 15:45:03 That handshake was over an oil deal 
5259 2018-06-14 15:44:59 touch the oil
5260 2018-06-14 15:44:54 I certainly don't have to worry about it lol. But my kids might. How hard will the oil people fight to keep new technology out like solar panels? I've heard a lot of stories about that. Isn't the goal to go green for global warming? $$ always wins.

5264 2018-06-14 15:44:46 that saudi oil money can’t develop decent players 
5265 2018-06-14 15:44:44 I don’t tried it all... melatonin, lavender oil on my pillows, the only thing that has the best effect is weed 
5266 2018-06-14 15:44:41 This is not a big deal to our federal govt.  We have suffered pipe lines blocked Keystone, Energy East, an oil price collapse, increased taxes, regulation, now Trump cuts taxes and regs. but threaten manuf. jobs in the East...they are on it right now! @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer

5272 2018-06-14 15:44:15 Before you chop pepper, rub your hands and finger tips in salt or oil. It will prevent the pepper from burning/stinging our hands.
Before you chop an onion, put it in the microwave for 30 seconds only. It will sting your eyes less.
5273 2018-06-14 15:44:15 Office me hi moot lo

5280 2018-06-14 15:43:52 Panelist: Our environment is being destroyed!

Oil Exec: What about our profit margins?

Joshua Johnson: Hmmm...fair points all around
5281 2018-06-14 15:43:47 Avoid cooking though. Oil burns like hell.
5282 2018-06-14 15:43:45 Yeah man. They got plenty of oil
5283 2018-06-14 15:43:45 Allow more drilling in the US and off our coasts. OPEC controls prices by controlling how much oil is on the market. Tell OPEC to pack sand, let’s use our own oil.
5284 2018-06-14 15:43:45 Oil 1-0 Oil...#WorldCup
5285 2018-06-14 15:43:39 Their ecology is utterly fascinating. The oil beetle larvae hitch a ride on solitary bees back to their nest, and then feed on the bee's food stores and eggs.
5286 2018-06-14 15:43:30 Oil money
5287 2018-06-14 15:43:29 10. Difficult to see how Jadran can sustain control of terminals given lack logistic support from West #Libya, anti-Jadran sentiments in Misrata & PC condemnation and NOC hostility. Although LNA is stretched given war in Derna, it is likely to retake oil crescent.
5288 2018-06-14 15:43:28 Di gosok aja terus pake baby oil tar rontok sekepala-kepala deh
5289 2018-06-14 15:43:17 Uhhh for illegally using a fraud charity as his personal slush fund. 

This has been known for a long time now.

5294 2018-06-14 15:43:06 Saudi Arabia  taken the oil
5295 2018-06-14 15:42:51 And don’t put on tea tree oil right when you go out in the sun cause it makes your skin sensitive UV rays & can cause irritation
5296 2018-06-14 15:42:50 #USDCAD blowing through 1.3000 resistance as crude oil trades back below the 66.80s, a level it broke above earlier.  Next resistance 1.3075.  $CAD
5297 2018-06-14 15:42:49 Absolutely and millions of barrels of oil.
That should make everyone happy.
5298 2018-06-14 15:42:47 This place take forever for an oil change & im hungryy af
5299 2018-06-14 15:42:46 @c_hanson15 “I want Saudi Arabia to win the first game of the World Cup because they give us our oil.”

Me “ I want Russia to win the first game of the World Cup because they gave us our President.”
5300 2018-06-14 15:42:46 While dissecting the oil data, seen this AcheDin data point:

ONGC profit in 2013-14 was ₹22095 crores reduced to ₹17900 crores in 2016-17, yep, 23% decrease!

While Reliance profit grown from ₹22493 crores in 2013-14 increased to ₹31425 crores in 2016-17, ie, 40% increase!!
5301 2018-06-14 15:42:45 These oil merchants have nothing to do with football!! Smh

5304 2018-06-14 15:42:36 Two largest crude oil producers facing each other.
5305 2018-06-14 15:42:35 A con artist/snake oil salesmen-esque bard that convinces everyone that he is a cleric blessed by the God's to heal the sick..at a price of course. God's love isn't cheap
5306 2018-06-14 15:42:33 Uhh... This is, like, an oil field, right? Should we really be tossing explosives around?
5307 2018-06-14 15:42:31 @Townofnagshead Mayor Benjamin Cahoon (R-Nags Head-NC) testifies before Congress against legislation that would penalize states for protecting their coast from dirty & dangerous oil drilling #ProtectOurCoast
5308 2018-06-14 15:42:20 Saudi Arabia giving the ball away like free oil. #WorldCup
5309 2018-06-14 15:42:19 I dislike waiting while getting an oil change take to long
5310 2018-06-14 15:42:17 My oil pipelines bigger than yours
5311 2018-06-14 15:42:11 I don’t have the original bottle because I found a bigger bottle that was less expensive. And no you let those dry. You gotta let the witch hazel dry & then put on the tea tree oil
5312 2018-06-14 15:42:10 Women are now in Canadian anthem all you patriarchal clowns who don't know that. My version is: True Christian love in all of us command. Oil sands are affront to sensible peeps' intelligence+destroy climate .
Have wonderful day unless u r basher el assad then I say Rot in hell.X
5313 2018-06-14 15:42:08 Winner takes oil

5316 2018-06-14 15:41:57 The saudis must be feeding their footballers their oil, they got gas 
5317 2018-06-14 15:41:50 Saudi Arabia obviously, for oil reasons.

5324 2018-06-14 15:41:11 and I was hoping the high price of oil would decrease global emissions. 
5325 2018-06-14 15:41:10 Have to change my oil today
5326 2018-06-14 15:41:08 You should try coconut oil works wonders for me
5327 2018-06-14 15:41:06 Trump’s buddies are totally making out great. Giant tax cuts for the billionaires and higher oil prices. This is exactly what the GOP has wanted from the start. Just wait until they take consumer health care protections away. Then we will really be “winning”.
5328 2018-06-14 15:40:56 Everywhere I call they saying oil change gonna be 80 dollars
5329 2018-06-14 15:40:55 Construction of the Crude Oil pipeline to start next year..am waiting for it rn!..#UGBudget18   i needed to hear this from @KagutaMuseveni
5330 2018-06-14 15:40:54 To expand on this, yes most truffle oil is artificial. Truffle flavor comes from compounds of dithiapentane, and adding these compounds to truffle oil gives a similar flavor.

However, truffles DO leech flavor. It's why a thin slice goes a long way.
5331 2018-06-14 15:40:53 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
5332 2018-06-14 15:40:53 I must have a small leak.. was completely out of transmission fluid.  The guy at the oil change place by Kroger gave it to me free. 
5333 2018-06-14 15:40:52 A diversified economy is crucial at this time when oil revenue has fallen far below what it used to be. Attention must be paid to the non-oil sectors, particularly the creative & innovative industries which continue to thrive despite limited incentives.

5339 2018-06-14 15:40:38 Saudi Arabia should quit football and go back to Oil

5352 2018-06-14 15:39:33 Close up of the Saudi Prince shaking hands with Putin & Clive Tyldesley goes straight in with the satire: “they’re probably negotiating an oil deal.” Expect to see Glenn Hoddle commentating alone next game after Tyldesley is found poisoned in his hotel room. #WorldCupRussia2018

5359 2018-06-14 15:39:03 Since the USA has been energy and oils independent (we are currently the world’s largest oil exporter) these are hardly magnanimous gestures, but simply the kind of sales incentives one uses when one is selling a product one’s customer doesn’t really need.
5360 2018-06-14 15:38:51 No doubt on that, cuz most of them have 4 wife's and more, So one must have stronger Heart,  not so easy to share that. The secret is out, Olive oil!!.

5370 2018-06-14 15:38:01 I have a customer who is seeking 3K liters of hemp oil. this does not have to be high CBD, they are simply looking for hemp oil as an addative.
5371 2018-06-14 15:37:54 Short Bears are short sighted, nothing new here time to just concede defeat move on and short Big Oil & Old Auto !
5372 2018-06-14 15:37:52 Is it Dandruff or Craddle Cap.

What worked for me was was the baby hair with shampoo then apply baby oil. After use a comb to remove the cap
5373 2018-06-14 15:37:49 Saudis of course. They don't want to mess up oil trade deals.
5374 2018-06-14 15:37:46 I hate going to get my car worked on. Go in for a oil change and them mfrs find 1001 other things wrong with ya shit.

5377 2018-06-14 15:37:44 While dissecting the oil data, seen this #AcheDin data point:

ONGC profit in 2013-14 was ₹22095 crores reduced to ₹17900 crores in 2016-17, yep, 23% decrease!

While Reliance profit grown from ₹22493 crores in 2013-14 increased to ₹31425 crores in 2016-17, ie, 40% increase!!

5379 2018-06-14 15:37:38 This latest generation should continue our work on Fusion Energy, instead of wasting energy arguing about oil.
5380 2018-06-14 15:37:33 These Saudi players are too confident in their own abilities. Symptom of them all playing in a shit oil rich league.
5381 2018-06-14 15:37:31 Just watched @myronebell say climate change impacts are inevitable to our kids - while he is advocating a bill that would penalize states for opposing expanded offshore oil drilling. 
5382 2018-06-14 15:37:19 why dont any of em arab players look like the devilishly handsome arab oil tycoon in novels? 
5383 2018-06-14 15:37:08 The world needs less oil. Period. 

If people based their decisions on whether or not something or someone has high ethical standards, you wouldn't be where you are.

5389 2018-06-14 15:36:52 foi a trip por aqui, o sheik abrindo a bolsa e sacando uns caramuru de oil
5390 2018-06-14 15:36:49 More dishonesty. Canada's oil exports are up this year, just like America's.
5391 2018-06-14 15:36:48 I was a deal. Whoever concedes first had to give up all their oil
5392 2018-06-14 15:36:44 We've had a war going on for nearly two decades so if you know where that anti-war thing went it'd be great to find it again

Oh and it's a war for oil so maybe find that environment thing too

5397 2018-06-14 15:36:17 I have to say it's always mystified me as to why we've done nothing like as well as we could out of oil and gas in particular.  Where is the Scottish Schlumberger or GE or Kvaerner or Kongsberg or Baker Hughes.   The shallowness of our supply chain is astonishing.
5398 2018-06-14 15:36:14 All going to plan for Putin at the moment....that's another arms/oil deal in the bag.
5399 2018-06-14 15:36:14 Honestly that's the black label book I want. They kept mentioning in Harley she was going to environmental summits. I'd love to really see her as a scholar, presenting papers at conferences and protesting oil pipelines with indigenous people, then going full vigilante at night.

5404 2018-06-14 15:36:04 Bc We Grew Up Being Told Gore It's Some Kind Of Unhealthy Secretion Cause By Eating Too Much Oil/Sugar Whatever.
5405 2018-06-14 15:35:53 But what about the other barrels of oil?
5406 2018-06-14 15:35:44 So far Clive has mentioned Stalin, Borat, crude oil and called St. Petersburg Leningrad. Great start to the World Cup
5407 2018-06-14 15:35:43 It was the oil deal patter that tipped me like
5408 2018-06-14 15:35:36 Mo Salah will score 5 against these oil merchants
5409 2018-06-14 15:35:29 stalin one was talking about the russian coaches tasch, then paused and said "stalin had a proper tasch"

oil one was talking about putin and saudi king talking to each other, he said they were hashing out an oil deal and we'd hear about it next week

hilarious

5412 2018-06-14 15:35:27 Saudi should stick to selling oil. Football isn’t for them.
5413 2018-06-14 15:35:24 BDB (under previous branding) initiated the conflict in Benghazi with a series of assassinations. Jathran blockaded the oil terminals. The Tebu conflict predates Heftar. Not sure how he can be held to blame for today’s disaster.
5414 2018-06-14 15:35:23 Sure all taxpayers at same taxation rate. It's the formula for determining which provinces "need" the most aid that is seriously flawed so that Quebec receives far more in funding than a province like Alberta. Alberta's oil revenues counted in, Quebec's hydro revenues aren't.
5415 2018-06-14 15:35:22 So far: least Russian opening ceremony ever, Robbie Williams fill to the brim with coke, commentator mentioning oil no less than 3,000,000 times and Saudi Arabia losing the ball every 0.001 passes.#WorldCup

5439 2018-06-14 15:33:44 God bless the Italians for making olive oil a legitimate dip.
5440 2018-06-14 15:33:43 We don't really make steel.  We process it from imported stock.  I think we should make it in BC as well.  As you say, we do have metallurgical coal, which is exported with no fuss because no one can see Roberts Bank from Vancouver. Exporting oil from there would be prudent.

5444 2018-06-14 15:33:30 Inexcusable commentary from @ITV on #RussiavsSaudi instead of celebrating the #WorldCup2018 and a great goal, chose to make a very unfunny comment about a handshake between a Saudi Prince and Putin claiming they were actually celebrating an oil deal! Disgusting and dangerous!
5445 2018-06-14 15:33:23 There won’t be baby oil right?????
5446 2018-06-14 15:33:20 cmon saudi put that oil money to use
5447 2018-06-14 15:33:06 Oil up that jersey, Mr. Balor.
5448 2018-06-14 15:33:04 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
5449 2018-06-14 15:32:50 The body shop’s? Huhu bumili ako celeteque acne gel mga same price as tea tree oil ng tbs tas napaka walang kwenta :( HAHA
5450 2018-06-14 15:32:47 This is wrong. US refineries are configured to convert heavy oil into clean fuels, the sulphur is irrelevant. The world actually needs heavy crude because tight oil cannot produce diesel, whereas with the right refinery configuration, Alberta's tar sands can.
5451 2018-06-14 15:32:40 Well, we'll see in 2050 then.  This is also failing to take into account new technology for extraction as well as the slow integration of alternative energy sources into the market.  I really wouldn't worry about it.  If abiotic formation of oil is real, then it should even out.
5452 2018-06-14 15:32:30 working on my car yesterday has really conceptualized the whole summer butch look that I'm cultivating. I'm wearing it as a scent, along with the oil that I spilled all over the seat of my car

5454 2018-06-14 15:32:24 Who knew parsley root was so yummy? Garlic, leek, parsley root, carrot and Roma beans in olive oil, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Can you say divine? @samjshah @IloveLjubjana
5455 2018-06-14 15:32:16 Honestly thought Saudi Arabia were just oil merchants until recently. Who knew

5460 2018-06-14 15:31:59 Mr. President Trump maybe we need to start using more of our resources here in the US and on this continent and start exploring for oil/ energy believe we can become more efficient this way and more secure
5461 2018-06-14 15:31:55 Needs more baby oil.
5462 2018-06-14 15:31:55 Forget the golden handshake.this was an oil rich handshake
5463 2018-06-14 15:31:47 to be honest at this point extra virgin olive oil is the only thing keeping me together
5464 2018-06-14 15:31:43 IF they actually understood anything, there is more oil used to actually make the car than the car will use in its lifetime... while they drink water out of a plastic bottle they will only use once, which was put in a plastic bag... oil... it is everywhere! Goofy people!
5465 2018-06-14 15:31:43 We need a few new modern domestic refineries built. We have enough domestic oil, and more is coming. We can be energy independent.
5466 2018-06-14 15:31:22 girl, i got like 3 containers of edge control that i don’t use  one is olive oil the others are argon oil
5467 2018-06-14 15:31:22 Today I was forced to choose between a nice hot beach day or getting my oil changed, I chose the latter. Lol is this what growing up is like
5468 2018-06-14 15:31:20 It went in! Well, oil be damned...
5469 2018-06-14 15:31:17 First game of the World Cup between the two biggest oil producing nations in the world. Hope it’s not a Crude game
5470 2018-06-14 15:31:14 I don't think about calories, I just focus on quality.  Lots of salads with extra virgin olive oil and good protein.  My craving for treats has slowly started dwindling as well.
5471 2018-06-14 15:31:10 Wrong. Check out historical oil prices vs gas prices
5472 2018-06-14 15:31:07 Day 2 of my blackseed oil wave
5473 2018-06-14 15:31:07 oilers would need to give more, hanifin is better than pjuljujarvi from what we have seen so far and will only get better. taking on lucic's contract without much incentive doesn't seem to make much sense. also i feel chiarelli wouldnt be able to make a deal this good for the oil
5474 2018-06-14 15:31:05 I did not think we would be getting almost daily frost warnings, using the heated seats in Ginger and running the oil furnace in the middle of June, but here we are.

5478 2018-06-14 15:30:55 Noteworthy that when Heftar ousted Jathran, it was accomplished peacefully and no oil tanks burned. Jathran’s apology to the Libyan people was apparently meaningless.
5479 2018-06-14 15:30:54 Yeed think way aww that oil money Saudi Arabia would be able to buy messi or salah, anycunt half decent!
5480 2018-06-14 15:30:45 If I don’t get an oil change today I might as well walk to School from now on shit
5481 2018-06-14 15:30:44 "supply the world with oil produced the canadian way". so ship dirty oil without refining it, leading to higher domestic costs and having to buy back at a premium what we could produce. got it.
5482 2018-06-14 15:30:41 Putin made sure he got Saudi for the opening game, he and the Prince busy fixing the oil price

5503 2018-06-14 15:28:56 Many references to oil we had aswell? I'm 14 on the sweepstake
5504 2018-06-14 15:28:55 @1a The future need for renewable energy will require a significant amount of land that is largely undeveloped. I'm curious as to your panelists thoughts on opening Bears Ears and Grand Staircase not to oil and gas drilling, but to renewable (primarily solar) development?
5505 2018-06-14 15:28:48 Pros: 
3 year Turn Around(Always New New)
Lower Payments(Only paying 40-50% of MSRP)
Warranties(Major problems are covered)
Free Maintenance(most or all of the oil changes and work is covered)
5506 2018-06-14 15:28:40 I mean, what’s wrong with solar? I’d much rather get me power from solar than oil or natural gas. Though around here hydro is where it’s at
5507 2018-06-14 15:28:30 Give me oil, give you 3 points

5509 2018-06-14 15:28:22 Hemp based (not Marijuana based) CBD oil super helpful with stress, but you probably know this already. It’s legal in all 50 states, so you can carry while traveling in US, as long as Hemp is clearly marked on the bottle. Best wishes.

5511 2018-06-14 15:28:09 Trump can influence oil prices by his nutty actions. Instability the the markets cause prices to rise.
5512 2018-06-14 15:28:05 I find it strange that Miss Gamma and her organization supports Trump’s reduction of the spaces, despite the oil/gas industry not having anything to gain from it. What was Trump’s intention to repurpose these national lands? Turning them into a shopping center and parking lot?

5524 2018-06-14 15:26:42 There's no doubt in my mind that Putin and that Prince have some side oil deal riding on this game.

5527 2018-06-14 15:26:26 Agreed he doesn’t need defending but here I go anyway. Oil, coal & other fossil fuels r dead creatures that died millions of years ago, hence fossil, y should we use those dead creatures when the  gives us all the power we’ll use in a year in 1 solar day? I’m with the /1
5528 2018-06-14 15:26:23 The Oil and Weapons-grade uranium match kicks us off @juniorxjuan #WorldCup. #RUSKSA
5529 2018-06-14 15:26:22 Who knew... Mohammad Bin Salman and Vladimir Putin brought together again by something that’s not oil politics. Unless, the WC fixture is probably an afterparty to some talks we are oblivious of  #WorldCup2018 #RUSSAU #WorldCup
5530 2018-06-14 15:26:21 Will you remove the ginger after the oil is heated or just use it to cook/fry whatever you want to prepare?
5531 2018-06-14 15:26:13 #WorldCup2018 I see Russia's oil prices going up.
5532 2018-06-14 15:26:13 We were there in the mid-fifties, when the reality of WWII was still present:  unexplored ammunition/bombs, maybe behind our school, Japanese soldiers hiding out who had not surrendered, a tank across the street from our house, in which we played!  My dad ran the oil drum farm.
5533 2018-06-14 15:26:13 If there’s going to be any fixed games this World Cup it’s this one... Russia and Saudi Arabia ??? Definitely 15 oil plants up for grabs here
5534 2018-06-14 15:26:03 Oil merchants vs Putin bombing
5535 2018-06-14 15:26:03 #WorldCup This Fixture Smells like Oil

5538 2018-06-14 15:25:55 At the end of the day, wind and solar don't add up to much. They cost a lot and provide too little, due to their diffuse and intermittent nature. Yet an unholy alliance of oil & gas companies, renewable energy suppliers, and their band of paid lobbyists and politicians love them.
5539 2018-06-14 15:25:54 Why are you spewing conspiracy theories and pushing chiropractics? Chiropractics is NOT based on science! It was LITERALLY started by a con artist/snake oil salesman. I’m a bit stunned. You are doing a major disservice to all #CPPs out there
5540 2018-06-14 15:25:50 You lied about your foundation donating to America’s vets and was forced to pay only after being exposed by David Fahrenthold. You’re a fraud and a snake oil salesman.
5541 2018-06-14 15:25:42 Oil money doesn’t fix everything sorry Saudi Arabia. What a start to the World Cup tho #WorldCupRussia2018

5548 2018-06-14 15:25:23 So incredibly gross. Unfortunately, the maga crowd will believe none of the glaring facts that they’ve been swindled by the dumbest snake oil salesmen there ever was.
5549 2018-06-14 15:25:23 New #WorldCup drinking game: every time the commentators mention oil or Communism.
5550 2018-06-14 15:25:14 Get ITV on a stream and listen to Clive Tyldesley make references to Stalin and oil deals
5551 2018-06-14 15:25:11 Clive Tyldesley has already mentioned Stalins moustache, Oil and has used the phrase “Mother Russia”. He’s really getting in the swings of things.
5552 2018-06-14 15:25:10 Na that’s just Putin and the oil Barron’s
5553 2018-06-14 15:25:05 That sounds like a great tip. I have never tried that before. Would you suggest adding vinegar  to just water and olive oil or does it need the milk ? I quite like the dense nature of this bread but great to have options!
5554 2018-06-14 15:25:03 え、ええ………酷すぎる
5555 2018-06-14 15:24:53 not money. oil.

5562 2018-06-14 15:24:37 It's not that we don't need to refine crude oil, it's that we don't need to refine every drop of crude oil we produce. There are significant financial and logistical reasons to export crude. When TM is built  more refined products will then be shipped in the existing line.
5563 2018-06-14 15:24:36 Vitamins E is good, Avocado oil even Jamaican black oil
5564 2018-06-14 15:24:30 The live stream I'm watching just featured two British announcers joking about how Russian and Saudi leaders probably missed the goal because they are doing an oil deal. #WorldCup
5565 2018-06-14 15:24:30 Apparently putting baby oil on and leaving it and then washing it off helps
5566 2018-06-14 15:24:26 Herbal remedies for #anxiety please. CBD oil stopped working for me. Don’t really want drugs. Desperate and will try anything.

5570 2018-06-14 15:24:13 Filling up a Bond girl full of oil, a la Quantum of Solace, maybe? But even that's up for debate.
5571 2018-06-14 15:24:09 Bark or bite oil doggy what did i say was wrong?
5572 2018-06-14 15:24:08 The tracks are full of oil tanker cars because the are no pipelines being built. Lac-Megantic disaster is proof that trudeau and barbie don’t care about citizens or safety. Just port levies  and jobs for Quebec dock workers. The rest of Canada doesn’t matter.
5573 2018-06-14 15:23:53 How did the Saudi team qualify and we didn't qualify am sure the #prince have some oil to the Fifa president 
5574 2018-06-14 15:23:52 Its an 'Oil Money' game this evening .... Winner heads OPEC
5575 2018-06-14 15:23:52 can't wait for the announcement of a joint Russia/Saudi oil deal next month
5576 2018-06-14 15:23:48 A colleague just called it El Gassico (though, does Saudi have gas? Or just oil?)
5577 2018-06-14 15:23:39 Went to get the oil changed in my truck today and The View was on the TV in the waiting room. I would rather cut off my ears and poke my eyes out before watching and listening to that crap. I got the remote and turned the channel and growled at the Liberals who acted offended .
5578 2018-06-14 15:23:31 Kid'll be in therapy for years to come

5579 2018-06-14 15:23:27 How many barrels of oil for the next goal?
5580 2018-06-14 15:23:25 First goal of the World Cup came after 12 minutes
First mention of Stalin came after 9 minutes.
First mention of Putin in a shady oil deal, 13 minutes. ITV commentator Clive Tyldsely with a solid start here.
5581 2018-06-14 15:23:23 putin and the crown prince shook hands and the commentators said they were doing an oil deal LMAO
5582 2018-06-14 15:23:18 Loser doesn’t get to ramp oil production #OPEC #FIFAWorldCup #OilJokes
5583 2018-06-14 15:23:17 I think there was a bet The Saudi Arabia guy has lost some oil Wells to putin
5584 2018-06-14 15:23:17 ได้แต่ถอนหายใจ 
5585 2018-06-14 15:23:16 Oil be the judge of that
5586 2018-06-14 15:23:14 Clive Tyldesley has already mentioned Borat, Stalin and oil deals. Even money he'll mention hands getting chopped off before 90mins #WorldCup
5587 2018-06-14 15:23:14 Texas AG sues NYC DeBlasio for claiming oil causes climate change....
5588 2018-06-14 15:23:10 EXACTLY. That article supports vaccinations 100%. What it admits is flawed is the delivery, public education (anti-vaxers) and quarantine methods (lack thereof). And some of these anti-vaxxers will be the first to pull out an essential oil and rub it all over the lesions.
5589 2018-06-14 15:23:03 A handshake that says....'we promised we'd throw this one, so don't forget the arms/oil contracts you promised.'
5590 2018-06-14 15:23:03 The guys with the oil
5591 2018-06-14 15:22:58 Has anyone considered the judicious use of boiling oil? I mean it just seems indicated
5592 2018-06-14 15:22:50 Finally changed my oil.
5593 2018-06-14 15:22:46 Use that oil money to buy a national team
5594 2018-06-14 15:22:42 So much oil to be spilled
5595 2018-06-14 15:22:41 The "Enhancing State Management of Federal Lands & Waters Act" would give states control over oil and gas drilling on public lands & waters, and penalize coastal states that oppose offshore drilling. Public lands should benefit Americans, not oil companies. #keepitpublic
5596 2018-06-14 15:22:38 Id insist warm compressions and tea tree oil
5597 2018-06-14 15:22:32 How's the Oil production Derby going? #WorldCupRussia2018

5599 2018-06-14 15:22:29 Also, how do you know things would have been better in a free market economy? Russia had a financial crisis in 2014 because of the collapse of oil prices, but they're capitalist. It just hit Venezuela harder because they rely on oil more, and due to governmental incompetence.
5600 2018-06-14 15:22:26 Putin v Oil money
5601 2018-06-14 15:22:25 Middle: Guys, this is not the right time to fight over oil!

5612 2018-06-14 15:21:51 $1.6 million per Republican plsyboy abortion, is that the going rate?

Of course your new best friend in North Korea just injects motor oil into the mother to force abortion.

But he's a really nice guy......?
5613 2018-06-14 15:21:44 Highest oil prices in Democrat Controlled areas like California. Libs love to fluff up prices with extra TAXES.  Then, use those TAXES to further line their pockets & the pockets of their friends, as well as BRIBE voters with "Free" stuff that Tax Payers pay for. Nothing is Free.
5614 2018-06-14 15:21:40 The Oil Classico, as it has billed in some parts.
5615 2018-06-14 15:21:35 So far pretty much everything is sticking. 

If you elect a snake oil salesmen, it’s “buyer beware.”
5616 2018-06-14 15:21:26 Love the hilariously misguided “gotta hear both sides” framework of shows like @1a when one side is trying to preserve irreplaceable geological structures and the other side is the freaking OIL & GAS LOBBY. These people are going to get us all drowned in boiling oceans.
5617 2018-06-14 15:21:26 And when ANWR in Alaska is operational we will be completely energy sufficient AND possibly the world's largest exporter of oil for decades to come.

More Winning!  Thanks President Trump!

5619 2018-06-14 15:21:21 Respon temen-temen kampus soal partai pembuka World Cup antara Rusia vs Saudi Arabia: 

“It’s more like an oil war than a football match”


5620 2018-06-14 15:21:17 Clinton was most recently Secretary of State, not a Senator. Weapons manufacturers and Saudis were making donations to her Foundation while her office cleared weapons sales to the latter. Oil companies did the same prior to pipeline approval, & she was a shamelessly pro-fracking.
5621 2018-06-14 15:21:14 Truffle oil is delicious if you don’t like waiting for the taste of morning mouth.
5622 2018-06-14 15:21:10 Their tactics are so lame an usually, surprised how people don’t see through it, now those bulls are stuck @ 67

5628 2018-06-14 15:20:57 my coworker makes her own skincare stuff and i was like cool great idea i’m inspired so i made a lip scrub out of coconut oil sesame oil and sugar and it worked really good until i got stoned and was too indacouch to go to the dep for snacks so i ate it all

5630 2018-06-14 15:20:54 :(( buy some bio oil
5631 2018-06-14 15:20:52 Love Clive’s commitment to this oil narrative. But someone should probably tell him Russia are not in OPEC.
5632 2018-06-14 15:20:52 CET goes back to 1659 and people have been studying the climate long before the oil companies. Including Mandelbrot and Wallis who concluded there was no human influence in their 1969 paper. So, no, in answer to your question.
5633 2018-06-14 15:20:51 Putin and the Saudi looking like they just done an oil deal when shaking hands
5634 2018-06-14 15:20:50 Last full day in paradise = factor 6 oil  #DominicanRepublic
5635 2018-06-14 15:20:49 The look before it. I bet they wagered 10 barrels of oil on who gets the opening goal.
5636 2018-06-14 15:20:44 Stalin & oil deal references already, he’s certainly walking the line
5637 2018-06-14 15:20:43 You could probably make a drinking game out of the commentators mentioning oil during this game  #WorldCupRussia2018

5641 2018-06-14 15:20:36 So the #RUSKSA #FifaWorldCup18 opener features the two mammoth #oil producers of the tournament, with Putin and Mohammed bin Salman seated together.
5642 2018-06-14 15:20:27 Commentators could get away with calling this game ‘Oil Classico’ surely? #WC2018 #WordCup2018 #Russia #SaudiArabia
5643 2018-06-14 15:20:25 #WorldCup #Russia2018 looking at the handshake between Putin and the Saudi Prince AFTER the first goal was scored, I'm now wondering  what Putin has offered the Saudis to throw this one...oil contract? Arms? Who knows. @BBCSport @ITVSport
5644 2018-06-14 15:20:25 Winner of this game gets all the oil in the world for free forever #RUSKSA #WorldCupRussia2018

5649 2018-06-14 15:20:08 In less than the first 15mins Clive Rag Tyldesley has managed to talk Oil deals and linked Stalin in because a man has a mustache. So that's senile/brexit we can add to that list of talents including biased and whatever the fuck that yayayaya thing was at Soccer Aid #Nob
5650 2018-06-14 15:20:07 everywhere shit that’s simple i know how to change oil, headlights all that shit

"Stalin had a moustache like that"

*Putin and Saudi Prince shaking hands*
"They're probably doing an oil deal."

5661 2018-06-14 15:19:42 15 minutes into this World Cup and Clive Tyldesley is having a nightmare. Already mentioned shady oil deals and the fact Stalin had a "proper tash"
5662 2018-06-14 15:19:40 Be surprised if these commentators are back tomorrow after the Oil deal comment.
5663 2018-06-14 15:19:36 15 minutes into the opening game of the World Cup and Clive Tyldesley has already mentioned Stalin’s moustache and oil deals between Russia and Saudi Arabia. I love the World Cup

5671 2018-06-14 15:19:14 Here come the oil jokes
5672 2018-06-14 15:19:13 @PaulPabst here’s a oil question for you: would you rather have Lavar Ball be your dad or not know your dad.
5673 2018-06-14 15:19:12 Clive Tyldesley’s oil chat would absolutely kill on the mean streets of Aberdeen.
5674 2018-06-14 15:19:06 All the oil? 
5675 2018-06-14 15:19:04 Clive Tyldesely should probably keep off oil references. Under informed.
5676 2018-06-14 15:19:01 Oil negotiations underway.
5677 2018-06-14 15:19:01 あん?俺を怒らせたなカチカチゴチゴチ黒焦げに揚げて欲しいのか⁈ いつものサラサラな俺じゃねえぞ
5678 2018-06-14 15:18:57 ITV commentor on that MBS/Putin handshake: "They're doing an oil deal, it's nothing to do with the match."  #worldcup
5679 2018-06-14 15:18:52 This Oil Derby is becoming interesting.

5680 2018-06-14 15:18:51 Commentator on Putin's handshake to Saudi's king (or Prince, idk) after that first goal "..they got an oil deal there, there's nothing to do with the match.." lol 
5681 2018-06-14 15:18:51 I'm Oil Can Harry! And I'm Roar!
5682 2018-06-14 15:18:49 oil football the 2 biggest distributors #RussiavsSaudi second leg next week 
5683 2018-06-14 15:18:46 Clive's full of it today. "Stalin had a proper tache" and "they're doing an oil deal" the highlights. Why would they be doing an oil deal Clive? They both have shitloads of oil.
5684 2018-06-14 15:18:46 If Russia lose this game oil and petrol will be €10 per litre tomorrow. #WorldCup #WorldCupRussia2018 #WorldCup2018
5685 2018-06-14 15:18:43 "They're doing an oil deal, it has nothing to do with the match."
"That's the Crown Prince."
"There is a big OPEC meeting later this week I believe."
5686 2018-06-14 15:18:43 what a save.... come you oil tycoons  #COYOT
5687 2018-06-14 15:18:42 Wow diving into Venezuela real early in the conversation today. They were a dictatorship before the oil market crashed, so i don't know how the workers had ownership of the means of production if they have no control over it...
5688 2018-06-14 15:18:39 That handshake between Putin and Saudi Arabia's leader was actually over a newly signed oil deal...wife swapping also within the clauses. 

Bringing you REAL news here first 
#WorldCup
5689 2018-06-14 15:18:38 Clive Tyldesley is going HAM with this commentary. Not even 20 minutes in and he’s talking Stalin and illegal oil deals! #WorldCup
5690 2018-06-14 15:18:31 You really can't go wrong with falafel sandwiches in pita, served with hummus. You can get vegan yoghurt and mix it with cucumbers, lemon, salt, garlic, mint, dill, and olive oil to make a creamy tzatziki sauce to go with it too.
5691 2018-06-14 15:18:27 Ye Nehru ka chamcha uksa raha h jisse modi oil ke interest ko sacrifice kr de . Election year me oil price hike ka result public anger...
5692 2018-06-14 15:18:27 itv just showed putin and one of the saudi princes shaking hands after the 1st goal and clive just called it an oil deal 
5693 2018-06-14 15:18:21 Putin just shook hands with the Saudi prince.. Watch for oil prices going up now! #FifaWorldCup2018
5694 2018-06-14 15:18:20 Russia now have half of USA's oil after that handshake.
5695 2018-06-14 15:18:20 Odds on Martin Tyler “disappearing” before the end of the tournament? 15 mins in he’s mentioned Stalin and suggested putin could be doing an oil deal
5696 2018-06-14 15:18:19 Inside 15min for the first OPEC/Oil reference in #RUS v #KSA.
5697 2018-06-14 15:18:18 lmaooo Clive Tyldesley is making jokes about Putin and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia making oil deals at the opening match of the world cup
5698 2018-06-14 15:18:18 Clive seems to know more about the Oil market than Football...follow your instincts and feck off from commentating
5699 2018-06-14 15:18:17 Only 14 minutes into first game of #WorldCup, Clive references Stalin’s tash and oil deals between Saudis and Russians. Good auld Clive. #itv
5700 2018-06-14 15:18:17 “They’re doing an oil deal. You’ll know about it at the pumps on Saturday” 
-@ITV commentator 
on Putin + Saudi Crown Prince
5701 2018-06-14 15:18:16 Do it the olde fashioned weigh - a little pinch of nitrate of uranium added to a thimble of oil of oleum...
5702 2018-06-14 15:18:16 If we all get nuked within the next week Clive Tyldesly has the blood on his hands for making an oil joke
5703 2018-06-14 15:18:15 They show a replay of the goal, Putin and the Saudi prince (?) shake hands.  Tyldesley: "They're doing an oil deal.  Got nothing to do with the game.  You'll know about it at the pumps on Saturday morning."

HE IS WORTH EVERY DOLLAR YOU COULD EVER SPEND ON A VPN
5704 2018-06-14 15:18:15 We do what the Germans did. When the gov increased oil prices everyone left their car on the roads and walked away. The next day fuel prices had reduced drastically.
5705 2018-06-14 15:18:14 World Cup day.

Game one. 

Cruel and degrading experts in human rights VS Homophobic, crude oil money grabbing kings  

Who’s who?
5706 2018-06-14 15:18:14 Maybe it’s also good at this point to remember it’s not really a “diet” per se that was studied but addition of olive oil or nuts mostly
5707 2018-06-14 15:18:14 ITV commentators calling this match a battle for crude oil is the perfect mix of sports and commentary that should be scrapped
5708 2018-06-14 15:18:14 Wtf is that itv commentator talking about the oil deals btw Prince of Saudi and Putin? Keep it football punk
5709 2018-06-14 15:18:13 Capitalism vs. communism. Pulling for the country of oil rich sheiks versus Putinesca oligarchs. #FifaWorldCup2018
5710 2018-06-14 15:18:12 *camera cuts to bin Salman and Putin*

"they're doing an oil deal" 

More excellent punditry from ITV. #RUSKSA
5711 2018-06-14 15:18:10 That’s a lot of oil.
5712 2018-06-14 15:18:09 15 minutes in and ITV have already referenced Joseph Stalin and Oil negotiations.
5713 2018-06-14 15:18:06 28% of world’s oil exports in play #WorldCup #FifaWorldCup2018
5714 2018-06-14 15:18:06 Russia are opening Saudi Arabia like they want all the oil. #RUSKSA
5715 2018-06-14 15:18:06 "They're negotiating an oil deal" says a commentator from a country who sells Saudi weapons.
5716 2018-06-14 15:18:04 They’re doing an oil deal  #RUSKSA #WorldCup2018
5717 2018-06-14 15:18:03 A set-piece routine to counteract a passing system? Well, it seems only apt in the Oil Clasico, but still doesn't beat Tshabalala's effort as the opening goal to a World Cup.
5718 2018-06-14 15:18:02 If Saudi Arabia wins the #WorldCup, they’re all getting their own oil companies.
5719 2018-06-14 15:18:00 Lol he said it's got nothing to do with football. It's an oil deal
5720 2018-06-14 15:17:59 Host nation Russia score the opening goal of the 2018 World Cup in their 'oil derby' game with Saudi Arabia. Russian manager Stanislav Cherchesov doesn't look like he cares at all. #casual #Rus #WorldCup
5721 2018-06-14 15:17:59 Lol. The shiek crown prince & Putin  doing an oil deal in the stands, after Russia scores 1st ever international goal. Bussiness is Bussiness.  #RussiaSaudi
5722 2018-06-14 15:17:59 I loved seeing the three most valuable women in my life interacting last night 

Melted my heart &soul like the oil in your warmer.
5723 2018-06-14 15:17:59 *camera shows Putin and guy from Saudi Arabia shaking hands after the goal*

Clive Tyldesley: “They’re Doing an oil deal, it’s nothing about football” 


5724 2018-06-14 15:17:59 There is still fossil fuels  I sure as hell use the hell out of oil in my cars...
5725 2018-06-14 15:17:59 Our oceans are a public resource meant for fishing, tourism and recreation, not oil spills #ProtectOurCoast
5726 2018-06-14 15:17:58 Less than 15 minutes in and we’ve had a goal, been told Stalin had a proper tache, that the Russians and Saudis were shaking hands over an oil deal, it’s been eventful. #Russia2018
5727 2018-06-14 15:17:57 The Oil Derby comes alive 
5728 2018-06-14 15:17:57 The scary thing is you get the sense it's something they are not even considering.
5729 2018-06-14 15:17:56 "They're doing an oil deal it's nothing to do with the match" #WorldCup
5730 2018-06-14 15:17:55 Lmfaoo the commentators just said Putin’s and Saudi president are making an oil deal
5731 2018-06-14 15:17:55 Hows Martin Tyler going to say Putin and Shah of Saudi are doing an oil deal  #WorldCup
5732 2018-06-14 15:17:54 Nice to hear the commentators making Saudi-Russian oil deal jokes already... for the bantz.. only took them 15mins.
5733 2018-06-14 15:17:53 Russia vs Saudi Arabia, all I see is Oil & Gas. #RUSKSA
5734 2018-06-14 15:17:53 What's the state of the Oil market after that goal @CrownOil ? #WorldCupRussia2018 #WorldCup #Russia #Saudi

5735 2018-06-14 15:17:52 Oil deal mention by Clive after 14 mins. #WorldCup
5736 2018-06-14 15:17:52 Menthol is pretty soothing. I don't know where you live, but here we get mentholated strips you can put on your neck or forehead specifically made for migraines. But peppermint oil works just as good ^^ thanks so much sweetheart. I hope you recover real soon too!! 
5737 2018-06-14 15:17:51 And Russian Oil leads the Arabic Oil 1-0 #WorldCup #RUSKSA
5738 2018-06-14 15:17:51 Whats bad is those muscles are fake.. He inject oil in to his muscles to get that. Dude don't realize he has titts now
5739 2018-06-14 15:17:50 The commentators here are horrific. Stalin linked into moustaches and Saudis to oil already.
5740 2018-06-14 15:17:50 “ they’re not taking about the match they’re fixing an oil deal “ this commentator 
5741 2018-06-14 15:17:49 only fifteen mins into #RUSKSA and the ITV commentators are making jokes about oil corruption, amazing scenes
5742 2018-06-14 15:17:49 #FUKOFF YOUR A GUILTY MUTHERFUKER AND NOT A LEADER YOUR A JOKE AND YOU GOT PLAYED BY THE NKSQUIRT AND THIS YOU WILL SEE PLUS NO WITCHHUNT UR EVIL STEALING KIDS MONEY LIVES OIL AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN THINK OF
5743 2018-06-14 15:17:48 Saudi to just stick to oil man
5744 2018-06-14 15:17:48 Greasier foods are already a bit more active on the pH scale than other foods, because of the grease and the oil used to cook it. When you eat it, those lipids digest slower. You know how oil doesn’t mix with water? The lipids sit above the acid and can come up with some acid too
5745 2018-06-14 15:17:44 Those #Rus an them start to oil up the field
5746 2018-06-14 15:17:41 Poor goal to Concede by the oil team
5747 2018-06-14 15:17:41 3 appointments and oil changed done all by 1100.. It's going to be a good day.. Might hit up a beach.. 
5748 2018-06-14 15:17:41 Putin and the crown prince just shook over a oil deal, I am sure it has nothing to do with the match
5749 2018-06-14 15:17:38 Already cracking jokes about Stalin, Borat and oil deals on commentary. I wish Wogan was alive for this. #WorldCup
5750 2018-06-14 15:17:37 Next morning Saudi will flood the market with Oil. Just to bring down the Oil prices in the world. Take that Russia!
5751 2018-06-14 15:17:37 12 minutes into the world cup and we've already had a goal, commentary mentions of Stalin & oil deals. Bring on the rest of it. #WorldCup #Russia2018 #RUSKSA
5752 2018-06-14 15:17:36 Hahaha 15mins gone in Russia vs Saudi Arabia and Clive Tyldsley has already mentioned "Stalin" and "oil deals"
5753 2018-06-14 15:17:34 “They’re doing an oil deal” hahahahaha go on Clive

5760 2018-06-14 15:17:29 Putin shakes hands with Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, ITV commentator: they're doing an oil deal it's ok #WorldCup
5761 2018-06-14 15:17:29 The Oil Classico
5762 2018-06-14 15:17:28 "they're just doing an oil deal." 

Best bit of commentary ever

#WorldCupRussia2018 #RUSKSA #funny #commentary
5763 2018-06-14 15:17:27 The Saudi King looks like he’s just lost 1m barrels of Oil to Putin in a first goal bet there
5764 2018-06-14 15:17:26 You just lost your oil deal 
5765 2018-06-14 15:17:24 Actually could’ve went this week but i need another tire and an oil change
5766 2018-06-14 15:17:22 Clive Tyldsley has said a Russian looks like Borat, mentioned Stalin and has now said that Russia and Saudi Arabia have just shaken on an oil deal... Bit close to the mark @ITV
5767 2018-06-14 15:17:21 Hey @bryancallen @BrendanSchaub ...do you also think @chrisdelia looks like a seagull that’s just been rescued from an oil spill? #truebaby #TFATK
5768 2018-06-14 15:17:21 Yes, Minister Freeland, liberal democracy is under attack in Canada. It doesn't help any when your government caves in and buys big oil their pipeline with our tax dollars. #OilCorrupts
5769 2018-06-14 15:17:19 My man wants to chill with these oil jokes or Putin will be sending someone to get him 
5770 2018-06-14 15:17:18 “They’re doing an oil deal” @ITV is that allowed lmao
5771 2018-06-14 15:17:18 "Give me that oil  boy we had a deal"
5772 2018-06-14 15:17:17 Is Tyldesley getting paid to talk about big oil or something? Talk about the game you berk. #WorldCup
5773 2018-06-14 15:17:17 15 minutes into the Saudi Arabia Russia game n the commentator has mentioned Stalin and oil deals
5774 2018-06-14 15:17:17 Two largest oil producers... OPEC meeting next week in Vienna, Putin and The Crown Prince...

#WorldCupRussia2018
5775 2018-06-14 15:17:17 So much oil bets at stake in this game #RussiavsSaudi #worldcup
5776 2018-06-14 15:17:15 Tyldesley got bars but Russians will light his ass up if he keeps on with his slick little shots he be sending bout borat and oil deals Lool
5777 2018-06-14 15:17:15 Itv commentary so far has covered stalin, oil and borat moustaches. What on earth to they employ these people for? Talk football! #WorldCup #RUS #KSA #itvfootball
5778 2018-06-14 15:17:12 "They're doing an oil deal nothing to do with the match"
"Stalin had a great mustache"
Clive is obviously trying out for Have I Got News for You
5779 2018-06-14 15:17:08 “They’re doing an oil deal”

“You’ll hear about it at the pumps on Saturday morning”

Absolutely sensational banter from Martin Tyler.
5780 2018-06-14 15:17:07 やっぱ1年なんだ…
5781 2018-06-14 15:17:06 The fact the itv commentators just said that shaking hands on an oil deal
5782 2018-06-14 15:17:06 I’m liking the itv commentary. Now talking about oil deals between Russia and SA.
5783 2018-06-14 15:17:05 Saudi Arabians must focus on selling oil. Rubbish footballers
5784 2018-06-14 15:17:05 Did tyldlsey just say that putin and the saudi leader weren't shaking over the game but doing an oil deal? 
Jesus wept
5785 2018-06-14 15:17:04 hahahaha "they're doing an oil deal its nothing to do with the match"
5786 2018-06-14 15:17:04 “They aren’t talking about the goal they’re doing an oil deal” woah now
5787 2018-06-14 15:17:04 "They're doing an oil deal"

5792 2018-06-14 15:16:59 Are you hearing this commentator banter? Straight up talking about oil deals when the saudi leader comes on screen
5793 2018-06-14 15:16:59 13 minutes and 52 seconds until someone mentioned oil. Come on lads. #WordCup2018 #SaudiArabia
5794 2018-06-14 15:16:59 13 minutes for @itvfootball to mention oil & O.P.E.C during the #RUS v #KSA game
5795 2018-06-14 15:16:58 Fun new game: take a shot every time the commentary team mentions oil #RUSKSA #WorldCup
5796 2018-06-14 15:16:57 Now ITV alleging an oil cartel in the stands. Have the commentary team been sent on a propaganda course by Boris Johnson?
5797 2018-06-14 15:16:57 @ITV commentator on #Putin shaking hands with #MBS “they’re doing an oil deal, nothing to do with the tournament”

5826 2018-06-14 15:16:31 What Chunk said!  However, the IG report is going to be a vat of flaming oil that the Trumpsters are going to pour over the rule of law, so hang on and hope it's not as bad as they will hype it.  Let's see what Trump's charity gave to the VETERANS , as he said he would do.
5827 2018-06-14 15:16:29 “They’re doing an oil deal, it has nothing to do with the match.”

5834 2018-06-14 15:16:23 So as an American watching Russia v Saudi Arabia, do I root for the team that actually runs America? Or the team that has all of our oil?
5835 2018-06-14 15:16:23 Putin & the Saudi crowned prince definitely putting up oil barrels as wagers.
5836 2018-06-14 15:16:23 I think there was a bet
The Saudi Arabia guy has lost some oil Wells to putin

Saudis: no
5858 2018-06-14 15:16:06 The financial world watches Russia vs Saudi Arabia with interest to determine oil price fluctuations.
5859 2018-06-14 15:16:03 Have any of them mentioned Stalin twice and oil yet? The bold Clive has.
5860 2018-06-14 15:16:02 Clive saying there doing an oil deal

5865 2018-06-14 15:15:56 We caught a glimpse of an angel with a row of cauterized nubs that attempted to flit around fruitlessly, made of oil. It gave us a locket.

5874 2018-06-14 15:15:38 Oil prices going up
5875 2018-06-14 15:15:37 But it’s not made of cats but for cats. It’s another mink oil/baby oil issue.

5878 2018-06-14 15:15:23 Gotta say..the first 12 mins of this #RussiavsSaudi match has been a whole lot better than I expected. Let us hope it continues for the next 80 or so minutes that follow. #WorldCup

5884 2018-06-14 15:15:09 Petroleum itself, no. It's derived from a chemical process from crude oil. How is that natural...oh, u said origin, but not what I was originally talking about. You can't change the words to fit your narrative.

Anyone talk about NG? Nope. So I'm wondering what your point is.
5885 2018-06-14 15:15:08 Why do you think Obama and other presidents were pushing alternative energy for cars, etc? Oil needs to be gone! It's obsolete. Push for all electric/alternative energy vehicles by 2025!
5886 2018-06-14 15:15:00 Tariffs (Which we expected)?  Algo gyrations?  Oil dropping? Trudeau's other eyebrow fell off?  Who knows?

5915 2018-06-14 15:13:12 WTI-benchmark for US Crude. Yet frack oil trades nowhere near WTI value. Throw in a need to export via Ocean tanker(s) for processing and super light is likely unprofitable long term. Starting to come across as build it & they'll come without proper domestic superlight refining.

5932 2018-06-14 15:11:55 donald trump was revealed to be an oil refinery tycoon in the 1994 documentary Little Rascals so you know he's deeply invested in this Wold Cup opener.
5933 2018-06-14 15:11:47 I suppose. According to EIA total oil production since 2008 is up 88%, but that was obviously driven by state & private lands. DOI data do show increase on fed lands, but still generally consistent with what @NiconomistLoris said.
5934 2018-06-14 15:11:19 Oil crack the shite jokes m8 
5935 2018-06-14 15:11:18 This brings a new appreciation to Dr. Oz for me. At least his advice is accurate 50% of the time. The trick of course is knowing which 50% so as not to buy total snake oil at a handsome price. Good luck with that.

5962 2018-06-14 15:09:36 Finally getting an oil change
5963 2018-06-14 15:09:36 yeah that’s true! like there’s more of a flavor especially with olive oil, it’s pretty bland when it’s in water
5964 2018-06-14 15:09:34 Time to recycle old terrible jokes...

With all the oil in Russia and Saudi Arabia, I’m betting this game is rigged
5965 2018-06-14 15:09:31 Frankly I think they would attract more tourists curious what they look like (though they would probably need binoculars to see them). It’s not like they’re smokestacks or oil rigs.
5966 2018-06-14 15:09:30 Oh, it's not cynical at all; most of the last 15 years of my life have been spent in environmental science. Consider laughing at the short-sightedness of these oil people
5967 2018-06-14 15:09:28 the reference was to freshwater, not seawater - but then again the stuff in the transmountain pipe isn't oil -- it's dilbit and no one knows how it will fare in seawater since there's no studies
5968 2018-06-14 15:09:19 I’ve had long relaxed hair all my life. It was sad to see it all go

5982 2018-06-14 15:08:22 Our society kills for access to oil,  yet wastes most of the oil we consume.

5986 2018-06-14 15:08:07 we need a pithy, too-clever tweet that’ll use this #Saudi v #Russia match as some sort of timely, pithy (nerdy) metaphor for #OPEC #nonOPEC oil output shenanigans #OOTT @JavierBlas2??
5987 2018-06-14 15:08:01 You forgot the bit where they're naked AND covered in oil.

5989 2018-06-14 15:07:54 Hi my name is Chico and I consider the following red flags:

-What’s wrong with Dave Matthews Band?

-The only thing in life not earned is death. 

-...so I mounted its head on my wall. 

-I don’t really want to know how to change my own oil. 

-I don’t believe those women

5992 2018-06-14 15:07:49 @meinekecarcare Is it common for your customers to make an appointment for a basic oil change and still wait 2 hours (and counting) for it to be completed?
5993 2018-06-14 15:07:42 Thursday: Get an oil change for only $9.96

6000 2018-06-14 15:07:25 This happens to me around the edges of my lips. I think it’s from getting face wash around the area. I put coconut oil and vitamin e on them at night when it happens and that’s helped.

That's Wrong, Ryan: Even a plurality of Republicans favor rules to stop methane waste. Support is not only strong, it's broad, too.

6007 2018-06-14 15:07:02 Alberta is doing well with looking beyond dig it up and ship it out when you get beyond the rhetoric. BC has a weird disinclination to get our hands dirty  Most Lower Mainlanders don't seem to know we do have smelters, forestry, oil etc. beyond Hope (the town) I want a refinery.

6013 2018-06-14 15:06:36 My guess is they conflated total US production to just production on federal lands, giving the Obama admin credit for oil and gas on private and state lands.
6014 2018-06-14 15:06:18 Match of fossil fuel money :
2nd biggest natural gas producer  vs 
2nd biggest oil producer  #WorldCup
6015 2018-06-14 15:06:17 One could ask why is the NDP supporting trump by trying to block the pipeline? The USA would be the biggest benefactor is we can't get our oil to the world market.

6017 2018-06-14 15:05:56 Don’t forget increases in gas prices due to removing 500k barrels of oil from the marketplace. Higher prices than past 4 years

6027 2018-06-14 15:05:27 If England had acknowledged us as a partner in the UK, had recognised that our assets bankroll the UK and been grateful for that, and had used the oil revenues for the real benefit of the UK as a whole, I think the case for independence would have been a lot weaker.

6036 2018-06-14 15:05:00 Can somebody please set this blogger right on Scotland's oil? It's the UK's oil and it's shared with the regions of the UK. The UK sold the licences to drill and bring the oil and gas into the UK. The revenues accrued were spent across the UK.
6037 2018-06-14 15:04:59 This has to be fixed in the house and Congress. Yet when the Dems held it for 2 years, nothing was done. It wasn’t even brought up. He’s a snake oil salesmen.

6039 2018-06-14 15:04:54 VENEZUELA IS REALLY ABOUT THE OIL. FACE FACTS.  BUDS WITH SAUDI'S BUT HATE MUSLIMS. HMM.  HATE IRANIANS CAUSE THEY'RE MUSLIMS. HMMM.  HOW DO YOU HANDLE THAT WITH PUTIN.

6041 2018-06-14 15:04:44 Maybe if there was a crude oil World Cup the opening game would be Germany vs Brazil?
6042 2018-06-14 15:04:42 Waiting on this oil change and tire rotation 
6043 2018-06-14 15:04:41 Chances are, someone is talking about something that will benefit you.

You get to decide if you take action and try something.

I used to struggle with sleep.  Quality rest is a game changer.

People were talking about CBD Oil and how it helped them sleep. Enjoying vivid dreams.
6044 2018-06-14 15:04:41 Olive oil has a positive effect for dry eye also,

6047 2018-06-14 15:04:05 now we just have to stop subsidizing big oil. or subsidize renewables half as much as we do fossil fuels.
6048 2018-06-14 15:03:58 AKA Oil Clásico. Either one.
6049 2018-06-14 15:03:58 The gas and oil prices were low under the @BarackObama Administration. I can't wait to see how you #spin it.

6053 2018-06-14 15:03:50 Raiola and Klopp are pretty much oil and water, so most likely not
6054 2018-06-14 15:03:46 Yes we know she did and hasn’t done anything since. You found 1 scientist in your 3% that are wrong. You can keep sharing links on good scientists that  are in the overwhelming minority of consensus. But you in fact have been paid off buy oil and 
6055 2018-06-14 15:03:41 Haha yeah I knew I could never make money off being an athlete, the money was working on an oil rig!! Which I started when I was 19 until I was 27. Made as much in a year as a twice a year fighting mid Level UFC fighter haha

6062 2018-06-14 15:03:27 Do you think Putin has any idea that it’s a football game and not a war for oil? Russia vs Saudi Arabia football match surely didn’t get him out of bed this morning. #worldcup
6063 2018-06-14 15:03:27 Funny how two largest producers of crude oil in the world play each other today #OPEC should have officiate this match  #WorldCup

6065 2018-06-14 15:03:21 @1a Public lands in Utah should not be given away for $1 an acre to greedy oil and gas companies, those jobs are few and far between. I support our tribes and conservation efforts in protecting Bears Ears and Grand-Staircase Escalante.

6067 2018-06-14 15:03:14 "Russia vs Saudi Arabia" - winner gets to set oil and gas prices for the next four years
6068 2018-06-14 15:03:12 When i think shit, it’s been a long time since I’ve changed oil in that...  lol no I try and change things in the spring and the fall but sometimes the feeding equip is a little lax
6069 2018-06-14 15:03:09 Sad news, but for the best. Visions of the tent uprooting and landing in Moscow, just in time for the closing of #RUSSAU - dropping startled property folk into the laps of vodka and oil barons.
6070 2018-06-14 15:03:04 #Putin #MBS and #FIFA stand together to watch a match between the two largest oil producing nations in the world, the two lowest ranked teams in the #WorldCup and two nations with spotless human rights records. And I haven't even written about FIFA! Let the games begin.
6071 2018-06-14 15:03:04 Thank God we changed our jersey,this Saudi team be looking like Nigerians..oil connection I guess
6072 2018-06-14 15:03:02 #worldcup #RUSKSA the world's top 2 oil producing nations are the 2 least-ranked teams @ the WC - if only money could buy you football success at the int'l level #PSG #ManCity etc

6082 2018-06-14 15:02:38 So basically, Two of the World’s largest oil production countries playing to win the oil production rights!!! Simply business!!! Ha ha
6083 2018-06-14 15:02:36 え。
6084 2018-06-14 15:02:36 You know stakes are high when your one error may forever be remembered as the most catastrophic oil spill in the history of the sport. Time for the battle of the Oilgarchs. @FIFAWorldCup
6085 2018-06-14 15:02:33 Looking forward to going to the #argusparty to discuss fundamentals in this gas and power market. JKM moving 2$ in 2 days, TTF gas gaining and losing half euros in 20 minutes, in the summer, with flat oil. Wondering if some of these bots are getting invited too :D #ONGT

6108 2018-06-14 15:01:30 Thanks Ellen. Just listened to your podcast on Anthony Crudele’s show. I’m your opinion, what’s  the best way to think about price movements on a day to day basis in crude oil?

6129 2018-06-14 15:00:05 The president is an actual disordered malignant narcissist. Hes literally the emperor with no clothes. Jesus needs to come and open your eyes, you're in love with a snake oil saleman.  He has actual contempt for your christianity.
6130 2018-06-14 15:00:05 Do you oil before/after?
6131 2018-06-14 15:00:04 Lubricating oil is sold in 55 gal drums, so if you want to take the low, pedantic road, you can still claim a tiny victory.

6133 2018-06-14 15:00:02 @Townofnagshead Kudos to Mayor Benjamin Cahoon (R-Nags Head-NC) for testifying to Congress against legislation that would penalize states for protecting their coast from and dirty dangerous oil drilling #ProtectOurCoast
6134 2018-06-14 15:00:01 In Saudi Arabia, if an oil field is found in your garden you must report it to the state before digging a bore hole greater than 5000 feet.

6144 2018-06-14 14:59:50 If we look at the different groups involved in today's oil crescent attacks - the Magharba, Tebu & BDB  - then throw in Jathran's talk about the LNA's oppression as a driving force we have to ask:

Although he can conquer land, can Haftar ever be a stabilising force?
6145 2018-06-14 14:59:45 Can’t wait to watch the corrupt oil rich country of Russia face the corrupt oil rich country of Saudi Arabia. About to find out who the real powerhouse is #CorruptCup
6146 2018-06-14 14:59:41 Nymex wti crude oil traders. ... what a power of my SELLING level it's worked 5 times and pft made around 3,000 U.S Dollars.... just in a single call. ...

6151 2018-06-14 14:59:30 Let's talk oil at halftime #Rus #SaudiArabia
6152 2018-06-14 14:59:30 Indeed that's why US currency has lower value than roll of toilet paper once oil trade will abandon $
6153 2018-06-14 14:59:28 The fifa president is flagged by wealth. Putin on his right and one handsome, 350 oil wells on his left.
6154 2018-06-14 14:59:27 Brilliant. National Anthem of Saudi and Russia had same words.We’ve got loads of Oil we’ve got loads of Oil, e   Atyo we’ve got loads of Oil”.
6155 2018-06-14 14:59:27 See Oil Power
6156 2018-06-14 14:59:19 The Crude Oil Derby #WorldCup
6157 2018-06-14 14:59:16 With today's crude oil price and your analysis, we can blame our Finanace Minister Adeosun, party leader Asiwaju, and Works Minister Fashola for not doing Apapa port rd, not completing Lag-Ibadan, Ore and others. Right?
6158 2018-06-14 14:59:09 It probably depends on what pub you go to. I wouldn't expect to pay £6.50 for a Neck Oil.
6159 2018-06-14 14:59:08 First WC game of 2018 between the 2 lowest ranked teams. ITV struggling a bit so decide to just talk in commentary about the fact they’re the 2 largest crude oil nations on the planet instead.. that’s exactly what all us football fans care about right now!! 
6160 2018-06-14 14:59:05 Time for Oil Classico #RUSKSA #WorldCup
6161 2018-06-14 14:59:04 Russia vs. Saudi Arabia to open up the World Cup — or as I call this match, the Oil Derby 
6162 2018-06-14 14:58:59 Watching Russia v Saudi Arabia you have to wonder what is the connection between crude oil, human rights violations and poor football.
6163 2018-06-14 14:58:52 Oil will run out in about 50 years, you have plenty of time left to point fingers to the prior generations
6164 2018-06-14 14:58:51 All I’m Seeing is Oil vs Oil.  These two countries let alone brings us Most Disrespectful Tourists that we have to tolerate #FifaWorldCup2018
6165 2018-06-14 14:58:46 Wrong about RNH, Everyone already knows Oil can’t move Lucic unless they take bad contract back, and Sens.... are a shit show. Why aren’t you back on Sportsnet? Oh yeah, because you don’t report any relevance.
6166 2018-06-14 14:58:41 well this generation is taking climate change for real, so hopefully a better debt than the oil and coal screwed world we were born into? lol
6167 2018-06-14 14:58:37 Russia versus Saudi Arabia, or as I am calling it, The Oil Rumble.
6168 2018-06-14 14:58:34 Looks like oil prices are about to rise again. The Saudi coach must have used up half the reserves for his hair.
6169 2018-06-14 14:58:32 First match between the oil giants. Let's Go! @abscbnsports #WorldCup
6170 2018-06-14 14:58:31 The argument that we don't need to refine oil in the west because we refine it in the east is nuts.  You can't get it here from there, or the unrefined there from here.  Meanwhile, we're artificially dependent on imported petroleum products from gasoline to jet fuel in BC.
6171 2018-06-14 14:58:26 While procrastinating I came across this youtube video "tips and tricks for shaving your vagina" or something, and she said she shaves with olive oil, so I tried it yesterday and I have literally never been this soft. Would recommend.
6172 2018-06-14 14:58:22 Correct the battle for the oil
6173 2018-06-14 14:58:20 Where's an MbS speech? He was talking to Putin yesterday about oil stuff yesterday.
6174 2018-06-14 14:58:17 Oil rich match
6175 2018-06-14 14:58:14 seriously do yourself a favor and go get the @SolanaLuxe Beauty Oil it is AMAZING! & pick up 2 more products to get 30% off (:

6177 2018-06-14 14:58:08 These two countries are best mates anyway. Apparently Putin and the Crown Prince of Saudi are doing an oil deal during the game  #WorldCup
6178 2018-06-14 14:58:03 We’re barely a country, don’t seem to be oil rich & pure love  the gays. Corrupt ? Football ? Can’t think of any high profile examples....

6180 2018-06-14 14:58:03 Ah ha! The crude oil, human rights, autocratic regime derby. Opened by Putin. Splendid. Perhaps we could have a beheading? #WorldCupRussia2018
6181 2018-06-14 14:58:03 RT TweetPotato314: The genie light came on in my car and I’m not sure where he is yet, but my first wish is going to be for motor oil.
6182 2018-06-14 14:58:00 #RUSKSA: 1-1 written all over the Oil Derby #worldcup⁠ ⁠
6183 2018-06-14 14:57:55 They are firm favourites to sell the most oil
6184 2018-06-14 14:57:53 I’ll bet that you own stock in oil companies and are making money off of the high oil prices.
6185 2018-06-14 14:57:50 @akshaykumar refined oil becho paiso ke liye

6197 2018-06-14 14:57:23 NY attorney Genrral just filed petition against Trump & his charitable foundation for using charity $$ for personal expenses of legal bills, clothing, an oil painting of POTUS, etc. MSNBC says atty gen wrote this is a persistant pattern of behavior going back several years.
6198 2018-06-14 14:57:16 Well played @CliveTyldesley on ITV. 

“Politics has never been far from this #worldcup. And so, welcome to the opening game - between the two largest crude oil producing countries in the world.” #RUSSAU
6199 2018-06-14 14:57:14 There is plenty of oil... don’t let those people make you believe we have or will run out .. it’s a scam. Green is good but not to threaten that we will run out.
6200 2018-06-14 14:57:10 Here we go. Crude Oil number 1 vs Crude Oil number 2 #WorldCup
6201 2018-06-14 14:57:08 ありゃー。だね。

何故神宮当たらなかった。

だね。
6202 2018-06-14 14:57:00 Oil is by no means gone, nor even close to it.  Estimates say that world oil reserves will be double today's level by 2050.
6203 2018-06-14 14:56:59 I know all about it. Car only ever gets work/service done by Audi. I’ve paid for a Gearbox Oil Change, major service, front brake and disc pads, Cambelt and water pump change and rear offside shock absorber - all done by Audi. Just imagine the damage.
6204 2018-06-14 14:56:55 The Oil derby #WorldCup
6205 2018-06-14 14:56:52 Genetics, hormones, etc all come into play as well when determining body odor.
I use coconut oil and essential oil for deo, but my raw friend needs more than that because of a hormone imbalance.
Chill with the judgement.

6209 2018-06-14 14:56:43 the oil will be gone and it won’t matter
6210 2018-06-14 14:56:40 So Russia and Saudi Arabia, 2 of the world’s biggest oil producing nations will kick off the World Cup. Expect some slick passing..
6211 2018-06-14 14:56:38 @FIFAWorldCup The two biggest crude oil producers are about to play! Is that the level of commentary we have to expect from @bbc #world cup
6212 2018-06-14 14:56:21 Why not ? Gujarat has most profitable oil well of India, at Surat since more than a decade. GSPC, a oil exploration unit of state govt, is more profitable than ONGC comparatively. GSPC set up its office in Dubai by 2001, even before ONGC. Crefit goes to @narendramodi .
6213 2018-06-14 14:56:18 The oil money derby to kick things off right 
6214 2018-06-14 14:56:12 7 parts Apple cider vinegar, 1 part water, 6 parts cold pressed organic canola oil and 2 parts cold pressed organic flaxseed oil Plus seasoning (or cheat with good seasons garlic & herb). This yields and almost perfect 1:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3. Let me know if you try it.
6215 2018-06-14 14:56:12 Can’t find my tanning oil I’m pissssed
6216 2018-06-14 14:56:08 Do piss off, None of that is true. Crude oil is natural. < nice contradiction on your part. I never said petroleum. I wasn't attacking your climate religion, I just question it where you take it on faith, in contradiction of how science works
6217 2018-06-14 14:56:04 #WorldCup.     The two biggest crude oil producers are about to play! Is that the level of commentary we have to expect from @bbc #world cup
6218 2018-06-14 14:56:03 Welcome to #WorldCupRussia2018 today's match features the two lowest ranked teams in the tournament but they top the list of worldwide countries of oil production

6226 2018-06-14 14:55:41 Short but to the point article by @AP describes rough reception Scott Pruitt got by farmers and ethanol producers outside a meeting he held in Sioux Falls. Pruitt is throwing his support in for large oil producers and is getting deserved blowback! Why’s he still in the admin?!!

6231 2018-06-14 14:55:17 They will basically throw Oil and Gas at each other for 90 minutes. I’m here sipping on Coke and working. Not a fuck to give
6232 2018-06-14 14:55:09 So what now? Sell oil?
6233 2018-06-14 14:55:00 Right Vlad that's enough time for the Crude Oil derby #WorldCup

6237 2018-06-14 14:54:51 This salon is dust. Caught them outting oil on my wig before they flat iron it. Baphambene?
6238 2018-06-14 14:54:50 And what is it that the current Military Industrial Complex is fighting for all over the globe? Don't tell me it's democracy and freedom. It is killing for oil and other resources of weak, non nuclear countries.
6239 2018-06-14 14:54:48 First game is Oil company 1 vs Oil company 2
6240 2018-06-14 14:54:38 #RUSKSA in the #WorldCupRussia is a match between the largest two crude oil producers in the world. A fact more interesting than the game will be, I fear.

6242 2018-06-14 14:54:37 ITV World Cup fact the two top world oil producing countries are playing. please cut trivial stats. #talkingforthesakeofit
6243 2018-06-14 14:54:36 Ignorant comments. Canada is the largest supplier of oil, natural gas, and electricity to the US. We share the largest natural border with Canada.
6244 2018-06-14 14:54:33 Oil tycoons man do everything behind closed doors won’t hurt each other ... draw for sure. If you can set the price of oil together you can definitely rig for the points for both squads
6245 2018-06-14 14:54:32 #NOC declares force majeure on crude #oil loading from #Sidra and #RasLanuf (-240k bp/d of total production).

Whatever your position on #Libya's political scene may be, the above  should anger you & those responsible for it (#PFG/#BDB & co.) should be criminals in your eyes...

6247 2018-06-14 14:54:28 Yes Clive Tyldesley, that's right. It's the Crude Oil Clasico... and it's LIVE! #RUSKSA #WorldCupRussia2018
6248 2018-06-14 14:54:24 Anyim was SGF during GEJ , NOI was Finance Minister with greater autonomy to work unlike OBJ’s time when she could not work very well . Oil price was very high and u have DSP in NASS who can influence roads rehabilitation in d South East
6249 2018-06-14 14:54:20 Yeah, it’s not snake oil. I get the gist of what it is doing tech-wise. I’m not going to post something that I think is made-up.
6250 2018-06-14 14:54:12 That's true. This game could be seen as an Oil state derby. 
Pity they can't buy players though. #worldcup
6251 2018-06-14 14:54:12 Olive Oil is one business that spins cash like...u don't want to know how many bottles go down everyday as regards Church/Ministry activities.
6252 2018-06-14 14:54:02 Here we go then. The crude oil derby to kick us off. Probably the worst fixture in the entire tournament but fuck it. Absolutely giddy.
6253 2018-06-14 14:54:02 This World Cup is getting the opening match it deserves: the crude oil, human rights, autocratic regime derby
6254 2018-06-14 14:54:01 Not a great opening game. The great oil derby.
6255 2018-06-14 14:53:55 Hahaha just tweeted battle of oil. You missed the Polo. My god.

6258 2018-06-14 14:53:43 He also wanted to explain to me how EVERY car needs regular oil changes. Whether it’s electric or not and that I am dead wrong about the thing I have been obsessively researching for ten years. Guess who is not asking Dad for car advice again?
6259 2018-06-14 14:53:43 The 2 lowest ranked and 2 largest crude oil nations playing against each other in the 1st game... hmmmm

6263 2018-06-14 14:53:28 This is mad. That tannoy. Putin. A game between countries that are pretty good at crude oil. The crowds weird Eastern European twang. It’s like some mad Netflix anime where the bad guy is head of some huge corporation.

6306 2018-06-14 14:52:12 Commentator running out of things to say so goes with “The 2 largest crude oil producing nations” #RUSKSA
6307 2018-06-14 14:52:12 Two largest crude oil priding countries and two of the lowest ranked teams who are opening the World Cup 2018 #2018WorldCup #RUSKSA #RUSSAU #Russia2018WorldCup

6310 2018-06-14 14:52:05 ITV have just described it as a match “between the two largest crude oil producing nations in the world”.
6311 2018-06-14 14:52:03 (as an interesting side note, opening match of the tournament is between the two largest producers of oil in the world...)

6316 2018-06-14 14:51:55 ‘The first match is the 2 highest producing crude oil countries.. and the 2 lowest ranked teams’.. let’s start get the fixed one out the way early doors and move on shall we
6317 2018-06-14 14:51:54 I love coconut oil & milk.
6318 2018-06-14 14:51:54 The two lowest ranked teams in the tournament, the two biggest crude oil producers in the world and arguably two of the biggest human rights violators in the world coming head to head. What a time to be alive. #WorldCup
6319 2018-06-14 14:51:49 "The two largest crude oil producers in the world" kicking off the world cup lol
6320 2018-06-14 14:51:48 Russia vs Saudi Arabia, the oil derby LET'S HAVE IT  #WorldCup

Russia vs KSA
The thief USA didn't qualify 
#WorldCup #WorldCupRussia2018
6322 2018-06-14 14:51:47 Russia v Saudi Arabia. Oil Firm derby.
6323 2018-06-14 14:51:44 If crude oil production were the criterion, today's opening World Cup match should be the final.
6324 2018-06-14 14:51:35 It's nearly time for the big kick off, starting with the Oil Producers derby. #worldcup
6325 2018-06-14 14:51:33 I agree the USA is gonna feel it when we stop shipping water,oil,metal,lumber to them
6326 2018-06-14 14:51:32 Lets just flood the markets with oil and charge them tariffs!
6327 2018-06-14 14:51:32 I didn't register that the opening match at the #WorldCup is between the world's two biggest oil producing nations.
6328 2018-06-14 14:51:29 shoutout to clive tyldesley for slipping in an 'of course, it's all about oil' reference in the opening ceremony, causing twlldun to immediately reflexively shit himself
6329 2018-06-14 14:51:29 Two of the most powerful countries, two biggest crude oil countries, two extreme countries, the two lowest ranked teams in the tournament.
6330 2018-06-14 14:51:27 $CL_F made a new high today and pulling back, should correct cycle from 6/13 or 6/5 lows #Elliottwave #Oil

6332 2018-06-14 14:51:26 It's up to people to make their individual choices on this issue. They can cut energy use, I personally use minimal electricity and oil. Bad idea to get state involved.
6333 2018-06-14 14:51:26 Auspicious start to the ITV commentary, describing this as a match “between the two largest crude oil producing nations in the world”.
6334 2018-06-14 14:51:26 ITV pointing out that this is a match between the two biggest crude oil producing countries on the planet. The oil derby as some* might call it.

*no one calls it that
6335 2018-06-14 14:51:25 Fuck oil money countries
6336 2018-06-14 14:51:23 First match : Oil vs Oil .
6337 2018-06-14 14:51:21 "This match between the two biggest crude oil producing nations on the planet" 

That commentary opening gambit will taker some beating and we're on the first match!
6338 2018-06-14 14:51:20 The two largest crude oil producers playing today’s game
6339 2018-06-14 14:51:18 Time for oil classico
6340 2018-06-14 14:51:18 Russia vs Saudi Arabia, or Russia vs Nigeria???. Well, it's still crude oil vs crude oil #WorldCupRussia2018
6341 2018-06-14 14:51:15 The oil Derby is about to begin!! #rus vs #sau
6342 2018-06-14 14:51:15 100 per cent pure Partridge there as Tyldesley welcomes, "The two largest crude oil producing nations in the world, and the two lowest ranked teams in the tournament."
6343 2018-06-14 14:51:14 "The opening match is between the two largest crude oil producing nations on the planet. And the two lowest ranked teams." #WorldCupRussia2018
6344 2018-06-14 14:51:12 “The first game sees the two largest crude oil producing nations go head to head” 

well if you weren’t in the mood, you bloody well should be now #worldcup
6345 2018-06-14 14:51:10 “Two biggest crude oil producers”.

Yeah calm down lads we can’t take any more excitement.
6346 2018-06-14 14:51:10 Your comment makes no sense. If you have issues with the older generation using up all the oil, why would you need to be forced to use solar? Would you prefer to continue burning oil? You’re in luck—they still build and sell gas guzzlers. Go buy one.
6347 2018-06-14 14:51:07 Two largest crude oil producing countries about to do battle.. i fucking love the World Cup!
6348 2018-06-14 14:51:07 Russia v Saudi Arabia..... "The Oil Firm Derby"
6349 2018-06-14 14:51:06 @Russia @SRKKSAFC_CFC the crude oil derby!
6350 2018-06-14 14:51:06 SUCKERS ! We produce the product and we pay high prices for it because the Oil companies know we are SUCKERS !
6351 2018-06-14 14:51:06 "The opening match is between the 2 largest crude oil producing nations on Earth" #WorldCupPartridge
6352 2018-06-14 14:51:05 I like how the commentator cheekily snuck in how oil money basically decided which countries host the World Cup #FifaWorldCup2018

6354 2018-06-14 14:51:03 Time for the first #WorldCup between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Or as i like to call it... The battle of crude oil
6355 2018-06-14 14:51:03 What a weird bit of commentary: "This is a game between the two largest crude oil producers in the world" #itvsport not off to a great start at the #WorldCupRussia2018 #RUSKSA #RUS
6356 2018-06-14 14:51:02 Read up on peppermint oil and cats, though! I’m not super familiar.

6360 2018-06-14 14:51:00 "The two largest crude oil producing nations in the world." Should be a good game then.  #RUS #KSA
6361 2018-06-14 14:50:59 Didn't listen did you. He's not against energy industry, he's in favour of clean, renewable energy. He's not against blue collar workers. They also work in the clean energy industries by the thousands. He believes jobs in oil/gas can be converted to clean energy jobs.
6362 2018-06-14 14:50:58 Hahahahaha wow you worse then, I’ll make sure to get you car oil 
6363 2018-06-14 14:50:57 やっとOILが
6364 2018-06-14 14:50:57 Football + oil = Footboil 
Needs a bit of work. #WorldCup
6365 2018-06-14 14:50:57 I appreciate the recommendations everybody, but I'm not made of money  I use coconut and olive oil because I can actually find them and afford them.
6366 2018-06-14 14:50:56 Who cares about crude oil unless it's on the keepers gloves  #WorldCupRussia2018

6371 2018-06-14 14:50:49 This one shall go down in history as the Oil Derby, finish 5-4 to Saudi and they’ll be AKs all over the place at the final whistle
6372 2018-06-14 14:50:46 God I love Clive Tyldesley. 'This match, between the two biggest crude oil producing nations on the planet'

6382 2018-06-14 14:50:33 Two largest crude oil producers in the world play each other on the first game 
6383 2018-06-14 14:50:31 Feel like commentators shouldn’t mention that these are the two lowest ranked teams in the tournament and advertise it as what it is: THE CRUDE OIL DERBY
6384 2018-06-14 14:50:31 Who should I cheer ?

The corrupt homophobic oil rich country or the corrupt homophobia oil rich country ?

6397 2018-06-14 14:50:21 I can dig it .. It took me 1 year of dedicated education to my doctor before he was comfortable in giving me a written recommendation for hemp oil . The laws in TN require a doctors recommendation & the product must be properly labeled and the receipt of where I purchased it.
6398 2018-06-14 14:50:21 Russia vs Saudi Arabia aka Oil Money game

6418 2018-06-14 14:49:45 The palm oil needs to leave the food. Previously, we had safflower oil, sunflower, canola, all good for microwave popcorn and coffee creamer. How many Kroger microwave popcorns on the shelf had palm oil? 100 percent. Walmart 100%. Amazon has a choice.

6439 2018-06-14 14:48:14 There's no money like Arabian oil money.
6440 2018-06-14 14:48:07 I’m sure your health food store will have it! They’re slacking if they don’t haha Home Depot and Lowe’s may carry some all natural Neem oil that works well too.

6448 2018-06-14 14:47:38 It's a lot of guesswork for me based on my mom's instructions tbh. Sauce: sesame paste, soy sauce, black vinegar, sesame oil, minced garlic, grated or thinly sliced ginger, chili oil if desired. I start with a lot of paste and stir in liquid sauces/oil to soften.

6450 2018-06-14 14:47:31 Getting our oil to tide water is a great way to hurt trump and help Canada in the process. Win win
6451 2018-06-14 14:47:31 1) the world is not out of oil by a long shot.
2) no one is forcing you to use solar, it’s millennials vote for that by voting democrat.
3) start voting republican if you want to use more oil.

6456 2018-06-14 14:47:05 So deep I found more oil there than in the Middle East.
6457 2018-06-14 14:47:04 "All the oil" ? That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.
6458 2018-06-14 14:47:00 If Saudi win Vladimir Putin will nuke Saudi and if Russia win, Vladimir will  demand oil from Saudi loool

6461 2018-06-14 14:46:50 I'm just imagining how much money will come I to Russia 's economy just from the World Cup,  yet Nigeria still thinks crude oil is the way, pathetic!  #WorldCup
6462 2018-06-14 14:46:46 Inhoff think it's time for Pruitt to go? What does that tell you?  They'll install a sneakier, lower life form..maybe another billionaire, a top oil executive, a Devoss relative? You know, rich white trash.
6463 2018-06-14 14:46:43 Just watched @GordonRamsay 's IG stories and I must tell you that there is a restaurant in Oceanside, CA that puts truffle oil on almost everything. I refuse to eat there.
6464 2018-06-14 14:46:41 When you don't price it responsibly, how do you expect OPEC to do it. Beggers cannot be choosers even in oil market.
6465 2018-06-14 14:46:37 a. he should've never been there in the first place basically owned by big oil and Monsanto b. you losers get to explain to your grandkids why the environment is in the shots because of this guy and spanky

6468 2018-06-14 14:46:22 Synthetic aperture radar would help. Oil calms the water surface resulting in a much lower signal.

6473 2018-06-14 14:46:01 Correct in that current debt structure is problematic for emerging markets, but this presumes current high value of USD relative to EM countries continuing.  IF USD fiat dollar status collapses due to loss of reserve status ( oil/over-issuance) EM debt becomes more  manageable.
6474 2018-06-14 14:45:59 People ALSO love to believe they're smart/savvy enough not to be duped. So, in admitting he's a not stupid, people have to also acknowledge they fell for his snake oil, they we're manipulated. People don't like to admit being wrong.
6475 2018-06-14 14:45:56 #AlienArchaeologistsWillThink we had a war on our oceans and the main weapons were oil rigs and plastic bottles.

6481 2018-06-14 14:45:43 No, that’s what you get when your absentee slumlord takes the profits from all the companies who pay sponsorship & naming rights,  concert $$’s, merch sales, Stadium rental fees, tkt sales...& instead of maintaining your home field, put that  into selling snake  oil in Austin
6482 2018-06-14 14:45:40 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
6483 2018-06-14 14:45:32 What is it with the OPEC-ers and driving up oil prices for the summer...Every summer? For once can they have low oil prices during the summer so we can afford to take road trips again? #StickItOpec
6484 2018-06-14 14:45:28 At 10:45am I got a correlation sell signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLQ18) and USO on my software.
6485 2018-06-14 14:45:25 Oh, and thanks for keeping gas prices artificially high in that oil was $66.01 yesterday & oil production in US is up.
6486 2018-06-14 14:45:21 The fact were going to the oil ranch right now is really blowing me

6497 2018-06-14 14:44:10 Even if it lifts oil production caps, the #Russia-#SaudiArabia market management partnership will remain intact, Saudi Crown Prince MBS says, according to Prime news agency. "Without a doubt, we would like to continue this cooperation and move forward" #OPEC #OOTT
6498 2018-06-14 14:44:09 Up the oil #WorldCup
6499 2018-06-14 14:43:57 Venezuela, Iran, Angola, Nigeria, Lybia, strong demand and understimated again...The oil market will be in deficit the whole year even if the increase is 1mbd.
6500 2018-06-14 14:43:44 If they do that when I get an oil change? I never went anywhere specifically for tire rotation.
6501 2018-06-14 14:43:42 House Republicans want to impose financial penalties on states that don't approve offshore drilling for oil and natural gas.      WTF is this? #VoteBlue2018 @OregonGovBrown

6502 2018-06-14 14:43:35 Crude oil > British Monarchy
6503 2018-06-14 14:43:20 I'm not an oil expert so I'm not sure.  but I think a spiking dollar is a mighty headwind to commodities priced in dollars.
6504 2018-06-14 14:43:19 Woahhhh. I don’t like truffle oil. 
6505 2018-06-14 14:43:18 Please explain why we are even still using oil in 2018 when there are much more affordable energy sources available?
6506 2018-06-14 14:43:15 The #worldcup opening fixture is a big one! Gas v Oil... I mean Russia vs Saudi Arabia. Checking the markets at half-time #FossilFuelFootball #RUSKSA
6507 2018-06-14 14:43:13 Lads lads ladies and children. It's time for Russia v Saudi Arabia, the human rights derby or 'Oil'  Classico.  I bloody love football
6508 2018-06-14 14:43:09 Remember that time that Fred Koch, the Koch Brothers father, built oil refineries in Germany in the 30s? Ahh, that lovable scamp...
6509 2018-06-14 14:43:09 #Saudia couldn't even threat #russia for cutting supply line of oil

6511 2018-06-14 14:43:08 I wonder if Saudi Arabia are this World Cup for the oil 
6512 2018-06-14 14:43:06 does any Libtard read History any more you have a better chance of landing on mars and blowing open an oil well with your fart
6513 2018-06-14 14:43:02 You know we aren't reliant on foreign oil anymore and Iran is a terrorist regime right ?
6514 2018-06-14 14:42:59 หมอโลกเก่าดูผอมมากจริงๆค่ะ คงเป็นกับลายเส้นที่เก่าด้วย555 ขาที่เรียวยาวเชียวแต่สวย เราเองก็ชอบขาหมอมากก เรื่องส่วนสูงหมอเนี่ยขนาดเพื่อนเรายังเข้าใจผิดว่าหมอตัวเล็กเลยค่ะ เพราะคุณป๋าสูงไปต่างหาก /คุณคิดไม่มีบทมาสองปี คาดว่าพอได้เจอหมอบทและโมเม้นคงจะโบ้มม! เตรียมตัวเขียนฟิคเลยค่ะ55

6518 2018-06-14 14:42:48 Most truffle oil is just perfumed olive oil anyways.
6519 2018-06-14 14:42:48 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
6520 2018-06-14 14:42:46 Absolutely ridiculous. There is plenty of oil and gas.  Knowledge is power...hmm
6521 2018-06-14 14:42:40 I really appreciate the existence of coconut oil.
6522 2018-06-14 14:42:37 Erm yeah then oil went down to 45! Every time any producer has tried to prop up a market to maintain price it has ultimately failed
6523 2018-06-14 14:42:35 There is no need for production increase till the Demand absorb the oil surplus in the main time,and the price hits $+
6524 2018-06-14 14:42:33 Faith and Fear are like oil and water, they don’t mix. You have to choose one. #TeamFaith
6525 2018-06-14 14:42:32 Let the Oil barrels roll!  #RUSKSA 
6526 2018-06-14 14:42:29 Pshhh, if truffle oil isn't real then why would I pay so much extra for delicious truffle oil and garlic fries?
6527 2018-06-14 14:42:19 #AISummit @Business_AI What is AI? In my opinion, if we use the old adage that data is the new oil. Then AI is the refinement process that changes that oil into a valuable useable end product. My question who and where do I sell my raw product (data/oil) make some money myself?
6528 2018-06-14 14:42:17 @AshleyEmmax hi lovely I see your on babestasion tonight, will there be any oil?  
6529 2018-06-14 14:42:01 Its also part of reason why rest of the world has over $20T of dollar denominated liabilities...which they are now on the hook for.  If we stop exporting dollars for oil, leads to shortage of dollars.  How do they then pay off dollar debt?
6530 2018-06-14 14:42:00 SAN MARINO PEANUT BUTTER COCONUT OIL?!
6531 2018-06-14 14:41:58 I don’t have body lava, but I do have Avon illuminating dry oil mist my MIL gave me because she thought I’d like it. I think that’s love. And I love it!
6532 2018-06-14 14:41:44 OILごりごり
6533 2018-06-14 14:41:41 Oil works too
6534 2018-06-14 14:41:39 Ghana is currently predominantly an agricultural country with a lot of cash crops for export and local consumption. Nigeria has oil and consumes everything. Yet, trade along the Accra Lagos corridor informally was $10B according to USAID.
6535 2018-06-14 14:41:30 Changing our name to Fronk Burger Co. because we've sold oil and fuel since 1947.
6536 2018-06-14 14:41:24 Slept in a mix of coconut oil and a shea moisture hair mask last night. Just know my hair is like golden silk right now.
6537 2018-06-14 14:41:23 god there is all this fucking pipeline drama in my province and i'm so goddamn pissed about it!! I'm sorry alberta but y'all totally suck rn and we don't want your poopy oil spilling in our province because you suck.
6538 2018-06-14 14:41:12 Mina i stand with the oil country,oil country must beat nuclear rich country
6539 2018-06-14 14:41:09 That presumes the people accelerating electrification aren’t the same people affected by oil leverage, or that the policy makers responding to oil leverage only answer to the other policy makers—state or corporate—accelerating electrification.
6540 2018-06-14 14:40:50 I am a not and oil hatter. My family makes money from oil. But I realize the affects and nature and our health pumping green house gases into our atmosphere. I am not saying do away with oil just don’t like misleading everyone on real climate change issues.
6541 2018-06-14 14:40:47 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
6542 2018-06-14 14:40:47 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyJ-bJz4hhY.twitter
6543 2018-06-14 14:40:44 Every time I've had truffle oil, I've wondered if it was spoiled or something.
6544 2018-06-14 14:40:42 1973 US President Richard Nixon administration imposes 60-day economy-wide price freeze, superseding Special Rule No. 1 for oil companies
6545 2018-06-14 14:40:33 He made billions when Obama shut down drilling and those platforms were sent 2 Brazil where Soros had a large Brazil Oil investment. Also there were millions of taxpayer $ given, by Obama, 2 various Soros organizations and used 2 influence internal politics of various countries.

6553 2018-06-14 14:39:54 Actually since Trump has taken office we are not reliant on foreign oil. We have our own here. He did that.
6554 2018-06-14 14:39:53 The oil companies have to raise there prices every summer weekend, 

#1 reason: they need money for their Christmas party,
#2 reason: because #notley is taking more than she deserves.
6555 2018-06-14 14:39:36 I usually fry up 2 cans of paste for 2 cans of crushed tomatoes. Heat up some olive oil and garlic and then smear the paste in the pan to make a pancake. Fold over the paste till it gets a little darker than red
6556 2018-06-14 14:39:30 I was thinking of big Pharma, big Oil, big GMO pushers, etc.

6562 2018-06-14 14:38:40 @Ekmagion if you have time much appreciated if you could share your macro trends in what direction you see metals, gas and oil headed in the near term.
6563 2018-06-14 14:38:32 Asia is typing this on one of the world’s most complicated devices, which took much energy to make, and lots of oil to ride on a ship, and then a truck, and then possibly in her car, to her house, where the air conditioner is running.
6564 2018-06-14 14:38:31 Remember. While Robbie Williams sings his little socks off at Russian World Cup. Russian irregular,regular military forces have occupied Ukranian Provence of Crimea by force for the off shore Oil and Gas.Waging bombing campaign on behalf of Syrian Dictatorship in Syrian civil war
6565 2018-06-14 14:38:31 95% of oil "subsidies" are expensing of intangible drilling costs, accelerated depreciation, MLP tax advantages, and production royalties (a tax) that are lower than some pundits think that they should be.  These are not at all comparable to a direct subsidy for EV purchases.
6566 2018-06-14 14:38:26 Of course there is a new position I wanted to try anyway...get the oil baby
6567 2018-06-14 14:38:23 As high as 30% (on oil dealing companies).
 
So the man en argument di3r, ebe someday no gimme
6568 2018-06-14 14:38:07 We are blessed as a people. The land on which we stand is blessed with many precious minerals. We have oil buried under the sea and we have lots of sunshine to power our homes. However, we don't benefit from these things because of greed, ignorance and inferiority complex.

6571 2018-06-14 14:37:49 Facts known:
Coal causes cancer.
Oil causes cancer.
Machines using oil when carcinogens burn create more carcinogens cancer causing agents.
Duh

Burn gas
It can kill you

60% more jobs created than coal & oil industry.

6578 2018-06-14 14:37:07 That was a dumb decision-but remember that for months oil was below $50/barrel-around $47-48-assuming the break-even point is $50 at that time it was not a grieveous mistake..they should be happy..

6589 2018-06-14 14:36:17 Historically high energy prices lead the private sector to find alternative means. If sugar became outrageous, companies would find substitutes. In our case, we bought a pellet stove & broke even in year 1. Don't use oil anymore. Free market economics do work.

6596 2018-06-14 14:35:34 How fitting that the world cup opens with Oil vs. Gas. A fitting start to #Sochi #FifaWorldCup2018  indeed!!
6597 2018-06-14 14:35:19 Trump is actually a marketing genius. He has conned millions of Americans and continues to do so. He has serious defects of character and intellect, but he is really good at selling snake oil.

6603 2018-06-14 14:34:48 The comments on the original tweet think it’s Midnight Oil’s manager.
6604 2018-06-14 14:34:33 The more reason why that supposedly Grude oil should be refined within the shores of kenya ... it doesn’t make any sense to export it as raw and tax excessively as finished product.... kenya  chronicles... That budget is just too retrogressive

6613 2018-06-14 14:33:50 We have our own oil refinery. It's Bush administration that closed half of them
6614 2018-06-14 14:33:45 Uncertainty is inconvenient but look at how renewable progress out paced expectations. 

It's true about right now, but what is new is that now oil importers can accelerate electrification is oil leverage is used against them.

6630 2018-06-14 14:32:50 OK - i dont agree all use is medicinal but that aside, with the exception of sativex and cbd oil there isnt *any* legal access, for any use. So, really, the only way is up. But inevitably change will not all come at once.

6712 2018-06-14 14:23:54 As far as I know Yemen don't have (globally) significant oil and gas resources. Total export is around only $8 billion. Having great sea shores and 1000+ year old history, tourism should be huge. Wars don't help. There is no arab solidarity or integrity. That's the problem.

6718 2018-06-14 14:23:25 @1a founded in racism. This only makes worse the hate for anything publicly owned that can't be pillaged for private interests (like drilling for oil).  But the racism and hatred for Tribal people is incredible and San Juan County (Where Bears Ears is located) is

6723 2018-06-14 14:22:43 It is! Olive oil is a healthy fat and has antioxidants.  Vegetable oil is an unhealthy fat. No boho.
6724 2018-06-14 14:22:38 We should be charging a premium for our oil. Ethics is valuable.

6737 2018-06-14 14:21:29 oil has been high under many presidents. bottome line: opec can do whatever they want under any president. gas will go up on july 4th week, why? cause they can. it has happened with Obama, it will happen with trump
6738 2018-06-14 14:21:23 So they gonna mine it and buy more to prop it up?  You think the tar sand oil companies were trying to prop up oil at $80 to keep there operations afloat? that didn’t end well .
6739 2018-06-14 14:21:20 However, if you have brown recluse or are just totally terrified, use several drops of peppermint oil (diluted in water) to spray around once a week to deter them. Just be sure the cats don’t ingest any peppermint oil in significant quantities, cause it’s bad for their health.
6740 2018-06-14 14:21:20 Seems like the US is gearing up for another, invasion into Syria? Russia defence minister recently reported chemicals being moved, and now white Helmets. Securing oil is the goal.

6748 2018-06-14 14:20:45 Really, I think we’re at the point where we can say we’re all adults. The rest of the world has often had a rough deal from this booming corporatocracy - a very rough deal.

6757 2018-06-14 14:20:01 Is Russia vs Saudi Arabia the worst World Cup opener of all time? Unquestionably. Is the game a bigger advert for oil than football? Quite possibly. Am I still going to lap up every second of it? DAMN RIGHT.

6779 2018-06-14 14:17:38 I’m not sure...but a lower oil price (combined with US importing less oil) means lower supply of dollars being exported to rest of world...meaning even less dollar liquidity than now.
6780 2018-06-14 14:17:34 @Pontifex knows as much about immigration policy as he does about oil exploration. Catholics know that his opinions abt these matters are just that, viz. his opinions; they carry no more weight than his opinions concerning the brand of automobile he fancies.

Gently rub your face with some virgin coconut oil. It will vanish right away.
6791 2018-06-14 14:16:31 If I recall correctly the people who were given the good quality olive oil, also mostly stopped using "cheap" oils that may have had lots of additives (including veg oils).   So the increase in olive oil may have been more then what is stated.
6792 2018-06-14 14:16:27 I think one of my favourite things about #Taste18 was getting a free shot of amaretto for every bottle of "heart-healthy" rapeseed oil bought.

Conservatives call out Pruitt because of coziness with Big Oil and.... corn sales for ethanol
6827 2018-06-14 14:12:27 Looks interesting, but in reality it's simply not true, hydrogen will never be cheaper then electric energy, it's just some oilcompagnies that want to make hydrogen the new oil you'll pay for, despite they know very well that batteries would do the same job cheaper..

6860 2018-06-14 14:09:19 It's not the absence of fat that gives you cancer. It's high intake of fat among other things that gives you cancer. In plant-based diet, there is low amount of fat which can be found in oil, olives, avocados, and nuts. Plant-based diet has become a personal choice.
6861 2018-06-14 14:09:17 also massage your scalp with coconut oil about an hour before you do it if you plan on going near your roots at all bc it burns like hell and the coconut oil really helps keep some moisture in your scalp

6911 2018-06-14 14:04:32 As PVDSA (Venezuela Oil Company) production deteriorates further, the Regime has even less to trade.  At this point, it's their only meaningful export and that capability is likely to come to a halt within a year.  #Humanitarian #CrisisNextDoor

6934 2018-06-14 14:02:41 Such predictions are very unreliable, so IMO it's better to push and see. E Trucks are on their way, & see @bnef @c40cities report on E-buses. 

Cars & trucks make up over 45% of global oil demand, so oil's leverage can collapse long before E-planes arrive.

6972 2018-06-14 13:58:12 I think you've struck oil or something, fear of potentially reduced marketshare would explain the wildly disproportionate response. Especially accounting for previous similar successes and contrasted to the trend of conglomerating every company eventually comes to.
6973 2018-06-14 13:58:07 Realize that most Trumpsters aren't well educated, They work their farms or blue collar jobs & they're isolated. They're highly susceptible to a Snake Oil Salesman. They don't interact much with the rest of the world and are in a bubble. Very unsophisticated & unworldly. SAD.

6984 2018-06-14 13:57:07 We've replaced a dual-purpose product (grain-food AND/OR fuel) with a single purpose installation (solar panels with a limited lifespan).  Soybeans especially are adept at harvesting solar energy and storing it in the form of oil.

6990 2018-06-14 13:56:40 I think specialization can be good at first, to jump-start an economy and get some capital accumulation going. Also slavery was pretty flexible. Fair amount of slaves worked in mines, produced terpentine oil, etc.

7047 2018-06-14 13:52:06 "OPEC at it again. Not good." I'm thinking he'd going to try to get prices lowered. Flood the market with our West Texas oil and keep our men out there working. They are already preparing for "the crash". As it goes every few years.

7060 2018-06-14 13:51:02 Alcohol acts as a solvent that both removes stuff stuck on the metal and thins the oil to get into joints. I tried this on rusty pliers yesterday. Mineral oil alone didn't do much, but when I added hand sanitizer, suddenly the oil is penetrating well and rust is worked out.

7086 2018-06-14 13:48:16 It is not "climate dismissives." It is that, aside from nuclear, we don't have anything else to replace coal / natural gas wholesale. And even with nuclear it will be a gradual process. 100 to 150 years?

7097 2018-06-14 13:47:36 Yeah, I was planning on reusing it for cooking and frying. Does having been heated keep it from being usable in baking things like banana bread or cookies-in-cookies? Or does the oil have some off flavor now?

7109 2018-06-14 13:46:38 $DWT 450 shares at $9.21 avg. set stop loss at $8.55. Rather take a calculated loss than get stuck in an oil run again.

7112 2018-06-14 13:46:11 Probably after-all their Father was closely tied to both Stalin & Hitler. He built Oil Refineries for both Dictators. Hitler during WWII. Charles & David had a Nazi Nanny for years. It’s all in Jane Mayer’s book “Dark Money” I’m sure you’ve read it.
7113 2018-06-14 13:46:11 There’s really no need for the condescending “little man”. However, if you earn quite so much from Scotland’s oil industry then maybe you should take more interest in how badly the UK government are mismanaging those resources. More time reading, less time being condescending.
7114 2018-06-14 13:46:06 Some of these shampoos now. Coconut oil who wants to smell like a f****** old coconut anyway?
7115 2018-06-14 13:46:03 for Europe at least the positive impact of the oil price fall was significantly offset by the collapse in European exports to some oil exporters (exports to Russia fell).   Net/ net not sure there was a huge gain ...

7123 2018-06-14 13:45:10 I do too.  I have been using CBD oil for 4 years.  Opiates are not an option as they flare my mast cell activation syndrome.  

In the US cbd oil is legal in all 50 states.

If you are in a medical mj state, indica is a far superior pain killer.

7140 2018-06-14 13:43:15 Really? We have been buying from this nations for decades & at their mercy due to this, both democrats & GOP leaders are responsible. Our oil dependence is a bane on our nation & funded the terror attacks they have committed upon us, yet it should be a moot issue already.

7170 2018-06-14 13:40:25 Didn't the oil price falls actually make QE both more possible and more effective? HICP fell a lot faster than the GDP deflator, so it justified QE, which helped created a very friendly NGDP/R wedge for a while.
7171 2018-06-14 13:40:24 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.

7179 2018-06-14 13:39:26 Yes! Had an oil already (some corp brand). Wanted the balm, wash was a bonus I thought. The whole system is excellent. This scent is bamf. Highly avow bud.

I still need a little wax sometimes to sculpt, but otherwise, the balm contains well and definitely conditions
7180 2018-06-14 13:39:24 I learnt after that to always use gloves or rub oil on my hands before grating pepper

7182 2018-06-14 13:38:49 I used to be strictly 100.  But 4020s only hold 2 gallons anyway.  I've got so many tractors now it's mostly an annual event.  The Steiger my wife bought last year still had an actual Steiger oil filter on it.......

7238 2018-06-14 13:33:26 @forgefirst Andrew. I think the support of Canadian dollar is for two reasons. Oil prices, and the Canadian economy is being falsely talked-up by Morneau and the media. I personally don't see that, and as long as trade uncertainty continues, things will worsen.

7251 2018-06-14 13:31:56 Pots of boiling oil? Those little spiked things that do in tyres? Greek fire? I'm sure you could adapt...
7252 2018-06-14 13:31:52 Wasn’t trying to be impressive . But microwave!? That’s not going to be delicious lol. I have 6 over easy with a little olive oil every morning. And some days I have 2 in pancakes if I have the carbs for the day.
7253 2018-06-14 13:31:42 I've never had oil get an engine.  Coolant gets most of mine.
7254 2018-06-14 13:31:40 Like the US (brilliant), Canada (stupid) needs to maximum oil/gas production and export, reduce use of fossil fuel at home, invest proceeds into renewable energy so that we can lead the world in that as soon as possible. Educate, export, invest, win.

7257 2018-06-14 13:31:19 Oh no! Keeping fat low is good! But being afraid of the fat in a naturally low in fat non-overt fat food isn’t good! Oil isn’t good. But some avocado, nuts, seeds, coconut are amazing as long as you don’t over do it. But you know that :)
7258 2018-06-14 13:31:17 @PaulCastronovo simple way to do filet. Put garlic & rosemary in a large ziplock bag and mash them together to get the flavor and oils out. Add some olive oil and the filet and let sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Grill and enjoy with a glass of Castronovo Vineyards Chianti!
7259 2018-06-14 13:31:14 Castor oil makes me sick so no but I'll try salt water, thank you.

7263 2018-06-14 13:30:50 Policy is made by global oil and arms money through their elected lying lackeys, not US per se. These players are very consistent and could give a dmn what happens to US as long as they profit.

7268 2018-06-14 13:30:20 I eat English quinoa as I don’t believe in exploiting workers and hiking prices of food required by locals. Just like I done consume palm oil or eat Californian almonds. Veganism is the least one can do, not the most.

7275 2018-06-14 13:29:13 Saudi Arabia wants to continue cooperation with Russia on oil, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says at Kremlin talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin
“The whole world benefited” from Russia-Saudi cooperation that helped stabilize the oil market, Crown Prince says

7276 2018-06-14 13:29:11 China #Polyester Staple #Fiber market turned weak on lackluster demand. In the morning, crude #oil and #PTA futures rolled over in a firm note. #Polyester Staple #Fiber makers cut down offers and central values also moved down on lackluster demand.
7277 2018-06-14 13:29:06 Yeah, wasn't the new pipeline supposed to solve that? We make more oil than ever domestically, but prices go up. Are you a con artist or fool? Methinks BOTH.
7278 2018-06-14 13:29:01 I even doubt they're "controlling" the oil fields, the syrian gov. and SDF just signed an agreement about al-Omar field and the regime company involved is the Katerji group which has big ties with IRGC/Iran.
Looks like USA have even no idea about what happens in their backyard.
7279 2018-06-14 13:28:58 I made this essential oil rub for constipation and now I can’t stop pooping and I have a lot left over lmao
7280 2018-06-14 13:28:48 I think it is more complex
If you read the NYT article, you will learn that within the same village some complained that others got free oil, so free oil was given to all within the same village (at least in some village) and so randomization went by the olige drum...
7281 2018-06-14 13:28:30 @JustinTrudeau US is leaving us in their dust as only do the lead the world in oil/gas exports, they will lead the world in exporting renewable energy itself and associated technologies. Brilliant. We are stupid.

7283 2018-06-14 13:28:15 Thanks you have just made a great case for scots indy,,,everything yu just said  applies.

7291 2018-06-14 13:27:34 Yeah so you haven’t reach your goal on any of them, if you’re really struggling you can eat unhealthy foods like burgers and peanut butter, it’s grim but putting like 100ml of olive oil with a protein shake will really help

7293 2018-06-14 13:27:24 @JustinTrudeau drive GWG emissions in Canada down, increase oil/gas exports. They are not conflicting or mutually exclusive goals. Obama did it in US .. Americans are using less energy but leading world in oil/gas export growth & investing that into sustainable energy.
7294 2018-06-14 13:27:23 "Few understand": that "currency wars' "multi-polar world" "end of dollar hegemony" "end of the petro dollar" are trite oft repeated buzz words

7297 2018-06-14 13:26:53 Have you tried Phenergan (Promethazine)? Can be bought over the counter, it's an antihistamine so might help.. Failing that, ginger, eucalyptus oil, frankincense oil, or you could try rolling in a nettle bush  (all natural anti-inflammatorys/histamines) 
7298 2018-06-14 13:26:52 This Buhari ooo. How him dey do am with low oil price & he awarded N185b for 14roads. And u people are still angry. My concern is Amokwu -Ikedimkpe - Egbede- Opeyi Awhun road in Enugu state, now awarded. With Azikwe in his name, he neglected d road. Cow man don do Am now

7312 2018-06-14 13:24:45 @MilliesCookies do you use sustainable palm oil/fat?

7322 2018-06-14 13:23:27 I read the title of the oil and it reminded me of the smell of Jamaica..low key night buy it now because of that reason.

7378 2018-06-14 13:17:45 They want your oil and it's always about money with DJERKOFFTRUMP. Should have made a deal with Kushner.  He's got one of those little girl voices.

7380 2018-06-14 13:17:32 I feel your pain. Mice chewed through the gas line in my car. Mechanic told me I was lucky not to have died in a fireball. Apparently the manufacturer coated the line with peanut oil because it's a cheap lubricant.

7384 2018-06-14 13:17:16 Typical Trump. His lying charm oozing from every pore.  Simple words, simplistic thoughts. His supporters love that they have such a kind, smart president.
Underneath he intends to do whatever evil gets him and Russia the most oil, the most power.
7385 2018-06-14 13:17:08 Day 74 now and LG is still stalling, saying the problem is because the tech that documented it as unrepairable (appt no.5, incl 2 no-shows) didn't call their engineers.

Coconut oil is comedogenic. It lt literally chills on top of the skin and as a result you get clogged and suffocated pores, breakouts. Your skin is not nourished because coconut oil cannot penetrate through pores. But I'm the dumb one. Lol

And the final yearl of the UPA was the worst year for many reasons. 

You have lowest oil prices and boost in global economy and 272 seats what have you achieved?

7669 2018-06-14 12:52:44 Looking closer at oil. I see that now you have oil in tonnes & toe, that was not the case in earlier years? Previously we assumed oil tonnes equalled toe, but now you have differentiated energy content of oil products (or something)? @DrSimEvans

7740 2018-06-14 12:44:22 Oil prices are not the real problem, it is the lack of refineries in this country. We have not built a new one in decades. Any hiccup at any refinery shoots retail fuel prices skyrocketing nationwide.

Not sure how IL property law works specifically, but this is either disingenuous or adorably naive. Enjoy condemning rich folks repped by biglaw, guys
7888 2018-06-14 12:31:22 U said we were producing so much oil that the US is becoming independent a few months ago. Keep your lies straight. Maybe since Tillerson needs his pay off, in the form of consumers paying higher gas prices.
That big $20 average extra a week in tax cuts goes in the gas tank.

7939 2018-06-14 12:26:16 I don't do all ten steps every time I wash my face, though! I usually do two cleanses (oil and water), a toner, moisturizer, and then in the morning, sunscreen. Some days I add exfoliation and a sheet mask.
7940 2018-06-14 12:26:15 Points 1 to 3 are false. Petrol excise duty increase- was the unpaid dues of crude imports not to be paid off? The oil companies rendered sick during UPA have all been made healthy.

8023 2018-06-14 12:17:19 @POTUS has nothing to do with OPEC gas prices for the IDIOTS blaming this on POTUS.  It’s still far less than the 4-5 dollar a gallon prices were under @BarackObama until the prices had to drop due to a glut of oil on the market.  Blame OPEC!

8041 2018-06-14 12:14:36 What are they doing with the oil money?  Instead of developing our infrastructure, the money is spent on improving the lives of politicians only. Is Africa a cursed continent?
8042 2018-06-14 12:14:29 . @SpeakerRyan Historians will write about your silence as the current president tried to destroy our country. You are a spineless snake oil salesman, sleeping on a bed made of money and America’s tears. I can’t wait till you’re gone. #resist

Calling something by another name doesn’t make it so, even if the actions and the lives and the idiocy of the “Leaders” seem to make it look the same. The U.S. has a habit of calling it “War” when it wants power or oil

They sunk in tar, and oil too
No one to pull them up, or make it stop, or say they’re only dreaming  #DinoSongs @FallonTonight

Besides that, fossil fuels are dirty to use.
8185 2018-06-14 11:55:09 Reason 4 nt including petroleum under GST
1) State by state sales tax on fuel varies. Including them in GST will make rate of oil equal across d state. Which means state with lower tax will c rise in prices. This would hurt ruling parties. Possiblity dey won't agree including it

8240 2018-06-14 11:48:35 Oil is priced according to supply & demand. Ie Capitalism.

8249 2018-06-14 11:47:52 To have an effect it needs to drop at least 20% within the next two months, which is unlikely. Iranian oil has never been a thing in the US, mostly China, India and some parts in Europe. 
The production increase is mostly due to price increase, cheaters and internal affairs.

8296 2018-06-14 11:42:56 Have you noticed that under Trump, pro-Damascus forces have destroyed ISIS and retaken the majority of the country?

Obama's CIA Assad regime change programme was discontinued.

Of course, the USA has occupied the oil rich areas of Syria. No surprise.

8315 2018-06-14 11:40:58 1. Include oil products in GST
2. Increase farmer income
3. Implement health insurance perfectly to the poor.
8316 2018-06-14 11:40:47 you cancel the iran deal and wonder why the oil price is too high?

1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get now?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
I look forward to your honest answers Andrew I really do
8328 2018-06-14 11:39:19 it is a black oil beetle triungulin larva
8329 2018-06-14 11:39:14 I thought, @POTUS, that your good buddies, the Saudis, were going to keep oil prices down?

The Saudis ARE OPEC!
8330 2018-06-14 11:38:49 I didn't say let them die.   I said this country has it's own problems.  That country is rich in oil and has the resources to support it's people, sounds to me like drugs were more a priority.
8331 2018-06-14 11:38:45 @BertShowBert  What did you just give @ImMoeMitch ??? MCT oil?
8332 2018-06-14 11:38:43 #ukog #Horse . All EWT regulatory permissions now in place and EWT operations are fully funded
· The EWT follows the successful short-term 2016 flow tests which achieved an aggregate stable rate of 1,688 barrels of oil per day ("bopd") over three 30-90 hour test periods.
8333 2018-06-14 11:38:38 Have to keep in mind that many of old oil producing states have upgraded their economic engines, so reasonable to see,.
8334 2018-06-14 11:38:33 A negative terms of trade shock (say, a fall in oil prices) drives down the price of non-traded goods in the domestic economy and thereby the real exchange rate, which is defined as the relative price of a basket of traded and non-traded goods between the domestic/foreign economy
8335 2018-06-14 11:38:24 Hey, are you ignorant or stupid? I hope you are just ignorant bcuz that can be fixed... stupid is forever! Oil prices are too high bcuz we ridiculously depend on foreign oil when we have MASSIVE reserves in the US! The Iran deal was as stupid as the President that negotiated it!

8343 2018-06-14 11:36:57 Not only thinks oil reserves are infinite, but also think Democrats control the oil trade in the U.S...bless his pathetic little heart.
8344 2018-06-14 11:36:56 People ignore the genocide that the Saudi led Axis is conducting against the Yemen people because they are in awe of Saudi oil wealth and motivated by their worship of the Money God!!!
8345 2018-06-14 11:36:38 Eagerly awaiting Russia vs Saudi Arabia is a unique position to be in. 2 nations currently fighting a proxy war & what odds on more oil deals being struck than goals? Stage awaits Aleksandr Golovin & the motherland's knackers-yard defence #WorldCup
8346 2018-06-14 11:36:26 We already use more of our own oil than foreign.

8353 2018-06-14 11:35:38 It doesn't not take a government to raise the exchange rates. All you you've forgotten that oil prices, cocoa prices on the international market have effects on the economy?
8354 2018-06-14 11:35:23 I plan to use it on a shark Imma slow smoke this summer if I catch one along with garlic,red pepper flakes, dried smoked poblano peppers,olive oil and chablis as a marinade.
8355 2018-06-14 11:35:09 But seriously, this is just another reason we need to cut back our oil usage to what we can produce in states.

8359 2018-06-14 11:34:04 Trump trashed the perfectly operational Iran agreement.  Gas and oil prices immediately shot through the roof.  Trump is trying to blame others and acting like our savior.  I call bullshit.
8360 2018-06-14 11:33:58 Your right because instead of bending over for #northkorea he should be worried about actual allies n friends that he has provoked but no he’s worried about this and doing away with all of #ObamasLegacy yep looking at you rising oil prices that my #pissy #TaxReform won’t cover
8361 2018-06-14 11:33:31 It’s always oil! Lol In 2024 we’ll all have cars that run on nothing but US Coal! And they’ll be the very best cars. You can ask anyone!
8362 2018-06-14 11:33:24 That’s the problem with you lot..you act like football started when you got your oil rich sugar daddies..remember what you where prior to that and if you really think about it you’ve underachieved over last 10 years considering what’s been put into your club.

8369 2018-06-14 11:32:12 I was also thinking of the twists and turns, the skidding gravel, the tolls, the traffic jam, the over-turned burning cars, the horde of rampaging zombies, the tidal surge of burning oil.
8370 2018-06-14 11:32:08 @RepRobBishop & @RepGosar “propose financial penalties for states that block offshore drilling” – tell @RepScottTaylor to say no to an legislation that would require Virginia pay to keep oil off our shores! #ProtectOurCoast

8386 2018-06-14 11:29:34 Oversimplified. If Saudis / OPEC no longer control the oil market, then it's redundant what their oil is priced in. Buyers' market now. And besides, Qatar and Iran already pricing in other countries. Russia too of course.

8403 2018-06-14 11:26:58 Exactly, mortgages are not based on the fed rate.  Does anyone at FoxBusiness have an MBA? 

What will hurt consumers more is higher tax prices, but we need oil to be 70 dollars a barrel to make fracking cost effective.

8500 2018-06-14 11:14:12 Taking 1 millions barrels per day of oil off the Iran markets and keeping another million from being product is the cause of higher crude oil prices.  Oil prices is traditionally high when GOP and oil billionaires is in control of government. #Butta

8551 2018-06-14 11:05:50 The POTUS neither controls nor sets the price of oil and gas.  OPEC and market traders do. Prices will always fluctuate. The best that any one can do to lower gas and oil prices in the U.S. is to get 100% behind President Trump's efforts to make America energy independent.

8575 2018-06-14 11:01:39 Nah, his whole family has business ties with Israel, especially oil trade. That's why he is "exaggerating". It's hard to look pro Palestine while having business with Israel.
8576 2018-06-14 11:01:33 I just read a 10 minute thread about truffle oil. Apparently not made with truffles and smells like feet. But Anthony Bourdain said a funny thing about how awful it is...and now I miss him all over.

8585 2018-06-14 11:00:10 Aberdeen voted ion a lie of remaining in the EU and that the broad shoulders of the union would protect us if there was an oil downturn. Our EU residents and large education sector will vote differently next time as indeed should all those made redundant by the oil downturn.

8588 2018-06-14 10:59:51 ok 
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get at present?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?

8598 2018-06-14 10:58:44 Most of the oil companies are owned and run by Republican friends of Trump. Oil is finite because it takes millions of years to create oil within the earth (dumbing down here) so if you suck it all out, you're gonna wait a long time for more. Why do you think wells run dry?

3.Go All out against scammer from UPA gov, no compromise.

But with all the detractions, you keep missing the point:

8728 2018-06-14 10:39:15 Translated to price per barrel (barrel roughly 150 litres per day), water is $1 per barrel - oil $80 per barrel - petrol $150 per barrel - bottled water $130 per barrel so how do we value water? #Water #value #Future #weetfevents

8730 2018-06-14 10:39:08 I agree, and think that oil prices should be capped during peak season to stop the price fluctuations that we experience every year. Use our oil instead of OPECS and drill new wells to cut the cord and dependency from the Middle East forever.

8744 2018-06-14 10:36:46 and oil gets subsidized to the tune of $100 billion/year by the western world.
That's enough to build solar/wind and batteries and never need petrol again!
8745 2018-06-14 10:36:38 And olive oil stains garments!  Blast, have you ever tried to get an olive oil stain out of a black wool?  Impossible!
8746 2018-06-14 10:36:35 Yeah, I have traditionally also used Clas Ohlson oil paints mixed with white spirit. I was ordering the Tamiya weathering kit for exhaust work, and the streaking grime anyway, and figured I'd give it a shot! I'll let you know!

1) would scots be better off with 100% of our oil revenues or the 8% we get now?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?

8775 2018-06-14 10:31:55 When  would’ve been powered by coal &amp; oil a transition to natural gas would’ve tackled IPCC ‘Paris’ requirements. As  is already heating, cooking, running on natural gas that option to comply is gone. The Dutch fight CO2 emission reduction with 2 hands tied.
8776 2018-06-14 10:31:37 I’m sure you’ll be fine. Trident will be ok too. Don’t worry. All that oil revenue you can keep. Plus your share of the national debt.

8864 2018-06-14 10:15:34 I'd love to agree with you but we are ZERO percent dependent on foreign oil. The reason oil is so high is because of two things: 1. demand is high and 2. Trump has screwed up the balance of power in the Middle East by pulling out of the Iran deal.

8866 2018-06-14 10:15:06 Oil is western discovery/extraction/use and not related to any religion. However, oil gave huge money-power for spreading/nurturing of the doctrine of wahabism/salafism.

8882 2018-06-14 10:12:18 Unfortunately Maduro, unlike Chavez, doesn't have a clue on how to manage a country. Poor Venezuelans are stuck between their own thuggish military (supported by China and Russia) and the salivating Big Oil (supported by the CIA). In the mean time they are starving.

8885 2018-06-14 10:11:49 Look, oil prices are high because of two things: 1. Demand is high and 2. Trump has investors in the Middle East scared because he's fucked up the balance of power.

8894 2018-06-14 10:10:31 MEPs voted to ban the use of palm oil in biofuels with #deforestation as one of the main reasons by 2020. Considering the bad press palm oil has received, we can't expect the UK public to be supportive. #backbritish
8895 2018-06-14 10:10:20 #PetrolPrices 10 years on, In 2008 a barrel of oil was £74 and diesel was £1.31.9 a litre. Now its £56 a barrel and its £1.34.9 a litre?#ROBBERS
8896 2018-06-14 10:10:14 how on earth does countries of similar size, Belgium, Sweden, Holland, New Zealand who don't have our food & drink, energy sector, & so much more survive. Without oil we have resources aplenty that these small rich happy countries would die for. Don't follow the lies check facts.

8902 2018-06-14 10:08:27 Renewable energy is more labour-intensive than fossil fuels due to the very nature and size of renewable energy plants. New oil drilling technologies could increase the world’s petroleum supplies six-fold in the coming years.
8903 2018-06-14 10:08:27 By how much OPEC+ crude oil EXPORTS will increase in July above May’s levels: (I am rounding to 100s like the #EIAgov ) if you believe exports will be flat or decline, type your comment below.
8904 2018-06-14 10:08:25 You don't have any idea what you're talking about. Oil is high because you've fucked up the Middle East so badly that investors are scared. You could put what you know about macroeconomics in a pipe and still have lots of room left over for all that crack you must be smoking.

8912 2018-06-14 10:06:17 Refineries are complex structures designed to process certain types of crude oil. KPRL is an old complex that wouldn’t refine the Lokichar crude oil efficiently. Cost of retrofit / upgrade would be prohibitive.

8939 2018-06-14 10:01:53 I'm not quite sure what palm oil has to do with analogies of ice sheet melt rates. But I agree it is not a good idea to plough up vast areas of tropics to produce it. Therefore I do not buy products containing palm oil,fortunately EU requires it to be labelled- helps to avoid it!
8940 2018-06-14 10:01:50 Mr. O'Reilly what is your opinion about the high gas prices and now the oil companies are taking advantage of the American people
8941 2018-06-14 10:01:46 About the first thing I agree with Trump. High oil prices always take a larger percentage bite out of the less wealthy's budget. If it hit everyone the same it wouldn't matter so much. Makes poor folks barely afford to get to work. Higher oil prices means inflation is in the rise
8942 2018-06-14 10:01:36 Respectfully I don’t know what you meant. Many factors? Venezuela’s has been ruled by so called Social-democratic elitist that had ridden the oil country with the promise of wealth redistribution for years under a cyst of corruption. Since 1998 it turn into a cancer
8943 2018-06-14 10:01:32 It can only reach scale and competency thru export discipline. Protectionism in exchange for export requirement is an example.

8961 2018-06-14 09:59:09 I think it is impossible to see anything but a fragmented opinion at their meeting. Both KSA and Russia want higher oil prices imo, but probably wouldn't mind keeping forecast in limbo to puzzle US producers.

Make sure excess moisture is drained or patted from your veggies and protein, you don’t want a lot of liquid accumulation in the wok.

Partially steam your broccoli if using.

9027 2018-06-14 09:47:43 Young people do not control the oil companies and weapons manufacturers etc that are destroying our world. 
Many young people don’t even have a vote. It is old people that need to change their ways, divest from their toxic pensions and reject corrupt governments.
9028 2018-06-14 09:47:23 Maybe It is their zeal to diversify away from oil that is prompting it.  Earlier,some time back, their construction frenzy almost led to a realty crash of the 2008 type. It was somehow staved off with the help of 'interested' groups, who in a way softened the impact.

4+ years later:
-back acne 99% eliminated 
-cystic acne 95% eliminated 
-regular acne <50% eliminated 
Verdict: still worth it

9128 2018-06-14 09:29:18 @AmphoraA I notice that on your website your High Altitude Lavender oil is listed as having several ingredients. Does this mean that it's not 'pure' essential oil?

9146 2018-06-14 09:26:50 For one those aren't civil liberties and two even the us geological survey has stated that fracking itself does not harm ground water sources.  The keystone pipeline also is safer than shipping oil via truck or ship and lowers greenhouse gasses doing so.
9147 2018-06-14 09:26:21 Oil has been inching higher ($39 to $75/80 is huge),CBN has been pumping in forex into the market yet $$ still remains high at a steady price. Tell us something new..

9163 2018-06-14 09:23:47 We are hearing this from many years, I too had written to all major oil companies. They told mangroves is disadvantage. Imagine if we have fuel outlet big ones on both sides of EEH, how much revenue and employment they will generate. Further it will be boon to motorists.

9198 2018-06-14 09:18:32 It’s quiet unfortunate to see believers believe that an anointing oil is holy because a man of God prayed over it but 

Strongly argue against the truth that they are holy because Christ lives in them and not because of their works

9274 2018-06-14 09:06:45 ...and this oil price went up last year? People bought at a high exchange rate and they will sell at such rate,  especially in a country where penchant for profit is high. When they make their next purchase at low exchange rates,  prices will drop.

9395 2018-06-14 08:45:44 But with things less likely to run out of such as solar and wind energy jobs and resources you tax the crap out of it. Why?  Because the puppet master Putin wants to make sure Russia’s number 1 export oil isn’t affected. So much for #maga
9396 2018-06-14 08:45:34 You are not alone. I often think about what we will lose in our lives in the years well beyond peak oil

@SaraHam59703838 , So people don't want to believe that Iran is using Yemen to hurt Saudi? That's not hard to believe,  based on oil alone  and throw in Saudi peace with Israel,  I can see that. They want to see Arab against Arab.  Any improvement,  Qatar?

9459 2018-06-14 08:32:09 A Saudi-Russia agreement on #oil supply may signal a ceiling in prices, meanwhile rapid developments in EVs & Renewable energy suggest that the eventual equilibrium price will be much, much lower. Maybe not next year, but perhaps $30-$40 by 2020.

9670 2018-06-14 07:51:44 According to your MCM... Pouring oil on roads.. Endangering road users (someone almost died there), is a very genius way of protesting by domesticated terrorists aka nduthi guys
9671 2018-06-14 07:50:19 Exporting the same product and we import at the same time. Why don't we refine our crude oil at Changamwe, and use it locally. We are buying it not for free. 
Somebody advice tullow and government.
It doesn't make sense at all.

9672 2018-06-14 07:49:50 Hmm, I’d rather just take my boyfriend there and bask in the knowledge that my loyalties are far away from @HuffPost. I’ll follow my heart, and my stomach. Gimme that peanut oil fried goodness!!
9673 2018-06-14 07:49:47 I can’t believe we get Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides TONIGHT I AM QUAKED
9674 2018-06-14 07:49:38 Is it even possible to talk about the 'golden age' of anything without sounding like:

1. An evangelist
2. An old fart
3. A snake oil salesperson
9675 2018-06-14 07:49:18 I Strongly disagree with you...when did you start singing praises for Mr.President?
I am not taking side...mine is let us unite as one family and make Nigeria great like US.
We have all it takes including talented ones, natural resources, population,oil and what have you...thanks

9678 2018-06-14 07:49:10 You don't expect PDP govt to borrow considering the price of the crude oil during their tenure.
9679 2018-06-14 07:48:48 It's not the oil in egusi that's holding it. 
9680 2018-06-14 07:48:27 If the euro depreciates 10%, oil in USD doesn't need to go down 10%? Right?, but this chart is showing that it does. What am I missing?
9681 2018-06-14 07:47:19 Oil in African countries is a curse. It is possible the trucking of oil from Turkana to Mombasa is someone's cash cow. Once the oil reaches Mombasa, it is loaded into ships for God knows where?

9687 2018-06-14 07:45:55 Having a view as a private citizen is of course fine. Does this extend to a government minister dictating to management/board/shareholders? Reminds me of Hugo Chavez and the Venezuelan oil companies. Turned out well for them, didn't it?
9688 2018-06-14 07:45:54 I’ve made a major transition in my life, and I now prefer the type of peanut butter that you have to stir cause all the oil floats to the top. I look forward to this new endeavor and I appreciate your continued support

9706 2018-06-14 07:42:30 here’s an idea: if you’re not a doctor, stop giving people with medical conditions suggestions just because you think you’re knowledgeable in the subject. I lost track of how many times I’ve heard “go for a run,” “eat better,” and “try fish oil” for treatment for my conditions.
9707 2018-06-14 07:42:21 Well Buhari didn’t cause the drop in oil prices and he also didn’t deplete the treasury that he met so he can’t be blamed for how the economy is today

9709 2018-06-14 07:41:49 I have endorsed the pipelines. The Saudi, Iran Yemen U.S. Israel proxy war is siege warfare and near equal to WW 2. with the modern prosperity.

9713 2018-06-14 07:40:22 If OPEC is cutting supply or demand is low then the price goes up. You know what that means for our domestic oil producers? We are now in a position to drill more & sell it to others around the world. Last time the prices dropped due to OPEC over drilling to slow our shale boom.

I put dried rice and oil in a pan then started to cook. When it didn't look right I put in more oil.

It still didn't look right so I turned up the heat.

In the end it was black, geasy and crunchy.
9731 2018-06-14 07:36:13 The Permian Basin has enough oil for us for at least the next century. Then there is Alaska. We just need to build more refineries (punishing regs made that very hard). Fuel independence, YES!!

9735 2018-06-14 07:35:57 My point is how batteries are made and what it (the environment) costs to produce those batteries. Hydrogen is what I know one of the base element of Water (H2O) so where is that ‘literally made from oil’ come from?
