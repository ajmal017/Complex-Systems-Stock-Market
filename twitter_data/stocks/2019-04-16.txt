39 2019-04-16 23:43:36 apple stocks rise by 30%.
40 2019-04-16 23:43:23 US stocks have ended slightly higher with the S&P500 inching closer to its all-time high following a string of mostly positive earnings while a drop in healthcare shares limited the advance. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 17 points lower at 6,252. #ausshares #stockmarket
41 2019-04-16 23:42:38 Yeah, that’s a whole ‘nother issue. I just love the classic light and shadow “black & white” look going on. I still do film photography, mostly on vintage film stocks, so that is what I mostly noticed I guess - light and shadow, composition, shape and form. 
42 2019-04-16 23:42:34 For what it's worth there are no other profitable Bitcoin mining stocks either
43 2019-04-16 23:42:27 Emh is a garbage company....just fyi....I have seen them at the expo and they do look sketchy and they were pumping the stocks.
44 2019-04-16 23:42:13 They made money on their stocks or something.  They can't imagine anyone who is no better off than he was in 2009.  The lower third for whom the recovery does not exist.
45 2019-04-16 23:41:41 WHAT'S the SAYING: BEATING A DEAD HORSE!  But I guess they need to get paid and with almost nothing passed by Pelosi & Crew there isn't much to talk
about! OR IS THERE, THE ECONOMY IS GREAT, STOCKS ARE GREAT, TRADE IS GETTING A GOOD REVIEW, WE CAN BUY A HOME CHEAP!  HUMMM!
46 2019-04-16 23:41:25 A lot of stocks at resistance if not already rolling over from resistance. I finally think this XMas eve rally is over.
47 2019-04-16 23:40:45 I think removing him from office would be great for everything including stocks.

50 2019-04-16 23:39:21 Why not stop selling and Grandfather everyone who has them?..same way the bump stocks should have been handled..
51 2019-04-16 23:37:49 @Stash I really appreciate all the individual company stocks you offer now. But is there any way you guys can organize the companies into their sectors so it’s easier to navigate to what you would like to purchase? Thanks!
52 2019-04-16 23:37:44 You can say 14/1 odds for Tiger overvalued him. And I agree. But the fact is, Tiger won. In the equity markets, there are stocks all the time that are seemingly overvalued by conventional metrics, yet they go higher. The odds are dictated by the betting market.
53 2019-04-16 23:35:41 Woolworths stocks and I think coles  fairy brand  I used last year never blocked a filter mate had blocked filters then started using and not one after
54 2019-04-16 23:35:17 SMOKE SCREEN What does that mean? All employees pay taxes. owners pay tax on their stocks and bonds, interest and capital gains. All income flows somewhere Bernie.
55 2019-04-16 23:34:43 I get it that natural gas is better than coal, but it still doesn't solve the problem.  I'm looking forward to luminescent solar concentrator, and when that is ready for prime time, I hope you don't any natural gas stocks.
56 2019-04-16 23:31:17 my parents think my money that i've been investing in stocks for the past few months is going twds buying a house in a few years. it is... but AFTER i buy a dog in sept 
57 2019-04-16 23:30:47 Obama had eight years to improve from a low starting point. Brag about the rise in stocks?  You can’t take credit and cast blame.  Trump stocks started at highs and STILL went higher. We should all be happy. Obama will be the new Nixon in a few months.  I don’t rejoice his evil.
58 2019-04-16 23:29:40 Seems more like a small thing to get rid of last hardware stocks before the they join 9th gen.
59 2019-04-16 23:28:21 There’s a thing in Wall Street where all the stocks do opposite what they normally do on Tuesday. The reversal is so consistent they have a name for it. It’s called Turn Around Tuesday. Tuesday’s are weird.
60 2019-04-16 23:26:04 Sans compter que vous confondez flux et stocks ...
61 2019-04-16 23:25:24 Example: say theres a lot of resistance near hod at 10, stocks at 9.8 stocks starts to go up to $10 , your thesis is stock is weak via tape and is going to go down , should you stop at $10, $10.20 ? Tape is still weak at $10 what do you do ?

66 2019-04-16 23:23:18 No surprise. Republican WA-35 Representatives voted against the bill preventing toxic pollution damaging fish stocks in Puget Sound. You would think that Mason County didn't have any stake in the health of the Sound. The bill passed, anyway. Take that, Mason County voters.
67 2019-04-16 23:21:32 I'm guessing either Trudeau and his friends have stocks or the CEO's of these companies gave some donations to the Liberal party
68 2019-04-16 23:21:00 Airline stocks plummet lol what’s my tax rate going to 68%  great I’m not in no way.
69 2019-04-16 23:20:30 I'm very excited to announce that my corner store now stocks Coors Banquet in the stubby bottles
70 2019-04-16 23:19:50 No surprise. Republican WA-35 Representatives voted against habitat protection for increasing chinook stocks. You know, to save orcas. Because Mason County doesn't care it's actually on Puget Sound.

Why, why must my part of #ThurstonCounty be chained to these clowns?
71 2019-04-16 23:19:26 Stocks,as in share value, not goods  in warehouses, increased turnover in UK retail  & the jobs are fulltime. Henry's point is about false equivalence, mine is you need comparable data to establish that and as Brexit is in the future we dont have it..it's all educated guess work.

How do you know what to invest in and what do you use to predict?

75 2019-04-16 23:18:08 yes. was about to retweet vol drying up on all the squeezes i posted in sensex. Noticed how strong the volumes were on previous breakouts. Breakouts on US stocks are strong with good volumes.
76 2019-04-16 23:17:24 Mine will state: "His first investment showed his stupidity, he purchased penny stocks."
77 2019-04-16 23:16:10 A truly token gesture at best from us - nothing monetary - don't get me wrong it's a tragic loss to the Catholic Church, France, and the world's architectural stocks, but let the major stakeholders cover the cost. Tourists cover their share everytime they set foot in Paris!

Socialism is theft, force, and failure.
80 2019-04-16 23:13:46 Good, after that short break @anjel2569 & I need to go shopping for the bar - top shelf stocks took a serious hit. @YodaTheSasshole & Chef are also going for supplies so keep an eye on the galley......
81 2019-04-16 23:13:42 So which TSX Energy stocks are you buying?
82 2019-04-16 23:11:26 The longer I hold stocks, in general, the more I regret selling, in general. It is less about getting attached to the company, rather its more about learning more about the company. Eventually I weed out the bad ones and then the good ones I just know so much about its hard 2sell

84 2019-04-16 23:09:44 Wondering if Trump Corp have any stocks with this list of corporations ? Funny that regular people who barely eke by on weekly paycheques PAY their taxes - while these multi-nationals DO NOT! What is wrong with this picture-&-please do not answer : DEMOCRACY!  Makes me ill.
85 2019-04-16 23:09:00 Assuming that the 400M is post tax. I'm putting 200M in Stocks/US Treasuries. 195M explore franchise opportunities and buy a few apt complexes. 5M on house/cars or depreciating BS.

Fun fact: assuming a 3% dividend yield on my investment portfolio I'd have a 6M income.

93 2019-04-16 23:01:25 Not only did people get laid off but the company’s value increased with out them actually doing anything to earn it. Now the stock market is filled with overvalued stocks and we are heading faster toward our next recession.
94 2019-04-16 23:01:22 Devaluing their stocks to own the socialists? Wouldn't that make it easier for a person who has said for decades he wants to break up the banks...to use his power to do so if they beg for another bailout?

99 2019-04-16 22:57:18 This argument dey go up and down.....abeg...If you buy something and it didn't work won't u sell it...Mourinho knew Pogba stocks were high after the world cup and wanted to cash in at that time...what happened?
100 2019-04-16 22:55:51 Prudent thread. There are a lot of people buying stocks that have no idea what they are doing.
101 2019-04-16 22:55:10 And why I don't know these stocks.  It was a Buy at 70. :(
102 2019-04-16 22:54:42 No, nearly all job losses since the industrial revolution has to do with automation,not wages.Though in this case they were just trying to boost their stocks higher by reducing overheads with out worrying about their bottom lines. They could have raised wages and still keep jobs.
103 2019-04-16 22:53:54 Of the $2.3 trillion in tax breaks $579 Billion went to stock buy-backs. A publicly traded company can use their own cash to buy their own stocks. This drives the price of the stock up and they didn’t build anything or improve the product they sell.
104 2019-04-16 22:52:41 It was weird when QCOM new hit it was going up and a lot of stuff sold off... like if someone big got hit with a short margin call on QCOM and stocks that moved with it, and had to sell fast all at once. Was weird action end of day ...

106 2019-04-16 22:50:14 I thought he was referencing a never ending increase in money supply as we go forward because the fed can’t tighten even the slightest without stocks taking a disaster. Balance sheet will grow forever
107 2019-04-16 22:49:49 3 weeks in a locked public stocks for pain, anguish and embarrassment to themselves. Plus restitution for repair to memorials.
108 2019-04-16 22:49:46 It's true that most people haven't thought about it, because most people don't have 401Ks or if they are they're pretty low-value. Industries rise and fall all the time. I'd think any intelligent pension manager or 401K fund manager would be unloading health insurance stocks now.
109 2019-04-16 22:49:10 Now that the Democrats Coupe is exposed the Resist Movement is now seen as a Bowel Movement.

110 2019-04-16 22:48:45 My trouble at high level Smash is that sometimes my conversions end up flubbing, my movement is pretty good, but I drop a lot of crucial confirms that could take stocks or even do enough % to lead to a K.O
111 2019-04-16 22:45:22 Well yeah, stocks go up and down
112 2019-04-16 22:45:18 Well if they do make 500k they’re taxed at 50% which really they make 250k but that’s probably just their base salary and hopefully get paid in stocks as well
113 2019-04-16 22:44:44 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains

116 2019-04-16 22:43:43 Don't let anybody tell you that you can't learn to trade stocks. Whether you think you can, or you think you can't; you're right.

127 2019-04-16 22:35:35 T-Mobile stocks took a huge hit after trading hours thanks to the WSJ reporting that DoJ opposes the Sprint deal, which may not even be true.

The populist in me wants it to be true, but the capitalist (with TMUS stock) in me wants it to be erroneous.
128 2019-04-16 22:31:26 Worried about investing in stocks or in a virtual currency.

Donc ouais, bof, j'vois pas trop l'intérêt au final, à part écouler les stocks de pièces détâchées...
130 2019-04-16 22:30:57 And gas prices rose to higher than they were before Trump made his 'big phone call to a few people to get prices lower."  Corporations bought back stocks that few middle class people could afford, knowing Trump would deregulate everything possible to increase their profits. News?
131 2019-04-16 22:30:04 Sorry, I’m done for the day. I’ve been very patient but this is all the vitriol and condescension I can handle today.
132 2019-04-16 22:29:20 @MarkYusko Still  waiting for the downturn on the overpriced stocks but someone forgot to inform the market.
133 2019-04-16 22:28:59 And people who put their carry on in an overhead bin at the front of the plane when their seat is in the back should placed in stocks, publicly shamed at baggage claim until ever last person has picked up their bags...from every flight that week!
134 2019-04-16 22:27:36 c'est vraiment de la blague cette console, juste pour écouler les stocks
135 2019-04-16 22:27:31 I bought some stocks/shares last year for 1K around April. In October it was valued at 7k plus!!! Went down a bit after sha but man!!! I’m finna add another 1K soon
136 2019-04-16 22:26:52 This guy must have bought stocks of gun manufacturers. Now he calling for gun confiscation. What better way to drive sales through the roof.
137 2019-04-16 22:26:47 Dips are a huge gift loading the weakness one of few dow stocks with blowout ER and pretty good guidance and it managed to set a 52 week low
138 2019-04-16 22:26:36 Does the earth even have enough uranium stocks for an indefenite 100% nuclear energy provision?
139 2019-04-16 22:25:38 That's not condescension, it's critic... well, maybe mildly condescending, but the point stands... and now we can add ad hominem to the list.
140 2019-04-16 22:25:04 Get your bump stocks turned in !!
Trump and his SC demand it
141 2019-04-16 22:24:35 Buying stocks and bonds and investing into my businesses.
142 2019-04-16 22:24:32 No overall, but kind of a yes for growth stocks.
143 2019-04-16 22:24:25 Over the long run, potential for pot stocks is great. Over the near term, meaning next few years, the trend is down, with volatility to the upside. Valuations just got way ahead of current fundamentals. $CRON $TLRY $CGC $ACB $MJNA Think internet 1.0 style shakeout for the group.
144 2019-04-16 22:24:01 Anyway, I’ll get back to reading my death threats from fanatical gun owners, and you can back to calling people Sunshine in a condescending way. 
145 2019-04-16 22:22:18 I’m not talking about you, but the dozen or so posts I had to report.
146 2019-04-16 22:21:56 Like if you buy $10,000 chain right now it won’t make you $10,000 richer. You basically only spent $10,000 that’s it. Now if u bought stocks for $100 and it increased to $10,000 then that would make your networth increases because you have something of value
147 2019-04-16 22:21:51 Let’s not even lie matt, if you were clearing $150K you’d probably end up racing late models. Or at the minimum street stocks. 
148 2019-04-16 22:21:42 More condescension. I’m trying to have reasonable discussion here. Look in the mirror and take a second to think about how you treat people.
149 2019-04-16 22:20:52 Aussie shares are set to open down after US #markets had a mixed day on the back of high profile #earnings including @BankofAmerica and #tech stocks.

150 2019-04-16 22:20:30 Sers toi, les stocks sont remplis à fond ce soir 
151 2019-04-16 22:20:13 
152 2019-04-16 22:19:54 anyone know any good small cap, high momentum stocks?
153 2019-04-16 22:18:40 I’ve been very reasonable here, but my mentions are kind of a cesspool of hate and anger and threats of violence and civil war. That tells me a lot about who the fanatics are.
154 2019-04-16 22:17:36 Tomorrow or tonight im adding to my portfolio and acquiring some stocks in the cannabis industry
155 2019-04-16 22:17:29 Hope you’ve laid in stocks of popcorn.
156 2019-04-16 22:17:16 Turn your question around the other way and we benefit from patenting the relevant technologies. Or hopefully we’ll be a bit more benevolent.
As demand for climate unfriendly stuff drops, we do not want to be the ones left holding unsaleable stocks
157 2019-04-16 22:17:07 In non-academic speak: Many times, markets move from heterogeneous to homogeneous caused by consistent information cascades that compel people to copy other's behavior. For example, after writing a scathing paper on the prospect of Internet stocks, I founded an internet Co.
158 2019-04-16 22:17:06 Thanks Boss!
159 2019-04-16 22:16:59 Wow. That's too bad. Sorry to hear that. The market manipulators like to front run stocks and then sell before you do and then you're left holding the bag.
160 2019-04-16 22:16:16 OK so basically assets like a home, investing in a business, stocks etc can help increase your networth because ur making money off of them. Luxury items like cars, clothes, and jewelry don’t necessarily increase in value which makes them liabilities and doesn’t increase network
161 2019-04-16 22:15:57 As a result of social tenants being given the opportunity to purchase their property, Local Authority housing stocks are dwindling, leaving those who are unable to purchase, confined to less desirable, poorer quality homes #AbolishRTB
162 2019-04-16 22:15:51  Check these #stocks that marked all-time highs: $AVGO, $VRSK, $UBNT, $ADI, $CDNS, $ORCL, $CHKP, $MTCH, $ADP, $XLNX, $INTC, $MSFT, $FTNT, $SHOP, $ZBRA
163 2019-04-16 22:15:39 I get you, you’re forgiven. But that’s not democracy, or the democracy those that pretend to preach, it’s not a fixed line, ever done stocks? The lines change continuously, people are like that. And when we receive more information our views could change. I respect you regardless
164 2019-04-16 22:15:25 solid!
165 2019-04-16 22:14:15 He has only played 22 first grade games, his salary will head north very quickly though. As will Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad - I would like to buy stocks in both of them, tremendous promise.
166 2019-04-16 22:14:01 Thank you, but the after hours selloff on both stocks is quite compelling.
167 2019-04-16 22:11:50 Presidents MUST be forced to divest foreign asets and stocks placed in a blind trust.

Anything short of that GUARANTEES conflicts of interest
168 2019-04-16 22:11:09 Went to an actual meat market since my local grocery store no longer stocks many cuts due to theft. I'm glad, found better meat.
169 2019-04-16 22:10:47  Have a look these #stocks that reached all-time highs: $CINF, $AJG, $VOYA, $SPGI, $MMC, $WRB, $AON
170 2019-04-16 22:10:34 Ayee stocks are the way to go. You gonna invest in Uber during their ipo?
171 2019-04-16 22:08:23 What is the quality of many of those jobs? Why are retail stocks up 17%? Stockpiling pre-brexit? By what measure were sales (whose sales?) up £52bn in 2017? Unilever's cancellation of the HO combination was down to a shareholder row. @BBCNews is either biased or incompetent...
172 2019-04-16 22:08:20 izone light stick na lang. Plssss release new stocks juseyooooo
173 2019-04-16 22:07:41 Glad to see my stocks finally making me money
174 2019-04-16 22:06:36 In the world of stocks and daytrading, you must learn to control your emotions. High emotions equal low intelligence. @Jonk87 @timothysykes
175 2019-04-16 22:06:06 That’s because of quantitative easing.

If you weren’t such an economic ignoramus, I’d start explaining how all the “gov stimulus” just inflated an asset bubble (stocks, real estate, etc).

But you prefer to ignore well known economic principles...
176 2019-04-16 22:05:49 Biggest shock drop Release ever. Wasn't that hard to cop guys. And may 4th will be even easier. Easy manual cop that day for anybody. The stock amount is threw the roof. Every store u have heard of and havnt heard of are getting them also. Shitloads of re stocks that day too
177 2019-04-16 22:05:34 That bitch who had the idea to delete the disk tray should get fired. (Ik it’s a film) Watch all your sales go down. This was a horrible idea. I’m pulling my stocks out rn before they go down. Peace!
178 2019-04-16 22:04:26 Honestly been thinking about quitting penny stocks and focusing on day trading options. There’s more advantages to options but I feel like I’m getting the hang of penny stocks
179 2019-04-16 22:04:02 Basically weak hands got shaken out and now smart money buying all those stocks for pennies on the dime
180 2019-04-16 22:03:22 Just signed up at @freetrade, considering an ISA. Disappointed at the limited number of stocks on offer. They should just offer them all like every other broker, instead, it's some weird popularity contest.
181 2019-04-16 22:02:55 Shall I just put myself in the stocks and flat myself with cat-o-f***ing-nine-tails???
182 2019-04-16 22:02:52 he is right. this is classic bull mkt parabola beginning. the entire world is throwing money at usa stocks
183 2019-04-16 22:02:47 I don't think Chris would know a valid source if he saw one, and based on his other posts he doesn't know what a fallacy is either.  Just a few I've seen him commit in this thread poisoning the well, a strawman, and here we saw him make an appeal to authority.
184 2019-04-16 22:02:17 I think we all saw Bump Stocks for what they were: a cheap and dangerous loophole to existing legislation.

The loss does not affect the 2nd amendment in the slightest, and there is absolutely no reason to waste taxpayer dollars arguing it on the floor of congress.
185 2019-04-16 22:01:06 It’s been a hard YEAR for pot stocks overall. Nothing is going right. Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo & a lot of momentum was lost. Just remember, sometimes you have to lose $$ to make $$ in the market. But most pot stocks are 10000x better positioned than indebted tech stocks.
186 2019-04-16 22:00:37 When hedge funds pitch stocks, it’s because they’re looking to get taken out...or did something change?
187 2019-04-16 22:00:08 A PC and stocks
188 2019-04-16 21:59:43 The PRA and Douglas County Speedway would like to welcome Roseburg Collision Center to our racing family! They are the division sponsor of the Super Stocks! If you need top quality work on whatever you drive, big or small, stop in and see them on Diamond Lake Blvd!
189 2019-04-16 21:59:07 Weekly statistics from @APIenergy today show a sizable 1.7 million bbl drop in West Coast (PADD5) gasoline stocks last week, which have been squeezed by ongoing regional refinery production issues.

190 2019-04-16 21:58:21 Imagine a dystopia where Chinese startup workers put in so many extra hours that Chinese startups come to dominate the world of cash burning, venture capital-subsidized story stocks.
191 2019-04-16 21:57:53 Ken is the biggest liar out there. his billions come from the 2 and 3 penny artificial spreads he makes in everyones retirement accounts. he isnt needed. worked just fine b4 him. he cant pick stocks anymore so he steals.
192 2019-04-16 21:57:32 I know theoretically the unprofitable story stocks should crash most but I suspect even in a sell-off there are plenty still willing to buy the story.
193 2019-04-16 21:55:56 I don’t recommend you select stocks.
194 2019-04-16 21:54:34 Gun deaths have declined radically over the past 100 years as well.  The reason it seems worse is the sensationalism that comes with every tragedy.
195 2019-04-16 21:52:44 Yeah TZ are not the broker to swing trades. Lol i left them for CP, but do miss not getting locates on HTB stocks.
196 2019-04-16 21:51:53 Big Nasdaq names are down, QQQ is up. It’s about quant flows not stocks.
197 2019-04-16 21:50:27 @petenajarian @jonnajarian Was the #CSCO and #QCOM unusual activity discussed elsewhere before the rise in the market price of these stocks? I might have missed it. $MRVL was mentioned at halftime show.
198 2019-04-16 21:49:54 Ok. Sometimes I just don't understand the action in indexes and how most of the growth stocks just follow. I was just both curious and anxious looking at that drop. :-/
199 2019-04-16 21:47:56 $SPY In this market there's a lot of mixed response depending on what stock and/or sector so I've been narrowing my focus to what's working ( to fewer stocks)
200 2019-04-16 21:47:48 Overall, I agree with you. One issue, #Crypto tokens/coins are not stocks. Their prices  are not tied to a company’s performance. Supply and demand will dictate the price of these assets. @binance success/profit/growth does not directly correlate to higher $bnb prices
201 2019-04-16 21:47:38 "For a little while... damn wench never stocks ingredients for a hot whiskey....

She'll never learn"
202 2019-04-16 21:46:10 For those investors that held through the spin the discount closed a bit at time of spin as well so not completely apples to apples comparison.

Lack of premium on control was disappointing 

I was referring to those holders of other Malone stocks with public market discounts

204 2019-04-16 21:45:15 Annual reminder: Player stocks don't "rise" and "fall" this close to the NFL Draft when nothing is happening. Perceived movement is either based on better information getting out, or lies gaining strength. That's it. It's perception, not reality.
205 2019-04-16 21:45:05 So, how are Stocks doing within Steel Industry?
206 2019-04-16 21:45:03 I did learn this, how to balance a checkbook, create a budget, make a new budget when circumstances change, do taxes, how stocks work, how credit/interest works, but I did it in middle school.  And I didn't think it was weird until no one else learned those things in school o.O

213 2019-04-16 21:40:40 You might wanna use a picture of a chinook for this story. 

Tough times for the rec sector on the south coast. As a whole they do a lot of salmon conservation to help ensure salmon stocks have a chance.
214 2019-04-16 21:40:20 It’s free to open up brokerage accounts and you usually just pay a small fee every time you buy something. Stocks are public infor so you can see how they move up and down over periods of times from a day, week, month and years.

217 2019-04-16 21:39:00 He added more debt to the country than Obama did in 8 years, You don't mention how much was spent in buying back stocks, nor how many were getting raises by contracts anyways. This is complete BS

220 2019-04-16 21:36:39 My noob interpretation is that when the plan to sell was made in november, he didn’t know what he knows today, and they wanted to clarify that in a way to protect gracias from accusations of dumping stocks with recent MNPI

232 2019-04-16 21:31:23 Sunshine? Why are all the fanatical pro-gun Tweeters so condescending? 

Ok, so you’re saying suicides don’t matter when talking gun deaths. That’s a brutal and cold mindset, but ok. Cars are heavily regulated, and deaths have declined dramatically by rate since the 1920s.

237 2019-04-16 21:29:18 I was wondering if he is holding a timer or a iPhone checking his stocks? The whole photo Iconic and disgusting
238 2019-04-16 21:28:12 Risk is back on the global menu and if you don’t believe so, you’ll probably be buying the next top in 2 years. I think stocks and crypto are going to keep rising until at least fall 2020. enjoy it while it lasts.
239 2019-04-16 21:27:20 You know what would be awesome is a portfolio tool that combs through your holdings, and holdings of each fund and calculates a portfolio carbon intensity + breakdown of funds that contribute to it. Don't know if the data is there for small cap and international stocks though?
240 2019-04-16 21:26:41 I’m pretty sure @B3_MillerValue looks at years instead of hours,weeks,months. I’m not sure young people can comprehend how AWFUL Amazon & Apple performed as stocks early in their evolution. Amazon in particular was called SCAMAZON routinely when referring to its “price action”.

243 2019-04-16 21:24:23 Honestly, don't use bump stocks. It's dodgy and dangerous, just get a permit for your automatic like normal people.
244 2019-04-16 21:24:22 Nice, we'll add it to the stocks.

249 2019-04-16 21:20:38 It’s to the point where they don’t even check. I saw someone on TV the other day and he was asked about a gold stock and his response was “gold stocks trade at large premiums to NAV” and the conversation stopped there.

253 2019-04-16 21:19:33 Well look at pasted stock far as how the stock market went for the company and how they sell and if their market in sales are up. Like apple, before they sell their new phone. The stocks go up. After they sell their new phone they shoot down. I made about $56 in apple stocks.
254 2019-04-16 21:17:46 I’m watching investors on YouTube, stocks, real-estate people give knowledge things like that and after all that I realize how small minded I was thinking and how stupid I once was say what you want but I’m in my own lane and I’m not letting things change it
255 2019-04-16 21:17:35 Commodities stocks are cyclical, which I would've thought was perfect for value investors. Too many chase high quality stocks you can own forever and can be run by a ham sandwich which crowds the investment. Everyone wants to be like Buffett.
256 2019-04-16 21:16:41 it’s dead to me now...I’m a boiling cauldron of enmity towards stocks I’ve sold out too early...I’m losing money but WTF ...at least I’ve got the white hot heat of my grudges to sustain me ...#emotionhasnoplaceininvesting 
257 2019-04-16 21:15:28 U can't start Jones smalling and young in the back leaving dalot out who is a number 2 and u expect barca not to punish us. Plus how does lukaku not start in this match.  Ole should pull up his stocks or else he will follow in mourhino's footsteps Edwoodward is on e wheel

261 2019-04-16 21:11:59 Let me drop some knowledge on ya, if we went balls out against the glazers they’d sell up! They scare easy, they rely on stocks and they don’t need bad press to mess with that! They’d run away!! But for 14 years we’ve done FUCK ALL- that’s the real shame of this fan base!
262 2019-04-16 21:11:48 Thats why Donald and gang need to bubble up stocks because thats the only way out of this mess

266 2019-04-16 21:10:39 Some of those recommendations are worth listening to. I can't say about my son who have no interest in stocks. Oh well, you can't win them all.
267 2019-04-16 21:09:58 It's awesome stuff and that's amazing.
I was thinking as a next step for Rhys' stock fun. Like the etching on shotguns, he could pyrograph stocks to give an awesome style/design element.
His craftsmanship is 100% there. So figured it a possible next step. What do you think?

273 2019-04-16 21:06:28 This statement was released in hopes that the stocks don’t plummet. Netflix has owned the streaming space for quite a while. The fact that Disney own the rights to Marvel, Starwarz, and Fox will present plenty of leverage against @netflix.

When you read positive ones do you take note or you dispute it?

Is that bad news?
Remember self-fulfilling prophesy.

345 2019-04-16 20:32:37 Billions and trillions of buybacks. The Fed doesn't have to do anything and stocks will stay buoyant yet they chose to add fuel to fire and for such a long time. Such reckless public policy it is mind-boggling. #EndTheFed
346 2019-04-16 20:32:35 Tom Price probably shorted some gene tx stocks after resigning.

358 2019-04-16 20:22:06 Well, you seem young enough to wait a decade or two, so keep buying stocks for the long term growth and dividends. By the time they are full grown men, they'll have that portfolio. Teach them about stocks from now.

370 2019-04-16 20:20:05 World stocks higher: Europe +.3%; US +.1%. US investors still evaluating 1Q earnings that are mixed so far. The -4% consensus forecast is about double my view. Investors seem ready to move beyond 1Q and look to better earnings later this year, more inline with 2+% GDP-growth.

465 2019-04-16 19:30:51 There is no way to prove it. Take out suicides and there were over double the number of car deaths than guns. Heck add in deaths by exhaust fumes and deaths of children playing in cars, left in cars, those ran over by cars to be fair.

471 2019-04-16 19:27:43 We should also hold federal and state agencies accountable to any environmental laws with climate aspects that are already on the books, for example the U.S. Forest Service, which manages one of the biggest carbon stocks in the world.

482 2019-04-16 19:24:07 Every hiccup will be a buy opportunity in stocks because the next step for the Fed is to monetize coporate debt. When the market prices that in, we will see 3500 in ES. December sell-off gave Powell PTSD, he is now all-in.
483 2019-04-16 19:23:44 So far: "Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns" by Bulkowski, "How to Trade In Stocks" by Livermore, and "Trading in the Zone" by Douglas.

484 2019-04-16 19:23:18 If you’re looking for a short on stocks, this has been a pretty decent performer compared to some types of dedicated short products like SH. Seems to produce a lower drag over time. But could probably use a rebrand...strategic growth?

504 2019-04-16 19:15:45 Agreed on a relative basis, stocks and bond proxies have become much more attractive.

But if the retail consumer spending continues to decline, I believe that it has been caused by the rate increases. They may be small, but with this amount of debt, it matters.

506 2019-04-16 19:14:47 Technical analysis works. I was a buyer if stock closed on the HOURLY above $42.60. Did not happen once, and all the stocks strength was sold into. Still waiting to be a buyer at SMA200.

Somebody just starting out might get a better understanding of markets and flow while trading penny stocks vs diving head first with large cap stock I guess, as long as you dont dump your whole saving account into the learning process
517 2019-04-16 19:08:14 No. Look at the 1970s. Look at the '00s. The dollar collapsed during both periods. How did stocks do? On the other hand, hard assets tend to do well. If you purchased a house in 1971 and 2001 you would have done well, and still been ahead in 2008.

523 2019-04-16 19:03:55 2.6% 10-year isn't that competitive vs. stocks, and mortgage rates are low enough that people are still benefiting from refinancing.

624 2019-04-16 18:10:44 What about bump stocks?  Thanks to the @NRA a piece of plastic is now considered a "machine gun".  It isn't "Regulated".  It's ILLEGAL.  Felony.  Don't pass go.  Go straight to jail.
625 2019-04-16 18:10:35 Onward and upward. I agree with you.  A lot of things happening and money coming in.

626 2019-04-16 18:10:00 Bit off-topic but it's occurred to me ESG is the ultimate "Linda the Bank Teller" example for investors. Reducing the universe of potential stocks shouldn't outperform the broader set (conjunction fallacy). What say the behavioral gurus? @danielcrosby @daniel_egan @brianportnoy

640 2019-04-16 18:03:43 When will the #Democrats ever stop making money shorting Healthcare stocks, I remember the @HillaryClinton scam in the 90's and they still keep doing it. They must have a massive short fund, linked to their Twitter accounts.

705 2019-04-16 17:31:55 Stocks are a store of wealth. Put them up, so later on in life your family can benefit. They are also a way to ensure funding, if you ever need it since they can be used as collateral.

730 2019-04-16 17:22:30 ESG investing is marketed as having impact.

799 2019-04-16 16:55:41 & sequence of returns risks for diversified portfolios is vastly overstated. As 70s taught us, its MAGNITUDE of returns that is the real risk.

824 2019-04-16 16:45:18 Yes, btw, I did used to work for Netflix.  They were an okay company to work for.  Until their upper management decided to shit all over themselves.  They pissed people off, their stocks tanked, they laid a bunch of people off, laid low and eventually people came back.

831 2019-04-16 16:41:25 Ok, let me rephrase it. Stocks up from the OPEN means today's opening print which can be different from yesterday's closing print. For example $BABA yday's close 183.07, it is up from the close. Opening print 185.35, it is down from the open
832 2019-04-16 16:40:53 Not enough to keep up with inflation. The gap between wealth and poverty keeps growing because corporations are buying back stocks instead of paying their employees a living wage.  Minimum wage was increased by Dems. GOP votes against it. Look it up.

842 2019-04-16 16:38:00 That's a lot like picking stocks though; you only know if you read the situation correctly in retrospect, most of what you need to know is hidden, the choice that's most accessible is the risk/return mix.
843 2019-04-16 16:37:27 I'd go one step further. There are TOO MANY bears out there. That's why stocks so supported. I'm old enough to know that until you get full capitulation & pull nearly every bear off the sidelines, melt-ups are indeed the more likely next move. That's why they're called "bubbles."

1. Trading is a probability game.
2. In order to win, you need to have a trading plan with positive expectancy.
3. Let your winning stocks run.
4. Cut your losses quickly and move on to the next trade.
5. Strictly follow your money management rules.
6. Use stops.
917 2019-04-16 16:05:38 Does anyone else find it ironic I posted about a pause in the upside yesterday, and today all the headlines are about a possible melt up in stocks?  we are not looking for a major correction, just an consolidation period after Tech has ALREADY melted up.
918 2019-04-16 16:05:37 People mustn’t miss that we have different circumstances today. Back then, money was valueless, and also there were no goods in shelves. Currently, we have a multi currency, stocks of goods in shops and warehouses..
919 2019-04-16 16:05:04 To be totally honest, I don’t like RESPs. The ones that lock you in and don’t give you your money back if your kid doesn’t go to school are fucked. The RESP is open but I put all their money in a TFSA. Stocks will be purchased in the next year or two.

927 2019-04-16 16:02:35 This was true up until 3 weeks ago. Rates have moved up significantly since hiting 2.4% on the 10y.

Rates and stocks can't go up together at this time. My 2 cents.
928 2019-04-16 16:02:21 The magnitude of the moves and the steady advance is exactly what we saw in 1999. There have been much more insane moves in special stocks but $TIGR with 180% in 4 weeks pretty much resembles the everyday life in late 1999.
929 2019-04-16 16:00:37 I've done this by accident before not realising. I felt I deserved a night in the stocks.

963 2019-04-16 15:47:20 That’s my take too.  $LHS is now fighting for market share and the more big MSOs that enter the valuation goes down.  I still think it’s trading at a deep discount.  Actually sold some other stocks to add to $LHS as I believe sale is imminent.  I can see a 1.30-1.50 deal for $LHS

965 2019-04-16 15:46:49 I use price action trails on primary trends. Problem with using % is every stock will have its own volatility so using fixed % will be loose on low beta and tight on high beta. Better to match to the stocks normal action and outside the noise

986 2019-04-16 15:37:50 9:31 AM : Stocks have started the day slightly higher. The Dow is +98.24 at 26,483,01 and the S&P 500 is +8.23 at 2,913,81. Mortgage Bonds are -5bp at 102.41. via @mbsHighway
987 2019-04-16 15:37:44 The corporation bought back their own stocks , made profits and what did income rise ? 3 to 4 percent. So we had yield inversion, 6.5 mil
988 2019-04-16 15:37:11 And if a company is buying back stocks, the upper leaders are not getting that income from dividends at a 10% tax rate. And employees that own stock get a boost in their share price. So society actually gets more from more taxes. If that money is used as bonuses/pay it's not.
989 2019-04-16 15:36:38 Mortgage Bonds continue on their path of least resistance, lower, while US Stocks continue to churn higher just below all-time highs. Solid

You should declare the income. The Government will allow you to use some for your defense Lawyers when you're tried for Treason. 
993 2019-04-16 15:35:42 The stock market has been disconnected from the real economy since a long time. It is fueled by central bank balance sheets, the govt fiscal deficits (at all levels), and the promise of low rates for a long time.

1121 2019-04-16 14:43:55 An observation on $COUP - it ran and got stuffed into 100 yesterday. No surprise, no volume. The bullish signal is that it did not collapse afterwards, like stocks often do. COUP's last 2 attempts at 100 were stuffed and triggered big sell offs-- Point being, it's now ready!
1122 2019-04-16 14:43:43 I think the easy days are over. They have some gas left. But the valuation must come down to reality. Eventually all stocks get to a lower PE. Like 20.

Yeah they can print and pump the stocks but you get paid in USD.

1239 2019-04-16 13:55:37 Canadian bank stocks don't have to be the "best" investment. They have paid growing dividends reliably and have appreciated well. They are not loved but regularly appear on "value" investing recommendations.

1335 2019-04-16 13:17:55 Why do most paid trading gurus state that RISK MGMT is the most important aspect for the new trader to learn... then go about teaching them first how to attempt to trade low float penny stocks? (the hardest thing to trade often)

1388 2019-04-16 12:46:26 Do all Canadians own stocks? Do they primarily invest in American stock? I’m curious. Let’s use a fuel metaphor. Our cars are using unleaded fuel these days, less powerful than leaded & the cost probably lowers the profit, but better for air quality for majority of people.
1389 2019-04-16 12:46:02 The bill is unpopular since the tax cuts are arbitrary and much of the tax cut is “imputed”. Eg., whats your assumption of the incidence of the corporate tax cut?  I don’t think I felt the fall in corporate taxes even though I own lots of stocks
1390 2019-04-16 12:45:56 It seems like a lot of value investors don’t always look in every sector as well. I hate that I am finding value in commodities stocks because it means I have to own them. I have heard lots of value investors say they will never own them.

1422 2019-04-16 12:30:03 Patience is required while you Invest in Stocks and build a portfolio.

But same patience will kill you if you Trade in Stock Markets.

In Trading you need Speed, as the price will not go as you expect it to so, as the Underlying stocks which drives are Index are too many.
1423 2019-04-16 12:28:00 Only few stocks in headline Indices are moving up.
No such upmoves felt yet in the individual portfolios.
We have to wait and see, whether the broader market is going to surge or the Indices will fall steeply..

Anyway thanks for the wonderful app though!
1816 2019-04-16 06:17:40 it is a good article and worth reading in full.

the damage we are doing to the environment to the rapidly depleting stocks of key mineral resources and productive agricultural land, makes us realise just exactly what the word “unsustainable” actually means
1817 2019-04-16 06:17:10 New to the game. Just wondering what determines “leading stocks” and how could you find them. Are they stocks that are staying flat/rising during index corrections?

They've been investing in stocks/shares. Usually dealing with unethical companies.
1822 2019-04-16 06:10:44 Perfect stats @jayeshkhilnani. How much percentage did all these stocks rally up/down?
1823 2019-04-16 06:09:04 Give $500,000 to my parents for them to spend how they want to(let’s hope they spend it usefully), then invest $300,000 into stocks,bonds, properties, etc. Then pay off student debt, and last save the rest and spend wisely on having a good time every now and then.
1824 2019-04-16 06:07:45 Japan and China will make it easier for investors in each country to buy each other's stocks by cross-listing exchange-traded funds as early as next month, translating a commitment to closer financial ties into action, Nikkei has learned.

1836 2019-04-16 05:56:55 I don’t see the value of sitting on 20% cash for long periods if I can find stocks with expected returns of 10-15%+. It seems like a very expensive bet on a bear market, and there are better ways to prepare for that - diversity of industry/country exposure & tactical rebalancing.

1905 2019-04-16 04:50:05 That’s true actually. Still bad policy. If you want to tax retirees why be so selective about it? If they’ve paid tax improperly why are they not due a refund?

1963 2019-04-16 03:45:21 Jason, I know I’d love to just have an over the shoulder view of ALL your screens and the process you go through each morning as you search for stocks, pick them, then what you’re looking at (time frames included) when you decide your entry, exit and stop/lose point.

2045 2019-04-16 02:48:11 He only cares about stock valuation, an artificial number that responds to a fly dying. Stocks are not GDP and do not enter in the trade equation. They just measure people's feelings towards something. They crash when the economy crashes, not the other way around.
2046 2019-04-16 02:48:11 There's this young guy who talks about stocks & has about 200k subs. He showed us his YouTube earnings & he makes around $12k per month purely from YouTube. Because even a video from 3 years ago can still get views & keep generating earnings and of course 200k subs is a lot.
2047 2019-04-16 02:46:38 'Platforms can censor speech'

Platforms can censor speech based on safety, echoing your first tweet about the law. Which we agree. They cannot censor based on sheer OPINION, then they become publishers. They are then open to litigation, and stocks would crash overnight.

2055 2019-04-16 02:39:01 I tell people about stocks because I want to help them. I gain nothing financially from people learning how to trade stocks. If I can help someone up, that’s what I’m gone do.
2056 2019-04-16 02:38:57 If you can’t trust the market then the truth is that you can’t trust yourself. Lack of trust is an expectation of wrongdoing, but only you can wrong yourself by incorrectly managing risk.

2086 2019-04-16 02:15:13 $Lyft is overvalued overhyped stock. The problem isn't that you missed a call. It's that you actively play part in media circus aimed at hyping up stocks. Fake news very much alive here. SEC should be looking into how IPOs are opened. Only winners were owners & investment banks.
2087 2019-04-16 02:14:51 OUTERTECH CIRCLE stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
2088 2019-04-16 02:14:37 I'm a bit frustrated, id prefer to see U stocks closing on highs.  that being said I've used the weakness to add more CCJ and weaker juniors.  if CCJ dumps 15% from here over the next week I might lighten up and think harder as I'm overweight that being said this uncertainty

2090 2019-04-16 02:13:03 Though all are important but 5th can't be ignored as preached by many biggies. In Iran Market it matters a lot for those who hold stocks for months only

2092 2019-04-16 02:12:21 Putting mom to bed, telling her about what I'd been learning from Business Wars.

She laughed & told me, "My grandfather (with the oil company) once bought a bunch of stocks in an unknown company. His wife had a shitfit about it & had him sell.

...it was Xerox. Fucking DAMMIT!"
2093 2019-04-16 02:12:10 Every single one of my stocks are at a record low 

Beautiful.
2094 2019-04-16 02:11:42 I would put it in my cash account and buy dividend stocks and use the quarterly to flip,

2101 2019-04-16 02:05:55 Starting to make a much bigger push into Chinese companies. China sentiment and slowing growth pushed stocks lower recently. Long term, there’s huge growth
2102 2019-04-16 02:03:35 Yes, 10/40ema and 20/40ema work but don't beat B&H for most stocks. Which is why I B&H and hedge market risk with #NQ_F shorts
2103 2019-04-16 02:03:06 I'd give my tithes for church, take care of my family bills, donate some to charity of cancer, children hospital, stocks for family future and saving.
2104 2019-04-16 02:01:47 I follow stocks but I have no idea on how to trade stocks. What steps do I take?

2107 2019-04-16 02:00:06 I own a baker's dozen high growth stocks and trade in and out of them on the 20/40ema cross. Catch most of the big moves on upside and avoid a little of the downside. Doesn't beat holding but easier to sleep at night. Any thoughts?
2108 2019-04-16 01:59:16 Anyone interested in learning about stocks ?
2109 2019-04-16 01:57:31 Friends. Planning to Clone Successful Investors Portfolio?

2110 2019-04-16 01:56:47 European stocks rose moderately on Monday after progress in the US-China trade talks buoyed sentiment and investors grew optimistic about the next batch of corporate earnings.
2111 2019-04-16 01:56:14 first, find reliable stocks, and then use reliable technical indicators, indicators may fail but reliable stocks may lead to higher success rates.

2113 2019-04-16 01:54:21 There could be stocks with embarrassing pictures on them.
2114 2019-04-16 01:53:50 US stocks fell on Monday as the latest results from the banks failed to thrill investors, who were looking to get a sense of the health of the broader economy.
2115 2019-04-16 01:53:35 I wonder how close we are to competitive QE.

2119 2019-04-16 01:51:22 It’s quite impressive, really. @ARKInvest & @GerberKawasaki have quite a gig going for them. Sell ETFs, sprinkle them with a couple dabs of bull market momentum stocks & *BAM* you’re a stock operator. Perhaps it’s natural selection. Someone is knowingly giving them their money.
2120 2019-04-16 01:50:53  are you joking?

Unemployment numbers are fudged, cutting millions off food stamps, disability, & cutting full time to part time to make extra openings is FAKING IT.

Stock market, yea let’s celebrate the 1% who control 95% of stocks inflating a bubble for profit.

2121 2019-04-16 01:49:39 Donald, 
The steel industry added 2,400 jobs last year, an increase of just over 1%. Employment in the industry is still down about 43% since 1990. My steel stocks are unimpressive
2122 2019-04-16 01:47:43 Curious. I'm not sure my hospital still stocks it.
2123 2019-04-16 01:47:43 You're going to sit here and let materialistics bring you down? Ight imma invest that $300 Gucci belt into stocks and watch it gross over 150k in 5 years.

2128 2019-04-16 01:44:27 My fave donuts are from the gas station by my house and I just found out the company that stocks them has a physical bakery and storefront like 15 minutes from me AND they do BOGO happy hour every day

2130 2019-04-16 01:43:40 $cron end of week $14...... Then see $10 soon. Every week less $1. PPL could lose some $$$. Sharktanks never lost$$$. Pumps and dumps. So if stocks up $0.20 per better sales it. Not holding longer.. I MADE $0 32 sold $17.02.
2131 2019-04-16 01:43:37 You may well have identified a useful factor -- jump on and post accordingly!

We love it when the investment case for any of our ranked stocks are challenged. It's the best way to refine and improve ideas -- and, ultimately, improve returns.

It's called Strawman for a reason 
2132 2019-04-16 01:43:32 I confess I'm a dummie abt #StockMarket, #WallStreet & high finance. It seems to me there has 2 be #InsiderTrading daily or else markets don't move

Isn't there always insider trading transpiring for Buying & Selling stocks? 

So he's a GOPeSnazzy outfit your avatar has on.
2133 2019-04-16 01:42:32 Bullshit! Buying back stocks raises the stock values for the many millions of Americans with 401k or IRA accounts. It has nothing to do with Execs getting richer. Your lies about  so called tax scam will haunt you big time before 2020 election.
2134 2019-04-16 01:42:27 US stocks near all-time highs. Earnings season kicks in full bloom. Fed president says economy is strong.
2135 2019-04-16 01:41:58 Investors have lost money in the markets. The Sensex may be up but the rise masks a much broader weakness; 70% of the stocks with a market capitalisation of over Rs 1,000 crore have lost value in the last one year 2017-18
2136 2019-04-16 01:41:46 In theory all IPO’s of stocks that don’t make money should tank like $LYFT.  Basic accounting if there is no E in PE ratio. Hype goes so far
2137 2019-04-16 01:41:23 I've started investing in stocks. 
Beef, Chicken, and Vegetable..... 

One day I hope to be a bouillonaire.
2138 2019-04-16 01:40:11 I’d much rather celebrate you investing $5k on investments such as a dp for real estate/ purchase in stocks then a pair of luxury brand shoes/accessories. I’ll never understand why people praise the most minimal purchases with the lowest to none ROI.
2139 2019-04-16 01:39:16 volatility is always a factor when you spent your life trying to build for the future.  I'd rather have some safety than rely on a crystal ball that might just be dead wrong when I'm in desperate need for it to be right. #Investing #stocks
2140 2019-04-16 01:39:12 Great share. The buildup of corporate debt is something that could have wide-spread effects on consumption because people hold stocks in and are employed by debt holders.
2141 2019-04-16 01:38:41 Stocks, flipping items, photography
2142 2019-04-16 01:37:24 I disagree, honestly. People keep acting like this is untoward behavior, but stocks get delisted from exchanges all the time. $MGT got delisted on the back of some mess with NASDAQ not digging Mcafee. It happens. Shit companies do gets them delisted. This is no different.
2143 2019-04-16 01:37:19 Of course and for good reason for corporations that is. They want to keep those tax cuts and record profits so they can continue to buy back stocks.....They don't want to lose the #trickledowneconomics
2144 2019-04-16 01:37:16 That's good, good job for being dedicated and I don't even know how I found out about penny stocks 
2145 2019-04-16 01:35:48 I used to work for a guy who told me "Peter, stocks go up 90% of the time".   Of course with that knowledge he never out-performed SPX........
2146 2019-04-16 01:34:04 STOCKS!!!
2147 2019-04-16 01:31:47 Right thanks for the information. Do u mind me asking what stocks you hold?

2150 2019-04-16 01:28:19 What's that? The Fed's have zero interest in whether stocks or high or low. They look at the US Economy as a whole. Yes, including the price of fish, and kleenex for wiping  the tears.
2151 2019-04-16 01:27:35 Any stocks ?
2152 2019-04-16 01:27:12 16.5 years is a long time, and stocks have outperformed long treasuries by 500 bps over *that* time period.

2158 2019-04-16 01:24:21 The stocks I believe have done really well I think because of the outlook and confidence they have of a UCP government taking over..

go up, hiring goes down, raises are stopped, 401ks are hurt (that’s you! Not the rich, your 401k is in stocks). Every left wing idea has the opposite affect because of.. common sense! Raise min wage, guess what, the least educated lose jobs to the more educated or robots-
2164 2019-04-16 01:22:17 Federal spending on “debt interest” is the reconciliation of Treasuries that have been issued over the past 30 years. This is all money we’ve pumped in to the financial markets that was used to buy stocks and other securities. Public Debt = Private Savings

2181 2019-04-16 01:13:26 I was at work with my boss just talking about life and stocks. I love that I’m able to hold a conversation with people of all ages. Intelligent conversations at that. Now I just gotta get the talking to cute girls part down 
2182 2019-04-16 01:11:52 I'm studying hun, but according to Joel, Tim's dad I'm ready to trade haha but I'll just observe first. Soo I've been paper trading instead. 

I'm close to 28 years old, and never ever thought of trading stocks but I'm Keen now and pretty much invested in it.
2183 2019-04-16 01:08:45 JFC. But what other stocks does he like tho?
2184 2019-04-16 01:08:15 waiting for my stocks to go from 100 to 100k. is a k behind 100 really that much to ask for?
2185 2019-04-16 01:07:47 Always amazes me how twitter affects their trading so much. Why are they so bothered about what someone/anyone says on twitter. Unless of course you use twitter to make money by pumping stocks.

2190 2019-04-16 01:04:40 it will never work that way and not as simple as you make it sound. politicians will always find a way to make money, whether with insider info on stocks, etc. how do you stop that? we should definitely cut ridiculous spending, tho

2194 2019-04-16 01:02:59 Dosent have to be in that area . I just like to play gold stocks thus time of the season . Alot of Jr has big potienal . The big 4 is finding it harder and harder to find high grade mines . Which they are now mining 1.5g/t average .
2195 2019-04-16 01:02:51 I never considered this because I don't generally look for a new stock every month; prefer to only own a few stocks. I caught onto the annual cyclical nature of the food services industry a few years ago and MTY happens to have the best growth fundamentals right now.
2196 2019-04-16 01:02:25 Best prices on Blood pressure monitors. Great deal whilst stocks last.
2197 2019-04-16 01:01:29 Of course I think that stocks should outperform bonds. Therefore, you have made an argument, in the absence of other information, to buy more equities / stay invested in equities, not to buy bonds.
2198 2019-04-16 01:01:14 He will wind up in Jail ,, if he could use those great marketing skill in a boiler room for stocks ,, it’s just as bad ,, not putting a gun to a suckers head but a total  negative impact on every one he cons & humanity as a whole,,,
2199 2019-04-16 01:00:38 Strategy to adjust portfolio while market may volatile in Election.
1) list 3 stocks from major sectors
2) Calculate RoE by Dupont model, pick highest. 
3) Check #NimblrTA retracement level & cci34 M
4) Place buy order 30days validity for 25% qntity at ema55 w or w restatement

2207 2019-04-16 00:57:11 At the rate they're going, stocks may well make up the gap by the end of 2030, but given the higher volatility I think most want to see at least 300 bps of annual outperformance over fixed income alternatives by the time you've run the experiment for 3 decades.
2208 2019-04-16 00:57:00 A winning attitude will help you move on from your mistakes. A losing attitude will keep you stuck in a cycle of regret, pity, and destructive criticism.

2215 2019-04-16 00:52:34 If you don’t take responsibility for your trading results then you have “nothing to learn” because the results were “caused by the market.” The same poor results will continue to pour in.

2216 2019-04-16 00:50:49 If crypto exchanges can give back 10-20% of their earnings every month to their token holders in crypto assests, i guess this would hasten the crypto mass adoption and would definitely kill banks/stocks exchnges in the future.. Love to spend those earnings..

2221 2019-04-16 00:47:43 Here’s an idea. Don’t invest in stocks. Weird how gambling your money with yellow belly crook scumbags isn’t working out for ya! How people trust Wall Street is the biggest con in the history of mankind.
2222 2019-04-16 00:47:33 Winning traders don’t try to follow their rules, they DO follow their rules. If you have to TRY to follow your rules then that means you are having internal resistance, otherwise you would just simply do it.

2227 2019-04-16 00:43:44 The caveat to this is that the people at the top are hoarding the money unless they are altruistic. Stock buy backs and paying CEO's with stocks are some of the biggest flaws.

2244 2019-04-16 00:32:13 "Sustained recent underperformance" is definitely not how I'd describe stocks vs bonds. Moreover, underperformance of equities, if I believe that equities should earn a risk premium, means that I should be buying more equities and selling bonds.

2255 2019-04-16 00:24:33 Mr Bill Weld, of course we need 6 more years of this Presidency.
Just take a look to economy and stocks, also look around the Socialists who wants to run to White House, you should be worried about that!!
Just relax because MAGA will be 2024.
If you don’t like it!
Just quick!!

2258 2019-04-16 00:23:56 I've invested in penny stocks more reliable than a lot of fursuit makers in this fandom.

A scary number of makers run their business like a ponzi scheme and end up taking on 2 years of backlogged queue and spend all the money before they can afford to buy the materials later.
2259 2019-04-16 00:23:16 May stocks p?
2260 2019-04-16 00:23:01 The same thing happened during Bush 43 when taxes were cut. Corps used "savings" to buyback stocks. That didn't work out well. Why can Reps learned from history?
2261 2019-04-16 00:22:57 Alot of talk about when to sell in this coming #uranium  for me I have my own valuations of the stocks I own. If they reach that number I take out my initial investment then play the rest by ear. Protect my downside, try and max my upside. At that point your playing with $

2264 2019-04-16 00:19:27 My plan is to NOT panic and continue to buy stocks on sale, as they say. We’ll see how it works out when actual emotions are involved. It’s easy to say it but completely different to live through it. Fingers crossed!

2266 2019-04-16 00:18:15 I wanted Democrats out of office, i really didnt expect my President to be one of the best, for real. Please get the GSEs out of conservatorship before any recession, I have been working for 40 years, and my common stocks have gone nowhere for 11 years now. I need some real help.
2267 2019-04-16 00:17:59 So basically they just figured on their end at a super high level that my stocks were moving with me and I didn’t quit. It’s fucking weird.
2268 2019-04-16 00:16:48 Your plans will bankrupt America and cause a major recession. I’m planning on moving my stocks to a safer area, if you win. Recession will be right around the corner.

2270 2019-04-16 00:16:29 This is the kind of dumb stuff that makes us laughing stocks. Smh
2271 2019-04-16 00:14:59 I don't dispute that stocks were the place to be during the American century for total returns...my question, from a Bayesian standpoint, is how much sustained recent underperformance is enough to challenge faith in the existence/magnitude of the ERP on a forward looking basis.

2273 2019-04-16 00:12:54 You need to cow-ntersue him and make sure he’s severly punished, in public. I recommend the stocks on the national mall for at least  week in addition to other penalties. Appropriate eh? ;)

2280 2019-04-16 00:07:26 The last time I saw the shorts so reckless was in 2008, ... I saw bank stocks with a PE of 2! ... Just after the crash, I made $200,000 during the European crisis. The lady lost one million out of two million, and I was pleased to get her back some after the dust settled.

2282 2019-04-16 00:04:23 I was referring to how restaurants all prep their mise-en-place in advance. I've worked in the industry for 10years, things are made and frozen. Stocks, soups, bar snacks, desserts etc well in advance. Not fresh products and proteins.
2283 2019-04-16 00:01:37 To even think that we ran a correlation analysis on those stocks. Smh Nigeria my country 
2284 2019-04-16 00:01:33 Stocks very rarely break and hold 10c on their first attempt. Considering 90m shares came out of escrow, it's holding up remarkably well. No price action and below avg vol is preferred to form a strong base here.
2285 2019-04-16 00:01:13 They were almost certainly NOT second-guessed by their shareholders for liquidating these stakes. They would be second-guessed by their shareholders for NOT liquidating them.
Prevailing wisdom was that corps have core competencies & rolling the dice on stocks is not among them.
2286 2019-04-16 00:00:01 Good stuff. Not as compelling when one looks outside us stocks, which are anomalous from a historical equity risk premium perspective. That said, go 'merica
