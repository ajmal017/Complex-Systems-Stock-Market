12 2018-01-06 23:58:39 Well of course the check engine light just came on in my truck and the oil pressure gauge maxed out... 
13 2018-01-06 23:58:37 So far not thrilled about the scent but it's not bad seems to work well. I think I'll stick with this over the oil
14 2018-01-06 23:58:28 I am so upset rn. My dumb self who hasn't flown in 8 years forgot that I'm not suppose to have liquids/gel in my backpack when boarding so they threw away my $16 Shea moisture coconut oil, my big can of Eco styling gel and my lotion.

42 2018-01-06 23:56:55 Volkswagen  I came for an oil change that was under warranty and my tires were so bad they wouldn’t even rotate them 
43 2018-01-06 23:56:47 My face is like fucking oil city today. Wtf.
44 2018-01-06 23:56:41 Put a commemorative oil derrick on Spa Beach to celebrate the Trump economy effect & nix the artsy fartsy million dollar weather sock brainstorm.
45 2018-01-06 23:56:26 Olive oil?
46 2018-01-06 23:56:14 When I lived in PA I suffered the same. Try coconut oil for your cuticles too 
47 2018-01-06 23:56:11 Srikant and SriRam bhai , Can't you understand Pappu @OfficeOfRG can't understand these things, some Pidi has tweeted on his behalf and you are burning midnight oil to make him understand.

50 2018-01-06 23:55:47 Winter 71/72 really sucked in western Canada.  We were joking then about getting all the oil out of the ground and back in the atmosphere where it belongs.  Another one off the bucket list.
51 2018-01-06 23:55:47 i love oil diffusers. candles more or less okay :3
52 2018-01-06 23:55:26 with oil and nothing on right??
53 2018-01-06 23:55:26 If you like sea food go to Pepes in New Haven and get the clam apizza. It.s clams olive oil and garlic.
54 2018-01-06 23:55:25 @Nomiku I tried the shrimp with herbs and chili recipe. The oil was delicious for bread but found the shrimp really oily to eat even after de shelling.any recommendations?
55 2018-01-06 23:55:06 The people of Alaska want and need those oil drilling jobs. They don't have a rich Daddy to help pay their mortgage.
56 2018-01-06 23:54:53 This is surprising news. I actually really don't like the dip cups. I'm so sorry I cannot join you with that shot. But yes. The garlic oil. I want to put it on all of my food forever.
57 2018-01-06 23:54:45 Would you believe I had a bowl of lentil soup for lunch? I added a bunch of sesame oil and hot chili oil. It was tolerable. The worst part of being vegan, as my brother once told me, is missing good desserts.

59 2018-01-06 23:54:38 It was so cold that the coconut oil in my hair stiffened 
60 2018-01-06 23:54:29 it apparently takes money and the skills of a snake oil salesman. You have been a poor leader, leaving congress to make up any laws that you don’t care whether they meet your requirements or citizens interest.
61 2018-01-06 23:54:27 Hope you get to feeling better. My sister is coughing up her lungs. Take 1000mg Vit. C, if you have it or a lot of orange juice or oranges. If you can get natural eucalyptus oil a little bit of it can help you breathe. Or go to Dollar tree & get $1 Vic's rub
62 2018-01-06 23:54:26 Wanted:someone to binge watch hours of chopped with. Must possess knowledge of cooking so can judge use of sesame oil whilst simultaneously never being able to cook well enough to be on this show.
63 2018-01-06 23:54:26 got coconut oil in my eye so now it’s like an out of focus camera ffs
64 2018-01-06 23:54:20 If the three wise men were to show up today, which is both my birthday and the Feast of the Epiphany, I'd want them to be bearing gold, heating oil, and whoopie pies... #Epiphany #HappyBirthday
65 2018-01-06 23:54:01 Yeah, like not intervening in Syria. Not saving Kurds. Not fixing the lead problem in Michigan. Allowing the largest oil disaster to go on unchecked for months.
66 2018-01-06 23:53:58 I'm happy for your youth. But, I can tell you, there has never been another that comes close. Until Melania.
67 2018-01-06 23:53:01 Bolt in your tires: $1000
Oil Change: $50
Happening right after Christmas: Priceless.
68 2018-01-06 23:52:54 A number of those things were outside of his control. Carter had minimal control over oil prices and he lifted price controls to ease shortages.
69 2018-01-06 23:52:26 This oil diffuser is really life.
70 2018-01-06 23:52:24 I was thinking like a roiling pot of water, or oil, lots of little bubbles. maybe one 2k texture and have the coords change every frame?
71 2018-01-06 23:52:22 All in caps, I see.
Leadership as in using the army to push a pipe through indigenous sacred land? NOT using the army to fix the largest oil spill ever, for months? NOT using the army to stop the problem in Syria? Sure. Great leader...NOT.
72 2018-01-06 23:52:16 Bought some sesame oil so I can have another go at making some wakame salad. Maybe I’ll do that tonight. Dried wakame doesn’t go bad, right?
73 2018-01-06 23:52:00 I don’t want to be beautiful like a magazine cover
I want to be beautiful like a pre raphaelite oil painting
74 2018-01-06 23:51:59 @steve_hanke prof Is the petro a way to disguise the delivery of oil, gold and diamond reserves to Russia, China, Iran and Cuba of Venezuela goverment?
75 2018-01-06 23:51:43 @PetroHome 

We signed a contract with you over a month ago with an estimated date of delivery of 12/19, nothing was delivered as we just found out our oil tank is empty. We have a 5 month old and a 3 year old as well as several pets. Been waiting with CS for 30 min, HELP NOW!!!
76 2018-01-06 23:51:39 2 Mega Lottery winners, Oil >$60? Houston’s gunna be a mad house.
77 2018-01-06 23:51:20 A bit of oil over the polish will help it dry a little quicker and be more forgiving to smudging. That said, it's gonna be rough!
78 2018-01-06 23:51:15 Wait. The garlic dip cup, the garlic parm, or the garlic oil. Asking for a friend.
79 2018-01-06 23:50:53 oil, oil everywhere and not a drop of water to drink...
80 2018-01-06 23:50:36 Canada added 36 crude oil rigs past week... it's going be very painful ledge
81 2018-01-06 23:50:32 でもそうか、物販が始まって、その人が買い物終わらない限りであいちゅできないのか……
82 2018-01-06 23:50:13 In fact, if anything this is saying the USA supports Venezuela by continuing to import their oil.  So please, just stop with the excuses and just face facts; Socialism destroyed business and productivity, and THAT'S why it fell flat on its face.
83 2018-01-06 23:49:58 Wish I could help figure out why the 7.3 is leaking oil so bad even tho we just replaced everything
84 2018-01-06 23:49:45 Oh God. The best thing  - a perfect baguette, a variety of cheeses and a bottle of perfectly paired wine. Add in a bit of herb infused olive oil too...heavenly.
85 2018-01-06 23:49:39 Why does tea trea oil smell like an old dusty grandpa
86 2018-01-06 23:49:34 I wonder what would happen if you ate, say, primarily cream, a bit of fish oil and pure fructose, with just enough protein and a multivitamin. Very low insulinogenic diet. I postulate you would not get usual MetSyn problems. Even with a relatively large amount of fructose.
87 2018-01-06 23:49:23 My parents get this all natural peanut butter and it’s pretty good, but it separates and you have to mix it. Well I was mixing it yesterday and the peanut oil on top splashed up into my eye. :(
88 2018-01-06 23:49:13 I asked my brother if he had lotion he said, “nah I use mineral oil I’m half-Hotep” does anyone need a brother? I’ll give him up free of charge
89 2018-01-06 23:49:10 True, too pampered with oil money. Rasa entitled for those benefits forever

91 2018-01-06 23:49:03 Off shore oil drilling. Feels terribly wrong.
92 2018-01-06 23:48:39 Surprising since some of the biggest names associated are lefties.
93 2018-01-06 23:48:36 Sure like pay medical bills since they lost healthcare, pay higher oil/gas prices since we sold our federal lands to oil boy, pay higher education taxes since federal funds were cut, pay highest taxes ever in 7 yrs to pay for corp & 1% PERM CUT

96 2018-01-06 23:48:08 The cable released by Wikileaks says "US Goals, objectives and resource management for Venezuela. 1. That Venezuela continue to supply a significant portion of our petroleum import and continue a moderate and responsible oil price position in OPEC"

103 2018-01-06 23:47:01 Obama won largely on the back of using far left progressive rhetoric which put Wall Street, the rich, and the oil industry as those deserving of blame. However, when he got into power and affected none of these things, he created a disaffected Democratic base.

113 2018-01-06 23:45:38 Carrot ginger soup instructions: chop maybe eight or ten carrots (about four cups chopped). Cook in olive oil with a couple tablespoons grated ginger and an onion. Add four cups of broth. (Mine was Better Than Bouillon vegetable.) Boil until soft. Stick blender. 1/2
114 2018-01-06 23:45:30 So I went to get a massage today and my massage therapist had a cold and spent the entire hour leaning over me and sniffling. There is very little that is quite as relaxing as laying naked on a table wondering whether the slimy liquid on your skin is oil or snot 
115 2018-01-06 23:45:27 Well we need lots of oil so rich jerks like you can fly around on private jets!
116 2018-01-06 23:45:16 True, but my question is:  why can't the broadcast media walk and chew gum at the same time?  Can't they cover BOTH the Wolff fallout AND the fact that our Atlantic Coast will be open to oil drilling - now relegated to the crawl at the bottom of the screen?
117 2018-01-06 23:45:06 The thing about off-shore oil drilling is that it is extremely expensive and therefore has to be profitable. Just because they CAN do it doesn't mean they WILL. As long as prices are low I am not sure they will.
118 2018-01-06 23:45:06 I CAN BREATHE AGAIN!!!! Peppermint oil in my diffuser came through in the clutch

122 2018-01-06 23:43:52 No no no. Hell no. Drip some olbas oil drops in a bowl of boiling water and inhale the steam under a towel (looks stupid - clears sinuses) then gently try to pop your ears.

125 2018-01-06 23:43:21 Kristi,  look deeply into wild oregano oil  it will fight off any cold and stop it in its tracks, and kills all bacteria.
And viruses in your body , just put five drops under your tongue and swallow.  When you feel a cold do this. It's so incredible.
126 2018-01-06 23:43:15 He’s a snake oil salesman.

129 2018-01-06 23:43:03 Nothing makes you feel like you know what you're doing like pouring oil in a pan.
130 2018-01-06 23:42:52 Is there a lower cost substitute? Tgere certainly are cheaper options for an oil diffusion pump.
131 2018-01-06 23:42:35 I’ve never oil painted before. Time to try something new!
132 2018-01-06 23:42:35 Bread And Circuses #Show Industrial Center Denver 3/31/18 We all need to focus on the positive as popular news is generally dark. Cast off your Juvenal discontent for a few hours of fun. Oil companies will NEVER retool to an earth-safe product! FYI The buskers ARE eighteen.

135 2018-01-06 23:42:10 I mean, wherever an oil change on my truck doesn’t take an Hour and a half.
136 2018-01-06 23:41:51 Not really tbh - but you are suggesting after Indy SNP are going to be able to increase Oil Tax Revenues by 4000%. Laughable. #justsaynaw #keepbritainbritain
137 2018-01-06 23:41:45 Right? Instead of civil rights abuses and shitting on native Americans, it's spilling gallons upon gallons of oil into the ground!!! 
What a difference a year makes....
138 2018-01-06 23:41:41 Salt, pepper, onion powder (very important), olive oil, cayenne pepper for spice.

141 2018-01-06 23:40:44 Went and got my oil changed today... I should've went to the car wash....
142 2018-01-06 23:40:39 @SenBillNelson Stand up to “Dirty Donald” Trump and the oil barons. Just say no to drilling in the Florida Gulf.#offshoredrilling
143 2018-01-06 23:40:31 It’s really good quality! I tried a sample of the mask from this line and it was amazingggg but I can’t afford it rn lol tbh I might just keep using this oil Bc I don’t want to risk messing up a good thing
144 2018-01-06 23:40:24 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
145 2018-01-06 23:40:20 that would be a guzzler...be worth it maybe when oil drops to $19 per barrel....?

147 2018-01-06 23:40:03 So I picked up my car. One tire had a nail in it and it was repairable. The tires got a heavy coating of bead sealer. The car was there overnight and there was no loss of air in tires. Oil was changed and antifreeze checked. I should be good now. 
148 2018-01-06 23:39:39 just put a bit of olive oil on n crawl in the oven makes my chips nice n golden

151 2018-01-06 23:38:24 Advocado Oil is great for so many things.
152 2018-01-06 23:38:18 My mom tried making something with coconut oil and telling me you can't even taste it nope
153 2018-01-06 23:37:57 Gotta love getting an oil change and having no oil the next day
154 2018-01-06 23:37:53 Corbyn has always embraced antisemitism. But his mealy mouthed pusillanimous 'I condemn all violence...kind of'. Has allowed him become the supreme snake oil merchant.
155 2018-01-06 23:37:51 It's time to go off progesterone in oil next week & I'm nervous..  Did going off meds go okay for you all?  Did your doctor wean you off?
156 2018-01-06 23:37:37 : This is vulgar  opulence of the novo riche. Like Arabs when they first struck oil .

159 2018-01-06 23:36:54 Do you change the oil?
160 2018-01-06 23:36:47 Simple explanation, this is the price of diversity and in the minds of those promoting it acceptable collateral damage to achieve goal.
161 2018-01-06 23:36:06 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
162 2018-01-06 23:36:03 Leave it to me to be a hour late to someone sweet cause i got coconut oil on my pants
163 2018-01-06 23:35:50  I feel you. I'm also a scaredy cat but like to read about scary stuff. We need to oil those hinges XD
164 2018-01-06 23:35:22 These both look like oil paintings, nice
165 2018-01-06 23:35:19 11. He didn’t open us up to oil drilling. Against the wishes of states who will be impacted. Didn’t take away state rights on marijuana. Or take away landmark status on sacred land.
166 2018-01-06 23:35:15 That is the result of the laissez faire capitalist system which much of the west has been brainwashed to believe always yields the optimum results. A corrupt leadership, oil firm executives and shareholders grow rich and the rest of us are left with scraps.
167 2018-01-06 23:35:06 Lemon bath bomb. Lemon essential oil. Bubbles. Try it.
168 2018-01-06 23:35:01 Good news is the oil companies no longer put aside money to pay for clean up either! Thanks for that new Tax bill @GOP

172 2018-01-06 23:34:37 Getting an oil change and having Tommy's ^^.
173 2018-01-06 23:34:26 Back then it was the oil -running-out scare. Guaranteed. At 50, and having read the enviro-panic books of the 1970s, you'll understand my current desire for a bit more thought.

175 2018-01-06 23:34:01 With @mikeyp121... do you still want some one to save you oil?

179 2018-01-06 23:33:31 Hey Gov;  NH has 18 miles of coast line and is adjacent to the southern edge of the North Sea fields. Seems to me that getting cheaper oil to NH, maybe even a refinery built to the finest, safest, most protective standards would be good for us, eh?!
180 2018-01-06 23:33:17 Who knows bro
181 2018-01-06 23:32:56 Somebody had to say it...
182 2018-01-06 23:32:26 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
183 2018-01-06 23:32:22 I was expecting an energy drain on keto but holy fuck I do not want to do anything
184 2018-01-06 23:32:19 Please protect our coastal waters, but also all our public lands.  Trump/Zinke are more interested in oil/gas/mining donor $$ than they are in clean water, clean air, wildlife.
185 2018-01-06 23:32:17 Nah coconut oil all the way.. you should know this
186 2018-01-06 23:32:11 @reicurran Recent years have brought a cascade of scandals at the United Nations, of which the wholesale corruption of the Oil-for-Food relief program in Iraq has been only the most visible. We still do not know the full extent of these debacles—the more sensational.....

188 2018-01-06 23:31:56 The U.S. govt is nothing more than a drug running cartel full of all the evil wicked things criminal thugs do like cover up for each other who even torture children in Satanic ritual abuse! It is evil and is going after innocent Americans over non-TBD Cannabis hemp oil!
189 2018-01-06 23:31:48 Why do you think the foolish virgins didn’t bring enough oil to last until the bridegroom came?
190 2018-01-06 23:31:30 i love when i go to bed with my face covered in rosehip oil and wake up with baby smooth oily skin...;,;..,

191 2018-01-06 23:31:06 Just finished rewatching Mad Max Fury Road again with my housemate. I both want to drink a huge glass of water, and smear oil across my forehead Furiosa style to prepare for the coming week.
192 2018-01-06 23:30:53 its only fair.  maybe Pukin will stop sending oil to north korea now.
193 2018-01-06 23:30:52 I would of made them give me free oil changes and car washes for two years
194 2018-01-06 23:30:48 Tatcha.
My entire skincare line is one step cleansing oil, rice enzyme powder & gold beauty oil
195 2018-01-06 23:30:46 After a full week of working out and working on cars today with oil and grease, I need to do a deep cleansing on my face. I need to cop pore strips and a face mask. Shit is no bueno. Plus, I need a haircut too and facial hair line up 
196 2018-01-06 23:30:45 Well oil be damned. What’s de big idear
197 2018-01-06 23:30:30 Sponsors such as Nike by all accounts with the Phil transfer and oil money are what's wrong. It'll be the fans who have to pay inflated prices for a match tickets, merch etc that will prop it all up in the end.
198 2018-01-06 23:30:15 Hey Watters,  you should report on how Trump & Congress is knocking down a provision of Dodd-Frank that requires Oil and Gas companies to report payments to foreign governments.  Does this also knock out Foreign Corrupt Practices Act too?  Shell and Eni in litigation over this.
199 2018-01-06 23:30:15 @MarcJSpearsESPN just shamed cancer patients who use cannabis oil to east pain and also told them to just "move to California"
200 2018-01-06 23:30:14 no because oil and water dont mix they just separate
201 2018-01-06 23:30:08 It was good enough for Alaska but not for Maine? Are you going to stand back and let Big Oil ruin America's beautiful coasts? Someone needs to have balls to call for Zinke's resignation before America burns down.
202 2018-01-06 23:29:53 Came to get an oil change and blah its boring
203 2018-01-06 23:29:48 I know a lot , and I mean A LOT , about cars. but don’t ask me to change my car’s oil cus I don’t fucking know how to do that. 
204 2018-01-06 23:29:46 Coach and team are like oil and water. Plus, this is a poorly constructed roster (Crean’s doing). Archie is a good coach and, like Tony Bennet at Virginia, will get #iubb to where it is a consistent threat.
205 2018-01-06 23:29:16 If you didn't see what he said the summary is shaming cancer patients who want to use oil to ease their lives, and his response to that was "move to California" unfollowed him that second
206 2018-01-06 23:29:08 Obviously not unalienable and subject to gov consent considering use of Alien Sedition Act in 1917 and 1939. Was seen as conditional
207 2018-01-06 23:29:02 if ur gonna be wearing makeup tho don't use oil as a cleanser unless you have hours to spare or you won't dry. I use clean & clear's essentials moisturiser for makeup. apparrently you can use oil for makeup removal but I'm still lazy and just use sensitive wipes lmao
208 2018-01-06 23:28:40 I'm not trying to save money, although some people do it for that reason. I change the oil in my truck myself because:
A) It's easy, no need to jack it up.
B) It gives me a chance to inspect the engine and transmission
C) It's faster than waiting at a quick lube place.
209 2018-01-06 23:28:35 or the oil industry complaining about fuel consumption is down because people don't idle like they used to!
210 2018-01-06 23:28:35 Got oil on my boots smh
211 2018-01-06 23:28:24 And jojoba oil
212 2018-01-06 23:27:37 if you want to be a lazy acne-survivor like me, I found that moisturising of a night is the bare minimum you can get away with. As for skincare, I use La Roche-Posay foaming cleanser and jojoba or thursday plantation teatree oil as a moisturiser of a night 1/2
213 2018-01-06 23:27:32 Always happy to rave about @psBEGORGEOUS - especially when get sent a generous package of shampoo, conditioner, total treat argan oil cream and detangling brush!!

215 2018-01-06 23:27:22 Know a few folks who use oil to ease cancer symptoms, this is in florida where it's only just legal and your suggestion is to move away if it wasn't legal. I'll let them know to move away from their families if they wanna live a semi normal life.
216 2018-01-06 23:27:03 Oil, gas and ammo. And some fish, yes.
217 2018-01-06 23:27:02 I should note that this is going merely by the number of ships. By tonnage, this would be much higher, including a battleship, several oil tankers, and ocean liners
218 2018-01-06 23:26:50 なんだか岩手を思い出す。
219 2018-01-06 23:26:34 Oil isn't an export, renewable could be and it's a growing industry, unlike oil and coal that are dying.
220 2018-01-06 23:26:18 Crinkle cut ones are the best. More area for the frying oil to cover and make crispy omg I could eat more of them
221 2018-01-06 23:26:18 Self love is me being thirsty to come home, wash my face with my cleansers and oils, oil my scalp while being cozy admiring how my skin has cleared and hair has grown 
222 2018-01-06 23:25:40 So far I’ve taken 4 Tramadol, 6 Ibuprofen, 6 paracetamols along with clove oil courtesy of @nuggets1990 and NOTHING IS STOPPING MY BLOODY TOOTHACHE. To think girls moan about childbirth  RIP Ticker.
223 2018-01-06 23:25:29 Our country has become sissy's. 10 daughters taught everyone of them how to pump gas,change oil,change a tire.
224 2018-01-06 23:25:28 Lavender oil is my drug of choice for sleep/racing thoughts. It doesn't work on everyone but it does knock me out. 
225 2018-01-06 23:25:26 My mother has SUFFERED with MS for almost 20 years and I’ll be DAMNED if the racist Keebler Elf is going to take her long-awaited medicinal oil from her now. Fuck him sideways with a two by four.
226 2018-01-06 23:25:24 New daddies at the gym....One in particular smells like motor oil. It’s kinda nice. 
227 2018-01-06 23:25:07 Naphtha is supposed to be carcinogenic and can have impurities. Butane and others is a fire and explosion hazard. But CBD oil I have involves CO2 extraction not solvents.

231 2018-01-06 23:24:34 And righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God , your God , has sent you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of JOY

234 2018-01-06 23:23:56 Me: He told me he loved me and I didn't know what to say so I squirted the lavender oil at him

Friends:

Me: *sigh* what have I done now?
235 2018-01-06 23:23:51 Since you don't understand basic English I made a point to what you are saying. If you read the last tweet I said other things kill more animals like birds for example than "oil rigs". I'm talking about the rigs. Not the ship spills. Your points have zero facts to them.
236 2018-01-06 23:23:50 Desperately want a cute oil diffuser. Imagine falling asleep to the wonderful smell of lavender....heaven
237 2018-01-06 23:23:50 After beans are cooked. Make a dressing of lemon, some oil, tahini, add some garlic in food processor, process, then add beans process till smooth.
238 2018-01-06 23:23:49 Water can be covered by oil if you pour it into a bottle, therefore water can be wet.

243 2018-01-06 23:23:06 I'm a shea butter person, though @bluestonearcher made me a body butter of shea & coconut oil, and it's easier to apply than a rock of shea is. 

For sunscreen, Coppertone sensitive. Doesn't have the ingredient that turns orange when it hits hard water in the laundry either.
244 2018-01-06 23:22:44 ? Mr President-why do we import products like soy oil when we grow and have such a supply here right in the US!  Because we tax them and the money goes right to the gov. When we could buy our own products and help support our farmers and many others with jobs and spending here!
245 2018-01-06 23:22:19 probably gonna make oil or butter wirh it. not really into smoking stuff
246 2018-01-06 23:22:15 I bet no oil drilling rigs will be in view of Trump properties. Just guessing
247 2018-01-06 23:22:15 The fall of the Roman Empire! EU citizens have put the oil in the works! The British Engine was roaring then a new driver decided that oil was not needed anymore.... Britain has killed the golden goose and will soon be eating it as there will be nothing else to do!

254 2018-01-06 23:21:46 Non-TBD Cannabis oil should NOT be criminalized, it is a medicinal product that provides relief, healing that scientific studies back up. It is a means for economic growth of states and prosperity 4 many based on good, not evil wicked things the gov't relies on like a parasite.
255 2018-01-06 23:21:44 The GOP, Bought and Paid for...
In 2016 a Putin-linked billionaire who made his fortune off Russian oil, gave Senator Graham’s super PAC $800,000. He also gave McConnell $2.5M, Rubio $1.5M, Scott Walker $1.1M, Kasich $250K & McCain 
$200K .

282 2018-01-06 23:19:10 Mostly the oil doesn’t drowned your food and the circulation helps speed up the cooking.

284 2018-01-06 23:19:04 we may find reliable renewable some day, but wind/solar ain't it.  Also, until someone can show for me with certainty how the earth produces coal/oil/natural gas, we shouldn't discount their quantities
285 2018-01-06 23:19:02 .@tylerepperson is my favorite bc he used my car to get his hair cut and then took it to get my oil changed for me 
286 2018-01-06 23:18:56 U can’t shame me for eating coconut oil !!!!
287 2018-01-06 23:18:55 Rising oil & natgas prices should help producers over time ... more exports = higher prices = more drilling to stabilize prices. That seems to be the plan under both Obama & Trump.
288 2018-01-06 23:18:55 Thanks very much - I heard about this when I was little but never saw it in full before. I remember the tiny bottle of olive oil in Granny's bathroom cabinet, though...

296 2018-01-06 23:17:45 It doesn’t have to come from oil. Our leaders just lack the foresight to really push us towards renewable energy. Also, they get payoffs from oil companies.
297 2018-01-06 23:17:42 Foxnews wasn't even existence in the '70s. You don't think the Arab oil embargo actually happen?
298 2018-01-06 23:17:24 But you drive a gas car yes? Where did the oil come from? There is zero doubt on the earth being at least 4.6 billion years old. The evidence in a myriad of fields is overwhelming
299 2018-01-06 23:17:16 You already showed yourself 2016. So figure lies between 500 n 400. 

As for oil boom or not, it’s all a matter of leadership. Check if Thailand has oil, check their gdp! Do you know how much UK makes from international students, tourism and services?

Stop buying into APC lies!
300 2018-01-06 23:17:12 Gotta get some oil for my whip. Only thing is I don’t feel like leaving the crib.
301 2018-01-06 23:17:11 He’s already been baking wrinkle paint on the oil filter housing....don’t give him ideas...
302 2018-01-06 23:17:08 get a return on their investment in the future, plundering Venezuelan oil to support future ambitions and turning the country into a puppet state?
303 2018-01-06 23:17:05 Yo, I fucking love CBD oil. If y’all get anxiety, maybe try it ?
304 2018-01-06 23:17:04 I take the cake when it comes to car maintenance. Oil change turned into a $900 affair, but hey, I got 2 free months of SiriusXM Radio.
305 2018-01-06 23:16:59 I was at UCSB during this terrible oil spill.  As students, we went out and rescued birds, ducks, etc.  Walking on the beach was awful for years to come... the oil washed up on the shore and your feet/shoes would be black and covered with the oil.  NO TO DRILLING!!!
306 2018-01-06 23:16:25 Needs to do one in Mexico or Brazil. Be about half a syllable long before he’s turned to an oil drum
307 2018-01-06 23:16:14 Woah. I know mercury is in retrograde right now but, I'm sensing negative energy. And I'm here to help you get out of that hole brother. I'll send you some patchouli oil and, we'll get that solar plexus back with a quick Skype session.

309 2018-01-06 23:15:59 Idk if I should use emu oil or tea tree oill to stop my piercings from itching
310 2018-01-06 23:15:52 You might need to build a wall to keep the leaking oil from going into the ocean and killing the marine life.
311 2018-01-06 23:15:51 Armand hammer and occidental oil owned his dad, and was his handler until he died. Commie too, gore gets a mineral rights check still from them and sold then fed protected lands.

314 2018-01-06 23:15:41 Oil prices are volatile and congratulations for not understanding that. Any idea the price of oil in 2014?
315 2018-01-06 23:15:35 That sounds like a bad time could you maybe get the oil tank some kind of specially made thermal vest
316 2018-01-06 23:15:28 Looks like a solid neighbourhood watch meeting is required.

Don’t forget the oil, you want them to sizzle not burn
317 2018-01-06 23:15:28 Producing the oil that provides warmth and runs the engine of our economy? Oh yeah baby. Drill baby drill. #MAGA
318 2018-01-06 23:15:04 I tried putting coconut oil on my face for clear skin AND I LOOK LIKE A GREASY POTATO LMAOOO
319 2018-01-06 23:14:42 I say oil
320 2018-01-06 23:14:36 Palm oil plantations are super fun places to work and absolutely environmentally friendly too!
321 2018-01-06 23:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
322 2018-01-06 23:14:33 All that Snake oil pouring into my 401K.       I will take that all day.  
Go snuggle up with Barry Obama who told you 1.3% GDP was the "New Normal", and "Those Jobs aren't coming back".

323 2018-01-06 23:14:30 For regular body moisturizer palmer’s coco butter pretty much keeps my skin on my body. If I get super dry up north I use a heavy oil like seasame on my skin.
324 2018-01-06 23:14:28 .@ChristianArcand does not have rickets. Gotta hand it to the cod liver oil.

335 2018-01-06 23:13:23 The oil doesn’t spirit itself out of the ground.
336 2018-01-06 23:13:01 It''s the Big Dig- .Take all our Land, Water, Oil and Resources. The Aristocratic will bid the Country out to its highest foriegn biddders; while it's Republicans Supporters commit sacrificial suicide like parasites for worth of a divide PARTY!
337 2018-01-06 23:12:45 Do you know how many women turn a blind eye out of love for their children?  Or just how many presidents had other women?
338 2018-01-06 23:12:39 Well seeing that oil is derived from a organizism that feeds off of soil I would say pump the shit out of it

#Israel and #Spain research prove it’s efficacy in treating #Cancer!

#THC is the drug to ban!
NOT #CBD!
341 2018-01-06 23:11:54 Skipping the catching up so I can manufacture more @DowlingDoser units. They help dose/dispense the concentrated Full Extract Cannabis Oil that my wife with MS uses to treat her MS side effects.  Has not used an n-said for pain in over a year and a half!!!
342 2018-01-06 23:11:51 It's weird to me how Papa John's garlic sauce ranges from creamy to pure oil
343 2018-01-06 23:11:50 Weren't the 9/11 terrorists Saudi Arabian? Isn't wealthy Saudis that fund Islamist extremist such as Al Queda and ISIS? How about you do something about them? Maybe stop buying their oil which funds terrorist? Maybe stop selling them weapons that end up in terrorist hands?
344 2018-01-06 23:11:43 I love oil cleansers. :) Before I found it I used to always wake up with a hint of raccoon eye, I HATE scrubbing at the skin around my eyes, I don’t need to help age the delicate areas

349 2018-01-06 23:11:11 Thank you! It’s on my list to try - looks good (although it does have avocado oil in which is naturally high in benzoates, but I think it may be worth a go! Oh the issues of being allergic to natural products! )
350 2018-01-06 23:11:06 Coconut oil is so-so for my skin, dries me out sometimes.
351 2018-01-06 23:11:03 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
352 2018-01-06 23:10:55 Omg this was me today. Like okay stfu & chains my oil. Got me worried nshit

357 2018-01-06 23:10:30 If Trump loves oil so much, might I suggest he buries himself under a few hundred thousand meters of rock and dirt for a few millennia,he'd get a couple of barrels of Crude out of himself I'm sure.
358 2018-01-06 23:10:29 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
359 2018-01-06 23:10:18 Coconut oil is good but because it’s an oil you have to wash it off after
360 2018-01-06 23:10:18 $32 for a handful of cashews drizzled in oil.. no thanks.. i don’t care how hip the place is lol
361 2018-01-06 23:10:17 I will NEVER understand citizens voting for these snake oil salesman.
362 2018-01-06 23:09:40 I just used rose oil, moisturizer and my rose water spray bc my face is so damn dry. Fuck winter currently

364 2018-01-06 23:09:26 What a great idea! I have some fish oil capsules that Gracie eats only if I squeeze them over her food but I’ll also try butter. I have goat butter too. 
365 2018-01-06 23:09:20 professional wrestling is miming with yelling, coconut oil, boots, acrobatics, and bikini bottoms, and a lil bit of wrestling
366 2018-01-06 23:09:20 Lol what will be the reason
367 2018-01-06 23:09:12 My favorite thing is how you King Trump guys change it to another augment. He is a crooked snake oil salesman that's  giving him and his homies a 4 year tax break. But you are not a leader but a follower that has no gumption. I thought you guys hated yanks?
368 2018-01-06 23:09:11 Went to get an oil change today...left paying $314
369 2018-01-06 23:09:10 can anyone tell me how CBD oil affects their chronic pain / anything else i can do to make myself less in pain
370 2018-01-06 23:09:08 Keep the oil in your lamp keep it burning..
371 2018-01-06 23:09:05 Take your vitamins f#&k them.. their crazy.. Cbd oil is amazing for your central nervous system.. so are sea vegetables.. b complex for anxiety and circulation, vitamin C capsules immune, milk thistle for the kidneys and liver.. Get the book Prescription for nutritional healing
372 2018-01-06 23:09:04 + lavender oil will put you right to sleep like a baby. stay woke (or sleep - whatever)
373 2018-01-06 23:08:54 If you don’t like candles and oil diffusers don’t talk to me. I don’t need that negative energy this year.
374 2018-01-06 23:08:46 The sweden kind. The france kind. The FDR kind. The british kind. Please find an example other than Venezuela you hack. Btw Oil prices collapsing led to Venezuelas situation.
375 2018-01-06 23:08:27 the only thing adding oil to the pot does is prevent it from overflowing. pasta made for a cold dish should be rinsed bc it stops it from continuing to cook but if it’s for a hot dish you want to avoid it and combine with sauce in the pan to complete cooking and serve
376 2018-01-06 23:08:13 OILOIL.ってOILを三回とピリオドを紙に早くかいてみて！

378 2018-01-06 23:08:09 whY does my NOSE contain so MUCH OIL
379 2018-01-06 23:07:54 Then they be persistent with cleaning the windows. Dawg the whole car dirty. Just change my oil & let me go lol.
380 2018-01-06 23:07:46 maybe you should go to a town or city meeting.  You do know they take government money and pay for the oil for your school right?  get active locally and fix your school spending problems
381 2018-01-06 23:07:27 Do you go through a lot of baby oil with your fantasies?
382 2018-01-06 23:07:24 Coughing? 10-15 drops Oregano oil in water or (for no burn) put in veggie caps ... cough gone. Works. You’re  welcome
383 2018-01-06 23:07:21 You are not Scottish and you have probably never worked on an oil rig on your life sweatpea but I did through the Piper Alpha murders so don't comment on STUFF you know nothing about

385 2018-01-06 23:06:49 They are secretly very healthy and my kids whine to get more. They are like banana muffins but then I add shredded carrots, zucchini, pear, and apple. And instead of white flour it’s 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 almond flour. And evoo instead of vegetable oil.

387 2018-01-06 23:06:42 I swear i hate coming get oil changes. They take forever & I’m always in here with people that talk too much. Like girl, shut up.
388 2018-01-06 23:06:08 Is water heavier than oil? I would say so.

391 2018-01-06 23:05:58 Remember State of Louisiana not allowing anyone from out of state to help with the clean up. Only locally licensed companies, who tried to clean oil from sickest, worse off birds & wildlife. Most died b/c  they were 'stable geniuses' and licensed in state. (Kept money in LA.)

393 2018-01-06 23:05:54 Management is used to losing - will take a lot more. Winning one playoff series in 12 years  is deemed a success for oil
394 2018-01-06 23:05:47 The whole world is oil dependent. Regimes in all areas of the world R making billions out of oil sales - much of which goes not 2 the people but into the pockets of oligarchs/princes/kings & entrepreneurs. The quicker we develop alternative energy the better. Cut them all dead.
395 2018-01-06 23:05:39 I ate right before I came to work so I wouldn’t eat here and then as soon as I walked in I ate three slices of pizza and two slices of sourdough rye with olive oil
396 2018-01-06 23:05:28 Why doesn’t the Left ever call out Trump Administration on policy issues? Crickets on that.
They call POTUS mentally ill and supporters stupid because
the economy, jobs, increasing US oil production, eliminating regulations and reducing size of government is going so well.

414 2018-01-06 23:03:38 Yeah, right? They deserve an oil leak in the moat surrounding their towers.
415 2018-01-06 23:03:38 Why don’t you push for no fracking and no oil rigs off our shores!!
416 2018-01-06 23:03:37 Can’t afford groceries Or an oil change but you ask to get floated a dollar on cash app and go to fests across the country. Car brakes squealing. Dish washing sponge the same one you had since 2011. WiFi cut out. I hope you love yourself soon.
417 2018-01-06 23:03:36 Oh good Lord.
418 2018-01-06 23:03:23 should a bitch moisturize with coconut oil today or will that make me greasy

431 2018-01-06 23:02:14 USA only imposed sanctions in 2015 as a result of Maduro seizing power. The economy tanked well before then.  Before that USA was buying $50bn of oil from them. So, sorry, you're talking absolute bullshit.

434 2018-01-06 23:01:47 is ur lotion water or oil based? also mask can go after toner, eye cream before moisturiser xx
435 2018-01-06 23:01:41 That was Carters doing ? I guess runaway government spending in Vietnam era / oil embargo/ private auto companies turning out inferior products were his doing ??? Not a  big fan but give me a break
436 2018-01-06 23:01:40 Dab some wild growth hair oil on a Q-tip and swipe it over your eyebrows twice a week. You should have some eyebrows by the end of this month lol
437 2018-01-06 23:01:25 What do you do w the castor oil? Use as a treatment and rinse out?
438 2018-01-06 23:01:05 Was always bound to increase, was never sustainable. Only way fuel price gets low is when we start refining our oil.
439 2018-01-06 23:01:00 That’ll be perfect for me too because my hair is pretty fine. I just ran out of olive oil but I wanted something different and lighter. Jbco heavy as hell I have to mix that with other oils or water lol
440 2018-01-06 23:00:49 Do we give aid to SaudiArabia? If not, we ought to stop buying their oil & drill for our own...in the Gulf of Mexico if need be, even if Marco doesn't want us to. Energy independence would really set the MiddleEast on their toes!
441 2018-01-06 23:00:36 Suncor, Teck Buy Part of Total Stake in Canada Oil Sands Mine
442 2018-01-06 23:00:29 Ran out of Oil! Ahhh it's so cold
443 2018-01-06 23:00:27 Watching time lapses of oil paintings is so therapeutic
444 2018-01-06 23:00:07 Not necessarily Mark, when you remember that the only thing snake oil salesmen did not sell was snake oil.
445 2018-01-06 22:59:58 True its as if it was oil painted
446 2018-01-06 22:59:55 I dunno I think the Oil could use a player with 8 goals averaging less than 15 minutes a game.
447 2018-01-06 22:59:44 You need oil because YOU drive a car.   Nearly everyone does.  Do you want to bike every where???  Then do it!  But I won't.
448 2018-01-06 22:59:42 Regulations are sometimes good, not always bad. Agree?  Banking/mortgage, oil drilling, mine safety, food/drug, etc. probably not a good idea to just slash because it sounds good. 2007/2008 was not fun.
449 2018-01-06 22:59:37 You mean during the time of oil boom, show me 2014.
450 2018-01-06 22:59:32 Following please follow back I auto unfollow after 48hrs, We’re here to support Trump #FollowBackTrumpTrain 
451 2018-01-06 22:59:27 Someone threw a bottle of Omega 3 pills at me. Luckily the injuries were only super fish oil.
452 2018-01-06 22:59:25 yup!!! L’occitane shower oil is so hydrating
453 2018-01-06 22:59:08 This kind of extreme weather was taught to me as a consequence of human activity back in 1989. Climate science has been consistent. Mouthpieces of big oil and gas like FoxNews are a threat to humanity and should be treated as such.
454 2018-01-06 22:59:06 The Chinese way of making duck involves large pots full of boiling oil... not quite "sauteed" as "deep-fried"
455 2018-01-06 22:59:04 Bih I mixed my Palmers Coco Butter with the Palmer Coconut Oil and I’m still ashier than a muthafucka
456 2018-01-06 22:58:39 Having been wrapped up warm all day with a #cold, I'm really hoping that olbas oil and hot water bottle will see me through the night. Would quite like to be able to socialise with people tomorrow.  Cinema tonight didn't count. #GreatestShowman well worth the 2nd trip.
457 2018-01-06 22:58:37 Shower oil in the winter >
458 2018-01-06 22:58:27 Light Caesar salad with fresh parm & crostini. Grilled shrimp w/ homemade feta cheese sauce over linguine, Side of crisply blanched asparagus drizzed w/olive oil, salt/pepper & a glass of chianti?
459 2018-01-06 22:58:12 Ooooo call it “Oil Slick”  this is beautiful!
460 2018-01-06 22:57:53 I meant putting oil in the water when you’re boiling it
461 2018-01-06 22:57:26 Is that Debbie Wasserman Schultz in the yellow hair.  Who is the guy above her?  Motley Crew of bozos.  

I'll put Trump, Gowdy, Cruz, J. Jordon, Tillerson, Gingrich, and Pence up against anybody they got for intellect, vision, and integrity.

462 2018-01-06 22:57:22 Snake  Oil.
463 2018-01-06 22:57:21 The oil companies kept telling everyone how good they were, how many jobs they had, and how much money they were paying.  Then at the first sign onf trouble the hell with the staff, we have shareholders waiting for their dividend cheques, bosses waiting on bonuses
464 2018-01-06 22:57:17 On Instagram someone said that coconut oil is a perfect substitute for coffee creamer, I’d just like to say no
465 2018-01-06 22:57:12 Kim needs to take an eternal nap-  these are all my opinions  China is not helping us they are selling oil to NK-  and God know what else they are giving NK.  Iran is helping Kim also.  The world is on fire -  you Know 
466 2018-01-06 22:57:12 Yeah that's why al nusra bombed an oil pipeline the first day the protest started right? And afghan Taliban invaders try to sneak across the border smuggling opium and suicide bombers. You're hilarious dude.
467 2018-01-06 22:57:08 Many had him down for 50ish pts and if you are a fantasy hockey player, couple of the mags had him pushing 70 pts.
468 2018-01-06 22:57:08 love when my sweat/face oil looks like highlight 
469 2018-01-06 22:57:03 Did you do the math? The tax plan net benefits to middle income families are crumbs. You gain $ millions! 
You're a snake oil sales woman.
470 2018-01-06 22:56:44 I told Claudia oil isn’t oily just like water isn’t wet and she got mad
471 2018-01-06 22:56:36 Most of this was the agency charged with not only providing permits, but also enforcing laws governing oil drilling.
472 2018-01-06 22:56:31 At excel getting my car washed & it’s prolly gonna be a shitty job but got it freee with an oil change so figured a shitty wash is better than a paid wash 
473 2018-01-06 22:56:26 At least I can charge my phone waiting on this oil change
474 2018-01-06 22:56:24 Ciabatta with olive oil?
475 2018-01-06 22:56:11 Triumphs?  You have to be kidding.  Do you call reversing anti-polution rules for the coal indudty a triumph? Opening oil drilling in coastal waters when 40% of the drilling rigs sit idle to keep oil prices artificially high a triumph? It makes no sense.
476 2018-01-06 22:56:09 But an IQ in oil welfare and grazing on a humble few acres says his esteem is super low.
477 2018-01-06 22:56:07 If you don't mind the smell of peppermint oil, it's an EXCELLENT rodent deterrent. This is the first time we haven't had over-winter guests. 
478 2018-01-06 22:56:01 Yeah, agree on that eyeliner- I usually use a dark shadow and a damp brush because I’ve not found a pencil that doesn’t either feel like an actual pencil or feel like an oil stick
479 2018-01-06 22:55:47 Sheep leading Lions.. 

They ended up getting fat on oil wealth... Destroying Agriculture.. Decapitating education, public services and rule of law..  and mortgaging the future generations.

Now we know... What do we DO?
480 2018-01-06 22:55:45 It can cause so much damage - both in terms of climate change and secondary damage, like oil spills.
481 2018-01-06 22:55:36 Al Gore is laughing all the way to the bank. Sadly the joke is on taxpayers world wide. Gore is a snake oil salesman. A complete fraud.
482 2018-01-06 22:55:25 二期はMay'nか…嫌いじゃないけど…
483 2018-01-06 22:55:19 When I hear my name being called (troublemaker) I starte to think of mixing oil with water and fire
484 2018-01-06 22:55:13 Sweet almond, jojoba, and grape seed are ones I use. My hair is on the finer side so castor oil is too heavy for me.
485 2018-01-06 22:54:55 @dino_grandoni @eilperin Because oil spills never happen and the federal government has never struggled to fund cleanups.
486 2018-01-06 22:54:37 But it doesn't hold up to high temperatures. Weak. Coconut oil on the other hand...
487 2018-01-06 22:54:36 Got the oil heater out as I'm so cold. #ExcitingTweet
488 2018-01-06 22:54:21 Said it couple of games ago and stand by it, at least until the collective get their mojo back. Put Leon or RNH with McDavid and Puljujarvi...and score some damn goals. I'd leave Nuge in the middle but either will do. #Oilers
489 2018-01-06 22:54:09 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
490 2018-01-06 22:54:02 Then put on some baby oil gel
491 2018-01-06 22:53:54 This country would have exploded by now of GEJ was still in government. Nigeria no oil no money ! Simple
492 2018-01-06 22:53:54 Aye, but they’ll be cooked in veg oil not beef dripping as Yorkshire folk tend to prefer! Bet they don’t do traditional Yorkshire fishcake either!
493 2018-01-06 22:53:51 Had to rinse that nasty Jersey Mike’s oregano oil off my turkey sandwich despite pleading for no nasty oregano oil. I swear it’s old pickle juice with a whole jar of bargain dried oregano they got in a vat at HomeGoods in the clearance aisle.
494 2018-01-06 22:53:36 Cola was recommended, via google, as the best thing to clean car engine oil from my block paved drive. And to think that people drink this stuff!!
495 2018-01-06 22:53:30 So many terrorists in the same picture. Time to buy more #Tesla and reduce oil import from Middle East and drill more #oil and drive down price of oil. Cheap oil and low volumes = bankcrupt Muslim countries
496 2018-01-06 22:53:27 Lol, oil prices are on the increase. Or are you denying that. Did you not see the post I sent you?
497 2018-01-06 22:53:22 I’m on a count down... it’s been a min Texas... I’m ready for some down warm air shit it’s too cold up here.. a nigga always ashy I have to put on so oil 
498 2018-01-06 22:53:11 I know he is only saying what occidental oil wants him too. Armand hammer owned his dad and gore jr, the great commie oil tycoon. Mr gore geys minerals rights checks from them still and he sold them fed protected lands exclusively. Snake oil salesman and hypocrite gore.
499 2018-01-06 22:52:58 agree, @chigrl is a must follow as long with @BrynneKKelly for Oil & Gas specifics.
500 2018-01-06 22:52:57 @chefandthef did a mayo tasting on A Chef's Life, and I needed at least twice as much. It's egg and oil and lemon, not melted plastic. What's wrong with everyone?
501 2018-01-06 22:52:55 we need solid plan to deal with plastic pollution ocean acidification & oxygen depletion ,drilling for oil Madness/idiocy!
502 2018-01-06 22:52:54 But don’t forget the new whale oil burning lamps that GE is about to release. The cleaner with less tar and fishy dead whale smell. That’s only of course if they could get to the shops In time with the steam locomotives Trumps is suggesting.
503 2018-01-06 22:52:52 Oil money’s made the fees ridiculous
504 2018-01-06 22:52:39 He got his oil checked big time and the ball was out before he hit the ground
505 2018-01-06 22:52:37 Already have the largest piece of the oil pie here my friend.. you got it right. Although I don't think Russia or China will stand this crisis for long time .. the need to see some clarity for their investments which clearly there's not now! Let's see how it goes
506 2018-01-06 22:52:33 Unfortunately I don't use oil at all! I'll just have to wait for a beardy friend to donate me some of that beautiful packaging I think...!
507 2018-01-06 22:52:32 What is this a Train I missed 
508 2018-01-06 22:52:30 Literally they just throw the spice on things erratically and drizzle some olive oil sparsely and then stick it in the oven and I'm like 
509 2018-01-06 22:52:26 We need to put more photos of the damage oil spills do...More videos & photos bc if ppl can't SEE it...they aren't as impacted by just reading abt it!
510 2018-01-06 22:52:06 Does this primer help control oil too?
511 2018-01-06 22:51:50 Speak out against oil drilling off your coastline-protect the lobsta’s
512 2018-01-06 22:51:31 I do wish it were true but too many who are profitting:
 Big oil $$$, conservative agenda, Wall St/ Banks, the Trump base who cling to him like a Wrestle Mania character, foreign interests known and unknown.
The GOP will have to decide the cost of Trump outweighs the benefit.
513 2018-01-06 22:51:21 While with cupping, they oil up your back and use the wand to heat up different size cups and place them on your back. The heat causes a suction that feels great
514 2018-01-06 22:50:58 Fed up of being ill now & our house stinks of olbas oil 
515 2018-01-06 22:50:53 Olive oil *is* most sleek consumable fat and lubricant. Master Race Card status: retained
516 2018-01-06 22:50:52 Coconut oil does wonders..
517 2018-01-06 22:50:45 Translation:  Trump wants to drill for oil anywhere it suits!  No one else does so they are trying to stop this!
518 2018-01-06 22:50:44 She's running out of lamp oil.

520 2018-01-06 22:50:30 #Enquest #ENQ for every 1 USD that oil price increase, generates 22MUSD per year extra in profit per year.
521 2018-01-06 22:50:24 Drinking 200 pints of anything would surely kill you?  200 pints of oil definitely would.
522 2018-01-06 22:50:14 Just remember where you get your olive oil from
523 2018-01-06 22:50:04 Heaven and hell and make it rich again and pay our respects throwing down and so ruthless and so much oil Do you remember when they use real paper right You know it was very mellow in most every surface much more psychedelic than MDMA.
524 2018-01-06 22:49:56 No way the oil should be this bad. Time for Chia to go. Let the new GM hire a coach.
525 2018-01-06 22:49:52 Used oil.  Just thinking of what that smells like makes me want to puke.  I cannot imagine drinking it.  I hope he gets the help he's clearly crying out for.
526 2018-01-06 22:49:48 Hot oil treatments are life 
527 2018-01-06 22:49:43 Russia trying to work its way into Turkey, Egypt, Iran.
Long range dominance of the oil and cargo shipping canals.
528 2018-01-06 22:49:41 I've long held the view that a certain Scottish oil company will merge into a certain London-based oil company and move into their capacious offices near the Ritz. Sturgeon is shooting herself in the foot (again) 
529 2018-01-06 22:49:38 My family ate margarin too. I think my mom thought it was healthy. But I was referring to Taleb's tweet mocking butter eaters as beneath the olive oil eating master race.
530 2018-01-06 22:49:36 The “big 5” for me are Springsteen, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Midnight Oil, Eagles, Led Zep with honourable mentions for Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, Thin Lizzy. Based on that, can you guess the ONLY Beatles track I like?
531 2018-01-06 22:49:18 Not only that - look at what the Democrats have done to decimate domestic refining capacity. USA refining is so diminished that we ship oil out and import gasoline. This is a strategic nightmare. Bringing a refinery back online is a huge process
532 2018-01-06 22:49:06 Big Boss Man. Oil Money Gang. Make I come UAE come follow flex 
533 2018-01-06 22:49:02 Ah, not only are you a GERS-denier, you're also one of the ones denying that the oil revenues crashed? (from £1.8bn to £60m).
534 2018-01-06 22:49:00 < #油song の曲目から、中の人が主に誰のペンか想像がつくと思います…ふふっ
535 2018-01-06 22:48:49 I can't believe I'm defending NNT, but his point isn't that the "English Renaissance" didn't happen. It's that they never had an original glorious age to re-birth (as the olive oil people did).
536 2018-01-06 22:48:45 Thanks @PetroHome for getting our heat back on!  Excellent customer service from Petro staff and oil delivery guys and terrific service from problem solving technician Mike. Lots of cold people still out there... best wishes to all.
537 2018-01-06 22:48:43 #Enquest #ENQ when 50.000 bpd is reached in Q1-2018 (Kraken).
#ENQ part will be: 35250bpd. 
Plus the rest which is about 37000 bpd.
If avarage oil price will be 75USD/b
And stable cost at 44USD/b.
75-44=31 USD Profit per barell. 
72000 *31*306(days)=682MUSD

539 2018-01-06 22:48:17 At the grocery store with coconut oil in my hair who wants to party
540 2018-01-06 22:48:09 Praying won't help - but our technology might (after 6 years of development effort). Not that any of the oil and gas companies care, or even our government! #SoCalGasCoverUp
541 2018-01-06 22:48:08 I would2 work for Philip Anschutz .. I am pro life& pro Gun pro oil & I would be gladly to donate any % to a cause to support equality for ALL , but  as a Jew I find it disgusting NO1& I mean NO1 will speak on any other investor who isn’t Jewish  .. #antisemites #coachella
542 2018-01-06 22:47:52 But yet LIl Marco is silent on trump trying to give big oil companies drilling rights to virtually the entire coastline. Pathetic leadership, following a “really really smart” insane man
543 2018-01-06 22:47:51 Wow! would love to try Damask facial oil  xx
544 2018-01-06 22:47:49 I will still do it occasionally though, when I went to NYC J.King brought me an oil cart and I smoked the whole thing over the week lol.
545 2018-01-06 22:47:36 Sorry to disagree but Jackie wanted a divorce and was convinced otherwise by the ‘powers that were’.  In the 80s, after ‘Onassis’, I lived in the same building as she did in NYC and overheard her make more than one disparaging comment.
546 2018-01-06 22:47:32 Expecting that #ENQ re-pay some debt this year. Increase of #OIL price will gain the profit. 
Not much shares at #ENQ when debt is re-paid.
547 2018-01-06 22:47:19 Lightly sauté in olive oil and sprinkle with pomegranate seeds. Delicious with octopus toes. #bonappetit
548 2018-01-06 22:47:07 We need to start a pool on the next “attack” from the MSM and the Left will be. This one will last maybe the rest of the week until Trump releases an infrastructure plan or Fusion GPS totally explodes. I will say these attacks are getting very desperate
549 2018-01-06 22:46:58 Like dude you kill people for oil, just say what it is.
550 2018-01-06 22:46:47 Of course I only smoked the high level stuff, I think eventually oil is what ruined it for me. Too strong, not as enjoyable.
551 2018-01-06 22:46:43 After they decimate yet another country for Brand Freedom they head to Somalia and then South Pakistan as we agreed before. Kids die. Not that they care as long as they get their proxy govts and cheaper oil. Sickening.
552 2018-01-06 22:46:35 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
553 2018-01-06 22:46:34 Made a prayer line and anointed with oil in Section 9! God is on the move!
554 2018-01-06 22:46:30 Yes you are right.. yet you want to get rid of Oil.. So that leaves what?
555 2018-01-06 22:46:24 Your the one living in a bubble. No. Correction: You are living in the pockets of oil company executives. #Sad #partyofcorruption
556 2018-01-06 22:46:22 argon oil!! i use it every day after i wash my hair and my hair is SOOOO soft
557 2018-01-06 22:46:08 I wish I had more black friends. You oil my scalp, I’ll oil your scalp.
558 2018-01-06 22:45:57 Consider also.  Most ppl live on coasts. They are more liberal. 45 is taxing those states SALT, and put drilling rigs off the coasts, and lifted regs from BP oil spill.
559 2018-01-06 22:45:47 2 tbsp of Vegetable/Olive Oil
100ml of Dairy Free milk (I used almond)
Pinch of salt
560 2018-01-06 22:45:46 So now when there's a spill, cleanup will be on us taxpayers not the oil companies.  So Trumpian to be always looking out for the super wealthy and shafting everyone else.
561 2018-01-06 22:45:14 This one hasn't been as popular as the others but I quite liked it. So sick of all these 'Get ready for Ofsted' snake oil merchants!
562 2018-01-06 22:45:11 I put the wrong oil on today and it explains my slumpness
563 2018-01-06 22:44:54 Sure would look nice whit a couple of oil rig off shore!
564 2018-01-06 22:44:49 Annual @DallasStars vs. @EdmontonOilers tweet. I keep a tally of this b/c it’s so fascinating. Stars 64-17-9 vs. Oil in 25 years. @MikeHeika please grab your media pack & check if accurate. 
565 2018-01-06 22:44:40 Yup and this season will certainly lead to more moves and the fear of what those end up being is what should have every Oilers fans terrified beyond belief.
566 2018-01-06 22:44:40 Serious question though....Where the heck did my eucalyptus oil go?
567 2018-01-06 22:44:38 That only brings in scrap metal. Express yourself without jumping on a legitimate opportunity for people who both need and want knowledge and skill. Let me know when you're selling your car so I can warn people that you've never changed the oil.
568 2018-01-06 22:44:22 Nurse yes,  98 plays like Phil Esposito, which is not effective in today’s NHL.  Find me one example of him beating a player one on one?
569 2018-01-06 22:44:20 Redwell, will eat five Chia pets tonight and a ounce of soil water with olive oil, before 12:00p.m. tomorrow.
570 2018-01-06 22:44:09 Dudee, "aioli" it's a Catalan sauce made (originaly) with only oil and garlic (there's some that adds egg like my dad) and its completely different than mayo. And actually it's called "all i oli" #cookinglessons
571 2018-01-06 22:43:47 I wonder if I can switch my oilers seats for oil kings seats?
572 2018-01-06 22:43:35 Yeah the oil doesn’t do much to moisturize tbh it’s mainly there for treatment! But i don’t like to put anything else with it and oil is supposed to go last anyways~ I really recommend the snail!
573 2018-01-06 22:43:01 I just love seeing all of the makeup and oil on my sunglasses from my face
574 2018-01-06 22:42:44 I can now add Essential oil safety to the list of taboo conversations you’re not supposed to have with mixed company. Sheesh, you tell someone hot oils are not safe for children and all hell breaks loose.

576 2018-01-06 22:42:36 Umm... was that the one in which they said oil was just a bonus?
577 2018-01-06 22:42:35 I don't think they got lucky last year but almost everything went there way. Expecting the same amount of good fortune after making the team worse was a bad bet.
578 2018-01-06 22:42:29 Crude $OIL ( $wti ), a slight downward correction is possible up to 59 - 60.1. The main long-term trend seems to remain bullish.
579 2018-01-06 22:42:19 Use it instead of butter to fry the outside of the bread lol. It's eggs and oil, makes a perfectly crispy sandwich.
580 2018-01-06 22:42:07 I can imagine several scenarios where he loses every red cent he's made even before we get to him backing this snake oil quack of a trainer.
581 2018-01-06 22:42:00 Sadly bro venezuela now has no allies only neighbouring countries with interests on its oil!
582 2018-01-06 22:41:54 Rich oil peoples
583 2018-01-06 22:41:17 Heres the flaw ..  e-books need energy for them to be read/downloaded etc .. energy comes from oil/coal/trees. Books conserve energy .. they can release it when burned.
584 2018-01-06 22:41:14 Baptiste brand dry shampoo spray (I got @ Target) is great for refreshing roots & adding volume on non-wash days. Eliminates oil w/o drying ends.

588 2018-01-06 22:40:37 i need an oil treatment and a retwist asap!!
589 2018-01-06 22:40:20  Oh no! I use coconut oil as a moisturizer...
590 2018-01-06 22:40:17 100% and safe to say last year was a reach on the good and this year has been a reach on the negative. Like you, not sold on the middle ground being enough.
591 2018-01-06 22:40:14 Why don’t you at least listen to what oil companies are willing to give back to your state. 1. Ask 20% of all crude oil pumped,Ask that same amount of oil be refined for only MAIN @$0.p/g for oil/gas home heating products.Retail Heating oil price froze for 50 years . Cheep heat
592 2018-01-06 22:40:13 What does this # include? I figure Iran must be spending $10b/yr if not more on Iran operations.  Over $5b in lines of credit alone. Reports Iran paying salaries for 250K fighters = $600m/ yr minimum. Discounted oil. Weapons.
593 2018-01-06 22:40:12 S A M E. Burn my face off with that chili oil sauce.

597 2018-01-06 22:39:51 It’s like that glass bottle filled with essential oil cleaner KNEW how long I’d been putting off sweeping and mopping the bathroom floor and THREW itself to the floor. 
598 2018-01-06 22:39:51 Yes, unlike you. You adhere to a paternalistic dogma that, apparently early on in your life, taught you that thinking was bad. If you don't know how to think then you can be manipulated by oil companies $$$ & bankers $$$ into believing anything. The money changers own you.
599 2018-01-06 22:39:37 I desire pho!
Brisket and maybe some tendon, with lots of basil and chile oil and sriracha. I want my broth nuclear orange. :9
600 2018-01-06 22:39:29 Not football related. If you traveling w/pets  or other stressful situations, those calming collars & pills are useless. Don’t waste money on that crap. It didn’t work on my cats. I haven’t tried marijuana oil though. I was told it makes them calm....BTW, dogs fly easy...

607 2018-01-06 22:39:01 State&them rolling on through. They've even taken family farmers in families generations, Foreign companies used Eminent domain on American's land, crazy shit huh? But that Canadian oil company&all that have gotten off pretty easy. Oh&some EPA stuff, well makes u wonder if all
608 2018-01-06 22:38:57 Another bullshit game by the Oil. Not a fan of crap effort. Fire the lot of them
609 2018-01-06 22:38:52 I got the curry one I was reluctant but it was good I added a lot of chili oil it wasn’t spicy good luck
610 2018-01-06 22:38:43 OH i shouldve waited. i saw u added the oil. maybe ill try the snail one!!!!
611 2018-01-06 22:38:27 An oil bill is not identification. Photo ID is identification. We have more security trying to get into our smartphones.
612 2018-01-06 22:38:24 Lavender & Sandalwood body cream with lavender oil. IT WAS THE BEST and helped me so much. Upset with myself for using it so fast.
613 2018-01-06 22:38:19 Maybe the oil drilling started.
614 2018-01-06 22:38:07 diantara grapeseed/sunflower/argan/olive/cococonut oil yg paling ngefek yg mana ya? Makasih :)
615 2018-01-06 22:38:03 Whats some other good gels from the EcoStyler line besides Olive Oil, and Argan Oil ?
616 2018-01-06 22:37:55 The gringos haven't invaded 'cuz they're buying Venezuelan oil despite the regimes' ideology, and they've been doing so since Chavez's times. That why they won't move a finger about Venezuela.

618 2018-01-06 22:37:28 Just in case you are keeping track, Trump/GOP:
•Is set on opening up 90% of our offshore land to oil drilling
•Didn't renew a tax on oil companies for oil spill clean-up fund

621 2018-01-06 22:37:11 I'm a millennial, but with tendencies of old school style... So I'm always gonna freak out a bit when the oil I pour into a car is anything other than some type of golden brown.
622 2018-01-06 22:37:00 The plot of the Foreigner only it's me hunting down the people who siphoned my oil.
623 2018-01-06 22:36:59 What oil crash?
624 2018-01-06 22:36:54 I think they want to get ahead of any future acute shortages in dollar supply (which caused the 2015-16 decline). I don't see how a Petro CNY makes any sense for oil producers to sign on to. Plus CNY is backed by USD. China can't ditch the USD w/o popping its internal bubbles.

636 2018-01-06 22:35:34 10, 32, 38, 43, 44, 49. Story of my compliments online, but that was the theme? It's just a nightgown, but parole keep motor oil and stuff …
637 2018-01-06 22:35:32 If you don’t like drilling for oil! You shouldn’t drive! 
638 2018-01-06 22:35:29 They are, but not enough to do this. It's the oil.
639 2018-01-06 22:35:27 "He's mentally unstable!" - People who need therapy after someone mentions Rapeseed Oil.
640 2018-01-06 22:35:04 Let's agree to call a stick a stick. She's no oil painting, but that's a woman.
641 2018-01-06 22:35:00 Tax bill opened up Alaska refuge to drilling. Why did you think your state would be exempt from Trump admin genuflecting to oil industry?
642 2018-01-06 22:34:53 I've done my best to move on and have to an extent but every time I think about this team with him still in place or watch Jersey play, my blood starts to boil.
643 2018-01-06 22:34:52 We prob have different definitions of robbery. If someone sells snake oil on the street corner to a fool, I consider that robbery. You apparently don't because if someone is willing to buy it, it's all kosher. I view fortune tellers as robbers, for example.
644 2018-01-06 22:34:45 And what do the people who cried for the North to give our taxmoney to help them during the hurricanes this past Summer do in response?  The people in the South RAISE the price of OIL on the North!  So much for "We care for each other," eh?
645 2018-01-06 22:34:40 Mr. @SethAbramson . As usual, you outdid yourself. [15 and 16 are the bottom line].

646 2018-01-06 22:34:35 So the heater isn't working now bc the boiler needs to be refilled with oil and I've been on the phone waiting for someone in PETRO to answer but they're busy AF ughh
647 2018-01-06 22:34:33 Energy is the foundation for our economy and standard of living, and oil and natural gas provide the majority of the energy that American’s depend on every day – at home and at work
648 2018-01-06 22:34:14 Interesting!!!!! I have really thin eyelids. I double cleanse (a oil cleanser then a goat milk soap) but tbf i dont SCRUB my eyes

655 2018-01-06 22:33:28 They barely managed to put together a fiscal plan with the benefit of high levels of oil taxation revenue (which they misrepresented with their 'bonus not a basis' line). The economic situation hasn't improved since the oil crash, so it cannot be looking good.
656 2018-01-06 22:33:17 went grocery shopping, got gas and got my oil changed. that’s enough adulting for today.

659 2018-01-06 22:32:24 @CTVMontreal Hello are you hearing of oil heating outages in homes due to high volume calls jn which oil companies can't keep up with demand? I ordered home heating oil 5 days ago and still no Delivery.
660 2018-01-06 22:32:13 Coconut oil is so much better than lotion.
661 2018-01-06 22:31:46 So apparently the oil glands in my eyes are plugged, which is why my eyes get dry and itchy. But my prescription barely changed from 5 years ago. Sitting here dilating and everything going out of focus.
662 2018-01-06 22:31:40 That’s why I’m not allowed to go by myself to the car wash anymore. Or to get my oil changed. I will buy whatever they tell me I need.
663 2018-01-06 22:31:33 Does this mean we produce oil secretly and the proceeds goes into the gnassingbe's coffers. Pls we need more light on this Farida

666 2018-01-06 22:31:03 Joe says hot water... Dave says oil. Too many options. I thought I’d ask the best! I’m betting Joe that @D_Ross3 will reply!
667 2018-01-06 22:31:02 Transmission oil ? You don't have to change it till your car is like 75k miles or so but it depends.

672 2018-01-06 22:30:44 Silly, aioli is Mayo based but it’s not the same thing as mayo  mayo is plain, aioli has something added like garlic or siracha or truffle oil- it’s like fancy mayo.
673 2018-01-06 22:30:39 (2)..people r a dime a dozen! & U became prez because ur a SNAKE oil salesman, i.e.,Trump Univ. U 'TRICKED' ur base into believing all the..
674 2018-01-06 22:30:37 If he ties Petro w crude sale, it might actually be a great idea. It would allow him to sell 2/3/4x as much currency as oil he produces annually. A portion of Petro would always to redeemed by crude traders, but a significant portion might be accepted by citizens and speculators.
675 2018-01-06 22:30:35 Why are people putting gold leaf on everything. Like face masks, arts and crafts, oil?? I even saw it on slime today -_-. 

Serious question, what happened to the good old days when we only used it on barfi??

678 2018-01-06 22:30:18 Perhaps, but the ongoing Venezuelan crisis doesn't benefit the US either. At least a democratic Venezuela opens a potential market and oil reserves. I'd just hope that there are good people in the government who'd want to help, not exploit.
679 2018-01-06 22:30:16 RT @DWStweets: Donald Trump's plan to dramatically expand offshore oil drilling near Florida would be terrible for our state, our coasts, and our economy.
680 2018-01-06 22:30:11 Consistency may be the oil, but variety is the spice of living. Don’t limit your options by subscribing too literally to the idea that you must be consistent. The rules should be steady; the consequences of violating them can vary.
681 2018-01-06 22:30:05 Checked that..and no, sunshine..like I said, reality check for you.  I think you're losing it. Suddenly oil rigs not in the picture?  Go back and play with your mental blocks. You're a waste of space, environmentally speaking..

688 2018-01-06 22:29:24 As long as it is not braking the law, or harming the company, I don't think private companies should take action. Just because they don't like beards, it would be wrong to stop servicing people with one. If you cut people off, you only make them angry and add oil to a fire.

693 2018-01-06 22:28:31 I like using a 1-5 Sysco truck rating system for places like that.  You clearly need about 5 more films of some oil and a pound more salt.

You gotta start with some onions, butter/oil let that cook then add the eggs, add a little bit more butter and take them out every 2 minutes to turn for those 5 minutes. (I like mine half done)

706 2018-01-06 22:27:12 Apparent not the oil majors that were letting Barents Sea leases lapsed. You probably need sustained crude prices North of $80/bbl, to Alaskan far offshore viable.

Well my bad

A nice baguette, some salami, prosciutto, some pickled eggplant, provolone and spicy oil is a thing of beauty.
716 2018-01-06 22:26:12 IMO unless your going to make a dedicated career to it, Mad Money only. Buy and hold.
717 2018-01-06 22:25:53 Eric Decker: Roll around in Crisco oil all week.
718 2018-01-06 22:25:49 Snake oil salesman.  Satan disguised as a carnival barker.  GOP acting as slaves to this evil.  Americans who voted for him know perfectly well what they wanted.
719 2018-01-06 22:25:46 Oh, we're all fine, just heating oil, but the house smells terrible right now. My guys from the EPA are coming Monday to fix it, but until then, it's heated pools and continental breakfasts
720 2018-01-06 22:25:43 Same Leon I watched in Junior. Goes through wild swings in output.
721 2018-01-06 22:25:33 Laure And Motherhood. Water and oil (presque don’t mix) #Spiral
722 2018-01-06 22:25:30 For one reason! @SpeakerRyan & @SenMajLdr couldn't sell their snake oil to Trump supporters with @vp Pence installed.
723 2018-01-06 22:25:23 Why the hell is it almost 50 for a oil change?!
724 2018-01-06 22:25:21 Ford dealer, some of it appears on eBay sometimes but you don’t save much.  If you are only topping up though you won’t need much as it’s not really a thirsty engine oil wise I have found.

727 2018-01-06 22:24:00 So AG should stop the crack down on the states that have legalized cannibus, good to hear! How about the special interest monopoly on energy! Even the playing field. Not just oil and gas get get sub. We just fixed the energy problem and saved ton of money on for profit prisions
728 2018-01-06 22:23:54 Sorry I meant commercial shorts in oil
729 2018-01-06 22:23:30 Venezuela imports everything. Oil is only industry. Pegged to dollar. Debt in dollars US/ China. Black market rife, corruption, drought. Wealth concentrated in 5 families. No equivalence to UK ( or anywhere )
730 2018-01-06 22:23:15 Is really big and square , has it bicycle paths? and parks? . The cheap oil I guess made it polluted...
731 2018-01-06 22:23:15 But I thought Dri and Luc were better than Mal and Kes according to Oil fans? Those two couldn’t also be overpaid could they?
732 2018-01-06 22:23:14 Feels puppets feet are super dry cause of the weather
Get coconut oil I use for my hair
Melts some on my hands andrubs it into their paws

Y'all they won't stop licking EVRRYTHING I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
733 2018-01-06 22:23:09 This matches with net oil spec shorts as well (huge, effectively long dollar)
734 2018-01-06 22:23:08 So all we need is water and a bit of oil. Done. Save yourself 
 the £££ of premium face creme
735 2018-01-06 22:23:07 honestly. Taking care of my hair helped me. Hot oil treatments. Hair masks. Pre pooing. I only wear my hair down and a bun or a ponytail.
736 2018-01-06 22:23:06 adam: erm..rian i get we need to do this but do i really need to be shirtless?? im off camera..

rian: shut up its art *pouring more oil onto Adams big titties*
737 2018-01-06 22:23:06 We all know the squeaky wheel gets the oil (libs, haters, idiots, wannabe Dr.’s, etc...) and they are the first ones to fall off the rails. Pres DJT, keep steaming ahead fulfilling your campaign platform. This is what most of us want, some 100% some 75% but in the end we all win.
738 2018-01-06 22:23:04 Also where do I buy the oil from there's no buy page on castrol site

Charmed circles at my feet; 

I am Abiku, calling for the first

For palm oil and the sprinkled ash? 

Yams do not sprout in amulets

To earth Abiku's limbs.
746 2018-01-06 22:21:26 I’ve been at @Honda for 2hrs waiting for my car to get an oil change and other stuff.

But like I haven’t had breakfast, lunch, and I had to be in Desert Hot Springs by 2pm. What the hell.
747 2018-01-06 22:21:26 Yeah I just fact checked and windmills kill more birds than a oil spill. About 3 times as much annually. That's reality. More animals are killed by other natural causes than oil spills. So really what are you trying to prove? Oil rigs are not even in the picture. Einstein
748 2018-01-06 22:21:24 Girl, you VOTED for this. Why don't you challenge your buddy John Cornyn's support for Big Oil?
749 2018-01-06 22:21:21 Mom: Ur a lesbian so you need to learn how to change the oil and do car stuff since you’ll never have a man in you’re life
750 2018-01-06 22:21:14 Popcorn with truffle oil. Try it
751 2018-01-06 22:20:58 Where can I get tea tree oil lol
752 2018-01-06 22:20:41 I made garlic bread but I had forgot about it  that was the easiest to make b/c you just take baguette slice it , mix a cup of olive oil & parsley , & brush it on top & then you can add shredded cheddar cheese on top if you want then bake it till crispy.
753 2018-01-06 22:20:41 I’m getting an oil change then I’ll hit you up
754 2018-01-06 22:20:40 Some oil, some garlic, some butter, salt and pepper to taste...what’s the problem?
755 2018-01-06 22:20:32 Mean Panda Express chicken teriyaki tastes like rubber tire strips dipped in motor oil with flecks of broken wind shield glass for texture.
756 2018-01-06 22:20:25 Jesus just really hates clean water and the poors, loves oil, war and rich people.
757 2018-01-06 22:20:23 No heat/chemicals, air dry, I use R&B leave in conditioner by Lush after washing it, also coconut oil masks every once in a while help, and also trimming the split ends off every few months. Good luck 
758 2018-01-06 22:20:06 im trying oil pulling n i dont think i can do it yall coconut oil is so nasty
759 2018-01-06 22:20:01 of course we know that answer is immediate profit, but why are we not conserving out oil supply for after the middle east runs dry.

763 2018-01-06 22:19:20 I actually look at none other than the NYT this morning on the 3 issues you pointed out (fracking, oil drilling and the bank issue) and i walked away with the opinions I mentioned earlier.

768 2018-01-06 22:18:47 Garland is bad and crazy but he can make me chuckle. Scott Dworkin is the one who gets on my nerves because it's nothing but an endless torrent of pedestrian snake oil carny salesmanship. "Come see the Trump Is Terrible tweet, retweet and follow to help the Resistance™"
769 2018-01-06 22:18:42 Na wao! Sonola vegetable oil.
770 2018-01-06 22:18:31 There is a likelihood that T-bills may rise above 15% in Q2. I'm looking at "the need for govt/ politicians to raise funds for next year's election" except of course if oil prices continue to rise
771 2018-01-06 22:18:30 Wealth transfer..just Ban oil based plastics...many plant based plastics available instead... biodiverse biodegradable...but no ..why? think
772 2018-01-06 22:18:11 Incense or a nice oil, oil probably better
773 2018-01-06 22:18:11 Haha noooo don't be sorry. I was happy to just be out somewhere, taking in the culture etc. I was pleased with myself when I found the room that used to have the oil in it, stood on the balcony like "...once. Oil was here." x
774 2018-01-06 22:18:07 no no no don’t do this coconut oil is comodogenic and will break tf out of your face !!!
775 2018-01-06 22:18:03 Somehow, Julia got me out here changing her damn oil. Swear to gawd this woman is spoiled.
776 2018-01-06 22:17:51 Looks like he's gonna do some oil changes in the parking lot
777 2018-01-06 22:17:51 Yesterday I got all excited finding a Tweet listing food to soothe knee pain.

Only thing listed I could eat is Salmon and fish oil pills.
778 2018-01-06 22:17:51 i haven’t had to blot my face because of oil since a year ago. My skin is finally coming back to normal thank god 
779 2018-01-06 22:17:44 Let me go find some castor oil
780 2018-01-06 22:17:41 what did the oil give up for al montoya ? 
i know i could look it up but it's funnier just to ask here.
781 2018-01-06 22:17:39 coconut oil by the jarsss
782 2018-01-06 22:17:06 Well we still have more of this we going to 15 by the start of 2019. If it's Alberta it's gonna be a shit show they are notoriously anti helping each other out .they didn't even wanna share oil with the rest of Canada . OG trudeau forced them and they still hold that grudge

785 2018-01-06 22:16:24 Response at 4:25pm to a 2 family home at 16 Tennis Rd in Mattapan for a Haz Mat in the basement. An oil delivery truck was filling a 275 gallon tank when it ruptured spilling an estimated 170 gallons of home heating oil. No injuries.

787 2018-01-06 22:16:11 I have some spare time so I may finally write a book. Title: "How we got here; a History of Modernity From The Plague to Hiroshima". It starts with the birth of a boy in Mongolia and ends with wrong projection on 1980s oil price, with a straight line connecting the two.
788 2018-01-06 22:16:00 The number is much, much higher.  Iran is covering the costs of 10s of 1000s of affiliated forces in Syria, including Hezbollah. It is making loans and selling oil at a discount. I can’t imagine what Iran has spent. If it’s less than $10bn per year I’d be surprised.

791 2018-01-06 22:15:46 Spark plugs isn't a job for me sure I'll top it up with oil if need be as I check it every month or so. but I wouldn't know which oil tbh.
792 2018-01-06 22:15:38 I would like your nips and bite them and oil them up and maybe put some nip clamps on them
793 2018-01-06 22:15:34 Cute math. So shutting down Alberta's entire oil industry would be 'doing our part'? Saudi Arabia would replace our market share in 1 day. And nothing would change. Except Alberta's way of life. Solutions must acknowledge reality. Now let's stop fighting.
794 2018-01-06 22:15:32 Just walked into the kitchen and stated that I could smell the Olive Oil. Cue hubby, "That's what Popeye said." Ewww lmao!
795 2018-01-06 22:15:28 Adding a few drops of sesame oil gives it an egg foo yung flavour - I use this method for egg-less fried rice!
796 2018-01-06 22:15:21 By endangering the American public. No EPA, trying to bring Coal back (lie), angering foreign allies, poking the North Koreans, limiting our natural resources & Park systems, drilling oil in our oceans and generally standing for 33% of the dRUMPers NOT the nation.  Idiots!
797 2018-01-06 22:15:16 Walk alot , bounce on one of those exercise balls too !! And evening Primrose oil  helps thin the cervix!
798 2018-01-06 22:15:11 Oil change, car wash, full tank of gas- my car got pampered today :)
799 2018-01-06 22:15:05 made my tofu but had a bunch of hiccups. didn't have any vegetable oil, so i had to use coconut oil, which can't get as hot, so the tofu didn't brown like i wanted it to. hopefully i still like it
800 2018-01-06 22:15:01 I told the waitress I didn’t want my horchata cause it tasted like baby oil and my dad mad cause im being rude at his fav restaurant lmfaooo he clearly don’t know me
801 2018-01-06 22:14:58 the tax should reduce consumption? So it’s a help to oil cos.
802 2018-01-06 22:14:49 Salty as hell I had to go out there and put oil and antifreeze in my wheel. It’s cold as shit

805 2018-01-06 22:14:21 Their daughter couldn't walk across a room, ride a tricycle, go to preschool, play on a playground until this oil was made for her. Now he intends to take this away from her, returning her to a life of pain & her parents to a life of fear for their child.
806 2018-01-06 22:14:16 Affordable fem. products- make more money or marry someone who can afford the basics. The market sets the prices. No one is subsidizing your tampons.
Equal opportunity? More women than men in college now and feel free to work on oil rigs if you wish.
With you on breast feeding.
807 2018-01-06 22:14:13 We have done something about it. But even so, the oil industry and even our government doesn't care! We would never have predicted THAT! We could never have predicted that SoCalGas would have refused to even look at our technology! #SoCalGasCoverUp
808 2018-01-06 22:14:01 I have changed the oil in our Toyota Tundra 3, maybe 4, times now and I am convinced it is impossible to complete the job without having used oil run down my arm.

812 2018-01-06 22:13:54 Sounds reasonable considering claims they do jobs Americans can't live on.
 Have to survive somehow.
813 2018-01-06 22:13:27 ...the middle class into thinking they r getting tax cuts, drill for oil in the oceans, create a police state, ignore the judiciary & put their ultra rt wing

819 2018-01-06 22:12:59 The other thing to remember & I've been saying it since camp, there is a big difference between being the hunter and hunted. Pressure can be quite the beast at the best of times.
820 2018-01-06 22:12:56 Em, I can’t remember any unionist leader saying oil was worthless. Many said you can’t build an economy on one industry (as plenty nationalists have since 70s) but not same as saying it’s worthless
821 2018-01-06 22:12:52 Nice, as you know the wife has the non-sporty comfortable old man version of that and they are cracking cars.  Make sure you use the proper (but expensive) oil though when servicing it.  And the spark plugs aren’t cheap either come to think about it.
822 2018-01-06 22:12:47 You guys at @NatResources work at the pleasure of public tax money. You should be trying to preserve our natural resources and quit tweeting about a private company. What are you doing to protect public lands? Big oil and big business got enough $ already.

824 2018-01-06 22:12:19 I’m very happy with Rafa! Hopefully this takeover can go through and Rafa can spend billions of Saudi oil dollars on better players!  
825 2018-01-06 22:12:05 I know, which is why having the federal government, in the hands of that man, co-opt this program is mind boggling. I know how hard CA has worked to clean its environment, being able to see LA again for example, and to bring oil and gas to the forefront is insane.
826 2018-01-06 22:12:01 I Love your Sarcasm!  It s no joke though! Just Greed WE ARE out of the Fuel crisis & font even need more oil they just want more MONEY  and GENECIDE FOR US ALL!ZORRO SPEAK UP
827 2018-01-06 22:11:37 The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is no longer being funded by the people who do the oil spills.  Since 1990, that's been a thing that's been funded by the oil industry.  Coupled with Deepwater Horizon & migratory bird regulation rollbacks...
828 2018-01-06 22:11:32 Saudi diversifying from oil. Trade deals realigning with yuan/oil/gold exchanges regionally. China to be "savior" for DPRK problems and solidifies new trade route land and sea. US dollar not included.
829 2018-01-06 22:10:50 Still not convinced the USD is that important. Oil, steel, but other than that: the EUR is much closer and more important to us....

250ml vegetable oil
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

Blend it up!

843 2018-01-06 22:08:49 In 2016 I got an art set from my mom. It came with a rainbow of acrylics, a canvas, an easel, a dozen paint brushes, a dozen coloured pencils, 5 sketch pencils, a small watercolour set, and every single colour of oil pastel. I've only ever used the sets of pencils.

846 2018-01-06 22:08:21 3 cups white flour; 1 cup water; 1/4 cup olive oil; 1 packet yeast. Sometimes have to adjust water/flour one you get mixing but this has been my standby for 25 years. Hope it helps.
847 2018-01-06 22:08:10 That's also true, it's seeming more and more obvious that Talbot and the Oilers overachieved to some degree last season. Truth/reality probably (hopefully) lies somewhere in the middle.
848 2018-01-06 22:07:51 I took a chance on a new coffee blend while I’m waiting for my oil to be changed but I DONT LIKE IT and now I don’t know what to do with it!!
849 2018-01-06 22:07:43 What’s crazier is that we have been through this multiple times before and people still can’t see it.  Time to fire the equipment man.

MEN ARE TRASH. I went to walmart to get oil for my car. and the guy at the register looked at me and said “you’re going to change the oil by yourself?” and when I said yes he was shook.
851 2018-01-06 22:07:26 I have frosted and oil slick. The oil slick one is not my fave but if I could figure out how to use it with powder shadows I may like it more.
852 2018-01-06 22:07:26 Hi! I use Shea butter (a lot) to moisturize my hair, mixed with argan oil, castor oil and sometimes coconut oil...
853 2018-01-06 22:07:14 Only down by 3 now!  That's MY GODDAMN OIL at work! #LetsGoOilers #Oilers #GoOilers #EdmontonOilers
854 2018-01-06 22:07:11 Oil rig money though fam 
Plus I'm gonna be living with my best friend
855 2018-01-06 22:06:57 The last thing needed anywhere on our coasts or public lands (which need to be cherished, not shrunk!) is drilling for oil. We need investments in energy technologies to carry us into the future!
856 2018-01-06 22:06:39 Scott Prudimwit sure isn't helping!  Oil soaked a-hole!!!!
857 2018-01-06 22:06:33 yaaas to both sets of photos!  and I'm so sorry about the oil 
858 2018-01-06 22:06:31 Good point that. Could easily dupe people into thinking that was the area of the country the oil was found in
859 2018-01-06 22:06:00 If a solid cooking oil at room temp = saturated fat = UNHEALTHY. Eating can lead to high cholesterol and heart disease.
860 2018-01-06 22:05:55 Haha touché! You are correct Rob
861 2018-01-06 22:05:50 Incredible self-loathing.
North Sea Oil - Scottish oil - servicing a nation of 60m people would generate far more wealth to a nation of 6m #NorwayOilFund

Remember, Scotland voted Remain in 2014.
Stop talking about Scotland like it is an Independent nation. It isn't.
863 2018-01-06 22:05:46 No big deal. Santa gig going into off season.  Gotta pay bills.
864 2018-01-06 22:05:46 空所を埋めよ。 There ( 1 ) ( 2 ) a number of layoffs in the oil company recently.

867 2018-01-06 22:05:17 Big Tobacco vs medical science
Big Oil / Coal vs climate science
Coca-Cola vs health science

Is there a pattern here?
868 2018-01-06 22:05:16 Probably but I don't think he's a Top 5 goalie and he was that last season.
869 2018-01-06 22:05:16 Obama made darn sure everyone knew he had to “clean” up the mess of GWB....following a 07-09 fall on HIS WATCH and caused by Clinton administration housing financial practices to inflate growth. ‘15 Oil crash on HIM! Now he wants CREDIT for growth from Trump? Get out of here.
870 2018-01-06 22:05:09 Only positive about dis game so far beez dat #Bang dip chit hasn't been noticed by meez behind de oil net.

872 2018-01-06 22:05:04 Please let us not forget that until Jan 1 2018, oil companies were taxed 9 cents on the dollar to pay for oil spills.  After Jan 1 2018, they are taxed zero so the public will have to pay for ALL their messes.  Thank you Donald and the Republicans.
873 2018-01-06 22:04:58 You can’t?
874 2018-01-06 22:04:53 "Yesterday, President tRump's Interior Department announced plans to open up oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States marine waters, putting more than 100 million offshore acres under imminent threat from the Trump administration and Big Oil." #Climageddon
875 2018-01-06 22:04:42 Awesome video!
876 2018-01-06 22:04:24 just roast it with a little olive oil and black pepper, or make a posh version of cauliflower cheese. All good :)
877 2018-01-06 22:04:05 Nice to.see Leon finally get on the PP board...still can't believe that's his 1st goal of the year.

879 2018-01-06 22:03:48 #CBB now I am fully aware that I'm no oil painting and a lot of people won't find me a catch, but I'm not going to be outraged/offended about that, I'll smile and move on! 
880 2018-01-06 22:03:45 Eliminating oil & gas requires replacement with renewables. Ergo coal has to go 1st. @KenCaldeira @bsaxifrage
881 2018-01-06 22:03:45 Oil... Heated at high temperature... Bursting open...
882 2018-01-06 22:03:44 My moisturizing routine involves at least one body oil, body butter and a body cream with SPF. It's a lot but I have a pathological fear of being ashy and I like to smell like cocoas and vanillas and chocolates. This heat won't let me though 

Any lotion is too much lotion.
883 2018-01-06 22:03:40 Because why would anyone want to invest in the future while there’s still oil and coal in the ground???
884 2018-01-06 22:03:36 i like coconut oil
885 2018-01-06 22:03:35 olive oil+sugar=glowin grease
886 2018-01-06 22:03:30 Day 3 of the keihls midnight recovery oil and my daughter held my cheeks and told me my face is soft. Pretty good review?
887 2018-01-06 22:03:27 Our Face Serum and Dry Oil Mist are very similar in that they're both certified organic, have no self tan smell and give a BEAUTIFUL, subtle glow that is buildable! 
888 2018-01-06 22:03:19 Its not accurate.. its bn weeks i dd check on ur profile..
889 2018-01-06 22:03:19 Got myself a pretty sweet oil diffuser. 
890 2018-01-06 22:03:04 There are more grounds for trumps impeachment than the national parkland grounds he gave away to the oil corps and uranium 1.
891 2018-01-06 22:03:00 Thank the maker. This oil bath is going to feel so good.

892 2018-01-06 22:02:59 Thank you for saving the jobs on the oil rigs. My nephew was burned 60% of his body from a fire on a rig. My son risked his life on Deepwater Horizen II trying to help Deepwater Horizen I.  Rig work is very dangerous. But in La. & Tx. it's a job. These guys aren't deplorable.

896 2018-01-06 22:02:47 So you guys would prefer to just keep giving our enemies money???  We need to become energy independent and by doing this we need to drill for our own Oil!
897 2018-01-06 22:02:36 Asked my mom to get cooking oil she said no. Her boyfriend ask her to get beer, she buys 2 boxes for him.
898 2018-01-06 22:02:22 The toxic issue is interesting, because at least fission is ~1 million times more energy dense than coal/oil/NG—& the waste is solid, more easily stored/maintained/secured/protected, vs dispersed throughout the atmosphere for the next several centuries
899 2018-01-06 22:02:17 I swear this thing is a lie. Can’t remember that last time I was on your TL
900 2018-01-06 22:02:12 I got my oil changed, washed and vacuumed my car, cleaned out my closet, and got my nails done. I’m feeling super productive today.
901 2018-01-06 22:02:11 Pair of original signed oil paintings in ornate frames depicting beach scenes- bought in Paris- immaculate. £120 the pair.
902 2018-01-06 22:02:03 May I suggest you lead the way and immediately stop using any and all oil based products. Share that experience with us. Thanks for your leadership.
903 2018-01-06 22:02:02 A #stablegenius would not deny climate change and open up our national parks and pristine waters to oil drilling. More like #dumblunatic #DonaldTrump #Drumpf #sendhelp
904 2018-01-06 22:01:58 Totally agree Graham. You’ve known my views on this snake oil salesman of a manager for two years or more. Never ever should be allowed to manage again. Coates should have sacked him 18months ago  glad to see the back of the twunt tbth
905 2018-01-06 22:01:40 The Maracuja Oil has saved my life and skin
906 2018-01-06 22:01:37 Electricity has never come from oil! Recently some of it is coming from gas but before that it was mostly from coal! We can get 100% of it from renewable energy within the next 30-40 years.
907 2018-01-06 22:01:36 I totally agree. Even when our democracy isn’t broken like it is now, large gov programs are birthed through multiple steps, which is why I think Medicare For All will bring universal healthcare most quickly. For profit HC Insurance cos are the whale oil merchants of 21st century

910 2018-01-06 22:01:07 Also surprised he hasn't yelled about "eliminate vehicle idling" by yelling about the oil industry
911 2018-01-06 22:00:49 So True,,, Your descriptions made me chuckle.....
912 2018-01-06 22:00:43 I’m gonna get back into coaching. I’ve decided. Not to roast the Oil, but seriously.
913 2018-01-06 22:00:35 I’ve lived in California. Jerry Brown already permits oil drilling all along the coast.  You can’t miss the many many rigs as seen from the shore from Long Beach northward, or the drills on the shoreline. It is a mess w/them. It’s a shame too because it ruins the coastline.
914 2018-01-06 22:00:27 January 06, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

918 2018-01-06 21:59:58 Discovering dry shampoo changed my hair life. Also, once my hair got used to only being washed once a week, it started producing less oil, fwiw.
919 2018-01-06 21:59:18 No power.....No fuel...No new hospitals....No new schools....just new aides and advisers.....

920 2018-01-06 21:58:56 Believe he left plumbing for Oil and Gas role of some kind and once heard he got £600/week at Peterhead. Premier League offers not much better than that full-time.
921 2018-01-06 21:58:39 And I realized that karl isn’t here. He’s changing the oil in both cars and taking them for a wash.
922 2018-01-06 21:58:23 This seems to be about baths (where the bath does as much good as the mag!!) but I use it as a mag OIL and expect only local, not systemic, benefits.
923 2018-01-06 21:58:17 @CNN @potus claims his rhetoric and @UN sanctions have made #NKorea talk . Does he know that Sanctions on Oil was one of prime reasons #Japan bombed #PearlHarbor and #US finished up in WWII ?
924 2018-01-06 21:57:51 If you are a meat-eater, they are amazing cut in half, sauteed in a little olive oil, some finely chopped vidalia onions and a generous sprinkle of bacon.  Complete meal in a pan.
925 2018-01-06 21:57:43 Roast cut-up potatoes and squash in oil & S&P til brown. Put in heated pho broth. (Broth made from roast chicken bones with onions, carrots, fresh ginger, cinnamon sticks, star anise, cloves, coriander seeds, soy sauce, fish sauce.) Whirr it all up with stick mixer.
926 2018-01-06 21:57:42 @veteranhank And please explain to me how all these Big Oil Companies aren’t part of the swamp either ? That’s a little hard to understand considering he’s giving tax cuts and payoffs ? If that’s draining the swamp then he’s doing a shit job of it
927 2018-01-06 21:57:32 Burning the midnight oil (well nearly). Blocking in the base colours for the new Mousehole piece.
928 2018-01-06 21:57:32 Wow that analogie is dumb cause rich people the few(like whales) poor people are like the whalers(many). The whalers are the ones that say "ohhhhh yea we need oil, u have a lot of it, we don't so its only fair if we take urs (they atleast didn't say the whale stole the oil)

931 2018-01-06 21:57:08 Kung kaya nila yan gawin matagal na sana nilang ginawa. The increase in oil tax would lead to increase of basic commodities 'matik yan.
932 2018-01-06 21:57:02 I think you gotta commit mentally to like 3-5 yrs for a GM and 2-3 for a coach. The revolving door behind the bench hurt the Oil tons 07-15
933 2018-01-06 21:57:01 Trump's Taj Mahal did pay FinCen fines for anti-money laundering violations. He is just a  snake oil salesman. He is not known for his superior intellect, his respected integrity or his good character.

937 2018-01-06 21:56:17 Have just seen it work so many times, hard to argue with clinical experience: mag oil curing muscle cramps, spasms and twitches.
938 2018-01-06 21:56:16 My skin hates coconut oil. I’m convinced

944 2018-01-06 21:55:16 Change the oil, check and fill all the fluids, change a tire, even rotate the tires and change the breaks before I could get my license. Oh and read a map too. Long before GPS. But I’m with Corey now, let someone else who does it for a living do it.

946 2018-01-06 21:55:13 I’ve always said the Western interest in the Middle East isn’t just about oil. It’s no coincidence Babylon and Mesopotamia once stood there.

950 2018-01-06 21:54:45 33 better raise that .905 save % because you can play on bad teams and still have good s% but bad GAA 
I don’t need to tell you .905 is not a starter stat.
951 2018-01-06 21:54:29 Just like McConnell, Ryan, Jordan, Grassley, Gowdy take millions fr NRA, Big Oil, Big Industry and in return they vote against gun regulations, deny climate change and vote no on environmental regulations. PAY FOR PLAY OUT THERE IN PLAIN SIGHT. FOLLOW THE MONEY, ITS DOCUMENTED.
952 2018-01-06 21:54:20 I prefer olive oil, doesn't kick up acne as much
953 2018-01-06 21:54:12 Yes they have oil it is about 1% (or very low amount) of the oil imported to UK. The govt doesn't give a toss about anything, other than power, full stop.
954 2018-01-06 21:54:05 It's GK. Every night they rub the machines down with coconut oil.
955 2018-01-06 21:54:04 do you know iran owner second source of  gas and oil in the world with innumerable another sources and has many poor
956 2018-01-06 21:54:02 It's an affront to the oil and gas industry, to be sure.
957 2018-01-06 21:54:01 It's just one thing after another!! EPA, taxes,federal lands, oil drilling, regulations that safe guard us. These ppl scare the shit out of me every damn day!!
958 2018-01-06 21:54:00 Oil only need to score 1 lousy goal every 5 minutes to gain a point. Is there anyone that honestly believes they can't do that?                                    hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahhahahahahahahaha
959 2018-01-06 21:53:57 Me too & soil & oil & diesel 
960 2018-01-06 21:53:49 Organic coconut oil is one of the best natural moisturizers for the skin. If you can't eat it, you shouldn't be putting it on your skin! :)
961 2018-01-06 21:52:58 I did the same thing til I found one that worked for me. I LOVE LOVE LOVEEEE the Soap & Glory Vitamin C face wash. It's amazong. Also tea tree oil is always a winner
962 2018-01-06 21:52:57 I understand that,it doesn’t change this.But then I guess the West keeps eating oil.
963 2018-01-06 21:52:57 That sounds good. In olive oil?
964 2018-01-06 21:52:56 This weather even exposes yet again the fallacy of wind and solar.
with globally vast resources of coal oil gas CSG and as yet untapped vast methane hydrate resources..fiddling with fake electricity is a wasted expense
965 2018-01-06 21:52:56 Taylor sat on my baby oil for 15 minutes, broke the cap, and when I realized and told her, she said “I’m so thick I didn’t even feel it”  bitches gain 2.5 lbs and swear they thick 
966 2018-01-06 21:52:52 Madaming pantawid gutom? Like what? Instant noodles na magmamahal rin ngayon? You can say that because you can afford those alternatives. The poor doesn't have that choice. You do realized that the increase in oil tax would lead to higher prices of basic commodities?
967 2018-01-06 21:52:32 The roster has had a few tweeks since last spring’s playoff run.  So maybe more work could be done.  It’s also about how assets are used.
968 2018-01-06 21:52:30 Who will investigate that phony Trump Foundation where donated money was used for trumps personal toys? (trump oil painting!)
969 2018-01-06 21:52:06 Good ol Oil and Gas which still pays the GOP to keep the people down so they can pollute with impunity. Hate the GOP and everything they stand for.
970 2018-01-06 21:52:00 My opinion is too many key players regressed this season. Klefbom and talbot especially. Maroon, benning, letestu (on the PP) too. Draisaitl not up to par
971 2018-01-06 21:51:52 It is not a balancing act. The risk to the right to privacy and the risk of personal loss ought not to be seen as collateral risk. In fact the technical risk of which you speak can lead to the expotential risk of fraud. Data is the new oil .
972 2018-01-06 21:51:43 I feel like I’m invincible after i get an oil change lol
973 2018-01-06 21:51:05 If Talbot's playing to last season's level, the #Oilers are likely in a playoff spot or at least in the race!
974 2018-01-06 21:50:57 Honestly the fact that I smell my peppermint oil and think of a York patty is really sad.
975 2018-01-06 21:50:56 Again.... Holtby. There’s just a large gap between the two right now.
976 2018-01-06 21:50:54 it rattles me when so many people (not pointing the finger at you) are willing to give Talbot a free pass. He hasn't faced much scrutiny this season and he's been every bit as mediocre as anybody/everybody else...
977 2018-01-06 21:50:46 Good chanxe Oil/Tit  will can Mularkey within 48 hours if teamloses. Will at least let him get on plane ride home
978 2018-01-06 21:50:35 Cleaned my car got my oil changed now gym then meal prep
979 2018-01-06 21:50:14 My bro TJ had a whole jar of coconut oil in his car and he did not know he could use it for hair growth/strengthening his hair.
980 2018-01-06 21:50:09 Now that is a fair point. I saw his play in New York many times. Ok. #HateTheRags
981 2018-01-06 21:50:03 Give the birds a helping hand throughout the winter months. Take advantage of our incredible seed prices to provide a well balanced diet for wild birds just when they need it most! Black Oil Sunflower and Wild Bird Seed bags now ONLY $9.99! See stores for details.
982 2018-01-06 21:50:02 Who was the Mush in Chip oil ?
983 2018-01-06 21:50:00 My mum's homemade coconut oil is doing wonders to my skin.
984 2018-01-06 21:49:49 I really need to go to Whole Foods to get some fruits and grapeseed oil but the nearest one is in Harlem and that's just too far for this weather.
985 2018-01-06 21:49:42 if u can eat them like that then u can start having fun with them and mixing them with all kinds of stuff.. next time u roast some veggies throw Brussel sprouts in the mix. coat with olive oil n salt n pepper n perfection is born
986 2018-01-06 21:49:32 Hey not disagreeing with you. But having a goalie who can make stops when the team isn’t playing well is also pretty valuable and he is not that guy  IMO. Either was Dubnyk but they flourish on well defensed teams.
987 2018-01-06 21:49:05 The Advance levels like oil You just need to sand trim well and do not put first coat on too heavy nor over brush If you know all this just write 'Stop tweeting'
988 2018-01-06 21:49:00 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
989 2018-01-06 21:48:41 Your dad must be one of the oil marketers of at least a local government chairman.
990 2018-01-06 21:48:27 It also hurts you backup progression and you can’t count on him. Grubauer has actually played and we’ve benefited
991 2018-01-06 21:48:20 You would be the expert on failing miserably.
How that server with Kraut and Tea going? Or that trying to intimidate people online with their info? 
Maybe you should try something you're more cut out for, like selling snake oil or starting a cult.
992 2018-01-06 21:48:19 @YogscastSjin @Bedgarsan  love the Ark you two are doing, to fix the oil slick like water glitch install The Island or the Centre map (can't remember which) the textures needed for the water are stored in it! :)
993 2018-01-06 21:48:18 It offended many people's sense of streets-paved-with-oil-gold entitlement.
994 2018-01-06 21:48:12 roasting and sauteed I find take that bitter out the most. but there r certain things u can mix them with to make that bitter really good. cut them in halves. use equal part butter equal part olive oil. throw sum garlic and onion the pan n call it a day..
995 2018-01-06 21:48:06 Like if you don't have twitter
996 2018-01-06 21:48:03 I would say both his seasons were good. The fact he needed time to adjust going from Rangers to the Oilers should've surprised no one.
997 2018-01-06 21:47:48 Nivel de chino?
- Alto.
- ¿Qué es Oil?
- Vielnes.
- CONTLATADO!
998 2018-01-06 21:47:42 Like to know , and I’m sure this info is around somewhere , with oil prices low we were told Scots are ‘subsidised’ by £1200 a year each , where does that balance lie year on year since the oil started flowing ?
999 2018-01-06 21:47:24 Also what paint do you use on the trim? We now exclusively use Advance by Ben Moore a waterborne oil
1000 2018-01-06 21:47:18 A republican who likes his oil/gas/mining donors more than he likes his constituents.
1001 2018-01-06 21:47:03 HE'LL NO. and Stop The B.S..
Move ON. Be an American.
Be smart or get educated or go dig for oil somewhere. FOCUS!!
1002 2018-01-06 21:47:03 Yes go for it, lets get the oil flowing from within this country.
1003 2018-01-06 21:47:03 Like I say. Time will tell.
1004 2018-01-06 21:47:00 This reminds me of coconut oil, deff getting  some Hawaiian breeze vibes 
1005 2018-01-06 21:46:55 To the people of Fujimori (DELINQUENT) they give them MILK, PANETON, GAS, PACKAGED ICE CREAMS, CHOCOLATES FOR THEIR CHILDREN, RICE, OIL, they teach it to me and they mock my face, the Venezuelans who have come are accomplices. The police observe all this and give themselves
1006 2018-01-06 21:46:42 *texts Kurt*
me: i need help, what oil do i get for my car 
just to say i have never done this in my life 
1007 2018-01-06 21:46:39 I’m like a young Macho Man Randy Savage except my muscles are smaller, I’m covered in more oil, and I eat more Slim Jim’s
1008 2018-01-06 21:46:38 And the Caps figured it out after a while you can’t just let Holtby play every night (like some think Talbot can do) no matter how much he says he can.
1009 2018-01-06 21:46:37 Trump’s foundation did such good work in acquiring oil paintings and Tebow memorabilia, it’s a shame they were shut down for illegal fundraising practices.
1010 2018-01-06 21:46:32 Tapers, jojoba oil, and I have some tape so I thought about trying to use that, but 8g is so small I think it'll be difficult
1011 2018-01-06 21:46:25 you ever stare at cosmetics like “oatmeal face rub with avocado oil and raspberries” and want to eat it
1012 2018-01-06 21:46:19 Tier 2 Hazmat going out in boston, 16 Tennis Rd for 140 gallons of oil spilled in the basement
1013 2018-01-06 21:46:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet illegal immigration.
1014 2018-01-06 21:46:04 Dean Henderson book next  big banker's and the oil in the Persian Gulf summer like that anyway. But will have to wait a minute because I'm on breadline money to sort out is stupid
1015 2018-01-06 21:45:56 Finally got a oil change LMAO
1016 2018-01-06 21:45:50 I got some beard wash and oil for Christmas. Whole new world, bro!
1017 2018-01-06 21:45:46 He was a backup b/c of the guy in front of him in MY and his stats haven't slipped much since coming to Edmonton. This year isn't pretty but that's on the team as a whole.
1018 2018-01-06 21:45:40 Rexxon looks like the adult in the room. We must never forget that he was hired by his BFF, Vlad, to lift sanctions and broker biggest oil deal in history between Rosneft & Exxon. #TillersonIsTreason too.
1019 2018-01-06 21:45:27 One of my favourite tenders in the league.
1020 2018-01-06 21:45:11 I can’t speak for everybody but I rub olive oil on my baldy
1021 2018-01-06 21:44:58 Dependency on foreign oil is not good and we should open upstate NY to fracking for gas.
1022 2018-01-06 21:44:50 Oh, ok, that makes a lot of sense! Since I didn't open it before cooking, I didn't even consider that. I LOVE this product! I use @WeightWatchers and it works so well with that program. Last night I had it with olive oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes. So yummy!
1023 2018-01-06 21:44:48 Real? With Trump & gilt hair-all genius & golf balls & no basic wit? Secure & safe? With gun toting-toddlers killing more people than terrorists, white suprematist terrorists, The GOP killing our planet with greed & oil? Better financially, with tax breaks for uber-rich? Really?
1024 2018-01-06 21:44:47 this eucalyptus oil better do me some good
1025 2018-01-06 21:44:43 2Twenty2 Tavern. Was there for the Oil game in October and loved this spot.
1026 2018-01-06 21:44:30 Bro there’s deff oil money coming in from somewhere. Madrid aren’t even this reckless with their money. Like I said something fishy going on, 30plus for Samuedo or however you spell his name, 40 for paulinho, 180 for Dembele, 160 for Coutinho, 100mil for Griez. I don’t get it
1027 2018-01-06 21:44:23 My room smell like sweet pea  this oil burner is EVERYTHING
1028 2018-01-06 21:44:09 trump should be exiled to an Atlantic oil rig he’s reopening where #TinyHands can only see the US from offshore until he croaks
1029 2018-01-06 21:43:58 100% and as you hinted at, that applies to the collective.
1030 2018-01-06 21:43:47 FANTASTIC ! Finally we can be energy efficient !!! We won’t have to buy oil from foreign countries that abuse, rape, torture and kill their women, gays and children. Some of these same countries have given millions of dollars to FAKE FOUNDATIONS to keep drilling at a minimum.
1031 2018-01-06 21:43:46 Believe me,.... I know how lucky we are to have Holtbeast. It’s a crutch that has come up handy many times.
1032 2018-01-06 21:43:39 will.. at least you wont have to pay that 9 cents on the barrel for oil clean up spills as they just reduced it to 0!
1033 2018-01-06 21:43:33 Nice! HUGE oil reserves of off Palm Beach FL!! Big $$$! #GoFrackYourself
1034 2018-01-06 21:43:20 Oil change
1035 2018-01-06 21:43:11 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
1036 2018-01-06 21:43:11 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
1037 2018-01-06 21:43:07 Blue 2007 Pontiac G6. A little over 137K miles. Just put in a brand new battery and gave it an oil change. About to be for sale.
1038 2018-01-06 21:43:04 Time will tell. He’s had ONE good FULL season as a starter .. last year. And it was damn good. Maybe set too high a bar. I saw him in NY before. He’s solid. But inconsistent at best. But you see that here already.
1039 2018-01-06 21:43:04 Thanks for that and as an fyi, l have played, as well as many other sports for years and coached soccer for well over a decade. And b/c of that, don't question the effort pro athletes "give" but you're entitled to your opinion.
1040 2018-01-06 21:43:00 We can’t be dependent on Middle East oil any longer.  If drilling paves the way for energy independence and closes the gap for us to build out nuclear & renewables then we should go all in. Everyone wants clean renewable energy but that reality is at least 20 years away. #MAGA
1041 2018-01-06 21:42:39 someone left cbd oil on the table. the solution to my anxiety is HERE
1042 2018-01-06 21:42:29 Who got oil pens
1043 2018-01-06 21:42:16 Sad the radioactivity pouring into Pacific. Gulf of Mexico still has layer of oil.
1044 2018-01-06 21:42:05 Dweeb...get a grip..sorry he is not a snake oil salesman like #Potus44
1045 2018-01-06 21:42:02 I put a drop of pure oil of oregano in my mouth. 1 hr later, my mouth is still burning. #ithinkimdoingitwrong
1046 2018-01-06 21:41:48 Im on the fence, lots of goalies have that unreal season that makes people believe. Hamburgler, remember him? I still think Talbot is more then that but it’s questionable he was a back up goalie for a reason.
1047 2018-01-06 21:41:26 Oh well Oil.  I've got a bike to put back together.  At least one of us should get some work done today.
1048 2018-01-06 21:41:14 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
1049 2018-01-06 21:40:52 Missin playoff football because im stuck getting an oil change. 
1050 2018-01-06 21:40:42 Not really, the man is insane and so is this plan. Even the oil companies know we need to leave it in the ground.
1051 2018-01-06 21:40:37 หาเพื่อนคุยอ่ะ
1052 2018-01-06 21:40:34 there's gotta be enough olive oil for the both of us
1053 2018-01-06 21:40:22 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
1054 2018-01-06 21:40:15 What part of christianity was used by Bush to invade Iraq? Oh, the part in the bible that says to liberate Kuwait? or if you prefer, the part that says to take their oil? Either way, not done to further christianity so your point doesn't make sense.
1055 2018-01-06 21:40:08 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
1056 2018-01-06 21:39:59 Winter of Dad update: it’s 4 degrees outside and he’s out talking to the oil man, asking him how much oil he’s delivered this week. #
1057 2018-01-06 21:39:58 I’m deadass bouta save some money and do my next oil change myself
1058 2018-01-06 21:39:56 I'm comfortable with saying he's a top 10ish goalie (7-12) not this season but in that range.
1059 2018-01-06 21:39:53 @kaptainsunshine oh that's nice unfollow me because you didn't like my tweet about oil.. Did you think I was trump supporter..
1060 2018-01-06 21:39:53 And compare to Deep Water Horizon, Exxon Valdeez, tar sands oil extraction, pipeline leaks over aquifers, & the refining operations fueled by the frack gas/oil supply chain with massive methane leaks & birth defects within 1km of drill sites. CO2 is the big problem Exxon said so.
1061 2018-01-06 21:39:44 Las tweet about de oil 
What eh wide playing squad. Eh team doesn't have to do eh ting on thier rushes  (unless McDavid), jus close off de middle.
1062 2018-01-06 21:39:42 Can California and any other west coast state prevent resupply vessels from leaving port if against state law?  Or allowing pipelines or tankers to transfer oil onshore?
1063 2018-01-06 21:39:36 Leicester managed it without oil money, oh but there weren’t coached by a specialist in failure. Ask any player if he wants adulation or medals, he will take the medals. Nasri knew, so did RVP and Fab.
1064 2018-01-06 21:39:31 Hard job well done 
1065 2018-01-06 21:39:29 Yes, his PU design couldn't cope with the new oil regs. The 3rd PU introduced in Silverstone was decent, the 4th as you pointed out was a disappointment because there was no real improvement when compared to Mercedes power & reliability was a major concern already in the factory.
1066 2018-01-06 21:39:29 Remember the new tax scam bill removed the .09 cent tax per spilled barrel for oil cleanup, so you can profit even more when there is a spill. Having the Florida residents scramble to grab that oil after the spill is ingenious, Michael!
1067 2018-01-06 21:39:23 marinated in olive oil and spices. but that should be done before steaming in the sauna to achieve the best taste.
1068 2018-01-06 21:39:10 Open up everything, GAS, OIL hell even National Park Land to make money.  But sell a little pot? He is shutting that right down.  NO money in POT for the Trumpster.
1069 2018-01-06 21:38:40 あ〜反対方向だったかぁ〜ｗｗｗｗｗｗ
1070 2018-01-06 21:38:36 I found all the oil companies were horrible to deal with. Minimum order, advanced notice, a new regulation every week. More and more money every time they refill. It got to the point I got rid of oil all together because they were too hard to deal with.
1071 2018-01-06 21:38:35 4 cups whole wheat or white flour
1 tablespoon sugar or honey
1 packet of yeast, or 3 teaspoons
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup oil
1-1/3 cups warm water

Put together dry stuff, mix, put in wet stuff. Let rise 30 minutes. Boom. Pizza dough goodness.
1072 2018-01-06 21:38:31 Obviously, it's snowballed on them the other way this season but their shortcomings are what they are.
1073 2018-01-06 21:38:19 I want an oil diffuser #giveaway #OliviaHowellAbel we need this 
1074 2018-01-06 21:37:56 @GwenGraham 
 As if you care...You voted for the tax bill that cut oil spill cleanups so all fish would be in jeapordy. You voted to cut environmental regulations that protect water quality.  How dare you say you care about fishermen.
1075 2018-01-06 21:37:55 PSA: if you subscribe to a good magazine, and toss/recycle past issues, please do the world a favor and surreptitiously place them on tables in oil change places or car wash waiting rooms. Some of us don't love Hunting, SnowGoer or NewRoads…
1076 2018-01-06 21:37:51 <living bottle of olive oil
1077 2018-01-06 21:37:47 Many coastal governors are against the drilling. That's a good thing.  Sometimes $ isn't everything. PLUS - we need to work on alternative fuels, renewable energies. THAT is where DT is lacking. He also has best buds in the oil biz.
1078 2018-01-06 21:37:37 Conte going to slap Jose 
1079 2018-01-06 21:37:37 Where is my Big Mac?  Where is my Diet Coke?  Where is my Border Wall?
Where is my Tax Cut?
Where is my check from,Putin for removing all those sanctions on Rissoan oil drilling??
1080 2018-01-06 21:37:32 Said this roster was flawed last season but everything fell perfectly into place. Expecting that to happen again wasn't realistic. Imo, a top 3 finish in the division was a reasonable goal but not a favourite.
1081 2018-01-06 21:37:28 Honest question: is there a legislation that compels Oil Marketers to sell at all times provided they have fuel?
1082 2018-01-06 21:37:28 I'm saying the Soviet Union was correct about hydrocarbons.

Oil is a abiotically formed mineral. 

Saturn's moon Titan is covered in hydrocarbons. So if they are fossil fuels that's proof of life on Saturn. 

Or more likely hydrocarbons are abiotic.
1083 2018-01-06 21:37:24 にゅや……意外と遠いのね……。でもどうせなら行ってみよう！時間はあるし！
1084 2018-01-06 21:37:10 Actually the sell of oil leases amounts to generating revenue, which needs to be initiated in the House & get the advice and consent of the Senate on two counts, because it’s a treaty. Our Constitution was designed specifically to prevent this type of action by Executive Branch.
1085 2018-01-06 21:37:07 Or a GM that failed to ice a full NHL roster. Good thing oil have had so many high picks to gamble them
1086 2018-01-06 21:37:07 That's fair, they are all to blame and all in this together, including Talbot. You can count on one hand how many games/points he's stole for #Oilers this season. He's lost them more games than he's won them this season IMO. Mediocre at best and a big letdown.
1087 2018-01-06 21:36:50 MOAR HOT OIL
1088 2018-01-06 21:36:49 To date, no one in government has shown any interest in our technology aimed at preventing another BP disaster, even though many in Congress were aware of our work beginning in 2010! Go figure! But how sick is that? That's how much 'big oil' & the U.S. seems to care about safety!
1089 2018-01-06 21:36:46 Heated the oil too much.
1090 2018-01-06 21:36:45 おはようございます〜
1091 2018-01-06 21:36:43 Labour was a party for working class.  Baxter labour MP lived in Banton area and told us when oil was first found that it would run dry after 10 years. Would never vote for them again a parcel of rogues, waiting to jump on the gravy train to WESTMINSTER
1092 2018-01-06 21:36:42 Definitely trying this! My mom has a mixture that she makes at home. Raw Shea butter + coconut oil. I’ll try it. Thanks sooooo much!!!
1093 2018-01-06 21:36:14 Black soap,  Coconut oil,  witch hazel oil,  almond oil,  rose water and other essential oils coming to your doorstep 
#anticipate #skincare
1094 2018-01-06 21:36:10 2 days, still no oil, minus 12, not happy with @irvingoil
1095 2018-01-06 21:36:09 Typical conservatives, longing to live in the dark ages, without infrastructure, just swimming in oil. Staying ignorant.
1096 2018-01-06 21:36:03 Anyone wanna pay to get my oil changed??
1097 2018-01-06 21:35:39 Cadbury. Can you find alternatives for the palm oil you use ?
1098 2018-01-06 21:35:36 Took me about two hrs to change the oil on my car...shit wasn’t easy lol
1099 2018-01-06 21:35:35 I still have grease and oil in my skin from working on Tom’s car yesterday.  Ugh. Just dude things.
1100 2018-01-06 21:35:30 My go to survival kit for calming down: kalms tablet, chamomile tea, lavender oil, hot water bottle, Adventureland.
1101 2018-01-06 21:35:23 Getting hot is hard when your ideal diet is bread and oil!!!!!
1102 2018-01-06 21:35:21 Put a good amount of raw Shea butter (I would break it down in the palm of my hand with some sweet almond oil). It’s very heavy & more moisturizer than I’d be comfortable with during the day but my skin would soak it up at night and I just wash in the morning for super soft skin!
1103 2018-01-06 21:35:18 A beautiful oil rigging operation added to the Mar-a-Lago view & free oil? We look forward to the inevitable oil spills! Thanks @MMFlint! MAGA
1104 2018-01-06 21:35:14 “You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room
1105 2018-01-06 21:35:12 I was unaware of your NHL resume but please enlighten me.
1106 2018-01-06 21:35:11 I'm a physicist, the argument is not the role of those gases, the argument is that human activities affects significantly the amount of the gases in existence to the point destroying the world.
Madam it's a snake oil sales pitch.
1107 2018-01-06 21:35:05 as an extension of that dont over cleanse or use a cleanser that makes ur face feel tight or cracking. always wear sunscreen! and dont be afraid to use oils. imo rosehip oil is the best. it fades scars too
1108 2018-01-06 21:35:05 Norway also Western Europe's biggest oil producer. Just beat off a court case brought by Greenpeace to stop them pumping....
1109 2018-01-06 21:35:02 She’s chilled, Keith. It’s the lavender essential oil!
1110 2018-01-06 21:35:00 White sage, patchouli oil, and strawberry leaves, sis.
1111 2018-01-06 21:34:58 Hoy pasé la rotonda de la oil, creo que ya estoy apta al volante 
1112 2018-01-06 21:34:53 Never actually tried painting on plasticine before - it feels a bit wrong, like smearing engine oil on your toast or something.  works pretty well though
1113 2018-01-06 21:34:40 The best part of baking peppernuts for mystery hunt is the part where the dough’s chilling in the fridge and my hands smell like anise oil (aka NOW)
1114 2018-01-06 21:34:39 Black seed oil
1115 2018-01-06 21:34:35 You ever meet someone so greasy you're worried that the US might invade their face for oil?
1116 2018-01-06 21:34:11 Snake Oil on @ThePeakyBlinder perfect fit @foals
1117 2018-01-06 21:34:02 At the dealership gettin a oil change. Dude told me all he noticed was a little corrosion on the battery. . Good. Cus i was hopin it wasnt anything else.
1118 2018-01-06 21:33:53 For soup, cook ground onion in oil, then simmer with fish, oregano, chicken broth and bean sprouts. Top with scallions.
1119 2018-01-06 21:33:53 Fox News Anchors know that when the President issues alternative facts, a true #Christian dies a slow emotional death
1120 2018-01-06 21:33:53 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1121 2018-01-06 21:33:53 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
1122 2018-01-06 21:33:52 Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsome or Kamala Harris as President of the Peoples Democratic State of Cali? All Federal lands remain in USA, like Vandenberg AFB, Edwards AFB, Camp Pendleton, Yosemite, off shore oil fields, etc etc. Brilliant
1123 2018-01-06 21:33:30 Governments suck at EVERYTHING! The Venezuelan socialists, with the world's largest oil reserves, literally has driven the nationalized oil company into the ground; and yet Bernie-kins are STILL in a state of denials!
1124 2018-01-06 21:33:24 Yes, tea tree honey. It has a slight medicinal taste but does not taste like tea tree oil :) and after a mouth full of garlic all I taste is the sweetness.but You wouldn’t want to put manuka honey on toast or anything like that.
1125 2018-01-06 21:33:20 J: Oh wait baby, it says here you have to cut up the garlic and soak it in oil, and then pour that in your ear to clear up sinus congestion
Me: *with an entire clove of garlic in my ear* what
1126 2018-01-06 21:33:18 Imo, no but have been saying since November their confidence was shot and their belief had been broken. Contrary to what some think, these guys don't enjoy losing.
1127 2018-01-06 21:33:05 What if it was olive oil
1128 2018-01-06 21:33:04 CA Governor Jerry Brown promised to fight this administration whenever it took actions that did not benefit the people of California and the nation. His latest action,to permit oil and gas drilling on the Pacific Coast, does just that; the people of CA will not benefit from this.
1129 2018-01-06 21:33:02 How to people watch Oil and NOT smoke? -
1130 2018-01-06 21:32:54 Too much hassle doing it myself anymore. Dealer always sending me special deals on it. Can get oil change, tire rotation and inspection done for $40. Saves me from the getting rid of oil etc plus not crawling around on ground
1131 2018-01-06 21:32:44 If the U.S. does have regime change in Iran the Iranian people/Goverment still will not let the big oil companies in and they will still have their nuclear program !
1132 2018-01-06 21:32:38 Anyone can win it with oil money as Man City have proven.   He played a bit part role in their title win and ultimately won’t be remembered by their fan base.
1133 2018-01-06 21:32:02 Fair. I also think it’s fair to question how good 33 is. Yet.
1134 2018-01-06 21:32:01 If Patagonia was an oil company, you would be deep-kissing them.
1135 2018-01-06 21:31:55 I’m flipping over to the Titans / KC game.
Go Titans!!
Sorry Oil. Not much excitement today. Maybe better against the hawks? Let’s hope.
1136 2018-01-06 21:31:51 Back from the sauna

I'm smooth and shiny with baby oil now.
1137 2018-01-06 21:31:38 me n my oil rig are unstoppable 
1138 2018-01-06 21:31:28 Save %. He was the worse starter in the West before Christmas. He’s been better but the bar was pretty low. He was hovering around 900
1139 2018-01-06 21:31:23 anybody tryna pay for my oil change lolol
1140 2018-01-06 21:31:22 Someone put an oil rig in front Donnie’s Florida resort.
1141 2018-01-06 21:31:19 ... in a pan with oil
1142 2018-01-06 21:31:17 loooove how my car rides after an oil change
1143 2018-01-06 21:31:13 The end is near for the Todder in Oil Town.
1144 2018-01-06 21:31:01 Nope, container ships, LNG tanker, oil tanker, bunker tanker and passenger ships of unlimited tonnage is my future. It depends on what I choose to specialise in on my 4th year (or 3rd year, can't remember)
1145 2018-01-06 21:31:00 Kalenjin Elders (in beliefs) believe that the 2009 Oil Truck Fire Tragedy Mass Grave at Sachagwan has something to do with the misfortunes of this Killer Nakuru-Eldoret stretch especially the Salgaa blackspot.
Calls for Communal Cleansing rituals.
1146 2018-01-06 21:31:00 Yes I also the oil regs caught Ferrari off guard.
1147 2018-01-06 21:30:59 Not addressing a flawed roster heading into the season left 33 no room for error and with an obvious downgrade on blueline. Management is getting what they deserve.
1148 2018-01-06 21:30:54 Great talk by @aquaticfoodwebs on husky oil spill effects on fish communities in the north Saskatchewan #CCFFR2018; few clear numerical impacts... see what the isotopes say. Stay tuned!
1149 2018-01-06 21:30:51 We burn absurd amounts of oil and coal in cold snaps like these - that’s not helping us with climate change.
1150 2018-01-06 21:30:35 I can trump you there - gentleman expelled from Reading Argos for trying to become drunk on olive oil...
1151 2018-01-06 21:30:27 @realDonaldTrump hey asshole no way oil drilling is happening on the Lost Coast of California. You just fucked up
1152 2018-01-06 21:30:24 I want some oil 
1153 2018-01-06 21:30:22 I literally use coconut oil for everything:)
1154 2018-01-06 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1155 2018-01-06 21:30:15 At cafe 422. Bout to get some linguine and clam sauce. Hot peppers in oil for appetizer.
1156 2018-01-06 21:30:13 I dont use software but I'm vigilant about checking. I had a situation at Christmas time where I wasn't able to get on for about a week but other than that I'm real good about checking.
1157 2018-01-06 21:30:13 Gotta mix that baby oil with the lotion weather.
1158 2018-01-06 21:30:10 Correction. Kabogo was a brand. WAS.
1159 2018-01-06 21:30:09 Oh, run with delight! Psalm 119:47, "I will delight myself in Your commandments." Oil supples the joints and makes them agile and nimble. The oil of gladness makes Christians lively and fit to run the heavenly race! "The joy of the Lord is your strength," Nehemiah 8:10.
1160 2018-01-06 21:30:08 fr hate getting an oil change lmao my ass be walking around walmart all day riding the bikes and shit
1161 2018-01-06 21:29:45 BFD: HAZMAT Level 2... 16 Tennis Rd Mattapan over 100 gallons oil spilled in basement.
1162 2018-01-06 21:29:41 To make tonkatsu, you put your finger in this oil like thiアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアアーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
1163 2018-01-06 21:29:30 Actually the war against the middle east is to secure our hold on Saudi Oil.
1164 2018-01-06 21:29:29 I think most fans can see the flaws in the roster construction and saw them coming into the season.  That said many don’t feel the need to relive the those mistakes everyday.  The constant negativity from many “vocal” fans only serves to unite them in misery
1165 2018-01-06 21:29:27 Didn't you vote to open ANWR to oil & gas exploration? Aren't you being just a wee bit hypocritical here? You haven't served your constituents' interests in a very long time, and your acquiescence to Trump is despicable. #Resign #TrumpTaxScam
1166 2018-01-06 21:29:12 oooo! i use oil of olay complete moisturizer with SPF 15 sunscreen on my face and neck before i put makeup on
1167 2018-01-06 21:29:11 @EdmontonOilers should maybe put an ‘ask’ in for the next collective agreement.. ‘no afternoon games’ for the #oil perhaps..?!? #wakethefcukup #nomoresoundbites #nhl #sporting
1168 2018-01-06 21:28:59 Wonder what Gary thinks of the $440 million from the Innovation Fund (paid for by carbon tax) earmarked for Notley's "pet project," the Alberta oil sands?
1169 2018-01-06 21:28:57 I read the same thing, but if this report is right, Sassi was let go in the aftermath of Baku, the race where the rules regarding oil became more strict (harming Ferrari's performance in qualy in general terms), a rule change that'd be completed in Monza. 1/2
1170 2018-01-06 21:28:09 whatever you done.
someday it will come over to you.
deadline until you dead
1171 2018-01-06 21:28:07 Haha! I just got progesterone cream, licorice root oil for dark circles, & vitamin k! Hahahaha random AF!
1172 2018-01-06 21:28:05 My eyelashes got so nice after coconut oil
1173 2018-01-06 21:28:02 I spy a small town surrounded by oil wells and windmills. #NamethatOklahomatown @KOCOmarkie
1174 2018-01-06 21:28:00 Aaaahh
Oh no I lost the cap for the oil

1175 2018-01-06 21:27:55 اي جانب ايجابي !! هل عندك اي علم عن اتجاهات المملكة ف ال oil filed وافضل طرق تطوير واستخراج النفط ؟ او افضل خطط استراتيجية للمستقبل ف مجال النفط والغاز واش دور هذا الشخص ومن معه ؟؟
1176 2018-01-06 21:27:44 Fish oil, milk , and warm beer my #top3#necessities
1177 2018-01-06 21:27:39 I suggest you do that and you will see the same coverage issues happen time and time again. That's not effort.
1178 2018-01-06 21:27:35 *you
1179 2018-01-06 21:27:34 He has been pretty solid since he came back and even weeks leading up to his injury
1180 2018-01-06 21:27:28 What are you using coconut oil for at this time of the night ?
1181 2018-01-06 21:27:19 Gaskia ka hadu,I will feature in my video coming soon! Ana tare
1182 2018-01-06 21:27:19 1Samuel 16:1 "Now the Lord said to Samuel,“How long will you grieve over Saul,since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go; I will send you to Jesse"
1183 2018-01-06 21:27:15 Will be interesting how investors and policy makers, in relevant countries, prioritise oil, gas and nuclear once coal is gone.
1184 2018-01-06 21:26:57 You tried covering your body with oil before masturbating? Or discreetly playing with yourself in public?
1185 2018-01-06 21:26:57 Or time to just package up the 1st round pick with a prospect and sell at at a premium since everybody knows the Oil will be in the lottery.
1186 2018-01-06 21:26:36 Again, that can't be the ask every period and it would help if they scored the odd goal. Don't get me wrong, he hasn't been great this yr but I don't see Oilers giving him any kind of run support.
1187 2018-01-06 21:26:30 What about lavender oil, u tried that?
1188 2018-01-06 21:26:29 Totally agree Jen. She's no oil painting either! The cheek of her making comments about Ann's looks! X
1189 2018-01-06 21:26:27 Early in the year is what has helped compound what we now see.
1190 2018-01-06 21:25:53 I wana be fit but veggies and I is like oil and water
1191 2018-01-06 21:25:40 I just use hot water, coconut oil & dish soap!
1192 2018-01-06 21:25:17 I missed the first, it's been all Oil since I turned it on. I doubt we come back, but maybe we can get close
1193 2018-01-06 21:25:00 She is all party, if the time comes for a vote, Maine can kiss her ass. If the people of Maine havent figured that out, they deserve to have oil and tar balls floating on their coast. Trust me, it aint pretty. I live near the Gulf Coast
1194 2018-01-06 21:24:55 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1195 2018-01-06 21:24:52 Use less oil!
1196 2018-01-06 21:24:49 Couple min* also if you have her do this tell her to add oil to the pan before frying
1197 2018-01-06 21:24:38 if there’s one thing i love more than oil painting it’s being covered in oil paint
1198 2018-01-06 21:24:08 The smell of the hot oil before putting the frijoles in is my favorite omgggg
1199 2018-01-06 21:23:56 Sure but again, what kind of goals are we talking about. Many were stinkers early in the yr but that hasn't been the case in sometime.
1200 2018-01-06 21:23:56 if you have some essential oils, peppermint oil is A1. put it behind your ears and around your neck. i also put a little dab under my nose to help breath. also, just eating a spoon of raw honey is PRIME for getting better. doesn’t taste great but it works magic!!
1201 2018-01-06 21:23:52 “They say putting cannabis oil in the vape is really good for you” HAHAHAHA yo jenn really got me crying 
1202 2018-01-06 21:23:51 True but Talbot is supposed to be a Vezina contender and a record-setting winner based on last season. He has been inconsistent and average (closer to bad than good) this season. Talbot comes up with a big save on 1 of those 3 goals in first period and maybe it's different story.

1205 2018-01-06 21:23:31 I drunk up all the Nupe juice and ice water... lots of omega oil too at one point. Blu juice was like.. a hidden gwm. Lol
1206 2018-01-06 21:23:24 The fact people don’t recognize this boggles my mind. Terribly put together hockey team. One guy on each line deserves to play on it.
1207 2018-01-06 21:22:59 Wolff is a modern day snake oil salesman getting rich selling hysterical Libs his book as the cure for Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS). Instead it is hearsay and wishful thinking that he even admits is not all true designed to capitalize on these TDS lost souls.
1208 2018-01-06 21:22:45 I need to oil my scalp so bad.
1209 2018-01-06 21:22:40 I'm slathered in peppermint oil to soothe me and I am a slimy fish.
1210 2018-01-06 21:22:29 U.S. on Track to Record Oil Production This Year
1211 2018-01-06 21:22:27 Use coconut oil sis
1212 2018-01-06 21:22:24 I been out since 8am .. I'm so tired but I gotta get these tires put on my car & oil change
1213 2018-01-06 21:22:15 I need to learn how to change my own oil nobody got time to be sitting in this place all fucking day
1214 2018-01-06 21:21:59 Today I didn't even wear makeup to work. I cleaned my brows up, used some coconut oil&toner on my face and some lipgloss. Cause my skin
1215 2018-01-06 21:21:58 Sure but if you're expecting anything more than that, you're not being realistic. Needs help at one end of the rink or the other.
1216 2018-01-06 21:21:53 Can someone tell me where India done his research on how women behave and yes ppl i said he cus when since women oil up der tits in front of millions of ppl #Eurgh #CBB
1217 2018-01-06 21:21:53 I be in the candle incense and oil aisle forever
1218 2018-01-06 21:21:28 .... I also recall 33 allowing many a goal early in games this season. Doesn’t help.
1219 2018-01-06 21:21:28 Hopefully they will place several oil rigs in front of mar-a-largo.
1220 2018-01-06 21:21:24 If you got a letter promising no oil spills, would you then be in favor of it?
1221 2018-01-06 21:21:23 up until now it has been smoke and mirrors but now i feel the time is right to spread this to the massess :-). #PYC rise inbound backed by solid fundamentals and an ever rising oil price....
1222 2018-01-06 21:21:20 After all how can solar panels (btw which cannot be manufactured without the energy of coal and oil) be more toxic then a naturally occurring mineral resource? What are your thoughts?  @kaptainsunshine
1223 2018-01-06 21:20:56 I know of one girl who tried to catfish me...I dnt knw maybe she thought I was desperate since I m child-free... She started telling me about how her dad was a CEO of an oil company and the uncle killed him to take over so now her life is in danger....& she needed money....
1224 2018-01-06 21:20:54 Egg yolks and chestnut violets with sauteed hot pink olive oil wrapped in soupy paste
1225 2018-01-06 21:20:48 I didn't know you call it dressing. So what do you call the oil +vinegar etc that you put on salads? (Oh and I love it cos it's delicious )
1226 2018-01-06 21:20:38 No worries. I've done so after battling autocorrect. Maxie is worthy of replacing as she is a Marxist. She slipped in front of Oil Executies that she wanted to nationalize the Industry. Straight up Communist.
1227 2018-01-06 21:20:34 Pretty obvious in this game that this Oil d-core isn’t nearly good enough. All six of them playing miserable
1228 2018-01-06 21:20:30 I guess I am in a time warp, I started watching the Oil today and it’s 2014 all over again.
1229 2018-01-06 21:20:06 We don't depend much on Saudi Arabia anymore! That's why they are trying to diversify their economy now and why oil prices are still low! Try to keep up!
1230 2018-01-06 21:20:06 Yes sir. A goalie can only do so much on a team that can't defend and doesn't score.
1231 2018-01-06 21:20:05 Embrace the oil. When it stops, the wrinkles immediately appear.
1232 2018-01-06 21:19:49 It's funny that the same people who oppose putting wind turbines out at sea are applauding potential oil spills off of OBX or Cape Cod
1233 2018-01-06 21:19:35 Sometimes I wish my mum wasn’t an essential oil guru bc the one she just put on my legs has me feeling like I’m being attacked by fire ants
1234 2018-01-06 21:19:18 A los sojeros les roban un poco menos que en tu gobierno y el gas oil sube para todos, ignorante. Y si le pusieran retenciones a la pera estarías de acuerdo? Y si se las sacaran dirías que es un regalo?
Quiero retención de 40% en dieta de diputados.
1235 2018-01-06 21:19:15 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
1236 2018-01-06 21:19:09 Pro-Tip. Put some Olbas Oil on a hanky. Let it sit on the radiator for ten minutes. Then huff that mother.
Now you can see all the way through your head from one side to the other.
1237 2018-01-06 21:19:01 Our previous President started 5 new wars, I mean ‘interventions’ & sent special forces into Africa for oil, I mean to look for terrorists, and Democrats were more concerned about his music playlist & basketball pics so...
1238 2018-01-06 21:18:53 Another game in which at title at glance the goaltender looks like the problem but in reality he is not.
1239 2018-01-06 21:18:51 Ginseng or ginkgo biloba IMO helps tinnitus, for some anyway; 
Maybe fish oil, vitamin e or aspirin helps too?
1240 2018-01-06 21:18:49 He probably uses coconut oil
1241 2018-01-06 21:18:47 taking away the rules and regulations by Obama will help in becoming oil dependent.The safety is still on every drilling site
1242 2018-01-06 21:18:38 As long as newsy sound bites do not endanger the overall profits of the parent corporations they are allowed.  Drug, political & oil ads are payoff, so news dept will not investigate misconduct.  General Electric own 100% of NBC. MSNBC is a NBC joint venture w/Microsoft
1243 2018-01-06 21:18:34 I got so much oil on my phone n clothes these dayss
1244 2018-01-06 21:18:22 My numbers are from OPEC. Remember that NNPC when producing crude oil operates a JV.
1245 2018-01-06 21:18:01 True but he’s been average at best this year.
1246 2018-01-06 21:17:54 Brilliant giveaway this would be so useful and helpful for me as I have very dry skin and my skin feels dull and its not radiant and soft. This damask facial oil would make my skin much better.
1247 2018-01-06 21:17:53 @Rookieon1075 Rook.... your Oil Rigs......They Stinks!!!
1248 2018-01-06 21:17:50 She is
1249 2018-01-06 21:17:40 Sucking so hard in sonic mania you can’t beat oil ocean
1250 2018-01-06 21:17:10 That includes 33
1251 2018-01-06 21:17:01 We are safe now. We have oil . The wood is wonderful but does not heat the whole of the house. Power on(touch wood ). Thank you.
1252 2018-01-06 21:16:50 Again, not sure why this is so difficult for so many Oilers fans to accept. This isn't an effort issue...it's a roster problem. Once you accept that, the inconsistency in performance makes sense. That simple.
1253 2018-01-06 21:16:49 I am not very familiar with military vehicles but as a leader, you know army officers drive around in vehicles with registration starting KA...
1254 2018-01-06 21:16:48 Yep. Tech that is so far beyond conventional, and apparently efficient that we have to deal with coal and oil and live among the filthy muck.
1255 2018-01-06 21:16:47 Well let's see, Hawaii is just a bunch of Islands where Obama was born so it can't be a State,
Alaska is only good for the oil, Puerto Rico is surrounded by big, big water. Obviously some stars are better than others.

1258 2018-01-06 21:16:15 Roast a chicken stuffed w/garlic cloves &cover in cumin, paprika &cayenne. Eat chook then put the carcass in a tall pot with water, all of the oil, spices &garlic from the roasting pan. Stir regularly adding water and wine ads needed. Cook for 2-3 hours. Strain & drink broth
1259 2018-01-06 21:15:49 invested in a face brush ( primark £1), use clean towels when you dry your face & clean hands, I have dry skin so i use Shea butter + a little bit of Almond oil to moistures my face after washing. dudu osun is good as well its a good start i've used it most of my life
1260 2018-01-06 21:15:22 Did you take some fish oil capsules ?
1261 2018-01-06 21:15:08 change oil
1262 2018-01-06 21:14:57 That must piss off your muslim donors in the arab oil businesses
1263 2018-01-06 21:14:52 Like Mrs. Onassis, Mrs. Trump is Redefining the Role, of Presidential Wife. After Eight (8) Long Yrs in the Dark Forest of Ugliness, She is a Bright Light of Beauty. A Pleasure, Simply to See and, Watch Her !!!
1264 2018-01-06 21:14:46 I also apply shea butter mixed with JBCO, rose water, coconut oil and lemon grass. Is that fine..
1265 2018-01-06 21:14:42 Fish oil.. 
1266 2018-01-06 21:14:38 Oil brain trust in Dallas.  Todd M might be on short leash.
1267 2018-01-06 21:14:37 Went to Organic Foods grocery store and bought two bags of chips a couple of ramen bowls and some oil and my total was $150. How ironic that natural ingredients are more expensive than processed? I’m just gonna be unhealthy.
1268 2018-01-06 21:14:28 At jiffy lube getting my oil changed & there are 5 grown ass men sitting in/taking all of the seats. Meanwhile, standing next to me is an elderly woman and not a single one of them has offered their seats to her & it’s bothering tf out of me.
1269 2018-01-06 21:14:26 LIO MOT OIL DJDKKS
1270 2018-01-06 21:14:18 ITS UR NAME.. also ig ur oil..
1271 2018-01-06 21:14:16 Flew from Edmonton to Chicago to watch the Oil play the Hawks. Any recommendations on where to get #InOne tonight?
1272 2018-01-06 21:14:13 Sadly, people buy this snake oil.
1273 2018-01-06 21:13:58 Bright. If Oil accounts for approx 80% of our wealth, not sure what you are talking abt. And BTW, i know what resources are.
1274 2018-01-06 21:13:58 Lol light dey
1275 2018-01-06 21:13:32 Sometimes you need to shut a door and walk, but you care for those you're leaving behind, so you oil the hinges properly so it's a quiet exit. ~ @Eloxie
1276 2018-01-06 21:13:24 The whole annual Israeli Hasbara budget is lower than the income of 15 seconds Arab oil production.
1277 2018-01-06 21:13:24 I’ve noticed that as well
1278 2018-01-06 21:13:12 He basically makes an Old Fashioned the way I do. I just like the smoothness of Maker’s 46 and how it brings out the orange oil from the zest. I also muddle a cherry in as well. Try it sometime.
1279 2018-01-06 21:13:11 It taste like oil straight upp

1283 2018-01-06 21:12:30 ***MULTIBAGGER ALERT*** #hyr this was trading at 15p and with a market cap of 100m in 2013, the down turn in oil has suppressed the price, but with 0 dilution and WTI back to 2013 levels i think this is going back to where it started, company in better shape than it was then...
1284 2018-01-06 21:12:20 Would actually love TMC to fade into a nice comfy retirement with his millions IF ONLY SO he could fucking torch the bosses who set him up to fail so obviously on his way out.
1285 2018-01-06 21:12:19 Every time I come to get my oil changed I feel like a fucking moron.
1286 2018-01-06 21:12:15 Who's tryna buy a car it doesnt start blow head gasket, metal in the oil NEW TIRES HEATED SEATS ALL WHEEL DRIVE!! PERFECT FOR WINTER!
1287 2018-01-06 21:12:15 With respect, you need to look at the entire country. I'm certain that no other state wants the destruction caused by crude oil spills, either.
1288 2018-01-06 21:12:10 
bath oil is finished !!!!!

and the horrific part , tomorrow is Sunday 
1289 2018-01-06 21:12:06 Haha. Coconut oil to the rescue.
1290 2018-01-06 21:12:02 May as well save Talbot for the Hawks
1291 2018-01-06 21:12:02 NO drilling for oil off the Eastern seaboard. Shore areas are natural habitats. And economic drivers for shore states. NJ has not totally recovered from SS Sandy. How much election funds did Trump get from oil companies?
1292 2018-01-06 21:11:57 Federal waters. California can't do shit. Don't worry, oil and gas companys won't do anymore than exploration because the next administration could be leftist commie and reverse the decision.
1293 2018-01-06 21:11:55 We did! That's why we developed the ONLY 'new' technology aimed at quickly stopping the next disaster! Guess what? No one cares (because we're not associated with the oil & gas industry). Even our government doesn't care & didn't contribute a dime to help us! #SoCalGasCoverUp
1294 2018-01-06 21:11:52 Yeah, but there's better snake oil salesmen who remember their bold lies and don't contradict themselves every other day. Trump became president by a tragic combination of coincidences. He's still a rather mediocre “deal maker“.
1295 2018-01-06 21:11:49 Okay summer needs to come back so I can wear skirts and oil up my juithy legs.
1296 2018-01-06 21:11:44 Mr @realDonaldTrump must be in silence. All this stuff is shadows over rise Oil prizes! And some other little dirty business @TheEconomist @business @JeffBezos @BillGates @WarrenBuffett @elonmusk
1297 2018-01-06 21:11:28 That was his bottom 1 moment easily. Look guys I'm making my first  gumbo but it's really hard in the FARAWAY LAND OF THE BRITONS, WHERE THEY KNOW NOT OF OIL AND FLOUR
1298 2018-01-06 21:11:25 Let’s not pretend Deep Water was a lone event. Let’s not forget 45’s goal is to dismantle regulations and will let companies do as they please without any checks. Please don’t be so shortsighted. Oil is outdated and limited, renewable energy is the future.
1299 2018-01-06 21:11:20 No word on the energy capacity of that 1.5 GW storage. Judging from recent Li ion installations, maybe about 2GWh. Enough to replace one of the IPEC reactors for almost 2 hours. Hooray! The dependence on oil and gas will become much worse.
1300 2018-01-06 21:11:14 @JeffMarek They need an Oil Change.
1301 2018-01-06 21:11:09 There are some studies that say Vit B1 can help prevent mosquito bites, but much of the literature refutes this.  Oil of Eucalyptus has worked very well in clinical trials--topical on skin. xx
1302 2018-01-06 21:11:05 it depends on two things:
- how much new blood enters the league's coaching ranks
- if the narrative is that Chia posioned the well. If that's the headline, then TM is fine
1303 2018-01-06 21:10:51 Unreal!  Do u remember deepwater horizon/Exxon Valdez.  Billion of barrels of oil polluting the oceans to this day! Further Trump admin has removed drilling safety regulations putting your coast more at risk. Can’t wait to smell the oil on my Alaskan Cruise.  Drilling is Killing
1304 2018-01-06 21:10:35 Switch to coconut oil. It has keytones which has been tested in UK to help.
1305 2018-01-06 21:10:32 thanks and trying:

1307 2018-01-06 21:10:26 I need to get an oil change, and my car cleaned inside and out lol.
1308 2018-01-06 21:10:26 I just get annoyed at the fact of sitting in pep boys for 2hrs to get my oil changed when I've literally have gotten changed within 15mins before.
1309 2018-01-06 21:10:24 Not sure Slep or Cags are legit nhlers let alone an elite centres wingers!
1310 2018-01-06 21:10:22 In general they are aligned with the worst international governments because they are a third tier power clinging to an empire they can't support and declining domestic benefits they can't afford due to a stagnant, oil dependant, corrupt economy.
1311 2018-01-06 21:10:19 Baby oil gel will do you justice in this weather, I’m tryna pyo
1312 2018-01-06 21:10:15 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
1313 2018-01-06 21:10:10 The snake oil salesman is at it again with another sincere speech on how the GOP really care about the people. Everyone in that photo needs to be Fired!!
1314 2018-01-06 21:09:59 Thanks brotha. Is the BM advance oil
1315 2018-01-06 21:09:51 yall this is mad fat but idc. so i love bacon but my man likes turkey bacon. that shit doesnt have any flavor idk wtf he thinking. so anyway i decided to fry his turkey bacon in the oil from my bacon and YALLLLLL OMG 
1316 2018-01-06 21:09:45 It's interesting how the behavior of oil market changed over the years. Inventory levels of the US and the demand of China happened to be the main drivers other than the supply side. The market was thinking US was addicted to oil. However, China happened to be the new US oilwise
1317 2018-01-06 21:09:31 Hask Argan oil
1318 2018-01-06 21:09:20 I am sure she is opposed. That one's a no-brainer. The question is where is DeSantis on oil drilling.
1319 2018-01-06 21:09:13 Marijuana is a great for migraines, anxiety, glaucoma, pain related issues,PTSD, many other uses! Not legalizing it showed Obama's ignorance and others who have it dangerous in any way! Please alcohol is worse! Hurts more people,harms the body! Hemp is a great oil.Taxes improve..
1320 2018-01-06 21:09:13 Lol but only the fish oil part

1322 2018-01-06 21:08:56 Yes, she was pretty
1323 2018-01-06 21:08:55 I stil think the concussion is an issue & their wingers suck.
1324 2018-01-06 21:08:49 ya it was 5×3
1325 2018-01-06 21:08:41 It’s lightly occlusive so I’d use it after moisturizer to lock the moisture in. Some people use it as a moisturizer (not me, it’s not enough), some only use it as a spot treatment for healing, some use it to reduce oil... It wears many hats.
1326 2018-01-06 21:08:30 Its oil that we use for everything  and ur good to go shit is so funny llol
1327 2018-01-06 21:08:30 Saudis lowered oil prices to deplete other nations oil reserves, reduce profits on oil sales & decrease exploration which requires tremendous initial capital. Royals were living high while profits plunged & cuts were made to Saudi citizens. Reg Saudis got fed up.
1328 2018-01-06 21:08:14 Aggravating all round then?  Not good.  Don't forget to try clove oil if everything else fails for the toothache!
1329 2018-01-06 21:08:11 I agree with you Rob and I have been consistent in saying that to last year, LB goes down early, has a poor glove hand and he gives out massive rebounds, which give the other team a second chance. Rebound control should be easy to teach, so should  not going down early.
1330 2018-01-06 21:08:07 But... no oil sooo......
1331 2018-01-06 21:08:02 Just put a spoon of butter in the pan after each pancake instead of spraying oil.
1332 2018-01-06 21:07:56 Hey, on the bright side maybe the Oil get Dahlin or Zadina! :) :):):):(:(:(:(:("(("(:(:(÷?*@€@
1333 2018-01-06 21:07:40 I just read an article about the new budget that made oil companies keep 9 dollars out of every hundred profit for oil spill cleanup. New Trump budget requires Zero lady. Absolutely unconscionable. PS. Love your Daddy.
1334 2018-01-06 21:07:30 They still have to pay up a goid portion..don't remember if he signed a 4 or 5 year deal.
1335 2018-01-06 21:07:26 Yeah, that's only two strikes with decent rosters. In the NHL that means maybe one year off depending on him.
1336 2018-01-06 21:07:16 I just read that you had the audacity (chutzpah) to claim God has forgiven your many sins. If I were a devout Christian, I would vibe deeply offended by your claiming this. Since I am not, I am just offended that you would try to sell that snake oil to your constituents.
1337 2018-01-06 21:07:13 True. Buts he’s an 8.5 million $ dog fucker right now!
1338 2018-01-06 21:07:13 And NOT dedicated to the oil and gas industry.
1339 2018-01-06 21:07:10 My coconut oil almost finish
1340 2018-01-06 21:07:06 Melanie is the perfect example of what a First Lady should be like. She is not only brilliant but also beautiful and is a legal immigrant. What more could Americans ask for to represent the USA?
1341 2018-01-06 21:07:02 How will all those new republican oil rigs effect the snapper?  With all do respect to your efforts Trump just made this look foolish compared to the upcoming damage -  you should be ashamed of Rep party
1342 2018-01-06 21:06:51 And not a word from trump about Russia sending oil to North Korea
1343 2018-01-06 21:06:43 Wow harna fara rawaa,irin wannan garabasaa
1344 2018-01-06 21:06:41 It's so annoying lol, next guy I deal with has to be a mechanic or at least know how to change a tire, twitch out a battery and do a standard oil change 
1345 2018-01-06 21:06:36 Clean water standards, environmental standards, education policy for my kids, defunding of healthcare & safety net programs, domestic oil spill of several hundred thousand gallons, horribly inadequate care of people facing emergencies in Puerto Rico, California, and elsewhere etc
1346 2018-01-06 21:06:29 Yep the advantage of having oil money
1347 2018-01-06 21:06:25 Okay if it is a perception that women can’t make it then why aren’t there more women working in oil fields? Not a lot of brains to work out there just need muscle and common sense. There are no barriers put up by men, you give me one instance in which a man said no you can’t go
1348 2018-01-06 21:06:21 Kind of a Let down,,, she was so elegant.. Smoking,,,,'' not so much''''
1349 2018-01-06 21:06:21 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities
1350 2018-01-06 21:06:20 Yes we know @POTUS sold us out to big oil. We knew it the second he gave them state department and didn't expect them to stop working at exxon....
1351 2018-01-06 21:06:04 They would be, but I still don't see Montoya as being an upgrade over LB. I would rather that they had given Ellis a shot first to see if he could handle backup duties. At this point in the season the Oilers are not making a comeback
1352 2018-01-06 21:06:00 My essential oil diffuser is my son and no one can tell me otherwise
1353 2018-01-06 21:05:57 I did N20 beans, N70 bread. Bread was the koko. N20 beans had enough oil and water to sustain.
1354 2018-01-06 21:05:52 The guy changing my oil is singing Fall Apart and not going to lie, the echo thing going on in this garage makes him sound good lmaooo
1355 2018-01-06 21:05:46 i’m so awkward at oil changes because i have no idea what’s going on i just know it needs to be done
1356 2018-01-06 21:05:37 I hate going to get anything done with my car because they try to upswell so much. Just change my oil and leave me alone.
1357 2018-01-06 21:05:29 I have coated my entire body in warm coconut oil
1358 2018-01-06 21:05:25 I love pesto because it's the most socially acceptable way to basically just eat pure olive oil.
1359 2018-01-06 21:05:23 In Norway, ''Because of the extraordinary returns on production of petroleum resources, the oil companies are subject to an additional special tax. ... 2018 these tax rates will be adjusted to 23 % and 55% respectively. This gives a marginal tax rate of 78 %.''
1360 2018-01-06 21:05:12 News: Parliament of West Australia narrowly votes to open province for emu oil drilling.
1361 2018-01-06 21:05:05 He was drinking deep from the oil bottle last night..
1362 2018-01-06 21:04:59 oil soil
1363 2018-01-06 21:04:55 Some Hebrew scholars translate 'MHRR DR' as flowing moringa oil and not as myrrh, and this is consistent with the Holy Anointing Oil being transdermally active - moringa oil facilitates transport of medicines through the skin.
1364 2018-01-06 21:04:49 Okay.  So what are you doing about most of the country's seaboard which is now at risk if being opened up for oil drilling?   High potential to completely screw all of our fishing industry.
1365 2018-01-06 21:04:38 I never understood Montreal trading away Sergachev. You could tell in junior that this guy was going to be a rock you could build around. Makes you wonder how come PC couldn't swing a trade for him.
1366 2018-01-06 21:04:28 it’s a disgrace... National parks and pristine shores are more valuable than their oil drilling plans!
1367 2018-01-06 21:04:24 Some credit to those guys.  But Oil giving it to them, entirely disorganized in own end.  Embarrassing.
1368 2018-01-06 21:04:12 I need to find and oil diffuser , for a good price tho 
1369 2018-01-06 21:04:10 I got lip plumper gloss and OH MY GOD THIS WOULDN'T HAVE MADE MY LIPS BIGGER IF IT WAS STRAIGHT PEANUT OIL HOLY CRAPPPP
1370 2018-01-06 21:03:57 i use keratin oil and i feel like it’s helped my hair a lot as far as breakage! & taking vitamins

1375 2018-01-06 21:03:42 Maybe I should have given u one of those oil blends for headache that I gave mom for Christmas lol, since she didn't want them anyway. At least drink some nice hot tea though. Ginger and chamomile are the best. Though you can also try lemon honey or just green tea if nothing else
1376 2018-01-06 21:03:40 This is sad news. Bruce Hood was truly one of the good guys in the game and an excellent official.
1377 2018-01-06 21:03:37 ofuckingkay because i didn’t ask you to do all that extra digging, i said just do my oil change 
1378 2018-01-06 21:03:32 McLellan shouldn't be out of work long if/when
1379 2018-01-06 21:03:16 Just got a full bodied massage with Jasmine oil #feelingrelaxed
1380 2018-01-06 21:03:11 Never trust a guy who doesn’t do his own oil change.
1381 2018-01-06 21:03:07 Radulov is proving Montreal wrong for letting him get away. I think there were those who thought his play would tail off after a big contract, but he has been a different player and person since he returned from the KHL, much more mature and responsible and a leader.
1382 2018-01-06 21:02:59 do not feel like waitin for no oil change
1383 2018-01-06 21:02:58 Toh yane,me zan samu ne lol
1384 2018-01-06 21:02:56 Absolutely!

1386 2018-01-06 21:02:43 What a good day for my house to run out of oil
1387 2018-01-06 21:02:38 I did not know that,,, Melania does not smoke....
1388 2018-01-06 21:02:25 Boilt boil oil
1389 2018-01-06 21:02:23 Really?  Major part of the article is missing. Did they use refined coconut oil or cold pressed. Unrefined, cold pressed is very healthy & won’t cause cardio disease. Please do proper reporting.
1390 2018-01-06 21:02:21 If your in the Kalamazoo area or near it, I do oil changes, ECM diagnostic, brakes and general repair. Hit me up if you need something done for an honest price.
1391 2018-01-06 21:02:21 very much so. I think she was mis-played on The Crown.
1392 2018-01-06 21:02:20 Because outside Harrods they got out of a fleet of Bentleys parked outside.  Good use of your oil money. Usually spent spreading Wahabism

1397 2018-01-06 21:01:50 I've been doing oil pulling this week and OMG. I've been mixing coconut oil w/ oregano oil and tea tree oil and lawwwwd I am alive
1398 2018-01-06 21:01:26 I wondered why it took so long for the oil to drain.....that pile of shrapnel is why. Lol.
1399 2018-01-06 21:01:22 I find that a week off of stimulants is sufficient to clear most symptoms of tolerance, while a thorough neuro-chemical reset takes 1-3 months.

Bacopa Monnieri and fish oil both facilitate dendrite repair and speed recovery.
1400 2018-01-06 21:00:50 Everyone on this thread is tweeting from computers or phones…that require electricity…which comes from oil.

Deep Water Horizon happened because of a company forcing short-cuts with their drilling, not because drilling is evil. But sure, let’s keep Saudi Arabia rich.
1401 2018-01-06 21:00:35 Gotta remember to grab this jojoba oil while I’m out
1402 2018-01-06 21:00:33 Paid my oil bill for the winter in October. I didn't give them enough
1403 2018-01-06 21:00:31 Yeah so I’m waiting for an oil change and it takes an hour and some change and guess why...they cracked my damn windshield

1405 2018-01-06 21:00:15 Monthly reminder to sharpen and oil your knives. The better care you take of them, the smoother and more enjoyable your cooking will be.
1406 2018-01-06 21:00:13 as long as you don't char them they are really pretty forgiving. like, if they burn a little, that's no big deal. the bigger problem is if the oil or butter gets burned, cause then everything tastes kinda dirty
1407 2018-01-06 21:00:08 Russia is the biggest single oil producer in the world.
1408 2018-01-06 21:00:02 Re Ocean Warming: Just think how wonderful it will be if the US starts drilling oil & gas wells. "Sick ocean needs an oil spill". Make it more fun and allow fracking - polluted water, pre-lubricated earthquakes (ck Oklahoma earthquake records after fracking). CONGRESS STAND UP!!
1409 2018-01-06 20:59:50 Never too old to change. I've decided fresh rainbow chard, sautéed with garlic (yes, with a dab of olive oil) & topped off with a squeeze of lemon is pretty fucking fantastic.

1463 2018-01-06 20:52:34 So far today, I’ve walked Zeus, done laundry, chopped down a tree and prepped the wood for a bonfire, read a few chapters & fixed mommas whip. All that’s left is my oil change. Then I can relax and enjoy my weekend. Talk about productive as fuck.

1465 2018-01-06 20:52:31 Health tip of the day: Learn to love your veggies! Eat a variety of colors, organic if possible & in generous amounts with small portions of meat & carbs. Helps you feel full. Sautéing in/roasting with olive oil adds flavor over boiling. Fresh is best but frozen is easy peasy. 
1466 2018-01-06 20:52:23 Listen honey!! Coconut oil for the soul.

1469 2018-01-06 20:51:45 All chip shops ebb and flow . The trick is to switch  when they stop changing the oil regular
1470 2018-01-06 20:51:39 Well the idea of liberalisation in Saudi May excite many. But is this some kind of heart change? Has anybody bothered to check how much oil is left in Saudi wells? @TarekFatah
1471 2018-01-06 20:51:34 Olive oil froze but did not explode!
1472 2018-01-06 20:51:18 Interestingly the sector is never addressed by the president. We here all about other sectors, oil for example but gold.., never!

If I sold you what looked like coffee, but you drank motor oil, you would be pissed, yes?
1479 2018-01-06 20:50:19 It's seeds in vinegar. Vinegar is already spoiled wine, so it can't become unsafe, although the oil in the seeds might get rancid after a few years.
1480 2018-01-06 20:50:14 So damn near every oil available. I love it.
1481 2018-01-06 20:50:14 @EdmontonOilers so the Oil are having goalie issues, so they get a back up, Montoya, whose numbers are as good as The other guys! Now down 3-0 in first against Dallas, times now to try him out obviously! Peter needs to shake this team up now before its too late!
1482 2018-01-06 20:50:12 I don’t do much! Wash once a week with anti-dandruff shampoo (target brand is the best I’ve found), condition almost daily with Aveeno Pure Renewal. And I use a lot of argan oil daily.
1483 2018-01-06 20:50:09 The minister was not telling Albertans not to eat meat. She was tweeting about a challenge. Obviously snowflakes fall on the right side of the road in addition to the left. Why no outrage about the oil & gas used in the plastic bags? Opportunity missed

1491 2018-01-06 20:49:07 Oh, I read the tweet, however, most couples I see these days the men are in the passenger seat busy on their phones and the women are checking the oil, filling up the tank, and swiping their cards to pay for it all....
1492 2018-01-06 20:49:01 what essential oil do you use in the water?
1493 2018-01-06 20:49:01 I boiled eggs and got avocados and spinach for breakfast this morning. Everything is still drenched in olive oil, but I'm sickeningly avoiding bacon! I may never eat bacon again.

Ps. $800 isn't a great deal but it's fair
1499 2018-01-06 20:48:14 yes, i've actually said the same thing.
Canada holds a vast amount of it.

1500 2018-01-06 20:48:08 “How do you maintain them now..”
Wash and oil. I’ve only “done” them twice. First time to help shape them. Second time I didn’t want to scare my son first time he seen me.
1501 2018-01-06 20:48:04 Surprise! The author, @cattaneooutwest is a hardline oil supporter.
1502 2018-01-06 20:47:52 Bright. Check your numbers again. It is common sense we are overpopulated. The per capita oil prodn in Nig is abt 200USD and Saudi is over 6k USD. Even if our leaders don't steal & Saudi leaders steal 90% of theirs, they are still 300% richer than us. U get?

1506 2018-01-06 20:47:22 Asia uses coal for power generation, the dirtiest form of energy. We could have been exporting LNG to Asia to replace coal. BTW Oil and Nat Gas are not equal in terms of GHGs
1507 2018-01-06 20:47:17 Archaic. Oil and gas is the past, and the poison.

1546 2018-01-06 20:42:54 I don’t fuss that much over moisturisers but a good oil might be good for you. Argan is good for dry skin. Use that after cleansing (and acid if using) then ur moisturiser on top to lock it in
1547 2018-01-06 20:42:48 I don’t want to do my oil change ..
1548 2018-01-06 20:42:41 The 1953 coup that installed the hardline religious facists was backed by our govt & CIA to defend oil interests. Bit rich asking Corbyn to wade in to something so nuanced imo.
1549 2018-01-06 20:42:33 Sessions is trying to run the small guys out of the weed business so big tobacco can scoop them up. Just like they did tobacco and oil.  @karenhunter
1550 2018-01-06 20:42:30 If the picture was a scratch & sniff, it would smell like PB&J and rancid fryer oil.
1551 2018-01-06 20:42:30 The good genes serum and UFO oil, only two things I’ve used and absolutely love them both x
1552 2018-01-06 20:42:09 Yup.  Another great start by the mighty Oil
1553 2018-01-06 20:41:59 Already tired of watching the oil game? We will have playoff football on the tube starting at 2:30!
1554 2018-01-06 20:41:41 Oilers gonna oil
1555 2018-01-06 20:41:39 vitamin e oil really out here solving all my problems
1556 2018-01-06 20:41:18 Why are you burning oil?
1557 2018-01-06 20:41:12 That is an idiotic comment. I've analyzed why Trump could be impeached & the closet thing is the Russian connect. This has proven to be a set up or Ins. policy of the DNC. If Rob were toprovide constructive arguement, I'm game. anything else is a waste of time. Party don't matter
1558 2018-01-06 20:40:58 Oil lookin great
1559 2018-01-06 20:40:51 Earl-I STRONGLY believe that this is a personal vendetta against Gov. Jerry Brown for the stance he has taken on California being a sanctuary state and on the environment concerning oil drilling on the coast.  Remember, only 5 days ago California legalized recreational cannabis.
1560 2018-01-06 20:40:34 BUT basically a cream or oil cleanser will probs change ur life. And you should just be using them with a clean hot flannel cloth. Liz earl cream cleansers are nice, Superdrug do a cheap knock off version if you don’t wanna £££ at first
1561 2018-01-06 20:40:32 I've been using concentrated hope oil and life is going pretty good

1571 2018-01-06 20:38:57 So, why no interest in helping us fight the BP oil disaster in 2010?
1572 2018-01-06 20:38:54 ppl should not love it. it's 75% oil
1573 2018-01-06 20:38:50 
1574 2018-01-06 20:38:35 I just want to remind everyone the Dems have no “grand plan.” They enjoy the status quo: high unemployment, high welfare state, no manufacturing, oil dependence, etc.
1575 2018-01-06 20:38:23 Sinus blockage? Try some olbas oil or similar....it should help

1577 2018-01-06 20:37:58 there is a lot of coconut oil in my hair right now. i smell like a tropical island that no one would want to visit.
1578 2018-01-06 20:37:51 Snake oil salesmen that prey on the mentally defective among us.
1579 2018-01-06 20:37:50 Shout out to all home heating oil delivery and repair folks working in this cold weather.
1580 2018-01-06 20:37:49 @DrNealDunnFL2 Dr Dunn we have heard from Sen Rubio & Nelson on their opposition to oil drilling in Fl shores. What is your position on this important issue?

1584 2018-01-06 20:37:39 Thanks hun  I managed to get it working this morning with oil spread on the bottom, then the stock, then the veg. Has yours ever burnt and cut out like that? Xx
1585 2018-01-06 20:37:38 Drill #oil , Mine #coal and export it all. Make US energy independent and then energy dominant. In the future We will control global oil supply and pricing. Make Iran fight Saudi and bump oil to $250 and make trillions exporting oil. At home use Solar + Electric Vehicles
1586 2018-01-06 20:37:36 More oil fields to be sanctioned this year as crude oil is projected to hit $60 per barrel.
1587 2018-01-06 20:37:32 @LAOEconTax why could we ever allow Trump to be elected?  Now we have it - oil taxes and 420 - idiots who voted for Trump are paying for it now.
1588 2018-01-06 20:37:24 Oh please it’s all about rich people. You probably want oil drilling off the coast too. Truly sensible. And I’m sure u think climate change is a hoax. Give me a break!
1589 2018-01-06 20:37:12 Was gonna get my oil changed today......then I realized how expensive it would be 
1590 2018-01-06 20:37:11 charlatan preachers.... most new GOP/maga folks are also evangelicals. It's been a slow insidious ideological creep of corrupted christianity starting with an embrace of southern televangelists and tent revival snake oil salesman, aka 'The Gathering''
1591 2018-01-06 20:37:02 He's doing that to diversify away from oil -- very conservative investments. Also, if he has to flee SA, his wealth will be waiting for him out of the country.

1599 2018-01-06 20:36:03 I laugh. When PDP had the opportunity to save during the raining season when crude oil was over $100/barrel, did they save? No. When a dollar was #160, there was opportunity to build foreign reserve,  Did they save? No!...Now d dry season is here, you people are opening ur mouth
1600 2018-01-06 20:35:58 Many Albertans have ridden the oil industry to professional success and personal wealth. Or would like to. They're willfully blind to the changes in their own business. I get it, but a head in the sand strategy is not an option, as you know well know.
1601 2018-01-06 20:35:51 I'm just here to tell you that I had a dream that Wonshik asked me to grease his scalp with coconut oil and I DID and then he and I got real fuckin cozy and flirty and no I didn't smoke or drink last night my brain just decided I needed to experience that
1602 2018-01-06 20:35:45 Softymo cleansing oil มั้ยคะ ไม่ต้องใช้สำลี แต่ถ้าแต่งตาเยอะอาจจะออกไม่หมด
1603 2018-01-06 20:35:39 But you can not generalize that all men are predators. But it happens as you have stated. Just like the STEM program, people generalize that women can’t make it in the oil fields or in other aspects on being in the STEM program. They are all systematic discrimination
1604 2018-01-06 20:35:34 I’m panicking! We have gone from a prospective Final Four team & by irrationally (unfairly)firing Rick, rendered them a bubble team (or NIT??) At what point do we take pitchforks & boiling oil to #UofL admin?? They did this to our team!
1605 2018-01-06 20:35:20 @offshoremgzn Quantum_|_Quench(TM) will be the technology to watch in 2018! Particularly when it comes to new high-limit oil and gas insurance policies.
1606 2018-01-06 20:35:12 Eh don't worry. Oil wills start playing and get de legs goings in de last 8 schminn of de 3rd.

1609 2018-01-06 20:34:41 Of course, far be it to ask oil companies that make billions of dollars to pay to help clean up their mess when congress can dump the cost on taxpayers
1610 2018-01-06 20:34:34 hahaha where is papa john?  pizza is not italian, but neapolitan, The rest is vulgar imitation. The pizza is made with mozzarella. olive oil, basil and San Marzano tomato, and you eat whole because it is light. The rest is superfluous and causes harm to health. Learn more.
1611 2018-01-06 20:34:26 As soon as the oil is gone in Iran, they'll be back to herding goats and farming rocks like the previous 2,000 years. The theocracy is running on fumes in Iran right now and they know it. #MAGA #IranUprising #IranianProtests

1621 2018-01-06 20:33:33 Told this madam I went to the east for Christmas, she sent me to buy palm oil, Oha and Okporoko.. Ladies are wicked!
1622 2018-01-06 20:33:30 Coconut and jojoba oil moisturizing session: 12 mins and that's IF I don't masturbate.
1623 2018-01-06 20:33:19 Hi, what are current oil reserves ?
1624 2018-01-06 20:33:10 SquirmDad is on a late-night run to Sainsbos to fetch clove oil, pain killers and anything else in the pharmacy area that looks like it might help!
1625 2018-01-06 20:33:07 just switched my shampoo to that garnier whole blends: coconut oil & cocoa butter. safe to say its over for u fellas
1626 2018-01-06 20:33:01 God blessed us with  oil to better our lives but today we are suffering and poor.  Money in the hands of few individuals who like to control others.
1627 2018-01-06 20:32:56 Especially because RU is trying to flee Petrodollar.
Trump wants USA on a strong dollar (relatively so we can export), w/ strong Petrodollar we keep World Reserve.
Pro-Oil Trump keeps USA energy independent & competes with RU oil prices. 
So why would RU elect him?
1628 2018-01-06 20:32:52 I have often wondered HOW states with legalized marijuana, other than strictly enforced medicinal, square up with federal laws??? It’s illegal & sorry, not harmless, I know from where I speak with a loved one ....CBD oil is effective and is much safer...
1629 2018-01-06 20:32:48 Powerful hurricanes were pounding N. America long before the conquistadors arrived. You’re the textbook definition of a snake oil salesmen!
1630 2018-01-06 20:32:39 You have marinated in the lie too long. Self awareness lost. It’s Genco Olive Oil Company mafia-esque front. How are donations these days? That might clear things up...
1631 2018-01-06 20:32:37 Trump & his Cabal such as the idiot at the EPA, believe & behave like the Snake oil Sales Vultures they have been in the Corporate Dens & Criminal Enterprises where Lies, Misrepresentations & Criminality as Long as one is not Caught, is a Valued Currency.
1632 2018-01-06 20:32:30 I even covered her food in coconut oil
1633 2018-01-06 20:32:24 might mess around & get some maracuja oil & be glowing by next week
1634 2018-01-06 20:32:24 Interaction with the oil price, and thus which fuel dual-fuel plants choose to use, is the next complication. If NG prices stay high then they tend to choose oil.
1635 2018-01-06 20:32:16 West is itching for a war with Iran... 2018 regime change bored of daesh & Syria Yemen...etc gas lighting & using ppls struggles for invested interests.... money money money oil oil oil
1636 2018-01-06 20:32:11 Make the switch to olive oil
1637 2018-01-06 20:32:09 Bubble bath with oil and a L
1638 2018-01-06 20:32:08 I'm referring to the aggregate accruements from selling oil at plus $100 p/bbl for over three years and the depletion of the ECA, and foreign reserves over the same period
1639 2018-01-06 20:32:05 Yeah, I saw that. Let's just say I've seen an oil spill too. Can't believe it. GOP dinosaurs are addicted to those fossil fuels, not sure why.
1640 2018-01-06 20:32:03 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
1641 2018-01-06 20:31:41 If someone tells you that you can’t fix a car door lock with olive oil and a mallet, you call them a liar and tell them to dream harder.
1642 2018-01-06 20:31:38 Boycott oil by getting an electric car. Boycott gas by getting a heat pump and solar.
1643 2018-01-06 20:31:33 You know it's cold outside when you find you coconut oil not melted for once...
1644 2018-01-06 20:31:27 Not only is the Trump administration destroying parts of precious national treasures,  but have lifted the ban on off shore oil drilling and fracking  . Is there no end to the destruction this man and his team inflict on our country
1645 2018-01-06 20:31:27 top and he was loose
1646 2018-01-06 20:31:25 I'd like to understand why we need more oil drilling instead of investing in clean, renewable energy sources?
1647 2018-01-06 20:31:18 Ironically we get most of our oil from Norway. RENEWABLES! Come on!
1648 2018-01-06 20:31:13 I use about a tbsp of coconut oil on my skin while still in my lava shower and pat dry (vs rub) Keeps my dry itchy winter skin at bay
1649 2018-01-06 20:30:58 What does an oil driller know about wars?!
1650 2018-01-06 20:30:58 Maybe Iran was naive at the time because "your project" was only beneficial to zionist regime not to Iran. The Oil wasn't for them, they didn't need it.

1652 2018-01-06 20:30:44 Seems like everything is. Damn. Olive oil is also. Arrythang.
1653 2018-01-06 20:30:42 Not a good weekend to run out of oil. 50° in my house 
1654 2018-01-06 20:30:42 You do not consider government-run free public health care socialism?
Or government-owned businesses, such as oil production or telecom?
Or strong labor unions and employee protection?
1655 2018-01-06 20:30:40 Mother, I write with quivering pen. Reports are that our Tiger unit will try to pass thru a land that is controlled by giant Hornets. Our unit of sheep tried to cross twice but suffered greatly. We hope the skunk oil you sent has the desired effect. - Morehouse
1656 2018-01-06 20:30:36 Not where did the oil come from ?
1657 2018-01-06 20:30:32 Mehn it's difficult to understand a woman! Bcos I didn't bring Palm oil for u from the east, all the good I did in the past is now forgotten
1658 2018-01-06 20:30:29 Having been born in California, it is and always  will be home for me!! I stand with you and all CA leaders in NOT allowing off-shore drilling! Continued use of oil in light of all "green" technologies is down right retarded!!
1659 2018-01-06 20:30:28 Deep Joy.

I was loosing the will to live and was considering pouring hot oil in my ears  as the Mrs watches The Voice.

Had a speculative look on @NetflixUK and Dirk bloody Gently series  2 is only available

Its all good man

when is that back on?
1660 2018-01-06 20:30:26 Same here, but unfortunately we can't Police the world, especially the Middle East. The truth is, the USA have had Iran on the hit list for decades. They're desperate to take control of their oil, much like Iraq. Open your eyes ffs!
1661 2018-01-06 20:30:09 The UK economy hasn't fired on all cylinders for a while (no USA V8 or V12 either). After y2000 peak oil, then y2007 net oil importer, the UK focused on housing / consumer / "wealth effect" economy (driven by Migration), low R&D compared to USA
1662 2018-01-06 20:29:58 Why do a lot of naturals hate coconut oil? My curls flourish off it 
1663 2018-01-06 20:29:57 #Dear2018
Adjust driving to the driving conditions and environment
If it is raining, turn headlights and windscreen wipers on reduce speed  try not to brake suddenly
There maybe oil and petrol on the road, which can cause you to skid out of control

1664 2018-01-06 20:29:57 Hilarious
1665 2018-01-06 20:29:53 Has anyone heard of oil slick hair & know if a lot of hair dressers do it????
1666 2018-01-06 20:29:51 Liar, we support his decision. Peak oil anyone?
1667 2018-01-06 20:29:41 I've always believed that #MustardOil is the only oil for deep-frying. With any other oil, you will get either an awful taste, or a build-up of dangerous trans-fats and cancer-causing chemicals, or a tasteless oily mess with the flavours killed.
1668 2018-01-06 20:29:41 I love how my sister is going to Baylor but doesn’t know a car needs oil
1669 2018-01-06 20:29:28 You should support nationalization of the oil industry then.
1670 2018-01-06 20:29:22 What I should do: go get my oil changed.

What I want to do: lay in bed and watch football.

One of these will win.
1671 2018-01-06 20:29:11 Keitu just poured fresh cooking oil all over her body.  This one needs another full bath
1672 2018-01-06 20:29:03 My face is sooooooo dry this winter  @mydrunkelephant Marula Oil is legit saving my skins life!!!
1673 2018-01-06 20:29:00 Put oil on the floor then tell him that something bad is happening then he can slip
1674 2018-01-06 20:28:44 Drink this good ol cappuccino and play this game while I get an oil change
1675 2018-01-06 20:28:43 Okay. I’ve roasted them with olive oil and season salt and pepper and I just wasn’t a fan
1676 2018-01-06 20:28:39 The proof is that many Albertans blame the NDP gov't for the loss of oil jobs when it's the industry itself that caused the supply glut that led, ultimately, to the loss of oil jobs. Albertans are naively convinced that the oil industry has their best interests at heart.
1677 2018-01-06 20:28:32 3) The US sticks its nose in other country’s business. We have invaded, taken out undesirables, armed warring nations, controlled oil in other countries, tromped on the rights of others here (NAs and Blacks in particular) while pointing fingers at others
1678 2018-01-06 20:28:27 He is a FAKE, because the snake oil salesman Trump called him that, Rocket man called Donald, Dotard and it fit him
1679 2018-01-06 20:28:14 Citgo is owned by PDV America, Inc. and headquartered in Houston, Texas. However, PDV America, Inc. is a subsidiary of PetrÃ³leos de Venezuela, S.A., the national oil company of Venezuela. PDV acquired a 50% holding in 1986 and the remaining 50% in 1990.
1680 2018-01-06 20:28:02 dang i forgot to grab vegetable oil for my bday cake, guess ill have to run back out in a bit :u
1681 2018-01-06 20:27:52 Go coconut oil, its medium chain fatty acids are less likely to be stored as fat by the body.
1682 2018-01-06 20:27:46 If trump wants to auction off our coast, then why don’t we, the people of California, buy it? If an oil Corp can “buy” the rights to destroy it, we should be able to buy it to protect it. #ProtectOurCoast
1683 2018-01-06 20:27:37 The CBD oil may help, though. And you’ll be ok on your ua-no thc. And, you can get it online, not too expensive. Cheaper than rx’s. Legal except in SD, $29/1 oz bottle.

1688 2018-01-06 20:27:10 Recently paid 2.59 per gallon for oil. Also supplement with a wood stove. In the past week oil prices have risen about 30 cents per gallon due to demand. Grateful I can afford, but there have been times...

1759 2018-01-06 20:19:26 Maybe. Depends on the shape of the supply curves for gas and oil, and their combined effects on the electric supply curve (translated through heat rates, etc.). Thus modeling necessary.

1801 2018-01-06 20:14:58 So how many citizens are going to give up heating with oil, stopped using buses, cars, planes? No place is good to drill but Americans won't give up oil dependence.

1816 2018-01-06 20:13:43 Fucking, found an oil leak when I got my new to me tire, I need to get a new car 
1817 2018-01-06 20:13:39 This is an unnecessary risk, we are still working through a glut, and this will additionally shut down shale oil production in the Dakota.
1818 2018-01-06 20:13:17 unknowledgeable, fake healthy people love cooking with coconut oil, not knowing that it has the highest level of saturated fat out of any other cooking oil, lol.

1821 2018-01-06 20:13:00 Is there even oil there @realDonaldTrump ? Here's a thought.. why don't you get those tiny hands of yours to reach down some holes in the beach and check for us.. you'll do a #tremendous job
1822 2018-01-06 20:12:58 Government wants to buy people's Land in Buliisa District to set up a central Oil processing facility but they are offering
 
UGX 3.5 M per an acre of Land!!!
1823 2018-01-06 20:12:50 May be they can make a pop up version of how oil drilling decimates nature and wild life!! And 5at perhaps using less energy and more green energy may be better! May also create jobs for those willing to retrain!
1824 2018-01-06 20:12:44 And #KochPenceWH  OK's Coastal Oil Drilling
1825 2018-01-06 20:12:43 The dealership sent me an email for an oil change, that would make the service cost more than normal. Good job.
1826 2018-01-06 20:12:42 Sorry, with all the terrorism-funding oil fiefdoms propping up tinpot football clubs, it's easy to lose track.
1827 2018-01-06 20:12:37 Politician dey thief instead of to find them, dey say na my phone consign dem!

1828 2018-01-06 20:12:12 "I want an oil diffuser" I have bronchitis so this wouid really help me
1829 2018-01-06 20:12:06 There must have been 'influence' from Oil Inc via TopGear over the years. The show was a massive PR tool for the industry for years! Can not wait for EV to generate volume sales and have significant money for marketing, things will change a lot then 
1830 2018-01-06 20:11:44 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
1831 2018-01-06 20:11:38 But some sort of ease oil too?
1832 2018-01-06 20:11:36 But ... you never had an ego-maniacal, insane, greedy, cares less about consequences or what people think orange orangutan in the oval office to fight, huh? You and the rest of congress could have stopped this
& your greed got you, instead ...
Welcome to tRump Oil
1833 2018-01-06 20:11:07 Now you all can see what tens of thousands of us who lost our children to illegal immigrants go through on a daily basis. The government aids and abets the illegal population to take America over. Weve become so weak as citizens we allow this to go on.
1834 2018-01-06 20:11:00 Clove oil, ‘parently. Our Mum hates it, but its meant to work or 
1835 2018-01-06 20:10:55 Not imidiate help but our Westie CLG was prone to alergies and poorly ears she been having spoon of coconut oil - runny or solid on food every am and these have been 99% eradicated - you prob know about it being good for dogs but thought I would mention- also good for digestion x
1836 2018-01-06 20:10:54 I love the scent of argan oil so much
1837 2018-01-06 20:10:51 하.. 얼마나 소중한지 깊이 와닿는 답변입니다.. (뭉클)
1838 2018-01-06 20:10:48 I didn’t vote for Trump either. But I see results the media won’t cover properly: courts, taxes, deregulation, oil drilling, Iran deal, North Korea, ISIS, border security, cutting $ to UN/USAID/Pakistan, restoring civil rights on Universities, and higher morale in military.
1839 2018-01-06 20:10:47 Just caught up on the new programme from @ChefTomKerridge . What a nice guy. And flavour combinations that I would never have imagined - sesame oil in a muffin - I have to try this! #bbc #tomkerridge
1840 2018-01-06 20:10:32 We need to get off the oil!
1841 2018-01-06 20:10:32 Or if you own an oil rig

1843 2018-01-06 20:10:16 Coconut oil is the solution to everything for black people.
Edges gone? Coconut oil. Skin breaking out? Coconut oil. Stretch marks? Coconut oil. Man leaving, make him slip at the door, coconut oil..

1846 2018-01-06 20:09:56 Until you Progressives come up with a cheap alternative to oil I'm good with this
1847 2018-01-06 20:09:50 They offer free oil changes with a lease. Except they don’t tell you that it doesn’t count for my truck because it takes do much oil
1848 2018-01-06 20:09:49 coconut oil is my savior
1849 2018-01-06 20:09:44 FF isn't good for this omnivore or  most people (health/religious restrictions)! I used to eat Wendy's back in my junior college days, but I haven't eaten from them in years when they started refrying their food in stale oil. 
1850 2018-01-06 20:09:41 Argan Oil is a life saver

1852 2018-01-06 20:08:59 In my opinion, why not be self-reliant. Why rely on OPEC to choose as it wishes. Drilling oil for ourselves will show we as nation are no longer relying on other countries, therefore driving down the price of oil per barrel for the rest of the world.
1853 2018-01-06 20:08:54 Vitamin e oil and sunflower oil are the keys. 
1854 2018-01-06 20:08:26 They'll just die in the oil spills from your buddy Donnie is allowing off the coast...if the mercury don't get them first from the runoff from the 'relaxed' regulations. Do me a favor, pat yourself when the back when you actually do something other than a photo op.
1855 2018-01-06 20:08:25 it takes a special level of Conservative #Arrogance / #Ignorance to continually do the bidding of the #oil mongers - the 1%, who've known for decades what the impact of ~7Billion humans burning #fossilfuels was going to have on the #climate that supports our civilization #cdnpoli
1856 2018-01-06 20:08:23 Make sure you use cleansing oil to take it off! Or makeup wipes if you don’t have any. The girl at Sephora told me to get this Clinique take the day off oil and it works amazing but it’s just annoying to add another step at the end of the day lol I’m lazy
1857 2018-01-06 20:08:08 The reason I’ve been reluctant to share is cos: I don’t have a routine. My hair is mostly in cornrows so I can wear my wigs. I let it down down for 2 weeks at most. I wash it once a month  (don’t judge me). I use coconut oil and olive oil for moisture 
1858 2018-01-06 20:08:00 Nearly a billllllllllllllllion acres along the Atlantic coast and eastern plains could be open to potential oil and gas drilling under Trump’s new proposal to appropriate....wait for it ....90%%% of the Nation’s water/coastal regions

1863 2018-01-06 20:07:23 Well, I’m just glad I know how to change oil because I don’t have the patience for a dealership.

1865 2018-01-06 20:07:07 Didn’t expect to be hit back with that lmao. Yes oil is the only way now
1866 2018-01-06 20:07:06 I forgot to get Baby oil before I came in 
1867 2018-01-06 20:07:01 I hate sitting around while my oil is being changed 
1868 2018-01-06 20:06:59 When will my coconut oil be liquid again?
1869 2018-01-06 20:06:52 Random Remedy:
Instead of using chapstick,
use coconut oil.
1870 2018-01-06 20:06:42 You can do mayo. Olive oil and honey. Or egg
1871 2018-01-06 20:06:33 Good bye to rubbing eyes in the morning and oil based eye make up! Lol
1872 2018-01-06 20:06:30 I’m craving fried chicken but I don’t feel like cleaning up the oil and junk.

1875 2018-01-06 20:06:17 What type of skin do you have ? I have combination so I’m constantly producing oil so I’m assuming that’s why it works for me because it gives me a dowy look 
1876 2018-01-06 20:06:00 If you’re lazy and poor like me it’s just coconut oil, coconut oil, coconut oil. Plus it feels funny when you walk outside and your eyebrows freeze.
1877 2018-01-06 20:05:50 No problem, if you did have an oil leak you would of seen it in your driveway before you got your oil change. #Be Blessed.

Sounds like tough economic times are coming for Saudi. Electric cars by 2040. Oil will still be needed but amounts required will seem minute.
1884 2018-01-06 20:04:52 Oops! One of my worst kitchen disasters was dropping an 8l fryer full of still warm oil.....hours of mopping!
1885 2018-01-06 20:04:42 Also please don't bother about weather etc. The Pakistanies have already been compromised on gutter boiling, dirty water, chemical milk,cooking oil/ghee and almost all 2 number products in all the fields.

1891 2018-01-06 20:03:47 as a learning curve, you have blown all oil seals,. Great first attempt. Me! I have no airbrush skill. Nice!
1892 2018-01-06 20:03:47 I may work for Toyota but I have say that I’m impressed with how well my Chevy Cruze has held up. After 125k miles the only things I’ve changed is oil, a timing belt and now a battery. Can’t complain at all.
1893 2018-01-06 20:03:27 Get her to pay for that oil change lmao

1898 2018-01-06 20:02:30 Mix the potato with the onions/garlic/carrots, (oops, which were cooked in oil *and* butter). Add the reserved potato water and simmer together 5 mins. 

Then add leaves of 3 sprigs mint, chopped, and picked leaves of a large bunch tarragon. Cook 3 mins.
1899 2018-01-06 20:02:21 Had one on an open face in the seventies and it did make you look good;  the only let down was the c 15  - more oil leaks than bhp!
1900 2018-01-06 20:02:20 You’re proving my point. The oil companies say if we do this pipeline the US will be energy independent. I know we get a big share of our oil from Canada.
1901 2018-01-06 20:02:14 You do realize the oil won't even be  slated to be used in the USA. But our coastal communities will definitely pay the price when spills occur. And spills will occur.

1911 2018-01-06 20:01:31 Now if we could dim some of these outrageous oil field lights around here...
1912 2018-01-06 20:01:25 You can completely stop using oil by switching to renewable energy and also not worry about what it will cost to buy water if the water supply gets contaminated by oil
1913 2018-01-06 20:01:12 Cool. But there is nothing wrong with that piece in isolation. And at some point soon we're going to have to stop using oil.
1914 2018-01-06 20:01:08 You're all for offshore oil drilling as long as it's not in your back yard
1915 2018-01-06 20:01:06 Apply some ginger oil, it will be alright!

1921 2018-01-06 20:00:19 Would not surprise me at all, she lived on the public dime for almost 2 years after her father’s death and still has control of most of the oil assets. It’s a point of contention between her and Maduro.

1923 2018-01-06 20:00:05 In 2003 all petroleum experts, without exception, thought we were looking at ~$300/bbl oil during this decade. Luckily, we got lucky and developed shale technology so you can comfortably criticize the war in hindsight as a mistake.

1925 2018-01-06 19:59:46 That I agree on. India rates cuts over, inflation troughed.. fiscal worse.. trade balance could get worse given oil... politics on margin priced to perf.

1938 2018-01-06 19:58:20 You need to go down and look at Texas beaches, the oil balls everywhere so you have to wear shoes, the trash washing up, etc. Not to mention the sidewalks caked with oil. I just hope it washes up on his beach in Florida. The Outer Banks will never be the same.
1939 2018-01-06 19:58:19 For a long time I've been keeping an eye on our interactions with Iran. I encourage everyone to do so. That Russian oil will be worth a lot more, with Iran out of the equation.

1941 2018-01-06 19:57:42 The value of the market cap is not how much money there is but how much people are willing to pay.  Knowing how much oil there is in the ground doesn’t depreciate the value. 800 billion dollar mk reflects demand not money. $crypto has a lot of growing up to do.

1949 2018-01-06 19:56:48 Bright, when you seat down and do the numbers, you will find that we don't have the resources. Do you know that Nigeria has the lowest crude oil production per capita if compared to top 30 producers?
1950 2018-01-06 19:56:38 Nigga look like he change oil and pressure clean roofs.
1951 2018-01-06 19:56:30 Is this redness due to cold or rosacea? My all time favorite oil for the skin is helichrysum. Frankincense is also good. For a carrier oil to use as a serum/elixir, I'm rather fond of marula - you can get it off of Amazon.
1952 2018-01-06 19:56:30 Got coconut oil in my hair & a face mask on 
1953 2018-01-06 19:56:24 No one understands schedules anymore. First my sponsor scheduled a meeting last night he knew I wouldn’t make and gave me an out. Then today h calls and wants to do 3:00, which just blows the whole day. 2:35 he texts that he wants to move it until 3:30 because oil light is on.
1954 2018-01-06 19:56:17 He always has dry spells though! Last year in January, February and March he started every game and got 1 goal in that period. Same as oIl, isn't consistent enough to cost that price
1955 2018-01-06 19:56:13 Something like that. 

About to put it into a vape oil. 


1956 2018-01-06 19:56:06 Coconut oil is doing wonders for my skin.
1957 2018-01-06 19:56:00 I am! My fuel heating oil is gonna run out if we don’t get a normal winter soon! Plus I can’t see out of my car windows and need a car wash
1958 2018-01-06 19:55:53 Also with eggs and oil.
1959 2018-01-06 19:55:51 No prob. Since yesterday you will have a wonderful view of nothing but oil platforms on all the coasts. Brought to u by Exxon and 45
1960 2018-01-06 19:55:41 I can’t believe there’s a city fan accusing Liverpool as not being a relevant club. They are an oil funded club and nothing more
1961 2018-01-06 19:55:41 Here come more #Fraud and stealing on behalf of #RedWelfareStates from snake oil salesman @RepPaulRyanVP
1962 2018-01-06 19:55:39 Wolff is well known for being nothing more than a modern day snake oil salesman. His moment of fame will end quickly.
1963 2018-01-06 19:55:33 Just reading about the Braer Oil Tanker disaster, which was 25 years ago.. What happened to the ship,is it still where it ran aground?
1964 2018-01-06 19:55:26 The scent of lemon oil is theraupetic af

1967 2018-01-06 19:55:10 Right if I gave you a detailed report why it's pathetic it would take around 10 A4 pages. Here Goes a short one 
He took great delighted on a daily basis reporting day after day on GMS when Oil was devaluing telling everyone Scotland is to poor, Now it is rising again not a word
1968 2018-01-06 19:55:05 Still trying to figure things out myself, but for me, CBD oil helps me big time when I can't control my physical anxiety symptoms!
1969 2018-01-06 19:54:47 & 100% of Venezuelans r currently in poverty

Caused purely by Socialism

& B4 U say Venezuela isn't true Socialism read the Conistitution all 350 articles many of which contradict each other

Socialism Murders kills and impoverishes

Even a Country floating on oil?
1970 2018-01-06 19:54:45 glitter body oil was my best purchase so far this year
1971 2018-01-06 19:54:43 It's all about the oil pipeline. Syria's the missing piece in completing a pipeline that will crush Russia's oil business which will cripple them.
1972 2018-01-06 19:54:42 Been waiting bout a hr to get my oil changed 
1973 2018-01-06 19:54:40 And tRumps BFF Putin is supplying NK w/ oil & other resources while the Orange Dotard pretends tweeting insults is going to stop it!
1974 2018-01-06 19:54:31 You must not be used to it. Being Italian, one of my friends tells me I’m made entirely of garlic and olive oil.  (also this keeps undesirables away)
1975 2018-01-06 19:54:27 Oil money? 

We will spend big, sure, but then, again, the same cycle begin. Trying to find in the new player, fitting him in. 

A big setback to what we were building.
1976 2018-01-06 19:54:19 Yesterday while I was at the movies carlos texted me asking if you need oil to make ground beef... he really can’t live without me 
1977 2018-01-06 19:54:01 First, there is no energy independence. Oil and gas are traded on a global market. And second, we collectible subsidize energy consumption, why not agree to collectively subsidize clean energy production and storage?
1978 2018-01-06 19:53:55 Maybe he was referring to smart butter...or yellow colored liquid oil in a tub.
1979 2018-01-06 19:53:51 I know people have an emotional need to continue to believe the war was about oil. But no objective assessment of US policy on the subject since would conclude that's true.
1980 2018-01-06 19:53:45 All oil is just as damaging not just palm
1981 2018-01-06 19:53:43 burn the midnight oil ok k dah pagi
1982 2018-01-06 19:53:38 I can't wrap my head around the situation in Warri were fuel pump price is currently N200 and the driver thank God because it has come down as at today. @DPR while will the oil hub (Warri) suffer what they have and Abuja is enjoying what it doesn't have?
DPR go to Warri.
1983 2018-01-06 19:53:37 What delusional world are you floating in? Mr Mann brought this onto himself, no big oil or any other right sided agency. He did and failed

1985 2018-01-06 19:53:35 I’m panicking! We have gone from a prospective Final Four team & by irrationally (unfairly)firing Rick, rendered them a bubble team (or NIT??) At what point do we take pitchforks & boiling oil to #UofL admin?? They did this to our team!
1986 2018-01-06 19:53:22 Oh man I can’t wait to hear the same bs out of this olive oil looking lying piece of trash.
1987 2018-01-06 19:53:13 I’m panicking! We have gone from a prospective Final Four team & by irrationally (unfairly)firing Rick, rendered them a bubble team. At what point do we take pitchforks & boiling oil to #UofL admin?? They did this to our team!
1988 2018-01-06 19:52:57 Fact is the oil IS running out....

It's running out the pipes and will do for years to come.
1989 2018-01-06 19:52:57 Trying this mint oil on my fro and the tingling is magnificent.

1992 2018-01-06 19:52:40 Aye Walmart is clutch for doing oil changes and tire rotations
1993 2018-01-06 19:52:30 Ooofffff, Bram. All I noticed was how less smug he sounded compared to Bruce. Yeah, it wasn't breaking news. He wasn't selling snake oil like Larry either.
1994 2018-01-06 19:52:17 trump thoughts on how to help putins and russias economy for helping him win WH raise gas.prices. will also help republicans big oil donors at our expence.
1995 2018-01-06 19:52:06 C'mon Oil really need this one
1996 2018-01-06 19:52:05 that's what everybody thinks, but the crackers magically absorb it (my family's recipe uses a lighter oil, like canola)
1997 2018-01-06 19:51:34 Tell your friends many red oil like me is looking for yam . It's a matter of national emergency pls
1998 2018-01-06 19:51:24 "ice crystals"? More like a reflection off the chemical haze from blatant geoengineering... similar to how oil has rainbow colors when mixed with water.
1999 2018-01-06 19:51:23 We hopes you feel better my darling! My Mommy bought some CBD oil for her chronic pain, anxiety, depression and panic attacks.. it’s expensive but it works. 
2000 2018-01-06 19:51:19 Oil has appeared!!!! We will live!!!!! # bwahahahaha
2001 2018-01-06 19:51:14 The tipping point is $400 - a full tank of heating oil; a minor repair to your car; a trip to the ER - that’s all it takes to completely derail a life that was fine yesterday.
2002 2018-01-06 19:50:33 Oil, oil, oil.  It didn't work in Iraq and it won't work in Iran.  Killed a lot of innocent people.
2003 2018-01-06 19:50:23 Did you notice the oil sticker?

2005 2018-01-06 19:50:16 In high school I was so scared to moisturize my face bc I thought I’d break out or be oily and now I literally just put olive oil on my face in hopes of saving it bc my skin is in NEED
2006 2018-01-06 19:50:06 Have you ever been to Coal Oil Point in Santa Barbara? Ever wonder how it got it’s name? Because of the oil naturally bubbling up into the ocean.
2007 2018-01-06 19:50:04 I certainly wouldn't categorise a $4 reduction in oil price as a crash.
2008 2018-01-06 19:50:04 AREN'T "THEY ALL" PREDATORS 
JUST SAYING.
2009 2018-01-06 19:50:04 Need to scale up the unsustainable Palm Oil Boycott.
2010 2018-01-06 19:49:53 pros of coconut oil: my skin is a mess and i need it very much 

cons of coconut oil: the smell of coconut burned my crops and murdered my firstborn son
2011 2018-01-06 19:49:47 I mean, the engine is dry-sump, so they could put the oil tank basically anywhere. Why not put it right behind the diffuser? Better yet, put a hatch in the diffuser to make it even easier!
2012 2018-01-06 19:49:44 Stared watching The Runways. Old need needs a sugar scrub and some lotion. Can someone please give this man some coconut oil or something.
2013 2018-01-06 19:49:44 Make sure to head to the rink tonight as all 8 teams play back to back to back to back. The first game which features BSI vs Lucky Luc starts at 17:30. Followed by Baudry vs Hemp Oil @ 18:45. SASC vs PRP @ 20:00. Upper Deck va Binz @ 21:15. Hope to see you all there.
2014 2018-01-06 19:49:39 Right lol but I can get this same coconut oil at the grocery store for $8
2015 2018-01-06 19:49:31 Baby oil after soap, rinse, pat dry. Soft skin without sacrificing the Flames of Hell 
2016 2018-01-06 19:49:24 So as a kid I hated it when I had to use coconot oil cos it was supposedly for poor people according to myself and some peers but grown up I spend more on it than most of these fuckin chemicals in the name of body cream
2017 2018-01-06 19:49:24 So by Nationalizing the oil/health care industries in the U.S. and using the profits to pay for national health care,education and the development and implement of micro grid green energy solutions,we could also stomp out major sources of corruption from said industries? 
2018 2018-01-06 19:49:15 Yess! It blends into my skin flawlessly and I'm super oily but no oil breaks through until the end of the day (I wear it from 6am until 7pm). I dries very quickly as well.
2019 2018-01-06 19:49:12 Remember all those oil industry execs lined up in front of Congress, saying how they didn't need their corporate subsidies?
2020 2018-01-06 19:49:07 Gee I use wood and coal to heat my home because fuel oil is expensive due to the NYS taxes placed on it. We need a Coumo free New York.
2021 2018-01-06 19:49:01 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
2022 2018-01-06 19:49:01 I’m so high on menthol, lemsip and olbas oil
2023 2018-01-06 19:48:56 My hair and body are covered in coconut oil, I’m feeling like a coconut queen 
2024 2018-01-06 19:48:50 Iran Crisis could push crude to $100

Oil prices started the year on a high note as some geopolitical tension pushed aside bearish concerns. "Growing unrest in Iran set the table for a bullish start to 2018," the Schork Report said in a note to clients this week.
2025 2018-01-06 19:48:49 야호!!! 같이 아침을 맞이하나요( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2026 2018-01-06 19:48:44 Ain’t no more dripping I’m leaving oil spills 
2027 2018-01-06 19:48:43 They stopped allowing kids as visitors in our local hospitals.  And I have (had) friends trying to sell their snake oil elderberry syrup and crap to 'keep safe from the flu, because the vaccines don't work.' 
2028 2018-01-06 19:48:41 Feels like Christmas came again today. Got a smog check & oil change for free + an additional $280 gift certificate at that place so any work I need on my car this year will probably be for free.
2029 2018-01-06 19:48:37 Possibly, but not necessarily. If homes were heat pump heated, LDC gas demand would have been down, resulting in lower pipeline gas prices and more plants would have run on NG instead of oil. Estimating net effect would take modeling.
2030 2018-01-06 19:48:28 PSG & Man City dey use oil money do business. Watch him out in 2-3yrs. Plus how many trophies  
2031 2018-01-06 19:48:00 Paragraph 8 is quite instructive. The govt was clearly alarmed that the price of oil had crashed from $147/barrel to $143. Credit the PMB administration that kept going when the same oil fell to as low as $29 with militants' attacks reducing production to 1 million barrels/day.
2032 2018-01-06 19:48:00 All that oil cash was useful when it came to throwing all those coal and steel workers on the dole.
2033 2018-01-06 19:47:50 I love my rose hip oil so much
2034 2018-01-06 19:47:49 Sunrise Co-op is where we got it through their oil program
2035 2018-01-06 19:47:48 Nigga there was a time when i didnt have to get my oil changed pump my gas or clean my car... i need that again just attached to a nigga with some fucking sense ... i claim it... on this day!! Lol
2036 2018-01-06 19:47:47 My cuticles are so dry but fuck if I get up to get my nail oil
2037 2018-01-06 19:47:20 there is no price I would pay to put mineral oil on my skin
2038 2018-01-06 19:47:13 Who did you put in charge of everything, a snake oil salesman Trump, don't get it twisted
2039 2018-01-06 19:47:07 Clearly......you have not mentioned the air ambulance option....which does make you a bad parent, we all wish her well and the lavender oil option suggested by a great poster does actually work....it is a magnificent natural oil that my wife uses for all ailments 
2040 2018-01-06 19:47:02 Day 2 of Essential Oils.
Instructions: Mix w/carrier oil. will irritate skin w/direct contact.

Me: rubs on clothes and then looks like I'm smelling my pits when I feel congested.
2041 2018-01-06 19:46:57 Expect some amazing articles and interviews - #oil and #health coming this January in Cuba Business Report. Wishing everyone a great new 2018!
2042 2018-01-06 19:46:57 fuck oil and acne! we focusing on THE HEALTH OF OUR SKIN in 2018
2043 2018-01-06 19:46:36 Perhaps @realDonaldTrump plans to invade Mexico and take their oil.
2044 2018-01-06 19:46:27 Oh you know just sitting here in my house staying warm and then $450 of oil gets delivered like 2 weeks after the last $400+ delivery...
2045 2018-01-06 19:46:27 Oil
2046 2018-01-06 19:46:19 I don't get how people whine about their freedom to smoke bud being violated, yet protest offshore oil drilling。
2047 2018-01-06 19:46:12 Or do you mean the Islamic immigration ban that has conveniently left Saudi Arabia which has been known for breeding terrorists such as Bin Laden amongst others all because of oil and riches he will benefit. Nothing to do with security here.
2048 2018-01-06 19:46:02 well...could you imagine driving to Jacksonville, Florida for an oil change? that's pretty much the distance what it takes to get to Phoenix, the nearest dealership
2049 2018-01-06 19:46:02 Oil imports from Venezuela and Middle East. American trade balance corrects with many countries. See US-Norway trade balance. Since 2015 it is non stop heading in US favor. Still a deficit but with Model 3 the US will have export surplus with Norway.
2050 2018-01-06 19:45:50 Come check out our new soda designed oil rigs! What's your favorite soda? Fanta, Coke, or 7 up? Come pick up a rig to match your favorite drink!
2051 2018-01-06 19:45:39 My dogs dry skin has been makin me itchy and he’s been a ball of static electricity so I rubbed coconut oil into his fur... found out he loves the stuff and wouldn’t stop tryna lick it off my hands lmaoooo
2052 2018-01-06 19:45:37 A 'Civilization' that spends more money on bombs, military machinery, oil, & war than education and peace is anything but civilized. #NoWar #Peace #UnityNow
2053 2018-01-06 19:45:36 Or the M9 room deodorizer with mint oil poured in.
2054 2018-01-06 19:45:28 It's a few years old. It came out during Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Still worth watching
2055 2018-01-06 19:45:19 Gas cannot be pumped, it is compressed and transported forward through pipelines .
2056 2018-01-06 19:45:18 Finally got a massage and there was a lot more oil involved than i expected. Kinda felt like a greased chicken. Never before have i felt so appetizing
2057 2018-01-06 19:44:47 We can do extraordinarily good fish and chips!
-Battered Cod or Haddock 
-Grilled or Breaded Plaice 
With chips, homemade minted peas, homemade tartare sauce and lemon... all cooked in @CotswoldGold rape seed oil 
2058 2018-01-06 19:44:37 I feel ya, man! I just bought myself a humidifier and I've been alternating between using calendula oil and shea butter. And I continue to have hot showers! #canada #itscoldhere
2059 2018-01-06 19:44:12 Oh, just read your message about Golden Bomber and oil wrestling so I'm going to go watch that right now 
2060 2018-01-06 19:44:11 @PetroHome WORST COMPANY ever.. #buyerbeware Have auto deliverly contract and called at 1/4 of tank.. and every day for five days.. they are rude and careless.. I'm going to be out oil today and they don't give a crap.  Stay away from PETRO
2061 2018-01-06 19:44:04 Your are a great snake oil salesman, a con artist, a crook.  And you resonated on part of the electorate that wanted a change. If daffy duck ran for office he would have won too.
2062 2018-01-06 19:43:49 The fact that this game is a) against Dallas, b) IN Dallas, and c) an afternoon road game is kind of going against us considering our history, but let’s hope the Oil can show some grit, character and depth and get this road trip started out on a positive note!! #LetsGoOilers
2063 2018-01-06 19:43:40 Luke, high price means less oil. Less affordable, law of Entropy asserts itself
2064 2018-01-06 19:43:20 You don't care about having everyone get access to the land. All you care about is Big Oil and corporations getting access to make you money and line your pockets.
2065 2018-01-06 19:43:11 So bravo don dump. You accomplished the dumping of oil onto sacred native burial grounds.
2066 2018-01-06 19:43:11 What subsidies are you referring to? Ethanol subsidies ended years ago, but Billions of $$ in annual subsidies for oil continue.
2067 2018-01-06 19:43:11 Check your Transmission oil today.
2068 2018-01-06 19:42:50 Also: temporary diets are not good, better do it slowly by changing your lifestyle & the way you eat. No more vegan fast food (oil & sugar).
2069 2018-01-06 19:42:45 Gorgeous countryside! Makes me think of old hunting themed oil paintings or something
2070 2018-01-06 19:42:30 He is great at "selling you anything "   I think they used to call men like this "snake oil salesman ".
2071 2018-01-06 19:42:28 5m to 10m in a few yrs.  And at the right price of oil ($150? $200?) it could be 15m.
2072 2018-01-06 19:42:25 I imagine the hardest part of a Ferrari oil change is removing the diffuser. the engine is easy enough to get at
2073 2018-01-06 19:42:24 If the oil change took longer than 30 minuets, then it’s likely they created the valve leak problem. And the catalytic converter would cause the check engine light to come on, they would know that’s the problem from jump!
2074 2018-01-06 19:42:24 Gotta get this oil changed 
2075 2018-01-06 19:42:22 Don dump approved the keystone pipeline which he literally tweeted would "be good for the environment." Well it recently leaked 1/4 of a million gallons of oil in South Dakota. Based on your definition of accomplishments that should be included.
2076 2018-01-06 19:42:19 @realDonaldTrump PLEASE do not open the Gulf Coast or Arctic for oil drilling! Can you guarantee oil companies will keep up their blow-out preventers and do maintenance to prevent another huge spill that killed animals & humans? Start drilling near Mar-a-Lago to see how it goes?
2077 2018-01-06 19:42:11 Brakes and rotors: $100 max

Oil change: $20 max

Pipe replacement/seal: who knows, prolly like $150 max

=

$800??? 

With "more things that can wait until my next oil change." This car doesn't even have 50,000 miles on it yet
2078 2018-01-06 19:42:06 Looks like my engine has escaped the graveyard for now! It’s getting a full tune up and oil change, but there’s no permanent damage. Thanks Jeff!
2079 2018-01-06 19:42:03 @DebHedani
2080 2018-01-06 19:41:54 Ewwwww. Our #Public bakery foods are dry, tasteless cakes smeared with over-sweetened coconut oil frosting. They even use frosting in their cannolis! Horrible! No temptation whatsoever.
2081 2018-01-06 19:41:41 Now Now!! You know that's totally different 
2082 2018-01-06 19:41:13 Salute to your father for even managing oil changes. He's probably in pretty Elite Ferrari ownership Club company that does that by themselves
2083 2018-01-06 19:41:10 Delicious late lunch: toasted & sliced asiago cheese bagel, 1/4 mashed avocado on each slice, drizzle of olive oil, salt & pepper, and topped with half of hardboiled egg on each slice.
2084 2018-01-06 19:41:10 Why the fuck did I decide to get an oil change the same day as everyone in Hammond
2085 2018-01-06 19:41:08 Been at this car dealer getting my oil change since 1:30...if they not done by 3 we gon have some problems
2086 2018-01-06 19:40:56 However the expansive oil drilling trump wants will destroy everything
2087 2018-01-06 19:40:48 Probably all those damn tourists covered in oil distracting you.
2088 2018-01-06 19:40:37 I put the focus essential oil blend into my diffuser. I have been focused on Facebook and YouTube videos. Not exactly what I had in mind...
2089 2018-01-06 19:40:29 Alberta is adding jobs. Oil is stabilizing at higher levels. The housing market didn’t crash. Most areas of AB are coming out of the recession. These are good things no matter your ideological differences.
2090 2018-01-06 19:40:26 Luke, USA increased oil production from 7 to 10 million barrels per day in few years, but it still consumes 19 million per day, net importer. USA oil exports have to do with quality of oil refineries can process. USA still net importer
2091 2018-01-06 19:40:25 A day after Papadopoulos revealed himself as a Kremlin agent hoping to set up an illegal #TrumpPutin meet, Trump switched Papadopoulos off his area of expertise—#MiddleEast oil—to the campaign's Russian policy team. He did it knowing Papadopoulos was in touch with the Kremlin.
2092 2018-01-06 19:40:21 子猫なら…あっやっぱ無理っ(逃
2093 2018-01-06 19:40:15 my dad drives seven hours three times a year for advanced maintenance on the 458, he manages oil changes and stuff himself, but there's only so much you're willing to or even allowed to do with such an expensive car
2094 2018-01-06 19:40:10 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
2095 2018-01-06 19:40:09 Just cooked wors for the first time...
Look, if wors doesn't wanna be cooked it should just say so, instead of spewing HOT OIL everywhere
2096 2018-01-06 19:40:08 Uh I just got some water mix able oil paint that was 25 for four bucks it's a good day
2097 2018-01-06 19:40:01 have you got the lee stafford spray or the cream in the circle tub? I like using coconut oil but it never comes out of my hair properly x
2098 2018-01-06 19:39:41 im free all day tomorrow or we could schedule for this week? tarte has this oil I need to get my hands on 
2099 2018-01-06 19:39:39 Totally agree, Oil money has ruined the game.
2100 2018-01-06 19:39:09 The oil changes whatever it touches!
2101 2018-01-06 19:38:54 I guess oil has done more harm than good for this country
2102 2018-01-06 19:38:48 Poor beyond belief, lack ambition and desire @ChelseaFC bring back @rubey_lcheek immediately sell @TimoeB08 #KTBFFH #CFCFamily #Recruitment #EnglishTalent
2103 2018-01-06 19:38:36 About to get a car wash and oil change
2104 2018-01-06 19:38:28 If my cannabis oil hardens, I’m really going to be pissed!
2105 2018-01-06 19:38:24 Lavander oil on cotton wool, placed in the ear....... 
2106 2018-01-06 19:38:23 Oh my goodness. Thanks for letting me know. I'm so sad. It is my perfume! I love it. Just got the oil but can't wear that.

2109 2018-01-06 19:37:45 Restructuring can't tackle infrastructural deficit hence d need 2 fix d process rather dan d structure bcoms key.Restrucn. ll expose d state 2 more liabilities which d oil blocks' revenues can't address.Let d APC govt fix d deficit b4 restructuring
2110 2018-01-06 19:37:41 I feel so much better after inhaling an Olbas Oil infused bowl of water. Was so bunged up with catarrh earlier on today.
2111 2018-01-06 19:37:32 Big Oil knows all this new drilling will be shut down once Dems & sanity return to Congress & White House... Then, Big Oil will demand restitution for $ invested—& they'll cap off their wells as quickly/cheaply as possible—leaving behind ecological time bombs on the ocean floor.
2112 2018-01-06 19:37:32 US oil imports rose inexorably for 35 yrs & reversed them in under 6 yrs, driven purely by collapsing USD v oil price & some updates on 25-yr old fracking technology.  Deval USD enough & 20 yr trend would be similarly totally reversed in 3-4 yrs.
2113 2018-01-06 19:37:17 ..palm oil stains tho
2114 2018-01-06 19:36:57 Exfoliate real good and put a hydrating oil on before you go to sleep
2115 2018-01-06 19:36:46 There's nothing more sexier, than a woman that suggest some shit sexually i didn't know,  like baby oil gel works better for anal than just baby oil.. 
2116 2018-01-06 19:36:45 I Luv Vodka!  Spritzer for your linens: 1c Vodka + 1c H2O + 16 drops essential oil: to disinfect & freshen
2117 2018-01-06 19:36:40 yeah that guy is talking out of his ass. I used to make McDonald's fries as well and there's no pork near their oil 
2118 2018-01-06 19:36:34 Definitely feel like this mechanic is fucking me, there's no way an oil change, breaks, rotors, and a leaky pipe due to freezing temps are $800 on a 2001 Chrysler.
2119 2018-01-06 19:36:10 Yeah! It’s a bath oil tho so it’s different feom@a bath bomb. Mostly makes your skin super soft

2121 2018-01-06 19:36:03 100 on a oil change  my mama shit don’t be nun but 70
2122 2018-01-06 19:35:53 It changes everything, my night time routine is so important to me.. I diffuse my lavender oil and use all my favourite face products! Pampered and calm! #bloggerstribe
2123 2018-01-06 19:35:53 Not sure if you get your oil changed in the city, but you should go to Victory Lane next time you do in Highland Park, black owned & they never harass me about my car, I’m in & out.
2124 2018-01-06 19:35:50 Best get the baby oil out
2125 2018-01-06 19:35:38 I know how to put gas keep it clean & get a oil change 
2126 2018-01-06 19:35:35 Can tell you can't understand basic economics, while oil is low you want to build infrastructure for it, that's the opposite of what you do in a slump, during the boom times is when you spend. That's honestly the simplest thing and you can't understand that hahahaha
2127 2018-01-06 19:35:34 Thank you!
2128 2018-01-06 19:35:26 The oil delivery has still not here. I have been on hold roe 45 mins. We will freeze tonight.
2129 2018-01-06 19:35:24 The squeaky wheel DOES get oil. So thankful @WeAreFarmers finally is listening to us. Back to a hotel for a while until our homes get thoroughly cleaned from ash & burned storage units removed. Loud airscrubber machines are way 2much for my autistic son, too. #autism #thomasfire
2130 2018-01-06 19:35:21 Coconut oil is highly comedogenic and can clog pores depending on skin type. If you break out, don’t use coconut oil.
2131 2018-01-06 19:35:15 俺なんでこんな時間に起きてるんだろ
2132 2018-01-06 19:35:15 Sir have you also lost your mind?America watched this circus act unfold. You watched this bearded lady undermine our democracy & transparently unravel with shear insanity.
You have the power & it’s your job,  INACT ARTICLE 25. Or are you nothing more than 43s snake oil salesman?
2133 2018-01-06 19:35:03 I actually have some sweet orange oil! I thought citrus oils were energizing, though. Learn something new every day!
2134 2018-01-06 19:35:00 @TimoeB08 £30 u should be embarrassed @rubey_lcheek @ChelseaFC @RBarkley20 English talent is our future #BringHimHome #RollsRoyce #EnglishTalent #TransferWindow #Agent #KTBFFH
2135 2018-01-06 19:34:54 Sarah and Rex. The oil man won't be able to continue his slimy Russia plans and Sarah won't have the legit skills to cover Pence.
2136 2018-01-06 19:34:49 You're 100% accurate.

Pharmaceutical co's have/will do everything possible to block plant medicine cures; its disgusting!

I couldnt fly w/ CBD oil on me so I had to bring 10 different prescriptions; all of them at taxpayers expense.

CDB I pay/assume full responsibility.
2137 2018-01-06 19:34:40 Oil will be pumped and there isn’t anything the liberal morons can do but continue to cry and stomp their feet
2138 2018-01-06 19:34:37 I am expecting higher oil and gas maybe after small correction, I see .09-.10 from my Fibonacci
2139 2018-01-06 19:34:33 But it's perfectly ok to drill for oil in Alaska?  You're truly a #hypocrite.
2140 2018-01-06 19:34:29 Ohhhh...my father used to make French  fires like that in an casted iron pan. He used to put crumbs of feta cheese on top of the fries. We would also make a salad of fresh tomatoes, thin sliced cucumbers & slivers of garlic, dressed with olive oil, salt & pepper. Loved it!
2141 2018-01-06 19:34:26 Never doing an oil change at Jiffy Lube again.
2142 2018-01-06 19:34:09 One day the stock of oil will end but Salman's name will remain there forever in history... 
2143 2018-01-06 19:34:00 In those years the UK gov paid oil companies to extract, meanwhile the same companies paid Norway Billions to extract from same sources, so who’s kidding who ? Also tax at pumps is around 70% per litre, UK treasury even steals Scotland’s takings at pumps.
2144 2018-01-06 19:33:58 I’ll bust out the baby oil right now and we’ll have a flex off!
2145 2018-01-06 19:33:58 Only a #StableGenius would send Drones to demolish regimes holding onto their strands of Oil.
2146 2018-01-06 19:33:55 Crude oil prices are 60% reduced but petroleum products rates got increased with 30%
2147 2018-01-06 19:33:48 Just look to the North Sea between Britain, Denmark, Netherlands. Oil&gas + loads og wind turbines.
2148 2018-01-06 19:33:40 And if there’s an oil spill, they can spend some of that time separating the dead from the alive ones.
2149 2018-01-06 19:33:39 Coconut oil to help remove them safely and also keep natural lashes lush and healthy! It took a long ass time letting them fall out naturally but my eyelashes are pretty normal and healthy at the moment
2150 2018-01-06 19:33:37 They're on fishing boats, cruise ships and oil rigs.  Also a few on the ISS. Keep up will ya!
2151 2018-01-06 19:33:19 Id like to try to become a trader in the oil and gas field.. any advice would be more than welcome on how to start thanks in advance .. #oott
2152 2018-01-06 19:33:18 I’m panicking! We have gone from a prospective Final Four team & by irrationally (unfairly)firing Rick, rendered them a bubble team (or NIT??) At what point do we take pitchforks & boiling oil to #UofL admin?? They did this to our team!
2153 2018-01-06 19:32:51 Boil pasta  w salt. Drain. Drizzle w ex vir olive oil. sauté ground meat w chopped onions til sizzling. Put it on top of pasta. Add ketchup
2154 2018-01-06 19:32:50 Safflower oil >>>
2155 2018-01-06 19:32:42 True. I had to use a crappy electric wall heaters in Aberdeen...oil capital of Europe, right? So expensive and inefficient. This just reminded me about one of the most surprising things I saw in England...a wooden panelling at the top of tiles in a bathroom with carpet #TrueStory
2156 2018-01-06 19:32:40 There have been more than enough environmental tragedies caused by these careless and poorly regulated oil companies.
2157 2018-01-06 19:32:35 The snake oil salesman Trump and the GOP crooks are in charge of everything
2158 2018-01-06 19:32:31 Mixtapes over albums all day
2159 2018-01-06 19:32:28 You do that by cycling off shampooing every day, very very slowly, over about six months to a year. Shampoo only every other day for about a month, then cut out days here and there; your hair naturally produces much less oil and stays clean and comfortable much longer.
2160 2018-01-06 19:32:22 Just want my doggone oil changed
2161 2018-01-06 19:32:17 How are those oil drilling rigs going to help your fishermen? Oil spills tend to kill the fish and the industry but we know you don't care about people other than yourself. Empty Suit.
2162 2018-01-06 19:32:11 @realDonaldTrump please ask Jeff Sessions to leave CBD oil out of the cannabis ruling. CBD. It help kids with autism people with cancer. Please Mr. President. Parents of kids with autism can only do so much therap y don't deny these kids an alternative treatment. Very low THV
2163 2018-01-06 19:31:48 Sveliamo la location che ospiterà a Capaccio-Paestum, dal 14 al 20 maggio 2018, EVO International Olive Oil Contest
2164 2018-01-06 19:31:46 got mah... dark tannin oil
2165 2018-01-06 19:31:34 Thank you for working against this misguided oil-industry-appeasing plan to drill more holes in the Gulf, in the Arctic, other coastal areas. We can't trust oil companies to protect our land and water, or animals, and human lives.
2166 2018-01-06 19:31:33 Incoherence....nice. Why is someone with a PhD in Chemical Engineering not responding to my suggestions of fixing GOP(Greed Over People)?  Maybe you should try the joint. It will be fun!
2167 2018-01-06 19:31:28 Oil field life still?
2168 2018-01-06 19:31:27 Where does baby oil come from
2169 2018-01-06 19:31:23 More than welcome to try out flawless gold oil Maria it is a healing and Rejuvenating facial elixir not so much an oil base. suitable for all skin types a very popular product.

2170 2018-01-06 19:31:13 There was a bigger issue with invading Iraq knocking out Saddam Hussein; he's the one who invaded Kuwait to steal it as his own Arabian Gulf port & annex it's oil reserves... There was noone to stop him but, the U.S. & we did... The 2nd Gulf War was the problem...
2171 2018-01-06 19:31:08 My car is getting an oil change and washed at the dealership.

2173 2018-01-06 19:30:54 Shout out to team oil money
2174 2018-01-06 19:30:51 This guy is really pictching a fit & cursing the workers out at the oil change place bc he's been here "30 min" & they should change their name from "super quick" to "super slow." old people are so fucking entitled. 30 fucking min. Really?
2175 2018-01-06 19:30:45 In three to six months, it'll start staying like that on its own. Then you need to reduce the oil content of your hair, to make it more stable and relaxed. This is also just really good for you!
2176 2018-01-06 19:30:39 I’ve been using grape seed oil as a cleanser on my face for a good six months, but this weather is awful for keeping it loisturized. I used avocado oil for the first time yesterday and my skin feels wonderful.
2177 2018-01-06 19:30:34 Would do a full service check oil make sure fully lubricated water level so u don’t burst a pipe!! The check ur battery hoping u would need a jump start!!! Brimming Brummell x
2178 2018-01-06 19:30:33 I think Donald Trump and all his friends in the Republican Party forgot what public means it means for all that for the oil companies not for the mineral companies that for the coal companies but for all the people
2179 2018-01-06 19:30:32 1 IN 2! 50% IF THE population gets cancer  from our environment!? Higher than thought. Is THERE an AGENDA  here if GENECIDE!? Is there COLLUSION between the Oil Corps. Who CREATE  Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals  for treatments and remedies  with DOCTORS  who are making BILLIONS !Z
2180 2018-01-06 19:30:29 wash ,deep condition, oil treatment. face mask... eat, nap
2181 2018-01-06 19:30:22 Oil off the cost @North_Ayrshire not going for it because of a nuclear weapon .

2183 2018-01-06 19:29:49 Rex tillerson is combating every international issue by phone and plane. Replaces lacking historical First Lady. He was an oil exec only. Late night multilingual learning and late arrivals tired and turbulence. Hmmm. @CareersWeek
2184 2018-01-06 19:29:45 Have a nice cold glass of brominated vegetable oil (mountain dew)
2185 2018-01-06 19:29:42 Seriously if you have any eczema/psoriasis/ dry skin get jojoba oil. Also it makes your nails super awesome too. <3 @ArcaneRatsel
2186 2018-01-06 19:29:21 Not in my backyard mentality is what’s hurting this country.  Why do you support reduced regulations in the oil industry?  You’re votes widen the gap...but serve you well!
2187 2018-01-06 19:29:05 The price of oil is considerably lower than the price it takes to produce off shore oil.  I don't think there will be a stampede to drill.
2188 2018-01-06 19:28:46 วีคนี้ตายแน่ๆ ร่างกายพังมากๆเหมือนไม่ได้นอนไปวันนึงแล้ววันต่อๆไปคือได้นอนวันละแบบหยุมหยิม
2189 2018-01-06 19:28:24 yup  but really salman is the oil of bollywood 
2190 2018-01-06 19:28:19 Laying in bed warm watching netflix hitting my oil pen while it’s cold outside, my dad brought me an elote 
2191 2018-01-06 19:28:15 @BahiCosmetics got some beard oil. Black owned and good reviews
2192 2018-01-06 19:28:13 I got my oil changed and took the backroads home and some poor pickup was stuck in the snow trying to back out of his driveway so I pulled over with the hazards on and manually pushed him out to the road.
2193 2018-01-06 19:28:07 Just use vegetable oil instead of butter and whatever milk substitute you prefer 
2194 2018-01-06 19:28:05 Woman At This Airport Lounge: What is that you’re drinking?

ME: Bourbon.

WATAL: What’s bourbon?

ME: ... Sunlight through wooden blinds. A husky-voiced cabaret singer. Driftwood and saddle oil. Sunday afternoon. The knowing smirk of Sam Shep-

WATAL: God never MIND
2195 2018-01-06 19:28:02 The tea tree oil toner or spray is really good and not harsh. I have combo skin too, and stuff will dry the shit out of me too, could be worth a shot :)
2196 2018-01-06 19:27:59 It’s not Scotland’s oil then. It’s everyone’s. Keep up with the history and wishes of the peoples of Scotland. It’s not difficult. And they like rule from Edinburgh as much as from London.
2197 2018-01-06 19:27:58 You are a fool. It is safe and economical. It reduces our dependence on oil from countries that hate us. It keeps money in US rather than going overseas. Maybe you can get a donations from big oil rather than greenie weenies. We all know votes go with money.
2198 2018-01-06 19:27:57 @POTUS WE NEED PRES.#TRUMP'S TEAM TO KEEP EYE ON #OIL #PRICES, CONTROL #INFLATION & INTERST RATE INCREASE BY #FED.,NO MORE THAN .25% PER YEAR.
2199 2018-01-06 19:27:52 Agree but let them determine what we have in the ocean. Oil and gas, we can fight later.
2200 2018-01-06 19:27:48 I don't disagree, even if all energy was green we still use it for manufacturing however Canada shouldn't be a pushover with our resources and charge the corps coming in such like Norway and their massive fund from their oil
2201 2018-01-06 19:27:32 Sudofed & olbus oil. Put it in hot water and steam will clear them. You can also put it on hankies & pillows to help sleep.
2202 2018-01-06 19:27:31 The was changed by the snake oil salesman Trump, your fake President
2203 2018-01-06 19:27:21 It's mostly oil paint on (very thick) paper! But I did a fair bit on my computer as well, in Photoshop. Some pages are nearly 100% paint and paper, and some are a mixture. I wonder if they can tell the difference—feel free to send specific questions if they have any.
2204 2018-01-06 19:27:20 @SecretaryZinke Do not open the Gulf Coast to oil drilling! We don't need it; we certainly don't need another oil spill to kill animals, industry, and 11 humans, in case you forgot. Gee, ya think all that sunshine could be put to use??
2205 2018-01-06 19:27:15 What it looks like..today. this guy is worse than a used car salesman.. he's like a snake oil fortuneteller, carrying his own set of tarot cards, selling doom and gloom with the "fix" at discount
2206 2018-01-06 19:27:02 are u eating chips made w avocado oil
2207 2018-01-06 19:27:01 Girl first of all $10 at winners! And it helps with scars and dark spots, overall skin tone/complexion. Lots of vitamins and antioxidants. It's also a dry oil so good for ppl w/ oily skin like me.
2208 2018-01-06 19:26:56 So... just to be clear, the same crowd that supports cannabis oil and bleach enemas is mocking a valid treatment because the name sounds like a dangerous street drug.
2209 2018-01-06 19:26:56 DOUSES MY HEAD IN 100% VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, CYNTHIA AM I DOING THIS RIGHT
2210 2018-01-06 19:26:56 Didn’t know it took so long to comb ur hair and oil down ur six pack for a shirtless selfie @BrunoMars
2211 2018-01-06 19:26:56 Lol after I showered for the night..  Sardine oil poured on my bare body
2212 2018-01-06 19:26:47 Obama was like a used cars salesman always selling us lemons & a Snake oil salesmen. He never acted like a President of The American People!
2213 2018-01-06 19:26:44 You already know I’m coming through with that castor oil & tea tree oil mix for maximum results on them tough bleach burns 
2214 2018-01-06 19:26:42 And almost all inductions lead to “fetal distress”.. and make baby poop inside from being squiuso hard, so both of those really don’t tell me why they won’t use castor oil, but will use pit. Lol
2215 2018-01-06 19:26:38 I need to get an oil change
2216 2018-01-06 19:26:17 $500 for 150 gallons of oil to heat this house is insane
2217 2018-01-06 19:26:07 really?  btw The price of oil is increases and sometimes it decreases but Salman's price is only increasing and will never decrease.. 
2218 2018-01-06 19:26:04 The only form of prep with any evidence to back it up is practice and familiarization with format—which are widely available for free. Paid prep classes are snake oil that get way too much attention in discussions of standardized assessment.
2219 2018-01-06 19:26:02 @Indy11EastEnd apparently we need to find a place to stare into the sun at Lucas Oil Stadium
2220 2018-01-06 19:26:02 I really don’t care how little I poop, I cannot drink this burdock blend oil. YUCK.
2221 2018-01-06 19:25:56 Salmon for one -I find that no other oil does it quite as good. Of course it burns rather quickly and this is what makes it ideal here
2222 2018-01-06 19:25:50 And now we get oil rigs! Thank you @marcorubio for always protecting our president. I’m advocating for at least 2. One off shore from Mar a Lago and the other off the western coast of Miami. #FloridiansLOVEoil #townhalltime
2223 2018-01-06 19:25:49 Essential oil diffusers smell like my ex boyfriend from last year
2224 2018-01-06 19:25:49 my friend came to see me on her work break and I was complaining about how cold I was because my family has no oil heating and can’t afford more and so she went and BOUGHT ME A HEATER FOR MY ROOM SO I WOULDNT BE COLD
2225 2018-01-06 19:25:47 Well she says it’s a treatment oil. It removes black heads on skin, burnt colored skin and nourishes the skin. I honestly don’t know it’s content but I know it works .
2226 2018-01-06 19:25:44 Cool oil
2227 2018-01-06 19:25:37 Healthy competition, yes of course. Conflict for the sake of selling drugs, oil and guns etc.. with no compensation for very basic damages caused, no! We don't have to have common dreams,just common respect for maintaining positive opportunity in the vast abundance of 1st world!
2228 2018-01-06 19:25:25 That's why Jesus's 2nd coming can never happen, because if it does, religion's business of selling snake oil to the credulous would be over.
2229 2018-01-06 19:25:15 It’s a laxative so, yeah. That’s how it brings on labor, by irritating the bowel. Get hydrated before hand. The meconium thing is not legit. Most women are post dates when they use castor oil, so nobody is for sure if it’s because of them being late, or from the oil.
2230 2018-01-06 19:25:14 “Strong rum and ah cup of tea”- Lavaman 
 why I could see all man in Jouvert with a cup of of old oil in it 
2231 2018-01-06 19:25:14 I worked 37 years in the offshore oil drilling industry and live on the Gulf coast of Mexico   And catch every fish I can off a boat the uses lots of leaded fuel ! Ya only live once !
2232 2018-01-06 19:25:13 The snake oil salesman Trump supports don't care because the are brown type people and of Latin heritage. Trump said are not good people, like Neo-nazi's remember the GOP don't want your help
2233 2018-01-06 19:25:04 Don't forget to massage castor oil on his edges !!!
2234 2018-01-06 19:25:03 Beverly Hills High School receives around $300,000 per year from a cluster of oil wells on campus.
2235 2018-01-06 19:24:59 Sure. Helps ALOT with the itching. I'm covered in enough red oil to cook Jollof for 30 people
2236 2018-01-06 19:24:52 She also wasted the £90bn windfall from N Sea oil/used it to make miners/uk manufacturing redundant
2237 2018-01-06 19:24:51 Getting my car oil changed.
2238 2018-01-06 19:24:31 Saudi Arabia has put Billions in to Mosques in the UNITED States. I think we need to tell them we need reciprocity! And stop colluding to keep our Oil and Gas Prices High. It’s time we hold them accountable for being the leader of the Oil Cartel! US Companies would be Fined!
2239 2018-01-06 19:24:25 AFAICT this is his response to everything. A friend posted that a particular kind of olive-oil based soap originated in the Arab world and he has accused her—repeatedly—of claiming that Arabs invented olives and olive oil & sent his minions to troll her.
2240 2018-01-06 19:24:23 this dude tried to tell me mcdonald's fries r haram cuz they make em in the same oil as the pork and i was like bud i worked @ mcd's when i was 15 and i made the fries u just want mcdonald's fries to be haram for god knows what reason
2241 2018-01-06 19:24:22 Yeah, conditioner will lock the moisture and coconut oil too. Result will be perfectly balanced hair.
2242 2018-01-06 19:24:20 Use vitamin E oil on them!
2243 2018-01-06 19:24:18 Slightly tmi but ya extra virgin olive oil girl here is late and i made a “gosh i hope I’m not pregnant” joke 
2244 2018-01-06 19:23:57 The glutted oil companies and Bizarre greedy nationalist Secretary of the Interior thank you.  Stuff your money in your coffins as fast as you can and reap the whirlwind.
2245 2018-01-06 19:23:54 What does Rosehip oil do? I saw it on the Sephora website but it was sold out 
2246 2018-01-06 19:23:49 Snake oil salesmen

2248 2018-01-06 19:23:41 Coconut oil na adi agbon na...@xxheun_L
2249 2018-01-06 19:23:24 Maintaining a functional economy is key, reliance on one commodity is not sensible. Where in the UK economy even resembles the dominance within the economy that oil has in Venezuela? Oil accounted for more than 50% of Venezuela's GDP and 90%+ of exports.
2250 2018-01-06 19:23:23 £5.50 for a pint of Neck Oil.
2251 2018-01-06 19:23:09 But it's got olive oil on it 
2252 2018-01-06 19:22:59 Red oil,
2253 2018-01-06 19:22:58 I mean, what's absurd is that half of all these rich fucks would never had been able to get a job if they didn't all have rich daddies giving them a cushy job at their oil company/arms manufacturer/pharmaceutical co/etc
2254 2018-01-06 19:22:55 @FieryLilyLove I loved your Argon oil recommendation so much I was curious if you had any recommendations for redness?
2255 2018-01-06 19:22:47 Her first book was a bit wild and she’s def heavy on the coconut oil/maple syrup but also some of her recipes are great (her sweet potato quesadillas for eg)
2256 2018-01-06 19:22:47 If I'm off any oil and it's earlier than 12am cancel ya plans
2257 2018-01-06 19:22:31 Tau will oil wash out ?

2260 2018-01-06 19:22:16 today, oil is trading below $80 a barrel and is also organizing the last one I got pound. Buzz. Buzz. But I, entelechy, form of one. 5/5
2261 2018-01-06 19:22:06 ليس الايقاف بشكل عام هو المشكلة و انما انخفاض الطلب بمرور الزمن مع زيادة العرض كما هو متوقع وصول "Oil Demand Peak" مما قد يدفع الى "Race to the bottom" من ناحية المصدرين
2262 2018-01-06 19:22:00 Unhealthiest are Margarine, Shortening, Corn Oil, Cottonseed Oil, Soybean Oil because of TRANS FAT!
2263 2018-01-06 19:21:57 Oil
2264 2018-01-06 19:21:57 True. I feel sorry for the folks that believed in him! Hes nothing but a con man, a snake oil salesman.
2265 2018-01-06 19:21:52 @realDonaldTrump dear sir, a cannabis derivative, CBD oil, cured my inoperable stage 4 brain cancer.! when u try to enforce antiquated laws, that were written by long since dead corporate tools, u show us how far out of touch u r, and that u have no concern for REAL medicine..SAD

2278 2018-01-06 19:19:58 Coconut oil has helped me in the past with dry hands
2279 2018-01-06 19:19:50 Two slices of pizza are the equivalent to swallowing 3 spoons of warm oil. Do you feel like eating pizza now?
2280 2018-01-06 19:19:48 I really love the rough chibi style, it's beautiful! Reminds me of oil paintings and old game boy stuff and Zelda. I like it a lot!
2281 2018-01-06 19:19:34 Pedigree 1nc a day. Milk and rice. Roti without oil and dnt feed them anytime or from ur food plate. No oil. Have perfect time lines
2282 2018-01-06 19:19:30 Now stand up and restore the Obama era freeze on offshore oil exploration or your work means zero. Catching polluted Red Snapper is as useful as giving @realDonaldTrump a book for Christmas.
2283 2018-01-06 19:19:25 Re Iran's claims that Erbil is the mastermind of the recent Iran protests, were the KRG this formidable then Iran might be better off not meddling with Kurdistan and stealing Kirkuk oil like it does in Basra via its militia mafia friends over there.
2284 2018-01-06 19:19:17 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
2285 2018-01-06 19:19:14 oil? how and why? plz explain 
2286 2018-01-06 19:19:01 The three gifts had a spiritual meaning: gold as a symbol of kingship on earth, frankincense (an incense) as a symbol of deity, and myrrh (an embalming oil) as a symbol of death.  "gold, as to a king; myrrh, as to one who was mortal; and incense, as to a God."
2287 2018-01-06 19:18:51 Only if you are representing Big Oil and Gas wealthy Conservatives.
2288 2018-01-06 19:18:42 Lemme go get fe oil changed before she cusss me out by tweakin
2289 2018-01-06 19:18:34 2 options - cut in half lengthways, simmer gently in stock  (with saffron) until just tender.
Drain, oil & then chargrill the tits off them.

Or roast the buggery out of them under an old bird with plenty of garlic.

Relax & open a window...
2290 2018-01-06 19:18:14 With his huge energy sucking mansions and private jets.  Still invested in oil companies Al?
2291 2018-01-06 19:17:48 Coconut oil is now 8k
2292 2018-01-06 19:17:39 I need some oil for my hair asap.
2293 2018-01-06 19:17:33 Oil was selling at less than $30/b and below the quota allocated to Nigeria. You should ask yourself why your govt couldn't repair the ones we have.
2294 2018-01-06 19:17:31 Lush has a new bath oil line that just came out.

I guess what I’m saying is that mistakes were make this lunchhour.
2295 2018-01-06 19:17:29 You’re elitist who already have your money. Similar to Ted Kennedy who wanted windmills but complained when they ruined his million dollar view of the ocean. Ironic that the Bushes made money in oil especially when it was real dirty. Are you paying any back for past sins? #MAGA
2296 2018-01-06 19:17:24 oh yeah lots of people like castor oil put it's too thick to use it directly on my hair I would have to mix it with others
2297 2018-01-06 19:17:11 salman = oil

2300 2018-01-06 19:17:00 Oil goes down.
It is a time of a new war.
2301 2018-01-06 19:16:59 It sounds wonderfully mysterious and alchemical. "Unto the oil of chimera, and wyvern's blood, add two drops of tincture of topinambur."
2302 2018-01-06 19:16:56 All they need to do is change my oil & not worry about nothin else

2308 2018-01-06 19:16:30 If anyone sees me in person I promise you my hair isn’t greasy. I have macadamia oil in it
2309 2018-01-06 19:16:23 Prepare that Fetzer valve with some 3-in-1 oil and some gauze pads. And I'm gonna need 'bout ten quarts of anti-freeze,
2310 2018-01-06 19:16:15 Finally decided to get my oil changed & my gas light wanna pop on 
2311 2018-01-06 19:16:14 When your being bought by oil companies you forget the past. No other reason.
2312 2018-01-06 19:16:10 The problem regarding Trump's mental illness is that it's accepted by the Republicans that could remove him. The Christian Right, Big Pharma and the Oil industry own this country and unless WE vote these 's out we will lose our precious democracy.
2313 2018-01-06 19:16:01 i went to get w oil change, & i’m wearing a navy hoodie, the dude goes oh you went to the navy, I said no does it look like I did, he said yeah you look mean

2316 2018-01-06 19:15:49 The KING is Coming!!!  let us prepare ourselves with oil in our lamps (The Spirit), will you be ready when Jesus comes or knocking at the Door saying Jesus let me in (Heaven) to hear him say depart from me I never (knew) you 
Amen;
2317 2018-01-06 19:15:44 Doin shit you know gone hurt in the morning  RT @ThatDamnTwerk1: Jumpin off the fuckin dresser on that oil
2318 2018-01-06 19:15:38 It’s frustrating, to say the least, that pump prices continue to track oil price increases yet lag when it decreases. Can’t blame any government for the speed of price movements, it’s down to the oil companies
2319 2018-01-06 19:15:31 Tr*mp can drill for oil... ON MY HEAD. In my head? On my scalp! Point is, leave the land alone and never use conditioner.
2320 2018-01-06 19:15:31 Simple oil of cloves...
2321 2018-01-06 19:15:28 because salman saved YRF and bollywood this year , and oil is so expensive and rare it has an effect in markets as salman
2322 2018-01-06 19:15:22 By the way, the most profitable money in fracking lies in oil and high-ethane content natural gas. It's an ugly way to make money in the 21st century, and a stupid one in the Bowland Shale, where the ethane content is below 5% @INEOS_Shale @INEOS @kevinhollinrake @F_F_Ryedale
2323 2018-01-06 19:15:21 “On Jan. 2, oil, used primarily as a back-up fuel, generated 1/3 of the region’s electricity while cleaner-burning natural gas, normally accounting for about half the region’s generation, was cut in half because of inadequate fuel supply. Solar and wind were providing just 2%.”
2324 2018-01-06 19:15:19 *he puts a bit of olive oil in the frying pan, and starts slicing vegetables, turns on the pan, then starts sauteeing them... He breaks up the ground sausage into the pan when that's done, letting it all cook down, and the onions and garlic flavor the sausage and mushrooms.*
2325 2018-01-06 19:15:15 This is precisely why I use it for certain dishes. Plus I don’t know why palm oil is bad so the comparison is lost on me.
2326 2018-01-06 19:15:11 @ Chelsea Market & guy at beard oil booth stops me:

Hey man you know what you need!?”

Not this, i don’t have a beard

Well don’t you want your, you know like when you’re with a girl, your skin all smooth?

No. I’m gay

Agh! Almost had you there

Yeah, well you had a 50/50 there
2327 2018-01-06 19:15:08 each sale comes with complimentary oil spill?
2328 2018-01-06 19:15:08 You'll be the city's fault :D. My hair is enjoying some coconut oil treatment… Time to get some love too :D.
2329 2018-01-06 19:15:07 you know you're fucking with a real Mexican when he tastes like beer and smells like oil 
2330 2018-01-06 19:14:56 Ye of deviant mind, that curls around like garma garam jalebis of sunflower oil fame; only ye can come out with such ingenious feats!
All hail the Parantha warriors!
2331 2018-01-06 19:14:43 Still have to buy castor oil , & a coloring book..
2332 2018-01-06 19:14:41 Why are you discontinuing dilo oil? 
2333 2018-01-06 19:14:39 145M people in Russia do not survive on narcotics sales, contract killings and prostitution. They have a real economy and are among the largest oil and gas exporters in the world. Mueller won’t be able to prove the criminal source of funds.
2334 2018-01-06 19:14:36 I need an oil change and my car detailed
2335 2018-01-06 19:14:36 Increasing PV and wind power sources increases GHG emissions.
Actually, the only ways to decrease GHG emissions per MWh are, by efficiency 
- Opening a new nuclear plant,
- switching from coal to oil or from oil to gas,
- replacing old coal, oil or gas plants by new ones.
2336 2018-01-06 19:14:34 #Trump wants to allow oil drilling along the coast. Say good-bye to the billions of dollar tourism industry & tens of thousands of jobs. Beachfront homeowners, who objected to windfarms that had some aesthetic value, will now look at filthy oil rigs. Home prices will fall
2337 2018-01-06 19:14:33 fuck. forgot to get argan oil today.

2340 2018-01-06 19:14:18 Likely but depends on what factor pushes economic activity weaker ie higher rates, oil inflation, or geopolitical actions to name a few possibilities
2341 2018-01-06 19:14:14 #CampDavid Totally agree we shouldn't give a cent to Palestinians or Pakistan. But that pales in comparison to the $$ we send to Arab oil producers who hate our guts. Drill baby drill, then drill some more. We shouldn't buy one drop from the M.E., Venezuela or other haters.
2342 2018-01-06 19:14:09 Offshore rigs off coastal communities will destroy their tourism industry, not everyone can work on an oil rig.  This would destroy the livelihoods of countless cities and towns on the coasts.
2343 2018-01-06 19:14:08 I’ve been sleeping on coconut oil . I def need to bring some back to school with me
2344 2018-01-06 19:14:06 Oil seeps from the ocean floor continuously! Nature has a way of dealing with natural products on its own! Why do you continually want to invest in ARAB Oil? We are a self sufficient Nation!

2348 2018-01-06 19:13:21 Thanks Senator. What about the Interior Dept. plan to open up our coastal Atlantic waters for oil exploration. Will you take a public stand on this now? We want to know where you say you stand.
2349 2018-01-06 19:13:17 Hello, opening offshore drilling, gutting regulations and getting rid of the tax for oil spill cleanup ring a bell? You guys are really bad at this. 2018 is gonna be bad for you.
2350 2018-01-06 19:13:16 Hayike try I castor oil..
2351 2018-01-06 19:13:11 Friends of Science would have said this couldn't be done. Friends of Science tell us "No climate change," one breath and the next "Climate change is real but to late to do anything but speed towards it." Friends of Science is deep in coal and oil pockets period.
2352 2018-01-06 19:13:11 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for probiotic vodka, and put some sex essential oil in my diffuser.

2358 2018-01-06 19:12:57 Per il brufolo domani corri in erboristeria a comprare il tea tree oil!! E' una mano santa!
2359 2018-01-06 19:12:56 Given how Lazar/G.Reinhart/Brossoit’s seasons have gone, kind of wild that the Oil Kings teams that made 3 straight dub finals (and won a memorial cup) have produced 1 regular NHLer (pysyk, maybe jarry)
2360 2018-01-06 19:12:55 I'm from NJ, where people still can't pump their own gas bc we're flammable--which enabled me to get a job pumping gas the summer of 1988. I actually made $5-10 a day in tips for checking oil and cleaning windows, plus I got to read all day between pumps.
2361 2018-01-06 19:12:37 if you can make badass pico de gallo, hummus, asian chicken salad and avocado chocolate mousse not sure what else out there can cure all your illnesses besides cayenne pepper lemonade w/ maple syrup. throw in some parmesan popcorn w/ olive oil too.
2362 2018-01-06 19:12:12 Too many Oil and Big Energy lobbyists/bribes to get that through #CORRUPTION
2363 2018-01-06 19:12:01 Just walked in my room to my dog licking coconut oil out of the jar 
2364 2018-01-06 19:11:56 Ciabattas with olive oil and Italian spices mixed in.
2365 2018-01-06 19:11:47 I found this quote on a post-it in a notebook and can't figure out where it's from. Do y'all recognize it?
"To be the rock the oil tanker dashes up against 
To also be the birds covered in oil"
2366 2018-01-06 19:11:43 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2367 2018-01-06 19:11:43 The beard oil is amazing, too. Buying the sample pack for my boyfriend was the best gift to myself I ever gave someone else.
2368 2018-01-06 19:11:35 Tulog na gagawin ko pa pala mio ko mamaya tanggal ang oil cap 
2369 2018-01-06 19:11:35 My new beard oil smells so good
2370 2018-01-06 19:11:20 Jumpin off the fuckin dresser on that oil
2371 2018-01-06 19:11:16 I think our best hope lies in somehow taking over an oil rig by force and declaring ourselves a sovereign nation. And begging for EU membership.
2372 2018-01-06 19:11:12 That's utter shit. It matters 100%. Some chips shops wrap in paper. Some use those fucking stupid card boxes. Some use veg oil some use dripping, some charge for scraps, some don't. That's just the start... Jesus...
2373 2018-01-06 19:11:08 Oh! Plus... we need to get as many out of the water as we can before you put a bunch of oil rigs in there...
2374 2018-01-06 19:11:01 Meatloaf, for sandwiches with mashed potatoes. Grilled on bread in a garlicky oil. Mmmmmmmm
2375 2018-01-06 19:10:57 Because there is nothing better than sautéing onion, garlic, and olive oil. It literally makes anything better.
2376 2018-01-06 19:10:57 coconut oil fixes everything. acne? coconut oil! dry skin? coconut oil! broken heart? coconut oil!!!!
2377 2018-01-06 19:10:52 Once the palm oil is heated up,add the pepper, and allow it to fry for some minutes 6mins.
2378 2018-01-06 19:10:48 It’s been fucked from the late 90s and got worse with the tv deals getting bigger each year as well Arab  oil tycoons getting involved
2379 2018-01-06 19:10:45 "Ok... so what do you like in your sauce? Mushrooms, onion, garlic, italian sausage?" *he fills a large pot, puts in a few drops of olive oil, and turns it on high, then sets a frying pan on the next burner.*
2380 2018-01-06 19:10:44 Getting an oil diffuser was the best thing I’ve ever done
2381 2018-01-06 19:10:43 I refuse to sit here till 3:00 for an oil change!! I got here at 12:30  what are they doing
2382 2018-01-06 19:10:41 My bottle of vitamin e oil always ends up on the floor. Ghosts? Demons?
2383 2018-01-06 19:10:39 Liberals and democrats are racist as hell, love imperialist wars for oil and pharma, love the surveillance state and militarized police, love record income inequality, then talk down to those who want to change these things. J' DETEST
2384 2018-01-06 19:10:37 Of course. Water would cause me to rust, nor does it do anything sbout the oil and grease I might be soiled with.
2385 2018-01-06 19:10:36 I don't care for falafels but I dig gyros & humus & pita with lots of stuff around it, red and orange and green peppers, olives, olive oil and paprika. Also deli sandwiches and pastries.
2386 2018-01-06 19:10:35 あいて…ちょっとエルザにスリーサイズ聞いただけなのに殴られた…
2387 2018-01-06 19:10:35 YOO IM MAD AF THIS OIL EVAPORATED OVERNIGHT
2388 2018-01-06 19:10:29 Also in favor of privatized #charterschools & his brother is a big time snake oil salesman of for-profit charters.
2389 2018-01-06 19:10:26 It’s safe to apply on skin, but they must be diluted. Since oils are extremely concentrated, they can enter the blood stream and cause irritation. You can dilute by mixing with coconut oil with it :-) I would say in a 3-5% solution.
2390 2018-01-06 19:10:25 Annoying as hell. Ima learn to change my own oil because wtf.
2391 2018-01-06 19:10:19 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
2392 2018-01-06 19:10:12 So True Kate. All the" Generations-Respected unwritten Norms & protocol" MUST BE CODED. 
If Not, a future Snake Oil POTUS could continue to abuse And further WEAKEN our America.
2393 2018-01-06 19:10:08 Bruh the longest part about this oil change will be buddy inputting the information and taking my keys.
2394 2018-01-06 19:10:04 Trumps' actual genius lies in his ability to dupe and intimidate 30 percent of the population into a cult following.  He is the supreme snake oil salesman. #stablegenius
2395 2018-01-06 19:09:58 But before you heat up the oil,make sure u have finished chopping the vegetables
2396 2018-01-06 19:09:52 Oil ahre
2397 2018-01-06 19:09:51 Which part of “I’m not saying the trade is right”, didn’t you understand? I’m saying Corbyn is a hypocrite. As PM (perish the thought), he would never refuse the ‘free’ Saudi oil.
2398 2018-01-06 19:09:38 I need some coconut oil
2399 2018-01-06 19:09:23 Your such a crook and you quote that idiot Mann as supporting your position. History will not look kindly on you. You will in the same sentence as the snake oil salesman of the 1800s
2400 2018-01-06 19:09:19 I have a hunch Bitcoiners perpetuated the plethora of snake oil scams by calling out reputable projects (such as Eth) as scams. People have become desensitized to the notion of blockchain scams.
2401 2018-01-06 19:09:17 Oil Can was a nickname.. Real name Dennis
2402 2018-01-06 19:09:15 Boiling oil
2403 2018-01-06 19:09:13 Oil down, friend.
2404 2018-01-06 19:09:03 I brought my car to the shop and these niggas got Olive Garden catered I’m eating dumb good while getting a oil change ctfu
2405 2018-01-06 19:08:57 Maybe you should ask Trump how that offshore oil drilling (spilling) is going to affect fishing off the coast.
2406 2018-01-06 19:08:46 Boars Head turkey, american cheese, lettuce, tomato, oil/vinegar, black pepper on a soft hoagie or roll. 
2407 2018-01-06 19:08:38 Vitamin E oil
2408 2018-01-06 19:08:33 Nature Made Burpless Fish Oil.  Tried to just copy/paste the link and Twitter has been giving me attitude about links since last night.
2409 2018-01-06 19:08:32 They're a real treat, Ashley! Which new Luxury Bath Oil is catching your eye? 
2410 2018-01-06 19:08:31 Did you vote to eliminate the 9 cent per barrel tax that is supposed to cover oil spills?  Nice little gift to the drillers on Jan 1.
2411 2018-01-06 19:08:30 I’ve been sticking to olive oil for the most part. I feel like that’s key for recreating the flavors I miss: good oils
2412 2018-01-06 19:08:02 Pour the palm oil into a pot and heat for few minutes
2413 2018-01-06 19:07:58 moisturizing has been the biggest thing for me—a lot of my picking starts from an itchy face, so redirecting that impulse to putting a thing on (argan oil/nivea soft/whatever, cetaphil doesn't sting for me but does leave my skin feeling weird) has helped a lot.
2414 2018-01-06 19:07:42 Drink Caster oil. 
2415 2018-01-06 19:07:38 I put some coconut oil spray in it this morning after I showered...i’m about to spray my hairbrush with static guard and brush through it, that works too. i picked the wrong time to cut my hair 
2416 2018-01-06 19:07:37 I hope those fishermen don't mind all the oil pollution you are bringing to Florida's waters. Our White Sand beaches thank you
2417 2018-01-06 19:07:20 Coconut oil or Nivea after-shower lotion

2420 2018-01-06 19:06:51 I just came for an oil change and I'm here getting knowledge  from this lady. It's cool
2421 2018-01-06 19:06:49 If there was no oil, then no cars, no cars, no car accident to cross your path. BP has panache for destroying the planet...
2422 2018-01-06 19:06:45 Can't wait to see how Rubio protect the FL coasts from oil drilling, and eventual oil spilling
2423 2018-01-06 19:06:40 Beard oil, yes bro, fresh batch!
2424 2018-01-06 19:06:31 One second i'm gonna strike oil 
2425 2018-01-06 19:06:31 - sore throat? Mix oregano oil, peppermint oil, tea tree oil, and elderberry oil. Should ease that up in 2 days tops.
2426 2018-01-06 19:06:27 just drown ur face in coconut oil it works every time
2427 2018-01-06 19:06:24 Damn right...no wonder your have 45M notifications... cause oil the your head
2428 2018-01-06 19:06:03 @kaptainsunshine Absolutely love your mission.

Renewable energy is not only absolutely necessary to save the Planet, but also cheaper & make long term economic sense.

There is no realistic argument at all, not to go from our misuse of oil & gas, straight to full renewable asap.
2429 2018-01-06 19:05:22 Good! I want our coastlines protected for my child and my future grandchildren! NC's Outer Banks are precious. We don't need them destroyed by rapacious oil companies.
2430 2018-01-06 19:05:16 I don't like swimming in motor oil and piss dessi
2431 2018-01-06 19:05:12 Really? How will she persuade the climate change deniers and those heavily invested in the petrochemical, oil and gas industry? She's bullied by the Brexit lot already.
2432 2018-01-06 19:05:03 Do you have any smoothing hair oil? Anything similar
2433 2018-01-06 19:05:03 "im gonna have sex with 600 women"
2434 2018-01-06 19:04:58 But that would make us like...Norway.

There, oil companies pay.
2435 2018-01-06 19:04:57 Shout out to @FiveGuysUK in Oxford! Friendly, efficient staff, & the burgers are always great - no overuse of oil in this branch!
2436 2018-01-06 19:04:56 So I have combo (more so oily in the t zone and dry in the other areas) and it legit melts make up off, breaks down oil in your skin, and doesn’t feel drying at all. And I use the priming moisturizer after!
2437 2018-01-06 19:04:56 I need a deep conditioning and hot oil treatment
2438 2018-01-06 19:04:51 @EtihadAirways see the oil of Arabia is not yours private property, it's worlds working class property to be shared jointly.
2439 2018-01-06 19:04:40 I use sweet almond oil and then spray rose water with glycerin. Is the rose water glycerin a hydrator?
2440 2018-01-06 19:04:36 Maybe if they hit oil anywhere on the east coast they will charge California double, for things like transportation, drilling, ETC..
2441 2018-01-06 19:04:35 when it comes to Brussel sprouts is how you cook them that matters you eat them baked instead of boiled they taste way better with olive oil and pepper
2442 2018-01-06 19:04:33 damn why did nobody hype the frankincense essential oil @ me I've been over here playing it safe with my lavender and my peppermint paying franki no mind smdh it's delightful
2443 2018-01-06 19:04:26 They say that when people still rode on vehicles powered by oil, they could go anywhere they wanted. ― Yoshiyuki Sadamoto
2444 2018-01-06 19:04:26 I put my Viatmin E oil after my moisturizing cream
2445 2018-01-06 19:04:25 Man never been on a huge line for oil change before but so close to being next
2446 2018-01-06 19:04:20 I wouldn't have thought of that! I always have Lavender oil. Very into complementary medecines and herbals.
2447 2018-01-06 19:04:16 I say residents of Florida should get paid a portion of revenue from oil. Also, there should be a fund established for very unlikely spills. The @TB_Times took close to a million dollars from BP in the spill in the Gulf of Mexico. It probably saved their failing paper.
2448 2018-01-06 19:04:15 Everyone asks why I don't move closer you work. I have a community here. My old couple at the gas station, my young folks at the grocery store, my guys at the oil/tire spot, my nail lady, my bartender. Can't just replace them.
2449 2018-01-06 19:04:04 Just brought Lexy to get an oil change, full detail & now she got a full tank of gas..  now time to park her so I can go to sleep lol
2450 2018-01-06 19:03:53 何か寒いと思ったら、掛け布団掛けずに下パン一で寝て凍死寸前だったわ。掛け布団外したらアホとか死ねとか警告する装置ないかなww

2457 2018-01-06 19:03:06 Have you ever tried Cannabis CBD oil products?
2458 2018-01-06 19:02:50 A few squirts of baby oil in my bath ensures that I don't need to moisturize at night. I'm tired and I'm lazy...
2459 2018-01-06 19:02:22 Need a fucking holiday ... a cocktail in one hand baby oil in the other!
2460 2018-01-06 19:02:19 THAT OIL IS GOIN TO YOUR BRAINS
2461 2018-01-06 19:02:05 Virgil and a top keeper we would’ve done well out of that 142m. We are not an oil rich club. It’s about replacing players with quality. So far Klopp has done that
2462 2018-01-06 19:02:05 Disgusting. Were the people on the coasts clamoring for more pollution, destruction of their natural resources and Oil derricks on their horizons? #Criminal #NeverEverTrustaRepublican
2463 2018-01-06 19:02:02 Btw learn to change your own oil. It's incredibly easy and much cheaper if you do it yourself
2464 2018-01-06 19:02:01 im getting my oil changed and i have to wait so i bought so much food
2465 2018-01-06 19:01:48 Thanks Phil, the old oil powered ones seem to work ok...
2466 2018-01-06 19:01:39 One word. OIL. But first you will need to get it out of the ground & sold via some pipe dream to coastal port
2467 2018-01-06 19:01:34 tea tree oil? my lord n savior???
2468 2018-01-06 19:01:28 Can you work to pass a state law against drilling for oil off the coast of California?  Public support is there to get it on the ballot.  Figure out a strategy that will work.  In other words, give people a solution.
2469 2018-01-06 19:01:27 Did not want much for dinner. 
Got an ''Alheira'' (Bird meat, Olive Oil, Bread, Garlic and Lard), heated up and now this is dinner.

2472 2018-01-06 19:01:24 I don't believe in endorsing the palm oil industy because of the fact that one day of burning releases more pollution than the whole of the US in one year. For this reason, know some chocolates might taste good, but at the cost they have to the breathing of others, don't endorse.
2473 2018-01-06 19:01:14 Good point.
Big oil co.s like @exxonmobil and @Chevron may have done more to cause #GlobalWarming than anyone else.
2474 2018-01-06 19:01:12 Son, how you never change the oil in your car and be shocked when ya motor lock up
2475 2018-01-06 19:01:04 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
2476 2018-01-06 19:00:58 I got a full tank, oil change and my truck is clean and detailed, feels like I got a brand new truck
2477 2018-01-06 19:00:53 How ownership affects the oil based/local based question ? Transportation by wind/sea/solar or even nuclear has tremendous effect and not only on air quality.
2478 2018-01-06 19:00:53 Depends on the mustard, one with a high oil content may, the oil would separate and could be rancid. I'd say that would be years in the happening though ..... How old is the mustard?
2479 2018-01-06 19:00:45 Wouldn't hold my breath, politics and love is like oil and vinegar.

2483 2018-01-06 19:00:22 My brother’s friends hit a coyote on a rural road in ND. Figuring they could sell it for fur, threw it in the back seat. Later heard panting as it sat up.  They quickly pulled over & let the coyote out.
2484 2018-01-06 19:00:13 I use the "burpless" fish oil.  No fishy taste, no burpy
2485 2018-01-06 19:00:12 Oil price peaks are part of the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. 
They lead to peaks in fracking but also ratchet up EVs, renewables and storage, so the next price dip (for both oil and gas) will be lower. The long term price trend is down.
2486 2018-01-06 19:00:03 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2487 2018-01-06 18:59:51 I decided to try lard instead of vegetable oil to make my roux and now my house smells like chitlins 
2488 2018-01-06 18:59:51 So with this reversal don't expect to see oil companies parking drilling rigs left and right offshore California. Just won't happen.
2489 2018-01-06 18:59:32 Feel like going to the neighbors' to beg a cup of heating oil (we seem to have run out, on this the coldest day of the year)
2490 2018-01-06 18:59:16 @narendramodi @PiyushGoyal which is bigger evil Oil from middle east or cheap solar panels from China? I think its former, as we can always build our own solar panels not dig oilwells. Please make India Energy independent!
2491 2018-01-06 18:59:06 They are attempting to use it as a bridge . . . Like the cash of modern financial space. While it slowly soaks up value over the 5 years of escrow, their first play is to dominate the financial industry, using XRP as a liquidity asset (like the oil of their machine).
2492 2018-01-06 18:59:05 The series of emergency meeting held in the North during the IPOB era shows that they are more concerned with anything that stops the flow of oil money up North. As for the herdsmen killings, human lives don't matter
2493 2018-01-06 18:59:02 Well true. But if you fly from anywhere that isnt Oslo, Bergen or Bodø you will most likely have to connect there because its part of the "oil route".
2494 2018-01-06 18:58:58 Oil companies have operational constraints and a limited number of drilling rigs. They can't just drill everywhere and at the same time production is based on demand, futures, and oil prices.
2495 2018-01-06 18:58:53 Snake oil salesman Don't disappear, They Just Dilute Oil Sold w/a Sprinkle of Truth & call it something else. He'll Dart throw at anything To Support His Lifestyle & remain "relevant."
2496 2018-01-06 18:58:35 Came my oil change spot and was greeted by a new dude. Old head stepped in and said "Give her all our discounts, son. She spends a lot of money here!"  That's the kinda service I come here for!
2497 2018-01-06 18:58:34 I always end with an 8 banana smoothie with loads of seeds, walnuts, Brazil nuts, chia and frozen berries. Loads of protein. Then a small bowl rice with coconut oil & turmeric to reset glycogen levels
2498 2018-01-06 18:58:30 To bounce back as a good media outlet, get a list of Fulani herdsmen & their sponsors, a report of FG dealings with oil marketers that proves the truth in this current fuel crisis & lastly how much it cost to treat a Nigerian official abroad
2499 2018-01-06 18:58:26 For all the flak city get from he elite historic clubs on spending, May I remind ya'll that city's record signing is 55 million which is KDB. City have never spent over that on one single player yet we get criticised. Let me guess is it cause we have oil money?
2500 2018-01-06 18:58:02 At morning:

At night, face wash then Rose hip oil on face, and mint oil and vaseline on lips

2502 2018-01-06 18:57:58 Yes! I’m a naturopath. So I do echinacea, diffuse tea tree oil, ginger shot, elderberry tincture, cold/flu tincture, and throat coat all at the same time. Lastly SLEEP!!!
2503 2018-01-06 18:57:49 Genius-No. Snake oil salesman -Yes
2504 2018-01-06 18:57:48 Justice. But an eye for an eye . . . Guess we'll all be blind. We fund the Nigerian budget from oil destroying the health(livelihood and future generation) of the some others. They do not fight us (Witnessed while with them) but the system that allows it persists. Life is sacred
2505 2018-01-06 18:57:47 Lavender oil on the feet? Am awake myself at some ungodly hour after only 4 hours sleep 
2506 2018-01-06 18:57:47 THE FIRST THING IN MEXICO'S GDP IS OIL. THE SECOND THING IS MONEY SENT BACK TO MEXICO FROM USA!

2507 2018-01-06 18:57:43 No oil/chemicals after Soviet collapse, Cuba turned vacant urban lots into farms. 41% of Havana is now organic agriculture! #WorldChanging
2508 2018-01-06 18:57:38 I bought salted peanuts the other day. They made me sick. I just looked at the container for the ingredients, it contains soya, soya oil or wheat #WTF It’s salted peanuts 
2509 2018-01-06 18:57:08 A more immediate & simpler way to deal with him would be to send him permanently on one of those oil platforms he seems to love so much.
2510 2018-01-06 18:57:08 make it clear to everyone,, if you oppose #Nuclear you are as puppet for #Oil-Industry & #Coal
2511 2018-01-06 18:57:05 Fuck waiting for a oil change man
2512 2018-01-06 18:56:59 Of course. Also true for patients with CF and other malabsorption issues. For most individuals though, not necessary. To say doctors recommend vitamins and fish oil to boost immunity during cold/flu season is generally false.
2513 2018-01-06 18:56:55 Whats your removal routine? I use oil then another soap but still these pigments hang on!!!
2514 2018-01-06 18:56:54 - depression from lack of money (bc car parts)

- less money (bc car parts)

- more car parts (but less money)

- extra supply of oil pans (typs vw)

- I got shit to pay off still

- aight, yeah got that

Things are looking up, lol.
2515 2018-01-06 18:56:47 It's even worse. The Administration has proposed to weaken safety regulations and a hidden provision of the tax bill killed the tax on oil companies used to fund oil spill response efforts.
2516 2018-01-06 18:56:47 The USA needs to mind it's own business. Regime change for OIL and Resources is not what Americans want. If you can't be honest about why you are somewhere in the first place you shouldn't be there.
2517 2018-01-06 18:56:42 Probably because there's no fuckin oil there, genius
2518 2018-01-06 18:56:39 #Climate We have an oil glut and prices so low that ND oil wells are shutting down. But hey, must mean that it's time to open up offshore drilling and moving into the ANWR.
2519 2018-01-06 18:56:38 The NDP hate Alberta oil now Alberta beef? If they hate this province so much why don’t they just LEAVE and never come back
2520 2018-01-06 18:55:39 Bar the oil clubs teams can't write off losses like city can hence the easy turnaround also Pep spent the most while already having a world class attack
2521 2018-01-06 18:55:21 Yeah-- but I'm still stuck with the CLA, which is even bigger than the fish oil.  I can handle them.. they're just massive compared to my other supplements.

Bye....
2526 2018-01-06 18:55:03 Nikki, what happened to the protesters killed in Venezuela? Why not mess with Maduro.- I know why: Trump staff is doing business with Maduro's oil. The stolen Venezuelan Patrimony.- bytheway Maduro's in laws are in the cocaine trade business as well. Don't tell you didn't know?
2527 2018-01-06 18:55:03 Arab Oil clubs and Man United are .
2528 2018-01-06 18:55:02 No I used a vegan coffee cake recipe as base but baked it in a bundt pan for shake. Used coconut oil & powdered sugar as icing. Not white bread-doughy like regular king cake but got the flavor I was craving.
2529 2018-01-06 18:54:57 There's lots more where Doug came from. Especially now that oil/gas producers are replacing workers with technology and the oil sands has moved from construction to optimization. It's a global trend within the industry.
2530 2018-01-06 18:54:45 I moisturize day and night. I also wash my face every night and when I wake up. I use pretty much just your general face moisturizer and then I apply an oily skin face oil. I let that set in for about 30 min or an hour and then I do my makeup or whatever.
2531 2018-01-06 18:54:38 Dispicable. California is having none of this. We will not allow any offshore oil to be sent to and or thru California. Problem solved. We are the tip off the spear. Now we can donate to the state charity to pay taxes. And still get full charitable deduction. That’s badass.
2532 2018-01-06 18:54:29 It's been left out of most analysis, but 5 years ago, 60M used to be astronomical. Lukaku went for 85 this season. These are just normal prices during the "oil era."
2533 2018-01-06 18:54:28 Need an oil change and my car washed 
2534 2018-01-06 18:54:28 @ASavageNation Re: Oil drilling. Yes, there's a glut, we don't need to drill, but the reason is that we sell our excess to Asia for $$$.
2535 2018-01-06 18:54:19 After shampoo, thoroughly massage COCONUT OIL, and wash out with Conditioner.
2536 2018-01-06 18:54:18 I'd switch to gas in a second. Unfortunately, no pipes in my neighborhood. Oil, electric, propane, or nothing.
2537 2018-01-06 18:54:16 Baby oil mixed with that coco butter. It's like milk does the boddy good lol
2538 2018-01-06 18:53:56 Injection wells, byproduct of fracking. We’re not going to stop needing oil so let’s find better ways of getting the oil. Full boar engineering geniuses needed...call out the creative minds and get them to collaborate. #engineering #creativesolutions #oilandgas
2539 2018-01-06 18:53:50 Let me rub you down in oil
2540 2018-01-06 18:53:42 Liberals: permanent war for oil, opiods, minerals; militarized police, surveillance state; record income inequality; privatization of water; fracking, GMOs.....
Far leftists: economic fairness and justice, worker's rights, housing rights, food rights, education rights...NICE.
2541 2018-01-06 18:53:30 That’s my guiding principle. Buy quality and take care of it, and you don’t have to replace. A little 3 in 1 oil goes a long way ;3
2542 2018-01-06 18:53:14 putting oil on your body after a nice hot shower >>>
2543 2018-01-06 18:53:13 I think it would depend on your skin type. I usually don’t use much oil on my face because my face already has sufficient oil but with the cold air making my skin so dry lately I’ve considered using more than I usually do!!
2544 2018-01-06 18:53:12 @GreenGoblinHD interested in trying the waffe 28 oil can II, or du you have it already?
2545 2018-01-06 18:53:10 And what about the rumor of the move to Lucas Oil?
2546 2018-01-06 18:53:09 So how exactly DID you get your head so far up your ass, butter bean? Lube? Olive Oil? Good old fashioned butter?
2547 2018-01-06 18:53:05 What about the 300 million + people in this country , and, not your entitled Fortune 100 companies. How are your oil profits doing. Take a swim in the waters you are going to destroy. 600 thousand oil spill, no regulations or fines for clean up anymore. Drown in your corruption.

2551 2018-01-06 18:52:34 Just poured hot oil on myself because I’m exhausted. But I promised @OsayanmoO plantain lasagne 
2552 2018-01-06 18:52:19 A Dutch oven or stock pot for the fryer and then can reuse the oil twice by filtering through coffee filter and a funnel back into jug.

2555 2018-01-06 18:52:08 Curious as to where we should  be getting our oil from.
2556 2018-01-06 18:51:36 Where did you get the amla oil?
2557 2018-01-06 18:51:36 Krill oil capsules are generally smaller if the size is a problem and get a similar benefit.
2558 2018-01-06 18:51:33 @RyanEdwards_5 lad don’t u fall over there you’ll strike oil #bignose 
2559 2018-01-06 18:51:29 Beard Balm - or - Beard Oil? That’s it. That’s the toughest decision of my Saturday.
2560 2018-01-06 18:51:24 If America needs help with offshore oil drilling they should consult with "socialist" Norway. They're the global experts through STATOIL which is almost entirely owned by the government of Norway.

2563 2018-01-06 18:50:41 In any other modern country the media would be drawing you over hot coals for this blatant lie. You are nothing but a snake oil salesman selling nothing but unionist pish
2564 2018-01-06 18:50:40 I’ve heard coconut oil is great for that too I’ve just never done it faithfully
2565 2018-01-06 18:50:33 Might be worthwhile to give the stem of the valve a drop of oil (or WD40 type stuff) while it works now - so it's less likely to get stuck again next time.
2566 2018-01-06 18:50:28 It’s obviously getting worse each day! Ian got chilli oil yesterday. No stonebake bases for weeks (months) though
2567 2018-01-06 18:50:17 SIS YOU JUST MAKE OFF SHORE DRILLING HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU HAD LOST MONEY IN OIL INVESTMENTS?
US now needs to see you TAXES because conflict of interest is now clearly seen as very possible and even insider trading via family and the senate that did not even read the tax bill= crime
2568 2018-01-06 18:50:15 Trump made a deal w SA to sell them weapons, let them put oil on stock exchange but they had to stop exporting Wahhabism, and arrest those who funded 9/11 and stop corrupting our politics. Will be a better world for it in the end. Cleaning out the closet often gets messier first.

2571 2018-01-06 18:49:40 You’re actually suggesting they auction listings? That is so absurdly unethical I don’t know where to start. We need to clean up this embarrassing mess of scams and snake oil our space has become.
2572 2018-01-06 18:49:26 I love being crazy! Woke up at 7am, filmed an entire morning routine, went to soul cycle & now I’m getting my oil changed & going to orientation! It’s only 10:49am! Waking up early is the life!
2573 2018-01-06 18:49:26 Next Trump will cite this weather to justify more offshore oil drilling.

2576 2018-01-06 18:49:07 Doesn't mean it will happen. Right now oil prices remain low. Offshore oil drilling is a real pain.
2577 2018-01-06 18:49:05 @adorbnabhorb thinks you can put cbd oil into an oil diffuser to get high

2583 2018-01-06 18:48:40 National Bank of Canada trading at 11x this year's earnings. That seems too reasonable given an outlook for rising rates, an improving North American economy, stable housing market, rapidly improving job market, strong oil pricing, record high Tsx. $NA.TO
2584 2018-01-06 18:48:39 Looks sick as f! I don’t use my vape that often, but if I end up getting that CBD oil vape juice stuff, I might use something like that in the future. How much did that put you back?
2585 2018-01-06 18:48:18 My skin so dry I have to use Eucerin, rose water mixed with glycerin, coconut oil and shea butter 
2586 2018-01-06 18:48:18 I do bro but that shits money down the drain niggas oil cost gas prices
2587 2018-01-06 18:48:01 Heat ur oil Na, then add pepper(lot of pepper) onion(u,can add onions and locust beans before pepper too ur choice) then fish meat, crayfish and what have you add reasonable quantity of salt and seasoning stir and taste when u are satisfied, add water leaf stir for few mins
2588 2018-01-06 18:47:59 You’re right. I’ve always preferred showers. But being really ill at the mo all I want is a nice hot bath with some eucalyptus oil and then a spoon in bed!
2589 2018-01-06 18:47:53 I hate getting a oil change
2590 2018-01-06 18:47:51 And the linebackers are drenched in holy oil
2591 2018-01-06 18:47:40 and keep being dependant on foreign oil!!! brilliant!! Mr RESISTER the POTUS is MAGA either join him or get out of the way, can't you do anything bipartisan? that is meaningful??pathetic!! better get used to President Trump!! 2020
2592 2018-01-06 18:47:39 dear @EUCouncil, you’re hands are filthy from the revolution up until the emergency meeting where u betrayed protestors. We will remember. And once we destroy the islamic regime, we’ll starve u of our rich oil. #IranianProtest #IranProtests #FreeIran

2601 2018-01-06 18:46:56 I woke up to my mom blessing my forehead with holy oil
2602 2018-01-06 18:46:25 Why would I believe anything that secretary Tillerson  says he is an X Exxon oil executive totally geared & blueprinted for profit Is an amateur just like Trump and I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him Both lack diplomacy and knowledge of Gov & multicultural nation
2603 2018-01-06 18:46:20 in closing Manchester City fans just became Manchester City fans once they were sold to Russian oil and started to compete. No history whatsoever.
2604 2018-01-06 18:46:06 I don't think he counts any before 2016 because he was such a crappy candidate he never made it to the primaries.  When he had the full force of the russian government in 2016 he went full snake oil and managed to win the primary and election.  Surprise.
2605 2018-01-06 18:46:01 I hate the oil spots I get when surfing, and the sulfur small in the well water in Santa Barbara, but I’d be more sympathetic if you were either empathetic or honest about your contribution to the #metoo problem #NoConfidence
2606 2018-01-06 18:45:51 Perhaps if oil companies paid for depleting national resources rather than us subsidizing their business and giving them tax breaks, we could build 1st world schools and heat them adequately.
2607 2018-01-06 18:45:41 Holy crap you can fry sticky rice in olive oil.
2608 2018-01-06 18:45:29 BUT NOW investigations into signing tax bill without reading it and investing into OIL just before new drilling and deregulation that now permit abuse and crimes they existed to prevent from tax to oil....Trump and gang investigations
2609 2018-01-06 18:45:28 
2610 2018-01-06 18:45:22 If you’ve never had olive oil in your ear for an ear infection I wouldn’t recommend it!
2611 2018-01-06 18:45:19 oh yeah, and the "oil rig" platform--which was admittedly pretty sikk; it worked best outside with rocks and shit
2612 2018-01-06 18:45:18 And something I personally think is shady, Rex Tillerson and Putin have tried to make billion $ oil deals for the Arctic  which Obama stopped &now he is Secretary of State.

Solar, Wind, Oil, Coal, Natural Gas, And when used properly help us all.
I don't condemn one to help another. We need to learn how to use them to ur Maxium Benefit.
That's the Challenge.
2614 2018-01-06 18:45:11 Snake oil salesman.
2615 2018-01-06 18:45:04 You can stop using as much oil. Demand has to be met. Right now, my coast gets yo pay the price for all of you still using it. Louisiana is practically a dead zone when it cones to shoreline.
2616 2018-01-06 18:45:02 1st, "Eating vegan" & "being Vegan" are different. 1 is diet, other is way of life. The way eating "Whole Food Plant Based" (WFPB) isn't just eating vegan is that you cut out processed foods. Ex: Oreos & Fritos are vegan, but not healthy. Also, cut out added salt, sugar, & oil.
2617 2018-01-06 18:45:00 Of course, Obama had an oil rig that leaked 4.9 million BARRELS of oil but,.. hey.
2618 2018-01-06 18:44:56 Uggh... why must fish oil capsules and CLA capsules be so.... freaking.... HUGE??
2619 2018-01-06 18:44:46 You have to roast them with olive oil, maple syrup & balsemic vinegar.  Try that & let me know what you think.  #brusselsprouts #organic #HealthyLiving
2620 2018-01-06 18:44:42 Why don't you tell the truth about big oil and the way all the oil goes out to a worldwide market and sold to the highest bidder. Not one drop of that oil will never see American markets till it goes out and then brought back by the same companies

2622 2018-01-06 18:44:04 gotta step it up w the oil potna 
2623 2018-01-06 18:43:50 Thank you. I live in Santa Barbara, one of the most beautiful and special coastlines in the world. The environmental movement  started here in ‘69 because of that huge oil spill. We are committed to it NEVER happening again.
2624 2018-01-06 18:43:47 Litteraly just eat olive oil lmao but fish has good fats in it an protein
2625 2018-01-06 18:43:44 argh like i’ve always wanted to learn oil painting bc it’s like the og art but?? idk i might be able to because it’s been ages since i even tried? but yeah expensive + then taking all of the shit back to aus in my suitcase will suck
2626 2018-01-06 18:43:34 So let's concentrate all the destruction on the Gulf Coast then? We're all still using oil- it has to come from somewhere. So my beaches & environment get to pay the price for all of you still driving? How about we force different regs to make it safer?
2627 2018-01-06 18:43:18 Tea tree oil as a moisturizer, face masks a couple times a week, simply washing your face before going to sleep to get the dirt off
2628 2018-01-06 18:43:13 Synthetics all the way because that's plain disgusting either way. yuck. 

Just like how I don't ever want to find out how emu oil is made or extracted. 
2629 2018-01-06 18:43:09 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
2630 2018-01-06 18:42:55 Wish they hurry up with this fucking oil change my phn about to die
2631 2018-01-06 18:42:48 I really don’t do much , i just do wash and gos an I’ve been using coconut oil since I’ve been natural
2632 2018-01-06 18:42:43 Oil change & a little grocery shopping. Then date night 
2633 2018-01-06 18:42:35 And you can hardly say 'everyone" loves him. Bamboozled by the snake oil salesman perhaps. I believe 'everyone' will at some point, if not already, be very sorry he was appointed your President.
2634 2018-01-06 18:42:20 No. Link arms or hold hands in a circle.
2635 2018-01-06 18:42:11 2. Has zero benefit to or for the US Citizenry or the price of gasoline, etc. It is solely to extract oil & gas to be exported by private enterprises to places US military force is deployed to prevents people from obtaining energy from other sources - e.g., Russia. (con)
2636 2018-01-06 18:42:07 I hate the way coconut oil makes my hair smell

It's one of the key ingredients in this expensive hair oil I bought.
2637 2018-01-06 18:41:33 while stupidass Trump has opened up all US coastal waters to oil exploration & drilling. Welcome to America

2639 2018-01-06 18:41:32 And the remaining 12% do not resemblespeed boats and oil tankers!
2640 2018-01-06 18:41:31 Keep selling that snake oil
2641 2018-01-06 18:41:24 i had this kitchen malfunction. apparently i was frying something then most of the oil went out of the frying pan, into the burning flame and it caused a 8 ft tall flame to suddenly appear.
2642 2018-01-06 18:41:20 Ultras sneak in corn dogs to Lucas Oil.
2643 2018-01-06 18:41:15 I agree it is unfair for one country to have this leverage. Maybe there will be a new order based on multilateral treaty. But IMO, US wld be right to penalize TR. US carved out exception for TR purchase of IR oil, and TR dishonestly exploited it to defeat sanctions.
2644 2018-01-06 18:41:06 Hello, Twitter operator? Can someone transfer me to natural Twitter? I need to ask about a sugar skin scrub with coconut oil. Please? Thank you.
2645 2018-01-06 18:40:58 Board game idea: Sexy Clue
Upon finding a mysterious stain, you must determine the culprit.
Example: Col. Mustard, in the bedroom, with the massage oil
2646 2018-01-06 18:40:57 Agreed. His tweets drive me crazy. He should be more like Obama. Hide his ego behind a slick car salesman presentation, lie, and screw Americans for 8 years. Snake oil salesmen like Obama and Clinton were SO much better.
2647 2018-01-06 18:40:56 On top of that he is unleashing the energy of the US. No more need to purchase oil from other countries when we have our own. Saving money again.
2648 2018-01-06 18:40:44 Sounds the same I’ve had problems with build up for years so I know what you’re going through it’s not fun, warm olive oil to soften the wax helps, try not to get frustrated trying to clear your ears, unfortunately it’s a patience game
2649 2018-01-06 18:40:39 okay i,,,, want to do an oil painting but i CANNOT work with oils and i’d have to buy all the supplies so like
2650 2018-01-06 18:40:25 Lets see. What happened when we learned Cheney/Bush lied US into attacking/invading countries that didnt attack us, for oil/drugs/money? Or that we tortured? Locked ppl indefinitely in an illegal prison? Bombed innocent? A: Nothing. The WarCriminals became lovable darings. So...
2651 2018-01-06 18:40:24 So if I douse myself in lemon oil I'll be magically calmed. This is how this works, right?
2652 2018-01-06 18:40:23 The BBQ sauce and chilli oil is also not available for sale.
2653 2018-01-06 18:40:15 Nothing like writing about the miracles of modern medicine while I try and cure myself of flu with a box of Jaffa Cakes and some Olbas Oil.
2654 2018-01-06 18:40:08 Yes. It’s amazing that when it’s cold out, people still go to work. Please thank your employees for getting their oil@changed regularly as well. We appreciate the inconvenienceto the recipients of government hand outs.
2655 2018-01-06 18:40:08 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
2656 2018-01-06 18:40:05 Frying plantain & accidentally dropped one. My reaction time to jump back from the oil yeah? If I react like that out the blocks it’s a wrap 
2657 2018-01-06 18:40:02 @castorpolluxpet Considering your dry #petfood for one of my cats. Concerns are high level of grains/filler starches; fish meals in a chicken recipe; +questions about your chicken fat source, quality, storage & testing. Your other food contains salmon oil (would rather it didn't)
2658 2018-01-06 18:39:57 Exam mundhu rathrantha kurchoni chadhavadam burning midnight oil antaru... team agnyaathavaasi inchu minchu adhe chesthundhi! #AgnyaathavaasiTrailer
2659 2018-01-06 18:39:55 Have to drive price up to make people demand lower prices, which means opening up new off-shore oil fields gets pushed through, which means more profits!
2660 2018-01-06 18:39:34 I'm waiting at the oil change place to see if my car is too low to even get inside lmao I might have to start doing my own oil
2661 2018-01-06 18:39:31 Yes I use it to wipe the dipstick when I check the oil on the car.
2662 2018-01-06 18:39:23 I read that tea tree oil is really good
2663 2018-01-06 18:39:13 @onesmileymonkey I take a dose of vitamin C and oregano oil as soon as I feel the beginning of cold or flu #ShoppersFlu
2664 2018-01-06 18:39:03 roads are slickest when rain has just started and hasn't had time to blockchain away the oil
2665 2018-01-06 18:38:48 Prologue excerpt: “I have, through a consistency in the accounts and through sources I have come to trust, settled on a version of events I believe to be true[...]”
Things I would use #FireAndFury for:
- Toilet Paper
- Kindling for shit burning detail
- Oil rags
2666 2018-01-06 18:38:43 After doing independent research on America, we are almost always the largest consumer of just about everything. From oil to meat, milk, and whatever China is selling
2667 2018-01-06 18:38:39 i think oil works
2668 2018-01-06 18:38:19 More snake oil pitch......demonstrates his low IQ...
2669 2018-01-06 18:38:14 Removing regs are our environment is bad. Keystone. More oil spills coming.
2670 2018-01-06 18:38:09 Until oil from the offshore drilling Trump now okayed for the Pacific Coast leaks a BP level spill into that and other marine sanctuaries
2671 2018-01-06 18:37:56 the only thing i can do about is moisturizer and tea tree oil but thats all i guess OH
2672 2018-01-06 18:37:54 You’re lucky I’m high haha. I’d just ask them to make one half like you’d eat it now, then on the other half if you get like oil/vinegar/anything like that in a separate container. I’ve seen it happen, you won’t piss them off haha
2673 2018-01-06 18:37:44 And Trump’s #TaxBilk removed the 9-cent per barrel tax to pay for oil spill cleanup. More pandering to big oil & oil lobbyists, and another hit at all coastal states.
2674 2018-01-06 18:37:44 Coconut Oil makes for a fantastic texture to the coffee, and it offers the bonus of moisturizing your lips as you drink!
2675 2018-01-06 18:37:41 Use a carrier! Don’t use it straight up. But a few drops in your avocado oil.
2676 2018-01-06 18:37:39 I second this. I do what my half Italian mom does, which is what her Nonna did, which is boil the pasta with a pinch of salt (no oil), and strain out the water when it's al dente. Add sauce. Perfect every time.
2677 2018-01-06 18:37:36 Also coconut oil is extremely drying in the long run. I agree that tea tree oil is good also a frankincense essential oil mixed with a carrier oil like a jojoba oil.
2678 2018-01-06 18:37:22 All the small shit like spark plugs , ignition coils and shit fuck with me. I'll show you how to finesse that oil change an all.
2679 2018-01-06 18:37:12 I'd make a tomato & onion masala with Cirio tomatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, turmeric, coriander, chili, oil, cumin seeds and garam masala, it's quick, easy and tasty
2680 2018-01-06 18:37:07 This guy fixed my sisters almost totaled car for free as long as he can take her out on a date. Cnskfnsksnamsk bitch I can’t even get a free oil change wtf.
2681 2018-01-06 18:36:32 Isn’t that why Manchester City is so good all of a sudden?  Bunch of oil money?
2682 2018-01-06 18:36:29 Good one! I prefer Well - Oil - Beef - Hooked, personally.
2683 2018-01-06 18:36:26 Eucalyptus oil helps.
2684 2018-01-06 18:36:13 Ya skin needs tea tree oil and vitamin E, game changers
2685 2018-01-06 18:36:09 Va cañas 
Va Fuel Oil
2686 2018-01-06 18:35:57 Got me some bio oil this better work cause I spent €20 on it
2687 2018-01-06 18:35:56 I am listening to you on MSNBC.  You are an embarrassment to this State.  Can't wait for mid-term elections to throw you out of Congress.   How can you support corrupt, bigot, sexual predator Trump? Oil drlling in our shores? Really????
2688 2018-01-06 18:35:40 Totally, totally tone deaf. So far we’ve had tweets on laying wreaths, a grange award, a singing cop and her outrage at oil drilling off the coast of Maine. 

@SenatorCollins you voted to Zinke and you voted for drilling in the ANWR. Your “outrage” and “good deeds” don’t cut it.
2689 2018-01-06 18:35:40 I dont feel like gettin a oil change at all
2690 2018-01-06 18:35:35 Chefs and foodies, what kind of truffle oil do you prefer?
2691 2018-01-06 18:35:05 There is some oil North East of Uganda, the way land is being bought n captured. We shall find out in a few years.
2692 2018-01-06 18:34:49 The Money the club has spent has been generated by the club its self city have been funded solely on Arab oil money that's the difference city deserve no credit or comparison what so ever
2693 2018-01-06 18:34:48 Whenever I hear #BitCoin is a bubble: Remember when the first motorcars  came out? Ppl said oil was in the ground for millions of yrs. these prices for oil are a bubble, after all motorcars are just a fad  Altcoins/tokens are the future. Buy!
2694 2018-01-06 18:34:47 Don’t forget to put coconut oil in your hair when you in the sauna 
2695 2018-01-06 18:34:46 ギュメイ将軍そんなに強くないね。

まぁ、スライムジェネラルみたいにポンポン仲間呼ぶのも考えもんだけどさ。
2696 2018-01-06 18:34:45 When the price reaches $70, oil status will be regraded from "worthless" to "running out".
2697 2018-01-06 18:34:44 @girlscouts quick question-is the palm oil you use in your cookies contributing to rainforest destruction and loss of habitat? Or have you certified what your manufacturers use?
2698 2018-01-06 18:34:41 Now you're confusing yourself UK still imports more than it produces so duty not all down to NS oil and gas
2699 2018-01-06 18:34:32 Russian oil tankers continue to supply North Korea with fuel in violation of UN and US sanctions.

Yet Trump says NOTHING.

Connect the dots.
2700 2018-01-06 18:34:25 Toast a little ciabatta bread, put on some Brie, tomatoes, onions and some olive oil with salt and pepper and then thank me later! 
2701 2018-01-06 18:34:24 Castor oil
2702 2018-01-06 18:34:23 need to go get an oil change
2703 2018-01-06 18:34:18 似合ってますね☺︎
綺麗です
2704 2018-01-06 18:34:10 the old Crisp'n'Dry ad... "mama dont like no fat on food from no cooking oil, mama dont like no grease on food from no cooooking oiiil..."
2705 2018-01-06 18:34:08 But...But Better Together & Sir Ian Wood said there was only 10yrs of oil left after David Cameron flew a secret flight to Shetland and had a meeting with the BP Bigwigs...wait a moment... West of Shetland... Nah must be running out - and it is volatile
2706 2018-01-06 18:34:06 Going to get anything done to my car makes me nervous that I’ll get an oil change and they’ll be like “yeah it’s about to explode.”
2707 2018-01-06 18:34:04 A “genius” businessman is one who got lucky or who was invested in a certain market at the right point in time.  With  Vanderbilt it was railroads.  The Rockefellers through oil and banking.  You through nepotism and that’s it - diddly squat.
2708 2018-01-06 18:34:04 Wow this oil of oregano is working wonders on my stomach !!!! It's all natural, good for me, AND it's REALLY helping my stomach problems! Yay! I highly recommend oil of oregano!!! #herbalmedicine #nomorestomachaches
2709 2018-01-06 18:33:41 The oil wrestling wasn’t bringing them in.
2710 2018-01-06 18:33:34 but DO NOT INAYA out witch hazel like just plain out on your skin. mix it together with the jojoba oil.
2711 2018-01-06 18:33:33 get some castor oil + coconut oil and rub that in after a wash 

figured that out last year, haven't looked back
2712 2018-01-06 18:33:33 sorry if this is bad, but how about this cookie:
linseed oil
gabon nut
oroblanco zest
a book you like
2713 2018-01-06 18:33:33 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
2714 2018-01-06 18:33:33 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2715 2018-01-06 18:33:33 a wise man once said that when the orange man tweets, more than one earthling subscibes to the #NYT
2716 2018-01-06 18:33:33 what kind of sapphic are you: an oil paint sapphic or a fingerpaint sapphic?
2717 2018-01-06 18:33:31 We are a selling club make no mistake about it. Been saying it for years. Salah will be next until. We don't have the oil money unfortunately
2718 2018-01-06 18:33:28 Trying to get my oil changed and I’m having a panic attack. Like please can’t they understand I just want one thing done and I don’t want or know anything else about my car?
2719 2018-01-06 18:33:22 Fish oil pills improve my mood, but I still wish I could unsee that lady Donald Ducking around the gym locker room.
2720 2018-01-06 18:33:18 I take it that Big Oil wasn't willing to dangle a payoff. That was shortsighted on their part -- they wouldn't have even had to follow through on it in your case.
2721 2018-01-06 18:33:10 The Face Shop Rice Water Cleansing Oil is pretty good for general and waterproof makeup. With waterproof you have do it a second time to completely clean it, but the oil is so gentle I can do it again and again.
2722 2018-01-06 18:32:56 I’m so happy for myself, finally getting my oil changed. Lol lucky I made it this far
2723 2018-01-06 18:32:55 I've already looked at your horn it's gotta be a wiring problem Wich I don't deal with I don't do electrical you know this and I keep telling you to bring your car in one day you Know if you buy the oil and filter I'll put it on my rack one day when I clock out and change it
2724 2018-01-06 18:32:49 and i use jojoba oil to moisturizer and if you put witch hazel on pimples or acne scare it helps them go away or get smaller. also if you take aspirin and cut it in half & place it in a small amount of water. it will turn into a paste. you put the paste on a pimple, it will dry.
2725 2018-01-06 18:32:44 Wax it or oil it to repel H2O
2726 2018-01-06 18:32:43 Woke up early enough to be first in line to get my oil change and I pre-approved for a credit card 
2727 2018-01-06 18:32:35 Are you deeply concerned about Russia being caught delivering oil to NK? Before we go down the sanctions road with China, how about demanding that POTUS implement the sanctions that were supposed to be placed on Russia six months ago? Do your job you spineless lackey.
2728 2018-01-06 18:32:28 If you don’t use wild growth oil.... idk what to tell you. My hair is SO THICK AND GOT SO LONG! I’m not joking.
2729 2018-01-06 18:32:20 You sir are a special kind of snake oil salesman....
2730 2018-01-06 18:32:18 I wish people would read the studies on both castor oil and pitocin. Castor oil has actually been found to NOT increase poor outcomes or cause meconium. Pitocin has been proven TO increase poor outcomes and cause Fetal distress. Obviously neither are ideal...
2731 2018-01-06 18:31:46 Fire and Fury book said that Rex doesn't know nothing expect Oil...
2732 2018-01-06 18:31:29 Having a car is cool and all until you have to pay for gas, get new tires, have your oil changed. 
2733 2018-01-06 18:31:26 an oil is the mary of a hell
the broccolis could be said to resemble windburned helle
2734 2018-01-06 18:31:25 안돼ㅠㅠㅠ... 오늘 또 허튼(?)공약 걸어둔거 아니죠ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 제 마음이 넘 조마조마해요(?  몇마리 보냅니다...
2735 2018-01-06 18:31:17 LBC or CNN,Maajid said nothing while a list of Trump achievement were listed,but as soon As the word freezing was said he went off. It’s called season change not Climate change,C/change is due to oil/petrol,felling rain forests,industry,which the people aren’t told about. #Brexit
2736 2018-01-06 18:30:59 they look worse than they are - experiment to honey roast some just over did the time/oil a bit - a little bitter but the honey and salt drags em back

edible... :)
2737 2018-01-06 18:30:43 Honey, egg whites & lemon face masks on the weekend, Bioderma moisturizer (face) before bed every night + baby oil (body) after showering
2738 2018-01-06 18:30:32 Lots and lots of conditioner. Oil might help too.
2739 2018-01-06 18:30:27 I just started using something called Best Damn Beard Oil. Duke Cannon. Redweed scent.
2740 2018-01-06 18:30:19 And John Swinney isn't a respected oil person.
2741 2018-01-06 18:30:14 scrubbing your scalp with a sugar olive oil mixture and then washing it like normal helps a lot believe it or not!
2742 2018-01-06 18:30:03 No I don’t put olive oil on steak.
2743 2018-01-06 18:30:01 And I can't believe there is a store that just sells olive oil and balsamic vinegar but then I just put Worcestershire Sauce on everything I cook.
2744 2018-01-06 18:29:40 Also the car tells you when something is wrong with it when it’s time for an oil check, tire going flat, maintenance needed all that
2745 2018-01-06 18:29:39 My horns been broke for about 4 months or more & my oil hasn’t been checked in a while but yet Tj is a mechanic & still nothing gets done ??
2746 2018-01-06 18:29:33 Instagram and Facebook have really revitalised the snake oil beauty infomercial scene
2747 2018-01-06 18:29:28 Dmv Oil change
2748 2018-01-06 18:29:27 Plenty of unstable people have become world leaders - Hitler? Mussolini? You fit right in. As for genius? It doesn't take a genius to be a snake oil salesman and con man.
2749 2018-01-06 18:29:24 Ringgit stregthen due to oil price stable.

2752 2018-01-06 18:29:10 Wife has bad arthritis pain and looking at using CBD oil. Anyone have any expereince with using CBD for that?
2753 2018-01-06 18:29:01 Thank you ngigeza nge sunlight bar soap and then I use castor oil that's all.
2754 2018-01-06 18:29:00 In the time it took me to detangle and oil my hair, this nigga got hard and busted a nut. He came back and i still wasn’t done ):
2755 2018-01-06 18:28:45 You will be sent to jail for endorsing a hair treatment oil
2756 2018-01-06 18:28:37 Yeh kid have fun on your stadium tour funded by your dads oil money. Now jog on and glory hunt some more.
2757 2018-01-06 18:28:37 Waitress: Girl your EYELASHES. Caster oil is not working for me. 
Me: Thanks! I use a serum that's biotin, keratin and peptides. 
W: yeah you're gonna need to tell me about that. 
Literally this is too easy 
2758 2018-01-06 18:28:32 Salad dressing from raspberry jam, sesame oil, a little rice vinegar and plumped cranberries. Pinch of tarragon. O, and almonds.
2759 2018-01-06 18:28:13 Not sure about the 'most' part, but if you identify a group combining pain and ignorance you can point to a scapegoat while selling them snake oil.
2760 2018-01-06 18:28:12 I need the details on a beard oil routine and some hair care tips. I feel like I’m living at hair my hair potential. Gotta be more to life than this olive oil lotion and blue magic. #blackhair
2761 2018-01-06 18:28:09 Bravo Mr. Woods, very well stated & it's the brutal truth! Gore is one of the greatest "Snake Oil" "Scam Artists" of our times!!! How can these uninformed/vulnerable/stupid Liberals not recognizing when they've been had???
2762 2018-01-06 18:28:02 Agreed. It's already affected by what is there. When I visited UCSB I walked on the beach and had to be wary of oil beads on the sand. The oil gets stuck to your feet and it's awful to get off. Imagine how it is for marine life that LIVE in it!!!
2763 2018-01-06 18:28:01 Depends on so many things. Price of oil, costs to produce & rate of production. These will determine the profit or loss for the producer which in turn will determine the tax receipts
2764 2018-01-06 18:27:52 Dude I haven't gone that far to start liking harper . He was just lucky to be in power when oil was high
2765 2018-01-06 18:27:42 Next target : tea tree oil from the body shop

2767 2018-01-06 18:27:27 Bruh having a car is like having a kid, you gotta worry bout parking decals for school, gas, cartags, oil change and stuff. Might as throw the whole car away
2768 2018-01-06 18:27:22 They don't do anything to hurt the environment but as you say "they are awful" in context. You must be a special kind of stupid to think in these leftist ways. And I will point out again that windmills and solar farms kill more birds and animals than the oil rig in the middle of
2769 2018-01-06 18:27:19 How many miles before he changes the oil in his hair?
2770 2018-01-06 18:27:14 Incredulity is not a valid reason to dismiss what I've wrote. How can Venezuela get US $s to pay off the bonds it offered in US $s? What happened to oil production and the oil price? If you can't get your hands on US $s, how can you pay off the bonds that are denominated in $s?
2771 2018-01-06 18:27:04 Vegetable oil is used to make biodiesel and has about doubled in price in the last couple years. Reports in 2007 linked stories as diverse as food riots in Mexico due to rising prices of corn for tortillas  .Thatswhy to reduce our carbon footprint
2772 2018-01-06 18:27:01 Now that they found fossils on Mars, we can drill for oil there  too
2773 2018-01-06 18:26:57 Donor's are mostly Big Oil! What dose Exxon Koch's Putin Tillerson BP Shell Chevron have in common?? Fossil Fuels! Who's future is dying! Oil & should have 20yrs ago! Their in it together & they only care about ! They'll screw anyone that gets in their way! Unite 2 fight!
2774 2018-01-06 18:26:47 I bet you use the same olive oil to drizzle over your pasta as your steak!  That’s barbaric, my friend! 
2775 2018-01-06 18:26:46 Venny to issue 100 million Petro crypto currency units next week #backed  by oil reserves  . Convertible ??? As risk of default  intensifies switches  out of sovereign debt to pdvsa increase  but price differential perhaps not worth it
2776 2018-01-06 18:26:26 @BellaTwins  hey Brie you made a video about using witch hazel some other type of oil and pads after you gave birth to Birdie....what did you use? My sister is having a baby and I want her to use that instead of the chemicals
2777 2018-01-06 18:26:26 And Carter musta done something severely wrong to inspire Herbert Walker Bush & his puppet Reagan to ascend after 1 term... No? Dissing Oil?
2778 2018-01-06 18:26:24 Dear @atmaz the All Powerful ,

Sorry for being disruptive and calling you a beta male cuck .You have shown me that I am but a mere peasant in your domain by delivering me your dreaded ban hammer.

Sincereley yours

2781 2018-01-06 18:26:02 I can't believe I've never been to @UnrefinedOlive before today. I'm hooked! Bought truffle oil and two kinds of olive oil. #GourMeg
2782 2018-01-06 18:25:55 Sinator common sense no sharp atalll..no fact and oil
2783 2018-01-06 18:25:48 I am really upset about the proposed increased oil drilling off the coasts of FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA.
2784 2018-01-06 18:25:46 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.

2785 2018-01-06 18:25:45 Brah I wish the staff and customers still had them moves. Now it's just old people tryna decide if they wanna buy an oil painting starter kit or some water colour pencils.
2786 2018-01-06 18:25:41 #LOTTOMAX won again east of the prairies ! What a shocker . West continues  to support the east . If it ain't oil royalties,  it's lottery money.
2787 2018-01-06 18:25:17 Norway has a state oil company, yes I am having to point out the obvious aren't I Frank. Understand Frank, the SNP aren't proposing a state oil company, yes?
2788 2018-01-06 18:25:10 I finally got on the oil diffuser train, and have been using for about 2 weeks. We use it while we sleep, and hubby has said he wakes up without a headache & stuffed nose now. Yay for diffusers!
2789 2018-01-06 18:25:00 Cannot believe we ran out of oil today. Terrible timing.

2791 2018-01-06 18:24:45 Nah man after lol kinda like smoking a cig after eating, but with oil
2792 2018-01-06 18:24:44 Kampala that was nearly 50yrs ago. most ppl don’t know  that they have been drilling in Prudhoe Bay Alaska for over 40 years. Ever since then the Caribou, Red Fox and Brown Bears  have made a magical recovery Why? security around the oil fields drove away the poachers
2793 2018-01-06 18:24:42 Plus, we will need that paper to make paper towels out of to clean up all the oil spills as you voted for the oil industry, which was taxed 9 cents per barrel for cleanup that went to zero on the 1st day of January.
2794 2018-01-06 18:24:42 I need my oil changed TODAY
2795 2018-01-06 18:24:39 These facts are proven and you are saying all oil rigs are ruining the environment and in which case they really don't do anything but create an area for harboring fish species but you are too incompetent to see these things. Oil rigs really don't turn the coast into a wasteland.
2796 2018-01-06 18:24:37 does anyone use coconut oil on their face??? like I use it all over every night but I've always been afraid it'll make my face a greasy mess
2797 2018-01-06 18:24:34 im doing a deep conditioning thing w coconut oil and i look like i haven't showered on 3 months... A look

2801 2018-01-06 18:24:00 You voted for more drilling, asshole.  Enjoy your oil covered coastlines.
2802 2018-01-06 18:23:54 Great!  Now please also condemn Trump admin. handing over OUR #publiclands and #MonumentsForAll to oil/gas/mining, because we, too, want to drink clean water, breathe clean air, and provide healthy habitats for all #wildlife.
2803 2018-01-06 18:23:49 Lol castor oil tastes like... Oil  anyway
2804 2018-01-06 18:23:45 Yep. Think what global gas markets would look like without US shale! Prices would be sky-high. Here in the US coal plants would be going in not out and our CO2 emissions heading up not down. And oil would probably be $200/b! Mind-blowing.
2805 2018-01-06 18:23:44 แต่ตอนนี้บอกตรงๆเย็ดมึงกูว่าไปเย็ดกระหรี่ยังดีกว่าคนอย่างมึงหมายังเย็ดใด้
2806 2018-01-06 18:23:30 Use coconut oil 
2807 2018-01-06 18:23:08 I know I’ve tweeted abt this before, but I have something real to say about those essential oil salespeople on FB. First things first, what is happening? A MULTILEVEL MARKETING SCHEME.
2808 2018-01-06 18:23:02 Just made myself the vegetarian equivalent of a Sloppy Joe.

Sliced onion & mushrooms lightly fried in vegetable oil and Lee & Perrins, served in a fresh granary bun - yum!
2809 2018-01-06 18:22:58 @MSNBC please move on from Bannon and book discussion. There are plenty of news  topics that need attention..company lay offs, oil drilling,  Trumps wasteful investigations. Session attacking state rights and legal weed, etc
2810 2018-01-06 18:22:54 I am pragmatic enough to know that the Californian ohshore oil will eventually be drilled. 

HOWEVER, it would be monumentally stupid to do it now. Much better to wait until oil prices are MUCH higher and drilling technology is much better.
2811 2018-01-06 18:22:52 If the cost of production is lower it can lead to more revenue for the exchequer.  Oil would not be a curse to an independent Scotland but neither should it be a cornerstone of the economy. The UK doesn't get the same tax take as Norway.
2812 2018-01-06 18:22:37 Ima go take the Tahoe for an oil change and hopefully that don’t take long

2817 2018-01-06 18:21:44 I don't even have the right words to describe Bakayoko's stupidity .. That dude should be exchanged for Mobil 1000 Engine Oil ..
2818 2018-01-06 18:21:40 This conversation would play out no differently on my end if @AIPAC were replaced with big pharma, defense contactors, telecommunications, Saudi's, Ukrainian's, oil, sugar, tobacco, lead, ect.
2819 2018-01-06 18:21:39 No this is the thing that Alex Salmond screwed up by broadcasting his complete lack of understanding of the oil and gas industry, which is the same level as @GilMPaterson and he's making the same mistakes...laughable

2824 2018-01-06 18:20:44 *The frame around the painting is made of dark, scented wood, warm to the touch and polished with oils and no lacquer, clearly hand-made. The picture itself is an oil painting  with a scene she might find familiar: -
2825 2018-01-06 18:20:21 What caused that oil spill, and tell us the damage that still exists.
2826 2018-01-06 18:20:06 The raw amount of MW from coal and oil can't be replaced with just wind and solar. Plus, wind & solar depend on wind and cloudless skies. Coal & Oil work, no matter the weather. We can cut oil and coal, if we wat to lose reliable power and gain rolling blackouts.

2833 2018-01-06 18:19:02 You have to understand the difference between the estimated amount of oil, the price of the oil and what is recoverable at a profit. You haven't even tried.

2841 2018-01-06 18:17:08 I’ve not. The simple fact is just like the Glazers they’ll suck you dry. And like united fans, instead of protesting you’ll just sit there and shout “oil club” as if anyone’s bothered. Scumbags, same at Arsenal

2846 2018-01-06 18:16:51 No fracking in New England or upstate New York. No new pipelines for natgas. New England relies on the worst of the worst heating oil not too freeze to death. What morons. Wait. They'll want an investigation on high heating oil prices no one else uses.

2849 2018-01-06 18:16:41 of course @realDonaldTrump wants to drill for oil down the shore. prick. #JerseyShore
2850 2018-01-06 18:16:40 @EdRogersDC by the way instead of whining about Clinton FAKE NEWS tells about Bush Jr who left an 8 yr mess for clean up by successor from pseudo war (oil/Israel) & bullying allies into participation
2851 2018-01-06 18:16:36 Oh dear! What happens when the oil runs out u .u go bust 
2852 2018-01-06 18:16:29 The FSGOUT crowd not happy until we have oil money. Football is a business now and therefore should be run like a business. Shame UEFA are too weak to actually enforce FFP.
2853 2018-01-06 18:16:25 Donald Trump not only made America great again but through his policies, America is no longer at the mercy of foreign oil producers, being manipulated and intimidated and Muslims countries are introducing and implementing reforms that makes their people more happy and prosperous.
2854 2018-01-06 18:16:20 So, you're okay with Alaska's pristine areas being opened up for oil exploration, but God forbid Maine should be affected....you're a hypocrite!

2858 2018-01-06 18:15:59 Man City.. because their money is oil money, endless.. ours isn’t! Mate, you’re the only moron around here.
2859 2018-01-06 18:15:50 Impose $100 tax on every barrel of oil that spills into CA water/land. Make it a $1,000, why not? Federal clean-up tax (1 cent a barrel, ridiculously low) was scrapped by #TaxScam. Coastal states should step up to fill the gap & make GOP & big oil rue the day.
2860 2018-01-06 18:15:43 If u really want to waste time go to Walmart and get an oil change
2861 2018-01-06 18:15:42 Gym - you're better than me.  Maybe try just rinsing in just water. Sorry no expert but I think the idea is that you let your hair find its natural balance. Shampoo strips it of all its own oil completely.

2895 2018-01-06 18:12:40 funny how you only ever advocate for comfortable high paid jobs, where is your advocacy for Bomb Squad Expert $52,500, Coal Miner $53,500, Oil Well Driller $101,000 etc etc no not interested ? well there's your answer.
2896 2018-01-06 18:12:23 Interesting. Still, nobody dies from solar energy or wind energy. People die/are poisoned all the time from coal/gas/oil energy, not to mention all the wars over oil.
2897 2018-01-06 18:12:08 No, that was decline, not collapse, firstly.

Secondly, oil at $150 harmed US and world economy, simply due to the 2nd law of thermodynamics, shortage of energy.

2902 2018-01-06 18:11:38 Also there was a report last year that established that he would have fared better financially if he didn’t start any of those businesses and just put his inheritance in a modestly-performing mutual fund. He’s a snake oil salesman, period.

2920 2018-01-06 18:09:30 Tb esta el tema demanda, yo pienso que diesel va a caer, Nafta eventualmente tb y fuel oil para barcos tb. Todo esto en 10-20 años.
2921 2018-01-06 18:09:12 My point is shale oil producers can produce at a cheaper price because of automation, and I am surprised i am having to point out the obvious. I feel sorry for supporters of independence praying for high oil prices just to make any independence viable.

2924 2018-01-06 18:08:55 I'd wager there's a massive health difference between 'Crisco' and a fat/oil that doesn't need to be made in a factory.

2926 2018-01-06 18:08:43 This affects CITGO OIL which is a supplier of heating oil to low income people.
2927 2018-01-06 18:08:36 Does anyone use a spray bottle for their cooking oil?  Looking to get one, but some aren't recommended for rapeseed oil and that's what I use.  Needs to be light and easy to fill and spray. Please RT.  Thanks!
2928 2018-01-06 18:08:35 If you search the BBC good food website they do ‘make overs’ of popular yet unhealthy meals. think bananas and rapeseed oil were used as substitutes for some of the fats/sugar. Can’t rem if it was flapjack & what quantities were swapped. Starting point?
2929 2018-01-06 18:08:17 Look into young living essential oils! Oregano oil and thieves kicked my cold out in less than 36 hours!
2930 2018-01-06 18:08:10 I know. Few years ago the greenpeace vessel 'Arctic sunrise' went to Eemshaven and it bunkered 120.000 liters fossel fuel. Just came back of a campagne to end oil drilling somewhere. Stange world isn't it!?
2931 2018-01-06 18:08:08 policy prescriptions and achieves the same purpose - holding the companies financially responsible for the clean up. That is unless the true ambition of the tax was to punish businesses we only tolerate but do not care for (like big oil) and simultaneously profit. 
2932 2018-01-06 18:07:52 i’m using sugar and coconut oil, i’m boutta see what that’s hitting on
2933 2018-01-06 18:07:51 Actually it’s billions. Has been since the early 70’s when the Al Yamamah project began. An income stream (paid in oil), that governments both Labour and Tory, wouldn’t dream of turning off.
2934 2018-01-06 18:07:49 @guardianeco Norway court just decided constitution's environment clause not violated by plans to develop far north oil fields. This case is an important and unfortunate setback in global effort to use courts to protect the environment and deserves Guardian coverage!
2935 2018-01-06 18:07:47 i’ve tried the oil control & the long lasting one they’re both good 
2936 2018-01-06 18:07:47 Go longer between retwisting. Use jbco and coconut oil. If the thinning is really bad you can opt to combine but I really suggest babying your hair. Keep her covered in this cold (cold makes our hair brittle) and spritz ya hair with water. Water gives locs life.

2942 2018-01-06 18:07:15 Because it hasn't used up ALL the Oil and Gas yet.
2943 2018-01-06 18:07:14 It's like marbled paper (that uses oil and ink but similar principle)
2944 2018-01-06 18:07:06 ...and Judas is still number one. You need to ask your club owner to dig more oil.
2945 2018-01-06 18:07:05 That Shea  mositure coconut oil do my face so well in this cold , a must buy from target
2946 2018-01-06 18:07:03 Also tea tree oil literally works wonders. After cleaning it apply tea tree oil on it with a cotton swab. It made my nose ring infection go away after six days

2949 2018-01-06 18:06:33 The regime runs the country according to the Uganda oil and gas calendar. Once they knew that the oil won't be out by 2020 they extended their term of office for another two years. This is a business guys, nothing else. It is one's oil, not Ugandans.
2950 2018-01-06 18:06:16 To me the Oil market is the most interesting market of 2007/2008.  After a multi month pause, oil went vertical until fall /08,  then collapsed.  Late cycle even applied there.
2951 2018-01-06 18:06:15 The shame of a nation. How many oil producing nations come to buy refined petroleum products from us?
2952 2018-01-06 18:06:10 I have that problem with cooking oil

2954 2018-01-06 18:05:45 There is no difference between her and a 19th century snake oil salesman, except people finally became educated about snake oil. Anyone who gives up their "first fruits" to a well-heeled grifter deserves what they get.
2955 2018-01-06 18:05:41 This waffle batter recipe I'm using calls for "½ veg oil"
2956 2018-01-06 18:05:35 Look... if Pratt and Evans want to wrestle over who had he best season between the Seahawks and the Patriots and they trip into a supply of body oil, I’m not going to interfere.
2957 2018-01-06 18:05:26 The U.S. is rolling back transparency rules in the bribe-prone oil industry
2958 2018-01-06 18:05:22 I hate the smell of fry oil

2960 2018-01-06 18:05:15 Mate these things take time and we are heading in the right direction. We haven’t got the luxury of oil rich owners so can’t go out throwing money around like city and Chelsea did. We are in great shape and I think this sale will help the club massively with future transfers.
2961 2018-01-06 18:05:14 The “eat less meat” statement also said idle your car less which by the dumb logic of it all should mean that the oil industry was also derided? Could conservatives please at least be consistent in their idiotic rhetoric.

Oil of Okay
2967 2018-01-06 18:04:45 I refuse those.  They don't work any better than a combo of OTC and rubbing something minty like Peppermint oil or tiger balm.
2968 2018-01-06 18:04:42 Some human productions need carbon or gas.Don't all.Gas and oil are be able to produce in crops. Human current rate is not able to mantain.

2970 2018-01-06 18:04:32 Extra virgin olive oil because all these other oils been around the block. 
2971 2018-01-06 18:04:31 Ouch. Is it as expensive as it is  stateside? It works, and all, but I cannot imagine the cost. I'm in a 125+ y/o house. That offers its own issues. Heat is oil. And it is a killer in terms of cost. Not as bad as propane or electric, but close.

2976 2018-01-06 18:04:13 What Dubai Model buddy? the only reason these Muslim states are rich is the oil their ground.its not like they did anything special. lol
2977 2018-01-06 18:04:02 It's very easy. Just put oatmeal in a blender then when it reaches a good consistency just throw it in the tub. You can even add lavender oil or some sea salt. Or if u don't wanna go thru the trouble Aveeno sells good packaged ones u can throw in
2978 2018-01-06 18:03:56 yeah its just kinda annoying! you should probably put a little bit of oil (not olive oil) on a regular baking tray and put it on that. olive oil has too low a smoke point for this kinda situation
2979 2018-01-06 18:03:50 Make them feel at home and stone them or whip them, you know whatever barbaric crap they do to their own citizens that wouldn't have been allowed to continue to do if they didn't have oil America wanted.

2982 2018-01-06 18:03:09 I was not offering it as history, but as a suggestion of an alternative to a poor policy that punished responsible businesses with a tax for events that may have happened. Clearly, the tax does not prevent oil spills or the negligence that leads to them. It simply levies/1
2983 2018-01-06 18:02:43 @Izod @Indy500Blog Then everyone who loves horses and supports the Indy 500 or uses Lucas Oil should know what Forrest Lucas stands for.

2985 2018-01-06 18:02:32 Which is why I keep repeating that the revenue from Oil isn't what it appears at all: it's linked into *every* industry in varying degrees.
It's an "enabler" resource, the most diverse resource on the planet.
Nothing comes close, even some versatile plants, like hemp.

2988 2018-01-06 18:02:18 Whish is already owned by- The International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds- So trademarked to them? This could be an expense mistake -a trade mark provides a product or organisation with an identity which cannot be imitated by others

3005 2018-01-06 18:00:48 Gotta love when they resort to just making up false dichotomies.  Taxing oil companies 9 cents per barrel does not equal poor people freezing to death.  We can find a better balance between low cost fuel and environmental responsibility than making them mutually exclusive.

3015 2018-01-06 18:00:00 Lmfaooo that oil money
3016 2018-01-06 17:59:43 How about they put a MASSIVE state tax on any offshore drilling? / any oil that transits via ports in their states that is a product of offshore drilling? That would mean to avoid, drillers would have to ship an insane distance bc whole west coast off limits

3032 2018-01-06 17:57:48 Trumplethinskin Administration learned nothing from BP oil spill and now cancel oil rig safety regs. It’s a question of WHEN, not IF, the next oil spill will occur. 
3033 2018-01-06 17:57:45 What can California do to stop off shore drilling? We have to stop it!  No more New Horizon oil spills!

3043 2018-01-06 17:56:44 Oil was first discovered on the the east coast in 1851 yes 1851 - In 1975 Jim Callaghan the Labour PM flogged off right to US for pennies in the barrel, of course Thatcher demonstrated the difference between Tory and Labour - none whatsoever, both snouts in the trough
3044 2018-01-06 17:56:43 Ugh - the tired platitudes, propaganda, & fiction of the "new" GOP. Cheating lying denying. The ends justify the means: Gorsuch, MORE tax cuts.

3051 2018-01-06 17:56:13 Well what I can tell you is that the oil business has afforded my kids to go to college debt free, my house, my vacations and no longer having to work 80 a week to afford to live. So if opening up drilling in fla means I have to drive to port of Tampa vs the airport I'm all in

3056 2018-01-06 17:55:32 But our president is a reflection of who we are as a people. After all, we elect him.  Our national outlook has been superficial for decades. We could be oil independent, but Reagan double downed on oil. Hell Obama drilled more than ever. We could have a lightening fast
3057 2018-01-06 17:55:32 I cannot handle the amount of stress I feel submitting my first job application. Of course, I'm also me, so I'm doing this at a dealership while I get an oil change and a tire rotation..
3058 2018-01-06 17:55:30 The Swamp is akin to bringing your luxury car for service, the dealer wants you to feel stupid for questioning a $500 oil change. Napkins.
3059 2018-01-06 17:55:30 If Republicans want to replace funds lost to tax cuts, here's a CONSERVATIVE way to do it: charge half of market value of all oil, gas, minerals, water, or anything else extracted from public lands.  If it was their private property, they would charge us out the ass for it.
3060 2018-01-06 17:55:22 What is carrot oil used for
3061 2018-01-06 17:55:14 Want to burn the midnight oil but oil so expensive currently so naaaahhh
3062 2018-01-06 17:55:11 I'll risk a " advise the oil not too agree to free booze, smokes, drugs and energetic peculiar attention"
oh, and free chips, especially with a choice of sauce "
3063 2018-01-06 17:54:55 Goks mens biore abis make oil buster muka gue jdi lbh sger trus bebas minyak tiap hari @IDmensbiore
3064 2018-01-06 17:54:52 As long as Fremont can handle production they will breach 250K and be in US top 10 best selling cars. US trade balance will improve a lot. More cars exported and less oil imported and then more oil exported.
3065 2018-01-06 17:54:51 어케어케,,, 얼른 유튜브에 화성의 비밀 이런거 쳐서 보세요(???????????
3066 2018-01-06 17:54:43 Car wash and oil change to start off this beautiful day!
3067 2018-01-06 17:54:34 Oh I can be sure that he would. And he'd prefer a chianti bath instead of oil baths.
3068 2018-01-06 17:54:32 You bastard Europeans enjoy bomb blasting at your  airports when you support islamic republic in Iran for oil and profits
3069 2018-01-06 17:54:31 Sir our target must be to maximize on daily basis use of electric engine to save oil imports.
3070 2018-01-06 17:54:26 Woke up this morning to my German Shep eating my bottle of mink oil in the kitchen I feel it girlie
3071 2018-01-06 17:54:22 I use coconut oil on the body and hair. Always have. But it doesn't work for my face skin, it's comedogenic and my skin reacts.
3072 2018-01-06 17:54:16 Gotta go get an oil change soon....
3073 2018-01-06 17:54:00 YES. straight oil is all that works
3074 2018-01-06 17:53:56 헉 모야 롱님 왜 지금 일어나셔써요
3075 2018-01-06 17:53:54 LMAO!!!
3076 2018-01-06 17:53:51 Hahaha yuk
3077 2018-01-06 17:53:49 I am glad that you used the broad description of Russian collusion and not include meddling in the election. Based on your history of deflective denial, it means some sort if collusion exists. I am thinking oil price manipulation among other issues.
3078 2018-01-06 17:53:36 Ohhh you think someone wants to do an oil painting of the spare room book hoarding area?! 
3079 2018-01-06 17:53:32 This heating season has been so crazy. It hasn’t been this cold in so long, and everyone has been running out of oil and propane 
3080 2018-01-06 17:53:13 Round how much for tea tree oil?
3081 2018-01-06 17:53:12 Pipelines protesters are actually extremely hypocritical. Que & Ont buy tanker oil from countries with much worse Enviro records like Venezuela’s killer dictator & Saudi Sheiks etc. 47 died in Que in a rail oil explosion (N Dakota oil) & they protestoil.
3082 2018-01-06 17:53:06 Coconut oil, rosewater, black soap & witch hazel 
3083 2018-01-06 17:53:06 People in his home state know the real @EPAScottPruitt to be a criminal and corrupt politician, who takes bribe money from the oil and gas industry for his personal gain. Allowing him to be the USAG would be a huge blow to justice across this great land.
3084 2018-01-06 17:52:52 @PetroHome 
I've been on hold for more than 30 minutes trying to get her up to tell her that my oil tank is on E. I am beside myself. I'm listening to a recording on how great your services which makes it even more frustrating. I am elderly and I live alone

3086 2018-01-06 17:52:36 @Sutcliffegal Hi, my Mum has a Lester Sutcliffe oil painting and I’m trying to find out more info about him, do you know of any info sources? Thanks!
3087 2018-01-06 17:52:05 My go to make up look this week has been applying the same eyeshadow every single day, hating it, then leaving the greasy red remnants of what I shittily removed with coconut oil
3088 2018-01-06 17:51:52 Looks like I have to start practicing for a couple Snake Oil gigs... Lyrics to learn... lyrics to learn... 1/22 & 3/12 in New Haven at Cafe Nine, if anyone's round those parts...
3089 2018-01-06 17:51:41 Why are oil changes like $57 now they used to be $19.99 back in the day
3090 2018-01-06 17:51:31 sejak berapa bulan ini walopun spf an aja aku oil cleanser + facewash sih beneran jadi tambah banyak ritualnya =___________=
3091 2018-01-06 17:51:31 If we can get 3 very good players I am very happy. That’s how you build a WC squad and team without oil money. BTW: until last year I wasn’t to happy with FSG, but I think they get a lot of grief whilst operating like 99% of other owners.
3092 2018-01-06 17:51:07 But how did we get to this point: The Fact That N800 Billion is Being Owned To Oil Marketers?

Hasn't @BudgITng echoed this corruption (so to say) for a long time?
3093 2018-01-06 17:51:07 But all ten do that, yet half run out of oil before the bridegroom comes.
3094 2018-01-06 17:51:04 I dont understand how I have dry patches in my head .  I oil my scalp all the time . Got me scratching like I have lice or some.
3095 2018-01-06 17:50:59 ANOTHER METHOD IS OIL AS A WAY TO SEE IF THAT SPECIFIC MARKET IS EMERGING.I CAN PICK MORE INDUSTRIES FROM THAT SPECIFIC LOCATION FROM AN EMERGING MARKET OF OIL.DOES NOT HAVE TO BE OIL STOCK.
3096 2018-01-06 17:50:58 起きてたーwww明日休みなのをいいことにHDにたまった番組を消化していました…
3097 2018-01-06 17:50:55 Well they protest in US also , no one is 100% satisfied this is human condition...in oil rich saudi eastern region people are poor while najd prosper ....there is problem everywhere in US too there are poor people who doesnt want US to spend trillions on unnecessary war
3098 2018-01-06 17:50:48 I'm on pregablin and I take CBD oil which has helped
3099 2018-01-06 17:50:38 I meant to type of oil 

I have a little bit of oil
3100 2018-01-06 17:50:35 waiting for my oil to get changed and I scrolled all the way to the bottom of Twitter - aka this is taking too goddamn long
3101 2018-01-06 17:50:34 追ｽｹｳﾞｪありがとうございます頑張ってください！！
3102 2018-01-06 17:50:33 LSADNFKWJKEFN IS THIS ACTUALLY OIL ON CANVAS
3103 2018-01-06 17:50:28 Warm Olive oil in the ear but google it first
3104 2018-01-06 17:50:21 Nah, if you were smart you wouldn't be working for a traveling snake oil selling media outlet such as CNN
3105 2018-01-06 17:50:07 Another #GrumpsGarage exclusive, Castrol Motor Oil Pin-Up Girl. And more pin-up signage among the dozens of new.  #OneOfAKind #HotRod #Rockabilly #SoCal
3106 2018-01-06 17:50:05 Just witnessed a Pakistani buying a jar of 'raw virgin coconut oil' I have informed the police!
3107 2018-01-06 17:50:03 Hi Kev, you missed me. 
3108 2018-01-06 17:49:59 The guy who always changes my oil was so fascinated by the bullet in my car lol. “That shit wasn’t here last time. Hold up let me post this”
3109 2018-01-06 17:49:56 who decided to make her first appointment for an oil change on a Saturday morning? 
3110 2018-01-06 17:49:38 More North American oil means less need for Middle East oil - that's a good thing.
3111 2018-01-06 17:49:35 As much as City is mocked at for using oil money, at least they look like they're gonna win things
3112 2018-01-06 17:49:27 Coal, gas, and oil is best
3113 2018-01-06 17:49:17 I’m tweeting it into existence that imma be healthy 2018. I’ve got tea tree oil, Elderberry extract, silver, iodine, vitamins, green tea, a dry brush, lymphatic massage, the whole nine yards
3114 2018-01-06 17:49:16 I think the worst part of adult hood is paying for your own oil change..... #dadhelp
3115 2018-01-06 17:49:14 Pointing at #LNG and pipeline exports to Mexico misses the mark, especially for our friends in NY, CT, MA, RI, VT, NH, ME. If they don’t wake up and allow new pipelines from Marcellus then they’re going to continue to pay thru the nose (and burn fuel oil/coal) during cold snaps.
3116 2018-01-06 17:49:09 coconut oil is magiccc 
3117 2018-01-06 17:49:04 This is not the party you signed up for, and the present GOP HATES your "Yankee" State. It wants to destroy your State's resources for profit, and doesn't care if it destroys your fishing industry as long as Big Oil profits.
3118 2018-01-06 17:49:01 Not really. It's pretty lightly flavored, though it does have a taste. Try it for frying potatoes, it's kinda classic there. Sesame oil seems like something I should try!
3119 2018-01-06 17:49:01 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。

3121 2018-01-06 17:48:37 I just deipped hot oil over my hand by accident and i want to die
3122 2018-01-06 17:48:33 @realDonaldTrump Since we are going to open all these offshore oil rigs, we need the best scientists in the world to come together to make them environmentally safe. We can't have any more disasters and oil spills. Let's do this right Mr. President. Too much at stake besides oil.
3123 2018-01-06 17:48:28 Come work in oil and gas.  No industry puts a higher value on worker safety and its one of the highest paid with very few union jobs.
3124 2018-01-06 17:48:17 Since when?

Dawn detergent was used on animals, a very manual process.

Deepwater Horizon left a oil pool in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico
3125 2018-01-06 17:48:09 This is ideal for lightning chittas.
3126 2018-01-06 17:48:00 Are they having cod liver oil?
3127 2018-01-06 17:47:35 Now, we know all Socialist Dems are Liars and Theives. They have no truth to stand on. FYI, your arguement are frad like fossils and without the energy of oil,coal and Nat gas. Lots of Wind  and very little energyMAGA NEW YEAR and Energy Freedom
3128 2018-01-06 17:47:33 tRumps decisions affect our entire Planet-which everyone has a right to protest.   Like allowing North Pacific oil drilling on previously preserved land; selling off our National Parks to corporations to destroy; & removing regulations that control Environmental Protection.
3129 2018-01-06 17:47:18 And everyone’s else, including respected oil folk !!!
3130 2018-01-06 17:47:17  Im getting an oil change then doing 11-8 so it worked out lol #prospering 
3131 2018-01-06 17:47:10 No love. I spray with water first and then apply the oil&Shea butter respectively
3132 2018-01-06 17:46:49 This club says it cannot compete with the oil rich clubs yet its two most valuable assets are on the verge on leaving for free.  It defies logic. Wenger has turned us into the most irrational club in world football.
3133 2018-01-06 17:46:30 Tahun ini harus bisa jadi yang dilirik hahahaha
3134 2018-01-06 17:46:30 I like the express service center at @PattyPeckHonda. Not thrilled about having my oil life indicator reset when I was there for tire rotation/balancing.
3135 2018-01-06 17:46:25 What? But I thought every Aussie loved Midnight Oil? Do you even come from a land down under?
3136 2018-01-06 17:46:11 หิวแค่ไหนก็แดกไม่ได้ อยู่บ้านไม่เหมือน ม เด้อ จะไปหาของในตู้แดกก็จะโดนด่า อดทน 
3137 2018-01-06 17:46:07 Avocado toast gets a step up when you add a drizzle of olive oil and lemon zest 
3138 2018-01-06 17:45:57 2 C of olive oil seems excessive?? I can't wait to try them- maybe when the temp outside is on the + side!
3139 2018-01-06 17:45:46 I have some basalm oil that I'm soaking them in over night (the guy in the shop says to). Tbf this is after 4 days of walking 5 miles to and from work so it could be sooo much worse. My feet will get a day off tomorrow!
3140 2018-01-06 17:45:39 On a scale of 1-10, how millenial was your morning? Mine was a solid 8. Breakfast: boujee coffee with coconut oil, organic eggs, and half an avocado. I then quietly mourned the absence of a podcast, "smart" technology, Obamacare, the impact from climate change, and Harry Potter.
3141 2018-01-06 17:45:36 I use Mielle Organics or these Jamaican castor oil. Ima send a pic
3142 2018-01-06 17:45:25 Been slipping on my oil pulling and it’s showing I need to get my teeth back how they were
3143 2018-01-06 17:45:21 Don’t you think you should have thought about this when you turned your back on Americans. Now you just have to wait for the oil leak!
3144 2018-01-06 17:45:20 My lips have been crusty bc I’ve slacked on oiling them. So I did a lip scrub last night and let rose hip oil sit on my lips all night. They finally feel back to normal
3145 2018-01-06 17:45:01 Why tf do we need more oil and gas. Fuck the oil and gas, shit I'll fucking ride a horse if I can't a car. I'll go back to the old days, just to keep our waters from getting any worse than it already is.
3146 2018-01-06 17:44:59 When your doctor says you need to start taking fish oil pills because you're "getting older"
3147 2018-01-06 17:44:50 I’ll take two bottles of your snake oil. Did you say it cures all ails?
3148 2018-01-06 17:44:50 I mostly used it at night and used a heavy oil or body butter during the day.
3149 2018-01-06 17:44:45 They are disgusting. I don't need 2 cloves of garlic in a little plastic bag or a miniature bottle of olive oil.
3150 2018-01-06 17:44:41 誰じゃゴルァァァァ！！！！
3151 2018-01-06 17:44:39 A little I would say. Looks to me as if it's sprayed alot of oil from every part of the engine.
3152 2018-01-06 17:44:34 Hate to go to pep boys. I’ve been sleep since I got off this morning my phone been on silent babe texted talkin bout you late Nigga they gone change this oil when I get over there. Fuck that
3153 2018-01-06 17:44:04 Ooo thanks. Hadn't heard about the tea tree oil part.
3154 2018-01-06 17:43:54 My dad- " you need a boyfriend to check your oil for you so I don't have to "
3155 2018-01-06 17:43:51 I got vegetable oil.
3156 2018-01-06 17:43:44 Forgive me god for inhave sinned wkwkkwkwkkw
3157 2018-01-06 17:43:38 Crushed by the oil industry.
3158 2018-01-06 17:43:36 I use water and seal moisture with castor oil and shea butter
3159 2018-01-06 17:43:31 Spent the morning running to different gas stations to get oil for my car, which for some reason was like 2.5 quarts low.
3160 2018-01-06 17:43:25 Yes i mix it with a drop of trea tea oil and ACV and keep it on my face for 20 mins   Then put a hot towel over my face to get it off
3161 2018-01-06 17:43:23 During the day I have Vaseline or Palmers oil.
3162 2018-01-06 17:43:16 Check your Engine oil this morning.

3167 2018-01-06 17:42:48 coconut oil
3168 2018-01-06 17:42:46 No...what we need is a sincere drive toward alternative sources of fuel and a path away from fossil fuels.  Otherwise you’re gonna have oil rigs on a barren wasteland, a dead planet, and nowhere to drive.
3169 2018-01-06 17:42:45 TBH, this is the dumbest I've read (no hard feelings)

3171 2018-01-06 17:42:36 I would acquire Z stacks, automated processing. Measuring in 2D using projections probably good enough if co-loc is rare, but 3D more careful either way. Accounting for chromatic shift important. In a standard sample with a 60x oil obj and 2048x2048 sCMOS ~3-6 hrs of imaging
3172 2018-01-06 17:42:30 y’all shoulda seen my confused ass come up to the dealership to get my oil change 
3173 2018-01-06 17:42:26 Waiting on oil changes<<
3174 2018-01-06 17:42:17 Oil change for the car is done  after a 2 hour wait.....
3175 2018-01-06 17:42:16 Jordan took my car this morning and got a oil change, cleaned it out and filled my tank. That’s my fucking bae
3176 2018-01-06 17:42:10 A shotski but each glass is full of CBD oil
3177 2018-01-06 17:42:09 I need to get this oil changed but dont feel like driving to VA. 
3178 2018-01-06 17:42:03 Bertaubatlah kak. Hahaha
3179 2018-01-06 17:42:03 Sooo, when it's cold it's climate crisis and when it's hot it's climate crisis? And the only way to fix it is to buy carbon credits from you and your buddies? Also use the force of government to shut down your competitors in the oil and gas industries, correct? No thanks!
3180 2018-01-06 17:41:41 Getting an oil change
3181 2018-01-06 17:41:36 Yes, I remember - I think it was just gas in 1965 - took another few years to find oil in any quantities.
Not saying my memory is that reliable.......
But I do remember Thatcher squandering it.
3182 2018-01-06 17:41:36 The pipeline and the oil field are two entirely different things
3183 2018-01-06 17:41:35 No oil til Monday so Landlord says keep the heat on 68. that’s polar weather. I keep it on 78...I’m finna die. 
3184 2018-01-06 17:41:33 Pity because around 8 years ago thats all city used to play. Fans should remember what their team used to be before being aided by a rich oil consortium from the Middle East.
3185 2018-01-06 17:41:31 My neighbour has just knocked and brought me food, drink and..... Frankincense oil.

Just because that's what we do 
#LoveWhereILive
3186 2018-01-06 17:41:16 I TOOK A SIP OF WHAT I THOUGHT WAS COUGH SYRUP BUT IT WAS ESSENTIAL OIL
3187 2018-01-06 17:41:16 This one na crude oil.
3188 2018-01-06 17:41:05 Aing somehow pollow dia. Dan aing kecewa sama diri aing sendiri
3189 2018-01-06 17:40:59 We start by telling the neighbour blasting his stereo late at night to turn the shitty Midnight Oil songs off
3190 2018-01-06 17:40:53 The point is that while it's kosher and it's Israeli-made, it is a bit of a leap to say this numptiness is against Jews. If it were olive oil from a Druze village in Galilee being defaced, would you say it was against Jews? Never conflate Israel and Jews (as per IHRA)
3191 2018-01-06 17:40:50 Sorry, it’s hard to tell sarcasm on Twitter sometimes  Can you imagine Gaultois populated by townie hipsters? Once the supply of skinny jeans & beard oil ran out there’d be anarchy.
3192 2018-01-06 17:40:40 Tired of paying for gas, getting oil changes, etc.
3193 2018-01-06 17:40:40 昭和の戦後の負傷兵ホント見たい
3194 2018-01-06 17:40:31 While you guys are laughing at liberals I'm laughing at the fact that you guys took a bottle of Listerine, slapped a Superblue label on it and started charging people three times as much plus shipping- classic snake oil salesmanship at it's finest people @RealAlexJones #eviltoxin
3195 2018-01-06 17:40:24 Sure, smoking weed is likely the least good way to consume it. But there are a myriad of other options including vaping oil and edibles.

No need to throw the baby out with the bath water...
3196 2018-01-06 17:40:13 I can’t believe I almost passed away in my car after getting my oil change. So much smoke and it was blowing inside my car in the heat fans. So scary. Can’t stop coughing. Get it together @DeltaSonicWash.  Please say they didn’t break my car.
3197 2018-01-06 17:40:09 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
3198 2018-01-06 17:39:58 You know how much money he could make working for oil companies? Ask a republican.
3199 2018-01-06 17:39:54 If you put oil ontop then water is wet

3203 2018-01-06 17:39:48 Pretty sure the oil change guy was just kissing that girl in my truck at least he's gettin something 
3204 2018-01-06 17:39:38 Let’s just stay dependent on other countries for oil. That’s the Democratic way!
3205 2018-01-06 17:39:32 This thread started with information relating to oil reserves in Scottish waters and while I know that fracking is used in the North Sea, my post was to show that differences in taxation systems produce different results from the North Sea. How does your point sit in this thread?
3206 2018-01-06 17:39:21 Did you know Trump’s new door opening to oil drilling around the coasts of America will all go to China, money made to Tillerson’s Exxon/Mobile and spills to the tax-payer.
3207 2018-01-06 17:39:17 i was so nervous when i got pulled over i gave the cop an oil change receipt when he asked for my registration

3209 2018-01-06 17:39:12 Veterans I respect:
Ones who were drafted
Ones who had nowhere else to go
Veterans I don't respect:
Upper-middle class white boys who decided it would be fun to kill innocents in the Middle East so we can steal their oil
3210 2018-01-06 17:38:56 In R.I. we bury it...  anyways, maybe putting solar back in the Administration's generation mix and giving tax cuts for that is better than taking away fees in Tax Bill that oil companies had to pay to clean up their messes! Also, advocating for solar heating and power better!
3211 2018-01-06 17:38:40 Did they glow when lit covered in oil?
3212 2018-01-06 17:38:35 okay. kindly let me know if u are able to get. My wife is interested in making Coconut Oil too.
3213 2018-01-06 17:38:29 By selling it to big oil, big coal and corporate special interests? Sorry, not my idea of “winning”. We are losing ground to the majority of countries who are TRULY leading the way into the future. Meanwhile trump pays back corrupt special interest buddies. Remember 2008?
3214 2018-01-06 17:38:23 I do what Liz wrote daily, then once a month I use UN-follow spy. I've noticed quite a few not following back. Maybe on the next train we can include a "Follow back to remain on the train". Some of the accounts I see  following me look suspect though. Only true Patriots right.
3215 2018-01-06 17:38:21 The markets are reacting to your deregulation that now allows industry, especially oil and gas, to destroy our environment and our health. You are literally deliberately making people sick and shortening life spans with dirty air and water to give $ and power to the richest 1%.
3216 2018-01-06 17:38:16 True.  Think of the leverage many have due to oil supply.  I’m remembering the 1973 oil embargo.

3219 2018-01-06 17:38:09 You really are a lost person. Trump is going to take down United States Democracy. He’s an agent of a Foreign adversary. Wake-up. Hillary May have a rotten public personality but she wouldn’t be working with Russians. That’s why they got him elected. Oil think BIG OIL MONEY

3221 2018-01-06 17:37:46 Brady was a diamond in the rough. Goat in the 6th round is striking oil by digging in the beach. Jimmy g’s happen almost every year. He was a second rd draft pick.

3252 2018-01-06 17:35:21 Meanwhile you are encouraging unlimited immigration which requires a greater demand for oil. Liberals emotional platform creates practical hypocrisy. Promote globalism which is major destroyer of the environment. Get a real platform and quit manipulating your puppets with nonsens
3253 2018-01-06 17:35:19 GOP=lying thieves...stealing from middle/poor Americans to give to wealthy donors, stealing from the environment to give to big oil/gas companies, stealing from consumers and giving to Wall Street/big banks. If you voted GOP, you did this!!!

GOP, RAPING AMERICA AND THE PLANET!!
3254 2018-01-06 17:35:18 My car is in the shop getting an oil change 
3255 2018-01-06 17:35:04 Will people fuck off with the FSG bashing. I don't particularly like them either but I'll take them any day over a corrupt oligarch, blood-stained oil money, or the Glazers. Coutinho forced the move. Looks like they've done a good deal. Club still in a very healthy position.

3261 2018-01-06 17:34:43 Trade deals are the smartest thing and best long term good Erdogan is doing on behalf of Turkey — it is not purchases as he’s been signing trade agreements wherever he can. Buying olive oil is interesting considering Turkey’s enormous olive production.

3275 2018-01-06 17:33:15 Do you ever have a cogent thought? Exploration technology has improved immeasurably in 40 years. More oil naturally “spills” into the ocean daily than in any accidental oil spill in history.
3276 2018-01-06 17:33:07 Olbas oil & bath! I can't breathe

3278 2018-01-06 17:33:02 I dont know - Iraq war for oil.  Clinton (Bill) a criminal.  Bush stole election. Doesn't seem like anything new is going on with respect to delegitimizing the opposition.

3291 2018-01-06 17:31:41 Big government is the historically proven solution.  It brought Standard Oil to heel and it can bring Walmart, Monsanto, McDonald's and others to heel.  True patriots and the US government don't need their permission if they want to survive and thrive in America.

3302 2018-01-06 17:30:42 It is not an act of genius to ENDANGER THE ENTIRE COASTAL REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES by “giving away” those regions to commercial entities for oil drilling. Is so called mar a lago going to have a drilling rig directly in front of it also?

3324 2018-01-06 17:28:13 All right, very well, but it's kind of weird to think the inadequate memory about the past, and the consequent inability to learn the lessons from the past oil spills remain a problem. It's a huge pity. It's vital that we do not fail to learn from the painful lessons learned.
3325 2018-01-06 17:28:09 Thank you..
3326 2018-01-06 17:28:06 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.

3333 2018-01-06 17:27:31 And from what I read, snuck into the #TaxScam is a provision for oil companies, they no longer will be required

3340 2018-01-06 17:27:00 This thread has done nothing but disturb me. 

Although I do admit I do occasionally enjoy a smidge of hydraulic oil fed to me from a dusty funnel.

3342 2018-01-06 17:26:45 I might take my Mitsubishi Evo IV engine block, crankshaft and girdle to the machine shop next week to have them drill holes for the oil squirters and do a general check to see if everything seems ok before re-assembly. 
3343 2018-01-06 17:26:42 I want an oil diffuser. Thanks for the chance @LAINDIA928

3347 2018-01-07 23:59:26 the POINT is, that using oil to MAKE oil is wasteful, not to mention dirty ... we were discussing whether the grid can handle the extra load EV's may cause and the answer is yes it can ... why waste oil making oil when you can just use renewables for a CLEANER grid

3350 2018-01-07 23:58:57 The topical oils are what are known as CBD-it doesn't make you high, but is used as a topical for pain. Since legalization here in Oregon, there are a couple of restaurants that cook with an infused cooking oil. Haven't tried it, but it's out there.

3378 2018-01-07 23:56:14 Ugh Amazon get your oil diffuser results out of my humidifier search.
3379 2018-01-07 23:56:08 I make an extra “special” version with coconut oil I’ll let you know next time
3380 2018-01-07 23:55:46 What oil?!
3381 2018-01-07 23:55:45 Or you can use almond oil too! It’s usually like $3
3382 2018-01-07 23:55:37 I could see that. I used one in my bath called deep blue and it was great. Also made a run with coconut oil with it and lavender for J after cheer.
3383 2018-01-07 23:55:33 I don't own a gun.  Then again I don't look as good as that in that dress.  But this is hysterical.
3384 2018-01-07 23:55:29 Get ready for the blue wave chuck. No one is buying the Trump snake oil pitch. He is and will be the worst president of the United States. Have fun speaking at these “sold out” events though. It’s worst than a rodan and fields pyramid scheme.
3385 2018-01-07 23:55:23 wow...are they stealing the oil money?
3386 2018-01-07 23:54:46 I leather myself in coconut oil! Two times a day, 7 days a week  not sure about ya face tho?! Heard it’s good but a bit oily for yer face isn’t  it? You should try vanishing cream from Lush it’s amazzzzzzing 
3387 2018-01-07 23:54:35 Oil & water. I think you're the oil & I'm the water. Messily mixing until we separate.
3388 2018-01-07 23:54:35 One need only to read the profile of @FriendsOScience to determine their credibility. Friends of Oil, Friends of Denial, Friends of Ignorance. Move along people, nothing to see here!
3389 2018-01-07 23:54:30 Oil paint is literally the best paint ever created
3390 2018-01-07 23:54:24 OIL is EVIL. The oceans and seas are polluted. Greedy Devils care more about their wealth than about our planet.
3391 2018-01-07 23:54:23 2018: Oil IS the new data

3398 2018-01-07 23:53:50 He had 2 part episode on French fries this summer and how much worse they are now bc everyone switched from animal fat grease to palm oil
3399 2018-01-07 23:53:46 Coconut oil, almond milk, cinnamon, dash of cloves, splash of honey or maple syrup.
3400 2018-01-07 23:53:20 I'mma need my Mediterranean white family to stop saying shit like "Italians/Greeks/Sicilians aren't white." 
They are white they just make better food.
Olive oil ass crackers.
3401 2018-01-07 23:52:53 I would accomplish a lot more if two Texas oil billionaires bet on aspects of my life
3402 2018-01-07 23:52:38 Interesting. I heard oil of oregano is good in a bath for sore muscles.
3403 2018-01-07 23:52:29 Is this the only song that this lady knows?? Her country is as good as bankrupt, even if they received all the oil revenues, (after paying off infrastructure debt and investers)  they still wouldn't cover there health care and hospital funding!
3404 2018-01-07 23:52:28 Coconut oil is my jam!
3405 2018-01-07 23:52:25 It’s for sure not the injuries .Just a really bad transition team .The D doesn’t have the skill set to move the puck as a whole
3406 2018-01-07 23:52:20 kinda like the oil company executives standing behind Notley when it came to carbon tax implimentation, then they left the country to save their millions
3407 2018-01-07 23:52:12 You are a fraud, a sham, a scam, a con artist, a huckster, a snake oil salesman a pathological lying narcissist. Sad
3408 2018-01-07 23:52:11 so like if it says it’s essential oil is that okay?
3409 2018-01-07 23:52:09 As soon as Trump and Zinke open up offshore drilling I’m going to drill for oil well within sight of Mar-A-Lago.
3410 2018-01-07 23:52:08 
3411 2018-01-07 23:52:07 I only spend $$ on leave-in conditioners & styling products. Head & Shoulders shampoo and Aussie Moist Conditioner. Oil from the BSS. Camille Rose Naturals for styling.
3412 2018-01-07 23:52:03 "you were the squeaky wheel, so you got all the oil"
3413 2018-01-07 23:51:59 @RX931 #5YearsAgo ayoko pa ng amoy ng efficascent oil..
3414 2018-01-07 23:51:57 In New Mexico, there are very stark cultural differences between Hispanic northern corridor and southeastern ranching/oil patch, which is more Texan.  On top of Albuquerque-vs-everyone else divide.
3415 2018-01-07 23:51:27 over benefit? in Iran with that much oil ppl got no benefits, let alone disability benefits or access point to the important building. i wish we had gov like u,that's our dream.u dont know what u have,be greatful, mulla shoot disable ppl who got injured in war if they ask for sup
3416 2018-01-07 23:51:12 1972- Earth Sci prof at Ill St. Univ told us the Earth was warming due to "pollution from coal & oil." This wasn't "political" until ethanol started cutting into your sales.
3417 2018-01-07 23:50:42 doesn't it resemble the deals they make with oil cos? Cash loan backed by potential production? If you can't receive oil how do you take this? Sounds like lucrative biz for middle men  I'm sure that ecosystem will arise
3418 2018-01-07 23:50:29 "I want an oil diffuser"
3419 2018-01-07 23:50:06 Black walnut oil works miracles

(Translation: Eat it, smoke it, use it as a topical oil..  Edibles are very popular. )
3421 2018-01-07 23:50:00 Random thought... for 8 years there was coconut oil regularly stocked and used in the White House once upon a time.
3422 2018-01-07 23:49:54 my sound machine and essential oil humidifier are actually therapeutic and i highly recommend both
3423 2018-01-07 23:49:46 Just did a micro-dose of magic mushrooms, 15mg of cbd oil, and now I'm heading to a 6 hour yoga, meditation, and sound bath  #livingmybestlife
3424 2018-01-07 23:49:26 Liquid Wrench?  Penetrating oil.  Just apply some, maybe give it a couple raps with a hammer, and let it sit overnight.
3425 2018-01-07 23:49:23 I'm donating oil(from my face). Anyone interested? Pm sis
3426 2018-01-07 23:49:21 And got an oil massage, what’s hannin
3427 2018-01-07 23:49:19 Because oil is dying there won't be enough eventually to sustain the need. With better battery technology growing you'll have self driving electric vehicles all over. You want to drink and drive? Take the Tesla and it'll self drive you to and from the bar etc.
3428 2018-01-07 23:49:17 need oil
3429 2018-01-07 23:49:15 this argument is nonsensical ... they are using one source of dirty fuel to make another unusable dirty fuel usable? All they are doing is making more pollution to make more dirty oil ... electricity from renewables removes ALL of that

3435 2018-01-07 23:48:13 Be careful what you wish for.  Possible he wants an excuse to go in if there is oil or other resources.
3436 2018-01-07 23:48:10 I didn't like him from the moment I saw him. I knew right away he was selling snake oil.
3437 2018-01-07 23:48:07 Froze to death doing it, but Orpheus has fresh blood. First time I've successfully changed my own oil so I can officially call myself a car person now
3438 2018-01-07 23:48:05 Don’t you love being able to laugh twice as long now? Me too!!!!
3439 2018-01-07 23:47:43 yeah, I had to go a couple days sober bc I got my wisdom teeth removed and I haven’t needed to use ever since. I had a bit of sativa oil at a birthday party last night but other than that I’ve been effortlessly sober.
3440 2018-01-07 23:47:42 Words can't explain how grateful I am for the hot oil treatment I put in my hair last night. I've been out in the cold all day and my hair is still soft.

3448 2018-01-07 23:46:36 @AlloccaMirella i think you asked what oils I used. DoTerra. For colds I take oil of oregano, lime, lemon. 2 drops each in a shot glass of water.
3449 2018-01-07 23:46:29 Here Comes The Sunflower Oil #MakeAsongMiddleClass
3450 2018-01-07 23:46:13 People who overuse oil on their skin don’t know that they can clog their pores. Especially if a pah you face. Especially if you don’t exfoliate.
3451 2018-01-07 23:46:07 #DBIX ... VERY LOW supply and EXTREMELY undervalued. They are bringing Blockchain to DUBAI .  New Arab exchange is opening soon and the oil industry is planning on injecting massive money into this. Look for 10-15x Any day now.
3452 2018-01-07 23:45:54 Why is South Korea buying oil from Iran? A state that supports it's enemy to the north.
3453 2018-01-07 23:45:48 That was gold! I have to say I occasionally like a full-service station, especially for an older car that burns oil, whatever. And, yeah, that winter thing? They have a point about that.
3454 2018-01-07 23:45:42 America wants the oil supply
3455 2018-01-07 23:45:39 Same for me! They have peppermint oil in them so that may be why they work so well.
3456 2018-01-07 23:45:16 Castor oil every night girl!!! I found some at Walmart!
3457 2018-01-07 23:45:07 Casey keeps turning off my oil diffuser because the scents are “overwhelming”...BRUH don’t get me a diffuser for Christmas unless you want our apt. to smell like cedar wood all year round!! 
3458 2018-01-07 23:44:58 just a guess. i mean, women couldn't wear stockings bc the material was needed for military purposes. and if the varnishes were oil based, there was a lot of rationing on that too.
3459 2018-01-07 23:44:55 I even managed a pint in your gaff before home.  Thankfully the Neck Oil not being on downstairs kept it to one.
3460 2018-01-07 23:44:51 Used some baking soda & essential oil to clean my washer & it is absolutely tragic how happy I am about how good it smells
3461 2018-01-07 23:44:22 I know someone ask me to delete it... I can it’s no biggie
3462 2018-01-07 23:44:15 Thank you for recommending Peppermint Halo Eileen! We like to roll this cooling essential oil blend along the hairline and on the back of the neck for ultimate relief, Faiza.
3463 2018-01-07 23:44:11 Last time my dog pulled one of those vet told me to put a little olive oil in her water to clean out her system.. and man did that work. Wouldn’t recommend inside the house...... 
3464 2018-01-07 23:43:50 Yep. I struggle to see how the oil backing can be credible, given that most of Venezuela's oil is mortgaged to the Chinese.
3465 2018-01-07 23:43:40 Perhaps you should not have emboldened this president with your misguided and damaging tax plan vote.  Your complaining now about oil and gas drilling off the Maine coast is laughable. You have not stood with the people.
3466 2018-01-07 23:43:10 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
3467 2018-01-07 23:43:10 The jersey devil ain't gon' be able to despise Olive Oil like that fucking ghost will.
3468 2018-01-07 23:43:08 ทำไมร้าย
3469 2018-01-07 23:43:02 Me nah talk bout if it work or nuh work lol too much can clog pores and weigh your hair down....Just like any other oil. Gweh wid you 160 well moisturized locs.

3471 2018-01-07 23:42:50 My feet hurt again. Q_Q I'm gonna make curry buns though, anyways. I do not want to deep fry it though, because hot oil scares me. Gonna attempt the oven instead.
3472 2018-01-07 23:42:50 Manufacturing jobs WILL return to the USA because devaluation of our currency will allow exports to be cheaper for foreign buyers. I saw this in Ecuador where they exported oil when the country had a shortage. They couldn’t afford to buy their own oil.
3473 2018-01-07 23:42:28 At least he can use our fallen limbs to bang on oil drums and rib cages or whatever

3475 2018-01-07 23:42:19 NO comparison lady!  It is like night and day, oil and water, Iran and USA are two differnent worlds! 99% of USA Police are the very best, verses 99% Iran police total nightmare.
3476 2018-01-07 23:42:10 THE OIL CHANGE WAS WHIPPING THE BEATING'S ASS
3477 2018-01-07 23:41:57 "But you love me all the same," he wiggled his ass as much as he could. Once he felt the warm oil being rubbed in with his his arms, he let out a breath of relief.
3478 2018-01-07 23:41:45 I forgot to tweet this earlier, however I want everyone to know how ignorant char is. homegirl, tried to make funnel cake in a frying pan like a pancake, instead of frying it in oil. 
3479 2018-01-07 23:41:37 Everyone...  Regardless of political party...  Has had the same foreign policy for decades.  Bomb countries that no longer want to trade oil with the US dollar.  That is the bottom line.
3480 2018-01-07 23:41:37 Put brand new luggage on a @SouthwestAir flight and what do you get back? A bag that literally looks run over and is covered in motor oil. Response you get from SW employees? “It happens” #SoHelpful
3481 2018-01-07 23:41:33 Of course he doesn't want trade sanctions on his country. 
Who Would?
I'm not sure what pretense Obama used to justify the sanctions but I'm certain that it's comical.
Peak Oil.
As reserves become depleted, it gets more valuable, e/o wants to sell others stock, and sit on theirs.
3482 2018-01-07 23:41:19 His argument is that electricity is used to refine the fuel when the truth is that refineries almost all operate using the energy in the oil they are refining to power their operations...they have little/no electricity use

3493 2018-01-07 23:40:05 Mr. President: It cost over $75 per barrel to capture oil offshore, while it costs $20 on land. Consequently, oil companies are not drilling offshore anytime soon, and those policies will be rescinded when you leave. One more instance of favoring big oil over the American people.
3494 2018-01-07 23:39:57 PSA : The dollar tree sells jars of coconut oil

3497 2018-01-07 23:39:26 My oil cartridge being broken got me upset off  what does that even mean? Who wrote that? #upsetoff
3498 2018-01-07 23:39:24 Oil and water. Hopefully you can make it through. It’s hard not to be yourself.
3499 2018-01-07 23:39:19 My girlfriend sighed very heavily and I asked her what was wrong. Her response: “I was deciding between coconut or olive oil to put in my noodles tomorrow.”

3522 2018-01-07 23:34:29 Imma have her body sweating like she was dipped in baby oil
3523 2018-01-07 23:34:24 You oppose it? So when do they start drilling? Your opposition never works out for citizens. You'll just line your pockets with more big oil money.
3524 2018-01-07 23:34:16 This weekend has me beat  I need an ice bath and a full body massage with some hot oil 
3525 2018-01-07 23:34:09 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.

3537 2018-01-07 23:33:05 Make sure they’re not too wet when they go into the oil, or it will boil over all over the floor.
3538 2018-01-07 23:33:00 Congratulations to my Junior oil Barons on their 4 point weekend.

3546 2018-01-07 23:31:40 Thank you for keeping the school librarian, proven to improve student literacy and SAT scores.  Vote out the School Board members who permitted this.  Our own school board colluded with oil company members to put oil company name on a public school;Privatization of Ed. happening
3547 2018-01-07 23:31:27 Tea tree oil has fixed most of the problems in my life. Pimples, cold sores, grades, existential crisis, its great

3550 2018-01-07 23:31:15 With the ebs trade the oil thought they were getting a younger cheaper with not as much talent but with upside vesion of ebs. It just didn't pan out  and we still grossly undersold there
3551 2018-01-07 23:31:13 people confuse that just because the label says that it’s vegan that it’s healthier, but in reality your vegan cheese is filled w chemicals, fillers, hydrogenated oil, + process sugars so u might as well eat the real thing—plant based is better cause it’s real shit
3552 2018-01-07 23:31:11 He is a snake oil salesmen who tried to sell the world this b.s. he probably doesn't believe in. I hope Tipper took him to the cleaners.
3553 2018-01-07 23:31:10 I have never disagreed with anything more than this. Do you hate truffles in general or just truffle oil?
3554 2018-01-07 23:31:00 Which one? The micellar water? Or the oil in the purple container? I got the wipes but baby oil works better for me hehe

3558 2018-01-07 23:30:29 It's like a fryer that doesn't use oil, it uses super hot air or some other science shit
3559 2018-01-07 23:30:28 Ok, I need to go and get a diffuser and some oil. Thank you so much

3577 2018-01-07 23:28:45 He wants sanctiob3s lifted, so he can have his 500 billion $$ oil deal.
3578 2018-01-07 23:28:38 Soba noodles are made with buckwheat I think. Boil and add carrot ribbons, sugar snap peas, baby sweet corn, sesame seeds and cashews. Dress with lemon juice, soy, mirin and sesame oil. 
3579 2018-01-07 23:28:37 Fantastic but if no one is scoring continuing to do the same thing is pointless. All that is great but at some point they need to score.

3591 2018-01-07 23:26:46 Have u tried IT cosmetics bye bye pores primer Kathleen? It's incredible. Nothing settles in ur pores and y look airbrushed. (That's my experience anyway). Also, Josie Maran's new moonstone drops is exceptional.  Pure argan oil, irredescent color that  makes ur Skin like silk

3602 2018-01-07 23:25:05 Vitamin e oil and rose water are doing wonders for my skin!! I’m really out here flourishing 
3603 2018-01-07 23:25:05 Mr. President: Why do you need to call people names? It is so childish to do that. Leasing out offshore land to oil companies will eventually damage the environment, hurt your constitutents, and pollute the ocean. Wrong!!

3614 2018-01-07 23:23:29 If fracking were eliminated, gas would be $15+ and oil $150+ virtually overnight.  The US$ would crater, the trade surplus would disappear, and the world would be plunged into recession.  Thank fracking for your prosperity.  It has truly changed lives for the better.

3620 2018-01-07 23:21:50 There's no reminder that I'm trapped in Canadian Ice Hell that's more annoying than perpetually smelling like I'm on a tropical vacation thanks to buying the wrong deodorant plus using coconut oil on my surgery scars during the day. Wish I was on a warm beach. D:

3632 2018-01-07 23:20:17 I think anybody blaming this mess on injuries /sickness are being truly disingenuous. Not only the Ducks but Vegas with all their goalie problems and even Vancouver too.
3633 2018-01-07 23:20:17 Well, truffle oil contains no truffles, so you're probably still safe there.
3634 2018-01-07 23:20:04 So many totally deluded carb-deprived charlatans out there, with zero to offer anyone than snake oil, disinformation and false hope. #SadIndeed
3635 2018-01-07 23:20:01 Coconut oil doesn’t absorb into the lips very well but it can act as a sealant. Put on regular lip balm, wait a few minutes and then coconut oil over top. Works best at nite.

3637 2018-01-07 23:19:44 @jaketapper Yea, right, you pulled the plug only AFTER giving this snake oil salesman soooo many minutes of air time spent castigating you & CNN. Only a fool would let this rodent play his game on your dime.
3638 2018-01-07 23:19:43 Um, no. You can't work for/with Woody "Perv" Allen and use the hashtag #TimesUp. They are mutually exclusive, like oil and water.

3640 2018-01-07 23:19:35 She said that everything smelled like tea tree oil so dang bad for so long after not dilute it.  That's stuff's strong  but is great
3641 2018-01-07 23:19:25 Showed me little brother how to refill the engine oil, check the water pump, and explained the struggles of my old car. Passing the torch to him now 
3642 2018-01-07 23:19:22 Every bit as black as crude oil from the Niger Delta! 
3643 2018-01-07 23:19:20 So I'm thinking the Oil need to make a trade. What do you think it takes to get Hall and Eberle?
3644 2018-01-07 23:19:10 No rub, just a 2:1:1:1:1 paste of oil, salt, pepper, paprika and dry mustard for sprouts and just salt, pepper and korean teriyaki on burgers. Oh and thighs marinating in peanut sauce and teriyaki

3646 2018-01-07 23:18:58 Heeeeeeeeeeeeeec yes! This past season was the first season in 3 years I didn't go to Indy bc they were so bad. . I'll def. Be there this coming season. Hyped about a new coach and luck back. The colts are 2-0 when I go to Lucas oil. 
3647 2018-01-07 23:18:49 Georgina & Betty are sleeping next to wife, Jack is asleep next to me, Tiggy is laying next to the oil rad. Peace reigns !
3648 2018-01-07 23:18:37 For instance, magnolia can’t be distilled to produce an oil that gives off a scent so when you see magnolia as a listed note in a fragrance it’s 100% synthetic. So imagine trying to “paint” something with your nose that doesn’t even exist in nature 
3649 2018-01-07 23:18:20 I have a face mask on, and my essential oil diffuser is filling the room with lavender. I'm feeling hydrated and VERY unbothered 
3650 2018-01-07 23:18:20 It's empowering.  You rock, DSR!!!  Girls can, and want to.

My dad would not let me own a car till I could do oil changes, set timing, plugs/wires.  
He had me mowing grass at ten, painting, fishing/filleting.  Chopping wood at 12.  (ok, it was on a log splitter)
3651 2018-01-07 23:18:08 Oilers with their worst game in weeks at 5v5 after loading up the top line. A top line that was outshot and outchanced.
3652 2018-01-07 23:17:53 Я просто хочу сказать что 39 красава
3653 2018-01-07 23:17:32 Какая разница если 39 красава
3654 2018-01-07 23:17:13 What the heck do you think men do? Working to support the family, bringing up kids, doing chores, fixing things, putting out the garbage, shoveling the snow, changing the oil, paying the bills, worrying  about the future. If your life sucks - don’t universalize it.
3655 2018-01-07 23:17:08 Saturated fats are also found in a few vegetable oils, such as palm oil, coconut oil, hydrogenated oils, and chocolate. #HeartHealth
3656 2018-01-07 23:16:41 I’m not gonna debate what IS or IS NOT an olive oil can with a Sicilian .... I know when I’m out of my element. 

Now back to the important stuff ... just plain buttermilk pancakes.   Don’t fruit up my flapjacks or my Whiskey.
3657 2018-01-07 23:16:37 Dilute it.  My daughter tried both way's the tea tree oil is so strong it made her eyes water but it did work
3658 2018-01-07 23:16:27 Now here is a random question: why did oil painters stopped using varnish in the 40s? I've heard more than once they did, I just have no idea why
3659 2018-01-07 23:16:23 How do people just GROW their nails? I have lived for 18 years and not once have I seen any of my nails grow 1 inch. I have tried every serum , every hardener, ever oil there is. my hands look like an 8 year old boy’s hand

3662 2018-01-07 23:15:52 ps for the non-haters a little bit of decent truffle oil added to a lemon vinaigrette (don't use straight truffle oil) works really well with a grilled salmon salad
3663 2018-01-07 23:15:32 how much tea tree oil to water ?
3664 2018-01-07 23:15:28 Try rose hip oil! It helps get rid of scars and texture while also helping w acne + it’s natural
3665 2018-01-07 23:15:16 I need an oil change
3666 2018-01-07 23:15:16 Perfect. And every oil company executive should be required to keep a family member on a deep-water oil rig....

3669 2018-01-07 23:14:35 No way, just get one goal and the Oil will fold like a cheap tent.
3670 2018-01-07 23:14:17 Most refineries use the energy of the imported oil to refine their fuels so your point is not terribly relevant
3671 2018-01-07 23:14:15 Shake hands with danger? Why, he's givin' danger a scented oil rubdown! #rifftrax #shakehandswithdanger
3672 2018-01-07 23:13:55 listen i know i have a fever and my throat is so swollen i can’t really talk but i took a hot shower and put bath oil all over my body and now my skin feels so frickin luxurious
3673 2018-01-07 23:13:52 Crude Oil for week of Jan 8, 2018:  Resistance is currently at 62.10 - 62.55.  Move above 62.55 will be a buy signal.  Support is currently at 61.45 - 61.00. Move below 61.00 will be a sell signal.  Potential reversal days are Mon, Tue, Thur.
3674 2018-01-07 23:13:50 Another game when Oilers can't score, if not for an awful goal against they should have been shutout yet again. Can't say it enough, this group has no confidence and can't get out of it.  In essence, this has become the team version of what Eberle went through in 2016-17.
3675 2018-01-07 23:13:46 Friendship and Business is like Oil and water...Immiscible. #BeWise
3676 2018-01-07 23:13:44 Our pipes are freezing every day. It’s an old, poorly insulated house and running oil constantly costs $1,000 per month which we just can’t afford. Having to use fan heaters and hope they don’t burst.
3677 2018-01-07 23:13:38 Okay for my nose piercing and the bump beside it do I use pure tea tree oil or do I dilute it ?
3678 2018-01-07 23:13:37 Ordered some CBD oil today. Should be delivered in a bit.

She: I don't worry about it, I'm not eating it.
3693 2018-01-07 23:11:34 What about oil and gas? And its role?

3712 2018-01-07 23:09:50 When oil was way up Workers in Fort Mac at Tim's were paid $22 per hour because the franchise could not hire workers for less.

3715 2018-01-07 23:09:29 Was in Vegas in Sept, got a ticket say's I put a hundred on the Oil to win the cup. Got 9/1 odds. Only thing dumber would be to put another hundred on them. But the odds are so freaking enticing now!!
3716 2018-01-07 23:09:08 Why is tea tree oil stinging on my face

3719 2018-01-07 23:08:35 Bake a few pieces of chicken breasts. Cover the meat in oil and massage some pepper, salt and paprika into the meat. Bake for about 25 minutes at 400°. The paprika gives you then spicy ness of fried chicken. But it's much healthier

3721 2018-01-07 23:08:21 100% which is why I said the Russell turnover was costly. Not blaming him per say but it started the whole sequence. As I said after the second Chicago goal...when it rains it pours. Not good.
3722 2018-01-07 23:08:20 That’s not a paint thinner can. That’s more olive oil or castor oil. 

Blueberry? Chocolate Chip? Or Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity?
3723 2018-01-07 23:08:18 Do the oil, eggs, etc. fast make more sense in the context, then?
3724 2018-01-07 23:08:12 Are they planning oil rigs for Ocean City?
3725 2018-01-07 23:08:02 Chicken based good protein levels plus ash and oil Plenty of options and not necessarily expensive avoid red meat based products due to risk of colitis .Very high protein levels whilst he’s growing then as an adult working dog around 23% bit less in summer when hes not working
3726 2018-01-07 23:07:57 As an owner operator truck driver I want cheaper oil
3727 2018-01-07 23:07:46 Same same same same sameeee. I switched to an oil scrub this week. And I think I gotta get a humidifier.

3734 2018-01-07 23:07:29 You talk about the mythology as ironclad, and this mythology is faaaar from ironclad perfect. So faar from it, it has reinvented completely; at least what we are shown. There will be no answers for the organometallic hybrids, nor the bees nor the Black Oil.
3735 2018-01-07 23:07:25 If corn oil is made of corn and vegetable oil is made of vegatables then wtf is baby oil made out of...
3736 2018-01-07 23:07:23 That cannabis oil ain’t no joke
3737 2018-01-07 23:07:08 I was going to say "Well, you can listen to the radio/music you want." but then realized your car has to be off in order to change the oil. You can run it via battery, but who wants to drain their battery during an oil change? "Oh, we changed your oil but you killed your car!"
3738 2018-01-07 23:07:07 What about truffle shuffle oil?
3739 2018-01-07 23:07:00 IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP CIVILIANS SAFE IN COUNTRIES WITH OIL that the US would go to war with to "grab their oil" (Trump's words), Syria is a good example and it looks like Myanmar could be next.
3740 2018-01-07 23:06:50 Actually it’s not a joke. She’s on CBD oil and it’s been amazing for her arthritis. We’re actually using the marijuana based so we have to buy it from a pot shop (my husband has a medical license), but they sell hemp based at some pet stores & online. It’s really great.
3741 2018-01-07 23:06:48 Also Kesler
3742 2018-01-07 23:06:47 We changed the oil on my car and discovered that she didn’t have a lot because I can’t get the plug on right enough to where she won’t leak lmao
3743 2018-01-07 23:06:46 The gov't can encourage it via incentives. The energy of tomorrow is not coal or oil. The choose to incite fossil fuel because that's who comprises their major donors.
3744 2018-01-07 23:06:45 McDavid might be able to fetch them Matt Hendricks back from the Jets. Oil might have to throw in a pick, too.
3745 2018-01-07 23:06:34 Right. It's very cool shape.  Do you think I could sautee it in olive oil and it would be tender?
3746 2018-01-07 23:06:31 Oil cleansing method! 
3747 2018-01-07 23:06:28 Vegan lasagna tomorrow, and then chicken breasts/red potatoes/broccoli marinated in lemon/garlic/rosemary/olive oil and roasted in a pan

3750 2018-01-07 23:06:15 Hear from this Oregonian: your posturing as part of #TheResistance makes you unable to influence decisions on legal marijuana, offshore oil drilling, tax reform, etc vital to Oregonians.
3751 2018-01-07 23:06:14 While the USA goes for broke with coal power, oil, gas, fracking & shale everywhere, power prices plummeting, we go for the virtual pedal-power option. Sacrificing Australians

3753 2018-01-07 23:06:05 It’s called connecting with ur clients. If u don’t want to, just be the ass u r and they will leave u alone.
3754 2018-01-07 23:05:58 Surely, without technological breakthrough (e.g. fracking) the cost for hydrocarbons will increase as reserves are depleted. The cost of that "last barrel of oil" will increase to the point it will never be extracted.

3761 2018-01-07 23:04:21 Not at all! I like it best combined with a rose hip oil. It makes your skin super hydrated but not oily hydrated.

3774 2018-01-07 23:02:53 Actually, had the puck not just been given away there would have likely been no pinch. Bad decision by Russell to start and made worse by Nurse.

3780 2018-01-07 23:01:55 Or rather the inability (or refusal) of his fans to see him for the snake oil salesman that he has always been.
3781 2018-01-07 23:01:33 No debating the pinch but go back just prior to it and watch what Russell does with the puck. It was a silly decision & keep back the other way mere seconds later.
3782 2018-01-07 23:01:33 Years of effort I'm afraid. Russia oil oligarchs have money. A lot of it. They've used it to for their oil-based energy agenda.
When opportunity presented, Putin mobilized those assets, exploited cracks in our democracy & we end up w/a corrupt Congress &a puppet president.
3783 2018-01-07 23:01:31 tune in to watch ancient millionaire crooks yell at clouds.

jfc.

i'd rather put my head in a vitamix filled with boiling oil.
3784 2018-01-07 23:01:04 Haha. If it helps, just because they inspired a generation doesn’t mean we can’t read more challenging books afterwards! We start with McDonalds and graduate to hipster burgers with truffle oil and kumera fries  
3785 2018-01-07 23:00:53 It’s no butter.. I thought it was too. I asked for hash browns with no butter and he said it’s only cooked with oil. That little pot they have above the grill is only has oil in it.
3786 2018-01-07 23:00:52 but...it sounds...so..gross :)
3787 2018-01-07 23:00:46 OIL DIFF: 6.34 -> 6.44
3788 2018-01-07 23:00:44 Adulting : Having to bleed the air out of your oil->furnace line because delivery was 1 hour late and ran out.
Lucky dad is still around to teach me how to do it instead of waiting until tomorrow for repair man to show.
3789 2018-01-07 23:00:43 Chinese authorities decided to restrict exports such as oil and steel to North Korea. This is valid from January 6th.
3790 2018-01-07 23:00:41 Chelsea were the original trailblazers of football financial doping. Don't sulk just because your sugar daddy is trying to wean you off the dirty oil money now.
3791 2018-01-07 23:00:14 @adamthomas21 my shar pei has a skin complaint and we use coconut oil and it’s worked a treat for her, hope u find a solution x
3792 2018-01-07 23:00:12 None of that g coconut or extra virgin olive oil I’m working with both
3793 2018-01-07 23:00:08 I'm pretty sure it is GOP and the lobbyists that want to hold on to the oil and exploit the middle class that is a major problem.
There are solutions, but this chaos without real long term strategy is going to fail, if you have any insight. Quick solutions are only temporary.
3794 2018-01-07 22:59:56 I call it the stupidity of your poor, white, Christian base and you being a lying snake oil salesman
3795 2018-01-07 22:59:31 Don't disagree with the pinch but my point is if you go back about 10 seconds prior to, Russell had possession and was driving to the net & just dumped it into the corner. No need for it.
3796 2018-01-07 22:59:28 I learned that solar energy could potentially make the process of extracting oil more environmentally friendly by limiting the amount of carbon produced  #thermalenergynews #LQchem
3797 2018-01-07 22:59:08 ... then the oil company points it's finger at the solar grid using it as proof that solar energy doesn't work. It's the same principle with healthcare in the UK.
3798 2018-01-07 22:59:04 Modern Science CERN relies computation in ye olden days you had say Millikan Oil Drop each event highly significant. Now we tease info  out of low significance info.
3799 2018-01-07 22:59:00 My coconut oil doesn’t have a smell
3800 2018-01-07 22:58:56 具体的なアドバイス？？…んなもんねぇよ！（怒
3801 2018-01-07 22:58:38 Went to a gibbon conservatory today! I bought a stuffed animal to support the efforts and also will religiously read ingredient labels for palm oil, and you should too.  can't live blind anymore, have to hear the screams.
3802 2018-01-07 22:58:35 I've come to the realization that coconut oil is actually the most effective way to remove eye makeup
3803 2018-01-07 22:58:16 This is the bowl from their menu:
Organic brown rice, tamari & olive oil, shredded carrots &  beets, braised kale, marinated baked tofu, with a cashew ginger sauce  and sesame seeds
3804 2018-01-07 22:58:12 October I had to pay my car payment, car taxes, get an oil change & get new tires..I had to go to the alter & pray that month
3805 2018-01-07 22:58:10 Goodyear, doin tires and oil changes, if I get the promotion I'd be workin up front as a service advisor making like 2 or 3 times as much as I am now
3806 2018-01-07 22:58:09 Timing the switching to and then away from PLT seems to make that regime unworkable. Pres. Mester touched on that at #ASSA2018 during her presentation. 

And then you just imagine an oil shock at the ZLB within such a switching regime...
3807 2018-01-07 22:58:00 Peppermint oil!
3808 2018-01-07 22:58:00 Meal prep this week: Pork tenderloin (2) + bacon slab (1) + olive oil + vinegar + Italian seasoning + water+ slow cooker (10 hours, low and slow).
3809 2018-01-07 22:57:59 I desperately need to get my oil changed and a car wash but I’m too afraid to go alone
3810 2018-01-07 22:57:42 Y’alls cash rents are crazy cheap. They should be in that range in our area but oil rich farmers drive that up. Hard for farmers like myself who don’t have that extra cash coming in to compete.
3811 2018-01-07 22:57:41 I have been thinking about a post petroleum future since the oil embargo of '73.
I only need a collaborator.
3812 2018-01-07 22:57:35 Imagine if an oil company were to have control over a solar energy grid without providing maintainence, which would lead to it breaking down over time....
3813 2018-01-07 22:57:29 Above 32* today, Got Blazer washed, added a lil oil, water n brake flud. Life is GOOD once again.

นอนเหงื่อไหล่มา2วันแล้ว มีฝนตกอีก 
แดดกลางวันก็โคตรร้อน 
งงใจว่าตัวเองอยู่เหนือหรืออยู่ใต้ หือ
3817 2018-01-07 22:57:01 Yeah, it sucks but I’m still loyal to the oil by all means. But I just have a funny feeling that this isn’t their year :(
3818 2018-01-07 22:56:32 No that would still be in U.S. Dollars... you need to pay attention in your finance/economic classes dawg... I'm not talking about "not trusting money in U.S. bank"... I keep my money stored in other places like #Oil $CL_F, #Gold $GC_F, #Stocks, other countries #FX, even #Crypto.
3819 2018-01-07 22:56:28 It usually depends on how dry my hair is feeling, but usually every other day i spray a leave-in conditioner all over my hair & seal my scalp w an oil.
3820 2018-01-07 22:56:17 My son was able to change the car oil almost completely by himself this time. I'm doing something right.
3821 2018-01-07 22:56:15 Y'all my cat is obsessed with coconut oil... 
3822 2018-01-07 22:56:02 Fui al festival de rosca, tamal y atole en huerto roma verde, y aunque la oferta es variada y muy rica en algunos casos, en otros no dejan de bombardear con el gluten free, sugar free, oil free, 100% vegan orgánico salvaje (no miento con este término que hoy escuché)
3823 2018-01-07 22:55:56 Yep.  This.  I feel your pain.  Basically had the same conversation as an automotive engineer and had to shake my work ID badge in someone’s face to be taken seriously.  Also had to employ this method getting an oil change, buying windshield wipers....
3824 2018-01-07 22:55:42 @greggutfeld 
So that cbd oil not containing any the is supposed to be legal in all 50 states
Well they siezed all of it in Alabama to test it to make sure
The oil was never returned 
Hmmmmmm
3825 2018-01-07 22:55:41 Absolutely loved the foreigner. Jackie chan still an absolute badass, and surely he takes cod liver oil on a daily basis as his joints have more get up and go than a Turkish salt sprinkler in his prime  #theforeigner #jackiechan
3826 2018-01-07 22:55:33 I cook like a short order cook... grilled chicken, beef tenderloin, mashed potatoes, steamed asparagus, broccoli sautéed with garlic & oil. See why I need wine tonight 
3827 2018-01-07 22:55:28 u can kneel down anywhere.... even on my head sef!
the anointing oil is on 3 days trance, moreover the Spirit of the Lord says u should kneel down for that 3days. And i'd be glad if you hearken brethren
3828 2018-01-07 22:55:16 @petrohome it has been 9 hours and still no oil...no heat after calling numerous times. 5th call today, on hold 91 minutes!!
3829 2018-01-07 22:54:54 I’m going to bed at 9 I said.
It’s currently midnight and I’m watching a video of how OLIVE OIL is made. 

What the fuck.
3830 2018-01-07 22:54:22 Amo cuando tengo el pelo súper lacio y lindo  pero odio con mi vida cuando al 2 o 3 día ya tengo un pote completo de baby oil en el pelo

3834 2018-01-07 22:53:28 yooo i used to avoid them because i just assumed they were nasty but recently been having them oven roasted w oil, seasoning and a dijon mustard maple syrup dressing and ... it’s fire can’t lie
3835 2018-01-07 22:53:21 When we had the lowest rate of min wage earners hordes of well paid oil workers commuted to Alberta & left when oil industry suffered. Min wage earners are still here. Also more businesses now pay min wage because they can get employees to work for it. In good days they couldn't.
3836 2018-01-07 22:53:11 lemme get my oil drill and ill make that happen ;)
3837 2018-01-07 22:53:11 Belleville, Ontario. Go Oil! #OilersRollCall
3838 2018-01-07 22:53:00 I just got the new cookbook! Amazing imaging we would live in a world where clean food would be sold in every restaurant. No sugar no salt no oil 
3839 2018-01-07 22:52:54 @PetroHome ..........so, I’m now without heat because you bumped me because other people ran out. Then you lie to me saying I’m getting oil today.....looking out the window with an icicle growing on my nose....not to mention my health issues make it dangerous - love my Petro!!!
3840 2018-01-07 22:52:51 I have been making chicken, baked or roasted not skin. And a lot more veggie dishes, it’s taking everything in me not to add a little pat of butter to this olive oil for these brussel sprouts.
3841 2018-01-07 22:52:31 Do the globes come filled with massage oil from sponsor Massage Envy?
3842 2018-01-07 22:52:30 Time to go see if I have frozen pizza still in the freezer because I forgot to buy a thermometer for the oil so I can't make schnitzel todayyy
3843 2018-01-07 22:52:08 that's why I saw they were changing shit cause oil won't last forever
3844 2018-01-07 22:51:41 *Dad gets into my car*
“Why is your engine, oil change, and tire pressure light on??”
3845 2018-01-07 22:51:39 Shoutout to the dude at valvoline who randomly gave me $15 off my oil change. You a real one

3852 2018-01-07 22:50:52 Because this coconut oil and shea moisturizer getting my hair rightttt
3853 2018-01-07 22:50:49 Yeah that goal from PSG was good but just emphasises how unbalanced Oil money has made domestic leagues. Hopefully it's unsustainable and they set up a European Super League
3854 2018-01-07 22:50:35 This is no different than the snake oil salesmen and patent medicines up to the early 1900’s.  The supplement/nutrition/holistic medicine world may be the most cynical and underhanded market in all of business, outside of straight up financial frauds.
3855 2018-01-07 22:50:23 Don’t throw the Dow industrial average out as anything other than the rich getting richer, go research how many Americans actually have enough $ to invest, and at what percentages. It’s staggering. And don’t feed me your trickle down crap, go sell your snake oil somewhere else.
3856 2018-01-07 22:50:11 Another nail biter by the Oil.
3857 2018-01-07 22:49:43 Is it back to the days of $100/bbl oil? Of course not but ffs a job’s a job isn’t it?

3874 2018-01-07 22:47:46 Frank Spotnitz, who has co-written lots of the mythology together with Chris Carter, has explicitly stated that the Rebels are an alien race. The same race of aliens as the ABH, only with disfigured faces, to prevent the grey aliens' life force (black oil/purity) from entering.
3875 2018-01-07 22:47:29 Girl, don’t even bother with it. It coats the fabric and makes clothes blah. Get some dryer balls and drop some essential oil on them if you want them to smell nicer. Or mix the balls and just deal with the static.
3876 2018-01-07 22:47:26 You know...food gets cold almost the instant it touches your plate. Lye water and oil mixtures stay hot FOREVER. #waitingishard
3877 2018-01-07 22:47:19 Yum yum.  Try it with some nice broiled haddock, marinated for 10 minutes in some olive oil, lemon juice and chipotle spice.
3878 2018-01-07 22:47:13 So, let's all pledge to boycott oil companies that choose to drill in the newly opened regions. And let's all pledge to write our 401(k) providers and tell them we'll switch providers unless their funds divest from said oil/exploration companies. There's a lot we can do....

3883 2018-01-07 22:46:46 I am very lazy and figured out how to mix a small portion into a single serving and microwave it on a plate sprayed with oil until done. It's not browned but it's still pretty good. Experiment!
3884 2018-01-07 22:46:39 i feel you on the peely, dry skin! i'd say try seal in your skin's moisture with products that contain a light oil, like jojoba, grapeseed, or argan oil. heavier oils like shea butter or coconut can be problematic if you get blemishes.
3885 2018-01-07 22:46:31 So normally I put in a curl enhancer, but the winter weather has been killing my whole scalp so I'm using oil only and my normal curls are actually so much better.

3896 2018-01-07 22:45:06 Natural citrus scents usually help me a lot. Like an orange essential oil - it’s small enough to carry on your bag through security. Just dab a little on the top of your hand and bring it close to your nose every once in a while. Works like a charm for me.
3897 2018-01-07 22:44:53 Fact- Carter Page spoke to Rus intelligence who also wanted to speak to the campaign fact the dossier speaks of the the Rus oil company and rosenof sale, and a 19% stake, which then happens at 19.5%. Ignorance is just listening to Hannity or whoever and not doing your homework

3910 2018-01-07 22:42:18 Honestly I basically bathe in coconut oil these days it's ridic how much I use
3911 2018-01-07 22:42:11 Yes, it's not the oil industry that's lying, it's climate scientists that are full of shit... The fact that we've been experiencing record level global temperatures isn't because of gas and coal,...so keep consuming (says gas and coal). Glad you've thought this through.

3914 2018-01-07 22:41:44 @PetroHome - run out of oil. Spend 30 minutes on hold to be told oil on the way today.  Y hours looking out the window getting colder. Call back, 38 minutes on hold to be told Noooo tomorrow for oil. Then I’m told my oil delivery was pushed back because others ran out. ......

3918 2018-01-07 22:41:11 Maybe that was a good place for him to check his oil, on a highway with cars going 80mph sounds like how a Ford guy thinks so you could be right might not have been broke down

3921 2018-01-07 22:40:44 Making donut holes and rolling them around in hot oil is oddly soothing and really fun.
3922 2018-01-07 22:40:38 We got oil today but the furnace still needs to be restarted
3923 2018-01-07 22:40:35 Have you considered adding a drop of oil to your current moisturiser? I find it helps my dry skin

3931 2018-01-07 22:39:21 How awful we had cod liver oil in capsules probably spoilt
3932 2018-01-07 22:38:57 Remember Desert Storm? On his way out of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein's forces set the Kuwaiti oil fields on fire.

We're seeing this little bit of history in the process of repeating itself.
3933 2018-01-07 22:38:49 .@iDexonic never buys oil since he could wring his hair out and have a few gallons of the stuff right then and there

3956 2018-01-07 22:35:37 I feel like if I would’ve gotten more trims, it would’ve grown a little faster, so I would try that! also, try mixing avocado & olive oil and put it in your hair overnight!! that can also work wonders if you include it in your nightly routine!!

3958 2018-01-07 22:35:35 Often times, skin over produces oil because not enough oil is being used in the skin care regimen to moisturize the skin. So it overcompensates. I can do a personalized skincare regimen for you if you need custom recommendations

3966 2018-01-07 22:34:26 Er zit een extreem corrupt verband tussen klimaatscepticisme (eigenl. Een te mooi woord) en zeer grote financiële belangen (oil industry bv.).

3968 2018-01-07 22:34:07 Thanks! My white inking pens decided to be difficult, so I had to carefully use white out. I would have gotten some oil paint from the barn, but it’s in the negatives today! Σ('◉⌓◉’)
3969 2018-01-07 22:33:44 To have followers on this inane post site means absolutely nothing to me.  So you enjoyed double digit inflation,  the oil embargo,  444 days of Americans in bondage ( Reagan fixed that in 3.5 hours), that moron giving the Panama Canal away where 5600 Americans paid the ultimate.
3970 2018-01-07 22:33:36 انت بتهرب
3971 2018-01-07 22:33:32 It’s ok to admit the Oil aren’t good enough and last year was an anomaly. Both Alberta teams are still rebuilding. That playoff push last season set some unrealistic expectations. Sorry truth hurts.
3972 2018-01-07 22:33:31 Wait it’s an oil how does that work with oily skin 
3973 2018-01-07 22:33:21 ##UKOG #BROADFORDBRIDGE well lads the race is on for a pic of on oil tanker coming out of BB.May the best man win! I'm throwing down the Gauntlett!

3980 2018-01-07 22:32:12 The video you posted is real but why can't you people go to the real fact.the fact is that northern Nigeria collaborate with shell oil company sponsored by British harmed.rule.terrorize and destroy the biafrans or Christians/jews
3981 2018-01-07 22:32:00 They're not complaining because a) they've left the province (billions and billions), and b) out of fear for repercussions from speaking out. I've had many high ranking oil and gas owners & execs tell me point blank that Notley is catastrophic for the industry
3982 2018-01-07 22:31:56 I think oil is peaking. I turned bullish of oil two years ago at $27 & had a $60 target. That move is over & I expect it to head to lower lows. Also bearish on the equity market. EURUSD can get to 1.28 without the help of either oil or the equity markets.
3983 2018-01-07 22:31:55 @ellanicolawills  Rosie’s lipsticks I highly recommend they have Argan oil and Shea butter  xx
3984 2018-01-07 22:31:46 Gold is like the dos kernel in Windows 10. No one thinks it's relevant anymore but it drives the whole system & needs plenty of oil 2 keep it greased.
3985 2018-01-07 22:31:31 Very sad. Could have been avoided if our $26B in oil $$$ was prudently managed as opposed to blown!
3986 2018-01-07 22:31:21 “Star Wars Holiday Special” was the divergence point.   In 1977 in the correct timeline, Lucas didn’t smoke that spiked joint, never green lighted it, OPEC collapsed, there was no oil crisis, and the world experienced a new dawn. (1/2)
3987 2018-01-07 22:31:15 Just got to know that major oil marketers are not selling into Jerry cans. How do they expect pple to use gens? Jeez!!!

3995 2018-01-07 22:30:20 DONALD has been very swift in getting regulations and rules to protect our water air we breath and the ground we call earth removed giving large companies and large polluters a free hand and much less responsibility for their pollution he is creating more oil drilling

4002 2018-01-07 22:29:50 It's true. During the Cold War, every American movie villain was Russian. Around the 1990's they changed to Middle Eastern to Garner public support  of military intervention (The documentary Blood and Oil shows this)
4003 2018-01-07 22:29:48 Sad thing is Iran is just aprt of the plan.  Next Somalia then SOUTH PAKISTAN.  Not rocket science.  Control the oil.
4004 2018-01-07 22:29:44 Just bought a diffuser and essential oil

4006 2018-01-07 22:29:31 Yes. Oil producers loose cash if people look for alternatives to automobility. At least 2 sovereign oil wealth funds are propping Uber up.

4009 2018-01-07 22:28:59 Man, maybe it’s just me but the ppl thinking chiarelli is going to get fired sound a lot like the ppl who think the oil are going to make the playoffs to me.

I sure hope I’m wrong in disagreeing with them but I can’t see it happening.
4010 2018-01-07 22:28:55 I love that fucking Valvoline Oil Change radio commercial where it's like..

Valvoline Guy:  We give you the luxury of waiting IN your car while we work on it!
Some Lady:  What? But at the other oil change places, they make me wait in a waiting room!

Why is that a selling point?
4011 2018-01-07 22:28:55 Baby no tears wash works good and for smell mist with a oil and essential oil mix with water not too heavy just a little will go a long way

4013 2018-01-07 22:28:43 I take cod liver oil and vit C+zinc if immune system is feeling low. Worth keeping an eye on your iron levels as well if you're vegetarian and do a lot of running.
4014 2018-01-07 22:28:34 lmao I just remembered one time when I was making carrot cake and didn't have oil so I used olive oil. My mom told me to check if I had all the ingredients beforehand and I was like "I CHECKED" (she already knew there wasn't oil). But I win because it still turned out great
4015 2018-01-07 22:28:22 I live in Midland, TX, heart of oil country, tons of people here work in oil/gas industry. There’s one dude I see driving around town in a Tesla with vanity plate of “THX ELON”. I’m honestly surprised nobody has keyed it yet.

4017 2018-01-07 22:28:18 I never understood that it’s a great point my only thought is I would say 75 percent of people in college are liberals or have liberal views and you know that’s like oil and water
4018 2018-01-07 22:28:05 Layoffs are happening at Carrier, AT&T, all major retail outlets (especially K-Mart, Sears & Macy's), DirecTV, GoPro, Allergan & other Pharmas & PBS-short list.

4032 2018-01-07 22:26:18 i heard castor oil
4033 2018-01-07 22:26:11 Some, and I believe Israel is foremost among them, want nothing more than for Syria to be broken up and destabilised. Assad's oft-stated aim to restore every inch of Syrian sovereign land runs counter to those extracting oil from the Golan, for example.

4039 2018-01-07 22:25:13 @PetroHome ... Overwhelmed and grossly under-prepared. Customers with no oil/heat/hot water for more than 48 hours and you essentially go silent with phones out and canned social media responses. #fail #longisland

4041 2018-01-07 22:25:03 You can try using butter and see if you like the flavor and texture better. It is all about how you want to serve and eat them. We like them atop the bread so the oil is balanced with the bread.

4044 2018-01-07 22:24:32 how could democrats also allow this vital tax to lapse? Are congressional dems relying on states to fight the oil and gas cos. alone?
4045 2018-01-07 22:24:24 1cup of coconut oil mixed with 20 drops each of tea tree, lavender, rosemary and copaiba essential oils: this should be enough for 6-7 applications.  Apply to your hair and leave for 20 minuted before shampooing out

4053 2018-01-07 22:23:45 Really, from where did it come from? (When the earth was created there was only so much gold, silver, oil and natural gas created as well.)
Please explain the “increased  supply.”
4054 2018-01-07 22:23:41 I looked cross-eyed at a brussels sprout recipe that called for 5 tbs olive oil, but it really does need it & it works.
4055 2018-01-07 22:23:36 They did have some oil in their lamps, since their lamps were going out around midnight. They just didn’t have enough supply to last until the bridegroom came. I think the reason they didn’t have enough is they assumed he’d come earlier and thought they were good.

4065 2018-01-07 22:21:23 @Walmart I would really appreciate someone helping about a recent visit to your auto center. I was supposed to receive an eGift Card for the oil change, and have not.

4076 2018-01-07 22:20:14 You do understand the concept of ecosystem right? Youninderstand the terms resource utilisation and “peak” anything (oil/ has/ agriculture).
4077 2018-01-07 22:20:10 RT @LivingSafely: Haven't changed your vehicle's oil since September? Why not make an appointment at the garage today!
4078 2018-01-07 22:20:09 Tried doing a hot oil treatment from lush but I made it too watery and now it’s dripping all over me send help

二日間ありがとうございました
4083 2018-01-07 22:19:44 My Nina gave me this peppermint essential oil yesterday for my migraines, and my god it’s magic in a bottle.
4084 2018-01-07 22:19:43 I think I've finally managed to wash the baby oil out of my makeup brushes 3 days later, whoever said use baby oil is stoopid 
4085 2018-01-07 22:19:24 I have sensitive dry skin and I swear by tarte Maracuja oil
4086 2018-01-07 22:19:22 Stop listening to Kenney’s lying garbage. Fear mongering falsehoods. Why aren’t big business and any oil companies complaining? Only right wing politicians complaining.
4087 2018-01-07 22:19:19 I can balance a checkbook, sew a button on, check the oil in my vehicle, change a flat (slow but can do it), check air pressure in tires, count change back (Yes it's a dying art form), follow a recipe, create my own meals, and do laundry!!!   1/2
4088 2018-01-07 22:19:15 And yes, you're right, Dave. You could win congressional seats on the pot issue alone in those states, but the Dems are wholly uninterested; they are in Big Pharma's pocket as GOP is in Big Oil's

4090 2018-01-07 22:19:11 I’m about to start changing my own oil. I don’t know who these places think they are charging an arm and a leg for an oil change and tire rotation 
4091 2018-01-07 22:19:10 "Oil dey your head". Lol
4092 2018-01-07 22:19:09 Ya boi changed his oil today and got half of it in his hair
4093 2018-01-07 22:18:56 あと一時間くらいか
4094 2018-01-07 22:18:56 Absolutely. I work in flavors and getting natural sourced chemicals can be exceptionally $$ if it’s fished out of a complex mix like an essential oil or botanical.
4095 2018-01-07 22:18:54 1 small can of tuna in oil, with the oil (olive or sunflower)
1 T spoon of mayo & 1 of BBQ sauce
1 slice of bread, diced
1 pinch of sea salt
the top end of some asparagus
all in 2 wraps
4096 2018-01-07 22:18:51 At least today is 26F and not -10 would have sucked cause gotta change oil in my mom's car
4097 2018-01-07 22:18:46 I’m the winter I switch all my water based products to oil based ones

4100 2018-01-07 22:18:13 Can he stay in it his whole career? I’d like to see him changing my oil next week
4101 2018-01-07 22:17:58 9static bearings in 90 weight gear oil don't like cold weather.
4102 2018-01-07 22:17:53 Air fryers are so awesome. We got one from Best Buy for like 50$ cooks things so awesome without the grease and oil.
4103 2018-01-07 22:17:48 Hemp is an extremely efficient crop with so many uses. Paper, clothes, oil, medicine etc. Grows fast even in poor soil and has a massive yield/area. Oh, and very little waste. Hard to beat 
4104 2018-01-07 22:17:46 I spilled coconut oil on my side of the bedroom a couple months ago and when I'm walking in socks, I'm still just about wiping out
4105 2018-01-07 22:17:46 Carrie Gracie is the daughter of a Scottish oil executive so you just know she went to a private school. Of course she needs a pay rise, not working class women cleaning the offices. #BBCNews
4106 2018-01-07 22:17:42 coconut oil is my f.r.i.e.n.d.
4107 2018-01-07 22:17:31 Rachel Notley’s NDP is a far better supporter of AB business and our oil industry than ANY past PC govt. Best govt since Lougheed. Tell me one single thing Kenney plans that would help AB citizens!
4108 2018-01-07 22:17:31 @KHayhoe I figured out the real reason Christians are against climate science. Oil companies corrupted the meaning of the bible by emphasizing subdue the earth propaganda. Now, to be Christian you have to want to destroy all life on earth. Weird, but true.
4109 2018-01-07 22:17:21 Luckily Tyrod Taylor will be changing oil after this game
4110 2018-01-07 22:17:11 Oh ouch with the bleeding :x why oil on the white hair? 
I sometimes apply a bit of 'Ojon' brand oil because it stops my hair being frizzy.

I also found a hair mask in Body Shop that smells like those banana sweets and I am so happy.
4111 2018-01-07 22:17:06 Get the oil out I'll see you in the morning
4112 2018-01-07 22:17:04 The Oilers just oil.
4113 2018-01-07 22:17:00 Absurd!!! You are supporting destroying our planet for big oil!
4114 2018-01-07 22:16:50 Called to get my oil tank filled yesterday.  I was told they are backed up until Monday Jan 15th.  I can make it until then because I also have 3 wood stoves but what about people who can't?  Anyone else have trouble getting oil?
4115 2018-01-07 22:16:25 Sprinkle lavender oil on your pillow and you will sleep amazingly trust
4116 2018-01-07 22:16:14 President Trump is not mentally unfit, the democrats liberal left that try to push their UNGODLY lying agenda on the weak minded and minions of socialism and whatever makes me feel good people are! Cats and dogs don’t sleep together oil and water don’t mix, these are the unfit!!!
4117 2018-01-07 22:16:11 Your logic makes sense David, if you assume a higher Oil price on greater economic activity, the Euro rises to keep Euro based energy costs muted to the full extent of the squeeze on economic performance.
4118 2018-01-07 22:15:52 Hey,who are your replacement for Oil and Sanchez? @Arsenal
4119 2018-01-07 22:15:36 Compare this to the Exxon Valdez which spilled 41,000 cubic meters which is about 32.800 tonnes of oil
4120 2018-01-07 22:15:28 i’ve been using aloe vera gel and tea tree oil mixed together every night and it’s been slowly fading for me! :’)
4121 2018-01-07 22:15:27 Yes, Democrats do fear a successful Trump presidency: Community programs cut, public education crippled, EPA gutted, green energy progress stifled, water and land permanently ruined by more oil drilling and the already wealthy getting the biggest tax breaks.
4122 2018-01-07 22:15:15 someone bring me valve oil pls
4123 2018-01-07 22:15:10 my oil diffuser is the best thing thats ever happened to me.
4124 2018-01-07 22:14:57 Pomade! Definitely pomade! A heavy oil based one, and a hair stylist obvs. Even in war!
4125 2018-01-07 22:14:49 I put too much eucalyptus essential oil in my diffuser and now my apartment smells like a spa. Spa Vrai.
4126 2018-01-07 22:14:42 Hemp oil is your pal. Coconut oil is super comedogenic. x
4127 2018-01-07 22:14:36 are they sure he wasn't the Burger King oil drinker?
4128 2018-01-07 22:14:31 Simple oil of cloves...
4129 2018-01-07 22:14:24 coconut oil is my favorite
4130 2018-01-07 22:14:10 No local inflation numbers in there?
Did prices go up?
We are seeing prices go up on Oil Changes, served coffee in Ontario. (My experiences this week, both blamed on higher #MinWage)
4131 2018-01-07 22:13:54 I just started CBD oil and it's helping with my anxiety, sleep and pain.
4132 2018-01-07 22:13:53 Witch hazel!! Preferably alcohol free if ur skin dries out quickly and Rose hip oil helps moisturize and helps w redness from pimples/scars also I use a clay mask mixed w apple cider vinegar and it clears up my face sooooo fast
4133 2018-01-07 22:13:37 And  punish ur baby oil and soaps? Neeeeh
4134 2018-01-07 22:13:25 @miss_akpene Jamaican black castor oil
4135 2018-01-07 22:13:23 When you forget to take of your badge and walk in to get an oil change...everyone will start talking to you about their BP 
4136 2018-01-07 22:13:20 Reason why top Republicans may be against Mueller - a Putin-linked billionaire who made his fortune off Russian oil.  gave Senator Graham’s super PAC $800,000, McConnell $2.5M, Rubio $1.5M, Scott Walker $1.1M, Kasich $250K & McCain $200K-
4137 2018-01-07 22:13:11 It’s actually £700M spent on players but don’t let the truth get in the way of a good agenda. 

If you don’t have oil or drug money unfortunately you have to find other ways to compete. Until we find our magical owner that ticks all boxes this is how it is.

4139 2018-01-07 22:13:04 More oil is good for the US.
4140 2018-01-07 22:12:47 Peppermint oil worked wonders on my headache 
4141 2018-01-07 22:12:44 next kitchen purchase: either oil free air fryer or instant pot
4142 2018-01-07 22:12:38 ..NAH.. china embarrassed by oil transfer pics.. thought USA would keep it QT .. have prodded their puppet prez in SKorea 2 begin talks 2 try & embarrass prezDJT .. expect Skorea 2 make some outlandish agreement with NKorea .. china owns SKorean prez ..
4143 2018-01-07 22:12:19 We disobeyed quite a lot over the centuries. Popular uprisings are historically commonplace but we always seem to get screwed by snake oil salesmen. Especially since 1992. You're probably right, we're hard-wired that way or at least most of us. Panes et circenses...
4144 2018-01-07 22:12:03 *breaks. Learn to read, then try writing.
4145 2018-01-07 22:12:03 our house runs on heating oil (which is code for "diesel too dirty to run in trucks" which i did not know) so this is appealing. i'm gonna call for an audit. $2k is much cheaper than geothermal
4146 2018-01-07 22:11:57 So I’ve fallen in love with oil pastel drawings / paintings .
4147 2018-01-07 22:11:51 Hope he’s got factor 6 olive oil on !
4148 2018-01-07 22:11:41 Adios @realmadrid #laliga é do @FCBarcelona
4149 2018-01-07 22:11:37 Heck. Oil companies will use that as an excuse to raise gas prices.
4150 2018-01-07 22:11:24 Beans also. My mom eats beans a bunch of different ways. Or she'll eat soups she's made. Coconut cream, almond milk, that stuff. Coconut oil not butter. Etc. Fruits!
4151 2018-01-07 22:11:14 ❧  Engoule Jaunet  ❧

For marital complaints. Eat it solemnly.

● 6 chopped lilac sprigges
● sap of blue root
● a bit of onyx
● some oil of vitriol
● 2 minced boletes

The smell is obscene.

May cause or cure plague.
4152 2018-01-07 22:11:14 Bonnie and Clyde, starring Zoe Saldana and Elisabeth Shue. Directed by Martin Scorsese, music by Midnight Oil. Budget: $20m
4153 2018-01-07 22:11:14 Those who would give up essential Chili oil, to purchase a little temporary American-style wheat wine ale, deserve neither Goji berry nor Shortcake.
4154 2018-01-07 22:11:09 If so, why did Turkey send them weapons and medical help? Why did they buy oil from them?
4155 2018-01-07 22:10:56 You don’t mean that surely? Fuck the traditions of the club, n sell us to the highest bidder with shady oil money to be used as an Oligarks play thing. I’d rather get relegated. We’re better than that. FAR better.
4156 2018-01-07 22:10:54 All I want is a subway flatbread club with lettuce tomato  mayonnaise cucumbers pickles oil and vinegar and some pussy that’s it
4157 2018-01-07 22:10:53 Now I've stopped that completely, so I need to stick lots of oil on the white hair which, again, oil, but carefully.
4158 2018-01-07 22:10:45 I mean how do OIL TANKERS colliede...I mean how exactly can that happen? Are they travelling at Ramming Speed these days or something?
4159 2018-01-07 22:10:28 Or... Doug is thankful to have a job, actually enjoys it, and realizes that there's life after the oil patch/making bank isn't everything.
4160 2018-01-07 22:10:19 Saudis are busy filling the pockets of US government( buying arms for war on Yemen, & squandering billions on palaces around the world, following Israeli agenda towards Iran,and oil paintings for hundreds of millions $$$
4161 2018-01-07 22:10:17 Unfortunately Canadian track record (mining and oil) globally is not any better but hopefully we can all work to change all that.

4164 2018-01-07 22:09:45 I seasoned the shrimp w/ salt n pepper then let sit in fridge. 
While the pasta cooked I heated the olive oil then sautéed the red pepper w/ the garlic (and onion if you have it) then added the sauce after 3-4 minutes. Add the shrimp until cooked throughly then tomato & spinach.
4165 2018-01-07 22:09:04 my family is known for miles under the eyes so I don't know what are moles coming in and what is black heads and I'm NOT  consistent with the wipes and oil...and I have pcos.
4166 2018-01-07 22:08:59 Underage? But he could go serve and die for his country’s oil interests in the Middle East. Where are the gun advocates and NRA supporters?
4167 2018-01-07 22:08:52 This hot oil treatment makes me smell like i just walked out of a deep fryer
4168 2018-01-07 22:08:44 Richard is scared that domestic investors have replaced foreign investors in Alberta oil patch assets. 

He thinks it’s bad. 

At least I think that’s what it is. 

Also, he’s intimidated by economists. I think.

4170 2018-01-07 22:08:40 This hot oil treatment I put in my hair last night gave my roots life Again!
4171 2018-01-07 22:08:17 Finally uninstalled @Avira snake oil from my computer. Really no need for it and their ad wrt to Spectre CPU bug just shows how little they apparently understand. Antivirus software doesn't protect against that attack vector.
4172 2018-01-07 22:07:54 The major oil companies are in favour of carbon pricing, and say it is needed to stay competitive internationally.  So why are Kenney and friends so against it?
4173 2018-01-07 22:07:51 PSG and City with their oil money taking the game further away from reality. Sad state of affairs .. no one footballer worth that money in one week in my opinion. You could pay for 1,000’s of nurses for that
4174 2018-01-07 22:07:48 They HV a lot way to go in their pursuit of oil exploration and discovery
4175 2018-01-07 22:07:41 While Friday was an obvious day of profit taking.  Q4s are now only 1-month away, I think alot of people will be woken up and we might see some big money return to the sector.  $TCW posted 300% yoy growth;  imagine what happens when they raise their rates as oil $ increases?
4176 2018-01-07 22:07:36 That was the sickest moment I had ever seen with HRC.  Of all the things I have heard come from her mouth that was the most appalling. People need to know Gaddafi was suppose to get a humanitarian award that year. He was working with Chavez on taking out oil corruption.
4177 2018-01-07 22:07:26 #TGHaven | You lay out a banquet before me that my oppressors can see. You rub my head with oil and my cup is full. Ps 23:5 #Bible
4178 2018-01-07 22:07:24 Does Vida have a steam room?  That could help with your cold. Especially if they use eucalyptus oil in the steam.
4179 2018-01-07 22:07:16 my mom got coconut oil to cook with but she’s gonna be pissed when she finds out i’ve been using it for my hair lmao
4180 2018-01-07 22:07:10 I got the oil in my box and I’m obsessed
4181 2018-01-07 22:07:08 Lord help them. Alaska still has issues with oil just under the beach rocks and blobs of it rolling around on ocean floor killing everything
4182 2018-01-07 22:07:06 That's fucked up it took alaska forever to recover from that oil spill
4183 2018-01-07 22:07:05 Ha ha well I was thinking that, they have real orange oil in them, so surely that counts! 
4184 2018-01-07 22:07:03 My room smells like a mixture of lavender and jojoba oil and I'm feeling it

4186 2018-01-07 22:06:33 I cleanse with an oil balm to get me makeup off, then go in with that Corsx Good Morning Low PH cleanser and it doesn't make my parched face feel like it's made of scrunched tin foil. I used to use Cetaphil hydrating which is p. good too!
4187 2018-01-07 22:06:18 Why would OPEC allow prices of Oil to go up and revitalize Shale? Not sure. Stranger things have happened.
4188 2018-01-07 22:05:54 Same! My skin is a loooot softer too I’ve noticed. I also mix tea tree oil w water and rub that along my spots too
4189 2018-01-07 22:05:53 Attack me...no biggie. Attack my kids...you’re done. Peddle your SNAKE OIL elsewhere. Better still, hike with HILLARY in the woods. 
4190 2018-01-07 22:05:48 It has been a major succeed in fairness. A huge success. For the right wing, corporations, the KKK and other assorted white supremacist groups, big oil, ancient fuel like coal, dodgy evangelical groups, fascism, 1950s values and thinking, racism and hate. Huge, huge success.

4203 2018-01-07 22:02:58 The reason why the GOP, corporate america, Big Oil, Wall Street, etc. put up with @realDonaldTrump ? The man who started out the NY threatening N.Korea with red button? Because they get Tax Cuts in exchange for caressing/kissing ass of the #stablegenius Trump's ego.
4204 2018-01-07 22:02:34 *COLD PRESSED* COCONUT  OIL ALL OVER MY FACE & COATING MY ENTIRE HAIR & SCALP. VERY EXCITED FOR THIS NO SHAMPOO + NO CONDITIONER LIFESTYLE. 
4205 2018-01-07 22:02:30 I remember the dread of the sound of a home heating oil truck coming down the a MA ostreet. Trying to calculate how much money I had to warm a house vs eat. Moved to Texas, done.
4206 2018-01-07 22:02:29 Soon the oil companies will be rewarded each time they pollute. Just like Bizarreo Earth.
4207 2018-01-07 22:02:28 I would argue that market distortion on the supply side is something state intervention whether through subsidies ( which artificially lower prices increasing demand) or through lobbied monopolistic endeavors ( ISP's, oil) most definitely contributes too at the same time it takes
4208 2018-01-07 22:02:28 that is ok but what is not high lighted is our oil revenue get wasted in supporting the war in Syria war in Yemen to support Houthis Hezbollah in Lebanon this supports  draining the countries wealth IRANIAN people should come first charity start at home
4209 2018-01-07 22:02:27 Pray that their beard oil works wonders for me
4210 2018-01-07 22:02:22 that was oil, for mah 8-pack!
4211 2018-01-07 22:02:09 I need 2 more people that want a big discount on cbd oil. It is 53.00 per bottle
4212 2018-01-07 22:01:56 Nice chart. This $EBY will go on a bullish run this week. Strong bids and oil prices are on the rise. I'm going to enjoy the ride.

4215 2018-01-07 22:01:41 Well I’d rather be owned by an oil Barron who is passionate about football and actually wants to come and watch us. And except they’ve got to pay for quality and keep quality ..... simple really.

4217 2018-01-07 22:01:27 Oil is dead, useless. Don't want it, don't need it. We've had free energy forever. Time to use what was given to us for free.   Leave the oil in the ship.
4218 2018-01-07 22:01:21 “that oil” 
4219 2018-01-07 22:01:12 Oil got to him.
4220 2018-01-07 22:01:07 that's why those packs that you have to cook in the pot are deluxe
they come with the oil already
4221 2018-01-07 22:01:03 January 07, 2018 at 05:01PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4222 2018-01-07 22:01:02 Eavesdropping on  people next to me: the don't know what fried ice cream or carnitas are; the woman is surprised the car she bought for $500 is leaking oil; the owners wife is taking bets with a regular on when a new bartender will be fired
4223 2018-01-07 22:00:53 Perhaps some castor oil too.....the crew should have a spoonful every day

4229 2018-01-07 22:00:23 I’m wide awake. I just accept that a few clubs are owned by oil barons who use them as penis extensions, but the majority are owned by business men. Until we whore our team to the former, we’re stuck with the latter.
4230 2018-01-07 22:00:17 Drinking game: Every time someone mentions the name of Harvey Weinstein drink a barrel of crude oil.
4231 2018-01-07 22:00:14 Let’s keep giving oil companies subsidies. Corporate welfare.
4232 2018-01-07 22:00:04 @meekakitty I’m coming to see you at your Columbus show!! I work at an essential oil and skincare shop and I want to know your favorite scents and skincare products :))

4237 2018-01-07 21:59:59 It's patently clear that we are heading for a no/low oil future. Not tomorrow, not even in a decade, but we're heading there. Large companies do very long-term planning for such eventualities and they've already started. Shell stands out but there are others.
4238 2018-01-07 21:59:56 I'm annoyed by the misuse of "invest".

buying Exxon stock = investing in oil production
buying oil futures = speculating on oil

buying mining ASICs = investing in bitcoin
buying bitcoin = speculating on bitcoin

Anyway, it's easy to protect from consumers from spending their hard earned income from capitalists who are trying to poison them with obesity. Just look at how Venezuela is successfully battling the global obesity crisis.
4242 2018-01-07 21:59:20 I watched The Sacred Plant 9 episode documentary series out late last year. The potential of cannabis oil for almost every health issue is unlimited. As Big Pharma owns the medical sector its unlikely too many sufferers will be helped anytime soon.

4252 2018-01-07 21:58:20 And I can't wait to see a "non oil" future. What Kool aid is that you are drinking. It all Al Gore styled comments...and in 10 years the water will be 20m higher....and electric cars will run on solar. We are 50-100 years away from relying on oil 100% think about what oil is in??
4253 2018-01-07 21:58:15 A Putin-linked billionaire who made his fortune off Russian oil gave Senator Graham’s super PAC $800,000.

4265 2018-01-07 21:56:40 2/n it wasn’t about the oil. It was about Kawait, Sadams attack on them. The 2nd Iraq war was about how he treated his own people& Terrorism
4266 2018-01-07 21:56:25 .@nowthisnews Russia exports oil, gas & weapons. In mid-2014, 25% of her economy & 50% of her government revenues came from oil/gas.

4271 2018-01-07 21:55:51 We've made room for newer baking products and retired Choco Bake. Not to worry, our Baking Experts found that 3 Tbsp of baking cocoa plus 1 Tbsp of vegetable oil is a great substitution!
4272 2018-01-07 21:55:44 used coconut oil to make a vegan puppy chow my work party tonight & holy fuck this shit is crack
4273 2018-01-07 21:55:42 Have to give South Korea credit. This is one way to reduce oil imports to Nort Ko.
4274 2018-01-07 21:55:39 The best at home body scrub: olive oil, sugar, shea butter, and honey

4276 2018-01-07 21:55:36 To the naan - like while rolling it out, add the spring onions and sesame oil - would be like a softer version of scallion pancakes

4278 2018-01-07 21:55:15 It was the Democrat party that forced Massachusetts utilities to shut down coal and oil plants.
4279 2018-01-07 21:55:14 Spending millions guarantees a title? If so City should have won it in their first oil season under Mark Hughes. Our chances are slim to none but still better than if we were 6th and playing no CL

4285 2018-01-07 21:54:39 We have seen ‘protein dilution’ from the addition of crappy carbs and fats (mostly cheap flour, sugar, and oil) to the food supply and now people have to eat more calories to get the same absolute quantity of protein.
4286 2018-01-07 21:54:26 Also @GauntletUofC, NASH81: OIL has a great ring to it..... pls consider #nash80 #nash81
4287 2018-01-07 21:54:10 Of course you are aware that off the coast of Santa Barbara oil has been seeping into the ocean.  I'm fact there are 600 natural oil seeps that have been identified that leak between 1 and 5 million barrels of oil a year.

4294 2018-01-07 21:52:44 Please read this. Things like this are going on under our noses.
Our lands and wildlife habitat is being crushed and prepped for oil and fracking operations. 
This is how it starts. 
Please stand up and protect the innocent and vulnerable that share our earth.
4295 2018-01-07 21:52:42 I realized I was making this transition when I had to pay for my own things and worry about gasoline and oil change and spend more time home than going out and scolding kids when they're about to touch my action figures haha also the use of the term action figures instead of toys

4298 2018-01-07 21:51:58 I changed the Car’s oil and I’m a butch dom now
4299 2018-01-07 21:51:41 Try mixing coconut oil, brown sugar, and white sugar. Then scrub your hands when you get home. It will help
4300 2018-01-07 21:51:20 that is only when on a long trip ... most EV's are charged at home ... you start every day FULL. A gas car needs regular visits to a gas station not to mention service station even when NOT on a long trip, oil/lube, how much time does that take?
4301 2018-01-07 21:51:06 Changed my car's oil . . . LoL And my brother don't believe me that I did it by myself.  . . 
4302 2018-01-07 21:51:04 And you will still be overcharging clients.  Anyone paying more than .60 in fees is being fleeced.  Wake up people.....
4303 2018-01-07 21:50:40 We’re never gonna complete with oil money, let’s just keep building a squad that will complete 
4304 2018-01-07 21:50:39 I’m my own worst enemy. Im also my most loving companion, always tugged at the ends of self destruction/sabotage & self healing/love. These two extremities exist like oil in water inside of me, visibly unblended but kept in the same container, taking the same shape.
4305 2018-01-07 21:50:37 Ok but without the pinch it's not an odd man rush the other way
4306 2018-01-07 21:50:30 Oh yeah. I just use oil, no bits.
4307 2018-01-07 21:50:27 You definitely should! And damn. Yeah, I'm not a big spicy food person but Asians can get really serious with their heat. You should also consider sesame oil! More flavor (just don't cook with it). It's more like an add-on.

4309 2018-01-07 21:49:52 @jaketapper talked over #stephenmiller every time he refused to actually respond to a question and went off on a tangent of incoherent babbling about how great Trump is. Tapper didn't fall for the snake oil salesmen prattle. Then ended the interview.
4310 2018-01-07 21:49:47 I cube them and sauté them in extra virgin coconut oil. Then right before I take them out of the pot, I sprinkle cayenne and cinnamon on them
4311 2018-01-07 21:49:46 22 quid for a ball of wool and a sheet of A4? Would you like to buy this jar of snake oil?
4312 2018-01-07 21:49:34 True, but it should have had nothing to react with as I hadn't used anything this morning, washed last night with coconut oil too. Could be just a freak incidence.
4313 2018-01-07 21:49:27 Yeah!! I think it’s because they’re an offshoot of a more expensive brand and they don’t really advertise? The stuff from the Ordinary is really nice but obviously skincare is v personal. And GOD I LOVE UFO OIL 
4314 2018-01-07 21:49:23 use coconut oil it works so good!!
4315 2018-01-07 21:49:11 It’s all about his donors and his profit too.  If we don’t get Zinke and Pruitt out soon, we will be in a huge environmental mess.

4326 2018-01-07 21:47:37 ive gotten really hooked on this indie oil baron simulator called "turmoil", i think you'd enjoy it actually
4327 2018-01-07 21:47:32 And I guess not sure how oil scrubs work? They have to be washed off, being full of salt or nut bits or whatever. Then back to danger cave.
4328 2018-01-07 21:47:30 Not sure. I use a lot of oil, also to clean my face, but not in the shower.

4331 2018-01-07 21:46:55 The big mistake there was the 25 pinch. Wrong place & time in the game.
4332 2018-01-07 21:46:37 Got to pay it or lose out on another target to the oil merchants down the road.
4333 2018-01-07 21:46:33 Hypocrite. What about ANWR? Or is it only NIMBY?  I hope the oil companies literally start fracking, drilling, polluting right next to your house.  I hope your water from your faucets catches on fire and is undrinkable. What you do to others s/b done to you.
4334 2018-01-07 21:46:23 I prefer McDonalds fry oil. It has chicken nugget parts in it. Parts is parts.
4335 2018-01-07 21:46:20 Cooked carrots with Dijon mustard, butter and brown sugar are SO good!! Or boil them with olive oil, basil and rosemary!
4336 2018-01-07 21:46:14 Hmmm is this from the same people who in the 1970s said we were going to have a population bomb? And recently said the world is going to run out of oil? Maybe its true, but so called "experts" have a credibility problem.
4337 2018-01-07 21:45:58 Ha, the way I almost drank oil and water instead of apple cordial and water cause they look alike and are next to each other in my cupboard. Would have been very interesting!

4339 2018-01-07 21:45:41 @aLittleMedic haha its ok when soda companys start putting even worse shit it in thats not sugar we will all die from that instead how about the brominated vegitable oil red 40 or yellow 5 all these chems are killing us and are in more then just soda
4340 2018-01-07 21:45:40 Uh argh. Yes. It just shouldn't be in the shower, or the bath. I'm not cool with bath oil, really, neither, unless there's some medical reason maybe and much cleaning.
4341 2018-01-07 21:45:40 He made fun of my son who is fighting for his life right now. Has about 11 seizures a day. Today already 7. Duke has just approved him for THC oil study. How can people be so heartless. My son is 5. I'm not mad anymore, just pity the jerk.
4342 2018-01-07 21:45:38 My brownies came out so great, that hash oil really made a difference
4343 2018-01-07 21:45:28 @AMISHDEVGAN 
Heard a man selling "Saanday ka oil" on a train station. Turns out it was u in ur typical madaari style on air..
#IndiaNews
4344 2018-01-07 21:45:16 We should totally drill for oil off the CA/OR/WA coast..................
4345 2018-01-07 21:45:12 I just found out the difference between adding oil to my car and an oil change yesterday
4346 2018-01-07 21:45:12 So millions of years ago when no one drilled for oil and the earth was quaking and shifting and falling into the sea......oh never mind!
4347 2018-01-07 21:45:00 If you lightly toast that bread (ideally with olive oil, salt & pepper) before adding cheese/preserves... then I will.
4348 2018-01-07 21:44:59 I’ve been applying coconut oil to it all day. I’m in pain 
4349 2018-01-07 21:44:52 Sugar scrubs with coconut oil makes your lips rlly soft. You should all do it
4350 2018-01-07 21:44:47 Do you oil your scalp
4351 2018-01-07 21:44:42 I hear you, that, and the bread with additional olive oil! 
4352 2018-01-07 21:44:26 Check your oil level, kids. I'm not due for maintenance for another 3k miles, but my oil was 2qts (33%) low. Checking and adding oil is really important and super easy.
4353 2018-01-07 21:44:18 Gasp smh...run to get holy oil...
4354 2018-01-07 21:44:06 Hashi doesnt have black garlic oil.  i need it for my noodzzzz
4355 2018-01-07 21:43:53 من ركن القصيم
4356 2018-01-07 21:43:52 Seems like we've been here before...

"Fake but accurate". Now it's "Fake but Rings True". Kitty Kelly did a better job.

This is like cooking with cheap adulterated Olive Oil.

Democracy Dies in Darkness?  Pffft!
4357 2018-01-07 21:43:44 Some people baptise their lips with too much lip gloss like it is oil, izzorai.
4358 2018-01-07 21:43:44 Have you considered CBD Oil? It has changed my life and is doing amazing things for thousands of people.
4359 2018-01-07 21:43:26 Baby Taemin. Haha. Teka at makakuha ng baby oil at baby powder!
4360 2018-01-07 21:43:22 If you didn't grow up using oil and being taught to be careful, this is such a bad fashion to grab off instagram of a morning...
4361 2018-01-07 21:43:13 Venezuela is a country with 200 billion fucking oil reserves, a year round summer, beautiful landscape, etc. It is doing worse than nations like Hong Kong and Singapore of which are rocks in the ocean without any kind of natural resource.

There is no excuse for this.
4362 2018-01-07 21:42:59 They are welcome to wash their dirty money here at home. Our military have hardly any reserves of oil, diesel etc to fight a war. They could bring home zillions of gallons, who would care? They could set up a R&D Centre (Aust) for dev. of a car & military hardware, infrastructure
4363 2018-01-07 21:42:55 Went out for lunch today. Had food I don't normally eat anymore.
Stomach is not good now.
Going to try a little oil to settle it.
4364 2018-01-07 21:42:53 Kassian has been horrendous and khaira is that guy who had the adrenaline got some lucky goals and isn’t very talented offensively overall.
4365 2018-01-07 21:42:51 Having said that. It was a well known fact that Erdogan was making a fortune on #ISIS oil, fighters and supplies were passing unobstructed across the border from Turkey but things have changed
4366 2018-01-07 21:42:50 my dispensary makes it slightly different than simpson did, we call ours phoenix oil. can also be used topically
4367 2018-01-07 21:42:46 When you bite in and get a jet of hot oil in your face is my favorite part
4368 2018-01-07 21:42:34 You know what we should do - add spring onions/sesame oil. 
4369 2018-01-07 21:42:26 coconut oil >>>>>
4370 2018-01-07 21:42:17 The only ones who don’t are oil company CEOS
4371 2018-01-07 21:42:17 He is the representative of the rich elite reformer establishment in Iran who has been cultivated by the powerful oil lobby to brainwash Americans into believing that the regime is reform-able and viable and wants to cut all kinds of deal
4372 2018-01-07 21:42:10 WHEN I WENT TO SAN DIEGO THAT SAME MONDAY, I PICKED UP AN OIL CHANGE
4373 2018-01-07 21:42:09 Can you change my oil for me then
4374 2018-01-07 21:42:08 it's an oil u ingest, ~182mg THC/ mL
4375 2018-01-07 21:42:04 Washing my hair today. I am@also giving myself a hot oil treatment, & I will put rods in my hair to have curls this week
4376 2018-01-07 21:41:55 Nice trick. The best thing about snake oil solutions is that you get to keep selling more snake oil in perpetuity under the pretext of fixing the prev mess. #Aadhaar was & is a scam. Only solution is to  #DestroyTheAadhaar
4377 2018-01-07 21:41:51 How about the bad pinch by Nurse?
4378 2018-01-07 21:41:49 Maybe when one coast or the other in Florida is devastated by a giant oil spill, maybe the Trumpsters in that state will wake up and realize they voted for a crazed idiot who cares more about big corporations than them.
4379 2018-01-07 21:41:38 Oil field baby.
4380 2018-01-07 21:41:37 Tea tree oil!!! If you dab on there like twice a day it’ll go away with no scar or anything
4381 2018-01-07 21:41:33 All his oil stocks. Hmmm. Can anyonesay cobflixt of interest?
4382 2018-01-07 21:41:17 We need a goal from the forwards here, Oil!
4383 2018-01-07 21:41:15 time for homemade meatloaf covered in shredded cheese with butter herb mashed potatoes made with olive oil and sea salt butter and gravy... yum
4384 2018-01-07 21:41:14 Costly turnover from Mr. Russell...3-1 Hawks after two.
4385 2018-01-07 21:41:13 Olive oil if it feels like a wax kind of blocked or if it’s pressure I tend to gently exhale but with the mouth shut and pinching your nose.
4386 2018-01-07 21:41:10 Reliables ("fossil fuels") dont have limits. Consider the following - without government meddling, the last drop of gasoline will never be used and the last barrel of oil will never be refined. Follow this up the production chain to the last oil well will never be depleted.
4387 2018-01-07 21:41:07 Yea You gotta really make sure you’re using a good moisturizer with it like I mix avocado oil with my Shea butter right after washing with the soap and it works for me bc I’m oily and need it anyways
4388 2018-01-07 21:41:06 You are simply incorrigible. Now oil price is going up under PMB you complain that's the reason for fuel price hike. Yet GEJ kept it at #87
4389 2018-01-07 21:40:59 How have the oil become this big of a joke... Jesus h
4390 2018-01-07 21:40:55 With the bull market for oil I think we see it soon once MJ cools
4391 2018-01-07 21:40:54 I'm at a games night with a few buddies and I'm just so bad at snake oil... actually all the games.
I get so panicy the second it's my go
4392 2018-01-07 21:40:51 I Don't Want Oil Drilling Destroyed Ocean Life Off The Whole West Coast.
4393 2018-01-07 21:40:39 I know you made a resolution to get in shape & try new things, but really, patchouli oil is not necessary for yoga.
4394 2018-01-07 21:40:35 Sure it wasn’t a 2A guy who got a bit ‘confused’, like his orange god?
4395 2018-01-07 21:40:31 Yeah- when success=worse environment (coal, oil drilling , only climate denying country), no affordable health care, layoffs at big companies , less job growth, censorship, and the degrading of our constitution and chaos.
4396 2018-01-07 21:40:31 the furries are wrapping a mineral oil alongside a coop
4397 2018-01-07 21:40:20 Omg that tanning oil is horrible.
4398 2018-01-07 21:40:14 Let's get Foden on loan. That's how much oil money has changed the balance of power has changed. The best case scenario of selling our best player is to get one of their kids for a bit who will never get into their first team
4399 2018-01-07 21:40:09 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
4400 2018-01-07 21:40:00 I believe we should be an independent country again. No-one knows what our exact financial position will be but I do not believe we will be poor. Norway manages very well and so could we. We're worth a lot to rUK and not just because of oil. Bye.
4401 2018-01-07 21:39:59 Same problem here. After 35 years of loyal service, we were told no oil delivery until 9:30 pm 1/8/18. They let us run out of oil for not taking into account more oil will usage with lower temps. Complete lack of customer service. Will be looking for new oil company.
4402 2018-01-07 21:39:58 The Ordinary's Ascorbyl Glucoside 12% solution, and 100% Squalane oil are amazing like wow bless.
4403 2018-01-07 21:39:40 olive oil salt lemon zest black pepper, high heat oven, finish with lemon juice. simple things ain't need nothing special.
4404 2018-01-07 21:39:25 Humans have destroyed Earth in so many ways from polluting its air to dumping oil in its waters
4405 2018-01-07 21:39:22 We use coconut oil now...
4406 2018-01-07 21:39:10 @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense @USNavy @us_navyseals @USMC @USArmy @usairforce Invade Cuba to incite their allies Venezuela to intervene. Use this as credible excuse to topple the pseudo-socialist regime there, and of course, pillage them of their oil - force our way into OPEC.

4408 2018-01-07 21:38:46 The ONE time that Wohl the Hole met Trump. He even slicked  back his hair with what looks like motor oil to try and impress him. Trump doesn't even know him except for being some moron who re-tweets his nonsense tweet after tweet.
4409 2018-01-07 21:38:33 That's all England has. 

And oil can be sourced from elsewhere too.

We can't all work in the oil industry for goodness sake.
4410 2018-01-07 21:38:29 Well...gov’t has been subsidizing business for a long time. And besides, gov’t only subsidized GM until they didn’t need it. Other companies have been subsidized for years, i.e. oil companies, General Electric, farm businesses.
4411 2018-01-07 21:38:26 Pick up some marula oil from drunk elephant after watching @KathleenLights1 video. I’m excited to see if it’s goooood!!
4412 2018-01-07 21:38:26 Burning the midnight oil with Shekhinah's Rose Gold album. 
4413 2018-01-07 21:38:25 I. Am. Ready! I think the same thing. Hate seeing stuff like pasta which is only flour, eggs and oil as some of the more expensive menu items.
4414 2018-01-07 21:38:07 So my mom got me a skillet, big ass bottle of EXTRA VIRGIN olive oil, salt, pepper, and food containers. Im real live living at school
4415 2018-01-07 21:38:02 can you recommend me some specialist trading oil please ? of course at my risk
4416 2018-01-07 21:38:02 I know it's brutal. Us Flames fans need a big oil win today. #Oilersirrelevant

Mom: sugar, coconut oil, and peppermint oil, why?
Declan: okay, good, because I got curious and tasted some, and it was good, so I kinda ate a lot of it....
4419 2018-01-07 21:37:25 لا حووووول 
4420 2018-01-07 21:37:24 I have to tell you something Brydon. I cannot possibly keep it a secret from you any longer.
 I LOVE KALE ... there I said it: with lemon, olive oil, a sprinkling of salt and HONEY. YUM YUM.

4424 2018-01-07 21:37:11 With all due respect, what games have you been watching? Kassian has been downright awful of late and Khaira has hit a wall of late
4425 2018-01-07 21:36:50 Hm... I know it might defeat the purpose of "healthy frying" but I'd venture to guess if you brushed some vegetable or peanut oil on them things before you put them in, it might result in more of a golden color.

4428 2018-01-07 21:36:18 Why is my mom a whole trip talking about those singers at the funeral yesterday were so good it made her want to anoint her throat with oil.....let me add olive oil to my grocery list 
4429 2018-01-07 21:36:10 Raymond’s in his Sunday best, he’s usually up to his chest in oil and grease 
4430 2018-01-07 21:36:09 Oya X-ray eyes.. Someone that works in an oil company
4431 2018-01-07 21:36:02 My girl put me on shit like face masks, bonnets and the right lotions to use. Ima put her on to how to use jumper cables, changing a tire and how to change oil.
4432 2018-01-07 21:35:57 So does Florida's governor, especially after the BP oil spill back in 2010, I believe. There will be room for compromise as most people can't afford $4.00 + a gallon for very long.
4433 2018-01-07 21:35:44 Wait I thought brushing it when it’s wet gives you split ends  today I put oil in it when it was a lil damp and i stopped shampooing every day
4434 2018-01-07 21:35:41 BURNT PANS? A few drops of lemon oil and boiling water will remove burnt food #healthcoach #essentialoils #diy #healthtip #kitchenlab
4435 2018-01-07 21:35:41 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
Hag 2:12 KJV
4436 2018-01-07 21:35:28 A shame.  At this point, a full mix up might work.  For example, try:

Khaira-McDavid-Kassian

Give McDavid guys that have proved lately that they will put in 110% nightly.

4442 2018-01-07 21:34:52 Worth mentioning I trade short-term for a living, all I am looking for here is a tradeable technical pullback (a few dollars). I'm as bullish as they get long-term for oil and I've been adding to my oil service & cnd energy holdings on every dip since June.

4446 2018-01-07 21:34:41 This game is putting me to sleep. The Oil have become the most boring team in the NHL. #EDMvsCHI #LetsGoOilers

4450 2018-01-07 21:34:10 All my truck needs is normal maintenance, filters and oil change. Costs over $300 in parts, and a couple hours of my time. Buy a big truck they said, it'll be fun they said.

4452 2018-01-07 21:33:56 That is what I think too and I have never understood this year why I have read comments from others to the contrary saying he is a bust at C. That has not been my observation.
4453 2018-01-07 21:33:49 They make everything w/ almond oil which I am super allergic to so I nvr really got into the Lush obsession? Like all the things they make could use less harsh allergens
4454 2018-01-07 21:33:46 Yeah that’s fine just pour oil over everything
4455 2018-01-07 21:33:44 The guy works in an Oil company!
4456 2018-01-07 21:33:43 And Matic was? Oil money.
4457 2018-01-07 21:33:37 The trouble with that is that (unlike Scotland) England has very little (like financial services and cars stuff) that can't just simply be produced/sourced elsewhere. I think there are already real fears that Lon finance will take a big brexit hit. Scot oil ain't going nowhere.
4458 2018-01-07 21:33:37 Coconut oil is the best. Period.

4462 2018-01-07 21:33:33 on each occasion the President talks the 'truth', a sane person wants to become politician
4463 2018-01-07 21:33:33 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
4464 2018-01-07 21:33:33 That's nice but... where's my olive oil?
4465 2018-01-07 21:33:30 Ive read them a bedtime story....sang them a lullaby AND given them lavender oil massages but they're still awake!!! First day back to school gonna be rough!! 
4466 2018-01-07 21:33:26 I thought yeah let me check out the ameera london argan oil, it’s 39.99 for a 100ml bottle. a mini can of coke is 150ml.

4470 2018-01-07 21:32:59 I've never tried olive oil! Thanks! And I definitely need to increase my water intake. Breastfeeding zaps me for sure.
4471 2018-01-07 21:32:58 Mane Choice, coconut oil, castor oil and protective styles lol. It grows quicker when I leave it alone
4472 2018-01-07 21:32:52 1. Unsurprisingly another quote that shows no value to your claim regarding the Oil being stolen. 
2. What it does show is that again you have been shown or presented a deceptive hypocritical position. 
3. Apparently your comprehension fails you as Red herrings do not help.
4473 2018-01-07 21:32:39 Oh Ill check for that next time Im shopping there again. Also bought hot oil lmao. That shit is brutal haha.

4477 2018-01-07 21:32:04 Are you really real? What, What did he do? anything other then taking away National Park Land for his oil buddies or kicking people out of America ,or taking us backwards as far as the environment goes and clean  water. oh ya he really did a lot to make America great NOT,
4478 2018-01-07 21:32:01 ISIS has been starved of resources, mostly because bribes shriveled up and oil is still in the $50s a barrel instead of $100.
But please, do tell me what ROE change has meant the most to you.
4479 2018-01-07 21:31:58 I honestly believe it's a combination of things (fructose, palm oil, lack of exercise, large portions etc etc etc). If only it was as simple as one thing. And I also think we all have different metabolisms, what works for one, could make another sick/fat
4480 2018-01-07 21:31:36 Stocked up on The Ordinary, l'occtaine almond oil & Retin A because I'm 25 next week. No more treating my face like a sponge.
4481 2018-01-07 21:31:28 And a oil change.just come get my car and take the mf for me pleaseeeeeeee.
4482 2018-01-07 21:31:25 This needs to be sent to every media outlet in the states covered. Oil/gas companies have had total control of information about the "benefits" and positives of extraction operations. We need a balanced, factual pushback.
4483 2018-01-07 21:31:19 Don’t forget the Charlie Carp fish oil fertiliser commercials

4487 2018-01-07 21:30:47 #Peppermint essential oil is one of my favorite oils to use. It has been so helpful with dealing with allergies, sinus issues and even some muscle aches. The cool and refreshing smell also gives me a quick mood boost!

4490 2018-01-07 21:30:26 Why do we get upset with price-fixing in most cases but then ask for price-fixing in connection with the oil-producing cartel? Why is oil price fixing better than other price-fixing?
4491 2018-01-07 21:30:22 What is your position on expanding offshore drilling? trump wants to let oil companies drill in your district.

4500 2018-01-07 21:29:23 I could have sworn I smelled Avon bath oil recently. ‘Skin So Soft’ 
It was out of context too (no baths) so I was furiously trying to place it! Avon has a lot to answer for.
4501 2018-01-07 21:29:12 I'll take @JakeTapper's cutting off Stephen Miller's snake oil or @KatyTur's bold refusal to accept Jim Jordan's trash over most other interviewers just smiling tightly & letting Trump allies & GOP hacks lie through their well-bleached teeth any day of the week!

4503 2018-01-07 21:29:08 And then there's the simple fact that analysts and shareholders of the largest oil companies began to demand that they begin the process of a) going green, and b) facing a looming non/low-oil future.

4507 2018-01-07 21:28:38 I’m becoming an essential oil person because of #ouifresh by @abeautifulmess + @doterra oils I was gifted for the holidays. I ordered a bunch of oil stuff on Amazon to begin trying new oil things!

4509 2018-01-07 21:28:22 Jimmy has never been a puppet. That explains why he was denigrated by corrupt DC, corporate media & big oil.
You're free to back Trump.
4510 2018-01-07 21:28:15 Still wont be enough. You're reneging on World Aid deals, selling off protected land for oil drilling, removing worker safeguards so companies can make bigger profits and deporting all the Americans you can, but still wont be enough for your new outgoings like your Wall and Golf.
4511 2018-01-07 21:28:13 "But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you." Matthew 6:17-18
4512 2018-01-07 21:28:11 And don't get me started on the cannibalistic aspects of using baby oil on children...
4513 2018-01-07 21:28:09 But it is burned for electricity. In the northeast, we shut down nuclear plants and stop gas pipelines and voila! Oil for electricity. I don't like it either.

4519 2018-01-07 21:27:30 can u record a clip of you pronouncing the word “oil”
4520 2018-01-07 21:27:14 Geez, that would be my dream job..! One of my friends’ great grandfathers sold his oil Co. To Shell for $3.6B. My friends grandfather lived his life as a philanthropist. I’d love to spend my days looking at important causes to help , asking nothing but good works in return.
4521 2018-01-07 21:27:11 Tea tree oil!!! Just dab it with a q-tip literally looks like I never had one
4522 2018-01-07 21:27:05 Get some coconut oil from Aldi, it works wonders honey 
4523 2018-01-07 21:26:55 Except financial services, cars, stuff like that. What proportion of UK revenues comes from Scottish oil right now? And how much in future years,
4524 2018-01-07 21:26:54 BTW some of us are fmr GOP that actually believe we shouldn't be putting oil pipelines across this country (that isn't for the greater good- it's for big business) and we we should preserve our natural resources & environment.  This decision is by the "new" GOP- ie. paid off
4525 2018-01-07 21:26:53 The only bad water is from drilling a water well where there are shallow gas and oil deposits.  It’s not fracking fluid that is in the yellow tap water. It’s black gold
4526 2018-01-07 21:26:44 Easy one would be to go back and buy a load of shares in Apple when they were in a slump years ago, or put money in to  Amazon or Google when they were still small. The biggest earner could be oil but every scenario I can think of would need a lot of effort and, well, fuck that
4527 2018-01-07 21:26:31 need to find and extract minerals, oil, gas, coal from ground through drilling sideways under Zeinke, Ryan ,Mulvaney, Romney, Flake homes, by these new fracking/drilling opportunities!
4528 2018-01-07 21:26:24 A big number of these decided to get out of heavy oil plays, globally, not just in Alberta.
4529 2018-01-07 21:26:23 I'll try anything lavender. I use lavender shampoo, lavender soap, lavender laundry detergent & dryer sheets, lavender incense & lavender oil in the diffuser, I like lavender kombucha, and I grow it in the garden. Hell why not lavender beer? Yes, I'm weird.
4530 2018-01-07 21:26:16 Bought an organic oil cos apparently oily skin needs just as much moisture as dry skin. My face currently feels like a frying pan, peng x
4531 2018-01-07 21:25:57 You're probably to you to remember what Tory did to Scotland in the 1980s, Coal,Steel,shipyards, apprenticeships all gone under Thatchers Tory, who was first to help oil workers, Steel plant, etc, SNP, that's who ,no Tory to be seen, so where's your proof
4532 2018-01-07 21:25:53 You don't seem too research-oriented, but the 70s lead-up to the supply glut is an interesting thing. Factors: end of the Vietnam war, the ME oil embargo, North Sea, Japanese post-war mastery of American W. Edwards Deming's statistical process control, US highway speed-limits...

4538 2018-01-07 21:25:08 Oil rig over there. It eats the trash off the workers. I don't believe that this will pass with any part of our coastal states. If one thinks. Natural Disasters in that area is only 1 problem and, a major one too. People working trying to make an income will see a WALL of water
4539 2018-01-07 21:25:08 When you start feeling the fat stay on your tongue.

4542 2018-01-07 21:24:45 the Irony is that zionist regime is presently plotting to have a part of Persia, in order to have access to its oil. America could have had all of it if President Trump had prioritized American interests..
4543 2018-01-07 21:24:29 Twitter handles are a bit like personalised car rego plates - they're the first thing anybody knows about you. Most are banal and then there is "Gay Lube Oil" which would be weird if he was gay, but is intriguing since he's straight.
4544 2018-01-07 21:23:39 I'm using a tea tree oil mix to clean doll hair in my room, so now the air stinks, but fortunately I quite like the smell and it's clearing out my sinuses like a charm

4546 2018-01-07 21:23:32 Fossil fuels, mining and quarrying account for just over 8% of our GDP. Manufacturing, excluding forestry/ag/fishing, accounts for over 10%. If you look at employment by sector, despite GDP contribution, oil and gas are not equivalently large employers.
4547 2018-01-07 21:23:06 Blahh I need a oil change but don’t feel like getting up
4548 2018-01-07 21:23:04 by making that stand Trump has simply decided to sacrifice American interest in the region in exchange of supporting Zionist regime. President Trump has sacrificed its tie with the number two oil producer, with one of the most powerful army with Turkey,

4559 2018-01-07 21:22:04 I just had one of the first intriguing conversations in my bible whatsapp group regarding "the anointing oil and why we anoint"

In the process of teaching this, i began to learn myself! 

The anointing experience in the old convenant is the Holy spirit & power in the new.
4560 2018-01-07 21:21:46 in 80's Conservative govts (Getty et al) bet, BADLY, year after year the price of oil would rise, leading to deficit after deficit...and by early 90s situation was SO BAD AB was spending more on interest payments on debt than on social programs. WAY before NDP ever came around ..

4566 2018-01-07 21:21:03 You can make your own with some coconut oil, sugar, and an essential oil. It’s nice cause you can customize it to what you like. Or dry brushing, look it up on YouTube I’ve started doing it now that it’s cold and it helps really exfoliate the skin!

4569 2018-01-07 21:20:38 Nobody’s saying Saddam didn’t murder thousands,Iraq war was not over that,Iraq war was over dumb ass bush telling the world Saddam was in league with osama bin laden which most people knew to be a lie because they hated each other,it was all about America& Britains thirst for oil

4577 2018-01-07 21:19:47 Yeah, like the oil in Iraq will pay for the war? Is there no amount of bullshit he can throw and the public will believe? Wake the fu#% up people!! This is our money that they are spending on a wall we don't want!!!

4584 2018-01-07 21:18:37 Pretty interesting that social outrage is focussed on businesses rather than the #Liberal government who raised income taxes hydro rates gas prices and heating oil prices on low-income people.   Hopefully more people will recognize these corrupt Liberal apologists.
4585 2018-01-07 21:18:04 olive oil helps or coconut oil. Drink a lot of water :)
4586 2018-01-07 21:17:56 @goop So my detox granola bars didn’t bar up. Just a tasty crumble. Did I cook too long? Not long enough? Too little oil?
4587 2018-01-07 21:17:53 Yes! Kind of.  It’s on a road trip next weekend, provided I can get some engine oil to put in it.
4588 2018-01-07 21:17:43 Ditto - low slow simmer, just enough to make some steam. I add peppermint or spearmint oil in winter. It's good for sinuses and lung congestion. Don't run the bathroom exhaust fan when you shower. Damp washcloth on top of heater vents.

4593 2018-01-07 21:17:04 Yes and no. Norway's vast fortune (i.e. the sovereign wealth fund) has come from the extraction and sale of gas and oil - fossil fuels that have driven climate change. There's much to admire and copy from Norway but there's also a lot of less than honest behavior.
4594 2018-01-07 21:17:00 With the @USGS estimating 22% of the worlds oil and natural gas being located under the Arctic, it raises alarms for when sea ice levels disappear at the alarming speeds they are. The Arctic will be exploited with disregard for marine life which faces extinction by 2060!

4603 2018-01-07 21:16:17 That sounds like an unpleasant priming problem.

How cold does oil need to be to freeze?

Or is it impurities in the oil lines, i.e. water, that are frozen?
4604 2018-01-07 21:16:12 They say, "money makes the world go round"...ain't that the truth!  Or rather oil makes the world go round . I feel so sad for all those who lost their lives in the Iraq war - civilians and troops - and their families, whilst American companies made millions .

4613 2018-01-07 21:14:56 Who inspires you with more confidence, the measured, professional approach of a man in a suit; or the snake oil salesman approach by the Bcash spokesperson? 
4614 2018-01-07 21:14:48 It looks like a heat rash or rash from the cold. My babies get them on their cheeks when it’s really cold or hot.  Put a lukewarm cloth on them and Vaseline / coconut oil
4615 2018-01-07 21:14:43 Jamaican castor oil helps.
4616 2018-01-07 21:14:36 I suspect Uganda, will one day discover like Togo did recently that the country had been producing billions of dollars in oil and gas whereas none was declared.
4617 2018-01-07 21:14:25 my hair is really in a sorry state... i'm gonna buy olive oil tomorrow and other masks
4618 2018-01-07 21:14:21 Lamp Oil, Rope, Bombs, you want it? It's yours my friend, as long as you have enough roofies.

4622 2018-01-07 21:13:54 My cravings are dictating gourmet pizza baked in a brick oven. Sausage, Arugula, Sundried Tomatoes and Truffle Oil
4623 2018-01-07 21:13:27 Safe to say Strome is much more comfortable playing down the middle. You actually notice him when he plays at centre.
4624 2018-01-07 21:13:24 The teal oil color is amazing on its own but when you add the fan with the delicate Japanese flowers in bloom it just makes it look like a painting! I say get it on a canvas for inspiration!
4625 2018-01-07 21:13:23 burning that midnight oil again! like Brother J said ... it's time 2 build!
4626 2018-01-07 21:13:22 Face mask and coconut oil hair mask on. Yup, I look so attractive right now... lmao

4630 2018-01-07 21:12:44 Have you considered trying CBD Oil? It is helping a lot of people and has no side effects.
4631 2018-01-07 21:12:28 So it's ok to destroy other countries land and use their oil. LoL it's called regulations.
4632 2018-01-07 21:12:25 #China: An Iranian tanker has collided with a Chinese freighter in the #EastChinaSea resulting in an explosion causing large amounts of oil condensate to spill into the sea, as well as thirty-two crew members unaccounted for.
4633 2018-01-07 21:12:03 So much it hurts. It's hard to watch them suffer. Every time he has a seizure, after I throw up. My heart literally hurts. Just ready for the THC oil treatment!!!!!
4634 2018-01-07 21:11:51 A rule that didn’t exist for the first 20 years of the Internet, during which time it boomed. Take your snake oil somewhere else, Mister Less Than 200 Tweets.
4635 2018-01-07 21:11:48 me @ coconut oil
4636 2018-01-07 21:11:46 So hydrogen takes lots of electric to produce. EVs need electric to run. Why add an additional component to the process. You said above just use wind, solar etc to produce hydrogen why not just pump that straight to EVs. Oh and how much electric does it take to refine oil to fuel
4637 2018-01-07 21:11:45 how else can they enact their plan to take over oil worldwide?
4638 2018-01-07 21:11:38 #SamyGemayel: I had the right to express my concern and fears over Lebanon's natural wealth after that only one bidder had been approved in the oil exploration tender

4641 2018-01-07 21:11:22 Why is that? Norway doesn’t seem to have a problem making a profit and getting tax from their North Sea oil. Not suggesting the Westminster government have been lax are you?
4642 2018-01-07 21:11:16 Has a single Oil king player worked out as legitimate NHLer yet? Who are the experts that think / thought Bob Green is someone smart that should be making draft decisions? Oil kings win doesn't justify running nhl drafting if you ask me.
4643 2018-01-07 21:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: moist crust with damp coconut oil and apple wood smoked bacon.
4644 2018-01-07 21:10:46 Just wanted to let ya know, oil should be the last step, other things (like moisturizers) cant get absorbed if you put them on top of the oil :) 
4645 2018-01-07 21:10:40 “Genocidal invasions”? Genocide is a Muslem tenant.
“Theft of oil”? We pay for our oil and throw in a LOT OF FOREIGN AID besides.
4646 2018-01-07 21:10:36 I’m a Valvoline just trying to get my oil changed and some damn fool in front of me decides it’s the perfect time for someone to fix their trunk when I’ve been waiting AN HOUR and there is still a huge line of cars behind me

4649 2018-01-07 21:10:16 Have you considered CBD Oil... it is helping a lot of people. Organic, no gmo’s, non-addictive.
4650 2018-01-07 21:10:15 Venezuelan President Maduro has ordered the issuance of the first 100 mln Petros, an oil-backed national cryptocurrency. He also indicated that each Petro would have the value of a single barrel of oil.
4651 2018-01-07 21:09:50 glucoasmine, cod liver oil
4652 2018-01-07 21:09:47 Devastating impact? 2 years ago I did not see any devastation or impact. Nor in Gulf from Horizon blowing up. I am glad the devastating impact from all the oil companies past failures hasn't stopped production. We r not relying on other countries anymore & energy is cheap
4653 2018-01-07 21:09:41 Funny you just said that. I'm currently working with a patient with Dimentia and we're doing a study on her where all she does is smell Rosemary oil several times a day. Her memory is improving & they're starting 2 use this for treatment. You should look it up. Interesting read.

4661 2018-01-07 21:07:36 she also compared stealing jobs to stealing oil when what America actually does is buy oil damn Lilly what was that about education again
4662 2018-01-07 21:07:33 Is it worth losing our Clean air/water/lands/oceans/sea's to your deregulations/corporate Raping? 99% of this country has nothing in those stock markets! 1969 having no Regulations set our Rivers on fire/coal ash in our drinking water/Corperate raping of our lands/oil spills.
4663 2018-01-07 21:07:30 I recommend using olbas oil or vicks :)
4664 2018-01-07 21:07:19 I just put some rosemary in my oil diffuser & my quality of life has already increased 
4665 2018-01-07 21:07:10 No doubt there. Which is why it was insane to think they were going to play hot hockey for months on end to get in.
4666 2018-01-07 21:07:05 Yeah: no DACA, no CHIP, a border wall paid by Americans, bank deregulations facilitating another huge crisis coming up, oil drilling off USA coasts, befriending longtime adversaries, alienating longtime allies, etc...yeah...great!
4667 2018-01-07 21:07:03 I felt crappy this morning, put some Thieves oil on the bottoms of my feet, and BOOM cough settles, energy still up, icky head and stomach feeling: gone! #YoungLiving #YLEO #thieves
4668 2018-01-07 21:06:51 i want to do an oil painting of dan avidans gross thumbs
4669 2018-01-07 21:06:45 Ooh, "you have to put up with"...  You really have it tough, don't you?  Feel so sorry for you.  Yes, it's sarcasm.  When you don't know if you can afford more heating oil, and it's soooo cold... Then, and only then, I'll feel sorry for you.
4670 2018-01-07 21:05:50 Say YES to CBD Oil USPatent6630507 for kids w seizures
4671 2018-01-07 21:05:45 Have you thought about using CBD Oil? It is helping a LOT of people.
4672 2018-01-07 21:05:35 They've certainly had injury concerns on the backend but far less than most teams...just look at the Ducks.
4673 2018-01-07 21:05:16 @onesmileymonkey I take a dose of vitamin C and oregano oil as soon as I feel the beginning of cold or flu #ShoppersFlu
4674 2018-01-07 21:05:12 in first year of uni my lecturer offered me poppers in the library and now my friend is dropping CBD oil under her tongue. I’m glad my university experience hasn’t changed
4675 2018-01-07 21:05:07 It is all a game , a big political game , who ever wins will be rewarded with enormous  amount of oil gold and gas & most of this game is played out in the Middle East which is super wealthy & religious .

4677 2018-01-07 21:04:56 Broken garage door opener spring, new battery for the truck, extra home heating oil... this cold snap is getting expensive. 
4678 2018-01-07 21:04:56 @GOP @realDonaldTrump also want to roll back safety culture and protections put in place after the biggest oil spill in American history-- #DeepwaterHorizon. 200 million barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf for over 87 days, and 11 people tragically lost their lives! BP's fault!
4679 2018-01-07 21:04:44 Andrew this is all financed by Norway’s sale of Oil A little hypocritical of you
4680 2018-01-07 21:04:33 1969 we allowed people like u/the Big Industry to have their way with no Regulations!They caught our Rivers on fire dumping poisons in them,Coal ash ran off/destroyed our drinking water/oil spills messed up our shore lines.Short term Boom/Long term Trillion decades long clean up.
4681 2018-01-07 21:04:21 Average new car fuel economy in the USA:
August 2014: 25.8 mpg
December 2017: 25.0 mpg

Next time oil prices jump up, I will (again) laugh at all those idiots commuting alone in full-size SUVs who cry at the gas pump...
4682 2018-01-07 21:04:06 Some say his snot alone could seal any oil spill.
4683 2018-01-07 21:04:05 But they aren't oil producing
4684 2018-01-07 21:04:04 Emmanuel Macron @EmmanuelMacron 
 Very proud that France has become the first country in the world today to ban any new oil exploration licences with immediate effect and all oil extraction by 2040. #KeepItInTheGround #MakeOurPlanetGreatAgain  Gee? I wonder why?
4685 2018-01-07 21:03:50 Burping fish oil  this might be the reason why I “forget” to take them most days.
4686 2018-01-07 21:03:40 What the hell is “cold press” olive oil?
4687 2018-01-07 21:03:38 Hurry - before your daddy’s oil rigs get there. You’re an outdoors like I’m a brain surgeon. #silverspooner
4688 2018-01-07 21:03:37 Like most goalies who are go through rough stretches, they go down a tad sooner and that is where he is at the moment. Despite this not being totally on him, allowing 5 a night will wear on almost anyone.
4689 2018-01-07 21:03:34 Coconut oil as the base. Add activated Charcoal, A dash of Himalayan pink salt, sodium bicarbonate, coral calcium, drops of peppermint or spearmint essential oil. Mix thoroughly.

4692 2018-01-07 21:03:19 I bought CBD oil from the co-op on the off chance that it helps me taper off my SSRIs in this final stage where the substance is fully leaving my body. the price has held me back but this one was a squirt bottle and it was 80 days' worth for $25 which didn't seem so bad
4693 2018-01-07 21:03:18 The DOW artificially inflated, investors are stock trigger happy. This will not last!  This administration is holding onto the past (oil economy) China is smart enough to take the lead in future auto manufacturing. Strict co2 emissions forces co's to innovate. NYT wrote about it.
4694 2018-01-07 21:03:04 Ain’t rubbed oil on anyone’s daughter bum for a while now
4695 2018-01-07 21:02:50 I like to top a lasagne with sliced courgette a drizzle of olive oil and fresh herbs and grate in carrots with the mince(kids don't even know this is there).

4700 2018-01-07 21:02:17 Okay internet make me an app for adults. I need an app that put a me on a schedule for all important life things like putting oil in my car and how often I should wash my jeans. Just put it all on a calender and tell me when I should put $20 in my savings. GUIDE ME
4701 2018-01-07 21:02:16 Let us See the Oil Industry lower consumer prices at the pump...noticed here in Oregon prices at the pump just jumped another 5 cents...They are the biggest consumer necessity, expense which affects all low & middle class consumers far the greatest expense even more than taxes!
4702 2018-01-07 21:02:12 Thought the oil life made you rich & famous tho?
4703 2018-01-07 21:02:01 I agree.  Then, of course, would come lawsuits like from the people whose family members were slaughtered because doctors and hospitals would not use natural cures like oregano oil for those "untreatable" fungal lung diseases.  "My people die from lack of knowledge."
4704 2018-01-07 21:01:57 Ft.Worth:  WB I-30 @ US-287 there's some sort of oil sludge spill, it's listed as a Haz Mat Spill.
4705 2018-01-07 21:01:41 did she just add them to the pasta? I remember the most barebones pasta I ever had was pasta with the last bits of olive oil, salt and thinly sliced garlic.
4706 2018-01-07 21:01:40 I knew that you have to watch out for salad dressings. That’s why I try and have my dad make his whenever possible. It’s pretty much olive oil, garlic, fresh lemon juice and salt and pepper
4707 2018-01-07 21:01:39 List...in detail, sovereign countries in the recent past (last 100 years) who “started” war or the presence of military off a foreign coast or in a foreign notion...hint: it’s far less than the US’s interference across the globe for oil, politics, wealth
4708 2018-01-07 21:01:33 4.Bribery scandal of one of the #110 ministers in Parliament.

4709 2018-01-07 21:01:29 If the score holds, I'm sure this would be the first NFL playoff game where the only touchdown was scored by an Oil City, PA native.
4710 2018-01-07 21:01:26 One time my mom bought a bottle of oil for 52 dollars
4711 2018-01-07 21:01:13 Palm oil doesn't work , I'll definitely use gloves if there is a next time
4712 2018-01-07 21:00:56 Just rose hip oil and sweet almond oil
4713 2018-01-07 21:00:51 real shit, if you experiment a bit most frozen vegetables can be microwaved to the perfect texture and hit with a bit of olive oil/salt
4714 2018-01-07 21:00:46 Dude get the Ordinary peel!! It’s actually nice and so cheap. Also UFO oil or something else? Because UFO is my jam.

4720 2018-01-07 21:00:02 there’s oil in my ears
4721 2018-01-07 20:59:38 Missed this weekend guys, very sorry. I may have been slightly chemically poisoned from breathing, burning oil fumes.... :(

I already feel like its been forever and I deeply miss our community with only two days lost off stream. I miss my "dudes"!
4722 2018-01-07 20:59:35 Oiled my scalp with peppermint oil and now I’m tripping trying to figure out wth is the peppermint smell every two seconds 
4723 2018-01-07 20:59:23 @OatmegaBar Can you make it mote noticeable that your products contain fish oil? My dad has a deathly seafood allergy and is not typically on the lookout for fish on the ingredients list when buying protein bars.
4724 2018-01-07 20:58:50 which oil cleanser?
4725 2018-01-07 20:58:48 Oil going somewhere. Check radiator for oil= blown head gasket. Or enough oil getting by the piston rings to smell but not enough to smoke. Either way its not good news. I don't see a cheap easy solution here sir.
4726 2018-01-07 20:58:45 So yall not putting oil and vinegar on yall sandwiches?.. buggin
4727 2018-01-07 20:58:42 Yup it does that! Lots of lotion and mix baby oil in with your body wash when you take a shower. Sounds weird but it helps a lot!
4728 2018-01-07 20:58:41 Yep! It’s all tossed in a vinaigrette of lemon juice, olive oil, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, paprika, and whatever dried herbs you want. And I’m gonna serve it with some crumbled feta on top
4729 2018-01-07 20:58:35 1. The Oil is purchased. Not stolen. 
2. The Muslim controlled countries have the lowest amount of Women's and Human rights then anywhere in the world. 
3. I wouldn't call Americans ignorant especial when Muslim countries have higher rates of iliteracy and no scientific impact,
4730 2018-01-07 20:58:27 Take in shelter in that nice warm saudi oil
4731 2018-01-07 20:58:26 The coconut oil is good for you. Mmm, Coffee... We are snowbound and all out, so I'll have to virtually enjoy yours here!
4732 2018-01-07 20:58:17 heat some coconut oil, add honey. Apply on face with a cotton ball, goodbye dead skin.
4733 2018-01-07 20:58:16 Not heard about peppermint oil?
4734 2018-01-07 20:58:15 Number of reasons , one is tremendous amount of oil & gas , the other is to protect Israeli & its benefits , third is strategic reasons & also for control to make sure Russia doesn’t take a bigger piece of the world .
4735 2018-01-07 20:58:13 Olbas oil on ya chest ....rub it in xxx

An yes a clove of garlic squashed in a tissue or against the sole of us door in an old sock ....does work 

I know 
4736 2018-01-07 20:58:11 Very true, in any multi-year bull market though (which I suspect we are in for oil), I'd expect large pullbacks and periods of consolidation. Positioning is such now that any sell-off is likely to be exaggerated (a long squeeze).
4737 2018-01-07 20:58:05 Tanker in east china sea collision-
More oil unplanned for Nth Korea ?
4738 2018-01-07 20:58:03 The guy they cut (because he made more money) is kicking in the playoffs as we speak. The 4-12 Colts are watching the same playoffs as the Chargers. Those abs don’t need oil, they are spectacular
4739 2018-01-07 20:57:54 Hey, Demented Donny! I'll bet you didn't know it, but like the Queen of England who owns the United Kingdom, the POTUS gets to keep the stock market's money while in office! You're finally a multi-trillionaire! Even Putin isn't one of those & he owns all the oil in Siberia! SAD!
4740 2018-01-07 20:57:53 I still love the kid. His resurgence has been a nice story since the Oil are letting me down.
4741 2018-01-07 20:57:34 I make a vegan cashew “cheese” sauce (puréed cashews, olive oil, nutritional yeast, garlic and onion) and mix that with @PrimalKitchenCo Chipotle Lime Mayo and add capers and dill!
Honestly, it’s a flavor-packed sauce that tastes better than cream cheese 
4742 2018-01-07 20:57:09 They're like an oil spill...it seeps into everything and does permanent damage. 
4743 2018-01-07 20:56:52 The shapeshifting lizard people can time travel too, actually!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
4744 2018-01-07 20:56:44 Sesame oil is so good. I especially like using it to make fried rice!
4745 2018-01-07 20:56:43 Yes for finale. We are getting Rs  two lakh per vote. We are soon going to be a millionaire and we can distribute burn oil for free. VIKAS DESERVES THE WIN
4746 2018-01-07 20:56:24 Witch hazel as a cleanser/toner and coconut oil for moisture. Pores feel clogged? Vaseline and a hot wet rag
4747 2018-01-07 20:56:22 Attacking off rush is one and done.Drai doing a fly by is not helping at all. Need to get at those loose 2nd chances
4748 2018-01-07 20:56:20 I guess screaming in front of Trump towers,flipping it off didn't work, the movie on broadway, that had to close early, didn't work.. Google oil drilling. Not like he is going to be drilling @POTUS  beach. @MichaelMoore360  has lost his frigging mind.
4749 2018-01-07 20:56:06 Cod liver oil. Yeuk! Tasted absolutely disgusting. I well remember this,hardly ever caught a cold though.
4750 2018-01-07 20:55:36 fish oil pills!
4751 2018-01-07 20:55:36 Getting an oil change and grocery shopping  I could use a pick me up
4752 2018-01-07 20:55:24 Do they know what our heating bills would be in Michigan right now without pipelines and oil?
4753 2018-01-07 20:55:24 I think cause spreadable butter is more oil than actual dairy
4754 2018-01-07 20:55:15 Coconut  oil 
4755 2018-01-07 20:55:15 This morning, before breakfast, I ran up from Craiglockhart to Harlaw and Threipmuir and back, 20 miles in total, with no fuel, on an empty stomach, apart from a cup of coffee blended with coconut oil and butter. Zero carbs. Unthinkable five years ago.
4756 2018-01-07 20:54:58 Husband: So I’m going to rub the chicken down with olive oil-
Me: You said butter wrong.
H: ... you wanted to eat healthier.
Me: Shut your mouth!
H: ... so I’m going to rub the chicken down with butter...

Then I went back to drinking my gluten free beer.
4757 2018-01-07 20:54:57 Can’t even really blame injuries . It’s just a mess really .
4758 2018-01-07 20:54:56 why does hwasa's body shine ? Does she put highlights there or oil
4759 2018-01-07 20:54:52 as long as the skin is kept on you can do ok with just salt, oil and rosemary, if the skin is off you've forsaken the chicken and should give it to your favourite nearby pet
4760 2018-01-07 20:54:39 Fish oil? What was the purpose of this?
4761 2018-01-07 20:54:28 Al Gore you're a nitwit. Get off your soap box and. Go find out what really  happened to our climate. Everything is changing and if we all quit driving cars, burning oil and using electricity tomorrow it wouldn't make one bit of difference.
4762 2018-01-07 20:54:07 Genius!  Plus, he just eliminated the $.09 per barrel tax for oil spill cleanup, so HE gets to personally pay for the cleanup!
4763 2018-01-07 20:54:06 Also try raw honey and organic coconut oil it works well and gives you a glow up.
4764 2018-01-07 20:54:05 getting my oil changed makes me feel like a whole new person
4765 2018-01-07 20:54:01 I use deep conditioner and Moroccan oil and my hair usually holds up when I go to dry places.
4766 2018-01-07 20:53:59 I’ve been doing that and for some reason it just won’t freaking go away! Someone told me tea tree oil and vitamin E oil help so I may give that a try
4767 2018-01-07 20:53:49 But most are not getting burned consistently. On that play the puck was still in front of him. Holtby goes down a lot to so I hear you. But I don’t see him do it much unless puck is below icing line.
4768 2018-01-07 20:53:47 Vit C and peppermint oil
4769 2018-01-07 20:53:32 Coconut oil is good to put in their food and can also apply to their feet etc and hibbi scrub
4770 2018-01-07 20:53:23 Everyone should have the joy of spilling a half bottle of olive oil on the floor
4771 2018-01-07 20:53:21 At Wallerfield, some older gentlemen making a cook...they heat up a pot of oil, toss in 5 whole scotch bonnet and then some chicken to fry 
4772 2018-01-07 20:53:21 @OANN Can you verify the Iranian oil on the tanker that sank was really headed to S Korea? S Korea buying Iranian oil??? Runs into Chinese "Freighter/Bulk Carrier"???
4773 2018-01-07 20:53:15 Thoughts and prayers with the 32 shipmates on an Iranian oil tanker missing at sea after a collision this morning 

4774 2018-01-07 20:52:57 the issue with that is that what you believe in isn't what 99% of the country believes in. the best politician is gonna ignore belief and focus on helping EVERYONE. not just the rich (trump). not just the poor (obama). not just the oil tycoons (bush). everyone.
4775 2018-01-07 20:52:55 @Midas After being told yesterday an oil change takes an hour today I'm told it takes half an hour & an hour & a half later I'm still waiting. I think I'm going to be late for work. If the employees weren't yelling they're going to "f**k" someone up they could finish their work.
4776 2018-01-07 20:52:39 "The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they..." ~Psalms 55:21
4777 2018-01-07 20:52:33 Sorry honey the only SNL skits are T-Rump and T-Rumpsters who sound more like Jim Jones & David Koresh followers who despite all evidence to the contrary believe this lying narcissist braggart's snake oil.
4778 2018-01-07 20:52:26 Great , then we will cut off all oil and gas deliveries to the  Washington State!
4779 2018-01-07 20:52:17 (And if you have a sauté pan or similar with a lid, you can grease the bottom a bit with oil, set a pre-risen burger-sized bun on it on a medium heat and cover, and cook on the stove; transfer to the pan & cook on greaseproof paper if it's easier; flip halfway, cook 5-8min)
4780 2018-01-07 20:52:17 Eggs fried in chili oil on ciabatta. Wearing an apron to eat it as front two rows may experience some yolk splash.

4782 2018-01-07 20:52:02 Gullible are those that believe anything #DonTheCon says without investigating facts, data or statistics. Classic snake oil salesman.  If you can name one person who has used #bankruptcy as much as Trump to cheat the system I will say one good thing about him on twitter.
4783 2018-01-07 20:52:01 كانوا لا يستحقونك ، فأبعدهم الله عنك لماذا تحزن اذًا ..!
4784 2018-01-07 20:51:51 New does not seem to find the new oil.
4785 2018-01-07 20:51:42 You hound dog. Trump not an Ice Cream Seller. He is a Snake Oil Seller and Scam Artist of the Highest Order. MAGA (lol) Sing Heartbreak Hotel for us.
4786 2018-01-07 20:51:32 Like almost every other goalie in this league and something he's done throughout his career...including last season.
4787 2018-01-07 20:51:29 Pour more oil onto the engine and it’ll be good as new
4788 2018-01-07 20:51:24 Miller less than eloquently slaps the frosting on the burnt upside down cake. Trump is hardly a political genius, a good con artist and carnival snake oil salesman, yes. Anyone who doubts his instability needs a mental health checkup as well.
4789 2018-01-07 20:51:13 I know nothing, so take every grain of salt in the shaker with this, but i have heard olive oil can be good for dry hair.
4790 2018-01-07 20:51:05 Grievomax. Scotland got devolution, and smoking ban, and housung debt write-off plus all UK benefits of Lab govt inc minimum wage and tax credits. And Faslane and Rosyth as a bonus. 70s oil was an investment in UK economy as part of sharing resources. Why wouldn't we?
4791 2018-01-07 20:51:04 The Russians just found a trillion gallons of oil under the arctic circle.. this will flood the earth's oceans with oil... Not maybe... it will... Who's there to watch?
4792 2018-01-07 20:50:54

4793 2018-01-07 20:50:51 I have the Midnight Oil Tomato Feta Soup recipe and none of them know Will Humphrey:
4794 2018-01-07 20:50:48 On Thursday, the interior department released plans that would open up vast areas off the Pacific to oil and gas. But opposition from California lawmakers coupled with the fact that drilling by land is cheaper may derail the agenda #offshore #oilandgas #plans #California #pacific
4795 2018-01-07 20:50:46 Wise. Yeah I'd avoid baby oil. Oil stains can be terrible
4796 2018-01-07 20:50:44 Exfoliating ur whole body then coconut oil on after, I feel like an angel.
4797 2018-01-07 20:50:44 الغريب ان الامور التي نخاف منها ، تحدث دائما !!

4799 2018-01-07 20:50:42 uk falls 5-10% on ftse all share - ftse 100 steady even up 5-10% as dollar earners - plus oil/miners benefit chin still growing 
japan weaker yen mkts ok -china up as growth continues and devaluation of rhimbi 

alternative oil falls to 45-50 mkts up- pivot -trump /iran sanctions
4800 2018-01-07 20:50:33 Looking gorgeous! D got me the Glossier stuff for Xmas but I haven’t started it so will need to get cracking! I also use the Clarins blue orchid oil at night and it’s doing wonders for me 
4801 2018-01-07 20:50:19 Thanks. Do you sell Argan Pure Oil?

4806 2018-01-07 20:49:44 I've never been a vengeful person, but I'm not above hoping that karma helps 'oil' be the end of trump's Reign of the Ridiculous - cholesterol via KFC is always a possibility.
4807 2018-01-07 20:49:41 Of course ; off shore drills, well done, deregulation oil drilling safety
4808 2018-01-07 20:49:39 Yours more so, by your own admission Venezuela scuppered lower oil price not so other counties
4809 2018-01-07 20:49:37 Pro tip: get your oil changed right after a snow storm. I think the mechanics are just happy to have something to do.
4810 2018-01-07 20:49:27 These off shore drilling platforms have replaced over 85% of the American Oil Workers and brought in Foreign Workers.
4811 2018-01-07 20:49:20 This is the year of the apricot oil.
4812 2018-01-07 20:49:17 It's been an entertaining opening frame, which can't be said for most NHL games. So it would still be worth a watch.
4813 2018-01-07 20:49:16 Ya we should be buying overseas oil instead of piping it from Canada, cuz it’s dirty oil eh?
4814 2018-01-07 20:49:03 And they say oil and water dont mix now they all down at the beach washing off the fish

4816 2018-01-07 20:48:58 I've been there ...   getting morning deliveries of heating oil (thanks to my support contract) like old-timey milk bottles.
4817 2018-01-07 20:48:51 its very yummy. but i feel it depends on the brand too. some tend to be too dry an i can only eat it packed in water not oil.
4818 2018-01-07 20:48:46 Replace Cramer and Hoeven with people that care about AND not their personal oil wells.
4819 2018-01-07 20:48:42 Do you think that's why America go into the middle east, for oil?
4820 2018-01-07 20:48:24 chili jam sounds amazing. I routinely make homemade chili oil, would love to try my hand at the jam. Got a recipe to share?
4821 2018-01-07 20:48:22 So we all see trump and his gang turning our country in to POTTERSVILLE IN THE CLASSIC JIMMY STEWART MOVIE. Close your eyes and view pottersville in your mind. No zoning town run amuck oil and gas wells in neighborhoods.not a nice place to live. But Potter was RICH IS IT WORTH IT
4822 2018-01-07 20:48:18 African Black Soap & Argan Pure Oil
4823 2018-01-07 20:48:05 I’d say cannabis derived CBD oil contains CBD > 3% potency and likely has residual THC.  Hemp derived is likely negligible.
4824 2018-01-07 20:47:46 McDavid line was the only one looking to attack the goal with any kind of consistency.
4825 2018-01-07 20:47:39 Coconut oil/olive oil
4826 2018-01-07 20:47:36 Fish oil is the jame for dogs..
4827 2018-01-07 20:47:35 @Lee_Trades #hyr given the turnaround story here and positive EBTIA coupled with rising oil price and director purchases is double figures ludicrous? I certainly don't think so..
4828 2018-01-07 20:47:16 Ororo no be crude oil
4829 2018-01-07 20:47:12 was desperate to breathe out my nose again so I put a tiny bit of olbas oil up me nostril now I feel like I’m gunna need deviated septum surgery, fuck me 2018 just gets better nd better doesn’t it 
4830 2018-01-07 20:46:58 Post wax: tea tree oil lessened but did not nearly eliminate the burning. Vaseline has soothed by again STILL burning tremendously. 
4831 2018-01-07 20:46:47 This has been a worse case scenario to be sure but it certainly isn't pretty.
4832 2018-01-07 20:46:47 Their alpha arbutin 2% + HA has made a WORLD of a difference in my skin. I’m halfway thru my bottle and I want more lol. I want to get more marula oil nd try their rose hip oil and hylauronic acid Nd red peeling aha solution
4833 2018-01-07 20:46:43 That’s what I figured. I know the squeaky wheel gets the oil, and there’s usually a small group making the loudest noise in most places.
4834 2018-01-07 20:46:41 I don’t even need to watch his after Caps game do I??
4835 2018-01-07 20:46:19 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4836 2018-01-07 20:46:14 I have ideas that could have prevented the oil spill in the gulf of mexico from the BP oil platform...
nobody cared.
4837 2018-01-07 20:46:13 Worlds shittiest oil extractor making this oil change so slooooowwww
4838 2018-01-07 20:46:11 for a quick and easy dressing, pour the mackerel fat over the salad before adding oil and salt  #cookjan
4839 2018-01-07 20:46:09 Predictable.  Jerry Jones is a wildcatter.  He craves finding oil where others didn’t.  He remains the only consistent element of the Cowboys’ playoff and championship drought.
4840 2018-01-07 20:46:05 It is important to remember that there are a number of sociopaths in the country who actually believe and continue to believe that a lying, borderline senile snake oil salesman was a good choice for president. Remember never to let them outnumber you again, sane voter.
4841 2018-01-07 20:45:54 I wanna do something but I need my oil changed so bad I don’t wanna drive my car until I get it done lmao

4843 2018-01-07 20:45:51 I just “lotioned” my hands with anointing oil. My work gone be real blessed today.

4856 2018-01-07 20:44:00 THEY NEED TO DRILL FOR OIL, STOP THOSE TECTONIC PLATES FROM SLIDING AROUND ON ALL THAT LUBRICANT
4857 2018-01-07 20:43:55 Everything remains on the perimeter  for the Oilers in the offensive zone. This group has zero going on...lack of confidence rears its ugly head one more time.
4858 2018-01-07 20:43:41 Yes in spite of trump those figures are correct not because of him. Does he want to take credit for oil being at at a 3-year High gas prices rising home heating oil going up he wants to take credit for that too doubtful party of the Hypocrites you know pathetic
4859 2018-01-07 20:43:34 The way Ocean currents flow, Prince Rupert will see oil in about 8 months, but JT will never seek payment or speak about it.
4860 2018-01-07 20:43:27 I knew the Larsson Trade was bad and we were going to have a below average transition game again...but never did I think this .
4861 2018-01-07 20:43:25 American oil and American citizens then help the ones we can.

4864 2018-01-07 20:43:22 Oil is a boom-bust business. Always has been. Thus NDP trying to diversify. Nothing wrong with being a bus driver if it pays bills and puts food on the table. Stop insulting bus drivers who work hard.
4865 2018-01-07 20:43:21 Some blue bloods an oil to start the day 
4866 2018-01-07 20:43:17 Baked chicken! 
I use a little bit of sunflower and avocado oil in the pan then sear the chicken on all sides(after seasoning a bit) and then pop it in the oven for about 20-30 minutes at 350. I usually serve it with sautéed veggies and rice. Easy meal prep to make!
4867 2018-01-07 20:43:17 I tried to put coconut oil on my eyelashes and now I can’t see anything help
4868 2018-01-07 20:43:13 I always find olbas oil helps me and sleep sitting up a bit.
Vicks vapour rub is also good...
Cup of water with some in on a radiator evaporates through the night too..
4869 2018-01-07 20:43:11 Yeah. Beacause all first time buyers have won the fucking lottery! £320k. Who are the first time buyers? Russian Oil Barons?

4872 2018-01-07 20:42:53 @BigBird Alaska is the biggest US state, has America's tallest mountain, a big oil pipeline & was once part of the biggest country, Russia.
4873 2018-01-07 20:42:43 It's not a matter of scheduling, it's a matter of people not applying for the job. It's entry-level, they train you and pay you well. People just aren't applying. Oil rigs, shipping vessels, OTR truckers, the list goes on and on. All well-paying jobs that need people.
4874 2018-01-07 20:42:39 is not for Washington to decide the UN rejected the USA request for action on IRAN'S protest you well-underestimating people in charge in IRAN is internal matters reforms need to be put in place foreign budget needs to be reduced oil money should be spent on IRANIAN PEOPLE

4877 2018-01-07 20:42:19 You sure? A lot of these oil change shops lie to you by saying whatever liquid is suppose to be clear when most are either green or orange or even pink. Get to know the types and colour liquids your car uses. It should all be in your car manual!
4878 2018-01-07 20:42:08 well with mcap still at 20m and the company now profitable for the first time, rising oil price and license news due a mcap of 70-80m is in order for starters which is 11p :-)
4879 2018-01-07 20:42:08 Guess ill go get my oil change after all since it stop raining chile

4883 2018-01-07 20:41:51 So I made an appointment for an oil change and this price almost made me shout! LOL Shout out to @Groupon!
4884 2018-01-07 20:41:49 So I made an appointment for an oil change and this price almost made me shout! LOL Shout out to Groupon!
4885 2018-01-07 20:41:45 You have to buy oil from somewhere. Why should you buy oil drilled in the Middle East rather than from America? #Hypocrites
4886 2018-01-07 20:41:34 So just good quality chicken thighs, broccoli, cauliflower, red onion, potatoes, garlic, thyme and seasoning with olive oil and roast. Easy but beautiful with some gravy. Eat whilst watching nfl with a glass of red  #Sunday

4894 2018-01-07 20:40:05 Today has been therapeutic. I have a second essential oil diffuser and my apartment smells so good now.  I also cleaned my whole apartment and swept/mopped. Today has been a good day.
4895 2018-01-07 20:39:49 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.
4896 2018-01-07 20:39:41 Being an adult is hard. Because I know that I want a full set of Damascus blades for the kitchen but I also know that I need to pay for an extra tank of oil because New England right now

Oil Source and Use17 min

Oil Source
4901 2018-01-07 20:38:31 And Rick Perry who was also not on the guest list. Or maybe he stayed home to play with his oil wells. Or maybe he was invited, but couldn't find the place.
4902 2018-01-07 20:38:05 Isn't the military owned by oil corps?
4903 2018-01-07 20:37:59 Just a bit of advice for the Oil,   you Probly shouldn't let 88 set up shop behind the net and not challenge him in the slightest.  
#FaxMachinesSuck
4904 2018-01-07 20:37:58 Perhaps but it is my saving grace 
4905 2018-01-07 20:37:50 Fry it until you think you're gunna burn it!!!!!! Make sure to use enough oil or cooking spray etc!
4906 2018-01-07 20:37:27 Can you say same for Sudan? Albeit they had crude oil.
4907 2018-01-07 20:37:27 This, 'ye mera deewanapan' is oil to my fire of homesickness...
4908 2018-01-07 20:37:09 Nigga, I don't cook, you the chef! I'm asking, I never heard of seasoning the oil lol
4909 2018-01-07 20:37:06 @KingSalman 
There was accident  in the East China sea. It was oil ship crush. Be careful...
4910 2018-01-07 20:36:57 England, you'll have had your oil?
4911 2018-01-07 20:36:23 @OfficeGovEthics this is a direct attack of a politician from a government website -- also Oil is a commodity -- world market -- misleading to suggest politician specifically enriched Saudi Arabia or any other country
4912 2018-01-07 20:36:21 Really? World leaders have only ever been empathetic to human suffering when there is something in it for them, such as oil. Where was the empathy for Rwanda? And those victims didn't have a choice. The people in Libya, as tragic as it is, do.
4913 2018-01-07 20:36:08 doing a hot oil leave in hair treatment but the microwave hasn’t been cleaned so i can’t wait to emerge smelling like popcorn and turkey bacon
4914 2018-01-07 20:35:51 I just changed my oil and brakes on my car. And sadly that will be the highlight of my day lol

4920 2018-01-07 20:35:14 Oil is Ghana's largest export product.
4921 2018-01-07 20:34:48 I don't think it's some eastern oil billionaire with unlimited funds. The group must be quite hard up, in football-club-owning terms, at least. Well, maybe not hard up but don't have the luxury of just writing a blank cheque.
4922 2018-01-07 20:34:47 The problem is they did. Salmond said Scots would be £1000 per person better off. (Guardian, 28 May 14) lied about cost of setting up #Indy government lied abour #oil revenue lied about #currency lied about #EU etc etc etc
4923 2018-01-07 20:34:24 Energy is not electricity. Burlington needs heat from gas and oil or highest pollution wood. It’s 7F there today
4924 2018-01-07 20:34:23 I didn't think that Daesh had any oil fields/production left under their control.
4925 2018-01-07 20:34:18 My mom was like "you sure you're gonna be able to do your oil change? What if you fuck up?" 
4926 2018-01-07 20:34:17 Seriously doubt it.
4927 2018-01-07 20:34:13 Soooo the best thing for that is about 6 saltines , ginger beer . it’s good to keep dry salty foods to help prevent dry heaving .

4934 2018-01-07 20:33:12 A panda’s fur is coated with oil, which keeps the animal waterproof.
4935 2018-01-07 20:33:07 Imposing them a limit right now would have been acknowledging your willingness to keep them in precarious position. If you want to limit Iraqi oil Production, increase their reward.
4936 2018-01-07 20:32:52 If you think avocado oil is better than olive oil then your ass dumb as hell sorry bout it
4937 2018-01-07 20:32:47 No, it was the previous supply glut caused by high oil prices driving exploration. That was the one that had Albertans displaying bumper stickers promising not to piss away another oil boom. Oops.

4940 2018-01-07 20:32:34 :if you’re on a diet you can’t eat egg with yolk and you can’t cook with oil.
Andrea: I didn’t cook with oil I used butter 
4941 2018-01-07 20:32:28 They should instead be asking where did the oil sip from?
4942 2018-01-07 20:32:24 Reminds me about reading about the times of Snake oil salesmen and all the other strange stuff people would try to pass of as miracle cures, treatments or just make the individuals life easier..

4946 2018-01-07 20:31:44 Last night I made it to 11:34PM. It's 11:30 and I'm calling it once again with the Oil down 2-0. #LetsGoOilers once again becomes #LetsGoToBed. @jsbmbaggedmilk Good thing you went out and bought another can of beets! #fartnoise
4947 2018-01-07 20:31:28 If trump has a successful presidency no one will have health insurance, the oceans will be oil slicks, the rich will own eighty percent of the wealth, women won't have any reproductive choices, and the only men we'll have to choose from are wrinkly old white ones.
4948 2018-01-07 20:31:21 It was off Letestu...that's not on the goalie.
4949 2018-01-07 20:31:15 So World thinking Electrical Cars as Trump offers oil leases fir 79 millions acres! 71yrs passed Trump by and he has zero ability to see future World!
4950 2018-01-07 20:31:13 Or does higher oil imply lower USD
4951 2018-01-07 20:31:10 It’s worth a read. Continue (at end of article) into the (+ve) study on benefits of Olive Oil.

4954 2018-01-07 20:31:00 We need a CO2e (e = equivalent) tax for Main St. $50/tonne metric, increasing 10%/yr. This can be done on top of the extant CA carbon exchange. It doesn't matter how much money comes in via carbon credit exchange, but in how much CO2e is no longer created.
Or, cut oil subsidies.
4955 2018-01-07 20:30:28 Because of its location Iraqi Oil will be favored by China and other Eastern countries, furthermore due to the need of fund resulting from the "national counter terrorism effort" and the small amount of income coming from the coalition,

4957 2018-01-07 20:29:56 If North Sea Oil Revenue is being squandered by the current Scottish Government then don't support them.

Why do you think by devolving all power to them through Independence it would solve anything - even now they can't solve anything with the power they already have.

4964 2018-01-07 20:29:34 “And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.”
Matthew 25:2-4

4974 2018-01-07 20:28:36 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
4975 2018-01-07 20:28:24 Unable to celebrate any Trump job accomplishments. Rolling back protections against oil spills and drilling off coast is so sad

4990 2018-01-07 20:26:24 Looking good buddy, I look forward to seeing what you do with military science and oil processing, don’t worry about storage just let the stuff sit on the belts it will get used up soon enough.
4991 2018-01-07 20:26:21 Without good government, you get deregulation, massive tax cuts for cashing hoarding corporations ☞ Big Pharma, Big Oil..... Wall St... that just screw average citizens struggling to meet ends!
4992 2018-01-07 20:26:21 It’s more about how you cook, boil, grill and baking is better than frying & roasting. Also the type of oil...coconut is good

5030 2018-01-07 20:21:45 Huh? You’re not listening. Do a google search. It is the market that killed coal jobs not environmental regulations. Fracking, oil prices, it is not economical. She was the one trying to help those families. Come back with something constructive, please.

Been protesting this shit since '02!

Two things I have always resisted: War, and the machine known as the art establishment; I have no desire to "know the right people" or "create the right art," I will find another way
5038 2018-01-07 20:21:15 I hear through the grapevine that new offshore oil drilling will start first off the coast of Florida right in front of Mar-a-lago. Also any overflow or spills will be available for free collections-first come first served basis! Thank you #45! #FBR @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
5039 2018-01-07 20:21:11 I used plain witch hazel with drops of tea tree oil. Makes a big difference. I love it.
5040 2018-01-07 20:20:55 Y’all be dumping all that oil on there cuz y’all ain’t got no pull wit aki for extra meat pause lol
5041 2018-01-07 20:20:54 “Fresh cut potatoes cooked in 100% peanut oil”
5042 2018-01-07 20:20:52 martha stewart but it was Oii and not Oil
5043 2018-01-07 20:20:49 Snake oil salesmen know no income levels. They target anyone stupid enough to believe them or ignorant to science.
5044 2018-01-07 20:20:44 hi i’m kyia and i am addicted to coconut oil
5045 2018-01-07 20:20:41 Come on mate get real US have got their noses in everyone's business do you think they would have even bothered with the M East if no oil was involved they are modern day equivalent of Brit Empire only even worse if that's even possible.
5046 2018-01-07 20:20:33 Hmm... I didn't expect black garlic oil to be so sweet.
5047 2018-01-07 20:20:32 What is the source of the first table?
I've seen neem oil listed as highly toxic elsewhere.
A criticism I get quite regularly is: "You're wrong again. Rotenone has been removed from the list (every couple years it seems). Therefore I can ignore your list!"
5048 2018-01-07 20:20:30 Venezuela has the biggest oil reserves in the world mate...
5049 2018-01-07 20:20:28 TE who caught it is from by me. Oil City, PA. Played at ND
5050 2018-01-07 20:20:16 Yes
I say by 2070
Many ppl won't be able work outdoors
Too hot
We need cut oil play out
Reduce dependence petrochemical fertilizers 
Methane
5051 2018-01-07 20:20:15 Only that KRG is really behind in transparency compared to the rest of the country, or not? Bank accounts holding billions of oil money who even KRG ministers don’t know about; hundreds of thousands of ghosts employees and even half a million non-existing voters. Priorities?
5052 2018-01-07 20:19:47 Not before time.
Pay particular attention to the Syrian element of the Qatari oil pipeline. 
5053 2018-01-07 20:19:47 That's One Fine booty also the oil on the booty even better
5054 2018-01-07 20:19:43 My man is getting my lashes done, my best friend changed my oil and washed my car, my manager bought me lunch. Today’s a good day 
5055 2018-01-07 20:19:36 The same reason it was made illegal, money. Cannabis & hemp were made illegal because they were going to make a lot of people invested in forest, oil & cotton industries lose money. It won't be legalized till those who keep it illegal will profit the most
5056 2018-01-07 20:19:36 Shot for the first time in over a year. Red dot scope no batteries on the AR and the Beretta needs some oil. Slow cycle rate.
5057 2018-01-07 20:19:34 ولنا في الخيال .. حياة أجمل
5058 2018-01-07 20:19:22 In order to see where government control of all things ends up, look at today's Venezuela. World's largest proven reserves of oil, and it's broke and completely disfunctional. Margaret Thatcher knew: You run out of "other people's money" no matter how well meaning you are.

5061 2018-01-07 20:19:09  You could probably change the oil too!
5062 2018-01-07 20:18:59 Crude oil done finish?
5063 2018-01-07 20:18:59 I need to take a bath in my de-stess essential oil. 5 drops isn’t doing it for me right now.
5064 2018-01-07 20:18:54 Actually, as a resident of WA I’m not against offshore drilling. Can it be done safely? Will it help us not have to import oil from the Middle East/Russia? Let’s not dismiss things just because a Party playbook says to. Is there a compromise in here anywhere?
5065 2018-01-07 20:18:47 It’s not Christian to have a hard heart to refugees. 

The strife in the middle east is due to a century of western meddling for control of oil. So beyond basic humanitarianism it is our responsibility to do all we can for these suffering people.
5066 2018-01-07 20:18:43 I mean Sainsbury’s AND olive oil! ... I’m a million miles away from Iceland frozen curry now like
5067 2018-01-07 20:18:39 Falsehoods are the stock & trade of the Democratic Party. When all you have to pedal is dangerous snake oil, you don’t want your audience looking at real medicine.
5068 2018-01-07 20:18:26 Didn't watch the Dallas feed yesterday and was unaware he shifted over. Not surprised he's excelling at it, has been one of the best colour-guys in the business for some time.
5069 2018-01-07 20:18:25 I could sleep oil day on my off day
5070 2018-01-07 20:18:20 They use peanut oil for everything and they just a lot left over 
5071 2018-01-07 20:18:18 Use coconut oil
5072 2018-01-07 20:18:18 Yep, your man was slick as a oil. Just watch the interview and I got the feeling he was nervous he was twitchy and he look like a man who been coach badly

5076 2018-01-07 20:17:55 A Trifecta of Majors now playing hard in Shale. This is VERY bullish for oil medium to long term. Marathon runners don’t make good sprinters
5077 2018-01-07 20:17:32 I think thinner slices, less oil, longer cooking time and lower temp will help. This is the first time I've made them so they aren't too bad but I think that's what I'll try next time
5078 2018-01-07 20:16:57 Ben Koyack. Oil City, Pa.
5079 2018-01-07 20:16:38 That's why if a private event in a club baby oil is on toilet lids etc. Stops people snorting as it congeals the drugs - had a few people complain  
5080 2018-01-07 20:16:11 Today my hubby just the kitchen pop oil it's was dangerous but funny same time.
5081 2018-01-07 20:15:59 coconut oil, sugar, lemon extract = bomb exfoliant 
5082 2018-01-07 20:15:59 So: get real. There’s two trophies worth winning, and there are 3 major oil clubs (not to mention Real, Bayern & Barca) to fight for them. Any project to beat them will not be overnight.
5083 2018-01-07 20:15:58 No...in my head I seen you rubbing some sort of fragrant oil into your bare thi....oh never mind
5084 2018-01-07 20:15:52 I was on Lyrica for fibromyalgia but it stopped working and I gained back 20lbs I lost when I first moved to Hawaii. Lost 10lbs since going off it in October 2017. #CBD oil works better once I can find what I can afford.
5085 2018-01-07 20:15:50 Ran out of oil last night also on automated delivery, was put on hol for 30 minutes 6 times, still no answer and mo oil my pipes are freezing.... Gonna cancel my contract and sue them if they try to charge me the cancellation fee!!!!
5086 2018-01-07 20:15:46 Blend 2 tablespoons chick peas with 2 tablespoons bluefish. Mix into  Olive Oil. Allow to harden Serve with salmon
5087 2018-01-07 20:15:29 'All of Iraq' indeed means all of Iraq incl the KRI. All oil money belongs to all Iraqi citizens, no? Full transparency would benefit all.
5088 2018-01-07 20:15:24 Putin knew Hillary could be bought cheap. Only an idiot thinks Putin wanted Trump to win.
Russian economy is heavily dependent on oil. Hillary would have further restricted development of our natural resources. Trump has expanded it. The former helps Russia. The latter harms them
5089 2018-01-07 20:15:23 Heck of a play from an Oil City guy! #koyak!

5092 2018-01-07 20:15:08 Jags TE Ben Koyak is from Oil City
5093 2018-01-07 20:15:07 Oil City grad and @Jaguars tight end Ben Koyack with the play of the game so far today scoring a 1-yard touchdown on 4th and goal. Jacksonville leads @buffalobills 10-3 late in the 3rd quarter.

5095 2018-01-07 20:14:47 Reaugh does the P x P now since the passing of Dave Strader.  He does a great job at it, just as he did with the color commentary.
5096 2018-01-07 20:14:46 Neat to see a kid from Oil City catching NFL TDs
5097 2018-01-07 20:14:41 Actually, Fresh Cream mixed with another oil or fragrance is the cheat code. It's heavenly.
5098 2018-01-07 20:14:37 Oil City’s own ... Ben Koyack!!!
5099 2018-01-07 20:14:30 2018: the year essential oils have taken over my life. Oil diffuser, lotions, body wash, hand oils. What have I been missing for the last 24 years.
5100 2018-01-07 20:14:26 good moisturiser or oil thing for dry skin ???

5102 2018-01-07 20:14:19 I agree with all you’re saying. However, the book is out on the Oil this season, and the deep-pucks game. Teams have been containing our F’s, so we’ve resorted to getting any shots we can. Nowhere is that more evident than our PP. We aren’t a good puck carrying team this year.
5103 2018-01-07 20:14:16 Ben Koyak from Notre Dame & Oil City, PA for all of you Bills fans!!
5104 2018-01-07 20:14:14 FINALLY getting an oil change  I should be ashamed of myself 
5105 2018-01-07 20:14:06 Oil City's own Ben Koyack just scored for the Jaguars in the NFL Playoffs.
5106 2018-01-07 20:13:53 @TomiLahren @henryolsenEPPC & @cbellantoni on tonight's panel!

And- should sanc city pols be prosecuted? @SteveHiltonx tonight on #NextRevFNC at 9EST on FNC!
5107 2018-01-07 20:13:51 Oil City’s own, Ben Koyack with the TD!

5111 2018-01-07 20:13:45 trend started before 2015 election. Oil was $115 per barrel in August 2013. Under $60 per barrel in mid December 2014. 

May 2015, Prentice loses election. Slide continues, Oil bottomed at $32 per barrel January 2016

Capex started leaving with the big price losses of 2014 #ableg
5112 2018-01-07 20:13:44 The fake news should go drill the oil for U.S. supplies!
5113 2018-01-07 20:13:28 I should have injected one litre of holy water or anointing oil to my niece's body instead of giving them vaccines.
5114 2018-01-07 20:13:19 I hate Oil City
5115 2018-01-07 20:13:12 Ben Koyack with the go ahead score for jags, The Oil City product.
5116 2018-01-07 20:13:10 Oil City represent.
5117 2018-01-07 20:13:09 It was good deffo an experience. If I had travelled with a man there would have been  less/no harassment from the stall owners. The breakfast was simple and delish. Had THEE best Hamam massage experience of my life. Climbed a waterfall, saw how almond oil is made, rode camels

5120 2018-01-07 20:13:02 Leave it to a guy from Oil City, PA to finally score a TD in this game. Congratulations, Ben Koyack.
5121 2018-01-07 20:12:55 I say YES YES YES!  MORE OIL MORE PIPELINES  MORE COAL more wind more sun  more water ... ANYTHING REASONABLE THAT CREATES MORE JOBS!! Yea POTUS TRUMP!!!
5122 2018-01-07 20:12:52 He will give licenses for exploration in many offshore areas that Obama did not allow to be explored. After 10 years the world will be flooded with US oil ,the environment will pay a heavy price and the oil value will colapse.
5123 2018-01-07 20:12:46 Ben Koyack from Oil City lmao

5133 2018-01-07 20:12:13 Ben Koyack, the pride of Oil City, PA
5134 2018-01-07 20:12:09 It's not new, it's just a lot more expensive. You need to use less of it each time and it lasts longer because it's more oil, less alcohol  (which evaporates) but the cost puts people off buying it.
5135 2018-01-07 20:12:08 this is kinda weird, but my dad (in seattle) will give his dogs sardines - high source of vitamin d and also the fish oil is good for older dogs joints
5136 2018-01-07 20:12:07 Oil City's Ben Koyack with the TD catch. Might have been juggling.
5137 2018-01-07 20:11:53 I'm trying my best not to hurt you Earth-chan I recycle and sing petitions to help stop off shore oil drilling.
5138 2018-01-07 20:11:48 I think @ReynoldsWrap non-stick foil is highly underrated. It’s so useful, especially for someone who tries to use little oil. PLUS you can reuse and utilize it a few times if you are careful. Yup I reuse my foil.
5139 2018-01-07 20:11:43 Burning the midnight oil 
5140 2018-01-07 20:11:37 I love the smell of coconut oil in my hair. #attitudeofgratitude
5141 2018-01-07 20:11:34 Need to keep oil /gas drilling 125 miles from any shoreline.
5142 2018-01-07 20:11:06 Super easy! 1/3 raw shea 1/4 coco oil Raven, Eucalyptus Radiata, Copaiba, Frank, Peppermint, Lemon and Thieves EOs. Melt coco and sheaand blend all together and wait for it to solidify. I put it in a mason jar
5143 2018-01-07 20:11:03 And the  stays in the pockets of Big Oil while taxpayers pay for the cleanup. Bigly sad, yugely wrong.

5148 2018-01-07 20:10:27 So much for the US minding its own business. Does Iran have oil and is it located in a strategic geographical location and also hated by Israel? Yes but this is about freedom and democracy??

5160 2018-01-07 20:08:35 Watched Deepwater horizon with baby girl last night and it was one of the best movies I’ve ever seen. You get a picture of how the oil industry is and the risks people take to support a family and themselves.
5161 2018-01-07 20:08:35 It's from the editors notes on Polio Oil On My Anus's 'Book'
5162 2018-01-07 20:08:26 Always good to hear Eddie.
5163 2018-01-07 20:08:26 IS this bacteria BC of Human pollution? Raw sewage? Or the Oil seepage from dead oil wells?
5164 2018-01-07 20:08:24 And I still want to know where the billions from KRG oil are disappearing. If knowing Iraq’s finances is governance, then figuring out KRG finances is knowing where governance is failing and Iraq’s sovereignty is undermined.
5165 2018-01-07 20:08:18 I just kind of invented it! Roasted a sweet potatoes and a tin of chickpeas in the oven for 45 mins, both covered in Moroccan spices, a grind from my precious chipotle chilli grinder & some salt & olive oil, then when done mixed them up with
5166 2018-01-07 20:08:09 Coconut oil and my favorite body moisturizer
5167 2018-01-07 20:08:09 Here's the game plan:
Go in
Get coconut oil
Get out

But I'm starving tho so, we'll see 
5168 2018-01-07 20:08:06 I feel your pain. I've actually had a far worse experience, that I may someday I'll share... at an Oilers home game in Rexall! Needless to say the Leafs were in town and the Oil got stomped.
5169 2018-01-07 20:08:01 You forgot about Mr Caggiula...who has been given more opportunity than most and done little with it.
5170 2018-01-07 20:08:01 I need to get some vitamin E oil
5171 2018-01-07 20:07:46 Dallas crew was good yesterday. Those guys are pretty even-handed.
5172 2018-01-07 20:07:45 Coconut oil will moisturize without hurting in the cracked areas. If the pain is bad, apply Neosporin and bandages at night, then moisturize. Gold Bond Hand Eczema is wonderfum whether you have exzema or not.

5174 2018-01-07 20:07:43 If I live to be 100, I'm going to be so pissed... I'm like a car with 300000 miles that's never had an oil change.
5175 2018-01-07 20:07:39 Cleaned bike oil out of the carpet using only washing up liquid and water. Also quelled the anxiety/shame from my landlady telling me off for it.

nb. I was going to clean it anyway, but as it's still suuuuuper wet and muddy outside there didn't seem to be much point yet
5176 2018-01-07 20:07:13 ive used brown sugar & honey. haven’t thought to add almond oil, thanks!
5177 2018-01-07 20:06:53 I'm going to go on a limb and say that it's because Venezuela doesn't represent a strategic position anywhere near any significant oil deposits.
5178 2018-01-07 20:06:44 They probably didn’t change the oil recently which sounds dumb bc like that’s their job but you know

5182 2018-01-07 20:06:16 Did he take retinol form of Vit A too? (As in cod liver oil not synthetic retinyl palmitate.) Viruses and fevers tank your Vit A storage. Most modern diets are absurdly low to begin with. 
We do whole food C for daily use and reserve synthetic big guns like liposomal for sickness

5208 2018-01-07 20:03:14 First we should be more worried about homeless and starving in our state then fix immigration challenges first? U make no sense. Do you know how many PEOPLE were impacted by the BP oil spill?It's not just wildlife, it's not just environment and immigration has nothing do to w/it

Thanks.
5241 2018-01-07 20:00:16 no it isn't ... that is another lie brought to you by the oil and gas industry and the lumbering ICE car industry ... most people charge their cars at NIGHT in off peak hours when there is plenty of capacity going to waste ...

5245 2018-01-07 19:59:59 My grandma was talking about an oil and gas company and said, "I don't think they do drilling, I think they do gathering" and I am so offended. Gathering? I thought I taught her better than this as a petroleum engineering major.
5246 2018-01-07 19:59:57 Actually the west influenced the toppling of Shah go read about Khomeini's BBC propaganda hour back then and how it made him a national Iranian hero. Western powers wanted Shah out he was manipulating the Oil market he crossed the line in their book.

5270 2018-01-07 19:56:33 Just use it in moderation and don’t leave it on for long. For dark marks use lemon oil and Shea butter. Rub the Shea butter on your hands then put a couple of drops of the oil on to your hands.
5271 2018-01-07 19:56:29 चूतिये तेरे ही account 317 आता होगा 250 से ज्यादा तो किसी और में तो कभी आया नही । और केवल यही एक नही है ऐसे ही कई काम हैं जिसमे तुम्हारी मारी जा रही है पर तुमको आंनद आ रहा है। Crude oil का दाम  इंटरनॅशनल मार्केट में गिरा है फिर भी यहाँ दाम में अंतर ना के बराबर ।

5279 2018-01-07 19:55:23 Best thing about the secret oil fields was the notion that, if they existed, and if David Cameron had wanted to keep them secret, he would have paid them an unnecessary visit mid-referendum campaign.
5280 2018-01-07 19:55:14 Your a liar there was no WMDs as Saddam had complied with UN resolutions.The inspectors said he had none and the case for war was false as both America and Britain lied to their peoples.6 oil companies signed deals with American puppet in Iraq and they gave Iraq 40% of revenue?!!

5316 2018-01-07 19:51:38 The US is a Kleptocracy which hasn’t got draconian sanctions enforced on it because it won’t hand over its oil to western interests.
5317 2018-01-07 19:51:28 There's a sriracha chili oil I get that absolutely blasts things with flavor. I'd recommend any variant, personally.
5318 2018-01-07 19:51:23 When clove oil tastes like ass but it's the only thing to sooth my wisdom teeth 
5319 2018-01-07 19:51:19 (Almost) Everything tastes better with a bit of olive oil and some spices ;d
5320 2018-01-07 19:51:16 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
5321 2018-01-07 19:51:11 Ohhhh gotcha. I have problems with Pencil control on the slick glass sometimes, especially when my oily fingers get oil on the screen :/
5322 2018-01-07 19:50:48 E W HE'S PURPOSELY SPEWING OIL ALL OVER VINCENT'S HEAD WHILE S TILL BITING HIM.

OOPS.
5323 2018-01-07 19:50:38 Oil is the key to North Korea and it is to Iran and Russia as well. We all love Washington State and its natural beauty. Nobody wants it destroyed. But, we have to fight for freedom. Reasonable risks must be taken. They always had to be. Be a real US Senator. Oil,or lives? Think!
5324 2018-01-07 19:50:38 ก็เข้าทวิตมาเพราะว่าจะมาส่องหนิ รู้หรอก
5325 2018-01-07 19:50:36 FACT: O SLEEPY EPHRAIM WAS OBAMBOOZLED BY FLIMFLAMMING SNAKE OIL (TELEPROMPTER) ORATORY IN BARYTONE AN' THEN HOMO HOAXED UNBEKNOWNST FROM BEHIND HIS PRONE BACK WHILE HE WAS WANTONLY SPIED ON BY THE KEN'  TAUPE HALF-CRACK' HEAD ACORN WITH BLACK TRANNY, OBAMA BARACK!
5326 2018-01-07 19:50:31 Simple oil of cloves...
5327 2018-01-07 19:50:20 I using a lot of coconut oil brother. Like twice a day.
5328 2018-01-07 19:49:42 Oil tankers are not small!! Need to focus on who bought it; manage and control the purchase of illegal oil and  can control the corruption.
5329 2018-01-07 19:49:12 Must pay attention! 
Just accidentally sloshed vodka on me oven roasted vegetables instead of olive oil. I'll let you know how they taste.
#VegesRussianStyleAnyone?
5330 2018-01-07 19:49:07 The question now is; who owned all those refineries that our crude oil are being refined?When shallwe ready tostand on feet?
5331 2018-01-07 19:49:04 Can you rub coconut oil on your feelings to help fix them? Does that work? Asking for a friend
5332 2018-01-07 19:49:00 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
5333 2018-01-07 19:48:51 I am thinking of the grandchildren's futures, not oil. Increasing exports and govt subsidies for this industry can't go forward.  Replacing pipelines with safer pipelines is ok & current production but that's all. We might find a safe use for oil someday.
5334 2018-01-07 19:48:32 No oil of lavender or elephant garlic?? You are living dangerously! Best of luck @goldenglobes . You are the winner to us.
5335 2018-01-07 19:48:18 the fact he flaunts it and also the fact he is against the pipeline for one reason so he can make money off of unsafe oil travel on his railways shows he's a hypocrite and liar. no respect for him
5336 2018-01-07 19:48:12 Just wanna thank @Kailuna__ for getting me hip to hip to bio oil it works so good
5337 2018-01-07 19:47:37 witch hazel and tea tree oil.
5338 2018-01-07 19:47:05 Tv's licensed sounds odd in my ears. Where are our gold, diamonds, bauxite, manganese, oil and other mineral deposits?hmmm!
5339 2018-01-07 19:47:03 It’s only 11:45 and Mak and I have already cleaned our whole house, changed our faucet heads, organized every drawer, and changed our oil #pplwhogetshitdone
5340 2018-01-07 19:46:58 Less nut butter, more actual nuts; less granola bars, more oatmeal & whole grains; less candy, more fruit, etc. requires cutting out some easy processed foods that use palm oil as a sweetening ingredient
5341 2018-01-07 19:46:56 Not too bad today just cold and clear. Had a free electric Sunday today from 9 to 5. Had the oil filled heater on. All the washing done and dried in the tumble dryer and even made a loaf. And cuddled up with Ebony and a hotty on the sofa
5342 2018-01-07 19:46:52 Flushing oil ran through Car , new filter & oil .. wow whaddya know it’s sounding a lot quieter .. not quite a rolls Royce yet think it needs more flushing will do it in 1500 mile / 12 month periods until it’s clean as a new pin .
5343 2018-01-07 19:46:38 I think we should see if there is oil out there before we get all worried about what it will do to the coastal areas. How much is out there? Let's find out.
5344 2018-01-07 19:46:37 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
5345 2018-01-07 19:46:22 Israel...the only middle east nation with totally no oil resources (per #goldaM)
Thanks a lot, Moses
5346 2018-01-07 19:46:20 i shaved my legs w baby oil gel .. 9/10
5347 2018-01-07 19:46:13 "Notley I want you to tell me right now: 5 reasons while you love the oil sands."
"No I will not give the moderators mic back I want to hear you say I love the oil sands."
5348 2018-01-07 19:46:08 Oil up and hit the gym with me is the one I like out of these and that's a really good game is my favorite
5349 2018-01-07 19:46:07 Filemon is bought out by the oil industry. He votes no on a lot of reform bills. I encourage you to look at his voting record and donations.
5350 2018-01-07 19:46:00 For balance, I do too. But govt policy needs to balance this kind of consumer tax with pressure on manufacturers (e.g. microbeads, palm oil, parabens, particulates...).
5351 2018-01-07 19:45:59 Stove caught fire for a bit lol. Some oil dropped into my burner and woosh. Nothing major
5352 2018-01-07 19:45:54 As OR AG, I would criminally prosecute any oil CEO who lawlessly damaged our natural beauty, not sue the feds to block economic development. Vigorous enforcement is the answer, not forcing drilling to countries which don't have environmental protections.

#WhoIsEllenProtecting?
5353 2018-01-07 19:45:47 You’re spot on. Not one new idea, even though the big oil idea’s gone.
5354 2018-01-07 19:45:42 Prediction:
4-2 oilers 
Mcdavid 3pts 1G 2A
Lucic fight 

Let’s go oil.
5355 2018-01-07 19:45:36 A Chinese freighter just collided with an Iranian tanker carrying 1MM barrels of oil.  I’m sure they’ll spend at least $3.00 cleaning this.
5356 2018-01-07 19:45:33 "Hey Ken, can I deep fry some chicken in olive oil?"  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! Don't make me slap you!
5357 2018-01-07 19:45:31 El gas Oil subió xq el precio internacional del petróleo creció un 20% .... el productor de frutas Del Valle debe crear un sistema de comercialización eficiente. Pago en Tigre ( bs as) 2,5 dólares el kg de manzana.. horrible o pera verde
5358 2018-01-07 19:45:26 I have done my DD and that's why I choose not to be involved in a company that Lenigas is involved with. His past involvement with junior UK oil co's is controversial and he has a bad history of promoting companies like this. Why assume known risks in this crazy market.
5359 2018-01-07 19:45:11 Ginger or peppermint essential oil
5360 2018-01-07 19:44:54 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
5361 2018-01-07 19:44:44 Decent person can just pray & cry & still @antonioguterres continues as if none of this is #HappeningNow - killing innocent citizens, children, farmers for #oil - be ashamed #Shell #UK #EU in this day and age...all you prove is own incompetence  @realDonaldTrump @UN_PGA
5362 2018-01-07 19:44:21 Isn't that what Judas said about the anointing oil poured on Jesus' head before his betrayal and crucifixion?
5363 2018-01-07 19:44:17 I always use oil on my ends. Stay away from the top so it doesn't look greasy. You can use it on damp or dry hair. A little goes a long way.
5364 2018-01-07 19:44:03 I feel so terrible rn. I don't even feel like seeing his face. I just want to throw hot oil in his face 
5365 2018-01-07 19:43:56 I would love to know where all the oil money is coming from and going. That's governance logic.
5366 2018-01-07 19:43:54 ...Shale Oil Production should increase significantly with all safeguard roadblocks removed. Numerous states legislation prohibit people from suing Oil companies for personal and property damages caused by fracking.
5367 2018-01-07 19:43:53 425 degrees fresh oil for 10-12 minutes is key
5368 2018-01-07 19:43:52 Coconut oil & water 
5369 2018-01-07 19:43:47 Billions of dollars in deals between Iran, France and Russia for Iranian oil and French Airbus planes.  Laughable self righteousness!  Of course they want the Iranian dictators to survive!  Human rights interest = 0
5370 2018-01-07 19:43:47 soak them in Olive Oil! I dont know if that works but Im helping them smell delicious
5371 2018-01-07 19:43:40 I really need to go to Walmart so I can get some more oil for my hair 
5372 2018-01-07 19:43:38 Oil based white sharpie paint pen, or snearkerEr pen but that gives a more chalky finish. Hope that helps.
5373 2018-01-07 19:43:31 Maybe @BenGoldey can explain this. Or is the simplest explanation the correct one? Ben is beholden to Oil?
5374 2018-01-07 19:43:28 Tea tree oil is a miracle 
5375 2018-01-07 19:43:22 Again, your right but don't turn what I've said to suit your position. Imo, Chiarelli deserves a large chunk of the blame but at no point have I suggested it was just on him. What I've said on countless occasions is the GM put these players in a tough spot w/ his decisions.
5376 2018-01-07 19:43:18 I got an essential oil/water diffuser & I’ve been entertained looking at the water vapor for way longer than I’d like to admit.

5380 2018-01-07 19:43:04 I have a lecture to deliver on fats and oil. Very interesting topic.
5381 2018-01-07 19:42:36 Yeah you and tv's and PC are like water and oil lol. I never had the issues you did with the TV, even when I used a tv as a display!
5382 2018-01-07 19:42:05 @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow Republicans: VERY limited gov't EXCEPT when it comes to marijuana, Oil drilling, Oh and sanctuary cities!
5383 2018-01-07 19:42:00 Oilers gonna Oil
5384 2018-01-07 19:41:51 Castor oil had done miracles for my brows they're so nice and full now
5385 2018-01-07 19:41:25 It's so easy to heal my nose piercing with tea tree oil and salty water. I wish the other stuff in my life was this easy to heal
5386 2018-01-07 19:41:12 As I have said in the past Rob. I am sure you are an awesome guy. However you and I see things differently when it comes to the Oilers. Which is fine, as u say we are entitled to our own opinions. Cheers to you
5387 2018-01-07 19:40:42 If you have any lavender essential oil, it will help it heal
5388 2018-01-07 19:40:40 Celltone tissue oil 
5389 2018-01-07 19:40:38 Shit I make my money, for all you need to know I'm broke  I don't talk my money with others. But I know for a fact you ain't makin more than electricians or people in the oil field are your age wearing carhartt 
5390 2018-01-07 19:40:29 That’s right Senator, give those jobs and that economy to soneone else. Give it to our enemies. Fund Russia and Iran. Trump may not be keeping the oil we could have after the Iraq war that funded ISIS, but he is going to hurt our oil rich enemies with market forces. Watch Russia.
5391 2018-01-07 19:40:23 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
5392 2018-01-07 19:40:22 You do?
And yes we are. WM practically gave away oil licenses to their business pals. WM still let oil companies away with murder (and taxes). No oil fund. In fact - is there anything to show for the countless billions in Scottish revenues sent south?
5393 2018-01-07 19:40:19 Note the classic Robot-Neck-Twitch during Stephen Miller's Projectile Lying. He forgot to oil that cog. Sad.

5396 2018-01-07 19:40:02 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
5397 2018-01-07 19:39:41 Yall... Randal got me two different essential oil diffusers and I'm stooooooooked 
5398 2018-01-07 19:39:33 Nope I do not think it is from lack of effort at all. However I have a  feeling where u point the blame and that's on Chiarelli. Due to the fact that imo, this is the fault of everyone in the organization and not just Chiarelli. I choose not to read
5399 2018-01-07 19:39:29 Ahhhhhjsjshdhd I already spend like $50 on my current peel and I buy Sunday Riley oil which is a million dollars so I just want one amazing product and have heard this is the one 
5400 2018-01-07 19:39:28 Exactly. Opening U.S. coastal waters and Alaska Wilderness for oil drilling is devastating - for any chance to prevent the worst effects of climate change.
Gutting EPA and denying climate science just makes us criminals in the world community.

But her emails!!!!
5401 2018-01-07 19:39:22 All about self care sunday today! Prepped for the week followed by bath, moisturised, facial oil, pj and telly #SelfCareSunday
5402 2018-01-07 19:39:21 #Canada has a resource to export.  It is the Canadian governments responsibility to make sure that happens.  World oil usage has NEVER decreased.  Canadians are loosing out on market share, taxes and jobs because of it. #cdnpoli #pnpcbc
5403 2018-01-07 19:38:59 Would you care to explain how exporting oil gives us energy "independence"?   Further, what good is energy independence when we are killing the planet in the process?
5404 2018-01-07 19:38:49 My mother in law tried to fill her car with oil through the dip stick hole
5405 2018-01-07 19:38:49 good ideas! i like to use oil in cakes instead of eggs : )
5406 2018-01-07 19:38:48 That moment in worship, everyone’s hands go up, and who’s wearing pachouli oil becomes much more apparent.
5407 2018-01-07 19:38:40 In Spain it is called simply night of Three kings. It is a shame that it isn’t celebrated more here in UK. I always give Frankinscence oil, it is so medicinal and seems fitting somehow.
5408 2018-01-07 19:38:36 But they defo won’t do that ... profit over people rules the world  We gotta stop #coal for good and use wind, water & solar power only - use the #oil we already have, it’s crazy we have billions of barrels in reserve. #climate
5409 2018-01-07 19:38:33 I suspect UK was suffering from Dutch Disease from oil & finance, resulting in too high currency at exact time China was getting going…
5410 2018-01-07 19:38:33 So realistically:
- need to win virtually all games against those teams
- cheer against them at all opportunities
- if they play each other, hope for a 2 point game

Chances are slim to none, but I won't throw in the towel til the math says there's no longer a towel to throw!

5415 2018-01-07 19:38:06 1 - we don’t depend on it (oil & prices)
2 - fluctuate yes . The trend is upwards.
3 - strangely Unionists weren’t so hot in points 1 &2 when prices fell.
4 - you miss the point about the conspiratorial political and media silence
5416 2018-01-07 19:38:01 Woot endo! ;) CBD oil is great. When younger I was a pot head but the reality is the more you smoke the less it helps imo. I can smoke once in awhile and have it assist PTSD. Constantly and I'm a zombie. I tend to seek other methods now for that. Being high or drunk is meh.
5417 2018-01-07 19:37:58 LOL.  Ours is 100 years old, 3 layers of brick, no insulation though hopefully installing some next summer. Heat mainly with wood, oil backup. Electric heat Yikes.
5418 2018-01-07 19:37:25 Live in an oil/farming community...more SJW types in the bigger cities and closer to the mountains than I am.

5420 2018-01-07 19:37:17 Sorry Clariss, but this a “my button is bigger than your button” logic. We want to know where the billions of oil money from KRG is going instead of paying salaries. At least ruling in Baghdad is not a family business.
5421 2018-01-07 19:37:04 Really feel like laying in my clean room with my oil diffuser going, as I read... but I can’t decide whether to read my bible or 50 shades Freed lol
5422 2018-01-07 19:36:53 Really, the critical games are against the Western conference wildcard teams at this point (not catching the PacDiv leaders now). That means: DAL, COL, MIN, ANA, CGY, CHI.  Realistically probably not DAL at this point
5423 2018-01-07 19:36:48 Castor oil got my skin glowing
5424 2018-01-07 19:36:46 aside from the offshore oil boom years with high petroleum prices, it has always been like that in this province. Our economy has always been resource based. We are poorly located geographically for most manufacturing. Ppl have historically had to find work out of province
5425 2018-01-07 19:36:35 In theory, D system vests too much power on D president. Why is our @NGRPresident helpless in dislodging cabals and cartelsin the oil sector
5426 2018-01-07 19:36:22 The detox oil is the most versatile product!! I use it after getting tattoos, bug repellent for me & my dogs, & the scent is exhilarating on a rough Monday morning. Thank you @arbonne for creating products gentle enough for babies & puppies!!
5427 2018-01-07 19:36:17 We don't want pump price increase, we don't subsidy, u think that's an unrealistic and unachievable wish. Even when Nigeria owns it's own refineries, pump prices will increase from time to time depending on crude oil prices #PoliticsToday
5428 2018-01-07 19:36:05 Yum. Tartrazine. From coal oil. Yum.
5429 2018-01-07 19:35:40 @stadlerform #happytohelp Jasmine: my diffuser doesn’t s em to put our scent even with more quality oil. SOS
5430 2018-01-07 19:35:24 I’m glad it’s fixed we had to wait 24 hours for the oil company to get to us!! Yes I remember that pain trying to wash my hands
5431 2018-01-07 19:35:09 I always forget to get coconut oil when I go to the store.

olive oil, for frying
5434 2018-01-07 19:34:47 Me: deliberately buys oil-free moisturizer
Also me: adds drops of face oil to each scoop of moisturizer
5435 2018-01-07 19:34:28 Moreover, the USA has tremendous energy resources (oil, nat gas, coal) that we should explore fully for the benefit of our economy and people. This is very different from Europe where a gallon of gas costs $10. So, get real, get smart, do not recite what the others chant. #MAGA
5436 2018-01-07 19:33:42 @KathiMaheshh Take some rusted rod .. put some oil or Grease such dat it is shinny and smooth .. turn it sideways and stick it straight up to ur ass and sleep .
5437 2018-01-07 19:33:40 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?
5438 2018-01-07 19:33:17 Hey, #Croydon I'm looking for venues where I can run my essential oil classes on Saturday or Sunday mornings. Nothing too big or fancy Thank you #Cronx
5439 2018-01-07 19:33:14 The NNPC is just a market of organised thieves. They're not helping the masses. Until we start refining crude oil we will still experience fuel sabotage and price hikes. @channelstv
5440 2018-01-07 19:33:14 carina and i BOTH forgot toothbrushes/paste and are eating avacodo oil and sea salt chips for breakfast who let us go out alone
5441 2018-01-07 19:33:09 Sure, but a good chunk of his career has been Top 6 (even though we’ll surely agree, the results of those minutes have not matched his position in the lineup).

5443 2018-01-07 19:32:57 I think I learned how to make pizza dough. double 00 flour, baking powder, salt, water, olive oil and cold beer. (omit the yeast, it is annoying)
5444 2018-01-07 19:32:57 #Kojjamunda #Kathimahesh. . both are same ?? No nah .. then what u had too. . take some rod .. put some oil such dat it is shinny and smooth .. turn it sideways and stick it straight up to ur ass and sleep .
5445 2018-01-07 19:32:26 If y’all use garlic, skip buying garlic powder and get a fresh bulb of it. Raw garlic is a bit more potent than powder. You can also roast it (cut off the top, sit it in a square of foil, pour a cap of olive oil on it, twist up the foil, let it bake ~20-30 at 350). Lasts a while
5446 2018-01-07 19:32:22 Everyone supports oil drilling, but over there, not near me.

5451 2018-01-07 19:31:14 My 88 yr old aunt in assisted living uses cannabis oil edibles. She has a lot of pain from osteoporosis and has been wheelchair bound for almost 5 years. My cousin told me that most of the folks there us edibles.

5453 2018-01-07 19:31:02 Evidence also showed that much of the oil was dissipated into the ocean floor. Did you know that?
5454 2018-01-07 19:31:00 I had wack ass acne all over my freakin face, cleared up within a year bc of mask of magnanimity from lush and tea tree oil!!! I can’t stress the oil enough 

Sometimes my face is oily and sometimes ya dry, no matter what that oil has helped my fucking face so much

5459 2018-01-07 19:30:31 Dude Opening ANWR was brilliant and no body was able to do it despite the  obvious need to boost oil production to save the rusting pipeline. Lowering taxes was smart as hell. The wall? It will be a Godsend. Annihalating ISIS? Obamaboy didn't come
close.

5468 2018-01-07 19:29:15 I will be making hash browns for dinner, but it's a different brand so I don't know how much oil I'll need.
5469 2018-01-07 19:29:14 queenies who use bio oil I need help!
when you apply it.. is it supposed to be reddish?
5470 2018-01-07 19:29:05 Maybe not around you. I was surprised when moving my 94 yr old mother into assisted living to hear from my cousin that most of the folks there used cannabis oil edibles. Including my aunt, who has a lot of pain from osteoporosis. They're in Colorado. And not driving anywhere.

5473 2018-01-07 19:28:50 Sounds like you google technics are spot on...I don’t do a lot with oil but I hear that’s a popular problem it’ll take the guy 20 min watch...you’ll be bleeding from ass by time he leaves

5475 2018-01-07 19:28:43 I’m always curious if you guys actually believe in the snake oil you’re selling or if this just a 100% grift? How do you sleep at night?
5476 2018-01-07 19:28:40 Palmers cocoa butter lip balm the one in the big tube, Nivea moisture or just straight up coconut oil
5477 2018-01-07 19:28:35 heard the mouse in my room. didn’t see it leave. very nervous. i’ve been living here 4 months. i take every precaution and the one day i don’t put peppermint oil by my door it thinks it owns the place
5478 2018-01-07 19:28:34 I suppose your Energy project doesn't like all the new oil and coal usage very much.   Just say whats really on your mind rather then some line about nuke codes.
5479 2018-01-07 19:28:21 Like I said, some will support, some will revile. So here’s a golf clap for you. Jobs are up, no PST, infrastructure is booming, oil jobs are back in demand but you want to support this. Good for you, Cookie.
5480 2018-01-07 19:28:18 Its 3rd ingredient is palm oil! That's both interesting and deadly to my delicate valves. I'll definitely give it a try but I hope I don't like it!
5481 2018-01-07 19:28:12 You’ll lose.  But good luck.  Do you ride your bike to work?  Or just love subsidizing terrorists with foreign oil purchases?
5482 2018-01-07 19:27:52 …using the blood of our enemies in the light of our whale oil lamps.
5483 2018-01-07 19:27:49 It’s still made from oil and isn’t made to be put in the human body!
5484 2018-01-07 19:27:29 Yup. It was . Cut the sweet potato into quarter inch slices. Roast at 425 for about 20 minutes. Olive oil, salt and pepper.
5485 2018-01-07 19:27:27 I pretty much always use MCT because I don't like the taste of coconut oil.
5486 2018-01-07 19:27:26 He cooked every meal for months, made our bed every time me & bub got out of so it was nice to get back into, he sprinkled lavender oil onto sofa & throws everyday after he’d cleaned & tidied while we slept. Made me packed lunch when he was at work as I could never put her down.
5487 2018-01-07 19:27:13 Oil rich state, city Fbks u pay to see museum.
5488 2018-01-07 19:27:12 Coconut oil is my new fav thing.
5489 2018-01-07 19:27:11 If people pay good i will. Oil is not good for me. Skin gets red after any oil
5490 2018-01-07 19:27:03 Yes! Pork neck bones also to make authentic spaghetti gravy (not sauce!) and collard greens with olive oil and broken up long pasta!
5491 2018-01-07 19:26:57 I probably made some of the oil, that was refined into the plastics and polymers, that your electronics are made from.
If you would like a decent job, come on down to West Texas and get a job in the oil field. It’s very rewarding, and it pays well.  #MAGA, sad person. #GetWell
5492 2018-01-07 19:26:42 A memorable night that was. Was in The Eagle last night. Never realised the lantern above the entrance had The Lamp Oil on it
5493 2018-01-07 19:26:36 Ordered your MCT oil.

Question: generally speaking, when should I use this vs coconut oil?
5494 2018-01-07 19:26:35 ALL probs have CAUSES a
& EFFECTS. Nothing happens in vacuum 

ND militancy is by-product of  inequality & injustice associated with control, exploitation of ND Oil Resources & allocation of their revenues. Goes back to unitary struct & FG initial stealing of our economic rights
5495 2018-01-07 19:26:15 So Today was wash day for Kennedi.... I mixed some oils together and put em in her hair and put a shower cap on... I walked away for one second and she took the cap off and dumped 1/2 the bottle of Olive oil on her head.... 
5496 2018-01-07 19:26:12 Man the oil sector jagwal yayi yasa a wurin unless we start refining what we need for local consumption akwai trouble.
5497 2018-01-07 19:25:55 You are entitled to do what you like but I'm quite certain you don't completely get where I'm coming from. If you think a big part of the Oilers problem has been due to a lack of effort, you are intentionaly ignoring stuff for the sake of doing so. Cheers.
5498 2018-01-07 19:25:36 Oil of oregano!
5499 2018-01-07 19:25:33 I put my man onto face masks, exfoliating, putting baby oil in his lotion, and eating pupusas. I think I can say I’ve significantly made his life better.
5500 2018-01-07 19:25:33 So....is it an essential oil I can put in candles or is it toxic .. (so toxic that I was told not to use old railroad ties to border a vegetable garden)..because I luuuuv that smell..
5501 2018-01-07 19:25:20 What do you object to about Trump's behavior? The tax cuts? The diplomacy based on strength? The support for Israel? The promised wall? The slow down in illegal immigration? The facing down of North Korea? The opening of oil fields? Restoring opportunity? DACA down the drain? Wot
5502 2018-01-07 19:25:13 Creme rises to the top....oil just fucking murders everything
5503 2018-01-07 19:25:08 Really. Can you list those oil and gas spills for us please. I haven't heard of any for awhile.
5504 2018-01-07 19:24:48 Ok here goes. Obviously chicken breast!! Made a paste with olive oil lemon juice crushed garlic dill and parsley. Made slits in the breast and filled it with the paste. Then added sliced tomato red onion yellow red green peppers to the chicken. Sprinkled with cheese and baked
5505 2018-01-07 19:24:39 This coconut oil smells so good I want to eat it
5506 2018-01-07 19:24:35 We aren't more screwed.  You clearly don't work in the oil industry.
5507 2018-01-07 19:24:16 One of my go-to fast and easy dishes. Even with just garlic, shrimp and butter (or buttery olive oil) ... and the bread is definitely a must!

5509 2018-01-07 19:24:11 Actions say he has done a lot. Never a supporter and use to buy what CNN had to sell. But fact that most 350 mil of you think Eisenhower and Kennedy were sane and normal after each had speech warning on what trump is warning about is evidence you are being sold snake oil
5510 2018-01-07 19:23:54 Throw dried chamomile in a pot; bring to a boil then bring down to a simmer; throw a cloth over your head to catch the steam and inhale. Try to breathe through your nose, in or out- however you can! Or eucalyptus globuli extract in oil.
5511 2018-01-07 19:23:36 Remember the Santa Barbara oil spill! No drilling off our coast.

5513 2018-01-07 19:23:32 I think I got some tea tree oil in my eyes. It burns so much.
5514 2018-01-07 19:23:17 Got my oil diffuser going, black lagoon playing, and cuddling with my wittle baby. I love for lazy Sunday’s 
5515 2018-01-07 19:23:16 Got it running again. Jason had to stand outside and heat up the oil hose with a hairdryer. BRRRRR.
5516 2018-01-07 19:22:50 Remittances bring in more money than oil industry 

$28 billion per year. There’s a reason México does not want a wall and real enforcement of our laws.
5517 2018-01-07 19:22:49 Tea tree oil
5518 2018-01-07 19:22:46 This, from a former “teacher” who couldn’t see how we would fund an OIL FUND !!!!!
5519 2018-01-07 19:22:34 this is kinda interesting.  looks like prc doing its best to cut indian ocean out of the ME-to-China oil equation.
5520 2018-01-07 19:22:24 Yes! Sanchi is one of the very active vessels that has been exporting Iranian oil to India and China recently. It's a terrible what has happened!!
5521 2018-01-07 19:22:22 I find it extremely egotistical for “scientists” predict our impending doomed based on theory.  I also find it funny the left is extremely against oil and gas claiming ecological calamity but completely ignore the mines that produce   batteries.
5522 2018-01-07 19:22:17 When the flow of oil tankers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran suddenly thins and then stops... there fixed it...
5523 2018-01-07 19:22:10 When are we all going to wake up!?What kind of country will we become if we continue to allow our needs and rights put on a back burner for DACA and anyone else NOT a citizen? We have the power in our votes and in our voices to protest. Squeaky wheel gets the oil!
5524 2018-01-07 19:22:00 The Trump administration’s move to drastically expand offshore oil drilling puts our planet at risk. Instead, we should be investing heavily in renewable energy and sustainability to create millions of good-paying jobs and reduce our carbon footprint.

5527 2018-01-07 19:21:47 I miss having someone pump my gas, wash my windshield and even check my tires and oil.  But big oil makes more money if they get people to do the work and even charge for air and water.
5528 2018-01-07 19:21:36 plus alot of ppl talk abt how poor FSG is. Well, their red sox is worth 3-4 times more than LFC. Thus FSG pockets are deep. Their experience in sports management won't allow them to spend emotionally like Oil or Russian mafia $.

5534 2018-01-07 19:21:09 Because there are only 21 million btc coins available compared to billions of trx and xrp coins. 

Stop being an idiot it's simple supply and demand + scarcity that drive price. 

The same way oil has a limited circulating supply and the more limited makes it more valuable.

5541 2018-01-07 19:20:40 Oh you have oil...well there you have it, what are they whacking ya for oil per gallon these days? I’m sure service call going to be 150-225 plus oil ugh #theregoesthatinheritance
5542 2018-01-07 19:20:30 AKA Patchouli Oil!
5543 2018-01-07 19:20:30 US shale may not have been profitable sofar but for material volumes new oil, in the lower half of the cost curve, there are few alternatives for Brazil deepwater and Permian US shale. European majors have not been very succesfull in US shale though.
5544 2018-01-07 19:20:28 That’s going to do some damage. Killing thousands of sea life for oil/money. Killing the planet.
5545 2018-01-07 19:20:19 Open Cast coal and Exploitable coal. What we doing with that? with SNP and European green emissions. That’s great. The ban of Fracking has now stop us having decades of cheap gas. The oil is a globally priced commodity to solely rely on as showed in the last 2014 referendum.
5546 2018-01-07 19:20:10 The definition of irony: using electricity generated  from mined  coal  to mine a coin that is pegged to barrels of oil. #carboncycle #venezuela #petros

5549 2018-01-07 19:19:47 All made necessary by the fact that neither Slepyshev nor Caggiula are Top 9 NHL Players, & Strome is probably not a Top-6, either.
5550 2018-01-07 19:19:45 my mates went to Brazil for it btw & I know that given the choice of watching my team in the Maracana or a 3rd rnd in the wind & sleet I'd be reaching for my suntan oil without a 2nd thought.
5551 2018-01-07 19:19:38 Anyone that uses coconut oil on their hair STOP USING IT!
5552 2018-01-07 19:19:36 What a cursed generation we are. Others are mourning. You are busy talking about oil and vomiting insults
5553 2018-01-07 19:19:32 Today was my 1st Sunday morning home in awhile. I have cleaned up a thousand messes, oil paint off the toilet, pulled Claire off 5 counters, bathed 3 kids, wiped bums, brushed hair, changed diapers & hunted a lost gecko. How does my wife always get to church on time? #ilovemywife
5554 2018-01-07 19:19:32 Oh that's a good idea. I have dark brown hair so dying it very often requires bleach but I have always wanted to put some kind of crazy, wild color in my hair. One day if I save up enough, I may do the oil slick look but that's very expensive

5559 2018-01-07 19:18:40 Don't see the relevance of the Pacific angle, as the Cgy game is the only one that matters from a positioning standpoint. If they beat Arz & lose to Chi they are no further ahead. Oilers are at the stage where the opponent is almost irrelevant. They need wins and lots of them.

5574 2018-01-07 19:15:10 RT @LivingSafely: Eating mayonnaise this January? It's made by adding oil to egg yolks. Commercial mayo can be as much as 80% fat!
5575 2018-01-07 19:15:06 Coconut oil, chemically, is the same as butter. Both are saturated fats. Both are compounds that contain a carboxylic acid group with a long hydrocarbon chain consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Both are solid fats at room temp. Both are artery clogging and cause blockages.

5582 2018-01-07 19:13:52 And there it was! My favorite perfume oil and Zech grabbed it and bought it for me. Funny how something so small can make you so happy. Scent is the strongest sense tide to memory and this oil is a nostalgic reminder for sure!

5650 2018-01-07 19:05:10 none of them are important - the real business is natural gas replacing oil, disastrous power grid failures, and the new world order making islam the state religion to get bankers into the east's treasure trove of energy stores.
5651 2018-01-07 19:05:07 Oh please. We see this as the game it is. Jong Un is allied with Putin. Putin was sending him oil as he was "fighting" with Trump. Fake scenario. Stupid shit. Invisible.

5714 2018-01-07 18:58:40 The solution is revenue generation but Albertans have been brainwashed into thinking that their bragging rights are more important than fiscal competence. This is why AB swings from obnoxious gloating when oil prices are high and whining when they are low. Entitlement, eh?
5715 2018-01-07 18:58:37 The Paris accord was obsolete before it rolled off the lot. Even Teslas batteries are obsolete when you imagine 8 billion people relying on acid filled batteries. Beyond the edge is hydrogen fuel produced in the remnants of old pipe lines pumping water instead of oil.
5716 2018-01-07 18:58:26 Vast populations across the Middle East and Northern Africa quickly felt the consequences when Iraq's Saddam Hussein decided to sell oil in Euros. Then there was Libya's Muammar Gaddafi's pan-African gold dinar blueprint, which failed to create a splash in an oil barrel.

5725 2018-01-07 18:57:31 That payment was not strictly speaking a deal. It was money owed for oil shipments in 1979/80 that were never paid for. A similar situation exists with the UK and Israel. The UK is fast tracking term owed. And a Geneva court is deciding the Israeli outcome.

5728 2018-01-07 18:57:17 YEP I use coconut oil as moisturizer morning + night and rotate through Neutrogena acne & hydrating cleansers as my needs shift

Cory idk abt foundation bc I haven’t used it in years sorryyyyy, I would say a tinted bb cream, let it dry, then lightly powder over?
5729 2018-01-07 18:56:57 I don't know if it matters, but how I used it was I showered normally including shanpooing my hair. Then, when I finished my shower, I toweled off including removing excess moisture from my hair. Then I worked coconut oil into my hair with my hands and then combed it.

5732 2018-01-07 18:56:32 "Trump administration moved to enforce federal laws against legal pot smoking. On the same day, the federal government said it would expand offshore oil drilling, which California’s Senate leader called an assault on 'our pristine coastline'"
5733 2018-01-07 18:56:31 @CorinnaKopf use the Digestzen essential oil for dōTERRA I use it and I always feel better!
5734 2018-01-07 18:56:12 Omg I just typed "Salt pond Ghana Nigerian Crude oil" into Google & my head is about to explode.. how didn't I know about this?
5735 2018-01-07 18:56:10 Instead, opt for natural oils similar to the ones I just mentioned earlier like coconut oil and almond oil.
5736 2018-01-07 18:56:09 200-year-old farm house isn't exactly energy efficient. Burn a lot of oil, especially in these frigid temps. Called Petro on Friday night, asking for unscheduled delivery on Sunday. Just delivered. Happy -- and warm (relatively) -- customer!

5739 2018-01-07 18:55:59 Giving businesses a voice in the minimum wage increase is like letting oil companies decide what the environmental regulations should be on an oil wells. #ONpoli
5740 2018-01-07 18:55:52 @Colts offered Lucas Oil use in exchange for use of our fans at one home division game per season.
5741 2018-01-07 18:55:51 I am still shocked that the oil are 18-21-3, you log on to Twitter you would think they were 0-999
5742 2018-01-07 18:55:42 Goodness I’m less than three hours to home on my drive back from DCP and I had to pull over for some oil issue and it turns out it’s a leak so COOL
5743 2018-01-07 18:55:21 psa coconut oil > whitening strips !!!!! way more effective, quicker results n essentially better for your teeth
5744 2018-01-07 18:55:17 yeah I can't do that. If I'm being honest I probably use closer to 5 tbsp. Lol Also, let me know before you order MCT oil. I found a really good inexpensive one on Amazon. Keppi Keto MCT oil.
5745 2018-01-07 18:54:25 I either exfoliate with brown sugar, sweet almond oil, and raw honey. Or I use my konjac sponge with sweet almond oil. Also blackgirloveskbeauty is hell clutch with info and heyfranhey
5746 2018-01-07 18:54:20 Don’t let this happen. Leave some place wild and free. We have enough roads. We have enough oil.
5747 2018-01-07 18:54:19 my sister just called me and started blabbing about olive oil and then hung up im--
5748 2018-01-07 18:54:18 Also, the crypto bubble concerns mainly the ones who deliberately chose to be involved. Unlike banks and oil bubbles which affect everyone

5751 2018-01-07 18:53:50 I agree -- Bag Balm from Lee Valley Tools is best. Coconut oil will do. Slop on a big glob, pull a cotton sock over your hand & take a nap while it soaks in.
5752 2018-01-07 18:53:48 vitamin e doesnt need a carrier direct lagalo ya kisi lotion k sath mix ker k. lavender oil ka mun pe koi faida nahi hai but if you decide on using it then mix it (few drops) with a light oil for example coconut or olive oil
5753 2018-01-07 18:53:47 Oil  exploration is killing the most precious environmental resources we have left,but the influence of the energy cartel is great that it can practically buy entire nations,such as Ecuador,where foreign oil ventures are allowed to press ever further into the Amazon
5754 2018-01-07 18:53:44 Literally in the same situation. We noticed we were getting low.. and the company should have come out last week... cmailed they would be there on Friday...

Guess who didn't show up

We are now playing chicken with our oil.
5755 2018-01-07 18:53:32 Lavendar, Jasmine, Cinnamon, Clove, Eucalyptus, Peppermint, Ylang Ylang, Cedarwood, Sandalwood and Frankincense oil!

5757 2018-01-07 18:53:23 Don’t you just love it when you’re oil cleansing and oil gets inside your eyes
5758 2018-01-07 18:53:13 A president that opens waters to more oil drilling should open the first one outside his premier prop- maralago.
5759 2018-01-07 18:53:10 I can teach her the basic rudiments of house painting. It could be air brush, hair brush, roller brush to finish the job. Problema lang kung anong pintura ang gusto niya, oil based o water based. Wawateran ko ba o lalangisan muna for the fenishing, I mean finishing touches. lol
5760 2018-01-07 18:53:10 Pick up chilli oil to pass to friend at Chinese restaurant, child flicks something in your eye, rub eye.... run to loo to wash out eye for next 20 minutes...
5761 2018-01-07 18:53:07 Selling out to the oil industry! Disaster waiting to happen! How soon people forget the oil spills!
5762 2018-01-07 18:52:46 Beard oil is also known as 'Boil'. That's just what the cool young kids on the street tell me.
5763 2018-01-07 18:52:39 Yeah...that 1 has me pretty ticked. Just had 2 watch my son seize 7 times so far today. All I can do is watch & time it. Hopefully Duke will give him the THC oil soon. I need 2 cool down. Mama bear don't play & that's what I get 4 posting something personal.  Never done that b4

5765 2018-01-07 18:52:33 No, he didn’t. He is a zealot who steamrolled without coming up for air, while stock footage of Trump rolled in the background of Faux Fox entertainment. Jake looked like-and is- a snake oil salesman.
5766 2018-01-07 18:52:20 For anybody that still has doubts about climate change; I live in Mumbai, and today my coconut oil was solid at room temperature

5775 2018-01-07 18:50:51 She took my car with her to get a oil change and tire rotation..you know the usual.
5776 2018-01-07 18:50:42 I’ve been using Jamaican Black Castor Oil on my lashes every night for a week so far and I’m going to keep it up until my birthday in April and if I’m not satisfied with the way they’re growing by then, then I’ll get them done
5777 2018-01-07 18:50:32 Have resolved to  be as free of plastic as possible. Making my own toothpaste as toothpaste containers are not biodegradable. coconut oil, peppermint, tea tree and myrrhh all organic
5778 2018-01-07 18:50:24 Just watched BBC news where announcer stated two ships had collided near China with one being an oil tanker with million tons of oil on board. Surely there's no ship that big to carry that much? Check what you're going to say.
5779 2018-01-07 18:50:22 Funny how I no longer want an oil company job. But if I get one, I might change my mind. But till I get one, if I get one.
5780 2018-01-07 18:50:19 How to make tofu unhealthy: marinate in coffe bbq sauce and fry it in peanut oil.
5781 2018-01-07 18:50:16 Yea I’m not buying shampoo off the principle, I was told the balm more for moisture and making your shit look thicker. Coconut oil has broke me out twice but I’m not sure if it was the certain company I used
5782 2018-01-07 18:49:52 No. He was found guilty of contravening South African anti mercenary legislation. 
BTW EquitGuinea was/is not 3rd largest oil producer.

5784 2018-01-07 18:49:41 We have plenty of interests in the area because of oil and the consumer goodd commerce traffic lanes. Israel helps in securing the area as well. Pakistan conducted terrorism in Afghanistan long before Saudis exported Salafism.
5785 2018-01-07 18:49:30 Hashes are the easiest and best breakfasts. Making one with @Applegate bacon, sweet potatoes, pears, red onions and apples for next week as we speak. Just throw on a pan drizzle with avocado oil salt and pepper and bake.

5797 2018-01-07 18:48:18 Meanwhile oil rigs are operating at 1/2 strength.
5798 2018-01-07 18:48:05 Here’s an idea mr president, use the money that we make from oil and use it to pay off our debts!
5799 2018-01-07 18:47:49 I like most of their stuff... specifically the Argan oil and the AHA + BHA peel
5800 2018-01-07 18:47:49 Well I'm not sure if I can get you some oil to eat I'm afraid... /Thank you, you're too kind )

5802 2018-01-07 18:47:27 Yup. And that is (in a nutshell) why you where you at. Well, not you, but you know what I mean. #nowingers 
And this is no slight on Pulj... whatever... he’s good, no doubt. 
But what a drop off... and he’s rookie.
5803 2018-01-07 18:47:24 man this flower oil got me feelin all types of soft I love Haley for this 
5804 2018-01-07 18:47:15 Worst case scenario, you can get some diesel from the gas station to hold you over until you have oil delivered. OR just convert to natural gas (if available in your area) typically cheaper and more efficient than oil
5805 2018-01-07 18:47:10 Coconut oil is fake news please go get a haircut
5806 2018-01-07 18:47:08 Hello! Does the MCT oil pictured also mix well in to cold drinks?

5811 2018-01-07 18:46:16 Nothing brings out your inner hipster like the scent of an organic, vegan friendly beard oil.
5812 2018-01-07 18:46:15 I just ate some roasted asparagus with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder and it was absolutely delicious.

5815 2018-01-07 18:45:30 You're talking about what currently is fueling Space-X Rockets. Does that mean we'll be relying on oil forever? 

You are probably the type of person that accuses people who want green energy are hypocrites if they currently drive gas fueled cars. #cdnpoli #progress
5816 2018-01-07 18:45:27 I tried to bastardize a Keto Hot Chocolate recipe into an iced mocha recipe. Didn't turn out good. Still don't have MCT oil, just some early experimentation before I start the diet.
5817 2018-01-07 18:45:11 Trump, the Putin-powered con man, saves $ for his businesses as golfer in chief; he harms Americans by eliminating consumer protections in banking,mortgages,nursing-homes;  student loans;air- & water-quality; coast-line protection from big oil, & higher health costs for everyone.

5822 2018-01-07 18:44:40 Skipped my workout on Thursday, which means I missed out on 1 point for my challenge. So I tried yoga today! I’ve forgotten how much I enjoyed it! Had the olive oil sweats though.....#yoga #CrossFitChallenge
5823 2018-01-07 18:44:37 Oil doubles in price I have to spend 25% extra on oil based products   I have 25% less to spend on sausages ,eggs and bacon
5824 2018-01-07 18:44:28 I’m using this honey and almond oil mix. That shit a go.
5825 2018-01-07 18:44:28 Honestly might not even watch the oil game today. Just depressing.
5826 2018-01-07 18:44:17 Presidential Combine, hold it at Lucas Oil Stadium.
5827 2018-01-07 18:44:09 I started flaking like crazy last weekend and used some of that drunk elephant marula oil that I got a sample of and it worked like a charm. I was worried because I have oily skin but it turned it really nice.
5828 2018-01-07 18:43:59 so my oil light came on but the oil is full,  what is the first things I check? I looked it up but everything is confusing

5833 2018-01-07 18:43:26 I hate smoking anything, so its my preferred transport mechanism. But I put the oil into pills for more precise dosing (and so it survives stomach acid)

5835 2018-01-07 18:43:23 Early RHI installs often replaced gas, but ASHP now predominantly replaces oil or electric. Solar thermal still displaces (not replaces) gas.
5836 2018-01-07 18:43:14 The only reason Trump gives the oil companies ok to explore near coast waters is to finance stupid mexico wall break.

5839 2018-01-07 18:43:10 They go through the motions of a dictatorship taking over a country. While they cause chaos, tweets, etc. they've taken away park land, opened up oil drilling on all coasts (not done since 1966) and turned over desegregation for housing. That's just this week.
5840 2018-01-07 18:42:42 Anybody know a good spot that rotate tires and change my oil for my car for a good price

5844 2018-01-07 18:42:18 Blah, sitting here waiting for an oil change
5845 2018-01-07 18:42:14 thanks for the clue for heating the oil...., next time i hear someone wrapping mashed olives, i'll remind to heat them up a little bit...
5846 2018-01-07 18:42:13 I am looking for data that shows the causal relationship between global crude oil prices and Nigeria's petrol prices. Any direction you can give? Thanks a bunch dr

5849 2018-01-07 18:42:04 Not to mention... Who is he selling our oil rights to, exactly?
5850 2018-01-07 18:42:03 Americans have more to fear from incompetent legislators like yourself than from so called "Big Oil".

5856 2018-01-07 18:41:14 Yeah that can make you look a bit off lol. I’ve stuck to regular falsies for that matter. You should also try to use Vaseline or castor oil on your lashes to help them grow back stronger. Hope my tips help :)
5857 2018-01-07 18:41:09 If your skin can handle it, try straight-up tea tree oil. You can get it on amazon. It’ll clear you up, but use it very sparingly so it doesn’t dry out your skin too much. I used it every day at my worst but now only use it every now and then.
5858 2018-01-07 18:41:09 Ooooooo... "Big Oil".
What exactly is "big oil" & how do you distinguish it from "little oil"; & how is its wanting more area to drill different from farmers wanting more area to plant or the military wanting more area for bomb testing?

5860 2018-01-07 18:40:56 Thanks to the emergency vet services @BarnLodgeVets Ormskirk. Saved my dog's life today after she ate washed up #palmoil on #Formby beach. Dog walkers beware of palm oil. To dogs, it's both tasty & toxic.
5861 2018-01-07 18:40:41 wipe kitty down with a warm, damp facecloth a couple of times a day, this will take the dander oil off the fur.  it's the dander that gives you the allergic reaction.  i have 3 cats i'm allergic to and this works really well for me.
5862 2018-01-07 18:40:40 The true finals match is gonna happen when @lfKaLaS and @PBMsmite oil up and meet center stage in a WWE match.  Idc who you are that shit needs to happen.
5863 2018-01-07 18:40:38 Speaking of products....  Where can I order some more oil and balm? I'm almost out of the stuff you guys gave me over Thanksgiving.
5864 2018-01-07 18:40:28 Checked out the art museum it was pretty dope! Just picked up some infused olive oil, grabbed some food & now heading to the air & space museum  #SundayFunday #DCadventures

5868 2018-01-07 18:40:04 We can never move past Race. Greed requires justification or we’d turn on its perpetrators. Instead, we buy into their dogma and classify—EVERYTHING and EVERYONE. The hierarchy allows the system to oil itself Into perpetuity...
5869 2018-01-07 18:39:56 We should be making a drive to bank as much oil as we can now during the transition period. We're still going to need those reserves to power the equipment needed to make the switch to renewable energy.
5870 2018-01-07 18:39:55 In 1983 I was at a Gulf Oil employees meeting in Houston & several "20 years with the company" awards were announced & recipients were asked to come up & get their awards.  When some didn't show, there was lots of crowd murmuring because they had been laid off earlier that year.
5871 2018-01-07 18:39:36 Putin running out of cash.  Needs the price of oil to go up.  BIGLY.  And Russian oligarchs cannot be happy with intelligence operations around the globe exposing the Russian mob transactions.
5872 2018-01-07 18:39:30 Which global economy is this handler wishing to hide behind?
Are you a learner?
Global economy that countries GDP rose 2017. Even #UK with its Brexit challenges still grew. You are here coughing about global economic challenges.
After crude oil fall, what else?
5873 2018-01-07 18:39:20 Nice enjoyable run rattled off, very cold night but in and got a mug of bovril between my mits. Bath with olbas oil in as well 
5874 2018-01-07 18:39:19 All I want is to be on a beach with tanning oil all over me, sunbathing till I turn Golden/brown  
5875 2018-01-07 18:39:13 You don't know jack SCD our great state of Florida has given them priority even over the people who live here already because we care not because of possible votes. Unlike PR's  democrat leadership.  Florida doesn't need your snake oil.

5877 2018-01-07 18:39:00 have you tried coconut oil as a leave-in conditioner?
5878 2018-01-07 18:39:00 Is fish oil really THAT good for you? 
5879 2018-01-07 18:38:57 Then you would like an oil. It melts, just like butter.
5880 2018-01-07 18:38:57 Cult Is right, they have been brainwashed, programmed, indoctrinated whatever you want to call it. But not the Congress, I think they have been bribed with Russian money! Exxon, sanctions, oil, billions of dollars
5881 2018-01-07 18:38:54 PUBLIX USES COTTON SEED OIL WHICH IS WORSE DO YOU THINK .
5882 2018-01-07 18:38:54 Now that we've added early bitcoin purchasers in with vegans and crossfitters... can we go ahead and add essential oil devotees to the mix?
5883 2018-01-07 18:38:53 See as the dick dey like roasted yam 
And the blood like palm oil 
5884 2018-01-07 18:38:43 Diamond, gold & crude oil mine) on earth.
5885 2018-01-07 18:38:41 Maybe he’ll come up with some “snake oil” next! 
5886 2018-01-07 18:38:38 o i thought u had both essential oils. if u just have the regular vitamin E oil then ya it can b used as a carrier
5887 2018-01-07 18:38:34 Then again, I've gotten old motor oil at Starbucks, and they don't use percolators, so...
5888 2018-01-07 18:38:21 I am not embarrassed. I am pissed & now mobilized.  Silver lining, w/ tax scam, I will have more money 2donate 2DEM candidates that will protect women's rights, right to choose, social justice, healthcare,VA healthcare, lgbtq protections,  & promotes renewables over oil &fracking
5889 2018-01-07 18:38:20 Those bumps are common on nose  piercings I had one myself when I first got mine it was so painful I almost took my nose piercing out but tea tree  oil saved it
5890 2018-01-07 18:38:20 There's no such thing as gas shortage man, its all set up by the government, everything's controlled by the oil companies like I heard about this guy who invented a car that runs on water, its fiber glass, air cooled and it runs on water!
5891 2018-01-07 18:38:14 From 'Patrick Kavanagh - A Biography' By Antoinette Quinn, 2001. I cover the potatoes with straw, loose out the mare, and in no time I am sitting in an oil-lamp-lit kitchen eating a feed of flour bread and tea and eggs with an appetite I wish I had these days. #PatrickKavanagh
5892 2018-01-07 18:38:07 @Sir_RidleyScott Nice Mosaddegh foreshadowing but #ChristopherPlummer-who def gets #Oscar bookends-deserved more nuanced role. Why no increasing outside Bowiesque splits-a-family-in-2 pressure? GeorgvT as torn lynchpin of oil crisis of '73 instead of flat/greedy CF Kane. #Rewrite
5893 2018-01-07 18:38:04 Need to try something to mitigate the oil money but it’s too ideological and ignores the pragmatism required to fine tune it

5895 2018-01-07 18:37:24 You should, you voted for the biggest snake oil salesman of all times - you've been played by a con man and aren't smart enough to realize even after a year of evidence - YOU ARE PATHETIC and dimwitted
5896 2018-01-07 18:37:20 Has Sen. McConnell or Sen. Paul weighed in on how more oil and cheaper natural gas is going to help the coal industry ?
5897 2018-01-07 18:37:14 Burning the midnight oil..hahaha
5898 2018-01-07 18:37:09 In fact the question isn’t where the CO2 is *coming from*; Rather we ask where it’s *going*. The rate of atmospheric increase is only ~ half the rate we’re burning coal, oil, & gas. Fossil fuels account for 200% of the CO2 increase!
5899 2018-01-07 18:36:54 Those bumps are common  on nose  piercings I had one myself when I first got mine it was so painful I almost took my nose piercing out but tea tree  oil saved it
5900 2018-01-07 18:36:51 Get the rowing boat out I could use free oil right now.
5901 2018-01-07 18:36:26 The secret to “commercial quality” Kraft Mac and Cheese is letting the butter melt into the milk before adding the cheese packet and tossing a splash of olive oil on the macaroni in the colander
5902 2018-01-07 18:36:10 I officially have so much hair that i have to 
1) put it in a bun to wash my face 
2) section it off in order to fully detangle and oil it
5903 2018-01-07 18:36:03 I must say CANNIBIS OIL helped me STOP RX OPIOIDS, now I need nothing & I'm an old Hippy, POT was never addicting, everything else was, including BOOZE ! Sessions is a MORON, the people have spoken NOW can we talk psychedelics ?
5904 2018-01-07 18:36:03 Oil was always a volatile thing. Despite that it has always been a hugely valuable asset to every country lucky enough to have it. The only real problem with Scotland's oil wealth is that is has been systematically mismanaged and exploited by successive Westminster governments.
5905 2018-01-07 18:36:02 Every nfl sideline is like a garage floor covered in baby oil
5906 2018-01-07 18:35:52 #gbp think we could be in for a very exciting week ahead. We could be talking about a world class multibillion oil prospect been owned by an aim tiddler valued at less than £5m with £5m plus cash in the bank! Many bags to come here imo if that is the case with the tiny free float
5907 2018-01-07 18:35:36 Why can't iPlayer compression handle images of water boiling/oil deep frying without going blocky as hell? Wouldn't look like that on Netflix/Amazon.
5908 2018-01-07 18:35:34 Maybe the girl that removed d boxer ate yam and oil before the blowjob
5909 2018-01-07 18:35:29 His ass should have been fried in hot oil!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5910 2018-01-07 18:35:19 Oil
5911 2018-01-07 18:35:18 Right?! It defies all logic. There’s not enough olive oil on them, and it’s got table salt on it, yet you’ll never not ask for more...
5912 2018-01-07 18:34:28 WOAH I used only a few drops of my goddess face oil which has almond, jojoba, and neroli oil in it, and my eczema patches have reduced significantly over night
5913 2018-01-07 18:34:21 World news not mentioning the 130,000 tonnes of oil on fire on the supertanker
5914 2018-01-07 18:34:03 
5915 2018-01-07 18:33:57 A great job, thanks for all the oil leaks.
5916 2018-01-07 18:33:51 castor oil really does help with hair growth
5917 2018-01-07 18:33:42 Mr president what are your plans for Turkana Oil, it's not among your big 4..
5918 2018-01-07 18:33:42 on each occasion the 45th president abolishes a crucial regulation, more than one earthling dreams about being a #Democrat
5919 2018-01-07 18:33:42 For soup, cook crushed ginger in oil, then simmer with chicken, cayenne, mushroom broth and zucchini. Top with parmesan.
5920 2018-01-07 18:33:42 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
5921 2018-01-07 18:33:42 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5922 2018-01-07 18:33:37 Look at those oil spots from that soup. Not as good as the restaurant, but damn tasty. Had it for breakfast on the way to Europe.
5923 2018-01-07 18:33:28 Coconut oil, hair grease I be slapping all that shit on there
5924 2018-01-07 18:33:23 Use olive oil as a deep conditioning hair treatment. Olive oil helps improve hair health by adding nutrients and healthy fats. #tip #hair
5925 2018-01-07 18:33:16 Thank you! I'm glad you like them! I have created 8 of them, but there will be more and I'm slowly posting them on social media ;) It's great that you'll be attending an oil painting repair course. Have fun in Beijing ;)
5926 2018-01-07 18:33:15 Right now a freighter carrying 136,000 tons of crude oil is burning after a collision off China's coast, the Keystone Pipeline just leaked 210,000 gallons of oil in South Dakota, and countries around the world are racing to phase out the sale of gas/diesel powered vehicles.
5927 2018-01-07 18:32:46 DISGUSTING, @realDonaldTrump fowling our air and water, risking our oceans in the name of favor with big oil industry, just like coal, where are the protections for Baron’s generations future, my son is 9 and needs assurance that he will have a future of clean water and air
5928 2018-01-07 18:32:45 Скажите этому ватному ублюдку, что в Англии все что не хватает на отопление пенсионеру компенсирует муниципалитет, к тому же из-за удешевления нефти отопительный керосин (OIL) коим топят большинство домохозяйств подешевел в два раза, а пенсии выросли.
5929 2018-01-07 18:32:42 coconut oil is the shit 
5930 2018-01-07 18:32:38 Just stop shipping them petroleum products: gas, oil, plastics, etc.
5931 2018-01-07 18:32:25 yeah; let’s hobble ourselves so that we have to buy our oil from countries like Iran Afghanistan Saudi Arabia the Moslems that love us! So the ships coming across can flounder and dump their oil all over the sea and so that our citizens don’t have jobs!
5932 2018-01-07 18:32:25 The crypto currency bubble is bad, yet only a tiny bleep compared to giant central banks bubble (caused by 10y of quantitative easing) - and even that is just a bleep compared to the massive bubble in the energy (oil) markets. It's all intimately connected.
5933 2018-01-07 18:32:23 Has to be the best 3rd FA Cup weekend for years #MagicOfCup #FACup
5934 2018-01-07 18:32:18 Also Team T: as far as chapped lips go, I got A LOT of the following same answers: Blistex, Carmex, Aquaphor, Neosporin, Coconut oil, that Mooiki (sp?) oil, all of which I’ve tried & none of them have worked for me. There are def a few I haven’t and will report back. Thank you!
5935 2018-01-07 18:32:06 Yes they are having trouble selling tickets to games this year. Last year I had no problem selling my upper level tickets for $250/each! This year I can’t even sell my row 9 tickets for $80/each.......there is no longer the demand for tickets in Oil country with this team now
5936 2018-01-07 18:32:05 Canada Gay friendly Oilsands at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that throw our  off Buildings. Build Kinder Morgan for the good of  and the world’s  community.

5938 2018-01-07 18:31:35 By dangerous do you mean poorly designed or there’s something on the road surface that’s dangerous like oil etc.
5939 2018-01-07 18:31:30 Look into Argan Oil or Coconut Oil. It’s supposed to help follicles, but I’m not sure.
5940 2018-01-07 18:31:28 Why is there always that one auntie at church that rubs fish oil under her wig 
5941 2018-01-07 18:31:27 burn the midnight oil
5942 2018-01-07 18:31:25 Should @POTUS aim for Autarky?  This would entail grater exploration for O&G to meet US energy needs and also stopping all shipments of oil and gas abroad like Freeport LNG shipments to Asia.  I would also entail stopping shipment of agri. products to Asia.
5943 2018-01-07 18:31:14 mankind have many energy resources either can be renewal or natural sources. but for real they kill each other over oil
5944 2018-01-07 18:31:09 It is funny that you listen to Gov Brown of .ca. He is distorting our delta. He used tax payers money to search for oil on his property. He is a scam. Ruining Ca.
5945 2018-01-07 18:30:59 It's safe to say the way arsenal is going down we'll soon discover oil, gold, fossils, calcite, biotite, quartz, gypsum and hell
5946 2018-01-07 18:30:50 My aunt smuggled in homemade olive oil and give me some. I'm crying that is the best gift ever. I just don't know how she gets past customs at the airport. lmao
5947 2018-01-07 18:30:49 My back hurts like Hell, but I gotta go change the oil in the ole Civic today.
5948 2018-01-07 18:30:44 Total SA sold AB assets due to uncertain NDP political climate. Total SA immediately, June 2017 invested $4.3B into more politically certain IRAN. Please don’t let Socialist apologists tell you Notley is a victim of low oil prices.  IRAN has no rights for .
5949 2018-01-07 18:30:38 Ah ok! Maybe try and don’t tell him  they don’t taste like beans at all, I roasted mine in olive oil, chilli, cumin and turmeric. Or you could do a little chicken fillet for him in the pan at the same time 
5950 2018-01-07 18:30:23 Hadn’t fleeced enough tax breaks and sweetheart deals for his oil company buddies?...
5951 2018-01-07 18:30:22 the key to life is coconut oil and water
5952 2018-01-07 18:30:02 Terrible service from Ultramar, called them for at least 5 days, they say they will deliver oil but they don't. How can they treat their customers like that?
5953 2018-01-07 18:29:51 Ok, former jersey girl here chiming in....it’s a beautiful thing. Plus, I can pump gas and my first boyfriend showed me how to check the oil. But, in rain, snow, or freezing rain, you’re dry and comfy in your car and listening to Bruce. #whatexit
5954 2018-01-07 18:29:43  pork oil
5955 2018-01-07 18:29:42 Yes, I remember the Arab oil embargo, in 1973.
5956 2018-01-07 18:29:39 I scrambled my egg in truffle oil OMG 
5957 2018-01-07 18:29:27 Nobody wants offshore oil drilling but nobody wants higher gas prices... Can’t have it both ways.
5958 2018-01-07 18:29:25 No. The MSM are reporting facts.  He is on his way, if not totally destroyed 1) the state dept.2)the EPA 3) given away parts on National parks to oil & gas.4)destroyed our credibility with ALL our allies & made us the laughingstock of the world.5)cheated with Russia’s help 2 win.
5959 2018-01-07 18:29:17 I NEVER used sauce from a jar until Rao's marinera: Italian tomatoes, olive oil, onions, salt, fresh garlic, fresh basil, dried oregano-no sugar, no bad stuff, always good. When I feel like it, I add stuff: garlic, wine, meat, sausages, red pepper. Secret is the Italian tomatoes.
5960 2018-01-07 18:29:14 Castor oil with a difference 
5961 2018-01-07 18:29:01 It wouldn't surprise me if All of the agencies are pitching in to black ops that make the rich even richer when acquire their land, gold, oil, poppy fields, diamonds of Africa, profits from sex traffic and even organ trafficking.  Who Profits?
5962 2018-01-07 18:28:55 I pull a Minecraft and punch the damn thing. XD

But seriously, I could try alternatives than just wood. I could try burning the resin by cutting a small hole in the tree. Make an oil like substance.
5963 2018-01-07 18:28:54 My sister got accepted to LSU.. she said “Move down here and we can live together while I go to college! You can work on the oil rigs!” 

BITCH 
5964 2018-01-07 18:28:53 You voted for the #TaxScamBill which included opening ANWR to oil drilling. Now you object when it’s off your shore? Nice NIMBY there, Senator.
5965 2018-01-07 18:28:25 yeah, though the smashburger we eat at is light with the oil (which I like)
5966 2018-01-07 18:28:21 France wants the oil in Southern Cameroons,  so her vassal state of La Republique du Cameroun and its puppet, @PR_Paul_Biya have licence to massacre Anglophones. Shame @EmmanuelMacron @UN @antonioguterres @Tobias_Ellwood @PScotlandCSG @realDonaldTrump
5967 2018-01-07 18:28:12 Where does the oil come from?  Do you think it'd would create jobs? Why don't you make your state a state park? But then, what would you do with the people?
5968 2018-01-07 18:28:06 HEA: Oil truck came! Rejoicing here on the planet Pluto aka Boston 'burbs! (Although email says 233.6 gallons were delivered, so that's like... 1.4 million dollars...?) (In Nov. they delivered 78 gallons...)

5971 2018-01-07 18:27:45 So disappointed in @KalTire Kamloops.  My dad got his winters on there in Oct to beat the rush.  Snow comes, he slides, checks tires & they weren't changed over. He only got 2 of his winters back (2 he doesn't recognize) and they offer $10 coupon/oil change :/

5982 2018-01-07 18:25:53 I just watched him smoke a bong with veggie oil and dish soap as the bong water, took a fat ass hit...and he drank it. All of it.
5983 2018-01-07 18:25:24 Hmm. I'll have to look into that - it's not how biometric systems work. There are some systems that claim to generate PUF mechanisms from a bio, but they're rare and often snake oil. Certainly just a hash will not do it.
5984 2018-01-07 18:25:20 Im glad people are retweeting my tweet on oil drilling
5985 2018-01-07 18:25:19 I'm watching xfiles, and that's definitely the black oil virus.   
... definitely
5986 2018-01-07 18:25:17 Are the #UCP plotting new taxes on electric and hybrid vehicles to support good jobs in a vibrant oil sector? Asking for a lobbyist friend. @UCPCaucus

5989 2018-01-07 18:24:39 So you are saying you want the oceans to have oil rigs everywhere risking potential oil spills. 

Did you know before the tax cut bill Oil companies paid 9 cents per barrel for oil clean up.  After they pay 0 now.

5991 2018-01-07 18:24:02 BBC1 News just reported that the oil tanker involved in a collision in the East China Sea was carrying 1 million tonnes of Crude oil. Really? Try checking facts 1st....it is 1 million barrels, only 136,000 tonnes. Slight difference. Sloppy.
5992 2018-01-07 18:23:58 I hope it's not an all-or-nothing argument.  Maybe you can use the trading leverage to ensure that they use all the safeguards that Deepwater Horizon omitted,  This argument shouldn't always be against American companies.  What are Catholic & Muslim oil countries doing? Nothing?
5993 2018-01-07 18:23:35 Tried to leave at 11:30 and my car was too low on oil to start and then my dog escaped is this hell
5994 2018-01-07 18:23:33 Pazardan Coconut oil aldım her yerime sıvadım çok geç tanıştığımı fark ettim çok beğendim. Kendimi yürüyen coconut gibi hissediyorum buram buram coconut kokuyorum şu an.

5996 2018-01-07 18:23:24 Looks like you are right. For a channel like TimesNow a oil Rig and a oil tanker there is no difference, their views are  one sided and thinks they are always right!
5997 2018-01-07 18:23:20 I ain’t put no makeup on for church this morning and opted for coconut oil instead.. I’m out here looking like a grease monkey. 
5998 2018-01-07 18:23:19 I have to be in school ng 7 am... which means I have to wake up at 4:30 am and leave at 5 am HAHAHA let’s try to sleep goodnight, Kirst inaantok ako sa essential oil niyo 
5999 2018-01-07 18:23:10 If you want I could come over and rub some oil on your chest
Should help
6000 2018-01-07 18:22:59 Es muy posible que lo pierda el grado de inversión, en línea con lo que pasará con el país. Sin embargo,  mirando hacia adelante el recorte de gastos y rally del oil la beneficia. Reservas de petróleo aumentarán contablemente y volverá a repartir decidiendo este año
6001 2018-01-07 18:22:57 No one deserves hate
6002 2018-01-07 18:22:55 But when oil and gas companies start drilling and there's another spill (remember 1969) it's not going to be so fucking pristine, is it?
6003 2018-01-07 18:22:54 I use the coconut oil at night when I sleep 
6004 2018-01-07 18:22:46 Big Pharma and Governments don't want you to know this, but the THC in Marijuana Oil kills Cancer cells.
6005 2018-01-07 18:22:28 I asked my mom to make healthy food. Instead of oil, she used ghee because apparently it's healthy. #IndianMom

6007 2018-01-07 18:22:23 & Trump is as far away from Reagan as oil of Olay is from preparation H 
6008 2018-01-07 18:22:17 Use that, caster oil & coconut oil. Shampoo/conditioner too to wash
6009 2018-01-07 18:22:10 Anyone else suspicious that the oil tanker bound to S.Korea from Iran which 'collided' with a Chinese cargo ship is not an accident? 
Given S.Korea stopped 2 oil tankers getting into N.Korea in as many weeks, are we seeing a war starting over imported supplies?

Watch this space.
6010 2018-01-07 18:22:07 Michigan so cold, I'm trying to cook and the olive oil that was on the counter next to a window has solidified.

6015 2018-01-07 18:21:42 Total SA sold AB assets due to uncertain NDP political climate. Total SA immediately, June 2017 invested $4.3B into more politically certain IRAN. Please don’t let Socialist apologists tell you Notley is a victim of low oil prices.

6020 2018-01-07 18:20:26 I'm watching bowling and realized that seeing the oil color on the lane and all the ads flashing around is really depressing. I miss Saturday LIVE bowling on ABC.
6021 2018-01-07 18:20:23 Take a breath, Sen Murray. Nothing has changed yet. There's a 60 day window for public comment & cases to be made why drilling in an area, even if it has the Earth's largest oil reserve, is a bad idea. Make the case where it counts. Id est, not Twitter.
6022 2018-01-07 18:20:17 Oil sucks
6023 2018-01-07 18:20:07 Went to get an oil change one time and while the employee was handing back my keys started asking gross questions like “how much sex I have” & what my bra size was. I try not to go anywhere alone anymore cause it’s almost every time that someone comes up to me.

6028 2018-01-07 18:19:29 lavender oil shouldn't be used on the face directly. it doesn't suit everybody. Use rosehip oil. It's legit the best facial oil ever!!!!

6037 2018-01-07 18:18:38 Another “celebrity” tweeting about being against oil while tweeting from her Petroleum made iPhone, driving in her Petroleum filed and made vehicle and heating her house with natural gas. Put your money where your mouth is and get build a log house and get rid of anything oil
6038 2018-01-07 18:18:22 This is nice but Norway is overall a climate 'villain' because of continued oil extraction
6039 2018-01-07 18:18:20 Gotta admit I'm a little puzzled by this Eat it, Wear it, Swear by it tag on my jar of coconut oil.
6040 2018-01-07 18:18:12 No. Just str8 up fist in was, no lube, but maybe oil.

Perfect remedy to stop hair fall 
6042 2018-01-07 18:18:07 PMS $400/tonne. Bring your receptacle alongside the tanker, receive, confirm quantity, hand cash over,  and sail.

Marine oil and gas is a totally different ball game.
6043 2018-01-07 18:18:06 i had a dream i was a cool star wars character with a jetpack shooting rly wild looking stormtroopers on an oil rig. i got caught but exposed that the stormtrooper's commander was trying to bribe me into joining them so i got released?
6044 2018-01-07 18:18:05 and some coconut oil apparently it helps to grow hair
6045 2018-01-07 18:18:01 Why would that bother trump? He already green-lit drilling for oil off the coast of Florida already.
6046 2018-01-07 18:17:52 @BBCNews  The tanker involved in a collision off Eastern China is carrying a million barrels of crude oil, not tonnes!

6050 2018-01-07 18:17:25 Crossing my fingers that we don't run out of oil -_-
6051 2018-01-07 18:17:19 When did they start to use palm oil?!

6053 2018-01-07 18:17:14 More over, there is no wealth in the mountains, at some point Taliban will have to find some kind of income, the organization has lost almost all its oil fields.
6054 2018-01-07 18:17:10 That's their job. Folks on oil platforms put their lives on the line so we can live comfortably but we don't romanticize it.
6055 2018-01-07 18:16:50 Being able to hunt hibernating animals, drilling for oil in pristine environments, increasing income disparity, disparaging and demoralizing intelligence agencies.  Yeah it's all MAGA!! Lol you all would give up your freedom of speech to support this guy and drive liberals nuts!
6056 2018-01-07 18:16:49 Oil and gas assignment already. Lord I should have just done Islamic law when I had the chance
6057 2018-01-07 18:16:33 if people were making a concerted effort to legalize prescription cannabis oil that'd be one thing, but i've had to deal with too many potheads to think that it's "safe"
6058 2018-01-07 18:16:25 Did they create the oil pattern off of that dress 
6059 2018-01-07 18:16:23 Total SA sold AB assents due to political uncertainty.  Immediately, June 2017 invested $4.3B in more politically stable and certain IRAN. Pls stop the lie that Notley is a victim of oil prices.

6065 2018-01-07 18:15:35 He is right. You have to mix it with something and then apply. Essential Oil is fine but VitE directly will ruin your life.
6066 2018-01-07 18:15:30 Are you taking comments from the public or just from oil companies?
6067 2018-01-07 18:15:14 In 1915, Venustiano Carranza decrees suspension of operations of the oil companies until legislation is in place to regulate them.
6068 2018-01-07 18:14:36 Coconut oil - pure fat, no water in it like in lotions.

6086 2018-01-07 18:11:54 Now try it with the oil light
6087 2018-01-07 18:11:49 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to tolerate the conditions of these fields.
6088 2018-01-07 18:11:45 They aren't. Hemp is only good at making sheets and plastics out of so we don't all burn alive. Anything that says "hemp" will not do "marijuana things". They'd use such oil on horse saddles and the likes.
6089 2018-01-07 18:11:38 Justin Trudeau has already stated his long term Ideals are to shut down the Oil Sands and his hero’s are all Dictator’s    And he wants increase trade with China. He thinks more about human rights of foreigners the of Canadians
6090 2018-01-07 18:11:37 SHUKAR! You are suppose to mix it with some normal oil, i think coconut. direct would ruin your skin
6091 2018-01-07 18:10:43 This model is skewed and basically shite.
It counts Oil & Gas and Whisky as a London asset.
6092 2018-01-07 18:10:40 One of my most favs in the essential oil world. Great to use during readings.
6093 2018-01-07 18:10:38 Massage peppermint oil on your temples, neck and back of your scalp. It may not make it go away completely but it always helps A LOT for me
6094 2018-01-07 18:10:35 It’s essential oil for my footspa, I swear! 
6095 2018-01-07 18:10:34 A bus full of Hawaiian Tropic models pulls up to you and your best dude while hiking down the highway and ask if you want to get paid to oil them up for money, do you get on?

Except for Scotland of course. Where it's a massive burden that we should really thank the UK gov for taking off our hands. Aye?

6110 2018-01-07 18:08:47 Perhaps not having Miller on at all would’ve been a better choice. All the Sunday shows are covering palace intrigue. Meanwhile we have Pakistan funding, pot policy, Committees to investigate former political opponents, oil drilling, stacking NY Federal prosecutors...
6111 2018-01-07 18:08:47 What did Motor Oil pussy do now?
6112 2018-01-07 18:08:43 One trade doesn't matter. Even two. I hate posting trades unless unusual. Truth is I have index shorts not working but oil/gas that is. Wrong-sided BA, DB but was solidly long $SQ, $IP, $UAL, $GE, $GM ... 
Trading Is Not A Game Of Perfect!
6113 2018-01-07 18:08:41 coconut oil is pretty good if you've got some.
6114 2018-01-07 18:08:40 dunno, perhaps you could peruse Blue state economies: plentiful jobs, tech growth, high real estate values vs the red state failures. I suppose blue states could promote obsolete coal mining and oil driling instead of going w/green tech like China, EU.

6121 2018-01-07 18:08:03 I just discovered that canned beans are nice drained and served with salt, parsley and oil. This is inconvenient, but why not.

6126 2018-01-07 18:07:30 every time I diffuse thieves oil I feel like it’s cleansing every fucking thing away why don’t I use it more often
6127 2018-01-07 18:07:28 It’s hard to compete with a club owned by an oil rich country, city get injuries they just spend £50+ million to replace them, same with Barca and Madrid that are government owned and PSG oil again, you will do well to keep Kane mate, money has ruined football

6135 2018-01-07 18:06:40 I have a whole bunch of oil warmers and burners.
6136 2018-01-07 18:06:39 I remember the good old days when we would try to deplete the rest of the world's oil resources before our own.
6137 2018-01-07 18:06:39 mix it with some carrier oil olive,coconut,almond jo chaho like 10drops of carrier oil and 2drops of essential oil. Soch raha hun beauty blogger bann he jaun

6141 2018-01-07 18:06:00 When I got a haircut this week the stylist told me olive oil is better than coconut oil for hair. Thoughts?

6143 2018-01-07 18:05:48 bad credit? coconut oil.

6146 2018-01-07 18:05:24 I’m wearing red lipgloss and Mkhulu just asked me what oil I rubbed in my lips because “it looks strange”
6147 2018-01-07 18:05:17 Any oil can be an essential oil if you develop an addiction to it.
6148 2018-01-07 18:05:15 Why can't my oil heating break down in the middle of summer?!?! It never, fucking, ends.
6149 2018-01-07 18:05:13 Oil of oregano does wonders! Good luck tonight!
6150 2018-01-07 18:05:07 Mangosteen. I never heard of it. Ima see if my job sells it. And I heard black seed oil works wonders!!! I really wanna get some.

6156 2018-01-07 18:04:27 @realDonaldTrump 97 of every 100 scienetist say #climatechange is man made, but toddler Trump is going for new search fields to find Oil. Interesting to see u choose thoose odds in, lets say, a question regarding your fastfood health 
6157 2018-01-07 18:04:06 mix them with aloe vera as a carrier or a gentler oil like sweet almond oil and then put them on your face - not directly
6158 2018-01-07 18:04:01 Happy I started using witch hazel and tea tree oil. By the end of February my skin is going to look right 
6159 2018-01-07 18:03:24 Well done!  Drill and drill BIGLY right in front of that m’fers property. First time I ever hoped for an oil spill.
6160 2018-01-07 18:03:19 No worries, as the Fed and our government says that inflation is not even 2%.  Heating oil price increases don't count - you will overcome the price increase by putting on a heavy sweater.
6161 2018-01-07 18:03:11 I remember Obama sending money from the shovel ready jobs for Americans to:
3 Billion to Brazil Oil an oil company owned by Brazil and then cut our drilling in the same Gulf.
2 billion to Kenya, what is our connection with Kenya...other than communist like Obama.
6 bil missing
6162 2018-01-07 18:03:05 I was so excited to fry festival today. Y’all. Guess who’s out of oil 
6163 2018-01-07 18:02:58 An olive has to go through three stages, for its oil to run:
It has to go through the shaking, the beating, and the pressing
And just like the olive, some of you may have felt like you go through the shaking, the beating and the pressing & now your greater is coming 
6164 2018-01-07 18:02:39 Coconut oil solves all of my problems
6165 2018-01-07 18:02:25 I don’t have any oil to be ‘freed’, I’m sure it’ll be fine
6166 2018-01-07 18:02:09 Motor oil, tires, filters, suspension systems are all things I love to nerd out about.

6171 2018-01-07 18:01:53 idk like u always oil the pan jae what the fuck thats just how it is theres not enough oil in the meat also what the fuck is a nonstick pa
6172 2018-01-07 18:01:41 also peppermint essential oils on your forehead/temples helps cure headaches (and hangovers) but if you get headaches w your anxiety peppermint oil is the way to go
6173 2018-01-07 18:01:31 Fried in olive oil , just can't help myself 
6174 2018-01-07 18:01:25 I need some holy oil to throw on you
6175 2018-01-07 18:01:16 What Ben means by open is that a couple of people with oil and mineral rights get to extract resources and sell it to us while we pay taxes to maintain the public land closure from us. Thanks Ben.
6176 2018-01-07 18:00:56 Very disappointed in Petro Oil.  We are an automated delivery and service customer -  furnace is giving us cold air.  Not sure if it's a service issue or oil delivery issue.  On hold for more than an hour and maybe service at 7-10 tonite @PetroHome
6177 2018-01-07 18:00:51 "alberta is oil and cows and nothing else" went from being a shitty torontonian stereotype to mainstream conservative thought pretty quick, eh?

6179 2018-01-07 18:00:50 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
6180 2018-01-07 18:00:49 The fiber.  I do capsules for the oil
6181 2018-01-07 18:00:44 So what if we've got oil the price is the same regardless where its extracted, is Scottish oil better than that of Russia, UAE, Kuwait, Canada, the US, have you learned nothing from the oil crash?
6182 2018-01-07 18:00:44 Jojoba oil @ night gets my skin right together.
6183 2018-01-07 18:00:41 He smell like a 30 minute oil change
6184 2018-01-07 18:00:38 Kinda. I was meeting her halfway with the kids today. She came for a wellness check, but needed an oil change and had the stuff. 
6185 2018-01-07 18:00:37 I hope you’re right. I’m also not too worried about their future. Tampa is a good example of that. Went to the finals than conf. Finals than missed the playoffs and this yr they are dominating. The Oil will get better. Just not this yr.
6186 2018-01-07 18:00:31 Mine was like that not too long ago. I used coconut oil and diprobase. Not together but before bed coconut oil and before I went to work diprobase and I kept topping up after lunch time
6187 2018-01-07 18:00:28 Scotland 'Should Abandon Oil' 25 years on from Braer Spill
6188 2018-01-07 18:00:27 Cbd oil.
6189 2018-01-07 18:00:14 No. It is not. Please tax avocado toast, beard oil and any kind of coffee that is more complicated than an Americano.
6190 2018-01-07 17:59:45 Okay so ladies I’ve lavender essential oil and vitamin E. Should I mix them both and it put on my face or is that a recipe for disaster. How else can I use them.
6191 2018-01-07 17:59:43 Oil excelled in second half last year, and they still could. But not if PC stands pat or does lateral moves. He needs to win a trade. He needs a @Lowetide 3for 1. Al Montoya for a fourth???  Does anyone think AM ahead of LB will be the deciding factor of the postseason?
6192 2018-01-07 17:59:38 @CleanAirMoms @AGBecerra @Head EPA is a previous Atty from Oklahoma not a scientist as  our PR invests in oil drilling
6193 2018-01-07 17:59:37 Does oil pulling REALLY WORK?
6194 2018-01-07 17:59:29 2.) Sleep on a cotton pillowcase. I know everyone loves their satin pillowcases, buuuuttttt those hold oil & that transfers onto your face at night. Use a silk scarf and/or a bonnet to protect your hair.

6197 2018-01-07 17:59:07 We do know you've done more than "sympathizing" with them, certain among your ranks also took bribes from them, facilitating their access to the region and making oil trafficking via Kirkuk..
6198 2018-01-07 17:59:04 I think the coverup was admirable, but probably would've been best to cut their losses on the shoot and VO the oil exposition, was eery to watch

6201 2018-01-07 17:58:45 Oil is like real saucy juice.
6202 2018-01-07 17:58:29 this oil in my hair really be disrespecting my pillow cases
6203 2018-01-07 17:57:54 Yay! I'm having a sneaky bath with my amazing relaxing oil!!
6204 2018-01-07 17:57:53 So this evening I’ve used the full of grace naked facial oil by @LushLtd for the first time under my cup of coffee face mask.. new favourite product alert!  Left my skin feeling super soft and one happy customer 
6205 2018-01-07 17:57:49 "Blavatnik attended a fund-raiser for President Obama...and, according to the Times, offered Obama advice on how to double U.S. oil production. (He was one of the wealthiest donors to the Obama campaign, and also contributed to Mitt Romney’s.)"
6206 2018-01-07 17:57:32 I’ve called multiple times since Friday with no return call.  I’ve been a customer for 50 years but I guess that doesn’t matter when we need you most.  What do I do with my 91 year old father when he runs out of oil tonight in 5 degree weather. Is auto delivery is for warm sunny
6207 2018-01-07 17:57:30 You couldn't pay me to eat seafood w/all the #radiation, pollution and oil sludge in the ocean. #amjoy #CleanEnergy
6208 2018-01-07 17:57:27 @foundmyfitness I was curious if you have looked into C60 olive oil supplement and what you think of it. Thanks
6209 2018-01-07 17:57:20 I'm one of two oil when I drink
1. I get faded and turn up
2. I get faded and go to sleep no matter where I'm at
6210 2018-01-07 17:57:07 Tea tree oil is my new miracle wonder. Just put overnight oil on my face and my spots has started to clear.    #beauty #cosmetics
6211 2018-01-07 17:57:04 I par boiled chipped potatoes then roasted the chips in hot oil before transferring them to a tray to fully crisp up. Wallop.
6212 2018-01-07 17:57:00 I dont know what your headaches stems from but I get migraines from stress because that's all I do and I recently started using an oil diffuser with lavender or eucalyptus and it helps me sooo much
6213 2018-01-07 17:56:41 Former CIA Director James Woolsey is on board of advisors of the Washington Institute of Near East Policy as well as on the one for Genie Energy, which is trying to drill for oil in the disputed Golan Heights border with Syria
6214 2018-01-07 17:56:27 @realDonaldTrump Your PIPELINE EO resulted in an estimated 200k gallon spill of the dirtiest crude oil on earth. Don't you owe an explanation to "we the people" of the clean up of that crud and if it affected ANY AQUIFER?
6215 2018-01-07 17:56:17 TCP or clove oil may help as well
6216 2018-01-07 17:56:15 I’ve been waiting two hours to get my oil changed. I had an appointment, and they haven’t even started my services. “30 minutes with appointment” @pepboysauto ??
6217 2018-01-07 17:56:12 My dad has started vaping and he’s been putting beard oil in it by mistake  and he wondered why he felt funny
6218 2018-01-07 17:56:10 Last time I checked I wasn’t allergic to anything. Right now I’m using biore products with the spinning brush and palmers cocoa butter and oil. Witch hazel seems to dry my skin out but I still use it occasionally
6219 2018-01-07 17:56:09 And - for the umpteenth time, Scotland doesn’t depend on oil revenues any more.  We gave countless other strings to outrage economic bow.
The “oil price crash” lie is used in the same way as the “hate the English” lie: to detract from the very real support for Indy.
6220 2018-01-07 17:55:59 Dude I was the same way I used to hate not washing my hair everyday cause my hair would get oily but then I discovered the Moroccan oil dry shampoo and now I hate washing my hair lmfaoo

6222 2018-01-07 17:55:21 did you all hear about the US coastal waters being opened up by Trump for oil drilling?
6223 2018-01-07 17:55:13 Yass my baby needed that oil change bad
6224 2018-01-07 17:54:59 Mr. Tapper, you more than held your own against a blizzard of lies and evasions from this Trump stooge. Thank you for cutting off his bizarre filibuster. He was not going to answer your questions. He just wants a soapbox from which to sell Trump’s snake oil.
6225 2018-01-07 17:54:44 There is an oil refinery near mathura, 
Is this makes Tajmahal to go darker,will any one close that refinery.
Illa oru general knowledge-kaga kekkuren.
6226 2018-01-07 17:54:43 Do states have a right to ban gay marriage? Ban abortion? Set policies to make sure undocumented people are NOT voting? Drill for oil? Deny climate change? Make sure people use a bathroom that matches their genitalia? Hmmmm?
6227 2018-01-07 17:54:39 @jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump marijuana is a safer than opioids y'all should make it legal &get the tax revenue. p.s. I know good ppl who use it rather than pharmaceuticals. I personally use hemp oil 4my chronic neck pain thnks 2 mosh pits &slam dancing n my former life
6228 2018-01-07 17:54:24 “Y’all only like dark skin women when they are covered in oil” women find ways to be oppressed so bad lol
6229 2018-01-07 17:54:18 Dinosaurs are oil...no wonder it is the blood of Satan!
6230 2018-01-07 17:53:53 And also oil prices are recovering which Unionist parties and media are strangely quiet about.
6231 2018-01-07 17:53:42 Love it when my 18mo pours olive oil on the carpet ;) #patience #itonlytakesasecond
6232 2018-01-07 17:53:38 Is there a seasoned oil that chefs use or just regular seasoning in the oil?
6233 2018-01-07 17:53:38 When the world economy is growing, India’s economy is on a downward trend & that too with low oil prices. Reason is simple, Crybaby has diverted the discussion to cows & Akbar. Even the opposition is not questioning Petrol loot.
6234 2018-01-07 17:53:34 Iranian oil tanker burns, 32 missing after collision off China's coast BEIJING (Reuters) - A tanker carrying Iranian oil and run by the country's top oil shipping firm was ablaze and spewing cargo into the East China Sea on Sunday after colliding with a Chinese freight ship,…
6235 2018-01-07 17:53:32 You should shoot for the Oil ... lol
6236 2018-01-07 17:53:28 Meaning that crude storage will do depending on what oil prices will do.
6237 2018-01-07 17:53:26 Would like to buy coconut oil for this girl.. 
Who sells?
6238 2018-01-07 17:53:24 No-one's justifying rape so read b4 ranting. The point made is tht marginalizd groups ie kids in/out of care home are de facto among most vulnerable in society bcos they're alone (I was one of them). Authorities know this so why does it still happen? PS You're no oil painting...
6239 2018-01-07 17:53:21 Wait, do you mean the Nat’l Endowment for the Arts?  Different animal. And again, that money helps educate the population. So why should it lose funding?  There are other programs that could be done away with (like oil subsidies) that would make more sense.
6240 2018-01-07 17:53:16 And the difference between WM and the govt in power is precisely Zeroz both @UKLabour  & @Conservatives have been disastrous with their economics.
FYI: oil price collapse affected the entire world - strangely UK & Scotland are more screwed. Why? because UK govt in WM are useless.
6241 2018-01-07 17:53:12 True, the money the World Cup would bring in actually has not much size compared to the money their oil brings in annually 
6242 2018-01-07 17:53:02 Question is if crude storage isnt just a function of the oil price and has no predictive power.
6243 2018-01-07 17:52:47 (Brings oil)
6244 2018-01-07 17:52:42 FG should be careful with oil marketers.d oil marketers are looking for ways to increase d price of fuel despite d fact they have no reason
6245 2018-01-07 17:52:36 God bless you, Michael Moore!  Scott Pruitt ruined Oklahoma but left us with plenty of earthquakes with all his kickbacks from Big Oil fracking.
6246 2018-01-07 17:52:07 If it's enough coconut oil to drown me, it could possibly solve mine.

6249 2018-01-07 17:51:16 if I drink the essential oil will it give me the same effect
6250 2018-01-07 17:51:08 Correct, does it include the debt price that previous Govt.s has taken,
Also policy about dropping of price of oil will have to include the drop of price of transportation resulting to drop of price of goods, i can assure you, that will not translate into that.
6251 2018-01-07 17:51:00 Some guy just put a thing of oil on the counter and told me what kind of car he had then when I asked what he was looking for he was like, "Well this comes with an oil filter don't it?"
6252 2018-01-07 17:50:53 CNBC and Y Fin have different symbols for Currencies , OIL, and ETFs

It is hard to get data if you do not get the exact symbol, their searches suck too, indexes use a dot in front or ^^ at start, difficult if there isn't a common standard.

Yea I know, YOU EXPECTED QUALITY?
6253 2018-01-07 17:50:41 We don't "produce" crude oil. 
We extract it, depleting whatever resources of oil exist. It's very useful, but don't pretend its some grand answer to all our problems.

6261 2018-01-07 17:49:57 Trudeau insured that Ontario will be foreign oil dependent for decades by killing the Energy East pipeline. It was announced as a Trans Canada decision, but it was Trudeau's new regs that killed it.
6262 2018-01-07 17:49:46 They done rubbed some atonement oil on me forehead 
6263 2018-01-07 17:49:41 Back when the Niger Delta Avengers were issuing statements, this govt  hinted at taking indiscriminate action to deal with them. Same for IPOB: boots on ground immediately. 

See, protecting oil and preventing 'treason' matter more to Abuja than securing the lives of Nigerians.
6264 2018-01-07 17:49:25 Mango will oil you up and keep you warm ;)
6265 2018-01-07 17:49:20 My eyelids are pure oil and super sensitive. I use Milani eyeshadow primer ($7 at Walmart) and it has worked way better than UD for me
6266 2018-01-07 17:49:10 Russia doesn't have the resources. Oil price is too low to meet even domestic commitments. If they look outward, they will primarily seek influence in the former Soviet sphere.

6274 2018-01-07 17:47:28 To be honest they are forward thinking out of necessity. If Canada didn’t have access to oil and gas and large rivers we would be too. But they are showing us what is possible

6319 2018-01-07 17:40:52 True. But it’s the middle-of-the-road voter who needs to keep seeing this. The ones who bought this snake oil.
6320 2018-01-07 17:40:47 It is fraud to say no global warming oil and gas know there is they want money more and its not a joke all humans will die.

6324 2018-01-07 17:40:39 Yeah~ Definitely odd to say but with all things in perspective, we have much, much larger problems in front of us. 

The Admin quietly relaxed Safety/ PSM regs in the fall for Oil& Has and now opened Drilling. Hoping the states are ready to battle & enforce their own regs.

6327 2018-01-07 17:40:29 I also think far-right voter suppression is the big story.  The Founding Fathers never asked for oil portrait ID.  Some groups go to great lengths to make it difficult for others to vote.  Don't you think.

6329 2018-01-07 17:40:20 In the real world,  Energy Stocks are set to soar this season.  We still need the "evil oil" for a while and with global uncertainty and new trade agreements, Canada's set for a spike! What's your Money on?
6330 2018-01-07 17:40:16 As much as I want oil and gas production to drop, and exports to decline via gov't policy, nothing will change until demand (and prices) permanently drop.

Luckily, the alt energy and EV trends (busses, transport & cars) is unstoppable. In less than 10 years #bigoil will be dead.
6331 2018-01-07 17:40:14 How many millions of cars are taken off the road in Europe because of their rail system that is light years ahead on NA? How many billions of barrels of oil left in the ground? Yeah it won’t get built.

6342 2018-01-07 17:38:17 Thanks! Mines Roman, but maintenance would be the same right? It came with a small amount of oil but that’s run out now. You keep yours in a scabbard?
6343 2018-01-07 17:38:04 Refried beans are so easy to make. Grab your cooked pinto beans, a little olive oil, garlic, onion, cayenne if you like it, mash with a potato masher, recook and voilà! Refried beans
6344 2018-01-07 17:38:03 When I was a kid I imagined illegal aliens as living in homeless camps using oil drums for fireplaces and hiding when the immigration trucks came around to round them up and drop them at the border.  They can actually apply for assistance w/o being arrested?

Add 1 cup red wine, bring to simmer & reduce to 1/4. Add tinned tomatoes, stock cube & simmer/reduce. Finally add Ocado frozen chargrilled vegetables
6347 2018-01-07 17:37:41 Is Asaluyeh a gas reservoir or oil reservoir?

In case of a gas reservoir, the associated gas volume will be huge compared to the amount of condensate. The GOR will be extremely high (i.e. >10^5 I believe).

Yup - API sounds about right. Libya has many condensate reservoirs.

6353 2018-01-07 17:36:18 Yes it’s the same as petrol and diesel - you’re reliant on a hugely expensive, inefficient and vulnerable infrastructure to get fuel to the car, and you’re at the mercy of the oil companies and NG producing empires. EVs undercut all that so you can see why there’s protest!
6354 2018-01-07 17:35:56 Oil?

6364 2018-01-07 17:34:16 In no way possible can you compare the environmental impact oil has compared to the EV industry. I don’t buy luxury vehicles but owning a Tesla Model 3 will allow me to have a 7yr cost use equal to a Camry. I’m counting the days to my last trip for gas
6365 2018-01-07 17:34:02 Question, what happens when I add organic coconut  oil to a sunflower C60? Does anyone  know? Thanks in advance.

6367 2018-01-07 17:33:40 But the point is that we were told x amount of glacier ice would cause y water level rise and "the science is settled". It seems neither statement is true.  Particularly adding this to the myriad other misdiagnoses the climate change snake oil salesmen have handed out.

6421 2018-01-07 17:27:13 @griffithenergy Guess who lost a customer...   Ordered oil, paid, week+ and no delivery, empty tank and ignored calls.   Lesson learned.
6422 2018-01-07 17:27:12 Just read blog 1 and 2 and immediately went to get my lavender oil. This Australian flu feels better already because I’m relaxed! Thank you!

6442 2018-01-07 17:25:31 Rosehip oil (from Rosa rugose)  is cold pressed oil and Rose oil generally referred to as Rose essential oil is obtained from Bulgarian Rosa damascene by hydro distillation.
6443 2018-01-07 17:25:28 >  Our economy isn't inherently bad, and certainly hasn't been for all of 300 years.  The current issues for Scotland are due to the oil price collapse, in the main.

6448 2018-01-07 17:24:35 Seriously been helping me. My skin is so dry this season and I just discovered coconut oil.
6449 2018-01-07 17:24:23 It's never too late.  Don't forget to oil up.
6450 2018-01-07 17:24:20 There have been concerns over rising crude oil prices putting pressure on the Budget, but more worrying could be an impact on industry, especially aviation, since its cost of operations is steadily going up.
6451 2018-01-07 17:24:16 There seems to be strong doubt as to wbere the oil tanker was heading. Shall we speculate and say... North Korea?
6452 2018-01-07 17:24:15 How you grow ya eyelashes?? People tell me they’re a good length but first of all, that’s false. Bouda start putting castor oil on em 
6453 2018-01-07 17:24:07 Heat your pan on medium-high. Once it’s hot, spray a bit of oil in it or whatever you use, crack your eggs in it (they’ll make that sizzling sound), add approx 2 tbsp of water, and cover them. The water essentially poaches them and the steam cooks the yellow without burning. 
6454 2018-01-07 17:24:01 Venezuela would be a better argument if we weren’t controlling with whom they can trade their oil for other goods.
6455 2018-01-07 17:23:58 @realDonaldTrump President Trump, please stay out of native American tribal lands. Leave Bears Ears alone! If you develop over native ceremonial grounds, you're desecrating a church! How would you feel if the property of the white house is developed over for oil?

6459 2018-01-07 17:23:22 "Revenge is best served with palm oil" I agree!
6460 2018-01-07 17:23:21 No, there is a giant 275 gallon metal tank for holding flammable oil in our basement.  A truck comes by and fills it up with expensive ass oil through a hole in the side of your house.
6461 2018-01-07 17:23:14 It’s not my head they are begging to oil
6462 2018-01-07 17:22:45 Ohhh i do love grapeseed oil!
6463 2018-01-07 17:22:35 No, not Egg-Free, but they are Dairy-Free.
I made these this morning:
Eggs, coconut milk, almond flour, coconut flour, coconut oil, bit of sea salt, bit of baking soda.

I don’t really follow specific recipes I just kind of add ingredients together the way I feel like doing. 
6464 2018-01-07 17:22:22 A Ca. GOP state sen. found $1B that cld be cut from the budget (a sop to oil industry they weren't even asking for anymore), took it to Gov. Brown, who loved it. State GOP shot it down: "We can't give Brown the win." It's all a game to them.

P.S. The guy quit the GOP in disgust.

6469 2018-01-07 17:21:56 Discouraging consumption of sugary drinks is a societal benefit. The sugar industry is historically as evil as diamonds or oil and the ill effects on our health is a scourge that needs removed.
6470 2018-01-07 17:21:54 Wait so you buy a container of oil and that's it until the next delivery?

6480 2018-01-07 17:20:45 Thirty two Iranians went missing today Sunday after an oil tanker collided with a cargo ship off the coast of east China....Just how?
6481 2018-01-07 17:20:36 Like oil/corporate subsidies and the bloated military budget - which is mainly used for buying bombs and planes from defense contractors (rather than raises for troops and the VA - which I would wholeheartedly support) who donate to Congress and @POTUS campaigns.

6490 2018-01-07 17:19:22 Thanks! Yeah, this one really took me by surprise. I opened the capsules and mixed the powder with an oil I normally tolerate well, so I don't see what else it could have been.

Unless I was coincidentally reacting to something in the air. Twice.

6519 2018-01-07 17:15:14 It's all about the Oil. We are distracted to only look at his property empire. Not his dealings with Stephen Schrwazman and Blackstone. Who are part of of a Rosneft with Glencoe Qatar. The big ginger has a 7.5% stake.
6520 2018-01-07 17:15:11 i put my fucking eucalyptus oil down not in my locker cus i didn’t want it to spill by accident & i guarantee someone threw it out... to say i’m pissed is a goddamned understatement
6521 2018-01-07 17:14:48 Oil coming back kind of helps.
6522 2018-01-07 17:14:39 When you guys finish using the oil do y’all save it, pour it down the drain or flush it down the toilet ?
6523 2018-01-07 17:14:37 fish oil is good for you!
6524 2018-01-07 17:14:35 Yikes. Get some vitamin c, electrolytes,  antioxidants and down some fish oil next time 
6525 2018-01-07 17:14:24 I needs to get some more coconut oil
6526 2018-01-07 17:14:14 I was thinking the palm oil syndicate.
6527 2018-01-07 17:14:11 My ass spilled coconut oil all over my damn bathroom this morning. 
6528 2018-01-07 17:14:06 What is the difference between an A.I. that has the goal of maximizing profits at all costs versus an oil company or any "…insert Fortune 500 corporation logo here?" — Could it be regulations?
6529 2018-01-07 17:13:54 That is fine, how many businesses move out of Cali and into Texas?  They would suffer long before we would and considering Red states have the most oil.
6530 2018-01-07 17:13:43 Oil heating sucks. Apparently burned $200 of oil in a month, wasn’t expecting it to be empty so soon, now very cold.
6531 2018-01-07 17:13:29 When I mentioned snake oil salesmen on a forum someone asked me where they could buy snake oil!
6532 2018-01-07 17:13:16 They don't get it. Sugar is poison. There should be a charge to poison us. Individually owned vehicles have made us slaves to oil and is bad for our health and environment, and yet they demand this shit be cheap.
6533 2018-01-07 17:13:14 “Hopefully one day, you'll be able to move out of that hellhole oil refinery depressant of a city” well look at me now (:

6537 2018-01-07 17:12:45 However, there is one country in the world run by wildly ideological enviro-twits that thinks the demise of the oil industry will somehow result in solar powered airliners and save the world.

6538 2018-01-07 17:12:38 I am the greatest president, a very stable genius.
I fire guys like Bannon, Spicer, Scaramooch and Priebius.
My White House reeks of cooking oil, I'm full of self delusion.
Believe me with this Russia thing, there has been no collusion.
6539 2018-01-07 17:12:32 Well why stop there? Why not pave the whole state so it’s easier to drill for oil?
6540 2018-01-07 17:12:24 I stopped using moisturiser creams and started using oils instead (sweet almond oil and rosehip oil). It's done wonders for my skin and I now wear a lot less foundation.

6549 2018-01-07 17:11:22 It’s good for freeing up stiff derailleurs & cleaning away old oil from chains & jockey wheels. It’s not a great lubricant in itself though.

6561 2018-01-07 17:09:56 Are they going to be linked to some of this Russian stuff? Is that the reason they are trying to stop it. After all they are bought by the Koch brothers who have known links to Russian oil refineries.  Mmm makes you wonder.

6563 2018-01-07 17:09:32 @realDonaldTrump. Enough is enough !! no more deaths in venezuela, by starving or needs of medicines.  No more bawdry with the assassin of Maduro, and his rowdies, gansters, bullies and corrupts. Its necessary a action of boycott of oil, or a military intervention. NO MORE TIME.
6564 2018-01-07 17:09:23 He's worth what 110BIL?!  THE white house is full of the second most wealthy men who control oil, gas, mining everything down to the toilet paper & export/import.  Amazon just raked in at the 110b mark too.JESUS SAYS YOU CANT LOVE HIM AND MONEY YOU DELIGHT IN EVIL! U MAKE ME SICK
6565 2018-01-07 17:09:10 It sounds like the valves on your radiators need to be replaced - we went through a similar thing last year. Call your oil company.
6566 2018-01-07 17:09:05 This is an extremely complex issue, affecting Miners in Australia, OIL exports by $BHP< largest exporter in world, the Australian Dollar, the yuan (spelled always with lower case y), unemployment & inflation in mainland China.

6567 2018-01-07 17:09:03 Hey @TacoBell, serious question for all my vegan friends....
What kind of oil do you use to fry the potatoes in?
Thanks!
6568 2018-01-07 17:08:59 And we also have oil from south America,  Russia,  Asia and all the oceans.  Why not use their oil and save ours for last?
6569 2018-01-07 17:08:56 #FakePresident is still on a crusade to punish States that were won by #HillaryClinton. Fake President Trump wants to drill the #NewJersey Shore for oil. Trump wants to destroy New Jersey’s beautiful beaches
6570 2018-01-07 17:08:28 International fuel prices have a spiral effect on any country’s economy. Global crude oil price crashed from $100 a barrel in January 2014 to half by November 2014.
6571 2018-01-07 17:08:26 Lmaoo
6572 2018-01-07 17:08:25 But Trump either doesn't actually have principles - or he doesn't have the power to stick with his policy against the interests of the deep state, the military-industrial-complex, the Israel-lobby, the oil industry, ... you name it.
6573 2018-01-07 17:08:10 We can tell the main ingredients  in your  tea and cookies .BHO gets award for being best snake oil salesman ever
6574 2018-01-07 17:08:00 I suspect if the vote was now (and there hadn't been one in 2014) then the entire campaign would be different and so would a lot of the arguments being made (Yes wouldn't talk about oil and No wouldn't talk a about the EU - if anything those'd be reversed!)

6579 2018-01-07 17:07:21 EU Ambassador Jana Hybaskova. 
"European Parliament must stop EU nations, buying ISIS Oil" 

I'm unable to find it on YouTube but you're journalists. Her statement should be on record.
6580 2018-01-07 17:07:19 "We'll walk away from debt!" "It's Oor Pound!" "It's Scotland's Oil!" You're stuck in 2014 aren't you?
6581 2018-01-07 17:07:19 Trump is right for once.
There is no collusion.
If your employed by Putin and he asks you to do something, you do it 
It's called conspiracy in America. 
This is no longer America, it's Trumpistan
Trump is being paid by Putin w 19.5% ownership of Rosneft.
He will become oil baron
6582 2018-01-07 17:07:09 Fundamentally the economy is driven by oil, the gov is not going to put a damper on that major source of funding for itself and "friends". If they really cared about the environment we would see zero duties on EV's and chargers all over. All we have is strategies and studies.
6583 2018-01-07 17:06:52 Miller got owned and treated like the snake oil salesman he is.  America is waking up to the continual sales pitches by this administration and it cant come soon enough.  The Trump administration is a #NationalEmbarrassment

6586 2018-01-07 17:06:24 My car IS solar powered, thank you very much.

It runs on gas which is refined from oil which is made of compressed biomass which consists of plants or things that ate plants which used sun energy to create life

6590 2018-01-07 17:05:55 The common man in India is paying for the series of economic blunders the Modi government instigated. 2017 observed a fall in international crude oil prices.

6592 2018-01-07 17:05:35 My mom just texted me and my sister saying one of us has to go to the store to get lemon oil before 2 and my sister said noses but I am perfectly content with pretending to be asleep till then
6593 2018-01-07 17:05:09 A lot of them are underwhelming esp the hyped ones but have you tried the Azealic Acid? It does a good job of evening my skin. Otherwise I like the squalane oil & the red colored AHA + BHA peeling solution is a godsend
6594 2018-01-07 17:05:08 Way to go Jake!  Miller was wasting everyone's time.  Miller is a snake oil salesman that got butt-hurt because he wasn't allowed to make his sales pitch.  I feel like America is starting to wake up.
6595 2018-01-07 17:04:55 All Bannon, all Trump insanity, all the time. Meantime, ICE deporting noble sole caregiver for 6 year old paraplegic, more offshore drilling, protection against offshore drilling disaster stripped, along w responsibility of oil cos to pay for it. Cabke, please, a little balance!
6596 2018-01-07 17:04:43 Why not send a bill to every single oil company that ever worked in that area. Why not add a tax to every single fracking & refining Co. operating in TX & make it illegal to pass cost onto consumers? Why not end ALL tax breaks & TX gov’t subsidies to all fossil fuel industries?
6597 2018-01-07 17:04:41 3min on med-hi, flip, add peeled olive oil coated garlic cloves to pan, 3 more min, then add rosemary springs on top, put in 400° oven ~12 more min

Thank you

6599 2018-01-07 17:04:17 So, if i understand you correctly, you believe it's high oil prices that have caused NG prices to lower?  OK, going with that theory, the 'sentiment' is that higher oil price = more drilling which = more 'associated gas (NG)'......
6600 2018-01-07 17:04:08 This guys is smoking a cigarette while he's changing my oil
6601 2018-01-07 17:03:59 So EVERYone is using WAY more oil than usual & blowing up oil co's estimate of when they'll need refill. We've great insulation: dropped 2 degrees/hr upstairs, 1/hr down. But we cranked heat during storm because I fear dying in the icy void of outer space.
6602 2018-01-07 17:03:56 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
6603 2018-01-07 17:03:43 But it's resolved . I'd be more upset at the loss of all the national parks,healthcare,services and all the oil wells popping up everywhere... but that's just me...
6604 2018-01-07 17:03:36 Go put some oil on them legs, the Mean Doctor, was right you're penis crippled...
6605 2018-01-07 17:03:15 Conservative environmentalists are already cheering that 135,000 tons of oil have been dumped in the water. Weeeee!!!!
6606 2018-01-07 17:03:06 Whoa Jake! That was lit! Great job - You effectively got Miller to prove what a snake oil salesman he is. Just like his audience of one 
6607 2018-01-07 17:02:58 When a recipe specifies 3 tablespoons of "good" olive oil, I tend to mutter a few choice epithets. Get over yourself, recipe.

6609 2018-01-07 17:02:42 My question was to Jim orginally as my Father, who is a fan, talked about his coverage on the subject

Your thoughts on why these commodities have divereged recently. Higher #Oil and/or #Gas previously didnt cause #NatGas to lower.
6610 2018-01-07 17:02:37 Putting my shield of oil and moisturizer on before I got out on this cold.
6611 2018-01-07 17:02:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
6612 2018-01-07 17:02:25 And I said - look at the fundamental picture, what has changed in the last 2 years? 1.  We can now export crude oil. 2.  Reversal of NG pipelines to flow more gas TO henry hub. 3.  We only have "X" amount of LNG export capacity and it's an expensive process...

6617 2018-01-07 17:01:52 Very frustrated by coverage of this Iranian oil tanker collision off China. It's been 10-11 hours, & still haven't found single article yet addressing PLANS OR EFFORTS TO PUT OUT THE FIRE. I mean, are they going to burn a million barrels of oil just burn?
6618 2018-01-07 17:01:52 1. Korupsi diapain aja argumennya ga baik; 2. 90% dari total $205.3 Milyar Export Saudi berasal dari Oil and Gas (2016); 3. 42.9% GDP (indikator kekayaan) Arab Saudi berasal dari sektor Industri Migas (2016). Can't wait for the world to change from oil and gas to solar panel.

6624 2018-01-07 17:01:28 Not surprising they’d place their need for oil over a free Iran-pretty typical of any EU nation. Sad.
6625 2018-01-07 17:01:19 You can't value them on an individual basis because, as you pointed out, it's the entire spine of Leicester's team, they'd essentially have to rebuild the structure of the team, which will be like turning an oil tanker around (hence not worth that money).

6629 2018-01-07 17:01:10 Story on out-of-oil thing: EVERYone is running out of oil, so delivery co is scrambling. Storm = crank heat in case power goes, you'll have extra hours before pipes freeze/death/financial death. Storm also = crank heat in houses w bad insulation bcuz 74 feels like 68.

6632 2018-01-07 17:00:23 I put bio oil on my face and one time I lit the lighter to close to my face and I thought I was about to catch on fire. I smelled burning something for 2.5 seconds

6635 2018-01-07 17:00:16 Fair point: There is no collusion, which is illegal, if you are actually employed by the Russians. Then you are just doing your employers bidding. Trump was paid with the promised 19.5% of Russian Oil Rosneft last December 6, 2017. Follow the money & quid Pro quo.
6636 2018-01-07 17:00:02 We don't need a pipeline.  It doesn't fit with our climate issues to increase oil production #cdnpoli #climatechange #pipeline #pnpcbc
6637 2018-01-07 17:00:02 AH.... think you got that backwards.    Kind of like bringing back OIL and not promoting CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY.
6638 2018-01-07 16:59:51 @chucktodd @MeetThePress you idiots have certainly taken the bait!  How about oil drilling?
6639 2018-01-07 16:59:49 Added some stress free aromatherapy oil to my diffuser and then rubbed some onto my body for good measure before crawling under my anxiety blanket. Mastering this whole adulting thing.
6640 2018-01-07 16:59:41 Let burn the midnight oil
6641 2018-01-07 16:59:40 But Kent we both know that is driven by technology and oil prices. 

And while your staff may say that $30B number is big - it’s a fraction of past annual capex....

And our activity is certainly not because of pipeline access eh?

That said - let’s keep pulling on the AB rope!
6642 2018-01-07 16:59:28 If we had additional pipeline capacity,we would have cleaner air and lower rates in Rhode Island if we were not burning oil and not using renewables. (renewables include garbage burners and wood burners)
6643 2018-01-07 16:59:12 Booo the beat the Oil!
6644 2018-01-07 16:59:09 If there is a phaseout of nuclear and coal and increasing use of electric vehicles depress oil prices--oil, which produces 25% less CO2 than coal and is often found in the ground with natural gas, could increasingly be used to generate electricity.
6645 2018-01-07 16:58:42 She’s a snake oil salesman.
6646 2018-01-07 16:58:27 Just a spoon holder for the spoon I'm using to measure out the oil
6647 2018-01-07 16:58:27 Ive got to say the oil of olay hasn't worked.
6648 2018-01-07 16:58:21 Hard to do.  They need to suspend all oil exploration, above and below. Sun and wind would work for me.

6666 2018-01-07 16:55:55 Club still needs to be run and wages paid. It's not oil money we have .
6667 2018-01-07 16:55:52 7/ If you want to do this very efficiently focus on a niche. Avoid cars and cell phones.  Do Oil and Gas, Motorsports, High temp cells, etc.  Do something no one else does or knows how to do and sell out to a niche player like ITGR ($1.4B cap) or SAFT (owned by Total)
6668 2018-01-07 16:55:50 It’s a good thing this can’t happen in BC! When all those oil tankers take oil through Vancouver they’re protected by tug boats. No sailors will go missing because they could swim too shore.
6669 2018-01-07 16:55:39 Do you ever put on coconut oil and feel like a new person??
6670 2018-01-07 16:55:23 Oil > liquor.
6671 2018-01-07 16:55:22 Well, @MMFlint will be drilling for oil right on tRUmp’s FL beaches in June. He’s already bought the rig.
6672 2018-01-07 16:55:08 Nobody with any sense thought the oil tanker that is the British economy would come to an instant halt. Yet we are all already significantly worse off, with food and other costs up, holidays way more expensive &c.

6683 2018-01-05 23:59:57 It is a great call. But what those Jovian clouds have made me realize is that even our best expressionist oil painters have nothing on the awesome beauty of the universe (yes I know Van Gogh wasn't exactly expressionist himself, but close enough).

6690 2018-01-05 23:58:52 It's really starting to upset me that nobody knows what colour I mean when I say oil spill
6691 2018-01-05 23:58:37 I believe Great Scot! he knows how bad the last oil spill was for biz in FL, he also knows none of the money goes to FL residents. Aside from that, I despise him.
6692 2018-01-05 23:58:36 Outstanding!
6693 2018-01-05 23:58:35 @carmenmarienel @F62Forbes I cannot even think of black coffee, taste like castor oil.
6694 2018-01-05 23:58:34 That’s why I had to stop using it! Grapeseed oil will change your life I’m telling you it’s so light and has my skin on point when I remember to use it.
6695 2018-01-05 23:58:31 I know you have a million responses but I used to have my foundation settle into my smile lines bad because my skin was so dry, I started using a good face oil which reduced my fine lines and now that doesn't happen to me anymore! So... Oil? Hehe

6700 2018-01-05 23:59:58 I'm also a teacher and this will begin the lifelong goal of the Republican party to undermine public education in favor of the private schools for rich folk. @lisamurkowski should be ashamed of this vote and of selling her soul to big oil.
6701 2018-01-05 23:59:57 It is a great call. But what those Jovian clouds have made me realize is that even our best expressionist oil painters have nothing on the awesome beauty of the universe (yes I know Van Gogh wasn't exactly expressionist himself, but close enough).

6721 2018-01-05 23:57:46 Whaaat??! The fuck. The social costs of oil are off the charts. To let them slide oily off of paying for their spills is #unconscionable. Taxpayers will take the bill? GOP takes from social security & national parks to pay for it? Darkest most shameful period in US since slavery
6722 2018-01-05 23:57:32 Earth's outer atmosphere becomes an expert level stunt course complete with land mines and oil slicks and boost pads like it's F-Zero
6723 2018-01-05 23:57:31 what does coconut oil do?? 
6724 2018-01-05 23:57:28 California needs to prevent the oil industry from drilling off our coast!
6725 2018-01-05 23:57:23 GOP @RepAndyHarrisMD supports off shore drilling. What will the Maryland beaches look like after the oil spill?  Probably a lot worse than Wind Mills out in the ocean which Andy didn't support.
6726 2018-01-05 23:57:22 Omg I don't know how to tolerate shaved! So itchy and weird. Don't shampoo them but try oil. Like coconut or shea butter.
6727 2018-01-05 23:57:17 Energy demand can't and won't be met by RE for many decades. Responsible producers reinvest in their development. There are few of these but @phcouillard from Quebec is trying to follow in Norway's footsteps to use revenue from gas to advance RE. Will oil exporters do the same?
6728 2018-01-05 23:57:11 #Kandre, this pairing makes as much sense as oil and water, they don’t damn mix. Miss me with this foolishness. #Days
6729 2018-01-05 23:56:44 Grapeseed oil is so much better.
6730 2018-01-05 23:56:44 Oil comes from the earth! Not only is it organic, but it spills out into the ocean all the time, and has been for thousands of years.

Texas and other oil states should decrease oil deliveries to california

6741 2018-01-05 23:54:55 And apparently the federal barrel tax that the oil industry pays to ensure we can respond  to major oil spills and be compensated for  damages expired. At the same time as this. And a roll back if drilling safety laws. Triple whammy. Are you acting on all three Derek?
6742 2018-01-05 23:54:53 my oil filter is stuck and now I'm sitting inside to warm my hands up and I honestly might just abandon my car in my driveway forever

6745 2018-01-05 23:54:40 Cut all funding and drill baby.. no one from California can work the rigs only people from out of state. Hop in your cars and come visit the view..oh wait u will need oil and gas for them.
6746 2018-01-05 23:54:29 @meinekecarcare very bad service at my local Meineke in Boiling Springs, SC. Got brakes and oil change, charged for brakes and oil change $320, got Home and oil was dirty and old filter still on vehicle! Then treated like crap when I went back to complain! #unhappy customer

6755 2018-01-05 23:53:35 Sounds like a good start.
We've needed to be energy independent. I can recall the Arab oil embargo. We had plenty of oil on the ground to meet our needs. Considering the resources we have, there is no excuse. I like the policy of America First. Unlike the Clinton Crime Foundation

6760 2018-01-05 23:52:32 By the way, where do you think you are gonna come up with the gas, & the oil to keep your car running if we just stopped drilling?

6764 2018-01-05 23:52:09 IEA a reputable source for information on this topic? "International Energy Agency (IEA)'s scenarios, predict that the world will use more oil each year through at least 2040. if the world goes beyond the aggressive commitments made in Paris and achieves the 2C Global goal..."
6765 2018-01-05 23:52:09 Hahahaha!
6766 2018-01-05 23:52:08 Wow. You believe that was an attack on the beef industry lol. Using less plastic bags is an attack on the oil industry too I suppose. The UCP has such a brainless base in this province they will likely get a few votes.
6767 2018-01-05 23:51:53 I swear by taking oil of oregano as soon as I start to feel sick!! Cuts the time I'm sick in half!
6768 2018-01-05 23:51:43 New scandal rocked #ableg late Friday when #NDP Transport Min. @BMasonNDP suggested Albertans could consider mass transit as a viable travel option.

6769 2018-01-05 23:51:34 I used to have to walk a 50 litre metal pot filled with hot fryer oil down a 25' greasy ramp at the end of the night with nothing but a pair of oven mitts.  Thankfully I worked my way out of that type of #minimumwage job. You can too.

6771 2018-01-05 23:51:07 I agree the oil indusry would rather kill us and the environment with car emissions than get on board with the electric and solar cars concept
6772 2018-01-05 23:50:58 Throw some oil on a Caesar salad and eat it. You’re welcome.

In a nuclear flash, the strategic choke point was free from alien control. Oil could once again fuel the war machines. It was a new beginning.

 #SciFiFri
6776 2018-01-05 23:50:26 If you look into the oil price dropping which is the biggest factor of what happened in Alberta you'll see the Americans production from fracking skyrocket as it's relatively cheap ~$35-50 to be profitable, the oil fields here it's more $60+ a barrel needed to be profitable
6777 2018-01-05 23:50:19 I was asking this through the primaries. My question is, why didn’t enough other Americans see the crazy snake oil salesman for what he was.
6778 2018-01-05 23:50:10 Funny and all of you drive cars and purchase items everyday that need oil and gas . Stupid !
6779 2018-01-05 23:50:05 The price of oil ended 2017 at $60.12 a barrel, up +12% (and $6.40 a barrel) from its 2016 close of $53.72. The $60.12 price was the first daily close above $60 a barrel since 6/24/15  @CMEGroup #Oil
6780 2018-01-05 23:50:05 100 - 17 = 83

83% of our oil is drilled domestically. We need to become energy independent and are at the moment, but fossil fuels doesn't accomplish that. There is but only so much in the ground we can get to. It WILL run out. That's how it works. We need sustainable ways.
6781 2018-01-05 23:49:47 None. Oil has never been an impetus for war, merely a factor in the victor’s hand.
6782 2018-01-05 23:49:39 Susan may have heard this from people like Norma Smith, a Twitter-averse representative from Skagit who supports state-made solar. Other Rs support EVs bc EVs don’t use foreign oil. Susan and Trump would like to go to war @ home for oil rather than shed blood abroad.
6783 2018-01-05 23:49:39 Oklahoma legislature are obviously taking from our children to make up for the tax breaks they get personal payoffs for from the oil and gas industries and larger corporations.
6784 2018-01-05 23:49:27 If the cards weren't stacked against Tesla, we would have been so much further ahead. But when the oil industry and short sighted politicians put greed before human and environmental welfare, it becomes another obstacle.
6785 2018-01-05 23:49:25 Just Sayin'...
Ever notice how some of the wealthiest oil families who pushed oil, then said it was bad, are now heavily invested in carbon credit trading? Thanks for believing in AGW and playing their game.
6786 2018-01-05 23:49:24 6 cloves of roasted garlic in extra virgin olive oil. Lots of alkaline water with organic lemons squeezed.
6787 2018-01-05 23:49:17 Ironic, people will have to pay for the spills from oil companies .. the same companies that got their taxes cut ...
6788 2018-01-05 23:49:16 If we are actually entering a "little" ice age, we will need to begin gathering energy sources.  Remember back in 97 when the Clintons sold the Naval Oil Reserves to the company that made the Gore's wealthy, Occidental Petroleum, owned by Dr. Armond Hammer. CA knows how to chill.

6793 2018-01-05 23:48:18 Teatree oil was one of my best purchases of 2017 lmao
6794 2018-01-05 23:48:06 To The Nigerian Federal Government. It has come to my attention that the agricultural tourism, health, science and technology sector, if greatly improved can be a great source of boosting the Nigerian economy.we should try to also reduce crude oil exportation and createoilreserve
6795 2018-01-05 23:47:58 Yup. If you hit an enemy with an Oil Urn, the next hit you do with fire damage will be doubled. Just that one hit, tho.
6796 2018-01-05 23:47:56 Trump doesn't learn anything about the legislation he pushes, because a snake oil salesman doesn't care about the details of the product, they just wing it and spew nonsense until the mark buys it #tytlive

6800 2018-01-05 23:47:20 Who’s to say there will be another oil spill? Think positive stop doubting everyone and everything. He is your president regardless your thoughts. He has earned the right to have his say on things. Have you seen national debt decrease, have you seen unemployment drop.
6801 2018-01-05 23:47:07 Time drags while waiting for the oil guy and the temp in the house is dropping.

6803 2018-01-05 23:46:59 I’m not a geologist and I think anyone who wants to allow oil drilling near the San Andreas fault line might want to check with one.
6804 2018-01-05 23:46:56 only it takes more than two or three hits there. way more. and ALL OF THE MOLOTOVS.
Probably should have used that oil stuff i found that probably buffs fire damage if I know my rpg tropes right.
6805 2018-01-05 23:46:27 I got this argan oil thing for my hair thats supposed to make it less frizzy and I put it in and my hair is still frizzy AND now it looks greasy kms
Bright side, my hair now smells like a cross between clementines and standard hair product. I don't know what to make of this.

6807 2018-01-05 23:46:22 Natural coconut oil!  (harmless for Dora in case she tries to kiss it off!). It's also good for the bottoms of her feet if she walks outside in the cold/snow!
6808 2018-01-05 23:46:20 You forgot one thing in your dissertation. Most of this  is foreign oil correct?
That's the reason why we need to become independent from it.
6809 2018-01-05 23:46:12 @realDonaldTrump Decision to expand oil exploration in protected areas, such as Artic Refuge, is a bad decision. Rescind it. Must balance protecting environment vs. oil corporation profits.
6810 2018-01-05 23:46:06 Going back to the oil field means I gotta shave 
6811 2018-01-05 23:45:57 Yes but if you pass DACA the Republican party is doomed and so are the natural born citizen's, especially our children. Want cheap labor to man the oil and gas in Louisiana? We want to know!
6812 2018-01-05 23:45:54 Looking back, was this really a Hamilton screw up or was he taking orders from the oil company? We hated Hamilton for this decision, but was he just the accountant who was told what decision to make?
6813 2018-01-05 23:45:52 @MichaelBerrySho makeup artist say that coconut oil is the best way to remove glitter from skin...

6815 2018-01-05 23:45:37 If I were a guy, I'd grow a beard. The biggest beard. I'd oil it and stroke it and eventually I'd be able to braid it like a Viking. I'd be a great-looking guy.

You think if you and the Lying GOP repeat a lie enough we the people will just believe it because you said so.
NOT HAPPENING
6822 2018-01-05 23:44:55 I can change oil but I’m not getting under no car to change it tho that’s what mechanic are for

6824 2018-01-05 23:44:36 Tears are burning, threatening to spill as I look at my beloved nation. It’s now a lie. Democracy is dying. The world has viewed us as a mighty country and ally. But @realDonaldTrump @GOP are now pushing limited voting. Pushing oil drilling pushing for money for themselves. I die

6827 2018-01-05 23:44:21 Tillerson - former CEO of major US oil conglomerate - is there Only to help remove any barrier to access to Russian Caspian Oil fields
6828 2018-01-05 23:44:13 What you are missing out on is the fact that we import everything. He is trying to change that. He is trying to bring jobs back to the states. He is trying to decrease our oil prices so we can afford to live. You people look at everything in the most catastrophic instances.
6829 2018-01-05 23:43:49 Are there oil wells out there yet?
6830 2018-01-05 23:43:48 Well if Killery were president, imagine how many dead bodies there would be.
6831 2018-01-05 23:43:31 I found my oil now I’m back feeling like a goddess
6832 2018-01-05 23:43:29 Can use oil of oregano if dont have all the oils for thieves
6833 2018-01-05 23:43:20 SNP triple counting again? I'm sure that field was part of the oil industry projections prior to the referendum.
6834 2018-01-05 23:43:16 My Fortune 250 company is having budget cuts, layoffs, and no raises or bonuses.

How's your oil drilling bribe going?
6835 2018-01-05 23:43:15 This is why we keep those oil radiator heaters in key room. And a pile of blankets on the couch. And snuggly kitties.
6836 2018-01-05 23:43:12 Oy! Oil F.C. are crap! It’s ISIS Utd all the way!
6837 2018-01-05 23:43:11 It might be the best experience you've ever had, BUT, I'mma tell you a less painful way: Oil up the butt
6838 2018-01-05 23:43:11 crude slates; "Crude slate" is the industry term for the list (slate) of all types of crude oil processed by a refinery.
6839 2018-01-05 23:43:03 Corrupt practices BP, etc.  Use RICO against oil companies, their executives in future.  Deepwater Horizon movie dealing with BP.  Congress not care because they are corrupt - bribes from oil companies.  FBI, State Attorney Generals should arrest many members of Congress
6840 2018-01-05 23:42:51 Comparative advantage? Who makes the product matters. Look at emissions from Nigerian oil production v Norwegian. This delusion of yours and environmentalists that shut down oil production in countries with regulations to help emissions does more harm to the environment.
6841 2018-01-05 23:42:50 You dug your grave in the Tundra Next election your sorry butt will be out of politics To destroy the beautiful Alaska landscape for big oil is all about the money. Shame on you!
6842 2018-01-05 23:42:49 I find the oil based one is the best for me.
6843 2018-01-05 23:42:46 I now have a tiny Himalayan salt lamp and essential oil diffuser in my office, in case you were wondering how my anxiety is doing.
6844 2018-01-05 23:42:44 I visited the gulf in the early 1980s there were oil blobs back then
So is it worse? #TaxScamBill
6845 2018-01-05 23:42:40 Obviously oil is the important thing in Trumpland- pipelines, off-shore drilling, artic drilling, land grabs, E.P.A. dissolution, bff's with Saudis, slimy Rosneft deals with Putin/ Tillerson etc. Treasonous Theives. #Resist

6848 2018-01-05 23:42:30 I've tried every valve oil I could get a hold of and I have yet to find one that can compete with Ultra Pure. It is significantly better than blue juice.

6851 2018-01-05 23:42:12 Hey Paul if those companies gave a two dollar in 52wks that would give those employees a yearly salary increase of $4,160.00. One time bonuses are nothing, example to fill an oil tank in New England one time cost of $500.00+. Groceries $300/week. So your tax really sucks!!!

these coins are currency, just like fiat currency.
and just like with fiat currency you can buy items and services with them.

6861 2018-01-05 23:41:18 I can't wait until I'm able to go to furmeets and cons more easily... the main group I talk with is meeting tonight but I had to get an oil change and that took my food and gas money for today. Ehhhhhhh I need a better job. And to live in a bigger city.
6862 2018-01-05 23:41:06 or try tea tree oil and cortizone my keloids were gone in a few days
6863 2018-01-05 23:41:02 Got them all 
6864 2018-01-05 23:40:59 Nice that ignore the question. You would probably eat your own young to save face.
6865 2018-01-05 23:40:39 Putin does not us pushing our natural gas to Europe. He doesnt want us increasing our oil production. It hurts his country & his oil oligarch cronies.

6872 2018-01-05 23:39:48 yeah leave all those high paying oil rig jobs for people who will actually appreciate them

6875 2018-01-05 23:39:33 If you'd have supported @DrJillStein we wouldn't be in this mess. Healthcare as a right, ending wars for oil along w/ fracking & pipelines which are leaking & killing us, war on drugs & pple of color, green jobs. What about her platform didn't you like? #America #WarMachine
6876 2018-01-05 23:39:32 The only reason the stock market is soaring is because your rich cronies are salivating about drilling for oil along our pristine beaches & in our natural wildlife preserves! Who are you kidding??!!
6877 2018-01-05 23:39:27 My favorite mungerism on Disney was always: "[Disney is] an oil company that can put the oil back in the ground after it is done drilling so it can drill it again."
6878 2018-01-05 23:39:22 i got some argan oil body butter so consider it over for you hoes (you hoes meaning my dry ass legs)
6879 2018-01-05 23:39:17 The Trump administration wants to dramatically expand offshore drilling. I guess they forgot about the Gulf of Mexico oil leak! @realDonaldTrump have you considered the environmental impacts?
6880 2018-01-05 23:39:06 Media & "journalists" who keep asking the wrong questions/pouring oil on a bad fire. Add that to a bunch of managers who have ginormous egos and Voila!
6881 2018-01-05 23:38:59 Worst thing about the Saudis: bad, violent losers. They're in self-destruct mode as oil boom doom looms!

Just like how the US empire is going down too, violently, with Trump as its face.
6882 2018-01-05 23:38:58 I’m an admin for a pipeline company but I also have monthly reports for satellites we use to transport oil, and whoever was doing it before me was doing it wrong and has the spreadsheet all messed up and now I’m the one who has to fix it when I’m barley learning it myself
6883 2018-01-05 23:38:58 Trump administration says its plan to DRILL for oil off the coast of #Cascadia and California is to promote "energy DOMINANCE." 
*blinks*
Oh great, another policy based on rich white dudes' feelings of sexual inadequacy.
6884 2018-01-05 23:38:49 Oil have been rough this season. Chiapet’s SCF win has little relation to this season. I’m not saying he should blow up this team, but that he’s been patient with this particular group for far too long this season that now it’s virtually unsalvageable. Ie. why no Sekera stopgap?
6885 2018-01-05 23:38:48 Use an essential oil diffuser. Helps out a lot!!
6886 2018-01-05 23:38:43 "your brain changes as you get older... but [snake oil] helps your brain."
6887 2018-01-05 23:38:40 Mike I wanna keep drilling and building new refineries until we're completely oil independent from the middle east. Let the towel heads drink their own oil and eat their own sand! #DrillBabyDrill

6894 2018-01-05 23:37:37 I wonder how many people have died since 1990 in the name of oil.
6895 2018-01-05 23:37:35 @algore - you are a fraud selling snake oil. You enrich yourself on the backs of hardworking fools who trust you. Your lifestyle betrays your true intentions.
6896 2018-01-05 23:37:33 1) drilling. The more we produce oil & gas, the worse it is for Putin. He was at his most powerful when gas was at $4/gal. DT opening floodgates to energy production. Never mind that Obama & his energy secretary wanted has prices to stay high.
6897 2018-01-05 23:37:22 If course .... EVERY SINGLE THING this congress has done is for the betterment of 1. Trump 2. the wealthiest 3. large corporations 4. oil & gas companies 5. russians 6. big business. 7. themselves

6902 2018-01-05 23:35:57 RR was set to make $6M+, some of that was oil money, but that should be considered part of the equation.

Sumlins buyout was 10.4M, he gets all of that, regardless of taking another gig.

Heeke did his homework prior to firing RR to make sure the money was there

6914 2018-01-05 23:34:00 Canada needs that too but the East loves Saudi Oil rather than their own oil from Canada.  Sad Affair.

6917 2018-01-05 23:33:38 I’m definitely enjoying the comments lol
6918 2018-01-05 23:33:21 If? They want off shore drilling the question is—Where does all the crude go? Or do the oil companies sell it to the foreign market an there is no real benefit to the USA ? Plus Trump believe’s it will not hurt the climate or the shoreline?
6919 2018-01-05 23:33:15 Rump and his never ending push to screw up the environment and give big bucks to big oil.  What a jerk.  Love to impeach.

Do you have a full-sized oven? You can dice a potato, toss with olive oil and salt & pepper, then roast at 425 or so on a roasting pan. They’ll come out super crispy! Not quite fries, but gooooood
6931 2018-01-05 23:31:09 Yeah, also gotta love the "I don't need oil, I ride the bus!" crowd.
6932 2018-01-05 23:31:07 All he is doing is asking us to take care of ourselves. Once we don’t need the Middle East for our oil, then we can get the hell out of there.

6934 2018-01-05 23:30:53 Looks like it was the oil crisis in the late 70's & recession in early 80's where everyone was asked to expect less in order to keep their jobs. I bet we can tie the start of CEO'S obscene salaries to this. Corporations got used to the extra $$ & never looked back.

6947 2018-01-05 23:29:27 This sentence is poorly worded.  "and generators are taking advantage of the rally to burn cheaper oil and coal." It's not cheaper, it's more expensive.  As the weather pushes power prices up, these more expensive coal and oil units that usually sit idle get dispatched.
6948 2018-01-05 23:29:22 Forgetting to turn off my oil heater in my room before going out to work was the best decision I never made.

6962 2018-01-05 23:27:36 Yeah next time go to auto parts and tell them your car and the miles and that you want synthetic oil and buy the filter
6963 2018-01-05 23:27:32 I'm glad it was something that could wait until the storm was over. You might try undiluted lavender oil along with the aloe. My son's abdomen was burned badly years ago. Doctor said he would wear a nasty scar; we kept dowsing it w/ the oil and it's hardly noticeable.
6964 2018-01-05 23:27:32 Oops. Didn't see this. Tell him to try Guard Oil. They're great

I had some Jimmy Choo body oil around here somewhere
6966 2018-01-05 23:27:19 2/4..do not compare debt vs gdp.  russia and venezuela are prime examples of "bad events can happen quickly(oil market crash)".  greece (because of massive debt) was forced to balance its annual budget, and thus endured severe cutback in services to its ppl
6967 2018-01-05 23:27:13 Cannabis indusyry should have same opportunities as: oil, gas, electric, alcohol, etc.
6968 2018-01-05 23:27:06 I had a dream last night about trying to buy a truly obscenely large container of olive oil.
6969 2018-01-05 23:26:48 They will need to do some oil divining.
6970 2018-01-05 23:26:25 @meinekecarcare I paid for a synthetic oil change and everything that comes with it. Your employees gave me regular oil AND THEN tried to charge me $20 under the table to refill the other fluids I already paid for. You people are going to mess up my engine.
6971 2018-01-05 23:25:56 Maulana ,jam'ussalat because of make up?
6972 2018-01-05 23:25:56 This peppermint oil got my pores wide open
6973 2018-01-05 23:25:44 Funny story... spent hours and hours and a fair amount of money reupholstering an armchair with beautiful material and just spilled oil ALL FUCKING OVER IT. No one speak to me
6974 2018-01-05 23:25:40 I can’t get on with coconut oil, it just makes my hair super greasy and I have to wash it like 3 times to get it out of my hair! :(
6975 2018-01-05 23:25:34 @LAYS i s2g if you think for one second you’re about to take away olive oil & herbs outta stores you better think twice Gina. I was so pissed when y’all stopped making Mediterranean Sea kettle cooked chips and now I’ve finally found a decent flavour since then. YOU BETTER CHILL!
6976 2018-01-05 23:25:29 That's a great idea send the hard-working Tim Hortons workers to the oil patch to make more money sounds like a better choice to me.  We'll see how many they all company accepts... or how many Tim's employees are brave enough
6977 2018-01-05 23:25:24 IU is already playing a 3 game set with Louisville (not a fan) with one game at Lucas Oil. Ideally I’d like to see IU play Kentucky, Ball State and Indiana State (every other year) and then another school like FIU.
6978 2018-01-05 23:25:14 Only correcting a new fan to the game ! Arrived with few barrels of oil from Russia just keeping him up to date 
6979 2018-01-05 23:25:12 So predictable, I knew you’d get to the gay slurs eventually. Now say something positive about hitler, you’re playing to stereotype now
6980 2018-01-05 23:25:10 @realDonaldTrump I voted for you but if there is even one off shore oil accident or any wildlife or sealife hurt, I will turn against you. on that day.
6981 2018-01-05 23:25:06 When the oil change man knows your name :’) lol
6982 2018-01-05 23:25:04 Rub coconut oil all over that noggin
6983 2018-01-05 23:25:04 If these thugs didn't have oil, they would still be wandering the desert having carnal knowledge of their animals.

6988 2018-01-05 23:24:09 Hmmmm let’s think about that shall we?
Largest untapped oil reserve in THE WORLD just discovered off the Shetland Coast 

Aye, we’re stuffed mate 

That is, unless we cut the parasites loose 
6989 2018-01-05 23:24:06 I done put all this wild growth hair oil and Jamaican black castor oil on em as if that’s gone make it completely grow back over night. 
6990 2018-01-05 23:23:59 You can’t out slick a can of oil
6991 2018-01-05 23:23:50 Potatoes, oil, salt. Tell me if you've ever heard of a better triad.

6992 2018-01-05 23:23:48 Apparently American soldiers dying for oil is cute to Howard

6996 2018-01-05 23:23:23 This cold a*! weather called for something to warm my bones. Basic Peanut Butter cookies with lavender, ground cloves, little hot coco mix,  and little almond oil. YUM I love when my baking experiments work!
6997 2018-01-05 23:23:21 The heater from my car smelt like olive oil at one point
6998 2018-01-05 23:23:20 Tanks... the oil rigs will be 40 miles offshore, you won’t be able to see them.
6999 2018-01-05 23:23:05 I went to get an oil change on my car and the shop said it was too ugly for an oil change. Fucked up bruh.
7000 2018-01-05 23:22:53 Exactly ! So many rumors went on then
7001 2018-01-05 23:22:33 I hope you follow through with your opposition to oil drilling off Maine and entire East Coast.
7002 2018-01-05 23:22:23 Salmond also told all that Scotland had "a second oil boom" coming.  How did that work out ? 
7003 2018-01-05 23:22:19 29 years this March the Exxon Valdez entered Alaska's Prince William Sound full of crude oil, and struck a reef, tearing its hull to dump 11m gallons of oil - one of the largest/widest spills, which still has residue below the surface on many beaches.
7004 2018-01-05 23:22:15 No I work 12 hours a day in the oil sands they don't work as hard as me and they don't deserve the same benefits I have if they did industry would fall apart. Lots of jobs in oil right now they can come better their lives or stay working 40 hour a week and complain
7005 2018-01-05 23:22:06 Oil, coal, and natural gas are cheaper and more efficient than solar, wind, and water will be for the next 20 years.
7006 2018-01-05 23:22:03 You might need to sell some oil rights to help with all those “royal” illegal protected immigrants you “sanctuary”. WE REMEMBER! #KateSteinle
7007 2018-01-05 23:22:00 #Soap is the oldest natural detergent. It has an anionic nature. It is produced by a chemical reaction between lye + a fatty acid or an oil.
7008 2018-01-05 23:21:52 Or coconut oil
7009 2018-01-05 23:21:49 I tell all my friends take pictures of their cars before and mark your oil filter with a sharpie with the date and miles you last changed it and check it before you leave the lot.
7010 2018-01-05 23:21:43 Why is the Great USA moving to more oil production when the rest of the planet is going Green(like China)? We're getting left behind! #CAoffshoredrilling #Oldschool #USisadinosaur
7011 2018-01-05 23:21:40 But what's with the fire issue always,I just wonder
7012 2018-01-05 23:21:40 It has very little to do with a president without corporate ties. 
Rex Tillerson CEO of Exxon Mobil, Sec. of state, and his ties to Russian Oil, (40% of its exports)
Oil prices increase when there is unrest in middle East. Profit for Tillerson and Putin. The more you know.
7013 2018-01-05 23:21:33 Welcome to the best country on the east coast u have nice summers n cold winters on the west u have warm weather most of the year with lil to no snow or cold n in the middle is the worst of both n very flat full of oil rigs big city's thou
7014 2018-01-05 23:21:23 It may sound weird but I put a few drops rosehip seed oil on my face before foundation.  I have super dry skin and I'm alot older than you (43) so i have some lines around my eyes & mouth...it's not 100% but it does plump up the skin so there's less product in my smile lines.
7015 2018-01-05 23:21:14 Maybe EXXON OIL SPILLING PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND DESTROYING TILLERSON OUGHT TO QUESTION HIS OWN MENTAL INSTABILITY
7016 2018-01-05 23:21:11 The guy is a snake oil salesman. Sound like more fusion GPS horseshit to me.

7019 2018-01-05 23:20:50 Oooh. Taxi drivers aren't gonna like this. They've already suffered during the oil crisis. Could be good for users though. Taxis are so expensive here. Then again, how are drivers supposed to cope with the high living expenses up here? 
7020 2018-01-05 23:20:43 Why are they in Yemen? Why do they block the way for humanitarian aid to babies? Why do they want Yemen land? What do they gain from this war on little babies? Money!! Oil! A route to cause more death and distruction! I would not doubt Kushner is behind this somehow!
7021 2018-01-05 23:20:40 There is no such thing as Sudanese! There are only tribes in Africa which is why they are constantly at war with each other! Not religion not borders not oil not commerce
7022 2018-01-05 23:20:35 Imagine another BP explosion & leak, can't use any of the beaches because of oil spills & wash up, the seafood industry decimated by oil covered seafood, fish, etc., dead sea life washed ashore daily. Children will remember as adults all of this.
7023 2018-01-05 23:20:35 If the EU is "Nazi and xenophobic" then that really doesn't leave adjectives available to describe Get Britain Out, Farage and 90% of the Leave campaign.
The winter of discontent was caused by the Oil Crisis, triggered by OPEC's massive oil price hike and the subsequent inflation
7024 2018-01-05 23:20:12 How will we pay for oil spills? 9 cents per barrel is NOT much for an oil company to invest to cover these future costs. Will it now fall to taxpayers?
7025 2018-01-05 23:20:08 not Canadian, but I started using The Ordinary products this fall: glycolic acid, niacinamide, rosehip oil, and vitamin C, definitely recommend the first three, jury's still out on the vitamin C!
7026 2018-01-05 23:20:06 Sessions is the weasel and Ryan is the Hatchet man.
Pence is the snake and Trump is the Fake
Big oil is the winner and our planet is the loser. 
Not in my best interest and I would be not yours either.
7027 2018-01-05 23:19:57 They’re pulling this same crap with oil industry and pipelines.
7028 2018-01-05 23:19:47 Right next to Lucas Oil
7029 2018-01-05 23:19:47 That is awesome, we no longer will be dependent on foreign oil. It will create jobs and more growth. Excellent!
7030 2018-01-05 23:19:46 A liberal looks in his refrigerator and exclaims, "OMG, we're going to run out of food in TWO WEEKS!" 

What do these fools want us to do? Pull ALL the oil out of the ground all at once? And put it where? 
7031 2018-01-05 23:19:44 Once I’ve drowned my face in bio oil, it’s khalas. Nothing will make me leave my bed.

7033 2018-01-05 23:19:21 Where & how do we get CBD oil in Georgia?

7035 2018-01-05 23:19:12 Sir...Nigeria can't or Nigeria won't...refine its oil... There is a difference please you people know it!
7036 2018-01-05 23:19:10 Literally took them forever to change my oil smh
7037 2018-01-05 23:19:06 (#^-^)ﾒﾗ…ﾒﾗﾒﾗ…
7038 2018-01-05 23:18:57 No. It shows he is controlled by Putin and must push oil. To eventually open up the arctic to the 500 billion deal that Tillerson negotiated with Putin himself. They have to drill the oil before oil goes obsolete.
7039 2018-01-05 23:18:52 I use cannabis infused coconut oil to make my skin stop hurting.
I don't look 57 either! That cannabis is the fountain of youth. Fibro pain & PTSD ARE GOOD WITH LG DOSES OF ORGANIC SATIVA.
7040 2018-01-05 23:18:51 How I spent MY last 2 days: Drink organic green tea with coconut oil and cayenne pepper; eat veggie chili; take supplements; check social media; post and tweet and share and retweet; shovel snow; play with son; eat dinner; play with son; REPEAT; Day 2: REPEAT! Day 3???
7041 2018-01-05 23:18:48 wish oil was the same thing, use Alberta oil in Canada at least
7042 2018-01-05 23:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
7043 2018-01-05 23:18:21 I'm not for smoking marijuana, but medical cannabis/cannabidiol oil should be for autism, seizures, alzheimers, parkinsons, autoimmune disorders, neurological disorders, encephalopathy, arthritis, ect.
7044 2018-01-05 23:18:19 Lets come up with a master list of all the expenses that are normally higher with an SUV.

-Gas
-Oil changes
-Car washes

7045 2018-01-05 23:18:19 Dating a married man is cool and fun until you discover that he saved your number as engine oil or spare parts
7046 2018-01-05 23:18:16 As long as there is a demand for plastics (including battery casings), artificial fertilisers and fuel for heavy-duty machinery (including agriculture), I suspect Big Oil will survive...
7047 2018-01-05 23:18:12 Will oil be drilled in front of Trump's beach front properties?? @realdonaldtrump #dumpoilontrump #impeachtrump
7048 2018-01-05 23:18:02 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
7049 2018-01-05 23:17:52 You gonna walk every where u go? If so, good. You won t need oil
7050 2018-01-05 23:17:48 Our furnace is running almost non-stop here in Boston. Single digit temps expected through weekend. Northeast US is center of US heating oil demand.
7051 2018-01-05 23:17:32 Tea tree oil is so sick
7052 2018-01-05 23:17:28 Sounds like you need to get the  oil out or are those birds chirping lol

7057 2018-01-05 23:16:33  hella baby oil
7058 2018-01-05 23:16:15 Lmao I told you bring your own oil
7059 2018-01-05 23:16:09 So, you were against off shore drilling near Florida before, @marcorubio but now you are?  Why?  Are those oil companies your political donors?  You thief!
7060 2018-01-05 23:15:56 u ran over something? i just got my brakes fixed/oil changed and now my check engine light on smh
7061 2018-01-05 23:15:45 Oil company employees that work with trade secret/classified/sensitive info have not been allowed personal cellphones for years....and the govt has just thought of this?
7062 2018-01-05 23:15:40 i just read the word beard oil and i gagged a little.. i don't know why either and i know it's dramatic but in my defence certain words are just icky
7063 2018-01-05 23:15:31 All these other people getting an oil change on Friday night really need to get a life.
7064 2018-01-05 23:15:22 Ndp says downturn was due to oil slump. How can they now claim it was their policies that brought economy back?  It is cyclical. Just as it was oil taking it down, it is oil bringing it back up. Ndp is not much different than PCs were on oil rollercoaster politics.
7065 2018-01-05 23:15:20 Making the same entities that arrives is always implies the pulse of real-world events Oil is a philosophical and archaeologies.
7066 2018-01-05 23:15:19 Exactly. It’d been a year and a half since my last service. $50 doesn’t even cover an oil change.
7067 2018-01-05 23:15:19 I don't think it's rings. I doubt it would start and run in the cold if you had *that* much blowby plus a lot of the oil would be burning and you'd get clouds of oily smoke not an oil spray. Might even be a cracked housing.
7068 2018-01-05 23:15:12 It’s one of my favorite Whole30 recipes. When I make the sliders, I always have arugula with a little olive oil and lemon juice. The cauliflower rice would definitely be good with the tacos your making.
7069 2018-01-05 23:15:02 I just started using hyluronic acid and marula oil. I love the combo because I have dry skin, my friend with oily uses the rosehip seed oil and she loves it
7070 2018-01-05 23:14:59 We need Oil till 2100.... renewables are not efficient enough and what have you done to support environmental companies in your State, remember Cereplast?
7071 2018-01-05 23:14:43 The oil and gas industry doesn't really care about new technologies to help stop future blowouts! We know that firsthand! They only care about new drilling technologies! Safety and mitigation gets very little attention or money! Even the government doesn't really care about it!
7072 2018-01-05 23:14:41 This tree oil is making nauseous 
7073 2018-01-05 23:14:30 Guys, oil companies are liable to fund spill cleanup regardless of this Tax.

Nothing changed, but way to rile people up.
7074 2018-01-05 23:14:26 You do know that the US is a net EXPORTER of oil, right?
7075 2018-01-05 23:14:18 My mood of 2018: frankincense essential oil
7076 2018-01-05 23:14:13 "i'll give myself paper cuts with your poem so your skin oil enters my blood stream."
7077 2018-01-05 23:14:08 Thank you for the kind thoughts. I thought the same thing, kicking myself that I haven't made a true batch of Rick Simpson Oil yet, but I have access to something similar.
7078 2018-01-05 23:14:03 Sorry @mom1398 I still have a job and my health care is fully paid for. What are you going to tell that to your children when they go bankrupt from health care bills. "Oh sorry, We were worried that Wall Street would'n't get its way." Boo Hoo Hoo.
7079 2018-01-05 23:13:57 He’s not.  Oil have been pretty rough this year.  Do you not think a GM with a Stanley cup ring could not blow the crap out of the team if he chose to?
C’mon man.  Blame the players (maybe the coach but I don’t believe he’s to blame) but this ain’t on Chiarelli.  IMHO of course.
7080 2018-01-05 23:13:56 @Cori__Paige, I went with a labneh Koroneiki olive oil combo. It was completely luxurious.

7088 2018-01-05 23:12:26 Sounds like you had the 4-day PR treatment. Are you sure your experience wasn't the product of warm weather, private jet, hypnotism & snake oil salesmanship? @RichFeloni
7089 2018-01-05 23:12:22 any damn way you want nig!!! just dont use oil & shit like dat to cook them
7090 2018-01-05 23:12:16 Donalt: Until you close your eyes, put ear plugs in and shut your mouth, you will never see the skill that Trump has. Now open your eyes and you will see that America is getting GREAT again but you have to keep the mouth shut or you won't see it. 
7091 2018-01-05 23:11:55 LOL Have you seen the offshore oil drilling currently in operation? Why not work to close it ALL down? What? Hello?
7092 2018-01-05 23:11:44 #whenifeelguilty for eating too much oil or butter I eat cranberries to poop the guilt out.
7093 2018-01-05 23:11:39 Not a war on science. A war on waste and spending on total crap that accomplishes absolutely nothing. New cost effective technology developments in the private sector will be the only way to change oil consumption. You can’t quit oil with no replacement.

7095 2018-01-05 23:11:05 Wolff is a modern day snake oil salesman getting rich selling hysterical Libs his book as the cure for Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS). Instead it is hearsay and wishful thinking that he even admits is not all true designed to capitalize on these TDS lost souls.
7096 2018-01-05 23:11:04 They tried to sell their snake oil to @JacLaurita & she told them to go scratch. But #TheWretched is rolling in their leaky bag of shit. . . Until show ends.

7102 2018-01-05 23:10:17 Got it, it's ok to us oil as long as it doesn't come from here.

7105 2018-01-05 23:10:08 @realDonaldTrump 
You thank god I don't have Billions because I buy 8 oil drill platform's park them 4 Mar-a-lago, 4 bed minister, hire oil crews 'not to drill' just run the machinery, be as loud as hell 24-7.
7106 2018-01-05 23:10:06 Thanks for the tip, I've got a small batch of oil of something else in coconut that I plan on applying at bedtime around applications of what the doc gave me. These two would go real well with it in a biblical sort of way
7107 2018-01-05 23:09:59 This place has zero insulation
Why rent is cheap
Killing me with oil
Now water pipes frozen
They'll finally insulate this fucking house
7108 2018-01-05 23:09:54 Yes! We are all filthy rich! Oh... wait... nope. Just Trump's oil and gas buddies are getting rich.  Damn.
7109 2018-01-05 23:09:53 New year-new me!
I have started my own business as a Essential Oil Advocate. 
If your wondering what all the fuss is about with this wonderful all natural product PM me for the details. I’m extremely excited about the products and would love to share them with you. 
Contact me.
7110 2018-01-05 23:09:48 We all were so happy when they closed them all down on our Cali Coast. We don't need anymore oil! We need Solar/Wind & other alternatives to fossil fuels.Citizens better wake up here,all join together ALL OF US to save our country & planet from all Greedy-Trumps of the World!
7111 2018-01-05 23:09:48 You can make your own with sugar + oil (jojoba is good, very similar to natural sebum, avoid olive or coconut, they're very comedogenic). Much cheaper & just as effective.
7112 2018-01-05 23:09:47 Liverpool fans going crazy about winning the Merseyside Derby.........like it fucking matters, it's a win pretty much every game for them. It's not a competative game. Like the Manchester one used to be before that arab oil / blood money came in.
7113 2018-01-05 23:09:38 Do you sell bulk olive oil?
7114 2018-01-05 23:09:30 Jamaican black castor oil can help
7115 2018-01-05 23:09:28 This coconut oil is just not sufficing in this arctic weather. Where’s the Vaseline?!
7116 2018-01-05 23:09:27 im not a fan of coconut oil either.
7117 2018-01-05 23:09:19 The state too, it’s all a lost shithole. Watching it slowly rot from my window.
7118 2018-01-05 23:09:16 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
7119 2018-01-05 23:09:01 Florida makes big bucks in tourism and pristine beaches. Oil soaked beaches would mess that up financially for the state big time
7120 2018-01-05 23:08:56 .... and while you are at it, F that state. :-(
7121 2018-01-05 23:08:49 No, the oil companies funnily enough 
7122 2018-01-05 23:08:32 Mr Modi inherited 6.9% GDP FROM @INCIndia in 2014. After 4 years, he has brought it down to 6.5%. He has failed. Period. Despite lowest oil prices and a growing world economy. Vote #BJP out in 2019.  They are a disaster.
7123 2018-01-05 23:08:27 Erm, that isn't what it says at all. It says repeated DPF regen cycles (which for some reason puts fuel in oil) due to interruptions (shorter journeys) can cause premature service intervals and to do the service free as a courtesy to avoid complaints!

7125 2018-01-05 23:08:19 Our friend of the salt have sent Timothy, according to battle of God of the Greeks took oil and leave the world unto you,
7126 2018-01-05 23:08:16 Oil prices are high, now is not the time for carbon tax, oil prices low, now is not the time for carbon tax. Now is not the time = never
7127 2018-01-05 23:08:16 I would like to thank Donald J. Trump & the modern day GOP for proving that everything we’ve said about them for years to be true. 

They’re snake oil salesmen, who don’t care about our country. They care about money and corporations, lie relentlessly and do anything to deflect.
7128 2018-01-05 23:08:11 Umm... who was it who begged WM for tax cuts to help the ailing oil industry? Oh, wait, it was the SNP...
7129 2018-01-05 23:08:02 Need to oil my scalp tonight
7130 2018-01-05 23:07:52 You can catch me in a car parts store with my dad dancing to a bop from the 80s while he shops for motor oil

7134 2018-01-05 23:07:04 any one else find it interesting that the only person to come out today and say that the president is not crazy is the man who comes from Exxon?   Same day that the offshore drilling was approved.  What's his investment in Oil futures?

7137 2018-01-05 23:06:53 We can only hope that the Florida oil spill washes up on the shores of Mar-a-Lago.
7138 2018-01-05 23:06:52 @POTUS @RealDonaldTrump @Senate @Congress @GOP @FoxNews @NBC @CBS @CNN  Florida's Governor Rick  Scott Opposess OIL Drilling In The Oceans Surrounding USA!
7139 2018-01-05 23:06:51 He's worried about tourism and oil spills.  Bad combo.
7140 2018-01-05 23:06:45 Tourism $ drop when you have an oil spill.
7141 2018-01-05 23:06:44 The new #GOPTaxBillScam  allows oil companies to avoid paying for the clean up of spills.
7142 2018-01-05 23:06:37 Can't believe we have only one offshore wind farm but want to lease everything for oil. So behind.
7143 2018-01-05 23:06:31 Oil of Olay make up wipe remover sheets. Pre moistened. Lol.  Easy peasy, save those lashes AND your face!
7144 2018-01-05 23:06:13 Oil drilling platforms ruin that sweet ocean view, and kill tourism. I suppose that's the only reason he's opposed to it.
7145 2018-01-05 23:06:10 Paid my rent, got my oil changed , and groceries  and weed delivered, I love payday
7146 2018-01-05 23:05:44 I’m getting the cars oil changed by myself, and I feel like an adult. Let me just tell you right now, I don’t like it
7147 2018-01-05 23:05:38 Exactly. They always try and get u to change your oil and brake fluid as well. Or they’ll tell you to replace your brakes.. check your car manual. It knows more than a mechanic
7148 2018-01-05 23:05:26 Why do they use peanut oil? 
7149 2018-01-05 23:05:23 Al Gore, International Snake Oil Salesman and climatology’s Wizard of Oz is acting shocked when someone peeks behind the global warming facade and sees that the wizard is fake. He doth protest too much!

7151 2018-01-05 23:04:37 So is your conspiracy theory that HMRC hid the £bns of oil revenue under orders from WM? Or all the oil companies decided to falsify their tax returns by £bns? Or that they spent the money but not on exploration or investment but on something else?
7152 2018-01-05 23:04:36 Thinking about trading in my BMW.... my oil change messed my mind uob

7155 2018-01-05 23:04:23 And giving huge tax breaks to oil companies isn’t the same as making them pay the level of tax they should be paying. Yoonatics the lot if you 
7156 2018-01-05 23:04:19 Having grown up on the Oregon coast, I've often thought that the one thing they were missing was a nice coating of oil. Really softens those gritty sand particles, you know?
7157 2018-01-05 23:04:18 slay, queen. Systematically slay the whales for lamp oil.

7160 2018-01-05 23:03:59 I love going to einstiens for my oil changes these boys are always dressed so fine 
7161 2018-01-05 23:03:56 Beli essential oil spearmint/peppermint next time. Just drop in you cuppa tea and enjoy! 
7162 2018-01-05 23:03:53 My hair dries wavy but frizzy, I just apply some leave in oil to tame the frizz. Keratin is good though
7163 2018-01-05 23:03:52 Have always been told you need a generational talent to approach dynasty status. The Oil are not even close.
7164 2018-01-05 23:03:37 Argan Oil!
7165 2018-01-05 23:03:34 WH Press Sec. Sarah Sanders~You sound UNAMERICAN to ME. When will your boss bring forth new ideas~Everything Pres DJT has done; comes from the 1950's & 1980's. Think Ahead & remember US 1st Amendment Rights-Free Speech. US doesn't need more Offshore Oil Exploration or Drilling.
7166 2018-01-05 23:03:29 A little upset that I just had to get out of my car for my oil change....
7167 2018-01-05 23:02:57 Fuck you. reap the fucking whirlwind you hypocritical fuck. You don't get to fuck over the rest of the country and be outraged your states might be damaged from corporate greed. If I knew where you lived I would fill a crop duster full of used motor oil and dump it on your house.

7169 2018-01-05 23:02:44 I dont know about the rest of you,but drilling oil rigs in the ocean is just plain crazy. We are smart enough to build things that dont need all the oil we use. I already know how to build a car that doesn't use fuel. Its quite simple.

7176 2018-01-05 23:02:06 Petroleum companies would like initiatives that show they are concerned, but do not effect their production or markets, unfortunately they don't work. If oil from a country with cleaner operations, displaces another supplier, that supplier will simply sell to a different customer
7177 2018-01-05 23:02:04 And you probably think Fox (Faux) news is accurate.
7178 2018-01-05 23:02:01 that was a butane explosion at an oil refinery in kitimat but i imagine it's similar

7180 2018-01-05 23:01:49 Oil spills don’t interest the administration. Just oil revenue.
7181 2018-01-05 23:01:42 Well let’s hope you’re good for your word on this one. Flip and we will be sure to name  the first devastating oil spill after you. Maine has had it with you. Don’t sell us out on this issue too. #mepolitics #voteherout #nomargaretchasesmith

7187 2018-01-05 23:01:25 I've got the skin tone that might as well be lathered in cooking oil it burns so easily. Sunburn is the worst.
7188 2018-01-05 23:01:24 Isn't everything simply a fact of modern life?  Nuclear weapons? High fructose corn syrup? Oil spills? 

The simple facts of their existence creates necessity to deal with them so they don't destroy us.

7192 2018-01-05 23:01:09 Why did the Kochs jump the gun in trying a takeover of the US? Their 2 major revenue sources are declining rapidly. Coal and oil. They are aging and losing the battle of time. It will cost them dearly.
7193 2018-01-05 23:01:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however total chaos and lawlessness.

7197 2018-01-05 23:00:40 Lol! Ohhh okay yeah that’s wack AF lol. I feel like I’ve talked to someone who was kinda like that. Be like “oh I have to take me 2015 Benz in for an oil change”  you couldn’t just say you gotta get an oil change. Also, I didn’t ask 
7198 2018-01-05 23:00:38 Where is my baby oil
7199 2018-01-05 23:00:18 Gas prices will likely go up this winter due to the demand in oil.

7211 2018-01-05 22:59:08 @algore Consider buying big oil stocks. Should do (oil) well over the next eight years. 
7212 2018-01-05 22:59:08 Spot on pal. Russia & China have had enough of US bovine excrement. They are checkmating the US globally. Wait until China starts buying oil from Iran with Chinese currency & the Dollar collapses. Difficult times ahead.

7216 2018-01-05 22:59:01 Directionally I kind of get it but I think we’re still one or two oil cycles out from being a real investable thesis. Renewables are overhyped, for the climate AND as an investment
7217 2018-01-05 22:58:50 And 3 days later Trump opens up virtually the entire US continental shelf to oil drilling. Go figure!

7219 2018-01-05 22:58:47 @NNPCgroup, as a cooperation, you have the capacity to give Sub-sahara Africa oil at no cost if you got your act right.
7220 2018-01-05 22:58:47 Well, at least you're honest
7221 2018-01-05 22:58:44 @SenMarkey was on TV today blasting the oil drilling decision.
7222 2018-01-05 22:58:39 In the 70s climate change hysterics said we would be out of oil and in a new ice age. Now we are supposed to believe the rewritten repackaged fear mongering of global warming.Leave your mansion and maybe you will be credible and not a hypocrite.
7223 2018-01-05 22:58:30 Definitely, we’ll hopefully see economic figures that this time don’t include oil revenues and a cross party promoted white paper for independence. In a time of possible economic decline and Brexit, independence doesn’t need to be Yes v No, more what makes sense individually
7224 2018-01-05 22:58:23 I anoint my self with Oil, my cup truly runneth over.

7226 2018-01-05 22:57:59 Booked an appointment at 1:00 for an oil change and light replacement and it’s still not done four hours later. not cool @pepboysauto
7227 2018-01-05 22:57:54 Look at the reports from the oil companies talking about investing in capital project, exploration and appraisal during that timeframe.

7230 2018-01-05 22:57:37 I think I figured it out for my skin. Rosehip oil before foundation  #moisture
7231 2018-01-05 22:57:35 oh, and the rose hip seed oil is amazing and a fraction of the price of some other brands. it's great on its own or mixed in with moisturizer.
7232 2018-01-05 22:57:22  I remember one episode, they were forced to have a bath and the water turned dark brown, and one greedy man, or was it his dad , anyway, thought it was oil so he tried extorting them for it only to later find out it was dirt from their bodies

7242 2018-01-05 22:56:09 @ASavageNation after BP LA rig blew, shrimp harvested for 2 yrs aft had OIL in their intestinal tract, NOT SEA WEED!!!
7243 2018-01-05 22:55:46 Once scotch whisky exports and oil and fish are effected nicola will have to act . If northern ireland get there special status it will all kick off.  Its just what will she do. Reckon aug 2018 for the scottish issue to clarify. @NicolaSturgeon
7244 2018-01-05 22:55:42 I jus take it by Taco Bell to get the oil change d:
7245 2018-01-05 22:55:28 I had some of the worst pot stickers I’ve ever had in my life last night. My stomach is still hurting from it. It was like biting into an oil sponge.
7246 2018-01-05 22:55:20 Trump-Putin-Tillerson arctic oil drilling deal. Its the reason Tillerson is there
7247 2018-01-05 22:55:17 Both GOP and DEMS are evil. Just that the Republicans are worse. They blatantly block better work conditions you and me . Only people who are rich and foreign investors will benefit. Open your eyes. I could care less about Hilary's house.
7248 2018-01-05 22:55:06 Yes but this will keep all your elite friends in gas and oil to operate multiple mansions and private jet fleet.
7249 2018-01-05 22:55:03 But we are in a helpless situation. The govt refused to privatise the already existing ones. so what do we do. Safe to say Dangote is our Oil Messiah
7250 2018-01-05 22:55:02 The price of Oil will soon dip below $50 again!
7251 2018-01-05 22:55:01 tons of people rave about clary sage oil and how it stops period cramps almost instantly if you rub 2-3 drops on yourself and they aren’t lying. it gave me almost immediate relief the first time I used it for an *endo belly* episode. go get a $5 bottle.

7253 2018-01-05 22:54:32 Oil makes up the majority of our energy production, then natural gas, then nuclear energy, then lastly solar hydro and ect, at least last time i checked
7254 2018-01-05 22:54:27 So getting rid of gas solves your issues? From what? Smog? Guess what the wind blows and air pollution goes everywhere. Doing it to get away from oil? Then better find a new way to make plastic bags, bottles, fleece, sunglasses, pleather...all oil byproducts. @californiasucks
7255 2018-01-05 22:54:22 Hot shower, slathered up with coconut oil for my itchy winter skin, already in bed with bourbon on the night stand. 

Happy Friday Night!

7257 2018-01-05 22:54:09 Gluten is the stem of all my skin issues. Even products that contain wheat germ oil cause an immediate reaction. #GlutenFree #GlutenIsTheDevil
7258 2018-01-05 22:53:56 Your username and bio shook me, but my dish tasted so damn good that I’m going to tell you anyway; rice, eggs, beef, peas, spring onions, sesame oil, soy sauce etc. Hit all the spots.
7259 2018-01-05 22:53:55 Some olive oil, coconut, and butter for me is about it.
7260 2018-01-05 22:53:49 Agreed . And we don't need eyesores off Americas coast drilling oil.
7261 2018-01-05 22:53:41 The soap can be found @ Walmart! Like by the Burt’s bees stuff..& the tea tree oil I found at heb but it’s cheaper at cvs! I personally can’t get used to the smell lol but if you just dab a lil once you see a pimple coming along, that’s all it takes
7262 2018-01-05 22:53:38 By "how to deal" I'm guessing that means caving on Trump's wishes on oil pipelines, military spending and Israel?
7263 2018-01-05 22:53:37 I hope they drill and there's an oil spill that decimates Florida's tourism. Then you can tell the tourists to go swim in your hero Trump's swamp.
7264 2018-01-05 22:53:37 Will Haley be bringing his snake oil to sell?
7265 2018-01-05 22:53:30 She's as accomplish more in her life than any of your family members including you combine. I'm sure your flipping buyers since oil prices are low.
7266 2018-01-05 22:53:20 my cat keeps getting her head stuck in a jar of coconut oil BUT her skin looks great?
7267 2018-01-05 22:53:19 I work in manufacturing for the oil industry, so it's like double masculine. I feel that 100%
7268 2018-01-05 22:53:19 I'd be a poor farmer, half dead coal miner, or if I'm lucky a snake oil salesman that eventually gets shot. 1880s wasn't good to me. #TheFive
7269 2018-01-05 22:53:16 The colossal idiots r those who don’t understand the difference bet. weather & climate & the extreme stress to our oceans caused by rapidly melting freshwater ice & massive oil leaks.Roughly half of Great Barrier Reef coral bed habitat is already dead, and yes it will affect us.
7270 2018-01-05 22:53:14 You can drill for oil now and still see a future with different energy sources. What he is doing it tapping our country’s natural resources to benefit our economy. Suffocating energy doesn’t help in the short or long term.
7271 2018-01-05 22:53:02 Don’t pound the P but absolutely Oil yer neck!
7272 2018-01-05 22:53:00 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Alaska may open up again for oil leasing, but risks linger

7274 2018-01-05 22:52:43 Rose hipseed oil after moisturizer day and night! 
7275 2018-01-05 22:52:43 And if you have the gall to walk to work then you clearly hate the oil industry.
7276 2018-01-05 22:52:37 I just loved rubbing that ass down with babe oil
7277 2018-01-05 22:52:26 That’s a good looking dude
7278 2018-01-05 22:51:55 Really?3.0 GDP,less people on food stamps,business givng bonuses to workers,business coming back to US,ISIS weaken,Wall Street booming,unemployment rate low,getting off foreign oil,putting America interest first,giving Israel finally a Capital,Vets getting help etc..Disaster?LMAO
7279 2018-01-05 22:51:36 Happy Bird Brain Day to you and trump. After you allowed your billionaire logging and oil cronies permission to basically kill and poison the environment? You look at National Parks, pristine land, and fisheries as an opertunity to destroy all for money @nytimes @Lawrence @CNN
7280 2018-01-05 22:51:30 Go around, use leave in conditioner on your beard after showering and comb in some beard oil from time to time
7281 2018-01-05 22:51:25 Then we shouldn’t send our oil to Maine.
7282 2018-01-05 22:51:19 If you think you may have an allergy to anything aloe I’d dilute it with water/essential oil, but use it raw if now. More benefits... you tryna get that glow lol

7285 2018-01-05 22:51:08 Get a sharp enough knife, some nails, and some vegetable oil and you could  craft  it  yourself  so  it’s  organniccccc
7286 2018-01-05 22:51:06 Who else gets nervous dropping their car off at the shop. Fingers crossed my Mini doesn’t need anything besides Aires up tires and an oil change
7287 2018-01-05 22:51:00 Corruption.  Why am I not surprised. 
It's not better over here in the US as well. They're trying to deliberately start a way with Iran again. Why? The typical motivation for greed, oil, market weapons, resources & corrupted religious bullshit agendas.
7288 2018-01-05 22:50:56 I didn’t know MCFC sells oil. Read the link in previous tweet. Looks at just the footballing business.
7289 2018-01-05 22:50:51 That's not bad at all! I think I read somewhere it was weekly, but yeah makes sense if your washing all the time they're going to oil up faster xD
7290 2018-01-05 22:50:51 New additions to the menu... fab. And the Black Oil beer is really good!
7291 2018-01-05 22:50:44 He paid a dollar for his olive oil. Bold dusk.
7292 2018-01-05 22:50:44 The Cannabis CBD oil products I distribute have .3% THC legal in all 50 states for full spectrum effect without the high or dealing with Dr.'s, fees, and does the same thing medicinally.  It works better than the other big pharmacy poisons. I use the Pure CBD without THC myself.
7293 2018-01-05 22:50:41 65% of that oil comes from wells on land and 17% of it is imported. 

Nobody wants to destroy wildlife, but it happens with offshore drilling. Even a small accident is destructive to every possible thing that contacts crude oil or chemicals --it impacts us for generations
7294 2018-01-05 22:50:33 I made a sweet pototoe ,red pepper,onion,courgette,onion ,garlic ,stir fry in olive oil ,add stock,Pasta and at ,The the end and grated Parmesan or cheddar cheese ,

7296 2018-01-05 22:50:24 tell me why i went to get an oil change and they said it’s gonn be a 4 hour wait 
7297 2018-01-05 22:50:22 True.  I understand the need to win as many games possible. Chances for a playoffs spot for the Oil is dissapating fast.
7298 2018-01-05 22:50:19 Dear Nimrata, since you are on this topic of human rights, any comments on the current, recent and past situation in Palestine? Or is there not enough oil and other resources on the land occupied for you to care enough?
7299 2018-01-05 22:50:17 Not until our oil industry is fully deregulated, we will continue to enter crisis at each bend. Support the passage of the #PIB.
7300 2018-01-05 22:50:15 I got a trial sized Filorga Meso-Mask at Christmas. It costs £40 and is a sell out everywhere, but the ingredients include:  Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil) Cetearyl Alcohol and Methylisothiazolinone  

So glad @CarolineHirons taught me to check before I wreck
7301 2018-01-05 22:50:11 "Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
‘Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I’ll rise." - Still I Rise, Maya Angelou (3/3)
7302 2018-01-05 22:50:09 He's proudly full-bearded, but you're so right--I gifted him a nice beard oil and wooden comb recently, and judging from the increased grooming I'm thinking it might be the gateway product to skincare. 
7303 2018-01-05 22:50:08 Fine, but I doubt they will pay. Oil is on the way out anyways. Renewables will win the day in the end.
7304 2018-01-05 22:50:05 Do you know what vegetable oil does to the environment?
7305 2018-01-05 22:50:03 Yea last year 2017
7306 2018-01-05 22:50:02 He wants to keep the leaks ongoing w/Nunez to erase the fact that Trump was assigned as POTUS by Russians to release American land to the highest paid oil drill bit. PUTIN DESIGNED PLAN WORKS! It is HIS plan to pay back Republican/Russian campaign funds.#Tax #YOUcanBUILDaWALLonIT

7310 2018-01-05 22:49:35 Hey dotard you cant fool anyone but your dwindeling base - installing federal pot prohibition and oil drilling on any shore have arisen only as retribution.  I cant stand that such a creep is in the WH.  I also hear GOP wants Sessions to resign so  can get close to fire Mueller
7311 2018-01-05 22:49:33 Fish oil tablets are so fucking intimidating

7315 2018-01-05 22:49:16 Yeah, I wish that worked. I've lived thru it, and it is far messier than just oil.

7323 2018-01-05 22:48:56 When I see the recent raid from haters against ddlg here I understand that, Americans will never be open-minded it's sad but they will get lost in their oil and racism as the rest of the world opens up and advances... 
7324 2018-01-05 22:48:48 Rub some dirt on it, have a shot of castrol oil and walk it off.

7340 2018-01-05 22:47:28 Yep. Now if we only didn't have that limited access to market issue causing a huge gap between WCS and WTI oil prices. @SPhillipsAB & @davideggenAB earlier protests paying negative dividends now unfortunately for Alberta.
7341 2018-01-05 22:47:27 CBD oil has helped my son's anxiety so much!  It can be life changing.
7342 2018-01-05 22:47:25 Rex was paid in full with oil. The entire admin is corrupt as is the doj and congress. All working for the good of themselves at the expense of the ppl and the nation. They must be stopped before it's too late...while we still outnumber them.
7343 2018-01-05 22:47:14 Idk why but I’m starting to get annoyed at the ig makeup videos where they let the moisturizer/oil drip down their face before applying the foundation
7344 2018-01-05 22:47:01 There is zero chance you get re-elected.  Attack the Oil and Gas industries, attack farmers, attack small buisness, run egregious deficits, and tax-tax-tax.  #oneanddone
7345 2018-01-05 22:46:58 2016: still crude oil at sampling sites from Deepwater Horizon BP disaster. Except for Neritinia. A. Berke #SICB2018
7346 2018-01-05 22:46:57 And the lack of investment reported was a lack of investment *in* the oil companies, not a lack of investment *by* the oil companies in various areas of expenditure.
7347 2018-01-05 22:46:53 It's like oil. They have their own reserve stocks in case Tigers run out elsewhere.
7348 2018-01-05 22:46:38 told my gf i could have just changed her oil, she looked at me crazy like "you know how to do that" 

I WAS LIKE UMMM WHAT NIGGA DONT 
7349 2018-01-05 22:46:34 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
7350 2018-01-05 22:46:32 "Supply and demand" is ancient, because the oil company's manipulate supply in order to drive costs up. They needed to be punished. American greed. Even OPEC would like us to join them. Only a thieving fool would not understand that.
7351 2018-01-05 22:46:25 It provides more than half our energy along with coal and other natural gases, but yeah id rather sneeze cocaine. We gotta look for realistic, helpful and reliable ways to deal with this problem and fining per barrel of oil and not holding bad companies responsible wasnt it
7352 2018-01-05 22:46:22 Protip: get him to use the rosehip oil as a post-shave moisturizer, that’s what really sealed the deal for me.
7353 2018-01-05 22:46:12 At least those establishment boots didn't Trump oil all over them. Chuckle. This triangle will be so much fun. Hey Payola @FredPiccoloJr what's @richardcorcoran got to say about all this @RonDeSantisFL @adamputnam swamp-cleanin' and boot-lickin'. Gotta have something, right?
7354 2018-01-05 22:46:10 The graph was documented by HMRC using the taxation returns from the oil companies. If you want a breakdown of expenditure ask them—ask Bob Dudley as you seem to think he speaks for the whole industry?
7355 2018-01-05 22:46:08 Read am again
7356 2018-01-05 22:46:07 Good luck with the new ferry, the oil rigs I worked on that were made in China were terrible, fake equipment, poor quality workmanship lots of running repairs were needed,maybe that was a bad ship yard though
7357 2018-01-05 22:46:04 i just chug like 4 litres of water every day and cry because it isnt fixing my genuine skin conditions

in all seriousness tho i've heard cod liver oil tablets are great because of the vitamin d
7358 2018-01-05 22:45:46 Combine 4 tsps cauliflower with 11 lbs chips. Add Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve
7359 2018-01-05 22:45:41 I guess Trump would rather have an oil rig overlooking Mir A Lago than wind or solar!
7360 2018-01-05 22:45:24 Yes, not being dependent on oil and worrying about the environment is crazy talk. Thank God for California.
7361 2018-01-05 22:45:23 By my job at Oil States. Ugh!!
7362 2018-01-05 22:45:22 Karyane Ba abunda aka Fara biyan dalibai ,anche dai an ware,amma bai iso hannun dalibai Ba,akache ana suna a gidansu kare,yache mugani a qasa tukun.
7363 2018-01-05 22:45:13 Yes on all of the above. Also the Rosehip Oil is excellent for localised immediate treatment of particularly dry patches of skin.
7364 2018-01-05 22:45:01 Lol your boy Johnny blocked me.  Congrats on Mandel dropping out.  Another failed MAGA candidate.
7365 2018-01-05 22:44:57 You never change my oil
7366 2018-01-05 22:44:52 Why is it our job to support other countries when we got poor and homeless right here ?? How much do out her countries pay ?? What's wrong with the oil rich countries ??
7367 2018-01-05 22:44:42 @NourishUSDA looove the replenishing Argan oil! I use it on my skin and it feels so light and soft.
7368 2018-01-05 22:44:32 At least Hillary Clinton didn't use foundation money to purchase a life size oil painting of herself.
7369 2018-01-05 22:44:31 It was imperative that these two demanded more tax breaks for the 1% of America's wealthiest capitalist robber/oil barons.
7370 2018-01-05 22:44:29 Scorching hot shower and then drowning myself in coconut oil , yumm
7371 2018-01-05 22:44:25 need to cop some vitamin e oil for my skin. heard it does wonders
7372 2018-01-05 22:44:25 Brah, I hope you're not like other metal workers I met because it's unlikely to find them sober. Knife to the gunfight, brah.
7373 2018-01-05 22:44:24 It's an essential oil 
7374 2018-01-05 22:44:21 Got a free oil change since bitches wanted to play today!
7375 2018-01-05 22:44:17 this plays to his base while doing almost nothing. offshore isn’t cheap and oil prices are low. eco-friends have little to fear
7376 2018-01-05 22:44:14 CBD
Oil
Edibles 
Ect ect ect ect
It's 2017
Come with a better anti pot message than the smell.
7377 2018-01-05 22:44:11 Thanks for sharing the specifics Jesse, this is exactly why we need more nuclear capacity on the Mass and New England. 

We can't get enough reliable electricity from Non-Hydro/Biomass renewables alone. This recent event also proves that we are still far to reliant on oil backup.
7378 2018-01-05 22:44:11 Usually once every 2 weeks, just with baby wash and coconut oil! Any more than that and it actually makes him get dirty faster (because the skin makes more oil to compensate)
7379 2018-01-05 22:44:02 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
7380 2018-01-05 22:43:59 If you say so buddy
7381 2018-01-05 22:43:56 Either drill for oil off your coast, or stop using fossil fuels.  How about that?
7382 2018-01-05 22:43:45 SORRY i'm apparently driving you "NUTS" by posting the "time to oil up" sticker dozens of times. sorry that's apparently too much for you to HANDLE. ugh.
7383 2018-01-05 22:43:40 @LarsLarsonShow btw, I’m not saying I’m glad oil production increased, but you can thank Obama for that.
7384 2018-01-05 22:43:38 Yup the whole middle east mess has to do with oil and colonialism and imperialism.But if it were not for oil where would we be know?
7385 2018-01-05 22:43:31 Don't use table salt, hydrogen peroxide or alcohol. If you start to get a scar/bump (like i did) use tea tree oil. 
Spencers & hot topic sell H2Ocean for like $10 and you just spray it on for a couple months and its really easy!
7386 2018-01-05 22:43:29 Damn! someone must have stolen his bottle of Wildroot cream oil tonic!
7387 2018-01-05 22:43:25 You should've went more natural with coconut oil
7388 2018-01-05 22:43:22 Hydraulic oil to the rescue!!
7389 2018-01-05 22:43:16 How can an essential and imported commodity be subjected to deregulation?

Deregulation may eventually be on the plate when we drill oil in Naira, refine in Naira and sell in Naira.

As long as the Dollar remain a factor in the downstream sector , deregulation is a no go area.
7390 2018-01-05 22:43:04 Now you’re talking about ownership group and how they leveraged debt to buy the club. Clearly changing the topic. We are talking about the difference between clever business (whether I like it or not) vs just dumping your family oil money into a club. Explain all the empty seats
7391 2018-01-05 22:43:04 You got scared easy! Fits. Perhaps you can buy a couple of cyber maids. I wonder who will run your country when the oil runs out since you are run by foreigners. Hot, female robots with Saudi passports? Anyhow, I'll let you enjoy Bali, 'troubled' rich little Saudi man!
7392 2018-01-05 22:42:52 Shouldn’t have signed that contract, boot.    my dad had to clean out greasy disgusting material mixed with JP5, oil, dead animals, etc in the tarmac sewers when he was in the Air Force.  So thank your blessings you’re not doing that.
7393 2018-01-05 22:42:47 Oil change and stuff tomorrow.. I need new windshield wipers as well
7394 2018-01-05 22:42:45 @LarsLarsonShow and oil production increased under @BarackObama - the best president of our lifetime. 45 is the nitwit, and everyone knows it, and do does his inner circle.
7395 2018-01-05 22:42:26 Coconut oil is high in lauric acid and a naturally antiviral, antibacterial & antifungal food. Add 1-2 Tbsp. to your daily Green Smoothie!
7396 2018-01-05 22:42:21 I commented some similar about essentials oil some time ago. Does it mean I shouldnt sleep at night either? Or does it mean none of you should call it your own? I'm confused 
7397 2018-01-05 22:42:18 damn ah ninja jus had ah oil spill

7403 2018-01-05 22:41:43 Shell didn't pull out, they sold cause they made a mint. Other companies can get the oil out of the ground cheaper than Shell can so they couldn't compete.
7404 2018-01-05 22:41:38 Glycolic acid toner and rosehip oil!

7408 2018-01-05 22:41:11 I nailed the dot-com like Mary Lou Retton, was too early on the mortgage crisis (like a teenager having sex), and completely missed the oil collapse.
7409 2018-01-05 22:41:10 My first piece of advice...no scale. You don't need it. Cut out processed foods, low fat foods, juices, soda and sweet treats. Change margarine to butter & cook in it, coconut oil, olive oil or ghee only. Think real food, low carbs, and good fats. You'll do great!!
7410 2018-01-05 22:41:03 Coconut oil is hands down the best moisturizer this season
7411 2018-01-05 22:41:02 New job started, no more oil and gas for me. Gone down the geotechnical route.
7412 2018-01-05 22:40:34 "A future of clean, free power is credibly visible for the first time"  I disagree strongly with your assertion.  Discovering oil was akin to winning the lotto for humanity.  No transformation of consciousness will put any more oil in the ground.  There is no substitute for oil.

7426 2018-01-05 22:39:35 I know, right? See how helpful it is when you announce it up front?
7427 2018-01-05 22:39:32 Gov. @JayInslee: "Their knee jerk response is to attack the West coast on oil," on the President and the White House. #MTPDaily
7428 2018-01-05 22:39:28 Gulf states have oil and not much sense. Despite their wealth they still govern like idiots. Open democracy and natural selection will hopefully bring improvements.
7429 2018-01-05 22:39:01 Hope you have your next career path figured out...something in the oil business perhaps
7430 2018-01-05 22:38:58 Mr President I am against off shore drilling we don’t need to do this we are swimming in oil already protect our environment forget these greed oil companies just like the greedy Airlines that don’t tell the many benefits they took away from their employees

Beef is VERY environmentally inefficient. Enviro Min points it out. OUTRAGE!!!
If we had a cigarette industry, should Min of Health not suggest quitting smoking?
Should we all be more inefficient in our use of oil & gas?
Stop it people. Politics is making you stupid.
7432 2018-01-05 22:38:45 1/2 I read the very abridged version of the Pentagon Papers in '79, & found out that E. Landsdale's gang were busy little bees in North Vietnam years before the overt invasion.  They poured Karo Syrup in NVA vehicles' oil filler holes, and they *still* lost the war.

7442 2018-01-05 22:37:02 Not to drill for oil or anything like that. Just to put up a yuuuuge picture of President Obama.
7443 2018-01-05 22:36:58 The market is against him. The price of oil is too low for major projects like that to be economical. For a “business man” Trump doesn’t seem to understand market forces.
7444 2018-01-05 22:36:47 What is going on with Russia sanctions? They are helping now North Korea with ICBM technology and delivering oil against the NK sanctions.
7445 2018-01-05 22:36:40 Yup! Went is for a oil change and found out I needed a new Axle, 4 new tires and my transmission needs to be fixed.

7448 2018-01-05 22:36:10 It's a cyclical move for Canada to add more rigs at this time of year. However, Canadian firms' aggresive move is surprising as the spreads between WTI and both WCS and Canadian Light Crude have been widening due to bottlenecks limit transportation of Canadian oil to the Gulf.

7453 2018-01-05 22:35:10 Instead of us cleaning up, oil companies should pay for all cleanups. The 9 cents was probably not enough.

7458 2018-01-05 22:34:38 You are comparing a parliament with all the powers of a country with the shortbread senate....with less power than a german lander. Funnily enough the folk you shafted during an oil boom are the one's that saved your UK. They wont save your UK the next time.
7459 2018-01-05 22:34:35 Stupid argument.
If we had a cigarette industry should she encourage people to smoke?
Should we promote inefficient use of oil & gas so we use more?
Beef is environmentally unfriendly. Enviro Min points it out.

7468 2018-01-05 22:33:52 I use olive oil for cooking meat and dressing salads, coconut oil for veges, ghee for eggs, beef and lamb dripping for roasting.
Will use a splash of sesame oil on stir fry (the dose makes the poison).
7469 2018-01-05 22:33:48 GOP is just plain disgusting! Oil spills are guaranteed...They happen at sea, they happen on land. No regulations, no savings for spills=.

7484 2018-01-05 22:32:05 Here in Oregon, we already know how to pump gas... we simply prefer not to do so.

Congrats on that, but I think we'll just stay cooler than the rest of you.

7501 2018-01-05 22:30:03 I use an oil mix of Coconut/Castor/Almond/Vitamin E on my hair abt 3 times a week but the ACV co wash works really well bc my hair literally holds on to everything so it gives me a really good cleanse and leaves my hair soft. But it’s all about trial and error w/ natural hair.
7502 2018-01-05 22:29:43 What’s more effective than petitions is reducing demand. Make LA safe for cycling and we’ll reduce our oil consumption so much any investor with half a brain won’t put their $$$ in new oil projects.
7503 2018-01-05 22:29:42 Oh, I'm SURE that's what you were going for, LOL!
If that is, indeed, the case, you're the most faggoty person in this thread, by far.

7507 2018-01-05 22:29:09 @LauraAJarrett Republicans in DOJ and FBI are investigating Clinton Foundation for pay for play.

7511 2018-01-05 22:28:44 Reminds me of when I ask people what oil is doing and they say "it's up 1%". Means nothing to me. Oil would be up 50 cents whether the basis was 30 or 100.
7512 2018-01-05 22:28:41 Need someone to rub oil through my scalp 
7513 2018-01-05 22:28:37 Close - but mine were fried in oil with Italian seasonings.

7518 2018-01-05 22:27:38 Investing in youth is the United way and should always be our way. Big money buys help buy the youngsters coming through the system give me a belief in the game despite the oil money staining it @FullTimeDEVILS @rioferdy5 @Adam_207 @TotallyMUFC

7526 2018-01-05 22:26:50 Wrong. Just shut up; you have no idea of what you’re talking about. I guess your against nuclear energy as well? Reduce your energy consumption yourself... I want gas, heat, oil, plastic, fertilizer, transportation, and electricity. Your money is in “clean” energy...greedy jerk.
7527 2018-01-05 22:26:40 Mom jokes are timeless buddy
7528 2018-01-05 22:26:40 Putin has nothing to sell except oil and gas. Therefore Trump likes oil and gas. Rexxon waits in the background to do a production partnership with Russia. It’s always the money.
7529 2018-01-05 22:26:37 Hahahaha!! 'reasons of dignity'. Journalists that took GPS payments & the term dignity are like water &amp; oil.

7541 2018-01-05 22:24:12 I did this at my parents' house: Apply oil. Q-tips would be good. I used my fingers. I held the mouse by the nape of the neck and very gently applied oil, scrape under the mouse, apply oil, etc, until you've got the mouse off. Be really careful with their feet though.

7548 2018-01-05 22:23:34 Grandma died? Eat better and get some coconut oil.
7549 2018-01-05 22:23:27 They should never be on our dime they have all the oil let them feed their selves
7550 2018-01-05 22:23:25 Ever since the phony Shah was toppled, the CIA can't control Iranian oil output.
7551 2018-01-05 22:23:22 Coconut oil in a glass jar. Lovely. And well done. Am massively impressed. Have you tried @GreenWomanStore handmade deo in a glass jar? Gorgeous stuff! X

7553 2018-01-05 22:23:20 #OPEC  should drastically reduce oil output to bring back normal prices!
7554 2018-01-05 22:23:20 Idc if you been through a terrible break up. Eat better and get some coconut oil.
7555 2018-01-05 22:23:13 .@marcorubio But you were cool with oil drilling in the wildlife refuge in Alaska?
7556 2018-01-05 22:22:52 SHER WHYYYYY but seriously he better fucking not I will incase him in coconut oil so fast
7557 2018-01-05 22:22:49 The only advice I’m giving people this year is to eat better and get some coconut oil.

7560 2018-01-05 22:22:37 Many newer lower paying jobs.  Lets help out our oil and gas companies too.  The business owners on the core of Calgary getting hammered by higher taxes, min wage hikes... not a good look.
7561 2018-01-05 22:22:35 GOP got their tax cuts for their Robber Barons Trump is opening up pristine land for mining and oil drilling He's appointing incompetent rtwing stooges as federal judges for life In other words he's good for THEM and their DONOR CLASS They've got three more years to pillage USA
7562 2018-01-05 22:22:32 Mine would be the first one to refuse to drive until all stock race cars pivot to renewable energy sources. This sport is a joke. We send troops to die for oil and we honor them by burning thousands of gallons in a few short hours for ancient Roman mob style pleasure. #Nope
7563 2018-01-05 22:22:12 wasn't about regime change it was about getting them out of Kuwait that's why the allies didn't pursue, it was about 1/3 rd of world's oil supply , just cause you don't like it  dont make it illegal
7564 2018-01-05 22:22:04 Japan tocaron canciones de Quiet Life y European Son en sus últimos conciertos y no las grabaron para Oil on Canvas. >:(
7565 2018-01-05 22:21:58 Fuck that. Insteadof that sad mess, shred them into a bowl, add a tablespoon of olive oil, tablespoon of lemon juice, and mix in some craisins.
7566 2018-01-05 22:21:56 Lol
7567 2018-01-05 22:21:56 He intends to have a government owned oil company, like Putin and his government. That’s how their gov. Officials have accumulated vast personal wealth.   I can see the $$$ sign in the GOP and Pres. eyes. Remember Exxon/Mobile paid for drilling rights in  Russia also.
7568 2018-01-05 22:21:55 It's freezing, so naturally I have the oil on. However, every time I put the oil on I get a terrible headache. Which I had forgotten, until of course I got a terrible headache because the oil is on :(

Nothing xenophobic being concerned re Russian aggression & nuclear capability, their support of Assad, their funding of terrorism in Iran, their shipping oil to NK. Putin is a murderous Kleptocrat w high ambitions

Ryan Zinke - "Sweeet."
7582 2018-01-05 22:20:13 I just love it. But it really is easy-- it only takes about 2 hours from beginning to end. Try either the Lydia Bastianich or the King Arthur Flour recipes. And double the olive oil.
7583 2018-01-05 22:20:02 Just another attack from the NDP. First was oil and gas industry the totally killed the Coal industry now an attack on farmers Shannon do you forget where most of the government Revinue comes from? Money does not come from rainbows and unicorns!
7584 2018-01-05 22:20:01 I can wait for that first derrick of the Florida coast drilling for oil,  considering that Trump won the state,  and this is what the " white working class"  wanted..
7585 2018-01-05 22:19:55 But the OIL, Boss, the OIL.
7586 2018-01-05 22:19:54 The two days out of the week that I wear it out I have it covered with a hood if I'm outside and always make sure it's coated with oil
7587 2018-01-05 22:19:42 No. It’s fucked because the current Scottish Government has failed to secure any significant outside investment to our economy in the last 11 YEARS.... except Trumps golf course! The oil industry has also fell on its arse and they’ve done little to revitalise it.

7596 2018-01-05 22:18:28 I don't speak for everyone but I am protesting, unfair tax cuts for the rich, decimating our natural resources for oil which is not progressive, its old school, non belief in science and climate change and lifting of hazardous pollution restrictions.
7597 2018-01-05 22:18:14 When it mossy pumice-stones in oil.
7598 2018-01-05 22:18:13 I already use argan!! But I have been curious about rosehip oil!
7599 2018-01-05 22:18:07 Guesstimate from the hip. Its not actual oil leaking. Perspiration ting.

7601 2018-01-05 22:18:03 wtf this is a set up. My oil change light popped on while I’m at the Oil Change place just tryna get some air. Wow may as well get one they’re about to tell me I need blah blah n blah
7602 2018-01-05 22:18:03 Seeing the paintings in person, the brush strokes, the little bits of brush trapped in the oil paint... There is nothing like that. Nothing.
7603 2018-01-05 22:18:02 @GeorginaStevens couldn’t you use an olive oil on it? I’ve negotiated non plastic cotton buds, toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush, moisturiser, lip balm, face scrub, bees wrap, body wash, soap & razor - now totally stumped on conditioner

Thank you so very much! Will come again!
7608 2018-01-05 22:17:02 Does it need to be foaming? The DHC oil cleanser is a joy for me, and the milky jelly gel cleanser from Glossier is a recent success too. There's a gel cleanser Boots do as part of their beautiful skin range that was decent too.
7609 2018-01-05 22:17:00 Oops. I have been discussing the local grid, and the trouble it is in. $400 plus per MWh, oil used for more than 30% of the power etc.  I was discussing the importance of storing fuel for generators.  I wasn’t discussing NOPR.  Over and out of this discussion.
7610 2018-01-05 22:17:00 Okay there is this very very fine man gettting an oil change while I am and we’re sitting next to each other I think he wants to date??
7611 2018-01-05 22:16:55 Well duh! We have so much of our own oil that we basically left alone and used everyone else's.

7619 2018-01-05 22:16:00 FYI, different item:

Oil companies where required to pay 9 cents per every barrel of oil produced to fund emergency spill cleanup.  Thanks to GOP tax bill, as of January 1, oil companies pay 0 into the fund.
7620 2018-01-05 22:16:00 Yep, I don’t usually get stains from morphe but Bahi shadows are a bitch to remove. Oil based cleanser or mieceller water for the win
7621 2018-01-05 22:15:57 Thank you beautiful  I put witch hazel on my face every day and I add a mixture of tea tree oil & water if I’m breaking out to dry up the acne. I also use Mario Badescu’s rosewater face spray as a toner & then all I drink is water!

7630 2018-01-05 22:14:54 Is tea tree oil and witch hazel good for your hair?

7637 2018-01-05 22:13:54 That’s actually good to know, b/c the #oilers does the same thing, I.e., leave the goalie out to dry. I’m sensing a lot of parallels btwn the Habs & Oil. Including quality of GM ;) (pls don’t take LB when hits waivers).

7639 2018-01-05 22:13:29 The maturation process is done by the time the oil migrates out of the source rock. It finds its way into reservoirs that are shallower & have lower pressure and temperature. Over-pressured reservoirs result from overlying sealing beds that hold all the gas in the oil.

7650 2018-01-05 22:12:48 This was a first for me

Rode today in a Mercedes E Class diesel whose driver operates it (almost) solely on ...

7654 2018-01-05 22:12:20 FYI... ATF is not a correct lubricant. Use a proper Gun Oil. Go to a gun dealer, Walmart, Dicks etc.. You’ll be rewarded in overall performance. (I’m in the oil biz.)

7660 2018-01-05 22:11:50 So open cut coal mines are easier on the eyes?

Either way energy production needs land and infrastructure, but solar and wind looks far neater than oil rigs, refineries, coal mines, coal trains and coal power plants...
7661 2018-01-05 22:11:40 The Oilers will have about the same faith in AM as they had in LB.  Neither will play more than 4 games so again why make this trade if AM is not your long term backup. What’s his contract status?
7662 2018-01-05 22:11:40 We avoid oil issue by not talking replacement for oil or expansion of synthetic oil.
7663 2018-01-05 22:11:35 I need some mini spray bottles for my essential oil combinations I’ve made.
7664 2018-01-05 22:11:31 No thanks.

7666 2018-01-05 22:11:13 These two ex-Square designers want to replace real estate offices with oil consumption
7667 2018-01-05 22:11:12 Make sure they come from the oil rigs!
7668 2018-01-05 22:11:10 You do realize that we get most of our oil from places OTHER than the Middle East, right? It's an easily researched fact. But that would go against your myopic view.
7669 2018-01-05 22:11:08 I can say, first hand, this is a bad idea.
7670 2018-01-05 22:11:06 Oiler fan here.  I wonder if Maroon would be on his radar, and if so, what would look good going back to the Oil?
7671 2018-01-05 22:11:00 Chili oil for tonight's snow even though I pl...
7672 2018-01-05 22:10:44 Ohh lol. That it was like skin oil.
7673 2018-01-05 22:10:39 Yes. Should be ok - how overfilled did it go? Watch your heat gauge to make sure you’re ok. Any Rapid Oil / Jiffy Lube Type place could check pressure too
7674 2018-01-05 22:10:32 He was very very good. No van dijk though if Couthino wasn’t sold. Ye don’t have a massive oil sugar daddy. Couldn’t go on with that defence either though. Would you have persisted? Big call but could get ye top 4 and win FA cup if all stay fit
7675 2018-01-05 22:10:22 I generally make a Flax Oil Dressing which is my favourite!  4 TBLSP Flax Oil, 2 TBSP Apple Cider Vinegar, 1 TBSP Maple Syrup, 1 TBSP Peanut Butter and some hot mustard.  It is my go-to dressing!

7677 2018-01-05 22:10:10 RT @LivingSafely: Cool #Whip this January? Its first three #ingredients are water, hydrogenated oil and High Fructose Corn Syrup!
7678 2018-01-05 22:10:00 Crap! My state has a republican gov who doesnt care about healthcare, just donors, kochs, mercers, traveling the state like a snake oil salesman selling lies.
Doomed I guess.
7679 2018-01-05 22:09:49 China is world's largest importer of oil. Russia has oil. China has gold. Nations under US sanctions can't get USD 2 buy oil. US petro $ backed by nothing except debt. US relies on petro $ 2 borrow at low rates. Gold-backed rubles,yuan much more appealing.
7680 2018-01-05 22:09:48 i eat a predominately vegan diet but eat fish in addition since i feel too worn out otherwise---ill check out that tens machine, i'm not familiar with it. as for weed, i don't like the psychoactive effects when i'm doing day-to-day stuff and cbd oil wasn't a huge help. thank you!
7681 2018-01-05 22:09:34 Puerto Rico - Ruined by a hurricaine, still recovering
Equatorial Guinea - Fucked by oil prices, in 3rd world and with authoritarian govt.
North Korea - Also communist. Cannot feed it's own people
Brunei - Also fucked by oil prices and absolutely tiny
Great job beating all those
7682 2018-01-05 22:09:21 Sitting here wondering why i legit scheduled a Saturday 7am oil change and maintenance for my car tomorrow.. wtf wrong with me lol
7683 2018-01-05 22:08:42 @MCFCTone  mate your clubs built on blood money and oil. LFC built on values of football. Your well triggered
7684 2018-01-05 22:08:34 Yes that's not the point at all. U need to read up on what's going on. Coal has nothing 2 do w anything. It's Russia & Chinas threat 2 the US petro $. Most nations buying oil must have USD. Russia,China want that to end. It's economic. As I said read up on Bretton woods.
7685 2018-01-05 22:08:33 week 1/4 without wearing any makeup: almost all of the texture on my skin is gone & acne scarring is disappearing more every day! using cetaphil daily cleanser & tea tree cleanser topped with a tea tree oil where needed
7686 2018-01-05 22:08:23 gotta get new brakes & some engine work done after spending $250 on an oil change & new battery last week. 3yrs of spending all ur money on a car that u have 0 desire to drive is exhausting. think it’s time to sell & move on to something more dutiable for my lifestyle.
7687 2018-01-05 22:08:11 If a pipeline was running through your backyard, you'd sing a different tune.  Amusing to see how you're indifferent to the plight of other Americans.  There's already been a oil spill...but of course that doesn't matter to you.  Last I checked, the POTUS and Kim Jon Un were...
7688 2018-01-05 22:08:00 destroy the oil industry
7689 2018-01-05 22:07:54 Coconut oil saves lives
7690 2018-01-05 22:07:44 Hours in the gym... injecting synth oil.
7691 2018-01-05 22:07:44 Only you made that out...

The thread regarded oil price...shale did not affect it until 2014
7692 2018-01-05 22:07:43 i mean there is virgin oil
7693 2018-01-05 22:07:32 @realDonaldTrump 2017 was the largest oil production in America's history. What good is more oil exploration if we are still paying high fuel prices.  We should be paying the lowest right now! If you really want the economy rolling tell the greedy oil companies to lower prices.
7694 2018-01-05 22:07:29 If your car still has a Rudolph nose on it, then I'm willing to wager you need an oil change and tire rotation too.
7695 2018-01-05 22:07:24 started taking fish oil pills and now i have gills on my neck
7696 2018-01-05 22:06:55 That sucks. Also give that truck some new oil
7697 2018-01-05 22:06:55 I'm a woman, and you're just a dolt.
7698 2018-01-05 22:06:52 Problem with castor oil, besides the fact that it's an oil, has to be the non-stop burping. Why kante?
7699 2018-01-05 22:06:40 Ur on point now aren't ya Snake oil salesman.  U like at every turn.  It's coming,. U r not a Teflon don
7700 2018-01-05 22:06:32 yeah personally i don't like the psychoactive effects and cbd oil didn't do much for me. do the patches impair daily function in any way? they're a type of opioid right?
7701 2018-01-05 22:06:15 You got any diffusers with the oil included?
7702 2018-01-05 22:06:06 Bravo, Russia!! FERGUSON's SAVAGERY is as "American, as apple pie", isn't it? NOTHING is ever said when there is MISBEHAVIOR by some since they have RACE CARD EXEMPTION. They also don't have POPPY-FIELDS, or OIL! US only goes-after those who pose GENUINE threat!
7703 2018-01-05 22:06:05 my last quoted tweet i cant breathe i keep imagining jimin slipping on the oil and smashing the stove dkdkck
7704 2018-01-05 22:06:03 I’m tryna be in Cali this summer smelling like coconut body oil and my skin warmed and tan by the sun
7705 2018-01-05 22:06:02 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
7706 2018-01-05 22:06:01 Forgot oil for more chickens 
7707 2018-01-05 22:05:41 I just witnessed the most intense musical chairs, limbo and arm wrestling of my life and got duped into taking a shot of fish oil. Iceland is WILD and also beer costs $14 and I will never be ok with that
7708 2018-01-05 22:05:34 My kink? Slathering myself in coconut oil and vitamin E. This is the year of MOISTURIZING bitch
7709 2018-01-05 22:05:29 Moroccan oil hand cream smells like heaven
7710 2018-01-05 22:05:27 Good read!  I agree dreger announcement was a dick move from a guy that ,well is a dick.
7711 2018-01-05 22:05:27 When the blue raspberry oil stains your retinas
7712 2018-01-05 22:05:18 Norway was poorer than Scotland when oil was found in both countries waters. Your party kept folk poor on purpose for votes in Westminster and denied hundreds of thousands of central belt scots the chance to have norway levels of prosperity. Utterly shameful in my opinion.
7713 2018-01-05 22:05:11 just watched a vid of olive oil being produced and it was really nice and satisfying and im almost not in a state of total despair anymore
7714 2018-01-05 22:04:59 top it off with some butter or coconut oil and i'm sure its good to go right?

7718 2018-01-05 22:04:24 Hi I know you’re just reading my tweet but it’s be really great if you could buy me an essential oil diffuser that would be great.     Thaaaaaaaanks 
7719 2018-01-05 22:04:16 I pressed 3 garlic cloves into the olive oil so my kitchen smells absolutely amazing, but the focaccia has barely browned in the half hour since I put it in the oven
7720 2018-01-05 22:04:13 Keep going. Energy doesn’t stop with oil. Job creation however will stop without forward thinking. Jobs in oil and renewable energy can coexist and benefit us all. Keep going.
7721 2018-01-05 22:04:10 Joe, he's under the delusion that we are liberals, LOL!
7722 2018-01-05 22:04:06 I don’t like adulting to spend money on things I need  oil change, phone bill, gas 
7723 2018-01-05 22:04:00 How come there's not "Extra Slutty Olive Oil"?
7724 2018-01-05 22:03:55 #HeyTony @egoldie80 @TonyGrossi People say and I agree that J Gruden & D Carr are like water & Oil.  If you're the Browns, would you trade the #1 pick for D Carr?  #JohnMarshallLawyers
7725 2018-01-05 22:03:50 Lmao man I’m fr that clear glowing skin does it for me! But yesssss, it can be kind of drying that’s why i use the coconut oil afterwards

7729 2018-01-05 22:03:20 who's got me on a $25 oil change without stealing my airbags?

7732 2018-01-05 22:03:15 Yes mam! No longer than 10 minutes probably less. Oh and drizzle olive oil too before they go in.
7733 2018-01-05 22:03:09 SO easy and really tasty. I used coconut oil because mine was solid, rather than butter or oil to grease the glass baking pan. The big pizza cutter was the easiest way to cut them. I greased that, too.
7734 2018-01-05 22:02:56 i then proceeded to oil my scalp with this cocoa butter/ shea butter concoction i got in hawaii lol i smell like shea butter and strong natural bug spray
7735 2018-01-05 22:02:55 So the high pressure crude oil is subjected to in a tight reservoir rock like shale prevents many short chain molecules from cracking thereby creating lower energy content oil?
7736 2018-01-05 22:02:40 @DonaldTrump States like Florida, Texas, Louisiana have been given taxpayer money in huge amounts to cover hurricane damage over the last ten years. Offshore development of oil and natural gas will help recoup those amounts of money. A must do for America energy dominance.
7737 2018-01-05 22:02:37 Looking for recommendations for heating oil just got cancelled by my company for a delivery on Tuesday and about to run out!!??#itscold
@PerkasieBorough
7738 2018-01-05 22:02:29 It would raise the cost of mining if Oil was at $90 but as to the cost.  The correlation is positive when the equities fall, people will be running to safer places like gold, silver, oil, AG.
7739 2018-01-05 22:02:21 Not only 2 expand Offshore Drilling of Oil, but, sell WE THE PEOPLE's Land, now, mis-managed by the BLM, & pay off the National Debt! But, the sales must B @ arms length & NO INSIDER TRADING! #MAGA w/Donald Trump!
7740 2018-01-05 22:02:18 Listen closely to the words the Dem talking heads use. Listen more closely to the words they refuse to use. Within the subtle difference in meaning, often lies the truth. Snake Oil Salesman. Nothing more.
7741 2018-01-05 22:02:17 Ibrahim, may God bless you and your family! Ordinary Americans don't want our government starting & sustaining all these wars & weapons flooding into the Middle East. Our government is basically owned by weapon makers, banks & oil companies.
7742 2018-01-05 22:02:13 "Who said somethin bout oil, bitch you cookin?" 
7743 2018-01-05 22:02:11 cbd is snake oil
7744 2018-01-05 22:02:07 One of my many new years resolutions was to take better care of my skin, so I bought a bunch of stuff from Ulta, and it finally arrived!  I'm most excited to use this makeup remover oil.
7745 2018-01-05 22:01:59 The place I get Chan’s hair oil from just put out a new leave in conditioner for $15! Time to say bye to that $32 jar of baby buttercreme 
7746 2018-01-05 22:01:58 Cbd oil?
7747 2018-01-05 22:01:53 thought it was a good idea to do a hot oil treatment with castor oil and pure tea tree oil
7748 2018-01-05 22:01:47 Co-optation, astroturf, Gas and Oil lobbyists? Who funds you?
Does Ellis have offshore numbered accounts in LNG? Gerrymandered riding made for you? Did you get one of those free 5 Star trips to Asia? #Kitimat #bcpoli
7749 2018-01-05 22:01:43 I rub her down in oil
7750 2018-01-05 22:01:39 Elites? Like the billionaire Oil Magnates the Koch brothers, not those elites, perhaps you mean Betsy Devos, the billionaire heir to the Amway fortune nope she's in his cabinet....
7751 2018-01-05 22:01:34 Coconut oil
7752 2018-01-05 22:01:31 I thought that article was a bit poorly researched, wastewater in OK is mostly formation fluids ( even conventional wells produce X10 brine to oil) not really much to do with fracking fluids at all.
7753 2018-01-05 22:01:25 Got coconut oil teeth whitening paste in my mouth and am playing charades with ellie trying to explain that we can take drink out in our bags tomorrow 
7754 2018-01-05 22:01:18 Your declaration that there is no revenue from oil, re your first tweet. Anyway, back to work on Monday to talk to more soft no voters,whose standard of living is depreciating every month thanks to the machinations of the glorious UK 
7755 2018-01-05 22:01:12 Hot oil treatment and deep conditioning treatment for the win 
7756 2018-01-05 22:01:05 this one has "tea three oil" in it 
7757 2018-01-05 22:01:01 Get that oil to market....
7758 2018-01-05 22:00:51 I’m about to learn how to change the oil in my car, it’s over for you bitches
7759 2018-01-05 22:00:45 Walking around the flat at a 90 degree angle cuz of the oil drops in my ear
7760 2018-01-05 22:00:42 OIL DIFF: 6.43 -> 6.45
7761 2018-01-05 22:00:34 Thanks and Ewing Oil is a cliffhanger around every corner lol
7762 2018-01-05 22:00:33 Shoutout to the old man who picks me up & takes me shopping when there’s a long wait on an oil change  #PapawtotheRescue
7763 2018-01-05 22:00:24 [1/3] Calgary’s oil and gas companies might be feeling some relief as oil prices have climbed to over $60 in recent days. If prices remain steady or even climb, it might mean an increase in activity for the oilpatch. #oilandgas #oilprice
7764 2018-01-05 22:00:23 Steel stocks were up almost 7% this week (4 trading days).

Oil & Gas Equipment also strong up 6.5%.  

Semis up over 5%.
7765 2018-01-05 22:00:22 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
7766 2018-01-05 22:00:18 How much castor oil were you drinking? 
7767 2018-01-05 22:00:12 January 05, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
7768 2018-01-05 22:00:11 Oregano oil. research it. It’s so gross but I honestly think it burns off whatever is in your system. I also drink the lemon-ginger Kampuchea, raspberry emergen-c with either blue gatorade or lemon seltzer and/or pints of fresh OJ
7769 2018-01-05 22:00:11 funded through an increase in the national debt of close to a trillion dollars. We are experiencing the first catastrophes of an era of climate change and the other main achievement is the scrapping of environmental regulations, and opening up the Arctic to oil exploration.
7770 2018-01-05 22:00:10 Why do think Tillerson said today in his .@CNN interview that he was behind Trump 100% and hiis drilling in our oceans.  #RexTillerson comes from oil companies.
7771 2018-01-05 22:00:00 Chicken: spinach, artichoke heart, sun-dried tomato, garlic and olive oil, Fusilli
7772 2018-01-05 21:59:45 Seaport Agencies count with a professional team with more than 30+years of experience in the agency services, shipping, inspection, and oil transportation. 
Seaport Agencies has become the most reliable & identifiable ship agency service company in Venezuela / the Caribbean ports
7773 2018-01-05 21:59:30 Or .... 'It's cold and snowing so, there can't be any Global 'warming'!'  We have them here too. They usually have shares in big Oil! 
7774 2018-01-05 21:59:28 Norway's decision on Arctic oil drilling blow to environmental groups
7775 2018-01-05 21:59:26 While venturing out in the negative windchills to take my car to have the oil changed, I heard “Heaven South” on the radio for the first time. For a few minutes it made me feel as though it was summer....or at least 50 degrees! @BradPaisley
7776 2018-01-05 21:59:25 People put coconut oil on their face holy cow I could never like I would break out
7777 2018-01-05 21:59:25 I think Oil will go to 65-66 and back off some but see it above $60 for most, if not all of 2018.
7778 2018-01-05 21:59:20 At least now you know cannabis oil treatment is an option. You can thank me later once you treat a loved one with it. But till then stop.
7779 2018-01-05 21:59:10 Coconut oil is suppose to be really good
7780 2018-01-05 21:59:09 Well the squeaky wheel always gets the oil 
7781 2018-01-05 21:59:05 Truffle oil
7782 2018-01-05 21:58:57 Evan is my son and so deserving of this. He is going to be a new dad in 5 weeks. Thank you!!
7783 2018-01-05 21:58:38 But also I have a spray on olive oil leave-in conditioner that is magic
7784 2018-01-05 21:58:35 call on those that Should B helping the churches, and you yes you, why not regulate the health insurance industry as u once did to the oil company's it is not the responsibility of the tax payers to fund health care for the next guy.  hey, God bless Berine, have a gret weekend
7785 2018-01-05 21:58:30 Name something more millennial than organic beard oil. I’ll wait.
7786 2018-01-05 21:58:29 The understanding was that he needed money (hence the oil baron joke he made back then). The owed taxes confirmed money had to be collected. Kimberlie piggybacked this situation as money needing to be owed to her.
7787 2018-01-05 21:58:28 that would’ve been funny af. Just running out with oil 
7788 2018-01-05 21:58:21 2/2
That smell could also be:
2. Obama's legacy going up in smoke.
But Hillary's boxes marked Wedding Correspondence going up in flames is adding to it.  Nothing to see there, move on.  This is how she does her Federal record keeping as the investigation into her crimes reopens.
7789 2018-01-05 21:58:20 Volcanic waste is centralized and confined the the deepest parts of the ocean. There are also natural remedies that eliminate it. There is no such thing for massive oil spills which is why we had to spend $60 billion cleaning it up.
7790 2018-01-05 21:58:17 Never really thought about hoping an entire city gets Ebola...well here’s to hoping .........
7791 2018-01-05 21:58:04 I’ve been at Bayside for two hours for a tire rotation and oil change. The mechanics must be having a circle jerk or something
7792 2018-01-05 21:57:56 So is possession of illegal drugs. Is every person who uses cannabis oil intending to cause harm?
7793 2018-01-05 21:57:44 Was a Skippy Chunky fan as a kid .
Tried all kinda "natural" versions from local nut farms in California , but whenever the oil separated , was kinda nasty when it needed stirred up to even use .
Awesome flavor , but too much work .
I just buy JIF  anymore .
7794 2018-01-05 21:57:44 Ha!  As long as it’s a solar powered oil rig!!!
7795 2018-01-05 21:57:35 No oil and no uranium in Spain
7796 2018-01-05 21:57:32 Well this guy isn't making investments in oil and gas. He's making investments in the companies that make investments in oil and gas with other peoples money. If we're going by who invests in shares in oil & gas? That's pretty much....everyone.
7797 2018-01-05 21:57:23 I got some coconut oil.. come over and rub yourself down.. 
7798 2018-01-05 21:57:17 Coconut oil.. skin, hair, cooking! I love this!! Such an improvement after a week 
7799 2018-01-05 21:57:17 about 6 years ago we went from oil burned forced hot air to a water boiler and radiators in every room.  Unbearably expensive, but we're fucking rich in the winter.  I no longer have 24/7 nosebleeds
7800 2018-01-05 21:57:10 Actually it would be more of an asset so we don’t have to keep buying imported oil!!!  Don’t you just love Trump?!!!  I do!!!
7801 2018-01-05 21:57:05 I just bought these car and oil warmer scents 
7802 2018-01-05 21:56:59 just infused some olive oil with cedarwood branch clippings to make a wearable oil.
7803 2018-01-05 21:56:52 When you have to wait an hour or more for you car’s oil change, and you have to chose between Friday night after work or Saturday afternoon... Friday night it is, Saturday is officially hibernating day!
7804 2018-01-05 21:56:39 You know when your fried eggs in the pan start queefing hot oil all over the place. Ain’t that shit terrifying
7805 2018-01-05 21:56:31 Thousands of good paying jobs depend on the oil sector too. Is it just as offensive to suggest purchasing a fuel efficient vehicle instead of a gas guzzling SUV?

If not, why not?
7806 2018-01-05 21:56:28 Of course not! There's no oil in Catalonia!
7807 2018-01-05 21:56:24 sounds like u better take ur fish oil

7811 2018-01-05 21:56:03 Who wanna give my car an oil change Bc I don’t wanna go to no mechanic & have them overcharge me
7812 2018-01-05 21:55:57 PSA: if you have bad sinus issues (runny/ stopped up nose) use peppermint essential oil, put 1 drop in the middle of your hand and rub your hands together, then smell your hands. Within 2 minutes you will feel better. 
7813 2018-01-05 21:55:53 harsh, guys - I'm just a oil rig worker

7815 2018-01-05 21:55:45 The deal was, if Trump could get the sanctions involving North Sea oil removed, then he would get 19% of the Rosneft deal. Worth many billions!
7816 2018-01-05 21:55:39 it's unbearably expensive, but also life changing.   Get the most expensive one there is. You'll feel rich because you're warm.  What do you burn?  Natural gas?  Heating Oil?  Propane?  Wood?  Pellets?  Homeless People?

7821 2018-01-05 21:55:05 Ah, I see more proposals for offshore development in Alaska. Waters are already vulnerable to toxic algal blooms, the Blob, and overfishing. Now let's disturb the water more by adding noise pollution and most likely oil spills.
7822 2018-01-05 21:54:50 you should find other sources of income for Alaska than dessimating the Land which is for all Americans not just Alaska.Alaska has reaped the benefits of oil why was money not put aside for other revenue generation?. Like all other oil states dividends are no longer sustainable.
7823 2018-01-05 21:54:50 I say legal medical marijuana should include all types of marijuana and not just marijuana oil that is the only legal medical marijuana in Florida
7824 2018-01-05 21:54:49 Super ironic that I just starting doing this, too! Let me know if you have other essential oil tricks!
7825 2018-01-05 21:54:47 Oil and water!
7826 2018-01-05 21:54:43 yes indeed, turning sacred Indian sites into mines and oil fields. I hope you republican senators are proud of your greed
7827 2018-01-05 21:54:41 lol fair enough.
7828 2018-01-05 21:54:37 We used to have oil and gas royalties paying for stuff that we didn't want to. Now, not so much.

7830 2018-01-05 21:54:11 It's like he crawled out of trumps butt after taking BS notes & propagandized for a few minutes hoping he sold his snake oil...this guys a douche & they're all traitors. What a bad idea trump was. If only we had known, if only someone had warned us.

7835 2018-01-05 21:53:50 I am not guessing or trying to heard but I believe the #NPFL can give us more than what our blood sucking crude oil is giving us. Don't get me wrong crude oil is not cursed but the demons running the country since 1960 are. Let's not pass this pain, shame and disgrace to our kids
7836 2018-01-05 21:53:49 So, it's OK to drill for oil and damage the environment elsewhere, just not off the coast of South Carolina? You realize this sounds incredibly hypocritical, right?
7837 2018-01-05 21:53:46 Trump is a terrorist!  First, he lets the oil-spill tax lapse.  Then, he opens oil drilling in the sensitive Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic.   Nothing but a ticking time BOMB.  Do you feel terror?
7838 2018-01-05 21:53:37 As Thomas Friedman said about morsi “ islamists without oil” you can’t keep your thumbing your nose at Uncle Sam and get away with it if you have no oil...
7839 2018-01-05 21:53:35 Actually, the Deepwater Horizon spill DID happen off the SoCal Coast-in 1969, off Santa Barbara. It was the largest oil spill in the US at that time. As a kid growing up in Los Angeles, I'll never forget it. We had tar sticking to our feet on the beach all the way down the coast.

7844 2018-01-05 21:53:09 you should go suggest they pour some cooking oil down the sewer drains (a tip from your old plumber lou neri rip)......
7845 2018-01-05 21:53:06 Yikes!  Try Boom Silk, it's expensive but goes a long long way and works. Honey, olive oil, naturally sourced. No bad stuff in it. It kind of waterproofs your hands and let's them heal. 
Cheaper: Good old hand lotion applied while your hands are wet and then coat with Vaseline.
7846 2018-01-05 21:52:58 @AtlasGlenMor Despite having auto-refill plan, woke up this AN to no oil in tank. Been waiting all day for delivery that was promised today. After finally getting through again, now we’re told that no delivery is scheduled and they don’t know what we’re talking about.  HELP.
7847 2018-01-05 21:52:45 I'm not so sure about that. Houses with solar panels pump energy BACK into the grid. Solar and Wind for example, are exponentially more abundant than Oil or Coal. And are you aware of the chemical extraction processes involved in producing the fuels for nuclear power.
7848 2018-01-05 21:52:40 As petroleum matures with greater heat & pressure, long-chained HC molecules are split or "cracked" into progressively shorter-chained molecules. The simplest and smallest is methane CH4. Natural refining. That's how gas ends up dissolved in oil, like CO2 in Coke before opened.

7899 2018-01-05 21:47:26 Its also not our oil, as the point of the pipeline is carry oil from the tar sands in Canada to the refineries in Texas and then back to Canada.  We profit, but its not our oil.

7911 2018-01-05 21:46:17 Yes, keep self serves out.  There are many self-serve stations available in surrounding municipalities.  As the demographics of the age of customers continues to shift to retirement years this will see older customers wanting others to check the oil, gas up, etc.

7939 2018-01-05 21:43:23 Hi! Random person popping in... But try lavender essential oil. Just put like 14 drops in a carrier oil (almond, coconut, etc) and rub down on that area. Then use heating pad. Lavender Helps muscles relax. Also, walking helps me a lot!

7943 2018-01-05 21:43:06 It's going to end up Pence's boss, the Kochs, want Russian oil. Mercer wanted all voter information. Pence was appointed VP running mate in exchange for Mercer's money. Pence was put in charge of transition to see that Koch and Mercer people were appointed.

7948 2018-01-05 21:42:29 No because Norway didn’t give their resources away to big oil . They kept it a country owned resource making billions of dollars profit for the betterment of their people
7949 2018-01-05 21:42:23 Right? Apparently, they finished the oil change then forgot to come tell me. o_O

7954 2018-01-05 21:41:48 Been waiting for an oil change and inspection for an HOUR. No one else waiting. Guess I should read reviews before buying a Groupon next time.

Looking forwards to the new book.
7965 2018-01-05 21:40:40 Got $5 off my oil change cause I was cute lol
7966 2018-01-05 21:40:40 @ipaccjdr screw this place. I was told just for an oil change and rotation it would be an hour, hour and a half, ended up taking 3 damn hours. Should have just told me would have taken that long instead of wasting my afternoon.
7967 2018-01-05 21:40:32 All life has meaning bro, your own included. I feel your emotional pain. And I have physical pain daily too, greatly alleviated by cbd oil. Have you given it a go?

7976 2018-01-05 21:39:58 I was not writing about NOPR, but I have watched ISO try to put into place programs that would be sure to have fuel on site AND not get them in trouble with FERC (choosing oil? Choosing a fuel is not allowed for an ISO)>
7977 2018-01-05 21:39:54 Hence, Afghanistan (besides controlling their opium fields), Iraq, Libya (destroyed), Syria (almost succeeded, except for help from Russia), next on the list Iran (Oil, +a State-Owned central bank (no good), DPRK, Venezuela, Cuba etc. do you get the picture ?

7981 2018-01-05 21:39:20 Don't forget who will clean up their messes since oil companies will not be required to pay for the clean up.
7982 2018-01-05 21:39:12 Yep, I teach environmental so its literally everyday. Just did our government spending simulation the other day and now looking into offshore drilling. Wait until they do our oil spill lab, I lay it on thick (no pun intended)

7985 2018-01-05 21:38:50 go back to 2012 and ask those in the oil patch if oil would ever fall below $50?  Commodities trader predict it could be between $48-$68 in March 2018
7986 2018-01-05 21:38:37 Keeping fuel on site has been an important goal for winter reliability.  First ISO-NE started the winter reliability program to pay generators to keep fuel on site.  Then FERC got on their case: yes, it is necessary, but you are choosing a fuel (oil) and ISOs can’t do that.

8081 2018-01-05 21:29:56 people not being able to afford heating oil has been part of political discourse in med countries for years. and we re talking about countries were tempreature rarely drops below 5 during winter and heat actually kills people during summer
8082 2018-01-05 21:29:55 I just spent 26 minutes on hold with the oil company and then got disconnected 
8083 2018-01-05 21:29:54 4c-whose racist, bigoted remarks & actions have given other alt-right movements courage to act openly in other countries causing violence
4d-whose thirst for oil made such a mess of the Middle East that 45 can’t help but stir the pot more

8084 2018-01-05 21:29:49 I stayed home again today. We ran out of oil and truck couldn't get in the driveway, landscaper didn't shovel driveway, city plowed us in. But all is well now.
8085 2018-01-05 21:29:49 @patrickmgleason Your article in Forbes re Alaska oil drilling and Pebble was thorough. I'm a liberal invested in NAK. I hope EPA/Alaska hold NAK to enviro standards. I do object to the "adult" comment. Given POTUS we've got enough divisiveness w/o grammar school taunt/demonizing
8086 2018-01-05 21:29:48 Looks like the engine oil cooler has become an engine oil disposal device. And quite a good one, the entire undertray is soaked in oil.
8087 2018-01-05 21:29:42 I have a nut allergy and they do their fries in peanut oil 
8088 2018-01-05 21:29:40 Slide’s fortune is poetically built upon the backs of an ignorant and uneducated youth. We’re slowly becoming the corrupt oil tycoons we promised our fathers we’d never end up like but have always secretly hoped to be.
8089 2018-01-05 21:29:36 Now my hair tryna play me like it doesn't like the olive oil eco styler anymore. I got this big ass tub & it's making my hair crunchy as hell. A waste.
8090 2018-01-05 21:29:33 Unfortunately this is lottery/oil money
8091 2018-01-05 21:29:31 Simple oil of cloves...
8092 2018-01-05 21:29:24 The oil need to send a player back to maintain contract space. I think we are almost maxed out. I’m thinking Strome is going the other way here.

It was horrible.The poor innocent creatures dying. Even in my dreams, the blue green gulf waves became waves of black oil crested with dirty brown foam in which nothing could live.

8097 2018-01-05 21:29:09 My sweet dad bought oil for my furnace!
8098 2018-01-05 21:29:08 If anyone wants to come hang out at Christian Brothers while I get my oil changed stop by and say hi.
8099 2018-01-05 21:29:07 Go ahead. We'll sell our oil and gas to China.
8100 2018-01-05 21:29:06 1 no it’s not, pigs don’t have a social structure and pigs do not have capacity to judge and outweigh pros and cons,(dumb sources of food). 2 vegan diet =less land =no relavance and not what I was saying I’m talking about habitats destroyed by oil digging (u use fuel all day)
8101 2018-01-05 21:28:57 MORE MONEY TO YOUR BOMBARDIER FRIENDS?  MORE DOLLARS TO BUY THE NEWS and the snake oil? MORE POLICE TO GUARD OUR BORDER AND CONTROL CRIME? You can no longer fool anybody.
8102 2018-01-05 21:28:41 Ohhh that's cool. I burn resin. But will look into oil too.
8103 2018-01-05 21:28:37 If some of you already didnt know, cannabis oil treatment is a cure for tumors and cancer dont waste your money on cancer donations they wont release a cure even if they had it.
8104 2018-01-05 21:28:28 For scrambled or fried eggs and omelettes I put enough oil to coat the pan. For sunny side up I put a little extra; enough to be able to scoop the oil and pour it over the eggs.
8105 2018-01-05 21:28:25 Thieves is also a great essential oil for anxiety. Super calming. Also try some honey lavender stress relief tea. The brand I use is yogi. Try no technology an hour before bed and also stretching. Bed time yoga!
8106 2018-01-05 21:28:14 Extra virgin olive oil is just like regular olive oil except it comes with Star Trek bonus commentary
8107 2018-01-05 21:28:13 The tax bill you voted for opened up Arctic National Wildlife Refuge(ANWR) to oil & gas exploration so maybe energy lobby and Trump admin believe ok to go for offshore, Repub congress wil support.
8108 2018-01-05 21:28:11 Gee, maybe the windmills will power the Locomotives to bring the bad bad oil to us to keep the Capitol warm?

8114 2018-01-05 21:27:47 It’s hard to believe we can’t safety drill for oil in 2018. Has technology not improved?
8115 2018-01-05 21:27:45 getting your tires rotated, oil changed and washing your car feels so clean 
8116 2018-01-05 21:27:38 My car isn’t vegan. It doesn’t need an oil soaked rag rub down like some essential oil subscription. Shit.
8117 2018-01-05 21:27:37 Just before the 'accidential' BP oil spill Barack Obama said he would open up offshore drilling~then...................oops?????
8118 2018-01-05 21:27:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
8119 2018-01-05 21:27:34 @ASavageNation : I have listened to you for years and you must be coming down with Dementia! There are 30,000 direct drilling jobs in the gulf! 100,000 indirect jobs you fool! And more oil naturally vents into the CA esturine zone than all the spills in HISTORY! “Dr. MY BUTT !!”
8120 2018-01-05 21:27:27 It’s such a idiotic thing to do! Who could ever forget watching that live video feed of the BP well gushing oil for three months, THREE MONTHS!!Not to mention the lives that were lost on that platform, without oversight it’s doomed to happen again.
8121 2018-01-05 21:27:24 I cannot believe that plod is poking their noses into the procedures & practices of a private company. There are standards for every activity in the oil & gas industry plus risk assessments are done. Save taxpayers money and let plod chase criminals.
8122 2018-01-05 21:27:21 They took control of their oil reserves, we can't be having that, after the economical terrorism comes violent terrorism until we get our greedy greedy hands on the black stuff..
8123 2018-01-05 21:27:17 Well all men out there have had squeaking door for weeks put oil and then WD40 on the hinges no good! The wife said “why do you not just spray furniture polish on the hinges that will work” done that and completely sorted moral is next time DIY needs doing let her fucking do it
8124 2018-01-05 21:27:12 the reason is oil not strong valuable commodity economy or politic now, the price is very low
8125 2018-01-05 21:27:08 if anyone gets me some bootsie oil i’ll love you forever

8137 2018-01-05 21:26:05 It worked to clear mine for a while. I was pleasantly surprised. I never thought "pleasant" and "oil of oregano" would be uttered in the same conversation!!
8138 2018-01-05 21:26:03 I have a tendency to rest my chin on my hand when working. I also need pressure gloves to keep my wrists in place.
Yesterday one glove got garlic oil in it. Ew.
So I washed it. NOW it reeks of laundry soap. #cantwin
8139 2018-01-05 21:26:00 Yeah. Its all Obamas fault. 
Like oil drilling off the west coast? What is your carbon footprint. You must love the vhaos coming out of WH. Obama was organized. Trump is winging it all out of revenge.
8140 2018-01-05 21:25:54 “Collins comes out against Trump plan to vastly expand offshore oil drilling.” Yes, she’s against it, until she’s for it. She’ll fold like she did with the #GOPTaxScam, right Senator Collins? #Complicity #FauxOpposition

8145 2018-01-05 21:25:34 I mean I don't trust mechanics oil. I buy my own synthetic oil and filter and pay 10 bucks. It comes out around the same but better oil
8146 2018-01-05 21:25:34 Yeah I refuse to use anything but my toning coconut oil soooooooo
8147 2018-01-05 21:25:23 Companies should be treated in the same way, benefits and rewardsand breaks for doing good or providing nore jobs stuff like that and almost crippling fines for major mistakes like oil spills instead of charging every company on each barrel to pay for them
8148 2018-01-05 21:25:10 No oil!!!! Just salt! And water!

8154 2018-01-05 21:24:39 Why would we risk our oceans, beaches, and marine wildlife for just a little more oil? Especially when we know that we need to leave fossil fuels in the ground if we want to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
8155 2018-01-05 21:24:25 tbh argan oil is really good overall
8156 2018-01-05 21:24:13 @ANUCrawford  The more global growth, the more oil demand. Higher oil prices - let alone the next oil shock - have not been mentioned as a risk
8157 2018-01-05 21:24:08 Omg thanks i just bought that oil and i haven’t put it to use. I get really really bad smile lines. 
8158 2018-01-05 21:23:58 Done  Easier to achieve single use plastic than palm oil free but I’m in!

8162 2018-01-05 21:23:33 Honestly u should prob listen remember that one time u asked what change oil light meant :/
8163 2018-01-05 21:23:14 You bring your own oil and filter ?
8164 2018-01-05 21:23:13 Try using virgin coconut oil! Let it sit for a while and then wash it out.

8179 2018-01-05 21:21:58 I miss a proper service station. Not just a petrol station, but one where they checked your oil and water and washed your windscreen too.
8180 2018-01-05 21:21:54 Trump has so much going on every day it's confusing. Passing things behind doors (i.e. Tax off oil barrels) wants banks deregulated & so on. Stop him please

8182 2018-01-05 21:21:36 I love how ignorant, uninformed leftists like to play the Norway card. Zero comparison; only population of 4 mill. North Sea oil resources, homogeneous society AKA white. They tax on entire net worth & by the way have one of the highest suicide rates per capita. Go figure.

8188 2018-01-05 21:21:05 1) It's notable, looking at capex vs depreciation trends for oil service firms.  If estimates hold, by yr-end '19, they will have spent well under depreciation for 5 straight years.  They are de facto shrinking their industry, leaving it potentially undercapitalized. #oott

8196 2018-01-05 21:20:10 To bake:
Heat your largest frying pan on, your highest heat. Once the pan is hot, use a paper towel with some oil to wipe clean the pan (careful with your fingers).

Now Take the pan off the burner, use a brush to wipe a bit of butter on the frying pan ( finger nail size )

8202 2018-01-05 21:19:21 Trump, all you care about is Oil, Oil, Oil and more oil. You DO NOT care about the consequences of anything! You are unfit!
8203 2018-01-05 21:19:15 Agreed... and we'll be here waiting for "clean" coal and those jobs to return.  45 and his buds toasting stock market and oil leases to be sold to highest bidder.  yet note how little wages have risen against inflation
8204 2018-01-05 21:19:15 Do you realise you're agreeing with me without knowing? The club does not have Oil money. In a nutshell, Wenger has done great with a leaner purse. Maybe Kroenke will shill out money for us to also buy the league. Well, that is if our toxic fans don't run off potential signees.

8214 2018-01-05 21:18:38 Do you think this will work with a different oil? My hair doesn’t like coconut oil
8215 2018-01-05 21:18:25 I used coconut oil for the first time yesterday and I think I went blind #rookiemistake

8217 2018-01-05 21:18:00 Absolutely brilliant, no oil needed at all, crispy outside but soft and fluffy on the inside, a bit like James 
8218 2018-01-05 21:17:48 Kitten and spreading from side with oil.
8219 2018-01-05 21:17:48 It appears the Trump administration believes there will be no future oil spills that need to be cleaned up!

"You can't tell me you have FIFTY raisins on you."

"I'm gonna harness the sun to oil some dicks"

8222 2018-01-05 21:17:19 New brakes, oil change, now tires. Just wanna go in the house 
8223 2018-01-05 21:17:12 Thanks. I always want to be objective. Intuitively, I cannot believe the oil spill didn't have a significant impact on marine life.
8224 2018-01-05 21:17:04 Nigerians never cared to Ask how much was Saved on Crude oil Sales during Jonathan administration even though Obasanjo Cleared Naija Debt.
8225 2018-01-05 21:16:59 I'm old enough to remember when they did check oil, tires, washed our windshields so sparkly clean you needed sunglasses in Dec at the coast+w/fillups or during "gas wars" you'd get free Soup/Jello/Cottage Cheese etc-but all that took a really long time-wouldn't work now imo.
8226 2018-01-05 21:16:55 I am...Am...I'm...you need tailor-made remedial teaching in grammar and sarufi.
8227 2018-01-05 21:16:55 @jiffylube my son brought his RAV4  for in for synthetic oil change with a coupon for 5 dollars off & you charged him 95?He came home & told me what you charged Rip off ! it should be around 67. I called the store in Commack and he said well he signed the paperwork. Never again!
8228 2018-01-05 21:16:50 That time you were a huge Trump supporter and announced you wanted to be Governor of CA the day after DoJ goes after legal pot and 45 opens the coast to oil drilling.
8229 2018-01-05 21:16:48 In DR people didn't want wind farms off shore, unsightly, not good for birds, what about underwater disruption? Wonder if oil rigs are ok?

8231 2018-01-05 21:16:37 It will do nothing for us just the oil c companies they will ship It off to other countries and mae,a fortune. And, sdhould a spill happen no biggie. Even republicans,didn't want this bit it's TRUMP world alternate reality. Thanks propaganda channel fake entertainment all day.
8232 2018-01-05 21:16:33 browning setting: 2 skinless lean chicken breasts in 1 tbsp coconut oil for 3 minutes, add further 1tbsp honey and brown for 3 minutes
8233 2018-01-05 21:16:22 Not forcing every oil company to pay for something that could happen maybe potentially to one of them in the future and forcing instead for the companies be entirely liable for cleaning up their own damn messes like the adults they are and do it well the first time fit well
8234 2018-01-05 21:16:06 Yes one day Trumpians will discover they have been downright bamboozled by a slick snake oil salesman.
8235 2018-01-05 21:15:58 @SecretaryZinke Thank you Senator Cardin for standing against this Administrations assault on Federal lands and waters.  Perhaps POTUS45 would like the first new platform off the coast of Mar-a-Lago? Oil spills happen!
8236 2018-01-05 21:15:57 Nakwambia. Ulivyoborongeka huna afueni! It is a pity you could be having an A in Kiswahili...out of the fraud that used to be our Kenyan KCSE. You are not even ashamed to pass around nonsense as the sarufi sanifu!
8237 2018-01-05 21:15:53 They gotta oil up and grab more scrot or something. Hahaha
8238 2018-01-05 21:15:51 I cried every day for weeks after the BP oil spill. Every time I saw the water, I cried. I could not believe such devastation was possible from one incident. Now they want to destroy everything, kill all the beautiful creatures of sea and sky. My heart hurts. #DrillingIsKilling
8239 2018-01-05 21:15:47 Whip together 2 cups chick peas with 8 oz bisque. Mix in Olive Oil. Boil. Serve with love.
8240 2018-01-05 21:15:44 If you love the simplicity of stir fries, let me tell you about sheet pans and roasting. Chop, mix in a bowl with some oil and seasonings, spread out on the (lined) pan, put in the oven...and set a timer! Magic.
8241 2018-01-05 21:15:39 We have to say what was SAVAK for us not you stupid foreigner from corrupted&bankrupt country full of gangs&impovrished. SAVAK for us was like FBI, CIA to protect country from marxsist,leninism,maoism,Islamist terorists.1979 was coup d'etat orchestrated by Karter,Frence.. for oil
8242 2018-01-05 21:15:35 Wait, since when do we have vegetable oil?
8243 2018-01-05 21:15:28 I read. Not Trump. Troll-Yes. Antifa-No. At least Al took responsibility for what he did. Trump never apologizes or admit wrong doing-SAD. Don't understand how u can support him? The world is scared and so should U. I ask U to get him on the right track.  How's that for engaging?
8244 2018-01-05 21:15:04 I’m walkin around smelling like an almond joy from this coconut oil in my hair gd
8245 2018-01-05 21:15:00 you: warren is that baby oil on your tits

warren: that's not the point. let the past die casey
8246 2018-01-05 21:14:58 The table is set. All is ready. I light Shabbes lights. I use wicks in oil. Payton Blake lights hers as well. We both recite the blessing in Hebrew.
8247 2018-01-05 21:14:24 Good, we need to Import ZERO oil
8248 2018-01-05 21:14:14 Do you have solar cells and wind mills on you boat. Hell no you don’t. We just need common sense solution. Technology is coming like hydrogen but take time to develop. So for now oil is the solution.
8249 2018-01-05 21:14:08 はぁ！？ほしのさん？？
8250 2018-01-05 21:14:07 Thanks for that. Note that the article I re-posted was from January 2013. I tweeted it to call attention to the offshore oil threat, not the fishing issues, which were a small part of that 2013 article.
8251 2018-01-05 21:14:06 i put coconut oil on my face and now i want to eat my face
8252 2018-01-05 21:14:02 I just googled that.
8253 2018-01-05 21:14:01 1/5/2018 Baker-Hughes US Rig Count Total = -5 to 924, Oil-5 to 742, Gas Flat at 182, DIR = 64, HZ = 798, Vert = 62
8254 2018-01-05 21:14:01 Are you serious? BP oil spill, excuse me???

The whole world is moving to renewable energy and you want to drill everywhere? Do you know how many spills we have every year? You Trump supporters ARE INSANE!
8255 2018-01-05 21:13:49 Getting my oil change for $25 w a coupon
8256 2018-01-05 21:13:44 Came to get my oil change, and a husky came and lay down in my lap while I waited. I can die happy now

8258 2018-01-05 21:13:42 Because you would prefer oil drilling in the ocean by your beaches?
8259 2018-01-05 21:13:32 Let me rub some oil on you
8260 2018-01-05 21:13:30 A Village called Oldest Volume where you gift smiles while massaging beards with coconut oil

8262 2018-01-05 21:13:24 Contract Gauging: Raw Oil and Natural Gas production, making existing wells produce on a consistent basis
8263 2018-01-05 21:13:21 Well, Sen. Collins, do we always need to be dependent on the Saudis for oil?
8264 2018-01-05 21:13:17 Heat the milk so it becomes warm. ( not boiling, or hot , just above body temp..) 

Mix the flour, eggs, salt, oil, sugar, vanilla sugar in a mixing bowl with a whisk. If you don't have a stretchy mixture that you can whisk you can add a very small amount of milk here.
8265 2018-01-05 21:13:11  . . . sort of like mixing oil and water!

8267 2018-01-05 21:13:08 Put your head in the sand...or maybe keep profiting off the destruction of our planet. We'll never know, because it's too late to reverse or slow down the process. But the oil companies and other polluters will make billions more, until the end. Greedy bastards.
8268 2018-01-05 21:12:53 Man-flu rampant so it's been an evening of Blue Planet II, whisky mac and Olbas Oil. Now for my recreational drug of choice, Night Nurse, and sweet oblivion. Tarra.
8269 2018-01-05 21:12:51 Didn't say we are at it. Said it looms. & little to no sympathy for what is really a town based on government decisions to locate NEB & other critical services there, but pretends otherwise. Specially oil company management types who know full well they chose a cyclical industry
8270 2018-01-05 21:12:46 having an oil diffuser in my car>>>
8271 2018-01-05 21:12:44 They say engine oil is good kwa
8272 2018-01-05 21:12:41 Not sure what’s going on at Chelsea, 5 years ago they would have laughed at signing Barkley/Drinkwater and splashed whatever it took on world class midfielders.  Roman running low on oil??
8273 2018-01-05 21:12:40  what is wrong with this GOP!!??? Do they not realize that: (1) there’s still a glut of oil reserves so no need for this and (2) what are they going to do when we suck wveyrhing dry instead of proposing to invest in new technologies
8274 2018-01-05 21:12:39 Now lead in saving out coastlines from oil drilling, our water from pesticides from chemical manufacturers, our air from emissions and our DEMOCRACY from our PRESIDENT!
8275 2018-01-05 21:12:24 i really just want to lay up and get rubbed down in baby oil, ass smacked and all omg
8276 2018-01-05 21:12:22 Here's some things I loved today. My oil change by Ted's Tesoro. I assume too busy to be on Twitter but they are FANTASTIC. The wonderbug who paid for my DC at @McD_RedRiverVly in the car ahead , country songs and a nice chat with a mama here at work. It's a good day.
8277 2018-01-05 21:12:20 I've also read that he removed the tax on barrels of oil, which were used for clean-up in case of an oil spill.
8278 2018-01-05 21:12:08 For anyone else, non protected class, possession would be interpreted as being in close proximity or constructive control which he had.
8279 2018-01-05 21:12:07 Both Bushes were in the oil business. Dubya was a part owner of the Rangers for a while.
8280 2018-01-05 21:11:59 I live by my essential oils. It’s really an oil for everything.
8281 2018-01-05 21:11:58 Not to mention all the benefits they gave to the Military Industrial Complex, by starting multiple unnecessary wars. 
The broken world we live in is also because they helped the oil industry hide what they knew in the 70s about #climatechange.
8282 2018-01-05 21:11:51 inessential oil
8283 2018-01-05 21:11:49 Or I'm scared to overdose on pharms, but I dont think anyone has ever over dosed on cedar oil
8284 2018-01-05 21:11:31 Justo estaba leyendo su blog y me revolví tanto que ya saqué mi libreta de notas lol que según esto el LUNA Sleeping Oil tiene una forma super gentil que no descarapelas pero igual tiene efecto tenue ligerito
8285 2018-01-05 21:11:28 Chick peas, olive oil and lemon blended I’m goin .. lovely too
8286 2018-01-05 21:11:25 Though i am generally strongly opposed to #PoliticalCorrectness i dont understand your aggression: have you read the exact details of the case, proceedings etc as you seem so "certain" that everybody sucks? #legal #Immigration
8287 2018-01-05 21:11:23 What about an Iraqi flag to remember all the innocent people getting killed for oil?
8288 2018-01-05 21:11:16 All I gotta say is Avila beach that had a massive oil disasterl. Can you imagine an oil rig problem like the BP one?
8289 2018-01-05 21:11:11 @EPAPetroleum CongratS  to the new $WOGI Ceo Mr Claudio Fabian Aballay today! I look forward to hopefully a upcoming Press Release and Many Barrels of Oil! With the float only 100 Million and 2.1 Billion Restricted we could really appreciate with #Oil on the Rise! Happy 2018!
8290 2018-01-05 21:11:08 And on day five.... vegan brownie and tea in the morning, usual nice @Pret soup lunch. Chips and baked beans for tea. And, no, I didn't ask the chippie if the chip oil was vegan. #Veganuary
8291 2018-01-05 21:10:54 @kissreinol I’m confused putting what the filter at the end? The oil?
8292 2018-01-05 21:10:49 been at the car place for an over an hour getting an oil change....this is ridiculous
8293 2018-01-05 21:10:43 When you take your car for an oil change and they discover you also need brakes, and have a nail in your tire  #adultLife
8294 2018-01-05 21:10:40 No one wants drilling off their shores on Long Island or elsewhere. This is just another oil spill disaster waiting to happen. It has the potential to devastate both the Tourism & Commercial Fishing industries. GOP gets it wrong AGAIN!

8297 2018-01-05 21:10:20 “Just makin sure I get it all. Don’t worry I won’t be a perv and grab your ass or somethin. Were ya thinkin that?”

Her hands lifted off to move down toward the long legs. Starting at her left thigh, massaging it while she applied the oil.
8298 2018-01-05 21:10:16 Endless oil story
8299 2018-01-05 21:10:09 When was the last time you checked the oil? This service will easily keep your car running smoothly. #tips #carcare
8300 2018-01-05 21:10:08 I got a $150 gift card for Canadian Tire from the oil company for working over the holidays. 
That’s almost like a marriage proposal. Right?
8301 2018-01-05 21:10:04 Oil leaks and explosions are devastating to animal habitats, environment, and the economy. Clean-ups cost millions, billions.  There are far more important things affecting life then oil.
8302 2018-01-05 21:09:59 lol !!! did u guyzz by mistake found yet another 'unused' OIL rig there too 
8303 2018-01-05 21:09:51 Selling coconut oil and black soap Yo! 2018 is for clear skin
8304 2018-01-05 21:09:43 Love is sweet when you both understand each other & both of you have money.

I met this very lovely couple earlier today, they are both highly placed in two different oil companies 
8305 2018-01-05 21:09:43 Make sure you use the 12hr voltarol cream, so much stronger.
As others have said, turmeric and cbd oil. Drops under the tounge 3 x a day.
8306 2018-01-05 21:09:41 once i get benzoyl peroxide and vitamin e oil... it's over for u bitches
8307 2018-01-05 21:09:38 Also there was that big oil deal between Russia/Exxon ...that got shelved...that was worth billions  (500 or so ) if I remember correctly.  So now 45 approves drilling in AL and here we go... that deal is in play again
8308 2018-01-05 21:09:24 I'm using a stabilizer too. I turn it off when painting with oil or chalk like brushes only.
8309 2018-01-05 21:09:20 Right here in NIGERIA Rivers state.. P/Harcourt(in the Oil rich N/Delta)this soot is an issue of grave consequences... Resulting from crack down on illegal modular refineries destroyed as we proceed coupled with Gas flaring.
Nose mask isn't it all!
The unborn have to be salvaged.
8310 2018-01-05 21:09:09 I'm obsessed with lavender oil
8311 2018-01-05 21:08:58 Hey @sethmoulton Al Gore has the carbon footprint of a small city from $100 million he made from the sale of his tv channel to that dirty filthy oil producer Qatar. Any comment?
8312 2018-01-05 21:08:42 Indeed. And maybe some antibiotics, oil of oregano, wormwood and a few days in a sauna.
8313 2018-01-05 21:08:33 Do you k ow which oil company?

8316 2018-01-05 21:08:09 All that lovely North Sea Oil money squandered on dole payments, tax cuts, bribes and Trident.

You must have done well out of it!
8317 2018-01-05 21:07:58 Where I live we eat crepes. Not the french, Breton style but flat too.

Ill write down the recipe so you have an idea.

4 eggs,
200 gr flour (self raising)
50 cl milk
20 gr sugar
10 grams vanilla sugar
1 teaspoon of peanut oil.
pinch salt
8318 2018-01-05 21:07:44 AP has a story about Trump offshore drilling decision with photo of man cleaning oil spill. But there's no liberal bias. #fakenews @AP
8319 2018-01-05 21:07:30 I’m getting my oil changed rn and I’m cryin at the car shop !!
8320 2018-01-05 21:07:27 herbal tea plus honey and lemon (not groundbreaking) or peppermint oil in boiling water and put a towel over your head and the cup and take deep breaths
8321 2018-01-05 21:07:17 We also never ask what would they would like instead of just pushing the “realistic” careers that they want have on them. I agree students should have at least a basic understanding of those subjects. Someone I watch has an engineering degree and makes oil painting videos instead
8322 2018-01-05 21:07:14 Sawa basi. Kojoa ulale.
8323 2018-01-05 21:07:00 Love this!!!I never would have guessed this was an oil painting!!(WOW)It perfectly captures the beauty and strongwill of @erinkrakow so lucky and thankful we get to see her on @WCTH_TV with each new exciting season.#Hearties  @hallmarkchannel @billabbottHC
8324 2018-01-05 21:06:58 Maybe China or Russia would underwrite their secession for oil drilling rights?
8325 2018-01-05 21:06:53 A full tank lasted me a whole week. God bless that oil change.
8326 2018-01-05 21:06:50 "Hey, all I'm saying is, in THIS economy, you can't afford NOT to know about oil prices, am I right"
8327 2018-01-05 21:06:21 My brain's? Honestly. When did midgets learn to use the keypad?
8328 2018-01-05 21:06:18 Oil
8329 2018-01-05 21:06:14 Nah, not controversial among Floridians--even Repubs (who aren't elected officials) don't want oil derricks three miles off beach they go to (tho they probably want it on other beaches). But state lege Repubs love the idea
8330 2018-01-05 21:06:11 I would kill for the option of full service because some days I don’t wanna get out and I just really want someone else to check my oil and tires and I’m willing to pay.
8331 2018-01-05 21:06:08 Buying oil cartridges for my pen and bud is becoming such an expensive habit 
8332 2018-01-05 21:06:06 Hillary/Dems lost to a guy that's mentally unstable and didn't even want to win.

8334 2018-01-05 21:05:41 The "man" just gets crazier and crazier by the day.  I hope the idiot watches when the oil spills, etc., ruin the oceans and shorelines.
8335 2018-01-05 21:05:25 @ErinDixonWMTW I had to find a different provider to get my oil. I'm down to about 90 gallons. Tuesday I will get my delivery..I'm more concern to those who are worse off. Hopefully they can stay warm in this weekend stretch.
8336 2018-01-05 21:05:13 @jaketapper Does Rex Tillerson's stand to make himself even richer with Trump opening up Alaska and offshore oil drilling? I know the tax cuts will benefit him.$$$ I wondered about new oil drilling and his investments in Exxon Mobil..$$$. He is the only person saying Trump is ok.
8337 2018-01-05 21:05:12 Am Mary. Mary Mueni Kanini.
8338 2018-01-05 21:05:10 Oil futures being pushed to old high levels by the Kochs. Demand is way down, so they cut production as they did before the recession.
They are artificially pushing a declining commodity to cause a crash in the market. Prepare.
8339 2018-01-05 21:04:57 And their oil/gas industry donors.

8347 2018-01-05 21:04:26 Hi Karen, we use an oil blend that is 90% canola and 10% olive oil. It is organic and gmo free! Let us know if you have any other questions.
8348 2018-01-05 21:04:24 It's cheaper to go to Pepboys for an oil change but I been here for an hour and they still haven't started on my car AND I BOOKED AN APPOINTMENT. @pepboysauto DO BETTER.
8349 2018-01-05 21:04:19 How did you get to work today? Are the lights on in your office? Your home? Thank the oil and nat gas industry.
8350 2018-01-05 21:03:59 all of the money she was getting from oil companies
8351 2018-01-05 21:03:58 "How about restructuring power grids to depend on available regional energy sources (solar, wind, water, geothermal, etc.)"

But that has nothing necessarily to do with degrowth. That's just growth by harvesting sun, etc., instead of oil
8352 2018-01-05 21:03:56 LA nostalgia level: listened to the spicy sesame oil/black vinegar dressing for some reason.
8353 2018-01-05 21:03:52 Going #vegan ?? Salads with nuts, seeds & beans (& veggies).. soups with seaweed & oil (& veggies) go a long way, in many ways.

8360 2018-01-05 21:03:06 Dropped my car off at 9:30 this morning to get an oil change and the shit still not ready 
8361 2018-01-05 21:02:56 only if they find oil
8362 2018-01-05 21:02:54 I'd like to see more feminists in sanitation, merchant marines, oil rigs, coal mines, etc...

8365 2018-01-05 21:02:39 don't give a shit about marijuana. personally I think it should be up to the states.
Internet should be free, like it always was. The less government interference, the better we all ate. Drilling? Im for drilling anywhere and everywhere. Drilling for oil doesn't destroy anything
8366 2018-01-05 21:02:38 We hope you speak for west coast shores, as well as the east coast shores. Oil leaks know no boundaries and will affect the shores of Florida as well.  We hope you speak for the #ArcticRefuge as well.  Help protect animal habitats!
8367 2018-01-05 21:02:25 Considering how much driving I do, I'm amazed how my oil is still clean, seeing how I'm past the due date and recommended mileage...
8368 2018-01-05 21:02:20 Lovely .... so now we, the taxpayers, will now fully pay for the next oil spill. And there will be one.
8369 2018-01-05 21:02:18 Home alone on a friday night. Time to cover myself in a thick layer of coconut oil and not think about how much I want a cigarette.

8374 2018-01-05 21:01:55 Are your friends at ALEC, Heritage Foundation, & the Koch Brothers pleased at your continuing their agenda?  First the tax scam. Now oil drilling in the artic and offshore coastal regions. *Drill baby drill!* And surface strip mining on public lands.

Do you have ANY honor left?
8375 2018-01-05 21:01:52 PS don't forget, thanks to the tax robbery, oil companies do not have to pay for their oil messes anymore either.

8378 2018-01-05 21:01:47 There is no scientific reason for why olive oil and vinegar should be able to take scratches out of a wood surface, this is surely witchcraft.
8379 2018-01-05 21:01:45 you seem to be spouting alot of nonsense, fake this, hoax that.. The only phoney around is you, asshat! People are starting to see through your snake oil rhetoric.. Do the world a favor and go play in traffic. Leave running things to the adults!  Whiney baby!!
8380 2018-01-05 21:01:44 It is outrageous ... he’s pandering to the oil companies toward his own end
8381 2018-01-05 21:01:40 maybe try jojoba oil if you haven’t already? It’s supposed to be noncomedogenic, so it might be a good option for sensitive/allergy prone skin.
8382 2018-01-05 21:01:40 IT'S ASHAME BC I THOUGHT EVERYTHINGS OKAY AND THEN U TWEETED. IT'S LIKE PUTTING ANOTHER OIL INTO THE FLAME.
8383 2018-01-05 21:01:39 Got some beard oil and a comb from @TheGrimfrost resin and hops, going to grow my beard out for a few months to see what it can do ha.
8384 2018-01-05 21:01:39 Got this almond oil, let’s see how this does.....
8385 2018-01-05 21:01:36 I agree why they have not rallied but expecting them too. The floor price is at 51, so with Brent where it is they are Benefitting greatly. At 50 oil they are cash flow positive at $400 oil. And have a lot of oil, did a deal to accelerate a new project in Uganda.
8386 2018-01-05 21:01:33 drink water, use coconut oil. love yourself 
8387 2018-01-05 21:01:19 Loooool you can say that , I don't know why I love trading that smelly black liquid as much as I do ...pesky petro powers on one hand, ruthless big oil companies , sneaky OPEC and then the annoying spectre of US shale oil ..oh and don't forget geopolitical madness
8388 2018-01-05 21:00:59 Shell is facing two fresh claims in the UK over oil spills in Nigeria that communities say have damaged their livelihoods
The Bille Kingdom and Ogale community both lie in the Niger Delta, the resource rich and oil ravaged heart of Nigeria’s oil industry, where Shell has operated
8389 2018-01-05 21:00:58 You do know 2+2 will remain 4 no matter the amount of anointing oil you pour on a calculator?  leave physical for the physical and spiritual for the spiritual. #CommonSense
8390 2018-01-05 21:00:56 Try some Jojoba oil or Jamaican castor oil leave in conditioner. So it can moisturizer her hair

8397 2018-01-05 21:00:26  GOP ended tax to clean oil spills!  Call any human in Oklahoma and ask them how that works out.

Think Black Lung + Earth

Actually, any coal minor can tell you how easy it is to get a coal company to reverse its damage...  same logic.
8398 2018-01-05 21:00:17 Ha ha ha. Real name like Peter Njoroge when you smell Otieno Otiende from miles away?
8399 2018-01-05 21:00:13 We already have a new unopened box of baking soda, a new jar of organic coconut oil, and I have activated charcoal from bulk purchase for my aquariums. A good head start.
8400 2018-01-05 21:00:08 Then run around swiping oil from other's lamps, lol..
8401 2018-01-05 21:00:03 So you like Feds cracking down state marijuana rights? internet run by corporations?oil companies drilling offshore and destroying our coastal areas? spiking taxes on the middle class and giving cuts to corporations? isolating us globally? Stripping poor people health care?

8405 2018-01-05 21:00:00 We know it is a CIA creation. It’s about oil and the petrodollar. BRICS. Christians and Jews are protected in Iran as they were in Iraq and currently in Syria. The Ugly US Goverment are once again following Trotsky.
8406 2018-01-05 20:59:33 Had to reschedule my oil change/maintenance appointment tomorrow. There is no way I would be able to get my car out the driveway tomorrow morning.
8407 2018-01-05 20:59:27 Lets open everything up for drilling so we can flood the market with cheap oil and destroy our planet for a quick buck. #drilling #oil #oildrilling
8408 2018-01-05 20:59:24 “Alright, I ain’t much of a fan of them.”

She added, occasionally pouring a bit more of the oil onto her back. Moving down from the shoulder blades and toward the large rear.
8409 2018-01-05 20:59:19 @realDonaldTrump . Mr. President. The people of California DENY your offer to an offshore oil drilling proposal. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan . Ladies and Gentlemen on the floor. Speaker of the House. Majority Leader. This is disastrous for our ocean.
8410 2018-01-05 20:59:00 Which jokes are trending in 2018? I will be sworn before January ends?
8411 2018-01-05 20:59:00 It's a #RepublicanAmerica double whammy on us. Oil companies, no doubt, have had us paying for the tax they used to pay for cleanup. They won't lower prices, so that's one extra profit we still pay for. And then we pay again for the cleanups.

8414 2018-01-05 20:58:51 Shell accepted liability for the 2008 and 2009 oil spills, which devastated the fishing community's environment and destroyed its livelihood. ... In 2015, the company agreed to pay £55m to the Bodo community for losses caused by the spills.Mar 24, 2017

8419 2018-01-05 20:58:37 100% private business can't help you if the government is printing money and setting prices. And how relevant to economic growth/decline is private business if 98% of export is oil?

8421 2018-01-05 20:58:22 Angus King is always working to enrich himself and his friends in the junk windmill industry. He doesnt care about all the many jobs coming from oil drilling because it would hurt his bank account #MEPOLITICS

8428 2018-01-05 20:57:29 No I asked about working for Shell Oil.
8429 2018-01-05 20:57:24 Our market cap is looking ridiculous and the 29% stake taken by Africa oil at 30p is looking cheap, 3d seismic to come, surely there will be majors lining up in a que to farm into Guyana
8430 2018-01-05 20:57:18 When you’ve been waiting 20+ mins for an oil change and they still haven’t started on your car 
8431 2018-01-05 20:57:05 Nah I heard it from someone but I wanted to put oil spill but decided not to
8432 2018-01-05 20:56:53 #COT = spec book for #oil as of 01/02, net long 624,213; change of (7,948) or (1.26%) from prev. 632,161; 98.74% of 632,161 max on 12/26/17
8433 2018-01-05 20:56:52 much like this olive oil, i too, am extra virgin, pure and blameless in the eyes of the lord.
8434 2018-01-05 20:56:48 so not sure heating oil will be going bullish. Since it's the north east equivalent to NG
8435 2018-01-05 20:56:45 So, Trump unleashing offshore oil exploration and drilling... possibly his worst idea ever!?
8436 2018-01-05 20:56:34 @thejstank thank god for the oil spill.
8437 2018-01-05 20:56:28 British lamb needs to import fertiliser to grow the grass to produce the lamb. NZ lamb grows in a pretty much organic setting. Even allowing for the oil in shipping the carbon footprint is lower.
8438 2018-01-05 20:56:24 You'll get the fish oil construction company up and running.
8439 2018-01-05 20:56:19 We're sorry if you were alarmed! It's a mixture of oil and crumbs that can form during packaging and looks like peanut butter. Could you please DM us the UPC, expiration date, and the letters and numbers that follow? Thanks!
8440 2018-01-05 20:56:19 The oil lobby success in opening Alaska and now offshore to exploration and extraction should be no surprise - if it was Obama regulation must be eliminated no matter the potential harm.

8457 2018-01-05 20:54:46 I'm sure I fully agree. There is still a lot of oil to be extracted. We would not gain the same benefit as the Norwegians - I am under no illusion. As you said, that time has passed. I think the difficulty is that it is under the lease of private companies and...
8458 2018-01-05 20:54:42 Have you tried coconut oil? Making sense something
8459 2018-01-05 20:54:27 Great info on Coconut Oil!

8462 2018-01-05 20:54:04 Tullow raised equity and is aiming to be profitable at 50 oil. Cash flow positive,  and cutting down debt.
8463 2018-01-05 20:53:49 Scraping oil completely is foolish in my opinion, there are better measures we can take, but cheap energy is so important to those who can barely get by as it is. Wind and solar only would crush them. The renewables aren't advanced enough to be cheap yet. I hope it's soon though.

8465 2018-01-05 20:53:34 It’s fucking ‘drill baby, drill’ all over again. Fuck this. Doesn’t anyone care about there being a planet for your sons and daughters to live on that’s not caked in crude from oil spills? 
8466 2018-01-05 20:53:25 It's your money. Still pretty cheap for a multi millionaire, only 20?
8467 2018-01-05 20:53:14 Oil deals/opportunities coming into focus now...we will see Tillerson, Trump, Kushner, Pence, Vladimir Putin, Russian oligarchs, & how many more GOP profit exponentially
8468 2018-01-05 20:53:08 i have a gut feeling that someone stole my golden sand oil and i hope your fucking fingers fall off.
8469 2018-01-05 20:53:04 The BP oil spill crippled our tourism for months on Sanibel and Captiva islands. Makes no sense to allow this when Florida makes its living on tourism. Wrecking our environment and local economy. There goes the beauty of our state. Reprehensible.
8470 2018-01-05 20:52:54 Flies over and hands Alphonse the oil.
8471 2018-01-05 20:52:50 Go bore the Fox Sheep, Mr. Chaffetz. We are looking forward to the results of Mueller’s investigation. We are awake and I do not need anymore of your snake oil. Take your cart on over to Fox.

8479 2018-01-05 20:52:11 21st century...I recommend alternative energy sources. 
But I also support no off shore drilling for oil and if we used more alternative energy we would need much less oil.

8486 2018-01-05 20:51:30 Are you going to back down on oil drilling like you did on CHIP?
8487 2018-01-05 20:51:25 Is that Peter Reid? I thought it was the fella who sells brass hand oil down the market.
8488 2018-01-05 20:51:23 Beardbrand Utility balm is my favourite. I recently discovered it and will never go back to oil.

8493 2018-01-05 20:51:10 Akane grabbed some oil from her bag as she moved over the President. Her hands lathered with the tanning oil she’d start rubbing along the hourglass figure. 

“Also do ya want tan lines?”

8503 2018-01-05 20:50:36 Are you kidding? Look up the history of oil drilling off the California coast, specifically how the spill in Santa Barbara affected that area for 40 years. We have other energy sources, we don't have to rely on oil. BTW those jobs on rigs go to a select few, that won't help many.

8507 2018-01-05 20:50:31 "No, I ordered ten THOUSAND units of oil, not ten MILLION!"

Cue sounds of frustrations coming from the Admiral's office. Oh how he wished the last 2 hours of his shift would hurry.
8508 2018-01-05 20:50:27 So either oil spills stop or no one cleans them up. BRILLIANT.
8509 2018-01-05 20:50:20 Yeah! Do it! WF has the best, cleanest fish oil which is good for that...

8516 2018-01-05 20:49:34 We had it for ages last year.  Olbas Oil and Beconase spray helped.
8517 2018-01-05 20:49:33 Oil in New York has reached a level where profits are high enough to encourage a further expansion in U.S. drilling
8518 2018-01-05 20:49:32 Tax deduction to recover lost revenue?
8519 2018-01-05 20:49:21 A real man would change his own oil
8520 2018-01-05 20:49:07 Got oil? Has oil.
8521 2018-01-05 20:49:02 Apply lots of petroleum jelly or baby oil around the inner thighs it really helps 
8522 2018-01-05 20:49:00 Girl, mix chalk with coconut oil.

8524 2018-01-05 20:48:58 No because humans are complex creatures... not simple creatures such as a pig. I have a question 4 you why can u still use a petrol of diesel car everyday ? Or use the public transport that uses those fuels. They come from oil. That needs to be drilled for... destroying habitats!
8525 2018-01-05 20:48:51 It’s knowledge gained in the pub, gym or anywhere else that men congregate - I’ve known men who have rarely been out of Glasgow give advice on how to put out a fire on an oil rig or steer a plane to avoid an accident - and they believe themselves!?!
8526 2018-01-05 20:48:23 I’m giving myself a hot oil treatment, vibing to O.P.M., & eating a chicken quesadilla. Mi vida es perfecta hoy 
8527 2018-01-05 20:48:20 I would love to win the Facial Recovery Oil from eminence! #EminenceWinter
8528 2018-01-05 20:48:20 I so would love an oil diffuser! Thanks

8532 2018-01-05 20:48:12 Coffee doesn't mix with my writing. It's like sawdust in the oil that's my imagination. #coffee #writing #DoesntMix #WhyIPreferHotCoco
8533 2018-01-05 20:48:07 It looks like we have bipartisan support on this issue -- since our Florida Governor @FLGovScott opposes offshore oil drilling.  After viewing oil rigs this past summer near Curacao and Venzuela, I would not like to see similar activity near our beautiful Florida shoreline.
8534 2018-01-05 20:48:06 Maybe because the price of oil has been steadily increasing from the 30$ per barrel to over $60 in the last 18 months. That might also have something to do with it.
8535 2018-01-05 20:48:04 Used a bunch of @orshaircare hair fertilizer and coconut oil last night to deep condition my hair last night. Just took off my plastic cap to wash it and I have a perfect afro. Imma wash it later. The world needs to see this afro + @thelashpot’s petals.
8536 2018-01-05 20:47:59 ouch! shit happens I guess. Funny thing is I think oil is way more of a killer than NG
8537 2018-01-05 20:47:45 Oil had its strongest opening week for any year since 2013 as refiners and exporters whittled away at crude inventories tucked away in U.S. storage tanks #bloomberg
8538 2018-01-05 20:47:33 It was never meant to be funny even at once! You just can't punctuate correctly, can you? Arrrgh!
8539 2018-01-05 20:47:30 Hey, this is what it is ALL about. In early 2017 Rachel Maddow was reporting about this. It's something like over a trillion in oil. Trump, Putin and Tillerson (oil) Putin can't drill up there with all the US sanctions. That's why they were try to lift sanctions in 1st hour in WH

8541 2018-01-05 20:47:15 Just got some vitamin e oil cause Zendaya says she uses it, so it could save my life or completely ruin it. Let’s pray for the first one
8542 2018-01-05 20:47:10 Currently on like the 15th case of Judge Judy while waiting 2 hours for an oil change
8543 2018-01-05 20:47:10 someone should review Chevron, Exxon and BP casefiles for oil spills and  environmental hazards before any new drilling is considered in these areas.
8544 2018-01-05 20:47:09 .@IronStache's ties to big oil and gas, as well as his historically tepid (or non-) support for major progressive issues make him a distant second choice for me.

8546 2018-01-05 20:47:08 Once you start plugging up natural oil geysers in the ocean (that spew oil on a daily basis), then I'll believe you want to protect the environment, rather than being a progressive statist looking to continue expanding governmental reach, regulation, and oversight.
8547 2018-01-05 20:46:41 @CNN @jaketapper was the oil drilling rule meant as a gift to Tillerson?  Cabinet mbrs getting richer working for the American people.  People who fight for the country need welfare. What's wrong? #truth #Cheaters #fairness #Fact
8548 2018-01-05 20:46:22 He is also getting "Richer" under Trump, benefitting from additional oil drilling opening up Alaska & offshore for Companies. Plus being rich already, he makes more $$$ with Trump's tax cuts.

8552 2018-01-05 20:46:10 @RepMcEachin Thank you for standing up to this administration and saying NO to offshore oil drilling!

8556 2018-01-05 20:46:02 So I began using neutrogena daily foaming cleanser, the all in one acne daily scrub, and then I apply their daily moisturizer with an SPF of 50. Oh and I just remembered I use vitamin e oil under my eyes and put Jamaican black castor oil on my eyebrows every night.

8558 2018-01-05 20:45:50 There ya go Terrance! That's the spirit. I use baking soda to brush...and I use coconut oil (Organic of course) to oil pull. It actually heals teeth.
8559 2018-01-05 20:45:36 Offshore rigs are expensive to build and operate. The price of oil has recovered some but is still a little shaky and could easily fall.

There's not just a ton of exploration and investment going on right now -- everyone is worried about increasing the supply too much.
8560 2018-01-05 20:45:36 [9:38PM] @GiditrafficTeam: Incoming JAKANDE LEKKI from WORLD OIL FILLING STATION is slight busy currently #TrafficChief
8561 2018-01-05 20:45:33 Renewable energy is the way to go brother coal and oil are dying industries. America needs to lead the way in this new tech if we are smart
8562 2018-01-05 20:45:32 No, they're right. It's a job that's completely unnecessary and makes it harder for gas stations to even exist here. If they checked your oil or washed the windows, then it might actually be somewhat worthwhile. But they don't.
8563 2018-01-05 20:45:28 Big Oil defeats CA's petroleum reduction legislation, but I believe in the West.
8564 2018-01-05 20:45:26 つい最近まで元気にしてたじゃないですかー…
8565 2018-01-05 20:45:21 Then hopefully the Oil trade him while his values high......
8566 2018-01-05 20:45:16 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8567 2018-01-05 20:45:05 Castor oil. Does that count as food?
8568 2018-01-05 20:45:02 Thou encompasses Me about with Power, thou surroundeth me in thy Might, and my Head is Anointed with thy Oil of Joy and Gladness.

たぶん彼らは、私がいんちき薬か何かを売り込もうとしていると思ったのでしょう。

8576 2018-01-05 20:44:18 ...aaaand they will surely shell out 9,99 to buy the simple (yet addictive) mobile game "Star Wars: Lubrication" in which you steer droids to their well deserved oil bath in order to clean them.
8577 2018-01-05 20:44:12 Yeah like..create a squirrel moment.."here is something shiney to look at" ...mean while over here ----->oil clean up tax expired, off shore drilling..etc..but your not looking..blinded by the shine the other direction.
8578 2018-01-05 20:44:12 I just put in my vacation bid I should be able to get off the 22nd but I won't know until I come back from Toronto next week. If your off that while weekend I'll oil you up like a pig
8579 2018-01-05 20:44:02 @BrookeBCNN #RexTillerson is not a #Psychologist so who the hell cares what #Exxon man who by the way has not shown his ties to Oil company says about #Trump mental fitness? #CNN Its absurd .... everyone can see hear Donald's a #narcissist
8580 2018-01-05 20:43:55 That's kind of smart honestly "well the owner confirmed the oil level was good, it's not our fault it was near empty!"
8581 2018-01-05 20:43:50 Any brand of apricot scrub and when you wash your face, use a face exfoliator/brush. Also, use an essential oil after such as tea tree or rosehip.
8582 2018-01-05 20:43:49 Yes, well - China gets the oil. Exxon gets the profits. The U.S. gets screwed. AGAIN, thanks to Chump. #NotMyPresident NOT NOW. NOT EVER.
8583 2018-01-05 20:43:34 He's looking for one that will nationally announce that crude oil is gud for bones

8585 2018-01-05 20:43:30 The Barataria Bay Bottlenose dolphin population wasn’t studied until after the BP disaster, but before the oil spill it was likely close to that of the Sarasota Bottlenose population, which is 17%.

8588 2018-01-05 20:43:11 I firmly believe in oil pulling - Don’t listen to those ‘studies’ that say otherwise.

8591 2018-01-05 20:43:03 Jfc I wish they would just change my oil and let me go I've been here for almost two hours
8592 2018-01-05 20:43:01 I believe the US strategy to be a strong world leader well into the future should include maintaining significant US owned oil reserves.  Keep our oil in the ground and use/deplete other nations' oil first. Oil is power while we figure out how to be less dependent on oil.
8593 2018-01-05 20:42:56 Definitely something the industry needs to be mindful of in the years ahead i think. Drying all this extra milk into powders will be a problem if oil economies can’t afford it.
8594 2018-01-05 20:42:53 Next time it is the turn for the Clintons to repay The Turd, and give good millions to the useful Trudeau Foundation.   That is what Banana Republic politicos do to each other.  Also,Trudeau will be paid for snake oil speeches,after he is finished with this country.
8595 2018-01-05 20:42:52 Can someone recommend me some good beard oil too many options
8596 2018-01-05 20:42:48 Does Tillerson benefit from Trump's opening up for oil drilling in ristine Alaska and offshore? He has been the only one saying anything positive about Trump's mental status. Does have huge investments in Exxon-Mobil Mobil???
8597 2018-01-05 20:42:44 What happened to investigation in OK when he was attorney general? Remember something about his emails with big oil. The emails weren't released in time for his confirmation hearing cause he fought about it. He is corrupt to the core.
8598 2018-01-05 20:42:40 Why am i so good a smelling smoke from cooking oil

8600 2018-01-05 20:42:39 As I said earlier, not reading into LB stats at all and have said as much for ages. My evaluation comes from what I've seen from him as a goaltender and his flaws are they same as they were in junior. My point on Montoya is he actually has a resume
8601 2018-01-05 20:42:23 I live in hope of the wild animals in the woods opposite will dance oil in ala Cinderella and do it all for me 
8602 2018-01-05 20:42:21 "we'd be even higher if oil was up"...or so I was just told on @CNBCClosingBell
8603 2018-01-05 20:42:12 Your shopping list should basically just be lots of cruciferous vegetables (or anything that grows above ground) spinach, avocados, chicken, grass-fed beef, any fish, peanut butter, macadamia nuts, halloumi and other high fat cheeses, butter, olive oil, olives and coconut oil.
8604 2018-01-05 20:42:10 When I wake up and see my room door cracked when I closed it before bed, I lose my shit... Just put baby oil on their bathroom floor

8607 2018-01-05 20:41:52 It is a gift to the oil industry, remember he wants to take us back. MAGA does not mean looking forward, it means looking backward.
8608 2018-01-05 20:41:44 You will change your tune when one of those deep water wells will blow up like the Deep Horizon well and flood Alaska shores with billions of gallons of frigid oil gunk.
8609 2018-01-05 20:41:43 Just got Id'ed buying flax seed oil. Were they worried I might not be middle class enough?
8610 2018-01-05 20:41:32 Get this weed out my system, keep putting coconut oil and African oils in my hair, gain my weight back, etc. GET FINE ALL 2018
8611 2018-01-05 20:41:14 Most of that salary was in oil stocks and bonus money.
8612 2018-01-05 20:41:06 It was about rubles, oil and hackers.
8613 2018-01-05 20:41:00 Paid someone else to change my oil and transmission fluid. Expensive, but incredibly convenient. #Valvoline drive thru. Car runs great.

8615 2018-01-05 20:40:38 The left doesn’t even realize he opened up oil drilling. He’s rolling out his agenda right under there noses.
8616 2018-01-05 20:40:22 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
8617 2018-01-05 20:40:16 No joke; I wash My face with hand soap and then moisturize with coconut oil. That’s it.
8618 2018-01-05 20:40:13 Family Nutrition: Cool #Whip this January? Its first three #ingredients are water, hydrogenated oil and High Fructose Corn Syrup!

8620 2018-01-05 20:39:55 That whole coconut oil on your face thing sounds like a bunch of clogged pores.
8621 2018-01-05 20:39:52 Trump can’t read but he got the DOJ to investigate the Clinton Foundation, the GOP to investigate Christopher Steele, authorized gas/oil drilling in all US water, told the WH counsel to stop Sessions from recusing himself - don’t underestimate this man or get distracted by a book
8622 2018-01-05 20:39:32 About to take a baby oil bath and relax 
8623 2018-01-05 20:39:21 apparently, while we were all clucking over the new book yesterday, there were developments on immigration, oil drilling, pot laws, mueller's investigation, voter fraud, & aid to pakistan
(classic case of not seeing the dumpster fire because the circus parade is in the way)
8624 2018-01-05 20:39:20 @Uberlube- More than a lubricant, it can be used as a massage oil, body moisturizer, and to prevent chafing!
8625 2018-01-05 20:39:19 3 coats of moisturizer plus an oil based primer and my face still looks like a sandbox. Winter weather sucks. I’m ugly. Fuck.
8626 2018-01-05 20:39:04 ”Seadrill has one of the most capable, newest fleets of drilling vessels operating and a strong track record of safe and efficient operations that make it a preferred partner for many oil producers. Combine that with what should be a strong balance sheet post-bankruptcy”
8627 2018-01-05 20:38:59 Person I’ve never met: “whenever I see beard oil at the store, I think about you”
8628 2018-01-05 20:38:59 @Sunni_in_SoCal Norway drills for oil in the arctic.
8629 2018-01-05 20:38:55 Got hot oil in my eye but I’m fine, it stung a little.

8633 2018-01-05 20:38:36 #MAGA Great take the oil revenue and pay for Universal Health Care for every “Legal Citizen” in this country !
8634 2018-01-05 20:38:36 Because they are Russian Assets. The congressional members that are not assets are now busy protecting our waters from oil drilling, protecting state rights from immoral marijuana prosecution, helping tiny Tim find affordable health care.
8635 2018-01-05 20:38:33 “What? Somethin wrong with askin to join ya? Besides it’s not easy to get the oil on your back and legs if you’re not flexible enough, and even so ya can miss a spot. Without one ya might turn red instead of tan, believe me it sucks to burn up like that.”
8636 2018-01-05 20:38:23 Now you know how other areas feel about the drilling of oil.  I don’t recall you speaking out about the other areas.
8637 2018-01-05 20:38:21 Nah, probably need a heavier weight oil. I’m sure Sen Collins will come up with some good recipes! 
8638 2018-01-05 20:38:21 "Oil starved". Link/proof? You just pulled that straight out of your a$$, a lame regurgitation of your cult masters' pablum fed to you through the mainstream news. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder

8640 2018-01-05 20:38:19 Senator Collins should think about the importance of oil in the Northeast, not only for heat but transportation and the production of electricity. Why should the US be dependent on foreign oil when it is available here?
8641 2018-01-05 20:38:19 Coconut oil a teaspoon in the food x

8645 2018-01-05 20:37:47 Quick question, when it comes to getting the oil changed in your car, do y'all go by the date or mileage???

8649 2018-01-05 20:37:03 folks it's that time of year where i'm gonna be a huge bummer and ask u not to buy girl scout cookies cos they use palm oil. their plantations are desimating already endangered pops of orangutans and other helpless wildlife

8660 2018-01-05 20:36:29 Yall know I said my boyfriend and I like to constantly prank each other well I’m sitting in the bath and he came in with a glass of olive oil and poured it on my hair that I just washed! He better sleep with one eye open

8664 2018-01-05 20:36:04 They followed oil down, became unprofitable, diluted or raised debt to stay alive and now they are poisened / servicing debt/ over diluted without oil substantially higher than $70. Plus many fields in decline due to lack of capex. 
Focus on mc instead of share price #oil #brent
8665 2018-01-05 20:36:03 Should be any 10w40 oil ..castrol is to expensive x
8666 2018-01-05 20:35:53 Perfect & just in time for #Trump to sign off on offshore oil drilling. The next time we have another Deep Water Horizon-and there will be a next time-we the people will get the bill for cleaning up the mess.
8667 2018-01-05 20:35:48 Hellooooooo so I posted the start to my January cam schedule earlier! Today we have a Glitter Oil Show then a Shower Show to wash it all off  Not totally sure on time yet though!
8668 2018-01-05 20:35:47 But they are right when they told oil going to 40 when it crashed from 100 to 70..

8670 2018-01-05 20:35:39 Is your timeline a nice Christian boy? Currently searching for a military officer with a farmers tan that comes from oil money. Preferably with the last name Devereaux. 
8671 2018-01-05 20:35:24 I don't think it's necessary to say that you have to support the liberals just because you are in opposition to a project that only makes sense to the oil and gas industry. You just have to hold your party to account. Bad decisions have to be criticized. It's how the party grows.
8672 2018-01-05 20:35:10 It works for the Norwegians. But as I said before, I agree that we should not rely on oil - it does run out. We should use what ever we make from it to invest in other areas.
8673 2018-01-05 20:34:47 My mom: If ur cooking in an cast-iron-skillet, pan, pot whatever... u don't need to add much oil.. hmmm mek sense @my slightly/oily Ackee & Salfish....got it

8678 2018-01-05 20:34:16 This is why you check all your oil lines and filter before you fire off.  A lot of work to wipe that oil off.

8681 2018-01-05 20:34:12 No, No, No! This will not keep OUR oil prices stable. Need some drilling. But not all out drilling everywhere.
8682 2018-01-05 20:34:02 Data is kind of like crude oil. It's super toxic and a liability, and not terribly useful in its raw state. 
Refined, it's still a liability! But very useful if you have a machine it can power.

8692 2018-01-05 20:32:50 I hope u feel better babe!!!
8693 2018-01-05 20:32:49 Because every time the safety regulations get loosened more oil workers die and/or get injured on the job.
8694 2018-01-05 20:32:47 This protein drink tastes like tanning oil or a pina colada. I can’t decide.
8695 2018-01-05 20:32:41 I’m just saying getting a whiff of chicken fat when your lady whips off her 14 layers of winter wear ... not as attractive as the smell of coconut oil.
8696 2018-01-05 20:32:36 Alright.... I see. However, that is still a tidy profit being made. If we nationalised that, like the Norwegians, that would be our direct profit. And with an estimated $1 trillion worth of oil still in the ground (although not all currently extractable) I think we should.
8697 2018-01-05 20:32:36 Now, that's the truth. She caved to the tax scam - the same tax scam that eliminated the $.09 tax per barrel of oil that funded oil spill cleanup. Now taxpayers are on the hook for Big Oil pollution while Big Oil rakes in profits and our environment and citizens suffer.
8698 2018-01-05 20:32:33 A nice explanation. But what if the garage had charged £500 for the last ten services, and only changed the oil?
8699 2018-01-05 20:32:31 Yes, and because Calgary had higher wages before oil prices collapsed, immigrants moved in in large numbers.
8700 2018-01-05 20:32:21 …don't set your hair on fire yet, just because its open doesn't mean automatic drilling…there's details like leasing, oil in the ground, cost to get it out of the ground, state's rights issues, law suits, etc…
8701 2018-01-05 20:32:17 Also this week, the Trump admin said it wants to reopen the ocean off Washington and Oregon

8702 2018-01-05 20:32:03 I give @SethWickersham credit for facing the firing squad on @DaleHolleyWEEI and not hiding, but I'm still having a hard time buying a large majority of this story. Guerrero being a snake oil salesman checks out, think we all assumed that was the case

I'd rather use our abundant oil, Chelsea, why wouldn't you?
8704 2018-01-05 20:31:49 Y are people getting an oil change in this weather lol
8705 2018-01-05 20:31:49 Talk to any West Texas righand, we produce enough oil right here. They definitely don't want to work on an offshore rig, too dangerous.

8716 2018-01-05 20:30:45 What I’m saying is, extracting oil from the ocean actually helps the ocean and protects it. Rigs to reefs means artificial reefs fish use to sustain life, not cripple it. Extracting oil also alleviates the pressure associated w/ causing natural oil leaks which leak A. FUCK. LOAD.
8717 2018-01-05 20:30:20 Think about this...( 1)When flood comes, fish eats ants and when flood recedes, ants eat fish. Only time matters,  For soap making, oil is required, but to clean oil, soap is required......

8727 2018-01-05 20:29:16 Kicking off 2018 with a break even short position in #WTI for $59. Oil looks to be on fire long-term.
8728 2018-01-05 20:29:10 This man is so closely plugged into big oil, particularly the Koch Brothers, that we must vehemently oppose any move Pruitt makes.
8729 2018-01-05 20:29:06 Of all the things we have seen now, this is the most insane, arcane thing on the list. We fought hard to get oil companies to pay for their careless drilling mistakes, Exxon Valdez and the Gulf. Now the GOP sent us back 30 years! Outrageous! Complete irresponsible greed.
8730 2018-01-05 20:29:04 Ham, provolone, turkey, Swiss, avocado, mayo, and a touch of olive oil on a baguette.
8731 2018-01-05 20:29:03 Natural coconut oil what you make food with. It’s great and if they lick it then it doesn’t do any harm. X
8732 2018-01-05 20:29:03 You can't base your economy on a commodity like oil because of fluctuation in the market.
8733 2018-01-05 20:28:50 Basing budget on high Oil price when it is low is *mostly* bad budgeting.
8734 2018-01-05 20:28:37 What more could I ask of life... sitting in my bed lathered in body oil, wearing my fuzzy socks, and listening to posty
8735 2018-01-05 20:28:34 Yeah Big Tobacco and alcoholism are much better investments. Funny thing is they both kill you quick, but cannabis proven to kill cancer and solve so many problems things like oil, plastics and good old opiates have created.
8736 2018-01-05 20:28:31 Now we're gonna have to rebuild a whole new economy without oil, since they squandered all of it. And they've got the audacity to ask for the reins back.
8737 2018-01-05 20:28:23 An article stated that North Korea was suspected of printing super bills. Could be a good reason why they are having a problem with our sanctions. Could also be another reason why it could not be necessarily China or Russia supplying oil this is individuals with the means to doso
8738 2018-01-05 20:28:22 Haha. What maroon!
8739 2018-01-05 20:28:21 That's what happens when you haven't got WM to look after your oil for you. Scotland would have been a really wealthy country if it wasn't for them stealing our oil & squandering it. I only wish we'd have wakened up by this time.

8741 2018-01-05 20:28:14 French added that the fund’s current level of $5.7 billion “enables the Coast Guard to spend the maximum amount authorized by law to respond to a major oil spill,” which is $1 billion.

8744 2018-01-05 20:27:54 I'll take my unintended insult back,since uv not been too bad,the companies make the money,always been the same,the tax give was to save jobs and for further investment,they won't invest if they up the tax,that's why oil is finished as a cash cow,salmond was warned.
8745 2018-01-05 20:27:52 I love this roided, striated, oil and tan all over sexy as fuck look!
8746 2018-01-05 20:27:39 Cause the first oil spill didnt completely kill it and i represent big oil not west coast floridians
8747 2018-01-05 20:27:36 im steaming essential oils and just took two cod liver oil pills to the head. i refuse to get sick.

8749 2018-01-05 20:27:27 We all know, PRES AGENDA #1 .. T-Rex got his rich buddy, President Donny to allow oil companies to drill on America's coast lines. Wonder how much his oil shares in Mobil increased with that persuasion? Enough to lie? 

Hopefully, the #MuellerInvestigation takes him down, too.
8750 2018-01-05 20:27:20 Plus I’m using shitty break in oil. Imma go back to a thickher synthetic when I swap I think my motor is ready for normal oil now
8751 2018-01-05 20:27:17 #1  I have a story. I met a feminist the other day. Antifa, anti Trump stickers all over her car. She was having car trouble and couldn’t figure out how to open the hood of her car. She asked for help. I opened the hood. Engine was filthy with sprayed oil and chemicals.
8752 2018-01-05 20:27:11 Oops, they did it again. Indiana agency wrongly issues fines to stores selling CBD oil. – FLBC News #MMJ #CBD -
8753 2018-01-05 20:27:03 Thanks passed and have to increase fish oil tabs.
8754 2018-01-05 20:27:02 I reiterate  so long as oil importers are kicking well. Nigerian refineries will remain dead...
8755 2018-01-05 20:26:58 Yep, Wisconsin makes my fluffy coat look like a 200 gallon fuel oil tank, and a car battery maintainer and, and, and... I think I miss spring.
Happy brrrrrrr ccccold out.
8756 2018-01-05 20:26:55 Marijuana laws come from drug purity laws from around 1890. It was to protect people against phony fixes peddled by snake oil salesmen. The laws are archaic and unnecessary but not racist.
8757 2018-01-05 20:26:35 warm castor oil was terrible, and u were not allowed to vomit it
8758 2018-01-05 20:26:09 inner responsible me: you need to go get your oil changed today

/loud whirring sirens escalating/

okay, OKAY, you can buy one bath bomb from lush to use when you get home

/sirens slow to a contented purr/
8759 2018-01-05 20:26:04 Kinda like me yeah pretty much same and then I just lose oil pressure as it goes assuming cuz the heat is expanding stuffs
8760 2018-01-05 20:25:58 Price of oil is what *mostly* dictates the size of the deficit. And eliminating dependence on those revenues takes closer to 40 than 4 years.
8761 2018-01-05 20:25:49 You made the mistake. Durex play oil.

Amazingly, it cost him almost the full £15 too. Damn those organic cucumbers.
8762 2018-01-05 20:25:41 Yes but they are different entities and many that followed oil down should have gone up. Some have based the business on 50 oil
8763 2018-01-05 20:25:41 Paid all the bills, washed, now getting a oil change. I deserve fat blunts after this.
8764 2018-01-05 20:25:35 What the hell is he supposed to say? "yeah, he's bat shit nuts. We all know it, but I'm not gonna be the one to say it." Tillerson may not be qualified and all he knows is oil and Russia, but he's no dummy.
8765 2018-01-05 20:25:19 OHHHHHH. Thank you. That explains it.

On an entirely unrelated note, I'd like to donate several barrels of frying oil to Gov. Kasich.
8766 2018-01-05 20:25:08 "Credibility" and "Trump" are two words that do not belong together like oil and water.
8767 2018-01-05 20:24:55 Castor oil is the only other thing I can think of
8768 2018-01-05 20:24:53 "Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke promised to “listen to state and local stakeholders” as his department’s reviewed offshore oil and gas. But this proposal plan tells America that so far, the only stakeholders this administration has listened to are industry lobbyists." 
8769 2018-01-05 20:24:46 The Trump Administration wants to sell off our oceans to oil companies. If we let this happen, the next time you go to the beach take a picture, so you’ll remember what it used to look like. Tell Secretary Zinder to #ProtectOurCoast
8770 2018-01-05 20:24:41 Capitalism working? Remember why we had 2008 crash,was it the sick,elderly,disabled and poor?

Oh and bringing up Venezuela, without talking about the  global collapse in their main export, oil is dumb.

Social democracy has delivered the envied standard of living in Scandanavia.

8772 2018-01-05 20:24:34 Is India an oil country with amazing amount of money which is the case with Norway .
8773 2018-01-05 20:24:17 I wish Trump was drowning in all that oil spill thanks to @BP_plc Killed our fishing and whole way of life! Trump is just trying to make his rich buddies richer!!
8774 2018-01-05 20:24:16 Ahh the ol’ oil change upsell.
At least I’m not at the dealership this time so they’re not trying to sell me a new car.
8775 2018-01-05 20:24:16 Had ours nearly 10 yrs brilliant piece of kit done alot of wk now but no signs of wear, different machine on the front more reach and can get to more places, we did have  to put a bigger return pipe for oil flow

8777 2018-01-05 20:24:02 Get you a best friend who will pause her nap to come check your oil
8778 2018-01-05 20:24:02 Hair tip of the day: Organic coconut oil is great for ALL hair types! What I've found out is that it's best to use it as a sealant to help lock in the moisture after your moisturizer 
8779 2018-01-05 20:23:59 Alberta was lucky it had 2 sensible people step in or what you guys experienced when oil fell worldwide your province would have been even worse, keeping resources for later isn't always a bad idea, short term gains for long term losses
8780 2018-01-05 20:23:49 I dunno I think industries that normalize that kind of drinking have issues. In journalism it’s clear this year for all to see. Other industries where it’s that rampant are oil E&G and advertising, industries rife with their own unhealthy bull shit.
8781 2018-01-05 20:23:46 So grandmother responds to the befoulment of the earth by Trump and his lot. Coyote howls, storm surges cleanse and volcanoes will flow. Good response to oil drilling off her coastline
8782 2018-01-05 20:23:42 Get the chilli oil on the base then

8784 2018-01-05 20:23:19 Pathetic ! Previous generations knew real austerity : pre-WW2 if you know what that was ! People are starving to DEATH in oil rich Venezuela,thanks to Chavez,and Corbyn style government.Our Soldiers don’t shoot our own ppl either.
Corbyn wd create 
             Venezuela UK ! 
8785 2018-01-05 20:23:18 NO. We want ENERGY DOMINANCE! We want energy independence. The LESS, we buy foreign oil, the more control we have on global issues. We should ZERO BUY FROM VENEZUELA. Zero. Nothing. Zip. Nada. Get it? No more buying from world wide dictators. NADA.
8786 2018-01-05 20:23:11 Idea: The dog’s skin is getting really dry from the cold. I’ll rub some olive oil into his fur to help

Result: All my furniture is now much more shiny looking
8787 2018-01-05 20:22:31 I use oil free moisturiser and that seems to work well as long as I let it dry before putting on my foundation 
8788 2018-01-05 20:22:06 The sudden turn around with some GOP members is mind boggling. Something happened in their favor somehow. Now they are kissing ass and protecting this snake oil traitor. Why????
8789 2018-01-05 20:21:55 Like watching oil paint vs acrylic paint dry
8790 2018-01-05 20:21:48 ILLEGAL ALIEN. What da...he isn’t an immigrant.
8791 2018-01-05 20:21:39 My mom gave me a lecture on how her oil she wants is gonna be so good for weight loss and all that so I can buy it for her  she’s so cute
8792 2018-01-05 20:21:37 instagram but for aromas (like of these heavenly heavily garlicked and oil oiled roasting vegetables)
8793 2018-01-05 20:21:36 We don’t need more oil. We need clean energy sustainable solutions. The federal government is morally bankrupt and full of idiots like Trump and his supporters.

8795 2018-01-05 20:21:18 1. Page in House Intel Committee meeting said that he met with Russia's presidential administration and the head of investor relations at the Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft during his trip to Moscow in July 2016. 
2. Russia did not try to interfere in the election?
8796 2018-01-05 20:21:17 I have heard that some inject them with fat or oil.
8797 2018-01-05 20:21:05 Et méthode Coué ;-)
8798 2018-01-05 20:20:57 dno y boys don't start rubbing oil on their hairline, I promise you it's going otherwise
8799 2018-01-05 20:20:44 Castor oil was nothing. My mom used to dose us with Cod Liver Oil. One burp and the entire classroom smelt like Hout Bay...
8800 2018-01-05 20:20:42 the only mustard oils available in germany are all labelled "for external use" , but I am told that it is safe to use those for cooking. I was lucky with the first brand, but now I ended up with an oil that probably massaged my intestines, if all went well :)
8801 2018-01-05 20:20:40 “Ain’t no beard oil in jail Bitch” yooooo
8802 2018-01-05 20:20:40 My point is the Oil Companies sell the lie that we are energy independent. We wouldn’t have to rely on the middle east.
8803 2018-01-05 20:20:34 Screaming won't do anything. Oil companies can wait everyone out; they're in this for the long game. And the fix is in with government, especially the current one. Only way to prevent drilling in pristine places is to keep oil prices so low it's not profitable to consider it.
8804 2018-01-05 20:20:31 No, that’s an oil stain. Or do you mean the burn mark?
8805 2018-01-05 20:20:27 I’ve spent more time gettin my oil changed than I did at  the nail salon.
I’m so impatient. And it’s hot! 57 degrees?! Where’d the cold weather go??
8806 2018-01-05 20:20:16 Oh, holy hell. That is way too long for an oil change and them not offer to shuttle you to and from home or work.
8807 2018-01-05 20:20:16 Green energy has a carbon footprint but not as much as fossil fuel? What source do you get that from? I respect your opinion but agree with pros who suggest piping in dirtiest oil in the world may create environmental impact that proves too great compared to energy production
8808 2018-01-05 20:20:07 Stop putting coconut oil on your face unless you want c y s t i c acne
8809 2018-01-05 20:19:57 This oil change got my car feeling like a brand new car
8810 2018-01-05 20:19:45 Put coconut oil face to toe and I feel my body radiating in my clothes for real
8811 2018-01-05 20:19:44 see, this is what i'm talking about, that pizza is a BARREN DRY WASTELAND compared to the oiliness of ~~some~~ pizza strips.

it's not that there isn't any oil. it's just that there's so much less.
8812 2018-01-05 20:19:42 Oh no! Really?! Oh my God!!! So, when Steele said there was no evidence in the dossier, just raw intel, he was lying?! Keep on selling the snake oil to your stupid pals & Russky bot army #Possobich 
8813 2018-01-05 20:19:41 Go back to your mama's basement little girl she'll be down in a little bit to put oil on your back it's going to be a long 7 years for you liberal idiots
8814 2018-01-05 20:19:32 The only ones that matter in this debate are the ones making the investments in oil and gas. Everyone else is just an opinion. Money doesn't care about opinions.

8816 2018-01-05 20:19:13 Wasn’t Trump an official % beneficiary to the Rosneft oil deal with Tillerson and Putin in exchange for sanctions being lifted?
8817 2018-01-05 20:19:13 All he cares about is $ and having his ego stroked - which his what his dictator, oil company & million billionaire friends are practiced in.
8818 2018-01-05 20:19:11 When you’re all icky and congested - a few drops of Olbas Oil in a nice warm bath, ahhhh. #littlethings 
8819 2018-01-05 20:19:10 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
8820 2018-01-05 20:19:09 @GOP PLEASE STOP DEREGULATING ENVIRONMENTAL RULES.  OIL DRILLING IN OUR OCEANS ADVANCES TRUMP's AGENDA TO DESTROY OUR ENVIRONMENT. There are more important things than enriching corporations!!! Please help us and Mother Earth! Is nothing sacred to you but money?
8821 2018-01-05 20:19:06 The smart approach is to move away from oil
8822 2018-01-05 20:18:42 What?  Are your checks from the oil companies late?
8823 2018-01-05 20:18:27 You can never put TOO MUCH OLIVE OIL on things.
8824 2018-01-05 20:18:23 Raw coconut oil get you right. Have you looking like a glazed donut and your skin soft like baby butt
8825 2018-01-05 20:18:04 Make a deal that the first 3 have to go right offshore from Mar-A-Lago. Thanks for fighting against this terrible idea! Oil is not the future - even the biggest producing Arab countries know this.
8826 2018-01-05 20:18:04 Waiting on energy on my end..redeem my oil trade first hehe
8827 2018-01-05 20:17:53 Only way to survive against other European top clubs or Oil clubs.
8828 2018-01-05 20:17:47 Socialism for the rich (big oil) and extreme capitalism for the rest of us.
8829 2018-01-05 20:17:42 I'm fine, I was just stuck in the waiting room at a car dealership for 3 hours waiting for an oil change.
8830 2018-01-05 20:17:38 There are 42 gallons in a barrel, so saving 9 cents a barrel means the big oil companies can change their price signs to end in 7th tenths of a cent instead of 9/10th. #MAGA #TiredofWinning
8831 2018-01-05 20:17:10 I need to buy jamaican black castor oil for my hair.edges are damaged
8832 2018-01-05 20:17:09 Currently at a Jiffy Lube getting an oil change & I can’t wait for them to ask my why I waited an extra 12k miles to get one 
8833 2018-01-05 20:17:00 How did yr bumble date go?
8834 2018-01-05 20:16:44 Lol I feel you I do too. You should try brussel sprouts roasted with garlic . Yes tho 450 for 20 mins max you probably want to pay attention to them and cook them to your liking. Light olive oil u can put it in a bag or bowl with your seasoning toss it til its all covered
8835 2018-01-05 20:16:34 don’t buy Trump’s pro fossil fuel, anti-climate science based on best interest of US. I think $ involved  EPA found impact statement had conflicts of interest, inadequate, & based on oil prices that dropped $20 per barrel right after we don’t know enough for sound decision
8836 2018-01-05 20:16:29 Baby oil after the shower is grat and makes u v soft
8837 2018-01-05 20:16:27 vegetable oil all the way
8838 2018-01-05 20:16:23 Bc they want the state's to pay for it. Chumps oil CEOs probably asked him to eliminate that tax!
8839 2018-01-05 20:16:11 @realDonaldTrump 
Mr. President do you care about anything besides making money. Whee will our oil come from in 100 years.

8846 2018-01-05 20:15:04 Oil companies used to pay 9 cents per gallon in tax to go to clean up oil spills. You powered that tax to 0...permanently.
8847 2018-01-05 20:14:46 Hardened (hydrogenated) cottonseed oil, so mostly stearic acid. Tallow and beef olein (isolated MUFA) were also used.

8850 2018-01-05 20:14:14 Also can you please fight against the oil drilling in our coast of California.
8851 2018-01-05 20:14:12 Hey Florida Gov Scott, still not believing in climate change? @potus just opened your entire coast line up to oil drilling and pollution your children will have to deal with. Good job @GOP, kick it down the road and pocket the lobbyists and donors money! #VOTE2018
8852 2018-01-05 20:14:10 Huge cargo ships crossing the oceans use almost crude oil and put out more CO2 then ALL private cars in the World COMBINED.
Or, offsett of change you mentioned could be mitigated if humans started planting more trees then cutting. Every year World cuts 20% MORE trees then plant.

8856 2018-01-05 20:13:44 Lmao and she whispered it cause she knew she was damn nasty. Talmbout she ran out of moisturizer. Bitch olive oil perhaps?! Not fucking Mayo. You uncultured swine.
8857 2018-01-05 20:13:31 Quaint little oil spills here and there.
8858 2018-01-05 20:13:28 Since you hate oil and gas, shouldn’t you be transitioning life flight Maine to horse and buggy.
8859 2018-01-05 20:13:26 I think that exogenous factors (such as global credit conditions or the oil price) are more important for the RUS economy than capacity utilization, which is probably never nowhere near max capacity.
8860 2018-01-05 20:13:17 The @GOP won't be satisfied until every inch of beach is slick with crude oil, our air is as dirty as Beijing's, our drinking water is undrinkable and our children are poisoned with pesticides. Their idea of paradise.
8861 2018-01-05 20:13:16 My lil car killing me.. Had to buy a new set of tires , getting an oil change today , & still gotta put it in the shop the 15th

8863 2018-01-05 20:13:15 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
8864 2018-01-05 20:13:10 This is the wrong action at the wrong time. Technology has advanced beyond oil and coal, and the US can create jobs - and a sustainable future - and a thriving economy without growing oil production. We need to protect our natural heritage, our planet ... life on earth.

8871 2018-01-05 20:12:07 I have several short term solutions that even you probably wouldn't dispute:
End all oil, gas & coal subsidies
End all agricultural protection
Eliminate all free parking & mandatory parking requirements
Charge tolls for the use & congestion of all roads
8872 2018-01-05 20:11:54 I hate when people fry anything in coconut oil! HATE IT!

8882 2018-01-05 20:10:58 It's by omission. It's buffing the statue of him and ignoring the nasty bits.

You want to worship robber barons and white wash the Guilded Age, be my guest

8884 2018-01-05 20:10:46 The wealthy are always ready to file insurance and federal claims for clean up on their properties, whether hurricane, blizzard, or oil spill.  Congress will assure funding to be paid out of middle America’s taxes.
8885 2018-01-05 20:10:44 We cannot allow the federal government to continue pushing its special interests in oil. Renewable energy is the way of the future and will help preserve our planet for generations to come.

8887 2018-01-05 20:10:37 WM treated NS oil and gas as a means to inexpensively and reliably power UK homes and industry and modeled its policies around that; oil revenue also enabled WM to reduce taxes.
8888 2018-01-05 20:10:21 Oils: Olive, Avocado, or Grapeseed for sure. 

My hair doesn’t care for coconut oil so I try to avoid it altogether. But Olive Oil is the truth.
8889 2018-01-05 20:10:17 wow it's weird to see a human defend a oil company

8899 2018-01-05 20:09:39 Extracting oil from under the sea floor might prove to be the biggest mistake in human history. Some suggest that it might increase the natural rate & volume that thermal energy transfers from the hotter planet surface into the colder waters positioned above it. Aquatic warming.

8905 2018-01-05 20:09:03 The other nation (I'm guessing Norway?) also implemented a policy of high taxation and high levels of foreign borrowing ($642bn in 2016). They also have state-owned oil companies and much lower extraction costs.

8914 2018-01-05 20:07:25 So I went to the pharmacy and got me bio oil's  long-lost cousin. Let's see how this works now.

8920 2018-01-05 20:06:28 A shoutout to @ChinaUncensored . If China has an economic collapse, then North Korea probably won't be too far behind. Even if Russia is supplying them with oil.
8921 2018-01-05 20:06:23 We get it.

You’re sad oil revenue won’t be giving Chelsea any kickbacks.
8922 2018-01-05 20:06:21 Bro an oil change literally takes 20 mins . It’s been an hour Im pissed
8923 2018-01-05 20:06:15 Misread that as Gun at first and now I wonder your assessment of his having laid gun on table w/o a napkin. Gun oil fug up a table cloth, too.
8924 2018-01-05 20:06:10 On Dec 30 FMCSA issued an emergency declaration waiving HOS rules for truckers in 37 states delivering propane and heating oil due to frigid weather. Imagine that-professional truckers being trusted to deliver life saving supplies to people. Wake up Congress @POTUS NO ELDS needed
8925 2018-01-05 20:06:06 For oil I usually stay away from coconut oil it doesn’t help me. So I use the African bled oil (red cap) Walmart has it or blueberry bliss  their lil oil.

8934 2018-01-05 20:05:24 why does it take 5 years to get your oil changed

8948 2018-01-05 20:04:07 S-P-E-N-D-I-N-G T-A-X D-O-L-L-A-R-S on this nonsense. This is all they're doing. Where is children's health care? What's happening in Puerto Rico? Is the public really behind unfettered off shore oil drilling? Well let's just spend all our energy, money, and press time on this.
8949 2018-01-05 20:04:00 Umm... the oil companies pay tax on profits from oil extraction; we pay duty at the pumps. Are you saying that people in Scotland are taxed twice for oil and gas but people in rUK somehow aren't?
8950 2018-01-05 20:03:56 YES! Melted plastic. And maybe some oil.

8972 2018-01-05 20:01:58 It’s -3 outside in Montreal. how badly do I need olive oil? if I don’t have it, I won’t cook. which means I won’t eat. unless I order food, which I won’t. cause I did that last night 
8973 2018-01-05 20:01:53 Yeah, sometimes people assume fast food/retail always = minimum wage which isn't true. I've never once been paid minimum wage, even at my first job at 14, but that was during the oil boom in Alberta so I'm perhaps an edge case.

9017 2018-01-05 19:58:10 Coconut oil is one of those things that is super hit or miss for me. In my hair it makes my curls too greasy and limp, and on my face it removes makeup but tends to give me little papules if I use it too often.

9025 2018-01-05 19:57:33 "A hotter, more successful woman?"  You sound nice.  At the very least just as hypocritical as you're trying to call her out for being.
9026 2018-01-05 19:57:16 It's terrible news for the economy and our environment. There's a reason it was stopped. We are going backwards-coal and now this again? Find me a town in coal country that looks like Los Gatos, CA, and you might convince me that oil and coal are good for the economy. Such bs!
9027 2018-01-05 19:57:13 She also told us to eliminate vehicle idling - why does she hate the oil industry too?

9030 2018-01-05 19:56:58 Maybe it has.  But Montoya would likely be an easy trade in the off-season.  It gets brossoit what he needs in playing time and the oil a backup for the rest of the year.
9031 2018-01-05 19:56:47 Oh, that's true, too.... and then the black oil doesn't really have fingers...
9032 2018-01-05 19:56:40 Update on things.
1. STILL NO HEAT OR HOT WATER.  our building ran out of oil and the oil truck still didn't get here yet. 
2. 311 was notified, but, but they said to wait it out and see if the landlord brings heat back before 4pm.
9033 2018-01-05 19:56:33 Remember when Cenex didn't smell like KFC and deep fried oil..... those were the days 
9034 2018-01-05 19:56:22 My bet is he didn’t admit where he worked because he was afraid of being asked these questions more than just pure snake oil salesmanship
9035 2018-01-05 19:56:22 I don’t know what it is about almond oil but my body LOVES it. Whether I put on my body, face or in my hair, it just works like magic; my skin feels so supple and my curls are so poppin’ today

9039 2018-01-05 19:56:09 I already question who he is really working for. Ya think that offshore drilling thing has NOTHING to with him? Once an Oil CEO, always in the game.

9042 2018-01-05 19:55:41 I have normal to dry skin. I use an African black soap I forget the name I’ll check for you. Then witch hazel and rose water for toner. Tea tree oil. Vitamin e oil as a moisturizer when I’m done then an ambi fade cream for dark spots.
9043 2018-01-05 19:55:41 Where to find birds that aren't yet covered in oil.
9044 2018-01-05 19:55:39 @realDonaldTrump . i disagree, unless you are talking about your offshore oil drilling plan in the Arctic region and construction company on the WALL. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr .

9045 2018-01-05 19:55:34 Just not Alfredo..nice veggie but maybe with just some olive oil
9046 2018-01-05 19:55:30 Tea tree oil or ponds
9047 2018-01-05 19:55:26 I also recommend having a long hot bath with a few drops of Olbas Oil. It has a similar effect.
9048 2018-01-05 19:55:24 Can’t wait for your BFF to start drilling oil off your coast. @realDonaldTrump
9049 2018-01-05 19:55:13 ' write a 5 page paper on why oil
exploration should not occur in
your vicinity,  but it's ok to 
consume oil from other environments. ( Florida and it's
air conditioning needs )
9050 2018-01-05 19:55:12 Now that Tillerson says he’s “never questioned” Trump’s mental fitness, do you, or does anyone think, it might just be DIRECTLY related to Trump opening both coasts to oil drilling today?? Mr Exxon-Mobil—corrupt like the rest of them.
9051 2018-01-05 19:55:05 My love bought me an oil diffuser  seriously this is the best thing my whole room smells like Vick’s 
9052 2018-01-05 19:55:00 Continuing my #adulting theme, you know you’ve hit it when you spend your day off getting your oil changed, tires rotated and interior cleaned.
9053 2018-01-05 19:54:59 I love Murphys Oil Soap with the scent of my woodstove!!! Makes me happy!!!  :)
9054 2018-01-05 19:54:58 At the same time they are opening the California coast to big oil. What could go wrong?
9055 2018-01-05 19:54:47 My whole body need a hot oil treatment! 
9056 2018-01-05 19:54:44 I don't like the winter. It makes my joints freeze up! 

I need some oil.
9057 2018-01-05 19:54:41 In the time it takes to read James M Cain's entire body of work I could watch Wang Bing's Crude Oil once.
9058 2018-01-05 19:54:40 BTW I hear good things about consuming hemp or cannabis oil to get rid of cancer cells. Also watched video recording of a culture of them when oil was introduced, immediate cessation in cancer cells' activities and movement.
9059 2018-01-05 19:54:34 You're my sister from another mother I say it everyday! You're that dose of cod liver oil & Castor we all use to hate to ward off infection
9060 2018-01-05 19:54:14 LOVED this! Really appreciated that you added that you can still get omega-3 sources from wild rice, walnuts &  flax-seed oil (for those who are vegan or trying to eat less meat) <3
9061 2018-01-05 19:54:04 It's not too late for Meldrim Thomson's dream of turning the Isles of Shoals into a major oil port!
9062 2018-01-05 19:53:54 What is wrong with us"Nigeria " we own OIL we buy it at a high price.i can't understand the lost  Mr.Kachikwu is talking about.this is really terrible.we are in 2018.
9063 2018-01-05 19:53:44 True in reference to bitcoin, but not all currencies are backed by hope, there are those backed by tangible goods, i.e. gold, silver, and oil.
9064 2018-01-05 19:53:35 You are in the congress, get a law passed quit waiting for a president to write a note paper.  If you and constituents don’t want oil fine please use the law not Obama notes.
9065 2018-01-05 19:53:24 @JoyAnnReid @AliceOllstein And then Collins got played by trump. Oil drilling off the pristine Maine coast.
9066 2018-01-05 19:53:19 Hidden in the tax is a freebie for oil barons: 0% taxes per barrel.  This means that they will exploit our natural resources with a vengeance.
9067 2018-01-05 19:53:19 You gonna rub coconut oil on my scalp?
9068 2018-01-05 19:53:07 When TM did this the oil went on a four game win streak. But then again its Calgary so who knows (cares)
9069 2018-01-05 19:53:03 The southeastern one in Minnesota appears to actually be the Flint Hills Resources oil refinery.  The northwest one is the Sherco coal power plant for Xcel Energy.
9070 2018-01-05 19:52:58 Ok I will start and you fill in. I demand that Hindu stop killing their unborn baby girl every 25 second. I demand Israel stop killing babied at will. I demand we USA stop bombing countries where we need to build a pipeline, or get their Oil and steal their resources...
9071 2018-01-05 19:52:55 Yes , and some people knows Trump has been given considerable amount of shares from Russian oil giant Rossfnet , he is not even hiding it anymore since the GOP stands with him no matters what and not to mention his voter base
9072 2018-01-05 19:52:52 it has to be raw coconut oil? I have the refined one
9073 2018-01-05 19:52:50 So they pay roughly $1.8 million a day and the BP oil spill in the Gulf cost about $61 billion to clean up thus far, not enough insurance.
9074 2018-01-05 19:52:41 Unpopular opinion: I'm in favor of the new drilling bill if it means not another ounce of oil is purchased from the dictators in the Middle East.
9075 2018-01-05 19:52:41 State of the Union IS ...Trump has successfully sold snake oil to 35% of the USA !
9076 2018-01-05 19:52:39 I need a shorty that can oil my scalp and shit. Too much work
9077 2018-01-05 19:52:34 Heat, oil, brakes and now this bihhhh running hot 
9078 2018-01-05 19:52:34 Half million gallons oil continue to leak from USS Arizona.  Officials hesitant to repair due to respect for those buried. I understand this, but can anyone say if they were there, they would mind the leak being fixed?  I sure wouldn't mind.  Debt owed to those men, but wow...
9079 2018-01-05 19:52:17 Their duplicity is shameful, as they sink in a vat of their own made forked tongue spiced snake oil...
9080 2018-01-05 19:52:16 Trump is trying to pollute all the water The oil companies have not proven to be able to clean up spills. So what happens to the clean water
9081 2018-01-05 19:52:12 Use more Oil! I  Oil!
9082 2018-01-05 19:52:12 Coconut oil fixes all my problems when it comes too skin care

4. Hair styles to protect and assist with growth. 
5. Once a month do a hot oil treatment with any oil 
6. Satin head cap 
7. go diet and water
9085 2018-01-05 19:51:48 We would still need oil for all the plastic an other uses
9086 2018-01-05 19:51:37 If the US has more Oil than the Saudis why does it need to import so much?
9087 2018-01-05 19:51:35 The belif moisturizer The True Cream is the best I’ve used. If you add a few drops of oil it even better, but even on its own it’s serious business
9088 2018-01-05 19:51:31 Waiting in the lobby, cars getting an oil change, elderly man is passed out in the chair next to me and gold rush is on. Happy national whipped cream day.

9090 2018-01-05 19:51:22 the workers at valvoline are serenading me while they change my oil 10/10 great automobile service & song choices
9091 2018-01-05 19:51:20 NEW: @GovChrisSununu says "of course" he's opposed to oil and gas drilling off NH coast. north atlantic is (v tiny) part of @Interior's plan to open up new drilling areas.

9108 2018-01-05 19:49:43 My husband was a safety rep in the oil field and he witnessed how oil companies prioritize profits over safety. You are supposed to look out for us, not wealthy donors.
9109 2018-01-05 19:49:43 this system incentivizes fearmongering and has resulted in half the US being terrified of Muslims half a world away when the ongoing climate catastrophe and subsequent mass extinction go uncovered because half their ad revenue comes from oil companies and their corporate allies
9110 2018-01-05 19:49:41 I got an oil change 2months ago & it was a little leaky, so I told them that & some how it turned into needing to move my entire engine to fix that oil leak? So? He tried to scam me.
9111 2018-01-05 19:49:26 Folks the Republicans throwing everything they can out today to stop folks from talking about this book that was released this morning. I seen 5 different new story come across my phone in less then 3 hours. From Clinton Foundation to oil drilling.
9112 2018-01-05 19:49:21 Coconut oil definitely   
9113 2018-01-05 19:49:18 فيصل بن شافي خويك مافيه مبروك
9114 2018-01-05 19:49:16 Hence the oil example being incorrect since the oil sits on top of the water due to the different density.
9115 2018-01-05 19:49:13 This isn't actually accurate...if renewable energy was operating at the same level as "big oil" it's employ less than the oil industry since it'd be more automated and require less oversight...it's only higher and costs more due to R&D...once done those jobs go away
9116 2018-01-05 19:49:08 East Coast Republicans Slam Trump Administration’s Offshore Drilling Plan. Trump, in his gut, likes oil. Regardless of consequences.
9117 2018-01-05 19:49:07 @Jim_Jordan sidestepped all of @KatyTurNBC questions just now. Don’t let him on again. He’s as slippery as an oil spill off the cost of the US. He is completely unreliable.
9118 2018-01-05 19:49:05 But unfortunately real men don't bomb the shit out of other people's countries to steal their oil and destabilize their government and make money off the war. This is not a one sided war.

9123 2018-01-05 19:48:41 See is correct  and Trump is liar who has a agenda to support US oil companies interest not ours.
9124 2018-01-05 19:48:25 Proportion? Yes. But i believe there is a divide between belichek and Kraft and i believe Gurrero is a snake oil salesman hack.
9125 2018-01-05 19:48:18 Imagine having activities being questioned by an illegal alien. Not far fetched. It is California.
9126 2018-01-05 19:48:16 @Jim_Jordan Your pathetic attempt to rewrite history and obfuscate known facts makes you sound like a snake oil salesmen  You're only fooling the  #KatyTur #OutIn2018
9127 2018-01-05 19:48:13 THE GOVERNMENT has pipe lines for oil ,gas and every thing how about one from back east to the west cost for water it must be move billions of gals of water but it could be done they get alot of snow and rain a lot of very dry areas could really use the water HOW ABOUT IT
9128 2018-01-05 19:48:10 There is a draft registration that they would then find useful to pull from. We are the biggest arms dealer in the world and Trump loves to sell those weapons to our frenamies. War lines politician pockets faster than even oil.
9129 2018-01-05 19:47:53 For me it is. All you need to buy with it is a spray bottle for oil, and you're good.
9130 2018-01-05 19:47:44 I just want to treat people equally, I think junior is a huuuuge moron too.

9135 2018-01-05 19:47:24 Oil and gas companies enjoyed a happy new year as a government imposed tax expired. The 9 cent per barrel tax on domestic crude and imported petroleum products generated funds for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund #oil #gas #newyear #tax #expiration #ENN
9136 2018-01-05 19:47:20 Not sub...plane under water. black oil introduced. CREEPy!
9137 2018-01-05 19:47:14 It's also important to know your manufacturer as coconut oil is one of the most faked oils. We always use @CocoTherapy for that reason. There a 3rd Generation Family Farm to Table therapeutic grade oil, it doesn't get any better than that!
9138 2018-01-05 19:47:10 I think they’ve been bribed by the oil owners in Saudi Arabia though, has to be the case. Wahhabism seems a bloomin’ obvious threat to the rest of us

9143 2018-01-05 19:46:33 Soy oil has gone up but so has the amount of sedentary activity we engage in.

Kids don't go to the park anymore, they sit inside watching youtube on a tablet.
9144 2018-01-05 19:46:21 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
9145 2018-01-05 19:46:12 Political games with African countries and using Libyan's oil revenues kept the populace comfortable enough not to have to do manual labor.
9146 2018-01-05 19:46:10 Oil and gas companies today, and last 20 years, have mirrored the same playbook that big tobacco firms used in the middle of the 20th century. In fact, a lot of the same lobbyists are used. Think about who stands to lose by moving away from oil/gas?
9147 2018-01-05 19:45:56 If it wasn't 5 degrees I could just walk home and wait for my headlights and oil change  "appointments" are apparently meaningless.
9148 2018-01-05 19:45:46 You have to BURN OIL to recharge all of these batteries.

Can our power grids supply the amount of electricity these cars will demand in 10 years?
9149 2018-01-05 19:45:44 "Why can orange essential oil also be called “orange extract” by a company, and the consumer won’t be informed? How is the consumer supposed to make educated decisions when everything is disguised all the time?"
9150 2018-01-05 19:45:34 US crude oil futures settled at $61.44 (-$0.57) | Brent crude futures settled at $67.62 (-$0.45) #OOTT
9151 2018-01-05 19:45:19 @Jim_Jordan sidestepped all of @KatyTurNBC questions just now. Don’t let him on again. He’s as slippery as an oil spill off the cost of the US. He is completely unreliable. 

He looks like a shady Trump water carrier. America doesn’t need congressmen like him.
9152 2018-01-05 19:45:08 Aisha,I hope you're aware his first budget which was in 2016, about 60% was financed by non oil sectors. Recall,the militants actions in S/S against oil installation and declined oil price then. Cutting cost of Governance is not outside cutting down on recurrent expenditure.
9153 2018-01-05 19:45:02 God, I hope not. Not that snake - oil salesman. Besides, he'll be forced to reveal has tax returns...

If better, cheaper energy comes along, private industry will be there. Until better, cheaper materializes, oil is still king.
9160 2018-01-05 19:44:17 Where I live we depend heavily on the oilfields it's our way of life. I'm thankful for @POTUS. I do wonder though. Was the idea, buy up other countries oil while leaving ours intact for our future?
9161 2018-01-05 19:44:14 Trump's policies re'national parks and offshore oil/gas exploration and development loot the future for global extraction-based corporate profiteering
9162 2018-01-05 19:44:11 We just got some new *Dr. Jolly's RSO * Rick Simpson Oil * 1 Gram Scooby Snacks*
9163 2018-01-05 19:44:09 Both coal and oil!
9164 2018-01-05 19:44:01 Thank you for pledging to protect our coastline.

As of 1/1/18 the $.09 per barrel tax on oil companies, which was used to fund oil spill cleanup, has been eliminated.
9165 2018-01-05 19:43:58 I just wish this oil change could be free 
9166 2018-01-05 19:43:55 Happy #ForestFriday! Follow and RT for your chance to #WIN one of four special edition organic Damask facial oil for all skin types from @GreenPeopleUK! Closes 08/01/18
9167 2018-01-05 19:43:53 The public always suffers the cost of environmental disasters. We endure the long term effects to our beaches, oceans, communities. Much like we pay a gas tax to fund roads as part of the cost of driving, they should pay an oil tax as part of the cost of drilling.
9168 2018-01-05 19:43:37 This means that state and tribal trustees for natural resources need to maximally leverage the NRD (a/k/a NRDA - Natural Resource Damages [Assessment]) provisions of the federal Oil Pollution Act (OPA) & of CERCLA (a/k/a the Federal Superfund statute.
9169 2018-01-05 19:43:27 #Distractify need to watch other announcements. Investigation to voter fraud ceased. Opening gas : oil fields in Alaska. Some really important stuff going on. This book tells us what we have been told already.
9170 2018-01-05 19:43:19 #SNAP costs tax payers on average  $36/year,  oil subsidies $5327/ year. Imagine if we spent as much on protecting life as we do destroying it. #nodrilling #nofracking #resist
9171 2018-01-05 19:43:11 I cook mine like rice, then I mix it with chopped parsley, olive oil, an za tar, thanks I'll mix it with my salad. U can also look up recipes on pinterest
9172 2018-01-05 19:43:10 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for biodynamic juice, and put some benzene essential oil in my diffuser.
9173 2018-01-05 19:43:02 Yes...remember thought that US hasn't financed its own wars since WW2, when tiny % of US pop lived in SE US, SW US, & CA (no public transport)...& when US was net oil exporter & manufactured its own goods.  US econ would hyperinflate almost instantly as goods fr China stopped.
9174 2018-01-05 19:42:55 i’ve been using it ever since you first recommended it and it’s the first oil to not break out my desert skin and it really is a game changer so thank you!!
9175 2018-01-05 19:42:43 While it may be a factor, I have a feeling it's more of a matter of total consumption than the oil type used.

Veg oil is cheaper than animal fat, thus you can afford to eat a whole bag of lays in a single sitting because it costs $2.50.
9176 2018-01-05 19:42:41 Someone come take my car to get the oil changed and my tires rotated. I'll buy you food.
9177 2018-01-05 19:42:40 When you're stuck at home without acess to coffee or oil. Fml. #strugglecity
9178 2018-01-05 19:42:35 Voted no. The environmental/fishing/tourism values outweigh oil production. #MAGA
9179 2018-01-05 19:42:35 I’m a glory hunter. I’ll be long dead and the oil will have all run out long before City have more silverware than United

9181 2018-01-05 19:42:30 The guy at the oil change place remembered me from the summer because I was leaving to Austin and my car was messed up 
9182 2018-01-05 19:42:23 does anyone have any good treatments for acne scarring?? i’ve been using bio oil and that’s helped a lot w fading but
9183 2018-01-05 19:42:23 When I get mine changed I don’t even bother. The fact that I’m a guy getting my oil changed by them already outs me 
9184 2018-01-05 19:42:18 It's possible manually. But not by me hahahaha I think every thing can stay the same. And with the distributor running off the cam face it should work near factory. Oil pump may need reverse geared too but I'm not positive
9185 2018-01-05 19:42:16 Crude oil futures settle at $61.44 Down $.57 or 0.92%
The price of crude oil futures settled at $61.44 that was down $.57 or -0.92%. 
The high price today reached $62.04, while the low price traded down to $61.09.

9189 2018-01-05 19:41:37 Unfake news: Trump plan allows oil drilling off shores of all coastal states and lowers offshore drilling safety standards.  Exxon profits by selling oil to China while states assume risks.  This one may unite Dems and Reps. U can’t  make this stuff up.
9190 2018-01-05 19:41:13 better word here is hydrate. If ur skin or hair is lacking some of the natural oils it produces u can use oil as moisturizer.
9191 2018-01-05 19:41:12 Matco, only reason to encourage off shore drilling is for oil companies to make more money. It would be a matter of time for an oil spill to happen and destroy marine life and pollute the oceans.  Distuction! Stop working for campaign donors!

9200 2018-01-05 19:39:44 One benefit of being a member at the Greensboro Science Center is getting $5 off your express oil change
9201 2018-01-05 19:39:39 I am so happy for Belize being protected from OIL. But I am so sad that the @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump  have opened up OIL DRILLING in the #PacificOcean and so many other places in America.  That should NOT happen.
9202 2018-01-05 19:39:37 RT I educated myself; you should do the same.Go back to the 1970's; enlightening from oil crises to global cooling to global warming; 1987 truth about industrial wind turbines; goring+greenwashing. Stop closing Nuclear power plants; depend on 24/7/365+- energy resources for now.
9203 2018-01-05 19:39:19 
9204 2018-01-05 19:39:08 This is evil personified, I mean the Deepwater Horizon disaster should be enough to stop anyone from wanting to drill offshore. Secondly, it's not like we have an oil shortage, so why is he obsessed with polluting the Earth (let not forget his Coal fetish)
9205 2018-01-05 19:39:06 okay so, just because these fish oil pills come in "easy swallow minis" that doesn't mean you should attempt to swallow both pills simultaneously
9206 2018-01-05 19:39:04 Ah my friend and nana had this it’s a nightmare be gentle to begin with shower with an oil to soften all the skin and even massage oil on before you get in shower if skin not irritated then build in a natural based body scrub also keep skin moisturised after shower until back
9207 2018-01-05 19:39:01 Me a young blonde girl just impressed the men working at the oil change place because I know how to drive. As if women can’t do anything by themselves

9210 2018-01-05 19:38:55 We don't need the Spanish product like wine, olive, or oil
We can live without it
9211 2018-01-05 19:38:36 Fossil fuels are great, for short-term usage. But the price points have already been surpassed to the point where solar, wind, and renewable are now more cost-effective and efficient than using oil, gas, or coal. By delaying our action, we cede leadership and innovation globally.
9212 2018-01-05 19:38:32 So who's family we DMing today? jk man we needed that win tho eh lol love my Oilers makes for a great day following a W. @EdmontonOilers do more of that you will weed out the morons who make us the rest of us look bad!!! Loyal to the Oil in good times and in bad! :)
9213 2018-01-05 19:38:28 Oil Tot your too adorable to be ugly. Even your sleepy face has a disney attraction to it! Your forever "Teddy Bear" cute so get used to it!
9214 2018-01-05 19:38:22 & that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
9215 2018-01-05 19:38:14 Should we open the pacific northwest coast to oil drilling?
9216 2018-01-05 19:37:59 Yeah, imma keep my 09 Honda for now until I can afford $100 oil changes 
9217 2018-01-05 19:37:51 u kno these vegatables were eating rn that salad dressing that vwgeatbale oil used to fry the meal on ur plate THAT WAS ALL ME
9218 2018-01-05 19:37:46 This calming essential oil better fucking work.
9219 2018-01-05 19:37:32 Just a few years ago, 140,000 gallons of crude oil spilled in Santa Barbara, but now the Trump Administration wants to open all our coasts to oil and gas drilling.  We need more alternative energy and wildlife protection, not more oil spills and environmental degradation!
9220 2018-01-05 19:37:31 @theouai is my ultimate fave! Anti frizz and hair oil 
9221 2018-01-05 19:37:31 I hate getting my oil changed. $70 is entirely too much!
9222 2018-01-05 19:37:30 Still shout Lucyyyy Beeeee when I put in the old coconut oil in ...don't think I'll ever stop...must sound like a right twit...
9223 2018-01-05 19:37:23 When you get your oil changed and they don’t mention anything else needing doing...let’s pause as I skip off into the sunset 
9224 2018-01-05 19:37:16 I coming over,baby oil or ice rub?
9225 2018-01-05 19:37:13 Make sure it's organic coconut oil!
9226 2018-01-05 19:37:06 Trump's proposal for radical expansion of offshore drilling would open more than 90% of US oceans to oil drilling, including vast areas off the Atlantic, Florida and California whose cherished coasts have been protected from new drilling on a bipartisan basis for decades.
9227 2018-01-05 19:37:01 coconut oil!!! If you sleep with it on it'll sink into your skin overnight and it works miracles!!
9228 2018-01-05 19:37:00 Wind turbines in New England were completely useless in this bitter cold storm. Thank goodness for oil, natural gas, and coal to meet power demands.
9229 2018-01-05 19:37:00 Nonsense. Nearly all of these ‘benefits’ result from the massive fall in GBP or the rise in the price of oil. The real situation is high inflation, reducing incomes, falling confidence & no trading deals in view + 30000 new civil servants eating valuable resources=disaster
9230 2018-01-05 19:36:53 We support off shore drilling so America doesn't have to rely upon countries who HATE US having authority to regulate pricing and gouge us whenever they want. STOP AMERICAN DEPENDENCY ON FOREIGN OIL!
9231 2018-01-05 19:36:53 @ILMarijuanaLaws where in Chicago can I buy oil cartridges
9232 2018-01-05 19:36:38 The people who took the oil across state lines have nothing to do with the permit awarded in PA. There is no reason to revoke anything.
9233 2018-01-05 19:36:27 E45, baby oil and H2O is legit the best skin care everyone, save the wonga
9234 2018-01-05 19:36:00 You betrayed Alaskans and all Americans! Oil not the future of US or Alaska. Alaskan permafrost is thawing, coastal areas are flooding due to climate warming. And Retro-Lisa wants to drill more, including in ANWR. Dumb, dumb, dumb....
9235 2018-01-05 19:35:48 What's your problen, #NIMBY RT @marcorubio: I am urging the Administration to recognize bipartisan efforts by the Florida delegation to maintain and extend the moratorium on oil drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and to remove this area for future planning purposes.
9236 2018-01-05 19:35:45 I believe @aeberman12 can explain this to you in great detail from a geologist’s perspective (much better than I can).

Post conversion to kerogen, the shale formation gets saturated with oil, thereby initiating the migration process to a reservoir rock.
9237 2018-01-05 19:35:29 -23C this morning when I left my house.  Even with a new battery & synthetic oil my Honda CR-V wasn't quick to start.  Luckily it did start.
9238 2018-01-05 19:35:27 The days when oil changes were under 30 bucks.  Smh
9239 2018-01-05 19:35:13 Got people to believe in nonsense and took their money. Prophet? Snake oil salesman con man more like it.
9240 2018-01-05 19:35:10 From partial CS appointments, I see a dangerous angle: appoint a local to oversee oil & mineral resources. Best policy to forestalling any feelings of resources not benefiting communities is equitable sharing, not home boys mentality that brought this country where it's now!
9241 2018-01-05 19:35:06 The TV in the oil change place is on Judge Judy and honestly I can’t think of a more appropriate show for this place
9242 2018-01-05 19:35:02 El gas oil sube para todos, también para los agricultores comunes. Una boluda esa Soria

9247 2018-01-05 19:34:31 @POTUS @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC The American people would be as stupid as they are thought to be if they don’t understand; the off-shore oil drilling deal has everything to do with Trump/Tillerson/Exxon lining their pockets and enriching their friends. Sad

The Oil companies can just get away scott free after POLLUTING AMERICA?
9251 2018-01-05 19:34:02 I would be crying if my oil changed cost that much.  I pay $40 for mine and that includes a tire rotation

9257 2018-01-05 19:33:29 If I can get an oil change today I think I might take off to Yuma 
9258 2018-01-05 19:33:09 Someone spammed the thread trying to sell their snake oil
9259 2018-01-05 19:33:02 I think the answer is as simple as they are attempting to distract from all the positives the government is showing. Government expenses down, oil up, unemployment down and all we see from the #ucp is their continued bozo eruptions.
9260 2018-01-05 19:32:43 @MSNBC I bet there is a lot of oil next to Mar-a-lago.  @realDonaldTrump has signed off on drilling for fossil fuels there. Might put up a net to keep golf balls from clogging drilling machinery.

9262 2018-01-05 19:32:41 Heard there r many governors now protesting this.They don't want those offshore drillings on their shores.He opened up 90% of protected shorelines! It's obscene. Needs to give his oil buddies $. Should concentrate on alternative energies. Sorry - preaching to u! You know this. 
9263 2018-01-05 19:32:17 tea tree oil helps me with scarring & it's just I have huge pores that get clogged bc my skin is kinda oily
9264 2018-01-05 19:32:14 Bush killed a million innocent people in Iraq for oil. According to idiots like you, that's chill.
9265 2018-01-05 19:32:03 Nope. That's when they say that @jkenney 's return to Alberta and the hope of a UCP government is driving back investors and oil companies.

9292 2018-01-05 19:29:55 But,  gas prices didn't go down. In our area they went up! Just one more way
to help out the "poor" big oil people.
9293 2018-01-05 19:29:43 That is an interesting question! Historically it seems plausible, as most contemporary wars over territory are more tied to resources (oil) or the intrinsic value of that territory.

9298 2018-01-05 19:29:23 More than half of US taxes go to an imperialist military invading foreign countries for oil, minerals, opiates...and the US is involved in election interference/regime change in up to 81 countries.

9310 2018-01-05 19:28:20 So we should go back to a pc government that wasted years of high oil revenue? That tan in the red on 120$ barrels? Give me a break.
9311 2018-01-05 19:27:55 Yeah, nope. Oil is a dying antiquated source of energy not to mention is killing our only home. Earth

9315 2018-01-05 19:27:43 More fundamentally-- suppose by magic the west coast of the US extended out an extra 100 miles, and that extra space was average farmland, but had no special qualities (e.g. oil or rare minerals). Would it do anything for the US economy?

9320 2018-01-05 19:27:21 There have already been TWO oil spills in the US in 2018; one in the Mississippi River and one in the Gulf of Mexico near Louisiana. And the "tax relief bill" made sure we have no way to pay for cleanup.

#LOUDERin2018
9321 2018-01-05 19:27:19 Common sense regulations? The gutting & slashing of regs will cause additional environmental disasters like Deepwater Horizon. Why do businesses want this? To make more money. Why do you think you & your children will benefit from another oil spill?
9322 2018-01-05 19:27:16 Just switched from coconut oil to almond oil. Let's see what happens. New Year new oil! Shout out to @HeyFranHey.

9324 2018-01-05 19:27:10 Pat's position was the budget should've been pegged at $45 per barrel of oil against $75 by FG. She accepted but stated the shortfall will be complimented from other sectors of the economy,including borrowing for capital projects which eventually ended up in financing consumption

And before anyone asks, Venezuela has gone through crisis twice before Chavez, it's all due to the price of oil.
9337 2018-01-05 19:26:09 I hope this oil change don’t take forever

9339 2018-01-05 19:25:48 I hate when I talk about anything oil change related and some asshole always has to mention how they do it themselves. It's as if they only learned how to do it for the specific purpose of making others feel bad for not knowing.
9340 2018-01-05 19:25:33 Leadstache my man, this is funny coming from you as you are pro- oil pipelines.

9352 2018-01-05 19:24:18 Stop destroying America.  No drilling in ANWAR or off the Pacific Coast.  You already allowed an oil spill from the Keystone.  We need to develop clean, renewable energy--not dirty energy from oil or coal.

9371 2018-01-05 19:21:34 You probably know this, but I just learned that if your primer is oil based, then the foundation should be oil based as well, same for water based...water based foundations won’t work well with oil based primers...and vice versa.

#TheResistance #California
9381 2018-01-05 19:20:05 Off the coast of California, place nicknamed "Tar Beach" there is a well that was supposed to be dry. It is producing oil that seeps up through the ocean floor and washes up on the beach as tar balls. That stopped while it was in production. Started again when they quit pumping.
9382 2018-01-05 19:19:41 No. What you just posted is Fake News. The Russia investigation is really heating up, anyone REALLY watching you and the GOP realizes this book is perfect cover for things like oil drilling deregulation, the Russian investigation and the GOP providing you cover, DACA,etc.

9385 2018-01-05 19:19:20 Oil spills are apparently a "cost of doing (oil) business," (for some companies at least) and should therefore come out of oil company revenues -- 100%. The question is how we accomplish that application of cost: Amortization through taxation, or a direct hit at the incident.

9387 2018-01-05 19:19:18 And the flat earthers mock real science once more and do the fossil fuel industry's bidding.  Good job. While China and other countries zip past us with sustainable energy technology, we're bringing coal back and drilling for more oil.  Such gullible sheep.

9389 2018-01-05 19:19:09 States harmed by the new Tax Bill should eliminate their income tax system and replace it with an oil/gas tax.  That fixes the unfair tax burden shared by high tax states and helps protect the environment.
9390 2018-01-05 19:19:07 OMG. All I can think about is how long it would take to get all that oil off your skin..
9391 2018-01-05 19:19:00 So you're OK with drilling anywhere else, just not on your states coast? We need to be united as a country Mr. Rubio. We're either all in or all out. I'm not in love with offshore drilling, but I don't want to buy oil from the Middle East ever again.

9407 2018-01-05 19:17:28 Kidding aside, oil companies are ULTRA careful taking EXTREME caution throughout the process. They DON'T want the bad PR or the expense of such disasters. But human error and equipment failure happens.

9409 2018-01-05 19:17:08 Are you nuts? You've obviously never been on the coast (Gulf Coast, Alaska, etc) after a damaging oil spill. The costs are enormous, the lost revenue lasts for years.

You're sacrificing the health and well-being of all the coastal states for what? Corporate profits!

9433 2018-01-05 19:15:20 Would you guys like to do a whip cream show tonight instead of an oil show? I have whip-cream from a video I did earlier today. hehe Pie in the face.
9434 2018-01-05 19:15:18 Far less than Exxon and other oil companies.
9435 2018-01-05 19:15:12 Why remove someone who's given them a blank check?  The GOP lobbyists and ALEC write all the EO's.  He doesn't even read them. Do you think he wanted to be President in order to open up every body of water to oil exploration?
9436 2018-01-05 19:15:07 look in to orgone energy. they are world wide generating orgone machines. every known megalith everywhere are connected by lay lines. they utilize the earths natural energy system. its being kept a secret.....because big oil.
9437 2018-01-05 19:15:03 
9438 2018-01-05 19:15:02 Not having the yuan reserve currency per se wouldn’t matter as much if they control they worlds premier gold exchange, with gold convertible to yuan.

If new oil contract takes off +  Gold / yuan underwrites OBOR, US treasury left with debt, dead $ notes and $42 oz gold..
9439 2018-01-05 19:15:00 She pissed me off like girl fuck you and this oil change
9440 2018-01-05 19:14:58 Because Tillerson could care less what trumps state of mind is. He his own mission ...to rid Exxon of their fines & govt regulations, to ensure Russian sanctions are never enforced, and to allow Putin & himself to broker the largest oil deal in history.
9441 2018-01-05 19:14:51 Partisan Dems:
 "OMG! Trump opened all our oceans to oil drilling."
Me: "Obama bragged about opening 75%."

9442 2018-01-05 19:14:47 I want an oil diffuser !!!!!
9443 2018-01-05 19:14:46 Warnock lies on weekly basis. Most managers do. I wouldn't take what he says as Gospel. Buffoon Fernandes damaged Caterham & QPR. Fernandes's a snake oil salesman. I wouldn't trust him if he told me it was raining.  Fernandes through staggering incompetence blew £500m. I trust DM

9447 2018-01-05 19:14:33 @RobpacalypseNOW Forgot to tell you those oil capsules are said to be very good for people suffering with seizures as well
9448 2018-01-05 19:14:31 Hey Jealousy playing at the oil change place hell yeah
9449 2018-01-05 19:14:23 I’m a trained Oil Refinery fire fighter,  does that count?! 
9450 2018-01-05 19:14:23 What's disgusting is your lack of compassion for the environment!!! To drill is to do even more harm to the oceans. Look up oil spills. We need a real president  @realDonaldTrump
9451 2018-01-05 19:14:18 As well as anyone touching it in any way hopefully.
9452 2018-01-05 19:13:52 This house is 160 years old and it has oil heat with heated base boards but with the old windows there is not much you can do
9453 2018-01-05 19:13:51 We dropped off my car for an oil change and the guy who helped us out was cute
9454 2018-01-05 19:13:41 What Trump forgets:renewable energy is getting cheaper and cheaper. Good for our planet. This also means that if oil doesn't drop in price, it is no longer competitive. I would never invest in oil companies, the calculated deal is on renewable.
9455 2018-01-05 19:13:37 I put baby oil in my ear to try and clear wax. I then tried to flush my ear with water and it is more blocked. Anyone got any ideas/had it? (I haven't used to cotton buds.) 
9456 2018-01-05 19:13:33 I Be Putting An Ass Of Oil On My Face Bitch Ion Play  Bitch Y’all Shit Be Dry And Ugly Looking Dry Face Ass Hoes
9457 2018-01-05 19:13:26 No body wants Oil or Coal you idiot, The whole world except the country your embarrassing signed up to clean up the atmosphere !!!
9458 2018-01-05 19:13:11 just put oil in Saika's crayons. now we wait.
9459 2018-01-05 19:13:10 Oil is likely to turn into a dead investment within 2 decades. Any rally in oil prices above $65-70/bbl is likely to only accelerate its substitution unless oil lobby succeeds to kill all solar incentives. BTW, fossil fuels still represent the most subsidized energy source...

9465 2018-01-05 19:12:53 Are you paying attention this week alone, oil drilling, cannabis, oh forget it
9466 2018-01-05 19:12:50 Gojuchang, and the usual suspects (soy, rice vinegar, sesame oil etc etc)
9467 2018-01-05 19:12:49 If they try to put an oil rig in my piece of the ocean, I will chain myself to something. I will set myself on fire.
9468 2018-01-05 19:12:48 @lisamurkowski When there is an earthquake that totally takes out even one oil rig and devastates the ocean, sea life, wildlife, and environment what will you have to say? We are WAY over due for a huge earthquake. Think!
9469 2018-01-05 19:12:44 Hey so this is a tweet endorsing jojoba oil bc I rubbed it on my feet and their rlly soft now and I put it in my hair and it’s like two inches longer n very soft it’s a wholesome oil u can shoplift it from Trader Joe’s like I did
9470 2018-01-05 19:12:35 This morning my mom put my essential oil diffuser in my room while I was sleeping so I wouldn’t be so congested when I woke up, she’s too pure
9471 2018-01-05 19:12:30 My brother took my car to get an oil change (app’t was made a week ago) and when he shows up they tell him they’re 2 hours behind and to come back at 4. But should they not have called to let me know?
9472 2018-01-05 19:12:27 @BoreGuru you’re an oil guy right? Do offshore drilling economics exceed regular surface drilling or is the return lower?
9473 2018-01-05 19:12:17 U need canola oil to make ur meals
9474 2018-01-05 19:12:04 Put oil in the tank. Checked the nozzle, checked for air in the line.
9475 2018-01-05 19:11:50 @realDonaldTrump Oil Prices--NOT affordable for elderly on limited income--WHY are prices so high when we are drilling oil here in USA.  Mabe decrease exports!!
9476 2018-01-05 19:11:49 Before bathing your dog put a drop of mineral oil in your dog's eyes to protect them from suds.
9477 2018-01-05 19:11:49 As one of the many victims of the Deep Horizon oil spill, along with our innumerable wildlife victims, I didn’t think I could hate him and his GOP more.  I was wrong. I still find oil blobs on our beach every single day so many years later.
9478 2018-01-05 19:11:46 Hate coming to get an oil change & they try to get you to do other work like naw fam.. oil change that’s itt!!
9479 2018-01-05 19:11:32 Anyone who thinks this isn’t an upgrade for the oil should look at career stats.  Good move for a conditonal pick.
9480 2018-01-05 19:11:25 Interesting that Standard Oil is in all three of them, without ever really innovating.
9481 2018-01-05 19:11:20 plan made when Putin put Trump in office & Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.  This is a joint mission to benefit, oil men, Putin and Exxon. Following the foreign news cleared that up once Trump stole the office of President.
9482 2018-01-05 19:11:19 Obviously Trump , his Biz Scams, the wall & lock er up Rally's R an Circus Act , self promoting selling Snake Oil .
9483 2018-01-05 19:11:18 The cost of oil drilling is enormous. There is no guarantee finding oil. He is over his head on this. Our country is beautiful because we have environmental regs preventing ventures like this that will come with long term negative consequences that will take years to reverse.
9484 2018-01-05 19:11:17 Do you remember the biggest oil spill in our history and how Obama still gave BP a military contract? And then the EPA ruined Colorado’s water by unplugging a mine. The government isn’t great at helping the environment.
9485 2018-01-05 19:11:15 Not the biggest fan of eating an apple, but serve it with a kebab and douse it with old fryer oil?!! #sassy
9486 2018-01-05 19:11:10 Infowars?! That demented paranoid snake oil salesman is full of bullshit. Breitbart is just a softer more acceptable version of the Daily Stormer and no better than the Mail, Express and Sun. Not much more point me trying to discuss this with a conspiracy theorist.

9490 2018-01-05 19:10:51 That's fine as long as we ban any oil and gas going to Florida from the other states that allow drilling.  Fair deal to me.
9491 2018-01-05 19:10:46 "I want an oil diffuser" Taggin @blessedta #VicTsing #Giveaway #OilDiffuser
9492 2018-01-05 19:10:32 Wonder how Florida feels about offshore oil wells off coast? One spill is all it takes to devastate a local economy. Also is deregulating wells which means no safety controls bigger chance for devastation
9493 2018-01-05 19:10:30 The dispersants and other chemicals are way, way worse than the crude oil. Crude oil is natural, after all. It's certainly not good, but it is no where near as toxic as the other chemicals they used. Another example of the cover-up being worse than the crime.
9494 2018-01-05 19:10:27 I’m reading this while getting my oil changed lol. Weird coincidence.

9500 2018-01-05 19:09:56 Your best bet is food and water. Avoid foods that damage the skin like sugar and fried foods. Get alot of vitamin a and D which is in a lot of veggies etc. Even oils like black steed oil or tea tree oil can also help aid the process. U can get all of this at the local wholefoods
9501 2018-01-05 19:09:55 FOLLOW THE OIL $$$... PUTIN/RUSSIA!
9502 2018-01-05 19:09:42 I’ve never had to wait in line for an oil change before today...I am pressed
9503 2018-01-05 19:09:26 @craigmelvin  Offshore drilling/voter suppression w Hugh Hewitt. No opposing views Just GOP TPs.=Fox/False News. Shame.. do better. T/w Environmentalist a/b History of Oil Spills. U know Oil Spills? T/w Ari Berman Jason Kander a/b Voter suppression. Do Journalism not propaganda.
9504 2018-01-05 19:09:19 He just got the oil rights off the shores of America, he is a busy man.
9505 2018-01-05 19:09:18 I want an oil diffuser @mzmyrtlezplace @MOMiSHStyle @Melisastephens @MrsJNickels @LoriLeal1 @leyn16 @cameron777
9506 2018-01-05 19:09:13 And his lower regulations means MANY oil spills can happen
9507 2018-01-05 19:09:12 @davidfrum Oil spills happen, it seems everybody in the world knows that except the morons in the Trump Administration. Clean up costs can go through the roof man these people should not be in government.
9508 2018-01-05 19:09:11 My car won't be ready until well into next week the timer under the bad oil leak turned out it was bad but I'm just glad I got extra car insurance or else it would of ran me into 1,000's of dollars
9509 2018-01-05 19:09:10 Took my car in for scheduled oil change...and found my battery failed the test.  So glad me or my family were not stranded in these freezing temperatures.   God took care of us today.  Praise God!
9510 2018-01-05 19:09:03 Oil price started dropping since 2013,I recall the presentation of budget and the subsequent lecture at Lagos business school, then coordinating minister of finance and economy agreed to Mr. Pat Utomi's positions on the budget,even her press interview,and OBJ's cries on economy
9511 2018-01-05 19:08:59 New year, new oil change! Call today to make an apt! 760-630-0420
9512 2018-01-05 19:08:52 How and when did oil go bust? Can you enlighten me? I thought oil was doing rather well. The companies are all still there extracting it, making profits.
9513 2018-01-05 19:08:46 Climate....Crisis now.  Snake oil changing his terminology.
9514 2018-01-05 19:08:25 No it wasn't the case. One person was asking for the respect he deserved. 
I told you long Long back before MCD elections.
They are freinds and hopefully ll resume their relationship again. 
We shd not oil the bitterness.
Hope u respect my words.
9515 2018-01-05 19:07:56 Damn!!!  Where you THAT much for an oil change for?
9516 2018-01-05 19:07:54 Can the world stop already with the @LoganPaul thing. Its a mistake. He can't undo it. No reset button. Global warming is our mistake as a human. Blame yourself for burning oil with your fancy car and the plastic cup that you use for your coffee in the morning. Kapeesh 
9517 2018-01-05 19:07:42 Wasn’t it yesterday you were talking about a transitional doji and my lack of knowledge regarding the markets? Why is oil down today? #OOTT #WTI
9518 2018-01-05 19:07:42 Not to mention the increased risks of oil spills, wrecking the towns and wildlife themselves.
9519 2018-01-05 19:07:39 Haba, they’ve not started drilling oil in my hometown yet, it’s unlikely we will need an adviser for cleanup.
9520 2018-01-05 19:07:29 Thanks God. As we see in North Dakota, pursuing oil drilling can cause horrible spillage & pollution. Florida generates a ton of revenue in tourism. Oil drilling will be an eye sore, it will cause pollution that will be very costly. The cost to drill may eat up th Florida revenue
9521 2018-01-05 19:07:28 I just had to use my good olive oil to cook veggies and I almost cried
9522 2018-01-05 19:07:15 @realDonaldTrump WHAT PRICES ARE GOING THROUGH THE ROOF;
HOME HEATING OIL, NATURAL GAS HEATING, ELECTRIC HEATING STARTING TO, MEDICARE INCREASE, SOCIAL SECURITY RAISE IMPAIRED DUE TO MEDICARE COST, FOOD, DRYGOODS, ETC. ALL NEED ATTENTION.
9523 2018-01-05 19:07:12 Well of course hes not going anywhere.....Exxon destroys ours coasts, sells the oil to China.....and our super transparent government will pocket the cash! #Rexxon
9524 2018-01-05 19:07:08 Everyone dragging @SenatorCollins today for WHINING about a the policies of an administration she willingly sold out to is GIVING ME LIFE. STFU, Sue. Cry me a fucking river of oil and sludge.

9527 2018-01-05 19:06:58 In the same way depending on foreign oil is hyperbolic. Since 2009 oil production has gone up, imports have gone down. How has the EPA impeded oil production?

9530 2018-01-05 19:06:38 I remember reading one of your sample papers on the gold-oil ratio Luke , but have you looked at Shanghai gold exchange as alternative to insolvent (unallocated) London exchange. Do you think they’re trying to induce a run on the London market with their oil for gold ploy??
9531 2018-01-05 19:06:24 I will not buy any product from any oil company that drills off the coast of California. If I have to I'll buy an electric car.

9535 2018-01-05 19:06:03 PRC always takes advantages of “One China Policy, OCP” to threaten a democratic member, Taiwan. Recently, PRC used TW business cruise for transporting  the oil to help the N.K. Btw, TW never wanna be a part of PRC but has been trapped in OCP.
9536 2018-01-05 19:05:59 The crude oil/petroleum per-barrel-tax should, at least, be continued at its 2017 levels. A tax on #oil produced is the least we can do to establish a national #environmental insurance policy against spills and contamination. #climatechange #TaxReform #OSLTF
9537 2018-01-05 19:05:57 How much are you into the Mercer's for that big tax cut they got? How much are you into the rest of the Billionaires who you sold this country out too? Like the oil companies about your recent decision on offshore drilling?
9538 2018-01-05 19:05:44 No what I mean is Natural Gas as a Baseload. Nuclear, Hydro, Oil , Natural Gas and Coal are really the baseload options. Non Hydro renewables are really a waste of steel and concrete plus Money
9539 2018-01-05 19:05:39 Lisa Murkowski you seriously suck!
You have done many despicable things, but opening up the Arctic to
drilling you own it baby!
The Blue Wave will smother you
like the filthy oil will smother our last pristine and safe place for our beloved Polar Bears, seals, aquatic life, etc.
9540 2018-01-05 19:05:38 Got my car washed now tomorrow I'll  get my new tires & oil change
9541 2018-01-05 19:05:35 I can’t find peach color opaque / oil based markers anywhere....
9542 2018-01-05 19:05:34 more oil in 3 weeks.
9543 2018-01-05 19:05:32 One of the most ridiculous things I've heard today was Hugh Hewitt stating something like  off shore oil drilling was what God intended for us to use our oceans for. Disrupting our entire ecossystem for oil? I don't think so!
9544 2018-01-05 19:05:22 Well put Guy but conversely, and I'm playing devils advocate for a second but do you think that part of the motive of Gorda coming back, not from Brayden's perspective necessarily, but from Hansch's and the Oil Kings brass' is to package him off to a contender?
9545 2018-01-05 19:05:18 Holy crap, first the oil companies, now the beef industries. NDP are out to really destroy beautiful AB.

9548 2018-01-05 19:04:57 I hear this and I leave. These newer cars oil changes are crazy expensive.
9549 2018-01-05 19:04:46 No longer doing QE.  Reducing balance sheet.  Treasury now competing with rest of the markets for available dollars.  Oil imports way down so not exporting dollars overseas.
9550 2018-01-05 19:04:45 Disappointed isn't a motive. I'm guessing either you have a medical condition you think is helped (in which case the oil with THC extracted has the same benefit) or you wish to smoke cannabis to get high. Withdrawing support tells me your support was weak to begin with.
9551 2018-01-05 19:04:43 Just saw a sign "Butt oil store". I am still in grade 5.
9552 2018-01-05 19:04:38 That’s because they oil em up on the flicks!
9553 2018-01-05 19:04:36 @BibChr What do you think about Christians involved with MLM like amway, LDT (Leadership team development), and the recent cbd oil salespeople. Should it be avoided bc it is easy to become greedy or is it okay according to scripture?
9554 2018-01-05 19:04:33 NO thanks!!!! Global warming with 53 inches of snow in PA last week!  Drill baby Drill! End foreign reliance on oil! People want more pay, work harder or Automation Nation!
9555 2018-01-05 19:04:32 An Oslo Norway district court Thurs dismissed the case by 3 environmentalist groups that sued Norway for granting Arctic oil licenses.

9558 2018-01-05 19:04:18 We already produce a lot of the nation's oil.  This is basically just another slap in the face to the non-flyover states

9563 2018-01-05 19:03:49 Landing Cost of PMS is N171 per litre because of the increase in crude oil price, meaning that at N145 per litre, the Federal Government is currently paying a subsidy of N26 on a litre of the commodity.
9564 2018-01-05 19:03:47 Many of students have been deserted and called series of bad name like dullard, olodo etc simply because they  easily forget what they have been taught either in the Schools or Madrasah. 
Take a teaspoon of blacked oil with a glass of pure orange juice every morning for month
9565 2018-01-05 19:03:46 Offshore drilling is being opened up at the expense of the  environment, global warming and all coastal states which will be impacted.
Then of course comes huge oil spills we have seen in the past that pollute shore lines and poison birds & fish!
What a legacy to leave others
9566 2018-01-05 19:03:46 Salads with olive oil and vinegar are so good I have enough energy to climb a mountain
9567 2018-01-05 19:03:37 Damn it’s to early to cry lmfao it’s just that I ran out of extra virgin olive oil for my pesto pasta and Ion got money
9568 2018-01-05 19:03:35 So. Putting peppermint oil in a bath makes everything burn. They should put that on the bottle.
9569 2018-01-05 19:03:30 Why do oil changes gotta be so damn expensive
9570 2018-01-05 19:03:27 I hope big oil discovers an oil field directly under Mar-a-lago!
9571 2018-01-05 19:03:24 So the US imports oil from our peaceful neighbor Canada. Is this supposed to be a burn or something? Sounds ok to me.
9572 2018-01-05 19:03:22 Thanks bb!

9576 2018-01-05 19:02:36 Why do people use the Reuters one?  CCI mich better representation of commods. Crude oil is 23% of the weighting.
9577 2018-01-05 19:02:33 Am I the only one who gets super nervous getting my oil changed. First having to drive in perfectly. Then the absolute worst having to do my blinkers and honk my horn.
9578 2018-01-05 19:02:30 Fridays I work 8-12 on the east side then 4-10:30 on the west side so I dont really get a lunch break. Usually spend the off time running errands. Right now Im getting an oil change

9580 2018-01-05 19:02:24 exactly! people always complain how they can’t take it off but it’s really the easiest if you just use coconut oil and warm water

9582 2018-01-05 19:02:07 The south Atlantic on your other coast will strike oil first in 2020. The GOMESA moratorium ends later, 2023 on your Gulf Coast get, with it
9583 2018-01-05 19:02:04 Tories , neoliberals normal practice is to shift taxation onto the consumer. With Oil , ie petrol , that works in Westminsters favor as well as the Oil comps. Today over half the price paid at the pump is tax.

9589 2018-01-05 19:01:48 @StateDept Rex Tillerson got his agenda on oil drilling for Putin everywhere. @realDonaldTrump resign immediately
9590 2018-01-05 19:01:44 Gutting #EPA. Opening 1.5 million acres of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to roads and oil drilling, Erasing needed regulations on these industries. NOW opening up off shore areas to oil and gas drilling off our entire coastline. STOP fossil fuel profiteers! Say No to exploitation.
9591 2018-01-05 19:01:44 we dont have oil for the heat in the house so we had to start up the kerosane heater until we do get oil. gyhh

9597 2018-01-05 19:01:23 Ok so why hasn't he spoke on the fact that Russian ships were seen supplying North Korea with oil but only spoke on China. Then he chose to believe Putin over his own intelligence agency when it comes to him interfering with our democracy. Putin has something on him!!!
9598 2018-01-05 19:01:21 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He might be glorified.” Isaiah 61:3
9599 2018-01-05 19:01:17 If you care so much about the risks that drilling poses to our marine and coastal resources, why did you vote for a #TaxScamBill that opens up our precious #ArcticRefuge to Big Oil and Gas? Trump and R's won't stop until all of our coasts and lands are sold to the highest bidder.
9600 2018-01-05 19:01:16 I grounded my daughter for playing with her mum's oil. told her no cartoon for a week and she is asking me why?hahaha i feel bad already but i have to stand firm

9604 2018-01-05 19:00:38 Offshore drilling is greddy until a hurricane causes an oil spill , and there will be a oil all over the beaches that make these coastal towns money in the summer.
9605 2018-01-05 19:00:31 But but the tax cuts are for average Americans...if the oil companies don't have to spend to clean up mother nature they'll hire more people and pay them better to fuck it up faster......right?
9606 2018-01-05 19:00:22 Since this one cannot be blamed on Buhari or the APC, Oil companies might as well take it.

9627 2018-01-05 18:57:37 They ought to throw in the oil change, i should think!
9628 2018-01-05 18:57:36 I weathered the oil price storm and now my $COP stock is back in the green. Barely, but still up. Not including the dividends over the past two years either.
9629 2018-01-05 18:57:27 Striking that the opening of both coasts to oil drilling is the 25th most controversial thing to happen this week
9630 2018-01-05 18:57:23 Please stop any subsidies to big oil. They can survive on their profits.
9631 2018-01-05 18:57:22 I’m hoping people aren’t putting coconut oil on their face this year. Let’s just not. #staywoke
9632 2018-01-05 18:57:12 It was every kind of wrong.....  Too much oil & they 'fried', less oil & they stuck in the ring. Maybe needs shallow rings.  Horrible yeast smell
9633 2018-01-05 18:56:59 Looking at the long game.  The oil reserves of the planet will not last another 100 years.  If anyone can tell me how their grand children drive around with clarity, let me know.
9634 2018-01-05 18:56:59 I agree the oil rigs are unsightly. BUT, I do drive a vehicle that required oil in the manufacturing of it, and the gas to drive. I also rely upon oil to fuel the planes I ride in to get from one part of the country to the other, which I assume you can relate.
9635 2018-01-05 18:56:58 The CFP is as fixed as jai-alai. No legitimate champion till a "REAL" playoff exists. Pawwwwll is just an ESPN snake oil salesman.

9637 2018-01-05 18:56:41 I think in 20 years we'll be shocked we had to do surgery on the obese when a simple dietary intervention would have helped. Unfortunately, so many are behind on the science of #cholesterol that doctors convince their patients to eat less meat and more sugar/seed oil.
9638 2018-01-05 18:56:37 @charleybear7 Have you heard of palm oil Charley? Poor dog died after eating some washed up on coast in Norfolk.
9639 2018-01-05 18:56:35 Years ago I’d never have thought to use oil but my skin (and hair) changed a lot once I hit my 30s & even more after my first pregnancy. Crazy!
9640 2018-01-05 18:56:34 Perhaps oil and gas companies can pay for the sea wall.

9648 2018-01-05 18:55:43 Coal n oil is the future of the world according to trump.
9649 2018-01-05 18:55:30 How about Russia for selling them oil? Or is that off limits because they are potus bff?
9650 2018-01-05 18:55:30 Authorize oil drilling off Trump’s waterfront golf courses and see what happens.
9651 2018-01-05 18:55:21 I use a face oil year round and couple it with a moisturizer at night in winter. Only thing that works for me in this weather!
9652 2018-01-05 18:55:17 I see your point however it doesn’t matter what the actual story was as long as it was a negative oil story, as predicted.  If it wasn’t the anniversary, there would still have found a negative oil story. They have an agenda and it’s not news.
9653 2018-01-05 18:55:10 Not really.......CA needs money on a yearly basis from the federal gov, needs refined oil from Houston just to get by at a nominal basis.  Pretty sure we can get along without CA better than CA can get along without us.
9654 2018-01-05 18:55:08 I’d guess that it’s olive oil from the pesto 
9655 2018-01-05 18:55:06 Everyone I know on Wall Street is a Democrat. I think of Republican rich guys as oil men, factory owners, prosperity Gospel ministers, that sort of thing. Just as rich and self-absorbed, only the source of the money is different.
9656 2018-01-05 18:55:03 I went to the neighbor site and it seems he on our side. Strange. HMMM? OIL is the way we live. Life without it would be strange.
9657 2018-01-05 18:54:55 going myself to get my car an oil change, i’m a big girl now

9660 2018-01-05 18:54:46 Well u were right the first time,the economic case is worse now,oil is a busted flush,decommissioning costs are going to be astronomical,rather share between 60 million than 5 million

9676 2018-01-05 18:53:21 Right let’s see how you feel if oil jumps again! I remember the 70’S mr. waiting in line with two small kids for hours wondering if there would be gas left for us!

9680 2018-01-05 18:53:07 “California imports 70% of our petroleum products; our cars drive over 330 billion miles mostly on petroleum. If we reduce our #oil drilling in CA, which a ban on #fracking would do, we’ll import more oil by train or by boat, that doesn’t make a lot of sense.” - Gov. Jerry Brown.
9681 2018-01-05 18:53:03 Not under obummer they didn't..under Republican leadership we are opening oil jobs and coal jobs by the 10s of thousands as well as deregulation on skilled trade jobs now boomimg

9686 2018-01-05 18:52:35 I have an oil question. Seriously how is he qualified #BlindLeadingBlind #AngryAmerican
9687 2018-01-05 18:52:32 It's an open secret in the oil analyst world that Aramco reserve figures are total discovered and never change to allow for production.
9688 2018-01-05 18:52:29 Why? We have the technology and engineering   let's go for it, sure is better than buying oil from countries that hate us.  Let them keep their oil,  we will keep our wealth.
9689 2018-01-05 18:52:28 Up till Dec 31st 2017, oil company were taxed cents per barrel to fund clean ups.

This year, Republicans let the tax expire. 0 cent.

While they are not only loosening regulations, Trump has also allowed drilling pretty much everywhere.

9693 2018-01-05 18:52:04 how else do you weaken Russia Marco, when their economy is largely predicated on petroleum and natural gas, by pushing our oil and gas resources into their markets quietly that is how, presidents think that way, you may want to consider this if you run again
9694 2018-01-05 18:52:03 It’s all good! Little things like that are just nice language variations we can use to be more inclusive because female =/= vagina etc

9695 2018-01-05 18:51:58 So is it true that the U.S. is now owned by big oil, the NRA and Russia?

9700 2018-01-05 18:51:29 @SecretaryZinke Leave the oceans alone.  No more drilling 4 oil which can cause catastrophic damage 2 the environment & this planet.  This shouldn't be about money. Come into the 21st century already & stop this madness. Stop killing bears & wolves. U really hate the environment.
9701 2018-01-05 18:51:20 That, and he's beholden to oil and gas billionaires. Since Zinke came on, this has been the plan - drill and frack from our public lands. All the rollbacks of EPA regulations have made this happen. Rich profit off our land, we pay for cleanup, land suffers.
9702 2018-01-05 18:51:12 President Trump just opened virtually all of our oceans to dangerous offshore oil drilling.
9703 2018-01-05 18:51:06 Every senator should oppose offshore drilling...  We are not so desperate for oil that America should chance polluting our oceans...  Alternative energy is readily available, but oil lobbyists successfully control our greedy lawmakers...  CONGRESS MUST STOP GOVERNING FOR MONEY!!!
9704 2018-01-05 18:51:05 Thank you!!
9705 2018-01-05 18:50:31 I think even though those are federal waters,that those are states rights the states have to contend with the problem after the oil platform is put in place,so if  The states don’t want it then the federal government should go along with that
9706 2018-01-05 18:50:24 This is just a big "f-you" to environmentalists, and a biocidal give-away to Big Oil. 
Anyone know how much $ dt has in the oil industry?
9707 2018-01-05 18:50:19 Benjamin Netanyahu: “Well we were lucky to be one of the few countries in the Middle East without any oil.”
Peter Greenberg: “You call yourselves lucky?”
Benjamin N: “Yes!”
Peter G: “Why?”
Benjamin N: (Pointing to his head) “Because we had to use our brains”.

Priceless.
9708 2018-01-05 18:50:14 @msnbc Get Hugh Hewitt off the channel Trump could take a shit on the pope and Hugh would spin it in trumps favor Hugh thinks Oil spills on the Jersey Shore Cape Cod Myrtle Beach Miami Tampa etc.. is a great thing since we should be going after more fossil fuels #FuckingBackwards

9710 2018-01-05 18:50:09 Oh shit I’m so sorry, I should’ve said performers with vaginas #so embarrassed....thank you for the tips! I do take probiotics regularly and avoid antibiotics like the plague. I usually use oil of oregano when I’m sick as I’ve noticed it seems to focus on the bad bacteria
9711 2018-01-05 18:50:08 Of course half my pay check from working the holidays goes to an oil change & new tires 
9712 2018-01-05 18:50:06 それだ…！！
9713 2018-01-05 18:50:04 CNN please talk about the oil drilling trump opened to big oil
9714 2018-01-05 18:50:01 My biggest pet peeve is when cooking videos don't let the oil and pan heat up a little bit and just throw the food in there like NOOO wyd!?
9715 2018-01-05 18:49:47 There, I ordered more orange oil for the diffuser and lavender oil for the laundry, and I need white vinegar for each to clean
9716 2018-01-05 18:49:46 Supplier of Edible Oil
9717 2018-01-05 18:49:45 We have a better idea! Put the oil drilling in your YARD  Ryan is you want it so bad^^^^^
9718 2018-01-05 18:49:43 If we go to war with NOKO. How will the history books explain the reason for the war? Was it about oil? Or human rights violations? No, two world leaders argued over who’s “button” was bigger
9719 2018-01-05 18:49:38 Cara Frances. Maggio 2018 vado in Italia e ritornerò a Cortona, Città che mi è piaciuto tantissimo. Sono brasiliana e abito a Rio de Janeiro. Dove posso comprare il tuo olive oil ?
9720 2018-01-05 18:49:32 Stop oil exploration, promote clean energy. Lets join the rest of the world to solve this problem
9721 2018-01-05 18:49:15 drill  and   suck  all  the  oil   outta   air!
9722 2018-01-05 18:49:15 I am inwardly fashioned for faith, not for fear. Fear is not my native land; faith is. I am so made that worry and anxiety are sand in the machinery of life; faith is the oil
9723 2018-01-05 18:49:02 This is a truly disgusting abuse of power and obviously an issue that was removed via donation. If it were up to me the spill fund tax per barrel would be significantly higher with a cap on the PPB allotment to prevent a consumer pass on. Big money oil giants = held accountable!
9724 2018-01-05 18:49:01 So annoyed I have to leave my apartment again. But I really need my oil changed
9725 2018-01-05 18:49:00 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
9726 2018-01-05 18:49:00 Who pays the billions of dollars when one or more locations experiences a massive oil spill? Trump going to write the cleanup check to make our beaches and shores pristine again?
9727 2018-01-05 18:48:54 Getting myself an oil change for my birthday, welcome to adult hood.
9728 2018-01-05 18:48:51 They lashed out publicly on customers’ complaints on eating next to the dumpsters and oil drums, happy to see them go
9729 2018-01-05 18:48:35 It’s basically just coconut oil but it’s supposed to ‘increase brain activity’ or something. I pretend like it’s the Bradley Cooper Limitless drug. Google: bulletproof coffee
9730 2018-01-05 18:48:34 President Trump @realDonaldTrump needs to replace & fire @JeffSessions. The man is terrible and will only make America pricks again. Medical marijuana is not heroin. Canibus Oil saves lives.
9731 2018-01-05 18:48:34 Go drill for oil in your back yard!
9732 2018-01-05 18:48:34 Bio oil is what's recommended in the UK, even the docs recommend it. Don't know whether it's safe to use around the eye area though.
9733 2018-01-05 18:48:28 Nestle projected water will b as expensive as oil (thanks to them for causing that to happen)~

9735 2018-01-05 18:48:24 If Trump had a fit because he could see wind farms from his golf course in Scotland what will he say about an oil rig off Mar-a-Lago?
9736 2018-01-05 18:48:24 We need the oil and jobs.  If we don't drill Mexico will!

9738 2018-01-05 18:48:16 I prepared it almost exactly as the recipe in the link indicated, except I substituted ghee for canola oil. It was delicious! 
9739 2018-01-05 18:48:13 Of course you will. I would expect nothing more from someone who thinks America should be dependent on foreign energy sources. Oil seeps from the ocean floor naturally off the coast of Cali. Why shouldn't we use it?
9740 2018-01-05 18:48:08 Films, combined with oil crisis, trucker protest, and imposition of speed limits elevated trucking and "trucksploitation" films into consciousness. Created symbolism of trucker as democratic everyman fighting injustice by the state. #aha18 #History #twitterstorians
9741 2018-01-05 18:48:08 Avocado oil is bomb too
9742 2018-01-05 18:48:03 Was going to add oil , lemongrass oil on a hankie on your lap and bingo

9744 2018-01-05 18:47:48 So you stand with someone that is going to get us bombed and millions killed.A person to open more oil rigs in the ocean I hope he will come and pick you up when they kill us.I praying for you
9745 2018-01-05 18:47:48 #SecretaryZinke Wants to start oil drilling on the East coast. North Carolina, South Carolina, Myrtle Beach & Hilton Head, Charleston are all tourist attractions and this will only HARM the tourist trade and jobs. #SCGOP #oildrilling #FireAndFury #FridayFeeling #ImpeachTrumpNow
9746 2018-01-05 18:47:46 So when I buy cannabis oil from a store selling it right now, I’m following the “spirit of the law” if not “the letter.” (;-)
9747 2018-01-05 18:47:45 The thing that's crazy is vegas accomplished in 1 off-season what the oil have tried to do since 2008 when they declared they were starting over fresh.
9748 2018-01-05 18:47:42 @MSNBC @matthewjdowd 

Why does MSNBC allow hack Hugh Hewitt to say rule allows oil drilling "responsibly" in all US waters when the trump administration is repealing nearly all rules designed to reduce the risk of oil spills?

It's Comcast pushing their fraud conservative agenda
9749 2018-01-05 18:47:39 I spray Caudilie grape water and while my face is wet I use the tarts maracuja oil and theeeeen I put my foundation. I also only set it in my laugh lines and around my nose 
9750 2018-01-05 18:47:37 Been sitting in the waiting room at the oil change place for about ten minutes. 

I’ve now heard “Don’t Stop Believin”, “She Works Hard For The Money”, and “Pour Some Sugar On Me” over the radio here.

I think I might be winning Friday.
9751 2018-01-05 18:47:35 @MSNBC Interviewing Hewitt about offshore drilling is like interviewing a plantation owner about slavery and tobacco.  "Responsible, environmentally safe drilling" is an oxymoron. Calling the Continental shelf--a treasure, "God blessed America with oil resources" is blasphemy.
9752 2018-01-05 18:47:29 my custom bergamot/tangerine beard oil from @luckyscruff got here yesterday, AND IT SMELLS LIKE FRUIT LOOPS. which is amazing, except I’ve been hungry all day

9755 2018-01-05 18:47:13 whatever you do, pls don’t drink the oil 
9756 2018-01-05 18:47:12 Why r u doing this? Move into the 21st century. We don't need another oil spill in the oceans or land. We r killing this planet  the burning of fossil fuels. Can't u think about alternative energy?If I could, I would fire u & find someone who cares about the environment. u don't.
9757 2018-01-05 18:47:04 The world petroleum story is one of the most inhuman known to man....everything depends on OIL.
9758 2018-01-05 18:47:04 Damn let me get this oil change 
9759 2018-01-05 18:47:04 US has worked w KSA since Nixon. Agreement was to protect them & sell them arms. When Saddam tried 2 sell oil 4 euros,when Gaddafi wanted to back African currency w gold,we invaded to protect petro $. HC is a war monger.
9760 2018-01-05 18:47:02 We used a heated dipstick in the oil at times when we had no engine block heater
9761 2018-01-05 18:46:58 Trump should be looking for a soul, and a moral code. He needs to be removed from office and sent to Mar-a-lago to watch off shore oil platforms be built for the rest of his days.
9762 2018-01-05 18:46:49 .@MSNBC why do you have lost. @hughhewitt on? How dare he lie and say the oil drilling will be safe when Trump lessened the regulations for drilling?
9763 2018-01-05 18:46:40 If @realDonaldTrump loves offshore oil drilling so much, I certainly expect to see him embrace drilling off the coast of Mar A Lago, preferably by same folks who ran well of BP disaster. Between rising tides and oil leaks, let’s make Mar A Lago Great Again!
9764 2018-01-05 18:46:37 .#Saudi direct aggression is the main cause of citizens casuals, tough blockade, food and medicine shortage and tens of massacres. Gov. employees not received salaries for a year because of #Saudi prohibition to export oil or local products.
9765 2018-01-05 18:46:34 That's fine, cbt oil is on order.  The idea with the shoe laces wzs the first time in 4 years that made any sense. Thanks I cant wait to tell him!
9766 2018-01-05 18:46:33 @RepTomMacArthur You stood by and let CHIP expire, you voted “yes” to raise my taxes while lowering your own, are you going to let your buddy @realDonaldTrump destroy NJ’s coastline & shore economy with oil drilling?
9767 2018-01-05 18:46:25 You are spending more than anyone else by a large margin.
Stop with your entitlement.
Stop causing wars for oil.
9768 2018-01-05 18:46:22 I've been oil free for a while lol i can text you
9769 2018-01-05 18:46:21 He didn't age well after moving to France, and after tapas, olive oil and freshly squeezed naranja juice stopped being a major part of his diet ;)

9771 2018-01-05 18:46:05 More oil spills on our coasts! Yay! Isn’t that GREAT!
9772 2018-01-05 18:45:53 Why did my dad think I was old enough to go get my own oil changed. I am not old enough

9774 2018-01-05 18:45:37 We should definitely increase the deficit, take away marijuana revenues, build a $1.8b wall, fight with Korea, drill for unneeded oil in costal waters, and spend money investigating the Clintons.  Yeah, that's what we should do.

9776 2018-01-05 18:45:19 Of all the “natural hair” products that I’ve bought nothing works better than shea butter, coconut oil, and some conditioner
9777 2018-01-05 18:45:17 We will NEVER, I repeat NEVER see any major or small time company drilling for oil off the Oregon, Washington or Cali coast. Im a proud Oregonian and WW 3 will break out before this state ever allows oil exploration anywhere near our coastline!
9778 2018-01-05 18:45:15 .@craigmelvin @hughhewitt MENTION the fact that all the safeguards implemented after Deep Water Horizon by Obama were deleted.  ALSO, that Trump removed the 9 cent tax per barrel of oil meant to cover oil spill costs!  #TrumpIsKILLINGTheEarth
9779 2018-01-05 18:45:13 That’s nice. Why did you vote for all the oil company giveaways in the tax bill?
9780 2018-01-05 18:45:10 We want their oil and resources. Don’t bullshit us Ted, we’re trying to do the SAME thing we’ve been trying to do over there for decades.
9781 2018-01-05 18:44:54 It really is, I was telling a friend the other day that I was playing the new DOOM and Skyrim WHILE I was getting my oil changed at the dealership. Like, how crazy is that?
9782 2018-01-05 18:44:54 Shame on you for caring more about profits for oil companies than the environment and natural beauty of Alaska. Your short-term thinking will result in long-term, negative consequences for Alaska
9783 2018-01-05 18:44:29 @FoxNews corrupt Trump is trying 2pay off special interest oil companies in hopes that he’ll make money when he gets out of office it’s corrupt and it hurts R environment &R kids future all 4 money these people should not be in office they are so corrupt they’ll sell their soul
9784 2018-01-05 18:44:26 Lol like small stuff. Change my tyre, change oil, change wipe blade etc
9785 2018-01-05 18:44:23 And olive oil stains garments!  Blast, have you ever tried to get an olive oil stain out of a black wool?  Impossible!
9786 2018-01-05 18:44:18 Why would anyone allow off shore drilling along every coast? Why wouldn’t you continue to explore wind and solar energy. Trump supporting big oil companies.
9787 2018-01-05 18:44:18 It comes with zero risk because he won’t play. Besides everyone still loves oil, Roman wipes his arse with £15m.

9792 2018-01-05 18:44:00 Trump kills safety on oil rigs, and now wants to drill in costal waters, oil companies can’t be trusted ! Dump this idea
9793 2018-01-05 18:43:58 @HughHewittShow is just as much a madman as his lover @realDonaldTrump This oil drilling U.S. dominance is insanity.

9795 2018-01-05 18:43:55 You don't want to read too much into Montoya's small sample size but lots into LB's on a team playing just as poorly.  Rob, I follow you because I respect your opinion, and agree the Oil might be moving on from LB, but I disagree on what it means and could be a mistake.
9796 2018-01-05 18:43:53 Gruden definitely gonna be burning that midnight oil in year 8 of that thing

9798 2018-01-05 18:43:46 Al "the Snake Oil Salesman" Gore is still, unbelievably, spouting this fascist-inspired drivel!
9799 2018-01-05 18:43:42 Also, the anti-abuse provision Congress added (the so-called "Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income" tax) strangely EXEMPTS foreign oil & gas income, letting companies easily shift oil income offshore. Why hasn't there been more coverage about the huge oil co loopholes in the bill?

9813 2018-01-05 18:42:23 If Trump feels massive off shore oil drilling (Calif) is OK, then we should do same off coast of Florida or Texas gulf. Donald won't mind seeing massive oil drilling facilities off shore at Mar-a-Lago? Or is Calif. drilling just the usual Trump revenge agnst a Dem. state?
9814 2018-01-05 18:42:23 took my car to get an oil hangeand few diagnostic tests at 11 it’s going on 2

A true NIMBY
9836 2018-01-05 18:40:46 do the offshore rigs bring in more oil ? Or do it  cheaper ?

9841 2018-01-05 18:40:27 How about NOT turning our coastlines into oil fields? College being unreachable for the masses? NO Net Neutrality? Oh, and that Nuclear War thing ?  You're AAAaaaalmost too late!  Please keep fighting!

9843 2018-01-05 18:40:25 What is amazing about the plutocrats in the oil industry who destroy the habitability of the planet for their temporary gain is that it will doom their progeny as well, yet they don't care.

They're too accustomed to the quarterly profit system to care about the future I suppose?

9847 2018-01-05 18:40:19 Thoughts on oil, we could see $100 a barrel bc it doesn’t sound very probable and well humans will be humans
9848 2018-01-05 18:40:13 @RoyBlunt @clairecmc I am appalled at plans  by @realDonaldTrump to open coastal lands to oil drilling. This threatens the health of these communities & moves us in the wrong direction in regard to climate change. Pls cosponsor S.1996, the Environmental Justice Act,to stop this.

9850 2018-01-05 18:40:08 It's no secret I love a bit of stats. So here's an interesting fact from the latest @CAT_Mag  IF a third of the global parc becomes electric, demand for oil will fall by 3.5 million barrels, A DAY.  #wow #stats #lubricant #fuel #EV
9851 2018-01-05 18:40:03 And you know what budgeting with over $100 a barrel of oil extraction tax versus hovering around $70 a barrel in reality gets you?
9852 2018-01-05 18:40:00 Ooo I’ve never actually used the oil before! That sounds good!
9853 2018-01-05 18:39:51 Also, they don't say how much of California's oil is imported. If it's 52% of 10%, then it's not much.
9854 2018-01-05 18:39:49 St what cost to states, and how much of that oil will go to CHINA??

9855 2018-01-05 18:39:47 Eucalyptus:
Its active compound, Cineole, is an effective decongestant and antiviral, so it is helpful in the treatment of inflammation, colds, and congestion. Put eucalyptus essential oil in a diffuser to make it become airborne and thus relieve respiratory issues.
9856 2018-01-05 18:39:47 #senmarkey  If I was you, I would read the news.  South Korea has been stopping ships of different nations to stop the oil flow.  China agreed to stop oil but they don't own the shipping companies.

9858 2018-01-05 18:39:40 PDP should sponsor the rehabbing and opening of 1-2 non-operating Naija oil refineries. Hire some engineers and workers and get to work. It would look great to the voters before the big 2019 contest.

9862 2018-01-05 18:39:18 I'm quite certain that you know that it is. You just like to troll and laugh in the face of all available evidence. I know why billionaire oil barons do that (greed). I don't know why the common Trumplodyte does. Do you shit where you sleep?

Only interesting aspect: will Trump take down those who thought they could use him as a vehicle (Mercers, Bannon, GOP) with him?
9869 2018-01-05 18:38:05 That's why you voted 'Yes' on #GOPTaxScam for oil drilling, tax cuts for private jet owners, Billionaires, Millionaire's and $2.5 Trillion whole in U.S. budget.

9877 2018-01-05 18:36:43 I take hemp. I guess the better name is CBD oil. I see the perspective of mj smokers esp. since I've dated drug user and dealers. But it has very very bad adverse effects on me, the bio-chemistry. Even to unconscious. I see both sides, but I now caution on the side of safety.
9878 2018-01-05 18:36:35 Oilers fan for the decade of darkness until Las Vegas got a team. It's my hometown. Technically I've been bandwagoning the oil for some time. It was a miserable time.
9879 2018-01-05 18:36:33 with Trump you get all the fracking and now all the coastal oil drilling. very Green!

9881 2018-01-05 18:36:14 You didn't say anything when ISIS was caught sending oil to Turkey...
9882 2018-01-05 18:36:13 If this is true, then he'd hesitate to allow offshore oil extraction, since there is this question of it likely increasing the natural rate and volume of thermal energy transferring into the waters, permanently.

9894 2018-01-05 18:35:13 I knew we used a lot for manufacturing, in fact, isn’t Taft’s oil mostly manufacturing? Batteries are a huge issue for me. They’re terrible to make and dispose of. Tesla’s gigafactories feel more like a step to the side than a step forward.

9898 2018-01-05 18:34:47 If they had done it without the oil money you might have a point

9900 2018-01-05 18:34:44 I know the feeling let's start eating vegetables, fruit and meat only. Drink lots of water and cook with coconut oil/ olive oil. It worked for me....also avoid sugar and starch

9908 2018-01-05 18:34:19 Why would Interior care what you think about oil rigs off the coast of Maine? You showed how little you care about the environment when you voted to let big oil ravage the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
9909 2018-01-05 18:34:14 Trump is an undisputed ass, no question, but Obama was in favor is offshore drilling too. Then the BP oil spill in the Gulf occurred and people saw firsthand the devastating impact.
9910 2018-01-05 18:34:10 So how did the savings go for you on December 31st 2017 JAson? Oh wait, Once again like last year, the price is cheaper today than it was ending last year!! Guess maybe you should focus on the gas spikes from the oil guys before blaming it on a 2.5c/liter carbon levy!
9911 2018-01-05 18:34:06 Usually when API is high it is a sign that the oil has been present subsurface for longer times than others (i.e. it’s been ‘cooked’ longer) or it has formed @ higher temperatures (i.e. production zones are deeper in the oil window).

You’ll never see this administration nor the GOP like Portman call them out on it. Instead we’re getting an “uhh maybe calling someone names on twitter brought peace?” Yeah that’s it

9977 2018-01-05 18:29:20 Transplanted ink stupid inferiority.  Sesame oil, love, throat.

9979 2018-01-05 18:29:09 Of course he is. Oil prices and demand are SO high, and who needs beautiful coasts anyway. Deepwater Horizon was nothing.
9980 2018-01-05 18:29:05 Screw this chump AG. Cal will fight this and oil drilling.
9981 2018-01-05 18:29:04 Okay, if Rump's going to drill on every square inch of shoreline... let the first oil rigs line up at Mar-a-Lago!
9982 2018-01-05 18:28:53 Beware of anyone who treats SGX as anything other than complete snake oil. It's just DRM with some mildly-difficult-to-bypass physical access controls around the key the attacker possesses.
9983 2018-01-05 18:28:51 Umm. I have weird skin and i treat it different ways when it acts different ways.
Oily? Wash in oil free stuff (I use different things), then coconut oil buffed out.
Dry? Exfoliate with @tarabusicreek sweet apple scub, then either coconut oil biffed out, .or moisture surge lotion
9984 2018-01-05 18:28:44 All the GOP sells 2 the USA ppl is new jobs w/ more oil rigs-build &maintain the oil rigs.  Then when there is an oil spill Emergency Responders
Firefighters 
Police
Helicopters
Reporters
Oil Recovery
Animal Rescues
Water Filtering
Beach clean-up
Yeah, new jobs

9985 2018-01-05 18:28:43 It is high time government officials stop feeding us with unnecessary excuses on oil scarcity.
Marketers, hoarders, saboteurs, or whatever name they are called,  I firmly believe they can be dealt with. Do the needful, give us the lasting solution or lose our support. Shikenan!
9986 2018-01-05 18:28:40 YOU are a source of propaganda. How can locally produced energy-wind and sun-possibly cripple American energy and destroy America? What could is continued reliance on oil, while everyone doesn't.
9987 2018-01-05 18:28:28 This nigga at the smoke shop said CBD oil is for the body high and THC is for the head high. People will tell you anything.
9988 2018-01-05 18:28:25 It's a shame an oil producing country like Nigeria can't refine crude oil for her people at full capacity. When are we going to start getting it right? @MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo @NNPCgroup @IbeKachikwu
9989 2018-01-05 18:28:14 His picks did brillantly in 2016 helped in no small part by an oil price rising from $30 to $60. My take, I think he can spot good resources, but is hopless evaluating company management/ finances. Am in HUR, SDX and TRIN.
9990 2018-01-05 18:28:12 Coconut oil is the bomb
9991 2018-01-05 18:27:57 Black seed oil is fucking disgusted tho 
9992 2018-01-05 18:27:48 Everybody keep askin about knowing how to change my oil. No I don’t fuckin  know got dam it.
9993 2018-01-05 18:27:45 DHC extra virgin olive oil moisturizer
9994 2018-01-05 18:27:31 Using yr contacts you could get @Shadow6ix to fly you to an oil rig. Hide out there for 30 days. GG
9995 2018-01-05 18:27:28 WHAT????? WHY THE HELL NOT???? What did WABC do....replace his show with some snake oil salesman?????
9996 2018-01-05 18:27:21 Offshore oil extraction, is possibly one of mankind's most dangerous, reckless, and environmentally damaging undertakings ever done in the history of man.
9997 2018-01-05 18:27:20 Well after their Diet Coke story they had to step up their game
9998 2018-01-05 18:27:17 Look he wants to create oil spills on SC beaches^^^^^ So much for his political career

10000 2018-01-05 18:27:16 I used argan oil to help with my scars! Also coconut oil!
10001 2018-01-05 18:27:08 You can make a lemon juice toner hut dilute it with water. Or you can mix like sugar lemon juice with water and maybe a little coconut oil
10002 2018-01-05 18:26:59 what progress?  China and Russia are drilling. The USA has the opportunity to be a exporter of oil! It means cheap energy, jobs and paying off the US debt
10003 2018-01-05 18:26:50 Oil prices retreated from its highest closing price in three years as expanding inventories of gasoline and diesel in the world’s biggest economy tempered enthusiasm about shrinking crude supplies.
10004 2018-01-05 18:26:39 You sold weapons (changed for oil) to a country rulled by crazy fanatics as yours.
10005 2018-01-05 18:26:28 Brian Reynolds If you wave at me again I'll have you boiled in camel oil!!!!
10006 2018-01-05 18:26:15 gotcha, coconut oil is so good but I too don't want to smell like coconut all of the time (and some friends are allergic)
10007 2018-01-05 18:26:07 Baker Hugues:  Total -5 to 924, Oil -5 to 742 Gas 0 to 182

10008 2018-01-05 18:25:49 Imo, anything that's fried should be for lunch or dinner, not dessert, because oil does not match well with sweetness and sugar
10009 2018-01-05 18:25:49 It's so stupid. The whole thing happened because they figured out they could make fuel out of it, but oil was bigger money. 
10010 2018-01-05 18:25:45 Hey Cali Oil thanks for the follow!
10011 2018-01-05 18:25:41 Acabo de hacer un smoothie de piña con coconut oil. Lo mejor que se me ha ocurrido en el día csm

10013 2018-01-05 18:25:37 can my mom stop using so much butter n oil when she cooks!!!!! thats fucking annoying and useless most of the time pls stOp now!!!!!!!
10014 2018-01-05 18:25:36 My head teacher gave me cod liver oil because she thought I had ADHD. Turns out I was BPD...
10015 2018-01-05 18:25:34 Deep breaths of lavender essential oil to help maybe while catching your breath?
10016 2018-01-05 18:25:24 My hot dogs caught on fire and almost burned my kitchen down, after sitting them in the olive oil. I almost singed my eyebrows off! Now my husband is pissed off that I almost killed myself over cooking hot dogs, and won't ever let me do this method again.
10017 2018-01-05 18:25:22 Omg !!! Guess who is enjoy these frigid temperatures  hydro union gas oil propane and furnace companies. They’re seeing $$ signs we are seeing empty bank accounts 
10018 2018-01-05 18:25:22 Or making America great again - it’s a disaster in the making - if the oil companies are not held responsible do we think their due diligence will go up or down..?
10019 2018-01-05 18:25:22 Try clove oil or simply brush with salt & mustard oil.
10020 2018-01-05 18:25:19 I always have gas lol but I really do need a oil change and im getting one tomorrow but thats not stopping me from driving 
10021 2018-01-05 18:25:13 Who could resist buying this one with Kerrie covered in oil!!
