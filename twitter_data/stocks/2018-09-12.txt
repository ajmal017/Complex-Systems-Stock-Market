44 2018-09-12 23:46:06 no one with any training would ever use bump stocks.

It is one of those things that people who know nothing about guns hate. People who know nothing about training want one.

To bad Vegas shooter was a progressive violent racist. Goes against liberal narratives.

47 2018-09-12 23:45:36 Don’t invest in stocks that’s going down.
48 2018-09-12 23:45:16 Same here! This is what liberalism gets you.  This is a dog and pony show.  They list 5 companies four of which are owned by #BigTobacco, then say 60 days or else!! Then ole #FDA Scotty regulates #smallbusinessowners while big tobacco stocks surged.

50 2018-09-12 23:44:31 Got to love these value manager that say they don't believe in market timing but are holding 35% cash because they think stocks are expensive. 

Guess what.. you are engaging in market timing by suggesting you know when it's a good time to be in cash.
51 2018-09-12 23:43:50 In my estimation, growth is more risky and I assume a few growth stocks lift the overall performance of group - this guy prefers mid cap and larger with positive FA and TA

56 2018-09-12 23:35:21 So... your administration’s criminality should be overlooked because stocks are up and unemployment is low? That’s not how laws work, Don.
57 2018-09-12 23:35:04 Maybe I’m naive, but I think it’s more than doable. Maybe you’d want to deploy more than 100k. I guess it’s largely dependant on the markets your dealing with. But I imagine there are a TON of stocks that fluctuate 0.5% numerous times a day up and down. Interest piqued!
58 2018-09-12 23:34:41 What about Amazon? I remember my friends was so scare to order online and I use to order from Amazon all the time, at the time the stocks was soo cheap but there is a company that will make me big bucks
59 2018-09-12 23:34:34 That one Southpark episode where they have a headless chicken run around to decide stocks. Someone remake that but with "What's Killing Comics" seriously the number of things I've been told will kill comics astounds.
60 2018-09-12 23:34:06 @symmyterykid598 You know what's really symmetrical and round? Pumpkins! Buy pumpkin stocks today!
61 2018-09-12 23:33:19 Excuse me but I think I have a solution to your problem. Why not put aside your differences and join forces in order to invest in the opportunity of a lifetime! Invest in Pumpkin stocks! With a low risk and medium return index fund, you can retire on the dividends by 40!
62 2018-09-12 23:32:21 They drafted McCartin last year and actually have a decent depth of talls in their stocks. But their arms are tied anyway as they are committed to taking Blakey with an academy selection

The trade being floated is pick 4 for Hannebery and Pick 13. Which values him at around 22.
63 2018-09-12 23:31:53 There are plenty of $LG $LG.V holders waiting for you to buy so that they can bail out. New blood always needed so that the previous believers can get out. Always the way with #Lenigas stocks. Musical chairs while the promoter ramps for the next dilution.
64 2018-09-12 23:30:14 My analysis of this data focused on the average percent decline of USDA's US soybean ending stocks guesses over the 17-month guessing period. I don't have the numbers in front of me but a 60% decline from high comes to mind. #USDAIsClueless

70 2018-09-12 23:27:53 Because it has done more to combat smoking than any other NRT or tax ever. Why do you think tobacco stocks gained $20billion in value today upon the FDAs announcement of cracking down on e-cigs?

85 2018-09-12 23:17:18 The quality UK stocks look good value to me: CCO & HMN. I also like Investec Aus Prop Fund (IAP). I hold them all plus a bit of higher risk Stenprop (STP). But we must accept that higher rates & a hard Brexit could knock them down further.
86 2018-09-12 23:16:52 Penny stocks are great to move. Weed stock is going up and up

106 2018-09-12 23:05:55 Hi David. Yes and yes. Unfortunately seems a near certainty that rates will go up longer term. It will affect all prop stocks. Nonetheless, I hold some quality counters thru the cycle. At 9% yield for GRT we are perhaps not that far from a bottom in price. But risk remains.
107 2018-09-12 23:05:44 @EddyElfenbein @CNNMoney move the 4% into penny stocks.

110 2018-09-12 23:02:53 Part of the confirmation criteria is that stocks making new 52w highs don't exceed twice those making new lows. With many of these, most recently yesterday I believe, New Lows exceeded New Highs. It's not perfect (nothing is), but it signals dramatically reduced participation.

114 2018-09-12 23:00:38 Wow. You are such a sheep that you can't even spell. I wonder how you even bought those stocks...
115 2018-09-12 23:00:09 Though institutional investors usually make a market out of equities, and are instrumental in determining the "value" of publicly traded stocks, they've mostly kept to the sidelines with regard to digital currencies since they're an unregulated asset.
116 2018-09-12 22:58:54 And I’ve been in 3 stocks on aim for at least 3 years. Traders may trade but nothing better than buying potential and waiting, trading generally loses money unless you have the time and are full time, each to there own

121 2018-09-12 22:51:01 3/ Ken, from my experience it is ALWAYS worth starting in the stock market. May be a rocky road initially, but learning about stocks & ETFs will empower you for life. R50k is a fine amount and perfectly sufficient to purchase say, 2 stocks without pushing the brokerage too high.
122 2018-09-12 22:50:57 I want to start learning more about stocks I need some guidance on that

133 2018-09-12 22:42:51 Timing in life is everything.  But far too many people get discouraged and sell at the bottom.  Few would have expected the FED’s super liquidity push to last so long. It’s that liquidity which flowed into stocks and luxury real estate that will cause problems as it is withdrawn

137 2018-09-12 22:38:57 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
138 2018-09-12 22:36:53 Yes. We’re all working harder &  faster for less while your rich donors & corporations rake in profits,buy back stocks w/the tax scam you made them the beneficiaries of while we can’t afford healthcare, rent or groceries because of anemic or  non existent wage growth. Fuck off
139 2018-09-12 22:36:52 The Real Prob is that we have some few Stocks on Nasdaq,CGC,CRON,IGC and TLRY is the only ones that just listed in USA and next is that’s a Lowfloater! Definitely they have to Dilute,that’s the only step and IMO it will be coming soon

149 2018-09-12 22:25:49 $DFFN hit ma 200 today on big volume ...looking for break of ma 200....this big volume today is not for nothing imo
150 2018-09-12 22:25:21 I hate when people use another stocks tag to pump their shit.  If I cared about your stock that much I’d be looking it up my damn self.
151 2018-09-12 22:25:15 Always remember that due to the relatively small market cap + community compared to blue-chip stocks, $crypto sentiment can change within the day if not the hour.

If you sold to watch from the sidelines, don't snooze.
152 2018-09-12 22:23:01 Try not to be insulting. It doesn't really serve any purpose in debate and is just poor rhetorical strategy. You should know that, since words matter. 

There is nothing parroty about it. The GDP, unemployment, stocks, labor participation rate, etc. are all at record levels.
153 2018-09-12 22:22:55 Enhorabuena!
154 2018-09-12 22:22:55 NIKE stocks are currently .46 and climbing.  Yet another rousing success for Cantservative boycotts.  We now add it to Starbucks, Target and Hamilton.

156 2018-09-12 22:22:16 ColourPOP, wet n wild et plus encore en font de très bon a des prix bas, elle arrive après la guerre. Il n'y a que les fans pour épuiser les stocks, quelqu un de plus réfléchit n irai pas investir un centime dans une marque qui vient de débarquer 
157 2018-09-12 22:21:32 I'm very deep almost2x your level after pouring in profits made from other weed stocks past few weeks 

if they do have a deal they're doing a good job keeping it hush
158 2018-09-12 22:21:17 I'm so ready for 3 stocks, man. It is going to be amazing to only be responsible of a third of my own deaths, instead of half.

162 2018-09-12 22:19:59 I had a question about this.  Isn't the headline misleading?  The study reveals 1/5 of millennials than  have less than expected in stocks, but also that "the typical millennial household takes on substantial equity risk"

173 2018-09-12 22:10:33  Found these #stocks that made all-time highs: $MTCH, $DVMT, $GDDY, $ADBE, $CRM, $GWRE, $FTNT
174 2018-09-12 22:10:26 Also there were warnings put out by regs last week so extreme caution is Warranted. Notwithstanding this issue & sector have been blistering and in very strong hands, it is symptomatic of market tops where stocks like this go berserk, not always, but based on past experiences...?
175 2018-09-12 22:10:24 You will have seen that #tobacco stocks leapt on the news. When you say there’s more to be done, do you mean you think you can drive tobacco stocks even higher??

180 2018-09-12 22:08:41 Stocks reach higher with gains in consumer-staple and trade sectors offsetting declines in financial and technology
181 2018-09-12 22:05:56 FTSE250 turned up nicely like FTSE100 - despite the Brexit and September etc fears the Charts look like UK Stocks want to rise. Europe similar.
182 2018-09-12 22:05:18 $AKTX $MACK $IMUC my sleep "junk" stocks.. cant wait to reload them and get a good avg down... combo profit folks
183 2018-09-12 22:04:55 The Stocks are the same.  Most of the stocks are flat or down after inflation and but a minority of great performers give the Index a positive return.

That's the benefit of Indexing to the unsophisticated or busy Investor.
184 2018-09-12 22:04:47 Pues como esté en sus manos van a agotar las empresas 'de confianza' del Ayto. de @Madrid todos los stocks de motosierras.

188 2018-09-12 22:03:02 Hopium #crypto Update: This is potentially ‘94-‘95 all over again.
Retail investors got shaken out of the biggest bull run in history. They sold all of their dot com stocks when the market dropped 80-90%.
189 2018-09-12 22:02:42 Ridiculous health and safety. No danger clearing food stocks.
190 2018-09-12 22:02:41 Check $TTD , 2 consecutives ER +40% . From 45-150$ in just 4 months . Nobody expected . Lockup is near in $PVTL , don’t want to hold big loses in my biggest position , at least I will sell a 20-30-40% of the position . So much cost of opportunity in other stocks .
191 2018-09-12 22:02:09 @jimcramer Pot stocks Cramer! They are killing it. You think this is a 18-24 month play? Should I be long? #MadMoney
192 2018-09-12 22:02:07 Threw half my money in stocks today 
193 2018-09-12 22:02:03 Man it really makes no sense how these weed stocks are soaring so quick n so fast
194 2018-09-12 22:01:03 If the Fed buys stocks it will delay the day of reckoning and make very explicit how the world economy now works.
195 2018-09-12 22:00:40 As the anniversary of the shooting in Vegas approaches, Congress has finally stood up to the NRA & done
absolutely nothing.
Nothing has changed, federally, to stop the next one. Bump stocks are still legal
40 round magazines still legal
Background checks can still be bypassed
196 2018-09-12 22:00:24 $TLRY was trading 109.50 when @CNBCFastMoney teased about @timseymour turning bearish.  Stock now under 106.  Influence of CNBC on certain stocks is incredible.
197 2018-09-12 22:00:22 And parents take a lot longer setting up the catch and release argument. So now the can all stay together
198 2018-09-12 21:59:38 CBOT Dec wht down A$8.06/t after USDA lifted opening wht stocks, & prodn estimates for Russia and India, more than offsetting declines for Canada & Aust. Ending stocks lifted by 2.33 mill t when trade had expected a fall. Importers holding big stocks as well.
199 2018-09-12 21:59:17 Win Nov canola down A$3.29/t & EU rape down A$9.44. Caught by rising Malaysian palm oil stocks after poor monthly exports. Weakest August data in 10 yrs. Decline despite lift in US soybns after a USDA Report. Rising A$ hasn’t helped.
200 2018-09-12 21:58:56 The POTUS can't be in the right mind when one hurts there own portfolio. Just did A WIKI On his businesses and found what appears to be what he's invested in. All of those stocks are being hurt by his tariffs
201 2018-09-12 21:57:56 @CNBCFastMoney try not to destroy the profits some little investors have made by bashing a stocks great move please. All of us dont get paid 6 figures to talk on TV. Softer gentler approach to high flyers, would have saved the tech wreck
202 2018-09-12 21:57:19 CBOT Dec wht down A$8.06/t after USDA lifted opening wht stocks, & prodn estimates for Russia and India, more than offsetting declines for Canada & Aust. Ending stocks lifted by 2.33 mill t when trade had expected a fall. Importers holding big stocks as well.
203 2018-09-12 21:56:27 Even if you didn't know the pot stocks were hot you can tell because it's all the business tv talks about this week.
204 2018-09-12 21:56:20 @quakes99 
I have got rid of some gold stocks and will  invest in Uranium, with the strong dollar I can't see how gold and silver can breakout anytime soon. next year at the earliest. My reasoning is to enjoy the uranium ride and then move into G&S
kind regards
205 2018-09-12 21:55:45 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
206 2018-09-12 21:55:29 Thanks so much for coming, and the support xx
207 2018-09-12 21:55:23 You need to get off my time line. You seem to work here on some mysterious drift for the poor GOP that has such a bad rep. 
At that time the Insurance lobby threatened to lay down 3m people and the stocks were at stake as well. THIS was the reason to stop single payer.

212 2018-09-12 21:51:17 Theres no retiring at 50 w/o owning some form of appreciating asset which would require investing now. Stocks are the easiest to get into

I hope you reach your goals & if you do, write a book on it bc doing so would disrupt the entire retirement/financial planning establishment.
213 2018-09-12 21:50:35 nah bro.. crypto is dead.. I’m going balls deep in cannabis stocks.. going to be even bigger than crypto at its peak.. this is the time to buy before it really starts taking off.. currently invested in ACBFF, TLRY, and GWPH

246 2018-09-12 21:32:43 TBF, it just doesn't make sense to buy stocks at ATH. Wait 1-3 years for the market to correct 40% and then load up.

This boom may not last forever, try NOT TO CHASE any runner, that is where you end up holding a bag. 

I tweeted about $BEER.V $BLIS $PURE and $KBEV 

All of them already ran quite a bit. Don't chase

253 2018-09-12 21:28:44 I'm not sure, but if he stocks other brands of the same items, that should solve the problem.  Or am I missing something?  I think these NFLers have every right to protest, but they should do it at rallies where they can't disrespect our flag, anthem, and nation.

261 2018-09-12 21:25:30 So you want to take e-cigarettes of the market but cigarettes can stay? It’s no wonder the big tobacco stocks jumped today with this announcement.

287 2018-09-12 21:10:09 Stocks seem to be going sideways recently.  Setting up a range over the last couple of weeks. TREND REMAINS UP, NO HEDGES. Easy peasy. Just moving up the sell stops on the hedges and enjoying the ride!

-Amazon Also Pays above than minimum Wage.

292 2018-09-12 21:09:19 So much FUD over RISE Settlement. I'm smiling thinking the last thing held over their heads is settled.  I can only see XRP rising in value from here on out.  AMD is killing it. Energous Corp presents great Buy.  My Crypto penny stocks are slaying it. WTDN? Sell AMD or Hold AMD?
293 2018-09-12 21:09:02 Just throwing two stocks that could make sense out there. I agree the $NKTR deal makes a deal likely off the table. Could also be $INCY for some reason, but seems out of their reach in terms of a cash-only deal, in which case why file for an offering...
294 2018-09-12 21:07:48 Hurry while stocks still last. By the time you get here, you might need US$3K +
295 2018-09-12 21:07:27 Thanks which Index if you don’t mind. Iv slowly been trading my wins into an index as it’s easier to manage when things drop. Have a stop loss on it actually (not on any other stocks). Blowing past 200k today so my strategy / game plan needs an upgrade.
296 2018-09-12 21:07:26 Omg, 15 vs 20. Incinerate their stocks! 
297 2018-09-12 21:06:20 If not the iPhone, buy those stocks!
298 2018-09-12 21:05:35 Almost, but that's not the borrowing  means.

The borrowing you mean is increasing the federal budget deficit by spending into infrastructure, or buying stocks of companies (like the previous bailout). GOP always votes against latter.

"Quality at a fair price" has been conflated to mean "quality at any price." In reality, "quality at a bargain price," for Buffett, reigns supreme.

322 2018-09-12 20:56:42 The problem is that France unilaterally set laws for its own fishermen to reduce fishing and conserve stocks. They then see the British come in (legally) and take the replenishing stocks. It wouldn’t happen if zbritsin was part of Europe!

352 2018-09-12 20:37:38 I find stocks in motion harder to reason about, trying to guess who knows what, and whether they've acted/reacted on it yet.
353 2018-09-12 20:36:29 It’s clearly that you play dumb to the truth. You admit bits and pieces of it in your tweets. You know nobody plans to take the guns/bump stocks already out there. So why ask that? Because fear mongering and propaganda spreading that’s why. I see right through your bs.
354 2018-09-12 20:35:53 This is black box ops. The first check out shows the stocks jumping in private prison and support services. Wealthy enslaving playing Eugenics all the while in our face. I'm observing the raging fire and  destruction of our lives. Keep screaming it illuminates the cause. Thx
355 2018-09-12 20:35:38 In my Supply Chain Management years as a consultant we played the Beer Game. It showed how a single demand disruption completely made the stocks go totally out of control. How does anybody, accurately enough, assess what stock levels will suffice on this massive scale?!

357 2018-09-12 20:33:46 World stocks ex Asia flat to higher: Europe +.5%; US +.04%. US investors paused to consider toll trade issues could take on the market versus the effect of a strong economy. Anyone's guess what the results of trade discussions will be. One thing known is they will affect market.
358 2018-09-12 20:31:40 Market is pricing stocks based on future expectation. In this case potential loss of vision and deteriorating business is the reason JD sold off. A lot of fears baked in already it seems. JD business still seems to progress as far as I can see from several sources.

397 2018-09-12 20:16:12 @AskRobinhood I'm not able to buy stocks because of a transfer reversed, the Robinhood app asked me to send pictures of my ID and I did but I'm still not able to trade on Robinhood, this was last week. Help!
398 2018-09-12 20:15:15 Cannabis stocks FTW.  I´ll come back to crypto end of next month if i see this bottoming out.  For the time being pot ftw.  This could lead to a very nasty capitulation ATM.

403 2018-09-12 20:13:40 Anybody invest in stocks on my tl? 
404 2018-09-12 20:13:37 When $crypto is like this, I’m glad I still trade #stocks too. I tweeted about $ARWR from under $10, went up 100% and said I’d still hold. Now it broke $20 and I’m over 160% gains. Still holding, this relatively unknown #biotech is just getting started!
405 2018-09-12 20:13:01 So based on my Apple Stocks falling the new IPhones are no good??
406 2018-09-12 20:12:40 Whole point on my tweet was that you don't need to invest on the new phone every year and invest in something productive but whatever just keep making my stocks go up
407 2018-09-12 20:12:15 Pour sûr, mais je pensais pas qu'il le dégageait forcément, (bon, y'a encore des stocks.. et les magasins vont se faire un plaisir des les refourguer)

420 2018-09-12 20:03:44 Options? Not too long, most of my positions are in stocks for long haul. Figure I free up 15-20 percent to play with options since robinhood offers free options trades.

430 2018-09-12 20:00:07 What's wrong is either notion that somehow

* buying stock actively helps a company, who already sold the equity and gathered the proceeds during the IPO

* shorting stocks or buying puts can hurt company operations or profitability.

Neither puts nor shorting hurts a company.

494 2018-09-12 19:30:20 You exercise your puts at the price in your contract, and then you are short the stock and start paying the cost of carrying the short position (in suspended stocks the borrow is always tight) and you are stuck until it starts trading again.  $WINS was a recent example, last year

528 2018-09-12 19:15:31 This is a good story, but it needs further mention of the habitat destruction of the sea floor due to contamination by fish farms. Every time #orcas are given news coverage, the effect of #fishfarms on #wildsalmon stocks should automatically be included in the discussion. #bcpoli

531 2018-09-12 19:14:34 Sold all my funds today, man's gone bearish. Don't see a recession but bear market indicators are higher than in 1969 and American stocks look sooo overvalued. Something's going to give. Sell now, go non-cyclical and buy in after the drop; that will come
532 2018-09-12 19:14:29 The volatility in stocks on my watch list is insane right now. AMD up another 6% today on no news whatsoever. SNAP down 7%. These are not normal daily moves yet VIX which is supposed to be a measure of volatility remains crushed. #crazymarkets

663 2018-09-12 18:24:16 You should extend that list , I think most people will be shocked on how bad most shares ons Jse has done , for one you can add MTN and some other property stocks also , also mediclinic and etc etc
664 2018-09-12 18:24:14 I’m about to sell these stocks 
665 2018-09-12 18:23:37 Thanks for sharing WD as it’s been a very tough year and the past couple of months have been difficult. I would add to your note to keep reappraising the case on your stocks and if the facts have not changed, then I am holding. No sense incurring frictional trading costs.
666 2018-09-12 18:23:01 Yup!! But maybe on October since I have an upcoming convention to prepare for and the stocks I ordered wouldn't be enough to open shop at the moment ;u; I'll definitely announce it when once it's available though!

670 2018-09-12 18:21:32 Inventories are building across the SOX components and demand has softened. Excess capacity is evident and in some areas is looks like fiber-optics in 2001. When the market will realize these stocks are grossly overvalued is anyone's guess.
671 2018-09-12 18:21:17 Good stuff.  Could be an argument that these factors capture market sentiment as well.

Would love to see how skew + value combine to see if you can filter out stocks that are not offering a significant risk premium.
672 2018-09-12 18:20:22 What a THUG this BILLY BAD ASS IS! The vets who fought/died didn’t deserve this! A warped low life slug that couldn’t hold their water needs to be put in stocks in the town square holding his manhood for all to wiz on!!!

674 2018-09-12 18:17:43 Are u sure what u are b saying. Who are these borrowers ,on what basis did the ex n the directors of ftil lend investor money. You stood counter gaurantee for the investors. So the directors are responsible for returning the money to investors. Else let them sell the stocks ??

1. 3 inter related stocks will touch sky in near term. #GRAPHITE, #HEG, #RainIndustries: Needle coke ban lift
2. Next segment : Steel
Due from long. #JSW promoter buying back
3. Laurus:  moment expected. Promoters buying aggressively

685 2018-09-12 18:14:20 They're making money now by pumping up their stocks with buybacks, and their CEOs pocketing hundreds of times the average worker's pay.

712 2018-09-12 18:02:25 We are comparing one security to $MSFT, not two other stocks. Even so, you've only done calculations, not told us anything explicitly about the relative liquidity of these two auto companies.
713 2018-09-12 18:02:01 $AAPL currently trading at $221.84 (-2.01) for the day.  I'm taking in a few highlights for the new #iPhone and am interested to see what the price is for new phones.  Anything above $1K is pure profit and would drive the #stock price higher.  #AppleEvent #stocks #Innovations

739 2018-09-12 17:48:06 the definition of speculation is “investment in stocks, property, or other ventures in the hope of gain but with the risk of loss.” so if you ask me i say there is little difference between the two.

750 2018-09-12 17:44:55 absolutely.  liquidity is your friend (more liquidity in these equities).

801 2018-09-12 17:28:07 Obama’s is over, into Trump. Tax cuts done affect you if you’re not super rich, and have a 10year shadow date. Wages are less than what they were in the 60’s. And people can’t see doctors for more than 5 min due to insurance brothels inoculating people, its bigger than stocks.

811 2018-09-12 17:22:53 If you are strictly trading/investing in crypto, I recommend that you venture off into other industries.

The money hasn’t been made in crypto this year, it’s been made in the stock market.

I am definite that Crypto will have its time again, but likely not while stocks are on 
812 2018-09-12 17:21:08 So right now the goal for most people is to take as much money as possible, btc or usd. Convenience (Stable coins) will win for now, but not forever. I imagine many day traders will be switching to cannabis stocks soon.  bye bye!

828 2018-09-12 17:15:15 Hi @ArlanFF101. Don't you think it's strange that world ending stocks has decreased from 227.83 mmt to a projection of 157.03 from 2016/17 to 2018/19. That's 70 million tons less and yet cbot corn is trading at almost identical levels it was 2 years ago.

Also, who guessed that Apple would extoll the virtues of putting Stocks on the Apple Watch?

865 2018-09-12 17:05:59 Exactly, that is what Trump and his cheerleaders don’t understand. When they brag about the stock market, they don’t get that 1/2 the country doesn’t own stocks or have any retirement savings at all.

900 2018-09-12 16:52:30 Corn stocks only rise to 1.774 billion bushels.  Soybean stocks rise to 845 million bushels. USDA pegs the corn crop at 181.3 bushels per acre and soybeans at 52.8 bpa. World corn stocks rise to 157.03 mmt on the bigger U.S. crop. World soybean stocks up to 108.26 mmt
901 2018-09-12 16:52:06 It's for long-term shorts who are "over stocks" after all their losses.  They're throwing in the towel and buying random growth rubbish.
902 2018-09-12 16:51:27 So world corn ending stocks has fallen from 227.83 mmt in 2016/17 to a projection of 157.03 mmt come 2018/19. Yet report is bearish. Buy the dip people. Easy as pie. We are almost priced the same as in 2016/17 looking @ cbot.

924 2018-09-12 16:39:45 We get it. You’re protecting business over employees. Profits over people. Lies over integrity. Donors before citizens. Country before party. This is why you will be voted out. Average Americans don’t earn enough to invest in stocks. So stop using that as your litmus test.
925 2018-09-12 16:39:45 So its nearly time to buy up these cheap stocks?

941 2018-09-12 16:33:37 I think if we're going to be long EM-related stocks, we need to only be in the ones where momentum is in a bullish regime and did not get oversold on these last couple of declines (14-day RSI) $EEM

961 2018-09-12 16:25:50 Long term investors need to invest when there is maximum pessimism in the markets. When u have 1 year horizon, each dip whatever it may be, how downside it goes, right time to grab quality stocks. For now, go for largecap quality stocks. Refer my old tweets for some if them

968 2018-09-12 16:23:00 ~ I know Trump isn't the best president, but we can at least give him some credit. The stocks increased now that he is in office, don't be so cruel. President like Bush already set the precedent that republicans are bad, is that it?

977 2018-09-12 16:21:02 This stock is beyond comprehension, does not make sense. Therefore dangerous. 8000 stocks to trade and everyone talks about this one. Ohhh I have to go open the door for the sheeps.
978 2018-09-12 16:20:50 The worldwide corn stocks 17/18 fall from 194.15 t to 157.03 t for 18/19 and the market classifies this as bearish. One does not have to understand.
979 2018-09-12 16:20:31 My general take on the replacement currency/multipolarity issue is less rule of law, generosity, indispensability etc. etc.,  and more "legacy issues stemming from the currency denomination of existing debt stocks take a long time to resolve"
980 2018-09-12 16:19:24 If Trump hears a China deal is worth a 10% move in the $SPX, he'll hit the bid at the right time- not sure that's necessarily right but is a huge group of stocks that will definitely rip 15-20% fairly quickly
981 2018-09-12 16:19:04 As wages and income rises, stocks create wealthy retirement accounts, business begins offering better pay and benefits to more qualified people, the Left campaigns on doom and gloom. That’s all the DNC has ever delivered. #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA #TrumpTrain

987 2018-09-12 16:15:45 I'm less sophisticated on this.  Does it basically mean that borrowing interest rates and inflation will go up too?  Which means less buying and possible down turn?  This subtly depressed stocks too, since interest investments are better?

Unless we see a meaningful move in data / US stocks plunge ~20% Fed will raise like clockwork. Rates are still well below neutral and fin conditions are loose..
1004 2018-09-12 16:11:33 let's say the price of a t-shirt goes from $9.99 to 11.99, so you won't buy them as often. Less waste. Cheaper prices creates more waste but larger consumption witch stocks like off course.

1046 2018-09-12 16:03:21 I agree with human behaviour during parabolic rise, always the same, fomo kicks inn. But a stocks recovery is bound to its business and fundamental data, btc dump is just a pullback to specific MA level and consolidation, preparing for next boost. Above 100k within 5 years

1074 2018-09-12 15:56:02 Trade Talks - Mnuchin has been overruled by Trump before. With him in charge instead of Trump and given that the last trade talks were useless, I have little faith that this is nothing more than window dressing, a delay tactic for time to keep stocks afloat ahead of the Midterms.

1090 2018-09-12 15:49:00 It's a stock that recently came from $1s so people will take profit here and there.  These types of stocks generally move up over time after initial traders leave.  Plus as more analysts go over the calculations, there'll be more coverage/visibility.
1091 2018-09-12 15:48:55 Doubled down on #twtr #twitter & #Micron #MU on this dip moment. These two stocks are pro growth and won't be down for long.

1562 2018-09-12 13:23:34 There will come a period of time when stocks you have high conviction in drop 40-50-60%. You will question your conviction, your strategy, your process. The market will find your pain point, and this will be your test. Few things test your conviction like falling stock prices.
1563 2018-09-12 13:22:51 Yes cut it......when the street turns its back on chip stocks they do not rebound til the next cycle.  Just look at monthly charts.  I trades MU in the 90’s only to see it tank then rebound hard very hard in 1999 only to make another round trip to the single digits.  AMD sam boat
1564 2018-09-12 13:22:35 Yup, 10-year bull run in stocks coz Fed prints money at will n pours it into the market. I expect Nasdaq to hit $10k next year, but not before a pullback toward $7k possibly this fall. Play thru QQQ. Stock Market is an illusion, but fun to play. Not investment advice, haha.
1565 2018-09-12 13:22:29 @kikopangilinan, surely someone benefitted from the "intentional delay" of importing rice for our buffer stocks. 

What they did not anticipate is the impact; that it will be a full blown crisis, a smack on their face. I agree, GREED and INCOMPETENCE!

1608 2018-09-12 13:02:11 This is HUGE because it is BOND markets, NOT stocks that determine true systemic risk. When a stock market breaks down, investors lose money. When the bond market breaks down... entire countries go broke.

1654 2018-09-12 12:40:40 Stocks go up and down, dumb ass. According to charts we are headed for another huge depression.  That has nothing to do with Democrats, you idiot.
1655 2018-09-12 12:40:25 This means we are on the cusp of a slow recovery, and stocks tend to frontrun such a recovery. So this is the best time to start building positions? The big unknown is How will the new builds affect the utilization- if say only  50% of planned NBs are delivered in next 2 years.

1686 2018-09-12 12:29:34 your policies are failing America but it keeps a prop under stocks which is your true objective. The Fed Res will be blamed once your disastrous and misguided policies find the truth while all of America (not the 1% you cater to) pays the price for your arrogance.
1687 2018-09-12 12:29:21 We are seeing a similar set up.  The market is also starting to pay attention to weed stocks with future and near term growth.

Hi Todd, Thanks for all your great research on Cannabis stocks. I am starting my work on them and was wondering if you have a list of top 5-10 holdings shown somewhere that I could check. Thanks !

1695 2018-09-12 12:25:10 Gundlach also stated at the beginning of 2018 that commodities were the place to be due to extreme value relative to stocks.  Thus far, he has been dead wrong.  He has been wrong on bond yield forecasts as well.  Gundlach is treated as a guru but in reality is just noise.

1700 2018-09-12 12:19:29 Absolutely Miles, it’s something I suggested and called for action on earlier in the summer. Direct intervention from @DefraGovUK to requisition stocks (with appropriate compensation) and redirect them to where needed most wouldn’t be difficult to achieve would it @NFUtweets ?
1701 2018-09-12 12:18:20 The most important point to ponder this morning (from my latest analysis):

"To me, there are only two ways out of this situation. Either foreign stocks play catch UP to U.S. stocks ... or U.S. stocks play catch DOWN to their overseas counterparts."

1713 2018-09-12 12:09:47 Maybe it's so obvious that everybody does it and so it isn't mentioned. Yet in many cases (esp growth stocks) today's prices seem to implicitly assume the company will still be here in 20 years, yet I rarely see an estimate/assessment of longevity on Livewire etc.

1724 2018-09-12 12:04:56 @cspanwj The Republican Party hired a magician to use smoke & mirrors on Tax Hike. Middle-class is going to get screwed more. If we DON'T tax capital gains & Stocks the Rich don't have regular income tax so they pay no taxes. With most deductions eliminated people will loose.
1725 2018-09-12 12:04:04 The place you're standing in the picture prohibits Christians and Jews from praying or reading the bible. How about standing for something that will cost you politically? Caring for the poor is rightly the job of the church, but it will not get you in stocks. Be brave.
1726 2018-09-12 12:03:57 He could have used Moose, he could have used Saladino, he could have let Arcia hit or he could have used Piña and there would have been negatives associated w/ any of them.

1730 2018-09-12 12:02:43 For you to be this adamant you're arguing that Moose had some huge and obvious edge over Piña or any of the other the choices available. He did not. To act like a lefty was the obvious choice against a guy who lefties are hitting .195 against this year is misguided.
1731 2018-09-12 12:02:20 Face value of stocks traded in BSE/NSE

Face value of companies differ from companies to companies. 

This is fooling the investors. 
Hence face value should be made uniform for all companies. 
BSE/NSE  should note this point.

1741 2018-09-12 11:55:21 So you really advise people to buy stocks based on diferent colours of logos instead of company size, state/type of the industry they are in, recent developments etc? That's...interesting. I never said politics are highly technical.

1745 2018-09-12 11:52:33 Would be curious to see a generational breakdown of equity investments.  I suspect millenials are more likely to invest in cannabis stocks, while aging boomers would opt for dividend-paying utility stocks.

So is it better to go with 3IB & 3IIB stocks for trading?

1813 2018-09-12 11:13:47 I have a question.
Where should a beginner who wants to invest in stocks look for guidance and advice, Sir?
1814 2018-09-12 11:13:16 Depends on stocks. Gonna wait til it recovers a bit and hopefully I can ciao without losses soon
1815 2018-09-12 11:10:30 ICO's sound very similar to the day's of penny stocks!. (Have NO value beyond speculation luck - nothing short of pure gambling). Be better off going to a poker casino with added benefit of socialising!.

1835 2018-09-12 10:55:20 Shorting stocks and currencies distort markets. These practices should be banned across the world.

1840 2018-09-12 10:51:35 I’m come from the banks. Most advisors know next to nothing about stocks. Even advisors with $300 million portfolios. They are generally just emotionally intelligent who can deal with people

1842 2018-09-12 10:50:21 I've been calling the Fed's involvement in bailing out NatSec stocks for a while.  They won't be keeping the economy afloat, they will be keeping their spying apparatus afloat.

1867 2018-09-12 10:33:47 You're looking at these cryptos as investments. That right there is your flaw. They are not investments and should not be perceived as such. It is a new economic system. Can your acquired value increase or decrease? Yes. But it's not like stocks. They aren't investments.

I would probably be more comfortable with TFSA for local.

For your global exposure how would u go about it, thats where I sometime get confused coz each has its pros and cons, like I feel US tech stocks are overvalued but maybe thats exactly why u need them

1898 2018-09-12 10:13:20 The country was doing well until the 1% got their tax breaks. Instead of sharing the wealth they brought back their stocks raised their profits, gave a few bonuses then laid off thousands. A new tax is planned just before mid-term elections, one that destroys the U.S. workers.
1899 2018-09-12 10:13:13 I would probably do 60% global ETFs and 40% SA stocks - but only if I can pick the individual stocks. If not (if TFSA) I would do only 30% in CSEW40.

2179 2018-09-12 06:12:13 This event is what got me interested in investing. Started with $2,000 CAD and bought some commodities, then stocks, then crypto from 2013. Last December I bought a new house with profits, fully paid. 

If I was just starting now, I'd go straight to BTC, then ETH, EOS and IOTA.
2180 2018-09-12 06:12:01 Somebody teach @ArianaBonner how to invest in stocks
2181 2018-09-12 06:10:46 They went well thanks - sadly didn't keep a single one of them open though otherwise it would've been a clean sweep. Moved into other stocks instead. A bit silly of me given that it was obvious the balance sheet was a train wreck, but I never claimed to be smart.

2183 2018-09-12 06:08:00 I've been looking at some mineral stocks, particularly penny stocks or OTCs. The strong dollar is driving down precious metals, and some of these mining and exploration companies are looking pretty tempting. Might throw a few bones that way between now and January.

2193 2018-09-12 05:58:53 They are probably hoping for a bump in sales or stocks or some other crap that won't even contribute to their legacy. Itll certainly line the parachutes of those execs.
2194 2018-09-12 05:57:24 They are still falling.The 31% is a figure based on the same 4 days in 2017...when there sales were tanking, as were the stocks. Nike is going down and the press cant save them

2205 2018-09-12 05:49:58 Sir ji you track only 4-5 stocks? One question - how many business you own?
2206 2018-09-12 05:48:16 Ji @karan_pritmani your stock selection for INTRADAY is really awesome. Please guide me how to select INTRADAY stocks .
2207 2018-09-12 05:47:55 To be perfeftly transparent - when I"m flipping #stocks i'm generally looking for 1% - 5% - #swingtrades 3% to 10% - this is not a get rich quick scheme - its a game with rules - same as #crypto #DD #trading My hands are usually around 2k to 5k - usually a ladder buy up, or down
2208 2018-09-12 05:46:32 maybe weed stocks? Would be nice to get a second opinion when to start shorting them. This is a lot like crypto was in 2017.
2209 2018-09-12 05:46:32 I've been doing alright for this bear market, but way different than picking stocks for my long term portfolio

2211 2018-09-12 05:43:31 Too many of us on this app have these lottery ticket fantasies. “Imma buy penny stocks!” “Imma trade forex!” “Imma sell Herbalife!”
And then we wonder why the average networth of Black Twitter is negative.
2212 2018-09-12 05:43:10 Ok Poon,we in business means anything worth is our prize so think it other way when my instruction toward change of guards. I remember childhood advice when many got nostalgic to certain brand stocks &older people said what to do with brand but to do business if u understand deep
2213 2018-09-12 05:43:04 easuries traded heavy for entire U.S. session as concession builds into the curve for this week’s auctions; rally in stocks, led by technology and energy sector, capped Treasuries on the upside along with sharp gains in WTI futures.
2214 2018-09-12 05:42:55 But this always happens when you spot opportunity in strong stocks in a downtrend. They get buy on dips. But continue to expect volatility till market does not settle down with respect to INR trend.
2215 2018-09-12 05:41:02 All these people that sold their @Tesla stocks obviously didn’t watch the whole podcast. @elonmusk was talking exciting things about @Tesla . #EV truly is the #future
2216 2018-09-12 05:39:21 yeah lets get big government to solve our problems instead of using the free market to start out own social media site.
2217 2018-09-12 05:37:17 What broker do you use to get all the locates on penny stocks?
2218 2018-09-12 05:35:58 Also I need to not be scrolling through stocks when I’m bored. I keep wanting to spend money when I shouldn’t 
2219 2018-09-12 05:34:39 Yes the free market making decisions without government interference its called freedom
2220 2018-09-12 05:34:14 For those DM'ing me if things have changed - what I told ETnow ystday "Fall looks corrective..likely to end around 11250 or 11180. No change in my medium term bullish outlook on stocks or Indices. For me to alter my view Nifty has to print 10929"
2221 2018-09-12 05:33:28 @poojat_0211 Pooja u don't reply to my query in stocks social on live TV

2231 2018-09-12 05:22:03 Baby Boomers have stopped looking for work. Wages are down. Benefits are nil. U iona are being busted.

2281 2018-09-12 04:35:25 Risk n Reward... how many stocks do you do continual research on the achieve a living income... jumping from one to another, instead of just holding one or two long term holds dilutes potential profits.

2301 2018-09-12 04:15:25 Definitely something to watch. Inflation needs to drive up the fed funds rate to invert the curve for imminent danger probably will take 12 month’s. Stocks can have some of their best gains during this period.

2315 2018-09-12 04:07:27 That was A good call by Counsell. Piña has been swinging bat well, would have used him in the same situation as well. No offense to Arcia, just the way the ball crumbles.
2316 2018-09-12 04:04:58 5. There were 95 million stock trades just prior to the attacks. Many stocks like JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley etc..were bought on Put, meaning if the stock lost value, they made money, all the while other stocks like Raytheon were bought on call meaning if the stock rose they made
2317 2018-09-12 04:03:56 Added some Tata Elxis to my existing holding in the stock. Will buy more if stocks falls further 10-15% in worst case.

2344 2018-09-12 03:41:01 Sure,yesterday rupee hit new all time low, which causes d panic selling,short term foreign investors FII’s are selling their funds bcoz of the Re fall..if this trend continues for few more sessions then lots of quality stocks will become affordable which will bring d money back
2345 2018-09-12 03:40:45 No the result was expected based on the sample size and data. So yes the decision was bad. It happens but Pina was not even the 4th best option.
2346 2018-09-12 03:40:15 I feel like the only stocks that havent melted up for the last 5 years are fads. Not sure why. We got billion dollar delisted stocks trading, but one trick ponies just get crushed.

2350 2018-09-12 03:38:53 Racists burned Nike gear, declared a boycott, & dumped stocks, cheered when the stock dropped $3 in 1day & the company value down 3%

The stock is higher than it opened at, sales up 31%, and the bigots are burning $ they already spent in an economy that's falling behind quickly
2351 2018-09-12 03:38:48 I sold a portion of my stocks in December, bought some back after the dip in feb. I tend to HODL stocks more than trade because I like holding a part of the earnings so I have some I will never sell. I do make a few plays on retail stocks before holiday season though #nikelove
2352 2018-09-12 03:36:30 One Example is AMD stock not popular stock to many but with little research one could have easily picked it up for 300% gain in mater of 3-4 months.  Took me 1 Month to get rekt in crypto!! Have off set most of what I lost during the same span by profits in stocks with only FA.
2353 2018-09-12 03:36:10 When it falls... it falls like a wall..!! Stay away from stocks for a while, don't try averaging, don't try buying, just keep the money safe.

2357 2018-09-12 03:31:56 It seems more effective to crush demand for oil, which cities can do with a few clever tricks. 

The irony is that even if they successfully divest, by increasing oil demand with their transportation/housing policies, they make oil stocks *more attractive* for other investors!

2359 2018-09-12 03:30:45 ... In my speculative stocks I would go with my prediction of the midterm results. If Blue then I will sell if Red I will buy. Just my opinion. Not being political here, just stating what I would do.
2360 2018-09-12 03:29:24 The market tells us what to buy, we just need to listen.  During the dot-bomb crash "for sale" signs sprouted on every street corner in Palo Alto. In 2009, stocks was a dirty word.  Today, commodities are screaming to be bought and no one wants to touch PMs.  See, what I mean?

2364 2018-09-12 03:27:04 ... around something below the threshold or it is taking too long to get there I would start to consider selling. In my personal opinion the optimal time to purchase micron or any other stocks was in summer 2016.I think the huge rise in prices is due to the Trump economic policy.
2365 2018-09-12 03:26:55 What is said Mam "I but overbought and sell oversold" didn't you hear this?
2366 2018-09-12 03:26:52 Great news for small businesses!  Small biz optimism soared to a record high in August on reports that business is booming given the strong labor market and economy.

2367 2018-09-12 03:26:43 So true ! I can make easier profits with much less TA in stocks.  Done if for 12 years.

2421 2018-09-12 02:45:37 I will grant you unemployment and stocks. BUT GDP, debt,  foreign relations and north korea claims are bullshit. ( I dont care about deportations nor tax cuts, as they are just wrong. )

2432 2018-09-12 02:39:10 Did you see Pina’s numbers in this situation? What was this a “gut” call from CC? That is not giving the team the optimal chance to produce a run. Moose is an All Star player who is not a role player, so I’m completely comfortable with him facing a lefty.

2451 2018-09-12 02:29:47 Also Trump's big "tax reform" had companies buying their own stocks back instead of giving it to the employees as Trump had promised. That caused a false uptick in the market. We still haven't felt the full fallout from Trump's stupidity. When that hits, oh boy it's gonna be bad

2461 2018-09-12 02:13:06 After the DotCom bubble collapsed, it took over 10 yrs for many stocks (eg Amazon, Microsoft) to recover.

I’m not saying that crypto has already had its DotCom moment, but for anyone that thinks it did, remember utility can take a loooong time to catch up to speculation.

2475 2018-09-12 02:04:01 Untrue. Wages haven’t gone up. They used their tax increase to buy their own stocks and enrich themselves, not those who do the work that actually keep their businesses running. If more tax cuts, the working class should strike. We are due respect

2479 2018-09-12 02:02:05 Mr. President, the economy will collapse once we try paying off that tax giveaway. Y’all complained about Obama’s spending then outspent him. The only thing preventing that collapse now is companies are using tax savings to buy back stocks. That’s why the market is flat since Jan

2492 2018-09-12 01:54:16 Was just a few months ago that a friend of mine listened to a Ray Dalio lecture and told me based on that that we absolutely must be in the FANG stocks.
2493 2018-09-12 01:53:45 They're right. Those days are gone. Imagine tech stocks after the dot com bubble burst. No more explosive growth after that.

2495 2018-09-12 01:53:06 Excellent work guys! Now the challenge is to keep it from dropping  significantly when January comes around. NASDAQ too. I know how difficult raising any if not all can be. Fear seems to be the biggest factor lowering these stocks. Good luck.
2496 2018-09-12 01:51:04 A lot of these stocks are "cheap," and holdings could be very different from volume

2498 2018-09-12 01:47:51 @MustStopMurad made a point that is relevant here.  That $90T is the current M3, but there’s plenty of value deployed into stocks/bonds/real estate that would actually be in “cash”, if there were a “cash” that could be trusted to hold value over time.

2501 2018-09-12 01:46:20 No reason 2?lower tx rate 4 corps from 34% to 21%. Plus most corps haven’t given any higher raises than they have in the past. Maybe a few gave 1 time bonuses but mostly used the windfall 2 buyback stocks & increase dividends that didn’t create any jobs—oh, top execs benefited
2502 2018-09-12 01:45:30 My suggestion? learn to be humble Harrison... The person whom you bought the books from and are following on twitter made his money exactly from shorting these stocks. By the way, $AGRX closed down at $0.66. So you would have made 30% had you shorted it at $0.9!!!
2503 2018-09-12 01:44:17 Converted over to stocks in March... Best decision ever. If we ever get another bullrun, I'll start focusing more on cryptos again...

2506 2018-09-12 01:42:28 FYI $RIOT put calls are still looking very profitable short term. Also, $AMZN options.. $BTC is in a tough place which means on some downside we're going to see some nice swings with related stocks such as $RIOT and $OSTK #stockstowatch
2507 2018-09-12 01:42:17 Umm...we trade everyday at @IcemanTrading on 100% technicals (0% fundamentals) and do quite well. A lot of times the stocks we trade we don’t even know what the companies do or if they make a profit or not. They don’t call them “funnymentals” for nothing ;) #ITA
2508 2018-09-12 01:41:41 penny stocks like $NLST & $AGRX created momentum in the low priced junker set-ups. Look to see runners under 1$ tomorrow like possibly $RHE, & $XSPA if they continue this momentum. #trading

Hi!Ekta
Will you be discussing Pharma stocks today
2513 2018-09-12 01:36:37 crypto is only a small part of my “portfolio.” Crypto is by no means in a bull market, it’s actually tanking currently. Investing in stocks, gold, and other things is crucial. Diversifying your holdings and never investing more than you can afford to lose. Basic risk management.
2514 2018-09-12 01:36:27 For me, onions are used as a seasoning. Tantamount in soup stocks, sauces, salsas, curries, etc... but I’m not going out of my way to add them into anything else, sandwiches for instance.  Broccoli still is kween .
2515 2018-09-12 01:36:16 Public humiliation is best bet. Stocks and bonds did wonders at one time.
2516 2018-09-12 01:36:14 $SODE posted nice results on Tuesday surging 34.34% to $0.0579 on volume of 69,600 shares. Company continuing to focus on securing large infrastructure projects.

2521 2018-09-12 01:33:37 All the people who are or will be suffering due to astronomical cost of #VanRe that @bclibers created are on their conscience. Homes should not be treated like penny stocks, what Clark did. That’s what caused their suffering

2543 2018-09-12 01:13:28 Hey. I am not so much into stocks but I am into forex and about to get into binary options. Forex is a much larger market than the stock market and you can see faster ROI. If you will like to learn more about it let me know.
2544 2018-09-12 01:12:42 “Asian stocks are coming off the back of nine day losses, the longest streak of declines in four years.” I still can’t tell whether today’s bounce can sustain.
2545 2018-09-12 01:12:34 It's very intuitive and you can use BTC. I don't use it since I have been trying to trade stocks and FX from fiat to get out of the crypto volatility more but if crypto gets bullish again I might use it more.
2546 2018-09-12 01:12:17 Congratulations Wolf.... 
2547 2018-09-12 01:11:49 It’s like stocks. If you invest in a stock and made 100% back, that stock is better than the one you invested in and made 10% back. The leverage is better. You invested less but made the same amount than the one that invested more.
2548 2018-09-12 01:11:05 Nah, I don’t expect it. It was my mistake to buy far out OTM in first place. $BAC down only 10%, still got Nov. Another $$ lesson with bank stocks.

2557 2018-09-12 01:05:25 @LuckyLuciousP For someone just getting into buying stocks, what’s a decent Marijuana stock to purchase for just starting out? I’m using fidelity to buy and trade btw.
2558 2018-09-12 01:03:41 @gwestr @28delayslater @GerberKawasaki @ValueAnalyst1 @gmbankrupt @vincent13031925 Would you happen to know of companies that can be invested into (in the form of stocks) that mainly market EV charging stations? $tsla is obviously my long, looking for another long to hold.

2564 2018-09-12 00:56:17 I try to not go back and look at research like that... We've written on so many stocks in 2106-2017 that were 1/3 or 1/4 of what they are now...
2565 2018-09-12 00:55:28 Return to stocks are almost always to blame!!! We had a policy of only a pharmacist (and then very rarely) could put RTS meds back in a stock bottle.
2566 2018-09-12 00:54:53 Ok..this may be a stretch..but what if Trump is gonna do the same thing? Symbolism is amazing/everyone stocks supplies/military moved into place/deep state in disarray...BOOM...spring trap.

2586 2018-09-12 00:40:02 Yes thinking $weed and $aph are holding their own and may trade sideways for a bit. I don’t know about you but I am waiting for $riv.v to come on the market, the spin off from Canopy. Should hopefully be next week.

2591 2018-09-12 00:32:30 I'm a novice trader, learning as much as I can every day. I do notice that most of the setups that are covered in the market recaps with Bao and others, are mostly penny stocks with very limited shares to short. I also have a small account. Would you recommend going long first?

2596 2018-09-12 00:27:42 Employment numbers are meaningless in a low wage, gig economy. These jobs don’t pay a living wage, health insurance eats up any consumer buying power & the 1% are buying back their own stocks & creating the next market bubble. GOP are engineering the next crash like 1987 & 2008.

Are you aware that your job growth is limited to white people? Check it out. Do something to keep growth equal. CEO's are using xtra tax $ to buy back stocks not giving raises or jobs.
2600 2018-09-12 00:25:34 and that's exactly what it did. It broke down from that mini bear flag. It's an intraday pattern. Get over it. Stocks break down then if they stop going down they go back up
2601 2018-09-12 00:25:26 I heard that stock buybacks artificially inflate the price of stocks, I think it could create a bubble.
2602 2018-09-12 00:25:17 Seriously!  The only thing I know about stocks is that if I live long enough I can eventually dip into my retirement account.
2603 2018-09-12 00:24:41 Inflation sa inyung mata. Mahal na daw ang bugas. Alangan di mo mahal ang bugas nga naglisud sa stocks kay katong mga di kabalo mo Tulon sa una kabalo naman mo Tulon karun, mao pay mo dung’ag. Para iwas tukhang daw.  Iba si duterte

2609 2018-09-12 00:19:24 Yeah I’ve been making soup stocks, clarifying butter, peeling tomatoes, and breading and frying zucchini and squash. Plus cleaning. My feet hurt. Even my big toe hurts. Ha
2610 2018-09-12 00:18:45 Bear markets - 

Stocks that have ALREADY fallen a lot, will fall MORE. 

Stocks that are falling, will keep falling. 

Stocks that HAVEN'T fallen a lot, will fall LATER. 

Note - it's a general point. We are nowhere near a bear market.
2611 2018-09-12 00:17:22 I didn't realize all these good folks were here on Twitter discussing mj and mining stocks as well as other great trade ideas. I'm gonna like it here. #potstocks #miningstocks #stockstowatch
2612 2018-09-12 00:16:50 Im a Hurricane Andrew 'surviver'.  I quoted that cuz your gonna have a lot more to worry about than losing your ability to trade for possibly a very long time.

2624 2018-09-12 00:11:05 No. The money banks lend out have to be repaid. No one us obligated to repay shareholders anything when it comes to stocks.

The value of a stock comes from the “exchange of money.” The money in banks “is money.”
2625 2018-09-12 00:10:20 You do know that he doesn’t actually have access to that money right? It’s all tied up in his stocks. He gets paid less than $200,000 a year.

2636 2018-09-12 00:01:43 Maybe many are buying stocks at the new lower price. It will level off and then possibly go into a nose dive spiral to a new low for another sell off buy up. Boycott for the long term is strong.Understand the clothes don't make the man/woman.
