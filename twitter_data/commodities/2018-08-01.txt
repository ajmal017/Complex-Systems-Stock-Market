6 2018-08-01 22:57:44 At the end of the day, middle income countries should not yoke themselves to globally traded commodities because it's very hard to diversify away from them, there is a ton of risk, and they usually don't have enough economic runway built to survive the slippery landing.

Banks feel oversold and good value for the long game.
Commodities have been hammered and are ripe for a bounce.
Gold in particular is on a long term low trend line.
Tech stocks look to be picking up steam again after a bad start to 2018.

That's just my opinion.

36 2018-08-01 21:39:39 if you want kenyans to support you  make amendment on tax bill that increases tax on petrol paraffin and all commodities common kenyans use
37 2018-08-01 21:38:03 The perceived lack of depth is also an acknowledgement of unknown commodities. Specifically Patterson and Dorsett. Patterson’s role, if any, is unclear. Dorsett is expected to have more opportunity.  I see that group as more of a mystery than a shallow pool.

45 2018-08-01 20:50:51 we should expect prices of such new commodities to be volatile at first, the price discovery phase can last for a while as ppl sort out how much value this stuff actually has.

We have failed to give them legal status, and to settle them in American homes.
48 2018-08-01 20:36:39 Reminds me of that saying that someone who is appreciated will do more than expected. That employer does not respect employees, but sees them as commodities rather than people

50 2018-08-01 20:31:12 I could explain this all day, but surprising people don’t understand. Commodities have long shelf lives, to which TVs, and PCs are. 

Every single data point, and I have thousands of behavioral research data points on this, confirms the smartphone is not a commodity.

53 2018-08-01 20:23:17 Economies grow well in most countries, but energy production seems to lack behind and debt levels are too high.

So we should pay more of commodities, rise lower wages, keep interests down and produce more energy, trade more, divide production more ?
54 2018-08-01 20:20:27 Eu olho para a coluna "Jogadores" e sempre me faço uma pergunta: essa coluna é de "receita" mesmo? Se sim, seguimos, também no futebol, meros exportadores de commodities semibeneficiadas?
55 2018-08-01 20:14:10 Clearly I'm the only one investing in #commodities these days. Still buying the dip & waiting for the rout to finish. One thing I guarantee you I will not be doing is buying equities when the bull market is on its way and equities are up 20-30%.

59 2018-08-01 19:47:08 And before someone tries to myopically focus on “groceries” they are defined as food and other commodities sold and purchased at a grocer’s store.

63 2018-08-01 19:24:07 Translation from Jay Powell's Fed minutes. "Sorry but economy is so fragile that the only way to hold things together is to pretend we are raising rates. Then we have to use #HFT to attack prices on commodities. Finally, we use #Collusion to allow banks to front run investors.
64 2018-08-01 19:24:05 Information is like bottled water.  Its the lowest of commodities.  If someone wants to make money from it, then they have to figure out how to be a Fiji.  The last differentiators are the ones that present/analyze it better than others.

67 2018-08-01 18:57:16 And I'd argue those exceptions prove the rules. Investors & studios like to protect their investments, so they like to cast & hire proven commodities. 

You ever see THE PLAYER? How the studio heads react when they hear those filmmakers want to make a movie without stars?
68 2018-08-01 18:55:29 Maybe If Sonko allocated cash to healthcare, they would buy commodities
69 2018-08-01 18:49:37 The Feds needs to reverse course on the interest rate.  The GDP is inflated last minute buying before tariffs, new construction slowed, wages flat , commodities up.  All ingredients for a recession.
70 2018-08-01 18:49:13 Maybe a top 5 talent, but Idk how much weight his one great season from five years ago holds. Don’t think a team with any of those top 10-15 guys would bet on him over their proven commodities.
71 2018-08-01 18:47:50 Except those exceptions for tRump to keep his properties running with cheap immigrant labor. Just like all the tRump commodities made off shore!
72 2018-08-01 18:39:17 If commodities become cheaper in dollars they become cheaper in every currency. That then will not benefit only China’s comparitive advantage.

75 2018-08-01 18:15:45 So a mechanism inherently needs a consumable good which is economically valuable. Other digital commodities that have real economical value are bandwidth, flip-flops, memory. But electricity is the hardest commodity to produce, which is desired for the mechanism in base layer.
76 2018-08-01 18:10:53 Thom:
This isn't your topic of the day but I want to bring up trade. China may put a 25% terrific of log imports from US on Sept. 1st. Already have terriffs on grain. Both commodities are exports of Russia. Isn't that a consistentence?

82 2018-08-01 17:51:23 Taxes to provide safety and security are necessary. Taxes to provide commodities is theft. We have a market system where people buy what they want. Being reliant on the government is a crutch. People should be able to choose what healthcare they have/ don’t have

89 2018-08-01 17:02:46 I pay 30% i come tax. That gets me healthcare, sick pay, 15 months paid leave when our children were born, FREE University, paid vacation and pension. Commodities and services are expensive in Norway, but very affordable.
90 2018-08-01 17:02:01 Another way to look at urban-global elites vs rural folks- Intellectual property producers vs commodities producers.
91 2018-08-01 16:55:15 There’s no such thing as “Russian gas”.  Gas, oil, gold, wheat, copper, all commodities are traded, bought, and sold on the Global market. Trump doesn’t understand that we live in a Global market.
92 2018-08-01 16:54:34 It also helps if you stop letting fear lead you by the nose. Hate porn and fear porn are the Commodities of the news media. Turn them off, #walkaway and be happy.

114 2018-08-01 15:24:55 People make mistakes in high-pressure situations. A loss in a game sucks, but it’s not like anyone died. I’m always on the side of the player, management treats them like commodities, so much so that people like ADP and Buffon were pushed out when they were viewed as spent.
115 2018-08-01 15:23:21 So if you find yourself in my village where girls are still seen as commodities to be traded some day, and a girl wowed by the way you dress, by the fact that you are speaking and everyone is listening ask you about feminism, you gonna reduce it to this? Cooking? Marriage?


116 2018-08-01 15:23:07 This is what happens when sentient beings are reduced to mere commodities.
117 2018-08-01 15:21:21 They have been buying up African mines and natural resources for 10+ years and gained commanding ownership in certain commodities. They have had the money to buy existing projects and develop new ones while EU/US has been recovering economically.
118 2018-08-01 15:20:29 Cash is a means to facilitate fair and equitable trade. Values for commodities are determined via supply and demand principles. Before we had this system it was the barter system where values of commodities varied widely from town to town. That can only work on a small scale.
119 2018-08-01 15:18:45 El precio de todos los commodities esta dolarizado, pero el precio de los commodities no es lo misml en todos lados.

El barril en USA sale un 10% menos que en Europa.

Puede bajar un poco el precio, pero hasta ahi.

126 2018-08-01 14:49:29 In the market economy the worker sells his services as other people sell their commodities. The employer is not the employee’s lord. He is simply the buyer of services which he must purchase at their market price.

233 2018-08-01 06:27:58 Listening to financial news at night, like I usually do, there seems to be a lot of handwringing about commodities... however there is positive discussion about copper

236 2018-08-01 06:08:25 I seriously think that over the last 30 or so years we’ve lost the fact that we are all connected. Animals included. Look at how companies are ravaging the Earth. Nothing is sacred. If we live in a world where slavery is still alive & well, animals are just commodities. 4 $$$

239 2018-08-01 05:23:34 Congress must make it a big issue and go to streets across India on price rise of essential commodities , but , alas , congress netas r fond of bhashans and do not fight for issues facing the general public
240 2018-08-01 05:11:55 selling the future,selling an idea,selling the interest of the client closes the deal, commodities they can get everywhere else
241 2018-08-01 05:09:39 To work well as economic stimulus (i.e. the view of rightist UBI proponents) UBI must provide enough to help enable consumption of non-essential commodities. But at this level it also provides enough to enable those who live austerely to minimise their work commitments.
242 2018-08-01 05:03:51 When we describe major economies it's pointless mentioning individual commodities, since there will always be, for whatever reason, individual losers. 

Trump's USA has great growth and employment. He is positively reconfiguring the US's trade with the  world, especially China.

244 2018-08-01 04:48:02 Healthcare is "made up" too; but you wouldn't think it all that clever of me to say "I don't care about healthcare because it's made up, like money and commodities".
You're just picking which "made up" concepts you think is stronger based on your own preconceptions.
245 2018-08-01 04:42:42 Não tínhamos uma dívida pública chegando a 4 trilhões, não tínhamos oportunidades de crescimento com a globalização e as commodities vendidas a China após seu boom financeiro, FHC, LULA, Dilma e os malditos esquerdas acabaram com o país!

247 2018-08-01 04:36:26 The most valuable commodities, yet they are under payed and like you say....spend a lot of their own money on supplies for their students without regret or reproach. I think if teachers were paid better, you’d find the best teachers to inspire young people.
248 2018-08-01 04:11:13 Most Wall Street gurus suggest about $10K to get started as a position trader. What's the rule of thumb for a day/swing trader with regards to initial start-up capital as it applies to the commodities market?

250 2018-08-01 03:52:56 Imploring a social subsidy to keep American made commodities at a low price while also crippling a widely and high demand Chinese staple- is economic genius. You wanna cater to the fastest growing economy or make America competitive again? Let me ask /2
251 2018-08-01 03:49:23 It's not the water you swim in; Capitalism's effect on our lives is most direct in paying rent to a landlord. It's mostly indirect, effecting the price of everything you buy due to commodities trading and corporate interests, but it's not you buying the stuff directly.
252 2018-08-01 03:39:30 0 electricity, US= 0 & we All Will Be S.O.L. Few will able to work for long w/o gas/diesel for generators, 0 fuel stations, they will be closed, semi's can't haul/keep food cold w/o it. ALL of our markets will shut down, commodities will rot, US will go to hell in a hand basket.
253 2018-08-01 03:33:54 Duh. Trade tariffs are never good for countries like the US that don't make anything the rest of the world can't by cheaper somewhere else, like China; and for commodities like aluminum, steel & paper, where else? Russia.

259 2018-08-01 03:00:40 Companies need to understand there we live in an age of endless choice. You have to compete to keep your employees as much as they need to work to keep their job. You can’t treat people like commodities anymore. People can now shop around for places to work more than ever.
260 2018-08-01 02:35:48 Good question.  Will take a look on tomorrow’s Commodities show on @BNNBloomberg
261 2018-08-01 02:34:57 Everything made of steel will have at least a 25% raw material add-on.

Farm commodities crashing due to #TrumpTariffTax and trade war. Better learn to get by on bread and water soon.

Many farms will be underwater.
262 2018-08-01 02:34:29 Prolly nothing. Well me anyway. @Rosy_Rozay & @TeamTiff_ are hot commodities tho so idk what u got in mind
263 2018-08-01 02:30:43 She dealt major weight cocaine and worked with a drug cartel. How do drig cartels enforce and protect their commodities? It is absolutely absurd to say she is a non-violent offender.
264 2018-08-01 02:24:07 Quick question, Steve, which commodities get more govt subsidies? soybeans, sugar, wheat or apples? What’s wrong with this picture? If apples cost a quarter, would they outsell $1.75 candy bars?
265 2018-08-01 02:15:43 Kind of a risky pick at that ADP when there are proven commodities available in the same range.

271 2018-08-01 01:48:55 Lets see...

I'd say around $175,000 if i didn't have to pay taxes, the rest would be divided up into commodities, real estate, perhaps a venture if someone pitches me something good. I'd save a portion for when the stocks crash, pick up some of those cheap.
272 2018-08-01 01:39:48 No, I'm not a communist and I don't believe in government programs. I believe in free markets, the only way to properly value all commodities.
273 2018-08-01 01:35:41 a mentor who truly cares makes all the difference. you have been that for many. I was just verbally abused and physically intimidated by an AAU coach in front of my son. real men don’t bully women. the cost to these kids is real. they aren’t commodities, they aren’t for sale.
274 2018-08-01 01:34:59 You gain 3 upgrades by trading away unknown commodities without sacrificing the future. It shows he is all in for this season and feels this team can make a run not only this year, but for years to come.
275 2018-08-01 01:29:40 Good luck to the computer for an easier and more like commodities.
276 2018-08-01 01:18:03 I feel like adjusting robustly for changing supply and demand of commodities is more or less what capitalism is for?
277 2018-08-01 01:17:17 Retweeted DrPMX (@DrPMX):

@guardian Why even ask the question? It's pure colonialism - they are actively raping, pillaging, and exploiting African resources and commodities for themselves. The Chinese make the British look like bastions of hope and liberty in comparison.
278 2018-08-01 01:09:15 Ag commodities rally, new article about tariffs, ag commodities plunge, ag commodities rally, new article about tariffs, ag commodities plunge, rinse and repeat since February.  Don't throw me in the brier patch eventually.
279 2018-08-01 01:03:50 It’s just not the price of diapers. There’s also toilette paper and other commodities as well.
280 2018-08-01 01:00:28 I hope that’s true but they’re unproven commodities when it comes to being elite, or really good, SEC RB’s.
281 2018-08-01 00:59:32 Not sure I would be on the long side of commodities.
282 2018-08-01 00:58:32 P&G passes on to shoppers the extra cost of commodities hit by trade tariffs.
283 2018-08-01 00:56:00 its very sad. I even provided the definition of groceries that states food and/or commodities sold by a grocer.

definition of commodities; an article of trade or commerce. Therefore, what he said was technically correct.
284 2018-08-01 00:53:07 There is  no commodity that cannot be utilized into becoming a means a production since the usage of a commodity is determined by individual utility. That's why the distribution of commodities was decided completely by the state in socialist countries like the USSR and Cambodia.
285 2018-08-01 00:47:55 you know what I always say: it isn't a complete setup unless people routinely mistake you for a commodities trader.

288 2018-08-01 00:39:54 Tyson says chicken going up cause glut of beef & pork during tariffs (been able to buy corn cheap as hell), P&G says paper going up because wood prices going up; consumer prices never go down when commodities go down. Only thing cheaper today than 20 years ago is a damn pizza.
289 2018-08-01 00:39:18 Doubt many Americans are going to "thrive" on lowering minimum wage and the cost of soaring commodities, housing, and gas prices. The Trumps are just blowing more smoke. We aren't buying it anymore.

291 2018-08-01 00:28:50 You cannot relinquish a right. You can relinquish property and time which are commodities. Don’t try and equate Christianity with socialist dogma. Especially if you are going to be so bad at doing it.
