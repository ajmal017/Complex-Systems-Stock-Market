52 2018-11-19 23:42:55 Issue is that Pamela Anderson was talking seriously about a political issue - about which I profoundly DISAGREE with her. That's got nothing to do with her prior career. If I met a female investment professional who used to model - & I have - do I joke about that or talk stocks?
53 2018-11-19 23:41:06 A quiet day in FX with slight USD weakness across the board except for AUD which has broken back below previous support at 0.7300 and is weaker on its crosses. JPY has strengthened across the board with lower US yields and stocks under pressure once again.
54 2018-11-19 23:40:46 But @patrickbitature I think you being a master in the business world you need to also educate Ugandan's about the importance of business partnerships and buying stocks. Because majority set small businesses which can't even sustain them thanks I hope to hear from you.

57 2018-11-19 23:39:21 over valued, look at the amount of capital just in these stocks compared to the rest of the market. Trends last for a time, but usually do not last forever.
58 2018-11-19 23:39:15 33 million acres of forest in CA. So we need 33 million Californians to buy rakes and get after their acre. Buy rake stocks!
59 2018-11-19 23:38:56 I’m case anyone was wondering about my neighbors routine, he stocks his fridge with beer, watches bmw reviews on YouTube and then Netflix and chills

64 2018-11-19 23:37:16 I hate people that ask me questions in the comments of a post on certain stocks or whatever and don’t bother to reply with a thank you  pelan! 
65 2018-11-19 23:35:20 Honestly, wasn't it obvious long ago that #stocks couldn't keep soaring while incomes were near-flat and a visibly huge percent of "jobs" nil-wage - and that stocks have thus been a bubble for some time?
66 2018-11-19 23:35:14 I might add that another way to look at this is that active stock managers have skills, and that outperformance through active stock selection has been demonstrated for past two decades. Picking stocks and not paying mutual fund fees is another way of looking at the conclusion.
67 2018-11-19 23:32:56 I forgot I invested in stocks w John senior year and I texted him asking him what ended up happening to it and he sent me $100 
68 2018-11-19 23:32:18 When that equity investment crashes you won’t say anything 

If someone had 1 BTC and somebody had stocks worth the same amount which person could accomplish more in the real world

95 2018-11-19 23:20:06 I don’t understand why they don’t teach students real things in school, like how to build credit, balance checkbooks, or invest in stocks.

96 2018-11-19 23:19:47 My theory of bullish BAWs dooming things is kind of working. It happened for Bitcoin, China internet stocks, and now FANG, a bit. Looks like it works best with momentum things.

101 2018-11-19 23:16:35 Why stocks keep dropping. 
Easy, democrats have power. 
There is no confidence in economic gain w dems in power. 
They have always been a negative on our GDP. THEY STOP GROWTH. They spend all our money and tie up courts on fibulous law suits.

117 2018-11-19 23:03:49 I thought I was negative, but some investors are so much more. Why focus on stocks being down vs ones that are up.  It's like looking for bad restaurants to avoid vs good ones to eat at.

126 2018-11-19 22:58:05 The uranium stocks held up pretty well today IMO. It would be nice to see rotation into them and maybe we are to a degree. The bigger names may get hit harder as they are more likely to be held by broad market investors needing to raise cash.

128 2018-11-19 22:56:49 Im still young enough to ride out drops in the market. I look at it as stocks being on sale which is gonna help me in the long run.
129 2018-11-19 22:55:13 Scary is that there is no guarantee for alts, they are the tech stocks of 2000. With S&P shaking I doubt anyone on Wallstreet is going to hold retails bags. BTC 1000 seems really hard tho
130 2018-11-19 22:55:12 Thought stocks run out?
131 2018-11-19 22:52:46 The issue isn't tech stocks, the issues are macro, trade wars and higher interest rates. Will the Fed suck all the liquidity out of the market, which is already contracting PE's in a big way. 12 month forward PE of the SandP now 15.5 vs 16.4 average over past 5 years.
132 2018-11-19 22:52:14 When the taxi cab driver asks how your stocks are doing, you're glad you're out...
133 2018-11-19 22:51:23 When people get nervous about the market, the stocks that have done the best get sold off first. This has to do with basic economics, not Tech.
134 2018-11-19 22:51:01 this is bullish for stocks
135 2018-11-19 22:51:00 Watching @CNBCFastMoney and scratching my head. They keep talking about fallen momo stocks and price to earnings. Since when was p/e a relevant metric on Wall Street?

Any re stocks for small or medium?
139 2018-11-19 22:49:01 Why are stocks worth anything? I can't understand this. Yes, many pay dividends, but many don't, and the dividends seem to be small compared to the stock price. They seem to get their value entirely from the expectation they'll be more valuable later. Why!?

142 2018-11-19 22:48:13 Stocks fell sharply Monday, dragged down by reports that @Apple's newest line of phones may not be selling as well as Apple or its investors had hoped. The Dow fell 400 points and the Nasdaq tumbled 2.7%. Apple's stock fell once more after the....

144 2018-11-19 22:48:03 1) We don't want the 2nd Amendment repealed. 2) You don't get the individual right to bear arms from the 2nd Amendment, but from Justice Antonin Scalia's decision in Heller v. D.C. and 3) We want sensible reforms like making AR-15s and bump stocks unavailable to the public.
145 2018-11-19 22:47:01 makes me even more bullish on $NVDA and $TWLO because they're behind the scenes powering a lot of what makes these Fang stocks money (AI / deep learning / automation, endless list). Endless growth opps.
146 2018-11-19 22:47:01 #ASX200 #Australia #stocks Just absurd levels and fantastic buying. I know it is staying heavy, but it has no reason to. Well into the very last gasp moments of this down move. Fantastic buying. Especially after any further decline this morning. Great opportunity capturing low!
147 2018-11-19 22:45:01 If you wear a thick coat deer hunting 1” shorter stock actually fits awesome. 
Maybe you just need a new set of stocks for your 12 gauge 870?

163 2018-11-19 22:36:56 An anti rape law is a law that says rape is a crime. Every state criminalizes rape. It doesn't prevent all rapes, because rapes still happen. But I'm pretty sure less rapes happen because of criminal laws.
And no one wants to ban all guns, clearly. But bump stocks, ARs, etc.

176 2018-11-19 22:33:46 Bloomberg's quick Thanksgiving take  on the US economy:: Turkey is cheaper, wages are higher and prices are under control. The Fed is being responsive, not aggressive, and the bond market is gloomier than stocks
177 2018-11-19 22:33:07 probably not, I get mine at Kroger cause it's the only place that actually stocks any that I get to before the scalpers get in, and they're pretty behind on ordering usually
178 2018-11-19 22:32:56 Reminder that diversification should mean something beyond buying multiple cryptocurrencies of different design. It should include stocks, bonds, some cash, precious metals, etc.
179 2018-11-19 22:32:50 There was a really great article in @NatGeo about effects of soy on men actually few yrs ago. And yeah, personally i think i would be okay with lab grown meat-meat, but def not veg meat (which literally is not meat). But i’d bet on this company’s stocks :)
180 2018-11-19 22:32:25 All 5 FAANG stocks, $FB $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX and $GOOGL ended up down -3.82% or more today.

Here's every day in history where all 5 stocks did that poorly (or worse):

▣ November 19, 2018 (today)
▣ October 10, 2018 (3rd worst day of 2018)
▣ August 21, 2015 (Aug 2015 flash crash)
181 2018-11-19 22:32:03 And now your stocks will crash. Be careful what you wish for.

186 2018-11-19 22:26:01 Are you like 20? TRICKLE DOWN  is not a LEFT concept. Bush Junior, gave tax breaks, to EVERYONE. CIRPORATIONS, TOOK THEIR TAXES TO buy back stocks, not expansion of manufacturing in US. CORPORATIONS took their windfall, to poor countries with no labor standards, of eoa standards.
187 2018-11-19 22:25:09 The big techs are lower this time but check out the defensive stocks. Looking good on this second round.
188 2018-11-19 22:24:04 It's interesting isn't it how non NHS providers (Boots, Tesco etc) seemed to have stocks, and indeed patients have been sent there in some cases...
189 2018-11-19 22:24:03 Nope. It isn't. All you did was say all agriculture have stocks/sinks. None of that was clarification. Especially not when all you could dö was write. You are correct & clarification is necessary

198 2018-11-19 22:17:36 Economy is actually not that good anymore.  Stocks took another nose dive today.  Being that it takes at least a few months for the economy to react to policy, I'd say we are seeing the true effects of the "trade war".  Hope I'm wrong, but I would wouldn't keep my hopes high.

211 2018-11-19 22:13:10 Tech stocks taking a beating anyone surprised when global markets have been slowing down. In Apples case everyone on the planet has a phone whether iPhone or Android and many manufacturers are out there that offer cheaper phones with all the bells and whistles of the iPhone.
212 2018-11-19 22:13:09 I dont think this a trap. Algo's selling because this market is propped up on a hand full of stocks that are getting hammered for a number of diff reasons. Along with news from Brexit and interest rates. The market is moving on news. Could see a up day Tues and Wed if no new news
213 2018-11-19 22:12:58 Went from no one wanting utlities and telcos to huge sector inflows. Smart money already dumped growth stocks. Only retail suckers at home clinging on hoping to breakeven

219 2018-11-19 22:11:42 What's all this stuff about Apple and iphones?  The entire VA, where I work has replaced all cell phones with iphones.  I have to believe that comes from a federal contract with Apple... yet stocks are down
220 2018-11-19 22:10:32 After scanning thousands of individual charts, I see few standouts and high risk/low reward with majority of stocks breaking down. $SPY $QQQ
221 2018-11-19 22:10:05 Thanks for the reply Trevor. I know my mobile number is correct because I have had texts inviting me to attend again. Just wondered if there was another reason for no text, such as the blood not being used if stocks too high at time or something.
222 2018-11-19 22:09:40 When the stock market closes at the end of the day, why does everyone stand around smiling and clapping regardless of whether the stocks are up or down?

239 2018-11-19 21:58:11 Because you clearly don’t understand economics. Which I am currently taking. Just explain, in your words, how stocks work. I’ll know if you use google.
240 2018-11-19 21:57:55 It actually doesn't--I'm talking about throughputs, stocks & sinks, which deal with rates of usage and replacement, and precisely do NOT ascribe some intrinsic, fundamental essence or level, let alone one from which humans are excepted.
241 2018-11-19 21:57:23 My theory about this dump: some massive whales are triangulating usd-crypt-shares in some way that we can't understand yet, this is pushing the price down with stocks. Can't bilive that craig-ver-jihar can do this with a entire market.
242 2018-11-19 21:55:18 The Dow Closed at the Borders of 24,000 Zone down for the day 396 points wiping out the stocks’ gains for November thus far. The other indices were down in a straight loss for the past 4 sessions

246 2018-11-19 21:53:08 The rising popularity of Bitcoin last year was a direct result of the lack of volatility in equity markets. Now that volatility has returned to stocks, Bitcoin no longer serves a purpose for traders. And since it serves no purpose to anyone else, maybe it can finally disappear.
247 2018-11-19 21:53:01 The Dow and the NASDAQ tell rich people how their stocks are doing.

They don't tell everyone else if they're likely to lose their job, or if they're likely to have to work EVEN MORE hours to make ends meet next month.
248 2018-11-19 21:51:53 Here's my luck, sold amazon at $350, 100% gain, sold netflix at $100, almost 200% gain, sold amd ( most) at $17, 300% gain. Now look at all these stocks. So, I'm keeping Tesla, instead of 300%, looking for 4000% gain, so I plan to be 100% in Tesla soon.
249 2018-11-19 21:51:33 a-are u playing 3 stocks or
250 2018-11-19 21:51:31 I did ye :) They have a black Friday sale on right now! Website is really slow and going down every minute but stocks won't last this much longer
251 2018-11-19 21:50:51 True. I dont' like stocks at all, but truth is that if you see the long term, one could state that you've earned 50% in 5 years, more or less. #patience #longterm @garyvee
252 2018-11-19 21:50:45 It seems as the market grows so will knowledge and awareness. I saw the same cycle of market growth and companies coming along for the hype of the sector and not the reality of the market happen in a major way back in 2013 and 2014 in Marijuana Stocks.
253 2018-11-19 21:50:36 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA I'm 28 and own $200 in weed stocks as my entire life's savings.
254 2018-11-19 21:50:23 it's also indisputable that ALL forms of agriculture--including more sustainable ones, like agroecology & permaculture--are higher throughput, and use up more stocks & sinks than does foraging etc., bc land use & regimentation is inherently ecologically costly, no ifs &s or buts
255 2018-11-19 21:49:54 4k coming. We need to look at the big picture. Stocks market is crashing. Look Nvida, AMD, Apple, Amazon etc...
so it's not only BTC, it's everything ! Back to 2008 ?
256 2018-11-19 21:49:39 After looking at all these charts, LOTS of stocks are on top of key resistance levels. Funny how these things work. After such a washout day today, I wouldn't be surprised to see buyers come tomorrow.. but what do I know?.. Seriously, what do I know :/
257 2018-11-19 21:48:36 Tech-Werte weiter unter Druck. TecDax -2,15%, Nasdaq -3,33% #etfs #indizes #stocks
258 2018-11-19 21:48:09 As far as savings go, I'd say open a funds and shares account (I use @HLInvest) and go for a stable fund or if you have the time, invest in solid long term growth stocks. I've made more on that in the last 3months than the past 10 years with an ISA

261 2018-11-19 21:45:21 Husband got a job in California.  I quit my job and lived as his dependent in a foreign country without work authorization.  I save a LOT of money over time through stocks and RRSP, so I had quite a cushion to rely on.  I saved us a lot of money too by cooking every day.
262 2018-11-19 21:44:55 Look at the big picture. Stocks market is crashing, not only $BTC

265 2018-11-19 21:44:36 Car il faut vidé les stocks.

He's a great player.
270 2018-11-19 21:42:34 "It was completely legal for the Vegas shooter to buy multiple AR-15s. He did so with no resistance, even though he had a history of mental illness." What new laws would prevent this? Bump stocks are easy to make, he passed a BGC, and it takes two seconds to change mags.

You’re saying someone who works in the fast food industry (i.e. burger flippers) has the least bearing in the functioning of that business? or the individual who stocks shelves has little bearing at Walmart?

304 2018-11-19 21:29:27 Despite the pain inflicted over the last two months, the S&P is down 'only' 7.5% from its peak; the Dow 8.5%.  The Nasdaq, over weighted with tech stocks, is down 13.5% - and is the only index in a correction state by definition, or down 10% or more.

We are bearish stocks, bearish bonds, bullish commodities, bullish cash & bearish the US dollar. Our stock-bond-cash asset allocation heading into 2019 would be: 50% equities, 25% bonds, and 25% cash.

"We see all 8 value factors higher, with 7 of our 8 up at least 1%, while conversely we see 5 of 6 Growth factors lower" as the Growth-Value trade unwind is accelerating.

"Not only does the price action this year suggest we are in the midst of a bear market--more than 40 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 are down at least 20 percent--but it also trades like a bear market."
316 2018-11-19 21:26:22 It was a joke? Really? Why did you wrote 'But actually (from wikipedia) On September 12th, 2018 UBS repeated their "sell" advice on Elsevier (RELX) stocks?' I do not have sense of humor.

330 2018-11-19 21:22:34 Similar story for the rest of the stocks in this miserable market, however, this was big news for #AEG & many other stories do not have much of a backbone, should do well over the coming week or two at the very least
331 2018-11-19 21:21:30 Only 10 of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow are down for the year and as it stands today, it's almost dead center in the 52 week trading range.  There was a time when a 1-2% change in the Dow wasn't news - I wonder when that might have been. I'm bargain hunting myself.
332 2018-11-19 21:21:24 Aussie shares are set to open lower as tech stocks dropped sharply in NY, paced by #Facebook and #Amazon. Boeing, Apple, Visa, Microsoft, Nike and Caterpillar were also among the worst performers. This trading week for SP500 and the Nasdaq is shorter due to #ThanksgivingWeek $RZI

342 2018-11-19 21:19:10 No pipelines because hauling oil by train is much safer as demonstrated by all the train derailments and besides, the left have invested heavy in railways & they need to boost those earnings on stocks.
343 2018-11-19 21:18:39 World stocks ex Asia tumble: US -1.7%; Europe -.7%. Fear dominated US markets as investors fled to safety. US bond yields fell sharply. Investors spoiled by 20+% eps-growth, fear 2019 single-digit growth. Foolish: Reality will set in & market will move higher. Patience rewarded.
344 2018-11-19 21:18:35 Nope. Sensible gun regulation. There is no need for extended mags, bump stocks, or gun shows where you aren’t background checked. It was completely legal for the Vegas shooter to buy multiple AR-15s. He did so with no resistance, even though he had a history of mental illness.
345 2018-11-19 21:18:18 October and November have indicated that tech stocks are bloated garbage

349 2018-11-19 21:17:08 Sure. It is done frequently with thin, low float, low cap stocks. With $TSLA all it takes is several well-capitalized trading accounts coordinating at right times. It is an easy matter for all the oil interests to fund this forever with a small portion of their profits.

359 2018-11-19 21:11:33 Facts. But then they don't get health and dental, cell phone stipends, bonuses, stocks, travel reimbursement, etc. Total compensation versus just compensation.
360 2018-11-19 21:11:15 Another massive dumping of tech stocks drags Wall St sharply lower. Nasdaq -3% to end at 7,028, falling through the Oct. selloff closing low of 7,050 on Oct 29.

Dow -395 points, -1.6% to 25,017.  S&P -1.7%. Both still are above Oct closing lows.

370 2018-11-19 21:07:41 Stocks tumble, deepening a rout that has shaken investors' confidence in the tech sector, as the Dow industrials fall nearly 400 points

376 2018-11-19 21:06:46 I wonder if FANG and similar stocks aren't hitting their maturity phase, with the biggest markets having been developed and the future more or less tied to replacement products and organic economic growth.  The so-so IPhone and NVidia numbers might be a sign.
377 2018-11-19 21:06:26 The economy is strong enough to buy high multiple/speculative stocks “on sale”, but it isn’t strong enough to raise rates above historically low levels..... Ok

389 2018-11-19 21:03:23 None taken.  Reason I disagree is in 1940s, the economy was not stock, US tax receipts were not tied to stocks like they are now.  If US stocks fall sharply, IMO deficits will rise non-linearly as consumption falls sharply.  IE not sure UST risk off demand will keep up w/supplies

395 2018-11-19 21:01:40 That's the only thing where I disagree with you Luke (your SPY/TLT thesis). When you are invoking a 1940s analogue, you have to consider that stocks were trading at very low valuations (CAPE 7 vs CAPE 30 today). I favor Albert Edwards thesis of LT gvt. bonds catching one last bid
396 2018-11-19 21:01:24 One of the more worrying outcomes from tonight’s #Agrifish is agreement to remove six catch limits entirely, for various stocks. EU institutions finding inventive ways around the policy rather than implementing it. #EndOverfishing

STOCKS CRASH: The Dow fell over 500 points today. Pres. Trump gave himself an ‘A+’ on his handling of the economy in a Fox News exclusive interview yesterday, adding ‘Can I go higher than that?’
410 2018-11-19 20:54:14 Good! When the recession hits so he can take in properties and stocks on the cheap, to mind that trumpite by quoting their words back at them. 
Then you can do a "Told you so" dance.

412 2018-11-19 20:53:42 and that is where the issues lies. Builders escaped smaller homes, build only bigger ones to make the most money because they can't compete with cheaper existing inventory and now supply is over 6.5 months, that is an issue for them and why the stocks are down 30%-40% for some
413 2018-11-19 20:53:34 New crop is still a long way away but acreage are up +/- everywhere. And all the stocks of wheat are milling. After that Quality is subjective. Often depends who makes the bread . I remember you that the better bread is made not with Russian but French Wheat 
414 2018-11-19 20:53:27 FANG stocks YTD: 2 are down (-25% & -2%) and 2 are up (+41% & 30%). Overall average +11% YTD. Does not seem like carnage to me.
415 2018-11-19 20:53:13 42% of S&P stocks in a bear market.  What a twist!

They are not going to buy uber stocks that would have a zero value in 6 mths of IPO in the mean time investors loses great news
422 2018-11-19 20:49:59 A long #bullmarket sets investors up for massive losses. The bull creates great conviction that stocks are invulnerable, lengthening significantly the time it takes for investors to comprehend that they are being levelled by the bear. "Buy the dip" equates to: swallow the hemlock
423 2018-11-19 20:49:56 Cnbc says stocks plunge after poor homebuilder sentiment but that sector is actually higher on the day.  It’s technology and industrials getting hammered. Totally unrelated to homebuilder sentiment. These guys just write whatever they’re told without thinking.
424 2018-11-19 20:48:56 A #BEARMARKET takes stocks lower than anyone could believe, way beyond "fair value."   It exemplifies Keynes' dictum:  "Markets can remain irrational far longer than investors can remain solvent."

In some cases, over 100 points. Why do you think health care stocks have done so good since 2016?

501 2018-11-19 20:19:06 We only need to drop a few bombs on China's artificial islands in the SCS, and them dollars would come screaming home. Defense stocks are still a good buy.
502 2018-11-19 20:18:59 Always better to be proactive than reactive. A wish list will allow you to take advantage of blue-light specials while others are getting shaken out of great long-term stocks. #stocks #investing

507 2018-11-19 20:14:24 via GerberKawasaki: Tech sell off way overblown.  This is a re-calibration of high PE stocks to lower PE's thanks to rates and trade wars. This seems to be a retest. Other than facebook, we do like Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. $Goog $AAPL $AMZN $GOOG $amzn

510 2018-11-19 20:14:11 But even if it’s still sealed and good condition they still won’t give the right amount. Like I’m ok with losing a few bucks but more than that is just ridiculous. Policies like these rapidly lose customers which is why GameStop’s stocks have been decreasing most of the time

New York Times: The sell-off in tech stocks continued, as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft all dropped more than 3 percent....

520 2018-11-19 20:08:55 I see way too many stocks on my screen that are down 10-15%. WTF
521 2018-11-19 20:08:43 $TSLA Now if only the rest of the tech stocks would be resilient as Tesla. It's not too late to start. November hasn't ended yet.
522 2018-11-19 20:08:24 & the total is a net loss for the working poor. That deductions not high enough if you take away the deductions as they have.

Anyone too poor to have a nice fistful of stocks, and a retirement portfolio... not 'gaining' on this one.

524 2018-11-19 20:07:51 STOCKS CRASH: The Dow fell over 500 points today. Pres. Trump gave himself an ‘A+’ on his handling of the economy in a Fox News exclusive interview yesterday, adding ‘Can I go higher than that?’
525 2018-11-19 20:07:49 Tech stocks get crushed today is the most Groundhog Day headline of 2018. Reboot the crash machine:
Square $SQ -10%
Nvidia $NVDA -9%
AMD $AMD -6%
Adobe $ADBE -8%
Facebook $FB -5%
Netflix $NFLX -5%
Amazon $AMZN -4%
Apple $AAPL -4%
Microsoft $MSFT -3%
Alphabet $GOOG -3%
526 2018-11-19 20:06:59 That hasn't stopped a dozen other stocks from getting absolutely slaughtered. The only obvious differences is that the slaughtered stocks don't have cult followings, haven't been privileged with substantial gov't subsidies, and don't have epic scales of financial chicanery.
527 2018-11-19 20:06:36 Not a very nice day in tech stocks, eh? Amazon's off 4.5%, Apple 3.6, Alphabet 3.3, Facebook 5.13, ouch.

533 2018-11-19 20:04:05 HOLIDAY VOLUME WHERE BUYERS ARE UNDER THEIR DESK SO shorts and sellers drive stocks down. Vacuum if buyers and ETF sellers drive everything lower, when theres so much $$ in passive and quant strategies they will overwhelm active buyers because price doesnt matter, good times!
534 2018-11-19 20:04:05 On a big down day like today I always look for pockets of strength or names that hung in there pretty well (aside from typical safe haven stocks like staples). Today $IVZ $STT are in the green. So if the general market were to bottom I would expect those names to do very well

542 2018-11-19 20:00:01 You can always find something to worry about, and last week investors found Fed rate hikes, trade tensions and the global economy. So they retreated from the risk of stocks, sending all three major indexes down.

544 2018-11-19 19:59:18 Stock markets must have corrections in order to be running as it should be. If stocks only go up then it's not a true indication of free market buying and selling. In order for the stock market to work properly it has to have winners, and it has to have losers.

Since that day, all 5 have been down -3% on the same day only 4x (before today).

568 2018-11-19 19:50:22 Your video was cut off at end. I picked five stocks that met my criteria and 3 are already up over 10% in a down market. Two facts, heavy insider trading, two volume to the upside pre purchase. Next was earnings but small Caps are tricky. You dig. My DD is Digging Diligently.
569 2018-11-19 19:48:49 Good, really happy. Hope they all crash with the exception of Nvidia. But I do like their stocks going down. Cheaper graphics cards. Crypto miners were killing the prices.
570 2018-11-19 19:48:43 Point? Stocks are going down because the fed is tightening, the fed is tightening because of growth. GDP and income are up, I wish they would lay off, but almost zero funds rate for duration of Obama's presidency.

576 2018-11-19 19:47:32 People are desperate to find some precient advantage to predict the next bear before it happens. So they use sectors, advance/decline and individual  stocks "bear" to get ahead of the next true bear. I know some believe bulls are too comfy but bearishness still feels very lively.
577 2018-11-19 19:46:27 my idea with wobbling would be: only allow wobbling when you are down stocks. even stocks or more against the player, no wobbling. sort of like a pseudo wobbling allowance

591 2018-11-19 19:40:45 Thanks Dan. Imho these stocks are discounting a lot, if not a recession, an earnings recession for sure. The multiple compression going on is remarkable. This is fast becoming a cheap market (as long as we don’t have a recession in ‘19)
592 2018-11-19 19:40:33 With the boost to prize money & re-opening Of Eagle  Farm I dare say our stocks will only improve. We may not beat southern invaders but we’ll sure be a lot more competitive.

630 2018-11-19 19:28:25 So we agree at least that Feinstein did NOT try to ban all guns, right? Reasonable people could find limits on guns, right? Bazooka not necessary for civilians, ok? 50 cal not open to 12 year old, ok? Maybe no Bump stocks, right?
631 2018-11-19 19:27:37 FAANG in general has lost it's bite. Nothing is easy. Though these stocks have performed great for years, will this be the big drop or bigger upside ahead? During the drops is when investors get tested and earn the money.
632 2018-11-19 19:27:36 I honestly just use acorns to save money. If you wanna get into stocks & investments, you can take the money saved by acorns then apply it. Cuz they don’t really make you money lol

699 2018-11-19 19:07:53 Agree that the term "bear market" makes no sense for an individual stock, since a market is a collection of stocks. I have heard people say that a stock is in bear territory or in a bear decline, referring to a 20% or more decline, which makes more sense.

713 2018-11-19 19:02:02 Or we can play it with 3 and the gameplay will show which is better. Nothings set in stone. Edge guarding looks a lot more important in this game and with that stocks seem to be easier to lose.  I think that’s a lot of why the game is starting at 3 stocks

719 2018-11-19 19:01:10 Reason I’m bearish on weed stocks: valuations price in best case growth scenarios-> models are dependent on legalization in many countries, and weed prices held constant. 

Current administration is unlikely to legalize

Look @ marijuana price action in legal states.

725 2018-11-19 18:57:37 Dude same. So what if the speed is faster than smash 4? 2 stocks will mean:
1. People need to play smarter and better to not get bodied too fast
2. Games will move along faster and not take forever 
3. People will adapt and be motivated to be better at the game overall.
726 2018-11-19 18:57:17 Tech stocks  take a big hit. The FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google), have a combine lost of over $900 billion dollars after 52 week highs.

763 2018-11-19 18:43:30 @RevolutApp Hello! Great job so far guys  Keep going strong! 
I'm living in Greece and I was wondering when will you open the option "investing" for us, when I'm buying stocks, I'd like to get rid of the Forex middlemen as well if possible!
764 2018-11-19 18:43:19 It has had more return in 10 years than Gold or stocks. Occasional crashes are irrelevant for investors with a high time preference. BTC will inevitably reach new all time highs in less than 3 years, then crash again, repeat, always rising.
765 2018-11-19 18:42:31 Just moved into my new little cottage in West Egg! The view from here is amazing :)) I have yet to meet my neighbors but I am excited for my new job on Wall Street! #stocks #bondsman #goodbyemidwest
766 2018-11-19 18:42:28 Only if it’s on stocks. Crypto is dead for 2 years
767 2018-11-19 18:41:52 I haven’t seen a market this bad since 2008. Mental. Some amazing buying oppurtunities in stocks right now. Blood red everywhere, most tech stocks 20-50% off recent highs
768 2018-11-19 18:41:45 There are people that dedicate their lives to stocks that can’t even do that
769 2018-11-19 18:41:44 Yes these few stocks does have massive impact on the indices
770 2018-11-19 18:41:09 There's a reason their stocks haven't been doing well.
771 2018-11-19 18:41:03 Hopefully. Been watching these failed rallies for months. For normal stocks, these runs would have triggered a short squeeze with the technicals backing it. I think the goal is to prevent those convertibles from hitting their strikes. That's the only thing special about $360.
772 2018-11-19 18:40:59 But I’m only short on stocks
773 2018-11-19 18:40:38 Bizarre thing happened today - I opened my scanner and applied filters and hit search for any stocks with X vol and 2% up and price crossing  SMA50 today.

A pop up message came up:

“ R u  $&@$ nuts ?!? “

Wondering if site is hacked or is it just protecting my interest?
774 2018-11-19 18:40:21 Got a lot of responses back about Last night email list 1 of the stocks pop $5.95 cents.. glad u guys like it email for the next list

776 2018-11-19 18:39:46 To me, a normal thing, that was prolonged for a very long time. If we observe the $AAPL chart, we should see that it had a good corrections before, while these other stocks was not. And $AMZN was to blame for 30% of entire SnP gains Jan-Oct.
777 2018-11-19 18:39:34 U.S. STOCKS EXTEND FALL, NASDAQ DOWN 3.00 PCT

779 2018-11-19 18:38:56 Donc, du fait des #GiletsJaunes les gens ont vidé les stocks des stations essence ET sont contraints de faire + de bornes pour échapper aux blocages. Remplir les caisses de l'état et vider les poches des contribuables, ÇA CHANGE HEIN 
780 2018-11-19 18:38:53 Nah. I still got stocks, a 457, and an investment property that in trying to rehab. I need crypto to bounce back but I don’t think it will before 2020
781 2018-11-19 18:38:48 Carl,  I predict we are getting ready to see a major decline in stocks leading the way to a depression given all of the things that have been done to undermine the fundamentals of the economy.  Families are continuing to struggle and make the wages to keep this economy humming.
782 2018-11-19 18:38:41 Stocks are falling fast. -425 right now
783 2018-11-19 18:38:34 Which sector will fall and which stocks fall will be buying opportunity sir g??

786 2018-11-19 18:37:27 Third quarter #earnings season has been impressive - it's the guidance moving forward that has put some pressure on stocks. @business, with over 90% of S&P companies having reported, earnings have grown at a rate of 26% year-over-year for 80% of companies
787 2018-11-19 18:36:27 CRUDE OIL going up when stocks collapse is exactly like in 2008.

Another $10 drop imminent.
788 2018-11-19 18:36:22 Perhaps Patel is going to turn into a spinning version of Andrew Jones. A late bloomer, who has paid his dues at first class level, and is ready for the step up. Aren't out spin stocks looking good though?

790 2018-11-19 18:35:20 Watching the action. Not forcing anything.  #stocks
791 2018-11-19 18:34:37 Our focus on enhancing returns with #dividends and #option premiums will not change regardless of whether markets are up, down or sideways. During these types of markets, investors tend to shift allocations to high quality stocks with proven track records.
792 2018-11-19 18:33:41 Although stocks have often done well when Washington experiences gridlock, the current scenario also makes a government shutdown or increased investigations into President Trump more likely.  With either of these actions, market volatility could follow.  @cnbc

796 2018-11-19 18:33:14 Of course anyone who prints negative facts regarding the president is not legitimate. I’m watching stocks tank right now, maybe it’s fake news though.

799 2018-11-19 18:32:40 How could the results affect markets?
Post-midterm market results are generally strong. Over the past 18 midterm #elections, #stocks have always had positive returns from their lows in October to the year's end.  @business
800 2018-11-19 18:32:34 The Trump organization owns stocks that belong to those companies that make the weapons and armored Machines that is being sold to Saudi Arabia, that is why he doesn’t want to end the deal with Saudi Arabia!!

802 2018-11-19 18:30:26 The price action in tech stocks reminds me of mid-2008 energy stocks, which were the darling of that era. Just like when the peak oil narrative changed, it seems to have changed here too. Much more negative press for the techs.

804 2018-11-19 18:29:54 If the selloff continues into broader bear market, lot of these high flying stocks that were  70 80 100 120. Will all be going to 10 or single digits. Business model is irrelevant, I could care less about fundamentals $TWLO $ROKU $MDB $TEAM $TTD $OKTA
805 2018-11-19 18:29:48 Surprising how many stocks are trading under 200 day SMA and how many more under 150 day SMA, several more under 50 day SMA. Trend lines need to cross over, one by one and prices needs to steadily grow for that to happen. No hope catching breakouts in the near term.

807 2018-11-19 18:29:05 Can we just stick to how it was and also let people get dash/promo packs for buying online. Not all people have a local shop that stocks the game. This is going to hurt those players who support the game, but just can't buy in store.

812 2018-11-19 18:28:09 Like when you do Option selling, you have an edge over option buyer. These trades will always have more then 50% probability of win over larger number of trades on all stocks, all indexes and all strikes. I think Angad also so such trades but this setup has no specific edge.

820 2018-11-19 18:26:12 Cyber security stocks have been strong performers for the past couple of years,  I believe $FTNT can hold up well in the FANGs. A good way for investors to play the cyber security space is to buy the ETF (HACK). $FB is under immense pressure as investor concerns grow.
821 2018-11-19 18:26:06 Come on 2.25% is not tight for the real economy with a $1tn plus fiscal deficit. Bond yields, credit spreads, concept stocks, all wildly over valued

840 2018-11-19 18:19:27 Ross, don't forget the very high deficit caused by tax cut. it is a big problem for the long bonds! they have to sell more bonds to cover the deficit, which will jack up the 10 year yield beyond 4%, and the discounted cashflow will be much less and cause the stocks to pummel.

847 2018-11-19 18:15:36 The irony is, that you are trumpeting (pun kind of intended) this as the WhiteHouse’s fault. When all the stocks listed are VERY anti-Trump. Maybe consumers are tired of extreme left wing rhetoric?
848 2018-11-19 18:15:04 There is no way when stocks like #AAPL #GOOGL #AAPL are crashing that #BABA will continue to hold up.   Valuation is super high and Chinese trade deal is not going to happen.  #baba is heading towards $120 short with confidence.

850 2018-11-19 18:14:41 The US stocks will steadily decline in the coming years due to reckless speculation and financial policies. The stock correction will eventually turn into recession. If the market doesn’t improve, we will eventually slide into severe recession and may be depression.
851 2018-11-19 18:14:36 (3/3) But if I'm right, this process is only beginning. We're going to see more losses/underperformance from #FAANG and other #growth names, and more gains/outperformance from defensive/#value stocks. You can, and should, position accordingly IMO!

878 2018-11-19 18:06:11 The communication services sector will likely see some interesting M&A during the next six to 12 months. Valuations are attractive on legacy names and secular trends remain favorable as FAANG stocks reflect tempered growth prospects. $CBS $VIAB $NWSA $FOXA $PSO $SJR

898 2018-11-19 18:00:02 Loved Joe Theismann on The Halftime Report today. He’s bullish on airline stocks, specifically Southwest and Delta, and the cannabis industry. I’m aligned
899 2018-11-19 17:59:45 so long as the next low is well above the last low ($200 in 2015), hard to call the death of this  saucy asset class. But it is a growth asset, make no mistake, and growth stocks are being killed. It'll be back.
900 2018-11-19 17:59:42 The best stocks to get are the stocks in the cannabis market

Investor/Speculator here.  I look forward to sniping any trade hints you post sir! Currently watching #CGC and #INPX
904 2018-11-19 17:57:46 #stocks in the #publicsquare should be brought back.
905 2018-11-19 17:57:30 It's great not having to "force trades."  If you have to look for it, it's probably not there.  #stocks
906 2018-11-19 17:57:23 Ouch. $MSTY stocks crash 45% after pivotal trial of #backpain #neurostimulation system missed primary endpoint. No statistical difference between sham and treatment. But CEO insists firm will focus on +ve long-term therapy response. What will the FDA say at pre-PMA meeting?
907 2018-11-19 17:57:12 The $NDX is already oversold, going into a holiday, so I wouldn't count on lower lows in FAANG stocks

913 2018-11-19 17:55:45 Cannabis stocks are being dumped.  The bulls on the sector are saying it's time to load up. I have been writing about the similarity with the BITCOIN scams. Buyers of these stocks will need to smoke the product to ease the pain of losing their money.
914 2018-11-19 17:55:05 Stocks are falling. They need a level head to even them out.

918 2018-11-19 17:52:58 #cnbc you would think media would hire some bloggers to do actual research instead of beating faang stocks day after day to everyone boredom
919 2018-11-19 17:52:35 It did! Thanks so much.. options brings way more than stocks for sure
920 2018-11-19 17:52:30 Quite a few stocks have already broken their October low. This creates an easier path for the broad indices to do the same, which would line up with historical trends of market weakness.
921 2018-11-19 17:52:12 giving her the masters would literally plummet their stocks?? it would not be a smart business move on their part at all so it’s understandable

929 2018-11-19 17:49:38 $spy fwiw... growth stocks are good as long as they are in uptrend. FULL STOP.

935 2018-11-19 17:47:27 That's the least of Apple's "Issues"! What about their new BENDABLE iPads? What "genius" came up with that "Redesign"?

Add in Trump's Borrow & Spend, with Soaring Housing Prices & Deficits, Stagnant Wages, Rising CC Debt, then Artificially Inflated Stocks aren't looking so good!
936 2018-11-19 17:47:26 In crypto and forex in general it is unrealistic since no desk is after you in paper. For high liq stocks it's maybe OK.
937 2018-11-19 17:47:17 Why are people buying stocks on these dips... Don't they know a FED hike is coming, and stocks are going lower?

950 2018-11-19 17:40:27 This is disgusting.We need to stop vilifying the words that’ll give us a better quality of life, like healthcare for everyone.Single payer. Socialized medicine.These are not ‘bad words’ but lifesaving words. It’s greed that stops us from having it.Stocks’d go down for big pharma.
951 2018-11-19 17:39:16 We all hate that guy who randomly mentions that he invests in stocks every now and then
952 2018-11-19 17:38:19 The best part is apparently she had like 20k in savings and another 50k in stocks/bonds and just lied about the rent thing. Gotta act like you’re a regular person so people will donate more 
953 2018-11-19 17:38:05 I dumped all my stocks 2 months back, this has never retraced on a monthly time-frame.
954 2018-11-19 17:38:00 This can be done faster. The economy is soaring correct? The stocks are the "highest ever". Who owns the majority of the stock in America?
955 2018-11-19 17:37:54 Morning Guys!! Today is black day for Share Market + crypto.. Many traditional stocks 20 - 30% down

958 2018-11-19 17:37:23 You've probably heard it before: When it comes to investing in stocks, it pays to stay the course.

966 2018-11-19 17:35:14 Way too much - just listening to you guys on Half time report. This is a correction and everyone knew we were due. Now is the time to start buying great stocks that are now on sale - this will turn.
967 2018-11-19 17:34:58 I would like to agree with you, but then Curaleaf, Acreage, and Harvest should be red as well? Just very interesting how these pot stocks move individually

984 2018-11-19 17:30:46 Also the secret to making money with investments is to buy stocks low and sell stock high.  Summarize: buy low, sell high.  You’re Welcome.
985 2018-11-19 17:30:29 you know let's stop their land route supply as we did earlier in 2 weeks their stocks of Diapers for their soldiers ll b depleted 2 the level that soldiers ll refuse 2 go in combat operations as it happened
986 2018-11-19 17:29:49 So you’re saying they didn’t have to release that money for banks capacity to lending due to a fall in the pound and stocks selling? Well there’s not more I can say then...
987 2018-11-19 17:29:37 a relatively foolproof way to identify a financial bubble that's about to pop is when really dumb people you know start evangelizing for it. 

happened with stocks in 1998, housing in 2006 and bitcoin in fall of 2017
988 2018-11-19 17:29:37 Most twisted part of the silly Gilded Age nightmare is that FAANG stocks took on the mantle of somehow still standing for the high growth leading edge of tech. They're not. They're almost all past growth but are dragging $QQQ into their tar pit cause they haven't been quarantined

998 2018-11-19 17:25:35 @KatherineRooss I am down to only three stocks and my gold.  If we truly are full blown Bear, do I just hunker down and await recovery?  Amazon and Microsoft aren't going anywhere.  Stay the course?
999 2018-11-19 17:25:14 More so stocks. My crypto is growing and I’m going to continue that but my shift with focus on companies with share prices that are more affordable so I can get more of them and let them grow overtime.
1000 2018-11-19 17:25:11 Suddenly no one owns Apple or any of the FANG stocks.
1001 2018-11-19 17:25:05 I am more concerned about tech stocks, peak daggara 9 lakhs (4.5 lakhs ki konna) undhi oke stock lo, ippatiki 2 lakhs out, can only sell in December due to company restrictions.

1002 2018-11-19 17:24:46 Tariffs are driving the stock market down , while increasing costs on manufacturers keeps them from giving raises and hiring more workers. Stocks are down 1.5%, while the Nasdaq is down almost 3%. No gains for anyone. @realDonaldTrump , do you care?
1003 2018-11-19 17:24:14 @jonnajarian as my old and best client Fred Adler said bear markets are when stocks return to there rightful owners! Nuf said
1004 2018-11-19 17:24:12 Net short is easier. Maybe. Short selling math is tough with rip your face off rallies. Gold stocks will compound.
1005 2018-11-19 17:23:48 Stocks not looking great today. I'll get out my DOW 20000 cap so long.
1006 2018-11-19 17:22:39 If you are going to actively/mechanically manage a portfolio, I find researching & sticking to the same small universe of stocks gives you the knowledge & sense of how the names will likely perform in response to news, events & fundamentals - a better feel for risk & opportunity.

1008 2018-11-19 17:21:41 Not sure, but one red flag is that it has captured the fancy of the non-serious investor, a.k.a. lots of friends/family dabbling in the popular pot stocks using their retail accounts.   Most of these folks believe with all of their might that this is going to be huge.
1009 2018-11-19 17:21:12 I finally got approved by a new broker  I love trading currencies but I can't to start trading crypto, stocks, commodities, ect. Time to fund my new forex account 
1010 2018-11-19 17:21:10 Stocks are cheap? Really? By most tried and true metrics (P/E, Price to Book, Price to Sales),  they are not, especially in a rising rate environment. Future earnings can turn on a dime. GDP up 5 trillion since 09 while market cap up 20. They were cheap in 09..
1011 2018-11-19 17:21:04 Looks like we're getting a Black Friday sale on stocks. I will be picking some more up this week for future, old me.
1012 2018-11-19 17:20:43 Exactly. Its crazy what happens. Whenever stocks drop I get so many people who do exactly what I say they should not do then they need help. I cannot help people who lose money in this market doing what I say not to do. Drives me nuts.

1024 2018-11-19 17:16:14 $VXX until its sustaining over $37.5-$38 still looks like it might be forming that right shoulder on daily. This pattern works more in volatility than in does in stocks IMO. Retest down near $32.5 if rejection here.

1030 2018-11-19 17:13:52 When stocks lose 10-30% in value in 30 days we ask this #POTUS: why aren’t your “stimulus” plans sustainable? We’re now buried in mountains of debt w/no #US trade deals of merit, nothing from this weekend’s #Asia summit, bailouts needed, layoffs happening. This is “great?”

1038 2018-11-19 17:11:32 Most twisted part of the silly Gilded Age nightmare is that FAANG stocks took on the mantle of somehow still standing for the high growth leading edge of tech. They're not. They're almost all past growth but are dragging $QQQ into their tar pit cause they haven't been quarantined
1039 2018-11-19 17:11:19 Market casualties everywhere:  FANG stocks getting crushed.  FANG is this generation's Nifty Fifty from the 1970's.  See what market did from 1970 to 1982, and one will have an idea of future market for next 10-12 years.

1168 2018-11-19 16:25:45 Anyone currently buying Canadian oil & gas stocks deserve to get smoked! This is the dumbest thing anyone can do. There is no storage capacity in oil or gas! We are at max capacity! Liquids is what companies want right now!
1169 2018-11-19 16:25:41 Stocks traditionally do well in Thanksgiving week, with the S&P 500 up 75 percent of the time for an average gain of 0.6 percent since 1945.

It may say a lot if it’s wrong footed.

Bitcoin is your friend in this noisy world. Only if you knew! :)
1182 2018-11-19 16:20:32 There has been a rotation from momentum.  I would expect this to continue as you see quality stocks hitting new lows causing selling of winners and buying of quality losers. #momentum #quality #value

1189 2018-11-19 16:17:56 I notice the bond performance is not majorly outperforming stocks at all because the Fed interest rate hikes are driving market sluggishness. This is a far more bullish and bearish sign for stocks. Recession warning signs are attracting bonds in anticipation Fed will have to cut

1197 2018-11-19 16:13:30 Nah, I invest mainly in growth stocks.  They expect to get weekends off.  They also take off Good Friday and expect half-days before many holidays.  They also don't do much in the summer.  Pretty much just Oct to March they work.  Lazy bastards!
1198 2018-11-19 16:12:53 What is the intuition behind that? I would argue that lower stocks lead to recession leading to fed easing leading to lower dollar.

1296 2018-11-19 15:40:27 I currently have 1.2% of my portfolio in cash... so no trade for me! I would just be giving money to my broker ;-0 hahaha! I might sell some shares of other stocks to buy more $NTR though
$AAPL worth about 15% of my portfolio, that's more than enough!

1302 2018-11-19 15:38:56 You need to distract from the economy. The stocks keep going down but all you say is the economy is great.
1303 2018-11-19 15:38:51 TRADE: bought $BABA 150c exp 11/30 at 4.85, this is a very strong ticker today and if there is any support or bottom at all in the short term/ intra day, this is going to jump nicely. #options #stocks #trading #income #MondayMotivation
1304 2018-11-19 15:38:09 Every financial market has a cycle

The average price decline during a Bear market with US stocks is approx -43%

Bear markets have lasted between 3 and 34 months

The other broad stages are recovery then bull

Follow the cycle, and you have nothing to worry about long term

1349 2018-11-19 15:25:42 They actually rose for the first time in years, so they aren't stagnate. They are rising. I dont blame people for hypothetical scenarios. The stocks are doing fine because of tax cuts AND reduced regulation. Stop hoping for us to fail just so you can blame your President. SAD!
1350 2018-11-19 15:25:35 I would attribute it to some lingering effects from Friday's option expiration. Not unusual for "normal" stocks. Of course, $MDXG is not normal. Probably time to short more common. I did.

1360 2018-11-19 15:22:07 At my job this summer I wasn’t allowed to sell or trade stocks to avoid going to jail for insider trader. So I hadn’t really looked at my portfolio in a while, I just looked anddddddd

1364 2018-11-19 15:20:45 Really hoping we have at least another 6 months of flat or even down prices for #uranium #stocks. Investment wise could be the best opportunity I've ever seen. Could be life changing don't want to waste it
1365 2018-11-19 15:20:06 The stocks its possible to value on earnings like AAPL GOOGL and FB all trade below market multiples ex cash. Harder for me to value AMZN NFLX etc
1366 2018-11-19 15:19:54 Crypto Market is 80% are 18-34 year olds.  NONE have seen a crash in stocks that persists for a long long time at least not with any real capital. $BTC is not a safe haven (yet, maybe one day) but its got ALOT more room to go lower. One of worst crashes I seen in BITCOIN here
1367 2018-11-19 15:19:48 yeah pretty much. To get her masters from Big Machine she’d have to pay hella because it’d make their stocks plummet. She owns all hers from today on now though
1368 2018-11-19 15:19:47 Stocks that run up huge will fall quickly so it's not about chasing, wait for the trend to change before shorting. Better to be a bit late than too early
1369 2018-11-19 15:19:21 stocks are weaker than @HFBondsTrader in an opium den?

1372 2018-11-19 15:18:32 Later or sooner it might happened. Re-positioning from big tech’s stocks is new normal. It doesn’t mean Facebook will less margin, but investors don’t want to wait for years to see these facts. It’s going lower for some time and will go up later
1373 2018-11-19 15:18:05 Stock market opened up time to sell my stocks they already vested
1374 2018-11-19 15:17:54 Yep. And to this day, the @PeterSchiff 's and @fleckcap 's still think that this is a free and fair capitalist world and are still buying gold mining stocks.
1375 2018-11-19 15:17:24 Some investors have been moving into shares of energy companies, lured by the firms’ strong earnings growth and cheap valuations, as they aim to diversify beyond some of the big technology stocks that led the recent stock-market rout.

1380 2018-11-19 15:16:28 Stocks yield 8%/yr on average.
I agree stocks make the most sense if your runway is decades on length.
1381 2018-11-19 15:16:04 What the wall street hierarchy(fund managers collectively not supporting stocks at all), agenda-minded investment groups, financial press(many) and general press (with political emphasis) with complicit propaganda, have done to the markets this year...2008 crimes, near repeat
1382 2018-11-19 15:15:39 The hardest part of options trading isn’t getting the direction right, but knowing when to sell. A huge gain can disappear in seconds and it’s easy to get greedy. For this reason, I recommend setting a sell price from the start, AND STICKING TO IT. #options #stocks

1396 2018-11-19 15:10:43 Regardless, it proves my point: the 20% of investors owning 80% of the stocks will make big money, while the rest of us investing their 401K money will just eek out a decent retirement. 

And 50% of us have no money in the market; doomed to work until death.

1398 2018-11-19 15:10:13 There's an investing monster who extends this beyond being directly short Vol. Being long or levered long in stocks only is a short vol position.

1426 2018-11-19 15:00:30 Well, the answer depends on what stocks you have. But it is common to invest in stocks unhedged so when GBP drops, the stock value in DKK terms drops. (This tweet should not be considered as trading advice or a recommendation)

1498 2018-11-19 14:39:43 It's certainly a play with lots of potential, but still tied to the whims of government. It's cheap but in a crowded space of other cheap TSXV/CSE stocks down 75% or more in 2018 and more senior oil plays like CPG also down a lot. All depends where you feel best putting capital.

1557 2018-11-19 14:15:03 Those stocks collapsed because you bet big on Quebec regulations...and failed. Maybe the new government signals better times for them, maybe not.

1559 2018-11-19 14:14:43 Disagree.  Folks are 78 & 80, one with an iPhone the other with an Android.  Both with an iPad and Netflix.  They navigate just fine, making on line purchases, trading stocks, sending email, text and use Facebook.  Your “dumbing” of elderly is unwarranted and inaccurate.

1589 2018-11-19 13:58:43 I have seen almost no commentaries about the effect of share buybacks on the EPS. Apparently most people have it figured out and that is the reason stocks are getting pounded that are showing increase in profits but lagging sales.
1590 2018-11-19 13:58:19 @realDonaldTrump Trump has already crashed the US stock market (given that AMZN bubble out there), most stocks have fallen at least 20% so far (AAPL, GS, NVDA ... etc etc. )

1600 2018-11-19 13:53:27 Why does Wall St. freak out so much about slightly higher rates? I've been buying stocks since August 1982... rates were 20% and the market took off. And rates have been higher throughout most of the stratospheric rise since then.

1624 2018-11-19 13:34:21 Currently own both stocks, but this call is way off. Trials not even in same patient population, no biopsy data etc. Cross trial comparisons are bad enough in similar patient populations but one was NAFLD & one NASH for pete’s sake.

#Stocks now are struggling because it's now obvious that - with a very high percent of current workers now nil-paid, incomes near-flat - soaring stocks simply is unsustainable and a bubble.
1631 2018-11-19 13:27:34 Riight?? I’m happy they still had stocks of that design since it was my favorite one. Wish I could buy more though. Haha 
1632 2018-11-19 13:26:16 1|Oil 2018
The journey to 2023 is starting from a relatively comfortable place. An overhang in global oil stocks has all but disappeared and oil prices have recovered. The oil price rally has rewarded those taking part in output cuts and has also unleashed a new wave of growth
1633 2018-11-19 13:25:27 Making alpha if you: 1. went into cash early and still net above water on a rolling 12mo, 2. arbitrage small caps between illiquid exchanges, 3. went in on selective opportunities and flipped on the pump, 4.   hold tech stocks as a macro story, 5. hold early VC in coinbase etc

1638 2018-11-19 13:23:21 As a follow on to this, US soy bean futures have started to slip in the last few days.  The slip has only been about 1% so far, but the drop in value of the USD has limited the slide .  If/when international investors cash some profits from their stocks, there could be trouble.
1639 2018-11-19 13:23:05 we could have a modern version of the stocks with useless tories lined up for water cannon practice, make it a charitable event soak a tory in need

1644 2018-11-19 13:20:17 The basic international index hasn’t beat bonds for 30yrs:

MSCI EAFE Index = + 4.9%

Tilting to small/value stocks has been the only way to earn a premium:

DFA Int’l Value Index = +7.1%
DFA Int’l Small Value Index = +8.2%

Overall: -2.1%

So losses limited in a difficult month. Stocks down 8.6% using VTI, 7.9% w/ SPY. A 60/40 portfolio of SPY & BND (-0.5%) down 4.9%.

1696 2018-11-19 12:51:23 Greek Bank Stocks Hit More Than 2-Year Low as Debt Concerns Grow
1697 2018-11-19 12:51:18 Stocks are a wealthy man's game, Democrats and the MSM are making sure the divide grows stronger. Without a successful middle class, there is not enough trading to sustain growth. Poor stays poor, middle class struggles under tax oppression, who can afford the risk?
1698 2018-11-19 12:51:06 More money can be lost in a bull market than a bear. How? Bear fear  makes one sells all, but has some cash. In a bull one gets greedy, goes on margin and losses all upon corrections. Then swears off stocks and missed next up leg.
1699 2018-11-19 12:48:10 Well ironically Strauss small gold stocks below cash backing are very rare because as we know small goldies eat cash for exploration , and in this market many close up shop for a while .

You need ounces in the ground in this environment.

1701 2018-11-19 12:44:13 The growth impact from supply-side tax cuts do not “fade.” If the Fed hikes 25 bps in Dec, the federal funds rate will still be roughly 2.5% below trend nominal GDP growth. This is “not” tight. Profits and the economy are not peaking.  Stocks are cheap.
1702 2018-11-19 12:42:43 Currently we have extremely bearish trading conditions

It could go on for quite a while I suppose but the way stocks are behaving says that traders are expecting things to get a lot worse.

Well it's factored in now isn't it.
1703 2018-11-19 12:42:12 Companies were one of the biggest buyers of #stocks in Q3. S&P 500 companies (of those reported so far) spent a record $194.1 billion on share buybacks in the 3rd quarter. Up from $190.6b q/q and $129.2b y/y. #buybacks $spx
1704 2018-11-19 12:41:20 I don’t think you get a higher GDP number than the pre tariff channel stuffing we saw last quarter. Housing has rolled over and big tech has peaked. He one positive is that 2/3 of global stocks are already down 20% so you can argue this could be a bottom.

1713 2018-11-19 12:35:20 So should we just like rebel? Is this how rebellions start? Because it doesn’t feel like a rebellion is about to start but it also doesn’t feel like one isn’t. This feels weird. At the very least could we put Nadine Dorries in some stocks and throw old veg at her or something?

1740 2018-11-19 12:11:08 Respectfully Disagree with you here ... Jesse Livermore , George Soros , Michael Burry , Joel Greenblatt ,John Paulson , Paul Tudor Jones and many more built lot of wealth through trading markets and shorting them not through going long stocks.

1742 2018-11-19 12:08:23 The majority of stocks that got hammered during the GFC recovered their losses within 1 - 2 years. Timing is always key in cyclical markets, but if you can afford to ride out the storm good times will follow for the patient.
1743 2018-11-19 12:06:56 It’s something to do with stocks and Wall Street. I don’t remember all of the details.
1744 2018-11-19 12:05:38 A sharp decline in the value of the pound & plummeting bank stocks sends a clear message: a chaotic Brexit will plunge the U.K. economy into recession.

1747 2018-11-19 12:04:54 Correct. That's why here in Texas property owners are armed, loaded and ready to shoot on sight any of those hoards coming onto their properties. And yes, many have 'bump stocks' on their rifles.
1748 2018-11-19 12:03:09 I think the overwhelming fear of "jank" in the smash 4 community stems from the 2 stock mindset. Our format on stocks has so slanted how we view risk reward than any tiny variance, like a moving smashville platform, is a source of anxiety.

1756 2018-11-19 11:56:44 It's extraordinarily difficult to recognise value when stocks are in the doldrums and going down.

- #Stocks trade 10-4xM-F = 30 hours a week

So stocks only trade 17% of the time. 

Crypto is literally 5.6x more hectic!
2148 2018-11-19 05:00:52 Do you not understand that the companies are literally investing in themselves which makes them stronger to hire more people and provide wages (or something a lot of people don’t mention- those employees own stocks in those companies 401ks IRAs etc.) smh that’s good stuff

2157 2018-11-19 04:51:24 Referring to me? I hope nobody makes a buy or sell based on my tweets without doing their own research. I just point out chart patterns I find interesting or show potential movement one way or the other. Also usually stay far away from penny stocks - too much manipulation.

2253 2018-11-19 03:14:55 If you're starting out, my suggestion is this - create a list of 15-20 stocks that have solid fundamentals. People who buy shares regularly can pitch in with suggestions. Buy these shares in small quantities whenever the price goes down.

2275 2018-11-19 02:52:15 Calm down. Keep your guns, sleep with them if you really love them. The rest of us are talking about rational reform, background checks, close the gun show loophole, require mental competence, and restrictions on things like bump stocks.
2276 2018-11-19 02:52:12 Or that regardless of whether the economy and growth is strong (bullish for stocks) or if things are slowing (bullish for stocks since Fed got you) it’s always bullish? Ratings.

2313 2018-11-19 02:06:09 Bump stocks are a joke. I’ve never even seen one. A false bogey man. Magazine capacity: another joke. 1) Criminals don’t obey laws 2) If they did they just carry more mags. See how reality is?
2314 2018-11-19 02:05:06 I think some future difficulties for OEMs are priced into their stocks right now as well. They would be valued higher if market was betting on their future more confidently. Valuing early Apple based on Nokia/Moto didn't work either.

2353 2018-11-19 01:22:00 Then the 08 bear was mild for them and most stocks did not see the 09 bear. Something like that could be playing out here. As severe as this current bear appears (long duration and persistence) it only has middling losses ignoring smallcraps, not multi-part yet statistically).

2369 2018-11-19 01:04:42 Sincerely, you should stop getting your economic analyses from places like ZeroHege and Von Mises.  They are marketeers for gold and gold funds: they claim that the dollars and stocks will collapse at any moment now, and try to convince you that gold is the only hope,
2370 2018-11-19 01:03:18 Oh yes, we dumb surfs know nothing and therefore should be sent to the stocks for even thinking about putting a pen to paper. Heaven forbid we have a creative streak without our masters to guide us.

2374 2018-11-19 00:58:46 Furthermore the 1992 reaction to a major environmental calamity was insightful, industry immediately turned to decimating new lucrative species and look where crab and shrimp stocks have ended up. I don't think NL really learned the lesson of Cod.
2375 2018-11-19 00:55:17 Market capitalisation in the stock market is the valued by the nr of shares x the share price. The difference between this and crypto is that the money in stocks is actually invested capital, I.e the market capitalisation is the total amount of money invested into that company.
