39 2018-07-18 23:20:33 When a biznessman becomes a politician and unexpectedly lead a country, everything turns to winning and losing, employing or firing, stocks or bonds, progressing or retrogression, people and ideas.

41 2018-07-18 23:18:55 .@ItsChadillac after some tough runs last evening on the dirt surface. Was back at it again today and scored a p3 in street stocks and a p4 in late models at the famed Eldora Dirt Track!
42 2018-07-18 23:16:07 Lots of new members growing stronger
43 2018-07-18 23:15:23 Damn that sucks. What stocks do you currently have shares of?
44 2018-07-18 23:15:04 @amazon is known to screw over there employees. I got fired 10 days before my stocks vested intentionally and was treated like trash for months at Quidsi. Thanks @JeffBezos for screwing me over!
45 2018-07-18 23:14:24 The economy is booming? By what measure? For most folks, incomes are falling. 

Sure, stocks have gone up since you made it so easy for corporations to buy back stock with tax breaks - but that doesn't "trickle down" to the average worker.
46 2018-07-18 23:13:45 They buy it first. So sell something you don’t own at time, once it’s sold, turn around and buy it to sell to person and deliver before deadline. That’s not illegal. Short selling in stocks. I suspect not what you’re referring to though. If divorce related likely fraud.
47 2018-07-18 23:11:13 Lol that wasnt from the tax break, in fact corps laid off and used excess money to buy back stocks
48 2018-07-18 23:09:47 Are any of my followers educated in buying stocks and available to discuss something? Dm me 
49 2018-07-18 23:09:11 Besides, even China might face deflationary pressures from such a crash as real estate and stocks will be hit hard (financial deflation) and struggling companies might lower their prices thereby neutralizing the inflationary effect of the devaluation

53 2018-07-18 23:02:45 Canadian stocks were sold.  PERIOD
54 2018-07-18 23:02:16 which.. wait for it... helps the "haves" a hell of a lot more since they are much more likely to own stocks than the "have nots".  And then add his ill advised trade war which has already cost real US workers (many who voted for him) their jobs.
55 2018-07-18 23:01:57 Home Building stocks are down 35%. Steel up 40%. Lumber up 20%. These are a leading indicator of a recession. We will be in a recession in two years. Republicans don’t know wtf they are doing....
56 2018-07-18 23:01:08 You can have mad bricks, move serious weight...but none of that matters if You ain't investing proper in Your own future.
Them stacks won't last long, I overstand da hustle...been there done that back in the day, but now I'm strickly stocks status and 401k 

Word is Bond...Peace
57 2018-07-18 23:00:47 That’s an amazing ride !! I’m gonna print out a picture of it and hang it next to my computer. When I stay up late studying stocks and chart patterns or when I wake up early to study the market, the picture will remind me that hard work and determination pays off!!
58 2018-07-18 23:00:17 Which is primarily non-US stocks, right?
59 2018-07-18 23:00:15 Those Hillary Clinton no’s are literally a better investment than a ton of stocks
60 2018-07-18 22:59:50 Probably. Any publisher with sense has got to know that picking books to publish has a lot of guesswork in it, rather like picking stocks. And many publishers have a clear idea of the kind of book they want, so if that's not yours, well...

63 2018-07-18 22:58:37 Stocks are surging because companies are buying back shares with their tax cuts. They are not passing tax cuts to employees in the form of higher wages.  Trickle down does not work. It always blows up into a recession. See Reagan. See Bush.

68 2018-07-18 22:56:32 Too bad wages are not only stagnant but falling. You bastards cut taxes for your wealthy donors, they buy back stocks and pay slave wages to their employees forcing those employees seek government assistance. Then you cut the social safely nets too. FU
69 2018-07-18 22:56:02 Anyone that is still
Supporting the NRAs Agenda to block common sense gun reform , block the sales of assault weapons and block the bannning of bump stocks is the sellout .
70 2018-07-18 22:55:17 Nice. That is kind of what I half expected so perhaps I am beginning to understand this shorting gig a little better after all lol

Do you set any hard and fast rules on average daily trade volumes for stocks? ie. minimum liquidity etc?
71 2018-07-18 22:55:14 This week I held my trades too long instead of taking a fair profit I wound up taking a loss.  I didn’t trade today .. taking a few days off to study and review my mistakes. Stocks were in play and I got a little greedy 
72 2018-07-18 22:54:52 @alykhansatchu Hi, I need financial advice, I have some ks. 40000 lying around and wanted to invest in the stock market in the long term. Which stocks would you recommend and how will I go about it. Thanks in advance.

92 2018-07-18 22:45:21 These are the 9 stocks in finance sector that yesterday reached all-time highs:
$TRU, $UBSH, $APO, $AXP, $ICE, $RLI, $SPGI, $UCFC, $CBRE
93 2018-07-18 22:45:19 No she’s a dipshit if she literally thinks he has $150 billion in the bank  she doesn’t realize it’s called stocks. She can go from $150 billion to $20 billion in a day and she has no idea 
94 2018-07-18 22:44:57 Much embedded #risk because of this. How should #investors approach #equity exposure in the US, and specifically to #technology, when there's this much concentration? Be careful and know what you own, especially for #passive #funds and #ETFs. #Investing #Diversification #Stocks
95 2018-07-18 22:44:16 how would we know if stocks are super-efficiently priced? or wildly inefficiently priced?
96 2018-07-18 22:43:24 @RudyHavenstein @JeffBezos Just buyback stocks with free cash flow ... Win-Win. Too the moon. <sarc>
97 2018-07-18 22:40:12 @andyholloway @FFHitman @jasonffl when evaluating, do you guys ever use the stock analysis where you look for value & growth stocks? VALUE are guys that are undervalued relative to ADP/projected finish & GROWTH are ones that should outgrow their current projections in-season.
98 2018-07-18 22:39:46 We have an armistice with North Korea, technical at war.  Why we got about 20000 troops over there.

Economy is stalling out due to the tax breaks for corps as they buy back foriegn investors stocks.  Coupled with the trade disputes that money isn't coming back.
99 2018-07-18 22:39:36 More lies.  Wages are down, inflation is up, corporations invested in their own company stocks, not the workers. If you have 3 dogs, 1 hotdog & hand it to the closest dog, do you think he/she would share?
100 2018-07-18 22:38:53 Another half truth from a $TSLA bear. With volatile stocks like this bulls make money, bears make money, only pigs (esp of the short variety) get slaughtered.
101 2018-07-18 22:37:38 I can see why you'd think so, but the leaves are completely different. As long as you like it! A rose by any other name would smell as sweet... and that's another indicator - hollyhocks tend not to smell of much and stocks are highly scented.
102 2018-07-18 22:36:40 Pacific salmon stocks are declining despite enhancement efforts. Thousands of fishing families along the west coast are facing financial ruin because the salmon are not returning as they should, there is huge effort in Alaska to figure out why.
103 2018-07-18 22:36:14 It's one of the most popular stocks on Robinhood, if that tells you anything.
104 2018-07-18 22:36:12 Switching from stocks to bonds as you age is required by law!? Loaning out cash when you need cash is so dumb it would need a law.
105 2018-07-18 22:35:41 I think the fact that with each P.R. blunder he made the value of his stocks fell might have made an apology the sensible course of action (money saving strategy).
106 2018-07-18 22:34:17 @Kerberos what’s the thing about high skew and that other thing for confirmation? High put volume in stocks or was it backwardation in vix?

122 2018-07-18 22:19:33 I also think she thinks he actually has 150 billion dollars in his account. She doesn’t understand that majority of that wealth is actually in stocks & not liquid cash.
123 2018-07-18 22:19:24 Lifelock is owned by Equifax, who after allowing 150 million Americans to have their info stolen, waited weeks to report it so CEO's could sell off stocks first. And this admin and congress did nothing. In short, Lifelock is probably working for the president.

126 2018-07-18 22:18:07 Biologically we likely need a moratorium on any commercial harvest of salmon, herring or herring roe to give the salmon and orca populations a chance to recover.

Yes, I remember hearing stories about how people with lots of investments and stocks in properties, real estate, etc. were ending their lives because they went from having a lot to being completely bankrupt, and crushed by debt they couldn't ever pay off

150 2018-07-18 21:59:55 i just get up each morning and hunt for news, whether it be company specific, or in the AFR/Australian... see what offshore markets did, any relevant ETF movements, oil gold copper etc. then make a list of ~40 stocks & watch those between 9:45 > 10am and mentally narrow down list

154 2018-07-18 21:57:09 For drawing fibs on a chart, I use both @thinkorswim and @tradingview. As far as screening for stocks near these critical levels, I use our own proprietary screener.

156 2018-07-18 21:56:14 I looked at this deal, the valuation they went out on was way too high based on even their own financial projections! Priced themselves out of the market to avoid dilution. Doesn't work in a buyers market! #valuation #stocks #marijuana #Deals

160 2018-07-18 21:52:52 Also not to forgot the Market cycles.. points out 2018.. in 2017 all stocks were up 3 to 4 times plus if not more since 2008-09.
161 2018-07-18 21:51:25 #Trump is still going ahead with the very expensive #Narcissist parade in November. It costs $12M. That has to be stopped. #Congress? Sorry, limp dicked #Congress can't even vote to ban bump stocks.
162 2018-07-18 21:51:21 Agree with pretty much everything you said. I don't short stocks, but if I did, this would be a good choice.
163 2018-07-18 21:50:40 Do we believe a lying stock manipulator that is the Gordon Gecko of solar stocks, or do we believe President Trump who sacrificed his booming business interests to save a country from mendacious socialists who cry wolf at every breath? Steyer is the face of cowardice!
164 2018-07-18 21:50:32 And Trump has now removed the banking regulations put in place to protect against another financial meltdown! Why? Because it was hurting bank profits! And what is the main influence behind the stock market boost? Banking stocks.

173 2018-07-18 21:41:21 URA options appear to have a more bullish outlook on URA than the ETF itself.  I also agree w @quakes99 that this ETF will be a 'go to' vehicle for many who will pour into the space.  I like to trade it along with stocks b/c of liquidity and a relatively deep options market
174 2018-07-18 21:40:59 Prosperity if you are wealthy or a big corporation.  You have succeeded in making and even wider gap between the wealthy and the poor.  You have walked all over the working people. The big corporations bought back stocks so they look good on wall street.

177 2018-07-18 21:39:47 Yesterday in my presentation in NY, the mood was that. I reinforced a specific group of stocks and how political uncertainty would not affect as much. There are stocks dependent on processual decisions, others on political decisions. Very subtle to identify the difference.

205 2018-07-18 21:29:21 The problem is that though Bezos is theoretically worth $150 billion dollars, most of this money is tied up in stocks and shares. If he were to suddenly sell $100b worth of them, he would lose all that value because of the sudden decrease in share value

207 2018-07-18 21:28:30 A stock market is not what Zimbabwe needs right now. It is gambling  Poor people and gambling making for an evil brew. We need a vegetable-&-fruit market first. We don't eat stocks or stocks for that matter.
208 2018-07-18 21:28:21 Jeff Bezos took home roughly $82k last year in salary - so you clearly earned more than him. That's not to say that he's not wealthy or that Amazon workers are treated well. However we must understand that his wealth is tied up in stocks and it  rises when the share price does.

214 2018-07-18 21:23:56 A standard conservative strategy is to only see neckline as penetrated once it closes 3% below. I don't always apply it but with a strong group of stocks such as tech it is often wise.
215 2018-07-18 21:23:23 Do your job. Protect our kids. Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the legal age to purchase guns and where exactly are the remains?
216 2018-07-18 21:22:50 yeah that too. One of my main thing over the past year or so has been looking for when the USD finally turns lower. Global stocks, mostly EM I think, will kill US in outperformance. USD mean reversion+valuation spread mean reversion=I want to be long EM

Drury is a negative asset. Estrada and Adams stocks have lowered. Abreu looks like a relief pitcher. The only good one is Frazier 
260 2018-07-18 21:00:25 if not for the press, the US intel community would be nearing revolt.

After that press conf and Trump getting his ass handed to him in Singapore, its clear the buffoon is an ignorant pawn. Sadly many are willing to look past it bc tribalism and stocks are higher

Made from guys who are big into trade stocks and other assets, persuade they are doing anything else.

270 2018-07-18 20:56:40 Double Standards, something tells me with all the changes President Trump made and is still planning on making that they stand to loose a lot of money. Look at our Commerce Secretary, how much is he raking in with his stocks and shares in "metals" from China?

313 2018-07-18 20:22:16 right, the point being it's not his job to sell stocks and give up some control of his company to be Flint's savior that blame is severely misguided
314 2018-07-18 20:21:10 we are the stage of cycle where only thing going for them is a high short float. thats a common theme now. people looking for high short as a pct of float. there is too much liquidity. these restaurant stocks should never have gone public.
315 2018-07-18 20:19:24 Slow day on stocks for me. Landed one quickie on $MTBC and another one on $CPAH , but gave it back to the market trying to play silly little setups later on in the day. #daytrading #cherrypoppin

317 2018-07-18 20:18:00 What things are you looking for now, vs. waiting until after-hours & pre-market to see the actual gaps? Is it just to get general awareness of what stocks might gap/be in play, or are you looking for anything specific?

322 2018-07-18 20:16:46 So it’s not being part of an Index #etf like $ivv that is causing stocks to go higher?
323 2018-07-18 20:16:18 Stocks were up today on the back of the fact that stocks are in uptrends and that’s what stocks do in uptrends, they go up.
324 2018-07-18 20:16:07 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your phantom limb syndrome

326 2018-07-18 20:15:05 I agree that all SKEW indicators have zero predictive power for the direction of stocks/volatility. Taken collectively, and combined with measures like VVIX, they can be indicative of the demand elasticity of options in a selloff, and thus what to expect of VIX in the crunch. IMO
327 2018-07-18 20:15:00 An 80 point gain for the Dow was a 5th consecutive day higher and the 10th out of 12 trading days this month as July is living up to its "best month for stocks".

387 2018-07-18 19:30:27 Even in a day when wood has been replaced by plastic as the furniture (stocks, etc.) of choice for firearms, breech and barrel are still made of steel. And no consumer-grade 3D printer puts out forged steel.

390 2018-07-18 19:28:07 Kills me to see people continue to invest in the graveyard of dead money stocks. Not surprising to see though. A lot of people benefited from the ‘free money market’ and believe the old plays will inevitably return to prior highs. Hope those people clue in sooner than later.

478 2018-07-18 18:38:16 Howard Marks: The one thing that should be highlighted about ETFs is that they are conspicuously concentrated in the same stocks. When things go boom and people want to sell, who is going to buy those ETFs? #DeliveringAlpha

526 2018-07-18 18:11:26 On several occasions in the last few weeks, PM stocks have rallied (or not fallen) in spite of falling PM prices. Some say that that is a sign of a bottom — but I’m even less of an expert in these matters...

565 2018-07-18 17:47:58 yeah this is a bit of a strawman. I'm not comparing investing in Magic vs picking the best winners of stocks, I'm saying that for someone with a good knowledge of Magic, they could easily make better picks than they would if they put their money elsewhere

639 2018-07-18 17:17:37 I think big companies haven't seen PE contraction,contrary have seen PE expansion. Life time highs for some big companies suggest there is appetite for these stocks as they have captured market share from small and mid caps that has resulted in greater earnings. Gap opens up wide

644 2018-07-18 17:15:09 Did you know? As of 1Q 2018, there were 33 alternative trading systems (all operating as #darkpools) trading NMS stocks, accounting for approximately 11.5% of total trading volume. The SEC voted today to adopt heightened regulatory requirements for these ATSs.
645 2018-07-18 17:15:03 Can you please please pay more attention to the west coast before we end up like the east coast. If the fish stocks are so bad that it requires a sport fishing ban it is unacceptable to allow commercial and FN fishing. DFO needs a collective slap in the face. Get this straight.
646 2018-07-18 17:14:17 The VIX curve is normally sloped (meaning future expected VIX is higher than current VIX) historically a positive sign for stocks. (The VIX represents an estimate of the 30 day implied volatility of the S&P 500)
647 2018-07-18 17:13:40 Other analysts in my class: Let me max out my contribution to 401k and buy stocks!

652 2018-07-18 17:11:31 I think I've found the holy grail of investing - bonds. But not just any bond. I'm following the @Stansberry Credit Opportunities model. Bonds that have been beaten down unreasonably by the market, but very likely will pay off in full. Super returns at much lower risk than stocks

693 2018-07-18 16:50:56 It all comes down to why you're investing and I wouldn't presume to give you investing advice. For me, it's simple. In my active portfolio I want stocks that have a strong balance sheet and are generating a healthy FCF/ Enterprise Value yield. I don't look at "beating the market"

710 2018-07-18 16:43:57 Surely it is immaterial whether the outcome was affected or not ( who could really know). The issue is that Electoral Law was broken. Simple as that. Hang the culprits by their thumbs or better still use the Stocks! 
711 2018-07-18 16:43:46 I add it up that we are fucked. Things get that bad it will eventually go off big time. They created anger, mental health issues in their thousands and poverty and no aspiration yet again for another generation. They are traitors Eddie, id have them in stocks.
712 2018-07-18 16:43:37 WFC is a strong sell. I only like BAC.

Why are they not creating jobs and making more product?
because they know there is no money to buy said product because wages have been stagnant, job market has been stagnate, there is no velocity of money.

734 2018-07-18 16:34:42 Do believe that FAANGs will be the last to go if/when we enter a sustained stock market correction.  During 2007-08 bear market for stocks, AMZN held up until mid August 2008 - and then it lost an astonishing 60% by December of that year.
735 2018-07-18 16:34:40 hope this one will work out as many think - but you never know what will happen - all stocks are kinda gamble since we do not know what really going on to our stocks until news hit.
736 2018-07-18 16:34:35 Agree, Corporations are buying back stocks at levels not seen since just before the Great Recession. When your disastrous trade policies come home to roost in the coming months, it's going to be hard to pin the tanking economy on Hillary's email server or the last administration.

739 2018-07-18 16:32:58 Perhaps, or you buy back stocks so that stock price goes up so that shareholders and employees largely compensated with stock have more money.

1055 2018-07-18 14:30:55 Markowitz's definition of risk/excessive diversification and all his MPT is most irrelevant in real Investing. Infact , less diversification (10-15 stocks) is key to success in Investing, something what I have observed. Also real risk in Investing is not vol but poor profits.

1167 2018-07-18 13:54:23 Thetax cuts have spurred lack luster job growth, allowed companies to buy more of their own stocks to wrestle control away from the 99%, and have resulted in an insane spike in deficit (and will blow out debt out of control). This is not a good thing. #FuckTrump

1202 2018-07-18 13:42:51 Your tax scam bill only put money in the pockets of the 1% white wealthy elites. They used that money to buy back their stocks at inflated prices to make their corporations look like they're worth more than they really are worth. Tax gains were not passed down to working stiffs.
1203 2018-07-18 13:42:43 Given that stocks are positive ~65% of the time at 1-yr intervals and 75% at 5-year intervals, that likely sacrifices a lot of potential growth that might be needed at a future date. That tactic is a solution in need of a problem.
1204 2018-07-18 13:41:36 Not really. Chart is terrible, news gave it .04 at most two days ago. To buy is to hope, and hope is not in my strategy. Cash is king for stocks actually moving today. Thanks though.

1237 2018-07-18 13:27:41 No one has a goal to “match inflation” for anything longer than a short-term goal. Drawdown risk on stocks is vastly overstated if you have a few years of spending in s-t bonds to ride out bear markets.  See my recent tweets w/retirement sims since 2000. > bonds = > drawdowns
1238 2018-07-18 13:27:41 You're afraid of US-China trade war, of eurozone breaking up. You're afraid that your stocks are going down in value but then, you let the inequality widen.

1355 2018-07-18 12:22:59 Sir, in humble view do not think the correction in smallcaps is becasue of ltcg. Stocks that are not showing growth in top and bottom lines, questionable corporate governance and high levels of debt are falling. The bull market in small caps began post Aug 2013 and not 2017.

1381 2018-07-18 12:05:37 Jusqu'à épuisement des stocks ;)
1382 2018-07-18 12:04:38 THE GOP MADE MOST OF THE AMERICANS SUFFER ECONOMICALLY & THEY HAVE GIVEN EVEN MORE MONEY TO THE TOP 2% WEALTHIEST IN AMERICA THAT OWN HUGE CORPORATIONS THAT ARE USING THEIR TAX BREAK TO BUY BACK STOCKS NOT TO CREATE MORE JOBS & HIRE PEOPLE THAT NEED JOBS!
1383 2018-07-18 12:03:02 Have we met? Do you know me? I doubt it. It’s a hobby, not a job. I have about 20-25 other stocks and some macro newsI follow closely. They just aren’t so fun to tweet about.
1384 2018-07-18 12:02:51 Or the beginning of more capitulation on the mid caps. The next 4 weeks may be very bloody for  stocks that are not lower than 52week low or lowers.
1385 2018-07-18 12:02:42 simple maths actually...a good stock can go from 100 to say 500 whereas a bad stock can only go to 0 from 100 ...also only 200 odd stocks to choose from in f&o....hence happy to be a bull whenever markets allow ! :)
1386 2018-07-18 12:02:37 Better off for who? The wealthy? It’s not better for average Americans, most of whom do not own stocks. Your GOP tax plan rewards the richest 20% who receive 65% of the benefits in the GOP tax plan.
1387 2018-07-18 12:02:32 As in Trump was President yesterday, is our President today and will be our President tomorrow.  Stocks are at an all time high, we hear nothing from Isis any more and job rate for all people is at an all time high.
1388 2018-07-18 12:01:27 The tax cut to the rich could have went to this instead of "more jobs", oops I mean them just buying back their stocks to artificially increase their value.
1389 2018-07-18 12:00:42 Nice counter. The CFP is designed, among other things, to prevent over-fishing, and keep fish stocks healthy. Leaving it should not mean we're able to fish more than our previous quota. Either way, financially ruining the nation is hardly going to benefit fishermen or farmers.
1390 2018-07-18 12:00:40 Who did they buy the stocks from, oh right, the PEOPLE who owned the stocks. That includes investment plans like 401K. Do you have a retirement plan?
1391 2018-07-18 11:59:46 It used to be the promise that Tesla blessed tow companies would all keep stocks of wheels so they could come visit you and put one on.
Is your impression this service has now fallen away?
1392 2018-07-18 11:58:34 First we will enable the tokenization of bankable assets like stocks or bonds and, potentially, at a later stage non-bankable assets. Whether we will also make crypto currencies such as Bitcoin or existing "ICO tokens" available, is still open.
1393 2018-07-18 11:58:23 Oh les gentils labos sont en rupture de stocks pour le vaccin pour enfant anti-tiques en plein été. C'est bizarre ils n'ont pas anticipé ?  Ça rapporte pas assez la maladie de Lyme ? Vraiment heureusement ils ont des stocks des 11 vaccins anti maladie de la précaution.

1395 2018-07-18 11:54:01 While one may argue that the rally is skewed towards a few good stocks. There is no taking away that confidence in Indian equities comes from faith of FIIs FIs DIIs & retail Indians in Modiji.
1396 2018-07-18 11:53:54 It was HillaryClinton who is soft on Russia. @realDonaldTrump didn't sell our uranium stocks to Russia that now turns that uranium into plutonium with which the threat of nuclear Russia has greatly expanded.
1397 2018-07-18 11:52:36 Start investing in bleach stocks. Once that is seen you will want to really get that out
1398 2018-07-18 11:52:13 It is not included but major chinese stocks are down for more than a month so FXI.
1399 2018-07-18 11:52:05 You are wrong, Mase.  The tax cuts should have been targeted to the middle class, not the upper class.  "[t]he top 20 percent of Americans owned 92 percent of the stocks in 2013. Put another way: Eighty percent of Americans together owned just 8 percent of all stocks."
1400 2018-07-18 11:51:21 If we exclude the market cap of top 10 stocks, the remaining over 4,000 stocks listed on BSE have lost a whopping Rs 16.70 lakh crores since January 2018!  More than 300 stocks have fallen anywhere from 50% to as high as 90% from their one-year high prices

1407 2018-07-18 11:42:23 Listen #TraitorTrump there have always been more jobs than people to fill them. The problem is the rich people you gave tax cuts to didn't invest in people, they bought back their own stocks and are too cheap to hire full time or increase wages! You blew up the deficit for what?

1411 2018-07-18 11:39:45 May be more awareness of financial assets coupled with higher growth in stocks. Also increased awareness through different medium lime paytm etc

1415 2018-07-18 11:34:05 I try to bring attention to stocks that aren't talked about a lot. It seem my feed is crammed full of Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netflix daily. But some of us don't have that kind of money to throw around! Good luck to everyone today!

1421 2018-07-18 11:31:19 That's great but when are the employers going to start offering a livable wage? They are using the extra money to buy back stocks. Your cut is and always has been for big business. #TraitorTrump
1422 2018-07-18 11:30:49 His company hasn't lost 2billion because of that tweet, don't talk out your ass. It's stocks had dropped slightly and has since then picked back up to what it was previously. So again, don't talk out your ass.

1425 2018-07-18 11:30:18 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

** U.S. Stocks point to a slightly higher open amid corporate earnings, data.   JP Morgan surges 3%

** European markets soar on earnings; Ericsson rises 9%

** Asian stocks close mixed as dollar extends gains after upbeat comments from Fed's Powell
1426 2018-07-18 11:30:10 Events in Helsinki only serve to reinforce that President Trump’s actions on trade will be driven by poll numbers as the mid terms approach. Tariffs are popular with the base but US stocks will suffer as heightened rhetoric becomes policy. Broader tariffs = lower stocks.

1442 2018-07-18 11:15:43 Unemployment is low which is awesome but we have a disproportionate amount of part time jobs. Your wealthy buddies aren't offering full time and benefits. They are busy inflating their own stocks with tax savings.
1443 2018-07-18 11:14:24 My stocks are down in the last six months. Real wages are down 1.4% since your inauguration. The very rich are doing well though so I suppose that’s all okay then.....

1491 2018-07-18 10:30:59 Something to ponder in my vague ideas for a small project on the siting/size of similarly 'public' sites; stocks and archery butts for instance. 2/2
1492 2018-07-18 10:29:59 Those near retirement should not invest in developing/emerging economy like China w high growth & risk. Should stay w stable develop market like USA & Germany.  Or to bonds or even gold etc. stocks is for long term.  Can’t win in short period bec of market fluctuation.
1493 2018-07-18 10:29:43 Key is that plant yield stocks like #PHC have failed to make meaningful in roads (see thier last results)..farmers would be much better concentrating on water and moisture controls to improve yields via @crop_x @glr_1990

1511 2018-07-18 10:12:10 So far, corporations have bought back a combined $700 billion in their own stocks, artificially inflating their values (and the stock market), and real wages have dropped about 1.5%. This is only a good thing for the very rich, who will be protected from the coming crash.

1549 2018-07-18 09:37:45 “Great investment opportunity” is an odd description of a vehicle that shares all of the downsides of both penny stocks and precious metals. Illiquid, manipulatable, storage risk, counterfeiting, low volume, no distributions, etc... Also unsure why lack of regulation is positive.

1588 2018-07-18 09:00:36 One unchanged set of stocks does not a market make. Also, don't take the credit yourself if you have a broker managing a portfolio for you. Again, look at 10 years of the Dow. Steady increases until 2018, then relative stagnation. You are a unicorn, don't take that for granted.

1606 2018-07-18 08:44:49 I am not invested in multiplex stocks but food coming brings it's own issues. But like I said let the market decide. Getting the Govt in means corruption and another licensing. Now will there be rules to define the type of food allowed ?
1607 2018-07-18 08:44:14 Scan all the IPv4 addresses and find vulnerabilities, is very similar to some trading strategies, which scan all the stocks and look for patterns.  The Internet is so fast now to achieve the goal (also thanks to the novel, powerful scanning tools).

1619 2018-07-18 08:33:17 i don't understand when market go higher then few stocks don't move (e.g. NALCO, ANDHRABANK) but if market go down then these go down with it. what the hell kind of bullshit is this? @ZeeBusiness @CNBC_Awaaz @kotaksecurities @hdfcsec @zerodhaonline @moneycontrolcom

1622 2018-07-18 08:32:08 2018 may prove worst for investors holding stocks of mid-cap & small-cap in their portfolios irrespective of when they purchased the stock.

1623 2018-07-18 08:31:21 The problem for IC & Shares Mag is that the journos by the nature of their work, probably get through 50% of the markets as “recommendations”; simply goes with the territory. I imagine they would be sacked if they stuck to recommending the same 20 quality stocks for 2 years!

1863 2018-07-18 04:34:10 As a economics major there should be classes on stock trading and market analysis, but nooo GSU wants me to take Astronomy,  the starts and planets are not going tell me what stocks to trade.
1864 2018-07-18 04:33:01 You’re a traitor and no amount of tax breaks or rise in stocks will change that. You can’t buy America off to look the other way from your TREASON! And the penalty for Treason is Death or Prison, choose!
1865 2018-07-18 04:31:44 "The economy is souring. Job growth has slowed compared to the last 5 years of the Obama Presidency & stocks have experienced the worst half-year since 2010. Wages are stagnating and healthcare costs skyrocketing. Trump's trade policy has more losses than wins."

1875 2018-07-18 04:19:21 He made some great points but then doesn’t it also underline the fact that if you buy good mid caps at cheap valuations you can make good money? Don’t you think this ongoing correction will present such opportunities provided you can get the right advice and identify such stocks

1892 2018-07-18 04:04:34 Agreed save for the date David. Collapse not until 2020/21 imho. Crash this fall will be short-lived, a 1987 V-type crash, forcing #Fed to flip back to #QE quickly, sending stocks to a final blow-off top ~4k S&P imho.
1893 2018-07-18 04:04:10 $fb and $googl are the only sane priced stocks in fang. If you profited from amazon and Netflix, you have to take some profits. Trade them if you want, but the drop in those two will be mind boggling when it does happen.

1900 2018-07-18 03:56:35 Just because you’re a former congressman doesn’t mean you have a brain. What @Ocasio2018 said made perfect sense. Unemployment rate, like stocks or GDP, tells you nothing about people’s real lives.
1901 2018-07-18 03:56:02 This just can't be good for U.S. stocks right? Stronger dollar and rates increases. Does the Fed want a crash?
1902 2018-07-18 03:55:06 But there stocks are going to be plummeting, so they obviously are going to be having issues with their shareholders soon

1913 2018-07-18 03:39:08 To be frank, I’m more worried about someone continually making money from stocks in an industry that needs serious reform in order to work for Americans and keep us alive, than someone who worked as an independent financial auditor once for an organization I disagree with.
1914 2018-07-18 03:38:51 STOCKS TO WATCH: RALLIS INDIA, NUCLEUS SOFTWARE, ZEE ENTERTAINMENT, SINTEX INDUSTRIES, PNC INFRA, KRIDHAN INFRA, TEJAS NETWORK, TCS, QUESS CORP, KANSAI NEROLAC, TRIGYN TECHNOLOGIES, M&M FINANCIAL, HDFC, CRISIL, JINDAL STAINLESS, TATA SPONGE, DR. REDDY’S:

1919 2018-07-18 03:36:32 Mostly cash right now.  Played a nice few swing trades on $TSLA on the long side.  Waiting for a good entry in $YY and some other Chinese internet stocks once the noise is over

1921 2018-07-18 03:36:24 After 2014, Gotze, James, etc stocks rose too and we all know how that went. Personally, I am tired of the hype given to WC as CL is even more competitive. You can't just use 7 or less games to determine player's stock.
1922 2018-07-18 03:34:39 Sen. Smith may not be insider trading, but she is certainly benefiting from owning MILLIONS of dollars in medical device stocks while she tries to “regulate” the industry. Whether it’s legal or not, it is unethical and corrupt to be making money off the laws you pass.

1985 2018-07-18 02:46:25 I'm glad snake's mine got removed. If you're streaming friendlies and look at chat between stocks it's easy to not pay attention to where the mine is placed and then you might step on it like an idiot then get made fun of. A unique dsmash isnt worth the emotional damage

1993 2018-07-18 02:43:11 I will post a link to the debate very soon I hope.  Remember that I was assigned a debate position, but I argued that green C is subject to reversals (wildfire for example can wipe out forest C stocks) and in the case of ag, very hard to maintain & scale broadly.
1994 2018-07-18 02:41:50 I need to learn more about stocks and invest in some
1995 2018-07-18 02:41:20 Wages are stagnant and jobs list .1 or didn’t you see that. What happened to you touting the stock market? Let’s see in 2 months when unemployment is up to 4.5, wages drop $1.00, stocks struggle and you are censured.
1996 2018-07-18 02:40:35 Stocks or commodities?
1997 2018-07-18 02:40:08 Seems like you don’t know how stocks work
1998 2018-07-18 02:39:35 Stocks?  Bonds?  Baseball Cards?
1999 2018-07-18 02:38:27 The point is,  profits are the losses of new traders, and thus the retail trading industry exists to bring in new capital and then take that capital legally in the market. The smaller the stocks, the more direct and transparent this is.

2025 2018-07-18 02:28:59 According to IBD, "Even though the Nasdaq is at a new high, the S&P 500 index at a five-month best and Dow Jones up in 8 of the last 9 sessions, breakouts by top stocks have been scarce. That makes it hard for investors to take advantage of the confirmed stock market uptrend.

2034 2018-07-18 02:25:47 Frankly it somewhat depends on the amount of funds. Either way I’d steer clear of banks. Choose a firm that will manage the money w/ individual stocks/bonds or possibly ETF’s. I’d be happy to recommend some firms to you that we recommend. After all we do have the same name

2042 2018-07-18 02:19:00 @DPB_Teacher Interesting time! Nifty reaching higher points and mid/smallcap are far from high. Should we buy them?

I'm buying quality stocks in small quantities.

2050 2018-07-18 02:14:45 Technology is leading to far greater business disintermediation than in the past hence many of today’s value stocks have secular issues as opposed to cyclical pressures
2051 2018-07-18 02:12:45 If you follow me you know I prefer to scan stocks and take a position before the action happens rather than chase a trade. I’ve been burnt so many times chasing trades before so I try not to do that

Do I think someone should force him to? No.
And actually, the main problem is that his value isn’t cash, his value is stored in company stocks that he owns. Not usable as currency, and he would lose Amazon if he sold.

2059 2018-07-18 02:06:43 Good work, now I do not believe those inversions had QT and the amount of debt there is now, plus the idea that EVERYONE is talking about it makes it certain that the inversion will definitely not cause the downturn in stocks, we’ll see...
2060 2018-07-18 02:05:00 Oh please, I'm not disputing the importance of the stock market or that institutional investors own most of it. He talked about "our wealth," as if is the only measure of what is obviously a much larger national asset base than just stocks. Did you read the thread?

2064 2018-07-18 02:01:50 Pro tip : It's incredibly difficult to trade stocks trading at RM 0.95-1.00 levels within a contra period (4 days minimum).

2070 2018-07-18 01:56:43 This kind of discussion isnt out of the blue. Talks ab BH has been circulatin since last yr when the IPO news dropped.

2082 2018-07-18 01:47:20 I’d be happier if I had a position in equities. Unfortunately, the GOP is running, & ruining, America. I worked for nearly 50 years. I live paycheck to paycheck, like many taxpayers, & rarely buy stocks because I like to eat.

2088 2018-07-18 01:44:24 if you know nothing about stocks, copyrights, management, etc stop pretending like you actually do. i see managerarmys or whoever else quoting bs articles off of google without knowing what they actually mean and yall sound dumb asf.

2090 2018-07-18 01:43:02 I think BTS deserve at least 51% of stocks. 
We all know the customers are buying for BTS, not Bang family!

2093 2018-07-18 01:42:49 Yeah.  Invest in "real" assets that are stable like "real estate" and blue chip stocks. lmao.
2094 2018-07-18 01:42:13 Not worried about SPY. As long as we are in an accumulation market, I don’t care about the index action. The weekly watchlist of what I consider leading stocks and candidates that I build every Sunday is the most reliable tell I have. The health of those charts is my guide.

2097 2018-07-18 01:40:40 That;s a fallacy, particularly more so in crypto given how directional it is. Not so for traditional markets as well. Just look at the Trump Train of 2017 for US stocks and other assets. Brexit and cable. The ECB's QE and the euro. And BTC did not offer any pullbacks from 6300.

2104 2018-07-18 01:34:49 Being worth an amount, doesn’t necessarily mean that all that amount is available to you in cash. A lot of that is in stocks and assets that won’t be available until they’re liquidated.

In the end of the day, it's just money, i really hope BangPD is not that greedy. Hope he has conscience. 
BTS deserve at least 51% of stocks in Bighit. 
The whole Korea and whole World know that BTS alone is Bighit's cashcows!

2155 2018-07-18 01:04:47 Read a story about a womens investment club who put stocks on the wall and threw darts to pick the ones to buy. Their success was just as good as the professional investors. Makes you wonder sometimes how much effort to put in making decisions.

2167 2018-07-18 00:55:28 Save your breath on this one Lorrie. He cant comprehend the stock options were part of his $6 million salary pre the June election. They aren't "costing" anything now. The dollar amount of the stocks was recorded on the books in respective years earned.
2168 2018-07-18 00:51:24 Thus trading is simply wealth redistribution, and the "Trading community" exists to pull in fresh blood to provide liquidity in the market (especially penny stocks).

2193 2018-07-18 00:31:50 Seems like the definition of “efficiency” has become muddled. More noise in trading now but cost is way down. Stocks repricing to new info much faster IS efficient though feels the opposite to some. “Inefficient” then becomes  code for “not what i’m used to”
