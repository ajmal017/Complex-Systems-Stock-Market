Sounds selfish & entitled. #kidsdeservebetter we’ll stay #cfbc
1 2018-10-10 23:24:08 They don’t have commodities in the mix (particularly energy commodities as inflation hedge) that has been the savior for other risk parity funds including perhaps AQR. But these things are a QE created monster and will fall with QT
2 2018-10-10 23:22:20 Known commodities vs draft percentages and immediate impact to flip the season are worth thinking about
3 2018-10-10 23:21:13 Não sei o que o cara escreveu pq tô bloqueado... mas c/relação às exportações, em países essencialmente exportadores de commodities é sempre bom ter cuidado, especialmente em países tão grandes como o Brasil. Se as exportações são mais interessantes, como fica o consumo interno?
4 2018-10-10 23:17:40 How about neither? If YOU ever traded this is a correction off ATH, just saying. 2-3% swings common in commodities but that doesn’t sell headlines...
5 2018-10-10 23:17:38 That's because there's "No Flight to Safety" anymore (other than perhaps crypto currencies). When they created ETF's (Exchange Traded Funds) out of Bonds and Gold (precious metals) they effectively linked the equities markets to the commodities markets.
6 2018-10-10 22:59:55 Colombia desperately needs PhD holders to spear R&D, otherwise it is going to be very difficult to switch from commodities to an economic model based on knowledge and innovation.
7 2018-10-10 22:59:03 The new labour spent on the production and the relations of commodities, it becomes the money commodity, or serves as money.
8 2018-10-10 22:56:00 Yes commodities like #coal. How good is it for #agriculture? Does almost as much damage to the environment as industrial scale #monoculture cropping.

10 2018-10-10 22:47:15 That’s still dirt cheap for those three, it’ll  never be cheaper.  The Mets should invest heavily around those three or trade them immediately and start a rebuild. But they won’t do either and Jeff and Fred will waste valuable commodities the team won’t see again for a decade.
11 2018-10-10 22:44:43 The criticisms are accurate, but what's the prescription? UBI is an asinine idea. Prices of commodities and housing are NOT dictated by the price to produce, please realize this. The prices are dictated by consumer buying power. With UBI, prices will just increase.
12 2018-10-10 22:43:21 nao vi o artigo como sendo um endosso do bolsonaro, mas sim uma analise. gostei pq dá nome aos bois.
"bolsonaro é autocratico? haddad apoiou uma nova constituinte"
"lula foi um bom presidente? presidiu durante o boom das commodities"
etc

14 2018-10-10 22:36:10 We have a new system to process low grade e-waste to further refine the commodities. We've engineered the system and are utilizing equipment from our our strategic partners, @Erdwich and #Guidetti. We'd love to chat more about it, if you're interested! We're at booth 1406.
15 2018-10-10 22:33:00 Só vejo céu azul no Brasil. Desgraça estávamos há 4 anos, com Dilma reeleita, commodities afundando e horizonte 0.

Vou entrar nesse barco quando ele der uma pequena afundada nos 70K, onde vai limpar até a última sardinha da rede.
16 2018-10-10 22:30:03 If Copper moves above 2.86 a LB.-buy. Until then look for it to fall further. Metals can be helped by a falling Dow & a falling Dollar. I'm undecided on the meat complex & will wait. #Commodities #Copper #Metals #Forex #Dow #Agriculture
17 2018-10-10 22:27:09 This is why I hope to make it on your team some day. You guys are cool and take care of your players. You treat your players and people, not commodities and that says a lot about you guys as a team. Plus your team's skill level is insane. So am a fan! :D
