- banned sort selling 
- had their PPT buy stocks in massive quantities
- urged everyone to keep calm and buy
- eventually banned selling altogether

Their market "only" crashed 60%.

38 2018-12-05 23:41:14 Wow that's great! Yet somehow there a net zero gain for 2018. That means everyone of the gains you show above had an equal fall. 
No one has made any money on stocks THIS ENTIRE YEAR! No wonder the FTC has black listed you.
39 2018-12-05 23:38:47 Ça se voit t’as acheter un faux maillot toi

Les maillots sont en rupture de stock depuis 2 mois et les stocks sont écoulés en quelques heures donc non c’est pas dispo partout
40 2018-12-05 23:38:24 Blind trusts work for stocks. That way you dont know what stocks your portfolio contains after you take office. 

How do you place a hotel or real estate in a blind trust? You know you own it.

Did you really not consider that?
41 2018-12-05 23:38:16 reading about how stocks work so i can annoy elon musk on twitter
42 2018-12-05 23:38:03 The whole world is practically living in a bubble right now. 

Expect stocks and property to begin declining. 

The crypto market (yes, highly speculative) & Forex is my go-to choice right now. Institutional adoption means more confidence for stock investors to switch over too.
43 2018-12-05 23:36:33 Stocks look so safe these days....
44 2018-12-05 23:31:48 All true. ASX tech penny stocks shouldn't be approached as long term investments in general, regardless of geographical origin. There's a longer list of home grown rubbish, and $NVU not reflecting well on Singaporean tech or registers either
45 2018-12-05 23:30:11 Yeah, ok, but how do your stocks look for the year, buddy? Pretty f*cking shitty I suspect.
46 2018-12-05 23:30:02 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing #stocks.
47 2018-12-05 23:28:38 @MarkYusko Love the new bet. Probably perfect timing- deep bear market vs top of stocks.
48 2018-12-05 23:28:35 Definitely!
49 2018-12-05 23:27:46 Since the market was closed... I took Today as a day to research stocks and crypto. #AlwaysLearning #BuildWealth #Abakuas
50 2018-12-05 23:27:11 Learned today that if you transfer stocks out of your Robinhood account, they straight up deactivate your account. XD Chales Schwab it is, then!
51 2018-12-05 23:27:02 True, and you’re right to highlight it but that same risk is inherent in almost any asset class. Property, stocks, PM’s, Fixed Income, Cash, Commodities...
52 2018-12-05 23:26:49 Futures/CFD volume suggests that the latest flash crash on stocks is liquidity hole rather than someone with a fat finger (or combination of both). In any case, we are still in a weak mkt. Valuations do not prefer a huge leg down like 2000 or 2008 but (cont.) $SPX $ES $NDX $NQ
53 2018-12-05 23:26:17 Sure - but (unwittingly, I imagine) the proposal to buy stocks shows exactly how that change could be accomplished even within the current framework. Armed with the power to tax and with eminent domain, the gov't really could make public a big slice of corporate profits this way
54 2018-12-05 23:25:22 Not really. You can watch price action and observe stocks being accumulated and manipulated up, or distributed and manipulate down. Follow the money
55 2018-12-05 23:24:01 How are glorified mini-cab stocks performing?

58 2018-12-05 23:21:29 People's Revolution. 17.4M Brexiteers should grab the putchforks and put on yellow vests a la Francais and march on Parliament and place every MP who blocked Brexit in the stocks.
59 2018-12-05 23:16:51 FTSE100 is at or slightly below Bottom Bollinger Band - this could be support. Exdiv day tomorrow but few FTSE100 Stocks involved. FTSE250 done a nice Hammer although context not amazing - it could try to move up. Support around 18100 now very important. RSI 32 low not extreme.
60 2018-12-05 23:16:37 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your chronic fatigue

73 2018-12-05 23:06:27 I’m not judging it they helped or hurt. I was arguing that corporations have been using the tax cuts to buyback stocks. That’s not a judgment on whether it helped or hurt, that’s a critique of the trickledown argument.
74 2018-12-05 23:05:54 So it’s not a forex pair. You don’t look at stocks?

85 2018-12-05 22:59:22 (and while stocks are private goods, the stock *market* is in a sense a public good - it is a legal framework created by the public to encourage certain economic behaviors. So nationalizing a % of it to fund pubic goods wouldn't be illiberal at all)

89 2018-12-05 22:53:24 I would tend to support your stance. I've never been comfortable with any drive for trial by media driven public opinion. I thought we'd moved on from ducking stools and stocks on the village green!
90 2018-12-05 22:53:17 ECHR is independent from the EU, ECJ only deals with disputes regarding citizens rights and disputes regarding members. Fishing, EU fishing controls saved the UK's fish stocks, fishermen fish till there are no fish left, your government allocate the UK's quota.
91 2018-12-05 22:52:39 Because right now only the few, the smart and rich who have already got out of the market are buying gold. The rest, the average people are still holding onto their FAANG stocks.

93 2018-12-05 22:51:59 The first rule of governance of a fashion is to protect the people from themselves, not starve them and then blame it on them and if food stocks do become low and I mean low, the people will be blamed not the incompetence of government.

98 2018-12-05 22:48:34 No they're not.

Not every group is exactly like the NRA

104 2018-12-05 22:44:55 Oh. You don't know. Sorry. Capitalism consists of converting social goods to private profit. Stocks aren't "social goods." They are one of the means of the generalized oppression of the working class by the capitalist class.

109 2018-12-05 22:44:00 Fed doesn't see it, but the stock market does: US is about to enter a recession. Stocks are not the place to be through the next couple of quarters., especially since investors can earn about 3% in no-risk treasuries. @cvpayne
110 2018-12-05 22:43:35 For that to be worthwhile the stocks would have to actually have value instead of manipulated by tax cuts/rebates being used for manipulation of stock value in the form of buybacks, dividends, etc.
Then it would just be socialism for loses and capitalism for the rest of us...

131 2018-12-05 22:22:05 Collapses tend to occur within 3 years. Study historic bubbles and you will see 70% collapses that happen very quickly. Gold has never gone down below 45%. Also if you value Gold relative to Stocks, Bonds, monetary base, Fed balance sheet, etc, its trading near historic lows.
132 2018-12-05 22:21:12 Fortunately I bought another house and some land last year.  I should have done the same this year but too much land gets expensive to maintain and pay taxes on.  My net worth is currently about 50% real estate, 50% stocks.  Onward and upward.

Soooo..... why didn't it freefall until now? Trade wars been going on for 2 years..... stocks mostly up during that time...…

Oh, wait... sorry... you just repeat the sound bites from CNN.

151 2018-12-05 22:05:10 Maybe Vic wants to give his employees another chance to avg down on the stocks they bought in $8’s and then he will appear and bust shorter’s claims. 

He is showing extreme patience and utter restraint while working on lethal rebuttal.
152 2018-12-05 22:04:33 Still can't believe 'Stocks' is a pre-provided app on the Iphone. Who do you think we are??

157 2018-12-05 22:01:48 I think I agree with you. It would be ok if ALL charged people were named but it does feel like selectively choosing people for the stocks based on a whim rather than justified by analysis and need.

163 2018-12-05 21:59:16 There are people out there right now looking up which of these two stocks has a lower P/E ratio before making their choice.
164 2018-12-05 21:57:59 It's because stocks are in bubble territory & they are getting ready to collapse!!!
165 2018-12-05 21:57:27 1/4 For God’s sake, I really wish PETA would just stop with all of this now. I used to support them but they seem determined to throw away what little credibility they have left. And they’re making all vegans and vegetarians look like laughing stocks by association.

173 2018-12-05 21:49:24 Why do you care about how many purchased the game? Do you own EA stocks? If you're concerned about the future of Dice and the series...that I can understand. 
I wouldn't say "attacking". They were mocking the armchair historians and it was really bad choice for marketing.
174 2018-12-05 21:46:45 #AEA President Cathy Koeheler #LREA President Teresa Gordon and #NEA ExecDir. John Stocks all financially backed Baker Kurrus not @FrankScottJr for Mayor of Little Rock. Yet another example of just how out of touch they are. They bet on bad horses with dues money too!
175 2018-12-05 21:46:38 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your chronic fatigue
176 2018-12-05 21:45:19 Why is your company in the shitter, stocks dropping like crazy.
177 2018-12-05 21:45:03 I'm not talking about goods and services inflation. I'm talking about capital inflation. Financial asset inflation. That's where the inflation of the money supply in our credit-based economy goes. That's what has caused the unprecedented run in U.S. stocks.
178 2018-12-05 21:44:26 Delaying my stocks over nothing 
179 2018-12-05 21:43:34 Because Wall Street owns the stocks and bill bonds the Federal Reserve sold to Wall Street in order print money. So now when the stock market goes up. The Federal Reserve has to pay back bankers on Wall Street.
180 2018-12-05 21:43:08 Best dividend stocks?
181 2018-12-05 21:43:02 Thx James, sorry, I don’t discuss stocks that I like.
182 2018-12-05 21:41:49 We use malt at 0.2 - 0.5PPM and malt at 45 - 55PPM and process them seperatley. We only produce heavily peated for a small period of the year and we mature the stocks seperatley. Couldn’t specify exact ppm levels of the final dram but the term “lightly peated” hopefully suffices.
183 2018-12-05 21:41:28 He always talks about stocks in regard to how many burgers you can buy later, so he does talk about purchasing power.I think he calculates that he can make more dollars to make up for debasement.
184 2018-12-05 21:40:16 Every time their stocks goes up means more money they get from the federal reserve. Since wall street owns stocks and bill bonds, the federal reserve sold them in order to print money. So now every time the stock market goes up.

188 2018-12-05 21:35:36 I am discussing the future of Earth and its climate, not just stock futures. It seems all those who are against renewables only care about stocks and profits in short-term.
189 2018-12-05 21:34:10 what about inflation "then risk with stocks is much worse" and any currency or dollar only
thanks
190 2018-12-05 21:33:40 Stocks slide as bond market sounds a recession warning
191 2018-12-05 21:33:26 Maybe, I have no idea, but I think showing a chart starting from the literal market bottom to convince people that stocks only go up is fraud.
192 2018-12-05 21:33:13 Howard Co. #Nebraska #cattle on stocks not leaving too much of a mess yet.
193 2018-12-05 21:32:59 Taxes are paid when stocks are sold, if you make a profit. Nothing happens when the market goes up or down. 46% of the US population has no stocks. The richest amongst us only (top 10%) own 81% of the stock markets value. Stop using the stock market as a gauge of the economy.
194 2018-12-05 21:32:41 Stocks drop because of Fear! Specifically fear of higher interest rates. Smart money knows that higher rates will cut leverage investing $.
195 2018-12-05 21:31:46 How come you don’t think? It is tempting to thing that it would be perfect right? Make nice calls on stocks. Sell some $DIG bags here and there. He doesn’t do penny stock but sh**coins. I always wondered why.
196 2018-12-05 21:31:18 Yep, @brmilo96 maybe check Chinese stocks before making such comments.
197 2018-12-05 21:30:47 Run ya stocks
198 2018-12-05 21:29:38 The day I decided to check my stocks..... the market is closed
199 2018-12-05 21:29:16 $JKS and $CSIQ both seemed like undervalued stocks setting up for a big explosion in thin same sector. Definitely on watch for longs(especially with a nice spy day)
200 2018-12-05 21:29:11 I think Trump having a (weak to me) deal with Xi is gonna pump stocks for another year or so. I see the doom coming between 2019 after the European elections and 2020. A stocks crash is gonna pop all the other bubbles. Curious to see the btc halving effect combined with th crisis
201 2018-12-05 21:28:34 Savills didn’t do too badly ... up almost 50 times over a 20 year period.  My favourite of the half dozen or so property stocks ...
202 2018-12-05 21:28:30 You’re on the right track but from someone who trades stocks all day, here’s how I saw it. Of his dinner with Xi, Trump said it,  “was an amazing and productive meeting with unlimited possibilities for both the United States and China”. The market (naïvely) accepted this at face
203 2018-12-05 21:28:06 I'll make sure the stocks are nice and splintery for ya in the Railyard.
204 2018-12-05 21:27:58 How many of you dabble in stocks? How many of you are interested in stocks? If I had a referral code for a stock trading app would you use it? Just curious.
205 2018-12-05 21:27:00 OMGAAAAADDDD!!!

Whilst I've been busy decorating the Christmas tree - Younique have announced 25% off ALL Royalty Skincare Range But only whilst stocks last - some things have already SOLD OUT so be quick ladies!!!

EEEEKKKSSS - I'm off to stock up on masks
206 2018-12-05 21:26:17 My stocks are tanking and I heed to figure out more business expenses before taxes are due.  When’s your next life coach business session?
207 2018-12-05 21:24:20 I think it's a bit more complicated than this but essentially yes except you forgot they also "short" stocks meaning they make $$ when it's going down too. Best thing is to stay long on good companies and ride this out. They all make money every transaction people.
208 2018-12-05 21:24:18 Available stocks? Mga nasa 800~
209 2018-12-05 21:23:56 Nobody knows with certainty.

210 2018-12-05 21:22:23 Ever wonder why you don't see much discussion of quality stocks on HotCrappa?
$LBL e.g rose 40% yesterday on REAL news but barely a whisper on Crappa.

No paid company operatives & no Sophisticated's heavily trying to pump the SP up to make bank on mug retail is the answer
211 2018-12-05 21:19:49 Yes. Current weak share prices of resource stocks are not in any way related to the industry fundamentals or the commodity prices. Strange times... But an amazing opportunity just now
212 2018-12-05 21:19:26 Don't play the penny stocks.
213 2018-12-05 21:19:18 What else should he tweet for American stocks to rise again?

218 2018-12-05 21:14:07 Bump stocks?
219 2018-12-05 21:13:17 Cop sur SNS, mais je ne sais pas si les stocks sont gros ou non...
220 2018-12-05 21:13:02 Watched your little friend on BNN - thanks for the cheap stocks! Never felt more safe going long! Little creep couldn't even piece a sentence together Hahahaha!
221 2018-12-05 21:12:15 Best thing to do with your crypto money rightnow is starting a business cuz:

-Stocks are topping 
- Real estate is expensive af (will probably stagnage before crashing tho cuz high demand rightnow)
- metals are meh rightnow
- interest is extremely low
- bonds are for girls
222 2018-12-05 21:11:25 Usually love a @NandosUK but the one at the Cornerhouse in Nottingham let it down today. A mixture of poor service, out of stocks and a tough piece of chicken. Not the greatest.
223 2018-12-05 21:11:06 Absolutely. There are many unregistred divers that plunder the stocks and sell to restaurants/hotels in the central belt. Divers also illegally remove undersized scallops from beds anvd place tem in their own “secret” areas of the seabed. Ireland & Manx ban Divers for this reason
224 2018-12-05 21:11:05 I think it’s time for a little reconciliation with the #aboriginal #indigenous #FirstNations and the @DFO_Pacific over #salmon stocks to ensure all people have access to this fishery. #bcpoli #treatyrights #AFN
225 2018-12-05 21:09:26 I want to know your secret.... how did you do it? Our candle stocks make us OK for a power cut everyday for the next 15 years!
226 2018-12-05 21:09:16 BINGO! This is what I've been saying!! Check what stocks, companies and interests these limo liberals and wealthy green nuts own
227 2018-12-05 21:09:07 So. How many so "encripted" sites of crypto stocks was pwowned?
228 2018-12-05 21:08:49 Yeah - referring to himself as "Tariff man" made the stocks weep. Nice that Obama is back on top!
229 2018-12-05 21:08:13 "Jokes on you, Travis, we ain't got stocks or jobs!"

231 2018-12-05 21:06:55 There should be disclosure on every legislator that votes on any 'green' initiative on which green stocks they hold or are shorting.  Legislators have made a lot of money creating legislation and buying stock in companies that will benefit and personally we're damn tired of it.
232 2018-12-05 21:06:32 Finally, Wall Street starts seeing the long obvious.
Soaring #stocks while incomes near flat and many incomes of current workers nil is unsustainable.
GM just finally got Wall Street to see the long obvious.
233 2018-12-05 21:06:32 Right!  I was also thinking of the Bellerophon plot line and pharmaceutical stocks as a way to profit.

235 2018-12-05 21:06:19 In  the huge effect that the festive & extended trading period has specifically to food stocks mean a Dec YE fails to fully capture the benefit to the Co. 
Even Libatar mag’t ADMITTED that at H1 results. 
Most other food stocks PFG, TBS, ARL, RFG are Mar / Sept for that reason
236 2018-12-05 21:05:48 This is exactly what is needed $serious $it $would $make $searching $stocks $better
237 2018-12-05 21:05:47 Due to a customer reneging on an order we have 27 A4 polished black metal frames. Fantastic for certificates. So we have an offer while stocks last. £12 each.
238 2018-12-05 21:05:06 Patience my friend, it's dying a slow lingering death, but like all good sagas the story will run & run. Quite when & who will deal the final blow is anybody's guess,but keep your stocks of popcorn & a cosy chair handy
239 2018-12-05 21:05:04 Gold way safer than stocks, that's for sure.
240 2018-12-05 21:04:25 That’s the problem there’s nowhere local that stocks them which is a pain in the ass
241 2018-12-05 21:03:50 In  the huge effect that the festive & extended trading period has specifically to food stocks mean a Dec YE fails to fully capture the benefit to the Co.

242 2018-12-05 21:03:07 Fact. Fishing up to the MSY rate IS possible for all stocks.
243 2018-12-05 21:03:00 Nope mais des gros blocages avec des gens qui font des stocks d'essence, de conserves et des kg de sucre oui :)

245 2018-12-05 21:02:26 How to Find Home Run Stocks in This Market
246 2018-12-05 21:02:19 Fed is too aggressive, spooks investors, stocks drop.  Fed backs off, yields start to fall, stocks drop. Come on and make up your mind already geesh
247 2018-12-05 21:02:19 Collecting the money from my stocks today. 
248 2018-12-05 21:01:00 Well I’d not say investors buy these when the rest of the market sells off, at least not too much because most of them still go down a bit. Only they go down much less compared to other large caps. Everybody has their own strategy but personally I’d never short such strong stocks
249 2018-12-05 20:59:56 Would you consider putting out a quick trading video just going over yesterday's eventful trading day? Or it's self-explanatory (index damaged, good stocks not). Thanks!
250 2018-12-05 20:59:29 One motive for moving from flies to worms: being able to freeze stocks.
251 2018-12-05 20:59:09 Donald Trump is moving to ban bump stocks. Y’all plan on doing anything about that? You guys played a big part in getting him elected I’m sure you can get a hold of him and let him know that banning bump stocks is an infringement of our second amendment rights.
252 2018-12-05 20:57:20 this is an actual thing you can do if you play izayoi though since her OD builds stocks automatically
253 2018-12-05 20:56:20 Les stocks de bouffes sont maigre ? Tu délires la non ?
T exagères ...
254 2018-12-05 20:56:19 Trump brags about the trade deal with China, resulting in stock market soaring.Then there is no trade deal, resulting in the market nose-diving. #SEC , plz see if Trump family has shorted stocks and profited from erratic swings.

260 2018-12-05 20:50:17 Hello, this item is already released so maybe there is no more benefits unless they have left in stocks.
261 2018-12-05 20:49:01 Hey look @nissan even have a page explaining how their "just in time” management works. " In this way, the amount of cash tied up in stocks and in work-in-progress is kept to a minimum, as is the amount of space devoted to costly warehousing “

262 2018-12-05 20:48:55 Fucking hell Christmas came early for you I'd suggest putting some of that into stocks
263 2018-12-05 20:47:49 In TOS you can see the option’s historical prices, charts, etc. Do you use this or similar for confirmation? This is very interesting and when I DT penny stocks we used the same reasoning.
264 2018-12-05 20:47:29 If y’all drug dealing niggas, & scammers would just take y’all mindset to sell drugs an get money an use that mindset into real estate, stocks an get business minded y’all would make sooo much fucking money. 
Just think about it 
Cause y’all niggas smart but y’all not thinking

269 2018-12-05 20:43:34 A poem should be blooded and revolving
As an appropriated philosopher,

Amino
As shadowy whiskies to the processor,

Glaring as the regal stocks
Of pensive canonizations where the mouthful has undressed--

A poem should be newest
As the tendon of scrimmages.
270 2018-12-05 20:42:41 I've started investing in stocks.  Beef, chicken, and vegetable.

One day I hope to be a bouillonaire
271 2018-12-05 20:42:38 Blockbuster news investors TD  Ameritrade employees are going to testify against the company on their fraudulent Ways on how they manipulate your stock and your options and penny’s stocks account an employee how it is done they have employees in every office around the country
272 2018-12-05 20:41:59 Options the only way to play $apha for LT imo I’m staying away as stocks broken. Trades and scalps will be there
273 2018-12-05 20:40:59 Yea let’s just leave it at that. I work for the company which is what even got me into their stocks to start but hey if you’re making a living off it good for you. You’re apart of the 10%
274 2018-12-05 20:40:45 Na im only laughing cuz its kind of ironic tho
Like, a company with thousands of dollars and they put them in stocks rather than adding them to the paycheck 
275 2018-12-05 20:35:39 that ball may be worth more than my pot stocks now lol
276 2018-12-05 20:35:29 Stocks down today 799 points
277 2018-12-05 20:33:49 Absolutely. I enjoyed the conversation. I’m a small business owner and trade stocks and options. I mainly dabble a little here and there in crypto and like to learn about it. Your knowledge and experience in crypto and digital currencies overwhelmingly dwarfs mine.
278 2018-12-05 20:33:30 @PaulNashDC Good day Dr. Nash, Seems the US is going it alone in the Crimean Sea  sending a carrier, no NATO  plus N Korea building mussels at Hamgyong Mountains + Hoejung-ri  Missal base expansion. Mueller Stocks Down
279 2018-12-05 20:32:37 Bet you own some hidden stocks that are climbing up and making you rich you low life.
280 2018-12-05 20:31:44 @realDonaldTrump Flynn flipped, Cohen flipped, Graham taking a stand on Saudis, stocks plummet, NKOREA building new middle sites, Xi not supporting you.... how has your week been?
281 2018-12-05 20:31:34 How do you spell pot dot com??? Aphria !!!!!!!! The world is finally realizing that pot stocks got way ahead of themselves!

Pm me for link xx
285 2018-12-05 20:29:00 The article is from October, they're owned by Unilever and no, the stocks didn't crash.
286 2018-12-05 20:28:10 Normal business jitters. The stocks took a dip yesterday because of the phrase "tariff man." Investora thought, or think, the trade war is still on. If economic peace has been restored, moderately even, then stocks should bounce right back up.
287 2018-12-05 20:26:19 Why is this excuse for a man allowed out in public without being put in the stocks.
288 2018-12-05 20:25:54 1. Why are ppl smarter with more money buying #Bitcoin? 
2. Why are multi-Billion $ companies creating infrastructure?
3. Who is buying my bitcoin at these prices & why?
4. I can send #BTC to anyone on EARTH, can i with stocks/cash? 
5. WHY is there OTC trading if its gng to 0?
289 2018-12-05 20:25:42 At the rate I’ve been going to Starbucks lately, I should’ve bought some stocks last month
290 2018-12-05 20:25:40 IMO, this expansion was remarkable in that so much of the stimulus flowed into the "asset economy" vs. the "real economy." Hence, the huge run ups in the value of both traditional assets (stocks, housing, CRE, etc) and non-traditional (collectibles, artwork, high-end booze, etc)
291 2018-12-05 20:25:39 Weird, all I've heard is Trump people talking about how great the stocks are and how much everyone is making
292 2018-12-05 20:24:39 @GuyAdami @CNBCFastMoney are Chinese stocks back? What about SQ? Is growth not the way to go anymore!?!
293 2018-12-05 20:22:04 Every company was a startup at one time. I’m sure those people who put everything into Trump casino stocks instead of a safe fund where acting with a touch of greed, imagining getting rich. Hell, many professionals invested in him too.
294 2018-12-05 20:21:39 Sorry to hear you missed out - we increase our stocks dramatically on such offer days, but as you can imagine, we never know exactly how many people will come to store, so these offers are always on a first come, first served basis. Hope you get to try these treats soon Kayleigh.
295 2018-12-05 20:21:27 yes but bitcoin began its climb from $0 while the other stocks began from higher numbers. this chart is unfair.

Let’s see; your Senate is planning to pass legislation to declare Saudi Arabia (including MIB) guily of killing Kavanaugh. 

World markets are TRASHING your China trade policy; stocks are dropping; Mueller is getting ready to drop the hammer!

You’re doomed!

304 2018-12-05 20:12:34 US Futures, Global Stocks Pare Losses After China, "Tariff Man" See Deal
 
S&P futures rebounded modestly from yesterday's furious selloff, rising 0.5% after yesterday's 3.2% drop, as "Tariff Man" Trump said he sees a China trade deal coming "either now or into the future"...
305 2018-12-05 20:11:08 I’m exhausted from changing my outfits to vote, and organizing caravans of disease ridden felonious children fleeing violence in Guatemala.  Whew! But George, keep those checks coming! Because my stocks have been taking a hit.
306 2018-12-05 20:11:02 Those looks like stocks on a gene

312 2018-12-05 20:07:46 @GuyAdami are Chinese stocks breaking out upwards ?!
313 2018-12-05 20:07:22 Can you compare yield vs. Stocks vs. Bonds on the show from 2008 and now.

323 2018-12-05 20:01:50 "2018 Is Starting To Look Historic":The Worst Market Since Nixon
Nothing’s working, large or small-cap stocks in the U.S., not international or emerging equities, not Treasuries, investment-grade bonds, commodities or real estate: this is the worst time to make money since 1972.
324 2018-12-05 20:01:19 1/As I wrote earlier, tomorrow is important. Mercury direct w/ a new moon  tomorrow, and Mars joining Neptune in sextile to BTC Sun should correlate to a trend reversal to the upside. Stocks will be an important sign to watch. Another dump like yesterday would be a bad sign.

2. Pokemon stadium was more jank and had more camping stuff than WarioWare. 
3. The game isn't even out dude. Like WTF?
335 2018-12-05 19:57:15 That’s right. $0.

The problem is, people actually want their money back. No one buys stocks for the sake of having stocks. They buy stocks because they want more money money. And this is why everything Aswath believes is nonsense

347 2018-12-05 19:52:11 When Trump wanted to ban bump stocks, I could care less. I am a #2A supporter! I own a gun, I have a ccdw, and I am the first one to fight back when the word starts about gun control! Those that want one, have one. Criminals won't turn them in! Any gun law will be a catch 22!

351 2018-12-05 19:49:07 Nobody has been bullish about the most hated bull market everrrrrrrr Guy. I know ur point, but the most watch news show on stocks saying “Sell Tech” “Growth to Value” every minute of everyday-what do u think happens? Still luv u though

355 2018-12-05 19:47:12 Yea long term sure earnings go up stocks do (at least that's what's happened so far). I'm thinking more short/intermediate term re:what matters to their value-add relative to other assets. Declining rate of return (earnings) not good if rate of return for cash/ST bonds goes up
356 2018-12-05 19:47:07 They are free to do what ever they like, however there a big marketing forces out there giving very bad education.  People rarely listen but occasionally it makes an impact. I have seen this in stocks for over 30 years. People rarely listen.  Most really have no idea.
357 2018-12-05 19:46:53 That's why redwood, neolib Con spout for ERG and mogg-puppet, eh..?1 Same redwood that told his investors to get their money out of UK stocks ... presumably not because he thought brexshit would be good for UK, yes?! Chaos-capitalists need err, chaos to profit, more the better
358 2018-12-05 19:46:49 Any suggestions on what those avenues may be. We passed a massive tax cut, but instead of creating more jobs, companies decided to lay off workers & used the profit to buy back company stocks! Indeed, long term welfare is bad, but those small communities rely on gov’t benefits.

361 2018-12-05 19:45:19 Good reminders.  And we act like we know what is coming next. 
Greenspan said this at a point where many had already thought stocks were way overdone. His message was not a shock to many and yet the nasdaq tripled since then.....at the time, just impossible to fathom.

377 2018-12-05 19:34:53 For one, stocks are a duration asset. Presuming no unique information on multiple expansion, earnings *growth* and the cash flow therein is what should inform someone's decision to own a stock as opposed to something with a fixed rate of income.
378 2018-12-05 19:34:00 DLTR and WMT come to mind. Solid business results and stock performance during 2007 - 2009 (both stocks were flat / higher with the S&P 500 down 50%+). DLTR and WMT comps were +4% and +2%, respectively, in 2008.

398 2018-12-05 19:25:05 It would be interesting to see that chart vs M2. But that aside, I think retail investors are mostly exposed to stocks via pensions which is not an M1 candidate. It would be very broad money. Thus, the M1 vs stocks comparison is one to think about

406 2018-12-05 19:20:22 Stocks settled at 3:30am according to my eTrade rep.  Meaning my funds should be a-OK to be wired to my title company tomorrow.   Woooo.
407 2018-12-05 19:20:08 In general I'm not an active investor, I don't think you can beat the market by playing stocks. But I also believe in value based investing and today I bought 130 shares of @monzo because I believe they are changing banking.
408 2018-12-05 19:19:55 It would be hilarious if the 9th circuit court overturns @realDonaldTrump 's executive order banning bump stocks.
409 2018-12-05 19:19:17 Question will all gold stocks rise during the recession or will only some?  @PeterSchiff
410 2018-12-05 19:17:36 I'm afraid we won't be able to comment on that because our stocks solely depend on the supplies from our customers.
411 2018-12-05 19:17:27 The guy I buy my coffee from in the morning is all in on weed stocks too. He says buy any weed stock below 3.
412 2018-12-05 19:17:27 Kaya di naunlad Pilipinas dahil sa mga tulad mo ate. Seriously? Like, ate, kahit naman kase san magpunta ang daming stocks ng mga fake or copied products. Then it so happens that poverty has a high percent here in the Phil. Anw, do you even know the reason why they'd bought it?
413 2018-12-05 19:17:08 Ruled they needed to cover another $480B in bad debt, what did China do? Issue more Bank Stock! Then they wonder why financial Stocks are tanking! The debt crisis is Not Here! It’s in China & it is coming like a freight train & will make us SICK! That $480 Billion is NOTHING! 2/

416 2018-12-05 19:14:45 @SagarRV1 hello sagar can I have your portfolio so that I can buy the same stocks
417 2018-12-05 19:14:24 Laredo now has only one store that stocks recent comics and it’s spotty at best. San Antonio, here I come!
418 2018-12-05 19:14:22 For a brief period in time this year I was a millionaire.  Pot stocks give and pot stocks take away.  What I can tell you from that point in time is: I didn’t sleep better, food didn’t taste better, pain didn’t disappear.  I was the same person, only difference was the account.
419 2018-12-05 19:13:40 apple stocks rise by 69%.
420 2018-12-05 19:13:07 Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Michelle! I am not going so far as choosing stocks myself, but I am not automating any money transfer!
421 2018-12-05 19:12:58 Very true sir . Strong believer of the same theory . Markets would always be up given consistent 6% gdp growth and in between that individual stocks can create amazing wealth.
422 2018-12-05 19:12:34 So yeah cash, and hopefully accumulate high quality stocks.  I’ll always hold a little bitcoin, but I don’t have high hopes.  I’m not sure how you grow wealth nowadays, honestly feels toppy af across everything.  But I guess everyone always feels that way? Any advice? Lmao
423 2018-12-05 19:12:26 sort of but knowing how to place and utilize stocks from pack takes at least more skill/effort/knowledge. I'm not claiming I know how to but yea.
424 2018-12-05 19:12:06 I’d recommend buying in small increments and adding on pullbacks but being patient. Staying in cash by buying short term CDs or bonds that now give close to 2.4% (you can buy through your brokerage) could be a wise move so you have the money to pounce on stocks when they’re lower
425 2018-12-05 19:11:37 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
426 2018-12-05 19:11:22 Stocks have no values inherently. Unless a company like Apple or Facebook with hard cash, tengible assets...company technically has no true value beyond cash and assets minus liabilities. Future profits are speculation on the way up and same is true on the way down

429 2018-12-05 19:09:26 It’s over if we actually have a downturn.  But then I think, wait, timing the market is impossible.  So I second guess myself and think I should just hold high quality stocks and accumulate others as they dip.  This will probably be my strategy.  I’m not even close to a fan..
430 2018-12-05 19:08:30 Almost everything is overblown in this society.  Stocks, housing, etc etc etc are ridiculously overpriced and driving an increasingly large wedge between the haves & have nots. Debt increasing by 2 million $ per minute! No generation wants to take the hit of a massive devaluation
431 2018-12-05 19:08:29 1/2 I honestly don’t know.  I currently have 50% of my portfolio in stocks, but ready to raise even more cash.  So I guess I just have a shit load of cash rn.  I’m keen on buying stocks on a dip, but need to think longer term time frame.. think it’ll take a year or two before..
432 2018-12-05 19:08:05 Hummus stocks holding up so no need to panic :)
433 2018-12-05 19:07:35 It’s gonna be bumpy ride for the stocks going forward

439 2018-12-05 19:03:41 I suppose that M1 growth as a basic proxy for credit creation which is essential for economies to grow - no credit/loans for businesses, no growth, no gdp, no stocks market growth
440 2018-12-05 19:03:13 Fuck you George Bush I'm trying to buy stocks today and you're fucking it all up.
441 2018-12-05 19:01:50 Dont buy #stocks when the #economy is doing well, buy stocks when the economy is doing poorly. Exact same goes for #crypto!

442 2018-12-05 19:01:19 Heard stocks are hella limited

452 2018-12-05 18:56:15 Excellent work Cath 
453 2018-12-05 18:55:33 I have to invest in more stocks
454 2018-12-05 18:54:48 Not only did 0% interest rates prop up Obama’s economy, but they propped up the stock market by keeping money away from fixed income investments and toward stocks.
455 2018-12-05 18:54:45 You are right. Obmanation and Clinton are laughing stocks.
456 2018-12-05 18:54:38 Trolls (a common English translation of the Lads' supernatural classification"), & other creatures, were often blamed for diminished or disappearing food stocks during such times. Similarly, 1 of the "motivations" for witch trials was cows not producing milk or livestock dying.
457 2018-12-05 18:53:12 too funny as one central bank after another becomes "data dependent" i.e., we have to see if stocks crater and have to see if commodities move before deciding - remember when central banks used to lead and pave the way for the economy?
458 2018-12-05 18:50:50 I'm a derivatives trader, you don't need to explain it to me ffs
You claimed the "smart money" is leaving the US stock market, it's not, there is just less external investment in stocks.
There is a difference.
459 2018-12-05 18:50:05 My stocks are plummeting! I am trying to stand by the @WarrenBuffett long game method but it’s so stressful to see my portfolio loose so much value. Tips for staying sane during a decline?
460 2018-12-05 18:49:36 Actually, this is very simple... Stocks rocketed during the reign of Republicans and dropped at the loss of the House... now all will flatten and nothing will get done... and yes... Democrats are to blame!!!
461 2018-12-05 18:49:21 Let’s please get modern and get real. tRUmp has major contributors involved in hedge funds (Mercer, Kushner). They profit when the market tanks. It’s hard to make stocks run up, but crazy uncertainty can run make them down. Go figure.
462 2018-12-05 18:48:27 Stock markets recover. That’s what they do. They are controlled by short term and long term debt cycles. When the cycle hits the bottom it has nowhere to go but up. I hate when any president gets credit for stock performance. The Fed has way more impact on stocks than the Pres.
463 2018-12-05 18:47:47 The reason why funko stocks have been taking a hit......
464 2018-12-05 18:47:33 Where are all those people who swore up & down that Hillary Clinton as president would be worst? 

How’s your stocks looking?
465 2018-12-05 18:46:58 You can go poor buying gold. If you bought gold in 1980, and sold it 20 years later, you could buy 1/44th of $INDU listed stocks than you could 20 years earlier.  20 years is not an insignificant time period for an investor. Calling someone 'intellectually dishonest' is weak bro.
466 2018-12-05 18:45:36 Oh Donny Boy, the stocks, the stocks are tanking,
A crash that even Faux News cannot hide,
Midterms are on, and your approval's dropping,
It's you, it's you, must go because you've lied.

Don't come ye back, in 2 years or much later,
Or after Mueller's dealt the final blow....
467 2018-12-05 18:45:28 I just let you know that I am daytrader on options with no overnight.
I just let you know that I am swingtrader on stocks.
I just let you know that I am longtrader on dividends only.
468 2018-12-05 18:45:06 Or maybe he's just manipulating the stock market. Ever notice that when the "Orange Cheeto" makes a threat, Stocks take a nose-dive... Few weeks later when he decides to play nice in the sandbox Stocks are suddenly in the stratosphere.. me thinks Trump's crimes are beyond Russia
469 2018-12-05 18:43:56 Y’all let all des other broke clowns flip ya taxes and ain’t get shit. Time to let me put y’all shit into some stocks. Umma guarantee some
Kinda return shit
470 2018-12-05 18:43:37 My reaction to seeing the stocks this week
471 2018-12-05 18:41:34 I hope anyone who wasn’t fully committed to long term holdings has already sold up.  It’s not nice out there unless you’re a very very lucky (shrewd) investor.  No one has a clue how it will go over time. I don’t buy much at times like these with stocks falling. 

#bideyourtime
472 2018-12-05 18:41:24 Very slow money unless you plow hundreds into it, basically like stocks really. You either go the whole hog or don’t bother.
473 2018-12-05 18:41:10 buying stocks in sment so i can make the dreamies not sad who wants to pitch in
474 2018-12-05 18:40:57 Interesting... Although a ridiculous amount of non-produce items were also out of stocks. I’ll have to check @RedRiverCoopLtd today.
475 2018-12-05 18:38:08 Redwood WARNED HIS INVESTORS to pull money OUT of UK STOCKS (& his ERGwit boss set up funds in Dublin to avoid SM-exit barriers to Services/Capital FoM)...
No, honest voters were CONNED by neolib Cons' LIES about jobs/economy (then DELAYED economic impact via LATE A50+TRANSITION)
476 2018-12-05 18:38:06 One lesson that always stuck with me about investing and stocks... “Never use money you cannot take to the bathroom and flush down the toilet without missing it”
477 2018-12-05 18:37:53 Enjoy your 800 point drop in stocks, you are a joke president
478 2018-12-05 18:36:52 Stocks getting corrected about 55-90% from peak. Index only 25-40%. Power of index management. 
Is there any need for portfolio when the valuations pricey?
479 2018-12-05 18:36:17 Que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonines, que tu me dises que c'est rien
480 2018-12-05 18:35:56 for thos e into stocks sell all of tumblr & invest in newgrounds that the cool kid thing now

482 2018-12-05 18:35:12 It's a shame that Tesco no longer stocks the Teriyaki flavour. It always seemed the most popular flavour at my local store, and then it disappeared. The sour cream and chive one is also delicious, but not available in store either.
483 2018-12-05 18:34:38 Oil companies do not like Saudis flooding the market. Look at their stocks if this continues???????
484 2018-12-05 18:34:23 If you hadn’t asserted that the value of stocks  has nothing to do with income.....
485 2018-12-05 18:33:55 If a boomer has put all their eggs in one rotten basket then they likely they knew the risk. 

This is why you diversify kids. Even the best looking stocks can tank.
486 2018-12-05 18:33:30 And the next time the government comes out and announces that they are going to be the financial backstop for a specific industry - you would be smart to buy stocks in the companies in that industry too! Of the 3 banks I bought in 2009, my lowest return was 180%
487 2018-12-05 18:32:57 Try trading stocks in a jurisdiction where you are unlicenced and see how well that goes for you, or selling insurance, or lending mortgages... A WTO Brexit will be great for the financial services industry - in Frankfurt.
488 2018-12-05 18:32:26 Well I like the stocks but I like other wheels as well
489 2018-12-05 18:32:20 Ektachrome is unbelievable but developing slide is expensive. I like Portra 400 for everyday shoots. I've got two rolls (new) to shoot on this weekend. I'd highly recommend going through r/analog and looking at what stocks people are shooting on.

494 2018-12-05 18:29:48 “Promises” don’t mean “action”. Like that time you “promised” cheaper health care that would cover everybody. Or when you “promised” a trillion dollar infrastructure bill. Or you “promised” an EO to ban bump stocks.
495 2018-12-05 18:29:48 Some people hate themselves, the way they look, the way they feel. They'll do anything to look and feel different. We shouldn't put them on a pedestal or in the stocks. Neither praise nor shame.
But anybody and everybody should be allowed to braid their hair. Bob Ross had an afro
496 2018-12-05 18:29:41 How come? It's simply peer to peer electronic cash. It's Whitepaper never promised profits to anyone. Wasn't designed to be an instrument of speculation. It's as much a ponzi scheme as stocks are.
497 2018-12-05 18:29:06 How much did y’all have in savings before you started dabbling in investing(stocks,bitcoin,RE,etc)?

499 2018-12-05 18:27:32 Sounds like oil stocks are about to make a rebound 
500 2018-12-05 18:27:01 One game I will never understand is stocks  gotta have patience, im a hustla so I always want that quick flip n end up losing out on money !!
501 2018-12-05 18:25:26 If you are going to invest, you need to do some homework.  I too disagree with automatic investing, except through your 401.  I look for undervalued stocks and dump my money into those when the market is down.  Even if it's only a few dollars.
502 2018-12-05 18:25:24 What a shit show out there.  If your not down hard today your up I guess.  Good time to be holding cash.  Tempting to see your fav pot stocks even blue chips at these levels but no sign of reversal confirmed yet.
503 2018-12-05 18:24:58 As a boomer; I have seen republicans screw the stocks many times.

I think conservative media has re-programed boomers historical psychology with beliefs rather than facts so that they will repeat the mistakes of voting for them.
It is there only hope to get elected for the rich.
504 2018-12-05 18:24:44 More likely ammunition, IED stocks, & RPG type artillery. Well done Air force!
505 2018-12-05 18:23:32 You’re naïve. Signals never equal policy. Like when you signaled you’d put a ban on bump stocks then never did.

507 2018-12-05 18:22:40 This country will never be rich. Specially when we have somebody like you in office. What happened to the stocks? I thought you said they was wonderful. All of them are dropping.
508 2018-12-05 18:22:27 Do you do any trading in crypto or just stocks?
509 2018-12-05 18:21:42 And still be able to extract enough edge in the information to justify that cost :), apart from #nf I don't think any counter has that fluid liquidity. Stocks have spiked moves fr other reasons etc.
510 2018-12-05 18:21:16 @Jokrono - insane investment was rife in the 1980s. Just read about the bank of Japan, one of the "bluest of blue stocks," using seances and fortune tellers to determine their investments! So investing in insane shit might just be "what 80s businessmen did" to a Japan audience

512 2018-12-05 18:19:55 You got a love this after-the-fact 2020 hindsight analysis. It is going down because the whole market is going down. Nobody knows where the bottom will be. Yet!   If it is that worthless. Then why is it the number forth crypto by market cap?   Stocks go down as well!
513 2018-12-05 18:19:53 Alright, I'm looking into the possibility of investing in stocks for some $. Unfortunately, I know nothing about stocks: how to read them, know when to cash out, what to invest in based on trends, how much to invest etc. How lucrative is it?
514 2018-12-05 18:19:50 I don't understand why the natural death of a former president at a nice old age means the stock market should be closed, but perhaps I'm a callous turd. #stocks

517 2018-12-05 18:17:10 Presidents control #stocks - to extent that presidential policies on real economy ultimately are reflected in stock market.
In other words, ultimately the "investing class" notices the GMs and the other daily big downsizings of good-wage jobs - that might yield investible dollars

522 2018-12-05 18:16:24 Why cops especially don’t clamp down on firearms is beyond me. Armor piercing bullets and bump stocks and now suppressors in some states are reasons why law enforcement are pumped up to lethal force at most stops or altercations or any disrespect perceived by them.
523 2018-12-05 18:15:17 I agree we are playing a long game. However; China will not sit idle and also try to inflict pain where it hurts Trump voters. So easier said than done! Bearish stocks, bullish bonds, I guess...
524 2018-12-05 18:14:38 Fully agree.. to solve the low stocks issue we need 4-5 weeks in a row of above normal temps otherwise we are exposed to fireworks risks

537 2018-12-05 18:07:11 What's funnier is that few of them own any stocks.
538 2018-12-05 18:07:05 @realDonaldTrump Have you seen the stocks.  Yup, you mouth off when it is good.  But when it is bad you ignore.  You are a fair weather leader.
539 2018-12-05 18:06:34 Are you kidding me? So BNN today and another piece tomorrow? This is a disaster for pot stocks. Wow

541 2018-12-05 18:05:50 The thing is, the vast majority of people don't care about the Dow, because they don't own stocks or bonds, and the effects of the closures and losses in farming haven't spread to the wider economy yet. It's what people feel that they care about, and it's feeling better to them.

557 2018-12-05 17:58:17 Thanks to Trump stocks dropped 700 points yesterday. He doesn’t know a damn thing about business. Never has. Multiple bankruptcies prove it. He just knows how to promote his brand.

560 2018-12-05 17:54:14 America is not bring back manufacturing before the next depression.  Trump is to late
561 2018-12-05 17:53:30 From a speculative perspective. In other words, low priced stocks that may look attractive to larger firms interested in expansion.. like what we've recently seen.
562 2018-12-05 17:52:55 I told u already SELL gains - if u have - on Netflix stocks and buy or what for buy into Disney & Apple .... apple will move into content and video maybe they will buy Netflix in next recession.... $disney mashine! Content is king and disney is king 
563 2018-12-05 17:52:24 Stocks were down, almost 800 points yesterday, because investors knew that this tweet, is just another lie. I don't know why anybody, actually still believes, that you know how to make deals.  Where is the evidence, that you aren't just all talk, and LIES?

567 2018-12-05 17:49:59 So is there any one thing your accumulating - outside of crypto? What are thought there, next year all stocks gonna get hammered? Is there a safe haven? Gold? Anything other asset?
568 2018-12-05 17:48:40 Yes a MAJOR reason for income divide & entrepreneurship decline. But MOST material: FED policy, intended as "wealth effect"for all by creating near 0 interest rates & money super flow, both unprecedented.Result: bonds & stocks shot up to benefit ONLY top 1-5% & not entrepreneurs.

576 2018-12-05 17:44:45 I’m sure they’ll eventually go back up and probably exceed their highs, but for now, they’re tremendously overvalued and I see that them and other stocks have quite a bit to lose still. But it’s kinda fun to day trade with them on the days when they have a little mini-rebound. 
577 2018-12-05 17:43:17 Wait is comp ulmate gonna be 2 or 3 stocks?

580 2018-12-05 17:42:39 #TheView I hope MCCain and  Joy B. Solve their differences cause we got enough with the the idiot in Our House ranting on tweets about every freaking thing that he don’t like and if Fox  a News don’t stop  treating this man like he owns the network they will go down “Stocks”
581 2018-12-05 17:40:02 Just Saving this for a few years from now. You will see all these tweets. When we are $50K plus.  Enjoy! I've seen this movie many times before. Not just in Bitcoin but in Stocks. #Bitcoin will be the only money everywhere.
582 2018-12-05 17:39:52 Ask the National blood service how much blood they discarded after the Westgate attack. Best to keep sensible stocks for emergencies, and definitely have a system like @wehaveblood - donors on demand. An initiative spearheaded by @vancemuriu. Many many lives saved.
583 2018-12-05 17:39:44 @StarlingBank this new round up feature, will you offering an investment opportunities with it as in a stocks and share isa?
584 2018-12-05 17:39:41 Stocks as in like a grunge or something? Lol I get confused
585 2018-12-05 17:39:26 True enough, but pot stocks tend to follow very similar patterns when they rally and when they fall. When Constellation brands bought a slice of Canopy it floated most boats. The big stain on Aphria at this moment is hurting most as well.
586 2018-12-05 17:38:38 How is a president allowed  to own stocks at all?
587 2018-12-05 17:38:28 Mais oui, nous avons des stocks de SHA nous aussi

594 2018-12-05 17:34:56 Q for the show today.  after multi year runups of growth tech stocks.l, what valuation metrics do you use to know when they are cheap again after 30%+ selloffs weve seen since 2940spx500. Noone ever tells us that, they only tell us to buy them after 300% 3 year rallies

602 2018-12-05 17:31:06 The net issuance of preffered stock for KO was 0. This is excellent as it shows they are able to pay equal amounts of cash to buy back shares to the amount recieved from isssuing stocks.

604 2018-12-05 17:30:30 This graphic doesn’t apply to single stocks. It applies to broader markets only. Thinking individual stocks will follow this pattern has lost a lot of people a lot of money.
605 2018-12-05 17:29:43 The fund(momentum) managers keep claiming as if HUL, HDFC, Reliance and TCS are the only investment grade stocks. Don’t know when the halo around any of these would break. Their valuations leave absolutely no room for disappointment.

607 2018-12-05 17:28:51 Yes. Majority of my CDN investment $ are in CSE stocks. Venture is just good for day trading because for now it has better volume, more variety and better stock screen tools. 

For instance $XMG with all its PP, it cannot hide who's buying in those Form 9's, myself included lol
608 2018-12-05 17:28:47 I can agree on this statement..my tweet was more about the 15 cents up overnight on an already not so bullish ec ens ..now I think market is taking notice at least on the medium/term trend..the low stocks issues is here to stay though

610 2018-12-05 17:28:33 I don't think it's tax loss. It's just all the U stocks don't have momentum. Investors need that confidence, that big and clear sign (like spot hiking every day...).. you can explain them al S/D fundamentals, but final decision is always emotional guided by herd sentiments.
611 2018-12-05 17:26:41 @ProfLowell #fin2209 Nike's stocks have risen to new highs, however Adidas isn't worried, due to the fact that Adidas has still outgrown Nike on a global and USA basis.
612 2018-12-05 17:26:25 Ouais et si ils étaient pas là l’Arc de Triomphe ressemblerait à du Street Art, plus aucun magasin des champs n’aurait de stocks avant noël et des passants/journalistes seraient morts sous les coups de gilets jaunes/casseurs qui pensent exactement la même chose que toi
613 2018-12-05 17:25:44 Im gonna jump in the "hot water" n claim, that BTC is gonna be HUGE, ignited by BAKKT, and if nothing else used as a "safe-heaven" away from fiat n stocks after that 
614 2018-12-05 17:24:28 So glad I got out of the stock market about a month ago, too choppy to trade for me.  It's gold and Bitcoin for now.  I'll take this next year and learn how to short better, most stocks are way overvalued. $spy
615 2018-12-05 17:23:59 Stick him back in the stocks!
616 2018-12-05 17:23:44 To people selling defense stocks because the SECDEF may step down over budget disagreements. This has more to do with NEOCON war hawk @AmbJohnBolton 's increasing influence over Trump, not waning support over military funding. They're gonna "Colin Powell" Mattis.
617 2018-12-05 17:23:07 quite a gap among thebios today

Hybrigenics $ALHYG +122%, abt to go into administration but received a non-sollicited offer from a fund willing to bring assets, pot. from Esperite (one of the worst junk stocks existing imo). Investors bought that... 
618 2018-12-05 17:23:00 It’s good that the bump stocks used in the Las Vegas massacre are being banned but this alone isn’t enough to tackle gun violence.

Gun safety reform must include expanding background checks, regulating magazine clips, closing the gun show loophole and banning assault weapons.
619 2018-12-05 17:22:31 Take a look at global gdp v global debt. Frightening. Many emerging markets not in recession or worse. Stocks are so overpriced. Stock buybacks are hurting dividends & that hurts retirees. -2
620 2018-12-05 17:22:17 You would not believe the day I’ve had. Took them both to a church craft thing after school (), we’re potty training Flora so of course Bonnie pissed herself
621 2018-12-05 17:21:52 If you think you wrote the first short thesis on pot stocks, you're even more deluded than I imagined.  And if you can't see the blatant fraud and self dealing with this company, there's not much left to talk about.
Good luck to you.
622 2018-12-05 17:20:53 They won't even need hit pieces. The funds loaded up on these things are going to take a big hit and when the investor redemptions come they'll be forced to sell other weed stocks for the cash, even the clean ones.
623 2018-12-05 17:20:50 Grey goose stocks are shooting yo as we speak
624 2018-12-05 17:20:31 Investors beware Trump’s tweets about the trade war with China: Like everything else coming out of that man, it likely was all lies. Trump caused a rally and then a dizzying collapse of stocks with his false claims. He ruins everything he touches, lies with every word.
625 2018-12-05 17:20:24 There are a lot of charts outside of cannabis stocks that look like that right now. Cannabis was bound to see a pull back no matter what. True value will begin to be flushed out as products and distribution come on line. Then we'll see who stands or falls.
626 2018-12-05 17:20:13 Interest rate sensitive stocks (Telcos and Utilities) showing continued strength with the increasingly dovish approach from the Bank of Canada.
627 2018-12-05 17:19:23 watch the hit pieces come on all the other "pot" stocks now. with the success of this one. the purchases $APHA did look nearly identical to many others, with inflated valuations for these co's, many acquisitions in this space were done at crazy levels using "cheap" shares.
628 2018-12-05 17:18:25 Anyone with 401K needs to pay attention (or stocks,bonds). When ppl showed up for work at Lehman's,it was gone. I remember Jim Cramer-buty Bear Sterns,a week later gone. It's comes sudden to we the peasants.
629 2018-12-05 17:16:40 PHL stocks rallied above 7,700 yesterday ahead of the release of inflation data. The benchmark PSEi was up 2.27% or 171.02 points to 7,703.92 as investors bet that inflation, whose upward trend in recent months was a major cause of market volatility, would continue to slow.
630 2018-12-05 17:15:56 Retired,elderly so 401K in low-risk stocks with dividend yield about 1% but stock price very,very high. So I cashed in,took the profit. Hoping bull market continues past Jan 1 to cash in rest. Take the $ & run. I have no way to recover. -1
631 2018-12-05 17:15:56 Ayeeee how those pot stocks looking?
632 2018-12-05 17:15:49 What's the difference, stores are empty anyway. Most everyone has gone back to their local dealer. Hence the #real reason #cannabis stocks are in the shitter.
633 2018-12-05 17:15:42 Thank you very much.I sent emails also today and no response.. I  like the platform and the focus  being only on stocks/market but will give up on them if this continues..and not thinking to have a new account as there was absolutely no reason to lock this one. interesting timing
634 2018-12-05 17:15:04 On n'a pas d'informations concernant les stocks, on ne peut rien dire...

637 2018-12-05 17:12:02 $WEED stocks have all gone to "POT" the easy money has been made
638 2018-12-05 17:11:21 Mimi rushed over t my workplace after his work w dinner and honey lemon drink for my throat, and helped me w stocks and housekeeping, and then send me home. I am so blessed. I love this man.
639 2018-12-05 17:10:25 Yup. Plus IRAs, stocks, money market accounts all at different banks.

Like having "only" $30k in checking makes me poor 
640 2018-12-05 17:10:19 Yes

But, in a highly trending stock market in 2017, I also traded some growth stocks like NVDA, FB, ABBV and HD, etc. In a confirmed up trend market, I only BTFD when approaching lower channel/trend-line with %B OS as my main long signals with trailing stops

Avoid TSLA hi Vol
641 2018-12-05 17:09:50 I’m not one for public humiliation but I’d happily bring back the stocks for people who take the lower offer on the chase.
642 2018-12-05 17:09:48 And up to the same old shite. He buys shite stocks, next day he ramps the shite out of them , his followers buy in , he makes a ton of cash and moves on , he uses DM's to spread the words like , a city friend of mine , Word in the city , I have it on good authority etc etc
643 2018-12-05 17:09:17 Agreed, but this year alone is breaking records in the amount of buybacks single companies are doing so, I’d mark it down as significant. There’s nothing wrong with buying back stocks, but the market is practically living off those right now.
644 2018-12-05 17:09:04 Not true because there is still essential difference [empirically] between being hired and dividends/housing rents/net profit by ownership, even the best paid CEO's are hired despite that they also most often own stocks or capital otherwise.
645 2018-12-05 17:07:42 I don’t think Bonnie was as bad, but we are programmed not to remember

Flora is the difficult second album
646 2018-12-05 17:07:35 45 is probably manipulating the market.  Probably secretly snapping up stocks every time his dumb-ass drives the market down.
647 2018-12-05 17:06:33 I hear pigeon stocks are really good right now. It is the perfect time to adopt a pigeon!!
648 2018-12-05 17:06:21 Anyone else think it's odd they declared today the day of mourning for Bush 41 even though he passed days ago and shut down markets after stocks plummeted yesterday?
#Bush #stocks #DayofMourning #suspicious
649 2018-12-05 17:05:30 Unfortunately his base doesn't actually own stocks or have retirement plans. The stock market is just this mythical thing they hear about from Fox News when it's actually doing good.
650 2018-12-05 17:04:50 I'm relatively new to penny stocks but the potential seems to be DOLLARS with $NHPI . So catalyst fixing to hit the fan .
651 2018-12-05 17:03:32 Pot Stocks across the board are tumbling after short sellers comments on Aphria $APHA
652 2018-12-05 17:02:50 There is plenty of opportunity in the stocks not named Aphria as well. None the less, they are all going down. When you couple that with the fact, most the large LPS are trading at prices that can not be justified until 2020 sales if it works out......
653 2018-12-05 17:02:45 He must go. This is incompetence of the highest order and only services to infuriate the people further.

In other news: UK stocks of Yellow Jackets are dangerously low.
654 2018-12-05 17:02:39 But then I anticipate some made money in the Monday run up in stocks which they sold by Tuesday when they knew the truth was going to come out and stocks would plummet.  Also sick!  Stock market like a casino game not an investment.  That needs to change!
655 2018-12-05 17:00:59 Si l'un d'entre vous travaille dans un Mediamarkt, ou un de vos proches, est-ce que je peux vous poser une question : vous avez déjà reçu le jeu dans vos stocks ajd ou vous les recevez demain ?

J'suis à ça de tenter au culot d'aller le demander dans le mien au cas ou...
656 2018-12-05 17:00:48 Data suggest most the money was put into stocks not wges and job expansion.  That is not a good strategy when the market is near full employment.  Failure of supply side Econ.
657 2018-12-05 17:00:47 Is it time to cash out our stocks yet?  

I have been saying yes for months now but my fiancee won't listen to me. It's his money so...all I can do while it goes to is to say...I told you so.

662 2018-12-05 16:59:50 What are the stock symbols for the Canadian stocks you are looking at?
663 2018-12-05 16:58:36 Maybe. I mean sure, gauging off the 85% average of the 3 previous moves down. But...let's not forget...stocks are in severe downtrend. Highly volatile things like crypto can get affected even deeper in times like this. Never good to bank on that 85%
664 2018-12-05 16:58:00 If it involves handcuffs again, might be time to bring back the practice of stocks and people need to show up with rotten produce?

671 2018-12-05 16:51:36 The article makes it clear that gold is not an investment.   Stocks ARE an investment and investing in an S & P index fund, and reinvesting dividends, beats gold very nicely over the long haul.  #CaseClosed   :)
672 2018-12-05 16:51:04 My gut has said I should have sold back in January and invested elsewhere. I know the questionable happenings in cannabis stocks and their managers will come back to haunt investors. The culprits will remain multi-millionaire/billionaires.
673 2018-12-05 16:49:37 also the discount rate used to value stocks measures uncertainty and the present value of all future cash flows is very sensitive to increase in uncertainty
674 2018-12-05 16:49:03 How about public shaming? Bring the stocks back and televise it being used.
675 2018-12-05 16:48:44 Offers & discounts from sellers are until stocks last and due to the overwhelming response to the sale today, sellers have ran out of stock of the items on offer. (1/2)

679 2018-12-05 16:45:40 Well, many mngrs who are doing well simply exposed to same FACTORS but those fund buyers think the manager is actually great at picking stocks & invariably they just get caught in the same Beta situation as a [Small-Mid Value.

680 2018-12-05 16:45:39 See no fundamental reason why stocks shouldn’t be owned right now.

682 2018-12-05 16:45:05 people in my timeline had been saying that it's because SM didn't produce enough of his cd in the first day so it's stuck in 8k. Probably SM didn't expecting this kind of hype for Onew so they didn't have that many stocks... 
683 2018-12-05 16:44:59 Want to beat a bear market with stocks? #stocks You can lose 35% of your money or more, and still beat the market.  Or, perhaps you would prefer  to survive?
684 2018-12-05 16:44:50 It’s not about that honestly. The reason is purely corporate/financial. The government is closed today, and so are the stock exchanges. Premiering the trailer means a significant bump in stock prices so if stocks are closed, Disney would lose out on almost guaranteed stock bumps.
685 2018-12-05 16:43:38 apple stocks rise by 35%.
686 2018-12-05 16:43:33 i think over short term a person buys stocks more based on guessing what someone would pay for it the next day knowing that person making similar guess & so on ad infinitum
687 2018-12-05 16:43:29 Sure looks like this years' seasonal rally in #uranium stocks will be a total dud. Basically non-existent ecept for a select couple. very dissapointing

689 2018-12-05 16:43:04 Defensive stocks in a  BEAR MARKET #stocks get slaughtered, along with everything else.  See the charts during the 2000-2002 and the 2008 markets and see for yourself.  High quality defensives FELL 40-80%; utilities, staples, and medical stocks all cratered.  Wall Street Lies.

694 2018-12-05 16:39:43 While US markets are closed, Canadian markets are still open. Almost all #cannabis stocks are getting crushed. $APHA press release, again, avoided all points made by @QCMFunds and @HindenburgRes. Faith has been completely lost in the entire sector. $cgc $nbev $cron $tlry
695 2018-12-05 16:38:42 I remember i would be down -$79 and be sick to my stomach and refuse to take the loss until it becomes -$350... and look back at the -$79 and wish i could exit there if i had a second chance....exit while you can! Seriously rather out too early than in too long!

720 2018-12-05 16:25:20 What interests me is that whiskies that a few years ago were always thought of as 2nd or 3rd tier producers are now seeking premium pricing. Sometimes just due to rarity. That itself speaks volumes as stocks weren't laid down because demand was previously low for their juice.

739 2018-12-05 16:15:14 Investing is as easy as it is exceedingly complex. People often verbalize cliches like "invest in stocks or real estate" w/o realizing what they're saying. The upside is that "ignorance is bliss" - the idea that TMI leads to second guessing oneself out of a profitable position.

744 2018-12-05 16:12:11 Picking the wrong stocks or index funds might cause you to underperform the market by a few percentage points but buying at all times high then selling during a market crash can lead to much greater underperformance.
745 2018-12-05 16:11:28 1. the 10/2 year is nothing to worry about just yet, and 2.. why the hell are you tagging $AMLH in this? a recession has no effect on OTC stocks, especially when your little pretty boy Bishop scammed you and everyone else. He deleted GG twitter, he lied, he's a coward. Move on.
746 2018-12-05 16:11:17 I agree.   Article made some good points but proper diversification is key.  Long date bonds offer near 100% security and if never sold no reason to worry.  Retirees should def have at least 30% in stocks for sure   Annuities get a bad rap, but they offer some decent security
747 2018-12-05 16:10:22 The SA community loves lottery stocks that "could" go up by 50x (and just like the lottery, you never win).

Twitter is more about "look at how much this company went up! we can go up that much too!" 

This one just happened not to overlap 
748 2018-12-05 16:10:21 I am not an optimist, unless big car companies are forced to own stocks in re-insurance businesses, then enlightenment.
749 2018-12-05 16:09:54 I'm done. No more twitter. I'm going to quit twitter like no one ever quited the twitters before. Twitter stocks will drop and there will be total chaos. I'll burn my computer, disconnect the internet, forget I was ever online.

So i guess i'll see you tomorrow?

752 2018-12-05 16:08:03 As someone with personal experience, no. You cannot live off of 35 years' worth of middle class savings and social security because $100 used to buy more 30 years ago. 80's kids WERE being smart. We've just lost most of our nest egg 2-3 times since adulthood began b/c of stocks.

761 2018-12-05 16:04:40 Same here. I pulled some out in cash when things were up. I didn't think Trump was going to be a stabilizing influence. But still - even the reliable stocks are taking a beating. Fortunately, they haven't reduced dividends, so just waiting it out.

769 2018-12-05 15:56:06 7. Basically, you want to determine under what condition %B would work the best.

8. Up-trend channel stocks, only BTFD on lower channel using %B OS

9. Down-trend channel stocks, shorting all rallies on upper channel using%B OB

10. For side-way channeling stocks, Both OB & OS
770 2018-12-05 15:56:05 Stocks keep going down. Time to buy more 
771 2018-12-05 15:56:03 4) The market approaches a “critical” point–any destabilizing triggering factor can cause a regime change. This is why "no one trigger" could be identified "that sent U.S. stocks into a free-fall" and why "the sell-off had no shortage of explanations among Wall Street traders."
772 2018-12-05 15:55:45 What about Louisville Slugger if someone gets beat up with a bat?

776 2018-12-05 15:52:47 Usually they refresh their stocks at least once super early in the morning. So if you ate an onigiri at 11 pm, the onigiri would have been in the fridge for over 18 hours.
777 2018-12-05 15:52:43 Well at least we have our stocks and investments secure in this amazing economy created by Individual 1....  oh wait.....
778 2018-12-05 15:52:36 5. For Channeling stocks (another topics) with well-defined channel for at least 6 month using weekly chart, then OB & OS also would work grest.

6. Hence drawing channels, trend-line & S/R lines on a chart is very important to determine uptrend or downtrend or channeling for %B

788 2018-12-05 15:49:21 What is worthless is thinking that after all these loses the DOW is still at it's highest level in 30+ years...You place a meme that CHERRY picks losses without pointing out the FACT that the they are still higher than even before.Stocks have high points and then they sell off.

796 2018-12-05 15:45:46 This is the dumbest statement ever. Invested in what? Stocks, bonds, gold, real estate? A tech startup? How about the money you could have saved through a tax cut? Maybe you’re now employed? Talk about click bait

798 2018-12-05 15:44:38 From CanaccordGenuity: Total # of medtech stocks (>$100M market cap) is down from >110 in 2007 to 77 in 8/2018. The Financial Crisis killed off some cos 10 yrs ago, but nos today R below high-80s nos in 2014/15 & much smaller no of small-cap Medtech stocks today, despite  IPOs
799 2018-12-05 15:44:08 It baffles me how many people really don’t get how stocks work or why a stock price for a business is high or low, why the shares the company has outstanding matters, etc. Or that the real focus should be percentage increases/declines, not the dollar amount it goes up or down.
800 2018-12-05 15:42:48 Can you show me how to trade shares of stocks 
801 2018-12-05 15:42:44 An article on CNBC is saying, "Eighty percent of the daily moves in U.S. stocks are machine-led.

"The phenomenon, also called algorithm or algo trading, refers to market transactions that use advanced mathematical models to make high-speed trading decisions." ...

804 2018-12-05 15:39:27 Shorting stocks has always been the big grift.  Trump was never in this because of a heart of service.... it’s always been because of the money.

815 2018-12-05 15:33:18 During the 2001 dotcom crashed, the media was using the term “overhyped” and “fad” a lot.  

Today that sounds ridiculous to call the internet that but back during the crash those were two popular words used by the media like CNBC to describe the demise of the internet stocks.

820 2018-12-05 15:31:06 Trump seems so desperate to talk up U.S. Stocks today with hopeful China trade talk.
821 2018-12-05 15:30:42 That’s because they only buy trim from other LPs to turn into oil to ship to Germany at a higher price to keep their stocks up!

823 2018-12-05 15:28:37 Lol. Oh wow, you don’t get it? Stocks are based on percentages. So let’s say amazon loses 20% in 3 months (it did), and you have $10k in it, you lost $2k. 

Now, let’s say I have $10k and I make 20% in a week(I have and do frequently), I made $2k in a week. Simple.

827 2018-12-05 15:27:48 People are so under hedged for volatility it is shocking. There was a 45% Implied vs Real volatility discount going into Tuesdays market for Tech stocks....the stocks that have been crashing for 2+ months. Insane!
828 2018-12-05 15:27:32 He called himself “Tariff Man” in a tweet that sent stocks tumbling after overstating his trade agreement success with China. WTF do they mean toned down?

830 2018-12-05 15:26:07 Your boi Trump just regulated bump stocks. NRA is losing money and memberships and Dems took the house. Keep pretending that regulations aren’t going to happen.

when stocks go down, well that’s bad
853 2018-12-05 15:18:26 @NRA is there a reason you guys have been silent on Trump's RINO action of banning bump stocks? He has now effectively done more to remove our rights than Obama did in 8 years. Does the "R" next to his name make it okay?

Not one more dime to you.
854 2018-12-05 15:17:51 And I’ll admit I don’t know much about stocks or the SEC. I’ve never had enough money to make an investment. I believe what you’re saying, and can only hope this manipulation is so egregious, bold and in your face they can’t possibly miss it. Plain as the nose on their face?

860 2018-12-05 15:15:04 Don't think any company has ever gone bust from what short sellers are doing. Could be some short term movements of course but from what I've seen the highly shorted stocks just as likely to go up rather than down!

866 2018-12-05 15:13:05 That is one strange definition of “truce.”  While at the same time Trump calls himself “Mr. Tarrif” and personally cause a significant 1 day drop in the markets as investors see little to no change coming from this so called truce and bail on most stocks.

874 2018-12-05 15:10:00 No, it went up over 13,000 points under Obama and 5,000 under Trump, so do the math. Which is a greater number? I think my stocks went up more under Obama. Trumps gains were entirely due to tax cuts.
875 2018-12-05 15:09:44 Selling something WITHOUT REAL VALUE is a scam.  That includes penny stocks, ponzi shares, pyramid tokens, lottery tickets -- and cryptocurrencies.

896 2018-12-05 14:57:46 the point we were trying to make is that dividend companies aren't better than value or growth. It is about picking good companies, but there are great stocks with no dividends too.

907 2018-12-05 14:51:59 Like I've said before I'll give him credit. Just because I like Obama doesn't mean I worship him. My business is stocks and the economy so if Trump's keeps the train going I'm happy, but more than 4% growth starts to get dangerous with risk of bubbles and inflation. We'll see

914 2018-12-05 14:49:14 Comparing your stocks to a friend's is a very dangerous thing in investing. People often tout their winners and hide their losers, making you feel financially scarce. You'll be tempted to take outsized risks to keep up...as will your friend. It's a lose-lose situation.

# avoid sectors with govt intervention 
# avoid tech, too disruptive

# TRY to avoid stocks, whose biz model has inbuilt leverage (banks, financials) 
# avoid sectors which require HUGE capex
# avoid cyclicals
929 2018-12-05 14:41:46 The SEC isn’t stupid though, so hopefully that’s just one more thing to hold him accountable for. I’m sure he has all the best stocks  But yeah seriously I really think he’s purposely manipulating the market.

931 2018-12-05 14:41:13 US markets ( Bonds & Stocks indices) are closed this afternoon. ( Beware of "thin" volume and increased vol therefore ) Yesterday the VIX index gained almost 16% .In FX markets, the ranges are below average except for GBP pairs and commodity currencies
932 2018-12-05 14:41:10 The revised numbers of annual GDP they produce a final revised growth rate at the end of the year until those end of year figures show nothings official. And it doesnt take a rich person to be an investor I was working minimum wage and ended up making more from stocks than my job
933 2018-12-05 14:40:50 Looks like tax loss selling is having a negative impact on #Uranium stocks. Not sure it is wise to sell #Uranium stocks at this point but some investors don't have the stomach for the volatility. VIX was up again yesterday.

950 2018-12-05 14:33:02 Some are saying this could be similiar to 2015/2016 , it certainly could, but what are the odds of that in light insane hyperextension in stocks?

969 2018-12-05 14:23:33 @johniadarola I still feel like Trump is still telling his wealthy friends to buy/sell stocks before he sends out tweets. It still feels like insider trading. Think about it one tweet & the Stock Market jumps 400 points, then another contradictory tweet & it drops 800.
970 2018-12-05 14:23:03 Stocks tank because Wall Street is populated by lemmings. They will follow anyone over the cliff based on nothing but SWAG's and speculation. Anyone with money in the stock market is a fool, and, a fool and his money are soon parted.
971 2018-12-05 14:23:02 Certainly but the current hyperextension that we see in many stocks could cause sharper crashes and a bear may present themselves differently. I do agree there will be big rallies we should take advantage of them. $spy $spx $amzn $aapl

981 2018-12-05 14:20:17 Keep in mind that as the yield curve flattens with 10Y rates pulling in, long-term equity investors are seeing the value of future discounted cash flows increase. That’s often overlooked when the market (traders and algos) freaks out by dumping stocks.

995 2018-12-05 14:12:14 .@IBDinvestors: 

The broad and deep sell-off, combined with a shortage of fresh breakouts by high-quality growth stocks, triggered a downgrade in the current outlook for the U.S. stock market to "uptrend under pressure." 

Be ready to sell... New buys warrant extra caution.

1020 2018-12-05 13:58:12 IMO this is the "money quote" and the key point about this expansion generally. We've seen tremendous asset inflation for yrs (not just traditional 1s like stocks, risky bonds, or housing/CRE, but also esoteric ones like NFL teams, collectibles, artwork, baseball cards, etc,)
1021 2018-12-05 13:57:02 The Dow has gone from 19,250 to 25,000 in the last two years.  Just open your Stocks app on your iPhone and check.  Anyone who pays attention to a one day dip OR rise should not invest in the stock market.

1033 2018-12-05 13:53:03 Spoken like a true ex-civil servant. Part time jobs and pay suggest exactly the opposite. Lots of part time jobs and above average pay rises. Also, to offset monopsony need to consider flows not stocks & there are about 5-6 million hirings each year. Promote poaching & disloyalty
1034 2018-12-05 13:52:39 Also, how long until we find out a bunch of Russians (or Trump himself) made a ton of money off of this tweet? He must've known it would tank stocks. Who profited?...
1035 2018-12-05 13:52:34 So the market went up one day and down the next.  It happens. A lot of the drop yesterday had to do with bank stocks tanking.  Not trade related

1055 2018-12-05 13:43:14 Investors supposedly hate uncertainty, but the uncertainty of a 90-day delay to extra tariffs on China turned out to be better than the certainty of extra tariffs—for a day. Stocks soared on Monday as markets welcomed the cease-fire over the weekend in the U.S.-China trade spat
1056 2018-12-05 13:43:14 There has to be a return to sanity at some point. So many important issues being turned into eye rolling laughing stocks due to being taken over craziest elements.
1057 2018-12-05 13:42:56 People bought stocks Monday based on your comments about an “incredible deal” then on Tuesday when it was discovered that there was no such deal and you lied people lost money.

1100 2018-12-05 13:26:31 I think the market is muddled about the FED & stocks outlook (a.k.a risk outlook) into Dec 19th FOMC. With the year's trading performance practically over, I don't expect large market punts with bullish or bearish intention until that FOMC. Subsequent trades will be 2019 plays

1113 2018-12-05 13:22:09 Great point and potential solution. People forget our modern Consumer Capitalist society is predicated upon us buying more “stuff”. That stuff may or may not help bridge the gap. Some ppl do prefer stocks over watches, but OUR community hasn’t had the opportunities to learn this.
1114 2018-12-05 13:21:31 It’s a bigger problem today since stocks tend to race up to such extreme valuations
1115 2018-12-05 13:20:59 Recently there has been a big sickness problem in their natural environment in Africa

1123 2018-12-05 13:17:30 No its not. The last 10 years of cheap money kept all the capital in the banks and securities like stocks. The recent rate hikes is why the 5yr bond yield inverse yet mfg numbers remain high. The capital markts are still trying to figure it out. Hopefully they dont panic.

1150 2018-12-05 12:59:21 But why does it matter?  If the quants knock the $AAPL PE from 16 to 15, because of some algo, that’s a buying opp for long-term players. Who’s it hurting? Short term traders/gamblers? The underperforming hedge funds that charge usurious rates?  Stocks go up and down.

1156 2018-12-05 12:57:24 Stock moves are asymmetric: large drops happen far more often than large gains (but also small gains are more common than small drops, indeed so much so that overall stocks usually rise in aggregate over long timeframes).

1172 2018-12-05 12:50:36 Of course he is. Buys up all the stocks us poor dolts sell and, eventually, only the top 5% of the most wealthy hold it all while our investments drop like stones and crumble. #fucktrump
1173 2018-12-05 12:49:49 Everyone makes trading or investment mistakes. 

It's critical to face them head on, and move on, taking the loss the best we can.  
One of many this year for me was bullish energy stocks. I thought they were exceptionally cheap with $70 WTI.  
Then oil crashed. Why? Irrelevant.

1176 2018-12-05 12:49:05 @IchimokuScholar @Crypto_C00kie Guys, small question ... Do you know the percentage of profitable trades when using the Trendmaster Premium system? Does this also work on stocks? Or only crypto?
1177 2018-12-05 12:48:01 Exiting the EU & the CFP after 40 yrs  will certainly pose some unique challenges in relation to UNCLOS. All CS have a long history of fishing in each others waters outside territorial limits. Main challenge is defining shared stocks & agreeing on % based on spatial dependency.

1189 2018-12-05 12:42:59 1 I am simply short Tesla an investment idea. And it is my only short. But it did occur to me that at least it ought to act as a bit of a hedge in a down market having some positive correlation to the S & P 500. There were 31 stocks up yesterday in the S&P. Almost all utilities.
1190 2018-12-05 12:42:24 If we're laughing stocks. Why is Paris burning & America is stronger than ever. Trump stole G20 from the Globalist. And China is backing down on their Tariffs. Plus people, who are not EVEN US citizens DEMANDING to open the borders.

So much laughing.

Remember that the market is the only proof of the “great economy” you claim. Folks who don’t manage stocks haven’t had a wage increase under you; only CEOs & other wealthy donors.

1212 2018-12-05 12:23:28 I continue to be optimistic about some good trading into the end of the year but individual stocks have to improve before i put capital to work.  There are many names being unfairly punished in this algo-driven selling.

1224 2018-12-05 12:16:49 In 2018 under Trump, stocks are up 1.008%. Obama's last year was 13.42% with his highest year being in 2013 with 26.5%. Just saying.
1225 2018-12-05 12:16:47 The confusion around gold is the mistaken belief that it's an investment, when in fact it's hard money. It makes no sense to be compared with stocks/bonds.

Funny how Buffett shows such a misunderstanding of money considering most of his investment gains come from its debasement.

1227 2018-12-05 12:16:25 Shorts get called out to cover when the institutions (hedge funds) estimate that the price is so high and continues to climb that shorts are less likely to be able to buy them further down the line. At that point shorts need to cover, that is buy the stocks at current value.
1228 2018-12-05 12:15:09 Morning Scan Bank stocks plunge but CEOs bullish; BofA makes exec changes
1229 2018-12-05 12:13:30 Actually, stocks in 2018 have only grown 1.008% under Trump as of yesterday's 799 point crash. Looking back under Obama his average stock market annual increase over his 8 years was 11%. His last year in 2016 was 13.42% increase. His highest year was 2013 at 26.5%. Pesky FACTS.
1230 2018-12-05 12:13:04 Does it stack? Like is it even easier if you're down 2, or 3 stocks?
1231 2018-12-05 12:12:19 Continuous sliding of stocks will jeopardize client's exposures and will further erode values. However, no possibility of systematic risk is envisaged as Regulators have developed systems to avert crisis.

1280 2018-12-05 11:36:27 Battered May food IPO counter Libstar #LBR trades at 581 cents a fall of -53% from its listing price as its slips below 600 cents

This counter is a December YE means unlike most other food stocks it can't fully capitalise on the Festive season for its results. I fear for HEPS

1288 2018-12-05 11:30:25 Some very useful history, thank you.  "Taking back" control of our waters (control we have never had!) is only part of the jigsaw.  It still leaves the management of shared stocks and mutual access to be negotiated. The NFFO and SFF hope to use access as a negotiating card.

1291 2018-12-05 11:26:57 Depends on how much money he has made. Does he make erratic announcements about trade because he is buying and selling stocks as they dive up and down? Does he sell short and make the market lose value?

1297 2018-12-05 11:19:40 Amazing that people think that Bitcoin is going away when it trades 24/7. American stocks trade mostly during two hours a day, five days a week. Maybe stocks are going away?! Stocks lost more value just yesterday that all Bitcoins are worth combined.

1312 2018-12-05 11:02:47 Starbreeze offices (Payday 2 devs, new Walking Dead devs, published Dead by Daylight) were RAIDED this morning in connection with suspicions of insider trading

It appears they kept certain information secret as the CEO and CFO sold their stocks before publishing the info (1/2)
1313 2018-12-05 11:01:32 It's all good and well that we'd like the rest of the world to buy Italian bonds or Spanish stocks - they won't (or at least not in such big numbers), as long as there isn't a large, liquid safe asset denominated in euro (aka eurobonds) that they can flee to in times of turmoil.

1318 2018-12-05 10:58:07 Dow lost 800 points when one person spoke- not Xi or @POTUS !   Stocks began falling to their lows of the day after Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of Doubleline Capital, told Reuters this inversion signals that the economy "is poised to weaken."      How ridiculous!

1320 2018-12-05 10:55:41 Unless they are stockholders who have held dividend stocks for a while, most people are very wary of promises regarding "dividend checks."

Those who have experience with dividends are usually in the top 5% of a population. 

The other 95% has no dividend experience. Suspicious.

1324 2018-12-05 10:53:05 On the other hand, these day most of traders are scalping or daytrading Bitcoin and stocks with leverage, so the newcomers are getting used to daytrade on everything because they don't know other way. 
I don't believe this can be stopped until they lose all their money.

1326 2018-12-05 10:51:55 That is how Trump makes America great. He tells his friends to sell short and then tweets. Stocks go down and his friends get richer.

1352 2018-12-05 10:28:14 you have to know that trading stocks and options is all about gradual growth of wealth and not trying to get rich overnight.

1358 2018-12-05 10:23:59 My wife sold much of our stocks and mutual funds about 18 months ago and knew the market would bounce up (not making her $ because she was out), and then market would tank. Up, down, and a final long-term tank. Either we hit Tank or still going Down. Get $$$ out of stock market.
1359 2018-12-05 10:23:12 What crazy low volumes in the small and midcap stocks. Reminds me of the later part of 2013. Hopefully 2019 would be how 2014 went. Keep buying things where you have high conviction. It’s not the market but the individual stocks which will make you richer.Happy investing.

1364 2018-12-05 10:20:54 I believe that Trump is making meetings with the other countries to make his stocks he has to go up.

ask yourself wat might happen at higher probability ,
+ is it that more people are investing in stocks OR
+ is it that less people are investing in stocks?
1403 2018-12-05 09:47:13 This is a v good tip, I shall investigate. My niche gripe with the brands The Iconic stocks is that they all seem to be into designing short tight dresses. Like I don’t want a sack but also sometimes I do?
1404 2018-12-05 09:46:06 Index best for cost / liquidity.
#UK home-builders / property best for discount (inherently more risk).

#brexit vote did not give investor exit chance last time, nor will it this time.
stocks will gap one way or other on material news.

your view on outcomes and probabilities ?
1405 2018-12-05 09:45:59 lols.......one does not own stocks.......one owns businesses....and businesses dont change with election outcomes!.......
1406 2018-12-05 09:45:37 The USD has held onto gains made yesterday and overnight but markets are very nervous. Stocks got a boost as China finlly said some positive things about the Trump meeting but the rally is muted so far.
1407 2018-12-05 09:45:20 As an Australian respectfully I look and see that you guys don’t get it! Those stocks are going down because they were inflated by unfair economic practices of those corporations. Buy your stocks in corporations that will benefit by the rightful protection of your own production!

1582 2018-12-05 07:16:48 Asian stocks sank after Wall Street plunged amid confusion. U.S.-China agreement faltered after conflicting comments from US President & some senior officials.

1593 2018-12-05 07:09:21 It's a pump-and-dump scheme, which usually involves over-the-counter "penny" stocks. A market influencer as powerful as Trump can enable this sort of fraud on a much grander scale, with some of the most heavily capitalized corporations in the world. It's that much riskier, too.
1594 2018-12-05 07:08:29 Also @realDonaldTrump’s own financial guy, Larry Kudlow was on a clip on TV. I heard him talking “RECESSION” today along with several other professionals in finance. It all links back to that tax cut. Just look at the Nasdaq, Market, Stocks! Larry will deny it to tRump! No balls!

Similarly his sons might be running some dubious company buying and selling stocks.

1718 2018-12-05 05:44:44 I am fully aware of what neo means. You are a neoconservative and neoliberal (favoring free market capitalism).

1719 2018-12-05 05:44:26 Since Theta decays exponentially once there is less than 30 days till expiration I look for options that are 5-6 weeks out.  This allows me to give a trade 1-2 weeks to work without having to worry much about Theta.  It works great for momentum stocks nearing a breakout.

1752 2018-12-05 05:27:20 Using IBKR as competition, I got E*TRADE to bring my commissions down to $3.95 for stocks, $0.40 per option contract and 5% flat margin rate. Why didn’t I think about this before?

1754 2018-12-05 05:23:12 Zach, you didn’t know the dow just plunged almost 800 points today. And over the whole year, the stocks went up and down, up and down all over again. Are you tired of winning yet?

* Oil falls as trade woes stoke demand concerns
1765 2018-12-05 05:11:45 It seems more like Trump is doing insider trading.

One week he'll act tough, stocks will crash. Next week he'll act easy, market will go up. Cycle is repeating every week for a month now.

I will not be surprised if he is doing this just to make money out of stock markets.
1766 2018-12-05 05:11:40 Yup. Corporate buyback of stocks with the billions in tax breaks to artificially inflate value to stockholders. The next crash, waiting to happen.
1767 2018-12-05 05:11:28 Tariffs are a tax paid by American companies and ultimately, American consumers.  Oh and Thanks for today’s +3% drop in stocks
1768 2018-12-05 05:11:18 Good fight back Josh.  Have to admit I was heavily short bias on the tech stocks as well but when I saw them gaping way down on open I left them alone and went for some others.

1774 2018-12-05 05:07:54 We all know about how huge wealth creators like Berkshire, Amazon and Apple had more than 50% drawdowns multiple times. We somehow think our stocks would be immune to such falls. No stock has any divine protection to avoid these drawdowns.

1795 2018-12-05 04:57:26 the stock market is up over 30% since Nov 2016. I am not a Trump supporter, but I'm not sure judging him by the stock market is really the point. (It doesnt reflect reality for a lot of people who dont own significant levels of stocks.
1796 2018-12-05 04:57:00 There will be bull markets in which you will lose money buying stocks and there will be bear markets in which you will lose money selling stocks. Then why discuss the markets and not stocks

As it stands now, either some people would need pay cuts, or they'd have to start lobbying Congress to raise the minimum wage.

1813 2018-12-05 04:44:40 No. Stocks are down lower than in years. American industry, American stockholders, don't believe you. Tariffs are being paid by the consumer, the same ones who pay for everything else. You have no clue what you're doing.

1836 2018-12-05 04:29:23 Hi news friends!
On days like this, let’s avoid things like: “Don’t check your 401(k) today!”
By all means, check your 401(k). Just maybe think about not selling stocks you hold today, unless the value is enough to retire and you’re ready to pull the trigger.

1840 2018-12-05 04:25:29 No that is not what I said.  I said everybody involved in the gig.  And hopefully, if someone has a 401k there are more than stocks in it. Like treasury securities, bonds, money markets, and other financial representations.  Now then what do you want to school me in?
1841 2018-12-05 04:24:46 I dislike society and its attitudes as a whole, but callout culture is the worst. It’s akin to putting a person in stocks as a public spectacle and throwing tomatoes. What century are we in, again? Investigate a person before echoing someone who tells you they’re bad. Grow up.
1842 2018-12-05 04:24:33 To sell and get rid of overpriced junk stocks they need a buyers, they control the media thus they come up with these shows hoping to entice suckers, but anyone with a pulse can tell stocks are way overpriced and these falls are very likely just the begining.
1843 2018-12-05 04:23:05 So it is shorties fault that you keep picking wrong stocks at wrong times?

1855 2018-12-05 04:15:46 Inversions didn’t predict past recessions. If you look carefully, it’s when the inversion ends, then recession begins. Fed cuts as econ is slowing, curve starts steeping out of inversion, and then you have your recession. Stocks will have crashed before recession is obvious.

1882 2018-12-05 03:59:44 Amazing how social media has such a presence in our day-to-day lives that one tweet can lower our whole country's stocks by 4% in one day
1883 2018-12-05 03:59:18 for me, I'm young enough to be in it for a long term.  Not to worry you but see what happens to the European markets (FTSE, CAC, DAX) to see if the loss it worst than today's Dow dump. US stocks closed tomorrow for Bush so, knock on wood, the market getting a day of calm or Fri

1886 2018-12-05 03:54:44 Trump and his dad used to make bogus announcements to swing and influence stocks and they would buy and sell. This is what Trump is still doing today as president.  #NYTimes

1899 2018-12-05 03:47:30 Stocks are for people who can afford to lose half their money . That equates to .001 % of the population. Its ridiculous how Americans put such a large portion of their retirement money automatically in such a volatile asset. Not to mention an overvalued one
1900 2018-12-05 03:47:22 Like stocks have taught me, be careful what you invest in

1- tweet/do something stupid and tank stocks

2- shell companies scoop up the dirt cheap stocks

3- tweet out some "plan" or act like a leader and the price goes back up

Right?

1914 2018-12-05 03:42:24 The stock market has been doing this yo-yo thing on the basis of trump pulling the strings via his tweets. Today was the best example. Is he profiteering from this? Is he manipulating news on purpose to make money on stocks? Or his children??? Just wondering...

1934 2018-12-05 03:32:36 Now maybe his support will wake up,had a chance to do a great deal/through talks,rather than keep tarriffs could have put deadline to lift if he laid out plans,never so back to destroying farmers etc,proping up economy now stocks hitting a dive !

1937 2018-12-05 03:31:17 My point was to look at all industries and GDP in the country and base our wealth on that, not simply how the stock market is doing. Stocks will always go up and down, so it's not the biggest issue if the market goes down.....and I wouldn't say it crashed. Not by a long shot
1938 2018-12-05 03:31:11 U guys usually just give daily stock weather reports. How about investing in stocks period? Timers usually lose there $$ other than skilled people like U. Stocks are lifelong holdings.
1939 2018-12-05 03:28:14 For too long other countries have seen us as weak and have taken advantage of our loose purse strings. The market will rebound and if people are smart they will take this opportunity to invest while stocks drop a bit. This problem was years in the making..

1947 2018-12-05 03:24:19 That is so good....I believe before he was a modified guy he races mini stocks/mods and i watched him at Five Mile Point Speedway (one of my home tracks)
1948 2018-12-05 03:23:47 That's a different type of risk/investment vs stocks or real estate. Personally, I think being a business owner is the biggest risk anybody can take and should absolutely be benefited by lower taxes and regulation. Most of my clients are business owners and I applaud anybody...
1949 2018-12-05 03:23:36 Well even with ill intent or not, either they find some practice that will keep them going or they will be shut down like Blockbuster
It's been found out today that they lost around 200 million dollars and their stocks went down 12%. They are dying and something will happen

1962 2018-12-05 03:19:48 Hugely flawed argument. Doesn’t take into account dividends stocks pay or low risk investments in bonds. Every investor has individual risk tolerance and volatility they can handle.Yelling this fact over and over doesn’t change that.
1963 2018-12-05 03:19:21 Agree. And it's not like stocks, precious metals or fiat currencies are scam free :). Lots of Ponzi schemes, fools gold and counterfeit currencies in our history as a species :)
1964 2018-12-05 03:19:13 the desired effect of the memo was definitely not intended to cause fear which would cause people to sell which would cause stock prices to go lower so that JPM and the other wall street scumbags can buy stocks at a discout
1965 2018-12-05 03:18:20 To be fair stocks would drop if they did release it then as it is still a national day of mourning

1983 2018-12-05 03:11:26 The point I'm trying to make is that the money was not paid back due to a recovered industry, it was made back by the sell off of stocks that our government inherited.  GM only paid back a small percentage even though most of the funds were recovered.
1984 2018-12-05 03:11:02 Anyway we can get a law passed that he can't post on twitter anymore?  My stocks take a hit every time he does.

I never knew I owned Amhieser Bush until it popped up as an account holder of my assets.
They sold my stocks and put into unclaimed money
Still wait for my $.
Do not be like me and look for yours.
1999 2018-12-05 03:00:48 Retard, I can deal with smart... I can not talk to stupid. Do you own stocks? Market dropped 800 points, today. Largest home builder in the country signals alarm for declining real estate sales. Do you own real estate? Obama lent GM billions. They paid it back. Do you own a car?

2005 2018-12-05 02:56:42 I would have started TMs in 2016 not 2017. What I would have done if I was Bang. Secure ur cash cow so they couldn’t leave then negotiate. My lawyers said absolutely no to stocks 4 boys. Don’t ever give power away. Me, being soft hearted, I would have given them some. Did Bang?
2006 2018-12-05 02:55:42 I think along your lines of thinking, we could impose a maximum income by taxing at 90% over 250K/yr. Then tax corporations according to their disparity in income. CEO makes 500% more, taxed at 50%. That counts ALL compensation. Stocks, futures, bonuses, etc. Good for shareholder

2008 2018-12-05 02:54:35 @AdamWylde You're 100% right about the kid who owns the Seattle team rights. Jesse saying "he bought it so he could get paid later" is exactly what he did, which is a smart investment. That's how stocks work, no? Buy low, sell high?

2013 2018-12-05 02:51:03 I totally support it. When stocks fall, the government should buy them - and then put them in a trust that distributes dividends from those stocks to the people (either as a UBI or subsidizing healthcare)
2014 2018-12-05 02:50:42 No it isn't about d president been a laughing stocks its about those duns who thinks with their bum bum instead of brains to believed a truant that Nig president is cloned even clergies. They reduced themselves to rubbles of time while d man goes stronger. Shame on them all

2017 2018-12-05 02:47:22 Most *Americans* don't. Less than half have any spot in the market (through, say, a 401k). 84% of ALL stocks are owned by the top 10%. It's adult high-risk gambling that many can't play with when trying to stretch the $25 to your name to last the last week of each month.

2022 2018-12-05 02:44:27 Agreed. Market was going good today and he sent that weird tweet about tariffs. I bet he doesn’t even own any stocks
2023 2018-12-05 02:43:29 Bazookas are regulated by the ATF as an explosive. Your original argument was "assault weapons and bump stocks" why change now? Oh because youre wrong.

And yes I should be allowed to own a bazooka.
2024 2018-12-05 02:43:23 Trump created a pickle. Economic slowdown coupled with rising fed interest rates creates decreasing stock value. If they stop raising interest rates, we'll go straight into a recession. Either stocks lose value or we go into recession. Caused by tax cuts and tariffs.
2025 2018-12-05 02:43:05 The interesting thing about algo trading is the parameters are programmed based on analysis of patterns but the data points have no meaning other than data.

2033 2018-12-05 02:36:20 Exactly. And for the quant you just need a couple data points. There is 2% edge on the chance that when pork bellies go down a point when sorghum trades at a particular volume and shipping stocks are off a half you will see soybean futures go up two ticks for 20 minutes.

    U.S. stocks plunged, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling almost 800 points, as a litany of concerns wiped out the rally in risk assets.

    The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell six basis points to 2.91 percent Tuesday.
2053 2018-12-05 02:20:50 Stocks in Australia, Japan and South Korea slid less than the 3.2 percent tumble in the S&P 500 Index.
2054 2018-12-05 02:20:41 Asian equities dropped in the wake of the the biggest slide in stocks on Wall Street since the mid-October downdraft, though U.S. futures advanced after China officially echoed President Donald Trump’s optimism over bilateral trade talks.

2121 2018-12-05 01:43:36 stocks rise by 1%.
2122 2018-12-05 01:42:02 Big thanks BB! Trying to grind out solid work, we got to hit the curve balls too
2123 2018-12-05 01:41:34 Suggest comsec forum needs a new fresh format. It's not intuitive to use. Hard to find threads on particular stocks, I even found it hard to locate my own posts, so I gave up. Easier to follow the talk on hc although I'm banned from contributing
2124 2018-12-05 01:41:19 My opinion only: Never short stocks - learn about put options.  3x leverage ETFs are only to be held for less than one trading day.  Leveraged ETFs do not perform over time how you would expect (seeking alpha articles etc etc).
2125 2018-12-05 01:40:07 Their stock price is up 20%.  Hard to believe that their sales could be tanking if their stocks are doing so well
2126 2018-12-05 01:38:33 I don’t have stocks. I work a real job.
2127 2018-12-05 01:38:17 @maddow does anyone think Trump is screwing with stock market over trade deals and tarriffs on purpose to short stocks
2128 2018-12-05 01:37:34 I can't even look at my stock portfolio or I will cry since mostly tech stocks.  He is running the country like his businesses.
2129 2018-12-05 01:37:15 Oh yeah! Stocks in Depends just skyrocketed!!
2130 2018-12-05 01:36:43 @realDonaldTrump lied to the world after the G-20 meeting about US China trade situation and his lies caused investors to worry about US financially. Stocks take big loss. Your fault Trump. Bad guy!!!
2131 2018-12-05 01:36:03 yep. And now they don't even hide it. $TIS is hiring some bankruptcy advisor. #Bankruptcy #OrchidsPaper #stocks
2132 2018-12-05 01:35:57 In the short term, the world stock markets are nothing but a Trumptweet sentiment index.

#stocks
2133 2018-12-05 01:35:31 this drop in stocks today 
  reminds me of 2018....

 $VIX
2134 2018-12-05 01:35:30 Stocks in a panic today. Recession on the horizon. Trump panicked and tried to do a deal with China at the G9. They told him to fuck off. You've pinned your colours to the wrong donkey
2135 2018-12-05 01:35:19 #stocks For the bulls, the market is is in the English Channel, and they are on the lookout 24/7 for land, which is just over the horizon.  "Land ahoy" they long to shout.  For the bears, the market is being dragged further and further into the Pacific, headed for the whirlpool.
2136 2018-12-05 01:34:00 Most Trump supporters don't even own stocks. In their mind they do while thinking Donnie cares about them. #DontheCon
2137 2018-12-05 01:32:35 Yah the stocks are responding "bigly" to your trade Tariffs, the DOW just dropped another 800 points points today alone. Once you and your gang of angry Republicans get done wrecking the US economy and driving up the Debt it'll be interesting to see what you do for an encore.
2138 2018-12-05 01:32:18 I still think the market is undervalued because of the Trump tax cuts and new trade deals. But stocks and crypto.
2139 2018-12-05 01:30:45 The individual who stocks shelves, cleans the floors, and cashiers. They all got raises. The multiplication factor of any cost increase is exponential. Farmers' input costs due to carbon tax on fuel, etc also plays a big part. All things considered I would say it could be worse.
2140 2018-12-05 01:30:10 @KNX1070 #oops u guys just played the wrong #BloombergBusiness news.  She said stocks went up 200 points. I’m pretty sure #thatisnottrue #oops no one said anything. Did u guys even notice?
2141 2018-12-05 01:29:30 They're thinking "tomorrow is another day" and stocks will rise again.
2142 2018-12-05 01:29:20 My stocks ain’t worth shit anymore smh fuck trump
2143 2018-12-05 01:29:14 Stocks move quickly and the economy moves slowly. If you follow the tape instead of the data, you'll drive yourself mad.
2144 2018-12-05 01:29:10 US stocks have risen in value because of the Feds printing of money. The growing asset prices in US are an illusion based on nothing objective. Even the GDP growth of US might end up being an illusion.
2145 2018-12-05 01:28:48 Closed shorts. Only long now on but a few stocks. $ASX might be at a turning point here actually. Certainly for a short term trade and possibly for a medium to long term hold.
2146 2018-12-05 01:28:34 1/ “Engagement” is a broken metric in financial technology. 

In most industries DAU engagement is a good thing. FANG stocks soar when engagement increases. Consistent, obsessive engagement is the desired outcome. 

Fintech startups on the other hand...
2147 2018-12-05 01:27:21 Yes, I noted Icahn's activity seems a particularly flagrant example of insider trading. Also in ethanol related stocks.
2148 2018-12-05 01:27:03 Smooth talking their tariff man. You scared everyone to where stocks dropped today. Good going there.
2149 2018-12-05 01:26:34 It wasnt that that dropped it. It was tech stocks as usuall
2150 2018-12-05 01:25:41 Hell lets go back to open borders, Higher Tax,Korea Sending Missiles,Lower Stocks, No Oil Export, UN To Govern us, Pay Higher Taxes for Fuel for Global Warming,Get rid of Capitalism and go straight socialist,last but not least send all jobs over seas!
2151 2018-12-05 01:25:12 Do you really think potus cares about the stock market?  He probably has never owned any stocks and couldn’t tell you what a dividend is.
2152 2018-12-05 01:25:11 Looking at my journal, most of my losses are from bad entries. Part of it is also because I’m trading stocks with low order flow and bad spreads. Will look to trade only AMD and maybe BABA for the rest of the week.
2153 2018-12-05 01:24:23 It was time to take my losses today with my individual marijuana stocks unfortunately. -30% ugh... It's okay. More opportunities are everywhere and the Market still has so much more to offer! #EscapeTheRatRace
2154 2018-12-05 01:22:52 Di jud ko pwede magpadala sa pagka broke pag naa ko sa shop kay madamay ang mga stocks. Hooo gikapoy nakos tanan, kwaa nako Lord. 
2155 2018-12-05 01:20:02 There aren’t 5000 stocks anymore why is it still called the Wilshire 5000?
2156 2018-12-05 01:19:34 Fears of Brexit problems also weighs on U.S. Stocks today.
2157 2018-12-05 01:19:28 I want that DOW to hit 0 I have no stocks idgaf
2158 2018-12-05 01:19:28 Mr. president on behalf of all legal gun owners I would like u to reconsider the proposed ban on Bump stocks. It would be just another infringement on our 2A rights and one step closer to a gun ban the liberal left wants.
2159 2018-12-05 01:18:36 Thank you Bri. I'm glad you continue to inspire me to keep continuing to try to get into stocks.
2160 2018-12-05 01:18:25 One reason stocks are plummeting- more sellers than buyers!
2161 2018-12-05 01:17:52 At least my stocks are doing great! Oooops!
2162 2018-12-05 01:16:52 Oh no, the Dow plunged 800 points today!  Oh wait, I don’t have stocks or money, so who cares?!
2163 2018-12-05 01:16:45 No more stocks?
2164 2018-12-05 01:16:15 Stocks dropped 800 today, #ResignNow
2165 2018-12-05 01:15:57 Sleep well, your stocks will be fine given time,. Mark my words.
2166 2018-12-05 01:15:37 To late....my stocks just dropped 3%
2167 2018-12-05 01:15:29 To I wish trump would text me before he goes on these rants, I could be making a killing on stocks right now lol
2168 2018-12-05 01:15:01 Meanwhile stocks are plunging.
2169 2018-12-05 01:14:13 One has to wonder if associates of trump shorted stocks before trump sent his "Tariff Man" tweets??

I wouldn't put it past them to be playing the market!
2170 2018-12-05 01:13:51 What if Trump is rattling the market so Junior and Eric can short sell, and buy undervalued stocks? Nah, he is just an idiot.
2171 2018-12-05 01:13:35 He s sheap @markminervini wn whole market falling lyk rock he was saying my stocks not falling more then 2% and whn I ask what r u tryin to prove here , he said am living under rocks and blocked me. Stupidity at its best.
2172 2018-12-05 01:12:27 The #stocks trading machines f-ed up again. Stop putting programs in control. @business
2173 2018-12-05 01:11:55 Trump called himself “Tariff Man” and then stocks plummeted 
2174 2018-12-05 01:11:23 Spot on, the day Trump claimed the big fat ugly #bubble in #stocks as his own creation is the day he ensured he wont be reelected, as the topping in the markets was ironically guaranteed by the #FED's insistence in hiking rates.
2175 2018-12-05 01:10:59 Australia, please don't accept too many Chinese new immigrants, they don't like to buy stocks, generally to say, they like buy many apartments to make the prices of houses very expensive to make many local people can't afford the houses. They like to make everything cheaper and
2176 2018-12-05 01:10:44 One day I’m flipping shoes, the next day I’m trading crypto. Hell why not trade some stocks and commodities? Working on an investment club as well as a real estate plan. Oh yeah, I have 9-5 too.
2177 2018-12-05 01:10:23 Ganaog ang ilang stocks, Twitter is tanking
2178 2018-12-05 01:10:03 Stocks have risen in value because of the Fed printing money. The growing asset prices in US are an illusion based on nothing at all.
2179 2018-12-05 01:10:02 The worlds governments are starting to look into it. Publishers care about the real customers, the investors. BO4 made 500M in a weekend and it caused the stocks to drop. Like Jim sterling says “They don’t want some of the money, they want all of the money”
2180 2018-12-05 01:09:53 So you lie and flip flop and cause stocks to soar and plummet....
Hmmm...

Who's making money off this?
2181 2018-12-05 01:09:39 Stocks tanked today.  What does China know that you are not telling us about the agreement?
2182 2018-12-05 01:09:38 I understand Twitter don't run bank accounts. Don't offer on Twitter and try to fool everyone, just pay back, if you really wish to. I've also lost my hard earned money due to closing of stocks.
2183 2018-12-05 01:09:30 It's great if you like to revel in your self-owns. For example, it pairs shamefully well with desktop Linux, socks 'n 'stocks, &c.
2184 2018-12-05 01:09:13 nothing to do with China selling off of stocks is what made it go down.
2185 2018-12-05 01:08:50 Stocks have risen in value because of the Fed printing money. The growing asset prices in US are an illusion based on nothing at all. Even the GDP growth might end up being an illusion.
2186 2018-12-05 01:08:16 I doubt I'll buy stocks. There are better investments.
2187 2018-12-05 01:07:52 Great job on stocks today!
2188 2018-12-05 01:07:29 help me remember what did @MsCharlotteWWE  do to earn this match ?
Oh yes her family owns a small part of  @WWE stocks !
2189 2018-12-05 01:07:25 @thomasg_grizzle and the team work hard to push free content. Hard work shows. Quality beats quality
2190 2018-12-05 01:06:52 How much money is in equities bc the dollar is a shitty store of wealth?  The grow of passive investing / ETFs highlights this. Investors don't care what stocks they own.
2191 2018-12-05 01:06:03 Since you want credit when stocks are you you get blame for one of largest one game stock losses in history. Nice job
2192 2018-12-05 01:06:02 Wonder if anyone Trump knows sold soybean futures, or automobile stocks yesterday.  I'm guessing they could have cleared 10% easy.
2193 2018-12-05 01:05:31 So how much did Trump associates make trading stocks on the phony trade deal claims, and subsequent reveal?
2194 2018-12-05 01:05:13 Faux paus doesn't count....they thought she would win so didn't press the investigation. She's greased so many palms that my shell oil stocks split.
2195 2018-12-05 01:04:44 stocks where selling off has nothing to do with China. Stop the lies
2196 2018-12-05 01:04:02 Stocks fall as declining U.S. yields, trade woes knock sentiment
2197 2018-12-05 01:03:41 them bozos don't know stocks ha?
2198 2018-12-05 01:02:11 it would be great if WSJ would do some real research as there is more to why stocks fell including computer algorithms, year end adjustments, chronic negative media  coverage re administration and aggressive rate increases.
2199 2018-12-05 01:01:59 DOW closed at -799.36.  Nasdaq and S&P took deep dives, too. An economist on TV made the remark that the investors are (by transferring their money from stocks into safer U.S. bond market) ‘stuffing their money in mattresses’.  Buckle up.. The rides about to get real bumpy.
2200 2018-12-05 01:01:57 Stocks are dropping like a rock, thanks to your horrible presidency built on really bad ideas, hate, and lies
2201 2018-12-05 01:01:41 Their own financial gain. Offers of directorships in big business. Stocks & shares. Jobs for kids & relatives. Future EU positions. Contacts for their businesses, Blackmail. Bribery...etc. All principled reasons for betraying your country,
2202 2018-12-05 00:58:57 But wait I have a middle finger with bump stocks, ghost clips, an assault microwave, and another middle finger.
2203 2018-12-05 00:58:56 Isn’t there an off button on your mouth? You already caused the stocks to tumble today!
2204 2018-12-05 00:55:56 Hold you cash for there will always be buying opporunity after the end of year sell offs on small cap stocks.
2205 2018-12-05 00:55:55 It might be a snapshot but sooner or later big capital will shift from stocks into crypto for diversification of portfolios.
2206 2018-12-05 00:55:52 My pot stocks aren't lit anymore 
2207 2018-12-05 00:55:48 Is that what the dude from Despicable Me is doing these days? Playing the stocks?
2208 2018-12-05 00:55:28 Trying to get certain stocks as low as possible so you can buy them, claim you have a deal with China again, and sell them for a nice profit? You are a horrible, lying, excuse for a president.
2209 2018-12-05 00:54:38 Stocks
2210 2018-12-05 00:54:11 The top 10 per cent of American households hold more than 81 per cent of U.S. stocks. Performance of the Dow irrelevant to millions of working Americans.
2211 2018-12-05 00:53:49 I don't see myself having to worry about my stocks any time soon. lol
2212 2018-12-05 00:53:27 Market close will update stocks tomorrow
2213 2018-12-05 00:52:08 The volatility in the lithium stocks can be depth defying, and not for the faint-hearted.  

This GXY stock is one of those gems, that I’ve been holding for over several years now. 

Longer term trader/investor in $GXY.AX
2214 2018-12-05 00:51:58 it had to do with selling off of stocks not just about China
2215 2018-12-05 00:51:20 Exactly why I sold stocks Monday afternoon :)
2216 2018-12-05 00:49:51 Wow those stocks got fucked... Good.
2217 2018-12-05 00:49:20 Thus, the concerns about where his interests lie.
I wouldn't be shocked to learn that he intentionally tanks corporate stocks via tweets so that he and his can make money in the market buying low.
Why ELSE would he punish GM for closing plants after losing $1B via steel tarrifs?
2218 2018-12-05 00:48:36 @Grimecraft could elevated including DAW stocks ?   
2219 2018-12-05 00:48:25 It's not easy to play expiry. Understanding of trend, banking stocks movement and reading of OI data knowledge is required.
2220 2018-12-05 00:48:25 Yes, a number of people complained and sent emails. Not one reply! Not even an automated one. Ugh. 

I loved Tumblr. But I can't wait to see what it looks like after December 17. Can't wait to see how the stocks of their company will respond to the move.
2221 2018-12-05 00:48:00 By buying back stocks and firing employees...so much winning.
2222 2018-12-05 00:47:33 Risk means chance of.  Green had two concussions prior & was still dealing with effects. They paid 20 mill for a injured player who WHEN concussed again WOULD have his career ended. Like buying a house on fire & paying market value.  If Colbert bought stocks they would be Enron.
2223 2018-12-05 00:46:59 He has violated the Emoluments Clause every second of every since the last words of the oath spewed from his fat face

His foreign oil stocks are why we are the ONLY nation not nationally addressing global warming, for example

Piles of Arab money=cover up #JamalKhashoggi murder
2224 2018-12-05 00:46:56 3. So whatever job and economic growth would have been, everything Trump did tended to increase that number.  The longer term implications of the larger structural deficit are a different issue than growth, job creation, and the fair value of stocks
2225 2018-12-05 00:46:22 Oooo all my stocks just vested today 
2226 2018-12-05 00:45:56 @Jon_Stocks_IT hey look you got your wish!!!!
2227 2018-12-05 00:44:52 With the DOW losing 800 points. Today is a pivotal moment for share holders. What little trust was regained with the last rally has now reaffirmed market volatility and the real threat to core capital. #BTFD has past. Futures are now at stake #Trust #StockMarketNews #Stocks
2228 2018-12-05 00:43:57 Trump is watching @Cnn. They do a 2 minute seg on the stocks dropping and he tweets the tariffs thing.
2229 2018-12-05 00:43:37 The best thing investing in stocks or bonds does is put money somewhere it's harder to spend, IMHO.
2230 2018-12-05 00:43:28 $NCZ.. In Production. Zinc price at 1.22 now. Zinc LME stocks falling away fast. What do they have to do to get recognised.. So undervalued right now!
2231 2018-12-05 00:43:12 Rob Kardashian the computer programmer is checking/trading/buying/selling stocks but is rescued by Mo'Nique.
2232 2018-12-05 00:42:40 Anybody who does not know the difference between to and too doesn't own stocks.
2233 2018-12-05 00:42:13 Do you and your buddies sell all your stocks before you tweet? Then buy hem back after you cause a huge drop.
2234 2018-12-05 00:41:54 Yes indeed lots of trading behind the scenes for Wednesday close!  You can see it moving on day trades watch, but you must choose stocks by each separate symbol for the volume.
2235 2018-12-05 00:41:51 dang it I shoulda sold my stocks when they vested on the 15th huh
2236 2018-12-05 00:40:54 Ban all assault potato peelers now! Eliminate the potato peeler show loophole! Ban ghost potato peelers! Stop selling those bump-stocks for potato peelers! No one needs potato peelers that are used in war! The NPPA is a terrorist organization! I believe I got all the mantas...
2237 2018-12-05 00:40:49 Stocks only
2238 2018-12-05 00:40:00 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2239 2018-12-05 00:39:32 It's a little better than post fitting headlines.
"stocks decline over trade war concerns" or
"stocks plunge over yields"
2240 2018-12-05 00:39:19 European stocks fell on Tuesday as concerns about growth, doubts about the US-China trade truce, and a rising British pound dampened sentiment. Large falls were seen in the German auto sector as @Volkswagen slumped 3.0%, @Daimler fell 2.9% and @BMW lost 1.6%.
2241 2018-12-05 00:38:40 Technology stocks saw further losses as @Apple slumped 4.4% after a broker downgraded the stock, it was “too late to sell, too early to buy”, Micron Technology plunged 7.8%, @NVIDIA dropped 7.6%, @Amazon -5.9%, @Intel and Alphabet -4.8%, @Twitter slid 3.3% and @facebook -2.2%.
2242 2018-12-05 00:38:34 Easy peasy. Confusion over Trump Chinese trade policy, He says one thing China another after summit. Tweets "Tariffs"... stocks drop.
2243 2018-12-05 00:37:56 I wish I could take you over to $GXY.AX with me.

You may have gotten some potatoes in your sack over there, even though the Santa rally is yet to really break out.

I hope that you can get those rallying good $$$ from your stocks.
2244 2018-12-05 00:37:31 Those who are shorting stocks. Mind you, shorting stocks isn't wrong or nefarious. It's just playing the other side of the trade. But if you get private news about a stock that's going to tank and then short it, that would be a case of insider trading—and that can land u in jail.
2245 2018-12-05 00:37:10 Stocks sink again today for zero reason
2246 2018-12-05 00:36:46 You were correct Sir. Not many other stocks in the green today. :-)
2247 2018-12-05 00:36:40 What about an 800-point drop in stocks?
2248 2018-12-05 00:36:08 US stocks fell sharply on Tuesday, as skepticism mounted over the significance of an agreement reached by the US and China to postpone new tariffs and as the market digested a flattening yield curve, which is often an indicator of an upcoming economic slowdown.
2249 2018-12-05 00:36:07 Cutting Corporate tax-rates, Manufacturing tax-rates and Capital Gains tax-rates might lower foods prices as well as costs that go to Medicaid and Medicare, and create more tax-paying companies with tax-paying stocks and bonds! 
2250 2018-12-05 00:35:45 I like how Donald the #TariffMan trying to do damage control after his tweet sending stocks nosedived #LOL
2251 2018-12-05 00:35:32 How’d your stocks do today, @LouDobbs ??
2252 2018-12-05 00:34:48 Only if you actually make the trade. Lol
If you read back on my commentary I went to cash in September before the crash. The night of and 3 days thereafter I was awake to capitalize on the drop. Also why I've spent nearly no time commenting on Long stocks, charts, projections etc
2253 2018-12-05 00:34:48 Lol the more they speak the more I want less stocks! The market has a way of forcing suits to do what probably is bad for us all long term!
2254 2018-12-05 00:34:43 Itu paling win untuk Jose Villa. Semuabeli gmbr dia..damn...skrg aku phm knp wedding artis malaysia atas gunung ada photographer mrh org lain ambil. Mungkin dia nak jual stocks photo.
2255 2018-12-05 00:34:26 What are you talking about? There’s other crypto’s out there you know, and it will go back up, i guess you don’t understand how stocks work.
2256 2018-12-05 00:34:06 How’s those Stocks? Dropping again for your irresponsibly deals and confusing tweets. What a loser. You don’t get what tariffs are about.
2257 2018-12-05 00:33:13 Let me explain it to you. Thanks to heavy shorting those margin calls on plunging stocks force shorts to cover Tesla. That is why Tesla stocks is not falling down. Once it will be done (and it will) the stock will plunge 30-50% a day, and remember my words.

Although I said we made a treuce, we are right in the same place we were before. Let me reassert my narrow point of view while our stocks plunge, we lose jobs, and our goods cost more.
2259 2018-12-05 00:32:43 Yep. Trend-following quant funds just dumped U.S. stocks, according to Nomura 

The trend is not your friend in today’s languishing stock market - and that’s an understatement.

Trend-following quant funds are shedding over $50 billion in notional exposure to U.S. equities,.
2260 2018-12-05 00:32:42 Actually I am short on the stocks right now, so I need more tariffs so that the markets will fall.
2261 2018-12-05 00:30:53 What about it?  Stocks go up, stocks go down. Rarely does it matter all that much to working people. Investor and speculator jitters are not what economic policy should be based on. Most of them can afford losses every now and then. The loss of entire industries affects workers.
2262 2018-12-05 00:30:45 And Lithium stocks still lagging overall. Makes no sense. $DJIFF
2263 2018-12-05 00:30:40 Greedy Scottish Tory fishermen will fish the sea bare again. Protecting fish stocks isn't worth the hassle to Westminster.

2265 2018-12-05 00:30:08 Bet on the wrong stocks again. Ouch babe
2266 2018-12-05 00:29:47 oooh the Raley's here stocks different flavors of Ramune, time to experiment.
2267 2018-12-05 00:29:00 Want to see stocks surge again? Resign!
2268 2018-12-05 00:28:55 Just saw from @theinformation that perhaps for first time ever Apple is heavily discounting the iPhone.  Whoa!  Could lead to another major down leg in FANG stocks.  And maybe lead to a humbler, more customer-friendly Apple which actually might lead to more iphone sales.
2269 2018-12-05 00:28:46 Obviously you don’t own stocks.
2270 2018-12-05 00:28:45 Thats why most of your open positions are closed to new highs. When you time the short term bottom in indices, you buy strong stocks. Makes perfect sense. No need to chase stocks like $aapl $nflx $fb $baba

2272 2018-12-05 00:27:59 Either way, America wins. Btw lefties looking at the stocks, look at stocks from 2 years ago, stocks have been on the rise the duration of the Trump presidency.
2273 2018-12-05 00:27:12 Hm, I saw stocks go down 3% and the dollar decline against the pound and euro AGAIN. Are you, per chance, living in bizarro world?
2274 2018-12-05 00:27:02 I think he is trying to say focus on the stocks not INDEX
2275 2018-12-05 00:26:57 You sound like Trump congrats on that!  America isn’t booming & headed for a slow down at the minimum, or recession at worst!  See the stocks fall today?  Paris has been in the news continually.  Please stop spreading lies and division.  Hint:  Socialism is not Marxism!
2276 2018-12-05 00:26:38 Nothing!  It has to do with whatever stocks are set up in 2018.
2277 2018-12-05 00:25:44 Pro tip: You're not going to calm the markets by simply repeating what already sent stocks plunging - quite the opposite. Your consistent refusal to engage with the realities of the situation (and that TARIFFS ARE PAID BY AMERICANS) cannot be tolerated by business or investors.
2278 2018-12-05 00:25:38 I guess you’re trying to buy some stocks at discount because your tweets are driving the market down!
2279 2018-12-05 00:25:26 wouldn't call it shopworn soy yet -- tis this year's harvest, the alternative is stored stocks in China (i assume)

2281 2018-12-05 00:24:46 I'm down 60% in stocks... well I'm up 20% but I WAS as 80% 30 days ago... bout to convert it all to Bitcoin haha
2282 2018-12-05 00:24:21 Stocks down 800 today. We don’t either.
2283 2018-12-05 00:24:11 Anyone who did not begin to divest of stocks with this moron’s election - asked for what is to come.
2284 2018-12-05 00:24:04 Young sir, it’s my market you want to ruin from this tweet? My stocks are even dropping.
2285 2018-12-05 00:24:03 Let's let the uncertainty screw with the stocks some more. Losing the gains you said were your doing. Will you take responsibility for the losses? Yea, head in the sand. Predictable.
2286 2018-12-05 00:23:46 Fears of Brexit problems also weighs on U.S. Stocks today.
2287 2018-12-05 00:23:38 Time to kidnap some stocks and extrajudicially send them Turkey
2288 2018-12-05 00:23:18 Remember when money markets "broke the buck?" market confidence hit the elvator down to triple sub basements at 200West and all points inbetween globally who were holding all the "paper" based on confidence, new value for stocks Par .01, spiral down to sp 666, coincidence? NO
2289 2018-12-05 00:23:11 Remember: Figure out how you’re losing your stocks and how you’re taking theirs - try and focus on this mid match (start w friendlies)
2290 2018-12-05 00:22:50 Stocks are down 800 points today. 

Three of the four biggest drops ever are on your watch. 

So much “winning,” we’re sick of it already.
2291 2018-12-05 00:22:48 Says the guy who can't even take 2 stocks off me in 8 hours
2292 2018-12-05 00:22:22 playing chicken with china tariffs is causing chaos-you're good at this-keep it up and you'll drive stocks to new lows-and of course you'll blame china for YOUR stupidity
2293 2018-12-05 00:21:30 @OIGFedCFPB  Bank of Harlan, Harlan Kentucky Active Organized Crime! Board of directors Aware Since 2008! Inquiry request, Attorney Otis Doan Complicity/Fake Documents! Stolen Escrow!  Stop the WAR against Consumer's FOIA @KYSupremeCourt JohnDMinton Stocks?
2294 2018-12-05 00:21:20 You're really looking back to the 80s? We didn't have internet & had to mail a form to buy/sell stock. What other variables exist? This is complete bullsh*t. Rates were 16% in 82 & have never been this low with inverted curve. It's a bullish signal. #Stocks Dont get it twisted.
2295 2018-12-05 00:21:14 How’s the stocks doing today Mr. Tariff Man??!!
2296 2018-12-05 00:20:55 Damnn  Vegas shooting George sorros exited all of his positions in MGM & other Vegas resorts.. then shorted the stocks all before the shooting..
2297 2018-12-05 00:19:38 Got any investments left. At Tuesday's market close there was blood in the streets. Stocks, Wall Street tumble into the depths of hell.
2298 2018-12-05 00:19:37 Trump needs to shut eff up. My stocks are getting destroyed. #dow #china #tarifftalks #tradewar #stoptweeting
2299 2018-12-05 00:19:00 Mark,  where did you put stops in those stocks?  Thank you very much.
2300 2018-12-05 00:18:57 Stocks in a free fall again today. -600 points.

Good job, Trump. Thanks, fucker.
2301 2018-12-05 00:18:01 Hedge funds and major trading companies are spinning stocks within nanoseconds of a Tweet. They create these sell-offs to make money and don’t need advanced notice.
Aunt Mary trading reactively in her Schwab account or a 401k being *managed by a second tier firm get reamed.
2302 2018-12-05 00:15:57 $US FUTURES trying to show some strength and consequently plenty off stocks teasing a reversal after the dump this AM. GLA
2303 2018-12-05 00:15:41 What a day! Market clearly sends Fed a message. After squeezing  the shorts, stocks hit a pause zone. Today, long term yields and equities declined, need to see the follow through. We also have a death cross w/ 50 and 200 day moving averages on many major indices. $SPX $RUT
2304 2018-12-05 00:15:40 Its worse than guesswork, its political interference. Mark Carney needs to be put in stocks outside parliament
2305 2018-12-05 00:15:33 @realDonaldTrump “stocks in a free fall???”  Why aren’t you tweeting this?  #ticktock
2306 2018-12-05 00:15:30 A lot of stocks look UGLY right now....
2307 2018-12-05 00:15:10 Voter suppression should mandate time in the stocks before a capital building, loss of birth citizenship with banishment from the continental US for 10 years and prohibition from public office for life--or the option of being sent to a battle front. #antiquity #treason #despotism
2308 2018-12-05 00:15:04 I put a freeze on my stocks awhile back. I am hoping to retire in a year. I knew this would happen.
2309 2018-12-05 00:14:33 In just the past couple of years alone, the Gun ConTrolls were going on about "We Only Want The Bump Stocks" and the NRA went to the table, were presented with a laundry list of arms they wanted banned and walked away. Why? Because they lied...again. Exactly what are we getting?
2310 2018-12-05 00:14:10 Leading stocks bottom ahead of the general market. If you pick the right names, the market could make a lower low and even have a last leg down, but your stops hold. This happened to me in 1990 and during several other market declines.
2311 2018-12-05 00:13:53 Your talking about stocks and investments
2312 2018-12-05 00:13:12 Stocks are down....again because of you.
2313 2018-12-05 00:12:36 Nearly 1,000 stocks closed today down 4%+ while less than 30 closed up 4%+. It.s been a long long time since I've seen a day like this. Further what had seemed to be a pretty convincing 2nd rally attempt is likely going to end in failure. Feels very much like a bear market to me!
2314 2018-12-05 00:12:04 People always panic. Calm down, this up and down in the market happens. But, Merry Christmas to me! Putting those cheap stocks in my Christmas Stocking! Ho, ho, ho 
2315 2018-12-05 00:11:26 They should just abandon it already. Stocks are dropping and they had weak first week sales. What's there to hope for?
2316 2018-12-05 00:11:11 Stocks have risen in value because of the Fed printing money. The growing asset prices in US are an illusion based on nothing really. Even the GDP growth might end up being an illusion.
2317 2018-12-05 00:11:02 If you’re short stocks....
2318 2018-12-05 00:10:36 Theres a movement to actually delete/log off for 24 hours on the 17th and watch their stocks go down.
2319 2018-12-05 00:10:34 Trump tweeted that he was “Mr. Tariff Man” causing a huge 800 point drop of the DJIA.  
Wondering how much cash his kids & cronies pocketed as they shorted stocks today?
Hoping the SEC looks into this very deeply! 
Given Trump’s sleazy history, it certainly makes sense.
2320 2018-12-05 00:10:31 How did you determine that tech stocks are overvalued and at what price, exactly, will you jump back in?
2321 2018-12-05 00:10:26 Can someone just explain why the stocks keep going completely red so often? When I asked an investor abt it he sort of go angry at me. IDK why. I'm almost brand new to investing & I'm worried abt it bc it's not only my money at stale.
BTW how's Obama the only moron here?
2322 2018-12-05 00:09:48 Not fun for those trading stocks. Bwahahahaha
2323 2018-12-05 00:09:18 “Pop culture and celeb drama is boring. I need more stocks and science news in my timeline” someone find the real Anna Whitlock cuz this ain’t her
2324 2018-12-05 00:08:39 Stocks fell more than 3% over truce in the U.S.-China trade war. The yield curve — the difference between the interest rates on short- and long-term Treasury bonds — is at its narrowest level since 2007, in what some see as an ominous sign for the economy. (Via @nytimes)
2325 2018-12-05 00:08:17 The stock market plunged Tuesday as President Donald Trump fueled trade-war jitters and a slump in longer-term U.S. bond yields wreaked havoc on the bank stocks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.1%. The S&P 500 fell 3.24%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.8%.
2326 2018-12-05 00:08:03 It's why I'm long on very few stocks atm.
My JP managed accounts have short bias also and red is my favourite colour ATM because mixing short with red makes green lol
2327 2018-12-05 00:08:02 The stocks are so '80s.
2328 2018-12-05 00:07:33 $GC gold stocks, only buy the outperforming names relative to peers. My relative strength chart shows $SBM is and has been for a while the outperformer.
Always be prepared to pay up for quality, some names are cheap for a reason.
2329 2018-12-05 00:06:58 The broad and deep sell-off, combined with a shortage of fresh breakouts by high-quality growth stocks, triggered a downgrade in the current outlook for the U.S. stock market to "uptrend under pressure." >>>
2330 2018-12-05 00:05:49 Asian stocks open down slightly more than 1%, shrugging off the Tuesday tantrum in the US.
2331 2018-12-05 00:05:20 2 month return on what? Stocks?
2332 2018-12-05 00:04:36 If you don’t like your stocks because you are sure this recession will start tomorrow, please send those stocks to me. I’ll care for them well.
2333 2018-12-05 00:02:27 My pizza cutter came from Vancouver. Not every FC stocks the same items. I've been trying to get something delivered from YYC1 but it hasn't happened yet
2334 2018-12-05 00:02:25 Stocks definitely the next level

2337 2018-12-05 00:01:24 Stifel chief market strategist on markets.......forecasting 2800 top in S&P for 2019 and recession in 2020.....next hike will invert the curve. Also forecasting 3% compound returns for the next decade. That's a cheery thought. Likes bond proxies instead of SPY stocks! Go figure!
2338 2018-12-05 00:00:59 A lot of companies move to other places to save on prices of workers and materials, and to escape possible retaliation from a man who causes stocks to fluctuate pretty frequently, sometimes in extreme ways. Why stay in a country where tomorrow you could be punished for nothing
2339 2018-12-05 00:00:50 After a strong sell of overnight of key markets in Europe, USA and Asia, we are seeing opportunity for a bounce back in the Europe and US markets today. We are currently investigating for opportunities.

2341 2018-12-05 00:00:03 doesn't even work well in international markets either . US stocks are an anomaly
