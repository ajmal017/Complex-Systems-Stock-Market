3 2018-10-29 23:58:58 Is there a way to buy stocks under your company?
4 2018-10-29 23:58:43 To those that bought $kgn at >$9, just curious what other stocks you are liking or holding at the moment.
5 2018-10-29 23:58:12 I’ll be tracking, but I see stocks sliding all over
6 2018-10-29 23:57:29 Your "investment" is actually often loans.  Example, when they buy US govt bonds they are loaning us money, we are going further in debt.  When they buy assets like stocks or real estate then the profits on those accrue to them.  All this means we are poorer.

12 2018-10-29 23:55:07 The next speculative market will be biotech stocks that help treat acute flaccid myelitis.
13 2018-10-29 23:54:59 Looking at the market reports today citing the effect of “tech stocks” made me wonder: why are they “tech?” I think I know, but, if you were to tag Facebook, Twitter, Google (Alphabet), or Amazon by their PRODUCTS, how would they be categorized?
14 2018-10-29 23:54:41 He should ban bump stocks, AR-15 and all assault rifles. Only the police and military should have those.
15 2018-10-29 23:53:39 lol. It cracks me up to see what some of these guys are saying. Even more sad are the guys who bought something like canopy in the single digit range and made a ton of money thinking they know how to trade stocks. I feel bad for the average investor/trader.
16 2018-10-29 23:53:17 There's no reason to touch any of these stocks until gold is $1500+
17 2018-10-29 23:53:15 ...and now that investors are seeing the truth about the tax scam, stocks are dropping fast. Currently negative for the year. Nicely done, dumbass. You killed the longest bull run in history. That’s talent right there.

42 2018-10-29 23:49:14 Lower interest rates = more cheap money for stock buybacks = stocks pump
43 2018-10-29 23:48:09 Jerome Powell, Fed Chairman Reserve, is forcing the stocks to fall.  He's out there saying our interest rates are going to continue to go up.  Makes me curious as to why he's doing this one week before the midterms. He's a Republican, but some of them are in sheep's clothing.
44 2018-10-29 23:47:49 @marthamaccallum @SusanLiTV knows nothing. These people are total hacks. Analysts ask "could tariffs be a headwind" and the CEOs say "could be" then then they report that the economy is tanking. Bunch of bloggers and floor girls. Meanwhile cos raising revs and stocks tanking
45 2018-10-29 23:47:41 Hey, it's other peoples' money. Why not pay $34 billion for $260 million of earning power? It's the only way to keep tech stocks up.
46 2018-10-29 23:47:15 I only use monthly charts. Be patient find multi year lows in good stocks. And then just simply hold no matter what you hear around you.
If one checks in the nifty 200 stocks, it's seen that within a couple of years returns are extremely good.
47 2018-10-29 23:45:58 $SPY I'm not a diehard bear but the ease of reading $UVXY compared to most individual stocks; in itself continues to be a big red flag.
48 2018-10-29 23:45:31 As a virologist I  concentrate on the virus part, but you're right, leprosy is treatable.
We would be totally flat-footed if smallpox took hold.
Vaccine stocks very limited, and antivirals are experimental.
49 2018-10-29 23:45:25 I wish that @realDonaldTrump would end all interviews or talking to the media. He will never get a pad on the back.  Just like the stocks down and why to help DemonRats.  God is above all watch His moves
50 2018-10-29 23:45:08 Sometimes I just have to sit at the sidelines and wait for that optimal trade - I feel like the madza commercial watching some of the stocks on my list “zoom zoom” 
51 2018-10-29 23:44:05 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
52 2018-10-29 23:43:56 Are we going UP  tommorow #DowJones ? It should rally the market is oversold companies that have a blown earnings and guidance are getting hammered $rtn, $noc, $lmt $whr etc . A great day tommorow for high quality stocks .. IMO! @jimcramer
53 2018-10-29 23:43:52 Penny stocks been driving me crazy for the last week I got a win today and a refined strategy though so I'm ready to go on a run again #thanever
54 2018-10-29 23:43:32 What the Hell? Stocks up 300 down 245 in one day and every other day - IRRATIONAL and only pundit gibberish as to why. Answer is: FRAUDULENT MANIPULATION of stock buying and selling by those who can...  @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @cvpayne
55 2018-10-29 23:43:27 One of my long-term financial objectives is to own stocks, my favorite asset, which I do. But... I don't want to become dependent on the stock market. I want enough non-stock assets to keep me going during extreme bear markets.
56 2018-10-29 23:43:05 Yall be adding scopes, stocks, and extended clips for what? It’s still a pistol my guy 
57 2018-10-29 23:42:26 Look up 80% of the stocks in the stock market, and you’ll see the same trend. Nothing to see here.
58 2018-10-29 23:42:18 When we gonna see a recovery in the MMJ stocks?
59 2018-10-29 23:40:31  Found these #stocks that hit all-time highs: $BSBR
60 2018-10-29 23:40:20 While y’all distracted by @realDonaldTrump ‘s usual enemy of the people crap you’re missing the real reason he needs his own headlines, the economy.  Stocks routed, markets peaked, 401k’s tank, job losses in 3-6 months, debt crisis after. No cushion for US debt coz of #taxscam
61 2018-10-29 23:39:49 Interest rates are increasing and you have these #tech companies that are either not cash flow positive and/or heavily reliant on leverage. These ones should be the first stocks you're looking to short! Interest Rate hikes + Company +Over-Leveraging = Rekt. #FANG #trading #stocks
62 2018-10-29 23:38:41 so buyers just had to own stocks as they were plunging 20 mins before the bell.
of course.
moar Brooklyn Bridges pls
63 2018-10-29 23:38:07 The surge in price of $LBTY proves that individual stocks can buck a downward market but $FWONK has failed to do so for the past month and stockholders have LOST $1.2 BILLION of value as a result
64 2018-10-29 23:35:47 All those grumbling $AMZN employees should be thinking that the increased pay and cash incentives are far better compensation than the stock incentives they used to get. No one thinks stocks like Amazon could ever drop in value until it's too late.
65 2018-10-29 23:35:46 Dow Jones Chart Hints Reversal as Trade War Fears Amplify Selloff: US stocks followed Europe higher until the revival of US China trade war fears hurt Dow Jones prices, but the chart warns of a reversal. The ASX 200, Nikkei 225 may follow Wall Street lower.
66 2018-10-29 23:35:02 I've been sticking to stocks that are at or near their all-time-highs with a strong 5yr growth rate.  I've picked up several over the past month as even this group is having dips.  ...not a whole lot of selling tho.
67 2018-10-29 23:34:52 Lol same here but all tech stocks are going down every day it’s crazy man mine as well look for a spot to start buying once it hits 1400’s tomorrow. Or who knows could be 1100 by Friday.
68 2018-10-29 23:34:14 i think some people 'planned' to buy the markets and stocks early today and hold them overnight.  whoops.  we are in the moving business, not the storage business.
69 2018-10-29 23:34:04 Ryan.  There is easier money. Think pot stocks.
70 2018-10-29 23:33:30 Simply put the last place Bills are a mess and one of the laughing stocks of the NFL. The Patriots offense is clicking on all cylinders, they will Win their 5th straight game tonight. 38-17.
71 2018-10-29 23:33:14 #UKSausageWeek Definitely your Pork & Apple! My mum always stocks up at the shows but they were sold out last time sadly :( they're delicious! x
72 2018-10-29 23:33:08 I'd hesitate to either credit him for it being up or going down at this point in time. Unless we want to talk about specific stocks such as steel. Plus the stock market isn't the economy. The economy he's definitly hurting - long term.
73 2018-10-29 23:33:01 Amazon stocks dropped 6%.

74 2018-10-29 23:32:16 U.S. stocks fell overnight, with the benchmark S&P 500 index ending close to confirming its second correction of 2018. The Dow Jones fell 245.39 points to 24,442.92, the S&P 500 lost 17.44 points to 2,641.25 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 116.92 points to 7,050.29.
75 2018-10-29 23:31:52 Not too long ago I’d think this was a joke 
76 2018-10-29 23:31:03 Perhaps his followers will wake up, finally, since they’re getting hit where it hurts the most, right in the pocket/book! He always brags about stocks, my God lots of folks work 2 jobs to get by and own NO STOCKS & BONDS!! What world does Trump live in anyway. He’s out of touch.
77 2018-10-29 23:30:17 I have gone blind looking at the downhill heading stocks. My bad..
78 2018-10-29 23:29:42 Damn the last thing I'd do is let IBM pick stocks for me and charge 75bps a year too
79 2018-10-29 23:29:03 @MomsDemand @womensmarch @MomsRising @GiffordsCourage Need you here! Background checks & no bump stocks IS NOT radical gun control , its common sense! Stop your lies!
80 2018-10-29 23:28:50 6 Rem. Stocks: 130 companies, S&P 500, quarter of benchmark inches... Facebook, GE, And Aetna all come in tomorrow... GM: Wednesday... Also, Apple, DowDu
Int, Starbucks... Thursday: CBS, Alibaba, ExxonMobil, Berkshire Hathaway, on Friday... The October
81 2018-10-29 23:28:33 this works almost 50% of the time every time with pot stocks
82 2018-10-29 23:28:22 Always trade leading stocks of leading industries. If there is no leader, don’t trade.
83 2018-10-29 23:28:14 $SPY We already know what could happen and if this happened etc. So it's rather refreshing now and then to see someone simply go with probability instead of always using the word but at the end of their prediction only to look good no matter what direction stocks/markets go.
84 2018-10-29 23:27:19 Grumbling ceased. Seeing all my cannibus and tech stocks continue to crash is hard to see. I need to change my perspective. Thanks for the reminder!
85 2018-10-29 23:27:00 C'est là où tu te trompes, la production du oneplus 6 est finie, ce qui reste ce sont les stocks des grossistes chinois.
Y'a jamais deux modèles en même temps en production.
86 2018-10-29 23:26:27 US stocks have fallen in a volatile session, with the S&P 500 ending just shy of confirming its second correction of 2018, hurt by fresh worries of an escalation of US-China trade tensions and a sharp drop in big tech and Internet names

88 2018-10-29 23:24:55 Yea I’ve seen too many sell too soon bc prop taxes buried them. It’s said how they can manipulate the market like that. It’s not shoe in but it’s easier than stocks for most people.
89 2018-10-29 23:24:52 shit that excited me as a kid: video games, trampolines, theme parks
shit that excites me as an adult: WALMART STOCKS RAINBOW CARROTS
90 2018-10-29 23:24:51 Stocks go down violently. Yea we've all seen that and know that. So that makes it better? I don't get it...
91 2018-10-29 23:24:47 Economy and stocks seeing record highs in many categories.
92 2018-10-29 23:24:16 $SPY Trading is fast pace enough buying stocks low prior to the rallies (burst) Can't imagine what those that are chasing are going through.
93 2018-10-29 23:23:54 @RobinhoodApp I get notifications the day of/before my stocks earnings reports that take me to an upcoming earnings page in the app, but I can't seem to find this without the notification. Is it hidden somewhere I haven't looked or is the notification the only way to get there?
94 2018-10-29 23:23:48 I came into the day long about 20% quality stocks and 5% Index Calls, I sold a lot by mid day, and I still feel like absolute garbage...I think its mostly because the delta from open to close was so high, really only lost about a percent...but sheesh...time for a drink!
95 2018-10-29 23:23:16 “You would assume it becomes easier to buy stocks when they’re falling but cash is a comfortable place to be during a correction. It’s like you’re tucked in under your warm comforter on a freezing Saturday morning in the winter and you never want to get out of bed.” @awealthofcs
96 2018-10-29 23:22:50 People on the brink of retirement aren't holding enough stocks in their 401(k) to be impacted. Or if they are, they're idiots.
97 2018-10-29 23:22:12 @NYCPunter figures the only two  stocks doing good on my watch  list is target  and. Starbucks
98 2018-10-29 23:21:26 Wondering if holding with trend is better than scalping. I have been scalping for some times as I learnt from you, but the commissions are just so much than holding with trend in stocks. But I like scalping from your approach sir.

104 2018-10-29 23:16:47 You can say that about most stocks these days. Stop spreading fear. We don’t care. $ACB $APH $CGC
105 2018-10-29 23:16:21 Stocks tanking. Are you shorting stocks?
106 2018-10-29 23:16:07 I’d hate to be a FA right now and telling your clients ETF allocations and how they are over exposed to 10-15 stocks...  but I thought ETFs were diversified???
107 2018-10-29 23:15:51 Hundreds of records were broken. 98%+ stocks made all-time highs, but as the mrkt cont'd upward, those records were broken again... as almost always happens. But Trump knew most of his followers were naïve and carefully worded his BS to make himself the Star. Just like Hitler did
108 2018-10-29 23:15:49 it's all a long and elaborate plan to blow my life savings on some twitter stocks then force them to keep it
109 2018-10-29 23:15:19 Tech stocks, keep going down and we get to go shopping
110 2018-10-29 23:15:05 What do you consider to be the most powerful fundamentals in predicting future stock returns for bank stocks? ROE, ROA, PB, PE, deposit growth?
111 2018-10-29 23:14:23 $FNV $ABX Right know I'm thinking about those 2 stocks that may be green :)
112 2018-10-29 23:14:13 A rated from the NRA.   Supports keeping bump stocks and AR15s on the streets and in the hands of crazed angry men.   No thanks Katie!!

114 2018-10-29 23:12:56 Stocks plunged as DISH Network Corporation unveiled a obliging egg beater today.
115 2018-10-29 23:12:38 The ups and downs of the stock market in the short run don’t really tell us much about the overall health of the economy.  October in an election year is always dicey, tech stocks were vastly overvalued and the Fed is moving on interest rates.  Better to take a longer term view.
116 2018-10-29 23:12:24 Lamela The once-beloved FANG stocks are putting the tech-heavy Nasdaq on track for its worst month in a decade.…
117 2018-10-29 23:12:21 $DBX I do not see how even the earning could change this or other stocks outlook, Unless FED and TRUMP do/say something; lets say we are heading back to pre-trump presidency levels.
118 2018-10-29 23:11:48 2009:     I Will Never Buy stocks Again

2017:       Never Selling
2018:       Never!

10/ 2018:    Never buying stocks again 


119 2018-10-29 23:11:39 Stocks are almost always volatile in October. Things will shift around again soon.
120 2018-10-29 23:11:22 I'm slightly under the influence of marijuana so my judgement may not be the best but I would invest stocks in that company
121 2018-10-29 23:10:31 Not in banking stocks, they are buying these
122 2018-10-29 23:10:29 planning?  wait a minute...you MAKE stocks do what you want them to do?  that's a new one!
123 2018-10-29 23:09:43 Which shows that this post 08 bubble reflation is unprecedented. Japan had rates to zero + QE. Did its stocks or real estate reflate ? Hell no. But ppl claim today that it was such an easy call to hella long because you know QE.
124 2018-10-29 23:09:16 $EA adding insult to injury; wondering now how bad it can get. They issued a downgrade into this tape. WOW talk about kicking a company when they are down.  Unless in next month FED and TRUMP give in we will be sitting on these high flying stocks for years to come -
125 2018-10-29 23:09:03 Obama:Economy gained net 11.6 M jobs
Took over Bush Unemployment rate of 9.6%
Obama Unemployment dropped to 4.8%
Wkly earnings up 4%
corp. profits/stocks set records. S&P 500 up166%
W/O health insurance down 15M.
Wind&solar power up 369%
CO down11%
Murder lowest on record in 2014
126 2018-10-29 23:07:56 The Dow Jones Industrials comprises 30 stocks. The NASDAQ comprises thousands. The S&P 500 as you might guess comprises 500. Same with the Russell 2000. Actually, historically, the stock market usually is a good indicator of what will happen in the economy in about 6 months.

I don’t know how to break it to you, but Tesla’s stocks are plummeting. 
Don’t you worry for a second though. I got it under control.
All I’m gonna need is your credit card number, the expiration date, and the three numbers on the back.
Hurry before Tesla goes bankrupt!
131 2018-10-29 23:02:16 I moved a bunch of stocks to bonds last night. This shit show isn’t over.

134 2018-10-29 23:00:36 No they dont. More than half the country wants coverage they can afford that provides them with protection from future problems while not excluding or gouging them for preexisting conditions. Insurance companies will NEVER EVER provide that. Stocks up, CEO pay up, gen wages not

147 2018-10-29 22:51:22 My stocks has been taking a beat for a couple of weeks already
148 2018-10-29 22:50:05 Bump stocks are makeshift additions and not part of the original weapon design. As is, and of themselves, they are dangerous to to the operator and unreliable. Yes, they should not be permitted.
149 2018-10-29 22:49:52 One great indicator is the T2108 chart of % of stocks above 40dmas. It currently is near 11%, the same level reached at Feb lows. A short term bottom is near.
150 2018-10-29 22:49:40 $CGC the news articles group stocks link tlry to CGC which is bullshit the only reason $TLRY went so hit is bc a short selling dickhead got fucked and has been slowly selling it off.
151 2018-10-29 22:47:50 Makes sure all Floridians vote blue to save all America from this madness. Stocks crashing, racist terrorists on the loose and were sending troops where? Duh?
152 2018-10-29 22:47:19 October is always miserable. I made a policy of avoiding the month altogether. It became a running joke among my subscribers about what I'd dredge up to write about every October instead of stocks.
153 2018-10-29 22:46:36 Since marijuana became legal on Oct. 17th, pot stocks have lost upwards of 45% of their value. Its now time to separate the losers from the winners. Those that ran a PR campaign vs those that are running a serious business.

161 2018-10-29 22:43:22 But I am still against @realDonaldTrump as our leader and bump stocks.

165 2018-10-29 22:40:06 Fee structures of an investment manager alone reveals the purpose of their business. If the goal is to provide value to his clients then he would not excessively toll via commissions. Investing can be a Positive-sum game of equitable sharing of dividends. #business #stocks #alpha

168 2018-10-29 22:38:39 Stocks are crashing.  Deficit is sky rocketing.  POTUS is creating havoc with his words.  Kids continue to shoot others in school.  Massacres continue in houses of worship.  But it’s all good cause the GDP is up.  Clueless idiots running this country.
169 2018-10-29 22:37:37 Stocks fell in Oct B4 midterms for 2 reasons: to KILL voters' "GREAT economy" belief & DESTROY #GOP @realDonaldTrump by attacking policies eg #tradewars; as extreme leftists via nefarious methods: revise history, attack Constitution & religions' virtues to destroy USA Democracy.
170 2018-10-29 22:37:13 What do you mean by "picking stocks"?  When you dip buy into a stock, you're picking stocks right?  Lol

Stocks do go down sometimes in booming markets.
Stocks do go up sometimes in floundering markets.

181 2018-10-29 22:34:08 "With that forward air," but it's only used in reference to attacks that are not forward air. This about to blow up like BTC in Janunary.

Also you have to remember that the slowdown effect is going to cause a lot less doubt over when stocks are taken.
182 2018-10-29 22:33:38 Maybe they 'trait' stocks, baseball cards, etc.
183 2018-10-29 22:32:55 I swear Jack just hides under his bed, and checks the stocks.
184 2018-10-29 22:32:48 There hasn’t been a single dip buy in the history that didn’t work. Thus, the only ways to lose are leverage and picking stocks.
185 2018-10-29 22:31:53 By the way, Baillie Gifford owns all the Nasdaq bubble-stocks that got slaughtered this month; it it really going to put MEANINGFULLY more money in $TSLA? Or is it just "verbally supporting" one of the few things in its book that isn't tanking?
186 2018-10-29 22:29:44 Stocks continued their intense fluctuation in the fourth quarter of the year, losing much of what they gained in the previous three quarters. Analysts are predicting they will settle for a last second field goal and then play for overtime. #SCnohands

Glee about a big tech merger sent stocks soaring Monday, but then dread about the threat of new tariffs on China sent them plunging.
189 2018-10-29 22:27:10 I hear about real estate,  
Just got into stocks last year,
Familiar with bonds and CDs but if not mistake there return is low.

191 2018-10-29 22:26:40 $AMZN trading $500 below high. Ballyhooed $1 trillion valuation seems so long ago. "#China stocks much worse than US.." "#China will cave". Got-some-splaining-to-do!
192 2018-10-29 22:26:25 Yes, YOU need to work. PASS SENSIBLE GUN LEGISLATION. As an Alaskan gun owner, I support universal background checks and an outright ban of AR-15s and bump stocks. We need more that your prayers.
193 2018-10-29 22:25:37 When everyone is hysterical about the next 1 Trillion dollar company and screaming pile in -- look first at the market and its overall risks.

When everyone is hysterical about the market (now) and how much lower it will go.....take a good look at some solid individual stocks.

199 2018-10-29 22:23:47 You promised universal background checks and banning bump stocks. What happened? NRA got your tongue? #TrumpLiesMatter #TrumpCrimeFamily
200 2018-10-29 22:23:02 Trump finds himself in tough spot today: cannot brag about stocks;  cannot stick to usual tone of divisiveness (hatred), has to disassociate himself w/ fox, so he sticks to the oldest trick: threaten china w/ more tariffs...

212 2018-10-29 22:17:06 All the stocks that led the breakout in September are getting slaughtered
213 2018-10-29 22:17:06 Dow now -340 points as tech Stocks fall and drag the broader markets lower.
214 2018-10-29 22:17:01 What do you mean by it? I think if $AMZN $GOOG $NFLX don’t come in and do stock buy back we will see more down. These stocks have been struggling since September. I thought buying $AMZN @1700 was a good deal. Look at where is it now?
215 2018-10-29 22:16:36 Stocks regain some steam. Pushing higher. NASDAQ once again positive.
216 2018-10-29 22:16:31 At midday, Stocks higher, off best levels. NASDAQ slips into negative territory. Mortgage Bonds lower. 10-yr yield 3.10%.
217 2018-10-29 22:15:56 Stocks shedding some gains.
218 2018-10-29 22:15:25 But it hasn't always been an easy catch, wild stocks declined in the twentieth century. The final test is the weight.

228 2018-10-29 22:11:14 IMO the sooner we stop with the CAD stocks trend the better I think we have some bigger catalyst on board. CAD stocks are getting hit with the sell on news after legalization + the overall market downtrend. US pot stocks are just at the beginning stages of defining themselves

234 2018-10-29 22:06:17 I don't subscribe to labels like passive aggressive because I won't allow myself to be a victim or labeled a bully. 
But again, the bump stock while allowing faster firing kept more bullets in the air than at the target. Saved lives
bump stocks came from a belt loop and thumb
235 2018-10-29 22:05:28 @senrobportman How is your study on bump stocks going? You promised this some time ago. Another lie.
236 2018-10-29 22:05:25 Cramer telling everyone to sell in 2000?   didnt he recommend 10 tech stocks to own forever??
237 2018-10-29 22:04:47 With the changes Trump has made it allows companies to be more profitable . In turn stocks gain and pay out greater dividends for their investors. I guess we will have to agree to disagree. Enjoyed talking with you. Hope you have a great evening.

249 2018-10-29 21:58:32 Seen far worse you remember post Greece stocks getting big game changing news and dropping 20% on news day. Its not great out there at mo but scalps about and still buying large for swings north. RPT loads at 41 RRE loads 5.50
250 2018-10-29 21:58:27 Josh, they weren't ever full auto. the bump stock did increase the fire rate but thank god at the same time probably is what kept more from getting shot. I'm fine outlawing bump stocks.
You are right, keeping guns out of deranged hands. Someone wanted all vets not to own any
251 2018-10-29 21:58:01 I don't truely understand the buying options with stocks, but seems like that would be the way to go. Bobby never has time so the relationship will suffer especially since

259 2018-10-29 21:54:11 Stocks are spiraling lower again, bonds are losing money and everything suddenly feels very shaky. Time to overhaul your financial plan, right?
260 2018-10-29 21:53:04 So... Now that Stocks have dropped, you're going to blame Trump and it's no longer Obama's? Great, So when the Stocks climb again, their will be no credit for Obama RIGHT? Just want to check before it climbs up again. 
BTW: Dow still above 24,000, What was it when Obama left?
261 2018-10-29 21:52:26 A week or two ago someone @ me with “remember when you told us not to buy weed stocks”

YES I DO AND IM STILL LAUGHING

263 2018-10-29 21:52:03 Tough day. Lots of stocks selling off and dipping.
264 2018-10-29 21:51:39 The stock market is just gambling—it's going to go back up as soon as rich people are all confident enough again that all the other rich people are going to leave their money in for a little longer.

But: remember when George W. Bush wanted to gamble Social Security on stocks?
265 2018-10-29 21:51:32 Zoie is just dumb that’s all I’ll say you play the stocks like a cat plays a piano...
266 2018-10-29 21:51:17 U.S. stocks close Monday 10/29/18: $DJIA -0.99% (-245.3) at 24,442.92, $SPX -0.66% (-17.4) at 2,641.25, $COMPQ -1.63% (-116.9) at 7,050.29.
267 2018-10-29 21:51:08 Barbra, she got those votes by busing people in to vote several times in several places. Illegals were told by wonderful Obuma to go and vote and don’t be afraid. Dead people got to vote as well. Don’t be a fool! I bet your stocks are doing great thanks to the man you hate.
268 2018-10-29 21:50:58 Imagine selling crypto at the bottom to buy stocks at the top 
269 2018-10-29 21:50:45 He is only looking at the last 10 years worth of data, all of which occurred within a bull cycle.  Bull markets have a 7 year life (average).  Trump extended that a bit but the world isn’t looking too great at the moment.  I’d buy crypto over stocks!!!
270 2018-10-29 21:49:54 My pot stocks have done so bad this past week I wish I still smoked it
271 2018-10-29 21:49:02 Appia has been doing quite well lately. Up and down a bit but volatility is the name of the name of the game for these stocks. Got a real boost today though. It was up to 29c in mid day trading. I am looking at it as a future NXE which I bought at 60c. A bargain at 25c IMHO.

280 2018-10-29 21:45:52 You trading tech stocks now?
281 2018-10-29 21:45:50 $AMZN and $NFLX could be penny stocks by Friday

283 2018-10-29 21:45:26 Market Close: MBS -9bps; DOW -245.39; NASDAQ -116.92; S&P 500 -17.44; 10yr Treasury 3.09%; Stocks end in the Red after being up a bit in morning trade (DOW was up over 200) and Yields subsided, remaining below the 25 DMA.
284 2018-10-29 21:44:01 US stocks fell in a volatile session, with the S&P500 hurt by fresh worries of an escalation of US-China trade tensions & a sharp drop in big tech. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 51 points lower at 5,653. #ausshares #stockmarket
285 2018-10-29 21:43:39 To be a successful speculative stock trader you have to do a lot of research and identify potential and prospective stocks and get in as early as possible after having your own due diligence . In most cases you will be successful if you do so

287 2018-10-29 21:42:53 if people are underwater I wonder how that will affect stocks during tax loss selling season

289 2018-10-29 21:42:09 You should be put in the stocks and pissed on.
290 2018-10-29 21:41:52 Stocks sank after a report that the U.S. administration is considering more tariffs on Chinese goods in December if the next round of negotiations between President Trump & Chinese leader Xi Jinping fail.
291 2018-10-29 21:41:35 Will sit back and watch till 2019, Will Buy oil stocks only if they go down to a level I am comfortable with and 6 percent DIV BP and RDSA!
292 2018-10-29 21:40:42 Sure, but I mean then you're just trading the buy side. If you don't buy and hold, aren't you a selling the rip? 

I want to park money in equities at a good price because, as mentioned, stocks go up over time. I just don't buy the damn top.

295 2018-10-29 21:39:34 Anyone care to provide commentary how trillions of dollars are changing hands in stocks while a much smaller market like gold cannot even muster a move of few dollars
296 2018-10-29 21:38:55 BTC was at $8400 or so late July. That's quite the drop. 

Low cap coins drop more in a bear market, just like low cap stocks drop more and/or rally more during bear or bull markets. Doesn't mean much.

Both BCH clients have strong backing. One wants ICOs. Other one doesn't.

303 2018-10-29 21:36:32 Bitcoin remains stable during the most volatile month for stocks in a decade - no word from Peter Schiff.

Bitcoin drops 2.4% on a day where stocks get pummeled and here comes Mr. Schiff to take another swing at that dead horse.
304 2018-10-29 21:36:29 Socialist, and he is...plus read the article....lol...proving the intelligence of Bob's supporters. Also ask him about pleading guilty with twitter stocks...that's a fun one too.

306 2018-10-29 21:35:26 Damn!  Looks like all those predictions by economist professionals are turning out to be correct.  Stocks are diving. GDP heading south instead of north. Debt skyrocketing.  You’re a 6 times bankrupt and convicted money launderer.  I guess it’s what we should have expected.

312 2018-10-29 21:33:14 That theory has been shown not to hold water. For instance, In the VA Tech shooting, he used 10 and 15 round magazines and killed 32, wounding 23.
More often, people don't take down the shooter when he's reloading, they run and end up dead.
One good move was banning bump stocks
313 2018-10-29 21:33:02 The current situation is complete non sense. Some stocks being savaged like this for no particular reason (economic signals are not that bad). Sometimes I wonder if indexes are not being manipulated in order for some State to be able to invest massively in discounted values. #LT
314 2018-10-29 21:32:23 LMAO I own 6 of 10 today Top Loser stocks on Robinhood

315 2018-10-29 21:32:05 Big picture repeat: rally in stocks is coming very soon imho, perhaps starting tomorrow. Everything gets a relief bounce along with it save bonds and perhaps the dollar. Then the #crash follows, all falls except $ and bonds. Then #Fed reversal and all soars except $. Next <6 mths
316 2018-10-29 21:31:29 - 2A is an individual right, not up for debate
- UBGs can’t be done without registration. We’re not doing it
- don’t care about bump stocks
- red flag is fine with legal representation for accused
- stored gun is useless in emergency
- suicide & LEO on crime is not gun violence
317 2018-10-29 21:30:49 I am excited to announce I have been selected by @tbohen for #TeamBohen in the @StocksToTrade @SteadyTrade Paper Trading challenge. I will be working hard to take home the title. Time to run the table on @Jonk87 and #TeamJonkers #LetsGo #AllWeDoIsWin #StockTrading
318 2018-10-29 21:30:33 Yes.  I support regulating guns, which is different form outlawing them.  I so not want to take guns, but make sure they are purchased by responsible owners who pass background checks.  Limit rounds of ammo for purchase.  no bump stocks
319 2018-10-29 21:30:23 Red flag laws are unconstitutional as they remove due process. Safe storage laws are effectively unenforceable since they require a warrant to even check. Bump stocks are effectively a range toy. None of these proposals are any kind of a solution to anything.

323 2018-10-29 21:26:25 aaaaaaaand the stocks are going down... lmao
324 2018-10-29 21:26:01 That's just what this market needs, a blurb coming across Bloomberg that says Berkshire has started building a stake in any of the FANG stocks.
325 2018-10-29 21:25:45 Also bump stocks are not a problem. Anyone can buy a 3D printer and make a bump stock. Banning something does NOT stop criminals from getting their hands on them.

327 2018-10-29 21:24:20 By all means, please belch out some more conspiratorial rhetoric to people who think like the MAGAbomber.  Let them have bump stocks for their AR-15s. What can possibly go wrong?

330 2018-10-29 21:23:14 I hate when bad things happen to good stocks .
331 2018-10-29 21:23:08 Media is full of bias, and always has been. But when the lying leads to false judgments about others, perpetuating fear and a superiority complex, & ppl kill because of it, I’m going to take a stand, period. So maybe sell off those stocks, my friend. Is that why your back is up?
332 2018-10-29 21:21:55 Everything is being dumped today it seems. Time to buy moar stocks.
333 2018-10-29 21:21:55 Bought large cap value and growth stocks today.  Will keep buying until alloted dry powder runs out. Its a healthy economy, after decline is followes by upside. This is for my long term account. Trading account not touched for many days now $spy $amzn $brk.b $v $aapl among others
334 2018-10-29 21:21:55 Shorting any high PE ratio and high P/free-cash-flow stocks these days would be immensely profitable.  

$NVDA was particularly over-valued, even more than $AMZN.

Good play. Cheers.
335 2018-10-29 21:21:22 i know ur excited about this, but my father has made millions in stock and it pains me to see u do this when u don't even know about the big 5 to put stocks into that always turn profit
336 2018-10-29 21:21:01 It is not Brexit! Please please please - look at European, Asian, Chinese and US money supply data. Stocks are falling globally not because of Brexit but because  global growt has slowed dramatically......u should know better!
337 2018-10-29 21:20:50 I’ve been avoiding checking on my stocks lately  i don’t want to cry.
338 2018-10-29 21:20:32 Stocks another tricky topic. I had stock in amazon, sold when they hit 1800. You never really make money unless the stocks go way up, like amazons did. google and apple on the other hand have been at a consistent level for a while now.
339 2018-10-29 21:19:17 Le scandale des laboratoires qui organisent des ruptures de stocks pour soulager leur trésorerie et plonger les grands malades dans la rupture d un traitement indispensable à leur vie!
340 2018-10-29 21:19:16 tefs just sent an email out about it. Apparently low liquid stocks now have to have a there cent buffer or something stupid
341 2018-10-29 21:19:12 What? Very worst case is investment actually goes to projects with real value in addition to $BTC. Also, even if it went fully "mainstream," which I dispute, people pour money into stocks after multi-year recessions. Ppl have super short memories, they just want gains.
342 2018-10-29 21:19:05 Man I'm losing so much money in stocks rights now

344 2018-10-29 21:18:10 I don't know if it's because I've been doing this for so long or what, but this latest market chaos isn't bugging me as much as it seems to be bugging some people. Stocks go up, stocks go down, and biotechs moreso on both ends. This too shall pass.
345 2018-10-29 21:18:09 Confidence is completely gone in stocks.   Going to  be extremely volatile till end of year.  We did however need this correction

352 2018-10-29 21:14:37 Probably becomes too inbred but stocks sounds like a possibility

Trying to manipulate values of the cards within the decks
353 2018-10-29 21:14:03 The equity volatility market is disagreeing with the equity cash market. If traders were really worried about an economic slowdown and protracted decline in stocks, longer-term volatility would be well-bid. Remember the XIV blow up?
354 2018-10-29 21:11:41 my stocks are tanking....wtf??? so much winning....

357 2018-10-29 21:10:16 Selon l'OMS, la variole ne survient plus de façon naturelle, mais des stocks de virus variolique sont encore conservés dans deux laboratoires de confinement renforcé.

358 2018-10-29 21:10:12 With only 9% of Chinese household assets in stocks (72% of savings in cash) vs 41% of US household assets, I wonder when the US will have to come to the table esp since it looks like Chinese aren’t in a hurry to negotiate.  S&P 500 has given back all of its gains this year.

362 2018-10-29 21:09:43 Please keep sending me personal messages telling me you have the easiest way to make millions in stocks and try to charge me monthly for it.. My fav.. “My mathematical approach will make you millions!!”  scamming.. a way to make money instead of actually knowing the market.
363 2018-10-29 21:08:31 y’all my loan is coming in november and i’m about to make so many smart financial moves with that!! 

we also get paid THREE times this month

and then two weeks after my loan, i’ll get 9 shares of stocks 
364 2018-10-29 21:08:03 So an honest company starts with an original intent & family name, sells for billions of dollars to a big corporation that has stocks in this company by hundreds of others who own shares. They add fluoride, GMO's, or whatever, still has same "trusted" family name. This is crazy
365 2018-10-29 21:07:35 Facts. I asked a friend of mind that’s wealthy when he go for a loan, what do the banks look at. He told me they base the loan based off his assets. His businesses, stocks, and etc tells them his ability to pay them back.
366 2018-10-29 21:07:01 @CNBCClosingBell 

Melissa  Staple stocks have held up very well. General Mills,  Phillip Morris, etc have held up very well and most were up today so how can you say there is no rotation into these types of Cos?
367 2018-10-29 21:06:34 I still haven't looked at any data for the stocks I have been trading lol all just on the TA.
368 2018-10-29 21:06:13 Itd also be harmful to my field too and none of us think it's actually happening unless Twitter wants to fuck up their stocks like tumblr did...... like I get the point they're making but like the issue isnt likes it's our politicians abusing a social media website LOL

372 2018-10-29 21:04:03 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-10-29, is 340.4053. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
373 2018-10-29 21:04:00 If you take a 20% gain in stocks due to tax cuts is as a given, current performance is dismal. Less than 4% growth per year.
374 2018-10-29 21:03:29 #Democrats manipulated #StockMarket via talking heads & caused plummet b4 2016 #ElectionDay, yet it SKYROCKETED DAY AFTER @realDonaldTrump elected. @DNC attempting same #failed play to undermine @POTUS & #GOP successes AND stocks will SKYROCKET again day after #Elections2018
375 2018-10-29 21:03:07 You forgot to mention the part about the stilts being made from the stocks of all of the guns we’re gonna grab.
376 2018-10-29 21:02:41 Yes but I think those stocks would have been up notably more today had we not had that putrid $IBM for $RHT deal.  LOL
377 2018-10-29 21:02:34 So #FANG stocks lost how much market cap? And people are worried about #Crypto
378 2018-10-29 21:02:30 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-10-29, is 334.85. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk
379 2018-10-29 21:01:48 One more day of losses and I'm buying all these stocks.
380 2018-10-29 21:01:21 Is marriage being destroyed because people have expressed disdain over men being allowed to beat their wives or throw them in stocks?
381 2018-10-29 21:01:20 @g_silberman @MarkYusko What do you hedge into when the #realestate & the #stocks bubble bursts AND the QE causes the $USD to tank?
382 2018-10-29 21:01:13 For the same reasons, we did not and do not own pot stocks. At this very early stage they are just gambling, not investments.

385 2018-10-29 20:58:47 Yes, our clients did not own them, just as they didn't own the dot-com stocks, either. Our clients hire us to be value investors and protect their hard earned money and earn them a decent return. Not to take undue risk chasing stocks at valuations that don't make sense.
386 2018-10-29 20:56:07 twitter replaces the like button with a "dislike" button, stocks plummet 2000 points
387 2018-10-29 20:54:37 Maybe he was full-on short stocks in October.  With leverage.
388 2018-10-29 20:54:32 Now watch him selling stocks I can guarantee that this is what is next
389 2018-10-29 20:53:43 Great going on stocks so far
390 2018-10-29 20:52:27 How are y’all flipping this money? Real estate? Stocks? Business?
391 2018-10-29 20:52:06 On the bright side liquor is up, and if MI & ND legalize pot, I’m plunging on cannabis stocks.
392 2018-10-29 20:51:39 Still, ETF's are down less compared to most specific stocks this month. Many stocks are near 52 weeks low.
393 2018-10-29 20:51:22 Number of leading stocks today: 5 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
394 2018-10-29 20:50:53 I trade stocks, but just flipped to shorting a week and a half or so ago. Been fine. Shorting stocks and longing BTC/alts nbd
395 2018-10-29 20:49:52 Short #stocks long $crypto . People like to think crypto will dump harder - it won’t. Most have accumulated already and are in profit from the bottom. This will creep crypto higher and traditional investors will see this and jump in to “secure” profits. I expect a crazy 2019. 1/2
396 2018-10-29 20:49:44 Well if interest rates can go negative, why can’t stocks? 
397 2018-10-29 20:49:40 GM stock went from $77 per share to $7 per share.  The smart money was out of stocks by then.
398 2018-10-29 20:49:28 Josh I keep giving my paycheck to the drug dealer down the street and he gave my 500 pieces of paper that say ‘weed stocks’ but how do I find out their value? Please help my family is  dying
399 2018-10-29 20:48:34 Half of all the stocks in the broad MSCI U.S. Equity Index are at least 20 percent below their 52-week highs.
400 2018-10-29 20:48:22 Last week, FAANG short sellers were up $1.3 billion in mark-to-market profits on Friday. There was increased short selling in the FAANG stocks throughout all of October - S3 data
401 2018-10-29 20:48:18 Primarily due to $IGC's delisting calling entire industry credibility into question at a weak point. Trading ceased 9:03am, minutes later all pot stocks halt increases & began to fall steadily through entire day. 200sma seemed to be the only thing to catch the falling knife!
402 2018-10-29 20:47:56 Dow down 10% from highs. 5-10% to go? This is healthy for the markets. Amazon down 25% so far. PEs way to high on some stocks. $AGY, $GLN
403 2018-10-29 20:47:36 True. But weird how market is dropping so hard and yet the stocks I choose to short breakdown and then reverse. Gonna pause this live account, until things make sense lol
404 2018-10-29 20:46:43 Next thing you know they'll be bustin' stocks on for glory.
405 2018-10-29 20:46:20 Now found a company named Edison and buy Tesla’s stocks.
406 2018-10-29 20:45:58 Investors/traders should know that #Trump is all-in on winning mid-terms at all costs. As if he knows #Mueller has got the goods. Needs US stocks and his ‘beautiful’ 401k spin to find support/bounce FAST. A bullish tweet on China trade is possible if not likely soon.
407 2018-10-29 20:44:46 Because I want to be filthy rich when the housing market crashes and stocks go down to the .618.     What kind of stupid question is that
408 2018-10-29 20:44:45 The bump stock was really the key to that. They are so inaccurate and help shoot so fast that its almost the perfect tool for a mass shooting. Anyone who defends people needing bump stocks want mass shootings to continue

411 2018-10-29 20:44:02 NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks close sharply lower in latest bout of volatility, putting S&P 500 on track for worst month since financial crisis.
412 2018-10-29 20:43:36 @realDonaldTrump feel that all your sheriff's and criminal justice are all corrupted. Get a grip of your country!. People will respect you more. (Steven Avery case) and he's still in prison. Laughing stocks you are!.
413 2018-10-29 20:43:31 I've a little money in stocks. For the longest time, Tesla was the most disappointing. Now Tesla is actually worth more than any of my other stocks and yet it's still worth a fair bit less than what I invested.
414 2018-10-29 20:43:00 @AldiUK is it just the #Eastbourne store that no longer stocks the chocolate peanuts and also chocolate raisins? They’ve been unavailable for weeks & they are husbands favourites #bringthemback
415 2018-10-29 20:42:17 - - - The Trump Administration's outrageous comment method has hijacked the news cycle yet again while Republican corruption runs wild, geopolitical disaster looms, stocks are crashing, institutionalized racism comes out of the shadows, the treasury is robbed etc.etc. - - -
416 2018-10-29 20:42:10 Stocks? The richest 10% of Americans own 84% of the stocks. They'll be fine.
417 2018-10-29 20:41:38 Stocks.
Flows.
Don’t confuse/compare.
418 2018-10-29 20:40:55 I had overweighted international stocks in my portfolio because I believed them to be more reasonably valued compared to the US... But when US goes down, everything else goes down even worse... So frustrating.
419 2018-10-29 20:40:39 How can they have money to invest in stocks or money to save when liberals want high taxes and low savings interest rates? The avg person has no money because it’s constantly being extracted by tax and savings are not incentivized.
420 2018-10-29 20:39:51 When talking about the Nasdaq Composite, remember that it's different from the Nasdaq of the 90s. It still has big tech but it also has stocks like Pepsi and Kraft Heinz,
421 2018-10-29 20:39:49 - - - The outrageous comment industry has hijacked the news cycle while Republican corruption runs wild, geopolitical disaster looms, stocks are crashing, institutionalized racism comes out of the shadows, the treasury is robbed, etc.etc. - - -
422 2018-10-29 20:39:19 hows your stocks?
423 2018-10-29 20:37:55 Thank you for kind words!  Love teaching about stocks & ETF's. REAL WORLD analysis and tactics.  Love ETF's cuz they avoid the drama you talk about. Love industry ETF's.  Give buys/sell on them also. Real-time. Not trading. Investing.
424 2018-10-29 20:37:28 I don't know man... Bears don't have that kinda power... They are just a bunch of guys who rage at high-mutiple stocks.
425 2018-10-29 20:36:57 I don’t understand why some people only trade certain priced stocks. Diversify yourself. Learn to go long and short. Small, mid, large caps... Makes it MUCH easier to find plays in any market condition. #stocks #daytrading $TSLA $NFLX $AMZN $SOLO
426 2018-10-29 20:36:08 And yet it has since the 30s and lifted many senior citizens out of poverty and the streets for decades. If it’s left alone by politicians that keep squandering to cover their greed, it will continue to do the same. The majority of Americans don’t have stocks or savings.
427 2018-10-29 20:35:31 Today’s wild swings in the market and BA 30 point drop is a sign that market is approaching a bottom. Why? Fear is rising as Bulls plunge, panic dumps in the untouchable stocks, VIX at 25, so much blood from momo chasers and traders.Fusion said more blood on way.. but LT bullish
428 2018-10-29 20:35:23 This sell-off isn't hard, guys. Just find good stocks and slowly put your money to work. Don't worry about timing or catching the bottom or other such nonsense.
429 2018-10-29 20:35:13 All FANGs are now in a bear market:

433 2018-10-29 20:34:08 Thinking it might be a good time to pull out our stocks but hubby is dragging his feet. Oh well, at least all our eggs aren’t in one basket. I’m hanging on, no matter what it takes to be here when this guy leaves office, but he’s aging me.

437 2018-10-29 20:33:35 Furthermore, police believe that the Vegas shooter had guns jam and bump stocks fail him, which actually helped lower the body count. The bump stock is a non-factor. There are plenty of ways to shoot faster with greater accuracy and reliability than a piece of plastic

439 2018-10-29 20:32:50 Dow down another 245 points today. Friday wiped out all gains for the year. Now we're in the red. You know who's been hit hard--stocks that are farm or steel related
440 2018-10-29 20:32:14 Offer valid while stocks last. 

441 2018-10-29 20:31:47 #policeinterceptors these tracksuit wearing scum bag yobbos should be put in stocks I'd pay a fiver to chuck a rotten tomato
442 2018-10-29 20:30:34 Interesting that as soon as the stocks go up, something bad is released. I smell desperation
443 2018-10-29 20:30:25 Like seryoso. Parang hindi ako nag back up parang yung isang opener din di nag back up. Sana kase laging may mid shift para di mo na problemahin yung linya pag nag prod ka. Para sila nalang yung magrerefill ng stocks diba. Di naman kaya na lahat sa opener nalang eh

445 2018-10-29 20:30:13 @realDonaldTrump if markets „made mistake” falling this weekend, are you buying stocks now? Can US President trade on the stock-market?
446 2018-10-29 20:30:05 2. So, part one is trading ideas. Time bound, short term, target oriented, limited to indices/stocks with active future contracts.
447 2018-10-29 20:29:43 I'm afraid you'll just have to access your savings and sell some stocks and shares like the rest of us.
448 2018-10-29 20:29:43 This is a normal correction that has occurred for decades. Buy now while the stocks are cheap!
449 2018-10-29 20:29:26 It's a gamble to bet and by the end of the day the stocks were down. TWTR was up but not much. I'd rather have it on the positive. The market has been tanking. I think there's a correction every ten years. So as with the housing market
450 2018-10-29 20:29:04 It might be time to split twitter up. 2 handles. Music and stocks. I try to keep it here so my musicians and rockers can see anyone can learn the market. Money in the bank is dead money. I had to be shown to see the light. I feel it is spamming your tl though.

452 2018-10-29 20:28:54 It may have made a difference. It likely made him a less accurate shooter. I didn’t know him, so I don’t know his ability and skill level, but my experience is bump stocks are unreliable and they lower accuracy
453 2018-10-29 20:28:08 So as long as Bobo stocks us with a ton of good talent we will be ok!

457 2018-10-29 20:27:13 My stocks dropped like 8% in 20 minutes. I hate economics.
458 2018-10-29 20:26:34 Even the pot stocks got crushed today. No highs (sorry/not sorry) for Aurora, Canopy, Tilray, Cronos and others. Double digit drops for $ACB $CGC $TLRY $CRON
459 2018-10-29 20:26:32 Ever notice when news reports come out that the Dems could possibly gain power in the federal government stocks plummet? Happened in ‘07-‘08 and now when its looking like Dems May take house.  If Reps keep majority’s watch for stocks to skyrocket. Going on history.
460 2018-10-29 20:26:27 World markets are crashing everywhere but yeah, of course, YOU were right about calling the "pot stocks bubble" and we should have listened to you LOL.
461 2018-10-29 20:26:22 But stocks is overpriced because it's a resale site
462 2018-10-29 20:26:08 Yes, but average investors will buy stocks because they are inflation hedge insofar as they are a claim on cash flows from real assets.
463 2018-10-29 20:25:54 I agree on macro data. Some think that’s starting to show some weakness. I think it’s fine so far. Yeah this correction was a long time coming, stocks aren’t supposed to go up forever. There should be ups and downs. First year in a long time though that stocks might finish down.
464 2018-10-29 20:24:46 No. I’m not a fan, personally, of bump stocks, but I don’t see where banning them is helpful. As for the remainder, no. We had a ten year ban on AR-Style weapons and there was no decrease in gun deaths other than the already in process decline.

466 2018-10-29 20:24:20 So what is your explanation for it holding a $100 price range for weeks while stocks crashed? The answer is that, you’re right. It’s a non-correlated asset. And with that, independent of traditional markets entirely. This is good AND bad. Don’t just be an eternal bear, it’s gross
467 2018-10-29 20:24:20 This...   not his

473 2018-10-29 20:22:35 I thought its well known O'Leary is a shitty investor?

Idk, so many metrics for the stocks out of place, if some black swan happens we easily still retrace 40% from here
474 2018-10-29 20:22:18 Everyday I look at my stocks it’s not about if I lost money. It’s about how much.
475 2018-10-29 20:22:13 This has escaped most market watchers, but the MSCI All-Country World Index made a significant top in early 2017, and has been moving sideways since, before breaking down #ausbiz #XJO #equities #investing #stocks

484 2018-10-29 20:19:49 Even the defense contractors stocks are heading down. The ETF with those in there was at +21% last week, today it's at +6%
485 2018-10-29 20:19:41 Stocks close sharply lower in the latest bout of volatility, putting S&P 500 on track for worst month since the financial crisis.
486 2018-10-29 20:19:40 My model says I should be short the S&P 500 now. I prefer to continue with a small long position in stocks but a whole lot more in T-bills and precious metals.

492 2018-10-29 20:18:28 And it was't. But there's no news, the stocks have been short selling after tremendous wins. It has a pattern of doing exactly this.  So I just need to learn when to sell. I am into Canopy and its entourage for the long term. But now rethinking that strategy.

494 2018-10-29 20:18:03 @realDonaldTrump You just lost the vote of anyone that owns a 401k, stocks or mutual funds. The average investor can't take "any" more. They're bowing out, but the Chinese, the Chinese are laughing at you. Just like the rest of the world is laughing at you.

498 2018-10-29 20:16:44 And “sticks and stones” is intended as a retort to insult. The notion that words cannot ‘hurt’ is nonsensical; words can end marriages, start wars, tank stocks, ruin careers, lead to millions of dollars in liability...and yes, result in death.

505 2018-10-29 20:14:32 I have my iMessage hidden simply because I don’t receive any messages from anyone  the only app I use is @RobinhoodApp for my stocks.
506 2018-10-29 20:14:12 take a note from old Rupert Murdoch-
turns the lead over to his kids-
sells a bunch of stocks-
the kids ain't doing so good-
buys the stocks back for a song-
the kids aren't who took the beating-
the jokers who thought they could by Fox did-
Rupert beat them again-
507 2018-10-29 20:14:00 That is amazing and in next crisis will they start buying stocks like what BoJ is doing?
508 2018-10-29 20:13:50 Johnny, not everyone can be the King of stocks
509 2018-10-29 20:13:48 Surprisingly, unlike on Friday, not all stocks participated in Monday's selloff!
510 2018-10-29 20:13:17 Stocks finish lower as Dow sheds more than 200 points
511 2018-10-29 20:13:16 The market punishes both longs and shorts. It just depends on whether you like your pain quick and severe or slow and steady! Hang in there both sides, much more volatility to come! #stocks
512 2018-10-29 20:13:02 #ThanksTrump. If he wants to take credit for the stocks when they are up, he gets blame when the market is down.
513 2018-10-29 20:12:00 @TheRealDonaIdTr stocks at a 52 week low. Fake drop? Media based drop? Or the response to a fake president?
514 2018-10-29 20:11:55 NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks close sharply lower in latest bout of volatility, putting S&P 500 on track for worst month since financial crisis.
515 2018-10-29 20:11:03 Crash the market and drop estimates to a point where they can be beaten on next ER and then create another surge of hope and influx of money when they do beat. Rise the stocks up to new highs. Crash it with other BS. RINSE. REPEAT. Thanks for comin out.
516 2018-10-29 20:10:52 Dear president. What about the stocks markets and savings of millions of people, not only in the US but across the globe, being immensely affected by all this volatility induced by your administration actions?
517 2018-10-29 20:10:40 GERMANY in ARAB WORLD IS REPRESENTED BY COUNTRY IRAN. They have a large percentage of stocks&bonds in United States, Albania, Greece, Crete, Monserrat, Germany properties, they had owned most of this area Im on/in as New York borough Queens & all of Saigon now
518 2018-10-29 20:10:35 NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks close sharply lower in latest bout of volatility, putting S&P 500 on track for worst month since financial crisis.
519 2018-10-29 20:10:32 With the latest selloff, there are no longer any #Marijuanastocks with valuations above $10B. Tilray, Canopy, Aurora all now well below. To me this is a good short term sign. Things were way too frothy. There will be some $20-30B stocks in a year or two, have to pick right ones.
520 2018-10-29 20:10:27 World stocks mixed: US -.7%; Europe +.9%. Today showed how easily investors can be manipulated, an early soaring market shot down by indications of more tariffs on China. Best advice: ignore the market for the rest of 2018 to avoid being lured into an action that will backfire.
521 2018-10-29 20:10:11 Gotta sell them crypto bags to meet tech stocks margin calls 
522 2018-10-29 20:09:58 This was at the same time TRUMPTARD opened his mouth and sent stocks right down the toilet 
523 2018-10-29 20:09:45 $SPY is more interesting at these levels #stocks
524 2018-10-29 20:09:05 I can see your point brother I really can. The reasons you state already back it up. However in stocks etc this is normal tbh. It’ll fly back up Xmas time 
525 2018-10-29 20:08:54 4:04 Eastern.  CNBC Headline:

STOCKS CLOSE OFF SESSION LOWS
526 2018-10-29 20:08:42 Hoy bakit ganun. Hindi naman ako nag off pero bakit nung naging opener ako nawalan na ng stocks. Tngina bakit 
527 2018-10-29 20:08:28 When stocks are rising:

The biggest risk is to the upside. A melt-up is a real possibility here

When stocks are falling:

The biggest risk is to the downside. A crash is a real possibility here

It's almost as if the direction of the markets drives the narrative in predictions
528 2018-10-29 20:08:18 Exactly. Correlations go to 1
I want to see separation of church and state (individual stocks versus the overall indexes)

530 2018-10-29 20:07:34 Stocks close sharply lower in latest bout of volatility, putting S&P 500 on track for worst month since financial crisis.
531 2018-10-29 20:07:15 Also no one cares about Canadian energy stocks either.
532 2018-10-29 20:07:02 Smart. I sold all of my pot stocks before legalization, which was smart. Then I bought back in 3 days later thinking that it would not keep going down. That was fucking stupid. Cash is King!
533 2018-10-29 20:06:24 I was told 401k is a company paid to invest your money. Know a few who lost theirs 401k all or almost all of it because they get paid every time they move it around or buy/sell. So it’s not about making you money but moving it. To do stocks think it takes some type of license.

535 2018-10-29 20:06:15 Keep trying to distract from what’s really going on! Magabomber, 11 dead in a temple and stocks plummeting! Yr rhetoric is destroying this country! Refugees are NOT the problem-YOU are!

538 2018-10-29 20:05:45 Interesting comment to make on a day when stocks and treasuries were down (though not saying you are wrong).
539 2018-10-29 20:05:23 Stocks are going to 0, crypto is going to Mars!

542 2018-10-29 20:05:08 Volatility now the new normal. Wall Street fizzles after early gains. The Dow is then down 2% 30 minutes before the close, to end up 1 percent lower at the closing bell. S&P 500 down 1.5%, Nasdaq ends down 2.8% after falls in tech and internet stocks @abcnews #auspol #ausbiz
543 2018-10-29 20:05:01 @ people with dropped trucks why do you ride around with stocks on the back and your 3 owner 24’s on the front?
544 2018-10-29 20:04:55 Hey how many $billions do you think Trump’s supporters are losing propping up his failed economy? 

stocks are tanking again(300 points today)  - even with the Corporate Tax scam stock buy back. 

The YTD market is negative & the deficit is a trillion dollars to tax payers
545 2018-10-29 20:04:53 Stock market October assault on Trump. MSM and Globalist stocks scaring uninformed people, building a nightmare scenario for mid-term elections. Greed will cause stock market to rebound after mid-terms.

548 2018-10-29 20:04:03  FAANG stocks ON SALE

551 2018-10-29 20:03:20 Global stocks down $8 trillion at market close today. I would be fine with an  1/8 injection into $BTC.
552 2018-10-29 20:03:10 Why is Soros and Democrats dumming there stocks right before election   we the people have it figured out. Been good till just recently. Go figure. Vote Red !;;!;
553 2018-10-29 20:03:07 ‘Analyst who predicted the _____ tells us what’s next for stocks’
554 2018-10-29 20:02:48 @paulypilot is correct. Mkt is changing. It is a discounting mechanism. Stocks can go down on good trading statements if expensive & vica versa. Too many forgotten. 5-8 year multiple expansion made all complacent. Too many say buy as derated a little but can derate a lot more
555 2018-10-29 20:02:42 People look a terrible stocks and say "who cares I'm not invested" but they neglect to realize their job ultimately comes from one of those investors losing money  in stocks. So when they lose money they stop funding and businesses close.
556 2018-10-29 20:02:36 How are weed stocks doing? ;-) #munchies
557 2018-10-29 20:02:27 Only crypto is a buy right now, not stocks
558 2018-10-29 20:02:27 :: Another day to NOT check your retirement savings plan...

Stocks sink again, erasing 500 points from the Dow and bringing the S&P 500 index 10 percent below its September peak.
559 2018-10-29 20:02:26 I agree with you. I don't think there was any growth at all net of government debt during the past 10 years and that fact is now regurgitated in rapid fashion in the stock market. Irrespective of the PPT (if it exists) these stocks aren't worth that much and therefore they fall.
560 2018-10-29 20:02:24 No, other stocks go up and down, baba is just going down for weeks now ! Crazy, shorting it seems guranteed win :)
561 2018-10-29 20:02:21 nope no beer stocks for now sentiment is Cannabis will kill them  and aluminum tarifs = higher raw material costs ..
562 2018-10-29 20:02:02 I am not a fan of any gold stocks.  $GLD
563 2018-10-29 20:01:59 Pretending to like femdom because you know I like it, making me interested, and then saying, "I'm really more of a sub tbh" should earn you a day in the stocks.
564 2018-10-29 20:01:59 Feels like we're at one of those occasional market points in treasuries where if stocks go up, it probably means bonds aren't selling off much, and if stocks go down from here, treasuries really rally
565 2018-10-29 20:01:52 Markets are driven by fear and greed also. If Trump tweets the truth that we're in the biggest bubble the world has ever seen you see a cascading selloff in stocks and bonds. Wouldn't you sell?
566 2018-10-29 20:01:34 I would choose

"And that is--...not it!"

Commentators love declaring stocks when players haven't actually died yet.

See ya in my McScrooge vault
567 2018-10-29 20:01:19 Have you indexed it ? Stocks are worth a lot more than 10 years ago so absolute comparisons don’t make sense
568 2018-10-29 20:01:11 tick-tock... Stocks fell as you tweeted 
569 2018-10-29 20:00:59 I had a Bad feeling about 911 and the Stock market..I thought after looking and watching all the Facts..That it was an inside job re:Stocks
570 2018-10-29 20:00:32 To minimize risk I diversified U holdings by country and by the part of the business (producer/miner/junior explorer etc) So have some Namibia stocks, Some Canadian, Some Australian and some US. It is going to be a lucrative ride up WT.
571 2018-10-29 20:00:24 JUST THE FACTS: According to a Transamerica Retirement Study, more Millennials have their retirement plans invested in cash and bonds than those that have all of it invested in stocks.
572 2018-10-29 20:00:23 the only issue with buying shorter term call options in this high vix is that when the vix pulls back on the stocks bouncing, the IV drains out and sucks all the profits out of your bounce gains
573 2018-10-29 20:00:14 #BREAKING via @AP: Stocks sink again, erasing 500 points from the Dow.
574 2018-10-29 19:59:39 My 401k lost money this year...thanks Trump...ofcoarse we won't here him talk about losses as he only takes responsibility when stocks go up
575 2018-10-29 19:59:27 Indeed! I have ben long since 1.4 cad and will be staying long untill 50 dollar's were i might sell half my stocks. Yet it would be intresting to now what @Sqwii think will happen short term so i can time it right wen i buy more 
576 2018-10-29 19:59:18 Wasn't tariffs in 2008 that sank the market, was housing, wasn't housing that sank the market in 2000, was the dotcom bust, wasn't internet stocks that sank it in 2001, it was 9/11, so what is it in 2018? It's down because it was up which might always be the real reason. #Crash
577 2018-10-29 19:59:16 So why are stocks falling when the US economy is growing at above normal rate? Is this "growth" real?
578 2018-10-29 19:59:10 Bought some nasdaq stocks into this wave of panic..
579 2018-10-29 19:58:41 Look at stocks like $KIND_SDB 

Imagine your 3 cent $UKG to be worth 100$
580 2018-10-29 19:58:18 i really couldn't fucking say, mi timeline is crazy, I think there was lots of stocks (specially tech) and we're going through a correction, but I really can't say. $NFLX is a bloodbath for instance

582 2018-10-29 19:58:05 AP: Stocks are falling sharply in late afternoon trading on Wall Street, putting the market on track for its worst month since the Financial Crisis.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 500 points Monday, pulled down by big losses in Boeing and Apple.
583 2018-10-29 19:58:02 It is one of the things that baffles me a little.  Bottoms up there are way more cheap stocks than in February. If stocks keep falling as they have in last month by year's end 2010-2012 bargains will be available. The indices do not seem to reflect this. Not even close.
584 2018-10-29 19:57:58 Can someone explain why pot stocks are tanking? Can’t even meet demmand in Quebec. Already don’t understand stock market that well but this makes no sense. Asking for a friend. Especially if border security is reading this.
585 2018-10-29 19:57:50 BREAKING from @AP: Stocks sink again, erasing 500 points from the Dow.

587 2018-10-29 19:57:47 White Eurodollars all up while S & P hits new lows so TED spread ok. At this stage no financial plumbing issues causing this sell off. #stocks #interestrates
588 2018-10-29 19:57:44 Its called a correction on average they happen every 354 days and last 14 weeks. They are a great time to pick up big name stocks at a discount especially for those in for the long haul. Fear of Democrat congress has been the main sell note, thses other events are low factors.
589 2018-10-29 19:57:43 I took 90% of my retirement funds out of stocks back in around February 2017, figuring Trump’s idiocy was surely leading someplace bad. Hasn’t worked out so well, overall. But I still feel like Trump is an ever-present catastrophic risk.
590 2018-10-29 19:57:36 Lol naw see I’ll invest 5 bandz in stocks gamble 20k lol and spend about 20k on bills have 5k for weed ya dig and put 50 bandz in my savings trust me if somebody gave me a mill I promise to god I’ll real life kill shit life planned out

597 2018-10-29 19:56:38 Still waiting for the Toddler in Chief to take the blame for this as he was so eager to take the credit when stocks went up. Wondering why he is so silent on the issue. @realDonaldTrump we're waiting for your apology on this. Come on, be a man for once in your life.

NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks sink again, erasing 500 points from the Dow and bringing the S&P 500 index 10 percent below its September peak.
633 2018-10-29 19:48:38 Cryptos correlation with US stocks is not good news
634 2018-10-29 19:48:35 All countries have violent, hateful people, but only in America do we give them ready access to assault weapons, large-capacity magazines and even bump stocks, and that’s in part because of the N.R.A. 
Blackburn will do absolutely nothing to end this violence.
635 2018-10-29 19:48:32 Does anyone else just go on whatever stocks app they use and refresh every 10 seconds watching their money fluctuate? Like woo just made $30, ope back to $10, oh wait back up now to $45. Let’s get this bread!!!
636 2018-10-29 19:48:29 odd correlation with outflows from $BTC & $LTC matching outflows from equities & #biotech - usually they are more inversely correlated, with money flowing out of #stocks and into safe haven asset stores such as #gold & #cryptocurrency.

641 2018-10-29 19:48:02 When can stocks go up again?
642 2018-10-29 19:48:00 don't care how it came about.. GDP bounced and gave a positive number.. so buy stocks.

644 2018-10-29 19:47:54 Markets plunge in late afternoon trading after posting solid gains. Dow Industrials down more than 500 points, TSX off about 250 just before close. Market weighed down by ongoing slump in tech stocks, and investor unease over possibility of trade war. rate hikes.
645 2018-10-29 19:47:37 Phew I pulled my money out of stocks on time

647 2018-10-29 19:47:10 I don't own any stocks, and I don't believe they're the chief barometer of an economy's success, and I could give a shit when the stock market re-opened after 9/11 ("Save us, NYSE!"). But holy hell, the #DowJones is down 2,674 points since Oct. 2.
648 2018-10-29 19:46:51 wtf is happening to tech stocks?
649 2018-10-29 19:46:22  News that pushed markets sharply down:

Bloomberg News reported that the U.S. is planning on slapping tariffs on more Chinese products if upcoming talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping falter.

650 2018-10-29 19:46:04 Well, the sell off in stocks is not surprising but the complacency in talking heads on Wall Street is. The economy may be facing more head winds even with employment high. It doesn't imply real progress. Debt has fueled growth and that is about to come to a halt
651 2018-10-29 19:45:53 Stocks are getting slaughtered
652 2018-10-29 19:45:53 Nah, we investing in Bosco Stick stocks
653 2018-10-29 19:45:30 The drop in tech stocks was almost inevitable, but the particular battering of $NVDA is just peculiar
654 2018-10-29 19:43:58 Another "fine" day on Wall Street as tech stocks lead indices lower. If you bought Amazon on October 1, you paid $2,000/share. Today, $1,501. #Ouch

660 2018-10-29 19:43:01 Low of the day - another bloodbath in US stocks. Carnage! Dead cat bounce at the open taking its cue from a strong European market.

662 2018-10-29 19:42:42 Gold reminds me of 2003-2005 timeframe - anyone buying it, or miners, was a weirdo.  Everyone was downgrading gold and stocks.  $GLD $SLV $AUY $ABX $CDE $GG $JNUG $DUST
663 2018-10-29 19:42:36 look at all that algo liquidity in stocks
664 2018-10-29 19:42:04 Don't freak out over the stock market. This is all because of big Tech stocks which are tremendously overvalued. Amazing how a few large companies can drive the market
665 2018-10-29 19:41:33 FANG stocks trading like phase II biotech stocks

670 2018-10-29 19:40:38 It wouldn’t surprise me, but I thought you’d have to have special training or something for that?  Isn’t it like stocks bonds, savings, that kind of thing?

672 2018-10-29 19:40:21 Any one else find it curious that the market is down daily as we get closer to the Mid-terms? Could it be the liberal billionaires selling off stocks?
673 2018-10-29 19:40:08 When defensive stocks like $TLRY and $CGC are down more than 15%, its time for @federalreserve to step in and be a buyer of last resort.

683 2018-10-29 19:37:42 The green was short lived.  Key stocks are red now
684 2018-10-29 19:37:37 I’ll be doing my performance art piece “Do You Still Love Me?” starting at 9:30am in front of the NYSE. For all stocks in correction territory I’ll be screaming:

685 2018-10-29 19:37:29 No, 2014 documents revealed the $120K per year figure. And the $32B in stocks alone makes the #Mormon church possibly the most wealthy on earth. Look at Mormon Leaks for both figures. Grant Palmer reported the $1M signing bonus.

689 2018-10-29 19:35:28 Stocks are sliding, wages are flat and interest rates are zooming. Tariffs took a big bite out of the economy and DEFICITS soared 1 TRILLION dollars. You better get your eyes checked
690 2018-10-29 19:35:20 We lost all of our investment, savings and retirement $ in the 2008 real estate crash. We will never be able to retire.  We’ll probably never own stocks again either.
691 2018-10-29 19:35:19 Bump stocks are still legal man. Jesus.
692 2018-10-29 19:34:28 NASDAQ touching -13% this month to date. Every bull was overweight NASDAQ coming into October. Every one. This needs to be a part of every closing argument in the close Senate races. If stocks are a proxy for the US economy - it’s no longer a strong economy. Full stop.
693 2018-10-29 19:34:09 I like asking my normie friends what they think certain stocks and what bitcoin is going to do. I always 100% countertrade them and its worked out 100% of the time lmao Best indicators yet.
694 2018-10-29 19:33:41 There are already universal background checks, bump stocks are too basic to effectively ban, no one is against gun violence research--it just shouldn't be done by CDC (try ATF), safe storage just means you get to scapegoat robbery victims afterward
695 2018-10-29 19:33:07 I stress, do not argue with your stocks and your stops.   #stocks
696 2018-10-29 19:33:03 I hear you, but for a 20+ year outlook, stocks are the best bet in my novice opinion. But again I still incorporate options in my portfolio to generate cash or sell puts into pullbacks instead of buying more stock.
697 2018-10-29 19:33:00 one can literally hire you as a spiderman photographer for stocks to be uesd in headers lmao. Dm me some of these screenshots you take 
698 2018-10-29 19:31:54 When stocks go down, don't panic. If you panic, you are playing their game. Stick to your own plan #stocks
699 2018-10-29 19:31:32 Just amazed me it took this long after all those breaches - this more than any other stock told us how broken the market was IMO - that and those Bitcoin stocks ….
700 2018-10-29 19:31:24 Watch for stocks not making new lows as the major indices do.  Could be a tell for upcoming days for a bottom in the major indices.

702 2018-10-29 19:29:44 I also stay away from dividend stocks since the options have less premium in them.  For me it is all about cost basis reduction to improve probability of profit.  That being said the Beta Weighted Deltas need to be respected as well.  Don’t want them too high or low
703 2018-10-29 19:29:22 No Comment. Consider NOT watching TV, unless, HDMI connected?

710 2018-10-29 19:27:21 And if you want a lesson in insane IPO valuations take a look at $CURA.CN in the pot #stocks space. How the heck did they place $400M at a $4B valuation? Well it’s already under $3B on its first day trading. It’s the Wild West in this sector folks. #marijauna
711 2018-10-29 19:27:07 Hard to buy. Even harder to short because so many stocks are low and risk for rally not worth it. Maybe gap down Tom and buy

713 2018-10-29 19:26:57 My stocks are dying. I’m dying.
714 2018-10-29 19:26:37 Funfact: When news articles mention stocks for a company rising or falling...

They do that anyways, and when news outlets use that angle, they usually only look at general stocks, not... all the others. 25% of general stocks, could just translate to 5% of all stocks.
715 2018-10-29 19:26:34 Stocks continue to drop like a bowling ball in water with the bottom nowhere in sight.
716 2018-10-29 19:26:21 You save $ by hanging on to your stocks to the bottom, where ever that may be! Don't worry be happy- Trump is in charge. it's all the FED's fault!
717 2018-10-29 19:26:18 That's the problem I see--It's not difficult to modify them for auto-fire. (Bump stocks are the easy solution.) Also, they can accommodate 30-round magazines. Legal or not, they're out there. I had one forgotten in a footlocker years after I left the Army.
718 2018-10-29 19:26:16 yen last night was analog for stocks today
719 2018-10-29 19:26:09 The most surprising event of October isn't that stocks are having one of their worst months since the financial crisis, it's that the yield on the ten year is up for the month while it's happening.
720 2018-10-29 19:25:46 $SPY 165 puts now 2.10 from .85 , position closed 4 now - Stocks making 52 week highs are: $NTWK $SMP $YANG $NEO $EEV $ESSS $YXI $TSCO

723 2018-10-29 19:25:05 stocks down, spirits up
724 2018-10-29 19:24:48 October is historically a bad month for stocks. In my opinion this is a healthy correction. Not an economist, a trader! Keeping it simple!
725 2018-10-29 19:24:43 Meanwhile, as Sarah Sanders lies
stocks turn lower amid worries about Trump's trade war
Let's just concede something in the interest of being bipartisanship
Trump does have a certain genius
.., at destroying everything he's ever touched
the economy, decency, the USA, everything
726 2018-10-29 19:24:15 Bull markets are driven by net money flows into stocks over time, bear markets are driven by net money flows out of stocks over time. So the assumption that money is always and at all times trying to come into stocks is not always correct...
727 2018-10-29 19:24:01 The #VIX is so clearly telling you that people / institutions are just selling stocks and indexes NOT protecting w options which is obviously bad. $SPY #ES #Selloff
728 2018-10-29 19:23:42 So if stocks actually do #Crash, cause the @federalreserve has messed up yet again, and the Federal Reserve responds by injecting "liquidity" will it kick off a hyper inflation? Will we see #bitcoin explode higher as people come to realize stocks will not do well.
729 2018-10-29 19:23:27 @todd_harrison is a smart guy ---- but he's terribly mis-informed on maryjane stocks ---- or he owns them much higher and needs to unload  them to you ---ultimately  he is not to be trusted on this trade

733 2018-10-29 19:21:55 I think owning div growing stocks over the long term is a real wealth builder. Short puts are good for pullbacks to generate cash flow in a portfolio. I don’t think a portfolio w/ 100% option allocation is sustainable. True diversity is a combo of all products distributed equally

736 2018-10-29 19:21:18 I was pretty bummed at the time, because I had bought some Red Hat shares as my very first foray into tech stocks in 2006, at $24 (and then bought more at $16).

743 2018-10-29 19:18:45 The $SPY has made a lower high for 9 days in a row now.  We would need that pattern to change before we could even entertain the idea of a short term bottom.  Trying to buy stocks in this environment is a futile endeavor since momentum is still clearly building to the downside.

746 2018-10-29 19:18:31 The equity market is starting to really shake the most confident bulls now. Today the major market indices opened well > +1%, but has drifted down since. Now it’s headed toward another materially down close. Worst month for stocks since Nov 2008.

Party’s over.
747 2018-10-29 19:18:29 Yeah it is a crazy cycle yet again. I have big hopes like everyone but seem immune to feeling the stress. Stocks is like a board game for me and the money never seems real. Not sure why its like that for me.
748 2018-10-29 19:18:05 Ummm #kiwibuild was never about state housing. $650k in Auckland is entry level. They are also returning state housing stocks after National sold them off. This is  a ridiculous manufactured stoush.

764 2018-10-29 19:13:56 So what was gearing up to be a nice week in the market, thanks to the WH, we now will most probably have a negative open tomorrow, & another crappy week. I feel so bad for holders of Chinese related stocks. I hope you bought protection. There is no reason to catch a falling knife
765 2018-10-29 19:13:42 I think I overdosed on BTS, even my egg stocks hurst. I am bedridden. HELP.
766 2018-10-29 19:13:41 apple stocks rise by 35%.
767 2018-10-29 19:12:43 Of course stocks will rebound they always do.  Did they happen to mention when this might happen.  Tomorrow...5 years from now.  That's the hard part.
768 2018-10-29 19:12:38 Here is the irony: if the soybean story becomes more bearish (end stocks forecast over 1 B and SH near 8.00) then usda may feel compelled to offer more $$ (maybe hinted at usda outlook by Perdue?). Then farmers will be incented to plant more soybeans, adding more bearish fodder

772 2018-10-29 19:11:32 Pot stocks down almost 9% today.  Down 35% from mid-September as a group.
773 2018-10-29 19:10:00 Amazon stocks en $1540. En setiembre las veiamos por encima de los $2,000. Estoy que me tiro de un puente...

776 2018-10-29 19:09:24 Stop acting Cramer he is clueless about this sector. Marijuana stocks won't find their bottoms until end of November. Treat them like penny stocks

780 2018-10-29 19:08:57 Pot stocks getting smoked yet again
OUCH!
Still feels like Bitcoin and Dotcom 
Rinse and repeat
781 2018-10-29 19:08:37 just so we're clear, the only reason stocks are going down is because of the fed acting crazy, no other crazy people in the room?
782 2018-10-29 19:08:35 Man those weed stocks sure did take a fucking nose dive  smoke em if you got em stoners... trying to make money.
783 2018-10-29 19:08:35 President....Ease up on the tariffs you’re killing my stocks !!thanks
784 2018-10-29 19:08:30 DJIA was up 300 earlier today. Now down 250. Many stocks in correction territory. Haven’t heard Trump talking about the market recently. I’m sure he thinks it’s the Fed’s fault.
785 2018-10-29 19:08:28 YOU ALL just still dont get it. Entire October from hell is ALL due to what the S&P did at the end of Sept. They basically tied EVERYTHING to the 3 most OVERVALUED stocks in the world. $amzn $nglx $googl.

THEY TANK THE ENTIRE MARKET TANKS,

786 2018-10-29 19:07:39 Chinese stocks are at crazy levels 

Check out WYNN already below 100 about 50% down
787 2018-10-29 19:07:31 Absolutely! You are correct. RSI showed failed upside buy targets. One of the best sell signals are failed buy signals. Last December. Short stock indices, widely followed stocks and BitCoin Suggested most of my clients and course students get out last December
788 2018-10-29 19:07:24 (((( : )))) *stocks up on coffee* me t....too
789 2018-10-29 19:07:01 STOCK MARKET DECLINE a bleep or permanent?  Farmers & many companies like Ford  have already been hurt by trump's trade wars & stupid economic polices.  Foreigners are looking to do business with companies not based in USA.  Thanks trump. No wonder insiders are selling stocks
790 2018-10-29 19:05:55 Pharma sector stocks are very less.. any reason ?
791 2018-10-29 19:05:40 that's defensive stocks ...like  $PM $MO $PEP
792 2018-10-29 19:05:34 Trump why haven’t you banned bump stocks and raised the age to purchase a firearm to 21 like you said you were going to do? Are you afraid of the NRA? #FailForceOne
793 2018-10-29 19:05:17 Year to date from the Erlanger Chart Room universe of 4600 stocks 36% are higher, down from 55% in September and in the last two weeks 49% and then 41% (weeks ended 10/15 and 10/22). Ouch! $IWM $SPY
794 2018-10-29 19:05:13 Thing is - stocks and "classic" risk off xxxJPY are a bit asynchronous at the moment.
795 2018-10-29 19:04:57 I remain bullish in #stocks overall as sentiment has become very nervous. We will see how this plays out but with bond yields in the low 3’s, I believe market is oversold.
796 2018-10-29 19:04:47 $esea ,  $tops  , $glbs  for instance theyre shipping sector stocks

803 2018-10-29 19:03:22 Can we all stop dumping @nvidia stocks? Are people not understanding the potential of this HW on automotive, finance and autonomous mobility?
804 2018-10-29 19:02:59 As for #marijuana #stocks this sector has been so hot, and has looked similar to crypto a few years back. It may not play out identically but time will tell. Stocks in this sector have already pulled back 30-50% in a month! Only a handful will win so good luck picking the winners

809 2018-10-29 19:01:43 We were wrong calling for a late cycle rally in Canadian stocks earlier in the year. #TradeWar impact on Asia was likely a big factor which our indicators did not pick up. Structural Cdn oil & gas issues also a missed factor (including #TransMountain pipeline fiasco).
810 2018-10-29 19:01:36 95% herring quotas in Eng waters sold on to a Dutch company with English reg'd vessel. As long as quotas are treated as commodities to be sold on then the same will happen in Scotland.

Lost the cod war with iceland then demanded huge quotas from the EU that decimated NE stocks.

814 2018-10-29 19:00:59 Bump stocks mean nothing. You can make your own . A new law would only inconvenience someone oh about ten seconds
815 2018-10-29 19:00:16 Meaningful declines, end with a BANG or a WHIMPER. 

Bang would be a vicious waterfall decline where the public throws their stocks out the window creating a big bang waterfall.

Whimper would be where stocks are sold out, lower volume & act trendless around a bottom.
816 2018-10-29 19:00:00 I take it that construction—which can shed 100k jobs/month for years on end—will not retrench, despite the big sell-off in their stocks.

822 2018-10-29 18:57:31 Perfect credit, more stocks, and to minimize my student loans.
823 2018-10-29 18:57:23 The KRE regional banking index is unusually depressed, and the underlying bank stocks aren't declining in response to any obvious diminution in earnings or business outlook. To me, that might potentially spell an interesting opportunity, purely from a theoretical perspective.
824 2018-10-29 18:57:07 Growth names getting ammed again. There are some good #stocks getting thrown out with the rest. But this has been surprisingly ugly today I have to admit. On the #marijuana stock front, looks like the anticipated correction is in full blown crash mode now
825 2018-10-29 18:56:08 After careful consideration, I have reached the conclusion that dumping all my longs this morning and going apeshit shorting stocks was a good move.
826 2018-10-29 18:56:02 STOCKS...Foreigners Surprise for Trump & Republicans?  While foreign investors have cut back on their purchases of USA stocks & bonds, they still haven't dumped their prior holdings exceeding $5 Trillion.  SCARY how that would tank USA economy and market like nothing seen before

828 2018-10-29 18:55:16 Tech is pretty much the only thing that the average joe gets really excited about and that’s what gets overpriced very quickly. The same joes is the reason consistent sell-offs happen as stocks race to the bottom because they didn’t know what they were doing in the first place.
829 2018-10-29 18:55:13 wow what a trap ..thinking US stocks will be sold down till after election day
830 2018-10-29 18:54:25 @KellyannePolls Maybe @realDonaldTrump should think about stronger gun laws (far more than banning bump stocks) instead of asking us to “heal and come together as a nation” as if that canned speech garbage will help stem the blood bath that America is.

834 2018-10-29 18:52:33 These corrections suck and are painful but these are emotions that prevent rational investing.  Look at the companies you really like and their valuations.  The market likes lower PE stocks like Disney and Verizon right now. $DIS $VZ
835 2018-10-29 18:51:34 The ranges today in the index futures.

838 2018-10-29 18:51:12 The market's are like a swimming pool. You can jump in. But you better know how to swim and how to get out. #stocks
839 2018-10-29 18:50:38 You can make a bump stock with a rubber band or hook your thumb through a belt loop. Bump stocks make it so difficult to hit your target the Las Vegas shooter could have killed more without one.
840 2018-10-29 18:50:32 $AMZN is down 6% so I don't feel bad about my boujie ass stocks being down more than that

848 2018-10-29 18:48:26 Yes - but $TSLA fading a bit -  hard to fight the bearish $NDX and stock market tsunami.  Stocks way oversold, but end of month and extended stock market sell off has a life of its own. #BeCareful

850 2018-10-29 18:48:19 Stocks rose on the news of this economically stimulative pricing...
851 2018-10-29 18:48:17 MPs should be put in the stocks for an hour every Friday, at noon, and citizens charged £1 per tomato, with the money going towards the NHS.

853 2018-10-29 18:47:46 All we need now is for the stock market to crash. That will have an impact from which those lucky enough to own stocks can recover, & it may strip away Trump’s support from all those in the top 20% who think he is great for this economy.
854 2018-10-29 18:47:45 $ENSV ive seen stocks dump on good news then rocket few days later.prob wont happen here with our luck but it might. Insiders should buy now

856 2018-10-29 18:46:58 Doesn't this mean stocks should be going up?
857 2018-10-29 18:46:47 ratio of NYSE stocks with sell imbalances vs buy imbalances marked for #MOC is currently 4:1

863 2018-10-29 18:45:06 Thankfully the illiquid dark OTC stocks I focus on are very disconnected from the wider market movements. It's also a lot easier to hold your nerve when you're buying in well below liquidation value.
864 2018-10-29 18:44:57 Stocks vs flows..
865 2018-10-29 18:44:29 $DCIX $PXS $GLBS $TOPS $SINO. Mark this date and price for each of these stocks. One of them will run over 500% this week or next week!
866 2018-10-29 18:43:54 Another great day! DJIA was +355, now -100 & counting.  

Stocks finally moderately oversold in short term.  A 1-3 week rally should start today or tomorrow. $TNA a good spec for 10% or so gain over course of rally.  

Intermediate & longer-term stocks'll go far, far lower. $SPY
867 2018-10-29 18:43:42 Not a good day for buy the dippers, buy the dippers, buy the dippers... on the pot stocks... buying over the past two weeks on the way down... $CGC $TLRY $CRON $PYX

869 2018-10-29 18:42:29 What's happening during my lunch? Stocks continue to slide as Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P are all in decline. British pound continues to lose ground against the dollar, currently 1.28-1.00.

872 2018-10-29 18:41:41 If  needed I will speculate to the down side with options are naked short other stocks. I have given 3 of my favorite short ideas a while ago; not short anything right now.
873 2018-10-29 18:41:29 I used to gamble on which stocks would go up or down and I lost and made a lot of money doing that, now I’m gonna play index’s because my move today is already up 150%.  Bear market baby.
874 2018-10-29 18:41:27 The market today: 1) Wow this $RHT deal is great for tech stocks ! 2) Oh wait... no ... maybe $IBM just made a huge mistake!! @LaMonicaBuzz
875 2018-10-29 18:41:02 $PXS $TOPS $DCIX - I went w dcix today. Holding 100%. These are a few stocks that are actually acting well. Ugly action in most of market

877 2018-10-29 18:39:22 There's absolutely nothing bullish about $USDJPY these days. Nothing remotely bullish about #stocks or #bitcoin either. The trend is your friend, right?

878 2018-10-29 18:39:08 $HEAR has been extremely volatile for a stock. Turtle Beach headphones was at $0.50 cents a share last year this time and hit an all time high of over $30.00 a share this year. Money to be made everywhere.

883 2018-10-29 18:37:54 Technical analysis is ONE of FOUR primary metrics (fundamentals, structural, psychology are the others).  If TA were the ONLY metric, stocks would be 'better' higher and 'worse' lower, which is an inherently flawed approach.

887 2018-10-29 18:34:04 Pot stocks are getting killed now so time to buy
888 2018-10-29 18:33:42 $CHAM 01 if they come back to life it would be really good.  At one point post RS 100% held by insiders.  meaning float was prob 001% to put that in last filing....  Their other stocks are a lot higher I believe with one of them rebounding very high at one point.
889 2018-10-29 18:33:32 Pot stocks are a different story majority ran up huge on speculation/momo and big money shorted heavily. When real companies making billions in profits are on a down slide POT stocks are getting slaughtered accordingly

A good batsman knows when to strike the ball by timing it well, similarly a good investor with the power of ICICIdirect knows when is the right time to invest in the right stocks. So it's important to be patient while investing in the  right stocks.

898 2018-10-29 18:30:46 ok i was wrong, apparently eToro is something different than an exchange. i don't know shit about anything other than crypto trading on exchanges, never bought stocks or bonds or whatever 
899 2018-10-29 18:30:32 Untold story about October is that institutions have been unloading positions big time many stocks blew through major support like it was nothing. Market will move when they start buying.
900 2018-10-29 18:30:30 Indeed, I was just reading about the January effect in Richard L. Evans' 'Finding Winners among depressed and low-priced stocks'.The data shows one should buy after halloween and that the majority of the gains come in January. Great book btw.
901 2018-10-29 18:30:28 So you are endorsing low level crime and believe we should accept it? So a free house paid for by taxpayers, many who can't even get a mortgage and are trapped in a rental nightmare, is the solution to our problems? Public lashings could be classified as treatment. Stocks? #cheap

903 2018-10-29 18:30:12 from these stocks $AAPL $NFLX $GOOG $AMZN $FB
$NFLX is the only one that  beat quarterly earnings by 30% 2 weeks ago ER

and is the only one  that is at 30%  discount from ER!

905 2018-10-29 18:29:22 Stocks verdict from #Budget2018 - good news for bookies, bit of a disappointment for retailers. Housebuilders knew Help to Buy had to come to an end, but soothed by a two-year extension. Very little for banks and insurers.
906 2018-10-29 18:29:03 Indeed.  When I looked at the stocks in HMMJ, the top few accounted for ~70% of the aggregate market cap; had ~$200 million of trailing year revenue; and ~$400M of operating LOSSES.
907 2018-10-29 18:28:57 The #NRA needs to use their blood money to buy a soul and ban bump stocks. 

Instead they bill the AR-15 as "America's Rifle" and throw millions into politics to "protect" the 2nd Amendment.

What an insidious group.

Sienna: Things not good for Cole. His TCU football team was beat. Stocks shaken up and thing didn't get threw. Well, this week well be a good one. This sweet babydoll use her curves to settle down.
909 2018-10-29 18:27:53 Key word here is speculative, there is a much higher chance that the stock market will be around in 10 yrs vs bitcoin. Stocks represent everything (multiple layers of economy) while bitcoin represents  what exactly - decentralization. A si gel idea vs millions of ideas

911 2018-10-29 18:27:11 Is primary market dependent on secondary market? Issued securities are traded in secondary market offering liquidity to stocks at a price. New issue market provides direct link between prospective investors & co...health of primary market depends on secondary market & vice versa.
912 2018-10-29 18:27:03 BIG PHARMA & Health Insurance! Profits & stocks continue to rise!! However,doctors are shutting down their offices & Hospitals are closing due to decrease in payment/reimbursement. Working America cannot afford Health Insurance or healthcare. Does this seem right? SYSTEM BROKEN!
913 2018-10-29 18:26:34 At least when buybacks start again companies won’t be buying their stocks at all time highs
914 2018-10-29 18:25:58 Alot OTC stocks are garbage and can take your money in a blink of an eye, if you want a safer bet take a look at $TREP ..... $AMRN $RDGL $BIOAQ $FUSZ $GRDO $RSHN $VRUS $EOMN $CELZ $SIAF $DIGAF $BIEL $LQMT $MAXD $HIPH $UOIP $POTN $LVVV $PURA $HPIL $MSPC $PLSB $ANDI $FRLF $DMAN
915 2018-10-29 18:25:30 This Congress has done nothing to protect us from gun violence. 

Gun owners and non gun owners have asked Congress to:
-ban bump stocks
-ban silencers 
-enact red flag laws 
-ensure mental health services

This Congress and @RepStefanik have been ineffective. #NY21

920 2018-10-29 18:23:37 Wwe stocks are going down the drain.
921 2018-10-29 18:23:02 It’s a great way to learn how to invest with minimal risk. Just remember to only risk what you can afford to lose and do your own DD on any stocks you’re interested in.

924 2018-10-29 18:19:42 @MelissaLeeCNBC not watching CNBC but from the reaction of $djia CNBC must be spreading more FEAR. Can’t find undervalued stocks? Lots but the your game plan is to trash the market so friends pick up stocks cheap, which is disgraceful conduct.
925 2018-10-29 18:19:32 What is a #BullTrap - false signal indicating that a declining stock or currency has reversed & is heading back up again when the instrument was only retracing to again trend lower. #StockMarket #Timing #Stocks #PatienceTrader $DIA $SPY $QQQ #DontBuyTheCoverRally #SwingTrading
926 2018-10-29 18:18:59 yes... but most of these stocks had a fantastic run upward as well...! eg, Tencent hit <150 on the Brexit result day n then went all the way up to 470+...
927 2018-10-29 18:18:20 Let’s see these Chinese stocks go up as the master level was hit. It’s tough being patient and waiting so long.
928 2018-10-29 18:18:19 Aaand stocks are in the red again.

933 2018-10-29 18:16:19 Difficult to identify an overall s/t  floor for the #SP500 as market is getting very sector specific, as it rotates away from #FANG growth stocks into banks and other beaten down sectors
934 2018-10-29 18:16:07 Exactly, but then again look at bitcoin. They access your computer to mine bitcoin, who knows what else it could be doing. Cryptocurrency is definitely something I’m out of touch with in the finance world. Far prefer bonds and stocks and less risky investments 
935 2018-10-29 18:16:01 pls reply with all kinds of reaction memes, my stocks are running low
936 2018-10-29 18:16:00 "God, that'd be hot... I could really pull out the stocks with a wig and makeup." Bryan joked, chuckling. "Hmm? Yeah, kinda. Something about it really appeals to me. Obviously not the real stuff, but it's fun when it's imaginary."

938 2018-10-29 18:15:44 Bet on these stocks back in 2012. Lost 90% to date. I wouldn’t touch them.
939 2018-10-29 18:15:23 Of course, kick 'em while they're down. And it doesn't help that it's mostly retail holding these stocks, It will change soon
940 2018-10-29 18:15:00 The gun problems have been going on for decades. Why does congress fail to solve the problem? At least President Trump has stopped the sale of bump stocks. Should you be voted out of office?
941 2018-10-29 18:14:42 You mean you don’t keep emergency stocks in your fridge at all times? Just me then.

951 2018-10-29 18:10:04 You invested X dollars one year ago and now have less than X dollars in that account, or are you counting a "loss" as a lost profit? Bad investor?

BTW, Since the election, I have had a 30% increase in income and stocks were so good I bought a new car and another for my mother.

960 2018-10-29 18:07:26 Why the hell is it so damn difficult to get a democrat to see the COMMON SENSE in how our economy is now. Jobs up, stocks up, economy soaring, killed ISIS, yet they bitch about untrue shit. I guess you can’t teach common sense, you can unwash a brained washed Democrat!! Unreal
961 2018-10-29 18:07:01 One only has to look at who owns the various media. LOL Taken with an eye to their slant, the reveal their alliances. MSM = oil and arms stocks amply rationalized w white ascendant myopia and jovial cold war team sports.
962 2018-10-29 18:06:55 Lol I've watched people cycle from stocks to options to potstocks to cryptocurrency then back to pot stocks... people chasing different markets only to get tanked on and chase retail money
963 2018-10-29 18:06:02 Hari emptied all his stocks. He is Suresh Krishna of this generation. Remaking his Hit movies for another movie.

966 2018-10-29 18:05:15 The embassy has nothing to do with Florida politics! What does matter is banning “bump stocks”, military style assault weapons and universal background checks! These are things that our current governor and wannabe governor DeSantis oppose! Republicans = NRA
967 2018-10-29 18:04:39 Look at stocks for companies that do prefabricated foundations. Also look at companies that manufacture the machines that grind up block and concrete on site to be reused as fill or for low strength concrete mix.
These will be bigger going forward IMHO.
968 2018-10-29 18:03:41 I am bullish on a number of stocks.  
That does not equate to being bullish particularly on the SPX and certainly not on the QQQ with what I am seeing.  
Passive index and especially FANG dip buyers could get hurt more here.
969 2018-10-29 18:03:23 Hi Tweeps! Been watching the UK budget on TV - nothing much of note! As for stocks, they remain tentative today and for most (though not for me) it won't have been a good October! Off to Spurs vs Man City later (a game too close to call)!
970 2018-10-29 18:02:28 So have you lost some enthusiasm for stocks like CRBP for now? Because we are early in the cycle? Thank You
971 2018-10-29 18:01:53 Wow. Ouch. Thanks. Across the board pot stocks killed
972 2018-10-29 18:00:12 If you never shut the fuck up about how amazing you are when your stocks go up, then go radio silent when your shitty stocks go down, you may be @Professor_Money, the man who can make $500k and blow it and more in less than a week.  #FRAUD #SCAMMER #MORON #BROKE
973 2018-10-29 17:58:35 Everywhere just stocks fevertree now.
974 2018-10-29 17:56:47 Piers, we already gave up our bump-stocks. How much more do you people want?
975 2018-10-29 17:55:59 Regular problem down here. Dealer stocks lots of them, I think they said 32 sold last year.   Mine went on 7760 this year.
976 2018-10-29 17:55:52 Lord, this country is sick. We've got KIDS leading the way on gun control because they've been begging not to be killed at school for decades, and us "wise" adults cant even ban bump stocks.
977 2018-10-29 17:55:29 Agree. Rising interest rates also can cause stock markets to correct. Stocks compete with bonds and treasuries.
978 2018-10-29 17:54:24 So if inflation is truly coming, isn't that going to make the price of all asset classes rise including stocks, housing, etc?
979 2018-10-29 17:54:17 ...that is my mind set per gain in stocks and also in losses in stocks when trying to figure out how best to hold or take profits/losses.
980 2018-10-29 17:53:55 Auto Stocks Surge On Report China Weighing 50% Cut To Car-Purchase Tax
 
The Stoxx 600 Automobiles & Parts index rose 3.8% on the news, its strongest intraday advance since July 5, making it the best-performing sector of the wider European gauge, which is up 1.1%.
981 2018-10-29 17:53:26 ... aaand Nasdaq slips back into red, plus treasury yields on the rise again (that latter is now relentless - they come down on the days peeps are selling down stocks, but rise immediately on share rallies (and institutions are now not buying the dips but selling rallies).
982 2018-10-29 17:53:24 Now that stocks are cheap again, I think it would be fun to have a "stock-sub"... Someone who sponsors stocks for me to invest in. Sounds like fun to me! #findom #stocks #stocksub #investmentsub

984 2018-10-29 17:52:30 Don't forget your secret Santa this year all the gin marmalade until stocks run out will come in a free organza bag. Lots of different colours . £3 each .
985 2018-10-29 17:52:24 Just remember stocks are like anything else, cars, furniture or houses. They are only worth what someone is willing to pay for them.

987 2018-10-29 17:51:16 Stocks ain’t a game for the poor, I lose $110sgd within 4mins20secs. How many hours do I have to work to earn it back. Itchy hand sleep dw sleep
988 2018-10-29 17:51:00 I good with that.  Bump stocks, extended magazines etc should be out lawed. Civilians just don't need them. IMO.
989 2018-10-29 17:49:56 so now it's screw fundamentals and the fed, the only thing keeping stocks up is an act that used to be illegal
990 2018-10-29 17:48:37 Other than that , out all other stocks 
Except Long $HBM-TO hudbay from late last week $5 and still have my $APS-TO waiting for news.  Gold miners still not ready to get back in yet, had a good run.
991 2018-10-29 17:48:29 I like casino stocks...   $LVS $WYNN and others...  once a China deal is made I think these go higher. For now, just wait a litttttle longer 
992 2018-10-29 17:48:08 a lot of inv enthusiasm on that idea - also on the ideas fed eases because stocks are sinking. Most companies that reported q3 already guided q4/2019 lower so buybacks won't help EPS next qtr or later, so why waste $ on that? We'll know soon enough if they do and if it helps
993 2018-10-29 17:47:31 Comments like that make me question your understanding at even a cursory level. . . 

market has been ripping . . . .  if 100% of stocks are up, for simplicity, ~50% will have negative alpha.
994 2018-10-29 17:46:37 ..for example 0.50 to upwards of maybe $2 a share gain for the many pot stocks I own would a good starter for a decent recovery in last 2 months of 2018, gets me about 1/5 to 1/4 of losses back, back to ytd highs or near ytd highs for that part of my portfolio.
995 2018-10-29 17:46:35 Almost all tech stocks are down 10-20% the last month
996 2018-10-29 17:45:05 @madan_kumar , a person riding trends on say, a 20 dma, only on the long side, of stocks of companies with good fundamentals, in a sector in the uptrend.....and exiting if price consistently moves below the 20 dma.....would you call him a trader or investor ?
997 2018-10-29 17:44:47 If stocks are unable to make new highs, I expect a double top and lower lows.
998 2018-10-29 17:44:42 goes perfectly with shorting pot stocks :-)
999 2018-10-29 17:43:57 The #Mormon church has $32 B in stocks. They have vast real estate holdings, malls, hunting reserves, apt buildings, farms, a newspaper, a radio channel, a cultural center in Hawaii, & 159 great & spacious temples. They give about $10 per member per year. Just like Jesus taught.
1000 2018-10-29 17:43:44 stocks rise by 1%.
1001 2018-10-29 17:43:38 When stocks are weak/strong all month, the last couple of days are often the opposite.  We shall see, as we really have not had many weak months
1002 2018-10-29 17:43:21 Any stocks for Tuesday Intraday?
1003 2018-10-29 17:43:09 I’d buy 2k worth of anything but stocks rn
1004 2018-10-29 17:42:14 I am a chartist-forecaster.. I rely on macros & TA more than FA.. But look around. What is NFLX PE? Can they keep growing at the same rate? Why are all the tech stocks including AMZN crashing? Econ is good but how are the pillars that support it?
1005 2018-10-29 17:41:59 As we enter earnings season for Cdn Energy sector these are the stocks I am holding with a few bucks to spare to add into year end.  $WCP-TO Whitecap Resources .  $PEY-TO PEyton  , $POU-TO Paramount Res, $PD-TD Precision Drilling , $CVE-TO Cenovus.  Exited $ECA and $CPG for now
1006 2018-10-29 17:41:55 Yes, leverage is a useful tool in investment. But in order to be able to leverage, you have to have assets, property, stocks, equity. What are you going to leverage with an 830 credit score and no money? Lmfao
1007 2018-10-29 17:41:14 Why are stocks doing so badly lately my shit plummeted
1008 2018-10-29 17:41:04 SCON What’s your  position on it? I wish you had IM here so I could discuss stocks privately. I enjoy your posts, and I understand them on the pre. You get a daily Bravo! for ideas. Are you making profits...
1009 2018-10-29 17:41:01 Me neither. I have 4.3m In stocks tjatvive collected since 1990 and always order more
1010 2018-10-29 17:40:48 Oh it was amazing! Loved the most haunted clips and obvs nothing funnier than Bobby Davro in stocks! Xx
1011 2018-10-29 17:40:15 A mutual fund is a type of investment opportunity that pools money from many investors — or shareholders — to purchase stocks, bonds, or other securities. A professional fund manager is employed to make decisions about the fund and monitor its performance.
1012 2018-10-29 17:39:16 "stocks with quality and defensive traits, low debt, valuation support, and above-average and growing dividend streams" sounds like my entire investment strategy, even in bull markets. that explains why i'm poor.
1013 2018-10-29 17:39:10 @EA u guuuuuys up your stocks game plz
1014 2018-10-29 17:38:40 Because many of those who claim to want gun control actually want gun elimination. Just ask Nancy Pelosi I'm sure her answers to the AR-15 would be the same as it was to bump stocks it would be a good start.
1015 2018-10-29 17:38:33 Hello, thanks for your question. A customer’s account value is based on the assets they’re invested in and the performance of those assets in the overall market.  Stocks have been flat to negative for returns since December while fixed income has been moderately negative. (1/2)

1018 2018-10-29 17:37:34 After days of cynical sentiment in the markets. UI 44 Average posted a biggest single day gain ever, closes above by 3.34 per cent on Monday, 29 Oct - buoyed by Financial, Healthcare and Industrial sectors. Only three stocks closed in negative territory.

1024 2018-10-29 17:35:00 Stocks attempting a comeback attempting to make up for deep loses last week. Dow now up 106 points.
1025 2018-10-29 17:34:44 Maintaining asset allocation is the only sane thing to do. It encourages a bit of selling at tops (sometimes), and buying after corrections (assuming you weren't 100% in stocks). It takes the psychology completely out of the decision.
1026 2018-10-29 17:32:53 $Tcehy who is displaying that huge asks?  End of the China stocks play?
1027 2018-10-29 17:30:08 I'd use any rallies in stocks to get liquid.  This is not a time to be long stocks for the ear or intermediate term.  jmo  If I'm wrong I have no problem buying higher.
1028 2018-10-29 17:30:07 Inflation somewhat tame in September.  Consumer spending rose in September. U.S. Stocks take a beating in October.
1029 2018-10-29 17:30:05 There are 70 million gun owners in this country...if we were a problem you would know it. 

NRA advocates for stronger background checks and advocated for banning bump stocks. They advocate for responsible gun ownership and education. 

The NRA is not the problem

1057 2018-10-29 17:18:23 Bump stocks are banned.

You don’t have a good understanding of rights and privileges. Gun ownership is not a privalige it’s a right.

Lastly, I made three suggestions that can keep kids safe at school and you blow those off and are back to limiting gun rights. Hence your prob.

1067 2018-10-29 17:14:23 Is it true that the stocks that were first to fall and suffered the most damage,  are also the first ones to recover?

1071 2018-10-29 17:13:00 Because I agree that bump stocks are bad, but you could easily build one out of parts from the hardware store so good luck banning them. An M-16 can shoot full auto so I’m fairly sure you have no idea what you’re talking about.

They specifically referenced bump stocks, which allow the gun to fire full auto. And calling it not “particularly powerful” is laughable. It’s the same platform as the M16 you bootlicker.

1079 2018-10-29 17:10:08 I think the decline is, in some cases , exacerbated by the quants and algos piling on to stocks in decline. Buyers live higher, sellers live lower. I do NOT think the decline is caused by short sellers, after a decade of a bull market.

1116 2018-10-29 16:57:29 It depends on the person but most basic level everyone uses Margin and Loan accounts. Margin is typically used to buy stocks without using your cash and then later on paying off the interest with the money you make off it it then having revenue left over.

1122 2018-10-29 16:53:03 If one is a momentum investor following the literature rigidly, one would rebalance on a 12 or 6 month relative performance with a 1 month look back. These stocks and indices were looking great 1 month back from today. A month from now they won't be.

One reason is that a sharp enough decline in stocks and bond yields, as investors turn to bonds for safety, could lead the Federal Reserve to become less aggressive on rate hikes. “The odds are that we elongate the recovery,” he says.
1145 2018-10-29 16:43:09 Mentally strong to withstand the volatility.  I do my due diligence, take a core position and add an attractive entry points. I am in MJ stocks for the long-run.  What happens between now and then is noise...admittedly a very loud noise.
1146 2018-10-29 16:43:01 yea once people figure out new ceo
1147 2018-10-29 16:42:27 Dans un tourne-dos, on m'avait expliqué que puisque peu de gens commandent la Kadji, les bars qui l'ont peinent à l'écouler. Du coup, ils ne renouvellent pas leurs stocks de Kadji quand ils s'épuisent enfin.
1148 2018-10-29 16:41:46 Yeah!!  We really need to ban bump stocks...
1149 2018-10-29 16:41:43 The $ES chart made its way to the largest magnet we've ever seen, ever, on any chart (2700), and then proceeded to fill Set Divergence back down after market open.

1150 2018-10-29 16:41:41 I recommended that #MRPro members short $NVDA at $276.  Good call - except I recommended covering at $218.  $191 now - down 35%...in October!  Bad call. Definitely seeing giveups here.  Trapdoor stocks - tough to "invest" in this environment.  But we try... $QQQ $SPX $DJIA $IWM
1151 2018-10-29 16:41:39 What about “bump stocks”, what about assault rifles and military style weapons? What about universal background checks? Republicans are just NRA sellouts! Vote Democrat and get sensible gun legislation!
1152 2018-10-29 16:41:18 Interesting day in markets. Looks like a full-on correction for tech stocks?
1153 2018-10-29 16:41:17 As the stocks are dropping back to when Trump began. Big deficit increase due to tax cuts.  Price increases due to tariffs.  No tax write offs for high medical expenses (I have leukemia and I know personally).  Yup, real good only for the rich.  Brainwashed theocratic morons.
1154 2018-10-29 16:41:09 Using only GIFs from the Halloween franchise, describe how your FANG stocks are performing in October.
1155 2018-10-29 16:40:19 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $RHT, $BWA, $GT, $ADTV, and $M.
1156 2018-10-29 16:40:14 This is the big misconception I'd like to dispel - the AR-15 is *not* automatic . Automatic is where you hold down the trigger and the gun keeps shooting . Semi-automatic is one pull = one bullet . But bump stocks are a modification that can make certain rifles act like an auto.
1157 2018-10-29 16:39:29 Hoddles uncle used to drink in the Stocks so there's Northern Blood in them Veins ! Speedy recovery Glenn !
1158 2018-10-29 16:39:19 Yup, when he starts its on  but til then

1163 2018-10-29 16:38:05 @MeghanMcCain  Can we agree on a background check for AR-15's a good check that includes social media, a minimum age of 21, no bump stocks, no large clips.  The owners are responsible for most mass murders in the US
1164 2018-10-29 16:37:59 Of course! The fact that most L's don't own stocks (with some exceptions regarding private pension funds, but it's not much, as repeatedly shown by @tghilarducci & others) makes the stock market an expression (instrument?) of K in #class #conflict.
1165 2018-10-29 16:37:42 Scooped up $TSLA when it dipped under $300, easy win. Now I’m buying up $AMZN & $NFLX on this dip. When fundamentals haven’t changed, buy the flash sales! #easywins #stocks #netflix #amazon #tesla #trading #investing
1166 2018-10-29 16:36:59 Lazar needs to start selling them, he has a collection now but no sales
1167 2018-10-29 16:36:34 Not gonna lie, I like seeing #cannabis stocks light on fire. All the know it all kind are throwing darts, welcome to the real market! Will be picking some up when charts are sliding.
1168 2018-10-29 16:36:13 if my fuckin stocks would skyrocket then yeah, that would be great 
1169 2018-10-29 16:36:09 On this day in 1929, 16 MILLION shares were sold at  prices. By mid-November $30 BILLION of the $80 BILLION worth of stocks on the NYSE will have been wiped out.

1173 2018-10-29 16:35:17 These are in and out days... recover and continue to correct... stay green even a 1% return is a better return than nothing.... Look for puts on stocks which you would like to hold...or profit on...stay green guys

1179 2018-10-29 16:32:39 It’s already showing today. Time is telling quite quickly!         This day trader is shorting stocks because trump is a financial cancer on America’s ass. By the way I refuse to capitalize his name on purpose.

I don't see this as one of the hot air stocks. Going to be some serious rerates both ways over the next 3 or 4 months I suspect. Some utter crud up 40% in fairly quick time.

1250 2018-10-29 16:14:42 That's okay . I just think that fetishizing this one rifle is counter productive . We have stricter gun laws in Canada , but it's not illegal to own one here either . IMO the bump stocks is the big problem in the USA

1271 2018-10-29 16:08:16 Bumpstocks don’t reload a gun, they turn a semi-automatic gun into a fully auto. Also as of the beginning of October, there is a federal ban of bump stocks in its final stages. If you are gonna be anti 2A at least do research first 
1272 2018-10-29 16:08:08 I see what you’re trying to say but it’s not exactly the same scenario. Peter Schiff couldn’t have known that the fed would succeed in reflating a huge bubble. But the reasons for stocks to be in a bear market are as clear as ever, so every investor should be able to see it.

1279 2018-10-29 16:05:54 I was responding to another person about Albert and it had to do with stocks and also where I live there is more jobs then there is people I see nothing but signs for help
1280 2018-10-29 16:05:51 you can ask your friend. If you have 5 stocks at least, she can accepted
1281 2018-10-29 16:05:49 It's actually a bloodbath not a bounce ...after all it's Monday  #stocks #stockmarketcrash
1282 2018-10-29 16:05:42 It’s basically double from when he started.  The moment he was elected stocks consumer confidence and the Dow has been growing. Feds raising the interest rate has been slamming it though.
1283 2018-10-29 16:05:24 Casey Research had this level called stink bid where theyd advise you to buy if they hit such a low price. After 2013 these stocks just kept blowing right through their lowest prospective price. They couldn't set a price low enough.
1284 2018-10-29 16:04:49 Would people really buy their stocks knowing they screw both drivers and passengers?
1285 2018-10-29 16:04:05 But think of their stocks! 
1286 2018-10-29 16:03:45 Ugly action.  $QQQ Tech stocks resuming sell-off.
1287 2018-10-29 16:03:14 What stocks to do you own? Lock Stocks and Barrels?
1288 2018-10-29 16:00:49 You’re actually confused thinking you know how the stock mkt works. BTW, we are not trending downwards. That’s it. If you can’t tell that, you have no business telling others about stocks.
1289 2018-10-29 16:00:22 Boy, tech stocks.
1290 2018-10-29 16:00:14 If the Repubs keep house, then there's no reason for fed to stop raising rates. Especially, if stocks blast off to near Dow 30k. Rates are going over 4%. Real estate is toast, if that happens.
The elite dont care, because they already own tons of land. Too rich for foreclosure
1291 2018-10-29 15:59:58 $SNAP in a correction or downturn market gimmick stocks like this will be the first to go
1292 2018-10-29 15:59:39 $AMZN dragging the whole market unreal. #stocks
1293 2018-10-29 15:59:33 Ha it is stock. My 8 stocks are options playable.
1294 2018-10-29 15:59:18 Exactly as ever... Was like this in 2000, in 2002, or 2007/8. Only 6/7 stocks hold this from plunging hard... Now its reality time
1295 2018-10-29 15:58:02 What is a "Cover Rally" in the #StockMarket?  In order to close a short sell we Buy to Close creating the price charts #Bullish.  This is when you will be tempted to #BuyTheDip but be patient as we move out of #Corrections #Stocks $SPY $QQQ $SPX $COMP $NQ $ES #Trading #Patience
1296 2018-10-29 15:58:00 Another new late morning low - this rally won't last. Still too many sellers. $SPX is down to 2681 - this tells those of us who love to sell puts to take our time and pink in "stink bids" - which means ask high prices for far out of the money puts on stocks I would own.
1297 2018-10-29 15:56:32 After eight weeks, a Sign of Strength day, with good internals, some nice advances and couple of stocks making to the new leadership board. Not a sign of bottom, but a positive signature for a few stocks.
1298 2018-10-29 15:56:24 Would you all like another Webinar? LOVE talking about the the Markets and how to make money!  (and how not to Lose a lot of money.)  If you would like another webinar, what would you like me to cover? #stocks #stocks #investing
1299 2018-10-29 15:56:11 Right now, stocks rising only fuels higher rates. Higher rates caused the stock market plummet in the first place
1300 2018-10-29 15:55:22 twtr Jack we do really need an edit button.

1302 2018-10-29 15:53:19 If you trying invest in weed stocks todays a good day to buy  they lost 20% value
1303 2018-10-29 15:52:58 >>The point is stocks don’t earn daily interest.<<

The original post never mentioned “interest” —that was your error. Ever heard of dividends? Try actually investing sometime maybe.
1304 2018-10-29 15:52:37 Hurry buy GoDaddy stocks. After the MAGA boycott of Nike the stocks soared. MAGA boycotts are moneymakers for liberals.
1305 2018-10-29 15:52:32 "Accelerate what we're doing today". This could mean also "sell stocks and go fishing for the rest of our life". #win #33B$
1306 2018-10-29 15:52:11 My stocks are in the shitter, my insurance premiums are going up, the tax cut didn’t get to me because I am middle class. So where is all this great news. Get your head out of the sand.
1307 2018-10-29 15:52:09 yes...helpful for sure.  I don't know how you keep track of all your stocks, put out all those tweets, AND respond to questions.  Multi-tasking at its finest.  :-)
1308 2018-10-29 15:52:04 The rupee is Asia's worst-performing currency this year, and foreigners have pulled the most money out of domestic stocks this month since January 2008.
1309 2018-10-29 15:51:53 I have not heard anything from mushroom daddy and jr about the stock market since it’s lost so much in the last few weeks. What happed when you were all out there all over bragging about the stocks just a few short weeks ago
1310 2018-10-29 15:51:31 well it will either close because bonds rally or because stocks rebound (or a little of both)
1311 2018-10-29 15:50:43 Stocks are up today. But a busy week ahead awaits, with many more blue chips set to report their earnings. I'll discuss with @jchatterleyCNN on @cnni just after noon ET.
1312 2018-10-29 15:50:25 Chinese market coming. Good for Tech stocks
1313 2018-10-29 15:50:11 Like the Nike boycott? Nike is doing better then ever.

If you boycott GoDaddy, give me notice so I can purchase some stocks.

A #MAGA boycott is good for business.

1315 2018-10-29 15:49:39 @jimcramer Good morning Jim Cramer. I wanted to get your thoughts on what you of 2 stocks. I already own shares in BABA and Facebook, and wanted to put more shares in both since they are near 52 week lows. I am curious to know what you think.
1316 2018-10-29 15:49:25 Deberíamos agotar los stocks del original de Saint Exupery para incentivar a un nuevo tiraje. #SaintExuperyoriginal
1317 2018-10-29 15:48:30 Remember the Nike boycott? It’s shares climbed to the highest level ever.

Go ahead try to boycott GoDaddy. Give me notice so I can purchase some stocks first.

1319 2018-10-29 15:48:15 yep this is power move for the week , there is some mixed weakness in FAANG stocks but when they recover tomorrow or end of day we will peak by then ...- assumption no prediction. I like the bid stuffing  unlike last week.
1320 2018-10-29 15:48:11 Who knows about stocks.....HML 
1321 2018-10-29 15:48:05 Good morning all! I think I’m ready to start investing in stocks! What can I get for $8? (Seriously, if anyone can give me some guidance or a crash course, I’m listening. )
1322 2018-10-29 15:47:19 Fantastic!!! Congratulations!! You're on a roll now. No hurry, but if you haven't already, you might start planning for your steps of progression into higher levels of competition. Perhaps aiming for World of Outlaws if you like Sprints best? Or more rides in ARCA if stocks?
1323 2018-10-29 15:47:18 Hold the phone.  O'Neill of Investor Business Daily proved on a 52 week basis "stocks that are high, go higher, and stocks that are low go lower".  Disproving your theory. No offense.

1326 2018-10-29 15:46:25 With so much volatility in the #stockmarket, makes some sense to buy #RHT at the low today and wait for the #IBM merger to get the $190 price. #RedHat was $177 at the high, so either way it's win win. Unless I'm missing something.  #stocks

1334 2018-10-29 15:45:08 Technical analysis is ONE of FOUR primary metrics (fundamentals, structural, psychology are the others).  If TA were the ONLY metric, stocks would be 'better' higher and 'worse' lower, which is an inherently flawed approach.  $SPX $NDX
1335 2018-10-29 15:43:40 4 weeks ago today “Don’t Boo” Heller (R-Adelson) celebrated one year of doing absolutely nothing about assault weapons, bump stocks, background checks for domestic abusers, the mentally ill,even terrorists.

1371 2018-10-29 15:28:36 The stock price of US stocks have little to do with how the middle class and poor people are doing. It is is an indicator of how the rich are doing. Over 80% of stock ownership is by the 1% of the rich. 50% of American people earn $30,000 or less.
1372 2018-10-29 15:28:26 The drop was not a little. Your stocks were doing very well before drumpus.
1373 2018-10-29 15:28:09 I would not be holding the following stocks
$BABA - shareholders are lucky the market is not down by 300 points as it would be a lot worse. $130 comin
$ACB - This stock is facing pricing pressure qtr over qtr for its weed, & there r 100's of players lined up to enter this space.
1374 2018-10-29 15:26:47 The US law system is dump as fuck. See McDonalds coffee case, or the pet in microwaves. And kids are allowed to handle fire arms, while Kinder surprise eggs are forbitten. Also full auto guns are banned but bump fire stocks are legal. You just need the better lawyer to win.
1375 2018-10-29 15:26:21 Sì quello sempre.
Per me è da una settimanina circa che un qualche tipo di value hunting su carta e stocks si sta sondando però.
Ci hanno provato in area 300 spread fallendo. A 320 ci han riprovato con qualche successo.
Provo a fare analisi tattica...
1376 2018-10-29 15:26:19 75% of stocks in S&P 500 are down more than 10% 
Nearly half are down more than 20%
More than half of the S&P 1500 are down at least 20%

1377 2018-10-29 15:25:36 Depneds. Cash in hand is a depreciating asset. However using 70K at 6% interest to invest in a high yeild opportunity such as stocks, business ventures, or real estate is (almost) always the better path (however riskier but can't gain without it) and how you actually gain wealth
1378 2018-10-29 15:25:22 I think icies may have one of the best and least commital options at dealing with it outside of universal tech line power shield. Pretty sure you both lost stocks to laser getting eaten and landing on the hammer hitbox of neutral b lmao
1379 2018-10-29 15:25:17 Yep but the in stocks i opening to SG first. Do u know if anyone want to do GO for INA?
1380 2018-10-29 15:25:03 $TSLA Other tech stocks down and Tesla up heading to the target at 374.00.
1381 2018-10-29 15:23:50 Stocks have nothing to do with jobs. Sticks have only to do with expected corporate profits. Employment was trending up since 2009. Forgot that? The stock market was going up since 2009. Forgit that? The GOP wants to steal Social Security.  Forgot that?
1382 2018-10-29 15:23:32 Even in India most of the companies buy back stocks to creates wealth of shareholders because in this budget gov. Introduce taxation on dividend who earn more than Rs 10 lakhs even companies also pay dividends distribution tax also.
1383 2018-10-29 15:23:31 Remember what I have been saying for MONTHS: This is not the environment in which you want to be favoring #techmania stocks. It's one in which you want to favor #SafeMoney ones. Think $XLU $XLP and so on, not $XLK
1384 2018-10-29 15:23:18 You can see the air in the stock bubble leaking out of  stocks like $NFLX, $NVDA, $amzn, $BA and $TREE, but this Fed-created Frankenstein has a LONG way to deflate.  Should be a blast to trade from the short-side...
1385 2018-10-29 15:23:01 hmm i think it’s one of those stocks you buy and hold for at least 10 years because it goes up and down so much. i’m mad because my profit doubled 3 months ago and i didn’t sell i kept like a dummy lol
1386 2018-10-29 15:22:58 The drainage of stocks is due to tariffs right?
1387 2018-10-29 15:22:12 Stocks are trading in Positive Territory while reports come out of China that they may cut their Auto Tax in half.  MBS is down 12bps and Yields have climbed up to 3.11%.  Be sure to take a look at Today's Market Report for more info coming up in a bit!

1392 2018-10-29 15:21:34 To not understand cannabis consumers, is short sighted. Stocks are way over-evaluated. Sales will NEVER be better than what has already been seen. How can stores have line-ups around the corner and stock prices still drop? I hope all you profiteers lose your shirt.

1406 2018-10-29 15:16:12 Current market narrative: "company guidance this quarter is horrible!" The facts: ~63% of companies that have provided guidance so far have issued negative guidance, 7% *less* than the 5-year average (70%). It's stories vs. statistics. Over the short-run, *stories* win. #stocks

1532 2018-10-29 14:31:29 When stocks stage dramatic declines, we're often asked whether it is time to panic (and sell). (Answer: No). But no one asks if they should panic (and buy stocks) when the major averages shoot higher.

This economy isn't as strong as most believe, the govt is bailing out stocks thru buybacks at the expense of real growth initiatives.

1923 2018-10-29 11:32:16 Stocks are plunging. Cost of borrowing money is rising and everything feels shaky. Last month alone S & P 500 index funds dropped close to 10%.

1935 2018-10-29 11:22:07 correct, I forgot about Nov. 16. Great comparison, and if Trump is in favor of the reduced Chinese car taxes, the US-car stocks will explode! Have a look at #gm and #ford

1984 2018-10-29 10:53:07 Tech stocks get frothy when market is positive but now the view is sell #China stocks and do not worry about the fundamentals as you do not want to get caught in the politics which are not easy to predict. Good bargains to be found, investors should be looking for entry points.

1990 2018-10-29 10:49:38 I do think certain stocks such as #Tencent are over sold. They hit a speed bump in gaming due to new regulations  but these will likely reverse 1 day. This is a great entry price for a really good company. Some investors are just selling on the back of the trade war with #China.

1992 2018-10-29 10:47:29 This is the phase where investors are turning to more fundamentals. It makes sense to me to see valuations drive decisions than the crazy valuations of concept stocks. As an analyst it is not even really possible to give a target price as it is all momentum.

1995 2018-10-29 10:46:34 Could be a good reason stocks are crashing

2149 2018-10-29 08:43:02 1. That CTAs are losing money at the same time as stocks is a prime example of the confusion between non-correlation and negative correlation. Easy to understand positive correlation (performance moves together) and negative correlation (performance moves in opposite  directions)
2150 2018-10-29 08:42:43 @CNBC_Awaaz How do you find most of Negative stocks in such a Positive market always. Don't you think this is creating wrong Impression? I am certainly not enjoying it.

29 October 2018
South African markets closed in the red on Friday, weighed down by broad based losses in banking and retail sector stocks. 85 stocks closed higher, 160 closed lower and 182 were unchanged. The All Share fell by 1.53% 
What to watch this week
2244 2018-10-29 07:11:08 Nifty taking reversal. There are some major reasons,
1. High vix indicating that fear is heavy 
2. Nifty going high with major stocks pullback.
3. Nifty giving flat to positive opening 
4. Rally coming from major bank stocks like Sbi and Icici bank. 
5. World market are negative

Devaluation is destroying the economy and the stock market.

It’s automatic:

- #PBOC raises #Yuan’s fixing to 6.9377 per USD, vs 6.9510 one day earlier.
- Stocks fall further to new lows.
- $620 billion in loans backed by shares.
- Stocks fall more.

2258 2018-10-29 06:57:35 That’s a bit sloppy though, given size and style they probably own a good chunk of more than half ASX stocks?
2259 2018-10-29 06:57:24 Right time to go for bottom fishing.

Many stocks are available at reasonable valuation and current price looks very attractive to take exposure.

2265 2018-10-29 06:49:53 Couldn’t agree more. The big question is; Is now the ‘correct’ time to buy stocks? No one will ever know until we’re proven correct :-)
2266 2018-10-29 06:49:51 yes, razor sharp focused hun. On her deeds, Obamas deeds, all the Dems dirty deeds. Yes I am focused, GLAD you noticed :) That President netted me over 24,308 bucks in 2 years. Stocks soared, I dabbled. 401 gained double what it was in 2 yrs. I was smart with my money and invstd
2267 2018-10-29 06:49:42 What has he done to help us. I don’t see it. My taxes have gone up, I pay more for food and gas, I’m embarrassed to tell people I’m American when I travel, I’m concerned about our debt and losing my healthcare, and my stocks are going down. children locked up and hate crimes...
2268 2018-10-29 06:49:07 China stocks tumble 2%, rest of Asia struggles to hold gains - MarketWatch
2269 2018-10-29 06:48:12 Should read, “Depressed by Chinese stocks”?
2270 2018-10-29 06:47:35 We’re almost done with No Meat October. If you’d like to cut back on meat in the future as well, remember that fish is a great alternative to meat. Eating fish from the #BalticSea is also an environmental act, as long as the fish was caught from sustainable stocks! #environment
2271 2018-10-29 06:44:43 October is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. Others are July, January, April, September, November, May, March, June, December, August and February. - Mark Twain.

2274 2018-10-29 06:42:38 2. Financial experts and CEO's of companies said that companies will use that money to buy back company stock. Trump said that he knew more than the experts and CEO's.
70% of that money is going to buy back company stocks which helps the CEO's and top executives (in the top 1%) .
2275 2018-10-29 06:42:32 Like in America, stocks will rise in Brazil
2276 2018-10-29 06:36:36 Stocks sell-off dominates agenda for investors
The sudden buckling in US equities has soured sentiment everywhere
2277 2018-10-29 06:35:36 There is no right or wrong time. Choose good stocks and stay with it for 5-10 yrs. In stock market time not timming is important.
2278 2018-10-29 06:34:52 While chatting quietly to the librarian about stocks, displays, etc., I felt a #nudge in my side.
'Look!' she whispered.
A young boy splayed across a blue beanbag, engrossed in his book, his face a huge grin, a frown, another grin. 
'That's my book!' I squealed.

2282 2018-10-29 06:32:36 Oh yeah the stock market where people buy shares & then sell them for profit or to live off of. Your not going to get endless gains. People have to sell to make money. Staring at your stocks on paper until death defeats the purpose. So people are cashing in. So save the outrage.

2285 2018-10-29 06:30:06 So what's better- Stocks or MFs? Where do we see better returns? As dealing in volume and the volatility backfire is bound to happen.
2286 2018-10-29 06:29:25 Future is not Stocks but Futures.
2287 2018-10-29 06:28:46 Btw. In the past when has been the best time to buy stocks? Usually after a ‘correction’. On that logic then, surely it was the ‘correct’ time to buy, therefore validating the term ‘correction’?
2288 2018-10-29 06:28:06 When there's no visible or tangible achievement, they quickly resort to their only stocks in trade - disinformation, misinformation, propaganda and lies. We'll continue to burst una bubbles at every step of the way

2291 2018-10-29 06:26:02 yes, exactly.

In this instance i expect most tech stocks to follow "Based on my analysis" not on my feelings.

You can keep trying to argue with me for the sake of arguing but i will just block you, i have nothing to prove.
2292 2018-10-29 06:25:30 We like round numbers to put a line in the sand. Eg speed limits Same goes for any measurement in life. Frankly, blind Freddy could see that stocks got way out of whack valuation-wise and needed to pull back. I’m happy to call it a correction because I think prices were nuts :-)

2299 2018-10-29 06:17:51 If prices get way overvalued they get corrected. Same if they’re undervalued. Trouble is we only call it a correction when our overvalued stocks get smacked back down to where they should be. No sugar coating it. Not calling it a correction is PC IMHO

2310 2018-10-29 05:59:34 Last 6 months, Market has been totally irrational & trader driven. But that is the nature of the beast.  It can remain so for even a little longer before maturing. E.g. For a 2% cut in earning, stocks have gone down by 20% in a day. If you call this a mature market, good luck.

2312 2018-10-29 05:54:30 This is my question: If the Founders had known they were writing an amendment about semi-automatic weapons, 3000 fps rounds, extended 30-round or larger clips, and bump stocks, do you think they would have worded that way?

I, for one, do not.
2313 2018-10-29 05:54:23 Seems like some insider trading going on before #JetAirways results. Stock is going down significantly relative to other aviation stocks. Just bought a 150 Nov put. Let’s see, the premium is very small so won’t lose much anyway.

2335 2018-10-29 05:24:56 I know there’s nothing in the constitution about shotguns  I would feel more comfortable with AR-15 if bump stocks were banned. Only a few states ban those devices. That’s what’s problematic. Can’t people compromise? I’m not anti-guns but I’d like stricter laws

2352 2018-10-29 05:05:13 Reviewing our 2015 files, I remembered that 2015 was such a dismal year in the markets that if your portfolio were entirely in cash, it would have outperformed USA stocks or bonds. Yes, really. It's the first time that happened since 1990.

2359 2018-10-29 04:55:28 $NDRA You can see similar volume discrepancies in all stocks (AAPL 10M vs 43M). Perhaps the bulk of the volume is not required to be formally reported? Still trying to get to the bottom of it myself. Any informed opinions out there? (2/2)
2360 2018-10-29 04:52:09 RedHat stock was at $180 a few months ago when negotiations were presumably happening. So $190 isn’t that far-fetched if you think tech stocks are oversold right now.
2361 2018-10-29 04:50:01 Things like cutting the sales of bump stocks and restricting access to firearms like the AR-15 based on criminal/mental health history is the most pressing idea. Not restricting 2nd amendment, but controlling access to high risk individuals makes sense to me.
2362 2018-10-29 04:46:25 @TheFarm51 If you want to keep gaining in stocks I recommend you start behaving like a serious developer,rather a bunch of "enthusiasts" hiding behind the developer label. It's not a profitable technique.

2500 2018-10-29 03:11:00 Seriously...Take automatics and large clips and bump stocks.  Still, the outlaws always have guns.  The angry deranged people always get a gun.  What solution do you bring forward?
2501 2018-10-29 03:10:53 Stop loop holes in background checks all selling locations.  Stop assault weapons/bump stocks.  No large magazines. Easy aid to reduce gun violence.  Why is this so hard??? Why are fathers and mothers so obstinate.
2502 2018-10-29 03:09:37 @Ford since you advertise on @FoxNews I can only conclude that you approve of the #sexist #racist #Violence enduring #HateSpeach of @realDonaldTrump as such I can no longer support your company and will be selling my Ford stocks and any mutual funds that hold ford stock #NoH8

2517 2018-10-29 02:54:03 Hrm. Any reference number or anything I can use for this? The store claimed it was "while stocks last" and fobbed me off. Even though I purchased as soon as the online ordering was fixed and there should have been stock at that time.
2518 2018-10-29 02:53:44 Don’t hold your breath. This fool thinks he’s never wrong and never accepts responsibility for anything in this country...other than his stocks and their gains. Everything else gets deflected onto the victims and their wrong place/wrong time/unarmed rhetoric.

Four weeks ago, Trump said he was "two to three weeks" from a federal ban, but nothing yet.

It's been 392 days since a lunatic shot hundreds of concert goers in Las Vegas. 

What the hell is taking so long?

2530 2018-10-29 02:45:33 By this logic, there have to be armed “good guys”:in churches, schools, malls,movie theaters , concertsand everywhere groups gather. Maybe better to ban assault weapons, bump stocks and have better background checks along with psychological testing

2535 2018-10-29 02:42:38 I would support legislation outlawing all automatic weapons for civilian use, as well as magazines with a capacity above seven rounds. Bump Stocks and any other after-market products that increase a weapon’s firing rate or capacity would also be outlawed.
2536 2018-10-29 02:41:38 Funny how you & your cronies running for office aren’t talking about the TAX CUTS passed earlier this year:

2545 2018-10-29 02:36:54 Of course it does. If POC owned all the banks, stocks, land, etc. - it would be an entirely different ballgame. I’m not saying people wouldn’t notice skin color, or would no longer use racial slurs. I’m saying an even playing field economically would eliminate systematic issues.

2550 2018-10-29 02:28:05 No worries.  Thanks for the civil response, rare on social media.Thought's on bump-stocks?  (honestly, not trying to be a dick, just want to know that you think)
2551 2018-10-29 02:25:11 So, those listening in law enforcement; where do you stand on more restrictive gun laws, say, for easily-convertible assault-type weapons, bump-stocks, large magazines, armor-piercing cartridges, permissible numbers of weapons owned by an individual?
2552 2018-10-29 02:24:18 That's not how the market works.  Unless you invested in stocks that pay dividends, which are not necessarily affected by the stock value.  Or, maybe you are collecting social security, another item in the GOPs agenda to cut  Besides I got quite a ways to go before retiring so...

2567 2018-10-29 02:12:20 Investing $3k in two stocks during college and losing almost all of it. I didn’t find out about passive investing/index funds for another year. It was lucky my firm’s 401k was via vanguard. A friend also stopped me from putting funds after maxing the 401k in a 83 bp fee advisor.
2568 2018-10-29 02:12:11 Well Trump doesn't know because he's to poor to own stocks.
2569 2018-10-29 02:11:48 The old person who feels safer with a rifle or shotgun at each door, who is hoping to be able to live at home for the rest of his life, a dem to boot, probably won’t give up his guns, but he welcomes the removal of AR-15s, bump stocks, open carry, etc.  Welcomes gun laws.
2570 2018-10-29 02:10:23 Meant that about stocks.  But Gold expect to go up as you suggested!
2571 2018-10-29 02:08:58 Not really. Especially now that stocks are tanking. Its a recipe for disaster in the long run.
2572 2018-10-29 02:08:29 With the rejection of the one recommendation that makes sense to our playing stocks, CA have proven that they're money hungry rather than custodians of the game.

False. Stocks set an ALLTIME RECORD under Trump, & tho down, still higher than any point 09-16

2. NMDC - Planned long trades at the level 101.50 - 104
3. Amara Raza Battery - Planned long trades at the level 749-758

2589 2018-10-29 01:50:27 Late 2018, early 2019, a rampant rally in bonds will begin post #crash in stocks, followed by a further rally to sub 2%, perhaps sub 1%, if #Fed reverses to #QE and buys basically all govt debt. USTs crash, yields spike with everything else in the collapse of 2020/21 best guess.

2595 2018-10-29 01:44:27 Yeah, so the economy was booming since 2009. Sorry to remind you of that #fact. Trump inherited an already growing economy.  BTW, stocks have lost all gains made for the year. That was under Trump...
2596 2018-10-29 01:42:44 Well, when they deliver on one of them, I’ll reconsider my opinion. 

But the biggest gun org in the country shouldn’t be accepting the premise of gun control like they did with bump stocks (and the original assault weapons ban which they supported).

2601 2018-10-29 01:39:10 Most of the high liquid stocks are now out of ASM list, this will help the market with additional collateral/Liquidity in otherwise weak market..stocks like IBullventure, Bombay Dyieng and so many now out of ASM list..Great news for smallcaps/Midcaps.

2603 2018-10-29 01:37:11 Stick to stocks.  What you just said, made absolutely no sense at all.
2604 2018-10-29 01:36:52 First of all, most millionares are first generation millionares.   Look it up, around 80% made their money, and did not inherit their wealth. They also take risk.  Stocks go down.  Companies go out of business.  Debts go unpaid. There is no unemployment line for bad investments.
2605 2018-10-29 01:36:52 #1... I’m an investor so that’s a no brainer. That’s free money to invest in the markets. $50k used as leverage in the currency market, $50k in Options trading, $50k in Crypto, $50k marijuana Stocks.. let the rest sit. Rinse repeat..
2606 2018-10-29 01:35:05 Like for example the never ending market pump by you at a time of record high valuations? How many people have lost money in Snap and other outrageously expensive stocks after watching analysts peddle fictional estimates of future earnings on your show?

Look in the mirror first
2607 2018-10-29 01:34:35 There was a caller on @mrjamesob who supplied medical equipment to the NHS and she said they order 6 months in advance so any realistic increase in stocks would need a year for suppliers to increase production. Did the gov. even inquire whether supplies are in place to stockpile.

2618 2018-10-29 01:26:19 Even twitter TL, comments & replies indicate how many are persisting with the tracking & investing in stocks.
2619 2018-10-29 01:24:33 So I might be a little late but, stocks are plummeting terrible 
2620 2018-10-29 01:22:51 @APompliano stocks not going up forever doesn't   help make a case for crypto. Stocks have fueled extraordinary wealth in our economy and price appreciation is arguably secondary to their fundamental purpose of financing companies. Can't say that for crypto. Yet.
2621 2018-10-29 01:22:03 Few weeks ago so called experts, advisers and chartists were giving rosy target of certain stocks,
now these stocks (yes bank, DHFL, PC Jew etc) is available almost 50 to 70%discount than why aren't they are not giving buy call?
%wise how much success ratio of these experts?
2622 2018-10-29 01:22:02 Yes. And the Fed has designed policy to pump stocks based on a theory without proof that the stock market being higher makes the economy better by causing people to spend more. I read a study showing that there’s no correlation because people don’t view stock values as permanent.
2623 2018-10-29 01:19:36 Yeah... no perfect measure. TTM has issue of short-term earnings issues (can look most expensive when most cheap). CAPE has issue of overweighting outlier regimes / ignoring impaired economies (example... in hindsight EM stocks weren’t so cheap this last cycle).
2624 2018-10-29 01:19:06 Instead of calling you "civil terrorists" NRA COULD call you "gun safety advocates" & work w/ you on things like universal background checks & bump stocks even majority of its membership favor.

Know kids surviving a mass shooting take it personally & NRA has hurt feelings but...
2625 2018-10-29 01:18:58 Business advice is often total crap, but what I do know is that don't play the penny stocks..

2627 2018-10-29 01:15:29 Pleased be informed that at the moment our Federico Mahora products stocks are very minimal in Malaysia.

2631 2018-10-29 01:12:26 Market-maker spreads widen during volatile market periods because of the increased risk of loss. They also widen for stocks that have a low trading volume, poor price visibility, or low liquidity.

2633 2018-10-29 01:09:23 The gaming stocks also don't seem like a great way to play it to me. The popular games are often made by smaller companies (e.g. Fortnite, Minecraft) and lots of games are flashes in the pan. By way of analogy, I want to invest in the TV station, not try pick the popular TV show.

2636 2018-10-29 01:03:59 Agreed - the gaming stocks are all very expensive. Tough theme to play on long side. On the short side though, I think one of the under-discussed implications is that it is a growing competitor in the 'attention/entertainment market' to traditional entertainment/media/sports.
2637 2018-10-29 01:03:54 He started by going in on Mexicans, just like his boy 45. Made more money from being hateful toward immigrants than he ever did in "money advice and stocks". Racism signs his checks.

2642 2018-10-29 00:59:50 “Stocks don’t go up in value forever” is misleading. Dow at 24k+ is pretty decently up ever since it was introduced. Millions of 401k have delivered great returns over 30+ yr.  what bitcoin would do in next 10 yrs is speculative. Let’s hope for the best!
2643 2018-10-29 00:59:22 I can't believe that bump stocks are still legal. What is wrong with this country. Wake up white people.
2644 2018-10-29 00:58:33 There’s going to be regret whether you’re in or out of the market. Regret if stocks go up and you’re sitting in cash or regret if you invest and stocks go down. The question is would you rather be out of the market when stocks go up or in the market when stocks go down?
2645 2018-10-29 00:58:17 Beer stocks are getting cheaper and cheaper ! 
2646 2018-10-29 00:58:14 Anyone who owned one prior to the ban is allowed to keep it. We need strengthen our semi-automatic weapon laws, and I agree on banning bump stocks. But, if a criminal wants to do mass damage...they will regardless of the law

2649 2018-10-29 00:56:58 Yes, Trump has made a giant impact on private prisons, I do not support this! Having said that Malcom’s approach is much more effective than Reid’s and it’s showing. The Philadelphia pension board dropped private prison stocks.
2650 2018-10-29 00:56:23 Hi. 
$QIWI’s price rose since Oct 10.
But stocks and oil markets are weak lately. It seems risk-off. I think $QIWI has the same situation, so I’ll wait and see.
On the other hand, gold price is rising, so I bought $AU $GFI $HMY.
Is my English correct ? Thank you !

2656 2018-10-29 00:51:58 PYPL has held up well. Don't you expect tech stocks to be strong on Monday after the IBM buyout of Red Hat for $34 billion?
2657 2018-10-29 00:51:00 When will the S&P go up and stop dropping? This volatile market is costing me thousands! POTUS make a trade deal with China soon and encourage the FED to drop interest rates for mortgages please! This great run up of my stocks has been a decline now in the last few months...
2658 2018-10-29 00:50:46 Your scenarios are completely missing the point. Investors obtained their wealth through ownership of stock. It doesn't matter if they keep it or sell it. Bezos owning $100bn of Amazon stock is exactly the same as me owning a $100bn portfolio of stocks
2659 2018-10-29 00:50:04 Dot com stocks outperformed general stocks during the boom but then lagged over a decade. I wish crypto assets to do well in future but misleading people with out of context tweet is poor judgement. Please act responsibly
2660 2018-10-29 00:48:37 Stocks over valued in 99 reset in 2000 and then grew on fundamentals for most of the next decade. The major reset in 2008, which your window highlights had nothing to do with over-heated stock market assets but the housing market, credit default swaps, etc.

2663 2018-10-29 00:45:12 Stocks are overvalued today just like in 1999. The people who called for negative equity return during the decade I mentioned, are calling for negative return for next 10 years now too.

BTC outperformed equities in last 10 years. My guess is it will outperform in next 10 too.

2665 2018-10-29 00:44:36 Stocks are up but history rhymes doesn’t repeat exactly the same. Issue was that you took the top of the market and the bottom of the market as end points. That’s the issue. And this comes from someone who is long $VXX (h/t @treehcapital) right now.
2666 2018-10-29 00:44:12 Yeah. That was one of two foray's I've ever made into buying individual stocks. Clearly not my cup of tea. I'm reminded of some folks I know who sold all their Apple stock when *it* was down to $5/share...and a couple who didn't.
2667 2018-10-29 00:41:33 The last time stocks were as over valued as they are today was in 1999. 

We are in the longest bull run in history. Bitcoin out performed equities in last 10 years. My guess is that it will out perform equities in the next 10 years too.
2668 2018-10-29 00:40:35 $SPY Many bears dreaming, to think shorting stocks/market is a slam dunk. It's rarely that easy. Trade what you see guys, bull and/or bear!

An observation?!? Losing, not winning what? The midterms? Are you suggesting growth is decelerating? Are you telling us stocks came off this month, which we all know?

2676 2018-10-29 00:34:43 So, picking date before dot com bust and picking dat soon after mortgage bust... is that cherry picking dates? 2003 to 2007 did pretty well I think. And depends on what kind of stocks you owned maybe?

2686 2018-10-29 00:24:52 and you’re right, hunting is definitely a tool in which a gun is quite necessary, but you don’t need a semi-auto rifle, high capacity magazines, or bump stocks to hunt. Those need to be limited because they serve no real purpose in our society
2687 2018-10-29 00:24:16 You play poker worse than you pick stocks.
2688 2018-10-29 00:23:17 I have bitcoin stocks and they jump up 1k every now and then.. still alive and well just not as booming as it was when it was first introduced... probably because the silkroad got shut down and ppl use Venmo instead 
2689 2018-10-29 00:23:05 - Strict background checks
- Ban Bump Stocks & assault-style rifles
- Increase age limit to purchase
- VOTE for Democrats!
2690 2018-10-29 00:21:35 When is this coming to head? Why would I let board members of @halcon_scificon know when I'm coming to their houses with court papers?

2691 2018-10-29 00:21:14 AR15s are NOT fully automatic. Even IF he used the bump stocks he had, the barrel would have gotten so hot, the weapon would have become useless.
2692 2018-10-29 00:20:20 This is our choice to stop gun violence  a. Have metal detectors and armed guards and entrances to so all schools. Synagogues churches and mosques also need security guard that have weapons. It’s still ok to sell at gun shows with no background check. Still buy bump stocks

2697 2018-10-29 00:16:28 A very reasonable list that even a gun enthusiast should endorse. Strict background checks, minimum age limit of 21yrs, the ban of automatic weapons (only military and law enforcement should have access to those) and the ban of bump stocks. Vote for sanity, vote blue.
2698 2018-10-29 00:15:40 Have to think the RHT deal puts a bid into cloud and software stocks tomorrow
2699 2018-10-29 00:14:56 Todo este escenario en los índices, equities, stocks, se va a extender hasta el primer cuarto del 2019.

2700 2018-10-29 00:14:05 @BillGriffeth Bill you’re a lot smarter than Adami. At 190, IBM paying only 7% premium over RHAT recent high of 177. Looks like a bargain price to me taking into account the big slide in Nasdaq tech stocks. Shallow thinking. IBM buying at fire sale price.
2701 2018-10-29 00:14:04 Fully believe in equity, but think the way stocks vest, exercise window, and the like are better way to resolve any mismatch in Upside. Too many horror stories about loans to buy shares then they get washed out or can't even buy them.

I don’t.

2715 2018-10-29 00:06:47 @GuyAdami  Premium you mentioned is misleading as RHAT selling at depressed level as most Nasdaq tech stocks . It’s High a few months ago was 177 so 190 is only a 7% premium off high. IBM got a great deal. It will help in major comeback. IBM Best Buy in mkt.
2716 2018-10-29 00:05:30 Corporate media speak for #WallStreet bosses who pay no taxes on speculation. #TrumpSlump means stock market bubble collapse now looms w/ weakening economy which gives FDR New Deal regulations new appeal. If #avenatti2020 #RealDeal taxes stocks bonds & derivatives sales they lose
2717 2018-10-29 00:05:03 Access to information has gotten better and markets are probably more efficient now than ever. Makes it hard to find “value”. At one point it was possible to find stocks that traded for less than the cash on the balance sheet. Those efficiencies just don’t exist anymore.

2719 2018-10-29 00:03:05 Actually I got assigned selling naked puts before the big fall. I sold covered calls already for December and I'm already at a 90% of the prime.
