3 2018-01-10 23:57:46 I’ve read through some of your tweets. I see now that you’re more of a traditional investor (stocks, etc). Maybe you’ve seen trading volume disappear as some investors have gone to crypto. Is this the main reason for your comments?
4 2018-01-10 23:57:04 So my stocks increased by $5. That’s a bit exciting.
5 2018-01-10 23:57:03 There came a point where I was basically broke, cash-wise.  I'd sold off stocks and all that was left was retirement savings, which I'd always said was untouchable, and I was contemplating just giving up and finding a job again.  But it's like something inside had awoken.
6 2018-01-10 23:56:13 The rebound in $NFLX and $NVDA  off the low today was very impressive (random thought). Shows these two are the top BTFD stocks right now and I would also throw in buying $BA any time it is red!!

52 2018-01-10 23:37:52 but generally yours and @WolfOfWeedST tweets just attack cryptocurrency and anyone involved. I’m not sure of the end game? People did the same sort of thing with the crappy pot stocks but @WolfOfWeedST wasn’t telling them not to blow money on that. At least from what I recall.

86 2018-01-10 23:17:20 You can go higher 30% or even 50 if you want but take risks on indv stocks or companies / real estate etc and a tiny amount in a bubble asset class like crypto.

One thing I should have mentioned is that all the stocks(but not cryptocurrencies) that show up in my 50 portfolios need to have a minimum price of $10/share. If it weren't for that rule, I think SIFY would have made it in there:-)

135 2018-01-10 22:43:20 Also another problem is they play well in their back is against the wall but they seem to have a lack of urgency sometimes earlier in the game and can fall behind and then have to shoot their way back in and they're not very good at shooting
136 2018-01-10 22:42:50 You’re reply doesn’t refute that your racist, belies any understanding of economics/diplomacy, ignores the average American’s actual economic tie to stocks, and uses a meme that is blatantly false. So, there’s that. But again, thanks for letting the internet know you’re racist.
137 2018-01-10 22:42:32 Cnt believe I’m in stocks
138 2018-01-10 22:42:30 there is room for both. stocks are easier though obviously, especially where retail money is involved.
139 2018-01-10 22:41:00 how can i reach you?
140 2018-01-10 22:40:09 Yeeeeaaaaaahhhh but aren’t all stocks speculative? If you wait for ole Jeff Sessions to find a bible verse that supports cannabis, you’ll be missing a ton of opportunities.
141 2018-01-10 22:40:03 You only need to make one big score in finance to be a hero forever. #trade #forex #stocks
142 2018-01-10 22:39:57 Half the team really struggles at defense to be fair but Middleton has taken a huge step backwards on defense which is concerning totally seems like lack of effort. He's even gotten really sloppy on passes but at least he puts up pretty good offensive numbers
143 2018-01-10 22:39:43 Nice! 
I've been doing a lot of research on cobalt stocks lately but I'm definitely going to start looking more all over in mining
144 2018-01-10 22:38:40 Our GDP is at a 4.0, Stocks up 5,000 points, our economy has grown by $Trillions, Isis is crushed.

If it was Russia collusion, I'd say we need more of it!!!

146 2018-01-10 22:37:48 Another thing that bothers me is those who want to do mass killings like Vegas. Bump Stocks should be banned from public. Chemicals used to make explosives should not be available to public. Time to think more about these issues.
147 2018-01-10 22:37:02 Coach is easy to blame and he may be the reason but until Middleton starts to wanting to play legitimate defense they are an average team. He’s the problem on the defensive end.  Effort dictates results
148 2018-01-10 22:36:36 Will WB invest in marijuana stocks? Solves a ton of issues and obviously a great investment. Just like #bitcoin (at the moment) , the taboo of such an asset class will keep big players away. The lack of education around both topics is disturbing.
149 2018-01-10 22:36:22 Yeah Retro Gaming is a lot like stocks you have to know when to buy or sell(if one is into selling) it is hard to predict when certain games or systems will start to be in demand.

154 2018-01-10 22:35:32 Indeed He does. RT @ShaneClaiborne: God cares more about the 200,000 Salvadorans facing deportation than whether stocks went up today.
155 2018-01-10 22:34:44 WSU would be like the faxes you get for penny stocks, promises of 400% growth that equal little real gain.

166 2018-01-10 22:30:58 Is it worth effort discussing LTCG tax on stocks, guessing LTCG tax rate, mode, implications or it's just waste of time?
167 2018-01-10 22:30:12 good question. The plan is the conviction. It was a review of hundreds of my trades that lead to this plan.  As for individual stocks, news and fundamentals have no significance.  Price and volume -- are my guides.

Really wish I had a stock trading account in the states right now. Would have gambled a little.


169 2018-01-10 22:28:08 Not only Gold been moving. Base Metal stocks have performed. If you don’t have your physical Gold now this is your last year to buy at good price.
170 2018-01-10 22:28:03 Thank you!! You’re lucky to have a group. I am getting ready to start a game soon but haven’t had the chance. Also Critical Role is how I met my boyfriend so it’s done a whole lot of good!

175 2018-01-10 22:22:28 if you graph world wages against stocks, which makes sense given how many companies are multinational, i bet the picture changes a bit
176 2018-01-10 22:20:59 Please tell her she's not alone. Critical Role led me to DND, which led me to a great group of friends who have been so supportive as I move past my own chronic pain issues. I'd have a lot less friends without the inspiration. Plus a lot less desire to follow my passions. <3

I was looking for Lithium stocks. I had great success with $GGI as well. 

Mining stocks are risky but I love it
180 2018-01-10 22:18:16 Maybe one reason is because so many Americans work in healthcare industry and many pensions are funded by health care stocks? It is a for-Profit industry in USA.
181 2018-01-10 22:17:59 S&P 500 closed at a 52-week high, while the VIX rose and there were at least 25% more declining than advancing stocks?

A rare one indeed...
182 2018-01-10 22:16:25 Ding ding ding. Here's another one. If people actually buy into ICOs, which haven't been well adopted yet (still early), why wouldn't everyone have their own? But unlike stocks only people with $1M net worth can invest. Different than equities, much small pool of $$$.
183 2018-01-10 22:15:56 they are all important, but The Commodity Course must be read (just as applicable for stocks)
184 2018-01-10 22:14:12 I have been experiencing data feed problem from my brokers. According to different sources, trading activities increase significantly. Easy money are insane for blockchain and weed stocks. This to me  is the beginning of the end. Though I occasionally trade those for fun.
185 2018-01-10 22:14:08 Oh my goodness, there's a shop ten minutes from my house that stocks your pizza! That's my dinner sorted for tomorrow  Can't wait to try it!
186 2018-01-10 22:11:42 Well it looks like some down pressure scared some investors today on $blgv. Imo it was bad timing ? Lots of downward pressure in general on some big stocks today but we will spin it all different right? I’m personally a believer.
187 2018-01-10 22:10:52 Let’s see how well I do investing in stocks 
188 2018-01-10 22:10:10 Lets not compare $KODK to all these low float, scam stocks please. much different game. KODK has significant debt position and >1/2B in pension & postretirement liabilities. The minuscule money they will make in kodakcoin adventure not going to help them. BK 2 is unavoidable.
189 2018-01-10 22:08:17 $XBI $XME relatively strong.  $XLF up before bank stock earnings.  Home builder stocks up after ER.
190 2018-01-10 22:07:23 Thing about stocks is once you feel like you got what came for or even more....cash tf out ASAP don’t be greedy cause you could lose what you came up on...

210 2018-01-10 21:56:31 After a sizable draw in #propane stocks last week, sources are blaming today's nickel drops from highs to lows for #propane at #Belvieu and #Conway mainly on bearish international arbs.  Normally prices go higher, but Belvieu dived first, followed by Conway.

220 2018-01-10 21:52:25 That's the end of the six-day rally for stocks. Quite a divide in the market so far in '18: growth stocks (energy, tech, industrials, banks) jumping while safer, high-dividend stocks are sinking as interest rates rise.
221 2018-01-10 21:52:22 The 11/26/12 issue of Time magazine

222 2018-01-10 21:51:26 Stop promoting your horrible tax plan like it’s the best thing for the middle class. It’s not wages not going up, companies are giving one time bonuses instead of wage oncreases. Companies buying back stocks instead creating jobs.  Your literally full of it.
223 2018-01-10 21:50:48 Remember when Barton Biggs recommended buying farmland, guns & ammo, and stocks?
224 2018-01-10 21:50:34 lets not forget that alot of the $$ being produced in the crypto market happens through the mining process.  not the same as fiat or stocks.
225 2018-01-10 21:49:44 Yeah, TOS is great for long-term or swinging but day trading is a pain. Hey Omar, have you ever tried the pivot points? I've been using it lately.  Works great for many stocks, especially those traded by the institutions

238 2018-01-10 21:46:00 3/.  I mean, a bubble is just too many people going into debt to buy an already existing asset.  Tulips, houses, stocks, BitCoin, whatever.  Then the stock of private debt gets so big, that eventually it exceeds the ability to pay.  So some stop paying...

252 2018-01-10 21:36:37 Optimists will point out that stocks are up, interest is down, and unemployment is down. Critical people will say we are experience political instability and people should be cautious. Either way, no one can accurately gage how the NYC market will be in the coming months.
253 2018-01-10 21:35:52 Bottom drawer SA Inc stocks for me are: Bidvest, Sanlam, Shoprite and Firstrand. But I don't think buy and forget is possible any more. All stocks are on probation. These just have very lax conditions.

263 2018-01-10 21:29:45 Not enough stocks to buy
264 2018-01-10 21:28:06 :O *buys Hotmail stocks*
265 2018-01-10 21:28:03 This morning I bought stocks, and this afternoon I recycled cans for money. I am consecutively broke and wealthy at the same time.
266 2018-01-10 21:27:43 Ever heard of penny stocks
267 2018-01-10 21:27:14 Have you never heard of penny stocks
268 2018-01-10 21:26:37 Come on. And grass is green. Whoever does not know that stock price is the total of expected future discounted net incomes divided by the number of outstanding stocks should not be investing in the market. Of course corporate tax breaks make the current price rise.

273 2018-01-10 21:24:08 $ABCN has been going nicely today  Yes! Interesting to see how $RTM will develop in the near future. Thanks for the tips, I will do some research on $FT & $ECS; I actually would like to buy some more mining related stocks! Checking out $NNO as well. Will get back to you

275 2018-01-10 21:23:46 i am an addict to the stock market. everyone thinks I'm on instagram and texting but in reality I'm always on coinbase, E*TRADE, coinmarketcap or stock twists. i go to bed late at night looking at stocks, i sleep about 3-4 hours a night because i wake up for the premarket. its
276 2018-01-10 21:23:35 I guess statically, thanks to today being "Down", we are free to rally for another 6 days...

277 2018-01-10 21:23:22 I do this before I buy penny stocks.
278 2018-01-10 21:23:15 something like that. i think ive also seen the one where you put a newspaper in front of a cat and go with the stocks the cat paws at
279 2018-01-10 21:22:59 My co workers be keeping me in the loop on what stocks to invest in 
280 2018-01-10 21:22:51 Buffett has never invested in tech stocks because he could never understand them. That quote comes from his mouth. Same goes for bitcoin. HODL bitcoin gentleman and ladies. Don’t let the big boys scare you off.
281 2018-01-10 21:22:50 Again I must ask you what stocks would you suggest people invest in when they don't have enough money to get by from day to day due to low wages?  They all deserve a hand up. America would be great if everyone made a living wage, no one was homeless, free medical & education.
282 2018-01-10 21:22:34 Just read something postulating a singular level for a 10yr yield, like 2.63%, will cause some mass equity exodus. That is crazy bullshit. Higher "real" rates negative for stocks yes. Higher rates psychological negative possibly, but a specific level? Bullshit.
283 2018-01-10 21:22:10 Priorities. We can't take care of the people of the nation b/c it might lower profit margins and stocks a fraction of a percent.
284 2018-01-10 21:22:05 Les pharmaciens j’espère qu'ils préparent les stocks pour Infinity War parce qu'on aura besoin d'un sacré paquet d'antidépresseurs

288 2018-01-10 21:19:56 What stocks would you suggest the middle class and the poor should invest in when they can't even get by from day to day and can't save a dime due to low wages?
289 2018-01-10 21:17:54 They will feel that extra coin in their pocket starting in 30 days.  No stocks needed to have more disposable income..
290 2018-01-10 21:17:45 Issa good time for stocks rn
291 2018-01-10 21:17:35 stocks are up today!! wow!
292 2018-01-10 21:17:30 1/2 Nope. There was a famine across the most fertile land of the Soviet Union because of bad harvest and the Soviets chose to sell their grain stocks to the West instead of helping those in hunger. Most of those dying were Russians, Kazakhs and others were also affected.
293 2018-01-10 21:17:20 Just read an article you wrote. I just want to point out. You said it is easier to by and trade stocks than it is BTC, LTC, ETH, etc,. However that seems to be a false narrative you are providing your readers. Easier to register, buy and sell on Coinbase or Binance than Stocks.
294 2018-01-10 21:17:20 Yes true. About 52% of Americans own stock & according to an article I read the richest 10% of households controlled 84% of the total value of these stocks in 2016. Many Americans are struggling because of high health care costs & stagnant wages & do not benefit from stock gains.
295 2018-01-10 21:16:44 I am talking about people who do not earn enough to move. People being exploited below the minimum wage. Sex workers who are being pimped or reliant on drug use. Women who are in Forces marriages having to do as they are told.  Not all folk can just up stocks and move
296 2018-01-10 21:15:52 A few things
Those high stocks and lower unemployment is due to the momentum from the last guy's presidency. We had a 4.5% unemployment and DOW of 18k when 44 left, you seem to be claiming 45's somehow the best president because unemployment's 4.2% and DOW of 24k

304 2018-01-10 21:12:25 Sorry don't understand 'impact investing'. I wish there were stocks supporting conservation (I'd be 1st in Q) but none that I know of other than Shoprite which in a roundabout way does much for water conservation etc.

318 2018-01-10 21:08:18 That ties in because they have meta shifts and only the new releases are legal. Any card game like that will have mega scummy people cause its easy to take advantage of a card being useless now and then being good later and profiting mega off it. Stocks.

337 2018-01-10 21:00:54 Right. It does feel like some coins are currently being treated more like stocks in a company than a currency, and being artificially peddled and manipulated in that manner.

339 2018-01-10 21:00:45 Damn you got 10 minutes?!  When I had a project like that for Economics we got two minutes to pick stocks and then after that we had to keep trading up to get over x amt of $.
340 2018-01-10 21:00:22 Stocks are called securities for the specific reason that they provide security
341 2018-01-10 20:59:45 Buffett also said he was bullish on stocks when we were in the middle of the financial crisis in 2008. Do we acknowledge that he was absolutely right, or do we wait to see if stocks crash again lower than when he bought? This is an absurd conversation.
342 2018-01-10 20:59:42 VIX shenanigans frustrate me. All my stocks ripping higher but account balance stays the same. Well at least it’s not going down?

357 2018-01-10 20:52:30 "Rather interestingly, holders of digital derivatives do not take delivery in bitcoin, as you might gold, silver, or stocks.". What has that got to do with coin holders? Derivatives are for the stock market gamblers.

388 2018-01-10 20:37:57 Success requires commitment; a whatever it takes, never quit attitude. When I began trading in the early 1980s, I endured a six-year period when

392 2018-01-10 20:37:28 Agreed.  Earlier when BTC was around 13,500 I saw huge bidders coming in.  I think big players are ready to throw money back into the crypto sector and push both BTC and crypto stocks up.  DPW and a few other crypto stocks are up pretty big.  They ran it down to push it up...

The Canadian dollar also fell, trading down 0.8% against US dollar. 

Mexican peso drops 0.5%.
395 2018-01-10 20:37:00 Ok. Press briefing is over... Yes. I have made tens of thousands of dollars since last year in the market as I thought it would go up sharply. That was with individual stocks like CAT,  MTW and others. Took profits. Bought other stock. IRA and 401k up tremendously!

401 2018-01-10 20:33:00 If you have trouble imagining a 20% loss in the stock market, you shouldn’t be in stocks.
402 2018-01-10 20:32:32 Well Norway has a great sovereign wealth fund so EVERYBODY benefits from stock market rallies and not just top 10% who own 84% of all stocks
403 2018-01-10 20:32:01 TY @FeverTreeMixers 4 making #DryJanuary manageable! Any chance of more 'light' drinks? & @Tesco pls increase ur stocks of light gingerbeer!
404 2018-01-10 20:31:13 Yes, 5$ stocks trading commission is to make more profits. My context was different and much broader and I am not sure if you are understanding that tough.
405 2018-01-10 20:30:41 En gros, les soldes sont faits pour vider les stocks des commerçants afin d’implanter au plus vite la nouvelle collection, qui elle, va rapporter. Car les soldes ça rapporter du ÇA, mais vu que tu peux vendre à perte... ça te paie pas ;)

407 2018-01-10 20:29:42 You just have to know what your buying. Dumb/new investors will get burnt on pump and dump stocks. Smart investors have the potential to win big with a stock like canopy growth.

409 2018-01-10 20:29:02 enough with Crypto. back to stocks I go,
410 2018-01-10 20:28:32 Anton , I trade stocks & crypto- and the latter is turbo-charged and operates 24/7 and not working hours per country. I think you are missing a gargantuan opportunity myself.
411 2018-01-10 20:27:49 Getting into some stocks. It’s kinda hard cuz you jugglin’ ya money but whatever. Scared money don’t make none
412 2018-01-10 20:27:42 Everyone knows the bond market has been manipulated by the FED to increase asset prices mostly seen through stocks.  Wait until they unwind, that is when volatility will return like never before.
413 2018-01-10 20:27:35 Poor Deadpool! Hey... shouldn't you be shooting a movie? Why the need to bash stocks? $OTTV
414 2018-01-10 20:27:04 Buffett hated tech stocks, never would have invested in Amazon or Google, never did, and guess what, now the top blue chip companies out there are blue chip tech. He just hates on what he doesn't get. admits that, so its probably a more bullish sign for crypto than anything else.
415 2018-01-10 20:26:44 @realDonaldTrump                   With the dollar value falling and gold rising!!!! Trump will cause the greatest crash America has ever seen. Sell your stocks now before it’s to late!!!!!!

421 2018-01-10 20:23:48 Are $RIOT & $ROKU considered bagholder stocks now? (word?)
422 2018-01-10 20:23:34 Yea, cryptos are definitely wild and exciting but crazy unstable and I have been getting heavy into the day trading or pump n dump stocks myself .. but really it takes money to make money .. the difference between playing with 1k and 10k are noticeable in returns
423 2018-01-10 20:23:02 @realDonaldTrump only cares about his ratings and the stock market ... i'm sure his voters watch a lot of reality tv but i doubt many of them own stocks 
424 2018-01-10 20:21:42 The "big coins" are starting to be more stable now, which is a good thing. Say goodbye to huge jumps and dips. $btc $ltc $eth should start behaving more like normal stocks now. Big coins for long hold, alt coins for short trades IMO.

429 2018-01-10 20:20:54 #FossilFree NYC follows what began several years ago when Scandinavian sovereign wealth funds divested stocks associated with fossil fuels. For example, utility stocks were sold if their generating plants were fueled by coal in the production of electricity.

432 2018-01-10 20:18:21 I bet you rocked those ‘stocks and socks!! 
433 2018-01-10 20:18:03 So yeah, most of the ones that should at some stage produce revenue are probably overvalued in comparison to equivalent stocks right now and most currencies other than Bitcoin, Litecoin and maybe a small handful of others will die.
434 2018-01-10 20:17:52 I think tullow might be due a drop before pushing on again. Will see how it opens before deciding if it's worth top slicing a bit.

438 2018-01-10 20:16:22 #WednesdayWisdom It’s been more than 100 days since more than five hundred people were killed or wounded by one gunman in Las Vegas, who was using bump stocks.
Republicans have refused to pass any bill that would ban bump stocks.

439 2018-01-10 20:16:21 I’m not sure about the studio, either, however I wouldn’t be surprised if an actor has done something foolish. As I stated before, the movies are made well. I’m sure people are paid not to file suits IF anything has happened. I think Stan owns stocks in the studio, I’m not sure.
440 2018-01-10 20:15:57 No because if you listen to the speech he called for a bump stock ban just prior to that.  There were 3 separate and distinct things he called for RE: guns.  1) ban bump stocks 2) close the so called background check "loophole" on semi-auto rifles 3) a safe storage law.
441 2018-01-10 20:15:34 Better to take a break after 6 consecutive strong trending days.  Focus on ER and story stocks for the next few weeks.

487 2018-01-10 20:01:38 I think he was referring to his ask of the state legislature to ban bump stocks that can make semi-automatic into automatic, just didn't want to get bogged down in the details and he has been saying this for awhile.

500 2018-01-10 19:55:57 I have to assume that when he says Silicon Valley he means VC and private companies, but if he is talking about public Tech Stocks then the statement is even sillier as many Tech names are well below the #Bubble valuations of 2000...  (and have real revenues and profits)

506 2018-01-10 19:54:00 There’s articles about Buffett selling puts as part of a strategy to buy stocks cheaper. Or profit a little even if prices don’t go down. Only works if you have the cash to buy in a down market.

511 2018-01-10 19:50:38 Wow stocks! Not much considering that obama left him a stable steadily improving economy and limited threats for trump deal with. Probably the easiest presidency term to manage in my opinion.
512 2018-01-10 19:50:34 From all-time tights. 

I mean, stocks/sentiment have got extended on the short term to where anything, or nothing at all, can serve as a tripwire. But we're still in the realm of mere noise in terms of credit looking twitchy.

537 2018-01-10 19:42:43 You are extremely quick to decide what I want in gun laws, while you are unwilling to consider if we are safer with bump stocks and assault rifles on our streets. They did not exist when the Constitution was written.
538 2018-01-10 19:41:46 exactly it lacks authenticity
539 2018-01-10 19:41:36 understandable...now can we the people get some of that respect also. you should try addressing the issues that the common folks deal with.The stocks being up is cool but we need more than that.peace #POTUS

624 2018-01-10 19:12:12 It's more important to look at wealth than income. A & S claim that incomes appear to be less equal because corporations are paying executives better instead of reinvesting the profits. But stocks have skyrocketed over the last 35 years! The rich win both ways.

682 2018-01-10 18:52:47 Not gonna be easy to push through that level,may take some time.But I agree with @jfahmy that rates won't impact most stocks until they are MUCH higher.

Higher rates may help most stocks,especially high beta names.

Reits and very interest rate sensitive stuff are an issue.

694 2018-01-10 18:49:09 Stocks can never go down again, rates can never go up again. It’s that simple.
695 2018-01-10 18:49:07 You really have to be out of your mind to be long bonds at these rate levels and credit spreads! If rates stay low, stocks do well. If rates back up, you have a loss. Locking in low rates is not likely to work out very well.
696 2018-01-10 18:48:49 And who said he used Bump Stocks, the media? Please find a single police report that shows what weapons, caliber or accessories used in the shooting, YOU WON'T! All that info is classified by FBI for some reason.

702 2018-01-10 18:46:38 #Volatility being sucked out of the traditional financial assets (stocks, bonds) along with the shrinking capital market system have undoubtedly enticed volatility seeking investors into the #DigitalAsset space.

703 2018-01-10 18:45:58 I got the information from the USA today article I linked. Also from numerous other articles I read at the time. As to bump stocks? No, it does nothing to that argument. He largely used bump stocks. He also had an older machine gun. Two things can be simultaneously true, guy.

707 2018-01-10 18:45:29 Security already exists with the decentralization. No one person can disrupt it. The tokens/coins exist as a currency for the individual company. Not all cryptos are about being a financial market. You invest in the idea and company like stocks.
708 2018-01-10 18:45:16 Not just rates but also stocks. If you naturalize everyone but only after 20 years, there will still be a substantial stock of ineligible people. You don't happen to know a good source of statistics on this topic do you?

750 2018-01-10 18:33:12 You are getting it wrong. No coins or even cryptocurrency is FIAT now. So both are interchangeable. Stocks are not currency - Correct, but coins from ICOs can be used as currency depending on its value in future. That is what i am trying to say.

761 2018-01-10 18:28:23 You said this industry is a bubble but that doesn't make sense. People say that when they don't understand. A bubble is like crypto. Crypto has no potential of making a lot of profits yet their stocks rise like crazy. Weed stocks have real products, real profits and a real market
762 2018-01-10 18:27:25 Most of the time yes, but this gives you the potential to take stocks at early percents which is something diddy normally can't do. Imagine killing a fox or luigi off of a few neutral wins. This is something that makes diddy more consistent and powerful.

799 2018-01-10 18:08:19 think you can buy some EUR/JPY now bonds and stocks both bid...and its come a LONG way
800 2018-01-10 18:08:07 You’ll shoot craps and risk it all, but you’re scared to jump into stocks. I don’t understand because I’m scared of it all .
801 2018-01-10 18:07:51 117 stocks in the S&P 500 are up more than 5% this year.
802 2018-01-10 18:07:17 DeBlasioNew York to sue over energy companies and get rid of fossil fuel stocks in pension funds Mismanagement and broke so go search for deep pockets and screw your pension funding This is almost comical
803 2018-01-10 18:06:52 Low bond yields do NOT prop up stocks.
804 2018-01-10 18:06:46 Think I’m going to buy him some stocks for Valentine’s Day. I’m tired of him window shopping through the stock market 
805 2018-01-10 18:06:36 @ravi_mehata Ravi sir, do you know of any tool which can be used for putting price alerts of stocks n updates n informs in live market... if u r using do kindly share! Thanks n Regards

807 2018-01-10 18:06:10 What a joke, liberal whack job New York sueing oil companies for PHONEY Climate change...LOL. also dropping oil stocks in the retirement portfolios. 
Bet they still buy fuel for heating and driving! Criminal Morons!!
808 2018-01-10 18:05:55 stocks and forex are zero sum
809 2018-01-10 18:04:29 Thanks for clarifying.  I don't trade options, so I don't understand why you would reduce exposure in options but not stocks.  Still so much to learn!
810 2018-01-10 18:04:21 Sir will the msp for cane be rationalized? Eventually debt for sugar mills becomes unsustainable and needs to be absorbed by psu banks. It also skews agri as prices are kept up artificially even though sugar stocks may be massive thus limiting planting of other crops.
811 2018-01-10 18:04:10 Margin long stocks in a bull market!  If they pay taxes on those gains to the US Govt that would be nice.
812 2018-01-10 18:03:56 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
813 2018-01-10 18:03:19 En espérant que cela ne produise pas les mêmes effets que pour le beurre Mr Macron abaissement de nos stocks 172% d’augmentation en 20 mois. Qui doit ont remercier?

815 2018-01-10 18:02:32 $SNV.V ; $SRJ.V big volume on these two stocks
816 2018-01-10 18:01:56 .@realDonaldTrump 4-The true 'witch hunt' are the lies from the republican party against a great man, U know that. The rich think U R great as U cheated the rest of us out of money. Corps R buying back their own stocks! This does not make U great it adds to your assholeness.
817 2018-01-10 18:01:56 Stocks go up & then they go down.  They go down & then they go up.  What do you think is happening right now?  #Cryptocurreny #altcoins
818 2018-01-10 18:01:47 No, activity on the VIX this week a 'nothing burger'. We're barely over 10 folks...we've been locked into a 9.50 - 10.50 range for a while. Anyone think the market's getting frothy? Bond yields will take money out of stocks?
819 2018-01-10 18:01:02 Feeling left out 
820 2018-01-10 18:00:57 $MMJ has to be one of the more overvalued stocks out their. That said I have made money on it and will likely, at a minimum, hold its value until they announce their facilities completion around Jan 26. Can't figure out whats holding $CHV down
821 2018-01-10 18:00:37 Why are the richest people always so wrong about stocks . They can't possibly be lying 
822 2018-01-10 18:00:33 Bro..Stocks are not currency. You can't buy any thing with stocks. You need to convert them into FIAT currency by selling them, they are commodities that hold financial value. Same with tokens or coins. You are confusing Cryptocurrencies with Cryptocoins. Litecoin != XRP or TRX.
823 2018-01-10 18:00:31 That is literally happening here, they’re not profitable several years in. If you think the cultivation stocks will endlessly rise you’re in for a surprise.
824 2018-01-10 18:00:17 Until then the rotation out of bonds could possibly push stocks parabolic.
825 2018-01-10 17:59:35 Crypto is a bubble because they can say they are getting into these coins and their stocks rise a lot but have no profits or way of making any money. With cannabis you have a 20 billion dollar industry by 2020 and it's just getting started. Real products, real profits.
826 2018-01-10 17:59:23 Profits are looking good. One of my stocks just went up by 8.53%. #securethebag
827 2018-01-10 17:58:44 Way to go still !
828 2018-01-10 17:58:43 also took a neat approach to my equities account (stocks) and wrote down my plan of attack last night before bed. 90% executed and holding profits :)
829 2018-01-10 17:58:33 But if rich people don't have all the money, they will starve!  You can't eat stocks and bonds, can you?  Check mate, atheists!
830 2018-01-10 17:57:36 Anyone I've ever touched or worked with in DC stocks go up! People know I don't do average, and I work with the best hidden DC jewels.

Why don’t we use stocks and rotten fruit and veg anymore?

839 2018-01-10 17:54:40 Seriously, a 70% stock price jump is something we are used to in the crypto world, but the traditional stock market? That is something else. I’d be interested to see a list of other stocks with price jumps like that over the past 3d...
840 2018-01-10 17:54:33 You answered your own question. No regulation means buying a pen from grocery store using Amazons stocks. How would that be for an economy? Dangerous. By "True Currency" i meant the same.
841 2018-01-10 17:54:14 Inventages is busy again it seems.
842 2018-01-10 17:53:59 Oh hell supposedly investors would sell rising US stocks convert $ to € and buy Eurozone stocks...so $ would weaken..so said Goldman Sachs :)
843 2018-01-10 17:53:32 Are market cycles growing longer? Do stock markets normally slow down after stocks reach highs? What does a bad year with bonds look like?

849 2018-01-10 17:51:55 The last report they have is horrible, 7 employees, no profits.. you’re better off selling 70% of your stock position (just in case I’m wrong) and use it to day trade nasdaq stocks with reputable companies
850 2018-01-10 17:50:51 I been watching stocks lately.,

853 2018-01-10 17:50:19 Stocks mean you have a stake in the company. The price of stock varies based on the company's performance. ICO's have the same philosophy. Only thing is they are not regulated are open to all crediblity is low because no regulatory body to check its crediblity and track record
854 2018-01-10 17:50:04 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $UAL, $ISRG, $BHF, $CTL, and $M.
855 2018-01-10 17:49:50 They're following Trump's Building Safety agenda. Construction Regulations are governed by the Insurance Industry, not the Federal Government. Trump's heavily invested in Insurance Stocks & Bonds.

864 2018-01-10 17:44:01 Stocks have floated higher off the opening lows as #yields have faded off their highs. Inverse relationship. @GuyAdami spoke of this yesterday on @CNBCFastMoney, discussing how since markets rallied on declining rates, markets will likely sell if rates go higher. #WiseCommentary
865 2018-01-10 17:43:55 @tvcnewsng  Now that @YlanreTVC is back, please can someone make sure Effiong Ekop has an interactive screen to show us how stocks are behaving over a period of 1mnth,3mnths & 6mnths etc

867 2018-01-10 17:41:44 Buffett didint invest in google microsoft nor Amazon and has said he doesnt understand tech stocks , i dont think we care for his opinion just got lucky like anyone else & had very strong hands 
868 2018-01-10 17:41:31 Stay in regular stocks old man.
869 2018-01-10 17:40:41 Valid point. But consider Stocks as a medium to exchange goods and services like currency? That shows altogether a different picture. The thing with any crypto today is there is no solid recognition of what is a true currency. Any token sale can potentially act as one
870 2018-01-10 17:40:17 I'm reading his biography, and the entire first chapter is about him ripping tech stocks before the dotcom crash.. literally zero surprise he doesn't like crypto.. anything you can't value by traditional metrics, he ain't about it

"That's because it can take days for a crypto transaction to complete...."

That’s what crypto is today.

885 2018-01-10 17:36:13 But Zuck doesn't have most of his wealth in dollars. It's in FB stock (and other stocks) which should have the exact same value (in theory) even if everybody starts using crypto's. The same goes for almost everybody else, right?

907 2018-01-10 17:26:55 Increased consumer confidence. Confident ppl buy stocks. Tax cuts to corps means more money for jobs to grow the company. Company growth means rising stock prices bc ppl buy stocks with hopes it goes up

The rest of us take stock in these things. Wish it was fake news, but it's not
917 2018-01-10 17:23:33 I am sure markets are closing green like they did every day in 2018 so far! Its cheap and stocks are under owned and hated right? seriously!

920 2018-01-10 17:22:08 I think you’re making some major assumptions about how the market will behave early in the year and later on the year. The return on stocks is defined by the price you pay for it not really when you bought it
921 2018-01-10 17:21:53 You need to research before you speak. Obama brought us out of a recession to stocks up and unemployment to 4.3. Obama was responsible for our economy thru 10/31/17. This is how it works for all presidents. Research stop watching fox faux news.

924 2018-01-10 17:20:56 I don't know if the ones who jacked the market ate friend or foe.  But you can't just "create value"  ... it actually waters down the value of the dollar.   That trillion gain in stocks is actually a loss in value of each dollar.  basically.
925 2018-01-10 17:20:33 Same here. I came from stocks and quickly learned that Crypto is very very different. There is no sleep. News effects it in weird ways. And 50% swings are very common. Imagine if Google dropped 50% in a day lol. It would destroy the financial institution.
926 2018-01-10 17:20:03 Waiting for lunch in a babythug fried chicken restaurant and the pair across from me have worked blockchain, penny stocks, and legal weed into a single sentence that they continually rephrase and repeat.

928 2018-01-10 17:19:39 It does not cost a fortune to get involved in stocks. You can buy about 6 shares for $1.00. that's cheaper than McDouble. If you compare the cost of adding Mac sauce lol that's like 9-10 shares. Get involved! Great for people with no side hustle.

1070 2018-01-10 16:37:16 @tastytrade @RobinhoodApp Options so much more appealing than buying stocks, the built in limited risk for speculative trades is sooo much better than day trading a stock to avoid downside, took a 2% Win for fear of downside on small portfolio and missed the 10% squeeze
1071 2018-01-10 16:37:15 Look into ETFs. Good way to invest your money and have some level of protection. Also, open a trading account start with a small amount of money and buy the stocks of a few companies you like and are a consumer of. It will add incentive to pay attention and learn new things.

1076 2018-01-10 16:35:51 FYI: How great the stock market is doing doesn't reflect how the average American is doing financially. 80% of stocks are owned by the richest 10% of Americans. Sooooo, these great market values mean shit for the middle class/poor.

1199 2018-01-10 15:55:03 If @WarrenBuffett says stocks are not expensive you can bet he’s looking to sell a bunch of his. He needs buyers. That’s his insider play. Do what he does not what he says to do. #DavidSokol #Lubrizol #BNSF #CSX #EPA #Keystonepipeline

1335 2018-01-10 15:22:57 It's a stock investment app that basically takes ur "change" from debit card transactions and invest it into a portfolio of stocks and you accrue money little by little and learn to invest! It's nice for ppl who don't know how to or too lazy to invest in their own stock

1344 2018-01-10 15:20:25 Ill take your word 4 it but IMO stocks only close gap if people sell (unless its machine selling) The only reason people would sell is because of psychological reasons, such not seeing any developments coming any time soon. A human is not going 2 dump his position 2 "close a gap"

1361 2018-01-10 15:15:56 @BeckyQuick Heard you say didn't quite follow Bill Miller's logic on treasury yields leading to higher stock prices. Yields up, means bond prices down. Means people selling bonds. Selling bonds to buy stocks. That is the logic.

1381 2018-01-10 15:11:23 Stock market prices have nothing to do with jobs.  Stocks are up because corporations are buying back their stock instead of putting those funds into capital investments and hiring workers.  This drives up prices but has nothing to do with jobs or productivity.
1382 2018-01-10 15:11:17 To the extent there's a limit in the market, its how much total disposable assets are available to be put into crypto. However, that $$ will come at the cost of other investments (like stocks or bonds) and not only from other crypto currencies.

1584 2018-01-10 14:07:18 Good stocks follow a 80:20 rule. 80% of time they do not move and in the last 20% they cover up all the territory.  Conviction is tested during 80% of time.  Latest example :  JK Agri Genetics Ltd.
1585 2018-01-10 14:07:07 Buffett: “markets not richly valued relative to rates”....

so Warren would be a seller of stocks under a strong GDP growth environment that results in higher rates?
1586 2018-01-10 14:07:04 nor stocks,junk bonds, etc etc etc...have paper,digital or otherwise a bunch of suits can pass back n forth pretending they have actually created something beside false wealth.
1587 2018-01-10 14:06:01 Cool & hilarious interview this morning on @CNBC with @WarrenBuffett. Hope to be alive and not senile to talk about stocks at age 87, let alone being interviewed about it.

Warren extremely down on #cryptocurrency, said "#Bitcoin will come to bad ending" Oracle has spoken 
1588 2018-01-10 14:05:52 84% of stocks including retirement funds are owned by the top 10%. Record markets don't register with the avg American. They just don't have much of a stake in them. If anything it makes them ask 'then why isn't my life getting better.'
1589 2018-01-10 14:05:01 Why can't UK trawlers do this? When we have our waters back, our fleets restored,our stocks replenished why would the industry not grow?
1590 2018-01-10 14:04:18 If you use stocktwits as a sentiment tool like I do from time to time you realize that the crowd jumps into long $UVXY on every single market wiggle hoping that it will make them 100% in an instant. So maybe the vol products help suppress intermediate corrections. #stocks #VIX
1591 2018-01-10 14:04:09 Buffett on CNBC:  Stocks not richly valued at current interest rates. Berkshire is  a net buyer of equities.  Tax law increases corporate earning power by about 20%.  Bitcoin will have a bad ending, #Buffett

1599 2018-01-10 14:01:27 I'm not shorting #weedstocks #potstocks until after April but only b/c my margin all tied up in swings and broker requires alot of cushion funds to short #OTC stocks.

1610 2018-01-10 13:58:06 After a strong rally the first sign of a deeper correction are large volume price breaks in leading, and usually extended, stocks that just slice through the 10 and 20d MA like a hot knife though butter. So let's wait and see what the day brings. #stocks
1611 2018-01-10 13:58:00 Only 10% of America owns stocks. So you would be right. And the top 1% own 40% of those stocks too. So when stocks do well only they do well, and the profits of companies that raise stocks come at the cost of workers well being.

1632 2018-01-10 13:49:44 sure, there are other ways to participate - buy stocks that use blockchain technology. so in a sense Buffett is already investing into technology through proxy, for example IBM stock. just a though, funny how one bashes crypto space but is invested himself into technology

1968 2018-01-10 10:11:41 I reckon April in agricultural terms was the month furthest away from the harvest when food stocks (for livestock and humans) were lowest and starvation nearest. Lots of fasting going on despite signs of spring growth = cruel.

2070 2018-01-10 08:32:03 Not everyone invests in stocks. Not everyone has a stake in Sensex. It is a wrong barometer of "all-is-well". Interest on savings account, PF Ac matters to most of us and government + @RBI  don't care much about that. @arunjaitley @PMOIndia

2077 2018-01-10 08:24:01 ZIRP/QE has helped drive asset price inflation over the past 8 years (housing/stocks/bonds etc.) which has worsened wealth inequality. None of this is a result of Brexit but might explain why some people voted for it. 3/3

2080 2018-01-10 08:21:34 Plus, the company is still performing well. Cryptocurrencies are not stocks but they are speculative assets that are valued according to future prospects and performance. Ripple is performing well and when big announcements come it will just go up in value again

2345 2018-01-10 05:03:13 I still think #Metals are going to be one of the best trades/opportunities for 2018. Good #commodities to be in if U.S. Dollar finally allows inflation and incase #Stocks or even #Cryptos ever start shaking down. #Gold $GC_F, #Silver $SI_F, #Platinum $PL_F, & Dr. #Copper $HG_F.
2346 2018-01-10 05:02:41 It’s not so much a reference to a character it’s just using @PatrickRothfuss quote that’s on the ring Kerr gave Keyleth. The claws are a personal symbol that somewhat reference to The Earths Children series.
2347 2018-01-10 04:59:40 I found it interesting how $CVX $XOM $XOP all sold off pretty hard into close while oil held recent highs. Then we had the BS report during AH. Wouldn’t be surprised to see oil stocks down in AM and then 10:30 report tomorrow send oil lower as well.
2348 2018-01-10 04:59:28 CryptoVit @vetos777 ... and before the partnership, #QTUM was below $50 but its now at $52.00.

2357 2018-01-10 04:55:57 if you believe there's a 5% chance a given penny stock announces a blockchain pivot that drives stock up 200% (a la $kodk), then an etf of penny stocks should have +10% of expectancy, assuming it's not already priced in
2358 2018-01-10 04:55:57 My brain is borked, I can't metaphor. Which character is this a reference to? Either way that's hardcore though.
2359 2018-01-10 04:55:49 I’m very new to stocks. I’ve read as much as my brain will allow so far and did research. I would like to daytrade but how do you get by not having $25k in your account and not get flagged? Someone help take me under their wing PLEASE! #Daytrader

2362 2018-01-10 04:53:41 700 Million in stocks... My 401K isn't shit compared to that.
2363 2018-01-10 04:53:30 Awesome news if you own stocks and sell before the next crash. If you don't, well, you're just dumb cuz you can't afford them anyway. /sarcasm
2364 2018-01-10 04:53:27 "You do stocks?" "Yeah" "Oh shit so you're like smart huh?"
2365 2018-01-10 04:53:26 It was pretty tough trying to convince ppl to buy stocks that Jan/Feb.
2366 2018-01-10 04:53:17 Client: “The stock market is doing very well under Trump.”

Me, trying not to make a client upset: “That’s good if you own stocks.”

2469 2018-01-10 03:48:17 Some of my family and friends ask me about should they be getting into stocks and mutual funds? My short answer is of course yes! If that doesn’t convince you, I think you should try everything at least once and not put your life savings into it. See if you like it.

2538 2018-01-10 03:15:45 Deep in the money options tend to trade at discount. The mkt is factoring in time lag on conversion of options. When u convert MLSO, by the time mls head stocks hit accounts, price would have moved either way. ie risk.

2595 2018-01-10 02:35:45 businesses are realizing that if they add "blockchain" or "crypto-currency" to their business plans their stocks double in value overnight without having to actually accomplish anything
2596 2018-01-10 02:35:43 How much would it cost to stay out of US stocks for 2-3 years? How does one know what the ultimate risk level is when govt and central bank rescue policy is made at the bottom of the crash?
2597 2018-01-10 02:35:00 Investing direct in these stocks will have one time charge only but with MF, its a recurring year on year

2608 2018-01-10 02:28:40 Environmental issues are also the key thrust of the joint declaration on this area, signed by ASEAN and China, for 2017-2027. A good start, though I think pertinent issues such as IUU fishing in the SCS and decline in fish stocks need to be urgently addressed too.

2619 2018-01-10 02:21:23 Agree but on the real economy. Actually impacting business owners and middle class in a positive way. Less so about inflated stocks and real estate. Obama had no policy just low rates to fuel stocks via Federal Reserve.

2625 2018-01-10 02:18:12 Economic growth for whom??  Certainly not average citizen. GOP proved that with Tax Reform adding trillions of $$ to deficit. That’s no dream that’s a nightmare. Corp profits are sky high already and wealth gap is expanding like Trumps waistline. What % of population own stocks?
2626 2018-01-10 02:17:31 Retail is going to post a big 4Q. Mark my words, these stocks will have a turnaround for 1-2 more quarters:

2629 2018-01-10 02:15:07 For those, who a year ago, said POTUS Trump would end the world, stocks would crash, and so on...has that actually happened? POTUS is doing a pretty good job. And you’d see if the blinders were taken off to see beyond the hatred. Just sayin’
2630 2018-01-10 02:14:35 Yawn! However there could be a serious problem soon if your father backs Amnesty. Then person beware of Stocks & tanking with mass loss of confidence. The two are connected/ yes.
2631 2018-01-10 02:13:54 Some company's stocks move every time their CEO tweets something meaningless while other stocks won't move even if you got out and push.

2642 2018-01-10 02:06:47 Glad to hear that. Why do you call Obama racist? He got the Country out of a recession. Job rate was down, interest was down, stocks were up. All the things Trump brags that he did himself. No it's a continuation of what Obama did. Trump can take some credit for stocks going up.
2643 2018-01-10 02:06:44 You miss something so huge with oil. Nothing is more overbought, and overbullish than US stocks. Oil is cheap, and going much higher rt now. It's a hated mkt, and EVERYONE has been wrong. I remember not too long ago talk of $20, $15 oil was common. #IDIOTS

2645 2018-01-10 02:03:26 My action plan for next 2.5 months

I did the same in 2011-2013-2016... Now doing in 2018 ( Jan 10th)
Conclusion : will review the situation on 31st march.

2648 2018-01-10 02:01:34 You have something I could read about their income to estate value being lower than others? Some estates are all stocks with like 3% dividend yields. Seems like farms would be similar

2659 2018-01-10 01:55:42 The crypto traders use the word crash a lot. I’ve been trading stocks since 2001 and I can say these dips don’t fall under the definition of crash. A crash would mean BTC is worth $1 in a matter of days. I bought more XRP today, the first time I’ve bought over .22

2715 2018-01-10 01:15:26 Stocks l are at record highs as Fusion predicted in the dark days; but,  Fusion also said to avoid bull market death traps that will crush you: Trading..skip the chatlines, thin book secrets, multiple monitor glow.. and avoid timing, big bets, hot tips.. all for Stupids
2716 2018-01-10 01:15:11 Don't be pushed around..they are your stocks..if you are believing the stock you won't worry about the background noises.  $SX is the real deal worth investing time reading everything on them.
2717 2018-01-10 01:14:52 The stocks are mostly trading well above what they really are “worth”. I think at some point they will drop quite dramatically and then start going up again. Hope to ride the wave as long as possible and sell a portion of these at some point.
2718 2018-01-10 01:13:28 What can u buy with it? Would they be used for making option trades on tzero? Can they be used for trading stocks with sieb?
2719 2018-01-10 01:13:01 You think WHSmith should should employ censors to pick and choose which editions it stocks each month?
2720 2018-01-10 01:12:19 Went to my local weed guy and he stopped selling because the profit margin on bump stocks is way better and legal. What is up with hippies these days.

2723 2018-01-10 01:10:18 Oh, I really don't feel sorry for you; you disgust me. You can stop with your ridiculous garbage...you have no basic grasp on reality.
Stocks soaring have nothing to do with you or most Americans. It is not an indication of the economy; they've been on a steady incline for years.

2733 2018-01-10 01:04:03 I’m glad you, daddy, and friends are happy. The majority of the US doesn’t have investments in stocks or bonds outside of a minimal 401k. The rich keep getting richer
2734 2018-01-10 01:04:01 Oil is high, but the actual feeling of being high will come from weed. Speaking of weed, weed stocks are pretty cool apparently

2745 2018-01-10 00:55:23 No, $crypto isn't a solution, it's the vehicle that takes us to the solution - blockchain adopted to meaningful use cases other than currency.

2752 2018-01-10 00:51:18 We don't disagree, its that you conflate asset prices - malibu property, stocks, Vermeers - with what is included in the basket of goods used to calculate CPI. I agree that dumping $ *in the wrong way* has created asset bubbles, but this is not "inflation" - you need a diff term.
2753 2018-01-10 00:50:19 I'm going 6% on Home Depot stocks. I'll see if is noticeable on my check. Or else I'm lowering it lol
2754 2018-01-10 00:49:22 Remember that as prices rise the scope of % moves gets smaller and smaller. So while it can be a popular clichè to say, "the bigger the rise, the harder the fall" I can show you plenty of people still waiting for the big fall in tons of stocks

2776 2018-01-10 00:37:50 Trump is doing a great job! More jobs, stocks are doing great. Finally, countries are starting to respect us once again, unlike how it was under the asswaffle Obama.
2777 2018-01-10 00:36:24 Quite simple, agreement under international law is that a nation gets a proportion of shared stocks that predominantly inhabit its waters. eg. Catch data shows majority N.Sea herring is in UK waters therefore we can rightfully  claim 90% rather than 10.
2778 2018-01-10 00:36:18 Yup, back in late 99 early 2000. When a lot of those dotcom stocks broke down things happened so fast they couldn't get out fast enough. A ton of day traders, many of course trying to buy the dip, disappeared. One of these days rinse & repeat.

These are not stocks. You cannot trade them like I did stocks.  Now I am making money at this.  He swings weeklies.
2826 2018-01-10 00:14:09 Banning bump stocks wont make you safer. If you think it will you do not understand firearms and should either a) learn something about them, or b) exit the conversation.
