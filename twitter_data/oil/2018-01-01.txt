3 2018-01-01 23:59:12 The worst part is that it was apparently oil based, so I couldn't even easily wash it out.

I was late for a date because of that.
4 2018-01-01 23:59:11 Yes but please not just condemning. We need real tangible help. For exampling helping us setting up secure alternative internet connection. boy cutting oil etc.
5 2018-01-01 23:59:03 If you're interested we can ship you and CJ a roller. My gf uses rollers for her back pain before bed. We mix a few drops of essential oil(s) and cocounut oil. For this case it would be applied to the temples and absorbed through the skin. I love diffusing in the bedroom at night
6 2018-01-01 23:58:44 No way.  Screen frequencies, resolution, amateur error, a mess!!! There's a reason optometry is an AMA occupation. Wild west of commerce is selling snake oil once again. Recall the radium cure? Go to the damn doctor put your phone down for this.

17 2018-01-01 23:57:06 Coconut oil is not good except as a conditioner for the hair !
The reason for its popularity is that is cheaper than the healthier olive oil  chosen for  thousands of years in the Mediterranean diet ! !

39 2018-01-01 23:55:51 trump is pushing the unrest in Iran so that he and the Prince of Saudi Arabia can profit from oil, as well as the usual distraction efforts.
40 2018-01-01 23:55:25 Oil jakol is .

Shower time now.
41 2018-01-01 23:55:19 If running the same script produces a specific set of results namely; failed states, black market for everything from organs to oil, refugees, a steady pool of mercenaries for the next target, then it is working as planned, thus why 'Empire is running the same script'.
42 2018-01-01 23:54:30 where is so i use really i am fucking oil
43 2018-01-01 23:54:16 Bough that essential17 hair growth oil. About to try out that hair inversion method this week. My weave will be back next week.
44 2018-01-01 23:54:03 I was lucky enough to see Dale in the Wildboyz stage show - one scene involving a Baywatch outfit and baby oil sticks in my mind! I think there is video evidence on YouTube!
45 2018-01-01 23:53:27 I can't reconcile a Yuan oil peg with mercantilist policies & I don't think China can either. Having said that, they could collapse the $ oil price tomorrow if they cut back oil buying
46 2018-01-01 23:53:01 i think its possible to have too much cbd oil cos i've been using a stronger one but the same amount as normal and tbh i dont feel like i'm even alive rn. super spaced out oopsie
47 2018-01-01 23:52:48 I see how Alaskan Inuit have benefitted from oil & gas development - not just their dev corps but their communities.  Definitely some of their cmty infrastructure (water, roads, schools, etc.) exists b/c of oil & gas revenues to state/Inuit Dev Corps.
48 2018-01-01 23:52:26 Russkies caught selling oil to NoKo?

50 2018-01-01 23:52:08 Oh and by the way, those you see in Gulf of StLawrance are only delivering unethical oil to Quebec and Atlantic Canada
51 2018-01-01 23:52:04 This has been going on for years and the past administration had no concern for it or the angle drilling by Russia & China into oil sites that was denied to our companies.

53 2018-01-01 23:51:43 Drink a lot of extra virgin olive oil... maybe that’d tone down the ‘fucked’ in the term fucked up body clock.
54 2018-01-01 23:51:16 Yes I love coconut oil so much! This is a great deal lol
55 2018-01-01 23:51:03 Oil, Oil, Oil, baby. He's gonna rob Iran blind.
56 2018-01-01 23:50:58 EV market will still be tiny but interest in dying oil market will be weak since the writing will be on the wall for all to see. 

If you win with that outlier, I suspect it will be due to war or big terrorist attack.  Good luck!
57 2018-01-01 23:50:48 We stopped at a full serve station in Mack City, MI 3 years ago. He pumped gas, checked oil, washed windshield. I thought I was in the twilight zone.

59 2018-01-01 23:50:27 Dinner: lentil chili poured over tofu noodles w/ ground turkey meat (93% lean) cooked in sesame oil, spinach, two spoons of greek yogurt, CLA/Carnitine powder + protein shake. 

Reaction: SO. FULL.

Current state: Comatose.
60 2018-01-01 23:50:27 I need some tea tree oil like ASAP.
61 2018-01-01 23:50:26 Tofu scramble: 2 blocks pressed tofu crumbled, 1/2 c. nutri. yeast, onion, garlic, and red bell pepper sautéed in oil, 6 packs of Sazón Goya seasoning. After sautéing the vegs, dump everything else in, mix and cook for 5 mins. Can't #resist
62 2018-01-01 23:50:23 Hue won’t like him, he’s to short. Snake oil salesman will have them take Allen and then we can all cry
63 2018-01-01 23:50:06 Oil rich countries like Norway and Saudi have very large sovereign wealth funds that invest in stocks and shares.
64 2018-01-01 23:49:52 Hopefully Saudi oil will dry up soon.
65 2018-01-01 23:49:41 I need this! I want to start using coconut oil too.
66 2018-01-01 23:49:32 That should be snake oil. Although snake-like isn't inaccurate.
67 2018-01-01 23:49:31 Our country is now owned by “mostly” China ,like most other countries,money madness has the trigger in its hands now and unless something “amazing” happens then this country like all the rest have far more to worry about than water and oil etc,mankind’s ability to stop is gone

69 2018-01-01 23:49:22 It's not a deflection, it's the answer. Andrew is saying that every dollar divested from a foreign company was offset by investment by Canadian companies. Mr. Gotfried is implying money left AB when that's not true. Domestic companies tend to invest more when oil prices are low
70 2018-01-01 23:49:07 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
71 2018-01-01 23:48:40 Take coconut oil 2 T.
72 2018-01-01 23:48:30 Doesn’t have to... but once you make it past the “alcoholic stage” try @badassbeardcare beard oil and bear balm.
73 2018-01-01 23:47:36 Selling Saudies arms is one way to balance the trade deficit in the oil trade.  Brings money back home.
74 2018-01-01 23:47:28 So between, China (they ignore sanctions) NK, Terrorist, non UN members, you think Iraq can't sell oil?
75 2018-01-01 23:47:13 USA are everything except monarchists "Hence their misunderstanding for Russia or even France". If they are interested in restoration of Persian Empire it is purely economic opportunism. Shah Pahlavi sold all Iranian oil to Washington, which is no longer the case since 1980
76 2018-01-01 23:46:17 Yeh and we have got to get rid of oil. A lot of frozen people.
77 2018-01-01 23:46:14 PSA to all my shiny faced ladies: I tried baby powder (corn starch not talc kind) as a setting powder and got no oil at all after makeup! A miracle!! Spreading the good news, hope it works for everyone else too
78 2018-01-01 23:45:47 Does anyone realize oil is @ $55/barrel?$55!When it rose to $100 we were paying 1.40/L. Now it's at $55 and were still paying these prices?& your telling us were in debt as a province?Give me a break.Were is all the Money going from housing sales and cigarette taxes?We pay allot!
79 2018-01-01 23:45:44 first day of 2018
good: threw out some garbage, tidied, cooked, reached out to people, stopped drinking coke
bad: burnt thumb on oil (fine now), feeling social anxiety about trying to talk to someone, battling feelings of worthlessness
80 2018-01-01 23:45:40 Hope your New Year is your best one to date  
81 2018-01-01 23:45:27 Try cooking oil that helped me
82 2018-01-01 23:45:00 Awareness & concern about ice loss by Inuit? You don't say...

I daresay the vast majority of Inuit are more concerned about that ice loss then they are about "doomsday reporting". Unless, of course, they have a personal stake in oil development...
83 2018-01-01 23:44:58 @arunjaitley Sir if govt. unprofitable banks r acquired by other banks, oil sector in oil sector, Power sector to power sector then why not manufacturing sector to bigger manuf. sector because small or loss carrying psu's r not having gud systems. People need rozi roti first

86 2018-01-01 23:44:27 That’d highkey be brilliant or maybe some dog oil spray to soften the fur and make it easier
87 2018-01-01 23:44:24 They did email me back and tell me to use mineral oil, which I clearly stated in my email already hadn't worked.   They didn't seem to read the email, and have not responded when I noted that mineral oil did not work.
88 2018-01-01 23:44:23 It was probably more of a lateral appeasement to their gov’t. China has been pushing hard for a yuan oil peg
89 2018-01-01 23:44:13 The oil wells and platforms and pipeline transfers to tankers should all have to be within sight of Mar-a-lardo...

91 2018-01-01 23:43:39 That's a report in progress. We'll publish it as part of our regular Middle East Crude Oil Exports Report. This time it'll be for entire December. We had AIS outage issues due to rain and humidity in general, but did our very best now to patch the holes in the data.

93 2018-01-01 23:43:15 Sounds correct.  Our refineries use heavy oil feedstock. Even 10% summer grade fuel mixed with the winter stuff causes trouble in this weather.  Every truck has a bottle of antigel in the cab.

97 2018-01-01 23:42:22 @chengevelyn James Altucher is known industry wide as a snake oil salesman at best and a total scam artist at worst.. so why are you giving him any legitimacy at all? If you would like me to introduce you to real industry experts DM me, because that article makes cnbc look bad.

100 2018-01-01 23:41:52 @PetroHome Starting off 2018 without any heat since you can't get an oil delivery to us although we were scheduled today. Called your 24/7 line and despite having 24/7 service was told that you're overbooked and can't come until tomorrow. It's 10 degrees outside!
101 2018-01-01 23:41:41 oh also get some coconut oil!!!!!! a lot of recipes default to olive but especially with vegetables you'd be surprised how good it is to mix it up every so often... broccoli roasted in coconut oil is so so so good

107 2018-01-01 23:40:32 Don't get me wrong, Iran was still able to sell some oil on the black market, but not nearly what they needed to keep their economy afloat. Germany is Iran's key trading partner, which is why the +1 was important in 5+1.
108 2018-01-01 23:40:23 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…

111 2018-01-01 23:40:12 I spilled half a bottle of oil on my stove with the bottle landing on my damn big to.. spreading all over the floor. Shit fucking HURT, I’m all pissed off right now cause ain’t nothing going right I. The kitchen & my husband is completely oblivious to everything because of CoD

115 2018-01-01 23:39:50 Russia is miserable country with a sick bread line economy that its oil resources can't overcome.  Population growth over the last 30 years is zero, and per capita GDP is barely 1/3rd America's.  No wonder Putin is so jealous of us and is pushing for #calexit
116 2018-01-01 23:39:48 Pakistan is an oil rich nation

121 2018-01-01 23:39:23 Like I said, China has been giving oil to NK despite sanctions. So again, what's a piece of paper to anybody with enough to gain?
122 2018-01-01 23:38:40 I wanna go get my oil changed and everything but I always feel like they’ll finesse me cause im a girl lmao
123 2018-01-01 23:38:34 Idk but I wanna put castor oil on them
124 2018-01-01 23:38:26 if he has access to ladybugs (you can buy them in a bag/box, they are used in gardening/flower industry) - he can use them, they will eat almost any pest that may come up on indoor grows.
if not, like suggested - neem oil, or you can make your own mixture using garlic, tobacco...
125 2018-01-01 23:38:23 id enjoy if the refs would see if Oklahoma rubbed oil on themselves. #RoseBowl2018
126 2018-01-01 23:38:16 So we just stopped the flow of oil into NK, who is to say Iran won't sell to them, China still does. We just caught China ignoring sancation
127 2018-01-01 23:38:11 2018 will be a big year for cobolt and lithium mining. Ideally some of that mining will occur in the US as it's the next version of oil. And it will be vital to US security. #electriccars
128 2018-01-01 23:38:09 what about the tradition of citrus juice, niyok oil, & sun?
129 2018-01-01 23:38:01 Oh, I want to add my amateur guess...but it is DAMN hard. Cheaper batteries could push EVs past a tipping point thus the market could drive down oil prices. Or a black swan like N Korea war, Saudi v. Iran war, or a big terrorist attack could push it up. I'll go with $64.57.
130 2018-01-01 23:37:49 Instability partly due to decline in oil prices. Can’t buy off people. #IranProtests
131 2018-01-01 23:37:44 Put a little coconut oil on my scalp and relax
132 2018-01-01 23:37:24 Non-intervention isn't a cult of pacifism either.

Iran isn't blood for oil (Iraq) or guns for al Qaeda (Libya/Syria). This is a nationwide uprising of civilians willing to die to depose the regime. We're not going to war against Iran! Helping Iranian is best for entire world.
133 2018-01-01 23:36:57 They are further along than you know. And they are already manufacturing CBD oil in Texas. The wins are coming
134 2018-01-01 23:36:40 Oil and steak money lol
135 2018-01-01 23:36:29 No I completely disagree with such paid propagandists. Either the donkey does our bidding or we back another donkey.
Cooking repeatedly with snake oil hoping it will turn to Desi Ghee is injurious to health
136 2018-01-01 23:36:23 I know that the primer helps a lot and if you go to sephora they'll help you find a really nice face oil and give you different samples
137 2018-01-01 23:36:18 is diffusing oil like vaping for parents. do other parents make fun of the parents who “diffuse” in their house?
138 2018-01-01 23:35:46 Couple weeks ago oil companies started gouging us at pumps by increasing over 12cents a litre! Better control in gouging would make me happier than crying the sky is falling over a minimal increase due to carbon tax! But, those are the UCP’s buddies!
139 2018-01-01 23:35:43 Like you, I started the year without heat.

Unlike you, it's my own damn fault for being too forgetful to arrange an oil delivery. You know how you can drive for a while when the fuel gauge in your car reads "E"? Home heating oil doesn't work like that.
140 2018-01-01 23:35:37 Last year a video surfaced of a #climatechange campaign that was put together by one of big oil companies in 70s, but squashed it as their profits more important. They have KNOWN for 50 years and actively campaigned AGAINST it #auspol #criminals #corruption
141 2018-01-01 23:35:29 Yes but it was the only work he could find when the oil industry bottomed out he was  on a 12 week away 2 week Home rotation for 8 months then work dried up for us
142 2018-01-01 23:35:20 [well alright.] He texted back as he was getting lathered on oil for the shoot.

145 2018-01-01 23:34:49 After the Deep Water Horizon there was a 24 hr a day video feed of oil gushing into the gulf. There should be a similar feed of the electrical grid in PR on every network till they hit 100% restored!
146 2018-01-01 23:34:42 (: :) I’m going to go have some pho and put coconut oil on my skin
147 2018-01-01 23:34:34 I started painting in oil only last spring. l had used only tempera and watercolors before(besides digital stuff). And you know, oil is amazing.
148 2018-01-01 23:34:06 I also explained to the Ecojustice Board/Org that there is no consensus on oil & gas exploration/development in the arctic amongst northerns/Inuit.  As such, I could not take a position on either side.  Even those that do support it, want to ensure it’s done responsibly.
149 2018-01-01 23:33:59 Searched every Nigerian website for jojoba oil and found it today in Abuja. This God
150 2018-01-01 23:33:41 Yes, we love you for fucking this earth up and just screw the next generation. Why go green whrn you can go black oil who actully kill the earth!

Short strangle in $XOP, somewhat short deltas too. 
Short iron condor in $XRT: flat deltas.

152 2018-01-01 23:33:16 Yes, Venezuela economy was booming because of oil, then the price for oil dropped drastically. Whether Venezuela was a socialist or capitalist society, the economy couldn't survive a crash this large in oil prices.
153 2018-01-01 23:33:05 Trump wants us to be in WWIII. He thinks he can steal oil from anyone fighting us and his friends will make a fortune in defense contracts.
154 2018-01-01 23:32:51 Once upon a time , of course they knew. They care not for slavery. They care only about cheap oil and gas. The End.
155 2018-01-01 23:32:42 Republican president. Won't be 2 years before new boots on the ground in the Middle East and $80 oil.
156 2018-01-01 23:32:37 I think the Arab League are scared, they are losing oil and control and people are starting to realise fast, it was a clever move for Saudi Arabia @KingSalman to allow women to drive, calms tensions for now. Terrorist Sponsers
157 2018-01-01 23:32:31 Being honest! You were there shooting in the gym! Castor oil sisters!
158 2018-01-01 23:32:17 DJ Body Oil.
159 2018-01-01 23:32:10 at one point he asks you for truffle oil and tells you not to ask questions
160 2018-01-01 23:31:52 The cost of flying has nothing to do with regulation. The price of Jet Fuel (oil) is the culprit you are looking for.
161 2018-01-01 23:31:50 tea tree oil was sent from heaven
162 2018-01-01 23:31:36 Can somebody bring me cooking oil pls
163 2018-01-01 23:31:25 Doesn’t it contain palm oil though?
164 2018-01-01 23:31:24 Yeah. Oil companies have a lot of “scientists” on their payroll.
165 2018-01-01 23:31:11 What exactly Mr. Beyer is your standpoint on corporate donations? What have you received from Big oil??
166 2018-01-01 23:31:11 That shit sucked all the juices & oil up outta my body for a lifetime LOL
167 2018-01-01 23:31:09 ofの目的格用法、苦手な人が多いね。discovery of oil「石油の発見」、love of liberty「自由を愛すること」とか。みんなlove of a mother「母の愛」とかrise of the sun「日の出」みたいな主格用法は得意かも。
168 2018-01-01 23:30:44 Yep I never heard of that before you don't use the eggs oil or water just soda any flavor and just let it cook a little longer and use cool whip for icing
169 2018-01-01 23:30:12 OIL DIFF: 6.73 -> 6.83
170 2018-01-01 23:30:01 I entered 2018 with a clean home, the most organized panty drawer I've ever owned and some actual goals. I need a good planner though... And an oil change
171 2018-01-01 23:29:51 The state I live in is like medical marijuana, No cbd oil, No opiates Yes! They are ass backwards compared to the rest of the country
172 2018-01-01 23:29:28 Wait. Tory’s little rat tail is getting fluffier!! And I think he’s getting fluffier in general. Maybe the coconut oil I’ve been feeding him is helping with his fur/skin!
173 2018-01-01 23:28:49 Again only because of the oil money. Kane will win trophies at Spurs.  May not win as many but playing at your boyhood club competing for PL title and FA Cups might just be enough.  Not to mention he stands a good chance of being the all time PL leading scorer when he hangs it up
174 2018-01-01 23:28:47 He is like a carnival barker loudly promoting snake oil to a crowd that is too smart to buy any of it.
175 2018-01-01 23:28:47 Ironically, huge tax cuts are what caused the Depression. That being said, I sincerely hope you're right that these people will bring manufacturing back but much like the oil industry, once the infrastructure is there, they don't wanna change.
176 2018-01-01 23:28:46 @OfficialClarets Stop making me apply oil to my pink ovary. All I want is a little time to work out how to loan Hedgehogs to matalan to make me enjoy skips.
177 2018-01-01 23:28:36 If the texture is fucked up (though oil based should be fine) use a small glass bowl and gently double boil the contents until they're just melted, stir softly and pour into a contact lens case and let set at room temperature. You'll have to use a brush to apply but it'll save it
178 2018-01-01 23:28:29 Anyone calculated what an #oil crisis as in the #seventies would have as impact on #world economy?   And how #fruitful the price spike would be for the #carbon #cabal?
179 2018-01-01 23:28:21 Just finished the batch, but they smell great. I’ll let you know . I slightly altered the recipe...marinated chicken in cashew milk and fried in coconut oil.
180 2018-01-01 23:28:05 Great things like a leaking oil pipeline , opening our National parks to corporations to take the land ? Letting people kill hibernating animals , giving the mega rich tax breaks while giving middle class scraps? Yes there's more but this much sickens me .

183 2018-01-01 23:27:09 I just need some damn oil cartridges
184 2018-01-01 23:26:43 Apparently, no one on this app sells beard oil anymore. It is well
185 2018-01-01 23:26:42 sprayed peppermint oil around my house cause apparently it repels mice and spiders but now I regret it cause I feel like am now living in a BIG POLO
186 2018-01-01 23:26:40 My 8th grader is practically jumping up and down screaming that my mom's potatoes are better than Allie's.   After composing himself he asked for the recipe - basically they are boiled in garlic and then fried in garlic oil.  I'm scared to try his first attempt making these.
187 2018-01-01 23:26:31 Is it not remarkable? Simple oil of cloves, and how amazing the results
188 2018-01-01 23:26:31 No oil or nun 
189 2018-01-01 23:26:30 Also looking to short crude oil and gold miners.
190 2018-01-01 23:26:17 Oil, natural gas, coal, chromium, copper, iron ore, lead, zinc, sulfur, Iran has everything to develop a more than prosperous industry. Many Country would have agreed to have access to those natural resources..
191 2018-01-01 23:26:08 Not so odd if you realize the oily facts of global warming are recognized in the EU; Russia wants to pump its oil via Caspian to MedSea & EU, getting colder as melting Arctic stalls the Atlantic GulfStream.  Montenegro says no; Trump bumps PM at G7.  Then he hustles OBOR profits.
192 2018-01-01 23:25:56 "Willing buyers" is the key here. In 2006, global sanctions against Iran were passed in order to bring Iran to the negotiating table. They were set to expire, as Europe and China wanted their oil. Instead, global sanctions were lifted in exchange for the cessation of enrichment.
193 2018-01-01 23:25:36 Time to Strike First Fast China never quit its Support / North Korea  oil still flows I think we level North Korea , Iran get message to stop its Nuke Program Or it next , time diplomacy is over TIME FOR ACTION MY Opinion 17 years Military Service Desert Shield/Storm  #codeofvets

198 2018-01-01 23:24:34 I love coconut oil.
199 2018-01-01 23:24:28 I have said this before, we must deregulate the oil and gas sector and allow market forces to determine prices of products, initially prices will be high but eventually it will drop cos of competition. I don't know why this is so difficult for our leaders
200 2018-01-01 23:24:27 Days of concessional Saudi oil r long gone. The only thing they give is relaxed payment terms, and force Pak not to import Iranian gas
201 2018-01-01 23:24:20 Georgia leaking oil

205 2018-01-01 23:23:31 Everybody knows from decades...but oil power and profit from weapons selling buy every attempt to stop the Saudis corrupted regime !

208 2018-01-01 23:23:06 Saudi may close the concessional oil tap to Pak too, that can trigger devaluation.
209 2018-01-01 23:22:52 Fry up some garlic oil in garlic and sprinkle some garlic on top with fresh chopped garlic as garlic? ...I mean garnish.
210 2018-01-01 23:22:48 As for Venezuela, they're failing due to the fall in oil prices which is the one commodity that props up their economy. 

And how exactly are they a Socialist country when 70% of the businesses and 90% of the workforce is still in the private sector?
211 2018-01-01 23:22:31 For Kaplan it would be Whitesnake Oil
212 2018-01-01 23:22:27 Oil industry raises the price of car fuel every long weekend, and by much more than the piddly amount the C-tax will cost you.

217 2018-01-01 23:21:29 We need to assess our reliance on plastics, especially the lower grade, lower value uses where recycling is harder to do and more marginal.
There’s going to be a whole lot of oil swilling around soon at rock bottom prices, so there will be a need to intervene!
218 2018-01-01 23:21:28 Resolution: more CBD oil

227 2018-01-01 23:19:12 Me too:)  I think the part of all this i don’t get is there should be more unity with those that were screaming about Bush’s policy issues (oil/Halliburton/ext)when people like me didn’t see it and thought Bush was protecting America-not selling our principles away

238 2018-01-01 23:18:33 When you say “overhaul” but mean “gut to benefit oil companies & drillers like the ones that got 11 people & countless animals, killed.”
239 2018-01-01 23:18:15 I had to change my moms oil in this fucking weather and i get back into the car like “my hands literally hurt they’re so cold” and my sister goes “thats what happens when you become an independent woman” 
240 2018-01-01 23:17:38 Yes, because we can stop them from selling oil to willing buyers.
241 2018-01-01 23:17:24 Where’s the tweet of the naked women covered in oil looking super shiny
242 2018-01-01 23:17:22 can someone invent organic coconut oil that comes in a squeezable tube instead of a jar I will pay big money for this

244 2018-01-01 23:17:13 Or the 5 T of oil I have to fry it in to make it not garbage.
245 2018-01-01 23:17:06 Maybe CNN Fox News and trump could comment on the 23 civilians Saudi Arabia killed today in Yemen. They are causing starvation and death for thousands of people in Yemen and no one in America says a word. Obviously no oil dollars there.
246 2018-01-01 23:17:03 My appartment is freezing, 
This I know,
For my coconut oil tells me so
247 2018-01-01 23:16:59 I have no central heating. I have a small space heater and an oil filled heater (which is awesome, but slow). I can't run them both at the same time on the same circuit b/c my house sucks. Fortunately I have a very long extension cord! Together they keep one room fairly toasty.

- P0.75, kerosene

288 2018-01-01 23:11:06 in 1979, the USA political government helped overthrow the shah, and allowed the Islamic regime under the ayatollahs to come in, all for power and oil money. Since then, it has festered into a colossal ugly mistake. We should make it up to the people of Iran, and support them.

297 2018-01-01 23:09:28 Surely a Province that is based on oil has cheaper gas than my state - based on fish? You are double the price? Why? How?
298 2018-01-01 23:09:23 そうなんですねww
299 2018-01-01 23:09:20 Grrr it’s frustrating to see the Oil play like a peewee league team. Let’s work harder boys!!

309 2018-01-01 23:07:18 They will never do that.  They are replacing coal with renewables.  Gas & oil will continue,,they are married to it.
310 2018-01-01 23:07:13 Well you are way late to that party. 

Where do you think all the anti oil and gas propaganda is financed?

314 2018-01-01 23:06:44 I agree with protests but U.S. regime change initiated under Ike was immoral  because it was patently corrupt — to control foreign country for foreign oil — it went very badly. Middle East & our Jewish ally are still suffering from it.
315 2018-01-01 23:06:42 Update! Got my car unstuck, got oil delivered. Jeans still ripped tho
316 2018-01-01 23:06:41 I an oil baron...  Why would I use something as rough shod as an oil tanker?

317 2018-01-01 23:06:37 If oil is just old Dino bones... why are there fully assembled Dino’s in museums? Why else are ‘dry wells’ shutdown in 70’s full of oil today? Could it be the earth pisses oil?

319 2018-01-01 23:06:33 The tax level in Norway has fluctuated between 40 and 45% of GDP since the 1970s. VAT is 25%. They saved the oil money and taxed the citizens until the pips squeaked to pay the welfare bill.

324 2018-01-01 23:05:46 Fry onions in olive oil, set aside in bowl & fry cod fillets dusted with flour and Cajun Spice (the hotter the  better). Toss in onions when u turn the fish. Good with tongues and cheeks too.

329 2018-01-01 23:05:26 Add oil! Don't put too much pressure on yourself, but it's good to have aims and goals you want to achieve. Remember to take care of yourself too though, physically, mentally and emotionally :)
330 2018-01-01 23:05:05 Venezuela's economy was based oil. Price for oil dropped. The economy collapsed. If their economy was diverse or oil was booming, they'd be fine. If anything, they miscalculated the economics of oil.

333 2018-01-01 23:04:20 If u do moisturize I ALWAYS recommend using coconut oil over bullshit fragrance lotion. All natural, soaks in, DOESNT coat ur face w grease or break u out from the additives. Feels good for the soul (:

335 2018-01-01 23:03:44 And since he said nothing about Russia smuggling oil to North Korea, his support and silence just continues to add evidence to continued collusion.
336 2018-01-01 23:03:30 Dude this fucking looks like oil I'm so goddamn impressed! Keep it up Darkgem!
337 2018-01-01 23:03:24 But she didn't use the oil money to do that - she didn't set up a sovereign wealth fund as Norway did.

352 2018-01-01 23:01:02 How about Russia giving oil to North Korea? Comrade Donnie has nothing to day about that either
353 2018-01-01 23:01:02 Oil was there when nothing else was....now with education and innovation a better option can be offered and consumers will flock to it. 3rd world countries are the worst for dumping in oceans. They should use biomass power generation and lift themselves out of poverty.

363 2018-01-01 22:59:35 Sounds like you are working for an oil and gas lobbying firm instead of a government agency tasked with protecting the environment.
364 2018-01-01 22:59:23 From the kitchen of “I burn things so you don’t have to”, some tips:

If you put your pan on the burner that heats up unexpectedly fast and the oil starts smoking, it’s not too late, just take the pan off the heat and let it cool.
365 2018-01-01 22:58:59 i hadn't screwed around with that year trans surprised to hear its electronic figured would have been mechanic or oil pressure based
366 2018-01-01 22:58:59 Please don't use honorifics (Mr., Sir, etc.) when addressing Trump or Pence.  They are anything but honorable.  They are oil greedy treacherous Russian scum eating rats who don't deserve any admiration or honor in this world.
367 2018-01-01 22:58:56 The evidence is equivocal but it looks like something like 1/2 to 2/3-rds is slated for export. And what’s slated for domestic use will just replace the imported oil that would have been used domestically, so that’s a wash.

432 2018-01-01 22:46:21 I do not know how many Jews or Poles died. I do know if your source is legit. Hitler made it clear what his objective was and I'm in no doubt that 1000s of Jews and Poles died in the hands of the Nazis.

437 2018-01-01 22:45:53 I love putting oil on my feet then putting on fuzzy socks 
438 2018-01-01 22:45:32 U take the oil in da juul and use that shit to cook food

440 2018-01-01 22:45:26 It’s so cold. I gotta mix the lotion with the baby oil and throw on some socks
441 2018-01-01 22:45:12 Every bit of hope I had now is buried deeper than the oil....
442 2018-01-01 22:45:07 NHL...sorry, but not a sports fan so I couldn't care less. Canada shutting the pipelines...ok, we'll just have to bring the oil from Alaska by tankers. Sorry in advance environmentalist nutjobs.
443 2018-01-01 22:45:04 Oil industry thrived with Govt subsidies, now there is an outcry if Govt subsidizes Green energy such as Solar power, wind power.  We have to change this Congress now!
444 2018-01-01 22:45:00 You should pls bury your head in shame. What did @OfficialPDPNig achieve in 16yrs despite the oil boom? Sai BABA comes 2019
445 2018-01-01 22:44:56 Plastic is a product of the oil industry who is obstructing any and all limitations on its ongoing production and they have the power to make sure this massive pollution increases.

450 2018-01-01 22:44:10 Currently sitting in my car waiting for oil to be delivered
451 2018-01-01 22:44:03 Math is funky there. Would be about $600 per year for the EV. 
20K miles with a car that gets 30mpg for gas at $2.50 would be about $1660 in gas alone. Not to mention oil changes and such that the EV wouldn't have.
452 2018-01-01 22:43:12 Oh yes! A familiar feeling! So hard to work out too! If we don’t know what we are anxious about, how do we deal with it!? Someone told me lavender oil helps! xx
453 2018-01-01 22:43:00 Which year was it they predicted $200 oil?  Plus ca change.....
454 2018-01-01 22:42:53 Here in the South in the 50s & 60s, country doctors used castor oil to cure everything from constipation to fever to bacterial infections. Last year, a new doctor arrived in Washington, & he has been administering a purgative to some fevered parasites.

460 2018-01-01 22:42:04 How many of these folks caterwauling about Obama policy are aware that the point of Syria, while US opening the fawcett on fracking for oil, was meant to hammer the Iranian economy down?  Is everybody on this NatSec twitter thing complete partisan hacks or utter Newbs?
461 2018-01-01 22:41:50 Imagine a world where Operation Ajax never occurred and the Iranians were permitted self-determination and the proceeds of their own oil.

464 2018-01-01 22:40:38 3) I hope you feel better by now. I've recently had success fighting a cold by using oil of oregano. I also swear by hot ginger and mineral salt baths to get the circulation moving and sweat out toxins. I'll leave the cold socks alone, tho, thanks.

468 2018-01-01 22:39:33 Come over. I got a gallon of baby oil chillin
469 2018-01-01 22:39:08 But now there might be a regime change that might sell us oil. Big difference in hogging all of America's oil for yourself to fund terror, and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia makes us money, so they get a free pass.

472 2018-01-01 22:38:22 @BkLimegreen is a black-owned company from my hometown, Newburgh NY, that makes multi-candles (candle/massage oil). Many items currently on sale on their site, and all natural ingredients (soy wax, essential oils).
473 2018-01-01 22:38:08 Oh hmm. I'm not the party time. Today saf I chop rice and oil
474 2018-01-01 22:37:11 Me too. 

Diamond crusted (the grinder, not the ring). Had to drench icy water every 20 secs to prevent burns.

Problem was, it was an improvised ring, off an oil rig, made of titanium.

3 hrs of grinding (!) in ED then further 4 in theatre.

Poor bloke
475 2018-01-01 22:36:58 Shit post. Shawn baked sets records on zero carbs. Why are you a carb apologist? Why do you have a vested interest in keeping people eating rice bread pasta and other shit? Can’t wait until you start rallying for more vegetable oil consumption it can’t be far away.
476 2018-01-01 22:36:57 Please evaluate all of our spending both internally and externally and eliminate as much waste as possible.  For example: a 300 million dollar power plant with 9 million dollars of oil, in Afghanistan, which US taxpayers paid for, which is not being used.
477 2018-01-01 22:36:49 Let's go oil
478 2018-01-01 22:36:47 While I may not believe it either, smuggling in oil is no indicator that they don’t have the capacity to launch.
479 2018-01-01 22:36:27 Heya! I've got a similar skin type and I do makeup as a job so I might have a good tip! I've found that makeup wipes with sea salt help quite a bit, and when mixed with a facial oil (scary for oily skin but it can do wonders if it's good) help!! I recommend lavender or rose oil.

481 2018-01-01 22:36:05 Well that's just great until people start getting sick from contaminated water..,not to mention the impact on the environment.  The money won't matter if your dead. Oil is like the horse and buggy. WAKE UP!
482 2018-01-01 22:35:57 I have fought a buldging disk between L4/L5 for a few years now. I recommend turmeric, CBD oil, and daily body weight squats.
483 2018-01-01 22:35:55 Strava sorted. Day one sorted. Covered in oil of a New Years Day night but 2018 should be great craic all the same.
484 2018-01-01 22:35:55 Quite agree . It’s like a holiday brochure where they show you the two good views , but leave the festering oil jetty off
485 2018-01-01 22:35:46 Wide spread situation..seriously i pay for 5000 mile oil changes..only drive 1 of the 4 cars driven daily in our house..how hard is it to look at the sticker on the windshield just up to the left of you & if needed Pull in,,take a seat in the lobby & shoot the breeze for 20 mins.
486 2018-01-01 22:35:42 Lmfao typical man city fans not getting shit. Like not getting any hardware last year BUT WERE AN OIL CLUB AND WERE RELEVANT NOW 
487 2018-01-01 22:35:38 In retort I would say ...One day ...not too far away we'll drive electric cars so won't need oil so then Sheik Mansour won't have a pot to piss in and Man City will disappear back to League 1 in double quick time!

491 2018-01-01 22:34:37 2018 is the year of oil perfumes and the scent of lavender
492 2018-01-01 22:34:32 Furthermore, I'm afraid that N. Korea is a distraction, who was caught supplying N. Korea with oil. Could they (the country which I'm implying) want us to strike near-by Then 'em use self-defense) I recall martial-art teaches patience.
493 2018-01-01 22:34:27 @Jif has fully hydrogenated oil. I thought they banned trans fats? And no @skippy is not better. Skip the hydrogenated oils please.

499 2018-01-01 22:33:57 Danielle, IMO oil demand=US consumer/driver is distracting as labor drives inflation. Both political arguments,not economic causality. People eating drives core oil/energy demand. That’s the danger West faces getting it wrong. China gets it, they upgrade money,we devalue currency
500 2018-01-01 22:33:48 I use to love Evans  hydraulics the blue ones with oil between 2 skins. Old school
501 2018-01-01 22:33:28 I’d gladly give it to you, Tetsu-san. Pero yung skin ko parang di naman fresh puro oil lang hahaha!

504 2018-01-01 22:32:20 The middle east has always been unstable and it has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with corruption, land and power as well as oil. Religion is just an excuse.  Always has been. Considering radicalised Muslims drink, kill and have no regard for the Koran.

508 2018-01-01 22:32:02 Watching #thething. You forget the blatant product placement in those days. Even Chevron got in on the oil drums outside the camp.
509 2018-01-01 22:31:57 so I was showing my dad how my great new essential oil diffuser works and he goes, "you don't put those dabs in that thing do you?" HELLO 2018 you might just be funnier than 2017
510 2018-01-01 22:31:56 Hey Mike, how about we start off by apologizing for the CIA ‘s murder of Mosaddegh in 1953 in order to help BP steal their oil. The Shah (our puppet) created today’s conditions. Mindourownbusiness#
511 2018-01-01 22:31:49 Hope #DawgNation takes @OU_Football DOWN just so @EPAScottPruitt has a crappy first day of 2018... it's the least that can happen for a man who's greedy, science-denying, big oil/coal/chem shill policies are insuring a crappy future for the planet. GO @FootballUGA !!!

517 2018-01-01 22:31:04 IF THERE WAS, a way for oil painting to be as clean as possible, i would have no qualms with painting until my eyes bleed and fall out of their sockets but, it sucks, and i hate mixing paint
518 2018-01-01 22:30:56 Basically defining any certain point within early stage pregancy as when a fetus develops "humanity" is incredibly subjective and problematic, especially when those same people advocating for that want to lower minimum wage or invade another country to take its oil.
519 2018-01-01 22:30:56 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
520 2018-01-01 22:30:36 Yes it is!  My results of lower ldl, triglycerides, andA1C happened when I cut out grains & sugars.  Dr Roizan would have me on a ton of meds from eating corn oil!  #NSNG

522 2018-01-01 22:30:04 Same thing for Raiden network. Complexities can always be hidden behind a good UI. How many ppl change oil in a car. Not many but putting gas in is easy. The focus should be the UI

524 2018-01-01 22:29:39 There are some scientist that don’t agree, out of the 97% of only 77 scientist polled actually believe humans are a main contributor. I guess they are the 74 squeaky wheels that got the oil. I guess we won’t know what caused the warming & cooling trends before 1800’s. Dinosaurs?
525 2018-01-01 22:29:28 What is so stupid . Is that all the people have their heads up their arse.  Israel attacks Syria. Israel stolen land from Syria. Israel stealing oil from Syria.  And that not even starting on Palestine.
526 2018-01-01 22:29:25 Wishful thinking mate...no more oil wars.
527 2018-01-01 22:29:07 After washing, or when it's new, put furniture oil on the inside of it. It forms a barrier and makes it easier to clean next time.  (this works for shower doors. I would think it will be the same for a liner)
528 2018-01-01 22:29:03 Asinine sanctions on Russia spurred Rus' & other countries to take protective measures against globalist blackmail. 1. BRICS & 2. Settlement in oil other than dollars. Illegitimate sanctions on a sovereign nation to bow to others wishes is globalist failed foreign policy.

530 2018-01-01 22:28:47 Empire also funded the NHS, since sustained by petrol and oil. I do see how once-lefties like you love to wallow in old comforts, but what do you suggest going forward then? The Tories will rescue it all somehow?

535 2018-01-01 22:27:26 We do have to end Fossil Fuel use and soon!  
Regretfully the End of Oil may be a long time coming as long as the World's Petroleum Corporations enjoy their protected status world wide.
536 2018-01-01 22:27:13 so sorry for the gross tweets as of late; but the girl I went home with last night has a hairless cat and I couldn't stop thinking about how the same fingers that were inside of me also rub coconut oil on a hairless cat every week
537 2018-01-01 22:27:10 Wash beard every other day so I don’t strip too much of the oils - beard oil right after the shower every day. Exfoliate, wash, moisturize face every day, mask once a week.

541 2018-01-01 22:26:58 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

550 2018-01-01 22:24:59 I switched over to using Burt’s Bees Oil cleanser and it has made a huuuugs difference in calming my hyperpigmentation and made my skin look soft and smooth. It is amazing (for my skin anyways).

552 2018-01-01 22:23:49 My new Shea mix recently cleared the skin around my forehead. Whip shea butter + Vitamin E oil + coconut oil (or any almond?). The only ingredient that’s new is the Vitamin E oil so I’m guessing that’s my new found active ingredient.
553 2018-01-01 22:23:43 I was one of only a handful of financial planners in Australia who picked it. But then I was heavily involved in research on peak oil & kind of stumbled upon predicting the GFC.

Nigeria wake up and enact one...data is the new oil that will never run dry.
570 2018-01-01 22:19:58 Of course we all know the dangers of maintaining a far flung empire while our own country falls apart: of course to me the past 30 years have all been wars for oil.

575 2018-01-01 22:19:00 I have to take my car to get an oil change and I just DO NOT feel like it 
576 2018-01-01 22:18:25 Actually he has not enforced the latest Russian Sanction. In fact he has dismantled the section of the State Dept that was responsible to enforce them. What will he do about Russia & China shipping Oil to N. Korea?
577 2018-01-01 22:18:21 Starting the new year off great, went and got me an oil change

580 2018-01-01 22:17:56 Yo you need an eye cream not a moisturizer! Estée Lauder night repair is a good one. My undereyes gt especially dry in winterI’ll even use it in the day. Or elf is a good eye cream and it’s $4 I believe. If u need extra moisture mix a drop of castor or argan oil
581 2018-01-01 22:17:50 Fracking? Definition? Fracking uses water to extract oil and natural gas from shale plays... in what sense of the word?
582 2018-01-01 22:17:38 What u realy need to do is simply leave them alone . They do not need ur help cuzz we all now american real intrest is oil and destruction of islam .
583 2018-01-01 22:17:37 I want a man that will give me an oil change 
584 2018-01-01 22:17:30 So what’s your point? 
The world is full of hurting people facing hardships.  I’m amazed by people like you who think it’s up to America to right all the wrongs of the entire world. Mexico has enormous oil reserves. Their citizens are only poor because of their crooked government
585 2018-01-01 22:17:18 (the attachments are now all buyable from an NPC. not the oil, unfortunately, but it's much better now.)
586 2018-01-01 22:17:13 Well. My car started this morning but now it won't start. Fuckkkk. The lights, radio, ect. all work so I guess the oil is frozen?
587 2018-01-01 22:17:01 69. Midnight Oil - Beds Are Burning (Diesel and Dust, 1987)
588 2018-01-01 22:17:00 After the coup, and restored to power, the King became much more active, engaging in repression by doing things like banning political parties, this made people upset & so long story short, the revolution in 1979 happened, ending foreign control of Iran's oil.
589 2018-01-01 22:16:43 Flood the market with oil!!!   That will bankrupt Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and every other destabilizing group out there
590 2018-01-01 22:16:39 Americans are everything except monarchists "Hence their misunderstanding for Russia or even France". If they are interested in restoration of Persian Empire it is purely economic opportunism. Shah Pahlavi sold all Iranian oil to Washington, which is no longer the case since 1980

594 2018-01-01 22:15:25 I'm always watching that oil price trigger.
595 2018-01-01 22:15:20 I wrote some tweets but they didn't go through for some reason, but I'll summarize & reach a conclusion.
The Americans agreed to assist British in overthrowing Mossadegh on the condition that US oil corps get some control of Iran's oil
596 2018-01-01 22:15:13 Not to be that bitch but I've started to exfoliate with aroma therapy oil while listening to fleetwood Mac and I feel like a new human
597 2018-01-01 22:15:06 remember when oil sykes' bit came on in bite your tongue and everyone pretended to be a scream vocalist for 30 seconds
598 2018-01-01 22:14:59 @EdmOilKings LOVE LOVE LOVE the new look! I am now an oil kings fan! Go OilKings!!
599 2018-01-01 22:14:22 It is called the truth and I'm sure you have already boycotted it in your blind, misguided support of Trump.  It's time to open your mind, improve your education, fairly consider all sides of the argument.  Consider the reasons why Trump wants a war with Iran, e.g. oil, money.
600 2018-01-01 22:14:17 I got new hair oil today and a Anastasia lipstick:)

604 2018-01-01 22:13:13 You know and I know it’s about $$$$ for oil. Green energy entrepreneurs, citizens, environment be damned.
605 2018-01-01 22:13:11 A mess in more ways than one. Somebody introduce him to beard oil. Gross.
606 2018-01-01 22:13:11 I did the oil. Was disappointed, autoimmune degenerative joint & arthritis not helped one bit. Will look into ipuff, thank you!

608 2018-01-01 22:13:01 As a person that worked in the oil industry for 25yrs Global warming is the biggest lie ever told to ppl. From beginning to the end all lies just away to create a bullshit tax called "carbon tax "
609 2018-01-01 22:12:59 If climate change is so real,why aren't the people preaching it,not living it? No rain containment systems,no solar power,no cars that drive on vegetable oil,no jets. Bc it's all BS,the earth has always changed before cars,buildings,phones,it's what it does.
610 2018-01-01 22:12:39 No just cellulite but i use mederma oil for stretch marks

618 2018-01-01 22:11:43 Always Nethaniy around to pour oil on fire. He should keep out of this story, not his business. He's a murderer far worse than iranian rulers
619 2018-01-01 22:11:38 Shit like apricot and avocado oil are pure and probably the best. My face hasn't aged since I was 17 lmao only difference is facial hair

621 2018-01-01 22:11:03 Sana minahin na ng Pilipinas ang oil & gas sa WPS para mabawasan ang pag import ng gasolina
Matagal nang ibinaba ang hatol ng Korte laban sa pagpapawala ng karapatan ng China sa ating EEZ. Ang kailangan na lang gawin ng PH ay maglagay ng oil platform tulad ng ginawa sa Malampaya

635 2018-01-01 22:08:50 They have to run the nation, we had some weakness cuz we r depended oil from M countries nd they r buying our missiles, but that doesn't D end if our relationship with israel, remember when modiji visited israel pm Netanyahu said "our relationship made in heaven"1/2
636 2018-01-01 22:08:46 Mostly coconut oil, with a bit of lavender, in a Pink Ladies dispenser, is my 2018 New Year's Rizzo Lotion.
637 2018-01-01 22:08:19 History repeats. US intervened at more occassions like Chili, Nicaragua, etc  Intervention Iran 1950's was after Mossadegh took back oil production which would get Iranians a fairer price for their oil

640 2018-01-01 22:07:50 That cannot be tolerated. All governments need to bow before the alter of big oil. Otherwise one or more of them will start growing spines too...
641 2018-01-01 22:07:48 Mes vergetures dû à mes crises de boulimie sont enfin en train de blanchir après deux ans d’application de bi oil matin et soir. Je suis joie. 
642 2018-01-01 22:07:05 @Brnin33 today might end up being my least healthy day of 2018. Hefty amount of non non-alcoholic drinks and a legit pound of meat fried in oil and salt #noragrats
643 2018-01-01 22:06:57 Luckily the deal has both carrot and stick. We've made then decide between selling oil and making nukes. They've decided to sell oil.

You'd prefer they make nukes, apparently. And then bomb them into submission somehow?
644 2018-01-01 22:06:36 I should know better than to get involved in the legalize pot argument. Pot heads come out of the wood work w/same tired arguments I've heard for over 40 years. To hear them tell it, they sound like the snake oil salesmen of the 1800's.
645 2018-01-01 22:06:32 It's always about the oil, man.

649 2018-01-01 22:05:35 Unfrankin believable! I heard frankincense oil had medicinal properties but i had no idea it is so powerful. Thx for the info @HealthRanger
650 2018-01-01 22:05:32 Thank you and Happy New Year to all.  I followback all Patriots/Trump Supporters 
651 2018-01-01 22:05:13 A dumb article, even by standards of @lawrence_wright...
Texas economy had NO bubble when oil hit highs prior to 2008 & after 2012
Texas had NO real estate collapse, despite oil collapsing twice in a decade.
And Medical Center Houston is poised to overtake Downtown in size!
652 2018-01-01 22:05:06 Fijate bien porque hay un eucalyptus oil para aromaterapia, ese no es. Es el de aplicar a la piel.
653 2018-01-01 22:04:59 I wish the vow to punish oil marketers is an actual intent from Buhari; alias it is one of those written speeches. All he did basically is recitation of a script, don’t be carried away. The words of Buhari are void of actions!! #FuelScarcity
654 2018-01-01 22:04:51 Take ur oil taylor take ur fkn oil
655 2018-01-01 22:04:40 That itself is a problem and stupid as shit. You wan't america separate from the world? First give  back penicillin, amoxicillin, about 85% of your bottled water, NHL players Canadian and European, then let can shunt the oil pipe lines
656 2018-01-01 22:04:25 Warm oil massage
657 2018-01-01 22:04:18 Just another excuse....exactly like the fiasco with oil companies who are now ripping us off at the pumps!!
658 2018-01-01 22:04:14 Squeaky wheel gets the oil. There are plenty of people who appreciate your contribution to academics yet don't say much. Don't let the noisy few bother you!
659 2018-01-01 22:04:04 And meanwhile Russian tankers supply oil to North Korea and not a word from the White House.
660 2018-01-01 22:03:51 Hmm, need a lil more pan oil and heat, but a lot better then mine would've came out
661 2018-01-01 22:03:42 complete flush is definitely worth it dude, prevents further issues, and when you drain the oil make sure to get it checked for flakes/filings you'll know the health of your clutch too then
662 2018-01-01 22:03:36 Very interesting..Hard to see anything coming out of this but when the 1979 Revolution started they did shut down the oil industry and prices spiked.
663 2018-01-01 22:03:28 Hope @OU_Football goes down just to make @EPAScottPruitt feel miserable. If they win, I'll be happy for the players, but greedy, science-denying, planet killing, big oil/coal/chem shill Scott Pruitt deserves a bad day as his first of 2018. #PlanetBeforeProfit

675 2018-01-01 22:02:18 For instance, I will not admit that UGA may be overrated, but I will admit that Oklahoma is a small, oil rich state run by fundamentalists
676 2018-01-01 22:02:16 It occurred to me too that it wasn't that long ago we were all "OMG a gov with the balls to hold foreign oil execs accountable". That can be fixed with a cooperative/obedient regime. The less levers the better.

680 2018-01-01 22:01:52 Heres hoping that adding some transmission oil fixes the issue. Though I might consider a complete flush of the oil and add new.
681 2018-01-01 22:01:31 Is another major factor that affects price. Liberate the PMS market the same way it is for ATK and AGO. Give out more licenses for private companies to establish refineries and lets refine locally our crude oil and see if these issues won't be forgotten
682 2018-01-01 22:01:23 I hope the coconut oil in my hair doesn’t harden when I go outside 
683 2018-01-01 22:01:05 What Trump and the GOP have done is made many Americans forget it was the GOP that got us into the recession that put 8.7 million Americans out of work, and it was Obama who steered us out. Saved the banks, rescued the auto industry, made us a power in the oil market...
684 2018-01-01 22:01:04 I crashed your car but the oil needed to be changed anyway.

689 2018-01-01 22:00:25 I hate that olive oil is almost always sold in tall, skinny bottles. The shelves of the pantry where our oils are kept don't have much clearance. You say first-world problem; I say conspiracy.

693 2018-01-01 22:00:02 Might just be that my truck is low on transmission oil. Just checked it and its super low. I would be beyond happy if its just that.
694 2018-01-01 21:59:45 Use it with ori or pears baby oil 
Thank me later
695 2018-01-01 21:59:40 I’ll try this thankyou  I have run out of olive oil so will re stock on some tomorrow. I’m so close to shaving it Uno 
696 2018-01-01 21:59:16 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.

705 2018-01-01 21:57:09 As others have said, sweet almond oil. I use olive oil with a few drops of tea tree oil. It gets me right together.
706 2018-01-01 21:57:06 In 1951, the Shah appointed Mossadegh as the Prime minister of Iran, and the first thing he (and the Majlis) did was begin defying the British & declaring Iranian oil to be for Iran only, not the British. This led to the British forming a blockade of the Persian Gulf
707 2018-01-01 21:56:44 why oil or butter?
708 2018-01-01 21:56:40 I found something called Humco Sweet Oil and I also found Olive Oil works. You can find directions online.
709 2018-01-01 21:56:18 How many ppl join up just for a job? In Africa young boys ; kidnapped. 'New conscripts' . 
If Saudi had not oil nobody would look twice at them.

710 2018-01-01 21:56:10 Info tech is becoming the new oil, and I'm one of the few that know a little about it in this cesspool of a country.

I love what I do and I'm growing rapidly, meeting great people every other month.

I've basically found my wife and that's going great.

Why ruin any of this now?
711 2018-01-01 21:56:02 Same people were likely all doom and gloom about crude oil also. What’s your 2018 prediction?
712 2018-01-01 21:56:00 Oh, it works. You can hear it cleaning house, too. I love warm oil
713 2018-01-01 21:55:45 Need to invest in some good beard oil.

716 2018-01-01 21:54:33 'Health & Safety is common sense' but when an experienced kitchen worker is prepared to carry cooking oil at 131°C you have to ask 'does common sense still exist?'

718 2018-01-01 21:54:13 What i did one time was rinse my hair with olive oil mixed with castor oil after my shampoo and conditionning, then rinse the oil out with water and my hair was soooooooo smooth afterwards(but its messy and im lazy so i dont do it no more)

720 2018-01-01 21:53:49 The National Front was a loose organization of liberals, conservatives, socialists, communists, nationalists, and Islamists who all wanted 1 thing: the end of British control of Iran's oil.

722 2018-01-01 21:53:37 He’s skimping on everything except for big war/oil contracts to his buddies, tax cuts to his billionaire alikes, and to fund his vacations and secret service for his far flung family
723 2018-01-01 21:53:35 Like oil and water?
724 2018-01-01 21:53:31 Almond oil
725 2018-01-01 21:53:26 I need to check my oil and put air in my tyres but I have no idea how
726 2018-01-01 21:53:16 I am pretty sure the garage in Sandhurst sells heating oil which you can collect - probably too late now but maybe bear in mind for the future! We can also install watchman tank level monitor alarms 
727 2018-01-01 21:53:06 For ego, read oil.
728 2018-01-01 21:52:38 Could be sweet almond oil

730 2018-01-01 21:52:09 I don't think his denial of Climate Change is profit driven. I think its pure stupidity. Big Oil doesn't have to bribe him. He is just that stupid.
731 2018-01-01 21:52:06 USA are everything except monarchists "Hence their misunderstanding for Russia or even France". If they are interested in restoration of Persian Empire it is purely economic opportunism. Shah Pahlavi sold all Iranian oil to Washington, which is no longer the case since 1980

740 2018-01-01 21:51:20 New Years Day adventure. Mom's car wouldn't start and oil pressure light was on. I hadn't checked or poured oil in a car since high school, but I did it today.
741 2018-01-01 21:51:00 Ah yes, good old hydrocortisone.  Perhaps you need a stronger dosage.  The clinic would give my nephew basic aqueous cream to wash with, and then emulsifying cream (oil based moisturiser) to moisturise the affected areas.

But yeah, best to chat to your GP about further options.
742 2018-01-01 21:50:55 Put Auburn and Michigan in their own conference.   Both programs are paying elite money for snake oil salesmen.
743 2018-01-01 21:50:34 And in same vein, keen amateur fisherman told me fish should only be cooked in sunflower or peanut oil, never olive oil, due to different boiling temperature of oils.

757 2018-01-01 21:47:20 Iranian opposition forces call for general strike tomorrow. This could cripple oil production $CL_F

759 2018-01-01 21:47:06 When those subsidies are granted to the oil companies, are ALL tax payers given stake in said oil company? Your answer to that question will also be the answer to whether or not the oil industry is a socialist endeavour.
760 2018-01-01 21:47:05 they're so easy! 
-break up the kale into pieces (not too small as they shrink!) 
-put a bit of oil & salt on them and then pop in the oven! SO GOOD!

767 2018-01-01 21:46:24 #POWRtoken are a reputable outfit from Perth Australia - no way would they lower themselves to pay a modern day snake oil salesman. No way.
768 2018-01-01 21:46:11 I’ve read that lotions and body butter really don’t prevent anything. Exfoliating to increase blood flow and oils like pure coconut oil are the best supposedly 
769 2018-01-01 21:46:11 Oil prices are going up everywhere Sir...
770 2018-01-01 21:46:09 can’t believe i’m coming into college tomorrow looking like i’ve dived into a vat of oil because i Accidentally put body butter in my bath
771 2018-01-01 21:45:54 I love jojoba oil in my hair. It’s all soft instead of frizzy
772 2018-01-01 21:45:48 If they're not even mentally prepared to play the game...nothing else is even possible to measure. Nevermind relevant. It would be like me inspecting tyres & engine components on race a race car prior to a race...but...nobody can even remember where the car keys are.........
773 2018-01-01 21:45:18 Coconut oil will solve all my problems in 2018.
774 2018-01-01 21:44:53 I'm more offended by his disregard for indigenous people, his neoliberals economic policy, and his continuing to bow to the wishes of oil companies. But you worry about how offensive his shirt is, I'm sure it's very important.
775 2018-01-01 21:44:52 The British and the Russians invaded Iran to deny the Nazis access to Iranian oil. After ww2 ended, they forced Reza Khan to abdicate, and Muhammad Reza Pahlavi became the new king of Iran.
776 2018-01-01 21:44:49 Why did the West ever teach them how to take the oil out of the ground?!?
777 2018-01-01 21:44:45 Coconut oil irritates the HECK out of my scalp. I use olive oil instead. I also blow dry my hair in the winter time and do protective styles. Raw Shea butter, shea moisture products, and olive oil. Make sure when you do a protective style it’s not too much stress on your hair.
778 2018-01-01 21:44:42 Be careful! It gets hot quick. Don’t leave it unattended. When you’ve finished with it, always cool it down by adding more oil/fat into the pan. Always keep the lid on it. Seriously, they are lethal!
779 2018-01-01 21:44:34 I have spent all day sipping coffee with an oil diffuser and humidifier blasting. Happy 2018

782 2018-01-01 21:44:17 you look like an oil painting how is this possible
783 2018-01-01 21:43:45 Mhhh and who did 9/11? Iraq? Check the nationalities, and who is the biggest US oil partner. You are incoherent, so is your government. And yes it's some 3months elected guy's fault, not this:
784 2018-01-01 21:43:40 the fact that Matt covered me in half a bottle of bloody baby oil in my work uniform before I finished work is still pissing me off now. I'm actually gonna ruin his life swear! #WatchYourBackPal 
785 2018-01-01 21:43:36 Fox news lies again: democrats are right of center, aren't leftists. Leftists are against permanent war, big oil, big banks, the surveillance state, militarized police, income inequality, fracking, GMOs, arms dealing, all things democrats are for.
786 2018-01-01 21:43:27 You’re right. I guess I’ve always added oil to cold pan without thinking to better control it.
787 2018-01-01 21:43:27 Mou buys no one. ALL homegrown. City ruins football! Arab oil money! Man United built from ground up! The Special One! 

Let go of the narrative. It's a often failed one. Have good day...
788 2018-01-01 21:43:09 There is no fair oil under late capitalism
789 2018-01-01 21:43:09 Americans are everything except monarchists 'Hence their misunderstanding of Russia'. If they are interested in restoration of Persian Empire it is purely economic opportunism. Shah Pahlavi sold all Iranian oil to Washington, which is no longer the case since 1980
790 2018-01-01 21:42:50 BTW Tsim, Currently our economy does not depend entirely on oil ! Just for 30%. So be careful before tweeting about my Country. "Mafi oil" !
791 2018-01-01 21:42:48 .@RealMarkLatham 

You "stop the boats" by "stopping the various 'wars on ... (insert drugs, religion, oil, etc)'".

Solution, end problem.

793 2018-01-01 21:42:27 As was just said. Our oil industry is exceedingly “ clean” relative to peer production countries. We have been doing something, well.
Let the others catch up for a while
794 2018-01-01 21:42:26 Chest pains do not mean that it's your heart. It could be asthma maybe or something totally off the wall. My point is that there are far worse things for your heart. If you use cannabis oil you would not have the issue you do with the smoke obviously.

799 2018-01-01 21:41:28 Haha it just can happen if your pan is like 800 degrees and you drop oil that ignites at 500. Why it’s best to let it warm up in pan
800 2018-01-01 21:41:25 I have had a knot in the back of my head for like 3 days now and i can't get it out so I asked my mom to help me brush it out when she gets home nd she told me, " cut that horse hair already, you have 2 big of a mane "... i almost this fucking coconut oil at her over the phone!

807 2018-01-01 21:39:21 The fact that the oil companies jack up prices for the holiday break and then bring them down again after the 1st of January kills yours. For example if Fildebrandt had waited a mere 4 days he would have saved 5c/L over the price he paid, even with the tax last year.

819 2018-01-01 21:38:00 Oh yea. If you add it to hot pan it’ll ignite haha. Still the best thing to sear with though. I don’t ever take my pan past 6 on the stove. Try that. Add oil, when it starts smoking you sear

837 2018-01-01 21:35:57 If you are in the military, you are contributing to the greater effort of killing people for oil. You are part of the military complex, even if you’re not pulling the trigger. 
Just like if you were in WWII, even a cook helped defeat Hitler.

853 2018-01-01 21:33:29 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
854 2018-01-01 21:33:29 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
855 2018-01-01 21:33:11 Why? Tucker made a bad choice. It happens. He was sold snake oil by a master but JT was blind as a bat. He will wind up somewhere else and be okay. He’s shown immaturity in a number of instances. This was all very unsurprising. He does have a chance to write the end to the story.

858 2018-01-01 21:33:00 I dont have to depend on BJP provided data to believe on inflation and Make in India bullshits. I am paying a hefty fee for railways but donot get proper service. Oil prices are way up when intl prices are down. Bank FD rates down. Need I say more?

873 2018-01-01 21:30:13 I think Hillary Clinton did her best to win the election. Few Europeans gave Donald Trump a chance. Some of her campaign leaders might have leaked information to Trump who certainly was backed by gas, oil and coal companies.
874 2018-01-01 21:30:09 @DrOz if the saturated fat from coconut oil is some of the only saturated fat you get as a vegan or vegetarian then it is not bad to eat coconut oil. To compare plant fat to something as nasty as Lard pork fat is outrageous

886 2018-01-01 21:28:11 I am from the Caribbean where coconut oil has been forever used by locals. It is a sustained practice in Trinidad to only use coconut oil on the scalp. It is never ingested or used in cooking. As a result I find the recent findings on its ingestion to be quite interesting.

895 2018-01-01 21:26:45 I leave my jar sitting on the radiator so that the oil is always in liquid form, then I use about a teaspoon's
896 2018-01-01 21:26:41 If one understands this pre-1964 dimes v. post-1964 dimes cost of gasoline metaphor, then what China & Russia have been doing with gold should become more obvious.  China needs cheap oil.  Means they can either find more oil or pay in a better currency.
897 2018-01-01 21:26:31 Thanks, the oil generation mix looks very large. In more general terms I think it is very interesting how transmission grid expansions will take place in the US and your episode on the legal side of grids indicate that in some cases it will be easier to set up storage than grid

Deplorable
901 2018-01-01 21:25:39 How much coconut oil do you put on?  I just have a jar from Trader Joe’s so it’s nothing special!
902 2018-01-01 21:25:20 Not at all. At $81/bbl Brent (say, $78 WTI) tight oil should be booming! And let's not forget that demand stayed quite strong with WTI over $100.

904 2018-01-01 21:24:49 The Alberta Advantage was a myth for most. Oil prices rose world wide and the government in power had access to the trough.

You know perfectly well that after the oil is gone, sand is not edible, so the only thing to make money in the Gulf countries will be TOURISM: force other people to convert to Islam and get a free ticket to Mecca.
Good luck fighting against all these Powers.

Your segment on coconut is industry oriented not health aware
941 2018-01-01 21:19:07 We understand. But words, not action, is all we get from government on climate change. Please do something. On a related matter, houses in the countryside are burning oil for heating: a crisis looms when oil supply dries up or falters. People need to switch to renews or insulate.

944 2018-01-01 21:18:31 I wonder how long it will be before they get it straightened out.  That letter is 9 months old.  We may run out of oil first, as slow as the government is.

949 2018-01-01 21:17:54 It's less the cost in money, than the costs in energy, burnt oil, etc. transport fuels, melting energy. It's as much a harm environmentally or just a variation of the harm, as of plastic. Just not on environment area quite as simple as change from the 'bad' plastic to good glass.
950 2018-01-01 21:17:51 Elizabeth your a good and brave woman these others don't give a shit about their grandchildren since they'll be potting soil anyway see they figure there's more money burning oil and less cost straight out selfish!!!

953 2018-01-01 21:17:18 I could've done the same (silly, abhorrent, smug, elitist, disgusting) but that's a diversionary tact used by folks who have nothing substantive to say.
And since there's nothing positive to be achieved from this, good night.

955 2018-01-01 21:17:07 China is transferring oil to NK ships (as well as the Russians) on the high seas. ISIS moved to Yemen and Nigeria (that is why U.S. troops have moved there in silence) and the economy is doing well. I am not too sure his insults are tactical. I cannot see their point.

America’s policedog in the Middle East SaudiArabia runs out of oil. So Syria was targetted for oil grab but that failed. Next was Yemen for its oil reserves and Saudis want it all. Even Iran oil in the Gulf.

993 2018-01-01 21:12:25 translation; Iran has oil and resources our masters would like to get their hands on.
994 2018-01-01 21:12:22 It may be our savings account...we along with entire world switching to solar and renewable energy..once dependence on oil gone religious terrorism gone... religious terrorism gone means population groth gone next we will cross China within no time.
995 2018-01-01 21:12:16 Bonne année Pascal.
996 2018-01-01 21:12:07 I do know a little something about that grid...mainly, that they only fire up those oil generators during periods of extreme weather-driven demand (like now). Most of the time, oil-based generation is near zero.
997 2018-01-01 21:12:06 Coconut oil treatment on hair, face mask on 
998 2018-01-01 21:12:02 I feel like a lil witch when I’m mixin all my essential oil potions together in my diffuser lol

1004 2018-01-01 21:10:38 I want to be oil painted.

1006 2018-01-01 21:10:27 Wonder what would happen if Russia were to invade Norway??? Wonder how come millions of people dont flee to Norway? Without its "evil" oil reserves, could Norway sustain its model??? Your juvenile metrics and understanding are hilarious...

1010 2018-01-01 21:09:46 Good.  Let the entire oil

1015 2018-01-01 21:08:34 I read it wrong initially; guess it was wishful thinking. Thank you.
1016 2018-01-01 21:08:25 you have to check the oil if its that loud

1019 2018-01-01 21:08:01 my car sucks. my front right speaker out, it need a oil change, it need brake pads changed ugh
1020 2018-01-01 21:07:31 Vaseline and vitamin e oil
1021 2018-01-01 21:07:26 I agree and it is sad. Only correction I would make is with your wording "their government." A better description would be "their unelected and illegitimate rulers who imprison, torture and kill them (and steal the country's oil wealth)"  #IranProtests
1022 2018-01-01 21:07:24 Texas and Louisiana sustained enormous hits from a succession of storms in past years, but the oil and natural gas flows continue safely.  This fact bodes well for safely siting an LNG export terminal near Coos Bay.
1023 2018-01-01 21:07:08 Beanie on,tea in my cup, James Arthur on repeat, peppermint oil in my diffuser, & 2018 mood board sesh in full swing. Hello 2018 
1024 2018-01-01 21:06:48 You want their oil! New war coming???
1025 2018-01-01 21:06:45 Dr. Oz is on at the gym and they are talking shit about coconut oil. I'm not down with that.
1026 2018-01-01 21:06:37 No no nooo, it's bcos she said she wants BP stans and BP is an oil company lol
1027 2018-01-01 21:06:25 does wild growth oil really work?
1028 2018-01-01 21:06:15 Over this festive period, I have baked so much, I have used nearly 3kg of flour, similar of sugar, an entire 907g tin of syrup and c. 1kg of butter/oil. I am not baking for a long time now...
1029 2018-01-01 21:06:12 I am a mess since I ran out of #CBD oil. Current coping strategy is to consume vast amounts all other vectors of #MedicalCannabis, bender watch something on #Netflix
Suggestions?
1030 2018-01-01 21:05:59 "very early oil spill" /bumblebee leave him alone he is so talented/
1031 2018-01-01 21:05:46 Now that the Mother of All Oil Magnates is at the head of the EPA, can we start to discuss climate change rationally and stop making it a partisan thing?
1032 2018-01-01 21:05:31 @EventDrivenMgr I am also wondering if CITO also lobbies to keep the gas pipelines away... would ruin PDVSA if they lost the NE heating oil mkt.
1033 2018-01-01 21:05:30 I wanna see you both in an oil scene but I don't know if I'd be able to see the squirt through all the oil?  But you never know until you try!
1034 2018-01-01 21:05:24 You're a hypocrite and just interested in their oil, so cut the crap as you gut healthcare, meals on wheels, CHIP, for poor, elderly & children Condemn peaceful protest, deregulation of all that protect us, environment, animals and economy while you & corrupt greed mongers profit
1035 2018-01-01 21:05:20 NEW YEAR'S TEARS are a real thing that I’m gonna bottle and mix with some kind of essential oil and wax to turn into a candle to burn the next NYE and vow to hopefully not cry over the same thing next year.
1036 2018-01-01 21:05:05 You can tell the size of an oil co. just by its tweets. If they're about smelling flowers and hugging trees, you have a major oil co.
1037 2018-01-01 21:05:02 how tf can people go several days without washing their hair like if i go more than 24 hours without shampoo i look like a victim of the 2010 Gulf oil spill
1038 2018-01-01 21:05:00 I'm obviously the bear of the group. For 2018, I expect 1) growth in shale, 2) rapid growth in EVs, 3) an oil price spike in 1st half of 2018, followed by 4) major global economic headwinds that destroys demand.
1039 2018-01-01 21:04:58 2017 iran sold 777 million of oil and 150 million of Oil products !
1040 2018-01-01 21:04:58 Transit is a public good, so people who expect services to "pay for themselves" ignore how we subsidize oil, roads, corn, all these host of industries...not that they need it, but for something like public transit, better figure of merit would be spending on similar good/utility
1041 2018-01-01 21:04:15 The castor oil was the punishment...the diarrhea was just a side effect
1042 2018-01-01 21:04:07 Looting of oil is his 1at priority not democracy. In DRC d President's term is finished but he is still President. USA is quiet because American oil companies are controlling minerals. Democracy is the last thing America and @potus cares about. #Hands of Iran
1043 2018-01-01 21:04:00 He was in Phoenix
1044 2018-01-01 21:03:43 put some oil on it bae lol
1045 2018-01-01 21:03:41 Triggered, unresearched, uncomfortable...Very very slow clap.
1046 2018-01-01 21:03:39 Not reinstalled. Father came to power via military coup, Crowned himself. Abdicated in favour of his son, during Anglo Soviet invasion, who went on to colluded with Clerics & US to overthrow secular elected Gov’t that ‘west’ regarded as does the present due to oil. The constant.

1048 2018-01-01 21:03:31 I guess I put peppermint oil in this mix and now I’m freezing
1049 2018-01-01 21:02:59 An oil diffuser was a great purchase 
1050 2018-01-01 21:02:56 The @marandarcurtis rendition of Victory Belongs to Jesus from the other Sunday at @TPHDallas has me about to pull my weave out. She dumped that place and just walked off. She has her own bucket of oil in the back. I’m convinced. 
1051 2018-01-01 21:02:40 You're claiming MILLIONS of people have used it but not ONE celebrity? Not one athlete? Not one business man that is looking for his next fortune....if you believe that...I have some snake oil to sell you

1053 2018-01-01 21:02:25 Not to defend wind energy that we are forced to subsidize without a personal return, but it is likely a harmless vegetable or synthetic oil.

1066 2018-01-01 21:00:51 Well, stupid Pres. Gump, so how come Saudi Arabia isn't on the list of "terrorist" countries, when the majority of 911  attackers were from there?  Could it have something to do with, oh, I don't know,    OIL???

1074 2018-01-01 20:59:57 Oh yes. The reality of the full spectrum is a fascinating thing, from peacock feathers to Rayleigh scattering, to the pigments used in oil paintings that provide a very complex combination of colour, spectrum wise.

RGB is really child's play, by comparison :)
1075 2018-01-01 20:59:44 If the people who believe in the man made "Climate Change" theory really believed that. Then they wouldn't fly private jets and use yachts. They wouldn't use any plastics or oil based products, or use any gasoline or electricity that comes from coal.

1079 2018-01-01 20:59:01 Your Excellency you are preparing for a future without oil, which is fast approaching. Some are busy moulding status.
1080 2018-01-01 20:59:00 Are they talking about their oil?
1081 2018-01-01 20:58:50 Why did the CIA overthrow Mosaddegh in 1953? He nationalised the Iranian oil industry, which had been under British control since 1913 through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company! #IranianProtests
1082 2018-01-01 20:58:38 Hopefully the #CryptoCurrencies then as oil in the wheels of the economy ?
1083 2018-01-01 20:58:37 By the way, I don't think lard is bad for the arteries. Corn oil is another story.
1084 2018-01-01 20:58:26 I wonder if Fuhr would be the Oilers goalie coach. Or why he’s never done something like that with other teams
1085 2018-01-01 20:58:18 Today I cleaned out our freezer, fridge and pantry, even took vitamins including fish oil 
1086 2018-01-01 20:58:13 How u going to do that homer ‽ no LNG? No oil to shoreline 
We can’t do it on bull  alone! USA puppet! Get this into your head...WE ARE NOT THE USAs oil reserve!!
1087 2018-01-01 20:58:01 Best to keep those medical cards - the better bud will be sold at the dispensaries.. especially if you need the CBD oil.. not that you need that chuck

1089 2018-01-01 20:57:34 We need to protest to get rid of you who condemns peaceful protest, delegitimitizes  every official news media outlet and publication.  Conspiring with Russia when they fund Iran's terrorism. Refusing to sanction Russia who's delivering oil to NoKo? Wasn't Iran on your ban list?
1090 2018-01-01 20:57:23 If anybody sees the trial offer for  CBD oil for $5 shipping don't do it!! The product does not work and in the very fine print that I read,didn't see that if you don't cancel it in 14 days they will charge you $80!!This is a money making scam!! These people are Crooks!! 
1091 2018-01-01 20:57:22 He made far too many iffy bets & was to stubborn to recognize what the outcome would be if some didn't pan out. Perhaps he actually believed 97 could overcome it all.
1092 2018-01-01 20:57:21 Here's hoping they put forth a better effort than the other Oil in town did last night.
1093 2018-01-01 20:57:20 All these people pointing out how trump doesnt critisize Russia for giving north Korea oil probably would like to forget how Hillary gave russia uranium too
1094 2018-01-01 20:57:11 It was Russia giving North Korea oil.
1095 2018-01-01 20:56:51 Absolute horrendous run Christine, think I need to get some cod liver oil in to me system, think I’ve put me hip out doing that run this morning! Either that or I’m outta practice, no exercise for 2 months is there any wonder I’m falling to bits LOL

1098 2018-01-01 20:56:29 Recall when a conservative suggested we build and expand public transit to help more people, and to reduce traffic and dependence on oil/gas?

Me neither.
1099 2018-01-01 20:56:26 (again w person attacks & name calling)
Reason why you can't see a clear connection is that you are obviously triggered by the one child policy (& your several unresearched assumptions about it & it's impact on people) but let me try
More people need more resources/less take less
1100 2018-01-01 20:56:07 It's contractors, Haliburton etc.  Why doesn't the US just invest in Venezuela? They have more oil than Middle East - better yet invest in environmentally sustainable resources.
1101 2018-01-01 20:55:55 with olive oil and black garlic...
1102 2018-01-01 20:55:52 Oregano oil.  Put 5 drops under the tongue and count to 20.  Wash it down with water.  Repeat every 3-4 hours.  Your cold should go away within a day or so.

1104 2018-01-01 20:55:32 Do you mean the regime that the US put in power in the first place?   You know.....for some oil.
1105 2018-01-01 20:55:25 We rub, sear each “side”for about 1 min. or until crispy in a cast iron skillet then cover with foil put in oven at 300 for an hour per pound with fat side up(if no fat layer put a little oil in pan) uncover last 1/2hour add 1/2 cup liquid if needed and increase heat 25 degrees
1106 2018-01-01 20:55:22 Other than a minor leak that I've been told is oil, and the lack of a muffler, it really is. Its treating me quite well now <3
1107 2018-01-01 20:55:13 Jan 1 1982 Peshmerga bombed Iraq-Turkey oil pipeline
1108 2018-01-01 20:55:12 The number of Jews killed is said to be 6 million. I do not know how that's quantified. But I do believe Hitler set to clear Europe of the Jews and did a fairly good job.
1109 2018-01-01 20:54:55 I split time (& vote) in NM - I can't wait for #Martinez to GTFO! Her budget mishaps can't be explained away by her excuse "the unpredictable oil & gas econ." We have had that variable in our econ for decades - she thinks we just fell out of the sky?
1110 2018-01-01 20:54:46 a job in any oil company
1111 2018-01-01 20:54:41 That's fair but also needs to include the mistake of signing Russell to the deal he did. Another blunder was not recognizing how much an impact the departure of both Hall and Eberle would have on the offence.
1112 2018-01-01 20:54:26 It was 9-3 at halftime and 19-3 in the third quarter before South Carolina came back obviously whoever runs this page didn’t watch the game. But happy for the SEC
1113 2018-01-01 20:54:01 I found some on Amazon. It's more expensive for some reason tho. Also I am LOVING the rose hip oil 
1114 2018-01-01 20:53:50 Sometimes I think the only foolproof way of removing all vestiges of glitter from one's hands involves immersing them in a solution of jalapeno oil and benzine.
1115 2018-01-01 20:53:34 "new leader says"  , your core base are OAPs, the same one's who still dont realise you denied them norway levels of prosperity by keeping them poor for votes in the middle of an oil boom. Quicker BLIS gets out of Scotland the better.

1118 2018-01-01 20:52:51 Winter cons:
1. it's 0 degrees
2. I'm sick because it's 0 degrees
3. I'm so pale, my neck looks like a frozen turkey
4. Tons of $ for heating oil
5. Driving/walking=dangerous
6. It takes 3x longer to do anything

Winter pros:
1. It's pretty sometimes and you can ski and ice skate
1119 2018-01-01 20:51:33 It's the Saudis that want regime change...we just want oil
1120 2018-01-01 20:51:26 Why No #MOTD tonight?
1121 2018-01-01 20:51:11 It really does come down to special teams. Oil as good as anyone 5 on 5 (last 2 Jet games aside).   But they lose the special teams game every time out.  Like having to climb Everest as your daily hike.
1122 2018-01-01 20:51:07 And so from the very beginning in 1909, the British had basically total control of Iran's oil resources as a consequence of Qajar concessions.
1123 2018-01-01 20:50:36 Harassment of health care workers,water, crops, population - yes it’s all connected.  What’s ur point? just not able to defend silly tweets?

1125 2018-01-01 20:50:25 The only city that had gas was Teheran, no village had nor gas neither electricity before revolution, Shah gave too many points to USA like free oil, he gave Bahrain a part of Iran to UK!besides 98% of 93% who have voted for refrandom voted for Islamic Republic dude!
1126 2018-01-01 20:50:14 Things I want to accomplish this year!

- Learn how to manage my time to work better and more!
- Make a zine or a doujinshi! Or both!
- Finish my degree with good marks!
- Have at least half the work done for my solo show!

1127 2018-01-01 20:50:03 I still have 3 ozs of ground sinse nugs from last fall's harvest, and about a qt. of potent THC-infused cooking oil.  That should hold me for a few weeks until the authorities sort out the deets on legal pot dealing.
1128 2018-01-01 20:50:01 Lord I was so fine when I first discovered coconut oil.. Lmao
1129 2018-01-01 20:49:57 As I mentioned earlier, the British basically had total control of Iran's southern regions, and the Qajars gave the British the rights to exploiting the resources there. This ended up being disastrous for the Qajars as this southern region happened to be where oil was discovered

1131 2018-01-01 20:49:48 hope my flatmates need their sinuses clearing because I put olbas oil in my bath and I can smell it from my bed on the other side of my flat, happy new year
1132 2018-01-01 20:49:31 Not me.. Was banking on US Fed increasing interest rates and Trump getting the budget pushed through.  Should have retarded the CAD... Who knew our economy was doing this well? Certainly not the oil sector!
1133 2018-01-01 20:49:28 i tell ya for as bad as movies and games can be, looking for the top books is a disgusting process

1135 2018-01-01 20:49:18 I got some oil cloth I’m gonna cover the shelves with...and possible the top. Don’t know yet. Gotta wait and see how it dries out. I might even paint it a soft green. I dunno yet. Don’t want to get too excited incase it’s fucked
1136 2018-01-01 20:49:12 Cheers
1137 2018-01-01 20:49:12 I have essential oil diffusers on all over the house. Ringing in the new year right!

1140 2018-01-01 20:48:45 if you eat more veggies & put vitamin E oil on it , it will grow back fast, my whole entire real name was gone & it grew back in like 3 weeks
1141 2018-01-01 20:48:39 Oil my la toes froze smh
1142 2018-01-01 20:48:18 True, you're right.  Worst is our "regime change" got rid of their democratically elected leader (for oil of course) to install that corrupt tyrant "Shah".  He tortured/ imprisoned/murdered his way thru his reign of terror. Whilst importing his daily lunch & caviar from France.
1143 2018-01-01 20:48:08 I’m going to slice the ham with my professional butcher knife. You can make a mean ham sandwich with rye bread & honey mustard & lettuce & tomatoes and a dash of salt/vinegar/oil for the finisher. Freshly cooked ham, taste better than deli store bought ham. #Legend
1144 2018-01-01 20:47:52 Rates are  gonna go up 1 to 2 % in the USA.   GDP growth seems highly reliant on oil prices
1145 2018-01-01 20:47:51 Scientists were telling us for decades that oil was bad news, and we knew depending on it would mean constant entanglements in the mideast. It's ironic that in Boomer sci fi, everyone listens when the scientists tell them Earth's in danger.

1148 2018-01-01 20:47:16 Which is what happened and not everything has gone as well as the year before. You have to plan for some adversity & deal with it when necessary. Chia did neither.

1150 2018-01-01 20:46:39 So US supported Pakistan & Misdle East for Oil (probably; right)? Since we’re going to spend the next 8 years doing it all ourselves & rebuilding things cheaper here instead of importing .... then why @realDonaldTrump keep supporting
1151 2018-01-01 20:46:38 I thought this said fucking IN garlic & olive oil and got kind of excited
1152 2018-01-01 20:46:26 He’s scared that people can’t survive without oil...

1160 2018-01-01 20:44:52 Fucking Garlic n Olive Oil: Legendary
1161 2018-01-01 20:44:36 I put the oven on 350 degrees but not sure how long. I just keep an eye to it and when it gets flakey I take it out. I'd say about 25-30 minutes. Maybe a bit less. You don't want it to dry out. I put a little bit of olive oil in too.
1162 2018-01-01 20:44:33 I've said repeatedly Sekera won't be the same until next October. Second, confidence is a huge thing & by doing nothing he put this group in a spot where they could get in a hole early on.
1163 2018-01-01 20:44:30 Or, is your argument that the Eberle trade and not replacing Sekera just needlessly fumbled away a season. AKA, a big problem made out of a small problem

1168 2018-01-01 20:43:42 Wow changing the oil is one of the easiest things to do...
1169 2018-01-01 20:43:41 Because it doesn't fix your problem. If your oil is leaking you don't buy fancy new spark plugs.
1170 2018-01-01 20:43:37 Cant smoke but my dad talks about getting hemp oil for us all, which i completely wouldnt mind; 
I wanna get more into edibles tho, but ill bring that up another time.
1171 2018-01-01 20:43:24 Agree with you Andrew - got a large holding in #SDX and think the share price will re-rate. Profitable down to $10 oil and none of the recent good news appears to be reflected in the price.
1172 2018-01-01 20:43:24 So we driving and this is the convo ...

Ron: damn, $30 doesn’t fill my tank any more. 
@davidr_knowles : damn, that mean you need an oil change

1176 2018-01-01 20:42:46 Coconut oil
1177 2018-01-01 20:42:40 We are all complicit in starving Yemenese babies and families.  Trump says he’s pro life but arms and plays footsie with Saudi oil lords sells them our weapons and tech and make us complicit in a human caused famine that is real talk.  I’m not comfortable with murdering babies 4$
1178 2018-01-01 20:42:14 If so, that's not a reason to fire Chiarelli--that means the roster is not in total disrepair. That is a solvable problem. There are a million Jordan eberles in the NHL, and teams regularly move them
1179 2018-01-01 20:42:11 Why taxpayers from MI pay for bombs to drop on Syria, oil firms depletion credit, roads in MS aid to Saudi for war on Yemen, GE tax credits?

1184 2018-01-01 20:41:20 I vaguely remember a place where men wore suits instead of Aloha shirts to dress...
1185 2018-01-01 20:41:03 Now that Sekera is back, do you sincerely believe this team is Jordan Eberle and a few depth players away from the western conference finals?
1186 2018-01-01 20:41:02 Hah, Shah gave oil to USA for free, he killed 3000 people because of revolution, he said I'm the general of the region, by these words he plant the seeds of hatred in Saudi and Iraq, and after revolution we sow it by our hajis killed by Saudi and the war of Iraq against us.
1187 2018-01-01 20:40:57 Yep - I left the "e" off, sure wish we could correct typos!  lol
The teacher had overheard me - correctly - offer another student some peppernut cookies I had helped mom make, with anise oil. Teacher somehow translated that into 'anus oil' and called my parents.

1204 2018-01-01 20:38:26 China seems to have preferred real assets to Treasuries since 2014 at least. eg by stashing 800m barrels of oil: Q1/2/3 2017 stash rate was 1.1m bpd. Limiting factor is storage capacity
1205 2018-01-01 20:38:21 Wee tip someone gave me - if the adhesive marks are left when you take the patches off use baby oil to take them away. No bigger bosum for me anyway!
1206 2018-01-01 20:38:18 The fact that I’m out of shampoo, co-wash, deep conditioner & oil is heartbreaking
1207 2018-01-01 20:38:17 Let's wait for oil exports.. It shall help

1211 2018-01-01 20:38:02 Of course - we don't need to follow China's example by the letter.
But in a country where population is a massive issue and health workers are routinely harassed (& worse) & prevented from doing their work - we really need to talk about what needs to be done drastically..

1213 2018-01-01 20:37:31 Not even a crumb left! Soak bacon in milk & egg in a bowl in the fridge. Coat with all purpose flour. Fry in oil of choice in cast iron skillet. 
1214 2018-01-01 20:37:26 I’m high on oil paint fumes 100% of the time now because my room is small and has no air flow... yikes
1215 2018-01-01 20:37:24 Twitter remains the realest SNS out there. It has the POTUS, porn, rappers, brands, artists, professors, ISIS, VC's, crypto, Wikileaks, cops... meanwhile Instagram forces oil painters to censor boobs 
1216 2018-01-01 20:37:07 Please explain. Bulk: coal, grain, iron ore transport? Crude oil? Oil Products? Gas? Containers? Ferries? Roll on roll of?
1217 2018-01-01 20:37:03 Im so not becoming a minimalist.
But seriously. I just threw out cuticle oil that expired december 2014, because my beau bought it for me. I just gave away a cupcake corer I literally NEVER used in over a year.
Im not getting rid of my story. Im making space for it.
1218 2018-01-01 20:36:59 When 98% of our sources of "information" serve the expansionist interest of Weapons, oil, etc (Wall St iow) THIS is what we get
1219 2018-01-01 20:36:56 One of the best purchases I made in 2017 was an essential oil diffuser. I use it every night with lavender oil. It's very relaxing. Such an inexpensive item for all I've gotten from it!
1220 2018-01-01 20:36:56  2k18 hope you find a better taste in food, oil in overly chopped chicken with mayonnaise should be banned for life!
1221 2018-01-01 20:36:53 With oil at $60/bbl +/- $5/bbl the revenue isn't there for 16 new reactors. At overnight cost of $5K/Kw, that's $80 billion not counting grid improvements
1222 2018-01-01 20:36:47 Get a replacement for Sekera, keep Eberle and look at adding a bottom six depth. Jokinen was supposed to take care of No. 3 but didn't workout.
1223 2018-01-01 20:36:47 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines

1225 2018-01-01 20:36:19 I know, give the Oil Kings the Oilers jerseys, and let an actual TEAM, show the egotists how to play as a team. Would laugh like hell if they won against one of the top teams.

1227 2018-01-01 20:36:05 There is no surplus. We are literally beyond scarcity. The water that feeds Karachi is taken away from villages around it. We import our food. A basic life style is expensive yet poor.
1228 2018-01-01 20:36:03 Just love the feel of oil
1229 2018-01-01 20:35:14 Is anyone telling him that the Iranian people aren't interested in solving their problems by having another western oil friendly dictatorship installed to exploit their natural resources at the expense of their people's welfare?
1230 2018-01-01 20:34:57 I hope this is the year America rebuilds Puerto Rico. Hate to think Trump would want to sell it to an oil drill.

Yeah, MAY not be possible but where in Trump is logic?
1231 2018-01-01 20:34:49 I see black dots, but can’t quite tell what they are. Organic is a gray area, but Neem oil, Garlic oil, but really need to identify the exact bug. Then go for it’s various life stages. Some may require something harsher. And is that inside or outside. Lady bugs & praying mantis.
1232 2018-01-01 20:34:18 Remember the story line of gossip girl where Connor basin was going to have to work his debt off on an oil rig and Serena acted like he was being taken captive by Isis
1233 2018-01-01 20:34:16 So families should have to live below the poverty line because you want cheap oil changes? Keep in mind that even with this wage increase Ontario will still be behind that bastion of runaway socialism, Alberta.
1234 2018-01-01 20:34:13 this + the oil = best combo of my entire life.

1251 2018-01-01 20:31:47 Isn’t it fitting that such a nasty family in power at this time? Trump and @gop believe in the absolute domination of the world and that oil is what greases the engine that drives the world. I wonder what #traitortrumps cut of Putin’s 500 billion oil revenue in arctic will be?

1254 2018-01-01 20:31:35 What kind of oil?
1255 2018-01-01 20:31:32 One of the biggest examples of fake news this year was all the media hyping the oil before the seasom when clearly they were bad.

1257 2018-01-01 20:30:58 Per a Forbes article in 2016, we only import 24% of oil from foreign countries. How does authorizing oil & gas leases in the ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE decrease dependency? The only thing these leases will contribute to is the death of wildlife by destoying their habitat!
1258 2018-01-01 20:30:43 I pay people to change my oil...
1259 2018-01-01 20:30:31 Personal comfort or discomfort is not an argument, it’s a tactic and a poor one. China’s polices have left much to be desired.
1260 2018-01-01 20:30:21 These bowl game names got my mind all messed up. I want chick fil A, file my taxes, and get my oil changed.

1265 2018-01-01 20:30:00 I doubt someone on a low fat diet will see harm from putting an avocado in their bean burrito or some olive oil on their pasta, even if it means they're now "stuck in the middle"

1269 2018-01-01 20:29:27 By what source? 

If you're saying we will have parents with so much surplus that they will spoil their only children (x10 times) then I don't see a problem with that!
1270 2018-01-01 20:29:22 I feel like I'm just going to end up boring you with my responses.

So how about this, let's rewind to the end of last year's Western conference finals. If you were Peter Chiarelli, what would you have done differently to position next year's team for success?
1271 2018-01-01 20:29:13 I think a Zinc/mag actually has great benefits and I take one! Fish or krill oil as well for anti-inflammation. Email me and I’ll go further into details on what is/isn’t important based on your goals

1273 2018-01-01 20:28:40 Hey @nytimes Why in God’s name are you allowing a Treasonous Traitor a Free Pass? Has the Gray Lady become Seditious? Why no articles pointing to Russian oil sales but all over China Why not a daily Emoluments Violations story like HRC E- Mails? Why ?
1274 2018-01-01 20:28:30 Not right but it is because oil wells are drying up in the middle east

1286 2018-01-01 20:26:45 Yep, same here in the UK. And then palm oil, cash crops, blah, blahhhhh. Best we can ever do is damage control and that's going to look different for everyone.
1287 2018-01-01 20:26:43 I forgot how much I loved coconut oil omg 
1288 2018-01-01 20:26:41 That’s old. My new go-to is 16oz room temp water, 1tbsp organic acv, 1tbsp sole, 1tbsp olive oil & some lime.
1289 2018-01-01 20:26:09 OMG what an achievement. I rest my case. besides Kuwait was attacked over oil. Iraq invaded Iran over oil.

1294 2018-01-01 20:25:20 Only reason Kurds don’t lose their territories is because oil companies pay Kurds to watch the oil pipelines thru Kurdistan!
1295 2018-01-01 20:25:01 Lotion in Abuja harmattan= epic fail. Lol

1301 2018-01-01 20:21:55 That because the government is owned by  oil and insurance companies.

1310 2018-01-01 20:20:58 Power and money. Why would we expect dictators to act differently? Need immediate UN sanctions and a boycott on oil, which unfortunately won't matter because the military and the mullahs are in lockstep. There is no one to force the mullahs out.
1311 2018-01-01 20:20:35 What makes you uncomfortable - stop assuming.
1312 2018-01-01 20:20:23 Taking apps for whoever wanna change my oil cuz I'm sick and it's too cold for my ass to be out there on tha damn ground  applicant must also stop and purchase oil filter
1313 2018-01-01 20:20:22 Wait. Dr. Oz is telling us coconut oil isn't good for us now? I guess all of you who were using it to brush your teeth, swishing it around your mouth, and curing every ailment in your life are shit out of luck. Why can't they be wrong about pasta and bread 
1314 2018-01-01 20:20:17 The Queen needs to look into the palm oil they sell in this uk.  It’s one Kain

1323 2018-01-01 20:17:57 I was up to date with the Tunisian revolution, I was in the street, I was on the shoulders of the rebels, I yelled, we organized protests and Al Jazeera that is supposed to be the one who was adding oil on the fire, was not really that helpful, we can't blame it anyway.
1324 2018-01-01 20:17:48 You need to put those "Wakened" brain cells back to sleep 'cause I  am not a "hater".   I, like other intelligent human beings,  just know self-promoting butt-kissing to further snake oil sales when we see it.
1325 2018-01-01 20:17:24 They better make it a good olive branch or President Trump will turn that olive branch into olive oil 
1326 2018-01-01 20:17:17 It’s sooo addictive. And every scene looks like an oil painting come to life. Also Claire/The Queen’s ability to “say everything” with the slightest of facial expressions is so amazing.
1327 2018-01-01 20:17:15 Third world corrupt backwaters (after seizing productive farms).  Venezuela has factors too. Oil *was* state-owned run by Oligarchs and remains. I recall Chavez offered US 100 years of thick gooey oil @ $55+ so lower prices fked both Vene & Russia.
1328 2018-01-01 20:17:12 but on the other hand, this photo, in Instagram., I reminded me a picture with the name "Shout" written by oil paints on a canvas Edward Munch.
1329 2018-01-01 20:17:02 It seemed to have worked in China. Are we going to disregard empirical evidence because it makes us uncomfortable?
1330 2018-01-01 20:17:00 Ahhh yes, that old oil.

1332 2018-01-01 20:16:22 WE can agree that Iran has lots of oil America would like to steal   .Just like we did when we over threw their government in 1953 . #coup
1333 2018-01-01 20:16:12 You don’t know what he found out!  Maybe there are pix of Pakistani ships sending oil to nk!  Must be careful when criticizing. He always has more info than we do. He just doesn’t make it all public.
1334 2018-01-01 20:16:06 Okay cool, I can't speak any other language. Just trying to understand what is going on Iran. Also never understood the US relationship with Saudi Arabia, I know it's oil. But we turn a blind eye to the abuse of women. Maybe I'll take some history classes on the middle east 4 '18
1335 2018-01-01 20:16:00 The old man is just itching for conflict.  He knows Russia gave oil to North Korea, not China.  He must distract.  Rex Tillerson calls General Mattis and tells him to read this tweet.  A second later, General Mattis says, "Moron is an understatement."

1345 2018-01-01 20:15:00 When I see instability in other parts of the world I tend to wonder who benefits from stability and who benefits from the instability. Who is making money off of this?  What deals were made with Saudi Arabia?

1347 2018-01-01 20:14:42 Republican soup not really made from murdered politicians but it's fun to pretend.chop beets, carrots, potatoes, red peppers, onions, cabbage, make red roux by cooking flour in oil, add onions and carrots and scorch a little, throw in vegetables, can tomatoes, red wine, salt.
1348 2018-01-01 20:14:37 NieR question: I have heard multiple people talk about how the "start of route B" stuff was a huge turning point and I have a couple of ideas what they could be referring to but I've never quite pinned it down. Is it the oil scene? Is it the switch? Did I miss something?

1351 2018-01-01 20:14:05 There’s always been a niche market for snake oil salesmen. Every generation has a couple. You’re part of a long, proud lineage of people capitalizing on some of the nation’s great national resources—ignorance and credulity. Congrats on your success!!!!

1354 2018-01-01 20:13:38 Does the #UN Human Rights Commission have anything to say about what is going on now in #Iran? Of course not. #SecurityCouncil? Is #Russia supporting #Mullahs? #China doesn’t care. It likes #Iranian oil.

1358 2018-01-01 20:13:16 Fun fact: in medieval (15th century) Rome, it was so squalid that popular local wisdom at the time had it that the Claudia Aqueduct had been used for bringing olive oil from Naples  Source: Paul Strathern, “The Medici: Power, Money, and Ambition in the Italian Renaissance.”

1380 2018-01-01 20:09:49 Why?  Current coal reserves alone are about 400 years and a couple of hundred for oil. You seriously think that's not long enough to find alternatives?

I predicted in late 2011/early 2012 (oil price $110/$120 bbl or so) that when QE ended oil price would fall to $45 to $50/bbl. I was right, but QE end took a lot longer than I thought it would.

1399 2018-01-01 20:04:20 There's a massive gap between talking about it and enforcing it - at the moment we're not even on the same page if this is a problem and we need to do something about it.
1400 2018-01-01 20:04:20 QE led to oil price inflation via passive investment & Brent/BFOE support via BWAVE/HFT on ICE platform. This macro market manipulation (for resilience/energy security reasons) generated Petrodollars then used systemically to fund indiscriminate US shale oil/gas drilling
1401 2018-01-01 20:04:07 Do you just try to be stupid and dumb for you to be noticed? Our reserve rose bcos of crude oil price increase. What magic did ur man do? Absolutely nothing. Ur really an ode.

1405 2018-01-01 20:03:21 Seems like kind of a chia seed thing which is a little bullshitty for me, because like, how many do you have to eat to get anything out of it... I could see maybe making oil out of them, but then like... any real uses?
1406 2018-01-01 20:03:14 Low magnesium in the blood is important with any autoimmune disease to! Oil on the skin into blood stream! Solves joint pain, fatigue, insomnia, vitamin malabsorption, allergies, gastro issues....
1407 2018-01-01 20:03:11 Not vegan, but hubby is mostly eating vegan at home.. Pumpkin stuffed with nuts, breadcrumbs (a lot of stuffing mixes have no dairy/animal products in them).. mix with nuts, water, and a small amount of extra virgin olive oil.. and sauteed onions.. - I like it.. It's also easy.

1410 2018-01-01 20:02:54 Don't forget GHW Bush was the head of the CIA and in the trilateral commission, the oil embargo made Texas oil millionaires into billionaires as well as property owners almost overnight
GHW Bush was a Texas oil millionaire
Wake up and smell the conspiracy
I was there, don't lie
1411 2018-01-01 20:02:47 Lmao I know right 
I just had my oil changed

1420 2018-01-01 20:01:37 Things like palm oil and cosmetics really caused me a headache, but I started to take my time more and look into everything, to make a more informed choice. A little internet research, a proper shopping list and patience are key!

1425 2018-01-01 20:01:18 I thought Thorne looked incredibly laboured.He's never been agile but seeing him next to Huddlestone was like two oil tankers.

Today we looked leggy and thats despite Rowett freshening it up.Sheffields two front men caused us problems and that meant we sat too deep. Still a draw

1428 2018-01-01 20:00:56 Okay I ordered some from the body shop. It says “ with purifying tea tree oil from the hills of mount Kenya”
1429 2018-01-01 20:00:49 You can get vegan chocolate drops from health food shops.. Or you can make stuff using cocoa powder, coconut oil.. & make your own chocolate bars using oats.. to make chocolate flap jacks.. ? With choc chips in them too..!

Or you could make hot chocolate with soy milk and cocoa?
1430 2018-01-01 20:00:48 We gone see if this oil was worth the money. I better have some long ass eyelashes by the end of the month.
1431 2018-01-01 20:00:41 I remember that
The Saudis and OPEC embargo wouldn't sell oil to us (GHW Bush's buddies) bankers (y'know, Republicans) purposefully manipulated the interest rates Anyone who owned property made money & Iran (part of OPEC) held hostages
All part of the Reagan/Bush plan

Fooled you
1432 2018-01-01 20:00:18 Gotta get my oil changed

1438 2018-01-01 19:59:27 good man Donald,and no oil there either ?
1439 2018-01-01 19:59:23 the best entrepreneurs and management cultures used to come together in a variety of industries; auto, oil&gas, steel, etc. Now the best entrepreneurs and managers go to tech, and tech has evolved from its own industry into a foundation from which to compete in other industries.
1440 2018-01-01 19:59:15 Guess who needs an oil change.....
1441 2018-01-01 19:59:09 It’s because the taste of castor oil is horrible. The diarrhea wasn’t the goal.
1442 2018-01-01 19:59:06 Lol I just never had the right products. When it was short I found out I could use Coconut Curls but the longer it got I just used conditioner and oil.
1443 2018-01-01 19:59:04 Did you? Missed that. Examples Norway signed independent deals with Japan, Canada and SK way before the EU did because one country moves quicker. It also trades oil and gas independently with many other nations.

1449 2018-01-01 19:57:44 Firstly, I thank you for dsummary because honestly I couldn't find dpleasure or strength to read the so called speech. Secondly to stress that you cldnt be further from dtruth. We have a very lazy man as president whose only obsession is NNPC and oil sales. #weshallovercomebuhari
1450 2018-01-01 19:57:42 they r babus who got big kickback for purchasing oil from out side..
1451 2018-01-01 19:57:38 Car is leaking oil. Hoping it was just the seal contracting in the cold -44C. And not the Crank being worn out already. Engine has less that 36xxx km on it
1452 2018-01-01 19:57:37 They say na fraud!
But na oil work be this!
1453 2018-01-01 19:57:27 almond oil is the best
1454 2018-01-01 19:57:07 shiling oil is the best
1455 2018-01-01 19:57:03 2017 I took a bunch of steps forward in art.

Worked with first licensed IP (bobs burgers and MTG)!
Completed my first oil painting
Learned piano
Released two songs as a solo artist

Looking forward to more growth in 2018 
1456 2018-01-01 19:57:03 happened from record amount of debt 1948 to we never had it so good growth of 50's. Scandinavian countries are social Democratic like present lab regime. Norway could be perceived further left with nationalised oil industry which has made them wealthiest per capital head in West
1457 2018-01-01 19:56:42 Thanks, I got Oil of Olay for Christmas.
1458 2018-01-01 19:56:34 My oil light came on and i broke my glasses in half. 2018 already testing me. Lol
1459 2018-01-01 19:56:22 Gonna be honest, I’d buy several bottles of snake oil if someone on FB tried to sell it to me.
1460 2018-01-01 19:56:06 Starting the first day of the year with coconut oil on everything because obviously.
1461 2018-01-01 19:55:54 Yeah... But Iraq ka free ka oil Hy na
1462 2018-01-01 19:55:45 DO YOU  really think we will have any help if N. Korea starts a war? WHO? Russia and China are selling N. Korea OIL even with them agreeing to US sanctions! So who will help us/ You think you want to live like Russia? NO! You like FREEDOM too much or you would´t be HERE!
1463 2018-01-01 19:55:39 But the Trump Administration is also far more friendly to domestic oil and gas production, which will reduce our dependence on Saudi oil — which is their main influence on our foreign policy. I don’t like KSA either.

1466 2018-01-01 19:55:08 I love getting my oil changed and needing the mechanic to explain everything to me everytime because I am consistently clueless.
1467 2018-01-01 19:55:00 He wants our energy independence, helping to increase our production of domestic oil by lifting regulations.  Obama had nothing to do with domestic production, the free market did and now they have help
1468 2018-01-01 19:54:48 Chili oil will be a staple in my diet this year 
1469 2018-01-01 19:54:48 Fart once, warning. Fart twice, castor oil.
1470 2018-01-01 19:54:30 Supplement wise! When I had a coach they sent me a list of supps I needed like magnesium, zinc, milk thistle, krill oil.(I was never wanting to compete just be healthy) I thought it was excessive so I never took them. Should I be supplementing with those or is it overboard?
1471 2018-01-01 19:54:23 Which is why they want to open up the state and national parks and national monuments to drilling. North Korea also supposedly has a lot of oil and natural gas under it, hence why Trump wants to invade.
1472 2018-01-01 19:54:22 sometimes to go forward, one must return to the basics.
Keep in mind that gas and oil are relatively new only like 150 years old and yet mankind has managed to become totally dependent on it.
 have to return to what worked before to feed and stay warm.
convienience issue again.
1473 2018-01-01 19:54:06 Statistically better chance in finding oil/Gas in Arabian Sea than Bay of Bengal
1474 2018-01-01 19:54:04 My dog goes crazy everytime i pull out coconut oilshe  it!..its so weird, she doesnt get THAT excited over other stuff
1475 2018-01-01 19:53:50 “Their social programs”? “Control the economy”? The social programs to which I refer include your health care and education. Big oil doesn’t control the economy, rather they contribute to it - to the GDP, and national wealth.
1476 2018-01-01 19:53:47 Can you seek worldly pleasure all week, then worship God in Spirit and Truth on Sunday? A double mind is unstable. Oil and water cannot mix
1477 2018-01-01 19:53:37 Maps are always better than graphs.

I'm a geologist (amongst loads of other things), used to work on oil rigs. Part of the job was producing a geological map and strata of the North Sea.

Brilliant 
1478 2018-01-01 19:53:22 It is because of the OIL POLITICS, the officers and ministers concerned are under pressure & influence from the sheikhs of middle-east.
1479 2018-01-01 19:53:16 Sis try deep conditioning it or argan/moroccan oil, that should restore the moisture
1480 2018-01-01 19:53:09 One of those oil filled space heaters and some popcorn. Make a nice day of it.
1481 2018-01-01 19:52:48 Oh

Of course

Sorry

Here Greg, use this body oil
1482 2018-01-01 19:52:40 Yup, just plunk down your $200k for Mar-a-Lago or $750 for New Year's Eve. Man of the people, huh? Like the snake oil salesman is a man of the people.

Well, his eating habits approach the lower level of man of the people, I suppose.
1483 2018-01-01 19:52:38 You to. Look forward to your reviews 
1484 2018-01-01 19:52:36 My dad walked the dogs this morning and Eggsy came back smelling like sesame oil... And Hunk smells like Hunk.

1490 2018-01-01 19:51:59 1) The united states has done far more good in the world than bad . 
2) we never got a drop of Iraq oil
3) Israel defends itself against people that don't recognize them and want them all DEAD.
4) I believe in giving to society from my resources, not by government intervention
1491 2018-01-01 19:51:50 They’re telling me it’s going to take an hour and a half to do my oil change......
1492 2018-01-01 19:51:32 But of course. Happy new year.
1493 2018-01-01 19:51:29 The kid you kissed on new years looks like a total pussy anyways and probably still pays somebody to change his oil for him in his car.
1494 2018-01-01 19:51:19 Yes there is a solution, Naval Blockade. No more oil by sea!
If they squack then the cruise missiles can answer!!!

1497 2018-01-01 19:51:10 Across the board would be good .  Regardless . But sadly oil is the main commodity . Not morals .
1498 2018-01-01 19:50:50 I’m an adult with PTSD, depression and anxiety, so I need a way of coping at work. I have a desk where I keep a shoe box filled with many of these items and I travel as well. I carry at least two different kinds of fidget items with me and I wear an essential oil bracelet.
1499 2018-01-01 19:50:50 Now tell me would you prefer to be part of a UK pooling and sharing, where the UK steps in to support Scots public spend in times of probems (oil price crash), or have your budget cut by Brussels with the likes of the measures I've just sent you?
1500 2018-01-01 19:50:35 it is deep fried in an oil of some kind
1501 2018-01-01 19:49:57 Because artist and liars dont mix.. Like oil and water dont get along

1512 2018-01-01 19:48:38 Dad is really sick so I brought him my oil diffuser.

1514 2018-01-01 19:48:32 Holy Smokes. Is Jimmy unpacking boxes at Lucas Oil or what's going on here?
1515 2018-01-01 19:48:23 Supporting people’s liberation movements is a necessary cause.

But the US government cares nothing for people or liberation. 

They care about money, grabbing resources, imperialism. And if you think for a moment that US doesn’t care about Iranian oil you’re laughably mistaken.

1522 2018-01-01 19:46:45 Yes free others while you destroy America . We need to leave our parks alone and Social Security. Get health care for all men, women and children. Let's make a effort to care for American people first. Enough with war . Leave the oil in our soil . Keep cleaning up our home front.

1539 2018-01-01 19:44:44 Probably. But they're going to become too expensive to find. Already happening for offshore drilling. The oil price over the past four years has put a serious stint on offshore exploration.

1543 2018-01-01 19:43:50 Disgraceful that the world powers turned their backs on the Yazidis. Probably because they don't sit on oil wells.

1545 2018-01-01 19:43:09 Was on a 17day cruise out of Singapore. In one of the bars on board were beautiful oil paintings of a variety of ships. I spent hours there sketching them, you can find them on my Instagram charliemcgowan1204
1546 2018-01-01 19:43:06 naissance cold pressed organic castor oil from amazon! get a mixer oil too (almond oil or sunflower)
1547 2018-01-01 19:42:47 I got a bunch of them for Christmas from my oldest son. He also fixed my garage door opener and got the oil changed in my car so he’s in first place for my love
1548 2018-01-01 19:42:05 Hi - We're sorry if you were alarmed! What you're seeing is actually not peanut based. It's a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging that does resemble peanut butter. Could you please DM us the UPC?

1554 2018-01-01 19:41:33 We can call each other nasty names 
Like how a "feminist" can be anti-choice where excessive child bearing has massive & adverse health problems for women leading to early deaths.
or we can talk about facts.
Also it is highly presumptuous to say only poor people have many kids.
1555 2018-01-01 19:41:27 I seriously love candles ! I have my big one lit making the front of my house smell amazeeee and my VS oil one in the room 
1556 2018-01-01 19:41:17 I don't trust America because it is not controlled by the President but the establishment consists of MNC's and deep state millionaires who wants to sell their weapons, Monsanto seeds and oil. So just watch whether America acts over PAK. Don't be orgasmic already.

1561 2018-01-01 19:40:45 Why don't they design a dual price plan?! They can provide special coupon for low and middle-low income group of people. Governments must convince people and offer crystal clear platform how the gains derived from balancing the oil price will be invested.

1566 2018-01-01 19:40:09 僕はただ油にこんにちはを言う練習をする。
1567 2018-01-01 19:39:56 Cause last time I checked the are a bit different? Are we going to follow Norway? And if so how will we give up 1 million$ oil revenue per person.?
Or maybe Denmark?
Or Finland?
Or Sweden? 
They are all different .and do we copy all their regulations as well? It's a whole system
1568 2018-01-01 19:39:45 And I don’t presuppose the answer to this, but when we choose safety with “automated driving” is your average Joe going to be allowed to replace a starter or alternator or change his own oil or will that go the way of airlines where a $0.03 bolt is $50 (pulled #s out of my ass)?
1569 2018-01-01 19:39:43 And don't forget about the OIL coating the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, endangering our seafood INDUSTRY!

1577 2018-01-01 19:39:00 I need some oil
1578 2018-01-01 19:38:58 Is this to distract from the fact that you daddy Vlad is giving North Korea oil???
1579 2018-01-01 19:38:50 So far I haven’t seen any birds at my bird feeder the last 2-3 month. It has black oil sunflower seeds in it. Considering getting a suet feeder as well since I hear birds need that more than Black Oil Sunflower seeds.
1580 2018-01-01 19:38:28 Persian people you're completely blessed, Persia lands provide for oil and for everything allowing filtering exhaust gas coming from thermic technology.

1583 2018-01-01 19:38:10 mmm, I see. But it's okay to bomb people to get at their resources? Kill for oil, by all means. And support racist murdering zionists?  It seems you're a typical Repub then - only caring about what's YOURS and what benefits you and that christianity is the only true religion?

1597 2018-01-01 19:34:46 My hair is pin straight. Zero curl. But the Kopari coconut oil has helped. I also use it to take off my makeup too.
1598 2018-01-01 19:34:22 For next time before taking them off soak and rub them gently with oil (I use coconut oil) and they’ll slowly start to come off 
1599 2018-01-01 19:34:17 Freedom from oppression is understandable. However, oil rich Iran is facing economic hardship because of foreign interference and sanctions that crippled the economy for many years making it difficult for the regime to help its people.

1601 2018-01-01 19:34:09 Stay safe. I’ve seen great rigs with a pulley on a fiberglass ladder to stay clear of oil.
1602 2018-01-01 19:34:07 Questions.
1. How much crude oil do you think Nigeria will export in 30 years time?
2. What will Nigeria's population will be then?
3. What do you project to be the crude revenue per capita?
4. How sustainable is the current structure?
5. Why is "restructuring" a dirty word?

1605 2018-01-01 19:33:46 You’re going apeshit over a 2 cent Ctax increase that will help Albertans, but are silent on the 15 cent oil company profiteering price jump. Why?
1606 2018-01-01 19:33:45 The only difference between today and yesterday is that the tub of coconut oil I bought on sale is now expired

1622 2018-01-01 19:32:05 Is there a plan to run a oil pipe line from Venezuela to Puerto Rico?

1643 2018-01-01 19:27:19 They just need to sell the oil and whole plant properties...smoking this plant destroys most of its medicinal properties. It’s a waste if you ask me.

1658 2018-01-01 19:24:15 That's an escalator, not an elevator. Ethiopian media and accuracy are like water and oil. This is a minor issue; much more concerning is,  what we see also on major issues -- regularly.
1659 2018-01-01 19:24:03 If lesbians wanted to commission an oil painting, the artist would have the right to accept or decline to do so. A custom designed cake is same artistic right - accept or decline-no reason necessary. This decision is an injustice!
1660 2018-01-01 19:23:59 Iran assumed greater strategic importance to the British government, which feared that the Abadan Refinery (of the UK-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) might fall into German hands; producing 8 million tons of oil in 1940, the refinery was a crucial part of the Allied war effort.

1673 2018-01-01 19:22:33 @realDonaldTrump Mr President , Please freeze all personal bank account and assets of the Iranian regime in favour of Iranian people. Members of the regime and their  associates have been steeling the oil and gas revenue which should be returned to Iran once Iran is Free.

1681 2018-01-01 19:20:33 In many ways, the economic aspect of the protest do not contradict the antigovernment aspect. Iran has oil, a highly educated population, and a culture and history that would make it one of the most visited countries in the world. Iran should be wealthy. A free Iran would.

1684 2018-01-01 19:20:02 At least in my opinion oil painting is not the most difficult, you have the time to work colors and "materials". Ink and watercolor are more straight, you must have the skills otherwise you screw up your drawing.

1687 2018-01-01 19:19:29 The truth about How many times a day you need to condition you beard. Honestly, you don’t need to put balm/oil on your beard more than 2 times a day. Personally, I do it 3 times but I love the way it makes my skin feel and I use Beardbrand/Honest Amish and Zeus products! #Beard
1688 2018-01-01 19:19:28 olive oil is like some really niché chef fetish dude it's weird
1689 2018-01-01 19:19:23 He looks like Mickey Rourke marinated in olive oil.
1690 2018-01-01 19:19:19 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
1691 2018-01-01 19:18:40 We have fire rescue and medical teams at the runway for us, we didn’t have oil pressure on one of the wings lol
1692 2018-01-01 19:18:07 great way to start the new year.  2018 is going to be the best. But expect a lot of change intolerance for little rocket man, China for sneaking oil over to NK & keeping our money at home in USA even Iran human rights is in the picture & THE WALL DACA ICE , lots of INDITEMENTS
1693 2018-01-01 19:18:05 Why don’t you go apeshit over the oil company profiteering price increases of 10 to 15 cents per litre rather than the 2 cent Ctax increase?
1694 2018-01-01 19:18:04 Just played: Outside World - Midnight Oil - 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1(Columbia)
1695 2018-01-01 19:18:03 You're clearly needing a visit to Specsavers then. They didn't lie about Europe, their oil reevenue figures came partly from UK Gov depts, the currency debate was a red herring, and there was no lie about legal advice. But I agree it was the most dishonest campaign...by BT.
1696 2018-01-01 19:18:03 Happy New Year everyone. All the best to you and your families in 2018. 

Here’s hoping the Oil can make a strong start to the new year!
1697 2018-01-01 19:17:24 Actually we did not even charge for infrastructure deplete , Fx burden due to higher oil and truck imports
1698 2018-01-01 19:17:20 Always appreciate being appreciated. I just eat. I avoid processed carbs and lately most but not all plant food. I feel better. I don’t add much fat, just a wee bit of butter/olive oil to some recipes.
1699 2018-01-01 19:17:15 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius!
1700 2018-01-01 19:16:52 Lavender, oil, & flowers in the tub type shit.
1701 2018-01-01 19:16:49 The hydration will help your skin not want to produce more oil, so it’s a win win.
1702 2018-01-01 19:16:39 And where does this money to amortize the costs come from? Maybe equalization payments? Cuz nobody does anything for free, ever. So basically we pay to ship the oil to them, and now we get taxed extra for living where the oil is. Fuck off
1703 2018-01-01 19:16:38 I got stuck in the slowest fucking line at Walmart and I was holding this heavy ass jar of coconut oil
1704 2018-01-01 19:16:31 Mom and pop gardens for personal use... plus in this new era of vaping I don’t think it’ll be too long before smoking flowers goes out and oil takes its place ..and that’ll eliminate most of the nuances of various strains. I think there will be some smaller niche farms for custom
1705 2018-01-01 19:16:24 When the IRANIANS finally run their crooked GOV Officials out of the country no doubt they will take billions with them but the good news is with 4 largest oil & natural gas reserves they will be ok very quickly!!!!
1706 2018-01-01 19:16:21 .@realDonaldTrump 
Here's an idea to save the U.S. money so you don't have to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid! 

*** END OIL SUBSIDIES! ***

Now that you've cut Corporate taxes more than 14%, BIG OIL DOESN'T NEED SUBSIDIES ANYMORE!
1707 2018-01-01 19:16:18 This corruption must end soon, Trump and all his oil, coal and Wall Street cronies are ruining this country! Mueller paddle faster!
1708 2018-01-01 19:16:17 Khan sb plz don’t create a fuss oil price have increased worldwide and most of the countries increased it on 1st of Jan including UAE . Not only Pakistan
1709 2018-01-01 19:16:16 And I do have some coconut oil on hand, so maybe I'll try it later. Thanks!
1710 2018-01-01 19:15:56 แล้วจะหายไปเอง 
1711 2018-01-01 19:15:54 I don’t know about y’all but I’m always hesitant to drink any punch with the word piss or oil in it
1712 2018-01-01 19:15:47 Can you seek worldly pleasure all week, then worship God in Spirit and Truth on Sunday? A double mind is unstable. Oil and water cannot mix!
1713 2018-01-01 19:15:38 Patanjali Spermak oil.
1714 2018-01-01 19:15:21 Just drink lots of water and rub some coconut oil on them!!
1715 2018-01-01 19:15:13 I have read your post till November last year and your living today is  miraculous.

My advise to you is to engage in the mystery of the communion, feet washing and anointing oil everyday. 

I believe God for you that you would lift your head to heaven in gratitude. @oluwalegit
1716 2018-01-01 19:15:03 I hope you get what you want honey. With regards to pain management...don’t be afraid/ashamed to use aids (sticks, giant pillows, wrist supports etc), try CBD oil (because your work isn’t mean). Take baths in Epsom salts (do you have a bath?) and take every pill that helps! Xxx
1717 2018-01-01 19:14:49 Irans economy was in trouble when the oil price dropped below $80 a barrel .Then they are fighting two proxy wars .Aside from the men demonstrating there a lot of highly educated women who don't like being slapped down by the regime.
1718 2018-01-01 19:14:46 Pakistan  doesn't even have any oil for us to steal. So why do we give them aid?? Stupid!
1719 2018-01-01 19:14:44 What a privacy coin eh? I've said it and will keep saying it: $XVG is literally the worst privacy coin and everything so far proves me right. The one dev couldn't even figure out how to connect to a radio in an encrypted way,and you trust him with his outdated Wraith snake oil?
1720 2018-01-01 19:14:41 Las Tres Crisis está bien, pero yo soy más de The Oil Crash.
1721 2018-01-01 19:14:29 i just gave myself a hot oil treatment oil is going everywhere

1723 2018-01-01 19:14:13 I would usually serve mash with steak pie, but these look great roasties.
1724 2018-01-01 19:14:11 Just put coconut oil all over hands and then had to open a door.
1725 2018-01-01 19:14:08 Oil them until they are the desired darkness. You can put them in a bucket, cover them with oil, and let them soak overnight. Good luck!
1726 2018-01-01 19:14:01 i used to put a bit of coconut oil on my hands and then pet the cat head-to-toe. and yes, also humidifiers in pretty much every room.
1727 2018-01-01 19:13:38 It may not always seem like it but I usually do. In the minds of some, pointing out their shortcomings mean you want them to fail but nothing could be further from the truth.
1728 2018-01-01 19:13:38 Irrespective of whether his tweet is the or false, honestly speaking, a lot of food stuff we buy these days are full of chemicals. From palm oil to plantain to fruits, kpomo e.t.c. corruption has eaten deep even to our people in the villages. Worrisome.
1729 2018-01-01 19:13:18 Can you seek worldly pleasure all week, then worship God in Spirit and Truth on Sunday? A double mind is unstable. Oil and water cannot mix
1730 2018-01-01 19:13:17 I want fried jiaozi dipped in black vinegar and chilli oil ;(

1733 2018-01-01 19:13:09 大物YouTuberさんと同じ数字だ！！
1734 2018-01-01 19:12:59 So, fried up onions in olive oil, added chopped veggies (carrots, celery, red peppers, parsnips), added green lentils to warm up, put on toast, added (gasp) ketchup and hey, decent veggie type burgers. trying to eat healthier this year.
1735 2018-01-01 19:12:55 Best recipe of 2018 (so far): kale crisps. Wash kale (bought in ASDA for 5 pence!), mix with glug of sesame oil, salt and pepper, and top with nutritional yeast. Bung in oven for 15-20 mins. Umami crispy crunchy yumminess.
1736 2018-01-01 19:12:41 It sure would be nice to have Oil Kings items for auction instead of Oilers stuff.
1737 2018-01-01 19:12:06 try african black soap & palmers skin therapy oil & apple cider vinegar
1738 2018-01-01 19:11:56 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1739 2018-01-01 19:11:54 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1740 2018-01-01 19:11:28 You can say that all you want but it's a fact that every province has always paid more for thier gas and oil products than Alberta. So why is that?
1741 2018-01-01 19:11:27 Oil, seasoning, brown all sides, dry powdered beefy onion, sliced onions

Tip: 4lb. roast = 2 powdered beefy onion packs. 
• 6lb. or 7lb. = 4 packs

Chuck Roast
1742 2018-01-01 19:11:13 What lie? The side I saw lying was the Yes side. They lied about EU membership, the role of oil revenues in our finances, they dissemble over currency, lied about legal advice. Most dishonest campaign I've ever witnessed.
1743 2018-01-01 19:11:04 Broooo I haven’t got an oil change since I bought my car in August  I’m glad the engine hasn’t blown up yet
1744 2018-01-01 19:11:02 I accidentally put way too much tangerine essential oil in my diffuser and now it smells like the Chiquita Banana lady and all her citrusy friends just got mangled by the garbage disposal.
1745 2018-01-01 19:10:39 Done.  No omega 3 oil this time.  Haha

1753 2018-01-01 19:09:36 I just spent 150 for my whip to get a oil change and new air filter 
1754 2018-01-01 19:09:32 How good is this tea tree oil suppose to be?

1764 2018-01-01 19:08:34 @SuburbanPropane we have run out of heating oil and have been on the phone all day with excuses and no solutions. Another company is willing to bring us some emergency oil for a price, but our own supplier can’t? We should not have run out and it is a holiday and -10. HELP!!
1765 2018-01-01 19:08:29 What an epic goal from Lingaaaard
1766 2018-01-01 19:08:22 A cryptocurrency backed by oil, it's actually not a bad idea.
1767 2018-01-01 19:08:16 @edhenry Henry, glad u thawed out from last night and for the most part we enjoy ur programs but did u really say "Will there be war in 2018"? Sweetie, we've been at war for 17 years where have u been and before "W" we had all the oil wars from Papa Bush. WAKE UP!
1768 2018-01-01 19:08:05 Inundate his golf courses with waste from future oil spills in order to let him personally experience the consequences of his decision
1769 2018-01-01 19:07:59 I be put Aragon oil on my face and idk if it does shit, but damn do it smell good
1770 2018-01-01 19:07:57 If only all the games could be played on the road... Glad to see you're looking at the brighter side of the team Rob.
1771 2018-01-01 19:07:55 18 months ago wyoming shut down 200 oil rigs, BNSF started laying people off and cutting their hrs. Our education system suffered because our state had to dip into rainy day funds, teachers were laid off. And our state started losing population.
1772 2018-01-01 19:07:41 I rub it with crushed garlic and little oil when I put it in a pan, but under the broiler, I don't do anything. I think of it like a grill, but upside down. I'm a very basic cook, though.
1773 2018-01-01 19:07:36 ni leopoldo es villalba ni borges es caldera y henry menos es betancourt asi que tu comparacion es triste.  a esos tres personaje le falta politica honestidad y sentido del deber y menos ambicion ante la historia.
1774 2018-01-01 19:07:26 My car definitely needs a oil change I put to many miles on this lil pussy
1775 2018-01-01 19:07:19 We really appreciate if u cld focus on ur country's probs and leave middle east countries...opps, sorry! I forgot u cant do that. Although ur ppl think u came to our region for the sake of peace!!! We know ur here for our oil and gass and other resources!
1776 2018-01-01 19:07:16 Some oilers fans need to calm down. That being said, I miss hendricks and I think the room does too. But to say that the oil are where they are because pitlick and pouliot aren't here is nonsense. #oilers
1777 2018-01-01 19:06:55 Our bulldog is keeping us up at night.. ordered oil and treats for him today. Hoping it helps with his aggression and sleep apnea.
1778 2018-01-01 19:06:54 Never tried oil.  I like watercolour but coloured oil pencils are my favourite. But this year I am determined to use mediums I find more challenging.
1779 2018-01-01 19:06:45 According to Mukesh Ambani, "Data is the new natural resource. We are at the beginning of an era where data is the new oil ," so his company gives out 4g enabled phones after paying Rs 1500 refundable after 3 years. 2/3 of Indians don't have internet.
1780 2018-01-01 19:06:18 Don’t cross the line, duh!!!! It’s called oil. 
1781 2018-01-01 19:05:55 I've played around a little with watercolor pencils and oil pastels but haven't mastered them yet!

1787 2018-01-01 19:05:31 Meanwhile big oil is investing $180 billion in developing more plastic production.  I would guess not one penny will go toward setting up effective recycling.  On a positive note Lego is researching how to ditch plastic for the 60 billion bricks it manufactures every year!
1788 2018-01-01 19:05:30 Noxzema is pretty good to clean your face at the end of the day. Use a charcoal face mask a few times out of the week. Clean & Clear morning burst is clutch in the morning. Lastly don't be afraid to use a little Shea Moisture coconut oil or African Shea butter.

1791 2018-01-01 19:05:00 yes but don’t od bc the peanut oil will break u out
1792 2018-01-01 19:04:57 we thought....it would be “fun”...we thought...it would be “chill”... we... thought...wrong...*dies in a pool of CBD oil*
1793 2018-01-01 19:04:56 Too many  For starters, the glycolic cleanser, the vitamin c serum & the radiant glow face oil
1794 2018-01-01 19:04:31 Big oil has heated our homes, operated our transportation, helped run our economy and finance our social programs. However, they, particularly Enbridge and TransCanada, are also major investors in renewable energy, including in hydro, solar, nuclear and wind power.
1795 2018-01-01 19:04:24 How is my oil tank already empty? I just spent $400 filling it 2 months ago. SOS
1796 2018-01-01 19:04:06 Last night I was off that oil frfr
1797 2018-01-01 19:03:46 Mrs HillaBARRELy is a oil burner habitant.
1798 2018-01-01 19:03:41 I’m more than just a nice smile and brown eyes . I’m composed of honey  suckle, coconut  oil, Shea butter dipped in honey and kissed by the sun . I’m that chrysanthemum  that grew from the concrete. Melanin beauty . That’s me 
1799 2018-01-01 19:03:36 There used to be General Studies class at Tech College, at 18 I wondered how useful it was for mending oil refineries.
By mid 20s I usefully recalled:- Mortgages, Interest, fiscal policies, recession, GDP, Welfare State, Property tenure, Taxation.
Not sure it's taught anymore...
1800 2018-01-01 19:03:34 And steal their oil..beware Iran
1801 2018-01-01 19:03:20 Provident Financial - very low p/e ratio - yes agree recovery potential - very volatile. Will recover- down 75% from peak. Oil majors are so efficient now in getting oil out - $40 breakeven, if Iran situation gets worse oil goes to $100. BP in dollar terms cheap even after rally
1802 2018-01-01 19:03:18 Oil, Steel, Land ... Throw a War & make the GOP rich get richer
1803 2018-01-01 19:02:59 Me too! I more comfortable with watercolor or Indian ink, oil is my favorite. Don't give up it starts well. :)
1804 2018-01-01 19:02:42 Uhm.. misinformation... from a very left news source... Your FARTS and your cows FARTS do more damage to the air around you then a oil rig somewhere. If you want to blame anyone, blame the vegans that are eating all our greens, and saving the cows! We have being over ran by cows!
1805 2018-01-01 19:02:39 and Europe/Italy has one less option as far as oil goes..
1806 2018-01-01 19:02:15 Great news in New Year, ONGC has made a significant oil and gas discovery to the west of its prime Mumbai High fields in the Arabian Sea. But what stopping India in exploring Oil & Gas in Andaman & Nicobar Islands?
1807 2018-01-01 19:02:02 That’s rough. I replace so many things with coconut versions (flour, oil, sugar, milk...lmao)
1808 2018-01-01 19:01:43 Protein treatment every two weeks or monthly..
One egg, 1 tbs each of honey, olive oil and coconut oil. 
Leave for an hour and rinse off.
Apply coconut oil on your hair.
You can also do a green tea rinse to prevent breakage.

1815 2018-01-01 19:00:33 No it won't. It didn't, it hasn't, it never will, and he Still hasn't a clue what climate change is. All Trump knows is it's bad for the pockets of his friends in the oil industry that can't see the writing on the wall telling them to reinvest it all in fusion & renewable energy.

1818 2018-01-01 19:00:24 A soup I make all the time: sauté like 3 celery stalks, 3 carrots, half an onion and a little oil until the liquid is nearly evaporated and then add a full thing of chicken stock and half a box of cooked orzo/small pasta. Easy and lasts for a few days!

1821 2018-01-01 19:00:00 Looks like western powers are trying to engineer regime change in Iran. What's the bets (if unsuccessful) it ends up in a War with our Corperate MP's screaming to get involved. Iran will end up losing it's State owned oil and it will become even poorer as it's siphoned off
1822 2018-01-01 18:59:53 wti crude oil
1823 2018-01-01 18:59:49 Oil making good base in current fall
Once break immediate hurdle 377/379 zone,In my view a rally towards 425 possible
Till side way
Weak if break 365 level
1824 2018-01-01 18:59:38 And who will see the benefits of master limited partnerships besides oil companies, you, Ted Cruz and your former aide who lobbied for it?
1825 2018-01-01 18:59:38 The vape fluid is cheaper than the oil you rub on. I find it works really well for low to mid level pain but when I get really bad pain I do still have to rely on meds from the dr coupled with the CBD vape. It's finding what works for you which is a pain in the ass.
1826 2018-01-01 18:59:34 It's all about the oil & gas pipelines into Europe through Syria from Iran or Saudi  .......Fact
1827 2018-01-01 18:59:26 You get to know the places where they're likely to appear and grow again each season. I also freeze and preserve certain varieties in olive oil as they do in Italy. There are many fungi forays offered now during autumn. Possibly near near you too.
1828 2018-01-01 18:59:22 Nah, Iran has more oil than those others do
1829 2018-01-01 18:58:54 I'm confused. If your implying the Oilers are not gruesomely under-achieving in their standard of play? They absolutely are. Criticize Chiarelli all you want...but...mentally...this team isn't even showing a tick on the monitor.
1830 2018-01-01 18:58:29 Smokin that good oil New Year’s Day lookin forward to doing big things and getting big high this year
1831 2018-01-01 18:58:23  trying to slick a can of oil .
1832 2018-01-01 18:58:10 As someone who has never been high, but uses cbd oil for my anxiety, this is offensive. I’m by no means a liberal, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with marijuana.
1833 2018-01-01 18:57:59 Keep planning for bizarre weather patterns because Republican big donors own oil companies & stock.
1834 2018-01-01 18:57:55 Well done Ireland, now 33rd in global economic table (out of 192).  Just  4.7 million people, no oil, but hey - self-governing like the vast majority of countries and able to make the right decisions for their own growth, wellbeing and prosperity.  Maybe we could do the same!
1835 2018-01-01 18:57:23 For the people that saw it, like you, and the people that sadly missed it, like me, there will be something for everyone. Keep up the great work!
1836 2018-01-01 18:57:21 Yea, it would have been even more modern, and complete with a democratic government, if the USA didnt overthrow Mossadegh in the 50's because he wanted more of the oil profits for his country. Shah was a US puppet dictator that probably killed& tortured ppl w/o due process.
1837 2018-01-01 18:57:20 You protein-sensitive? I am. So I rarely use heavy protein products. Coconut oil is one of them.
1838 2018-01-01 18:57:11 Have you considered using watercolour (or oil) pencils? You could draw in pencil & add water to make a watercolour painting.
1839 2018-01-01 18:57:10 President Hunt. The program includes 12 value-added benefits that save their customers thousands of dollars during their vehicle ownership experience.  Such benefits as LIFETIME Oil and Filter Changes, LIFETIME Virginia State Inspections, LIFETIME Loaner Car Program,
1840 2018-01-01 18:56:40 Try swishing coconut oil and spitting it out. Followed by gatorade and vitamin c tablets or a multivitamin. Ib profen for the headache and keep drinking gatorade and water all day
1841 2018-01-01 18:56:39 If you really are keen on "...drastically and immediately move away from fossil fuels" then you need a plank in your platform that specifically says you will end fracking, oil pipelines and other harmful effects to the environment! @Ironstache has oil ties via his handlers!
1842 2018-01-01 18:56:20 I’ve been on the beard oil wave but y’all gonna respect me or see these hands
1843 2018-01-01 18:56:19 and yet it seems to work just fine on the road
1844 2018-01-01 18:55:48 In 2018 we are:
-Composting
-Recycling
-Not shopping at Walmart
-Buying organic
-Emailing our people in congress 
-Not eating anything with Palm Oil
-Reading food labels 
-Yet again, not shopping at Walmart
 
All in an effort to make this world better for ourselves/environment
1845 2018-01-01 18:55:47 Guess who almost tricked my 10-year-old brother into saying the f-bomb?

Whale 
Oil
Beef
Hooked

I did. 
1846 2018-01-01 18:55:43 Can u send the names and websites of the Universities. That’s what they could achieve with over $22b OBJ saved in excess crude account & d $bs we realize 4m oil boom? It is unbelievable how gullible pple cld be!
1847 2018-01-01 18:55:21 Clueless kid being led around by snake oil salesman lol
1848 2018-01-01 18:55:09 this wild growth oil got my head itching bad

1852 2018-01-01 18:54:31 Used makeup remover wipes, baby oil, a face mask & moisturizer and still managed to have lash glue stuck on my eyes WTF 
1853 2018-01-01 18:54:30 I use Shea butter , coconut and castor oil then the Leave in conditioner after

1855 2018-01-01 18:54:21 I roast it in the oven usually with bacon, Tony’s, and olive oil (or bacon drippings if you’re going all out) and it doesn’t smell bad.
1856 2018-01-01 18:54:02 You need some peppermint oil? Lmao
1857 2018-01-01 18:53:57 USA is responsible from the economic crisis (if there is one) in İran. Because you didnt let them sell their oil for 40 years. You send your dog saddam to İran and a war began for 8 years. Trump and US is the last one to talk about İran.
1858 2018-01-01 18:53:57 It isnt available on the dutch healthcare system either but available in some shops. I think a bottle of oil drops costs around 30 to 40 euros if i remember correctly.
1859 2018-01-01 18:53:38 laying cold hands on himself.
And his two little jiminies, cousins of ourn, Tristopher and Hilary, were kickaheeling their dummy on the oil cloth flure of his homerigh,
1860 2018-01-01 18:53:34 Okay.
I’ll get .
What do I oil the hair with after wash?
Shea butter?
1861 2018-01-01 18:53:32 right tell that to the Christians, to the Jews (anti-semitism on the rise as he promotes Islamaphobia) West versus east,  killing thousands of jobs in the oil fields, broken promises galore with FN --the list goes on! And yes, broke the law and selfied his way out of it!
1862 2018-01-01 18:53:26 Coconut oil dried the hell out of my skin and hair. I’m glad it works for some of you but it doesn’t seem to like me
1863 2018-01-01 18:53:13 Snake meet oil. #ProfitGospel
1864 2018-01-01 18:53:12 .Oh how I wish I had those delightful number cards to hand when my numerate exes bamboozled me with receipts for their spa 'specials' & the positive effects the warm jojoba oil had on their supple bodies, but, alas, a negative hole in my bank account! 
1865 2018-01-01 18:52:52 I put coconut oil in Nana's hair and braided it. Now all he needs is a leather jacket
1866 2018-01-01 18:52:50 Agree! But the tank is outside near the house, oil line goes through the foundation to the burner. It’s happened 2 x now in 22 years.
1867 2018-01-01 18:52:50 see you let the cat out the bag even in a single tweet. "looted of wealth'. We know that gets you all moist in the panties. fancy some oil now? you don't care about the people. if you do, prove it with free air drops of food and meds. well?
1868 2018-01-01 18:52:44 On the first pk last night I saw almost a perfect square alignment with very little movement or attack. Very robotic looking wasn’t impressed for a team who dedicated an entire practice to it’s pk.
1869 2018-01-01 18:52:43 AT THE MOVIES FIXING TO WATCH "ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD!" AN OIL MONEY MOVE 
1870 2018-01-01 18:52:42 Empty structures without equipment that’s all we GEJ could achieve with all the money we made 4m oil boom?  Embarrassing and shameful!!
1871 2018-01-01 18:52:31 They supported Putin when he first came into power. He was handpicked by Yeltsin on the understanding that he wouldn't prosecute Yeltsin & co. for corruption. 'Western' opposition to Putin came later following  Putin's opposition to IraqW2 & 'internationalization' of Russian oil.
1872 2018-01-01 18:52:13 look what happened when we stuck our nose in Iraq and forced regime changed, that really worked out well for the region. (sarcasm) it is inexcusable what western countries oil greed has done to peoples of the middle-east/Persian Gulf since 1917 (nineteen seventeen)
1873 2018-01-01 18:52:12 He is unfit. Last weeks attack on China when the next day there were stories of Russian and North Korean oil transfers all over the news. He’s a menace.
1874 2018-01-01 18:52:11  coba bandingkan dgn harga crude oil dipasaran baru bilang naik atau turun, terus coba juga check di lapangan apa iya premium tersedia seperti pertamax, jgn hanya cerita tipu2 media terkesan murah tapi nyatanya semua mahal 
1875 2018-01-01 18:51:48 Haha you all were worse off than Spurs on the trophy department prior to oil money.  And how exactly is the new stadium not going to help us up the wage bill?  Sure it is more difficult for Spurs bc they are a smaller club but proved last two season they can compete
1876 2018-01-01 18:51:38 @MEAIndia @SushmaSwaraj @PMOIndia Good time to attack electric supply/transformers/oil/LNG depots in pakistan thru proxies and textile tycoons,will make pak people come out on streets against their govt.

1879 2018-01-01 18:51:18 NK needs oil.... They will be feeling the embargo pinch by now
1880 2018-01-01 18:51:14 My 2018 predictions: reits lower, domestic stocks lower, international/emerging lower, oil higher, gold higher, btc lower
1881 2018-01-01 18:51:13 Our youth are the future. 13-yo #AutumnPeltier, of the #WikwemikongFIrstNation in #Ontario, is set on protecting the world’s #Water. She fussed at PM Trudeau about #oil #pipelines, and walked
1882 2018-01-01 18:51:10 The Jets didn't have their best player and they smoked the Oilers anyways. Not for any other reason other than the Oilers continue to play like a bunk bunch of cardboard cut-outs of real NHL players.
1883 2018-01-01 18:50:42 It obviously happened but the resulting oil slicks never happened...some but not the expected size..the earth ate it
1884 2018-01-01 18:50:39 The only Browns merch I own is a garage towel I use when I change my oil....#goodwill #cardsfan2015
1885 2018-01-01 18:50:26 Going to take the opportunity an have some other work done like belts an oil change an of course a new battery. Bad side is this screws up my medications refills an buying stuff I needed to get back drawing but all things in time as they say.
1886 2018-01-01 18:50:14 that coconut oil really do It had my face looking magical 
1887 2018-01-01 18:49:58 Pogba dan iska 
1888 2018-01-01 18:49:58 yes. was just telling someone what products i use on my hair and i told them how much olive oil i use.
1889 2018-01-01 18:49:46 Iran is important geographically but also it’s a money thing and oil
1890 2018-01-01 18:49:42 Isnt CBD Oil available in the UK? It should have the same medicinal effects as marijuana.
1891 2018-01-01 18:49:35 Remember when he said he wouldn't see oil above $44/barrel in his lifetime....good one!!!!
1892 2018-01-01 18:49:35 doesn't have to be this way, Canada is an oil rich country and has been duped by the climate change scammers
1893 2018-01-01 18:49:17 Coconut oil makes my hair hard. I only use olive oil.
1894 2018-01-01 18:49:10 Yes and it's not particularly close
1895 2018-01-01 18:49:08 Trump's empty tweets offer NOTHING to the uprising.
The rebels need communications equipment.
We must have a blockage of Iranian oil tanker ships coming out of the Persian Gulf.
1896 2018-01-01 18:49:01 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
1897 2018-01-01 18:48:53 I love that every time I step into my room all I can smell is oil paint
1898 2018-01-01 18:48:30 Tayar dah pump, chain dah oil, boots dah basuh n condition, barang baik dah top up. Gonna start sch on a good note
1899 2018-01-01 18:48:24 Need to get my car detailed and a oil change ASAP ...
1900 2018-01-01 18:48:14 At 30$? Maybe expecting crude oil achives USD150
1901 2018-01-01 18:48:08 Much appreciated and can't wait for the release of the doc. Fuhr was one of my two favourite athletes growing up and I was lucky enough to watch it all unfold from start to finish. @MakingCoco
1902 2018-01-01 18:48:06 This is a temporary car that is not worth fixing bc it cost too much to fix this is one of those desperate times car I got the over 3000 miles with it just by keeping oil in it and get ur money's worth lol this car is far from perfect
1903 2018-01-01 18:47:56 adding olive oil to my conditioner has done wonders
1904 2018-01-01 18:47:54 Lingard dey play none sense today
1905 2018-01-01 18:47:51 These people have no insight at all, he cares not for their people but their oil!
1906 2018-01-01 18:47:49 This woman has aphids, or maybe scale insects. Fetch the neem oil.
1907 2018-01-01 18:47:44 Let’s step up oil and gas exports to Europe so they feel comfortable speaking out. Not only against Iran but also Moscow! How about we #stoptalking and do something about it. #IranProtest #PoliticiansAreAllTalkNoAction
1908 2018-01-01 18:47:40 When your olive oil is trying to hide how big of a slut they are so they say they are "extra virgin." Smh
1909 2018-01-01 18:47:35 That’s be cool - write it in a Louisiana setting after an oil rig blow
1910 2018-01-01 18:47:32 Don’t know about #Republicans anyone without drug or old oil money or kids of #WallsStreet execs should hate college as cost of education has gotten worse than North Korea’s missile threat and student loan interests are more than renting #TrumpTower apartments. @krysboydthink
1911 2018-01-01 18:47:18 I don't doodle as much as I should ^^; If I do, it's digitally & I delete them. I'd like to get into oil painting but it's hard to find time & space.

1914 2018-01-01 18:46:29 @LondonFu have i mentioned it freezing weather out here. Its so cold i think my olive oil on window sill seperated in the bottle.
1915 2018-01-01 18:46:26 Okay guys: coconut oil on your face is seriously the most soothing.
1916 2018-01-01 18:46:23 This has everything to do with the uncovering of secret oil shipments from Russia and China.
1917 2018-01-01 18:45:53 absolutely,I agree with @funder ,I concerned Pres Trump's Remark actually not true,there are many reasons behind market going up,sentiment,economy,growth,earning,oil,domestic & international factors,though I concerned Pres Trump's policies,#Healthcare,#TaxReform could hurt..

1920 2018-01-01 18:45:23 Low oil pressure

1923 2018-01-01 18:45:09 Pogba with the assist
1924 2018-01-01 18:44:50 All I'm saying is that like in Iran and many other places in the world, the US does not care about the people or justice or democracy, it cares about money, oil and strategic power.
1925 2018-01-01 18:44:48 Makes a lot of difference when Chelsea can buy their entire squad. Prior to that oil money you all were an average club.  He’ll win trophies with Spurs.  With the new stadium we are closing the gap without an influx of foreign capital.
1926 2018-01-01 18:44:46 Gooooooaaaaalllllllll martiallll #MUFC
1927 2018-01-01 18:44:18 Welcome. Your simplification of bargaining principles helped frame my thesis on cross-border oil and gas pipelines (and my book eventually). All the best for 2018
1928 2018-01-01 18:44:17 I’ve also heard of poorly cleaned restaurant tablecloths with oil still ingrained in them going up in tumble driers.
1929 2018-01-01 18:44:05 I’m deadddddd Courtney is like I’m getting this oil right now.
1930 2018-01-01 18:44:03 "Lord of the universe look in love upon your people.
Pouring the healing oil of Your compassion
on a world that is wounded and dying.
Send us out in search of the lost,
to comfort the afflicted, bind up the broken,
& free those trapped under the rubble of their fallen dreams."
1931 2018-01-01 18:43:42 It is now 2018...Can you please ask the illegitimate POTUS @realDonaldTrump when we can expect the tough new sanctions against Russia and Putin for election interference and for Russia providing oil to North Korea!
1932 2018-01-01 18:43:39 Yesterday I got my oil changed &When the guy came out and turned on my car it started blaring “sex with me.” Leaving embarrassment in 2017.
1933 2018-01-01 18:43:28 I have looked at his evidence last time he stuck his head up about this. Not websites that are fit to be quoted. Smoking skunk under 21 can cause problems for a small %, no doubt about that. My step sister has used CBD oil and it has taken away pain. She has not smoked for 30 yrs

1935 2018-01-01 18:43:19 Love your products and your commitment to the people who harvest and extract Argon oil.  Demonstrating how to be a responsible Hooman.  
Happy New Year!
1936 2018-01-01 18:43:10 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for dry brushing, and put some aloe essential oil in my diffuser.
1937 2018-01-01 18:43:09 I filled Bee's Skell with oil
1938 2018-01-01 18:43:00 The coconut oil froze in my hair :(
1939 2018-01-01 18:42:59 Gets home: 

-Did you get dad a birthday present?
-Doesn't your winter course start today? 
-Can you go to Wal-Mart and buy oil?
-Can you tweet Gordon Ramsay for us later? 

SO MUCH FOR TRYING TO CHILL FOR A DAY.
1940 2018-01-01 18:42:57 Take away each teams' best player and the Jets smoke the Oilers.
1941 2018-01-01 18:42:46 Oh man i cant even imagine, ive never had keytones, if youre in one of the cannaboid oil free states ive heard its amazing for controlling bs. How old where you when you where diagnosed?
1942 2018-01-01 18:42:39 Has anyone ever used bio oil
1943 2018-01-01 18:42:35 Putting Olbas oil (Vicks drops) on my upper lip to unblock my nose was a very bad idea. I'm now have a persistent burning sensation 
1944 2018-01-01 18:42:28 They'll be taking us to war and killing our kids, friends, us. And probably give the oil fierlds to #Putin #BendOverAmerica #TrumpWars
1945 2018-01-01 18:42:18 I interpret the article more as suggesting US interference created conditions ultimately leading to the 79 revolution. Since the Shah was installed to ensure favorable terms for US oil companies I can't picture CFR wanting yet another revolution.
1946 2018-01-01 18:42:04 Oil my tits up big boy.
1947 2018-01-01 18:41:49 Yes, oils. But not just 10$ bottle. Has to be the real stuff from Oman. The FDA only recommends manufacturers to put 5% actual oil in a bottle to sell as”100% oil”, so only certain brands will be helpful, not all 
1948 2018-01-01 18:41:48 Wait, what kind of oil do you use?
1949 2018-01-01 18:41:21 剪定とか平行とか未来とか異聞とかめちゃくちゃ裾広げてるのでどうなるのか分からないですね、、
宇宙からの侵略者って鋼の大地だかエクステラだかみたいな大テーマも出してきて型月はFGOで終わる気なのかとすら思っちゃいますねw
1950 2018-01-01 18:41:14 What happens if Saudi Arabia surpasses the USA due to allowin them the richest oil company on the globe? I'll tell you what happens: An army 40x the size of ISIS 1000x better equipped, our leaders are dumb A-Holes all of them real talk, they support the people beheading citizens.
1951 2018-01-01 18:41:06 If I'm right then it's an oil based lubricant and will destroy rubber.
1952 2018-01-01 18:40:58 You should probably read that again Julia No-Cluer you've been on the snake oil haven't you.

1954 2018-01-01 18:40:46 Easier to not crave carbs when doing high doses of healthy fats.
Coconut oil, Olive oil, organic butter,  
Look to #Ketogenic diet.
If you like coffee check out 'bulletproof' coffee.
Healthy fats feed the brain.
1955 2018-01-01 18:40:45 I hate the smell of cooking oil on my clothes 
1956 2018-01-01 18:40:39 Son so damn good. It was sitting in some heavy ass oil though but I needed it to nurse this hang over 
1957 2018-01-01 18:40:26 Beard oil na scam 
1958 2018-01-01 18:40:21 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
1959 2018-01-01 18:40:12 Better wingers. And that's about it, actually. Oilers are much better at centre. Should be at least equal on D.
1960 2018-01-01 18:40:12 Yeah! Rub you Down with Hot Oil Lotion!
1961 2018-01-01 18:40:09 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
1962 2018-01-01 18:39:59 ~ SLE (Lupus) & Fibromyalgia. Oil doesn't cause a high. Very small amounts used.
1963 2018-01-01 18:39:54 You better get back to DC and STOP Russia from supplying North Korea with oil. Doing NOTHING is making the US look WEAK. If you’re not going to play golf, DO SOMETHING!!!  We all know you’re lacking in diplomacy but maybe you could ask previous Presidents for help!
1964 2018-01-01 18:39:34 Say likimo nake a gaban TV
1965 2018-01-01 18:39:28 I'm looking for my suntan oil. Once I find it I'm on my way...
1966 2018-01-01 18:39:27 #NerdCleaningTips: Wipe down your computers with Murphy Pure Vegetable Oil Soap. It smells nice!
1967 2018-01-01 18:39:06 Lol true, I make a homemade scrub for my lips. Brown sugar, honey and oil. Takes away dead cells
1968 2018-01-01 18:38:54 Como olvidar ese mínimo Charlie en TS! Un grande. Casi la largo. Soy muy optimista con el sector. El oil está en backwardation, la demanda no afloja y China con inventarios en mínimos. El shale en Usa avanza pero no alcanza. Los rigs también pero sigue habiendo escasez de oferta
1969 2018-01-01 18:38:41 Why we allowing Aramco to control the oil fields? No issue with Trump but he's the same as the rest he said he would make America great but is actually making Saudi Arabia great? Check how strong their military is since he got in office and it's not just him it's his priors too.
1970 2018-01-01 18:38:17 I left the oil field 5 years ago and struggled finding a decent job and was spinning my wheels. Sometimes it takes a while, but you will find it.
1971 2018-01-01 18:38:16 If you want bites then go to Man City pages and talk about oil money...never seen fans so rattled. 
1972 2018-01-01 18:37:57 Am I the only person who actually turns oil and lotion bottles upside down so I can get the remaining product?
I’m that frugal 
1973 2018-01-01 18:37:53 Even an Albertan must realize big oil is playing with your Little penis

1976 2018-01-01 18:37:44 Not sure why you want Lucic with Draisaitl. Draisaitl needs a gunslinger on his wing, fast hands, preferably fast skater too. I know that’s wishful thinking But at this point I prefer Kassian over Lucic just for his speed. Strome, Lucic and Letestu make a good 4th line
1977 2018-01-01 18:37:35 @Shawntaswayy Hello, Happy New Year when will your growth oil be available again?

1980 2018-01-01 18:37:19 THEY HAVE LOADS OF OIL IN Iran.  Why are they poor?
1981 2018-01-01 18:37:14 
1982 2018-01-01 18:37:07 Stick with the Oil. There's no other team.  #LetsGoOilers
1983 2018-01-01 18:36:42 Been here 3 hrs for an oil change and I was the 2nd car at 8
1984 2018-01-01 18:36:36 Many people use the CBD oil low in THC because they don't want any kind of 'high'; they just want the other medicinal benefits. I'd also like to see more promotion of CBD oil, as well.
1985 2018-01-01 18:36:27 Beard oil! And beard balm 
1986 2018-01-01 18:36:18 Iran has oil but is a shit pit, Israel doesn't have oil but is prosperous. I will never understand you. @jeremycorbyn @guardian
1987 2018-01-01 18:36:01 I would love to watch more Jets games but with crap regional broadcast rules we are stuck seeing Leafs and Habs still.  I'll just fire up Kodi more
1988 2018-01-01 18:35:55 The wind turbine folks just need to get smarter. Build the turbines in existing oil fields and if they leak oil, just blame the oil company.
1989 2018-01-01 18:34:47 100% agree. People aren't thinking this through. The protesters were paid to divert while western backed jihadists blew up an oil pipeline.
1990 2018-01-01 18:34:20 Yes, I am not a pot user. But I live in a state that legalized pot, and it makes sense. Plus, apparently cannabis oil heals without a high.
1991 2018-01-01 18:34:20 1/...
 Syria at the crossroads
Sykes Picot carved it up:
Man can you feel so low
When all tear you apart!
Your lovely green hills roll
Your coastline cities bright...
Yet it's in the desert
That all will take a fight!
For is it your water
Or rather oil so light?

.../3
1992 2018-01-01 18:34:19 How about your oil buddies in Saudi Arabia?
1993 2018-01-01 18:34:02 This fascist system, which strengthens the money of oil and gas and easily sheds light on the people, must only be eliminated by the American military strike. Our people in the streets are killed and lost their weight and they are not sponsors of them.
1994 2018-01-01 18:33:54 Learn from those European countries who are dependent upon Iranian oil? No way.
1995 2018-01-01 18:33:47 every single time the President abolishes a crucial regulation, Paul Ryan silently assumes he is winning #tiredofwinning
1996 2018-01-01 18:33:47 For soup, cook diced shallots in oil, then simmer with chicken, red curry paste, beef broth and lemongrass. Top with orzo.
1997 2018-01-01 18:33:47 Here's an idea for your next project! Oil pastels + birds + song lyrics + textured! Go!
1998 2018-01-01 18:33:47 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1999 2018-01-01 18:33:47 My skin is looking SO GOOD with and without makeup I’m literally GLOWING!!! S/o to tree tea oil and oxy pads!!! Even my acne scars are fading BLESSSSSSS
2000 2018-01-01 18:33:47 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
2001 2018-01-01 18:33:38 I love chili oil! (*ﾉ▽ﾉ)
I could just drink it straight from the bottle!
2002 2018-01-01 18:33:25 I did not say top alone...I said top to bottom. The Jets backend is so much better than Edmonton's it's not even funny and while they don't have McDavid, they are far better-balanced upfront and loads of high-end skill of their own.
2003 2018-01-01 18:33:19 I say that because the economy will inevitably take a dive (because the economy is cyclical). It's been propped up by cheap oil these past few years, but that's not going to last
2004 2018-01-01 18:32:40 Well actually Iran is in big trouble which is why they currently have protests everywhere - Canada is an agricultural and industrial country not just oil and you forgot the country most like Indie snp Scotland would be - Venezuela
2005 2018-01-01 18:32:31 Finca Feranza Farm, Ekiti 1, Nigeria.
  20 hectares.
This is a farm that is located in the rainforest region, planted with oil palms as well as a running piggery. The by-products from processed oil palm produce are effectively converted to meat in piggery.
2006 2018-01-01 18:32:20 There's certainly aspects of foreign involvement, including oil and resources, but the problems still run far deeper. It's not just something Western countries caused there either. Doesn't mean we can't do anything. But right now we also have enormous external security risks too.
2007 2018-01-01 18:32:13 Hello friends who oil cleanse . Let me ask you questions
2008 2018-01-01 18:31:59 Sweet almond oil might be giving coconut oil a run for its money
2009 2018-01-01 18:31:56 Well. At least with palm oil your skin weeee shiiiinnnnneee
2010 2018-01-01 18:31:54 Yes and talked about the people there potentially not wanting to be part of an Indy Scotland. You automatically conflate Shetland with oil. Exploitation maybe?
2011 2018-01-01 18:31:42 who is responsible for Iraq situation? just for oil, shame on u
2012 2018-01-01 18:31:41 Brown sugar, vanilla, olive oil.

my stock picks for 2018 & reasons
1.Glencore - inc/growth  - 
copper cobalt  zinc ,Oil  price increases
trading , acquistions - Glasenberg 
2.Bunge - takeover by Glencore - Agriculture play USA market - presently in stand off agreement
2014 2018-01-01 18:31:35 My mama said my oil diffuser smells like piss she just hurt my feelings 
2015 2018-01-01 18:31:32 It's about time world leaders told the truth, it's not a war on terrorism, it's war to get cheap oil and continue to rip off the consumer because the oil companies get it cheaper on the sly and we pay more yet we're the ones whose families are fighting in said scam wars, fucked!
2016 2018-01-01 18:31:20 The KSA is bleeding to death right now. Look at their Oil production trend and their debt accumulation trend.

The massive crack down was about money. The government offer freedom for 70% of their holdings.

The Oil war OPEC started to force out the US failed
2017 2018-01-01 18:31:12 North Sea oil running out only another 15 years left surely you must know this
2018 2018-01-01 18:31:09 Eeeey. I am back in that country that got rich from finding oil. Good to be back home now! All I have to do is wait for my bag to arrive, and then I am really home!
2019 2018-01-01 18:31:05 Woke up to not heat! Oil line frozen, had to have a service call, Happy New Year! 
2020 2018-01-01 18:31:04 Let her come first, we are going everywhere together. If you guys don't want me to go and buy palmoil instead of castor oil 
2021 2018-01-01 18:30:36 forever wishing cars didn’t need oil changes 
2022 2018-01-01 18:30:25 i swear i’m literally addicted to my oil diffuser
2023 2018-01-01 18:30:17 No, Rob. The "top" of the Oiler roster is #97. Nobody on WPG (or any other roster for that matter) comes close. After that...well...it's a mixed bag but it comes down to performance & execution. Nobody actually cares about anything else other than  that.
2024 2018-01-01 18:30:13 What i find ironic about petrol is how we keep having daft wars for oil and yet the price actually INCREASES per litre, which is why it's fucked up, it's OBVIOUS we go for oil. But they don't admit it so they think they can rip us off? We all know! #WarShouldBeCheapOil #Scammers
2025 2018-01-01 18:30:08 Outback, Mufflers, Car Parts, Condiments, Tostitos, Oil Change, Bean Buffet, Call Your Doctor if you experience the following symptoms - bowl names have grown ridiculous.
2026 2018-01-01 18:30:02 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?
2027 2018-01-01 18:29:53 Grilled chicken kebabs are a pretty healty alternative. Donner meat is the worst - about half a pint of oil/grease in one kebab, along with all the ears, eyes and genitals 
2028 2018-01-01 18:29:50 Actually . . . if you follow the history and the money, they are
As is soybean oil, canola oil, GMO wheat, and most dairy
2029 2018-01-01 18:29:46 I just use cantu and coconut oil
2030 2018-01-01 18:29:41 With dwindling global oil prices, the income from oil has reduced and the govt is forced to introduce taxes.
2031 2018-01-01 18:29:38 Happy New Year from all of us at the Colorado Petroleum Council! We are looking forward to 2018 and are excited to see the continued positive impact the Oil & Natural Gas Industry has on Colorado in the new year!
2032 2018-01-01 18:29:36 No unless oil money is dried. Islam won't be allowed to reformed. Muslims must fight hard.
2033 2018-01-01 18:29:31 From the way United is going down, they might discover oil
2034 2018-01-01 18:29:20 ah look at those oil patches underneath the train, beautiful tbh
2035 2018-01-01 18:29:11  I neeed some oil . That's funny
2036 2018-01-01 18:28:51 who knew Olbas oil was to go on ur tissues and not directly up your nose, third degree burns in my left nostril
2037 2018-01-01 18:28:45 Pretty sure I used a #6 and had 4 of 6 candles work made with beeswax and coconut oil. I used 7 day candles as the base.
2038 2018-01-01 18:28:44 I agree with int rates staying low rel to inflation for decades as they did after WW2, this is my catalyst for economic/stock market growth. I’m agnostic re gold but expect oil to stay lowish which implies gold does the same. I also agree that few expect another leg up in gold

2040 2018-01-01 18:28:35 Oil is $2.68 at Walmart and it already comes with a trunk full 
2041 2018-01-01 18:28:34 I work with a guy who’s girlfriend vapes CBD oil for her anxiety and pain she has (I can’t explain cause it’s a personal matter) but if she has a few tokes of her CBD vape and it calms the pain and the anxiety before bed, she uses it daily to help her get out of bed and to
2042 2018-01-01 18:28:31 lmaooo i need an oil change
2043 2018-01-01 18:28:26 The economy has been 100% funded by oil. The government subsidises everything for citizens. The govt budget funding comes from oil and therefore citizens were not taxed
2044 2018-01-01 18:28:24 first meal of 2018 is pastaroni ugh yes ever since i tried the olive oil italian herb one its over for everything else
2045 2018-01-01 18:28:14 I remain perplexed as to why we don't see Draisaitl with Lucic and Slepyshev for at least a handful of games...
2046 2018-01-01 18:28:03 #OOTT | Ineos confirms the Forties Pipeline System is fully operational, operator Ineos AG said Saturday in a statement. All restrictions on the flow of oil and gas from platforms feeding into the pipeline system have been lifted and virtually all platforms are now on line. #WTI
2047 2018-01-01 18:28:00 Prof, I absolutely agree. Told a retired Ass/Chief the same when I bumbed on him at the local market & he asked me whether I would quit my job in SA to work for Uhuruto. It's a simple & firm "NO"! I can never be a snake oil salesman for @UKenyatta @WilliamsRuto @JubileePartyK.
2048 2018-01-01 18:27:56 i feel like an olive swimming innnnnnnnnnnnnnnn......  Oil
2049 2018-01-01 18:27:24 one thing u are good at...it's polarizing shit like oil and water....and then walk away with a grin
2050 2018-01-01 18:27:20 very nice vegan food but too much oil is not healthy. thanks

2058 2018-01-01 18:25:46 Tea tree oil is literal magic lol but it stinks so bad. I’m starting to like the smell tho bc it’s an essential must have for me. Can’t live without it
2059 2018-01-01 18:25:41 It really is. As close to a cure-all as we've seen since Dr. Whosit's Snake Oil. 
2060 2018-01-01 18:25:40 I'd imagined the worst already. If I was taken away, my body would probably on the floor of a military block now, paraded as the body of oil bunkerers or suspected BH that infiltrated Ibafo area on the Twitter page of @HQNigerianArmy & @DefenceInfoNG
2061 2018-01-01 18:25:40 my new years resolution is to trick at least 3 people into thinking i’m an oil painting.
2062 2018-01-01 18:25:15 Oh yeah, U.S. threatening U.N., China & Russia sending oil to North Korea after further sanctions drew unanimous votes, and without U.N. condemnation. There appears to be no unity, no dialogue, and no repercussions. ‘Red Alert’ means what again?
2063 2018-01-01 18:25:09 i love the smell of warmed coconut oil.
2064 2018-01-01 18:25:06 Have you disposed of your Cooking OIl? 
There will be a Cooking Oil Collection Event on Friday, January 5, from 7:30am to 2:30pm, at two convenient drop-off locations:   Francis Field at 25 W. Castillo Dr. and St. Johns County Utilities, Anastasia Island, at 840 W. 16th St.
2065 2018-01-01 18:25:06 Here go the fake bot accounts again. How about going after Russia for sneaking oil into North Korea?

2068 2018-01-01 18:24:45 Oil down with some coconut oil before this bath “slippery”
2069 2018-01-01 18:24:26 Vegetarian Oil Down is NOT Oil Down.
Cho the back and neck and pork in the pot
2070 2018-01-01 18:24:18 @SebAcha Count me in for whatever you need in order to help improve our country in the energy sector. I have 8 years of international experience in the oil and gas industry  @gerardoblancopy
2071 2018-01-01 18:24:16 Iyaaa emang gt kan selsun ada conditioner nya pake itu jg tp dr rambut tengah ke bawah, kalo shampooan bilasnya bener2 sampe bersih bgt pokoknya, hairmask pake pisang+aloevera+coconut oil/olive oil seminggu dua kali, kalo ga hairmask sebelum shampooan pake jeruk nipis didiemin.
2072 2018-01-01 18:24:08 Sounds like way too much spin spa cleansing! Is it the device or is it the cleanser you use? I’ve had mine for years and love it although mine is a different brand. There must be somebody you should go see. In the meantime put some coconut oil on your face.
2073 2018-01-01 18:23:53 @VO5 please tell me the hot oil treatments are coming back? #gutted
2074 2018-01-01 18:23:35 Green salad..romaine lettuce, sprinkling of salt roasted almonds, dried cranberries, paprika (from India, BTW), extra vir olive oil. Tossed. Simple & gentle taste.

Angel hair pasta.. Cooks in 4 min. Feels nice in texture & taste in the mouth. Giggles.

2/2
2075 2018-01-01 18:23:29 all to do with money. City woz nothing what 10-12 years ago. Oil tycoon comes in, spends a fortune and u win a few trophies. A club with no history & only an endless atm. Buying success is not achieving success. ur academy is ruined, no home grown talent will never get a chance.
2076 2018-01-01 18:23:11 Strong oil change mode first day of the year... it should be litty monsoon
2077 2018-01-01 18:23:11 Don't worry. Oil your own machine.
2078 2018-01-01 18:23:11 Oil down to start the year
2079 2018-01-01 18:22:57 Idk why but I see a new front emerging of Pakistan+turkey+Iran against you sir @realDonaldTrump just be aware of these crooks..One feel scare with nuke+nation+oil
2080 2018-01-01 18:22:50 Just like in 1953 when the US overturned a popular & democratically elected Iranian gov at the behest of British oil interests only this time for Israeli election campaign donations
2081 2018-01-01 18:22:23 I like Shaw but he won’t ever make it under Mourinho because his management style and Shaw personality don’t mix at all. Oil and water.
2082 2018-01-01 18:22:23 understand is that we're dealing with the expectation in this vein. The Oil and Gas Commission did a freedom-of-information request was 2/5
2083 2018-01-01 18:22:03 Its an awful and poorly written article mate with zero credence and as unlikely as oil mixing with water! No offence like 
2084 2018-01-01 18:21:41 FUEL QUEUES DISAPPEAR IN ABUJA

I just bought fuel at N145 per litre without queuing in Abuja.

Despite its initial failings, the Nigerian govt led by its oil company, NNPC deserve accolades for the speed at which they handled the fuel crisis. 

But FG must find lasting solution!
2085 2018-01-01 18:21:29 Those look more like oil paintings than photos. I always say they're gorgeous,  but really, they ARE!
2086 2018-01-01 18:21:25 Yup... he’s going after their oil soon. Too bad for all the young Americans that will die to make him and his cronies richer
2087 2018-01-01 18:21:25 Whoa I think I'll pass on coconut oil thanks Dr Oz
2088 2018-01-01 18:21:24 Argon is what I use for barrels. But hey, if you want to do it the ancient way go with olive oil!
2089 2018-01-01 18:21:02 Always about oil with you huh?
2090 2018-01-01 18:20:56 I love fresh's Rose foaming wash! I'll use it after my oil cleansing sometimes to get rid of extra residue. And honestly I couldn't tell you what the brands were! But now that I think back I don't think they were organic
2091 2018-01-01 18:20:38 You aren't no oil painting G......

2094 2018-01-01 18:19:57 The therapist then massages your scalp and face using neroli oil and bitter orange. Afterwards, warm towels are used to wipe off the body mask, leaving your skin smooth and supple. The drift away massage lifts the stress from your muscles.
2095 2018-01-01 18:19:39 Efectivament. Tant la familia rockefeller com la majoria de grans accionistes de Standard Oil van ser els que van seguir controlant Exxon. Però com t'he dit abans no va ser un procès de privatització, sino una fragmentació en base a les lleis anti-trust americanes.
2096 2018-01-01 18:19:22 True well if it was olive oil I would have been on way home at half time
2097 2018-01-01 18:19:18 Yes the LIBLABCON have wasted all the income from North Sea Oil on mass immigration.

2099 2018-01-01 18:19:09 Timmy P's Real Brand Perilla oil! 

Mmmm! 
2100 2018-01-01 18:18:47 I had a dream that I was in a giant college house, and I shared a huge bedroom with @kourtneykardash and @khloekardashian, and @KylieJenner was a roomie in a different room in the house but wasn't talking to any of us b/c she thought we stole her essential oil collection.
2101 2018-01-01 18:18:39 No it's supposed to come kind of crunchy at the non sauced ends, while the sauced parts usually soak in oil from the sauce xD
If you eat it warm it want reach that point, and if you cover it and store it usually stays good 
You can use regular arabic bread n pretend its a taco
2102 2018-01-01 18:18:37 And both have significantly more oil than England which basically has fuck all. That's the real reason the Westminster (90% English) government is fighting tooth and nail to keep Scotland in the UK. We all know this. I suspect you know it too.
2103 2018-01-01 18:18:36 Yes - the issue isn't the use of coal or oil per say, it is the scale of use, which releases sequestered CO2 & other pollutants at a historically unprecedented rate.
2104 2018-01-01 18:18:32 my dad has to do that all the time use baby oil makes it super smooth ;)
2105 2018-01-01 18:18:23 need pin no, how's water and oil, my hair is getting dry
2106 2018-01-01 18:18:11 My husband used to tease me about my vegetarian eating, yoga practicing, oil use and meditating lifestyle...he starts beginner's yoga today and gave up meat a few months ago. I feel like I'm being punked.
2107 2018-01-01 18:18:08 Stidham got baby oil on his cleats or something?
2108 2018-01-01 18:17:57 Did someone put an oil slick down around only Jarrett stidham? I’m so confused what is he slipping on..?
2109 2018-01-01 18:17:44 I doubt any politician alive truly cares about human right violations against Iranians. They only care about resources, in this case it's about oil!
2110 2018-01-01 18:17:43 And no tax reduction without drilling for Arctic oil. Non sequitur much?

2111 2018-01-01 18:17:38 I’m sure you could lose the bacon and just use some sort of oil for the onions/garlic. #vegfriendly
2112 2018-01-01 18:17:37 จำได้เลยว่าวันนั้นตากแดด แดดร้อนมาก เย็นมาฝนตกหนักอีก เปียกกันหมด ทีมงานบอกถอยก่อน เดวไปดูด นุชๆ ไม่เป็นไรค่าไม่ดูดหรอก ดื้อมากไม่ยอมออกกัน เจราจากันนาน จนเฮียทวิตมา บอกนุชเข้าที่ร่มก่อนนะ นุชก็บอกกันถอยเถอะ เฮียทวิตมาบอกให้ถอย พริบตาหายไปทั้งลาน จนท ถึงกะงง ยุ่ดีๆก็พร้อมใจกันถอย
2113 2018-01-01 18:17:33 Get some oil heaters. We only use those in the winter, not our baseboard heating system. They’re much more effective and cost a lot less.
2114 2018-01-01 18:17:31 It also paints a picture of the amount of verbal bullshit that comes from these poeples mouths.Its still the safest way to transport oil...
2115 2018-01-01 18:17:24 "Much work to be done" but you'd rather be golfing or bad mouthing countries like #China selling #Oil to #NK...oh Oops, it was #Russia. When are you going to bad mouth #Putin for doing that?
2116 2018-01-01 18:17:17 Preceding the spa's 3-hour signature treatment is a lavender foot soak,scrub & rosemary hair massage.The session begins with a harmonizing body scrub made up of mineral salt,eucalyptus & lavender oil.A lavender,bergamot & mandarin gel mask is applied before wrapping your body.

2119 2018-01-01 18:17:01 More mess left behind by the oil companies
2120 2018-01-01 18:16:56 The merry-go-round is endless...started with getting rid of Renney far sooner than he should have been shown the door.
2121 2018-01-01 18:16:55 Not come across that before. The oil drums, that is - the Great War had its fair share of medievalism...
2122 2018-01-01 18:16:38 I should get an oil change today but will I? probably not.
2123 2018-01-01 18:15:52 Norway nationalized their oil too. Are their citizens being encouraged to kill their dogs and eat them by the govt?
2124 2018-01-01 18:15:49 My skin is so dry that even super hydrating lotion with baby oil still isn’t enough. I still have dry itchy patches. 
2125 2018-01-01 18:15:46 Started off 2018 with: oil change for Jax, full tank of gas, cleaned the apartment, clean laundry, got a workout in, cooked lunch, prepping chicken wings.  It's gonna be a damn good year y'all. I've been up since 8am. #ItsTooColdDoe
2126 2018-01-01 18:15:30 I’m almost done tbh I got the oil pan and cover on
2127 2018-01-01 18:15:28 @budshaw The best thing for Browns fans is Haslem getting indicted  for his oil scam and we get a new owner..

2130 2018-01-01 18:15:06 I don't have anything to fry. So in a baking plate, with some oil, and foil on top. It's still ok when you're craving for fries.
2131 2018-01-01 18:15:05 *shaking* NOT ALL IS LOST JULIE GET THE CLEANSING OIL AND REGULAR CLEANSER. DO A DOUBLE CLEANSE. BREAK OUT THE MOISTURIZER YOU’LL BE OKAY!!!
2132 2018-01-01 18:15:04 My forehead and chin isn’t oily. My nose sometimes a tiny bit of oil and sometimes dry that it peels near the tip.  But blackhead galore sigh. So idk..TMI but I currently have a pimple at the side of my nose lol and it hurts but it’s hormonal. On my period now

....... The most interesting fact about this is that
They did this in just 2years.
2136 2018-01-01 18:14:33 I’m confused are you trying to say the oil spill didn’t happen? There are pictures on the internet. It was pretty horrible.
2137 2018-01-01 18:14:33 基本年始でしか帰らないのでそこに合わせて注文してくれるのですよね
美味しかったです(*･ω･)
2138 2018-01-01 18:14:29 as in, the olive oil acting as a liquid cork?  I've heard about wine bottled being filled with CO2 for this purpose, but I didn't know olive oil could do the same
2139 2018-01-01 18:14:26 Another Top 10 would be that time we invaded Iraq because Dick Cheney wanted some oil.

2143 2018-01-01 18:13:46 I'm celebrating New Years in Montana but still cooking cornbread in my black iron skillet.  Been advised to "use oil and let it roll over the sides of the cornmeal like love handles over tight blue jeans".  Next chapter, how to get rid of love handles...
2144 2018-01-01 18:13:33 He’s obviously referring to Israel’s illegal occupation of Golan Heights where Murdoch, Cheney and Rothschild are drilling for oil and their constant support for AQ-ISIS against the Syrian State
2145 2018-01-01 18:13:32 Presently Asian stocks are best, but lately got S&P 500 buy. Palladium, Gasoil, Brent crude, Heating Oil are other components right now.

2148 2018-01-01 18:13:28 Many renewables are now viable without subsidy e.g.  North Sea oil has plenty of tax subsidy as does nuclear, renewable whole life  co2 emissions are not what article reflects etc we're on a journey to improve energy and this just the start
2149 2018-01-01 18:13:21 Norway has 3x the oil Scotland has. Look can I help it if Scotland has a high spending habit, take it up with Sturgeon. Cut your cloth.
2150 2018-01-01 18:13:12 Clearly, you and your colleagues control the weather, which, in turn, means you've conspired to give us this cold weather (probably in league with oil and gas companies).
2151 2018-01-01 18:13:11 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for vaginal jade eggs, and put some aloe essential oil in my diffuser.

you haven't seen this girl in over a week. you Know she doesn't have a kitchen. she buys a bottle of oil from you and then disappears
2162 2018-01-01 18:11:55 Why doesn't my car insurance cover oil changes and new tires??  If I want to change my car's color I have to pay.  But if I want to change my gender everybody around me has to pay???

2168 2018-01-01 18:11:32 The doctor gave me peppermint oil  tablets for my IBS but neglected to warn me they make your poo smell like mint.
2169 2018-01-01 18:11:30 Pretty sure oil is magic and why has it taken me so long to use it as skincare?
2170 2018-01-01 18:11:27 I've been doing this aloe vera and coconut oil thing for my face for a week now. The results

2178 2018-01-01 18:10:09 With both, I just half wash the conditioner out. With the Shea Moisture, sometimes I put the masque on while the conditioner is still on and half wash that out. But if your hair is coming out dry just try detangling with oil after your wash your hair to seal moisture.

2180 2018-01-01 18:09:32 The whole 50-50 splitting of profits by producing countries & oil companies was breaking down. The countries that tried to go it alone (e.g. Mexico) didn't do as well; those that let in modern oil expertise did better. Leaving Mosaddegh in place would have been better for all.

2185 2018-01-01 18:09:03 Do you you magnesium oil? It’s so good. Couple of sprays and it does wonders! Try it if you haven’t. I’ve ran out of chocolates now so I’m really feeling to fuck this yr off xx
2186 2018-01-01 18:08:54 They based Scotland’s future on oil!
2187 2018-01-01 18:08:48 I never use real leave ins lol. My number one is Not Your Mother’s Naturals - coconut milk & African Marula Tree Oil (blue bottle) and I also really like Shea Moisture manuka honey & mafura oil (brown bottle).
2188 2018-01-01 18:08:43 Every policy our President has implemented and pushed hurts Russia will you stop being so simple minded. Increased oil and natural gas production. Approved weapons sales to Ukraine. Etc.....  all very detrimental to Russia
2189 2018-01-01 18:08:28 Truth indeed rather alleviates than hurts, and will always bear up against falsehood, as oil does above water. -Miguel de Cervantes
2190 2018-01-01 18:08:07 My only New Year resolution is to use my Coconut Oil and Witch Hazel around my eyes dailySomedays I forget.
2191 2018-01-01 18:08:06 Supposedly the high saturated fat content of the creamery butter and coconut oil give you a lot of protein and curb hunger -jury still out on that
2192 2018-01-01 18:08:05 Not exactly pouring oil on troubled waters is he? Hasn't there been enough death already?
2193 2018-01-01 18:08:03 Jus salty I have to wear a ponytail and pretty much not even touch my hair for it to grow + coconut oil, Biotin shampoo & Follicure lol

2196 2018-01-01 18:07:31 Scotland's future was based on $115 a barrel.
Since the oil price crash we've handed over even more tax credits for companies to stay with the N Sea, and now we have decommisioning costs too.
This leaves a £10b hole in Scotland's public finances, oil was never a bonus
2197 2018-01-01 18:07:18 Trump will “help” Iran...like Putin “helped” Crimea

Sanctions won’t go away, so they’re flipping to Flynn’s Plan B:

Russia runs dozen or so nuclear energy plants (& grabs oil) in Iran & US guards them, to pay back for help w election

They’ll feign unity in fighting ISIS, too
2198 2018-01-01 18:06:53 The jobs that have left were years ago as a result of the Crash in Oil in 2014. There are currently 30,000 unfilled jobs in Alberta right now. The doom and gloom that you are whining about only exists in your minds. You may be able to suck in your dimwitted followers but not us!
2199 2018-01-01 18:06:44 Did you happen to notice the economies of any of the other oil states (Norway, Iran, Canada) crashing when the oil price dipped Keith? No, because for most countries oil, even tho the price does fluctuate, is a massive bonus. Except for in Scotland where it's a curse, apparently.
2200 2018-01-01 18:06:36 No.  They’re called “oil balls.” The Dutch don’t try to make goodies sound healthy!

2203 2018-01-01 18:05:55 Need to get an oil change today 
2204 2018-01-01 18:05:36 btw. 2002, 2003. what exactly were people really doing in iraq?
I know about the tv-show generation kill from @hbo 

but. for real. business acquisition oil fields? real estate getting a new palace for personal use? for real. @swisslife_ch did you like had stuff insured there?
2205 2018-01-01 18:05:34 Having Trump as president wasn't just going in reverse. It was also putting sugar in the gas and sand in the motor oil.
2206 2018-01-01 18:05:27 Please stop the importation of crude oil.
2207 2018-01-01 18:05:17 อ้วนก็น่ารักคัลปม
2208 2018-01-01 18:05:13 Standard Oil no es va privatitzar mai ja que mai va ser una empresa pública. El govern la va trossejar (essent ja privada) i repartir entre els accionistes perquè pel que sembla, la mà invisible sembla que no funcionava gaire bé per a evitar el monopoli del petroli.
2209 2018-01-01 18:05:02 Paying refiners $1.20 for gas when oil is only $60/barrel is the true inconvenience. Same price when oil hit $120/barrel.Yeah yeah...take off the taxes. Less 30% constant.
2210 2018-01-01 18:04:28 Bio oil do ur thang pls 
2211 2018-01-01 18:04:22 Pakistan has more than enough  $$ time we start getting our own oil from home or help someone else who don't lie harbor terrorist cells

I am mostly coil.
2214 2018-01-01 18:04:02 Communism, sure. Social democracy is more moral than the US. If your talking of Venezuelan Socialism, most things were fine before the oil crash
2215 2018-01-01 18:04:01 Oh come on, man. No Schieffle or Buff. I mean...yes...WPG is a better team...because they're more committed/better prepared & confident in their systems....not because of what they put on paper 15 minutes before the game. They've been better Game to Game, all year, for sure.
2216 2018-01-01 18:03:50 Hopefully you will have access soon.
I have witnessed CBD oil do wonders for epilepsy. 29 states have passed MMJ laws so hopefully more will follow suit and you can give it a shot.
The mark up of life saving meds is insane. And unethical. I hope that changes soon.

2221 2018-01-01 18:03:33 Wow! You do use it quickly. Make sure you're buying it from a reputable source. Lots of olive oil fraud out there - mixing a little olive oil with cheaper oils.
2222 2018-01-01 18:03:28 I agree but rose hip seed oil is an exception, for me at least. I have used 4 brands and all but the expensive 1 broke me out/didn't see results from. It makes sense that the more organic and less processed a product is, the better it will be, the higher the price
2223 2018-01-01 18:03:23 Trump should know about "lies and deceit," he's the master!  Trump, wouldn't they give you their oil and minerals rights to your cronies?

2227 2018-01-01 18:02:42 TSX poised to eke out gains in 2018, despite uncertainty over NAFTA and oil
2228 2018-01-01 18:02:27 my mom gone say “that car need a oil change” like just tell me to take it to get the oil changed and it’ll be done lol
2229 2018-01-01 18:02:11 The soldiers during WWII were not fighting for oil.  They were fighting tyranny.  Found dead in an alley?  Does anybody know what happened and why?  Racial killing?

2232 2018-01-01 18:01:51 When will Nigeria stop depending on importation of crude oil? This is a new year @Mbuhari. Please appoint a capable #MFP
2233 2018-01-01 18:01:44 How many people know that US & Britain facilitated the partition in 1947 for oil reserves in Pakistan? India was Russia friendly while Pak was US friendly. Politics is tricky!  #TrumpDumpsPak
2234 2018-01-01 18:01:33 I want to point out though, that both of our perspectives are leading to the same belief: clean house.
2235 2018-01-01 18:01:20 There is a very big valid excuse : MONEY. Most oil rich nations are islamic. If the UN moves against them, they will pull the oil levers to throw the world into chaos, not to mention that the UN will also lose funding.
2236 2018-01-01 18:01:17 Yes! Especially the castor oil
2237 2018-01-01 18:01:16 They don't care about you...they only care about the Middle East for OIL!  Shit, they don't even care about the AMERICANS in PR!!!
2238 2018-01-01 18:01:10 Castor oil
2239 2018-01-01 18:00:43 No not a soldier just an ordinary kid.. Left in n alley one March night. I don't see fighting on war a heroic act where war is for the gain of oil.. Everyone whio lives their life and strives to better themselves refuting retribution this are the true heroes
2240 2018-01-01 18:00:43 not turned since 79 flushed the sump out oil and filter change , bleed the system off and boom! first crack up she went , you park your car up over xmas and cant get it started without a laptop! 
2241 2018-01-01 18:00:11 May 2018 be the year of yumminess! We're kicking it off with this colorfully fresh tuna "poke" bowl by @healthypieceofpie

2243 2018-01-01 18:00:00 #DidYouKnow that Olive Oil helps reduce the appearance of constipation. Include it in your meals and you start to have a healthier life!
2244 2018-01-01 17:59:40 No problem! In the mean time, you can try getting some salmon oil or something for skin/coat from the pet store and add it to her food, just in case this is more dry skin itching. (It won't hurt if it isn't.)
2245 2018-01-01 17:59:39 "It's...beard...oil" 
What a brilliant line from @FreeFireMovie
2246 2018-01-01 17:59:36 Yep I think the UK case is stronger than ever or did you not notice the oil price collapse? Yup same to you.
2247 2018-01-01 17:59:12 Long time abusers of sugar, olive oil, diet coke, and television may act in a similar manner
2248 2018-01-01 17:59:08 do who know of the coup of 1956?.... for oil.....BP
2249 2018-01-01 17:59:08 Isn't this a detail in the fight to remove cars from the world (stop burning oil, chopping forests, etc)? So yes, let's ban them all.  #Gaia
2250 2018-01-01 17:58:54 @FarahMaalimM bad time of the year for the oil crisis
2251 2018-01-01 17:58:31 Who else appointed himself @MBuhari to personally control the oil of the country and create extreme wealth for himself and his party @APCNigeria
2252 2018-01-01 17:58:31 Simple oil of cloves...
2253 2018-01-01 17:58:28 Being talked at... in any form... really doesn’t gel well with me at all. Like oil in water

2257 2018-01-01 17:58:06 正解できた
2258 2018-01-01 17:57:55 snowflakes are so upset that we are drilling for oil.
2259 2018-01-01 17:57:41 You might see it as an Injustice, and it might be (especially if you are right). But he doesn't affect the salary cap and a new coach often brings a new philosophy. It's worth testing if that works, and it often does.

McLellan wouldn't be the first coach to feel the sting
2260 2018-01-01 17:56:55 That's nice that they disagree. The truth is that Canada is a petroleum based economy. Alberta is whet a lot of that oil is. Alberta has more than 200 000 unemployed people. There are 4.4 m people living here. How good could the economy be if there are 200k adults without jobs?

2263 2018-01-01 17:56:25 I'm from upstate NY and can find Lucas Oil without GPS now that I've been by it a handful of times.

2265 2018-01-01 17:56:10 Head-shaking recipe moment: Tortilla Espanola. “Heat potatoes in 2 cups Olive Oil”. Are you insane?! That’s like $10 worth of OO!
2266 2018-01-01 17:56:03 i’ve always wanted to try that foundation but i’ve heard it’s super drying!! have u added a face oil to it?
2267 2018-01-01 17:56:00 Happy New Year!
Now back to trying to dealing w/ frozen pipes & heating oil.
SMH-better not be a sign of things to come for 2018!
2268 2018-01-01 17:55:56 100% chocolate, mixed with 4x volume of Coconut oil and a little erythritol syrup, and optionally chopped nuts or seeds solves the chocolate problem. Very low CHO
2269 2018-01-01 17:55:21 Your in denial bout where Quebec gets oil. Check National Energy Bd files. BTW the 47 people died in  Que rail explosion died in USA N Dakota Rail Oil but that’s better than the odd pipeline spill or do you deny that too! Where do Feds get the money they give to “have not” Quebec
2270 2018-01-01 17:55:13 เขินนนน
2271 2018-01-01 17:55:06 Just tryna get my oil change and go back to the house! It’s cold out here chief! 
2272 2018-01-01 17:55:03 This peppermint oil smells good.
2273 2018-01-01 17:54:52 El què i el com,per a mí,tots dos.
Pots privatitzar trocejant abans (Standard Oil)  per a fomentar la compretència.
2274 2018-01-01 17:54:35 Doesn’t sound like much, but this was well before social media or any of that. Seeing soooo many animals covered in crude oil and struggling honestly still haunts me.
2275 2018-01-01 17:54:33 The key is to basically say "No" right away and calmly, plainly explain why he's selling snake oil and not the gold-plated wonder he claims to be. 

Then when he attacks you -- weak, mean, whatever -- you roll with it. "Yeah, I can be. Especially toward you, when you deserve it."
2276 2018-01-01 17:54:10 I've been out in a warehouse and desert for the past two weeks and I finally have time to make myself feel normal. What to I do. Drench myself in olive oil.
2277 2018-01-01 17:54:10 25 minutes on 250 degrees heat to cook frozen fries with microwave. No oil needed. Just put it on an iron lid!
2278 2018-01-01 17:54:07 U should try them cooked in coconut oil and coated in vegan parmesan! Not the healthiest but really good!
2279 2018-01-01 17:53:59 Hardly. India survives on crude oil. And Saudi ambassador was specifically lobbying India before vote. Sorry to say but Arabs have India by the balls until India switches to solar power and electric cars
2280 2018-01-01 17:53:46 After every night out.....I scrub my face with Cetaphil to remove all excess dirt amd make up, put on a mask to soothe it and then apply coconut oil to add the moisture back to my skin...you gotta look after your face girl
2281 2018-01-01 17:53:41 All my tires tweaking now I gotta go to an oil change place and let them fill these mfs up
2282 2018-01-01 17:53:00 I smell like oil but my car has been serviced!! I’m only wearing a little bit of it too!

I think…haven’t checked my back yet x3
2283 2018-01-01 17:52:46 Pray tell with a 64 seat deficit on the Tories and the fix parliament act, what Tory in there right mind ( maybe sozzlebry) would chance a election yet. Get real you old fake snake oil salesman, your never going to get a look inside No10. Agh, as abbot done your seat count
2284 2018-01-01 17:52:41 I'll just eat coconut oil lol
2285 2018-01-01 17:52:35 Oh, but he needs a real physical war now, one with better chances of winning without blowing up the world. And oil!
2286 2018-01-01 17:52:33  Libra: On Monday locally brewed beer and oil trickle into the pancake but lights sparkle on the horizon.
2287 2018-01-01 17:52:31 Gf flour and oil! It worked well, though it didn’t get quite as brown as I would have liked, even though I spend an hour on it
2288 2018-01-01 17:52:19 Agenda for today
Visit dad and get essential oil blood pressure care kit.
Go to crystal fox and get more essential sleep oil and moms Christmas gift
Maybe movie....cause that's relaxing and maybe warm
2289 2018-01-01 17:52:18 I know that was rhetorical, but past generations may have ignored mental health issues to some degree. The snake oil salesmen are going to make BIG bank preying on millennials.
2290 2018-01-01 17:51:35 $55 for an oil change. I’m sick 
2291 2018-01-01 17:51:16 Some natural source vitamin E & omega fish oil might help. Helps with inflammation.
2292 2018-01-01 17:50:44 ところでマンガでわかるFGOがなんやかんやで展開先取りしてるっていうか「カルデア」っていう施設は放棄するはめになってるんだよね

2294 2018-01-01 17:50:28 Last night was an oil boon
2295 2018-01-01 17:50:27 Me and two other students traveled to the coasts of the most impacted islands. We sectioned off quadrants of the beach, counted and cataloged every tiny sea creature, even every barnacle. We also rescued birds and washed oil of otters and such.

2299 2018-01-01 17:50:02 Even PM Modi is silent. Understandle given the geopolitics and strategic value of Iran to India: Oil and Gas, Access to Afghanistan, Central Asia, Russia and Europe
2300 2018-01-01 17:49:58 Our oil meter has apparently been reading wrong and it ran out even tho the meter says it’s half full lmao this is Fine
2301 2018-01-01 17:49:53 Konon nak burn the midnight oil. Dah la pompuan. Baik kau balik, tido. Esok exam kan?? Sebab tu konon nak stay up. Buat tambah dosa aku je dengar kau mengumpat
2302 2018-01-01 17:49:23 ゴルドルフ新所長はやっぱヒロインだよ……おなかをもにゅもにゅさせろ……
2303 2018-01-01 17:49:23 One of the most important cooking skills (in my opinion): how to cook a good tomato sauce. It‘s so simple and a good foundation for Lasagne, Pasta or Pizza. 

Just stew some onions in olive oil, use cherry tomatos and tomato paste. The longer you let it cook, the better.
2304 2018-01-01 17:49:04 Yes, but you believed this roster was capable of far more than me and hence why we see things differently. Have a tough time blaming the coach when he isn't given a full deck of cards to work with and expected to deliver a contending team.
2305 2018-01-01 17:49:02 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
2306 2018-01-01 17:48:46 
2307 2018-01-01 17:48:31 Absolument faux, vu l'avalanche de taxes supplémentaires que le gouvernement a voté. Prenez l'exemple du gas oil pour un ouvrier qui va au boulot en voiture. Regardez la liste des taxes supplémentaires et faites votre calcul personnel et on en reparle après d'accord !!!
2308 2018-01-01 17:48:08 and that would be the goal. There is no reason why oil that is not for us and does not originate in our country
2309 2018-01-01 17:48:02 How fortuitous then @LordTebbit that both Cuba and Venezuela have #BluePassports Where did all that Money from the North Sea Oil go, Norway still has theirs and they're spending it wisely for the benefit of their Nation, didn't happen here in the UK, and I think you know why...
2310 2018-01-01 17:48:00 Multi engine planes are designed to fly with one engine shutdown. It was shutdown as precaution due to low oil pressure. Porter has a good record. As inconvenient this is for the passengers it appears to be a routine engine issue and diversion.
2311 2018-01-01 17:47:27 Here's what happened:
Trump&Co: "You help me become president, get in White House, forgive our Russian held debt. We'll lift sanctions, open up oil reserves, etc..we'll make billions

Putin&Co: OK...

Just horns and a tail and eyes as black as an oil slick, all of it serving to just make her look slimy and in all likelihood more than a little disgusting. And at any other time with any other person she would be proud of >
2313 2018-01-01 17:47:20 You could use some art on your walls.  Oil paintings and the like.  Happy New Year!
2314 2018-01-01 17:47:16 I would discard most of them after 6 months. However, you can extend the shelf life up to a year by refrigerating or freezing them. Coconut oil you can actually store for several years since the fats aren't prone toward oxidation.
2315 2018-01-01 17:47:11 To all my South Carolina people, y’all keep your receipts for gas and oil changes to file for next years tax refunds ! We get tax credit now for them
2316 2018-01-01 17:47:05 that's funny....honey?

i'm watching your picture. sad.
2317 2018-01-01 17:47:03 I can’t believe my tea tree oil is almost done. No. I shall not start the new year like this
2318 2018-01-01 17:47:02 He claims opening the Artic Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling an achievement...wow! Same time, under deregulation, mining run off in Alaska threatens the worlds largest wild Salmon runs. Big business profits and people put at risk...& republicans don't care
2319 2018-01-01 17:47:01 O.k. thanks i don't want sweet o. Maybe i should just put it ìn oil n pepper mix then bake or grill
2320 2018-01-01 17:46:55 I mean I have the loge seats at rogers place for the oil kings game today. Starting the year of right?!
2321 2018-01-01 17:46:54 China is selling oil to NK in violation of sanctions while KN is threatening millions of ppl Seoul and Japan. #China is no friend of ours. Buy US Made.
2322 2018-01-01 17:46:26 yes they are disgusting snake oil salesmen but there are people who will believe anything
2323 2018-01-01 17:46:18 If I remember correctly, Shetland wouldn't be able to claim the oil fields anyway. But that's not the point, if the people of Shetland expressed a desire to leave Scotland they should have the right to express it.
2324 2018-01-01 17:45:44 Brandon's daily self-baptism in a drum of olive oil…to remain slick.
2325 2018-01-01 17:45:42 Baby Oil is mandatory all 2018!
2326 2018-01-01 17:45:19 Je fais le plein de gas oil toutes les semaines : 7,6 cts de taxe supplémentaires du litre X 60 Litres X 52 semaines = 237.12 euros de perte de pouvoir d'achat !!!
2327 2018-01-01 17:45:03 In search of an essential oil that will ward away essential oil salesmen
2328 2018-01-01 17:44:56 GEN X: I'll show you how to change the oil.
MILLENIAL DOUCHE: Sheh, I can YouTube it.
GX: Want to hit the gym?

2331 2018-01-01 17:44:48 Sure, I’ll take some sesame seeds and grapeseed oil. Feeling the need for some tahini in my day.
2332 2018-01-01 17:44:44 My favorite moisturizers are full of grace serum by lush and hope in a jar by philosophy! Any organic rose hip seed oil will work. If it's really cheap it's probably not good unfortunately! Lily of the Dessert aloe as well!
2333 2018-01-01 17:44:23 I see a problem with allowing people to take unproven medicines if it costs either them or the healthcare system a dime. That leads to snake oil salesmen. May be you're not old enough to remember Laetrile.
2334 2018-01-01 17:44:21 My dad just mistakenly dropped my whole tub of coconut oil  yoh my entire beauty regimen 
2335 2018-01-01 17:43:53 Cozy bed, warm coffee, Netflix and and my new essential oil diffuser 
2336 2018-01-01 17:43:47 To the folks who stole my heating oil over Christmas I hope you needed it more than I did. Happy New Year.

2338 2018-01-01 17:43:31 Well Mia I'm going to say like I said before the American people are the problem the United States want control of Yemen because it a port area that controls the flow of oil by putting in a puppet
2339 2018-01-01 17:43:17 He’s going to pay me back for that oil, by giving me all kinds of affection and cuteness while I re extract the oil. Needs to be at least cute enough for me to forgive him >w>
2340 2018-01-01 17:43:15 FTR: Roster moves I would make next season? 
- Keep 3 Centers (last season I would have traded RNH).
- Upgrade backup goalie
- Upgrade speed and shooting on the left wing, preferably top line
- Find someone resembling Torey Krug to play defense.

2348 2018-01-01 17:42:27 You. 

Do you have any idea how difficult it was to extract that oil >_>
2349 2018-01-01 17:42:19 You apparently aren’t aware that US & Western Capitalists used its geopolitical clout to sabotage Venezuela’s economy after Chavez vowed to keep Venezuela’s oil nationalized. Like Saddam & so many others, Chavez found NOBODY bucks US Imperalism & survives, civilians included.
2350 2018-01-01 17:42:00 They don't have oil.
2351 2018-01-01 17:41:48 Elf has a good one that I think is cruelty free? Otherwise just about everything is going to be coconut oil/milk based

2354 2018-01-01 17:41:21 Using the same quote tell me about that oil and wrist bundles he is selling, where does it fit in there that scripture you have quoted?
2355 2018-01-01 17:41:18 Bibi N covers his bases. If tRump cannot steal Iranian Oil for him. Turmoil in Iran enough distractions for him to brutalize the Palestinians. Bibi N single goal is tRump's goal to Exterminate their "Others" If they were to succeed the 
problem both would then need new enemies!
2356 2018-01-01 17:41:01 If you can't see this is going to be an excuse for sending in US troops because there is one thing it has and the US wants and that is "Oil" and the US wants to control it.

* Dismantle White Supremacy
* Resist Null Hypothesis Testing
* Make the scientific process ACCOUNTABLE, OPEN, and REPRODUCIBLE
* Avoid palm oil

2359 2018-01-01 17:40:45 Just read that the expensive oil Mary blessed Jesus w when she washed him w her tears was the same bottle of oil Jesus' own foreskin was preserved in.
2360 2018-01-01 17:40:38 So, daughter says I "might" have an oil leak. Pulled the dipstick no oil present. Soooooooo 7 degrees outside draining oil checking for metal particles. Think we are good, about 3.5 quarts came out. Why can't this happen when it is around 60 degrees? Happy New Year!
2361 2018-01-01 17:40:24 Creambath makarizoooo, sama pake hair serum oilnya loreal. Oil tapi ga berminyak bikin lepek gt kok, tenanggg
2362 2018-01-01 17:40:18 The oil filled radiators.
2363 2018-01-01 17:40:15 Who sells oil @OpenVAPE cartridges?? I need a. 
2364 2018-01-01 17:40:09 My oil diffuser has completely replaced my candle and incense obsession  especially since I can fall asleep with it on and take it to work
2365 2018-01-01 17:40:09 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
2366 2018-01-01 17:40:07 If you ......oil and water together, water doesn't stay up.
2367 2018-01-01 17:39:57 Cleaned the whole crib. Incense burning. Coconut oil all on my scalp. Can’t nobody stop me right now 
2368 2018-01-01 17:39:50 pake loreal extraordinary oil coba
2369 2018-01-01 17:39:42 What Iran has is civilisation with law & order. When that breaks down. All hell breaks loose. Civilians die & cities are destroyed. Iraqi people did not get the vote. Oil barons feared they'd loose oil revenue to the people. It's called giving the people democracy
2370 2018-01-01 17:39:39 i just successfully calmed myself down using mindfulness techniques, deep breathing, and aromatherapy w/ lavender essential oil. mental illness who?????? i don’t know her
2371 2018-01-01 17:39:25 The fact that Chiarelli has deprived us of answering this difference of opinion with data (same team, different coach) is grounds for removal. He is putting his relationships above the teams success.

2380 2018-01-01 17:38:50 This coquito vape oil is sooooo good.
2381 2018-01-01 17:38:49 Let's hope the year is well lubricated  like last year @Graves_MSport @Lucas_Oil
2382 2018-01-01 17:38:43 When your money is involved, how won't you use three exclamation marks
2383 2018-01-01 17:38:39 Gloria Allred the glorified oil digging ambulance-chasing fact flipping word raping wannabe pretender Council. In fact every client the woman has should wear a harness,so they are not led around anymore by their noses. This is just my opinion mind you.
2384 2018-01-01 17:38:29 So I hear your feelings about the roster. Personally, I think it could be coaching (on top of a need for obvious improvements on offensive d-core), but we will never know because Chiarelli has deprived us of the opportunity (likely out of self preservation or a favor to McLellan)
2385 2018-01-01 17:38:23 Why didn’t you also say that Russia against U.N. sanction agreement also sold N.Korea oil? Putin scares us also.
2386 2018-01-01 17:38:20 Oil rich UK.... Thatcher sold North Sea Oil to all her mates
2387 2018-01-01 17:38:00 A ridiculous minimum wage hike takes place in Ontario today, you all can thank the @liberal_party & the worst Premier ever @Kathleen_Wynne as to why our shop labour rates and oil change prices are going up tomorrow when we get to work.
2388 2018-01-01 17:37:56 What is a good #vegan or #CrueltyFree moisturizer that isn’t just coconut oil?  Having issues finding one...
2389 2018-01-01 17:37:38 Well I am glad it works well for buying your hot sauce, beard oil, and hip hop beats.  Have a good day sir!
2390 2018-01-01 17:37:36 almost a week ago I bought the cheapest hair oil I could find in a crocery store and I've been using it since then and now my hair doesn't get as oily as it used to in one day
2391 2018-01-01 17:37:22 To hell with your aid, we don't need any. It's US who attacked countries in the name of terrorism, rob all their wealth (gold, oil everything) & then keep giving little help to the ppl whose wealth they have looted.

2392 2018-01-01 17:37:10 Maybe they around some petty ass oil places  yeah they’ll do it just pull up to the door instead of going around like you getting a oil change
2393 2018-01-01 17:36:52 LMAO! Okay, everybody, breathe. Castor Oil and Vitamin E () we got this.
2394 2018-01-01 17:36:48 Have to get a oil change
2395 2018-01-01 17:36:41 Filled with sweet, sweet crude oil.
2396 2018-01-01 17:36:40 Dick head was in the first car wash slot and as I’m pulling in he moves over two slots to the one I need to use. You fucking cunt I hope your truck explodes because you haven’t changed the oil on that thing and i can smell it.
2397 2018-01-01 17:36:32 just drink canola oil.
2398 2018-01-01 17:36:24 Liberaron el precio justo cuando el OIL estaba en zona de rebote y nosotros tenemos un TC muy atrasado... No esperen que se detengan las subas. A veces creo q no les importa la inflación.
2399 2018-01-01 17:36:20 The only state fully controlled by the ijaws, so sad with the state of development once oil become a thing of the past beyelsa will be so poor even the banana plantations wouldn't be able to feed the kinsmen.
2400 2018-01-01 17:36:02 We aren't having this discussion because, to me, you make decisions based on where you sit in the standings. Vanilla NHL GM 101 playbook says you fire the coach when there is this dramatic a regression. I think Chiarelli stalled to give his guy extra rope.
2401 2018-01-01 17:35:59 @manjitminhas Good U R not involved in Dragon quantum entanglement scam: it is high tech snake oil, at best self-delusion of company, at worst fraud. Dragons even said "too good to be true" "I don't believe it"; yet still fell for it. Happy 2018!

2404 2018-01-01 17:35:39 We have led the way on divesting our City’s pension’s funds from places that hurt New Yorkers — like gun retailers and oil companies that pollute our air.
2405 2018-01-01 17:35:27 More importantly, what does Iran have that the U.S. might want?  Iran is ranked as the second largest economy in the Middle East and North Africa.  Apart from oil and natural gas, their other natural resources are coal, chromium, copper, iron ore, lead, manganese, zinc, sulphur.
2406 2018-01-01 17:35:19 Actually, they are buying American steel for the TransCanada line from the heavy oil pits to Tulsa. They had to reopen some coal mines to provide enough coal to manufacture that much steel. MAGA
2407 2018-01-01 17:35:16 JAJAJAJAse tiene que repetirrrrrr.... Menos eso de pasarnos de ypf a la oil y luego la terminal
2408 2018-01-01 17:35:08 oil to go into North Korea. There will never be reported correctly by the Trump Campaign! Was @foxandfriends just
2409 2018-01-01 17:35:04 Try waterproof makeup remover or oil to remove your Velvetine. 
2410 2018-01-01 17:34:58 I have a question. Have u heard of a night musk oil!
2411 2018-01-01 17:34:55 Wait, it's no longer oil anymore now it's capsules that need squeezing? *sigh*
2412 2018-01-01 17:34:47 I left coconut oil in my hair for a couple of days and its sooooo soft and amazing
2413 2018-01-01 17:34:39 I say lets end the oil and gas subsidies instead ...
2414 2018-01-01 17:34:38 vape oil. Please I must see
2415 2018-01-01 17:34:34 need to go buy some more beard oil 
2416 2018-01-01 17:34:30 moisturizer is clinique moisture surge it’s a gel so it dries matte n serum is the body shop tea tree oil it also dries v v matte 10/10
2417 2018-01-01 17:34:16 Is that a sign that oil wells are drying up forcing UAE to diversify it's budgetary income? Seeing relentless ads encouraging tourism  in Emirates. In Kenya The VAT rate is 16%.
2418 2018-01-01 17:34:12 Yeah, you got it. The scientists are all about the big bucks. And the oil companies are all about a brighter future for us all
2419 2018-01-01 17:34:04 I’m waiting for @realDonaldTrump to criticize Russia for allowing oil tankers to go to North Korea.
2420 2018-01-01 17:33:52 LOL. Not at the moment. I’ll let you know when I’m back. To be clear, we can get the vitamin E capsules and squeeze out the oil, right? Right?
2421 2018-01-01 17:33:38 Hopefully less dependence on oil prices and more political freedoms...
2422 2018-01-01 17:33:31 Last day on the oil, LFC scrape 3pts #HappyNewYear2018 
2423 2018-01-01 17:33:27 The Establishment is sh!ting its pants right now --- 2018 is the year they will REALLY be exposed for what they are.  No more propping up corrupt, evil regimes just for the oil!

2427 2018-01-01 17:32:26 Your version of greatness means polluted water, polluted air, oil drilling risk, raping and pillaging our national lands, and lining the pockets of the filthy rich. Plus making life harsher for anyone of color.
2428 2018-01-01 17:32:03 Stop the money time for Pakistan to grow up and produce there own income from oil! I say stop the flow!
2429 2018-01-01 17:32:00 I'm just thinking there would be more waste generated, more oil used to create the plastics, more energy used to truck the bottles, etc.
2430 2018-01-01 17:31:56 Olive oil ice-cream  Who comes up with such hey!??
2431 2018-01-01 17:31:50 Or. Honestly you can just do the castor oil and vitamin E. Castor oil is magic for hair and skin. Vitamin E softens and protects the skin and is good for the hair. . And both have no smell.

2433 2018-01-01 17:31:25 My point is if this group had found a way to win 3 more games, are we having this discussion? Imo, we are not & that's the problem. The issues are the same, regardless of where they sit in the standings. What the team needed was for the GM to put together a better roster
2434 2018-01-01 17:31:24 When the Arab world produces oil and gas maps with Arabian Gulf in it I will delete my tweet and post the new map. Everything else: talk is cheap!
2435 2018-01-01 17:31:21 coal dies first, then oil, then natural gas. And that's when nuclear energy - fast breeding reactors and some time later fusion reactors come to the market
2436 2018-01-01 17:31:07 "South Korean authorities have seized a Panama-flagged oil tanker suspected of evading international sanctions by trading with North Korea, officials said "
2437 2018-01-01 17:31:06 Oooooooh vitamin E is oil? I thought I was going to buy the pills then grind them, then add them. 
2438 2018-01-01 17:31:00 He also reversed ban on nets re whales/turtles/dolphins. Fix THAT. Oil in Alaska, Utah will kill l000s of animals, dozens of species. Say NO. It's oil $ FOR trump, y don't u understand that. Wall is a racist sham, $ for trump. Serves no purpose. Animals suffer. He won't get wall.

2441 2018-01-01 17:30:08 I need to go get some olive oil. I loooove it for my hair n scalp (like the kind you cook with). We let these brands add too many chemicals to our products.

2448 2018-01-01 17:29:22 Lol. Don’t forget though. Vitamin E is an essential Oil. Please use carefully. Mix with the castor oil before whipping in the butter.
2449 2018-01-01 17:29:07 On NYE, we did a home version of Chopped and I made pho in 45 minutes with leeks, scallions, pecans, and shrimp. I also lit a pan of olive oil on fire.

2458 2018-01-01 17:27:21 Intrinsically safe is a nightmare :o) Luckily aluminium heat exchangers are well inside the guessing zone.
My range of oil coolers is designed to be ATEX certifiable, but I would rather buy in complete fan-sets ready to go. It saves a lot of time.
2459 2018-01-01 17:27:00 And if there was , I highly doubt they would , Scotland could simply do a Gordon Brown Westminster hack job and steal the sea anyway? But there lies the rub of STOLEN oil , it wasnt "just" the Tories.
2460 2018-01-01 17:26:52 Funny enough, I was looking at 152 & 153 Brigades at Third Ypres. The use of burning oil drums is positively medieval.
2461 2018-01-01 17:26:39 Scott Jennings @ScottJenningsKY You forgot to mention Trump said an interview that Papadapolus was a Good Guy, Oil and Gas expert. Your argument is bogus and the investigation continues.
2462 2018-01-01 17:26:24 They have less talent? How’s that ? They have a way better transition defence and way more offensive depth .
2463 2018-01-01 17:26:12 All the oil producing countries we put on placards because they sold fuel at cheaper prices during #OccupyNigeria.... Wonder where they are now with regards to petrol prices or economic stability?
2464 2018-01-01 17:26:07 Girl you need an essential oil diffuser I diffuse mine at night and if I fall asleep and don’t turn it off it automatically shuts off when the water is too low! It’s amazing honestly

2468 2018-01-01 17:25:54 Fracking is currently allowed under the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's regulations. It's classified as a "workover" -- one of a group of tasks that generally involve re-entering an old well to repair it or squeeze more oil out of it.

Sleep when you can. Burping very important. If making formula make sure no air pockets in bottle. Oil massage good for bones. 

You guys will be amazing parents!
2470 2018-01-01 17:25:49 I understand Oil from Russia is being delivered to North Korea.
2471 2018-01-01 17:25:41 @Pseudo_Isidore That's as maybe, but the damage will be immense - marketization of HE is inappropriate and the board will all contribute to this iniquity, just like Browne did - BTW, Browne, how is the oil/petrol industry such an effective market considering the concentration?
2472 2018-01-01 17:25:32 Don't know where the money's coming from, but oil companies are in, since they want to drill in the Canadian Arctic (easier, pergelisol's melting). They know there's oil there, since Russia drilling is so crooked that they might be under CND by now. Putin & oil, rings a bell?
2473 2018-01-01 17:25:26 The economic crisis is not linked to "currency control": that's a lie by @aantonop. Controls on exchange with USD have existed for a long time (and exist in many other countries). Oil prices fall in 2014 and US sanctions are main cause of huge drop in income

2475 2018-01-01 17:25:13 Tied for fifth worst record isn't a tad below expectations--it is a massive organizational failure given the roster. At minimum, the coach needs to go, and if he doesn't get fired Peter should follow him out the door for refusing to make a change when the team needed it.
2476 2018-01-01 17:25:12 I need to go get an oil change, but watch they say I need all this other stuff
2477 2018-01-01 17:25:10 Ctax raises gas prices about $0.02/ litre. Oil companies raise it $0.10/litre.... guess which increase UPC and Kenney go apeshit over?
2478 2018-01-01 17:24:43 Then to finish the soup, I simmer two chicken breasts in the broth for 20 min, to cook just enough. Remove it, shred when cooled. Then I remove the broth from the pot, add oil and 1 chopped onion, 1 chopped carrot, 1 chopped celery stalk and cook until soft
2479 2018-01-01 17:24:39 Oil finished at 60.42  /barrel up 12.5%, gold at $1,309.30/ounce. #oil #gold #Nymex #comex @reuters

2481 2018-01-01 17:24:35 I got blocked I was not  playing with her today the coconut oil worked!
2482 2018-01-01 17:24:28 No action is taken by traffic police.  No use of traffic helpline whats app no.  Car and bike is Park at indian oil nagar bus stop . Blocking link road.
2483 2018-01-01 17:24:28 Stop telling people to put coconut oil in their hair btw, some people have protein sensitive hair and it just ends up making their hair rough as fuck and even if it worked well you can't be using that shit constantly
2484 2018-01-01 17:24:14 Oh it's not because other countries have been meddling for years and that they want control of the oil reserves...with the USA leading the way....nah it couldnt be any fault of those countries and the USA could it??

Gas is fine for 1-2 decades , renewable s need backup plants
Oil is crushed sooner the better , no need for it

Rosatom rules nuke business ,only China can compete whit price like that
2491 2018-01-01 17:23:05 Bullshit. You've fallen for the diversion of paid protesters (paid by the west) while jihadists (backed by the west, Saudi Arabia & Israel) blew up an oil pipeline in Iran.
2492 2018-01-01 17:22:48 Yeah, it's poached in olive oil. There's also salt and black pepper
2493 2018-01-01 17:22:44 Okay I jumped on a train when I was a little girl it might have been carrying my oil Mr Johnson said that picture of that train yall showing might be carrying oil
2494 2018-01-01 17:22:28 Yep. As I wrote, I just grabbed what was nearby. I had to scrape oil off the top but it came out really well. And now, hoppin’ John time!
2495 2018-01-01 17:22:00 Fun fact: I once won the Presidential Enviornmemtal Youth award for work I did to helonsea life after the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
2496 2018-01-01 17:21:55 "I'll finish it, I promise!" Crosses her heart.

"I'll just have to buy more paint and oil pastels."
2497 2018-01-01 17:21:44 Yes, Twitter is after all a for profit company and has been bought out by oil money.
2498 2018-01-01 17:21:41 Trump/Mueller is like oil & water. Pathological liar & honest & honorable hero
2499 2018-01-01 17:21:39 Lot of potential in solar (says the guy with an oil background) ... especially, if the politicians keep out of it

2501 2018-01-01 17:21:26 Funny thing is if the Oilers had 3 more wins no one would be saying boo and that's the issue. Yes, it's gone a tad worse than expected but not to the extent some are suggesting. Unfortunately, it needed to get this bad for the masses to take notice.
2502 2018-01-01 17:21:21 Yaaay. The clear castor oil? Not the black one oh.
2503 2018-01-01 17:21:20 Too much  wasted on #Rajinikanth . Protagonists building castles in the air , antagonists demolishing  them with verbal missiles. Give him time. Spirituality and  realpolitik are immiscible like oil and water. Capturing power equipped with armour, velvet gloves is the game.
2504 2018-01-01 17:21:14 it's electric cars VERSUS natural gas cars now. Europe can buy natural gas from Russia and Iran and  switch vehicles to run from oil to natural gas
2505 2018-01-01 17:20:50 You can get both castor oil and vitamin E at any pharmacy.

2509 2018-01-01 17:19:51 I don't think we have oil here.
2510 2018-01-01 17:19:42 fusion reactors + electric batteries will hit oil/natural gas exporting countries hard. in Russia Rosatom has to compete with Rosneft and Gazprom.Gazprom competes with Rosneft and Novatek. But fossil fuels are finite.
2511 2018-01-01 17:19:41 So my mom has straight hair and she put my coconut oil eco style gel in her hair thinking It was oil  Im so weakkk
2512 2018-01-01 17:19:40 Apart from one moment when I confused Filippo Berio Olive Oil for Tullamore Dew Whiskey, it was a good New Year's Eve. Still drinkable tho'.
2513 2018-01-01 17:19:36 I've got a sourdough going. But of an experiment today , a couple of teaspoons of goosefat in addition to the butter. My recipe can use either oil or butter.
2514 2018-01-01 17:19:34 you'll have to give up driving as well then, all that saudi oil. then again probably for the best that your biggoted ass never leaves the house
2515 2018-01-01 17:19:21 In Chicago. Temperature is -8. Feels like -27. The beard oil I put on an hour ago is frozen into crystals on my face from my walk to the train.

2520 2018-01-01 17:18:51 That dude who sprayed the oil on the floor would never be able to sleep if he did that to me.

2527 2018-01-01 17:18:14 Excellent read! To bad most Canadians would skip over,because of OIL in the title.Brainwashing starts in kindergarten!
2528 2018-01-01 17:18:06 I gotta get my oil changed
2529 2018-01-01 17:18:00 They can be 'fantastisch' so I hope yours are! In dutch it's oliebollen (one word). Olie == Oil and Ballen == Balls.
2530 2018-01-01 17:17:49 Some news reports say Saudi state owned energy company wants to invest in our booming oil production areas in Texas. We should just say no to this OPEC remnant that is a creature of a Stone Age government that would not hesitate to harm U.S. consumers if it still could.
2531 2018-01-01 17:17:47 Get you some of that sea shanty lifestyle. Learn 1000 uses for whale oil.
2532 2018-01-01 17:17:43 Ooh thanks for the headsup. Was thinking of getting an oil for massaging my hands
2533 2018-01-01 17:17:41 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
2534 2018-01-01 17:17:27 No it shouldn't; that has never worked. Our goal is to have no need for the middle east and leave them to their tribal Hatfield & McCoy lifestyle. That simply means becoming oil independent, which we are working on.
2535 2018-01-01 17:17:00 @drekaplan fuck you, garbage snake oil salesman
2536 2018-01-01 17:16:49 I got a candle and bath oil as a surprise present for Christmas and I was so blumin happy!  the candles are slow burning so a bit more justifiable for the price!
2537 2018-01-01 17:16:41 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
2538 2018-01-01 17:16:38 If we get rid of religion and oil, would we have more peace in the world?

2546 2018-01-01 17:14:52 Cheers, I think I may have lost my sense of the funnies after that game last night. ..I'm all good now :)
2547 2018-01-01 17:14:52 I couldn't agree more!!
This afternoon I made a very simple lunch and it was so good!
I simply cooked veggies in olive oil on low and scrambled some eggs and then ate that with some fresh bread from the bakery down the street.
2548 2018-01-01 17:14:47 So they are only interested in oil and minerals? Shows you the motive behind the clamour. The areas mentioned create jobs and improve welfare of people. If @GovAyoFayose had revived Igbemo rice farms he would be in same league with Ogun State now but alas- ariwo lenu vendor
2549 2018-01-01 17:14:47 I think this fits well into the image of sovereignty he's building. Besides, Baghdad still sees Ankara in cahoots with Erbil due to oil and trade ties. Ceyhan is still pumping KRG oil so he can't accept their offer of mediation.

- Omelet with little to less oil 
 - Green tea 
- Chickpea salad with liiiiiiiiiiiittle bit of rice. 


2556 2018-01-01 17:13:25 Hmm. Cocoa butter (check wuse market). For vitamin E atink you might have to google. For castor oil, for the clear one, that might be hard oh. Google too.
2557 2018-01-01 17:13:20 Refuse to import China made plastic products. Plastic resins are made from LPG's & not oil as everyone thinks. Find the resin mfrs. & set up recycling near them.
2558 2018-01-01 17:13:17 I was kinda hoping the coconut oil I put in my hair would sort my hangover out as well but I think the benefits have been greatly exaggerated.

2562 2018-01-01 17:12:58 The reason US right-wingers go on about Venezuela is because it has the largest oil reserves in the world. So much for humanitarian worry.

2571 2018-01-01 17:11:40 The time for minor tweaks has passed. Heads need to roll.
2572 2018-01-01 17:11:37 Sorry, the NDP only paid lip service to oil before Kenney was elected. And, the current efforts have been impotent.
2573 2018-01-01 17:11:33 They have to buy oil
2574 2018-01-01 17:11:30 Yeah, suffering and dying on the beach would've accomplished so much. That makes great sense. Better to let an endangered species die than rehab it and release it. Guess you consider oil spills and manmade dangers to them "natural". You're a callous person.

Is it more likely that a few people are making shit up to sell snake oil, or a huge conspiracy of researchers is being flawlessly coordinated?

2604 2018-01-01 17:08:04 Don’t you get it dude? The oil companies need more money. Money is more important than life and water. C’mon, get with the program.

2607 2018-01-01 17:07:59 South Africa, not an oil producing nation, is reducing PMS pump price because the Rand is improving. How far with recession excited Nigeria?
2608 2018-01-01 17:07:58 Awww, how cute. No matter how often "trickle-down economics" gets debunked for the snake oil it is, some people just can't help themselves but regurgitate the same old lies.
2609 2018-01-01 17:07:51 Every day is Fry Day. They might as well wash it down with a tall glass of Wesson Oil.
2610 2018-01-01 17:07:38 I know nobody cares about Africa, there's no oil in them there hills only mid slides and famine who would want to help them? They get what they want the way things are don't they? Why change it? I mean human life is valueless until it owns something huh?

2612 2018-01-01 17:07:19 Anne Idsal is another Bush oil industry shill, now a placeholder for the Trump admin. Just following in a long line of those crude addicted dinosaurs who came before her. They can’t make a honest living without a reliance on oil obviously.
2613 2018-01-01 17:07:09 I 'may' be allergic to coconut oil though.  Have been ill a couple of times after having it.
2614 2018-01-01 17:07:05 found myself answering about the time of changing a car's engine oil in an examination. life.
2615 2018-01-01 17:07:04 I’m so grateful for my mom  I told her I had a headache & we didn’t have any Tylenol so she gently rubbed peppermint oil on my temples & I could just feel the angels taking the pain away
2616 2018-01-01 17:07:02 Blood is thicker than water, water is thinner than oil, KAMA  drinks all. 
2617 2018-01-01 17:07:01 Speaking into existence: I will find oil today
2618 2018-01-01 17:06:33 I sleep with rosehip oil on my face every night! Makes a world of difference when you put on your makeup in the morning. Make sure you're not over-exfoliating though! That can cause even more dryness and irritation
2619 2018-01-01 17:06:10 What do you think happens to all the money that goes to London? Oil & production costs looking good.

2622 2018-01-01 17:04:42 Just be sure to add a little oil to the chocolate so it has the right texture. Also good for chocolate dipped fruit with a nice shine (the chocolate will harden when it’s not heated). About to make chocolate-dipped candied clementines with our leftover fountain chocolate
2623 2018-01-01 17:04:36 Cocoa butter whipped with vitamin E with castor oil as a carrier. Smells great, protects the hair and skin

2625 2018-01-01 17:04:18 It WAS an amazing year in Alberta - but it wasn't because you were having your sideshow. Recovering oil prices, sensible government policies. We'll gloss over the UCP MLAs who broke laws, threatened people, lied. #abpoli #ableg
2626 2018-01-01 17:04:18 Ugh "stolen oil". Always the nub of the issue for you guys. I've talked about it with enough of you separatists to understand you know nothing about it and just parrot it off cause it might sound good and creates a grievance. Boring.

2764 2018-01-01 16:45:02 So how is it better environmentally to transport gas/oil in massive tankards all the way from US/Canada/India with all the burning of diesel/heavy oil entailed & where we have no controls on fracking methods as we could here? Where’s moral responsibility in NIMBY? for populism?
2765 2018-01-01 16:44:55 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.

2785 2018-01-01 16:41:51 The same thing was said about Venezuela and look where Venezuela is today. The US keeps buying oil from Vzla and is keeping Maduro & cronies in power.  It’s all about the almighty $.  Unfortunately, the same thing will happen to the Iranian people. All talk and no action!

2796 2018-01-01 16:40:39 You dream of appeasing the white man so he gives you a visa to Canada.  After all, India is the land without toilets; where man, woman and child are forced to "do their toilet business" on the streets, in the open.  Don't pretend you're dream isn't in Canada.  Admit it.

2810 2018-01-01 16:38:41 Diplomacy is now your only option because someone decided it was better to punish nk woth santions and thought the other countries that were also sanctioned were just going to join right in. Hows that working out with vessel to vessel oil transfers.
2811 2018-01-01 16:38:32 This is the kind of wind project which should be implemented:
* In tornado alley
* Connected to existing transmission

It only needs suitable backup: oil/gas peakers or seasonal storage.

But we need more due diligence than "go green or we'll say mean things".

2835 2018-01-01 16:34:52 Except our capacity to meet our repayments isn't sufficient. 

It's perfect for Usuary and Fiat. This means that the SOE's will be privatised, i.e. Sold off.

2888 2018-01-01 16:26:28 Also this Saturday I wanna get my care checked out. Hood latch is ducked so I went about 2+ thousand miles over the limit for my oil
2889 2018-01-01 16:26:02 I always do research before I ask questions. So I’ve tried vitamin E, aloe vera gel, cocoa butter, Coconut oil. Maybe it’s bc I see myself naked everyday but I have seen no progress whatsoever
2890 2018-01-01 16:25:54 That is Hemp Oil, not the designer marijuana people are smoking.
2891 2018-01-01 16:25:21 Islamists terrorize the world but you demand capitulation of #Israel  just because Muslims used to West prostituting for Arab oil and money;  many ignore history of Jesus, a Jewish reformist, who practiced Judaism  in Jerusalem the capital of the ancient Judea- hence the name Jew
2892 2018-01-01 16:25:19 I'm not sure if I understand healthy new year! The best new year for kurdstan people is when they are free from oil burglars & family mafia who repressed people's freedom & the wealth of the country is being looted by PDK &  PUK.
2893 2018-01-01 16:25:16 Peppermint oil and coconut oil literally works for everything!

2897 2018-01-01 16:24:41 Thanks. Saw that one alright. Was wondering if you used a pva glue based product to transfer the image how would it affect finishing the wood with danish oil or varnish
2898 2018-01-01 16:24:39 Jamie Oliver: Pour the Coco Pops into the bowl. Splash of milk, from a height and then a good glug of olive oil!
2899 2018-01-01 16:24:37 The former got paid out quickly the latter took years. There are still oil spills.
2900 2018-01-01 16:23:54 Do u hav oil no then u won't get no sympathy from Haley and trump
2901 2018-01-01 16:23:49 yeah I hear that. I take like 2mL/day of cbd oil on a good day and the bottle is only 40mL and not cheap at all

2903 2018-01-01 16:23:41 It’s -15 degrees outside. Put on some coconut oil before stepping outside 
2904 2018-01-01 16:23:30 Tea tree oil sis
2905 2018-01-01 16:23:13 Oil companies would love to see higher oil prices but if the Strait of Hormuz is shut down for months they don't make money if they can't move the stuff.  It would crater the economy.  All the GDP growth and manufacturing jobs we've clawed back would be gone.
2906 2018-01-01 16:22:56 Where is  your outrage over Russian oil being sold to North Korea?  Oh wait, that would probably upset your boss Vladimir. #PutinsPuppet
2907 2018-01-01 16:22:52 Yes hamstrung. It was government who decided that we should not drill for oil in our own country. It was the government who decided call was too dirty to mine. It was government that said it was too dangerous to use nuclear power. Solar and wind what a joke
2908 2018-01-01 16:22:46 Is there peanut oil in the (very tasty!!) fries?  A friend of mine is allergic. Just curious.
2909 2018-01-01 16:22:44 We need a picture with vegetable oil, water and glycerol.

My well pipes are frozen, and my heating oil is having a hard time getting to the furnace (beginning to freeze as well). 

This is a great start to the new year... smdh
2913 2018-01-01 16:22:22 Are you Jekyll or Hyde today? Support the Iranian protesters while banning them from our country. Sounds more like Oil and Plunder is your goal. Somewhere to rob after you're done with the Great American Heist that's now well underway.
2914 2018-01-01 16:22:21 Some Nigerian threats sha,which one is you are dipping your hand inside hot oil. 

2915 2018-01-01 16:22:15 2018... another GREAT option  for the end of the world!! If not, let's keep oil in our lamps and light up the night!
2916 2018-01-01 16:22:06 Lmaooo fam, u go collect 1 liter of  anointing oil go house.
2917 2018-01-01 16:22:02 #electric cars effect on oil exporting countries. 2018 resolution ,crypto currency vs internet hacking, scientists vs technology. Nature vs pollution,

2918 2018-01-01 16:21:59 Did the snake oil wash off lol
2919 2018-01-01 16:21:56 Coconut oil in a KFC plastic container
2920 2018-01-01 16:21:54 Yup. With coconut oil it’s 
2921 2018-01-01 16:21:43 If oil starts being traded in Yuang, this would be devastating for the US... I'll be following that chain of events very closely
2922 2018-01-01 16:21:40 There is another conservation method infact using CNG vehicles rather than oil consumed vehicles...I request our govt to make strict laws stating that all govt vehicles should be of with CNGs then some awareness could be found
2923 2018-01-01 16:21:30 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ따끈..
2924 2018-01-01 16:21:24 Isn’t Iran the 4th largest oil producer in the world?.......just asking for a friend 
2925 2018-01-01 16:21:14 Sir do you know the oil price in international market? Please price gone $35 barrel to $60 you just calculate how much price increased in Pak on %age wise in last 6 month.
2926 2018-01-01 16:21:13 So you don’t want pay for someone else’s healthcare but don’t mind paying for someone else’s corporate jet or “research”. Oil companies receive hundreds of billions a year of tax payer money in the form of subsidies regardless of record billion dollar profits
2927 2018-01-01 16:21:04 @realDonaldTrump Hey President why are the gas and oil companies being aloud to scalp us at the gas pumps ....... a tax cut is no good when they are aloud to rob us and yet we’ve given them better drilling privileges.

2932 2018-01-01 16:20:28 Eating out with families, The NDA government has refused to pass on the windfall benefits of a crash in oil prices in global markets with a variety of taxes and cesses , denying the motorcycle or small car owners some extra cash in pocket.
2933 2018-01-01 16:20:22 Wasn’t it 1953. Mossedegh was removed as PM to allow the weak Shah to return as Monarch. Truman said no before Eisenhower said yes, under pressure from the Brits over oil. It was a covert op. A sad day for Iran and USA. The worst was 1979 though.
2934 2018-01-01 16:20:17 That’s your choice I suppose. But university fees, free prescriptions, etc, & still doing better. It’s not that simple & I wonder when we’ll see the effect of the oil price rise & halving of production costs having an effect on the deficit & what we pay into the kitty?
2935 2018-01-01 16:19:59 I need to go get a oil change and wash my car
2936 2018-01-01 16:19:58 Islamists terrorize the world but EU & UK demand capitulation of #Israel just because Muslims used to West prostituting for their oil & money; many ignore history of Jesus, a Jewish reformist, who practiced Judaism in Jerusalem the capital of the ancient Judea- hence the name Jew
2937 2018-01-01 16:19:54 Its possible to be oil friendly and not a climate change denier.  Or vehicle friendly, city friendly, cow friendly.  They ALL contribute strongly.
2938 2018-01-01 16:19:40 On any basis the oil sands are more polluting.  Enjoy your delusions tho

2941 2018-01-01 16:19:17 China should stop sending NK oil if we do go to war. No oil makes war very hard.

2944 2018-01-01 16:18:27 Just want to remind everyone of the way djt is making America great by making regulations on oil rigs looser and eliminating regulations governing elderly care facilities.  GREAT for WHO??  RELEASE YOUR TAXES!
2945 2018-01-01 16:18:13 The memory of you falling over in that black oil will haunt me for a while... wishing you even more success for 2018 (especially with @RedWolfShow) 
2946 2018-01-01 16:18:03 Ask any Democrat if they believe cars will one day run on water. 

99% will say with enough government funding and research, one day it will happen. 

They also believe the oil companies are preventing this technology.

Fales Premise = False Narrative = Democrat Mindset = Fools
2947 2018-01-01 16:17:54 Make up has become fun over the last 3-4 months maybe cause I like the art of painting and blending colors anyway ever since I had to take an oil painting class  Painting is one of my more expensive and messy hobbies

2953 2018-01-01 16:16:37 beshram Jeli Khan this is due to hike in oil prices in international market. Saudi has increased 80% Pak has incr only Rs.4,.

Why don't we not forget the root of the problems masked as "Ethnic Cleansing"

2968 2018-01-01 16:13:56 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
2969 2018-01-01 16:13:49 No, charging is an advantage since most people charge at home overnight, while sleeping. Fully fuelled car ready every morning. Charge waiting time is nil. No need to ever drive to a fuel station, queue for a pump, then pump fuel, then queue to pay whatever big oil is charging.
2970 2018-01-01 16:13:44 And butter usually has ~7 per tbsp, unless you have some kind of vegetable oil spread :p
2971 2018-01-01 16:13:37 買わざるを得ないな…
2972 2018-01-01 16:13:34 And the ppl killed because they tried to hurry it up, skipping crucial  steps to avoid a disaster.  BP and big oil doesn't care. There are many oil rigs slowly leaking into the waters, slowly  snuffing out the life of everything in the wster, for black gold. Greed
2973 2018-01-01 16:13:32 I got lame ass art stuff for christmas. Thankful my family thought to buy me art stuff. Not thankful the stuff sucks. I got oil pastels that leave marks when smeared ??

2980 2018-01-01 16:11:07 I guess if everything remained status quo in 2018 except that I was in much better shape, I'd think I was doing ok. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that's what comes with their snake oil! 
2981 2018-01-01 16:11:03 I put olive oil and lemon juice on my hair...  'Tis supposed to be floofy now.
2982 2018-01-01 16:10:38 This is such propaganda . Iran was just as much of a disaster as it is now before the Islamic revolution: the Shah was a CIA puppet dictator who simply put the oil needs of the USA and Britain ahead of his own ppl. If you’re going to make a point make it accurate. Not bullshit.
2983 2018-01-01 16:10:30 gotta sit down with mum every other day once i go back home so she can apply loads of coconut oil, my hair is not in the best shape at all

3028 2018-01-01 16:06:20 Tesla Model 3 $50k -$14k rebate= $36k Minus the savings of gas/oil over 5 years= ~$25k Range EPA is 300km/500km. 98% of commute even in the coldest weather is no problem. Charging is done at home so ubiquitous stations unnecessary. Aged battery @ 90% after 500,000km @Model3Owners

3032 2018-01-01 16:05:32 You looking at the wrong scam. It is the additional trinkets that rake in the money. Soap, books, water, oil etc. Those are the money spinners.
3033 2018-01-01 16:05:10 It’s very sly gestures intended to save more time to complete missiles reaching to USA. And also to avoid oil pressure .After reading many esteemed articles,I felt some basic elements or genes short of Koreans. They think in their own ways. We must seedaggers behind their smiles.

3038 2018-01-01 16:04:23 good going. If there are a few things that i've seen really help, they are: vegan, lots of avocado, porridge, coconut oil, sweet potato, organic soy/tofu. No soda, fruit juice or cake. HUGE breakfasts. Very nutrient-dense meals. HIGH-calorie meals (within ur daily allowance).
3039 2018-01-01 16:04:04 The PEOPLE in oil rich countries are not the beneficiaries of the oil wealth.

3043 2018-01-01 16:03:47 The grass is not greener on the other side watchout what u are asking for, don’t turn into Libya, Iraq,Syria or Yemen. Foreign governments will use you to damage ur country, they will come in take the oil and leaves you hanging. Been used . Wake up

3052 2018-01-01 16:02:32 Mr Trump singled out as his main accomplishments of 2017 the tax overhaul, opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, and changes to the national health care law.

3058 2018-01-01 16:01:13 I’ve tried it and would definitely suggest giving it a go. It makes you feel very peaceful, relaxes your muscles, and will certainly help (at least a little) with your pain. I’ve used the oil and smoked a CBD strain and found both experiences to be very positive.
3059 2018-01-01 16:01:12 You nailed it, Jim. The Mullahs all pocketed the $$ and jacked up the price of food and oil for their people.

3096 2018-01-01 15:53:17 Why can’t Canadians read a blog like this and understand why the West needs off shore shipping.

3107 2018-01-01 15:50:49 But it does not matter so much what you “think” In 10 years your industry is history anyway. Oil and gas can’t, despite the billions of dollars they receive in subsidies annually, not compete with wind and solar. So good luck sticking to a doomed industry!

3167 2018-01-01 15:43:03 The same North Dakota that’s having an oil boom?
Jeez ~ I wonder why they’d like to do away with regulations all together?

3172 2018-01-01 15:42:11 @realDonaldTrump What happened to Russian sanctions? You failed to roll them out. Now Russia cuckholds you, giving oil to NK. 32% SAD!
3173 2018-01-01 15:42:07 Wonder why oil prices are firming up and headed to 70$. Why is Fracking, which is supposed to be economically viable at even 60$ not kicking in to keep the prices in check?
3174 2018-01-01 15:42:00 I need a a gallon of axe oil

3177 2018-01-01 15:41:35 Does advertising n resulting consumerism really take bread out of mouths of the poor, or oil machine that produces abundance of food n other necessities?

3187 2018-01-01 15:39:05 If it wasn’t for the West, that oil would still be under the sand.
3188 2018-01-01 15:38:42 mmmmmmmmmmmmm ..... olive oil laden lip balm ...... mmmmmmmmmm

3190 2018-01-01 15:38:05 My 2018 New Years Resolution is to only use olive oil.
3191 2018-01-01 15:37:42 Nag halo yung castor oil at yung luha ko. Hahaha
3192 2018-01-01 15:37:40 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
3193 2018-01-01 15:37:29 I never tried primrose oil but I did try castor oil and it put me in labor. I had prodromal labor though, so it was days before I actually had him. I know you're miserable!
3194 2018-01-01 15:37:28 Let them nationalize their oil then
3195 2018-01-01 15:37:13 My 2018 Predictions:

February: North Korean animosity resolved.

March: Masses of oil, gold, silicon, platinum, found under every continent.

June: Poverty eliminated.

August: Peace on earth.

September: Cancer cured.

December: Solar flare, global destruction, all life ended.
3196 2018-01-01 15:37:12 Even if America stops funding to Pakistan, China will continue aiding Pakistan. Burning example is the oil being supplied to North Korea. @republic @realDonaldTrump #TrumpDumpsPak

3198 2018-01-01 15:36:29 I Need An Oil Change.
3199 2018-01-01 15:36:18 Three week streak oil price hike, what the fuck is wrong with our govt making us falsely believe that the new TRAIN Tax would not immediately impact the excise tax on oil, gasoline and kerosene. Such a lie
3200 2018-01-01 15:36:18 This guy has a show?  I can’t tell you the number of lies from Trump about what he did or will do but hasn’t. This whole article was about what he might do and drilling oil in ANWR which has been a Republican/Oil Companies dream that started prior to the Ukraine Russia conflict.

Or organic coconut oil since we all trying to do better! #idefinemeGirl
3210 2018-01-01 15:34:36 Oil of oregano  actually works... kind of shocked how good I’m feeling this morning since last evening I had one fierce man cold coming on #fluseason
3211 2018-01-01 15:34:14 then imma go get Blanca washed and get the oil changed 
3212 2018-01-01 15:34:03 You have received some rather heated responses Jackie, for which I am sorry but I hope in them you will understand how raw a wound Hillsborough is here? The mere fact that it was Katie Hopkins saying it = pouring oil on the fire (pun intended) 96 people unlawfully killed no joke
3213 2018-01-01 15:34:00 Oh we’ve tried everything except castor and primrose oil. I’m now 4 days overdue and over it
3214 2018-01-01 15:33:50 ありがとうございます！！！大事にします！！！

3216 2018-01-01 15:33:43 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3217 2018-01-01 15:33:41 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.

3219 2018-01-01 15:33:40 Try a Burt’s bees moisturizer with a drop of tea tree oil. The oil is a natural cleanser and is gentle and the moisturizer will make it even gentler.
3220 2018-01-01 15:33:31 A healthy alternative to vegetable oil for cooking is high-quality virgin coconut oil.
3221 2018-01-01 15:33:20 If you want to go down the rabbit hole of oil's role vs USD check out part 3/5 of @MacroVoices current series "Anatomy of the U.S. Dollar End Game" w @MarkYusko @LukeGromen @JeffSnider_AIP @ErikSTownsend
3222 2018-01-01 15:33:17 Government ko chahiay tha k petrol aur diesel sasta  krta q k new year k khushi mn but govt risen the prices of oil....an other shameful act of present govt
3223 2018-01-01 15:33:12 an oil rich nation with perennial fuel scarcity! 

no serious investor will ever take that country seriously 

#FuelScarcity
3224 2018-01-01 15:33:10 And you are hungry for money and oil, Sir..
3225 2018-01-01 15:33:09 ついにですか！？
3226 2018-01-01 15:33:08 No man. You two mix like oil and vinegar. Awkward.
3227 2018-01-01 15:33:08 We don’t fear Russia ( @RT_com ). We in the Resistance sure hell don’t respect them. They got the story twisted. Russia is just another Pakistan with a little oil and a few more nukes.
3228 2018-01-01 15:32:46 i rasa i kena start berniaga to afford tarte maracuja oil hagahagahaga
3229 2018-01-01 15:32:41 Did you know that in the USA an oil needs to only be 5% of a natural source for it to be sold as 100% “organic” essential oil? I didn’t either till I got a chemical burn. At #YoungLiving we own our own farms and we ARE 100% organic. We EXCEED organic. #knowyouroils
3230 2018-01-01 15:32:34 Other countries like China and Russia are not really true to you they know you are a troublemaker and they still ship oil to North Korea cause they know you are a troublemaker
3231 2018-01-01 15:32:23 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!

3234 2018-01-01 15:32:05 one more reason to get off oil and gas.
3235 2018-01-01 15:31:44 @BruceMcCurdy The PK practice was obv great coaching. Scored against on the first two last night; mercy rule might have saved them on the 3rd.
Meantime Oil 0/2 on “power” play, few good chances all game  at evens or otherwise. 
Something deeply wrong with the collective.

3241 2018-01-01 15:30:49 Yep ... it's EXACTLY the same as the tobacco companies lying about smoking causing cancer. Oil co's worked from identical playbook. Some of the same players were even involved.
3242 2018-01-01 15:30:49 They used to be more reasonable for Oil Kings with so many little ones. That was at old arena though and before the bigger restrictions.
3243 2018-01-01 15:30:42 Spent my first day of 2018 making really tough decisions like "should I get out of bed today?" "What beard oil should I use?" 2018 is a hoot this is gonna be my year 100%

3250 2018-01-01 15:29:49 Trump has decided to sell arms to Ukraine ,allow our field military to fight with wide authority in the field with great success and call out the Chinese when the secretly try to supply NKorea with oil America interests first
3251 2018-01-01 15:29:40 Never mind our oil paying for the destruction of the unions & miners & destroying large industry sooner than required!
3252 2018-01-01 15:29:23 #KimJongUn should know he will be denied oil until he sits down with @potus administration.

3262 2018-01-01 15:27:10 Fantastic news - hope they make progress & come up with a solution.
So you accept there is a huge plastics problem then ?
Sorry I must have misunderstood you when you intimated there isn’t a problem & all plastic will just magically break down because it’s made of oil.
3263 2018-01-01 15:26:43 I’ve said for years it’s only a matter of time b4 Ok has a disaster of significant mortalities & damage repair. They’re fracking in the soft gulf coast areas of La too—another fully corrupt red oil state. All this oil, and none can balance a budget, either.
3264 2018-01-01 15:26:37 Really surprised how many places cook in rapeseed/canola oil. Found out when my daughter was diagnosed with a seed allergy.
3265 2018-01-01 15:26:27 2015: Butter and Coffee.
2016: Add Coconut Oil & Butter to Coffee.
2017: No dairy. Add Brain Octane oil & collegen protein to coffee.
2018: Add Ketones to Coffee.

I must really be angry at my Coffee but the 2018 version may be the best yet.

3270 2018-01-01 15:26:11 Actually toyed with that one for the list Deon. I really like the break above 7000, but am just worried that the big target will be largely due to GBP weakness. But I hold SYGUK and like it a lot. (Think it says something about stronger oil too)

3273 2018-01-01 15:25:47 Sounds good, if full of bloody tourists :) Our neighbour's been drilling for oil...or so it seems.
3274 2018-01-01 15:25:35 Relative to United’s revenue, that is nothing. City are outspending everybody using oil money.
3275 2018-01-01 15:25:35 Well done trump but could you please tells how many billions  americans stole from the Saudis, Iraqs and the Libyans oil fields ? Approxmately 100 bilions last 3 yrs....
3276 2018-01-01 15:25:05 what you stole their money and oil already?
3277 2018-01-01 15:24:54 Except it ignores sales taxes or natural resource (oil, gas, tourism) inequality. As well as Fed Govt paying for services low tax states ignore. But I guess some double taxation is fine.

3284 2018-01-01 15:24:03 How much America has wisely paid to Terrorists against Pakistan? How much paid to Criminals like Raymond Davis to spread terrorism in Pakistan?

America has foolishly done many things in history, like to attack Iraq to occupy Oil resources, to bring the world on edge of WWIII.
3285 2018-01-01 15:24:00 Republicans are weird. They're ok with oil and tobacco companies buying votes, BUT GOD FORBID A CELEBRITY OR ATHLETE EXERCISE THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO SPEAK OUT ON ISSUES

3293 2018-01-01 15:22:33 They going to support palestinians too? Or just the war drums beating because of Iran’s oil?
3294 2018-01-01 15:22:21 Oregano oil. WTH is with that? Is this recommended to people globally or is it more of a Vancouver Island thing?

3296 2018-01-01 15:22:04 Price of crude oil up nearly 100% since 2015 Election..yet over $5.5b borrowed within the last year alone. Facts.

3313 2018-01-01 15:19:32 Russia is aiding Al Queda in Afghanistan.
Russia is aiding ISIS in Syria
Russia is giving nuclear technology to NoKo and sneaking oil in like your tweet about China.
No complaints about Mother Russia!
Russia is not our friend, they are our enemy and Trump has committed treason
3314 2018-01-01 15:19:26 Had oil wells not been there than these islamic loonies would not have been able to do anything at all!
3315 2018-01-01 15:19:23 America Continued support of dictatorships even after their human rights abuses were known was geared toward continuing to maintain a conducive environment for American corporate interests abroad, such as the United Fruit Company or Standard Oil.

3421 2018-01-01 15:03:59 The "Venezuela" meme is a false analogy. First, Venezuela had massive sanctions put on them, meaning trade became almost impossible. They were going to trade oil to China and Russia instead of the U.S., so our government thought it a great idea to starve Venezuela citizens.

3428 2018-01-01 15:02:59 Right now the globalists and former leaders who had a hand in
deposing the former Shah, and bolstering this regime, are planning their
strategy. I have no doubt they'll pretend to be the ones championing the people, while positioning themselves to manipulate & control Iran's oil.

3444 2018-01-01 15:00:18 "You want fries with that?"

"This is Jiffy Lube."

"S'all right. We reuse the oil." #FirstJobProbs
3445 2018-01-01 15:00:04 You said 6 days ago, back to work. All you did was golf on our tax money for those 6 days. And you Still haven't commented on Russia supplying North Korea w/ oil.
3446 2018-01-01 14:59:59 Have you tried CBD oil yet? It doesn’t take the pain away 100% or help much with fatigue but OH MY GOD it helps SO MUCH

3448 2018-01-01 14:59:34 if you can, cbd oil straight up is better than the capsules. It does help with fibro. There's studies on it with fibro too!
3449 2018-01-01 14:59:01 So things are changing Windpower is happening in Alaska Sitka did this huge upgrade to the hydro-power but spent way to much money $ that is no longer available because of the price of oil That’s how we paid (past tense) for everything in Alaska oil revenues!
3450 2018-01-01 14:58:54 We transferred all our wealth by buying all their oil throughout the years! Time to drill our own!

3456 2018-01-01 14:57:53 There are a few states who legalize the oil
3457 2018-01-01 14:57:40 I hope they share with us enerfybsolutions that don’t use oil. And I I hope they give me a job.
3458 2018-01-01 14:57:34 Excited na ako sa Anointing of oil service hehehehe
3459 2018-01-01 14:57:28 Early morning workout felt great. I'm trying to get so toned, I'm going to have an open shirt casket. "Please dip my body in baby oil as is expressed in my will." 
3460 2018-01-01 14:56:43 Oh, your just upset about subsidies for big oil and they're going green.
3461 2018-01-01 14:56:27 oil cleanser kau guna ape? naise do result dia. geram aku tengok skin routine orang. semua buat double cleansing
3462 2018-01-01 14:56:09 Remember when a hater called Misha a snake oil salesman in a series of tagged attacks that that ended up in the comments of an article and mysteriously later he  issued a complete commercial for Serpessence?
3463 2018-01-01 14:55:57 Night routine malam ni saja tak nak apply sleeping mask sbb dah apply thick cream moisturize, but i feel so tight teruk area dahi terus bangun balik sapu huxley oil essence top up with sleeping mask. Now  surely boleh landing on muh bed

3471 2018-01-01 14:54:01 Oncology is a multi billion industry. So cannabis oil at 500 rand a bottle will threaten clinical treatments.

3474 2018-01-01 14:53:33 Have a pretty bad oil leak on the VW. Any recommendations on where I could take it today in HSV/Madison? Several places closed.
3475 2018-01-01 14:53:28 Itu pake baby oil dulu, apa langsung tusuk aja?
3476 2018-01-01 14:53:25 Mmmm more oil please
3477 2018-01-01 14:53:14 It really doesn't I lived their for two years while in the service met my wife, her family loves it up there and wouldn't move, many feel the same way, most go to MN for jobs, but with OIL/GAS rigs many more jobs there now. You get use to it.

3481 2018-01-01 14:52:03 Auxin makes the world go round. More valuable than oil. A lot of oil is decomposed auxin, probably (& obviously decomposed whole plants). No auxin, no oil. 
3482 2018-01-01 14:52:01 Trust me Trump does not care about Iran oil. The US has plenty of its own. Iran is the largest state supporter of Terrorism. Iran leaders  oppresses & lies to its people to stay in control. These are the reasons. I'm glad the Iranian People are rising up. I hope they succeed.
3483 2018-01-01 14:51:52 悲しいなあ。
同人音楽オリジナルを聞く機会がすっごい少ない。
3484 2018-01-01 14:51:39 Isn't it western values who say they are oppressed? Let's see, last western supported leader in Iran. The Shaw wasn't it? How did that go - for the people?  The US and oil did well, people severely oppressed by rich guy put in place by US.
3485 2018-01-01 14:51:38 Once we have their attention, then teach them how to click on #radonc. But make sure to warn them about references to snake oil, so their feelings aren't hurt.

3490 2018-01-01 14:51:05 Meron din. Halos lahat daw meron oil solution kaya ang hirap maniwala hahaha
3491 2018-01-01 14:51:04 I tried the CBD oil capsules but nothing topical yet. It's all so damn expensive!
3492 2018-01-01 14:51:03 Simple truth is oil and making money from wars that’s the new economy for the world bullies.
3493 2018-01-01 14:51:02 It's not selfish keeping your hand out of my pocket. Besides that it doesn't sound like our money, oil, gas, crops,beef, timber or anything else we produce in flyover land is good enough for you city dwelling vermin. I vote we let the cities sustain themselves.
3494 2018-01-01 14:50:57 Ooooh, sounds good. I wish I had bottles of my fave essences too! I hear camellia oil is VERY good for the face. Apparently @itsgabrielleu uses it in her routine and she still look Bring It On good. Appreciate the live tweeting hon!  Happy New Year 
3495 2018-01-01 14:50:57 Nigerians/Africans politicians stealing your collective inheritance & giving you a fraction of it in return for an endless life of hardship, ill health &untimely deaths is not EMPOWERMENT.

IT'S MANIPULATION &MORAL BLACKMAIL. REJECT THEIR GIFTS OF RICE, OIL ETC. YOU DESERVE MORE.
3496 2018-01-01 14:50:42 Finally USA realized there is no oil at pak and only terrorism available #TrumpDumpsPak

3501 2018-01-01 14:50:18 Your right. USA promised to back up the Taliban and Osama in the 80s USA reneged on that and Qaida was born out of what the US did. And remind me why they invaded Iraq? Oh thats right OIL.
3502 2018-01-01 14:50:17 For future reference to all who occasionally get one of those popped taste buds  - put coconut oil on it.  Instantly relieves it and 6 hours later, barely even feel it!!!!

3504 2018-01-01 14:49:45 Also wrong to sell oil to North Korea. China does what they want.
3505 2018-01-01 14:49:42 Just read the comments in an article about “oil shaming” and I guess it’s 2018.

3510 2018-01-01 14:48:53 5/Although, China does export some crude oil, with NK it was coal. China is the largest importer of oil in the world. I don’t believe that ship they “caught red-handed” was filled with Chinese oil. Probably Russian—they’re a major exporter of oil. China imports Russian oil.
3511 2018-01-01 14:48:20 They already spent 60 trillion on their defence. ..oh yea another 75mill was needed.  I bet you one of them fans who has their flags and shirts Bought for em by the club to create atmosphere. ..u see the similarities between the oil slick n the chelski thug life owners?
3512 2018-01-01 14:48:18 There are different types of Canadian crude.  He is speculating on WTI, which is the benchmark and what our oil, such as Western Canadian Select, will be pegged off of, minus the differential in pricing.

3550 2018-01-01 14:40:37 So wash, condition, balm, oil, and comb/brush?
3551 2018-01-01 14:40:20 Has Trump checked out Puerto Rico lately? They're hungry, too, and many STILL without basic services. They are Americans. America First? Find a job you are good at, like selling snake oil in a traveling show. 33% of 'Americans' would buy it.

3554 2018-01-01 14:40:05 At a minimum we need to be able to control and support closed ecosystems before intersolar system travel, biosphere is a good indication of how hard that is.  I think this line of thinking is techno optimism just as peak oil die off is doomer porn.

3556 2018-01-01 14:39:41 Call it what it is. It’s not an “overhaul.” It’s a “rollback and repeal” of measures implemented to prevent the next largest oil spill in U.S. history. Those who don’t learn from or choose to ignore history...
3557 2018-01-01 14:39:25 Annointing oil is R100
3558 2018-01-01 14:39:19 Did you miss the story about Russia secretly giving oil to North Korea?  Did you miss the story about Russia attacking our democratic elections?  Did you miss the story about Russia taking de facto control of Syria and expanding their naval base there?

3564 2018-01-01 14:38:59 Yes,would be wonderful. However not likely to happen. Trump thinks his Tweets help violence in Iran. Truly ignorant. Tweets flame fires he continues throw “oil” on. Has no idea WHAT to do But BLAME Obama.Trump is Dangerous Moron. Our  allies can no longer trust us..Disaster..

3567 2018-01-01 14:38:27 Thank you!  There's something about it that immediately struck me as reminiscing of a classic 19th century oil painting. The romantic, archetypical setting and characters, the oddly highlighted animals to the sides, the Khajiit who looks inquiringly back at the viewer, etc.

3570 2018-01-01 14:37:46 If we would withdraw all humanitarian funds from the Middle East & lead a world wide embargo of their oil. Very soon, they’d be fighting with sticks & stones.
3571 2018-01-01 14:37:45 Yougaiz... It's been a li'l while since Khadi on Lloyd's Road opened after renovation. And it's as usual amaze. Tried usual stuff - palkova, rose water, oil. Hair, skin and tummy are very happy!

Go try.

3574 2018-01-01 14:36:57 You are prepping your base for war. You want the oil in the Middle East so bad you are willing to sell out America.
3575 2018-01-01 14:36:46 Best wishes to all in 2018. Let's not support fake news channels, let's not listen to people in neat suits if they talk bullshit, let's not allow oil/gas/coal companies to defend their activities and let's all promote renewable energy and protect and maximize life!

3578 2018-01-01 14:35:45 I used to mix peppermint and lavender oil with lotion. I haven't tried the others.
3579 2018-01-01 14:35:39 How much vegetable oil to heat my home?
3580 2018-01-01 14:35:25 I get to start off my new year by paying my mortgage and the oil delivery I got today #adulting
3581 2018-01-01 14:35:24 ชื่อที่พักอะไรคะ
3582 2018-01-01 14:35:11 All the more reason to find and leverage our own oil reserves, arm Israel to the teeth, and eliminate our dealings with these reprobates.
3583 2018-01-01 14:34:59 ทำไมพี่คุณชอบทำผมเปิดเหม่ง

3585 2018-01-01 14:34:43 “I have to put more oil in my diffuser because TJs breath smells so bad”
3586 2018-01-01 14:34:41 What a shame? Is the oil running dry. Encourage local refineries. Legalized the local refineries and the government can share in the revenue by taxing the local oil refineries. It takes huge investment by the community for the local refineries to operate. Stop closures. Support
3587 2018-01-01 14:34:29 Are you cutting it with a carrier oil? Have you tried frankincense or eucalyptus? I have a muscle rub blend my sister made it has ginger & some other ones
3588 2018-01-01 14:34:15 It would be very simple to ask him that, based on his comments about China sending oil, how does he feel about Russian doing the same.
3589 2018-01-01 14:34:12 Fish oil, flax seed oil, multi vitamin, coconut oil, acv vitamin, etc. lmao.  Like 10 vitamins no lie but as I get older I need whatever supplements I can get.
3590 2018-01-01 14:34:01 So many oil changes XD
3591 2018-01-01 14:33:48 Ban the trade of ivory just like no more oil for North Korea . Good luck with that.

3593 2018-01-01 14:33:27 Cetaphil + bio oil + loreal hair oil /? :(
3594 2018-01-01 14:33:21 Yes. Blame oil spills and global warming for that.
3595 2018-01-01 14:32:55 hahahha bleh jugakkk. jgn memain weh ayah aku dah siap buat page argan oil hahhaha
3596 2018-01-01 14:32:51 Trump attacked Pakistan and Iran this morning, but he has yet to comment on Russia secretly smuggling oil to North Korea like he did with China. It is time the press take the gloves off and ask Trump hard hitting questions, and stop letting him ramble unchallenged.

3599 2018-01-01 14:32:11 Or even mentioning that it was RU not "Shina" who sold oil to DPRK - on video.

3608 2018-01-01 14:27:58 Read their minds
i said this before and going to reiterate again, Saudi Arabia plans for Aramco IPO is a sign it has given up on $oil market shares, a very smart decision by taking a page from $drys crooked CEO

stock market is an easier way to generate income not market shares
3609 2018-01-01 14:27:55 weh jadi model teatree oil aku. nk gmbr before and after. bg before yg kaw2 pom2 punya ok
3610 2018-01-01 14:27:33 Total BS. I know big oil very well. I know executives who make those decisions. The fact is, its nothing more than a marketing ploy to shut up you left wing losers and radical environmentalists
3611 2018-01-01 14:27:31 Msamen, honey & olive oil
3612 2018-01-01 14:27:31 But don't you think, that there gonna be some "resistance" zone? For example, people could easily use electrical cars for a decade, but oil holders were slowing the progress.

I’m surprised he didn’t join Trumps regime. He loves oil&coal and hates the poor & kids,unless they r a fetus

3637 2018-01-01 14:20:11 Hmm... Heidi Shitekamp was elected using the Native American vote... emphasis on "using," since she tossed every Native under the bus for the sake of Big Oil! She better hope she's in the mood for reconciliation, because... how many in the Indigenous community want her again?

3640 2018-01-01 14:19:52 Hey Tamela!
No amount of Navy OJT is going to compensate for the fact that you never paid attention in Biology, Geology & Physics, Toots!
Everything is made from carbon & everything burns
It’s a life cycle
Matter cannot be created/destroyed
Plastic is oil
3641 2018-01-01 14:19:45 Again you’re living in a Trump world that ignores facts & truths - yes many plastics are made from oil but most man-made plastics will take thousands of years to degrade - meanwhile it is poisoning whales & marine life.
Please consider the facts not conspiracy theories.
3642 2018-01-01 14:19:27 One of the ways the Nigerian government can attend to the needs of Nigerians is to stop destroying sole man oil refineries. Try to support and find ways to legalized the illegal oil refineries. Provide funds for small businesses and tax the business accordingly.

3656 2018-01-01 14:17:05 I’ve enjoyed this thread. Oil wrestling for the winner?

3658 2018-01-01 14:16:58 Finally, their isn’t one “opposition leader”.  Some are against Roudhini because he is too MODERATE.  Most just want the money conomy better which is driven by (a) US driven Oil embargo and (b) international poultry prices of all things.
3659 2018-01-01 14:16:42 Nice... 
But Jihadist terrorism and his willingness to conquer Europe and the Western world by radical Islamist is much older than using oil.

3663 2018-01-01 14:15:54 In return for your 33 billion you have control of the gas and oil pipeline routes through Afghanistan, which you're using everyday to steal from other countries. You've probably gotten back more than your outlay many times over. you'll not admit that being so honest.

3666 2018-01-01 14:15:31 Targeting Iran consists in, not only reclaiming Ango-American control over Iran's oil and gas economy, it also challenges the presence and influence of Russia and China. ~ Michel Chossudovsky

So they can easily get #oil.
3669 2018-01-01 14:15:26 Don't know the future of oil but it's still going to be here for the meantime. They are going to drill oil as long as it's worth something, so it doesn't change anything environmentally when they use it to back their dollar (apart from being able to hopefully stabilize it)

3720 2018-01-01 14:06:12 Wellness Tip: Use olive oil in place of butter. Olive oil has outstanding heart-health benefits, and it’s flavorful so you can use less.
3721 2018-01-01 14:05:46 I'm sure it's been said before but really...
Come on global warming. Where ya at? It's -7 and I need give my truck an oil change.

3726 2018-01-01 14:05:01 Exactly like the fact almost every terror group, leader, and ideals come straight out of Saudi....oh yeah they have oil n gold. Iran, North Korea don't so lets take them on. Pretty cowardly of us.
3727 2018-01-01 14:04:49 We have too much brains that’s why we avoid problems Naija have. How can an oil nation have oil scarcity ? Cos u lack brain hahahaha
3728 2018-01-01 14:04:47 This from the guy who declared we should have taken the oil?  Isn't that the definition of looting. Ok it didn't happen, but he sounded SAD that it didn't. Even suggested that maybe we would in the future. Does he remember he said that? Iran/Iraq I guess he knows the difference.
3729 2018-01-01 14:04:26 The price had gone up in the international market. Therefore the major oil marketers didn't want to take a hit since the government had said no subsidy.

3737 2018-01-01 14:03:20 The big question is, will this be backed? or redeemable?  The 1 barrel of oil sales contract suggests at least partial redemption.  All projects have governmental risk, this one is just implicit rather than externalized and frankly aligns gov. interests with honoring the contract

3764 2018-01-01 13:57:29 @JoeNBC Benjamin Franta's Guardian article shows the willful ignorance of the oil industry on climate change even though it received scientific warnings as far back as 1959. Like the tobacco industry, it could not solve a problem whose solution threatened profits.

3842 2018-01-01 13:42:17 Ah yes. You want to loot it instead. You did say we should keep the oil in countries we win wars in did you not? I'm pretty sure human rights are not something you worry about ever. Especially for USA. Extremely dishonest fake president.
3843 2018-01-01 13:42:16 Dallas Morning News published a Trump Tracker in today’s Jan 1, 2018 paper today.  Tracker reflected increases in total jobs, oil production, and wages for Texas and national.  But Texas was ahead of national level.  Oil production in Texas was 100% over national level, etc.

In order, a) this is a highly contentious stat, GERS figures, worth of Faslane, oil income over 10 years etc. all make this a dodgy figure. b)This deficit is largely due to WM incompetence, we could manage our affairs much better. C) we could have both... etc etc.

3943 2018-01-01 13:23:21 First, happy new year! But what made Iran, irak and Co such a situation? America was at war there for oil. It also releases terrorist militia who, to a certain extent, want revenge from America's war crimes. That took decades and now YOU want changes? This will not work...

3953 2018-01-01 13:21:58 Yep.  And then Trump will twist that into "saving" Iran via invasion.  Mighty convenient if Iran stopped pumping 4MBPD of oil so that the price of oil goes up.......
3954 2018-01-01 13:21:53 It was a "secular democracy" for only as long as it took for Iranians to elect politicians who weren't acceptable to Anglo-American interests, especially oil.
Hence the coup to install the Young Shah & a repressive regime which was overthrown in 1979.
3955 2018-01-01 13:21:43 For a while now, every week I've been doing an oil mask on my hair and scalp to get it more healthy since I dye it so much. I didn't cut my hair in 2017 and won't in 2018, let's see how long it'll go and how healthy it hopefully will be!
3956 2018-01-01 13:21:40 Price increase is least in Pakistan.  UAE where the oil is produced has increased their oil and prices much more than Pakistan. Pakistan doesn't produce oil.

3983 2018-01-01 13:14:59 Rex is thoroughly unqualified to be Secretary of State.

4034 2018-01-01 13:07:37 One has to wonder why our "tough guy" @realDonaldTrump hasn't said a word about russian ships delivering oil to N. Korea against UN sanctions.  

Starting to sound like it's more about "russia first" than America.
4035 2018-01-01 13:07:28 Russia is an interesting topic,few realise that Russia has no debt,its human rights within its own boundaries are disgraceful which is known by most,some could say it’s like North Korea only much bigger,and then theirs America and what it has done to control the oil,who is right

Loads of US companies have invested in Saudi oil and US has even provided military protection to them to keep their investment safe, not the case with Iran.

4130 2018-01-01 12:48:03 The world's oil $$ has come back in the form of media, infrastructure and cultural investments to the tune of billions of dollars.  Just research any media giants recent financial statement.  "The proof is in the pudding".

4138 2018-01-01 12:46:48 So exited for all the things to come in 2018 with @MK21Digital! It was an amazing year with so many projects to be proud of, securing three Oil and Gas clients and the largest commercial property company in the UK... This year I hope will continue to be busy but a lot of fun!

4147 2018-01-01 12:44:21 How about a national being someone who does not approve of their bankrupt neighbour plundering £1.8Trillion NPV of oil revenue alone because they are greedy, aggressive and devious - will that do??

4170 2018-01-01 12:38:36 Because they do as they are told. And the people who call the shots are buddies with the Ayatollahs or get iranian oil with a discount. Human lives ain't worth crap when it comes to profit. Sad but true.

4184 2018-01-01 12:33:42 about the files: banking interests always trump national resource interests. one can control a country by its currency. resources may always be bought, for a higher price maybe. In addition, oil trade must be guaranteed in USD to avoid the fiscal collapse of the US.

4208 2018-01-01 12:29:36 Just a heads up: the cheese bites and apple pies in McDonald’s (UK) are NOT vegetarian, the oil they are cooked in is filtered with the oil they use for cooking chicken

4214 2018-01-01 12:27:39 Of course.  They are probably behind this latest rebellion in Iran.  They desperately want their oil.

4278 2018-01-01 12:12:20 Yet you admire other dictators who do the same thing.  Iran has oil. Is that it?

4286 2018-01-01 12:10:03 And that regime was the outcome of years of misery under the Shah, who was imposed on the Iranian people by Britain and America after their democratically elected PM attempted to nationalise their oil

4297 2018-01-01 12:05:28 Venezuela, Hamas, IRA, Cuba. The Tories have great scaremongering fantasy arguments. Never hear from u about a Corbyn style social democratic Scandinavia, or Norway's wealth built on a nationalised oil industry, or a far more left wing Post War Settlement.

4308 2018-01-01 12:03:07 Buy oil futures and you have the same without the risk Venezuela is changing mind and removing the backing of oil! But I wouldn’t be surprised crypto freaks would pay triple the price of oil for such a petro!
4309 2018-01-01 12:02:57 Try some new skincare!!! Bio oil takes quite some time ://
4310 2018-01-01 12:02:44 wasn't France looking after Khomeini before his return to Iran. and wasn't The US stirring the pot where it could to increase the price of oil to it competitor the EU? There is two repressive nasty regimes to start with.
4311 2018-01-01 12:02:31 To be fair Gary, Mourinho has spent nearly 300m and if United can't keep pace with a club owned by an oil wealthy nation, what chance do the rest.

4322 2018-01-01 12:00:18 @realDonaldTrump So, you thought China was giving oil to N. Korea, when it was actually Russia doing it? Your buttbuddy Putin f*cked you over pretty good, didn't he? I guess you should be used to it by now, huh?

4334 2018-01-01 11:53:06 Wow that's a good point I didn't think of.  Maybe making it more efficient can save petrol/oil used for transport? I'd like to believe we're improving on the environmental front as well. 
4335 2018-01-01 11:52:29 Toby, perhaps you could get Owen Jones and Seamus Milne to explain to us where it all went wrong...Friend Corbyn still seems to see Venezuela as a good example but someone must have a clue to the riddle. And it is not all a question of lower oil prices...
4336 2018-01-01 11:52:26 Bernie wants the same things Hugo Chavez wanted (a living wage? Free Healthcare? Tuition free college? Nationalize the oil industry after they participate in a military coup?)
4337 2018-01-01 11:51:57 I have a gram of oil stuck to my phone screen right now 
4338 2018-01-01 11:51:47 And where would all that wealth come from with no oil ,whiskey revenue  ?

4340 2018-01-01 11:51:35 Which is why "peace-loving democracies" will prolong it until their planned imperial land-grabs are secured (think Middle East oil concessions)
4341 2018-01-01 11:50:47 I really like oat and hazelnut oil. They are both super nice, but they have a bit of a different flavour.
4342 2018-01-01 11:50:36 Actually there was a democracy before the shah, it was a secular elected gov, however, since the prime minster of the time i believe, nationalized the oil, the British decided to dispose of him and install the shah. And the rest is history
4343 2018-01-01 11:50:24 You tryo. I don't know which kind of government is this who cannot ensure simple compatriots RIGHTS. in a country that exports OIL
4344 2018-01-01 11:49:22 Everything in that article is largely irrelevant to your fuel price claim. In Jan 2016 (Before referendum was even announced) oil price was at $33. R u suggesting the current oil price is due to brexit? Why won't u give me a breakdown to backup your claim?
4345 2018-01-01 11:49:17 Ek toh desert hai ... and now tax not good for Saudi ... you need to find a alternatives other than oil or you will perish

4351 2018-01-01 11:47:24 3) Between this,the Norwegian Min. of Oil, Søviknes, comes with promises that the oil will be produced for decades to such a shit.

4562 2018-01-01 10:44:36 Writer's recipe (Jest in humor)
Take a kilogram of rich, juicy words,
Arrange them into edible sentences,
Deep fry till crisp, in sentimental oil,
Garnish with thriller spices,
Serve hot with erotic sauce.

4576 2018-01-01 10:41:07 Fussing like a senior or single parent on a tight budget. Where’s this concern when the oil companies routinely screw with pricing - pushing prices up 10+ cents a liter just because a long weekend arrived. Did you brave the cold then? Ah. Though so.
4577 2018-01-01 10:41:07 We understand it well. North America at one point was covered by the ocean, at one point covered by a glacier, and at one point covered by molten rock. The Earth used to be a lot warmer during the age of the Dinosaurs. 

And no one is forcing u to use electricity and oil everyday

4581 2018-01-01 10:40:27 Liberals have long railed against the Shah being put in place, but a more general thought may be that many of the conflicts & proxy wars post-WWII were partly due to decaying 19th Century colonial power leading to instability in 20th Cent. Oil takeovers kind of like colonialism.

4610 2018-01-01 10:29:35 What basis do we have for saying that oil in Iran belongs to the Iranian people?

Just because it happens to be in their frontiers? Even if it is under the ground and untapped?
4611 2018-01-01 10:29:22 i hope u have an almond oil 2018!!!!!
4612 2018-01-01 10:29:17 No, the idea is to reduce oil import by blending domestically produced Methanol-Ethanol from Coal, Biomass & Sugarcane, which will be used for trucks, buses and ships.
4613 2018-01-01 10:28:48 Because you are only making yourself and your friends richer. Why don't you care about Russia giving oil to North Korea?
4614 2018-01-01 10:28:28 There’s an excellent environmental speech given to the UN in the 1980s by a (then), child called Severn Suzuki. It’s powerful & emotive. Could tie in to Chn writing a persuasive letter about something linked - palm oil / Plastic drinking straws?  I’ll find a YouTube link
4615 2018-01-01 10:28:07 Oil has been traded in Yuan over a year ago. Nothing new here. For those that don't know; thank Obama and his sanctions on Russia.... now the US loses a monopoly on oil settlement and lucrative currency exchange.

4659 2018-01-01 10:11:09 Rationalgamer, the Qajar king negotiated a deal with a businessman where he put in 0 money, but his kingdom received 16% of the profits.

Already a bargain and a steal.

If Iranians did not like this, they could have invested their own money in exploring and extracting oil.
4660 2018-01-01 10:11:02 ADVISORY: Petron will implement the following increases (VAT incl) effective 6 a.m. tomorrow, Jan. 2: P0.20/li for gasoline, P0.65/li for diesel, and P0.75/li for kerosene. These reflect movements in the international oil market.

4693 2018-01-01 10:01:01 That's the real meaning of exceptionalism. And when , by pure coincidence, there is oil and gas we dont own or control  in huge quantities, then real democracy has to be reinstated by any means. Kermit Roosevelt's hectoplasm leads the way.
4694 2018-01-01 10:00:47 Even though these Kenyans are annoying but it is actually better than Nigeria,Nigeria is a failed state...nothing's working there ,they are biggest oil producers yet they run out of fuel regularly

4702 2018-01-01 09:58:06 so CHIna is now using Russian tankers to export oil to N Korea.....  Again you spew fake news with alternative facts
4703 2018-01-01 09:57:40 i drink lots of water and exfoliate and olive oil
4704 2018-01-01 09:57:27 Use the anointing as beard oil 
4705 2018-01-01 09:57:10 What!!! African mums are so ridiculous . Palm oil, shea butter, Palm kernel oil is not the solution to everything.
4706 2018-01-01 09:56:28 The amount the carbon tax raises in gas is less then some oil companies raise as an over night rate on gas. Maybe you should rail against that too and cut taxes on gasoline to nothing doubt you will but complainers complain right?
4707 2018-01-01 09:56:23 I was tweeting to get advice before my wife saw the marks. I used baby wipes; she suggested coconut oil (and it worked).
4708 2018-01-01 09:55:46 Churchill himself invested a bit in this venture and spent several years in negotiations.

Once the terms were met, it took **over a decade** to even strike oil. 10 years of burning cash and paying salaries without a penny in revenue.

4712 2018-01-01 09:54:33 @JHBWater The water supply at our house seems contaminated. It smells and tastes like oil. We had a power outage on the 30th that was restored on the 31st. Since then the water has tasted funny. It comes out looking milky and it burns when you taste it.
4713 2018-01-01 09:54:27 Cut into long chips sprinkled with truffle or pink salt, sweet paprika and maybe a little grana pedano, olive oil and bake in a hot oven or Webber. Serve with sour cream and home made Sugo as salsa
4714 2018-01-01 09:54:16 I made a mineral oil computer.
4715 2018-01-01 09:54:14 There was no seizure of Iranian oil.

The Qajar king sold rights to Iranian oil to a wealthy British socialite. That socialite bankrupted the venture. It was bought relatively cheaply by a consortium of Burmese, Turkish, Iraqi, and British investors through APOC.
4716 2018-01-01 09:53:50 Fair enough. I agree that over stating one's expertise of both theory and practice is problematic. I also agree that we see a lot of this in sport and those who do are often selling snake oil. 1/2

4723 2018-01-01 09:51:20 I understand. But there's a certain level of desperation that money can't buy... We seem to be comfortable with sharing rice and oil every year.. So till then sha..

4751 2018-01-01 09:40:20 Unfortunately Ray, some of our ruling elite have other interests in the DRC; the minerals, oil etc. Good governance does not feature. They prop up Kabila because they personally benefit from his regime.  sad

4780 2018-01-01 09:29:22 Oil price a 66usd is not good for Nigeria. Let it drop to 12usd so that  the Nigerian govt can tap other neglected resources.

4785 2018-01-01 09:27:24 Who inspires me feel more specific an oil can.
4786 2018-01-01 09:27:09 Violife are my favourite too - the mozzarella melts well and the parmesan is pretty similar to the real thing . Generally I don't like the ones made with coconut oil so I choose cashew etc based ones instead
4787 2018-01-01 09:27:05 I would think it’s cool ruining furniture- that’s how bad ass I’d be and I’d be reapplying oil as the day goes on to remain slick
4788 2018-01-01 09:26:34 By ensuring the American dollar is correctly revalued to the fact that it lacks the gold reserves and oil pricing used to  prop its value falsely:))

4792 2018-01-01 09:23:52 & Europe?-Ukraine now divides Russia, UN sanctions divide EZ, Germany feeling restrained, something has to give, NATO framing #brexit now obviously an OPEC move, shifting sands by the day in geo-pol's, need war in Iran to drive oil price too?
4793 2018-01-01 09:23:10 The free press!  His inability to stand for America and speak/act out against Russia and the hacking of USA dnc snd others. TRump chose to push the stolen merchandise instead of doing what’s right by his country His fake attack on China for giving oil to North Korean.  What’s .
4794 2018-01-01 09:22:47 Village girls treating you like a king makes you overlook the fact that 33% of the stew they make is cooking oil.

4800 2018-01-01 09:21:18 Yes because its an unusual event unlikely to ever happen again. The norm usually returns eventually, oil runs dry or alternative energy sources take over, then we all know what that means to a traditional yoyo club like City #freakish
4801 2018-01-01 09:21:08 Happy New Year! Still haven't found the best way for me to do a wash without making a mess. Going to try oil paints next like Panzermeister on YouTube.

4805 2018-01-01 09:19:59 the Shah, btw, was someone who was installed by the CIA and MI6. Mohammad Mosaddegh was before him and he was the last democratically elected leader of Iran. He was deposed by the British because they were upset that they lost control of oil fields in Iran.

4809 2018-01-01 09:18:30 Nothing you said is true, you are a cybershouting, name calling troll without facts. Mossadegh was democratically elected, and served as prime minister for 2 years before being overthrown by the CIA and MI6 for the crime of wanting oil profits for his own people instead of BP.

4847 2018-01-01 09:06:49 @Krakenbeardco do you guys ship to America? Was browsing and would definitely like to try your products. Not to sound dumb but what's the difference between a balm and oil?
4848 2018-01-01 09:06:32 I just wanna say that whoever created oil paint I hate you goodnight
4849 2018-01-01 09:06:12 Yes, I passed my midnight closed turn in the room, 
with oil on my head and knees bent before my Lord.

Do you want something you never had?

RENOUNCE! that's the key.

4877 2018-01-01 08:56:16 Mathematically impossible to pay off national deficit but USA sits on tremendous assets- untapped oil nationwide as Saudi runs dry. Rumors China moving to 0% corp tax as Trump counter. We're both shaky. Perhaps in everyone's best interest to reset w/ new US asset based currency.

5415 2018-01-01 06:16:45 The Russia part is all about money. And the oil deal is a big part of it but there's also the banking & money laundering. They want to lift those sanctions. Putin's got nothing out of this. It's like a Marx Brothers movie.

5419 2018-01-01 06:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet you and your family.
5420 2018-01-01 06:16:05 Honestly the only thing that held the end of 2017 together for me was coconut oil and I'm going into 2018 starting strong
5421 2018-01-01 06:16:00 In what world?  Greedy assholes like insurance companies and oil companies and financiers are the exact reason we had to have regulations in the first place

5423 2018-01-01 06:15:44 Okay see what you just wrote...bush wanted Saddam and bin Laden.

5441 2018-01-01 06:12:34 dont worry, if you are online or you use a smartphone or use credit card...they already have all your data....question is, do we have theirs? this data is the new Oil in this era... got it? @DrGPradhan

5451 2018-01-01 06:09:37 yep, and i add a tiny bit of sesame oil to mine for a flavor but also so the egg doesn't stick to the pan. i'd rather skip on the perfect authenticity if it assures i'll get it to not stick lol
5452 2018-01-01 06:09:26 Exfoliate before, shave against the grain, coconut oil and then exfoliate and shave with the grain every other day!
5453 2018-01-01 06:09:20 Generally. A lack of oil, or out of time gear syncs grind my gears.

5460 2018-01-01 06:08:06 おめでとうございます。私は去年夏から大阪住まいとなりなかなか関東に顔出せなくなったですが、またお会いしたらよろしくお願いします。
5461 2018-01-01 06:08:04 New Year's Eve party totals. 8 adults. 10 children. 1 blind Pinot tasting. 1 blind Cabernet tasting. Countless bottles of sparkles. Chili. A realization that oven quesedillas are evidently real. Bread. Balsamic vinegar x2. Fresh oil. 1 missing human (adult found safe). Fun!
5462 2018-01-01 06:08:02 I tend to dismiss all new-agey stuff as BS, but my niece bought me a diffuser and lavender oil for Christmas and I swear it works.
5463 2018-01-01 06:07:49 happy new year! the US assisted in the 1953 Iranian coup to depose democratically elected leader Mohammed Mosaddegh bc the UK wanted to control the Iranian oil industry
5464 2018-01-01 06:07:30 Girl I feel this so much. I put coconut oil on my hands earlier and it helped a lot! They were so chapped they were red and broken out!
5465 2018-01-01 06:07:28 Starting 2018 in a bath with eucalyptus oil, a glass of wine, candles burning, reading Sandra Cisneros on my kindle, feeling cozy and relaxed as hell. When I get out, I’m going to do smudge the apartment with sage and then sleep like a baby.
5466 2018-01-01 06:06:41 I heard that adhesives that stick to plastic tends to be REALLY hard to get off because otherwise they wouldn't stick at all. =__=

Unlike glass, you can't just use oil either because it tends to leave a residue.

5495 2018-01-01 05:59:27 Oil won’t beat Vegas or Nashville, so 4-5 wins would be max.
5496 2018-01-01 05:59:10 A lot of ppl uses coconut oil
5497 2018-01-01 05:59:10 But when it happens it'll be shit. It's important to make sure regulation and analysis of risk are in place. Don't forget mt polley poisonous spill in Fraser & Saskatchewan river huskey oil spill.

5510 2018-01-01 05:56:45 British Columbia in Canada was no different. Maps showed our entire province on fire and people still threw lit smokes into the streets. I work at a oil change shop, I had to put out 3 fires started by smokes. There's always going to be people who don't think, and it hurts all.

5594 2018-01-01 05:38:08 Don't agree. We throw the baby out with the bath water too fast in Dallas. Dak needs time. We got the anointing oil too soon.

5623 2018-01-01 05:30:41 I totally love our #2A rights, but idiotic fools who unload a single bullet, much less several magazines skyward, should be boiled in oil. 
5624 2018-01-01 05:30:08 And yet, bypassing the Grid, look at how many households use fuel oil to fire their furnaces in the northeast and Midwest. Sad legacy that is ubiquitous still in 2018
5625 2018-01-01 05:29:34 Exactly right, Hartmut. But the libs are stuck on the whole oil thing. Even when we DID need the oil, we never took a drop. And I think we legitimately could have asked for some help paying for that war--but no. Bush was too afraid of what the Dems would have said.
5626 2018-01-01 05:29:26 Fk me, phenomenal revisionism. He was an evil coward & opportunist who tortured and murdered thousands. Let's just ignore the CIA overthrowing democratically elected Mossadegh in pursuit/theft of Iranian oil.

5635 2018-01-01 05:27:38 The world is technologically capable of creating an alternative fuel source but the oil giants and oligarchs across the world want to keep making money off of war & oil. We need a revolution against the Tyrant cowards that are in charge.

5657 2018-01-01 05:20:50 The problem the regime faces is that the IRGC key people are still sanctioned due to missile development and human rights violations. The IRGC controls the banks and the energy biz. No real bank will deal with the oil proceeds. Period.

Pumping in my living room.

With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,

5678 2018-01-01 05:17:16 Jimmy also reduced the National debt. He did it by taxing the crap out of big oil, instead of giving them extra tax breaks
5679 2018-01-01 05:16:52 One way or other CIA is behind this. First Saudi and now Iran. Middle east wars and this entire refugee crisis is all becos  of US interference in the Gulf for oil and sale of ammunitions.
5680 2018-01-01 05:16:52 ... interestingly, the business at this address over 100 years ago was a doctor's office; the doctor was apparently a bit of a snake oil salesman, pushing a remedy for addiction to alcohol and opium.
5681 2018-01-01 05:16:47 Doesn't the oil company anticipate that? Haven't had oil in many years, but they always showed up in time. Hope you stay warm!

5689 2018-01-01 05:15:08 Pharmaceuticals do nothing to treat depression.  They simply mask the symptoms. SSRIs are based on junk science. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, mindfulness meditation and pot are going to drive you snake oil salesman out of business,  eventually

5694 2018-01-01 05:13:57 No. Actually the opposite. Even the nuke deal was not sufficient to prop up regime. And with the continuing sanctions (missile and human rights) the extra oil exports are for naught because they can’t actually get the money from oil sales back to Iran.

5719 2018-01-01 05:10:32 The easiest way to take makeup off it’s to put oil on a paper towel wipe it all over your face and then wash your face it comes off so easy.

5727 2018-01-01 05:08:54 Luckily, those foul Saudis are playing with the oil prices to spite Iran which has been pushing down prices globally for a while now. This led to a crash in rental prices here which means I can live more affordably in a surplus of properties.

5732 2018-01-01 05:07:52 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
5733 2018-01-01 05:07:40 The rent in this city is pretty high yet the city is garbage really. It's a powerful oil city for Europe so there are a greater rate of wealthy oil workers and business owners, and also two decent universities - those factors make the price unpalatable.

5760 2018-01-01 05:01:57 @realDonaldTrump Iranians are belatedly waking up to the realities and feeding on the crumbs of the rock turning and famous Arab Spring. The right to welfare ; affordable food ; and fuel is non negotiable for citizens in an oil fountain state. Good luck

5763 2018-01-01 05:01:24 Do you suppose China secretly alerted US for the satellite photo of oil tankers to give them plausible deniability when they tell NK that they can't sneak oil to them anymore?
5764 2018-01-01 05:01:05 Hillary KNOWS that Iran sits on a sea of oil!!
5765 2018-01-01 05:00:46 By not changing engine oil and billing it

5767 2018-01-01 05:00:24 please check with some oil companies who have successfully implemented DDC and cut tanker accidents to almost nil.. and the good thing is there is somewhere to start. I am available to explain the importance of this probono as it's time we all contributed positively to this
5768 2018-01-01 05:00:16 I just massaged sum face oil & cocoa butter on my face cuz it’s been so dry lately. My son walks in & asks me why I’m sweating so bad. Bruh.. it’s the oils shining on my face.

5778 2018-01-01 04:56:59 The .middle east will never be free until humans stop using oil.
5779 2018-01-01 04:56:53 Now that the oil is running out, they need other sources of revenue generation. One of the major reasons businesses flocked to Dubai was lack of taxes. If the Middle East wants to stay relevant by end of this century, they must invest in their economies rather than terrorists
5780 2018-01-01 04:56:36 なにがあった？
5781 2018-01-01 04:56:28 OIL UP YA ANKLES LET YA TIMBS TAP
5782 2018-01-01 04:56:10 Maybe not, but there's such a thing as having enough oil. You put too much out there and the price goes down. We didn't take Iraq's oil--we paid for the whole dam war and got nothing. You guys are a one song canary.

5790 2018-01-01 04:53:19 Just one question, Mike. 

With the way Team Trump goes out of their way to not piss off Putin/Russia, example being both China and Russia supplied NK with oil yet only Trump called out China.....

Question: Do you think Trump colluded with Russia to gain an advantage??
5791 2018-01-01 04:53:14 Good! I’m going to tweet to the President and his immediate circle until he openly admits this is happening! Squeaky wheel gets the oil!
5792 2018-01-01 04:52:51 Best use for left over pot roast: Mash all leftovers by hand or masher with a few tbsp of Worcestershire sauce. Heat up pan and oil well. Spoon mixture into pan and crisp up for awesome roast beef hash. Serve with eggs and toast for breakfast.
5793 2018-01-01 04:52:20 MY OIL IS MY FAVOR!!! @apostlekcurry #watchnightservice #theoilwillflow
5794 2018-01-01 04:52:09 Oh no! Is not regrettable at all, keep on transporting our crude oil to Britain while we suffer fuel scarcity.
5795 2018-01-01 04:52:06 I started my new year by trying to blow out a candle that had scented oil in it, blowing to hard and ending up with hot oil and wax all over my face
5796 2018-01-01 04:51:28 You respected the lying, mediocre-minded Bush Jr?

Never forget the crimes of Bush/Cheney.

5800 2018-01-01 04:50:59 What the fuck do the people in my house not understand about "if you use the last of something replace it". I replaced your olive oil and you repay me by drinking all my coffee creamer. Okay. Okay.
5801 2018-01-01 04:50:58 Oil & water?
5802 2018-01-01 04:50:52 This has some shaved shallot + every herb in the house (this is parsley, cilantro, basil, scallions, tarragon, but any or all is fine) crushed or chopped and mixed with olive oil, drizzled over with lemon juice, sea salt, pepper.

5806 2018-01-01 04:50:32 You and your buddy Zinke don't listen to the American people who want clean air, water and the environment protected. They want their hunting and fishing lands unspoiled by coal mines and oil derricks. But neither you nor POTUS listen. Only to Robert Murray.

5810 2018-01-01 04:50:09 The 5 foolish virgins represent those who profess Christ but truly don't possess Him. They aren't saved The oil represent the Holy Spirit.

5822 2018-01-01 04:48:02 Exiting the Paris accord is NOT an accomplishment in that it only benefits your big oil and coal friends by rolling back clean air and other regulations, like covering tailings ponds which can be fatal to wildlife if not contained.  Americans want the environment protected!
5823 2018-01-01 04:47:52 Hmmm.......can you do that too but its oil?
5824 2018-01-01 04:47:37 Oh cool I got my norco, CBD oil, and Tension Tamer is extremely good.

5838 2018-01-01 04:44:15 Aha! I've been saying Communism hurts immigrants, and that immigrant families are the natural allies of conservatives and libertarians. You can't be for both Communism AND immigrants, or the Iranian Islamic Republic tonight AND immigrants. They are oil and water.
5839 2018-01-01 04:44:05 C'mon. Oil companies NEED that money. Political donations ain't free, ya know.
5840 2018-01-01 04:43:58 I remember last year when all of Oil country still thought Hall trade was good for the “team”. Eberle had 1 bad playoff & had to go.. and Drais fed off 97 and somehow fetched 8.5 million! PC is not a smart NHL mind! Google his trade list, speaks for itself. Don’t blame McLellan
5841 2018-01-01 04:43:55 Imagine the panic he might have felt if the line was busy calling in PK-Weber deal.

5849 2018-01-01 04:42:24 Yeah, I'v had a couple accidents with oil burns before and they always took forever to heal.  I'v learned to keep it nearby haha
I'm accident prone
5850 2018-01-01 04:42:07 Sigh.
I understand that you believe that.
But right now, national parks are about to be used for drilling oil and gas.
Not thrilled.
5851 2018-01-01 04:42:06 The only kind of wrestling Pixxy and I will be involved with is baby oil wrestling. With each other.
5852 2018-01-01 04:41:46 Iran hasn't invaded anyone for over 200 years. Obviously any theocracy is toxic so let's invade Saudi, emancipate the women and create a secular Muslim homeland where we can deport the "undesirable" extremists to. Oh ya and steal their oil.
5853 2018-01-01 04:41:35 we will dip all mullahs in battery acid before behead them and broadcast it live and sending down jamkaran weLl to mingle with mahedi blood and dump 10 tanks of oil and set them all on fire #Iran

5864 2018-01-01 04:38:55 In a statement issued here on Sunday, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed the decision of increasing the oil prices “an open enmity with the nation” and demanded of the government not only to withdraw the increase, but announce at least 50 per cent reduction in the prices.

5867 2018-01-01 04:37:47 I think we'll find they're choosing to be clueless Brett to suit major political donors in the coal/oil/fossil fuel industries. They don't care about the future. They care about getting the big bucks today and staying in power.

5871 2018-01-01 04:36:43 Even though there is value in the oil there is more value in what's carrying that oil @apostlekcurry #watchnightservice #theoilwillflow
5872 2018-01-01 04:36:35 Gonna need Olive Oil this time to take the ring off  #OyVey
5873 2018-01-01 04:36:06 There is value in oil @apostlekcurry #watchnightservice #theoilwillflow @FREEOFNC

5881 2018-01-01 04:35:05 But the bigger teams in the Pacific didn't struggle last year. SJ, Anaheim, and Edmonton all made it into the playoffs. Only LA dropped off and I'd argue losing Quick for so long had an affect on that as well as Kopitar's production falling off of a cliff. Not playing style.

5883 2018-01-01 04:34:46 Don't trust the chinese government. Look at how they secretly transfer oil to nk.
5884 2018-01-01 04:34:13 Try:
Cats Claw (capsules)
Astragalus Root (capsules or drops)
Olive Leaf Extract (capsules or drops)
Oil of Oregano (drops) (take w/honey)
Hot lemon water with honey. 

These (among other things) help to boost your immune system. 

Feel better - good luck.
5885 2018-01-01 04:33:57 lmao, i wish. Sadly there is an Oil fan that lives here and she crossed them out.
5886 2018-01-01 04:33:40 But I can finally breathe through my nose! The trick is literally bathing in Vick’s Vaporub, scalding hot water, and peppermint oil.

5911 2018-01-01 04:28:36 @Neilson_Knives I have a forging question. When heat treating, and you quench in the oil, can you leave it in the oil TOO long? I know you can pull it out too early.
5912 2018-01-01 04:28:36 well they have to be better then the last ones my mother recently made she used oil in them because people swore they tasted alot better NOT i didnt like them at all
5913 2018-01-01 04:28:26 I like that. Any ideas what we'd raise?!... How about an overflowing oil derrick?... A giant crawfish?...
5914 2018-01-01 04:28:25 That is the thing people tend to forget. They were terrible for a long time to get those players & Chiarelli came in and decided to move them along like they were nothing. If only he had suffered through the pain...

5922 2018-01-01 04:26:35 Larsson, by his nature, is allowed very few bad games. He’s expected to be a steadying presence, that’s his value. Unacceptable.

5928 2018-01-01 04:25:12 Bloomberg views on energy efficiency and susequent decline in oil consumption sound a realistic assessment of future consumption patterns.Otherwise too it is imperative for our survival.
5929 2018-01-01 04:25:01 I could have used my heating pad and rubbed my belly with peppermint oil a long time ago
5930 2018-01-01 04:24:55 Ok. I’m picturing chalky bits floating around in oil.

5933 2018-01-01 04:24:14 Even if I didn’t it still doesn’t change the science. 

Using your argument climate change isn’t real because the Koch’s are still drilling for oil.
5934 2018-01-01 04:23:56 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

It's killer 

I also know of a joint that has prime rib that will make you faint
5941 2018-01-01 04:21:37 Huh. When I lived in Illinois the water everywhere had a strong iron taste.
I don't think they use olive oil or mozzerella in Chicago style and the dough is just bread dough. Real abomination.
5942 2018-01-01 04:21:20 Called myself putting on some oil before I came in the crib so I wouldn’t be dank. That was a fail.

5955 2018-01-01 04:19:35 Yes & no. From an Oilers perspective, it was b/c  they usually had zero functional size on their roster. You could see last season the game had changed & the bigger teams in the Pacific started to struggle. Look at LA no longer play that same style & now they're winning again.

5958 2018-01-01 04:19:05 I melted butter in a big metal roasting pan, coated drumsticks in butter; salted. Brush on seasoning: chopped garlic whisked with olive oil, avocado oil, Italian herbs, chipotle pepper powder. Start at 425 for 10 minutes, turn down to 325, let it go for at least an hour.+

C'mon people, stop being led along by the neocon warmongers.
5971 2018-01-01 04:16:08 Not really. Especially when most people fail to see that 90% of the calories on most of these demonised carb dishes are from loads of cheese and oil.
5972 2018-01-01 04:15:52 Ok. That’s really inexpensive. I might try it. I just need to figure out which oil I like.

5990 2018-01-01 04:11:42 Not sure how this anointing oil is going to fair with ‘clear skin 2018’
5991 2018-01-01 04:11:37 cause of climate change our clouds will have oil in um then when we pop fireworks our sky will be on fire, wow
5992 2018-01-01 04:11:37 put some lavender oil in my oil diffuser and binge watching bones until I fall asleep. happy new years
5993 2018-01-01 04:11:35 Had a toothache for a bit over a month ago. Visited dentist, clear xray and perfect bill of dental health but still given an rx antibiotic mouthwash with a follow up visit mid Jan. In short, abscess in tooth burst today. No clove oil... no whiskey.  Ouch. And gross. Sup, 2018?
5994 2018-01-01 04:11:16 Wow I rung in 2017 poppin oxy and ending it with a natural oil diffuser and herbal tea. Learned a lot in 2017. Became comfortable in my own skin in 2017. You don't need anyone else. Hope y'all healthy. Godspeed in 2018.
5995 2018-01-01 04:11:16 Wow. This should make every Oil fan angry or at least very sad. Our head coach comes just short of admitting he has absolutely no idea how to fix the teams poor performance.  I'm sick of winning the draft, I want to win The Cup. Heads should roll, sooner rather than later.
5996 2018-01-01 04:11:15 Most of the Hall nonsense came after the trade. That’s why it’s such BS. Also: Hawks never traded Patrick Kane for known off ice issues. Did that pay off?
5997 2018-01-01 04:11:14 Makes sense. It’s pretty much water in a bottle. Just need a heavy cream or oil to seal it in.

6001 2018-01-01 04:11:04 Only in Iran, because in Saudi Arabia 'Murica doesn't really care about those things right? Well, to be fare, you like Saudi's oil to much to care about the human rights violations in that country...
6002 2018-01-01 04:10:53 There's this insane neocon belief that if we squint juuuuuuust right at a dictator he'll flinch, hand over his natural resources to an American oil company, and transition to democracy without any civilian deaths or cost to US taxpayers.
Like I say, insane.

6007 2018-01-01 04:10:16 Epsom salt baths ,  doterra oil chest rub & my vics humidifier following with snuggles & movies this NYE. I'm over being sick 
6008 2018-01-01 04:10:09 きびしい
6009 2018-01-01 04:09:03 I wasnt referring to just the Pacific but before you start rambling off their stellar record this season, look at who they've played to this point. Let's wait on that one.
6010 2018-01-01 04:08:40 Canadian Conservatives are a fraud. They copied the liberal philosophy to gain power-"The Big Shift" . Name one good thing that came out of the Harper era? He rode the oil boom and then it busted and there was nothing left. And Kenney kissing immigrants asses for votes. Fail.
6011 2018-01-01 04:08:34 True. But you already live close to oil / coal burners which are almost certainly shortening your life. Overall, oil and coal are hugely more dangerous than nukes, but we don't notice as the effect is insidious, not acute. Like noticing plane crashes but not the road toll.
6012 2018-01-01 04:08:16 You just have to make sure the oil is 100% pure!! It's a little pricey but you only need a few drops in a spray bottle and it'll be way safer for your cats in the long run.
6013 2018-01-01 04:08:00 Tell me more about this rosehip oil 
6014 2018-01-01 04:07:46 Shero would laugh and hang up the phone.
6015 2018-01-01 04:07:41 やろうかな…給料入ったら考えようかな…！
6016 2018-01-01 04:07:39 Dear Nnpc and oil marketers plz stop fine tuning a lie 4 us, better fine tune the truth for us to see the clear picture.
6017 2018-01-01 04:07:28 if you know of a place in the Vancouver Lower Mainland that serves Seasoned Truffle Oil Tator Tots. THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.
6018 2018-01-01 04:07:18 Go kyla castor oil na HAHAHAHA
6019 2018-01-01 04:07:13 We have an issue with an acquisition cost.

I also have a problem with people making up bullshit narratives to justify the deal ("Larsson embraced the city in a way Hall never did", "Hall was bad in the room"), but some minds are easily fooled by such drek.
6020 2018-01-01 04:07:07 This one girl put a lot of oil in her hair before dying it blonde and she said it didn't damage her hair cause the oil protected it
6021 2018-01-01 04:07:04 Happy new year Will just unknowingly took a shot of olive oil and now the room is chaos
6022 2018-01-01 04:06:57 Citrus oils have acidity for cleaning but smell nicer than vinegar. You can get essential oils from hokey crystal healing places from the oil burner section just check to make sure it's 100% pure. Some are more expensive than others you only need a few drops in a spray bottle.
6023 2018-01-01 04:06:53 it started with the US CIA overthrowing democratically elected Mossadegh in 1953 because of oil and putting Shah Mohammad Pahlavi as a dictator and US marionette onto the thrown who was finally overthrown by popular revolt in 1979.
6024 2018-01-01 04:06:34 i have my "uplifting" essential oil diffusing and I'm ready to pass the FUCK out.. happy 2018 bitches
6025 2018-01-01 04:06:24 I keep telling y’all she drinks motor oil and her teeth look like sunflower seeds
6026 2018-01-01 04:06:13 Ugh. My mom has been trying to heat mostly with her wood stove to avoid a huge fuel oil bill (wood is next to free here), but that's been difficult because you have to let the fire die down to empty all the ashes occasionally.
6027 2018-01-01 04:06:07 And Timothy McVeigh had one vehicle with some fertilizer and oil and killed 168 people and injured 680

6029 2018-01-01 04:06:00 55 minutes left and I’m dedicating it to a nice shower followed by apricot & fig body oil. happy New Year’s Eve.
6030 2018-01-01 04:05:57 #India needs to adopt #solar and #ev electric vehicles and eliminate crude oil import and coal import. Crude oil import from Muslim countries is 2 Times size of Defence budget. This way we won’t have any obligation to Arabs when voting for Israel. Also all pollution will vanish
6031 2018-01-01 04:05:26 While international sanctions have certainly damaged the economy, they have hardly brought it to its knees. Oil will always be a backstop. Sanctions have only hurt ordinary people mostly as basic goods become more difficult to obtain.
6032 2018-01-01 04:05:20 To this day, the thing that bothers me is it sounds like those of us who've never liked the deal have an issue w/ Larsson & nothing could be further from the truth.

6034 2018-01-01 04:04:49 I’m having this urge to fry up some onion rings, but then I realize that I’ll have to cut the onion mix the batter and heat up oil.....tomorrow
6035 2018-01-01 04:04:41 I think what everyone is failing to comment on is last year was over achieving.  The oil are exactly where they should be.  Look at the lack of talent.
6036 2018-01-01 04:04:22 yessss use argan oil its realllyyyy helpful
6037 2018-01-01 04:04:17 bruh left the crib wit the vape full new coil full battery, to check my pocket full of oil , idk why the fuck my coil keeps breaking....

6060 2018-01-01 03:59:45 I've heard the lottery described as an extremely risky investment, like wildcat oil well drilling. Will probably never pay off, but pays off big if it ever does. Treated that way, it could be part of a balanced investment portfolio.
6061 2018-01-01 03:59:41 You do realize that it's only because of the British and oil that the US gov't ended up on the side of the Salafis/Sunnis/Arabs, right? We have more in common with Shia/Persians.

1. Stop buying oils from the beauty supply. Get them from the market (coconut, argan, tea tree, almond,  olive oil.

3. hot oil treatments are your friend.
4. Clip ends when necessary

6144 2018-01-01 03:46:25 This misconception everyone has of the Pacific kills me. Yes the Oilers needed to add some size but the reason they routinely lost to those teams was b/c the roster wasn't good enough. Always about depth.
6145 2018-01-01 03:46:08 Yeah, as usual, the team giving up the best player loses the 2-for-1 trade!

6161 2018-01-01 03:42:45 @TheEconomist leak one investment story to show what you offer to increase prescriptions. Idk what you offer. Good story tho on Russia and EU buying oil.
6162 2018-01-01 03:42:37 Not a big Rhodes fan, these two posts aren't contradictory or ironic And we should all consider the weapons we sell to Saudi. Don't think those land in terrorists' hands? And the oil money?
6163 2018-01-01 03:42:25 I just received your products as a #Christmas gift. I can’t wait to try Beard oil, wash, & scruff cream #NewCustomer

6175 2018-01-01 03:40:42 Happy New Year’s Eve. Can you help us fight the big oil companies?  Thank you!!
6176 2018-01-01 03:40:30 Bet they are all gathered around in someone’s multi million dollar estate smoking Cuban cigars, sipping expensive brandy and cheering everytime oil increases in price.

6183 2018-01-01 03:38:28 also interested in reducing shale oil in  as viable alternative. But it’s all good if oil keeps flowing out of & MBS helps against

6189 2018-01-01 03:37:20 Well, I think you’re on the right track, but I believe it’s deeper than that. Many of our federal politicians are indebted to oil conglomerates. Take our Sec. of State Tillerson: Frm. CEO Exxon-Mobile. We need to get money out of politics to open up market
6190 2018-01-01 03:37:15 I rather be laid up getting Kushy and sipping some oil but whatever

6203 2018-01-01 03:34:20 Best way is to go solar and get all electric vehicles and stop sale of non-electric vehicles. Will bankrupt Arabs and end oil funded terror. Even Pakistan will suffer as Saudi funding will END. As for Venezuela not possible as socialist govt is unstable and can seize oil
6204 2018-01-01 03:34:19 World needs to think why they are bound to use USA dollar in international market for every trade. For oil alsaud family to blame

6209 2018-01-01 03:33:42 Yes ,that why they are buying Cheap US oil and bringing in METRO and planning for Electric Vehicles  for long term growth.
6210 2018-01-01 03:33:33 Why do Instagram make up artists put SO MUCH OIL on their faces

6215 2018-01-01 03:33:27 independent research states that once El Trumpo issues alternative facts, a butterly subscibes to the #NYT
6216 2018-01-01 03:33:03 As you said, what does that have to do with what we’re talking about? What does it have to do with Iran other than wild speculation? There’s a lot going on in the ME and Ukraine is very strategic because of its oil pipes and location. Doesn’t necessarily mean he’s deep state.
6217 2018-01-01 03:32:55 I’m sorry it’s just a miracle oil
6218 2018-01-01 03:32:28 What are health benefits from frankincense oil? Is it 100% natural or added by synthetic solvent? Thank you
6219 2018-01-01 03:32:19 He didn’t mention Russia delivering oil products to N Korea.
6220 2018-01-01 03:32:12 Is not even that they lost tonight. The fact it was 5-0 in a must have type game is pretty telling #oil
6221 2018-01-01 03:32:04 He came for Oil then, as seen in this clip. Today, he’s there talking Oil everyday. Nothing else. He likes the Oil so much that he’s spending billions searching for it in Lake Chad.
6222 2018-01-01 03:32:01 5 Billion from cash to untraceable assets, any precious metal, oil, diamonds, Bitcoins, and any other thing you can think off . So all Hillary had to do when Comey came out with the conclusion. Were he had just said that Hillary lied to congress under oath, if she

More like between the chicken and the egg, which comes first?
You would be shocked to note that a good chunk of what was used to develop Nigeria wasn't from taxes but from direct oil money.
If more people pay taxes, we would have more asking for accountability

6248 2018-01-01 03:28:18 It wasn't allowed to sell oil for many decades. Heck it wasn't even allowed to buy tech from West to drill oil. If similar sanctions were put on Hindus I shudder to think how backward they would be if they are so backward today.
6249 2018-01-01 03:28:05 It’s not a church service if they don’t slap your forehead with anointing oil
6250 2018-01-01 03:27:59 With the new law, the U.S. government will allow oil drilling in a portion of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. An Obama-era policy put a 40-year ban on energy development in this remote area. But yea, let's just call it a tax bill, so we can sucker Americans with it.
6251 2018-01-01 03:27:15 Oh, @ckuaradio, leave it to you guys to broadcast a giant downer evening on New Year's Eve. I can always count on you to be the cod liver oil, rectal exam, Aunt Griselda "eat this liver, it's good for you" of the radio.

6264 2018-01-01 03:24:36 I've got a question -- if china promised to not sell nk oil but did it anyway, isn't it a good thing the USA got out of the Paris Accords where they weren't actually required to adhere to their benchmarks.

6278 2018-01-01 03:22:55 @chefsymon do I have to “reseason” my cast iron skillet every time I use it or can I just gently wash, dry and rub vegetable oil over it and that’s it to retain it? @thechew thank you!
6279 2018-01-01 03:22:32 OH please - your drama is quite pathetic. Oil prices were crashing before the NDP got into office. Coal is a dying industry, and has been for years. What child and senior programs do you want cut? What educational programs? Health programs? Come on - defend your comment.

6285 2018-01-01 03:21:18 Lavender, tea tree oil, and orange tend to help me feel better. The lavender relaxes me, the tea tree and orange make me happy. Plus tea tree, when rubbed on achy muscles, helps with aches.

6287 2018-01-01 03:21:08 Pakistani trained terrorists are armed with Western weapons and dispatched all over central Asia to block oil pipelines from reaching new markets...good value for money (if you have an oil monopoly to protect)

6293 2018-01-01 03:19:52 Democracy in Iran, then why did the CIA overthrow a democratically elected leader in 1953 in order to reclaim the nationalized oil industry. Same reason you said you would bomb Iran because they are abandoning the petrodollar.

6300 2018-01-01 03:18:38 Last year this time #Kirkuk was a thriving Kurdish, Arab, Christian, and Turkmen city. Now it's an Arab city where Arabization is taking place. Kurdish homes and businesses are being looted, burned/blown. You allowed it because you were afraid of KRG selling oil to the Russians.
6301 2018-01-01 03:18:13 We don’t want to start going yet, but keep the oil in the engine
6302 2018-01-01 03:18:07 You 45 could make America great again by fessing up to your collusion or whatever name you want to call answering to Putin every whim. We are following the oil/money trail.  You lie but you are not devious enough to deal with KGB prodigy Putin.

6305 2018-01-01 03:17:39 I like both, but I need to get an essential oil diffuser at some point. But I like to wear oils, they help with anxiety & depression, depending on the oil. Lately my anxiety and depression levels have been off the charts.
6306 2018-01-01 03:17:34 That is good for the businesses and individuals who produced the oil and consumed it.  To hell with the State.  The State has no rights to the money.

6315 2018-01-01 03:15:43 Sadly I did mean it both ways. Does the magic coconut oil mean weed? 4 hours and 45 minutes to legality!
6316 2018-01-01 03:15:42 Today I made an impromptu body scrub from cheap coconut oil, instant coffee, and sugar. Not only is my skin super soft but an unintended result was the scrub smelled like steak marinated in Dale's sauce in the shower.
6317 2018-01-01 03:15:03 Garlic pills tell your immune system to get the heck up. Also Oregano Oil, I don't even remember what it does but 3 drops under the tongue is like holy water. helps the throat, clears your nasal passage and stuff idk this is my mom area of expertise. XD Sorry that you feel sucky
6318 2018-01-01 03:14:59 McLellan has his flaws but when it's a roster construction issue, which is what this is, that falls back on the GM.

6320 2018-01-01 03:14:44 That $700 Billion works out to > $5,000 per US taxpayer.  Putting out record wildfires and recovering from record flooding isn’t cheap.  Still think oil's "efficient"?
6321 2018-01-01 03:14:38 He is running from the fact that China and Russia are selling oil to North Korea. He cant deal with that because both presidents own him
6322 2018-01-01 03:14:34 I don't think so. If they thought they could get away with it the U.S. would have already. Russia is the key to why many of these states are still floating. Strategic, first strike, oil enriched, areas will be carved out by powerful states and one can't have them all.

6353 2018-01-01 03:08:39 そうでもなかった
6354 2018-01-01 03:08:36 100%...they have plenty of nice pieces but the roster doesn't work as constructed. No winger depth and I'm tired of talking about the D...not a good look on the GM.
6355 2018-01-01 03:07:48 Oil not matching up well against a deep Jets team.  Happy for Hendricks.  Wish he was with the Oil
6356 2018-01-01 03:07:45 @aromatherapy01 Wooow great information on essential oil aplication especially as aromatherapy, we can discuss about essential oil application especially from Indonesia. We have expeeience more than 12 years on essential oil research.

6360 2018-01-01 03:07:05 The issue is an unbalanced and poorly constructed roster. The flaws were apparent in camp & GM decided to address none...most notably the Sekera issue. When you combine that w/ their poor start, confidence has become an issue & these guys aren't dumb...they see the standings.

6377 2018-01-01 03:03:49 This is why I've been harping for the better part of a month that a double-digit win streak is a necessity. Playing .700ish hockey over the course of a few months, w/out an extened run, is nearly impossible in today's NHL.
6378 2018-01-01 03:03:40 You saw effort out there tonight? No your right, it’s not all an effort thing but you can’t win if you don’t care to. Yes wheeler is great, but the 2 D they have out also play a tonne of minutes. So what’s the issue? Talent? Nope....leadership? Shouldn’t be.....thoughts?

6384 2018-01-01 03:02:39 "oil my muzzleloader"? Is that what the kids are calling it now?

6394 2018-01-01 03:01:44 Well, that ain't the dumbest thing I ever heard but it is very bad advice.  Unless you want to freeze your ass off, the heater needs to be going, the windshield has to clear, and just taking off and driving before the oil warms up can hurt the motor.  Yappy who near.
6395 2018-01-01 03:01:31 Firing himself would be a good start.

6399 2018-01-01 03:01:00 I have seen this team compete with and beat some very good teams this year. I do not believe they are a bad team at all.

6401 2018-01-01 03:00:50 One of the first times trump tried to run, he gave a speech in Boca Raton, Florida at a Tea Party rally saying we should’ve taken and should still take Iran’s oil. I believe the speech is on record too and was in the paper.
6402 2018-01-01 03:00:50 Hoping it’s just a reaction to the oil from their fryer. But yea. Onto hot pronto!

6408 2018-01-01 02:59:57 Pumpkin butt essential oil!!! It’s 100% safe and a GOD SEND. You just rub it on their gums
6409 2018-01-01 02:59:35 It's not an effort issue and the Jets weren't missing their two best players...one yes but Blake Wheeler says hello

6414 2018-01-01 02:58:46 Mmm! These are good options! I've been doing what Sarah suggested: taking make up off via oil based cleanser (Lush's Ultrabland) and then using (a Neutrogena Naturals) salicylic acid cleanser which has been really working for me (I used to only do one or the other)

6419 2018-01-01 02:58:00 Coal does not compete with oil.
6420 2018-01-01 02:57:58 Which enemies exactly?  How’s North Korea doing with that oil from Russia and China?  Isis?  Nope still around. Can you stop gagging long enough to reply?

6426 2018-01-01 02:56:56 And one team had it’s top 2 players out, Oilers really aren’t good.....Just heartless effort by all. Watching Tampa play tonight they are light years ahead of this team. Not a single comparison.

6434 2018-01-01 02:56:11 The damed up growth was to grow green jobs and promote only solar and wind energy. Obama’s dam subsidized (attempt to socialize) Solendra while killing coal, US Steel, American rare earths (see 60 Minutes), and cut America off from cheap Canadian oil for more expensive OPEC.

6441 2018-01-01 02:55:09 Hahaha oil n gas ehh baik sikit

6489 2018-01-01 02:48:54 Have to think a change is needed after this #Oilers lack of effort. How can players show up so flat/uncommitted when the season is dangling by threads? Outshot on PP’s by the short handed team 
Love the #Oil but something has to give for season to end with any positivity

6492 2018-01-01 02:48:34 And Norway exports 1.2 of the 1.6M they produce.  It's irrelevant to the situation, because how much oil we export doesn't indicate how much fuel we consume. Unless you think that all the gas that goes in your car comes from the pumpjack down the road, in which case I can't help.

I was not a big fan of his (the handling of the gas rights with East Timor was disgraceful) but AWB scandal...nope.

New price is 2.04 riyals/liter
Which is U.S. 55 ¢/ liter
Which is .55 × 4.6 = U.S $2.5 /gallon
That's too expensive for an oil producing country!!!

6586 2018-01-01 02:37:26 Idk. Seems like my worst fear has been the military industrial complex, a government that believes oil is our future, that coal can be "washed". A national absence of common sense. NK just announced it's nuclear ready.

6591 2018-01-01 02:36:38 #Oilers  A brutal finish to 2017 for all the die hard oil faithful! No chance for playoff run, nothing in this game indicated any hope!
6592 2018-01-01 02:36:30 A guy has a better chance of winning the 50/50 then the oilers winning a hockey game
6593 2018-01-01 02:36:29 Ah, yes let’s talk about gas prices. Like why do they randomly jump 9 cents at a time overnight? Perhaps because a conservative government thought out sourcing all our oil/gas resources to US based companies to make a dollar was the way to go?
6594 2018-01-01 02:36:25 新年早々なにしてるんですか…
6595 2018-01-01 02:36:05 Do they burn all of the oil they produce? No. Simply pulling the fuel out of the ground isn't the sole activity that produces GHG's.  The actual use of the fuel, in industry, is a large factor.
6596 2018-01-01 02:36:03 Bro as long as you get annoiting oil, that's all you need
6597 2018-01-01 02:35:57 It's Canada oil!!! They had to rename it because no one wanted to buy rapeseed oil. And that's "the rest of the story" :)

6600 2018-01-01 02:35:31 Exactly what i did oshi. Haha
6601 2018-01-01 02:35:04 By lifting 'burdensome' regulations from the backs of those nice people at the oil companies so they can carry on business without pesky government oversight.
6602 2018-01-01 02:34:59 I’ve been putting vitamin e oil on my face after my moisturizer when i do my makeup for a year and it’s noticeably made me skin more glowy, i’ve also had less breakouts. It doesn’t make my skin too oily either. Everyones different but i do recommend trying it!
6603 2018-01-01 02:34:37 2) Check the tires, the fluid levels, the cleanliness of the oil. When looking at the engine, look for oil leaks. Drive with the radio OFF. Listen to the engine. Drive it about 5-10 mph on a flat surface, take your hands off the wheel and brake. Does the truck pull L or R?

6610 2018-01-01 02:33:47 Yup. Only 4:30 here.... I've been toasting every hour for the last 8. Hope I can make another 7.5 
6611 2018-01-01 02:33:34 I assumed I had oily skin for 22 years until I tried that test I tweeted about! Now that I use stuff to keep my skin moisturized, I don’t feel oily. So I use the argan oil right after toner, then I use a hyaluronic acid from The Ordinary- but basically look for hyaluronic
6612 2018-01-01 02:33:32 The oil market listens to the fast and furious, not to the wise men like @Big_Orrin and @HFI_Research
6613 2018-01-01 02:33:25 Meanwhile Norway produces three times the oil we do per capita, but with half our GHG per capita. 
Norway: 1,647,975 bbl Oil/day for 5.2M people = .31 bbl per capita
Canada: 3,662,694 bbl Oil/day for 36M people = .10 bbl per capita.

Any more excuses? #abpoli #ableg
6614 2018-01-01 02:33:15 By adding between a third to a cup of the most neutral flavored vegetable oil you have. That’ll fix up *future* attempts. Always preheat! Happy holidays

6619 2018-01-01 02:32:43 One of the worst GMs in the league and one of the most overrated coaches, what a way for the Oil to ring in the new year!
6620 2018-01-01 02:32:05 An oil & gas and mining toady...
6621 2018-01-01 02:32:00 Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock,
6622 2018-01-01 02:31:47 Coming from a college student, I’d say the best would be:

Start with the stove burner on mid heat or slightly higher. Put cooking oil in the pan, but enough to just cover the surface after rubbing it on the surface.

Maybe each side first 5 Mom each then alternate
6623 2018-01-01 02:31:34 Zレジェンドってなんだよ。
6624 2018-01-01 02:31:16 We better be getting someone really nice because this is an extremely deep draft and at this point the oil are looking at a top 10 possibly top 5 pick. Also there’s a couple players who would be NHL ready.
6625 2018-01-01 02:31:15 [looks at peng and oil scores] luv 2 start the year as we mean 2 go on 
6626 2018-01-01 02:31:12 Exactly.  He hasn’t been relevant all season
6627 2018-01-01 02:30:43 DID YOU KNOW? decades ago was proposal to put REFINERY in Yuma, AZ. Pipeline from Mex to Yuma to carry oil. Would have brought down price of gas on W COAST 20 cents per gallon. OIL COMPANIES smashed the idea. EVEN the ENVIRONMENTALIST approved of the idea. WHAT does that tell you
6628 2018-01-01 02:30:26 Congrats to tonight's @EdmontonOilers 50/50 winner Deanna Wenger who's taking home $80,332.50 with ticket 193377C. Thanks for supporting St. Albert Minor Hockey!

6630 2018-01-01 02:30:26 Oil market never good at seeing its faults or problem quickly. That is why it is cyclic in nature.

6634 2018-01-01 02:29:03 Canadian Tire carries Garrison Oil Heaters. It’s indoor safe! Use it to heat the garage so my Koi don’t get to coldWe also use Garrison air conditioners in the summer. I think it’s on it’s fourth year and works the same as new.

6638 2018-01-01 02:28:34 Let's see Billie boy economic sanctions well we red states have most of the oil and food stocks it's going to be hard if we impose boycotts by not shipping those products into ur environmentally concerned states what's good 4 the goose is good 4 the gander
6639 2018-01-01 02:28:26 Oh “with” you want help? Also history is exactly that HISTORY.  NOT current! Please google solar power and fracking. It’s what we do now. Keep your cheep oil.  #FreeIran #IranProtest We are for the freedom of the people.
6640 2018-01-01 02:28:20 Tbh I always assumed I had oily skin because with makeup came the oil. Used Shea butter once as face moisturizer and I broke out literally. Not sure anything works for me 
6641 2018-01-01 02:27:59 Us long time  Jets fans need this kind of game results to make up for many years of suffering to the Oil.  Have to admit i love it.

6652 2018-01-01 02:24:48 Shea butter is good for my hair but just sits on my skin. Even when I ship it. I be ashy and greasy. I add almond oil to my cocoa butter and that works for me

6656 2018-01-01 02:24:09 Americans have become so phenomenally stupid it hurts. The best part: ”The most prominent proponent of raw water is” the guy who dreamed up Juicero—that should tell u something about the snake oil content of this product
6657 2018-01-01 02:24:06 New year, mega blessings, lasting laughter, more contracts,more oil! Thank you GOD
6658 2018-01-01 02:24:04 Snake oil salesman! Tick tock
6659 2018-01-01 02:23:48 maybe when your interpretation of Lenin leads you to support Euromaidan and Scholarists, but not states being Balkanized by the United States so it can seize their oil, you have gone wrong somewhere along the line
6660 2018-01-01 02:23:45 Spec, first time in over thirty years, (including the Decade of Despair!) that I’ve turned the Oil game off. Totally disheartened and disgusted.
6661 2018-01-01 02:23:45 The Oil must be having one hell of a New Year's party, playing like thats whats on their minds tonight.
6662 2018-01-01 02:23:45 Got Oil of Olay for Christmas. Tossing it. Your ad against police is dangerous and shocking. Shame.
6663 2018-01-01 02:23:44 wtf do those flavors have to do with wrestling?

6666 2018-01-01 02:23:26 Oil em up.  Just to break the stereotype though,  make sure they're all bald headed with extreme body hair
6667 2018-01-01 02:23:24 Before 2017 ends, for my niggas, stop stunting all the time. Niggas be lying they ass off, even to fellow niggas. “Mane you chopped bruh”
“Bruh I ain’t had a haircut in a week my shit just like that” 
Nigga the hair still on your collar; I smell the oil sheen

6672 2018-01-01 02:22:56 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.

6674 2018-01-01 02:21:44 Think he must be a Welsh Tory, apparently this particular oil isn't Scottish, belongs to anyone but the Scots of course. We best get back in our box and be thankful that Westminster has been cleaning up the North Sea for us all this time.

6680 2018-01-01 02:20:27 Well too bad  we totally support your freedom fighters. You can’t hardly give oil away here. It’s like what $ 1.00 a barrel. Like I said keep that . We use solar. Check it out. Nobody want shit from Iran except to free the people from that toilet paper around their heads
6681 2018-01-01 02:20:23 Craig has become obsessed with Olbus Oil since we have been ill and now the fucking bedroom stinks of it every night where he puts it on our pillow and WE ARENT EVEN ILL ANYMORE
6682 2018-01-01 02:20:15 He should have shown something the last 5 seconds of the 2nd and kept that 4-0 goal from being a thing.

6691 2018-01-01 02:18:34 If the fraking for oil they loosing money..fraking is rather expensive.
6692 2018-01-01 02:18:06 Regarding the bits about Gove and Boris, for example, the Single Market was in their own TORY MANIFESTO. 
Stop trying to fudge it. It's long gone time since we worked out you were selling snake oil. 
#stopbrexit will happen.
6693 2018-01-01 02:18:00 In addition to oil/fat types ... Which I agree makes a huge difference ...  I think there's certain genetic and/or physiological traits that cause variance among individuals and even populations as well.
6694 2018-01-01 02:17:51 im sure they didnt want the public to know that there is a oil bath system in those,,

6707 2018-01-01 02:14:26 Going into the new year with a fresh set, coconut oil on skin looking smooth and radiant, coochie sugared and lashes on securely, and sipping on champagne, I’m set.
6708 2018-01-01 02:14:22 Dafuq are the Oil doing? Mandatory bed time right after the game, no going to the ranch
6709 2018-01-01 02:14:14 Nothing tastes better then fried potatos after cooking a pambazo and some of the chorizo fell into the oil 
6710 2018-01-01 02:14:14 #triggered lol none of these assumptions are true. You’re arguments are simplistic and unresearched. You probably believed that the Harper Gov would have finished their projected budget in a surplus after their one trick economy collapsed with 40$ oil.
6711 2018-01-01 02:14:13 Bro...then It was Afghans, then Iraq, then Libya, Syria is on way... what is common,,, not religion... OIL... see the price of protest...nation paid... society paid...take care of your own people...

6731 2018-01-01 02:11:04 Absolutely. The man practically exudes that snake oil salesmen vibe... And worse.
6732 2018-01-01 02:11:03 It means someone is about to try and sell you some snake oil.
6733 2018-01-01 02:10:52 I strongly support the freedom protesters of #Iran but let’s make it clear -We don’t want your oil! We have solar power. Don’t get it twisted. Keep it. We recycle  & renew

6742 2018-01-01 02:07:54 I’ll give it a shot! I know they say your hair starts producing less oil so it evens out, I just really don’t want to look like an extra in Grease. Thanks for all the tips!
6743 2018-01-01 02:07:53 big oil made a deal back in 68 with the analyticals man
6744 2018-01-01 02:07:49 Hmm... I wonder how much India is working on this. Maybe it's secretly happening (esp if Doval has freedom to act). 

(Biggest help IMO would be Saudi running out of oil But free Balochistan is important too).

6752 2018-01-01 02:07:06 —I DEF. couldn’t do this without using the cleansing conditioner every time I shower, which has actual cleansers in it. Theoretically (mine seems to have!) your scalp is supposed to adjust and produce oil differently/less once you cut out sulfate stuff

6755 2018-01-01 02:06:59 If we cannot say no to the numerous requests placed on us and yes to prioritizing time to connect with the Lord, our lamps will go out, our oil will be gone, and we will not be effective to anyone.
6756 2018-01-01 02:06:50 Nonsense @SPNigeria after 50 years of #Biafra Genocide war for crude oil, Still fuel scarcity? What a shame. #BiafraExit via Referéndum, Biafrans decide. The people's right to determine their future is what is non-negotiable. #BiafraReferendum 2018 @realDonaldTrump.
6757 2018-01-01 02:06:32 I just want that purp keep that oil you drinking

6761 2018-01-01 02:06:20 I hate that I’m ending/starting the year sick. Hate it even more that the Oil r going down hard.  @EdmontonOilers #HappyNewYear #HappyNewYear2018 #HappyNewYearOilerFans
6762 2018-01-01 02:05:55 bananas wit baby oil >>>
6763 2018-01-01 02:05:47 i mean they just don't use the oil sometimes! crazy!
6764 2018-01-01 02:05:24 In the free marketplace of ideas, I sell snake oil that sometimes actually works.

Also, "marketplace of ideas" is fuxking cringey as fuck, stop saying it in 2018.

6768 2018-01-01 02:04:30 Plastic, foam, textile, rubber, contain oil, petrol, gas, or diesel. Does that answer the scientist’s inquisitive mind? Also close proximity and the commutative heat build up. To contain petrol or oil based fires I’d expect to need foam, water would just spread contamination

6770 2018-01-01 02:04:24 we have a low appreciation for the oil in this household and i just don't understand. i tell them if they don't use the oil make regular raman
6771 2018-01-01 02:04:19 Such a sad situation. Who's going to suffer when the North's oil supplies dwindle? Certainly not the elite, it will be the little guys. I realize the sanctions are warranted but.....
6772 2018-01-01 02:04:00 @JasonGregor I have a penalties theory. Oil don't draw penalties in the offense zone corner like other teams because they only have one player who is a threat down low. All the others just throw semi-blind low percentage passes into the slot. Defend there and no need to scrum.
6773 2018-01-01 02:03:31 So yummy! Had all the fondues- cheese with bread and broiled broccolli then hot oil for steak and chicken and now the chocolate fondue-my favorite!

6776 2018-01-01 02:03:03 Nah but I have dry/sensitive skin & I get bad breakouts anytime I use too much oil/moisturizer on my skin (those korean skincare stuff with snail stuff too) and my skin goes tomato red and feels like a sunburn if a cleanser uses propolis

6782 2018-01-01 02:01:35 @realDonaldTrump china shamelessly supplying oil, arms, military and nuke technologies to NK and Pakistan like terrorists - enemies of US. What are you thinking - India is your only answer?
6783 2018-01-01 02:01:26 #Hoodoo Road Opener Shaker Jar

You'll need a jar, a key, road opener oil, some dried corn, amethyst, pyrite, citrine, lapis lazuli, bay leaf, and cinnamon. 
Write a petition. Anoint with oil including the key. Bless your ingredients. Ask God to help you. Add them all to the jar.
6784 2018-01-01 02:01:19 My new oil hits at 90%. Shit is crazy.
6785 2018-01-01 02:01:19 True!

6788 2018-01-01 02:00:43 I've had best luck with canola oil in the pan, but pure olive oil does work. Extra virgin smoke point is too low though
6789 2018-01-01 02:00:39 And Russell isn't very good.
6790 2018-01-01 02:00:39 This coconut oil got me HOT
6791 2018-01-01 02:00:36 Keep yourself metered on butter and you can smoke tobacco to no end. Butter is a very light oil. Gets underneath shitty density.
6792 2018-01-01 02:00:10 @Mr_Rebecca
Option 1: oil (veg etc) on tissue & pressure application. Much like removing a temp tat.
Option 2: PVA glue it up and peel it "primary school skin style".
Option 3: E45 or lotion and a squeegee.
Option four: hire yourselves out as portable disco accessories 
6793 2018-01-01 01:59:53 yeah there's oil! when i was a kid, i ruined a pack because i thought it was like regular noodles (with broth) and didn't drain... it was like dropping my ice cream on the floor when i found out
6794 2018-01-01 01:59:47 Been bad all year
6795 2018-01-01 01:59:44 My humble unsolicited suggestion: Sous vide that business for 2.5 hours at 130 and sear the hell out of it afterward. Salt, pepper, garlic, shallots, red wine, and olive oil in the bag. You'll remember me forever.
6796 2018-01-01 01:59:35 Well next time make sure there’s oil in your car
6797 2018-01-01 01:59:34 No sir
6798 2018-01-01 01:59:29 Do they have enough oil for the seance?
6799 2018-01-01 01:59:23 Truth.
6800 2018-01-01 01:59:15 Exactly what I said ..... unbelievable
6801 2018-01-01 01:59:13 He's not wrong.
6802 2018-01-01 01:59:03 i hope to like at least one of the 2, because finding that flavor of indo mie is easier than the special chicken flavor w/the oil

6807 2018-01-01 01:58:28 seeing that there are TWO types of mi goreng indo mies, i think i can do it. does it also come with the oil?
6808 2018-01-01 01:58:18 @anasalhajji you think we get one more significant pull back in oil...say mid or low 40s in 2018 or are the bulls off to the races?
6809 2018-01-01 01:58:04 Yeah. Said he's been dogshit for 3 games.
6810 2018-01-01 01:57:55 Mmmmm.... garlic dogs are delicious. All you need to do is finely chop garlic, oil it up, and throw your hot dogs in the pan as the garlic cooks.

As you roll them around, the cooking garlic will candy onto to them and continue Browning. 
6811 2018-01-01 01:57:53 Happy New Year to the First Family by the way governor pay no mind to the nasty comments we know better just wear some of Pedro Javier's baby oil and let it all slide.Blessings.

6816 2018-01-01 01:56:15 My lashes are sooo short from 4 months of extensions...I’m going into hiding now until this castor oil restores me lol

6825 2018-01-01 01:53:59 Yup. Listening to this shit show in Cancun. More specifically said his last three games have been not good.
6826 2018-01-01 01:53:57 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
6827 2018-01-01 01:53:53 Gov Susana is not too popular, and #PearceforNM isn't either. So glad he's leaving Congress. Oil hasn't yet bought the whole state, so he won't be Gov. #GoodByeSteve #NOPearce4NM
6828 2018-01-01 01:53:47 A whole lot of unhealthy stuff - oil, crushed cream crackers, some onions and garlic (cooked and cooled), feta and evaporated milk. Key is 4-5 generous tbsp of chilli paste. I used dried ancho, chipotle and Padilla to make a batch this year.

6840 2018-01-01 01:52:22 He’s been awful since he came back, Nurse hasn’t been good for the last 10 games. Klefbom is playing injured and had been our best Dman by far this year
6841 2018-01-01 01:52:17 @realDonaldTrump So moron what do you say about Russian ships exchanging goods and most likely oil with N.Korea? No comment?
#manypeoplearesaying
6842 2018-01-01 01:52:01 A visit anytime would be great.

As to changing the minds of most people out there, better chance of changin the wind.
The consumer ultimately dictates any market, we wrongly assume that it is us.
Consumers of oil are the refiners & petrochem companies.
We consume their products.
6843 2018-01-01 01:51:44 I'd agree if I didn't know how great Chavis was at LSU. If Arkansas gets the LSU John Chavis, they're cooking with good oil.
6844 2018-01-01 01:51:34 Awoor!!!! I know no one is physically forced but the way they are asked to give is what I have problem with. How many people will be like you to say I don’t have and so won’t give? When you ask people to pay for miracle, anointing oil, sowing seeds, others what does it mean?.
6845 2018-01-01 01:51:31 I have always attributed all that you have mentioned to the term "kleptocracy". One need look no further than, say, Cambodia, where poor farmers are massacred for their land to grow palm oil; as just one example from far too many.
6846 2018-01-01 01:51:26 Stauffer just did on the radio.
6847 2018-01-01 01:51:24 that’s fair lmao that jason and the argan oil tho should be perfect. i’d also recommend checking out the R&B hair moisturizer from lush as well!
6848 2018-01-01 01:51:20 They're trying 
The GOP has prevented that time and time again and is now removing as many sanctions as they can on pollution 
The only reason it's on just co2 is because they compromised to get GOP votes 
And the oil companies lobby both Parties as well not just the GOP

6851 2018-01-01 01:50:40 So are we the slightest bit upset with Russia violating U.N. sanctions and providing oil to NK?   Vlad the Meddler again.
6852 2018-01-01 01:50:14 Maybe US would but i'm not sure China would....they have been sneaking oil in, I saw that on the news.
6853 2018-01-01 01:50:06 And thus call it over analysis. I find it pretty neat to find info I don’t understand, so that I can grow my knowledge to help more golfers, not to limit their growth with snake oil
6854 2018-01-01 01:49:43 They just repeat what they read on anti Islamophobic memes or what from @TarekFatah , notorious hate columnist, without a clue.
6855 2018-01-01 01:49:38 My first attempt... used both stalks and leaves of cilantro, threw it in the processor w olive oil, walnuts, one clove of garlic and parmesan chunks. Salt to taste. It was great (especially since basil is hard to get now).
6856 2018-01-01 01:49:35 He is deep at times. I remember doing algebra in high school and skipping steps. Teachers said “ I need to see your work”. Ron is just thinking and not showing his work. On another note, I’m at Rogers place watching the Jets beat up on the Oil.
6857 2018-01-01 01:49:08 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。

6864 2018-01-01 01:47:49 Sure, fair points, especially today. I don’t feel a trade is the answer though. I feel he could be coached. Also, what would the Oilers get back? Other GMs know they can get value from the Oil for less.
6865 2018-01-01 01:47:39 no it’s a lush shampoo called jason and the argan oil! it’s a shampoo bar and it’s super hydrating without weighing hair down!
6866 2018-01-01 01:47:18 Next week I'm getting some oil to try for night pain - don't like the feel in my head if I smoke it.

6879 2018-01-01 01:45:06 I guess I'm confused on something. My boss (a native-born Iranian) told me all about the last Shah. I was under the impression that he didn't wanna play ball with western powers on oil, so they got rid of him. I thought the new regime was the puppet.
6880 2018-01-01 01:44:51 It is increased oil production that will make us energy dominant and independent. You cannot make plastic out of wind or sunlight. (Your keyboard came from petroleum, and lithium for electric car batteries comes from Chile and Argentina.)
6881 2018-01-01 01:44:36 you don’t know true pain until you get Peppermit Essential Oil in your eye 
6882 2018-01-01 01:44:30 In saying that. If oil can cash in on there grade A chances early in first then maybe the game is different
6883 2018-01-01 01:43:56 None to be found. They're using it as lamp oil.
6884 2018-01-01 01:43:56 Hopefully, we see Brossoit in the 3rd b/c there is no reason for Talbot to continue to sit through this for another 20 minutes...none.

6893 2018-01-01 01:43:09 Also, is anyone going to call out the play of Larsson or does it just continue to go unnoticed?
6894 2018-01-01 01:43:04 On the bright side, Oil won’t look this bad again till next year......
6895 2018-01-01 01:42:29 Credit to Winnipeg team for sure, but Oilers are not even a remote semblance of themselves last spring.  Did they forget how to play hockey?  Or do they just not care?  They look indifferent.

All this madness wouldn't be possible without:

@realDonaldTrump
6897 2018-01-01 01:42:09 Toss in a bit of salt to bring out the flavor, and some olive oil, and then just keep them moving in the pan so they don't burn.
6898 2018-01-01 01:41:42 Look at that lineup...they are stacked
6899 2018-01-01 01:41:31 Huge corporate reasons as well. So many industries could suffer lose if we allowed legal marijuana. Pharma, Oil, Cotton, lumber...
6900 2018-01-01 01:41:29 I don’t think so. China and Russia are not going to let it happen. They’ll do whatever it takes to prevent NK from striking first. Like sneak them oil or whatever they need. And trump won’t strike first. He’ll somehow take credit for settling the issue.
6901 2018-01-01 01:41:22 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
6902 2018-01-01 01:41:03 and the clinic continues...4-0 Jets...tough night for 83 but that one was everyone but the guy in goal...Talbot has had zero assistance this evening #Oilers
6903 2018-01-01 01:40:32 Imagine the ritual, illuminated by oil lamps, her writhing and imitating the snakes  she holds. It would have have spell binding.
6904 2018-01-01 01:40:24 (*｀ω´*)ﾄﾞﾔｱｱ
6905 2018-01-01 01:40:19 Missing their #1C and 2 top 4 D and still embarrassing the Oilers.
6906 2018-01-01 01:40:12 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
6907 2018-01-01 01:40:10 Happy new year ค๊า เงินทองไหลมาเทมานะทุกคน 
6908 2018-01-01 01:40:01 What’s the best coconut oil to use ?
6909 2018-01-01 01:39:59 Soon ISIS will come to your country maybe they are there already supported by Araps & After them USA cowboys will come to save you & bring democracy & divide the country into 3 , Azeri,Kurds and İranians and they call western monopoly to operate your oil and gas ! Don't worry 
6910 2018-01-01 01:39:47 i'm laughin at all you hoes who teased me about my thick eyebrows. haha y'all gotta use castor oil cause u overplucked, get ya money up, karma's a b****.
6911 2018-01-01 01:39:42 Also for cooking,  try grapeseed and olive oil.  Those are oils that the body will not reject.
6912 2018-01-01 01:39:41 jason and the argan oil from lush!
6913 2018-01-01 01:39:22 Mix 4 cups of flour and the dry ingredients. Add the oil and water, it will be a shaggy sloppy mess.
6914 2018-01-01 01:39:08 Watching the @EdmontonOilers and I can’t understand how with all that talent they play like they do. Maybe Mark Messier as coach would hold these guys accountable. Sad in Oil Town
6915 2018-01-01 01:39:06 Happy New Year to you sir. Be safe tonight and bring 2018 in safely and hope you have great things come your way in 2018
6916 2018-01-01 01:38:35 5 cups of flour, 2 tablespoons of yeast, same of sugar, teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup oil, 2 cups of warm H2O

6920 2018-01-01 01:38:14 preaching to the choir...the chance exists b/c of No. 97 but...
6921 2018-01-01 01:38:05 Tonight is Rogers Place cold the Oil is frozen? Because the Jets keep flying.
6922 2018-01-01 01:37:54 Easily most disappointing story of the season so far has been the Oil's first half of the year
6923 2018-01-01 01:37:32 เอาจริงๆ ดิทแพทประกาศคู่นี้แบบเราไม่รู้สึกตื่นเต้นอ่ะ เพราะที่ผ่านมาแบบก็พอรู้ๆกันอยุ่แล้วป่ะวะ สำหรับคู่นี้อ่ะ

またお会いしたときはよろしくお願いします
6926 2018-01-01 01:36:50 When the team is god awful it doesn't help...nor does playing for an underwhelming Panthers side for all those years. He looks reborn and who could blame him...it's fun playing games that actually matter ;)
6927 2018-01-01 01:36:46 Potent oil 
6928 2018-01-01 01:36:27 Found a duo chrome pink & green polish that looks like an oil slick
6929 2018-01-01 01:36:19 Jd just chased a tequila shot with doTERRA lime oil because we didn't have any real limes haha
6930 2018-01-01 01:36:04 Kirain dah balik ke jakartah ahahaha. Nyimak deket deh sepak terjang PHM, mana tau ntar nyasar oil&gas
6931 2018-01-01 01:35:57 Climbing is delusional. The last game against Winnipeg killed that chance
6932 2018-01-01 01:35:36 よろしく！！！
6933 2018-01-01 01:35:29 The last time Iran fell apart, we had the oil shock of 79 and then Think Big #rpt
6934 2018-01-01 01:35:24 He also can't remember last year where the oil companies, in anticipation of a rush of panicking conservatives, jacked the price up only to drop it once the tax was in place... Wonder if that happened again this year...
6935 2018-01-01 01:35:21 Hit the with the olive oil
6936 2018-01-01 01:35:02 2) This dynamic could change as Solar roofs & house batteries start powering our houses & charging our cars. Individualist suburbanites will want PVs/EVs they own/control; household solar panel mfrs will replace oil co's. Tesla is Repub future, they don't know it yet.
6937 2018-01-01 01:34:51 Not true but almost every team is decent and that makes the necessary climb all the more daunting #Oilers
6938 2018-01-01 01:34:51 I'm still amazed at Kulikov. Sabres fans are wondering where was this man last year. Not the same person at all
6939 2018-01-01 01:34:51 This is so funny, I just started using Rosemary essential oil in my hair the last week, I didn't realize it had these properties.
6940 2018-01-01 01:34:39 Galileo=climate science
Pope= Economic interest of the established industries that profit from avoiding responsibility
Mystics- Lobbyists whop promote oil interests
6941 2018-01-01 01:34:38 Diamonds from Ivanka’s jewelry business were used to hide an Emirati oil company’s assets.  The bank subpoenad Ivanka's jewelry line, its diamonds were used in a massive scheme to hide $100 million owed to the bank, according to U.S. District Court for the So District of NY
6942 2018-01-01 01:34:36 vape oil. Please I must see
6943 2018-01-01 01:34:35 Its tough not being relevant in Europe. Enjoy the billions of oil money needed to beat the rest of the baguette teams.
6944 2018-01-01 01:34:17 LMAO! Now if I got a lil oil in me I’ll be a peasant for about 15 minutes  other than that, nah!
6945 2018-01-01 01:33:51 Does anyone know if Trump benefited directly from the Rosneft oil deal?
6946 2018-01-01 01:33:41 @StephMillerShow hi Steph. What’s the brand of CDB oil that’s been so helpful to Max?
Asking for a best friend.
6947 2018-01-01 01:33:38 But all those games against the Western Conference 
6948 2018-01-01 01:33:35 You didn't mention that the oil was being shipped by the Koch brothers.
6949 2018-01-01 01:33:24 Ben Bernanke also said if there was one factor that determined the health of the US economy, it was the price of oil. Obama's shale oil boom ushered in an era of low oil prices, paving the way for recovery. Oil price has increased by 41% since Trump was elected.
6950 2018-01-01 01:33:09 Engine and gun exhaust, oil dribbles. Lot is little areas to do.
6951 2018-01-01 01:32:58 Every team is good when they play against Oilers
6952 2018-01-01 01:32:57 I just spray painted your name and phone number and address on the oil well up the road hope you don't mind @MatthewTreep happy new yearr!
6953 2018-01-01 01:32:39 I will send you a copy of the book once it's available, I cover all of this and more. It's Fascinating what Big Chemical & Big Oil will do to us In The Name Of Profits. Only This Time They Have A Sitting President To back them.
6954 2018-01-01 01:32:37 Wondering if he bought the bish some Jamaican black castor oil for them struggle dreads  
6955 2018-01-01 01:32:08 From a diplomatic standpoint in the region, I'm pro-Sunni (and hence, Saudi). But the regime stands for things that Americans cannot stand (women's rights, gay rights, etc.) which is why our funding of them through oil is 
6956 2018-01-01 01:32:07 @PBandJaeJae don't forget the vegetable oil. XD
6957 2018-01-01 01:32:06 Alright, here we go. Goals for 2018:

1) Finish/release #OwlWomanOracle

2) Stay engaged - keep calling reps regularly, etc.

3) Do at least one more oil painting

4) Start a new long-term gamedev project once OWO is done

5) Experiment with Live2D for use in new project
6958 2018-01-01 01:31:42 อห ดิสแพทเปิดปีใหม่มาก็จีดีเลย ;-;
6959 2018-01-01 01:31:39 I'm guessing he's one of those true experts who thinks that it's all fine and global warming was dreamed up to keep the masses from using all the oil they want.

6961 2018-01-01 01:31:04 I read that as Oil Lol

6963 2018-01-01 01:30:58 And they’re playing short handed....
6964 2018-01-01 01:30:54 あけましておめでとうございます！今年もどこかでお会いしたらよろしくお願いしますー。良い謎ライフを！
6965 2018-01-01 01:30:51 Why is she using the word 'transport' like she's talking about moving crude oil?
6966 2018-01-01 01:30:36 any chance the Oil can do everyone a favour and not come out for the third -  look like they're already gone...to the party
6967 2018-01-01 01:30:21 I've noticed a very steep rise in petrol prices recently. Obviously another scam by the big oil cartel and government. 
Drop these false prices before we get really pissed off with your greed!
6968 2018-01-01 01:30:14 Again...give the Winnipeg Jets credit people...this is a damn good team...Kulikov looks nothing like the guy he had become in Florida or Buffalo.
6969 2018-01-01 01:30:11 やっぱ日本酒とカズノコは最高やな
6970 2018-01-01 01:30:10 The tide is turning. End of Islam in Iran, start of the next ice age, America is great again, conservatives in Alberta, oil above $60/bbl, pipelines getting built. All that’s missing is a proper Pink Floyd reunion and I’ll be happy again.
6971 2018-01-01 01:29:51 ..... it is painfully obvious.
6972 2018-01-01 01:29:40 Floating nuclear power stations are planned to be used mainly in the Russian Arctic. Five of these will be used by Gazprom for offshore oil and gas field development and for operations on the Kola and Yamal peninsulas.
6973 2018-01-01 01:29:34 Happy New Year Jordan! Looking forward to what 2018 holds for you! On another note.. How do I order a tshirt?
6974 2018-01-01 01:28:59 You know I support Oil but Jets first tonight Jay! No excuse at all for Oil to be this bad tonight. They are supposed to party after the game tonight not last night. Maybe some guys mentally checked out already.
6975 2018-01-01 01:28:52 Less oil in your hands in the next season please.
6976 2018-01-01 01:28:39 Da Pikes are awesome. The Oil is horrible.
6977 2018-01-01 01:28:13 And Republicans are so clouded right now by oil money and political donors, they’re screwing the rest of us. Thanks, but I’ll stick with the Dems.
6978 2018-01-01 01:27:43 2018 is going to be an amazing fucking year for me, just you wait 
6979 2018-01-01 01:27:39 Get used to it, pad your stats night in Oil town,,,,,, again
6980 2018-01-01 01:27:37 This tweet reminded me to rub olive oil on a sweet potato and put it in the microwave, LOL
6981 2018-01-01 01:27:33 I don't see stronger. You have weakened our country by cutting so many needed programs, backed out of Paris Accord and decided to put oil, coal, and fossil fuels on top. Not only are you going to destroy America, but you will ultimately destroy the world. #TheResistance
6982 2018-01-01 01:27:27 I always wonder how these huge cargo ships. They carry oil and also who knows what type chemicals. How do they navigate severe pop up storms more likely with global warming.and how about rogue waves. Read The Wave by #susancasey
6983 2018-01-01 01:27:10 ..under the guise of spreading religion, they have spread some oil, Gold and heavy metal profits into their accounts
6984 2018-01-01 01:27:08  been using oil ever since I was a teen lmao not new
6985 2018-01-01 01:27:02 Friendship and money: oil and water.
6986 2018-01-01 01:26:33 Soon Isıs will come to your Country supported by KSA and BAE ,  after Them USA wll came to save you from ISIS and divide the Country into 3,  Azeri, Kurds and Iranians
And Western monopoly will operate your oil and natural gas like in Syria and Iraq
6987 2018-01-01 01:26:24 I was going to suggest peppermint oil on the forehead but then remembered pregnant women can’t use peppermint oil, so in case someone else suggests it don’t use it!
6988 2018-01-01 01:26:04 大嫌いな組み合わせです！！(大声)
6989 2018-01-01 01:25:57 It's only to comfort Daniel, of course.

"T-They do ? Well. . A-Aruska let's me r-rub one b-baby oil to k-keep my hands s-soft. ."

He giggled, his hands now sliding down to his muscular arms.

OOF.

"I-I was hoping that t-they would b-he relaxing. ."

6992 2018-01-01 01:25:23 May we be found watching with oil in our lamps!
6993 2018-01-01 01:25:21 JMV as you have said all along the Colts are not transparent enough!
It’s a clown show and they had better get this hire right or there will be a lot of empty seats at Lucas Oil!
6994 2018-01-01 01:25:17 Atleast the oil pp should create momentum, its not doing that. Whoever is running the powerplay should be fired.
6995 2018-01-01 01:25:09 The greater the fight on your life, the more intense the oil on your destiny.they have no idea.

7001 2018-01-01 01:24:38 Too bad we subjected them to 25 yrs of a brutal dictatorship under the Shah at the behest of BIG,OIL. It'd be great if you addressed the OUT OF CONTROL Military Industrial Complex and joined forces with John Perkins and denounce regime change through economic terrorism
7002 2018-01-01 01:24:33 Can we agree the Jets are a well-coached team
7003 2018-01-01 01:24:19 @BBCNews Iran...do you not know that sanctions are introduced by the USA to bring down governments? Like Iran and Venezuela?  That's why Japan attacked Pearl Harbour in 1941 that brought on WW2  no oil..Are you all thick at the BBC? N. Korea is next, WW3?

7007 2018-01-01 01:23:39 1) Trains link high pop density areas, i,e. Dem cities. Roads link low density, i.e. suburban, Repub areas. Lo density means cars & oil/gasoline sales (until electric cars take over). Oil owns Repubs now (whether Houston or Moscow, both are oil HQs).
7008 2018-01-01 01:23:37 Not that I need a recipe.  I put in whatever I want.  I.e. whatever I have.  Like, I don't have seasoned salt.  I do have corn oil, so I put in a gallon.  That's my secret ingredient.
7009 2018-01-01 01:23:35 @BBCofNJ THE OIL OF GOD
We are looking forward to 2018 not looking back..bringing in new..out with the old!
7010 2018-01-01 01:23:14 In 2018 I really hope Popeye find himself someone who love him whether he eatin clean or not— Olive Oil ain't in it like he is. I can tell.
7011 2018-01-01 01:22:50 Get it popping like ollies, mollies, oil and fire flames.
7012 2018-01-01 01:22:50 I'm curly girl method for 6 years now. Will never go back. I use deva curl no-poo and conditioner and a mix of olive oil, avocado oil, and organic vegetable glycerin as "hair gel." I love meeting other curly girls!!!

7016 2018-01-01 01:22:07 I'm old enough to remember when Eisenhower's CIA overthrew a democratically elected Iranian government to prevent nationalization of the oil industry there...#Mossadegh
7017 2018-01-01 01:21:53 If the Oil could win a puck battle they might be in this game. It's been a joke thus far. #Oilers #GoingHome
7018 2018-01-01 01:21:26 You should just concentrate on your own affairs and stop sticking your nose into everyone else's life's... is there much oil in Iran?
7019 2018-01-01 01:21:20 you are funny...
7020 2018-01-01 01:21:17 Is tea trea oil good for hyperpigmentation?
7021 2018-01-01 01:21:00 Media more or less ignored the Russians supplying them oil, what else was transferred by those ships? ICBM parts and enriched uranium?

7025 2018-01-01 01:20:25 Just eaten Spaghetti Aglio e Olio for my first meal of 2018... or spaghetti in garlic oil if we’re not feeling fancy. It eats, does it not?
7026 2018-01-01 01:20:15 A bunch of Shysters!   These republicans would be the people back in the 1800’s riding around in their wagons trying to sell snake oil to innocent people.  I wish one of their off spring would go against them when they got older.  But it’s hard to turn down $

7031 2018-01-01 01:19:24 It would’ve been a lot harder if we were in a different situation. Evan makes really good money working at the oil refinery and our rent was only 500 a month so if he wasn’t putting like 400-500 in savings a week I was up his butt

7036 2018-01-01 01:18:13 DEAR IRANIAN MULLAHS...Please give TRUMP the excuse to an OIL embargo and sieze all Iranian assets by attacking the protesters #iranprotests
7037 2018-01-01 01:18:07 I hope you feel better! Not sure what your circumstances are, but I just recently stopped my medication and have switched to CBD oil, and it has been the greatest thing for me!

7039 2018-01-01 01:17:55 My biggest long trade by far right now (miners), with a smidge of long VIX and long oil (producer). Not so much conviction as mean-reversal play. No guarantees but odds seem favourable.
7040 2018-01-01 01:17:54 ...forgot the rosemary & olive oil. Rookie mistake. 
7041 2018-01-01 01:17:46 Ima do this hot oil treatment on my hair since i ain’t doing shit tonight
7042 2018-01-01 01:17:42 And some still wondering why oil price collapse for two years. Feliz año y propero energético 2018 Javier.
7043 2018-01-01 01:17:33 Yes! So get like a tablespoon of sea salt (just a normal spoon) and in a small shot glass or bowl, take 1-3 drops of tea tree oil. Mix into a paste and apply it right on the bump overnight for 3-6 days. It’s literally gone + no scar! Hope this helps doll!
7044 2018-01-01 01:16:50 @GM Bob Lutz is n idiot. The belief that tesla is popular because of batteries is telling. Its not the battery, its the craftsmanship, style and class. The attention to detail and even the company leadership.  Last I check GM not killing it. Neither was the price of oil.
7045 2018-01-01 01:16:40 変な夢を見たけどこれは初夢にカウントされないからセーフ。

7048 2018-01-01 01:15:53 Well..., no more oil changes there for me. I will have to go somewhere else from now on.
7049 2018-01-01 01:15:53 Wouldn’t Notley be to blame? She controls the price of oil and the weather.

7051 2018-01-01 01:15:35 Nothing moves inflation more then the price of oil, which is very and predictably will stay low for the foreseeable future.

7065 2018-01-01 01:12:40 +Free food? Cheap oil? That felt like a bad idea considering the economics here. Maybe they had a different sort of bartering system. “This does seem like a fascinating place. It’s a well-oiled machine.”

7069 2018-01-01 01:12:07 
7070 2018-01-01 01:12:06 And Trump is best buddies with Putin while Putin sells oil to North Korea.

7073 2018-01-01 01:11:36 It would be one thing if Jets were making Oilers look bad,....but Oil are just embarrassing themselves. wtf is going on.....
7074 2018-01-01 01:11:17 Exfoliating helps 
Brown sugar and coconut oil 

Maybe try EOS balm but nothing works for me like petroleum jelly
7075 2018-01-01 01:11:07 I'm not a big fan of canola oil, but cannoli wouldn't last long enough around me to be made into oil.
7076 2018-01-01 01:11:06 What should I put in my face oil mix, y’all? I have rosehip, almond, golden jojoba, Vitamin E, apricot, avocado, grape seed, sesame, and flaxseed
7077 2018-01-01 01:11:04 Try to take them of with like olive oil or some kind of oil and it should come off :)

Iran must be harboring some killer energy/oil deal for you and your cronies.

7086 2018-01-01 01:09:21 I'm seeing people blame the  #IranProtests on:
1: Trump trying to distract Americans from Russian influence probe
2: Secret CIA/@TheMossadIL plot to destabilize Iran and install puppet regime for cheap oil

Conspiracy theorists are morons...

7090 2018-01-01 01:07:44 N Korea could not have completed its nuclear force without the help of Russia who supplied oil and probably weaponry parts.  So comforting to know that we have a POTUS that is considered a terrific Russian asset.
7091 2018-01-01 01:07:33 "…deep respect..?" Is that corporatist, covert-ese for "..lust for your oil, other resources & strategic value?"
7092 2018-01-01 01:07:31 His tax bill opens up multiple parts of pristine Alaska to oil firms - he claims he won’t benefit from his own tax cuts (absolute bollocks !!). He has removed protections in Alaska that allows hunters to kill bear cubs & hibernating bears !
He cares for no-one but himself !
7093 2018-01-01 01:07:28 You can even get avocado oil in spray form.  I'm quite pleased with it so far.

7104 2018-01-01 01:06:32 hehe I was trying to, but a Stuka's rear gunner got the better of me and put a few bullets into my Yak-1's oil pan and fuel tank. I soon had to open my canopy and bail out.
7105 2018-01-01 01:06:28 Sir it appears pressititude cabal is burning whole night oil to create an environment of exploited rifts in society ..these are laying foundations of 2019 agenda of caste division
7106 2018-01-01 01:06:24 Another Trump lie -- RUSSIA has been transferring oil to North Korea.
But Trump can't say anything about Russia, cause he owes Putin big time. Bigly!
7107 2018-01-01 01:05:54 It was the 70s.   Does Netflix have "Caligula" ?  After Watergate, Vietnam, the assassinations, the sexual revolution, the multiple oil crises...ah what a time to be alive.  
It's why we got Ronald Reagan.
7108 2018-01-01 01:05:49 Yeah, my plan is to sand lightly and then oil the wood. See if it comes up ok.
7109 2018-01-01 01:05:03 Just shampooed and conditioned my beard, time to hit it with the coconut oil 
7110 2018-01-01 01:04:51 He is just saying that because he wants his oil !! Fk him

7120 2018-01-01 01:03:14 "I dont trust science because I dont trust the government" Is the mistake you are making. Remember when Bush invaded iraq to go after an afghan with Saudi money? Same diversion tactic. You need to ask who is lying to you (hint:big oil)

7161 2018-01-01 00:57:44 The crew of a Hong Kong-registered ship have been detained for questioning in South Korea since their tanker was impounded in November for transferring oil to a North Korean vessel and breaching UN sanctions.
7162 2018-01-01 00:57:22 They are supplying N Korea with oil. He says nothing. The demanded he not bomb Syria again after that dumb ass airport bombing. He does nothing. Congress demand sanctions against them. He does nothing

7185 2018-01-01 00:51:34 Have you forgotten about all US Wars for oil & profit after 9-11 in the Middle East?
Irak, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan... millions dead, DU deaths and ofcoruse stupid US Congress sanctions, killing the poorest children only.
7186 2018-01-01 00:51:28 Burnt taste of the onion straws I lost control of the oil temp (which probably happened when the candy thermometer was using started to melt).  The shrimp were meh.  Remoulade was solid.  The short rib — when I remembered them— had turned into hockey pucks.

When you wanna have some fries, just peel ‘em
Boil them in a pot or maybe steam them
Cover them in oil and then you eat 'em

Despotato
If you’re using Maris Pipers, bravo!
Don’t forget to boil them first, just part bro
Better use some duck fat if you’re smart though
7192 2018-01-01 00:51:01 But there’s all kinds of oil money out there.
7193 2018-01-01 00:50:56 tell me if he uses oil on his head im tryna cop the balding man style
7194 2018-01-01 00:50:51 Goodnight people.

Remember to drive the new year carefully for the first 1000 miles and check the oil and tyres regularly.
7195 2018-01-01 00:50:38 @Percy_Blooms  Is Called Stability in the Region.  That's the reason for Oil Shipments..
7196 2018-01-01 00:50:18 you are subtle as an oil tanker. how could you be so transparently nervous on a public forum?
7197 2018-01-01 00:50:09 omggg what did you use to control the oil? or did you even try controlling it? lol
7198 2018-01-01 00:50:08 まだメンテやってるのか……スタッフ寝てるのかな……(はらはら)
7199 2018-01-01 00:49:50 Yes certainly possible. One way or another oil going up. This bear market has been unprecedented and Lord Elon isn’t getting rid of oil anytime soon.

7207 2018-01-01 00:49:06 By 1984 all the food will run out.
By the year 1990 we will all freeze to death.
There will be no oil by the end of the 1980’s. And all computers will crash in the year 2000

7209 2018-01-01 00:48:24 @BlairWalsh3 I heard McDonald's is hiring. The fries in the basket go in the oil just giving you a pro tip for when you start.
7210 2018-01-01 00:48:23 Come on Oil! We can do this! 40 minutes to score two goals. #LetsGoOilers
7211 2018-01-01 00:48:18 MICEX just off an all time high despite oil where it is. “RSX” isn’t cheap - the Ruble is....a very important distinction IMO. EMLC over EEM in 2018 represents this across EM-stocks aren’t cheap but currencies are! This IS NOT 2000. EM value fairly-ish valued but that’s it.

7217 2018-01-01 00:47:31 Gift strip steak, zip sauce with shrooms and red wine deglaze, smashed potatoes, zucchini slices in olive oil and Tuscan seasoning. Not bad for stuff we found in the fridge. Call me Spenser. Happy new year!

7220 2018-01-01 00:47:05 I heard they got oil from China just the other day.
7221 2018-01-01 00:46:58 I use the olive oil one the most but i also use the argon oil and the Jamaican black caster oil lol i like all of them tbh 
7222 2018-01-01 00:46:55 @SuaveBeauty can you please make my dreams come true and tell me that my holy grail macadamia oil products you make have not been discontinued?? I don’t want to start a new year with crappy hair :/
7223 2018-01-01 00:46:45 almond extract is always the hardest motherfucker to find in stores last minute... so “oil of orange”  sounded pretty dope

7227 2018-01-01 00:46:11 TFW your strategic tactical strike on the grocery store moments before they close on New Year’s Eve is for a tube of lipstick and a gallon of extra virgin olive oil
7228 2018-01-01 00:45:59 Fully agree but first they need to be flushed by another time 30$ oil price to make a double bottom to rally to 100$ and sink the dollar. Record short bets on commercials mean they know something or they will just for fun increase pumping to crash the price and get profits. 
7229 2018-01-01 00:45:55 Even less from the FOX fake news channel about Russian oil going to North Korea. His followers will just continue to drink the KOOL-AID.
7230 2018-01-01 00:45:32 I don't understand why this attitude hasn't gone viral.

I suppose it shows how seriously addicted to Oil the country really is =(

7241 2018-01-01 00:43:07 If double portion and divine inheritance means religious snake oil salespeople don't get to peddle their drivel anymore, then I'm totally into this.
7242 2018-01-01 00:43:01 @OilersNation Irony!!  The 2 Northern Pikes pregame songs, Hopes Go Astray and She Ain't Pretty. Sums up the Oil's performance so far tonight!
7243 2018-01-01 00:42:57 Winnipeg came ready for 2 points, Oil came ready for a 9pm guest list at the Cactus Club.
7244 2018-01-01 00:42:44 So we now know #China and #Russia are selling oil and petro chemicals to #NorthKorea
7245 2018-01-01 00:42:43 I'd go back to Oil City, PA (or was it Titusville?) and shoot Mr. Drake dead if I could.  Or maybe provide birth control for his mother... The industry he started has killed millions already, and now billions are on the chopping block.  Thanks for asking!  I love my Eos!
7246 2018-01-01 00:42:43 I was being nice.  I'd rather trade him.
7247 2018-01-01 00:42:31 If any one has tips on how to get my baby out besides squats lemme know cause I’ve literally tried almost everything I went walking for 3 hours yesterday fucking like a rabbit and castor oil hasn’t done shit help a girl out
7248 2018-01-01 00:42:06 Maybe it's time to start Laurent Brossoit for 5 or 6 games..  At least he overcame the First Shot/First Goal Blues.  #diggingoutearly
7249 2018-01-01 00:42:01 Yeah when people ask “why do they hate us” it’s because of stuff like toppling Iran’s relatively progressive, democratically elected government so the Brits could keep squeezing the country for oil.
7250 2018-01-01 00:41:57 @Chuckjagger824 we r showing our friend Lucha, Johnny and Taya have been deemed Mr. and Mrs. Fuzzy boots and Marty is body oil guy lol
7251 2018-01-01 00:41:43 Alhamdulillah
7252 2018-01-01 00:41:20 I get it but reduced minutes isn't going to fix it.
7253 2018-01-01 00:41:18 this was the first time i put tea tree oil in my bath i was sitting there like “damn.... why my booty getting cold like dat...” 
7254 2018-01-01 00:41:17 I don’t think the fire is getting any less warm. It’s just getting even colder outside. Side note when it’s gonna be negative degrees all week don’t forget to order oil so you HAVE to keep the fire going or the pipes will definitely freeze.

7260 2018-01-01 00:40:09 Say what? A list of stronger sanctions has been sitting on his desk for months. A few weeks ago he called him twice, once to thank him for his approval. He sent a tweet against China for giving oil to NK,  and not a word that Russia is doing the same thing. He's being played.
7261 2018-01-01 00:39:57 we’ll all bring a litre of heating oil for you!
7262 2018-01-01 00:39:32 He is not friend of India, Iran had to align with India because Pak had aligned itself with Saudis, one because of shia-sunni divide, 2nd because of America, 3rd coz India was the only major economy buying oil from Iran.
Ayotallah has openly supported 'Islamic jehad' in Kashmir.
7263 2018-01-01 00:39:30 Mr James Okene you are obviously an oil marketer or an APC sycophant who refuses to face the reality:Buhari has failed Nigerians .I pity you

7268 2018-01-01 00:39:07 I get everyone wants to crap on the Oilers and start with the "their not ready to play" angle but in all honesty, the Jets are just a far better team. You don't have to like it but it doesn't make it any less true.

7281 2018-01-01 00:35:58 Less oil = more expensive energy.  Very strange statement re “energy dominance” given havoc US oil and gas producers have caused in OPEC.

7286 2018-01-01 00:35:27 Did y'all know taking transit, walking, and biking is actually patriotism in action? 

Why? Because it takes oil money away from Russia, Iran and the Saudis like a boss.

7295 2018-01-01 00:34:07 Of all the republicans running in 2016, he was the only non conservative that was not going to do it. His dream is to grow the economy so much that you can have your medical, people can land on the moon, and Putin can be made broke via the falling oil prices.

7297 2018-01-01 00:33:34 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
7298 2018-01-01 00:33:34 Idiots like @Rosie have no clue.  Obama’s admin overreacted and added more regulations than necessary and now they’re being dialed back to where they should have been.  Obama wanted the US to be dependent on foreign oil and would do anything to make that happen.
7299 2018-01-01 00:33:32 For soup, cook crushed onion in oil, then simmer with pork, garlic, chicken broth and sweet potatoes. Top with olive oil.
7300 2018-01-01 00:33:32 You stand in a room with curved walls, which is nearly empty but for an oil lamp sitting on a dinner table.
7301 2018-01-01 00:33:32 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

7306 2018-01-01 00:33:01 @negacoach @closethedoor @gerrimoriarty @Mrfrenzy60 Is it really a good idea to hold back heating oil to N.Korea? If we just gave them some food think that would work?
7307 2018-01-01 00:32:53 well boo. the air fryer is great for frying food without oil. idk how it works, but it's magic. it is not, however, good at making churros, apparently :( so... that delightful dessert snack is scrapped. what will I make instead? :D /o\
7308 2018-01-01 00:32:53 It’s not about 1000 yard receiving seasons, it’s about 3rd downs. Edelman is the oil that keeps drives going. Cooks is a very soft WR,

7316 2018-01-01 00:31:24 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
7317 2018-01-01 00:31:16 Think about why Saudi Arabia would now side with Israel?  Think about the oil reserves that are the lowest point.
7318 2018-01-01 00:31:10 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but enforce our laws.
7319 2018-01-01 00:31:03  We are crazy oil diffusing mad scientists over here!
7320 2018-01-01 00:30:50 I've been saying it all season long...Sekera won't be back up to full speed until next October.

My fam and i gather outside the house after coming back from church and roast yam with red oil...
7323 2018-01-01 00:29:52 Do you think Russia and China were not selling oil to NK all 8 years of Obama, or for that matter, since Bill Clinton announced he solved NK problem in 90's?  I am surprised at the amount of petty, uncorroborated, snarky comments made about President Trump.
7324 2018-01-01 00:29:51 PS: Your Ori oil and my new necklace have my 3rd eye itching... as it did before I was able to read cards
7325 2018-01-01 00:29:46 Why selling oil for their own profit which is also a public property not a crime. Why withhelding people money in banks not a crime.
7326 2018-01-01 00:29:45 SHOtime bout to get that wonder-bread bag treatment hold the olive oil for this shit @MichaelRapaport @JayPharoah #whitefamous #barstool
7327 2018-01-01 00:29:23 In the Patriots offense there is no 1 receiver or runner thats the oil to their engine, its why they are so successful and can win with injuries. They have backups that can play the same role
7328 2018-01-01 00:29:19 My only New Years resolutions this year are to get to work every day on time and keep up with changing my oil. Keeping it simple 
7329 2018-01-01 00:29:02 Oil company executives are contractually obligated to kill any child they meet
7330 2018-01-01 00:29:02 My Granny didn’t use vegetable oil!!
7331 2018-01-01 00:28:40 Putanesca sauce: saute chopped garlic & pepper flakes in olive oil, throw in  can of diced tomatoes, add generous amount of kalamata olives & capers, add 1 can drained anchovies, ssimmer for 1 hour, add chopped italian parsley, pour on penne. Fear gone.
7332 2018-01-01 00:28:35 I think you are absolutely right Jim. Those bastard Liberals are afraid that if Danny comes back with that new oil well on line , he might put a bridge in from PAB. NL. to North Sydney. Look at the saving on Ferries eh buddy. He sum smart.
7333 2018-01-01 00:27:58 Eduardo, yes I have. With 95% export being oil, and the slumping oil prices, there has been increased pressure on the government being led by Maduro. The March 29 decision was very concerning, & then the 3 days reversal; too late. Govt & opposition fight is a mess. Poor citizens!
7334 2018-01-01 00:27:50 Washed my car today and changed the oil myself, today was a good day
7335 2018-01-01 00:27:30 @FordIndia service center people forgot to replace engine oil during service, spoiled new engine now asking me to pay price for it. 2/2

7342 2018-01-01 00:26:01 My New Year’s resolution: go on the Don Corrado Prizzi diet.

A teaspoon of olive oil at breakfast and dinner. Fifteen courses over three hours for lunch, daily.
7343 2018-01-01 00:25:53 About to be on that oil ya hurd
7344 2018-01-01 00:25:00 Yeah I use best shot brand from Amazon. I get her the lemon oatmeal shampoo and the regular intensive conditioner. Those were the only things that stopped her itching. I have to give her the fish oil too.
7345 2018-01-01 00:24:20 Where is project oil money?
7346 2018-01-01 00:24:13 I got you, buy the oil and I'll get it done
7347 2018-01-01 00:23:56 Sounds like Oil haven't bothered to show up again at home.  Surprise surprise..

7350 2018-01-01 00:23:33 Conservatives led us for 40 years to an economy restricted to big oil. We should have been leaders in renewable energy all along, but there's no $$ in that for oil co's. The NDP has finally put us on the right track. Go back? No, thank you. #ableg #CarbonTax
7351 2018-01-01 00:23:16 I just use the capsules you get in the vitamin section, but you can get actual oil to put in their food. Even Walmart has it. I tricked my dog into thinking the capsules are a treat so she just eats them. Lol
7352 2018-01-01 00:23:06 I guess getting rid of those regulations will make companies more competitive and creative... in new ways to spill oil  and screw our planet.
7353 2018-01-01 00:22:41 ....Or maybe pulling out of the climate accord is an act of destabilization aimed at increasing Putin’s (& his oligarch cronies’) massive gas/oil fortunes.

7355 2018-01-01 00:22:32 Vitamin E oil just gives your skin a glow you never even knew you had. I love that shit.
7356 2018-01-01 00:22:21 Which is, might I add, a lot of the reason so many parents have such a negative view of autism. That and the other obvious things like Autism Speaks and their message. It also helps fuel the "cure" snake oil sales pitch.
7357 2018-01-01 00:22:20 I struggle with anxiety and panic attacks a lot. One thing I've tried recently that helps a lot is CBD oil. It is available without any THC so it is legal in most states (including FL), and without THC it wont get you high. For me it works in minutes. Might be worth looking into
7358 2018-01-01 00:22:14 Burned my face frying chicken for New Years Eve. Re-arranged the wings and the oil splattered up on me. Only hurt for a minute and luckily my glasses took the brunt of it. I now know why some folks fry with goggles on.

7364 2018-01-01 00:20:07 You clearly don’t know much about the Patriots offense if you don’t think Edelman is the oil to that engine.
7365 2018-01-01 00:19:37 Less oil so the middle class can spend their tax break on more and higher priced electricity?

[Time skip] 
He had oil soaked on his hands and lab coat. "Okay Yesman" he says and lifts her head up.
7371 2018-01-01 00:19:15 Human claritin and fish oil is fine. Smallest dose. I get the gel capsules of fish oil and pop them over his food. They sell it for cats but it's overpriced, it's the exact same thing as the human pills.

7374 2018-01-01 00:19:00 Also - a body oil.. Squirt it on at the end of your shower and then rinse so you're not too greasy. Neutrogena makes as sesame oil.  i use this stuff my friend gave me that is made by somebody local and it has a rosemary and mint scent and it's lovely.

7377 2018-01-01 00:18:33 Yep, for us, it is hitting something as well. Interesting about this pic, is that there is not any oil residue anywhere on the wheel or tire. Someone had to have washed it off, and didn’t make the connection that there was a problem
7378 2018-01-01 00:18:23 No oil in the water.

7379 2018-01-01 00:18:20 Do eyedrops and if it keeps up go back. I give goose claritin when his allergy's get bad, half a pill a day with food. I also do fish oil and you can do omega 3 treats or drops. Makes their skin and fur really good too.

And why are Russian ships transferring oil to NK ships at sea.
And China ships are doing the same.

7408 2018-01-01 00:14:30 The "West" is addicted to cheap & abundant Russian$, like Hitler was to Soviet oil. It's so obvious: Russia is under sanctions but advertising banners for Gazprom are on Europen football stadiums instead of making things very painful like cutting Russia off SWIFT, Visa and visas.
7409 2018-01-01 00:14:17 Same here, had the oil changed and now it leaks oil.  @MavisTire is the absolute worst.
7410 2018-01-01 00:14:17 Heard their putting an oil rig next door

7420 2018-01-01 00:12:47 @MavisTire is the worst.  Took the car in for an oil change and now it leaks like a stuck pig.  They looked at it twice and said they cannot find a leak yet there is a pool of oil ouside my house.  Stay away from these hacks.
7421 2018-01-01 00:12:35 Bout to make a salad with shrimp, strawberries, blueberries, & some olive oil dressing. Still debating on whether or not to add cheese.
7422 2018-01-01 00:12:19 Or maybe do something to address the problem instead of simply making it worse with your cosy Big Oil decisions. #Hypocrisy #walkthetalk
7423 2018-01-01 00:12:07 Trump has TOLD US, too many times, who he actually is. Listen. He has told us Trump is #1 to Trump. Listen. He has also told us he wants the oil. #Listen

7434 2018-01-01 00:10:36 Both sites look bad I agree, but the San Joaquin valley has so much more area of the scarred land IMO, it's not easy to see why the oil sands gets all the attention. American politicians and celebs need to start looking at themselves first.

7454 2018-01-01 00:06:21 I agree. We need to be supplying ourselves with our own oil.

7471 2018-01-01 00:02:27 Been there. Hope it's better now. Fyi old school method still works. Little warm olive oil or any home use oil, on cotton ball-sized to fit just inside baby's ear helps soothe
7472 2018-01-01 00:02:06 You rock Rob!!  Proud to have you lead our games in Oil Country

7473 2018-01-01 00:01:57 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
7474 2018-01-01 00:01:51 What about our ally Saudi Arabia? They cop people up in the streets for being homosexual, yet capitalism says it’s okay that they remain important and close for oil cooperations to profit from... yup makes a whole lotta sense.
7475 2018-01-01 00:01:34 You think I Googled "oil spills norway" to educate myself?

7484 2018-01-01 00:00:46 Combine 9 tsps hummus with 3 cups barley. Add Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve
7485 2018-01-01 00:00:44 China isn't backing off per se. They are pretending to. Just recently, US satelites caught Chinese ships selling oil to North Korea. I'm happy the UN has imposed sanctions on North Korea though RT
