2 2018-02-14 23:59:36 Tillerson has his own unscrupulous “business” dealings w/Russian oil industry oligarchs going back a long time, which no doubt is why he was chosen specifically for that role. I hope some of those dealings are found to be illegal (eg fraud, conspiracy) and he’s nailed for it.
3 2018-02-14 23:59:07 Then continue to do more and more layers getting light as you go. Don't be afraid to cover the previous. Treat it like an oil painting. Vary the ovals by about 45° but don't go too far. Start with that and see if that might get ya little closer.

8 2018-02-14 23:58:24 Treating this middle class person pretty good right now. More money in my paycheck. Bonus from my company due to tax reform, paid oil bill for the winter, illegal immigrants getting deported and a lot more.
9 2018-02-14 23:58:20 Yeah, I mean it’s easy competing with oil rich teams with all the money in the world 
10 2018-02-14 23:58:12 Unfortunately there's nothing we can do about the system.  It is completely fucked and funded by big oil, big pharm, big guns and other big business shoving cash down the pockets of "elected" representatives.
11 2018-02-14 23:57:36 I need some new oils to get down with for moisturizing. I need a young lady to guide me away from coconut oil and expand my knowledge.

13 2018-02-14 23:57:13 #America in #Syria
Put in perspective!
Syrian troops & their MS-13 rebels take over the richest oil fields in Texas.
Holding the oil fields Syrian jets & their #MS13 Rebels kill hundreds of texans.
Would Syria be in the wrong? 
Why?
We & SDF are doing this exact thing in Syria?
14 2018-02-14 23:57:04 the cartoon villain of this country has been the NRA, as well as the people who take their money, i genuinely wonder what it feels like to have a rotating ball of oil, coins and bullets in your chest instead of a heart

43 2018-02-14 23:55:32 Coconut oil is trash. If ya skin dry see a dermatologist
44 2018-02-14 23:55:32 OK @Hinchtown great interview (as usual) but I am (of course) disappointed that you didn't use the correct term for your new, older fanbase. You know we're FOB's. (And yes, "Liz" certainly fits into that group.)
45 2018-02-14 23:55:24 It was leaking hydraulic oil out of the input retainer and seal inside the hydrostatic transmission. Had to be split in order to get to it.
46 2018-02-14 23:54:43 Hi. Muka i oily. I pakai cleanser senka dah okay dah. Bila start pakai double cleansing guna watery oil senka terus kering menggelupas. Pipi i start naik jerawat takde mata #tanyaTK

On what other issue has the general public cared so much about sovereignty?
gerrymandering, the house of lords, the monarch, oil & tobacco companies paying for decisions.
All massively taking away the sovereignty of the British people but nobody cares
49 2018-02-14 23:54:31 1 or 2 possible updates for usp decor

50 2018-02-14 23:54:06 I tried coconut oil for the 1st time in my life for my severely damaged bleached hair and im freaking shooked!! Why the hell did I spend so much on hair treatment products previously 
51 2018-02-14 23:53:46 That’s ok! Can’t stand to look at him or hear his voice!
His words are empty!
He’s a snake oil salesman who conned his way into office! He’s had a fair chance 1yr 1mo!
He is unfit for office & I will cherish the day he goes down!
I stand by the law! I stand by the FBI!!

53 2018-02-14 23:53:22 Also not cleansing with any soaps or harsh chemicals. I use this oil based cleanser which washes off with water. The body shop camomile face wash butter.
54 2018-02-14 23:53:19 Our government goes on and on about being scared about terrorists getting into the country when our biggest export is terrorism into other countries; especially if they have oil or poppies. Our govt won’t even do anything when our kids are literally killing each other. We failed.
55 2018-02-14 23:53:07 Are you brewing up a new blend of beard oil with scent designed by Arekkz?

58 2018-02-14 23:52:14 So the government gets a windfall if oil prices go up?
59 2018-02-14 23:51:59 Well, it worked because we burned a ton of oil. I'd add that, emissions-wise, pipelines are lower impact than either oil or LNG.
60 2018-02-14 23:51:49 Had an oil massage yesterday, a glorious sensual erotic delight
61 2018-02-14 23:50:49 I think I’m more excited about my mans beard oil than him 
62 2018-02-14 23:50:30 How about stop working for the oil/gas bosses...and try doing SOMETHING for the benefit of the citizens of the state of Oklahoma. Pretty Please #oklegvalentines

64 2018-02-14 23:50:09 Need to learn how to do my own oil change cause this is lame af right now
65 2018-02-14 23:50:08 NRA controls the  government,  oil companies control  the government, pharmaceutical companies  control  the government.  Ceos  and t he 1% control  and trump enables  it .
66 2018-02-14 23:50:04 I went to Bangalore for work and could have bought one insulated and built into a half oil drum for $70, but couldn't bring back on plane 
67 2018-02-14 23:50:02 Retweeted Jeff Merkley (@JeffMerkley):

Follow me to resist Donald Trump putting our coasts at risk of a devastating oil spill.
68 2018-02-14 23:49:58 Oh i thought we were talking body oil! Lol i mostly use neutrogena products
69 2018-02-14 23:49:52 Most basic ass fries. I could throw potatoes in some oil too smh
70 2018-02-14 23:49:52 Inhofe is a Koch Bro, bought off by the oil/gas industry, NRA, Mercers, and fox news to spread propaganda!  R's don't give a crap about America unless it directly profits their bank accts. Resign now science deniers. @SenatorLankford @CBSThisMorning @FOXaandFriends @
71 2018-02-14 23:49:36 ladies don’t wash ur hair everyday, but when you do, run argan oil through the ends, spray it’s a 10 miracle leave in through your hair and let it air dry. 

Thank me lataaaa when ya hair feels great
72 2018-02-14 23:49:29 Oh nah that’s still wicked illegal here lol. I can carry up to 2 and a half oz in a marked container (or oil, edibles etc) but everyone else carrying under a half (I think? Maybe an oz) will only be fined but over that you get arrested.

74 2018-02-14 23:49:05 yknow its pretty nice cattenstein doesnt focus on oil can harry creating the monster instead
that wouldve been too predictable
75 2018-02-14 23:48:53 Then ships it back to the east coast? Add to that Saudis,Venezuela Nigerian oils over 700.000 barrels a day! Irving oil said they will not use Western oil? Of course not they own Tanker Ship!
76 2018-02-14 23:48:45 Check out MyChelle fruit enzyme cleanser, I never had issues with breakouts until now and that cleanser has helped soo much along with MyChelle Cleansing Oil, it cleans and moisturizes my face at the same time 
77 2018-02-14 23:48:42 lol i saw someone tell you to use black soap…..black soap is def not dry skin friendly. Neutrogena water gel is a great everyday moisturizer…you can also use cetaphil and i use sweet almond oil as a night time serum..it’s not greasy & doesn’t clog your pores 
78 2018-02-14 23:48:33 Would serve all oil producing companies and countries to not over produce and focus on meeting demand. The math is simple and something the Saudi’s now appreciate.  Produce 9m bbl/d at $60 or 10m at $50.

84 2018-02-14 23:47:53 @broomfield We (and neighbors) received a letter today offering a lease on our oil and gas rights from Wolf Resources. It says, among other things, that if we do not sign a lease, "you could be subject to a forced-pooling." What does this mean for property owners in Broomfield?

91 2018-02-14 23:45:14 I am assuming from your attitude that you don’t use any petroleum products yourself...or are quite happy to use foreign oil brought to BC by tanker

101 2018-02-14 23:43:37 Oh come on! Dirty Don knows exactly what is going on and so does Robert Mueller! Big oil deal between Russia and Exxon Mobil needs exemption from all sanctions to get that oil flowing! Why do you think Dirty Don is president?
102 2018-02-14 23:43:28 The '06 Oil had F's Horcoff, Stoll, Pisani, Laraque, even Winchester that spent time in AHL. All of them drafted beyond the 1st round & needing time on the vine
103 2018-02-14 23:43:18 CA Leg's response to #OrovilleDam crisis: AB 1270 requiring regular inspections of CA dams. But you don't need legislation for people to change oil in their car. And you don't need legislation for proper maintenance of dams if dams privately owned. #missedchance @J_GallagherAD3
104 2018-02-14 23:43:13 There is no reason to drill offshore, no reason to drill in national parks.  Big gas, oil and coal do not like that their revenue is about to dry up.  They are trying to hold onto their wealth and power.
105 2018-02-14 23:43:12 Have you guys checked out @pretend_radio? He covers people pretending to be someone else (FBI agents, con men, etc. Season 2 kicked off with a snake oil salesman of sorts). 

He hasn’t covered podcasters pretending not to be podcasters though.

115 2018-02-14 23:42:04 You can also use oil and baking powder and water if you need it to rise or for leavening.

124 2018-02-14 23:40:23 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
125 2018-02-14 23:40:18 There goes my crumbs. Big oil is in tRUmps back pocket so how long til we're back to $4.50/gal? Or worse. As oil becomes more scarce prices will skyrocket!
126 2018-02-14 23:40:14 Except that while oil prices were rising, Venezuela's economy was tanking. Socialist economies can't even take advantage of obvious opportunity

135 2018-02-14 23:38:47 Think it goes much deeper than that. Guns functioned as they should. The people didn't.

143 2018-02-14 23:37:15 Coconut oil just sits on top of your skin & be having you greasy as hell….doesn’t soak in at all then you be ashy again in an hour yuck
144 2018-02-14 23:37:01 The fact the “manager” at @TSA took my less than 3oz tub of Raw Shea Butter(in solid form) and left a bottle of 3.5oz of Oil Gel and a 7(SEVEN!!)oz tub of body butter is blowing me. 

Y’all shoulda seen his eyes light up when he saw that shea butter. I know he kept it for himself
145 2018-02-14 23:36:51 Sweet almond oil be having my skin so soft and it’s not greasy like coconut oil!

161 2018-02-14 23:34:07 "Frying in water"...that's just boiling! And it takes away many vitamins. If you wanna cook without oil, steaming is a better option. Although you do need fats
162 2018-02-14 23:34:04 Slice with mooli or radish on the mandolin for a really fresh salad, try and get the radish with fresh green leaves and add them also. Add virgin olive oil, lemon juice,salt and pepper.

169 2018-02-14 23:33:25 Bacon's nutritional value (macros) are good on Keto.  Coconut oil, butter, and lard get boring.  Bacon is a great way to get the high fat needed.  If you eat normal (high carb), yeah, not great.  A high carb, high fat diet is probably the worst combo possible.

199 2018-02-14 23:29:52 Spot on Darryl, it's like how we stayed out of Africa forever until it benefits us.

202 2018-02-14 23:29:29 I agree with all you say. However, it is speeding up. The window is closing for 2 reasons. Brexit: the easy cash/control route to power. Oil: Saudi oil money/influence will reduce within 30ish years because of electric power.   They want world control soon!
203 2018-02-14 23:29:25 By globalists if you mean international corporations and the global richest, then yeah pretty much. The corporatists supporting free trade and sweatshops and wars for oil, etc.

208 2018-02-14 23:28:43 "Too big to fail" = NOT capitalism.

Government coddling certain industries (like prison, pharma, oil, drug testing) = NOT capitalism.

You can call it "late-stage capitalism" all you want. It's socialism for the cronies here in the USA.

219 2018-02-14 23:26:36 Yeah dawg, coconut oil isn’t actually good for your skin. It clogs pores. If you do use any oils I recommend jojoboa. Also washing your face with raw honey is great too.

235 2018-02-14 23:23:28 Here's a woke Matt Tweet.
I've said this before: Build a pipeline from the Mississippi to California.
"Oh, but that would cost too much."
UM. We build oil pipelines left and right...water is a BIT more important. They pay a ridiculous amount for water already! Alright. I'm done.

241 2018-02-14 23:22:57 That UK Gov then posses the audacity to question that millions of ppl even continuing their lives as before is an assault & breaks the agreement UK made. FoM is reciprocal.

250 2018-02-14 23:21:04 Side note: I also make my own garlic oil: throw a bunch of peeled garlic cloves in a food processor and chop until minced. Add enough olive oil to cover all the garlic, stir and transfer to a container. Store in the fridge  I used that for the broccoli

267 2018-02-14 23:19:19 they sell fractionated coconut oil to mix with essential oils so that doesn’t happen! It’s unscented so it doesn’t mess up the smell of the essential oil, I’ve totally done the same thing before

273 2018-02-14 23:18:32 Need for emissions reduction & climate action go beyond provincial or national interest alone. As provincial leader you have a duty to consider wider harmful implications of oil expansion. Jobs are important, yes. At any cost, no. The costs are too great when CC factored in.

310 2018-02-14 23:12:51 There’s plenty of theories going round - banking sector, oil. Never does it seem that the ostensible motive is actually the reason. @CIA

312 2018-02-14 23:12:35 Good. Let them go out of business alongside the oil & coal industries in fullness of time. Companies including suppliers will need to diversify. As well as wheels, tyres, car frames, windows etc they will have2 make EV batteries, solar & home systems, or produce EV chargers.

337 2018-02-14 23:07:19 If guns are banned, people will still get guns and raid rural homes without access to police. Here's a real example, some oil field workers in the Dakotas fear bear attacks so they carry guns in self-defense.

339 2018-02-14 23:06:24 choose your oils wisely.

EVOO is a popular cooking oil for it's health benefits. The oil breaks down under heat, oxidizing the insides of it. Use avocado oil for sautéing seafood or coconut oil for grilling meats instead; boom, health and flavors combine.

you're welcome ; )

398 2018-02-14 22:56:09 Actually, the recession was started by the insistence of the Saudis to take on US Shale oil producers, which forced oil price to very low territory. Insistence of the Buhari administration to keep spending rather than react quickly by sound economic policies led to the recession.

407 2018-02-14 22:54:52 Great insights. More inclined to support Sam's approach, but Thanassis's wise final para reminds me of the old ME quip: Saudi exports oil; Egypt exports jokes; Iraq exports dates and Syria exports trouble.

415 2018-02-14 22:53:07 Yep, as I have been saying to people for ages now (most of them go "yeah yeah, not going to happen, the oil companies will stop it" etc etc), solar is on an exponential curve and the speed of rollout will catch many out.
100% solar/wind by 2030ish!
416 2018-02-14 22:52:36 Yes, I meant gas and opposed to oil & gas here. The reasons why energy or natural resources can be a curse (or not) can vary dramatically and don't just affect underdeveloped states. Take Russia or NL.

436 2018-02-14 22:49:33 I’ve had about 20 IV’S poked into me in last two years. Today was a first, nurse said she hit an artery instead of a vein. Blood pumped out like she had hit oil. #Bloodyvalentine

439 2018-02-14 22:49:08 agreed, but I would level that against the idea that (a) it hasn't risen in 20 years as it was supposed to, and (b) oil prices are still almost half of what they were at their pre-crash height and basically the exact middle of its prices over the last 50 years

443 2018-02-14 22:48:45 Why the fuck is oil up today!? Fuck!
444 2018-02-14 22:48:35 We need balance & moderation. Mining oil sands out of the ground faster & faster is hardly “moderation”  & “balance”.Conservation is another term. Renewables bring us balance. “Banning” is not the solution either. We need quality oil based products. Burning & wasting- not!

447 2018-02-14 22:47:37 Wax and oil aren’t bery orotective finishes in the first place. They are susceptible to all kinds of damage simply b/c there isn’t a thick protective layer on the surface.

462 2018-02-14 22:45:43 POTUS, there is an independent country called Royal Maya, on islands north of Cuba that will become the Shanghai of Cuba, since Castro set this country up to evade sanctions, and they are negotiating oil and trade rights. Tillerson needs to get down there and get the US in on it.

464 2018-02-14 22:45:31 I would love to give Trump (and me) some shrooms and some good cannibus oil, then sit and listen to him tell stories. That would be surreal to hear.  That said, he is a terrible president and person. But oh to hear those stories.
465 2018-02-14 22:45:19 Nuh fam we good with Obama hey! The puppet sold his people (black people) to the dogs by killing  Gaddafi, invading Libya, & causing a civil war. The country is a mess all in the name of oil, under his leadership. And all he could say was "sorry".
466 2018-02-14 22:45:08 There is no rush as there are lawsuits still pending. There is absolutely nothing the legislature can do given that BC's RESOLUTION is about studying oil spill response.

469 2018-02-14 22:44:56 Your old Govt had direct appropriations to contract GNS to try and find petroleum and minerals which you then gave to the oil companies for free. That's was subsidising climate pollution
470 2018-02-14 22:44:39 Yes. Threats need to be taken seriously and by "taken seriously", I mean people need to be put in jail or committed to psychiatric hospitals. It is not normal to threaten your schoolmates or workmates with harm.
471 2018-02-14 22:44:24 A big reason why Putin still has a legitimately massive approval rating in overall Russia, even subtracting all the fudging and opposition suppression, is because The State Is Daddy, it pays your pensions, and if the economy turns bad, it's because Obama crashed the oil price.

In the 41 games he's played, they are 18-20-3, with 105 GF and 129 GA. (0.81GF/GA) (SO/EN included)

Neither of those ratios are good.

523 2018-02-14 22:36:40 Trump thinks we should’ve “taken the oil” during the Iraq occupation. Perhaps he’s now intent upon annexing Alberta and that’s his justification for these deleterious protectionist measures.
524 2018-02-14 22:36:35 I believe it was a case of greed where the Wagner group thought they could easily add another oil facility to their portfolio and any defenders would run from the 600+ attackers.

565 2018-02-14 22:29:44 You've just shown how economical oil & gas actually is; 7.5x more economical!  Did you think about that fact!?

569 2018-02-14 22:29:28 Yet China and Asia are committing to stop building car that use diesel and gasoline in the future, Also, Asia is moving ahead by adopting #GreenEnergy so I doubt #Korea or Asia want tar sands oil. #Alberta needs to diversify their economy. #bcpoli #bcpoli #cdnpoli #ClimateChange
570 2018-02-14 22:29:27 Yes, but United, Liverpool etc spent money that they made as a club, City spent that they made from oil. If they did that these days they'd be breaching financial FairPlay rules, because its known as 'financial doping', aka cheating.
571 2018-02-14 22:29:24 As a City fan most of you cheered on Chelsea and spurs until the oil money arrived 
572 2018-02-14 22:28:59 Technically it’s gas that’s causing the problems in NL, not oil, and for reasons that aren’t relevant to deep-sea drilling. I take the wider point, though, that natural resources don’t guarantee prosperity.
573 2018-02-14 22:28:53 The latter, all for their jewish 'friends' so that they can grab all Syrian oil.  Evidenced by Genie Energy (a US company) is now drilling for oil on Golan Heights NOW. The oil deposit on the Golan Heights, is one of the largest ever found in the ME.

584 2018-02-14 22:26:34 Only in US is it legal to bribe politicians! Justice Democrats are progressives running on private funding. Elect people who WON'T take bribes from NRA, pharmaceutical companies, oil companies.
585 2018-02-14 22:26:29 Dad: when was the last time you checked your oil

613 2018-02-14 22:22:10 For the record Dems are not against infrastructure,  it's how your going to  dole it out. BTW why didn't you move the oil barrel tax you lifted for site clean up to infrastructure? Instead of just abolishing it?
614 2018-02-14 22:22:10 Are you not a lousy opportunist? I made a big mistake for casting my vote in your favor. You and conservatism is like mixing oil and water.

712 2018-02-14 22:10:54 These oil rich teams ain't all that. Bring on Pep and his wallet x

718 2018-02-14 22:10:12 What Makes Oil Prices So High?
719 2018-02-14 22:10:10 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this February? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
720 2018-02-14 22:10:02 Corbyn's public ownership speech: sites only 3 examples to condem Tory mixed model economy as "Capatilism has failed": East Anglia, Carillion, & G4S. Noted renationalised water in Grenoble & mail in Argentina. Expected him to cite Chavez oil grab. Warped view. @Conservatives

722 2018-02-14 22:09:59 Summary of my #ValentinesDay :
• Woke up late;
• Spent the day hating roses, hearts and couples around me;
• Treated myself to a lovely dinner on my own;
• A bottle of oil exploded in my cupboard so I had to clean the whole kitchen and my clothes are drenched in oil...
723 2018-02-14 22:09:58 My Valentine's has gone swell.
1. Started talking to this white boy, even though I know I shouldn't cause well. duh.
2.Slept through a class.
3.Woke up to my brother showing off how his white girlfriend glistens in the sun. but it's just oil and tanning spray so.
724 2018-02-14 22:09:56 EZ shares +0.9%, US shares +1.3% (from initially -0.5% after CPI) as mkt looks through higher Jan inflation. US 10 yr yld +7bp to 2.9% but $US -0.8% which helped oil +2.6% to $60.8. Iron ore +1.1% to $76.7. ASX futures +1%. $A 0.7923 on weaker $US.
725 2018-02-14 22:09:20 I have fine curly hair so a bit different but I’ve done an apple cider vinegar rinse for years and I recommend it, I’m never going to give up shampoo but acv rinse clarifies and spreads out the oil, I use it in addition to shampoo and conditioner
726 2018-02-14 22:09:20 @JustinTrudeau If you side with a Texan oil company over B.C. Indigenous people and environmentalists I'll never vote for you again. Happy Valentines
727 2018-02-14 22:09:08 The nerve of you acting like you do anything - you side with business, mine owners, oil companies, gas companies any time you can. YOU ARE A DISGRACE - and you know what - sit next to me in coach I will tell you about it
728 2018-02-14 22:08:54 Go live in NYC then. They love him. In the meantime, the people that run the Oil and Gas industry need to be voted out . . . But they can’t because they’re in industry and not politics.
729 2018-02-14 22:08:53 Neymar should've humbled himself and stayed with Messi instead of chasing oil money.
730 2018-02-14 22:08:48 Madrid,Madrid.. Fuck oil money. Skill & tactics the way. Neymar,Mbappe?! No meaningful performance
731 2018-02-14 22:08:40 I can't get excited about $QEP a negative income oil company, plus $ENB and $TRP pay nice dividends while I wait to see where oil is really going
732 2018-02-14 22:08:32 Oil free cleanser on a FOREO brush every evening. Lots of hydration for the glow. Twice a week deep exfoliation. Twice weekly masks: one hydrating, one clay mask!
733 2018-02-14 22:08:26 I could lowkey fry plantains with the oil that’s spewing from my face rn 
734 2018-02-14 22:08:24 all strawberries are always dipped in true chocolate with cocoa butter(as you can see  they use partially hydrogenated vegetable oil dips, soon to be banned as unsafe). All strawberries are sent with planned overnight service:fresher that way. We have ingredients listed on site..
735 2018-02-14 22:08:20 Idk if you do oils too but I got rid of one by rubbing tea tree oil on my abdomen (it’s an antibacterial) and taking 2000mg of vitamin C alongside 2 cranberry tablets and drinking a crap ton of water. Gone in 24 hours.
736 2018-02-14 22:08:17 Maybe if he wasn't so toxic with his policies to the environment, then he may have a pleasant flight.  He is in the pockets of fossil fuels/oil companies and completely denies climate change.
737 2018-02-14 22:08:03 These people tire me out. It's so hard to consistently have to fight for Canada's prosperity. I don't understand how they think it's better to get oil from a foreign country.
738 2018-02-14 22:07:59 Even with my dry skin i feel like i have to use a matte primer because makeup makes my skin so oily. If i use a hydrating primer I feel like that’s double the oil.
739 2018-02-14 22:07:51 I was just watching the first episode of Newsroom, and the storyline was the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill.... Haliburton & BP representatives began with that line.  Jeff Daniels scoffed at the ridiculousness of the statement. "Nobody's thoughts and prayers are with the fire".
740 2018-02-14 22:07:38 We just got some new *Purple Hindu Kush 1G Hood Oil*
741 2018-02-14 22:07:33 Can't read, won't read. Ergo fact is lost. The noisiest hinge gets the most oil. If you say it long enough, the people will believe it.
742 2018-02-14 22:07:18 @gadainfo are hugely corrupt, this has led to incompetence, laziness and the deterioration of the force

744 2018-02-14 22:07:17 Ponlo a estudiar, no sabe...
Oil refineries produce value-added petroleum products from crude oil. Profitability is thus determined by several different variables:

Feedstock costs 
Fuel costs and other operational costs
Market prices for the products produced.
745 2018-02-14 22:07:15 I am a robot. I piss oil

748 2018-02-14 22:07:02 It worked for Reagan but Trump will have to come up with a way to drive oil prices down below $15 a barrel. Reagan had high about $40 and deregulated, price dropped to $8 and poof no no pain at the pump.
749 2018-02-14 22:06:50 Too bad the president you support want to open all its lands to oil drilling and strip mining.
750 2018-02-14 22:06:08 I've had this thing for 6 years and all I've ever done was had regular oil changes and I had the piston rings replaced, but those cost $90 and I had a friend replace em for me.
751 2018-02-14 22:06:08 The consequences of action against Climate Change.

- Preservation of the environment.
- A sustainable way of life.
- More local job opportunities.
- No need for overseas oil and gas.

Think Climate Change is a hoax? - then we'll simply have created a better world for no reason!
752 2018-02-14 22:05:51 I just got word that there is a man named Jordan Franks in Oil Trough Arkansas who is starving his dog.  I saw a picture of the dog and he looks like he will die soon.  Can anyone help?
753 2018-02-14 22:05:44 days like this flowers and candy shouldnt even be a thing. you wanna get me something thats gonna make me smile?

756 2018-02-14 22:05:18 It blows my mind how much influence a gun lobby can have. Oil companies, food companies, pharmaceutical companies, hell, even sugar companies, that makes sense. But guns? 

They have to be getting money from more places than just recreational gun owners.

759 2018-02-14 22:04:53 Use Oil Paint... But make sure to prime the canvas and open the windows (the oils smell horrible!)
760 2018-02-14 22:04:27 Refute my specific claims as a person with a real degree does.

Mine is in math. All I need to know about physics is gravity to predict spilled liquids soak in & flow downhill.

A home diesel oil tank spilling onto land is often $100,000 cleanup.  Why is #dilbit better?

773 2018-02-14 22:02:41 You are absolutely correct & they need to outed but, there are a lot more worse offenders than Qantas. Mining & oil companies come to mind.
774 2018-02-14 22:02:22 Remove bc from that and you would be far more correct. Stop funding incredibly wealthy oil companies and fund alternative energy instead, which wont potentially run out or help kill the planet.
775 2018-02-14 22:02:06 Hahahaha @PSG_inside spent All of that al-baghdadi oil money on a 400m euro frontline only to be put to the sword by the dark invader @Cristiano. 
hence once again proving that @PSG_English y’all aint shit

777 2018-02-14 22:01:21 Cannabidiol (CBD) oil is made from strains of cannabis that contain low levels of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is what makes marijuana psychoactive. CBD oil is high in cannabinoids, a group of phytochemicals found in cannabis plants. It is  legal  as it is from hemp plant

797 2018-02-14 21:59:51 No.  The solutions to the problem require oil.  It is a system.  Should we be more prudent with our use of oil?  ABSOLUTELY!  And it is happening, bit by bit.  Too slowly, for sure, but it is happening.  I think you underplay the impact freezing fossil fuel use would have 1/

833 2018-02-14 21:54:48 Clarifying comment on “oil” targets: The bulk of wartime German fuels was synthetic, made from coal or lignite. Significantly, the Reich started a massive expansion of  this (completely uneconomic) industry in 1934.
834 2018-02-14 21:54:41 yes, he's term limited. The polls were waaaay off for the peace accords vote, and I suspect they are again for Petro. The left has traditionally gotten much lower votes. But who knows! Still, the US media so openly freaking out about the impact on oil and business was funny.

If thats true a war is preferable to cooking the biosphere, thus refer conflict risk eg Pentagon.
847 2018-02-14 21:52:21 Was getting oil changed and the TV there had the school shooting on and I just want to cry.  So sick of kids shooting kids and no one does a thing about this #sickofthis
848 2018-02-14 21:52:03 I dont want to live in a world those oil baron cunts win a CL. I refuse to believe

850 2018-02-14 21:51:52 #Trudeau is stacking the deck against the oil and gas industry, making investors nervous. But this has been the @liberal_party's plan all along.
851 2018-02-14 21:51:50 change my oil and stfu
852 2018-02-14 21:51:46 As we come to turn 2 in the Race to 1,000, this is as good a time as any to mention all three cars are running Performance Plus in their engines with crews using @SafetyKleen for oil disposal and the new #Bio24 parts washers aqueous solution...
853 2018-02-14 21:51:41 Just define the law of nature by managing to get oil paint off my pant via vigorous hand washing

855 2018-02-14 21:51:10 Trump must be leaving office then,because the only sanctions that Trump would put on Russia would be stuff like "no selling oil or LNG to Russia" or "nobody is allowed to buy coconuts grown in Russia"
856 2018-02-14 21:50:48 The most incredible (and sad) thing: #Venezuela is the country with the biggest oil reserves, more than any country in the Middle East and they don't have a civil war or a militar invasion. Their only catastrophe is the irresponsible socialist government.
857 2018-02-14 21:50:45 I mixed a couple tablespoons of peanut butter, honey, a dash of sesame oil, and some hot water, and put it in my ramen. Shit’s .
858 2018-02-14 21:50:39 Is that the oil?
859 2018-02-14 21:50:36 put castor oil on my brow because my right brow looks so WEIRD like empty spots that shouldnt be there

862 2018-02-14 21:49:44 JT do you know that EJS left Liberia broke and the population living in abject poverty?? Her Son , Robert Sirleaf bankrupted the oil company and sold all of Liberia offshore blocks. Leaving nothing for Liberia and Liberians. Sad.

864 2018-02-14 21:49:08 And people said PSG were favourites to win the UCL! Bottling Round of 16 matches since oil money started flowing in!

866 2018-02-14 21:48:53 I’m waiting for my car to get it’s oil changed and this dude in the waiting room lays down on the floor starts calling his dog “daddy boy”
867 2018-02-14 21:48:52 Omega-3. You've seen the word (and number) splashed across cereal boxes, tins of tuna and fish oil.
"Omega-3 fats are 'essential'. What that means is that we are unable to synthesise them in our body … so we must obtain them from our diet

869 2018-02-14 21:48:44 “Billion-Dollar Bribery Scandal Sweeps Through Oil Industry” by Sarah Kent and Eric Sylvers. @WSJ reads like the plot of a movie. Great read. One of those “can’t believe it’s true/real type of things.”

879 2018-02-14 21:46:33 There are really good doctors however once you get a bad one it’s like oil in the water, it just won’t go away. However don’t blow them all away. You can tell I’m ancient now with too many years of experience  Our daughter survived however severely handicapped at 34. 1/2
880 2018-02-14 21:46:32 Okumanya PSG was easy
Tujivudde wansi nga oil
881 2018-02-14 21:46:30 I would beg to differ - one time tax on sale or grant to owner for letting a pipeline go through his property is nothing as compared to oil and gas being transported through that pipeline. There is huge difference as tax is one time payment to state.
882 2018-02-14 21:46:27 So much oil money spent on players yet they couldn't beat us in our worst form. Kudos to our players. Hala Madrid y Nada Mas
883 2018-02-14 21:46:15 Except for the EPA that works for the big corporations, the oil and gas industry, not for our grandchildren
884 2018-02-14 21:46:08 Oh, I see. Meatpieces in oil is called Bourguinonne. Meatpieces in broth is called Chinoise. Next time make sure in advance you want Cheesfondue. No wonder u paid that much 
They sold you 2 expensive meals.
885 2018-02-14 21:46:05 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
886 2018-02-14 21:46:01 Maybe  it's  because you re  so unpleasant. Try serving the country  instead of the oil and gas lobby, might get a better reception. You're  treated like an a**hole because  you  are one.#deplorable
887 2018-02-14 21:45:49 So I tried them, and I LOVED them BUT I found it super annoying how I couldn’t put anything with oil on them and I was always way to paranoid I was going to ruin them all the time
888 2018-02-14 21:45:48 How much will a catastrophic oil spill off BCs coast cost? When you account for not just the clean up, but all the losses in economic activity like fishing and tourism? 10B? 100B? 500B? Do we even know? Can kinder even afford a 20B dollar bill?
889 2018-02-14 21:45:34 City the real oil cup
890 2018-02-14 21:45:34 No we can't, we don't manufacture generators too. Having it in abundance is just a way to encourage sabotage. Oil marketers will sabotage, generator sellers will sabotage all efforts at improving power. Mind you China is over 1bn if we have the market they will have the product
891 2018-02-14 21:45:30 Fine and dandy, but where's that clean energy transition? Peak oil crisis.
892 2018-02-14 21:45:09 Absolutely needs both. Oil companies always fall back on "but you're DEMANDING our product" - it's crucial individuals take responsibility for that.
893 2018-02-14 21:45:05 If only oil money could buy you wins. #RealMadridPSG #HalaMadrid

905 2018-02-14 21:43:49 You can buy a team by spending oil money but cannot make one.
906 2018-02-14 21:43:29 Oil money caa win ntn bout ya
907 2018-02-14 21:43:25 And don’t forget that oil news article on OPEC cuts or something... I remember some reporter being so confused about why her article made oil and the markets rip when it really had zero to do with her... or whatever... WTFDIK
908 2018-02-14 21:42:53 Marriage between #Russia and #KSA is of convenience, two of the largest oil producers, Russian gas is very reliant on price of oil and there was a big opening due to the Iran deal and of course #JASTA
909 2018-02-14 21:42:41 We are funded by oil money @ManUtd are funded by glory hunters...fact
910 2018-02-14 21:42:34 Reminds me of the time an oil worker visiting Edmonton left behind his ID after trespassing in my inner city backyard for an assignation with a hooker. I kindly returned it to his company with minimal comment.
911 2018-02-14 21:42:34 To have moved Hall and for the organization to comeout and say the still need a No. 1 D is inexcusable.
912 2018-02-14 21:42:31 I hope we get you in the next round ...  you're not big enough to compete with the European elite clubs, as 2005 2007 2008 and 2009 proves without oil money you'd be you wouldn't even be on Evertons level
913 2018-02-14 21:42:29 Oil and gas above citizens rights!! It's come to this! #BigBusiness
914 2018-02-14 21:42:28 I hate Real Madrid so much but today I enjoyed seeing them beat PSG. Oil money club with no history.
915 2018-02-14 21:42:26 pretty clear that the liquidity generated off the CPI reading, since EVERYone was watching it was used to do this.   I think oil was just kind of a side show today
916 2018-02-14 21:42:22 Dangit, I just realized that’s an oil paint. What is the nearest equivalent or mix in fluid acrylics? I really like that color.
917 2018-02-14 21:42:21 If I were a neutral fan, i'd love to watch a PSG - ManCity UCL final. Oil vs Gas money.
918 2018-02-14 21:42:21 Europe is so far ahead of us in conservation & environmental protection that it is depressing we in America are stuck dependant on oil because it keeps the American dollar relevant in the world
919 2018-02-14 21:41:54 how about a car that can change its own oil
920 2018-02-14 21:41:48 ~ choking on rosemary and olive oil triscuits.
921 2018-02-14 21:41:48 @karenhunter @SylviaKAlston @SXMUrbanView  I remember @Only_Wan_Jacobi discussion regarding CBD oil properties and not THC. #connectthedots

WAIT!!! Cousin said, "Who? What?"
922 2018-02-14 21:41:46 Real Madrid 3 - 1 Oil Money FC #RMAPSG
923 2018-02-14 21:41:46 @karenhunter @SylviaKAlston @Gia_cm @NHolisticDC : very interesting segment.  This oil or cream could help my aching joints in my feet from inflammation!
924 2018-02-14 21:41:42 Him (nervously): "How do we sleep when our beds are burning?"
Me:" OMFG, how many candles?"
Him:"136 babe, and midnight oil...."
Me:" **sigh** just call 911 already"
925 2018-02-14 21:41:27 No one mentioned change of management. The excuse that indigenes are inept is not acceptable to me. Banks are run by Nigerians. Oil companies the same. Okin folded due to bad mgt policies. He could have resorted to family than competence.
926 2018-02-14 21:41:26 He got the “best people” he knows. No one ever said they were going to be ethical, honest and not corrupt. Unfortunately many people will still buy what a snake oil salesman is peddling.

929 2018-02-14 21:41:13 i’ve been here for an hour and they JUST pulled my car into the garage. fuk oil changes and being an adult. thank you goodbye.
930 2018-02-14 21:41:10 The EPA which was started by Nixon, one of the good things he did, is being dismantled by its secretary of destruction appointed by Donald Trump. This is how big oil and gas, the Koch network of “investors“ and the modern robber barons want it.
931 2018-02-14 21:41:07 They aren't even as rich as Real Madrid with their oil money.
932 2018-02-14 21:40:52 I’ll never forget when I had the Jetta nigga who changed my oil acted like I woulda died if I drove outta there without gettin my breaks done. Never got em done after that and was completely fine.
933 2018-02-14 21:40:52 PSG with all that oil money, Neymar and Mbappe, fails to beat the mighty Real Madrid
934 2018-02-14 21:40:49 Yet everytime something mass happens... Oil and water... Sigh
935 2018-02-14 21:40:46 PSG like city oil money can't win the UEFA competitions
936 2018-02-14 21:40:27 Why no oil?
937 2018-02-14 21:40:24 We got too many bombings, suicides, stabbings, kidnappings and whatever else going on in the world, to keep letting mental health off the hook. Feeling safer and helping people do not have to be oil and water
938 2018-02-14 21:40:17 I honestly don't. His target was Larsson and believe he tried getting it done w/ Eberle and was told Hall or no deal. He clearly wanted Lucic either way so it was A or B to get his man.
939 2018-02-14 21:40:16 Unlike the person cutting Social Network cutting the boundaries of national parks allowing people to drill oil offshore where they've already been spills yeah right. He is

942 2018-02-14 21:39:59 Sellout oil money club @PSG_English
943 2018-02-14 21:39:57 I don't think anyone wants Oil Money FC to win the Champions League. I'm happy Madrid won.
944 2018-02-14 21:39:49 END ZONING LAWS??? There's stupidity and then there's YOU! YEP let's end those stupid zoning laws! I've been trying for years to put up nudie bars on school property but the zoning wont let me. A friend has been fighting to have an oil derrick built in his basement - BUT NOPE!
945 2018-02-14 21:39:49 PSG's owner needs to invest more oil money for them to have any chance of winning the Champions League.
946 2018-02-14 21:39:40 Hey @PSG_English! Oil money won't get you a @ChampionsLeague  #RealPSG 
947 2018-02-14 21:39:23 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

956 2018-02-14 21:38:42 Just accidentally drank pure olive oil sitting on my desk that I was going to use to mix ashes with for tonight. Why was the bottle even open to begin with, I have no idea. #MinistryProblems

958 2018-02-14 21:38:26 Ask the doctor about CBD oil...I heard it was good for pain management. I have herniated disks in my lower back and sciatica. A friend of mine recommended I try some of this CBD oil. #karenrebels #cbdoil

963 2018-02-14 21:38:03 Somebody please suggest PSG to put that oil money into some good use and buy de Gea for 500-600 million pounds 
964 2018-02-14 21:38:00 He and his friends in oil and gas raking it in
965 2018-02-14 21:37:48 Complying with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2249 that called for all Member States that have the capacity to do so to take all necessary measures against #ISIS.  The measures #Turkey completely ignored whilst it dealt with ISIS Oil & ran #Yazidi Slave Auctions. OK?
966 2018-02-14 21:37:45 We're 16 leagues ahead of you. Oil money is all you are.
967 2018-02-14 21:37:16 Football is more than just oil money! #PSG #ManCity
968 2018-02-14 21:37:10 The oil money team, over pure class? Yeah right. Delusional City fans.
969 2018-02-14 21:37:05 Al I been reading is how Real is in crisis mode and the team is a disaster...look like a well oil machine to me
970 2018-02-14 21:36:35 There is no real comparable as players on Hall's level aren't moved...unless we are looking about the same GM. Closest one is Duchene & from a value standpoint it's not even close.
971 2018-02-14 21:36:30 Practicalities will quickly take over... when it’s a single “oil rig” type outpost, earth law and Corp rules will dominate. Once there are enough settlers, they will self regulate. No one on mars would expect earth law.
972 2018-02-14 21:36:29 Will that be similar to the oil change video you did on your @MercedesBenz that time?
973 2018-02-14 21:36:24 only virgin you’ll find these days is olive oil 
974 2018-02-14 21:36:11 If we just cool Lucas Oil down enough the water will freeze on the trampoline - just bring coats.  :)

976 2018-02-14 21:35:53 @Hannaford your ice cream does not say 'may contain peanuts' even though it has peanut oil. I almost spent the night in the ER. #anaphylaxis
977 2018-02-14 21:35:43 You want 2 talk about the economy? We will never have a vibrant  economy as long as the oil industry controls the price of gasoline & heating oil. We R getting screwed by them & State Taxes!
978 2018-02-14 21:35:34 Bruh oil money disappointing me wtf is this
979 2018-02-14 21:35:24 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.

983 2018-02-14 21:35:12 Reading your tweets makes my head hurt. There are literally no words to describe how fucking stupid you are. 

Trump and Tillerson sold our country for a Russian oil deal. It's public record. And, apparently, beyond your comprehension.
984 2018-02-14 21:35:12 I don't want to see PSG or Man City win the Champions League! Simply because I don't want oil money to win everything there is in domestic football!
985 2018-02-14 21:34:50 【resource】資源、資金(名詞) This sea is rich in natural resources such as oil. #toeic #英語 #英会話
986 2018-02-14 21:34:37 Unai Emery might just be showed his way with a hair oil kit after this game.
987 2018-02-14 21:34:18 I look at that and think, that’s the smartest team out there.
988 2018-02-14 21:34:11 Chewed on a fish oil pill. Instant regret.
989 2018-02-14 21:34:10 I would argue last year's team would've been better w/ Hall instead of Lucic and a defender other than Larsson. Also, just so we are clear, I was a fan of him in NJ & still am. It's all about value for me.
990 2018-02-14 21:34:03 Glad Madrid the the traditional club has beat PSG a club that is nothing without oil money. Football lives

995 2018-02-14 21:33:42 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
996 2018-02-14 21:33:36 We are the real oil money champions
997 2018-02-14 21:33:25 Ahahaha PSG get gone, never do anything in Europe with oil money 
998 2018-02-14 21:33:24 Tell me how do you feel about Saudis  Wahhabism? Because they are Arabs, but that doesn’t stop USA selling arms and buying oil! Human rights Violations galore for all to see. But that’s different right!
999 2018-02-14 21:33:13 Good. Got no time for any of these oil clubs. 

Mbappe and Neymar done nothing for these tonight, 'future of football' my arse.

1002 2018-02-14 21:33:09 You'll love Pittsburgh.  The weather is notoriously $hi++y at times, but the rest makes up for it.
1003 2018-02-14 21:32:57 There is a contingent of people in this country that actually refer to groups of human people as 'The Poors' or 'The Blacks' like they're 1920s oil tycoon caricatures
1004 2018-02-14 21:32:52 Big clubs stay big forever. Oil money doesn't buy you success @PSG_inside. Sergio Ramos himself is bigger than their whole club. Take a backseat and let the big boys come through!
1005 2018-02-14 21:32:43 Finally got my oil changed, taxes done, cleaned house & I even got Christian something extra for Valentine’s Day  And he’s taking me to Moe’s for dinner bc I’ve been craving that 
1006 2018-02-14 21:32:40 I just can't get behind people saying oil were fleeced based on market. You really think chia didn't try to get a subban or burns instead of 6? I know chia is hated in edmonton but he's not that dumb... and if he is oilers fans like me are in big big trouble
1007 2018-02-14 21:32:37 I need to find some good oil to use on my hair 
1008 2018-02-14 21:32:36 Fuck psg and their shit team made of money and garbage oil .
1009 2018-02-14 21:32:34 I will! And I take Vitamin D. I started taking organic prenatal vitamins and they're helping a lot because they're strong and wild fish oil.
1010 2018-02-14 21:32:25 Yeh pal. Spend another few billion and you probably will buy...I mean...win it. A nothing club with oil money.
1011 2018-02-14 21:32:21 Every time I get my oil changed the workers are so nice
1012 2018-02-14 21:32:20 Real Madrid 3-1 Oil  
1013 2018-02-14 21:32:18 What! go fight for Shell oil? Don't think so, Though wouldn't be a shock if it appears after Brexit, that and forced workgangs working in fields, Would those attending university also be conscripted or  just for less well of kids?

1017 2018-02-14 21:32:00 This guy is an oil slick on top of pond scum.
1018 2018-02-14 21:31:57 So you’re part of the oil lobby?
Oh remind me, what size clown shoes do you wear?
1019 2018-02-14 21:31:51 Oil money failing. Gotta love it
1020 2018-02-14 21:31:41 Wow! I think the "Oil Arab Money" Team @PSG_inside are done on this Game 
1021 2018-02-14 21:31:34 There is babies in survive ? Or crabs ? Or whales ? Or skeletons ? Or invisible monster ? Or black oil ? Or time traveling ?
1022 2018-02-14 21:31:28 PSG falling into the classic sick oil club trying to buy everything trap of having some kind of clown in goal to ruin everything
1023 2018-02-14 21:31:27 Hi @PSG_English Oil money gets you nothing.

1034 2018-02-14 21:30:53 Real has been down this season but their mentality is still elite. Champions League is their stage and there’s nothing oil money can do about that.
1035 2018-02-14 21:30:39 Lol unlucky oil money
1036 2018-02-14 21:30:39 PSG - a group of mercenaries. Go on! Chuck more oil money at it #RMAPSG
1037 2018-02-14 21:30:35 Very sad that big oil and coal have it all. On top that’s clean energy !
1038 2018-02-14 21:30:33 The only “right time” would be if these kids were the children of Big Oil execs, Big Pharma execs, Defense contractors, etc. that must be what it takes. Threaten to cut off the GOP’s funding.
1039 2018-02-14 21:30:33 This is what oil money gets ya? 3-1 Real Madrid #holaoilmoney #ChampionsLeague #realmadrid #PSGvsReal
1040 2018-02-14 21:30:32 And that’s where Arab oil money gets you. Losing 3-1 to the worst Real side I’ve seen in years
1041 2018-02-14 21:30:28 يارب جميعا
1042 2018-02-14 21:30:25 Does that hold true for our oil and gas industry?
1043 2018-02-14 21:30:24 Like baking a cake. Get in there with your fingers and toes. But no oil. You want to keep it healthy.

1046 2018-02-14 21:30:12 Good conversation and points.... winning a trade means making your team better. Oil wouldn't have had last year without 6. Who is more of an impact player? 4! But when it comes to team oil needed d. if you don't think it was fair market value give me another nhl example similar
1047 2018-02-14 21:30:04 Lol.. oil money psg!

1051 2018-02-14 21:29:19 we don’t treat most of ours. its expensive and seen as snake oil in places where god fixes all
1052 2018-02-14 21:29:14 1) cook meat (chicken, pork, fish in oven/ on stove/slow cook?)
2) cook veggies (broccoli or brussel sprouts w/ garlic and olive oil in oven, green beans w/ garlic on stove, salad if lazy)
3) eat w rice
This is how I live.
1053 2018-02-14 21:29:06 I deeply believe in both the healing powers of @lizzo's Coconut Oil EP and the actual substance that is coconut oil.  Happy #ValentinesDay, everyone. 
1054 2018-02-14 21:28:57 I'm astonished that the fans of all the 'non-filthy TV & oil rich clubs' arent bored stiff of football. They'll have to watch the same few clubs take their players, thrash them, & win everything for decades on end

1058 2018-02-14 21:28:36 1 MW is 6 jobs. 8 for solar. So must have been 10,000 MW (10 GW.) Instead we should be supplying our own homes, schools etc at cheaper cost (cost is 5c/KWH from renewables vs 16c/KWH oil/gas/coal.)

thin slice potatoes, season with oil, salt, pepper and whatever else you want. Stack them in rows and line them up in the baking dish. Squeeze a lime over it, drizzle 2 types of BBQ sauces or any sweet sauce, bake alum covered 30 min at 420 degrees, uncover 10 min longer

1081 2018-02-14 21:26:10 Alberta can do whatever the f it wants with its oil as long as it doesn’t affect me. An oil tanker sinking of BCs coast affects me greatly. Here’s an idea, refine it in Alberta
1082 2018-02-14 21:25:56 But the historical assessment is that Harris was probably wrong to devote 40-50% of Bomber Command’s effort against cities, and only 15%-20% against oil, and this mistake prolonged the war.
1083 2018-02-14 21:25:54 skin routine for acne/ oily skin:
1.wet face and wash with coconut oil
2.  wash off with warm wash cloth
3. tone any extra oil/dirt away with alcohol free witch hazel
4. after spritz face with rose water
5. moisturize with 1 drop rosemary seed oil 1 drop tea tree oil
1084 2018-02-14 21:25:51 Trump wants to open the entire east coast shoreline to no limit refining of oil and natural gas which will kill the oceans eco system,  make beaches in Jersey unsafe to swim in which will in turn lead to the drop of many coast line homeowners property values #ProtectTheOcean
1085 2018-02-14 21:25:50 ooo i don’t know how that works. but use tea tree oil for the pimples and use witch hazel as a toner and your skin will clear up. worked for me 
1086 2018-02-14 21:25:34 Say na, not groundnut oil o#BBNaija
1087 2018-02-14 21:25:31 If you have any problems in life just add truffle oil and they will be solved
1088 2018-02-14 21:25:26 @AppleSupport @AppleMusic I’m amazed that you didn’t know silicon can harm some wood surfaces. Guitar stand makers have known this for decades. Oil and nitro based wood finishes are particularly vulnerable. If only you had asked.

1090 2018-02-14 21:25:20 So I was complaining about the new sc update to some guy and he was like “lol I bet you’re the type to ignore your check engine light”. In my head I was like this fucking dick but I replied with “oh who changes your oil” and he said “Walmart”.. I said “do you even know how?” Then
1091 2018-02-14 21:25:13 Oil is cancelled, hun. Find a new natural resource to exploit / kill the earth with. Bye.

1096 2018-02-14 21:24:34 Property tax is not earning - constant elevated rate is - if BC would gone free to have oil - We all know options are wider and precise. And it’s not oil and gas - bc contributes a lot in meat, non alcoholic food and beverages is also which may going to effect in this war !
1097 2018-02-14 21:24:30 Remember when Obama left office and gas was hovering just above $1.50? Local NJ paper said we should see $3.00 a gallon by spring. All while oil companies make record profits... But keep telling us how Trump is saving the little people money... #MAGA
1098 2018-02-14 21:24:30 Forgot to mention how he went about getting those Interviews. Such as How many old man dicks he had to suck or how much baby oil he had to have rub all over himself.

1107 2018-02-14 21:22:27 Is there anyone else that is addicted to #coconutoil as much as I am?  There are so many hair benefits, such as, hair growth, moisturizer, etc. How do you use coconut oil and why? 
1108 2018-02-14 21:22:24 "You are such a delight."  Hela summoned a bottle of oil for him. She removed the robe before lying down on her stomach.
1109 2018-02-14 21:22:24 Have to say tho, the routine battering of once competitive clubs by the filthy TV and oil rich in the Champions League is depressing
1110 2018-02-14 21:21:57 Will we remember 2018 as the year that the West grew a pair and stood up against violent dictatorships, or will Europe and the US sell out their own futures to appease these tyrants?  Arms contracts and oil pipelines aren't a reason to turn a blind eye to authoritarianism.
1111 2018-02-14 21:21:53 You forget he is against a team financed by an oil rich country..... he will get outbribed.

1118 2018-02-14 21:20:54 Agreed.  That is indeed in the works and will eventually evolve into reality.  It is not an Off/On switch, it can’t happen as quickly as most think.  Until then, Oil is still the “Go To” regarding resources and economics.  All in good time!

1120 2018-02-14 21:20:39 I wish I knew.  I think I had the oil too hot. Then one of the yolks broke, and it all just became a disaster.

I still ate them though.

1123 2018-02-14 21:20:29 This is a completely unforced error. If he wants to fly private rather than actually be forced to listen to the tax-payers to which he is beholden…he can have  the Oil/Gas executives he caters to loan one of their private planes. It is disheartening he sees no ethical failing.
1124 2018-02-14 21:20:15 Oil
1125 2018-02-14 21:20:14 OH YES.

1140 2018-02-14 21:17:29 I grew up in the south of France where they make their own olive oil. Never got sick EVER! Look into olive oil producers in Vallauris/Cannes/Nice for your olive leaf oil maybe Roger Stone? @WarRoomShow

1148 2018-02-14 21:15:49 Plus I've learned a lot more about the socialist snake oil he sells since Trump won. Bernie IS NOT there for the People. And his wife is a fraudster.
1149 2018-02-14 21:15:43 Give nothing to the middle east, let them support themselfs off there oil reserves . That's what they really worship.
1150 2018-02-14 21:15:43 Problem is H2 panders to the mindset that big oil has got us used to as consumers since ICE cane along, that you must go to forecourt and buy your fuel in less than 10 mins and go. H2 might have got in there if had preceded batteries but it didn’t. 1/2

1167 2018-02-14 21:12:57 No you did you see back in the sixties Iran had a democratically elected government both America and Britain betrayed democracy itself and installed a dictator called The Shaw so they can get the majority of the oil profits instead of the people of Iran itself
1168 2018-02-14 21:12:48 Is the pipeline not being built? I can’t say it isn’t. The failure to expanded oil shipments doesn’t mean the pipeline can’t be built. Conservative logic strikes again.

1178 2018-02-14 21:10:45 Also make sure it clings to my belly button like I'm covered in oil or something.

Oh and the bottom has to be pleated. Can you have it done tomorrow?
1179 2018-02-14 21:10:23 If another country invaded we must defend ourselves. That's what the Department of DEFENSE is actually supposed to be for. Not for creating wars in other countries so that US corporations can build an oil pipeline.

1182 2018-02-14 21:09:24 Please. Not even close to the extent it does without him in it.
And when he is here, he is our best defensive Dman by a country mile.
So fix the D around him, and try not to "Petry" him right out of town, as Oil fan seems to enjoy doing ever so much with defenders.

1210 2018-02-14 21:05:09 I agree but after all their years of guns everywhere, how would you start to stop it? It's big business in the US, right down to the people who sell and manufacture cases and cleaning oil.  It's terrible and how could you possibly solve the problem overnight.

1230 2018-02-14 21:02:18 Don't waste your money on a multivitamin if you have a good diet.

Instead spend it on Curcumin or Niacin which are also reputedly good for anxiety. 

Also consider a good fish oil with a high amount of DHA; it feeds the brain.

1267 2018-02-14 20:55:55 Monster Hunter Worlds totally has a well-developed multiplayer experience, but it can be done entirely offline and via single player, which really appeals to me, since i occasionally take my PS4 with me to jobs at oil rigs in the middle of nowhere
1268 2018-02-14 20:55:50 Oil execs are on the WH hotline right now. Gone by tmrw
1269 2018-02-14 20:55:36 As far as I'm concerned, the best sports are ranked as follows:

10) Soccer
9) Golf
8) Hockey
7) Tennis
6) Gymnastics
5) Wrestling
4) Figure Skating
3) Rugby
2) Headis
1) Turkish Oil Wrestling
1270 2018-02-14 20:55:34 I feel like from context it’s clear that we mean the emotional intimacy of wrestling is more homoerotic than the muscle guys wearing makeup and baby oil of wrestling. If not, hopefully now it is
1271 2018-02-14 20:55:32 hey you never know, that pr $ machine may start up again, or fuck who knows maybe those prayers helped out and they magically do find oil lol, almost 0 chance tho, short any pop so far

Engineering at university is not what you think! @YoEgovuk
1273 2018-02-14 20:55:04 You dont know the half of them.  I usually bring a turkey baster, clothes line pins, a garden gnome, unicycle and a can of 10W30 motor oil.
1274 2018-02-14 20:54:57 @mklare1 Are you a prepper?  As worried about doom as your articles are I can't imagine why you wouldn't be. Feb 5th tweet "the end of oil is nigh."  Today's article Trumps fossil fuel strategy "dooms us all."  Which is it?
1275 2018-02-14 20:54:49 I know you said Zigbee but Oil and gas would love this!  ISA100 and WHART are prevalent in refineries, pipelines and gas plants.  Not sure what options are out there for 802.15.4 radios.  Currently, links are near impossible to troubleshoot.
1276 2018-02-14 20:54:45 WHY can't the US have to intervene in every matter of Muslim Countries! Be it Iraq,Libya, Kuwait,Yemen, Syria!if they want free crude oil let them have it but why at the cost of human lives!
1277 2018-02-14 20:54:38 Well look at his...picture. Is that the Avatar? I still don't know wth that is. It's a pic of a dude in makeup in wings. If I put up a pic, it's going to be like Jessica Rabbit not Olive Oil.
1278 2018-02-14 20:54:29 Climate Barb I think it's time to take a break I'm surprised it wasn't those nazi rapist oil workers,you're slacking.

1283 2018-02-14 20:53:49 I spilled a tinsy bit of tee tree oil on my pants and now I'm out here smelling like a forest
1284 2018-02-14 20:53:30 That’s not gonna fly with the GOP’s oil company backers.
1285 2018-02-14 20:53:29 Oil's traded in dollars so makes no difference to bp

1287 2018-02-14 20:52:52 DistribtionNOW, like most oil services,  now has to worry about the effect of rising rates on its client base as well as the price of oil. $DNOW
1288 2018-02-14 20:52:50 I burned my hand with avocado oil. 
1289 2018-02-14 20:52:47 my grandmother used to baste us kids in iodine and baby oil.
1290 2018-02-14 20:52:47 Snapped the bonnet lever... and also the oil pressure light is coming on which could be verryyyyyyyy bad news
1291 2018-02-14 20:52:45 i love how coconut oil works on my hairs.
1292 2018-02-14 20:52:07 Don't sauté it, man! Douse w/ olive oil & salt & roast for 10-15 min @ 350F for kale chips you won't want to scrape away. Or dress it w/ olive oil & lemon juice + kosher salt, massage for a couple of minutes, add toasted pine nuts & shreds of parmesan cheese. Yum!
1293 2018-02-14 20:52:01 Use oil on your scalp after shampooing. You should always do this when your hair and scalp is clean.
1294 2018-02-14 20:51:48 نراكم في الموسم القادم
1295 2018-02-14 20:51:39 I thought the same thing. What was the reason for spending that ridiculous amount over there?  Roads to the oil fields?  Stop the corruption Mr. President.
1296 2018-02-14 20:51:37 Been using this Hoe Oil I made nd bags been getting secured  I wanna share this w yall so ima make a HUGE batch tonight, harvest this Vday, New Moon energy. All my sw's/sugababez/gigworkers this is for yall

1298 2018-02-14 20:51:26 Pruitt needs to stop traveling to hang out with Big Oil,Coal and other companies that are paying him to drop all of the regulations that keep Americans safe
1299 2018-02-14 20:51:23 Now that Hillary is going down they need to anoint the next contender.
1300 2018-02-14 20:51:22 My nigga, he got more coco butter and oil’s on him than southern black church ladies
1301 2018-02-14 20:51:16 Loser! @EPAScottPruitt is totally unfit to head the EPA as he is owned by the oil industry..!

1308 2018-02-14 20:51:06 @mmmhotbreakfast my 3 boys 32 29 and 28 love the music i grew up on. Even love the odd Neil Diamond and Fleetwood Mac. Taught them well. 2 of them went to Midnight Oil last year. Hi Dean Shaun and Liam.
1309 2018-02-14 20:51:01 Marcelo don clear neymar doubt
1310 2018-02-14 20:50:58 i just used an oil absorption sheet.... BITCHHHH IM NASTY 
1311 2018-02-14 20:50:52 In the case of the DPRK, are you referring to the general trend or the specific drop in the early 90s? If the latter, I think pointing to their reliance on cheap USSR oil (which only provided 10% total energy but was still v crucial to agriculture) is more significant than US.
1312 2018-02-14 20:50:29 Almost every known substance on earth is a “Pollution” in high lethal concentrations.Pour 1 million barrels of milk into the Local River & it will kill fish for 3 Kms till the PPMs drop. Grade 10 science. Too many people, cars, planes, factories all burning gas, coal & oil!!!!
1313 2018-02-14 20:50:26 Gonna need a comment about this school shooting instead of an oil and coal tweet
1314 2018-02-14 20:50:13 yess!! i love them roasted with proper seasoning too! tons of garlic and herbs and tons of olive oil mmmm
1315 2018-02-14 20:50:08 Why can't his Gas & Oil buds give him rides on their private planes. You know the planes they bought with the money they saved when Pruitt let they resume polluting the planet.
1316 2018-02-14 20:49:47 Cows have Aadhaar.

Indian = Cow

Cows are milked. Indians will be milked. By Bill Gates led Global Elites who want an absolute social control by controlling Big Data. Since Data are the new oil that can't be stolen by waging (civil) war.

1317 2018-02-14 20:49:46 I forgot it was Ash Wednesday today and I had a customer come in with a smudge on his forehead. I almost pointed at his head and said, “hey you got oil on your forehead bud”.
1318 2018-02-14 20:49:41 
1319 2018-02-14 20:49:41 So much harm from oil. Sad.
1320 2018-02-14 20:49:35 Yes, oil was the issue. Biafrans rejected British rule.
1321 2018-02-14 20:49:34 Cashew nuts contain oil in the shell that is very irritating to the skin
1322 2018-02-14 20:49:27 Thankful that we put oil on our faces and not ashes #orthodoxprobs #greekgoddessprobs
1323 2018-02-14 20:49:26 These are manoushe, baked pitas with zaatar and olive oil 

(eaten with the lebneh) 

so a little bit of food!
1324 2018-02-14 20:49:20 My wife's an oil painter—keeps solvent in a snap-top stainless steel container. This container had a rubber gasket.  Vapor would cause it to expand, and make it a very wrong fit after only a day or so.  After two failed, we made a leather one. Solved! Laser-cut saddle leather?
1325 2018-02-14 20:49:00 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
1326 2018-02-14 20:48:53 Yes, that the best way to get the poor to pay trumps share. Did you see what the price of oil did today? Skyrocket. That drives up the cost of gas.

1328 2018-02-14 20:48:05 Maybe she is begging for the butt stuff
1329 2018-02-14 20:47:59 Erm...if that’s the oil rig then yes there is 
1330 2018-02-14 20:47:35 gold on fire oil up also bonds 5 year low
1331 2018-02-14 20:47:26 Adulting is seeing all the fun recommended for you videos on YouTube and searching “how to change your car oil” instead. I’m not loving this...
1332 2018-02-14 20:47:25 can you even oil flatpack laminate wood?
1333 2018-02-14 20:47:24 Coconut oil self massage 
1334 2018-02-14 20:47:16 Could be your bowl. It helps if its a non-reactive material like glass or metal. Plastic baking bowls often have oil residue left on them. Good luck!
1335 2018-02-14 20:46:46 They’ve been supportted by Western and they are controling the most important energy and oil routes. And guess what Turkey is already know this. Again if you’re not an idiot you could see easily. We’ll not give a shoot to PKK 
1336 2018-02-14 20:46:46 Hush now!
1337 2018-02-14 20:46:40 I'll eat pussy upside down, make water for scratch, change her oil and brakes in the snow, and go 10 rounds for an Alfredo Mami... U niggas ungrateful #PickMe
1338 2018-02-14 20:46:37 Yes, why can't these artists rely on sweetheart public land deals like the oil companies and Cliven Bundy?
1339 2018-02-14 20:46:36 Those rich oil barons gotta get that huuuuuuuuge tax refund back quickly.
1340 2018-02-14 20:46:32 This Valentine’s Day, I’ll be meal prepping and doing ~at least~ 5 loads of laundry. All after I got an oil change.  #WhatHoliday

1342 2018-02-14 20:46:18 Another big win for the middle and lower class! Oil companies must be pissed. Truly a man of the people.

1344 2018-02-14 20:46:14 I will always respect RM, because they have an amazing history and are one of the best teams in the world. They deserve that respect they have earned it. PSG just have oil money and think they can go around buying respect and history. Fck off!
1345 2018-02-14 20:45:48 Careful this stuff has lavender oil in it i think, really irritated some acne i had. Made it worse. Aromatherapy lavender oil is a skin irritant
1346 2018-02-14 20:45:42 Loving my @NeomOrganics face oil #nourishsleeprestore treat yourself!
1347 2018-02-14 20:45:24 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1348 2018-02-14 20:45:03 Trucks are useful to basically everyone in the construction and agriculture industries as well as those in the oil industry who have to access well sites found down various back roads in variable weather conditions.
1349 2018-02-14 20:44:44 '92 Skyline dude just came back in. That car takes 7.5W-30 oil. I didn't know that existed. Of course you can make it by adding equal parts 5 and 10W-30 together.
1350 2018-02-14 20:44:31 The national parks are not thoroughfares for oil pipelines. End of discussion. #nps @SecretaryZinke don’t be a fool.
1351 2018-02-14 20:44:29 Getting an oil change spoiling my biatch today 
1352 2018-02-14 20:44:19 I take it you guys haven't heard of leading by example? There's not much we can do about other countries' practices, but we have control over our own.

If we stop sucking from the fossil-fuel teat, we won't need oil--whether our own or imported from other places.
1353 2018-02-14 20:44:17 Oil cleanse with jojoba oil
1354 2018-02-14 20:44:16 I worked for a Norwegian company for a decade. The author fails to mention the oil subsidies that contribute to the Norwegian economy. They have vast North Sea oil reserves.
1355 2018-02-14 20:44:09 This uber smells like palm oil im acc vexed....
1356 2018-02-14 20:44:03 Well make yourself feel better knowing that you’re horribly ill informed. Scotland has deluged the UK Exchequer with vast quantities of oil wealth since the 1970s, contributing far more than we received. The Crone Report might be a good place for you to start.
1357 2018-02-14 20:43:54 Love the smell of bio oil 
1358 2018-02-14 20:43:49 my question is how can the left perpetually label everyone who has made it "stealing it from the poor".  when not all rich correlates to the poor and down trodden.  the examples shown are the accepted ones, ie. oil companies.  but, the left umbrellas everyone under rich.
1359 2018-02-14 20:43:41 This canola oil really stands the heat.
1360 2018-02-14 20:43:34 Gold's up, copper's up, and April crude oil soared $1.67/bbl even though inventories are UP over 184 million barrels.  Huge day trading is taking over rational thinking.  Danger is if there's "no place to run/nowhere to hide."  Gold can't absorb a retreat from bonds or equities.
1361 2018-02-14 20:43:25 Just have Alberta set up a clean up fund to be paid out to BC in case of an oil spill from Kinder Morgan pipeline and oil being shipped out of Vancouver. #ableg #ABPoli
1362 2018-02-14 20:43:20 Each one is special, and probably my first solo designed sweater. I'm on a hat kick right now and it's so fun that I can't knit them fast enough :) Other than making epic olive oil do you guys have any fun hobbies?
1363 2018-02-14 20:43:18 President Trump is taking over the global oil market with AMERICAN oil.

Pres Trump is taking away Putin's oil money which is where he gets his power.

I know u won't believe it but it's checkers vs chess.

You can't see it b/c of your hate.
1364 2018-02-14 20:43:14 I'm not opposed to gas taxes to pay for infrastructure, but I'm opposed to it while reducing alternative energy investment (which drives up the cost of oil) and tax cuts to corporations and billionaires.
1365 2018-02-14 20:43:11 Thoresen was always a sentimental underdog favourite. Also, seems like there are more than a few ex-Oilers out there...I believe Alex Plante & Bryan Allen on South Korea’s D are ex Oil (or Oiler system), non?
1366 2018-02-14 20:43:09 Bought a bunch of spray paint for various projects cluttering up my room AND got my oil changed & now Ive got to choose what to budget for across gas, liquor, & bills. SOB
1367 2018-02-14 20:43:07 The oil's for the car, I assume? 
1368 2018-02-14 20:42:54 water and oil don’t mix
1369 2018-02-14 20:42:47 No be crude oil..... @adekunleGOLD
1370 2018-02-14 20:42:43 fuck useless pipelines build high speed rail so when the oil dries up we can ship something else instead of just have metal pipes crisscrossing our beautiful country
1371 2018-02-14 20:42:41 I'm far away from being a Republican supporter, as much as I disliked G. W. Bush,especially w/lies w/WMD in Iraq he told to get us into an oil war, he wasn't so manifestly unfit in-tellectually, morally, temperamentally for the office of POTUSA as Trump.
1372 2018-02-14 20:42:04 We are witnessing  a steady rise in Oil prices in Ke yet nothing has moved on the international barrel price front.
1373 2018-02-14 20:42:01 Getting an oil change
1374 2018-02-14 20:41:58 You have us hot soapy water to cleen it thin Heat the iron skillet up put little bit vegetable oil
1375 2018-02-14 20:41:58 Lmfaooo the tt oil has a cooling sensation to me but acv is harsh I leave water on my face so it’s not just straiiighhhhtttt on there but yeah if you couldn’t take tt oil acv not for you lol
1376 2018-02-14 20:41:51 a gas tax doesn’t help oil producers does it?
1377 2018-02-14 20:41:47 DJT and his oil buddies....Make me SICK
1378 2018-02-14 20:41:37 Here is some free chicken for anyone looking for trades. Oil should head towards $62 then back test to 50's. Nat Gas should take off. But everything could change.

Remember don't bet on emotions. If the trends break, don't be afraid to go with what you see. #OOTT #natgas
1379 2018-02-14 20:41:37 Lol why don't you keep your dirty oil in your own province?
1380 2018-02-14 20:41:36 Cory got me an oil change for Valentine’s Day 
1381 2018-02-14 20:41:30 Well then you better find 400 M fast! Good luck!! Just give a call to all the oil and gas companies!!!
1382 2018-02-14 20:41:21 Smelling like an oil change
1383 2018-02-14 20:41:16 Bale should come in fr Nacho,his wing is weak...
1384 2018-02-14 20:40:44 I wonder how would iraq look like in 15 years with $60 oil barrel
1385 2018-02-14 20:40:40 It was an oil filled swamp with unhealthy vegetation and very little wildlife . Suncor is cleaning up the natural oil spill that nature left there.
1386 2018-02-14 20:40:30 I hate both but I go with PSG this time just cause I'm sick of Spanish teams at the champions league. Then someone will kill psg oil money.
1387 2018-02-14 20:40:28 So just straight ACV? Thats interesting I usually just use it for my hair .. I put TT oil on my face straight once and almost died then I read that it needs to be in an carrier oil lol

1389 2018-02-14 20:40:11 Family Nutrition: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this February? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.

1391 2018-02-14 20:40:08 So when excatly is the UN going to do something about Turkey profittering off of Syrian oil when it was in ISIS hands.
1392 2018-02-14 20:40:05 Amazing what investing in alternative energy and bringing down demand for oil does to the price of gas, isn't it?
1393 2018-02-14 20:39:56 The thing is the whole Syrian campaign started because Putin couldn't agree with tribe leaders that the Syrian civil war won't affect his oil factory. They didn't pledge to him and he send his army, later came to the idea of having PMC when Slavonic Corp went belly up.
1394 2018-02-14 20:39:49 Love your engine? Treat it to Schaeffer's Oil.
1395 2018-02-14 20:39:44 oil painting is fun as hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1396 2018-02-14 20:39:44 Coming soon 
These bracelets hold essential oil pads and will also be available as a necklace!
1397 2018-02-14 20:39:36 Which oil company are the republicans invested in?
1398 2018-02-14 20:39:33 Greatest oil reserves in the world are taken over by the government and now the people starve; ain't Socialism grand!
1399 2018-02-14 20:39:24 “So I’m gonna add some oil to the pan… whoops” says Kay, as she lines the frying pan with a thick layer of oil.
1400 2018-02-14 20:39:12 That’s one low grade olive oil there lad - we are high performance machines man.
1401 2018-02-14 20:39:06 inclined to agree, but XOM is an oil company, so I imagine he is asking for a market signal.
1402 2018-02-14 20:39:00 One pot of oil and one pot of broth. Fondue bourguignonne?! Anyway, seriously disappointed. You live and learn. #förbannad
1403 2018-02-14 20:38:58 Just gave away a free oil change for a box of donuts
1404 2018-02-14 20:38:45 yeah! i make my own lip scrub with sugar, honey, and coconut oil. it works well for taking off lipstick
1405 2018-02-14 20:38:39 If you're not shaving with coconut oil wyd??
1406 2018-02-14 20:38:31 Fixing Attendance: Climate controlled stadiums. I’m there. Love Lucas Oil. @ManAndBone971
1407 2018-02-14 20:38:30 Doesn't work that way.  The equivalent would be to say no more debt.  Globe must use what money exists.  Result would economic collapse, until globe adjusted.  Not much of a solution to inflation.  Like stopping increase in use of oil would cause major collapse, too.  Balance!
1408 2018-02-14 20:38:27 You know you’re tired when you napped for 15 minutes while gettin your oil changed and it was incredible.
1409 2018-02-14 20:38:19 The royal oil supermegamoneyball is quite a good game. Emirate?
1410 2018-02-14 20:38:09 How much weed can you possess in CO.  20 bags that would be  intent to sale.. now the butter i am interested in, is that like using the oil.
1411 2018-02-14 20:38:02 I think he got a little oil on his jacket there
“Mother do you see me?”
1412 2018-02-14 20:37:47 Yes that’s just how I pictured you and @HellieCres burning the midnight oil so you can get your cards to me!!
1413 2018-02-14 20:37:29 there is no chance a Republican president hot for tax cuts raises the most regressive tax imaginable that hits is rural, distance driving base the hardest. the Trump gas tax rumor is just a floated balloon. no chance #oil #oott
1414 2018-02-14 20:37:22 where can one purchase cannabis oil? Any recommendations? I’m looking for a good reputable source. Thanks.

1420 2018-02-14 20:36:13 Want fewer oil tankers in Seattle? Drink more wine... Here to tell you about oil, water, and wine is @VancouverSun columnist @VaughnPalmer. "This has erupted into a national story in Canada." #KUOWrecord
1421 2018-02-14 20:36:10 No, you misread the reality. Prior Wagner, when Wagner was not even on everyone's mind there was Slavonic Corpus. In 2013 they went for this oil factory and defended. In short - the factory is Putin's personal oil wealth asset. It's plain and simple.

1423 2018-02-14 20:35:49 $SPX $SPY Futures I bought at 2629 early this morning (which was silly)  makes me think this market up more than 2.5% from there is almost as silly.  Oil bounce helped and financials doing well with rate increase but bond selloff should be enough to spook at the margin
1424 2018-02-14 20:35:46 @taylieli 
Convulsions of frustated (Iran) commanders, seeing #Idlib slowly gets “secured”. Watching would demoralize it’s fighter so it’s a “normal” reaction.
But Turkey seems determined, and Ir/Sy can’t affort direct military confrontation=Risk Aleppo/no hope for oil/gas fields

1430 2018-02-14 20:35:20 We pay taxes so that infrastructure can be maintained.  If commercial entities are involved then they will monetize the roads and bridges.  Monetize wars... they fight for oil companies already, and keep infrastructure paid for by taxes.
1431 2018-02-14 20:35:16 I hate taking Oregano Oil shit is nasty but Im not catching the Flu
1432 2018-02-14 20:35:05 No but it proves how small a club it is and stands nowhere near Man United..

Also you won't be here to tweet this if it weren't for oil money and half a billion spent on 2nd choice players by youth developer Guardiola...
1433 2018-02-14 20:34:54 Very likely because it's the main agency that was working to address climate change, and the regime is fully committed to fossil fuels 4evar.

Which is a position that boosts Russia, where the main source of revenue is oil.

1435 2018-02-14 20:34:43 Did I hear u say no corruption scandal? What about oil money wey miss under am as petroleum minister under Military Obj?
1436 2018-02-14 20:34:42 There is a small degree of wiggle room on that, to be sure. But I'd sit there with a runner mallet to make sure people understood.
And at some point, the Oil need to double down on Euro scouting, because we haven't been good at all in that area for years.
1437 2018-02-14 20:34:39 I’m liking @LidlUK peanut butter at the moment! Sadly, I probably won’t buy it again as upon closer label inspection it contains palm oil!

1442 2018-02-14 20:34:17 l m a o the first place I wanted to go for lunch there’s an oil fire in the kitchen and the kids don’t know how to put it out....

1446 2018-02-14 20:33:53 #Correlations continue, both positive and inverse:
DXY  = Bonds Yields  = S&P  = OIL  = GOLD .
What's the common denominator? What if it hits a higher low or double bottom and rebounds? Until then, the trend is your friend.

1453 2018-02-14 20:32:50 . @shanedawson one time my mum was cooking roast chicken and accidentally sprayed it with fly spray thinking it was oil, the cans looked so alike.
1454 2018-02-14 20:32:48 Honestly, given the state of the BC Libs, if there were no wine for oil trade war, I think we'd see a much closer race with a clear Lib win in the low 40s, but a tight green/NDP fight for second around 30% apiece.
1455 2018-02-14 20:32:48 Hmm tramadol ain’t really done much yet. Neither has the muscle relaxer, the tens machine or the rosemary oil...

1460 2018-02-14 20:31:56 If you are wondering how single I am, the highlight of my Valentine’s Day 2018 thus far is listening to a podcast about olive oil.
1461 2018-02-14 20:31:50 And conversely, your actions of providing access to oil and mining interests show how much you hate the land
1462 2018-02-14 20:31:47 Gas at 116.9   Happy Valentine's Day from the Oil sector. 
1463 2018-02-14 20:31:45 C ororo
1464 2018-02-14 20:31:36 Operating like a Venezuelan state-owned oil company — subsidized rates create artificial demand, leading to higher revenues and higher losses
1465 2018-02-14 20:31:26 y does is take forever to get ur oil changed
1466 2018-02-14 20:31:13 Oh okay. Big Oil, Big Pharma, And Big Banks were simply oil, pharma, and banks to them.
1467 2018-02-14 20:31:12 He cuts taxes for corporations from 38% to 21% (17%) but then wants to increase the gas tax on everyone by $0.25/gallon.  This is nothing more than a fuqqing additional giveaway to the oil and gas industry (and his Russian mafia bosses).
1468 2018-02-14 20:30:56 people go ballistic on twitter like as though they know everything and could fix everything. as an oiler fan I know what this is like. the people of twitter couldn't amount themselves to a position in nhl management, yet they're experts on the opinion. o I know oil fans will 1/2
1469 2018-02-14 20:30:52 Fine BUT we must protect workers and the environment too! Letting oil corporations pollute groundwater or construction firms cheap out of safety for the sake of increased profits is wrong! #lovecanal

1476 2018-02-14 20:29:15 Because they get most their oil from us to drive their spotty behinds around. Also most their gas exports go to the US through Alberta.

But your right I believe they should not use one more drop. That'll show us.
1477 2018-02-14 20:29:14 No, our National forests are our pride. They provide the air we breathe without them we would choke. Say no to oil and grow it from corn instead biofuel is better for the environment, and more efficient.
1478 2018-02-14 20:29:04 i'll oil your gears bby

1487 2018-02-14 20:28:14 As I keep telling my peers:
You can’t have inflation w/o high oil prices, and oil looks set to consolidate/decline, given CoT’s and production surging.

1498 2018-02-14 20:26:17 No thanks, keep your oil over there. The future is green and your province is in denial.

Hey, @JoustaKnight! Get that cannabis oil, lets go to bed!

1536 2018-02-14 20:19:18 I... I don't wanna mind my business. I want to know the products sir (I have no room to judge I bought a 26 dollar cuticle oil). LOL
1537 2018-02-14 20:19:18 What’s this “inflation” you speak of? Inflation, in virtually every instance, is caused by a production/supply issue. For example, the rise in oil prices in the ‘70s was due to the OPEC oil embargo not fiscal policy. Volker destroyed labor’s bargaining power, his actual object.
1538 2018-02-14 20:19:14 Calpers should invest in marijuana oil solar tobacco.   Renegotiate their investment contracts they take too much of the pension funds. Check it out.

1542 2018-02-14 20:18:38 Of course, Pruitt is having "unpleasant interactions with other travelers." He's not doing the people's work. Pruitt is working for the oil and gas industry and those who want to pollute our earth for short term profits.

Yes, I made my hair myself.

1580 2018-02-14 20:14:26 You look like a by product of oil refinement
1581 2018-02-14 20:14:18 So dying to get oil fields is considered martyrdom now?

1583 2018-02-14 20:14:03 Never gonna happen. Look how tough it was to build the 50,000 b/d Sturgeon refinery, the first one in AB in over 30 yrs. And the cost per barrel of capacity are waaaay higher than refineries elsewhere. We'll have stopped using oil by the time AB builds another refinery.

1597 2018-02-14 20:12:08 Point taken but what do you classify as a few people?  This country economic engine is the Oil industry and thus, it is needed in order for Canada to exist as a have nation. The future technologies will pemit better energy sources but until that happens, Oil is the present driver

1605 2018-02-14 20:11:25 What?!? 

President Donald Trump’s infrastructure plan would give Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke the power to greenlight pipelines through national parks.

Currently, constructing oil or gas pipelines on National Park Service (NPS) land requires an act of Congress.

1646 2018-02-14 20:06:31 Its hard to read off diversification form shares of gdp, because prov gdp so over-determined by oil and gas sector.  So for example, if the the price of oil drops and output in that sector stays the same, then it will look like diversification will have increased.

1652 2018-02-14 20:05:43 There's that, but this is also just one more item he is checking off the Oil & Coal industry's wishlist. The Kochs are largely behind Trump's anti-environmental crusade. They waged war against Obama's energy & environment agenda and have been bankrolling Republicans ever since.
1653 2018-02-14 20:05:40 Oil light comes on 30 minutes after an oil change but sure, let's let these things drive themselves!
1654 2018-02-14 20:05:31 How this man trump can put our park land up for oil drilling etc. and alot of that land has sacred artifacts and drawings on it. So thats not a concern of his either. Enough has been taken from the American Indians! Just not acording to trump.
1655 2018-02-14 20:05:24 It'd be a thick carrot soup then, rather than a creamy one. Do you have substitutes for butter/oil when you're browning or frying things in a pan, or do you have to avoid using anything?

1689 2018-02-14 20:01:16 Oil was a bonus for Norway in a way it would never have been for Scotland. We needed the oil to partially plug our notional deficit. They could save their's. Because they focused on real underlying stuff and not a short-term resource.

1693 2018-02-14 20:00:26 Add in we didn't fix anything that caused the 2008 collapse and that the banks are acting like a casino even more now for the win. When the world shifts from the dollar indexing the price of oil, it's over for America.
1694 2018-02-14 20:00:17 It looks like she's bathing in oil 
1695 2018-02-14 20:00:14 >most championships in French history even well before oil money 
Halal is literally the epitome of oil money just after man city
1696 2018-02-14 20:00:02 Find yourself a grocery store that carrys your favorite extra-virgin olive oil.

Carpaccio of air cured beef, arugula, shaved parmesan and olive oil
1698 2018-02-14 19:59:47 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1699 2018-02-14 19:59:46 It can be a financial burden. The curse of natural resources is real. It can skewer your economy, pollution and clean up costs aside. Scotland has had a relatively well managed oil & gas industry so we've avoided the pitfalls of many nations, including Netherlands.
1700 2018-02-14 19:59:42 Lol. I may want those problems! I feel like just van oil change would be my rent. (I just googled, it's literally 10x my rent)

If you can promise to do these things I’ll donate.
1702 2018-02-14 19:59:34 Apple needs to oil my wood.
1703 2018-02-14 19:59:34 @robbwolf first, I love Wired to Eat! Second, the food matrix is SO helpful in finding healthy, tasty meals without having to make a time consuming recipe. Just had a pork chop with mushrooms, cooked in avacado oil & garlic powder!
1704 2018-02-14 19:59:21 thank god for grapeseed oil. and cucumber witch hazel. skin saver
1705 2018-02-14 19:59:07 Armageddon Question: Is it not easier to train astronauts how to drill than to train oil drillers to be astronauts????
1706 2018-02-14 19:59:02 Point is the oil still exists almost 30 yrs later & is as damaging to the environment today as the day it was spilled. Projection is it will take centuries to dissipate. We have a responsibility to protect BC's marine ecosystem so history does not repeat itself. #BCunderthebus
1707 2018-02-14 19:58:48 "I'm going to need an oil drum, some white paint, and a green marker.

Also about 30 gallons of coffee."
1708 2018-02-14 19:58:46 For the first time ever I'm shouting for Madrid, hard to respect sides built with Oil money, Madrid are what they are, they are everything I hate in a club, but at least they're self sustained, they have built it throughout the decades, can't say the same for City/PSG
1709 2018-02-14 19:58:44 When I make Spanish tortilla, I use a small, well-seasoned, cast iron skillet and a heavy plate. 

The trick it to use only a small amount of olive oil for the final step, otherwise you're pouring boiling oil out along with the omelet when you flip it out of the pan.
1710 2018-02-14 19:58:43 Girl let me tell you a hack I learned from being pregnant: Aloe Vera, Witch Hazel, Lavender Oil and or Rosemary Oil.  All in a spray bottle. Thank me later.
1711 2018-02-14 19:58:38 now if you’ll excuse me I need to use the restroom to rip pieces of toilet seat covers to use as face oil blotting papers

1714 2018-02-14 19:58:27 Got my car back.  Apparently several seals went on my car.  I had almost no  oil and low other fluids.  Thank goodness I got the extended warranty on my car.
1715 2018-02-14 19:58:25 I didn’t add any oil! It was just enough water to create a healthy dose of steam in the pan.
1716 2018-02-14 19:58:11 I FORGOT THE FUCKING OLIVE OIL IVE FORGOTTEN IT FOR TWO WEEKS NOW GOD FUCKING DAMN IT
1717 2018-02-14 19:58:11 Awesome! Good luck this weekend. Show the big money teams how its done!
1718 2018-02-14 19:58:10 Americans prefer being in bumper to bumper traffic breathing each other’s exhaust fumes, having a gas guzzlers that cost too much and doesn’t last long,bad gas mileage and car insurance. The price of elbow room . Make big oil & auto industry very sad.
1719 2018-02-14 19:58:04 You can't go wrong with the garlic oil! Cheers!
1720 2018-02-14 19:58:01 The American Oil companies have destabilised the country. In effect Causing the inflation to rise to a ridiculous level. Tory arms sales were all part of the plan to help destabilise Venezuela. It's always about Oil and money everyone knows that.
1721 2018-02-14 19:57:47 Can you QA something like this? I’m no expert in product testing but can you adequately test for every combination of wood and the oil that’s used? I do agree that it’s an issue that needs to be addressed in some way.
1722 2018-02-14 19:57:45 Shoutout to @jennyrsalinas who did a great job speaking at the @amahouston luncheon today. The audience was big, and her talk was encouraging for people hoping to see oil and gas move forward in today's evolving marketplace.
1723 2018-02-14 19:57:36 I just blew my nose into a paper towel with oil paint and gamsol all over it
1724 2018-02-14 19:57:33 I am envious. Wish I still had one if the early ones. You have a piece of history there pls treasure it. Make sure you oil it first and warm it gently then clean it with paper before using it. Kh
1725 2018-02-14 19:57:32 I need someone to suggest professional courses one can take in Oil & Gas Law, and good books too.
1726 2018-02-14 19:57:23 The earth doesn't tilt. There is no possible way that a ball earth could have uniform mass. The top would be heavier than the bottom or one side would be. Mining and drilling oil and moving stones from one place to another like the pyramids, would screw up the tilt and we would
1727 2018-02-14 19:57:22 @MikeHudema No there isn't a leak every day. I live here I should know. You think we here in Alberta would live here with a leak everyday. Boy oh boy goggle it. We need oil for everything we do. Goggle 50 things made from oil you can't live without.

1734 2018-02-14 19:56:51 His Mom was an American citizen who had Ted while working for an oil company in Alberta, same rule applies to soldiers having children overseas. Just wanted to clarify.

1738 2018-02-14 19:56:28 You didn't do anything wrong. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise! It's a good thing u ddnt respond. Anyone who can insult u like that is toxic! So good riddance.
1739 2018-02-14 19:56:06 Man goes to doctor and says he's sure he needs bloodletting, Stanley's snake oil liniment, and electro-shock treatment. Wouldn't we see the doctor as being a better doctor if she gave him what he really needed? Of course, Litmos didn't just provide bloodletting, it advertised it!

1741 2018-02-14 19:55:59 @sithrak  (oil be upon his many spits) has no need to communicate further. Eternal torment is the message; there is no 'Complaints' line. Also, no returns.
1742 2018-02-14 19:55:46 Believe it or not, WD-40! It’s main ingredient is fish oil. I have seen it work miracles on several horses hooves. Plus it’s affordable.
1743 2018-02-14 19:55:37 The only ones holding #Canada and our economy hostage is the @CPC_HQ, @RachelNotley, @jkenney, and #UCP. BC will not be bullied into accepting pipelines or dirty Tar Sands oil on the coast. They need to stop whining and accept that fact. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #CPCBigots
1744 2018-02-14 19:55:37 Earth is a giant ant farm and oil comes from sad ex-wife's and metallic guitar riffs@TheFordFaction
1745 2018-02-14 19:55:32 @InnovOil Our Quantum_Quench technology is one of those (major) innovations. Able to shut down any oil and gas blowout in hours or days, instead of months!
1746 2018-02-14 19:55:20 This Girl Scout Cookie strain of oil might just be my favorite.

1752 2018-02-14 19:54:52 Do you guys use butter or cooking oil to make pancakes?
1753 2018-02-14 19:54:43 Shredder for president. At least sometimes he almost “gets those turtles” and he isn’t owned by the oil industry.

1755 2018-02-14 19:54:25 Jotaro threw up on the hallway rug after eating 32 consecutive cans of tuna in olive oil then turned around and without breaking a sweat opened the 33rd
1756 2018-02-14 19:54:22 Lucky you having oil money to promote this ad to stomp on the environment. There are so many concerns with the implementation of this pipeline that have not/will not be addressed.
1757 2018-02-14 19:54:15 @riskstaff Our Quantum_Quench(TM) technology should greatly lower risk associated with oil and gas blowouts.  Should reduce damage potential by as much as 95%!
1758 2018-02-14 19:54:14 My thought is to do both. Use other countries resources to supplement our solar/wind since the sun doesn't shine at night and storing the energy is expensive. Keep our own reserves of coal/natural gas/oil, for when they all run out. Conserve and conquer.
1759 2018-02-14 19:54:09 Maybe, but “SoyBoy” shuts it down.

(What if I told you Mayonnaise had soybean oil in it?  B-plowww!  mind blown).
1760 2018-02-14 19:54:05 I spent a week there one night.
1761 2018-02-14 19:54:02 "Cheese food". Made from oil. Yum. So glad they will deliver me "food". They are delivering to cars, right?
1762 2018-02-14 19:54:00 Yet none of you can look up and see the sun and tell that it’s a better option for energy? All about getting the big oil companies rich

1768 2018-02-14 19:53:34 Oil your scalp and be humble.  
1769 2018-02-14 19:53:33 You can't blame the troops. Bad call for him...

But you can blame the oligarchs who put them there to run their military industrial complex for oil riches.. because what war are we fighting that we need 800 bases in 70 countries? Are we the world's military? Guess so..
1770 2018-02-14 19:53:31 Get your hair done, take a long beautiful shower or take a nice bath n after put on some coconut oil spray some nice body mist and  scented perfume and get dress, do your makeup or not  and love the heck out of yourself because you’re fucking amazing. 
1771 2018-02-14 19:53:29 I live in Alberta and I understand the need for jobs, but shouldn't we be diversifying? We have access to geothermal, solar and wind energies that could create lots of jobs here, but we continue to push oil! It's not good for our environment!  Time to change!

1775 2018-02-14 19:53:04 why is coconut oil so expensive
1776 2018-02-14 19:52:57 @Valvoline went to the Orchard Park location. Oil change filter change drove 100 miles, then all the sensors went off! They forgot to reconnect the air hose to the sensor! Sensor blew! Guess how much extra that cost me

1778 2018-02-14 19:52:53 Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it will further trim oil production and exports next month to reduce excess stockpiles that have weighed on crude prices, as concerns mount over US oversupply.

1819 2018-02-14 19:47:15 Uhhh, nope. Too much carbs, salt, oil, and even tons of not natural additives. But you could always do what I do: Add a good brand of sliced hot dog, and cut up zucchini.
1820 2018-02-14 19:47:09 Stop using the byproduct of dead animals--- petroleum and coal! The  souls of Dinosaurs will not forgive you! Your karma will haunt you.
 Oil is non vegetarian. Stop running vehicles. Stop the entire economy.

1823 2018-02-14 19:46:53 Though. I might just wait til tomorrow to get the battery. It has been a long while since it's been replaced.
But i just came here for an oil change. Not planning to drop $150 for then to replace it when i can just buy one for cheaper. Its not hard to replace.
1824 2018-02-14 19:46:50 Yes, depending on your choice of hand oil finishes.

1831 2018-02-14 19:45:46 Yep they are very open about a lot of their ingredients. But to be honest, 10 years on... come on. It's mostly a surfactant issue I'm guessing but there are other surfactants on the market now that have zero palm oil.
1832 2018-02-14 19:45:42 Just hope with a blooming but cleaner oil industries across Alberta  B.C. or even the whole Canada at large, together we can create a strong enough economy to result in more affordable insurance and commodities. Plus bonus of delicious red wine. A $70M to Alberta business

1840 2018-02-14 19:44:53 What an utterly ridiculous comparison. 
Countries such as ones you mention used oil to fuel their dictatorships with wealth and not the people living there.
I'm sure you're not suggesting and Indy Scots Gov compares with the likes of Iraq of course.
1841 2018-02-14 19:44:43 Another note, the oil change shop gave me a flower for Valentine’s Day. But they called it a rose yet it’s a carnation. So I called them out on their bullshit and lies.

1855 2018-02-14 19:42:57 Be careful because this could turn out really bad if you add too much water to oil.

1859 2018-02-14 19:42:21 It's not bad but it will never compare to fried. I really don't see any diff between this and tossing fries/etc in a little oil and using a nonstick baking sheet in an oven.

1864 2018-02-14 19:41:22 Just seeing todays closing prices in gold and base metals now. Very strong rallies, super stuff.  Oil not wanting to be outdone either and closing up almost 2.5% (a later rally). P/f adjusted today, should be better still tomorrow.
1865 2018-02-14 19:41:08 I can’t seem to handle much oil these days.
1866 2018-02-14 19:41:05 I’m sure it is. The reason I took the capsules was because I had two jars of non food grade oil and I didn’t want a third. But I’m almost done with my current jar so when I reup, I’ll get food grade quality.
1867 2018-02-14 19:41:02 This oil move today was free money. Was expecting this and didn’t pull trigger long so I’m sidelined as spectator. Thankfully my members weren’t flat footed with the trigger as some of them caught this! Crazy parabolic move

Then the H2 'isn't efficient/energy loss' meme flies against reality of age of Oil+ICE era. Question is future cost curves. What scales? For me, fuels. Cheers!

1901 2018-02-14 19:37:00 I have a theory that they are in bed with the major gas and oil companies. See I think they SOMETIMES are on the ball, so as not to raise suspicion - but they typically don’t save you any time so that you drive around more and spend more gas and then spend more ON gas....
1902 2018-02-14 19:36:54 What happened the “I told u so” guys that were out this morning when oil was ? Could it be this market is tighter then wat the slanted IEA says? Oil Inv builds in the US have started the year at the best rate since 2003.. which was the beginning of a multi year bull run #OOTT
1903 2018-02-14 19:36:53 I forgot the hair factor of using oil but you get it

1905 2018-02-14 19:36:36 Unemployment rate artificially low - look at labor participation rate.  No real danger of wage inflation, which is the only thing that’s going to cause inflation in this market except for oil input
1906 2018-02-14 19:36:10 i was going to buy the olive oil but uh.. what would i do with it
1907 2018-02-14 19:35:51 1/2 First, not Trolling!  This logic (cost) is what oil folks said about BEVs for years. H2 can be produced cheaply, cleanly. H2 refueling equip costs will drop. Refueling scales in urban markets. I don't believe true costs of grid dependent vehicles wins with 100s million of EVs
1908 2018-02-14 19:35:41 Its time to move away from oil to something more environmentally friendly

1917 2018-02-14 19:33:38 oh, I believe it works, I just likes me some good fryin' oil!!! It's one of the few pleasures in life
1918 2018-02-14 19:33:29 A bit of cod liver oil will shift that

None of you have a plan, so asking us all to jump in “..with confidence” is just plain ignorant and, without substance, is the same old snake oil you’ve been peddling for years.

Leave won on lies and even now you have no positives?
1949 2018-02-14 19:30:52 But has B.C. received the economic benefits from the Alberta oil, too? In 2016 alone, just the Enbridge Pipeline alone has provide $62.35m on property taxes for related facilities, $6.6m corporate income tax and $19.32m on payroll, fuel and excise taxes across B.C.

1963 2018-02-14 19:29:15 People won’t let us drill on our soil but when we try to go elsewhere for oil they get pissed. It really is about time that we move to green energy at least for houses/buildings and eventually cars when it gets to that practical of a point.

1968 2018-02-14 19:28:30 I’ve only had it in capsules, although I sometimes get food grade coconut oil for my skin and hair. I’ll have to try it.
1969 2018-02-14 19:28:21 I hope you are not disappointed! Make sure you use enough olive oil when roasting- eggplant is one thirsty sucker. Also just freshly grated garlic, some salt and pepper will suffice seasoning wise, but you can add whatever. It's my fave roasted veg, other than mushroom!
1970 2018-02-14 19:28:16 .@taxpayerDOTcom opposes corporate welfare for aerospace, we oppose it for big auto, we oppose it for oil, we oppose it for the tech sector, and we oppose it for newspapers. 

It is not the job of governments to force taxpayers to subsidize failing private businesses. Full stop.

1984 2018-02-14 19:26:54 From the original Apple response, it sounds like it’s just oil finishes (fairly rare on mass produced items). In which case it probably is chemical. But oil finishes need yearly maintenance anyway. This is the kind of thing you are signing up for with an oil finish.
1985 2018-02-14 19:26:51 BC should stop destroying millions of acres of air cleaning forests & turning the landscape into Saudi Arabia. BTW no more trucks & trains of dangerous deadly chemicals east trough Alberta towns & cities! We’ve had evacuations in the past. Vanc gets 90’/. of oil from Alta.
1986 2018-02-14 19:26:47 yeah but have you tried eating the coconut oil i'm talking about, by itself? hahaha.  Coconut water is the best, but that's a completely diff part of the coconut of course.

1995 2018-02-14 19:24:55 No worries!!! Just use the oil and that should help!! And if you think it will help, just remove the jewelry when you shower and put it back in after. That helped me get used to it fastt
1996 2018-02-14 19:24:52 How much oil do they really have??
1997 2018-02-14 19:24:48 my one and only tip for life: heat butter and olive oil in pan. add chillis, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, black pepper & salt. Fry some cashew nuts in it until golden brown. Add juice of 1 lime, stir, remove from heat.

2032 2018-02-14 19:20:58 2/2 I was thrilled when she became Premier, but it didn't take long for her politics to be completely co-opted by the oil industry. We need politicians that have enough integrity to not let that happen. Those politicians are very rare.
2033 2018-02-14 19:20:57 Scotland isn't poor, by any international measure. The U.K./Scotland hasn't really suffered the "curse of natural resources" seen in the oil field disaster zones . We've fared rather well.

2040 2018-02-14 19:19:58 CBD hemp oil is made from high-CBD, low-THC hemp, unlike medical marijuana products, which are made from plants with high concentrations of psychoactive (THC). Because hemp contains only trace amounts of THC, these hemp oil products are non-psychoactive
2041 2018-02-14 19:19:51 Tillerson: The US & coalition forces today control 30% of the Syrian  territory, and control a large amount of the population, and control a  large amount of Syria's oil fields.
Maybe now some ppl will cease refering to the American "indifference" to #Syria

2055 2018-02-14 19:18:36 Isn’t hemp oil slightly different again though? Or have I confused something.
2056 2018-02-14 19:18:28 Oil prices were pretty bouyant back in 14, to be fair, & that fed the "sixth richest country in world" rhetoric. But I don't think there was a future petro bonanza claim, though Sillars had a line. Crucially, I'm not sure oil dreams win over sceptical middle class soft No voters
2057 2018-02-14 19:18:26 And then just weeks later, Obama lifted their 40-year crude oil export ban...

2062 2018-02-14 19:18:01 But in the case of Alberta, that turned out not to be such a great thing. Notley has become one of the biggest cheerleaders for the oil sands and pipelines, even to the point of threatening trade sanctions against BC if they don't allow the pipelines to be built. 1/2

2071 2018-02-14 19:17:01 We are heavily invested in commodity exports from out of sub-urban Africa. Exports include cash crops like cashew, oil palm, cotton and cocoa. We export both raw and processed products.

2090 2018-02-14 19:14:18 Oil can be a burden. Right now we're facing public money being used to support the industry and decommissioning (& bracing ourselves for the climate change it causes). Sure, global factors are at play here and smart management may mitigate risk.

2114 2018-02-14 19:10:56 sad to get shot of ma wee motor.  steering light was on, engine light was on, airbag light was on, oil leaks, lights oot, mirrors broke but still managed 300 mile a week on that bypass without a breakdown  deserves an RAF flyby imo

2120 2018-02-14 19:10:36 Disagree, oil price estimates were important in the mainstream in 2014 too as were windfall claims.
2121 2018-02-14 19:10:32 What the hell for?  They sell enough oil to pay for what they need. Is that to support the Shi’a in Baghdad who discriminate against the Kurds and the Sunni and Yazidi?

2130 2018-02-14 19:09:38 Did anyone   b esides me  notice the damn oil companies have not given us back a damn thing?
2131 2018-02-14 19:09:37 BC doesn't want more of Alberta's dirty oil. Refine it domestically if you want to do something with it, because you aren't piping more thru our coast. Period. Not going to happen.
2132 2018-02-14 19:09:31 I didn't say oil had run out. But we can only hope our rulers can find a way to keep a fair bit of it under the sea while trying not to lose too much money on it. A tough balancing act bearing in mind the real economic challenge we face is climate change.
2133 2018-02-14 19:09:29 Quite.  Hannan is the worst sort of lisping Brexit snake oil salesman though.

Most people don't want to give money to companies like Shell oil and BP since they raped the environment for many years.

Plus your metrics are quoting 2023 do you think the EV charging install  is going to slow down?
2142 2018-02-14 19:07:58 More likely the Museveni of 1986 would say "A job well done" as he ducked from bullets, had no sugar or salt and have to queue daily for fuel and cooking oil. You kids are so out of touch with history and reality.
2143 2018-02-14 19:07:55 But the oil money has got you where you are now. You can’t deny that. Same as Chelsea same as PSG.

2145 2018-02-14 19:07:38 Ok fair. But what if you set up a website that clearly illustrated Moroccan oil treatments for cars priced slightly worse than her Groupon, and simply sent her the link w/ a "looks like you got a good deal" comment.
2146 2018-02-14 19:07:30 No one on this thread was poor enough to remember the huge blocks of processed orange American “cheese” and the enormous industrial tubs of hydrogenated oil peanut butter ... because ... yeah, I do. I still feel uneasy around bright orange things that aren’t citrus fruit or vegs.
2147 2018-02-14 19:07:24 Agreed. Oil is also extremely abundant and will be even moreso with loosening regulations and oversight. There's not much of an opportunity in that space unless prices firm significantly IMO.
2148 2018-02-14 19:07:22 But as I gaze upon the birdseed it does not strike me as especially grindable. No black oil sunflower seed coffee today!

2155 2018-02-14 19:06:53 Did you read the comment he was answering? To say the least it was a lot of shite. Scotland is a rich nation with or without oil and as part of or not part of UK. At the moment anyway.
2156 2018-02-14 19:06:44 Word from Saudi Arabia as they move to stabilize the recent fall in oil prices. saudi's are prepping to cut an additional 100K barrels a day starting in March to keep oil prices elevated. Oil is up some on the news. #Oilprices

2160 2018-02-14 19:06:05 After 16 years of Bush-Obama followed by Trump, for heaven's sake, how can you say that the state is anything more than a servant of Wall Street and the Oil companies, who are busily squabbling over who has more influence?
2161 2018-02-14 19:06:04 He quoted an entire website 
2162 2018-02-14 19:05:57 Well, it certainly have proIndy forces a leg up in the 70s & older diehards cling to being cheated out of oil as an article of faith. Surely less relevant now despite online banter?
2163 2018-02-14 19:05:44 A few months ago, I was thinking energy producers presented an opportunity as the boom expands...
Alas no regrets that I held back from those ETFs...

Prognoses in Bloomberg suggest electric will outsell combustion powered vehicles within a decade.

Oil is probably no long hold.
2164 2018-02-14 19:05:43 For Example:
1940: Germany Wins the battle of Britain, Operation Sealion is a partial success and Britain signs a white peace with Germany
1941: With the Allies gone, Japan has an oil supply in the Pacific and doesn't bomb Pearl Harbor
2165 2018-02-14 19:05:38 stocks runs up, oil runs up, energy sector runs up, stocks run up, oil runs up more on stocks....

2180 2018-02-14 19:03:47 That's rubbish, I'm afraid. Oil can be a burden. It can really hurt your economy, including advanced ones, if not managed properly. See the Netherlands. Are these indyref-era garbage Twitter memes really still banging about the Internet?

2236 2018-02-14 18:57:18 Seriously, i mean...someone in the beauty community could tell people vegetable oil is the best skin care regimen and ppl would be out here smellin like fried chicken and clogged pores for days.
2237 2018-02-14 18:56:50 Simple solution...register as a lobbyist for either the oil industry or big pharma.  20 seconds will turn into 4 hours!
2238 2018-02-14 18:56:50 Today I bought some olive oil spray in the new Hornsey Sainsbury. Nailing the healthy eating by using it to make chips.
2239 2018-02-14 18:56:44 I despise Coconut everything. Well, everything except: Coconut Oil, Goya Cookies & Malibu
2240 2018-02-14 18:56:39 pics or it didn't happen, also please report on how much oil you get out of it 
2241 2018-02-14 18:56:34 okay yeah. so the rotating hurts cause your skin is still getting used to the foreign object in it. i didn’t use oil but it’s rlly good cause it’ll make your jewelry go in smoother. idk if it’s the normal piercing pain or if it’s something more, but I’d say keep it a bit longer
2242 2018-02-14 18:56:25 What’s the argument to *NOT* do this? Oilers gonna oil?
2243 2018-02-14 18:55:36 Oil!
2244 2018-02-14 18:55:29 I love that we are comparing government given food to blue apron. Am I the only one who remembers the cheese,powdered milk  and eggs and peanut butter with the oil on top.
2245 2018-02-14 18:55:11 I certainly did not @Todd_Murphy1, purchase a number of fine oil companies in the recent market retracement, sold deep out of the money puts and waited for the rebound before selling calls with expiration on Friday. All in.
2246 2018-02-14 18:55:06 I personally either use Ultrabland cleanser from @lushcosmetics with a hot moist wash cloth or just coconut oil with cotton rounds or a dry wash cloth. Hope that helps 
2247 2018-02-14 18:54:41 Meanwhile Oklahoma is in the toilet, can’t pay teachers,4 day school week,can’t pass a budget,wants to tax citizens instead of big oil,fracking causing earthquakes, etc, etc, but hey let’s focus on this. What an idiot!
2248 2018-02-14 18:54:40 Warfare is inevitable.  Land, oil, money have provided the impetus for wars.  Blockchain is the next impetus for potential warfare in the future.  Blockchain Wars I and potentially II, will be for this reason: miscommunication within the unregulated blockchain.
2249 2018-02-14 18:54:38 I spent the early morning snuggling my cat (date #1) now I am at Walmart, getting my car new tires and an oil change (date #2) then I’m gonna play WoW with itsabeta (date #3) and then raid with my guild later (date #4) and then maybe date #5?
2250 2018-02-14 18:54:34 Intel is only as good as the men and women collecting it.  Many times its snake oil purchased from questionable actors.  In addition our adversaries routinely push out disinformation to disrupt American foreign policy.

2253 2018-02-14 18:54:12 This gop has stained democracy. Acting more like dictators than democracy process. Remember these are the same people that have killed 10,000 soldiers in Iraq for a barrel of oil That did not benefit the American citizens or national security just put a dollar in the 1% pocket
2254 2018-02-14 18:54:11 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i asked for it thats racist chinese aww cute how the ladder is sexie
2255 2018-02-14 18:54:03 so you spend some money on it and now you want to finish it?  to what.. not "waste" all that "money"?  meanwhile billions more spent on clean up from your mess as well as life lost along the way.  just forget the oil and go for renewable resources..seriously.

2261 2018-02-14 18:53:30 Harrison Salisbury, Herb Mitgang and I launched  the Op-Ed Page in September 1970. Our charge was to publish opinions, both left and right, that wouldn't ordinarily appear on the editorial page. That included Black Panthers andTexas oil men.
2262 2018-02-14 18:53:25 Stop listening to skin care you read online. Witch hazel, Aztec clay mask, and tea tree oil isn’t for everyone
2263 2018-02-14 18:53:24 bless oil pens 
2264 2018-02-14 18:53:17 Wow this is life changing. Sugar, oil and salt are wreaking havoc in my "healthy" vegan diet.
2265 2018-02-14 18:53:10 Interesting - this and your other one. Yes, O&G provides relatively few jobs per dollar of investment. Attempting to fix unemployment by growing that sector would require immense (likely unachievable) investment. Even at height of oil boom, unemployment was well over 10%. .../1
2266 2018-02-14 18:53:00 OK...in 50 years...maybe we can reduce world dependency on oil. But you won't see it in your lifetime!
2267 2018-02-14 18:52:53 Let's share the CBD oil out of it

2271 2018-02-14 18:52:14 Iran Iraq war. They fought with one another though they 'ld 've realized they are the source of not only world's crude oil. But blessings. According to me they would soon realize their response what everyone 'ld do to the world as how Sun, Moon & Stars appears & disappears.
2272 2018-02-14 18:51:32 I thought I would have an answer once I started reading this, but I haven't actually had that problem before. I never used oil, so that could be a thing. I am useless, I apologize

2275 2018-02-14 18:50:44 And yet she endorsed Hillary, a candidate that loves her oil. The irony is strong here.
2276 2018-02-14 18:50:44 The state department is run by Tillerson, of course the former head of Exxon doesn’t want more sanctions when he’s busy building better business environments for oil conglomerates.

2283 2018-02-14 18:50:14 The secret is finding stuff that wont break you out. Noxema is great after the st lives exfoliate but I have to use the cetephil after to make sure it's totally off. Then you have to use lotion on your face after or it will produce extra oil from the Noxema. It's All a balance.
2284 2018-02-14 18:50:12 Rite on..go kick some a $$

2287 2018-02-14 18:49:54 It gets me angry how my grandma tells me she gets her car washed or oil changed when she gets in again, all of her change or music CDs are stolen. Must be easy for those workers to steal from old ladies.
2288 2018-02-14 18:49:51 Packed by the families of soldiers who died on campaigns in oil wars. Should drop them all on Israel that would be ironic.

2300 2018-02-14 18:48:43 @Take5_OilChange in college station, Texas was probably the best, nicest and quickest oil change experience I’ve ever had.  10/10 would recommend when you don’t have time to do it yourself.
2301 2018-02-14 18:48:40 She deserves the world

2305 2018-02-14 18:47:47 Wonder what swindle that weasel faced, snake oil salesman Oscar De La Hoya is cooking up for the 5th of May
2306 2018-02-14 18:47:23 Forest fires and drought are not cheap. There's a huge cost from burning fossil fuels and oil companies don't pay it. Real people do.
2307 2018-02-14 18:47:21 I found that when I lather on coconut oil, I don't get bitten by mosquitoes as much... Go figure. 
2308 2018-02-14 18:47:20 Yay! So glad you guys don't use palm oil!
2309 2018-02-14 18:47:13 That's legit! 
I used noxema for a bit but it made my face break out. Almost everything does . The baby wash was good during the cold months as a moisturizer. I will try the coconut oil though!!! I don't use sunscreen either and I know I should so a 2 for 1 is a good start :)
2310 2018-02-14 18:47:11 So socialism will work provided capitalists pay artificially high prices for socialist oil and capitalists will carry on making all the stuff socialists need?

2327 2018-02-14 18:44:53 Or you could use an oil, massage your face with it so all the makeup dissolved and then take a wet washcloth and wipe it all away

2334 2018-02-14 18:44:11 I was just talking to a friend of mine about the "oil curse" that can plague countries suddenly flush with cash--there might be a parallel here. (but I'm no data scientist)

2337 2018-02-14 18:43:48 A few years ago I made the rookie school chaplain mistake of mixing the ashes not with oil but with water - making them extra alkaline - and leaving red crosses on the kids' heads! That caused a bit of a stir!
2338 2018-02-14 18:43:41 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
2339 2018-02-14 18:43:35 Which Kennedy made the deal with that communist thug Hugo Chavez for cheap Venezuelan heating oil for Massachusetts? Libs weren’t so concerned about ‘carbon’ that winter.
2340 2018-02-14 18:43:13 Is that a Butcher Block counter?  And did you just use Butcher Block Oil on it?  And rubber material you put on that would suck the oil up, leaving it lighter.  Have you re-applied oil and seen what it looks like?
2341 2018-02-14 18:43:10 Jeez, oil his bike chain.
2342 2018-02-14 18:43:10 This seems to becoming the norm around teams. Do they honestly think it matters to season tix holders. All I’d like from the Oil is a reduction in my tix prices until they decide to ice a good team

2347 2018-02-14 18:42:29 Moderates? These Republicans are responsible for gutting the education budget in 2011, giving away local control to oil and gas, gave away local control of housing discrimination, legislated intentional racial discrimination, & devastated women's healthcare for years. Moderate?
2348 2018-02-14 18:42:27 As long we are not putting in any effort to develop the renewable energy technologies , our investment in this field is not gonna pay off.

The solar energy is everywhere not like oil and gas, the right investment is in the technology itself.

2356 2018-02-14 18:41:21 So if we scaled oil and gas out of the gdp growth projections we would know what gdp growth forecasts for the rest of the economy were (im betting low) and that would help explain persistently high unemployment forecasts.

2378 2018-02-14 18:39:24 Given the capital required to produce oil and gas relative to the number of jobs required, and given that oil and gas is over bloated in the NLs gdp, without diversification we would expect unemployment to increase even if gdp is growing.
2379 2018-02-14 18:39:14 TBF: It *is* the story of Narrative Americans, after all.
2380 2018-02-14 18:38:48 I need a oil treatment soooo bad I’ve been rude to my hair and my momma blessed me wit good hair so I need to be appreciative  for my shit fall out on the floor AGAIN. But It always clap back and grow back fast.

2383 2018-02-14 18:38:31 Okay then.... turns out an Oil Change is NOT a good Valentines Day Present.  #Embarrassed #ValentinesDay
2384 2018-02-14 18:38:07 I was eyeing my collection in the last few weeks (I think I have well over 120+ oil paints from yesteryear), and definitely would like to dive back in at some point. :) I just want to get through my current commissions & first draft of my novel first if I can manage it! <3
2385 2018-02-14 18:38:06 Possibly a limited push on what they thought was a Kurdish-only oil field position in order to test resistance to such actions? Doesn't explain the ensuing three-hour pitched battle, though.
2386 2018-02-14 18:38:05 This oil change center has a tv that only has one channel. That one channel you ask... is fucking TMZ
2387 2018-02-14 18:38:01 I see you enjoy applying coconut oil to your butt..... I too enjoy applying organic coconut oil.
2388 2018-02-14 18:37:59 You are aware that every developed country has food banks? Including Norway, which has a lot of oil rigs. It's poor countries that don't have food banks. they depend on foreign aid, or else they starve.
2389 2018-02-14 18:37:54 Not that expensive, A couple of €10 bottles of oil a year and you are sorted

2391 2018-02-14 18:37:50 As I understand it, because of HomePod’s tweeter design, full silicone base is needed to project the sound down and out through the base. That amount of silicone can interact with some wood oil finishes, which use organic drying agents that don’t play nicely with that stuff.
2392 2018-02-14 18:37:37 This country music at the oil change place really lit. Lol
2393 2018-02-14 18:37:20 It’s actually a great feeling to flip a pancake and it goes right... no broken pancake, no folded pancake and no getting burnt by the oil or better etc. Also, big fat fluffy American pancakes are the best! 
2394 2018-02-14 18:37:09 Inflation is determined by..... oil prices!  Might as well just talk about GAS prices.   Thank you for the Nobel prize for that tidbit!

2398 2018-02-14 18:36:44 I put a half tablespoon of Earth Balance Olive Oil Spread in it.
2399 2018-02-14 18:36:43 No I bought ones with coconut oil and aloe last night and they were terrible. I didn’t see any Vick’s ones!
2400 2018-02-14 18:36:38 I am not wearing my push up bra for the sake of my man, I am wearing it so I can score a sick deal at the auto parts store because a bitch needs an oil change but she's broke until friday
2401 2018-02-14 18:36:37 @HouseGOP @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems We need to reinstate the transparency pertaining to oil and banking.  It was the 1st or 3rd piece of legislation removed by Trump and it was intentional with ulterior motives.  CAN YOU NOT SEE WHAT’S GOING ON OR DON’T U CARE?
2402 2018-02-14 18:36:26 Well Oil Machine
2403 2018-02-14 18:36:26 The plan: bomb, Syria, bomb. Assist @SenJohnMcCain's imaginary good terrorists on behalf of Israel. Take over Syrian oil and gas fields. Move the population to Germany to open the lands up for "friendly" resettlements. @AIPAC
2404 2018-02-14 18:36:21 no. The only good thing is to move to cars that are useful without gasoline at all (not ven true for most hybrids). Any other car is still 100% dependent on oil. Using less doesnt help. We need to get to zero. Those cars will stay around and pollute.

2417 2018-02-14 18:34:32 I mean there are so many rumors. I heard, Vagner was working for some private oil corporation and trying to capture oil fields. Others say it has happened because of lack of money (they allegedly have lack of ammunition). This all is very small for Putin's level.
2418 2018-02-14 18:34:30 Read up on consequences of #ExxonValdez spill.

2455 2018-02-14 18:31:40 The Trumpler Regime is jointly owned by the oil industry and Russia. Considering the importance of oil to Russia's economy, it is not surprising that Herr Trumpler would promote oil at all costs.

2522 2018-02-14 18:21:38 Tonight I’m going to be intimately rekindling an old flame. The humble jacket potato.  Please send any tips for reaching a crispy warm and delightfully smooth finish my way.  My instinct is to try a little organic sunflower oil? #mikeinthekitchen
2523 2018-02-14 18:21:34 i can’t wait for the first beach day of the year and getting to spray on tanning oil then smelling like a coconut
2524 2018-02-14 18:21:34 Let’s not forget that many of those countries got our help and money to rebuild after we reduced them to smoldering piles of rubble while ‘gifting’ them with freedom and democracy...while taking their oil and feeding the pigs in the military industrial complex.
2525 2018-02-14 18:21:17 said [the directive] was 'downright foolhardy to cut corners on safety reviews... when the industry has a history of oil spills.'
"...Obama said his administration had shown a commitment to drilling all over the nation..."

2530 2018-02-14 18:20:08 I take that back. it was mean. If I found her along side of the road, I would do exactly as she would wish.

I'd shoo away the vultures, not let medical doctors know she's there, and pour whatever essential oil she was carrying on her in order to naturally heal her.
2531 2018-02-14 18:20:04 I loveeee! I love how it is infused and it’s yellow (kinda like oil) Great job guys!
2532 2018-02-14 18:19:38 no one asked for thsi but the fish oil pills i be taking has some mint in them, so every time i burp it's a pleasant minty surprise. lol
2533 2018-02-14 18:19:33 Checking and changing your oil and oil filter will help your #engine and #vehicle run smoothly
2534 2018-02-14 18:19:24 Actually I use gut, but that is a moot point. Why do you switch the conversation about decreasing tar sands mining to my personal use of oil based products? Everyone will have to make changes in behaviour,  individuals and industries.
2535 2018-02-14 18:19:10 oh!イル
2536 2018-02-14 18:19:10 With the explosion of dairy-free milks in cool coffee shops I started reading the ingredients. People, can we do better than ‘rapeseed oil’ #metoo #timesup

2539 2018-02-14 18:18:32 Great discussion! I would simply remind that marijuana is not a pharmaceutical. It’s a safe, herbal remedy. Most people don’t need a drug maker to turn it into a pill or oil. The whole plant delivers an entourage effect that makes it so effective.

2544 2018-02-14 18:17:42 Trying to get an oil change and seeing if this car will fail inspection again. If it does, we go from there. Maybe I can get a waiver for it.
2545 2018-02-14 18:17:25 We pulled all our savings/cash from your bank. I read about your bank not financing energy projects(oil&gas) switched to local credit union.

2550 2018-02-14 18:16:55 @JamesHassell14 It's hard to beat a simple guac recipe: avocado, lime, cilantro -- maybe a little olive oil. Is that similar to your recipe?
2551 2018-02-14 18:16:38 Also kids, guess what mama is doing right now since she is onfined the bed? Warming up a bottle of coconut oil under her boob since she can’t go in the kitchen to eat it for 20 seconds so she can rub it on her nails and cuticles, I ain’t about to get ratchet fingers up in here
2552 2018-02-14 18:16:26 Just paid off my ticket, changed the oil now on my way to work, your girl feeelin productive AF

 Are there any turbo specific fuel additives?

2559 2018-02-14 18:15:47 Carrying a tin of oil based black ink in my bag and hoping it won't leak. Printer's roulette.
2560 2018-02-14 18:15:37 At no point did I say all would be good when Talbot returned. Rather that he is a far superior goaltender...and he is. This season has been toast since Nov, which I have repeatedly said. They are kidding themselves & the Oilers roster is on the higher ups.
2561 2018-02-14 18:15:35 Yinmu, with the likes of @jacksonpbn as his friends, he is definitely a paid dancer. How many Oil blocks does @ProfOsinbajo have? How many conglomerate of business does he have? When did it become a crime for someone's daughter to  find love. This is not fair

2565 2018-02-14 18:15:15 Yes time is running out the mini ice age is coming. We are going to need more coal and oil to survive
2566 2018-02-14 18:15:14 Solar panels?! I would like to see which one of his conservative "friends" would allow him to create competition for their coal, oil for energy! These guys hate the climate, why would they use solar panels? THAT will be the thinking behind the dumping of that idea.
2567 2018-02-14 18:15:11 The price for d is high. Larson is a quality d man and that was the price because hall is far from a perfect player. I totally respect anyone who says that they wouldn't have paid that price, but thats what market value was. Not fleeced based on actual market value.
2568 2018-02-14 18:15:07 Manchester is red,

2574 2018-02-14 18:13:48 Exactly, you are not credible guys. In fact, global media is not credible. when most countries won't be dependent on OIL, everything will be fine and media will again star reporting facts. It's only due to oil money that journalist are so corrupted.
2575 2018-02-14 18:13:42 Ps 133:2 

It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron’s beard, down upon the collar of his robes.
2576 2018-02-14 18:13:33 I doubt it will materialize, though. Corruption, low oil prices and buying guns will probably prevent it.

2582 2018-02-14 18:13:07 Overlooked Subban? The ask was 29, 25 and more. Would you do that? 

It's nothing to do with popularity contests. All I'm saying is tell me how many d like subban have moved in the last couple years? Subban was traded for webber! Another Olympian defenseman.
2583 2018-02-14 18:13:05 It all came off na thank goodness. I used oil. Pero ang sakit ng lashlines ko hahaha

2595 2018-02-14 18:11:08 Regarding VAT on domestic fuel in the  and everywhere: almost the entire price of heating oil is made up of Fuel DUTY, not VAT. The UK government can half the price of heating oil tomorrow without leaving the EU.

2607 2018-02-14 18:09:35 Was a very good interview and glad PV took the time to do this, explains it very well. Things are looking bright again, placing was annoying at the price but for a decent % right in the thick of the Weald. Now it’s game on #ANGS & Jonathan and his team are the best about. #OIL
2608 2018-02-14 18:09:17 Your are entitled to your opinion but what he has produced throughout his career tells us they were fleeced. Have no interest in popularity contests & that is the same group who continually overlooked Subban...means absolutely nothing to me.

2623 2018-02-14 18:07:10 Ours is more of heavy taxation on oil compared to our peers in the region
2624 2018-02-14 18:07:09 Paying 30 cents more per gallon for gas and about 50 cents more per gallon for heating oil in the last year.

2626 2018-02-14 18:07:05 Asome standardization in prep for work force is essential. In the past, kids graduated with less and it worked out. Today work force upgrades happening faster.

2644 2018-02-14 18:05:05 the way Patty pronounces the word "oil" might be the most sensual thing i have ever heard

2646 2018-02-14 18:04:54 Personally I think the return on Hall was fine. Hall is a star but is also a flawed player in eyes of nhl brass. Evidence of that is how many times he was passed up for the World Cup Team with their injuries. 6 is underrated. The rest of what chia has done is another story.
2647 2018-02-14 18:04:52 For about a month until Russia and Saudia arabia merely turn the taps up, releasing shut in production - causing the tight oil plays in the US to crash. again.

2652 2018-02-14 18:03:39 Is it just oil finishes that do this? Oil finish goes on top of a stain and is an alternative to polyurethane. Oil finishes are pretty dang rare in mass produced furniture because it requires maintenance.
2653 2018-02-14 18:03:38 Chavez and his government wasted all the money during the boost oil prices and dreamed to be a second Liberator Bolivar, nowadays with the oil prices lower facing all the types of shortage

2656 2018-02-14 18:03:14 My knee jerk reaction is to replace both, but the Oil has been down that road too often.  Each deserve a chance for redemption for the 103 pts from last year.  But definitely have a Plan B if next season first month starts the same.

2658 2018-02-14 18:03:00 Oil brings in a few million now. But that is offset by allowances and tax rebates to oil companies. Some profit, but only tax on profit counts, and tax is VERY low (John Swinney begged Osborne to drop tax on oil).
2659 2018-02-14 18:02:58 Some people really do make themselves look like right thick dickhead on here thinking  city's owners made all there through oil or maybe they r just thick dickheads

2664 2018-02-14 18:02:27 When you're talking about international relations, there are several factors at play so to say there's a simple answer to armed conflict is on its face dubious. Google  the name of a country the US is bombing and then add oil at the end of it and you'll see that these nations...

2666 2018-02-14 18:02:07 Sorry. Nigeria is not made up 3 Ethnic groups. So that Politics you celebrate only led to the domination of the Ethnic minorities in the 3 Regions. We should be pushing for a productive Union where everyone has something to offer the Centre rather than sit idly by for Oil rents.

2684 2018-02-14 18:00:24 I bought unsalted almonds the other day but I think I've find the best way to make them crisp with a light saltines:

Toast in pan with a little oil& water
Grind kosher salt in mortar and pestle (or a spice grinder I guess)

When pan has dried toss almonds in salt then

2725 2018-02-14 17:54:29 In the 60's and 70's they weren't ready for a car like that. Plus the government and their oil tycoon friends and car tycoon friendswe're not ready to deal with the future.
2726 2018-02-14 17:54:27 Wth the oil money you lot have spent over theast 2 years you should be beating everyone. Going unbeaten against Madrid twice Dortmund twice and the twice beaten finalists once fares 1000 times better.

2732 2018-02-14 17:53:02 hearing more and more from advocates that the US "needs" to do a Marshall Plan for #Venezuela recovery. despite my sympathies, I cant see why US taxpayers will feel any obligation to restore a nation with the worlds largest oil reserves that has been destroyed by its own leaders.
2733 2018-02-14 17:52:56 Ours is on finished food and there’s no marks (so far).  All of the posts I saw about it leaving marks were on oiled wood or butcher block.  Apparently people don’t realize that porous stuff will absorb the oil? Common sense is overrated these days however.

2756 2018-02-14 17:49:21 We're still 'dependent' on foreign oil because OPEC is selling/dumping oil so cheaply that it is less expensive to buy it than produce it. But that won't last.  Early in first term, Obama withdrew oil from US Strategic Oil reserve because importing it was too expensive

2798 2018-02-14 17:43:51 LOL, Reminds of the day when my best friends ex worked on oil rigs and she spent hours sewing knee highs to the front of pantyhose.
2799 2018-02-14 17:43:47 4. We would have had inflation in double digit as always with no policy on crude oil or other energy resources like solar

2802 2018-02-14 17:43:04 Hi Robbie ! I would season with salt, (not pepper yet, it burns). Heat pan over med-high heat. Smear pan with oil, and fry steaks (untouched) for 4-5mins per side. If you have a probe, 55 degrees is what you need. Rest for 5 mins. Hope you enjoy. Pete
2803 2018-02-14 17:43:01 What does GDP forecast for NL look like without oil and gas?
2804 2018-02-14 17:42:56 Ash Wednesday PSA: don’t mix the ashes with water. It will irritate the skin. Use olive oil instead.

2806 2018-02-14 17:42:46 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2807 2018-02-14 17:42:42 Until we can create a constant electric source, Coal, gas and Oil will be primary electric producers.  Lots of environmentalists understand this concept.  Wind and solar do not provide constant or predictable output.  Too much excess power is as bad as too little.
2808 2018-02-14 17:42:25 In terms of collectability, wine is like buying an  original oil painting and beer is like buying the lithograph.
2809 2018-02-14 17:42:24 Maybe, but a ring doesn’t require an oil change every 3 to 5000 miles. Rings don’t get parking tickets and you have the windows of your ring smashed and the contents stolen. 
2810 2018-02-14 17:41:49 You ain’t did shit slick to a can of oil
2811 2018-02-14 17:41:48 Iran has been playing India against China/Pak. They have reneged on giving India longer access to Chahbahar, and also on oil they promised. Now they are once again under pressure, and they want India's money and support! Dont be a fool twice! Get iron-clad guarantees for 50-year
2812 2018-02-14 17:41:43 It calls for coconut. oil. :) I can use infused coconut oil. This is going to be great. I'm glad she didn't take out all of the molasses. Thanks a million!

2816 2018-02-14 17:40:45 Uhhhh my best suggestion for fryin eggs: hot-hot oil in a non stick pan, I’m used to fryin em over a fire stove and i dont usually drop eggs in till they’re hot enough to just start cookin as soon as the egg lands in the pan
2817 2018-02-14 17:40:33 And am I to therefore presume that this product should never have palm oil contained in it?

2826 2018-02-14 17:39:24 It’s a rubber base on the HomePod, so either that’s oiled raw wood that got the oil absorbed into the rubber base, or something is sketchy.  Ours is on a lacquered wood table and zero issues so far. Granted it’s only been there 5 days.
2827 2018-02-14 17:39:23 @jimcramer EU banks indicted and paid billion dollar settlements for rigging in: Libor, Gold, currency, interest rates, derivatives, oil, HFT, co-locating supercomputers on exchanges to front run the public, and now the VIX.

2830 2018-02-14 17:39:17 when it comes down to it, to be a Democrat you only really need to be a shameless shill for one major industry - oil, war, finance, pharma - then liberals will cry about "purity" in your defense as they combine w the GOP to make everything worse.

2832 2018-02-14 17:39:08 People who refer to olive oil as e-v-o-o....I want to stab them in the neck.

2834 2018-02-14 17:38:53 But what that doesn't tell you is the total devistation of wildlife on a cropped acre vs grassland acre , or the millions of acres concentrated into oil to produce the synthetic fert/pesticide needed to grow crops without livestock . Grass Dairy has been around for 12000 years

2844 2018-02-14 17:37:35 Completely agree, get 40 minutes aerobic exercise at least 4 days a week, preferably more. Watch calories and control white carbs (white bread, pasta, rice). Remember good fats can be helpful (fish, nuts, avocado, olive oil). Lean protein can be your friend! #GoRedMi

2847 2018-02-14 17:37:26 If you are handy, just drain a little bit at a time and test as you go. Make sure you are on a level surface. Otherwise go get an oil change.

2849 2018-02-14 17:36:16 So... I just got back to my dorm, and wiped my four head thinking I’m wiping off oil... NO I’m wiping off SWEAT. Texas what is you doing?!

2884 2018-02-14 17:32:06 Okay, if you are honestly saying I can eat at Harbaugh's and consume no dairy, legumes, added sugar or sweeteners, or grains (including peanut & corn oil), you may be seeing more of me in the next month.

2906 2018-02-14 17:29:59 One does get the feeling that they are delaying until the price of oil rockets upwards.

2908 2018-02-14 17:29:42 Yep, coal is dying and we have to kill it faster.  Priority #1. If I'm looking at the pollution #s right, then oil, then gas. Coal is nasty, mercury, etc. included.  Obviously solar, wind, hydro, geo thermal need to be big focus.

2912 2018-02-14 17:29:15 That sucks, but one of the advantages of wood is that the surface can be restored so easily. Most wood furniture needs to be maintained, and looking at the other white marks on the table this one probably hasn't seen oil in a long time.

2915 2018-02-14 17:28:40 that climate change policy is pretty cool. #Election2018 we need to divert from fossil fuels and oil into solar and wind.

2922 2018-02-14 17:28:11 I'm not talking about you. The system rewards exploitation because it's profitable. Shitty bosses will do that to earn more. Deforestation for use in soy and palm oil farming leads to less biodiversity and the massive demand leads to less incentive or opportunity to farm any else

2927 2018-02-14 17:26:56 You seem to make your living from oil and gas extraction, so I'm sympathetic to your motivated reasoning, but atmospheric CO2 is irrevocably changing the climate and contributing mass extinction. It's definitely too late to mitigate all harm, but not reducing CO2 is cataclysmic.
2928 2018-02-14 17:26:48 Also, the ~$3bn being pledged as grants is about 1/8 of Iraq's CapX budget during the high oil $ years - you may remember they were running about 25bn. So even if 100% of that arrives, it is not a game-changer.

2945 2018-02-14 17:24:31 Omg ur completely missing the point of what I said. Did I say ALL oil is bad, it should all go away now? Ur just being argumentative for no reason other than to make urself look good. A balance is needed. That’s what I’m saying. How are you so deficient that u don’t get that???

2951 2018-02-14 17:23:50 Don't. Panic. Garlic, salt & lots of pepper on the steaks. Toss the asparagus in a glug of olive oil and a pinch of salt. Grill them together in a hot pan, one with ridges on the bottom if you have one. Probably 2-3 minutes per side, unless the steaks are thick. Happy V-day

2958 2018-02-14 17:23:03 Actually it’s much more than 5%. AB has barely touched renewables because oil is their game. Nothing else.

2966 2018-02-14 17:22:14 I’m not saying oil is bad, you need to stop being so angry. I’m just saying it’s time to start phasing into other forms now, work out the kinks so we are ready. Oil is dying, live with it. Time to look forwards. We want clean air and water here. Quit trying to make it worse.
2967 2018-02-14 17:22:00 There are a few ways to lower cholesterol. Diet and exercise. Eating foods high in fiber and protein and eliminate oil and butter. (1/2) #goredmi
2968 2018-02-14 17:21:41 Crude oil is used for petrol, diesel and paraffin; amongst other things. They all have a major and direct impact on jobs, food, farming, transportation et cetera. The lower the rand exchange, the cheaper the food. Go figure...

2971 2018-02-14 17:20:55 For the last 50 yrs the ME has been under turmoil: revolutions, wars, civil wars, regime changes, alliances switched, political assassinations, terror attacks.

Few things remained constant no matter the situation: oil/gas and drugs (hash/opium) - out; weapons - in.
2972 2018-02-14 17:20:46 Are you and Taylor ready to try out the oil field yet or what? 
2973 2018-02-14 17:20:41 And when those 50 yes pass & oil starts to disappear? Now is the time to transition, use both kinds of energy so that when the time comes, we are ready & established w/other forms. Your children & grandchildren will need energy. Ur ok with saying I’ve got all I need so screw u.
2974 2018-02-14 17:20:25 e.g. if you were my neighbor, invented it yourself, I knew what you created and thought it legit and would impact price of oil, generally speaking I could trade on that knowledge. /end
2975 2018-02-14 17:20:12 So around $13.00 a week that's if they included taxes taken out so not even tank of gas not enough for a steak not enough for a oil change

2984 2018-02-14 17:19:23 Renewable energy consistently supplies under 5% of the global consumption. 
Wind in AB is often zero %, especially when the weather is cold. Solar is a joke and dirtier than oil by far. Only clean alternative is nuclear.

Oil your own machine first.
2996 2018-02-14 17:18:19 Agree 100%. Spent 7 trillion overseas for what?! That’s money should’ve went to health care, education, immigration programs. Invest in green energy so we don’t feel the need to invade Middle East for oil.
2997 2018-02-14 17:18:16 Trump's policy is to "take their oil".  US has now taken half of Syria's oil.  They won't allow Kurds to export it.  I do agree with you that Kurds will grow tired of US control.

3008 2018-02-14 17:17:23 @510Ollie I want to go to disney world and wear matching ears and eat churros
3009 2018-02-14 17:17:09 And renewable energy is a passion project of mine for 15 years now. Don’t tell me what I know. I know quite a bit, and it’s moving forward quite quickly. Big oil is trying to impede that.
3010 2018-02-14 17:17:03 Never just add oil based on the last time it was changed. Physically check the level. You could do that with my old minivan, but newer better vehicles need to be checked
3011 2018-02-14 17:16:53 I'd recommend an oil change so you know the correct amount is in there. Overfilling will wreck your engine, probably seals will go before you ruin major components. Not worth the risk.  Newer car won't magically burn off what it don't need 
3012 2018-02-14 17:16:47 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

Oil is dying, move on to renewables. BC is moving forward, AB remains in the past. Sorry you can’t see that.
3016 2018-02-14 17:15:57 Oil consumption in the world will continue to rise for the next 50 years at least.
3017 2018-02-14 17:15:50 Im on about the price. So the SNPs forecast of revenue was wrong. Have a look what the middle east is doing they are preparing for a world with out oil. You guys are relying on it.
3018 2018-02-14 17:15:43 Putin purposely sends mercenaries to slaughter in Syria rather than regular conscripts so he won't be blamed at home for the death of Russians in a conflict unconnected to Russia, Russians don't know Putin wants Syria for 2 bases a hold on oil reserves and a pad to attack NATO

3032 2018-02-14 17:14:17 Did I say I had a bakery? I just answered you that solar ovens are in existence & can be used. Oil is not necessary for everything, it’s already phasing out. Albertans can’t seem to understand that. In 20 yrs AB will be same as coal country, unable to move forward with progress.

3050 2018-02-14 17:12:58 „to fry onion in oil”. 

W angielskim dodawanie „olive” jest rzadko stosowane, ponieważ zwykle jest to oliwa - u nas wyróżnia się ten „sunflower”, „soya” czy „vegetable” (i tu także - tak, rzepak to „rapeseed” ale też stosuje się tu ”canola” lub właśnie nastawienie na warzywa)

Oil demand in Saudi Arabia grew during the month of December for the first time in 4Q17 and for the fifth

3.8% y-o-y, with total oil consumption at 2.29 mb/d.

3066 2018-02-14 17:11:33 @blacklabelbeard Hi after reading your bio. I will like to get more information about private label and the minimum amount required. I'm interested in beard oil. I'm a located in South Africa.
3067 2018-02-14 17:11:30 Problem is most oil companies in Alberta are secretly US owned. Not hard for a controlling company to juggle the numbers. ie- barrels per day reported/vs actual. Maybe that why gas is around $2.00/ gal in us.dont no price now but a fraction of what we pay
3068 2018-02-14 17:11:28 Pettiness is to professionalism as oil is to vinegar.

3070 2018-02-14 17:11:19 Lol your air is not better. Air quality has been proven to be better in BC. And again, ur missing the point. You think just because it’s there that NC is ok with it. We do protest it, we also realize that some oil is necessary. Just not more. It’s a dying industry.
3071 2018-02-14 17:11:17 Supporting smallholders achieve sustainable palm oil certification is intrinsically linked to the protection of wildlife and forests as certification reduces the risk of land conversion which threatens forests and biodiversity.
3072 2018-02-14 17:11:10 Congratulations! All the best!
3073 2018-02-14 17:10:53 okay je weh, best tu tktahu la best ke dok sbb ni first oil cleanser aku. aku mcm tkleh nk compare lagi sbb tkpernah guna yg brand lain. aku rasa dia untuk all skin types. kalau oily skin pun boleh pakai sbb dia hydrates, bukan moisturizes (aku rasa la)
3074 2018-02-14 17:10:45 Nothing wrong with that rig!  Just remember that there are a bunch of those big rigs that will load up trucks that finished behind you!
3075 2018-02-14 17:10:38 Skin prep is key to keeping makeup on oily skin. Wash, use a toner (I like the Mario Badescu aloe Vera toner), moisturize (this seems counterintuitive but your skin will actually produce more oil if you don’t. I recommend the Peter Thomas Roth cloud cream moisturizer) +
3076 2018-02-14 17:10:37 You’re nothing but a snake oil salesman.

3082 2018-02-14 17:10:24 Pipeline, rail or truck..... the potential is always there for a spill.  But.. the potential is far greater with rail or truck transportation.  Are you advocating to stop moving oil all together or?
3083 2018-02-14 17:10:17 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
3084 2018-02-14 17:10:15 Exfoliating is queen! Skin does not exfoliate naturally; this is due to a lack of water, excess UV exposure or a fish oil deficiency. The skin cannot shed its layers at the proper rate, which means the oil is trapped in the skin & cannot get out to the surface, where it belongs.

3101 2018-02-14 17:07:13 So this morning, not only did you go to yoga but you prepped your lunch, got an oil change AND showed up to work 15 minutes early?

Wow.
Impressive.

I just spent the last 25 minutes seeing if I could figure out the voice-to-text difference between TO, TWO, and TOO
3102 2018-02-14 17:07:12 Oil drilling off NC is great, makes us self sufficient helps to lower trade I'm balance which benefits us all ... even ur kids. U have faulty arguments. Get over it already.
3103 2018-02-14 17:07:04 Oh, no! I've had some success with lavender oil, but I imagine lil baby is making things kind of uncomfortable. Good luck! 
3104 2018-02-14 17:07:02 WTI oil at $58.65/barrel, -$0.54.
3105 2018-02-14 17:06:56 Transfer payments are just welfare for other provinces. They don't want our oil our pipelines and the jobs that they would provide they don't need our money.

3112 2018-02-14 17:05:56 Wait you mean I got laid off in 2015 because of the gubmint and not because it costs $45 to produce a barrel of oil that was selling for $38?

Crazy.
3113 2018-02-14 17:05:55 I told the place I'm getting an oil change at that I'd be there in an hour.
45 minutes later I am still in a towel playing on my phone.
3114 2018-02-14 17:05:53 That would seem to be needed to create competitive,  export quality EVs. How much policy is aimed at cultivating the next big export good vs. cutting domestic emissions and oil imports?
3115 2018-02-14 17:05:53 Lol what!? You moron 9/11/01 was the date of 911, 12/30/06 was the date Saddam was killed. 911 and the false assumption that he had WMD's were the pretext for the war when it was actually about oil
3116 2018-02-14 17:05:27 You are totally missing my point. I'm not talking about just oil tankers, I'm talking ALL ship traffic. You are happy to protest something that doesn't affect the livelihood of BC residence, but won't protest anything that will cause you any pain.Hypocrites!
And our air is better
3117 2018-02-14 17:05:27 7 trillion invested in rebuilding the Middle East by the United States? Is anybody ever heard of the barter system? We need oil they need our 7 trillion. This ain't that hard folks
3118 2018-02-14 17:05:27 Sounds to me like he's scared to face the public! Eeek, scary travellers! They might not like me selling all our natural resources out to the oil industry! Hide me in first class!
3119 2018-02-14 17:05:22 The best oil, the most valuable oil on earth is the oil that stays in the ground.
3120 2018-02-14 17:05:07 Got the oil leaks on my 2007 #VW Rabbit fixed ... finally. If they truly found them all I'm now proud owner of only VW on planet that doesn't leak oil.
3121 2018-02-14 17:05:04 Very happy to see you use them. For yrs I have been buying their neem oil soap for use abroad. #sayNoToCamay kind we are.
3122 2018-02-14 17:05:03 For M/M ships in general, I love opposites attracting, contrasting personalities, rivals to friends to lovers, oil and water types.
3123 2018-02-14 17:04:58 Funny! But, I was thinking about the cousin who was killed with VX Nerve Agent, applied by 2 (unwitting?) young women sporting gloves ostensibly to avoid getting 'baby oil' on their hands.
3124 2018-02-14 17:04:55 Thanks for sharing Dave. So now China is dropping the USD peg for the golden peg. Oil priced in CNY next?

3129 2018-02-14 17:04:38 You can do one of two things: get a softer butter or keep the butter at a warmer temperature. Personally I really like Kerrygold butter for spreading on toast... Land-O-Lakes has a real butter that's mixed with canola oil so it is easier to spread; it comes in a tub and is great!

3133 2018-02-14 17:04:34 Removing restrictions open the lands for oil & gas research. NOT ALL LANDS have energy sources. There are natural restrictions  w environment.

3143 2018-02-14 17:03:04 "We have entered that era again." so a dark ages with overly religious zealots shove their snake oil and mysticism to make monies, for that I agree.
3144 2018-02-14 17:02:57 The Marxist government of California will not be able to stop the exploitation of the oil resources there and the thousands of well paying jobs it will bring to their economy. You go ahead and reject that from your place of privilege.

3148 2018-02-14 17:02:22 I doubt the US will allow the Kurds to export oil through Syria with revenue going to the Syrian govt.  Kurds will grow resentful towards control from outside.

3150 2018-02-14 17:02:19 If my limited geological skill is correct lime stone is created by animals death, their oil then trapped beneath them. As Illinois  is four hundred miles away more or less makes since to find it here and pipe it than from alaska. Anyone is welcome to test drill on my deposits.

3152 2018-02-14 17:02:06 We need a refinery to make that bitumen cleaner. The Conservatives should have made the oil companies more responsible during the good years then we wouldn't be in this sticky situation today.

3175 2018-02-14 17:00:07 I don't see gas prices rising if we continue producing our own oil. If the Fed is responsible and raises interests, inflation should not be horrid. The infrastructure package is structured to have private industry pay a great piece. If taxes go up, that's on Dems.

3186 2018-02-14 16:58:40 At the time, oil was a $3 trillion+ industry.

$25/barrel (w/out even counting effectively free feedstock & power) meant you could have reaped a few hundred billion in net profits.
3187 2018-02-14 16:58:38 Castor oil.
3188 2018-02-14 16:58:20 I mean oil stocks are plummeting over the long term while renewables are rising, so divestment is just a good decision economically. That darned free market!

3199 2018-02-14 16:57:29 Of course, you were probably only looking at similar, paltry potential profit margin in the 10s of billions of dollars in *natural* *gas* futures.

But a corporation w/sufficient resources & insight could have used that $25/barrel conversion rate of NG to oil.

3209 2018-02-14 16:56:33 I guess there is no loyalty to those without money. The oil industry gets loyalty from all political parties. But the people of Alberta? No loyalty. So I guess this is a lesson for us. No loyalty on our part either. Just strategic use of our political power to get results.

3246 2018-02-14 16:50:48 By the end of 2014, by which time you could have sold, oil was less than $54/barrel. Meaning each *penny* would have returned a net profit of over *$16.*

A net profit over *1600* times greater than your investment.

Don't know if shorting would have been legal based on what I knew, but for $0.01 you could have bought the right (not the obligation) to sell 100 barrels of oil for $70 each on 6/25/14 (2 days after I announced my tech via Twitter).

3291 2018-02-14 16:44:56 No, America is a tribalist country that keeps denying it. Black people hate white people, white people hate black people, natives hate outisiders and outsiders don’t like the natives. America isn’t a “cultural melting pot” unless the melting pot is mixing oil and water.

3331 2018-02-14 16:40:42 Lightning McQueen just apologized to Mater for calling so late and Mater said “shoot not for me it’s not, i’m always burning that midnight oil” omg lol I would not have gotten that when I was younger 
3332 2018-02-14 16:40:41 But is it an oil in the rubber feet? Or some other chemical reaction?
3333 2018-02-14 16:40:22 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
3334 2018-02-14 16:40:20 What begins? Selling hope and snake oil!? @Pirates are great at selling those two things!? Pathetic MLB organization.
3335 2018-02-14 16:40:18 Maybe some more Saudi aramco ipo posturing? Maybe another opec statement to buoy oil price soon? Definitely long term bear but closing out some shorts here

3340 2018-02-14 16:39:58 Marc Rose: “With oil prices strengthening, look for more M&A in the upstream space and more joint ventures among producers/gatherers. And look for Permian Basin activity to change in character from large land acquisitions to a focus on building out.” #SidleyEnergyOutlook

3344 2018-02-14 16:39:37 @tvcnewsng #JH everybody wants to make money coupled with oil in commercial quantity

Technology in foreign land is different with ours here
3345 2018-02-14 16:39:34 That's the problem; substituted the 33% less effective 2 in 1 oil for the 50% more effective 3 in 1 oil originally specified.
3346 2018-02-14 16:38:48 So, in the wake of the largest gamed market, Enforcement is dropping in headcount?  And there's even an issue with restoring 17 positions -this is like gutting the EPA to game OIL drilling.  We will pay for this cost...eventually! Burden now on private securities counsel.
3347 2018-02-14 16:38:27 Nigeria mono economy nature& over dependent on oil makes us a lazy nation. All states most imbibed improve IGR. Invest on Agriculture& Mineral resources.

3349 2018-02-14 16:38:13 Will take months.  Even have an environmental company coming to take core samples to see if oil and fuel has gone into the soil.
3350 2018-02-14 16:38:12 With all its oil wealth Iraq never needed aid. But of course those who claim to have liberated that country went ahead and plundered it.
3351 2018-02-14 16:38:09 If the CNY oil futures doesn't get up and running as planned, and, equally, doesn't thrive, there's no visible catalyst to act as a gold market "game changer." Save for those with an unlimited time horizon, the efficacy of "stacking" hangs in the balance.
3352 2018-02-14 16:38:04 Called to book an oil change for today at 6 and the guy at the dealership was like “no plans for Valentine’s Day, huh?” Just book my damn appointment, Randy.

3359 2018-02-14 16:36:50 On this day in 1998, an oil tanker train collided with a freight train in Yaoundé, Cameroon, spilling fuel oil. One person scavenging the oil created a massive explosion which killed 120.

3367 2018-02-14 16:36:09 'no control on strength or side effects of oil'...all these details need to be resolved prior to legalization. The Canadian Govt. is assuming wrongly that recreational users will only be SMOKING cannabis! Well! Think again! People are curious, after all!

Now someone has some travelling to do!!!
3373 2018-02-14 16:35:29 Hi, Deb! The Brain Octane oil alone has amazing benefits, but we highly suggest trying it with some grass-fed butter. The saturated fat in grass-fed butter slows the absorption of caffeine, which gives you even energy for several hours instead of a caffeine spike and crash.
3374 2018-02-14 16:35:18 I think inflation is underestimated. Just wait until cell phone broadband collapse pass-through effect diminishes and higher crude oil prices jump into the CPI calculation at the same time, I expect it around March
3375 2018-02-14 16:34:56 Se acuerdan en 2017 cuando el Oil estaba cayendo y llego a $42? ... ahora esta sub-$60.... Cuando este en $77 no se sorprendan

3380 2018-02-14 16:33:57 I have given the breakdown...in direct taxes and then in storage transport and handling. Oil Marketing companies are allowed only 12/- a liter in the entire supply chain.

3382 2018-02-14 16:33:45 Dream on. It is EVIL for the oil companies to make a dime but OKAY for the gubment to take $1.00

3389 2018-02-14 16:33:01 The priority now is to curb the unemployment in SA ! This has priority over any other measure. True we still heavily dependent on oil export but getting jobs won’t happen without raising the cost of the expats .
3390 2018-02-14 16:32:34 Oil prices rose on Wednesday, rebounding from earlier losses after U.S. crude stocks rose less than expected and Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said major oil producers would prefer tighter markets than to end supply cuts too early.

3392 2018-02-14 16:32:21 Since I live in Sweden and we have colder seasons that a lot of the world and I work with demolishing old oil tanks and heaters, I can say that no, we are not prepared to deal with stuff without secure electricity. When the old oil-based burner dies people panic, but that is
3393 2018-02-14 16:32:21 Oil change time 
3394 2018-02-14 16:32:18 Anyone who has stood on the Golan Heights is in little doubt why Israel doesn't want Syria to have this strategic position. Plus it is an essential watershed. But the oil could stay in the ground. Make it an international reserve. The water will still flow.

3401 2018-02-14 16:31:15 The monetary system. Destroying our resources on purpose just so they fit a commodity-evaluation model for distribution is planetary suicide. Not to mention that it continues to drive us to do crazy shit like continue global warming just so we can keep selling oil.

3409 2018-02-14 16:30:24 But there’s no oil! Overwhelmingly natural gas with a little bit of ethane and propane. The point stands about the drilling boom, of course—but the economics of gas wells aren’t nearly as attractive as for oil, so the extent of boom the next 3-5 years is uncertain.

3416 2018-02-14 16:30:08 As oil prices continue to climb, they are climbing, the cargoes getting loaded today will hit your pumps in about 20-30 days..you bet they will be higher. No politics..just business.

3419 2018-02-14 16:29:50 $FANG is expected a 12% oil cost increase for the full year in Midland and 17% in Delaware. "It's not happening in Q1 but if (oil) prices stay where it is, we anticipate that some of the service guys will start calling for (price) increases."
3420 2018-02-14 16:29:50 My greatest hope is that, with the (hopeful) downfall of the cabal, we start to see the technologies that have been hidden from us.

Happy Valentine's day to me 
3472 2018-02-14 16:24:19 Oil needs to dip back down. Fuel prices are huge to the little guys
3473 2018-02-14 16:24:17 Nah! @EPAScottPruitt can upgrade to business or 1st on his own dime. Tax payers shouldn’t have to pay for privilege, just so this jackass doesn’t get recognized & called out for destroying the planet & for his whoring out to big oil. Get your dumbass back in coach. GTFO!
3474 2018-02-14 16:24:14 @StateDept FYI: The mission of the State Department is different from the mission of an oil company. Reorganizing the State Dept in a way similar to how you would reorganize an oil company you take over won’t work.
3475 2018-02-14 16:24:13 マジっすか……今雑に調べたんですけどそれっていっぱい異形がでてくるやつです……？(わくわく)

3480 2018-02-14 16:22:58 Had an organic consultant tell one of my growers the only reason she had problems with weeds is because her soil isn't healthy. All she needed to do is spray fish oil and spread lime for soil amendments. If she did that for a couple of years she wouldn't have weeds anymore.

3483 2018-02-14 16:22:42 Would you expect anything less of California??
3484 2018-02-14 16:22:25 Oh Update:

I made a delicious pot of Sea food Okro... 

Palm oil stew also. 

But now, my bank account is crying 
3485 2018-02-14 16:22:20 So kind you are, supporting the weak team  best of luck! you are expecting oil money to beat the best club of football history 
3486 2018-02-14 16:22:09 Lucas Oil seems to have the market cornered on bikes and quads.
3487 2018-02-14 16:22:05 It’s all about the money... oil and gas.
3488 2018-02-14 16:21:56 Book finished. @peterjamesuk Card bought. Car oil bought. Wifey romantically ironing. Afternoon sleep. #halfterm
3489 2018-02-14 16:21:54 I thought u just got it waxed? That should get everything off; then oil for comfort, just ask for Dennis.
3490 2018-02-14 16:21:53 Normally - except famine or epidemy - I don’t buy spanish products as strawberries or tomatos or olive oil...quite cheap, but low quality and even “plastic flavour” 
I think don Mariano () will not get hungry for that. I’m just sincere.
3491 2018-02-14 16:21:23 Russia wouldn't even provide oil products to Syria without payment. The Syrian government situation is a lot more frail that it looks !
3492 2018-02-14 16:21:22 Changing my oil and the lobby is watching local news and some guy popped the question to his girl while she was in class (adults) and were all laughing because it’s so awkward lmao THE GIRL HESITATED AND DIDNT ANSWER WHEN HE POPPED IT

3495 2018-02-14 16:21:08 There were NO weapons of mass destruction. It's sad to say, we destroyed a middle class country at taxpayer expense. And created ISIS. For oil?
3496 2018-02-14 16:20:56 The best days are days when a 50 dollar oil changes turns into 700. I love being an adult.
3497 2018-02-14 16:20:54 I'm an oil change outside of 36,000 miles, and my Renegade's fan module is suddenly defective. Thanks, @Jeep #sarcasm
3498 2018-02-14 16:20:52 .@FERCRPowelson says during #bombcyclone New England burned 2 million barrels of oil to keep lights on. That’s not a good story- speaks to the work we can do together to bring new tech solutions @EventsESA

3506 2018-02-14 16:19:35 The city of Huntsville Alabama just put together a huge package that will turn a cotton field into a Toyota/Mazda factory.  Alabama in 5 years will have over 70,000 auto manufacturing jobs.  Up from zero 25 years ago. Incentives paid for by oil lease revenue royalties.
3507 2018-02-14 16:19:27 Ugh. I mixed in some peppermint oil but it didn't help. I've just started on turmeric capsules.

3519 2018-02-14 16:18:16 Slavery was “legal” Jim Crow “was legal” legality has nothing to do with morality it has to do with power and w VA lawmakers paid *handsomely* by oil lobbyists and companies. Legal corruption of politics.

3524 2018-02-14 16:17:18 I unironically agree with that. I would love a superhero polar bear that fights against oil executives and takes over Canada
3525 2018-02-14 16:17:14 Gah damn I’m tired of my $86 oil changes
3526 2018-02-14 16:17:12 Shouldn't even matter. They've been in the race all season long and have been doing it for some time now without anything resembling a #1 goalie. With that said, fully expect him to will them into the playoffs...which would make things even more ironic.
3527 2018-02-14 16:17:02 Medi Kingdom is now the largest medical cannabis producer in the Eastern Hemisphere, with plans to export cannabis flower, oil and products to all legal medicinal cannabis markets including Canada, Germany, UK and Australia

3547 2018-02-14 16:13:54 My background is BS in physics followed by a year in a physics PhD track program. I left grad school and worked as a geophysicist in oil & gas for 10 years, until I was layed off in 2016. I took the opportunity to reevaluate my career path & am pursuing data sciences!
3548 2018-02-14 16:13:54 This (induced oil consumption) is a legit concern.  One can calculate net emission reductions as a function of a range of oil displacement assumptions. The larger, longer-term CO2 impact comes from lower CCS costs and creation of a norm of capture at large sources.
3549 2018-02-14 16:13:42 This is why I don't tell people shit. Told my friend I'ma do an oil change on the car and all I get is condescending talk like I'ma fucking retarded and guna fuck the car more or let it fall on me.  I'm not fucking stupid. But thanks.

3562 2018-02-14 16:12:00 Yòu are unWare that oil now brings in relatively little money - certainly not in the billions. It’s only tax revenue that counts.
3563 2018-02-14 16:11:58 When your oil change costs as much as your cell phone bill 
3564 2018-02-14 16:11:50 One can only assume that it’s cannabis oil or some kind of essential oil, right?
3565 2018-02-14 16:11:45 News update. Vet says my ear infection is cured. All systems go.

3577 2018-02-14 16:09:16 Sorry don’t agree, wasn’t happy with the placing but makes sense in the longer term. 1 thing is for sure the oil price is a lot higher so makes sense to bring back the old wells and increase the %. Balcome and brockham will play a key part. Wytch farm started the same way #ANGS
3578 2018-02-14 16:09:10 Doesn’t it have any $$ from the sale of its oil which made billions for decades? Where is that money now?

3582 2018-02-14 16:08:52 Do you still consume oil( any oil)? I found that oil and fatty raw food ( like lots of nuts or too much avocado) still effects on my mood and health.
3583 2018-02-14 16:08:46 Agree Mal.

The costs would be astronomical just to travel on roads. They’d be sabotaging their own interests with Big Oil. People will travel less because they can’t afford it.
3584 2018-02-14 16:08:40 We are getting snake oil.
3585 2018-02-14 16:08:34 Picking up this point: Japan resisted conditionality for CCS (e.g. in OECD export credits) & has limited CO2 storage in the wrong location. Indonesia options are in oil & gas. No coal hotspot country in SE Asia has a credible CO2 storage plan. Coal industry prefers it that way.
3586 2018-02-14 16:08:24 My muscles are fcked up but I have no massaging oil. Guess who's going to sleep with talc all over her body?

3596 2018-02-14 16:06:43 @JustinTrudeau is more interested in a flawed & useless strategy to supposedly save the world by keeping fossil fuels in the ground. Meanwhile, countries around the world take advantage of his ideological gaffes to produce more oil & benefit their citizens. Canada - not so much.

This is not self pity - these are facts.    Regardless of the above, today will be great.

3624 2018-02-14 16:03:52 I agree. National oil is another cartel and cash cow. If national oil performed its role, why should we have a regulator in the name of ERC?

3627 2018-02-14 16:03:38 No problem! Rapeseed is just simple rubbish veg oil, like soybean, cottonseed etc. Best fats are olive oil, avocado oil, butter and lard. Although it’s best not to add much fat and cook in their own fat if possible.

3630 2018-02-14 16:03:10 Hi Wally! Toured a Canola crush plant a few years ago. At that facility they cleaned the canola seed and crushed it. After oil extraction, the meal had the screenings added back in. Then the meal mixture was heat extruded into pellets. The pellets are used in animal feed.

3636 2018-02-14 16:02:27 I think there were a lot of reasons: they ran at a loss, like most State-run industries; the discovery of North Sea gas and oil; the militancy of the mining unions; and the short-sightedness of Governments of both parties. No-one emerges with much glory here.

3681 2018-02-14 15:57:47 Suggestion: palm oil in food does not appear to dissolve or flow like an oil, rather it should be reclassified as a wax. This being Ash Wednesday, and the ashes being made of Palm Sunday palm fronds, it makes sense to get on this today.

3691 2018-02-14 15:56:55 I still can’t figure out how the Russians tangibly benefit from this nonsense. Chaos = economic chaos = economic recession = lower economic activity = lower oil usage = lower oil prices =  poorer Russian economy.

2) he named the currency CUC and then just died, very smooth. 
3) 1 CAD = 0.8 CUC

3841 2018-02-14 15:41:25 Oil and petroleum products have been shipped in and out of that port for 50+ years without an incident. To start exploring other options into uncharted territory can be very dangerous. This is the safest option, which is why NEB has approved it.

4023 2018-02-14 15:27:49 Girl just said she’s using oil normally used for “ethnic” hair. You must be “ethnic” then since you’re using it

4025 2018-02-14 15:27:46 I look at it moreso as Lucic wasn't having as good a year as many thought and isn't as awful as he has looked over the last 6-7 weeks.

Complexion gue jauh lebih cerah sejak gue pakai 5 hal ini:
1. Masker Freeman secara rutin 3x seminggu.
2. Almond oil setiap malam.
3. TIAM My Signature C Source tiap malam.
4. ACV sebagai toner setiap pagi.

...dan yang paling ngaruh

5. Mobil gantiin motor untuk ngantor.
4027 2018-02-14 15:27:45 Funny to see all the celebrities hawking platinum, oil, health services and other assorted stuff with their spouses this #ValentineDay . Get a life.
4028 2018-02-14 15:27:41 I’ll gladly take up that offer! Just give me a bit to stock up on beard oil and sneak onto the next plane heading for the west coast.
4029 2018-02-14 15:27:38 UK's entry: botox and plastic surgery. Ireland's entry: fake tan, fake tattoos and baby oil. #eurovision
4030 2018-02-14 15:27:31 I have thought from day one that Trump, Putin, Saudi’s and Tillerson have worked with each other to create a completely dominant oil cartel with the express goal of blackmailing the world economically and destroying other competing alternative energy sources sectors.
4031 2018-02-14 15:27:24 Well...this lady at work made chocolate covered apple slices...and for the chocolate she had to add a bit of coconut oil to make it smoother...I thought it wouldnt affect me and it didn't when I ate only one....but then I ate two more....

P.s. I’m highly alergic to coconut.
4032 2018-02-14 15:27:14 I have a hard time believing that any company (except maybe maybe small, values-driven ones) is going to care about D&I as a value because corporations and values tend to be like oil and water. Companies will never care inherently about D&I or any kind of justice.
4033 2018-02-14 15:27:03 Habitat restoration creates more jobs per $1M spent than oil/gas & transportation combined. Time to show some love for estuaries considering everything they do for us. #iheartestuaries @HouseAppropsGOP @AppropsDems @SenateApprops
4034 2018-02-14 15:27:02 I do that  I put coconut oil once a week. I thinkI need a trim it’s been like a year lmao
4035 2018-02-14 15:27:01 Totally agree. In this case, particularly, the joker is trying to mix oil with coconut water with his argument being the similar colour of the two liquids. What a diabolic twister of facts.

4044 2018-02-14 15:25:56 Lavender essential oil might help a bit. It won't interfere with your antidepressant. You can also try magnesium. Epsom salt baths would be the best way to go about getting that and relax you at the same time. Hope you feel better soon. Migraines are the worst!
4045 2018-02-14 15:25:50 I'm also not looking at this through a purely fundamental lens.  I believe we'll see societal push-back / abandonment as we have for big oil, fat cat banks, politicians, and pretty much everything else these days.  Not about the #'s per se.

4048 2018-02-14 15:25:28 You are talking opposite, it posted exception item which ate away its profits, but look at the revenue 8000% up QoQ and 200% up YoY. That is amazing. But it also posted big expense item oil Field Services expenses - Not sure what this is...probably market punished it for this

4064 2018-02-14 15:23:46 Countries develop on debt, especially after war. History is literally littered with examples of how postwar reconstruction or wealthy countries spurs on growth. Do we really have to cite examples. As it were, the KRG is in debt quite heavily to Turkey with limited oil resources.
4065 2018-02-14 15:23:37 That's how every Canadian I know (except one oil worker in Alberta ) says they feel about it. He has placed the US & neighbors in jeopardy

4082 2018-02-14 15:21:23 If I fry something in an oil that contains tallow or lard, the food absorbs some of that oil and some of that tallow/lard remains even if drained on paper towel. If I eat it, I am eating beef/pork.. #Lent #Fishfry
4083 2018-02-14 15:21:22 ... consumer to continue to propel economic growth.  If we combine weakening Retail Sales with slowing mortgage demand, and  falling oil prices, well that picture certainly does not suggest the Fed  ought to be overly concerned about inflation at the moment...

4104 2018-02-14 15:17:48 Oil production =\= US gas refining. We had a gas and oil explosion under Obama. He only sought to contain gas and oil exploration to Shale Plays on US lands. The US out producing Russia has been years in the making. Only time will tell if his tax plan has any longterm benefits.

4108 2018-02-14 15:17:08 A light machine oil probably helps lubricate the mechanism. If the blade is carbon steel, the oil will prevent corrosion as well.

I wouldn't trust CLP for this application, however.

4120 2018-02-14 15:15:42 I do a small squirt of castor oil, a larger squirt of jojoba (the castor can be drying -- but is REAL GOOD, so dilute in jojoba), and a drop of lavender + tea tree because I have them lying around.
4121 2018-02-14 15:15:36 Now why would a province so wealthy in oil, gas, coal and uranium, located north of the 49th parallel waste money on trying to be a renewable leader? I’m all for renewables between the tropics, and where other energy sources are scarce/expensive but in Sk it’s a fools errand.

4131 2018-02-14 15:14:52 Mark, I visited Venezuela in the 1980s, what a beautiful country, vast reserves of oil, coal, and all types of precious jewels.  I would think that Simon Bolivar is turning in his grave.  Socialism always leave their countries bankrupt eventually look at the UK in 1970s and 1990s

4139 2018-02-14 15:13:38 It's scary at first because OIL, but my face feels so happy now. It's been weeks since I started doing it. Google oil cleansing -- it's super granola, but worrrrrrrrks.

4142 2018-02-14 15:13:04 And every time I see that increase, I think of the oil companies and their buddies like Rex and trump filling their pockets.
4143 2018-02-14 15:13:04 I gotta get an oil change today. Should probably do that before CS2 releases

4145 2018-02-14 15:12:56 @everymanjack I've enjoyed using your beard oil for several months now. But it just went from $10 to $12 & because of that I will no longer.
4146 2018-02-14 15:12:48 Misted? That's sweet. I always use a little oil before a massage
4147 2018-02-14 15:12:39 I stopped using face wash, and just wash at night with castor oil and jojoba oil -- rub in for a couple minutes, hold hot wash cloth over face, then rinse. VOILA. Clean AND moisturized and amazing. My face stopped being so irritated and angry.
4148 2018-02-14 15:12:38 I made vegan pancakes too!  Plain white, whole-wheat with cinnamon, and white with vegan chocolate chunks.  All yummy.  No eggs, used applesauce instead. No butter just a little veg oil, and cashew milk.  Much enjoyed by the household vegan and rest of the fam.
4149 2018-02-14 15:12:38 i just put olbas oil on my nose and it’s stinging my eyes
4150 2018-02-14 15:12:36 guess my Dodge Dakota is the only 4x43 truck with a "belly Pan" protection plate or what ever that call it that bolts on under the frame to protect oil pan & such. Cant find the part or the bolts
4151 2018-02-14 15:12:36 I wish castor oil didn't smell like death and destruction.

4154 2018-02-14 15:11:36 During my youth in the hills of Kentucky, we were poor and got the government cheese and peanut butter. I liked the cheese,  but that peanut butter is why I can't even look at natural peanut butter, oil floating on top. Waste happens when you can't buy things people won't eat.

4157 2018-02-14 15:11:23 That'll be all that oil 
4158 2018-02-14 15:11:17 Can you give us a comparison of AB/fed marginal taxes on oil to Norway?

4160 2018-02-14 15:11:07 Wholesale costs on oil have been in freefall, yet some retailers have not even made a cut to petrol/diesel while others have only snipped 2p off at best. Drivers are being mugged... #fuel #ripoff

4163 2018-02-14 15:10:51 Dont start with some bull shit about male vs female crap, I dont care what you associate as or what back ground u are from. Im not blaming you for being female, Im saying your facts on federal trades deals are incorrect, as well, our country produces the cleanest oil in the world

4178 2018-02-14 15:09:07 Well I have to constantly stay in communication on my job. I work on a rig in the oil field. Difference is I don't make excuses and ask for pitty when I get sick.  I show up and do my job because people count on me.
4179 2018-02-14 15:09:05 Buy low, sell high??  It's called profits.

4183 2018-02-14 15:08:34 I have only stated Iran's position 
Iran only got their money back from USA that was blocked due to years of sanctions 
Iran sells millions of dollars worth oil every month - some of the money gets routed through American exchange system
USA is broke it has 21 trillion $ debt

4195 2018-02-14 15:07:02 I think it has to do with TCPL still operating under capacity and also increased demand in U.S. for heavy oil for blending especially w/ Venezuela on the skids.
4196 2018-02-14 15:06:58 This hearing had two cameras--one on the person speaking and one that was pointed at the committee and chair. Shott is just using that lie to smear her and take the attention off his big oil donors. I think Lissa had NO idea it would hit the internet.
4197 2018-02-14 15:06:58 Saddam don't care about religion lol not in the damn slightest. He mouthed off to Bush and we as a greedy country needed oil, seen an opportunity and took it. ISIS brought the religion not us.
4198 2018-02-14 15:06:54 Curious: besides oil revenues, what bad things? Also, good for you--Norway is one of my favorite places I've visited. Hope ya had a good trip.
4199 2018-02-14 15:06:52 History may not repeat until it's too late. This time oil prices may not fall until a Buick is traded for a glass of water. The true cost of fracked oil is not represented by the market price.
4200 2018-02-14 15:06:50 Not enough, if we progress like this 50℅ of Sindhu people will be living in sea oats like Refugees. Why can't we leave the carbon in Earth alone. What moronic hyptonism & myopic vision are we suffering from that we can't leave oil? Whole species is under threat but no 1 awake

4237 2018-02-14 15:02:03  None of you have done your research. That’s clear. Look up enzymes, protein, and vitamins and at what temp they are denatured or broken down. Then look at pasteurization temps. Also, cooking with the wrong oil at high temps make it rancid. Is that easy enough for you?
4238 2018-02-14 15:01:35 Our oil sands are more carbon intensive to produce & yield higher petroleum coke than the crudes we are competing with So from a carbon perspective there is a difference. Also Alberta is 40% of national emissions, it does make a difference if we really mean to hit Paris target
4239 2018-02-14 15:01:24 I hate to be a Grinch but the Dairy Queen Valentine cake has PALM OIL in it. PLEASE read your labels for palm oil like we didn't. That shit is in EVERYTHING!

4241 2018-02-14 15:01:12 Those are states?  Here I thought those were independent countries. A realistic compare would be -- does all of the single country of Norway share their resource wealth or only the lucky parts to live above the Oil?

4298 2018-02-14 14:55:21 Not terribly practical, but a godsend nonetheless: if you can add spices to whatever food you donate, please do. When you can't afford anything other than salt, you use too much of it.

4305 2018-02-14 14:54:11 Sustainable palm oil – or ‘no deforestation palm oil’ – is produced in a socially and environmentally responsible way. Keep an eye out for the RSPO label on a product, which certifies that something contains #sustainable #palmoil #orangutans #sumatra

4325 2018-02-14 14:51:55 "Aid work doesn’t just attract those with a desire to do good, but those who get off on blood, gore and drama." Not just those: the overseas oil industry, for example, is rife with sex tourists masquerading as engineers.

They key to crippling Big Pharma is to cripple everything in the DC Fed Gov but military & law enforcement. Return gov to local & state gov’s.

4332 2018-02-14 14:50:39 Our warranty department uses the “severe conditions” maintenance schedule, this applies to all of Canada as weather conditions can cause greater stress on the vehicle. Accordingly the oil changes should be done every 6,000km or 6 months, whichever occurs first.

4345 2018-02-14 14:49:20 A lot cheaper. So is gas. Just like with the warranty being kilometers vs miles. Gas here is in liters vs gallons. Canadians pay way more for gas. As well as furnace oil.

4390 2018-02-14 14:45:23 Corporate controlled America doesn't want Iran's oil but, only in one sense. The U.S. wants Iran's oil off of the market which makes the current oil oligopoly's holdings more valuable--The U.S. doesn't want Iran's oil.

4394 2018-02-14 14:45:04 Tea Tree is a strong oil for sure, but as long as you have 100% true oils it's okay, animals aren't going to be drinking it or eating it and diffusing it would be fine.  There's a lot of better resources to look into about it plus I wouldn't trust any oils from the grocery store

4459 2018-02-14 14:36:48 In a choice between a symbiotic exchange between clean, peaceable energy - cryptocurrency and toxic, blood stained gold - oil, I know what I'd choose, but I know what elites would choose!

But why must packaging be plastic? Some sort of oil company plot

4464 2018-02-14 14:35:59 But it's also that the belief spreads to other places like oil change service centers always have CNN on while you wait. How'd that became the safe channel to have on and why do we need tvs everywhere anyway? What every happened to simply talking to each other while we wait?

4571 2018-02-14 14:24:17 How is oil transported from the US to Vancouver? Through rainbows? Transporting from the port is the safest option, BC has no one to blame but themselves if a spill happens.

4584 2018-02-14 14:23:12 My theory is they were actually trying to help Clinton win. Why would they want tromp when they know Trump was for producing more oil that would hurt their economy terribly and Clinton made a good deal with them with the uranium they love her

4587 2018-02-14 14:22:52 @ShelaghFogarty Yes 29% future prediction. Not always accurately as oil prices can cause fluctuations for inflationary pressures, or not! But I saw a 1% overlap that worried me.  Govt not OTT on worry. They’ve slowed car imports I’m sensing. Homes may not increase in value now.
4588 2018-02-14 14:22:47 The dollar surged on this morning's inflation data and the bulk of the dollar-denominated commodities immediately came under pressure, including crude oil and the grain complex. The dollar has eased back from its highs during the AM pause in the grain trade. #OATT

I will make over $100k this year, most of it will come from my real estate. My passive income is greater than my expenses.

4616 2018-02-14 14:19:20 You are right......and inflation is very much tied into oil prices.....have always believed that US needs to greatly reduce oil consumption for a variety of reasons....including the economic ones....and very much the pollution reasons.....

4639 2018-02-14 14:16:06 Moreover, if low oil prices will not allow their central gov. that collects all the taxes to send enough money to the regions then the history of 1991 may repeat itself.

4645 2018-02-14 14:14:45 Hey @grazedotcom the fact your products are packed with Palm Oil doesn’t really fit your goodie goodie sustainable image does it now? What about the the rainforest and the orangutans!?
4646 2018-02-14 14:14:35 As ever the oil companies maximise profit. Petrol prices rise like a rocket, fall like a feather.
4647 2018-02-14 14:14:34 You think you have it so bad but you have no idea what the average man has to do. I know 4 men who died working the oil fields trying to make money for their families to have a better life. But you have it worse right. The ones that really have it worse are girls under Sharia law

Between 2010-2015 (May), GEJ earned $445,000,000,000 from crude oil sales yet borrowed $2,000,000,000 to pay workers salaries.

4680 2018-02-14 14:10:09 How does inflation go up if Retail sales were down. Inflation is supply and demand. Oil down $6.00 since early January.  CPI numbers cooked?

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices averaged $51/b in 2017, up $7/b from the 2016 average, and ended the year $6/b higher than at the end of 2016

4817 2018-02-14 13:51:44 Agreed, but still if it is rising, it adds to inflation. We now sell to world market too so WTI close to Brent price. Our increased production will put a lid on how high it can go up. Opec would not hesitate to have $140/barrel oil again if it was in drivers seat.

4895 2018-02-14 13:39:49 I’ve been there.  Bit eggs are actually over 2 dollars and oil out of reach at around 4. What did we eat? Boxed Mac and cheese, ramen noodles. 70 cent hot dogs. Desperate for toiletries. And yes, you could get soda at 711 but not a rotisserie chicken
4896 2018-02-14 13:39:40 Oil will be a buy soon

4898 2018-02-14 13:39:29 Budget is based on $44 and oil has been consistently higher since they had it written up. Debts covered the deficit and aren't repaid all at once, hence the existence of a surplus. Commonplace for nations to be simultaneously in debt and in a surplus.

4905 2018-02-14 13:38:40 No, it's the oil revenue. Equalization is based on a province's capacity to raise revenue, not the actual revenue itself. A province can't game the system by artificially lowering taxes to get on equalization. And raising taxes won't take off a province off equalization.

5125 2018-02-14 13:08:58 No it wouldn’t, however, the differential wouldn’t be as large as it is now. Also there is much more to Alberta’s oil production than bitumen. High quality oil production is also suffering from the lack of price competition more markets would bring.

5290 2018-02-14 12:47:15 I`m all for reducing plastic consumption and recycling more but this statement is too simplistic. You could say the same for oil, gas , air travel , mobile phones , imported foods etc.
5291 2018-02-14 12:47:06 The United States does not care about the Rif; no US interests and no oil to be concerned about there! American values are mere fantasies...

5314 2018-02-14 12:44:05 I want @MBuhari to be kicked out just the way Jacob ZUma has been sent packing. From my evaluation, we have been taken backwards. There is general inflation and scarcity of petrol in the midst of crude oil that we are meant to refine.

Its the oil that still ensures Nigeria is one. Thats why the Northern hegemonist will stop at nothing to ensure that this contraption called Nigeria isnt restructured.

5324 2018-02-14 12:42:09 That’s fine ..the fact still remains that shale turned the oil world upside down and destroyed SA’s stranglehold. Permanently.
5325 2018-02-14 12:42:04 This agenda was carved out by globalists and goes against the interests of Canada. 

Canada is the third richest holder of proven oil reserves. I dont see Saudi Arabia or any other oil rich nation lining up with this plan.

5333 2018-02-14 12:40:24 idea: short gold
what is supporting gold is real rate compression due to higher inflation expec. rising faster than nominals & DXY wkns. 
the later is stretched, the former could reverse today + oil falling down will kill inf expec BUT Nominals might not reverse due to QT

$1.3 billion

The amount a top oil executive paid for one of Africa’s biggest untapped oil discoveries. The question of whether the payment was mostly a bribe is at the heart of one of the biggest scandals in the oil industry.
5436 2018-02-14 12:29:26 No, he's not tackled that one yet. And now he' trying to squirm out of his "£16bn exports" claim to by saying the oil was consumed in England....

5444 2018-02-14 12:27:26 If you check the ingredients of the Biglots peanut butter, I'll bet you'll find they include added vegetable oil and sugar, which help to make it taste good. Plain peanut butter without added oil and sugar doesn't taste as good. Commercial pb is engineered to promote consumption.

Guys,the oil fields in eastern Syria isn't huge,it produced once some 200,000 barrels/day from a total 580,000 from top Syrian production mid 90s.Pre war production was 380,000 & declining.About 150,000 is under Syria's.The key is gas & 90% is under Syria.

5457 2018-02-14 12:26:25 This is not  accurate. Firstly there are no signs from Venezuela re any invasion. Secondly despite the controversy Guyana has had generally good relations with its neighbor including an oil for rice agreement. 3. Brazil is unlikely to take sides especially militarily.

6111 2018-02-14 10:20:38 This looks like there may be remnants from the previous burn that's obviously got into this soup batch. If needed add a little more oil or put the liquid in first and then your produce. Might be a case of trial and error. Chantelle

6189 2018-02-14 10:06:53 To be “proved” (in sec definition) it must be drilled within 5 years.  Most shale oil wells are a lot further out.  More Saudi oil will be produced from existing wellbores.

6192 2018-02-14 10:06:21 Following the oil pollution in the River Kennet at Marlborough yesterday, we'd like to thank Thames Water for their work to minimise its impact and trace the source. It's a stark reminder that 'washing away' an oil spill just pushes it into the river. Only rain down the drain!

6206 2018-02-14 10:04:47 Sweet! Also reducing plastic is a domino effect, puts less pressure on oil and other sectors to making them & delivery. Reducing transport, drivers smoking less traffic, materials for machinery, injuries. Thanks to HRH.
6207 2018-02-14 10:04:34 Oily skin tends to over produce oil if its not got enough moisture, so moisturiser counteracts that. That's my issue, and I'm still finding the balance there.
6208 2018-02-14 10:04:31 When oil goes down USD/CAD goes up - correlation.Crude Oil tends to gain with the Canadian dollar. Canadian Dollar is positively related to crude oil prices due to crude's big share in Canada's FX currency earnings. So watch the Inventories later. Hope I've explained ok? @chigrl

6211 2018-02-14 10:03:51 @FoxNews & @CNN will work together to call out Assad, even though we all know why this is all still happening. Deep State can't handle that they lost & secondly maybe most importantly they want the oil & gas pipelines.Russia & Turkey have also made a deal. Special interests.

6295 2018-02-14 09:43:38 If we’re simply evaluating health-value of these fats/oils, then I see no reason not to include red palm oil alongside coconut oil. The only problem is that it’s a PR problem, and it has a very strong flavor.

6419 2018-02-14 09:17:06 However, in oil reservoirs, associated natural gas sometimes occurs in solution (like coke or sprite - in which case they’re called ‘undersaturated’) or as a Gas Cap (remember gas & oil don’t mix and have different densities).

6439 2018-02-14 09:13:00 Exactly. Too many people resent wealth because of jealousy, without stopping to think, or even care, if it was honestly gained and maybe even being used to help others, grow business, fund jobs, build for the future. They should identify and focus on the snake oil salesmen.

6521 2018-02-14 08:57:25 According to the FT: "Norway’s $1 trillion oil fund voted against pay proposals at Alphabet, JP Morgan and Volkswagen last year as it stepped up its fight against excessive and complex executive remuneration."
6522 2018-02-14 08:56:59 4.1 EXXON is allowed to cover cost from a set percentage of the oil- the figure is the same as in Gabon, Ghana (75%), lower than Trinidad (80%), slightly higher than Suriname (70%) . So its untrue that Coleman's statement is misleading at best.

6569 2018-02-14 08:48:53 Heck even $2 from a million of us and they have more money than the oil corp Candidates.

6584 2018-02-14 08:45:46 Blend 4 1/2 tbsps haiku roll with 8 oz bamboo shoots. Add Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve a la mode
6585 2018-02-14 08:45:40 By most accounts it will be due its first oil change well before it hits the asteroid belt #5000kmservice
6586 2018-02-14 08:45:31 4. 'Coleman notes that before Guyana profits from its own oil, Exxon Mobil must first recoup its investment, a process that could take as long as a decade' this is not only inaccurate by show a lack of understanding about contracting, Guyana receives 50% of profit oil from day 1
6587 2018-02-14 08:45:11 While I don't disagree w/ the disdain  many have shown towards the work of the officials in most Oilers games, with the way this season has gone, it's not exactly the best of looks. Again, it may be warranted to a degree but still...
6588 2018-02-14 08:44:43 It will be due for a wheel alignment and oil change by then

6598 2018-02-14 08:43:11 *siapin olive oil
6599 2018-02-14 08:42:52 Thanks. Got some early this morning at Forte Oil, Fadeyi
6600 2018-02-14 08:42:39 yup and a glass of cod liver oil to wash it all down
6601 2018-02-14 08:42:33 This is what all this bullshit is about .you think if we give tillerson, putin and trump the way to drill for there oil they will leave the country.let them make all the money they want in Russia
6602 2018-02-14 08:42:20 There is no such thing.

All land has a water table beneath it, and all chemicals leach away into watersheds.  Do you believe they will really clean it up, or just go bankrupt? Oil is unprofitable.

A spilled gallon of petrochemicals can contaminate a homeowners’ well.

6603 2018-02-14 08:42:16 Loool is it that bad? Maybe some cod liver oil will help with your joints?
6604 2018-02-14 08:42:00 Have oil companies committed crimes when there are massive oil leaks that pollute people's drinking water?

6609 2018-02-14 08:40:56 Rubbing grapeseed oil into someone for an hour does wonders for your hands. First time they've been soft all winter. Wife heartily endorses this self-care.

6618 2018-02-14 08:39:06 made annatto infused oil so I can have the good red rice and maybe get this recipe/technique closer to how my stepmom's tastes
6619 2018-02-14 08:38:34 just my opinion. mineral oil sgt berkesan dlm pembersihan lagi2 dlm cleansing oil product. mungkin ia terlalu kuat or stripping your natural oils sebab tu jadi makin kering and leads to breakout. clog pores if awak guna pure mineral oil
6620 2018-02-14 08:38:28 Why is it that some people can't see that maybe the player's are the one's winning us game's not, as you say, oil? Can I ask, are you a City fan?

6623 2018-02-14 08:37:56 @alexrobertross If Jimmy vapes for nicotine, the liquid is not oil but e-liquid. PG, VG, flavorings and nicotine or not. If he vapes cannabis liquid then it may be called oil or hash oil I think.  #vaping #abillionlives #casaa
6624 2018-02-14 08:37:51 nah for my unless they fresh off the oil I ain't eating them
6625 2018-02-14 08:37:40 why are we obsessing about exporting dirty expensive oil sands for someone else to refine and make the bulk of profits on? how does that secure our own energy needs or secure our wealth? we need our own refineries and then that gas sold to canadians only!

6631 2018-02-14 08:35:42 he doesn't need to. The oil pipe he is laying across sacred first nations territory (without permission) in BC will make lots. 

I don't think they will see a penny though
6632 2018-02-14 08:35:37 That’s great thinking. Remember when we were told that the price of fuel had to increase to over £1 because oil was costing $100 a barrel?
6633 2018-02-14 08:34:42 Okay. Whatever you say. But I think I'll pass on the "sugar, corn syrup, brown sugar syrup, corn starch, barley malt extract and CANOLA oil (aka poison).

6639 2018-02-14 08:33:28 OPEC has been cutting production to stabilize Crude prices but surging US oil production could soon equal global demand growth which will inevitably affect oil prices. Today’s EIA report will probably move WTI and Brent prices.

Restricting #dilbit to developed North American continent maximizes chance of charging true liabilities & adding value.

7271 2018-02-14 06:25:02 The problem to take action on climate change is the obvious example. Political systems operate much slower than economic/financial systems which just keep on burning oil, essentially. The information is there, but it's not being made use of.
7272 2018-02-14 06:24:47 Ignorant folks that don’t understand oil and gas drilling or completions Stupid is as Stupid does

7275 2018-02-14 06:24:38 The phrase "oil ur walls" seems better than getting a turn up its more like rubbing 'Lotion' on ur neck. #soothingbutdifferent.
7276 2018-02-14 06:24:14 I see the Democrats have finally found time to rage against oil, but are pushing wind, as fishermen are against both. You don't suppose they recognize the hypocrisy/betrayal?
7277 2018-02-14 06:24:13 Starbucks d/n have to store bikes at night, regulars get cheap commute (& buy coffee), tourists are bread and butter (& buy coffee). Maintenance (tires, chain oil) added by commuters.

7279 2018-02-14 06:24:07 But Ahmet Turkey’s own MIT was caught with trucks loaded with arms for Daesh by your Turkish police. Similarly Turkey traded oil from Daesh. If a country accepts helping terrorists for strategic aims then it cannot blame others for doing exactly the same.
7280 2018-02-14 06:24:05 Pour one pinches of olive oil then allow to simmer.
7281 2018-02-14 06:23:12 the opportunity exists, these third world nations are sitting on bastions of natural resources with a crap ton of unutilized human productivity. south africas diamond is another example. im sure the majority of the african continent is a giant oil reserve just waiting.
7282 2018-02-14 06:23:05 I used the default brush settings for the oil based brushes :)

7286 2018-02-14 06:22:18 Ha- ha! Oil prices came down. Reserves were used earlier by chavistas.

7294 2018-02-14 06:20:56 Ha- ha! Oil prices came down. Reserves were used earlier by chavistas. Why USA? Chavistas though, oil prices be hi forever.
7295 2018-02-14 06:20:44 How about some facts vs a guess.  When you drill a new well you need to get the natural gas / oil to market i.e. typically to an existing pipeline.

7297 2018-02-14 06:19:43 Batteries are the Devil’s work, & dwarfed by his work with OIL. Land contamination, huge subsidised cost to extract it, process it, ship it, pump it, only 25% efficient when we burn it. Air pollution, wars, global warming, price cartels..

7304 2018-02-14 06:17:51 I use coconut oil. Changed my life lol
7305 2018-02-14 06:17:41 One that helps control oil is the becca primer or the makeup forever primer but only use in the spots where you get oily. Right now I can't think of the exact name but if you go into sephora and ask about those brands and whatprimers are ok for oily skin u should find it.
7306 2018-02-14 06:17:40 Same rake checked at JKPR by optg staff , but not found any leakage. Now train is at KGP and C&W Staff booked for further checking for find out any oil leakage.

7311 2018-02-14 06:16:26 Trump is big fat lying child.  The republicans say tax helping for middle class BS. Now they are trying to raise oil and gas costs.  The 1% of the people are so rich so don’t care because they make more

7315 2018-02-14 06:16:09 It's a white people thing. My wife and I revealed our daughter's gender by burning 25 gallons of crude oil.
7316 2018-02-14 06:16:00 Sometimes you gotta go through the pieces, a little oil here, a little polish there, maybe blow the dust off.
7317 2018-02-14 06:15:59 The Russians aren't interested in starting ww3.

These were mercenaries hired by Assad to secure oil fields.

7319 2018-02-14 06:15:31 Y’all want a great face moisturizer. Jojoba oil. It’s the only oil that’s most similar to our skins natural oil.
7320 2018-02-14 06:14:56 Nah, we need oil.
7321 2018-02-14 06:14:52 I sometimes think Erdogan is part of a US/NATO plan to destroy Syria & Iraq to seize their oil. Trump mentioned in a pre-election speech that "he wanted to seize their oil".Erdogan has committed genocide in SE Turkey & mass destruction of property while the US & NATO said NOTHING
7322 2018-02-14 06:14:46 @Winstonind I work at a place I have to leave nameless and we have an oil filter machine but can't find our manual and need to fix it. Great machine just needs tune up. Please DM me. Thank you

7343 2018-02-14 06:10:43 More to it than just an oil spill. Incl. damage to marine mammals from noise pollution from 700% increase in tanker traffic; ship strikes to marine mammals & an increase to global warming through emissions from refining the oil elsewhere in the world. With this plan, we all lose.

7348 2018-02-14 06:09:12 Very human perspective on why not to sweat oil spills in variety of environments. Don’t worry, be happy. Sunny ways. Missing in language is why we are having conversation @ all. Other nations carry burden of mitigating climate change, Cnd abdicating it’s. Be happy, keep drilling.

7385 2018-02-14 06:02:45 Are you referring to the numerous different empires to control Persia as a continuous monarchy? Seriously? Also a parliament that voted to nationalize the British oil company controlling Iranian oil which we the prevented. "The leader was brutal but". Great endorsement.

7391 2018-02-14 06:01:18 Tar sands oil is thicker and more acidic than lighter conventional crude; this ups the likelihood that a pipeline carrying it will leak.
Complicating matters, leaks can be difficult to detect. 
When the oil does spill, it is far more detrimental to sensitive water resources.

7418 2018-02-14 05:54:49 Actually, getting a better price for the oil we already produce would be a great start. Oil sands production from Alberta already has a hard cap on it. Our oil is being sold at a severe discount to the US because it’s landlocked. We need options for other markets.
7419 2018-02-14 05:54:17 I wanna do oil paints but fuck me why is everything so EXPENSIVE
7420 2018-02-14 05:54:13 Not coincidentally, Jack Mintz is also on the board of directors of Imperial Oil. Nothing like using the pseudoscience of economics to lobby for your industry agenda.

I said "Try thorium."

I don't condone oil rigs.
7424 2018-02-14 05:53:22 Norway learned from Canada; we had PetroCan & Alberta had the Heritage Fund. 

Norway chose to tax oil companies heavily & put the money into their fund. Alberta chose tax cuts over investing. 

Now Norway has money in the bank & Alberta is broke. I wonder why?
7425 2018-02-14 05:53:10 I've represented a ton of guys who have fallen off trucks, oil rigs, scaffolds, etc. Some get black eyes. Not one has ever had that kind of black eye. Falls cause cuts. Busted bridge of nose. Bruising lower on face.

7430 2018-02-14 05:52:30 the worlds population has generally increased, and we had a huge oil boom since 2007. How can you guys compare Saskatchewans situation now to our situation 11 years ago and assume that and NDP government would immediately ruin all of it?

7434 2018-02-14 05:52:24 Inside the Bribery Scandal Sweeping Through the Oil Industry

Shell and Eni paid $1.3 billion for oil rights in Nigeria. Whether the money was mostly a bribe is at the heart of one of the industry’s most dramatic criminal cases

Obj, GEJ & PDP have lots of explanation 2 make.
7435 2018-02-14 05:52:04 And with oil only at $60/barrel. Curious how this compares to $100 days.
7436 2018-02-14 05:52:03 China and Russia are allied. China is most definitely part of the Russia Investigation. They’ve done a much better job of keeping their hands clean in the press,but they have stood to gain A LOT from this presidency. #TPP, Yuan currency for oil, control of S Korea and peninsula

7451 2018-02-14 05:49:25 It's time to invest in clean energy like many other countries already have. As far as the pipelines are concerned there would not be enough income for B.C. to take this risk. Also not that many jobs. Who do you think would end up paying for a major oil spill? Not Alberta

7483 2018-02-14 05:42:32 This recent fuel increase reeks of corruption! The reasons put across such as the depreciation of the Kwacha are blatant untruths. I wonder if the increase is not connected to the recent pronouncement encouraging people to “eat”, and the Findlay debut on the Oil supply scene.

7494 2018-02-14 05:40:05 But Norway is not trying to kill its own oil industry as the Liberals are doing for Canada. Norway has got the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world and it’s because of oil revenues. And it continues to grow. Norway is climate conscious but not stupid.

7503 2018-02-14 05:38:52 They can't ignore oil, but they are doing an excellent job on other fronts. For example, after YEARS of talk, Calgary has a new cancer centre under construction. The NDP just said, let's do it. What better time than when things aren't booming.

7518 2018-02-14 05:36:33 China and India have the most aggressive EV plans in the world. 65% of oil production goes to vehicles. Already 2% of new vehicles world wide are EVs - I think China hit 5% last year.

The EV trend will tank prices and the remaining demand will be easily met by cheaper sources.

7553 2018-02-14 05:30:20 I love how my face feels after I wash it and put coconut oil before I go to sleep.
7554 2018-02-14 05:30:15 so i had my hand in my hair and i felt something and pulled it out and it was a little clear bead and i was freakin out cause i thought it was like a bug egg or something but then i squished it and it burst and it was like an oil bead from body wash. i’m relieved to say the least
7555 2018-02-14 05:30:08 Here is a case where the US Government itself is undermining the efficiency of the US $ which is the #1 currency for global trade. In monetary economic terms that is a huge warning for the @federalreserve

Next countries could enter oil for food programs

7561 2018-02-14 05:28:55 YUUSSS!

Although I kinda prefer coconut oil over Crisco. No polyunsaturates and smells wonderful!
7562 2018-02-14 05:28:36 Another Liberal by the name of Obama squashed it. It was a political move. Buffett owns the railways that ship the oil by rail tanker, & stood to loose $millions if the pipeline went through, so Obama & Libs also stood to loose financial support from Buffett, so ...political!
7563 2018-02-14 05:28:29 I won't lend any credence to Ezra on anything; oil and gasoline mkts in EastrnCan and US East Coast are very different from mkts in US Gulf Coast and NA West Coast. Are you unaware there's no pipeline from Alberta to Toronto Mtl and Irving-dom'd Maritimes? That's why @TransMtn...
7564 2018-02-14 05:28:17 You knew what you were doing when you tweeted it. It’s laughable that you’re trying to act like it was a perfectly innocent tweet. You were trying to get a reaction from City fans and pats on the back from others who hate City’s “oil money. Congrats on the successful tweet though

7588 2018-02-14 05:24:08 i know ! the wetness could probably last months if i wouldnt use turpentine or linseed oil mediums!!  and for sure, ive been into floral aesthetics for a while, so itll probably be flowers or mayb fungus
7589 2018-02-14 05:24:06 Not true, Iraq had the product but no understanding of how to export, until US involvement which has resulted the growth of oil companies involved. I do agree about the worth of the dollar though, as it’s been shown that the federal reserve can just pump out money when needed.

7617 2018-02-14 05:18:49 So the USA, about to become the world’s largest oil exporter, are exporting all this new oil to... nowhere? Because no one wants it? Uh huh. Where do you get YOUR news from?
7618 2018-02-14 05:18:26 I just got in my sage and thyme oils for hair and beard care this should be fun. Also sage essential oil smells amazing!!
7619 2018-02-14 05:18:26 "Oil stocks" is a big category. It's a large E&P. It's direct competitors are Pioneer, Apache, Anadarko, EOG. They've all sold off.

7627 2018-02-14 05:16:07 Nothing better than spending 3 hours in organic lab to steam distill an essential oil and running the IR spectrometer all to find out you yielded no product :’)
7628 2018-02-14 05:15:32 It was about having the control, and essentially we did buy revamping Iraq’s involvement in the oil industry which is controlled by American Companies.

7631 2018-02-14 05:14:41 The car is lacking engine oil, but basically the crankshafts are failing . It normally needs replacement
7632 2018-02-14 05:14:32 when it comes to oil production, what the US has managed to do this past decade is remarkable, a 'FED-induced' low-cost market share gains record to be proud of; but the long run will tell if oil independence is even possible, furthermore, if new oil operations will stay afloat.

7656 2018-02-14 05:10:57 Thanks Norm that's an interesting link but don't you think it's wildly optimistic for such rapid growth in EVs and A-EVs? Maybe in Cali and Fla but not tween PGeo and PRupt. And latest forecast says global demand for oil will keep GROWING at least 30 more years even w China cuts.

7662 2018-02-14 05:09:59 Meanwhile he's also arming rebels in Ukraine, bombing the Syrian military/government over and over, continuing a NATO troop buildup on Russia's border, threatening war with Iran, and blocking oil deals that Russia wants. So no, his foreign policy is aggressively anti-Russia.

7665 2018-02-14 05:09:37 Not sure why a car that passed me while pulled over on the side of the highway earlier felt the need to blow his horn repeatedly as he drove past at an obnoxious speed. My oil light came on & I felt that was something I had to deal with immediately. My hazard lights were on. 
7666 2018-02-14 05:09:23 @realDonaldTrump.  The United States of América must impose an immediate blockade and stop purchasing oil from Venezuela. The proceeds are fueling Maduro’s dictatorship. A blockade will suffocate his evil scheme and help stop this genocide
7667 2018-02-14 05:09:23 Don't have to smoke it. Buy a Health Canada approved vaporizer like the volcano or oil on your burger.
7668 2018-02-14 05:09:17 Of course, his history is aggressively nasty and wholly-owned by oil interests--in a more fiscally-responsible administration, he wouldn't have a role because it's too expensive to protect an asshole who's deliberately made so many enemies.

They protested & humiliated previous govt on rising prices, which are at peak now but nobody is talking about that. shocked to hear petrol price of 75 & diesel 65 per ltr. Crude oil was at bottom low during this govt, still they didn't pass any benefit. Frustrating

7727 2018-02-14 04:59:43 Do you remember what the price of oil and gas was in the 90? Then tell me what happened while balancing the budget was not a well managed system. 16 dollar oil and 60 cent natural gas was the norm not the exception

7747 2018-02-14 04:57:39 But what gets missed there is some dialogue that acknowledges that Norwegians had the choice and actively decided to not use oil revenue as a general income.  They had to keep taxes high in the early and mid 90s to keep things up, but now they're laughing.

7779 2018-02-14 04:52:37 I agree with what you say about not building infrastructure that'll become irrelevant, that's why we're not building refineries. But you're saying oil will be irrelevant in 10 years? No, Asia will be burning it for many more decades..

7830 2018-02-14 04:44:45 I agree that oil has values based on grade, location and time. You're grossly oversimplifying.

7876 2018-02-14 04:38:08 No No, no deep dive into Ukraine.  Because then we have to talk about oil fields and pipelines and tariffs and blah blah blah.  Can we just say that Russia annexing any territory is no good and move on?  It really should be that simple.

7897 2018-02-14 04:35:25 There were no Federal boots on ground those first 2 days cleaning up the oil washing up on shore or warning citizens and children not to handle the environment. Only thing the volunteer like me saw were other local volunteers cleaning and warning other citizens.
7898 2018-02-14 04:34:45 The oil set on fire I panicked and threw it in the sink and it ENGULFED the kitchen blinds hahahaha I win the award for worlds stupidest human
7899 2018-02-14 04:34:26 The defense of Victoria sewage discharge was always that it would be carried away by vigorous currents in the Strait.  Isn't that a formula for spreading an oil spill?

and smother all the French beaches I'd never see. I wanted to breathe smoke.
7921 2018-02-14 04:31:51 Yes they do as their salaries were on the high side already during the oil boom. Now far too high in a more muted economy. At least 10-15% cut. Highest paid in Canada.
7922 2018-02-14 04:31:38 Yes! We will flood the rivers of Germany with all the oil 
of friendship, the two have with each other. The Ottomans are the Third Roman empire, and that backstabbing traitor Italy shall know it. They had their chance. But they betrayed the allies they had, and we'll spit on them

7940 2018-02-14 04:28:31 India's oil consumption grows at fastest pace in 14 months.
When other countries are trying to move away from oil, India is still lagging behind. India needs to fasten its efforts here.

7961 2018-02-14 04:26:16 so itchy, so irritated, so red, so much coconut oil
7962 2018-02-14 04:26:12 You r destroying our environment and you don't really care about it.  All you care about is making the oil, mining & coal people happy. Most Americans want you to leave our national parks alone. Give back the land that you took.
7963 2018-02-14 04:26:09 At first I thought the obsidian pillars were oil spouts, and I thought how cool it would be to have a gated modpack that have the world kindof explode when you get access to oil and tech.
7964 2018-02-14 04:26:00 ok i finished making the lotion, which is half success
Even though it's just cocoa butter and oil, this smells kind of...awful. Now I see why people add scented essential oils to mask the 'natural' smell >.>
7965 2018-02-14 04:25:48 Who the fuck are you to totally disregard my eye witness account of what happened those first 2 days? I was part of a group of volunteers who were going around English Bay to protect citizens including:
1) warning children to stop handling the oil with their bare hands!
7966 2018-02-14 04:25:40 coconut oil nourishing deep conditioner by Hask Monoi 3 times a week and argan oil after every shower!
7967 2018-02-14 04:25:26 Although if you go totally eastern ya gotta make sure that’s another oil than olive oil :)
7968 2018-02-14 04:25:25 Use peppermint oil
7969 2018-02-14 04:25:14 my parents hate to see unwashed dishes so we got solid dishwashing paste specifically to remove grease and oil from pots and pans
7970 2018-02-14 04:25:12 Has anyone tried cbd oil for chronic pain or arthritis?
7971 2018-02-14 04:24:45 Oil, oil, oil, then wheat (Teff) , then some more oil
7972 2018-02-14 04:24:43 This man stop all this u are talking. When @GEJonathan was in Government the price of oil was $110 and a $ to # was #165 Now during @MBuhari oil price is $70 and a $ to # is #350. Pls Now tell me d different. And our budget been prepared by # and base on price of oil at $40.

7975 2018-02-14 04:24:24 Lmaoooo I reheat on stove with olive oil and butter lol
7976 2018-02-14 04:24:13 He needs to take one to Ok so he can start a prison sentence for being bought off by the oil & gas industry here. #lockhimup #ClimateChangeIsReal #traitors #ImpeachalltheTrumps #impeachthegop

7978 2018-02-14 04:23:54 If i put body oil on after i shave instead of lotion, BEST BELIEVE im showing out 
7979 2018-02-14 04:23:51 What a childish argument. Of course we need oil, we just don’t need more. Renewable energy has come a long way, it’s cheaper every day & is gaining big strides. Why triple a pipeline for a dying industry? The existing pipeline is fine. Let’s start improving the world, not kill it
7980 2018-02-14 04:23:51 The first one crumbled. The next two weren’t great. The next two were better. The final one was fine. I think it needed less oil in the pan, but also very possibly more breadcrumb and egg (although it formed find).
7981 2018-02-14 04:23:45 Oil drop hurts the oil and gas industry and associated businesses though. 
7982 2018-02-14 04:23:37 My room is literally a cloud of peppermint oil right now. My eyes burn 
7983 2018-02-14 04:23:19 Sino manuod later fil oil san juan? 
7984 2018-02-14 04:23:18 Hmmm. Compared to other gases, hindi siya nagpolymerize or nagrereact sa oil (w/c is carbon based) kaya walang combustion (?) Tapos kahit i compress siya hindi siya nagliliquefy  kasi pinaka stable form niya ay gas (?)
7985 2018-02-14 04:23:13 Got to go get me some more tea tree oil my ear got use to having it 
7986 2018-02-14 04:22:45 Wax & Oil Got DRacks

7993 2018-02-14 04:22:06 I'm shocked there isn't an actual "Rex Comus - oil baron" in Trump's cabinet already. Hell, it could be Rick Perry's real name and we never knew. #rexcomus
7994 2018-02-14 04:22:04 Me: “I’m down for late night vday plans.”

Rich:”is oil involved?”
7995 2018-02-14 04:22:01 Well of course they don’t show you what people oppose, because big oil wants to make it look like we don’t oppose it. Maybe come over to BC, breathe in some fresh air and gain some insight. See for yourself.
7996 2018-02-14 04:22:01 there’s a bacteria that can poison you when you marinate in olive oil.  To avoid it, you need to use a glass jar cleaned with boiling water and dried garlic/herbs.

8001 2018-02-14 04:21:37 It’s going to interesting to see how it all plays out. Definitely a lot of snake oil salesmen out there today. 

Btw: you should have a bit of BCH to play with now if you’d like to try it out
8002 2018-02-14 04:21:34 my life is in shambles right now. I need coconut oil to fix it.
8003 2018-02-14 04:21:28 We boil water, or rather let it simmer in the pan/skillet for a good bit, to loosen up any stuck proteins or other leftovers. Some light scrubbing while it simmers is usually enough. Pour it out, wipe it, rub it with a dab of oil - done.
8004 2018-02-14 04:21:27 No, usarían el neoliberalismo más extremo, dirían que el gobierno es mediocre y limitado y que lo debe de resolver el mercado libre y dejarán que su Golden Boy, Elon Musk lo haga. Claro que Big Oil buscaría como apoderarse de Musk.

8006 2018-02-14 04:21:18 Could see sell off 10 yr treasury yields below 2.80 seems very likely...and bearish further crude oil.

8016 2018-02-14 04:19:41 Inflation is psychological. In my model, prices are not provably efficient since key economic assumptions of rational expectations, no arbitrage conditions, and scarcity are empirically challenged (remember Peak Oil?). We can then treat inflation as arbitrary and index to fix it.
8017 2018-02-14 04:19:37 @KRQEMark The creepiness to me was that the two robots were working together. Next it’ll be subterfuge in order to steal a can or oil or something.

8019 2018-02-14 04:19:27 @EPAScottPruitt Come into the 21st century instead of going back to dirty coal, oil & drilling in our national parks. Respect the environment.  We don't have another world. I hate what you & Trump are doing to our country.
8020 2018-02-14 04:19:20 At least they don’t have to sell their oil at a discount.
8021 2018-02-14 04:19:20 I’ve been on a no make up kick for about two months. I wash with African soap and moisturize with coconut oil. My skin has show so much improvement it is crazzzzzzy

8031 2018-02-14 04:18:00 Defend from Whom?  Seems our issues since about 1815 have been wholly domestic in nature. Get us off oil and on the free energy we invented a Century ago then let the Middle East “work it out” amongst themselves. Give peace a chance.

8035 2018-02-14 04:17:29 Selling release US sanctions on RU in exchange for hacking elections. With a bonus of personally profiting off the release of sanctions on Russian oil.

8042 2018-02-14 04:16:23 The day ain't far when we're going to read about a water spill in a sea of oil. @UNEP @UNFCCC - near invisible oil spill in Asia.
8043 2018-02-14 04:16:02 Olive oil aja
8044 2018-02-14 04:15:49 Well, not really. Gasoline is two bucks a litre, which isn't that much when you're using it as handwash.

He's a retired mechanic, and it was the only thing that'd properly get rid of the oil and engine grease. Now it's just kinda a habit, I guess.
8045 2018-02-14 04:15:47 Realist shit I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
8046 2018-02-14 04:15:40 idk if this is a dumb question but is all castor oil the same? i need it for my eyebrows 
8047 2018-02-14 04:15:27 i just watched a day in the life of this pregnant girl and she put oil on her belly and there are literally half the comments of people asking what the marks on her belly are,,,,how tf do people not know what stretch marks are

8049 2018-02-14 04:15:13 What is CBD oil, and can it be used as a preventative or just as a treatment after onset?

8054 2018-02-14 04:14:48 Yeah, I don't fuck around with mine. Brush it out daily, oil twice a week, moisturise daily.
8055 2018-02-14 04:14:47 Cilantro, yes. Used Calabrian peppers instead. Couldn't find dende oil (on shopping list for next Brazil trip). Not quite spicy enough so added piri-piri at the table. Tasted very close to what I remember from Salvador.

8060 2018-02-14 04:14:11 Maybe if Trump thinks Canada is treating the US so bad, Maybe we should stop shipping our oil down there and stop giving discounted/ free electricity to the northern states
8061 2018-02-14 04:14:07 This guy isn't even from Ontario..he is probably against the pipeline but flys everywhere and uses an oil based computer and smart phone. Odds are he drives an SUV and loves @DavidSuzuki . #hypocrite Ford has been through the ringer and selling hash in HS is all they found

Make your own money Columbia, or take the Oil from Venezuela, the good old fashion way...INVADE!!!
8064 2018-02-14 04:13:56 Actually there are 2 issues here. The most important is that refining the oil into a much safer form then dilbit will alleviate a significant portion of environmental concern. Being able to sell some of the oil domestically is a bonus, particularly when US refineries are offline.

8102 2018-02-14 04:09:23 We have to make people aware that it's been the CIA/Deep State that started all these wars, especially in Syria and is supporting the ISIS terrorist Proxy Army they created to destroy Syria for Saudi Arabia's oil pipeline.
But Putin has foiled that little Globalist plan.

8108 2018-02-14 04:08:37 I sure this about two weeks ago. The reason why I shared is because everyone thinks Russia has affected our country & it’s bullshit USA has taking over almost the entire world! Where we go death follows!

8110 2018-02-14 04:08:27 Oily skin is known medically as seborrhea and is caused by excess skin oil produced within the pores.
8111 2018-02-14 04:08:27 @OliverMcGee A lot of folks were fooled by this charliton. The trick is to not drink this snake oil and think it cures climate change, white supremacy, sexism, infrastructure, idiots with a camera, and people like you. I'd call you a douche. But, a douche has a real purposes.

8113 2018-02-14 04:07:56 Check your US oil import forecast again.
8114 2018-02-14 04:07:47 There's plenty of economic and sociological history and evidence to prove that taxes and government are necessary. Without reasonable regulation, you get Enron, 'The Jungle', snake oil patent medicines. You have no evidence to prove Objectivism results in a a workable society.

8122 2018-02-14 04:06:27 If your so worried stop all the cruise ships and container ships containing millions of gallons of bunker fuel, and the barges carrying gas to the island ... or do you just dislike Cdn oil.  A spill from one of the hundreds of double hulled tankers on the ocean today is unlikely.
8123 2018-02-14 04:06:26 yung basahan o yung oil?  hahaha che
8124 2018-02-14 04:06:23 If you have some, you can add a bit of aloe vera juice/gel/extract. It's worked for me in terms of counteracting the astringency. Also are you mixing in any oil? I use coconut oil because I LOVE IT, but some people I know use 2-3 drops of tea tree, lavender or witch hazel.

8128 2018-02-14 04:05:43 Of all the thousands of myths I've read about (and had preached to me by snake oil salesmen), I've not seen one with compelling enough evidence to believe over all others.

In the end, the only evidence for your Heaven is your own desire to live forever.
8129 2018-02-14 04:05:42 Just gave my friend Catherine cbd oil , jah bless
8130 2018-02-14 04:05:39 - everyday. His hand came to rest on Jungkook's back before he sighed softly and moved him to the side. He needed to put some oil on his sore ass to keep it from blistering after the force of his hits. ] 

Need to get the oil Gukk-ah.
8131 2018-02-14 04:05:33 Tonight he moisturized it too. Along with putting jojoba oil in my scalp. It’s  been almost three years and it still surprises me when he wants to help. Lol

8152 2018-02-14 04:03:19 This was nice.
    It felt nice to feel warmth, and not worry when you didn't have money for an oil bill. . Marcos made everything awfully perfect.
    But the summers must be harder to get by.

Nik smiled and walked to the bedroom, retrieving a pair of gym shorts for Marcos.

The step that people overlook is to pat it nice and dry, add a thin layer of oil after cleaning it, then reheat the pan to settle the oil. It makes the world of difference on next use!

8225 2018-02-14 03:52:29 I would only recommend adding african black soap to your routine if you have hyperpigmentation/dark spots. If you just want acne control, you can use any scrub/cleanser with an exfoliating brush/sponge and then use a toner and vitamin e or tea tree oil (also drink a ton of water)

8227 2018-02-14 03:51:56 The outcome depends on the opening frame of your argument. Is oil the source of a problem, or the source of a solution? Seems Liberals are backstopping the former.

8247 2018-02-14 03:49:28 Basically speaking, the United Stated will oppose any Middle Eastern country that refuses to turn over its oil revenue to the multinational oil companies and live under the slavery of a debt based economy.

8255 2018-02-14 03:48:55 Thank you  Aveeno’s daily exfoliator & moisturizer, w a little Jamaican black castor oil has done WONDERS for my skin in the past year.
8256 2018-02-14 03:48:47 moisturizer will help with any over production of oil on your face too, usually your skin produces more when it's too dry.
8257 2018-02-14 03:48:32 @justinbieber  Sorry Selena, but your boy is in the oil.
8258 2018-02-14 03:48:26 New turbo is attached to the turbofold. Oil send/return lines are in. Need to tighten a hose clamp and then the water send/return is good to go. Wastegate is attached. New diverter valve installed. I should be able to get the water pump in tomorrow.

8267 2018-02-14 03:47:12 Osage Nation was herded onto Oklahoma lands white ppl didn't want because the lands were not fit for farming. When oil was found there, & Osage Nation became very wealthy, the US Gov't assigned a white guardian to each "ward," supposedly so the Osage wouldn't mismanage the $.
8268 2018-02-14 03:47:11 All of this suffering, because of America's thirst for oil and quest global hegemony!
8269 2018-02-14 03:47:06 To be fair, she has taken over from the self serving PCs so I imagine it was a mess. Then she has to suck up to the oil industry hence the greenwashing using our money in the Carbon tax. That rev should go to folks on AISH and seniors more than to oil. But there you go. Sucks.
8270 2018-02-14 03:46:42 I don't know how to describe it lol. But try some good extra virgin olive oil drizzled over vanilla or chocolate Gelato. 
8271 2018-02-14 03:46:40 No idea. IS is based in central Libya, attacked oil field last week and subject to periodic US air strikes. Diplomats concerned that continuing chaos in Libya hampers operations against IS.
8272 2018-02-14 03:46:39 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

8280 2018-02-14 03:45:55 Best purchase of 2018: Trader Joe's jojoba oil. It's great at taking off makeup, hydrating your face, keeping your hair frizz free, healing cuticles, helping counteract that chicken skin you get on your arms, it does it all and it's like $7.
8281 2018-02-14 03:45:45 I was’t referring to royalties, I was talking about the economic activity which is fueled by a healthy oil and gas industry.

8290 2018-02-14 03:44:32 I love African black soap. It dries your skin out a little but you gotta use an oil to moisturize!
8291 2018-02-14 03:44:27 Never Trump Conservatives will still cut children's healthcare without blinking and sell out the planet to oil companies.  Should never be associated with the term"reasonable" even in other context
8292 2018-02-14 03:44:18 Venezuela is an oil exporting country. It is unconscionable this nation and it's people are under such dire circumstances. It is another example that Democracy and capitalism is the fairest system to propel all peoples to a better life if they are willing to work hard.

8308 2018-02-14 03:41:19 They pour oil on unsuspecting foxes
8309 2018-02-14 03:41:07 She's certainly turned my head. I applauded when Alberta elected her and now I see that she's a Big Oil puppet.  Head turned.

8318 2018-02-14 03:39:54 All these people that don't want to drill for oil on the east coast surprise me, you don't want any drilling along your coast, you want it all on the gulf coast, maybe we should stop oil coming to the east coast.
8319 2018-02-14 03:39:31 now I know what you're thinking, sure the Phantom of the Opera came out in 1911 but what else was going on that year? well, the discovery of Machu Picchu by westerners, the theft of the Mona Lisa, 1st expedition reached the South Pole, & Standard Oil was broken up
8320 2018-02-14 03:39:26 And off-shore drilling should not be an option, either.   We've seen enough oil spills in this lifetime. The damage done to our beautiful mountains and the people who worked in those mines needs repairing before any thought about mining ever again.
8321 2018-02-14 03:39:20 @GillPowell4 - incl US industry & military. Cdn gas & oil in the ground is as good as it being part of US strategic reserve.

Since ur govt love and harbours persecution, injustice, treachery,terrorism may it be ur lots in life.
8325 2018-02-14 03:38:45 And many Republicans have been fighting high speed rail across the board. Japan's went what...over 50 or 60 years without a single accident? Our slow passenger and cargo (oil) trains keep jumping track. We need to take Congress back...
8326 2018-02-14 03:38:33 We should be refining crude oil locally to get value for a resource that is fast losing international appeal.

8343 2018-02-14 03:36:06 Well that would make sense if there wasnt all this whole drilling for oil sub plot behind the monster origins and that fake company that was part of a subplot that had a major role in the whole marketing of the first one
8344 2018-02-14 03:35:54 There has to be discipline by devotees lighting oil lamps shops having proper safety and fire extinguishers, etc, everything needs attention
8345 2018-02-14 03:35:19 Bet he just met with the Russians to follow the Oil Protection Agency Guidlines. The "OPA" what our EPA has become.
8346 2018-02-14 03:35:07 Well we have audits of continuing care in AB and so far this hasn't prevented non-compliances so I don't have faith in audits of other sectors. AER pretty captive. No way to sue AER. Redwater dec downloads liability to us. So big oil in good place. Even pore space not ours. Sad.

I exfoliate 2-3xs per week bc I have oil and build up from makeup, some do this less. moisture is a must, I use a heavier creme at night and something light with SPF for daywear.
8353 2018-02-14 03:34:45 don't be ridiculous. Snake oil is dangerous. Massively diluted snake oil, however, is where it's at.

8387 2018-02-14 03:29:31 That may be correct about Dingman Discovery No.1 , but Turner Valley was much more about wet gas than oil.

Leduc truly established Alberta, and the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, as an oil-producing behemoth.

8389 2018-02-14 03:29:09 Although brick cheese made good grilled cheese. :) That said...I wouldn't wish it on anyone today. Too overprocessed and too much salt/oil.

8391 2018-02-14 03:28:54 Sounds like it's more of the workers not following protocols established by the oil companies so really this is the area of concern. Human error. Poor job performance. Failing to follow protocols.

8395 2018-02-14 03:27:55 That and OPEC. They held us hostage for oil. GAs went from 30 C per gal to 90C in less than a year. 10gal limits, waiting in line for hrs to buy gas, stations totally out. Ppl would linenup and wait for the tanker to show up. What a mess.

8403 2018-02-14 03:26:57 I never believed anyone when they told me that if you moisturize your skin regularly that it helps with your oily skin but it does. Your skin is trying to hydrate itself so you produce oil. I started moisturizing regularly and I’m not as oily. Idk if you knew that or not. Fun tip

8407 2018-02-14 03:26:49 Started with a box mix of red velvet. Replaced the suggested 1+1/4 cup of water with a nut milk as always (and what I had on hand was vanilla almond milk with honey). Realized too late that I was out of vegetable oil so I used coconut oil instead. 

Batter tasted glorious.
8408 2018-02-14 03:26:39 I agree, not arguing w/ you there, Stephen. But we still need some oil & gas. We will always need 'some'. Wish we could go directly to green. I keep asking myself why it is taking so long & why aren't we going in that direction faster; other countries are or have.

8424 2018-02-14 03:24:40 Tar sands dilbit is a bad bet, in a market that's being displaced by lower oil prices, an accelerating transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy.

It's already a dying industry, that even smarter trans-national oil corps have been getting out of (at a loss, if necessary).

8431 2018-02-14 03:23:35 Clean coal, ah yes, so much cleaner than oil. Certainly there are fewer coal generation plants now than say 20yrs ago, lol
8432 2018-02-14 03:23:19 You're getting hysterical. The sad part of it is that you actually believe such nonsense. USA isn't doomed at all. Now that restrictions have been taken off our economy it's growing stronger. Largest producer of oil again-- outpacing Saudis and Russia.

8457 2018-02-14 03:19:59 I don’t but I’m sure any good one can be adapted. I just season and sear, then deglaze with stock and cook the noodles. I’ll add sesame or chili oil and butter to fatten it up.

8476 2018-02-14 03:15:57 I wouldn't use castor oil as a primary moisturizer bc it's not really meant for that.  I just use it specifically for acne and it's good for stimulating hair growth as well. I would say stick with coco butter as your moisturizer & keep a consistent cleansing/exfoliating routine
8477 2018-02-14 03:15:34 This weekend i think I’ll do a hot oil treatment and trim a little more

8520 2018-02-14 03:10:57 Was Big Oil proposed as a factor for going into Afghanistan? I have little doubt that was part of the Iraq invasion. I thought the main rationale for Afghanistan was "fight the terrorists overseas so we don't have to fight them here."

8525 2018-02-14 03:10:33 But can still use castor oil as a moisturizer after i wash my face? I’m currently using cocoa butter.
8526 2018-02-14 03:10:27 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
8527 2018-02-14 03:10:17 I suppose I could have worded it better, but yes, exactly what you just said Tom. At any rate that's what I'm saying. 
I keep wondering why these activists aren't protesting cruise ships, cargo ships,container ships, ferries and fishing boats. Why just oil tankers?
8528 2018-02-14 03:10:01 need a man that’s gon massage coconut oil into my hair
8529 2018-02-14 03:09:55 Maybe is my inner simple Italian, but give me pomodoro, real tomato sauce not that full of sugar and colorants and chemicals. As per mayo, is an old traditional sauce, which you can make by yourself, with yolks and oil. Then you can add awesome flavour like olives or red pepper
8530 2018-02-14 03:09:52 I will try fish oil
8531 2018-02-14 03:09:46 Got a free penguins ticket, sat next to a very nice old lady who smelt like coconut oil, the pens won. Good day
8532 2018-02-14 03:09:20 HA finally quit the olive oil job
8533 2018-02-14 03:09:20 Yes I am all set I think! I’ve been advised to use duck fat instead of oil, what are your views on this pls
8534 2018-02-14 03:08:58 Naturals should wash off their edges after a day of having them slicked tbh..especially if you don't use an oil under the edge control or gel
8535 2018-02-14 03:08:51 Tomatoes were to soft. Apples too hard. Bananas had no appeal. Tangerines too small. And all that orange oil cleans the streets and leaves a nice citrus scent for weeks! Orange you glad!
8536 2018-02-14 03:08:39 I agree. You guys should work on installing solar panels to run the bc Ferry service and on all the trains and trucks that move your imports across the continent. And maybe some batteries for the planes that use your airport. You don’t need oil. That’s old school.
8537 2018-02-14 03:08:31 You also have to take into account the transportation energy costs.  Is that oil coming from the Middle East?  Is the wood coming from your back yard?

8543 2018-02-14 03:07:41 $ZN something is fishy here.
1)Oil found in Israel=sovereign property of the state..so $$ goes to Israel
2)Israel will contract people like Chevron/ Exxon to drill, not these scammers.
3)We don't even know they actually have a well there, pics could be in Dallas w/ Israel flag.
8544 2018-02-14 03:07:36 I hope not so far I've never had a problem with it oh and I also use the baby oil gel if I don't have Vaseline to do the samething maybe that'll be easier on your skin??

8554 2018-02-14 03:06:19 I was sad as fuck before I just took the most fire nude in my life shit looks like an oil painting, I’m crying
8555 2018-02-14 03:06:08 Nice to know that Rachael Notley is (again) taking Jason Kenney's advice, by not ruling out possibility Alberta may 'turn off the taps' and halt flow of oil on TM Burnaby. Doesn't have to go that far though. Could impose a special surcharge on oil flowing to BC. As a first step.
8556 2018-02-14 03:06:01 Do you really expect an oil company to say yes sir we are screwing up the planet.  Come on!! we are talking about world greed/obligation to Wall Street and others pockets.   They don’t care and everyone knows but we Love our cars etc!!   Who’s fault really.   All of us
8557 2018-02-14 03:05:51 good, someone is finally taking notice of what the bastard Assad is actually doing, no oil so no one else cares
8558 2018-02-14 03:05:48 I ate reeeeaaal clean today. The lady that made my chili double cheeseburger wore a hair net (I made sure). The chili cheese fries had zero pubes in them (kind of a let down). The extra large roast beef sub was doused in oil, vinegar and mayo (that stuff kills germs).

8566 2018-02-14 03:05:01 When the oil companies goes out of business, be ready to travel to other countries by man powered boats. It will take 2 weeks or more to get to a place, but it’s better than adding more #CO2 by gas.
8567 2018-02-14 03:05:00 Scrub it with oil and salt. Never use soap. Wipe it till it's clean an re apply fresh oil.
8568 2018-02-14 03:04:59 I have been using coconut oil on my lips but it has been irritating them suddenly so i don’t know if my skin is just irritated and reacting badly to anything right now? given the kind i use is from the dollar tree but it is straight coconut oil.
8569 2018-02-14 03:04:49 I hope not. As a Delawarean, I don't want oil drilling off my beaches either. The problem is that so far Trump has done whatever he wants and republicans have not stepped up to stop any of it. Just the damage he is doing to the environment is horrifying. Vote in dems, Nevada.
8570 2018-02-14 03:04:35 I had just started dating my husband when I helped him change the oil in his car. He SCREAMED at me when a little of the oil spilled... it was a clue to the 3 physical beatings and years of verbal abuse to come.

2 cups of plain flour, 2 cups oat milk, 1and 1/2 TBS of baking powder, 2tbs Apple Cider vinegar, vanilla extract and 2tbs agave nectar. Mix all the wet ingredients in a jug and add to the dry. Add a little coconut oil to a pan and add the batter.
8582 2018-02-14 03:03:32 Have you tried just straight coconut oil? All natural so no extra chemicals that will burn. It spreads a TON so you only need a small amount for each use, so a jar last forever. I used to have such dry flaky skin on my face and this cleared it all up!
8583 2018-02-14 03:03:27 Roast some carrots if you got some. Toss with a drizzle of olive oil and salt & pepper. Done
8584 2018-02-14 03:03:12 They need to change the oil and everything. They could have a serious case against them if someone who is allergic to fish has a reaction

8593 2018-02-14 03:01:28 I've never had them together before! I've been skeptical about olive oil in sweet applications cause I'm so used to it's savory use. What's it like?

8607 2018-02-14 02:59:44 Though oil patterns and feel can change, what did last week's 15th place finish at the TOC do for you from a mentality standpoint for this week?
8608 2018-02-14 02:59:39 This is also tied to Russia. It’s not just sanctions. It’s the oil.
8609 2018-02-14 02:59:34 Ahh.. burning the midnight massage oil
8610 2018-02-14 02:59:29 And by the way "that US Oil company" argument is totally overrated. With oil price dropping, the US exporting 10 million barrels/day overseas the US has no commercial gain on a Oil industry that is level to ground and is own now by Russians and Chinese.

8614 2018-02-14 02:58:52 My perennial regret re: WF packing is always (ALWAYS!) lotion or body oil. Hotels are dry as fuq this time of year, and super dry skin + lots of rope is a recipe for abrasions.
8615 2018-02-14 02:58:49 These candles are soy based and have a low melting point.  Instead of melting down into wax, they become oil. They don’t get as hot as paraffin candles so you don’t have to worry about burns or getting wax off your skin.
8616 2018-02-14 02:58:34 Also who will choose the content? Lobbyists. Butter from dairy farms or margarine from corn oil which is cheaper?
8617 2018-02-14 02:58:26 @TCSVBBall congrats on another great season; tonight was tough but it has been a lot of fun since November. Take a day or two to dust off the track spikes or get some oil on that glove, spring is coming
8618 2018-02-14 02:58:18 Fact is, YVR is a perfectly safe port to have oil transported from. By being stubborn, pipelines will be built to AK, to uncharted channels, bypassing BC. If a tanker runs aground, NDP will have a hard stopping oil coming into their province with 1 hell of a mess to clean up.

8629 2018-02-14 02:56:47 the CONSUMER of our oil (USA) should wear the CO2 Footprint not the producer (AB). CDN should not be penalized for providing USA energy needs. Also East coast CDN oil refineries should bear CO2 tax on their imported oil.  Then EE Pipeline would be built right now.
8630 2018-02-14 02:56:34 What oil y’all think I should buy next?
8631 2018-02-14 02:56:22 David - yes currently most of us are still using or benefitting from oil. That does not detract from the fact that it's time for change. Electric vehicles and solar/wind power are more affordable. The technology is here to be taken seriously. We CAN transition.
8632 2018-02-14 02:56:09 This is not a painting like you have pointed out. I thought that the first time I saw it. Excellent eye. Photo screening. Not oil.
8633 2018-02-14 02:56:04 So fitting that Trump's tastes would run to porn stars. It just goes perfectly with that vulgar, blow-hard, snake oil salesman personna.

8638 2018-02-14 02:55:24 The brunette has come home with bags filled with sweet smelling items, blabbing excitedly about a holiday.

Meanwhile, the blonde is covered almost from head to toe with oil and some sort of sparkling material. Instead of actually washing in the shower, he’ll just wash his hands.

8663 2018-02-14 02:51:53 I need oil in my head everyday really.
8664 2018-02-14 02:51:53 ありがとねー
8665 2018-02-14 02:51:47 
8666 2018-02-14 02:51:44 An interesting read though I don’t agree with all the writer’s assertions or conclusions. I appreciated his use of the term “oil sands”’ however. The information on the proportionality clause was news to me. I will have to google it.
8667 2018-02-14 02:51:35 Most of the time it’s the oil talking lol
8668 2018-02-14 02:51:34 Buckets of cash? How about publishing the list of contributions from oil & gas that WV woman was removed for listing?
8669 2018-02-14 02:51:21 I am now in St. Paul and I got here because I love GOD. You are jokingYes I am getting many things that have not been done such as: My teeth needs filling, I did my taxes, I am working on gym and my hair has grown now with regular fish oil so some good things.
8670 2018-02-14 02:51:12 Screw the natives, people need their fruit oil.
8671 2018-02-14 02:51:10 Messed around and got myself a new essential oil diffuser this morning
8672 2018-02-14 02:51:04 Rubies are red
And oil is crude
Geology rocks
And so do you
8673 2018-02-14 02:50:43 I agree with that they sold the oil to who they wanted anyway.
I wish the UK and US realized that because it was their justification.

It is not the US job to crusade against Islam. Enlightment won't come in on our warplanes. Extremism is a regional and local problem.
8674 2018-02-14 02:50:28 how does Norway’s oil wealth increase their ability to provide social services vs   
8675 2018-02-14 02:50:27 Sure. Saute garlic, chilli flakes in oil then add honey according to Ur taste add the mushrooms and blanched beans. Soya sauce and saute on high flame..
8676 2018-02-14 02:50:23 just wanna add even that shit is off limits in some places. oil runs anywhere from $2.99-6.99 here for a medium bottle. and if there’s no aldi’s the cheapest eggs are around $2.99.
8677 2018-02-14 02:50:12 Can you please name your favourite '2-word' play by play comment in Oil King history?
8678 2018-02-14 02:50:02 I taktau nak pakai apa dah untuk muka ni. Any suggestion??? Sekarang ni i pakai rosa t garden of eden mild cleanser,thayers lavender toner,biore cleansing oil (for double cleansing),palmers oil for scars. But my face is getting worst :(  #tanyaTK
8679 2018-02-14 02:49:56 Well babe should love me after tonight got new oil and oil filter and fuel filters and covered my arms in diesel....
8680 2018-02-14 02:49:54 That’s how a first car is supposed to be.  Mine was a “fill the oil and check the gas” kind of car. 
8681 2018-02-14 02:49:51 I use the oil of oregano gel caps - they don't taste bad & they are small.
8682 2018-02-14 02:49:48 Adding on to kirks comment water on the oil cap/dip stick can also look a bit like tapioca pudding when its just excess moisture
8683 2018-02-14 02:49:41 When you get in bed with the Koch brothers. You will give a lot more than oil. When neoliberalism arrives you will wish for infrastructure debt.
8684 2018-02-14 02:49:40 You use financial media (BNN, Fin Post) not a far-left hippie rag. I don't recall if Harper talked down the dollar. If he did, maybe he was trying to help Ont export mfg since global oil prices had tanked. Little did we know Wynne's energy policies had already decimated Ont Mfg.
8685 2018-02-14 02:49:22 Gives @shoujo_vayne a back rub.

He’s got oil on his hands and everything.
8686 2018-02-14 02:49:11 You make it seem like the dish soap kills them, when it's in fact the oil that does it... Let's at least clean them in case they have a chance at life, ok?

8702 2018-02-14 02:47:01 Drill Drill !!! More oil the better !!
8703 2018-02-14 02:47:00 Thanks to trump, I think a lot of people have clicked a notch to the left. Independents turning Dem, Republicans turning independent. Agent Orange didn't make any friends around here with his offshore oil drilling bullshit. #BPOilSpill #FlipItBlue

8705 2018-02-14 02:46:47 I want to help you oil up completely my queen. 
8706 2018-02-14 02:46:41 Send hungry people chemically processed junk. Payoff to oil & gas guys for the transportation and another corporation for the processed junk food. So many better ways that local communities could handle this issue.
8707 2018-02-14 02:46:37 fancy that, selling oil and buying lithium and cobalt in return
8708 2018-02-14 02:46:32 it is right of Venezuelan people to decide their own destiny not NATO and USA Oil company .U have to find a way for dialogue for the interest of people from all aspect of lives.

8711 2018-02-14 02:46:15 So what happens when your oil ends up all over our coast line from a tanker spill?? Move to Alberta and live next to one of those ponds u call lakes.

8715 2018-02-14 02:45:34 More complicated than that, I think. The limitations of the Nehru-Mahalanobis strategy caught up with it, but policy switch was not made. Plus two terrible droughts and two oil shocks.

8720 2018-02-14 02:44:53 also for foundations maybe go for more of a satin finish instead of matte or dewy. it'll give more hydration on your forehead and you can always set the rest of your face with powder to control oil 
8721 2018-02-14 02:44:48 after a long hot shower , oil my body down in pure coconut oil 
8722 2018-02-14 02:44:38 definitely the oil!
8723 2018-02-14 02:44:18 I know I know, Flynn didn't get that illegal oil field deal, poor baby
8724 2018-02-14 02:44:18 Trudeau's plan from the beginning was always to destroy Alberta & this is one step closer to doing that. I guess he'll faze out the oil industry quicker then Canadians thought he would. He's a disgusting piece of .

8730 2018-02-14 02:43:44 What's different about this than the self-reported forum posts / data? Intuitively it seems to work due to 'ritual.' Taking a mouthful of oil and putting a clothes pin on nose is probably more significant than counting calories. I would like a control with vodka instead of oil.

8733 2018-02-14 02:43:13 Coconut oil makes good stovetop popcorn as well. It has a high smoke point, unlike olive oil. Sea salt and melted butter. Oh yeah.
8734 2018-02-14 02:43:12 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
8735 2018-02-14 02:42:43 I just had the best popcorn - popped in canola oil & then mixed with savory nutritional yeast, which is packed with B vitamins.

My expectations were low when I tried it, but, as often happens with vegan recipes, they turn out better than the animal-based versions.
8736 2018-02-14 02:42:15 With the amount of olive oil I used to cook my chicken, rice and broccoli tonight I may as well have just eaten cookies
8737 2018-02-14 02:42:14 That's his problem he is smoking JERKWEED grown w/Saudi Oil Fertilizers. He  should go Organic B4 it's too late.
8738 2018-02-14 02:42:11 This is such a timely reminder that oil is a filthy substance. It contaminates our world at every stage of its life -- when you drill for it, when you transport it, when you refine it and when you burn it.

8746 2018-02-14 02:41:14 I agree Helen. I would add
Term limits
Renewable energy incorporated in infrastructure (which includes Broadband everywhere)
Eliminate oil dependance completely
Rejoin Paris Accord
Reestablish Fairness Doctrine
Get out of Afghanistan
Match Community Colleges to employer need

8777 2018-02-14 02:37:44 I don't cook my steak w/ oil. I usually save that for pork chops or when I'm making ground beef w/ vegetables.
8778 2018-02-14 02:37:42 I think I got coconut oil in my eye
8779 2018-02-14 02:37:40 Brock’s right,  #BigOil in Alberta wants to maximize profits hence why they don’t push for a refinery.
If the Feds really wanted to show leadership they would offer compromise by building a refinery and as a bonus that oil could be sold domestically to Canadians! A win/win no?
8780 2018-02-14 02:37:35 Is it just me, or does cooking oil smell really good?
8781 2018-02-14 02:37:28 Is it oil?

8785 2018-02-14 02:37:08 By using John Deere Plus 50 II 15W40 and an original JD filter I can get 500 hrs on oil change interval for this bad boy.  All other oils require 250 hr interval. Therefore, I can pay twice as much for JD oil and feel like I've saved my time !

8792 2018-02-14 02:35:54 I’m starting to brush castor oil on my daughters head after I wash her hair. Trying to see if it’ll make it grow . Last time I did it it seemed like it grew a lot.
8793 2018-02-14 02:35:53 Socialism is just stage setting for communism, even though I live in Australia I was born in Venezuela which economy was completely destroyed by the good intentions of the socialist. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, how about that for a failure.
8794 2018-02-14 02:35:49 I need a bit of oil
8795 2018-02-14 02:35:42  of course squirrel oil!!
8796 2018-02-14 02:35:38 Yes, ideally eliminating future Pentagon funding, oil exploration subsidy, funding for ICE.
8797 2018-02-14 02:35:24 I also made sure to export a healthy dose of feminism instead of oil while I was there. Because that's what Canada and the rest of the world really needs.
8798 2018-02-14 02:35:20 Okay my father works in fire suppression engineering and he said this is probably accurate but the biggest financial cost would not be the water wasted but actually the use of the fire truck which uses a lot of oil and needs regular maintenance.
8799 2018-02-14 02:35:14 This great news. In addition to the important collections at Schlesinger Library (hello, Alice Paul) I get chills just going in there looking at the oil paintings hanging on the walls: all women.  @radinstitute
8800 2018-02-14 02:34:59 Hence Canadian oil trading at half of Brent crude!
8801 2018-02-14 02:34:40 I am learning forensic accounting to determine damages especially in mega commercial/Investment disputes and yesterday one of the worlds top forensic accounting experts witness said “When called to determine the value of an oil refining plant in Nigeria, it had no value“

8803 2018-02-14 02:34:32 That is unethical oil from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, so that's okay. No protestations needed. Meanwhile ethical oil from AB stays in the ground and 1000s of high paying jobs for Canadians stay on the shelf. Does this make sense to anyone?
8804 2018-02-14 02:34:27 Yeah, would not want some one impersonation the political seat of the President be political. It's best not to upset the #maga #dupe #Snowflakes who get so riled up when you mock man_child #Dotard you snake oil sales man and performance artist.

Read more. Less internet. 
More nature. 
Less crowds. More great people.

8811 2018-02-14 02:33:25 We're historically communist and had Russia fight the US on our territory largely with using our own people. We played a part in our own war..but the global interests of capitalism and communism largely fueled it on for 31 years. We give the US oil and have given diamonds etc.
8812 2018-02-14 02:33:15 Tea tree oil face wash from the body shop works well for me. Highly recommend
8813 2018-02-14 02:33:06 Let's put it this way Americans pay first class tickets for this guy to destroy national parks ,add more pollution to the air ,drain oil from oceans sounds great !yeah!
8814 2018-02-14 02:32:47 Would help Russia and US very much if ME oil was wiped out. After we helped build it.
8815 2018-02-14 02:32:16 Woman to the cashier at the store: “Do you have any GMO free Valentine’s cards?”

Woman: “No, the actual cards. I already have essential oil packets. Just need the cards.”
Me: 
8816 2018-02-14 02:32:12 Did you know that offshore drilling causes oil spills?
8817 2018-02-14 02:31:58 They probably don't know how to change the oil in their car.

8828 2018-02-14 02:30:30 You mean, in 2009 when Dems had filibuster-proof government and we got a right wing healthcare bill and kept torturing folks in Guantanamo while opening the arctic for oil drilling and allowing cops to bash in occupy Wall Street protesters? Yeah, I remember

8831 2018-02-14 02:30:24 Who says Carbon Tax doesnt apply to oil in the ground.
He needs $ and doesn't care where it comes from
8832 2018-02-14 02:30:23 Starting a series of oil paintings for my exhibition this summer. Excited!
8833 2018-02-14 02:30:06 I got rosehip oil, almond oil, and cocoa butter. 
Alrighty, time to make me some lotion!
8834 2018-02-14 02:30:05 The Republican Party sold their soul to Putin, the NRA, the Koch’s and big oil years ago. Why are you surprised about this? Citizens United was supposed to achieve this goal, republicans support this decision. Again, you’re surprised by this? Come on!
8835 2018-02-14 02:30:00 Did you travel somewhere far during the long weekend? If you’re experiencing some bad jet lag, apply lavender oil to your temples or your pillow for a nice restful sleep! #healthtips

8837 2018-02-14 02:29:58 what do you use for oil in concrete. 15w40 or gear oil
8838 2018-02-14 02:29:54 I dig the oil painting feel
8839 2018-02-14 02:29:42 We knew Pakistan is a terrorist factory...so did the world...but is it the step to stop/kill terrorism by root...or superficial...I wonder why this all started after finding oil in Pakistan....why roots of terrorism are always connected to oil...
8840 2018-02-14 02:29:41 The deforestation of the Indonesian Rainforests - driving Orangutans, Sumatran Tigers and Rhinos to the edge of extinction, is done to grow Palm Oil and Pulp.

8845 2018-02-14 02:29:30 I did that with my cinnamon oil allergy + fireball it's ok
8846 2018-02-14 02:29:25 Good point though, as a lot of sell side reports touting backwardation being a bullish indicator for oil. I just think it is way to crowded especially when it was at one point 10 longs to 1 short.
8847 2018-02-14 02:29:24 Got my coconut oil and my witch hazel 
8848 2018-02-14 02:29:14 Apakah ini the power of bulus oil?
8849 2018-02-14 02:29:13 Plenty of those types of picks out there. don’t put a lot into any draft guru in any sport (who the eff is Mel Kyper, ). But the Oil must’ve seen something to take Leon at 3.  As I wondered in another tweet to Mike, do they take him if they were 2 and the Sabres 3?
8850 2018-02-14 02:29:07 Now everyone hates coconut oil

8869 2018-02-14 02:27:29 Make sure your skin is generally well moisturised
Make sure your beard area is wet with warm/hot water, shaving oil is really good and conditions the skin, also get a styptic pencil (helps stop bleeding quickly) - but personally I prefer using an electric lol it’s WAY easier!
8870 2018-02-14 02:27:23 Gel or oil?

8873 2018-02-14 02:26:57 We need to use Paper Ballots & count by hand all votes! Kick this traitorous GOP out on their ass! Get to the bottom of Koch Industries corruption & also Putin! Oil companies don't have country's! Their loyalty is only to ! Citizens United opened the flood gates of Dark !

8875 2018-02-14 02:26:43 For thousands of years lighting oil and ghee lamps has been important part of worship for devotees in tn temples. Inscriptions after inscription. Condemnable Tn govt has banned it using Meenakshi fire.
8876 2018-02-14 02:26:36 How about we use our on oil, process it and sell it to Canada. Endangering OUR waters to send Bitumen to China -Ridiculous
8877 2018-02-14 02:26:34 Oil change for my car went from $35 to $75..wtf !
8878 2018-02-14 02:26:26 My skin is so dry and itchy I can’t fall asleep. Why did I have to run out of baby oil  I’d sell my soul right now for the French version of skin so soft

8880 2018-02-14 02:26:06 Yeah I gave up beer untill the Oilers win record is better than .500. The Oil Nation guys started making sacrifices and I joined in by giving up beer.
8881 2018-02-14 02:26:00 That’s nice for you, glad to know your employer gives you so much time off.  I do have a degree and I did work for a major oil company and I do have compassion for those who struggle everyday.  So sad you don’t, but I bet you’re a good Christian otherwise.
8882 2018-02-14 02:25:53 i think the new graphics suck,,,,,ESPECIALLY not showing oil prices in a oil state,,,,,
8883 2018-02-14 02:25:51 They would have sold oil anyway, the point is that these countries have allowed radical whakos to destroy their lives and threaten others
8884 2018-02-14 02:25:39 Sell some oil and invest.

8887 2018-02-14 02:25:20 It isn’t going to create very many jobs for very long. It may be that ABns don’t fact check, they just believe propaganda? Maybe that’s why AB has no money after gebnerations of oil wealth and Norway has $1Trillion?
8888 2018-02-14 02:25:11 Clove oil. Magic shit.
8889 2018-02-14 02:25:09 Q3. Use red lentil puree as a replacement for some of the oil in breakfast muffins to go. #getprepped #oursecret

8898 2018-02-14 02:24:00 Long before SNAP and Food Stamps, the Dep’t of Agrivu[ture gave out surplus cheese, peanut butter, corn oil

8899 2018-02-14 02:23:42 Rich or poor, republican or democratic, we ALL deserve clean air and water! Slashing the EPA serves NO ONE other than Big Oil, the Koch bros and Trumps other cronies.
8900 2018-02-14 02:23:38 Well then you failed. Not only failed but backfired. Iran was a pretty moderate nation in the 40's.

The religious nuts used the Shah we installed and protect as the kindling for their revolution. You got what you worried about because Iran sold oil to the Axis.
8901 2018-02-14 02:23:34 Wouldn't you be able to beat them easier with oil 
8902 2018-02-14 02:23:33 And why does it shock anyone “T” is busy about a trial in Northern Sk and is sitting on his hands about transporting oil in a safe pipeline....
8903 2018-02-14 02:23:07 it took me a lil over 2 hours to wash, detangle, condition, & oil my hair then put it in a bun... things like this is why I wanna say fuck it and just cut it off.

8912 2018-02-14 02:21:54 Okay it's actually not simple math, because the US has lower oil prices at the pump than the UK, why do you think that is?
8913 2018-02-14 02:21:29 Depends on the specific oil lobby.
8914 2018-02-14 02:21:05 Markets do not work. IMF Externalities: Prices Do Not Capture All Costs.

8918 2018-02-14 02:19:54 I think the misconception arises from the fact that in many places, most especially rural communities and small towns, there was a lot of brick weed and home grown up until the late 80's, in my experience the late 70's and early 80's good hash and oil was easier to come by.

8921 2018-02-14 02:19:04 It sure seems like oil is the only commodity people actually make money on. Why not nat gas, coal, uranium? Comparable market sizes kind of

8930 2018-02-14 02:18:06 I was just using that as an example. So what about oil money, because that's most politicians.
8931 2018-02-14 02:17:46 It is best Stephen, but we can't turn the switch off just like that, right? Of course, I agree to leaving the bitumen in the ground, because there is enough other oil & gas that can be produced. Thanks
8932 2018-02-14 02:17:41 After stealing red oil from momma and poppa house. Made some cassava leaves finally. Come eat
8933 2018-02-14 02:17:30 The most significant election meddlers have not been identified..  Sorry to say, it's islamic oligarchy. Literally fueled by Saudi oil money. Let it sink in, research investments made to whom and where. Check#Comerica Bank for a start.
8934 2018-02-14 02:17:12 The argument that in order to fight climate change we need to sell (and thus burn more oil) is Orwellian. More war for peace?

8937 2018-02-14 02:16:52 And a bill failed yesterday which was to give us a $5000 pay raise. However, the bill also included a tax break for oil companies, who already barely pay anything. Many see the failure as being against teachers when in fact it’s against oil companies not paying.
8938 2018-02-14 02:16:49 Oil near farmlands just sounds like a bad idea. Oil is turned into plastic and animals are dying in the ocean because of it. 

If farmers are complaining about oil refineries, oil refineries are too close to the farm soil.

No oil fertilizer for me thank you.

8950 2018-02-14 02:15:29 You hugely underestimate the worlds demand for oil. Gasoline is only a fraction of the usage

8987 2018-02-14 02:10:31 Tanker traffic is a valid concern but the fact is the demand for oil is ever increasing for atleast another 20 years so whether its AB oil or Saudi oil the oil will be flowing

Must take into account the policies implemented in past admins 1984 Reagan growth reforms after Carter & 70s Oil Crises & Depression

Until then, keep thinking someone who's never lived like a hard working person will fight for regular people.
9020 2018-02-14 02:06:03 I was too busy planning the oil crisis 3 years in advance.
9021 2018-02-14 02:05:49 But not at the risk of a spill in our Waters. This point people seem to forget what is at risk for BC. Why is it that Washington and Oregon politicians see oil off their Coast as bad and ours don't?

I’ve also been very into ricotta toast lately.

9132 2018-02-14 01:51:38 And speaking of thawing, global warming would result in making exploitation of arctic oil reserves far easier to extract and ship.
9133 2018-02-14 01:51:34 Great idea. Maybe refine the oil in Alberta? Imagine all the jobs it would create. We all know it's not about jobs though. It's about the profits of 1 US oil company based in Alberta
9134 2018-02-14 01:51:22 Maybe your friends from big oil can explain this to you?

9140 2018-02-14 01:50:21 Oil is hardly ethical. Often those with low incomes especially children are exposed to the traffic and other pollution it causes. Plus the impacts of climate change more likely to impact those with low incomes.
9141 2018-02-14 01:50:17 Biodegradable packaging and environmentally friendly (sustainable fish, no palm oil, circular meat (not raised on soya or crops), often home grown and cooked) production.
9142 2018-02-14 01:50:06 LA and So Cal in general are too obsessed with avocado. I’m allergic and it sucks having to constantly sub things out because everyone uses avo (or worse, avo oil) in their food.

9191 2018-02-14 01:44:13 However, I disagree with the "Mis"use of the Far Left term
corporate welfare, we give tax incentives to farmers who grow 
tobacco, because we need the larger tax benefits, same for
oil/fossil fuel/ mineral exploration, we need companies to take risks
by offering lower taxes

9227 2018-02-14 01:39:26 Not an ideal term for oil, considering the tightness of supply (when balanced).  Hard for any producer to add volume, then drop volume, as needed.  Thus the never ending price fluctuations (don't get me started on crude speculation...biggest econ mistake the world has ever made)
9228 2018-02-14 01:39:03 Colorado regulators of the oil and gas industry are poised to approve tougher rules for underground pipelines. But locations of many existing pipelines remain unknown. Companies will have to tell regulators where new lines are installed.

9230 2018-02-14 01:38:53 Respectfully, this is the dumbest thing I've ever read. Stop drilling shale oil wells, with borrowed OPM, and this time next year America's "milestone" of 10MM BOPD drops to 6MM BOPD. KSA has over 230 GBO of PDR, America's shale oil plays, about 18 GBO of PDR. Get real !
9231 2018-02-14 01:38:53 And yet you @ianbremmer publicly sustained that Chavez regime brought a cut in poverty... Maduro's economical disaster is consequence of Chavez's earlier policies which eroded our economy and made us overreliant on oil prices

9233 2018-02-14 01:38:45 i know that tea tree oil is horrible for dogs, not sure about other animals
9234 2018-02-14 01:38:40 ...which is the same as the oil industry, just without the money.
9235 2018-02-14 01:38:34 The control of oil and dope
9236 2018-02-14 01:38:25 Don't worry. There's an essential oil for that.
9237 2018-02-14 01:38:20 Fascinated by naysayers. These are the same people who are fine with money on the sly to Republicans from big oil, drug companies, and their ilk.

9240 2018-02-14 01:37:42 What I’m getting from this is that you can stop the sun from rising.
Have you considered a career in the oil industry?
9241 2018-02-14 01:37:35 i’ve read that essential oils and essential oil diffusers are toxic to cats... can anyone back this up? bc i have a diffuser that i just started using but i don’t want to make my kitty sick :(

9243 2018-02-14 01:37:22 Take a large pan pizza pan, one pump of oil, one ladle popcorn, cover with thin crust pan, send through oven half way, spray with garlic butter, then shake parmesan breadstick mix over the top. Heaven.

9246 2018-02-14 01:36:37 Urban decay de-slick oil control you can buy the travel one but you're prob gonna end up getting the full size anyway
9247 2018-02-14 01:36:33 America is energy independent again and is the NUMBER ONE producer of clean oil and coal., Thanks to President Trump.
9248 2018-02-14 01:36:28 Some experts on electric car technology say that electric vehicles will be more cost efficient than ICEs after 2020. If correct, the price of oil will flatline or decline, thereby hurting Iran's govt revenue and economy.
9249 2018-02-14 01:36:05 Canadians need to know that Trudeau and his gang of socialist THUGS want to destroy the Canadian economy by shutting down the oil industry. It's much easier to control a nation when it is on its knees.
9250 2018-02-14 01:35:39 Sorry, but BC should not have to jeopardize its economy and environment so that a private US oil company in Alberta can sell Canadian oil to China. I support BC's gov't actions. If you really cared about jobs, you'd be investing in jobs of the future, not the dying oil industry.
9251 2018-02-14 01:35:28 Wish oil and water would get pressed
9252 2018-02-14 01:35:22 Sen. Toomey, I find you to be totally unfit to be PA Senator. You do whatever you want to do , directed by the oil  and gas $ paid to u. You dont even fake that youre concerned with what all your constituents want. You are abusing the powers of this office
9253 2018-02-14 01:35:22 When u go get ur oil change and they talking to u like u don’t know shit only if they knew that I know more than my exs put together smdh .  When I tell them what was what they looked at me shocked and one said u are 100x sexier to me now

9256 2018-02-14 01:35:06 coconut black castor oil is THE best! 
9257 2018-02-14 01:34:52 Good hummus is a little dense in calories just because of the oil but a quality oil is worth it plus the fats in the beans themselves are the best thing for you.

Checking the oil and water before I have a road trip
9264 2018-02-14 01:33:36 It's exactly what BIG OIL needs to keep oil high enough that they can profit.  Currently oil prices are set to drop as an over abundance is available.  War screws up the supply chain ini the regions and creates more local demand.  War burns a lot of gas. Tillerson knows this.
9265 2018-02-14 01:33:08 Quickly ran out of arguments I see. Before you start scoring Godwin points, ask yourself why you insist on sending your money to big oil. Ask yourself if you are ready to pay to host climate refugees. Fossils are finite anyhow, either we get rid of them now or pay more later.
9266 2018-02-14 01:33:07 Sorry @bcliberals, supporting a private US oil company in Alberta over the interests of BC residents is not a way to regain power in BC. Also, can you please change your name to BC Conservative Party... Cause let's be honest, you aren't liberal

9279 2018-02-14 01:31:02 We have the reserves, not so sure the capacity or pipelines to meet US demand this year with the way Canadian oil is getting gutted. Pipeline issues likely to dominate the discussion. Think we both agree, they will have issues finding that <32 oil. Canadian demand underestimated.

9301 2018-02-14 01:27:01 oil guys are a different beast. At the end of the day the majors are specialized in one thing - raising from capital markets. So they can and are pushing into new markets (offshore wind) that makes it less hard to believe that what’s good for them is bad for us
9302 2018-02-14 01:26:47 my acne scars are gone, tea tree oil truly magic!

9304 2018-02-14 01:26:40 How about you get on her case about cleaning up the tailings ponds and the abandoned oil wells? That would increase Alberta's credibility and be really useful. Not enough attention from that?

9312 2018-02-14 01:25:47 I can't track down any current data but worth noting that there is a decent number of oil and gas workers residing in BC (particularly north island and interior) that fly into camps in northern Alberta.

9325 2018-02-14 01:22:49 It's not a toxic political environment it is a toxic @EPA dir that should listen to the American people rather than hide in his office, oil company offices or in First Class and the people in First Class have the same complaints as coach @ScottPruittOK is a MORON on the take $$

9333 2018-02-14 01:21:10 Yikes. Pretty sure you’re not supposed to let pure oils have direct contact with the skin. I’ve heard that some people bath with the oils but we are talking drops of oil mixed with a carrier oils and then put in the water. Even then, they have warnings about direct contact.
9334 2018-02-14 01:21:09 Does it have THC? Otherwise you're eating just essential oil.
9335 2018-02-14 01:20:58 I think I might try the oil, it could be just what I need.

9361 2018-02-14 01:17:24 World chess body has Swiss bank accounts frozen after president accused of links to Isil oil deals and faces a "serious problem" paying bills just weeks before its flagship world championship play-off tournament in Berlin which has a prize fund of $460,000.

9363 2018-02-14 01:16:44 The Obama holdover agency members are burning the midnight oil on multiple fronts, including assisting the ‘police’ in Israel to unseat #Netanyahu. Obama remaining in DC is no accident. He’s not done striking back at the ‘colonial west’ in honor of his fathers.
9364 2018-02-14 01:16:41 It's really not that simple because oil subsidies, food subsidies etc keep prices lower and actually undercut markets for certain goods in other countries in terms of food, like corn/rice. You literally have no idea what you are talking about.
9365 2018-02-14 01:16:35 I need a oil change.
9366 2018-02-14 01:16:30 new fav lines from petitioning today : “ya I don’t believe in global warming” “I don’t like the environment” “F*** THE WORLD” & my favorite “I POUR OIL ON DIRT HA”
9367 2018-02-14 01:16:25 Bitches be thinking they bad and boujie until you hop in their car and the sticker on the corner of the windshield tells you their car is 6 thousand miles past due for an oil change.
9368 2018-02-14 01:16:16 What about oil and gas workers or mom and pop service companies. The wine industrys loss is a fraction of what albertans face
9369 2018-02-14 01:16:15 I have 3 mouse traps in my room and sprayed it with peppermint oil I swear to fucking god if I wake up to a mouse I’m done
9370 2018-02-14 01:16:15 3) they don't deliver fuel oil unless it's a minimum of 150 gallons. That's almost $350.00.  If I kept my house at 68, that 150 gallons would be gone in 3 1/2weeks. Gas is$2.75 gallon. Some ppl actually use food stamps the right way, and do work. But bc of idiot dems, we struggle
9371 2018-02-14 01:16:03 It sounds like the Bureau of Land Management is trying to hide what they are doing! They are slaughtering our wild horse herds to free up land for welfare ranchers who pay pennies for cattle grazing and for big oil! Tell your Congress people to stop this murder racket for money!
9372 2018-02-14 01:16:00 It's like (to use an analogy probably counter to my political opinions) the car industry getting angry on behalf of the oil cartels when electric cars turn out to make much more sense.
9373 2018-02-14 01:15:47 I don't see why folks can't use oil and ask for responsible environmental policy. It's possible to have two opposing ideas in one place.
9374 2018-02-14 01:15:37 There is no method to trumps madness he is simply an incompetent snake oil salesman who preys off the feeble minded
9375 2018-02-14 01:15:37 Mike is malfunctioning. Maybe he needs to oil his joints or something
9376 2018-02-14 01:15:37 Trump's Blue Apron plan to replace SNAP is a brazen handout to Big Olive Oil.

when y'all make ramen do you add anything to it or just eat it as it is? 

When I make mine I put 2 eggs, soul seasoning and sriracha in it. Sometimes scallions and sesame oil too if we have it. And soy sauce uwu 

I make a mean ramen. Hmu fams

9387 2018-02-14 01:14:27 Why do they call it the Garden State?

9389 2018-02-14 01:14:04 I wonder why there is need of charity to feed the poor but not to build nukes,subsidize oil,pay for war. Seems to me like everything should be charity founded,no?

9399 2018-02-14 01:12:54 An NDP gov in Alberta manages to get a pipeline done with a fed Liberal gov and the whole country benefits. Some need to stop pretending we don’t sell oil and take risks doing it just to try and buy votes. Lets do our best to make sure its done as safely as possible is paramount.

Thanks
9406 2018-02-14 01:12:13 After exfoliating, I put just a tiny dab of castor oil on any breakout areas and my skin starts to feel smoother literally by the next morning 
9407 2018-02-14 01:12:12 Plus, you must have better food banks, because I've never gotten oil or eggs at any around where I live.
9408 2018-02-14 01:11:41 Oil her up creeped me out too much tbh
9409 2018-02-14 01:11:36 I finally got my oil changed

9418 2018-02-14 01:09:13 It would help Alberta's credibility if the tailings ponds were cleaned up and the abandoned oil wells reclaimed.

9420 2018-02-14 01:09:11 Also fun side note i hit a ice chunk last night on my way out of work, now my car sometimes does odd things. Tho that could be a lack of oil or some other things since in winter it does weird shit
9421 2018-02-14 01:09:07 Oh, and #JoelOlsteen conman does not like you talking about daddy snake oil salesman. Another good way to get blocked. Throw in a few biblical references and  you’re outta there!
9422 2018-02-14 01:08:53 Because neither KM nor Alberta govt have responded with a clear plan for an oil spill that could devastate OUR economy. That’s what BC has been asking and waiting for...in vain. I know AB thinks it’s the center of the universe, but other provinces matter too.
9423 2018-02-14 01:08:50 one drop of peppermint oil in m bong has my throat feeling sooo much better
9424 2018-02-14 01:08:41 Where?
With no sugar, no paper toilet, no food, no free market, swimming in oil but with no gas.
Seems socialism looking from here.
9425 2018-02-14 01:08:11 My guess is CBD oil would help these babies.
9426 2018-02-14 01:08:11 Depends... do they have oil?

9430 2018-02-14 01:07:25 How often do you oil pull? Do you do it before or after you brush? I'm interested in trying this now haha.
9431 2018-02-14 01:07:11 Use aloe vera gel or tea tree oil  might work for u!
9432 2018-02-14 01:07:06 That's so funny! Never tried it but my Mam did +she said it not good dude so you must be onto something here. I do like coconut oil tho as long as you keep it in the fridge+you break your spoon trying to hack it out
9433 2018-02-14 01:07:06 Chicken fajitas are pretty easy! Just cut the chicken into small strips, cut some peppers, put them on a baking sheet and mix with fajita or taco season mix and olive oil. Bake for about 15-20 minutes on 350 and that’s it!

9440 2018-02-14 01:06:33 Most Albertans would like to support pipelines and oil issues but first we have to determine if we are “Sewer Rats” or “Nazi”
9441 2018-02-14 01:06:32 Are you kidding? Shift gears and get out of the oil industry. We don't want your crap on our shores.
9442 2018-02-14 01:06:29 I have put so much peppermint oil on my head today I'm surprised I haven't burned a hole in my head yet
9443 2018-02-14 01:06:11 FINALLY got an essential oil diffuser 
9444 2018-02-14 01:05:54 I don’t think it’s a dick move - ppl had 3 weeks to buy $5 tix and they have enough for all students it just sells out when they open it to the public. Also turning $5 into $60 is V tempting when you’re broke af haha

its a creation armed by hillery Clinton Israel turkey Saudis uk +usa intelligence agencies/so being in the in crowd of neo-con war hawks she would of course know or have been told the well known truths of this issue for irael to retain gholin heights oil reseves
9447 2018-02-14 01:05:30 Yes, I have. The renewable energy industry is doing very well. There will always be a need for oil, but not 2 burn it!
9448 2018-02-14 01:05:28 So Nigeria don't have other industry ?
We don't Agriculture?
We don't have cement industry?
We don't have entertainment industry?
What industry in Angola apart from oil is special?
Is Angola not an oil dependant economy like Nigeria ?
9449 2018-02-14 01:05:23 I also think he needs to invest more in renewable energy. Oil and coal will pass us by very quickly and we don't really have a back up
9450 2018-02-14 01:05:12 the truth is, crude itself is getting harder and harder to drill. From the middle of oil country here, it collapsed a few years ago and will continue to be more rare because it is, you know, finite resource

9485 2018-02-14 01:00:18 Canada’s #WorstPMever once again denies Canada its economic potential as the world’s 3rd largest holder of proven oil reserves, and the prosperity Canadians so richly deserve for generations to come.
9486 2018-02-14 01:00:12 yeah, they're both byproducts from the same source. I don't think you can convert them? It's like, a density / purity thing and the crude oil just has a ratio of the two inherently

9500 2018-02-14 00:59:07 at the beginning of the year I decided to clean all my makeup brushes but really fucked them from using too much coconut oil. i’m too lazy to rewash them so it’s resulted in me only using like 2 bushes out of the 1723728 I have #queenoflazy
9501 2018-02-14 00:59:07 too bad Zinke wants to open it up to oil & gas exploration
9502 2018-02-14 00:59:01 There’s no olive oil in this house so im just gonna order pizza 
9503 2018-02-14 00:58:58 just got an essential oil called Joy, so hopefully I stop being a miserable cunt. I’ll keep you all posted
9504 2018-02-14 00:58:55 It’s time to start drilling for oil in Alaska so that it gets a higher population and more money to the state, this way the USA will hopefully start doing better in outdoor Olympic events.
9505 2018-02-14 00:58:50 So Jamaica stop getting oil frm Venezuela, all curtesy of United States of America hope this don’t affect us in the future.. #WereDidOurIndependenceGo??
9506 2018-02-14 00:58:39 มันจบแล้ว...
9507 2018-02-14 00:58:07 Yes, but I'm pretty sure they get made in the same refinery process from crude oil
9508 2018-02-14 00:57:36 Vendor booth was $4500 replaced the entire HVAC , plumbing, and electrical in my apartment building $45K food truck oil change $1500 
9509 2018-02-14 00:57:31 Today marks one year until my coconut oil expires. Relationships with deadlines suck

9512 2018-02-14 00:57:19 the oil is their main goal
9513 2018-02-14 00:57:13 shoutout purivera facial oil!!!!
9514 2018-02-14 00:57:03 There not much civility "in the marketplace?" Seriously?  Translation: Pruitt has so screwed over an essential agency, all but destroying it, & has gotten so cozy with oil barons and King Coal that he fears for his life?  I think he's paranoid and probably should be. Despicable.
9515 2018-02-14 00:57:00 EVERY time I go to get my oil changed the guys working tear me apart
9516 2018-02-14 00:56:59 As for Venezuela, - the price of oil fell, leaving the economy in a state of free fall. Mismanaged yes, failures yes, but then there are also failures here (Carillion). Also, are we that reliant on Oil exports here in the UK? - I hadn't realised Britain was dependent on such.
9517 2018-02-14 00:56:57 Your scientific method prefers the oil be shipped through the mountains perched precariously on two pieces of rail steel then?
9518 2018-02-14 00:56:28 Tea tree oil in alcohol or vinegar is great for killing mold, though it sometimes requires multiple applications. I judge this by smell, but now the two smells have become overlayed in my mind to where I have difficulty distinguishing between the disease and the treatment.
9519 2018-02-14 00:56:24 my mom: “my friend said she smokes the CBD oil and it makes her calm and relaxed. she doesn’t fight with her man no more.”


9520 2018-02-14 00:56:20 Good Lord may you bless every girls makeup skills today and protect our foundation from sweat/oil and flashbacks. Amen
9521 2018-02-14 00:56:20 my mom is so cute she took my car for an oil change and a car wash 
9522 2018-02-14 00:56:19 Not as worried about the oil side, but the meal side I believe is getting panicking shorts tripping over themselves.
9523 2018-02-14 00:56:19 The world don't want Canadian oil like they use to. To expensive and to many regulations. The world is now flooded with oil as it is. We put all our eggs in one basket and now we're screwed.
9524 2018-02-14 00:56:16 Tea tree oil works wonder!
9525 2018-02-14 00:56:11 Everyday somebody trying find out what cologne / oil I have one lol
9526 2018-02-14 00:55:56 Showing me an breakdown of Alberta industries by GDP contributes nothing to the conversation about transfer payments. Yay, oil and gas is our biggest sector, who knew??
9527 2018-02-14 00:55:55 The short answer? My doctors office is discontinuing pain medication so I need money to buy CBD oil for pain. I have surgery for an artificial disc in my neck coming up but cancer is causing a lot of pain as well. So much so I think about killing myself every day it’s so bad.
9528 2018-02-14 00:55:50 Ah, coconut oil has low smoke point.
9529 2018-02-14 00:55:49 Guess @Liz_Wheeler doesn't approve of eggs, spinach, mushrooms, cabbage, real cheese (not oil made to resemble cheese), fruit, zucchini, broccoli. That's what I bought when I had SNAP. I don't use cigarettes or drugs or alcohol, or even drink soda. I drink water and tea.
9530 2018-02-14 00:55:44 For 13 years I been using wild oregano oil (carvacol) as a medicine. It is miraculous.
9531 2018-02-14 00:55:43 ggwp!!明日こそはぜひ勝って欲しい！！
9532 2018-02-14 00:55:31 @marthamaccallum Great segment on snap program, my concern takes me back to childhood. I remember the silver can with black large letters “ Chicken “ whole packed in oil. Powdered milk, government cheese which tasted like flavored wax. Times were hard,the food came in a box.
9533 2018-02-14 00:55:28 U FINALLY TRIED THE WAVE MAKER YASSSSS also hella agree on the moroccan oil spray and the smell of the love touch just fucks me up 
9534 2018-02-14 00:55:27 It would be easy if you just finished reading a section on the effects of oil on Venezuela.
9535 2018-02-14 00:55:05 This is straight out of Putin's playbook. Who owns infrastructure in Russia? Oil, gas, electric, steel, etc? Putin and pals. This is how Pence, Ryan, McConnell and their benefactors #Koch brothers et al seize more control and turn America into Russia II
9536 2018-02-14 00:54:52 I’m having a rough ass fucking day man WOW I just wanted to get high and def forgot my car keys are MIA so can’t get my weed or my hemp oil
9537 2018-02-14 00:54:49 I see he’s using Rawlings glove oil for hair dye. Also known as “The McCarver.”
9538 2018-02-14 00:54:30 it is so i use cooking oil
9539 2018-02-14 00:54:07 “And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.””
Revelation 6:6 NKJV
9540 2018-02-14 00:53:59 it's over for y'all....I FINALLY bought castor oil
9541 2018-02-14 00:53:56 When there are no monies for the National Parks, they can clear all the trees and dig for coal and drill for oil. Keep your eyes open.
9542 2018-02-14 00:53:32 Tea tree oil good for breakouts I use that too but sometimes the smell be getting to me. But it works really good. Like overnight. Not all will go away in one night. But the next day you could notice
9543 2018-02-14 00:53:20 Almond butter and coconut oil are two things you don’t need to tell me how much to use.. let the coconut oil and almond butter do the talking here. #coconutoil #almondbutter #MakingAmericaGreatAgain
9544 2018-02-14 00:52:20 Shhhh it was supposed to be a pancake. Poor thing can’t cook. They think it’s better with water and coconut oil than milk and eggs.
9545 2018-02-14 00:52:17 I need a oil change now...he did that.
9546 2018-02-14 00:51:51 I'm thinking it would be kinda interesting to publish all the (near) free energy patents held by oil companies and military contractors. Eh? 
@wikileaks
9547 2018-02-14 00:51:46 Just drank a Pepsi that tasted like gas or oil can someone From Pepsi contact me ASAP. Emergency jthayer35@Yahoo.com something is serious. Wrong
9548 2018-02-14 00:51:37 Looks like they find lots of oil.
9549 2018-02-14 00:51:29 Stop using motor oil on your hair, buddy.
9550 2018-02-14 00:51:25 Oolala!  Sarkozy struck Libya because he wanted part of that country's oil business and didn't like Qaddafi talk about the Golden Dinar.  Macron's France should stop bullshitting the world.
9551 2018-02-14 00:51:20 what's the butter to oil substitution ratio, I gotta try that
9552 2018-02-14 00:51:16 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
9553 2018-02-14 00:51:15 Edmunds is going to blow the roof off of Lucas Oil.
9554 2018-02-14 00:51:06 Repetition and maybe some rosemary oil
9555 2018-02-14 00:51:06 They should make candles that smell like garlic sautéing in olive oil
9556 2018-02-14 00:50:54 Frying eggs for breakfast then oil rocketted to my cheeks, near my right eye! They say - everything happens for a reason. Hmmm ... What is the universe telling me?
9557 2018-02-14 00:50:50 Our dollar is weaker because there is no demand for Canadian dollars from foreign investors. Our dollar was strong when oil was strong. Does that tell you anything?
9558 2018-02-14 00:50:48 Been using thieves oil this season, either works or I've been lucky. Feel better

9560 2018-02-14 00:50:12 Emilyisms-“if the government can worry about the oil Mrs Mike’s Chips uses they need to start worrying about getting me my tax return money” #shecracksmeup
9561 2018-02-14 00:50:11 My favorite example is congress repealing the dark money regulation on the oil industry using CRA. This was supposed to make it so doing business in a foreign country with lax financial controls didn’t end up financing terrorism and dictators.
9562 2018-02-14 00:50:00 Zucchini, sautéed with garlic in butter and olive oil, tossed with fresh tarragon and a good grind of salt and pepper, is fantastic. A taste of spring!
9563 2018-02-14 00:49:57 My first and last name translates to Olive Oil :(:

9565 2018-02-14 00:49:27 We must be grateful for the great benefits brought to us by the fossil fuel economy - but, like whale oil, it's time is over. We cannot continue, we must transform.
9566 2018-02-14 00:49:21 Is #corruption in #America so rampant that lawmakers can do whatever the want?
Ejecting a woman for revealing oil and gas company donations to state lawmakers look bad.
9567 2018-02-14 00:49:18 What about the oil and gas museum
9568 2018-02-14 00:49:15 @PristineAuction I have a John Stango of Wayne Gretzky it is an oil painting signed it’s is about 5’ by 3’ can you tell me what I need to do I ?
9569 2018-02-14 00:49:12 I fully support the #KeepCanadaWorking mouvement. The US is laughing at us right now because we are enabling them in their quest for dominance in the oil industry. Wake up Canada.
9570 2018-02-14 00:49:11 Tea tree oil a great! It’s just pretty strong so if you’ve never used it on your face before you should dilute it with water at first
9571 2018-02-14 00:49:06 <オイルをぶっかけオイルをぶっかけられヌタヌタのヌラヌラのテカテカにしたろか?
9572 2018-02-14 00:48:52 We call them 'staples'. Rice, flour, oil, canned goods. Oats, butter, cheese.
In bulk. You can learn to cook.
9573 2018-02-14 00:48:17 Mlm td ttdow then tbangun pkl 1. Sbb too sleepy nk buat night routine so just wash my face, put on moisturizer n face oil.
9574 2018-02-14 00:48:14 the soothing sensation of boiling oil in your eye. >>
9575 2018-02-14 00:48:02 Smashing a bottle of olive oil on the floor is one of my worst fears. How long did the clean up take? Or did you just roll in it and let it moisturize you?
9576 2018-02-14 00:47:58 Have you played with ArtRage? very "oily" mix-y oil paints.
9577 2018-02-14 00:47:55 with olive oil on top 
9578 2018-02-14 00:47:27 Gee I guess the Bush administration should have thought about that before invading. I seem to remember hawks claiming Iraq could pay for its own reconstruction with oil revenues.
9579 2018-02-14 00:47:01 What is the matter with you? Promoting a recipe filled with sugar, white flour and vegetable oil as healthy?? You're a Healthcare company for goodness sake; surely you know those are the worst ingredients for our health, right?
9580 2018-02-14 00:46:58 PRIMARY INDUSTRY SECTOR - Agrigulture, Fishing, Logging, Mining, Oil & Gas exploration and production, etc.
 SECONDARY INDUSTRY SECTOR - Manufacturing, both durable and non-durable goods, plus construction.
 TERTIARY INDUSTRY SECTOR - Service providers.

9581 2018-02-14 00:46:58 Wow. Swapping SFA for MUFA or PUFA had a profound impact in lowering LDL and TC. Would love to see @ketochow try olive oil too. Great stuff! Thanks for sharing.
9582 2018-02-14 00:46:57 Part 2 State legislatures, Congress should fine oil companies, coal companies for trillions of dollars in damages to Medicaid, Medicare, environment.
9583 2018-02-14 00:46:55 a happy medium at 3.25 would be reasonable if it means oil prices skyrocketing but gas being that high means cost of living go up too. I ain’t tryna pay 15$ for a gallon of milk lol
9584 2018-02-14 00:46:44 even in Germany, a lot of people have to buy what has "most calories per Euro".

You can survive with € 0,15 a day, but that's on crappy pasta w/ a bit vegetable oil and some tomato concetrate to have taste.

It'a bad sign for a country when half the pop. relies on ALDI pricing!
9585 2018-02-14 00:46:43 The face soap changes. A friend and I have a tradition of gifting each other fancy soap whenever we travel. I get vegetable oil and goat's milk and shea butter type soaps scented with a local botanical.
9586 2018-02-14 00:46:41 No reason #Crude #Oil $CL_F should be ~$59... #Oil doesn't need to recover overnight... but it certainly fell a bit too fast on liquidity move while the stock market was margin calling everyone... If stocks can find a reason to recover, there are many more reasons #Oil will too.
9587 2018-02-14 00:46:40 Quite the sticky web of lies she has cast on the record. Baffling gall because she has done so for decades. How any *thinking man or woman bought the snake oil and voted for her is also baffling.
9588 2018-02-14 00:46:27 Gas, insurance,  registration... ah, the joys of adulthood. Tires, oil changes... list goes on forever.
9589 2018-02-14 00:46:26 Apparently they may have be involved in drowning of sunken oil tanker
9590 2018-02-14 00:46:25 She damned well should be referring to the Harding administration-you  wouldn’t believe the stuff we got away - sold a damned national monument to the oil companies we did!
9591 2018-02-14 00:45:48 nothing feels better than oil paint
9592 2018-02-14 00:45:39 NEW DOSE OIL IS HERE!!! Grape Ape, Green Crack, Permafrost and much more!!!!

9594 2018-02-14 00:45:33 Big oil has nothing to do with it. How do you expect people to get from place to place? Electric vehicles? Magic hydrogen powered cars? Stop driving? The rest of the third world is industrializing and you want to commit suicide on a national scale.
9595 2018-02-14 00:45:33 Apart from taking oil fields any other agenda as to why they attacking?

9597 2018-02-14 00:45:12 The torch is definitely worse than searing in a hot pan, at least in my experience.  The only advantage to the torch is that no extra oil is necessary (which is important if you're fat-phobic).

You will know things are better when oil and gas are taxed at the regional average.

9606 2018-02-14 00:44:08 Does anyone else’s hemi engine do through oil quickly? I have to put at least a quart in when I hit 3,000 miles
9607 2018-02-14 00:43:59 Society has collapsed once or twice in the next century. 

PR? Politics? Gone. 

Modern technology? Destroyed when the nukes went off.

Oil reserves? Depleted.

But I *can* handle a sailing ship pretty well, and I’d be a good first mate for a roving band of sea pirates.

9612 2018-02-14 00:43:25 I’ve gotten the oil pretty under control. Finally. I usually use medium to light coverage.
9613 2018-02-14 00:43:22 @HardballChris  Chris you seem to badger Kennedy. Why do we need a cutesy slogan??  When even the slogan "at least you can flip burgers" is going into the dust bin of history. Our fate was sealed when Nixon & China, and U S Steel went into the oil business & shut steel mills.

9623 2018-02-14 00:41:45 Should have changed oil to WD40 
9624 2018-02-14 00:41:31 Every cent of income earned on my Cleveland Plain Dealer paper route in 1987 was dedicated to paying for gas and monthly oil changes for my ‘77 Chevy Nova. It got 7 mpg and my high school social life couldn’t exist without it.
9625 2018-02-14 00:41:30 Over the past two weeks: #Crude #Oil has dipped down to ~$59 from recent HIGHS of $66.66 for the sole reason that March options expire tomorrow & roll must take place within the next 7 days... this is purely shaking out the weak $CL_F longs, many weeks ahead for price to recover.
9626 2018-02-14 00:41:27 Uh-oh. Much better than vice versa, except your Hycosan nozzle is no longer clean. I nearly got my eye drops and Olbas Oil mixed up the other day, which would have been extremely painful!

9631 2018-02-14 00:40:54 At the rate of US production, Canadian heavy can't keep up. Canadian heavy oil seeing cutbacks and not much investment. Problem is the majority of #CrudeOil requires a heavy grade for blending and reading people suggest the #Cushing draws are related. Can see issues soon. #OOTT

9652 2018-02-14 00:38:24 I literally fried the rice. I just don't season it much. The only thing that goes on my fried rice is sesame oil and whatever I'm eating it with.
9653 2018-02-14 00:38:24 I agree about trying to make peace especially with Russia. But Russia is hacking into our elections and I think we're going to punish them by lowering the price of oil in the world it also hurts Iran when we do that.
9654 2018-02-14 00:38:01 Giiirl, that’s why you have to do your own oil change, saves you 5 hours of wait time and 45 dollars

9657 2018-02-14 00:37:48 We won't stop consuming oil, Dr. Stein. Just a One-Day No-Sale, would devastate the Dow Jones. On a larger scale, I tend to think it's The People V Sophia. A.I. is a VERY SERIOUS problem.
9658 2018-02-14 00:37:13 We sell them our oil at a 20-30% discount from world market price and supply 15% of their oil. If we can get Transmountain done then we can stop selling them oil and get fair market value for it. Then we really won't be treating them like the special princess Trump feels like.

9662 2018-02-14 00:36:51 I’m not a fan of hot oil treatments simply because I don’t feel comfortable heating up high quality organic oils as this can minimize it’s beneficial qualities due to heating. But I’m a huge fan of using raw organic oils as a treatment and scalp massaging.
9663 2018-02-14 00:36:32 I don't know. I budgeted & did without. Rent &  utilities first, spaghetti with garlic & olive oil. Not even meat sauce!

9667 2018-02-14 00:36:21 You might consider it as a kickback from the oil companies.
9668 2018-02-14 00:36:08 Yeah because the FBI and CIA has the best interest of the people in mind, yeah right, if theyh don't get a war with Iran they'll just push for war with another country for oil or some bullshit. All I'm saying is it is important to remain critical of these people.
9669 2018-02-14 00:36:05 Recently, I was struck by the large number of impressive mosques being constructed in Canada. My guess is that most, if not all, may be financed by foreign regimes.

So we import oil that finances mosques to foster Islam in my country.

What a very stupid country we’ve become!

9693 2018-02-14 00:32:45 Yes. But it is also to maintain power. If there are other currencies that oil can be sold in that would not bode the best for America which is why they shut down anything like the Petrodollar

9729 2018-02-14 00:27:51 It's a fact that after the TV area was drilled up by ~1920, there was a decades long drought of discoveries, and Imperial almost gave up and were seriously looking at gas-to-oil technologies instead. Leduc was the real start to the "modern" industry.
9730 2018-02-14 00:27:25 shall gas is proven not profitable at all. Hence that is why the oil price increases.

9801 2018-02-14 00:16:35 Do you really think #TMP gives any concern for the people of B.C. or 
Canada for that matter.  The bottom line is getting oil to global markets?
9802 2018-02-14 00:16:28 #Trudeau is doing exactly what they planned, kill the oil, (AKA the west) and make Ontario a dependent, broke  province. Plus get #CBC & #MSM to spread their identity politics to create division. So far so good as far as the Liberals are concerned.
9803 2018-02-14 00:16:28 It strips all the oils out! Some oil is good — it's necessary to keep your skin healthy and moisturized
9804 2018-02-14 00:16:28 What is the purpose of oil in the gym? Does he want to look like he is perpetually in a bodybuilding competition?

9806 2018-02-14 00:16:16 Not entirely sure, but somehow he came up with a production rate of 900,000 barrels/day @ $50/barrel. £16,450,00,000 (!).

This he declared the value of the exports.

The sum total of oil produced in Scotland(?) was exported. Apparently.

9825 2018-02-14 00:13:55 A nice, warm, foot bath sounds like the perfect thing. Give those #toes and beautiful #soles a good rub with a salt scrub and then follow it with a nice olive oil massage. 
9826 2018-02-14 00:13:53 I hope not without diluting it with a carrier oil!
9827 2018-02-14 00:13:30 Lmao jk you’re olive oil

9834 2018-02-14 00:13:06 FYI: I can understand what Uncle Trump is doing. Tax cut will benefit his family business and his friends who donated millions of dollars to his campaign. Lissa Lucas from Ritchie county, WV exposed money local politicians received from oil industry. Uncle Trump is no exception.

9837 2018-02-14 00:13:00 Rule of thumb - change your oil every 3,000 miles (5000 km) or 3 months. (whichever comes first) #NoResetButton

9842 2018-02-14 00:12:16 I bought a fake Morrocan Oil and I'm really hoping it will work
9843 2018-02-14 00:12:08 @HollyConrad Your broom seems to be burning oil. May need a new head gasket. :)
9844 2018-02-14 00:12:03 @realDonaldTrump  why is the price of gas going up, up , up, when we have new lines out west and oil production up in our country?
9845 2018-02-14 00:11:55 @SecretaryZinke will there be a 21st year?  Or haven’t you decided to open up all those areas to mineral extraction, hard rock mining and oil and gas leases yet?
9846 2018-02-14 00:11:48 To weaken Russia, to weaken the resistance, for the benefit of Israel, to cut deals with Saudi Arabia and Qatar for securing their proposed gas and oil pipelines through regime-change. Take your pick. Extrapolating on these is more than I'm willing to attempt on Twitter.
9847 2018-02-14 00:11:47 Did you recently go and get your oil changed?
9848 2018-02-14 00:11:43 Moving like she’s frying chips with all that oil 
9849 2018-02-14 00:11:35 I’ve been poor enough that the only thing I could afford was flour and oil each week and made biscuits for a month straight. $15 is a lot when you don’t have it.
9850 2018-02-14 00:11:22 I agree! I’ve personally found that emotion definitely comes across more in my traditional work eg. Oil painting and charcoal drawing! But the better your technique, the easier and more moving the emotions are to convey
9851 2018-02-14 00:11:17 Y’all be snapping and driving, and I look at y’all dashboard your check engine light on, oil light on, low tire pressure and your tank be on E. Get y’all priorities straight. #vontewords

9853 2018-02-14 00:11:12 Baby oil really helps to take it off !

9855 2018-02-14 00:10:57 I wonder what people were doing before cooking oil? How were they frying stuff? Like, how did McDolands function back then? What about them golden french fries, were they gold or just regular soggy boring yellowish brown, the color of the ground (ew), fries?
9856 2018-02-14 00:10:50 Different country with lax regulations and standards.  Apples to oranges.  This also is nit a oil tanker spill.

9861 2018-02-14 00:10:06 Doesn’t excuse only having one type of oil
9862 2018-02-14 00:09:55 Oil companies. Banks. Politicians homes. People who fight change for corporate interests. People who are willing to see the world collapse because they don't believe in climate change.
9863 2018-02-14 00:09:54 "There's really no excuse for it," said panelist, Barbara Passero from the class of 1975 on the topic of solar energy and the fact that so much of the world's energy is powered by oil. #Sustainability

9867 2018-02-14 00:09:22 Wow I really just spilt half of my Kiehl’s oil over because I wasn’t wearing my glasses 
9868 2018-02-14 00:09:09 That's a contradiction as you know, because the reason for the pipe is to increase oil production by expanding the market.
9869 2018-02-14 00:09:03 Fun fact : when restaurants have cheap wings it’s bc it’s the last day before they throw out the oil they HAVE USED ALL WEEK . YOU ARE EATING FOOD THATS BEEN FRIED IN OLD OIL THAT THE RESTAURANT HAS USED ALL WEEK TO COOK
9870 2018-02-14 00:08:46 I just remembered, palm oil is also used for some pie, cookie and cake brands. Replaces lard or beef fat and has a somewhat longer shelf life.
9871 2018-02-14 00:08:23 i do them in olive oil
9872 2018-02-14 00:08:21 I use OGX's coconut milk shampoo and conditioner along with the coconut oil spray that they have! I love the way it makes my hair look, and that it smells amazing!
9873 2018-02-14 00:07:56 The refining in Alberta is only logical conclusion but for some reason these lunatic right wing tar oil lunies dont get it wont even discuss it they were told decades ago .Their toxic dilbit pipeline thru BC land and waters is just a insult thanks to corrupt BC Liberals

9920 2018-02-14 00:01:51 There's little difference between cutting funding to national parks--which in turn leads to increased entry fees and cuts in staff--and taking public lands for oil and gas development. Both reduce access by the people national parks and public lands were meant for.
9921 2018-02-14 00:01:43 I guess @Glenn81079903 needs to go back to school and learn to read and not only read and accept the argument of what the far right party mentions in this article. I thought he was a little smarter, but no, I guess thats why he still supports oil. smh stuck in the past
