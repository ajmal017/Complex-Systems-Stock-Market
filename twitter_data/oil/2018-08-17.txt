49 2018-08-17 23:55:29 Here’s the real concern. The next time copper goes into deficit, it’s going to make the last parabolic spike look minuscule. There’s less investment into new mines (like with oil industry for few years out.). There’s been a lack of investment into new production for 2022+

59 2018-08-17 23:54:08 I just read a farm magazine article all about farmer's meeting the demand for oil seeds. Consumers demand it we grow it. That's how it works. Increase demand=farms grow more of what pays.
60 2018-08-17 23:53:53 my cat is such a mama's boy, my wife and i left the house last night and he got so upset he ran around screaming and yowling until he puked. he's got a pheromone oil diffuser to keep him calm or else he won't fucking eat. what a goddamn idiot whom i love so much
61 2018-08-17 23:53:38 Thus begins @zakgersten's transition from  @TuftsNutrition to PhD studies on fisheries & nutrition @umichsph.

Our taste-test verdict:  The sardines are similar, what's  really distinctive is the olive oil.

My prediction: Zak's future discoveries will have larger sample sizes.

67 2018-08-17 23:52:47 FACT: Burning any hydrocarbon (coal, oil, natural gas) produces CO2.  It’s a tried and true chemical reaction known as combustion. 
FACT: CO2 traps outgoing radiation which releases energy in the form of heat, causing surface temperatures to rise (like the glass of a greenhouse)

88 2018-08-17 23:48:49 You do realize your gem of Norway is the population of 2/3 of NYC and as ethnically homogenous as the Bronx is ethnically diverse? And this little gem of a country can only do this because of its vast oil reserves.

96 2018-08-17 23:46:53 I have a big problem with your show today. I about broke the tv when you quoted Elon Musk saying that Tesla gets 1/1000 the subsidies of oil and gas and you left it hanging out there as if it was a fact. That is not a fact. That is blatantly false. Oil and gas gets 0 subsidies.
97 2018-08-17 23:46:50 PLENTY at a policy level. Crying doesn’t register on my list. Trudeau pretending to give a damn about #environment and #FNMI then backpedaling on campaign promises and buying a used pipeline for $2 billion to support oil are things to focus upon when critiquing, not tears.

101 2018-08-17 23:45:56 Why not ask me for some oil ? Guess what again? I poured that shit right back in my bottle, I dare her ask me about it
102 2018-08-17 23:45:50 Also, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but body dismorphia is a disorder that presents in all sorts of way, and can be tied to other mental or emotional disorders.

Someone could, for example, have dismorphia and post lots of selfies designed to exaggerate a part of themselves.

113 2018-08-17 23:43:55 Africa deserves whatever the West and Asia throws at her. A continent that is enormously endowed with mineral resources, safely located against earthquakes, tsunami and other ND but has deftly refused to help herself.

The only continent with excess crude oil, but imports petrol.
114 2018-08-17 23:43:55 Please remember that socialism has failed in every place it has been tried.  i.e.:  The nation in the world with the greatest oil reserves is Venezuela.  They now have a socialist President.  The people are starving.  Socialists only pretend to share with the people.

119 2018-08-17 23:43:20 They're both stores of capital that also produce or replace labor. (interesting how a lot of economic and political things started to shift after the oil embargo in 1973)
120 2018-08-17 23:43:15 Exactly! The US seizes and held the money. We don't steal! Just like we wouldn't "take the oil" in Iraq. Amy had her back against the wall and throws that nonsense out.
121 2018-08-17 23:43:00 If OIL & WATER doesn't mix, surely being MESSY & ANOINTED won't either
122 2018-08-17 23:42:48 Just curious. You reference $USO in you article, are bullish oil but not long $USO. Why?
123 2018-08-17 23:42:35 I’m partial to olive oil & some balsamic vinegar .. but you kno, butter is good too.
124 2018-08-17 23:42:13 omg my dog won’t eat when I need him to take his pills, so much stress

I usually use clean peanut butter/wet food to coax him to some food or and if I need to melt the meds in very small amount of coconut oil and soak it in a small piece of bread. 


125 2018-08-17 23:41:56 I support exploration on any US domain that helps us become self dependent,  thus bringing down the worlds oil prices in turn easing the hit on the working mans wallet to commute back and forth to his or her job. You can still take that walk
126 2018-08-17 23:41:43 Alberta's oil industry still only represents 2.2% of Canada's GDP. That is a fact you cannot propagandize your way out of.
127 2018-08-17 23:41:32 My cars happy fresh oil change and full tank 
128 2018-08-17 23:41:28 Try put it in an old bottle so it wouldn’t look suspect, bitch so you just happen to  have the same smelling oil in a bottle that just happened to have the same amount that was missing from my bottle

133 2018-08-17 23:40:45 Some more snake oil.
134 2018-08-17 23:40:23 I’ve thought that for years! “It couldn’t be about slavery because  most rebels were too poor to own slaves.” Just like our Middle Eastern wars are not about oil because few soldiers own Exxon stock.

137 2018-08-17 23:40:13 Just mix one egg and like a spoonful of olive oil mayo together!
138 2018-08-17 23:40:12 With all respect, I don’t think General Electric, maker of gigantic offshore windmills, is an eco-company. They’re in it for the $$$. FWIW- oil & gas companies receive plenty of taxpayer $$, too, but two wrongs don’t = right. Corporate welfare in any fashion = fraud on taxpayers
139 2018-08-17 23:39:59 ‘Blood and [s]Oil’ seems to be a thing with this administration. But maybe some are good people.

141 2018-08-17 23:39:31 Sounds like the fan needs to be disassembled and washed! I used to use a citrus oil spray for a room freshener when The Tall Boy was potty training. Worked great and was totally natural! Frebreze is nasty.
142 2018-08-17 23:39:30 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
143 2018-08-17 23:39:27 Remember I said  my brother girlfriend stole my oil.... guess what? She did I found the shit in her room. Had the nerve to put it in an old bottle.
144 2018-08-17 23:39:27 そだてるぜぃえい！！(*'ω'*)
145 2018-08-17 23:39:24 It does where I’m at because it’s oil field land and they want all my dollars
146 2018-08-17 23:39:23 High gas prices are a result of higher taxes that go to government coffers not oil companies. The fact that doesn’t make sense to you is frightening.
147 2018-08-17 23:39:17 Bless random shops around here w hemp oil and shit my anxiety was killing me
148 2018-08-17 23:39:01 The feeling that I’m about to play in Lucas Oil is insane !!!!!!
149 2018-08-17 23:38:47  RT @mdeeeeee_: Lol caucasian women in the style industry just discovered olive oil sheen?
150 2018-08-17 23:38:44 Don’t trust @ebay “Money back guarantee” it’s just marketing snake oil. Buy at your own risk, and sometimes get screwed.
151 2018-08-17 23:38:40 Only the oil family is doing that.
152 2018-08-17 23:38:38 I have strong feelings about most Mayo in the US being soybean oil, emulsified.
153 2018-08-17 23:38:33 Not once has the DNC been responsible for the availability of gas in your car. Taking money from big oil is done so CONGRESS turns around and gives BIG OIL $9,000,000,000 in welfare subsidies all the while they rake in record profits every year! You just get screwed.
154 2018-08-17 23:38:31 Today I went to get a $60 oil changed that turned into $400 of problem. I texted my dad for help and he said “lol welcome to adulting!!”

I am taking applications for a new dad
155 2018-08-17 23:38:27 @TrainDems if you keep fucking american working and voting democrats by taking coal money, oil money, bankster money and worker enemy money than you'll never get a dime from me, not a sou: stuff your coal money up where the sun don't shine
156 2018-08-17 23:38:23 It would be very difficult to make emissions worse. As stated, the oil sands are perhaps the most carbon intensive sources of energy on earth and should be among the first shut down.
157 2018-08-17 23:38:21 Olive oil (or any vegetable oil) will soften the flakes making them easy to wash off with mild shampoo. But you need to leave it on for about 12 hours. Repeat every day for a couple of days.
158 2018-08-17 23:37:40 why not? if your last name is oil?
159 2018-08-17 23:37:22 @claresiobhan I use the clean and clear oil absorbing sheets for my very oily skin and they work amazingly! They also don’t take your makeup off which is a big plus
160 2018-08-17 23:37:07 I'm glad Maduro finally has new look economic program. If only US would lift its economic war. By buying more #Venezuela oil. Or something.

162 2018-08-17 23:36:23 @expta wait until you see the corn and oil I ordered at @ThreeDotsCHI you need to specify whether you want a traditional version or Kevin's interpretation.
163 2018-08-17 23:36:01 NDP oil policy = Fail.
164 2018-08-17 23:35:50 If I break your heart na oil spillage......

165 2018-08-17 23:35:26 Trudeau has nothing to do with world oil prices! Fear mongering again #AltRtAndySneer 
166 2018-08-17 23:35:18 They know they numbers are dwindling and they climbed on this group of cons. We’re past peak oil and evangelicals
167 2018-08-17 23:35:18 Might take a break from actual bud and get jiggy with oil for a little while
168 2018-08-17 23:35:09 Oh no that’s true but when you’re trying to build some oil doesn’t matter where there’s a will there’s a way
169 2018-08-17 23:35:08 Mm never used that one before I’ve only used olive oil n started using coconut oil
170 2018-08-17 23:34:58 Few drops of essential oil on vacuums air filter. House now smells like a lavender field...I dont hate it.
171 2018-08-17 23:34:47 ベアじゃね??
172 2018-08-17 23:34:42 Olive oil, coconut oil - or regular cradlecap shampoo. T-gel also works well, you just can't use it on babies.
173 2018-08-17 23:34:20 My rule of thumb is always putting enough water so it reaches to the ligament of your index finger from the rice. Also putting a thin coat of vegetable oil at the bottom so it doesn't burn
174 2018-08-17 23:34:07 Bolivar is equal to one half of 1 sheet of toilet paper.
175 2018-08-17 23:34:01 Less bombing than in1991
More deaths from ieds than anything else
You were wrong about the oil
Wrong again on this
176 2018-08-17 23:33:45 ajay said ariana and pharell are like oil and water.. "THEY JUST DON'T MIX" 
177 2018-08-17 23:33:00 Tahu gak teknologi andalan @ForceMagicID? Teknologi eucalyptus oil yang dimilikinya mampu menolak nyamuk masuk ke ruangan. ForceMagic 2 in 1 juga mengandung sintestis dari bunga krisan, yang mana molekul micronsnya dapat bertahan semalaman.
178 2018-08-17 23:32:58 Baby oil >>>
179 2018-08-17 23:32:51 Let's sell the strategic oil reserve to my friends. Either that, or put it on eBay
180 2018-08-17 23:32:46 Teatree shampoo with concentrate conditioner. Then massage in some baby oil and wipe off the excess
181 2018-08-17 23:32:37 Pres. Theo. Roosevelt (R), trustbuster of railroad, banking, oil&gas trusts, playing censor/gatekeeper of business. Equal access to essential services is (R) dogma. Capital, rail, fuel=essentials of economic life. No access to Twitter, Facebook cripples press, politics, commerce.
182 2018-08-17 23:32:31 Looks like 98% of the next generation will have autism and the other 2% will just fucking die, neato!

Only 2030 kids will remember losing friends because their parents gave them flaxseed oil for smallpox.
183 2018-08-17 23:32:25 I agree that my comments expose my political bias. As do yours.  Venezuela's suffering started well before any US sanctions. They sit on the largest oil reserves in the world and yet have refugees streaming from the country. Are they all lackeys of the USA?
184 2018-08-17 23:32:14 I think this is measuring energy of the fuel.... if so FF are ~30% efficient, we only need to replace the useful energy, not fuel that goes up in smoke. Just getting started with EV's so looking at power alone would be more instructive (ie no oil). Also data is only through 2015.
185 2018-08-17 23:32:00 Tried CBD oil tea for the first time this morning, just before happily going through a six and a half hour Stata course. Pretty sure that's the best endorsement it can get.
186 2018-08-17 23:31:57 And Putin has control over tons of gold, trillions of carats of diamonds, Oligarch billions, rivers of oil, lakes of gas, plus org crime income streams of drugs, prostitution, etc etc. 
187 2018-08-17 23:31:53 This gold mkt will continue to expand until a massive gold derivatives failure. There will be a mad rush to dump paper and buy gold! You see, the bulk of tradable gold will never come back into the mkt, "in terms of currency"! It will return as a trade for "another commodity" OIL
188 2018-08-17 23:31:47 Somebody put oil all over that BALL!!  my dawg hunter ain’t no FUMBLER..
189 2018-08-17 23:31:27 I love @GTsKombucha but the Lavender Love flavor needs work, I feel like I’m drinking out of an essential oil diffuser
190 2018-08-17 23:31:22 Uhhh no oil did I say something about oil? Nawww nothing about oil
191 2018-08-17 23:31:22 Did I really qualify for a discount on my oil change today or did they just give it to me bc I’m cute and don’t know anything about cars?????
192 2018-08-17 23:31:08 Anyone who makes a career out of killing brown people and children overseas for oil and corporate greed is a wacko ...this Admiral is no exception.
193 2018-08-17 23:30:40 Home. Pasta with truffle infused olive oil, cream, and porcini mushroom sauce and riccotta cheese.  I had to stand over a hot cash register line for a few minutes to get it (the sauce)...but it was well worth it.  #LGM!!!
194 2018-08-17 23:30:05  Use lavender essential oil as perfume to help start the day with peaceful vibes

197 2018-08-17 23:29:59 @elonmusk My dear Mr Musk, you must stop using any of the sleep meds known to cause automatic behaviour and/or amnesia. Using cannabis oil, preferably with equal parts CBD and THC, plus melatonin will relax body and brain. You will sleep. Talk to a good physician. 
198 2018-08-17 23:29:58 I’m well aware of the benefits that oil derricks provide fish, especially for the recreational fisherman. The main drawback is the potential for catastrophic spills.
199 2018-08-17 23:29:44 I tried almond milk,I love it！

Ohh!Nice tryI try to change when cooking too,solt,oil and more
But I love sweets...I tend to overeat mindlessly

201 2018-08-17 23:29:36 How is that possible do these have more oil in them than normal cartridges?
202 2018-08-17 23:29:31 Lol caucasian women in the style industry just discovered olive oil sheen?

What a shame, if USA stop buying oil to the dictatorship, in few days would collapsed! What happen Mr. Trump? Art you afraid of Maduro?
207 2018-08-17 23:28:28 Sick human beings. He deserves to be stuffed in an oil bin

210 2018-08-17 23:28:19 Nothing to do with oil & all to do with government.
You don't compare Scotland to Nigeria and Venezuela do you???
211 2018-08-17 23:28:09 Have to wait two and a half hours to get an oil change.
212 2018-08-17 23:28:04 I need to find some oil for pen 
213 2018-08-17 23:28:00 Yikes! Bro? My da delivered home central heating oil. I'm dreading looking at Pornhub... 
214 2018-08-17 23:27:49 Coconut oil, argan oil
215 2018-08-17 23:27:33 Tell them you just want a conventional oil change , i would also check to see what oil the make and model of your car should be using
216 2018-08-17 23:27:19 do you recommend seabuckthorn oil for oily acne prone skin? @HeyAprill @caveofbeauty
217 2018-08-17 23:27:07 I might just prep it myself - cut it up and coat it with olive oil, pepper, etc. I just hate that he basically wants to pitch it instead of cook it up.

THE GUY: Didn’t wash his hands
219 2018-08-17 23:26:43 however, it is the oil wetting the water, not the water's inherent wetness

therefore water can be wetted but is not in and of itself wet
220 2018-08-17 23:26:36 All of those tourists covered with oil.
221 2018-08-17 23:26:31 went to the store for coconut oil and bought 2 giant bags of takis and 16 face masks i'm fine why
222 2018-08-17 23:26:19 Yes, the ratios have changed - the world's population has grown at a smaller pace. Satiation is one reason. Eat fish or meat and you get protein and nutrients alongside the fat. Eat soybean oil and you just get the fat. Whole foods generally better than heavily processed stuff.

224 2018-08-17 23:25:51 We’ve had to have “the talk” about appropriate attire. He’s finally ready to keep his Camo pants and tank tops for around the house! He likes to wear this when he’s out doing yard work or changing the oil in the car! :)
225 2018-08-17 23:25:48 Well, you sure are witty, aren’t you? The issue is whether you support oil & gas exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. Care to comment?
226 2018-08-17 23:25:17 I had my first khaleeji customer last week and i was really upset about the way she reacted when i said im tunisian so i told my uncle and he said 'just wait till them khaleejis dont have oil anymore' and i just stayed quiet
227 2018-08-17 23:25:11 Asalin rough play ma
228 2018-08-17 23:25:11 Where? Who? Which industry? Extracting coal? More drilling for oil? Offshore? Mineral extraction ruining out National Parks? I grew up in Los Angeles with SMOG and marine life dying from oil waste - what are you bringing back to continue the slow death of America?
229 2018-08-17 23:25:09 Por que não fazem nada contra as ditaduras sanguinárias da África? Os absurdos em Mianmar?

230 2018-08-17 23:25:04 you find oil rig go dey top plus your first class so see some shit you dey tell me, Ei Dannyy
231 2018-08-17 23:24:54 AB has taken a rational approach, even though we are an oil producer. We have implemented a carbon tax & are using the revenue for "green" projects while we transition.
232 2018-08-17 23:24:47 U know I'm a good boi
233 2018-08-17 23:24:39 My mom used to save the oil smoked oysters were packed in to use on grilled Havarti sandwiches the next day. I know it sounds really weird, but it is .
234 2018-08-17 23:24:13 These are all MSM distractions from the CIA's opioid/heroin crisis [sic] which is a distraction from - what? The end of oil and subsequent "Collapse"?
235 2018-08-17 23:24:13 Spray bottle wit water n conditioner or oil is key 
236 2018-08-17 23:24:04 sometimes you just gotta let extra virgin olive oil marinate in your hair for 6 hours and then it’ll finally be healthy
237 2018-08-17 23:24:00 Double cleansing must be with oil based cleanser or can use exfoliator? #tnyaTK @twt_kecantikann
238 2018-08-17 23:23:59 Honestly I was shocked they came out this good  but i just used some grapeseed oil
239 2018-08-17 23:23:35 @elonmusk it’s telling that you’re only criticized as the CEO of Tesla and not the other great companies you’ve drove. Me thinks someone doesn’t want you to succeed in disrupting the automobile industry - and oil.

241 2018-08-17 23:23:26 I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings
242 2018-08-17 23:23:25 Fair enough. Oil & gas exploration should mix well with fishing. It seems to work in the Gulf of Mexico. Might as well include windmills, too.
243 2018-08-17 23:23:20 The Ohio State DV story has turned into a car service appointment for an oil change and you end up finding 7 other issues on the car you weren’t looking for in the first place.
244 2018-08-17 23:23:06 WE COMING  Lucas oil @8:30 be there 
245 2018-08-17 23:22:59 Talking frozen? ....Fresh cut....blanched...fried in oil. into brown bag...salted...shake...nirvana. ( I like to old bay them up as well.
246 2018-08-17 23:22:32 Trying to use the Apple remote is akin to fucking a seal in an oil bath.
247 2018-08-17 23:22:30 Highly recommend the sally hansen insta dri polish its 3 dollars each bottle ! That’s the only nail polish that lasts on me but i clean my nails with a cotton ball with nail polish remover to remove the oil then i polish them and it stays put for a good time
248 2018-08-17 23:22:29 so coconut oil just makes my skin glow 
249 2018-08-17 23:22:19 I've tried the rub on oil, not taken internally. Rub on is like ben-gay. Does the oral CBD work, that you know of?

252 2018-08-17 23:21:47 Biggest night of my life  Lucas oil 8:30
253 2018-08-17 23:21:40 Friends who installed boilers operated on grain or straw have found w/ currents prices of feed/fodder it's like burning bank notes. IMO biomass/heat pumps are too complicated a set up for realistic practical domestic ease of use + supplier market is wild west snake oil territory
254 2018-08-17 23:21:20 (truly cannot tell if it’s like a character/costume decision or if they were just frantically dumping buckets of oil over his head to tone down the fact that he looks like he does)

256 2018-08-17 23:20:40 私の場合推しのグループ卒業や今後の兵役期間があったりするから色々と自分の興味対象を分散させてる感じだな笑 度がすぎるとなんかしんどくなるよね。今もEXO好きすぎて距離置くためにSHINee見てる← かおりたんもそろそろK-popに手出そうよ〜！茶の間で楽しめるよう〜！(定期的な勧誘)
257 2018-08-17 23:20:02 Man using oil paints is so risky, I swear I almost licked one because they look like melted chocolate smh
258 2018-08-17 23:20:00 Spot on. Why is SNP so bad when way ahead of UK Government re: worthwhile policies. Built significantly more social housing. Better NHS. World firsts that go unreported. Scotland greater inward investment than UK, greater growth, oil looking good. Guess that's all in the book?
259 2018-08-17 23:19:58 I don't think those are particularly bad (arguably unethically sourced palm oil is on animal welfare grounds though). However, we should be getting more nutrients from whole foods rather than (too much) isolated fats - especially the processed veg oils.
260 2018-08-17 23:19:34 There are an estimated 168 million dead trees in California. Kindling. Evergreens are oil based trees that produce sap that is highly flammable. The failure to manage evergreen forests properly IS environmental terrorism.

262 2018-08-17 23:19:25 I told papa I went and got my oil changed and brakes checked by myself and he was so happy that I did it . He knows I usually call him when I have any car problems so he’s proud of me.
263 2018-08-17 23:18:53 You know what’s better than food? Lying my head on a nigga’s chest and inhaling the scent from their neck. Anointing their back with frankincense and lavender oil as I tease out the day’s worries.
264 2018-08-17 23:18:41 Just bought cbd oil and am excited to see if it helps with everything 
265 2018-08-17 23:18:31 Ima need chuck to learn how to change oil... so he can do our cars and we can save money. Especially him
266 2018-08-17 23:18:30 drizzle of truffle oil
267 2018-08-17 23:18:25 Coconut oil is supposed to help with bruises! Feel better soon and take it easy!
268 2018-08-17 23:18:21 Totally...
We've transformed most of cocoa plantation to palm oil plantation. Sabah beans were one of the flavour rich beans.
269 2018-08-17 23:18:20 So your policies are based on having the North Sea Oil fields to pay for them? Your policies require about 97% homogeneous white nordic society? Maybe you should implement a monarchy like Norway.
270 2018-08-17 23:17:53 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
271 2018-08-17 23:17:44 I guess you're buying into the fake FOX make believe they're a news organization...
Trump is a con man
snake oil salesman from Queens NY..
A grifter..
Always was
Always will be.
272 2018-08-17 23:17:37 I got an essential oil diffuser and so I tested it out, not realizing how strong the essential oil was.... and now the whole house smells like lemons :-)
273 2018-08-17 23:17:36 Pretty generous with Alberta money. And protest the oil sands dafuq?
274 2018-08-17 23:17:32 Emu oil
275 2018-08-17 23:17:28 When you're more open to centuries-old hearsay than common sense/fact I can't listen. Not even for entertainment, it gets to be too much. Friends recommended Art Bell back in the day, I couldn't stand it. Snake oil and BS-mongering. And boring, to boot. Oh, well.
276 2018-08-17 23:17:17 You’re at the fork in the road. One choice takes you over a 100ft drop off, the other straight into a boiling cauldron of oil. Go for the drop off. Chose Trump!! You’ll learn to fly!
277 2018-08-17 23:17:15 Well, the onshore and offshore drilling from the foreign oil industry (at least 2 billion barrels already announced from Talos and ENI); pipelines from institutional investors; airports from the tourism sector. Refineries, though, they may have to stump up themselves.
278 2018-08-17 23:17:08 someone pls help me find a good CBD pen or oil i have no idea what i’m doing

283 2018-08-17 23:15:59 My tattoo artist advised not covering it and coconut oil, so that’s what I’ve been doing! Thanks though x
284 2018-08-17 23:15:42 Oo do they give more oil or something I’ve not had one yet but I’ve not done much fishing because I forgot to buy the fishing when I went out the first toon. Wasn’t keen on the price though

So much  geochem/clay change going on b4 greenschist met,can easily misinterpret results if think all "muds" are same.

289 2018-08-17 23:15:13 I think it looks like 1 for sure. Time to get some anointing oil and spray the door with it. Anointing oil is olive oil that has been prayed over, blessed and consecrated to God.

294 2018-08-17 23:14:55 You can halve them, cover in olive oil and salt/pepper/herbs, and roast in the oven! You can also make your own dried tomatoes to pack in your fave flavored oil! Roasted/dried tomatoes go great on bruschetta and pizza/flatbreads

298 2018-08-17 23:13:23 People critize #pei for not having jobs. I find there is lots of jobs available. Yes, there are some industries that are hard to find jobs in here (like oil) but at the same time there are lots of other oppurtunities for people to take up #urpei or self-employment which is

300 2018-08-17 23:13:00 Good article @Haje. I've had a similarly diverse set of occupations - from working on a barge, pipe fitter in oil refinery, an engineer building power plants, an engineer writing software to build power plants, to an entrepreneur. A common thread? Its the products! #prodmgmt
301 2018-08-17 23:12:51 The mumble sauce taste like water ketchup and canola oil. The wings still got feathers on em.. went once in desperation big regret

“You can fit 3 whole former departments in one of these bad boys”
303 2018-08-17 23:12:23 Solution seems to be a hot shower with an oil based cleanser. Don't waste your time trying to scrub it off over the sink. 
304 2018-08-17 23:12:18 Signing off for a bit to recharge with a rainy spa evening with the hubs.

Ready for some facemasks, oil massages and meditation 
305 2018-08-17 23:12:01 (Here is the part where I become informed)

Russia flooded the market.
OPEC did something.
Venezuela = oil as only resource.

CRISIS.
306 2018-08-17 23:12:00 @iAmNiyola does your hair smell like hot oil
307 2018-08-17 23:11:59 ...huh. I guess something in peanut oil does it
308 2018-08-17 23:11:51 I just bought a cool new NEW 3DS Oprah is actually an eagle wearing a big costume! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
309 2018-08-17 23:11:50 It's...shiny hair...wtf.

The use of oil to impart sheen has been around for thousands of years.
310 2018-08-17 23:11:38 @SarahSpain Happy Birthday from a huge fan in the Great White North and may your tRolls boil in hot oil.
311 2018-08-17 23:11:28 It was  Olive oil that used a rope to break the egg beater
312 2018-08-17 23:11:22 Yeah, no matter how you slice it, I just can't stop seeing a Snake Oil Salesman when I see you.
313 2018-08-17 23:11:06 Hmm, you could make what my mum would call 'chicken à la crème'; soften onions in oil/butter, add cubed chicken breast, then mushrooms; then madeira, optionally flambé, reduce; add cream or crème fraîche, season. Herbs optional (e.g. tarragon) Serve with rice/tagliatelle/potatoes
314 2018-08-17 23:10:55 Fuel scarcity but you claim to have Oil & Gas.
315 2018-08-17 23:10:53 There is nothing honorable or heroic about killing Iraqi children in the name of oil.

318 2018-08-17 23:10:43 I am an allocishet white dude, but the people who know are saying it's "sheen"/"oil sheen"?  All I know is this is in no way knew, and looks nothing like glass.
319 2018-08-17 23:10:40 I think the point is something showed to at unintended place. And no data in people on how glyphosate behaves
320 2018-08-17 23:10:23 No electricity but you claim to have Oil & Gas.
321 2018-08-17 23:10:19 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
322 2018-08-17 23:10:01 #ChrisWatts is deplorable, 33 year old alive Caucasian man that killed his pregnant wife and 2 children. Put the children in oil drums! There is no need fear ISIS, immigrants or MS13 America.
323 2018-08-17 23:09:57 Straight; Mango and jam mostly (at one point started using hash oil)
324 2018-08-17 23:09:51 And we buy their oil. They also attack us, pull students, yet we allow the oil shipments to continue and the weapons to ship there.
325 2018-08-17 23:09:48 In case anyone wonders its OGX Deep Penetrating Argan Oil. Actually swear by it.

328 2018-08-17 23:09:20 Haha! Class. I reckon 99.9% of REAL Utd fans want Leeds back in the Prem. Proper rivalry, oil free. I love cricket!!! Saw England at the Bridgetown Oval T20. A life high point.
329 2018-08-17 23:09:16 Propaganda Govt... Did this come after Fashola wasted time saying past Govt (Which he was a part of) didn't invest in Power Generation when there was oil windfall...

333 2018-08-17 23:08:42 Having worked for a premium brand I can tell you this for a fact. The more in it the worse for your skin. Natural is best&whatever works WORKS. I use hair oil on my skin as a cleanser and moisturiser. Very rarely have any skin issues. Told my beautician that, she nearly fainted.
334 2018-08-17 23:08:31 そんな感じ！毎日じゃないけど定期的に会う甥っ子姪っ子みたいな？昨日は久しぶりの刀ミュでまりおちゃん歌上手くなってて感動してた笑 そして明日はアンジュの握手会！
335 2018-08-17 23:08:22 There is a need for the energy. It's just that the energy could be generated more cleanly in the south where the is so much sunlight. Also it costs a fortune to pump oil all that way. It's dirty and inefficient.
336 2018-08-17 23:08:18 87 million in poverty yet you claim to have Oil.
337 2018-08-17 23:08:11 American snake oil salesmen like you pretending to be Christians are destroying Christianity all over the world! you are no pastor any man who gets rich from preaching while his flock starves & children are put in cages is doing the work of lucifer not god!

339 2018-08-17 23:08:08 250° 45 min to 60 min. Get some peanut butter, olive oil, anything high in fat. Decarb the buds and mix that shit in. It works well for me. I took one spoonful of peanut butter and I was high for a while.
340 2018-08-17 23:07:49 I need a oil change who got me ??
341 2018-08-17 23:07:43 The main component to #JohannaBudwig's #cancer protocol is #Flaxseed oil, one of the highest #Omega3-content foods.  #Budwig said she found #cholesterol to be the wrong type of fat for the body, and flaxseed oil had the right fat.  She blended it with no-fat cottage cheese...
342 2018-08-17 23:07:32 More lady mechanics please, so us little, gay boys can feel more comfortable getting our oil changed.
343 2018-08-17 23:07:28 Try tea tree oil once every 2 days, it helped dramatically on my face :)
344 2018-08-17 23:07:11 Every oil well drilled is another gang bang rape of #MotherEarth especially when #God gave us #Cannabis @legalizepotusa
345 2018-08-17 23:07:04 We are long time members for the same reason.  Glyphosate, clodinafop, clethodim, 2,4D, surfactant,  and lubricating oils are our big purchases.  I have many CAT SOS oil tests proving oil is fine. Have done whole TL fert in the past to keep the local guys honest.

363 2018-08-17 23:03:48 You can do coconut oil treatments like you would on your own hair. Just melt the coconut oil and massage it into the tail, really exfoliate the tail bone. Wash with shampoo and finish with conditioner:)

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
366 2018-08-17 23:03:15 because it is coming from Igbo land, they will never support it. The truth is that, these are some of the reasons why they dont want to give us BIAFRA because they are scared of what we will become with or without oil.. Proudly IGBO BOY...
367 2018-08-17 23:03:09 "alright now the oil change is gonna be an extra $50"
368 2018-08-17 23:02:57 It's as if they think ownership (read: private property) is bad.
369 2018-08-17 23:02:46 Now because it is coming from Igbo land, they will never support it. The truth is that, these are some of the reasons why they dont want to give us BIAFRA because they are scared of what we will become with or without oil.. Proudly IGBO BOY...
370 2018-08-17 23:02:45 1/2 This article states that oil pipelines are safe, but the quote you provide is an opinion. The facts show a much different reality: “Data collected from the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)...

375 2018-08-17 23:02:22 I used to eat red palm oil when I was a Loren Cordain-Mark Sisson type, paleo advocate.  I literally used to get chest pains. Coconut oil was more neutral, but when I switched to ghee, I had a real sense of post meal wellness. So I kicked those plant fats to the curb.

380 2018-08-17 23:01:45 go to the supermarket - food prices aren't factored into the economic numbers and inflation. Every time I go prices are increasing. Never thought 1lb of butter would cost $6.00 or one product could increase $7.00 (now 30 for a can of olive oil) in two weeks
381 2018-08-17 23:01:38 それわかるわ。今は息子と娘がたくさんいる感じ。過度なダイエットさせられてないかとか、事務所からのプレッシャーにストレス感じてないかとか健康と幸せを願う親の境地。

CBD oil (indica based) could help you relax and give a pleasant sleep without terrible side effects.

It's not psychoactive either, look into as we can't lose you to sleep deprivation!!

413 2018-08-17 22:55:51 Today’s been rough. Made my first car payment. Got rear ended leaving the credit union. Got an oil change, but I’m still waiting even though everyone after me already left. Had to go to four stores for engine enamel in a true red.

423 2018-08-17 22:53:30 Right, but this was one study. We have thousands and the only ones refuting MMCC are the ones funded by oil it seems.
So anti-MMCC seems to be the sugar industry here.

429 2018-08-17 22:52:15 Virtually all of it will be consumed by higher prices on goods from tariffs, and junk insurance plans from TrumpCare. Whatever is left is pennies a day, while corporations reap massive windfalls. We see right through you, snake oil salesman.
430 2018-08-17 22:52:10 if you bake your entire dinner on one sheet and everything tastes like olive oil and rosemary get out the kitchen.
431 2018-08-17 22:52:09 That sounds absolutely gorgeous! I love Argan Oil!
432 2018-08-17 22:52:06 I'm just not really into the fairy tale happily ever after stuff. Which is hilarious because I love fairy tales but like All Baba's brother getting drawn & quartered and the boiling oil and shit. They are more fun when they're gruesome.
433 2018-08-17 22:52:00 Breastmilk or coconut oil!
434 2018-08-17 22:51:37 @AriMelber tell the guest the picture is from the artist’s  view. I like it and it does look like her.  It’s not suppose to be an exact portrait of her. That would be in oil!
435 2018-08-17 22:51:35 Leah have you tried Full Extract Cannabis Oil (FECO) with THC? I’m in Spain and I know it’s not easy to access in some US states but I know a lady here who takes it for Fibromyalgia & it’s changed her world. Mostly pain alleviation & sleeping a full night. Worth investigating x

Btw. I also started practicing oil painting. Hope you don't mind if I try to paint some of your photographs, however it will be very hard for beginners...
445 2018-08-17 22:50:26 I will order that now because this is ridiculous  can I put makeup on over it? Two hours after I put on foundation I swear just touching my face will wipe it right off because it's like damp from oil

449 2018-08-17 22:50:02 @elonmusk As a shareholder and Model S owner, Thanks for all you have done. I understand the reasons for going private. Consider that the Saudi's would love to sell more oil. If they owned Tesla, they may not have the same vision that you have.
450 2018-08-17 22:49:59 Would love to, I'll bring the massage oil. 
451 2018-08-17 22:49:48 Ever since I started using castor oil on my beard it’s been feeling way better
452 2018-08-17 22:49:20 Ah yes..@DLoesch probably uses gun oil as anal lube while taking it from dirty old NRA members and the GOP.

＼It's OIL!!!／
454 2018-08-17 22:48:53 There are people who think that, but there are other ways. If we run out of one of the resources that accelerates technocapital development before the singularity, it won't happen.
If dysgenic trends lower the average intelligence of humanity, or if we run out of oil, etc
455 2018-08-17 22:48:52 Health tip - Black seed oil helps hair growth and is a great skin tonic.
456 2018-08-17 22:48:38 There's a long list of things we can do to end reliance on fossil fuels. The fact that you haven't even googled this issue speaks volumes about your insincerity here. Like the rest of the GOP, you will do exactly what the oil lobby demands.

467 2018-08-17 22:46:32 Lmao and for the rice sellers who give plenty oil and make you feel they give stew

471 2018-08-17 22:45:28 Scary notion that banning coal, smokeless coal and log burners is being proposed. What about those who are pretty secluded and don't have the option of gas and oil cannot reach them in winter when they're cut off. Horrible and dangerous idealism at play again!!! 1/2
472 2018-08-17 22:45:10 DID I HEAR OIL

476 2018-08-17 22:44:57 Grant Smith of Bloomberg @markets, in his article: "Oil set for longest losing run since 2015 amid economic fears" refers to "@realDonaldTrump's  trade spat with China." Spat? Really? Find ANYTHING not made in China. Fighting for trade equity & self-sufficiency isn't a spat.

479 2018-08-17 22:44:33 First of all no one here wants socialism. So what's your point? Second, Venezuela is in crisis because of Maduro's authoritarian and totalitarian policies, the fall in price of crude oil (their main export), and the undermining of the country’s democratic institutions.

492 2018-08-17 22:42:28 My point was that ALL your soaps make excellent shampoo bars esp. Vanilla Mint (coconut oil is unique in that it binds to the hair strand) & Brown Windsor (shea coats & noticeably softens hair well.)
493 2018-08-17 22:42:27 History thought us that the very first tribe to have pushed to secede from Nigeria are the North but since oil was discovered, they suddenly fell in love with the Country again and are willing to wipe out any tribe that opposes them in the name of sustaining One Nigeria. #History

523 2018-08-17 22:37:49 Is it mentally taxing hold those two very conflicting ideas in your head simultaneously, big Oil conspiring against Musk, and desperately wanting Big Oil to bail him out? Must be tough.
524 2018-08-17 22:37:46 @FlaDems ... @GwenGraham is just not tough enough for today’s politics (even though it will probably go back to more normal with the exit of Trump). She won’t stand up against Trump ... we need some who will ... otherwise... we WILL have oil wells off the Florida coast
525 2018-08-17 22:37:39 Unfortunately ppl like myself r getting caught up in it. I'm facing 18yrs jail 4 supplying FREE cannabis oil to ppl tht wer sick & dying. I saved kids wth inoperable brain tumours.. epilepsy, u name it. These ppl were desperate & hd no other options. Ther r no victims.
526 2018-08-17 22:37:35 If a cop tries to arrest you for being in possession of a hash oil vape pen you can make him hit it to prove that it is THC and when he gets high off it you can make a citizens arrest on him

534 2018-08-17 22:36:21 This is exactly why he's doing it. @realDonaldTrump thought we should have taken oil.  He doesn't care about war, or peace...he cares about money.

And he has the nerve to call anyone else crooked?
Wake up people.

543 2018-08-17 22:34:22 Whyyy does an oil change cost so much 
544 2018-08-17 22:33:57 Mayo made with real eggs, lemon and olive oil is great! It's that fake salad dressing stuff I object to.
545 2018-08-17 22:33:44 Sorry, I can't tell you, but I'm as outraged as you are over the cost of olive oil. 
546 2018-08-17 22:33:40 My guess is it's probably an ISX15, probably about 600hp, 2050 lbft tq. Oil capacity could be between 36 and 44 qts. Just a guess

Hold her in your arms.
558 2018-08-17 22:31:30 @NBCNews you all really need to get on this situation in Florida .. worse than an oil spill

561 2018-08-17 22:31:11 Hell yeah. I need a massage after that intense workout.  Rub me down with oil.
562 2018-08-17 22:31:06 Alaskans own 107,808 shares of PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES CO, worth $20,077,084. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.
563 2018-08-17 22:30:45 Glass hair?! It’s just oil sheen! Thought they discovered something. 
564 2018-08-17 22:30:45 His job is to apply oil on the sisters
565 2018-08-17 22:30:36 I’m an acquired taste, like cod liver oil.
566 2018-08-17 22:30:36 he shoulda given that oil to the good  ol' u-s-of-a! nato would watch out for the people, who needs social services? after all, the west is all about "human rights"

569 2018-08-17 22:30:27 My black isle primary school may have been an anomaly in the 80s but we learned about the clearances and all went to see "the Cheviot, the stag, and the black black oil" on a school trip.
570 2018-08-17 22:30:24 How to dose Hemp oil.

1. Everyone has different genetic and biochemical makeup. Therefore, it is greatly advise to start with a lower dose and increase gradually to achieve the desired effect. #healthylife #curebiotic #pureultrahemp #healthyliving #goodhealth #hemp #hempoil

575 2018-08-17 22:28:38 This mango lime scalp oil got my shit spicy.
576 2018-08-17 22:28:31 overheard today while waiting to get an oil change: “air conditioning is underrated”
577 2018-08-17 22:28:28 Yeah, I highly recommend cooking it. I like to wilt a whole bunch of it in a pan with a bit of olive oil then crack some eggs on top and put the lid on to let them steam until sunny side until consistency. Perfect healthy breakfast.
578 2018-08-17 22:28:20 Remember when MV Queen of the North sank in the Inside Passage putting hundreds of lives at risk and spilling 1000’s of litres of fuel? Let’s halt all boat traffic in our precious coastal areas, starting with the ferris and fuel barges carrying oil and gas to Vancouver Island.
579 2018-08-17 22:28:19 you know how the game go.  niggas think they slick to a can of oil
580 2018-08-17 22:28:05 Yes. I used some cooking oil to give it a little crunch
581 2018-08-17 22:27:55 What?
582 2018-08-17 22:27:55 Rain Forests work better than Palm Oil Plantations at mitigating this type of disaster @Kemlu_RI Why did no one warn you?
583 2018-08-17 22:27:43 How do you use that oil moisturizer black chick?
584 2018-08-17 22:27:36 I wish I had the $ to start some low leverage longs on commodities (silver and oil). Both look like excellent buys. Oil touching the 200-MDA and Silver well below its yearly low. Patiently build these longs and they will pay off massively in 6-12 months. $slv $wti $oil

587 2018-08-17 22:27:26 Again you’re bowing down to Trump’s bullshit.
Look at the trends. Look at the data.
You don’t ignore science because oil is profitable (BTW, we’re going to run out in about 50 years).
588 2018-08-17 22:27:13 My reply was to Tim on food and medicines , regarding chemicals and been a retired engineer the American standards are excellent . I do not imply EU standards are poor though . Nearly all EU oil and gas regs are based on API ( American petroleum institute )

590 2018-08-17 22:26:39 @IndraNooyi Indra, why is @pepsi still decimating orangutans with their palm oil practices? What are you personally doing about it? #Extinct
591 2018-08-17 22:26:33 A lot lol 
Actually...
Daytime- exfoliating cleanser, Thayer’s toner, gel moisturizer with a drop of coconut oil. 

Nighttime- baking soda cleanser, toner, coconut oil all over mah face. 

LOTS OF WATER 

Currently looking for new cleansers tho.
592 2018-08-17 22:26:26 They got caught shipping oil as well.
593 2018-08-17 22:25:39 Children with conditions that require cannabis medicine do not smoke the flower of the plant - they consume cannabinoid extracts in oil form, for the most part, or sometimes other types of extracts. Not even vaporized flower or oil. This is child abuse.
594 2018-08-17 22:25:15 shaved my facial hair off .. gonna start fresh and try this beard oil out
595 2018-08-17 22:24:56 I always know its too hot out when my coconut oil is liquid form lol

597 2018-08-17 22:24:40 Omg I was telling that to someone yesterday! They were all proud of Starbucks and I pointed out that the cups and lids are still plastic...but yeah let’s focus on the straws to save the oceans and not the billions of gallons of oil dumped into the oceans by big oil
598 2018-08-17 22:24:37 He will cycle up a ramp in to the back of a lorry and the doors will close and the lorry okay it was filled with food bound for a ship bound for an oil rig and it’ll be months before he sees his loved ones again. I betcha.
599 2018-08-17 22:24:10 There was considerable tight oil overspend last quarter. Producer commentary included OFS inflation, labor, steel, non-op activity, etc. I'm really digging into Permian OFS inflation. What D&C components do you think will see the largest price rises by 2019?
600 2018-08-17 22:24:09 Oil prices have increased but until they are 90+ they will have no influence on our dollar.

602 2018-08-17 22:24:04 Why didn't she have Daddies alleged eastern block oil thugs to pay for the wedding!
603 2018-08-17 22:24:01 She grabs a big cast iron skillet and pours some olive oil and a little butter in it. She put the onion slices in it and sprinkles it with salt and ground pepper. Placing it on the heat.
604 2018-08-17 22:23:51 got my oil charge , a new stater & battery for my car & A FULL TANK! No better feeling
605 2018-08-17 22:23:22 Let’s be honest here: nobody gives a monkey about your country (except Israel recently).
You are merely taken into account because you export oil and terrorism.
Sad and simple truth.
606 2018-08-17 22:23:14 Most mayo is made from soybean oil its disgusting.
607 2018-08-17 22:23:07 This country needs oil and gas and coal, its 2018 and we don't want to be sent back to days of horse and cart. There is no viable alternatives yet
608 2018-08-17 22:23:06 do you think most of the folks fighting in Iraq had shares in oil companies?

35% of southern whites owned at least one slave.

The rest fought for it likely for the same reason non-wealthy today don't support estate tax or higher taxes on the 1% or even .1%
609 2018-08-17 22:23:01 Musing: did the breakup of J.D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil 'decentralize' the oil and gas industry?
610 2018-08-17 22:22:47 So sorry to hear that. Had a few patients who used cannabis oil. Made them very drowsy and helped pain but didn’t seem to help lymphoma. Personally I wouldn’t advise it. Do hope current treatment does what is needed and a donor is found.
611 2018-08-17 22:22:29 Poor millennials
612 2018-08-17 22:22:20 90% of the NFL?  You're a joke buddy. At least you found something to bitch about though! Monthly oil change time?

614 2018-08-17 22:22:15 dead ass... i was trying to put on chapstick while i’m driving down the road and i opened it and it poured out like oil!! all over my lap
615 2018-08-17 22:22:01 The UN hates Israel and the Jews. Votes are bought for barrels of oil by nations in the Arab bloc trying to pursue their agenda. Terrorists funded by Arab oil money pay out terrorist suicide bombers families.They outnumber Israel more than 10 to 1 but G-d is not on their side.
616 2018-08-17 22:21:58 Sounds like the Nicolás Maduro story, just sub in bus driver for snow plow and make him president of an oil rich, South American country. Samsies.
617 2018-08-17 22:21:58 The amount must be more. The Norwegian fund is nearly a trillion $ and they have had similar oil and gas than U.K.
618 2018-08-17 22:21:53 London friends - where can I find cbd oil??
619 2018-08-17 22:21:52 Frogs and toads are the same animal! They just shapeshift!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
620 2018-08-17 22:21:24 And re:friendly Islamic countries, the Middle East modern nations are largely constructs of Western Europe after demise of Ottoman Empire and carve up post WW1 at Paris Peace conference. West pursuit of oil and creation of modern state of Israel has caused chaos, terror and death

643 2018-08-17 22:17:23 It's the last desperate gasp of the MSM sponsored by the oil industry and car industry to try and destroy Elon. The stock price is still only where it was before the Q2 results and the infamous tweet. Still under priced. Screw the market. Let's go private.

672 2018-08-17 22:13:39 How do you think America became a FWC?? Trade. By having other FWC invest in its infrastructure, technology, and resources. Venezuela doesn’t have open trade, yet have one of the largest resources of oil in the world. They’re also socialist and have a terrible GDP compared to FWC

682 2018-08-17 22:12:23 It is and it can make many people want to die as their lives are just pain. Why don’t we have more options for pain. NSAIDS and opiates is about it for severe pain. 
Anyone using marijuana for pain, if yes what kind? CBD oil been helping but need bit of THC to relax.Tighten =pain
683 2018-08-17 22:12:17 what if you boil them till they just soften, then dress them in olive oil and sea salt and pop them in a 500 degree oven for 20 minutes, and then dress them with fresh herbs?
684 2018-08-17 22:12:15 The weird thing about this arguement is that there are people living off grid with renewable energy NOW! The problem is that successive Liberal and Labour governments have been too slow to transition Aus. to renewables. They are wedded to big coal and big oil to fund their chaos.
685 2018-08-17 22:12:10 I’m really about to fall asleep while I get my oil change 
686 2018-08-17 22:12:00 Very little improvement in Alberta. The employment numbers are awful. 
Many "oil" companies produce high % of Natural Gas and those prices are in the tank.
687 2018-08-17 22:11:25 Could any of this damage go back to the massive oil spill? I forget what year. 2009 or so? I never believed that all the oil & dispersants could disappear with no consequences 
688 2018-08-17 22:11:14 Any places in Stillwater that do AFFORDABLE oil changes? Y’all know they be over charging EVERYTHING down there. lol

Always infused with love and good intentions.

713 2018-08-17 22:07:28 Second the cbd oil, helped Daisy a ton! Also swaddling if the cat will let you, if they're harness trained at all sometimes just wearing it around the house helps too :)

724 2018-08-17 22:05:37 Our troops are already oil company mercenaries.
725 2018-08-17 22:05:34 Are you getting oil all over the couch?
726 2018-08-17 22:05:21 Our oil is good for the country but because of the lack of pipelines are oil ios discounted by $20. to $30. per barrel.  This is insane.  Wake up you politicians.
727 2018-08-17 22:05:07 Cannabis oil stops epilepsy. Somethin up wit yo brain? EAT the the Rick Simpson Oil (method of getting the oils urself). If u smoke it, u get 20% benefits. If u eat it, ur body gets 80% benefit! LET'S GO! OUR BODIES WERE DESIGNED TO EAT HERBS NOT CUPCAKES. BE LIKE GORILLA NO MEAT
728 2018-08-17 22:04:56 I'm into oil fam. I need dat shit
729 2018-08-17 22:04:43 Somehow I doubt Alberta would be very happy if he somehow could have prevented world oil prices from going up and did so.
730 2018-08-17 22:04:39 And rising oil prices are improving economies in Alberta and Saskatchewan. How awful is that?
731 2018-08-17 22:04:33 Free oil change and a free car wash, thank you @Toyota!! #WINNING!
732 2018-08-17 22:04:15 @ReliableToyota why is everyone working in your service department so attractive? I need to start dressing up to get my oil changed...
733 2018-08-17 22:04:02 (Measurements not exact as made on the hoof) Blend in a food processor: 400g hake or other fish, 100g cooked prawns, small onion, 2tsp Thai red curry paste, 1 egg, chopped coriander, 1tsp fish sauce. Form into small balls & fry (I use coconut oil).
734 2018-08-17 22:03:50 Norway gets 70% of their government funds from oil royalties. Is she suggesting massive oil industry expansion ?
735 2018-08-17 22:03:40 Most of the men (and women) who die(d) in the Middle East don’t own stock in oil industry but here we are.
736 2018-08-17 22:03:40 i take CBD oil it’s really just for the medicinal benefits of marijuana though it doesn’t get you high
737 2018-08-17 22:03:38 Very sad but we did it for years here with basking sharks, to use the oil they produced to light street lamps around the country.
738 2018-08-17 22:03:05 Does anybody know much about CBD oil??? hmu
739 2018-08-17 22:03:04 How’s that Olive oil working out for you @CharMAINE_EVENT

741 2018-08-17 22:02:49 Read the history of modern Iran and how western powers manipulated it, all for oil, resulting in the overthrow of a democratically elected secular leader by the western- backed Shah (which ushered in the Islamic revolution)

748 2018-08-17 22:02:06 Opinion)If I was governor of California, after they put fires out, I would request legislation be passed to run a pipeline not oil but water from North Cal. to South Cal, made to put out fires across that whole State. We believe each year will get hotter which means more fires
749 2018-08-17 22:02:01 In my house alone for the first time in months. I lit up every smelly candle, oil fragrance thing I could find. 42 minutes of bliss here for me now.
750 2018-08-17 22:01:54 You can do them all! Add oil!
751 2018-08-17 22:01:51 Yeah. I mean we do still sell them billions I military equipment and buy their oil but we did comment disapprovingly..which is our version of an air strike.
752 2018-08-17 22:01:45 Oil
753 2018-08-17 22:01:42 All week I’ve not thought about anything but not having to set my alarm for Saturday morning. I’m going to sleep all day, have my phone on DND and then when I eventually wake up I’m going to soak my hair in coconut oil and just laze around in my pjs all day. Fucking bliss mate.
754 2018-08-17 22:01:36 Every time I tried to use my easel today they fell out laughing and yelled no tocas. 
Yesterday I explained how the oil on our fingers ruins whiteboards so they’ve been really watching me 
755 2018-08-17 22:01:20 Man I love crude oil
756 2018-08-17 22:01:14 Waiting an hour and a half for an oil change....
757 2018-08-17 22:00:58 the guy at the oil change place hit on me & my dense ass didnt even notice at first hhh

he asked for my name & number since, y’know, they do that. i gave it, then he said “can i call you anytime?” & i said “yeah!” bc i thought he was asking if that’s the number i use the most i-
758 2018-08-17 22:00:56 Didn’t appear to impact on a whole host of other, non-Socialist countries, whose main revenue source is oil! In any case the oil price is now more than double the “crash” price and millions are still fleeing!
759 2018-08-17 22:00:43 We can not allow 10 backbenchers to confiscate climate and energy policy after 10 years of confiscation.
The LNP is in disarray.
The squeaky wheel is getting the oil.
They are not governing for the people, they are only interested in their own personal gain.
760 2018-08-17 22:00:22 Here is some Iraqi currency (Dinars) from the Central Bank of Iraq. Also there is currency from the Saudia Arabian Monetary Agency (Riyals). 

Notice the coinage includes depictions of oil refineries from the UAE (United Arab Emirates).

762 2018-08-17 21:59:54 Has she tried cannabis? Many cases like this have been turned around by using Rick Simpson Oil and high THC products (I'm Medical Cannabis Consultant)
763 2018-08-17 21:59:49 If vegetable oil is made of vegetables then is baby oil made out off...
764 2018-08-17 21:59:30 The oil wouldn't really make a difference to the rising. This guy's an idiot. You're usually meant to put the yeast into warm water and put some sugar into it to activate it. That improves fermentation speed.
765 2018-08-17 21:59:22 I bet people on oil rigs feel well smug every time they start up a DVD and see the message specifically telling them they're not allowed to watch it.
766 2018-08-17 21:59:11 My fantasy...a spare weekend...baby oil and a hotel room for is both
767 2018-08-17 21:58:51 Sitting outside watching my dog while oil pulling and doing a face mask is my aesthetic
768 2018-08-17 21:58:48 Thanks @_Tinxie people keep talking about tea tree oil. It’s either that or the Dr.
769 2018-08-17 21:58:40 What has happened to legalising medicinal cannabis and cannabis oil?
770 2018-08-17 21:58:18 Saw a Jim Jefferies sketch about a weather report being sponsored by an oil company LOL.
771 2018-08-17 21:58:16 Sweetie, you’re either a bot or a have an astounding ability to delude yourself. All of his products have been made overseas. He’s using this as a talking point to get you to think he cares about you. He’s a salesman and a conman. You’re buying the snake oil, made in China.
772 2018-08-17 21:58:02 I'm just afraid for the future economy sha. Like how will Nigerians survive when the population becomes 400M and the oil diminishes in value?
773 2018-08-17 21:58:01 Welding manager for an oil company 
774 2018-08-17 21:57:30 I've been considering the idea of painting several pieces (canvas, oil) about anorexia purgativa, but more into the abstract/modernist side.
Idk, does it sound dumb? And if I did would yall want to see?
775 2018-08-17 21:57:05 i feel like if you deleted the oil; paint from the faces it would be better
776 2018-08-17 21:57:04 Yo there’s this girl I used to have gifted honors classes with in high school in my oil painting class. I look totally different from high school (tattoos, booty shorts, hot af) and she’s the polar opposite of me (intellectual horse girl). Shit’s lit.
777 2018-08-17 21:56:48 Believe this is to live a simple and happy life
778 2018-08-17 21:56:43 I don't like to get the government involved unless completely necessary, but with the abject censorship of conservatives and libertarians on all social media platforms, it's time. 

Standard Oil was broken up for having less a monopoly.
779 2018-08-17 21:56:41 Morning dose of CBD oil helps my grandma soooo much!
780 2018-08-17 21:56:29 Is there oil, also?
781 2018-08-17 21:55:56 The cities and some county towns have mains gas out the country it's gas by tank or oil or solid fuel. We have a dual oil and log boiler system. If you have ready access to timber its yet only man. Ironically the green high tech pellet boilers are one of the most expensive to run
782 2018-08-17 21:55:52 It sure seems that way. Its a big oil field and whenever ISIS would capture an oil derrick they would release a message implying they captured the entire oil field.
783 2018-08-17 21:55:48 If it saves one child ...... the government that can save your child from snake oil is the government that can send him to die for some ephemeral foreign policy objective.
784 2018-08-17 21:55:48 On the bright side,, less oil on streets from leaks! lol
785 2018-08-17 21:55:47 I feel like chili oil is a fantastic condiment that we don't talk about enough
786 2018-08-17 21:55:45 Would you prefer we truck oil and gas?
787 2018-08-17 21:55:38 i slipped in the dirty snack bar oil they were changing at work so that's how my day is doing
788 2018-08-17 21:55:36 Snake oil, just like the propaganda you sell consumers about how great your monopolistic ISP favoring policies are when they in fact just deepen corporate profits at the consumers expense. #News #AlternativeFacts #fightfortheftr #Corrupt #Shill #NetNeutrality⁠ #Traitor
789 2018-08-17 21:55:30 Anything for more green spaces. Not sure I’d want to eat those tomatoes though. Leaking oil and gas fumes??
790 2018-08-17 21:55:19 I hear you.  

It pisses me off how it has been portrayed as such a scourge and rat holed for so long when science shows that it could actually have healing properties. 

You may check in to availability to CBD oil in TX.
791 2018-08-17 21:55:19 Don’t ever go to Pepboys for an oil change even if you get a 20 dollar discount in the mail they will price gouge the shit out of you.
792 2018-08-17 21:55:09 Spray some WD40 on top and they will die (the mini oil slick stops them breathing)
793 2018-08-17 21:55:07 Actually, the journey to meaningful development in this country, will only start when oil runs dry. Right now there is too much money to be stolen from crude, there is no incentive to think, plan and do the right things.
794 2018-08-17 21:55:02 - brush them
- massage eye lids
- avoid using fake lashes (the glue can be bad for your lashes)
- olive oil
- vaseline
- aloe vera
- jojoba oil
- coconut oil
- vitamin e
795 2018-08-17 21:54:56 More of healthy fats like avocados, coconut, nuts, and olive oil together with more protein makes you full longer.
796 2018-08-17 21:54:38 Good news for our aerospace workers of Oklahoma. Little know fact, aerospace rivals oil for employment and GDP in Oklahoma. Now please do something to help stem the flow of outsourcing from the Tulsa maintenance facility! Our families are counting on you!
797 2018-08-17 21:54:30 my mom randomly ordered us some CBD oil lol
798 2018-08-17 21:54:28 I'm not sure about #RifeMachines of today.  I will say this -- I've read comments online about using a #Rife machine in combination with #flaxseed oil.  Notice I used a #ZAPPER, not a Rife machine, in my protocol.  And it is my protocol that started that.  More on this later...
799 2018-08-17 21:54:13 The bubble-point pressure is simply the level at which gas comes out of solution e.g. 100 C is bubble point for water at  atm press. Says nothing about amnt of reservoir energy available to drive oil to surface.
800 2018-08-17 21:54:00 One Nation Under Siege!  Eric Prince, brother of Nancy Devoss, once again wants 2 talk 2 #45 abt. allowing his company of mercenaries 2 take over in Afghanistan. 4 all da work they'll do, he WANTS Afgani OIL FIELDS as paymt. R we like Saddam Hussein? SHOCKING! Da devil is busy!!!
801 2018-08-17 21:53:46 Real tempted to take these braids down just to do a hot oil treatment and mask
802 2018-08-17 21:53:17 Why is Saudi Arabia, a country which wouldn't exist without it's oil wealth, buying stake in Tesla, a company which would like to make oil more or less redundant? Is Saudi Arabia hedging it's bets? Or is it some nefarious plan to derail electric vehicles?
803 2018-08-17 21:53:15 Don't think I'll ever grow a long beard again. Too bad all that beard oil is gonna go to waste  #hipsteroil
804 2018-08-17 21:53:11 At the Silicon Valley Open I drove up in my newly reconditioned and repaired jauty at the local repair store and it became quite clear that I was dripping oil all over my Zapata Oil Drilling Services personnel book and yet in the future this would be my recovery to hell and back.
805 2018-08-17 21:53:08 Scott are they going to include oil imported from offshore in to eastern Canada
806 2018-08-17 21:52:52 @realDonaldTrump $96 million won't even buy you an oil change for your bouffant, Spanky. In Paul Manafort's wing of the GOP Deep State, it costs that much to watch dogs fuck.

Imo = Itchy minge oil
811 2018-08-17 21:51:58 Good olive oil and salt, maybe some slow roasted garlic?
812 2018-08-17 21:51:39 Sooo, shipping the oil by rail car is the better option?..  Why does Venezuela come to mind every time I see something regarding Bernie Sanders?   Everyone there is starving for food while gorging on all that free communist ideology.  Well, everyone except for the politicians...
813 2018-08-17 21:51:35 Not to mention the situation in Venezuela is all falsified propaganda to demonize Maduro and socialism, to give an excuse to push for unjust regime change in the country with the richest oil reserves in the world. Actual reporting out of Venezuala has shown as much. MSM lies.

816 2018-08-17 21:51:13 Only my life changing fucking oil is legit impossible
817 2018-08-17 21:51:10 Physical barrier will wall off Texans, municipal water supply, oil and gas wells, gas lines on same side as cartels. Texans pay lots of taxes to DC for wall & giving away 1.5 million acres - accomplishing what General Santa Ana couldn’t. Technology + more agents better way.
818 2018-08-17 21:51:06 Firstly it’s not oil, it’s a mix of propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin, both of which are present in foods. Secondly, they are not “smoking” it. There is no smoke, it’s vapor. Big difference.
819 2018-08-17 21:50:55 40 years ago we were saving the planet from global cooling and running out of oil. Read your own newspaper. Did you do such a good job of stopping it that YOU created global warming? Nuclear winter is the only known way we can cool the planet, I suppose that is your ultimate goal
820 2018-08-17 21:50:55 God has blessed us to see another day filled with new mercies. Is it well with you?  Have you any oil?  Are you saved?

See that you punted MacEwan U Hockey School, next Friday for the Oil Kings. Don't recall you investing any $ in that rink. Mac U put $3M in. @donivson how did this happen? #yeg
829 2018-08-17 21:48:54 haha, well, my definition of pasta salad is "cold pasta with some kind of dressing on it and stuff mixed in", I consider it more of a category rather than a specific preparation. Is the mayo one of the problems? Because I just use a quick oil-and-vinegar dressing on mine.
830 2018-08-17 21:48:49 It's called "Transfer of Wealth".The world occasionally goes thru major wealth transfers-caused by Sugar wealth+slavery, Cotton wealth+slavery, Industrialization, Oil wealth+OPEC, Computer tech, & DRUGS. Illicit drugs are leveling the playing field btwn the "haves and have-nots"
831 2018-08-17 21:48:37 Maurice Strong drafted #Agenda21. Eco-"utopia" drenched in totalitarian mesures, eugenism and all. He was a socialist who commited fraud during the Food for Oil scandal in 95. Fled to China. Tells much.
832 2018-08-17 21:48:32 They like war! Who started the wars? The purpose of war with previous regimes was making money. Don't kill ISIS out keep them going means more money. Bush in oil and GAS for example. They stage the wars. They want WW3. Including NK/RUSSIA/IRAN/IRAQ their pawns.
833 2018-08-17 21:48:29 It's cherry picking things to Denmark's ability to generate income

One could do the same w the US

(If Russia hadn't worn down Germany in the west we'd have spent more, if we didn't have the luck of domestic oil/gas and peaceful neighbors.....)

843 2018-08-17 21:47:37 Madison's drop volley was completely godawful atrocious and yet Billie could cure any any bad motion and still Jenn was going to the Open without or without a used "oil can".
844 2018-08-17 21:47:33 "Someone you want to bathe in a hot pot of oil" 
845 2018-08-17 21:47:27 We have oil central heating, and a coal fire. But I wouldn't want to just rely on the oil central heating. Next door only have coal fires. Apart from coal fires or log burners it's all heating oil here.
846 2018-08-17 21:47:05 Let’s hope Assad’s forces crush the rebel’s and further embarrass the US, UK et al. Their war for oil, central banks and land is pure greed and a disgrace to humanity. As is current MSM. @georgegalloway This is another unacceptable war. Assad not perfect but our leaders are worse
847 2018-08-17 21:46:57 Said the money changer as he sold his snake oil.
848 2018-08-17 21:46:52 Need a documentary on Man Utd winning the double in 08... Pep won a mickey mouse trophy and one league title and gets a documentary?  Win a CL with city before he should get one but money talks.  Pep and City have oil money.  Dirty dirty oil money
849 2018-08-17 21:46:43 Oil in the living room, incense in the bathroom, candle in the bedroom. Judge your mother...
850 2018-08-17 21:46:40 A b.b./ c.c. Cream that is SWEAT AND OIL PROOF!
851 2018-08-17 21:46:36 Maddy refused to be interviewed any more about bad "press" interviews and then the story of Zapata Oil Drilling Services reared its ugly head and Jenn was all "ears". Drip drip drip.
852 2018-08-17 21:46:32 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
853 2018-08-17 21:46:30 Got an oil change at Brake Masters, was about to pay and they said it was on them. Whaaaaatt.
854 2018-08-17 21:46:18 @WeeMissBea found CBD oil from Planet Organic very effective in treating her insomnia. Expensive though but might be worth a try. Sorry you’re suffering with it.
855 2018-08-17 21:46:18 We Grow BC received a production license for fresh/oil, not a cultivation license. Experion's sales license is only for B2B sales of dried cannabis.
856 2018-08-17 21:46:14 We learn something new every day. I've only just learnt that I need to oil (Or WD40) at the bottom of my tiller. Always learning. Been on my narrowboat for 3 years, might now "clean" my water tank too soon. Thanks for the share. Experiences help. Good luck. :-)

864 2018-08-17 21:45:14 I think their desire to hold Hillary/Obama accountable for things they "got away with" became all consuming. They put in their own truth-twisting dealer (who whispered sweet nothings in their ears about muslims, illegals, pc culture), but turns out he's in the snake oil biz.

868 2018-08-17 21:44:41 This is poor journalism making an attempt at sensationalism, they need to diversify their economy away from oil and gas. Should have been done ages ago
869 2018-08-17 21:44:23 Tesla is scaring the crap out of the motor city, big oil.
 Elon, get some rest and keep fighting the good fight.
870 2018-08-17 21:44:19 Took my car in to get an oil change and it didn't come back with any other issues...so you could say today is a pretty good day.

872 2018-08-17 21:44:13 I'm angrier at the tax that serves the public good than I am at the obvious gouging from my friends in the oil industry.

875 2018-08-17 21:43:33 I tried that at the dealership where I had my car’s oil changed and got nowhere once but next time I’ll b pushier and if they’d had XXX on I’d have had a fit and gotten it done the first time omg
876 2018-08-17 21:43:31 Or an oil 
877 2018-08-17 21:43:29 Any fat in liquid form when consumed.
Melted butter, heavy cream (it is on the list in case it's needed but hoping not to use as I said), coconut oil, mct oil, melted bacon grease, avocado oil, olive oil, macadamia oil, etc
I'm sure there are more I'm not thinking of.
878 2018-08-17 21:43:28 Coconut oil is high in lauric acid and a naturally antiviral, antibacterial & antifungal food. Add 1-2 Tbsp. to your daily Green Smoothie!

880 2018-08-17 21:43:12 Im pissed off because the sticker jiffy lube gave me said i had until 38,000 until i needed another oil change.... my maintenance light is on at 36,000.. scam
881 2018-08-17 21:43:10 I only realised when I went to work for Energy Saving Trust (in 2001) that Ireland has no gas supply. Cities have Community Energy schemes, but otherwise mostly reliant on oil and electricity. Is that still the case?

885 2018-08-17 21:42:45 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
886 2018-08-17 21:42:45 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
887 2018-08-17 21:42:36 Trump used to be a dem so of course that would’ve been his opinion in 2004. Also, you won’t really notice the tax cut until u do ur taxes in early ‘19. They apply for the 2018 tax year. Trump asked Saudi Arabia to increase oil production to lower the price. It should stabilize
888 2018-08-17 21:42:35 We were with you until that last word... had we been gamblers we'd have put any money on that word being OIL!

Zionism, particularly white Christian Zionism, may be a by-product of the West's greed for oil. After all Israel is very handy strategic land for imperial forces.
889 2018-08-17 21:42:30 Did my oil change for next week

894 2018-08-17 21:42:16 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
895 2018-08-17 21:42:11 Thank you for this. We need more pouring oil.

899 2018-08-17 21:41:59 Hey #Denver, you think the increase in population is bad now, wait until people start fleeing coastal cities because the ocean is rising because of all the damn oil and gas we're burning. This is nothing. 
Start building places that can survive without cars now, or be fucked soon
900 2018-08-17 21:41:56 The Venezuela! Cry is the cry of the economic illiterate. Someone who has no clue about the worlds monetary systems or denies the clear influence that US oil oligarchs have over US foreign policy.

903 2018-08-17 21:41:08 You are a test for America. Watch how fast things you have done will be reversed when you are voted out in 2020. Believe it or not, there are more intelligent people in the US than fools who believed in your snake oil salesmanship. You have stirred up the left like never before!

905 2018-08-17 21:40:38 I asked the mechanic changing my vehicle’s engine oil to remove the dead birds from my grill and that’s why I don’t change it myself.

908 2018-08-17 21:40:28 "my actual policies are more reminiscent of Norway"
Your actual policies are the discovery of a previously-unknown enormous amount of oil in the US?

914 2018-08-17 21:39:26 I’m due for an oil change, but I don’t wanna pay 
915 2018-08-17 21:39:24 Actually take a look at your policies and you’ll see they are much closer to Venezuela because Norway isn’t socialist it just has high social spending that it can barely afford because of its oil industry and population of 5.5 million people
916 2018-08-17 21:39:23 They sure complained like they lost, but in reality they just got their feelings hurt and threw a tantrum. Meanwhile, corrupt, crony, corporate, Casio Capitalists paid everyone on TV and radio to spread propaganda favorable to war, oil, pharma, banks, AMZN, APPL, GOOG, FB, etc.

924 2018-08-17 21:38:36 I was supposed to get my oil changed about 3,000 miles ago.... oops
925 2018-08-17 21:38:29 @Swamy39 
Are these reasons for Rs value not going up
1) Too much dependence on global oil imports
2) Foreign investments on unnecessary goods which India can very well produce it
3) Allowing butterfly capital
4) Indians taking Foreign dollar loans due to less interest rates.
926 2018-08-17 21:38:21 MA says 
If the USA keeps the sanctions in #Iran as in November.. evil trump administration going to Iran oil exports what you think what will happen and what’s the Eu role in the case ?

929 2018-08-17 21:38:07 armies need oil.
transport/aircraft/cargo/jets/tanks can't run on renewables.
corporations/oligarchs can't make enough $$$$$$ w/ renewables.
930 2018-08-17 21:37:56 Pipelines are proven safer than trains, boats and trucks. So unless you convince everyone to stop using oil, you need to stop lying about pipelines to get votes

938 2018-08-17 21:36:45 I’m a veteran USAF officer and I protest military deployment when it is dubious or illegal. Started protesting as a child in Germany against the Vietnam war; again when military used as an oil baron tool by Bush. R u a chickenhawk? Do tell us about your service.

943 2018-08-17 21:36:27 I'd keep an eye on $NEPT as well.  Isolating compounds is way above my pay grade but apparently their experience with Krill oil out of the antarctic will serve them well in extracting oil at scale ready for human consumption. With all that money, might make sense for $WEED to buy

Outstanding.  Classic.
945 2018-08-17 21:36:14 I used to do it on my kid’s heavily stained/grass-stained clothes...only thing that worked, I think because it is oil based

951 2018-08-17 21:35:11 ‘One of us’??? You mean silver spoon, hypocritical, snake oil salesmen?
952 2018-08-17 21:35:05 Maybe.  We produce quite a bit more oil domestically  now.
953 2018-08-17 21:34:58 My view? Exactly what empire. America is not a colonist country  unless the The USA itself and not so successful at running that? Any thing else is a proxy take over using military might and stealing ( Syrian oil and even proxys do this) It fails to govern or is not capable of
954 2018-08-17 21:34:56 @bulletproofexec I am currently using the Bulletproof Collagen Protein, Brain octane oil, collagen protein bars and coconut charcoal and love how I feel.        Just got Unfair Advantage and KetoPrime today. What is the best way to use those two new additions in the same day?
955 2018-08-17 21:34:44 the most annoying thing to me for the past week has been the fact that Babylon sounded perfect in Lucas Oil, but on the stream, the solo mics were disabled, and it literally killed the hits and I'm just really sad that my feelings weren't resolved after hearing it
956 2018-08-17 21:34:37 I must admit that I'm guilty of using oil occasionally, but I do eat whole food plant based the majority of the time. These are the best cholesterol readings I've had in a years. I also have the hereditary high cholesterol, which I just found out May 2018.
957 2018-08-17 21:34:33 What overuse?

Why do you insist on using vague terms when your told to be outraged about something.

"Our over use of oil."  How do you know we're "over using" it?  What's the right amount?
958 2018-08-17 21:34:23 m.mmammmmmmm i need campari tomatoes. basil. and pasta. and olive oil and salt.and peper.
959 2018-08-17 21:34:16 @KiRbY_GoT_MoJo yooooo this coconut oil shit is fantastic! Lol just thought I’d mention that

961 2018-08-17 21:33:30 Coconut oil is like the cure for everything. Dry skin? BOOM! Coconut oil. Gum in your hair? BOOM! Coconut oil. Cancer? BOOM! Coconut oil.
962 2018-08-17 21:33:16 I caught her peeping. Wait for it. She was hiding behind olive oil down bottom of Aile. But than snuck up top Aile closer to me hearing my conversation about eating disorder. Nosey and blatant
963 2018-08-17 21:33:14 Speaking of oil change , I need one
964 2018-08-17 21:33:13 Have you tried lavender oil on the souls of you feet ?
965 2018-08-17 21:32:56 walked up to a salad bar with confidence and came home with an arugula/iceberg lettuce salad with hard boiled eggs, black olives, blue cheese, and sesame oil dressing #ilovemyselfihatemyself
966 2018-08-17 21:32:53 My skin feels so soft, I will never not use coconut oil
967 2018-08-17 21:32:50 I have to admit that I never watched him for more than 30 seconds until last week with @AliVelshi . That showed me a narcissist who will use ANY trick to push his brand of snake oil. He blatantly bullied Ali by insisting he agree on some dumb point & NEVER just answered straight
968 2018-08-17 21:32:41 CALLING ALL FARRIERS!

We are looking for between 5 and 10 farriers that are willing to trial our hoof oil.
969 2018-08-17 21:32:32 Ugh, truffle oil is the worst.
970 2018-08-17 21:32:20 Believe it was titled "Daylighters" bioengineered bugs eat oil and tires. Quick grab from local library about 8 years ago.
971 2018-08-17 21:32:18 Tbh if I had the money I would've revamped my wardrobe to look like that of the 4th wife of an West African oil tycoon polygamist. 

Me Adv hajia Halima Al-fadu, ivy league educated,has most presence, not the prettiest wife but the most influential over our husband.
972 2018-08-17 21:32:17 Unattributed and out of context snippets. Can you give us the dates for these? Oil? What a joke. It is worth almost nothing now.
973 2018-08-17 21:32:15 The oil sands are profitable to extract and refine or ship reasonable distances but no one was signing on to ship bitumen 5000 kms. It wasn't economical

Sorry
974 2018-08-17 21:32:07 Also this study I quoted had “vegans” and NOT those on a WFPB no oil diet.
975 2018-08-17 21:31:55 I don’t understand why we have to pay for cars,put gas in them and still have constantly get oil changes and etc 
976 2018-08-17 21:31:54 Second cup of coffee and fish oil seem to be finally launching their breakout offensive into today's depression.
977 2018-08-17 21:31:53 @DrMichaelLBrown Yr piece re CA 2943 misses a point that needs a mention.  By all means, everyone ought 2go about their business &follow their understanding of their faith.

But those supporting th bill aren't evil/anti-Christian - they honestly believe it 2b selling snake oil.
978 2018-08-17 21:31:51 Does putting olive oil on your hair help? For natural hair?

981 2018-08-17 21:31:35 Norway’s oil industry represents 22% of GDP.  In US terms that would produce 146 million barrels per day, or 1.5x the entire globe’s consumption.  Sorry you hate Mother Earth that much.
982 2018-08-17 21:31:15 Makes sense. They want to buy low and sell high. I hope they don’t find out about the Oil well and oil that is VET & VTHO
983 2018-08-17 21:31:11 Omg I need a oil change next week.
984 2018-08-17 21:31:05 But... Tired. And my hair is looking real weird as I've stuck coconut oil in it!
985 2018-08-17 21:30:59 الهالات اذا كانت وراثة صعب انها تروح بشكل كامل ولكن تقدري تخففي من حدة اللون اشربي مويا كويس ونامي كويس واعتني بالمنطقة دايم حطي e oil و سوي خيار وبطاطس مبشورين وثلجيها ومرريها تحت عينك وفيه خلطات كثير جربي اللي تناسبك ورطبي دايم واخر شى ممكن تحسني منها تجميلياً وبس ياعمري 
986 2018-08-17 21:30:52 China was the biggest winner in Iraq they along with a host of international oil corporations(including Halliburton) gained control of some of the most incredible conventional oil fields on earth- what the war was really about
987 2018-08-17 21:30:28 Why is no one ever around when I need help opening this darn coconut oil jar?!!? Impossible.
988 2018-08-17 21:30:17 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
989 2018-08-17 21:30:13 Fuck boys. I’ll change my oil all by myself 
990 2018-08-17 21:30:12 How to stay sane in ph.
1. Enjoy Bole and fish. The best you will find in Elekahia housing estate, Dline and Trans Amadi.
2. Avoid Aba road on Wednesdays. Oil Mill Market won’t let you see road.
3. There are only 2 Cinemas. Genesis and Filmhouse(don’t go that far at night)
991 2018-08-17 21:30:08 Elon gone as CEO and Saudi oil money backing - sounds bullish to me 
992 2018-08-17 21:30:03 Real science does not support it. It like snake oil for the mind. And personally history
993 2018-08-17 21:29:45 So you think the $100 million Oil Services deal won’t happen or NNPC even though Trifafara bank $50mm did ? Dude you sold out at wrong time
994 2018-08-17 21:29:16 Peppermint oil liberally doused over all nooks and crannies and pierced conkers (must be pierced) in all corners and you’ll be alllll good!
995 2018-08-17 21:28:56 Waiting to get my oil change and this guy is trying to sell me on Uber Eats and this is his pitch “I will gladly drive anyone’s food around town. I have a Prius so I’m kinda perfect for it”
996 2018-08-17 21:28:55 Argan oil
997 2018-08-17 21:28:54 Went to get a oil change today fucked around and dropped $175 smh lol

999 2018-08-17 21:28:24 Hell yeah bro u need help w some car problems. I gottchu. I did one of your friend bmw oil filter housing and im fixing a fox bodu rn for a friend
1000 2018-08-17 21:28:22 Why is my body so freaking delicate!? Sh#t!! We just did a little physio and my foot went the wrong way!!!

Taking some extra strength High #CBD @tilray 1:25 & @PeaceNaturals Blueberry Sky THC oil at 29.4%!  And it's not medication eh?
#AnnsWisdom #Donttaxmedicine
1001 2018-08-17 21:28:16 Um land and goods are profit by definition not just oil or money. That’s where the phrase “spoils of war” comes from, and if you don’t think we profited from ww2 you don’t know much about it.
1002 2018-08-17 21:28:11 U long for a war criminal? Who took us to an illegal war? Who murdered millions of innocent humans..all for the sake of some oil..and do you long for an MP like Ian Austin as well? An MP who voted against the Iraq enquiry 8 times..
1003 2018-08-17 21:27:50 #DonnieWhopper selling snake oil
1004 2018-08-17 21:27:50 I am an independent. When the snake oil salesman was voted into the presidency I thought about becoming either a Democrat or Republican to try to fix things from the inside. I realized Republicans were beyond repair. Still independent tho since 2 tries to be dem failed. Paperwork
1005 2018-08-17 21:27:34 He didn’t say stop using oil, he said stop our overuse. Natural gas is a great alternative.  Plentiful and much cleaner.  Still a fossil fuel though.
1006 2018-08-17 21:27:34 Radical Islam wasn’t even a fucking thing in Iran  until we toppled Mohammed Mosaddegh and installed our own puppet dictator to insure that we profited from their oil supplies. Not every war is fought for profit, but every war we’ve been involved in since WW2 has been
1007 2018-08-17 21:27:33 Hate when they ask for something just because they see it, like no lil nigga this motor oil!!
1008 2018-08-17 21:27:31 I'd wash them stick them in the slow cooker on high in the morning will be ready for tea time. If you want a crispy skin rub with olive oil and stick them in the oven 30 minutes before you need them xx
1009 2018-08-17 21:27:19 They told us growing up that energy was limited....but they made us think that oil is the only source of energy. 

We come to find out that oil is not going to run out anytime soon and like TESLA said energy is infinite he just have to learn how to harness it
1010 2018-08-17 21:27:12 Did you use beef dripping as your fat of choice? Probably used organic truffle infused quinoa oil.
1011 2018-08-17 21:26:54 Finally got some tea tree oil for these stupid Keloids
1012 2018-08-17 21:26:52 Nice needs pesto or chilli oil.
1013 2018-08-17 21:26:52 Will you keep quiet? How many oil blocs have you given to yourself ? How much revenues have you pocketed? How much subsidy scams have you involved yourselves in for the past 16yrs. If you didn't made nigeria all these years what do you want to do now?
1014 2018-08-17 21:26:51 Day one I’m going to store and buying hi cbd oil, honesty. I have anxiety as it is.  But  to be fair, the first short bull run... account moves of 10k fucked me up, now those don’t matter much is the 50k drops.  Building up up tolerance lol
1015 2018-08-17 21:26:38 Venezuela and Nigeria mad oil revenues and they still shit *sigh
1016 2018-08-17 21:26:26 @AC360 two Watts girls found in oil and gas tanks almost full
1017 2018-08-17 21:26:25 Pipelines  are proven to be safer than shipping and rail as a transport for oil.  Oil will not stop being used even if you stop pipelines.  Stop this pointless campaign for continued endangerment of our environment.
1018 2018-08-17 21:26:22 olive oil is well good for u anyway!!
1019 2018-08-17 21:26:17 Snake oil salesman
1020 2018-08-17 21:26:11 Spray your dish with oil and it will not stick.
1021 2018-08-17 21:26:06 As opposed to allow crude oil to be transported via rail and by tanker truckload?  These modes of transport are far riskier, less safe and endanger our environment to a far greater  potential extent than America’s pipleline system.
1022 2018-08-17 21:26:05 G'day Cory,
politics, media, integrity
Oil doesn't mix with water
Like "integrity" with politics, and media.
Challenge, can you change this?
1023 2018-08-17 21:25:51 And there's always bac fa yu, white flower oil, which will stop any itch but will announce your presence in a room
1024 2018-08-17 21:25:43 Note to self: Must buy some industrial seed oil today.
1025 2018-08-17 21:25:36 Norway has a small population with a huge oil reserve that bankrolls their policies. Very different than Venezuela, which your policies will emulate with larger populations and an already $21 trillion debt.
1026 2018-08-17 21:25:34 What do you call the nationalization of their oil?  Free market?
1027 2018-08-17 21:25:31 Too much oil
1028 2018-08-17 21:25:08 Stainless steel #nameplates are extremely durable, and they can withstand the harsh environments common in the #oil and gas industry.
1029 2018-08-17 21:24:53 How do you get people to pay for protections from snake oil salesmen (aka drug companies) if not by taxes that are compelled? Caveat emptor just opens up the killing fields for them. You may be ok with elderly people and children dying because of lack of tax money but I am not.
1030 2018-08-17 21:24:32 Oil and Gas isn't doing great at all in the rest of the world outside Alberta. Look at oil field sevice companies like Schlumberger, Baker Hughs and Technip, they all announced lay offs and cut costs as recently as February.
1031 2018-08-17 21:24:15 It’s the safest way to transport oil in the world.  Without new and safe pipelines being built, we run the risk of older pipelines leaking from overuse and lack of maintenance.  Alternatively, transporting via rail is more expensive and more dangerous.  #oil #energy #MAGA
1032 2018-08-17 21:24:11 Have news for you,Scotland will be independent very soon so make sure you not counting with the oil and gas money that come from North of the border.
ENJOY YOUR LITTLE ENGLAND.
1033 2018-08-17 21:23:59 Alright, someone at Amazon messed up my order and sent me fish oil pills...
1034 2018-08-17 21:23:52 Hah!  I know a 34 yr old person who refuses to use Murphy's Oil Soap because one of their millennial friends read that it's a horrible product to use on wood.

(Sorry, just one of hundreds of memorable *millennial moments* I've experienced in recent years.)

Good suggestion, btw.
1035 2018-08-17 21:23:25 Canada’s borders made impassable! Oil spills on coasts, massive sewage emissions in both Atlantic and Pacific, pipeline development faked but for $4.5 billion dollars, inland borders destroyed, immigration systems destroyed and out of control! All forcing Canada toward war
1036 2018-08-17 21:23:10 Truffles, truffle oil, truffle anything is fucking gross. It doesn’t make you some sort of food god if you like them. Truffles. Are. Caca.
1037 2018-08-17 21:22:52 Canola oil stans getting brave? and for what?
1038 2018-08-17 21:22:31 Seriously.  I smell oil cans and sawdust when I look at Julez in that shirt.  

Can he just go work at the garage?  I’d like him better there than as a barista.
1039 2018-08-17 21:22:01 To what?  

Name a single energy source that is as efficient, plentiful and convenient as oil.  

Tell us what you're willing to give up when we get rid of oil.
1040 2018-08-17 21:21:48 My new book: OIL and GOD
Obama was hostile toward SaudiA in April 2016 Atlantic Mag. 
He cited state-sponsored misogyny, manipulating the Wash. playbook & radicalizing Indonesia’s Islam. His NSC staff remind visitors that the large majority of 9/11 hijackers were not Iranian.
1041 2018-08-17 21:21:45 didn’t choose to compete with Russia over a small amount of oil, maybe the people of Syria would have a substantially better life, maybe if we weren’t blowing that entire section of the planet up every fucking day, the Middle East might be a little more stable
1042 2018-08-17 21:21:43 Caje:  flour, eggs (egg substitute), butter/oil (canola oil works great) milk (I’m sure there’s a vegan milk that bakes well), sugar.  Icing can be made with sugar and water.
1043 2018-08-17 21:21:25 Cheese for Taika, a cup of oil for Loki, a 40 of Steel Reserve for Valkyrie, some Wonka candy for Jeff Goldblum
1044 2018-08-17 21:21:21 Your sentiment is not winning me over.
1045 2018-08-17 21:21:07 While I don’t agree with locs sentiment, yours is off base as well. Albertans have nothing to apologize for. Oil from a far worse alternative would immediately fill the void.
1046 2018-08-17 21:20:52 looks like an oil painting!

1047 2018-08-17 21:20:49 @Russell___Smith @ChanceWKGN Name the new ballpark after @BearWKGN and call it, "No Oil Change Park"
1048 2018-08-17 21:20:17 If it’s ALL for financial profit, then by definition it can never be for land or anything else. You’re half right but it’s because we wanted oil domination over Russia, there are competing pipelines, maybe the issue has nothing to do with human rights in Syria, considering if we
1049 2018-08-17 21:19:37 Oh really? I thought they’re drenched in Olive Oil anyway?
1050 2018-08-17 21:19:36 I can't believe I spent 2+ years of my life cooking food in 1 calorie spray because I was too scared to use oil. I just made pasta with a 'sauce' and by sauce I mean olive oil and garlic and I am truly so happy
1051 2018-08-17 21:19:31 refined sugar, HFCS, hydrogenated palm oil, and artificial flavor are the gastronomic embodiment of capitalism but they’re also candy
1052 2018-08-17 21:19:03 Great I remember you saying something about coconut oil before so I did that and it helped a ton but if the deep conditioner helps too then I def want to try it
1053 2018-08-17 21:19:02 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
1054 2018-08-17 21:18:41 Using extra virgin olive oil instead of shaving cream helps a lot too. Also bikini zone!!
1055 2018-08-17 21:18:28 @ anyone whos into aromatherapy: whats the most popular essential oil just in terms of fragrance?
1056 2018-08-17 21:18:25 ちょっと二度寝してきます
1057 2018-08-17 21:18:17 Ants will go after a packet of dried seaweed (and die in the seasoning oil)  if left out on a table.
1058 2018-08-17 21:18:10 Very true. I believe the situation has changed a bit in 2018 due to growth in the #Permian but outside of oil & gas #nmecon remains pretty weak. Still fewer workers employed than in 2008. Means less tax dollars.  @NMOilAndGas
1059 2018-08-17 21:18:10 Exactly. I would say that Mr. Wall is busy dog-whistling to people who think the oil industry is and should be red-meat.
1060 2018-08-17 21:18:05 They won't be happy until it's gone and they can drill for more oil.
1061 2018-08-17 21:17:53 It’s not a cream but rosehip oil is amazing!! I use it as a moisturizer and it also cleared my skin up
1062 2018-08-17 21:17:53 For a given Crude Oil of a specific API Gravity & fluid properties, the bubble-point pressure is always constant regardless of what time of the production process the reservoir is in.

Reservoir pressure inevitably decreases during production.

1066 2018-08-17 21:17:12 And you got a coupon for your next oil change! 
1067 2018-08-17 21:17:09 Yes. They put it out like it’s gonna be a hit. Gone put some oil and pepper on it. Wtf
1068 2018-08-17 21:17:08 like, the face, the poise, the sheer elegance, i want to learn oil painting just so i can paint her
1069 2018-08-17 21:16:06 LRT That game scared me so much, I couldn't go deepeer into the levels, the creatures scared me, and the LEVEL WITH THE WHALES HAD ME TERRIFIED as a kid, and idek how you end up w aliens and swimming intubes of oil tbh
1070 2018-08-17 21:15:58 Nah. I hate the whole thing, lol. It's just a bunch of old people trying to stay relevant in a time ruled by Millennials. "I member the good ol' days when we didn't have fancy Ipads nor no smart phones. We got are hands dirty and drank Diesel Oil for Breakfast."
1071 2018-08-17 21:15:55 Does anybody knowwww where I could get CBD oil?
1072 2018-08-17 21:15:38 We're so conditioned to think of money as scarce that most of us would feel like we have no purpose. Sadly.

However, the simple answer is; oil on canvas painting and spending time in nature.
1073 2018-08-17 21:15:28 if I break ur heart,  no oil spillage
1074 2018-08-17 21:15:24 I've had success by using a non-stick aluminum foil on the bottom of the pan and also coating the fish in some olive oil so that it can slide off the pan.

1078 2018-08-17 21:15:02 Maybe if you stop bombing the innocent women and children in other countries and looting oil not minding your own business, it wouldn't have created so many refugees to start with but hey sit on your high horse believing in all the biased BS 

Peace 
1079 2018-08-17 21:15:02 Sorry my beard been on fliggity lately whose got the dope beard oil to recommend ? It’s finally to that point.
1080 2018-08-17 21:15:01 The Dawn commercials cleaning the animals affected by the oil spills always gets me 
1081 2018-08-17 21:14:52 I checked earlier and my copy of "Like a Prayer" stills smells of patchouli oil ... IN YOUR FACE PINK FLOYD!!! #MADONNA
1082 2018-08-17 21:14:45 Also The Caucasus and the Oil by Wilhelm Tieke. A bit more hard work but fascinating.
1083 2018-08-17 21:14:40 And one day I will walk with my children across desloate industrial yards manned mostly by machines and say...once this was a redwood forest...once this was an impressive rock structure that predated modern man...when will man learn that you can't eat money, you can't breathe oil
1084 2018-08-17 21:14:07 Really, you don't know what you're missing. Oven roasted with a little olive oil until the onions are caramelized....YUM!
1085 2018-08-17 21:13:58 Who wants to come w me to get an oil change bc I don't know what I'm doing?
1086 2018-08-17 21:13:56 Ok so as a cat lady lemme give you some tips to try and get your baby back home:

You should leave out a can of sardines outside, the boneless kind in oil would be perfect, and strong smelling canned cat food near the door as the smell is sure to attract him back!
1087 2018-08-17 21:13:33 A big hard bloke in midfield ... support for Oil up top and an experienced defensive head to help bring on the young lads would be the dream ... we will probably end up with a promising 21 year old winger
1088 2018-08-17 21:13:32 For me it's olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper 
1089 2018-08-17 21:13:31 It's not hard to stop eating meat or dairy the problem I have is finding food without soy or canola oil in it
1090 2018-08-17 21:13:29 Movie  and oil changes at the car dealership
1091 2018-08-17 21:13:28 i keep forgetting to check my oil 
1092 2018-08-17 21:13:20 1/ You haven’t refuted my point.  I didn’t say the other NATO members didn’t contribute anything.  U.S. 5th fleet in Bahrain keeps the Persian Gulf open, from which Europe gets much of its oil. U.S. keeps the Pacific trade-routes open.  Defense isn’t all the U.S. does for Europe:
1093 2018-08-17 21:13:15 Susana Martinez won reelection too and she is rated the most incompetent gov in the US. You'd be surprised how many votes oil money can buy.
1094 2018-08-17 21:13:06 Some fuckhead on Xbox just said “I’m going to oil up your taint and fry some tilapia on it. Distracted me so damn much I got sniped. Tactics 101 
1095 2018-08-17 21:13:04 Slow roast in the oven with olive oil, garlic and herbs.  Cook and blitz.  Freeze.  Instant pasta sauce.
1096 2018-08-17 21:13:03 Hey you know how girls use castor oil to make their eyelashes longer, would the same work for guys and their beards??
1097 2018-08-17 21:12:58 Oil language
1098 2018-08-17 21:12:55 FR!! That vat of oil always said hi to me when i passed, seemed like a nice vat. Never saw it coming
1099 2018-08-17 21:12:48 Oh you prefer a snake oil salesman approach ?
1100 2018-08-17 21:12:47 I’m going to be so honest with you guys did anyone know how to do oil changes? 

 I don’t feel like paying a tire, a door, and a break piece for an oil. 
1101 2018-08-17 21:12:41 Just paid $25 for a full synthetic oil change .... sheeeeit
1102 2018-08-17 21:12:35 It’s Because SA is oil rich.
1103 2018-08-17 21:12:32 100 percent this. Always irrationally furious I can't touch the surface of the oil paintings at art galleries
1104 2018-08-17 21:12:31 I described my week in an email earlier today as a dumpster fire rolling downhill towards an oil refinery.
1105 2018-08-17 21:12:24 Why do Pak &Turkish not conduct bilateral sports events with each other. Football series, boxing, Pak wrestling vs Oil wrestling. Pak have good pop industry why do not both countries arrange consort each year combinely.Pak drama dubbed in Turkish on air In Turkish TV channels.
1106 2018-08-17 21:12:22 Tax breaks for kalamatas, oil cured, and castlevetranos!!
1107 2018-08-17 21:12:20 I literally have oil sitting in the tanks. 2 companies don't have drivers and just added a 3rd hauler. Drivers are making 150k a yr in Permian. My wells are in East Texas.
1108 2018-08-17 21:11:58 Yeah, just dip the french
baguette in olive oil.
Delicious!
1109 2018-08-17 21:11:46 ISIS first took over the oil field in July, 2014. They were pushed out by the @CJTFOIR #SDF coalition earlier this year. I suspect ISIS is attacking from their outpost near #Hajin because the coalition claimed they were cleared out of the east. This will be over quickly.
1110 2018-08-17 21:11:44 You ain’t said nothin slick to a can of oil kid. Dealing with that shit as we speak. I’d rather get shot
1111 2018-08-17 21:11:30 The alternative is that lead and asbestos and oil extraction corporations get together with global authoritarians like Putin and 45 to commit crimes against humanity blatantly with impunity. We face existential risk as a species and to life in the universe.
1112 2018-08-17 21:11:13 It clears hurdle to giving oil companies whatever they want, ignoring FN rights, and reducing any chance we have at reducing our CO2 emissions to the targets we should.
1113 2018-08-17 21:11:07 #FreebieFriday is baaack! Follow & RT for the chance to WIN a Pomegranate & Argan Oil Hand Wash! T&Cs apply. #prize #win
1114 2018-08-17 21:11:05 Those same fossil fuels contributed to global warming, causing the fires. As Albertans, we should apologize for the privilege that oil has bestowed upon us.
1115 2018-08-17 21:10:52 I'm too to being able to resist junk food by thinking of how I needed to save all my money. But now that I'm like... middle class oil dont have that helpful if stressful trick to eat well.
1116 2018-08-17 21:10:47 How can that be? Are you suggesting that all the "fracking is safe" advertising by the oil industry is a lie?

Imagine that.

1124 2018-08-17 21:09:30 Coming from a fan of a team that only dominate the league because of oil money... Yeaaah, enjoy your "wholesome" and "deserved success".
1125 2018-08-17 21:09:28 No. But I want my pastor to eat ass.
1126 2018-08-17 21:09:20 Smoking it of course will damage your lungs more so please do try the oil. It's  easy to use I  just add a few drops to my food daily with each meal and have found relief
1127 2018-08-17 21:09:19 Oh boy...the usual suspects.
Omega 3's from plant oil, nuts and seeds.
B12 from fortified foods, meat is fortified with B12 also.
Plants have non-heme Iron where as meat has heme iron.
Have you checked what nutrients your deficient in?

He is trying to cause citizens to doubt NY leadership because He Putin & his Russian friends have designs on NY. one of them being oil drilling off Statin Island. This was Manifourts approach
1133 2018-08-17 21:08:38 You should stop selling oil to the US, break diplomatic relations with that nation and declare a state of war. Those gringos must learn to respect the voice of the people.

1135 2018-08-17 21:08:25 I understand your point, that Y and A continued to pour oil into Mahat's fire. I agree with you on that. Actually Y&A were more "concerned" that Sendu was chosen as worst performer, and Mahat was more angry in his perception that momo didn't appreciate him.

1139 2018-08-17 21:08:00 Gotcha, Mark and I were discussing a boiled linseed oil. It would provide a nice darker finish that should stand up to the heavy usage of a knife. Then you wouldn't need the shellac either.

1144 2018-08-17 21:06:57 I think I finally made a decision on what I like more and it’s oil over flower all day
1145 2018-08-17 21:06:51 I just bought a cool new Samsung Galaxy SG  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
1146 2018-08-17 21:06:50 Now that I think about this choice I have to stain that sandwich out of the oil.....
1147 2018-08-17 21:06:36 As a non AMERICAN, I would say you guys/girls have a tendency to worship biz figures. You’ve done it with motor, banks, pharma, retail, bio and tech. I guess you have a soft spot for snake oil
1148 2018-08-17 21:06:29 Had a patient this week who wasn’t taking his doxazosin because he didn’t want to take tablets all the time because it wasn’t natural and he felt fine.
Was buying and taking cod liver oil and turmeric though. The mind boggles.

1154 2018-08-17 21:05:33 I have a theory that restaurants serve steak fries because they want to minimize the surface area of potato that comes into contact with the oil, maximizing the total number of potatoes worth of fries that they can deep-fry before changing the oil. I will not yield on this.

1156 2018-08-17 21:05:20 P is the reservoir pressure at any given time.

Pb is the bubble-point pressure for the crude oil present within the reservoir - the pressure at which the first bubble of dissolved gas evolves from the crude oil.

1158 2018-08-17 21:05:14 I have had to add a new hauler for oil because I can't get loads picked up. Two companies have no drivers because the drivers went to the Permian. They can make 150k a year there.

1168 2018-08-17 21:03:56 I'm curious to know the utility of, or the insights that are to be derived from, asserting there has never been an energy transition. The step-up in energy density from wood to coal unleased a massive economic and infrastructural transformation, as did coal -> oil.

1172 2018-08-17 21:03:31 We are screwed, bc of people who have denied that pollution has any ill effect on the planet.  We've known the problem for decades, but big oil has suppressed the evidence.
1173 2018-08-17 21:03:12 I might switch to that one. I have the doo grip stimulating oil(the orange) and my mom has the anti itch one. Hopefully the mega thick one comes through.
1174 2018-08-17 21:03:10 Plains All American claims its 2015 oil spill into the Pacific Ocean in Santa Barbara was an accident, not a criminal act. Prosecutors say “willful ignorance” and policy violations led to thousands of gallons of crude dumped, causing dozens of animals to be killed.

1200 2018-08-17 20:58:25 I really should stop using the jokes my dad says... the homie changing my oil said “sorry for the wait there’s a plate under your car so it takes a little longer” and I said “oh no worries, I forgot those Germans like to complicate things”

Lmao WHAT kylie why ?

1212 2018-08-17 20:56:30 Then... coat your hands with oil - put plastic bags on them & let the oil draw the dye out. I think it may help & the oil will help moisturize.
1213 2018-08-17 20:56:27 The juggernaut oil tanker is juddering to a slow down & stop and hopefully a reverse. 

It can't happen unless the momentum is slowed by a change from the Captain's chair. 

It's never an instant change but change is happening & under a new Captain new routes can be plotted.

So now I’m getting an oil change 
1219 2018-08-17 20:55:30 Put Wales into that equation and it’s obvious that England depends enormously on the Celtic efforts. Then there’s water, oil, specialist products like whisky, Welsh lamb, etc etc.Big question -why ARE the Celts propping up this bankrupt and corrupt union?

1251 2018-08-17 20:50:27 I hate the fact that I work with team leads who like to argue and must always have the last word!  Mostly b/c I'm the same way and at times tryna communicate  is like oil on water.... It ain't gonna mix!

1253 2018-08-17 20:50:07 Thanks, mate, it was lots of lovely oil paint mostly on canvas, really enjoyed it. Was going to message you- when are those Doctor Who drawings needed by? I’m really sorry, I know you said a few times but my brain’s not made for organisation.
1254 2018-08-17 20:50:00 So I meant for a 30 minutes nap, then to continue sewing. Instead I got a 150 minute nap. No sewing. And the coupons for oil changes that my parents were so excited about are all expired, so I guess I'm paying full price.

Oh well.
1255 2018-08-17 20:49:50 What are your plans once you get the go ahead to plant it? Is it to supply to those here making oil for health products, or a animal feed or supplement? I see hemp fed cattle is taking off overseas. Just first I've heard of any being planted down here.

1288 2018-08-17 20:45:57 It’s straight THC oil.  It comes in a syringe like thick tar.  Flower does not work for me, as with my seizures I need it working round the clock, and flower wears off quick.  Oil under the tongue or in pill form lasts 6-8 hours
1289 2018-08-17 20:45:44 I thought it was just that Unionists like a good bonfire. Isn't Arlene pro-Brexit though or is she trying to pour oil on the water faster than her shower are pouring petrol?

1291 2018-08-17 20:45:41 I always stick my feet out of the covers I find that helps slightly, i also take pregablin which just helps the restlessness and different sensations and most recently cbd oil before bed (I've been suffering for 5years with this so been desperate to sleep normally) good luck x x

1296 2018-08-17 20:44:32 I used to put CBD oil in my coffee every morning until I got burned out on the taste. It enabled me to not take any meds for my multiple chronic illnesses until dinner time and completely cut out some of the meds, with my doctor’s blessing. Hoping to find alternate food to mix w/

1298 2018-08-17 20:43:54 While the suggestion of "lighter fluid" would certainly work, @gingerandpippin has a method that simply uses some kitchen roll with some oil on it. Works well, & doesn't leave your kitchen smelling like you have a solvent abuse problem.

1310 2018-08-17 20:43:02 Unless you have a skin condition, it really ain't hard to have nice skin. Drink lots of water, find a soap that agrees with your skin, find an oil/cream/lotion that agrees with your skin. That's it in a nutshell.
1311 2018-08-17 20:42:43 We have just about the most carbon intensive oil on the planet and the extraction process involving tailings ponds is among the most environmentally ruthless.

1366 2018-08-17 20:34:36 Yeah, its not like the US CIA staged a coup in 1953, installing a pro western leader willing to privatize the oil to western interests. The puppet gov. was eventually over thrown during the Iranian revolution in 1979.

1387 2018-08-17 20:32:27 How? You'd stand up to Saudi and their oil and arms deals? You're having a Turkish mate. Deluded drivel.
1388 2018-08-17 20:32:20 i imagine gold and oil have been correlated
1389 2018-08-17 20:32:14 I also learned that I don't actually need an appointment to get my oil changed at the dealership AND they're open on Saturdays, all of which would've been nice to know years ago.

1392 2018-08-17 20:31:43 Oily skin problems: my eyes burn because the oil keeps getting in my eyes  I just washed my face, I shouldn’t be this oily already.
1393 2018-08-17 20:31:28 Just made popcorn with coconut oil and seasoned it with Tajin
1394 2018-08-17 20:31:16 Gabapentin didn’t help me either. My friend says low dose naltrexone is what her doctors are trying. And I have some friends who use cbd oil. Lyrica also didn’t work for me, but that may be one to try if you haven’t. I hate the weight gain. So sorry, love.
1395 2018-08-17 20:30:54 Okayyy! Like change my oil so i can go!

1397 2018-08-17 20:30:46 By the end of next week I am determined to have mamba’s brakes and rotors done, an oil change, as well as spark plugs changed. Gotta start setting time limits on my goals and not push them aside for next week
1398 2018-08-17 20:30:39 Let me tell my daddy i need a oil change
1399 2018-08-17 20:30:19 Putting poppers in my essential oil diffuser
1400 2018-08-17 20:30:14 Over 700 chemicals are commonly used in the process of drilling and #fracking for oil and gas. At least 25% of these chemicals increase our risk of #cancer and 30% are hormone disruptors. @JerryBrownGov #StopFuelingCancer #BrownsLastChance #BreastCancer
1401 2018-08-17 20:29:58 I need to get me some more lipstick and oil

1404 2018-08-17 20:29:39 Mackinder's Heartland theory in play...
All surplus economies are located on EuroAsia EU, RF, China. Enough energy and Sheik's oil, Russia's resources. 
All conflict located there have fingerprints of Island powers who increasingly are lagging or go forward only increasing debt.
1405 2018-08-17 20:29:32 That may be true for now, but there is no perfect country. Just like the US they have issues. increasing poverty, One of the highest per household debt in all of europe. Their great social programs rely heavily on their ever shrinking oil profits they kill whales bro..lol

1409 2018-08-17 20:28:52 @USAmbUganda and @UKinUganda pretending not to see the evil @KagutaMuseveni is visiting on UG leftists because her oil washes off human rights violations. I have not seen, heard or read any statement from this evil axis of leeches condemning brazen violation of Human rights in UG
1410 2018-08-17 20:28:48 I was bout to say! 

oil changes only like 3x a year lol
1411 2018-08-17 20:28:46 Canola is a liquid oil.  It is made from canola plants - I have seen them growing in Canada and even here in NC.  I am in the South and Crisco has definitely dropped in popularity.
1412 2018-08-17 20:28:41 candlelight only oil lamps are a okay substituiton
1413 2018-08-17 20:28:34 Normally, I agree with you on political issues, but why are whales sacared? Many countries have hunted them and eaten them for centuries, let alone utilizing whale blubber for oil, heat and lighting purposes.

Do you feel the same way about that steak you enjoyed last night?
1414 2018-08-17 20:28:22 Having no oil on your dipstick is a good thing right?
1415 2018-08-17 20:28:15 Unconventional oil drilling, which isn't too different to fracking, is happening in Surrey right now, but the reaction from central government has been the same as for elsewhere.
1416 2018-08-17 20:28:12 คุณครับผมอยากมีเพื่อนคุยสักคนช่วยรับผมเป็นเพื่อนสักคนนะครับ
1417 2018-08-17 20:28:08 Power oil
1418 2018-08-17 20:27:56 Ben, I would argue that the oil based economy wasn't the biggest problem. The problem was the government taking over the means of production. The people the government put in charge of the oil rigs didn't know how to run them. They became woefully inefficient. Bureaucracy fails.
1419 2018-08-17 20:27:35 *starts heating the oil*
1420 2018-08-17 20:27:20 Yeah, we were less pine sol more Murphy’s oil soap and lemon

1423 2018-08-17 20:26:24 I used a toaster for the sound of a fox trap and the sound of bacon frying in the skillet + fire for a qulliq (inuit oil lamp) in Beneath Floes 
1424 2018-08-17 20:26:21 It’s because of oil rig workers who come onshore on Friday’s and travel south from Aberdeen
1425 2018-08-17 20:26:12 1) covered in motor oil ?!? 
2) "baby house panther"?!?  So I guess we have a "house wolf"?
1426 2018-08-17 20:26:06 Speaking of Pine Sol I just mopped our floors with Murphy's Oil. Another childhood staple

1427 2018-08-17 20:26:01 I used to respect Elon Musk, but then he became a giant asshole that accepts Saudi oil money to fund his ELECTRIC CAR COMPANY. Hypocrite.
1428 2018-08-17 20:25:51 
1429 2018-08-17 20:25:35 Delicious. How does it taste?
I like getting a little of the lime oil from the skin out with the muddle... Tends to add a hint of a bitter profile that enhances the spicy/sweet/sour
1430 2018-08-17 20:25:28 They are just looking for oil.
1431 2018-08-17 20:25:09 Dear @Cristiano 
I just want to let you know that in Nigeria you are called ORORO, it is the local name for vegetable oil, because you slip from defenders, your shot is like hot oil and you are never dull. 

You are respected here. Ororo
1432 2018-08-17 20:25:09 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!

1435 2018-08-17 20:24:29 I would not be able to talk if my kids were missing.   Hope he has a long life in prison. He put those babies is oil drums and He deserves to be haunted by what he did every day he’s alive.

1437 2018-08-17 20:24:21 Am also dealing with annual courgette bonanza from garden. Can recommend (long v low slow cook, surprisingly) thinly sliced courgettes, with ditto fennel and mint cooked in coconut oil. With bits of goats cheese served on pasta. Bloody delicious.
1438 2018-08-17 20:24:19 Ain't that the Truth. 

And the bums are protesting an oil pipe line.  
Halarious.....
1439 2018-08-17 20:24:15 Trump is looking to cut Iranian oil exports such that the US Oil industry, the Saudis, and Putin all make much more money. 

What a coincidence that they are all Trump's pals! 
1440 2018-08-17 20:24:11 I just wanna get my oil change and go 
1441 2018-08-17 20:24:09 Poor oil, too heavy, too much sulfur.
1442 2018-08-17 20:23:44 Big oil wasn't trustworthy, buying scientists and putting misinformation all over the internet. But all is forgiven as soon as some marketing manager puts out a image booster.

Someone agreeing with co2 causing cagw can't be a scientist because scientific method.
1443 2018-08-17 20:23:43 Waiting for my car to get an oil change, it’s too hot out for this
1444 2018-08-17 20:23:42 Women have to get their oil changed once a month.
1445 2018-08-17 20:23:29 Wow. Applications for this are endless. I'm thinking oil & gas industry in the North Sea & The Forth Rail bridge repairs.
1446 2018-08-17 20:23:25 i want dumplings n. Chili oil :-(
1447 2018-08-17 20:23:04 Concerns about the Turkish economy where quickly forgotten on Wednesday when we learned US and China trade negotiators will be meeting within weeks.

1448 2018-08-17 20:22:41 Wtfff?? That's so messed up I hate oil companies so much
1449 2018-08-17 20:22:35 they have 300 billion barrel oil reserve and their economy is f up looks like they choose worst leader possible
1450 2018-08-17 20:21:54 And it took such a tiny number relative to U.S to change their whole attitude.
1451 2018-08-17 20:21:53 First one is White Bear (dry dumplings w/pickled vegetable and chilli oil), second is Tianjin lamb & squash fried in a cornstarch/vinegar slurry, third is Tianjin seabass & ginger. All in Flushing, NY. Tianjin is the author of Galaxy of Dim Sum cookbook, highly recommended.
1452 2018-08-17 20:21:51 This is such a simplified way of thinking that it's at schoolboy/girl level. If only that....then this.The money was invested in the future of this country for EVERYONE. Oil money spent on the items you mention produced more revenue for the Govt than putting it in a fund for ?
1453 2018-08-17 20:21:45 oil is soo important to clean innerds  ^^
1454 2018-08-17 20:21:39 Went to get my oil changed today and the guy told me “do you know there’s a mouse in your car?” Sir. No I didn’t put it there can you please get it OUT
1455 2018-08-17 20:21:34 Just went to a massage place for the first time...lay down after hnderessjng to my under wear... she pulled my boxers down, put oil in her hands Strattled the back of my head with her vagina and rubbed my ass cheeks.. it took everything in me to not moan like a bitch
1456 2018-08-17 20:21:19 This Gospel album is such a gem, truly. Theologically it may differ from my current beliefs, but baby LISSEN! You cannot deny the oil!
1457 2018-08-17 20:21:15 teach me your olive oil ways we have a biggg kitchen that could use some good cooking in 
1458 2018-08-17 20:21:12 The US uses mostly oil and coal (60%). The US also has to transfer energy over much longer distances. With all that into consideration it ends up being far less environmental friendly than a vehicle of equal value and comparable to the average
1459 2018-08-17 20:21:03 Proven reserves does not mean they can excavate it anytime or at any price. Saudi Arabia spends $3 to drill a barrel of oil, Russia spends over $60. Venezuela mismanaged the previous investments and kicked out the companies that were investing in its deep sea drilling.
1460 2018-08-17 20:20:54 Say what you will, but Kelly Price has oil and power in her chords
1461 2018-08-17 20:20:52 Ahhh fuck it's the oil episode for the rest of my day.
1462 2018-08-17 20:20:46 So you think throwing some truffle oil in a ground chuck makes it filet mignon?

1475 2018-08-17 20:18:19 coconut oil actually works lol
1476 2018-08-17 20:18:10 I don’t really like West African food. Everything is swimming in oil. Jollof is cute but that’s about it.
1477 2018-08-17 20:17:52 I used it for a whole week then would skip a week and then use it the following week. And I used Au Naturale products as well which I think also worked. And coconut oil
1478 2018-08-17 20:17:29 It's not to do with the wokeness of big oil, it's that they can afford to lobby Congress and municipalities to keep renewables illegal or prohibitively expensive to the majority of Americans, dramatically lengthening the lifespan of oil power. We should already be on solar.
1479 2018-08-17 20:17:26 Jews, which Jesus was, used Cannabis Oil. And still do. Gen 1:29 Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit contains seed. They will be yours for food." that's not all Mormons.....
1480 2018-08-17 20:17:11 And you little mouse, no matter what your religion, Turks do not like undignified reptiles. I hope the oil does not end and we have to help you.

1498 2018-08-17 20:15:04 I'm just glad they don't seem eager to sell snake oil to anyone since there is so much white lady market space for anything natural and somehow seemingly counter to western capitalism, even if it costs thousands of dollars

they could really be milking all of this
1499 2018-08-17 20:15:03 Cubans have already tasted your wares and unlikely to ask for second helping. Hopefully they have passed this knowledge forward
1500 2018-08-17 20:15:03 The manner and lack of professionalism that my last company exhibited when they laid me off makes me realize that I don't want to spend my life working for cowards and snake oil salesmen.

1511 2018-08-17 20:12:51 Soze ndikphoxe. I use so many things. Rose water, magnolia oil, almond oil, epimax junior and the gentle magic soap
1512 2018-08-17 20:12:29 BREAKING UPDATE:
dead (o)possum is gone.
no more blood or ooze appeared (to my knowledge).
area has been disinfected.

Area however still smells like death farts. So I'm off to Targét, for I was told peppermint oil works best on the lingering smell.
1513 2018-08-17 20:12:29 When poor uneducated tribal masses, functionally illiterate (reading signs, timetables, instructions etc), plus highly superstitious (witchcraft, snake oil pastors), they have no other ways to express anger & rage other than burning, looting, toyi-toying.

1516 2018-08-17 20:12:00 I cook my veggies, like green beans, in olive oil to raise my fat. I also mix coconut oil into my fat bombs to add more fat. You can also use nuts like walnuts and almonds for snack, because they’re high in fat. I don’t care for avocado either.

1518 2018-08-17 20:11:42 did they think you just fancied a swig of oil  yeah I'm 99% sure it's the reason I can't stand the smell of beer to this day 
1519 2018-08-17 20:11:34 It has a very earthy taste, somewhat bitter. To me I think it has an after taste similar to green tea. I'll be honest, CBD oil in general doesn't taste good, but it's for health so it's worth it. I really like to mix it in with my coffee with some cream n sugar.
1520 2018-08-17 20:11:32 Germany makes plenty of deals in buying gas and oil and coal from the gangster Russian state believe me and is Russians biggest foreign investor even now with sanctions and before sanctions were applied by the Eu France and Germany wanted soft sanctions this before MH17 got shot
1521 2018-08-17 20:11:19 Even though I live in Oklahoma, I’m continually surprised by the sexism I experience while getting my oil changed. Like dude,,,,just change my oil and stop telling me I should be out shopping

1523 2018-08-17 20:11:08 We went long gold and oil today
1524 2018-08-17 20:11:04 Johnny had been working in the Autoshop all day,
Mainly doing tune-ups on his bike and other stuff.

He was currently outside for a smoke break, a few oil stains on his Bullworth vest, but other than that he was pretty clean.
1525 2018-08-17 20:11:00 Bikes and scooters, as trip-extenders, will likely have a greater impact on the rate of future oil demand growth than personal car ownership (as you suggest). Ownership is still pretty sticky: to wit, EV adoption globally is moving at a fast rate.
1526 2018-08-17 20:10:50 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
1527 2018-08-17 20:10:42 getting an oil change after way too long because depression will really fuck you up
1528 2018-08-17 20:10:25 Price of oil has retreated about 13% since June highs. Doing the math - gas price was $1.55.9L at that time...so it should be $1.36... closer to $1.45 #fullgouge
1529 2018-08-17 20:10:24 The Darius Rucker cover of Wagon Wheel is on at this Jiffy Lube and this is why I should have just dealt with the heat and done the oil change and tire rotation myself.
1530 2018-08-17 20:10:23 CBD works great for my anxiety. I got the oil and you take 2ml every 4 to 6 hours. I recommend putting it in tea or juice because the taste isn't the greatest.
1531 2018-08-17 20:10:23 ナルルちゃんは素直で可愛いなー。誰かさんもあれぐらい素直だったらいいんだけどなー
1532 2018-08-17 20:10:21 Oil of Old Age 
1533 2018-08-17 20:10:12 I think you've contradicted yourself? The cheapening solar panels/storage will be gradually able to outcrowd dependence on fossil fuel. Technology spreads as affordability rises. And this is a technological problem, not one of a lack of wokeness on the topic of Big Oil or w/e. :)
1534 2018-08-17 20:10:07 Whatever....lol....big oil...
1535 2018-08-17 20:10:06 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
1536 2018-08-17 20:09:57 Have you ever tried vanilla-icecream with pumpkin seed oil? You really should! It sounds strange but it tastes soooo good!
1537 2018-08-17 20:09:42 I need a new oil diffuser.
1538 2018-08-17 20:09:07 "Dwink water nd use tea twee oil evewynight it will cure ur skin uwu" 

BITCH SHUT THE FUCK UP I WISH IT WAS THAT SIMPLE GODDAMN
1539 2018-08-17 20:09:02 Yeah!! I was just like ‘that didn’t taste right’ and they told me it was oil?? Oh bless you I can imagine that being so gross!!
1540 2018-08-17 20:08:59 I recently submitted a story for consideration that makes ample use of baby oil. Does that count? lol 
1541 2018-08-17 20:08:52 Longing bonds and awaiting for a break here, will create nice drop in stocks. Just curious what will be a root cause of that. Interest rates have peaked, oil has peaked, inflation is turning down. No way 10Y will go > 3.12% anymore ... low 1.00% or 0.00% is coming.
1542 2018-08-17 20:08:42 Typical curly hair routine: 
Wash. Not to often cause it’ll damage hair. 
Shampoo, but once in a while cause it’ll damage hair.
Condition. But without silicates cause it’ll damage hair. 
Oil. But not heavy oils because it won’t be absorbed. 
Step out, hair frizzes, kill yourself
1543 2018-08-17 20:08:14 Her songs plus candle light, plus wine, ....oil ??!! Wheeew Chile

1545 2018-08-17 20:08:08 If you’ve got a lady that adds too much oil to the food. Don’t get mad at her.

You should be mad at yourself for finding yourself with such a person.
1546 2018-08-17 20:07:55 People who steal from other people do so because they failed to prepare for their own future.
Our Government is guilty of that too. Since JFK days trying to pay the oil bill & got killed for it. Inside job.
1547 2018-08-17 20:07:54 And what are the populations of those two countries? Also for you eco-whackos, Norway built the largest investment fund in the world through pumping oil and gas.
1548 2018-08-17 20:07:52 The ALEUTIAN EXPRESS was an Oil Tanker involved in evacuating the islands during the Battle of the Aleutians. Named EXPRESS then and from 1929 to 39 was the ALEUTIAN NATIVE. Great story! More research awaits.
1549 2018-08-17 20:07:41 Lmao rather use castor oil 
1550 2018-08-17 20:07:34 essential oil pyramid schemes are a huge thing here and they put out all these crackpot (and maybe even harmful) ways to use their snake oil. its amazing that people believe it at all.
1551 2018-08-17 20:07:33 bio oil, jest w rossmanie
1552 2018-08-17 20:07:09 There is nothing great about nuking japan or the oil stealing fraud that followed 9/11. 

America has done many great things, but these 2 examples are the opposite of great.
1553 2018-08-17 20:06:45 I don't agree it has happened, but it will need to if we want to address climate change. Wood consumption has only increased over time. Same with coal, oil, gas. It has been energy addition, not energy transition.
1554 2018-08-17 20:06:30 She literally ain’t do shit but give ol girl a shave and then slapped some coconut oil on her shit 
1555 2018-08-17 20:06:12 Babe.... this guy confessed and told them where he put the bodies. He dumped those sweet girls in a oil tank to hide the smell of their decomposing body.
1556 2018-08-17 20:06:02 it was so dumb. this lady how had the oil is also the one that likes drinking lemon oil. and she was upset she didn’t have her roller balls with her. why do they believe this shit ugh.
1557 2018-08-17 20:05:53 Oil stain on one of my favorite pants & shirt 
1558 2018-08-17 20:05:36 Got a feeling you change the oil before it’s time to?
1559 2018-08-17 20:05:19 WTI oil on its longest weekly losing streak in 3 years.
1560 2018-08-17 20:05:16 holy cow! amazing oil work!!!!!! would love to see this irl ;__; 
1561 2018-08-17 20:05:09 I have cbd oil that I used on my knee but it never worked when I ate it
1562 2018-08-17 20:05:09 I gotta get a tire rotation, oil change, and an inspection 
1563 2018-08-17 20:05:04 I've bought it through Amazon in the past. Search for "CBD oil" using their search tool.

I'm really into this. I shall find you a link.
1566 2018-08-17 20:04:59 @zachmadkins zach. do you have an oil diffuser.
1567 2018-08-17 20:04:57 finally got some cbd oil, i cannot wait to see if it works :))))

1569 2018-08-17 20:04:53 Bought beard oil and avocado on the same day... fuck
1570 2018-08-17 20:04:38 @rico_hands the reason you will never beat the jews, is because you’re a coward hiding behind a computer.  All the oil $ in the world and you can’t defeat 14 million people.
1571 2018-08-17 20:04:37 What are the chances of some unwinding after China oil futures contracts (denominated in yuan and redeemable in gold) begin delivery this fall?
1572 2018-08-17 20:04:34 niggas is to loyalty as oil is to water.
1573 2018-08-17 20:04:32 Have so many muslin cloths now but thank you! And I got the coconut oil ages ago, lasts forever!
1574 2018-08-17 20:04:26 Be a terrorists, due to their oil&other minerals, crops the U.S terrorists want, the corrupted CIA&a future president ready to take Clinton'S, Obama's place, will get caught&summons our real military to fight their wars under the#TERRORISM!Thewill continue operating, SATANICS
1575 2018-08-17 20:03:58 Try doggie cbd oil. It helps with anxiety and being left alone.
1576 2018-08-17 20:03:57 Oil production exploded thanks to your favorite President....Obama.
1577 2018-08-17 20:03:53 just checked the oil in my jeep and dad was so proud of me 
1578 2018-08-17 20:03:28 Pure Distillate Oil  #Gelato
1579 2018-08-17 20:03:16 Oh. Pollution. Here we go. Do you guys ever stop to think about those  families who depend on the oil industry? Putting them out of work and home? There isn't enough of you buying lycra to subsidise them.

1581 2018-08-17 20:03:01 Trump is also selling off parts of our parks and trying to put oil rigs up and down the coast of both sides of the United States except where Maralargo is. He is allowing Alaska to be polluted. Why is he doing this if he is not getting financial gain? Cant see his tax returns.
1582 2018-08-17 20:03:00 @maerskdrilling I downloaded the game Quest for oil in the app store and I found another interesting app of Maersk -Virtual Rig Catalogue, when I downloaded the app was requested an access code.

How can I get it?

Thank you in advance.

Best Regards.
1583 2018-08-17 20:02:53 It’s almost 100 degrees outside and I’m changing the oil on my car

Pray i don’t pass out
1584 2018-08-17 20:02:49 I love green and blacks dark mint chocolate. That’s vegan I believe as it’s just dark chocolate and peppermint oil...delish!!

1586 2018-08-17 20:02:21 Trump wants an increased oil price (for the Saudi's interest), wants Putin to divide Europe (they would do it without Trump) and we are just supposed to take that shit... It is all about their own interest. Come on wake up...
1587 2018-08-17 20:02:13 Someone said decades ago that the wars to come wouldn’t be for oil anymore, but for water.

In fact, some sci fi writers predicted the shortage of water. Among them, the great Isaac Asimov which was not just a sci fi writer, but a great scientist.
1588 2018-08-17 20:01:56 Lol. Says the idiot who thinks there was a massacre at bowling green and that lies are simply alternative facts. Why does anyone give her a platform? She would say motor oil tastes like chocolate if paid enough money. She lies for money.
1589 2018-08-17 20:01:50 Is your regular lotion just not cutting it anymore?  If you're looking for a more moisturizing formula, try adding a few drops of vitamin E oil - it'll increase that moisturizing power and add in some antioxidants, too! #skincaretips
1590 2018-08-17 20:01:38 ok almond oil is amazing for that!!
1591 2018-08-17 20:01:37 I love how those shields are actually plastic oil drums. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works...
1592 2018-08-17 20:01:04 Yea, Mr. Excuses paid by the Osama Bin Laden BIG oil corporation owned by his family. Without that money those Saudi's would had never succeeded.
1593 2018-08-17 20:00:44 Part of a story I wrote in 2002, "[Cassells] went on to speak out against everything from police brutality in Grandview Park to the dangers of canola oil in Burrard Inlet, decrying the "artificial" salmon stream in Stanley Park, the Aquarium's importation of cetaceans..."
1594 2018-08-17 20:00:26 Baby muslin cloths cheaper and of as good quality. Aldi and Lidl do cheaper quality coconut oil.
1595 2018-08-17 20:00:22 Make sure your weed wasn't grown with Neem Oil. Lots of people use it cuz it's organic, but it still shouldn't be smoked. Look into the studies, it's usually wrongfully called Hyperemesis Syndrome.
1596 2018-08-17 20:00:21 "Moving in Stereo" by the Cars in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  I think a motor oil company used it recently.  Lame!
1597 2018-08-17 20:00:18 This Hyundai dealership tryna charge me $99+ tax for a synthetic oil change .. bitch what???? Not even my old dealership charged that much
1598 2018-08-17 20:00:06 I’ve tried coconut oil as a moisturizer but my skin is very oily as is and it just makes it worse  I use Pacifica brand moisturizing spray instead and it works well! I just have a hard time not wearing at least a base of foundation because I have terrible acne scars from HS

1601 2018-08-17 19:59:48 BC residents and AB residents are literally fleeing their homes because of toxic air and water caused by wildfires and oil. Smoke is spreading and reaching SK. Climate change shit ain’t out of sight out of mind anymore.
1602 2018-08-17 19:59:31 I'd buy your hand & body wash and some body oil, both in "the Meadow", and some Avo Mint lip balm
1603 2018-08-17 19:59:26 I sense he tried sarcasm...but only to try negate that what as citizens want and what is possible within our system are oil and water. Being worked up isn't a solution, "spreading" your vote leads to NMB situation.
1604 2018-08-17 19:59:24 And the same groups also criticize that oil.
1605 2018-08-17 19:59:11 These men just told me I might as well get a new damn car with everything that’s wrong with this one  and all I could say was “can you just change my oil?” 
1606 2018-08-17 19:58:51 See my Bae
1607 2018-08-17 19:58:29 Daily Caller is a big fan of pipelines to make oil companies more money at the expense of the American people.
1608 2018-08-17 19:58:17 Sodium bicarbonate drop.... disolve the wax. Oil never works in this house
1609 2018-08-17 19:58:14 So is this how the #Pioppi diet goes:
Breakfast: Coffee with butter, no sugars.
Vape some natural (real) tobacco.
Morning teaspoon: extra virgin olive oil.
Lunch: water
Arvo tea: cheese
Etc
1610 2018-08-17 19:58:13 Think I'm gonna attempt a gluten-, dairy-, tomato-free pizza later w/ mushroom, spinach, onion, pear, smoked applewood bacon, dairy-free mozz, olive oil, cauliflower crust. Pls wish me luck, we hungry out here 
1611 2018-08-17 19:58:05 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

1613 2018-08-17 19:57:48 Laura.  It’s only unconscionable if you don’t use the blubber for bug repellant, or to light your home with the oil, or to lubricate your farm equipment or.....    do they even taste any good?
1614 2018-08-17 19:57:41 I liked Pete Axthelm better personally....but snake oil and wooden wagon wheels are a bit insulting to the marketplace in 2018
1615 2018-08-17 19:57:38 Getting oil all over your favorite fox hat >>>
1616 2018-08-17 19:57:30 My parents just looked at me and didn’t even stop me from doing it even tho they knew it was oil??? It was not pleasant
1617 2018-08-17 19:57:14 Stop using palm oil...
1618 2018-08-17 19:56:52 I love how cbd oil has helped me and so many others. I can honestly say I wouldn't get through each day without it. Anyone on this page that has doubt, click on Rosies link and order. YOU will be absolutely amazed.
1619 2018-08-17 19:56:47 Awak pakai lagi elianto cleansing oil tuu ?
1620 2018-08-17 19:56:32 Since ‘buck-a-beer’ has been such a resounding success, perhaps Ford should ask the oil companies to sell gas for $1/L in exchange for some free exposure.
1621 2018-08-17 19:56:28 Seen this beard oil for men on The Body Shop’s website and I wish I had a boyfriend to buy it for 
1622 2018-08-17 19:56:25 Ground flaxseed. While eggs make the best breakfast, you can make a great “porridge” (oatmeal to you guys) from ground almonds and ground linseed/flaxseed, then a bit of almond butter and coconut oil, pumpkin/sunflower/sesame seeds and whole milk etc for an occasional treat.
1623 2018-08-17 19:56:16 I suggest you read on subject of Constitution as being a document of negative rights. 
Obama referenced this at one time, though his understanding and or explaination was 180 degrees out of sync. You seem on same path
1624 2018-08-17 19:55:49 Top in billion oil reserves (Barrels) do you know that Venezuela's economic is more devastating than Nigeria's own?
1625 2018-08-17 19:55:30 Oil is subsidized. Where are you going with this?
1626 2018-08-17 19:55:20 Leslie, we have the perfect recipe to help with the pickle smell! 

In pickle bucket mix the following:
 
1/3 Cup Bleach
1/3 Cup Murphy Oil Soap
1 Gallon Hot Water
1627 2018-08-17 19:55:13 Taxing money wasting fool that protects everything that is against the grain of Californians. Your train is the worst idea ever.  Big oil must have a desk next to yours.
1628 2018-08-17 19:55:04 CBD Oil?
1629 2018-08-17 19:54:53 I vape, and am sure it is at least not as bad as smoking, but feel the laws are ok as they are. Society has pet hates and trends though, and I am not in favour of over reaction... 2nd hand, it is probably no worse for you than burning Jos sticks or  scented oil burners
1630 2018-08-17 19:54:45 Today I condensed a years worth of schooling on oil paint to two pages of point form tips. Not sure if I’m impressed or discouraged 
1631 2018-08-17 19:54:33 Also, I tried to take at least one class each semester (including summer school) that would be on the bar. This made studying for the bar less-daunting. I also found out that way that I actually liked oil & gas law!
1632 2018-08-17 19:54:30 i’ve been doing dad stuff like going to bed early and reading books and doing oil changes
1633 2018-08-17 19:54:21 I disagree.
No more riding the fence time.
Shit or get off the pot time.
All or nothing time.
Make sure your oil jar is full time.
 "What do you do when I rap on the tank?!
Get some! Get some! Fire at will!!"
1634 2018-08-17 19:54:20 I cried in front of 5 French adults because I’m so tired from not having slept well all week, worried I was going to have an allergic reaction from the peanut oil that was potentially in the dinner, feeling a bit ill and a bit overwhelmed so took myself to bed for everyone’s good
1635 2018-08-17 19:54:15 • apply moisturisers with natural oils such as reosemary or almond oil 
• try using same family products.for example a toner, scrub and cleanser from the same brand 
• try a detox 
• try coconut oil ( DOESNT work on everyone’s skin) 
• Get your daily dose of vitamin b,c,d
1636 2018-08-17 19:53:59 I've never made it before today! It was pretty easy; you just boil the tomatoes down with oil and garlic and spices! I'll probably do it again, was pretty yummy
1637 2018-08-17 19:53:49 あめにうたおうやっぱりすき
1638 2018-08-17 19:53:48 I expect that will be true for coal and oil for the foreseeable future, too.
1639 2018-08-17 19:53:45 Basic economic principles are only "lies" to those who are ideologically blind. The US is producing cheaper, lighter oil. It is more economical.

I'm sorry if you can not or will not grasp that reality.
1640 2018-08-17 19:53:43 Lol I prefer heavy hitters but aint they some of the only few suppliers that have 100% oil? Cause other brands mix they shit with vape juice lol

1642 2018-08-17 19:53:38 I need an oil change but i don’t feel like going to get one 
1643 2018-08-17 19:53:36 *picks up car from oil change
Mechanic: “you’re car needs new breaks, new engine, new lights, new tires, new windows, and it’s getting ready to blow up as soon as you leave the facility. We can do all that for you right now”
Me: “nah Im good I’ll take my chances”
1644 2018-08-17 19:53:29 Na palm oil I see o! With meat Yoruba stew I guess 
1645 2018-08-17 19:53:13 working on birthday dinner/lunch for my boyfriend, gonna bake a cake later uwu

cooking carrots, onions, and beef tips with worstershire sauce and some oil, very simple but good
1646 2018-08-17 19:52:56 So he turned the light on and added oil?
1647 2018-08-17 19:52:56 Best oil is Russian because it sources from a very cold freezing temperatures which keeps the nutritions locked in the oil ! Your car runs longer on russian fuel and the engine last longer !!!
1648 2018-08-17 19:52:49 Big ups for freaking about oil companies not devastating fisheries.
1649 2018-08-17 19:52:45 Montreal Steak and Olive oil is all any steak ever needs
1650 2018-08-17 19:52:43 I am getting an oil change at a dealership because I don't know how and three middle aged women are laughing hysterically watching Ellen and we are pretty much America.
1651 2018-08-17 19:52:38 Strongest ibuprofen. Corsydil mouthwash. Or for immediate effect tea tree oil on a cotton bud
1652 2018-08-17 19:52:06 Too bad you can't eat oil.
1653 2018-08-17 19:52:00 My favorite Munch pic, because the filter makes it look like oil pastels on canvas.
1654 2018-08-17 19:51:55 Well good for them! One more reason to move away from Oil dependence from them!  I have spent lots of time all over the Middle East, years in fact. I didn’t notice too many fields of plenty.  Oil doesn’t taste very good. 
1655 2018-08-17 19:51:30 @Jim_Bakker sell sell sell you do not teach the gospel oh you teach the gospel of Jim Bakker sell sell sell!!!!!! You are disgusting to the Lord Holy Oil when did Jesus use “holy oil” you charlatan bastard!! You’re sickening!!!

1663 2018-08-17 19:50:30 What are the options besides spraying with oil or paving?
1664 2018-08-17 19:50:27 Yes when the oil market crashes and a country who relies on it suffers, it's the fault of socialism, apparently.

1667 2018-08-17 19:50:22 You got me. Every fact in there is completely made up. My view about Tesla and its CEO are totally wrong too. Just very lucky to be rolling in money today because @nytimes is in on the FUD-train. We are getting paid by big oil. No problems at Tesla at all, user named Read or Die.

1670 2018-08-17 19:50:12 Thanks so much for being vocal about nuance here. [Pulling from olive oil vs. MCT replacement data, elevated levels of EITHER increase my LDL-P. You know better than I that typological thinking has plagued this discussion for too long, and SNPs are part of this, too. Thank you!]

1676 2018-08-17 19:49:54 Mr. Kenney was bragging about Leduc not very long ago, somehow forgetting that the Liberals got busy making a way for AB's new oil to get out of the province.

1685 2018-08-17 19:49:16 No oh my god ive gotten close but never done it  oh my god?? When I was a kid I drunk oil thinking it was apple juice in my defence it was in a water bottle and why would oil be in a water bottle
1686 2018-08-17 19:48:58 Venezuelian communists forced labour people dig up holes soo deep that they could suck the oil from the Arabian reserves !
1687 2018-08-17 19:48:52 Some companies sell it cheap but I don’t know how reliable they are. Some have been busted selling plain old oil. I went with a small bottle of Purple Power coconut oil from BuckyLabs just to try it. They’re one of the reputable labs according to Clif High. But yeah, $$$.
1688 2018-08-17 19:48:49 Gill actual just asked can u put olive oil in your car when it says change oil 
1689 2018-08-17 19:48:46 No more unregulated area of the US economy over last two decades than tech.   Yet somehow Google and FB now enjoy a digital advertising duopoly.   We learned this lesson before, see Standard Oil. Network effects make it worse. Yet forgetting history helps make ideologies tenable.
1690 2018-08-17 19:48:31 It’s a cougar here at the oil change place that can get it lol

1693 2018-08-17 19:48:15 I busted my ass when I slipped on some spilled oil at my mans shop last night and this nigga can't stop replaying the surveillance video that captured my fall to everyone he comes in contact with. MF even went as far as adding background music to it

1697 2018-08-17 19:47:51 Governor commits to diversity by mixing Chili oil and mung bean
1698 2018-08-17 19:47:51 where would the entire defense industry be without government contracts and subsidies, also companies like ibm, ge, oil, gas, farming sectors? people love to talk about smaller government and bash subsidies until their livelihood and causes they support are affected.
1699 2018-08-17 19:47:49 Hey remember when you didn’t know how many amendments to the constitution there are?  You don’t take the incompetence cake, you take the whole bakery. You’re too much of a stable genius to have daily intelligence briefings, because, you know, you and intelligence = Oil and water
1700 2018-08-17 19:47:49 I can’t believe that you would be so calloused to Texans hurting in an industry you supposedly know so much about. You must know all the firings that occurred. I am not saying oil is the only glue to the Texan economic fabric, but it did effect MANY people who now have jobs again

1702 2018-08-17 19:47:26 (Suez + Panama) ship less oil than Hormuz.
Iran has treatened to close Hormuz.
this is a wild card risk, but its a factor that does exist and cannot be ignored
1703 2018-08-17 19:47:26 1. Drink a lot of water (substitute soda for water & minimize the level of sugar consumption) 

2. I wash my face in the morning with cetaphil soap & in the night with oil of Olay soap. 

3. Sleep.

4. I don’t wear makeup often and when I do my brushes/sponges are always cleaned.
1704 2018-08-17 19:47:18 I can be... Mom, Dad, maintenance, housekeeper, partner, lover,friend,fam member. I can be so many ppl but I jus want to be one. I can't take on so many rolls. I'm one person. Even machines need oil an love. Or they shut down
1705 2018-08-17 19:47:08 Ground your brain, think of one thing you can hear, see, touch, and smell. Even if you can only hear yourself tapping and touch your arm and smell your hair it’s slightly distracting. I carry an oil too that has peppermint and lavender for a smell that’s more relaxing
1706 2018-08-17 19:47:08 Oil change, tire rotation, vacuum, and car washed all for $45

1711 2018-08-17 19:46:52 If you look at a $1 bill closely, you’ll see it’s covered in reptiles! George Washington was a robot powered by steam! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
1712 2018-08-17 19:46:50 What is the press?  Low talent schmucks who can't make it in the business world who think they are smarter than everyone.  Nobody cares !!  As a whole, the least likable, least entertaining, most annoying group that I have ever witnessed.  @cnn @JohnJHarwood @cnbc @FoxNews
1713 2018-08-17 19:46:28 They don’t have plain oil and vinegar?? Rude!

1716 2018-08-17 19:46:09 Are you a mayo snob? I know someone who won’t go to a restaurant anymore because they only offer olive oil mayo. I can’t tell the difference.
1717 2018-08-17 19:46:04 @BegumNadiya love your current programme. Have you considered using Lotus type biscuits that don’t have palm oil in them. Sadly the makers are decimating the orangutan population!
1718 2018-08-17 19:46:00 Brought my laptop to get my oil changed. Finished some college work before I even started the class. I'm thriving

I am so done with oil (fossil fuel). I want to be on the right side let’s do it what do we need to do?M
1721 2018-08-17 19:45:44 We should change our thoughts and expectations on oil. 
Many other alternatives at our disposal more than oil.
1722 2018-08-17 19:45:44 Disagree on one point. Rigby/Sky didn't fail. They succeeded in what they set out to do. It's just that what they set out to do was pour oil on the flames, not water. All in their owner's interests.
1723 2018-08-17 19:45:38 Just wash your hair ever 2-3 days, gets some coconut oil (in the little spray bottle) and something for No Frizz and just run both thru your damp hair every time.. I promise that shit will grow & look so good when it drys too. 
1724 2018-08-17 19:45:37 I mix Apricot oil with Cherry Blossom lotion and my skin is so soft
1725 2018-08-17 19:45:36 Guy,why is it that you always have something negative to say about every development? I've observed closely,its not a good trait,learn to see things from good angle .
1726 2018-08-17 19:45:36 '.....ignoring their advice and doing whatever my oil industry benefactors tell me to do. You know, a typical weekday.'

1728 2018-08-17 19:45:24 Where do u expect the govt to get money for d projects? 2 out of 3 years, this Admin was only able to sell 700k barrels against 2.2m blw $50/b. Y don't u ask wat GEJ used a whopping N56trillion he made from oil during his term n compare projects
1729 2018-08-17 19:45:20 I’ve literally never had an oil change take longer than 20 minutes lol. they’re in there breaking something so you gotta come back and get it fixed
1730 2018-08-17 19:45:12 is there such a thing as mens shampoo that isnt also conditioner and body wash and hair gel and motor oil
1731 2018-08-17 19:45:09 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

1734 2018-08-17 19:44:56 We saw it all happening, some argued against it, but still it went ahead in the name of oil and big money.
1735 2018-08-17 19:44:44 Oil Man went insane from Jupiter ...
1736 2018-08-17 19:44:40 We need holy oil, nothing less.
How do you fail to score against 10 men?
1737 2018-08-17 19:44:37 Wait, can anyone do these? Neat.
A young boy finds himself trying to balance a pan of hissing oil over the fire while his dad runs to the car for the kernels. Can he keep it level?

1738 2018-08-17 19:44:36 Totally forgotten fact....the entire debate about oil really can't be had in the West anymore and it's a real shame. There is institutional intelligence to be learned from the industry and the politics has gotten in the way of any useful debate on the topic.
1739 2018-08-17 19:44:34 That's heart healthy canola oil right there, pure deliciousness
1740 2018-08-17 19:44:18 You shpuld question where our wealth as a country (Top Tip it was stolen through empire from India whilst starving Ireland almost to death also taking oil from Scotland more recently) We really dont have a history to be proud of.
1741 2018-08-17 19:43:59 So @SecretaryZinke thinks SEAL is easier than Interior because he could shoot back. Terrorists use fear to achieve outcomes. Zinke appears to want to shoot female questioners. And female Senators?Are you a terrorist Big Oil Man? Maybe you and I should talk-Anytime. #insiderthreat
1742 2018-08-17 19:43:33 Do you ever think about people who cook topless for Instagram  favs and how dry their pans must be to avoid little oil scars
1743 2018-08-17 19:43:23 I actually thought I did
1744 2018-08-17 19:43:20 I am also fond of the term "snake oil salesman" LOL
1745 2018-08-17 19:43:08 Are the #America n’s intending to preserve the Venezuelas’ oil for the #us future by paralyzing the use of it now so when the worlds oil is depleted, then the Americans invade Venezuela and parasite on its oil?!!!
1746 2018-08-17 19:42:53 You still need an oil change
1747 2018-08-17 19:42:43 It’s pretty slimy in its unfried state be forewarned. Gram used to slice it lengthwise and drop it into hot oil. Then salt if after it came out the fry. Sometimes she’d coat it in cornmeal too that was yum. I hope you can find some and try it!
1748 2018-08-17 19:42:42 I’ll smoke flower if it’s good but I’ll smoke a quarter a day vs like a gram of oil but I’ll never turn down flower that’s passed to me

1792 2018-08-17 19:38:05 we are, that's just it, almost all canadian oil and gas companies are spending money on energy efficiency and green technology. On top of that, money form the Climate Leadership plan is going back into businesses that are exploring this technology.

1817 2018-08-17 19:34:27 @realDonaldTrump it must definitely do that, a further delay in oil sanctions, weaknesses It is unacceptable. There is no justification, Iran's oil can easily be completely cut off by November and should The work to be done. President Trump complete the job

The more you deprive your skin of moisture the more oil and sebum it will produce. Causing your oily skin to be way more oily.

1823 2018-08-17 19:33:59 @realDonaldTrump It's time to give the Iranian regime more lives and more killing of the people of the Middle East and the torment of most of the people of Iran. When it comes to completely shutting down Iran's oil until November

1829 2018-08-17 19:33:24 @realDonaldTrump I would never like to tweetie on the boycott of oil, but it is very important for us, it is important for all the true Iranian loyalists. We say that when it comes to halting Iranian oil by November, why should it be delayed by another three months?
1830 2018-08-17 19:33:12 I really wish people would stop suggesting CBD oil to me. Sounds amazing, even though it sounds snake oily. I just don't have $60

1875 2018-08-17 19:27:45 We would recommend that you add one drop of an essential oil or baby oil to the dried Dipbrow Pomade.

1909 2018-08-17 19:22:25 I was thinking of Saudi Arabia mainly but I think there are some other oil producers in that same region.
1910 2018-08-17 19:22:25 I doubt it. They probably want some stimulation after the oil boom tho. There is a generous amount of government corruption & weird laws. A few years ago, they fined people $250 for possession and shame-published their names in the newspaper while driving tickets were only $20.
1911 2018-08-17 19:22:14 Preger U video quoting Obama on key role for strong fathers taken off Facebook. Lots of Arab oil money still around.
1912 2018-08-17 19:22:12 Conscription to police, fire and ambulance help the services under pressure. Constructive work in their communities. Or alternatively let them think for themselves and pick their own career path. Definitely not cannon fodder, fighting for oil.
1913 2018-08-17 19:22:02 ask about the oil cartel in PR!! ask about why even with technology they do nothing to catch the people who steal the service,include non payer municipalities and gov offices! theres no  will in PR! half of the bill is to cover all the above! expect more charges to cover more !
1914 2018-08-17 19:21:52 Your opinion is noted and ignored because it does not actually fit the facts. 

Global demand is irrelevant to the fact that shipping bitumen 5000 kms across the country is not economical at current prices and with the US shale oil boom.

1920 2018-08-17 19:21:35 Cracking up because everyone at the oil change place has on an Apple Watch 
1921 2018-08-17 19:21:05 Because. How instructive for people in Alberta, command centre for the oil sands industry, to be the sink for much of the smoke. A little #climatechange with you Alberta beef, anyone?

1924 2018-08-17 19:20:54 I was just joking about their oil fields in the North See!
1925 2018-08-17 19:20:46 Finally invested in oud oil and wow if a babes don’t faint smelling me I’ll be surprised
1926 2018-08-17 19:20:39 My step dad & mom have started using it. They both have severe pain that it’s helping with but my step dad also has ptsd and anxiety and it’s helping tremendously for that also! If you’d like I can share the link of the oil they’re using
1927 2018-08-17 19:20:39 So when Turkey stops the flow of Iraqi oil hurting its economy throughout the 90s you say good dog! And when Turkey doesn’t stop importing gas and oil from its energy rich neighbor Iran you say bad dog! Nice, I think what us wants is obedience not partnership, you made that clear
1928 2018-08-17 19:20:21 Do you have access to cbd oil?

1930 2018-08-17 19:20:01 I think the true nose sticking will come from Saudi Arabia’s earnings charts diving straight down after Canada stops buying oil from @Saudi_Aramco and EU Members and other countries follow suit.
1931 2018-08-17 19:19:58 Getting my oil changed and tires serviced . Will ride like new money now

1939 2018-08-17 19:19:01 Yes! Make sure it’s just lavender and not a blend oil is best .
1940 2018-08-17 19:18:57 Oh I just use straight up coconut oil lol.
1941 2018-08-17 19:18:55 I am interested in the oral CBD oil, I had purchased one locally that was without a flavor but it had a somewhat sweet taste, how does your unflavored taste.
1942 2018-08-17 19:18:44 omg who started the rumour that i drink olive oil

1945 2018-08-17 19:18:29 55 Yemeni people were killed last week, a bus full of 40 children were killed this week. History will not look kind on us as we choose Saudi oil over humanitarianism. The American view of Human Rights should not dissipate for the greed of a resource.
1946 2018-08-17 19:18:14 Nothing makes an edible kick in faster than an old guy angrily criticizing my choice in motor oil in line at the gas station.
1947 2018-08-17 19:17:53 So coconut oil straightens my hair like I wanted, but makes my already oily hair look greasy and wet all day Can I just say it’s the Kim Kardashian wet look?

1950 2018-08-17 19:17:27 1/

A business move this large carries a multitude of economic considerations. Amazon can't just pick Juneau AK as the new HQ, for a variety of obvious reasons. Remote location, infrastructure, education level of residents, effect of oil prices on the local economy..etc
1951 2018-08-17 19:17:20 psst sorry if i'm stepping in rudely- but the whole film was actually rotoscoped over live action footage, which may explain the uncanniness. and yes, i believe they hired oil painters rather than animators!!
1952 2018-08-17 19:16:57 Read the original tweet. Modi hasn't achieved that kind of growth in 4 years and would not in 5th year too based on projections. Why? No economic crisis to contend with, oil prices half of that as during UPA rule.
1953 2018-08-17 19:16:41 More:  "Democracy Now! and its staff have received several journalism awards, including the Gracie Award from American Women in Radio & Television; the George Polk Award for its 1998 radio documentary Drilling and Killing: Chevron and Nigeria's Oil Dictatorship, on the ...
1954 2018-08-17 19:16:29 Pipelines are about 95% underground. Even if they weren't, indigenous people need oil and gas (and the products created from it) so they have to bear some of the inconvenience like everyone else. They also get compensated like everyone else.
1955 2018-08-17 19:16:18 Rub lavender oil on your temples. You can get it at larabee herbs in EP.
1956 2018-08-17 19:16:13 These multitudes of religious vampires would suck the oil of favor off your life and leave you as dry bones if you didn’t put the price of their humanity on the anointing oil. 
1957 2018-08-17 19:16:08 It's a relief that exponential growth of technology including solar price/performance seems to progress independent of political policy. Could turn out to be a saving grace. It's telling that the oil juggernaut Saudi Arabia invested $200 billion in solar this year.
1958 2018-08-17 19:15:39 My coworker “My cars at 100k I think I should start doing synthetic oil”
My pharmacist “no no after 100k you stop using oil all together” 
Ah yes

1960 2018-08-17 19:15:19 1. The Gulf Wars were, in part, about oil.
2. 1 is true regardless of how much stock the soldiers happened to own in ExxonMobil.
1961 2018-08-17 19:15:11 I'm sure Trump and Prince think "Gee, if we privatize the war, we get to keep all the oil."

Trump back in 2015: "I’ve always said, shouldn’t be there, but if we’re going to get out, take the oil."
1962 2018-08-17 19:15:09 Another oil change complaint tweet.
The average fee for a synthetic oil change seems to be about $80 that's insane. I should really just learn how to do it myself
1963 2018-08-17 19:14:56 vic my hair is an oil slick bc u told me not to wash it for the bleach ur FINE
1964 2018-08-17 19:14:50 Like Dynasty, but with hair oil, cardboard walls and hillman imps.
1965 2018-08-17 19:14:49 One straight day no light,I wonder who we have offended like this @IkejaElectric
1966 2018-08-17 19:14:48 Which, to be clear, is into a vat of boiling oil lol
1967 2018-08-17 19:14:47 Sad you got oil in your country, america trying to suck that out
1968 2018-08-17 19:14:44 Me and my dad put oil in his truck last night
1969 2018-08-17 19:14:41 We don't have any problem with you but the hands of all US presidents who come after JFK are bloody
They can destroy all humanity for a little bit of oil, a little precious metal
1970 2018-08-17 19:14:14 It's because it makes their oil look dirty.
1971 2018-08-17 19:14:04 The issue last year wasn't the #6 spot.  The issue was Klef & Lars injuries, and Benn sophomore slump until later in year.  First 5 slots of Oil (with Sek out) should be viewed as vets now, not youth pushed too fast.  So youth in 6 slot not the make or break.
1972 2018-08-17 19:14:00 Looks great. Had a friend recently tell me that OLIVE OIL was a bad choice for grilled meats. Something about smoke or burnn threahold. Said go BUTTER. Take it or leave it.
1973 2018-08-17 19:13:59 your asbestos lamb of my lamb oils softer their empty oil sucks
1974 2018-08-17 19:13:50 Getting pushed back to easily by their pressure game. Oil needs men around him and we have the idea players in McKay and asoro but they need to move off the flanks to be affective. If they move off the flanks, Olson and Roberts can find space wide. Then brum have to think again!
1975 2018-08-17 19:13:47 You can find a smaller bottle of the cold pressed rosehip oil for a cheaper price to try. You literally only need a few drops on your fingertips and you press it into your skin  after cleansing. Also make sure u exfoliate 1-2x a week to keep dead skin cells from building up
1976 2018-08-17 19:13:34 All I ask is for an oil change...if I needed your opinion on anything else about my car then I’ll ask but if you don’t tighten up that cap and pass me my keys...
1977 2018-08-17 19:13:24 Socialising
1978 2018-08-17 19:13:24 I may regret this, like when I eat too much chocolate, but what's Crossroads Motel? Is it like Dynasty, but instead of the cutthroat oil business it's the cutthroat world of the budget hotel?
1979 2018-08-17 19:13:11 @saudiarabia’s actions right now are appalling. @JustinTrudeau and @cafreeland need to convey to the Saudis that images of a 9/11 on Canadian soil like those shown in Saudi Media today are unacceptable. We have enough of our own oil anyways. Time to stop relying on the Saudis.
1980 2018-08-17 19:13:07 Jamaican black castor oil a couple times a week, leave in over night! Works wonders
1981 2018-08-17 19:13:04 I guess you do not understand the analogy! It's funny you mentioned "polarization"! There are two reasons oil and water cannot mix:
1. Water is denser than oil
2. Polarization
Polarization exists whether you like it or not! It is our differences that make it difficult to mix!
1982 2018-08-17 19:13:04 5) Just be a customer at first. It's natural & later on maybe add some CBD oil of your preference.

I'm walking w/o canes, taking my grandson & great-grands out to the park. Not doing cartwheels, but down to ONE mild pain med. NEVER thought this would happen!
1983 2018-08-17 19:13:02 How cow, do you realize thousands of people lost their jobs????? This is a comment so void of understanding, empathy and facts I can’t believe it. Please look up the oil industry in Texas. Also no that isn’t all, but you need to inform yourself about your fellow Texans
1984 2018-08-17 19:12:52 ohhhhh boy yes
1985 2018-08-17 19:12:50 Christians are only deceived by the angel of light because of a lack of fresh oil, which is the fault of poor leadership in Christianity. 
1986 2018-08-17 19:12:47 Also: Alberta (home of the Canadian oil sands) has had a broad carbon tax since 2017. Started at $20/t (US $15), now $30/t (US $23).

1988 2018-08-17 19:12:33 Maybe u need an extra oil in ur tweets
1989 2018-08-17 19:12:15 The oil works fine! Lol... I told him the same thing you just said about the balm.
1990 2018-08-17 19:12:11 Where is that oil hanging?
1991 2018-08-17 19:12:06 Rubbed some Punkin butt teething oil on Andrew’s gums and he immediately stopped shoving his hands in his mouth 
1992 2018-08-17 19:11:58 It was in a waiting area while I was getting my car’s oil change.
1993 2018-08-17 19:11:42 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1994 2018-08-17 19:11:25 Coconut oil.
1995 2018-08-17 19:11:22 I just dropped my car off at Chevrolet for an oil change and the worker goes, “You look like a college student.” 

I don’t really know if that’s a good thing or not.
1996 2018-08-17 19:11:22 Sir, Nifty, Bank Nifty & Crude oil is governed by which planet movement, if can describe would be very helpful.
1997 2018-08-17 19:11:15 Well i guess you have to google a bit, but its just apple juice etc and on the last day olive oil and epsom salt. GL
1998 2018-08-17 19:11:07 I want an essential oil machine that diffuses whisky into the air I breath #thisis26
1999 2018-08-17 19:10:52 when you get your car back from getting an oil change and tire rotate and everything is still in the green  i take care of my baby bc she gone ride
2000 2018-08-17 19:10:46 #Gold is still undecided about the further direction of going against commodities & oil. Yawn.
2001 2018-08-17 19:10:46 I’m irritated. When they started work on it, they found they didn’t have some basic bits, like the seal for the new oil filter. Had to be ordered in overnight. Stopped work on it meantime, meaning it wasn’t ready to collect today, and will only be done mid way through tomorrow.
2002 2018-08-17 19:10:38 Of course we would be in the EU. Let’s see oil, fishing grounds and oil and already being compliant with all EU directives etc
2003 2018-08-17 19:10:37 Venezuela isn't socialist, they wouldn't be doing so bad if the US and oil companies weren't holding them hostage, and Sanders isn't a Marxist. All of these are obvious, well-documented facts. You're just a dishonest fucking fraud.

2006 2018-08-17 19:09:41 I didn't know about the global consumption of palm oil ...
2007 2018-08-17 19:09:39  Won’t be too long away let’s hope Not too bad tbf just an hour.....boarded now..Typical tho booked a later flight hoping for last day to cook in  oil but it’s been  all day  So could of done an earlier flight as would of been unpacked & eating takeaway now X
2008 2018-08-17 19:09:27 You'll always be ok in an independent Scotland, because although we need England and their jam more than anything in the world, we'll find a way. It'll be hard with our wind farms, our oil, our fruitfarms, our decent clever people, our whisky, but somehow we will manage.
2009 2018-08-17 19:09:25 Hi, you are super gorgeous =3  I was wondering sense you love plants if you have heard of the Arnica plant and the oil they make from it, its amazing on bruises for deep penetration....lol that sounded naughty 
2010 2018-08-17 19:09:23 I’m burning the midnight oil  
Exhausted is an understatement
2011 2018-08-17 19:09:15 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
2012 2018-08-17 19:09:03 Isn’t it too much of a gluttonous sin to baste steak with olive oil?
2013 2018-08-17 19:09:01 Stopped for an oil change on my way to the Real Estate office today and they didn't put the cap back on. Found out after about my second turn towards the office, so now I get to make a return trip after work!
2014 2018-08-17 19:08:53 Went in for an oil change and somehow they end up telling me I need a new tire #how
2015 2018-08-17 19:08:48 What's clear is: limiting production has substantial local environmental benefits. @Stand_LA is doing great work on this front. Seems like the clear win on public health should be enough reason to support oil restrictions even if broader GHG/geopolitics story is unclear.
2016 2018-08-17 19:08:47 I'm sorry, but I disagree. Both peanuts & cashews have too much oil in them. They give me heartburn.
2017 2018-08-17 19:08:44 So i understand all the extra shit women put in their hair....My lil girl gonna turn 4 soon, her hair is long, and me tryin to bush em...shampoo just wont do! You need balsam, oil...and its time consuming!
2018 2018-08-17 19:08:11 Waiting to get a oil change 
2019 2018-08-17 19:07:55 
Lol
You no drink the anointed oil?
Use am make Eba 
2020 2018-08-17 19:07:51 Yet they have partially hydrogenated soybean (gmo?) oil. Since tootsie roll was invented before PHO, and it’s bad for you. Why use it now??  What used to be in the original recipe in place of it?? Hmmm
2021 2018-08-17 19:07:43 Solution-gas drive is not on the list & is the main drive mechanism for tight oil plays. Here, dissolved gas in the oil expands & drives oil to surface. Depletion drive is different & involves reservoir compaction.
2022 2018-08-17 19:07:37 Onions and olive oil.
2023 2018-08-17 19:07:07 Lol to the guys changing my oil today, I am so sorry.
2024 2018-08-17 19:07:03 DON’T go to Jiffy Lube across from ULM’s campus for an oil change. It’s dead ass highway robbery and they don’t even mention their student discounts
2025 2018-08-17 19:07:03 Oil is back strong due to Trump cutting regulations that’s a fact. Pants and manufacturing are benefiting as well. Look up the oil industry under Obama. It was decimated, now back 
2026 2018-08-17 19:07:03 The okra is in search of oil
2027 2018-08-17 19:06:51 @elonmusk You’re gonna be just fine. Maybe try CBD Oil instead of the ambien?  Let’s also talk about the “hempdustrial revolution” and also our water issues here in Southern a Oregon. Call me, maybe.
2028 2018-08-17 19:06:45 so, re the lemon and pepper, when should I expect my box?
2029 2018-08-17 19:06:40 What, it's bad to drain aquifers to collapse so you can inject it into other dirt to break out oil? Hrm...
2030 2018-08-17 19:06:24 Who would’ve thought land locked North Dakota would have a significant salt water spillage natural disaster issue?  destroying farm lands by 1000s of acres...Byproduct of oil boom!
2031 2018-08-17 19:06:21 Me that was even using  the anointed oil to bathe 
2032 2018-08-17 19:06:12 Oil.....is that it?
2033 2018-08-17 19:06:05 Your head is like an engine, without engine oil. This home video is too funny
2034 2018-08-17 19:06:00 @SenatorBurr you should know better. Allowing the stripping of  #Brennan clearance is oil on a slippery slope. #trump now taking vengeance on Ohr. To say I am disappointed with you is an #understatement. Stand up for #Patriotism now!
2035 2018-08-17 19:05:50 I don't mean to be harsh, but there's a certain element of "duh" here.  Culturally, London is increasingly like oil and water, as are other parts of Europe.  There are just some realities in life.  Homosexuality gets a death sentence under some religious cultures, and can't mix.
2036 2018-08-17 19:05:49 CBD oil has changed my life.
2037 2018-08-17 19:05:47 Castor oil and coconut oil making my skin look so flawless
2038 2018-08-17 19:05:44 yes dude I wake up and there be maaaad oil there 
2039 2018-08-17 19:05:38 May Allah swt guide him to the right path.
2040 2018-08-17 19:05:27 *Yes they did
2041 2018-08-17 19:05:22 Next time pour anointing oil on your belly 
Baby go fear inside sef 
2042 2018-08-17 19:05:11 Came in for a simple oil change & tire rotation, walked out with a laundry list of things needed to be done to my car 
2043 2018-08-17 19:04:40 ใครทำแฟนนนนน //เดี๋ยวแม่ตบเรียงตัว #แฟนครับเงียบหน่อย
2044 2018-08-17 19:04:35 the corporation tax bonanza from oil & gas is long gone. prob a billion or two a year at best, but offset by tax incentives to invest. and of course the tax payers money needed to subsidise decommissioning. so wont plug the spenf=ding defeicit black hole i'm afraid 
2045 2018-08-17 19:04:10 Dynamite puts out oil well fires.... What about dropping a MOAB in the rural areas to wipe out large fronts of the fire? #anormaldayinrussia
2046 2018-08-17 19:04:07 Sept. WTI oil gains 45 cents, or 0.7%, to settle at $65.91/bbl
2047 2018-08-17 19:04:01 It’s about control of oil. Reserves count as assets for investors. Cutting production acts as a regulator for raising the value of a barrel. Uncle Sam may have destroyed Iraq just to limit their production. Venezuela is another country that has suffered from foreign interference.
2048 2018-08-17 19:03:44 I still need to get my oil changed..
2049 2018-08-17 19:03:44 Cbd oil is the truth 
2050 2018-08-17 19:03:42 I'm actually due for an oil change! Thanks for the heads up pal
2051 2018-08-17 19:03:39 My next topic for debate: ‘essential oils’ are the new snake oil, and the pyramid schemers are inherently exploitive. Change my mind.
2052 2018-08-17 19:03:38 We all told them to NOT ACCEPT OIL,GAS COMPANIES B.S. ! Their greed got in the way of being farmers!! Now they live with huge losses!
So does rest of US!!!
2053 2018-08-17 19:03:26 I love the Italian chips and salsa AKA bread and oil/vinegar
2054 2018-08-17 19:03:20 #Crudeoil up 66  now. Watch #oil stocks #Drillers $ESV $NBR $NE $RIG ETC
2055 2018-08-17 19:03:16 Oh really? They're your life? Please. If they were your life you wouldn't of killed them and hidden their bodies in oil tanks.  rot in hell!
2056 2018-08-17 19:03:09 That pineapple vinaigrette I just made was like nothing I've tasted before. The coconut oil made the difference. Salad was like a damn piña colada
2057 2018-08-17 19:03:02 I also wanna know how companies in oil and gas, manufacturing, logging, auto handle these relationships with their end users. 

We have a bad habit of only looking within our own industry for answers when there are things we can learn from elsewhere.
2058 2018-08-17 19:02:56 You see a heel to be my oil fluttering.

2060 2018-08-17 19:02:26 Ok he put regulations on oil that caused thousands to be fired! I know this for a fact. With regulations lifted the jobs are back and hiring. You may hate Trump, but people of all color and creed are benefiting from regulation and tax cuts. Look into Texas oil!!
2061 2018-08-17 19:02:15 What would you do differently to support the Alberta oil and gas industry?
2062 2018-08-17 19:02:11 My husband as well. He's rarely sat in his 30 plus years in the oil and gas industry.

2066 2018-08-17 19:01:42 Tell the Saudis to go drink camel juice. I am sure there is a big demand for maple syrup in Europe. May God help her find some better clients who will respect her and our country.  We should stop importing oil from there. Let us go to Iran for oil.
2067 2018-08-17 19:01:29 I’m about to be the biggest bitch to these people at Nissan. Like 3 hours for an oil change and tire rotation?? Fuuuck this shit
2068 2018-08-17 19:01:27 Lol don't be stingy ooo
2069 2018-08-17 19:01:23 Business men are evil, I KNEW IT. 

Seriously though if they keep it up we're gonna run out of oil sooner then they think and who will be to blame? Them probably.
2070 2018-08-17 19:01:16 For me oil and filter changes, spark plugs, replace a battery and brake pads..oh and a tire
2071 2018-08-17 19:00:41 Spray them down with Murphy’s oil soap...it works!
2072 2018-08-17 19:00:40 Nice response. Limiting oil production in CA also comes with the added benefits of limiting all the other pollution associated with it, including wastewater management, air quality and health related.
2073 2018-08-17 19:00:27 Sure! I use vitamin C products - moisturizers . I exfoliate three times a week and I wash my face morning and night ( never miss it) and vitamin e oil to sleep. Sunscreen daytime too haha

2078 2018-08-17 18:59:58 Excuse me, Norway’s trillion  dollar sovereign wealth fund was built on oil. It’s like sayings 90 of Kuwait’s wealth is privately owned. They loan it all out but the collateral is oil.
2079 2018-08-17 18:59:48 From my experience with my family high paying jobs in oil, plants, manufacturing! Trade skills which pay a lot are hiring!! I am so grateful! My family was suffering in the oil industry and now jobs are back. This is no joke. God bless Texas 
2080 2018-08-17 18:59:43 Black don’t crack a lie, they just be diving in an oil drum of lotion every 15 minutes
2081 2018-08-17 18:59:29 The problem is the people with the $$$ that run the world are doing all they can to keep us dependent on oil. Alternative energy isn't lining their pockets. It isn't a coincidence that gas prices have been creeping higher and higher since our scumbag president took office.

2083 2018-08-17 18:59:14 Is that right? How many companies in the oil & gas sector have gone into receivership in the last three years? People who work at those companies aren’t feeling much support.
2084 2018-08-17 18:59:11 Dis gal too grown to be smelling like motor oil 
2085 2018-08-17 18:59:10 Gave 20% of America's Uranium to Russia. Never did anything to Russia when all this hacking was happening when he was president. Trump on the other hand went full tilt on oil, hurting Russia's economy. Told Germany to stop buying Russian oil. Gave Ukraine heavy weapons.

2087 2018-08-17 18:59:03 has anyone ever figured out a way to pour cooking oil out of the bottle in a way that the outside of the bottle isn’t covered in oil?
2088 2018-08-17 18:58:54 I hope that is not code for letting companies come in and drill for oil and cut down the forest. We need to preserve our national parks and forests!!! @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner
2089 2018-08-17 18:58:36 The entire global economy had a shook. Oil market crashed and all oil dependent economies suffered. What are you saying?
2090 2018-08-17 18:58:34 Also, fins. 

The color is not a Ford thing, it's the livery of the sponsor, Gulf Oil.

2093 2018-08-17 18:58:10 My friend from a Very rich background will be taken to Rehab today at Zaria on the pretence  that they'll be going to purchase rams,I shed tears seeing him leave,guy refused to be serious with his life after all the things his parents do for him.
I feel so pained 
2094 2018-08-17 18:57:59 You hearing it here first but if you replace your oil filter with a Coffee filter, you’ll get at least 25% increase in performance
2095 2018-08-17 18:57:53 Im Scottish id die for my country yes. As should any patriot. The first job of a patriot is to protect society from its Government ,as when Governments become tyranny, rebellion becomes duty.die for a Tory elite scum?Hell No! Or none of my English sons. No oil wars for Rothschild
2096 2018-08-17 18:57:49 I need an Illuminator that’s bronzed, this illuminating oil is great but my skin is shouting at me
2097 2018-08-17 18:57:45 The Trudeau gov is corrupt. Shut’em down bring back Canada oil production and fair pricing. All oil comes out of the ground and is dirty. Only stupid environmental lib tards play games with public knowledge and awareness.
2098 2018-08-17 18:57:37 Is she mad that nobody is asking her about all of the other things that make her interesting and worth taking to?

It's like a dysfunctional middle eastern dictatorship getting mad that we only care about their oil and don't ever just hang out. Yes, that's all we want from you.
2099 2018-08-17 18:57:33 Not sure oil pulling actually does anything but I’m gonna try it out for a while
2100 2018-08-17 18:57:21 Probably easier to just let it burn. Then it would be easier to drill for oil and INCREASE our rate of climate change. Keep up the good work, Zinke. America will NEVER be great with you in charge!

2108 2018-08-17 18:56:06 It won't be too bad. You'll feel lethargic for a few days. Got lots of TV and films to watch? Someone to cook for you? (Also cannabis oil is amazing, shhh!)
2109 2018-08-17 18:55:52 I like my job. Oil industry.
2110 2018-08-17 18:55:49 Have you tried CBD oil? I had chronic hip and knee pain. 3 months ago I started taking CBD oil. Today I am pain free. If you want more info contact me. Hope you’re feeling better.
2111 2018-08-17 18:55:49 1. @anasalhajji #crude_quality_matters

Since 2014 these have been the average % of imports as a % of refinery throughput of crude oil.

2014 46.8%
2015 45.6%
2016 48.6%
2017 47.7%
2018 47.3%
5 year average 47.2%

Last 4 weeks at 46.1% is a difference of 1.1%
2112 2018-08-17 18:55:48 Here's how much crude oil Texas has left: If Texas were on it's own and the borders sealed, gasoline here would be 10 cents a gallon. Which is not necessarily a good thing! ;-)
2113 2018-08-17 18:55:35 People pray for cake but when God gives them oil, butter, eggs, a pan and an oven they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.
2114 2018-08-17 18:55:23 Toms lavender. I think I bought lemongrass too. Coconut oil works pretty well too
2115 2018-08-17 18:55:20 Thanks Ang. I'll heat up the oil right now.
2116 2018-08-17 18:55:15 Millenials can kill mayonaise, golf, and chain restaurants, but they can't kill nazi's, big oil, or capitalism... C'mon guys pick better targets 
2117 2018-08-17 18:55:15 So I’ve just used beard oil on my hair to smooth it after straightening and I tell ya what girls, it’s works a fuckin treat
2118 2018-08-17 18:55:13 
2119 2018-08-17 18:55:11 Went to the store to grab some oil. As I was queuing I realized the 2 dudes in front of me were old classmates.
They looked like grown ass men with a job and a house. 
Then realized I probably look like a grown ass woman too. 
Died inside a little bit. 
Being 23 is weird.
2120 2018-08-17 18:54:58 Pool noodle and coconut oil
2121 2018-08-17 18:54:57 Try less oil, when beard is wet, then beard balm. Will still have the fresh and clean look, not greasy.
2122 2018-08-17 18:54:50 tomato & cucumber salad with salt and pepper and oil definitely is great

2124 2018-08-17 18:54:39 Oil and Gas is a male dominated industry . You and your labour  comrades don't care about young men who cant find jobs.
2125 2018-08-17 18:54:37 Coconut oil and conditioner!
2126 2018-08-17 18:54:37 I have it! I liked it for about two weeks and then I started getting super tiny red bumps under my eyes in patches so I stopped using it and found a cream I liked better. Also, it smells like fish oil. But I’ve seen some people that LOVE it who’s skin didn’t react that way.
2127 2018-08-17 18:54:29 I need to get my oil changed in my car ;; I dont wanna do anythingggg
2128 2018-08-17 18:54:11 Damn she is a socialist....hates free press...socialist support nationalism of press, mfgrs., oil companies, and private property, banks,....this idiot hates Trump because he supports Capitalism and free press!!

2136 2018-08-17 18:52:51 To make the lies come out smoothly. To oil the lying machine.
2137 2018-08-17 18:52:51 If he comes to your house again,  heat some cooking oil and fry his ass. This is heartbreaking! 
2138 2018-08-17 18:52:27 you smell of lies and oregano oil
2139 2018-08-17 18:52:15 Yeah mang, you need potent RSO.
That's what I need for extended trips/kicks. Good Rick Simpson Oil lasts for hours. Edibles ain't enough get you a decarboxylated extract. That's at least 68% that's 680 MGs
2140 2018-08-17 18:52:14 What a wonderful day of strolling. Cedar wood and cypress oil were invaluable to treating a wound and just settling down to some organic cocoa banana and peanut pie , with pitted dates and sunflower seeds #rebellious chips and mixed vegetable cakes . 
2141 2018-08-17 18:52:06 After undoing your braids: 
1. Heat up your oil mix a bit and then apply to hair. Leave for 1 hour to overnight 
2. Shampoo and condition 
3. Heat up deep conditioner and leave for more than an hour using a plastic bag/shower cap

This should help bring back the moisture faster.
2142 2018-08-17 18:52:06 lemongrass essential oil, it's radically effective :)
2143 2018-08-17 18:52:06 Nothing but respect for my tattoo artist. He just had surgery and was asking about CBD oil bc he doesn’t want to be on opiates. I guess when you live in the heart of heroin ODs you kind of stay away from the one thing all the people addicted to it started on - pills.
2144 2018-08-17 18:52:05 You say "make the accountable" like they matter. Clowns running around crying about biased news coverage like there is any other kind. If you think you've ever read or watched or listen to a news report that wasn't biased... you're just an idiot.
2145 2018-08-17 18:52:03 I make it like fried rice. Add some egg,chicken, sauteed onions and carrots use soy sauce and sesame oil
2146 2018-08-17 18:51:58 Halfway through getting my oil changed and I realized that I don't have my wallet.  #Oof #PanicFeeling
2147 2018-08-17 18:51:46 CBD oil can drastically help some people.
2148 2018-08-17 18:51:44 Estoy re gedienta de joda esperando a que Maju salga del psicólogo  o que loli me venga a buscar a la oil de la familia.  Lo que pase primero.
2149 2018-08-17 18:51:35 Just because you have a good oil pressure does’t mean the oil is getting where needs to go. Prevent deposits by using your local rickshaw or if necessary even Uber.
2150 2018-08-17 18:51:31 Use the sesame oil, salt and pepper mix to dip the belly
2151 2018-08-17 18:51:25 Remember the mother and child scheme in 1950s. Popular blame was put on bishops but it was the medics who manipulated the bishops as they would lose out financially. In UK Bevan stuffed the medics mouths with gold to start the NHS (with malayan tin & oil from iran)
2152 2018-08-17 18:51:24 I wouldn’t say it gives the same effect as coffee but I take it with fish oil pills and stay hydrated and I don’t feel the need for caffeine. I would try it
2153 2018-08-17 18:51:17 @mohalsulami Hi,   With all that oil money for decades, why has Saudi Arabia never created a great University.  Their Top is 201 to 250th in the world.  Islam has such a inspiring history of teaching and learning, giving the world so many things we now take for granted.  SO WHY?
2154 2018-08-17 18:50:47 The feeling of spraying olive oil on after is the one... #chromedome

2162 2018-08-17 18:49:31 “All or Nothing” tries to paint @ManCity like some underdog team that won the league when they essentially bought the league with a warchest provided for by Oil Mogul Sugar Daddies! You want to make a football documentary #Amazon, make it on @LCFC and their miracle season!
2163 2018-08-17 18:49:20 Hey a leave in conditioner to use every day or every other day before putting your oil mix or spray with water before the oils. 

Deep condition after washing and after taking down braids do this :

2170 2018-08-17 18:48:03 I cannot tell you how much I agree with this. I lost over 45kgs doing different things. I prefer high low gi and raw at that,  moderate protein and essential efas (not bottles of coconut oil); different things work for me at diff times. Done with the excessive butter etc. 
2171 2018-08-17 18:47:57 I wash my hair once a week.
And use a mixture of coconut, jojoba and castor oil, daily or every other day. I just undid my braids, and I wasn't really taking care of my hair so I'm paying for it now.

2176 2018-08-17 18:47:07 @elonmusk Huge Tesla fan here. Shouldn't you be concerned about the Saudis killing Tesla, significantly reducing its funding or limiting the vision for the company in order to give oil a longer life? They have quite the financial incentive to stop Tesla's mission

2191 2018-08-17 18:45:05 I'm sorry but not being a leader in sustainable tech is not only an economic issue it is an issue of national security. I don't day trade, I look at the big picture. I'm not ok with the US losing the race. Oil is finite. Why is that so hard to understand?

2197 2018-08-17 18:44:26 there's ACtually the powdered one..  That's the one without palm oil.

2203 2018-08-17 18:43:48 I can't smoke due to COPD but use the oil & it helps with my fibro pain. I am in a flare right now & out of oil & money but when I  have it it sure helps. Hope it helps you this pain is horrendous.

2206 2018-08-17 18:43:13 I’ma start slapping castor oil on my eyebrows because this shit is for the birds.
2207 2018-08-17 18:43:08 I completely agree about the urgency of action. But to me that means defending the federal carbon price floor against attacks from Scheer, Ford, and Kenney; pushing to accelerate it; and persuading other countries to follow. Trying to block the oil sands seems like scapegoating.
2208 2018-08-17 18:43:07 Those rules you speak of - are called regulations.

Without them we have market crashes and recessions.

We have pharma abuse

We have catastrophic oil spills

Part of growing up is learning how things work - i suggest you try harder.

2209 2018-08-17 18:43:07 Thank you!  The infused oil makes them over the top!
2210 2018-08-17 18:43:02 Acting like they weren’t getting bamboozled by literal snake oil salesmen
2211 2018-08-17 18:42:26 Still using oil ? What's the point aside from burning millions of litters for the pleasure to go fast ?
2212 2018-08-17 18:42:14 He may act like YOU, selling snake oil to rubes, but he does not act like me, or any decent person.
2213 2018-08-17 18:42:02 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
2214 2018-08-17 18:42:01 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2216 2018-08-17 18:41:41 Meh. It’s just logic. No oil. Just common sense.

2235 2018-08-17 18:39:26 Trump called climate change a hoax.
The thing is, the US (and others) built their wealth based on oil and coal. We cannot allow other countries to do the same because this would destroy the planet so we have to help them
2236 2018-08-17 18:39:23 Dear Exxon. Please stop selling oil to liberal cities! This will save us all a lot of heart ache and you will get your point across much faster. Thank you

2241 2018-08-17 18:38:54 OMG! Oil sold at over 60USD when @MBuhari came? What a distort of fact! So, when @atiku left, who and what party took over? And how much did he sell crude oil? How much did he leave in the foreign reserve&how much did he borrow? Pls, do not distort the facts to earn follow back.
2242 2018-08-17 18:38:48 We don't have gas or oil. Our house is heated by electric heaters or wood. You know those gas shortages and powercuts...or the awful weather that stopped the oil man coming? Never effected us.

1. @JanetJackson came out with a new song and video
2.@ArianaGrande came out with a new album 
3. I got off at 11am today 
4. Changed my oil and filter in my car 
5. Hanging with some friends later 

Days like this are what counts 
2245 2018-08-17 18:38:43 I disagree and believe competition will emerge via better business models and better technology. There may be a monopoly now, but just like oil, it will not persist forever. Do you operate miners?
2246 2018-08-17 18:38:08 Did an overnight coconut oil mask last night. Hair feels amaaaazing today.
2247 2018-08-17 18:38:06 This woman took my car for an oil change and a wash while I was working today>>
2248 2018-08-17 18:38:02 I love that direct deposit.... but it’s so sad that my car takes it all  she just got an oil change a new air filter, tire rotation, and soon a car wash ..... she’s so worth it.
2249 2018-08-17 18:38:00 Thanks Jimboman! No doubt this is heading to 50, then 38 
2250 2018-08-17 18:37:57 Hazel wrote a good blog post on it. Apart from the general political awfulness the whole THING of Saudi is the OIL which... Is the opposite of FE philosophy.

2251 2018-08-17 18:37:49 For soup, cook diced shallots in oil, then simmer with lamb, dill, mushroom broth and spinach. Top with pickled jalapenos.
2252 2018-08-17 18:37:34 It depends on the car you can check the manual for intervals and oil type. I think chrisfix has a video on oil changes that will cover everything.

2266 2018-08-17 18:35:52 They have next to no oil Walsh....look at the RNS....how much revenue is being generated from condensate sales?
2267 2018-08-17 18:35:48 While I take climate change very seriously, I don't understand the argument that withholding supply  will be effective at reducing global emissions. Oil-importing countries will just buy their oil elsewhere. The price of oil won't even rise, because of OPEC.
2268 2018-08-17 18:35:42 Nah vegetable oil we go use

2276 2018-08-17 18:34:59 The situation would have to be Win Win.  Everyone would have to get something nice.  Palestine need a Port to allow them to trade their olive oil with the rest of the world.  Israel need space to live.  Holland reclaimed land from sea.  I don't see why Israel couldn't do the same
2277 2018-08-17 18:34:57 Well, then PLEASE demand all Greenpeacers stop using oil products. Thank you, Mike!

2281 2018-08-17 18:34:30 Sure. Energy transition means, say, shift from wood to coal or coal to oil. Has happened. But, as you rightly note, they're never complete, in that, say, burning wood never went away completely

2291 2018-08-17 18:33:59 Do you realize how overly simplistic that statement is?  It’s laymanspeak of casual observers, but it doesn’t represent reality, and the two are as disimilar as oil and water.

2293 2018-08-17 18:33:57 When US did airdrops of munitions to the YPJ in Kobane to help them defend against ISIS they gave false hope. Turkey were openly allowing IS use their border and were buying their oil. USA can right their wrongs now by dealing with Turkey.

2297 2018-08-17 18:33:29 Mr. Train, when India bought crude oil @$110 a barrel, govt was still collecting excise.  Tell me of one budget when the FM said he had no money.  Today the army is being told to buy their own uniforms because the govt. can't afford to??  AND MY HEAD IS BURIED IN SAND?

2300 2018-08-17 18:33:09 Instead of having only oil resources, like Venezuela, covering the cost of a social Democratic platform.. you would have the GDP of the United States. It could make for such an amazing Country but, the People have been brainwashed for decades believing a social democracy is evil.

2312 2018-08-17 18:31:52 Some were much closer than they should have been. Hatred is a strong motivator and these leftists are VERY motivated.  I have seen complacency set in when things are going well. Always fight like you're losing and never take victory for granted
2313 2018-08-17 18:31:49 Centuries ago, people used to own oil paintings and art as a measure of class and pride. Not much has changed today, except the artwork is no longer in oil and instead is an iphone x phonecase of hansol vernon chwe in that yellow beanie, round sunglasses and olive green shirt. 
2314 2018-08-17 18:31:46 Uh oh, the one I use starts with canola oil.
2315 2018-08-17 18:31:39 Every time I go to get my oil change, these guys try replacing half my car. If I wanted a new car I’d go to the Toyota dealership down the road. These guys take my car out back and drill holes in my tires so I’ll buy new ones.

2317 2018-08-17 18:31:30 It's also extremely dishonest to blame Venezuela's GDP growth on its economic system because the issue is that 96% of its exports is oil and the vaule of it has dropped since 2013. The problems of the country come from forneign capitalists, not state ownership.
2318 2018-08-17 18:31:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but evaded justice.
2319 2018-08-17 18:31:05 This is a hotly debated topic. Mayo acts like eggs and oil essentially. There are recipes out there to search. I've had a choc cake made with mayo and was pretty tasty.

2324 2018-08-17 18:30:31 Perhaps  @DavidHTorrance needs an assistant? He could certainly use one.
2325 2018-08-17 18:30:28 Also, I think I need to add just a touch more oil to the sauce. With the thickener, I think that could help with it emulsifying a little and give it a nice richness when spooned judicially over rice.
2326 2018-08-17 18:30:25 It’s my experience that polemicists rarely bring anything good to the table. Conflict resolution is about all sides making difficult concessions in order to arrive at an irrevocable peace accord. The polemicist merely pours oil on flames.

2333 2018-08-17 18:29:47 Their own master puppeteers have raped the earth of resources for centuries in profit (oil).  Then they are told to say the straws are about the environment.  The complete lack of recognition and rationale in mind control is fascinating.  It’s all about meticulous control.
2334 2018-08-17 18:29:47 Dear #Congress you do know the "bill from hell" does not hurt Russia contrary it helps Russia. Russia is producing record high oil and getting even more rubles for it.
2335 2018-08-17 18:29:45 It only gets crazier as you get older.  I was checking IDs at a roman bacchanal (18+ only) my s/o threw last week (the oil and gold covered naked male wrestlers were *amazing*) and I nearly turned away someone with a birthday in 1999

2337 2018-08-17 18:29:38 The import content of exports will definitely reduce to some extent the "net gain" from higher exports. Energy imports tend to be quite inelastic but in this case if financing is very tight we might see a drop in oil imports

2347 2018-08-17 18:27:54 I never thought that sesame oil tasted like peanut butter, but then I had some sesame oil that tasted *exactly* like peanut butter and now all sesame oil tastes a little like peanut butter to me. #Neuroscience
2348 2018-08-17 18:27:39 Try this recipe for a fun summer ice cream. Ingredients: 2 cups heavy cream,1 cup milk, 2 TBL vanilla extract,1/3 cup coconut sugar,1 to 2 drops lemon oil, and 2 drops lavender oil. Place all ingredients in blender and puree for about 10 seconds. Freeze in ice cream maker.
2349 2018-08-17 18:27:23 I think it helps to say you don't mind getting oil on whatever you have on. I keep my underpants on, bra off but the masseur always offers to give me the bra and walks away before I turn around

Hi Maria,
can you ask friends/staff for dentist recommendations? Otherwise, googling „best dentist makati“ comes up w/ some well rated ones.

2418 2018-08-17 18:18:19 Turns out Nicolas Sarkozy had been bribed €50 million by Gaddafi in 2007, he was the one that lead the effort to overthrow him with UK/US, looking back with Cameron’s name in panama papers, plus the Clinton foundation and the SoS’s giddy reaction, I doubt he was the only bribe

2474 2018-08-17 18:10:45 no egg required, you can do this also with nut milk and oil.  Vegans make our own mayo all the time. So easy, customizable (amount of salt, mustard, sugar or not, spices or not, etc.) and way cheaper than buying it.
2475 2018-08-17 18:10:41 ahaha same here!! it's like magic. I use Aunt Jackies Don't Shrink Flaxseed Elongating Curling Gel and some shea butter leave-in conditioner I got from Walgreens, and sometimes I swap the cond. for some coconut oil grease I like
2476 2018-08-17 18:10:36 I swear I been here getting this oil change for a hour 
2477 2018-08-17 18:10:35 Me, sitting in the lobby waiting for my much needed massage: So nice to have a day off. 
Job #2 Boss: G called in. Can you come in to work?
Me, annoyed but also taking a deep inhalation of this essential oil infused room: I'm not available! Sorry!! :(

Cos..for real...I'm not.
2478 2018-08-17 18:10:33 I assumed it was because fossilized organic matter = oil, but I had never heard about this before, holy shit
2479 2018-08-17 18:10:30 The organization is structured very poorly; Wikileaks proved that certain countries are manipulated with Arab Oil and vote against Israel; such as Brazil. Also, U.N elected Saudi Arabia of all states to Women's Rights Commission. Most states who vote against are mostly Arab/Mus.
2480 2018-08-17 18:10:30 Damn yeah they’re more than likely looking at other shit with your car. Just be stern about you only coming for the oil change, because I notice the difference when I got with and without a man with that.
2481 2018-08-17 18:10:18 My uncle posted a video on facebook about black seed oil. After doing my research, I tried it because it's supposed to be good for chest congestion and IT IS.

2488 2018-08-17 18:09:35 Except frr
2489 2018-08-17 18:09:29 If the oil industry actually had to pay for the damage they caused, we’d live in a much better world right now. Avoiding responsibility and having other people pay for their messes is the only thing that keeps their current business mode profitable.
2490 2018-08-17 18:09:27 We'll start making soup with Nigeria's crude oil very soon.
2491 2018-08-17 18:09:09 But procrastination and forgetfulness is my middle name. I just remembered that I meant to tweet about the wonderfulness of black seed oil.
2492 2018-08-17 18:09:04 it’s the only oil with molecules small enough to mimic your natural sebum 
2493 2018-08-17 18:09:02 :(( rub it w oil and elevate it !!! then tmr then see how!!
2494 2018-08-17 18:09:02 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

2501 2018-08-17 18:08:38 No one should ever be buying mayo. Soybean oil is terrible for you but 100% olive oil mayo is not only cheaper than storebought soy mayo, it's healthy as well.

2511 2018-08-17 18:07:15 You are a bad ass of the veggie world, particularly when roasted in olive oil.
2512 2018-08-17 18:07:13 This is my son’s head.. He was hit on the back of his head. I put our Miracle Oil on for a few days and it healed nicely. This oil has safflower oil and several other oils that work great on cuts, nights, burns, rashes and so so many other things!
2513 2018-08-17 18:07:12 I am not rejecting his opposition to Trump proto-dictatorship. I am pointing out that he helped staff the regime for oil money. He used to be a public servant, and now he is a lobbyist, a member of the oldest profession.

2515 2018-08-17 18:07:01 Haha, it's gotta be terribly low.  But the price will be his NRA money divided by # of Texas schoolkids.  I'm sure it's pennies.  Cruz and Cornyn both sell off Texan's interests for very little.  They're cheap whores!

Anyway, make the soup. It's a bit of a pain in the butt, but worth it.
2525 2018-08-17 18:05:15 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
2526 2018-08-17 18:05:10 My sinuses are so swollen that the only plausible relief I can get is if I slice my face open. Rubbing peppermint essential oil all over my face and neck will just have to do.

2529 2018-08-17 18:05:02 As many times as I’ve gotten my oil changed myself I still don’t know how to pop my own hood
2530 2018-08-17 18:05:01 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?
2531 2018-08-17 18:05:01 Any diet can shorten your life if it's comprised of crap. In this case, if low carb means chicken wings, CAFO beef and vegetable oil it probably isn't doing you any favors.
2532 2018-08-17 18:04:55 If CNN publishes an article, will anyone even read it?
2533 2018-08-17 18:04:51 that was beautiful you have a way with words
2534 2018-08-17 18:04:44 How? Oil doesn’t drain that quick!

2537 2018-08-17 18:04:36 And even when the gov't executes capital projects, they quickly fall into disuse. Three giant oil refineries...and the country still imports more of its fuels (until Dangote's complex goes operational).
2538 2018-08-17 18:04:35 @elonmusk Have any utilities expressed interest in Tesla's battery storage systems or home builders for backup power? Or maybe big oil to diversify into alternative power? Seems that many forget Tesla is more than just cars.
2539 2018-08-17 18:04:25 Clearly a hangover from his dharna days. Having got him elected, the boyz can now focus on elocution lessons.

2561 2018-08-17 18:02:20 2/ ...the fuel lines to the carburetor's two float bowls seem to ascend from someplace below the intake manifold, down by the oil pan. So, maybe the pressure tank acts directly on the carburetor? You tell me! 
2562 2018-08-17 18:02:18 Did I just read that the two lil girls were found in an oil and gas barrels?!  And they "strongly Believe" they're the bodies of those two beautiful baby girls?! If they don't know for sure. My God what kind of shape were their innocent little bodies in?!!
2563 2018-08-17 18:02:16 Mr. Bernier had openly expressed his thoughts on diversification  unlike current leadership of the conservative party. But to openly express ones thoughts doesn't make It right.  Stop the polarising  and work towards the common good. We are not oil and water we are all Canadians.
2564 2018-08-17 18:02:14 Gotta know these things. Then other women are like, WTH, how do you know that? You're so smart.

2573 2018-08-17 18:00:54 those oil stains kind of sold the scene for me
2574 2018-08-17 18:00:53 Hi Janet, as you may know, 80% of the world’s palm oil comes from Malaysia or Indonesia. We work with @RSPOtweets and directly with our suppliers to ensure their practices are in line with sourcing best practices.

2586 2018-08-17 17:59:21 Would have taken me like 40 minutes, usually. Most of that is cussing at the jack/jack stands and waiting for the oil to drain

2599 2018-08-17 17:57:56 OH geez. You don't know about the tough sanctions Trump put on Russia. Trump was the one to do something about Syria, he is strangling Russia's oil economy, he sent weapons not blankets to the Ukraine, he has killed over 200 Russian military in Syria, and more.
2600 2018-08-17 17:57:43 Let's take it, the "port" of Mombasa is like the oil in Turkana. The coast people should be given their portion of the "port revenue". What the judges should be looking into is what percentage.

2612 2018-08-17 17:56:13 No. I’m not sponsored by oil, big gun or pharma - more’s the pity, though. If they are interested in courting my good opinion I’m definitely open to offers.

2616 2018-08-17 17:55:34 #Keto day 4 - got my pantry staples in from Amazon:
Almond butter
Almond flour
Dark cacao powder
Ghee
Macadamia nuts
Monkfruit sweetener

Already had almonds, coconut oil & coconut flour. What keto essentials are in your pantry?

Gonna be trying #fatbomb recipes this weekend.
2617 2018-08-17 17:55:33 You are so wrong. Try telling the Norwegians or the Saudis, or the USA, that their oil belongs to international oil companies and not to them.

The companies are licensed to extract the oil.
2618 2018-08-17 17:55:31 Private sector down because of oil price slump. Self employment up.  Government jobs are better that welfare.  Keeps people in Alberta. Keeps other businesses going.
2619 2018-08-17 17:55:26 i swear that if my dad puts olive oil on my pizza again, someone will die in this house.
2620 2018-08-17 17:55:17 Vabbè dai il solare è quasi nullo! Eheheh
Gli specialisti dell’oil and gad son ben remunerati e son pochi ma il mio punto lo hai capito.
È importante creare settori che creino indotti ad alta specializzazione e sistemi di educazioni e training. Circoli viziosi
2621 2018-08-17 17:54:55 1. First it was GEJ that caused PMB's failure.
2. Then it was drop in oil prices;
3. Then it was corruption fighting back;
4. Then it was the Libyans/Chadians/Nigériens;
5. Now it is #Saraki that caused his failure!
Common denominators? 
PMB ≈ FAILURE

2623 2018-08-17 17:54:36 The world in private jets using up tons of gas and oil and flying barbers from France to LA just because they had to look good for a party.  Lol many more too it’s just bullshit
2624 2018-08-17 17:54:29 It’s amazing how many restaurants talk the talk but don’t walk the walk. Many use disgusting, bottom of the barrel Olive Oil and Balsamic. It’s crazy.
2625 2018-08-17 17:54:28 Terry, if Canada must ‘grow’ it’s fossil fuel production to help the world to transition to clean energy, why shouldn’t the rest of the world increase its oil production also? How will this end well, except for short term profit for oil companies?

2631 2018-08-17 17:53:33 it looks kind of like an oil flask to me, specifically like a machine/gun oil bottle, but i'm not sure
2632 2018-08-17 17:53:33 Are not these same tech gurus asking the major oil companies to supply the world's energy in a completely carbon-free manner? Doesn't that mean removing ALL oil wells, refineries, gas stations and other assorted infrastructure from the planet?
2633 2018-08-17 17:53:18 Don't tempt me. I'll get some cornichones and oil cured olives to go with this bitch.

2636 2018-08-17 17:52:47 How I HATE that this fucking ball of rancid oil actually comes to the Yukon to kill OUR wildlife. Greasy bastard: go to ALASKA & murder some AMERICAN beauty... America first, right? I wish the Canadian border authorities would fina a way to ban this goof from our nation...
2637 2018-08-17 17:52:44 The Dutch East India Company maintained dominance over Asian trade by it's mercenary army.

I recall Shell Oil has been protecting it's Nigeria delta oil interests with a mercenary army since the 1970s.

It's a business model that's at least as old as pimping.

2643 2018-08-17 17:52:00 @StoneFoxCapital they are paid to smear.  Oil owns CNBC.   Speculating about drug use.  Unreal.

2646 2018-08-17 17:51:22 It's about time Iran and Iraq sold oil in any other currency but dollars. Other OPEC  countries should follow suit.

2653 2018-08-17 17:50:44 So your position is global oil demand not going up and USA and Norway not ramping up production to meet this demand? 
2654 2018-08-17 17:50:41 Really really glad I levelled cooking on day 2 before they removed Aromatic Fish Oil from the cooking vendor.

2659 2018-08-17 17:50:20 Our @TheMillieCat had arthritis but lived a long and happy life. She was prescribed Viacutan Capsules - 500mg, which has fish oil, and Seraquin (800mg tablets) which has glucosamine, chondroitin and curcumin. Ask ur vet if he can have these, they were a big help to our Millie. 
2660 2018-08-17 17:50:13 I’m hoping she’ll be done before me as my car is being worked on at the dealership and I overheard her saying she was getting an oil change >.<
2661 2018-08-17 17:50:11 This is so criminal! 1) thicker batter for a more fluffy thicker pancake. 2) no vanilla extract! 3) you don’t make a pancake in bacon grease maaaan... cooking oil! Let it heat up and pour in the mix. A crispy edge and a fluffy moist center = perfection. Then load on the butter!

2672 2018-08-17 17:48:54 Problem is, the US has very little use for Syria's oil and gas. In fact, most of the ME has little use for it. The Leviathan Gas Field makes it insignificant.
2673 2018-08-17 17:48:53 ...but they’re actually not the same. One has added butter/oil. The other doesn’t. Waffle batter is also thicker.

2679 2018-08-17 17:48:07 @WSJ (to which I subscribe) what is with the constant badgering of @Tesla? I get it, you’re conservative and love old-school oil companies. But really, Tesla is the only car company on the planet doing anything interesting right now. That’s it.
2680 2018-08-17 17:48:02 Them being reliant on oil was a mistake, you're absolute right
2681 2018-08-17 17:47:28 What you can also do after you shower, cleanse your face etc use hydrating oil it’s supposed to help with dry skin and usually I use it at night since I’ll use moisturizer during the day but I don’t really think the time period matter it’s all optional
2682 2018-08-17 17:47:25 Belly band over my stomach, sheep skin oil on my nipples, a ( beautiful ) alien stabbing my insides...........safe to say I’m officially a mom.
2683 2018-08-17 17:47:21 I need to start putting castor oil on my eyebrows. Tired of filling them in 
2684 2018-08-17 17:47:21 West must also benefit from China being supplied with cheap oil. Oligarchs around the world are allied against the little people.

2686 2018-08-17 17:46:49 With alk the area that have bountiful and often too much water I always thought we should have pipelines like we do for oil.  Pumps out the flood water send it to somewhere on a drought....

2688 2018-08-17 17:46:39 The extreme need to vote for true progressives that do NOT take corporate money!

2690 2018-08-17 17:46:34 I’ve never understood why eating vegetables is hard for people. I say they are super delicious—just eat them!
But if you’re not convinced, sautéing or roasting any vegetable with oil, salt, and pepper is a great way to enhance flavour and texture. #EatYourGreens!

2698 2018-08-17 17:45:50 I think your looking to the political overtures inside this Nation, but keep your eyes on the numerous foreign wars we perpetuate, and the number of soldiers that come back in caskets for the purpose of keeping the oil contracts in place.
2699 2018-08-17 17:45:46 Scott’s midyear campaign report shows at least $880,000 in contributions from oil, gas and energy executives and employees to his campaign and from the industry to a pro-Scott super PAC. The industry is generally aligned with Republican candidates.

2705 2018-08-17 17:45:03 To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. All the centuries we are ranked on the same level of oil production have used their opportunities to diversify during booms. But we never did. On the contrary we squandered our reserves and saved nothing.
2706 2018-08-17 17:44:56 Are they draining radiator fluid, or is it like getting an oil change? SO MANY QUESTIONS!
2707 2018-08-17 17:44:35 umm fool Rocket Scientist I would imagine Florida does consume some off shore oil and gas...

The 2 prices were 27,000 or 30,000... BRO HOW SO YOU THINK ITS 27,000 LOL he lost! Even I knew the price, and idc for cars
2711 2018-08-17 17:44:17 Sometimes I feel like the whites Mexican. I mean my brother who doesn't even go in the sun is darker than me. But  whenever someone guesses what I am they always say White and Asian.  Maybe I should do a 2 hour walk covered in suntan oil.

2716 2018-08-17 17:43:33 Never had anything to do with that.  If women cared so much about equality they'd be pushing to do the jobs they never do: construction, mining, transportation, oil & gas, electrical, plumbing, waste management.  They don't because these are tough, low-status jobs
2717 2018-08-17 17:43:20 waiting to get an oil change ..

2732 2018-08-17 17:41:09 @realDonaldTrump Turkey is not the number able to stand against the United States, it should teach the Turkish authorities. In the case of sanctions, we would not tolerate the exemption from the oil embargo, we will do it whenever we say it,

You’re so blessed to have been able to be in the presence of the ‘Manifestation of the Impossible’
The message is as pure and simple as the Oil itself.
I know it’s not the actual Bible Oil that cures.
2742 2018-08-17 17:40:15 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
2743 2018-08-17 17:40:13 Put a pinch of salt and a few tablespoons of oil in the badder, should help em crisp up & easier to slide off

2746 2018-08-17 17:39:48 If Blizzard wanted the new expansion to remind folks of Warcraft II then they should've made the big new resource we're all fighting for oil instead of magic crystals or whatever, and also make Ogres a playable race for the Horde
2747 2018-08-17 17:39:44 البنوتة بتاعة فيديو أون زا رن طلعت أعرفها وكانت معايا في المدرسة وأختها كانت دفعتي والعيلة حلوة والبنت بترسم oil painting ومتابعة شغلها من فترة وحلوة وبسمسم صراحة
2748 2018-08-17 17:39:42  Jet blue , boss white , gas seal but oil is the one The occasional solvent weld too just to check 
2749 2018-08-17 17:39:30 And sometimes, we had to change the cooking oil before cooking it, too. It was something, man.

2754 2018-08-17 17:38:40 2) I believe the Oil could be a powerful instrument that would 
tip absolute belief in Gods favor. 
A conduit so to speak. 
A nudge even.
Thank you SO MUCH for this show
You’re doing the most important work.
Blessings

2755 2018-08-17 17:38:15 Snake oil

Try again sis  I’m need you to stop picking up the eco styler and pick up some castor oil and big up the edges like you bugging me up right now

Maybe not this time for yours!
2758 2018-08-17 17:37:51 It’s interesting to think about the ways that oil and slavery are and aren’t analogous in these cases.
2759 2018-08-17 17:37:48 Omg did the oil like get like all hard and gross??? That happened to me lol I never bought those ones again

2764 2018-08-17 17:37:23 Gunna's voice is sooooo soothing to me. It's like an essential oil or some. Slime scented tho.

2770 2018-08-17 17:36:30 My mom just gave me a bracelet with essensial oil on it and it smells like lemon cake

Now i just want lemon cake
2771 2018-08-17 17:36:19 What is not a myth is that they and allmost all other civilized countries have accessable health care and education for all. Also the ones without big oil.
2772 2018-08-17 17:36:16 Most of the kids fighting the gulf war did not own oil companies.
2773 2018-08-17 17:36:14 Who needs an oil change?
2774 2018-08-17 17:36:05 Look across the exploration and you would see companies have found oil with 20% cos and Djeno has 25%, which is pretty good in my eyes.
2775 2018-08-17 17:35:56 Today grandson learnt to sign oil and filter  tomorrow  it's going to be spark plugs  yesterday was motorcycle  ! All the important stuff right ? 
2776 2018-08-17 17:35:42 ....in exchange for mid eastern oil. Loosening restrictions in certain national monuments would allow for further uranium mining to be sent to the power plants in the middle east...

Not saying its true...but it's in the realm of possibilities and something to watch out for
2777 2018-08-17 17:35:30 The Obama administration gave Musk a low interest loan to cut our dependence on middle eastern oil. 

Musk quietly sells Telsa to the Saudis. 

Via Twitter. 

He’s a gem.
2778 2018-08-17 17:35:23 So we should shut down all industry to combat this crisis. Oil and gas, steel manufacturers, coal (25 tons of coal are needed to smelt steel to make one wind turbine) all agriculture. plastics industry, pulp and paper mills etc etc. Who would you like to throw out of work first?
2779 2018-08-17 17:35:06 so my coworker and I were opening this morning and she tried putting CBD oil drops in my mouth and instead we spilled it all over my shirt ... lmao we’re a mess
2780 2018-08-17 17:35:04 Best business ever, no need of oil.
2781 2018-08-17 17:34:56 subag is elite, beautiful 
olive oil is the easier alternative innit
2782 2018-08-17 17:34:52 How much water are you drinking? Are you really stressed out right now? Have you tried oils? I read that oily skin is skin that's lacking moisture so adding a facial oil to your routine can help a lot!

Also what kind of moisturizer are you using?
2783 2018-08-17 17:34:49 You  will In sha Allah 
2784 2018-08-17 17:34:44 Has anyone had any experience using CBD oil for anxiety? If so DM me id love to hear about it
2785 2018-08-17 17:34:25 If the oil comes from an animal base then chips are out as well as the fish.
2786 2018-08-17 17:34:19 lavender essential oil. a couple drops in a spray bottle of water should do it
2787 2018-08-17 17:34:18 “I love matcha, but also it also kind of tastes like fish oil and I’m pretty sure I actually hate it” 
-The Joe Duffy Story.
2788 2018-08-17 17:34:17 Nah I know ppl have it with oil  back home it’s usually subag but I hate it 
2789 2018-08-17 17:34:16 I think it's the industries that need to move on tbf. Most are adding 'or equivalent'. I've been in oil & gas as a QHSE Manager for 8 years, and my employer has funded my NCRQ diploma as CPD - there's a better business case, and IOSH and IIRSM both recognise NCRQ now.
2790 2018-08-17 17:34:09 Nationalisation of a state asset causes such angst in alleged capitalist democracies it brings out the dictator in the leadership and a blatant hatred for the usurpers. look at how Iranian oil is threatened today by the same capitalist warlords
2791 2018-08-17 17:34:02 What was the name of the facial oil again that you use? Great ep, as usual, kish kish 
2792 2018-08-17 17:33:53 さすが
2793 2018-08-17 17:33:29 I do a retinol cream/serum at night and a sensitive skin light moisturizer in the morning.  Biore aqua rich watery sunscreen is really good for moisture and protection as well.

Retin A helps with oil, breakout, and wrinkles if you can get your hands on it.

2797 2018-08-17 17:33:10 Big Wind? Big Solar? Conservationists? Compared to the efforts made by oil companies and coal? Are you joking?
2798 2018-08-17 17:32:53 No thanks, I'll just have the regular old whore olive oil
2799 2018-08-17 17:32:52 Tame your headaches by rubbing peppermint oil like tiger balm to the temples.

2805 2018-08-17 17:31:10 So I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for –, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2806 2018-08-17 17:31:07 In Saudi Arabia there's free education and quality healthcare services paid by money made selling the country oil, in RSA miners are shot and killed for wanting R12 500 salary. While the "Ramaphosa's" of mines are walking away with billions
2807 2018-08-17 17:31:00 Yes. it is good things for rise up for oil price to drive up drilling globally.

@AnandakumarRama
2808 2018-08-17 17:30:39 Just watch it work. 
Sanctions against Iran is part of a bigger plan. 
Oil is a small part of that. 

The cooperation of everyone that wants peace is necessary. 

The end goal is World Peace. 
That sometimes requires relatively small inconveniences
2809 2018-08-17 17:30:34 Buying oil in Nigeria was not gonna make it cheaper for consumers in South Africa since petrol prices have gone high

2815 2018-08-17 17:30:01 New Mexico’s oil and gas industry continues to grow as we rank 3rd in national oil production and 9th in natural gas production.
2816 2018-08-17 17:29:38  coworker tells me, “I worked out yesterday and forgot to put the baby oil on, I still sweated like crazy! I think it’s still in my skin” dying over here!
2817 2018-08-17 17:29:36 There are a lot of commercials for health supplements that really go 0 to 100

"We noticed that most people today don't get enough Omega-3s in the diets"

"So we're introducing a new line of fish oil drinks that are 300% the daily omega-3 recommended value, absolutely CHOCK FULL"

2823 2018-08-17 17:28:53 This is an old article. McTraitor is a Soros puppet who just wants control and profits from Montenegro’s oil industry.

2825 2018-08-17 17:28:30 Anyone else think it’s odd that Colin has never really mentioned or given a value on the Oil that we have,Either it’s worth nothing so not worth mentioning or it’s worth a lot and for some reason they want to keep it under raps?@TraderPot you must know Tin Pot#ast

2828 2018-08-17 17:28:20 Is your argument that Regan alone was responsible for the unemployment rate?  Not global factors such as the war in Vietnam finally ending, not the "oil crisis" in 1973 & 1979 that rippled across the world, just Regan's policies?
2829 2018-08-17 17:28:19 I use coconut oil for everything, skin, hair... even found some lipgloss.
2830 2018-08-17 17:28:16 Both Hampden and Rowbotham were deep into other nonsense. Hampden ended up in prison for fraud and Row ended up claiming he had a snake oil to cure every disease, which he sold.
2831 2018-08-17 17:28:14 Who the hell puts oil on their laxoox tho?
2832 2018-08-17 17:28:12 Getting the 60,000 mile oil change and tire rotation. With Bailey, sorry @CindyBambini, then let the weekend begin.

2834 2018-08-17 17:27:49 A friend brought me CBD oil with THC from Colorado. Here in Illinois it’s not legal unless you have a medical card. It is like precious gold to me and it works beyond belief. Expensive, but amazing relief.
2835 2018-08-17 17:27:44 How'd you cook them...sautéed in olive oil?
2836 2018-08-17 17:27:37 - and I forgot the cooking oil. But we have hummingbirds.
2837 2018-08-17 17:27:36 Getting my baby an oil change and some TLC.  She's been through a lot. 
2838 2018-08-17 17:27:34 Just wait until we find another source for the oil we import from them.
2839 2018-08-17 17:27:17 Which cooking oil is “seed oil” so I can avoid it
2840 2018-08-17 17:27:01 Oil Spill? Seriously?
Since I live in Palm Beach close to Maralago, I wonder if the Secret Service and our EPA is preventing Melania to swim on the Atlantic ocean in front of Maralago...

You know why? They are worried about a "Silicon Spill" oozing out of Melanoma's Boobbbeeees

2842 2018-08-17 17:26:46 The Elite are terrified of Trump because he is going his own way and is NOT controlled by the chosen few. The Clinton Foundation, the Federal Reserve, big banks, big pharma, big oil, and big Media are beside themselves over losing control of the DNC AND the GOP!
2843 2018-08-17 17:26:45 It’s been a hour and a half and they still not done changing my oil wtf

2847 2018-08-17 17:26:28 Line 3 is the only pipeline that'll get built, as it is the only pipeline that carries oil to the US.
Called that one right after Trudeau made his pipeline approvals public.
The US considers Canadian oil as part of 'their' strategic energy reserves.
It ain't going to China.
2848 2018-08-17 17:26:28 Pecans and walnuts, MTC oil is also a good substitute
2849 2018-08-17 17:25:59 Looks like the cuticle oil they brush on

2851 2018-08-17 17:25:43 Laurie I agree it's a lot to take in emotionally. Of course we only really remember how it makes us feel. My own grandpa is that noble oil man, a WW2 vet who killed Nazis right and left and never got hurt, or ptsd, just was lied to. My family was used by the system just the same.
2852 2018-08-17 17:25:33 なんか力になれてるんですかねコレ

2863 2018-08-17 17:24:25 What was the difference on heavy oil exports?
2864 2018-08-17 17:24:23 My local coffee shop has peanut butter syrup with is peanut oil and pulp withs little butter and its insanely good.
2865 2018-08-17 17:24:18 Besides chili oil and garlic add veges like capsi, mushroom, beans, carrot, onions... Saute.... Stir fry in a non stick pan.
2866 2018-08-17 17:24:00 It would cost the same amount of energy from carbon sources like oil to convert everyone's car to a hybrid or electric, rather than just sticking with gas. Better to just not drive as much.

When Energy East was being discussed, @irvingoil (the only refinery in the Maritimes) said they wouldn’t refine Alberta oil coming through this pipe, they’d shop it out...

2874 2018-08-17 17:23:10 Joe, remember when oil companies were supposed to be taking over PV solar in the 70s and 80s? It did look suspicious for a bit. Arco, Exxon, etc.
2875 2018-08-17 17:23:05 The Impossible Burger is another fantastic vegan choice. Our fries are hand-cut from either whole russet Burbank or russet Ranger potato and cooked in soybean oil, trans-fat free! They are cut thin and seasoned with sea salt. Hope to have you with us soon!

2878 2018-08-17 17:22:56 To be truthful, Erdogan has to do SOMETHING with all the ISIS terrorists he surreptitiously allowed safe passage to (along with their oil, arms and materiel). 

He's been making this threat for years to get EU membership. Now he's just backed into a corner and lashing out.
2879 2018-08-17 17:22:56 His step daddy Lolo Soetoro ran ‘Death Squads’ as a reserve Indonesian Army Major before he became a VP for Standard Oil and an oil tycoon.  Perhaps it runs in the family …
2880 2018-08-17 17:22:49 Don't waste your money ladies on skin products that sound too good to be true. Instead you simply buy Vitamin E facial oil at any local DG and it works just as well if not better! For the rest of your body use Coconut oil or lotion and it helps dry skin immediately.
2881 2018-08-17 17:22:46 Have you tried just putting the oil on your wrists (pulse points)? I’ve also tried lavender and that helps with stress-induced headaches/ migraines for me.

2886 2018-08-17 17:22:00 I don’t understand how he can be called a snake oil salesman when he has delivered nearly 400,000 cars to date. A delayed rollout doesn’t make the product a fake.
2887 2018-08-17 17:21:57 They have oil. But don't worry, soon democratic West will help them with such drawback.
2888 2018-08-17 17:21:51 I remember every friend I’ve ever had who has had an avocado tree. Aka an oil well.
2889 2018-08-17 17:21:49 I understand the need/want to lecture people about addiction. Given all of the opiod overdoses, I understand. But for fuck sakes, for people who actually require pain relief, they get treated like garbage. I'm looking into like CBD Oil, something I don't need a doctor for!
2890 2018-08-17 17:21:23 The Shell Oil logo represents the golden shell of Aphrodite, the goddess who rose from the sea.
2891 2018-08-17 17:21:13 Stop selling snake oil, data errors that point to wilful mistakes cannot be excused, in this case ZEC must explain why they happened in particular fashion not randomly, why they benefited one candidate & punished the other.
2892 2018-08-17 17:21:06 I love my new oil diffuser my house smells so good
2893 2018-08-17 17:21:00 oil change, tire alignment, 4 new tires, new battery and a car wash in a 24 hour span! my car is so damn expensive #sorrydad
2894 2018-08-17 17:20:51 oh should i drawtoday
because i checked my oil painting and the layer is pretty dry to cover it with new colours
2895 2018-08-17 17:20:45 I couldn’t hear what she was saying from the screaming her hair was doing. That poor head needs a hot oil treatment- stat!
2896 2018-08-17 17:20:32 Yeah but look at all that Russian oil holding every little hair in place.
2897 2018-08-17 17:20:13 well i've had some korean rice cakes in the fridge for a while, i think they are still good (i think they stay good for ages if sealed) so I'm thinking make a quick anchovy broth and boil them in that, then either stir fry or broil them with some sesame oil and soy sauce...hmm
2898 2018-08-17 17:20:03 Put baby oil on at the beach today. Figured I’d spend my last day in the ER with third degree burns
2899 2018-08-17 17:19:58 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2900 2018-08-17 17:19:53 そんなぁ・・・
2901 2018-08-17 17:19:41 @ProfOsinbajo preyed on the lack of comprehension our people suffer from. If u have a beat up flat boot Benz and you overhaul it by changing the tires, shocks and oil it's still a beat up flat boot except it runs a bit faster.
2902 2018-08-17 17:19:40 As @StacyCHarmonie says in order to get wine, you have to crush grapes. In order to get oil, crush olives. Many are the afflictions of God's people. He scourges every son He loves.
2903 2018-08-17 17:19:40 When Giuliani & Peters(on Fox “News”), RonPaul, Buchanan, FGraham publicly endorsed Putin’s leadership in 2014, what happened the previous yr that gave them the nerve to go public? Looks like an unofficial United Oil Petrostate formed betwn country & Republican Party of oil.

2906 2018-08-17 17:19:26 Nope castor oil isn't comedogenic, it's frequently the main ingredient in oil cleansing formulas, and it was in my clay cleanser as well. For sensitive dry skin, have you given any thought to moisturizing with hemp seed oil?
2907 2018-08-17 17:19:24 Why does it take so long to get an oil change 
2908 2018-08-17 17:19:23 When I get home, my dad is taking my car to get an oil change, so of course I’m going to leave him with an empty tank so he also has to buy my gas. Milking parental support for as long as I can, y’all

2915 2018-08-17 17:18:36 My mom just learned the phrase “come through” and she uses it in every text. I asked her what was she up to and she sent, “COME THROUGH new tires and oil change!”

2918 2018-08-17 17:18:14 My thought for this weekend; 'Harry Potter makes me nostalgic about the future of magic and poetry and magical poetry about banana peels causing male oil rig workers to slip and grab female oil rig workers' body parts on their way down, cleaning up spills and freeing free verse.'
2919 2018-08-17 17:18:10 All the oil companies have helicopters for their use in offshore.They should be requested or instructed to spare them for rescue operations and employed wheever necessary.Hope CMO will do the needful#keralafloodrelief

2923 2018-08-17 17:17:40 you could change my oil during recess
2924 2018-08-17 17:17:39 Ameen
2925 2018-08-17 17:16:59 Saw it last night, sooo cheesy! But very funny 
2926 2018-08-17 17:16:57 That's only because they rely on oil. If there was an unlimited power source we could use to pay for this. Fusion energy technology is coming soon
2927 2018-08-17 17:16:52 Over next 24 mths, nothing will get paid unless oil goes to $ 2,800 bbl. or as a gambler would say red has to come up fifteen in a row and Maduro says it will as he puts his last dollar on red.
2928 2018-08-17 17:16:52 I love how I only asked them to change my oil, but they are still doing a full check up on my vehicle

2935 2018-08-17 17:16:20 What prayer??? The entire point is to remember His sacrifice. If you’re going to point out a “ritual” that mimics witchcraft that would be more anointing oil than communion...
2936 2018-08-17 17:16:19 Venezuela has a lot more oil than we do. What could possibly be wrong with it?
2937 2018-08-17 17:16:11 I am sure there is a lack of infrastructure to get the oil to the refinery, and than transport the petro to the masses.  The same with food and medicine.  There is no good vehicle to distribute the goods.  There needs stability for this to happen.  Love your work @marianaatencio
2938 2018-08-17 17:16:07 Agent Orange (fake tan, snake oil) argued with Vietnam vets over a quote from Apocalypse Now the movie #Omarosa got #OmarosaTapes

2955 2018-08-17 17:14:33 I knew that was coming.   Fucking "class character". 

It's a non argument. The Soviet union invaded Afganistan for it's copper reserves, and they didn't hold the Urals, the caucuses (full of oil) and the baltic states for no reason... 

plus they had blatant classes

2960 2018-08-17 17:13:50 I hate being so embarrassed saying to people ‘oh I can’t eat peanut oil, I’m allergic’ etc. Like I have actually cried in the past or got teary because I hate being an inconvenience and knowing that there are nuts in the environment scares me

2965 2018-08-17 17:13:07 @brownandbella Bella, would you say castor oil is comedogenic? Thinking of rinsing face with warm water, applying, then wiping off the oil at night. Have a hugely sensitive/sensitised, yet dry skin.
2966 2018-08-17 17:13:06 So they washed my car and performed the quickest oil change ever.... I take back SOME of my mood.

2969 2018-08-17 17:13:03 Argan oil works best for me. For some odd reason, coconut just doesn't sit well on my skin or on my hair, it's weird. I need to find a good keratin mask tho cuz all the ones I've tried make my hair feel crunchy  what brand did you use?
2970 2018-08-17 17:13:03 Because we care #OOTT , if you are a young engineer promoted and moved into oil and gas trading, the skills you had as a productive engineer don't make you an immediate energy commodity supertrader and hedger.  Seek guidance.  Just like you did in engineering.

2978 2018-08-17 17:12:24 ugh. this is why i dislike this whole barely educated essential oil users. yes some oils you can use topically. but a stomach ache drink peppermint tea, drink or eat ginger. not rub peppermint oil all over herself.

2995 2018-08-17 17:10:22 Massage your scalp regularly. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Eat well. Is it NISIM or NHB?  slows hair loss. or related. How must I uncover the true web page. Worth the time. Many benefits.

3022 2018-08-17 17:07:32 Hey @elonmusk just laser eats off the layer may be 0.5 - 1.5mm thickness rather soak them in vinegar [24Hrs] and clean them with soft brush - give them a oil soak/ Metal Plating it does retain longer. 

Over my reliable source tried it to be safe and admits to use less energy.
3023 2018-08-17 17:07:24 The relevant measure is not profit, but profit as a % of the investment required to establish the company. By that measure, the average oil company earns around a 5% return. Dominos Pizza and Apple are 4 to 10 times more profitable than are oil companies.

3028 2018-08-17 17:06:42 It's not a popular opinion among liberals, but I'm a supporter of oil pipelines. I think they'll do a lot to strengthen our economy, and I also think it's better for people to get their oil from us than from some war-torn region in the middle east.

3166 2018-08-17 16:51:48 Over the years I’ve tried skincare products from the expensive ones to cheap ones I have discovered that my face tak perlu guna banyak steps......only cleanser, toner, moisturiser, oil and mask sheets at most
3167 2018-08-17 16:51:45 @DanielLubetzky - Q: where do you get the Palm Kernel Oil from, in your KIND bars?
3168 2018-08-17 16:51:39 ..vote no they said to stop privatisation of our NHS, vote no they said to save the HMRC jobs, vote no they said to make the Scottish Parliament permanent, lead the UK not leave the UK they said, oil and gas running out they said, blah blah, all lies from entrenched privilege....

3170 2018-08-17 16:51:23 It's of course helped, but the emphasis has been on pursuing an efficient public sector funded by a progressive and efficient tax system. There are limits to domestic use of oil money, as it leads to higher inflation. Sweden doesn't have oil.

3177 2018-08-17 16:50:45 The ancient Tamizh grammarian Agattiyan (cognate with sage Agastya) says:

இலக்கியம் இன்றி இலக்கணம் இன்றே, 
எள்ளன்றாகில்
எண்ணெயும் இன்றே

Which translates:

No literature, no grammar
No sesame seed, no oil*

*sesame oil, of course!
3178 2018-08-17 16:50:37 Well we'll see how long my oil change takes....
3179 2018-08-17 16:50:21 $40 bucks to be in the same room as the worlds foremost coconut oil expert who also happens to manage a big league team is a steal IMO

3182 2018-08-17 16:50:02 Full disclosure ZH hates oil.
3183 2018-08-17 16:49:54 Exactly. One can't mix oil and water.
3184 2018-08-17 16:49:49 Big business produces automobiles that produces pollution.
Big business produces guns that kill children.
Big business produces coal, oil and gasoline that pollute the planet.
Big business produces food that promotes obesity.
Big business puts profits ahead of decent wages.

3187 2018-08-17 16:49:20 @POTUS  Wow! After 4 hrs look how low those retweet & like numbers are.  This is starting to be a trend. Looks like our base has had it's fill of snake oil. #AWAG
3188 2018-08-17 16:49:18 Why is it so easy for you to blame Green voters? Why would they support a candidate who exported fracking across the globe? Who was anti M4All? Who’s from a party who just decided to take oil money? Hundreds of thousands of Dems stayed home rather than vote for her.
3189 2018-08-17 16:49:16 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
3190 2018-08-17 16:49:12 Why not? How many soldiers do we have today? Oil was not a significant earner pre-1970. We had nearly twice as many troops to call upon in 1970 after a war for which we did not borrow a kobo - cost £300m
3191 2018-08-17 16:49:08 not lavender and chamomile oil?
3192 2018-08-17 16:48:47 To be fair I think there are always problems with oil but the alternative here is oil + bigotry and policies that punish all but an elite few so I will take the caring and compassionate policies of the NDP over any other party regardless of their position on pipelines.

3198 2018-08-17 16:48:00 Running our country, I would think. I do agree we should cut all ties with SA but it always comes down to oil.
3199 2018-08-17 16:47:56 I took my car in for an oil change and ended up with over $300 worth of repairs needing done. I got my first paycheck from my new job today and it included my regular pay with an additional $300 of expenses from me working in Nashville #silverlinings

3201 2018-08-17 16:47:42 CBD oil is derived from the hemp plant. It is a cannabinol technically it is not THC which is what makes people high when they use marijuana. It is a different part of the plant. It is very relaxing,  anti-inflammatory, and has pain relief properties.
3202 2018-08-17 16:47:38 Ty! It’s a cannabis oil extraction lab.

3206 2018-08-17 16:47:24 He is not a great public servant. He was instrumental in getting TRex as Secretary of State, which was a disaster. Gates, along with Condi Rice, was paid by oil companies to promote TRex for that job
3207 2018-08-17 16:47:19 I suspect that one factor in the greater consumption of oil than sugar is that people were already pretty well satiated with sugar. Eventually even Americans don't want things to be even sweeter.
3208 2018-08-17 16:46:57 True true.. my issue is I'm pretty sure whatever tech they do release they will say it runs off some very exotic material so it doesnt interfere with gas.. I'm wondering how oil people are feeling about to the stars academy..

3226 2018-08-17 16:44:13 That is pie-in-the-sky talk. But, people are pissed that this Congress has aligned themselves with their radical right-wing base, and not what's good for the country. They can't even say they are asleep at the wheel. They have gratefully become an oil slick.

3235 2018-08-17 16:43:18 True - but what golds under the unforgiven lands contain, may even make up the riches for humankind such as oil, gas, gold, ore, minerals, etc. The problems are the vast distances, the huge investments and so on. Yet our forefathers on their way to Klondike were no snowflakes!

3254 2018-08-17 16:41:08 Macadamia brand healing oil works pretty good for me. It’s a little on the expensive side but it’s a weightless oil and it doesn’t leave my hair feeling greasy even when I use too much lol

3267 2018-08-17 16:39:34 Those refineries are not equipped to handle more heavy oil and they have no intention to change. Piping bitumen 5000 kms to a place where no one wants it is not a wise or economical idea. 

Why isn't Nfld oil supplying eastern Canada?

3270 2018-08-17 16:39:13 “Most of the men who fought for the South had no slaves.”

Of course the men who actually fought in the civil war didn’t own slaves. Our soldiers today who fight for oil interests don’t actually own the oil fields either. 
3271 2018-08-17 16:39:08 Have to get my oil changed. Sitting in service center... usually have a couple snacks, waters available... today NOTHING. like what the hell? You hold me hostage for an hour and you can’t at least feed me with crummy snacks and caffeine?
3272 2018-08-17 16:39:04 Unfortunately I’m a dual US-Canadian citizen & a tax payer too so I have interest on what’s going w/ this badly run country. I’m an oilman & Canada  will pump some oil. I’m a Nevada resident too. U shd be ashame of itself as a navy man 4 not standing for d Amer. hero Brennan
3273 2018-08-17 16:39:02 How tf you gonna leave a can of oil on top of the grill???
3274 2018-08-17 16:38:42  look at the reviews, heat cooks food the oil dehydrates it, oil is often a by product so they use air to dehydrate instead
3275 2018-08-17 16:38:41 There's no drilling ban. There's barely any oil. It's spelled Bosphorous. Did you go to school?

3277 2018-08-17 16:38:26 I think people don't usually see benefits if they don't really *need* it, kinda like taking vitamin B12 if you're already energetic. A lot of people accidentally take hemp seed oil as well...
3278 2018-08-17 16:38:12 That's a picture of a tanker on fire. Last I checked we ship our oil to the us via pipeline. The lies coming out of that cockroach are beyond the pale.

3281 2018-08-17 16:38:00 For Wright Enterprises LLC, farming has always been a family affair. In addition to growing their commodity crops, they also produce a value added product: sunflower oil! 
Adding this to their farm keeps their whole family involved- even the next generation!

3286 2018-08-17 16:37:09 The larger issue is shamrock not seeming that strategic outside of financially. Has taken place in many places where the recruiting ROI was almost zero: Lucas oil, NYC, Boston.
3287 2018-08-17 16:37:06 !! I use tea tree oil on active breakouts (kills them so fast!!) and argan oil when they are dry. Using witch hazel as a toner has been the best thing for prevention as well!! It really helps with old scarring too. Good luck bby  lmk how it goes!!

3293 2018-08-17 16:36:23 It’s really hard for me to believe you when you won’t even take the Democratic Party on. How are you going to fight Big Oil?

3300 2018-08-17 16:35:50 Pressing for oil? I see what you did there... 

Good to see a scientific response to this.
3301 2018-08-17 16:35:37 If you use extra virgin olive oil as lube does the sex count?
3302 2018-08-17 16:35:37 If they were raw yes they‘d be healthy, or boiled in water, like cut potatoes in fries shape and boil them in just water. I mean they probably taste bad, but they‘d be healthy. Only reason fries arent is because theyre fried in a sea of oil.
3303 2018-08-17 16:35:31 yes well what I'm saying is that this technology can help us so we can keep using coal and oil for like 20 years without completely destroying the planet. We still need to invest in renewables as fast as possible
3304 2018-08-17 16:35:31 No, @BenJealous is making the link by using pre-k as a carrot to get people to support legalization.  It would be like Exxon asking people to support more drilling if they promise to pay for oil booms.

3309 2018-08-17 16:34:59 As far as anti- oil, you're going to have to work hard to prove that to me.
3310 2018-08-17 16:34:57 Lots of proj under FERC jurisdiction: pipe/LNG/oil exp terminals, etc. Approvals are shorter, feds don’t change rules mid review & undermine FERC, social license issues not relevant unless codified by law, etc. Ergo, capital leaves  & flows to the . We’re not competitive.
3311 2018-08-17 16:34:40 Yaaay!! 

Spell for CBD Deals:
 

use code Tweet15 for 15% off our cbd oil

3312 2018-08-17 16:34:38 Make sure you wash the dish immediately after you cook them. Stir them like every 30 seconds while cooking so it doesn't stick to the sides and coat the dish with olive oil before cooking. All that helps but still a pain in the rear! Lol
3313 2018-08-17 16:34:33 thats why it burned, all that oil and gas under it, just here to help. ya-noe
3314 2018-08-17 16:34:29 ฮืออออออออตอนจบเป็นเพลงสั่นแล้วคิดถึง love sick เลยอ่ะ #lovebychanceseries
3315 2018-08-17 16:34:21 Alasannya karena kata orang Freeman Mask varian Cucumber itu bagus untuk tipe kulitku yang kombinasi, jadi pengen nyoba. Apalagi aku masanya pengen ngerawat diri, hehe. Dan aku sangat sangat sangat membutuhkan garnier micellar water oil karena punya aku yang biru gak cocok :(
3316 2018-08-17 16:34:19 I've been in denial, but I definitely have a waddle going on lol. My body hurts. Feels like a wheel that needs oil. So much stiffness
3317 2018-08-17 16:34:12 아아 졸린데.... 못자겠다....
3318 2018-08-17 16:34:07 Been at Walmart for 3 damn hours waiting for my oil change
3319 2018-08-17 16:34:06 ever since I started removing my eye makeup with coconut oil I’ve seen a significant growth in my lashes so I guess the hype is true
3320 2018-08-17 16:34:03 He does indeed love his fish oil!!
3321 2018-08-17 16:34:03 Yes it’s a comfort smell to me. I have it in my oil burners and even incense
3322 2018-08-17 16:33:53 DAMN KIDS AND YOUR ROCK N' ROLL MUSIC!
3323 2018-08-17 16:33:37 Pake bio oil coba, agak mahal sih emang tapi work it
3324 2018-08-17 16:33:34 If it does dry your hair out just use coconut oil (just a little) or, for overall body improvements, eat a table spoon a day.
3325 2018-08-17 16:33:09 The Hill- pfft. Establishment whores. Completely misrepresent (omit) the US/Saudi intentional flooding of the oil market suppressing Venezuela’s oil based economy as the vulture capitalist came in & gouged ppl 4 food setting stage for #USImperialism & #RegimeChange 4 #Oligarchs.
3326 2018-08-17 16:33:07 I’m sure you more knowledgable than me on the subject, but hasn’t the oil wealth allowed Norway to pursue social policies without the high tax burden the UK would incur for the same policies?
3327 2018-08-17 16:33:00 Nissan said if I give them a perfect survey review I can get a free oil change OR tire rotation. Lol nah I would rather run your good reviews into the ground on google.
3328 2018-08-17 16:32:52 おー！気に入ってくれたら嬉しいですぞ！ww
3329 2018-08-17 16:32:42 yes it's neither a perfect nor a long term solution, but if we keep using coal and oil to produce power, this may help us to survive a bit longer
3330 2018-08-17 16:32:39 We need essentials such as sanitary napkin, bread, biscuits, oil, soap, brush, mat, towel at Haripad. Please contact Rajeev Peethambaran

3332 2018-08-17 16:32:26 You’re not using social media for free, your paying them in data. They’re getting your data for free.  “Data is the new oil”.
3333 2018-08-17 16:32:12 @SandyHingston Mayo makers also helped to "kill" mayo. Hellman's USED to taste SO GOOD! They used to use egg yolks, not whole eggs. The oil they now use also just does not taste as good. The pursuit of more profits sacrificed the taste.
3334 2018-08-17 16:31:56 Join Ozz and Get on out to Loeder Oil BP in Deerfield for Customer Appreciation Day with tons of deals on Pepsi and prizes!!! We are here til 1p
3335 2018-08-17 16:31:52 Still waiting for the detailed, all consuming coverage of @Ocasio2018 attack on the first amendment by barring press from her upcoming town hall, I expect tater himself, @brianstelter, to lead this coverage.
3336 2018-08-17 16:31:39 LOL is that me dodging bullets? 
Fanks!!! 
Anythings got to taste better than clove oil surely? Even your cooking!!!
3337 2018-08-17 16:31:38 Bc I keep touching them lol and you’re not supposed to touch your face cuz oil

3341 2018-08-17 16:31:22 A technical team from @REMA_Rwanda and other stakeholders including @CIMERWAPPC & @reg_rwanda have been trained on the safe drainage,decontamination and elimination of #PCBs contaminated oil. #GreenRwanda

3343 2018-08-18 23:59:58 #Foodie twitter, help?

I like vinegar & oil (Italian) salad dressing; Spouse doesn’t. I’m lazy. My recipe is good oil, white wine vinegar, @PenzeysSpices Sandwich Sprinkle. In bottle, shake. 

Better when it steeps. But if I put in fridge, it’s solid.

Is this counter stable?
3344 2018-08-18 23:59:57 The government made the economy reliant on oil. Saudi Arabia didn't crash completely like Venezuela did. Maduro decided to print money to pay for the gov spending, which created inflation, and then controlled prices to stop inflation, which created scarcity.
3345 2018-08-18 23:59:50 Also I haven’t been pro military since the 8th grade LMAO
there’s no point for the expected trauma these people go through if we weren’t so oil driven & IMPERIALISTIC LMAO 
Y do you think we created the space force? A new frontier to conquer sounds too close to manifest destiny

3347 2018-08-18 23:59:33 I’m extremely worried that Zinke is living on a different planet; US & Earth need an actual Interior Secretary that resides, studies, understands “here & now”, and is concerned for other than Big Oil, Big Business, Big Capital #Basta
3348 2018-08-18 23:59:32 You got this @Zeb_Wise39 !
3349 2018-08-18 23:59:19 had buffalo wings w dumpling soup cos my dad ate dumplings, and now i want sesame garlic butter wings bc of the sesame oil in the soup
3350 2018-08-18 23:59:16 (Alternately, putting some *cat-safe* essential oil on the back of both their necks)
3351 2018-08-18 23:58:54 Today at the large grocery store they offered free flu shots. Now keep in mind that the grocery store sells cough syrups. All kinds of remedies including tissues and snake oil to sick people. They say ins cover many of the shots. Is it a con to charge you when you don't qualify?
3352 2018-08-18 23:58:48 My dog fw the cbd oil
3353 2018-08-18 23:58:47 Let me tell you, CBD oil is the shit for anxiety.

3359 2018-08-18 23:58:21 @SearsAuto Help!!! I had an oil change a few weeks ago and it’s been slowly leaking & I just found out they stripped it when they tried to tighten... my car is broken!!!!!
3360 2018-08-18 23:58:18 That looks to be orrechietti. “Little ears”. When I was in Puglia I ate them with olive oil and dandelion greens. Delicious!
3361 2018-08-18 23:58:16 My dealership really tried to charge me $70 for an oil change earlier today. I just thought about that fuck shit and laughed.

3385 2018-08-18 23:57:33 Decided real quick motor didn't really need oil
3386 2018-08-18 23:57:31 @ImranKhanPTI Oil: When importing from Iran, there would be no cost of shipping, insurance, storage and port handling, as all can come through land using pipes.
3387 2018-08-18 23:57:11 I had one digging around a well years ago.   Went to the well to check the oil one night.  Pouring oil into the motor.   Motor blaring.  Pickup lights shining my way.   Looked down and he was in the top of his hole growling and showing teeth.
3388 2018-08-18 23:56:55 Actually it was a tank not a well.  An oil tank where he worked.
3389 2018-08-18 23:56:39 “if OIL & WATER doesn't mix , surely being MESSY & ANOINTED won't either” per @x_monet  this is solid
3390 2018-08-18 23:56:29 What did the Victorians use oil for ?
3391 2018-08-18 23:56:27 I'm surprised that not many people know about fried macaroni & cheese.
No, not breaded and deep-fried.
Fried like throw it in the frypan with a little butter/margarine/oil and fry it til the cheese gets nice & toasty-crunchy.
Maybe my Dad invented it?
3392 2018-08-18 23:56:14 Politicians who are taking money from the coal and oil companies are some of those shameless liers! Where the all mighty dollar wins over Patriotism.
3393 2018-08-18 23:56:02 @ImranKhanPTI Pakistan imports from USA ~ $2 bn and exports ~ $3 bn. ... Unfortunately, due to fear of American sanctions, Pakistan imports oil and gas from Arab world instead of Iran, costing Pakistan billions of dollar extra yearly. Pakistan cannot afford this. for instance:
3394 2018-08-18 23:55:55 @PervGriffin He challenged me and I love that ! He was like Wow! I said I don't have one medicine in my system not cbd oil even. Nothing!
3395 2018-08-18 23:55:42 The Energy East Pipeline was meant for Irving Oil to become rich by exporting Albertan refined oil to the US! It was never meant for domestic purposes! #cdnpoli
3396 2018-08-18 23:55:36 Tea tree oil?
3397 2018-08-18 23:55:17 glow or oil
3398 2018-08-18 23:54:23 Never over used. It's like saying "google it," the standard. Like standard oil back in the mid early 1900's.
3399 2018-08-18 23:54:17 No excuses for toxicity, its proof somethings wrong and not vibin: you can’t force water to mix with oil
3400 2018-08-18 23:54:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i lost acnl again dude that was not epic..
3401 2018-08-18 23:53:49 What my monday is going to look like: work 10 hours, get off work & immediately go get an oil change at a car dealership that will take forever. Go home & sleep for 3 hours then get up & drive an hour & a half to see @BrandonReilly. Drive an hour & half back home, sleep forever.
3402 2018-08-18 23:53:43 Honestly it seems 2 work BUT it does effect a certain enzyme in your body that breaks down other medicine. So if you’re on any type of medication that you don’t want to be potentially effected, I would suggest maybe the vape instead of the pill/oil? Not sure if that would be diff
3403 2018-08-18 23:53:42 Because drinking motor oil is a bad idea

3407 2018-08-18 23:52:29 What percentage of the refined oil from the Energy East Pipeline was earmarked for domestic use versus exportation to the US? #cdnpoli
3408 2018-08-18 23:52:19 You what? We extracted oil of the east coast of Scotland in Victorian times. BP began modern extraction in the 60s.
3409 2018-08-18 23:52:15 Boost body lotion with baby oil If you're craving shiny legs that aren't greasy, blend a drop of baby oil into your normal body lotion.

3413 2018-08-18 23:51:46 明日からビーチバレー？
3414 2018-08-18 23:51:41 So pretty stuck in graveyard Keeper, the donkey wont move as he wants oil which I don't have or can't make. So I tried fishing and on the xbox its too hard, I cannot keep the fish in the bar, PC alpha videos look easy. So given up as I eat energy. @tinyBuild @LazyBearGames
3415 2018-08-18 23:51:07 I’m stuck on an oil rig for another week and I’ve already been here 10 days so please share -

3417 2018-08-18 23:51:05 Happy someone is willing to admit that conservatism today amounts to violent conspiracy theories used to sell snake oil. Good on you.
3418 2018-08-18 23:50:55 Breaking: 10 minutes ago, Curiosity detects presence of oil on the red planet. 5 minutes ago, U.S. declares war on Mars.
3419 2018-08-18 23:50:43 You are correct -- but some of Trump damage will take years to fix.  When a oil rig is placed in what used to be a National Park or the Supremes end abortion the damage is far reaching.  The sooner he is impeached the better-- VOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3420 2018-08-18 23:50:40 Sad state of affairs in some parts of Central and South America, so easy to buy off officials, oil companies get away with all sorts of bribes
3421 2018-08-18 23:50:17 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
3422 2018-08-18 23:49:57 I love using coconut oil as moisturizer
3423 2018-08-18 23:49:34 Remember when the Supreme Court installed two oil executives as President & VP?

3425 2018-08-18 23:49:21 The Rockefeller family empire began in 1870 when John D. Rockefeller founded the Standard Oil Company.
3426 2018-08-18 23:49:19 Shutting in production doesn't affect supply in these circumstances: the constraint is the availability of oil to load the vessels upon demand #OOTT
3427 2018-08-18 23:49:14 Just to be clear, Jason Kenney is now claiming that provincial policy in Alberta and the Trudeau liberals scared oil investment off of the planet? Where did it go, Jason? #ABLeg
3428 2018-08-18 23:48:25 Were the beans drained? I know big tomatoes will add liquid but not sure how you got stew-ish. We did succotash today with corn, baby spinach, garlic, balsamic, a bit of coconut oil, salt, and cherry tomatoes added very late and it was solid.
3429 2018-08-18 23:47:51 No worries. As someone else stated, most frozen french fries are indeed blanched before packaging. CLEAN, FILTERED fryer oil is the key, along with oil temperature.....350°. Another problem in restaurants is using the same fryer for fish, chicken, egg rolls and fries. A big no no

3431 2018-08-18 23:47:38 I agree!! What this man did to his babies and his wife, is the vilest of vile!! And to desecrate the bodies of his babies, by putting them in oil, is sick!! Still say, he should be strung up live and just leave him until he rots, slowly!!
3432 2018-08-18 23:47:35 I need some oil for my vaporizer, I got cash in hand.
3433 2018-08-18 23:47:15 Wonder if cinnamon bark oil has the same effect ?
3434 2018-08-18 23:46:42 It was hillary that said we were deplorable.   And Trump allowed the drilling of certain areas to get the US to be energy independent.  Many friends work in the oil industry and in manufacturing.  Good for the US citizen. #MAGA
3435 2018-08-18 23:46:40 Dipped my hair in fucking motor oil ! 
3436 2018-08-18 23:46:38 I replied elsewhere to this. Yes, CBD oil has been a near miracle for me.
3437 2018-08-18 23:46:33 @nailogical as a college senior studying bio. I couldn't help but cringe in your new video. Abusing your microscope by using it in the highest setting with out oil
3438 2018-08-18 23:45:57 When they suggest you replace the air filter during the oil change, say yes once in a while.

3440 2018-08-18 23:45:36 I also use a tiny bit (it’s expensive) of the oil on my face and neck with my evening skin care. It’s resolved my mild facial eczema/atopic dermatitis.
3441 2018-08-18 23:45:34 Parents are fools to pay $30,000+ a year to have their kids indoctrinated by these radicals. Big College needs to be questioned as much as Big Oil and Big Pharma. It’s ruining minds and people’s savings.

3443 2018-08-18 23:44:56 Perish that thought! Oil is going to be here for all times. It’s been discovered in huge commercial quantities on the Benue trough - Oil n Gas.  Nigs problem is mgt. if other avenues are discovered and utilized but the IGR is mismanaged, Nig will remain where it is now.

3447 2018-08-18 23:44:13 Researching CBD oil bc I’m considering selling it and Chad looks over at me and says “why don’t you just sell drugs?” 
3448 2018-08-18 23:44:11 Yes but you see, we hadn't discovered North sea oil then. I think this piece has been written recently too as an argument for remaining. It's a pity all these people can't remember the time themselves.
3449 2018-08-18 23:44:09 Cook the beetroots/beets (I steam in shallow water until tender, then let cool, and slip the skins off gently with my fingers).
Dice them.
Dressing: olive oil, lemon, cider vinegar, Dijon, herbes de Provence, a little salt and pepper. 
Involve the beets and sour cream.
3450 2018-08-18 23:43:52 sounds familiar.  still at it. #GreaterSunriseOil negot. Spying on #EastTimorGovernment Arresting own agents/whistle blowers & still trying 2 take oil processing #Manufacturing & employment away from #EastTimor supposedly supporting independence. #Gusmao #Pacific #Indo
3451 2018-08-18 23:43:25 Still, a $40-$50 1g oil cartridge can last a month of more while a $15 gram of weed is gone in 2 days max. Me and my dad just hit his oil pen he bought in December lmao.
3452 2018-08-18 23:43:14 I have Rx CBD oil. The kind with a small amount of THC. Yes, it helps with neuro pain and reduces spasm. I greatly improved within days of starting and wouldn’t want to live without it.
3453 2018-08-18 23:43:07 “who needs an oil diffuser when you can just juul” 

oh okay
3454 2018-08-18 23:43:02 And where are the primary sources? I guess Putin is making Trump send military equipment to Ukraine, hurt Russia’s oil industry by sending liquid natural gas to EU, put a  missile system in Poland and add on to the sanctions against Russia... yep! Trump is Putin’s puppet alright.
3455 2018-08-18 23:42:50 I'm pretty sure EC3's PED's are laced with tanning oil! 
3456 2018-08-18 23:42:38 Oil her up, massage her then fuck the fuck outta her

3461 2018-08-18 23:41:38 كل سنة وانت طيب
3462 2018-08-18 23:41:36 I work in Apapa, the hardship experienced by commuters and workers alike going to & fro work is simply unbearable. Talk less of the health hazard & risk To life experienced day in day out.. to think that next to oil, maritime revenue is next. What a shame
3463 2018-08-18 23:41:15 me and you both... apparently methylated spirit mixed with coconut oil helps

3465 2018-08-18 23:40:59 I have some packages of motor oil if you need it, its flammable
3466 2018-08-18 23:40:43 Try tea tree oil! My sister has a redness problem she’s had it for years and since she started using the oil about a week ago it’s made a huge difference !!
3467 2018-08-18 23:40:40 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー
3468 2018-08-18 23:40:37 Well if you’ve got a whole gram in the blunt, its a waste price-wise compared to what you’re getting from a 1g oil cartridge.

3472 2018-08-18 23:39:45 My sister has a lot of redness she’s always had it and she started using tea tree oil on her skin about a week ago and it’s made a huge difference in her redness if you guys wanna try it :) it helped her maybe it’ll help you :)
3473 2018-08-18 23:39:26 You can get homemade stuff tested. Lots of cannabis home cooks & oil manufacturers who make their product at home get their levels tested to then sell to dispensaries. But they wouldn’t be able to sell that high of a dose in an edible so they wouldn’t test it. Story seems odd.
3474 2018-08-18 23:39:13 At least you didn't spread a oil for cooking like myself 
3475 2018-08-18 23:38:58 Tomou, vaca !??!?!?

3488 2018-08-18 23:37:10 Coconut oil helps with soothing after or medicated powder. Most hair removers don’t need to stay on very long anyhow...
3489 2018-08-18 23:37:10 Snake oil!!
3490 2018-08-18 23:36:58 Oil paint is awful. I just want to paint over all my bad decisions but now I gotta fume about it for 12 hours.
3491 2018-08-18 23:36:46 EIA data includes all production in “tight oil” counties & is therefore over-stated where conventional production is significant. Data in my charts is calibrated based on Drilling Info queries that eliminate prod that is other than tight oil.

3496 2018-08-18 23:35:45 Don't forget to sue the makers of Baby Oil. Either there's no babies in there and it's false advertising, or there's babies in it and...ewwww.
3497 2018-08-18 23:35:43 Brussle sprouts cut in half, tossed in olive oil and sprinkled with crushed hazenuts, and roasted, is absolutely delicious
3498 2018-08-18 23:35:41 I stopped using lotion a few years ago. Now I only use shea butter and coconut oil.. it’s been amazing.
3499 2018-08-18 23:35:25 Denmark ranked number one for countries whose citizens are happy. Also, Denmark in one of the world nations whose energy production is 100% from sustainables and clean sources: wind and solar, some geothermal. No fossil fuels.  Oil and gas moguls must be unhappy with Denmark.
3500 2018-08-18 23:35:22 My day consisted of getting burned 5 times, having oil splashed all over me and in my mouth, sweating 3 gallons, and falling on my ass
3501 2018-08-18 23:35:16 LC: "15 is smoking. Can't tell if he is putting oil down or not."
3502 2018-08-18 23:35:10 I changed my own oil today and I’m so proud of myself
3503 2018-08-18 23:35:01 There’s a reason why oil nations let these electric car boobs carry on.
3504 2018-08-18 23:34:59 Generally olive oil if the breads still warm. 

Cream cheese and/or bread for room temp is legit tho.
3505 2018-08-18 23:34:46 I know right like vegan or not it's just so gross ?? I bet he smells like frying oil all the time
3506 2018-08-18 23:34:46 As long as I have water, oil and hair butter/cream OR any 1/3 ingredients incl. water - my afro shall never fail me. LOC method is my hair'slife, that's the routine I found suitable for my hair.
3507 2018-08-18 23:34:41 I very much enjoy dipping bread in oil and balsamic vinegar. I also enjoy wearing quite expensive shirts. The two things do not combine well.
3508 2018-08-18 23:34:34 You know it! I imagine your rocket arm has only gotten stronger! My hands are like a well oiled catchers mitt because I use mitt oil!
3509 2018-08-18 23:34:33 I need someone to bring me vegetable oil pls
3510 2018-08-18 23:34:27 Me either. I think of Texas toast as really thick white bread that’s crisped w butter or olive oil and garlic
3511 2018-08-18 23:33:56 Everytime I put too much coconut oil in my hair and it gets in my eyes I feel bad for every person I've busted on.
3512 2018-08-18 23:33:51 @ OILY SKIN, oil is not a scary thing if you choose the right one! It penetrates the skin deeply and dissolves dirt and other gunk inside the pores which are otherwise hard to remove.
You need to look for oils high in linoleic acid:
3513 2018-08-18 23:33:43 New Mexico political humor: Candidate for Governor: “I favor fracking for New Mexico shale oil, so we won’t have to buy foreign oil — — like from Texas!”
3514 2018-08-18 23:33:39 I’m glad my mom came and got my car to get my oil change. I handed her my keys and $20 and said “make it enough” 
3515 2018-08-18 23:33:09 Texas smells like oil
3516 2018-08-18 23:33:09 Cool, so we'll just take our whisky, oil, water, farming, beer, energy, technology, computer games, meat, food, gin, fish, tourism, crafts, fabrication, fruit, clothing, TV, international book/arts/comedy festivals and stop being such a burden to you. 
3517 2018-08-18 23:32:39 Olive oil! It does me so well and it smells so good
3518 2018-08-18 23:32:34 I’ve tried a cbd oil but I know nothing really about it and I don’t think it was the right kind cause it didn’t do anything for the pain so I guess you have to know which ones are legit and I do not know what’s good and what isn’t
3519 2018-08-18 23:32:23 We don't need oil from the Middle East anymore. Besides, Syria isn't an oil-rich nation. Saudi Arabia is a more appropriate source of the development $ b/c Iran is firing missles at Saudi Arabia from Syria. Saudi Arabia can afford it; & it helps them to fight Iran's influence.
3520 2018-08-18 23:31:37 The "OIL CHANGE BRAKES TIRES WHOPPER"
3521 2018-08-18 23:31:16 A chunk of money from the BP oil spill lawsuit helped pay for last years Medicaid short fall. I guess the state will be hoping for another lawsuit to get them out of this instead of making better decisions with the tax payers money and quit voting in criminals
3522 2018-08-18 23:31:09 .@chevrolet I’ve been driving one of your cars for less than five years and it’s overheated on me at least five times, the head gasket blew off and it’s had several oil leaks. Make better cars.
3523 2018-08-18 23:31:06 The ultimate snake oil salesmen peddled his worthless crap on another group of suckers. Remember, Hitler duped a vast number of people during his time...

3525 2018-08-18 23:30:51 I keep hearing good things about jojoba oil. I think I'll be giving it a shot to see if I get the same results! Thank you!
3526 2018-08-18 23:30:49 it’s called investment in Kushner companies.

3528 2018-08-18 23:30:22 Todays number is 85.

85% of Westminster seats in one country & 85% post brexit powers, >85% of North sea oil income, >85% of Scottish industry including mines, steel and shipyards closed , >85% of council stock bulldozed or sold with RTB 

Not one of THESE was done by the EU.
3529 2018-08-18 23:30:20 It's sad how many dems ar trying to take you down along with big oil and all the other backwardian clans .. I'm building an all electric  boat with the hull of a 28ft catamaran I traded up to acquire but I'm not giving up just like I know u never will..
3530 2018-08-18 23:30:06 We fail to see that he is working against a stacked deck , the car industry has been saved over & over cause we THIRST for oil . Like most entrepreneurs he can’t fathom not succeeding after working sooo hard at something. . 120 hours a week , been there done that!

3535 2018-08-18 23:29:03 Coconut oil is good for everything!
3536 2018-08-18 23:28:50 Is that supposed to be a real rig or some apocalypse rendition of a oil rig? Keep spreading propaganda. Drill baby drill! 
3537 2018-08-18 23:28:00 Oh brilliant! You can go wrong with the tomato+basil+mozzarella+oil combo, in any form 
3538 2018-08-18 23:27:56 Totally agree. Virunga has a hard enough time with poachers, Ebola and kidnappers without having a hugh amount of land taken for drilling. The oil companies want the park reduced to nothing.
3539 2018-08-18 23:27:34 I sometimes put some organic EVOO and then sprinkle pepper and I am happy. Just oil up that green center hahaha.. This thread sounds kinda... um... What's the word.

3541 2018-08-18 23:27:30 People are starring at me waiting for my car to get an oil change at my dealership because I’m watching anime on my laptop...
3542 2018-08-18 23:27:23 Maddow quit the "issues we care about stuff" in  2015. I remember her reports on "oil train" in the US and the actual wars. with Richard whatshisname... it's what made me decide to watch #MSNBC for #Election2016.. but then #BernieBlackout. I was LIVID,  DISGUSTED. #DemocracyDead
3543 2018-08-18 23:27:03 Posh 2CV girl was my favourite. ‘Daddy forgot to put oil in it so the engine got all skrunkled up, which was a bit of a problem’
3544 2018-08-18 23:27:03 Blood money? Oil money? 
Foreign High Crime Of Bribery and Corruption? Not surprised.
3545 2018-08-18 23:26:51 @lushcosmetics what shampoo bar do you recommend for long, greasy, usually tangly hair? Been looking at Jason and the argan oil & jumping juniper!
3546 2018-08-18 23:26:31 Oil change, pads, rotors, bleed brakes.
3547 2018-08-18 23:26:31 UK Parliament is just a PR machine to promote policies that benefit the corporate elite. 

- Bomb Syria (for oil pipelines)
- Iraq has WMDs (regime change)
- Weapons to Saudi (to control oil)
- Anti Russia (geopolitical advantage)
- Iran sanctions (for BP expansion)
3548 2018-08-18 23:26:26 He was also involved in Irani Oil Smuggling.
3549 2018-08-18 23:26:23 はいーー気をつける！
3550 2018-08-18 23:26:22 I live in ND and it truly isn't fake news.  Farmer's and rancher's land is not producing..soil is not as good since oil drilling began years ago.
3551 2018-08-18 23:26:14 Soon as I got out the store my coconut oil melted.
3552 2018-08-18 23:26:11 We need to go green! Sure the transition will be a bit crazy, but oil isn't getting cheaper.. it's a good, long term investment for Ontario. Good for us, good for the planet..  win win.
3553 2018-08-18 23:26:05 I vote in a legal marijuana state.  Alcohol continues to be the most dangerous legal "drug." Also, mari helps a friend with chronic pain to function to a degree of normalcy. Mari oil helps the arthritis in my fingers exponentially.  Why not legalize it?  It's a good thing.
3554 2018-08-18 23:26:02 Yep. Your buying their gas and oil. Who would have the strength to stop them. Germany. No...not any more.
3555 2018-08-18 23:25:31 Those petrol shortages were caused by a farmer starting a blockade of Stanlow oil refinery in Cheshire, tanker drivers wouldn’t cross his picket line and the protest which was about fuel prices escalated across the country. The plot btw was hatched in a local pub over a pint.
3556 2018-08-18 23:25:20 I like Midnight Oil.  Thanks Ashley!
3557 2018-08-18 23:24:32 He stuffed the strangled bodies of his baby girls into oil barrels at his work site. Then went on tv, tearfully pleading for their safe return. Evil is real and it walks among us. If it has a white hide it can get away with anything.
3558 2018-08-18 23:24:29 Obviously. We have flowing wells and rivers. 4 major pipelines cross the river. Oldest one is 50 years old. Oil wells near the flowing wells. Been fraced. Again, never had a problem with either wells or pipelines in over 50 years.
3559 2018-08-18 23:24:26 YALL  i just used @palmersworks coconut oil  hair care line for the 1st time 

My FAVORITE line so far. It’s SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO moisturizing & smells sooo good 
3560 2018-08-18 23:24:16 Speak for yourself. I support our president and we should not be paying wealthy oil nations, while importing their oil.
3561 2018-08-18 23:24:07 In 1910, Gattefosse burned a hand very badly and later claimed he treated it effectively with Lavender Oil.
3562 2018-08-18 23:23:35 Oil change. Get’s haircut. Washes the HELL out his car. Gets home. Hears thunder. Awesome!  
3563 2018-08-18 23:23:33 It’s great. Biscuit pro tip: Treat it like butter. Coconut oil is technically solid at room temperature. However, if you are in a warm climate, you’ll need to cool it briefly in the fridge. I measure out then chill enough to dollop onto parchment paper & chill completely solid.
3564 2018-08-18 23:23:30 Why is that perfect? Since you’re so obsessed with what other people do for work why don’t you enlighten us as to your occupation! I’m sure it’s got to be something incredible like porn star or multi billionaire oil executive right?
3565 2018-08-18 23:23:20 Buddy of mine from work's husband worked in a beard salon & sold beard products. He was always trying to sell me on some oil or another, 'cause that was his thing, & my buddy would say, "Babe, does it look like he cares?" I just make sure it doesn't stink or sit funny after a nap
3566 2018-08-18 23:23:16 I’m 45 5 and a half years ago. I need Oil of Castrol
3567 2018-08-18 23:23:00 I love the oil monster!!!

3569 2018-08-18 23:22:52 a invisible oil spills
3570 2018-08-18 23:22:41 US has enough Oil domestic Get rid of Saudi oil it would cripple their economy they depend on us.
3571 2018-08-18 23:22:37 Funny story I got caught up the other night with oil and didn’t get arrested
3572 2018-08-18 23:21:43 I combine the two. Crypto is affected by the global economy and the USA is what drives that thru the oil trade. The largest market in the world
3573 2018-08-18 23:21:32 I did get my new fuck device in the mail but I'm still using my old one for now. Fuck devices leak oil. Its pretty irritating when I want things nice and clean as my whore house can get. So putting them together can be really messy

3580 2018-08-18 23:19:58 Someone wants to keep Canadian Oil in the Ground really really bad and that st all cost. Who’s behind that ??
3581 2018-08-18 23:19:55 Russia is creating allies in the Middle East to control oil trade. At the same time working with the USA.

3593 2018-08-18 23:18:25 Wow. I use olive oil for baking cakes and muffins and such. I never would’ve thought of coconut oil for making biscuits —which I haven’t done in a long time — but after seeing how nice yours looked I think I’m going to make some the next week or so
3594 2018-08-18 23:18:17 Yessss I just tried CBD oil the other day. Super helpful I need to get some!
3595 2018-08-18 23:18:01 Some folk getting misty-eyed about Kofi Annan now he's dead. But in life he presided over a UN crippled by corruption and human rights abuses. He was lucky to walk away from an inquiry with a reprimand for "mismanagement" after his son was caught trading oil for food. No hero.
3596 2018-08-18 23:17:52 What? No oil pulling? Your gums need seed oil too.

3599 2018-08-18 23:16:56 Russia is trying to take control of the oil trade. Notice how they sold missile trucks to Iran and now IRAN is no longer selling oil to the USA. New oil pipeline that runs from mid Russia thru to North Korea.
That's why Trump getting friends with Kim.

3604 2018-08-18 23:16:13 Yo I agree with the random lady. That stuff just makes my ish frizzy. Best thing I’ve found in order of effectiveness is: argan oil, avocado oil, and olive oil
3605 2018-08-18 23:15:57 Might try soaking them in the sink with dishwashing soap like Dawn or something. Breaks down the grease and oil enough so you can scrub the stains out.
3606 2018-08-18 23:15:51 I’ve always wondered that. Ppl who’re broke, yet the type of jobs that get you a shit ton of money without a degree are still the same. Sure, it’s crime scene cleaner, factory worker, oil rig deployment etc, It’s not pretty but it pays the bills. You can’t eat pride...

3637 2018-08-18 23:09:55 Likely a "terrorist" attack by IRAN. Causing them to go to war in that region and mobilise forces between the Russian and Middle East borders. Trying to keep Russia out of the Middle East oil supply.

3640 2018-08-18 23:09:26 ! @POTUS, it’s time for E15 all year!  15% Ethanol blends lower emissions, burn cooler & cut foreign oil import.  Lets stop talking about this and open the market to American Made!

3642 2018-08-18 23:08:28 Do you wear contacts? Ever cut some jalapeños then taken out your lenses without *scrubbing* the oil off your hands? Ouch.
3643 2018-08-18 23:08:23 I think they blanch them before they freeze them to take the air out and it's just using the oil to brown them.
3644 2018-08-18 23:08:19 CBD oil is really getting me through these cramps
3645 2018-08-18 23:08:15 Down trend till mid October with a dead cat bounce at 3k range is what I see happening. As the USD gets stronger with trumps tariffs and increased jobs and pay in the oil and manufacturing industry.
With some economic event occurring which fuels a collapse in USD strength.

3719 2018-08-18 22:58:07 bitch. coconut oil and shea butter hair products got my face BREAKINGOUT
3720 2018-08-18 22:57:15 I accidentally threw away my CBD oil...I am upset
3721 2018-08-18 22:57:11 Hair vitamins and Jamaican black castor oil (just a little bit for you)
3722 2018-08-18 22:56:53 I’m so tired of seeing Chris Watts’ face on social media. The children were found in a well with crude oil still in it.  I understand most human behaviors but this... I can’t. I just can’t.
3723 2018-08-18 22:56:52 おおお！みんなのうた、おはようくれよんだ！！！すきーーーー！！！
3724 2018-08-18 22:56:40 Эй, давай без нападок. Я просто пошутила
3725 2018-08-18 22:56:32 "Giving ketamine on an oil rig" 
3726 2018-08-18 22:56:29 there are many (none in this gov race). At this point we need to argue about the speed at which we dismantle old infrastructure, not with which we build new gas, oil, coal. oodles of jobs in the clean up, new infrastrucutre too
3727 2018-08-18 22:56:27 Yesss tea tree oil is a must!!!
3728 2018-08-18 22:56:02 #Trump would be a bunny boiler. Boiled in oil would be a suitable, if ancient, end for him.
3729 2018-08-18 22:55:52 another example would be more efficient cars. like we have more efficient cars but there are a growing number of cars on the road and not as many public transportation options. personal mobility, which is environmentally harmful but creates huge profits for oil and gas industry
3730 2018-08-18 22:55:41 A few years ago they published a similar opinion piece. It was part of my basis (together with @CarbonBubble  report on stranded assets) to leave oil/gas exploration and cancel my membership. By fighting to retain the status quo they will forfeit chance at a smooth transition.
3731 2018-08-18 22:55:39 That's because you have it away to Russia. And you losing you foothold in the Middle East. Soon we will have no place to fly our planes from. When we start the next war  means we have to go in on foot. Casualties. Try to give oil to Saudi they don't own. Your no slick.
3732 2018-08-18 22:55:17 Representing America in Canada this week by buying 12 diet cokes at the airport kiosk and telling people in some parts of the US you can still trade crude oil for basic living needs
3733 2018-08-18 22:55:15 Dismay in dad's voice as I told him of the oil vadapavs.
3734 2018-08-18 22:54:44 I heard that MONSTER strangled his two little girl's! Threw them into an oil WELL! AGAIN I'll say it, EXECUTE that POS! #WorldNewsTonight @ABCWorldNews
3735 2018-08-18 22:54:24 Running a bit rugged, bit rough need oil but, I got 2 100IM and, 4-50M in to swim for a half hour stroke, swim—I meant soak.. lol, yeah, soak that's it.
3736 2018-08-18 22:54:18 It doesn't smell the best but if you put apple cider vinegar and lavender oil in a spray bottle, spritz and air dry, apply as often as you can, it will be pain free by tomorrow. My husband calls what I do here "She-Witchery".
3737 2018-08-18 22:54:15 Was riding around this morning, wanted to get an oil change then realized this check has to last me 2 weeks. Then got groceries,struggled with the bags. Toyota guard came down, tried to fix it. This is when I realized how I’m just outchea, alone in the world 
3738 2018-08-18 22:54:07 Yeah. I had coconut oil so I added some, I’ll see what that does lol
3739 2018-08-18 22:53:54 It’s the power of the influence of Saudi oil money + Clinton/Obama corruption
3740 2018-08-18 22:53:25 Today, I’ve worked out, cleaned my makeup brushes, washed my hair, oil pulled and did laundry. I think this deserves some #Adulting tonight

3743 2018-08-18 22:53:17 This is almost certainly going to be made with truffle aroma, yet your prev post declared ‘never use truffle oil - ever’. Might need a bit of consistency. BTW, truffle oil has its place - just not my place...
3744 2018-08-18 22:53:10 I don’t.  Olive oil spray and season.
3745 2018-08-18 22:52:31 They steal the money the oil and the gold of Iraq then they want the Arabs to pay the blood money. Later to protect Israel to destroy Asad regime, they support terrorists rebel groups that’s where the $230 million was going to. These terrorists killed more Muslim than any others!
3746 2018-08-18 22:52:10 The 43 tracked oil all around the track.

One team came over the radio and said this was going to take awhile to clean up as a result.
3747 2018-08-18 22:52:04 You'll have to ask the US, China & Japan that,I don't know how we would manage. We once had an oil spill from a ship called the Torry canyon. We managed that ok. That was a long time before you can remember.

3749 2018-08-18 22:51:54 Let’s get the heck out of the ME. I say if they want to be cool and trade and sell oil fine if not then fine we move on. We don’t need their problems. #FreeInfowars #MAGA
3750 2018-08-18 22:51:54 I took my uncle's car to the Lexus service place for an oil change and the waiting area have free snacks, coffee, water, soda, phone charge station, and a computer lab. Is this how rich people live because I can't relate 99.9% of the time 
3751 2018-08-18 22:51:15 NOOO there’s reg and then there’s ones with olive oil ?? There’s many kinds I love them all but I love THAT one in the picture she’s beautiful

3755 2018-08-18 22:50:07 The idea of the article is excellent but claimings need to be proved statistically. Did really collapse of Venezuela's oil export increase global oil prices or was that the only effect that caused more expensive oil at that time?
3756 2018-08-18 22:50:04 SWEET

3764 2018-08-18 22:48:19 An intro to painting class should not revolve around oil paints. Oil paint is a fucking bitch for making me use paint thinner. I am pretty sure I can make just as good of paintings with acrylic paints. But if you use oil paints, good for you.

3772 2018-08-18 22:47:01 I just need an oil change 
3773 2018-08-18 22:46:55  nice!! Just swallowed about 100 mg of some rick Simpson oil!
3774 2018-08-18 22:46:17 Stupid ass Rose ate the cap & glass part that the cap screws onto of my $50 maracuja oil so it’s spilled on my bed. The whole thing.
3775 2018-08-18 22:46:10 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and is now at large.
3776 2018-08-18 22:46:04 Talking about territorial waters as well! How do you prevent oil or chemical or nuclear waste spills to drift into your waters if you do not work in collaboration with EU and other groups on environmental norms & regulations to prevent them?? 
3777 2018-08-18 22:45:43 I seasoned it and coated both sides with a little olive oil.
3778 2018-08-18 22:45:25 Clean coal technology is used now.  Plants in the us that extract coal capturing 95% of the carbon dioxide, which is used to pump out oil.  Oh no!  Not oil!!  The EPA should roll regulations back. It’s 2018, not 1998.  Being nuclear energy back too.  Advances far outpace dangers
3779 2018-08-18 22:45:14 I need an oil change

3786 2018-08-18 22:43:45 The tax cut went to Big Oil & your helping the middle class is completely delusional

3791 2018-08-18 22:42:59 Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Big Pharma, Healthcare industries, Big Oil which Tom Perez just changed the DNC rules back to accept all are against the average person...how can anything change big that's how they're funded. They won't work against the people who get them elected
3792 2018-08-18 22:42:39 Thank you President Trump. About time we keep our money here. If we didn't buy their oil they would be broke.
3793 2018-08-18 22:42:19 It makes sense. Putin pissed off at the world for the Magnitsky act, so he tries to sow chaos in tevenge as his oil empire shrinks.
3794 2018-08-18 22:42:13 Fuck that monkey oil. Get high.
3795 2018-08-18 22:42:08 No he wasn't. Abetted the Rwandan genocide, he and his scumbag son pocketed millions in Oil for Food payoffs from Iraq, and he did nothing to damp down the rampant anti-Israeli mob behavior in the General Assembly.
3796 2018-08-18 22:42:06 This leeching, racist, snake oil salesman Sharpton is a joke. He's as big of a buffoon as Maxine Waters.

That's weird.

3809 2018-08-18 22:39:50 Everyone wants cheap Russian gas or oil. That's the prize. That's why Germany wants a new pipeline. We all are dependent on the gas to power our societies. Can't blame the Austrians for doing more than Merkel. Germany does not share its cheap price with others..
3810 2018-08-18 22:39:28 Don’t cook naked, or that oil gon light ya tits up..
3811 2018-08-18 22:39:25 Made me sick to hear all the excuses during a @CNN interview with a so called expert. I don't give a shit what color he is. When a person murders their family & tosses the bodies in oil barrels, they have forfeited their right to draw breath.
3812 2018-08-18 22:39:22 A bit technical, but in molecular biology we used to use mineral oil to prevent evaporation. One coworker was asked by a trainee why it was used and her reply was "I think it helps it go through the capillary better."

3816 2018-08-18 22:38:58 Great tune. Though my god that movie was awful...Hmmm, its easier to train oil riggers to be astronauts than the other way round you say?...
3817 2018-08-18 22:38:39 My understanding is that upwards of 80% of Venezuelans live in poverty and the economy is experiencing massive inflation, unemployment, and that even their oil exports have steadily diminished over the past 15 years. It’s hard for me to understand why socialism is not to blame.
3818 2018-08-18 22:38:33 It’s worth a try. It’s a pantry staple for me. Seems very similar. But the S&B chili oil with crunchy garlic has MSG in it... So it’s probably better.

3847 2018-08-18 22:31:06 Pres. Trump. Treasonous Obama’s USA changed USA oil export ruling. Ending Carter’s ban on USA sourced oil to be exported ended a USA strategic necessity. It will be painful for us Americans at the pumps. Don’t let the globalists suck USA down the drain like the EU.

3859 2018-08-18 22:29:33 Why is Saudi Arabia our ally? Oh, oil.
3860 2018-08-18 22:29:26 @CPC_HQ and @liberal_party support ethnic cleansing, by selling arms to Saudi Arabia. We have enough oil and sand in Canada, we can tell them to F off!

3862 2018-08-18 22:29:17 @GovernorKayIvey please address the issue of medical marijuana for those of us in great pain. Why must Ala. Be last on this. I am not a smoker but know the oil can help. Please reply.SAY SOMETHING.UAB IS SUPPOSE TO HAVE RESEARCH GOING ON BUT NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING. PLEASE,THANKYOU
3863 2018-08-18 22:28:57 Who first thought to fry things? Like who decided it was a good idea to put sliced potatoes in a pot of boiling oil???
3864 2018-08-18 22:28:53 I hope so! Yeah that doesn't even make any sense to take away a panic attack treating medication without trying to put you on something else for panic attacks.  Kind of leaving you up the proverbial creek with that one.  I hope CBD oil works and I am considering trying it for BP
3865 2018-08-18 22:28:39 Curious to what your attribute the massive economic growth? All based on oil prices? And to what do you attribute the current problems?
3866 2018-08-18 22:28:18 Maybe you should end the $4 billion annual subsidy to oil companies, if you're so intent on improving the US. You could also cut the corporate subsidies in your tax cut for the rich.

You could stop visiting your properties to make money & minimize your golfing.

Billions saved!
3867 2018-08-18 22:28:16 The global rule elite are controlling it...they own the UN+EU. The UN is no longer the body it was set up to be after WW2 to keep World Peace-it now controls the peace..oops WARS! All about ££€€$$ & oil in Iran. The controllers of open borders& main stream media-very left wing

3869 2018-08-18 22:27:51 Yeah, we just send it on over, nobody actually orders it. We store it all in our individual igloos, and smear it in whale oil to preserve it.
3870 2018-08-18 22:27:41 @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump 
Of the approximately 7.3 billion barrels of petroleum consumption, 47% is motor gasoline (includes ethanol), 20% distillate fuel (heating oil and diesel fuel), and 8% jet fuel. 
Green Transportation is focus. #TESLA @elonmusk @EIAgov
3871 2018-08-18 22:27:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
3872 2018-08-18 22:27:03 As an oil backed nation with an educated work force in a peaceful part of the world with fisheries, whisky, tourism, finance etc? Yes, who would lend to us? Who are you trying to kid? You better sort England out, because you're £2Tn in debt: who's going to bail you out?
3873 2018-08-18 22:26:44 Many of my mom’s friends have been told by physicians to use cannabis or cbd oil for their health and emotional problems. These are mostly wealthy women over 75 who would have been against marijuana in the past. Now it’s saving their golden years!

3875 2018-08-18 22:26:03 I spray dry coconut oil in my hair sometimes and my dog will just show up behind me out of nowhere every time. I just realized he stands behind me to eat it out of the air??? I guess it’s yummy!
3876 2018-08-18 22:25:58 Lemme gist you. So I was at the barber shop this evening and the boys there were seriously talking about how Duncan Mighty got wealthy from Militancy, Oil Bunkering, & Drug pushing.
My point is,  boys confidently talk about things they are not sure of, just for the sake of Gist.
3877 2018-08-18 22:25:54 Conman and snake oil salesman and rabble rouser!
3878 2018-08-18 22:25:49 Went to get an oil change, bought a new car. 

I suck.
3879 2018-08-18 22:25:41 1. Not the speciality, but mainly;
2. Type of oil they’re cooked in.

(As I understand it).
3880 2018-08-18 22:25:33 1 of those days where you take the car in for a $2k oil change. U know, go in for an oil change & get the call that the car needs $2k ... an a/c compressor etc. ummm ... not today #surprises
3881 2018-08-18 22:25:29 My mom uses hemp oil for hers, and she gets it really bad. It’s done wonders.

-He’s a RACIST! (“Fine people on both sides”, NFL sons of bitches, his birther BS, etc)

-He’s a FAILED SNAKE OIL SALESMAN! (“Trade wars are good + easy to win”, tariff debacle, lying or confused about econ data)
3883 2018-08-18 22:25:11 I use coconut oil now but it doesn’t last. I havnt tried mixing it w baking soda though!
3884 2018-08-18 22:24:43 Excellent article Gavin. Very worrying how so many people can be fooled by snake oil salesmen like Farage and Rees-Mogg. These people think the year is 1818 and that Britain is still an empire. Certain newspapers have shown their true colours since Brexit began.
3885 2018-08-18 22:24:22 The Southwest terminal is like being in a quick oil change waiting room. But somehow dirtier and less spacious.
3886 2018-08-18 22:23:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
3887 2018-08-18 22:23:52 blaze has his oil yoo, also his stim pack. im not saying they are the most amazing tanks but blazer definitly has his area, and can easily do some takning well if done right, dont light every oil spill and use your bod. my point is Blaze IS a tank atleast asmuch as Garrosh is

Sez who?The MN DOC, multiple tribes, @SierraClubMN legislators, climate scientists
3890 2018-08-18 22:23:43 I've tried CBD oil, ibuprofen, sleep, and water and I still have a fucking migraine.
3891 2018-08-18 22:23:39 Again, I said it was both sides fault! 77 voted yes, that includes Dems.  The list is below. This has nothing to do with WHY r u upset that Trump is STOPPING our tax dollars to countries that support terrorist or have LOTS of OIL!
3892 2018-08-18 22:23:30 And I seem to remember also a huge scandal from his son Kojo Annan, stealing millions on traffic of influence and the Iraq oil.

3894 2018-08-18 22:23:12 Why don't you emphasize that the KeystoneXL pipeline is going to send CANADIAN oil through the US for EXPORT!! Also, the "ties to Chinese gov't" are over NRDC's activism in China to reign in pollution. But those are inconvenient details, aren't they?
3895 2018-08-18 22:23:10 those Dawn commercials with the baby duck in an oil spill always make me cry
3896 2018-08-18 22:22:58 Except usually snake oil salesmen don't ask to be prepared to use the full extent of the 2nd amendment to "defend against the shadowy deep state"...

Like Pat Robertson or Joel Osteen are hungry for money but they don't advocate "gun resistance against invisible g-men"
3897 2018-08-18 22:22:55 So I’m sitting here waiting for my oil change, this poor lady is asleep on the chair across from me Poor thing probably didn’t get enough sleep last night 
3898 2018-08-18 22:22:10 Under Johnson’s Committee leadership, the US will use taxpayer dollars to build a wall that gives Mexico 1.5 million acres of US territory, Rio Grande River (municipal water source for 1.4 million Americans), and hundreds of oil and gas wells. Disgraceful.

3900 2018-08-18 22:21:56 You just named why it is so hard to legalize marijuana...Big Pharmaceutical companies will not make money.  Recently developed an alternative to cani oil for seizures.  Until the big pharmaceutical can profit, we will have to fight every step of the way.

THAT is NOT an option

i am not criticizing you, just sharing
3903 2018-08-18 22:21:17 Question,
If you take away fossil fuels what happens to Putin’s GDP?
Putin must sell oil/gas or go broke.
The alternative is expansion.
Trump is Putin’s man.
3904 2018-08-18 22:21:10 Last day at the warehouse! Been a good 4 year run! Time to finish this degree come May and then off to the goddamn oil field

3909 2018-08-18 22:20:44 @GarShehu this is how I assess the impact of PMB administration. Peace in the north east, Nigerian airways reactivated, railway transportation restored, decent revenue generation by customs and ports, oil exploration in alkaleri Bauchi State. I think this is a way forward

That's my fear, so lets quickly develop our own country with what ever funds coming from it now, not by sharing money generated from it!
3935 2018-08-18 22:16:27 Dude I feel great. An unexpected bonus was since I did an essential oil treatment in addition to the massage, I got to keep the leftover lotion blend they made. I’m about to start saving pennies to make this happen more often.

3951 2018-08-18 22:13:47 I only condition my hair occasionally (usually right after it’s been coloured). I ise a tony amount of super-light conditioner and leave it in for about 30 seconds. Anything more than that leaves an oil slick behind.
3952 2018-08-18 22:13:42 Any chance you have some snake oil for sale?  Asking for a friend.
3953 2018-08-18 22:13:40 These oil rich countries have plenty of money. Why should we send them money?? They need to either produce more oil or lower the price so our gas prices can come down!!

3957 2018-08-18 22:12:48 I am sure that the mandela effect is also a miracle of God, cos noone believes in it, noone finds it possible, if that is his message about the leaking unexplainable scientific oil from that bible, that nothing is impossible, the oil presents making the unbelieveable seen etc,
3958 2018-08-18 22:12:43 Oil price went as low as $26/bbl.
3959 2018-08-18 22:12:37 Shwuuuure!! This one is in the compound. There's a whole 4-storey between me and it, but my PP always is for rat to swallow the spark plug and drink all the oil.
3960 2018-08-18 22:12:29 No, stop avoiding the logic of your own argument. The person who had $62bn in reserves devalued IMMEDIATELY oil prices crashed. The person who didn’t have enough reserves refused to devalue for more than a year. Please explain the logic of this economics

3962 2018-08-18 22:12:11 Those who believe oil is the key should prepare for the survival of the fittest, now that car producers are producing electrical or rechargeable automobiles!!! Let's divert into farming & other vices to help the future of our great nation rather than depending on oil only!
3963 2018-08-18 22:11:38 Oil price needed to balance budget.

Nigeria: $124
Algeria: $105
Angola: $78
Saudi: $87
Iran: $68
Kazakhstan: $60
Iraq: $54
Kuwait: $48

3973 2018-08-18 22:10:28 Mr. McGahn is just over thinking the situation. That is not Trump's way, to set up subordinates. But what's new for lawyers. Let us hope Mr. McGhan doesn't walk into a Mueller oil skid.
3974 2018-08-18 22:10:24 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
3975 2018-08-18 22:10:24 White “Surpremacists” were Trump’s very first and most active supporters in the election. Dinesh is a Johnny-come-lately to cash in on the hype, a true snake oil salesman. 

Whites are waking up and destroying the left and all you can do is call people racist, a leftist tactic.
3976 2018-08-18 22:10:20 Who does tRump care about?  The forgotten classes (most of whom serve in our military)?

3992 2018-08-18 22:08:21 Very impressed question. Also put, oil demand may drop by over 50% in less than 10yrs as renewable energy is gains more traction. 

How prepared is Nigeria for 50% reductions in demand/price of oil?
3993 2018-08-18 22:08:10 Agreed. I had a 1hr app request where the client wanted me to bring three outfits request for modeling, oil and candles for a massage, he also wanted few songs for a lap dance and “then some fun” it sounded really tempting but I had to pass on that one..
3994 2018-08-18 22:07:59 yes John the oil jobs have bolstered the numbers and our economy thank the lord..we both know you need to stop taking credit for that.
3995 2018-08-18 22:07:46 Oh, you mean just like one of us common snake oil salesman types seething with hate and deception? The rob from the poor give more to the rich? The lock kids in cages after taking them from their parents? Got it. Your Jesus would not be happy. #FakeChristians #FakePresidentTrump
3996 2018-08-18 22:07:45 remind me where you work? apart from underground digging up oil in saudi arabia?
3997 2018-08-18 22:07:33 What is CBD oil?
3998 2018-08-18 22:07:31 @BegumNadiya found some past the date jars of pre prepared spice mixes in oil. Do you think I can keep them indefinitely? I suspect I can. Just asking an expert!

4004 2018-08-18 22:07:21 @ConanOBrien where does baby oil come from? I bet there's a lawsuit in there somewhere.
4005 2018-08-18 22:07:02 Interestingly Cuba does better than Venezuela. Even with the incredible amounts of money vnzla received from oil export in that time period
4006 2018-08-18 22:06:58 i sautéed some half a red onion, crushed minced garlic, and a pepper (forgot which kind but a serrano will work. and instead of vegetable oil i used bacon grease lol
4007 2018-08-18 22:06:42 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
4008 2018-08-18 22:06:36 @jamessmk my only real problem is that people buy the snake oil that this is their way out. its only for the chosen or appointed or the smart. not just anyone but people buy into it
4009 2018-08-18 22:06:31 When you take your car in for a $89 oil change and you get a $3200 estimate for car repairs......

NEW CAR TIME! 
4010 2018-08-18 22:06:26 Olive oil tastes so fucking good
4011 2018-08-18 22:06:24 I think Hollywood Reporter has rocks in their head to put you at #1.  Your Christianity is only used when it suits you.  Your hypocrisy comes out on numerous tweets.  You are more of a snake-oil-salesman.

4014 2018-08-18 22:05:04 Talk about a thread getting Hi-Jacked/I grew up eating Bolleys/their secret was Kirshner's hot dogs & everything cooked in peanut oil/the new(1980's) crinkle fries hold much more salt & that is the difference in taste/they still use the Maine Russet potato which is the "Meatiest"

4022 2018-08-18 22:04:18 Creationist use fossiled fuel to get to work in their cars. They don't even believe I'm how oil is created or the time it takes for the molecules to break down. They couldn't put together a two piece jigsaw puzzle. Fake scientists believe in YEC.
4023 2018-08-18 22:04:12 Sesame oil? 
4024 2018-08-18 22:03:47 Well I think Russia will be getting Syria for the oil like they keep wanting.
4025 2018-08-18 22:03:39 Despite all of the cdn. advantages to #LNG projects worldwide (logistical adv. , weather, large gas reserves, cheap AECO gas prices) we still can’t export our resource. This fact is largely due to gov. policies on taxation & the lack of ability to build oil&gas infrastructure.
4026 2018-08-18 22:03:26 First, make known Nigeria's oil sells from 2015 till date then we can think of other looters. Until then, you are Nigeria's No1 looter!

4036 2018-08-18 22:01:24 Most people object to sending anyone money. Saudi's have been manipulating oil prices to our detriment for years. We don't owe them anything. Also applies to the United Nations.

4048 2018-08-18 21:59:38 Wow, such wonderful words from a snake oil salesman! With all the millions you take in from the gullible who buy your product, do you actually help the children who are born? You are nothing but a Prophet for Profit! And, not a particularly good one at that!

4053 2018-08-18 21:58:29 @luckysmarket I love your market. LOVE! But recently, the one in Neptune Beach cannot seem to make my sandwich correctly. Its depressing. Today, for example, there wasn't any bacon (which seems to be reoccurring thing) and they put oil and vinegar on it.

4060 2018-08-18 21:57:40 Yesterday at work this creepy ass white dude started talking to me while he was waiting for his oil change and I was being nice but he was so nosy and then he asked if I had kids or was married cuz I was wearing rings but not on my ring finger and I was like nooo I’m only 21

4065 2018-08-18 21:56:54 Yeah, I don't think Putin is broke. Don't quote me, but he used to be KGB & I think he got a lot of his money that way[doing dirty, sneaky deals].  Along with oil too, which is where the oligarchs come in. They NEED the sanctions lifted 'cause they're losing money bigtime.

Going forward at a doubling time of three years, oil price, per barrel hits $120 per barrel 2021

Can you inbox me your email address @ Union of Concerned Scientists?

4134 2018-08-18 21:44:54 about to play a prank on L involving oil. wonder how it'll go.
4135 2018-08-18 21:44:47 @MazdaUSA you’ll  this.  Wife took 2018 CX9 in for service since low oil pressure  was on.  @johnhinemazda told her the SUV takes special oil because of special engine.  Really what a joke.

4141 2018-08-18 21:44:02 Generally it’s people who have dropped into a senior sales environment and haven’t a clue how to increase sales, so they pay assholes who never sold anything other than snake oil to talk utter bollocks to largely rookie sales staff n then blame them when it goes wrong
4142 2018-08-18 21:43:47 oh right I thought people knew as I usually brag about it, but it's Romeo's, like a minute away from where I live. It's amazing. 

Though I'm also lowkey waiting for US army to invade because of all the oil :|

4148 2018-08-18 21:43:11 OPEC is about 60% of global oil exports and has a very tight grip on prices if they can work together.
FB, GOOG, AAPL, TWTR are a source of news for more than 2/3 Americans. And this is growing, so any collusion between them on information is something to worry about.
4149 2018-08-18 21:43:09 Hmm. Do you think a $770B military 2018 is us 1st when we protect oil in iraq & opium in Afgh? Do u understand the diff between news/press & talk show entertainment news? The FBI & CIA are as diff as day & night, but have you investigated or simply accepted the truth of others?
4150 2018-08-18 21:43:04 Noises at 6,666 mi?... way too early... maybe forgot to change oil at 5K?...
4151 2018-08-18 21:43:04 Amy car savvy friends that can look at my hood soon? It's stuck. 

My car was hit on the passenger side in the front, the very corner a while back. I cannot get my hood to open, and I need to. I really need help, my car need an oil change and the battery died last night.
4152 2018-08-18 21:42:54 When someone's high and they ask you, it's olive oil is made of olive then what's baby oil made of?  Fucked up your whole meds
4153 2018-08-18 21:42:31 Not only are the west in the middle east stealing land, they are also plundering the oil,the quicker we vote people in who r doing the campaigning instead of the ones who are buying themselves into power with safe seats the better, 4 they have abused Labour for the cash @LBC

4165 2018-08-18 21:41:11 Bruh after you get done organizing the fitting rooms at @nordstromrack can you come help me with an oil change?
4166 2018-08-18 21:41:07 Check the oil level... is it low again? 
The senders can gunk up with old age and give a low reading BUT your earlier picture showed it working fine so id assume you have a leak or youre burning it?

4171 2018-08-18 21:40:29 That's a bold prediction to make. I hope it comes true. Which data point makes you think that way? Personally, I see challenging times ahead. Govt would surely go for populist policies in the election year, GST collections are not in line with expectations, oil price is... (1/2)
4172 2018-08-18 21:40:14 cool we should blame the oil companies for padding their margins when the price/bbl is down

Economy booming now in Texas since the cuffs have come off. Only 5 countries produce more oil a day than Texas. Unleash

4177 2018-08-18 21:39:21 I'm old enough to remember when every leftist on the planet claimed Mueller was a Bush crony lying about WMDs so we could invade for oil and enrich Halliburton.  Now he's your savior because you suffer from TDS.

4181 2018-08-18 21:38:47 Let me see if I get this right. Your wheat thins are made with vegetable oils that cause inflammation along with the grain breaking down into sugar. Then you cut out some of the oil and sell it as "reduced fat". Voila! Crap food and it's "healthier" alternative.

4185 2018-08-18 21:38:11 Nothing wrong with a little swing oil 
4186 2018-08-18 21:38:02 Honestly my son had us go vegetarian after he found a vid on YouTube that showed how the cows, goats, chickens, pig and such are treated, while being tortured to death.  

We also avoid palm oil too.

4214 2018-08-18 21:33:29 Venezuela’s economy crashed due to a variety of factors including their nationalization of the countries oil reserves, which were then poorly managed and following the global declining price of oil and the governments failure to diversify its economy led to its crash.

4227 2018-08-18 21:31:53 I buy those frozen scallion pancakes from Trader Joes for nights like this.  Last night I made a big green salad, put white beans with olive oil on the side and a scallion pancake on top.  With a good bread, all you need.
4228 2018-08-18 21:31:45 Start with SP fries/something savory. People like SP pie or maple glazed, and they're way too much IMO. So sugary.

4257 2018-08-18 21:27:26 I think a simple google search and looking up the beginning of the regime and oil prices is not difficult

4259 2018-08-18 21:26:56 just wait wdw and JUST WDW will be playing the lucas oil stadium in indy.
4260 2018-08-18 21:26:41 I would argue that the higher-ups oil book that would have more critical lens and you can find almost commentary length comment under higher-ups from other higher-ups calling them out. Example of this would be boom slayers comm F.U.C.K.

4262 2018-08-18 21:26:34 Not really. Green peace protests in canada only Canadian fossil fuels. They do not protest nor are anywhere to be found on our east coast where we import oil from Middle East and other countries. So speaking directly to mike who is “Canadian green peace” my tweet was accurate
4263 2018-08-18 21:26:33 Not talking abt only oil
4264 2018-08-18 21:26:29 Selling out friends, the Kurds. Trump wins, stop aiding Kurds with US money. ABS wins cause Saudi Arabia & UAE pick up the tab. So, money can keep going to extremists the princes financed b4. Turkey wins cause now its easier to place jihadi’s in power. MidEast loses oil price up

4267 2018-08-18 21:25:55 What gave you the ridiculous idea that you live in a free market? Big Oil subsidies amounting to billions in public funds annually is just one of many examples of how we do not. Until last year, the BCLiberals "pay-to-play" scams made BC the least free market in North America.
4268 2018-08-18 21:25:45 it has been proven that English and soccer players amanzi ne oil the 2 they just don't mix 
4269 2018-08-18 21:25:13 Yep. Cuts the oil. Ugh.
4270 2018-08-18 21:25:02 Then we should stay out of it, keep our warships home, let oil companies and fruit companies fight their own battles, but ignorant "less gov" folks don't think that far down the rabbit hole.
4271 2018-08-18 21:24:59 You're so brave I could never thread myself lol. Also tea tree oil after hair removal stops me from breaking out if you've got it around the house. Maybe soap and water would work too? Since I think hair removal might pop out grimy stuff but idk, not an expert
4272 2018-08-18 21:24:49 Incredible to me that the GMC go all guns blazing after the likes of Dr Bawa-Garba but are like, meh whatevs about this snake oil bullshit.
4273 2018-08-18 21:24:49 My stomach destroys damn near everything.  Goes straight into the bloodstream, so any herbals I use, I look for tabs or tinctures that dissolve under the tongue.  The cool part about this CBD is it's water soluble....no alcohol burn. Can be dissolved in oil, but I eat coconut oil

4283 2018-08-18 21:23:37 I took some CBD oil before work and I feel so calm. Is this what it feels like to have a normal brain?
4284 2018-08-18 21:23:30 So I guess we're just not gonna mention the Oil-for-Food scandal at all, huh? Okay.
4285 2018-08-18 21:23:27 Sometimes I threaten to clean the tub with coconut oil so I can cash in on accidental death insurance. It’s a joke because, 1) I wouldn’t want to scrub the tub afterwards for my own shower, and 2) we aren’t married/have insurance policies benefitting each other.

4298 2018-08-18 21:21:26 This is a coming (or perhaps overdue) challenge for AB oil and gas policy. 

Blessed with massive high capex resources AB policies will need to acknowledge greater volatility in a world market that is increasingly demand driven vs supply managed.

4371 2018-08-18 21:11:33 1 tsp olive oil, tin of chopped toms, cook 10 min, add basil leaves. Add  cooked pasta & grated cheese.Tasty & cheap. You can add any of following to toms- chick peas, lentils, peppers, courgette. onion. cauli. Very filling, not expensive, not time consuming

4395 2018-08-18 21:08:30 Well, this is the reason i started using oil instead of body lotion or cream. The Nuxe is fab but £32 per bottle every 4 weeks is an extravagance even for me!
4396 2018-08-18 21:08:25 Olive oil is great for chapped lips. I’ve used it to remove eye make-up as well when I’ve run out of the usual stuff.  For the body you can buy a plain “carrier” oil from aromatherapy suppliers and add your own scent. It’ll be lighter than Olive oil, less likely to attract flies.

4403 2018-08-18 21:07:18 ps coconut oil smells different and can also be used instead of expensive chemical lubricants if you get what I mean. Get the solid organic kind. Lidl do a really nice one.
4404 2018-08-18 21:07:15 Fair enough. Coconut oil smells a bit yuck to me.
4405 2018-08-18 21:07:12 @Femi_Sorry desperately disappointed you think #Scotland should stay in UK. Look at all the people who say England when they mean UK, BBC especially.   Oil money wasted, devolution in real danger. All to satisfy Nazism.
4406 2018-08-18 21:07:04 Wrong. I said that the Holy oil is a gift from God. Don't twist my words to suit you. Jesus took the Holy oil from the evil priests and gave it back to the common man which was illegal. Sound familiar? He anointed the people and healed them with it. Do you understand anointing?
4407 2018-08-18 21:07:03 Evident to yourself but no one else. Run along now and pump some more oil while you still can.
4408 2018-08-18 21:06:51 Movie Quotes: "Friendship and money: oil and water". Al Pacino (The Godfather)
4409 2018-08-18 21:06:41 Cast iron skillet is the answer to your problems. Use an oil with a high smoke point and give a good sear at the end of the cooking process.

4411 2018-08-18 21:06:37 Oil is to water as black people are to satire.
4412 2018-08-18 21:06:19 Peak oil, peak festival, peak Netflix comedy special, peak peak.
4413 2018-08-18 21:06:19 Yes. You're talking to an Indian! My mum always used it. She put the bottle on the radiator in the hall to liquify it. But I'm not keen on the smell of coconut oil. I have really dry skin and have to use something.
4414 2018-08-18 21:06:03 You shouldn’t have anything to do with anyone subbing me. That’s how it’s supposed to be. I don’t even want to get your point
4415 2018-08-18 21:05:36 Eat a pussy like olive oil, call her Kool-Aid. Ya know.
4416 2018-08-18 21:05:20 Standard Oil anyone?
4417 2018-08-18 21:05:00 Congratulations dear,I wish you a fruitful career full of Barakah
4418 2018-08-18 21:04:54 Coconut oil away better. you can even use it on your hair!
4419 2018-08-18 21:04:51 What do you think President Trump is working on??? Bringing out all the free energy inventions and discoveries that some have been killed for. Who our the big oil and gas owners? How long have they been making money off the populations?
4420 2018-08-18 21:04:21 @LYRISSSMITH done put all types of oil on my head tryna get this quick weave out 
4421 2018-08-18 21:04:16 Coconut oil? I read aquaphor in several places too

4423 2018-08-18 21:04:08 Trying to be productive today. Got my hair cut, changed the oil in my car, and did a little shopping. ^^

4425 2018-08-18 21:04:00 想定外の自体がちょっと起きて軽く困惑してる（
4426 2018-08-18 21:03:56 ‘The girl I walked into the cinema with when I looked at her during the film has changed? ... she looked different? Turns out the popcorn was cooked in peanut oil and she was allergic’
4427 2018-08-18 21:03:46 I totally agree and I didn’t watch either.  Putting an avowed hater on MSNBC should be like oil and water.
4428 2018-08-18 21:03:42 It depends on what suits your skin. It can be great for some people. It can leave a bit of a smell too but that varies with oil & people. Coconut oil works for some people, jojoba or almond for others. It’s a case of try and see.
4429 2018-08-18 21:03:40  Satanic oil?! Maybe she should filly it up with holy water next time 
4430 2018-08-18 21:03:36 I agree that if oil prices do not rise further! which seems not a possibility at the moment. Nothing to do with Lira though. Whatever the devalue happening is directly proportional to what govt is performing considering imports were always a factor.
4431 2018-08-18 21:03:28 You are right you know...there was a third person. I just saw the picture as her and the giraffe.

4433 2018-08-18 21:03:13 Pretty obvious he was not a rich republican. I worked very hard for him to get elected. Months into his presidency he deregulated oil and I figured I had worked for nothing. No question then or now that he was a good man & I am happy w/him.
4434 2018-08-18 21:03:12 I see ,then you're flng ursef
4435 2018-08-18 21:03:05 I don't think KSA is missing any of it. I believe KSA is putting oil where it best serves their price goals. At the moment, the goal is to decrease price, so loading up US inventories. In past, wanted to drop price, so loaded up CN, and made areas that report stock #'s use stocks
4436 2018-08-18 21:02:53 Coconut oil toilet roll is my new favourite thing!
4437 2018-08-18 21:02:47 You might be a Nebraskan living in Mason, Ohio if: you’re the only one in your neighborhood that changes his own oil, paints his own house, and mows his own lawn.

Daniel has plans of his own; to become a man made entirely of oil. An Oil Man.
4439 2018-08-18 21:02:36 3. Avocado and vitamin e face mask 
Vitamin e oil is great with getting rid of stubborn acne scars. When combined, these ingredients produce a powerful anti-acne due for a clearer complexion.
4440 2018-08-18 21:02:33 Lol I hv nothing to do with them subbing you or not,I'm just making a point,which I hope you get.
4441 2018-08-18 21:02:33 She would not even exist, as she banned not just oil and gas but stoped new coal mines. So none of the steal, glass and plastics to make her exists, rails don't exist, neither do the steel pylons or the concrete foundations. No oil, gas or coal we go back to stone age.

Then return them to the sauteed butter, pressing them together into a patty. Toast bread, and sliced tomato.
4443 2018-08-18 21:02:25 double it for every time i was told kimbap smelled weird bc of sesame oil
4444 2018-08-18 21:02:08 Saudi has oil, Norway has oil, both have sovereign wealth funds that earn income. The UK blew its oil bonanza on buying off voters. Luxembourg has $4Tn in assets under management, which generates a significant government income. It also owns companies.
4445 2018-08-18 21:02:06 Kenna, the fries McDonald's has now are a poor comparison to the delights of yesteryear. Used to be they'd make them FRESH at each store daily - raw potatoes, peeled (mostly), slice, wash out starch, blanch in hot oil, then fry when needed. THOSE were perfect fries.
4446 2018-08-18 21:01:55 The science is solid. Magnesium is right up there with Zinc (which also has a PCA version) as far as oil controlling & anti-inflammatory properties. I’m not saying to use MoM on your face but actual skin products with it? Worth a go.
4447 2018-08-18 21:01:49 1. Oatmeal and coconut oil face mask 
Coconut oil has antibacterial properties so it’s best for fighting acne. Oatmeal has the ability to make your face smooth. Just add some worm water to the mix and apply on your face.
4448 2018-08-18 21:01:47 Let me clarify my answer. I WILL be changing the oil again, I just won't be making that mistake again.
4449 2018-08-18 21:01:36 Haba haba show some remorse
4450 2018-08-18 21:01:36 It was  Sesame oil that used a candlestick to break the trucks

4460 2018-08-18 21:00:35 I think it's too heavy and has too strong a smell. Something like almond oil or grapeseed oil might be more pleasant.
4461 2018-08-18 21:00:27 Says the man who uses vacuous  insults & brings up Venezuela as the only example of a socialist country, without knowing that under Chavaz poverty, illiteracy & infant mortality was dramatically reduced but a reliance on oil & US have sanctions have made things very difficult.

4471 2018-08-18 20:59:08 Whereas Godly & forthright pastors can hardly support CAN in their unjustified war against PMB, private jet flying, oil block desiree & money grabbing pastors would naturally see him as an enemy. His war against corruption is negatively impacting on their biz

4475 2018-08-18 20:58:33 The arguments then by scholars & politicians has been born out with decades of conflict 

My personal view Israel was largely supported and economically propped by the U.S to get a military foothold in the Middle East to influence countries whose economy relied on Oil

4482 2018-08-18 20:57:29 I'm a Tyson Fury fan; but I struggle to see how this performance will help in any way to sell the Wilder fight states side. They love toe to toe wars. Wilder v Fury won't be that. The plan tonight though I guess was to gain rounds & oil the chain further.

4484 2018-08-18 20:56:58 That's where I'm at. I'm like, "Yes, this cartoon was written in the spirit of genuine love for Kofi Annan by a cartoonist who has shown time and again that he isn't a fan of racism, so what in God's name is up with that depiction of Kofi as a shiny human oil slick."

4491 2018-08-18 20:56:26 I know this is a daft q but bear with:
I use Nuxe Riche body oil after showering. It's lovely but a bit pricey. Is using olive oil instead a sensible option or a bit weird
4492 2018-08-18 20:56:22 I agree with you
#Britain's greed for cheap oil saw them arm #Saudi and support a blockade against #Yemen which staved children to death. It is a truly genocide In yemen,
This aggression is illegal and The silence, about this issue, is criminal.
4493 2018-08-18 20:56:21 this "extra penetrating" hair oil really is the only action I'm getting right now
4494 2018-08-18 20:56:21 I hope oil companies go out of business soon. They are huge problems, too few people making so much money while destroying nature and our grandchildren s future. I'd rather walk.
4495 2018-08-18 20:56:17 Ricotta on focaccia bread. Mmmmm a little olive oil.
4496 2018-08-18 20:56:12 People actually be tweeting about 'sex dreams' like it's some normal thing, enjoying and bragging about  the orgasms they've been getting.

4497 2018-08-18 20:56:06 I really really like it and its not as invasive as thc oil. It's legit medicine and you just live life.

4507 2018-08-18 20:54:37 There has probably not been a supplement with more negative studies. I think they need to go back to the dietary studies and look for something in the fish besides the oil that is beneficial like protein composition.

4521 2018-08-18 20:53:12 So why are you against scots running thier country?
Why are you against scots being as indy as UK was for 40 years in EU
In EU our votes wont be ignored and we will have some protection when westminster tries to keep scots oil and gas
4522 2018-08-18 20:53:01 After the shah and his family left, iran was chaotic. The religious leaders took control of the government. Tisnt the first time for a country to have religious leaders as heads. See Vaticano. Iran has oil (2nd or 3rd in the world & has support from Russia, China, India...)

80% is in scottish waters 20% in English waters not including the 6K miles and 6 rigs Blair stole the night before scots parly opened
4532 2018-08-18 20:51:03 That and baby oil...
4533 2018-08-18 20:50:39 If you view renewables and batteries as a substitute for nuclear *before* coal, gas and oil are eliminated from our power systems, then we have very different assessments of how dire the climate challenge is...

People from neighboring countries used to wait long and hard for visas to cross into Venezuela to work in oil and mining.

All over the world nations insist on respect for their borders.

As a consequence of that process, industry asked for Ms. Berman to co-chair OSAG (confirmed by Min Phillips). Blame Steve Williams.
4571 2018-08-18 20:45:27 @TEDTalks heard Rosen today “End of men”-“End of housing” is more like it. Women w business, arts and finger painting degrees rule but, shortage of skilled tradesMEN is turning us into a poor country . “Women will rule the world until the oil need to b changed”
4572 2018-08-18 20:45:23 Well Islam seems to be sitting on some oil. Every war has been about land/resources. Anyone who thinks the crusades were ideological has missed the point. Its always a land grab or money. Ideology is used to control a population and terrorise.

4687 2018-08-18 20:28:10 my dad really just ruined my day by telling me my car needs an oil change 
4688 2018-08-18 20:28:07 Trump must not be allowed to be voted into the presidency for a second term. His base has sadly been duped by a classic snake oil salesman because they were not taught history and government properly. When education fails, superstition reigns ie Deep State.
4689 2018-08-18 20:28:07 #BeforeSummerEnds every night during the final 2 weeks, I get naked and rub myself down with olive oil before I go to bed.
4690 2018-08-18 20:27:59 I just use jojoba oil daily and it's hands down the best for my skin. I have a mix of really dry skin and some mild t zone acne, usually hormonal. Jojoba oil doesn't clog my pores so no negative contribution to acne (for me) and hydrates the dry better than anything I've tried 
4691 2018-08-18 20:27:49 Wow.
I get splashed in the eye with hot oil.
And then after work, I’m still waiting for a 20 minute late bus.
4692 2018-08-18 20:27:41 Go coconut oil, its medium chain fatty acids are less likely to be stored as fat by the body.
4693 2018-08-18 20:27:01 Eating a bad plate of oil down here girl.
4694 2018-08-18 20:26:58 China is not capitulating, they are continuing to negotiate trade deals and cutting out key US created products and farming goodsgoods from future deals (like oil and soy bean imports). 

They are being the responsible world leader of trade. Eventually we will capitulate to them.
4695 2018-08-18 20:26:55 Matched with a girl who just moved from  fort McMurray and she says her parents are in the oil business let’s gooooooooooooooooo #marryingrich
4696 2018-08-18 20:26:53 Also if you use oil olive instead of shave cream or anything it helps soften and reduced razor burn, as well as it is less prickly when it grows back
4697 2018-08-18 20:26:47 My roommate @Squirrelyouhit is actually the best person in the world! He really took my car to go get an oil change at his job (on his day off) along with getting me all new windshield wipers and a new oil plug all for FREE! Friend goals right there my dudes!

4712 2018-08-18 20:25:13 You're welcome. Just try and get Shea butter and coconut oil and it will make it easier for you to manage.
4713 2018-08-18 20:25:05 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

4719 2018-08-18 20:24:13 That's just garlic mayonnaise tho. 

Aioli is smashed garlic, oil, and lemon juice.
4720 2018-08-18 20:24:01 Keep talking snake oil salesman. Everytime you open your mouth, another tRump cabinet member gets indicted.
4721 2018-08-18 20:24:00 Germany is desperate for Russian oil, all of Western Europe for business with Iran. They don't care abt the big bad Bear, or abt Israel or Iran having nukes (they know the deal is a joke). They don't care if Russia is a threat to Eastern Europe (not the US). But our 'resistance'?
4722 2018-08-18 20:23:51 I can't imagine or believe how a father could kill his own pregnant wife and put his daughters in oil tanks...Lord, please come soon. 
4723 2018-08-18 20:23:41 My lower back has been KILLING me all day. (It hurts most of the time, tbh.) I took half a dropper of my CBD oil and my back feels 20x better than it did.

Even countries like iran, Iraq, Venezuela and major oil resource countries are still struggles. 1/n.

4727 2018-08-18 20:23:18 Barkha - perhaps also share that both Bush and Blair both said that God told them to destroy iraq when it was politics of oil ! That’s just as bad as the comments made in Kerala

4736 2018-08-18 20:21:53 The chips are nice but I reckon they're nicer roasted in olive oil with chunky onion bits.. as a more regular thing..
4737 2018-08-18 20:21:43 I do thank Bruce. Miracles worked to turn our oil tanker heading to rocks. BUT he really don’t help himself. Players out of position,1 up front always,preseason 3 at back then nothing, O’Hare (*!),GK! but why when have FK 10yards over half way line do we not all get up pitch!
4738 2018-08-18 20:21:43 @JasonJHunter Hi. Watching three blokes in a pub the most startling thing you said (Ep1) amongst others was with no deal Brexit we can't import oil. How much have we got stockpiled? The country will stop functioning when it runs out.
4739 2018-08-18 20:21:38 For those of my friends that love their family, their animals horses dogs and cats, even chickens, would you like info about the oil that is changing lives?Comment below 
4740 2018-08-18 20:21:03 Sounds nice! ,I went to this lady before who puts some sort of oil on your temples then massages them and massages your head
4741 2018-08-18 20:21:02 You look like you’re sitting for an oil painting in all of these. It’s okay to smile.

4744 2018-08-18 20:20:47 So the baby oil is not made of babys?
4745 2018-08-18 20:20:38 Not even in my wildest dreams would I think of getting cloves or Clive oil.

4749 2018-08-18 20:20:04 What kindd any oil?
4750 2018-08-18 20:20:04 oil  companies, subsidies to farmers, etc.....  Seems that if the   government  can subsidize oil companies and farmers; they should be  able  to  "subsidize" the minimum wage.
4751 2018-08-18 20:19:57 They needa hurry changing my oil , I still gotta go home and get ready and leave in an hour wtf

4758 2018-08-18 20:18:00 Hmm yeah they may be drying out your face too much which is then causing your face to overproduce oil which then creates more acne...
4759 2018-08-18 20:17:59 Hmmmm never tried oil before.

4762 2018-08-18 20:17:42 I thank him.  I think he is right.  The tides are turning.

We are seeing a resurgence of British good sense.

I really cannot believe that my neighbours will keep swallowing the snake oil.

They are NOT that gullible.

Scarcity through inconsistency
4769 2018-08-18 20:17:26 2- I'm not defending the EU but do understand their stance. I don't understand our stance of wanting all the benefits but no obligations. It's not rational.

The shame belongs to the snake oil salesman who said we'd be better off but had no plan

How are the EU sacrificing lives?
4770 2018-08-18 20:17:25 The application idea to merge all oil and gas jobs at one app is very smart
However the app has lots of issues. I tried applying for #OGC vacancies but the signing in details isn't synced with the petrojobs credentials. And lots of people are complaining about the same issue
4771 2018-08-18 20:17:19 Kofi Annan  left a legacy of personal corruption and nepotism, human rights abuses by UN peacekeepers, oil for food scandal, and failure. The perfect Nobel Peace Prize winner, in other words. I keep wondering when they'll give it to Blair.
4772 2018-08-18 20:17:16 And begging for subsidies to boot. This snake oil salesman days are numbered.
4773 2018-08-18 20:17:02 Still a No from me, I'm actually speaking in reference to them. They're just oil and I honestly regret trying to give them another chance

4784 2018-08-18 20:15:18 All travelers must comply w/ federal law on transporting marijuana & cannabis products, such as CBD oil, on board flights. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement if they discover these products while screening your property.
4785 2018-08-18 20:15:14 Can’t remember if I told you this before, but a bit of peppermint oil around window cracks and the like can be a great natural spider repellent. It’s too strong for their senses. Also keeps away ants.
4786 2018-08-18 20:14:58 If you use holy oil for your hair will it grow super fast?
4787 2018-08-18 20:14:57 Russia bought a few ads & had a few bots on platforms w/ a ton of ads and a lot of bots. IOWs, meaningless. They do give $ to groups like Sierra Club to  protest fracking. Can hate fracking & realize it's in Russia's interest that US produces less oil -

4791 2018-08-18 20:13:51 It’s got absolutely nothing to do with religion. It has everything to do with greedy control of power, land and oil. Gaddafi set the standard for that, unfortunately.
4792 2018-08-18 20:13:50 Yes, the sanctions came after the economic collapse--the same collapse that brought Chavez to power in the first place. The sanctions came after a drop in their oil reserves and Chavez began restricting oil exports to have more for domestic use
4793 2018-08-18 20:13:40 Aloe or coconut oil, sister

4798 2018-08-18 20:12:31 I tried to work on my report, but I couldn't find my bottle of oil.
4799 2018-08-18 20:11:59 And if she'd been found out, she would've loosed on oil slick from her high heels and would've escaped, leaving her stupified foes in her wake.
4800 2018-08-18 20:11:55 Also a criminal who enriched himself through years of crime.  Oil for Food = $$$ for Kofi.

4806 2018-08-18 20:10:54 Okey a tweet storm about what maduro said last night. First they recognized that the price (yesterday) of the BSF/USD was 6.000.000BSF and created they new BSS  and said that is going to be worths they same as the petro which should be tied to the price of the oil (60$ today).

She faced sexism, but she also was far from the most qualified gop woman then.

4820 2018-08-18 20:08:50 Didn’t his son sell Iraqi oil during the embargo, making he and his dad rich? Man, we suffer from long term memory loss.
4821 2018-08-18 20:08:44 Although China has backpedaled on proposed tariffs on U.S. crude imports, the move is indicative of its need to diversify sources and steps may now be taken to enable China to play the oil card in the future – including imports from Iran, and drawing closer to Russia.
4822 2018-08-18 20:08:43 To be expected. Obama knew to leave the fine details to an expert.  When I take my car to the mechanic, I tell him to change the oil, I don't tell him HOW to change the oil.
4823 2018-08-18 20:08:42 Okay so auntie was gonna allow me to put a puff puff in the oil but this is a skill please. Could I even get the dough into a ball?
4824 2018-08-18 20:08:42 From my new book, OIL and GOD:
To breed walking bombs, politicians in Wahhabi garbs brew an explosive cocktail by mixing: 
Jihad injunctions+predestination dogma+promises of houris in paradise.
To explode, the cocktail needs the spark of abuse at home and/or from abroad.

4829 2018-08-18 20:07:55 Agreed, but nationalised oil in 1976 already witnessed a slow decline from then on. I don’t blame Chavez and ‘socialism’ per se but government mismanagement over several administrations were an issue

4842 2018-08-18 20:06:12 You didn’t add the fact that niger delta avengers disrupted crude oil sales which made it almost impossible to earn forex, without savings and extremely low income we were headed for recession naturally
4843 2018-08-18 20:06:09 When Asad Umar made that tweet crude oil was trading at $30. Now it's 60ish.
So roughly double the price & it's 93+. USD to PKR from 104-105 to 120+.
So even if petrol is priced around 110 it would at par with PKR 46 value. 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

4853 2018-08-18 20:04:00 First, absolutely agree and appreciate you standing up.  

Second, “madder than a boiled oil”?  Thank you for that!
4854 2018-08-18 20:03:48 Customer bringing his own oil asks the price, so I tell him. He said it was less.

Checked his history, he was right, but that was because of an extra shave off the top. He didn't have a coupon, and couldn't grasp he was already getting a discount, so he left. 
4855 2018-08-18 20:03:43 Damn near 80$ for a fucking oil change da fuck

4871 2018-08-18 20:02:15 I did R&D for industrial-sized natural gas and fuel oil fired burner systems! In the combustion lab we’d light em up and then measure flame dimensions (up to about ten feet), emissions, etc.
4872 2018-08-18 20:02:03 what about high doses of radiation, chemo, opioids, benzos and their effects on children?  I can show you a video of little Liam McKnight withdrawing from the many benzos he was on.  He never has that with cannabis oil.

4875 2018-08-18 20:01:58 Venezuela had a host of other problems: corruption (minimizable w/ info tech), an economy based largely on commoditized fear (bc of gangs & illicit drug market) & over-dependence on oil exports, & Im not sure their govt wasnt just a type of corruption frequently called socialism
4876 2018-08-18 20:01:42 Fundamentalist? The question is why was there anything other than the oil lamp used? This new fundamentalism is so weak! 
4877 2018-08-18 20:01:41 The only place that you can a large amount of oil is Saudi Arabia (aka ESaudi Arabia. The reason why 9/11 happens is because the elites want to make it as a justification to go to the Middle East to get the oil AKA the wine of the Harlot (Saudi Arabia).

4883 2018-08-18 20:00:38 Go and ask google. Whatever he did wit the oil revenue, the money belongs to Niger-Delta. The real thieves nd looters are not producing oil.

4890 2018-08-18 19:59:44 My skid steer calls for 10W30 as hyd oil. I asked someone who knows these things about topping up with trans/hyd oil. They said not to worry, apparently engine oil is more refined than hyd oil.

Can't wait.

Maybe also a bit on what the best temperature is for the oil when deep frying chips. Looking forward to it.
4898 2018-08-18 19:57:27 Rather watch oil paint dry
4899 2018-08-18 19:57:19 Do you have proof of that or do you just enjoy spouting b*******. Because that's nowhere near true. The government is by far hands down the biggest contributor of money. And few scientists work for oil companies.

4903 2018-08-18 19:56:48 Don’t steam them, that’s why I didn’t like them as a kid. Instead, cut them in half, toss them in coconut oil, add spices and garlic, and put them on a baking tray. Mince bacon and sprinkle on top. Bake at 400, flip in 20 minutes, take out at 40 minutes. Crispy and delicious.
4904 2018-08-18 19:56:06 My dumbass just went and spilled a shit ton of cooking oil
4905 2018-08-18 19:55:52 While getting the oil changed I was forced to watch local news. DJT spoke and I just kept laughing ... how do folks genuinely believe him?

So what's the ROI of investing on the non-oil sector?

4919 2018-08-18 19:52:24 There is a decorum expected of any office being held. Expectations, traditions, regulations, parameters,  restrictions. However, I realize this has escaped you, being raised, as you were, in the #charlatan world of snake oil salesmen.
4920 2018-08-18 19:52:20 Dude, bring your ride here. I'll change your oil 
4921 2018-08-18 19:52:14 Actually the orcas come to the whale watching boats, they like the interaction. There's regulations as to how close boats can go towards them. In fact tourism helps promote their conservation. So, call out big buisness, oil takers and shipping freight liners if you want to help.

4925 2018-08-18 19:51:39 BROOOOOO getting an oil change is so mf annoying 
4926 2018-08-18 19:51:27 Make sense since many countries like United States want to get oil from Saudi Arabia/Harlot. And a Harlot wants Money from these countries who are so desperate for that oil. In a way, its prostitution

4930 2018-08-18 19:50:54 Yes. I drew Norway as a parallel in particular because of nearly similar population size and (previously) oil production output. The problem however, is that wealth is always concentrated in most oil producing countries around the world. It’s a shame. I wish more were like Norway

4932 2018-08-18 19:50:08 Irani Mullah regime is evil. But the real culprits of exporting and funding the global Jihadis are your dear friends- Saudi Barbaria regime. Iran has at best regional proxies. You are spreading propaganda for oil lobby and due to Israeli lobby influence.

4941 2018-08-18 19:48:58 I’ve always loved Carter. Presciently, he installed solar panels on the White House roof which Reagan promptly had ripped out as a sop to big oil. Reagan sent clean energy back for decades because he was a rightwing ideologue.

4957 2018-08-18 19:46:15 Oil of oregano really works
4958 2018-08-18 19:46:12 Like Trump, I feel the need to educate you, regarding the purpose of our Founding Fathers.  Our Founding Fathers escaped England for religious FREEDOM.  Separation of Church and State.  This means you as a snake oil salesman have not liberty to speak against or for the State.
4959 2018-08-18 19:45:53 hello all of us are human beings who know how to talk and know how to laugh and how to understand life how we get or not live every day die no one where we do not think o oil excited human life afraid of fear of suffering

4961 2018-08-18 19:45:27 Guy in front of me at the oil change place apparently couldnt turn down any of the upcharge items. Guess I chose the wrong lane...
4962 2018-08-18 19:45:25 I typically fill the filter halfway with fresh oil before I install it,  then just dip my finger into the oil
4963 2018-08-18 19:45:21 I thought New Orleans was great until I moved here... and paid for my oil change.
4964 2018-08-18 19:45:16 Sorry baby we dont mix like water & oil
4965 2018-08-18 19:45:15 She used lotion first THEN oil too!!! I didn’t need the added oil considering it’s 105° outside!!!
4966 2018-08-18 19:45:03 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4967 2018-08-18 19:45:01 I second this! Vitamin E Oil is my saving grace in the winter time and it works great as a base for makeup.
4968 2018-08-18 19:44:39 The oil industry
4969 2018-08-18 19:44:24 I'll have to get back to you on that.  My oil change is done.

4973 2018-08-18 19:43:50 Natural selection and domestication is oil and water period. Artificial selection is what humans did, i.e. feeding broccoli to Samoyeds
4974 2018-08-18 19:43:48 And do nothing but make excuse after excuse for the white guy. “Family man, look at this recent post from his wife, financial hardships, blah blah blah”. Dude put his baby girls’ bodies in an oil barrel. 
4975 2018-08-18 19:43:40 [1/2] Dave, take a cast-iron skillet. Oil it well up the sides. Then mandoline a bunch of potatoes and red onions, keeping slices intact. Grate a lot of cheese: cheddar is good, adding a little Bruder Basil smoked cheese even better; don't use artificially smoked gouda etc. Then
4976 2018-08-18 19:43:13 my mom made me put this ozone oil all over my face bc it’s covered with pimples and i smell like shit
4977 2018-08-18 19:43:03 Also the amount of potatoes you can eat in the shape of fries is unbelievable (like 3x more than with any other cooking method), I was shocked tonight ! Add the oil and no surprise eating fries regularly makes you fat. Another life mystery solved. Damn Twitter can be useful.
4978 2018-08-18 19:42:58 it’s a product of oil refining babe. it doesn’t add moisture to ur lips, it only traps it so tbh i’d say drink ur water and exfoliate them tings !!
4979 2018-08-18 19:42:39 we have a machine at home, also from clicks mara yona you dont microwave it , it air pops them. i dont like it because the popcorn are dry , and when i season them the salt just sits at the bottom. ii think the oil helps the seasoning to stick
4980 2018-08-18 19:42:30 Use fresh oil
4981 2018-08-18 19:42:28 No. If he teamed up with Osteen and they convinced followers that their fortune would be finding oil in the Sahara? Ally.
4982 2018-08-18 19:42:24 Snake oil salesman of the first order
4983 2018-08-18 19:42:22 Trump needs to go to Chicago.  Screw all this cancelling bcse of threats. Take a whole armored division if that's what it takes to get out message and demonstrate he cares.
4984 2018-08-18 19:42:11 It is no secret that Saudi Arabia and the US are allies and trading partners. US buys Saudi oil and the Saudi's buy US commercial goods and under license buy military goods. Sometimes the export license for military goods may specify limits of use.
4985 2018-08-18 19:41:29 And don't forget his son Kojo and oil-for-food in 2005.  All classy.
4986 2018-08-18 19:41:26 Decline in oil prices from 105 dollars to 25 dollars, decline in foreign reserves from 62 billion in 2008 to 20 billion in 2015. No revenue, no savings=recession. Our debt profile rose because we had to borrow to stabilise the economy and invest in the non-oil sector which took
4987 2018-08-18 19:41:01 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one

4990 2018-08-18 19:40:48 Well India has worlds 2nd largest methane deposits. But nothing like Saudi dig a hole with a crowbar you get clean oil (relative) and simple to process. 
Bottom line economics
4991 2018-08-18 19:40:38 Finnish state-backed refiner Neste has carved out a niche using proprietary processing to turn animal fat and plant oil into renewable diesel. The product has virtually the same chemical properties as diesel made from fossil fuels, but produces a fraction of the carbon emissions.
4992 2018-08-18 19:40:38 My coffee currently contains MCT oil, honey, and hemp milk. I think I need to back down off the hipster shit now...

4998 2018-08-18 19:40:12 Oil corporations have had Albertans bent over the 'oil barrel' for decades. When I worked in Calgary radio people would say "Alberta roads are paved with gold!". Living for todays greed to die tomorrow... what a horrible legacy for my grandchildren, who live in Alberta.
4999 2018-08-18 19:40:08 you should look at the quality of the product and whether or not it is a full range extract or the oil is just a compound of some cheap oil and the pure cbd powder. while the first is really a good quality product, the later is usually just a cheap version-.
5000 2018-08-18 19:40:04 Family Nutrition: Cheez Whiz Cheese Dip this August? Its top four ingredients are whey, milk, canola oil and maltodextrin.
5001 2018-08-18 19:39:38 Can one be a legit conservative bibble-babble and NOT sell some form of snake oil?
5002 2018-08-18 19:39:35 Umm, "just apply coconut oil. It does wonders"
5003 2018-08-18 19:39:30 But the oil is sold almost everywhere. 
5004 2018-08-18 19:39:29 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
5005 2018-08-18 19:39:17 Europe? Wow that’s great! Why don’t they go to the Middle East? Africa? China? Russia? Counties that actually produce more fossil fuels then Canada? To scary for them I’d imagine. Keep painting streets in Europe with oil based paint though 
5006 2018-08-18 19:39:15 "Oil? Who said anything about oil? Bitch you cookin?"
5007 2018-08-18 19:39:09 I didnt notice that. I will have to re-watch. He had to have been contemplating this for awhile. The timeline is telling, also where he placed those kids bodies is another clue to pre-meditation. He knew about those oil tanks so he thought out where he would hide the bodies.
5008 2018-08-18 19:38:52 Nigel is not keen on experts, that for me makes him one of the most self effacing and modest people I know if there is a more qualified expert in snake oil than Nigel I’ve not seen him
5009 2018-08-18 19:38:42 I got a steroid shot. I should look like the rock tomorrow.
5010 2018-08-18 19:38:32 i want to coat my entire body in CBD oil and slither around like the slimey little nasty snake goblin that i am
5011 2018-08-18 19:38:24 He's a snake oil salesman.
5012 2018-08-18 19:38:17 Yeah !! The best from his performings." Oil by food ". When one liter  of oil was bought  0.1 $ . Guess ، who the mediator dealer was ??   His son was .
5013 2018-08-18 19:38:07 Oh!!! Didn't think about the coconut oil...yeah, that'd work fine!
5014 2018-08-18 19:37:55 BY extracting energy OUT of the climate itself. The more energy you produce now the less you will have access to later. Its just less unsustainable than oil.

This still isn't a defense of Wall St, who kept these developments from happening for decades. They're evil.
5015 2018-08-18 19:37:41 Alberta gov't current ads are a lie to the country. State pipeline will secure Canadas future and bringing funding to renewable sources of energy. Liars! Who will buy the oil in the future.. China made deal with Russia. EU cutting fossil fuels over next 10 yrs... not 30yrs.. 10.

5026 2018-08-18 19:36:00 The year is 2018, a single man  in his early 30s is struggling in a desperate pursuit to find any real meaning or identity in his life:

-“love my new mossimo supply co. henly t shirt”

5032 2018-08-18 19:35:28 Waited in line for 3 hours to get an oil change, and it took the maintenance guy only 10 minutes to do it. @Walmart why y’all do me like this?

5039 2018-08-18 19:34:47 The Alberta gov't has lowered the rate of tax they collect from oil to a fraction of what it was during the days of Lougheed. The oil companies have controlled of the gov't . I know from living in Alberta for 18 years... Northern Alberta will be polluted for the next 100 years.
5040 2018-08-18 19:34:37 Kofi Annan's UN legacy was one of corruption (Oil-for-Food), mismanagement and failure. 
He presided over the Congo UN peacekeeping scandal where peacekeepers prostituted out women and young girls. He never apologized for that, btw.

5045 2018-08-18 19:34:17 Kofi Annan is a statesman, Africa's best diplomat to hold the UNSG with a mixed legacy : (1) ignored intervention that could've prevented Rwandan Genocide & (2) lapse in judgment on conflict of interest involving his Son's employer in Iraq's food for oil. Yet, RIP to a big man.

5054 2018-08-18 19:32:52 haven't modeled but combo of higher USD oil prices and fall in USD GDP = big rise in oil import bill v GDP I assume.   agree non-oil balance should adjust quickly (expect a pretty severe demand fall even without rate hikes from fx balance sheet effects and credit curbs)
5055 2018-08-18 19:32:50 I can call my dad on any given day, at any given time and he will not answer. I could text him that I'm being held hostage and he'll call me 3 days later talking bout "so what happened?". Swear old ppl and phones are like oil and water. They do not mix

5061 2018-08-18 19:32:24 Roasties are piss easy. Parboil, drain, leave to steam dry in the pot. Preheat the oil in the oven. Rumble the potatoes, coat in hot oil, bung in oven.

5066 2018-08-18 19:31:38 Thank you, couldn’t have said it better, It is an iron rule of history that what looks inevitable in hindsight was far from obvious at the time. In 2014 some of us saw the indicators, with US - our erstwhile biggest buyer crude oil pulling out to produce their own shale...
5067 2018-08-18 19:31:30 Yeah, what a burden this would put on oil companies and gas filling stations but progress is change and change is for the better.

5072 2018-08-18 19:30:37 true. but if crypto behaves like crude oil because its become a crowded trade, these names will need real interest and a rounded bottom to move back up.  sadly is there even a fundamental case for crypto or is it just another tradeable asset class?

5075 2018-08-18 19:30:19 @vicenews did a piece showing a pipeline cutting through this lady's property. LA has such lax laws as a state oil and gas can do whatever they want because of "jobs". They use eminent domain to take land paying pennies on the dollar, ruin it and you can't sue to fix damages.

5088 2018-08-18 19:28:35 They need to change the oil too...
5089 2018-08-18 19:28:33 I challenge any Importer of Rice, Toothpicks, Toilet Papers, Junks, Tomatoes, Palm oil, Gari, Fake Drugs to love @MBuhari. It's Impossible. But the Creative Artisans, Farmers who are in de Majority Loves him. No more dumping in Naija. @APCUKingdom @APCNigeria @Mr_JAGs
5090 2018-08-18 19:28:26 I ran out of THC oil, so I've been smoking plain CBD on it's own. Yea, CBD by itself doesn't get you "stoned", but it def does help with anxiety and keeping calm, motivation, and largely helps with sleep lol 
5091 2018-08-18 19:28:23 Massage today! YAY!!!!! My neck need it fo sho. 
#massagethearpy #neck #nice #gettingamassage #oil #table #yummy #need
5092 2018-08-18 19:28:20 These people and my people have been consistently dismissed as “collateral damage”. Collateral for what exactly? The oil and arms industry, imperialist capitalism, or just lazy bloody mindedness?
5093 2018-08-18 19:28:19 I saw avocado ice cream and avocado oil  is something
5094 2018-08-18 19:28:11 Hello friends! I am looking for recommendations for a good light/med coverage foundation/bb cream that helps with oil control/ is good for acne prone skin! comment ur faves pls!!
5095 2018-08-18 19:27:56 For real? 
Not a boycotter by nature and dont expect ppl to give up things making life easier or more enjoyable. But, I have had it with leftists winning the culture war in this country, ignorantly destroying structure that gave them a platform and wealth
5096 2018-08-18 19:27:50 They’re the worst! I use a cleansing oil because coconut oil breaks me out 
5097 2018-08-18 19:27:47 uhhh, mcfukkin dry shampoo might help with the oil at least
5098 2018-08-18 19:27:42 be as kind to yourself as you would be to other people. Also, CBD oil. Also, cat videos. Also, cat(s). 
5099 2018-08-18 19:27:32 Johnson’s Baby Oil is surpringly free of babies and johnsons.
5100 2018-08-18 19:27:20 I like to use olive oil to give me that skeleton wet look, fry lite if I'm on a diet.
5101 2018-08-18 19:26:54 If I'm right, we'll be like a car with no engine oil. Coutinho would have provided that 'oil'. Rakitic and Roberto together in midfield + Suarez wasting minimal chances created is just friction.
5102 2018-08-18 19:26:52 Oil Spill flyer looking like straight cocaine
5103 2018-08-18 19:26:52 Except that Norway supports their social programs with capitalism, and in particular, oil revenue. Can we put you down as supporting "Drill baby drill"?
5104 2018-08-18 19:26:47 Look to Ethiopia and Egypt. Look to Israel, Jordan and Iraq. Water is the new oil. Those countries have real reasons to worry. Here, it is more about proper harvesting. The abundance of rainfall and the many rivers should be enough to keep us going.
5105 2018-08-18 19:26:46 By doing it this way, my hair doesn't get too oily either. I live in 106 degree weather and that oil and sweat is not good for my already oily face lol
5106 2018-08-18 19:26:42 Oh no! I 've had shingles and it's miserable. The only thing I found to help was to dilute some eculyptus oil in warm water and dab on the areas with cotton ball. Or bath with oil. Try cotton first to avoid possible reaction.Hope you feel better soon!!!
5107 2018-08-18 19:26:37 15W40 recommended for a hydrostat? That’s engine oil. Engine oil is typically mineral, & a no-no for o-rings and hydraulic components.
5108 2018-08-18 19:26:34 WHAT CAUSED KERALA FLOODS:
1. Christians? No.

3. Communists? No.
4. Women's entry - Sabarimalai? No.
5. Beef eating? No.
6. Being mallu? No.
7. Winking girls? No. 
8. Excessive use coconut oil? No. 
9. Lots of rain? Yes.

Please donate to relief efforts. 
5109 2018-08-18 19:26:19 I used olive oil and it feels gross and didnt really work. So now im just oily and makeupy
5110 2018-08-18 19:26:15 China removes 25% tariff on oil. America has become too big too ignore in the oil industry. Add another win for Trump
5111 2018-08-18 19:26:11 Oil change, so boring - tire rotation, ugh. Take care of the things you love and they take care of you  so money well spent. #idislikecars
5112 2018-08-18 19:25:53 “Let a righteous man strike me —- it is a kindness; let him rebuke me —- it is oil for my head; let my head not refuse it. Yet my prayer is continually against their evil deeds.” Psalm 141:5
5113 2018-08-18 19:25:49 America was "great" because it was the only country left standing after WWII. Because of that, we dominated trade in practically everything: agriculture, vehicles, machinery&tools, oil, banking, comms, aircraft.... That could not last forever. Now we have to compete.

5115 2018-08-18 19:25:42 Don’t want to knee jerk but Robinson is an absolute gob shite and I want him nowhere near the team. He’s selling snake oil. Not a fan and he has no idea how to fix this #OUFC #COYY
5116 2018-08-18 19:25:35 Tried some CBD oil. I guess I was already relaxed. Didn’t feel a difference. I’ll have to up the dosage to 420 next time.
5117 2018-08-18 19:25:32 11. Don’t eat an hour or two before sucking dick, you’ll gag more.

12. Want a Smooth ? Brown Suger and coconut oil 

13. Make sure to have a back up plan, have extra money for “Plan B” (shit happens)
5118 2018-08-18 19:25:31 Smoking palm oil is top 5 scariest things 
5119 2018-08-18 19:25:28 เดมมั้ย
5120 2018-08-18 19:25:26 Duo clearly haven't 'forgiven' him. The message they are sending places Daktari in a huger scandal than 2004's    'Oil for food'.
5121 2018-08-18 19:25:15 Rosehip oil mixed in with your moisturizer after you wash your face.
5122 2018-08-18 19:25:05 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
5123 2018-08-18 19:25:05 This is also like saying “Most of the men who fought in Iraq dont have large investments in oil.” It was fought for the State’s rights to OWN SLAVES. That State’s Rights bullshit is a played out excuse that every racist uses to justify their opinion about the South, or whatever.
5124 2018-08-18 19:24:58 If Stalin wanted to fight the Nazis why was he supplying them with oil and allowing the Heer to mount training operations on Russian territory? Stalin helped the Nazis. Partition of Poland? Non-aggression pact?
5125 2018-08-18 19:24:47 A Question thread to @ncbn @JaiTDP @naralokesh 
1. do you know that there is very huge mafia is happening in the rajahmundry and kakinada constituency by making the theft of the oil of ONGC and the employes are also beong silent there 
What say?
5126 2018-08-18 19:24:42 Using technology that was made by someone you then call out isnt hypocritical. Thats like when ppl called out Jill Stein for her 401k in oil corps instead of a green company. Hypocrisy would be her investing in oil, not taking money from it & calling to attn: what needs to change
5127 2018-08-18 19:24:25 - Try aloe vera. You can cut and extract the gel from the leaf and make your own gel. On the internet you will find methods. But you can also find specialized stores.
- Coconut oil which contains Vitamin E and regenerative properties can also help you a lot.
5128 2018-08-18 19:24:08 Auntie- what kindve oil you used? You mixed it?

Me- No I bought it from the hair store

Mama- yeah I tried that on my scalp it had me itchy, all them oils make my scalp itchy 

Me- you just dirty 

Mama- yo mouth dirty 

LMAOOOO I’m over this lady
5129 2018-08-18 19:24:06 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
5130 2018-08-18 19:23:53 This is the U.S oil reserves ?
5131 2018-08-18 19:23:47 I know I don't have the same ailments as you, but I get shakes (& I'm sure they won't be anywhere near as severe as yours) but vaping CBD oil with my MediPen helps mine, I wonder if it would benefit yours at all! Just an idea if you know anyone who has some to try xxxx
5132 2018-08-18 19:23:42 Why does it take a car dealership more than an hour to change my oil WHEN an appt was made ? Why are people getting up before me WHEN they got here after me ?
5133 2018-08-18 19:23:42 @jvn I have a question RE a DIY facial scrub, if you have a sec? 
Can I add olive oil to a honey and oats scrub? I have a dry T-zone :)
5134 2018-08-18 19:23:34 Baby oil.  Scam..
5135 2018-08-18 19:23:26 I got a haircut and oil change today and ordered a new cabin filter.  I feel like a productive member of society

/plays video games the rest of the day
5136 2018-08-18 19:23:21 Imagine coming home from work  & your gowns full of fucken cooking oil. I'm so pissed
5137 2018-08-18 19:22:28 Oh my God, I was saying the exact same thing to my friend yesterday traveling from Lokoja to Abuja. Have you taken a look at the rivee bank as well? So beautiful. Tourism alone can boost our economy in a huge way but our government wants to die on top of oil
5138 2018-08-18 19:22:07 Amazing is what it is. Chocolate candy that looks like weed in the bowl and hes using a electronically heated slide that can smoke oil and regular bud. Wow
5139 2018-08-18 19:21:55 @enterprisecares Paying customer gets a car that is leaking oil wants a new car, denied to get one and speak racial slurs to them as well. Last time I checked 'white trash' is not acceptable language! And um I'm not white either but my husband is.... #leftwithnocar #leavingtoday
5140 2018-08-18 19:21:50 U blame PMB for recession but it started in 2014 
@NOIweala blamed it on the decline in oil revenue in late 2014, which accounted for 50 per cent cut in the total federally collectible revenue as well as the low revenue receipts from non-oil sources
5141 2018-08-18 19:21:49 China removed the 25% Tariff on USA Oil.
Why isn't the Media talking about this? #WINNING !!
5142 2018-08-18 19:21:26 From The Day I Saw You I Knew I found Oil Baby Girl You Royal Am Gon Be Loyal
5143 2018-08-18 19:21:23 Frfr if someone needs an oil change and has the stuff for it I'll probably do it for like $5ish dollars idc lol
5144 2018-08-18 19:21:21 i burned my foot with hot oil lol
5145 2018-08-18 19:21:13 ใจเย็นนะ อยากเล่ามั้ย
5146 2018-08-18 19:21:11 Alright just checking. Be safe. Congrats on your first oil change!
5147 2018-08-18 19:20:56 Instead of washing my face when it gets greasy, I wash my hands and then start rubbing my nails on my forehead as like an extremely DIY nail oil treatment. I am Getting Into Beauty but will not abandon my crusty ways.
5148 2018-08-18 19:20:39 Now a days all most all government oil company's are not taking site lease agreement with dealers but this company is taking by force . Dealer is the site owner and dealer is invested his own money than why company take lease agreement
5149 2018-08-18 19:20:35 6.Shave with coconut oil Or conditioner 

7. ALWAYS ALWAYS pee After sex! 

8.Drink water before sucking dick, your throat is less dry.

9.Use throat numbing Spray if it’s your first time.

10. Scrub all dead skin off with brown suger and olive oil.
5150 2018-08-18 19:20:35 Another explanation for the Fermi Paradox: While intelligent life may be widespread in the galaxy, oil probably isn’t.
5151 2018-08-18 19:19:46 It takes about 20K to fill up the tank of an airplane with jet fuel . With that kind of business my guess is that dependence on oil is here to stay .
5152 2018-08-18 19:19:35 A better analysis would be to factor in productivity gains into the IEAE analysis through waterfall chart, plus look at at a basket of indicators like # of wells drilled, employment, and oil output.
5153 2018-08-18 19:19:29 Bio oil too
5154 2018-08-18 19:19:17 ร้องไห้ทำไม
5155 2018-08-18 19:19:17 10/10 right! I use the tarte maracuja oil and its great
5156 2018-08-18 19:19:07 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
5157 2018-08-18 19:19:05 Θέλω να καθαρίσω κάτι αυτοκόλλητα από τα έπιπλα του γιου μου, μου είπαν να χρησιμοποιήσω μαγιονέζα... Λέτε να κάνει και το baby oil ή είναι μόνο για τα μουσεία  – έχει σαρκαστική διάθεση
5158 2018-08-18 19:19:04 There is about to be a HUGE crash of oil assets, the wells are already drying up which is why we need fracking in the first place. How many barrels of oil are you guys burning to get 1 barrel of oil out of these pits??
5159 2018-08-18 19:19:03 So many attempts to mix water and oil there

5162 2018-08-18 19:18:39 I made my dad wake up and schedule my inspection and oil change bc i still refuse to do adult things hehe
5163 2018-08-18 19:18:31 It's a function of progressivism. One step no matter how far, can never be enough. No matter what the issue, what they claim to want at the moment will never satisfy them. 
Progress MUST continue at all cost, BAMN,  if only for sake of " progress," alone.
5164 2018-08-18 19:18:30 The amount of oil on my face could drown the employers that won’t give me a job because I need 22 years of experience to be an intern.
5165 2018-08-18 19:18:29 nothing makes me want to rely on public transportation like spending $500 at a routine oil change.
5166 2018-08-18 19:18:10 I saw her. Even offered groundnuts and palm oil sef.
5167 2018-08-18 19:18:01 we dont have any makeup remover and i rly dont wanna put cooking oil on my face what do
5168 2018-08-18 19:17:58 I'll just wait for actual evidence. None of this "points to" or "read through", subjective nonsense.

POTUS destroyed a Russian Battalion in Syria and is waging a financial war with Russia's REAL ally, Iran. He also called out Germany's secret oil deal with Putin. Go back to CNN.
5169 2018-08-18 19:17:14 @andrew_leach tweet doesn’t account for the 20% cost reduction in the global oil field service sector achieved through the automation efforts of Exxon, Pason, SLB, and Baker Hughes. Energy companies are not investing in Wildcat wells that have low probability of success.
5170 2018-08-18 19:17:13 3 table spoons of Castor Oil when you wake up. No drinking or eating for a good 3 hours. It will cleanse you. Be sure to do it on a day you don't have to leave the house or are receiving people though
5171 2018-08-18 19:17:10 Saturated Fats are also found in a few vegetable oils, such as palm oil, coconut oil, hydrogenated oils, and chocolate. Heart Health
5172 2018-08-18 19:16:59 "Oil doh spoil but it spoiled a country"
5173 2018-08-18 19:16:54 Incase anyone was wondering it totally helps. So ditch the peppermint oil and go straight to the biofreeze. It’s like peppermint oil on crack.
5174 2018-08-18 19:16:51 New wedges certainly make a different. I change mine every couple of years. With Links turf I can nip the ball very cleanly and can do the one hop stop shot. Then again I have a 64° oil can Vokey in my bag that I can pick off a car park. #cleanasacucumber

5182 2018-08-18 19:15:55 Was watching this in a cafe (with headphones) and was literally laughing out loud at that bit around the 4 min mark. "Go sell some medicine, bitches. Trying to get that oil" That throat clear.
5183 2018-08-18 19:15:49 I'd say keep it, but it needs neatsfoot oil STAT

5186 2018-08-18 19:15:43 Hit the dispensary and copped a half of gas and a gram of oil all for 48$
Reason why I don’t get it in the streets.
5187 2018-08-18 19:15:35 Waiting around at the speed of ground.  Got nowhere to go, till my oil change is done tho.
5188 2018-08-18 19:15:32 Lol yo ima just start changing my own oil this shit stupid
5189 2018-08-18 19:15:13 It also doesn’t describe the mixture made as a potion and the make up of the “potion” is made form natural things so it would be more of a natural oil not a potion.
5190 2018-08-18 19:15:10 Maybe Canada can provide antibiotics and WiFi in exchange for the Cuban snake oil  “cancer vaccine” other guy posted to claim Cuba has meds. When you live in old Havana for weeks, antibiotics are like gold .  People make garlic remedies because they can’t get meds.
5191 2018-08-18 19:14:52 You look like coconut oil mixed with the blood of Jesus Christ b.
5192 2018-08-18 19:14:51 It's  palm oil that has been passed thru over 1000° heat
5193 2018-08-18 19:14:36 Saves u bread. I got a vape pen I gotta get some thc oil
5194 2018-08-18 19:14:30 Salt I understand, some people add it.But oil???in water? who does that? 
5195 2018-08-18 19:14:29 some things that worked 4 me is only combing it out in the shower, then while wet separate and moisturize in sections, I like Shea Butter products but products mixed with Jamaican castor oil promotes growth. Also trimming dead ends
5196 2018-08-18 19:14:26 In the oven pls...but in shape of fried potatos with olive oil and a lil bit basil

5198 2018-08-18 19:14:24 Nothing like needing a breaker bar.  to get the drain plug loose to change oil

5203 2018-08-18 19:13:50 They are trying, and we have to get it back to the better foot.  Exxon and elements in Guyana have been trying to keep things quiet.  Guyana needs more scrutiny from outside, and the issues around oil need to be publicized internationally.
5204 2018-08-18 19:13:48 # @realdonaldtrump  Justin Trudeau suckers donald trump with the purchase of the US Company Transmountain Pipeline, could now stop flow of oil into USA!
5205 2018-08-18 19:13:46 That stuff is too concentrated at that time same with the honey oil made me choke to death LOL but those were the good old days nice to be able to smoke at a concert now you can't do that
5206 2018-08-18 19:13:16 Snagged some from Lori’s and got a couple scents to put in the almond oil. It’s currently in my beard but there’s no one around to tell me if it smells good.

5208 2018-08-18 19:13:05 This is no joke, my younger brother favourite food is white yam and red oil, this nigga was born and brought up in Lagos and still in Lagos not village, how come?
5209 2018-08-18 19:13:03 I’m sorry for his loved ones but may I ask what exactly he achieved? He did watch the murder of upwards 800,000 in Rwanda by his lack of action (though he alone was not responsible). The Food for Oil scandal was also bad.

5212 2018-08-18 19:12:31 The actual risks of continued reliance on cars and oil 
are wars, death to oceans, tragic vehicular deaths and 
injuries worldwide. These deaths will be a leading 
cause of all dying. Most victims will be invisible, 
poor, ignored. They never show up in seductive car ads.
5213 2018-08-18 19:12:23 Sincerely hope rational critical thinking Americans see this hyperbolic rhetoric, anger, hatred for what it really is. 
These ppl no different in nature than those at the top of Maduro regime regardless of any other comparison of econ, ect.

5214 2018-08-18 19:12:21 @bengbenro asked @BBoason a vital question
"In what ways could appointment of ministers have increased oil earning & ensure availability of $ & confidence that investors can repatriate their money? I am really interested in learning"
I am perching here hoping to learn too
5215 2018-08-18 19:12:10 7ozs soy creamer, 1oz apple cider vinegar for vegan buttermilk & I basted the tops with olive oil, minced garlic & dusted it with parm. The housemate has blamed me for making him fat. Try not eating all of it, duh.
5216 2018-08-18 19:12:07 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5217 2018-08-18 19:12:05 The glory burning off our anointing oil is the light of life. 
5218 2018-08-18 19:11:47 Lucas Oil is so nice tho. One time I went to a high school state championship game just to be in the building.
5219 2018-08-18 19:11:47 wait what?! kanti dont you put in the seeds and oil at the same time ?
5220 2018-08-18 19:11:43 I hate coming to get my oil change cause it takes forever , it’s always hella cold in the waiting area.. and to top it off men always try to pick up conversations with me .... sir I’m not into Men lol then they be like cool me either #bye #readytogo #letmelive
5221 2018-08-18 19:11:43 Actually Jimmy Carter was decades ahead of his time, and too honest for corrupt DC & corporate media. Big oil & the military industrial complex sabotaged him, and even tried to destroy his presidency.
5222 2018-08-18 19:11:39 Por puerto de Yabucoa entra la gasolina que ya no se produce aquí, y la infraestructura de desembarco sería una alternativa más los terrenos que ocupó la antigua refinería Sun Oil, Shell. Hay que tener diferentes plantas generadoras en diferentes puntos de la 
5223 2018-08-18 19:11:29 We're talking about someone who's advocated for war after war that has caused the deaths of at least a few million innocent civilians, to say nothing of the thousands of dead U.S. service members, all for oil and resources. Yeah that guy should die, wish it wasn't cancer though.
5224 2018-08-18 19:11:25 I just signed the petition asking @msimanchester to drop dirty oil company @shell as a sponser. Trying to sanitize their misdeeds
5225 2018-08-18 19:11:24 Oil change - 1st tine on this SUV 
5226 2018-08-18 19:11:09 Oil money rich, they don't have no fans, city the oil club
5227 2018-08-18 19:10:58 it's funny how the very laws designed to keep people from consuming snake oil as medicine are now pricing real medications so far out of the market snake oils are proliferating again.
5228 2018-08-18 19:10:53 try portiaM products.They is morula oil in there i heard it really works
5229 2018-08-18 19:10:52 I guess I’d rather just reduce drilling (or tax consumption) rather than allow unlimited production and then try to choke point oil transportation. Seems like a weird part of the process to focus on.
5230 2018-08-18 19:10:52 Gaskiya it necessary, Walahi I miss sokoto life. I have like 5-6 favorite joints
5231 2018-08-18 19:10:44 with money from Niger Delta oil and Niger Delta youths are still jobless.
5232 2018-08-18 19:10:31 Yes majority! Nobody agrees with schools being blown up or massive oil deals. Your average citizen does not agree with US foreign policy especially if they all knew the truth
5233 2018-08-18 19:10:17 Το αρχικό σου τουιτ νόμιζα οτι το έγραψες για το baby oil με το οποίο πασάλειψαν εκθέματα του Βυζαντινού Μουσείου δύο τρελές και τώρα βγήκε στη φόρα .
5234 2018-08-18 19:10:08 23 VMRS Modifieds at The New London Waterford Speedbowl, Keith Rocco was fastest in the first practice followed by Dave Schneider. Max Zachem got a hole in the oil pan and is done for the day.
5235 2018-08-18 19:10:05 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
5236 2018-08-18 19:10:00 When I first went natural it was struggle city. There was literally no real info geared toward 4c hair other than the Naptural boards where everyone swore coconut oil and shea butter were the answers (they weren't for me). Now I'm relearning how to be natural all over again.
5237 2018-08-18 19:10:00 Aren’t you forgetting your oil plays from last year?

5239 2018-08-18 19:09:47 Well said Jim!! The weapon and oil industry have destroyed the Middle East!
5240 2018-08-18 19:09:47 #Irumbuthirai பாத்தாச்சு. செம படம். ஏன் அதிகம் பேசப்படலன்னு தெரியல. ஸ்டோரி தான் ஹைலைட். 

Information is wealth and Data is new oil - இதான் கதை கரு.

5241 2018-08-18 19:09:34 ... some have been lucky with oil,  otherwise they would all be like Pakistan and India,  where it’s common place to take a ‘dump’ anywhere, as seen on #marr documentary a few years ago.
5242 2018-08-18 19:09:30 I didn’t know that you could get different types of olive oil.
5243 2018-08-18 19:09:21 Haba  we are going for a tour one of this days gaskiya
5244 2018-08-18 19:09:16 Activate telling them I use CBD or hemp oil supplements and so might test positive beast mode
5245 2018-08-18 19:09:05 Guess i was 2weeks late to change the oil
5246 2018-08-18 19:08:39 I’ve been at Nissan for 2 hours! Just to get a new key, a new battery for my old key and to put my plates on... #wtf oil changes don’t take as long!
5247 2018-08-18 19:08:33 Fucking #Koningshuis En die @PietervVol maa mooi weer spelen. Ze zitten tot hun nek in de drugs, OIL, witwaspraktijken en verdere corruptie. Deals met SA en Maffia Italië..Ze gaan ten onder, dat zweer ik.
5248 2018-08-18 19:08:33 Shower, don’t bathe. My eczema always gets worse when I take a bath. Cetaphil is my go to for cleansing and soothing. Consider a fish oil supplement. Ice packs cut the itching so you don’t scratch and reduce swelling and irritation.
5249 2018-08-18 19:08:30 I read on the back of the Pumpkin Falafel sandwich pack this week that one of the ingredients was palm oil. I can’t find any ingredients list online however?
5250 2018-08-18 19:08:28 All I want is an oil change
5251 2018-08-18 19:08:18 "What? Oil? Huh? Who said something about oil? Bitch are you cooking?"
5252 2018-08-18 19:08:07 Denmark is not an oil country.  A large country has economies of scale.  If you want a few watermelons, plant an area the size of a bedroom.  If you want a million watermelons, get a 16 row tractor and plant a couple of sections.
5253 2018-08-18 19:08:00 I go out and mow the lawn and come back to find out that STP(which is a gooey engine oil additive) can't seem to play well with others. On that note i think I will mute this string as I watch him spin out. Have a great day Michele
5254 2018-08-18 19:07:52 like men go fast strike oil    sleep
5255 2018-08-18 19:07:46 Trump and the Russian oligarchs have already done an oil deal (In Helsinki?). US citizens will pay more for all energy sources, while the billionaires get richer.
5256 2018-08-18 19:07:44 lmk when you need an oil change and i’ll let you know when i need you to read some contracts or some shit
5257 2018-08-18 19:07:36 Easier to just look at the entities Trump has NOT started a Twitter War with.

Putin
Duterte
Nazis
El Sisi 
NRA
Mercers 
Adelson
The “Trump Accountant”
Nunes
Oil Companies
Tom Barrack
Hannity
Tucker
Laura
The three old white dudes who secretly run the VA from Mar A Lago.
5258 2018-08-18 19:06:49 Oil changed, Kiddo's school supplies acquired, school clothes for Kidlet and some for Kiddo acquired, mediocre BBQ place discovered (Mission was underwhelming at best), and I think my debit card melted.
5259 2018-08-18 19:06:42 So much better after that oil change
5260 2018-08-18 19:06:34 I’ve seen big oil companies use Mercs from G4s I don’t know how often the govt uses or if they use them
5261 2018-08-18 19:06:09 Republicans are notorious for deploying troops to fight for the profit of MIC, defense contracts to their friends, big oil and the profit of the POTUS.. it’s quite disgusting.. then when the troops come home they forget what they’ve done for them and do not take care of them
5262 2018-08-18 19:06:02 You are both wrong. Natural Gas, Oil & Coal are all the most valuable resources that Mother Earth has provided us. It would be immoral to not fully utilize them to ensure a successful centuries long transition to energy systems more reliable than wind & solar.
5263 2018-08-18 19:05:56 Cleaned the car out, got it washed, engine flushed, oil changed, finishing laundry, grocery shopping. On an adulting roll today
5264 2018-08-18 19:05:47 What’s a bread that goes well with olive oil and Skippy’s Chunky Peanut Butter? Not both at the same time, those are just the only condiments I have in my kitchen
5265 2018-08-18 19:05:43 Oh yea, I know, they do jobs Americans won't do and can't live on, yet somehow 2 million, give or take are alive, thriving and sending kids, A LOT of them, to our schools. 
Which I then get to make up the deficit they dont pay
5266 2018-08-18 19:05:32 My favorite medium is pen and ink. Possibly oil pastel. I like shit messy.
5267 2018-08-18 19:05:21 Grandma: I'll lend you my oil for the sewing machine, be careful with it because it was shipped to me from D.R. years ago.
Me: oh wow okay- thanks.
*gma hands me the oil*
Me: wait this is 3 in 1 lol you can find this anywhere.
Grandma: HOW DARE YOU SHAME MY PRECIOUS OIL.
5268 2018-08-18 19:05:15 Ik wil jullie (Peter en Peter) alvast bedanken voor deze eye opener. 
T lijkt (IS) net als US allemaal zo corrupt door drugs money oil dat de hele wereld verrot is op t bot. 
Ik ga morgen alles lezen en heb nog andere dingen te lezen.. want nu wil ik echt alles weten.
5269 2018-08-18 19:05:12 I used to think I didn't like the smell of Frankincense, then I got the essential oil and realized it had a beautiful effect which bypassed what my mind thinks of the smell.
5270 2018-08-18 19:05:09 Haba Amina, I spent 4 years plus. 
5271 2018-08-18 19:05:09 Hi sister! They do really hurt and you can get rid of them faster with peppermint oil. I used to get them ALL the time when I was little, it really helps. Put a lil bit on the sister sore, let it dry, and do that about 3-5 time a day until it's gone hopefully this helps lol
5272 2018-08-18 19:05:03 Indeed. Why we complain (and rightly so) about situation of gay people in Russia while in Saudi Arabia gays are killed or put in prison. Still we buy oil from Saudi Arabia. And gas from Qatar.
5273 2018-08-18 19:04:59 also pro-tip for basically anyone something that’s really good after you shave the downtown is unite’s Uoil it’s 100% argan oil. it’s kind of pricey but better than razor burn!
5274 2018-08-18 19:04:12 Quick reminder that Trudeau's Libs spent Canadian tax dollars buying out a Texan oil pipeline so they could ram it through a province that voted for a prov. government adamantly opposed to it, a province that is in a state of emergency b/c everything is literally on fire.
5275 2018-08-18 19:04:08 Oil
5276 2018-08-18 19:04:07 Idk whats better, coming home all dirty from oil/grease or sawdust 
5277 2018-08-18 19:03:57 Sarwa You know all the joints ooo 
5278 2018-08-18 19:03:50 I would eat a salad consisting of chicken breast, barely steamed broccoli, raw red pepper and red onion with oil & vinegar dressing.
5279 2018-08-18 19:03:46 Going to try and stream today and I won't be able to do a video a day oil try to buy when ever I upload i upload
5280 2018-08-18 19:03:42 A little oil painting fun to stretch the brain...
5281 2018-08-18 19:03:41 What is great about this shot is the way it highlights the choke point of the Malacca Straits. That is also the main arterial for China’s oil imports. On so many fronts it highlights China’s vulnerabilities. Plonk an American carrier there and how long does China tick on for?
5282 2018-08-18 19:03:17 Unfortunately, that’s exactly the kind of false choice scenario the fossil fuel industry wants us to stay trapped in. All the options for transporting oil are dangerous.
5283 2018-08-18 19:03:16 It is true that the West favors the government of centuries old Power who happen to be Sunni. Their motivation is Security. Peace is essential to Trade, and Saudi Arabia is being subtly attacked by Iran efforts to depose the Saudi king and take his oil.
5284 2018-08-18 19:02:55 first: a real nasty oil leak
second: zero brakes
might be time for a new car
5285 2018-08-18 19:02:42 Hmmmm.  An aluminum oil container with ribs?
5286 2018-08-18 19:02:41 Little gremlins getting to @WorshamAndFink this weekend. One more shot to get off the bump. You got this @delworsham @CPCARRILLO @Lucas_Oil @ToyotaRacing

5289 2018-08-18 19:02:20 So at @kfc I bought myself a all star lunch box and requested a side breast as my choice of chicken and I receive an oily piece of slimy thigh with enough oil to fry a few eggs. Also I received a coke when I asked for sprite and it was flat and warm... wtf ?
5290 2018-08-18 19:02:05 ياجبان اتحداك تكون في وسط الجماهير السعوديه من دون الجاكيت اللي مخبي التي شيرت هههههههههههههههه وربي لايخلونك مجروش وهريس

5292 2018-08-18 19:02:00 Last time I checked over half the budget was dedicated to education. 
Avg starting pay for teachers around $50,000, 180 days. Benefits? 
How much is this "living wage?"
Poor children? How many do we have belong to illegals working for below "American wages?"
5293 2018-08-18 19:01:35 Anyways all I do is use black African soap and face stuff from muddy body with the oil
5294 2018-08-18 19:01:08 I would hope so. I did not even know how to check my oil until the army showed me, lol.
5295 2018-08-18 19:01:05 “We own a steel mill in Cleveland, shipping in Texas, oil refineries in Seattle, and a factory in Chicago that makes miniature models of factories.”
5296 2018-08-18 19:01:05 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
5297 2018-08-18 19:01:04 Hell yeah, that's well worth it.

Toward the end my civic burned some oil but that car was a tank. Took it down to Florida for spring break and it performed like a champ all the way from MD down and back.
5298 2018-08-18 19:01:02 @RepRyanZinke you are an evil bastard who has no respect for the people you serve your answer to everything is hunt/kill/destroy you do not care about the rights ordinary people just big business oil and gas/coal profits i have no respect for you
5299 2018-08-18 19:01:02 Russia is faring well when Oil prices rise. 
Interesting dynamic.
5300 2018-08-18 19:00:25 Wondering how many times people get an oil change at their dealership but they also get their shocks replaced with old or substandard shocks.
5301 2018-08-18 19:00:25 What Trump has done is to give Russia what it wanted. Higher oil prices. He is giving Saudi Arabia what they want - blocking Their fiercest enemy. Nothing would make Saudi’s happier than us fighting Iran fie them.
5302 2018-08-18 19:00:23 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
5303 2018-08-18 18:59:57 Bless God sir... how’s the oil and gas industry?
5304 2018-08-18 18:59:54 It’s gonna be different with every dude but if he only does something for you when there’s a chance of sex being reciprocated then he just fuckin. Some dudes slicker than a can of oil tho so he can fake a whole relationship 
5305 2018-08-18 18:59:48 Keep that energy when he goes to maralagos
5306 2018-08-18 18:59:47 Oh but that wouldn’t be a hoagie, imo. A hoagie has ham, salami, provolone, onion, tomato, lettuce, and the bread is *soaked* in oil and vinegar. You can’t have a roast beef hoagie. But maybe the term “grinder” is more inclusive
5307 2018-08-18 18:59:44 Cbd oil did tons for my anxiety and it’s definitely something that I would recommend but yeah definitely go to our doctor first just in case. Whatever you do though don’t take Xanax that shit will fuck you up
5308 2018-08-18 18:59:34 Hot and fresh oil! Come and get it! We’ve got loose gravel and caution rocks too!
5309 2018-08-18 18:59:18 When next he’s coming back, tell him to buy from low cost wajen roundabout
5310 2018-08-18 18:59:18 I love balsamic vinegar but would just buy a generally good quality one, not a Jamie Oliver one. Bought some today on holiday and went for the own brand. Just had with olive oil, salt and local bread.. yum!
5311 2018-08-18 18:59:12 Riiight. She probably asked them to use lard instead of vegetable oil to cook his fries & switch to 70/30 hamburger meat.
5312 2018-08-18 18:58:56 No, they don't. Better for freedom on election day.
5313 2018-08-18 18:58:47 Lmao idc if they use separate oil that much.
5314 2018-08-18 18:58:19 Could you adjust it for the oil price headwind during UPA times? 
5315 2018-08-18 18:58:09 Lol my gateman is from sokoto ,he supplies it when he's coming back home,but since dad was advice's about Lafiya's kilishi d story changed
5316 2018-08-18 18:57:52 Isn’t there also a public safety case for not moving oil over old train tracks through small towns? That’s been a disaster waiting to happen. If blocking pipelines just shifts oil transport to more dangerous means, I could see an argument for allowing them.
5317 2018-08-18 18:57:38 She wanted to go to this other place. Bareburger maybe idr. But I’ve had the mushroom burger that’s actually good but it’s just deep fried shit and let’s be honest they probably not using separate oil 
5318 2018-08-18 18:57:27 Petrol  quality also depends on the pump station. Indian oil and BP are good. Reliance too.

5324 2018-08-18 18:56:58 Been getting a great feeling about this season since Jose, started speaking good of his Team and fans support. all we need now for the players to be more clinical on the pitch and i`m sure we can give those  wanna be Manchester is blue , a run for there oil money @markgoldbridge
5325 2018-08-18 18:56:42 How will government of India manage rapid sky high INFLATION of articles,  food, vegetables,  oil, fuel   medicines, medical treatments and education during and after flood in Kerala? No plan to check it out as yet, I think so.
5326 2018-08-18 18:56:40 As long as Iran doesn’t return to the exploitation of corrupt rulers and foreign powers plundering its oil.
5327 2018-08-18 18:56:37 And you think policy response to the sudden decline in revenues did not lead to the recession? Six months of no policy direction and poor economic choices could only lead to one consequence. Have we wondered why growth still remains below 2% despite the pick up in oil prices?
5328 2018-08-18 18:55:53 I’m very impulsive, have anxiety, depression, and trust issues for years, I finally started takin care of the anxiety a couple years back but this year I decided I didn’t want to rely on medication to feel ok. So I’ve been vaping oil and it’s the best thing I could’ve done.
5329 2018-08-18 18:55:37 At least an education on an oil change if he's not willing to get an electric mower....
5330 2018-08-18 18:55:30 What do you mean act,send another generation of young soldiers my son include ,leave these countries alone ,Libya ,Iraq ,Afghanistan would of been better off if we hadn’t intervened,and had our own children maimed and killed,or is there oil to be had.
5331 2018-08-18 18:55:29 Have you tried sokoto??
5332 2018-08-18 18:55:26 Extra virgin olive oil... not just plain ones... @JustPlainTwit  might have just plain olive oil...
5333 2018-08-18 18:55:19 Oil?...
5334 2018-08-18 18:55:18 To me, one of the best feelings is getting my oil changed... lol
5335 2018-08-18 18:54:50 Either the oil drain plug for the engine, or a boat drain plug (which normally would have a chain connected)
5336 2018-08-18 18:54:39 I’m sorry I have in the beard oil your TC sent to me. It smells fantastic.
5337 2018-08-18 18:54:38 Oh man vaping is where it's at for me too. I need to get a Pax but I love my teeny oil vape pen.
5338 2018-08-18 18:54:36 Looking forward to #AAOG next week - 50dma providing support, was incredibly well BID Friday PM, drill underway and whose to say they won’t hit R1/R2 by next Monday 27th, so should see a nice run this week into Friday’s close for those wanting in for oil shows or R1/R2 layer hit
5339 2018-08-18 18:54:36 The last one. Fear of racist label and disapproval from the oil countries is the reason HMG make most decisions in UK. Nowt to do with right or wrong, law or order. Many lefties are just a bunch of virtue-signalling nitwits.
5340 2018-08-18 18:54:34 What oil do you mean ?? 
5341 2018-08-18 18:54:31 Lol, Every single ounce of success you have has been bought and paid for by a Saudi Prince with oil money.. none of it is earned at all.. which is why I don’t consider you a rival anymore, you’re a toy for a billionaire playing football manager with a cheat code.

5346 2018-08-18 18:53:42 Criminals should be put on an abandoned oil rig!!!
5347 2018-08-18 18:53:38 The recipe includes ingredients that are specifically put to counteract the negative effects of the castor oil. I tried it, and it started contractions every time, the first time I dilated to 2 cm but I never went into labor. Inductions seem to be the only way for me though lol
5348 2018-08-18 18:53:34 Maybe someone knows.... 5 gallons hydraulic/transmission oil was added to a large tank for a swather hydrostatic drive.  How big of a problem is that? The recommended oil is 15W40
5349 2018-08-18 18:53:26 Just plain olive oil, worchester sauce, lime juice and braai salt. Hot coales, 3 min max on each side.
5350 2018-08-18 18:53:21 I had a customer get mad at me today because the only oil filter I had avalible for his vehicle was going to cost him an extra $10. He told me he didn't think he should have to pay extra for my fuck up. (Yes sir I totally knew you where coming and sold all of the cheaper filters)
5351 2018-08-18 18:53:09 By the way an SSL isn't needed as Im not selling u anything so don't be put off by that wording Google puts up to dissuade you from visiting. White List me.

5354 2018-08-18 18:52:57 These things you do is gaslighting. Is it that you absolve him of not responding appropriately to an imminent recession? Or you absolve him of an opportunity to deliver Nigeria from dependence on oil? Bros, PMB’s government didn’t do zilch until until February 2017.
5355 2018-08-18 18:52:40 Like he aint gonna be makin me pay for the new tires, the oil change, or the brakes and those are hella more expensive than a full tank of gas

5360 2018-08-18 18:51:51 Okay. I think you misunderstand the process of supermarket food product development, and also what I am saying about the normal ingredients of the British Pork Pie and why adding #palmoil and rapeseed oil is very bad. But I will DM you to see what you can tell me.

5366 2018-08-18 18:51:34 You’re forgetting #England claims most of #WhiskyExports and a lot of oil comes from #unidentifiedsources . Oil on the up, too! Add to that the #GERS figures which are estimates and we're done.

5369 2018-08-18 18:51:21 does oil enter your model?  

wonder a bit about the calibration of the fx effect given that it in a sense was predicting a flat C/A last year, with weaker TRY offsetting the domestic credit stimulus (e.g. output over potential).

5375 2018-08-18 18:50:04 I am so curious about them. I wouldn’t want anything with thc in it just because for my school and career path I get drug tested often and thc is a no no but I’ve heard amazing things about cbd oil without thc. Would beat the medications I have to take every day.

5377 2018-08-18 18:49:27 Lol idk why, but i Googled your problem, and what i found is yes hard water can damage hair
Sol
1. Get a shower filter head
2. Apply coconut oil at night
3. Use hydrating shampoo (idk what's that)
4. Rinse your hair with filtered water after washing it

5389 2018-08-18 18:48:17 Unfortunately it is not the same thing, when the Saudi’s bought Port Arthur, it was to refine oil for US consumption.

5430 2018-08-18 18:44:23 This has been not so secret for decades. No other time I can remember has the spotlight been shined on it as it is now. Lobbying on issues not bad inherently, just when connections override fundamental decision making based on facts and relevant data.

5437 2018-08-18 18:42:34 Stainless steel, sufficient coconut oil, high heat to start, then turn it down as the edges show visible signs of cooking. Drag the spatula through the middle repeatedly, letting the runny bits flow downhill. Flip once a semi solid mass. Too low of temp too soon and it'll stick.
5438 2018-08-18 18:42:31 Disagree. We are advocating (directly or indirectly) moving away from coal, oil and gas, abandoning 150+ years of human organisation. This is not 'just the facts m'am!'.
5439 2018-08-18 18:42:04 I've finally relented and I'm giving CBD oil a try for pain management. Starts today. Apparently it can take up to two weeks to fully take affect. I'll update over the coming weeks on how it's going. 
5440 2018-08-18 18:41:31 Do any of you give CBD oil to your pets? What brand do you use? I've found a few reputable looking ones but who knows, they could be lying about 3rd party verification.

5443 2018-08-18 18:41:04 Step Three : Moisturizer Some people don't have to use lotion/cream if it feels to heavy on their skin. Instead use serum and ampule because you still need something to moisturize your face. If moisturizer feels okay on your skin, try light,  oil free lotion.

5462 2018-08-18 18:38:55 Olive oil &amp; Mustard oil are the better ones, when it comes to cooking oil.
5463 2018-08-18 18:38:24 Sump plug? Given the lack of oil all over the road, the plug being gone is probably the least of their worries.

5468 2018-08-18 18:37:38 By late 2014 Nigeria was on well on the path of a recession. Look at GDP growth data: 

Q3 2014: 6.23%
Q4: 5.93%
Q1 2015: 3.96%
Q2 2015: 2.35%

With halving of oil prices in 2014, and absence of a savings buffer for the ‘rainy day’, the economy was doomed well before May 29, 2015

5479 2018-08-18 18:36:41 I just made a face exfoliator with Mediterranean Sea salt, aloe vera gel, coconut oil, and witchhazel and let me tell you, my face feels AMAZING!
5480 2018-08-18 18:36:39 I Luv Vodka!  Spritzer for your linens: 1c Vodka + 1c H2O + 16 drops essential oil: to disinfect & freshen
5481 2018-08-18 18:36:37 Okay but it has oil in it.
5482 2018-08-18 18:36:27 Finally remembered to get my oil changed... only 5000 miles over 
5483 2018-08-18 18:36:22 It's the same way for essential oil products. I feel you
5484 2018-08-18 18:35:45 If vegetable oil comes from vegetables, then where does extra virgin oil come from ? 
5485 2018-08-18 18:35:44 Got Ty oil change, car wash. I cleaned the inside too. Now I’ma fill up her tank up 
5486 2018-08-18 18:35:44 Even worse, I'm an anarcho-communist and frankly the opinions of a bunch of rich and very dead slave owners don't really matter to me. And the troops aren't protecting anyone's freedom but oil companies and capitalism.
5487 2018-08-18 18:35:42 met an eager oil rigger last night trying to catch a Squirtle at Twycross Zoo #PokemonGo

5489 2018-08-18 18:35:33 These fucking guys st the car place have their oil change slips on all the open seats and not one of them will move their paper and let me sit down. Unbelievable.

5491 2018-08-18 18:35:07 I'm not really sure. I had such a bad reaction when I tried smoking medical grade, I'm terrified 2 try the oil. It might B different, but I don't want 2 end up in the ER again. Nothing can help my phantom pains, but I'm hoping that eventually, PT will help with the other stuff.
5492 2018-08-18 18:35:06 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
5493 2018-08-18 18:35:05 I always wait to the last minute to change my oil :/
5494 2018-08-18 18:34:47 พูดถึงวัง ออยไปได้แน่เหรอครับ
5495 2018-08-18 18:34:40 Oh. The dealer service center closes at 1pm.
hmm
Guess I'll just go get the shit I need to do an oil change myself lol
5496 2018-08-18 18:34:38 Talk about me if you want to but YOU DONT KNOW THE PRICE I HAD TO PAY FOR THE OIL IM CARRYING
5497 2018-08-18 18:34:36 But let's also not discount the TERRIBLE oil-for-money deals the government made with China. Plus bad deals with Russia. I predict Venezuela is going to be agricultural heavy after this with most of it being owned by China.
5498 2018-08-18 18:34:22 So. Put your oil based products away. Including phone, tablet and computer. Stop eating food grown and transported using petroleum products
5499 2018-08-18 18:34:21 gotcha!!! thank you...i need all the advice i can get lol

5504 2018-08-18 18:33:45 So the company I was planning on using for CBD oil and personal products is no longer in the running. I'm very disappointed with the response to questions I had. I will be going on Monday to the local dispensary and hopefully they'll be knowledgeable and helpful.
5505 2018-08-18 18:33:38 It took PMB over 100 days to appoint his cabinet - an action which painted a directionless government,  further dissuading investor's from investing.

This in addition to the global slump of oil price where responsible, NOT the previous administration.
5506 2018-08-18 18:33:36 Just checking.
5507 2018-08-18 18:33:21 Oh my fck I came just for an oil change & now I'm also getting an alignment & a new air filter.

5510 2018-08-18 18:32:52 I’m pretty pooped but so far okay. Ibuprofen does seem enough to ward inflammation away. Cbd is better but it’s also like 25x more expensive lol (compare a £2.50 box of ibuprofen to a £50 bottle of cbd oil...)
5511 2018-08-18 18:32:46 Sigh...  new tires on the new car! Wahhhhh!!  Also super fun almost faceplanting walking through mcd’s parking lot and slipping in oil or something...  ahhh! Glad I’m eating local! Gross!

5516 2018-08-18 18:32:05 Mind the price of crude oil then o. As at 2015 it dropped to less than $40. @BBoason please read the article and tell me if it was the delay in the appointment of Ministers that caused the recession again.
5517 2018-08-18 18:31:50 ROCHA 
5518 2018-08-18 18:31:47 I’v tried lash serums, black castor oil, non black castor oil and my lashes are still struggling.
5519 2018-08-18 18:31:42 O.M.F.G - OIL MAY FORM GREASE

Also that's amazing!!
5520 2018-08-18 18:31:42 The only essential oil I need is Castrol 10W40
5521 2018-08-18 18:31:33 Please stop expanding your oil sands Alberta
5522 2018-08-18 18:31:28 And they did it all without oil. Still, saying that it was because the Earth was much warmer can be shown by science. Oh, wait, science is saying you're full of crap.
5523 2018-08-18 18:30:56 They are struggling because they lacked “storage”. Germany has the bun, lettuce, tomato, but no Patty. This is what Tesla brings to market on a massive scale. You need the full meal deal package for it to work. It’s like oil & gas with no pipeline. Done.
5524 2018-08-18 18:30:42 May be low tranny oil ?
5525 2018-08-18 18:30:40 Stop expanding the oil sands

5550 2018-08-18 18:26:34 Step one : Cleansing  For oily skin, cleansing is most important step. Use oil free facial cleansers to avoid more sebum production. Clean and Clear and Neutrogena is facial cleanser brands I recommend for oily skin.
5551 2018-08-18 18:26:28 That’s why you don’t let your pets outside by themselves. He should be boiled in oil!
5552 2018-08-18 18:26:26 Sen. Rand Paul, is likely key to the so far unofficial in your face Russian Republican United Petrostates. 

IMO, waiting till after US 2020 elections to spike oil upward to $100 again one way or the other.
5553 2018-08-18 18:26:18 Future pointer for cashiers at the @WholeFoods on Prospect Street:

When you pack a plastic container of olives in a paper bag, make sure it’s not sideways and that it’s really closed, or I end up with a soggy bag and my bottle of olive oil ends up smashed on the sidewalk.

5557 2018-08-18 18:25:49 I just started the CBD oil from Herbstrong on Monday and I must say it definitely has been helping 
5558 2018-08-18 18:25:38 Canadian produced oil to be refined in Canada would create jobs and allow a made in Canada price to reduce food and transportation costs. Secure and not affected by speculators.
5559 2018-08-18 18:25:35 got a question Indivisible, Tom Perez just agreed to allow fossil fuel donations , what the fuck is that all about?  i thought HRC and her peps wanted "clean corp. investment" i.e. insurance and banks now the dems are in bed with big oil? *shakes head*
5560 2018-08-18 18:25:32 Shale oil is hardly a threat to us. Because of its purity levels. As for Libya and Iraq that's good for all OPEC producers.
5561 2018-08-18 18:25:21 It’d be hilarious if you actually owned some oil wells.
5562 2018-08-18 18:25:10 I'm getting an oil change right now so it'll be a little before i can start the drive right now. I'll let you know when I'm done with that and if i should meet you elsewhere
5563 2018-08-18 18:25:08 Where can I buy CBD oil in Colorado?
5564 2018-08-18 18:25:01 Haha, Leonard  liked my comment without recognizing I hold a contrary position. Your desire for unfettered growth in the oil sector is the problem
5565 2018-08-18 18:24:55 Annan’s tenure was a low point of this body. Slow response to Rwanda, Bosnia, genocide in Sudan, scandals in “Oil for Food” was riddled w corruption and mismanagement. Lastly his failure on human rights commission which was populated w worst offenders.
5566 2018-08-18 18:24:52 Finally getting my oil change , next I need food 
5567 2018-08-18 18:24:50 stressing the NO OIL.

5569 2018-08-18 18:24:23 How about millions of people including women, children killed by US in Iraq, in Syria, in Afghanistan and libiya for the sole purpose of looting their oil and resources. How about innocent people killed in lynching all in the name of beef. Want to know more such killings?.
5570 2018-08-18 18:24:01 ISO anyone that can do an oil change on a Mini Cooper. now I know everyone on the planet is going to comment something but I'm hoping you're within a 10 mile radius
5571 2018-08-18 18:23:56 Agreed. Don't go short in NIFTY , all macros are in favour if oil stays below 75. If it breaches 75 , then u can bet ur house on shorting NIFTY.
5572 2018-08-18 18:23:56 Lol I knew someone who used vagasil and it worked for that horse. I usually bath my horses with a little dish soap and baby oil in the water and that works most of the time. Also make sure they’re clean under the tail, sometimes that’s what they’re trying to scratch.
5573 2018-08-18 18:23:55 Shortage of engine oil...
5574 2018-08-18 18:23:51 Cbd oil (not to be confused with thc oil) good for pretty much anything it just had a bad taste according to my mom (her fiance uses it for pain and stuff so he doesn't take his oxcodon)
5575 2018-08-18 18:23:41 the oil burnt me and i have no idea if that make sense but it hurts 
5576 2018-08-18 18:23:30 Askies. Make sure your hair is always moisturized. Coconut oil is your best friend. When long enough, braids will be your best friend.
5577 2018-08-18 18:23:24 I just want some red oil dumplings in my life yo
5578 2018-08-18 18:23:17 Oil for food!!! Envoy to Rwanda oversaw a genocide. U.N. Envoy to Syria.. Another one who feathered his own nest. I don’t doubt that he had good intentions. And wanted to make the world a better place. But decisions on the ground seemed to be beyond him
5579 2018-08-18 18:23:14 I finally persuade my wife to let me change the oil in her car myself and I forgot to unscrew the cap in the used oil catch pan causing the entire 4+ quarts of oil in the engine to go streaming down our driveway. 
5580 2018-08-18 18:23:08 For a second I wondered why Right wing media is full of guys selling these snake oil pills. The. I realize. The audiences are gullible and will buy anything.

5590 2018-08-18 18:22:16 The only reason in Afghanistan is to protect the multinational corporation. Russia oil pipeline, US and Canada minerals.
5591 2018-08-18 18:22:05 Just simple question, do they play the National Anthem at your job?  Why is it your right to criticize them and their behavior at work? No one comes to your work site and tells you how to put the fries in the oil, do they?
5592 2018-08-18 18:22:05 @CornNuts The Ranch flavor has to be opened at the bottom, else it tastes like plain over cooked corn kernels. The ranch seasoning settles to the bottom of the bag. The kernels could use an oil film to allow the seasoning to attach to them. Think oily fries and salt. More later.
5593 2018-08-18 18:22:01 When I was buying broad beans from my local mobile veg man in Crete he told me his mother fries the beans in the pod in butter and a little oil.

5595 2018-08-18 18:21:17 Knowing that NDA2 had lot of factors in their favour like low oil prices, no coalition indecisiveness, absolute majority etc... The current numbers are in fact a bit depressing.
5596 2018-08-18 18:21:12 And I use good skincare products that have worked wonders for me before and I am on top of it. Tea tree oil, masks religiously, proper makeup removal (when I wear it) making sure my hands are clean before cleansing, toning, the whole-9!

5601 2018-08-18 18:20:59 Andrew, Andrew ... I am right of center, but I can’t stand idly by and listen to this bullshit. Obviously gas prices are up because oil has gone up, which in turn, as you know, is a net benefit to Canada. Do better and tell the truth instead of trying to score on cheap shots!
5602 2018-08-18 18:20:48 Try to use a moisturizing mask every week. By using cheap products like honey, oil and bananas. Also, shampoo your hair every three weeks. It may seem weird at first but your hair needs all the moisture it can get!

5608 2018-08-18 18:19:47 Texas has a more diversified economy and as I've shown the oil patch is not a great source of their employment any more. Less work and lower pay. 

They also calculate their unemployment rate differently.

And you would make more at Tim Hortons in AB than working a rig in Texas

5619 2018-08-18 18:18:47 Propylene Glycol...
Propylene (propene) is produced from refining crude oil and gas.  
Glycol is basically antifreeze.

You're inhaling oil/gas and antifreeze, and that's not even talking about what is used for the flavours.

lol.
5620 2018-08-18 18:18:46 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia is doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.
5621 2018-08-18 18:18:45 Time to go get an oil change. Bah.
5622 2018-08-18 18:18:43 This girl been driving this car around with no oil in here at all... how?!?
5623 2018-08-18 18:18:39 A hot oil treatment might be a good idea as well.
5624 2018-08-18 18:18:33 Ireland, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lativa, Lithuania, Estonia don't deal with Oil like this and are EU members.

5629 2018-08-18 18:18:24 And who's fault is that??? The regime in power. They bankrupted every single industry they took over, including the oil industry. With an oil barrel way above the level they received it they have the country in misery

5633 2018-08-18 18:17:44 Yeah. Down here we all sigh when the price of oil approaches 100 USD per barrel. Because we're all well acquainted with that knock on effect.
5634 2018-08-18 18:17:43 Also Uranium One mines Uranium for power plants. Russia already has an abundance of Uranium and doesn’t need ours. Were you this upset when Republicans allowed several of our oil refinery’s to sell shares to the Saudis? It the same thing.
5635 2018-08-18 18:17:37 And that's news to you that you have to plaster that Orange Faced Freak 24/7? No. What about the OFF having Zinke opening pristeen American treasure to oil drilling? You and @cnn are complicit in allowing America to be raped by old white hateful men w/ no moral center. SAD!

5640 2018-08-18 18:17:08 We don't have adequate public transport that's inexpensive/free because the oil industry realised they wouldn't profit from it. They pushed for car ownership so they could sell more petrol.

The oil industry is set for collapse. We reject it.

5643 2018-08-18 18:16:27 Getting an oil change always tests my patience to the limit

I came in and asked for an oil change, not for you to try and sell me an entire new car piece by piece

Please God, make them stop talking to me and change my oil !!!!!!
5644 2018-08-18 18:16:21 I got carded today for the third time in my life... for buying olive oil
5645 2018-08-18 18:16:07 My boys are at wedding and Im going to have lunch by myself. Well I did get an oil change so I’m rewarding myself with lunch but like I’m doing it alone and it’s weird.

5650 2018-08-18 18:15:07 4/11 In Vzla, people constantly need to create strategies to go to work & take public transportation. This is primarily because of the lack of cash & levels of inflation. On top of that, the oil production is collapsing & auto parts are not available.
5651 2018-08-18 18:14:51 It gets harder & harder to respect the police when they man handle a senior lady who is asking a question & ignore ANTIFA thugs attacking a news camera man, let anti oil protesters set up camp & commit acts of violence with no recourse.
5652 2018-08-18 18:14:44 Back when I was changing oil I would have loved to have such a conversation. I had no such luck. 
5653 2018-08-18 18:14:42 My son suffered badly from eczema as a baby too. Dermatologist told us to use Eucerin bath and shower oil to bathe him and epizone E ointment. Still works like a charm till today. Good luck babe

5658 2018-08-18 18:13:37 Caracas Chricles: the petro doesn’t exist in practice and it isn’t “backed” by any barrels. Even if it were, the oil is underground in a failed State with no rule of law, so it isn’t recoverable. Maduro is trying to set the wage level for the whole country based on… hot air.

5664 2018-08-18 18:13:09 I just keep a vegetable oil damp shop towel and occasionally wipe up the filament going in. I haven’t had a ham either since. @protopasta filament was giving me consistent jams. The oiling helps a lot
5665 2018-08-18 18:13:08 She has many responsibilities to fulfil. EU has applied sanctions in the past.

5671 2018-08-18 18:12:30 When I first moved to Orlando, I didn’t get my oil changed for like a year 
5672 2018-08-18 18:12:29 From US & UK it is also about who has the money to buy our munitions, aircraft, & land mines AND will sell us their oil the cheapest... 
THIS is the religion of western war - big wars make good economies. All the better if its somebody else getting killed.
5673 2018-08-18 18:12:21 This sounds great. Unlike the EPA attitude in the US, who is just a puppet to protect oil industry interests and couldn't care less about the environment.
5674 2018-08-18 18:12:20 @SamsungMobile so my battery dies daily whether I've been using it or not. Which makes it very clear to me that you and anyone who tries to manopolise anything, like those who were tried and found guilty of treason for monopolising oil, is a cunt.

5688 2018-08-18 18:10:46 Worth noting, given U.S. media has ignored it, is the Caspian Sea agreement in which Russia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, & Kazakhstan  have agreed to share the oil & natural found below the Caspian Sea! Yawn...
5689 2018-08-18 18:10:46 Valero is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil.  Helped keep Hugo Chavez and his cronies in charge.
5690 2018-08-18 18:10:30 Why is everyone on this website hating on horse girls & now ukulele girls, but no one is acknowledging essential oil moms are a thing & terrorizing society at every turn

5693 2018-08-18 18:10:13 The main problem in Venezuela was setting high budgets when oil was high, then poor management when it fell. Capitalism would likely have made Venezuela's economy more diverse. Now they scrounge for toilet paper.
5694 2018-08-18 18:10:12 Get it girl
5695 2018-08-18 18:10:08 Also it was literally the intent, the socialist government had stopped opium production and the US was dependent on it so they destabilised the country to establish a government which would give them opium. They've done this all over Latin America w/oil. Don't be fooled.

5697 2018-08-18 18:09:50 That sounds tedious, but could be informative. Palm oil is in a lot of hygienic products and food. Its derivates, like sodium palmitate, are also in a lot of products like carbolic soap. Sustainably harvested palm is less harmful to orangutans than larger scale palm agriculture.
5698 2018-08-18 18:09:47 yes, oil revenue and other taxes which the government collect should be used to sort out domestic problems, not to waste in the proxy war in Syria, or buy weapons from Russia.
5699 2018-08-18 18:09:47 Part of the problem, certainly, but it’s way more complicated than that- i.e. oil prices, mismanagement of currency, political corruption, etc.

Without oil (to pay for technology & development) KSA would look like it stuck in the middle ages.
5740 2018-08-18 18:05:17 And you can’t talk about blockading Canada’s oil without a discussion on our economy, Saudi human rights and environmental policies all the while accepting their oil, while the US gets our oil cheap. @bcndp @Greenpeace @CanadaAction

5744 2018-08-18 18:04:38 And no... The Venezuelan economy was much better before Chavez than it is now... With an oil barrel of 10$ vs they crazy amount to of money they received other the years. You know why? Corruption and fake socialist that want a capitalist lifestyle while the people live in poverty

They can't climb up when you do, was what I was told. I haven't done it, but I don't have the problem.

5761 2018-08-18 18:01:58 If you don’t put frozen things ( i.e cheese sticks , Dino nuggets ) in a skillet with oil ; you’re really selling yourself short
5762 2018-08-18 18:01:57 Ok!! Omarosa is an opportunist but she's smart as hell. I've not yet seen an Omarosa adversary/antagonist chew her up and spit her out, even when she's wrong as corduroy in the Summer. Omarosa, as much as we've disowned her, doesn't need a team. You just can't slick an oil can.
5763 2018-08-18 18:01:51 U know my dad better be proud of me I was a daddy’s girl and instead of playing princess I was gettin covered in oil helping him fix the car  #notallgirlsaregirlygirls
5764 2018-08-18 18:01:49 President Trump supports crooked Paul Manafort but, of course, birds of a feather fly together. Trump is losing the most ardent supporters from his base except those without the IQ to understand that they’re being lied to multiple times a day by the “Snake Oil Salesman”.
5765 2018-08-18 18:01:48 And Ricky stop saying you're defending this country when 9/11 was set up so we can invade countries for oil pipelines and control of the Opium Market.

5769 2018-08-18 18:01:06 They think all money earned inside a country really belongs to the government, and the extent to which they let you keep it is just them being nice.

5777 2018-08-18 17:59:27 The same freedom brought to Iraq: 1- Iran rules Iraq now after Iraq won the 1st Gulf War 1988. 
2- Iran steals more than 80% of Iraqi crude oil.
3- Iraq has more than 400 pro-Iran Shi’ite militia killing any Iraqi who is against Iran.

5803 2018-08-18 17:56:17 Love #reelingintheyears it shows great clips of important events and trivia we all have forgotten.  Tonight it is 1974 and I see my beloved #BantryBay covered in an oil spill, how sad.   Just think in 5 years 1979, it explodes #Whiddydisaster
5804 2018-08-18 17:56:04 yeah! we actually had that same brand oil leftover already so we just added em together and it'll be stored in the closet with our other car junk

5810 2018-08-18 17:55:35 Also - u think the oil companies wouldn’t take that 5% as profit?
5811 2018-08-18 17:55:32 It comes down to this. Do you care about your fellow citizen or are you so jealous of God's love you'll follow a snake oil salesman like Graham? Despite knowing it violates Christ's teachings.

5814 2018-08-18 17:55:03 Medical cannabis. Take away our dependency with overpriced   meds that create more problems than they address. I was on opiates for 10 years before I tried CBD oil. My quality of life has improved greatly.
5815 2018-08-18 17:55:00 The sanctions to Venezuela came long after the economic collapse was well developed. Look up dates and at least inflation. Also look up how much oil did the so called revolution sold to the US in it's 20 yrs in power. They had more money the the previous 10 presidents combined...
5816 2018-08-18 17:54:49 Just a little cleaning, getting it inspected, oil change, full tank of gas...

5818 2018-08-18 17:54:42 supplement companies that intentionally spam snake oil ads on his show, and other investors invested in his views without outright publicly declaring financial support
5819 2018-08-18 17:54:39 Elon doesn't care about that, he only wants "Big Oil" Saudis to save Tesla from bankruptcy, because his $55 BILLION (!!!!) compensation package disappears if Tesla goes bankrupt.

Every person who thinks it is possible 2 create better world with current rus/gov is either idiot or slave of russian oil.

Amazon has an option to add a protection plan to oil paint tubes.

How... How does that even work...?
5833 2018-08-18 17:52:36 The ones calling it invasion are the ones you're trying to justify waging war against, the same government who rose against those advances in women's rights. Turns out that for the U.S., the enemy of the enemy is your enemy as well, because you just want everyone's oil.

5838 2018-08-18 17:52:02 We have Congressmen that enter office with nothing and leave as millionaires, on a gov salary.

Somehow they knew to invest in land a year before mining or oil leases, or b4 a major highway was to be built there.

And we are so stupid that we vote the same politicians back in.
5839 2018-08-18 17:51:55 Right! Don the Con...sell that snake oil!

5854 2018-08-18 17:50:09 For now it's more taxes. And a few austerity measures. At the end of the day we haven't sold any oil so we haven't got any income coming in from our major export. And Trumps uneducated meddling in the situation between Saudi Arabia and Iran affects all oil produces. So to say
5855 2018-08-18 17:50:01 Marinade in olive oil and crushed garlic for 5 mins. Meanwhile melt 1 tbsp butter in a shallow pan. Fry until it just starts to crisp and season with paprika. Serve immediately on a salad of spinach leaves and halved cherry toms.

5863 2018-08-18 17:49:16 Lol 'look at Venezuela' is such a poor argument.

We're not Venezuela. And we don't rely on oil to fund our economy like Venezuela. And we won't be subject to the same Draconian imposition of tariffs, restrictions, etc as Venezuela.
5864 2018-08-18 17:49:16 Now going to Amsterdam 
5865 2018-08-18 17:49:07 In my culture olive oil really fixes everything

5867 2018-08-18 17:49:00 It actually takes a lot to hold back the American economy but 44 seemed to do his best to hold back oil, destroy coal, regulate business like a strangle hold, I remember him discouraging business owners with things like “you didn’t create that” I remember a GDP that never hit 3%

5871 2018-08-18 17:48:39 Yeah, why anyone would inflate themselves with oil in an attempt to look strong is something I’ll never figure out.
5872 2018-08-18 17:48:34 Oil
5873 2018-08-18 17:48:19 As I said in that correction, it is based on Barrels per day THEREFORE, that means recovered and ready for sale oil, all costs are already covered in the price which is currently around $70
5874 2018-08-18 17:47:39 And the first thing they did was remove oil subsidies. The knock on effect is that the most popular fall back job. I.e. taxi driver is not sustainable. And there's a lot of pensioners on the streets begging.
5875 2018-08-18 17:47:33 Mine will be another few hours mowing. I finished the weed eating in under 2 hours, so I was ecstatic. Started day drinking around 9am with a good cigar, and about to change the oil in my company truck.

5901 2018-08-18 17:43:41 CBD oil has helped me so much with my anxiety as well!!! Especially while driving
5902 2018-08-18 17:43:27 It was an oil change that messed up my transmission.

5904 2018-08-18 17:42:21 Everyone agrees that bonds are in a bubble and oil is dropping on the fact that China can easily evade tariffs by buying oil from Iraq and now maybe Russia as well as devaluate it's currency which increases the risk of EU contagion. Why then isn't SPX the best investment option?

5908 2018-08-18 17:41:49 came to get an oil change and my booj ass mom is leaving with a new car lmfao
5909 2018-08-18 17:41:43 BTW oil for food was introduced in 1995 and Kofi got into office 1997. Having a problem with your maths skills?

5912 2018-08-18 17:41:09 I’m hoping so! I splurged and got an essential oil thing since I’m already using a gift card. I need the R&R!
5913 2018-08-18 17:41:06 The new cityscape. Houses in HB look out onto a missile silo. Others in MB onto oil refineries. Now these onto pumpjacks. You need a big reality distortion field to ignore that view.
5914 2018-08-18 17:40:59 Let’s say I have an opinion about curly hair. I FEEL like if you use cream before oil you’ll have curly coils. Then Boom bitches start using cream before oil now Issa fact that cream before oil promotes curly coils
5915 2018-08-18 17:40:45 They got enough oil under them to make the hole country rich. But it’s not about the people it’s about making the cooks rich

5918 2018-08-18 17:40:33 Just think of all the useless government bureaucrats that $280 million could employ.

5921 2018-08-18 17:40:12 Idiot how about you use the timeline. Clinton introduced oil for food, the UN Secretary General at the time was Guterres. Kofi Annan got into office in 1997. The program was running before he took office. Sending a link from Washington post proves how stupid.

5940 2018-08-18 17:38:10 Milk it all you can, Tharoor, milk it all you can! However the World knows that Kofi was involved in the ‘Oil for Food’ scam and you helped cover up the part played by Kojo, son of Kofi!
5941 2018-08-18 17:38:09 CORRECTION - HAS been out of control for some time.  Once again, an Oligopoly has cornered an important segment of the American market and is "fixing" things their way - railroad, oil, gas, media, telephones and now Internet.  Will we never learn?? Oligopolies kill democracy.

5943 2018-08-18 17:37:53 Why don’t you start looking after Canada. You’ve over taxed us, put us in Billions if debt, run amuck and won’t put up a wall to stop illegal immigrants, bought an oil pipeline with tax dollars and it wasn’t needed, can’t work a NAFTA. UNeed toQuit politics.
5944 2018-08-18 17:37:52 And in that period of time, other assets have had bear markets and onto new bull markets. Crypto and oil for example. So if you go nowhere for another few years, you are missing out

You are delusional just like so many others and it`s no wonder Nicola doesn`t want the growth commission report debated until she can concoct a story around it. You are onto plums here pal absolutely wasting your time.
5976 2018-08-18 17:34:02 That was factories, not extraction, right? (though I don't know what's worse)
The amount of oil extraction that still goes on in LA County is nuts. There's active oil wells in Beverly Hills, most famously on the high school campus.

The rest of them were either “communism is bad” or “this country has oil”.

Two of them were a draw or a flat loss.
6002 2018-08-18 17:30:17 No he didn't, you see that's what happens when you haven't read and therefore, don't actually know what was said in the report. Let me help.
The report was talking about Norway growing a £1trillion Oil Fund, IF Scotland did the same it would take 20 years to achieve the same

6008 2018-08-18 17:29:47 I never follow the instructions on a frozen pizza. If I'm going to slum it, I rub olive oil on the crust, cook it until the cheese starts to melt and the crust has risen, then move it directly beneath the broiler for five minutes. Be amazed when pizza tastes 1000x better.

6013 2018-08-18 17:29:24 Any soil contamination would have to be remediated first... the faster we get rid of active oil wells & the air/soil pollution they cause, the better.
6014 2018-08-18 17:29:22 i really need to invest in oil paints.
6015 2018-08-18 17:29:20 near me, in greenpoint, brooklyn they're still finding new stuff that's been polluted by the oil industry all the time (though no one seemed to care until white people started moving then en masse)
6016 2018-08-18 17:29:18 But it's not extracting oil and gas that necessarily made life longer or healthier.

Nice try, though.

6024 2018-08-18 17:28:15 As oil prices are low of all time, US is buying it really cheap. This Venezuela is advantageous for US than a stable, resourceful and happy Venezuela.
6025 2018-08-18 17:28:13 Nigeria as highest producer of crude oil in Africa with 2.4million barrels per day with 70% Youth Unemployment rate. Young Nigerians should rise up, say NO to job export, Capital Flight and corruption in the Oil & Gas Industry.

6032 2018-08-18 17:27:26 It is fact that Kofi has a bad legacy in terms of Iraq invasion and sanctions imposed on it , also he  was criticized for not expanding the Security Council and faced calls for resignation after an investigation into the Oil-for-Food Programme.

6037 2018-08-18 17:26:56 Have you seen some of your tweets Donald Trump? When you scream #fakenews many of your followers the discriminate against those new agencies even when they tell the truth. You sir sell snake oil & this damages America. Also blocking people is a form of censorship as well

6047 2018-08-18 17:26:06 Sure, the bar graph states as much. But growth of nearly 10M barrels a day in less than decade is by no means a leveling off in the oil industry. Especially in times of extreme limited capacity when it comes to production.
6048 2018-08-18 17:26:03 Condition that shit with coconut oil 
6049 2018-08-18 17:26:01 I am asking. Would that have increased our earning from oil? Would that increase our reserve? Would that make $ more readily available to boost investors confidence? How will the appointments help?

6053 2018-08-18 17:24:57 I'm a fan of jasmine essential oil, love how the Lush jasmine and henna fluff eaze smells on me, not everyone loves jasmine but I do, my guy from India often leaves oils and fragrance in his hair that smell like fresh coconut or he wears the jasmine one

6066 2018-08-18 17:23:25 @DrRayBakes Arg I just made an ottolenghi parsnip cake and forgot the oil.. Will it b ok? It smells good and looks ok.. Hoping the veg moisture will help.
6067 2018-08-18 17:23:16 Delicious with garlic & mint. Sweat 'til very soft in 50/50 olive oil/butter, with lid on. Add bit of garlic final stages. Smash up half roughly with potato masher when done. Should be quite creamy. Add lots of chopped mint & pecorino or parmasan. Delish on pasta or as side

6070 2018-08-18 17:22:46 I’m realising real quick that once I start working in oil & gas there’s no going back to the music world & it’s quite sad to think about but what to do sacrifices must be made

6077 2018-08-18 17:22:04 @SecretaryZinke TR is turning in his grave watching your disgraceful disregard for science and the good people who work to protect America's public land. Leasing our precious resources to big oil and gas for monetary gain is tantamount to stomping on TR's ideals and policies.
6078 2018-08-18 17:21:58 Every other night I use Pratima skincare's rejuvenating essential oil, this one smells good too, her Pitta Essential oil smells like the perfect blend of ylang ylang, sandalwood, rose and jasmine, I think people who dislike jasmine would still like this
6079 2018-08-18 17:21:50 Some of the oil cleansing stated ada mineral oil . Beware . Takut tak sesuai nanti naik bintik2 kecik . Patch test dulu .
6080 2018-08-18 17:21:46 I literally wash my face with coconut oil and it works great. Lavender essential oil will help get rid of scars and frankincense oil will prevent break outs!! After you wash your face, use the frankincense all over your face and the lavender only on spot.
6081 2018-08-18 17:21:31 Yes, but it doesn’t mean we should fight meaningless wars for large corpprates, politicians vested interests or oil
6082 2018-08-18 17:21:16 The best part is the olive oil substitute suggestion. 
6083 2018-08-18 17:21:15 1,000,000% inflation rate
And this is an oil-rich country, Venezuela
Oil production was 3,000,000 BOPD (barrels of oil per day) 20 years ago
Now 1,000,000 BOPD with 300,000 BOPD of those going to Cuba

6093 2018-08-18 17:20:19 In 1859, Edwin Drake dug the first oil well and refined the oil to produce kerosene, initially discarding the petrol. The prominence of petrol wasn’t recognized until 1892. Petrol sparked the industrial revolution which was the catalyst to create the world we live in today.

6097 2018-08-18 17:20:00 Third world produce is generally in EBA, GSP and GSP+ at 0% but don't let facts get in the way. We also import gas, oil and electricity but again, facts

6122 2018-08-18 17:17:05 I think you just totally misread the chart, dude. The green bars is oil revenue which lowers internationally with the price of owl. The colored lines is Venezuela’s inflation rate over time- not the other way around.

6126 2018-08-18 17:16:45 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President please reconsider your efforts to change the Endangered Species Act. We are nothing without our beautiful environment.

6136 2018-08-18 17:15:22 Fine. 4 tsp coconut oil, 6 cubic ice cubes, 4 ML rainwater (if you do 5, your kidneys will explode and you will die in mere seconds), 1/2 Apple sliced horizontally, place in blender for 22 seconds. Remove from blender and pour into hollowed out pineapple. Eat entirely with a leaf

a) never decompose (and therefore breaks into microplastics over time that we then consume)
b) are derived from oil, natural gas, & coal
c) cannot be sourced sustainably, unlike paper products

guess I expect this from Varvel.

6146 2018-08-18 17:14:40 . @sunlornegunter How much of the $300-B will major oil and gas producers put into wind and solar developments?
Seems likely that in a competition for capital AB’s higher-cost oil will lose to renewables.
6147 2018-08-18 17:14:38 I was supposed to get an oil change 3k miles ago! 
I’m finally here. Let’s get this oil change done

6150 2018-08-18 17:14:29 It took time and thoughtful planning, & that was for a country with an already high rate of bike riders. Since the 70's, after the oil crisis & too many chi9ldren killed!

6158 2018-08-18 17:13:54 It is fear, but I think not all identity per se. It is hard to accept the damage we’ve done - especially if you’re in a coal or oil community.  There’s mourning to be done, before you leave it in the past. Hard to face when some prominent voices tell you you don’t have to. 
6159 2018-08-18 17:13:53 Woke up early, cashed a check, changed my cars brakes And did an oil change, now its getting oil sprayed, walked dogo, pulled green beans from the garden, yay for being productive!

6177 2018-08-18 17:12:23 @jelynchjr @samwils18 @Pat_Egan My embarrassing story is when I accidentally jacked off in a dark basement using baseball glove oil. I was basically shellacking myself. My we we still looks like George Hamilton
6178 2018-08-18 17:12:22 Trudeau doesn’t really work. His grandfather was rich form oil , his dad got it and now the idiot has it.  We don’t need another holiday for remembering reconciliation but Trudeau doesn’t want to work. Just party and selfie
6179 2018-08-18 17:12:22 I understand from my environmental friends that oil drilling has resulted in a growth boom among AK species and that the caribou population has exploded.  Hmm, whom should I believe?  Decisions, decisions.  
6180 2018-08-18 17:12:18 It’s so hot, I smell every product I put in my hair yesterday. I’m getting a free hot oil treatment just trying to buy groceries
6181 2018-08-18 17:12:05 Sarri’s machine is out of oil after 40 minutes 
6182 2018-08-18 17:11:43 But she wins in the end!  Aoili is just mayo and none of us knew that before!

(Which it's also not.  The most traditional is just garlic and olive oil.  But I'm not shocked she doesn't know that.)
6183 2018-08-18 17:11:36 I do this with my STEM Ss and they absolutely love this activity!  If it hardens up, you can add a few drops of oil!
6184 2018-08-18 17:11:20 I am done with pro football.ESPN is a joke.Politics and football are like oil and vinegar.They don't mix.High School and College only but never ESPN.
6185 2018-08-18 17:11:16 start using jojoba or almond oil instead of lotion. pro tip.
6186 2018-08-18 17:11:14 This year is the first time that I've had to deal with understatement. Like is there some oil field recruitment?
6187 2018-08-18 17:11:12 I’m currently using the tea tree oil one hahaha but for first impression i think its not that bad... hopefully hahaha thanks for reminding kakeda! I’ll try not to skip and be rajin 
6188 2018-08-18 17:11:08 seriously tho how to get rid these oil from my face?!
6189 2018-08-18 17:10:55 Oil is a '10' so as Mkitaryan and they are not tactically disciplined hence they can't track back and stay with their man .one of them has to be benched.
6190 2018-08-18 17:10:54 It is DEFINITELY less dangerous than alcohol; I would advise against smoking and driving. CBD oil is legal in my state now, in a grey area but they sell it at the smoke shops now. Haven't tried it. It's only a matter of time before my state realizes how much revenue they can make
6191 2018-08-18 17:10:49 Nope... planes use petroleum products made from oil and gas.... apparently those are evil in BC, so I can’t support this.

6193 2018-08-18 17:10:19 Use filtered water, use about 1/5 of the sodium packets. Put an egg in it with sesame oil

6197 2018-08-18 17:09:29 We source  goods from all over the World VIA the EU. Third world produce is priced out via higher EU tariffs.

6199 2018-08-18 17:09:16 And that's a FACT, right? You seem to have cornered the market on that one. Why wouldn't oil companies want to bring in a raving anti-oil lunatic? Sounds logical to me. :)
6200 2018-08-18 17:09:12 The oil cloth dolls in the frame are worth about $150 bucks, we paid $15.
6201 2018-08-18 17:09:00 we sell CBD oil and lotion at the gym! it’s good and have different flavors
6202 2018-08-18 17:08:58 Awesome, oil based company. Kind of like a Castrol or Royal Purple and such.

6214 2018-08-18 17:07:14 Sorry, sorry Donald. This diversionary tactic has no influence on intelligent Americans.  You are directing our focus at your treasonous behavior. Brennan has on position within your government. Your are the one who is selling off America piece by piece to oil companies/Putin.

6216 2018-08-18 17:06:53 Sprite, CBD oil and essential oils fix everything 
6217 2018-08-18 17:06:52 You gotta keep checking it and put enough oil in the rice before cooking. Stir in well
6218 2018-08-18 17:06:41 @WarcraftDevs The fish oil change (removing it from vendors) came too late. Many people got to power level cooking to max. Many people stockpiled 1000s of the oil. Keeping it off the vendor is just a disservice to majority of players now.

Are the same terrorist orgs they finance in Syria the same ones that attacked the tanker in the Red Sea? Now the US will stop aid to the Kurds, SA says they will pay. Turkey & SA have instability
6221 2018-08-18 17:06:31 Sir, did you check what was Crude oil price before and after Modi govt came? The conditions were different for Manmohan govt and Modi govt. Despite the easy and favorable worldwide conditions they couldn't take advantage for it.

6230 2018-08-18 17:05:44 @MauritsGroen how is it possible that #USA with @EPA is destroying the biodiversity and life on Mother Earth. Just because USA is so corrupt and @GOP government get millions of oil industry. No Justice for a lot of PPL in this world (Climate Change will give more refugees).

6234 2018-08-18 17:05:11 Does this mean there are leagues?! I want nothing more than to throw the ball around but have found little luck with people who choose to play only sports involving their feet. I’ll even oil my mitt once in a while but my daughter is having none of it.
6235 2018-08-18 17:05:11 OMG- this is disgusting. Read about his corruption in the Iraqi Oil for Food program, and his routing of money to his son.

6237 2018-08-18 17:04:53 Just waiting on my man to get here so he can oil my scalp. 
6238 2018-08-18 17:04:49 Or you could just just use liquid dish soap like Dawn and Palmolive that would dissolve the oil safely and quickly. Pro tip don't use Gas, Diesel, Wd-40, Paint thinner, acid or nearly all the other replies.
6239 2018-08-18 17:04:44 I really need to get on CBD oil or something because this whole summer my anxiety has been thru the roof

6248 2018-08-18 17:02:18 Correct.  An essential commodity like oil has dipped below the average cost of production before.  Why would gold be any different.
6249 2018-08-18 17:02:12 We’ve known how to change the oil, filters, tires, brakes, wipers, since I was 16. Our parents always made certain we had extra clothes, water, food & a First Aid kit in our vehicles during our youth. 

Still know how, and still carry a FAK. 

Most kids haven’t a clue nowadays.

6277 2018-08-18 16:59:43 I have acne prone skin to and you are right, tea tree oil works on light blemishes. If your dermatologist is confidant, I'm sure laser is the best way to go about it.
6278 2018-08-18 16:59:35 also did she really hate olive oil?
6279 2018-08-18 16:59:32 I disagree #Trudeau has done nothing to support Canada's oil industry, he has stifled our economy & industry, thus Canada's growth.

6285 2018-08-18 16:58:56 Sometimes I wake up at 1. Sometimes I get my oil changed, go grocery shopping, rearrange the kitchen, start laundry and call the maintenance man before 1. It’s about ~balance~

6287 2018-08-18 16:58:48 What if the sale of oil and gas in the Arab world was rejected in US dollars
The value of the US Dollar globally will be in the bottom

They are the slaves of US

6314 2018-08-18 16:55:42 It declined to 2.5% by Q2 in 2015. With the declining oil prices, depleted foreign reserve, rise of crude oil thieves in the Niger Delta and decripit infrastructure. The recession was inevitable even if you bring 100 Okonjo Iwealas.
6315 2018-08-18 16:55:33 Apparently NOT...He put his kids in a barrel of crude oil. There was absolutely nothing perfect about the relationship.
6316 2018-08-18 16:55:23 Was frying a burger in the pan and when i flipped it a lot of oil landed on my hand. So now part of my hand is kinda badly blistered and in a lot of pain :(
6317 2018-08-18 16:55:16 Your dermatologist would advice better, of course, but don't you think facial scrub/tea tree oil etc would be cheaper and painless. Albeit slow.
6318 2018-08-18 16:55:09 Needs about twice the oil and half the water or it'll be big ass pot of cheap ramen.

6320 2018-08-18 16:54:56 The price of oil is higher but not substantially for Western Canadian oil  (hello pipeline regulations) which likely will not offset the increased price of gasoline.

6322 2018-08-18 16:54:29 When i see what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money, developing their countries and giving a better living standard to their citizens I always wonder if Nigeria is selling groundnut oil .
6323 2018-08-18 16:54:24 Things I get to do before moving on:
1. Shape up.
2. Get hot oil or something.
3. Wardrobe.
4. A proper credit card.
6324 2018-08-18 16:54:22 Saudi Arabia has learned that u can bump the price of oil by financing instability. Are the same terrorist orgs they finance in Syria the same ones that attacked the tanker in the Red Sea? Now the US will stop aid to the Kurds, SA says they will pay. Turkey & SA have instability
6325 2018-08-18 16:54:17 Hyd block plugs...see a drip u better change it because tomorrow it will bathe the underside with oil.
6326 2018-08-18 16:54:14 #KofiAnnan's death will surely reignite discussions about rough times at the UN during his tenure. One of them was the 'Oil for Food'scandal which, though embarrassing for him and the UN, was also Bush's payback for his characterization of the 2003 invasion of Iraq as 'illegal"!

6334 2018-08-18 16:52:34 Honest question to @andrew_leach - why does @washington state refuse to ship @montana coal which is burned in @China, yet wants @alberta heavy oil to refine & burn in Puget Sound generating #GHGs in local air shed? Seems environmentally illogical. #bcpoli
6335 2018-08-18 16:52:33 Not if you are using Palm oil illegally harvested from non-sustainable forests! Up your game.

6342 2018-08-18 16:51:51 Making a better world is easy.  It’s governments that have no desire to do it.  We collectively around the world have enough resources to end all wars, hunger, homelessness and suffering.  We should be condemning those oil rich countries to do their part.  I think about it.

6351 2018-08-18 16:51:13 Remember that time you endorsed Heath Mello, pipeline XL supporter? Why don’t you show us your tax returns, is it because you’re heavily invested in big oil?

6353 2018-08-18 16:51:09 Depends on the item. Typically, I dye, oil, and conditional the leather so it is very tactile. However usually that item is to wrap something lol.

6362 2018-08-18 16:50:17 I hope everything turns out well as you cleanse your system to fight this disease. May I suggest organic coconut oil as another means of helping yourself. My wife has been using it for years as a means of fighting her plaques and swears by it.
6363 2018-08-18 16:50:13 Decayed infrastructure is an equally significant cause of further steep decline in oil production, surely? And 100% predictable.
6364 2018-08-18 16:50:01 "Poised to"??

What does that even mean?  Slightly more investment might be made in shale oil as opposed to oil sands but that is the reality of easier to access oil when prices are down. 

Its pretty sad how you repeatedly pretend not to understand market differences.
6365 2018-08-18 16:49:55 We must stop Big Oil from sourcing it.
6366 2018-08-18 16:49:52 I don’t. I just brush with olive oil and squirt a little lemon juice. I season with sea salt and sometimes fresh garlic. It’s perfect :-)
6367 2018-08-18 16:49:47 They are not investing in our shorter term lifecycle projects either. We do have conventional gas and oil reserves in Canada as well, do we not? Less competitive tax situation and less market access for our product = less investment period.
6368 2018-08-18 16:49:36 Idiots.  If they are renting out then it becomes personal income, taxed at a considerably higher rate in CA than the loss from a grandfathered property tax.

6377 2018-08-18 16:48:48 Yup! 2 cups baking soda, 1 cup corn starch, 1.5 cups citric acid, 1oz of oil, enough fragrance to make me happy. You can add 1/2 cup of epsom salts/clays to it without messing it up.

6384 2018-08-18 16:47:59 Most of the work created by Trans Mountain pipeline will be in construction.  I would rather see the Canada East pipeline built. An eastern pipeline would make Canada independent of foreign oil and create far more PERMANENT jobs!  It is also a more environmentally sound option.

6390 2018-08-18 16:47:02 Engage in international politics to help bring up oil price & local politics to stop the sabotage in ND. D cumulative result of all d actions is what we started witnessing frm d 4th quarter of 2016. I challenge anybody 2 state clearly, point by point, what else could have bn done
6391 2018-08-18 16:46:56 Hmnn the question is what policies&speed should hv bn applied to replacing impact of oil on the economy? Or reversing the trend of oil price then? It's the reason I wish we see leadership profiles& of today's analysts. We know so much how come NGR our collective expertise= zero?

6396 2018-08-18 16:46:26 How many Billions of Dollars have left Canada in investment in the oil and gas sector and downstream industries since the election of your beloved Socialists? Mr Professor who probably has never gotten his hands dirty before because he is too busy writing books on opinion

6407 2018-08-18 16:45:14 Took me many years to say no to services other than what I went in for: the final straw for me & dealerships when my BMW oil change $89 escalated to a $600 oil service. No way! Plus they added another $5000 of needed repairs. Couldn't get out of there fast enough.
6408 2018-08-18 16:45:02 If you have tinnitus (?), try CBD oil (orally). The doctors rarely know about this. I find it helps cut down the pitch & volume of the noise..

6426 2018-08-18 16:43:24 My opinion is d new manager did what was suppose to do. 1st, stabilized d obviously crashing economy. This involved blocking leakages & reducing recurrent expenditures. Then try to shore up earning from other sources to reduce pressure occasioned  by drop in oil

6430 2018-08-18 16:42:57 On a more serious note, the IEA notes that globally, oil companies have moved away from large, long-lead time projects. Alberta's oil and gas investments have, for the past 20 years, been dominated by...large, long-lead-time projects.

6448 2018-08-18 16:40:32 They're fantastic. Just a whisper of heat. I also made a paste with the peppers, garlic, & olive oil. It might become my favorite condiment (for those rare occasions when I don't want heat).

6467 2018-08-18 16:38:13 Whats that smell?  Ahh, I've left a pan on the stove and the oil is smoking
6468 2018-08-18 16:38:10 My favorite part of getting my oil changed is when I just don’t do it.

6472 2018-08-18 16:37:58 The huge deployment of funds from banks to unethically multiply credit to coroporates was much more than oil gain. This amount is now stuck in NPA. This has been a very big handicap for present NDA government.
6473 2018-08-18 16:37:58 All I’m saying is I like My bitch smelling like Coconut oil and Coco butter Rather then Bath & body works 
6474 2018-08-18 16:37:41 I hate getting an oil change  just makes me nervous when someone is working on my car

6482 2018-08-18 16:37:00 We are still saying the same thing. Let me break it down a little. Our earning from oil dropped by over 500%, we had no savings, we were short on forex, that's means investors are not confidence of been able to repatriate their money, what could you have done
6483 2018-08-18 16:36:51 How can I sit outside for 2 hours with straight up tanning oil on & still be pale af ..... I didn’t even burn
6484 2018-08-18 16:36:47 Yeah. Obviously she didnt say that. Syria was about oil.

6491 2018-08-18 16:35:50 I use both acrylic and oil, with the acrylic as usually the first draft of a painting.  I use a plastic fine spray bottle to keep acrylic paint wet, and a paint keeper that is a palette with a snap tight lid....great to share painting tips
6492 2018-08-18 16:35:41 I haven’t.   I sprinkle with avocado oil and keg steak spice
6493 2018-08-18 16:35:40 One columnists opinion over the mountains of verifiable data showing a slump in world wide investment during extremely low oil prices...Are you being intentionally misleading or just bad at comprehension?

6499 2018-08-18 16:35:14 We won't have bills of rights for the earth here in US as long as we don't allow intelligent design theories such as Gaia to be taught in science academia. Big Ag, Big Oil, Big Pharma loves we think its about science versus Christian Creationism, church vs state. It's not.
6500 2018-08-18 16:35:04 Visiting the local car wash nearby is a safer option than attempting to purchase the necessary car wash products to clean your car at home. Home car washing pollutes as soap, oil, tar, & dirt can end up in the storm sewers that eventually flow into lakes, streams, & rivers.
6501 2018-08-18 16:35:02 Saudi Arabia has learned that u can bump the price of oil by financing instability. Are the same terrorist orgs they finance in Syria the same ones that attacked the tanker in the Red Sea? Now the US will stop aid to the Kurds, SA says they will pay. Turkey & SA have instability
6502 2018-08-18 16:34:31 Fastest oil change i ever had probably because all the oil out that bitch

6507 2018-08-18 16:33:54 Agreed. But the time to start a 3rd Party would have been right after Nov 16. It’s just really hard. At the least, progressives are withholding the lifeblood of money & support from Dems... that’s why they flip flopped on oil $.

6536 2018-08-18 16:29:57 So the pipeline just creates all this CO2? Interesting. Is there some refinery at the end that turns all the products into CO2?

Or maybe it's people driving cars that are creating all the pollution, who would happily take US or Saudi oil if AB oil not available... FFS

6543 2018-08-18 16:29:00 #China noted and duly rejected ...if US has a problem keep it to itself and if US apply sanction on China then china will stop US oil and gas import and buy it from #Iran. US is in loose loose proposition now not only in Iran but also in North Korea where US is marginalized
6544 2018-08-18 16:28:58 Well, what I think is there will always be oil revenue.its just that as always with Muslims fanatics, they are out to destroy Nig oil if they can’t have it by plunging the country into war. They are a CLAMOROUS LOT !!
6545 2018-08-18 16:28:48 Wondering how much it would help Russian oil sales if Iranian oil was off the market. Wouldn't Putin then be Europe's main supplier?

6548 2018-08-18 16:28:19 what causing that is a huge volcanoes got erupted way deep deep in the ocean and the reason is because we are taking too much oil out of the ground which is the floater and the balancer of earth. it will be a lot worse than that in the future if you don't stop taking oil out.

6561 2018-08-18 16:25:50 Ok didn't realize this recipe was gonna cause me to have so many feelings but olive oil! Italy produces many great olive oils, but in America, the high demand for exclusively Italian oils means many of the mass-market options are likely to be overpriced and lower in quality
6562 2018-08-18 16:25:50 Mining, logging, oil, and the construction industries are the top growers meaning healthier American industry. Real wages are increasing along the line of inflation
6563 2018-08-18 16:25:44 Maybe the taxpayer's money, maybe Putin and the Russian money, maybe from money from oil states in the Middle East, because we all know the is broke and he ain’t no billionaire.

6621 2018-08-18 16:19:22 I have just one word to say... Oil.
6622 2018-08-18 16:19:20 I watched a documentary on the Voyager mission and it made it clear that if we cared to save Earth, we easily could dedicate a team of scientists ans engineers to transitioning away from oil, and they would probably be successful. If we cared.

6640 2018-08-18 16:17:54 The recession was unavoidable. We shouldn't even be discussing this. You may not like Buhari. But hear this, Jonathan was a complete failure. We relied solely on Oil. No diversification, no infrastructure, nothing! He failed.
6641 2018-08-18 16:17:45 Thank God for His glorious light.  B/C a darkness is coming over our land.
Time to replenish our oil.
6642 2018-08-18 16:17:38 Not unless Jesus was one too. The Holy anointing oil was and is real. The recipe is: virgin olive oil, cannabis bud, myrrh oil, cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon leaf oil. Do you think Jesus showed up to perform a few miracles and left us with nothing? He did not.

6645 2018-08-18 16:17:31 This is part of the Zinke narrative that we need to invest in coal and oil or we'll later be fighting wars over energy. It's part of the plans of our adversaries to fall behind in the  global energy producing environment by hieghtening our dependence of foreign energy sources.

6655 2018-08-18 16:16:43 The quarter in which we entered recession, oil production was cut by half.
6656 2018-08-18 16:16:41 Then again, many medical marijuana shops sell extracted oil from marijuana. And they have selectively bred to increase certain compounds and reduce others. So if one is unnatural, the other is no less so.
6657 2018-08-18 16:16:37 No. I’m not. Your entire reality is based on the idea that we must ship oil. Mine is based on We must find an alternative, now.

6664 2018-08-18 16:15:18 Very wise advice; If US economy goes into recession, dollar weakens, and other countries economies will also go into recession along with uncertainty in oil production, and prices, whole world economy crumbles. Let me cut my weekend booze expenses and save for tough times ahead.
6665 2018-08-18 16:15:10 Is your dad really your dad if he doesn’t lecture you about getting your oil changed?
6666 2018-08-18 16:15:03 95 Honda Accord for sale. Car runs and drives great. I do 80mph to work everyday. This car runs perfect. Does not burn or leak oil.

6669 2018-08-18 16:14:52 How many times have we heard the banks warning that investment is fleeing Canada? I don’t think that’s hyperbole one bit. Our oil industry is being decimated while every other oil producing country is flourishing.
6670 2018-08-18 16:14:49 My recipe calls for: 1/2 Cup soy sauce, 1/4 Cup sesame oil, 5 cloves minced garlic, a thumb sized piece of minced ginger, 3 tbsp sugar and 2 tsp white wine vinegar, per pound of thin sliced beef 
Marinate over night. Thread beef on skewers, bbq. Stir fry veg in remaining sauce.

6737 2018-08-19 23:50:37 My one fear is that Carter actually failed due to oligarchy interference. I wouldn't consider it insane if someone suggested the CIA engineered the oil embargo and the Iran hostage situation. Coincidence they were released the exact day that Reagan took office?
6738 2018-08-19 23:50:24 Aye when they need to test sh*t like the Poll-Tax; park their nuclear subs n weapons; when they fleece us of ALL the resources from taxation to oil to water to electricity; to help pay for their illegal wars with men n women.... rest of time just fecking ignoring us!

6749 2018-08-19 23:48:33 I often think about what would have happened had I been the first lazy SOB to message companies saying “how many retweets for free shit”. How much money could I have saved on nuggets? Oil changes? TUITION?

6751 2018-08-19 23:48:15 I've been a Democrat for 40 years, problem is, we're a small minority in the oil/gas rich portion of NM.
We have to rely on the north part of the state.
They also have a larger population.
6752 2018-08-19 23:47:56 Ah the Texas pride in smelling oil from the oil rigs in Luling, TX
6753 2018-08-19 23:47:52 Haha oil firenado. Sharknado is original and awesome! #Sharknado4 #SharknadoSYFY
6754 2018-08-19 23:47:44 Damnit, why does Jalapeno oil have to secrete itself into your hands/fingers so when you wipe your forehead you set yourself on fire...

6757 2018-08-19 23:47:23 I Hope this physiological PAIN management is not directed towards people who need the sugar glycerine production boost from the pain medication in otherwords more body oil and not necessarily for pain that would be a sadistic thing to do to a person. Sanford hospital

6760 2018-08-19 23:46:59 Wasn't this article written before the sanctions?  Weisbrot's article may hold more water if there were no sanctions.  Currently, Venezuela cannot borrow and use oil as collateral.  There is no question that the sanctions have severe economic consequences for Venezuela.
6761 2018-08-19 23:46:45 I used ginger, garlic, soy sauce, honey, crushed pepper, olive oil, and like 2 pinches of sesame seed
6762 2018-08-19 23:46:38 It’s the little things that kyler has done for me all summer that i’m already missing. Like pumping my gas & getting me a blanket & putting oil in my diffuser.... SOS send help. I’m not ready to be independent

6779 2018-08-19 23:44:40 There are more serious internal and external issues that this government needs to deal with. NAFTA, US tariffs, international relationships, illegal border crossing, carbon tax, low Canadian dollars, marijuana, oil pipeline. Focus! Focus! No more parades and parties.
6780 2018-08-19 23:44:28 Our system makes suggestions on what our stories are about, with varying degrees of accuracy. I'm currently writing a column about #Broadway, and it suggests the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division.

6781 2018-08-19 23:44:27 I find it baffling that humans as a whole still prefer burning ancient remains and releasing toxic gasses into the sky over harnessing energy sources like the sun.

The plants and animals that died to make coal/oil originally got their energy from the sun.
6782 2018-08-19 23:44:11 Base EU foreign policy primarily on how corrupt the government is in a country. disengage on various levels on a scale basis with governments that are stealing from their people (grand corruption etc). Instead of military deals, raw national security interests, oil, trade etc.

6787 2018-08-19 23:43:28 This is a repugnant and anti-national thought to start with. When states get minerals from Bihar, oil from Assam at discounted national rate they don’t complain. Mughals in 1750s supposedly had 20+% of world GDP, that did not include south. Time north got its act straight.

6794 2018-08-19 23:42:34 I first purchased your products probably 5 years back, and since then I've really admired the way you run your business and how you (and Beardbrand) are as a company.  If it weren't for Beardbrand I don't think I'd have one, and I wouldn't be making my own oil!

6810 2018-08-19 23:38:30 Some greedy people exploited other for the oil. Agreed! And have created lots of problems! But, dont confuse those who’s God is Money/Power with those of us that are The children of Jesus and the Republic!

6821 2018-08-19 23:37:11 @bflay 
I have an idea!
Okay, most hot sauces are vinegar or oil based a lot right?
Well.... how about a hot sauce that is moonshine based.
U could even use bourbon or any other liquor and infuse it with different chillies--- which we all know you are a connoisseur of.

6829 2018-08-19 23:36:04 I got "you must be dying in that" a lot at #cltpride and while yeah even partial fursuits are hot damn have y'all never heard of peppermint oil?
6830 2018-08-19 23:35:59 Helped/assisted in being left behind as big oil & others just clutch their pearls harder in an effort to impeded investments, expansion & increase easy profits tied to old ways they have a strangle hold on. Clear as day and the gov should be a catalyst to renewals, not hinder it.
6831 2018-08-19 23:35:44 The externalities you describe represent a SMALL fraction of the externalities associated with JUST the delivery infrastructure for oil and gas (oil rigs, pipelines, tankers, trucks, refineries, gas stations, etc.), not to mention the fuel used for transporting oil and gas.

6837 2018-08-19 23:34:45 Only because they’re not smart enough to earn money without stealing. Where there’s money to share you will see Hausa man. Even Director if Nigeria Scrabble Club!!! For God’s sake! You don’t produce the oil but you want to control how it’s shared and how it’s utilised. IDIOT.

6848 2018-08-19 23:32:53 the thing is Jordan, OUR guys have the high Tech stuff as well and use it freely & we're still using coal & oil down here. It's not in the people's best interest to keep us living in the dark ages any longer.
6849 2018-08-19 23:32:50 @KCHairOil peppermint oil?? Oo la la!!
6850 2018-08-19 23:32:27 1. #MMT, Taxes and Inflation
Not all inflation is the same (cost push v demand pull). Taxes as a way to curb demand in the economy can deal with the latter. The former depends on the nature of the shock. Good example is oil crisis of 70's. There should have been a subsidy.

6886 2018-08-19 23:25:55 Why is it when oil prices rise, you see it at the pump within hours - but when oil prices fall, it may take a few weeks to see any effect at gas stations?

6891 2018-08-19 23:24:19 women unite! against Saudi, let's stop being dependant on their oil and use our own
6892 2018-08-19 23:24:12 The free market at work. Not saying im for or against but it is always an outcome . Never a shortage of snake oil salesmen in any market.
6893 2018-08-19 23:23:43 I'm all for solar plants, how will solar stop oil demand?
6894 2018-08-19 23:23:41 I haven't tried it, but this makes me wonder... have you guys tried it with coconut oil? I bet it's delicious :D

We do pretty much the same recipe but with sweet potato slices ahah
6895 2018-08-19 23:23:36 But there is one you can prevent.. #Nicaragua.. we are heading the same path.. faster and harder than Venezuela.. please help us.. we are desperate, but because we have no oil or natural resources to exploit, we are being ignored.
6896 2018-08-19 23:23:06 Did you listen to that #TaskForce interview with #FarmerJones i sent you? It gives a greater understanding about PTSD - and sheds light on why so many veterans are suffering - why suicide rates are so high - guarding poppyfields, oil fields and terrorists raping women & children
6897 2018-08-19 23:23:00   it's crazy what our so called beauty care stuff costs!  My nan swore by lard..but frankly even good lard is pricey... I suppose I could have stuck with the coconut oil but it does leave a rather shiny finish

6903 2018-08-19 23:22:20 The early utd years there was no competition bar maybe arsenal. Once the oil money came in it all changed. No champions league in 10 years. No league title in 5 tells you that picture is perfectly painted.

6905 2018-08-19 23:22:10 Hmmm, colloidal silver, oil of oregano or peppermint, clove, ginger, garlic and tumeric
6906 2018-08-19 23:22:05 Oil prices dropped $9.00 a barrle and gas stations in central PA still want $3.07/gal for regular! When is the price gaiging going to stop!

6910 2018-08-19 23:21:17 Jimmy Carter was the first President I ever voted for when he was the incumbent in 1980.  He was blamed for the oil crisis and mishandling of the Iran hostage crisis—although the prisoners were released the morning of Reagan’s swearing in.  I think he’s a great man.
6911 2018-08-19 23:21:11 That would be great!    I know I have the weirdest memories....but Kendra said it's not strawberry. She said....tigi dry shampoo and Jasmine oil and very sexy by vs.  I know....I don't know why I remember some of the shit I remember.

6923 2018-08-19 23:19:27 Proof of corruption?....just a little bit? Cause all hes proven to have done is lowered your taxes and hurt your feelings. Everything is speculation. Also, until 3000 Americans die to start an oil war under false pretences, you can't say his administration  is most corrupt lmao

6931 2018-08-19 23:18:45 Avocado is healthiest  than coconut oil.

Also these studies used refined fats (butter, coconut oil), complexed fats have differential effects.

6941 2018-08-19 23:17:41 Car wash and oil change. Extremely needed for Jess. Both were seriously over due!
6942 2018-08-19 23:17:36 Lay a cold, wet washcloth on your forehead, and if you have it, put peppermint oil on your temples. You should stay away from using electronics/ watching tv at all costs. It’s not fun but it SHOULD work. If you still have it exceeding 24-48 hours you may need to see a doctor.
6943 2018-08-19 23:17:27 CBD oil doesn't have any of the psychoactive cons of marijuana, but all the benefits.

6955 2018-08-19 23:15:33 The oil companies refine 83-85 octane gasoline. Ethanol replaced MTBE as an oxygenate and octane booster. Your car warranty says you have to use 87 octane. Ethanol is a cheap and non toxic way to boost the octane in the subgrade gasoline that is being refined. Look up MTBE!

6962 2018-08-19 23:14:47 I had some stuff the pharmacy gave me and it worked for a while but it’s now stopped  I use a Simple Oil Rebalance face wash and then a tea tree based moisturiser but again, that seems to have stopped working too 
6963 2018-08-19 23:14:46 I am sick of the death grip big oil has upon our country & the world. Big oil is the reason for our wars, and it is destroying our air, water& total environment. Our most precious resource is clean water, but I don’t hear anyone talking about a looming crisis. Why?
6964 2018-08-19 23:14:30 I had so many sick pieces. Had a painting of James Marsdens cyclops from the 1st X-Men film, the piece I spoke about 1st was a oil pastel drawing of some girl looking at a castle. All gone 
6965 2018-08-19 23:14:26 Read the statement-renewable is Bullshit-whether it's coal ,solar or wind-once a Kilowatt is produced and used it's SPENT-Windfarms and solar panels have a definite lifespan-once that is reached all that platsic ,gearbox oil , other parts need to be recycled-JUST BURN CLEAN COAL
6966 2018-08-19 23:14:18 The smell of Olbas Oil is deeply comforting. I want to build a house out of it

6968 2018-08-19 23:13:54 Absolutely criminal. Frying without oil is like driving without tires.

6993 2018-08-19 23:08:39 Yup, we should be muzzled by the Saudis. I don't think so. We don't need to purchase their oil. The two refineries in Atlantic Canada have options. As for the vehicles, we're stuck with that contract thanks to the Conservatives. And, if they want to sell their stake in G3...

7015 2018-08-19 23:03:39 La Agencia Internacional de la Energía (AIE) evita utilizar la expresión 《Extracción de Petróleo》 y la reemplaza por 《producción de Petróleo》 para camuflar el peak oil. Se debe a que el P. convencional disminuye y lo releva los derivados que son producidos artificialmente.
7016 2018-08-19 23:03:37 You have to CHANGE the oil?!

7024 2018-08-19 23:02:36 For Buhari to show that he is serious about jailing corrupt people,  let him jail himself first...  Or has he returned the N2.8bn oil money?
7025 2018-08-19 23:02:19 Hi ii'm Earth.
WTF is your problem..

Use Bicycles and leave oil alone.
7026 2018-08-19 23:02:13 I know. Principles are the same in most industries. I was a reliability engineer in the oil and gas industry. Anyway, nice chatting. I've finished my Taketsuru nightcap and must go to bed.
7027 2018-08-19 23:02:12 @ClemensZsofia Hi I follow your paleo keto advice and eat all beef diet with good results but I respond well to extra MCT oil daily which gives more energy, better mood, and mental clarity than all-meat diet alone (even with extra fat trimmings to increase fat intake)
7028 2018-08-19 23:01:52 I removed my lash extensions a couple days ago & my real ones are already growing super quick! Vaseline & castor oil ladies!
7029 2018-08-19 23:01:45 Problem is football is such a good sport. It's like chess but with violent collisions that give players CTE. Plus I'd feel hypocritical giving it up to appear woke then replacing it w/ a world cup that was literally built w/ slave labor or club soccer funded by Saudi oil money
7030 2018-08-19 23:01:41 Venezuela is in dire straits because of economic warfare and the oil dilemma. We still expect to see either an invasion of Venezuela or attack by western puppet nation - Columbia.
7031 2018-08-19 23:01:39 my car has a stupid alarm that only I know how to work and i came to get an oil change and the guy keeps on setting it off 
7032 2018-08-19 23:01:20 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
7033 2018-08-19 23:01:15 The cat will eat the human style canned tuna in oil. She will not eat the tuna for cats. So frustrating. My dog eats every meal I give her. The cat drives me nuts.
7034 2018-08-19 23:01:10 No I'm not buying it!  Trump is s snake oil salesmen and he is selling tubs full.  Truth isn't truth?  Are u f'ing kidding me!?
7035 2018-08-19 23:00:59 QUICK: what stores are open today that sell *decent paint markers!? all my sharpies died :(

*ones that can write thin-ish over top of acrylic/oil paints
7036 2018-08-19 23:00:41 Perhaps the only good that derived from Iranian oil find was the accelerated independence of India.  Even that was mismanaged,  breaking up the subcontinent and leaving Kashmir in shambles.
7037 2018-08-19 23:00:37 I KNOW THIS GUY WHO KNOWS the snake oil salesman WHO SAYS THAT Vulcans ARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!

7040 2018-08-19 23:00:27 Trump could have "sorted out Saudi Arabia" because he does not agree to their practices. Oil has ruined those people but they have money because of oil and the $350 bn worth of orders through Trump changed his attitude towards the country which has serious gender inequality.
7041 2018-08-19 23:00:13 Did you bother to read the article you posted? The largest component of the price increases was gas. Trump doesn't control that. There are many oil producing countries in the world that influence the price of oil/gas.

7047 2018-08-19 22:59:07 In Brazil the base gasoline is 27% ethanol and this motor runs great there too!  They box them up and ship them to Brazil with no changes.  The same exact motor. Don’t be fooled by the oil mongers!
7048 2018-08-19 22:59:02 Me: mom I got a tattoo
Mom: well atleast you didn’t dump us all in a oil tank and kill us. That might have been better. 

FUCKING DRAMATIC
7049 2018-08-19 22:58:47 I had a Jimmy John’s #12 unwich with onions and extra mayo for my meal today... one of my favorite low carb sandwiches!  I also had my MCT oil latte, some almonds and 2 bb bell cheeses. Let’s see if I lose weight tomorrow! This morning I was the same as yesterday 
7050 2018-08-19 22:58:43 Part of the West's 'black ops' campaign involved spreading false rumours that Mosaddegh drank alcohol and was a homosexual, to undermine his support amongst the Iranian people.

There are no depths too low where oil's concerned.

7059 2018-08-19 22:57:32 I was wondering when Will send his 'Aloha' tweet if you were there. 
7060 2018-08-19 22:57:30 Turkeys role in selling isis oil to sell cheaply to israel. The truth is there if you dont rely on rte, bbc, cnn etc. All arms found in liberated areas from isis are either US, uk or Israeli made. White helmets are uk propaganda arm
7061 2018-08-19 22:57:22 But the tax cuts to the big corporations are among the biggest winners. Corporate executives have reaped gains as their companies bought back record amounts of stock, and, as you know, that rewards shareholders by boosting the value of existing shares.

Oil prices up!
7062 2018-08-19 22:57:19 Bob Vance bought me some beard oil. It’s also made from pine.
7063 2018-08-19 22:57:04 I’m three days into a planned month-long keto stretch and let me say this: it feels terrible and I kind of want to chug olive oil?
7064 2018-08-19 22:57:00 ㅎ핸드폰 충전 안됬어...
7065 2018-08-19 22:56:57 M9: flour offerings are often mixed with oil and frankincense but what if they are mixed outside of the Temple? Because it need not be mixed by a kohen, one rabbi permits it, but animal sacrifices need not be done by a Kohen but must be done on the Temple.
7066 2018-08-19 22:56:39 I just did this on Friday, too! Added too much oil so the larger pieces were a bit soggy, but when they come out right.....mmmmm
7067 2018-08-19 22:56:36 Im thinking of trying CBD oil as a substitute for smoking weed. Anyone done this transition yet? Thoughts, experiences? #CBDoil

7070 2018-08-19 22:56:20 The latest episode of @RFRadioPrairie is out talking about employment in the oil sands and the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project. Super thankful to Dr. Angele Alook and Farid Iskandar for these important conversations.#yyc #ableg #abpoli #cdnpoli #canlab #yeg
7071 2018-08-19 22:56:18 Tesla (Elon) is destroying ITSELF. 

We are just betting that they will succeed.

Big oil has NOTHING to do with $tsla, or their problems. 

NOBODY has to pay short sellers to bet against this company.
7072 2018-08-19 22:56:00 Oil job…  no bitch will come from no where and enjoy those things his gonna acquire,  lets just say shes protecting her future #savage.
7073 2018-08-19 22:55:49 You have not been polite at all. Firstly you tweeted me (rather passively aggressively) when I merely stated Scotland generates billions in income from oil ever year. I didn’t even mention independence. But we will leave it there cause you are clearly getting flustered. Take Care
7074 2018-08-19 22:55:36 Has anyone found #FentyBeauty foundation broke out their skin? I loved it when I first used it last fall, and don't even use powder anymore but, since this summer + the heat and more skin oil I have been breaking out non-stop. Might this be part of it? Anyone else???
7075 2018-08-19 22:55:27 @JasonJHunter Hi Jason, I tweeted about the fact that we can't import oil post no-deal Brexit. How long could it take to set up a bi-lateral deal with a producer post Brexit so we could ensure supply? I commute by car 400 miles a week so should I move?
7076 2018-08-19 22:55:10 I packed everything except for my will to apply tanning oil every two hours.

Also missing, my will to get dressed.
7077 2018-08-19 22:54:44 Oil on water is probably the most underrated song on Wild World
7078 2018-08-19 22:54:34 Nope straight lemon juice in a spray bottle. Spritz my hair at night before I put my scarf on. I noticed the top of my hair (which was VERY slow locking) start locking faster. I did it every couple days and put coconut oil on my hair when it felt alil dry
7079 2018-08-19 22:54:33 Jeb Clampett made claim to oil he discovered and patented Grannies Lye soap and moonshine.  The extent of my knowledge on patent law.
7080 2018-08-19 22:54:22 An air travellers association should be formed, they should demand 1. Reasonable leg room. 2. This should not mean airlines should increase their fares. 3. Oil prices have dropped significantly passengers should be allowed increase in luggage weight
7081 2018-08-19 22:54:12 coconut oil is the best thing that ever happened to my hair im welcome
7082 2018-08-19 22:54:00 I  orangutans. They are super intelligent & have 97% of our genetic makeup which is very special. One way we can help them out is to reduce our consumption of palm oil &/or make sure any palm oil we do consume is from sustainable sources. #InternationalOrangutanDay
7083 2018-08-19 22:53:54 Salas was leaking major oil until that terrific wedge from the deep rough on the 18th. Clutch city.
7084 2018-08-19 22:53:41 Nope! Fessy is not looking out for Haleigh’s best interest. If he was, Angela, KC and Sam would’ve been nomed this week instead he noms the two guys that will never put Haleigh up. Fessy is sleazy oil sales man. He wants Haleigh to hurt and come to him for comfort. #bb20
7085 2018-08-19 22:53:21 Jordan Peterson is a snake oil salesman.
7086 2018-08-19 22:53:21 With all of that, is he at least cute? I mean up close cute and not an oil painting far away cute.
7087 2018-08-19 22:53:21 4; A good tip is use an old mascara brush (wash it off very good) then use that to put the oil on your lashes

5; Green tea also works very well. Get a cotton swab dip it in green tea then cover your lashes with it. Make sure to wash off in the morning.
7088 2018-08-19 22:53:18 @JimSpenceSport AW  Jesus, does that mean that we Scots will have to give up our Deep Fried Mars Bars & Mr Singh's Haggis Pakoras & Split Black Pudding Suppers ?Not to mention England's  appropriation of Scottish Oil & Elgin Marbles !What a Jerk you are Dawn !
7089 2018-08-19 22:53:06 Falwell is not a “preacher.” He is a snake oil salesman who has a tax-free income.

7098 2018-08-19 22:51:32 Motivation for Russian association could be just plain greed, not kompromat. Politicians also hang out with oil and IT executives. The Russians could just be another donor group for some GOP.
7099 2018-08-19 22:51:22 the fact that a country highly depend on oil is doing this is a just an example of #peakoil ...... by the way its has nothing to with running out of oil
7100 2018-08-19 22:51:12 Do you deny that Shorts are trying to destroy Tesla so they can profit?
Do you deny that there's Big oil behind this?
7101 2018-08-19 22:51:08 She tried coconut oil. Shes gonna try baby oil next. Thank you for responding 
7102 2018-08-19 22:51:04 Venezuela's socialism was based on the high price of oil exported to rest of world. When the price fell less $ could go to poor people. So socialism based on capitalism is a house of cards.
7103 2018-08-19 22:51:01 We all know this is fake News!  Oil prices are set off shore and also reflect strong US dollar/weak Cdn $  #canpoli

7105 2018-08-19 22:50:52 1; Remove make up properly before going to bed. It can cause lash loss of you don’t 

2;Avoid rubbing your eyes! Especially during allergy season

3;Add oil to your lashes like, olive oil, castor oil, coconut oil and vaseline before going to bed. This will increase volume

7107 2018-08-19 22:50:49 yeah they're ALWAYS OUT of it and coconut oil but it's in high demand. I find other local sources. Even the jelly man on the street side will fill your jug for you

7150 2018-08-19 22:43:29 Thank you @JoesPizzaPhilly for the Saint Lucifer habanero olive oil!  Sto pagando le conseguenze!! 
7151 2018-08-19 22:42:58 Please exit my life if you call olive oil EVOO.
7152 2018-08-19 22:42:53 He blocked me years ago because I tagged him in sharing a comment he made about Oil Man's design only being racist if you are racist so I have no idea what is going on here.
7153 2018-08-19 22:42:32 "Oil? Not yet. I want to relax a bit before we get to the fun stuff."

Angela sips the last of her drink — she basically drank the whole thing in three drinks — before setting the glass aside and stretching on the chair.

7159 2018-08-19 22:41:40 Looks tasty tell him from chef to chef... how do you have it butter or olive oil with a hint of balsamic?
7160 2018-08-19 22:41:13 Like everyone else says it probably a/c condensation. Antifreeze will be green/red/orange and smell sweet. Oil will smell like oil.
7161 2018-08-19 22:41:05 There's a neon sign in the middle of this oil field, but I 100% thought it was a red balloon for a second, and I was about to just be completely done with this area of the world

7167 2018-08-19 22:40:12 Let’s see - Saudi has caused instability and pain in the Middle East (Yemen, Qatar, Iran, etc.), and human right violations especially against women but the world does nothing. The power of money and oil puts you above international law I guess.
7168 2018-08-19 22:40:11 Just took my glasses off to view the oil paintings... Even more unrecognizable. Am definitely more myopic than this.

7173 2018-08-19 22:39:07 The erudite & highly cerebral Professor Wole Soyinka was credited with a statement where he accused OBJ for giving out an oil block in payment for sex.

Hmmmn. If this is true,may I not have a friend like distinguished Professor who would spill your mess under whatever guise. No.
7174 2018-08-19 22:39:06 It sounds terrible from the beginning. The oil belongs to the people who actually get it, not to everyone who feels they should have it.
7175 2018-08-19 22:39:04 I always check the ingredients. If a product contains palm oil i don't buy it.
7176 2018-08-19 22:39:03 Bought eggs, a glass jar of sauce and a massive glass bottle of olive oil in the same grocery trip. I am truly living on the edge
7177 2018-08-19 22:38:54 Just search for #grandsolarminimum, #globalcooling and #miniiceage some people believe scammers saying the globe is in an ice age. I guess the internet makes selling snake oil easy by providing such a huge audience some of which can be sucked in.
7178 2018-08-19 22:38:51 The healthiest of foods are whole food plant-based with no added oil. This has been proven for decades but the MSM won't report it, and instead use flawed ondustry studies as click bait. Remember butter?

7180 2018-08-19 22:38:36 Had a water melon candle & oil burner on in my room tonight and I’ve just came in to go to bed and it smells amaaaazin 
7181 2018-08-19 22:38:35 Yeah the Shea butter is thicker than coconut oil, it's awesome. Hope it works out for you!
7182 2018-08-19 22:38:30 Well I have no doubt you will achieve you goal. Our body has an endocannabinoid system basically cbd & thc found in cannabis are found in our body. Hemp seed oil is full of amino acids and also a good dietary supplement. Our endocannabinoid system is our bodies echo system.

7185 2018-08-19 22:38:08 I agree 115%. Just saying big oil controls all.

7191 2018-08-19 22:37:11 Also I'm sure you already know this, but research before you use it with any condoms/toys. Most aren't safe for use with oil. If you use a lot be mindful of getting oil stains on your sheets as well, but overall it's pretty fun and def provides more sensation than water-based.

7202 2018-08-19 22:35:03 i believe it’s because of the United States interest in #oil. Saudi Arabia partnerships with Israel via ExxonMobil

WOW. 
If you are wanting to try our oil but nervous about passing a drug test then this is what you need. 
 Any questions just ask :D thanks :)
7204 2018-08-19 22:34:17 Don’t leave off the Insurers and Big Pharma, Medical Devise companies, Fossil Fuel (which the Democrats just agreed that they will reverse the ban and allow Big Oil donations). Disgraceful.

7206 2018-08-19 22:34:07 Am I understanding the issue correctly: Browder's  Russian partner told Putin he would pay taxes on profit from oil company. He did not pay. Russia went after the tax money and found it in Cyprus and seized it for Russia. This ticked off American shareholders due to losing money.

7211 2018-08-19 22:33:11 Friend, can you tell me what, what made the world what it is, was it invented by Muslims? The only thing you have is oil, but if we were not industrialized countries  to find out how to use it, you would not have done anything. Calm and plaster. Please.
7212 2018-08-19 22:33:01 I miss those BoA’s. The BoA’s were still good when the Flames had Iggy (the only Flame I ever liked unless he was playing against the Oil). But ever since he left CGY the BoA’s have been lacklustre. Although I do like how we have laid the boots to them these past couple years.
7213 2018-08-19 22:33:00 What if the "dick pic" is an actual oil painting? It is still crass, but I'd have to give a little credit for effort.
7214 2018-08-19 22:32:47 I agree 100%. The beneficial effect of fish oil was a valid and important hypothesis. I, too, spent thousands of hours testing it, and I sympathize with those who find its failure hard to take. But in the end, science is about truth, not about comfort.

7218 2018-08-19 22:31:42 I've had a good experience with it. It's not nearly as slippery as water-based lubes but it won't dry out, doesn't get sticky, and it protects your skin more than water or silicone based ones would. I like mixing coconut oil and pure Shea butter personally.
7219 2018-08-19 22:31:31 I was talking about THIS particular report, which is written in language that is beyond most people. It is also one person’s (a geologist) observations...who also works for the oil industry.

7252 2018-08-19 22:27:06 But again, the specific terms for each Company in the O&G sector may vary slightly and since government may not always pay its stake when called for, this further complicates the analysis. I have put together two simplified computations of Nigeria's 2015 Oil Revenues

7261 2018-08-19 22:25:58 There are other issues that impact gas prices like constraints on refining capacity.  Oil and gas prices not strongly correlated in the short term.

7264 2018-08-19 22:25:35 there are a few foundations out there that are trash, this is not one of them. even with my oily skin I found using the wake and bake oil balanced my skin out and worked great with this. Also made it easy to blend, I wouldn’t suggest using a matte primer with this formula
7265 2018-08-19 22:25:27 Too bad she probably smells like oil and sweat 90% of the time 
7266 2018-08-19 22:25:22 Tak. Sy belum try lagi oil cleanser. For now guna micellar water je dulu. Nak try yang hada labo oil cleanser nanti. 
7267 2018-08-19 22:25:20 i did a coconut oil mask on my hair and it actually washed out of my hair and it is SO DANG SOFT
7268 2018-08-19 22:25:03 Even Govt Take is pretty confusing, because it varies significanly on the Fiscal Regime chosen by a country. Is the government fully participating in the oil and gas value chain and taking its share of the risks. the common Fiscal Regimes in Nigeria are PSC and JV
7269 2018-08-19 22:24:32 My doctor gave me some stuff, but mostly I use the Neutrogena visibly clear spot proofing daily wash, and the oil free moisturiser. It works for me really well

7272 2018-08-19 22:24:07 Hey @OklahomaFreedom , I finished your beard oil, and it smells like pipe tobacco, a shot of whiskey and patriotism.
7273 2018-08-19 22:23:57 Oil slick, ice, snow, meat, sand, gravel. Guess ice would be slipperiest.

7278 2018-08-19 22:23:13 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Ghana and Nigeria are selling coconut oil ?
7279 2018-08-19 22:23:06 Oil and gas Revenues in Nigeria is a mystery at times. We need to properly define what we mean by revenue. Is it total revenue accruing the sector (Avg Crude oil price x total Production), or the governments Share of it (usually called Govt Take.
7280 2018-08-19 22:22:59 I also put chocolate chips in them. And dipped them in chocolate with coconut oil. Once cooled in the fridge, the coconut oil makes it harden really fast.
7281 2018-08-19 22:21:55 What worked for me may not work for you. I grated an onion and sieved the juice and applied it to my problem areas about 2 hours before washing my hair with gentle magic soap bar then applied Castor oil(abt once a week). I also stopped plaiting while waiting for it to recover.
7282 2018-08-19 22:21:45 If I wasn't doing a speed run I'd sit and wait for it to pass. If I was doing a speed run I'd memorise the track so it wouldn't matter.

Though this has reminded me of oil slicks, that might be a fun surface to drive on.

7285 2018-08-19 22:21:04 In a past life I was Banquet Manager. Trust me when I say they probably put an unreasonable amount of oil in the gravy to make it flow like that 
7286 2018-08-19 22:21:03 great job @JackieFricke  We cant wait to see you at Maple Grove!!!
7287 2018-08-19 22:21:00 When are kale eaters going to admit it is one of the lousiest tasting greens. Might be edible if you were to massage it with oil, break it down, saute, and then cover it with a lot of freshly crumbled bacon. Might be, I said, even bacon doesn't cure everything.
7288 2018-08-19 22:20:52 I have brownie mix but no weed oil 
7289 2018-08-19 22:20:49 Franklin is a snake oil salesmen that doesnt develop talent
7290 2018-08-19 22:20:47 He’s an evil monster. After murdering his 2 kids, he put them in a vat of oil at his place of employment!
7291 2018-08-19 22:20:33 I think that oil of Olay made be made from bullfighters

7296 2018-08-19 22:20:03 I have a oil diffuser but I also just put a little on my finger and put right under my nose so that I’m smelling it. I’d highly recommend googling different ways to use oils. There are a bunch of ways.

7298 2018-08-19 22:19:53 Oil, pesticides, herbicides, runoff from rivers feeding the delta.  All killing it.
7299 2018-08-19 22:19:36 You know for those who have seen evangellion, there is a scene where the protag has a fisheye lens on his face, capturing his term oil in a perticular moment. I think of Matt in that context now.
7300 2018-08-19 22:19:33 Exactly the one person they trusted to protect them. He was their daddy  killing someone who loves & trusts you is sick but killing two little lives you created takes evil i could never understand. Then to place them in OIL!!! I want to seriously hurt this creature
7301 2018-08-19 22:19:30 I just made homemade potato chips that I tossed in olive oil and Cajun seasoning and baked. I may not ever eat store-bought again 
7302 2018-08-19 22:19:30 What happened now? Let me guess you stuck oil and are moving to Beverly Hills.
7303 2018-08-19 22:19:29 (1/2) If Coca Cola can be used to clean car oil spills and rust stains, then why are we still drinking soda? I never drank it as a child - my parents didn't either - and I think I'm healthier because of that (not that I don't have other bad eating habits). Nonetheless, we should

7305 2018-08-19 22:19:10 I hear you.  He also ran into some ethical issues with Vandy.  He's a bit of a snake oil salesmen imo.  Taggart on the other hand, man, he is going to be a smoke show in Tally.
7306 2018-08-19 22:19:03 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
7307 2018-08-19 22:18:58 Trying to think of those things that float. Wood. Fluff. Oil slick. Fat. Turds.

Not much to be considered worthy!
7308 2018-08-19 22:18:36 You could always use the cherry tomatoes in a chicken dish! Cut em in half, salt pepper olive oil everything and roast it on a cookie sheet! Serve with some pasta!

7315 2018-08-19 22:18:02 where i can get some more oil for my pen from lol or i gotta get a whole new one
7316 2018-08-19 22:17:55 Take out $NFLX, put in $MSFT, and you have the "Cloud Czars," the companies that today dominate the global economy like the oil giants of old.

They are telephony. They are TV.

7318 2018-08-19 22:17:36 Was just me and momma traveling from NH toCT to visit Grammie and Poppy. My mom had no-zero sense of direction.   Over nine years, I used to tell folks I can’t get lost in MA.  I’ve been lost on every fucking road in MA!  I changed tires, she added oil.  Worst, she would not hear

whatever that film is made out of sucks. super thin and bubbles easily compared to some newer films Ive used.
7322 2018-08-19 22:17:18 Ahh, Obama blocked the Dakota pipeline.Then there was O’s fracking rule that Trump rescinded. Oh & Obama permanently banned offshore oil & gas drilling in 100’s of millions of acres. He told us in his book, he wasn’t a savior. He is a pragmatist. I’d take him back in a heartbeat.
7323 2018-08-19 22:16:31 The US support for KSA makes travesty of American ideals.  There should be a reckoning with it despite all the oil.  I wonder whether oil was not a gift for Islam, but rather a curse.  Same for Russia.  Feeds corruption, stalls progress.
7324 2018-08-19 22:16:30 Good ole oil in the system 
7325 2018-08-19 22:16:17 Oil
7326 2018-08-19 22:15:55 This is not bread! Bread is made of flour and water. Yeast, salt and olive oil are optional.
7327 2018-08-19 22:15:52 And how did that week coalition managed rupee falling / prices in times of global crisis $120+ crude oil. While the single party got us record rupee low & high commodity prices while crude was record low? 

And if recent news to be believed record GDP too?

7334 2018-08-19 22:15:03 It starts on one lil tip of you finger then a couple hours later it’s your whole had. I had to put them in milk and rubbed olive oil all over them like four times. I thought I was gunna have to go to the emergency room.
7335 2018-08-19 22:14:55 Oregano oil has been a game changer for me.

7339 2018-08-19 22:14:32 Kale is yummy if you do a light coating of olive oil and sprinkle it with seasoned salt and bake until is crispy. It's like healthy potato chips.
7340 2018-08-19 22:14:23 Burning oil to generate electricity in big engines is usually more efficient.. so say my fellow electrical engineers

7342 2018-08-19 22:13:56 WTF, all ready changing the plan... I’ll give you a 5% head start in the wheat @RealBrianWatt ! ;)

You know we produce oil in Canada too right?? No chance of even being in the top 10  if you switch this
7343 2018-08-19 22:13:35 Nail oil and time
7344 2018-08-19 22:13:26 my gran uses salt and olive oil and chants something inaudible and all of a sudden the headache and drowsiness is gone
7345 2018-08-19 22:13:25 Hotels don’t generally stock oil... maybe they should.
7346 2018-08-19 22:13:03 3/ I don't want those nasty, ugly oil rigs set up off our beautiful coastline!!! Most people don't. And we don't want the spills and accidents. Our best course is to ramp up the next generation energy sources and transition away from fossil fuels. Using multiple sources.
7347 2018-08-19 22:13:01 I just wanna smack this bass player hands with some holy oil so he can find Jesus in his playing
7348 2018-08-19 22:12:27 I’m convinced foundation sticks aren’t oily skin friendly cus I look like an oil slick 
7349 2018-08-19 22:12:18 Oil companies love Rudy Giuliani because he distracts from Climate change while helping them profit from their stocks in major news corporations.
7350 2018-08-19 22:12:17 Most Ministers especially Evagelicals are con men and snake oil salesmen.

7352 2018-08-19 22:11:45 I usually argue that most concerns about GMO safety apply generallly to most industrial ag practices. Rising pesticide use, heavy fertilizer use, land erosion, oil use,etc. Unfortunately, we’re stuck with all that if we don’t change eating habits and shrink human population size.
7353 2018-08-19 22:11:40 You are so right. We won't have a culture or country come 10-20 yr our leaders have done this all for Saudi oil money  its criminal.
7354 2018-08-19 22:11:39 Dems could careless about Middle Class, Poor, violence, poverty, #VeteranSuicide suicides, healthcare, homelessness, low wages....they do love them some War, Big Oil and Tax cuts for Billionaires...same exact things GOP loves...owned the exact same lobbyist.

7356 2018-08-19 22:11:24 Love the oil & the white background!

7359 2018-08-19 22:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: spicy crust with stale motor oil and apple wood smoked bacon.
7360 2018-08-19 22:11:01 United States has essentially caused mayhem in the entire civilized world with their genocidal illegal wars for the control of oil.
7361 2018-08-19 22:11:01 #coal jobs have been going away for over a century, it began when ships started burning diesel not coal, went on through diesel trains, the change from surface to air travel, homes changing to oil, gas and now renewables. Coal is as dead as whale oil.
7362 2018-08-19 22:10:30 Venezuela relied on oil and the resulting oil boom too much instead of diversifying their economy for long term growth

7364 2018-08-19 22:10:18 My inner organic, suburban mom always come out when I clean. How many other 17 year olds get excited over lemon oil brightening old wood?!?!?
7365 2018-08-19 22:10:17 Lol idk why I think when I put growth oil in my hair after I get it braided it’s gonna grow tomorrow so it won’t be sooo tight
7366 2018-08-19 22:10:14 2/ Of 198 brrls discovered & listed as "possibly" recoverable, 50% is "unconventional" (mostly shale oil and tar sands) which costs more to extract and refine. Prices have to stay at $60 or above ($80+ for tarsnds) per brrl to sustain oil biz. We NEED to transition to renewables

7368 2018-08-19 22:10:05 RT @LivingSafely: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this August? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!
7369 2018-08-19 22:10:04 I go back home
and dinner is an omelette of oil
and I felt that I had to join since I have been away
my new pajama got full of oil
after dinner I was in the bathroom trying to clean it and there is a huge bug in my room
not very welcoming but ok 
used to this
7370 2018-08-19 22:09:57 “Cool. I’ll see you in a bit.”

He says and stands, making his way back to his truck and gives the male a final wave with his oil covered hand from the recent boat job he’s done.
7371 2018-08-19 22:09:56 They both would die to make more oil?
7372 2018-08-19 22:09:34 Grind ginger+ squeezed lemon+honey & garlic(if you can). Very effective. Steaming is also effective with a few drops of eucalyptus oil (silverbird). You can find it in most pharmacies. Get well soon
7373 2018-08-19 22:09:24 I did a cheap argan oil/açaí/rose hip mud mask earlier and my skin feels much better than it has been the past week or so.
7374 2018-08-19 22:08:52 I just made DIY makeup remover with witch hazel, fractionated coconut oil, geranium and frankincense essential oils from doTERRA. I may not wait until tonight to use it. 
7375 2018-08-19 22:08:40 My wife does it all the time too...
It usually involves kale and kohlrabi...
I use coconut oil with it not because it improved the flavor, but comes right off the plate when I scrape it in the garbage...
7376 2018-08-19 22:08:37 Also hopes that Oil of Olay hasn’t been rebranded, giving away real age, like knowing words to Neil Sedaka.
7377 2018-08-19 22:08:37 You can hear his bones squeakin when he walks dude needs an oil change
7378 2018-08-19 22:08:20 I always thought Daryl would smell like gasoline or car oil. Negan would smell like old leather and cheap cologne.
7379 2018-08-19 22:08:12 my hands are so soft today because i accidentally spilled an entire bottle of olive oil on them last night. take notes, ladies.
7380 2018-08-19 22:08:07 おはようございます。腹痛治らん(´･ω･｀)
7381 2018-08-19 22:07:59 i'm about to buy the entire moroccan oil hair and body line because it's all i want to smell like
7382 2018-08-19 22:07:51 It’s the Oil for me but I know what you mean. That’s the ear worm when you’re stood on it.
7383 2018-08-19 22:07:50 I want to get braids and keep getting them until November so I can consistently oil my scalp
7384 2018-08-19 22:07:46 Tell me about it. I’ve not known people to administer cannabis to kids in any other form except oil, legally or otherwise. Especially for seizures.
7385 2018-08-19 22:07:44 Borage oil?! WHY?!
7386 2018-08-19 22:07:43 Good they are a 2 facetedvcountry the Whannabi Muslims still hold power but on the surface act like any normal country. Far from. We are not allowed to go into their country except oil workers who stay within their compounds. Outside those walls is most likely a nightmare
7387 2018-08-19 22:07:35 Are you going to do without Scotland's oil, Scotland's Electricity and Scotland's water, currently pouring down south as we speak?
7388 2018-08-19 22:07:31 Thanks Ali, I’m hoping it’s just my normal insane reaction to mosquito - it’s like the only area to which I didn’t apply repellent. Plus good excuse to avoid laptop /work lol. I may have some lavender oil goat milk soap in my vanity…I have not heard of this remedy tell me more!
7389 2018-08-19 22:07:09 The English government are never gonna let us go independent, they lose us they lose the money they make from our oil.
7390 2018-08-19 22:07:04 Trump is avoiding Mueller like a 7 year old avoiding a dose of cod liver oil 
7391 2018-08-19 22:06:50 The problem is that the stuff is in so many types of product, not just food items. It shouldn't be labelled as Vegetable Oil but sometimes is, so is difficult to spot. And sadly, it's highly profitable #PalmOil
7392 2018-08-19 22:06:43 Sometimes I make my own cream of asparagus soup (sautéed in sesame oil) and I think “WHO AM I”? But then I add bacon, and I think, “phew! It’s still me!”
7393 2018-08-19 22:06:25 わかりすぎるRT
7394 2018-08-19 22:06:08 it's so weird to me that some people don't like the taste of sesame oil like that's FLAVOR you fool
7395 2018-08-19 22:06:04 I’m going to go with ‘yes’ for this one too, hides the Oil of Olay ;)
7396 2018-08-19 22:05:55 It was all going so well until we spilled tonnes of oil
7397 2018-08-19 22:05:47 Attlee was no socialist.He connived at the overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian government,because it had nationalised oil.Churchill finished the job. 
He"nationalised"bankrupt industries only,with LAVISH compensation 4 their rich owners.There was no working/c control.
7398 2018-08-19 22:05:41 Darcey & Jesse are like oil and water, they don’t mix and I’m not seeing them workout. #90dayfiance #beforethe90dsys
7399 2018-08-19 22:05:34 Great question, you are asking the wrong person though. Much like the history of this country, I have no control over where gigantic oil companies put their pipes. Maybe you should vote for me in the next election.
7400 2018-08-19 22:05:30 Talk about divorced from reality?  Who do these leftists think gross their food?  Who do they think pumps the oil, refines it, runs the power grid, provides water?  California? Silicon Valley?
Hahahahaha! Morons! You’d starve in 3 days.  Your inner city gangs would be raping you!
7401 2018-08-19 22:05:23 Gibberish! Are windmills killing birds or birds killing windmills? (If he cares abt wildlife, he should protect animals.) Doubt there are windmills in the Sargasso Sea. Is he trying to say “subsidies for turbines”? He also left out peat bogs, whale oil, kerosene & some verbs.
7402 2018-08-19 22:04:58 Want brownies. Realized I have no oil. 
7403 2018-08-19 22:04:56 I I just opened a fresh jar of olive oil miracle whip, mayoed up some buns and had some burgers last night. topped with roasted spinach.

yum

but i left the cap off, and the miracle whip stayed out all night.

so am i going to die if i eat this now?
7404 2018-08-19 22:04:52 @nicolesnowxo Let the oil come out to play tonight 
7405 2018-08-19 22:04:50 Yo did you not look at the bottles of moroccan oil shampoo? They literally say color-safe.
7406 2018-08-19 22:04:48  Not disappointed in them at all. They know how much oil & gas will try to spend to defeat them if they endorse and we, the people, will pass it regardless of endorsements and they won’t overturn it when they win. It’s a pretty easy concept. I’ll even donate to their campaign

I think there is a You Tube feature showing how to do it.
7414 2018-08-19 22:03:37 It is not true, as a petroleum engineer I am confident in my words. Refinery it is a good business, even if we have to buy oil. More questions please contact me luisjcelis@gmail.com
7415 2018-08-19 22:03:36 Oyyyyy I’m sooo sorry. do you have any lavender essential oil?
7416 2018-08-19 22:03:22 I'd keep it dry. Coconut oil will clog the pores more.

7420 2018-08-19 22:02:45 Oil rigs and gasoline industry.
7421 2018-08-19 22:02:41 Clueless politicians/civil servants strike again. Wet wood doesn't burn, so one buys it wet, then allows it to dry before burning it. It's much better than oil or gas - the recycling of "wet wood" means less "old" CO2 is brought back into play, so overall better for the planet...

7427 2018-08-19 22:02:20 It's only viable above a certain value of oil per barrel, its massively politically unpopular and it's against the spirit of the Paris agreement. The next Labour government will kick it into touch, so why not ditch it now before the investors loose all thier money?
7428 2018-08-19 22:02:16 Except we didn't get any oil. If we took the oil, I would have been OK with it.
7429 2018-08-19 22:02:01 I’ve been using coconut oil and it helps but obviously it just goes away. I’ll have to use the oatmeal soaks. Please tell me it goes away after baby comes out...
7430 2018-08-19 22:01:59 Then they can drill for oil there, and mine coal! LOL!
7431 2018-08-19 22:01:50 Coconut oil

7433 2018-08-19 22:01:41 I need a full body massage with hot oil ASAP.
7434 2018-08-19 22:01:32 So, conserving oil is no longer imperative according to the the Trump administration. I swear this idiot is going to have us living in the 1950s. Watch out women, your voting rights may soon be on the chopping block. Hope this shit show ends before he can fuck anymore shit up.
7435 2018-08-19 22:01:30 最後の力振り絞ってるから
7436 2018-08-19 22:01:29 Crude oil, I hope. Keep the paymasters happy.
7437 2018-08-19 22:01:24 Just watched @LovingVincent -robbed of an Oscar. Truly mesmerising (an entire film painted in oil paints by hand). Straw hats off and paint brushes in the air to the incredible team who produced this masterpiece.
7438 2018-08-19 22:01:22 Enggak lah :(

Aku aja udah pake mc, baby oil, fw masih ngescrub kalo sampe pake primer. Gatel gitu. Apa aku alergi kali ya?
7439 2018-08-19 22:01:06 おはごです

7440 2018-08-19 22:00:57 IV vitamins are not snake oil...vitamins are not snake oil..many chronically sick people including #pwme gain great benefit from them.Which is more than can be said for the NHS which offers no treatment at all.Shame on you @mgtmccartney
7441 2018-08-19 22:00:55 Hemp oil mate
7442 2018-08-19 22:00:40 This is so true. Why do they knowingly ordain homosexuals and not e.g., eunuchs or hemaphrodites? Why do they use wine instead of grape juice or not baptize with oil?

7445 2018-08-19 22:00:23 the snake oil salesman will make everything better!
7446 2018-08-19 22:00:12 Ugh i need to change my oil
7447 2018-08-19 21:59:57 Well City owners are practically a state using oil revenue, a far cry from the Glazers who are also looking to survive on leaching the club.
7448 2018-08-19 21:59:43 It’s DELISH! It was chicken meatballs with fresh parsley, spinach, and spices gently fried in some olive oil and then served with a marinara sauce and cauliflower rice. EVERYTHING ORGANIC AND CLEAN. Was so good
7449 2018-08-19 21:59:33 I would say me but I recently took my voice into the shop and don’t have any info yet on when it’ll be fixed, I think it just needs an oil change tho
7450 2018-08-19 21:59:09 Someone change my oil
7451 2018-08-19 21:59:06 The issue here is that -I think- they are fine tuned to work with Venezuelan crude oil...
7452 2018-08-19 21:59:00 The world HAS to get off #Oil. It is the currency of war, #MassMurder & #WarCrimes
7453 2018-08-19 21:58:45 Has no one told Trump of the billions in subsidies the government gives to the dirty carbon-based oil companies?
7454 2018-08-19 21:58:38 It is all part of a longer story, about how the West put Saddam there, to ensure access to oil, while western companies supplied his materiel, for profit. re the Kurds, google Arthur (later aka bomber) Harris and the MIddle East wars of the 1920s.
7455 2018-08-19 21:58:31 Blend up the shells with vegetable oil and make lobster aeoli! You can make lobster mayo with it.
7456 2018-08-19 21:58:30 If America's oil reserves and alternative fuels don't interest you, then you are likely not a responsible adult.
7457 2018-08-19 21:58:16 When my car is getting close to needing an oil change I start reevaluating everything. Do I really wanna see that friend on the other side of town? Do I really need groceries? Do I really need to go to work everyday this week?
7458 2018-08-19 21:58:16 To all you losers including you Maggster, you’re stuck with Trump or Pence!  If you do try impeachment, you might want to stock up on provisions as 70% of #truckers will give you the biggest strike you’ve ever seen!  Coal Miners, machinists, oil workers will be there to follow.
7459 2018-08-19 21:57:46 moさんのDVD演技だけ見ました。未発表のoil&waterがすごいという噂に聞いていましたがここまでとは… というかoil&waterの数が半端無いです、そしてその全部が面白かった。
作品全体で行くと、リワインド2が1番好きで見ていて鳥肌立ちました。いやーよかった。
7460 2018-08-19 21:57:44 I've got my essential oil diffuser going, with cough drops, the rain, and a terrible cold.

Who wants to go to work for me tomorrow?
7461 2018-08-19 21:57:42 Health care is NOT a right. Bank bailouts, oil subsidies, military contracts and tax cuts ARE rights, let's keep our spending priorities straight!
7462 2018-08-19 21:57:33 The LNP leadership should be determined by Turkish Oil Wrestling.  The vision should be broadcast at the start of each day across all television networks.
7463 2018-08-19 21:57:23 And they’ll return a small, but electorally significant, portion to GOP candidates in return.  Deck is stacked against common people unless they vote in droves and wise up. They’re getting games by snake oil salesmen.
7464 2018-08-19 21:57:23 I must ask you to read the tweet “cannabis packaged as candy can be really dangerous for kids”. No mention of fatality and specifically points to cannabis packaged as candy not medicinal oil for refractory seizures.
7465 2018-08-19 21:57:17 Gavin is a snake oil salesmen 
7466 2018-08-19 21:56:38 Oh I am so excited to see what this dude does in a oil rig, saving the... president... Or.... I kind of lost the plot I was thinking about flat earth theory for half of the cutscenes
7467 2018-08-19 21:56:31 The only thing that pops on my stove is oil tbh 
7468 2018-08-19 21:56:22 がははは…‥…………
　あざーっす(^ー^)
7469 2018-08-19 21:55:46 Palm oil in many COUNTRIES comes from plantations which do NOT contribute to deforestation. Stop the broad smear if you don't know what you are talking about.
7470 2018-08-19 21:55:42 the mouthwatering taste of oil
7471 2018-08-19 21:55:27 Then she needs to oil her engine.
7472 2018-08-19 21:55:23 長期休暇後初日は、魔の月曜。

不安症状と動悸で目がぱっちり。

連休は身体にもメンタルにもよくない気がする。

7474 2018-08-19 21:54:52 There is no need for small population or oil fields. A good governance not entirely dedicated to the interests of the super-rich and corporations would amply suffice.
7475 2018-08-19 21:54:52 TSLA Big Oil Conspiracy for Bulls: Saudis bought 5% BECAUSE it’s in trouble. Their plan all along was to dump at the strategic time and deliver the deathblow. @markbspiegel @TeslaCharts @ContrarianShort
7476 2018-08-19 21:54:23 そうですね〜
良い一年になりますように
おめでとうございます
7477 2018-08-19 21:54:00 Feeling just like that. Waiting for the Collagen & Brian Octane Oil to go on Sale. 
7478 2018-08-19 21:53:52 Yeah, we dump on monday-tuesday and "etf" will put more oil in fire

7484 2018-08-19 21:52:45 Lentils are always a good option. Some chopped carrots, onions, celery, and lentils with a bit of olive oil in a pot. A couple spices (cumin, garam masala, turmeric, cayenne (if you like spicy). Some salt.  Then just add stock and let it simmer till lentils are tender.
7485 2018-08-19 21:52:32 very hip oil
7486 2018-08-19 21:52:31 or oil
7487 2018-08-19 21:52:28 “i’m so glad you only smoke CBD oil now” -my mom completely making shit up because that is just not true.
7488 2018-08-19 21:52:22 The entire income tax is unconstitutional and only came to be in 1913.  There's no such thing as "gov't tax credits" in a CONSTITUTIONAL America, only in a hybrid socialist America.  And who gets TImber/oil/mineral?  Maybe Alaska.  So move there if ya' want.
7489 2018-08-19 21:51:51 im gonna incorporate sesame oil into my pm skin care routine.... hopefully that doesnt backfire
7490 2018-08-19 21:51:51 #CrudeOil could be looking for a bounce on positive US/China trade talks, but if China continues to slow their purchases of US oil and we see a global economic slowdown, it will be hard to be bullish here, especially if inventories continue to build. #OOTT
7491 2018-08-19 21:51:44 Wow. I told u he's a snake oil salesman..  he needs to be impeached and quickly
7492 2018-08-19 21:51:29 IPAS taste like motor oil
7493 2018-08-19 21:51:23 Pls u ever seen a guy using palm oil to masturbate be 4

7495 2018-08-19 21:51:12 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
7496 2018-08-19 21:51:11 I just found out my aunt gets 50 gallons of olive oil shipped here from her family in Greece every year, that is #GOALS
7497 2018-08-19 21:50:53 Lavander oil is what I smell like these days  absolutely love it
7498 2018-08-19 21:50:52 Then dressing: lime juice, honey, olive oil, some chili powder, a little water, salt and pepper! Make it to taste. (2/2)
7499 2018-08-19 21:50:30 Falwell is a charlatan snake oil salesman. If there ever was any Christian value in him he long ago abrogated it for the almighty dollar.
7500 2018-08-19 21:50:25 im cooking bacon and the oil popped and burned me and i literally said out loud “fuck off. you can pop all you want sister but ill pop way more”
7501 2018-08-19 21:50:21 And Lesley it may have missed you but burning oil and gas to generate electricity, in the event of independence, does not fit in with SNP policies written by the Greens?
Wind power is heavily subsidized and is already expensive. Guess who pay the subsidies? Not Holyrood.
7502 2018-08-19 21:50:20 I had to use olive oil in these brownies so I hope they still taste okay
7503 2018-08-19 21:50:13 Rudy Guiliani tucking into a plate of his own testicles sauteed in oil and garlic: "I'm not eating my own balls."
7504 2018-08-19 21:50:12 Thanks I'm also doing the Benadryl Pepcid thing. I make him a "witches brew" with ricotta cheese for Lysine, fish oil and golden paste...he gobbles it up.
7505 2018-08-19 21:49:48 お～～～～オイルさん
　ありがとうございますこれからも良い歳の重ね方をしたいっすね(^ー^)
7506 2018-08-19 21:49:37 It tastes lovely but it looked a bit grey. I wonder if it is all the olive oil I had to add because it was a bit dry.  Next time I'll use more egg yolks to give it better colour rather than so much olive oil.  But will definitely do it again,  gluten eater OH also liked it 
7507 2018-08-19 21:49:31 Bullshit. ASSad backs ISIS and he is their biggest customer for their oil. Look it up. 
7508 2018-08-19 21:49:24 if coconut oil does remove it then ummmm pray
7509 2018-08-19 21:49:17 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
7510 2018-08-19 21:49:02 The ONLY time I like the smell of coconut is tanning oil 
7511 2018-08-19 21:49:02 That and coconut oil apparently 
7512 2018-08-19 21:48:44 welcome - used to love working in sanguine myself (have you tried the sanguine oil pencil - it's smoother than the normal one, which tends to be slightly scratchy)
7513 2018-08-19 21:48:38 I would enjoy to drop in remove your boots, the tights and massage you in  lovely scented oil, all the way up your legs.....
7514 2018-08-19 21:48:23 Congrats!!!!

7516 2018-08-19 21:48:20 Why aren’t GOP calling out greedy banks, oil and health insurance companies in the same way they do with social media companies?
7517 2018-08-19 21:48:16 Such a boring salad. Try arugula, دبس رمان, green apples, olive oil, and pomegranate.

7524 2018-08-19 21:46:44 depends on the pizza. If its a white pizza w/ ricotta, olive oil and garlic yeah; if it's a red pizza, there need to be a few more veggie toppings for me but either way they're fine
7525 2018-08-19 21:46:18 There aren't a lot of things more heinous than abundance mindset MFers. Selling snake oil optimism to the despondent and desperate with your one smile and good vibes away from a fortune bullshit, Jesus fuck.

7528 2018-08-19 21:46:09 Opens up a new avenue for revenue. To get anything but, you have to pay extra and they claim the law makes them do it.
7529 2018-08-19 21:46:06 The "conquerers'" victories are always shortsighted. Western nations are wholly dependent upon the oil of those conquered peoples. Who owns whom?
7530 2018-08-19 21:46:01 I suspect the @LincolnMotorCo engineers that designed this car would not approve of the oil reservoir on the roof. Great hobby, have fun with it.
7531 2018-08-19 21:45:56 Thanks.  I was meaning legalised like alcohol (and #Cannabis is in Colorado and California).  You know, when any responsible adult may choose what they ingest.

BTW, if a sick person can't go to a Dr and get a prescription without "approval", that oil ain't really "legal" either.
7532 2018-08-19 21:45:55 You ever just have negative random thoughts?
Like I be at work and my subconscious is like 
“You should stick your hand in that hot oil”

7534 2018-08-19 21:45:48 Those who do not properly temper their garlic miss out so much

Just a little oil, low-medium heat, diced garlic; add to whatever - added some to some chili a few hours ago

The smell is heavenly
7535 2018-08-19 21:45:45 Turkey-Iran aren't in "isolation" (if can use that word for 2 countries), but in context of all Eastern Bloc (China PetroYuan, Russia/India non-$ oil trade etc), all big deal.

Hard to predict exact timing beyond reading tea leaves.

BTW, "no one" has the clout?! Never say never.

7541 2018-08-19 21:44:55 The british state used to give an honest account of Scotland's financial 'contribution' (or forced tribute) until the early 1920s.
What does that tell you? They thought they'd get away with it indefinitely. And that was *before* we struck oil or had a booming whisky industry.
7542 2018-08-19 21:44:52 Cut off export  of water and oil to the USA and see how they responed
7543 2018-08-19 21:44:52 I’ve heard olive oil is good for skin!
7544 2018-08-19 21:44:40 I'm livid but I've heard it numerous times that Scotland is a burden to the English. Think they forget who had all the oil 
7545 2018-08-19 21:44:33 This is how it all begins, you touch this American goat and ten years from now their will be American troops on our soils trying to bring peace amongst us, it happened in Asia,Arabic nations, A people being told on how they'll explore & utilise their oil,
7546 2018-08-19 21:44:28 I can’t find my cbd oil. I’m so sad 
7547 2018-08-19 21:44:23 Ongetwijfeld zal die Senior Snake Oil Salesman van De Morgen een of andere privacyschending zien in het openen van die handtassen om vast te stellen dat ze leeg waren.

I’m getting bored honestly. Yawn.

7552 2018-08-19 21:43:41 Jinnah was a Maahir e Qanoon. He foresaw such matters Pre birth of this nation. He gave minorities full protection just because of these matters. Oil rich Arab nations are way busy with leisure the Malba is dropped down on 3rd world nations like Afghanistan etc.

7557 2018-08-19 21:42:56 He spent 700 billion on our military 
He armed Ukraine
He has issued massive sanctions against Russia
We killed 200 Russian mercenaries in Syria
He told Germany to stop buying Oil from Russia

Which one do you think Putin likes most?
7558 2018-08-19 21:42:53 Just infuse olive oil?
7559 2018-08-19 21:42:52 Venezuela has many problems. I'm afraid you will believe what you want. Washington's ban on Americans buying Venezuelan bonds & it's threat for an oil embargo created a catastrophic scenario given that Washington buys a third of local production & provides 75% of liquidity.
7560 2018-08-19 21:42:52 I would LOVE if we could get off oil. In the meantime I'm thrilled the impact is being diminished. 40% reductions are from a production standpoint to be sure. Remember: we don't have to burn what we pull out. Keep pushing for infrastructure innovation too! @PassiveBldgsCan
7561 2018-08-19 21:42:49 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
7562 2018-08-19 21:42:25 Lol haan wat I do naaa
7563 2018-08-19 21:42:24 Free Your Oil And The Rest Shall Follow
7564 2018-08-19 21:42:16 It's so surprising they are considered our allies in the ME.  I researched this, after 911 hijackers were identified.  What I learned was the Nixon worked out a deal with SA with the petro dollar, and all oil would be converted to the dollar in trade; USA could offshore our debt
7565 2018-08-19 21:42:06 Norway has extracted less oil from it's waters than the UK has extracted from Scottish waters. Norway has a oil generated wealth fund of $1,000,000,000,000 USD. So yes Hardeep is right.
7566 2018-08-19 21:41:59 dropped it again.. well not really just didn’t put the kick stand down on all the way.  now all of my gas and oil leaked out

7568 2018-08-19 21:41:40 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

7570 2018-08-19 21:41:26 Oil for Subarus is called subricant
7571 2018-08-19 21:41:25 I make those. My favorite is sausage with potatoes, onions, cauliflower, fresh tomatoes, garlic, salt and pepper, fresh basil, and olive oil. But I’ll try it with anything.
7572 2018-08-19 21:41:05 Food oil is like lip gloss it wipes away quickly but we love
7573 2018-08-19 21:41:05 What kind of moron thinks that these regs were designed to *conserve oil*? They were intended to lower emissions and save money.
7574 2018-08-19 21:41:05 Perhaps he'd like to lick road dirt, oil & other toxins off his fur? How is he at paying the vet's bills when that poor animal is made sick? The psychological harm! Nasty man
7575 2018-08-19 21:41:03 I'm afraid that money has already been earmarked for a variety of things several times over. Basic maths tells me you can only spend it once. And it sure as hell won't be spent on the NHS.

Oh, and it wasn't £350m, but never let facts get in the way of a good dose of snake oil.
7576 2018-08-19 21:41:00 Eat the cartel avacodos(organic only please) and focus on Monsanto   and Big Pharma and Oil cos. Bc they're way worse. Kill a lot more peeps

Talk about cartels and murderous people? How many people have died over oil?
Stop driving and then we'll talk about avocados.
7577 2018-08-19 21:40:58 I used coconut oil for the first time and omg I'm so soft and my hair is so smooth and shiny and I smell delicious
7578 2018-08-19 21:40:47 have just saged my room to clear all negativity , lit a candle , put some lavender oil on my pillow , playing some meditation music and have an incense stick burning just to calm the sheer ANXIETY I have surrounding tomorrow morning

7592 2018-08-19 21:37:55 Real wages hv fallen almost 10% since 2006.

They are lemmings who are buying the snake oil.
7593 2018-08-19 21:37:51 @Dinahberry_ all hail big oil.

7596 2018-08-19 21:37:09 Don't forget that it's also not helped by international sanctions see 2018 election issues, corruption and the fact that a decade ago oil production was 3.2 million barrels a day compared to 1.4 million today.
7597 2018-08-19 21:36:56 @aphriainc  Just wonder why the syringe and the plastic spout coming with Rideau cbd oil are now loose in the box and no longer in a protective plastic...Do i have to sterilize them now before using?
7598 2018-08-19 21:36:44 I'd rather have Obama letting the banks choose his cabinet rather than Trump, or expanding the drone program, or stopping single payer, or making tax cuts for the rich permanent, or prosecuting whistleblowers, or lifting the ban on oil exports, or expanding surveillance, or...

7608 2018-08-19 21:35:39 Did oil companies promise @realDonaldTrump a percentage of their increased profits??
7609 2018-08-19 21:35:27 If you are so concerned about Venezuela ask your government and bosses to stop the illegal sanctions. Let Venezuelan people use their oil how they want. You already had plenty of blood and oil from all the countries you invaded.
7610 2018-08-19 21:35:10 He's only a "tyrant" to the criminals & their beneficiaries. A tyrant who has no single oil block. But took oil blocks from them & they were running helter skelter, regrouping seeking his downfall...they are going down!

7613 2018-08-19 21:34:27 Thanks so much for your extensive reply. Very glad to hear this about your palm oil 
7614 2018-08-19 21:34:20 Looks like nonsense to me. Current oil production is 30% lower and without tax changes would've been lower still. Jobs saved by sustaining production, Exchequer benefits by deferring abandonment costs much of which is borne by the tax payer. Indeed #Toryeconomics thank goodness
7615 2018-08-19 21:34:10 This country has been in an “infinite loop” since I was kid and sadly it may remain so till after my time. 

Every time I stumble on the news they’re arguing about politics, rice/tomatoes production, NNPC oil 

10 years later, nothing has changed. Same thing on TV tho. 
7616 2018-08-19 21:34:05 I'm reminded of a Canadian oil sands player circa 2011 who opined they were part of the sol'n by placing bets on fusion. I said it's not helpful as it can't scale fast enough to avoid catastrophic warming. She asserted boldly in 10 years it'd be ready for primetime! Amateur hour.

7619 2018-08-19 21:33:48 Which tax revenues do you think we’re missing out on keeping in mind that you’re presenting RTS export data - not taxation data which doesn’t use RTS to calculate oil taxation figures.
7620 2018-08-19 21:33:48 WHY??
-Historical Tax Cuts!
-Unprecedented Deregulation!
-Record-Low Unemployment!
-Record-Corporate Profits!
-Record-Oil & Gas-Exploration & Exportation!
-Record-Business Optimism!
-Trump-Rebalancing All Trade!

7622 2018-08-19 21:33:33 Hey @S1N1STERBlaze_  can you explain your very controversial “Fish Oil” tweet? 

It has everyone talking.
7623 2018-08-19 21:33:16 Y, esa zona fue entregada a Sierra Oil, y milagrosamente encontraron reservas de petróleo y gas en 90 días, así ó más la corrupción que tenemos en nuestro país, pero no escucho a esos economistas ni columnistas volver a mencionar ese tema.
7624 2018-08-19 21:33:12 I can't say that... Oil or acrylics
7625 2018-08-19 21:32:45 Hmm.. You are very brilliant... I hope you gain employment into an oil company oh... My prayers for you coz you can't go through all that stress and not work in one
7626 2018-08-19 21:32:35 Hit that ultra-instinct with them oil changes
7627 2018-08-19 21:32:29 Should just be the oil mate - pop it in the fridge if you're nervous
7628 2018-08-19 21:32:21 And for info, Ven did stupid things like sell its oil at massive discount to its people... When you give away stuff like this, you debase your currency.

This has nothing to do with money printing that happens EVERY day.

7658 2018-08-19 21:28:37 Today I: 

changed the oil in both cars.
mowed the yard
cooked lunches for the week
changed 2 toilet seats
2 loads of laundry
dishes
fed children 
replaced lighting in walls
cleaned 2 dirty bottoms

And I still don’t do as much as my wife.
7659 2018-08-19 21:28:24 That can squeeze you I can squeeze ooo
7660 2018-08-19 21:28:16 I think mostly they use it to balance out the loss of revenue from the oil and get their construction projects funded again. All I can find is a piece on how they are aiming to exceed $150bn in the next couple of years (from hajj & umrah).

7673 2018-08-19 21:26:29 He wields power thru fear, confusion, division. He’s self-centered. He shady. He’s insecure. He’s a snake oil salesmen that can be seen from a mile away. He behaves like a child. In the 90s & before he was more level headed. “Something” about Obama made him lose all his screws.

all i want is freaking dirt so i can pot my cacti.
7676 2018-08-19 21:26:03 Initial disclaimer: I don’t follow you nor am I interested in your opinions.|| I indirectly came across a quote where you disparaged Conservatives as being anti-free speech. How bizarre. I never figured you for a snake oil salesperson.
7677 2018-08-19 21:25:51 My thought is that the big difference between then and now is the 73 oil crisis. If we had an economic shock like that, his congressional support would be shaky.
7678 2018-08-19 21:25:42 You completed me like water complete oil :)
7679 2018-08-19 21:25:18 
7680 2018-08-19 21:24:44 BTW, your general statement that it would "never" have been developed is inaccurate. It may not have been economically viable in 1961 when the price of oil was $1.57 BBL. But it would have been in 1974 when the price jumped from $2.70 to $11. Oddly, even then it was subsidized.
7681 2018-08-19 21:24:30 Health- In the works. SocSec- It will never run out. they say that to scare you. Infrastruc- in the works. Renew En- We are energy independent & rely on oil- it's what makes almost evthing in your house/car/etc. Puerto Rico- The local gov was/is corrupt and use $ 4 themselves
7682 2018-08-19 21:24:15 If you don’t do anything else get an oil change
7683 2018-08-19 21:23:54 I was rejected when I sent my first talk proposal to @starsconf, a talk about building GIS systems.

7686 2018-08-19 21:23:09 BUT OIL TASTES SO YUMMEH!!!
7687 2018-08-19 21:22:31 It wasn't about WMD's that was just an excuse to go to war, It was of course about oil.
7688 2018-08-19 21:22:18 ummm.... oil of every pearl's un-insides exists
7689 2018-08-19 21:22:06 taurus girl: recovering from mercury rx with comfort food & oil diffusers, never makes mistakes she doesn’t learn from, holds herself to a higher standard, despite her trademark toughness- she’s a fragile being. definitely has bandaids in her purse.

7691 2018-08-19 21:22:00 Unless we come up with hydrogen or NG or electric jumbo aircraft in 50 years we will no longer have this problem as oil reserves will be depleted and fuel to expensive... Just give it a little time....lol
7692 2018-08-19 21:21:52 Mmm haven’t seen that but Science is hard to understand when it says maybe and don’t know a lot.  

The success of the snake oil medico is to provide certainty of outcome.  It’s irresistible.   A pinch of conspiracy about what Drs don’t know and 

Voila !! Income stream. 
7693 2018-08-19 21:21:48 U will know the reason why oil money is free
7694 2018-08-19 21:21:35 What a nitwit. Canada is cheap for the relatively high quality of life we have.  Even our biggest cities are more affordable than most European cities. Your stats are primarily based on price of oil going back up. Which spins off & increases inflationary pressure.
7695 2018-08-19 21:21:16 Hey #FakeNewsDrews, seeing how you and your cohorts are still obsessing over the same person 2 years after she left the board maybe you could be more truthful and explain that the OIL INDUSTRY requested that she be appointed?

7705 2018-08-19 21:19:53 It’s genuinely very good. Used sesame oil this time for a extra twang.
7706 2018-08-19 21:19:46 Sabías que desde el accidente de la plataforma Usumacinta ya estaba localizado el petróleo y gas de esa zona y fue entregado a Sierra Oil. Deberías documentarte un poco sobre la industria del petróleo

7718 2018-08-19 21:17:53 Mr. Farage may turn out to have been selling snake oil or he may turn out to have been selling shares in a goldmine. We won’t really know for maybe years. But he is, overlooking questions of his morality, one hell of a salesman
7719 2018-08-19 21:17:51 Respectfully, these airstrikes ARE war crimes!  For far too long, we have justified close relations with Saudi Arabia in the name of oil.  It's time to break our dependence.  #YemenGenocide #SaudiWarOnYemen

7723 2018-08-19 21:17:43 There is quite often an excuse for violence . We have dog thieves around here . If I catch one I will kick him into a bloody mess and then peel all his skin off with a blunt penknife . Then I will boil his carcass in oil and feed it to the pigs . That`s just me.......
7724 2018-08-19 21:17:25 Oh, but the oil $$$$$
7725 2018-08-19 21:17:23 Where are the peacekeeping soldiers of Africa ? Every member of the AU, is silent on Africa. Should AU sit down for America to send in Marines to Cameroun? Where are the NATO soldiers that eliminated Gadaffi, wasn't the same human right in Lybia, or Cameron does have oil?
7726 2018-08-19 21:17:16 This statement is consistent with the status of our oil reserves and the alternative sources that are available.
7727 2018-08-19 21:17:10 Their plan is capitalist expansionism into their neighbouring regions. Their track record was always abysmal. There's even lots of anecdotal evidence they fund ISIL even supporting the rise of AQ in Yemen. They get a pass because of oil.
7728 2018-08-19 21:17:09 mmm. A nice dal (ish, probably). Nice level of heat (ie, just enough to feel it at the back  of my throat),  the comforting notes of both cardamom and cinnamon.

7730 2018-08-19 21:16:44 I don’t think it’s surprising - a key thing to remember when dealing with oil & gas, in my humble opinion, is knowing where to look...

...and, from what I’ve seen, those in capital markets often have a strong propensity for looking where no one else looks or in the right places.

7733 2018-08-19 21:15:31 He has taken so many different approaches to get rid of them that he must truly fear their effect, which is curious. Is it because the low price of oil has jacked up their economy, so they’re feeling them extra bad?
7734 2018-08-19 21:15:22 Well i am not trying to make any point here, my purpose was to clear a very common misconception in the minds of common people that the oil prices are governed by the international market and local govt has a lesser control over it, local govt can just adjust the taxes.
7735 2018-08-19 21:15:15 I need to get my oil changed

7744 2018-08-19 21:13:53 oil gonna run out soon dw
7745 2018-08-19 21:13:43 This is a rather simplistic article. Do we “subsidize” the oil industry by waging war to ensure access to friendlier regimes?  How about sales tax to fund subways and buses. I can go on.
7746 2018-08-19 21:13:43 Would that be more or less accurate than the preachers who say Jesus is just going to put more oil in the earth whenever we run out?

7759 2018-08-19 21:12:00 Personal gain. Almost all of our politicians are own by people why make fortunes from war - arms contractors, private military contractors - not to mention the theft of oil & gaddafi & SH’s personal fortunes. Have you heard of PNAC? The planned invasion of 7 countries in the ME.
7760 2018-08-19 21:11:47 Ifthe crude oil prices are low then Not just fuel prices in india but even the imports should be less because majority of Indian import value is of oil. Ans look at the balance of trade. This guy thinks runnng a economy is joke

7770 2018-08-19 21:10:34 I think is the same as buying 5% of Tesla. Just as a hedge against their

7778 2018-08-19 21:09:13 The cars aren’t that great. My X6 has the notorious N63 engine that gulps a liter of oil every 800 miles & eats $600 AGM batteries yearly. I finally got the dealer to fix the oil problem with the “customer care package” which is a disguised recall. The battery requires a tender.
7779 2018-08-19 21:08:55 I put wheel covers on my tires, changed the oil, and sorted my car ready to head to uni all by myself. I’m such a proud lesbian rn.
7780 2018-08-19 21:08:50 Know what the best proof is? See the story of that guy who just murdered his entire family, then pleading on the news to find his children he stuffed into oil barrels.

Because he’s a white man, reporters are jizzing themselves to make it a pity story about how he snapped.
7781 2018-08-19 21:08:20 You talk about rights. What about the rights of the aboriginal people. They don’t want the oil sands development or pipelines resulting from them. We cave to big international companies and allow it. Saudi isn’t the only country out there selling oil. Plus we will have no earth

7797 2018-08-19 21:06:05 The coal and oil big $ folks have had their shot at suppressing #climatechange knowledge and action. Enough -we need #greenjobs . We need #democracynotdollarocracy
7798 2018-08-19 21:06:04 Making matters worse, #Trump just announced plans to reduce the restrictions on fuel economy since this administration no longer considers oil conservation as an issue.  This is really BAD news for #climatechange.  We cannot keep going in the wrong direction.
7799 2018-08-19 21:06:02 Palm oil is literally in/cooks everything, (cheaper than butter). I wrote to supermarkets most came back that they buy palm oil that adheres to x,y,z. Sadly that makes no difference due to corruption. We are strangling ourselves and worse of all our peaceful perfect cousins

7816 2018-08-19 21:03:20 Here’s a pro tip that tastes better!
Use coconut oil to make popcorn. Smoking point is high; almost every kernel will pop! Then pour copious amounts of grass fed butter and sea salt on it.

7820 2018-08-19 21:03:02 Been to Indonesia and lived in Philippines Thailand India, they all manage perfectly without producing oil, some wonderful years there, just very sad migrants feel the need to flee homeland for freebies than stay and contribute

7826 2018-08-19 21:02:28 Unless it’s 100% sustainable. But because of the difficulty in ensuring this, I would agree with you. We should boycott Palm Oil until we can be sure it is sourced responsibly.
7827 2018-08-19 21:02:16 Love Love Love this, My fav thing 4 years...Did you ever notice that it was "Alex Jones" doing the "Krill Oil" commercials just B4 Breakfast with the Beatles?
7828 2018-08-19 21:02:08 Hardeep Singh on CBB lying. How are Scotland keeping us afloat? And re their Net tax figures? They are all prior to2010 not since oil slumped.
7829 2018-08-19 21:01:56 Why do some people come to America for their healthcare from Canada?  Long waiting times perhaps?  Finland has a small population and is no comparison to 320 million in America.  In Norway,  prices are very high and once the oil runs out, the population will be heavily taxed.
7830 2018-08-19 21:01:32 If the packaging says “ contains palm oil”  don’t buy it.

7833 2018-08-19 21:01:10 Thank you Deirdre! Iceland (the supermarket) are completely phasing out Palm Oil, a great step forward.

7843 2018-08-19 21:00:18 A quagmire for what ? Blood for oil, rare earth minerals and Poppy fields... horrific what's happening again... #endallwars
7844 2018-08-19 21:00:17 RT @LivingSafely: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this August? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!
7845 2018-08-19 21:00:11 I bought face moitsurizer that's supposed to have a bit of sunscreen in it (35 spf) specifically for when I got to ren fest, but I used it & now it feels like there is a thick film of oil on it -_- "oil-free" my ass
7846 2018-08-19 21:00:11 The staff be like: “Put more lard in the beans, don’t use olive oil!”
7847 2018-08-19 21:00:09 THAT QUOTE FROM the snake oil salesman ABOUT deporting random children IS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT!

7849 2018-08-19 20:59:51 Oil of olbas? Drop or two on the bulb of your bedside lamp. Fills the room and aids coughing.
7850 2018-08-19 20:59:48 The perspective was also neither here nor there. My own take was that the civil war was all about oil.  If there was no oil, there'd have been no War.
7851 2018-08-19 20:59:36 #HealthTip : Use Coconut Oil

Oils high in fatty acids made from #CoconutOil have been shown to burn fat and promote #WeightLoss, according to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. #nutrition

7854 2018-08-19 20:59:16 H*att f**ked up my credit card bill  I think the relationship between me and this hotel is like oil and water

7858 2018-08-19 20:58:55 I could have gotten into a really bad accident today thanks to the store that changed my oil and now I can’t drive my car until they come to my house and fix their screw up. Not how I planned to spend my evening 
7859 2018-08-19 20:58:52 Just checked our hand wash and it contains #palmoil. Checked out @sainsburys website and found they use almost 100% sustainable palm oil so will switch... the more people do this the more companies will pay attention
7860 2018-08-19 20:58:47 He likes kale and coconut oil?
7861 2018-08-19 20:58:44 How many were of the rules were protecting Yellowstone park and others. And hunting regulations. Baiting grizzly bears. Open up.EPA regulation for mining and oil drilling and clear cut national forest. And let the Koch millionaires open grazing on federal lands.
7862 2018-08-19 20:58:40 I hate dumb ass calls like “y’all sell oil?”
7863 2018-08-19 20:58:30 “Oh you got one of those James Bond low key oil pens now?”

7867 2018-08-19 20:57:43 frying in oil is so goddamn dangerous and risky but you gotta do what you gotta do to get empanadillas
7868 2018-08-19 20:57:05 Do you need some oil or your reset button pushed?
7869 2018-08-19 20:56:47 Jam sab border area poor people have only source of earnings by transportation of Iranian oil in small vehicles to other parts of Balochistan. 100s of checkposts getting gunda text on way. Its share starts from MPA till a Sepoy. Will you stop this black market
7870 2018-08-19 20:56:36 Pork, shredded cabbage, carrots and seasoning (soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil). I like the filling by itself too, without the roll. Drizzled with sriracha usually.
7871 2018-08-19 20:56:32 My nephew recently parked his car in our driveway and after he left I noticed quite a bit of oil on the concrete. When I asked him about it, he said, “oh that little light that looks like a teapot? That’s what that is?” #smh
7872 2018-08-19 20:56:24 I'll leave it. Well, first I'm going to wrap it in a salt beef sandwich, then I'm going to grease it with oil of decency, after which I'm going to douse it with Essence of Jew and then I'm going ram it up your fundament. Then I'll leave it. #LabourAntisemitism
7873 2018-08-19 20:56:23 ah yes, because throwing oil into the fire you started sure as hell is gonna help
7874 2018-08-19 20:56:17 When your suegro is bored and wants to work on your car so he changes your oil  #myinlawsloveme
7875 2018-08-19 20:56:14 What Trump does-good point-is it the RECORD Number of employed 63%labor participation,or our hero's returned home from Korean War, first woman for head of CIA, decreases debt to GDP ratio 1st time in over 50 tears,US oil production highest since '70's want more?
7876 2018-08-19 20:56:13 Well I got my oil changed, Tuesday I'm coming home to see the dentist, get my tires changed and then pray to God I can get through inspection without it costing too much.

7878 2018-08-19 20:56:04 @TomPerez please change your bio to “fighting for the little guy for only TWO MONTHS, till the big oil donors tell me to”.
7879 2018-08-19 20:56:00 Breanna has me beat by light years.  I love painting with oils.  The slow, creamy, glide of  oil paint over a canvas is very soothing.
7880 2018-08-19 20:55:34 It would stick with as plain as possible (ie single ingredient/whole) - agree with Olive oil as it is soothing and protecting.  If the dog likes it, they could lick a spoonful.
7881 2018-08-19 20:55:31 I am so glad that coconut oil doesn’t taste like coconuts. 
7882 2018-08-19 20:55:30 WAY TO GO!!!  LOVE MY CAPCO BOYS!!!!  WHOO HOO!!!

7886 2018-08-19 20:54:53 Shuksuka! Sauca for pasta or pasta whatevers (I almost never buy sauce and just sort of cook whatever tomatoes I have around). A good BLT. Tomato salad with thinly sliced tomatoes, sea salt, good olive oil and whatever vinegar of your choice.

7890 2018-08-19 20:54:22 Sweetheart did you bring the oil?
7891 2018-08-19 20:54:16 That's stupid. Sanders's ideas are better framed as generous welfare state, and Venezuela didn't fall into financial catastrophe from healthcare. The privatization of thousands of companies, reliance on oil, and just printing money to respond to damage are the reasons.
7892 2018-08-19 20:54:11 Try the @afriderm eye cream and mix it with almond oil.

7897 2018-08-19 20:52:56 I changed my own oil for the first time ever and I only managed to get hot oil in my eye and all over the floor #mechanicish
7898 2018-08-19 20:52:55 "For the most intense flavor, basil should be added at the end of the cooking process. Prolonged heat will cause basil's volatile oils to dissipate. Ground with garlic and olive oil into a paste, basil is a prime ingredient in pistou, a Mediterranian specialty."
7899 2018-08-19 20:52:54 STOP LYING - you are a snake oil hypeman who's sociopathic ego is screaming for attention of any kind. All the while, those you deem fake news are busy documenting history which will serve as a warning to future generations. You will forever be abhorred.
7900 2018-08-19 20:52:50 Leave it to states: taxes. I’m laughing while I type this as Colorado is a #Gas, Oil and #Marijuana rich state and education is far from funded and our roads are in major need of expansion. Still...states. (shrug) My two cents.

7910 2018-08-19 20:51:24 Where’s a good place to get my oil changed in Kalamazoo? I’m always overdue for one, and I usually go to Uncle Ed’s but their whole “upsell you on everything” sends my social anxiety over the edge and I’m tired of it.

7916 2018-08-19 20:50:33 Well damn. Is it all tied to oil? Wonder what they want out of Turkey for this. It is interesting because I know we have some foreign military sales to Qatar and a bit of a military presence there.

7931 2018-08-19 20:48:50 I think the missing factor in comparing Trump & Nixon is the 73 oil crisis. If we had lines at gas stations like that (or a similar economic crisis) congressional support for Trump might slip.
7932 2018-08-19 20:48:48 ew.
7933 2018-08-19 20:48:47 it's really about US installing a puppet regime; so they could access oil. this is called the American Way.  they did this in Iran by installing the Shah; to further American interests. republicans & democrats are no different. atleast Trump is honest about his views,credit there
7934 2018-08-19 20:48:41 How about inflation under BJP? Wasn’t it circumstances with oil at historic lows and had nothing to do with your govt’s policies? Yet you take credit for it!!!!!

7948 2018-08-19 20:46:18 Soon Trump will be claiming that oil will never run out.
7949 2018-08-19 20:46:11 Trump is too stupid to realize that conserving oil is good, even if only because it gives the world longer to perfect viable alternatives to oil.
7950 2018-08-19 20:46:07 Oil Can Boyd should be front and center. Anyone nicknamed "Oil Can" for how many Fosters he drank is tops in my book.

7968 2018-08-19 20:44:31 Shifting oil to solar needs the money to shift. It's going to take outlawing or heavy restriction of burning fossil fuel because so many people make money on it: oil leases, oil well construction, refineries, transport, stock holders etc. millions of people depend on that income.

7993 2018-08-19 20:39:30 I didn't realise Stockport County were owned by Arabs Oil
7994 2018-08-19 20:39:16 With the diversity in Natural Resources, oil should have been an ancient fuel source at the turn of the Millennium. Technology advancements have allowed us to become a better society   wide. It amazes me we can’t come up with reliable clean fuel or better cars. 
7995 2018-08-19 20:38:52 Whatever became of Dana Loesch? I haven't seen her stoned face for awhile. Did she run out of bullets or gun oil?
7996 2018-08-19 20:38:51 Development of technology like this by oil and gas companies is the carbon tax performing exactly as it should be. Let's allow ourselves a small victory if they get this off the ground. #CarbonTax will need stories like these for #Election2019, guaranteed

7998 2018-08-19 20:38:47 Fluid?  saltwater or oil..
7999 2018-08-19 20:38:44 I’m pretty sure my pedicure guy is trying to kill me by putting oil on my feet when I’m wearing slides. I damn near took myself out walking to the car.
8000 2018-08-19 20:38:40 My cap was loose too, I heard adding some of the cuticle oil helps a little. I really wanted this to work!
8001 2018-08-19 20:38:36 me: h-

my grandpa: you check the oil in that car
8002 2018-08-19 20:38:17 Oil change done now I need a front alignment 
8003 2018-08-19 20:38:17 Can someone tell me what the “Simulated Demonstration” in the Dawn commercial means? Did they cover a duckling in oil so they could record cleaning it?
8004 2018-08-19 20:38:12 Mine just changed my oil so I understand.
8005 2018-08-19 20:37:45 Yeah, use thyme, salt, and pepper. Rub some melted butter or olive oil on em before seasoning if you’re feeling fancy.
8006 2018-08-19 20:37:45 Not everyone needs cars to feel like more than a rodent, many of us would rather be killed off by Mother Earth than disrespecting her surface by defiling it with the unfiltered oil fumes of this slave-infested surface.
8007 2018-08-19 20:37:31 If it isn’t an oil, who REALLY cares
8008 2018-08-19 20:37:14 I need to make more money, I feel an essential oil obsession coming that my bank isn’t ready for
8009 2018-08-19 20:37:14 Perhaps he could be used to check the oil.

8018 2018-08-19 20:35:44 I'm not demonizing anyone. Its a simple observation. Kwankwaso is not cautious in his utterances. Ba za ka hada dattakun shi da na Ganduje ba. Ganduje doesn't have that natural appeal and public speaking swag Kwankwaso has.
8019 2018-08-19 20:35:38 How about the US oil deposits: rights bought up by big oil and oilnsold for private profit, .... or the bank bailout of 2008 where the private bank, the Fed. Reserve, took public mony and gave it to private banks around the world?  The US. only pretends to be capitalistic.

8036 2018-08-19 20:33:13 Sure he does. If you don’t like what he says, you turn it off. You don’t ban people in America. And Facebook, Twitter, and Google/YouTube own 95% of internet traffic. That’s called an monopoly. Standard Oil was busted up for similar reasons.

8045 2018-08-19 20:32:11 Exxon Mobil, remember a guy named Rex Tillerson? He became SOS, the first thing he does is lift the sanctions for oil in Russia, for Exxon
8046 2018-08-19 20:32:01 True picture. After the goats poop out the Argan nuts the nuts are processed and we get Argan oil.
Lovely for the hair and skin. I bet you didn’t know this.

Do natural products like aloe/ coconut oil give you trouble too? I know you've talked about olive oil. If you filter H2O will it help?
8051 2018-08-19 20:31:18 Coconut oil, because it appreciates my skin lol
8052 2018-08-19 20:31:16 Bastards, the lot of ‘em. Destroying rainforests for palm oil plantations.

8055 2018-08-19 20:31:05 You think the human rights and safety standards as well as the potential for oil spills from barges is better? But you must know better. We’re getting oil somewhere. Why not get it from a place we have control in managing it.
8056 2018-08-19 20:31:03 Worth of oil in the Black Sea. After Russia annexed Crimea, the US placed sanctions on their drilling. Do you know who owned that oil

8061 2018-08-19 20:30:20 I’ve noticed Walgreens and CVS in poorer neighborhoods have more tooth repair stuff.  Oil of Clove has been used to cut pain (found to be somewhat carcinogenic, but are you gonna use that much of it?) Also - wax for sealing out infection.  Good luck!

The old snake oil salesman was lying?!?

Who'd of guessed that?

(Everyone. Everyone with open eyes.)
8066 2018-08-19 20:29:33 Every oil field in Arabia is U.S. Technology that was given to them after WW2
8067 2018-08-19 20:29:29 We feed the dog CBD oil. Def not a business district. 
8068 2018-08-19 20:29:22 Yeah hash but oil? Trippin.
8069 2018-08-19 20:29:01 Nonsense. North Sea oil wasn't exclusively Scottish and was exploited by UK firms.
And oil is worth bugger all now
8070 2018-08-19 20:28:56 It would work if you had some jobs to give them.  Where is Energy East and 9billion$ of jobs.  Why do we give 3billion to Saudi Arabia for oil instead of buying Canadian?  Do something!
8071 2018-08-19 20:28:52 They dumb for smoking oil in roll up. I support it though I can serve mids covered in oil and hash for a pretty penny.
8072 2018-08-19 20:28:52 Papers, no papers. Legal presence or not.
Shouldn't take more than 5 min to decide these cases.
8073 2018-08-19 20:28:41 The 40% reduction claim is absolutely preposterous so don't worry about that. They pretend the emissions from the most carbon intensive energy source on earth is from trucking the oil back and forth to the processing facility.
8074 2018-08-19 20:28:38 I wonder @GeorgeMonbiot how all those questions would be answered for the areas where oil drilling takes place to allow for plastics to be made from drilled oil?
8075 2018-08-19 20:28:29 Shouldn't use both what? CBD & THC? What kind of oil are you talking about? We have all sorts for dabbing. I live in CO & and have 9 years exp.
8076 2018-08-19 20:28:20 I only had 1. Someone thought it would be funny to grab him by the scruff, forced him into a barrel of heating oil, up to his chin! He limped home, and we had to stop him from trying to CLEAN himself. Would kill im! Mom got him cleaned up, while my husband beat the guy to a pulp!
8077 2018-08-19 20:28:14 Do you normally have dry nails? I used to get gel manicures all the time and would use nail oil to help them last longer.
8078 2018-08-19 20:28:13 So let’s drill for oil on every coast so we destroy it all for sure ..your GOP
8079 2018-08-19 20:28:06 The last admin, a dem one, secured decades worth of oil & gas pipelines. Clinton’s landmark policy as secy state was the global shale gas initiative. Just bc she bleated “i believe in science” to the hoots & hollers of worthless libs doesn’t mean dems aren’t part of the problem.
8080 2018-08-19 20:28:05 Jan sahib, do u have mastard oil.
8081 2018-08-19 20:27:49 It's interesting to see someone who doesn't need to beg for  in the job. They promised Clinton, Obama they would be Billionaires after they get out...if they play along. Bushes took all the back door oil  too...:-(

8085 2018-08-19 20:27:22 Mix half a teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) with one teaspoon of coconut oil, one teaspoon of honey ( any honey really ) into a glass of warm milk to drink. It works.

Wake me up when the degree is 15c
8087 2018-08-19 20:27:07 The crazy thing is oil is going back up in price and all the big oil producers are talking up shale again...wtf...one step forward, two steps back for humanity
8088 2018-08-19 20:27:05 Pop the weasel? Launch the troops? Rub one out? Just trying to oil the weeks here, of course...
8089 2018-08-19 20:26:55 every place does something different, but traditional white pizza is just olive oil as the sauce.... some of the chain remixes with ranch and alfredo sauce is just the american way lol
8090 2018-08-19 20:26:41 And venality,greed, cynicism, short sightedness, and lack of understanding that there are limits.  Thank God oil is infinite.
8091 2018-08-19 20:26:39 Let’s hope winning in Texas by 5 points stops him from running for national office ever again.  He’s a snake oil salesman.
8092 2018-08-19 20:26:28 Is J&J's Baby Oil still a thing? Would that be an option?
Argan Oil seems good too. I'm told.
8093 2018-08-19 20:26:26 Hahaha. Have you read about using Vitamin E oil? I just recently got some for this same reason.
8094 2018-08-19 20:26:13 It's fair enough. Sketch books are different, you can't display them as you would an oil. Less emotional, more technical 
8095 2018-08-19 20:26:11 Yup, the vast majority of popular protein bar manufacturers use  palm oil/fat  Why? Because it’s a cheap and ‘useful’ ingredient. That’s all that matters to most companies - but in my view it absolutely should not. There are alternatives to palm oil out there, use them.
8096 2018-08-19 20:26:11 There is ngo oka medicine kamwe ko vicks aka nuwa.. Very fast but you can also drink cooking oil
8097 2018-08-19 20:26:04 My observation and resultant opinion is not gospel
Do your own lemme do my own. Either of us can be right or wrong.

They were giving the Saudi kingdom. in the 19th century, they use oil wealth to explore there radical Ideology

8117 2018-08-19 20:22:57 gaaah I don't use recipes usually but I can be more specific if you're interested:

1.Cook rice in chicken broth. Add cumin, cinnamon, salt, pepper, raisins and shredded carrots.

2. Stir fry veggies with soy sauce, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, wine, and a tiny bit of sriracha.

8144 2018-08-19 20:19:15 Seungyoon’s hands are so dry!!!!! Can he soak his hands in moisturizer or oil
8145 2018-08-19 20:19:10 When oil prices drop producers limit production to drive up prices. Imagine UK Agricuture PLC cutting production to drive prices up, there would be a national outcry. Subsidies ensure food supply, not grouse moor income. Shooters provide that income, not taxes.
8146 2018-08-19 20:19:10 A real fried would go down there and help out, help him to get better sleep at night, or prepare healthy food for him to eat, or propose to take some time outside the factory to get some sunlight, or better yet, write about his efforts and help turning this crazy oil fever around

8156 2018-08-19 20:17:36 Murdoch has business interests in Syria's Golan Heights, drilling for oil. I'm sure there's more investment in coal and oil (speculation). The wealth recedes as we divest from fossil fuels. Listen to Abbott on Paris as a hint...

8160 2018-08-19 20:17:14 @itshaileyreese the fact the spirit was telling you to "join us" creeped the hell out of me and has me thinking maybe there's some negative spirits. Especially when the word hell and evil were mentioned. You're so brave I'd literally myself and pour holy oil if I heard that 
8161 2018-08-19 20:17:05 @bluebirdhemp can I fly with your CBD oil?

8170 2018-08-19 20:15:44 They’re owned by Saudi Arabia. They spew state run media, as is the tradition in their country. They’ve made multiple deals with Trump, weapons, real estate, oil, etc. they need him to stay in leadership and are skewing facts as much as possible to his favor. In other words, lie.

8178 2018-08-19 20:14:49 Oh that great asbestos...and coal. Digging coal is so much more fun. Let’s get rid of seatbelts, any gun regs, any emissions standards, any clean water. We can drink leaded water, have whale oil lamps, no sewers, etc. Idiotic!
8179 2018-08-19 20:14:42 I think these guys were probably in the next boat after the Mayflower. They believe they own us. If not as slaves, then as workers with no rights. They are the ones who speak of the Divine Right to Rule, or Corporate Personhood. Snake Oil Salesmen is closer to the truth!

8203 2018-08-19 20:11:52 It need not be like that. Data is different to Oil, in that you can "sell" the same data to multiple people. Someone hanging onto "valuable data" trying to get more for it will probably loose out to those institutions more willing to benefit from working cooperatively.

The inevitable decline in production led to huge tax deficits, which was funded by oil profits. When oil prices declined, the economy imploded.check it out.

8284 2018-08-19 20:00:48 I’ve been home for 24 hours & ive gotten my nails & toes done, went to the bank, canceled my gym membership, went shopping, bought groceries, packed, got an oil change AND got 8 hours of sleep ugh I’m so efficient
8285 2018-08-19 20:00:44 Well don't forget that "what's good for biz is good for America "  thus "what's good for America is good for the world " lol, i just made that up. Mossadegh's crime was that he was going to nationalize Iran oil industry and that's not so kosher in 50s. it's ok now with Aramco lol
8286 2018-08-19 20:00:39 Be there in a minute with some...oil to help free you 
8287 2018-08-19 20:00:31 Yes food does go to waste and much of that has been caused by the greedy. Think of UN food for oil Only a handful of people control the food and the sell it on black markets for their own profit. If socialism is so great then why has it failed in non capitalist societies.

Glorifying criminals is nothing NEW! You are one of the the dumb ones that brags about it!
8290 2018-08-19 20:00:22 I owe nothing to the power industry.  But my feeling is we should not focus on unworkable things like solar panels. That is just what coal, oil, and unclear power companies want us to do. They know they face no threat from solar. The solution is one that has yet to be discovered.
8291 2018-08-19 20:00:15 I believe Trump is in bed with Gov. Justice & Morrisey to rob WV. They are overloading our schools with oil & gas workers& living on food stamps at our expense, tearing up all our roads, just to benefit the coal & gas industry . When will someone do something about it?!!!
8292 2018-08-19 20:00:14 Hot bath, humidifier, sleep (if you can), more fluids than you think will fit in your body, any kind of peppermint and/or eucalyptus essential oil.
8293 2018-08-19 20:00:12 I think the west of Scotland (particularly parts of Glasgow) have a poor diet Sarah, I’m not sure all of Scotland does. Farmed salmon is still an oil rich fish btw
8294 2018-08-19 20:00:11 A staff member told me that they over use the cooking oil & sometimes cook meat that has been in storage for too long,   (some Franchises) , to add on all the scandals that have publicly played out about KFC people still Blatantly eat it!

8296 2018-08-19 20:00:07 He is correct. It is like you go out and find all the Snake Oil salesmen of the world whose infomercials are not getting any traction and you give them an audience thereby helping to increase their sales.  Truly makes little sense if you stand for #TRUTH.
8297 2018-08-19 20:00:00 I know right, it's all expensive and it's nice they often do discounts - we we're swimming in that cultural heritage money, right? There's a brand my local pharmacy has called "procana". It tastes like olive oil. One dropper of their 600mg works for me. Maybe available online?
8298 2018-08-19 19:59:48 is vegetable oil when she bought
8299 2018-08-19 19:59:24 Does not cook kale!

8301 2018-08-19 19:59:13 Pence's bro Ed headed (IN company) Cummins' longtime contracts supplying trucks & engines to Russia.  Pence also had Deripaska biz ties.  So much more, including his bigly ties to Koch & Lucas Oil, all invested in profiteering from Russia's LNG development (stymied by sanctions).
8302 2018-08-19 19:58:55 Just been talking to Real Madrid fan. He states Madrid are in the same position as us. We cannot compete against Arab oil money that City and PSG have and that’s where the robles lies. Agents are getting very rich by inflating prices for mediocre players.

8304 2018-08-19 19:58:34 I was an 88M and never trained a vehicle, let alone 150. Does he train them to change their own oil? If this guy is training vehicles and soldiers, I am impressed beyond the levels of imprestication. I really need to learn more of his technique.

8308 2018-08-19 19:58:27 They put the “burn” in “fatal burns inflicted from scalding oil”
8309 2018-08-19 19:58:25 Lowering oil usage no longer a priority for US and will eliminate CARB standards. Seriously? China #1 EV market. China, India, Slovenia, Ireland, Norway, UK, France eliminating gas cars and have increasing emissions standards. Will US (besides Tesla) compete in a few years?
8310 2018-08-19 19:58:20 Let me ask this question...do you actually believe a word Trump says? He’s a snake oil salesman, has been his entire life...he hasn’t changed, he’s selling you a bill of goods...
8311 2018-08-19 19:58:17 Dragons den "What's your business?"

"Sir please keep your clothes on."

8312 2018-08-19 19:58:12 Went in for an oil change, ended up donating a kidney.
8313 2018-08-19 19:58:12 The cup and lid are made from PLA, which is plastic. A form of plastic made from plants rather than oil but still plastic. Like all the other biodegradable plastics, it also requires very specific conditions to compost which don't occur in nature.

8323 2018-08-19 19:57:08 Government gives billions to oil companies. Oil companies give millions to Republicans. All day long.
8324 2018-08-19 19:57:01 Sorry to disappoint, the ingredients list on the website clearly states inclusion of olive oil infused with black truffle essence. The promo pic looks like Aestivim rather than Melanosporum as well. Real truffle flavour would get swamped by a chilli sauce unfortunately.

8328 2018-08-19 19:56:42 try using a moisturiser with suncscreen or shea butter, bio oil also helps! Aloe evera never worked for me lol
8329 2018-08-19 19:56:42 Actually it's members of our un-elected hierarchy who own/sponsor the media, composed of Military Industrial Complex, Oil Corporations, & BigPharma, along w ALL spy agencies CIA, FBI, NSA, etc. Those Mike, are who own the media, and can be abbreviated  as the #DeepState.
8330 2018-08-19 19:56:26 @compoundchem Have you don't a self/fake tan poster? There's an organic (as in more natural) tanning oil on Dragon's Den right now making me wonder what it's made of.
8331 2018-08-19 19:56:26 Indians put some oil in the engine, because they're operating very well rn.
8332 2018-08-19 19:56:15 Legalize. Yeah I am concerned about abuse of it but feel that it’s medicinal potential needs to be further researched (such as CBD oil) and made available to all who can benefit.
8333 2018-08-19 19:56:15 Y are you so fine

8335 2018-08-19 19:56:10 I find this claim preposterous "Moreover, it reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent because energy wasn't needed to truck or pipe mined oilsands back to a processing facility"

The emission come from the burning of the oil and the energy require to extract it.
8336 2018-08-19 19:56:02 Point Break 2
Utah gets pulled out of retirement when Bhodi appears to resurface leading a group of eco terrorists in bombing oil rigs off the coast of the Pacific Northwest.
8337 2018-08-19 19:55:57 Coincidentally, mineral fuels, including oil, are Ryssia's top exports (48.5%).

8338 2018-08-19 19:55:43 Change it about every 3rd or 4th oil change.

8340 2018-08-19 19:55:37 Exactly. Anyone who thinks the motor & oil industries, who spend billions on advertising, support despots, stoke wars and regime change, don't run interference against rivals like this and run astroturfing and propaganda campaigns is naive. It's basically industrial espionage.
8341 2018-08-19 19:55:34 Big Oil will return to being the villain again, versus the hero.  It is like the WWE, can not keep track of who the good guys are.
8342 2018-08-19 19:55:32 iyi ki varsin coconut oil

8348 2018-08-19 19:55:08 I just ate a tablespoon of medicated olive oil. Fuck it didn’t even bother frying some rice with it just trying to be high 
8349 2018-08-19 19:55:02 That is extremely bullish for bitcoin. Petro will fail, of course, and they might adopt bitcoin as a second national currency. That would open the possibility of an international oil market traded in bitcoins. Venezuela would also become a dominant miner.

8356 2018-08-19 19:54:11 The question surfaces: If this is so goo why don't we already know about it? Simple, follow the money, not the farmer's money, industry money. Just as we don't see the oil industry reporting on tech to replace oil, drug industry not reporting on nutritional tech to replace drugs
8357 2018-08-19 19:54:09 “#Mozambique is home to huge reserves of oil and gas. US company Anadarko alone has signed contracts for the promotion and liquefaction of natural gas worth more $30-billion.”
8358 2018-08-19 19:54:02 @will70204 The true wealthiest clubs in the world are Manchester City & Paris Saint German; without FFP they can sign whoever they want. United and Real as with Chelsea, have wealth, but can’t compete with oil money; hence they are prioritizing cheaper youth; which is very risky

8383 2018-08-19 19:51:18 This also sucks for restaurants. Like 90% of fried food uses soybean oil.

8386 2018-08-19 19:50:49 I use a few drops of Dawn dish detergent & warm water and soak 'em in a cup. If that stuff gets oil off wildlife, I figured it would clean makeup brushes.  But it does take a few rinse cycles before the water runs clear and the paper towel doesn't show streaks of peach and pink!
8387 2018-08-19 19:50:47 Lesbians are so girls pretty
8388 2018-08-19 19:50:39 New studies are showing that oil spills and the cleaning products of these spills can kill the organisms that eat the algae that causes red tide. Another reason we must develop reusable energy.
8389 2018-08-19 19:50:34 Yes. Something to add on this discussion from Ayurveda. An even better alternative is the age-old ghee. Ghee has a smoke point even higher than coconut oil, has more small chain fatty-acids and fat-soluble vitamins, so heart healthy. Again, like all oils/fats, moderation is key!
8390 2018-08-19 19:50:34 Getting an oil change you
8391 2018-08-19 19:50:33 Haha .. senior man . E no b useless like that ooo. Imagine ghana without it , If Ghana with oil sef b useless. 
8392 2018-08-19 19:50:16 that is nature is fighting back to take out all the cancer off its back. earth is also a giant creature that is alive and you are draining the blood out of it which is the oil that you are taken out of it. earth will tolerate anything on top of it except cancer and that is you.
8393 2018-08-19 19:50:10 1)Are you saying scots are traitors for wanting to run thier own country?
2) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil or the 8% we get now?
3) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run thier own country?
I look forward to your replies if you trust your politics enough !
8394 2018-08-19 19:49:56 Murdering your family & putting your kid's corpses in an oil tank is probably reasonable grounds for revocation of "amazing hubby" status.
8395 2018-08-19 19:49:55 Again, as oil industry-derived plastics are phased out (it’s a sunset industry), the problem will be solved at the manufacturing level, not the household level.

I taught my kids (including my son) how to recycle, what goes where. They were competent by the end of primary school.
8396 2018-08-19 19:49:35 I’m sitting in my apartment. Geranium oil and sage is in the air. Watching TV on my couch with aloe straight from my plant on my face... every breathe feels amazing.
8397 2018-08-19 19:49:25 ikr, sushi was created in NY or something :v 
Tacos have a softer, smaller thin tortilla, while quesadillas are thicker and they're often cooked with some oil and have melting cheese inside :3
8398 2018-08-19 19:49:22 They dropped out of college. If what you want to get oil to the principle that you wouldn't learn at lesser places? MA .

8400 2018-08-19 19:49:20 Not exactly how capitalism works. When a company is a monopoly they get regulated. Just like Standard Oil, ATT, Microsoft and others. Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are monopolie and need to regulated to protect people from unfair practices and policies.
8401 2018-08-19 19:49:18 Note that the aerial photograph used in today's Guardian shows oil leaking from the stern and approximately mid-ship the Galleons passage

8407 2018-08-19 19:48:07 Last time my husband tried to do that he drove to like six different gas stations before just going to an oil change place and asking them to do it. They’re always out of order
8408 2018-08-19 19:48:04 I used to sell “no soliciting” signs door to door. Is this thing on? Is this an audience or an oil painting?
8409 2018-08-19 19:47:59 You loved it, I can tell and that makes me very happy.
You see...thinking about it, that is one of the most important things..
that amongst many other things like jobs and national significance...that people are happy and something great happens from their #ukog  shares.

8411 2018-08-19 19:47:42 Even during my childhood, plastic bags were rare.
Shopping was packed into boxes or paper sacks.
There was less polystyrene packing around new appliances.

These things came in during the 80’s, as the oil industry ramped up plastics production to maximise profits.
8412 2018-08-19 19:47:23 Ha wow! I had an egg today and bought some fish oil and vitamin B supplements. Going to start taking my horrible collagen powder again too. Arthritic fingers crossed

8417 2018-08-19 19:46:46 That refers to oil *exploration*, not stopping *use* right now. Scientists tell us that we can't afford to burn all of even the known reserves, so oil & gas exploration has to stop now. Then we can focus on the uptake of clean energy that will replace it.
8418 2018-08-19 19:46:35 i need to go supply and grocery shopping . all i got is cooking oil, forks and seven pens 
8419 2018-08-19 19:46:30 Sige basta mag dala ng oil

8421 2018-08-19 19:46:22 Provincial and federal Liberal parties not related (unlike NDP). Provincial QC and BC Liberals are more centre-right than anything!

Hardly say either Trudeau was not centre-left.

And surely PET was less left in 1980s, giving away oil to provinces, etc. Than 1970s!

8427 2018-08-19 19:45:52 This is good news right? So the next time they ship them out to go and kill in order to safe guard some rich oil company profits they (individual soldiers) will seriously think about their role in perpetuating this capitalistic nightmare. I so wish.

8435 2018-08-19 19:45:21 The main reaction that landed me in emergency is still a mystery but the secondary reaction that caused the skin inflamation was  a citrus oil used to clean adhesive and impression casting residue off my face after a dental surgery  was like having blistery shingles everywhere.
8436 2018-08-19 19:45:21 It's time to dump his security clearance which will keep the press singing Orbison's crying from the MSM over revoked credentials. Not for the media, first, but for the security of our nation.

8463 2018-08-19 19:42:33 Not entirely sure but, I think tea tree oil is making my breakout even worse that actually making it better. I stopped using it for 3 days and it got a bit better and got worse again when I started using it.
8464 2018-08-19 19:42:30 Largest bloc meetings have ended, Largest bloc has formed, and agreed on government programs ............I wonder if one of those programs in launching the private sector and releasing the small notes, and oil revenues for the citizens.

Y'all are selling us partisan snake oil and promising us that it's good medicine, as always.
8478 2018-08-19 19:40:40 Keep eye on Martinez v COGCC at CO Supreme Court. Arguments in October. Youth vs oil & gas establishment forces. Adverse impacts on people, environment and wildlife vs unbridled unconscionable fracking. #FrackNoHomesOrSchools

8486 2018-08-19 19:39:32 Known old airport issues - blame Duterte; annual flooding problems - blame Duterte; fluctuations is oil prices - blame Duterte... for a change, why don't these whining, sorry excuse for politicians help Duterte and make a difference?
8487 2018-08-19 19:39:28 No.  It will end when the organic compost of Mueller’s report hits the oil’ wind turbine.
8488 2018-08-19 19:39:18 We have been hostage to oil.  Price does not fluctuate with supply & demand. Gas is the free byproduct of refining. Great profits.
Plastic is handy, but it & oil in general are harming the planet.  Solar has been obstructed - kept costly. The judges likely owned by big money oil.

8496 2018-08-19 19:37:49 Go back through Kiwiblog and Whale Oil archives. These two, Slater and Farrar - well known National Party henchmen - appear to be the primary dog-whistling duo. Slater is the little pig that encourages, or initiated, the disgusting racist slur 'Golly G' for Golriz Ghahraman.
8497 2018-08-19 19:37:22 Not to worry about beheading a human being as KSA has a lot of oil / money which keeps the West economy going via proxy wars in Syria and Yaman.

8541 2018-08-19 19:28:33 Why you guys didn't all vote for independence, I'll never understand. 

But the failure to get a big majority of voters to support devolution in 1979, or a simple majority of voters to support independence in 2014, sadly for you, means we talk about how the UK spent the oil money

8546 2018-08-19 19:27:52 It was not as wonderful as some may remember it, after 1976 (oil nationalization) it became increasingly corrupt and populistic, by the 80s the systemic crisis revealed itself and in the 90s the attempts to reform the system were sabotaged by rent seekers

8563 2018-08-19 19:25:58 Sauté it in olive oil and garlic...yum!
8564 2018-08-19 19:25:55 The container is full of MOTOR OIL. This does not seem useful to you right now.
8565 2018-08-19 19:25:55 Advice is like castor oil, easy to give, but dreadful to take!!!
8566 2018-08-19 19:25:37 Oil her up bro. 

Thank me just now.
8567 2018-08-19 19:24:58 I don't, except for the dry or smoked  ones, without oil
8568 2018-08-19 19:24:50 Damn, your arms are thicker than your head.  So much for the big head theory.
8569 2018-08-19 19:24:48 where are all the tree huggers protesting this Saudi oil coming to Canada??? Oh right, they are protesting against projects in our country that contribute to our economy, our well being and oil self sufficiency...
8570 2018-08-19 19:24:29 Muchachos,les comunico que fui a cargar gas oil y aumentó otra vez,3 en una semana,pero Dale,seguí haciéndote la paja con fotocopias de un cuaderno.....
8571 2018-08-19 19:24:28 Extra virgin olive oil
8572 2018-08-19 19:24:26 You there to cap the volcano?
8573 2018-08-19 19:24:20 Conserving oil no longer necessary for US, says Trump administration | guardian
8574 2018-08-19 19:24:13 When my hair got really dry I used leave in conditioner like every other day. It helped a lot. Also, putting a little coconut oil from ogx works!
8575 2018-08-19 19:23:53 I once worked in a voter initiative campaign in Alaska that was outspent 600 to 1 (BP oil vs. grassroots coalition) & we won in a landslide, so I get what you are saying, but I’ve seen many initiatives in California that directly harmed a majority of voters, always heavily funded
8576 2018-08-19 19:23:41 He might want to get some nice oil rubbed into his feet and hang out with some ladies of the night if I recall correctly.
8577 2018-08-19 19:23:38 When u have 3 breadfruit and dont want oil down so you make a breadfruit pie and ITS AMAZING......
8578 2018-08-19 19:23:37 Bed rest

+ Silver Solution
+ Vitamin C
+ Oil of Oregano

I WILL NOT BE SICK FOR @JSConfUS
8579 2018-08-19 19:23:34 Thats just OIL
8580 2018-08-19 19:23:29 Feb 2014..As of 2014, U.S. crude oil production and natural gas production were 40 percent higher than those levels.  This was a major cause of the GDP growth of that year... Obama campaigned against big oil but congress allowed drilling. Growth in spite of Obama, not due to him
8581 2018-08-19 19:23:27 gets my massage oil ready.
8582 2018-08-19 19:23:19 But the oil firms would benefit a lot more from inducing a 1990-style collapse in Russia.
8583 2018-08-19 19:23:17 Sorry, being pedantic, what "processing" of oil is carried out aboard an off-shore platform; which are are drilling and delivery systems?
8584 2018-08-19 19:23:16 Made some kale crisps tonight. Nailed it!

so so good. 10 minutes to make:
- Dry shredded Kale
- Veg oil
- salt

in a tray in the oven. Put as much oil and salt as you like (more oil than you think as to avoid burning). done!
8585 2018-08-19 19:23:00 I kinda figured Daryl smelled like sweat and roadkill.. maybe motor oil. No offense  Norman. 
8586 2018-08-19 19:23:00 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "ASMR Binaural Bob (The Builder)  Tingly Tools, Bassy Scratching, Kinetic Sand, Oil Ear Massage MORE" à
8587 2018-08-19 19:22:53 It’s a national security priority to have oil reserves. This is yet another example of Trumps stupidity

8590 2018-08-19 19:22:20 These little sharesys of mine, iam gonna let them shine
8591 2018-08-19 19:22:14 im listening to in rainbows by radiohead and dunking myself in rose water; lavender, eucalyptus, & lemon oil + lavender buds for extra de-stressing. :)
8592 2018-08-19 19:21:43 They’ll get my Blue Plate when they pry it from my cold, dead, oil and vinegar soaked hands.
8593 2018-08-19 19:21:24 I think their concern about oil prices is overblown. 10 years ago when rising oil prices were mostly an additional expense at the pump it was a legit concern, but now E&P is a big part of our economy and oil prices support many good paying jobs.
8594 2018-08-19 19:21:12 About 400 bucks a week out in the oil patch.
8595 2018-08-19 19:21:06 It wouldn't be chocolate if they're using that much oil for it.
8596 2018-08-19 19:21:01 Yep.  Yankee game and time with my son. PS If you are a real person, not a troll / Active measures person, stop carrying water for Trump. He does not deserve it. He is a snake oil salesmen loyal to only himself.
8597 2018-08-19 19:20:50 Will you also clarify whether you or @katekelly told anyone outside of @nytimes of your article's content prior to being published? Anyone that might have had a financial interest in $TSLA? Oil companies? ICE car makers?
8598 2018-08-19 19:20:45 How is Trump #MAGA?
1)USA not bowing to world peer pressure. 
2) Oil produced in US 
3) Manufacturing brought back to US
4) US still major food producer
5) US citizens have move opportunities for jobs
The more the US is self sufficient the less the world can hold us to their will
8599 2018-08-19 19:20:40 +1 to the skirt steak, but you have to let it marinate arrachera-style for 2+ hours. don’t have a specific method/link but everyone has their personal “secret recipe”, including some/all of: lime, orange, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, beer, garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper.
8600 2018-08-19 19:20:34 @PaigeChristieUK please do a video on Truthfully Trisha cyber bullying and threatening the physical safety of The Oil Wife life to the point OWL had to delete all her socials and YT channel. This is not right. The only person I’ve seen speak on this is @TheMaskedBabe
8601 2018-08-19 19:20:19 @PurpulHair oil or Jamaican black castor oil will do the trick. Massage on affected area a couple times a week or even hot oil treatment once a while for stronger healthier hair.

You can find it on @BeautyonTApp
8602 2018-08-19 19:20:02 With TARA MERA OIL 
8603 2018-08-19 19:20:02 Ours was solid fuel converted to oil
8604 2018-08-19 19:19:43 Pipelines aren’t factories. Once they’re built, you keep an eye on them & you clean up all the mess after pressurized spills. 
Big difference!
They also lead to the sea, our coast and awaiting oil tankers and towards the decimation of our coast by a spill.
8605 2018-08-19 19:19:40 No matter how much tea tree oil I use it always comes back 
I need to invent something that kills periods in general 
8606 2018-08-19 19:19:32 While this is true for coconut oil, yet Coconut's saturated fat comprises medium-chain fatty acids, which (i) are stored less in fat cells, (ii) are easier on digestion and absorption. Coconut oil is also high on smoke point. So, not ideal, but yes, better than Canola.
8607 2018-08-19 19:19:24 Oil king is my favorite falke player to watch. Now to learn more from this character 
8608 2018-08-19 19:19:21 Water is the next oil. Giving our highly valuable water away for a pittance is one of the dumbest things NZ is doing right now. We could fund a UBI from it. Or something. Or keep it for ourselves.
8609 2018-08-19 19:19:13 The fuel rods themselves, -not- all of the waste. Everything that is used in producing the fuel rods is waste. Like if you had a machine shop and when the lathe wears out it is radioactive and so is the oil in it, and the dirt swept off it, and the acid used in processing, & rags
8610 2018-08-19 19:19:08 i’m an awful car owner ; i’ve had my car since october & have yet to get the oil changed 
8611 2018-08-19 19:19:08 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
8612 2018-08-19 19:19:01 Thank uuu
8613 2018-08-19 19:19:00 @BobAtCraven ask them whot happens to NORTH SEA OIL REVENUE IN THE 1980?
8614 2018-08-19 19:19:00 Brominated vegetable oil, means, by definition, oil treated with flame retardants. I guess so Billy Bob, after a few Oxycontins can’t light themselves on fire nodding out with a cig in one hand & a Mt. Dew in the other. 
8615 2018-08-19 19:18:49 Gotta respond to these would-be seed oil lobbyists.

8617 2018-08-19 19:18:39 Could call it an "Oil famine".  Similar to how Ireland was raped by British imperialism.
8618 2018-08-19 19:18:38 Oil showed the union u for what it really is but scots didn't get to know that for 30 years as they hid the McRone report
8619 2018-08-19 19:18:33 Preach! Or for that matter, Bush’s with Texan & Saudi oil & exec oligarchs that drove the corporate invasion of Iraq and so many of our resulting disasters
8620 2018-08-19 19:18:19 It's owned by the son of Ian wood, the oil guy. Uber yoons
8621 2018-08-19 19:18:16 it was soy broth based ramen with peanut butter & hot pepper paste & green onions / pepper pods & hot sesame oil.  so the tofu fit right in.
8622 2018-08-19 19:18:12 Thank y’all for comin to the oil spill yesterday good ass turnout #Emu19 #emu20 #emu21 #emu22
8623 2018-08-19 19:18:09 why hasn't Venezuela actually blown up yet? Cuba must be buying all their oil & didn't the Feds in America try & control the potential sale of a state-owned oil company? lmaooooooo
8624 2018-08-19 19:18:05 was hitting my oil pen before i even left work and now i’m just@high and angry
8625 2018-08-19 19:18:04 The only oil I consider essential is the oil used to deep fry my chicken and fries.
8626 2018-08-19 19:17:40 omg Im not talking about billionaires and oil guys, for the last time oh my gosh
8627 2018-08-19 19:17:36 He was an African  who was everywhere just not in Africa, he got Nobel Prize but what about Srebrenica and the role of his UN peacekeepers of whom he was Commander in Chief and what about his son and program fiood for oil of course he dd not know about his son doing that job
8628 2018-08-19 19:17:18 Hmmm......I would love to oil those sexy legs 
8629 2018-08-19 19:17:12 @Yoga_Journal Great issue (September), thank you! Just one thing: please don't feature recipes with canola oil ... It's GMO, refined, and can cause kidney, liver & neurological issues. Thank you.

8631 2018-08-19 19:16:53 You did a lousy job in your last post. Now you’re demoted. You had no idea of natural resources and the importance of oil sales from Canada to the world
8632 2018-08-19 19:16:41 20180817 Brent oil
Short Term: Range $70 / $72. High pressure on these ranges! Break down is short term bearish. Break up is short term bullish.
Medium Term: Range $70 / $74.
Long Term: Range $70 / $80.
Support $70 has to hold the line!
8633 2018-08-19 19:16:34 Like, through a series of convenient accidents this Stone Age tribe figures out fire and the steam engine? Or they're right near a natural oil spring? Or do they Flintstone all their vehicles? crap now I'm thinking about it too
8634 2018-08-19 19:16:09 Only nerds eat salad.
You need a good old fashioned Italian sub with salt, pepper, vinegar (no oil) and you need it from an authentic NJ sub shop.
None of this Subway BS.
8635 2018-08-19 19:16:08 Haha yesss, I've heard so many good things about the oil primer too :))
8636 2018-08-19 19:16:03 Check your Transmission oil this morning.

8639 2018-08-19 19:15:44 US says conserving oil is no longer an economic imperative - Fox Business: THEN WHY ARE THESE REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & OIL MOTHA-PHUKKAS "STEAL" RAPIN' THE "REAL" AMERICAN PEOPLE AT THEIR GASOLINE PUMPS ?? WHO IN THE PHUK ARE THEY TRYIN' TO BULLSHIT !!!!!
8640 2018-08-19 19:15:43 Oil Rich country with accessible Mediterranean coast with spoils going to the victor, thus we have ISIS, Iran, Russia, Turkey, US, et al.. Why do we have to rebuild Syria? Why do Americans have to foot this bill? Q: Cui Bono? A: The clique that owns the war industry and media.
8641 2018-08-19 19:15:42 Im not talking about big oil guys and billionaires! People want to put a higher tax on people who make 2 million annually, 2 million is nothing compared to the billionaires and oil guys.
8642 2018-08-19 19:15:18 yes dude I wake up and there be maaaad oil there 
8643 2018-08-19 19:15:13 โกหก ไม่เชื่อ
8644 2018-08-19 19:15:06 Nothing beats home made.  Only takes an egg, light olive oil, dry mustard and a lemon.  

Hard to buy mayo at the store when you read the ingredients on the jar....

....but Hellmann's tastes so damn good.
8645 2018-08-19 19:15:00 Bet, wat kind of oil
8646 2018-08-19 19:14:48 It's surprising what products have palm oil in. I made the change many years ago. Well done to your boy it's great x

8650 2018-08-19 19:13:59 Back to that bandwidth... a war in Yemen where children were killed on a bus by arms we likely supplied to the Saudis, national lands and waters being sold for mining and oil prospecting, and the aftermath of the terrible PA Catholic Church abuse cover up. The slap is bad but
8651 2018-08-19 19:13:46 but i gotta get up and get an oil change 
8652 2018-08-19 19:13:46 Men will call u a slut even if u post the fatwas, men give out. 
Like what makes me a slut?
Posting a fawta about breast feeding ur male co-workers& putting olive oil in ur hoo haa&  tampons being haram, like it's all been given out by molvies (men) 
I didn't make this shit up.
8653 2018-08-19 19:13:34 Very ideal, but the reality shows you can't do that in the short run. The diversification is still work in progress, where do u get the resources from the same volatile commodity, oil? Very unreliable
8654 2018-08-19 19:13:29 cooking food on the hob is so scary , the oil always spits at you cba
8655 2018-08-19 19:13:26 Iss ki rok thaam tere jesun ko jail bhej k ho gi. Kasam se tum jitna baqwas kro ge itna bharo ge. Iss waqt tere liye  sab se behtr amal he. Tumhari 2E ki suraakh k bahir oil se bhari daang rakhi hui he, ab tau baaz aa ja. Kisi b time enter ho sakti he.
8656 2018-08-19 19:13:25 Omg I tried their oil primer and it's AMAZING. I'm waiting for a coupon at ulta tho bc I can't justify 42 dollars for a bottle of oil

8660 2018-08-19 19:13:22 There is no oil in #PuertoRico. #Venezuela is another matter altogether.

8671 2018-08-19 19:12:23 @dbrownAnalyst my hubby has been a consultant for the world bank on oil revenue modelling for past 4 yrs. Royalties/taxes which form the government's share  are different from total revenue.

8673 2018-08-19 19:12:16 Is that another of the SNP's propaganda documents?
How about all that secret oil eh?

8675 2018-08-19 19:12:05 Judging by hotel prices - oil wealth..
8676 2018-08-19 19:12:04 Yes perhaps...they opted for thermal knowing we had to import oil and had diminishing gas reserves. Plus ignoring to do anything with vast water resources naturally available to this precious gift of God, Pakistan.
8677 2018-08-19 19:12:04 also you have Maliki refusing to even meet sadr and others not even turning up. Most of them are worse than oil and water, hows the next gov gonna form is beyond me tbh.
8678 2018-08-19 19:11:54 As early as the publication of Gargantua and Pantagruel in 1534, lettuce dressed with oil and vinegar was described as "salad". It was all giant, and Gargantua accidentally ate some pilgrims with it, but more a salad than some of this other nonsense.

8682 2018-08-19 19:11:24 For all that can't afford expensive body scrubs --- if you don't mind the smell of vinegar use this: 

2 cups of fine ground salt (can be regular or sea ) and 3/4 cups of vinegar 

Will exfoliate and help with oil build up in your skin. 
8683 2018-08-19 19:11:19 Apply almond oil around the mouth to keep your lips supple and soften the lines.

8685 2018-08-19 19:11:17 I recently travelled in SE Asia and it’s heartbreaking to see how much forest has been removed for palm oil plantations -especially in Indonesia.. this needs to be given a higher profile
8686 2018-08-19 19:11:13 I miss being on roaccutane I miss my lips being hacked and chapped I miss every fucking joint and muscle I have getner 24/7 I miss not having to wash my hair every other day I miss OIL NOT OOZING OUT OF EVERY BASTARDING PORE I HAVE, ON MY FACE, AT ALL TIMES. That's all
8687 2018-08-19 19:11:00 CBD oil from the hemp plant contains zero THC and can help with pain and complications from Multiple Sclerosis.
8688 2018-08-19 19:10:51 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
8689 2018-08-19 19:10:45 I can't wait for my nephew to start mining coal and my niece to figure out how to fill lamps with whale oil.
8690 2018-08-19 19:10:35 The dealership we went through this time is awesome. Free oil changes, inspections, and car washes once a week for life. Plus a bunch of other perks. The old Nissan dealership we dealt with before offered none of that.
8691 2018-08-19 19:10:25 Get yourself some lemongrass essential oil. It’s wonderful for the senses. Somehow, that scent rejuvenates.

8695 2018-08-19 19:10:12 this one recipe, spicy moroccan lentils. 1 cup red lentils, 1/2 cup bulgur, 1 chopped onion. Sauteé onion in veggie oil, add lentils and bulgur and 2+cups water. Add 1/2 tsp each cinnamon and salt, 1/3 tsp cayenne. Boil, then simmer 20 min. Top with chopped dried apricots. YUM.
8696 2018-08-19 19:10:12 Who knew car oil was so expensive.
8697 2018-08-19 19:10:06 Yes these figures tell us what Unionists want us to accept however, no one bothers to point out that the source figures are bullshit. 

Let me put this another way, Scotland is the only country in the world with Oil, Gas and Food Banks in abundance
8698 2018-08-19 19:10:06 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
8699 2018-08-19 19:09:56 Same principal - oily is what should break down the adhesive. Try oil first. If it doesn’t work try neat washing up liquid. Again, coat it, work it in, leave it and then try to pick.
8700 2018-08-19 19:09:52 I have never seen anything more useless than Ghana discovering OIL. 
8701 2018-08-19 19:09:44 U.S. still a net importer. @Potus #Trump is in bed with the #Russian's and the #Saudi's, whose big nightmare is that the U.S. and Europe would become independent of the "need" for their oil via renewable energy.  The more we waste, the more we remain a market for them.
8702 2018-08-19 19:09:42 Capitalist america is trying to bring down socialist Venezuela by sanctions and the US then sends in the army and get hold od Venezuelan oil gold and gas fields , we must show solidarity with Venezuela and help them fight the capitalist US
8703 2018-08-19 19:09:19 Mr, @lopp this isn't crypto, and we're learning how to use BTC to survive this hyperinflationary circle. To be clear, PTR isn't a shitcoin, is just a fancy way to name the oil price but there's no public data to talk about it like a crypto project. It's just an empty case.
8704 2018-08-19 19:08:56 I always use coconut oil to cook. I also use it as a moisturizer for the skin AND hair. It's great for eye makeup removal too. I've heard eating a teaspoonful a day does wonders for overall health but I have not tried that yet.
Coconut oil was used by the ancient Egyptians too.
8705 2018-08-19 19:08:51 @_SJPeace_ Trump knows well without Arabs'& Muslims' help in the North African campaign alongside Eisenhower& without Saudi money& oil(USS Quincy-FDR&Churchill to seek Saudis help), we wouldn't have won in the European campaign against the Germans in WWII.

8707 2018-08-19 19:08:43 Discovered my much loved HOUSEHOLD brands are guilty of contributing to deforestation. They claim to use plant based ingredients, yet palm oil which contributes to deforestation is an ingredient, consumers should be given greater transparency so they can make an informed choice

8709 2018-08-19 19:08:35 Boil water. Add oil, add salt, add couscous. Cover and let sit for 3 mins or so. That’s all
8710 2018-08-19 19:08:23 Stop trying to pretend legalizing asbestos and letting oil companies ruin the environment is a good thing! Nobodies buying it.
8711 2018-08-19 19:08:16 That idea of linear versus circular is a good one. The key thing will be making it cheap, because unsustainably cheap oil and fossil fuel over the past 150 years is how we got to this position, and our quality of life is built on it.

8751 2018-08-19 19:03:46 Do it you would look so pretty! Just after you do it deep condition 3 times a week and drench your head in coconut oil lol
8752 2018-08-19 19:03:45 Hi! Our products are non-gmo with no artificial colors, no artificial sweeteners, and we use high quality ingredients like high protein unbleached wheat flour, nonfat milk, potatoes, pure cane sugar, sunflower oil, real butter, etc.
8753 2018-08-19 19:03:07 Oh I see! So that's what the coconut oil is for? To moisturize his hair?
8754 2018-08-19 19:03:03 Having curly hair is the worst, I’m drowning in coconut oil and I still resemble Hagrid
8755 2018-08-19 19:02:56 That was right before the first oil boom in the early 1970s.. during the oil boom, things were all rossy for Naija. And then  there was decline of the boom coupled with misappropriation  of fund. Things got worse  till the new reality we have in NaijaFashion now.
8756 2018-08-19 19:02:54 I’m in a service station in the middle of nowhere sending pictures of my engine to my stepdad because I need to check the oil in my car (the light turned on and then off) and I have no clue how to do that

8764 2018-08-19 19:01:51 My gosh.... we SINCERELY HOPE YOU ARE not PAYING THAT MUCH. You can get 500mg of NANOPARTICLE CBD from us for under $70... much less standard CBD oil!
8765 2018-08-19 19:01:40 It works better than any household product to get the grease and oil off when you are working on your auto as Mikey says tries it you well like it.
8766 2018-08-19 19:01:31 But what about Oil against Food in Iraq by which he and his son made a business, is there some codes of ethics in UN to judge the performance and corruption of UN staff members, or as long as US is ok with you No Problem?!!!

Last Oil game I went to on my own dime I inconveniently had a Stacey sitting in front of me with 2 litres of perfume on, loudly bitched about being cold all game, and just acted over the top dumb. Isolated incident maybe.

8781 2018-08-19 19:00:13 I’ve heard the Putin government described as ruthless and brutal on RT/Sputnik several times. Never heard UK government described as such on BBC! (Despite numerous oil wars that have killed millions).
8782 2018-08-19 19:00:03 turns out there is no good way to epsom soak your neck...
do I heating pad? ice pack? alternate both?

(also taking essential oil suggestions for both bath and diffuser. decisions are hard. it hurts to think.)

That is the goal. Theft and control of the oil, de militarisation, sectarian genocide.
8801 2018-08-19 18:58:26 Consumers need to be more aware of the ingredients that are in the products they are buying so they can make informed choices as non synthetic palm oil is in lots of products and often not always clear it is palm oil or a palm oil derivative

8838 2018-08-19 18:54:44 Nope, not my bank. You don't like our dirty coal and oil money.
8839 2018-08-19 18:54:38 Yea everyone is different. Any all natural oil is good tho. I use tea tree oil after applying an all natural face toner or rose water. That works wonders for me.

8842 2018-08-19 18:54:10 As he is readying himself to do that tell your 'current' messiah tell us what's up with oil subsidy payments and come clean on the 1 billion dollar ECA withdrawal.
8843 2018-08-19 18:54:00 This is why we must ALLgive up junk food - nearly every cookie, chip, biscuit imaginable is made with palm oil - from plantations that destriy and replace their natural habitat. If you love orangutans (I do) swear off anything made with palm oil. It's no good for you anyway!

8849 2018-08-19 18:53:29 The Recipe:
1) squeeze the tuna using your hands to remove the oil. We don’t want it to be soggy.
2) add the chopped onions + chilli, black pepper and salt. Check the taste. And mix it evenly.

8872 2018-08-19 18:51:21 They’re different but somehow related - in the sense that inflows into SWF have come from ECA. Since PMB Admin took off, $1.15bn has flowed into SWF from ECA. Contrast that with the GEJ years, when, after initial (startup) $1bn, not a dime extra went into SWF, despite an oil boom
8873 2018-08-19 18:51:14 I couldn't find the title, but there's a CBC documentary about an African-American sailor shipwrecked off Newfoundland during WW II. The Newfoundlanders who rescued him thought his skin color was the result of the oil spell from the wreck.

With the demise of the Ottoman Empire (1918), control over religious extremism in the ME was lost. By 2018, the ME is a mess: Wahhabi SaudiA was formed (1932), Israel was born (1948), Khomeini won (1979), 9/11/2001, Shi’ite Crescent emerged (2003).

8936 2018-08-19 18:44:32 But could you do that without the OIL ?
8937 2018-08-19 18:44:21 I've not heard that, all articles I've read say rapeseed oil is the best, I won't use coconut oil its too high in saturated fat 
8938 2018-08-19 18:44:20 I'm well aware that marijuana does not equal the oil. But you're still talking about one gram of OIL, not one gram of THC pure. The patient may have eaten 20 grams of CHOCOLATE, but NOT 20 grams of pure THC in one bite. That's 2000x a standard dose. In one bite. BS.

8945 2018-08-19 18:43:28 Yes that was pre the oil billionaires and being taken over by the Yank leeches. Might as well say didn't Britain use to have an Empire.
8946 2018-08-19 18:43:27 But Russia, like Venezuela, has a nationalized oil industry...
8947 2018-08-19 18:43:21 With low oil and commodity prices NDA2 is putting a below par growth. Start addressing that first.

8968 2018-08-19 18:41:03 We were not in the shit until 1973. 1974 to 76 was a world recession caused by the oil industry but it does not explain all the years since.
1987-90 & 97-01 good GDP growth but only matched the position pre 73. What we now class as the boom years used to be the average

8971 2018-08-19 18:40:43 The tipping point for each individual will be different. For me, the continued demand destruction of corn through back door favoring of big oil is what has brought me to this point.

8983 2018-08-19 18:39:48 Thank you!! Stupid question but, since all the recipes I’ve found assume I’m using preserved grape leaves, do I have to do anything to fresh grape leaves before I use them? Soak them in olive oil or water or...? 

I’m going to try these next weekend!!

8992 2018-08-19 18:38:45 But the good thing of the last two years is that it is now completely obvious to anyone who is actually looking that the entire leave movement is led by charlatans, fraudsters, liars and snake oil salesmen. They have been shown up in public. They have no idea. No plan. No vision.
8993 2018-08-19 18:38:44 My dad came to get an oil change with us and he was so excited seeing me work on his truck
8994 2018-08-19 18:38:38 The sanctions make me think Zimbabwe is special country like the ones they invade for oil.
8995 2018-08-19 18:38:27 I believe I read some bio stuff that H has some fam members with MH issues, & is why she chose her major. I think Scottie has some issues too. Notice how he invites himself to things and builds a whole story in his head. Also, he spilled the veg oil which could have hurt people.
8996 2018-08-19 18:37:59 It was actually cheaper for Iran to buy oil from the Soviet Union than from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company which was stealing resources out of Iran with the profits going to Britain.

9018 2018-08-19 18:34:43 1) poverty isn’t a manifestation of irresponsibility. 
2) Venezuela has very low taxes due to its nationalization of oil
3) taxes in places Denmark are quite high and their economy and society is doing wonderfully (better than ours in practically every fashion)
9019 2018-08-19 18:34:35 As use cases go a digital asset that allows parties to avoid space related volatility risks seems pretty valuable. Pretty irresponsible to tout the coins technology as worthless snake oil just because you disagree with initial token distribution / B.G
9020 2018-08-19 18:34:34 You’ve made a moot point. 

Sounds like you’re not clear on the facts or what transpired during the trial.

9034 2018-08-19 18:32:49 Outside this country, it’s not my concern. The fact the take payments to protest oil created in a safer manner from Canada but turn a blind eye to the oil being imported speaks wonders to their hypocrisy
9035 2018-08-19 18:32:40 We will go there this sallah and I'll watch you eat.

9037 2018-08-19 18:32:28 Cause there isn’t any.  I think the guy is crass and rude man, but a traitor to his country?  Nah?  Why did he abandon the TPP?  He is talking about auditing the FeD, and has increased our energy production to the point that we are to be the largest exporter of oil in the !
9038 2018-08-19 18:32:18 probably something like PLA? that would still be called "plastic" even if made without oil. also, it probably won't degrade in your garden compost, only in industrial high-temperature high-pressure composting systems.

You must surely be aware stuff happened in 2008 around the world.

The current govt wasted an opportunity with an ill-timed demo. Wasted sub-40 oil price. Its only been elections and communal stories these 4 years. The entire discourse is Hinduism and Nationalism. Sad.

9121 2018-08-19 18:22:15 Trump lies about lying. What good has he done? He initiated a zero tolerance child abuse policy that separated kids from their parents. He passed deficit funded tax cuts for the rich. Currently trying to force oil rigs on west coast. He’s killed job growth. What’s good?
9122 2018-08-19 18:22:05 Nah, just the CBD Oil for Laney 
9123 2018-08-19 18:22:05 Because we didn't learn anything from the BP mess in the Gulf of Mexico? 
Or the Keystone Pipeline spills? Or pretty much any other mess involving oil collection...
9124 2018-08-19 18:22:00 Bria used to always make me laugh when I was oil pulling. Iono why everything was 10x funnier 
9125 2018-08-19 18:21:59 and ftr   before you think you've lost your mind  the fish oil isn't always in stock  ;)
9126 2018-08-19 18:21:55 How would you use "probably" over an article staring you right on your face? 5 mind of clicking it open and reading would have saved you a whole lot. 

...and Yes, it's "free Oil money". Take it to the bank. 
Only if Nigeria operated like other saner democracies.
9127 2018-08-19 18:21:37 I just put frankincense oil on the roof of my mouth for my hangover headache and it was so fucking disgusting I instantly gagged that’s one way to chase the hangover out of your body
9128 2018-08-19 18:21:36 Because making oil great again is Putin’s imperative.
9129 2018-08-19 18:21:20 The same guy who covered for his son ?; who stole millions in oil for food scandal and walked ?
9130 2018-08-19 18:21:18 We need action, not mere words! Drag M7's ass to the Hague for the dictator he is!

9136 2018-08-19 18:20:28 There was one of they independence marches in dundee like 16k were there and they said anyone that was on the march wasnt allowed into the bar. like r u stupid?? its the city with the biggest % of yes voters?? apparently the guy who owns the chains dad is a big oil tycoon
9137 2018-08-19 18:20:18 They will ban you after the third time or if you smear yourself with olive oil and challenge a checker to a “wrastlin’ match”
9138 2018-08-19 18:20:15  you still dey lagos?
9139 2018-08-19 18:20:02 Love  .@medhemps just published an article on this too but with CBD oil
9140 2018-08-19 18:19:32 Nuts! ... A good thing he says first don't try this!  
It's purpose is not to be a drink
  Nor would I spray weeds with olive oil !
9141 2018-08-19 18:19:30 Just opened a new bottle of olive oil I bought from in Italy in June. Immediately upon tasting it, I started to get that peppery tickle in my throat that's common with good #evoo from Tuscany and then sneezed! 
9142 2018-08-19 18:19:30 Vejamo: "As normas de prospeção petrolífera offshore não são seguras na Europa civilizada? São!"

The Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea, UK, which killed 167 people in July 1988, is the deadliest offshore oil rig accident in history.

9145 2018-08-19 18:19:19 Because If Royce Has To Drill All He Gets Is Oil....
9146 2018-08-19 18:19:18 Thank u! Woke up to no ants in the kitchen this morning! Yay! The tea tree oil really works! Plus, I rewiped down everything before I went to bed last night just to be safe! Not doing a damn thing today! Not feeling good! Have a good day!
9147 2018-08-19 18:19:18 I had cocodamol and clove oil. Clove oil was a god send!
9148 2018-08-19 18:19:09 I would have thought it’s because of the recession in 2014 causing the huge oil price drop and because he’s a wannabe dictator who throws dissidents into prison and has demonstrators killed, but idk

9152 2018-08-19 18:18:52 Like starting illegal wars to help the US secure oil leading to the death of thousands of innocent people, yeah? How very progressive.
9153 2018-08-19 18:18:32 I check every package for palm oil. They need to stop production now
9154 2018-08-19 18:18:25 What is your organisation doing in Sumatra? Palm oil is a great issue there too!

9160 2018-08-19 18:17:41 You are already contributing to the economic growth of Nigeria, as others are empowered to do same, real growth will happen not fake oil growth or the unsustainable corruption fueled growth where a few has access to the till.
9161 2018-08-19 18:17:26 Nunes also visited the PM of Romania? Tied to oil & gas. She is not getting good reviews in her country. Something the two have in common?

9169 2018-08-19 18:16:27 I don't believe the hype. But these packets are great when you need oil for cooking in the back country, particularly in cooler climes.

9171 2018-08-19 18:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but illegal overstays.
9172 2018-08-19 18:16:06 ONLY a deposit will stop the plastics been all over like most European cities and countries, All plastic bottles 0.25p glass bottles 0.50p also for oil or food plastic should be a deposit, that will make people not to throw away but to return them

9174 2018-08-19 18:15:50 The Democrats are fighting for access to healthcare and a living wage.

Translation: they just gave the military an increase of $800b, and agreed to donations from oil companies.

I suggest that the real divide is between people and corporations. The people are losing.

9180 2018-08-19 18:14:49 What I do feel is close to Tory ideology is the echos of vulture capitalism in scamming people to review a portfolio, snake oil scam that it so often is & pricing out the poor from opportunity & education.
9181 2018-08-19 18:14:46 Yes please...adore lavender and would love to have more than one oil burner in our home! Thanks
9182 2018-08-19 18:14:35 Now that's a job well-done. It's made from sustainable palm oil. The spinning action creates centrifugal force.
9183 2018-08-19 18:14:32 Not make up,a 2litre of bottle of cooking oil.thats what she uses.
9184 2018-08-19 18:14:23 Wax is for rigs, oil is for pens 
9185 2018-08-19 18:14:09 After raining, usually oily substances like petrol (on the road)  come in contact with water. and it creates that , the oil rainbow effect .
9186 2018-08-19 18:14:05 I see and it shouldn't keep your hair greasy though eventually the oil had to wash off,so maybe your hair is just naturally greasy?
9187 2018-08-19 18:14:01 Good catch on the oil drips as evidence of actual behavior.
9188 2018-08-19 18:13:58 Omg we just passed a high school in Bakersfield whose mascots are The Drillers.... like, oil drillers what dystopia is this?
9189 2018-08-19 18:13:35 Aye, totally agree- all the big supermarkets should be selling more sustainable products  we'd rather have the animals than unsustainable palm oil

9200 2018-08-19 18:12:21 Then they are going to find out about a mistress.... And that he can't keep a job.... And that she wants to divorce him because he is a DV perpetrator. It's always the same, with some facts that differ in minor ways. To put his little girls in a place that is filled with oil? Ugh
9201 2018-08-19 18:12:19 Yes... can you not imagine how Jimmy could have manipulated things while President to turn his peanut farm into an economic windfall ? He could have initiated an all peanut oil energy policy, or weaponized peanuts for the military... Jimmy could have made bank on peanuts.
9202 2018-08-19 18:12:17 The Chinese have continued to buy oil from Iran despite sanctions, and they are the fastest growing market.

9204 2018-08-19 18:11:56 It's about a country with the Worlds 2nd largest oil reserves having it's economy strangled by the actions of the CIA and it's own crapitalist class
9205 2018-08-19 18:11:46 Totally agree this has to be stopped. When I lived in Singapore the haze from the burning was horrendous, all had to wear face masks. Should be more publicity about the horrific consequences of palm oil
9206 2018-08-19 18:11:37 Why would d retired Generals in Nigeria want to hold on to d Nigerian Oil well again for the next twenty years Mr. President GMB must not allow dis again  Nigerian youth must b carefully f this so call Generals
9207 2018-08-19 18:11:20 He just announced oil is to be used now and not conserved anymore
9208 2018-08-19 18:11:11 If you think about it scotland is a very rich country?

9211 2018-08-19 18:10:42 Good for him. It literally means nothing for the future of XRP and its ability to be utilized. Oil companies drill oil out of ground and sell it for profit, are they bad people? You are presenting Satoshi like he is some kind of saint. Let’s focus on tech and utility.

9225 2018-08-19 18:08:44 and oil pipes which when i ask plumbers etc about their answer is "no pipe is 100% leak proof " and so true beauty.

9227 2018-08-19 18:08:23 I think it is because when I was younger, I had a lice problem. Dad got rid of it with oil? I think? Or was it gas? Either way, he got rid of it in one day.

9242 2018-08-19 18:05:38 I also mentioned the hole in the ozone layer and an oil spill in Alaska. These were defining social and ecological disasters of the 1980s, the foundations of my motivation to study economics.
9243 2018-08-19 18:05:25 The olive oil used to flake too much in my hair...I love the flax seed gel...especially when I tie my hair down for like 5-10 mins, my hair would stay sleek for the whole day. I love Alikay although its more on the expensive side
9244 2018-08-19 18:05:12 We put in more to UK than we get back. England only wants our oil and coastline for defence

9248 2018-08-19 18:04:17 The interests of Putin and Trump with regards to climate and global temperatures are aligned. Both want the ice caps on the North pole gone so they can commence drilling for oil and extracting other resources. The race for the Artic has begun!
9249 2018-08-19 18:04:05 Don’t see the love affair with Davidson.  I would rather enstrom over all 3, only yr older than sekera, Nd has shown some offence in yrs past.  Or use the 1 and add a player for salary and acquire Faulk.  God knows oil could use a pp d man.

1. Today in 2018 Oil is $65

2. Ten Years Ago in 
2008 Oil was $147
9254 2018-08-19 18:03:21 This lavender oil done put my headache to bed.
9255 2018-08-19 18:03:19 #c4news reports on #Venezuela NEVER mention the sanctions imposed by the US when #Chavez nationalised their oil. America determined to bankrupt Venezuela because their oil giants told them to & because the elite in the US didn't want America's masses seeing #socialism work!
9256 2018-08-19 18:02:59 No TF he doesn’t...his ass has been working on that kitchen since yesterday because he’s the dumbass that decided to poor every liquid onto the fcuking floor...milk, vegetable oil...etc! He better be cleaning some shit after that nonsense!

9258 2018-08-19 18:02:51 Obama's stock market was carried by big oil, new drilling techniques and fracking... which caused heavy investments. The top jobs states during his 8 years were states he lost with TX leading the way by far..Obama took way too much credit for things he didn't do.

9268 2018-08-19 18:01:34 1. This suits the Tory low tax/low wage free market.
2. If they allow a 2nd vote then they will have to allow a 2nd Indy vote for us Scots.
3. Oil/Scottish exports too precious to lose. #neverhappen
9269 2018-08-19 18:01:33 I put olive oil in my hair as a conditioner. You could say I have my life in order tbh

There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.

9286 2018-08-19 18:00:17 Lol please do leave, dead weight  happy to be cut. Oh wait, you had your chance and didn’t take it  get back to pumping England’s oil boys, we need it to cook our fish 
9287 2018-08-19 18:00:14 replace ‘sweat’ with ‘oil’ and that’s me. That’s me 25/8.
9288 2018-08-19 18:00:07 The U.S. Energy Department is putting more value on oil then on our number one natural resource, water. How much greedier and more irresponsible can the people making decisions for our country fucking get? Im so tired of this shit.
9289 2018-08-19 18:00:06 Have you ever tried tuna in olive oil?  Don't need mayo.

9291 2018-08-19 17:59:49 This guy said, I’m going to Jane and Finch, if I call back come strapped and bring some olive oil (I thought perhaps so I can oil my scalp) because someone might need anointing 
9292 2018-08-19 17:59:46 that olive oil shampoo by @garnierUSA is the real deal
9293 2018-08-19 17:59:40 i used @KrazyEssentials warm vanilla espresso body polish and cookie dough dry body oil this morning and i smell so delicious. 
9294 2018-08-19 17:59:38 I cooked it on top of the stove in coconut oil, with fresh garlic, pepper, & sea salt stuff.
It was yummy cause I cooked the turkey bacon in the same pan at the same time 
9295 2018-08-19 17:59:35 @lopezlinette 2 things 2 focus upon are liquidity and asset allocation. Resource wise, oil is a stable commodity
9296 2018-08-19 17:59:14 What should I forgive? That more than a half-million Utah acres will be auctioned off by feds for oil & gas development.
9297 2018-08-19 17:59:11 Sinusitis  I just want my bed and peppermint oil
9298 2018-08-19 17:58:58 No they don’t. Peak oil has been pushed off indefinitely.

9301 2018-08-19 17:58:29 I know they do 
Imported oil most of it comes from the Saudis 
9302 2018-08-19 17:58:26 Hope this oil works fast,I miss my ponytails 
9303 2018-08-19 17:58:21 UN was born dead having 5 members of the Security Council each with absolute veto powers. Guaranteed to fail each and every time. It’s a disgrace. The victims of Rwanda, Sudan, Somalia, Timor, etc yell from their graves. Shame on you for selling snake oil made-in-UAE.
9304 2018-08-19 17:57:58 Why isn't #Iran talking openly to #China about selling their oil rather than the #EU.
9305 2018-08-19 17:57:20 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
9306 2018-08-19 17:57:01 McDonald's fried were never the same after they changed the oil in the deep fryers. I'm still not over it.
9307 2018-08-19 17:57:01 Glowing and looking like you swim in oil is TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGSSSSSS!
9308 2018-08-19 17:56:55 I assume only the land owners on top of the oil, not everyone.

So who gets royalties from resources on federal land and off shore rigs?
9309 2018-08-19 17:56:51 I mean, I did avocado with pepper n balsamic, toasted with olive oil? But with Nutella.. mmm.. I’ll try.
9310 2018-08-19 17:56:51 Wait Hooters wings had seasoning? I assumed it was just plain ass not even moist wings in plain ass breading with a lightly spiced oil.

9314 2018-08-19 17:55:37 I think we need 2 pick the right battles. #KinderMorgan is a transition. We cannot turn off the taps immediately & shutting down Alberta to import oil from other places is just insane. #Alberta is stopping coal & building wind. If you kill KM, #Notley loses, #Kenny gets in
#Abpol
9315 2018-08-19 17:55:30 That’s right. We need to increase our oil imports from Saudi Arabia.
9316 2018-08-19 17:55:02 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their Oil Money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling Coconut oil.

9329 2018-08-19 17:52:46 Even by Arabic standards Picasso is a genius, a real inspiration,
Rather anyone who is able to sell oil so expensive is equivalent.
9330 2018-08-19 17:52:44 @yahusefbenyahu bro, how much for some oil for my locks and how do i order some?
9331 2018-08-19 17:52:43 You didn't turn the water into what we call Wine return those water water and those people into oil he healed them he stopped them he killed them when did the book we call the Bible become most popular it was being sold by door-to-door salespeople
9332 2018-08-19 17:52:35 That the copper mining company (in Zambia) underperformed, undervalued and misrepresented its results thus paying the country $50M against copper sales of $5 Bn... I wonder how our titanium, gold, diatomite, flourspar, and now oil is reported.
9333 2018-08-19 17:52:32 The Tycoon Age has started again! They are tycoons from social media to goods distributing to oil. They are the new one percent. #1Percent
9334 2018-08-19 17:52:23 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.
9335 2018-08-19 17:52:17 I just don't see why the "Russia is a petro-state, the GOP is in the pocket of the oil industry" is much of a connection.
9336 2018-08-19 17:51:51 There will be an oil rally when Iran shuts down access to the Gulf in retaliation of US sanctions. Slowing global economy is a non factor.
9337 2018-08-19 17:51:29 Flank or skirt steak. Olive oil, coarse sea salt, fresh ground pepper.

9338 2018-08-19 17:51:28 Sir are you aware of the Crude Oil price during 2013-14 and the first Three years of Modi.
So with such Good condition s and Economy on the recovery path, What does Modi do.
Demonetization
And to change the narrative after demo debacle he implemented a complicated GST
9339 2018-08-19 17:51:25 how can you say that? they now realized that oil is not sustainable and as part of the transition to the future and green energy, they are investing in Tesla. compare that to other oil companies who are rooting to see Tesla goes bankrupt
9340 2018-08-19 17:51:19 if you don’t use oil to cook pancakes i can’t trust you!
9341 2018-08-19 17:51:15 Here's a couple more. Appointed Justice Gorsuch to Supreme Court.Opened ANWR for oil drilling, which many past aadministrations have tried and failed.Eliminated the ACA individual mandate.Practically crushed the ISIS caliphate. I can continue if you would like.
9342 2018-08-19 17:51:14 Global Market crash must will come. Oil I just not sure. Hope we can view it’s peak before down
9343 2018-08-19 17:50:59 A moron is running the Energy department. They work in the interest of the oil companies not to protect Earth. We should be using solar and wind sources.
9344 2018-08-19 17:50:50 I was gonna pay to get an oil change this Friday but since I don’t have to, I’m gonna get my nails done 
9345 2018-08-19 17:50:48 lol the problem is the counter. clearly you need to toss the dough into the air while spraying oil all over it and that is what makes it cook. Only oil can be touching the food item.
9346 2018-08-19 17:50:39 Spray it on your clothes, or spray in the air..use oil based perfumes on your skin they're less harsh
9347 2018-08-19 17:50:07 Fair point Paul. We have 90 days grace for the countries oil reserves. Price could be stable up until the 90 days start, and that is March 2019. If there is no deal/agreement we have 90 days before the petrol stations run dry as of 29 march 2019.

9351 2018-08-19 17:49:37 He’s accused of tampering with evidence, interesting.  Could mean he had their bodies at a different location before taking them to his work. I would think it would be extremely difficult to get into one of those oil tanks, it’s not like they leave them open and exposed.
9352 2018-08-19 17:49:35 Spray zone citronella oil. It really helps, as it irritates the flies
9353 2018-08-19 17:49:22 Is US panicking with this dedollarization going on??  Seems so...

Lastly, US could revalue gold vs dollar?  Does China have a big "gold card" to play or is tied in with market yuan oil futures contract?

Or sending them Uranium???
9359 2018-08-19 17:48:42 I get my oil change for 10 what is you doingggggg?
9360 2018-08-19 17:48:32 "With only a candle, an oil lamp, and a gas stove." Those are the only things you have. The use of the word "only" means that you specifically don't have a match with you.
9361 2018-08-19 17:48:27 Facts and ben shapiro are like water and oil, they dont mix well.
9362 2018-08-19 17:47:38 And I agree with you that trophy hunting is not immune to its own issues. It is a bad sign of the previous management plan if wildlife is increasing during moratoriums rather than during the management plans. But that is what those are for. It's like getting an oil change
9363 2018-08-19 17:47:34 Cauliflower “fried rice” - you can do so much with it depending on oil used/add-ons and you can eat heaps and heaps for minimal calories

9369 2018-08-19 17:46:20 Just spent 100 plus for an oil change and more 
9370 2018-08-19 17:46:16 Very true.
But if they started by looking smaller. Such as old diesel cars or poorly maintained petrol cars. And take the oil burners and non maintained that would go alongway towards clean air.
Most hgv's are maintained to a high standard which means less pollutants

9375 2018-08-19 17:45:42 There is nothing tying the value of the “Petro” to oil except the word of Maduro. It’s fair to say that the value of Maduro’s word is reflected in the value of today’s Bolivar.
9376 2018-08-19 17:45:36 I used to hate coconut but now that I'm eating healthier I eat everything coconut, coconut oil, coconut milk, coconut candy. It's so good, what was I thinking
9377 2018-08-19 17:45:28 Hate to tell you this,
Korean war is NOT officially over
ISIS is STILL running rampant in middle east
US is STILL dependent on foreign oil
Unemployment doesn't count those NOT filing for benefits (millions out of work)
You sound like the MSM full of half truths
9378 2018-08-19 17:45:26 God help us all, tis the month if the budgie smugglers (speedo's) the man bag and more oil in the hair than on the salad. Put it away 
9379 2018-08-19 17:45:15 He also saw the frustration of the white working class. Like any good snake oil salesman he told them exactly what they wanted to hear. He adopted their language i.e. calling people SOBs, yelling get ‘em outta here, etc...to appeal to them. It’s all fake like his presidency.
9380 2018-08-19 17:44:58 Why do you think Burnley flew? They were based on oil rig, can't drive a bus on an oil rig man. Everyone knows that
9381 2018-08-19 17:44:53 One of the things we can do is be more aware of where the things we buy come from. If we boycott palm oil, we collectively reduce demand for it and its production will be reduced.

9385 2018-08-19 17:44:22 Agreed! Overall dietary patterns are key & diet quality needs to be considered. . . 
Simply looking at macros ignores that carbs can be jujubes/oats/legumes;
fats can be transfat junkfood/butter/olive oil/nuts.

9390 2018-08-19 17:43:36 OK. Who the F**K told Tom Arnold about our plan to hang women? That wasn’t supposed to be revealed until we’d electrocuted all the gays and experimented on poor people. Loose lips sink shipments of blood oil, folks. Be careful who you talk to. Hail Satan.
9391 2018-08-19 17:43:26 Got a fair ton of worry going on at the moment so decided to bite the bullet and order the new @NeomOrganics oil pod. Might not solve the problems but will hopefully help me to relax as much as I can!

9399 2018-08-19 17:42:27 Having a really crumby time at the repair shop. 
I dropped off my truck for an oil change at 9 am and they are just now pulling it into the garage. 
Like, why?!
9400 2018-08-19 17:42:26 Although India faced catastrophic events during his tenure, including earthquake (2001), two cyclones (1999 and 2000), a horrible drought (2002-2003), oil crises (2003), the Kargil conflict (1999), & a Parliament attack, yet #AtalJiGreatLeader maintained a stable economy.

9402 2018-08-19 17:42:11 My bedroom smells of oil and lubricant after giving Izzy and good seeing to earlier today
9403 2018-08-19 17:42:08 It's just a excuse to deplete the existing oil reserves and open more exploration to drilling. Pretty much , he wants drilling anywhere and everywhere, regardless of consequences to the environment. Just look at what is happening in Bristol bay Ak. Mofo! Is mining there .
9404 2018-08-19 17:42:01 I want his lamp oil to flow through my bumhole
9405 2018-08-19 17:41:51 I said that garlinghouse should speak with a journalist vs. an in-house spokesperson for an XRP AMA next week; said that he probably wouldn't though because he was selling a $30bn lie / snake oil that is XRP.

Then the XRP community happened, and hilarity ensued.
9406 2018-08-19 17:41:48 Why do these RW frauds always end up hawking snake oil supplements?
9407 2018-08-19 17:41:32 It was  Sesame oil that used a candlestick to break the map
9408 2018-08-19 17:41:29 NB: I said how he could get it done. I'm saying with this bloated civil service and the bogus amounts the people at the top of the pyramid collect, it's not possible, And we even need to make more money not rely on crude oil that can fall anyhow. He didn't tell us how he'll do it
9409 2018-08-19 17:41:17 @BlizzardCS @Warcraft Why can I not find to purchase Aromatic Fish Oil? I’ve tried Henrick Wyther and Sara Bartlett as suggested on the @Wowhead website. I’m trying to level up my cooking.
9410 2018-08-19 17:41:13 Jesus has an oil of gladness above his fellows. If you can't be happy for people, how can you say you are anointed? The Spirit of the Lord operates on a higher level than what man uses as qualifiers...
9411 2018-08-19 17:40:56 3/3 because they can’t control oil (they recently removed tariffs from US oil), they don’t control gold, so they want to control BitCoin. What some think is digital gold and future world . Personally I believe there is a reason for XRP escrow. The US is protecting it perhaps?
9412 2018-08-19 17:40:51 MCT oil has a natural energy boost, from coconuts. It’s just to boost the fat amount of your coffee to hit ketosis quicker. It’s a high fat diet.

9419 2018-08-19 17:40:00 Who sold out the Affordable Care Act out to for-profit insurance companies.  Who protected Health Care profits for Pharama? Who continues to protect Oil interests? Refuses to discuss fracking, yet is hypnotically claiming she protects our environment.

9429 2018-08-19 17:38:23 The article said special advisers and assistants. No where did it mention Commissioners or board members of parastatals.

9433 2018-08-19 17:37:17 My mother has low porosity with a different curl pattern and doesn’t use oil except for once she gets out of the shower because the steam opens her hair shaft and that’s when she gets the most moisture. I don’t use the same products as either of them.

9435 2018-08-19 17:37:10 Oil is amazing. I'm glad you found it 
9436 2018-08-19 17:37:08 What have you to say about the firing of your so-called whistleblower at NetOne? Remember your article in the Herald of 12 February 2016 “Scandals cost NetOne millions”. Truth, like oil, will come to the surface at last. @caesarzvayi
9437 2018-08-19 17:37:04 Whats next? We reinstate whale oil lamps?
9438 2018-08-19 17:36:43 Oregano oil is underrated and has cured so many ailments of mine such as UTIs and right now it’s these fucking cramps
9439 2018-08-19 17:36:37 Yea same over here, diesel and car oil in the middle of each lane. I've liked them so far, alot of grip. Know a few people that use them on the track and unless your 100% on it they last for a bit
9440 2018-08-19 17:36:31 My sister in Christ, u claim 2 be born again but u only talk to men with cars.
Are u baptized with engine oil & petrol?
9441 2018-08-19 17:36:28 Thank you for defending us by declaring war on middle eastern nations, cos you wanted oil, oops, I mean because of the WMDs
9442 2018-08-19 17:36:20 I don’t have a lot of blemishes to start with only when im pmsing! But i clean my face with the boscia purifying cleansing gel and my skin has been good ever since! I use nothing with oil and always wipe my make up off before bed with Marcell’s wipes
9443 2018-08-19 17:36:18 The Oil Crash:
Por qué la concienciación sobre cambio climático no consigue penetrar en la sociedad, cuáles son las barreras que se identifican y cómo tenemos que hacer para superarlas???
9444 2018-08-19 17:36:02 That doesn't sound bad at all. I need to try that. I usually make a less healthy version that includes bacon, bacon fat, chicken stock, reduced balsamic and butter. Another alternative is shredded, crisped in oil then served w/ generous amount of lemon juice and chili flakes.

9446 2018-08-19 17:35:58 You see the Chinese don’t have the world’s reserve currency that’s pegged to the oil. The US has most of the world’s gold from payments in WW1 n WW2. The US left gold standard under Nixon and pegged it to oil. They want to control BitCoin and hope the dollar collapses.
9447 2018-08-19 17:35:53 It's affecting everyone. Not only SA. The worst is still come when China hits back on crude oil. The prices are going to rise. Thanks we aren't heavy consumers of LNG. They've hit on that yesterday. America is about the real impact of this trade war as China looks to Russia
9448 2018-08-19 17:35:53 But every black woman has a preference based on their hair because not all hair is the same. Mine is very fine and dry soft. With mid porosity. My sisters has low porosity. Making her hair shinier. She doesn’t need as much oil as frequently as I do.
9449 2018-08-19 17:35:45 I applied coconut oil after bathing and now my back is itching nonstop 
9450 2018-08-19 17:35:01 Well.   I sort of made mine. Just cotton wool, tin foil, acetone, different types of nail filers, nail clippers and olive oil for the cuticles
9451 2018-08-19 17:34:44 How do we reduce our dependence on oil in JA? One way is an efficient public transportation system. Road and rail. Another is alternate sources of energy: hydro, LNG and wind. The increase in the price of oil is affecting our exchange rate to the USD.
9452 2018-08-19 17:34:38 @BriztolJeff... Don't forget about that "meeting of the minds" at the Mayflower Hotel to strike a deal on oil with the Russians 
9453 2018-08-19 17:34:33 So we went from king David hotel bombing to halting of Israeli cannabis to the us, to Jewish lobby groups to now the oil fields in Israeli territorial waters? You really hate Jews don’t you

9455 2018-08-19 17:34:21 They can do without Scottish electricity, Scottish water, Scottish oil, Scottish gas, Scotch whisky, Scottish gin, Scottish fish, etc, etc, etc, but I don't think they're going to enjoy it.
9456 2018-08-19 17:34:21 Get rid of Nutella. Just straight up ban all products that use palm oil.
9457 2018-08-19 17:34:18 I get drunk off of vegetable oil

9461 2018-08-19 17:33:45 Lets talk to this guy once the oil runs out.
9462 2018-08-19 17:33:30 I use an olive oil from a Korean owned beauty shop for my scalp and an Argan oil from my stylist for my ends. Both are travel sized. The olive oil has a drip nozzle for me to pour directly to my scalp. I just rub it in. And wrap. The oil also helps either the itching.
9463 2018-08-19 17:33:29 Take a ride sometime to Midland, Texas.  Fracking ponds all over the place.  Tanks of both fracking fluid and oil every place you look.  Seriously.  It's overwhelming.  It will open your eyes very quickly, and will likely cause an emotional breakdown for a while, it is so ugly.
9464 2018-08-19 17:33:19 Despite the food for oil fiasco where money was siphoned that was meant for the Iraqi people?
9465 2018-08-19 17:32:43 Vague statement of problem together with hand-wavy description of solution, sprinkled with token pixie dust and FOMO. Having reviewed dozens of "blockchain" projects, these unfortunately follow the same disappointing pattern. Digital snake oil.
9466 2018-08-19 17:32:33 I'd suggest to you to rub medicated oil on your stomach but I don't think you have that on you. Usually to get rid of tummy aches is to do your business in the restroom or to drink lots of water.
9467 2018-08-19 17:32:32 I has made possibly the unhealthiest and scrappiest bruschetta ever o.o
breadcake, split and fried in oil, topped with a can of chopped tomatoes - heated in microwave, and a sprinkling over top of pepper, and garlic granules. 
*happy weasel*
9468 2018-08-19 17:32:20 An actual oil but the one i have doesnt smell whats so ever and its been working, and i also use coconut oil when my hairs wet for my ends super good ill send pics after
9469 2018-08-19 17:32:17 Way over the suggested mileage to get this oil change and me ago make it gwan.
9470 2018-08-19 17:32:04 Do you really think Maduro is actually going to keep his word? Petro will not be backed by oil as they would sell the reserves at a moments notice.

9480 2018-08-19 17:31:05 Is it like a leave in conditioner or the actual oil ‘cause that shit smells so strong lol

9483 2018-08-19 17:30:26 It appears to me the theme for this coming week may be the falling euro and the rise of oil.
9484 2018-08-19 17:30:09 The friendly folks from Dalessio Chevrolet Buick have a table here on Main Street on the 900 block.  Stop by to see them for a chance to win a free oil change and check out the car they brought!!
9485 2018-08-19 17:29:48 In other words we are getting that oil cheap

9489 2018-08-19 17:28:57 Thanks for the update, between 2011 to 2015 unemployment grew by almost 100%, and then the economy was booming in oil sales right?
That is Power. PDP slogan.
9490 2018-08-19 17:28:52 I know this is a completely random question but does anyone happen to know if Taco Burrito King makes their own tortilla chips and if so what kind of oil they use to fry them?
9491 2018-08-19 17:28:38 Nah that blue magic coconut oil is lit
9492 2018-08-19 17:28:35 No! They’re fried in oil! They consist of flour, eggs, sugar and flavors
9493 2018-08-19 17:28:32 Hold on a minute, I said hold on a minute. What exactly are we doing with this baby oil?
9494 2018-08-19 17:28:22 When I go to Italy, this spring for ex., I will have to pack enough hair products to use while there. I will most like get my hair braided so I can just bring oil and a silk scarf. I’d NEVER leave the country natural. I also bring my own satin pillow in case the scarf falls off.
9495 2018-08-19 17:28:17 @elonmusk must succeed if we want to see oil prices go down! More electric car means less demand for oil which will lead to lower prices!
9496 2018-08-19 17:28:14 I cant get over how marie lozano is almost 40 years old. She looks so gooooooood! Akala ko nasa 20s lang. She doesnt look her age at all! Wow im in awe.
9497 2018-08-19 17:27:56 Thought they are 'oil' rich? Getting sick of this spin. Research the reserves of the country.
9498 2018-08-19 17:27:53 Why soldiers fight? They do what they're told. 
Who commanded the armies to fight? Ordered soldiers to fight other Americans for the State right to do what?
What did Lincoln run as a 3rd party to do?
We don't claim soldiers today fight for oil but that's what it's about...
9499 2018-08-19 17:27:42 Any evidence that anyone in AB links this to climate change/oil?
9500 2018-08-19 17:27:32 Israel faces double standard bc all the horrible acts they experienced at the hand of Hitler, they now perpetrate them on others, especially the Palestinians. Time to remove the barriers, but Israel wants those gas oil fields come hell or high waters and will do anything for it.
9501 2018-08-19 17:27:27 Nah mate they’re no for me bits of flavoured cardboard that get oil all over ur fingers dont trust anything that could slash fuck out ur throat if u eat it

9503 2018-08-19 17:27:14 I studied this around 2014 & was deeply troubled by the decline rates. The EUR of Bakken wells is high with most all the Oil coming in the first 36 months. Newer completions with more sand is helpful but the tier 1 wells are probably drilled further diluting a convincing theory.
9504 2018-08-19 17:27:13 So, if Maduro permits or make an agreement with imperialist oil company (BP, Shell, etc) , Venezuela get money. But imperialism is a vampire and it will drink all oil-all treasures during decades. Maybe Venezuela have money but they don’t have freedom.
9505 2018-08-19 17:27:10 I have a strong urge to mess with oil pastels.

9510 2018-08-19 17:26:49 What extra work does a refinery need to do or an oil producer need do if a input cost goes way down and an output price fetches a higher margin for little $ in spending Some Energy companies are going to grow earnings for doing zero more spending others in debt will get clobbered
9511 2018-08-19 17:26:34 We can turn this around - just need "millenial mayo" - artisan mayonaise made with i don't know, avocado oil and quail eggs?

9530 2018-08-19 17:24:11 Honest i know this seems bad but please give it time.  I knocked a pan of boiling oil over, that wasn't a great out come.  It's frustrating, just don't rush, learn how to do things your way its the best way
9531 2018-08-19 17:24:11 Look esp. at clothes washing ingrediants, for $1 more, palm oil free
9532 2018-08-19 17:24:07 Totally.
I mean, living out here, no basic commodity is more than an hour's pay on minimum wage.
I noticed in Kenya a packet of unga, sugar, cooking oil etc. is a day's pay, sometimes even more!
9533 2018-08-19 17:23:21 Great idea, thanks! With thin hair it doesn’t take long for that oil to set in. While great for my hair, it’s not a great look.  I like the deep conditioning excuse, it’s not really a lie! Using our own natural oils for conditioning is healthy for our hair.

Also votes against women, is a climate-change denier, votes against NM public lands; he votes FOR oil/gas development and reverse robin hood tax policies that enrich him & his corporate donors and threatens NM's lands and water.
9535 2018-08-19 17:23:20 One time I drank crude oil
9536 2018-08-19 17:22:59 I forgot to charge for an oil change since you already have ur checkbook out
9537 2018-08-19 17:22:54 Chances of that ever happening in the next decade is slim to none. Our economy has to boom to the heights it was when oil was $150/barrel. With our current Anti-Canadian Oil Policies & protests, we can whistle dixie until the cows come home for that to happen!
9538 2018-08-19 17:22:35 Can’t say how many times someone has said to me ‘try cannabis oil’ because it’ll cure my husbands (incurable) lymphoma. The trouble is he’s in a fragile mental state so I have to work hard to say no. There’s no evidence. I have trouble not thumping people.
9539 2018-08-19 17:22:31 Spent $45 on the oil change yesterday
9540 2018-08-19 17:22:30 I grill pizza. I make raisin/rosemary flatbread on the grill. I grill more veggies than anything. Sweet Potato slices dipped in olive oil and salt. Okra cut in half, lengthwise. Honestly, I never liked hot dogs and it's such a dull thing to be grilling.
9541 2018-08-19 17:22:14 #whycantwelivetogether did before ever ungrateful zionists, given piece of Pal., stormed, displaced, stole, massacred, devastated, squeezed life out of; burned/cut down sacred olive trees; poisoned crop, stole oil, water; sprayed skunk water; denied, deprived, trapped, tracked
9542 2018-08-19 17:22:10 Are you really the ignorant...Trudeau gives away our oil and gass, allows foreign governments to take over our resources, gives millions and millions to special interest groups and his buddies' charities, and liberals destroyed our hydro company and sold it to outside investors!
9543 2018-08-19 17:22:09 I bet they only cost more because it's either new or not mass produced. Cornstarch isn't exactly a rare resource, while oil is pretty much becoming one. If there's lots of interest in this, this might as well replace plastic in certain situations
9544 2018-08-19 17:21:51 What's wrong with imported oil? I'm sure Iran are happy to export their oil (hence the sanctions). Western leaders actually SUPPLY the bombs to MURDER these People
9545 2018-08-19 17:21:31 Bros! Na Oil well be this na !
9546 2018-08-19 17:21:20 God anoint my head with oil so I can run over!!  #TOP
9547 2018-08-19 17:21:13 Guru Gobind Singh Ji had said,
" Even if a Muslim puts his hand in Sesame oil and then into Sesame (Tils) seeds and swear the number of times, as many seeds got stuck on his hand, then too Do not Trust that Muslim !"
- Guru Gobind Singh Ji, 9th Sikh Guru -
9548 2018-08-19 17:21:02 The oil is still nationalized and not why the US got involved. The guy was destroying the Shah which were pro western, they died off anyways, but to say we did it solely for nationalization of oil is incorrect. Clear example of how democracy was used by ppl to erode democracy.
9549 2018-08-19 17:20:46 I really dont give a sh*t about about his vaca time. I care about some of his policies. He needs to stop:
*Building pipelines
*Subsidizing oil companies
*Allowing tax evasion in tax havens & family trusts 
* delaying pharma are and dentacare
*fighting Indigenous in court

9551 2018-08-19 17:20:21 Better save every dollar for when the next BP oil spill happens or the next major national disaster weather event due to climate change connected to man made contributions.. Theres consequences to running business without rules.. America paid the price several years ago..

9554 2018-08-19 17:20:11 Successive UK Gov's should've retained an interest in every production licence, had a state-owned oil company and an oil fund investing to produce an income that would last for eternity if it were well managed, just like Norway has done. Scotland's deficit is Westminster's making
9555 2018-08-19 17:19:54 Rub small coconut oil on ur legs. Are u a chameleon
9556 2018-08-19 17:19:49 None of those are socialism. They all funded whatever benefits they provide from capitalism. They are also mostly homogeneous population, a fraction of the size of the US. How would you fund the $4 trillion a year cost of Medicare for all?  Norway funds will oil profits.

9559 2018-08-19 17:19:34 How is it cheatin...we have the resources to spend on players...i bet u wish yo team had the same resources  (yes oil money)...we are plyin the best football ever...so its a win from my side
9560 2018-08-19 17:19:32 Its all good bro. She just needs some oil and hopefully thats it
9561 2018-08-19 17:19:23 Having a passion has nothing to do with being successful. A friend lives in Tokyo and religiously follows the Oil while still running his business. I'm successful IMO and I spend time and energy on the Oilers chatter back and forth with my friends. It's a common passion we share

9570 2018-08-19 17:18:11 Leg quarter rub- (this was about 15 leg quarters)
Old bay, smoked paprika, garlic salt, black pepper, (about a teaspoon or so of each, I'm not real strong on measuring). Clean chicky, lightly coat in o.oil, then toss chicken in rub, let sit for an hour in fridge.
Smoked 275 3 hrs

9580 2018-08-19 17:16:47 2/2 on Oklahoma, the DOK's agenda and ink would rank higher than land runs, dust bowls, or oil, in one native Okie's opinion. The DOK's agenda and how it chose to use its power is its own story.

9582 2018-08-19 17:16:40 Snake oil salesman
9583 2018-08-19 17:16:37 Agree Trump is selling snake oil. But don’t think his goal is to get people in the tent.  It’s to steal riches from America and establish the powers of a tyrant.
9584 2018-08-19 17:16:24 Sadly, that was the disappointing thing. I never found myself reading anything and getting super hungry. But part of that is being a vegetarian. Matt likes a millet honey date oil porridge thing I tried based on it.
9585 2018-08-19 17:16:23 Looks like a oil painting.

9587 2018-08-19 17:16:12 It’s pretty good once I realized butter is just solid milk.

Some people put both coconut oil and butter, but I avoid coconut oil because I can’t eat too much fat.

9607 2018-08-19 17:13:07 Buy Low Now #XOM stock is being shorted hard, speculative traders are going to all have to exit their PUTs at the same moment, (short covering) the Q3 earnings will explode same moment the Iran oil price spikes occur, setting up a volatile Q4. I think upside is outweighing down
9608 2018-08-19 17:12:57 Guy at oil change place:  We are out of 10W/30 conventional oil, but we can use a synthetic grade?  We can get the conventional, but it will take a little longer.

Me: How much for the synthetic oil?

Guy: $99.00

Me: I will wait for you to get the conventional oil.
9609 2018-08-19 17:12:41 There is nothing wrong for him to take his share. I see crypto as future oil companies, they produce it, they distribute it and they have every right to keep some of it for themselves. That’s how I see Ripple & XRP, just in this case they provide liquidity instead of electricity.
9610 2018-08-19 17:12:36 Obama started Econ recovery frm where Bush left it
Trump lies about:

•Pre-existing conditions
•Helping middle class
•Tax cut will “hurt” him
•Environmental issues.
He:
•Gave nat’nl parks to big oil
•Deregulated banks
•Obstructed Justice
•Supports asbestos

9623 2018-08-19 17:10:34 Fiat is the issuing authority of the currency. Oil is an asset/capitalization of the currency. Although your point is interesting in light of CDO swaps being the dominant factor behind almost all US economic growth for decades now.

9641 2018-08-19 17:09:13 I don't know of any unionists who have ever said that, but it is the case that Alex Salmond's 2014 White Paper said that even with an oil price 2X higher than it is today, Scotland would have a multi-billion £ deficit that would have to be covered by borrowing.

9666 2018-08-19 17:07:17 The undeniable fact is that there is never any discussion of this fundamental fact on trade or jobs or inflation or in oil pricing or world diplomacy or anything else. You don't need to know anything else in order to see it is all just a show.

9673 2018-08-19 17:06:05 Be aware #XOM stock; makes more money when the oil differentials widen, and the currency gaps widen because they can buy low oil priced feedstock here in this low currency with that higher exch rate currency usd, then sell that oil over there at a gap up for significant % gains.
9674 2018-08-19 17:05:59 First coal, now oil, and toxic chemicals are OK too. Anyone take time to check out Trump's investment portfolio or business interests?

9676 2018-08-19 17:05:48 You're in a particular industry and socio-economic position. The crash in oil prices did have a massive effect on a lot of Albertans connected either directly or indirectly to the industry. 

That's the target of the UCP message
9677 2018-08-19 17:05:43 no te boludeo, pero te acordas del 2008 con los motores a gas oil?

9679 2018-08-19 17:05:42 $IPI Of course we follow oil& commodity prices. The real thing is management especially the CEO keeps buying buckets full of stock _Bullish

9685 2018-08-19 17:04:40 Fucking disgraceful. UK/USA govt. should speak out against this. But they won’t. Oil/ money trumps compassion.

Basic #truth is they're all blind, can't see through oil splatter on their glasses beyond their noses! Killing own citizens so we, the women with no conscience as u say, can have plastic. #Wakeup
9693 2018-08-19 17:03:31 TE acordás cuando en el 2008, trajeron esa partida de gas oil de venezuela con mala calidad con alto contenido de azufe y que nunca dijeron nada y rompieron todos los motores de los camiones, y los autos , jajajaja.  Como se hicieron los boludos los k .
9694 2018-08-19 17:03:25 As in: better not to eat meat? But a meat product certainly has no need of veg fats from far overseas with risks to habitat and deforestation when we already farm lots of pigs here. As for @coopukfood adding rapeseed oil (canola) to pork pies, this causes inflammation in humans.

9696 2018-08-19 17:03:17 Hi, Lauren! All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana & cannabis infused products such as CBD oil. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover them while screening your property.
9697 2018-08-19 17:03:17 Can do so much with that! Personal fav is to bake it with a little oil and seasoning

9720 2018-08-19 16:59:47 What if you don't oil your computer?
9721 2018-08-19 16:59:37 This is a travesty. tRump, Zinke, and the GOP are festering boils on the landscape of America. Oil and gas industry are eco terrorists. Fat freeloading meat ranchers are freeloading on public lands. The BLM is torturing and murdering our wild horses. This must stop.
9722 2018-08-19 16:59:09 They know why, and so do we: OIL, OIL & Natural Gas fossil fuel routes and co's (Saudi Aramco IPO price will go up with Yemen controlled to blockade Iran) so children's lives is a small price to pay, hey? With arms to UAE from US, Putin can get UAE investment in his Siberian LNG.
9723 2018-08-19 16:59:07 umm my dad just told me that he’s eventually going to have to stop telling me when i need to get an oil change so i can learn??? huh???
9724 2018-08-19 16:58:52 Mountain Dew! The brominated vegetable oil makes my innards more fire resistant.

9734 2018-08-19 16:57:16 No mention of oil anywhere? That seems odd.
9735 2018-08-19 16:57:12 Cab (or any dry red wine), 1/3 cup of oil oil and 3 cloves of crushed garlic. If you want a tangy flavor, add a tablespoon of Dijon. My dad uses beer as opposed to wine, but I usually use whatever red I’ve chosen for the evening  Use the mop as a baste during bbq’ing.

9746 2018-08-19 16:56:24 It is natural and expected to see average basin GOR trending up with the increasing backlog of completed wells. It would be an issue to see these GORs overshooting type curves. Permian main issue is what you call associated oil is most of the time condensate

9760 2018-08-19 16:54:29 Best solution I was given, get a  ceramic coded skillit. They said I didn't need oil/cooking spray with it, but I still coat it in olive oil. Eggs slide right off when serving, and way easier to clean.
9761 2018-08-19 16:54:04 Yep  Mine's been growing out of control and I cant groom it well anymore I need oil

9768 2018-08-19 16:53:05 Humans who continue to abuse nature will orchestrate their own extinction.  Better to sanction the purchase of anything containing palm oil.
9769 2018-08-19 16:53:00 If we start using coal, drilling for oil, gas, again, we won't be able to use it all up because humans will be dead. The hot dirty biosphere will have killed us all off. Already coastal regions under water, atmosphere hottest in millenniums, food sources dying.

9774 2018-08-19 16:52:18 I started using black soap for my face every night and my face completely changed from oily to combination in a matter of 1 month. Also Cliniques clarifying lotion acts as a toner and moisturizer which helps to get rid of oil without drying out the face too harshly.
9775 2018-08-19 16:52:06 Honest question. Do we get cheap oil in exchange for arms sales? Is this why nothing will ever get said about this type of thing?

9783 2018-08-19 16:50:38 2008ish I attended an eco conference here & interviewed a top banking exec (can’t remember name now) he went off on tangent saying when oil drops below 100 death & starvation would occur.

9786 2018-08-19 16:50:17 The sad thing is, most of the fans will inevitably blame Jose and not the Glazers.

At least Chelsea fans had the excuse of knowing they couldn’t jeapordize the dirty oil money by pissing off Roman.
9787 2018-08-19 16:49:58 And what would government do? By that logic, large insurance companies, big pharma, big oil, mainstream media, and banks are monopolies, and so we need more government involvement in all those. A faulty logic from a conservative.

9800 2018-08-19 16:48:06 From my new book, OIL and GOD:
GCC states shut their doors to brethren Syrian refugees. 
By contrast, Germany welcomed several hundred thousands. 
Also, 5 million Syrian refugees are registered with UNHCR in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, & Egypt.
9801 2018-08-19 16:47:44 It is the son of Sir Iain Wood KT GBE, the man who said oil was almost gone during indy, who runs it. That should tell you why!
9802 2018-08-19 16:47:43 Ask them if they can cook it in olive oil or canola. Most places with a real kitchen / chef will accommodate. We also always tip well... 
9803 2018-08-19 16:47:20 It's insane how this is even up for debate. I had this convo with my mom a couple weeks ago and she threw a fit. Like, mom...you will literally pour oil over my head while you "plead the blood of Jesus." What exactly do you think...
9804 2018-08-19 16:47:13 i need a hot oil massage i’m so tense :(
9805 2018-08-19 16:47:08 Thanks. It was the type of cooking where you just add bits as you go along (onions, chilli flakes, veg stock, sesame oil, ground white pepper, sweet pepper) and it turned out well. Hopefully I can remember & make it again sometime 
9806 2018-08-19 16:47:03 Something smells like spilled oil out here
9807 2018-08-19 16:46:56 Fun baking tips for you! If you want to use a box mix, sub your water for milk, use melted butter instead of oil, crack an egg in there, and LITERALLY no one can tell the difference between that and a bakery made cake.

9809 2018-08-19 16:46:47 Going on 5 hours for an oil change, tire replacement and rotation for a SCHEDULED appointment on my wife's car at Airport Jeep in Orlando. Crap like this makes me appreciate my @Tesla even more.

9815 2018-08-19 16:45:35 Are you saying that Lukaku and Matic haven’t performed?

Pogba can’t deny has been well below his ability and Jose has to bear a large part of the blame for that.

Tbh I would have Pep over Jose in a heartbeat, but would rather have the dirt oil money over both

9823 2018-08-19 16:44:40 Save for the inherent strength of the economy built by Dr MMS in 10 years, and a windfall crude oil price,  BJP would have scooted in 2015 itself. BJP owes it's coming to & surviving in power to Congress & Dr MMS..
9824 2018-08-19 16:44:33 Well they should stop talking about it and get in with it before Treasoner May and Oil Rag Robbins stitch us up with Brino. Those who do nothing are just as complicit if the witch gets away with her sell out plan.
9825 2018-08-19 16:44:29 Proven idea for salmon: Use a hot pan slightly covered by olive oil, fire on low, use fresh herbs and only fry it once you have fried the onions, garlic and herbs. Fry salmon on both sides. It won´t stick if you follow these instructions. And its taste is special.

BTW I did resurrect my old film camera (new battery, drop of oil on the shutter mechanism) and shoot some film recently. Quickly decided I was going B+W only. But still expensive and hard to try stuff as no idea if it worked.
9829 2018-08-19 16:44:13 So, you don't agree Saudi oil is best?

9831 2018-08-19 16:43:58 Oil, politics and violence by the same writer. I'll argue that book is better. The only place I could find a hard copy for the one you're reading is cassava republic. I don't know if they still have it in stock
9832 2018-08-19 16:43:48 I’d only recommend adding a dash of apple cider vinegar to everything and cooking with coconut oil because those are practically magic foods.
9833 2018-08-19 16:43:38 Farmhouse and Guild have actually double checked about cooking surfaces - they use a blended oil on the grill - so they will prepare our food in separate clean pans. Hen Of The Wood is awesome as well. I eat often at Mirabelles.

9841 2018-08-19 16:42:17 So guys... for curl definition... I find that mousse like argan oil mousse works better than all dem oils, creams, butters etc. It's lighter because it foams, it's not greasy. I just use it after I moisturize. It's not that super defined, wet look everybody seems to want tho.
9842 2018-08-19 16:41:59 Je viens d'apprendre que "huile de tournesol" se dit "annuus oil" en anglais
Je suis aux anges #thrilled #bumflower #huile #soleil
9843 2018-08-19 16:41:44 That's what they do.

The squeaking hinge gets the oil.

But if the hinge keeps squeaking it gets replaced.
9844 2018-08-19 16:41:40 I think I bought ben nye oil paints for EDI. You can use the sealant or powder to seal it.
9845 2018-08-19 16:41:38 It’s called a democracy, google the definition if you can’t figure it out. How much are you getting paid to try to block Canadian oil?
9846 2018-08-19 16:41:36 My disdain for TLJ is as engorged as inflamed hair follicles, but you should probably get you tea tree oil seeping pores checked out. That sounds uncomfortable.

9849 2018-08-19 16:41:04 I like the soothing smell of every essential oil except chypre, palma rosa, patchouli (I think the person sporting patchouli got stuck in the 60's). And lavender alone reminds me of elderly ladies with gloves, short hair and stories to tell.
9850 2018-08-19 16:41:02 From my new book, OIL and GOD:
By accepting Syria’s refugees, among whom are doctors, engineers, artists & other professionals, Germany acquired a sizeable human capital. At an average of $50,000 per person and 500,000 refugees, the human capital would be estimated at $25 billion
9851 2018-08-19 16:41:02 I fucked up my lips and they look SO crusty and I don't have anything oil based to take the lipstick off I'm doomed to look like a scarecrow  I'M SO ANNOYED BY THIS

9882 2018-08-19 16:37:10 It depends on your age and health. I’ve had 5 surgeries in the last 3 1/2 years. Being put to sleep so much has resulted in hair loss. I found a remedy from an FNP - caster oil - google it and follow the directions. Even w/o surgeries we lose hair as we age.
9883 2018-08-19 16:36:48 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
9884 2018-08-19 16:36:42 this dab oil is called shatter and I'd say it's a bit of a misnomer since its texture is like taffy and in no way could ever actually shatter at room temp
9885 2018-08-19 16:36:41 Think the situation has gotten out of hand. There are products seen on Supkt shelves overseas that falsely claims "Jamaican Jerk" or "Jamaican Castor Oil".
9886 2018-08-19 16:36:37 My brand new car that I’ve had for 5 months has been puked in 3 times, had a hole that let water leak into the trunk and now to top it off has oil spilled inside the trunk. I’m about to lose my fucking mind :-)

9888 2018-08-19 16:36:26 Why don't we pay citizens Royalties like Alaska does?

Why do private corporations get to exploit our oil, coal and national resources to enrich a few?

Instead of paying taxes, we should get a share of the wealth being generated from our assets.

@realDonaldTrump
9889 2018-08-19 16:36:14 Yes, an army with no legal obligation to not act in the U.S. See: Standing Rock. Oil company hired Tiger Swan. Tiger Swan brought guns in to aggravate protesters.
9890 2018-08-19 16:36:14 Amazing logic from a doctor turned gold and oil digger as an opposition spokesperson. Lame 
9891 2018-08-19 16:36:10 I’m proud of Alberta’s oil sands & the sustainability work being done to manage resource. We need to market this as a selling point why our products are the best. The question we all have to answer (including the other countries) is what do we do about irrefutable climate crisis?
9892 2018-08-19 16:36:04 Sooooo i had oil for the first time last night  and imma just leave that at that

9918 2018-08-19 16:32:43 It's more accurate to say that a vote for most Democrats is a vote for a Republican because Dems are more likely to vote with Reps than Greens are (military budget, immigrant detention, tax breaks, DACA repeal, oil subsidies, etc.)

9947 2018-08-19 16:30:05 That’s some bullshit , and motherfuckers wonder why I’m for separate but equal ! It’s like oil and water it will never mesh no matter how many whites listen to r&b while blacks do what mike Jackson did with surgery it won’t change mindsets
9948 2018-08-19 16:30:05 Hang on ill get the baby oil  x

9951 2018-08-19 16:29:39 Brings to mind the old @USNavy warning. Never get in a jet that isn't sitting atop an oil spot, because it means all of the oil has already leaked out.
9952 2018-08-19 16:29:26 next time will try oil AND Adobo.  I never thought of combining them 
9953 2018-08-19 16:29:02 The best part of waking uuuupppp, is flinging hot oil on your feet while trying to make a fried eeeeegggggg

9955 2018-08-19 16:28:42 I tried some beard oil, slight reduction to the itching but not much improvement to the course nature of the beard

9957 2018-08-19 16:28:31 Fox is already Trump TV. So is RT America and NRATV.  If he does have his own network it’s only sponsors will be snake oil and beet juice.
9958 2018-08-19 16:28:27 We need a logo or sign on goods containing palm oil, similar to the dolphin friendly tuna one.

9960 2018-08-19 16:28:17 That’s right. We have enough oil reserves here and overseas for YEARS.
9961 2018-08-19 16:28:16 Or "The Widow's Vessel," referencing that story where Elijah makes her bottle of oil self-filling. I'd patromize a coffee house that had bottomless refills!
9962 2018-08-19 16:28:11 How are the kids doing since you went your own way? 

Do women have a plan for a post oil world? 

America's value is on the back of oil so whats the plan? 

Oh yeah you never thought about that did you?
9963 2018-08-19 16:28:08 Ocasio-Cortez a threat to DNC, branding ad smithing.

ACA was just a DNC kickback machine never intending to cure the Commoner, but merely a Brand of quid pro quo, hidden as a moral imperative

Lack of cost containment and pharma group College suin says so.

9965 2018-08-19 16:27:51 My hair STAYS dry no matter how much oil I apply and atp idk what else to do
9966 2018-08-19 16:27:42 And Asia and Latin America have only had growth when they've resisted capitalism. Not really sure how Venezuela's socialist efforts to educate and provide healthcare caused a crash in oil prices (though the gov were naive to rely on that revenue for sure)
9967 2018-08-19 16:27:40 I still fail to understand how the EU is at fault. I understand the companies from countries are in the EU are at fault but that would be saying the UK was at fault for the BP oil spill (they were British Petroleum after all)
9968 2018-08-19 16:27:15 Bake w/drizzle of olive oil, & some salt/red pepper. Can eat a whole bulb for enjoyment, but also go to if infected/getting sick. Throw a couple of bulbs of garlic at what is invading you and it will take a hit for sure! Good for heart & so much more. Good health tastes good too!

9970 2018-08-19 16:27:01 Oil Arab countries have set plans to replace fuel- produced energy with nuclear plants by 2030 to reduce pollution whilst European will be shifting about the same time from nuclear to renewable energy to eliminate the risk of nuclear leak.When will Lebanon shift from fuel to gas
9971 2018-08-19 16:26:53 Have you seen the video about the bible pouring out oil? Lol
9972 2018-08-19 16:26:38 Exactly! Perhaps we get Energy East paper work buried in the contract and say it’s to move sewage waste water from QC to put on converted oil tankers to Vancouver Island to be “disposed” of via another pipeline into the Pacific Ocean??!!
9973 2018-08-19 16:26:21 Still is. The truth is that lots of people still haven't felt the recent boom because inflation has wiped out their wage gains. Of course Washington insiders exclude necessities like housing, gas, heating oil, food, etc, from CPI and they're telling us no inflation.
9974 2018-08-19 16:26:05 Abusing me doesn't affect me on this platform, so let's face the discussion.
Recession was not a PREDICTION, it was an OBVIOUS REALITY that anyone with common sense could see ahead when GEJ & NOI depleted reserve & FINISHED the entire oil income for 5yrs.
Wetin be prediction
9975 2018-08-19 16:25:56 Not by the amount of oil exported out of Westridge so far and certainly not by starting that nonsense now with the twinning of the line for that purpose.
9976 2018-08-19 16:25:52 Maleficent swayed her hips slightly to the music as she added oil and minced garlic to the pan on the stove before adding the tomatoes and juice and the rest of the vegetables.

9982 2018-08-19 16:24:21 So relaxed in my views that I am levitating with my legs crossed.  So relaxed in my spirit I am sipping Tevana Zen.  So relaxed in my disdain for what Star Wars has become that I am oozing Tea Tree oil from my pores.
9983 2018-08-19 16:24:15 Bro when I was in america once, some guy ordered oil as a sauce man. Not olive or anything, just oil. NA smh

9986 2018-08-19 16:23:58 Are you going to hit Trudeau with hard hitting questions about his foreign policies and ties to the oil industry?! Now's your chance, Matt!
9987 2018-08-19 16:23:56 Onions and garlic, parsley and olive oil in all the pans. Some will go in the freezer if I can find room. Some will go in our bellies!
9988 2018-08-19 16:23:54 Go ahead. Use it all. The world will be a better place when oil is dead and gone.
9989 2018-08-19 16:23:50 It's a lie they once said that to Afghanistan, Pakistan n Iran. USA is horny after oil resources/reserves. USA a greedy whore and an agent of Israel promoting n supporting wars and terrorism since forever 
9990 2018-08-19 16:23:48 We probably started off on the wrong foot Senator when I tried for weeks and weeks to get a reply to my counter of the #GPT numbers you posted.  Your LA eventually told me that my numbers were rigth & the Oil industry did lowball what money would be raised by increasing the GPT.

9993 2018-08-19 16:23:35 Most kinds of beard oil works well. Make sure you keep it at a length that's comfortable for you. Eventually, the constant itching will stop. Just takes some time.
9994 2018-08-19 16:23:24 Sure, getting your heart broken hurts, but have you ever gotten garlic oil in a fresh cut??
9995 2018-08-19 16:23:04 Lil Wayne... Look bae. I'll put some black Jamaican castor oil some real bb Judy miracle drops.  I'll rub your scalp daily just please oh please cut them and start over.
9996 2018-08-19 16:22:52 Don’t mistake silence for agreement ... this was while I was in the oil press.
9997 2018-08-19 16:22:45 exfoliating before u shave and shaving with coconut oil might help!

10003 2018-08-19 16:22:11 In a small way I feel sorry for the simpletons that actually believe what this grifter spews out of his mouth on a daily basis. Trump is a snake oil salesman trying to hang on by 1 lie after another.
10004 2018-08-19 16:22:06 Finance and oil ministers, please look into the pathetic and alarming situation of PSO and National refinary. Private sector is has registered profits in oil sector this year. Take some immediate steps to avoid further detoriation in profits.
10005 2018-08-19 16:21:46 เป็นไปได้ เพราะครูไม่บอกไรเราเลย 555
10006 2018-08-19 16:21:46 Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

Kemi Adeosun A LEARNER led the economic team under the supervision of Osinbajo in the midst of famine, moved reserve DEPLETED by GEJ & NOI, from $28B to $48B in 3yrs of selling d same oil for $50avg.
LEARNER!
10007 2018-08-19 16:21:12 Wow after 2 weeks my dad is finally changing my oil
10008 2018-08-19 16:21:10 I hope it’s olive oil mayo
10009 2018-08-19 16:20:52 I'm unconvinced taking bold action to affect oil companies' distribution methods will have the desired effect. I propose we take bold action to stop people buying/using vast amounts of oil by stopping purchase of fuel-inefficient vehicles & bolstering building standards #cdnpoli
10010 2018-08-19 16:20:48 The amount of emphasis international media including this clown gives to burka n hijab it feels lyk if world becomes burka free world will become peaceful, no one will sleep hungry, corruption will decrease, crime will eradicated, west willnt be oil hungry, no poverty in Africa
10011 2018-08-19 16:20:46 Never said I was against oil. Please learn to read. oil sands production is an environmental disaster. It should not be extracted. Our government sits by and let’s it happen while the rest of the world acknowledges it to be dirty oil
10012 2018-08-19 16:20:44 So you put them in a diffuser with some water, or you can rub them on your own skin but you have to dilute it with a carrier oil like coconut oil because it’s a very concentrated & can sometimes burn your skin if put directly on
10013 2018-08-19 16:20:40 The New York Times know what a complete sham, fraud and snake oil salesman you are... and it drives you nuts...
10014 2018-08-19 16:20:30 I believe that OIV is an oil volatility index based on the ratio of CBOE & NYMEX futures for WTI. OVX is volatility index based on just daily NYMEX WTI price. Not sure really.
10015 2018-08-19 16:20:22 But it wasn't a success (unless you're Chavez family, his daughter is worth $4bn), it only worked for a little while when oil prices were high and there was still a functioning underlying market economy. As time went on and policies got more extreme it completely imploded
10016 2018-08-19 16:20:14 You may think im crazy but make a roller with
patchouli essential oil 10d
Vanilla extract 20d
Carrier oil any
It smells like angel perfume 
Its discontinued but that vanilla patchouli mix was its base&its the only thing i could find close to a vanilla scent that wasnt chemical
10017 2018-08-19 16:20:13 The man has no shame. Makes a snake oil salesman look look.
10018 2018-08-19 16:19:56 “Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.”
