3 2018-04-24 23:39:14 sim, tem essa questão. Mas ainda acho que o fator que mais afetou, em termos de crise, foi o cenário internacional. As commodities caíram absurdamente, com brusca redução do preço do petróleo. O país é muito dependente das Commodities. Apenas agora que começam a subir o seu preço

42 2018-04-24 22:04:18 I did and I mean I think that people will have a hard signing on to massive social change that involves ending the production of commodities we rely on to survive.

71 2018-04-24 18:58:38 Notice stocks are dropping. Now is the time those stocks you have been eyeing while the price is down to buy. This was the big pattern that the richest men of the depression era practiced. They invested in previously pricey stocks and commodities and made even bigger fortunes.

116 2018-04-24 16:08:04 No, the continuing sale of commodities does not necessarily mean that the state is still in the hands of capital.
117 2018-04-24 15:53:43 Sorry to break this to you but the rule of capital involves selling commodities from supermarkets.
118 2018-04-24 15:48:14 Trust me. Food stamps are not that great unless you have 12 children. It is not a fair system. Better to get commodities. Everyone falls on bad times. We all need a lift sometimes. It's not a lifetime choice
119 2018-04-24 15:41:49 In this current culture of outrage, it’s good to remember that #kindness and #empathy are not commodities to be distributed only to those we like and agree with.
120 2018-04-24 15:38:48 Why is everything so goddamn expensive? I’m so sick of living in a place where necessities are priced as commodities
121 2018-04-24 15:33:48 Os fatores macro forçam a agitação dos ativos, em especial do dólar: expectativa do aumento da inflação global, devido subida agressiva de preço de commodities importantes como o petróleo, valida as probabilidades de um novo aumento da taxas de juros americana.

Grubhub, Peapod, Amazon Prime, etc. When you aren't pressed to deal with the general population, do you lose some of the empathy that comes with socializing?

141 2018-04-24 14:24:12 Another fun fact: Since January 2017 the price of diesel fuel has skyrocketed so much it will eventually result in higher prices for commodities/inflation than during Pres. Obama's 8 yrs.

234 2018-04-24 04:50:44 Stop talking from both ways. As soon as prices of food commodities increases cong is first amongst the protesters.

236 2018-04-24 04:44:14 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.
237 2018-04-24 04:43:29 Cmdty, oil: DoubleLine's Gundlach suggests going long SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF at Sohn Conference. Gundlach has been touting commodities as favoured investment this year bc historically rally late in econ cycles
238 2018-04-24 04:34:37 We got commodities when I was a kid. We also got food stamps but my mom had to pay cash and then got double the amount of stamps. $30 cash for $60 in stamps. Waiting in line for the canned pork, block of cheese, large can of peanut butter and sometimes eggs was humiliating.....
239 2018-04-24 04:31:50 Can we see what all the journalists at CNBC are invested in? It is a show reporting on equities, commodities, currencies, etc. So if the journalists all invested in ETF’s or mutual funds, would they want us to know?

#Hindalco 235, -8%
#Vedanta 294, -4%
One of fleetest rise and fall for these stocks.
Usually commodities trend up or down steadily. Not this time.
#Trump games!
241 2018-04-24 04:24:05 Lmao this old dude on a Nollywood film just told this lady “In this whole village, you and your mother are the cheapest commodities.” Africans can insult my goodness.
242 2018-04-24 04:23:08 @narendramodi Modisir, please look at fuel prices. Fuel prices are going high and high. Due to this all commodities are pricing more and common man can not really afford.
243 2018-04-24 04:23:06 Turkeys gobbling and deer rutting is why I trade commodities from Rodney, Ms. I don’t get lonely and damn sure ain’t scared of the dark.
244 2018-04-24 04:12:05 @cnbcSri @_HadleyGamble Goodmorning Thanks for show , i think this year is all about commodities esp. Oil rather than technology like chipset or etc!
245 2018-04-24 04:11:46 Is it true that trading to the extent where youre reliant on others to manufacture almost all of your needs/wants, then the need to grow more and more raw commodities for export to pay for them could be the reason for the pollution and destruction of our planet.. along with war?
246 2018-04-24 04:10:00 Sure, the cost of the commodities will rise when the cost of the transportation will rise automatically. A big blow to common man.
247 2018-04-24 03:44:24 Probably because those cities or areas contribute commodities that keep business running, like fuel for example.
248 2018-04-24 03:18:04 A4) Every action has a reaction on multiple facets...overall, Im not sure one came out better than the others. I think it depends on if youre measuring commodities sold, supply & demand over the last 25 yrs & lost/increase jobs.  #WTFarmchat

251 2018-04-24 03:11:05 It is declared to be the policy of Congress, as a measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation’s children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities and other food
252 2018-04-24 03:10:33 A6) Decrease trade resulting in an overabundance (adding insult to injury in some cases) of commodities, driving prices down even further. Not good. #WTFarmchat
253 2018-04-24 03:09:41 Take at look at how many existing securities there are. Stocks, bonds, funds, commodities, etc. There will be many more blockchains
254 2018-04-24 03:06:41 Envelopes, Telephones are both standardized and commodities. Datacenters are less standardized (k8?) but still a commodity (linode, hetzner, google, amazon, azure..). Same for the posix OS.. a commodity. If you run FreeBSD or Linux.. it doesn't matter to the contributor..
255 2018-04-24 02:44:26 Graciela Fernández Meijide dijo algo muy razonable en TN:que a ella le hubiese agradado que NK/CFK,aprovecharan viento de cola,precio de commodities
Y eliminaran desigualdades,realizaran obras públicas y crearan fondo anticíclico
Por el bien del país
Agrego:pero se robaron TODO!
256 2018-04-24 02:42:07 PQP quanta hipocrisia essa conta não pertence ao Temer quer enganar quem?PT no poder apostou no populismo  deixou de fazer o dever de casa deixou passar o boom das commodities,deixou passar a janela da reforma tributária,eleitoral, penal apostou todas as fichas em ficar no poder
257 2018-04-24 02:37:21 El espanto y miedo infundido x los ogm+agrotoxicos (commodities) que nos circundan se vuelven frágiles ante las manos de pueblos unidos y organizados

258 2018-04-24 02:33:35 Allende fue el mejor presidente, le devolvió la dignidad al país renacionalizando commodities estratégicos, además de aumentar la escolaridad, se preocupó por la infancia la leche diaria en las escuelas, campesinos (reforma agraria) devolviendo las tierras al que la trabaja.
259 2018-04-24 02:28:25 Like body snatchers, commodities and images have hijacked what we once naïvely called reality. The authentic nature of the products we make with our hands and the relationships we make with our words have been removed, replaced by their simulacra.”
260 2018-04-24 02:28:12 #arth485 Wages for artists sponsored by the Federal Art Project enabled artists, like Lawrence, to create art as a means to showcase culture, at a time when many artists could not otherwise afford to so, rather than act as simply "commodities" to be sold to the highest bidder
261 2018-04-24 02:22:11 There r lot issues going in the nation. You may talk about the current problem faced by the people due to poor administration of modi. As a ecomomist you may think abt essential commodities price high. Poor n middle class people were affected. Why u always talking abt PC only?
262 2018-04-24 02:03:07 #DebateUBAgrarias [...] y al mismo tiempo los compradores y vendedores conocen perfectamente el comportamiento del mercado. Gracias a estas características, se agrupa a la producción de huevos frescos en la categoría "commodities"
263 2018-04-24 01:59:45 However, the one commonality seems to be that democracy is overwhelmed by the power of money, whether by Russian oligarchs, Western billionaires, or oil rich ME potentates. America now has the best government money can buy, its politicians and citizens marketable commodities.
264 2018-04-24 01:58:11 Quoted ‘Roses’ by @kanyewest tonight in class @TheNewSchool when discussing human value and commodities.  #gradschoolchronicles
265 2018-04-24 01:56:06 The NEW DAY (CNN = Cryptic No News) is that we ARE NOT self-afflicted commodities of a World that just fades away. Obeying souless crutches are EXACTLY what they need. #QAnon #USA 
266 2018-04-24 01:31:13 Buy it. Of we get some inflation usually a good item for them. Plus with commodities doing well should help their exports

268 2018-04-24 01:11:36 For those people that think gold is a commodity. Shut down all those gold mines and you will still have lots of gold supply. Shut down any other commodities mines all at once and there will be no supply. So the question is, if gold is not a commodity what is it?
269 2018-04-24 01:06:50 Imagina “isso tudo” sem a picaretagem, a canalhice, os corruPTos & incomPTentes sugando o Estado e surfando a onda das commodities em alta! Imagina o que seria se essa corja tivesse um pouco mais de consciência dessa oportunidade de mudar o BR? É só por isso que eu odeio o PT!

271 2018-04-24 00:49:25 Con el precio de las commodities el único que no salía de esa era el Chueco. Argentina fue como Peter Griffin. Ganamos la lotería pero nos fuimos a la quiebra igual...

275 2018-04-24 00:47:06 It's only because I live in a state that is only 2nd to California in terms of how many commodities we produce. Cherries, blueberries are some of our top products. #WTFarmchat
276 2018-04-24 00:46:50 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
277 2018-04-24 00:46:48 It must bring such joy to the hundreds of thousands who declared bankruptcy last year due to medical bills that they're not being treated as commodities.
278 2018-04-24 00:39:08 “Customers”!!! Says it all. This Neoliberal framework is failing on every level & perverting the way we think. Our citizens labelled as “customers”, absolutely disgusting! We are just customers, consumers & commodities to them. Dehumanised. One step away from collateral damage 
279 2018-04-24 00:21:14 Shocking...
Meanwhile, the "tax break" that was given to the rest of us mortals is nothing but a political hand job. It's all been washed away with higher fuel prices, food prices, commodities, and services. Plus, as an added bonus, they expire in less than two years. #sad4usa
280 2018-04-24 00:17:50 A1) Yes, I believe it has by providing trade opportunities for commodities which might otherwise be in over supply. While supporting your country is important, worldwide trade is essential in the big picture due to the diversity in products. #wtfarmchat
281 2018-04-24 00:12:14 A1 NAFTA has been beneficial. Canada, Mexico is Michigan's top 2 trading partner for ag commodities. Having friendly trading partners has been very good for Michigan ag. #WTFarmchat
