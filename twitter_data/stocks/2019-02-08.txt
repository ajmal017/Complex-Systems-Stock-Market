More importantly, does New Zealand have enough stocks of Popcorn & are the servers that run Parliament live stream up to it?

44 2019-02-08 23:47:10 The funny thing is - Stretch also took 7 stocks, but I took them at an arguably more vital time
45 2019-02-08 23:47:01 Uncertainty seems to be all over the markets. Which is why tech specifically stocks have suffered - and I believe the volatility and quick changes that characterize the gaming are making more investors nervous.

47 2019-02-08 23:44:46 buying up stocks would very disproportionately benefit the already wealthy.

Giving it to ordinary people would be ok, but I'll be vastly surprised if it happens.
48 2019-02-08 23:44:03 fair play, renz will now flex his nature stocks at you.
49 2019-02-08 23:39:53 Basically because rest 1- is instant while wobbling takes several seconds of basically nothing happening to end; 2- is quite hard to land (whereas wobbling is a glorified grab); 3- is a massive commitment (even if you do land it, you’re probably trading stocks for it).

76 2019-02-08 23:17:53 so he bought  green stocks too it seems
77 2019-02-08 23:17:24 To be honest. I never thought the Russians took you seriously 
Now, what about these accusations of using your position to increase the value of specific.stocks that you own ?
78 2019-02-08 23:16:19 I think some folks comment and then retweet so their comment to his tweet will go out.  I have no idea about the likes. I’ve liked maybe 2, since 2016. Maybe one. (When he said he was going to ban bump stocks).

I’ve become somewhat immune... I expect the worst. But I do get it.
79 2019-02-08 23:15:25 Yeah, I wouldn't sell the stocks of a company where the board turns into lunatics either.

84 2019-02-08 23:11:01 $XBI $IBB  The way hedge funds short biotech so heavily (basically, all the time in between news events), every biotech should take the opportunity to raise capital on every significant move higher because their stocks will inevitably sell off afterwards due to these shorts.
85 2019-02-08 23:10:54 Seems like they are intent on a bitcoin-like bubble for stocks. When this thing goes down it's going to be unforgettable.
86 2019-02-08 23:10:51 Unearned wealth is by those collecting money off of stocks/bonds that they were able to invest in because they were born into the wealth. The unearned wealthy pay a smaller effective tax rate because cucks have been sold on the trickle down theory and voted in associated asshats.

88 2019-02-08 23:09:57 Gold and foreign stocks. Or sit in cash. I don't have a big portfolio but I bought a closed end fund that's all India equities, nice discount to NAV. Gundlach likes India, great demographics, better rule of law and property rights than its peers.
89 2019-02-08 23:09:30 250ml tins of Weather Shield masonry paint just £1 for any 4 tins.

90 2019-02-08 23:09:20 Quite an interesting read, especially with how Alex has taken off. Will be interesting to see what happens with EA stocks.
91 2019-02-08 23:07:43 Uh, @AOC is going get herself censured. Some of her mentors are in that group she talked about. You can’t earn millions on a salary of $174k or even $224k, right @SpeakerPelosi ? Didn’t you earn millions on your hubby’s stocks?
92 2019-02-08 23:05:59 You make a very good point!
93 2019-02-08 23:05:41 Oh no, Elon references 4:20. Stocks crash. End of the world imminent.
94 2019-02-08 23:05:29 Bump stocks definitely make the rifle they are fitted to much less accurate, and much less accurate than a true automatic.
95 2019-02-08 23:04:36 It was a great set up. We have to trade these stocks, but sometimes we get burned.

I don’t think you’re a financial news outlet for stocks not on your list. Seems like gloating , which is beneath your amazing skills.
99 2019-02-08 23:04:00 30 round magazines are standard on AR and AK platform rifles, not some extended mag. Bump stocks do not make a semi auto, automatic but I know you know that. I'm neither for against them. Probably fun and laughs when you have a 50 acre property and use them.
100 2019-02-08 23:03:56 This is where I feel young gamers could actually outplay Wall St in these stocks.  There was a brief window in time where it was apparent #ApexLegends was going to explode & $EA was still in the doghouse.
101 2019-02-08 23:03:33 Sure.  Growth stocks are a tricky business.

104 2019-02-08 23:02:14 Money match me fox vs falco 2 stocks to 4
105 2019-02-08 23:00:15 I agree with current price is too close to its all time high. Too much risk for reward, there are much better opportunities in other stocks
106 2019-02-08 22:57:56 Uh yeah...net worth would include that $320M in cash and.... all of his real estate including hotels, golf courses, residential properties, stocks, automobiles. These are all included in net worth. Not just the cash he has there smart guy.
107 2019-02-08 22:57:51 I dont care if Democrats control everything   2017 was crypto 2018 2019 weed and 2019 2020 5g stocks except 5g has real business and consumer use cases
108 2019-02-08 22:57:44 It all seem to meet at wall street and the wealthy stock holders campaign contributions plus members of Congress can own stocks in companies that rule over thru Congress making themselves rich and it is legal.the system is broken the people have to vote out the peopleprotectingit
109 2019-02-08 22:57:14 I think he’s a Klay type defender where box scores aren’t gonna capture his value well on that end since he doesn’t get stocks or rebounds for his position, but he definitely bothers guys which is harder to pin down.
110 2019-02-08 22:57:13 I've been doing it for years basically buy when they're low. Be careful buying stocks under $5 per share and keep your money in long term don't be scared if it goes down even 25% what goes down must come up especially bigger companies and you have to be patient 18 month+ is ideal
111 2019-02-08 22:53:29 You should be doing both...... never put all your investment eggs in one basket.  Trust me..... Baskets break and when the economy tanked? stocks dropped further than home prices. . .

127 2019-02-08 22:46:28 Also, I almost only miniprep (instead of midi's or maxi's- less time) and I routinely spike directly from my glycerol stocks into my miniprep culture. Making the glycerol stock takes essentially negligible time/money instead of retransforming, picking a colony, growing it, etc.
128 2019-02-08 22:46:11 Ouais j'imagine... J'ai une copine qui avait intégrée l'entreprise un peu après la transition, elle m'avait racontée des trucs de oufs... Genre problèmes avec les ordis, stocks qui arrivaient avec plusieurs semaines de retard...
129 2019-02-08 22:46:10 as an example, one could have been long European stocks for a long time (at the expense of US stocks) and that would have been a dud (in fact getting worse over time)...or am i misunderstanding this totally ? :)
130 2019-02-08 22:46:08 I think you're right. The "stocks are cheap" crowd seems to grow every week. And in the world of MMT they have a point. At least half of the Street feels like they were robbed of 3,000. They feel entitled to it.
131 2019-02-08 22:46:04 Invest it in stocks. It’s a good time.
132 2019-02-08 22:46:03 I don't think margins are a key metric given that these are growth stocks and priced as such.  I'd rather own the co's with bigger top line opportunities.  I don't expect TWTR's to get higher margins than FB and GOOGL on a normalized basis. They are underinvesting if anything
133 2019-02-08 22:45:21 We have far more abuse of the system by the rich and corporation, than all those lazy people you tout about. Last year Amazon paid zero taxes. Wallmart, Verizon, AT&T etc around 10% we know many use buyback of their own stocks, have offshore accounts and cheat if they can

138 2019-02-08 22:43:40 Totally worth making the glycerol stock! I made glycerol stocks religiously at the very start and very end of my PhD, but I fell off the wagon for the middle portion. I totally wish I had maintained it throughout. Saves a lot of time and money than re-transforming a -20 aliquot.

141 2019-02-08 22:41:36 CEO’s don’t become ridiculously rich off of just their salary. They are awarded stock incentives which awards them a certain number of stocks which they can then sell after the company does better.

145 2019-02-08 22:37:51 Can we ask what position this White man holds in bank stocks?
146 2019-02-08 22:37:26 They'll see a rise in their stocks and the value of the two companies will outshine YG and SM. So yea other companies will be in trouble if they do merge. The only thing I see that'll be troublesome are dating rumors. They had some due to dispatch but who knows what will happen.
147 2019-02-08 22:36:13 Years ago I read the suggestion that, instead of banning the sale of ivory, governments should sell their stocks of confiscated ivory, flood the market to bring down the price, so making poaching less profitable.
148 2019-02-08 22:35:41 The office stocks Miss Vickie's, but I dig Lay's, Kettle Brand, and Zapp's too.

149 2019-02-08 22:34:46 Yes there was a sex swing and restraints on the and stocks and some kind of cross to attach people to, it was all perfectly normal until photo 36 hahaha
150 2019-02-08 22:34:15 today when stocks were at their low, there was just a smallest rumor floated out that maybe these trade talks are back on. All of the suddon within the blink of an eye the market went up. Then throughout the day it was continued buying with a big surge to the close.
151 2019-02-08 22:33:48 I do not have an actifry - someone said if you have a convection oven you don't need one.  And i do also have a slow cooker that I've had forever.   The instant pot I use to make soup stocks, curry dishes (chicken or beef), pulled pork, stew etc :)

158 2019-02-08 22:32:12 And part of the preparation is that everybody stocks up and goes home early, but people make fun of us for this, even though it's due to a bunch of factors that aren't present or are statistically larger issues in their city.
159 2019-02-08 22:30:03 central bankers are panicking about a very rapid global slowdown while US stocks are not that far from their ATHs
160 2019-02-08 22:29:27 When a stock does well, it’s easy to attribute it to flawless execution factors such as the ones you’ve cited. How about when the stock is down? So take @BoxHQ or many other stocks that have cratered - are we to conclude that they are botching execution? I don’t think so.

180 2019-02-08 22:17:00 The scarier truth is we are also ignoring plastics flooding our oceans, fish stocks collapsing, sixth mass extinction, Amazon and other forests being destroyed, coral reefs dying... Our planet is literally being destroyed.

187 2019-02-08 22:10:30 What’s your opinion on 30 rd magazines and bump stocks? Should fully auto be available to the public?  I’m just asking questions of a gun enthusiast like your self.   I know how people on the other side feel. Is a national gun registry the biggest fear?

(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market stocks halted a six-week rally amid concern over the outlook for U.S.-China trade talks and a global economic slowdown. The reduced appetite for risk also sent currencies down.

227 2019-02-08 21:41:37 If you get income by working, that income is taxed.

If you get income from selling real estate or stocks, that income is not taxed. Inheritance income is not taxed.

Why? Because it's income only available to rich people. That's the *only* reason.
228 2019-02-08 21:41:11 What are the implications? ECB, BOJ & PBoC going down the same path? ”All in” in stocks...? Seems to suit several EWT-analysts that expect new rallies around the corner and a complete crash sometime around 2030...

244 2019-02-08 21:35:04 Well I dont know what they are teaching nowadays, but back when I was 11B I dont think we put our stocks on our shoulders like that in pretty much any situation. I guess we use drones more than effective tactics now?
245 2019-02-08 21:34:00 Look into what stocks they own. And read the small print on leftover campaign money. And then checkout just how many ppl in Congress suddenly feel like starting their own non profit/charity resembling “Foundation”

259 2019-02-08 21:24:23 Trump is about to learn a lesson that Nixon learned all too well. 

Graham and Bradley had guts and some money, 

Bezos has the most money and it turns out, gargantuan balls as well. 

If this just got personal, Trump’s goose is cooked. 

Buy popcorn stocks!
260 2019-02-08 21:24:16 You know they get serious when you see stocks built into the bed.

262 2019-02-08 21:24:02 It a generalization yet this self absorbed demographic need to just think themselves lucky they have had such generous tax breaks for so long. I’d say the majority in the room are probably climate change deniers as well. Share portfolios full of Bank & Oil stocks !!
263 2019-02-08 21:23:51 Hmm i have some stocks in the CSE to sell her
264 2019-02-08 21:22:38 @Keubiko great response. I made millions in fingerprint and this is on of the best stocks doing same run. Do your research before you talk
265 2019-02-08 21:20:06 Great job by analysing a global counterpart. Personally I think in India, QoQ results have been taken more seriously and not YoY. I think GI is grossly undervalued at around 3-3.5x PE. It's a forward looking sector and the stocks will find the real upward value soon.

271 2019-02-08 21:17:11 There was a rail boom that sent Stocks soaring. Is that what socialists want ?
272 2019-02-08 21:17:00 If we imposed a tiny tax on the sale of stocks, bonds, derivatives, and other investments, it could raise $110 billion to $403 billion according to @EconomicPolicy.

This financial transaction tax could also limit the risky investments that caused the financial crisis.

276 2019-02-08 21:15:52 we all marvel at the extraordinary and heroic measures taken by every major world CB but especially the US CB, to prop assets as this is the only thing keeping everything alive. Yellen said if stocks go it all goes. I guess this believe it. Massive ignorance

280 2019-02-08 21:14:03 Stocks rally from morning slump to end mixed, but eke out gains for the week.

Dow slips 63, -0.25% to 25,106.

S&P +0.07%, Nasdaq +0.14%.

Many techs show strength, though $AMZN loses 1.6%. Financials are a weak spot.

For the week Dow +0.17%, S&P +0.05%, Nasdaq +0.5%

283 2019-02-08 21:12:18 I might as well get the cure fuck it if it's happening anyway (that healthcare stocks fall) that way they rise I figured, you can't afford to fuck with me and keep things the same then tell them Becky Lynch is refusing medical attention

285 2019-02-08 21:10:59 I don't trade SPX directly but stocks within it, so your insight to SPX helps me a great deal with confirmation of what I'm in. Again thank you sir. Hope you have a great weekend.
286 2019-02-08 21:10:28 These stocks that were launch list candidates I traded this week have pulled back nicely .. got some in my 401K $MOD $MTW $GMS
287 2019-02-08 21:09:54 Kudos to Barry @icemantrading for his monster $EYEN win the past week. He went long just over a week ago with some size and stock doubled in that time frame. Amazing how he is able to “eye” those stocks that might have huge potential. Congratulations! #ITA
288 2019-02-08 21:08:21 "bump stocks offered a workaround by continuously pushing the trigger of a gun back against a shooter’s finger after firing."

No. They. Don't.
289 2019-02-08 21:07:02 #MarketWrap Major indexes close mixed as earnings help stocks pare earlier losses on trade, global growth concerns.

291 2019-02-08 21:06:10 Account closed today at YTD high and all time high. Bitcoin plays might be the focus next week, with some smaller OTC #PotStocks still worth swing trading a few weeks out. General market and leading pot stocks likely to still struggle with volatility though.
292 2019-02-08 21:06:00 The S&P500 is trading as if it's just not worth the effort today today, to be at 2708.0 (+0.07%).. Major movers PM +4.27% and UNH -2.68%. Who wants icecream? #icecream #stocks
293 2019-02-08 21:05:16 They closed the opening gap at the bell with $SPX, $RUT, & $NDX ending in the green. Perhaps the great correction of 2019 is now over.  #Trading #stocks #Futures $TLT $ZN $TNX $ZB $TYX $NQ_F $ES_F $VIX

297 2019-02-08 21:04:18 We already have background checks and bump stocks are a stupid novelty that no one cares about. Armed and competent citizens are the best safeguard.
298 2019-02-08 21:03:28 Yeah I have stocks missing from my account
299 2019-02-08 21:03:07 You wanna know why energy stocks don't look so impressive?
300 2019-02-08 21:03:03 That is why it is necessary to abandon the "job creation" model because it's low-key a slave generation machine by creating cheap labour. But we know that won't happen lol. By the way ther is enough money, stocks, natural resources for all to own and continue living in dignity
301 2019-02-08 21:02:56 Better buy as many stocks as you can now before your socialist heroes take it all away.
302 2019-02-08 21:02:32 Just the way it is. What’s worse, stocks trade on this skimpy stuff.
303 2019-02-08 21:01:55 Bump stocks or semi-automatics? Sheesh!
304 2019-02-08 21:00:52 The number sectors that saw an improvement of stocks making a new 1 week high fell across 23 of the 24 sectors. #toppingformation. .$SPY
305 2019-02-08 21:00:44 Bump stocks are only a tool. They contain neither a "good", or a "bad" soul, as they're an inert item. Banning them is useless, unless the banning of human fingers are included as well. Human fingers are capable of creating the same results. Research for video evidence, as proof.
306 2019-02-08 21:00:12 Wow, stocks closed green. Fed's gotta hike!
307 2019-02-08 20:59:23 Mine is a FAQ about investing in weed stocks.
308 2019-02-08 20:58:38 Have you checked your stocks lately???
309 2019-02-08 20:57:31 3) Q1 demand average ~ 37% of what turns out to be total demand.
4) 18-19 Total supplies = 5.002 bb, Q1 demand ~ 1.266 bb (you do the math)
5) What ending stocks number do you come up with?
6) How does that compare to USDA's es proj + shipment shortfall?
There you got it for free

312 2019-02-08 20:53:48 ...interact of Michigan really was harassing me which is why healthcare stocks took dive earlier in the week
313 2019-02-08 20:53:20 Same but stocks only. Find your nitch. Plus I got other stuff to do.
314 2019-02-08 20:53:15 Seems to me that more people have blood on their hands than the NRA. Who, among say recent presidential candidates, had major holdings in healthcare co stocks back in the 90's?
315 2019-02-08 20:52:45 Well, Well!
I am gonna spend some money now to buy two stocks: $AGN and $SPOT!
316 2019-02-08 20:52:33 Dude stocks are fucking wild. You can invest in gold. Just like, gold as a concept.
317 2019-02-08 20:52:21 Class that mate. Jace and me just watched it. Pissed himself when he saw the our Steve in those stocks. Naturally out of the bottle  fantastic once again boys 
318 2019-02-08 20:50:26 In the WASDE tables (page 28), that is correct. USDA overhauled multiple years worth of data for BR/AR, so the 2017/18 world ending stocks came down to 98 mmt. But if you look at it in local mktg years (which I prefer), 18/19 beg stox for just AR+BR came down 8 mmt from Dec.
319 2019-02-08 20:49:05 What if we made the ruleset be that you can only wobble for 2 stocks per game
320 2019-02-08 20:48:06 I find this stock market shit bullshit all the downward trend stocks are the reverse of the positive stocks. They are peaking and declaring at similar rates. 
321 2019-02-08 20:47:40 Little impact isn't no impact. It doesn't impact it because poor people spend it. If they invest it yr after year in stocks, bonds, or housing it would have a bigger impact. But nonetheless, it helps. Again. Visit Jamaica if u think the ultra rich should hoard their money.
322 2019-02-08 20:46:54 This, except for stocks
323 2019-02-08 20:46:52 Just bought some copper and gold stocks for the low. Price of Copper and Gold are going to rebound/shoot up over the next 5 years. Get on it

P.S. Remember when I told yall about the Cannabis stocks?
324 2019-02-08 20:45:56 Gold stocks doing numbers again 
325 2019-02-08 20:45:27 I doubt the network effect. Somalis continued to accept the old schillings in the hope they would be redeemed some day by a new government, which is what actually happened. The appropriate parallel here are penny stocks/bonds.
326 2019-02-08 20:45:15 It’s not insider trading if you do it in public. It’s only insider trading if you use your knowledge of something about to happen to save yourself. But using your office to enrich your stocks? Nope. That’s fair game.
327 2019-02-08 20:44:42 Will hold some crypto stocks into next week. Keep watching these:

$MARA $DPW $RIOT $NETE
328 2019-02-08 20:44:20 Yes, I knew, because they sold it as making taxes EASIER to do, & DOUBLING the standard deduction (which is only one line item). Then they took away enough other deductions to make itemized deductions not feasible for most. Only the wealthy can benefit from lower rates on stocks.
329 2019-02-08 20:44:12 = how to push stocks higher. Buy them and dump them later. Their mission is to support stocks.

335 2019-02-08 20:42:44 The first book that I am aware on the subject was "The Investor's Quotient: The Psychology of Successful Investing in Commodities & Stocks" by Jake Bernstein. I read it about 38 years ago. LOL
336 2019-02-08 20:41:55 Inevitably nearly all healthcare stocks are gonna fall
337 2019-02-08 20:41:18 Why are we not appreciating everything we wanted in a manger from OLE whiles stocks last.
338 2019-02-08 20:41:07 Ima just stop investing in stocks till Trump out of office
339 2019-02-08 20:40:59 @POTUS 
2018 was a record-setting year. Unfortunately, that’s because it was actually the worst year for stocks since 2008.
340 2019-02-08 20:40:27 Dooba Dooba rehta hoon... Song I heard back of my mind when I saw stocks today..
341 2019-02-08 20:39:23 Personally I think we are way too strong economically to have a recession right now. We also over react on the Dow whenever the Fed speaks. That being said I am out of stocks until I get a clear signal.
342 2019-02-08 20:39:22 Forbes has this “the worlds billionaires” ranking that paints a pretty neat picture of how this works over the years.
Printing keeps it afloat by initiatives such a QE, buying up debt and zombie stocks, inducing more and more liquidity into overblown markets ...
343 2019-02-08 20:37:56 Hmm. Just got a call from my bank. A pending sell order I had on one of my stocks was cancelled because, I suppose, all trading on that stock has been halted.
I have 100,000 shares in this stock. If I sold now, I'd make a decent amount.
What does this all mean?
344 2019-02-08 20:36:45 somebody teach me stocks and shit

347 2019-02-08 20:36:02 Switch in penny stocks can sometimes do  - as an example; if someone got into $CANN at 0.24 and exited at 0.36 in three days that’s 50% gain and then scoops up $LDS.c as it was sitting at perfect buying spot after a recent rip and lo and behold it shoots up 17% #StudyTheCharts
348 2019-02-08 20:35:16 it's because all of you republicans hold stocks in drug companies!

353 2019-02-08 20:32:01 @DougKass action not that bad in some stocks. Should be an interesting close.
354 2019-02-08 20:31:45 Tune in to @FoxBusiness around 4:00 p.m. ET: Jeff Saut is scheduled to be on to discuss how trade negotiations with China continue to drag down stocks.

356 2019-02-08 20:31:23 A sovereign wealth fund (SWF) or sovereign investment fund is a state-owned investment fund that invests in real and financial assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, or in alternative investments such as private equity fund or hedge
357 2019-02-08 20:30:19 Free Market?? Those stocks that were public are not on the market anymore!!
358 2019-02-08 20:30:13 Stocks rebound like this all the time after being oversold. People downloading a free game isn't going to save EA and is only taking gaming in the exact direction that gamers cry about all day on social media.
359 2019-02-08 20:29:20 It was more about Boston last night be careful you don't get fooled, I still need to see more before I buy stocks in LA.  We will see! I think Boston is a mess right now!
360 2019-02-08 20:28:29 Just a macro view point here. A recession is coming it could be in 3,6 or 12 months but it’s coming. Stocks fall at least 40% in a reg recession. In this case it should be a lot worse. Markets haven’t gotten this news yet.
361 2019-02-08 20:27:33 Many REIT stocks are doing well (low rates/Fed helping): $PLD $RHP & $ARE are best in breed
362 2019-02-08 20:27:33 The wait is over.......Does it have to be? In the real modern era toy company stocks are getting creamed, hard to imagine any toy company forking out the type of money to mass produce a doll that advanced. In the words of the REAL CHUCKY "A True Classic NEVER goes out of style."
363 2019-02-08 20:27:09 Stocks on hand of wheat aren't broken down?  I understand acreage intentions.  Am more interested in stocks of HRS.  Canada has had a run on HRS, wondering if same in USA?  Market today almost eliminated March/May carry.  Demand on the horizon?
364 2019-02-08 20:26:15 Not sure why banning bump stocks will help curb rifle use
365 2019-02-08 20:25:42 He was coached. He absolutely only spoke direct about southern boarder. (He’s got stocks in steel?)
366 2019-02-08 20:25:29 VP Mike, @realDonaldTrump , anti Second Amendment Barr does not deserve to be AG. Just another socialist. Bump stocks aren't the problem, unconstitutional thinking progressives are!
367 2019-02-08 20:24:47 $COTE - I'm not saying don't buy it. I'm saying only do so if you like stocks that take HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of shares to trade in order to gain ONE TICK!

Also BEWARE of the people trading that one. They were in control of $EGOC as well and we all know the scam they ran on it!
368 2019-02-08 20:21:33 Before we know it they will be buying stocks too.

5) the same
378 2019-02-08 20:15:16 $grat $mxr 50s are definitely coming. Compare to other gold stocks with ten times the shares like novo went from 40 to $8 in three months and novo had massive debt, this one has money in the bank, 10 times less shares and zero debt with guys running it have major gold discoveries
379 2019-02-08 20:14:43 Did you ever consider that a stock holder might be an American worker.  I am both.  Police, Firefighters, Teachers all have pension plans that buy stocks.  Ever here of Calpers?  In your effort to strip the rich you crush the workers too.
380 2019-02-08 20:14:10 Understood. But most seniors' savings intended to boost NZ Super (not for kids' inheritance!). Bach or stocks are sold to enhance current std of living and CGT would adversely affect that. No possibility of recovery from the $$ loss when you're 70++
381 2019-02-08 20:14:07 Lol of course. They are penny stocks i mentioned them as well as cheap stocks; what im saying is u were talking about doubling the money. Specially with shares. In order to see a good return on investment, u need capital. Otherwise its doing too much for bread crumbs.
382 2019-02-08 20:14:05 I think we should all "not feel like working" and the Fed can set closing price of all stocks and futures and they can use MMT to pay for all our shit.  Id like a G5..
383 2019-02-08 20:13:25 Define exploitation? Fine. 83% of stocks are held by the top 1%, those living paycheck to paycheck now over 60%, 66% of income growth in last several years went to top 1%, 36% of American can’t even contribute to retirement savings,
384 2019-02-08 20:13:24 good for you Great STOCKS!

390 2019-02-08 20:10:02 Nope I like both. Acorns is more of a savings account for me that will compound over time. And stash i use for an investment for stocks.
391 2019-02-08 20:09:43 Take a look at international stocks vs always investing in the U.S. The U.S. market trades at 29x normal earnings. The average for all other countries is 16x. This is widest valuation gap in 40 years. Or if you want to get fancy, short the U.S. and go long international.

393 2019-02-08 20:09:03 It is worth noting that in Florida they didn't just ban bump stocks, they banned any modifications that *could* increase rate of fire, like trigger modifications as well.

398 2019-02-08 20:04:27 But, like I said, PEOPLE own corporations.  So, laws that benefit corporations benefit the PEOPLE that own those corporations.  The corporation is not going out to order cheesecake with the money it makes. I am no oligarch, but I sure like it when the stocks I own go up in value.
399 2019-02-08 20:03:53 This year, instead of impulse purchases, i'll just be buying stocks so I (hopefully) don't go broke

405 2019-02-08 20:01:38 Canopy’s earnings are non reflective on Aphria.  This is the exact thinking that’s hurting good stocks or undervalued ones instead of trading them to proper values while over buying others into extreme bubbles like TLRY was and like CRON is now.

420 2019-02-08 19:54:16 Have you considered getting into stocks outside of stash? As far as I know it only gives you a small share. Maybe it's less volatile though.
421 2019-02-08 19:54:09 That's only one part of the equation, as Stocks are not a Zero Sum game.

428 2019-02-08 19:51:09 I just told you. they are paying for the ownership, so they are doing SOMETHING. No one is getting anything for free. This is how "democrat socialist" should work and think. As for buying stocks only the wealthy ie the 1% have the money to corner the market. NO! NO!
429 2019-02-08 19:51:05 What if we let the icies wobble, but they have to drop 2 stocks afterward

453 2019-02-08 19:38:57 when buying stocks for value, I like the spaghetti against the wall approach - buy a bunch of tickers, knowing that some will peel off (not ready) and can be sold for a small loss, while the ones that stick can be held onto...

$AAPL & $FB prove this

461 2019-02-08 19:35:01 People can have ownership now.  It's call buying stocks.  Way more than 1% own stock shares.  You just want someone to hand you ownership for doing nothing.  No financial risk to you at all.
462 2019-02-08 19:34:29 I'm curious, did you read my report recap to know what my math shows for possible bean carryout? Do you know where the numbers on chart come from? If your second guess is USDA, you would be correct. USDA tends to drop its U.S. bean ending stocks guess by 41%. 
Any other bets?

467 2019-02-08 19:31:22 QE had nothing to do with budget proposals. The Fed printed money to "save" the economy, they gave it to banks to lend out. Instead of lending it to Main St, the banks bought stocks to prop up the stock market and gave themselves massive bonuses. quite interesting

470 2019-02-08 19:29:25 Earlier this was floated out on CNBC and stocks immediately turned around.
471 2019-02-08 19:29:16 I hear ya, so yeah, that is often the case, trading too large a position takes your focus off the trade itself and directs it to your P&L. I agree with the other guys too in that over time planned losses are simply part of the journey.
472 2019-02-08 19:28:22 For example, if I have $2M in NW mostly in stocks/bonds, and am trying to get a $500k mtg, that would be FIRE. I would just sell off chunks of my investments each year. 

I don't need a mortgage, but interest rate of mtg<mkt yield in the long run, so I'd want a mtg.
473 2019-02-08 19:26:34 If this rumor of US/China talks back on which is pushing stocks well off their intraday lows proves to be fake again, frankly its an embarrassment for the President...

477 2019-02-08 19:24:26 Seeing #wellsfargooutage trending makes me glad that I put my money in a local credit union, where there are no fees, select branches are open on Saturday, and my money is used to invest in the community, not stocks on Wall Street.
478 2019-02-08 19:23:42 A) That’s a lie. Dividends were up 36% for financial institutions, largely because of the tax cuts. Anyone who owns bank stocks.
B) Explain to me how rich people didn’t work for it. They went to school, they worked hard, they sacrificed, now they make more money.

492 2019-02-08 19:18:07 She forgot to include that Congress is immune to being charged with insider trading... they're allowed to use their position and buy/sell stocks based on privileged knowledge they have access to because they are the government.

494 2019-02-08 19:16:40 It seems that there is a rumor, most likely more fake news to prop up stocks, that US/China trade talks may be back on. Hence the impressive rebound in stocks today. Is this real? I honestly doubt it... #100%FAKENEWS

496 2019-02-08 19:14:31 Yeah,I am still learning that.  Hard to buy and hold these high flying fast moving growth stocks for me vs. older dividend stocks. Would like to do it at the beginning of a market cycle, not near a possible end. Hopefully I will get a chance one day.

507 2019-02-08 19:06:20 Let’s take her “logic” to the rational conclusion.  Because politicians can buy stocks and corporations can donate money,   and their decisions may affect those corps, everything is flawed.  Every politician, ever, makes decisions that influence themselves Starting local on up.
508 2019-02-08 19:05:37 Similar to gold. Some people want it just in case currencies or governments collapse, and they buy physical gold and make sure they have access. If they just want it for speculation, they buy ETFs futures or even buy gold company stocks

513 2019-02-08 19:00:17 And it's bringing their stocks up which means EA will say sp games are dead and mp games are profitable

515 2019-02-08 18:59:34 I think you should be drug from the People's House and be placed in stocks.

517 2019-02-08 18:59:03 The #Mafia long has engaged in securities fraud including #Gambino role in a pump-and-dump scheme with over-the-counter stocks during the late 1950s. A Feb '65 #FBI report recounts "the case involving Carmine Lombardozzi, Arthur Tortorello; et al, from 1956 through 1959."
518 2019-02-08 18:58:07 Summary of today's USDA report:
Friendly Soybeans - Large production cut, modest demand reduction, US ending stocks lower than expected, world ending stocks very friendly
519 2019-02-08 18:58:04 Haha what went wrong  I lost  all my savings investing in your stocks can you return me the money. It's a joke that you are asking me what went wrong Why don't Great Ratan Tata come in public and speak to small investors who hav  been robbed  by this utter foolish management

521 2019-02-08 18:57:34 I hear about farms cutting costs due to outlook of soft prices from tariffs and stocks to use. I argue that we need to change our mindset towards the cost of production per bushel. As I see cutting costs in wrong places drives up COP/bu. Focus on Gross Margin
522 2019-02-08 18:57:12 Dead stocks on my feet I’m walking Ancient history
523 2019-02-08 18:57:03 Summary of today's USDA reports:
Negative Wheat - US ending stocks higher than expected, world stocks neutral, winter wheat planted acres friendly
Negative Corn - Stocks higher than expected due to large demand cut, world stocks also negative
524 2019-02-08 18:54:42 I wish I could buy stock into @JeffreeStar’s cosmetic company. If the company went public along with other beauty/lifestyle brands, it would open up his large audience with a young demographic to trading stocks.
525 2019-02-08 18:54:16 It's difficult to say, as each stock is different. I should be clear that in the US, by and large our stocks are managed very effectively. Not all species are targeted equally, and life history plays a role.
526 2019-02-08 18:54:14 The S&P500 is trading like it had a huge night and just wants to be left alone today, to be at 2694.0 (-0.44%). This makes it -0.48% on the week. #oneweekmove #stocks #sp500 #stockmarket

530 2019-02-08 18:52:22 Forget about bias. It is NOT an opinion. It is how investing works. Telsa has created NO VALUE.  Valuation is depended on belief in a future painted by a charlatan who lies all the time.
Investing in stupid bubble stocks like $TSLA colors people's thinking (or the lack there of).
531 2019-02-08 18:52:18 Anyone who trades pot stocks has likely been a bag holder at some point! I hope you're able to trade your way out if!
532 2019-02-08 18:52:16 No, what is silly is that corporations are giving money to candidates to buy their votes. Then those elected officials are able to purchase stocks and manipulate the values to benefit themselves and their political donor. That is silly. And that was her point.
533 2019-02-08 18:52:09 Yes exactly, so the question is are you selecting the RIGHT size for you to manage the trade properly.

537 2019-02-08 18:50:38 How would say increasing DCA contribution by 25% when below 200-day MA compare to leaving and entering market as article suggests?  Or lump sums added to DCA when stocks drop 20%,30%, so on?
538 2019-02-08 18:50:22 One of the most important things I analyze when I buy #stocks, is when a stock become obvious. Right now, that foresight & planning to build positions very early is paying off, as the crowd gets frustrated over failed breakouts, I'm cruising. $nflx $fb $amzn

540 2019-02-08 18:47:30 0,1% de coûts supplémentaires çà représente des millions pour ces marques. De plus, il faut aussi prendre en compte la place que des tailles représentants une faible part de la population peuvent prendre dans les stocks ou dans les rayons.

542 2019-02-08 18:45:53 La competencia entre los bancos puede darse porque stocks de depósitos a plazo subieron más de $ 240.000 millones desde principios de enero. Al tener más depósitos a plazo tenés más necesidad de colocar, ergo más demanda de leliqs.

551 2019-02-08 18:42:12 Sir, I observed double ATR with 15 min open range breakout works well in some of high beta stocks...
552 2019-02-08 18:42:01 I thought I read somewhere they get first crack at certain stocks before the public, basically legal insider trading....on top of the kickbacks from every lobbyist and "friend" looking for favors
553 2019-02-08 18:41:10 Which is more likely to rise from the ashes of recession. Unless one doesn’t think FAANG stocks are sitting upon a volcanic bubble.
554 2019-02-08 18:40:07 Tip 52: If you buy stocks that have fallen sharply, chasing a bounce in the price, do so with utmost care. You will often find they have been weak for a reason.
555 2019-02-08 18:39:04 Close to the end of the world, only a few maxlist stocks green and it sleeted in Austin.   Melted when it hit the ground but still, this is not what is supposed to happen.  
556 2019-02-08 18:38:50 Agree, but I'm fairly certain they would define it as any semi-auto. Especially the "scary" looking ones with black plastic stocks.
557 2019-02-08 18:38:49 You mean go long stocks and short VIX right?
558 2019-02-08 18:38:21 Tired of winning . U.S. stocks fell for the third straight day on Friday, as skepticism over the United States and China reaching a trade deal before a looming deadline added to concerns over slowing global growth.
559 2019-02-08 18:37:56 We at Myntra believe in providing great deals and discounts. But, the discounted price on our range is limited till the stocks last. So do keep an eye on them! Also, we send a notification when the prices are decreased.

570 2019-02-08 18:34:13 White coats are no longer hunted and choosing to post this story with this photo is very irresponsible.

573 2019-02-08 18:33:30 But it’s still legitimate to ask if it’s in good taste. As a society, we definitely relish a good public takedown a little too enthusiastically. We are the crowd laughing at the man in the stocks in the public square, just for kicks. Let’s not pretend it’s any more than that. /5

580 2019-02-08 18:29:25 The Sexton argument is pointless. At the time Ireland were very low on outhalf stocks. 

The O'Brien situation is nowhere near a double standard, a simple comparison of their contracts shows that.

585 2019-02-08 18:25:41 Bleh I hate when the stock market has its worst week of the year the week I buy 3 new stocks. Very rough week for me.
586 2019-02-08 18:24:37 Bump stocks make semi not semi. They make them automatic. Well little men who need to be tough need their little bump stocks. Real men don't need much to feel tough. They just are. So remember real men don't whine, have bump stocks, or hide in their basements. Like Jimjoebob77
587 2019-02-08 18:23:51 No one is trying to take away your right to own a gun, we are just trying to to remove assault rifles, bump stocks, better screening in terms of mental health. What does a disturbed 16 year old need an AR-15 for? Why does anyone need 30guns for? Enough already

597 2019-02-08 18:17:15 You've gone on the attack and insulted people who disagree with you. Rather than discussing things civily. Why is that? I never claimed it should be only weapons I approve of. You jumped to your own conclusion. If it's not about bump stocks what is it about?
598 2019-02-08 18:16:11 That amount of value $TCNNF has to gain is literally immeasurable. Just wait til they become current and the market starts to shift its current valuations of marijuana stocks to $TCNNF. Low float. Only marijuana company with positive EBITDA. it’ll fly. Sky high 
599 2019-02-08 18:15:59 I'm going to wager that we're not really going to see shortages in the event of a No Deal (barring the odd empty supermarket shelf the morning on March 29 as people panic quicker than staff can refill). It's the Y2K effect. Problem so heavily anticipated that stocks probably huge

604 2019-02-08 18:13:15 Exactly with the way it’s set up if you’re not already wealthy and don’t take money from PAC it’s unlikely you can afford to run. I also don’t think it’s fair for public offices to have to get rid of stocks during their service. Maybe a pay cut

610 2019-02-08 18:11:06 You kno what ima still hold on to these Wells Fargo stocks..
611 2019-02-08 18:10:33 Seems like they both prioritized playing time over wins, since they’re both approaching free agency. Should help boost the stocks a bit.
612 2019-02-08 18:08:26 In North America, we get very little news explaining what is going on in Europe, yet, it is very intriguing how poor their banks are doing. Even LeMonde doesn’t say enough. Would love to read a blog analyzing their stocks and doing some explaining. $eufn
613 2019-02-08 18:07:36 Well yeah stocks are high due to the TV deals and Saudi money. Everything else isn't doing that great raitings are down, live events aren't selling, merch looks like it took a hit, etc. Not dying levels but not good to investors if they didn't have the tv and Saudi money
614 2019-02-08 18:06:01 I see my watchlist has $ALXN has golden cross on hour chart.

615 2019-02-08 18:05:39 Real estate + businesses + stocks = wealth 
616 2019-02-08 18:05:36 Karthik, it will not be possible for us to tell that. We do fundamental analysis of stocks. Based on a few parameters such as ROCE, Debt to Equity ratio, forward PE and PEG, we can say that it is a very good company. Q3FY19 PAT was affected due to hedging losses.
617 2019-02-08 18:05:23 There was one thing Trump did that pleasantly surprised me—banned bump stocks. I didn’t *resist because it’s Trump*. If he makes a policy I agree with, I won’t resist for silly reasons. However I do see plenty of that on both sides.
618 2019-02-08 18:04:41 @freetrade so you have added some stocks.  #notnews
619 2019-02-08 18:04:36 Because it was over extended to the downside on the daily chart; so odds of a bounce was high and sometimes stocks can squeeze big on secondary offerings!
620 2019-02-08 18:04:32 I'm thinking about that ramen. I hope it won't be out of stocks tom. I need to find it in foreign stores wanna try it too
621 2019-02-08 18:04:31 Yes. But I think in this instance she’s saying people that have the power to pass legislation about PAC, stocks, etc shouldn’t be allowed to have holdings in those areas. Which makes sense but not sure if it’s constitutional
622 2019-02-08 18:04:28 There was some leaked information about an EA Star Wars game earlier this week - I don't know anything about stocks/the market, but my hunch is that the success is related
623 2019-02-08 18:04:11 Since the Aug. 2018 WASDE report, KC wheat ending stocks have went from 394 million BU. to Feb. 8th report of 491 M Bu., which is equivalent to roughly 2.5 million acres of HRW at trend yields.  IMO, the acreage decline doesn't have as impact on price as if ending st hadn't rose.
624 2019-02-08 18:03:19 the crypto negative correlation is showing lastly with stocks is amazing too. Whales know how cal the attention of investors.
625 2019-02-08 18:03:13 I just really feel like the "Contemporary Colonial" esthetic of bright white walls, wainscoting, and wood floors doesn't work with the St. Andrews Cross, flogging horse, and bed with stocks...
626 2019-02-08 18:03:02 Growth for a capital-heavy metal bender is messy. I don't own any auto stocks because they are generally awful businesses. Making margins while in hyper growth seems problematic.
627 2019-02-08 18:02:24 Definitely living in the future when Aldi stocks bee pollen, wagyu jerky, and jeroboams of prosecco. And people pay with their phones!
628 2019-02-08 18:02:22 At midday, Mortgage Bond prices slightly higher. Stocks lower on global growth concerns, though off worst levels. 10-yr yield 2.62%.

Snapchat is still going crazy. Up another 5% today and up 42.6% over the last month. 

Ford is way down right now so buying in wouldn’t be bad. They just hired a lot of workforce to increase SUV production; investing 1 billion to overhaul.

651 2019-02-08 17:53:50 Very often 'someone knows something' and the run in stocks typically occurs long before the news is made public. "Buy the rumor, sell the news". Now that Wall Street is already in crypto, would not be surprised to see the same thing happen. Just FYI 30+ years trading.

Why are you opposed to progress? Do you own oil stocks?

661 2019-02-08 17:49:27 Yesterday howard schultz past CEO of Starbucks stated he believed he and others shld pay a higher rate of tax. More nonsense: if that's the case tax his savings, investments at 90%. 
He doesn't tell u, ppl like him take low salaries, get paid with stocks at a lower tax rate!
662 2019-02-08 17:48:49 Dan - while this may apply to US politics, the rules in Canada are much different as you should well know. Cabinet ministers cannot hold any stocks and election spending rules are very transparent and much stricter than in the US.

667 2019-02-08 17:46:41 Yes, I think that whole thing may have been a misunderstanding. Unless I missed something, China said they had sold 100 mmt last year from reserves. I don't necessarily think that meant a revision in stocks (which already happened late in the year).
668 2019-02-08 17:45:40 People keep asking me how we pay for #GreenNewDeal. It is an investment just like buying stocks or an LED light bulb. We commit to the up-front costs bc we know we make money down the road. Capitalism at its best! And we end up with more jobs, clean air & water. Great Deal!
669 2019-02-08 17:44:37 Daniel - so sorry I missed your question. Let me give this some thought, although the kind of societal collapse Jem is suggesting has grave implications for all stocks (not just fossil fuel companies) if not other asset valuations (e.g. housing etc).
670 2019-02-08 17:44:26 CANN is probably one of the few weed stocks out there that I wouldn't dream of Shorting! They are working on becoming one of the largest extractors in the entire country and all for a paltry $120 or $130m market cap? I think they will easily hit $500m market cap this year.

677 2019-02-08 17:40:59 Stocks are in Negative Territory, as Investors begin to look toward US/China Trade Talks.  Concerns about meeting March 1st deadline continue to grow, as reports state they're still far apart on Agreement.  MBS is now up 9bps, Mtg Rates unchanged.  Yields are at 2.64%.
678 2019-02-08 17:40:52 Investors have nothing to do with it though. Stocks almost always drop after Directs no matter what because those investors don't even know anything about the industry and don't know what they actually want. It isn't hurting Nintendo in the slightest.

689 2019-02-08 17:36:28 Good point -- especially in these smaller stocks.  On a fairly regular basis I've seen small order(s) for a few hundred dollars knock the price down near the close making the days trading appear worse. Happened to Goviex $GXU yesterday as an example: $140 order!
690 2019-02-08 17:35:24 Ok. What should one look out for in the search for fundamentally sound but undervalued stocks?

692 2019-02-08 17:34:43 Stock market is down. many amazing buys out there managers are rotating into div stocks & avoiding high beta names.  Wouldn’t surprise me if we retest lows if jobs/consumer/trade get weak... seems prudent to be defensive or collar/hedge high beta names

700 2019-02-08 17:30:00 U.S. stocks fell for a third day, helping drag global equities toward their first weekly decline of the year as concern over economic growth and trade disputes halted the torrid post-Christmas rally. Treasuries climbed. - Bloomberg
701 2019-02-08 17:29:54 it hasnt gone up also,  distribution being done in a range and you are confusing and being bullish, look at the breadth,  look at AD ,  look at cash stocks,  ten stocks rotating in a range,  lately just one doesnt make the market bullish, so many stocks collapsed, money for the

Elector threats (2016) go unprosecuted
Law & Order is non existent
Conservatives are targeted daily by most corrupt agency on the planet
Media & ISP's controlled by Socialists

But hey, stocks are up.
710 2019-02-08 17:25:46 anything is possible and allowed but looking at the state of the market,  breadth etc.  looks unlikely that a handful of stocks have energy left to lift the market
711 2019-02-08 17:25:27 If you have the power to increase stocks in any industry and of any corporation you want, then why the heck are you not increasing the stocks as much as you can? With your power, the stock market should be up +1000 every day!!
712 2019-02-08 17:25:20 $CIX.TO do stocks move on earnings because something in them show a change in long term cash flows? CI is at 7x FCF, yet drops big on results that I would think suggests or confirms present value of cash flows are much higher than $17.50/share.
713 2019-02-08 17:25:11 Low volume sell-off. Barring completely heinous economic data, material sellers exited in Q4. No firepower on downside. The tandem move of stocks lower and yields lower makes equities that much more attractive versus where they started the week.
714 2019-02-08 17:25:11 London stocks dipped at the end of the week, unable to make any headway amid fresh concerns about trade relations between the US and China and extending the heavy losses sustained during the previous session.

722 2019-02-08 17:23:15 This pause by Powell is not bullish for stocks, imo, as we just saw with the post NFP bull trap. It's not QE or any such good news, rate cut could be the next move in a few months.
723 2019-02-08 17:23:09 Have of the working people in our country do not have $500 in the bank. CEOs get paid millions for what? Meetings, Golfing and Manipulating their Stocks.

882 2019-02-08 16:37:52 Crypto up, stocks down, what a great day
883 2019-02-08 16:37:22 When markets weaken, trader/investors look to the utilities like $EIX and $PCG as well as the the considered "safe" stocks like $CLX $DPZ and $DNKN (we use these last 3, no matter whats going on in the economy at large)

889 2019-02-08 16:34:44 Someone who has a style for investing, understands value and don't buy stocks which are on momentum, don't charge high expense ratio, high integrity and accepts mistake, deep understanding of sector where they invest just like @oraunak @RajeevThakkar @PPFAS

891 2019-02-08 16:34:04 Is the growth solution to growing number of problems we are facing? Don't think so. I hope that with this tweet you ment just what will happen to stocks. One thing I don't see you ever talk is ethical investing, just as alternative, if not your mainstream thought, to broaden...
892 2019-02-08 16:33:59 If you tracked all stocks that have been bought back you can still see a pattern
893 2019-02-08 16:33:56 True that. Momentum is a bonafide factor. But one becomes the victim of one’s own image. And to continue with that u have to ‘style drift’ but can’t admit. Which is why the point I was making the other day. Harder to pick funds than stocks if you really do in-depth analysis
894 2019-02-08 16:32:35 Timothy Sykes is the most well known trader there is, our strategies may vary but i agree with him Penny Stocks is where its at that's where the ROI is, I trade OTC primarily because of the gains & Risking less capital to make the same amount of profits and repeating the process.

933 2019-02-08 16:17:49 Stocks (or any other asset) increasing in value isn't money creation. When you sell the stock, money is transferred to you from somewhere else in the economy. Bank lending is private sector debt. Helicopter money is still pub sect debt. All dollars are both assets & liabilities.

945 2019-02-08 16:14:18 Earnings are income before extra items. It uses diluted shares when they are available (most aren't before the late 90s). We've tested both, and it doesn't make a big different for broad market indicators like this. I'm sure there are cases when it matters for individual stocks.
946 2019-02-08 16:14:15 I think “hit chasing” the video game stocks is about as dumb as doing it in the movie industry.  Hits come and leave just as quickly.  Franchises are great but it’s a volume/luck game as much as anything.

950 2019-02-08 16:13:03 This is a hard one to answer, a few things to consider. RSI has demonstrated in Jan on so many pot stocks to go well over 80 before a pullback-we've broken that major resistance at $0.80 on strong volume. I would say consolidation is more likely between $0.75 and $0.80.Your take?

1012 2019-02-08 15:50:35 I get the sense that the idea is that it's going to be pitched as some incremental "abolish ICE" move. And, I think that you're right, simply limiting bed stocks isn't necessarily going to deal with the detention question.

1234 2019-02-09 23:31:54 There's a difference between the best-performing stocks and the best growth stocks. All you have to do is look at the best-performing stocks year to date, or in the last 6-months, 1-year, etc.
1235 2019-02-09 23:29:37 Except they don’t reinvest in those things. Instead they buy stocks in other companies, and leave the worker hanging. Trusting companies is a dangerous, dangerous mistake that Americans should know better than.

1263 2019-02-09 22:49:23 It’s 100% rational though. With rates as low as they are, getting leverage and buying back stocks is the best option for many companies.

1268 2019-02-09 22:46:34 Now why does that surprise you ? She’s such a clever girl, probably secretly trading stocks and bonds...
1269 2019-02-09 22:46:30 This is worth an @ if you can find that guy haha. I wish I knew business/stocks when I was in my late teens and into the beginning of college. Would have easily known the companies to invest in (EA/Activision Blizzard).
1270 2019-02-09 22:46:11 Ya know what talent the moochers I seen have. The ability to write a algorythym that drains ppls investments on a daily basis even when stocks drop. Billionaires. Ya might of seen a few on tv or the news. Scaramoochi was one. Everyone I know works. But laziness is taught.
1271 2019-02-09 22:45:51 I just took 13 stocks in a crew battle
1272 2019-02-09 22:45:50 @arcadiain key here we have to wait and see I seen it happen to 9 different stocks just like this after it drops under the 20 MA
1273 2019-02-09 22:44:26 Ima reup on loud I ain’t buying no stocks
1274 2019-02-09 22:44:17 Clarification: Unemployment has continued along the same trend as it has been for the better part of a decade. Stocks were also continuing a familiar trend before your moronic trade wars stifled all progress last year. We are only 400 points up from this time last year.
1275 2019-02-09 22:43:50 First stock rise of boil ease 2019 has begun make sure you invest lots of hurt butts.stocks where down untill now @PlayApex
1276 2019-02-09 22:43:13 It seems executives buy back stocks at peaks (2007) and slow them at troughs (2009), instead of the opposite. Had executives not bought back so much stock in 2007, for example, buying more in 2009 instead, they could have generated even more value for today's shareholders. 1/
1277 2019-02-09 22:43:07 @AskRobinhood @RobinhoodApp 

Any chance you'll remove the $500 limit on the free stocks? I've only been on the platform a month but nearly reached it. I heard @WebullGlobal doesn't have a limit. I don't want to switch platforms. Thanks.
1278 2019-02-09 22:42:54 I don't think anyone worships the president, he's clearly fallible. He's made bad calls (e.g. on bump stocks, and not focusing on the wall soon enough).

You're just punching a really elaborate strawman.

Say, what faith are you?
1279 2019-02-09 22:42:23 Literally I had two stocks at 0% he had one at 0% and I blew it
1280 2019-02-09 22:42:00 Oh nice the official Nintendo Qualifiers is played with stocks on I thought it was just 7 minute time.
1281 2019-02-09 22:41:29 I’ll also add, anyone earning over 200k likely owns stocks, and every sector outside health insurers will see a huge expense come off their books which will be a boost to their stock price
1282 2019-02-09 22:40:57 To be fair, I don't see how relevant the sexuality of a video game character is for the game (unless the game has mechanics involving relationships [Dragon Age] or has huge lore [OverWatch]) so EA saying that some of those characters are part of the LGBT+, is just to gain stocks.

1286 2019-02-09 22:38:53 Pick up a few defense stocks, if you haven't already. Besides being long in $BA $NOC and $LMT, I've increased my positions in $KTOS and $HEI
1287 2019-02-09 22:37:36 Cc .@RyansUnfiltered 
Were this hypothesis ever to be confirmed, it would be the end of these social media platforms, at least as we know them today.   The fines alone under GDPR for covering up a data beach of this magnitude would be crippling, even before the impact on stocks.
1288 2019-02-09 22:37:02 I went 3 matches in a fucking row today that was 3 stocks and 3 minutes with items and Smash Ball!! Even tho I won all of em I was still pissed.
1289 2019-02-09 22:35:43 campaigns can be completely funded by PACs- no requirement for grass roots or matching funds, no restriction on whether they then promote a bill or vote on a bill related to PAC or stocks they may own. all of AOC  money came from grass roots, they r going to tear her down
1290 2019-02-09 22:33:54 you ever just watch someone melt two stocks because final smash and then assembling Dragoon right away
1291 2019-02-09 22:32:59 Maybe you know this, maybe you don't.  Predators are all over TV with ads about buying and selling stocks.  No reputable adviser recommends buying and selling the wise thing-buy and hold, no broker needed to skim your profits
1292 2019-02-09 22:32:42 Gold amaka but then Investment houses need to start marketing stocks, mutuals funds bonds etc as Valentine gifts. Would be nice for property developers to do same. 

No pressure. Just saying.
1293 2019-02-09 22:32:22 I think the speed at which he contests and wins stocks vs Absa matters tho. Absa edgeguards you ok but you also get to kill with combust at like 60..
1294 2019-02-09 22:32:05 The MRHA doesn't regulate drug stocks or borders. It's gaslighting by Esther McVey.
1295 2019-02-09 22:32:02 This CFO specifically did actually. He left in 2017 and is returning. The millions in stocks are an attempt to try and keep him this time.
1296 2019-02-09 22:29:15 I beg to differ with regard to the new retirement accounts. They are still link to a market—stocks,  bonds, etc. I am self employed and am still waiting for the market to come back from the October “correction.”  I not only lost some of what I had, but also all I put in.
1297 2019-02-09 22:28:01 Thank you for replying. Could your buying team tell me which store stocks rooibos tea? I've visited a few more without success.
1298 2019-02-09 22:23:49 I hope people are buying thier #UKOG shares in a “stocks and share ISA.”

That way, if they go up are we believe they should you won’t get a hefty CGT bill when you sell them!
1299 2019-02-09 22:23:48 People interested in gold is microscopic compared to stocks.  You probably just spend more time around that group
1300 2019-02-09 22:23:06 I must be REALLY lucky then. I played about 50 matches and i always got 3 stocks and FD or Battlefield forms. And the timer was always between 5 or 7 minutes.
1301 2019-02-09 22:22:25 I want to get into stocks ....
1302 2019-02-09 22:21:04 jpense pouvoir aisément dire que j'ai perdu une centaine de stocks à cause du fait qu'on peut pas drop des plateformes
1303 2019-02-09 22:20:13 “Borrowed stocks”. I don’t follow...
1304 2019-02-09 22:19:56 Worth noting the third also exists in Penny Stocks/OTC Markets.
1305 2019-02-09 22:19:39 Ban and put him in the stocks so people can lob shit at him
1306 2019-02-09 22:18:20 Don't play the penny stocks.
1307 2019-02-09 22:18:01 No bid stocks are common I agree and depending on the convertible notes and share structure it is risky

1310 2019-02-09 22:16:12 @mrjamesob As Grayling Titanic sinks, SuperShips stocks soar.
1311 2019-02-09 22:15:48 Yes. I really am a civillian. I have no bots running scripts to watch you. I have no company or stocks 

I currently have £50 pounds to my name 

You attacked me as if i was a gov or a company when really i'm an autistic person with no friends and no life beyond liking sherlock
1312 2019-02-09 22:15:47 To be fair, I use it all the time when I'm playing dice games, and it works great. I understand that might not be considered "the real world," but I play Settlers of Catan a whole lot more than I trade stocks.
1313 2019-02-09 22:15:04 Pull out most stocks and most investments the mad hatter is out here really lost his head and we might not get any taxes Purge might start lol why am I thinking like this
1314 2019-02-09 22:14:49 this stocks is spicy
1315 2019-02-09 22:14:19 Goddess is really good.
Fuhler bra on instagram stocks their products. It’s called a basque. Got one for 25k
1316 2019-02-09 22:14:00 Ecological instability includes disruption of pollinator populations, possibly their collapse, mass failures of cereal crops. Ocean acidification can destroy fish stocks. There’ll be all kinds of new disease vectors. If migration reaches a certain level, borders bristle with guns
1317 2019-02-09 22:13:18 I think sometimes the daily analysts for Fanduel lineups just needs to get to the point and tell us which players will have the most steals and blocks. 
#fanduel #dfs #DailySports #nba #fantasybasketball #fantasynba #lineups #stocks
1318 2019-02-09 22:12:38 so you mean stocks like funding secured are short term and missed revenues and guidance are long term
1319 2019-02-09 22:11:47 Definitely. My stocks are getting low. I imagine everyone else is facing the same dilemma. 
1320 2019-02-09 22:11:30 I'm telling you. Download the Robinhood app and just deposit 3 bucks into it and pick some cheap stocks. It's literally so much fun.
1321 2019-02-09 22:10:16 Eugene, you'd be happy further pumping stocks piles
1322 2019-02-09 22:09:19 @Nigel_Farage @BorisJohnson @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Jingoist, xenophobic, Leave leaders lied & overspent in the campaign, influencing less well-informed & elderly voters. It's those Leaders whose garments we should rend & then pillory them naked in the stocks in punishment for brexit.
1323 2019-02-09 22:09:06 So I'm now an investor....nothing crazy but let me tell you I've only put a total of 15 bucks in a combined 4 stocks and I'm addicted to it. It's cheap fun. Made 5 cents today and never have been so hyped to make that lmao.
1324 2019-02-09 22:07:25 #LCS Stocks: 4x TL = 2,668, 3x CLG = 1,437, 1x GGS = 379, 1x TSM = 504. Total = 4,988 spent
1325 2019-02-09 22:06:53 Who has been looking at the Banking stocks. The way GTBank and Zenith grew last week is amazing. If Zenith can cross #35 I'd probably sell

Have y'all seen the result.

1329 2019-02-09 22:02:46 Common Bernie, you know they leveraged three fold to buy back stocks. 15% of s&p 500 cannot even service their interest payments. Cause, zero percent interest rates for too long, the FED mistep!
1330 2019-02-09 22:02:41 For some reason, it seems like every Roy I've played against use 3 stocks, 3 minutes

1331 2019-02-09 22:00:49 Can someone teach me how to invest in stocks ?
1332 2019-02-09 21:59:33 Okay... Meristem doesn't do foreign stocks but a company called TD AMERITRADE does, you can check them out online.

1334 2019-02-09 21:58:13 Lol. Too late they are already buying gold and other precious metals/stones and selling stocks short. It’s the biggest con ever. They get to avoid the new “EU Tax Avoidance” Laws whilst making money on a falling currency and market. It’s the easiest way to make money on stocks.
1335 2019-02-09 21:56:41 Well what does neo liberalism mean?

I can only think it applies to austerity.

Most ppl talk about neoliberalism when talking about the Clinton era when they started to privatize government sectors. This took away government backed pensions in favor for stocks and so on
1336 2019-02-09 21:56:20 2 stocks for 2 bombs
1337 2019-02-09 21:54:57 I'm so envious you live near some place that actually stocks weeb fodder.
1338 2019-02-09 21:54:52 That's where they'd be wrong.  It shows the cluelessness so many have about Democrat voters.  We own guns.  We hunt.  We have a concealed permit.  But we want better background checks, the elimination of bump stocks, etc.
1339 2019-02-09 21:52:57 Not being able to watch @KimsConvenience in the United States is killing me!  @netflix I'm a subscriber and a share holder!  I better see some #KimsConvenience soon or I'm cancelling my subscription and selling my stocks!  #NotKidding
1340 2019-02-09 21:52:35 My stocks been trash lately...I hope to see to a rise by summer
1341 2019-02-09 21:51:21 Hey @DoctorLex, how similar is that what @InPayTo is doing to what Abra had done? (I mean stocks)
1342 2019-02-09 21:50:01 i get more options and variety, I can choose used it pick a store with a different price and shipping cost, and usually get it in 2 days.  I never had to leave my house, fight traffic and find parking only to find the store is out, never stocks it or is expensive.  2/2
1343 2019-02-09 21:47:51 Even if you blindly believed your taxes would be the same at first, once businesses didnt give the money to employees and instead did buy back of stocks to benefit themselves and shareholders...that would ve been the sign of oh shit
1344 2019-02-09 21:47:44 MFs are for illiterates! Any educated person should directly buy stocks (start with top 10 cos by MCap). U will fair better than most of the MFs! 
1345 2019-02-09 21:47:42 Outside of the colors, the looting is more Blackout like. Spray patterns aren't too crazy but attachments like stocks and barrel stabilizers make it a lot better.

It's free, hop in a give it a whirl!
1346 2019-02-09 21:46:59 Guy has 3 gfs, wants to decide which one to marry. Gives each $10K.

One buys stocks and triples her $. 2nd gets new outfits and manicure to look pretty. 3rd gives $ back, thinking he'd really appreciate it.

Which on did he marry?

The one with big boobs.
1347 2019-02-09 21:44:10 Perhaps you should investigate find out who holds stocks and how they voted. It would be interesting
1348 2019-02-09 21:44:00 You can still chromicide like normal if I’m Chrom at 2 stocks high% and you’re at 1 stock 0% it still works. Just a situational part of it is gone which doesn’t really mean much.
1349 2019-02-09 21:43:40 This dungeon bucks the stigma of the typical dark, gloominess associated with most dungeons.

1350 2019-02-09 21:43:29 The time is long overdue to get average Americans financially literate and buying more stocks.
1351 2019-02-09 21:41:29 It would be nice to know what stocks their products are in, so we will know to invest, and reap our rewards as well.

1353 2019-02-09 21:39:35 Your point is exactly right. Everyone freaks out about the price going down after gene therapy had a rough couple days. This stocks always been shorted and it’s no different-the insider selling is planned and not due to bad data. I believe in DI and what the company is doing.
1354 2019-02-09 21:39:05 @Commish_Stocks Ahem....
1355 2019-02-09 21:38:59 No items. FD. 4 stocks.
1356 2019-02-09 21:38:33 They are both stocks ones actually not cash ones. Not sure why I called them that
1357 2019-02-09 21:36:27 Fair enough.

But Numerology wasn't created with sports or stocks in mind either, but still works.
1358 2019-02-09 21:35:47 I’m banking on majority of Americans having lots more common sense than the supporters of AOC & the Dims

Overhead interstate trains?! Lol I won’t be selling my airline stocks anytime soon.

Your free ride will be over if Dims win in 2020. Either way Trump will get the last 
1359 2019-02-09 21:35:40 Be unable to stop them. All pensions, stocks, etc will be co-opted to pay for all these items but instead of making the poor richer, it will cause mass migration of anyone with money away from here, further increasing burden on those left, no U.N. to save us, Canada will build
1360 2019-02-09 21:34:08 Why two cash returns are so crap. Not fancying a stocks and shares one?
1361 2019-02-09 21:34:02 Wind: Norway, France, Germany, China, Canada, UK, Spain

Solar: Norway, China, Japan, Germany

There's too much reliance on stocks & what the shareholders have to say in the US. Eliminate the stock market & start your MAGA. Then ya can move forward and stop destroying the earth
1362 2019-02-09 21:32:48 forex or stocks?

1364 2019-02-09 21:30:35 When you are looking to invest in foreign markets from Nigeria, America is not your only option. In fact in 2018 it could be said that US markets offered poor return on risk. 

Unlike Emerging Markets stocks  (China, Brazil, Russia, etc)
1365 2019-02-09 21:28:54 Queue up the tomatoes to throw at me...

Crypto stocks might be back in play $OSTK $RIOT $GBTC
1366 2019-02-09 21:28:25 Keep your GD hands off our guns, Gun accessories and gun parts. Back away from our ammo as well. Don't ban bump stocks,  it leads to another "bad" part and another. 

The2nd amendment was to protect us from foreign AND DOMESTIC.  In other words,  our own government.
1367 2019-02-09 21:27:07 Also, common real world application matters. 

99% of people don't know a thing about metaphysics.

But everyone knows about stocks, sports, and poltics.
1368 2019-02-09 21:25:19 The penny stocks market.
1369 2019-02-09 21:19:58 The pattern for cann stocks in 2018:
mon/tuesday pump (rise in price)
Wed Dump (selloff)
Thurs/friday trade sideways 

Earnings do not mean much right now

Too many short sellers trying to manipulate prices.

One bad report affects all stocks.  

Buy and hold long term wins.
1370 2019-02-09 21:18:59 35 millions out of the 40 millions were stocks.
1371 2019-02-09 21:13:48 A huge part of the $15 million are stocks. Reading the article should be considered.
1372 2019-02-09 21:13:06 I saw 1.75 million and I'm like eh not too ba- 20 MILLION IN STOCKS

1374 2019-02-09 21:09:28 Good work on the stocks of white wine. Am a bit far from the Palladium but would happily have been another #tokenmale if I weren’t; am loving the book, which, mutatis mutandis, has some echoes of my own student life. Never been to Leamington Spa, though, by taxi or otherwise.

1376 2019-02-09 21:08:02 So were Norway being opportunistic, selfish, and immoral when, in 1990, they set up what is now the biggest Sovereign Wealth Fund in the world (the Government Wealth Fund Global), which recently topped $1.1 trillion (~$200k per head) and owns 1.3% of all global stocks and shares?
1377 2019-02-09 21:06:34 Musta been stocks
1378 2019-02-09 21:05:12 The way I see it currently, taxing rich people 70% income tax doesn't make sense. Don't people realize most of their wealth is tied up in stocks and real estate and therefore it's not income that they're getting? It's just an estimate of their networth.
1379 2019-02-09 21:04:49 Obama told you about the American surah I had a non disclosure you've been manipulating stocks and killing people. You thought Kim Jong un wouldn't know. The stock market won't crash with out you. The clear party is better. Is nothing clear you are not native American. Love rosy
1380 2019-02-09 21:04:32 Same way stocks work. You have to buy through a brokerage. They charge a fee. 

Want to buy a house?  Find a realtor. Pay a fee.
1381 2019-02-09 21:03:17 Should have used that money to buy pot stocks
1382 2019-02-09 21:03:09 Except, nobody asked y’all to arbitrarily decide for me three accounts. @ewarren is literally describing what banks are doing to try & get investors to buy more stocks. Or did you not bother watching the entire video? I suspect we’ll be hearing PNC fraud scandals in a few years
1383 2019-02-09 21:02:26 Real stocks.
1384 2019-02-09 20:56:43 That’s the first thing I thought of when Trump banned and confiscated bump stocks from 400,000 responsible law abiding citizens who had done nothing wrong!
1385 2019-02-09 20:52:56 Classic whataboutism. The topic she's speaking about is brazen corruption that is legal. Do you think she's wrong about legislators owning stocks in the industries they regulate? Do you think she's wrong about corporate PACs fully funding campaigns? Do you find that acceptable?
1386 2019-02-09 20:52:39 No, fishing is in decline across the EU. Everyone has overfished and fish stocks are a challenging issue. There will always be disputed waters and neogtiated will always be needed. We are also accessing what will be EU only waters.
1387 2019-02-09 20:50:54 @berner415 where do I buy your stocks
1388 2019-02-09 20:50:10 Used 1 year as that is how income is taxed. The S&P return was negative last year, though I agree that stocks typically rise over the intermediate and long terms.
1389 2019-02-09 20:49:56 Don’t drink and drive.  Ban bump stocks and assault riffles.
1390 2019-02-09 20:49:56 LMFAO as if sports and stocks are the defining subjects of humanity. This guy 
1391 2019-02-09 20:48:31 Do you realize that a huge portion of the American people don’t own stocks? Do you also realize the stock market is not the economy? I fear you are ignorant of most Americans situations. Expected from a maga. Y’all have zero understanding of American values. Hint: it’s not money.
1392 2019-02-09 20:48:06 $GDAR with all the .0001 stocks running lately, GDAR will join soon. 3.3 billion shares outstanding. 380 mill on the ask at .0001. Put on your watchlist,  this one is going to run very soon. Several group chats have been talking about loading this one
1393 2019-02-09 20:48:04 @KimStrassel during the 35 day govt. shutdown stocks went way up ......
1394 2019-02-09 20:46:32 this is why i love bear markets. no one wants to buy stocks like this at lows,12-13,but now, people will get long a company that makes no money in a world where economies are deteriorating. bear mkts cause sucker purchases at ridiculous prices, feel,good with small rally, then 
1395 2019-02-09 20:46:26 Trolls generally don’t bash shitty/dead stocks and FUD rarely spreads. All the chatter means the shorts are panicking to cover and we got a runner on our hands.
1396 2019-02-09 20:45:30 In the end everything is interconnected so many substances have some impact on dopamin, noradrenalin, serotonin, maybe even the GABA system etc. But by itself cannabis is not serotonergic and certainly doesn't deplete serotonin stocks.
1397 2019-02-09 20:45:18 These financial bankers will tell you that the best future investment to make is with Stocks and bonds.But the best investment you can make to secure you for the future is to follow Jesus Christ. You can’t take all that money to the grave, your money will perish with you!Acts8:20
1398 2019-02-09 20:45:12 Stocks go up and down short-term all the time, but they don't go up in the medium or long-term when earnings are not growing. FYI......not only are earnings not growing anymore, THEY ARE FALLING.
1399 2019-02-09 20:44:01 Spending my Saturday picking out the best retirement investment options. Stocks and Bonds and Indexes oh my! Thankfully @Fidelity makes it easy  #adulting #AdultingAndStuff #investments

1401 2019-02-09 20:42:44 Very low quality stocks firing up ..$ostk $tlry $cgc ..but none of my pet bioturds.. theres a stock that even  fixes co2 straight from air to the plants ..
1402 2019-02-09 20:42:13 Pour finir les stocks, sans doute !!!
1403 2019-02-09 20:40:42 Stocks dipped about 12% or something like that - don't think so
1404 2019-02-09 20:39:34  seeing as Nat has eaten all our ice cream I’m going to have mine plain, so same time next week will give Nat time to replenish the ice cream stocks

1407 2019-02-09 20:36:08 That happens here in the frozen north, too. I live in a small town, and we are densely packed. But everyone stocks up like we won't see civilization in weeks. And we all have plows....
1408 2019-02-09 20:36:07 Anyone got any good material out there to read about penny stocks or playing the market? #pennystocks #robinhood #ilovemoney
1409 2019-02-09 20:35:49 Yup, and with assistance of the NRA, Trump banned and confiscated bump stocks from 400,000 law abiding citizens. Perhaps if we want to protect our 2A, the alleged 2-A organization will stop calling for the erosion of our rights and instead fight all attacks on it. Slippery slope!
1410 2019-02-09 20:35:47 Fair point, stocks would be about appropriate.
1411 2019-02-09 20:35:30 Tyrone is a kitsune who trades stocks for a living.
1412 2019-02-09 20:35:17 I bet he’d lie on his kids to save his own ass. That’s what we got running our country. Bravo we are now the laughing stocks of the world. Thanks Trump
1413 2019-02-09 20:34:44 "...the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 left dividend tax rates unchanged - ... at the same rates as regular income in the US, providing a powerful incentive for investors to ...favor the low-to-no dividend paying stocks over those that paid out more significant dividends."
1414 2019-02-09 20:32:35 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1415 2019-02-09 20:32:24 Yeah, I will watch it close. Personally when I get to that point I would rather hawk real estate than fuck with stocks or anything else. Or gambling, of course.
1416 2019-02-09 20:32:05 A lot of bank money comes from their professional traders trading forex, stocks etc
1417 2019-02-09 20:28:06 No. The letters are stocks from a pack by @AleksGraphicFR
1418 2019-02-09 20:28:01 Len, you know that the NRA is raging mad right now because bump stocks were banned, right?
Surely, you realize that the NRA did everything possible to try to keep bump stocks from being banned?
Yes? No? No fucking clue?
1419 2019-02-09 20:26:38 Seguramente son autos comprados y pagados hace varios meses. Considerando que aumentaron mas de 30/40% en los últimos seis meses, están vendiendo al costo histórico sin poder reponer stocks. No hay secretos en las concesionarias. Margen máximo es 15% sobre costo fábrica
1420 2019-02-09 20:24:59 So they spend 3.75 mil in cash and give the guy a bunch of stocks. Because they desperately need that roll filled. And I get it, but they are in trouble because they have lost the trust of their largest demographic because they moved to mobile to push the microtrastaction model.
1421 2019-02-09 20:23:44 Personally, I don't know what to think about this whole vaccination issue. The amount of vaccinations has gotten completely out of hand. The pharma companies & those who own heavy stocks through them are making an absolute killing. Are they duping the public to fill their pockets
1422 2019-02-09 20:23:30 Some stocks are. But we are comparing apples to oranges now. Currency and stocks are different entities. Stock is projections, currencies are contingent on defenses and or assets. A dollar will not crash like a stock. A crypto, as we have seen, can half or quarter in days.
1423 2019-02-09 20:23:25 People also suspect that Activision also may have affected the stocks.
1424 2019-02-09 20:22:17 Good job I’ve got stocks of tissues from the sounds of it!
1425 2019-02-09 20:21:50 Yeahhh bfa hasn't been that great for the stocks.
1426 2019-02-09 20:17:37 I LOVE IT!  What else did you google!
Ahahahahahahashshhahahaahahh.

You really do believe youre fooling me, don't you?

Youve never even asked once why i know anything about stocks.
1427 2019-02-09 20:17:08 Blizzard stocks have tanked, yikey
1428 2019-02-09 20:15:16 I’m focusing on the cash reserve now.  Locked up in too many stocks...
1429 2019-02-09 20:15:10 Bad timing for a crafty investor who seems to be much more adept in timing the behavior of stocks rather than the real estate market
1430 2019-02-09 20:14:32 stocks fridge for the next month on healthy snacks. almost eats everything in a week.

1433 2019-02-09 20:11:41 Maybe the stock went down because many of Teslas board members except of Elon were selling their stocks.
1434 2019-02-09 20:10:39 More than 11 million jobs were created under Obama, who inherited soaring unemployment rate and an economic recession. While stocks have steadily risen since March 2009, the deficit to GDP ratio significantly dropped over the course of his eight-year tenure.
1435 2019-02-09 20:10:33 Oui, ce qui se passe est du jamais vu... ça va durer encore longtemps ce cirque... ? ils ont encore beaucoup de stocks de flashball et de grenades à écouler... ? quelle tristesse... quelles images... quelle incompétence de ce gouvernement...
1436 2019-02-09 20:10:24 But sell the stock. Peaked around 2100...even Amazon is going to follow valuation rules. Booking com did as well as other 4 digit large cap stocks.
1437 2019-02-09 20:10:02 Will post a few setups this weekend, including entry suggestions and key prices/pivots to watch.

1438 2019-02-09 20:09:24 It’s silly to throw money away in the VIP if you do have 500k in stocks and insurance. Let’s build money AND character.
1439 2019-02-09 20:08:49 Merci. Cool. Ca semble sympa. Je fais des stocks de conserves. Je suis flexi-stock-vore.

1442 2019-02-09 20:07:16 @Wealthsimple I started using your app and I put some money in the Tfsa account and it’s not letting me buy any stocks. Please help
1443 2019-02-09 20:06:19 Fellas...

Unless you have at least $500k in stocks, and the same amount in life insurance for your kids, it’s downright insane to throw money away showboating, or throwing money away at strip clubs!
1444 2019-02-09 20:04:53 Die Zahlen werden - wie alle Prognosen in Sachen Migration - sicher sehr zurückhaltend gewählt sein und übertroffen werden. Dem Institut kann man sicher keine AfD Nähe nachsagen - oder sind wirtschaftliche ungünstige Prognosen i.d. Angelegenheit auch schon „Nazi“?
1445 2019-02-09 20:02:45 Many stocks I follow including the Dow Jones is roughly at the same value as of the same time last year- 2018 was a Stock Market plateau which does not indicate a strong economy.
1446 2019-02-09 20:02:33 I think you should invest in kleenex stocks for 2020 for Trump's landslide victory.

See his approval rating Hakeem? Keeps going up now.

1450 2019-02-09 20:01:09 Can't afford the products themselves but will happily boycott any department store that stocks them. That might send a message home?
1451 2019-02-09 20:01:04 I love the financial markets; Stocks, Crypto. But the opportunities in Real Estate are absolutely ludicrous!!
#investing
1452 2019-02-09 20:00:47 just buy the stocks that go up and sell them if they don't.
1453 2019-02-09 20:00:16 Dont let the FACTS of Obama taking office in a RECESSION  losing hundreds of thousands of jobs per month. Stocks at 7500 and unemployment of 13%. Left at 19000 and unemployment at 4.7% He gift wrapped the economy you take credit for. Facts dont matter to you and your sheep. #SCAM
1454 2019-02-09 20:00:09 30% short interest. With cannabis stocks on fire in 2019, if earnings are OK, could see $30+ next week, IMO.
1455 2019-02-09 19:58:41 No where ever stocks the peach dye I use tho smh the snakes
1456 2019-02-09 19:57:51 Nope. He will be too busy insider trading and manipulating stocks.
1457 2019-02-09 19:57:18 1) The amount of negative yields globally; 2) The low quality of indenture agreements; 3) Bill Gross, the "bond king", retires after years of poor results. Does this mean that the bond asset class has become "impaired?" Do investors (and allocators) now have only stocks or cash?
1458 2019-02-09 19:57:04 I’m press I just found a app I can invest in stocks 
1459 2019-02-09 19:54:06 Dipped my toes in a few reasonable penny stocks but still on the sidelines for  plays . Not that all pot stock valuations aren’t crazy but few retail stores = billions in market cap?I still feel like there’s downside to  it’s still to early,waiting for this summer dip IMO
1460 2019-02-09 19:52:51 I really beg to differ. The bulls, for the most part, are just pontificating on the stocks they love, while bears act like they have PHDs in Econ, are experts in global shipping metrics, and throw out scare tactic BS like an imminent nuclear war (Alpha Analytics or All Fraud).
1461 2019-02-09 19:51:55 My Shooters Stay Vested Like My Stocks !
1462 2019-02-09 19:51:22 If she's not a reader, don't marry her. Have you heard the story of man that married a lazy reader. Man does not have a bank account but stocks his money in all the books in the house and tells his wife he doesn't have money.  Ignorance makes you lose everything. Everything!
1463 2019-02-09 19:50:40 People were also starting to get out of the market because they could get 3% on a treasury with no risk and that scared the 1% to death because they own 80% of the stocks so naturally the FED caters to them since the banks are the fed's clients anyway.
1464 2019-02-09 19:49:18 Civil unrest is coming to the UK.  Big or small?

UK Army on the ready, Queen ready to evacuate, emergency stocks everywhere

1469 2019-02-09 19:48:51 I get your point, however practically speaking, given the high correlation of stocks are across all markets, that is a distinction without a difference.
1470 2019-02-09 19:48:48 $LFAP Is SHORTED HEAVILY! PLACE your BUY ORDERS on the ASK! This is going to be 1 for the AGES! Look for $1.00+ this week! #LGBT #stockstowatch #STOCKS #OTC
1471 2019-02-09 19:48:09 Not even once.
Did you know that stocks can be improved by hard work, if the hard work is combined with good ideas, and this increases the share of the stock, and the purchase itself does very little?
I think they will cover that in your high school business classes.

1474 2019-02-09 19:45:22 Check & see their donations to members of Congress & those in the trump admin. Mass shootings happen with AR15s and bump stocks. Congress’s refusal to take up any type of sensible gun reform makes them beholden to the nra which makes them a team thats complicit in these shootings
1475 2019-02-09 19:43:42 I want to learn about stocks
1476 2019-02-09 19:43:42 You and Schiff are literally two of the most useless Reps. Try for a friggin second to stop this TDS. You both are becoming laughing stocks.
1477 2019-02-09 19:42:54 @PMartin1867 we were talking about stocks, could this work ?
1478 2019-02-09 19:42:10 @aoc then store the stocks in a IRA to avoid paying taxes and gain again more money his way?? Correct...so loop hole king will attempt to do this 2-3 months before his term ends most likely.
1479 2019-02-09 19:42:05 I can’t wait until I have enough money to buy a gigantic amount of stocks in companies so self proclaimed neo liberals get mad at a woman for owning the majority of the company.
1480 2019-02-09 19:40:37 Fake news! Hot Pockets! Mom's basement!

None of us makes real contributions to society like Ross, who plows other people's money into "hot" stocks for a living.
1481 2019-02-09 19:40:19 @aoc so he techniclly does not need to buy them himself. He can exchange his networking gains as currency for the stocks

1484 2019-02-09 19:38:18 no they are buying their stock back because they are worried the stock market will crash and the stocks will be cheep making them vulnerable to take overs, You should know these things to be President
1485 2019-02-09 19:38:07 Shame on u @segeeto for not taking on those who refused to provide even the narrow gauge train services (no matter the type of Coaches and Rolling Stocks).
You probably was somewhere enjoying the slush funds they wld have used to make the trains roll & u're here shaming yourself.
1486 2019-02-09 19:37:47 Those “job killing Regulations and Roadblocks” came into being over decades to protect workers & environment. You only see $$$. Stocks soar which doesn’t help the workers who will have health issues, no health insurance, dirty water & air. And you don’t care. Thanks for nothing.
1487 2019-02-09 19:37:28 @AOC hey! So i was thinking. Trump buys stocks deregulates it soars as you stated which is true...then bam! Stocks, bonds or any other securities can be transferred as gifts. Giving the gift of stock also has benefits for the giver. If the stock has appreciated in value.
1488 2019-02-09 19:37:17 Actually, the equity market meet that definition to a 'T'. Hold a 10-20% equity allocation and your are roundly criticized by both wall street and main street for not being fully invested. That's the world of stocks.

1492 2019-02-09 19:34:36 Does the NRA plan on calling for the ATF to re-examine, and regulate this like you did on the bump stocks?
1493 2019-02-09 19:34:35 The middle class is the working class's path to more wealth.  Don't forget that. It's why the 1% needs to destroy it.  You're taking away some of their wealth when you can invest in real estate and stocks and make money. This is simple & timeless. #maga #MAGA2KAG #MAGAtaxREGRETS
1494 2019-02-09 19:33:28 I used Palutena on quickplay yesterday and I can't stop thinking about this one match:

3stock matchs. First I get 2 stocked by a little Mac, they briefly teabag after I lost my second stock...
Rematch-
Nearly 3 stocks them and annoys them by spamming B.
All is good in the world.
1495 2019-02-09 19:33:21 Never?  Although there are some stocks and/or ETFs that follow that path.
1496 2019-02-09 19:32:56 That I will agree on, as stocks are only as good as the P/E ratios and bonds are only as good as the tax payers ability to pay. But without a stable form of money (i.e. fiat currency), all cycles regardless of asset class will become more pronounced and increasingly volatile.
1497 2019-02-09 19:32:32 Your greatest tone Ajju bhai ####### I see and support to Rajasthan royals because Ajinkya Sanju and Watson Ben stocks  Steven smith Jos butler @and some and Mamagememt staffs Rahul sir and Romi sir and more all up sir   God bless you RR forever
1498 2019-02-09 19:32:02 What’s your definition of “earning” ? At that level, wealthy income comes from appreciation of property, stocks, funds, etc. their wealth isn’t necessarily blue collar boots on the ground- if that’s what you’re getting at.  Additionally, they can afford it.
1499 2019-02-09 19:31:15 If you think Satoshi coming back is a blessing, I suggest you sell any crypto you have and put it into traditional stocks.
1500 2019-02-09 19:30:24 Hi dividend stocks in an IRA that do not accrued immediate taxes.
1501 2019-02-09 19:29:46 So happy about that below in “ “as I won’t be living off income anymore and will make much more and pay much less % wise over those that have to work! (Mad yet?) “Qualified dividends on stocks and stock mutual funds are eligible for the same lower maximum 15% rate.”

1505 2019-02-09 19:26:23 Because desyncing was not the proper way to play, I play with items, no stocks, time, stamina, every item on high, and I main IC's and I do perfectly fine >:( Play the game right !!!! >:( (im just trolling dont hurt me)
1506 2019-02-09 19:26:03 Just Buy all the Big Canadian Cannabis Stocks. Get Rich Quick and Retire this year. Buy Buy Buy. Lambo Soon.
1507 2019-02-09 19:25:45 The #stocks buyback boogie man is pretty lame as there are a significant number of factors that go into the decisions.

Additionally a substantial number if #citizens own stock either directly or indirectly!
1508 2019-02-09 19:24:26 There is a time for gold...there is time for stocks and there is a time for bonds depending where you are in economic and political cycle.

1510 2019-02-09 19:23:23 Put more in the paychecks but kept tax liability the same. And took away deductions that work for us little guys. Then tried to sell the same old trickle-down BS, while the big guys bought back stocks and laughed in our faces. Paul Ryan’s smug smile says it all.
1511 2019-02-09 19:23:19 @stockduniya sir, kindly let us know your high conviction stocks after this quarterly results.
1512 2019-02-09 19:23:03 Why? The man is a criminal and wanted by law in several nations. He's a thief through and through and a fraud. He can't help himself. Even in Pakistan he committed securities fraud and manipulated stocks. He's a pathological crook.
1513 2019-02-09 19:22:25 Indeed. Just money is not wealth. There should be some real estate in the mix, and stocks.
1514 2019-02-09 19:22:20 When stocks collapsed, long term rates plummeted, rendering the feds lowering of rates a crock. When they got into the game, it actually propped rates back up. Hmmm.
1515 2019-02-09 19:22:19 I prefer tax act, but that's because I dont have any assets or stocks or investments, etc. Turbo Tax is what you want to use if you have any assets or property.
1516 2019-02-09 19:21:54 @LukeGromen , hoping you might share some insight--if you had to allocate your portfolio for the next 5 years between stocks, cash or TIPS (no gold option after Vanguard nixed their PM fund) which would you choose?  Muchas gracias.
1517 2019-02-09 19:21:12 only an idiot would buy stocks because it’s not “hard” to do so. We’re in agreement realize it or not.
1518 2019-02-09 19:19:35 I'd hardly call it a plummeting stock, It's just about standard across game stocks that they have dipped. If they are getting rid of jobs they hold in the parent company I don't see any reason to go chicken little. Though everything is rumor and speculation currently.
1519 2019-02-09 19:19:19 everyone should pay for national defense. Everyone should own dividend stocks is defense corporations  as they are the most protected/reliable of all businesses to invest.

1530 2019-02-09 19:09:57 Bernie, when a company buys back its stock, it increases the value of the stock for the shareholders. Do you know what progams invest in a lot of stocks? 401K programs!! Why do you hate workers with 401K investments that increase in value?

1532 2019-02-09 19:09:37 Yeah items and stocks is a little wack. But w timed match would make it a little more chaotic which would be entertaining. You could definitely have 2 though. But it is what it is. I just want to see some carnage and clean combos.
1533 2019-02-09 19:07:28 You can't have 2, which is why they mixed it. The use of stocks with items is not a great mix, which is why I think Time battles would be more appropriate. But one can't have everything.
1534 2019-02-09 19:05:58 Banks frontrunning the Fed "discussions" around QE infinity. There is literally no other reason for the reversal. Strange how stocks react but USD doesn't. The manipulation focused on ensuring stocks stay pumped.

1536 2019-02-09 19:03:22 Where are you guys seeing this dilution? I thought when a company printed more stocks or did anything that might influence the stock price they had to submit an 8K to the SEC. Not seeing any recent SEC filings.

1548 2019-02-09 18:50:00 Middle class people are paying MORE in taxes and Cramer promoted this tax plan. Stocks are negative 6% in 2018 despite giving corporations and rich people more subsidies. Cramer is not a good person, I wish him an unhappy birthday. 
1549 2019-02-09 18:48:50 Haha for real! You see, this is what I mean when I said that for some reason in this game I get tilted so easily! It is probably because I play Fox and a few mistakes on my side can make me lose stocks in seconds, but with Diddy on Smash 4 I had a bigger margin of error 
1550 2019-02-09 18:48:46 Stocks are a representation of the value of the company, and the more shares a person (or corporation) holds increases the percentage of the company they own.  Everything you said is wrong.  You must be trying to "troll".

Great job Cody now pick a few stocks that are this good and we all could retire.

Stocks should be brought back into this decade in every town. There's a prime site outside a rotund building in Welly.

1577 2019-02-09 18:23:29 Unfortunately the system is such that it discourages such ethical concern, & most of the stocks are held by big funds driven solely by making as much profit as possible for themselves & will demand cuts in staff, higher hours, lower pay, destruction of unions,anything for profit

Last thing I think about in a POTUS candidate is her/his effect on capital markets—which, as most other presidents other than the present shitbird have understood, is tangential at best. A good understanding of micro/macro econ would be a desirable trait.

1584 2019-02-09 18:17:22 Interesting. So even if the broad spectrum of yield curves fall, if there is a significantly increased falling (purchasing of bonds) on longer term bonds / yields, it is bullish for the economy and stocks?

1587 2019-02-09 18:14:44 Read Monetary Policy buddy!
As interest rate rises, the cost to do business increase, therefore less investments from private companies> less Econ growth> stocks fall.
For example: If a company wants to expand, issue $100M bonds @ 2% =$2M cost.
if @ 5% = $5M = less investments.

1608 2019-02-09 17:58:53 Until recently, where I live all you needed was a driver's license until we smartened up and raised the age of buying to 21 and banned bump stocks. You can also go on the Internet and circumvent gun laws completely.

1624 2019-02-09 17:48:22 Exactly what I was thinking. Exports didnt increase, it was imports that decreased. Decreased consumer spending will trickle down to US stocks shortly.

1626 2019-02-09 17:46:46 The problem in this instance is one which affects all Americans to one degree or another. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates as a response to the 2008 crash. This created an 'asset bubble' in stocks, real estate, etc. which drove home prices up. Property taxes skyrocketed.
1627 2019-02-09 17:46:22 The first thing that needs to happen is property tax relief,  I know that that’s more state based but is extremely costly.  The second would be not manipulating the stocks to hold a price level....

1631 2019-02-09 17:44:09 The right wing media is to genuine debate what high freq trading is to owning stocks.

1645 2019-02-09 17:37:35 this is a reach but maybe jyp invested in bighit’s stocks?? can’t think of anything else to this rumor
1646 2019-02-09 17:36:16 Sure, aber die tl;dr ist: Lies nicht zu viel in Stocks rein.
1647 2019-02-09 17:35:14 Doesn’t that prove that they’re disinterested? Those stocks could just be market weight of a broad equity portfolio. Wouldn’t it be worse if they were funded by O&G?
1648 2019-02-09 17:35:07 Because trump and the GOP don't give a dam, and probably own stocks in the companies that own them. When they get booted out of their swamp they can lobby for the Payday lenders and make millions. They love $$, hate poor people.

1650 2019-02-09 17:32:50 Time to invest in some stocks
1651 2019-02-09 17:32:29 I do have stocks in laserdisc, yes
1652 2019-02-09 17:30:37 Les gilets bleus et leur capacité incroyable d'indignation sélective, les stocks de lacry et de lbd, ca t'ennuie pas, les cice et autres cadeaux aux riches, non plus mais une caisse en feu c'est la grosse larmiche.
1653 2019-02-09 17:27:17 They are not stupid questions..good ones actually. Options don’t trade overnight (on stocks) so it’s “okay” to hold them for more than a day. Most brokers will end up sending the email late at night once it has been cleared.
1654 2019-02-09 17:27:03 As a $bilz shareholder I agree. Dan @danbilzerian call Jason @WolfOfWeedST. Jason is the authority on cannabis stocks.
1655 2019-02-09 17:24:57 When will Dems in Congress lead by example, Congress should rid themselves of the exemption from Ocare @AOC, & @SenWarren should now get rid of all her stocks b/c the stocks have corrupted her! @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @BreitbartNews @TeamTrump @SCTeamTrump @Everyvote4trump
1656 2019-02-09 17:24:42 I do questrade for big board stocks and rbc for penny stocks. Questrade interface/reliability is the best but ECN fees can add up on cheap stocks
1657 2019-02-09 17:24:33 Obama was the worst President in America's history and did nothing for America or it's citizens. We have a lot better economy now. Look at the stocks. And the gas prices are so low now. Thanks President Trump !
1658 2019-02-09 17:23:54 Holy shit. I’m sad it took this much scrolling to find the right answer! These people have never heard of dividend stocks! Insane!
1659 2019-02-09 17:23:52 Basically the president can put stocks in oil and then cause them to raise in prices with a law, granting him more money from said stocks. He could also pay people to keep secrets of his campaign “hush money”.
1660 2019-02-09 17:22:41 En même temps il y avait beaucoup de prévus plus les stocks étaient blindés !
1661 2019-02-09 17:22:16 You can’t just say buying xrp is smart. Is buying stocks smart? All depends on the market state. I already discussed for the past few days the reason retail and even institutional investors will buy xrp for investments, because demand for xrp will increase price. Same for all DAs
1662 2019-02-09 17:22:14 It’s also easy to look at that chart and realize that there was no where to go but up. It was a recession. You could buy stocks like Citigroup for $2 a share (worth$26) Now we’ve reached a point of extension with unemployment still hitting all time low & steady at 4.0%.
1663 2019-02-09 17:21:21 Wait what? Elizabeth #Warren2020 ....you don’t trade ANY stocks? Even poor lil ol’ school teachers like me do that!!!
1664 2019-02-09 17:20:32 Pretty sure you have stocks in big business and are in bed with lobbyists just like the @GOP
1665 2019-02-09 17:20:32 “How do we root out corruption? Shut down the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington. Ban lobbying as we know it. Ban MOPs from trading stocks. How is that not already illegal?! And make every candidate for federal office put their taxes online.” #Warren2020
1666 2019-02-09 17:20:24 I know you are a lawyer, stated on your bio. However, we do not follow you for your legal theory. We follow you because of your abilities with stocks. I voted for trump and will again. But the constant one sided arguments from you / most Trumpers is killing our party.
1667 2019-02-09 17:20:04 The long option can only be exercised by the buyer (himself). So I think the 46K is the margin for shorting 100 stocks of AMZN.
1668 2019-02-09 17:19:39 Warren: "Ban members of congress from buying & trading stocks, how is that already not illegal!?"
1669 2019-02-09 17:19:28 "Shut down the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington. End lobbying as we know it. Ban members of Congress from trading stocks. Make every candidate put their taxes online."

1670 2019-02-09 17:18:44 A value could be 1 dollar or 5000 dollars.  That is catastrophe or euphoria depending on timing of purchase.  There is a time for gold (commodities), a time for bonds and a time for stocks.  The US dollar buys you more today than gold did compared to 8 years ago.

1672 2019-02-09 17:17:01 Read Monetary Policy buddy!
As interest rate rises, the cost to do business increase, therefore less investments from private companies> less Econ growth> stocks fall.
For example: If a company wants to expand, issue $100M bonds @ 2% =$2M cost.
if @ 5% = $5M = less investments.

1686 2019-02-09 17:04:39 So many people seem to be making so much money from stocks but I’m definitely not brave enough to gamble £500, although turning it in to £5000 would be fab

5. Since corporate donations are not actual Dark Money (as stated in earlier post), all unethical/illegal activities become immediately apparent.

What does $1.00 mean to you? Not much in the grand scheme of things or to most people in general. Although, $1.00 means the world to some.
Now, what does a $1.00 valuation mean to you? Imagine your heaviest investment at a $1.00 valuation...

1721 2019-02-09 16:38:03 How u define quality
What was quality yesterday is not quality today.
Assume HDFC, Maruti had gone to Rs 10, you would have told, look quality stocks like suzlon and rcom.
So success is quality, failure is no quality.
Can you tell which is quality now, we will see 10 year later.

1733 2019-02-09 16:30:10 People hv given only Rs 50 lakhs to these PMS and invested more than 5 Crore in the same stocks (just to save the PMS cost). The actual damage is more than 10X. Eg.

1764 2019-02-09 16:11:14 Wells Fargo is continuing the two year decline of a once great bank. The two day system's failure was not a cyber security event, the company stated. Thus it was an internal management shortcoming.  The risk for Wells is greater than the market assessment. #Wells #stocks #Risk

1768 2019-02-09 16:09:09 Dune is explicitly about US and European foreign policy vis a vis Middle Eastern Oil. Further, the Emperor's primary motive to attack the Atreides was because their feud with the Harkonnens could imperil the value of his CHOAM stocks by destabilizing oil, I mean SPICE, prices.

1804 2019-02-09 15:45:58 That gets into the question of college financial-aid eligibility. But if you're thinking of buying stocks when your kids are toddlers, you're probably not the family that'll get a whole lot of aid. Just a hunch.

1809 2019-02-09 15:43:52 I think energy and metal (precious and base) stocks are beaten-down enough to make the better quality names good vehicles to safely trade below (buy) and above (sell) 10-20 moving averages.  That's basically my system. This year energy should figure prominently in that.

1817 2019-02-09 15:41:01 If they reversed the share buy backs and sold  stocks to raise funding wouldn't that crash their value and executive bonuses too?

1841 2019-02-09 15:25:57 For better or worse, indexing is actually active management.

1853 2019-02-09 15:16:08 Actually, she is ENTIRELY wrong on writing laws in companies where you own stocks.

The securities and exchange commission would charge insider trading in a heartbeat which is why it is not necessary in campaign law.
1854 2019-02-09 15:15:38 Kind of skeptical buying stocks tbh. Looks like we may have topped last year on DJI and S&P. If we have a full market cycle on stocks I would expect a drop of ~80% on the big majority of stocks

1886 2019-02-09 14:51:04 disagree wit that. rates are still near 5000 year lows. housing is near every prior recession low since the 1950s even before hikes started.
this has nothing to do with the fed funds move from .25

1892 2019-02-09 14:46:17 And that's where you run into the main issue - if executives are mostly paid in stocks, they are going to only be willing to lead the company in the direction that leads to the biggest short term gains, ESPECIALLY if they get gigantic golden parachutes after crashing the ship

1895 2019-02-09 14:45:04 (2/2) I invest when I believe the conditions... are probably not permanent... you can't be short-term oriented with this investment philosophy. If you're going to worry about short-term volatility, you're just not going to be able to buy the cheapest stocks. -- Rich Pzena

1900 2019-02-09 14:42:37 Another regressive tax idea that, unless it is coupled with a tax credits for the poor, will disproportionately impact those who live pay check to pay check.   Replace with a 1% tax on trading stocks and bonds and abolish the reduction of tax rates on capital gains.

I read a lot about trading. I recommend Supertrader from VanTharp, both books from Mark Minervini and "How to make money in Stocks" from O'neil. There is all you Need to know.
And then you need to get the charting skills with practicing.
1909 2019-02-09 14:35:23 (1/2) Agreed, but like $SMAR $OKTA and $ROKU (just to name a few) I believe it's still too early. Studies show leading stocks tend to make their biggest moves when earnings & sales growth are driving the stock price. $NVTA has the fantastic sales growth but still hasn't made $...

1914 2019-02-09 14:28:03 It’s silly to ban bump stocks.  You can bump fire without a bump stock.  And you want a gun banned because of the way it looks.  Don’t you think you should educate yourself on the topic?  You’re asking for peoples rights to be taken away.

1989 2019-02-09 13:26:28 OK.  Since you are more into volatile stocks i assume u must be entering trades with a RR of 1: 3 at least and trailing ur profitable trades n landing with more than 3R returns on some days. Just an educated guess

1991 2019-02-09 13:23:58 Exactly. PTSD of ‘08 still lingers. People forget a 2-3 quarter slowdown in output, with a typical bear mkt in stocks, *followed by a recovery in both*, is the most likely outcome. An off the charts frothy expansion, or devastating crisis is the realm of the unhinged fringe.

2007 2019-02-09 13:00:11 2018 was a record-setting year. Unfortunately, that’s because it was actually the worst year for stocks since 2008.

2009 2019-02-09 12:59:05 Today in 1871 The [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] began life as the U.S. Commission on Fish and Fisheries, created to study and recommend solutions to a decline in the stocks of food fish. Spencer Fullerton Baird was appointed its first commissioner.
2010 2019-02-09 12:58:58 This was an interesting way of seeing things regarding Congress.  When we plan retirement savings, we tend to invest in stocks.  If we want Congress to plan for their retirement and not just have a lifeling check, what would they invest in?
2011 2019-02-09 12:58:08 I can confirm this. For the mom and pop stores, you are still getting plastic bags and straw...at first I thought, they were trying to finish out their stocks but now I think they don't plan to comply.

2013 2019-02-09 12:55:39 Some platforms have made their business election centric , even people start investment in media stocks at this time. This is scary ! Twitter is no exception ! It's driven by political clients as usual !

2031 2019-02-09 12:33:30 real answer, like everything else in life, is somewhere between the two extremes.
capitalism is good, our own greed has made it evil. We demand our stocks return high profit & then wonder why the biz has layoffs or exports jobs & mfg to save $.
Perhaps limit profits?

2138 2019-02-09 10:38:45 Talking of valuations? Even the best frontline stocks are expensive. A great disparity seen in mid cap n large caps. We are in bear mkt already? Would be great to analyse how many stocks at life time high and others??

2140 2019-02-09 10:34:36 #Business #Marketing  When the prices of consumer goods and services fell, stock returns were terrible- with the market losing up to 30-40% of its value.when the inflation shot above 6-7%, stocks also stank.

2157 2019-02-09 10:02:20 I worked for banks for 17 years, including in settlement and IT, and I have literally never before heard anyone say that banks have "dormant money" in nostros or hold "liquidity reserves" in nostros. Nostro balances can be huge, but they are moving money, not idle stocks.

2176 2019-02-09 09:31:52 The big whammer is the 18% - the only thing shareholders (which often take the form of managed fonds which wanna charge their own customers for exceptionally high returns on investment) care about is that 18%.

2179 2019-02-09 09:26:25 Nope. Lots of international agreements on stocks and quotas. But the biggest issue is who we sell the fish to. We don't eat much fish! Our industry is set up to supply Europe in lorries really fast. That's it. That would take years to change, trawlers go bust quickly.
2180 2019-02-09 09:24:00 The title should really be Why Stocks Do So Little For Americans.  The vast majority of Americans have no stock holdings and gain nothing when the valuation of the market or individual stocks increase.
2181 2019-02-09 09:23:56 Last but not least, Congress allows lobby money, super pacts   money and campaign contributions to dictate their votes on bills. They also wrote a bill that allows them to buy and sell stocks using insider information.

2183 2019-02-09 09:18:55 For stocks, the gains n losses cancel out up to $50K. Then $3K can be written off against ordinary income during that year. If losses exceed gains by >$3K, then it’ll have to carry over to future tax years. Is it the same with cryptos? Ty in advance.

2196 2019-02-09 09:00:31 The hard work for you in finding and recommending the stocks.

2197 2019-02-09 08:57:39 "you have to cut out most of the game to play competitive smash so it's not real smash" is such a dumb fucking argument. we have the option to turn off items and only play on some stages and play with stocks because the game lets us in order to let everyone play how they want.
2198 2019-02-09 08:54:28 Not really. They can't afford to. Stocks will tank and Board will kick @Jack & others out. Investors don't care a hoot about their leftist ideology. It's the $s. And with India, it isn't about the AMU right now. It's about, what it could be.

2242 2019-02-09 07:57:17 A better way is liquid funds.....arbitrage funds are a time bomb in my view....in such volatile times...when fno stocks move like 30-40% down or up in a matter of minutes...it can backfire for a mere 7% return

Go liquid funds and have a peaceful life no?...
2243 2019-02-09 07:55:05 So can we consider people that invest money repeatedly in high returning stocks as creators of social good on par with people who create similar amounts via more direct forms of compensation?
2244 2019-02-09 07:53:42 Really good times ahead, even the digital assets Market cap looks bullish. Guess its a response to the positive crypto news stimuli. Look at @AbraGlobal  which now allows you to  invest in 30 cryptocurrencies, 50 fiat currencies, and very soon global "stocks and ETFs"

2256 2019-02-09 07:35:53 namili ako sa korean stocks nang nakapambahay lang waw self di ka na maarte 
2257 2019-02-09 07:35:45 But whats ur conviction on that.. If i invested with my own money.. Should i sell it off dhfl, ashok leylend or stay invested in these stocks?
2258 2019-02-09 07:35:26 And why would stock value increase? Generally, because the company provided more goods/services which people pay for, gaining more revenue and subsequent profit. The company also has to pay its employees, who buy stuff. Buying stocks is not spending on nothing.

2262 2019-02-09 07:30:55 At some point I felt that $URA follows stocks, when commodities were rising, but $URA didn't. However, recently it seems like it is repeating what gold and silver do.
2263 2019-02-09 07:30:45 why do y'all buy jewelry w no monetary value in the future instead of investing y'all money into a property or buying stocks?

2265 2019-02-09 07:29:29 I made huge call on EA stocks when they were on sell off bc of Apex to buy but I didn’t go through. Now they jumped from 75 to rough $100 a stock. Could’ve made huge cash instantly so I’m big sad :/

2269 2019-02-09 07:28:40 Been watching their stocks drop since the Diablo Casual reveal. 
Love it.
2270 2019-02-09 07:28:39 And we have a specialist store in Perth that stocks your books - should be a slam dunk ;-)
2271 2019-02-09 07:27:09 Sorry  There were very limited stocks available
2272 2019-02-09 07:26:40 Another set of promises?
I think governments, in this kind of season, should be taking stocks of meaningful achievements and not unrealistic promises.
2273 2019-02-09 07:25:13 It really is SO TRAGIC to witness the rapid decline & bellyflop of @Clicks_SA . No stocks of generics, shoddier & shoddier service, cluttered aisles & generally mismanaged stores. Almost as bad as @Dischem ! We've gone back to the great small pharmacies where there's REAL care!
2274 2019-02-09 07:25:03 I'm aware that he's chubby & fat. But I'm also aware that's where he stocks his muscle. I still love him lol. But to say what Gary said is a no in my book b lol. But y'all essentially out calling me fat lmao.
2275 2019-02-09 07:20:17 I don't trade crypto so maybe it requires more lines than stocks but I'd recommend focusing more on Price Action and volume. Although, crypto is highly manipulated so getting a good read is nearly impossible.
2276 2019-02-09 07:18:35 Most people miss  the fact (and this is in the SEC filing) that Durkin can't even vest those stocks until March 2020 AND only if ATVI as a whole does good financial speaking (this would include the stock price rising)
2277 2019-02-09 07:17:28 I suggest u do this research on EOD stocks & then make a watchlist for next day. If you are using Amibroker, you can use AFL which can help you scan these 3 types -
NR4 (smallest range of 4 days)
NR7 (smallest range of 7 days)

This will help u pick volatility contraction stocks.

2284 2019-02-09 07:11:47 And how might a huge financial crash impact on BTC.  That’s what I think about.    Will people pull investment cash out of BTC, or pile into it as a potential safe haven, or means of diversification from stocks to reduce risk?
2285 2019-02-09 07:11:34 Last stock feels worse than 2 stocks imo
2286 2019-02-09 07:10:10 What are arbitrage funds......y should they exist?.....some take positions on stocks like vakrangee,dhfl...........wats the need?
2287 2019-02-09 07:08:50 Couldn't agree more that the 21st Century version of cookbooks is an excellent resource. One suggestion is to pick a basic flavour (beef, tomato etc) and work around that. Oh, and things like stocks and tomato puree are your friends 
2288 2019-02-09 07:05:48 Luxury stocks are under rated by asset managers. 6% average ROI and not cyclical they make for good fixed income investmemt.
2289 2019-02-09 07:04:00 Index funds like Nifty 50 index fund are also borderline momentum funds as stocks (constituents) which rise more attract more inflows due to rising weightage.

2293 2019-02-09 07:00:43 Yeah, I see what you mean. This probably fell below the support level I had set for it rather than bounce from it like others stocks I've traded previously because it was brought up by manipulators as there wasn't really any positive catalyst (news).
2294 2019-02-09 07:00:25 That's true. Kindly share if you know any of such stocks. Thanks.
2295 2019-02-09 06:59:30 I am currently a @Questrade customer and the conditions they impose on you to be their customer are just wrong. $1000 minimum to open your account. $4.95 commission on buying and selling stocks (even though it was the lowest yet in Canada) and horrible service.

2301 2019-02-09 06:52:09 There was around $500 million invested in bank stocks on Monday while only the govt had the report and we already know the PM was colluding with bank executives the day this all began. When is the Australian media going to do their job? #insiders

2303 2019-02-09 06:47:02 I wanted to know if there is an indicator which indicates volatility of a stock is increasing in the live market ... So. That one doesn't has to sit there all day long .As volatile stocks move fast and profit or loss is sooner
2304 2019-02-09 06:46:42 Paul Craig Roberts has described how this system works. There are forward markets for currencies, stocks and bonds. The Federal Reserve can offer to buy a stock in three months at, say, 10% over the current price. -Michael Hudson

2308 2019-02-09 06:42:35 As part of an argument against the affordability of #GreenNewDeal in terms of real resources (carbon budget, ecological buffer capacity, non renewable resource stocks) this objection has merit. Is that what people mean when they say “we can’t afford it”?
2309 2019-02-09 06:40:40 How many stocks in your left column we have bought at inception of fund do check. And I noted it when you alleged Titan around 700 was momentum buy; what about earnings trajectory since we bought. Annual churn since 5 yr is <30% whereas industry is over 100% so what’s momentum?
2310 2019-02-09 06:40:39 Of course we could just take the opportunity to replenish fish stocks. The only problem then, is those extra traitorous fish will simply swim across to EU waters. We should ban that sort of behaviour. Fish passports? Blue of course!

2320 2019-02-09 06:29:55 Indian stock market is for punters. No company will be spared. If a breakout happens stocks move up by 2-3% whereas in down trends stocks go down 50% trapping retail investors. It’s a shitty den.
2321 2019-02-09 06:28:17 If I buy a stock for the first time and it goes down 8% after buying, I generally sell it at loss. My valuation reading gone wrong here.
If my PF/stocks down 8 or 50% and I am confident about my holding, I'll hold or buy, if possible.

Clear?

2359 2019-02-10 23:36:34 I agree that increased dividends are good for stock owners. But my dividends didn’t go up anywhere near enough to make up for the tax hit we are getting this year. AND the majority of Americans, who not only didn’t receive the promised jobs, don’t have enough money to own stocks.

2364 2019-02-10 23:28:30 I have sworn off trading stocks.  Never made any money after all these many years.  Buying silver bars every month and watching the stack grow. You may still be here tomorrow but your dreams may not.
2365 2019-02-10 23:27:44 True, A focus on 2-3 percent inflation helps stocks and real estate which are both good hedges against moderate inflation
2366 2019-02-10 23:27:03 Okay you have a point Kyle. The Salem GAS cars/CRA street stocks are fun. A leaf spring Camaro on a flat 1/4 probably isn’t as much fun.

2368 2019-02-10 23:24:44 Not a sign that will bother the homeless or those struggling under austerity. Stopping Brexit will help everyone. Buy stocks now while they're cheap and then persuade TM to revoke Article 50 and abandon Brexit.

2370 2019-02-10 23:23:10 Did you know theres a thing called "The Stock Market"? And in this market people buy and sell stock

The more you buy the price goes up
The more you sell the price goes down

Thats just the absolute basic fundamental of a stocks "supply & demand"

Say it with me supply & demand
2371 2019-02-10 23:22:57 Maybe the GAS cars, but surely not all street stocks are fun Baden. Lol
2372 2019-02-10 23:20:39 My taxable account holds Novartis. I very much prefer a share buyback to a dividend from them, even though they are not a US corporation. The analysis you posted excludes all ownership of foreign stocks.

2374 2019-02-10 23:20:10 not quite. if the real estate market falls -50%, many will give their keys back to the institute who actually owns the house: the bank. And let’s hope their stock market portfolio isn’t related to margins either. Besides, I am sure, most won’t be relaxed with stocks -50% either.
2375 2019-02-10 23:19:35 I've seen some street stocks that are spending "modified" money. Everything in racing is expensive. It is what it is, though.

2381 2019-02-10 23:11:23 On the other side , while we wait for Chinese stocks we can gain with software companies $OKTA $BEAT $AYX $TWLO $MEDP $ROKU $MDB $SQ $VEEV $HUBS $PS $PSTG $ZEN $ZUO $ZS $YEXT . Some lagging , other in ATH, some with great bounces since lows. All kind of opportunities
2382 2019-02-10 23:09:07 Capital investment. Improving his own current businesses or obtaining more control of stocks, etc. capital investments are a great tax break. He gets a tax break on the business loan and a tax break on capital improvement. Double win.
2383 2019-02-10 23:07:52 Be ready for many Chinese stocks after holiday week in China , keep in mind $BABA $HUYA $BILI $IQ $NIO $YY $SINA $BZUN $JD $PDD $WB . I think they are going to be lateral until we have an agreement . Just be careful until we have the deal.

2385 2019-02-10 23:04:52 Des appels d'offres à Las Vegas et des stocks options à liquider en même temps que les personnels.
2386 2019-02-10 23:03:54 You claim to be a business man, right? You understand the difference between variability in sales, seasonality and long term, trends right? If you have one poor day's sales, did you shut down the business? Did you base your January stocks on December sales?
2387 2019-02-10 23:01:06 Lol, if you hold a poker hand, or trade stocks.. It’s not advanced calculus.
2388 2019-02-10 22:59:29 Fund flows into property or stocks will not trouble them. If safe haven flows turned US real rates negative, I can see where that would make restarting QE awkward optically. Wouldn't they just use currency swaps to get dollars overseas as needed? Isn't that what Bernanke did?
2389 2019-02-10 22:55:29 How do people still not know that buying a new car is literally the worst investment you can make. THE. WORST. It’s like buying stocks, but only getting 70% of the stocks you paid for. Smarten up people it’s 2019.
2390 2019-02-10 22:49:08 Time to buy another trillion in tech stocks

My choice of stock: Nike
2392 2019-02-10 22:46:32 Be aware @stockswami only tips stocks that he owns or likes. Before following him into anything it’s worth checking his previous calls, $DTI and $FIG are good examples....
2393 2019-02-10 22:45:39 Need a lot of capital to make dividends worth it, especially if you're re-investing into an IRA, but it's not a bad idea. There's a bunch of stable blue chip stocks with good div yield you can look into as well

IRA / 401k are your best bets though with retirement in mind
2394 2019-02-10 22:45:34 Recession in Europe = more NIRP = more $$ into stocks. 

Almost every scenario is bullish for stocks. 
Except a super spike in the dollar.  #blackswan
2395 2019-02-10 22:42:50 Where can one invest in legitimate stocks for the cannabis market. My TIAA cref does not offer the option.
2396 2019-02-10 22:41:55 As long as they have $27, Bernie will have time for him. That fourth house won’t pay for itself.  

Hope we get to see his taxes someday... so his cult can find out where his money comes from. I’m sure even if it’s Goldman Sachs stocks they’ll find it in their hearts to forgive.
2397 2019-02-10 22:41:28 A real estate investment is generally tangible-you buy land or property that you can actually see. Think about how stocks and bonds work. You invest your money in a company you do not physically own.
2398 2019-02-10 22:41:22 Stocks up? The market had its first down year since the Republican’s Great Recession last year. Unemployment is dropping at a lower rate than it was under Obama, and $0 has been allocated for the wall.
2399 2019-02-10 22:41:12 Wow - am I ever glad I never bought any of that bad Toxic Government weed man.  Stocks going to dive now .... Sell Sell Sell

2404 2019-02-10 22:36:44 Request all Senators and House Representatives to disclose all and any stocks, funds, or personal gains for any industry working to confront climate change... Always follow the money...
2405 2019-02-10 22:35:57 Doc really was a blessing at times. 

He’s not like Bandit, who would definitely empty the coffee stocks in two days tops. 

She’s already over at the coffee machine, sat on the counter waiting for it to brew.
2406 2019-02-10 22:35:52 I can spend gold. Land is the same as cash. Bonds are similar to stocks, so isn't relevant. Bitcoins are currency, same as cash. A lot of legitimate businesses except them -- try buying something in a store or online with a bond or a share of stock.
2407 2019-02-10 22:33:07 No cap, im happy to see another black man makin money. my only question is, what are you doin wit it? Stocks, real estate,  business, tuition..? We gota start putting our money in right places so we can keep the money going and stop lettin ppl gentrify our communities.

2409 2019-02-10 22:32:43 The lower temperatures are a result of global warming. Climate and weather are two completely different animals. Think of it this way. When stocks are in a bear market and you get a large upside rally one day. The overall trend is still down.
2410 2019-02-10 22:31:42 Bein j'ai fait pareil et j'ai une grande partie qui est pas mal (soins visages notamment) en revanche les trucs corps bof bof. Du coup je fini mes stocks et je regarderais via INCI pour savoir si je prends ou pas après !
2411 2019-02-10 22:31:28 I enjoy it and use it. I also use TD Ameritrade bc I mess around with OTC. Robinhood does not hit on OTC or penny stocks.

where is the lie tho
2413 2019-02-10 22:28:55 IRA 100% if you're a patient man, easy to max it out each year for the benefit

Bonds are at good interest rates right now + safe

Stocks are volatile at the moment, but putting money into an ETF like $SPY is moderately safe if you're patient

Trade options if you want to gamble
2414 2019-02-10 22:28:48 it means bugger all when msm give SloMo so much airtime

2417 2019-02-10 22:26:11 Yes but demand for any positive yielding dept is high, 10000 people turn 65 every day so they will divest into something safer specially with stocks feeling the pressure. Stocks I would argue are in more precarious position.

2423 2019-02-10 22:21:58 Stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. represent ownership in real world assets with enforceable legal protections.  Crypto has neither.

2432 2019-02-10 22:08:49 Scott, best expln is ALL spend is "printing" or create, ALL tax is "unprinting" or delete.
"Print money" refers to more $ created than (obsolete) gold stocks, so $ falls rel to gold price.
Today we claim ANY net addition of hi-power gov $$, w no regard to econ situation/needs.

2454 2019-02-10 21:50:45 Capitalism *needs* some inflation. Biz & households need fatter bottom lines, rising incomes.
Deflation = econ collapse, bankruptcies, layoffs.

2473 2019-02-10 21:39:16 YIKES. @yukirei_ganon single-handedly obliterates the Zeldas, taking 19 stocks en route in the JP Ganon v Zelda Crew Battle. The Twitch vod is below, and you can also find it on YouTube.
2474 2019-02-10 21:38:52 Defensive stocks, on the other hand, are relatively stable under most economic conditions, no matter how the market is faring. Stocks that fall in this category rare food, drug, and utility!!
2475 2019-02-10 21:37:33 Yep, again I own stocks too.
2476 2019-02-10 21:36:32 Hey Mike. Thanks for the chart updates. Do you only trade options or common as well on stocks, especially $OSTK? Also, when you play it like this past week on $OSTK is it just day trades or some overnight holds as well?
2477 2019-02-10 21:36:18 Most of the dot com stocks went out of business too.  Won’t argue equities aren’t the best investments, but again a 2 to 4% total is fine.  What gets me is how angry some people are over the mere mention of crypto. If you don’t like it - fine! Make money shorting it.

2481 2019-02-10 21:32:16 #7DaysToDie isnt worth having on console. If a game like ARK can have more than 50 players on a server but this can't is a waste. Then console gets no updates anyway.

2482 2019-02-10 21:31:51 TRANSLATION: "Out-of-touch" meaning one does not receive income from investments, trust funds, stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc. The individual  must actually work two to three jobs to afford a modest rent. Worry about healthcare coverage, insurance premiums, utilities, and food.

2485 2019-02-10 21:29:09 If you look at the disastrous Zim land reform situation, only property ownership stood the test of time, during hyperinflation and during deflation. Those who own property retained steady income & value, than stocks, pensions & cash. I heard people paying R500k bonds with $100.
2486 2019-02-10 21:29:07 more to your point, I researched Cannabis stocks a while back, and it is serving me Cannabis related articles mixed with the regular news. Microtargeting is here!
2487 2019-02-10 21:28:47 Because the views of the sovereign people of Scotland and their interests are paramount. Why should Scotland be prevented from reducing standard VAT below 15% or prevented from protecting its fishing stocks and its fishing industry from foreign trawlers? I could go on and on.
2488 2019-02-10 21:28:47 I beg to differ, Liz Cheney and Trump are the laughing stocks.  Warren has character, intelligence, and morality.  All character traits that seem to be lacking in the GOP.

2490 2019-02-10 21:28:05 Hey middle class family, how are you going to spend your tax break?

Hey mega corporation, how are you going to spend your tax break?
- Buy back stocks (pay off debt)

So who actually gets an increase in money here?
2491 2019-02-10 21:27:54 I'm so glad I received an revvied my markets education with five star stocks. A proper Penny Stock training as I fought kept em offs shorts scalpers an 5 % gainers an the of me all legal eagle. Doesn't mean I wouldn't want a some reconciliation recognition for all helped.
2492 2019-02-10 21:27:12 We have been watching it closely... It's amazing to me that Trump folks should have the yearly reviews. One can easily see the crash, when Obama took over, all he did to save USA, Trump election, stocks strengths and uncertainties. We are definitely uncertainties now..
2493 2019-02-10 21:26:19 Yes they are. Due to many #environmental and human factors. And that's why it is imperative that Somalis do more to cultivate them and replenish depleting stocks.
2494 2019-02-10 21:26:16 The stock market has proven the best long-term investment since 1950.

Most alt-coins and ICOs are already worthless and even the leading crypto (BTC, ETH, XRP) is rapidly headed that way.

Plenty of smart people were involved in 1990’s dot-com stocks and 2000’s real estate also.
2495 2019-02-10 21:24:57 If you buy the right stocks and stay patient you can literally live off the dividend money each company pays quarterly.. make your money work for you! #EdwardWalkerLLC
2496 2019-02-10 21:24:38 Yea and flash hiders and collapsible stocks ect ect
2497 2019-02-10 21:23:58 Actually, there has been many times in history where stocks have fallen over 70% and some sectors 90%.  Remember, #bitcoin started for under $1 only 10 years ago.  Too many smart individuals involved to be a scam, but still 2 to 4% of portfolio max.
2498 2019-02-10 21:21:17 People now have the best of both worlds. While you wait for BTC to rise, use it as collateral to trade stocks, forex, commodities and crypto with @quantfury totally fee free. If you trade your fiat profits too uo your crypto collateral. It’s a win win 
2499 2019-02-10 21:20:49 The whole thing is a scam, that’s what’s wrong with it.  Anyone who bought blue-chip stocks didn’t lose 80-90% of their money last year.
2500 2019-02-10 21:20:35 how do we know Jim is right vs the heavy weights of the sector?  Well, UEC has been at or near 52 week lows for 5 to 6 months when other sector stocks were flying high and still is today, Rule sold his UEC stock, and Marin did not reply back a few weeks ago when I reprinted
2501 2019-02-10 21:20:09 I need to change my circle of friends.

2504 2019-02-10 21:16:27 I’m proud to say that I haven’t sold any stocks in over a year. From my research and talking with successful investors the buy and hold strategy is the way to go. For me it’s a lot harder than it sounds and takes patience.
2505 2019-02-10 21:15:47 If the choice is between laughing stocks and war criminals, I'll take laughing stock.
2506 2019-02-10 21:15:36 Like to keep at least 1kg of the good stuff just in case stocks get low.
2507 2019-02-10 21:13:07 Stocks plunged as Cablevision Systems Corporation unveiled a vulnerable car today.
2508 2019-02-10 21:12:30 Rampant pumped stocks are the new internet security stocks.
2509 2019-02-10 21:12:30 On my list now. Activist shareholders love these consumer stocks, so not implausible
2510 2019-02-10 21:09:44 I wish I got to go figure out what stocks to invest in tomorrow 
2511 2019-02-10 21:07:28 You and me both but I like dropping in hot spots most of my matches, so I either get cucked by a crate that gives me only stocks or I get a wingman/re-45 
2512 2019-02-10 21:06:52 @All32Lee and @All32Shaun were joined by Stocks from @5yardrush for this week's podcast. The episode will drop tomorrow..... If NFL players where chocolate bars what would Aaron Rogers be????
2513 2019-02-10 21:05:57 Well done Caroline! Sorry we didn’t get to have a proper chat at Dairy Tech, but Jo has the photo :)
2514 2019-02-10 21:04:49 Liz and her father DICK, are both laughing stocks,  so who is she to talk.
2515 2019-02-10 21:03:43 The Stocks bring them back please.
2516 2019-02-10 21:03:39 Finish all my Big cap stocks time for OTC stocks 
2517 2019-02-10 21:03:32 2 stocks??
2518 2019-02-10 21:03:09 $SBOT finish all my big cap stock now time for my OTC STOCKS
2519 2019-02-10 21:01:46 A few stocks removed from the ACJ watchlist:  $BEAT $LITE and a few added: $MEDP $NFLX $PRAH $PLNT
2520 2019-02-10 20:58:35 We know it was a mess because:

A) Unemployment was slightly above 4% and still falling

B) The economy was stable and growing

C) Financial institutions were stable and making record profits 

D) Corporate profits and stocks were at highest levels ever

E) Our Military is strong
2521 2019-02-10 20:57:55 Robber barons aren’t making my life better by buying politicians to push agenda that only benefits them. How are they making our lives better by buying back their own stocks instead of investing in R &D, workers & the communities that support them by providing services?
2522 2019-02-10 20:54:59 the roaring 1920s saw a consolidation of wealth towards the top 1%  

ultimately an asset bubble
then stocks crashed 
farmers went bankrupt 
people starved

inequality isnt all that great even for the one percent
2523 2019-02-10 20:54:13 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $CPG, $RMD, $SNE, $VALE, all may climb w/in 15, 10, 9, 9 days up to 8.5%, 4.1%, 2.5%, 4.5% respectively
2524 2019-02-10 20:54:12 Have you played it. Yes it is a beautiful game, but the shooting mechanics is clunky. Game is too time consuming. I think video game stocks getting hit due to smart phones and growing human interaction with apps and entertainment. Also time is precious in a full employment econo
2525 2019-02-10 20:52:53 Ugh. Labor. Other people’s labor is what increases the value of your stocks.
2526 2019-02-10 20:44:47 Today I filed my tax return, purchased life insurance, and checked my stocks. Adulting is very time consuming.
2527 2019-02-10 20:43:37 Wish this was a joke, but 3 chests opened and full of stocks and armor, no guns. Yeah, gotta play another.
2528 2019-02-10 20:43:21 You certainly golf more than any previous president and fast food stocks are up too for that matter.

2529 2019-02-10 20:41:39 If this happened in the United States there'd be scores of dead and wounded from assault rifles equipped with bump stocks from testosterone fueled, buzzed and trigger happy nitwits.
2530 2019-02-10 20:40:57 Not for me. That’s a listed stock, and it doesn’t fit the one setup I’m playing on listed stocks.
2531 2019-02-10 20:37:27 Thanks Moon Man Stocks  for the follow!
2532 2019-02-10 20:36:45 watching pot stocks earnings report this week. looking to open a long position in CGC.
2533 2019-02-10 20:35:25 This question is pointless, however, because there are plenty of vineyards with 400+ y.o. stocks, and there's really no way of telling which one's the oldest. We could point to a few, like Schloss Vollrads, Château de Goulaine or Barone Ricasoli, but there's just no way to tell.
2534 2019-02-10 20:35:15 Interviewer: Where do you see yourself in five years?

Me: A futuristic mirror of some kind? It would, um, tell you which way to part your hair and show you how your stocks are doing. And it recaps yesterday’s soap operas, so you can still participate in water cooler discussions!
2535 2019-02-10 20:33:22 The stocks the stocks then a spell in the tower
2536 2019-02-10 20:32:42 It'll happen and that's when you should buy in. You buy stocks for the long haul not just for a few years and the key is to diversify. But don't listen to me look at all those billionaires you all hate. They got rich by making smart decisions and through hard work.
2537 2019-02-10 20:31:04 That was good?  Okay!  Too me, full blown mockery of the women in the Democrat Party.  Look at how your portrayed?  Laughing stocks of Congress.  Dummies, know nothings.  That’s how you want to be portrayed.  Nice.  Enjoy!
2538 2019-02-10 20:29:03 I'm so sorry you thought that was the case. The panel were there to give written feedback to our shows. Apologise if there was any miscommunication
2539 2019-02-10 20:27:58 I'm not a gun person. Until I play Fallout 4, then I become fucking @animeredneck96 and start giving a shit about rails, attachments, scopes, and stocks.
2540 2019-02-10 20:27:16 pas seulement une question de pouvoir d'achat... une question d'être, sans arrêt, mal  traité et traité comme des chiffres des objets des stocks des stats des choses à manipuler ou à reformater ...
2541 2019-02-10 20:26:27 Me too!
2542 2019-02-10 20:26:18 Dang I can't even do stocks tomorrow because of work :,(
2543 2019-02-10 20:26:05 Public Stocks Bonds and Shares to the FTRA Will be Available in the Next 4 weeks - Will post more soon - The cash raised will be used to pay for Branding and to buy an old Rail Station in California and Vermont
2544 2019-02-10 20:26:00 A guy on a podcast I didn't get his name, that work for Twitter said the reason it stopped displaying the number of members there are is because it has lost membership so fast and the stocks were falling. I believe that.

2549 2019-02-10 20:23:59 I have four kids.  Trust me.. stocks are a much better investment.
2550 2019-02-10 20:22:03 Invest in your children's future, buy stocks of Pearson.
2551 2019-02-10 20:20:43 I want to get more involved in stocks

2553 2019-02-10 20:19:42 6| Next They Can Also Lend It Out For Small Businesses Right ?? But Small Businesses Have To Pay Back Close To Poor Ppl Intrest On That Money they Borrowed From the Banks That Bought There Own Stocks Back. Small Businesses Probably Pay Back 4.5 If Successful In Interest.
2554 2019-02-10 20:18:36 #trade Growth Woes Get in the Way of Emerging-Market Rally: EM Review

(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market stocks halted a six-week rally amid concern over the outlook for U.S.-China trade talks and a global economic slowdown. The reduced appetite for risk also sent currencies down.
2555 2019-02-10 20:18:17 I'm going to move there in the future. Buy a tiny house up on a mountain. Trade stocks. Or live on a boat.
2556 2019-02-10 20:17:25 Of course they don’t match Broke Back Chimpanzee Stocks
That is a totally different company in Illinois 


2557 2019-02-10 20:17:12 5| Now Why is It the Bottom Percents Money That Being Stole & Given To These Rich Banks ?? First Let’s Think. They Borrowed I Hope Or was Given Millions Of Dollars To Buy There Own Stocks, Then Pay Back Us with the Profits From the Stocks They Just Boosted With Our Money ??
2558 2019-02-10 20:17:10 LOL. Now we have exploding deficits, the worst year for stocks since the Great Recession, a Putin asset in the White House, a soaring rate of uninsured and your Campaign Mgr in jail for Conspiracy Against the United States.
2559 2019-02-10 20:15:26 
This is hilarious we have the Broke Back Chimp working overtime for his masters this Sunday afternoon

“BROKE BACK CHIMPANZEE STOCKS”
2560 2019-02-10 20:15:07 Thanks,I was checking Times&Sales and I saw loads of bidders at higher prices so I don't fully understand the slippage. It's happened with more liquids stocks as well (AVGO,JD,BOX,etc) hence I was not fully understanding them at present :S
2561 2019-02-10 20:14:12 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2562 2019-02-10 20:13:26 Believe me, I am the last thing from an expert on the video game stocks, but I recall that SWKS quarter/guidance was bad, yet followed by positive price action and lead the chip stocks higher. Thinking along similar lines here. Market looking 6-12 months ahead..we'll see!
2563 2019-02-10 20:12:51 Bullish: Net stocks, Bearish: Bonds.
2564 2019-02-10 20:10:57 No they won’t. That’s a scare tactic they’ve instilled while begging for tax breaks for jobs and innovation only to buy back stocks & pay bonuses. Where are they going to go? Name a country with more to offer & a better, more material-driven consumer base than the US.
2565 2019-02-10 20:10:05 I don't know if you're being serious or not, but, it is a good idea to line up stocks on that sector.
2566 2019-02-10 20:09:55 I sold everything even my house to buy a ton of Cannabis stocks. I am going to be so fking rich man.

2568 2019-02-10 20:09:28 So what do you think increases the value of your stocks?
2569 2019-02-10 20:08:53 people that have their preferred rules set to 3 stocks 3 minutes w/ the smash ball on in elite smash are the worst kinds of people.

2570 2019-02-10 20:07:29 The anti-gun liberal left isn't concerned about our rights, safety, comfort, or even our lives.

Pistol grips and thumb hole stocks are about ergonomics.
Barrel shrouds are about safety
Adjustable stocks are about comfort.

All they care about is control.
2571 2019-02-10 20:05:13 Ah sorry! Great that they were there, We misunderstood ‘panel’ as to mean a talk from them.
2572 2019-02-10 20:04:01 I didn't realise there was a difference between stocks and a pillory.
2573 2019-02-10 20:03:56 I think there is a store on Temptation Island that stocks only off the shoulder lady blouses.
2574 2019-02-10 20:02:50 It says something different to everyone.  That’s why the most important thing isn’t what I or Mark say.  It’s what the stocks on your watchlist are telling you.  It’s what the market is telling you.  It’s far more knowledgeable than we’ll ever be
2575 2019-02-10 20:02:20 If you play w/ 2 stocks rules you deserve the worst of deaths
2576 2019-02-10 20:02:07 Minimize tax bill by investing heavily in tax-free municipals, tax-sheltered real estate, and stocks with unrealized gains.

2583 2019-02-10 20:00:14 Tip 3: As a beginner, it is advisable to focus on a maximum of one to two stocks during a trading session. With just a few stocks, tracking and finding opportunities is easier.
2584 2019-02-10 19:59:56 Way more liquidity and volatility in FX and stocks (options for leverage) for smaller accounts that make it way easier to apply TA and FA strategies. Trading crypto alone is going to make you very bored or succumb to overtrading. I have $20-$40 ltf strategies and it’s not fun.
2585 2019-02-10 19:58:56 Tax refund?!? BWWAAHHAAHHAAA. But hey, you got your corp tax cut and got to buy back your stocks.
2586 2019-02-10 19:57:10 All members of Congress make money from stocks, books and have family businesses that get government money contracts!!!! How is it that you made your millions of dollars?????#Hypocrites #DoubleStandards
2587 2019-02-10 19:55:38 The #GOPTaxScam helped ONLY the 1%. They didn’t pass it down to higher wages, better benefits for employees nor more jobs. They manipulated stocks in their favor. Over 60% of ppl I know do NOT own stocks & those that do it’s bc they have 401Ks, which is used for their retirement.
2588 2019-02-10 19:55:08 Good stuff. One item I’d like to comment on is $APA... in my view with all the capex being put towards their Alpine High (looking gassier all the time) it should be trading more inline with NG stocks. If that’s the case, there’s room to fall still given the sector compression

2593 2019-02-10 19:49:44 Electronic Arts just reported a kitchen sink quarter. Lousy guidance lousy results and look at the result two days later. I imagine they are the canary in the coal mine for gaming stocks. Would happily buy a gap down.
2594 2019-02-10 19:49:05 @DportJr_92 you a got a dude that handle yo stocks or you do that olo
2595 2019-02-10 19:47:51 Hey #ponzibrothers I got a new crypto doubler HYIP based on day trading cow bean-o stocks. Can ya hook me up?
2596 2019-02-10 19:47:47 Quite so...stocks like this are vanishingly rare but if you recognise them at an early stage they are transformative financial events

I bought #HUR too early but massively increased my position when the world fell out of love with it
#BUR was a great call
2597 2019-02-10 19:47:39 It’s Liz and her dad who are laughing stocks.  Well not exactly laughing, wishing Obama had had Dick investigated.
2598 2019-02-10 19:45:39 The older accounting used to distnguish between 'unearned income' (from stocks etc) and 'earned income' (wages/salaries). Kinda like that version.
2599 2019-02-10 19:45:29 The unrealized losses pic is a stretch. Aurora wasn’t day trading those deals. The “worthless” warrants have years to be capitalized & stocks goes up n down... I think.
2600 2019-02-10 19:45:16 Girl stop it. Obama got us out of a recession. You do remember that right?  The housing market crashed. Stocks were below 8k, millions unemployed. He saved the auto industry. Gave millions healthcare. Girl please.
2601 2019-02-10 19:44:53 @BroCodeClub Bro you're so good yet so hard to find. No stocks anywhere in Kochi!!! 
2602 2019-02-10 19:43:53 No not playing dumd. The last gun ban only effected the cosmetic look of the weapon not the functionality. Bump stocks weren't around during the last gun ban so they would not have been included.
2603 2019-02-10 19:42:33 #fed are buying stock, this is obvious now to prop up markets. They are specifically buying semi conductors which pumped and now buying cloud company stocks to make a case for bulls because Faangs can no longer lead the market. No govt intervention.
2604 2019-02-10 19:42:32 I mean, I support uncontrolled access to full auto. It's time the NRA start pushing for getting our rights back instead of meekly saying "here's our bump stocks please don't do anything else"
2605 2019-02-10 19:42:15 Just Buy all the Big Canadian Cannabis Stocks and get rich man. Lambo soon.
2606 2019-02-10 19:41:45 2/.  QE deprived excess money a place to park when it traded reserves for treasury securities.  So, excess money chased stocks and real estate.  If you don’t like the asset inflation that causes, then you should support taxing away those excess dollars.
2607 2019-02-10 19:38:59 I’m pretty sure it’s an update on the stocks of incendiary grenades
2608 2019-02-10 19:38:28 Thanks! I start targeting those businesses and moving my stocks and 401k's! If you find more, please post!
2609 2019-02-10 19:38:23 I agree with most everything here.  But I alway questioned this notion that a stock is "under" or "over" valued for public stocks.  If there is an arm-length transaction, doesn't that establish the value?  And if it does, then how can one say the stock isn't fairly valued?
2610 2019-02-10 19:37:37 Wont be dealing in #Aim stocks after #Val (& #Afren) as not ruthless, more so #corrupt to the core! When enough catch on... Aim will either a: stop or b: clean up its act! personally I hope it grinds to a halt, to it can be dog eat dog (ie mm eat mm )they deserve each other imo

2615 2019-02-10 19:32:16 I’m so stuck on being successful and reading books my buddy told me to read for advice, we went out to eat & I asked how much was the water I ordered?On a budget to Invest more into my stocks & soon invest in multi-family homes spend money to make money not lose $
2616 2019-02-10 19:31:17 Or maybe he listened to the Liberal party policy platform that said it would be legalized.  Right there, out in the open.  If I had had any sense, I would have bought stocks in those companies leveraging themselves to jump in at the first instance.
2617 2019-02-10 19:29:56 Please advise whether you offer trading of stocks, bonds and equity options in American and Canadian exchanges?
2618 2019-02-10 19:29:52 Anyone who’s good with stocks hmu :) I just started investing and wanna get different opinions
2619 2019-02-10 19:29:48 Bueno, no pude entrar a top8 pero muy contento con el juego, pudiendo ganar alguna partida sin perder stocks y sobre todo encantado de conocer a gente nueva
2620 2019-02-10 19:29:43 Ah, playing dumb. Start with the ones that were previously banned from 1994-2004, when deaths from them went down. When bill is drafted they can detail specifics, but u and we all know theyre commonly called assault weapons, ar-15s. Also large capacity ammo and bump stocks.
2621 2019-02-10 19:29:25 Do you hold stocks in this establishment????
2622 2019-02-10 19:27:03 Enjoy, I like going to the theatre.
2623 2019-02-10 19:26:57 Hope he stocks up on Vaseline!
2624 2019-02-10 19:26:24 @Lazonick Bill Lazonick, can you compute accurately how much stocks increase in value due to stock buybacks?

Then we could (at least) make legislation that compensates for this for the stocks held by the management of a corporation. @BernieSanders @ewarren
2625 2019-02-10 19:25:49 Stocks....
2626 2019-02-10 19:25:46 The Jensen and Dylon Joint co. We do stocks. We also make joints.
2627 2019-02-10 19:25:43 Give me some options to choose from. I honestly don't know much about stocks
2628 2019-02-10 19:25:11 That may have been true before. Before wasn’t based on utility.Utility throws another variable in the mix. I would proceed with caution. Remember that the utility is the movement of money through the internet. Anything tech related grows exponentially faster than stocks.
2629 2019-02-10 19:24:31 They invest in stocks from the group's they get money from. Lobbyists get their laws, politicians get rich.
2630 2019-02-10 19:24:13 Most Americans don’t own stocks.  So this only affects you and your rich cronies.  Explain how tax cuts were supposed to benefit middle class again.  No wonder Paul Ryan ducked out before the shit hit the fan
2631 2019-02-10 19:23:22 ‘Countenance’ currently the most over used in-word by politicians and commentators. ‘Minded’, was another trendy politico-word. However, any suit wearing dolt that uses the words bunkum or poppycock in 2019 needs to be put in the stocks and pelted with horse manure. STOP IT!
2632 2019-02-10 19:23:17 Except they work to keep wages low. Look at stocks rising with firings.
2633 2019-02-10 19:21:21 You’ve assumed that the current extreme excesses of income go to business investment. Evidence has show that it typically doesn’t, but usually gets saved or invested in stocks, or on the corporate side gets put into stock buybacks.
2634 2019-02-10 19:20:51 Además los stocks de hoy se planificaron hace 10/12 meses, pensando en otro volumen de venta. Hoy hay un combo de mayor inventario (x estimar una economía más arriba) y menos venta que hace un año
2635 2019-02-10 19:19:36 most remainers think sky going fall in,medicine stocks run low, think they haven’t gathered govt would also be breaking some human right laws also not Allowing/restricted  trade.Think they need to look those laws up also.Shows some of their mentality ,theirs lot more involved
2636 2019-02-10 19:19:35 Cause Them New Stocks Are The Way To Go Now And Days On The Silverado, Or Escalade Stocks
2637 2019-02-10 19:16:08 my 16 year old brother is building a computer from dcratch and making literal thousands from investing in stocks why am I so inferior LOL

2639 2019-02-10 19:13:53 Just shared a Google doc link in Telegram where i mention data for stocks that i usually trade for intraday. Any News / Result etc i find or my group member finds will be added there
2640 2019-02-10 19:13:37 I don’t like this slide so much. Because it doen’t say that without oil, the world’s entire food system would collapse instantly, and food stocks are actually counted in days, not in months.

In 3 weeks, the entire world would be starving to death.

So forget aerosols.
2641 2019-02-10 19:13:35 apple stocks rise by 10%.
2642 2019-02-10 19:13:30 I feel your posts like this which are linking to news articles talking bad about Michael are causing more damage than help. Just a humble advice.. Abuse them or target them without giving these links. Ur tweets with reference to these articles are helping these stocks get noticed
2643 2019-02-10 19:11:55 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2644 2019-02-10 19:10:26 How about air travel?
Or smoking one cigarette?
Or eating one hamburger?
Or trading stocks at a desk?

All deadlier than working at a nuclear power plant.
2645 2019-02-10 19:10:24 Ça craint j’espère vraiment qu’ils vont refaire les stocks
2646 2019-02-10 19:10:05 I wonder how many GXU insiders are gobbbling up stocks GXU has devalued!
2647 2019-02-10 19:08:54 Trap er niet in mensen... fancy word .. Maybe the promoters have some stocks? 
Best security is to secure it yourself.
2648 2019-02-10 19:08:35 Quelqu’un a un code promo sur stocks qui marche actuellement ?
2649 2019-02-10 19:07:51 Hahaha, he’s a money launderer. Lying about stocks is just a byproduct
2650 2019-02-10 19:07:02 Wish I would have got in to trading stocks on the #NYSE when I first start driving trucks
2651 2019-02-10 19:06:53 @donthrilla what do you see for the long term investment in pot stocks?
2652 2019-02-10 19:06:52 1. Spx opex this week which is bullish for stocks=downside risk for should be muted.

2. nat gas should start consolidating and rising this week. Although there is downside risk under $2.55 bottom should be in and upturn  should begin...
2653 2019-02-10 19:05:56 I’m in the office researching stocks, crypto, and building a company for long term financial growth... concurrently the wife is on the couch finding all means/methods to spend money.

solution: funnel all funds into illiquid altcoin(s).... $BIS
2654 2019-02-10 19:03:52 "quants had found evidence that over 200 years 'low-risk' #stocks tended to outperform in the strategy widely known as “betting against beta.” As much of modern finance is based on the assumption that higher returns reward higher risks, this is a major and important anomaly."
2655 2019-02-10 19:03:51 Oh really? So your ignoring that xrp is used for dex, micropayments, remittance, gaming, retail, entertainment and web monetization, issuing stocks and assets like metal on the blockchain, capital calls, provenance, identity, etc Lol
2656 2019-02-10 19:02:59 I totally agree. Discussion point tho: a tokenized security is still a security, and subject to capital gains/losses. I'm thinking/looking forward to being able to be paid in stocks or crypto rather than fiat since that is simpler from a tax view.
2657 2019-02-10 19:02:49 Seeing so many 'pro' traders saying this week is pivotal for the market for XYZ reason. Where were they in early January? That's when it was time to put chips on the table, which I did. Now I can sit back & let others jam my stocks higher. You have to anticipate weeks in advance
2658 2019-02-10 19:02:37  mav dropping boys draft stocks
2659 2019-02-10 19:02:18 And knowing that govt would have my soc sec spent before I will ever see it I have invested and worked hard and keep socking some away and buying stocks. Wall Street  and capitalism .
2660 2019-02-10 19:02:07 Fat Tony would not let you get away with this mere prediction

Which stocks are you short & for how much?
2661 2019-02-10 19:01:20 So if you weren't living on hamberders, you might live to be 200? Smh. Please stop turning our institutions into laughing stocks. Thanks.
2662 2019-02-10 19:00:34 When stocks are tokenized, I may be able to buy my Starbucks Frappuccino with fractions of @Starbucks stock.

How amazing is that?

2663 2019-02-10 19:00:16 Long Side Watchlist - UPL, JD.
Expecting a bloodbath in small/midcaps this week if buyers don't step up aggressively at lower levels, charts are not looking good for most of the stocks.
2664 2019-02-10 18:59:22 $hip one of the top 4% worst preforming cannabis stocks lol from 3.30 to .40 cents in a year, with absolutely no spikes or run ups, this junk stock is screaming for a total buyout, @newstrikeltd please just sell yourselves, your stagnant stock is failing
2665 2019-02-10 18:58:32 When are we going to start putting people back in the stocks and throwing tomatoes at them?
2666 2019-02-10 18:57:55 Alternate Headline: "Millenials Buy all of the stocks that I wouldn't touch with a barge pole"!
2667 2019-02-10 18:56:57 The other fact is: before you “took over as President,” people legally owned bump stocks prior to you making them banned. Now they have until March 21st, to turn them in before you make them felons due to your confiscation agenda! Good going Mr. President.
2668 2019-02-10 18:55:27 Lots of penny stocks out there: MCOA, POTN & HEMP just to name a few. Are these stocks have potential or just a $1 and a dream stock that most likely not to materialize? Thoughts?
2669 2019-02-10 18:54:40 Those industrial chemicals were brought to you by American corporations. Many of whom were my vendors who moved to Mexico for cheap labor. I'll refrain from naming names. Just take a look at some blue chip stocks. Don't forget the scotch tape either.
2670 2019-02-10 18:54:25 Ce type de grenade (défensive, 25g de TNT)est utilisé uniquement en France....elle est remise en question mais la gendarmerie attend l'épuisement des stocks (prévu en 2021) avant d'arrêter d'en commander....
2671 2019-02-10 18:54:12 If you don't have kids, have stocks.

Both are investments. Neither offer any guarantees.

But you'll need something/someone to take care of you in the latter part of your life.
2672 2019-02-10 18:53:55 Ultimate Online would be so much better if the match making actually gave you the Ruleset you wanted. Nintendo, if I have 3 stock 7 minutes selected, I DO NOT want 2 minute no stocks items on.
2673 2019-02-10 18:52:02 Nobody cares dude. Just Buy  Cannabis Stocks and get rich man. Lambo soon.
2674 2019-02-10 18:51:49 Its high time every single politician needs to have their tax returns, investments / stocks & all donations transparently clear, no exceptions.
2675 2019-02-10 18:50:57 Starting a newsletter soon to teach people how to invest (not day trade) in penny stocks for the purpose of getting silicon valley type multiples.

I've consulted to over 300 smallcap companies, which provides me with unparalleled knowledge.

Affiliate program too. 

Let's talk?
2676 2019-02-10 18:49:06 The food festival in Cardiff bay but there is a shop in penarth that stocks them on the main shopping road..great foot rests....the also do pigs..
2677 2019-02-10 18:48:29 About that, Apex Legends skyrocketed their stocks and it's higher now than it was before it dropped.
2678 2019-02-10 18:48:27 Answer to the question.. ALL have an 80%+ probability of gaining more than 20% this week! Earnings explains why many are on the list, but not all. I am NOT advocating you buy these stocks! Let's keep track to see how this pans out based on seasonality!
2679 2019-02-10 18:47:36 I hope my family stocks me up on LSU stuff for my birthday
2680 2019-02-10 18:47:17 People are going to have to start using #ETFs because like it or not #regulation is coming and if we think we can get through another year with 96% of us not payinany taxes then we have another thing coming. harm Getting your feet wet plus+:

•Taxes automatic
• $stocks
2681 2019-02-10 18:46:25 Stocks are way overvalued and not worth it imo
2682 2019-02-10 18:45:23 Insurance stocks, which will be the biggest Tax Cut rollout today. Republicans! Every on-line from Wikileakes, really nice if the Fake News is now calling President Obama for first time in Nice, France. Was Obama too soft on crime and drugs!
2683 2019-02-10 18:45:10 Who's gonna complain if they get $15 million in stocks ffs. Currency being transmutable into other forms is its DEFINING characteristic
2684 2019-02-10 18:42:45 Any clue, how and where we can invest in uranium stocks in India?
2685 2019-02-10 18:41:36 $nbev is set for a great week. Four of the large CBD stocks are announcing earnings which should guide the future potential of the US market. What you see in Canada is just the beginning and small projection of future sales.
2686 2019-02-10 18:40:54 Dude, no panel and no explanation?! A bit shit.

2688 2019-02-10 18:40:06 Tip 93: It is always better to buy the stocks of the company that has met with good financial gains or has announced good news.
2689 2019-02-10 18:40:00 You can look up my history that I made posts in twitter about stocks hit bottom then bounce up. Also, I always say I bought stock when I like in twitter. I will make an announcement what I buy stock but never make an announcement when I sell. You make your own decision to sell
2690 2019-02-10 18:39:24 Wow. Please understand the difference between wealth and income. Rich people are worth billions through the value of their assets (stocks, real estate, etc.), they dont get it cash through income. Tons of tech billionaires out there have businesses that loose money. Read a book!
2691 2019-02-10 18:38:29 I think a more effective plan would be taxing Investment & Interest the same as Wages & Tips. Billionaires make most of their money on stocks... Why are they taxed at a lower rate than working??
2692 2019-02-10 18:38:11 هل تتوقع يرتفع ام يهبط
2693 2019-02-10 18:37:35 Steak umm stocks rise 200%
2694 2019-02-10 18:36:24 Purchasing stocks (recommended on various plateforms) is overrated, buying underlying values or businesses is underrated.
Sir @dmuthuk , pls comment.
2695 2019-02-10 18:35:34 The recovery happened long before lowering the corporate tax rate, and stocks were flat for 2018, so it would seem you're kind of talking out of your ass here.
2696 2019-02-10 18:34:51 WOW $LFAP!! OTC stocks are flyin' this season!!  $NNRX $VYST just wow!! Big hype in these this weekend... $COTE $ETEK $QBAN Less hype but nice action going on in $ALST $GGSM $UBQU $HIPH Good luck traders!! Don't forget to take profits but don't be a HOG!!! 
2697 2019-02-10 18:34:08 Yeah that’s all I’m saying but easy to trigger the US MJ camp that thinks I’m saying there’s no growth there or anything. Never said that. 2015 most of cad mj were penny stocks, US will never start with such low market caps due to higher awareness/interest
2698 2019-02-10 18:32:41 It should be a club learning about how stocks operate and investing in them. Someone please put it together or let me know if it’s something out there already #NCAT
2699 2019-02-10 18:32:07 That jamaican boy that stocks dry goods.  *bites lip* he had the good good stuff.

2702 2019-02-10 18:26:14 fuck stocks!!! i dont wanna think about it!!
2703 2019-02-10 18:25:49 I like the Tesla product. Not pushing any stocks. All the worlds automakers are stressed financially now as they invest heavily to transition to less profitable EV future.
2704 2019-02-10 18:25:00 I saw this graph in a presentation by DFO in 2018, for the life of me I can't find it again.  Anyway, shows the capelin stocks as stable until sometime in the past few years when the seismic activity started up again and next year the stock nose dived.  It just seems so obvious.
2705 2019-02-10 18:21:44 Yes.  And if there won’t be a Plaza Accord 2, the milkshake is dead.  The US Trilemma will hold (2 of 3 if rates, stocks or USD up).  4q18 was likely just a warmup.
2706 2019-02-10 18:20:30 Dan ,Nflx,Amzn,Nvda,etc.Why you call them Beta stocks?

2708 2019-02-10 18:17:36 Oh, another one! Pudding got a lot! Maybe this stocks was enough for a year.
2709 2019-02-10 18:17:07 You purchase investments that appreciate over time (homes, stocks) & rent/lease those that depreciate (cars). 

When you rent you: 
1. Have no ability to participate in appreciation 
2. No tax benefits 
3. Rent/mo. can 

Even with expenses, you’re WAY ahead in just 2-3 years.
2710 2019-02-10 18:16:25 Almost like Irish stew. Do you hunt your own Irish or is there a store that stocks it fresh?
2711 2019-02-10 18:15:49 A la de R #Fraisse avait été évoqué (M Intérieur) d'arrêter l'utilisation de ces #grenades par les forces de l'ordre (seule la  les utilise: l'#UE)
La gendarmerie a annoncé le faire à l'épuisement des stocks prévu en 2021
Ben oui on n'va pas gâcher le matériel #GilestJaunes
2712 2019-02-10 18:14:43 #55YearsVs55Months

Yeah 

For 55 years Indian PMs were respected all over the word.  

Within 55 months Indian PM becomes laughing stocks all over the world
2713 2019-02-10 18:14:36 No.
Democrats are pushing for mandatory background check - at gun stories, gun shows, etc.
Dems were pushing for outlawing bump stocks.
Dems are pushing for more discretion about WHO should own guns.
Dems r pushing for guns meant for war to not be in the general population...

2714 2019-02-10 18:13:33 Trump and your father are laughing stocks the world over for numerous gaffes and lies. Warren made one mistake. Get over it!
2715 2019-02-10 18:12:36 Bullish: Biology technology stocks, Bearish: Defensives.
2716 2019-02-10 18:12:04 IM USING THIS MONEH ON STOCKS AND FLIGHTS... and hangover drinks for tomorrow 
2717 2019-02-10 18:10:54 I know with trading stocks you can make more but man..
2718 2019-02-10 18:09:54 This man said he saved close to 150k and said he going to start trading stocks.. and trust me his job wasn’t stressful or hard.
2719 2019-02-10 18:09:06 theres roth 401ks which i have, but our HR person said its really better to diversify and have both a regular 401k and a roth ira? and also do stocks?? but fuck all that it's too much work
2720 2019-02-10 18:08:52 I own several REITS for income. Partnerships also have tax advantages. And of course the capital gain. The favorite of rich people. Also tax advantaged. That’s why you need to own stocks.
2721 2019-02-10 18:06:38 Lmfao that shows how stupid you are. Only idiots who play FOMO stocks get burned and never learn to only play the charts. That's why you are a broke fuck  you are my new Twitter bitch bwahhahaha Tell your mom no child support for you this month my bastard child.
2722 2019-02-10 18:06:16 No doubt gives a lot of quick practice with rapid bull/bear markets compared to regular stocks
2723 2019-02-10 18:05:52 Speaking of laughing stocks, Liz, how’s your dad?
2724 2019-02-10 18:05:45 But to list on anything other than low tier OTC exchange for good liquidity in US will require more regulations to come in first, institutions won’t pump OTC stocks they can’t touch
2725 2019-02-10 18:05:24 This sector has taught me so many lessons in a very short time. Been investing in stocks a little over a year. But with MJ it's like going through 2 or 3 cycles. Love it and hope it all works out. GLTA!
2726 2019-02-10 18:05:06 this group fiber optics stengthening with quite a few emerging stocks. $GLW $IPHI $ACIA $FNSR
2727 2019-02-10 18:05:03 That’s rich considering who her father is. Talk about laughing stocks. And evil as well. The apple doesn’t fall far.
2728 2019-02-10 18:05:00 Somehow we had to include the florist, police and ambulance! 
2729 2019-02-10 18:04:52 Dear friend, if you hadn't told that Albert David was a #pharma Co. & then your comment would read as:

2730 2019-02-10 18:04:44 There should be a few smaller multibaggers and could be a 10 bagger or two in next Few years but nothing like cad mj which all started as penny stocks giving insane gains
2731 2019-02-10 18:04:33 Only amateurs focus on RSI which represents the close ONLY!
Especially in February where stocks run for weeks while RSI 94+

Dude I’ll make your bitch ass cry like the cunt you are so keep it up and I’ll keep bitch slapping you all damn day in front of your 5 followers
2732 2019-02-10 18:04:22 I will be on @Benzinga tomorrow (Monday) am with @SJisrael and Joel Elconin on #PreMarketPrep to talk about joining the Advisory board of Veteran Owned and Operated investment Bank @DrexelHamilton and talk  #stocks and #Markets and #Investing at 8:35am EST / 5:35am PST. Tune in!
2733 2019-02-10 18:03:10 I hate how we so often just through random stocks with no correlation together and call it abstract. Abstract doesn’t have to mean random. I personally prefer a design that feels like it’s in unison/harmony with all the assets within.
2734 2019-02-10 18:01:41 And what more did we get for it? Raises? No. More jobs? No. More separation from middle class and the 1%? Yes!!! Companies getting richer by selling off stocks?? Yes!!!
2735 2019-02-10 18:01:38 @Twist1285 so true.. so true well stocks like this I buy low and let it run long really long cause next threat of war this will be in $500.
2736 2019-02-10 18:01:10 A little wine and global stocks, what could go wrong?
2737 2019-02-10 18:00:18 We follow #cannabis #stocks which trade on the #TSX, #TSXv and the #CSE - $GTEC, $TGIF, $GABY, $MMJ, $PYX, $OGI, $WEED, $PUF, $NGW, $HUGE
2738 2019-02-10 18:00:05 does networth include stocks
2739 2019-02-10 17:59:49 So basically, it's completely legal for someone's campaign to be funded by a huge corporate industry, push legislation to benefit that industry once in office, and make yourself rich by helping industries you own stocks in. And there's no oversight to stop it. Got it.
2740 2019-02-10 17:59:31 I was told that those who own billions in finance are sworn to secrecy and keep it away from everyone else! It’s time to lift up the curtain and expose them! Starting with trading stocks! Warren Buffett here we come!
2741 2019-02-10 17:56:21 USA Stock Market continues to rally even though world economic conditions are declining.  USA stocks are 7% below their all time high.  Foreign country's stocks are considerably lower... China is down 25%, Europe is down 18%.   USA investors are hoping for lower interest rates.
2742 2019-02-10 17:55:32 Can @billmaher produce his tax returns, private plane, and non America residencies? Also, all the infamous 1% rich. Twitter as usual will do their thing. Tax rich?..rich have their money and rich lawyers dodge taxes. E.G. off shore accounts, stocks with tax incentives, etc..go$$
2743 2019-02-10 17:55:19 Trump juiced up the economy with the Tax Scam which has lead to more  Stock Market gains as companies buy back their own stocks. In the mean time Trump is cutting regulations back to pre-Bush Great Recession days which may end up bringing on the Great Trump Recession.

2746 2019-02-10 17:54:24 Not gonna lie, I’m raging. But stocks must be counted!
2747 2019-02-10 17:53:05 Move assets from stocks and bonds into silver or gold . How are you going to tax that as not showing up on your computer statements sent by the banks to gov . Then your credit market freeze up , 401k accounts will go down . You never able to get the rich a Dem pipe dream .
2748 2019-02-10 17:53:01 The same reasoning stated that making bump-stocks illegal is really an attempt to take away the 2nd Amendment.
2749 2019-02-10 17:52:19 GDP and stocks are not a true measurement of how a country is doing. The average American’s health, and the ability to pay for education & save money for retirement, is a better indicator of a Country’s wellbeing. Most Americans don’t own much stock. The 1% owns us.

2751 2019-02-10 17:51:32 @jimcramer been in @nokia since 2011 - one of first stocks owned and got emotionally attached - could you see this going to $10 in a few years?  Thank you!
2752 2019-02-10 17:51:07 Short stocks, long vol. I won't recommend any particular vehicles on here, but I do on @GuruHavenHQ.
2753 2019-02-10 17:50:10 I'm really surprised there isn't more of an outcry regarding seismic testing. I'm no scientist but when you look at periods of a seismic activity in the ocean right back to WW2, then look at cod stocks just a few years later in each case - seems like there's a correlation.
2754 2019-02-10 17:50:00 Feb is the time for Earnings Releases on my #stocks portfolio. 
Super exited to see how it turns out!
After 5 months of clean-up, I managed to build a portfolio I'm really confident about and has most definitely outperformed the S&P500 ever since 
2755 2019-02-10 17:47:26 He’s still the chairman of the firm but not actively picking stocks. 

Also interesting how much quieter investors in hedge fund space can be compared to venture
2756 2019-02-10 17:46:45 Stinky,  Imaginre your Medicare account if your payroll deductions had been deposited in your individual account 1/2 bonds, 1/2 stocks to be used for healthcare once over 65y/o.  You could pay cash for direct physician care and purchase catastrophic insurance. Ken
2757 2019-02-10 17:41:34 2) Do u not agree the Fed are likely to cut rates the closer the ISM data approaches 50, and if stocks go back to retest bottoms?

2759 2019-02-10 17:38:15 Was asking same Q. Another soothsayer on the trash heap. Glad I didn't short my Mueller stocks.
2760 2019-02-10 17:37:27 Fair enough but I'd think Buffett doesn't look at it just on book value. Assuming he places a constant value on the stocks, which seems reasonable to me, retained earnings and profit growth in non-ins would lead to a gain in IV.
2761 2019-02-10 17:37:09 No, like seriously, you don't have a f***ing clue how stocks work and if anybody trusts your advice, they're dumb.
There's subtleties to things that are beyond you, like how conversations and investments, and stocks work.
I see attention really excites you, but find it elsewhere.
2762 2019-02-10 17:36:57 2.5hrs left - should be ok to leave at proper time today. Sweets don't fill you up  Gonna have a proper dinner when I get home, and make proper food for the week tmrw. Made space in the freezer for pots. Can't remember half of my snow stocks I brought. Will have a shufty later

2765 2019-02-10 17:34:46 It’s like coffee, I try to limit my intake of individual stocks and stick with an index fund but it’s a hard habit to kick.
2766 2019-02-10 17:34:04 Major Indian stocks like Reliance Industries, TCS, Bajaj Fin, HDFC Bank, and few more at the top of a major bear market. The monthly charts are clear. The parabola has broken and a lot of stocks have already started falling. I expect a major economic downturn.
2767 2019-02-10 17:32:58 In times past they might have been dragged from their homes, put to the guillotine, burnt at the stake, put in stocks etc. So in some ways, a peaceful protest is not really that much to get one's knickers in a twist about.
2768 2019-02-10 17:32:32 This new diet makes me more isolated. I don’t have to go out to buy food anymore, I’ve already got stocks in my room.
2769 2019-02-10 17:32:29 Interesting to see which stocks tanked and recovered last time and which stocks Trump and his associates buy up this time.
2770 2019-02-10 17:32:18 Your job as an investor is to make educated guesses and not blind ones. Your job is to pick stocks and not pay too much for them, then to keep watching for good news or bad news coming out of the companies you own. You can use your knowledge to keep the risks to a minimum.

2771 2019-02-10 17:32:11 Lower priced & thinly traded stocks normally have higher bid-ask spread esp. near the open. If trading them but unable to watch intra-day, relying on stop losses, size them appropriately to minimize risk to portfolio. Another option is to avoid them & trade more liquid names.
2772 2019-02-10 17:31:29 Hmu if you want free stocks!
2773 2019-02-10 17:30:13 Dear @NSEIndia As we already have, #NiftyMidcap and #NiftySmalcap Kindly introduce #NiftyMicrocap It would be much needed soon as most of the mid/small stocks would land up being micro

2781 2019-02-10 17:24:02 Personally I wouldn’t take them back as they are still in date. However I would mention it to GP as if they expire then you will be asking for more, possibly earlier than they would expect. Got me thinking though - I’m away to check my sons stocks.

2784 2019-02-10 17:22:28 In general, I am bearish on FANGMAN stocks. All over-valued.

Highly correlated to the $SPX & $NDX.  If $SPX retraces another 15% from here, they're all going to follow.

Swing trading in and out short-term would be fine

I will cover some more stock related info going forward.

2796 2019-02-10 17:14:13 Crazy, because you can buy and sell stocks for free, right? Oh wait, I didn’t think so.
2797 2019-02-10 17:13:47 You are always so generous to share your insights. Would be grateful on any observations you have on FANG stocks. I tend to trade them a lot lately with uneven success. #alwayslearning

2802 2019-02-10 17:11:59 Yes.  I have 401K and IRA roll-over accounts which I only have long term stocks and ETF holdings with covered calls as hedges. 

For swing trading I have different accounts for futures & options and stocks/options.
2803 2019-02-10 17:11:38 stocks slid as investors grew anxious that the Trump administration won't reach a trade deal with China before a March deadline for escalating the war. Treasuries surged.
2804 2019-02-10 17:11:35 Average investors should not own individual stocks but ETFs that mirror broad averages like SPY, VT, ACWI so on. Leave individual stocks to hedge funders & other professional investors.

2815 2019-02-10 17:01:54 Take a look at the high end, competition target rifles. Bolt actions, so they aren't even firing semi-auto, but many of them have thumbhole stocks with the same angle on the grip, as a pistol grip stock.  There are some firing positions where that angle is easier on your wrist.

2818 2019-02-10 17:01:17 After the experience in @AirCanada flights, I would never invest in their stocks.

2823 2019-02-10 16:58:24 Many people invest in DIVIDEND STOCKS to take advantage of the STEADY INCOME and the opportunity to reinvest the dividends to purchase additional shares of stock. This is a truly passive investment that generates consistent cash flow. Talk to your financial advisor @SXMUrbanView

2826 2019-02-10 16:57:23 Mostly people don't care about it. 
I think the common mind set is - investing is for those who already have some bigger money and -  invest in stocks - it's safe. Well that's what I was thinking over the last years. Until I started to research. Just wondering why not earlier..
2827 2019-02-10 16:56:12 To earn money consistently in any profession, time and experience are indispensable. Many people seam to think trading stocks is different, that you get a pass on that requirement.

2842 2019-02-10 16:42:28 Wow, with your super power to predict the future, do you have any suggestions on which stocks I should invest in? Maybe you can prognosticate how much I’ll be worth in a year? Or maybe how much you will be worth in a year? 

Maybe you can predict which prison Trump will be in?
2843 2019-02-10 16:42:08 If even in such a small cap and midcap carnage, a particular stock is going up...then there must be something special going on there. Definitely worth a closer look and deeper investigation...eg Praj Industries. It's better to  always stay with the stocks favoured by the market
2844 2019-02-10 16:41:36 Friends, I request you to watch videos again and try to solve your queries yourself. If anything not covered as concept, post it here.

I cannot answer queries related to individual stocks.

Pardon me for not answering any future query which I feel is answered or improper method.

2846 2019-02-10 16:39:27 The real national emergency involves mentally ill white men getting assault weapons with bump stocks and shooting up people! A fucking wall ain't gonna solve that problem. You know what would? COMMON SENSE GUN LAWS AND BANNING ASSAULT WEAPONS AND BACKGROUND CHECKS!
2847 2019-02-10 16:38:17 According to the "assault weapon" bills that Feinstein has been pushing for about 14 years, the wood stock rifle is not an "assault rifle", but the rest of them are "assault rifles", because they have synthetic stocks.
2848 2019-02-10 16:35:30 So what actually happens other than the price stocks drop?
2849 2019-02-10 16:35:19 I'll go with that. Stocks & pillory with rotten eggs & tomatoes for kids. A good birching for adults.

2862 2019-02-10 16:27:22 Take Elon musk for example. He doesn't hoard earnings and reinvests it into new ideas. The schematics of Tesla vehicles are open to the public. However, most others are only purchasing stocks back to raise the price and increase CEO wealth. That doesn't create innovation. 2/
2863 2019-02-10 16:26:43 My point is they are already trading at multiple billion market caps, anyone saying it’s  like buying CAD MJ back in the day is kidding themselves, all US MJ stocks debuted at much higher valuations because there is way more awareness and hype built into the sector now

2869 2019-02-10 16:22:36 What goes up, comes down and vice versa. It's not a one way street. One needs to have faith and conviction if you are invested in quality stocks. Accumulate when prices of blue chips are down and these stocks are out of favor. One can't go wrong

2872 2019-02-10 16:19:02 An INCOME INVESTOR is a person who tries to generate a steady income out of the dividends and/or recurring profits of their investments. That could be ongoing rent from a real estate investment, dividend stocks, fixed-income bonds and more! Tune to @SXMUrbanView to learn more!
2873 2019-02-10 16:18:56 The truth is that the middle class taxpayer getting a $4000 tax cut would see the difference immediately while millionaires and billionaires getting tax cuts is just more money to buy more stocks or put in bank accounts.  The wealthy DID NOT NEED a tax cut, working people do!
2874 2019-02-10 16:18:30 The stocks sound miserable in February.
2875 2019-02-10 16:18:17 Still works on a good bunch of stocks
It's what the stock did prior to the placing... if there was a large spike then it is worth sticking the short in on the placing wind(they always leak in one form or another) and ride it down. (If you can get the short position that is)
2876 2019-02-10 16:17:38 The only cogent argument to have no bullet train infrastructure in a country is the desire of being 50 years behind in technology. And, of course, holding oil companies stocks.

What are the best cannabis stocks to invest in 2019?  Can't seem to get anyone to give me any advice that has experience in stocks.  I have very little knowledge, but have owned stocks, and did very well.  I have all of my stock picks on a "watch alert" daily.
2888 2019-02-10 16:08:27 changes in asset prices--especially FX, equities and housing, and increasingly LESS responsive to rate levels. Zombies never die, so recovery is muted. QE continues to keep sovereigns from default, but this will slowly destroy their financial stocks.  Buy BONDS, sell BANKS.

2893 2019-02-10 16:03:59 He also has pretty much any player would want. Safe attacks in neutral, combos that do good damage, decent recovery, reflector, a projectile that's really good, dumb strong smash attacks, and kill moves/combos so he doesnt struggle taking stocks
2894 2019-02-10 16:03:44 Right , so while recommending stocks anywhere people should disclose their buying & selling prices

2942 2019-02-10 15:32:18 He maybe have lost 1B from his personal businesses, but the kickers he’ll get from stocks he owns will make up for that really quick. He’s a business man, he wouldn’t put himself into a position to “lose money”
2943 2019-02-10 15:30:58 Also they dont allow trading and shorting for all the stocks maybe to prevent something like this from happening
2944 2019-02-10 15:29:41 Schumer and Sanders want to control how and under what circumstances companies can buy back their own stocks.  This amounts to a government take-over of industry of the worst kind.  Anyone who thinks this is a good idea is totally ignorant of economics.
2945 2019-02-10 15:28:28 You can write laws and buy stocks that are directly linked to those laws would be a good place to start.

2956 2019-02-10 15:19:30 At this point I just assume whenever politicians push an agenda down our throats they must have some relation or investment into the stocks of said companies involved. None of you do anything unless it goes in to your pockets

2977 2019-02-10 15:04:29 Market speculation and sentiment affects more stocks than real #property. As for land reform, it remains to seen what impact it's going to have on property markets. Valuations are more a function of demand and supply than anything else.

2990 2019-02-10 14:52:33 To me, the post could describe a stock picker succeeding once and believing they have a talent for picking stocks. Or a successful entrepreneur who had a 8 figure exist assuming their next company will do the same.
2991 2019-02-10 14:50:39 Absolutely. Building up stocks and pre positioning of hardware is critical for EU defense. Couldn’t agree more.
2992 2019-02-10 14:49:01 I see many investors have turned traders. Such is the flow of wind. By the time stocks do well my take is the same guys will go back quoting Buffett and munger and what have we. Right now it's no moats, nifty momentum and just selling whatever doesn't go up, buying what does
2993 2019-02-10 14:48:48 It’s going great. Highest GDP in the world, lowest unemployment, stocks are soaring and Europe / China’s production is down as much as 25%. It’s similar to the US’s circa 2009/10.

3002 2019-02-10 14:38:50 We buy from all over the world so it's not such a simple matter. Novo making sure stocks are adequate to allow for any short term disruption is good business and it's not a cost to the company.

3004 2019-02-10 14:38:36 If u have children u sre correct. If u claim8ng u csn make thousands more before being taxed, u are wrong. That doesn't go for people who get W2 or 1099. However if your income is off dividends & stocks u win. However most jobs & pensions dont pay in those.

With the new laws as of last oct for the US, you can almost guarantee fines and possible barring from dealing with securities. Means if your US, shell stocks are better than crypto
3009 2019-02-10 14:32:18 Hoping for some replies. On the five asset classes of  #stocks, #bonds, #cash, #realestate and #commodities ... no questions about the first four.  Do you have commodities in your #portfolio?  How do you #invest in them (#tickersymbol)?  How much of your net worth?

3017 2019-02-10 14:23:24 We spent many years abroad, we have better concept of freedom. Backward locals try undue interfering into other's privacy. People should catch up this illegal devils, and punish them. There is no fun in these hideout laughing stocks.

For a limited time only I am selling my homemade Lung Butter. Entirely organic. Mostly produced with laughter, some coughing may be involved in the process.

Hurry while stocks last.

3019 2019-02-10 14:20:38 Yes!! I hardly ate it at home....and I swear since being abroad it's once a month (luckily our store stocks it here)
3020 2019-02-10 14:20:04 Using A/D to judge strength is as silly as saying stocks are strong bcs of EPS meets/beats juiced in fake ways. Apple met a lowered EPS and also had lower rev/guidance but inv called it strong when it took $12B in buybacks to get there along with the lower tax rate.
3021 2019-02-10 14:18:23 just invest ur money into big stocks is dumb.
3022 2019-02-10 14:16:12 I am asked the Impact of elections on stock markets?

Impact of elections in individual businesses=NIL!

We own businesses and not stocks!

Problem solved!
3023 2019-02-10 14:14:50 Big question to me is do the long stocks drag the indexes higher or the short stocks drag it lower or do we battle back & forth & chop. Not clear which side wins here.
3024 2019-02-10 14:14:32 Even mining stocks?

3029 2019-02-10 14:09:53 I put $1,000 into fixing my 20 year old Maytag washing machine. My repair man told me it was a wise decision, he fixes many 40 yrs old. If you need a part a machinist can make one, or there's a company called Jardin that stocks old appliance parts.
3030 2019-02-10 14:09:47 Buy one ETF = buy multiple stocks. Less narrowing of leadership ensues.
3031 2019-02-10 14:07:25 Pessoal fica nessa exaltação do Night mode do Twitter - que usa um fundo azul horrível.

É uma encheção de saco a toa
3032 2019-02-10 14:06:58 Yes, but if more participants are buying ETFs--a basket as opposed to individual stocks--then it would increase breadth. This would also happen if passive share were rising.
3033 2019-02-10 14:06:18 Like U said, let the gullible ponies believe in their own lies. They make great laughing stocks.

3043 2019-02-10 13:49:00 ikr. they’re very private. whenever it’s about chanwoo’s family, they really edit it out. i just heard his dad’s voice in ikontv and that’s it. his dad apparently seems to have much knowledge in stocks.
3044 2019-02-10 13:47:02 I was buying stocks on Christmas Eve day.  It worked out pretty well.
3045 2019-02-10 13:46:01 Hello! Meron pa bang stocks yung album na sold out??? Kasi only once lang pwede mag-submit eh :((

Pourquoi continuer à « écouler les stocks », chaque samedi, alors même que les blessés graves et les mutilés À VIE se multiplient ??
3048 2019-02-10 13:42:40 Yes.  Our parents taught us to listen to them and not talk back.   The same rule applies in the market.   Properly bought stocks in a proper  market uptrend should go up,  not down 7%.   Something is wrong.  Keep your kisses small and move on.  #canslim
3049 2019-02-10 13:41:48 Well if you want some of their money, go buy their stocks.
3050 2019-02-10 13:40:37 Which fund manager are you with? Do you know the ratio of stocks to bonds that the fund holds?
3051 2019-02-10 13:39:17 More so is about knowing who you are. I’m extremely risk tolerant, but also am not investing my life savings in individual stocks. It’s money that I could lose and be very upset but doesn’t break the bank. Seemed better suited for a Boglehead forum than WCI. Just my two cents.
3052 2019-02-10 13:38:07 This feels way too one sided. Of course the risk of individual stock ownership is higher, but for the WCI people out there it feels a bit too conservative. I index my 401(k)s and portions of my backdoor Roth IRAs, but my taxable accounts are largely individual stocks.

3057 2019-02-10 13:31:56 The evidence is clear,

AGW relies on adjustments to measured data

CRU used adjustments to SST's
GISS use estimates of arctic temps
Paleoclimate records are all over the map

Scientists' predictions - OMG they're laughing stocks

3062 2019-02-10 13:26:42 I really enjoy Malcom’s insights. But  the affluent people I know own businesses, gentrify properties, invest in stocks and buy products that inject money back into the economy.  Better than letting congress decide what to do with it imho.

3064 2019-02-10 13:25:41 Exactly. We were told, that the benefits would flow down. Wages are still stagnant. They are buying back their stocks. Economists suggested permanent wage increases vs 1x Bonuses. Wage increases have a greater longterm impact. #GM is profitable, yet started layoffs.

3066 2019-02-10 13:25:10 I was being ironic 
3067 2019-02-10 13:25:00 You do realize there are different tax rates for gains made from stocks and gains made from wages, right? How you get money has a lot to do with how it is taxed. Not all income is treated the same.
3068 2019-02-10 13:21:59 He is on to you Rob!  Hudson's finest pork sausage stocks will be in freefall.
3069 2019-02-10 13:20:07 I've thought about this, and I can't guess the difference.  I thought the people that own stocks are the same people, THE people, that vote in elections.  Where am I going wrong?
3070 2019-02-10 13:20:01 Not everything is about you carla. Get back to the stocks. They need tending.
3071 2019-02-10 13:18:27 It's clear that the people in that committee do not know the law! I don't have enough room to list all of the wrong answers, I'll only list one. A person cant influence the price of stocks that they hold. It's clearly her case for communism!
3072 2019-02-10 13:16:11 @GrasimInd @AdityaBirlaGrp @NSEIndia @BSEIndia @SEBI_India @CCI_India Stock price manipulation going on by Grasim industries stocks operators and promoters....The company posted 1140 crore profits in q3 2019... Yet the stock falls around 5 % on the next day within first 30 mins.
3073 2019-02-10 13:14:31 Near zero interest rates caused the the long term rally in the stock market. Not Obama, cheap money was used to buy stocks and other assets with the cost of borrowing money being at near 0. Economics isn’t your strong point either.

3129 2019-02-10 11:53:41 You think you can change my opinion based on facts? 

For real though, even penny stocks, there are companies out there that are legit and have working products. Those are the ones I don't mind giving a shot - if I like the product.
3130 2019-02-10 11:53:35 That's correct, according to correspondence I had with Twitter. £ signs are not recognised as tags by Twitter. The "official" way to tag stocks is $<symbol>. <exchange> where . <exchange> can be omitted for US stocks.

3165 2019-02-10 11:09:39 20 Day DMA works well for a trading strategy IMO - but stocks u want to hold can get shaken out a lot. Not easy getting back in - lots of whipsaw. Plus I notice that what works one year doesn’t another yr High volume gaps worked great in 2017-early 2018 - not so much after
3166 2019-02-10 11:09:17 It’s been called “diworsification” and I couldn’t agree more. I only own 5 stocks (4 now). All of which are companies I think I understand and spend a huge amount of time thinking about. Just $AMD alone has consumed me for the 8 months.
3167 2019-02-10 11:08:59 An editor should put their writer in the stocks each time they submit and article quoting a “highly-placed source” and have literally zero evidence to back up any of their ludicrous claims.

3182 2019-02-10 10:55:19 individual stocks may be difficult to put into the right bracket BUT the overall market is definitely in the first 2 days of the "correction". There is a 4-5% drop around which it will be good to see if it can recover of keep dropping.
3183 2019-02-10 10:54:09 Eskom stated replenishment of water and diesel fuel stocks? Sounds like a weak excuse to me. Perhaps revenge for not getting the 15% odd increase they demanded? As far as we know, they are producing in excess of requirements, especially on a Sunday!

3187 2019-02-10 10:49:14 It happened because people were borrowing to speculate on markets in the belief that what they were buying would increase in price perpetually and they could sell their real estate or stocks for a killing, pay back their loans and make a profit.

3188 2019-02-10 10:48:56 I think the greatest risk is parents teaching their kids “truths” which actually are fallacies based on the experience parents themselves had.

3227 2019-02-10 09:43:24 it's good when used sparingly but it's unsafe on hit when it's sour or at low%s so dont use it often when they're low or else a smart opponent will punish you for it. it's really good sometimes though and can net stocks when they're in the right spot.

I’m only 27 as a project manager for an Aerospace company and can’t wait to keep closing on accounts to help grow my company (I don’t own it) My personal stocks grows larger each day! More you learn the more you EARN
3369 2019-02-10 06:10:17 Waiting for the reply of our supplier. Last time kasi may stocks siya ng EXO SG. 
3370 2019-02-10 06:08:24 I'll be confident with the market when Feb ends! Historically the end of Feb has been the turnaround point for US stocks.
3371 2019-02-10 06:08:19 I also think that since there are more stocks a wobble is less progress towards winning the game, it took at most 25% "total life" 

I think Bayonetta felt super bad to play against partially since we had so few stocks so each stock was more % of your "total life"
3372 2019-02-10 06:07:28 mama: silipin mo nga walang kape sa stocks

3373 2019-02-10 06:06:35 this is supposed to be a SERIOUS tournment. if you were up 2 stocks but then someone got a final smash ball and then rathalos from an assist trophy and won, would you think that's fair? no.

3390 2019-02-10 05:38:32 He's clearly been spending too much time with Henry Cejudo at this event. KG stocks going doooown.
3391 2019-02-10 05:37:31 You are not really in a bull market if a lot of money is chasing a few stocks in the indices & valuations are stretched. When falling knives are not caught indiscriminately & penny stocks turn in to multi-baggers.
3392 2019-02-10 05:36:39 Imagine instead of packs you bought stocks

3397 2019-02-10 05:31:10 Printing money to loan out to banks to buy bonds/stocks is a terrible idea to me. Spending money into existence however intrigues me. Specifically for projects that increase societal productivity and create jobs. #moneyvelocity

3403 2019-02-10 05:22:58 No one is expecting Nicki to tell us how to invest in stocks, but for me she's still rapping her ass off. I just get turned off when she is worried about everyone else and what they are doing.
3404 2019-02-10 05:22:51 I need to find people who are into stocks & know how to look for certain signs in the stock market of when to invest & sell

3408 2019-02-10 05:12:43 Since I started investing in stocks.. I know the government gon’ watch my shit.
IRS agents like:
“Tf this black girl know about stocks & she being legal about it?”
3409 2019-02-10 05:12:29 Rampaging bonds are the new tech stocks.
3410 2019-02-10 05:10:18 Bump stocks now... and what's next? "Assault Rifles" ? High capacity mags? All semi-auto rifles and pistols? Let the Libtard gun grab begin. #MolonLabe
3411 2019-02-10 05:06:56 That's the shallow take.

What she actually exposed runs much deeper. In the full clip, she talked about stocks and lobbyists and how the corruption game is played, and that as loosey-goosey as ethics rules in Congress are, they're STILL tougher on her than they are on the POTUS.

3413 2019-02-10 05:05:27 Psychic spies insinuated watching out for when I view any of my current free show listings on my Roku TV just for them to trade stocks accordingly and, at the same time, mentioned "Fandago."
3414 2019-02-10 05:05:16 Exactly...and she thinks nobody knows about this?  Boehner has been pushing cannabis stocks for a while. 
3415 2019-02-10 05:02:03 Here are the 3 stocks on my watchlist for this month.

3416 2019-02-10 05:01:29 Learn and Do. "Ignore the chatter, keep your costs minimal, and invest in stocks as you would a farm." Warren Buffett #enthusiasm
3417 2019-02-10 05:00:20 I agree with that statement. It's bubble-ish and telling factors are when people who never invest, start buying pot stocks.
3418 2019-02-10 05:00:10 They need to win at 2020 to do that! Trumps thinks more of its pipelines and oil stocks well being than USA national security and health!!!

3421 2019-02-10 04:53:33 just curious though..should they sell of their stocks (even bought before they got into office) once they run? How about if they own 401K with specific industry heavy positions? should they liquidate their 401Ks?
3422 2019-02-10 04:53:09 So @MikeBloomberg makes you attack Russia on economic news too? Russian stocks are up 30% so you Israeli neocons know more than investors?
3423 2019-02-10 04:53:03 Laughing stocks..
3424 2019-02-10 04:52:13 Congrats on picking winners, stick to stocks crypto is over your head
3425 2019-02-10 04:51:22 More than 60% valuation of Fb / Twtr / WA are bcz of Indian users alone. But it doesn't imply that RWs shd quit as long as we use it to contribute in a small meaningful way for NM-Bjp to win 350+. Meanwhile let Fb/Twtr stocks go to the dumps.
3426 2019-02-10 04:50:27 Mainly explorer stocks backing graphite mining average up 60%
Have stocks in small pharma company's researching psylociban in medicinal use those are prob average up 80% since davos talk.
Some small oil explorers which are down at moment to but waiting things out
3427 2019-02-10 04:50:11 Many congressional people have gotten rich on stocks, payouts to family etc. very bad and done by both parties. It would be nice if they voted to just have to be under the laws the make for us. To bad she is for extremely expanding government and forced redistribution of wealth.
3428 2019-02-10 04:48:07 How’re those stocks doing

3429 2019-02-10 04:47:53 I need to buy Nintendo stocks soon

3431 2019-02-10 04:47:17 Oh I hold shit loads but I also hold other and I also moved a bunch into stocks Jan 2018 and padded my bank balance nicely
3432 2019-02-10 04:47:15 If you bought just one or two stocks like Microsoft, and held them, you could probably generate returns like this

so, 
a) are his picks known ?
b) if so, does one or two lucky early picks account for growth
c) if no, how do we know he is good ?
3433 2019-02-10 04:46:02 an easterner is a stocks: autoerotic and oxidative
3434 2019-02-10 04:45:18 Theres this peach on elite called lalo that's really good, but it throws me off that he always uses 2 stocks so I never realize it lmao, pls use 3 stocks, it's not that hard ;-;
3435 2019-02-10 04:45:18 What about when he took 2 stocks with just sopo? 

Maybe it's something else
3436 2019-02-10 04:40:58 You got wobbled twice out of 12 stocks. Learn to beat ICs before you complain about them.
3437 2019-02-10 04:40:02 That's why I always invest in liquor stocks 
3438 2019-02-10 04:39:23 Andre Drummond is averaging 17 and 15 w/ over 3 stocks per game giving you B+ defense that occasionally morphs into literally the best shit you'll ever see but people think he's inconsistent.
3439 2019-02-10 04:36:35 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
3440 2019-02-10 04:36:05 Footwear/Bag related stocks start rising in Dec end till-Mar quarter 
Peak in June quarter. 
Everyone know the reason.
3441 2019-02-10 04:35:56 If investors are not buying in the inner suburbs then rental stocks go down.
3442 2019-02-10 04:35:51 @TSXcapital I have abs no doubts about WTIC going back to USD 140 and then USD 200 + over next few years. The only trick is to enter right time in oil stocks. We are guided by LT charts always for this.
3443 2019-02-10 04:34:52 If she wants to know how to get rich off of stocks while in congress she should ask Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters they have been doing it for a long time.
3444 2019-02-10 04:34:45 @ImranKhanPTI sir if imran khan saheb read this then i shall wrote down  this comments iam from water & power development authority, that all gutkas 121 stocks only burning into fire it so dangerious do not waste in water beacuse it will make water fatal for creatures.
3445 2019-02-10 04:34:07 It is always a problem if you know too much about anything. spoils the neutral balanced approach. Canada oil sector this has been the problem . A lot of Aussies lost their shirts post 2011 I guess , they know far too much about gold stocks.
3446 2019-02-10 04:33:19 Also erp relates to opportunity cost v other stocks and corporate bonds...
3447 2019-02-10 04:32:54 I am all in on cloche hat stocks.
3448 2019-02-10 04:32:40 Chart looks like shit. Shows how manipulated stocks are
3449 2019-02-10 04:32:29 At this point, #MSNBC has less cred than #FoxNEWS.

3454 2019-02-10 04:30:01 I think it's a good start because those earning 15$ an hour will spend it in their local economy which will boost everyone. High tide raises all boats kind of thing. As opposed to a trickle down which means hiding money overseas or buying back stocks.
3455 2019-02-10 04:29:46 @ anyone with more than enough money: have you ever considered that people sleep in the freezing cold every single night of winter? Maybe don’t invest in shitty stocks? Maybe donate any extra cash to your local homeless shelter? Maybe volunteer?

3457 2019-02-10 04:23:55 Exactly! It's strange to read the news each day about how "well" our economy is doing. Well? For who?

Our economy is doing well on the backs of those with whom the wealthy share almost nothing. The economy is only doing well for those who can afford to buy stocks in our demise.
3458 2019-02-10 04:21:42 im with you man. iv been mia with stocks. will slowly transfer some funds back into crypto this week. its been a boring 4-5 weeks.

3460 2019-02-10 04:18:43 I like oil stocks a lot, but refusing to look at them.

One of my successful investor friends used to say often:

Never look at a sector daily if you know it is in bear market ; never walk the brothel street for fun every day, you will end up entering one of the joints some day
3461 2019-02-10 04:18:34 I’m still feeling ao confident in my characters. Peach, Snake, & Corrin.

I just need to improve my confidence in my own self. ...And not SD 4 stocks every set lmfao.
3462 2019-02-10 04:18:32 Invest in @Tesla stocks.
3463 2019-02-10 04:17:20 Don't miss stocks, Turkish manifacturer used stocks. January data shows that stocks are used and new imports are required for production
3464 2019-02-10 04:16:46 Robert, lives on Bowsprit Ave with 9 hermit crabs.

Put all their savings into cayenne pepper stocks. Can't retire.
3465 2019-02-10 04:16:16 The LT charts were showing this early last year itself, the stock has been under accumulation by very smart investing minds for the long term.

These are the kind of stocks which gets the PM sector investors stinking rich if they are patient holders.
3466 2019-02-10 04:12:42 Plenty of games have infinites, plenty of games have touch of death combos. Games which don't have stocks, and which play less rounds than we do.

Ice climbers are one of the worst characters at getting grabs, with one of the biggest rewards for getting it and they are still bad.
3467 2019-02-10 04:12:30 The race-track gambler, betting on a "sure thing," is convinced that his commitment is safe. The "investor" in high-priced common stocks also considers himself safe in his reliance upon future growth to justify the figure he pays. ~ Ben Graham, Sec Analysis

Ex. Look back at 2017
3468 2019-02-10 04:11:11 @BaileyChappel it doesn't do what raiz / acorn does. I.e invest in stocks/ETFs. 

It does however do what ING does and rounds up into your nominated saver.
3469 2019-02-10 04:09:05 If you’ve ever run Monte Carlo dcf using rfr across a cross section of thousands of stocks you will see it systematically overestimates intrinsic value
3470 2019-02-10 04:07:28 Invest on stocks today!!!
3471 2019-02-10 04:07:18 Elon musk and our government are already working on making things greener. You can see it in oil stocks and production. When stock prices go down, manufacturer costs go up. But not this last 8 months. They’ve both been dropping steadily which only means that we are less dependant
3472 2019-02-10 04:06:18 They cost 1/6 to 1/10 of the flagship phones from US and Korea. Good quality and work as good for the main function.

So let's scare them to not buy Chinese phones or our stocks will keep on falling.

Surely this article should ended with the phrase "SPONSORED BY APPLE INC."
3473 2019-02-10 04:06:04 Their treasuries, stocks, real estate, portfolios don't feed a single soul right now and you can't prove that it does.

3481 2019-02-10 04:01:05 Heard a caller on radio who took $10K from  a student loan and bought stocks in early December trying to build it up so she could record a cd in January. Now she’s borrowing more $ for the cd cuz her stocks are worth $6k now - on a 7% APR student loan. 
3482 2019-02-10 04:00:45 I rank motor quite highly so it's Thybulle.  I think when an NBA player shows something instinctive, in this case, incredible stocks#s despite zone defense, it says a lot about overall upside.
3483 2019-02-10 03:59:29 @niftywizard @trainingwithJC I have discovered that I am very much biased on the long side and face difficulty shorting the stocks resulting in sizable losses. Please share some tips on how to overcome this bias.
