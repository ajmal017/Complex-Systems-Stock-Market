Then, figure out that!
Can tell you has a lot to do with National leaders -selling of American commodities.

41 2018-09-13 21:38:33 That's the exact opposite of what I said. Out of the 1.23 billion people, a mere 2% pay taxes which then has to be recovered from elsewhere resulting in higher taxes on commodities, in this case - Fuel.

52 2018-09-13 20:51:52 When things like education and healthcare stopped being relationships and started being commodities in the name of savings is when the experience started getting worse.
53 2018-09-13 20:51:18 Prices of commodities are determined by embodied Energy costs. 

Proper investments in ensuring "Energy security" should therefore lead to a fall in prices of goods and services in the long run.. 

The state of the Energy sector thus has a great impact on the economy.
54 2018-09-13 20:50:09 Don't forget Bill Clinton signed into law the gutting of Glass/Stegall & the commodities futures modernization act. There was no such thing as too big too fail until those two things happened. Of course the democrats blamed Bush for the economic crash.

81 2018-09-13 18:57:00 The problem is the idea that’s been normalized in our society that certain animals are here at our disposal or are commodities. Small scale farms still forcefully impregnate cows/chickens, keep them in poor conditions and kill them. The idea as a whole is not right.

History shows prohibition is directly related to violent crime. Look on further than the US’s experiment with alcohol prohibition. Profit incentives from black market commodities = more violence and higher crime rate.

125 2018-09-13 16:30:39 It ties to how capitalism fetishizes commodities to the point that what we consume becomes identity, and its sold to us as identity. The critique of specific industries is taken as critique of identity.

132 2018-09-13 16:03:29 allows for the continuation of the production and consumption of commodities; which again, directly benefits the employer/producer.  Simply hoarding capital without re-investing it is what causes economic crisis, famine, and eventual revolution.
133 2018-09-13 16:02:47 The real facts is “self destruction “ not destabilization of certain groups. DDS is now Dating Duterte Supporters.This could happen soon if economy turn upside down especially now high prices of commodities, rice shortages, high inflation rate, unemployment, etc.
134 2018-09-13 15:59:27 13. Apa yg TDK dilakukan pemerintah sblmnya tp dilakukan skrg adalah shifting dr commodities based ke industrial based. Prasyarat utama adalah infrastruktur dan konektivitas. Krn biasanya industri yg berinvestasi ialah industri menengah .

224 2018-09-13 11:20:05 If you think that Nigeria has made a single progress in the last 3 years, I want you to know that most of the people who lost their jobs in 2015, 2016 and 2017 are still jobless till now, remember also that prices of commodities are still at all time high, 3 years gone already
225 2018-09-13 10:54:14 I don't have list of commodities.
For now, we are having this debate on Petrol & diesel. 
Our PM used to criticize Manmohan Singh for increased petrolium prices.
226 2018-09-13 10:50:27 It is appalling. Dogs are not commodities.
227 2018-09-13 10:47:30 about price...give me 3 commodities name those price increase more then 20% in last 4 years...and compare salary from 2013 to 2018...it will help to calculate increase in purchasing power....
228 2018-09-13 10:34:54 Just view it as risk mgt, putting certainty into an operation, & you'll be fine, you can even lock the price of inputs/raw materials using derivatives, & not just output/commodities produced. If anything the counterparty assumes the risk, its insurance basically... no danger

231 2018-09-13 10:26:00 Cook is slowly but surely cornering the components market.  Makes their own high margin chips (A12, Buonic, etc) and dominates supply in commodities (flash, dram & soon flatscreens). > 200mm phones per year is no easy task either.

232 2018-09-13 10:15:43 Perhaps, she gets everything delivered to her free cost from traders, who are subjected to extortion by the Khangie Mafia. That’s why she does not know the prevailing market price of commodities.
233 2018-09-13 10:12:11 It’s a bubble.  Inflation is gonna crush the average American within 18 mos.  there is no tax break when commodities cost 30 percent more!!!  Spindoctors.
234 2018-09-13 10:10:14 You're either going to run into a situation where account credits and debits, through some sort of ledger, are balanced against each other, OR where some institution extracts some surplus value from labor generally to produce basic commodities.
235 2018-09-13 10:08:10 And now China think they can buy Africa, yaaani wametukosa hivyo?? its very painful to think about it. They take Africa to be commodities? for sure am in agreement enough is enough

243 2018-09-13 09:30:55 It's smart for the police but for a poor man looking at it is like a thorn in his fresh. Uhuru can you please look for remedies which can control the cost of basic commodities like rice and maize flour. Maize is rotting in NPCB and it seems no one is ready to solve that.
244 2018-09-13 09:18:00 All Bharat Bandh is observed on 10th sept. for increase of petrol/diesel prices . Indians are not happy.......PMO must answer the cause of price rise on petro commodities ...............
245 2018-09-13 09:14:20 India - the government raised the price of #ethanol made directly from #sugar cane juice by 25%. It is hoped sugar mills will raise their ethanol output at the expense of sugar #production to help reduce stockpiles. Will this do the trick? #commodities #India #energy #policy
246 2018-09-13 09:09:14 Till 2013, increased fuel price meant increase in transportation cost that general public avail every day. Fuel price used to affect vegetable and other commodities due to transport cost. But now we know petrol & internet data can be compared. Revolutionary!

256 2018-09-13 08:36:36 What this administration now needs is a very strong economic program that can turn this inflation around. There is very little they can do about the price of gasoline or the Peso/Dollar exchange rate. But they need the price of rest of the basic commodities to be within reach.

263 2018-09-13 08:04:56 It's the other way round - they think it is a gotcha for precisely those reasons. As if Marxists have never thought about the question of labour which isn't productive of material commodities until some dude in a pub in 2018 thinks "haircuts!!"

272 2018-09-13 07:25:59 yes, but have you seen any sign of one of those? In the absence of some means of making UK<->EU27 trade not count towards quota use our local trade will dwarf the quotas in most commodities I think.
273 2018-09-13 07:25:33 Very interesting panel. When KEPSA says they will aggregate commodities from the small producers how will they do that considering Kenya has had a failed cooperative system previously? What will be different this time to ensure there is fair trade?
274 2018-09-13 07:16:21 The words "Just like any other commodity" completely discredit your view, show lack of understanding.

336 2018-09-13 02:36:18 Isang malinaw na manipestayon na ang pangtaas ng presyo ng sili at iba pang commodities na may malaking problema ng agrikultura at food sufficiency sa bansa.

340 2018-09-13 01:58:32 La convertibilidad estaba bien, el problema es que fue justo cuando el dólar era muy fuerte, los commodities por el piso, combinado con crisis tequila en el 95, la crisis asiática en el 97, la crisis rusa en el 98, devaluación del real en el 2001. 3 años despues, boom de la soja.
341 2018-09-13 01:40:15 This is why when u have a billionaire owner you don’t “rebuild” You spend money on known commodities and you your farm system to aquire even more known talent. “ rebuild is for loser organizations like the Pirates and Royals.
342 2018-09-13 01:37:22 Trump doesn't understand that other countries respond to the tariffs we put on their goods, by putting tariffs on the goods  (including farm commodities) that they import from us.  We are all being hurt by increases in tariffs.  Tariffs lead to the Great Depression.
343 2018-09-13 01:33:08 Anybody invest in stocks, commodities, futures, foreign currency?? Let's talk about retiring early.
344 2018-09-13 01:30:07 @sureshpprabhu Sir.. The Agri ministry able to make decision on MSP for 22-commodities based on cost of production, then why not "Minimum Price for Green Tea Leaf" by the Commerce Ministry.
345 2018-09-13 01:24:45 Prices- prices of essential commodities will triple by 2029,no one can control it,nor bjp nor congress,because our population is increasing n production is decreasing,maximum farm land is occupy by flat,maximum misuse of petrol,n unammounted corruption
346 2018-09-13 01:18:26 Sir Jasper: Nowadays, food, shelter, and clothing aren't your basic commodities anymore.
Me: Sex!
Sir: Sex?! You? Coming from an academic person?

Sir. We have our ways to get our needs 
347 2018-09-13 01:15:29 If people can afford things outside their necessities yet they complain on their purchases for their basic commodities.. ah okay, government pa din ano?

349 2018-09-13 00:55:19 Free trade. Tariff on our commodities will kill the agriculture community!!  This farmer wants free trade.
350 2018-09-13 00:50:07 It’s a completely different scenario. Puerto Rico is an island which required commodities to enter from only certain ports. Those ports took awhile to become operational. Without ports can’t get supplies. NC/SC commodities can be brought in over land.

352 2018-09-13 00:45:05 I think he cares too much. He's in brat tantrum mode when fighters don't become perfect marketing commodities. He prefers yes men like liddell, Hughes, Sonnen, McGregor etc  Have you met him personally? Hands down always outrageously good to the fans. Several times I've seen it
353 2018-09-13 00:43:50 #CrudeOilDaily chart: The long term trend, based on a 45 bar moving average, is UP. The short term trend, based on a 9 bar moving average, is UP. MACD is in bullish territory & the market just put in a 45 bar new high today. Look for more new highs  #OOTT #OPEC #Commodities
354 2018-09-13 00:41:49 Pautot na naman. Creating another crisis scenario kuno to divert attention from rising prices of commodities and devaluing peso. Pag ang mamamayan nagutom baka papatay talaga yan.
355 2018-09-13 00:27:39 Ongoing trade talk events drove markets last night- the latest being the US has reached out to China. The US missed PPI data significantly, pushing the #USD down. The #AUD was strong, assisted by commodities having a good night. Crude, Copper, Zinc and Nickel were all up.
356 2018-09-13 00:20:43 This administration lies all the time. They want what they want.People, children, animals, the environment - all are commodities to be used & manipulated.  There are no ethics, values, traditions to be respected. Stumpy’s roundup demonstrates there are only “their” laws.
357 2018-09-13 00:15:43 There’s a degree of “ain’t broke so not gonna fix it” that I respect in this age of disposable commodities but on the other hand really it is broke
358 2018-09-13 00:15:22 “This little piggy” is capitalist propaganda. 

This little piggy went to the market. Here the pig goes to the market to sell his labor and exchange commodities 

This little piggy stayed home. 
This a vailed references to the patriarchal structure where women pigs stay home.
359 2018-09-13 00:15:02 None of those players you mentioned were proven commodities
360 2018-09-13 00:14:07 Sério, Costinha? Difícil.. podia assistir, mas enfim.. cartel de bancos, Embraer e soberania nacional e projetos de desenvolvimento nacional (fazer mais aqui ao invés de exportar commodities)
361 2018-09-13 00:04:14 In any case, thank you for your time and your civility. Rare commodities! You turned this around, when I wanted to thrive on adversity for adversity's sake... not to go all woo-woo on you.  Have a fine rest of the day (if there still is one in your part of the world). Cheers
362 2018-09-13 00:01:04 Yet some people have the guts to see movies but complaining about the prices of commodities.
