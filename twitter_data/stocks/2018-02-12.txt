58 2018-02-12 23:33:19 No matter how you slice it, the market is miles more expensive today than it was when the boomers were at a comparable stage in their careers. Which means that millennials can’t expect the same payoff from U.S. stocks as their parents. @gadfly

104 2018-02-12 23:03:01 Crypto would be great if we had money to burn, but? Definitely not crying about missing out on $36/ozt gold. At least not while going long on cannabis REIT. Millennials hate stocks? It's our system. You can't hate stocks. You have to be educated, wise. Don't be pressured.

135 2018-02-12 22:49:50 #Stocks,#Indexes  Looking like the resolution to the quandary is this exorbitantly  persistent rally out of a near non-signal. And, it now appears a  significant top signal is emerging, but with completion tomorrow or, more likely, Wednesday.

148 2018-02-12 22:43:31 Probably because when stocks fall a bunch of rich fucks get poorer and pass the loss down but when it goes up the rich get richer but none of it trickles down, so it doesn't really effect anything enough to be news.
149 2018-02-12 22:42:47 A thought: reason media try to report the worst is to artificially influence the stock market knowing its a blow to leadership. It gives them something else to report on. When stocks are up they can’t say leadership is bad because everyone is making . Dishonest media!

Sure. Smaller return compared to stocks & fluctuates on value

Rare coins or art? Very small markets of niche investors. Good luck selling in economic downturn.

325 2018-02-12 20:46:33 Because inflation has changed everything. We are at the point that more money printing will hurt bonds. So ECB and BoJ will have to pull liquidity which will damage stocks.

370 2018-02-12 20:23:24 Yes.  The 1600$ I’ll save this year is worth opening up refuges to drilling, increasing the deficit, and further lining corporate pockets, (which are currently holding around 2.3 trillion in cash reserves ) of which a majority stated they will either buy back stocks or pay divs
371 2018-02-12 20:23:10 if bonds "normally" rise as safe haven when equity falls, what happens when int rates are LT rising? 10 year bear stocks AND bonds? other than vol. something's got to rise..
372 2018-02-12 20:22:57 Current ~10% PB in stocks is our Bear Stearns preview. Later this year, likely pre Midterms, the Lehman main event occurs with a drop in stocks of 20-40% IMHO. Next, Fed and global CB reversal to monetary insanity on steroids... or collapse. Got #Gold and/or #Silver yet?

383 2018-02-12 20:16:36 Personally, I feel safer just buying more silver (under 16.60) than directly shorting stocks. I know we will see surprise negative rates, someday. And, you won't want to be short stocks when it happens.

402 2018-02-12 20:08:22 Soros is above all a speculator who profits from crises.
Wherever he can sniff out conflicts, he has the means to 'financially' stir them into crises & make a good kill at the end of the day (cf. US coal stocks).
Apolitical, amoral, literally 'make your own luck' kind of bizman.

435 2018-02-12 19:46:48 If you were to invest $5000 annually from age 30-65 with just a 10.09% return in stocks (which is easy to get) you’d be a millionaire at 65. 
My goal is to invest $10,000 annually so that when I’m 40 I can be at that status JUST from stocks. Not including real estate investments

520 2018-02-12 19:11:18 At the beginning stocks and sauces were central, still a lot of cooking and prep. Continuity across the board. Not saying is was great food – I just thought it was an improvement on a lot of what was then available

523 2018-02-12 19:10:47 BREAKING (AP): Stocks surge on Wall Street; Dow Jones industrial average gains 500 points.
524 2018-02-12 19:10:12 Best movers today are all the oversold stocks that were deep in their patterns, like $AAPL...indexes still a bit below their 50-dmas...
525 2018-02-12 19:09:37 @gvkreddi do you have any books to refer to gain knowledge on stocks and analysis?
526 2018-02-12 19:07:07 @RobinhoodApp Hi I use your app and I keep making stop loss sells, but instead they keep processing as market orders and because of it I just made two day trades on accident and sold stocks that were doing well that I didn't want to sell. :/
527 2018-02-12 19:06:36 It would seem that rumors of the demise of $AAPL have been greatly exaggerated! #stocks
528 2018-02-12 19:06:17 Wagers that Whitman is mentioned on Money Matter? Stocks fell because of Whitman....

559 2018-02-12 18:58:30 I see it as two evolutionary lines.. one is eating into futures mkt, single stocks. But the other is eating into MFs, that line is alive and well and bulk of new cash
560 2018-02-12 18:58:21 Good waste of money. You should donate it to a veterans fund or some other worthwhile cause. Stocks are up BTW. And is only part of an economic indicator. And as employee wages rise you typically see investment drop due to lower profit margins. But you knew that.

573 2018-02-12 18:53:50 Cause it doesnt work! Trumps idiocy on trying to just have a simple tax plan is ALREADY BITING US IN THE ASS! Comps are STILL moving jobs out of US using tax cut to buyback stocks only 13% going to employees which DOESNT HELP ECONOMY
574 2018-02-12 18:52:30 I dunno but I'm long on stocks for 11 years. Then short.
575 2018-02-12 18:52:13 Commodity sector stocks will outperform during the final 2 years of this bull market. Inflation is coming

580 2018-02-12 18:49:48 Before you send me an article on the market about to drop 10,000 points and never recover, please research the author. The guy who called a bear market every year for the past 5 years is not a reliable source. Neither is the guy who said he sold his stocks when Trump was elected.

594 2018-02-12 18:39:06 The word is lose. Incorrect, just because it takes a dive over two days means nothing. It was bound to occur. That's the way the stocks work.

606 2018-02-12 18:35:16 I beg to disagree in terms of stocks. Yes 2009-2014 was consolidation for Nifty I agree. But some stocks tumbled 70-80% in 2011 bear. Some in 2013. And also in 2015. Some mainstream stocks tumbled heavy.

609 2018-02-12 18:32:30 It's been a WILD day for T-bonds with a higher high and lower low than Friday... an "outside day."  Question is whether it will be a breakout or bust.

615 2018-02-12 18:29:07 A lot of ppl keep saying their school never taught them about finances, or how to file taxes. I literally learned abt all that shit. Stocks, bonds, W-2’s, how to save. Allat
616 2018-02-12 18:28:54 Either way, you need jobs first for people to spend so you can charge tariffs; starting with protection doesn‘t in and of itself build that base, and can actually hurt. (Especially in countries relatively lacking in natural resource stocks or industries making capital goods.)

625 2018-02-12 18:26:03 I had faced only 1 Bear Mkt of 2011 Which destroyed 70% of my wealth. But I traded those stocks to get back in profits well. Most exited in Profits after 6 7  years though. The next Bear I will be killing it to short to the core. I Don't think it's coming soon  yet.
626 2018-02-12 18:25:42 The media thinks it needs to explain why #stocks fell: int rates, vol ETPs, risk parity, annuities, index funds. The only explanation that matters is: MORE SELLERS THAN BUYERS. Focus on losses vs expected losses. Don't worry about why the scorpion stings-just how u will handle it

629 2018-02-12 18:22:44 Trumpers, Get out of stock market! The worst could be Dow goes down to 15000. The first stop point could be 22000 or 20000. If u still want to support Trump in 2020, get out of stocks in any bounce then wait until the market settles down. It's no joke. Sell your stocks!
630 2018-02-12 18:22:08 Wall Street's main indexes rose for a second straight session on Monday, led by gains in technology and financial stocks, after its worst week in two years as the specter of rising inflation led to fears of accelerated interest rate hikes.

644 2018-02-12 18:12:38 Trumpers sell your stocks in any bounce. The market isn't at any bottom. The 1st downside goal may be around 22000 to 20000. Then u can make some short term $. There may be far deeper than we can realize now. I don't know the 2nd downside goal will be.

650 2018-02-12 18:07:43 @realDonaldTrump Trumpers should seriously consider to get out of stocks in any bounce. Sell your stocks anytime u see markets go up two or three days. Until the markets reach the 1st downside goal, maybe around Dow 22000 or 20000, there may be a chance to make some short term $.

My observations. The traders from Pre 2008 Era are so scared that they think some stocks will always be in Downtrend. And they also think 2008 like crashes comes every 8 10 years.

673 2018-02-12 17:56:18 84% of all stocks owned by Americans are owned by the wealthiest 10% of households (NYT). 

I don’t think the issue is the rich getting richer, but lower income individuals not being educated on the opportunity to invest their income. This would change investment at its core.

686 2018-02-12 17:50:09 The patterns are choppy, So, even the market is bouncing well, such patterns may likely fail? Today's action seems too emotional. I think the individual stocks' pattern not good as the index.

704 2018-02-12 17:42:41 The way they could stop stocks from falling would be a qe4 and/or stop raising rates and even decreasing them which in turn would be good for the bond market (not counting inflation which might drive yields higher).
What did you mean by saving either of them?

Let's see what will happen. Maybe market will fall more or less than I think. Do your generals understand the markets?

725 2018-02-12 17:30:00 No. Peter has been ripping every asset class for decades he calls every Market correction well of course every Market corrects  especially after a big run up. if you listen to Peter it doesn't matter if it's Bitcoin real estate stocks or whatever you'd miss every Big Bull Run
726 2018-02-12 17:29:40 This annoying guy in my business cal class was bragging about how he sold all his stocks and my prof said "mike just stop we all know you're lying."
727 2018-02-12 17:29:32 Yes the credit union products are terrible compared to stocks but your next of kin won't have to go through lawyers and probate to get access to the money in your golden harvest or whatever...they get the cash immediately
728 2018-02-12 17:29:06 Crypto,stocks,bonds all risky
729 2018-02-12 17:28:29 And there will be people like Peter still saying gold is so great to buy it even though it's the worst asset class there is and they'll be saying not to buy real estate or stocks or crypto or anything else and you'd miss all the bull runs in history
730 2018-02-12 17:26:55 If you die your stocks dont need to be insured, your next of kin inherits them. Truthfully, the credit union products are TERRIBLE. They take your money and guess what they do with it? (HINT: the answer is "invest in the same stocks youre afraid to)
731 2018-02-12 17:26:53 Obama inherited an economy in free fall and turned it around. It rose - jobs, stocks, etc. - for seven years. Trump inherited a healthy, growing economy and is ruining it.
732 2018-02-12 17:26:23 @realDonaldTrump trump you bum you didn't say one word about the stock market it's so obvious you can't talk about your loss to stocks all your fault you took credit now you own it loser!!!

734 2018-02-12 17:25:40 3. I am convert to the idea of stocks but whenever someone asks me about it, I also warn them that a company can have it's share price tank as well as rise. You have to know it is risky and you can LOSE. Not everyone can afford that risk.
735 2018-02-12 17:25:17 Oh god please Gina keep buying stocks.  And all Trump supporters should follow.  Put at least 50% of your salary into the market.  As #Potus  said - It can only go up!!!!  And when has he ever been wrong.  #trump #maga #stocks

737 2018-02-12 17:24:18 2. I am glad you can admit some of the products at the credit unions are not bad and I consider these more like savings than stocks...you can break the contract same day and get your cash. It is also insured in case of death. Stocks are not
738 2018-02-12 17:24:07 When everybody else was jumping out windows we were going 300% long tech stocks last Friday morning ....human behavioral patterns never change
739 2018-02-12 17:23:07 *sigh* 

1. I disagree on not saving AT ALL because stocks on their own are an investment where you buy shares right? You have to SELL to get your cash value. Now we all know that's not as simple as going into bank for cash. What happens in an emergency (particularly weekend?)
740 2018-02-12 17:22:49 Going to buy a bunch of military stocks
741 2018-02-12 17:22:21 I agree. The more stocks go up, the more I'm buying.
742 2018-02-12 17:22:15 It’s bad but would be SLIGHTLY better if they added muzzle breaks, flash suppressors stocks, etc to break up the reused models. In 95% of the cases it’s just a slight tweak to the paint scheme & with shaders on guns makes this even worse.
743 2018-02-12 17:20:57 Peter's arguments are horrible the gold standard does not work. He is just a doom and gloom person who says he calls everything of course every Market corrects and he'll be right but you'd Miss every run up of every market stocks real estate Etc he is not good to listen to.

780 2018-02-12 17:09:07 And that's just short-term. You guys seriously would trade a huge profit increase to avoid a notion of selling indecision? I'm glad I don't have that feeling...it must be horrible. I have positions in both stocks, personally. = )

926 2018-02-12 16:06:54 Recent drop in stocks is a Bear Stearns moment and we head higher to ~3000+ once the low is in here shortly. BUT I believe the Lehman moment occurs later this year, possibly pre Midterms and S&P dumps 20-40%. Then a blow-off top to ~4k by 2020/21 on Fed reversal. Just MHO.

950 2018-02-12 15:59:53 The mechanism that makes the most sense to me is that QE doesn't do much, but the idea that the fed was protecting us with QE caused risk on/risk off in yen, bonds, stocks etc, similar to jawboning.

This isn’t a recession. There’s no need for fiscal stimulus when stocks triple in a decade w/ no drawdowns or volatility.
1168 2018-02-12 14:49:50 Stocks open higher on Wall Street, Dow Jones industrial average up 300 points in early trading. Some great news.

1171 2018-02-12 14:49:01 $TWTR am amazing at how well our Jan 37 calls are holding up after a massive +631% move on the eps gap up. One of the better stocks in the current tape imho.
1172 2018-02-12 14:48:14 Essentially, this correction in the market doesn't affect the individual American on average because those people either aren't retiring tomorrow (401k, etc.) and don't own stocks otherwise.

1179 2018-02-12 14:45:42 Per NPR's article, they specifically were talking about active trading and not 401k's. Per their article, only 13.9% of American households own direct stocks. That figure jumps to 51.9% IF you include 401k's and mutual funds.

1298 2018-02-12 13:59:35 As investors try to determine whether inflation is on the rise and higher interest rates are imminent, volatility may continue. After 2017's smooth sailing in the markets, these fluctuations may feel harder to withstand. The reality is that stocks don't go straight up forever.

APPROVAL RATE RISING WITH TRUE POLL, NOT FAKE NEWS!!!!!!!!!
1302 2018-02-12 13:58:25 If the Fed is forced to reverse course on rate hikes and QE later this year as stocks dump 20-40%, throw all the technicals, positioning, sentiment out the window imho, Gold and Silver going a lot higher.

1307 2018-02-12 13:57:18 Just stated that only 13% of corporations will trickle down anything to the workers! Middle & low income got nothing while rich will be cashing in on those STOCKS! Wonder if I went up & down my street how many neighbors have STOCK?? Nothing nothing for us but all for Trump!
1308 2018-02-12 13:57:02 And investors will flee to bonds for the higher yields making the interest paid on our national debt soar. @realDonaldTrump IS running the US like his businesses: into bankruptcy. Meanwhile stocks will keep crashing, wiping our 401(k) & 403(b) savings. Unfettered capitalism sucks
1309 2018-02-12 13:55:59 Are US stocks closing the overnight gap or sell-off-ing?
Trader's dilemma.
1310 2018-02-12 13:55:49 Takeaway: Even when stocks lose more ground than they just did, they eventually recover.
1311 2018-02-12 13:55:46 If you analyze the S&P 500's 15 worst days - where the index lost an average of 8.16% - stocks were still in negative territory one day later. In 13 instances, stocks were back up within a year by about 21%; they were in positive territory 5 years later. @FirstTrustBank
1312 2018-02-12 13:54:00 Yes but could be a temporary phenomenon as bonds fall and wait for stocks to catch up.
1313 2018-02-12 13:52:31 Investor don’t punish such stocks & managements... till that time this non sense would continue
1314 2018-02-12 13:50:52 The lowest tax bracket went from 10 to 12% they got a hike and an inability in many high tax states (blue) to try and claim some on their state taxes hurting lower income people. Nothing the tax code did stopped companies from divesting enough to buy back 40% of the stocks

1318 2018-02-12 13:49:46 Stocks took a beating last week as the threat rising interest rates sent equity investors running for the hills. After months of relative calm, market fluctuations are causing many investors to wonder what is happening to the economy.
1319 2018-02-12 13:49:27 Separating freedom of speech from hate speech is the same as separating eroticism from pornography. Jews have less problem with the former as women have less problem with the latter. For reasonable people, both are made into laughing stocks.   This farce can't last much longer.

1323 2018-02-12 13:48:10 Have you heard about “impact investing”? It’s KPI is based on ESG - environment, social, governance. Investing in those stocks are not only ethical but financially wise as you hedge on a lately identified as significant risks.

1341 2018-02-12 13:39:29 With all due respect, a strategy with a formula baked in to sell stocks as volatility increases deserves retrospection.

1346 2018-02-12 13:37:26 Some stocks are great for the SIP mode of investing. These are stocks we should accumulate, in small steps as they represent long term value. They are companies which have proven track record. These companies have a solid, stable and ethical management. #SIPsahiHai.

1469 2018-02-12 12:09:52 The stock market is not a casino. Therefore selection of good stocks has nothing to do with luck- neither is it a matter of 'random walk' theory as believed by some inexperienced university dons

1475 2018-02-12 12:05:39 84% of all stocks in US owned by richest 10% of Americans. Yet more evidence that the ups & downs of the stock market don't represent what's happening in the real economy.
1476 2018-02-12 12:03:57 BBH: We share the assessment of #Fed officials that sell-off in US stocks has not yet reached a point that it would derail economy... With a high degree of confidence (71% chance by #CME calculation & nearly 87% by Bloomberg's assessment), the market anticipates a March Fed hike.
1477 2018-02-12 12:03:50 It’s not untrue. Your step daddy Pence and his little protest tantrum was an insult to the US and his SK host. You are all laughing stocks of the whole world. History will not be kind to any of you.

1487 2018-02-12 11:52:24 STOCK MARKET COLLAPSE! Since everyone was investing in stocks, they were becoming overpriced. Companies were overproducing but not selling as much – making less profit. Stocks dropped a bit and after investors panicked, and the prices plummeted as they just wanted to be sold off.

1490 2018-02-12 11:50:35 biggest issue for retailers is knowing which sizes to stock now, I'd imagine. If no one stocks bikes with a certain tyre size/spare tyres/tubes etc then it's doomed from the start.
1491 2018-02-12 11:50:32 Is there anything in the @realDonaldTrump administration that @BarackObama didn't do. @BarackObama his not been in the white house in over a year. How in the hell is he still doing shit in the place without being there? They blamed him for the stocks falling last week too.

1628 2018-02-12 09:46:47 The stock market is not really an indicator of how well the country is doing.  So the fact that Trump uses that as an indicator is wrong.  He takes credit for the stocks and bonds going up since Obama's term.If he wants that credit, then he also gets the credit when it goes down.
1629 2018-02-12 09:45:55 oh, those bloody shareholders.

1640 2018-02-12 09:35:53 Not only will jobs be eliminated, income inequality will become turbocharged. Land prices will escalate as the top 10% "bank" their wealth in land, instead of stocks/bonds. The common Trump voter is the section of the population first effected by this trend. They voted /1

1832 2018-02-12 06:39:11 ETFs and Index Mutual are my core, while stocks are the riskier side of my investments. So because of that, I'd be more inclined to sell my stocks regardless of research/due diligence. Index Mutual Fund's and to a lesser extent ETF's risk is < stocks because the risk is spread.
1833 2018-02-12 06:38:49 And indeed looked 'sinister' on Fri. Huge volumes & v little liquidity on stocks, down to the 200d ma. VIX to 40. 2Y TSY yield bid to the moon to 2%.

The truth was SWA failed to properly manage de-icer stocks. We need to be compensated, and you should rethink your customer relations.

Without one you can shoot as fast as you can pull the trigger- fucking horrifying in the wrong hands.)
1936 2018-02-12 05:11:05 @randpauI @KennedyNation @BenSwann_ I believe our markets are overvalued and our wages debased because the Federal Reserve makes tons of dollars available. Everyone wonders why market goods are so expensive now, well here you go! (e.g. food, stocks).  Will people understand this?

Actually, a reasonably smart person from today could be a professor in a lot of subjects from a hundred years ago.
1967 2018-02-12 04:44:59 I would invest in stocks on the extreme margins-then cash out just before the crash. I would then turn around and invest in stocks that I know would survive into my time period-simultaneously I would find George Washington Carver and invest with him politically and scientifically

1986 2018-02-12 04:26:12 Throwing more stimulus had an already overheating economy will cause interest rates to go up, inflation to go up, and stocks to go down. At this point, the more stimulus they throw at the economy, the more it will make it overheat and bring us closer to recession.

2181 2018-02-12 02:06:58 October 29th, 1929 was a day that took place called “Black Friday”. The stock market crash of 1928 played a part to accelerate the global economic collapse. The stock market collapses because the stocks were over priced, products dropped because of over production.

2230 2018-02-12 01:25:43 Bear in mind that number of stocks in bullish "trends" is based on weekly charts in my method, so reacts slower. The number of stocks in bullish mode (=daily) is currently only 7% (red line in the chart). It started dropping in late January and has never looked back.
2231 2018-02-12 01:23:17 $VIX 29 - this was somewhat troubling. I would have thought, this should have dropped more. Also, IV in stocks like, $BABA, $MSFT, $FB etc was up for the day and should have also come down.  Trade structure here is important.

2287 2018-02-12 00:32:55 Economy went from a recession to booming under obama. Stocks went from 5000 to over 19000. Unemployment went from 10 percent to 4.7 percent when left. He left a thriving economy for trump that trump is starting to fail on. Get some facts
2288 2018-02-12 00:32:44 Lol. stocks tank, GOPpers are wifebeaters, pedophiles, childtraffickers, obstructors, nazi's and KKK. You are paying for a wall, @PaulRyan gives people a #buckfifty and fills his own pocket and Pence pisses his in his adult diaper when he sits at the Olympics. #TimesUp
2289 2018-02-12 00:32:27 Thanks! He doesn't talk about which stocks he is trading, or show P/L, so I wouldn't follow anyway 
2290 2018-02-12 00:32:07 How about doing some research for a change instead of listening to the idiots in the msm. I'd you did you would know that it is because of President Trump the stocks rose at a quick pace, that the reason for the sell off was because of computer generated short term stocks and the

2292 2018-02-12 00:29:49 Q. Where do you find returns?
A. ALGN, NVDA, BABA, ALB, KATFF

Massive macro bullish tailwinds for all those companies. I could speak for hours on the merits of each one, but I’m sure you’ll DYOR anyway. 

I’d be disappointed with 30% returns from that portfolio. Not bad 4 stocks
2293 2018-02-12 00:28:32 Wouldn’t want to rely on this strategy for individual securities. The so-called “Capitalism Distribution” suggests ~2/3 of listed stocks eventually disappear. So would want to use an ensemble of diverse alternative metrics, ie EBITDA/EV, P/S, P/B for indiv stocks, for example.
2294 2018-02-12 00:26:37 Stocks crashed over 1,000 last week. Groceries are ridiculous price off gas has gone up. You defend domestic violence jobs are part time paying 10.00 an hr or less w no benefits. Let alone you selling off national parks to corps plus MORE.@marcorubio @SenBillNelson @RepRooney

2298 2018-02-12 00:20:57 I’ve always thought combo/follow up/punish game was more important that neutral personally. You can get but so much from your neutral but you can literally end stocks from from a good punish.

2302 2018-02-12 00:20:01 Janet Yellen says the stock market is over valued on her final day in office and stocks tank for a week. (thanks Janet!) If that doesn’t show the degree pure speculation plays in pricing, I don’t know what does.
2303 2018-02-12 00:19:46 For #3, do you set a volume or price limit on the stocks to avoid the super illiquid ones?
2304 2018-02-12 00:19:41 I will watch also these stocks newt week $CPST  & $REXX for continuation. $LMFA & $NCTY  for bounce.
2305 2018-02-12 00:17:50 $es_f up 16. I am looking at $spy 271 to scale out of longs . Volatile times its best to stick with $spy and index etfs rather than individual stocks
2306 2018-02-12 00:16:59 Globalist corporations are responsible for this. Real wages increased earlier this month & Wall Street punished stocks considerably. Which is why they want unlimited immigration- 1) to remove labor pricing power 2) Make any worker replaceable from a global labor pool NONCIPROCAL.

2310 2018-02-12 00:13:46 Pop quiz:  what allocation do you think Tim Backshall has: (1) all Gold or (2) a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.
2311 2018-02-12 00:13:28 interestingly, even at the peak correlation, BTC correlation with stocks only reached 33% -- much lower than I would worry about when I allocate by ETF portfolio

2314 2018-02-12 00:13:01 Spanky found out and still defended the wife beater. I’m just hoping he doesn’t FUCK Up the GREAT job #Obama did. Stocks are up from the recession Obama inherited & more poor folks have HealthCare. For now at least.
2315 2018-02-12 00:12:30 Salmon farming??! ....  As in breeding them for purpose, rather than ransacking the oceans, depleting stocks?  Now I've heard everything ... why?

2323 2018-02-12 00:06:53 Nothing, rates go up before stocks top and go down. Do your homework.

If I had any stocks, bonds, or funds through Merrill Lynch, I'd immediately divest because of the coming crash. Don't say I didn't warn ya.
2327 2018-02-12 00:03:17 $LIB is garbage ... if you have to pay someone to pump your stocks to line your pocket and finance your operation that’s criminal
2328 2018-02-12 00:00:30 Yes, I certainly wouldn't prescribe the "worst 5-year performance" strategy for individual stocks. But for large aggregates it makes sense. Entire stock / bond / commodity markets rarely go to zero.
