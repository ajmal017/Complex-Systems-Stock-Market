43 2018-09-10 21:10:14 each time govt would not had been able to increase it too much. So in this particular case we had been deceived by two branches of govt. One is the executive branch who is taxing essential commodities at 100% which effect poor people and writing off debts of big corporates....
44 2018-09-10 21:01:17 The USD #DXY is at a pivotal point right now - and will drive the worlds markets one of two ways:
A stronger $$$, bad for commodities & foreign currencies/economies.
Or a weaker $$$, bullish commodities (esp gold) and foreign money

IMO I think a strong USD Till atleast till Jan
45 2018-09-10 21:00:40 What about other commodities like PMS, why can't it be taken to other part so as to be easily accessible to all and sundry

46 2018-09-10 20:53:28 @LaTrioli @mjrowland68 harvest contractors face little return on heavily depreciating assets. Also tough times ahead for transport operators who specialise in bulk commodities. The principles of Farm Management Deposit scheme should be extended to businesses so dependent on Ag.
47 2018-09-10 20:53:26 Well said, it’s that dumb.  Supply / demand is investors not the commodities.
48 2018-09-10 20:52:43 See that's the problem with us, the people of current world. Whenever a Right-winger (myself) approaches a Liberal (I'm assuming you are) for any conversation, liberals always judge and make the topic economical as if we are exchanging commodities.
49 2018-09-10 20:51:25 Will anyone face any sanction? Of course not. Oh, except the poor pupils who are just commodities and data, and a means to make profit. Shameful
50 2018-09-10 20:46:57 What we need in Kenya now Mr President @UKenyatta is an immediate tax cut for low and middle income groups in order to increase demand of our local commodities and purchasing power and hence grow more revenue from taxation #VAT

53 2018-09-10 20:33:07 I don't use Facebook, but this is really disturbing. Having lived in Thailand for several years this isn't surprising, animals are very much commodities there & you can acquire ANY animal you want for the right price despite what the authorities say.
54 2018-09-10 20:25:59 that's the entire point, isn't it?  to turn the citizens of the USA into commodities who exist solely for exploitation by the neo-fascists and their corporations

65 2018-09-10 19:45:39 Does it seem far-fetched and inconceivable to envision a future in which tech stocks fall and commodities (i.e. real stuff) rise and perhaps even outperform?

Certainly feels like delusional thinking atm...
66 2018-09-10 19:42:23 ....contained by 1) very well-managed government countercyclical interventions, 2) exchange rate depreciation absorbing the shock 3) being the lowest cost producer for many commodities, which allows for share gain in downturns.

69 2018-09-10 19:33:40 This is too real. And yes, especially white Americans are left with practically no culture BUT capitalist commodities, so building an identity out of their consumption is a sad but understandable phenomenon. I do it myself a bit. But like. Read another book, folks.
70 2018-09-10 19:31:58 Why dont you show the situations of daily wagers they are very vastly effected by increasing in commodities prices mostly and they even dont had the dinners after doing hardwork due to there low level of income plz stop criticising
71 2018-09-10 19:30:46 I was just being cheeky. I know he was asking how many different coins we are going to accumulate. While I trade them all, and forex, and equities, and commodities, and indexes, the only thing I am trying to accumulate is BTC. For the next few years at least.

73 2018-09-10 19:16:27 People forget that we used commodities widely in the pre Revolutionary days. Tobacco, Whiskey, Hemp, etc. This idea would not be so different.
74 2018-09-10 19:15:12 Anger over high petrol prices is a false alarm..it's all a manufactured outrage..
Fuel isn't the only commodity in CPI..its impact is only 5%-10% on share of consumer wallet..if one compares the share of wallet of all commodities in 2014 & today, people are far better off today..
75 2018-09-10 19:06:19 Volatility in commodities (along w money velocity) is at historic lows. This is INTENTIONAL & accomplished by the all powerful ESF of the US Treasury w HFT, no Uptick Rule, in collusion w the Fed/Banks. This is done to mask the fragility of our broken Keynesian financial system.
76 2018-09-10 19:04:06 Dig the podcast, especially the ones where you explain what the fuck stock options, commodities and now stock buy backs are. I would like to see more on financial products than personal finance tbh. Maybe shot gun a beer for the intro too? Just an idea.
77 2018-09-10 19:01:06 3rd quarter unlikely to be anywhere near 4%. Q2 had one-time spikes in purchases of commodities, particularly soybeans ahead of tariffs. Meanwhile, those tariffs have not reduced the trade deficit. It went up significantly.
78 2018-09-10 19:00:36 Big cos, in the board rm, talk about avg employees like commodities, trust me. Sorry but it's true, it's never been more so. Managers r rewarded 4 keeping salaries low. Avg people need 2 understand & bring bk unions.

95 2018-09-10 17:52:45 If India stops consuming or cuts consumption of imported commodities, we will gain bcoz our money will remain with us. 

Srinivasan Jain is a highly motivated Presstitute.
96 2018-09-10 17:51:01 Imported commodities must not be subsidised by any govt at the cost of the Taxpayer.

Developed countries stopped subsidies on imported commodities over two decades ago. 

Any rise in price always leads to a fall in demand and a consequent fall in foreign currency outgo.
97 2018-09-10 17:47:45 Oh... Such deep concerns for daily wagers daily income. BTW what about the misery faced by them due to uncontrollable rise of prices of essential commodities.
98 2018-09-10 17:44:33 The Modi government will be doing a good lesson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to win the Bharat Bandh on behalf of all parties across the country to condemn the price hike of petrol, diesel, gas and essential commodities.
99 2018-09-10 17:32:04 Please control rise in prices of Diesel and petrol because if they are at top level then inflation will never come down because each and every essential commodities are link up with prices of Diesel and petrol.

101 2018-09-10 17:30:30 c. The book describes commodities as a "risk on" asset, but importantly this isn't true of gold. What implications does this have for the place of gold in a portfolio?

103 2018-09-10 17:19:21 A rise in the price of any commodity leads to fall in demand. 

Imported commodities are priced at globally benchmarked index. Why crude oil should be an exception?
104 2018-09-10 17:18:19 And 2 yrs old kid lost life.... You are asking PM answer for skyrocketing prices of essential commodities have some shame... It's results of all your 70 yrs of loot which leads country to suffer now... You took loan against oil bond to raise own account balances...

106 2018-09-10 17:12:16 This tweet made me happy at the end of the day. Very correct ,just the prices of commodities can't replace Modi. He is the only person who can change this country and free it from congress. @narendramodi is the only choice for India.

108 2018-09-10 17:09:07 Yep ....every time they raise pay rates and incomes ..all goods and commodities raises their prices to balance out for their own benefit, it seems anyways.
109 2018-09-10 17:04:47 Pls dont forget to address the issue of spiralling price of commodities
110 2018-09-10 17:02:29 Mature reasonable people stay and work it out. But I will also say that if you are involved in a relationship based on commodities rather than love, friendship, and honesty, you are doomed to fail.

112 2018-09-10 16:50:58 Both Tulo and Martins deal expire next year, making them tradable commodities at the deadline. If not sooner.

113 2018-09-10 16:50:47 Hahaha seems like Cong is importing all these commodities from Italy..... Otherwise price in India is way different than what they have shown...
114 2018-09-10 16:49:40 I'm finding that developers these days are being treated like commodities instead of valuable assets.

116 2018-09-10 16:44:05 Media is forcefully inserting in minds of people that public is angry because of all around price hike and public knows that commodities prices are very much affordable

118 2018-09-10 16:41:10 Most stupid argument. There has been no price increase in commodities. Rural people have not complained. All they said is, even if price rise to 100, we will not vote for congress.

123 2018-09-10 16:24:55 La única forma de hacer plata con commodities que se me ocurre, es que uno mismo sea el dueño de la finca, el que transporta, el que selecciona, clasifica, empaca y vende el producto.
124 2018-09-10 16:22:45 Stupid reference to Man City and soccer where they BUY the best players...players are traded as commodities and massively paid! None of which holds true for GAA amateurs
125 2018-09-10 16:22:12 Exato é, agricultura familiar é importantíssima. Mas não dá pra querer passar por cima da importância do agronegócio pra economia nacional. Vamos lembrar que foi o boom das commodities no governo Lula que instigou um cenário econômico ideal ao crescimento social.
126 2018-09-10 16:15:02 Neoliberais mesmo são só as igrejas que disputam o dízimo oferecendo liberdades como se commodities
127 2018-09-10 16:14:38 I still cant believe that IK is our PM. He is in the government. Its is the right of the government to tax the public to run the state and it is their responsibility to tax the luxuries rather than basic commodities.  is lucky to have a ruler who will improve social justice.
128 2018-09-10 16:07:33 Youre right. But rich is the only ones should be taxed to improve the social status of the masses. IMO it’ll still be better than taxing basic commodities like flour, lentils, petrol etc.
129 2018-09-10 16:02:17  this legal cruelty . Viewed as commodities 
130 2018-09-10 16:01:12 #BharatBandh The Oppos party run StateGovt's objected to bring Fuel under GST. To bring any commodities its need a consensus by all in d Council. NoOppo party run Govt.even reduceVAT & Other taxes.Shame of Congress,Lefts,RJD & Others.People r not full,will give right ans in2019
131 2018-09-10 15:56:41 why isn't the govt. Decreasing the tax levied on it?? As to put in simple terms I guess the tax is collected on the basis on percentage and since the basic price has increased the tax collection would also have increased plus since the prices of other commodities... 1/n
132 2018-09-10 15:55:03 During MMS regime 2006-14.. Massive inflation took place. Prices of all food items, vegetables, essential commodities, real estate went up. But no Bharat Bandh during his term.
Today for not reason Cong is enforcing a Bandh and imposing hardships on people.
133 2018-09-10 15:55:00 Pardon my ignorance, but will those 2 cobra helicopters help improve the country’s economy? Will it help alleviate the condition of the poor who can barely eat because of the high prices of commodities? Will it help lower our country’s inflation rate?
134 2018-09-10 15:54:32 Partha Chatter said the govt was against the increasing prices of essential commodities like petrol, diesel, cooking gas and the falling value of rupee.

Now Government must think to bring down prices of petroleum products n its spiralling effects on essential commodities,transport sector n general economy. Hope,authorities will consider.Otherwise consumers like us will suffer
137 2018-09-10 15:52:43 @PMOIndia @ncdex @SEBI_India @FinMinIndia Can anyone give true reason behind the fluctuations in ncdex commodities except "SPECULATION". 
Anyone???
138 2018-09-10 15:49:00 @narendramodi 
Not a right time to hike essential commodities including petrol and it's products , please reduce them else it becomes your Waterloo in forthcoming elections , please exercise strict control on patroleum ministry.
139 2018-09-10 15:46:54 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.

146 2018-09-10 15:20:10 Suggest a solution to curb the frequent price hikes on fuels as well as on the essential commodities.?
147 2018-09-10 15:19:03 If you buy commodities like onions, then you might be knowing that the prices keep rising and falling depending on the rains. They have been this high in these 4 years as well. Yeh jo IT Cell wala gyaan hai na copy paste wala..har jagah par mat baantiye.
148 2018-09-10 15:16:55 The conundrum.
Also, as it becomes more widely regulated and traded, then commodities behavioral rules will start to apply limiting speculation growth.
149 2018-09-10 14:59:48 Branded goods are far away from commodities produced by farmers; price paid to farmer bears little relationship to retail price. Skewing negotiating power more towards manufacturers - who gains: the farmer or their shareholders? @COPACOGECA @AIMbrands @FoodDrinkEU @paolodecastro
150 2018-09-10 14:55:31 I took a course on commodities last year and it was there I took an interest in gemstones. Iv done extensive research on them and invested in literature in the same, I recently spent sometime somewhere where they are vast but due to lack of knowledge people dont see much value.

152 2018-09-10 14:52:50 Liar Dotard, U.S. Companies stock piled products, and farmers pushed commodities to China, in the last quarter, in anticipation to avoid tariffs, thereby pushing up the GDP. Tariffs is your magic wand for last quarter. It will backfire in the next quarter just before elections.
153 2018-09-10 14:49:16 Gold prices were higher on Monday as a lower U.S. dollar bolstered the price of the precious metal.

155 2018-09-10 14:43:05 Fooling the country by providing near free 1 GB data from crony capitalists where as essential commodities like fuel are at all time high

Even rupee is at its lowest
156 2018-09-10 14:41:39 #WOW Draft Dodger ! Gas is at 4 year high. All commodities run by the Rich have risen , what are you bragging about the Tax Scam. No job  coming home , still leaving . Tariffs a joke ! Liar 
157 2018-09-10 14:37:18 These taxes are being used to repay the loan which your bosses have took.
These taxes are being used to run various welfare pgms.
Max petrol price in UPA was 83 ish. Now a mere 5 r/s increase is causing a hurt burn to you. Prices of essential commodities hv come down, lets talk!
158 2018-09-10 14:35:09 No Govt can afford to disregard plight of people with galloping fuel price and consequent price increase of of all commodities. To talk of 2022 is far fetched when clouds are gathering for 2019.
159 2018-09-10 14:30:21 This step may also be taken on all commodities like,  toothpaste,  soup,  mobile cards,  soft drinks etc
160 2018-09-10 14:29:41 I believe it's what he was trying to tell us all along. He never gave direct predictions, always clues. And to now know the CBOE &CME will be backing the NYSE crypto platform. They made the rule to being with ti control price on commodities. Leads to big money either way.  ;)

163 2018-09-10 14:22:28 Approximately 80% of the Farm bill goes to nutritional programs food stamps etc. with crop insurance, conservation, and commodities representing about 19% (farmers). So most of your taxes go to the needy
164 2018-09-10 14:18:33 Does it matter if someone from the crowd said Murdabad.The Nation is United against price rise of every commodities. Can our Modiji led govt curb accelerating price rise. This video may enthuse Bjp but at the end of the day they need to ponder are they not suffering too.

166 2018-09-10 14:09:42 Doesn't "cooperate" mean I do X for you if you do Y for me? Like a system of exchange similar to bartering?

170 2018-09-10 14:06:07 Respected DMK President, Majority of the people live in Tamil Nadu are middle class and poor  and rise in fuel prices will result in further rise in both essential services ie transport charges and subsequently will have impact on essential commodities.

173 2018-09-10 13:57:33 But of course, inflation is never constant across commodities! I remember Amy Grant covering the song in 1995, changing the lyrics to “twenty-five bucks”.
174 2018-09-10 13:50:14 Petroleum product to be sold out at par may give downward trends to price hike of all other commodities too for cheaper transportation, cheaper energy cost of irrigation and fuel charges. Price may only be constrained by no profit no loss trend to may be adopted in energy sector.
175 2018-09-10 13:47:58 @AP24x7live Even when 1$=72.5 ₹ and when crude is at 72, all commodities are under control price as current account deficit is under control. Not like UPA days when a kilo of Onion costed 100₹ and dal was around 200₹.
176 2018-09-10 13:46:49 i know this take is no longer remotely hot but a corporation capitalizing on a social justice movement and making their commodities into symbols of “resistance” is so transparent and yet people are buying their shoes more than ever
177 2018-09-10 13:45:47 Respected DMK President, The increase in fuel prices not only affecting the middle class people but it will have impact on poor and downtrodden and people live in below poverty line due to rise in prices of essential commodities. Bharat Bandh sucessful. Tks. &congratulations.
178 2018-09-10 13:42:39 Ok why it wasnt reduced when tne  global prices were half? Were we paying 40 then? And totally its not at all right to inc prices of basic commodities..

rest myth of diesel creating inflation proved wrong in multiple ways.

181 2018-09-10 13:36:18 MARKET UPDATE: My indicators suggest continued strength for U.S. stocks and early signs that the recent weakness in international stocks and commodities is slowing. I view dips in those assets as buying opportunities. Risk/reward in fixed income remains unattractive at this time.
182 2018-09-10 13:34:35 What about people changing consumption patterns e.g. reduce frequency and number of vehicles in use. Again prices of commodities are likely to go up, meaning consumption might reduce, no?
183 2018-09-10 13:27:26 Socialism provides liberty. By liberating people from want, from exploitation and oppression by capitalism, people are genuinely free to live.  Your market freedom is a delusional freedom based on freedom to sell your labour and purchase commodities.
184 2018-09-10 13:27:09 Thoughts... what if Trump weaponized the Fed to put pressure on EMs  particularly China during trade negotiations? What if doing that ALSO pushed reflation trades down, which made all the commodities US would need for major infrastraucture project cheaper?
185 2018-09-10 13:25:21 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world.

191 2018-09-10 13:09:11 Govt always fills the hole when econ falls off but they never shrink back govt when econ roars, we need an automated system based on percentages/inflation etc, remove the politics, back currency with a basket of commodities, not rocket science just takes willpower
192 2018-09-10 13:07:15 Has our currency really moved away from commodities, it rises and falls according to demand for our resources and our economic output. If Govt created fiat to enable the full use of our resources would we be a more wealthy country?

196 2018-09-10 12:49:26 Checked up petrol prices in Mumbai on 14/9/13. It was Rs 83.63 per litre. @RahulGandhi ji pl check up IOCL website. UPA 2 was ruling India. Is the strike not a mispropganda against @BJP4India . Prices of other commodities are under control. You owe answer to the nation.
197 2018-09-10 12:49:23 No.Because in that case #States will claim compensation due to reduction in tax . How will central govt pay this huge deficit? Definitely by bringing new taxes on other commodities .So it will back to same .#GstNoSolution
198 2018-09-10 12:40:30 Yes, people bestow value on items and the market is where we negotiate those values, but, one is able to utilize the market value of labor - including labor in creating rare commodities - as a way of approaching a mean valuation of something that its price will fluctuate around.
199 2018-09-10 12:37:42 But where are the profits. Generic drugs are supposed to be very inexpensive. That means low profit margin. People should consider generic drugs like commodities.
200 2018-09-10 12:36:39 ¿De qué "matar a impuestos" me hablás si acá se vive del blanqueo? El tema impuestos es que sean PREVISIBLES y que los paguen todos de la misma forma. Y sobre todo, que la política sea industrializar y no exportar commodities, no podés vivir de exportar bajo valor agregado.

206 2018-09-10 12:27:47 I wish this news can bring down the price of fuel, kerosene and other commodities that has gone far beyond the reach of Nigerians
207 2018-09-10 12:26:15 Sandy Boy! You forget to consider the prices of essential commodities. Which are the cheapest I have seen in recent times.

209 2018-09-10 12:21:56 Pluto there are several ways to protect against inflation.  Try real estate or commodities.  Strong economy = inflation an issue that will never come up in liberal/dem platform.. they want you dependent on gov.  Get off Obama’s tit,  wean yourself from gov hand outs & proper
210 2018-09-10 12:18:19 Jobs during Trump's term actually grew at a slower rate than Obama's second term. GDP is being inflated by buying commodities prior to trade war tariffs and retaliation. Stock market growth has been purchased through $1.5 trillion debt financing corporate tax breaks.
211 2018-09-10 12:17:58 Since the Oligarchs & Elite..(chiefly Chinese nowadays)..

Given by Aquinos&LPs Incredible Control+Wealth from Key/Critical Industries..

This INCREASE IN PRICES of Essential Commodities is meant to deliver a Message to DU30 that they are not happy with their Income versus BEFORE
212 2018-09-10 12:15:40 Leaving the emotions aside, fuel inflation can not be seen in isolation as cost of running personal vehicles as it does lead to inflation in various other commodities too.
213 2018-09-10 12:12:57 Modi govt increased taxes on diesel much more than petrol pushed up inflation costs of infrastructure essential commodities costs for farmers burden on the poor much more than rich

216 2018-09-10 11:54:24 Aman sir does the economy only works on petrol prices? Or are you making this a debate bcz it's already hyped topic by other parties? Plz see the PP of other commodities also. @Shehzad_Ind is giving all the logical reasons of price hike let him complete.  #2019KaPetrolBomb
217 2018-09-10 11:49:41 Copper should toward its mean, with resistance near 2018's $3.30-a pound high in play.

218 2018-09-10 11:47:46 1) you shouldn't presume to know what i have or have not looked into, especially considering that 2) you misinterpreted the whole thread. 

3) Its not about individual athletes, but the whole system of exploitation via exhorbitant fees, merchandise, & other useless commodities.
219 2018-09-10 11:47:39 Disagree, watching and reacting to macroeconomic trends is very profitable. Just ask commodities traders.
220 2018-09-10 11:44:05 Please check out book “Reminiscence of stock operator”. Same things happened to stock and commodities. Same Barts Simpsons and cornerings of markets. Then markets matured and regulation matured things ended. It took x years to mature.
221 2018-09-10 11:42:56 You'd go long commodities off just that potential pain threshold?
222 2018-09-10 11:41:52 To the Coalition, principals and conviction are merely commodities to be traded to the highest bidder
223 2018-09-10 11:41:49 Abey sinha, petrol/diesel sirf personal vehicle mein use nhi hota hai. Price hike ka direct effect economy pe aata hai. Transport cost badh jata hai and saath mein commodities ke bhi.

240 2018-09-10 11:05:26 "Weekly CoT Sentiment Update for Major FX, Commodities, and Indices" The most recently released report didn't show any major shifts in market positioning, but we did finally see dollar traders take a break from adding to long exposure.
241 2018-09-10 11:05:16 BJP May give many reasons to defend Modi government !

But the fact is NDA has came to power in order to reduce the price of the fuel and other commodities.

242 2018-09-10 11:02:25 This fuel price hike will leads to all commodities price increases and final results poor and common middle class Indians will be suffering but other side Rich and corporate leaders will enjoy the profits???!!
243 2018-09-10 10:59:16 @INCIndia a former ruling party, you guys should have an idea of how international markets influence prices of various commodities your so called “BHARAT BANDH” is nothing but an attempt to statisfy your ego. Be smart protest in a manner that country’s economy doesn’t choke up!!!
244 2018-09-10 10:49:26 This doesn’t take away from your point and the authors Recs about reducing variability are useful, but I wonder about using yields as a risk indicator versus overall returns... for some commodities, prices are more variable with conventional vs organic products..

The divergence reflects the impact of speculator and momentum selling caused by stronger #USD
247 2018-09-10 10:45:09 Hey @RahulGandhi baba see it yourself,  we can pay more for commodities but can never see Congress winning
248 2018-09-10 10:41:44 2. This has not translated into any inflation on essential commodities which is what is necessary for common man

252 2018-09-10 10:17:48 Raising your input costs expecting to add value to a market isn't how commodities work.
The labor theory works for guessing market price/# of profitable miners ratio but misses several finer points re: coin fungibility, network security, sunk costs, ect
253 2018-09-10 10:16:53 are you worried about the prices of commodities now?
254 2018-09-10 10:14:52 @AmEugeneAnangwe in reference to last night topic of EAC trading #infocus we also need to have a one standard board of Commodities.....

269 2018-09-10 09:15:41 Except petrol what are the other commodities in which the price rises
270 2018-09-10 09:10:26 Anything that is not bond note or Zim dollar is a good idea for me, I am not an economist but from my lay man understanding, it is better since we get most of our commodities in SA. I was in Namibia 3 weeks back, their pricing is the same as SA its better

273 2018-09-10 09:03:45 Thanks for sharing. In France no official kill shelters.Shelters are full because owners claim that pets don’t suit their life any more (new job, birth of a child, divorce etc) or because of behavioural issues. But it’s mostly because pets are considered commodities to discard
274 2018-09-10 09:03:15 Rather than reducing taxes for short term gains. Loans were taken in huge amounts by INC. And the only way to pay them is by taxing some commodities. On the other side why aren’t you able to see prices of essential commodities slipping down? Veggies etc. Petrol is a political 2/3
275 2018-09-10 09:01:58 Then raise it to Rs.500/-Litre....Everything affected by fuel not individual mode of transport.
Food commodities,Manufacturing products etc, Would be definitely increase in price of everything.
276 2018-09-10 09:00:49 Yes.The price of essential food commodities are in check so we are laughing. don't know where you put petrol but it's okay as long as the money raised is being used for infrastructure.

281 2018-09-10 08:57:48 We are  silent,We know reason behind petrol price hike,You&Some media supporting Bandh ,Just Analysis prices of Essential Commodities,Groceries , House hold items ,Compare price study,you will get answer,last4y,Less ,Only Petrol price is high due to some reasons that is temporary
282 2018-09-10 08:55:28 Govt is responsible and compelled the common people to protest due to unbearable price hikes in commodities
283 2018-09-10 08:52:30 USD appreciation has effected all the currency, rise petrol price is only due rise in crude oil price,u want  presnt govt to make mistake by giving subsidies and effect the economy n unfortunately v the middle class look at only petrol price but not on drop of other commodities
284 2018-09-10 08:50:21 Huy unsaon, proud kaayo ang isa kay nag increase daw ang revenue sa Pilipinas tungod sa train law, unya nganong kontrahun daw ni sir? malamang gitaasan ang tax sa basic commodities, mag taas sad ang revenue gurow Mas mashock ka kung dili magtaas. HAHA. My gahd.
285 2018-09-10 08:48:08 Look at prices of the dals and the veggies and they have been brought down by nearly 60-80% and only for a single commodity which has risen due to external factors causes you more pinch than that what was on more essential commodities
286 2018-09-10 08:41:46 Tell that to the people who’s already suffering from higher costs of basic commodities.
287 2018-09-10 08:39:34 May be you are getting all daily use commodities free, either you have lots of money to pay high cost. 

Not for congress not for bjp

For Indian people.
288 2018-09-10 08:29:30 When u know ₹72/lt is not cheap why were there no protests 4years back. Accepted tht petrol prices do effect other commodities but does that seriously mean u will change the govt for this.  What abt the good done by this govt? (1/n)
289 2018-09-10 08:26:06 Modi just has 1 more year and there are a lot of countries yet to visit for Modi and the centre need to make up for the money loss on his vacation tours. The best was is to increase the price of commodities. The fun fact is that even after all this some fools still support him.
290 2018-09-10 08:25:51 ₹72/ltr is not cheaper petrol neither ₹82.
The macroeconomic price of petrol is highly exploited, and you cannot ignore the ripple effect it will create on the other essential commodities. You cannot compare the macroeconomic petrol price to individual level.
291 2018-09-10 08:24:17 You are right violence is unacceptable and soaring prices of petrol and diesel also is creating violence at homes due to rise in all essential commodities and the house budget going haywire.

297 2018-09-10 08:09:39 Be it Petrol, Diesel or other Essential Commodities, the dramatic increase in their prices have put an unprecedented burden on the common man. 

Today's #BharatBandh aims to highlight the mismanagement of the economy by the NDA Government. #MehangiPadiModiSarkar
298 2018-09-10 08:03:09 Respected sir @Swamy39 and why shouldn’t the govt of this country make it public how they set the prices of petrol and other commodities so that the people of world’s largest democracy know how d economic policy of d country actually works for them n all.
299 2018-09-10 08:02:05 VIKAS ke naam per petrol, diesel, LPG cylinder ke daam be tahasha barha diya geya, price of essential commodities touching to sky, unemployment increasing day by day.  BJP JAWAB DO.

304 2018-09-10 07:52:53 Our time is the most precious of commodities - not profitability and an endless squeeze on costs. Pay people a minimum wage for their heartbeats, not perceived value to a business which knows not how to measure it. The rest follows.
305 2018-09-10 07:52:36 For common man you can compare essential commodities price of UPA  & NDA. And by the way not to forget the Rs.2,00,000crore loan  repayment done by @narendramodi ji & @dpradhanbjp ji taken by @INCIndia as #Oil bonds
306 2018-09-10 07:47:37 Back then in 2013 you said fuel price hike is a failure of government.  Now, you need to show some courage and speak up sir. Fuel hike is directly proportional to the daily commodities price.  @narendramodi #BharatBandh
307 2018-09-10 07:45:59 Conflicting messages from markets. Strong US employment growth, record highs for U.S. equities and low volatility are at odds with typical risk-off signals such as tumbling emerging market currencies and equities, weakness in commodities and new strength in defensive stocks.
308 2018-09-10 07:45:49 Nobody wants anything for free, but Government (be it any) should atleast try to keep the prices of basic commodities under control.
309 2018-09-10 07:43:21 @narendramodi I am in favour & in support of BJP but against the hike rise in price of Petrol And Diesel. Coz these commodities are necessary for common people & their prices shud not reach sky..Its really upsetting for common people like us.
310 2018-09-10 07:32:57 Yes, Always under the essential commodities act.
311 2018-09-10 07:26:42 It took many years to bring consensus on common commodities. Now you are asking consensus on petroleum products which is major source of fund collection, many BJP and non BJP ruled state will check their feasibility and bringing on board will take a lot time than those of now.
312 2018-09-10 07:26:17 What happens if the prices of petrol , diesel and other essential commodities goes up? It does not affects he politicians from Kashmir to Kanyakumari ,because these parasites are enjoying their life at the cost of  the Exchequer.
313 2018-09-10 07:24:55 Bhai.. It's complex...!! Higher USD have implications.. May not be direct on some commodities but surely .. an economist can elaborate more..!! But out rightly rejecting it's implication is also wrong...!!
314 2018-09-10 07:24:14 Prices of essential commodities, it is not at all possible!. Just citing the de- valuation of our currency at the international market for the sudden fuel hike won't convince  our people!.
315 2018-09-10 07:21:31 For you only goons of SP are public. I'm trying to find the ' mehngai  but can't find . Prices of most of the commodities are under control.
316 2018-09-10 07:18:24 Given the drop in the value of the yuan it only makes sense commodities would be more expensive, but this indicative a deeper problem for China's mercantilist economy.
317 2018-09-10 07:18:16 Agreed verbatim! But have we seen any major rise in the cost of essential commodities of late?
318 2018-09-10 07:16:54 Cost of fuel affects cost of all commodities because goods are supplied through trucks and lorries. If cost of fuel increases, cost of transport would increase, which in turn would increase the cost of the product.
319 2018-09-10 07:14:30 Not a bad move at all but should’ve seen this shortage coming. And what about other commodities. Ah, we just wait ‘til there’s shortages then we provide tempo solutions.
320 2018-09-10 07:11:51 I don't think petrol diesel rates will ever go down , as we import 85% of crude that too in dollor, and it's also rising , each govt maintain it's CAD thru crude , and do development no major source of income to govt after taxes , govt is business man in most of commodities
321 2018-09-10 07:11:07 Might as well throw out all of capitalism because it’s very nature is to exploit resources, regions and people. People and the land are the commodities. That’s not new
322 2018-09-10 07:01:34 In fact, along with fuel prices, prices of other essential commodities (such as milk, daal, train fare, platform ticket etc) have also skyrocketed under Modi govt. imposing an additional financial burden.

323 2018-09-10 07:00:10 Assuming a person drives 50 kms a month even a 20 rupee increase in petrol increases your expenses only by 1000, as long as other commodities are in check it does not hurt you that much
324 2018-09-10 06:58:37 Petrol, diesel and cooking gas price rising . Rupee slides to 72.50  to dollar. Misery of the common man increasing as fuel prices impacting price of essential commodities. Arrogant BJP insensitive. # President, Samajwadi Party, Odisha. @fuelonfire.
325 2018-09-10 06:58:12 This is not a reply to my tweet.All commodities are brought under GST as decided by GST COUNCIL.Fuel was kept out by council.Why and at whose instance? Bring it under GST and no reason to blame  centre.
326 2018-09-10 06:53:48 1. the non- stop  colossal rising of basic commodities prices like rice, all kinds of vegetables, beef meat, fish, dairy products, bread.
2. high unemployment rate

328 2018-09-10 06:47:38 If people from Meghalaya have to come to your native place to buy commodities at cheaper rates then how much would they have to spend in all. Cost of 1 kg tomato + cost of traveling expenses + cost of accomodation?

344 2018-09-10 06:10:00 I think the problem is @bjp4india allows propoganda to float around -remember the #OnionPrices which brought down the #MadanlalKhurana govt. There are loads of things where prices have come down on commodities. Unfortunately the lack of political communication puts all off!

350 2018-09-10 05:37:49 #BharatBandh #MehangiPadiModiSarkar how is government going to control prices of petrol and diesel because it will impact everything and prices of essential daily use commodities will rise abruptly due to this

361 2018-09-10 05:05:48 I think banning expensive imported commodities is good. They are even importing fresh milk, bottled water and bakery items as well. There is a demand which will create space for local vendors for these items.
