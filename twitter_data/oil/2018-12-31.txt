3 2018-12-31 23:59:18 1tsp red pepper flakes, 1 clove, garlic, 1tsp sesame oil, 1tbl soy sauce, 1 tsp sugar per batch, + green onions/sesame seeds.

Seems a lot lighter on the pepper flakes compared to another recipe I found

36 2018-12-31 23:56:39 If Beto makes a statement & rejects oil exec donations >$200, us progressives will rally behind him. I was personally hoping for a Beto/Harris ticket. Honestly not sure Beto is viable as a candidate if he doesn’t take a strong stance the against oil lobby/corporate corruption tho
37 2018-12-31 23:56:23 I am sure you are pleased that oil prices are down 25%. That is like a tax cut for everyone. 

Thanks to Trump for stripping regulations to increase US energy production and pressing OPEC for lower prices.

And it is the last thing Putin wants...

39 2018-12-31 23:56:01 Bro I know this thread, I know d SBRS story etc 
40 2018-12-31 23:55:52 happy new year, i’m spending it by watching magicians and getting stoned. installed a shelf in my room and i got my salt rock lamp going and i hooked up my oil diffuser so i’m here to have nothing but the best time alone in my cave
41 2018-12-31 23:55:48 There is not a school, hospital or infrastructure project for or social program in Canada that has not benefited from the taxes and royalties generated by the resource sector. Alberta despite low oil prices still has one of the strongest gdp growth rates in Canada.
42 2018-12-31 23:55:14 Wow, I didn't know it was so bad. I can tell you that every vehicle has its problems. The Mercedes diesel V6 has sludge issues where engines blow up with low mileage and they can't figure out why. Their guess is graphite in the oil which they reduced in the new spec.
43 2018-12-31 23:55:09 Friend : kembang api, sate2an.. 

Me : imboost,  UC1000, young living oil.. 
*berasa tuwir 
44 2018-12-31 23:55:05 Yea, and that's why big oil companies can basically bribe politicians to vote against regulation. I'm saying it shouldn't. Individual humans have have rights, not super organisms competing like animals in the jungle.
45 2018-12-31 23:55:00 みこちゃん遠いー
46 2018-12-31 23:54:57 My car wasn’t running right so I checked the oil before leaving for work and it was low, so I topped it up. Got two miles into the journey when it started to stink. Stopped and found I’d not put the cap back on. Half the oil had splatted out all over the engine and everywhere.
47 2018-12-31 23:54:24 Oh seriously? That'd be awesome! I've had severe acne for 10 years and have only recently found something that helps (tea tree oil wash) but I'd love to learn what else I can get that isn't prescription based! Also makeup tips to hide blemishes while cosplaying is always welcome!
48 2018-12-31 23:54:24 That's one sweaty man. Could bottle his sweat and sell it as snake oil.
49 2018-12-31 23:54:22 It was vegetable oil & yes I had some to spare. 
50 2018-12-31 23:54:20 Big oil hahahahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
51 2018-12-31 23:54:07 We were not at war with North Korea so not getting nuked in 2018 isn’t really an accomplishment , and being at peace with North Korea is not an accomplishment with their human rights record, if they had oil.....

53 2018-12-31 23:54:00 Why don’t all of the people that are against oil stop using anything containing petroleum products? Start with anything containing plastic. @AOC can lead by losing her phone and walking barefoot.
54 2018-12-31 23:53:26 Oil.
55 2018-12-31 23:53:25 Really? Ok. I’ve only had the oil.
56 2018-12-31 23:53:15 Taken more pipe than a Saudi oil well
57 2018-12-31 23:53:00 Just thought about this; I know it’s been a while but what happened with the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico
58 2018-12-31 23:52:54 Use CBD oil, we use this for our dog and Works somewhat
59 2018-12-31 23:52:30 this is literally adorable ohmydnck
60 2018-12-31 23:52:24 Great. Hold the corporate democrats to account. Seems ridiculous to have oil money involved in environmental policy. They brought us to this crisis moment, so time to move past their influence.

64 2018-12-31 23:50:59 Lagos Governor just urged Lagosians to re-elect Buhari as President. On the same stage minutes after, Seun Kuti is performing “2.8 billion Naira, oil money is missing” (in 1977). Who was Nigerian Petroleum Commissioner in 1977? Muhammadu Buhari. Nigeria has come full circle.

69 2018-12-31 23:50:50 Donna, give it a rest...unless you are responsible for the global decline in oil prices..

72 2018-12-31 23:50:12 It’s really an olive oil stereotype isn’t it?
73 2018-12-31 23:50:10 That sounds promising. I read long thread on fb started by a woman in Florida who had COPD and takes med marijuana via tincture, with THC not just hemp oil. 15 drops 3x a day. Off oxygen, nebulizer, Ventolin, and healed. Company is in Canada. What do you use for copd?
74 2018-12-31 23:50:01 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
75 2018-12-31 23:49:57 Could the Oil get Frolik?
76 2018-12-31 23:49:50 Whale oil beef hooked.
77 2018-12-31 23:49:48 Of course he then launches into $100/barrel oil; totally missing the whole shale oil (& fracked gas) thing. A Big Deal.
btw not watching the whole thing in one sitting. Would be cruel & unusual (for me). Also feel free to mute me. Doing this for my own future reference. 6/

80 2018-12-31 23:49:32 I’m old enough to remember when you were an actual journalist not some make oil salesman who’s new product is propaganda.
81 2018-12-31 23:49:26 Not only are subsidies a fallacy but gov already heavily taxes fuel which in turn makes fuel much more expensive. Name another sector that is taxed as heavily as oil and gas.

87 2018-12-31 23:48:48 He also knows how to accept lots of money from the oil & gas lobby and has a voting record that would make a republican proud on many issues.
88 2018-12-31 23:48:48 My 2019 hopes:

Share and do more art
Try oil painting
Start working out a bit more
Keep a plant alive for at least a month xD
Make and share some music productions in the works
89 2018-12-31 23:48:46 Compact powder: bedaknya bagus, tapi sayang aplikatornya no:/

Lip Ceammate: warnanya bagus2, gak bikin kering di bibir, formulanya enak

Traceless Oil: cleansing oil favoritku, harganya agak mahal untuk isi yang sedikit. Tapi oke buat bersihin wajah.
90 2018-12-31 23:48:43 Why will he complained he can't question military as we all know the rule,oil boom was on point, with the public asset that military regime. I can also remind you of inflation at that time,fuel increment. Don't even talk of OBJ

103 2018-12-31 23:47:16 You @timinmitcham are partially incorrect. Around 72% of fugitive emissions are from Solid Fuels, the rest is from Oil and Natural gas. Have a great day. @DrCraigEmerson @coonavass Cheers.
104 2018-12-31 23:47:14 ZOPP (zero oil price policy) will have major consequences and lead to chaotic price increases in the future (Price Controls historically always have). #HFT
105 2018-12-31 23:47:12 Thanks! Grabbed it at an estate sale this summer. It needs some attention—today it’s just a coat of Murphy Oil Soap. I’ll strip it down and refinish it without any stain before I’m done with it. For now, 150 years or so old, it looks ah’aight. Sturdy as hell!
106 2018-12-31 23:46:43 わかりが深すぎる
107 2018-12-31 23:46:26 And the whole point behind this is that Oil management has and is wrecking their contender status, and the only reason there is still hope is McDavid

114 2018-12-31 23:45:51 Goals for 2019:
1) Become a teen heartthrob 
2) Use the word “obtuse”
3) Get my oil changed
115 2018-12-31 23:45:48 Have you considered a federal incentive to use natural gas rather than coal or oil for electricity production?  It's not just the burning of the dirty coal that will be saved.  The transportation costs and added pollution for coal are also very high.
116 2018-12-31 23:45:40 What's next boiling oil on top the wall to dump on caravans. What 2 million for catapults more old technology. Your worthless crap time to quit
117 2018-12-31 23:45:37 It's simple math, very easy to check.

I've been hearing we will run out of oil my whole life and I'm 58. What is the current projection for running out?

Last you list the petroleum BTUs, it's a simple calculation to convert to watts. Do it, where will it come from, nuclear?

121 2018-12-31 23:45:14 I can see a small population, with a local coal mine or oil well, sustaining as such for generations. Like the Amish with the addition of a tradition of digging for enough of the black rock to run generators. They'd need to stock up on the parts for those, tho.

152 2018-12-31 23:40:54 They sucked out huge profits all year. Now they’re crying that the price of oil is down (that’s good for consumers), that China might be a problem, that the Syria pullout is bad for businesses. The sky is falling! The sky is falling. Ridiculous
153 2018-12-31 23:40:54 Looking like you smell like a fresh batch of coconut oil

155 2018-12-31 23:40:48 Yasir Latif Hamid, is another vile, vile, phoney liberal, who uses Jinnah's name to sell his snake oil of anti-Pakistanism, seeking refuge in his self-declared patriotism whenever he is confronted for his views. An illiberal champion of free speech who blocks those who disagree

157 2018-12-31 23:40:31 マテウス、あのおねーさんよくね？
158 2018-12-31 23:40:26 Getting rid of Trump isn't the only goal. If that's your only goal, you deserve this fouled up country. How are we going to undo all the damage with another Big Oil, Big Pharma, Military Industrial Complex-loving status quo Neoliberal like Beto, Biden, Harris, Booker, etc.?

164 2018-12-31 23:39:59 I was running in a convoy with oil dispersion chemicals from 'up Norf' when the TORREY CANYON.

Police escort from the M1 through London and there was a street marker down near Marble Arch must have been 22-15 vehicles rolled on their sides by police and fire brigade. # surreal

171 2018-12-31 23:38:48 Calfrac Well Services, $CFW.CA/$CFW.TO, had a nice run today up a nice 4.27%.  This one definitely has some legs.  We need a nice run into earnings and then watch out!  #OOTT #Oil #Trading

175 2018-12-31 23:38:26 Dear Representative, a primary tenet of restorative justice is to involve the offender in helping to make things right. While the oil and gas industry shouldn't run the show, they should definitely have a seat at the table when looking for solutions.
176 2018-12-31 23:38:22 ひぇ……色々と気を付けてね…
177 2018-12-31 23:38:21 Dang, how you gonna do Cady like that?  Oil and Water/Crying Game is amazing and she’s been putting stuff on SoundCloud.

179 2018-12-31 23:38:02 Chris, AB already refines more oil than what we need and has recently built the first new refinery in NA in 20 years (sturgeon) regardless still pipelines to transport gas, oil or dilbit...
180 2018-12-31 23:38:01 Who makes the immigration laws?! That’s not the POTUS, he’s just trying to enforce the crappy laws y’all made! You’re a shameless snake oil salesman, Bernie Sanders! #BuildTheWall #SchumerShutdown!
181 2018-12-31 23:37:56 The ones for rats? Some glue traps you can just put oil on and it'll release whatever's stuck. I prefer that over any of the killing traps
182 2018-12-31 23:37:47 Sorry, but the cause this time is the American shale revolution. Whereas we once depended on the US market it is clearly no longer fruitful for us. Who caused the shale revolution? The oil industry. The pipeline companies (in competition with each other) jockeyed for position. /2
183 2018-12-31 23:37:43 Got one of those migraine oil sticks from amazon. And the shit is actually working
184 2018-12-31 23:37:41 むり はあ 攻め度が高い
185 2018-12-31 23:37:31 Jointly, OPEC and Russia produce more than 50% of the world’s oil. They have significant pricing power if they manage to maintain discipline. I expect they will do so given the positive results from the previous production cuts, "
186 2018-12-31 23:37:26 The new oil i got for Rys hair smells so good
187 2018-12-31 23:37:22 Can't find lard in the grocery store anymore.  So, we cook with olive oil.  Makes me wonder though, we trying to eat healthier, but my folks died at 90 and they ate lard everyday.

193 2018-12-31 23:37:10 And oil prices are down 25%, too.

Trump stripped regulations to increase US energy production and pressed OPEC for lower prices since he is Putin's puppet.

199 2018-12-31 23:36:27 Agreed. That seems pretty shady to me. We usually get our oil changed at a local place, too.
200 2018-12-31 23:36:20 The old Dem party isn't what they said they were

As long as they keep getting a big dollar from oil & gas they will tell ppl they are for #GreenNewDeal but won't lift a finger to help

Don't be Dishearten 2020 is coming & more allies will Be joining the Party #TrueProgressive
201 2018-12-31 23:36:05 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
202 2018-12-31 23:35:43 Real progressives aren't afraid of higher taxes in trade for lower cost single payer nonprofit healthcare and college costs. Nor are we opposed to nationalizing big oil, utility companies, etc.
203 2018-12-31 23:35:29 Obama promised: 
- oil consumpt. reduced by 35%
- stabilize path to citizenship
- new rules for revolving door Whitehouse lobbyists
- cut fam h/c to $2500/yr per (his biggest campaign promise never even came close)
- close Guantanamo
The list goes on...
It’s politics, move on.
204 2018-12-31 23:35:27 But past busts caused by low oil prices IMO anyway and they accept this. Granted prices are down but again IMO govt policies and we'll financed opposition by vocal minority are causing this problem #cdnpoli

215 2018-12-31 23:34:27 My wife has just battled pancreatic cancer for the second time in 2 years,her tumor markers were climbing until we started cannabis oil and then they dropped by 90% over 3 months to normal range,we now keep up a maintenance dose for protection against it's return,it works people
216 2018-12-31 23:34:19 I once paid $1.40/L for gas. I don’t know what these oil and gas types are complaining about
217 2018-12-31 23:34:16 Oh wow, meta analysis accepted by the NHS as showing peppermint oil is effective for relieving IBS.

That one's going in my spellbook.
218 2018-12-31 23:34:14 No Sir!

223 2018-12-31 23:34:02 as some of you know i've been researching holistic practices and basically natural living. i have major sinus issues especially when it rains like it has in my area. i put three drops of peppermint essential oil, one drop of orange, one drop of lavender, and one drop of orange in
224 2018-12-31 23:34:01 Whilst twitter discussions see snake oil salesmen trying to muddy the concepts of  gto, exploitation and solvers, in the waters of philosophy. It is refreshing to see here, that the majority still recognise solvers as the future.
225 2018-12-31 23:34:00 NYE Celebration Tip

Slowly massage coconut oil over every inch of her body then pop confetti with the girl she just met
226 2018-12-31 23:33:55 Pretty sure that a bottle of any of these oils - coconut, argan, jojoba, grapeseed, castor oil - is SLIGHTLY cheaper than this "paint work".
227 2018-12-31 23:33:54 I’m on the Chinatown bus but I’m covered in body oil 
SMELLING BETTER THAN THE OPPS
Word to @TASH__P
228 2018-12-31 23:33:34 Toothbrush reminds me of that Tv programme--Never Mind the BUZZZZZZ Cocks!!
229 2018-12-31 23:33:23 Each is a discard power, so you can only get one benefit from taking an action with that card. For Solarium, you will need to discard another card if you have already discarded Snake Oil to get its reward. But, y'know, it's New Year's, so if you're already drunk, you get both.
230 2018-12-31 23:33:14 I'm interested in $XOM but I thinking their next earnings call will be weak because of low oil prices, might wait and see if it gets cheaper

234 2018-12-31 23:32:33 To the extent we can:
Small holders are very welcome and crop rotation is smart

We have to accept SOME monoculture just like we have to accept oil & fossil fuel 

Nothing is perfect 
There are tradeoffs

Huge diary make little sense but not practical to grow trees on a few acres
235 2018-12-31 23:32:31 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
236 2018-12-31 23:32:27 Well I set the oil on fire when I made mine, so you're... wait, how are we scoring this?
237 2018-12-31 23:32:16 He doesn’t. They just hit the OFF switch. Then they clean & lube him, including an oil change.
238 2018-12-31 23:32:15 Anyone else’s mom put baby oil in their hair when they were a kid or was it just my mom
239 2018-12-31 23:31:56 I mean it's correct if you like soggy bread.  PB contains peanut oil which prevents your bred from soaking in the liquid in jelly leaving your bread perfect.  It's science.

255 2018-12-31 23:30:06 Hey Trump, where are the Mexican pesos to pay for the wall? Your a con artist extraordinaire. A snake oil salesman. Mueller's sharpening his incisive report that's going to tear you into smithereens.
256 2018-12-31 23:29:58 Avocado is excellent for your hair. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Natural Aloe Vera is good for your scalp. Is it NISIM or NHB? slows hair loss. or analogous. What must I do to pin down the official portal. Hope to find it. Where to find it?

265 2018-12-31 23:29:08 Precisely! You have to remember the roots of the like of the Clinton/Obama/BushxX2.  They were/are all tarred in with the same Communistic bent (Avarice).  Whatever the war they started had something to do with Natural Resources. Oil/Uranium/Gas/Water. The world to ransom!

272 2018-12-31 23:27:32 Well, let's be even more specific.  We need an ambitious plan to unleash Canada's extremely powerful and hugely rewarding natural resource sector.  If we do not, we become a third world country - like Venezuela, the country with the worlds largest know oil and gas reserves.
273 2018-12-31 23:27:19 I was about to spend $30 on hair growth oil and forgot my girl @daniyooo_ got it for the low
274 2018-12-31 23:27:18 That’s the plan. Cast iron with some canola oil and some butter and a smashed clove of garlic.
275 2018-12-31 23:27:08 poor old Wendy best keep still.
276 2018-12-31 23:26:59 Very true, thank you

Oh, while you're here. Could you please support the Green New Deal and bar those who have accepted gas and oil money from being on the climate change committee?
277 2018-12-31 23:26:59 It is easy to imagine a pseudo-religious cult of fossil fuels users insisting on maintaining that way of life as the rest of technology passes them by -- like the Amish, but still burning coal and oil for electricity when the world has graduated on to other means.
278 2018-12-31 23:26:57 How is there 20 other big oil exporters that are better than Canada? I would guess Norway but really 19 others......
279 2018-12-31 23:26:51 Green jobs already outnumber coal jobs by a very significant multiple. Catching up to nat gas and oil jobs as well.
Your statement is false
280 2018-12-31 23:26:30 Oil,Perfume Make The Heart Glad So A Mans Counsel Is Sweet To His Friend..Faithful Are The Words Of A Friend,Deceitful Are The Kisses Of An Enemy..A Fool Always Loses His Temper,A Wise Man Holds It Back..Men Of Bloodshed Hate The Blameless But The Upright Are Concerned For Him.

287 2018-12-31 23:26:02 1:1 THC/CBD oil = best medication so far.
288 2018-12-31 23:25:52 I ain’t have a drop of oil in there I thought the air substitutes for the oil

290 2018-12-31 23:25:45 Oil is where it is in the industrial food chain is because it stores chemical energy.  That energy, when release in the form of combustion, returns about 25-35x the energy it took to obtain it from the Earth.  All energy sources cost energy to obtain, the ratio is the gain.

294 2018-12-31 23:25:09 Lol this reminds me of licking my thumb when younger and rubbing the cracks in between fingers, get a real wash like I got oil. And 3yrs
295 2018-12-31 23:25:08 I seem to remember I was laughing so much that I walloped on the carpet....
296 2018-12-31 23:24:57 Aveeno, jergens, a lil bit of organic coconut oil every now and then :) it’s a great “shaving cream” too
297 2018-12-31 23:24:56 Thank you. I do have a shower and an oil filled radiator thank goodness xx
298 2018-12-31 23:24:55 @ezralevant has been saying this for years. Even wrote a book about Ethical Oil. But, you know, he’s so racist.
299 2018-12-31 23:24:48 Better not meet up then!!
300 2018-12-31 23:24:46 Outgoing #Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper. True, he is Mr. Oil-and-Gas, but our state experienced unprecedented prosperity under his 8-year watch. Warren is most effective as Senate gadfly but we need a moderate to win the Oval Office.
301 2018-12-31 23:24:45 Maybe blue or red if they ever try to do another one? Green and purple were pretty iconic and black would just remind me of the oil from the X-Files... hmm 
302 2018-12-31 23:24:43 2/ Most of the job-losses happened in 2015 after the mid-2014 oil price drop. Mr. Harper did nothing whereas the current government offered EI and other benefits retroactive to January 1, 2015 - or nine months before Mr. Harper left office. They are dupes of UCP/CPC quasi-PACs.
303 2018-12-31 23:24:37 I’m the queen of getting oil stains on my shirts. Every. Single. One. Right on the boobs.

306 2018-12-31 23:24:24 man i need sum oil whea it’s at!
307 2018-12-31 23:24:15 So what is Scotland's massively overestimated oil wealth this week? How many more pretendy billions is the non shiny wealth worth?

310 2018-12-31 23:24:02 CO2 tax scheme is snake oil being peddled by the current administration.  Needed to pay down sky-rocketing debt, and not a cent will go to meaningful transition to other energy sources.  The refund cheque is the bait; won't begin to cover the rise in price of all goods/services.
311 2018-12-31 23:24:02 It's not to do with your toothbrush ?
312 2018-12-31 23:23:54 Snake oil anyone?????
313 2018-12-31 23:23:46 But did you get a good connection ???
314 2018-12-31 23:23:45 Gotta Bring The New Year In On That Oil
315 2018-12-31 23:23:34 Both car lots I’ve worked at contradict your statement.

The first did free car washes, free oil top-offs and had a very customer friendly waiting room with amenities. The current does free hand-washes and encourages people to stop by & chat.
316 2018-12-31 23:23:31 I use tea tree oil topically when I get a blemish (which is rare nowadays), but other than that, nothing. What is your opinion on this?

321 2018-12-31 23:23:06 Well, that's what it's like in a boom and bust economy. It's not like there's no history of it in Alberta. Why are they fomenting against the federal government when most of the job-losses were caused by the oil industry itself. /2

323 2018-12-31 23:22:50 It’s not even that - at least oil is cost effective. Solar is just grift.
324 2018-12-31 23:22:49 You'll still pressure yourself nonetheless. The not giving a fuck part comes from knowing all that pressure is unnecessary.
325 2018-12-31 23:22:45 I have--but then again i think I am getting too old for that.
326 2018-12-31 23:22:42 Yes, plus oil types in Calg acting out as wannabes to mimic and gain approval from their Texas (and similar) overlords and masters.
327 2018-12-31 23:22:26 Doctors and medication never worked for me. What did was really simple: fish oil and 30 minutes on the treadmill five days a week. If I skip either the darkness comes creeping back.

I'm sorry to say but the Philippines has no bright future ahead.
331 2018-12-31 23:21:50 There are quite a few producers of rapeseed oil, it's terribly fashionable.

335 2018-12-31 23:21:33 poor city of champs....not..Watching #EP40 score on them reminded me of the Sedien dominance over the Oil. I hope he rips it up on them like Gretz killed us.
336 2018-12-31 23:21:27 She is strong on economic fundamentals and is not beholden to big money interests like Wall Street, Big Pharma and Big Oil. I don't know if I will support her yet but she is a smart women who will fight for regular working people. #ElizabethWarren #elizabethwarren2020
337 2018-12-31 23:21:27 Because Educated people don't become voters for republicans nore do they become canon fodder in their oil wars.
338 2018-12-31 23:21:21 I used a little olive oil and Traeger’s Coffee Rub. After it gets out of the Sous Vide I’ll season it with fresh rosemary and more dry rub before sticking it in the oven for 15 mins to form a crust
339 2018-12-31 23:21:20 Right...a green new deal would just replace an oil oligopoly with a solar oligopoly.

> assumes the wrong reasons

No, it assumes we aren't omniscient and learn from new insights

Your motivations are beginning to show.

I'd pay 25 billion to deter a mass extinction.

> naive to think

How profitable are those oil companies anyway?
342 2018-12-31 23:21:04 Just keep using the same oil. What's the worst that could happen?

344 2018-12-31 23:20:50 I'm a severe migraine sufferer. I've tried literally everything even Botox injected into my skull & the bk of my neck. I've heard CBD oil(?) can be rubbed on ur forehead as prevention? I don't like smoking weed, my gf goes 2 new Dispensary & I've tried it, made me tired & sick.
345 2018-12-31 23:20:37 I’m making lamb chops Scotta Dita, cannellini beans heated in olive oil, garlic and rosemary and a salad. Ah, and a cocktail that is yet to be determined. You?

352 2018-12-31 23:20:07 This is why republicans are not suited to be leaders. White man can’t face the fact that the world they created - the putrid oil, the polluted waste of industry, the disregard for the earth - is destroying the world. Better, smarter, cleaner, more humane options must be found.

As faith is applied to this prayer, there is an expectation of God's power pouring out

377 2018-12-31 23:18:17 Just took a long, soaking bath which contained a very liberal amount of body oil. When I got out, I had so much oil sticking to me that if I had dusted myself with flour and stepped into a dry sauna, I would have become the Gina version of oven-fried chicken quite quickly.

379 2018-12-31 23:18:11 Try something very constructive. Like for instance I clean my bedroom so it’s very pleasant all the way down to clean sheets, dusted furniture, oil diffuser on for all the senses.

440 2018-12-31 23:10:12 Because mostly, Arab countries are rich in oil. That's why they're slavin' away and still taking the pass

467 2018-12-31 23:07:48 When you get to Congress take a poll and see if you can get fellow members to pledge they will not accept money from big oil and coal and divest from them if they own stocks. Start with a few to start a coalition.
468 2018-12-31 23:07:39 Because they'll do it same way that Uber, Big Oil, Apple, Google, and other serial tax avoiders operating in NZ do?
469 2018-12-31 23:07:37 This is done by taking the plastic that is currently polluting the environment as both sourcing the raw material (oil) and and final products (that we see polluting the ocean), and to put that recycled plastic into meaningful long term products.

488 2018-12-31 23:04:32 I worked in the oil and gas industry in Texas back in the 1990s when the four-beer lunch was certainly a thing.
489 2018-12-31 23:04:30 My main goals for this year is to get better at oil painting, and have a healthier way of living! What's yours?
490 2018-12-31 23:04:30 Wrong!!!! Has nothing to do with Cap and Trade! According to Reuters, oil prices dropped to their lowest price of the year over worries of another GLOBAL SUPPLY GLUT, and the outlook for energy demand after another increase to interest rates, oil prices fell more than 4-percent.
491 2018-12-31 23:04:28 Did you even think about this before you tweeted it? "There’s more oil now than there was 40 years ago and in 10 years there will be even more."
Such a self evidently absurd statement I don't even know where to begin.
492 2018-12-31 23:04:20 To be fair they may have been back so don’t quote me as he’s out
When they fitted it they refused to commission as it would have took too much oil and helps delivery was a further 2 weeks (summer so no probs)
They have prob been back once it was filled

498 2018-12-31 23:03:15 I would still do it, if I could only shower.
I would just the ingredients one by one.
I would exfoliate with the baking soda.
Use a few drops of essential oils in a carrier oil, not directly on my skin.
I'd still speak my affirmations out loud.

511 2018-12-31 23:02:13 There is a scientific consensus that warming is being caused by human activities. The people who are trying to keep themselves rich are the oil executives. Who gets into climate science out of greed?

538 2018-12-31 23:00:48 So  you solution is to sell more oil  dirt cheap so you can make half of what you use to get years ago. The issue is the price. Not flow. Even if Energy East was built Trans Canada claimed they don't have the ships to get it to markets in Europe.

573 2018-12-31 22:57:50 I don’t understand why we don’t just refine our own oil right here. Do it right in Alberta.  We used to do much more refining in Canada. It’s time we got back to doing it again.  No pipeline required if you do it right at the source in Alberta.

582 2018-12-31 22:57:13 i absolutely hate the eco styler black castor oil and flaxseed gel .
583 2018-12-31 22:56:53 Yeah, you gotta keep that oil pumping regardless of genocide.
584 2018-12-31 22:56:44 That would be an easy win for Trump. She threw sex workers under the bus by proposing End Banking for Human Traffickers Act with Mark Rubio... Plus she's a grandstanding trash. Where was she when Native Americans were protesting the "oil police" in North Dakota? Problematic
585 2018-12-31 22:56:32 That is a sweet chinese made type 56 but it needs a good oil bath.
586 2018-12-31 22:56:24 In a few minutes my Mom would kick my door in and pour anointing oil on my head, while I pretend to sleep.
587 2018-12-31 22:56:23 Yes mate 
Oil fired. 
Engineers wouldn’t fully commission when it was fitted as they wouldn’t put “that much oil in” ( not sure if they’ve been back).
Sinks (3) ok.
All taps run hot
Water cools as it’s run for  a while even if the flow is slowed at the tap
The bath is a no no!!
588 2018-12-31 22:56:11 No doubt the engine oil and other non-value materials where dumped in the ocean.
589 2018-12-31 22:56:11 Your back didn’t let you.. but you can be a laborer in an oil field. Ok!?! 
590 2018-12-31 22:55:58 Someone just called asking if we sell CBD oil like bitch I WISH
591 2018-12-31 22:55:24 I make infused coconut oil. But the nephew has set me up with a distalette so gonna learn how to work with that.
592 2018-12-31 22:55:15 Apparently different opinions, facts, hats, t-shirts, confirmation hearings, leaving wars , lowering taxes, low unemployment, oil, and laws do too. You weren't the crazy lady clawing at the doors of the Supreme Court? Your ilk.
593 2018-12-31 22:55:12 Leave it up to me to come get an oil change 6 minutes before these people close 
594 2018-12-31 22:55:12 Also, exactly zero percent of US oil comes from Syria. You have zero understanding of what youre talking about.
595 2018-12-31 22:55:02 Y’all why I almost forgot to get my oil changed! Thankfully they’re open till 5 
596 2018-12-31 22:54:34 CBD oil, the non-intoxicating component of medical cannabis, is worth consideration as well. Neuroprotective and neuroregenerative.
597 2018-12-31 22:54:29 It's snake oil to tell people to eat healthier and get more sleep? Where does the profit come from?

604 2018-12-31 22:52:55 Okay I wasn’t expecting this 
605 2018-12-31 22:52:51 My hands spend a great majority of the time covered in dirt, diesel, oil, blood, & animal hair... and I’m ok with that.

607 2018-12-31 22:52:48 Climate change is fact. There off, The over-use of non-renewable resources – oil, coal and natural gas – leads to a continuous increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which, in turn, raises the temperature. There in, unwise human activity.”

624 2018-12-31 22:51:13 They are full of it! They just want to tax people for carbon. The use of oil,gas,coal will stay the same. 
So we are suppose to believe that by paying more taxes, it's going to fix what isn't broke to start with.? It's not hard to look at historical weather and realize no change

627 2018-12-31 22:51:05 You don't really need as much oil as that recipe calls for. I just eyeball everything now cause I make it so much. You'll get the hang of it fast. Should definitely work with any fresh peppers, but keep in mind it skews milder than the peppers actually are.

642 2018-12-31 22:49:21 That's the spray. It's not the oil. The oil had the wand.
643 2018-12-31 22:49:20 Listing me among this amazing people... wow, thank you  God bless you.
644 2018-12-31 22:49:18 Wow - so generous to spill oil to help local economies. Maybe instead of spilling and wasting oil & hurting the environmen, just donate  direct to the communities ?

653 2018-12-31 22:48:22 @JoeVargas do you only have the oil for pets or do you have cbd treats? The dogs are not having these firecrackers!!

656 2018-12-31 22:47:49 That the best oil analysts have failed in their forecast has to make us rethink if it is possible to invest in oil.

662 2018-12-31 22:47:29 If you guys could just put a little banner at the bottom of every show / article that says, "paid for by big oil and the military industrial complex," I think that would clear up a lot of confusion for most people.
663 2018-12-31 22:47:29 Stop giving Silicon Valley ideas!
664 2018-12-31 22:47:22 It’s an oil you use on your face before putting foundation on! It’s really nice I have a similar one. However if you have greasy skin I would not recommend
665 2018-12-31 22:47:06 Oh yum that looks heavenly. I assumed there was a ton of oil in there. Curious to try it with poblano subbed in, too. Been cooking like crazy with those lately

678 2018-12-31 22:45:31 I agree, but maybe by cutting it down with the grapeseed oil, it won't overpower the cornbread. Or maybe it will and it will  be delightful ;-)

691 2018-12-31 22:43:36 Yes really hope so too - my fear Bernier will split the vote.   Ont watched our manufacturing jobs all run south thanks to libs 'green energy' Took too long to dump them. Must push for pipelines. Canada has to realize oil & gas sale is good for Alta & rest of Canada
692 2018-12-31 22:43:25 And workers everywhere, especially low income workers, will feel the worst affects of climate change catastrophe that oil industry causes
693 2018-12-31 22:43:24 Thomas Frank said it years ago: we need a Manhattan Project to free ourselves from oil. This could be it. Jobs! That can't be outsourced! Scientific research! Competition!
694 2018-12-31 22:43:12 And when you define "fossil fuel money" like the David Sirotas of the world do, "taking money from anyone peripherally involved with or employed by 'big oil'" you're really going to have a hard time finding Green Committee members.

699 2018-12-31 22:42:37 Testing, and no care for the environmental impact. The world economy is built around oil and weapons. It can’t last. We will see if we outlive it or no as a species. My hopes are not high.
700 2018-12-31 22:42:31 I’ve tried antibiotics, ear irrigation, and Mullein Garlic oil to clear my ear congestion but I’m convinced that ultimately what did it was the harmonica part in Visions of Johanna by Bob Dylan. Thanks, Bob!
701 2018-12-31 22:42:14 THIS! Justin (a so called Christian) is happy to continue to negatively affect the health US citizens and the planet (given by God he should believe). Green jobs are a huge opportunity which make me suspect he has shares in big oil.
702 2018-12-31 22:42:06 Whoever took my sandwich, I hope you realize it has hot chili oil mixed into the tuna salad.

709 2018-12-31 22:41:30 Those “individuals” were all top oil execs and gave the maximum amount available for individual donations. That’s coordinated effort.

715 2018-12-31 22:40:44 You mean like the supreme snake oil salesman 45 he beats out all of congress and every American citizen in that department
716 2018-12-31 22:40:41 Do you check ur oil?
717 2018-12-31 22:40:31 So while I WANT this to be true, I’ll remain skeptical. And for your information, right wingers have no life for oil, at all, but right wingers just like anyone, want cheap efficient energy, so that they have money left over to support their families.
718 2018-12-31 22:40:30 It's like craft color papers, color pencils, charcoal pens, acrylics, oil pastels, chalk pastels, erasers, and water color stuffs. I'm just now realizing there's something fundamentally at odds with a minimalist lifestyle and an artistic lifestyle
719 2018-12-31 22:40:24 Canada is largely a resource nation.  Oil. Gas. Mining. Forestry, etc.  which most other industries also rely on, feed off and build on.  O&G has already been targeted...what will be next?  The willingness to sacrifice on a whim shakes confidence across the board.

723 2018-12-31 22:39:59 How are you factoring sewage in waterways in Victoria and Quebec.  How do you profess to care about the environment but ignore this? How do you ignore imported oil and it's foot print. You and the policy punishes Canadian producers.

729 2018-12-31 22:39:08 The actual bone ones need to be seasoned in oil for awhile.  I did 48 hours last time and then let it set for a week.  If you were using it for archival work I wouldn't want to scent one.  But I have done that for ones O do crafts with.  Old school is to keep oiled by rubbing

738 2018-12-31 22:36:45 Thankful that neither of you use oil or natural gas so that you can speak with integrity when you bash your enemies to the east. That is what it is becoming after all, us vs them. It will be a fun few years watching Canada disintegrate.  Glad to have you all play along.

742 2018-12-31 22:35:36 The ratio of oil to flour. I find 1:1.5 or even 1:2 oil to flour makes a silkier roux
743 2018-12-31 22:35:29 Like virtually "Elite" Socialists, the Elite live like kings while the rest are peons.
Everywhere socialism has been implemented this is the normal result. Worked in numerous Socialist countries drilling oil wells. Ask someone who has been there & knows not idiot college kids.

754 2018-12-31 22:33:56 What a load of  propaganda hogwash. The downturn in world oil prices is the problem. Same amount of oil is flowing 24/7 since the Harper days. Just way cheaper.  The economy is doing great. It's Harper leftovers that a deliberately dividing the country.

757 2018-12-31 22:33:29 I know right ! that is what I was  saying  - AB needs a plan B for all its workers and not in oil !
758 2018-12-31 22:32:25 Hilarious. One might give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they’re taking a stand against spot reduction and other BS? Nope. FB will let anyone advertise snake oil. God forbid a legitimate service includes a picture of someone’s abs tho

Hillary refused to consider single payer, we wanted it,
Hillary insisted 12 bucks an hour was as high as minimum wage could go,
Hillary defended the oil workers at Standing Rock,
Hillary wanted dog fights over Syria and TPP.

775 2018-12-31 22:30:09 Now u need to pour oil all over you...!
776 2018-12-31 22:29:44 Okay then. Thanks so much! I might use a combo of the bacon grease and grapeseed oil...I'll let you know if I make anybody sick.
777 2018-12-31 22:29:24 Let me know when women are equally represented in jobs with the highest rate of injury and death. Mining, power line technician, commercial fishing, oil rig work, you know.  Stuff like that.

779 2018-12-31 22:28:49 you ever uhh almost put lube in your hair instead of hair oil? Just me? Okay cool
780 2018-12-31 22:28:41 I have even used coconut oil. It's really not that important. It's to grease the skillet and the hot mix is to heat the batter from the inside.

Go ahead and try what you have. I use the Martha White because it's self rising & I'm too lazy to mix the other stuff in.

787 2018-12-31 22:27:21 Wait. It was one *drop* of cbd oil? Not the whole dropper...? Um. K. I had two.

See you guys later. Hopefully chilled out as fuck.
788 2018-12-31 22:27:08 I also don’t think that demonizing blue-collar workers from largely rural parts of the country that depend on employment in the oil industry is a good strategy. There needs to be a better message or the current climate denier in the White House will win again.
789 2018-12-31 22:27:06 @SecretaryPerry so i hear your in bed with big coal and oil  you do not believe in solar or wind power the energy of the future if it was up to you the country would be one big coal mine the problem is big coal and oil have you there pocket you say the public be damed

Can I get in as an amatuer nerd? My #OilPriceBet for Brent 12/31/2019 is $64.20/barrel.  Will be a slight recovery but a weak economy & Trump's fear of raising oil prices by enforcing sanctions against Iran will keep oil prices relatively weak. And dumb pot joke.

806 2018-12-31 22:23:40 Actually, I can attest to this. I just for some reason am attracted to men who couldnt fight their way out of a wet paper bag. And then I'm disappointed because I end up being the 'man' in the relationship, changing oil and taking care of spiders...

- Improve oil painting 
- Draw different subject matter
- Sketch more
- Develop my OCs

820 2018-12-31 22:21:31 That doesn’t make sense, you’re talking about cheap, reusable energy; that type of demand already exists. You don’t need to create that kind of demand. People will happily switch out of gas/oil, if it is cheaper and efficient.
821 2018-12-31 22:21:28 Those are just a few corrections. Another correction-@AOC is a "social democrat" because she does not support dismantling capitalism. I fully support her but I'm a real "democratic socialist" because I want:
-nationalization of pharmasuticals
-eliminate oil entirely by 2025
-UBI

866 2018-12-31 22:15:54 This is an oil pattern and lane condition that Don Carter, Dick Weber and Carmen Salvino would dominate.
867 2018-12-31 22:15:39 Dems list include effects of oil & gas drilling in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge & conflicts of interest of Interior officials writing rules to expedite energy production on federal land & waters
oversight will include public health & climate change effects of Trump’s decisions
868 2018-12-31 22:15:39 Kicking (returning or doing the act) and Mizzou mix like water and oil
869 2018-12-31 22:15:35 Alhamdulillah.
870 2018-12-31 22:15:33 So long story short what Canada can do to lower emissions around the world. Invest money into helping manufacturers make their engines more efficient. Put a minimum efficiency rating % for all new vehicles. And also PLEASE inspect your car for oil leaks and get them repaired.
871 2018-12-31 22:15:32 Justin Trudeau, boiled in oil.
872 2018-12-31 22:15:01 This must be that black seed oil everybody is talking about?
873 2018-12-31 22:14:52 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
874 2018-12-31 22:14:51 My son is woke AF. Just shunned a Nutella filled churro because of palm oil. He’s 11. Where the hell he getting it from?
875 2018-12-31 22:14:46 No idea, either way it's funny. Kinda like the one video of a girl pouring oil all over her BMW's engine. lol
876 2018-12-31 22:14:45 “Oh, you did?”

Now that he thought about it, he probably passed out on the couch before he could welcome him home. He would’ve liked to come with him if he went out grocery shopping... Next time!

Soon, the fire was on, the pan was heating up, and oil was being poured. +
877 2018-12-31 22:14:42 I kept putting off getting a oil change, I get in my car and my daddy went got one for me 
878 2018-12-31 22:14:40 Recently discovered @RealJeffHoliday's videos debunking pseudoscience, and it is both entertaining and infuriating.

Entertaining videos.

Infuriating Snake Oil Salespeople.
879 2018-12-31 22:14:35 Dressing candles with rose water, eucalyptus leaves, sage, mugwort, dried rose petals, chamomile, inscense, frankincense oil, and Florida water while cooking a pot of collards and black eye peas and listening to Kate Bush. Feeling v. reading for 2019.
880 2018-12-31 22:14:23 I miss writing about oil and gas.

883 2018-12-31 22:14:16 @T8_888_car Happy New Year. Hope you didnt have too much of that special oil.
884 2018-12-31 22:14:09 Olive oil over everything
885 2018-12-31 22:14:08 HAHAHA you did not just say that. Go put on your #MAGA hat and GTFO. Not one, again NOT ONE war is for the US. They're for the private interests that reside in the country,most notably big oil.
886 2018-12-31 22:13:52 Letting Russia regain its Soviet sphere of influence, China building military islands in the South China Sea for oil grab, weird 1988 style propaganda... thinking the Military Industrial Complex is just trying to keep global conflict for war profiteering.
887 2018-12-31 22:13:27 Wow
888 2018-12-31 22:13:24 &provide 4 those who grieve in Zion -2 bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, & a garment of praise instead of a spirit if despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD 4the display of his splendor.
889 2018-12-31 22:13:22 IKR?? it removes the oil on the surface so the polish really sticks. just make sure when you switch back to bare nails to rub some vitamin e or oil back into the nail to replenish!
890 2018-12-31 22:13:13 Thought them cooking it in peanut oil would affect me
891 2018-12-31 22:13:12 Every centrist is that way. On the hot mic, Hillary said that she's centrist, that Bernie may beat her. Bc "kids in their basements" (verbatim quote?) buy his snake oil. They have no life & "becoming a revolutionary is seductive."
892 2018-12-31 22:12:48 @RuffHouseStudio can you please make a video showing and explaining how to make edibles for recipes that doesn't  require butter or oil?
893 2018-12-31 22:12:40 Starting off NYE great sitting in pep boys for over an hour for a simple oil change 
894 2018-12-31 22:12:40 Icebergs are woke, they fuck up the oil industry.
895 2018-12-31 22:12:33 @Oil_Guns_Merica she’s gunning for your job
896 2018-12-31 22:12:26 you disagree with 

"....Mandel said Alberta needs to do a better job of  marketing its oil sector & change the tone of the discussion to highlight the industry’s environmental strides around carbon intensity  and reduction, regulations, & tailings pond innovations & clean up."?
897 2018-12-31 22:12:24 FUCKING HEATED. Literally just went off on the mechanic here because he fucked me into a full synthetic oil change literally told him I know what is recommended and what I need and the only reason I’m here is cause my dads dead and can’t do it for me! Next time I’ll do it myself!
898 2018-12-31 22:12:02 Energy in vs energy out.  Solar and wind are at about 5-8x and nuclear power is at 60-70x.  Meaning that 17-20% of all human activity would be required to just build panels and wind turbines if we had no oil, but with nuclear that is only 3-4%.  Vastly more efficient.
899 2018-12-31 22:11:57 Meanwhile in the US ... I woke up with the cold-from-hell this morning. Today has been tea, tea, tea, Oregano Oil, tea, ViraClear, tea, Vitamin C, tea, tea, tea. And I’ve used up half the tissue box.
900 2018-12-31 22:11:54 Apple cider vinegar, coconut oil, turmeric, and hot water....a great start for every morning.
901 2018-12-31 22:11:34 I started this year 2018 with so much excitements , great things happened during the year and few days to the new year 2019, i got a news that shattered everything.... but i know God will see me through and give me beauty for my ashes and oil of gladness for my mourning.
902 2018-12-31 22:11:30 "That is neither a no, not a deterrent," she smiled wickedly and pressed her finger slowly into his hole, careful not to hurt him. Spit wasn't a great replacement for proper oil, but it would do for this.
903 2018-12-31 22:11:27 I'm female and was hired to work in mining (oil and gas) specifically because of the employer's belief that women are more health and safety conscious. I watched, first hand, as too many of my male co-workers acted macho and took unnecessary risks in order to impress their pals.
904 2018-12-31 22:11:24 Probably don't like olive oil chucked all over every dish including there apple crumble and custard 
905 2018-12-31 22:11:20 Kad dai ki falla masa

907 2018-12-31 22:11:06 i mean i guess it'd be attending taylor swift's reputation stadium tour at lucas oil stadium but i also enjoyed the joint purchase of a playstation 4 and nnk ii: revenant kingdom this year
908 2018-12-31 22:10:51 If she thinks the heads of all these oil and gas companies are going to just bend to her - I think she's in for a rude awakening!
909 2018-12-31 22:10:41 This posture changing rhetoric switching and basic full throated lying will always fool the miserable deplorable snake oil loving Magats. Thank you Joe for not swallowing this BS and Thank You Nancy and Chuck for standing up to the tyrant. Enough! No more!
910 2018-12-31 22:10:37 My first off farm job was at a truckstop as a gas jockey up north. In those days we checked oil, belts, tires washed windshields inside and out as well as all lights. Oh ya and sold girly mags and whiskey from back room.
911 2018-12-31 22:10:31 Skim your menudo and pozole fam! I see lots of oil slicks in those pix #TeamPozole #TeamWhiteMenudo
912 2018-12-31 22:10:29 so, the alternative is crypto (where you have no bias or interest) or communism… I thought you were some kind of interesting crypto head, you are borderline a snake oil salesman 
913 2018-12-31 22:10:25 I got my oil changed by myself today so now I’m actually an adult (and my dad can stop reminding me to get my oil changed for the next 3 months)

917 2018-12-31 22:10:03 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
918 2018-12-31 22:09:56 The answer really is, tax the fuck out of the oil industry for the use of our troops or decide that the flow of oil from those areas are not in our nation’s interest. I see a lot of idle wells in Oklahoma.
919 2018-12-31 22:09:50 Corwin is farm to table.  

I once made mayonnaise from scratch, because I wanted an egg-free olive oil mayo.

It was good, but it has a shelf life of three days and I don't normally use a quart of mayo fast.
920 2018-12-31 22:09:39 one could use the oil in it to make french fries HA HA HA
921 2018-12-31 22:09:29 Serum before moisturizer. (Is the “serum” an oil?)
The exfoliating product should tell you how long to leave it on. Don’t scrub tho.
922 2018-12-31 22:08:46 I'm getting my oil changed and there is a live rat in my engine 
923 2018-12-31 22:08:45 I believe that you’re wrong
Insinuating they hold the bomb

924 2018-12-31 22:08:38 I guess your finding out that Big Oil runs the joint?
925 2018-12-31 22:08:21 Exactly how much CBD oil is in each product?  What quality of CBD oil?  Is it synthetic?
926 2018-12-31 22:08:15 @BloombergTV I would like to see some facts and figures presented by the analyst that said he is waiting for $SWN to go broke, in the 'OIL roller coaster' piece. Have you studied SWN to see how much of their income is based upon oil??
927 2018-12-31 22:07:50 Time to stock up on the squirrel oil @CaptAndrewLuck @Colts
928 2018-12-31 22:07:34 Stop being so grumpy. Are you telling us that the liberals spin on things were any different? Besides the public only knows what the big oil companies want the public to know. Prices at the pump don't necessarily reflect prices at the well.
929 2018-12-31 22:07:29 The current stock market is reminding me a little of 2016 Jan times... oil ticking lower also is setting us up for a further bearish run it seems! Exciting volatile times ahead for sure! Happy new year 
930 2018-12-31 22:07:14 Leave coconut oil in 2018. It’s greasy asf and clogging of the pores.
931 2018-12-31 22:07:07 They really don’t have olive oil in the international aisle here. I see where Italy is..... 

America.
932 2018-12-31 22:07:02 Oh and tar sands are in California 
Alberta doesn’t have tar sands
We have oil sands ... aka bitumen 

Feel free to take a geography class

934 2018-12-31 22:06:39 I bought fresh crab cakes. Going to cook them in a pan for 3-5 minutes per side in oil and butter. My gf is now telling me how do I am bc she would do 2 minutes for a sear and 325 in the oven for 5 mins. She is adamant they will be raw my way. I can't deal. I really can't.
935 2018-12-31 22:06:16 #Ecobank just debited me D100 for annual maintenance card maintenance, I was thinking they’ll collect my card and change the Engine oil, filter and brakes then they can call it maintenance. Happy New Year

940 2018-12-31 22:05:41 Shouldn’t we be spending less. Not buying anything oil related. Gas, oil, medical supplies , phones  computers.... oh and beef. Can’t have cow farts assaulting the climate. There’s really nothing left to spend money on.
941 2018-12-31 22:05:32 4 matching oil rubbed bronze fixtures. 1) Bathroom 4 light vanity fixture 2) Kitchen bar/island 3 fixture pendant 3)Dining table chandelier 4) Foyer pendant chandelier
942 2018-12-31 22:05:28 This Connor “trade-out” talk is non-sense. Kopitar, Stamkos, Ovi & Crosby waited a long while before winning. I’m not saying Oil direction is right (too impatient & trend chasing rather than setting). The other factor is Edmonton is a terrible draw (climate, fans & media).

949 2018-12-31 22:04:19 Putin wants climate change legislation to knock down his competitors in oil
950 2018-12-31 22:04:19 Always cheese, olives, oil with balsamic and good bread.
951 2018-12-31 22:04:05 Funny thing is people hear what they wanna hear from Oil press conferences anyway, so listening somewhat optional
952 2018-12-31 22:04:05 You mean the conservative controlled government full of climate deniers and oil lobbyists? Or are you talking about some shadowy "WORLD GOVERNMENT" made up of lizard people and aliens?
953 2018-12-31 22:03:52 That’s a loaded bet largely because energy is such a huge component and at this moment energy is cheap. So while I still prefer Trumps future to the lefts, oil could conveniently win you that bet yet mean essentially nothing.
954 2018-12-31 22:03:45 @SohiAmarjeet Good thing for Canadian oil and gas - keeping  your private jet in the air.  Why isn't Butt on a commercial flight with lower emissions?
Time to take a knee Alberta.  No need to respect Canada any more.  Show your disrepect when that "0 Canada" jingle comes on.
955 2018-12-31 22:03:39 House cleaned, clothes washed, candles lit, oil defuser going.... but no food 
956 2018-12-31 22:03:19 I suggest purifying yourself with holy oil in order to rid yourself of the visions that will eventually lead to night terrors.
957 2018-12-31 22:03:18 There used to be many industries dependent on whale oil. People are creative and can find other opportunities. Please don’t underestimate them.
958 2018-12-31 22:03:16 This is why he should return the contributions over $200 from the 29 oil executives!! He is an amazing candidate. It is only $400k and would regain the strength we need in a platform for 2020 - PLEASE tell him progressives are praying he does!!!
959 2018-12-31 22:03:07 Coconut oil is too heavy on my skin and irritates it. I always cleans with @dermalogica Precleanse and then go back through and use their Daily Microfoliant and it is literally the best.
960 2018-12-31 22:02:54 It has the oil from citrus peel in it I think
961 2018-12-31 22:02:42 blocked riffraff shilling for oil companies...
962 2018-12-31 22:02:35 I'm on it for my post concussion syndrome. It helps with the lingering symptoms I have from it (brain fog, nausea, feeling dazed). Its a strictly gluten free, dairy free, and low sugar diet. I also take turmeric and omega 3 fish oil which are both highly anti-inflammatory as well
963 2018-12-31 22:02:32 Rumor has it that Trump needs a foil
Someone to literally boil in oil
I wont hazard a guess
Or clean up his mess
He can stew til his pants he soils
964 2018-12-31 22:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

970 2018-12-31 22:01:27 Is that why Trump is stripping regulations to increase US energy production and pressing on OPEC?

Do you think 25% lower oil prices are helping or hurting Putin?
971 2018-12-31 22:01:12 Just had to mark a car unsafe to drive please take care of your shit y’all. Driving is a privilege. There’s more to just oil changes and rotations especially after the 100k range.
972 2018-12-31 22:00:54 There is credible evidence debunking @FairQuestions, she has not presented any evidence when asked by @politicalham. Has been debunked and shown she is paid by big oil.

975 2018-12-31 22:00:31 Do you still have palm oil in your products? If yes, enough of the ‘responsibly sourced’ propaganda and put the environment and ethics above your profits.

981 2018-12-31 22:00:05 Jen, I work in the industry, most plastics can be recycled. Also if you burn it safely, it is a heat source. Plastics are an oil derivative, being more efficient than burning coal. A tonne of plastic has a +53% Calorific Value higher than coal. The industry has told the Gov that.

984 2018-12-31 21:59:47 U.S. crude oil closed up slightly Monday but ended the year down 24.9% at $45.41 a barrel. It had closed as high as $77.41 a barrel in late June, falling 41.3% from that peak.
985 2018-12-31 21:59:22 Have you read Soil Not Oil? It's a short precise scientific read. I highly recommend it.
986 2018-12-31 21:59:19 Yeah....as a conservative I actually agree.....Climate change is a hoax......all materials used in Solar and Wind farms is either mined or a the by product of Oil....Coal and or  Nuclear the only alternative.....
987 2018-12-31 21:59:16 Same!! And you can't use just every product. Gotta make sure it's a oil free, which is a pain in the ass, cause I don't think there's enough oil free products out there. 
988 2018-12-31 21:59:12 Impeach? For what, the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, bringing back manufacturing jobs from overseas, giving Americans lower taxes and higher pays, highest employment for Blacks, Women & Hispanics, creating peace in Korea, making us oil independent, highest GDP in years...
989 2018-12-31 21:59:08 Fusion is snake oil.
990 2018-12-31 21:59:05 So gas prices have nothing to do with the price of a barrel of oil? Who knew?
991 2018-12-31 21:59:01 I wonder why they wanted to leave one of the most oil rich nations on earth?
992 2018-12-31 21:58:57 Use Design Essntials products. Will keep your hair moisturized and and tea tree oil

995 2018-12-31 21:58:33 Opposition to Canadian oil? Actually anything but. She has long advocated increased refining and consumption of our own product rather than shipment of our raw resources abroad.

1000 2018-12-31 21:58:24 President Trump is doing things to the environment he should not be doing!  Allowing oil drilling in National Parks, oceans, rivers and generally really not caring about the environment.  Mercury in the water needs to have better control!  President is not qualified/President
1001 2018-12-31 21:58:04 25% lower oil prices....since that helps Putin so much!
1002 2018-12-31 21:57:59 @chefsymon  happy new year! What's the best virgin olive oil brand to buy at the local supermarket? Thanks

1005 2018-12-31 21:57:41 I hate it! I can literally feel the oil collect on my face
1006 2018-12-31 21:57:37 Oil ur account 2019
1007 2018-12-31 21:57:34 US tankers, Quatar tankers, Denmark and Norway. Not at triple cost. Cost very close to Russian price. It's a part of Trump's approach to hit Russia's pockets. That's why he perused Saudies and Qatar to produce more oil a d drive barrel price down
1008 2018-12-31 21:56:59 TO Rosehip Seed Oil. No matter if I use just one or two drops.. it doesn‘t sink in and my skin feels horribly oily very soon after using it.
1009 2018-12-31 21:56:38 At that point the Wendy's twitter account decides who's the next president based on retweets and who makes the best dad puns
1010 2018-12-31 21:56:36 So??  Ha Ha
1011 2018-12-31 21:56:36 yes! idr if you use csp but it's the default oil paint brush under the brush sub tool
1012 2018-12-31 21:56:32 I use coconut oil 
1013 2018-12-31 21:56:29 I was frying empanadas for my mom just now n had hot oil splash up in my face FEELS GOOD
1014 2018-12-31 21:56:26 I hate paying someone to change my oil, but I’m to lazy to do it today
1015 2018-12-31 21:56:22 Yeah just lethargic effort all around today

Well at least as a caps fan you have something to be proud of most of the time (I’m an oil fan lol)
1016 2018-12-31 21:56:16 I know, I mean what will you specialize or focus in showcasing and promoting
1017 2018-12-31 21:56:11 It wasn't incompetence as much as it was greed. They wanted to cut up ownership of the oil in northern Iraq
1018 2018-12-31 21:55:56 This is the longest oil change in life.
1019 2018-12-31 21:55:46 Off the oil I might go all out tonight 
1020 2018-12-31 21:55:44 And at the same time had lots of oil coming in and also sold the council housing stock, water companies, railways, British gas, British oil, British petroleum, British steel, British telecom, national power, powergen, rolls Royce, British airways. What do they do with the money??
1021 2018-12-31 21:55:39 They killed him trump helped cover it up. Every since the dollar has been back up by oil instead of gold, America has been kissing Saudi ass, sending troops to die to protect the oil from other Arab countries.
1022 2018-12-31 21:55:34 To subpoena Convos Trump officials had w/ oil and gas execs?
1023 2018-12-31 21:55:34 Sellouts, each one of them. I won't support any candidate who takes money from Big Pharma, Big Oil, Wall Street, corporations; who supports private prisons, who doesn't support single payer - I don't care WHAT letter's behind their name. Dem? big deal
1024 2018-12-31 21:55:09 Either I’m sweating coconut oil or it’s dripping out of my hair
1025 2018-12-31 21:55:04 -Use a face and lip scrub (honey, brown sugar and coconut oil)                                        -Use olive oil on your face before and after bed.                       -Use cocobutter lotion.                   -Eat less greasy and sugary foods

1029 2018-12-31 21:54:29 Sorry--not a fan!!
1030 2018-12-31 21:54:23 That’s what I wanted to know too. Are they trying to investigate oil companies or something?
1031 2018-12-31 21:54:18 One party is for fighting climate change and the other doesnt give a rat's a$$. Putin with his massive frozen oil fields chose the other for us (though he also had a plant in the Dem party as a spoiler who didn't win nomination)
1032 2018-12-31 21:54:02 Yes, really.  If you didn’t have your head so far down in dirty oil and RU, you’d know.
1033 2018-12-31 21:53:49 And that's a pretty rad oil spill too
1034 2018-12-31 21:53:48 Attaway, don’t burn your fingers in that oil. Or, just get boozy enough not to notice if you do.
1035 2018-12-31 21:53:45 I am truly upset with @Walmart @WalmartInc...I been shopping with them for years and getting my car oil change for a while but plz get me to understand, why did I called 4 walmart in houston and went to one and none of them have high mileage oil.?
1036 2018-12-31 21:53:41 Basil essential oil and lemongrass essential oil have worked in my experience. Good luck!
1037 2018-12-31 21:53:28 usually you can fix it yourself if you have the manual. but other times good craft/sewing stores have replacement parts. but also, you CAN older a new one if it's somehow gotten warped. its sometimes that the machine needs oil or is clogged with something, too. which can be fixed
1038 2018-12-31 21:53:23 only if you were paid a penny for every BS you throw out... oh wait you’re being paid oil dollars for B’sing
1039 2018-12-31 21:53:08 I told you oil, ya scalp prob just dry
1040 2018-12-31 21:52:38 Oil rub on the feet. Does wonders. Helps pull toxins out of the body too.
1041 2018-12-31 21:52:31 Dallas was ugly too, but that’s no surprise with oil
1042 2018-12-31 21:52:05 I'm sorry Alexandria, you're now learning that both sides are either bought by big oil or so worried about their seat they don't make a peep..
They worry about votes, they worry about their investments, worries about the environment come last in line.

1047 2018-12-31 21:50:53 Oh honey, that is unacceptable! In the future, remember that lemon oil will remove all things sticky, even gum! 
I’m sorry to hear this. #meanpeoplesuck
1048 2018-12-31 21:50:48 Did he say exactly how Mexico would pay for the wall? Not that I remember.

Flynn was setup. Pruitt was fine other than he lacked balls. Manafort was fired by Trump. Zinke has US as leading oil exporter, helped drop price /gal. Reibus was an off hire. Sessions did something...
1049 2018-12-31 21:50:40 Most of our oil come from Alberta and US, through no.9.
1050 2018-12-31 21:50:38 I was up 75% earlier this year on the stockmarket, but last few months of 2018 has made some heavy losses on some oil stocks. However MAHA saved me and ending up around 27,6% YTD. Wish you all a happy new year and hope for a better 2019 as this year been pretty rough! Happy 2019!
1051 2018-12-31 21:50:19 Yes, yes it does. Lol
1052 2018-12-31 21:50:18 I'm the oil crisis years old.
1053 2018-12-31 21:50:16 They're killing us slowly with their plans. First they destroy the air quality, water quality, seismic blast and frack for oil disrupting the earth itself, and ignore global warming. Only those corrupted would think to do this.
1054 2018-12-31 21:50:00 Burst into the kitchen because @zoobisou was making panic sounds at the stove as we get ready to fry chicken. She burned hot chocolate...by adding ice cold vodka to it...on the burner. Needless to say I will be handling the near-boiling oil tonight. #HappyNewYear #boozydessert
1055 2018-12-31 21:49:58 I know what you mean . What did you do these art works with?? Paint, watercolor, oil, pencil, computer?? I'm curious, because these are amazing! 
1056 2018-12-31 21:49:57 Beto is in a state with a prominent oil industry, many people work for the oil industry. Is that the same as somone in Wisconsin taking money from the oil industry? I think that there needs to be balance, yet Beto has to represent the oil industry somewhat, right?
1057 2018-12-31 21:49:44 5% relief agaist 40% reduction in oil prices. Shame on those celebrating. Not even what was recommended by OGRA.
1058 2018-12-31 21:49:42 He still has to win the Supreme Court popular vote tho.

The well was landed horizontally in the Cretaceous aged El Abra formation limestone.

1061 2018-12-31 21:49:26 Will you send me the link to hot and fast?  I was thinking heat a cast iron with oil and brush on the other side and torch that side. It's a dry aged and pretty thin.
1062 2018-12-31 21:49:19 How is it better for the one world if Canada reduces or eliminates oil but purchases it from Saudi Arabia who have no environmental controls?  We are part of that one world!
1063 2018-12-31 21:49:12 Took my car to get an oil change they said I need an front end alignment  dc are y’all paying for my car I mean cuz I lost count how many potholes I hit a week

1066 2018-12-31 21:48:59 Make your tweets more appealing to the pan-fried eating middle classes by hand curating them with beard oil under the glowing filaments of an Edison light bulb. Served with a side of missed sarcasm.
1067 2018-12-31 21:48:45 Plus 5/6 cardamom pods 1tsp salt, 1/2 tsp tumeric to pan and sauté for a few minutes or until fragrant. Add a 2/3 diced tomatoes  and cook down until thick and the oil has risen to the top of the masala. Add about 500g of shredded/diced turkey and warm through.

1080 2018-12-31 21:46:59 You're both short term. The Russian zone of the Artic ocean has the largest share gas/oil – its potential reserves amount to approximately 48 billion barrels of oil and 43 trillion cubic meters of natural gas. Obviously it will surpass a stagnant Italy.

1082 2018-12-31 21:46:45 It’s more complicated than that. Media pretends the answers are black and white. Yemen is the world’s most complex conflict and 33-year old MBS has done remarkably well to keep it from destabilizing his country and disrupting global oil supplies, all things considered.

1101 2018-12-31 21:44:24 Even if emissions are as big a problem as you suggest, government intervention is far from the answer. It’s arguable that gov is more of the bad guy than oil companies on a committee. It’s not as if government doesn’t have anything to gain from taxing the hell out of everyone.

1130 2018-12-31 21:40:16 The issue is not with small donations from individuals who are employed in the gas/oil industry - it is a problem with the fact that #Beto accepted 29 “large” campaign contributions by people with significant ties to the financial future of fossil fuel.

1142 2018-12-31 21:39:26 Why do we not have a refiner. We were one of the top oil producers for years. Doing what the USA wants like usual. The cost to us us ridiculous.
1143 2018-12-31 21:39:22 I don’t even understand moderate Dems ? In the middle on climate change ? healthcare can wait?  .... kids in cages are half ok ? ... some corporate $ by oil and Insurance Is cool ? civil rights and democracy are ok if they are half assed? Happy to say  I’m a radicalized lefty

1145 2018-12-31 21:39:13 Zoloft totally works for me, but did not work at all for my sister. MK — You are working at it - that is very positive!! CBD oil, magnesium, laughing until it hurts all help me boost its effectiveness. Je suis triste, aussi, mais j’espere.

1148 2018-12-31 21:38:53 I listened to less than 5 minutes of anything he ever said. 

Avenatti is the snake of snake oil lawyers.
1149 2018-12-31 21:38:46 Thyme, etc is a good idea, will have to try that. I've been using avocado oil instead of butter/olive oil so I can turn the heat up to 400+ without smoking.
1150 2018-12-31 21:38:39 Seperation is the answer,you can buy your oil from your favourite regimes like Saudia Arabia and Nigeria,we can sell our resources to the highest bidder,everyone is happy
1151 2018-12-31 21:38:30 Biden is incompetent and just another spineless politician, Beto is a centrist who takes money from oil companies, Warren is a hypocrite who says she hates money in politics but still accepts funding from corporate executives. Bernie remains the best and only hope of beating him
1152 2018-12-31 21:38:23 Make your new years resolution to cut down on meat, or turn veggie, or vegan, or cut out animal tested products, or cut out palm oil, recycle more or just turn off that standby button.
Think of the positive impact you can make. #NewYearsEve

1154 2018-12-31 21:38:09 Sure, coming up! Infuse 1 tsp saffron in 100mls warm milk and set aside. Fry 500g (2-3) sliced onions in ghee or oil until dark brown and caramelised but not burnt (at least 20-30 mins) set aside half for garnish.
1155 2018-12-31 21:38:05 In 2019 I will add another skincare product other than jojoba oil lol

1165 2018-12-31 21:36:33 I’ve offered divestment against the warmongers and the fossil fools as a solution for years. 

I’ve been part of several divestment movements.

Trillions have been divested & this peaceful method is successful. It takes time.

want peace. support divestment from israel, oil & war

They are in the game for the long run, but it maybe to late. Please stop picking fights with everyone who disagrees with you NOW. You must covince all

1172 2018-12-31 21:34:52 The same thing happened to me! They tried to charge me $90 ... for an oil change.
1173 2018-12-31 21:34:46 But you are ok with corporate welfare? Our country gives hundreds of billions of dollars every year in subsidies aka corporate welfare to already billion dollar businesses like the oil industry & WHY? Those billions would pay for Healthcare & education with money left over.

1182 2018-12-31 21:33:58 You might want to revisit the participation (not $) of oil/gas companies.  These industries need to transition to clean energy and employ many people.  Like the coal industry - need to find ways to transition both market and employee training.

1212 2018-12-31 21:29:46 Oh you mean the Beto who took hundreds of thousands of dollars from oil company execs and tried to run on not accepting any PAC money? Have you actually looked at his voting record? Probably not. Like most of you new to politics since 2015. You just listen to what they say?
1213 2018-12-31 21:29:40 Protesting social injustice is no leads legitimate than protesting taxes. Both can have merit. Middle class is helped when govt spends on infrastructure, protects worker rights, and tax cuts help all, not just the wealthy.

1217 2018-12-31 21:28:57 I have suffered with depression since I was 4, I am nearly 58.  I have tried everything, pills, potions and therapy.  Nothing works like light yoga and pure cbd oil.  It takes about 2 weeks taken twice a day to work.  I have been 2 years depression free....
1218 2018-12-31 21:28:53 Not disputing the popularity, I'm sure it is.  But there's no meaningful way to vote against the interests of the oil industry in AB: all electable parties are linearly dependent in that regard.  The only real degree of freedom is in the healthcare dimension.
1219 2018-12-31 21:28:39 I guarantee in Canada we will not be turning the taps off in 1 or 2 decades, we'll freeze to death, we need to drive cars and everything else we need oil for, we are no where near replacing fossil fuels
1220 2018-12-31 21:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1221 2018-12-31 21:28:35 Have they run out snakes to squeeze the oil out of?
1222 2018-12-31 21:28:30 Canada is still a net exporter so a low dollar does have some positive impact on industries that export. Oil & Gas companies need this variance these days for sure.
1223 2018-12-31 21:28:08 yeah saturated fats like palm oil you can heat as high as you want with no issues

1228 2018-12-31 21:27:36 It’s really quite sad that oil & gas companies have such a hold on the politics of climate change. @NancyPelosi should really move the Dems to EFFECTIVELY address
1229 2018-12-31 21:27:30 I am now going to get off Twitter for a while and do what any good Italian does in times of disappointment. I'm going to go find some good olive oil, fry some garlic and onions, add tomatoes and drown my sorrows in Italian food :)
1230 2018-12-31 21:27:24 Time to start naming names.

Anyone that takes money from Oil & Gas, or that takes money from the Wall St criminals needs to be outed, primaried and sent packing.

Anyone that treats the Wall St banksters as fellow humans (like Biden/Beto/Hillary) is a disgusting sellout.
1231 2018-12-31 21:27:20 Keep fighting. Read Jerry Robinson's Bankruptcy of Our Nation to find the REAL reason your demands were rejected. Our economy is held ransom by oil.

1233 2018-12-31 21:26:57 It was in the late 70’s and 80’s due to the high oil revenues but these days are gone and they’re not coming back

If your motive is animal welfare and not wanting to kill farm animals then consider this;  make no mistake many animals die to produce this food too. Cocktails of pesticides, palm oil ravaging rain forests, nitrogen poisioning soil.

1242 2018-12-31 21:25:21 You ever been? Still an experience. Plus probably a lot of oil money as potential new donors. Better 1,000 people there than 1,000 at the Pit.

1253 2018-12-31 21:24:01 I also check his room often. Nothing intrusive. Just scent and sight scan. Then I change sheets, launder dirty clothes then spray down the room with a spray I made of water with drops peppermint oil. I mixed drops peppermint oil into cornstarch to sprinkle on his rug and vacuum

1256 2018-12-31 21:23:10 Why would you be waiting, and according to your Bloomberg interview, wanting $SWN to go broke? I've always known them as a natural gas company, with a small hand in oil. I'll not trust Bloomberg again.

1260 2018-12-31 21:22:39 By corporate donors to the Dem Party who told Steny Hoyer and company to make sure any new committee cant have subpoena power to call up the criminals in big oil that have known about and continue to profit from the externalities of the sludge they sell that causes climate change
1261 2018-12-31 21:22:39 Grape seed oil also works
1262 2018-12-31 21:22:37 They'll need Niagara's migrant farm workers if the price of a barrel drops, to sell off shore. Harper should have built a refinery with all his years of oil spending.
1263 2018-12-31 21:22:32 Taxation hollows out the middle class if wages do not equal or exceed inflation reducing purchasing power over time.
Most protesting in U.S over social issues really have no understanding of fundamentals, they just know how they " feel."
1264 2018-12-31 21:22:28 Quite possible. I think oil is probably the most important variable to watch next year.

1269 2018-12-31 21:21:55 If we turn off oil production tomorrow, what happens to our economy? Can we weather that?
1270 2018-12-31 21:21:49 So by trying to protect his citizens with a wall, creating more jobs,bringing oil back home,pulling our troops out of money draining senceless wars,and pulling out of Paris Climate agreement is anti american?  Weird how people think protecting US citizens first is anti american
1271 2018-12-31 21:21:46 I got mine dope beauty products. Exfoliating gloves. Scented products that appeal to teen boys. I compliment him so much he loves showers lol. I even got him lotion and natural oil blends that he likes. He’s been having crushes and trying to impress in middle school lol

1276 2018-12-31 21:21:12 Praying! I've heard those head colds r quite debilitating !
May I suggest Oil of Oregano?!
It kills VIRUSES & bacterial infections & fungi!
Jon, it WORKS!
Oh,chicken bone broth.
Oil of Oregano --God's Creation--has absolutely NO side effects!
It was even shown to kill Swine 
1277 2018-12-31 21:21:07 Yes, really, you tool of the oil industry.
1278 2018-12-31 21:20:58 yeah right Tom - part of that "Russian conspiracy" was a plan to totally revitalize the oil and gas industry in America & boom the US economy & destroy Russian finances & Impose sanctions on oligarchs money – yeah, good theory LOL @sullivanradio

1285 2018-12-31 21:20:29 I hope so. As much as I'm trying to joke about, I'm also like "I should have made inari too!"

Riceballs are easy, if you have a rice cooker & sesame seed oil.

Otherwise: sweet or savory?
1286 2018-12-31 21:20:16 In a world where oil pipes are polluting water in Flint, Jeff Bezos employs people in factory positions with abhorrent work conditions, and Zuckerberg states he’s more interested in doing what’s good for facebook than what’s good for the people who are using his service, why the

Thanks Trump!

Not good for Putin....
1289 2018-12-31 21:19:56 Lemme help. If it's not as bad as i think, go to a river, the dirtiest part, walk into the water up to ur knee level. Pick the sands that are at ur knee level.. Go there with a bottle of red oil & black soap.. Squat & soak ur undies.. Errm I jst forgot d end as i saw in movie
1290 2018-12-31 21:19:56 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
1291 2018-12-31 21:19:49 Priesthood teacher told us his relative was in an oil rig explosion in WY. When the body was brought to the hospital everything under the garments was perfect, tho head/limbs were gone. So, yeah...
1292 2018-12-31 21:19:49 Natural hair companies making bank off the fact not many people know 80% of their product is water and oil lol. The same stuff you can get at the store with the same or better results. Water and oil by itself is what I used on my hair and locs and it worked wonders
1293 2018-12-31 21:19:49 What a fake, con man, snake oil salesman.... You made you bed sleep in it, if the sho fits ware it, or just call a neurologist.
1294 2018-12-31 21:19:37 Happy new year from Brazil!!
1295 2018-12-31 21:19:31 I actually like spicy and sweet too! ... just not SALTY and sweet (so I’ve taken to clarifying I’m anti sweet + salty as opposed to sweet + savory.) ... in LS I went through a haribo gummy bears + (non salty) hot chili oil phase 
1296 2018-12-31 21:19:29 He just mentioned that on his show too! Amazing!

1298 2018-12-31 21:19:18 400 ppm is less than a drop of water in the a lake. Plants filter out CO2 or else we would be at 500 PPM soon, please don't try to sell your snake oil on knowledgeable people because it make you look like a rube
1299 2018-12-31 21:19:07 Surely you can understand that people were suspicious when oilmen (and others) wanted to invade a country with lots of oil. The Neocons were probably the main cheerleaders; but you can’t blame people for being suspicious in the early days of the war.
1300 2018-12-31 21:18:56 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
1301 2018-12-31 21:18:34 People just assume Conservatives are best stewards of the economy. They are not. Harper drove up the national debt during a time of peak oil prices. Harris drove Ontario's debt from $90.7 billion in 1994-1995 to $132.6 billion in 2002-2003 even while cutting services.
1302 2018-12-31 21:18:32 So for cooking gurus when palm oil is black is it bad?
1303 2018-12-31 21:18:19 I wish everyone had an endless supply of free energy to repair the earth, create clean water & stop wars. Wars are all about oil & energy.
1304 2018-12-31 21:18:18 Oil was for it before it was against it!
1305 2018-12-31 21:18:16 I’ve been so calm and confident these past couple days and honestly I think it’s because of the eucalyptus essential oil I got for christmas
1306 2018-12-31 21:18:06 My favourite part of today was @JasonGregor on Lowetide's show and talking about how Caggiula tearing tendons in his thumb during practice, in a drill where players dove after pucks with no sticks. Only in Edmonton. #Oilers

1308 2018-12-31 21:17:55 The smell of the chicken oil will dull your anticipation
1309 2018-12-31 21:17:39 Seems unlikely without the Dollar dropping. Oil falling is a direct consequence of the Fed's overly tight strategy. Oil is NOT falling in dollars, it is appreciating in RMB. With Chinese oil contract becoming more active, there is arbitrage taking place, forcing US$ oil lower.
1310 2018-12-31 21:17:36 Most, in fact virtually all petrogeologists and oil company professionals think it’s made from organic matter. While abiogenetic oil is certainly possible, no-one has ever found and exploited any.

1314 2018-12-31 21:17:14 Robert Francis O'Rourke lost. He won't get progressives, or millennials to vote for him in large numbers, nor would he beat Trump. He's an uglier version of Little Nicky, and has a history of only putting forward pro business measures. That's not to even mention oil money.
1315 2018-12-31 21:17:13 Rosehip oil has saved my face this winter. @PaulasChoice BHA solution is my secret weapon to keep acne away & I use their spf 50 facial fluid.

1322 2018-12-31 21:16:27 You’re right, but the oil companies were too powerful then. Even after the 1973 Oil Embargo. And the world, and all future generations, are paying for it now.

1324 2018-12-31 21:16:05 —U.S. crude oil output hit an all-time high of more than 11.5 million barrels per day in October, according to government data released on Monday. Via @CollinEatonHC #shale #OOTT
1325 2018-12-31 21:15:34 Let’s see, great economy, cheap energy prices, much better trade deals, Isis defeated etc etc. and people want this president out ?  And what instead? 8 years of malaise with another snake oil slick talking hustler that promises the moon and runs up 10 trillion in debt ?  WHY ??
1326 2018-12-31 21:15:28 zerohedge "“Most recessions are preceded by oil trading higher. That did not happen” 

Oh so oil wasn’t at 86 three months ago before it plunged to 53?"
1327 2018-12-31 21:15:28 sana oil, hny ta!!
1328 2018-12-31 21:15:26 That's because they ramped up coal mining and oil and gas production. The tax won't work in the first year, but it will incentivize alternative sources of energy over time.
1329 2018-12-31 21:15:09 Just drove by the local Family Video and their sign indicates they’re now selling CBD oil. I think I was more surprised that there’s still a Family Video.
1330 2018-12-31 21:15:05 Because after awhile snake oil salesman don’t even realize they are snake oil salesmen.
1331 2018-12-31 21:14:59 The Democratic Coalition’s ongoing investigation just uncovered the following evidence linking Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to Russian oil money and a campaign finance scandal. Len Blavatnik is a Russian1 oligarch with US and UK citizenship who donated to Sen.Graham’s 2016

1336 2018-12-31 21:14:30 tea tree oil smells weird
1337 2018-12-31 21:14:23  Oil up the other reindeer..
1338 2018-12-31 21:14:21 Likely tied in with decline in oil prices? Wonder what the correlation is over time.
1339 2018-12-31 21:14:18 Probably more misleading. Low oil prices being the big factor whereas the carbon tax being a small one.
1340 2018-12-31 21:14:11 Oil was my number one short in 2018.  My puts each month lost money for 10 months.  In the 11th and 12th month they went from $0.02 to $10. So Im using those profits to own puts each month on $tsla. I'm doing quite well.  I've risked as little as possible and have made big gains
1341 2018-12-31 21:14:01 That’s not good for business... right now you guys need to clean the mess up... especially when the oil economy is dying.. u need tourism ! A place that’s depending on an oil economy,has no real future.. present moment
1342 2018-12-31 21:13:59 I watch the futures market, especially oil. We reached peak oil last year. Becoming less profitable. The Saudis and The Rockefeller family Trust have been quietly divesting oil. For years.
1343 2018-12-31 21:13:56 Fight back against what? The general consensus about pipelines being important? Unless the UCP is seriously planning to terrorize citizens and oil company execs with whatever might they can quasi-legally apply, their plan is like most other conservative plans - all talk. #ableg
1344 2018-12-31 21:13:51 Nope,not patient,good you acknowledged the benefits Ontario has received over the years manufacturing goods for the oil industry

1348 2018-12-31 21:13:29 Yes we need the wall.  We also need higher oil prices so our great state of Texas can keep jobs and drill more.
1349 2018-12-31 21:13:26 That is such a bullshit distortion. He took no corporate money. He did receive money from people who work in oil and gas which is to be expected in fucking Texas.
1350 2018-12-31 21:13:23 It just tells you who their canola oil supplier is ;)
1351 2018-12-31 21:13:01 Without oil we wouldn't have plastic stir sticks we all use to stir our hot beverages. Do you want that? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming

1361 2018-12-31 21:11:26 It’s the USA Today. 

Its literally only used by grandpas in their garages to cover the floor when they do an oil change.

1366 2018-12-31 21:11:13 My favourite albums of 2018:

13. Low - Double Negative 
12. The Samps - Breakfast

1367 2018-12-31 21:11:11 In the early days of the Iraq War, it did look like it might be a war for oil. The oil men in Bush’s cabinet had been pushing for the war. The fact that they didn’t get the oil may be more due to overconfidence and incompetence, rather than a surfeit of honesty.
1368 2018-12-31 21:11:08 Ive never used any! I just started using a $38 day oil i got as a gift and it physically hurts that i love it so much
1369 2018-12-31 21:11:06 Go drunk you're home
1370 2018-12-31 21:10:50 Maybe that US andCanada have massive oil and gas reserves now easy with fracking? I do not know.

1373 2018-12-31 21:10:34 Oh yeah, eucalyptus oil and essence of motor oil. Also start Pilates and some hot yoga. Only eat meat on Thursdays and never, EVER refer to your dog in the 3rd person.
1374 2018-12-31 21:10:25 70 cents more per litre in a couple years tacked on with the carbon tax. Add that to another maybe major Oil price rise and we have an unprofitable transport industry unless the cost of goods goes way up to accommodate.
1375 2018-12-31 21:10:19 髪がさーサラサラしてるのちょっと気にしてんだよなー
1376 2018-12-31 21:10:17 Keith what’s you 2019 view on oil? Bullish or bearish? Thanks
1377 2018-12-31 21:10:15 Sounds like a communist to me: they specialize in destroying development and creating an extreme poverty population. A perfect recent example and quite close to the USA: Venezuela, an oil, gold, iron, coltan rich country taken to extreme poverty. Do the Americans want that?
1378 2018-12-31 21:10:09 RT @LivingSafely: Ritz Original Crackers this January? Its top four ingredients are flour, soybean oil, sugar and cottonseed oil.

1385 2018-12-31 21:09:14 McDermott and Beane can talk about these intangible things that we can’t see, feelings and what their vision is etc., all they want, but their fate is going to come down the win and loss categories. 

Their talk is cheap. Put up or shut up 2019. No more snake oil for sale.
1386 2018-12-31 21:09:13 Maybe oil and coal will get scrapped in a few hundred years. Meanwhile, yes to all of the above. Cleaner FF's use is totally doable, and what is needed is reliable energy NOW for the developing world.

1388 2018-12-31 21:09:02 I've already asked someone, but many outlooks, leads to a better grasp.
(1) If Alberta separates, you'll still be landlocked, how will that help in getting oil to tidewater ?
1389 2018-12-31 21:08:44 Amin, Sir they is a Hadith,I can't remember,but it talks abt a sahabah which other companions inform Nabi  (saw) abt his bravery in jihad...
1390 2018-12-31 21:08:36 Yep. It's a fascinating cultural blindness. The hangover from that 20 year cognitive denial binge is going to be rough, & undo a lot of other ethical & practical goals. Apart from visible villains (oil co's), I think economists & environmental NGO's really kneecapped our society.
1391 2018-12-31 21:08:24 Since 6 days I replace my Protein source by Oil and gravy thickener.
1392 2018-12-31 21:08:04 The point is other than oil used for energy . Oil today is used to make ovef 6000 normal house hold products . If you stop using it for energy then those product prices increase to an unaffordable amount . Are you prepared for that ?
1393 2018-12-31 21:08:00 Also pan fried in walnut oil with pine nuts and mangetout.
1394 2018-12-31 21:07:53 But why the Kartel hook start play ina head after reading this?

*gets consecrated oil*
1395 2018-12-31 21:07:50 We can buy from Korea a lot cheaper, after separation our dollar would be par with American,the rest of Canada would have a 50 cent dollar and you would be buying all your oil from foreigners with your 50 cent dollar,math is hard for Easterners apparently.
1396 2018-12-31 21:07:50 I agree Alberta has most of its manufacturing for the oil sands done in the East
1397 2018-12-31 21:07:50 Flaming oil
1398 2018-12-31 21:07:33 Oil prices 25% lower...which is terrible for Putin.
1399 2018-12-31 21:07:20 My bros gf forgot this oil based perfume in my room. When I tell you that thing is exquisite. After two showers, I can still smell it on me . Thanks sis

1401 2018-12-31 21:07:05 I drove my car with its oil light on for a day, but since it's a Toyota Camry nothing bad came of it.
1402 2018-12-31 21:06:40 Well I use the men’s one now but I also like the aloe or the baby oil one.
1403 2018-12-31 21:06:27 So,.. a Texas based oil company wasn’t profitable ?
1404 2018-12-31 21:06:26 In 2003, "Operation Iraqi Freedom" began as "Operation Iraqi Liberation". 

The original name became OIL as an acronym. US Joint Cheifs feared this was "too accurate" and the CIA would jeopardize sources & methods. Thus, a quick name change.
1405 2018-12-31 21:06:19 One time I paid 100 dollars for an oil change 
1406 2018-12-31 21:06:17 Omg this little 5 year old here at the oil change place is telling the mechanic how much he loves paul McCartney 
1407 2018-12-31 21:05:57 i ordered this strawberry scented "lip oil" bc obviously 3 clear lipglosses doesnt cut it and i love wasting money :/ but this has that incredibly fake starwberry smell mmmm it is oddly nostalgic
1408 2018-12-31 21:05:55 This is a lie. These prices have nothing to do with your cap and trade and everything to do with the crashing price of oil. BTW, here in Calgary it's 89.9, and we have a carbon tax. Be better.#onpoli
1409 2018-12-31 21:05:51 Put oil, and seasoning before you put it in the sous vide bath. do you have a joule by any chance?

1414 2018-12-31 21:05:32 I look a hot mess with shilling oil rubbed up on my nose
1415 2018-12-31 21:05:29 I love my shrinkage cause my curls. The second I brush out my curls and/or straighten my hair, I’m always amazed everytime to see how much new growth and how longer my hair got. Feelin like that bitchhh, while hair flippin my shit. Straight tlc, vitamins & virgin coconut oil 
1416 2018-12-31 21:05:18 My oil bottle contains doo gro oil, wild hair growth, peppermint oil, tea tree oil, and black castor oil
1417 2018-12-31 21:05:02 What does vision secrete when he comes?oil?

1419 2018-12-31 21:04:53 so i’m pretty sure i got olive oil in my eye but i have no idea how to get it out
1420 2018-12-31 21:04:39 i burned my chin and oil dropped down my neck
1421 2018-12-31 21:04:38 Let's hope all those folks marching didn't drive there or drink goofy latte coffee with those stirring sticks. All made using oil. You want change, start walking.
1422 2018-12-31 21:04:18 Oil wash change
1423 2018-12-31 21:03:52 I have tried to go long on oil several times. Just failing.

1427 2018-12-31 21:03:27 Looking at someone’s campaign donors and public voting record is misleading how?? Also, the oil industry is literally causing catastrophe
1428 2018-12-31 21:03:07 He didn't do anything wrong... How about we give him a chance!   Welcome to Oil Country Alex #LetsGoOilers
1429 2018-12-31 21:03:07 I need good genes and ufo oil but unfortunately they cost a million dollars
1430 2018-12-31 21:03:03 As a kid I was warned by movies about getting stuck in tar pits.  I have looked out for these ever since but so far I
have only seen a few oil stains  on driveways. #overhyped
1431 2018-12-31 21:02:54 May Allah have Mercy on her soul & other departed Muslims ummah, Ameeeeeeen,is so Sad Wallahi 
1432 2018-12-31 21:02:45 i realized today that i havent gotten an oil change for my car since June. prime example of how bad adulting is going for me.
1433 2018-12-31 21:02:40 Crude oil futures for Feb/March reverse Monday late afternoon $WTI_Crude +1.24% at $45.89 & $NBZ_F +1.11% at $53.80. $USO +1.36% at $9.66 on 12/31/2018.
1434 2018-12-31 21:02:35 It won't hurt anything long term. You may see a drop in performance/fuel economy while you're running non-synthetic but it should be negligible. Do your next oil change a little bit early to take it back to synthetic.
1435 2018-12-31 21:02:27 Go to a homeopathic therapist and try CBD oil ... good luck. I know ... it sucks
1436 2018-12-31 21:02:19 Happy new year to you Vlad. May the best only happen to you and your country. I still hope that oil stays at $50 a barrel however.
1437 2018-12-31 21:02:15 So a few days before the match, and you can still buy tickets in the City end if you’ve been to one previous game! 

They might be backed by oil money now, but they’ll always be Kappa trackie Shaun Goater idolising scruffs with shit muzzies. 

Bigger joke than Chelsea this lot.
1438 2018-12-31 21:02:12 I’m offfffended Cali  cover them with olive oil, minced garlic, lemon juice and roast on cookie sheet for 15-20 minutes. They’re my absolute favorite

1442 2018-12-31 21:02:02 He also opened the arctic open to drilling....twice. He’s been bragging about his ties to oil and fossil fuels in his recent speeches.
1443 2018-12-31 21:01:51 my car leaking oil on the last day of the year seems like a fitting end to my 2018 I guess.
1444 2018-12-31 21:01:49 Gotta get them oil reserves!!
1445 2018-12-31 21:01:47 But alas...the Atlantic is full of plastic...oil slips and general pollution from humans.
1446 2018-12-31 21:01:26 Everyone is a prophet and a Motivational speaker tonight! 

My own oil has refused to flow today so,
See you in 2019 
1447 2018-12-31 21:01:14 Might fuck around and go temporarily blind by getting peppermint oil directly on my eyeball
1448 2018-12-31 21:01:12 It’s infused with truffle oil and I feel cheated over here.

1452 2018-12-31 21:00:48 They did and it caused me to throw up a little! I'm gonna need a sec...
1453 2018-12-31 21:00:45 Beto took more money from oil companies than Cruz after promising not to, but what do we know? We just haven't read enough of the #BetoMania articles the MSM has been feeding us all the sudden

1459 2018-12-31 21:00:20 It's amazing what you can do with almost unlimited funds from oil profits.
1460 2018-12-31 21:00:13 looks like its got oil on it mate?
1461 2018-12-31 21:00:09 The price has dropped .30 cents a barrel.hardly a huge story. The mongrels will just manipulate the market again and increase prices. 
Never a price decrease to match the drop in oil prices yet the increase results in the prices greater in %, Oil Countries are just price fixing?
1462 2018-12-31 21:00:05 Promise?!?  NK still has nuclear sites. Market falling. Mexico is not paying for the wall. He is not supporting the LGBT community. This man is doing nothing but selling snake oil to all his cult followers, like u.
1463 2018-12-31 20:59:59 One of my favorites. Learned to love it in Alaska. I make it similarly except I use shredded roast chicken breast in place of bacon and (sorry) olive oil, top the chilaquiles with a streamer of thickened cream before placing the egg and pico de gallo on top. Great supper idea.
1464 2018-12-31 20:59:48 We don’t use candles in my house  oil defuser all the way 
1465 2018-12-31 20:59:17 I read a comment on the Guardian from a guy who was a manager for an oil company in the Middle East. He said the Muslim staff were permanently on the fiddle, small & large. Apparently this is culture wide and most businesses employ family as they're the only ones they can trust.

1467 2018-12-31 20:59:12 But why would an oil rich earth quake prone country like Iran want to use nuclear energy?
1468 2018-12-31 20:59:11 The medium is what kind of art, oil, pastels, acrylics, anything you can use to make art. ^_^
1469 2018-12-31 20:59:05 Tomorrow is a new year!!  In honor of the new year I will start infusing herbs in oil for future products!!
1470 2018-12-31 20:58:54 Self-serving politicians are gross, but replacing them with criminally corrupt snake oil salesmen, like #DonTheCon @realDonaldTrump , was an error of epic proportions. Maybe America has been dining on dog turds, but now we are chowing down on a dog turd rolled in crushed glass.
1471 2018-12-31 20:58:52 I just remembered I need to get an oil change once I go back .
1472 2018-12-31 20:58:43 I have my 5th of Jim Beam Red Stag in the freezer and my case of Rolling Rock 16oz cans in the frig. I have my vape pen with Gorilla Glue oil 95% THC locked and loaded. Now all I need from you is a date and time so I can join in on the festivities. :D
1473 2018-12-31 20:58:40 It’s always one cup of omega oil between you getting flirted with or full on sexually assaulted

1475 2018-12-31 20:58:13 I lobe the smashbox primer oil. I really want to try the others!!!
1476 2018-12-31 20:58:10 I am from Ottawa, my family is originally from CapeBreton, we are the eastern bastards who were to freeze in the dark, last time you had a hissy fit.  We just paid for GD pipeline and $1.6 billion for the oil industry and possibly buying rail cars, that’s our money, the taxpayer
1477 2018-12-31 20:57:40 The guy is just a moron. Yace that oil money we must eat it, 50 dollars per person 
1478 2018-12-31 20:57:26 At least ask her to check your oil...

1483 2018-12-31 20:57:09 Actually, India is closing coal-fired plants and replacing them with renewables. No need for LNG. Methane leakage is a big problem.

You can't be serious when you say oil sands don't destroy ecosystems. Are you joking?
1484 2018-12-31 20:57:05 Just had to do at least a few hours on this B&W Oil on deep edge canvas today of Queen, showing a young Freddie Mercury & Brian May working their magic together So other than that, hope you all have a Fabulous NYE & a even more Fabulous 2019 
1485 2018-12-31 20:56:46 Yeah, and in 1973 there was only enough oil left for three to five years. And by the 90s we were going to be in an ice age. And climate change science is ”settled” because Chuck Todd says so. Globalism on the March. Say goodbye to liberty,
1486 2018-12-31 20:56:30 I really need an oil change
1487 2018-12-31 20:56:25 I hope you hold the raisins. Mom always tried to fancy them up with raisins or apple. Just dough, deep fried and dripping with oil covered in sugar please!
1488 2018-12-31 20:56:23 ....got the anointing oil brother..... You don't need to go far
1489 2018-12-31 20:56:15 Honestly idk why people just give her so much hate. If it's not people saying she musty, and the engine oil thing it's that like she's precious they need to leave her be

1493 2018-12-31 20:55:55 My hair loves concentrated Olive Oil. 
1494 2018-12-31 20:55:34 Never ever watch a Wrinkle in Time unless you want to be suffocated by an oil slick of saccharine over-emoting
1495 2018-12-31 20:55:30 Dilute it with another oil like almond or olive oil! Lavender is too strong and needs  another oil to pair up with to show better results

1497 2018-12-31 20:55:24 Dressed a salad at my parents' house with an olive oil and soy sauce "vinaigrette". Related, I learned that my parents bizarrely keep side by side dispensers of olive oil and soy sauce on the counter.
1498 2018-12-31 20:55:22 I love olive oil, fresh pressed garlic, parmesan cheese, and salt and pepper. Let it hang out for a while in a bowl, then roast at 425 for 20-30 minutes.  It's amazing.
1499 2018-12-31 20:55:21 sittin here gettin this oil change I jus realized i need to clean my car out today too 
1500 2018-12-31 20:55:15 All is debatable... however the holy trinity (sorry Rev) is onion carrot and celery so I’d say that David perhaps needs to broaden his sofrito horizons. I’d add lots of garlic gently cooked in olive oil.. and I mean lots
1501 2018-12-31 20:54:59 Mhhh cooking oil in 20l drums and bucket. @TumiMmakgabo
1502 2018-12-31 20:54:57 Yuh. No. Oil glut.
1503 2018-12-31 20:54:50 To the tune of $11,000 per oil worker I might add.$1.6 Billion /140,000 workers.
1504 2018-12-31 20:54:46 Trump doesn’t care if Iran nukes Israel and Saudi Arabia. Oh.... the agreement also freed up more oil to the US, but I guess the Saudies are blowing Trump a little better than Iran.
1505 2018-12-31 20:54:30 I need to get me an Audi boo so that I can finesse these $100 oil changes.
1506 2018-12-31 20:54:28 I found another nail tech that uses hot towels after doing your nails. I could cry I’m so happy. The only thing I pray she starts doing is the hot oil on your cuticles & the hand massage.
1507 2018-12-31 20:54:27 Both true enough statements with a reasonable conclusion to start with.

But the problem is that CO2 is a huge problem that is not getting the attention that it needs due to the oil industry, corrupt politicians and a 4th estate that is beholden to maintaining this.
1508 2018-12-31 20:54:18 I love Sierra's work, it's beautiful. My mom was very artistic as well. She passed in 2008 and her artwork (oil paintings) are some of my most prized possessions 
1509 2018-12-31 20:54:00 I haven’t stopped studying how ALL markets since losing a big trade. Stayed up for a week studying and learning from OGs on YouTube, Reddit and Discord. I know how to trade corn, oil, metals or tech companies now.

Looking for a sure thing Pot Coin to drop a rack on.

1511 2018-12-31 20:53:48 Boy am I happy they specified that it was expeller-pressed canola oil, as if anyone (maybe almost anyone) eating their burgers would know the difference between mechanical and hexane extracted oils . Just trying to make it sound fancy?

1514 2018-12-31 20:53:28 While going to get my oil changed at a drive-in spot, I was reminded of a tweet where a husband was shocked to find out his wife put off getting gas b/c the experience leaves one open to men who think it's a great time for flirting and conversation.
1515 2018-12-31 20:53:17 it’s meant to be raw, you put the meat in the pot and it cooks it because it’s filled with oil 
1516 2018-12-31 20:53:13 When your oil changing dude tells you you have something in your teeth. Bye 2018, we’re done 
1517 2018-12-31 20:53:07 Just use a slight bit of oil brushes on to give the crispness.  Air fryer is awesome
1518 2018-12-31 20:53:05 They’re really great with olive oil and garlic. Then roast them at 450 for 45 minutes to an hour!!! Also, you can do spicy ones also, they’re amazing with Siracha
1519 2018-12-31 20:53:04 So. . .

1524 2018-12-31 20:51:46 Have also started CBD oil for anxiety , so far am super happy with the results. Just 5 drops a day because I am hypersensitive to meds :) worth a try. You can get it online
1525 2018-12-31 20:51:35 @Sanmi_sway your avi sir 
Is that the mavins contract or the forte oil endorsement ?
1526 2018-12-31 20:51:26 oh god my sausage bun i think i heated it a little too long and it fucking squirted oil everywhere this is obscene
1527 2018-12-31 20:51:24 Can I just say a very big thank you to you and @Paul_Cornell for "Hammer House of Podcast" which is an absolute delight. But, more importantly, try slicing courgettes into rounds, tossing in oil, and griddling until a little bit charred on each side. These are GOOD courgettes.
1528 2018-12-31 20:51:21 Absolutely, we need the truth, not the half truth to make a fast buck for some investors, not the half truth to protect oil barons, but the actual one.
1529 2018-12-31 20:51:18 《オリーブ油豆知識》

酸化されにくいオレイン酸を多く含む

1530 2018-12-31 20:51:14 Yeah, all that man made carbon sitting on top of seas, seeping under water, adding gas pressure to the point of forcing eruption. Germany should clamp hard on India, China, and Indonesia to leave coal and oil in the ground, stop moving forward.
1531 2018-12-31 20:51:13 Yep and thanks for providing the reason why. Gas should be scrapped too btw. We need clean, modern energy. Nuclear energy is the currently best alternative. Others will come. Evolution moves on whether you and oil globalists like it or not.
1532 2018-12-31 20:51:03 I know most of that, some of which may be political propaganda mixed with truth. I followed a bit, like when Marie Colvin went there in 2012 & was murdered, along with French photog. Plus confusion about who was friendly/enemy. And the fight for oil pipeline through region.
1533 2018-12-31 20:50:52 You know anything about radiation, like could it be creating pockets of radiation in clouds like how oil don't mix well with water

All I got is theories and speculation. If space traveling Aliens where real, I think they would have figured out how to take over a planet by now
1534 2018-12-31 20:50:50 Oil palm was 50
1535 2018-12-31 20:50:45 Dire needs more seed oil. Totally ignores the insanely large amount of Pam's HarvestCraft gardens that would give plenty of squeezable seeds just breaking them!
1536 2018-12-31 20:50:44 Cast iron pan.  10 min pre heat.  Neutral oil for the pan (grapeseed works).  Sear.  Finish in oven.
1537 2018-12-31 20:50:44 Yea and when the realization of the Massive Increase in electrical power generation that would be required to replace even 1/4 of the cars and 1/4 of the heating along with the Millions of products made from Oil alone will cause cognitive dissonance ...
1538 2018-12-31 20:50:44 Naija was already in an economic crisis under Shagari when he was toppled, thanks to rampant corruption, a mass expulsion of foreigners, pro-IMF austerity, infrastructure neglect, and the post-OPEC embargo collapse in oil prices.

1550 2018-12-31 20:49:27 Al Gore as we now know him to be should run for the office he actually won 20 years ago so we can work as hard as possibly can to stave off the worst of Climate Change. Had we done this 20 years ago we would already be solar and wind powered. Instead... two oil men took office...

Imagine the kin development level we for Dey now, see SA where ur pple Dey run go. I will rather prefer white to be Nigeria president than the current lifeless 76 yrs old failure
1553 2018-12-31 20:48:45 This isn’t that important. Oil and gas workers killing themselves because they can’t find work, now that’s important.
1554 2018-12-31 20:48:40 Which essential oil makes you productive
1555 2018-12-31 20:48:30 I wouldn't but I need some black eyed peas, chicken wings and oil. Might as well pick up some of the other household stuff while I'm out and about. UGH.

I hate Bernie because he's selling snake oil. Usually at someone else's expense.
1559 2018-12-31 20:48:09 We can spend trillions on them getting tax cuts, on defense contractors, subsidies for oil companies, but universal health care is socialism. People should get health care before corporations get more breaks. But that’s just terrible.
1560 2018-12-31 20:48:09 SportingEndless war? Who said that but you making shit up as you go. If it isn't a crime against humanity stay the hell out. Selling of arms is, taking oil rights is not human rights. STFU

1567 2018-12-31 20:47:17 Scientists aren't discussing whether or not climate change is happening. They're discussing how we can deal with it. It's not an open question. But you'd rather that a few oil barons get richer while the world burns.
1568 2018-12-31 20:47:15 I’m doing asmr in the Walmart oil change waiting room. It’s just me eating carrots really loudly next to some people/fans

1574 2018-12-31 20:46:47 It takes time.  Allow yourself some time.

Do one thing at a time to make your whole body healthy. not too overwhelming. five min walk. blueberry. fish oil. Soothing bath.  Green tea. chocolate.  

It may seem impossible, but you'll feel better soon this is temporary.
1575 2018-12-31 20:46:23 under klein, the cons set aside a fund to help get alberta out of its boom n busy economy (ie: away from oil & gas) it seems like people either forgot that, or never knew 

1576 2018-12-31 20:46:14 He needs to sign an endorsement deal with Valvoline and change the oil in his hair every 5,000 games.
1577 2018-12-31 20:46:07 You’re kinda making yourself unnecessary by showing up with the oil and the penguin.
1578 2018-12-31 20:45:43 The one bright spot for gov anyway is it does bump up tax revenue for state, fed, SS, Medicare
1579 2018-12-31 20:45:40 It would reshape the British S.I.S. and dragons, of the oil wars.
1580 2018-12-31 20:45:38 If they open drilling in the Article Wilderness preserve, they'll have to build giant roads for a continuous stream of huge trucks. It'll kill off polar bears&divide migratory elk herds,killing off every living thing.And they say we can't burn that oil w/out frying the planet.
1581 2018-12-31 20:45:34 Can somebody teach me how to cook this cornflakes. I have all the ingredients, pepper, onions, garlic, oil, what more do I need?  Help a sister out please.
1582 2018-12-31 20:45:05 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1583 2018-12-31 20:44:51 I had some with dinner  I used olive oil, chipotle pepper, garlic and sprinkled the smallest amount of mozzarella. YUMMM

1586 2018-12-31 20:44:29 Seems to be leaking oil somewhere: Pels twice as high team VORP over Magic & worse record. My guess: Some ind VORP's are basically worthless, not really helping Pels to W's, the stat equivalent of junk food
1587 2018-12-31 20:44:29 LE talent ahah ! Midnight oil donc
1588 2018-12-31 20:44:23 It was bad. I didn’t want us to poison ourselves. I’ll get us a new bottle with some fresh olive oil. 
1589 2018-12-31 20:44:09 RT SecretaryPerry: In 2018, the United States became the world’s leading producer of oil as well as natural gas -- exporting our LNG to 32 countries on five continents -- and we remain a world leader in using energy more cleanly and more efficiently.  #YearInReview

1593 2018-12-31 20:43:50 Like I’m so mad. $600 
That’s more than the rent itself. 

+ having to buy oil for the place?? 

It’s just me and my fiancé. How can anyone afford that???
1594 2018-12-31 20:43:43 Are you kidding me? Benchmarks are down almost 30% in the last two-thirds months. Oil is trading only marginally better than it was in 15, shortly after the last downswing lol
1595 2018-12-31 20:43:34 I will gladly pay a carbon or cap-and-trade tax to protect future generations and because economists and big industry say it's BEST way to cut greenhouse gas emissions! Gas prices are down due to oil glut! Meanwhile, Ford shd #RefundOurGasTax he stole!

1598 2018-12-31 20:43:21 Where can I get the oil
1599 2018-12-31 20:42:51 Green Leftists are just like us with our weird litmus tests for what qualifies as a legit candidate!

They just have silly ones like if the candidate took money from oil companies!
1600 2018-12-31 20:42:28 Without that oil and gas how on earth would our law makers and celebrities fly their private jets and heat their huge mansions until they give up their luxuries I’ll continue to drive my gas guzzling truck besides I’m not ready to live in a cave
1601 2018-12-31 20:42:25 What...what is this music? I feel like I should be concerned about an oil spill or something. Donating money to a disaster. Tonally: very confusing.

1608 2018-12-31 20:41:59 There is no such thing as an egalitarian oligarchy. The Lords and Ladies of the aristocracy may be equal, but they'll make sure the rest of us are at one another's throats. How else can a few steal everything? Neoliberal progressivism is snake oil.

1616 2018-12-31 20:41:00 They have to Leave one day. And the Kurds have already all the oil and Water supplies+30% of the Country. Best Cards to Play Poker. The US can withdraw i would say.
1617 2018-12-31 20:41:00 literally every single fave is problematic. Beto took $490,000 from oil&gas (to clarify) still fucking love him and his messages and i’d vote for him for prez over almost anybody but like fuuuuuuuuuck come on man

1623 2018-12-31 20:40:25 I had a very severe case for @ four years.  I believe that I healed it by taking a good quality fish oil.   Mine was caused by sinus infections and blows to the head area.  It made me crazy, but it's gone.
1624 2018-12-31 20:40:24 You do realize there are many industries in BC that are dependent on oil.
1625 2018-12-31 20:40:19 Is the most gutter trash shit written on Twitter all year.

Are you kidding?

And her oil analogy is crackhead talk.

But I'll flip that analogy like this; Trump is synthetic oil, maintaining protective qualities for 40k miles.

The Paris Accord withdrawal is a prime example.

1635 2018-12-31 20:39:17 Higher paid jobs are often more stressful and dangerous, and there are more males than females work in those environments, like being a firefighter or work in oil field
1636 2018-12-31 20:39:04 No, rosehip is like a fruit from a plant. I tried rose water, and it broke me OUT. Rosehip oil, is good for scars I heard your hair too but I’ve never tried it for that

1638 2018-12-31 20:38:58 In this particular field, sure. But if you put me in a warehouse, or on a ship, or an oil rig and had me doing 'unskilled labor', I wouldn't be able to do it. I'm not more or less skilled than the average - I just have skills in a particular area.
1639 2018-12-31 20:38:52 I got jalapeño oil in my eye and I know this is punishment for all the times I’ve made fun of people who can’t handle spicy.
1640 2018-12-31 20:38:47 You do realize that oil is used for more then running a car and heating your home. If your so against oil don’t go to a hospital because they are 95% dependent on petrochemicals and there is no green alternative.

1649 2018-12-31 20:37:38 Terrible analogy.  And yes, we desperately need to make renewable energy sources economically viable.  We subsidize the hell out of the oil industry when they make plenty of money to begin with.  The sooner renewable energy is profitable the better it will be for everyone.

1653 2018-12-31 20:36:45 There one oil name that’s not a big divy payer. They have good PPS growth while maintaining good expense control. CF is growing and they don’t raise much money. Management sits around 22-25% ownership which puts the aligned with retail holders. Management is very knowledgeable
1654 2018-12-31 20:36:31 $RIG 2019 Oil Rebounds from its lows to set new 2019 highs. New budgets and spending from large oil companies more upside. $9-$11 Target
1655 2018-12-31 20:36:30 So have you gone vegan yet, to show how pro-life you are? Stopped driving to slow global warming? Stopped supporting oil wars by voting republican? Or are the only life issues you care about the ones that limit rights for women?
1656 2018-12-31 20:36:12 I'm upset with CNBrown company because they told my gram they couldn't deliver oil even thou there coming to our town tomorrow anyway and that she can carry 5 gallon barrels to fill if she needs it so bad, she's in her 70' s she can't lift those heavy barrels and they know it.

1662 2018-12-31 20:35:44 Schumer can't do that and isn't doing that.  Republicans (right now) hold all three branches of government.  It's just Trump dishing out sh!t, hoping his base will buy it.  He's always been a snake oil salesman, but some don't (won't) see it.

1665 2018-12-31 20:35:21 If you are going to ask serious questions on the Middle East, start with the impact of US consumption of oil & opium. Then go to US & EU involvement in their countries and the wars. Your Christianity comment is naive and ignorant.
1666 2018-12-31 20:35:00 I made oil for my family for New Years 
1667 2018-12-31 20:34:56 Would it apply to purchase of another car? Either way it’s a great example of @elonmusk being a total snake oil salesman. “Don’t worry, you don’t need to test drive just hit buy and we will refund if you don’t like”
1668 2018-12-31 20:34:42 You’re wrong ab climate change being important to Dems. If that were true why do the majority of them accept donations from fossil fuel companies? Why did Obama extract more gas & oil than Bush? Why is Third Way so eager to support Beto? Wall St makes a fortune on ff speculation.

1670 2018-12-31 20:34:28 It’s more exp to buy ready-made gf food. So u really need to learn to cook. I pair boiled greens with sardines (only in olive oil)/grilled or sautéd mushrooms (taste like meat once you get used to it). No bread, no pasta, no white rice.
1671 2018-12-31 20:34:23 i dont normally desire any herbs.. like.. im hot for parsley.. or i crave sage.. even cheap chinese soup pckgs (Yum Yum)[ which btw is a character in The Mikado!] have lil spice bags, flavoured oil, chili powder, etc.. but i will survive it.. 
1672 2018-12-31 20:34:21 Engine oil?
1673 2018-12-31 20:34:20 Sun flower and coconut oil works wonders
1674 2018-12-31 20:34:15 This is rich coming from the guy that lauds the greatest snake oil salesman of the last 50 years: Trump. People in glass houses should not throw stones.
1675 2018-12-31 20:34:15 it's a Council that relies on oil shares for their pension pot.
1676 2018-12-31 20:34:14 Hahaha bhai aalmi mandy main oil 13.45 rs km howwe hai apka kmal bhi h is may
1677 2018-12-31 20:33:57 To all the oil/gas traders and analysts out there. And to all those that use #OOTT May 2019 be a good year for everyone. 

It has been an interesting year and it has been great to learn from you.

Happy 2019

1678 2018-12-31 20:33:52 You didn’t build this is a part of his legacy Sir. That was not an atteck on you in any way. It holds up if you ask me. He said we would not be able to reach last quarters growth rate or our current situation in oil production. Now he wants to take credit.
1679 2018-12-31 20:33:51 Sand paper and engine oil... Innovation
1680 2018-12-31 20:33:37 I sure hope so.
1681 2018-12-31 20:33:29 Think you got some oil on your skirt.
1682 2018-12-31 20:33:13 Are you sure the reason why your bringing back the troop isn’t because of oil  and making a deal with Russia and that Syria guy ?
1683 2018-12-31 20:32:40 新年早々ガイジ(￣･ω･￣)
前からいた人か。
1684 2018-12-31 20:32:31 If I'm making a base for bolognese, I always use chopped onions, celery, carrot , garlic , rosemary and thyme sweated in olive oil
1685 2018-12-31 20:31:52 She certainly doesn't call out Israel for bombing Palestinian children or Trump when she votes for his defense budget raises. She also didn't call out the oil companies assaulting the land and people at DAPL

1687 2018-12-31 20:31:44 Coconut oil or baby oil, what's your preference?
1688 2018-12-31 20:31:20 OIL RULES!!!!!
1689 2018-12-31 20:31:10 I hear a lot about the oil, but I have been on prescription narcotics since 11th grade and I’m not sure if I could get the oil to be strong enough to handle my rheumatoid arthritis, the disfigurement from the arthritis, my osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, & my anxiety and insomnia.
1690 2018-12-31 20:30:58 So why the Brouhaha over low oil prices and the blaming of the Fed. liberals?? You can't have it both ways.  You all are trying to turf Trudeau over this yet claim the low gas prices are all your doing..  ok then...
1691 2018-12-31 20:30:53 I woke up with a toothache a
on New year's eve.  called to get some clove oil. They answered the phone, even though they were closed. Told me to come in and get some. Highly recommend this Awesome store.
1692 2018-12-31 20:30:49 And the owners of the pipeline as without government intervention it was going to cost them a fortune due to level of opposition to it.

I'd rather that he hadn't intervened as well because I want to see the pipeline ripped up not added to. The world needs to stop using oil now.
1693 2018-12-31 20:30:48 Gotta learn to hate the snake oil salesmen ;)
1694 2018-12-31 20:30:35 i became a mother already it takes 40$ to fill her up, 15$ for a bath, and 150$ for her oil changes.. im out

1697 2018-12-31 20:30:16 Bate let’s debate the Iraq issue from legitimacy of the war to instability and oil theft. Forget about who is the mouthpiece but the statement as fact or fiction
1698 2018-12-31 20:30:16 For the year:
Dow.       -8%
Dollar:  +4.5%
Crude:  -26%
Corn:    +6.8%
Soy:       -7%
Chi wh:  +20%
Kc wh:    +15%

Sorrow goes to those in the N Plains with soy or HRS plus an IRA of equities. (And an oil well)
1699 2018-12-31 20:30:12 I’m all hot and bothered. Coconut oil, conditioner and PornHub, here I come.
1700 2018-12-31 20:30:09 That's a bold statement of from Spec... especially given Nicholson said he just has to make it
1701 2018-12-31 20:30:06 CBD oil is actually life changing
1702 2018-12-31 20:30:04 I purchased the leave in and the curling custard and fell in love!!!!!!! I paired it with olive oil and my wash and go lasted over 7 days
1703 2018-12-31 20:30:00 my mom took my car to enid to get the oil changed and while my car was at the shop SOMEONE BACKED INTO MY CAR
1704 2018-12-31 20:30:00 @VW - Getting my oil changed at the dealer.  Sad to see virtually no manual transmission options.  How about bringing a stick shift SUV over from Europe?  I'd buy that.

Love my GLI, but would prefer an SUV.  No stick, no buy.  Dying breed.
1705 2018-12-31 20:29:36 Slather yourself in Vick’s like I mean slather so much you look like a bottle of baby oil.. Chicken soup with buckets of hot sauce. FEEL BETTER MY QUEEN.
1706 2018-12-31 20:29:35 If he sells snake oil what does Trump sell?  Deficit insurance I hope.
1707 2018-12-31 20:29:24 Oil may be huge money for some companies but for the workers it’s just above average. They are barely getting back on their feet from the last slow down which they used their savings to make it  through, and have seen wages only go down since then.
1708 2018-12-31 20:29:16 #joinin had a NYE bath, now relaxing with scented candles and oil burner and about to get some wine. Trying to focus on the positives of the year and to remind myself of the fact I do have friends and that people care about me. Hope everyone’s ok 
1709 2018-12-31 20:29:06 Both Russia and China are working to create an alternative to the $US as a reserve currency. It stands a chance because of Russia's vast reserves of hydrocarbons, like oil.

Rumor in financial circles is that they are working on an asset-backed (eg gold) currency competitor.
1710 2018-12-31 20:29:04 You gotta be leaking serious oil to get fired before the start of conference play.
1711 2018-12-31 20:28:56 So we should shut down our oil industry so those other “nicer” countries can supply us? And if it’s such a dead industry why is demand increasing?
1712 2018-12-31 20:28:45 @BetoORourke tweeted and ppl rushed to the greyhound bus station to fill the every need of illegal aliens. They never give these Americans any thought.  @codeofvets @GarySiniseFound @Tunnel2Towers
1713 2018-12-31 20:28:37 Trump is a snake oil salesman
1714 2018-12-31 20:28:32 Like the 1/2 million from Israeli lobbyists and millions from the oil war industries?
1715 2018-12-31 20:28:32 Oil sands do not destroy ecosystems - an outright lie. 

Again why import oil by diesel tankers accross the ocean when environment at risk. Again why not replace coal with NG in a China and India where pollution the highest?
1716 2018-12-31 20:28:20 Tried so many products for my dry skin that didn't help. Coconut oil does the most, my skin is so beautiful
1717 2018-12-31 20:28:17 90 for an oil change is really blowing me 
1718 2018-12-31 20:28:06 Oil isn’t just used for diesel and gas. Look at your surroundings, petroleum usage in products is everywhere. Plastic is Petroleum.
1719 2018-12-31 20:28:05 last night bryce took my car to work to change my oil & gave me my car back w a full tank 
1720 2018-12-31 20:28:01 @Xadeejournalist @ZarrarKhuhro Cooking oil PR executive totally dissed your program as non-glamour and that only serious people call. Deepest condolences!
1721 2018-12-31 20:27:44 This is what happens sometimes when you burn the midnight oil.

That is an interesting way to phrase it.
1722 2018-12-31 20:27:43 She’s no Bernie but I would take her over booker or Harris or almost any other establishment dem including certain ones who broke their promise to not take oil money, google it
1723 2018-12-31 20:27:37 Is that a YOUNG DL??? Happy New Year--The year of The Weald and Cannabis Oil!!
1724 2018-12-31 20:27:17 Toy is in a small bag that zips up. I use hot soap and water to clean it. For lube I use coconut oil. Pretty basic for me.
1725 2018-12-31 20:27:13 What is a vegan alternative to Nutella that doesn’t have palm oil?!
1726 2018-12-31 20:27:12 Whenever I spot treat my acne it scars over like the next day, but I use rosehip oil for my scars
1727 2018-12-31 20:27:02 “What do you want for your birthday?”

18 year old me : clothes, shoes, jewelry.

28 year old me : can you just pay for my oil change.
1728 2018-12-31 20:27:00 Someone just made +6.28% on WCX: buy WTI Crude Oil 45.556 → 45.699 (20x leverage)  ~ CUTE $WTICO $USD
1729 2018-12-31 20:26:38 Thinking of athlete as an engine

Every winter we refresh oil in our family waverunner. Anti-freeze, all necessary updates & “correctives.”

We don’t drive/open it up

Come spring, if we take it out & hammer it it’ll implode. See where I’m going?

Don’t train in bubble wrap
1730 2018-12-31 20:26:35 this is just oil to the fire
1731 2018-12-31 20:26:13 No I am taking care of my health,  even cutting out sugar and cooking oil.... pity I have to go to work. Also a very unhealthy environment with all that daily commuting...
1732 2018-12-31 20:26:10 Truth is we have lost 3 opportunities to reform (at least the oil sector and remove subsidy) in Nigeria. 1. Obasanjo 2001 to 2002. 2. Jonathan 2012 (he should have stuck to his gun. 3. Buhari 2015-2016.
1733 2018-12-31 20:25:49 the highlight of 2018 is when @jccaylen was saying THATS SO MUCH OIL
1734 2018-12-31 20:25:34 Snake Oil. Like Apples to Apples but 100x more hilarious
1735 2018-12-31 20:25:26 Your climate plan is clear... Kill Canadian oil and import everything..
1736 2018-12-31 20:25:23 Or better for those already working those jobs?
1737 2018-12-31 20:25:12 Daha ne yapsam iyi olurdu ya.anlattık söyledik yaşadık. İyi yıllar hepsini kapa yeni yılda bakarız. Bakiye kalmasın karla alalım. 47 üstüne zıplarsa satarız dedik olmadı. Yeni yıl yeni oyun bakarız. Oyun bitti 22k ile bende #crudeoil #usoil #oil
1738 2018-12-31 20:24:51 Oh god, I tipped over my jar of “Dangerous Oil.” This sucks!
1739 2018-12-31 20:24:16 2. As well as all oil having to be purchased using the $US. This means that there is a permanent, artificial demand for dollars. In turn, this means that other nations must trade with the US in order to acquire dollars.
1740 2018-12-31 20:24:13 You understand the reason for this, right? Alberta has, the highest per capita income & GDP in the country, by far. We are one country. Just because Alberta happens to be sitting on oil shouldn't mean the people here should get better services than those in other parts.1/
1741 2018-12-31 20:24:06 Walking into the new year with a fresh oil change feels sexier than I thought
1742 2018-12-31 20:24:05 It must be an old Syrian recipe. Fried onions, garlic, olive oil, salt & pepper, black eyed peas & broccoli
1743 2018-12-31 20:24:01 As far as I know, the oral use of #hemp oil is not allowed in Europe; do you know if there is any news about this?
#hempoil
1744 2018-12-31 20:23:53 The is an excellent idea. I will register DaveAir on Wednesday and look forward to my first government contract for flying medicines, food and olive oil into the UK
1745 2018-12-31 20:23:53 My dad asked me why I’m sweating so much I told him it’s oil 
1746 2018-12-31 20:23:26 tea tree oil is strong as shit. 
1747 2018-12-31 20:23:15 I can see tesla stock doing a blow off top false breakout in 2019 like oil and copper did.  Oil broke out above 72 and blew off top at 75-76 and fell to 42 at the low 3 months later. Copper blew off top at 3.30 few months ago and now well below that. $400 breakout, then $100
1748 2018-12-31 20:23:08 You also kept your promise of phasing out the oil sands.
1749 2018-12-31 20:22:48 My New Years Day wish:
Everyone in Washington DC gets administered a Hemp & CBD oil enema before reporting for work.
1750 2018-12-31 20:22:47 The looting started from the oil boom era.
1751 2018-12-31 20:22:40 1. From a human, and global perspective it is one of the great evils. It is the secret deal between Saudi Arabia and the US that says the US will buy oil from the Saudis, so long as they reinvest the dollars in US debt.
1752 2018-12-31 20:22:34 Schumer is a con artist peddling snake oil and lies. Anything he did in life he mucked up. What a dolt. He is an enemy.
1753 2018-12-31 20:22:29 Most company towns were based on extractive business — oil, mining, timbering — were located in remote areas, which created monopoly conditions for the companies that owned the towns. 

The Cadbury company, owned by a reformist Quaker family, founded Bourneville the 1st one.
1754 2018-12-31 20:22:14 Pssst, hey sinclair_pam, they aren’t reliant on our oil or money. They can buy cheap oil from the US, and the taxes raised here are nice, but they would survive without us. On the other hand, those of us in Alberta would be screwed. Land locked and overly dependent on oil.
1755 2018-12-31 20:22:07 Noraheuer @ are you someone who believes you can retrain and invest with the twitch of a nose. That would take yrs and wind farms and sun panels don’t run the Economy. Oil does, oil from AB. Might I add oil from AB makes your life more comfortable. Ps AB doesn’t  want handouts
1756 2018-12-31 20:22:03 Next time try rubbing oil on your hands first before washing/cutting pepper
1757 2018-12-31 20:21:41 70% Vegetable Oil Spread
1758 2018-12-31 20:21:41 こちらこそ宜しくです！！
1759 2018-12-31 20:21:39 Looking forward to that carbon tax and redirecting oil company subsidies to green research.
1760 2018-12-31 20:21:39 2/2: And net imports from Canada were 3.128 million b/d. Which means that if you take that out, the U.S. was a net exporter to the entire world, by a lot. Every time I figured the number had hit a bottom, it fooled me again. #oil #oott
1761 2018-12-31 20:21:28 Lowest ever, by a lot: U.S. net petroleum imports in October were 1.399 million b/d. That's down about 800,000 b/d from the month before. Lowest by far in the history of the data going back to 1973. Peak month? Aug 2006, 13.4 million b/d. #oil #oott
1762 2018-12-31 20:21:25 CBD oil helps too. Hang in there!
1763 2018-12-31 20:21:20 As a tech on Oil and Gas, if something blows up, we have failed, and failed badly.  We work had to ensure that does not happen.
1764 2018-12-31 20:21:15 Must be that special blend of Columbian gold that Pablo smuggles in and they mix in the oil.. Also would explain why Democrats spend $500,000 a month on their lunch bill..
1765 2018-12-31 20:21:14  Who has used CBD Oil and what has it done for you
1766 2018-12-31 20:21:12 My cat is crazy about olive everything. Olive oil, olives, olive juice that comes with that jarred olives. It's like catnip
1767 2018-12-31 20:21:11 If the President owned a piece of an oil company, foreign or domestic, well he would profit handsomely from such a decision
1768 2018-12-31 20:21:11 I’m pretty sure this is a South Asian thing but like..........the 20 minutes your mom takes to put oil in your hair is the worst yet best time ever. Because you have to bend your head at the weirdest angles but it always ends with a head massage please ignore me im rambling again
1769 2018-12-31 20:21:00 *** New Years Resolution ***
I encourage everyone to think about what you can do in 2019, to make your environment more sustainable.

 Happy New Year!!

1771 2018-12-31 20:20:45 If things don’t have fairs (I’m lactose intolerant) it has coconut oil (I’m super allergic to coconut) can never win
1772 2018-12-31 20:20:20 For the past 2 days I’ve been cooking fish in my tiny kitchen so today I decided to cook it in the shared kitchen on the floor so the smell doesn’t get stuck in my room. Now the whole kitchen and the hallway smell like fish oil.......
1773 2018-12-31 20:20:14 Stop supporting Saudi wahabi terrorists! Assad is the elected leader of Syria, your Jihadi regime change FAILED, you will not be allowed to steal Syria's oil and split the country in two. Assad has defeated ISIS in all Syria except where US forces are protecting them. GTFO!
1774 2018-12-31 20:20:11 Get you some colonial silver nose spray add 3 drops of oregano oil (Oreganol) you’ll be feeling better quick. A decent health food/ vitamin place should have both)(Provided you aren’t allergic to silver, obviously)

1779 2018-12-31 20:19:11 (3) .. I think you have some serious oil searching to do my friend as I think the way you think life should work and the actual reality are as far removed as heaven and earth.
1780 2018-12-31 20:19:10 Marina take your damn car to the shop for an oil change challenge
1781 2018-12-31 20:18:56 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
1782 2018-12-31 20:18:52 True but - maybe I'm too optimistic - I think that cynical Britons will see it as snake oil from that scoundrel.
1783 2018-12-31 20:18:26 “don’t drink anything dum-e hands you, supersoldier physiology or not, and whether or not it seems suspicious. he’s made me drink motor oil on more than one occasion.” 

he points and glares at the offending bot, though there’s no real venom behind his glare. +
1784 2018-12-31 20:18:24 Talking to other people is therapeutic... this is just oil to the fire
1785 2018-12-31 20:18:13 Yay!! We get to keep the oil, right? Wasn't that part of your victory plan??
1786 2018-12-31 20:18:11 “Honey, I’m heading to the store to get you more olive oil, a few actually. Can I also pick you up some wine & anything from the jewelry store?” 
1787 2018-12-31 20:18:10 Should start with that Bational Observer piece regarding Heavy Oil price differential.
1788 2018-12-31 20:18:07 Always wear gloves when handling any chemicals as cleaners are designed to remove oil and grease as well as the natural oils in your skin.
1789 2018-12-31 20:18:05 /2 As I said, I could be very wrong about all of this... really just trying to link up exogenous events with what I see in my charts. Charts are saying [a] dollar sinks in 2019, [b] US 10Y rate spikes to >3.6% (but less than 3.8%), [c] price of oil goes zoom...

1794 2018-12-31 20:17:49 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
1795 2018-12-31 20:17:40 Palm oil isn’t evil, it’s a fabulous crop that benefits many small producers, such as those in Thailand. Unsustainable intensive agriculture is the problem.
1796 2018-12-31 20:17:25 Oil burners is the best thing ever made 
1797 2018-12-31 20:17:20 Brilliant!

1799 2018-12-31 20:16:33 They’re taking forever just to change my oil & rotate my tires like ugh come on I’m starving
1800 2018-12-31 20:16:24 Isn't it fair to say that the near 30 cent drop we saw since the summer came from the fact that there is a global oil glut and and OPEC can't seem to agree to a cut? 5 cents doesn't seem like a big deal or something to take credit for.
1801 2018-12-31 20:16:21 No fancy quill pens in our classroom just little black wood framed slates. Had to share chalk with my desk mate. Heat was from an oil stove at the back of the class. The smart ones sat at the back!

1803 2018-12-31 20:16:12 Been there for many years.  We are each different, but what helped me was supplements: SAMe, St.John's Wort, and now some hemp oil at bedtime. Also, breathing exercises, meditation, and having things on my calendar to look forward to. (First trip, I went to Peru)
1804 2018-12-31 20:16:07 Make electric cars that run all day. It can be done. Which in turn shuts down oil and gas as we know it. This solves major part of problem. Not hard. Wait. We don’t have those kind of electric cars but can put man on moon. Weird.  It’s proven we can’t let auto/oil industry fail
1805 2018-12-31 20:16:04 We just added CBD oil to our product line. More info to come!

Asking for a friend
1808 2018-12-31 20:15:41 Hello Thrivy. Let me guess.... on your way back from the fruit and veg section in Asda. You thought you’d buy Snake oil Phil’s “online course” seeing as he’d reduced the price. Now he wants to charge you another $99.99 for a Jyotisha reading. And you are raging?
1809 2018-12-31 20:15:38 @portilloshotdog @johnsroastpork 
Office wager between the @Eagles and the @ChicagoBears game. Best Italian beef vs. best cheesesteak. Both uncontested. Will both sides ship to each other?  We collect the oil for both stadiums. How’bout we visit your companies for that as well?
1810 2018-12-31 20:15:36 Why Guyana? (OIL,OIL,OIL,OIL,OIL)
1811 2018-12-31 20:15:31 No one is shutting your oil down... quit listening to scheer/kenney/bernier and the loudest Rempel! They would be in the same boat or break laws to push it through! Where is all the money you made? Oil is huge money, why isn't it saved for emergencies? U r promoting division!

1814 2018-12-31 20:15:19 I say olive oil because it doesn’t really have a taste but it just makes everything soggy lol. Another thing you could try is having peanuts and just eating them regularly while you work/study etc
1815 2018-12-31 20:15:17 I know, EE was cancelled because TC said it was only profitable when oil was over $100/bbl. #BandB_ABs, on the other hand thinks it's the LPC and ABNDP fault. It's hard to debate facts to people who don't want to listen.
1816 2018-12-31 20:15:17 I was making stir fry with beef (because it was the only available meat and I'm broke af). Instead of doing the smart thing, I dropped beef into a hot pan full of hot oil. Needless to say, the oil exploded and I had 2nd degree burns on my arm.
1817 2018-12-31 20:15:13 Get him a lemon, some olive oil, and pepper instead.
1818 2018-12-31 20:15:05 That argon oil is the best. Stopped my hair from falling out
1819 2018-12-31 20:14:55 Interviewed media contact for a trucker rally. He spent several hours reading online and was convinced he had the constitutional law thing all figured. Easy fix. PMJT just refused to do it because he hates oil, Alberta. Okie dokie, then.
1820 2018-12-31 20:14:41 No oil = no money for science...stop the name calling....it's very disrespectful!

1825 2018-12-31 20:14:15 Could your depression be worse because of Seasonal Affective Disorder? I have clinical depression and I know what you're talking about. Also GAD and inattentive ADHD. I found adding full spectrum CBD oil helped to boost everything.
1826 2018-12-31 20:14:13 This guy reminds me of a snake oil salesman

1828 2018-12-31 20:13:40 What is CBD oil? (thread)
1829 2018-12-31 20:13:37 Really? What was the exchange rate in those years when oil averaged $50/bl? They cld still hv completed not less than 3. Ok, from 2010, what happened? 5 years and oil averaged $105/bl. What happened again? Kontinu.
1830 2018-12-31 20:13:35 Olive oil, salt and pepper, super hot oven.  They’re like French fries.
1831 2018-12-31 20:13:15 No scientist would ever say "the science is settled" that politician speak.

1833 2018-12-31 20:13:08 Happy New Year.  One way to mitigate the effects of Dutch disease in oil rich economies like #Azerbaijan : Invest in education. Ensure quality and learning.
1834 2018-12-31 20:13:05 I wouldn’t approve a damn thing for a con artist, snake oil salesman of a POTUS with a 39% approval rating who’s an unindicted co-conspirator.
1835 2018-12-31 20:13:04 Dude and the kitchen smells like fuckin dick in here. Cigs, oil and dirty man smell.

1838 2018-12-31 20:12:28 I am such a slut for my essential oil diffusers I love them TEW much
1839 2018-12-31 20:12:27 I can appreciate that as well.

But that drop is small compared to the $1,092 ($0.35 x 60L x 52 weeks) that will be saved due to the drop in global oil prices.

Mr. Cho's tweet would have you believe that most of those savings are due to cancelling Cap&Trade, which is false.
1840 2018-12-31 20:12:16 should i have to go to my kitchen pantry when i need my coconut oil to remove my eye make up or go under my bathroom sink every time i need coco oil for a recipe?

1843 2018-12-31 20:11:37 Friendly PSA for #NewYearsEve: If you’re out and about tonight drinking, please tip your bartenders well. They’d love nothing more than to be out with friends and family, but they’ll be burning the midnight oil for you all. A little generosity goes one hell of a long way. Cheers!
1844 2018-12-31 20:11:33 Absolutly build those pipelines. If those wall street old oil fushias want to keep the past in mind, guess what, We know things about electricity that were only dreamt of in your philosophy granddad.
1845 2018-12-31 20:11:21 I co-sign the cold compress and peppermint oil method. I also take tramadol for mine
1846 2018-12-31 20:11:20 I think tucker is right there is an optimal carb/fat/protein ratio for hyperphagia and fat storage... it's 60% fat in mice but I think closer to 55% for humans (Not much different)... this is what will happen it the world turns Vegan.  lower protein, higher veg oil. peak obesity.
1847 2018-12-31 20:11:13 Hey that's great...we can send our oil to the Pacific market and do it even more efficiently with 2 pipelines headed west. Doh--forgot about the 2015 election. PS @stephenharper did all the heavy lifting on this deal.
1848 2018-12-31 20:11:05 Get with it, Senator! The current GOP is the only group ON EARTH that doesn’t believe in climate change. The military considers it a major threat, why don’t you? Is it the oil money?
1849 2018-12-31 20:11:01 Also we don't reward abusers of human rights. Also why do we need to give them better deals? We don't have to buy their oil.
1850 2018-12-31 20:11:00 Fave meal of the week! I make the dough and sauce then freeze into portions.

320ml water
500g 00 flour
7g yeast
1 tsp salt
2 tbsp olive oil

Makes 4 x thin bases. Prove for 1+ hour in warm place. Roll on greaseproof. Preheat pizza stone on full temp for 30+ mins. Cook ~5-6 mins
1851 2018-12-31 20:10:46 How could it not...when you can shave off the oil pan to be more aerodynamic and hide and extra couple of feet of fuel line....i mean....it is next level!
1852 2018-12-31 20:10:19 (*｀ω´*)ﾄﾞﾔｱｱ
1853 2018-12-31 20:10:12 This can happen if oil goes back to 70-80 level
1854 2018-12-31 20:10:09 Warning on the back of my husband’s BEARD oil “do not use if pregnant” ...okay?
1855 2018-12-31 20:10:07 Okay okay I learned something new! I heard about people using olive oil in all their foods to increase the caloric intake, maybe try that? Seeing as how coffee isn’t leaving you anytime soon

1857 2018-12-31 20:10:01 Americans and Europeans should boycott Russia. That includes any businesses, oil or products.
1858 2018-12-31 20:09:44 You should tell everyone that you’re bought by big oil when you tweet at these articles.

1860 2018-12-31 20:09:27 The use of palm oil is decimating Polynesia and the south pacific.
1861 2018-12-31 20:09:27 Why would any sane person approve of any appointment of yours? 

Oil industry lobbyist Scott Pruitt as head of the EPA?

Anti-education Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary?

Rabid Conservative and sexual predator Brett Kavanaugh as SCOTUS justice?

Have a fun 2019, asshole.
1862 2018-12-31 20:08:47 @Billbrowder I've just read Red Notice in a day....gripping and terrifying. Given your career effectively took off on Russian oil, can you not round the circle by now taking on the fossil fuel industry? Please do see a few of @PaulHBeckwith YouTube's to grasp where we headed.
1863 2018-12-31 20:08:41 If they have the biggest oil reserves in the world why are they eating leather and dogs? Venezuela used to be a powerhouse but guess what changed. Their government.
1864 2018-12-31 20:08:40 Hadrian’s Wall was built in the 2nd Century AD to keep the Celts out of Roman England. Wasn’t very efficient, moats and boiling oil were used in the Middle Ages.

1872 2018-12-31 20:07:37 1. But a $80K MB, BMW, or Lexus to drive sit at your office job is a-ok? 2. Did you ask what a "welding" truck was at Starbucks today? 3. Do you support an oil tanker moratorium on the east coast 4. What about stop dumping raw sewage in the St. L River?

1878 2018-12-31 20:06:58 Oil prices averaged under $55pb till about 2006. The funds haven't always been much. The boom/ "enough funds" was from 2010-2014.

1883 2018-12-31 20:06:40 Nope. This is decline in oil prices colliding with slowdown in manufacturing exacerbated by heat coming off following panic buying ahead of threatened increase in Chinese imports that never materialized.
1884 2018-12-31 20:06:32 The message is very clear!
1885 2018-12-31 20:06:32 I put too much oil on my legs... oops
1886 2018-12-31 20:06:29 After checking EVERYTHING in cupboard, I add a few drops of clove oil to the water I’m using to wash down shelves, crevices etc. then put a few drops on cotton balls and scatter through shelves along with bay leaves.
1887 2018-12-31 20:06:08 A oil change cost me $50 wtf type of shit is that.
1888 2018-12-31 20:06:07 You suppose to wash all your clothes, clean your house, anoint your doorways with oil, make black eye peas - if you a woman the first man to come thru your door gotta have money in his pocket. He can be related to you...this just my grandma recipe for a good year
1889 2018-12-31 20:05:46 we oil pulling, flossing, brushing our teeth AND scrubbing our tongues all 2019. okay?
1890 2018-12-31 20:05:45 Have you visited Venezuela that was brought down by "Populism"?, a bag of Spuds now costs $150 on the black market, it is not a Socialist Country it was taken over by Maduro after the Oil Crash.
1891 2018-12-31 20:05:22 Not sure where you stand on this but his buyout of the pipeline was a gift to the oil industry (especially the Exxon inheritors who run it) as not doing so would have meant no pipeline (a good result).

1895 2018-12-31 20:04:38 When DEA burnt down Caro Quinteros weed farm, the produce was  worth $2.5b .....there were oil fields in Saudi Arabia worth less.

Damn
1896 2018-12-31 20:04:35 Thank you @BlairKing_ca !  The fact that California (US) is buying our oil, storing it even, at such a discount is something many anti-pipeline people just don’t want to realize.

1900 2018-12-31 20:03:43 last decade more than AB receives back in services. This also continued through our worst recession in a long time. Norway is also a small country, (5 million pop) and very homogeneous compared to Canada. And it's whole country is behind the Oil and Gas that enriches them...

5. Have Them
6. Have Many Words
1904 2018-12-31 20:03:00 In the 60’s you could not see across the street in Houston because of all the smog. Pasadena had all of the oil refineries. They started cleaning it up in the 70’s. And new cars had catalytic converters. It was a wonderful transformation.  There may be CO2 but the air is clear.
1905 2018-12-31 20:02:59 it's also a sign of decency not to wear one. I have yet to see one in public here in Tucson Arizona. And the last right-wing talk radio station closed down. True, it's now 24/7 Christianity, but at least that's not like an oil spill of hatred.
1906 2018-12-31 20:02:56 Roswell and Hobbs are the big producers in the state. I don't go there! It's stinky, and ,most of the oil people I've met are Rude & Rich!
1907 2018-12-31 20:02:56 Willful ignorance or bought n paid for by oil companies?
1908 2018-12-31 20:02:53 Govt employees haven’t even missed a paycheck yet. His loss is sad but has zero to do with govt shutdown.
1909 2018-12-31 20:02:42 You think a federal minimum wage of $15 would be more or less of a magnet for illegal immigrants?
1910 2018-12-31 20:02:36 I hope good oil cooperation between the two countries in the new year!
1911 2018-12-31 20:02:19 I hope you feel better If it helps I always put Lavender oil on my temples and wrists to help with head pain. The sent also is very calming! Get well soon 
1912 2018-12-31 20:02:18 I honestly have no clue as to why coconut oil was EVER considered healthy. I've been saying all along that I'm glad to see so many vegan products being marketed, but dismayed at how many of them boast "Gluten-free! Soy-free!" but are made from coconut oil.
1913 2018-12-31 20:02:16 Did You Know? A single quart of motor oil, if disposed improperly, can contaminate up to 2,000,000 gallons of fresh water.
1914 2018-12-31 20:02:15 #Libya rumors of capture of Ibrahim AlHadran, on the southern border, he is the terrorist & leader of the so called oil guard, responsible for destruction of Petroleum facilities in the oil crescent.

1917 2018-12-31 20:01:47 I mean Subarus rule because they just keep their permanent AWD and their boxer motors regardless what the fucking market does because it's simply better just this dedication makes them special. And I mean a minor oil leak is easily fixable every car needs some maintenance.
1918 2018-12-31 20:01:40 I massage my scalp for like 1-2 minutes after diffusing it. Either with jojoba oil or this other one I just got (I’ll have to see what it is when I get a sec). I just chopped my hair off in Sept I think and it’s grown A LOT! Also prenatal vitamins.
1919 2018-12-31 20:01:26 Can I oil up your penguin?  
1920 2018-12-31 20:01:19 Be patient. The oil industry is still subsidized, yet I don't see you railing about that.
1921 2018-12-31 20:01:05 I had a dream about being at a @lights concert and we all starting singing Oil & Water so loudly she cried... I cried too lol and then I woke up and was so SAD it wasn’t real
1922 2018-12-31 20:01:00 Wait until we have electric cars in 10 yrs and there oil will be worthless.  They will go back to the slums they was.
1923 2018-12-31 20:00:54 Want soft lips? Brush your lips when you’re brushing your teeth and put Vaseline or coconut oil for moisture.. thank me later
1924 2018-12-31 20:00:52 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

1932 2018-12-31 20:00:16 We already have ample technology to reduce emissions. Carbon taxes, tax or rationing of flights, and other politico-economic measures are needed to push investment in the right direction faster. And keeping the remaining oil and coal in the ground is key.

1934 2018-12-31 19:59:44 I think I’d rather ingest motor oil
1935 2018-12-31 19:59:42 Praise Yhwh for Creating the Sacred Cannabis plant on Hebrew it was called Kaneh Bosm it is it the Original Holy Anointing Oil.  At the Cannabis Embassy of Yhwh we use Cannabis in ALL forms as our Religious Sacrament. We open with prayer, study scripture,  have fellowship.
1936 2018-12-31 19:59:41 Like vinegar and oil
1937 2018-12-31 19:59:36 Let's remember some of the good things from 2018:
-The Adam Driver oil baron sketch from SNL
-My girlfriend didn't dump me
-I had steamer clams for the first time, yum
-First Reformed was pretty great
-Jacob deGrom
1938 2018-12-31 19:59:29 the lights and gas are whatever. But the oil life actually makes me queasy
1939 2018-12-31 19:59:20 Hey, we never asked you to invade our region, bringing chaos, war, human crisis, #ISIS, #Taliban, #Yemen instability, mass murders and an endless list of evil deeds with it. U're leaving #Syria because it's all rubbles with no #OIL! Otherwise you wouldn't have left, like #Iraq!!!
1940 2018-12-31 19:59:17 Starting to ring in my New Year early with a little snack.
Octopus in olive oil with fresh lemon a seafood  kind of NYE
1941 2018-12-31 19:59:03 Earth is a sealed Eco system, RIGHT?
The core runs on fuel that is filtered down from the surface,
RIGHT?
We keep removing this fuel from inside the Earth, oil & gas,
RIGHT?

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE USE TOO MUCH OF EARTHS FUEL??!!

#GlobalWarming
#global DISASTER!!

RIGHT??!!
1942 2018-12-31 19:58:53 Speak for yourself, I’m gonna wake up as an eccentric billionaire who owns the worlds biggest oil company and plays golf on the weekends
1943 2018-12-31 19:58:25 Not gna lie oil king for me is a fashion icon!!

Looking good bro 
1944 2018-12-31 19:58:24 My mix is h2o, liquid aloe vera & rose hip/lavender essential oil.
1945 2018-12-31 19:58:19 แฮปปี้นิวเยียร์นะ
1946 2018-12-31 19:58:17 Oh yes! Oil up your lens 
1947 2018-12-31 19:58:11 Slowly allowing an external unelected body of elitists to dictate our policies and then seeing them creeping in our laws, motion, bills whatever you want to call them, is not a one act of treason but it surely is treason!
@JustinTrudeau = #Traitor
Oil and feathers on rail track!
1948 2018-12-31 19:58:10 What vitamins do y’all take? I got Women’s One A Day and I’m gonna get Cod Liver Oil pills. Anything else?
1949 2018-12-31 19:58:00 Since when are oil changes $75??? F that noise.
1950 2018-12-31 19:57:40 Well, the auto sector has largely been surviving off of government subsidies. The oil sector is already making millions a day, but is that money going into the economy? Judging from Alberta right now, I'd say no, looks like it's just going into an oil exec's pocket.
1951 2018-12-31 19:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
1952 2018-12-31 19:57:19 My oil change just cost me $70 pray for me this shit cray
1953 2018-12-31 19:57:10 yes, really, you obtuse oil & gas flunky
1954 2018-12-31 19:57:05 And that's okay about the time that they do we'll have our wall we'll keep our tax cuts will have more jobs for the American people than we've ever had before will have produced more oil than any country in the world unless people on welfare
1955 2018-12-31 19:56:45 How often do you change the oil in your car?  I've read that engine oil lasts nearly forever - but changing it frequently is s a "racket" to make money for service shops and oil companies. Obviously, that is a possible #ConspiracyTheory.
1956 2018-12-31 19:56:42 Came to get my oil changed 
1957 2018-12-31 19:56:36 Oh whatever... Why do you think Norway is not a member of the EU? They know damn well that with their oil wealth they would have been put in the same position that Germany was with the Pigs countries. It's not like AB has sent 220 billion more in fed taxes to Ottawa in the 1/2
1958 2018-12-31 19:56:26 How can we have such vast tourism potential and continue to squander it? All the shrines, all our history, museums, nature neglected..  atleast now oil prices have crashed, maybe we’d finally have some development
1959 2018-12-31 19:56:18 I do not begrudge you for having one because I Wish we all could afford one. Maybe tell @JustinTrudeau some help to us instead of billions to oil companies.
1960 2018-12-31 19:56:11 Note to self:
Adding a teaspoon seasoned oil to your heavy whipping cream while making butter in the food processor keeps it from separating.

I am ashamed....
... And I'm starting over.....
1961 2018-12-31 19:55:58 Straight Coconut oil
1962 2018-12-31 19:55:44 That's prolly a good rule of thumb then, when one is "following the $." To ask not just who/what industry $ came from, but if it came from out of state. Still, for folks who think "tech is evil" or "oil is evil" the "it's in-state so it's ok" argument will always be a hard sell.
1963 2018-12-31 19:55:37 今年も色んなところでよろしくです！！！
1964 2018-12-31 19:55:30 Our anniversary plans just got sketchy. Max ate Sesame oil/bottle. Vet said there is going to be . 
1965 2018-12-31 19:55:15 Florida but it just a year old. They built a lot of provisions into the legislation. It has to be grown here, processed here and sold here. It only comes as CBD oil or tincures. Govenor has been fighting legislation that would allow smoking. Not able to grow your own!
1966 2018-12-31 19:55:12 Straight out of old west snake oil salesmen. I fell for it a few years back. Changing career and needed help. The most help is free here with you and others.
1967 2018-12-31 19:55:05 2019 projections: 1. High yield spreads continue to widen, 2. Cyclicals underperform, 3. GDP is sub-2% driven by oil impact, lower capex and waning consumer spending and 4) government deficit accelerates.
1968 2018-12-31 19:55:02 The future is electric, oil is dying on the vine, buy Tesla now.
1969 2018-12-31 19:54:46 何度聞いても落ちサビの手越くんのところでゾワゾワくる。
1970 2018-12-31 19:54:46 A happy new year to you too! Thanks for all you do for we wee indies! More in 2019!!
1971 2018-12-31 19:54:45 Happy New Years to you Jen.
1972 2018-12-31 19:54:44 You're kicking in an open door. I support a severe increase of nuclear power globally. Wind power has some severe problems and limitations, while solar power needs more development and refinement. Oil and coal should get scrapped.
1973 2018-12-31 19:54:35 People aren’t buying the political snake oil anymore it’s stand and be counted time.
1974 2018-12-31 19:54:31 And just how long have those glaciers been melting? Oh! Since the ice age. Wow! That's a long time. Hmm! Way before oil was discovered---right? So much 4 that theory. & just how much has the oceans risen since Gore predicted n 2002 that Lower Manhattan would be submerged by 2014?
1975 2018-12-31 19:54:30 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
1976 2018-12-31 19:54:28 Make up remover wipes are SO bad for your skin. It strips the oils from your face & will dry your face out. Causing breakouts. Coconut oil or almond oil on a cotton ball does wonders for taking your make up off & leaving you a nice glow!!

1980 2018-12-31 19:53:58 What a good oil to put on bleach hair that won’t make your hair look greasy??
1981 2018-12-31 19:53:50 I have a question.  I'm a 6 year listener but do not have access to the form. If Iraq has to redo their budget based on current oil $. Tony said that they would borrow money from other countries to finance their budget.  As T says who does that make sense to.  They don't revalue

1985 2018-12-31 19:52:52 Secret oil, pesky trident.
1986 2018-12-31 19:52:37 Not true!Any economy can thrive so long as it has commodities or expertise to sell. Gold,Oil & many other things make USA wealthy.I agree war DOES make LOTS of $$$,but its not a necessity for prosperity; Defense is a necessity for survival. Peace! :D
1987 2018-12-31 19:52:36 omg@pls god pls how long does an oil change take i am so cold like i am so cold
1988 2018-12-31 19:52:30 Does your shit have this much oil?
1989 2018-12-31 19:52:29 I just had an oil change and just got a state inspection...why is my check engine light on 
1990 2018-12-31 19:52:22 If you have friends who can't afford oil, pellets or wood for winter, and you're broke also, bring odd metal, steel, iron and recyclable bottles to recycling center. Use money earned for: Jerry can of oil, 1/2 price torn pellet bag, or bundle of wood. One day at a time....
1991 2018-12-31 19:52:22 Hi Marvin, The 2018 Forester should get its oil changed every 6 months or 6,000 miles. Thanks!
1992 2018-12-31 19:52:15 Thank you, definitely hoping for a prosperous 2019 :)
1993 2018-12-31 19:52:09 We need to stop pumping more oil and dismantle the petrochemical industry altogether. Our oceans are starting to choke on the waste and pollution.
1994 2018-12-31 19:52:08 今年もダサくない生き方をするのを目標に頑張ろうと思います！！！
1995 2018-12-31 19:51:58 Not sure what snake oil you're trying to sell here, but we certainly don't need some neo-liberal incremental approach that keeps For Profit Healthcare in the drivers seat or some doomed to fail public option!

What we need is HR676 Improved Medicare for All and we need it now.
1996 2018-12-31 19:51:55 bonefish’s bread and oil is literally crack

2004 2018-12-31 19:50:36 I can't believe you call that a lazy slob look. I would call it "Hunky husband getting the groceries and the oil changed" look. 
2005 2018-12-31 19:50:29 Great! Just like many of us have been suggesting for years. Also, they could clean up the huge mess the oil and gas companies have left behind.
2006 2018-12-31 19:50:13 Change my car’s oil finally and complain less and maybe even try to contact my old friends again
2007 2018-12-31 19:50:08 imagine if we had a west-east pipeline (multi-billions to construct) and we were supplying the east with $40. oil sands (most expensive to produce) crude.  maybe Alberta would curtail production, what then.  we import oil so we can export at a much higher return.
2008 2018-12-31 19:50:00 Elizabeth Warren announcing she’s running for president is like when your old friend from HS announces she’s going for “elite green” status at her essential oil MLM.

Theoretically it’s possible, but 6 months from now she’ll be working at a QuikTrip

2009 2018-12-31 19:49:40 They're attacking him cause they know he's a threat. Beware of those who attack. They did the same to HRC. I read something about those "voting record" attacks, how incorrect it was. Same as those who claim he took PAC money from oil comp. Lies! Bernie Bros out to get him w/lies.
2010 2018-12-31 19:49:28 Now just add a few drops of oil.
2011 2018-12-31 19:49:28 Since the last time I called Trump a moron, & him being bombarded by lolbeing called an idiot for withdrawing from Syria, spokesperson Graham says the withdrawal will be a leaky oil pan. Russ & Iran will have to wait until his stupidity kicks in again (short wait)

2014 2018-12-31 19:49:12 Also: I am somewhat less worried about the money thing because so much of that is about the part of the country they are from. For ex TX folks make $ from oil, CA has tech, NJ has pharma/chemicals. That's who has $ to give. If the $$ is from out of state it is more concerning.

2023 2018-12-31 19:47:50 I found a combination of all natural peanut butter, coconut or MCT oil, cream cheese, and a little stevia to be a good substitute. Just don’t go crazy on the amount of peanut butter, and heating it a little makes it easier to mix. Sometimes I add honey, but don’t tell anyone!

#Lougheed warned us to go slow and steady on oil sands expansion but no #Klein and voters said balls to wall. That’s why we have this mess. #Harper    promoted the #usa and only late in the game, tidewater 
2026 2018-12-31 19:47:18 Yes but what about all the local artisanal chili oils made by other godmothers that have their own nuances? I decry the homogenization of chili oil by the Lao-gan-ma-industrial complex.
2027 2018-12-31 19:47:14 While I admit and admire the fact of the Texas history, the Texans in this case are facing a force led by @CaptAndrewLuck with a full supply of squirrel oil and possum tongue. #ColtsForged

2043 2018-12-31 19:45:35 no. You understand what "geographical share" is, right?  It's all the revenues from oil and gas within Scotland's geographical area

2045 2018-12-31 19:45:31 Like making a movie about the Pope that ignores Catholic theology. Cheney was competent bureaucrat who never cared much about public image or getting as wealthy as someonein his position could get. So Adam says Power! and Oil! even though neither has a lot of explanatory force.
2046 2018-12-31 19:45:31 They ended up doing more than an oil change, but this is ridiculous.  I’m closing in on FIVE hours

2066 2018-12-31 19:43:53 Bless @jessieb_tweets and the shave revolution! I’m going into 2019 feeling like a million bucks and a new woman (without any nicks or bumps!) I should of known as an Italian woman that olive oil cures all! 
2067 2018-12-31 19:43:48 I agree. Peanut/sunflower oil blend saturated chicken. Not the business no more
2068 2018-12-31 19:43:44 Did you look up smarminess before writing it? I can’t wait to see a ‘green’ tablet/phone/computer with no oil by-products. Most ‘green’ companies can’t survive without government assistance. I wonder why that is?
2069 2018-12-31 19:43:37 As an oil fan and former politician, that is offensive to politicians! lol
2070 2018-12-31 19:43:36 I don't know if anyone has notice, but oil is going crazy and charts are not work correctly. Massive manipulation !!
2071 2018-12-31 19:43:32 i’m jealous i cant afford oil
2072 2018-12-31 19:43:25 C watching D make some oil and it is the cutest. 
2073 2018-12-31 19:43:22 Oil's well that ends well. Happy New Year Jake!
2074 2018-12-31 19:43:16 Are they covered in oil?
2075 2018-12-31 19:42:54 Another quoting Venezuela with no clue. Sorry. Venezuela has the biggest oil reserves in the world, more than the Saudis. Our neighbor could use better deals, helping them with the oil distilleries, and no sanctions.
2076 2018-12-31 19:42:51 i actually have some bob ross oil paints i use theyre fantastic
2077 2018-12-31 19:42:43 If your dad doesn’t ask you when the last time you’ve had an oil change was everytime you see him, is he even your dad?
2078 2018-12-31 19:42:40 Gerry it was never lower than UK oil revenue by “many billions”-if you’re just going to make stuff up it is embarrassing for you.
You’ve still not shown how we’d get more oil revenue post Indy given we get all our geographical revenue already. And there’s no oil price conspiracy!
2079 2018-12-31 19:42:39 ASAP Viscosity Mixing Rule and Viscosity–Temperature Relationship Estimation for Oil Sand Bitumen… @environmentguru

2083 2018-12-31 19:42:05 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
2084 2018-12-31 19:42:03 I don't know if anyone has notice, but oil is going crazy and charts are not work correctly. Massive manipulation !!
2085 2018-12-31 19:42:01 No bad vibe next year,oil leakers stay far away

2088 2018-12-31 19:41:38 @NPR was touting past 30 years of dietary advice as gospel this am. The lead was coconut oil has too much sat fat then diverted to BS
2089 2018-12-31 19:41:38 Getting ready for 2019 to be the best ever, I just threw away that jar of coconut oil with the missing lid that a fly died in! #goals #lifehacks #coconut #idontknowwhyitswallowedthefly
2090 2018-12-31 19:41:33 I don't know if anyone has notice, but oil is going crazy and charts are not work correctly. Massive manipulation !!
2091 2018-12-31 19:41:30 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
2092 2018-12-31 19:41:19 Hi Liz, which essential oil brand do you use? @LizFulcher
2093 2018-12-31 19:41:13 Been around since the nitro blast and oil paint days
2094 2018-12-31 19:41:12 How much money do they take from Big oil, pharma, and Monsanto? How's their foreign policy? 
Oh, no different from any Republicans? 
Got it. 
No mention of Tulsi Gabbard? She has more integrity in her pinky compared to this list.
2095 2018-12-31 19:41:09 My trailing stop got hit $HOU than oil explodes to the upside. FFS 
2096 2018-12-31 19:41:00 Castor Oil is all this is.... maybe taking it will help people suffering from higher temps, wait- I mean lower temps, wait I mean more storms, wait - I mean fewer storms, wait- disruption! - oh what the heck, just tax us so the world can survive!

2099 2018-12-31 19:40:32 First, look at the data presented.  The data states that the funding is from those who work in the oil/gas industry, NOT the oil/gas industry.  Beto didn't take superPAC money only from individuals.  Considering he's from Texas, most supporters work in oil/gas

2102 2018-12-31 19:40:28 First source of Mexican economy income are U.S. remittances above oil, mining, agriculture, manufacturing & tourism...Mexico can't survive without U.S. remittances. Impose a 35% remittance tax until Mexico stops allowing U.S. invasion from its territory. Hit Mexico where it hurts
2103 2018-12-31 19:40:20 They make a really good spaghetti with mussels and a chilli olive oil sauce there; definitely one of the nicer restaurants in the toon.
2104 2018-12-31 19:40:07 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
2105 2018-12-31 19:39:47 Not on issues that are identified as Trump attacks. They'll go negative on stuff like "why did you take $100,000 from oil execs," etc.
2106 2018-12-31 19:39:29 I’m gonna try braiding my hair again today, if I post pics don’t judge how greasy my hair is lol I’ve been putting a ton of coconut oil and Argan oil in it so that it’s healthy enough to bleach.

Your jar of oil will never go dry . 
"Let's do it again!!!"
2111 2018-12-31 19:38:48 So when it's sunny, do females go and rub oil on their faces and take selfies or it's usually a coincidence?
2112 2018-12-31 19:38:37 "Snake oil salesman" are kinds words for what he really is.
2113 2018-12-31 19:38:34 Finally, apply lip balm or I also find that coconut oil works. 

Reminder: Do not do this often. You are beautiful the way you are.

2118 2018-12-31 19:37:59 All good people. You just listed the few people in politics who are actually working FOR the people and NOT the corporations/Wall St/Big Oil/the elite.  How do you sleep at night?
2119 2018-12-31 19:37:55 I dropped hot oil on me yesterday at work by accident and today I smashed my thumb ): I can never get a break

2121 2018-12-31 19:37:39 The wheel and an idiot wall isn’t the same. People used to use hot oil over a wall but that isn’t done anymore either. Technology is better and less expensive.
2122 2018-12-31 19:37:32 I don’t trust anyone that uses beard oil

2125 2018-12-31 19:37:19 Pahugasa lang ko'g plato, baso, kutsara ug tinidor ayaw lang gyud ng kalaha nga grabe ug oil with pagod nga mga lamas
2126 2018-12-31 19:37:03 It seems that you both are right. Beto refused money from oil companies. 
But among his many contributors, there were quite a few who work in that industry.  Even some top-level execs.
Of course, Oil is a huge local employer in Texas. As the defense industry is in the PNW.
2127 2018-12-31 19:37:02 What do we call a PM that gives away CDN sovereignty to an unelected corrupt global organization & does everything in his power to landlock AB oil? What's the politically correct word of the day?
2128 2018-12-31 19:36:54 Too many puppies are being shot in the dark. 
Too many puppies are trained not to bark. 
At the sight of blood that must be spilled                                                   So that we may maintain our oil fields.

2131 2018-12-31 19:36:42 Question.2003 Schumer hosted Putin at the opening of Lukoil, to arrange Russia’s oil empire to open in NY this had to take a great deal of Government maneuvering , Senior Senator CS, who served alongside then-Sen-HRC, what deals were made with Putin to have Lukoil come to NY ?

a tablespoon of olive oil and apply. 

Let it sit for 2-3 minutes until nearly
dry and add a layer of ONLY cinnamon.

After adding the layer of the cinnamon, wait another 2-3 minutes and take off with a wet paper towel.

2138 2018-12-31 19:35:33 Girl I was on my way to go get my oil change 
2139 2018-12-31 19:35:31 Realistically, with the liberal gov't doing everything they can shut down the oil sands, those Equalization payments are going to be drastically reduced cuz of the billions of dollars in lost revenue. They can't give out what they don't get in their coffers.

4. Rolex Wristwatch
5. Lovely Perfume Oil

I hope I get any or all of these
2143 2018-12-31 19:35:13 The logic that Oil needs to improve the D is unassailable. Trying to do that with spare parts not even playing on their former teams, and with horrid numbers when they did play, is very assailable. And, of course, over-paying, because Chiarelli.
2144 2018-12-31 19:35:08 สวัสดีปีใหม่จ้าาาา 
2145 2018-12-31 19:35:05 Oil filled radiator thank goodness though!
2146 2018-12-31 19:35:04 As if Russia hoax and the global warming hoax are not fear-based. He can run on not starting any new Wars, pulling us out of one, unemployment, GDP us oil exporter again, gas prices, routing Isis, NK peace talks... why what are Democrats going to run on? Caravans and socialism?
2147 2018-12-31 19:35:02 The purpose of the carbon levy is two-fold: One, to fight climate change, and two, to return money to Canadian tax-payers that was taken by large oil corporations.

2151 2018-12-31 19:34:16 oh i see now of course a german would want to focus on US crimes after what your country has tried to do for centuries lol you still want our norwegian oil?
2152 2018-12-31 19:34:15 Ha I am glad I am not the only one taking an ‘ oil city constitutional’  for New Year. Happy New Year , by the way!
2153 2018-12-31 19:34:12 Elway and Jim Harbaugh would be oil and water. He isn’t leaving Michigan. Quite frankly, he hasn’t done anything to really merit an opportunity. Too many underlying issues that make him a poor candidate for the job.

2157 2018-12-31 19:34:00 Pipelines for travel, not oil mind you. 
2158 2018-12-31 19:33:56 There’s oil and I have a match box I could simply use
2159 2018-12-31 19:33:52 He should call it the "Snake Oil" Special on Junk Science.
2160 2018-12-31 19:33:51 Agreed. I don't need my house to burn down first before I know I need to change the batteries in the smoke detector.  I don't need my car to blow up before I know to change the oil.  There are zero positives to Trump.

2170 2018-12-31 19:32:43 When I needed some time to catch a breather or just to slow down some, I would claim a moving truck or oil delivery truck had me blocked in
2171 2018-12-31 19:32:40 It's saving me, however, Kratom, if taken too often, will become addicting too. I know what I'm talking about. Next for me is smoking Cannabis Oil. Starting tomorrow.
2172 2018-12-31 19:32:30 It’s an acquired taste I’ll admit, the heating oil gives it a wonderful sheen though!
2173 2018-12-31 19:32:29 Well until last year Scotland's Geographic share has been consistently lower than UK Rev by many £bn's but that would be eliminated on Independence  Right?  Interesting also when you notice the marked decline in Oil rev around 2014 that alone cannot be attributed to lower price.
2174 2018-12-31 19:32:24 I like to do some riced cauliflower, onions, garlic, fresh jalapeño sautéed in coconut or avocado oil. Toss in some chicken and have avo on the side.
2175 2018-12-31 19:32:07 I mean it’s probably worth a lot because of all the coal & oil!! So not a super bad plan but also why don’t we try selling Alaska first since they’re already connected to another country lol
2176 2018-12-31 19:32:05 I miss being covered in grease and engine oil.

2190 2018-12-31 19:30:18 More than a fun fact. Since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the U.S. #EnergyEfficiency gains averaged 1.9%/yr. In that period we exceeded 3% in 7 different years. Had we averaged 3% over the entire 27 years? We would have saved ~60 bln barrels oil equivalent. Better for the Climate!

2199 2018-12-31 19:28:54 Just read the history of Anglo-Persian oil Co. influence on Iran politics and BP on gulf states in the mid 20 century. While London has prospered from those deals Tehran, Riyad are left out in the dust. HshM’ Som-Oil wants for Somalia the same.
2200 2018-12-31 19:28:51 Nice, love Neck Oil! Have a good evening and a Happy New Year
2201 2018-12-31 19:28:40 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 4 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

2202 2018-12-31 19:28:38 I guess I had better oil the chain on my bicycle as it appears as if the barmaid has designs on outlawing the internal combustion engine.
2203 2018-12-31 19:28:33 Uhh ... have you checked the price of a barrel of oil? Might have a lot more to do with the price @ the pump than your scripted claim.
2204 2018-12-31 19:28:22 Wild growth oil makes my scalp so itchy. I hate it.
2205 2018-12-31 19:28:03 Google writes and maintains the algorithms needed to block citizens in communist countries Fromm accessing the full internet. I bet you still use them. Most countries buy their oil. So...yeah what your point? Other then to be an  XRP hater?
2206 2018-12-31 19:27:58 I see people pointing out that oil is at a very low price at the moment; but also, if they took the picture in the morning instead of the evening the price would be substantially higher, as gas retailers have been playing with the prices by time of day in the last few months.
2207 2018-12-31 19:27:42 @SiobhanMFallon If you come across any billionaire oil tycoons in Abu Dhabi who want to produce a sword and sorcery urban fantasy TV series (as a tax write off, of course), please let me know. :-)
2208 2018-12-31 19:27:37 I bought oil without calling my dad, this is an achievement
2209 2018-12-31 19:27:33 the matter and still nobody is better than and you can only say this as Annie and Hano were eating cracked lobster bisque dipped in dim sum buns hand toasted in sesame oil droplets and yet nobody is better than the person who feeds 40 hungry children and yet 40 hungry children
2210 2018-12-31 19:27:33 The other thing to remind Mitch is, if people from other provinces didn’t go to work in the oil fields there would be no oil & gas sector as there aren’t enough skilled workers actually from AB to fill all the jobs so there is that fact to consider.

2212 2018-12-31 19:26:44 There are more people in the world. There are more people getting out of poverty due to access to oil. If you don't want that, you should do something to stop progress.

But you won't because you're comfortable. Most wouldn't survive without modern luxury of oil.
2213 2018-12-31 19:26:35 I don't have any leads but, can you find out what Putin got in exchange for not helping Venezuela? Some free oil for Syria?
2214 2018-12-31 19:26:28 Plus I personally think that trash in the oceans and oil leakages from pipelines is a far worse problem as is excessive metal sulphates in mine drainage systems @aaronhuertas

2216 2018-12-31 19:26:11 CBD oil might help
2217 2018-12-31 19:26:06 This is amazing!!! May I ask how long did it take to finish this piece? Did you use oil?
2218 2018-12-31 19:25:51 Dab box by Vivant vaporizer for use for dab/oil/wax etc..
2219 2018-12-31 19:25:50 But her ass didn’t even put no oil or lotion on. Uploading pics and her damn ankles ashy as fuck 
2220 2018-12-31 19:25:48 Seems to be. No oil, no stocks.
2221 2018-12-31 19:25:44 This just makes me think of when I bring up the books I’m reading... did you know the Koch brothers’ dad made a lot of money making oil refineries for Russia and the Nazis before WWII??

2225 2018-12-31 19:25:23 Hard to join a party that is at times very difficult to distinguish between them and the war hawk, oil lobby bought, anti-equality, anti-labor, anti-Med4All, Republicans.

You can stick to your "team Dem" and I'll stick with team Progressive Values.
2226 2018-12-31 19:25:12 Criticizing policy and pointing out donations is not attacking.

There was no coordinated attack on Beto. It began with a tepid tweet on his oil donors & his horrible voting record where he stands with the GOP on many votes.

Stop being divisive & uncritical of establishment.

2230 2018-12-31 19:24:15 “Apply 1-2 drops to eyes,” the Visine instructions say, cavalier. As though this were a natural thing to do. I’m gonna end up blind, eye drops running down my face, trying to enter my ears like the Black Oil
2231 2018-12-31 19:23:58 Its not a bread type I'm keen on to be honest 

Paraffin stove or heating oil?

2234 2018-12-31 19:23:25 Yeah, oil hadn't been applied yet. And no, that's my glass. I shall fight to the death over my gin glass (maybe…)
2235 2018-12-31 19:23:19 “Coconut oil enthusiasts say it is the next great health food. But it contains high levels of saturated fat, which is associated with an increased risk of heart disease.” Relative to other macronutrients*

2238 2018-12-31 19:22:52 100 million a day is lost in oil thanks to BC  and QUE and 23 million on gas - yet we have the most regulated energy sector in the world???? Gullible Canadians have been fooled into believing a contributor of 1.5% of the world’s GHG problem can make a difference...
2239 2018-12-31 19:22:46 No bullshit though. She do be on the cbd oil shit lls she keep asking me have i tried it.
2240 2018-12-31 19:22:36 Everyone complains that NYC must be so expensive and stressful, why would I live there, but not once in my 3 years there have gotten a ticket, bought gas, changed my oil, renewed tags, or even thought about car insurance. All of which I’ve done within a week of being in Ohio.
2241 2018-12-31 19:22:28 I came at nine to get my oil and antifreeze change but the mechanic is taking his sweet time. I have to be on work on half an hour and I still got shit to do.
2242 2018-12-31 19:22:26 Hmmm it didn't seem right to call it that because I had no oil or lemon but if you say so its pesto!
2243 2018-12-31 19:22:22 there was no carbon tax, there was cap and trade, which is a totally different thing. And gasoline is still more than it was a few years ago when oil was going for double its current price. #folks #bullshit
2244 2018-12-31 19:22:15 Hopes for humanity in 2019...
1.)  Ridding the world of these artificial borders which has no relevance in an age of globalization & a march toward a Type 1 civilization.
2.)  Focus on more future oriented industries esp clean energy & definitely not oil, coal, pipelines, etc.
2245 2018-12-31 19:22:11 I had one break in my mouth while riding a four wheeler in the desert (long story) and it just felt like vegetable oil. No irritation whatsoever.

2251 2018-12-31 19:21:40 Now can we not make medical #cbdoil with Palm Oil, it’s made me so ill..
2252 2018-12-31 19:21:35 No worries.I respect your choices. I feel so good these days since i started medicating with the cannibas oil / using the shake to add to baked goods.If the THC part of it bothers you using CBD oil,bud or isolate,cbdhoney will still halp w/anxiety,depression,inflamation,insomnia.

2255 2018-12-31 19:21:29 Interesting.  Thanks for the reply.  I routinely do 17:7, probably 5-6 times per week.  I don't need to lose much more weight, so sometimes have 1 tbsp heavy cream or MCT oil in my morning coffee, but usually black.  I am pretty intimidated by the thought of 24 hours.
2256 2018-12-31 19:21:27 I can send you the recipes some time if you like, but they require a lot of coconut oil (which you can reuse if you don't burn it) which can be a little pricey for a cooking experiment. Then that plus the time and cleanup... I'm really happy I tried it though. Learning is fun!
2257 2018-12-31 19:21:11 He took 2700 from the top people in the oil and gas companies.. that’s called a BRIBE.. don’t tell me to read.. have you checked his voting record?? You need to keep up honey..
2258 2018-12-31 19:21:11 With more micro involvement like this at the local level, there would be less need for macro solutions, "politics" at the federal level. 
Doesnt "take a village," on the federal level to solve problems if the village itself takes responsibility closer to home
2259 2018-12-31 19:21:00 If it doesn't change federally I think a lot of people will be surprised how far Albertans are willing to go! Our politicians can get on board with saving our oil industry or find a new career!
2260 2018-12-31 19:20:59 Make us afford these things.
Make us afford our own choice of:
-cooking oil
-baking flour
-type of rice.
2261 2018-12-31 19:20:43 Stop embarrassing yourself by lying to "the people".  Your gov't has nothing to do with oil prices. You have lost any credibility you had by becoming a Doug Ford bootlicker along with @celliottability . Your careers will be remembered this way, as Doug's obedient pets.
2262 2018-12-31 19:20:42 Doc don't mind them, when the time comes, no one will tell them, I know how I economize my consumption in Kano 
2263 2018-12-31 19:20:23 I can't help feeling that Seaborne Freight has been so named as a backhand nod to the @SamSeaborn story arc where he creates a liability shield for an oil tanker purchase, so that if litigation ever penetrates there are no real assets, just debt.

2264 2018-12-31 19:20:22 え。怖い
2265 2018-12-31 19:20:15 This is some of the worst reporting I’ve seen come out of @NPR, and has the potential to cause harmful dietary choices.  To say seed oils like Canola—known to lead to obesity—are preferable to short and medium chain fatty acids in coconut oil is 
2266 2018-12-31 19:20:14 That's my point entirely, the UK got involved because the elite, who run the country saw a chance to cash in, told us it was about human rights which then ,because of the tactics they employed, became a religious war, then they stole the oil and bailed out, leaving them to it.
2267 2018-12-31 19:19:54 Loccitane immortelle overnight reset oil in serum ค่ะ ดีเกินคาดจริงๆ
2268 2018-12-31 19:19:54 Sana oil may natatangap na pera
2269 2018-12-31 19:19:40 I'm tired of Canada is only pipelines. It is only one of the resources in this country. Did you forget what Harper did to oil in canada. Hope the oil workers dont forget.
2270 2018-12-31 19:19:40 Something we must understand. It isnt "Alberta " oil, it is Canadian oil. A strong Alberta helps the Canadian economy. Why Canadians from coast to coast would not want a strong, vibrant economy is beyond me.

2276 2018-12-31 19:18:49 Leaving the planet “better” is my hope, using what it provided by this universe is how I plan to do that. Sun, captured electricity, oil and most things man made. Innovation is what will drive this hope.  #weyoung
2277 2018-12-31 19:18:48 Yep. I’ve donated that oil and gas $$ because (checks notes) I live in Texas and my husband spent the last decade doing IT for oil and gas. Scandal!

Fun fact: Bernie Sanders got that oil and gas cash fr us back in ‘16. Hindsight is 20/20, I know, but who got oil $$ now?!
2278 2018-12-31 19:18:33 I ordered some CBD oil for my anxiety and insomnia and it gets here today and I’m so so so excited to try it.
2279 2018-12-31 19:18:33 そろそろですかね………
2280 2018-12-31 19:18:23 Please is it just me or Nigerians do not give people bags of beans as gifts, has to always be bags of rice and vegetable oil?
2281 2018-12-31 19:18:15 My girl put me on it and then I realized that most “beard” oils are a mix of that and like coconut and almond oil or some shit. Been using just the regular argan oil ever since
2282 2018-12-31 19:18:02 Let’s go Canucks.  Listening to @BatchHockey and @CoreyHirsch call the game from an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Thailand.
2283 2018-12-31 19:17:54 Which one is the hot oil treatment? Is it the one on the stick?

It helps with a lot of things it even heals cuts faster and if u put it on ur hair it makes it more shiny smoother and stronger it even works getting off makeup if ur in a hurry which I doubt u would wear often but it does wonders @GraysonDolan

2290 2018-12-31 19:17:10 I think snake oil would go better with s word salads.
2291 2018-12-31 19:17:08 Cast iron skillet (I prefer ridged). Preheat at medium on the stove top but for a good long time (like 10 mins). Brush steak with balsamic vinegar and then grape-seed or avocado oil, followed by rosemary salt. More of same oil in pan. Flip often, to 130-140º. Rest 5-10 mins.
2292 2018-12-31 19:17:07 No halfsees, close it ALL, both ways nothing gets threw, no cars fruits, vegtable, oil, gas, boats, workers EVERYTHING. That will punish Mx for not paying for the trump wall/barrier/metaphor/concrete monstrosity..

2294 2018-12-31 19:16:59 I haven’t been out on a date in so long that if I ever date again, I’m probably just going to stand there with a confused look on my face, a bottle of baby oil in one hand, and an inflatable penguin in the other.

2300 2018-12-31 19:16:07 love coconut oil

i once ventured into vegan chile with soy chunks - it was soooo good
2301 2018-12-31 19:15:58 You talking bout the forever oil place?
2302 2018-12-31 19:15:58 Also there are literally more subsidies given to fossil fuel companies than to green energy, and studies have shown that if the market were left to itself green energy could be MORE financially feesable than oil; but due to corruption and fear of change the status quo is kept.
2303 2018-12-31 19:15:42 Nah... New gas&oil pipelines from Iraq Iran through Turkey to Europe. Then cut a tarriff deal with Saudi and UAE. If they got over Israel they would go through Jordan Israel and pipelines to Europe
2304 2018-12-31 19:15:42 “Tar sands” you just lost all credibility. If you think the poisoning of the Earth is Canada’s fault and not the fault of China, India, U.S, etc. you’re sadly mistaken. Look at how oil is produced in Saudi Arabia and tell me tailings ponds are actually an issue.
2305 2018-12-31 19:15:32 Have to take all my pics now, before the annointing oil and tears 
2306 2018-12-31 19:15:28 Gettin an oil change and the wait is 3 hours!! Someone come get me!!!

2309 2018-12-31 19:14:59 -Which could've just came from the already existing power grid network that basically every single country has for more than half the cost, and which is less dangerous in a crash, and which doesn't support & keep those oil tycoons on top, that's the only reason it exists now.
2310 2018-12-31 19:14:58 I need to get a oil change 
2311 2018-12-31 19:14:53 Romaine halves are actually great on the grill-little olive oil brushed on the side facing down and grill over hi heat for no more than a minute, take off and sprinkle Parmesan cheese on it. Incredibly good - but the industry has ruined it because of what happens in the fields 
2312 2018-12-31 19:14:49 Argan oil
2313 2018-12-31 19:14:45 Just dropped and smashed a full bottle of sesame oil and now smell like a delicious stir fry
2314 2018-12-31 19:14:32 All about U.S. aggression and lust for oil.  Shame on us.

When the CIA was forced to stop recruiting, training, arming and funding 
Al Qeda and ISIS (same thing) Assad and Putin were able to eradicate most of them.  The U.S. had nothing to do with that.
2315 2018-12-31 19:14:26 If anyone was wondering I will be spending my NYE in my bed curled up with my dog, my peppermint oil going in my diffuser, tissues beside me, cold medicine pumped into me & binging vloggers on YouTube
2316 2018-12-31 19:14:08 I dusted, vacuumed, and mopped the downstairs. I'd like to pay tribute to the invaluable assistance of Murphy's Oil Soap and Carole King's Tapestry album.
2317 2018-12-31 19:14:07 Might wash & oil my scalp today
2318 2018-12-31 19:14:04 You think they got fleets at the monastery? they're playing in mud using olive oil as lube :/
2319 2018-12-31 19:13:48 If you have a Mutual Fund of any kind it is possible that you are invested in some of the oil industry. It is a commodity that is available. I have solar panels and drive an electric car but I’m sure my IRA has Exxon in it. Do those listed support green energy? More important.

2322 2018-12-31 19:13:33 Historically, oil crashes are pretty negative for EM / China, I believe because of the higher real rates -- from inflation declines and from dis-saving by oil exporters.
2323 2018-12-31 19:13:31 Sana oil
2324 2018-12-31 19:13:17 If it’s not a huge steak, fire up a cast iron skillet to just above medium with a tiny amount of high temp oil (not olive).  Sear one side for about 8min+, then flip and do the other side for 5. Last 2 minutes add herbs, butter.  Don’t move the steak, tip the pan and spoon over.
2325 2018-12-31 19:13:14 ooooooooo, YUK! Try peppermint oil spray around the futon & in the kitchen. Also, the plug in ultrasonic emitters work for vermin & creepy-crawlies.  (shivers)(yeech)
2326 2018-12-31 19:12:57 You must be aware that even with oil at US$150/brl Alex and Nicola could not make the sums add up for IndyRef1. Scots I know and I visit often as my roots are Scottish, Bankhead Farm, Carnwath 1800s I know no one who wants IndyRef2  It's like hmm: barking up the wrong tree
2327 2018-12-31 19:12:44 You have taken over $3 million from the oil and gas industry in your career.

Please get out of your bubble, Senator. Talk to climate scientists, talk to biologists, talk to geologists, talk to anyone NOT involved in the oil and gas industry. Before it's too late.

2329 2018-12-31 19:12:24 Mr. Sanders if you attack USA oil companies with carbon taxes they will move their refineries to China & else where, remember Obama lifted the USA oil export tariff & that is all they been waiting for, can you image the cost of imported gas, $5 a gal
2330 2018-12-31 19:12:16 What a selfish writeup, PMB has done so much for the North an d  still doing it, Oil Exploration have started in Taraba and Bauchi state, a refinery will be build in Katsina where Niger Republic Oil will be refine, Kashimbila Dam is Under construction still in d North.
2331 2018-12-31 19:12:15 I need to get more Polaroid film. I also need crazy glue and oil for my car. But I'm definitely not driving anywhere tonight soooooo I'm conflicted cuz I dont want to get ready for anything for another 5 hours lmao

2333 2018-12-31 19:11:37 After retiring from the military for the second time, at 50 he became a police officer. (He still had 15 years to work)He is federal police officer that patrols a military base. What is it that you do again? Labor work in an oil field??  Still waiting to hear about your service.
2334 2018-12-31 19:11:35 On July 25, 2018, (NOAA) and the Dept. of the Interior proposed revisions to significantly WEAKEN enforcement of the ESA. These proposals would END enforcement reducing protections for certain species, AND potentially opening up critical habitats to oil drilling. #TrumpDidThis

2338 2018-12-31 19:11:13 CAD very low, resource prices low incl. $11 BRL oil, $1.6 billion bailout tabled for oil industry, most trade deals in the toilet, ugly year for stocks, major housing markets depressed. Yeah, Trudeau busy doing the rainbow dance and apologizing for 101 Canadian sins. Sounds great

2350 2018-12-31 19:09:53 To green my heating system, I will need to replace the oil boiler for my forced hot water system with electric.  I was hoping to go to CHP with propane but there are no vendors ready to play ball.
2351 2018-12-31 19:09:53 Oil going from $70 to $45 shortly after CNY oil contract began physically settling is "crazy stimulus" for one side of the US/China dynamic.
2352 2018-12-31 19:09:49 These traits are in our barcoding with Mr. M and me.

It’s why I am an intermediate-level automotive mechanic and change my own oil, belts, plugs and fuses on a 15-year-old truck. And why he’s bought a new car every 3 years and paid dealership service. (I ROARED at that. HOWLED.)

2355 2018-12-31 19:09:38 Infrastructure decayed/dangerous
Health care dismantled 
Taxes.huge gifts to the rich, an extra $1.50 a week to the middle class
swamp-refilled with alligators,pythons, and scum
Children legally seeking asylum killed in US custody
Environment destroyed while oil people get rich
2356 2018-12-31 19:09:27 What’s your point?Many companies from Walmart to McDonald’s to the entire auto sector are foreign owned.CDN’s own the oil and benefit from taxes and royalties, once we get oil to tide water our economy will benefit to the tune of $80 million a day. Say that about any other sector
2357 2018-12-31 19:09:25 Well....

Whatever is happening now days,, has nothing to do with common sense or knowing economic " theory" ... It's all off the chart and heading a place we never been in the oil/gas history....

2359 2018-12-31 19:09:07 It may never will. The interesting thing is that they are always discovering new enormous oil fields...

2362 2018-12-31 19:09:01 “WHY ARE HUMAN LIKE THAT, WE ALL WANT WHAT WE DONT GOT” this lady sitting beside me as we’re waiting to get our oil changed...okay I c u...
2363 2018-12-31 19:08:47 I came in for an oil change and now there's someone drilling my car from the underside. Unsure what's happening but I'm 99% sure they're gonna make me pay for it
2364 2018-12-31 19:08:26 This is our third New Years as a couple and the past two years Cas has spilt oil on me and it’s really hard to craft an outfit that’s cute but is also clothes I don’t care about
2365 2018-12-31 19:08:17 First oil change = first flat tire  what a fucking show it has been!
2366 2018-12-31 19:08:07 I know a good number of blockchain boosters. Fortunately, most of the ones I know personally are sincere, decent evangelists for it. But there’s a lot of snake oil out there still...

2369 2018-12-31 19:07:42 True! We also get soy sauce, rooster sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar. These are generally less than half the grocery store price.
2370 2018-12-31 19:07:39 Today's mood is lemon oil in the diffuser and a pine scented candle burning.

2372 2018-12-31 19:07:23 Its little higher about $1200...but I took lowest number. Main driving factor is Oil, if oil is low production cost falls.
2373 2018-12-31 19:07:11 I’ve never tried this one. Do they have a matte version? Bc my skin secretes so much oil when I out on makeup.

2376 2018-12-31 19:07:02 This was my first handgun. They must be carefully wiped down after cleaning. Slightly too much oil is a bad thing. The mainspring is strong, but any increase in resistance as the slide reciprocates will result in some failures. Otherwise, it is good. Very accurate.

2388 2018-12-31 19:05:25 While you’re at it: use less depleted uranium, elect less warmongers, depend less on oil, care less about fame and distraction, be less cruel, buy less electronics with planned obsolescence built in, OR: quit fucking around and actually change human life fundamentally.

2390 2018-12-31 19:05:13 Pollution isn’t free?  How much is Montreal having to pay for polluting the river?  I guess they have a surplus due to Alberta’s dirty oil equalization payments!
2391 2018-12-31 19:05:01 Hard to not think the energy market is being SUPER manipulated by short side investors. The price action on oil (WTI and WCS) and natural gas (HH and aeco) has been insane.
Tempted to look at UGAZ. There's no reason for natgas to be trading back down to these levels.
2392 2018-12-31 19:05:01 Big oil
2393 2018-12-31 19:04:58 But... what was the oil for then?
2394 2018-12-31 19:04:56 If there’s one thing I hate about Merced is all the weak ass gangbangers. Like chill get an oil change and fix up your car instead of hauling booty all over town.
2395 2018-12-31 19:04:43 Yes,  a 60 year old already functioning pipeline.  Right around the age where maintenance costs skyrocket.  We have not built 1 inch of new pipe.  So yes he bought a pipeline,  but it is of no use as it’s not increasing the movement of oil.
2396 2018-12-31 19:04:36 We've talked abt Fayose severally abt dis very issue but U no wat, let dat b reserved & let's talk abt dis very fresh issues in other to safe lives,

2398 2018-12-31 19:04:30 You act like these moves were something other than to stabilize blueline until healthy, small but critical upgrades if Oil have any chance of hanging in until healthy. Pretending that do nothing or plucking Parayko or Muzzin type off shelf were viable options just isn't thinking
2399 2018-12-31 19:04:24 This whole “Trudeau is a traitor globalist” narrative is absurd and also self contradictory when it comes from people outraged at Alberta’s oil not getting to global markets. We need to restrict flow of people in but increase flow of oil out, riiiiight
2400 2018-12-31 19:04:20 CannaButter Fudge. Multiple flavours. Strong Cannabis flavour. Effects  untested. Limited quantites available for extracting Oil into Coconut  Oil, for instance. Then bake with it. Yum!

2402 2018-12-31 19:03:38 Bayer-Monsanto is happy about this.  Heck Trump even appointed a former Monsanto exec to a high position in the Interior Dept.  Yay big Ag!  Big oil, big Ag, and basically anything that kills the environment and people are loving Trump.
2403 2018-12-31 19:03:37 Cool. Thanks for the information. With all the stuff about EE, I thought QC was also getting imported oil. :)
2404 2018-12-31 19:03:32 Send her to the Bush she can live in a tent made out of leaves and grass. And take away her phone and car and any objects she owns that are made by oil, coal, plastic etc.
2405 2018-12-31 19:03:30 We started pretending the thoughts and opinions of stupid people had merit.
2406 2018-12-31 19:03:26 Everyone should be doing cbd or THC oil instead of smoking for whatever reason they are using
2407 2018-12-31 19:03:25 nods, $LTC halving should help stabilize crypto & lead to some nice capital gains. Very int in stocks like $GE, $AN & even oil patch names like $SLCA for bounces into spring....buy when it snows & sell when it goes....

2412 2018-12-31 19:03:04 Sabotaging Oil industry in Canada. Canada's most valuable resource. Selling out Canada's sovereigny on Immigration to the globalist UN. Selling our sovereignty to large corporations on the #TPP so companies rights supercede our laws. #TrudeauForTreason

2415 2018-12-31 19:02:51 so I bought this very large thing of dish soap from Costco but it's too large to be on the sink so I put it down by the pantry doors

Right now it’s down with a hole in the valve cover and multiple engine sensors that have oil leaking through them.

2436 2018-12-31 19:00:21 "The east" does not import oil, NB's Irving (a profit-seeking corporation) does. Ontario's refineries run on western oil via the Line 9B reversal and QC's refineries accept no Saudi oil. They get about 80%+ Canadian and US-sourced.

2455 2018-12-31 18:59:05 Just got home from having some work done on my truck which was pricey but needed to be done. So now all new front wheel bearings, brakes and an oil change. All worth it to keep it running smoothly. Once I get settled I'll be streaming some games.
2456 2018-12-31 18:58:59 Can you get oil to move up now lol
2457 2018-12-31 18:58:53 Just looking at the area they are proposing. If they are thinking about connectivity between parks and buffers for populations (which is great) that whole area at the south end is nothing but logging and cut blocks (plus oil and gas). Would be great if they toned it down a little
2458 2018-12-31 18:58:03 Why's he look like an oil baron?
2459 2018-12-31 18:57:59 จอยใส่ชุดอะไรวันนี้ เกาหลีร้อนมากเหรอออ โอ้ยอุกอั่ง

2461 2018-12-31 18:57:49 I refused to take medication for years. Then one day my therapist suggested I try medication. She said there was no need for me to be struggling this much. I tried so many different medications! 2 months ago I started taking CBD oil, and it’s been a game changer.
2462 2018-12-31 18:57:43 @MercedesAMGF1 where can I get some @Petronas 5w30 oil?? 
2463 2018-12-31 18:57:39 Guiness there's a reason it looks like used engine oil...
2464 2018-12-31 18:57:38 Fuckin shit man i actually screamed lmaaaao i was trying to slap it on my face cause i was in a rush and well..the oil slapped right onto my eyeball
2465 2018-12-31 18:57:38 So you in the east would rather import your dirty oil from Saudi Arabia than your own backyard?
2466 2018-12-31 18:57:36 Wankers! Molly relaxing with classical music full blast, wearing a thunder shirt, and lavender oil rubbed on her paw pads & neck area.... hoping it'll do the trick
2467 2018-12-31 18:57:35 Thanks for the response. I have read the policy and it's a step in the right direction. It does suggest some of it isn't traceable in origin tho?  - "whenever possible, we source RSPO certified palm oil that is physically traceable"
2468 2018-12-31 18:57:24 2018 highlights...
1. attended the Unrig Summit in NOLA. 

2. Worked really hard to stop an oil pipeline. Certificate on Need is now being appealed.

3. Every single  protest.
2469 2018-12-31 18:57:22 Sounds about right. The world needs to reduce its use of oil, but not for the reasons currently being promoted. Climate Change, which is not a synonym for Global Warming, is a naturally occurring process.

2472 2018-12-31 18:56:57 The last day of a new dawn, get the oil off use dawn, no contact with that company who's dawn, chess no checkers don't loose ya pawn.
2473 2018-12-31 18:56:40 Cottages with oil heating?! So retro Michelle. Cottages in Muskoka usually better than most peoples homes.
2474 2018-12-31 18:56:16 What do you like to draw/sketch/create with** charcoal, oil paint, acrylic, etc
2475 2018-12-31 18:56:10 Is that why canada buys oil from Saudi and brings it to canada in diesel polluting vessels.Canada can produce and use canadian oil .This is just another liberal tax grab.
2476 2018-12-31 18:56:00 See  -  that is just it...I paid attention...when I got my degree it was all about the coming "global freeze" that would see us dead by 2020 - and "peak oil" that was supposed to come in the 90s...it was all fiction - and idiots like you drive the current fiction...
2477 2018-12-31 18:55:54 Must be the "snake oil".
2478 2018-12-31 18:55:53 dianegambino by reputation was severely allergic to sesame seeds then in case sesame oil was added to her list of allergies. yesterday added  in w/ my order from freshdirect but left off the invoice was a bottle of Black Sesame Seeds
2479 2018-12-31 18:55:40 Palm oil is really unhealthy. So is coconut oil. High in the wrong kind of fat. Fact checked .
2480 2018-12-31 18:55:35 Then stay away from diet containing too much fat and oil not to increase sebum production on ur face and rest well. If u have apple cider vinegar at home, use cotton wool to apply the dilluted one on ur face,it works well for acne, pimples and blackheads.
2481 2018-12-31 18:55:30 wheres the oil
2482 2018-12-31 18:55:19 Bit of salt, good oil and dark chocolate
2483 2018-12-31 18:55:12 I've cut out my salt sugar and oil and I've lost 70 pounds in 4 months
2484 2018-12-31 18:54:57 Might be late @neuer just cleaned my fucking eye with my oil cleanser
2485 2018-12-31 18:54:52 It’s back to war on fossil fuels c02 emission narrative destroying the environment. We would shut down the coal and oil industry stop our exports and back to tanking the economy derailing the manufacturing boom shutting down infrastructure. [they] want us dead economically.
2486 2018-12-31 18:54:52 @NancyPelosi & @SenSchumer

There is NO time for an oil & gas funded water-down climate committee.  You have had since the 1970s to fix this. Stop procrastination because you receive Gas &Oil $$.  Greed over People will kill our planet & ourselves.

#GreenNewDealNow 

Just Do It
2487 2018-12-31 18:54:44 ISIS was created and funded by Obama, Hillery, Panetta, and McCain to get Arabian Oil Pipelines across Syria after getting rid of Assad.  That put America in conflict with Russia!  They should all be indicted for TREASON!
2488 2018-12-31 18:54:39 Yep #HappyNew year to you and yours Richard all the best for 2019
And here is to an #indiehour conference in #2019 
2489 2018-12-31 18:54:29 I use CBD oil without THC. It helps.
2490 2018-12-31 18:54:27 If it does, we remain in playoff run. If he did nothing, Oil would not remain in playoff run.  Case closed.
2491 2018-12-31 18:54:27 The idea that doing tangentially related work automatically makes you an expert is a fallacy that people within the NFL continue to indulge at their own peril. Agents didn’t just pop out of nowhere and despite the “narrative” they are not selling snake oil.
2492 2018-12-31 18:54:19 Having helped to royally fuck up their country for oil, I think it’s only fair that we should allow any Iranians who wish to come here to do so, without treating their arrival like some kind of plague. Damn this government to Hell. I despair.
2493 2018-12-31 18:54:18 Since when did Philip become a Texas oil tycoon? Haha
2494 2018-12-31 18:54:09 Five Guys is so good. Those peanut oil fries are nuts!
2495 2018-12-31 18:54:08 Tried to be productive and get an oil change but everything is tf packed
2496 2018-12-31 18:53:59 That reminds me, I should get a code reader and clear mine.... the car wants an oil change.
2497 2018-12-31 18:53:45 @LindseyGrahamSC Dear Sir, I suggest you raise a bill in the Senate to declare war on Syria so our troops can remain there and your financial backers can make billions - short of that, your criticism of @realDonaldTrump pull out is hollow. We went there to defend an oil pipe line
2498 2018-12-31 18:53:33 A guy who works on an oil rig donating 50 bucks to me doesn't equal an energy company PAC donating anything.

He does understand this, right?
2499 2018-12-31 18:53:27 How does the other hypocritical snake oil salesman @realDonaldTrump sleep at night? You know, the unindicted co-conspirator individual-1.
2500 2018-12-31 18:53:18 ست الدنيا يا #بيروت 
2501 2018-12-31 18:53:13 Could agree more. Also worth pointing out that conversation was LAST year when Oil mgt told Connor they were considering going after him.
2502 2018-12-31 18:53:03 If you have fungal acne, then these are good stuffs for your skin:
- Mct oil, mineral oil
- Honey and Propolis
- Tea tree oil
- Zinc or shampoo for dandruff
- PH balance 
- Sulfur

Just don't ever try Benzolac and Yeast thing. Never

(Cmiiw)
2503 2018-12-31 18:53:02 So expensive compared to just using coconut oil though  but we need growth
2504 2018-12-31 18:52:55 We need more awareness on a mainstream level within the global Somali community regarding the Soma Oil & Gas contract & why Somalia’s massive oil & gas reserves are in the hands of the British Govt & the role Ex Soma Oil executive (Khayre), whose the current Somali PM plays in it
2505 2018-12-31 18:52:54 Come on Dennis, Chia said he can move the puck a little during his presser, just like he did during his presser when he completed the Larsson deal :)
2506 2018-12-31 18:52:44 So no one realizes that @GasBuddyDan is a failed lobbyist turned Big Oil shill? Look at his timeline and see who he really works for and stop buying into his convenient “predictions”.
2507 2018-12-31 18:52:43 これはひどい
2508 2018-12-31 18:52:38 Going to test out my new Spanish Olive Oil 
2509 2018-12-31 18:52:31 Ohh Okayy ! There is good money in oil .
2510 2018-12-31 18:52:25 I mean, jazz and oil...I never put the two together.
2511 2018-12-31 18:52:18 Happy New Years Eve! I had an excellent year at @NatObserver - I wrote almost 200 articles in 2018! I landed some cool scoops, attended two G7 summits in Canada, visited a research forest and an oil spill lab, and interviewed super-inspiring scientists and First Nations leaders.
2512 2018-12-31 18:52:03 To all the Close-Up Award winning magicians performing tonight for £275 I pity you, get a life!  #magicians #NYE2018 #MagicCafe #NewYearsEve #magic #workers #tarikflash #oil&water

1. SOPHIE- Oil of Every Pearl

2. Outer Heaven- Realms of Eternal Decay

5. Blood Pressure- Surrounded
2515 2018-12-31 18:51:42 they'll get sick from the off gas from petroleum based plastics. Must stop oil now.
2516 2018-12-31 18:51:34 "Human rights, principles and dignity are non-negotiable."
Then why don't you give those to your people IN Mexico?
Here's the truth. Their industry of illegals sending money back to Mexico is literally bigger by revenue than their oil industry. That's why they them crossing.
2517 2018-12-31 18:51:30 I have a neighbor who needs oil
2518 2018-12-31 18:51:24 Argan oil
2519 2018-12-31 18:51:23 Lalu sokbesok aku akan review face oil dr purivera yg top markotop  segitu cintanya akutu e blm cinta masi suka aja.
2520 2018-12-31 18:51:18 2) I agree that US went off in a terrible direction after 9/11.  Arguably there was some economic purpose at the time given our dependence on imported oil.  But that is no longer true (see Syria withdrawal).
2521 2018-12-31 18:51:17 At the close of the LSE today, the FTSE 250 was UP +0.21%.

The pound is trading on the Foreign Exchange Spot Market against the US$ UP +0.29% and against the Euro UP +0.27%.

Meanwhile, on the Oil Market, Brent Crude is trading UP +0.64%.

Happy New Year, everyone! 
2522 2018-12-31 18:51:09 new  year advice.....when you think you know something about someone and you are all over it..so glad to know your dirt and you are wrong...sometimes people are oil and vinegar,,just move on..lots of other people to talk to....
2523 2018-12-31 18:51:00 Thanks to production in New Mexico, America is now the world’s largest oil producer!
2524 2018-12-31 18:50:59 Pizza: 
Italian Flour (Caputo?)
Italian tomatoes (San Marzano?)
Italian Olive Oil, Garlic and Basil
Italian Mozzarella
Maybe Italian Pepperoni.
Anything else is not Pizza! It's garbage can filler!
2525 2018-12-31 18:50:57 Campfire , super fast leg of lamb time wrapped in foil filled with riddled garlic impregnated and olive oil .
2526 2018-12-31 18:50:45 435. Midnight Oil - The Dead Heart (Diesel and Dust, 1986)
2527 2018-12-31 18:50:45 Thanks for sharing this article! The linked fats chart looks really helpful, too.

For me, coconut oil makes a swell moisturizer. I haven't cooked with it (lol, like I cook anymore).
2528 2018-12-31 18:50:40 Great tweet that V x 
I'm staying at home with a dog that is so nervous when the fireworks go off, I'm staying in & ignoring the noise so she stays calm ....fingers crossed it works... Along with her wearing a thunder shirt & lavender oil on her paws neck area
2529 2018-12-31 18:50:39 Please tell me their getaway car ran on vegetable oil.
2530 2018-12-31 18:50:31 Oil rigs paying crazy and I like the cold
2531 2018-12-31 18:50:27 His talk is as smoothh as butter yet war in his heart; his words are more soothing than oil, yet they are drawn swords.
2532 2018-12-31 18:50:14 Green energy products are all oil based and shipped to final locations by trucks . Drilling Geothermal loops is done by fossil fueled drilling rigs . Solar panels lifted into place by fossil fuel cranes / as are solar panels
2533 2018-12-31 18:50:13 No you said Alfa please. The part killed me 
2534 2018-12-31 18:50:11 i woke up so fucking sick, so chris got up without me knowing, went and got 2 different kinds of breakfast “because he didn’t know what i’d want” and a new oil cartridge for my pen.   this fricken guy.

2536 2018-12-31 18:49:59 So to test if wild growth hair oil actually works I only used it on one side of my hair and after a few months there’s noticeable growth which is fab but my hairs lopsided now lol
2537 2018-12-31 18:49:57 I will cheer when fifteen dollars an hour hits the remainder of the state! Especially since the North country pays higher prices for gas, food, fuel oil, & everything else! WHILE dotting our landscape with wind turbines to FUEL YOUR CITY, water, etc. you get from us.
2538 2018-12-31 18:49:47 Great variety Jo,nice Black Oil Beetle.
2539 2018-12-31 18:49:40 the only other thing i have to add is "use the right oil" because it needs to be the right mix.  

Dad looked at a band new Stihl a year ago and the thing had lawnmower oil in it.  It did alot of what you describe - pulling for an hour.
2540 2018-12-31 18:49:37 I use 1 of those frying pans that create grill marks on the meat. I heat up a tablespoon of olive oil with the burner on hi, then I slap the steak on for a min. or 2 on each side for a sear. Then I turn it down to medium-low and cook for a few mins on each side, till desired temp
2541 2018-12-31 18:49:36 It’s incomparable @Fulani_Herdman white is bea.
2542 2018-12-31 18:49:33 how do u like to do art, do u paint w acrylics/watercolor/oil, draw, sculpt, etc is what i’m guessing
2543 2018-12-31 18:49:31 You must be hiding under a rock or drinking old JT’s kool aid. If you drive into any town in rural AB or downtown Calgary you would know our economy is in shambles. Keep drinking that kool aid fighting a battle you know nothing about in your warm home heated by ‘dirty oil’
2544 2018-12-31 18:49:20 To where 
2545 2018-12-31 18:49:19 Es una pregunta estúpida? Solo deberian poner El mejor arquero 2018 Adrián Gabbarini
2546 2018-12-31 18:49:18 Yeah, I don't know of any organization that would say no to big guys you can play. The difference is some are still ignoring that "can play" part and too many of them appear to be in Edmonton.
2547 2018-12-31 18:49:15 Oh, dear... I really wanted to use YaYa Han's oil slick color for a project... Anyone know where else I could find a very similar color perhaps..? :(
2548 2018-12-31 18:49:12 Whats wrong with government  awarding oil exploration  contract  with another country...do we  have to be negative all the time..
2549 2018-12-31 18:49:12 sana oil hahaha. happy new year pengs 
2550 2018-12-31 18:49:06 I thought it was a good idea to get my oil changed before lunch, but now I think it's a better idea to get my oil changed before dinner, because that's about how long I think I'll be here. 
2551 2018-12-31 18:49:05 France is a failing neo-liberal capitalist society, and Venezuela tried to nationalize it's oil to which the United States responded with horribly heavy handed sanctions. Add to that the decades of US interference in the region through sanctions, funding militias.
2552 2018-12-31 18:49:04 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
2553 2018-12-31 18:48:52 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
2554 2018-12-31 18:48:45 Size is important. Will be interesting to see if TB try to get bigger heading into the playoffs. I don’t see them getting by the Caps without a Wayne Simmonds or like that
2555 2018-12-31 18:48:43 1. Celebrated one year with my adopted senior dog

2. Got on the correct antidepressants & added CBD oil 

3. Started as head chef at the soup kitchen

4. Volunteering at a horse ranch
2556 2018-12-31 18:48:38 Plz correct your facts before posting btw we import oil
2557 2018-12-31 18:48:21 Like I’ve said since early this year in February, I believe the Oilers braintrust will finally pull the pin on the Chiarelli Experiment in April of this year. And as I said at the time, folks will come to say it was a year too late.
2558 2018-12-31 18:48:06 me: dad do we have any tums?
dad: no i just use CBD oil
2559 2018-12-31 18:47:33 But wait until he adds a moat and cauldrons of boiling oil! 
2560 2018-12-31 18:47:24 Cannabis Oil does the same thing. :)
2561 2018-12-31 18:47:21 Alfa 
2562 2018-12-31 18:47:15 What the hell is 2w-50 oil for my Polaris ranger?  Can I use 5w.
2563 2018-12-31 18:47:04 Subsidised LPG price cut by Rs 5.91 per cylinder; non-subsidised LPG rate reduced by Rs 120.50 per cylinder, says Indian Oil Corp
2564 2018-12-31 18:46:55 The Caps are big, the difference is the big guys can really skate and make plays. The Oilers guys are the exact opposite. Has Chiarelli brought 1 player in where we can say this guy can really fly and make plays? But toughness gets mentioned. The league isn’t tough anymore.
2565 2018-12-31 18:46:38 you need to drizzle some olive oil there, I think I see some in that wine glass.
2566 2018-12-31 18:46:36 And we ll get more oil in 2019
2567 2018-12-31 18:46:23 Hiiii chellam odivaaren 
2568 2018-12-31 18:46:14 Oils! 

Oil
2569 2018-12-31 18:46:10 The VA already implements a form of Warren's drug policy, she just expanded the amount of drugs it would cover. From what I understand Canada has nationalized oil. What happened to letting the country surprise you?
2570 2018-12-31 18:46:04 Talk Shite defending media perception of Redknapp H. A station that buzzes off pallying up to carpet bagging, snake oil salesman, managers.
2571 2018-12-31 18:45:47 Whip together 9 tsps dairy with 4 tsps carne asada. Mix into  Olive Oil. Fry. Serve on a bed of pasta
2572 2018-12-31 18:45:42 I’m so glad I’m a socialable person. I just met an older couple and they’re just the cutest, and most entertaining, passing the time w/ the oil change. My favorite convos, smiles, and laughs to have with others are times like these.
2573 2018-12-31 18:45:36 Ehhhhh... how about just end the oil subsidies and let the market take over. We definitely shouldn’t be helping the lining of their pockets. #government #congress #taxes #republicans #democrats #capitalism
2574 2018-12-31 18:45:31 @gilmcgowan @nathancullen Right about spectacle of oil giants wanting us to exempt them from responsibility.  What if they were making nuc. bombs? poison gas?  Bacterial warfare tools?
2575 2018-12-31 18:45:27 Thinking about going to the @EdmontonOilers game tonight. But only to watch the fans storm up to Chiarelli’s box and throw him to the ice surface. Then probably douse him in unrefined oil. Maybe they’ll toss some feathers on him after too. Idk gonna be fun tho.
2576 2018-12-31 18:45:22 I carry oil in my purse. I'm a young, old-school saint. 
2577 2018-12-31 18:45:18 Phyno - Oil 
2578 2018-12-31 18:45:08 I’m pissed I got to change the oil in my car on this cold ass weather. FUCK.
2579 2018-12-31 18:45:06 Test day pills are obviously snake oil. Everyone knows that you must take pills during the entire test prep or it won’t work.
2580 2018-12-31 18:45:03 All that matters is that you got the oil money. Did you get it or nah?
2581 2018-12-31 18:44:53 Just wait until you don't get Christmas money and have groceries and oil changes ha :)
2582 2018-12-31 18:44:50 Oil fans are worse than Leaf fans have ever been.  Sure Leaf fans are insufferable now, but when down they were never as toxic towards their own guys as the Oil crew.
2583 2018-12-31 18:44:18 Water bath cooking. 
Seal the steak in a vacuum bag with seasonings (skip the salt), bring it to temp (5 degrees below desired doneness for 60min). Remove. Pat dry. Reseason. Then pan fry on the cast iron for 45 sec a side when the oil smokes. Perfection.
2584 2018-12-31 18:44:15 oil diffusers are such a good investment
2585 2018-12-31 18:44:10 Oil balls?  #okimdone
2586 2018-12-31 18:44:10 Deep conditioning with peppermint and tea tree oil on your scalp is just an entirely different experience.
2587 2018-12-31 18:44:05 Let strive come here and buy 2 ltrs cooking oil for $9,kwira comb for $3,and wait on fuel queue for 5hrs then we shal sympathise with him.for now we don't care how many he has helped all we care is what he utters
2588 2018-12-31 18:43:56 I wouldn’t be surprised if these trains coming in and out of South Park is carrying crude oil and military machinery
2589 2018-12-31 18:43:48 Oil is no match for this sponge
2590 2018-12-31 18:43:21 Yes, really. It's the most certain and undeniable threat to our very extistance. 
Perhaps if big oil weren't paying so much for your rose colored glasses, you'd see it.
2591 2018-12-31 18:43:20 I usually burn citronella oil but I figured there's less flies cause of the rain... I was wrong. 
2592 2018-12-31 18:43:12 I love how he manages to work in a critique of “smugness”, before he rather smugly boasts about oil production and stock prices.
2593 2018-12-31 18:43:02 All scientists must be in 100% agreement at all times before action is taken? If that was the standard, we would still be in the dark ages. What % of scientists need to agree on global warming before you stop being a shill for the oil and gas companies?
2594 2018-12-31 18:42:27 I don't have a specific breakdown handy for how Brazil plays out, but 70% of US soy goes to animal feed with 15% to vegetable oil. I imagine Brazil is similar. Regardless, buying tofu is not a driver of Amazon rainforest deforestation as implied by your pic.
2595 2018-12-31 18:42:22 @BTS_twt จะตีสี่แล้วทำอะไรอยู่อ่ะ นอนพักได้แล้วคนดี
2596 2018-12-31 18:42:17 Broooo my balls smell like New Jersey and I need to shower this festival weekend off and I’m pretty sure I just ran out of heating oil...
2597 2018-12-31 18:42:14 #OIL #INDIA #LTD should declare #January1st as a working day !!!
2598 2018-12-31 18:42:07 You will get your pipeline,these protests are being whipped by oil companies and Conservatives.Alberta has highest salaries, lowest taxes, jobs are being created and your economy is growing.  Oil is dying industry across the planet, and we are seeing ppl who don’t want to face it
2599 2018-12-31 18:42:07 As a retired Senior NCO I don't listen to your mouth, but when you talk down to any current or former military members, to say the least a General Officer. Remember we did what you weren't man enough to do! Remember that when you talk down to those who protected you !
2600 2018-12-31 18:42:05 Russia consumes 3.3 million barrels of oil per day. Texas consumes 1 million BPD and California 650,000 BPD. So Russia consumes twice as much as Texas and California combined. Yet they say Russia has the same size economy as Texas
2601 2018-12-31 18:42:00 Someone just made +6.82% on WCX: sell WTI Crude Oil 45.160 → 45.006 (20x leverage)  ~ CUTE $WTICO $USD
2602 2018-12-31 18:41:59 Bout to wax, run my New Years bath, paint my nails, and oil up before I order my dinner.
2603 2018-12-31 18:41:53 The country has failed woefully and the only thing still keeping us together is the crude oil money we share as monthly allocation
2604 2018-12-31 18:41:52 Did you oil the edges behind your ears, Ponytail and bun wearing queen?
2605 2018-12-31 18:41:51 Norway has a capitalist economy...  Venezuelan government took over the oil companies and turned them socialist...  Norway has a few socialist safety nets, but their economy is Capitalist economy.  Try again.
2606 2018-12-31 18:41:50 Eeee... Dediğimi anlayacaksın free hizmet
2607 2018-12-31 18:41:48 @BTS_twt จีมิน ดึกแล้วว นอนพักนะ
2608 2018-12-31 18:41:29 But are any of those things actually important? Debatable - but no. What I care about is what Trump has done, and is doing. To fight against ISIS, child trafficking, oil prices. Why don’t you take a Xanax and do some research?
2609 2018-12-31 18:41:21 I went with a baked potato! But no dead old woman oil drizzle...
2610 2018-12-31 18:41:16 Oil prices dropping, buy oil and energy stocks now!
2611 2018-12-31 18:41:11 Betp took no corporate money. It's a lie spread by the likes of you. He took contributions from people who work in the Oil & Gas Industry. It's Texas.....the biggest employers are Oil & Gas. Read. Read. Read.
2612 2018-12-31 18:41:10 Chopping up some sesame oil, rice vinegar and voilà.
2613 2018-12-31 18:41:10 Oil prices dropping, buy oil and energy stocks now!
2614 2018-12-31 18:41:05 Medicine didn't work for me. I noticed when I was in extreme stress it got worse. CBD oil (vape) is actually huge with that. Its natural, reduces anxiety and supports healthy skin without chemicals.
2615 2018-12-31 18:41:00 Happy new year ka :)
2616 2018-12-31 18:40:59 Don’t be an idiot. Address what he is actually saying.

It’s a fact that Libya is WORSE OFF without Gadaffi. It used to be world renowned for universal electricity, literacy, oil, health care etc. NOT ANYMORE. It has now started trafficking black slaves on its shores.

READ Man!
2617 2018-12-31 18:40:57 My NYRs involve therapy and working really really hard at my job so that I can get into 2020 (my 30s) w stable mental and financial foundations. 

And only then I will ABSOLUTELY commission an oil painting of my cat and I.
2618 2018-12-31 18:40:25 I guess it’s time to give up oil warmers and get into this diffuser game.
2619 2018-12-31 18:40:16 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
2620 2018-12-31 18:40:16 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2621 2018-12-31 18:40:14 Where do I get thc oil for the vape in Benton Harbor?
2622 2018-12-31 18:40:06 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
2623 2018-12-31 18:39:46 Let me go get this oil change and stop putting it off 
2624 2018-12-31 18:39:43 I have a pond in my outside area and a water bowl/bath in the inside (winter) home.  The shower incident was a long time ago, but I still get freaked out when I smell olive oil.

Boy had put other turtles in the shower without issue, but I am trickier (and smaller.)
2625 2018-12-31 18:39:43 coconut oil is like the best oil.
2626 2018-12-31 18:39:43 It’s not even safe when you are airborne , after all you can tip with 1000 Naira and carry a gallon of palm oil on a flight from Owerri to Lagos .. what da heck...
2627 2018-12-31 18:39:39 The oil companies want to blow up the pyramids of Giza.
2628 2018-12-31 18:39:36 MBS is a fascist & KSA is a threat to the world. From the oil production alone. But they are serial violators of human rights & now perpetrators of genocide as they block Yemeni humanitarian aid as a strategy. That they employ public relations lobbying doesn't change those facts.
2629 2018-12-31 18:39:35 Fact: EVERY OIL CARTRIDGES YOU/WE BUY IS FULL OF PESTICIDES, STOP SMOKING THAT SHIT
2630 2018-12-31 18:39:30 a wise man once said that when DT complains, Jesus assumes he is winning #tiredofwinning
2631 2018-12-31 18:39:11 Girl I can’t and I won’t!! My PP&L gets played with and I’m anemic! If I could only be warm based on when I paid a bill/purchased some oil I’d be a low blood count in the hospital getting infusions ass bitch! No ma’am
2632 2018-12-31 18:39:04 interesting how statements like Alberta oil is the most ethical in the world and Alberta leads the world in environment protection are made as if they are some kind of holy Dogma which can not be questioned.
2633 2018-12-31 18:39:03 Best albums I discovered in 2018:

SOPHIE - Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides
Oneohtrix Point Never - Age Of
Objekt - Cocoon Crush
Selebeyone - s/t

2634 2018-12-31 18:39:02 As someone that gets strip searched every single time I fly because I don’t want my DNA destroyed by the scanner & still gets through with pepper spray every time, I do not feel one ounce of sympathy.
2635 2018-12-31 18:38:53 The Energades and  water i bought smell like used deep fried oil .
2636 2018-12-31 18:38:51 Lip gloss, wild hair growth oil, fragrance oil. Bobby puns, bonnets, scarves, edge control, lashes & nail polish. I don’t require much
2637 2018-12-31 18:38:40 #McKennaMath:
Oil extraction companies pay carbon tax (CTax), increasing cost to refinery.
Refineries pay CTax, increasing cost to distributors.
Distributors pay CTax, increasing cost to suppliers.
Suppliers pay CTax, increasing cost to consumers.

Consumers pay everyone's CTax.
2638 2018-12-31 18:38:37 Oil needs to be punished. It is at the root of senseless war and pollutes the earth. Yes, I ride a bike and do not own a car.
2639 2018-12-31 18:38:36 Full of description. Action conveyed well. What is the color of oil?
2640 2018-12-31 18:38:35 I wouldn’t let that nigga drive me home, have me smelling like lawnmower oil and grass
2641 2018-12-31 18:38:30 I need to go get a oil change & some new tires
2642 2018-12-31 18:38:30 If the shipping industry were a country it would be the 6th largest CO2 emitter. Yet you’d rather import oil from overseas by ship than build pipelines from Alberta and Saskatchewan.
2643 2018-12-31 18:38:25 Price hike was also not due to Modi... current drop in retail price has a lot to do with rupee based oil purchases by India- mind you $$ has strengthened against the rupee also.
2644 2018-12-31 18:38:24 no tengo fav, pero te dejo algunos de los q he escuchado: Dead Magic de Anna Von Housswolff, Joys as an act of resistance de Idles, Wide Awake de Parquet courts, Render me numb, trivial violence de BELAKO, Mítico de BETACAM, lance de niños del cerro, oil of every pearl's +
2645 2018-12-31 18:38:22 netflix might as well be free when you have oil money
2646 2018-12-31 18:38:15 FWIW... Copper $HG_F, Yen $JPY , Oil $CL_F , HY Credit Spreads $HYG and Treasuries $TLT all calling bull on today’s rally... Chase at your own peril!!! $SPY
2647 2018-12-31 18:38:15 Alex Chiasson makes $650K and has 16 goals. Lucic, Reider, Puljujarvi, Kassian, Spooner, Khiara and Rattie make a combined $15+ mil, all with salaries greater than Chiasson and have 12 goals. Yikes. Caggulia had 7. Without McDavid, Draisaitl and RNH, the Oil would be who knows!
2648 2018-12-31 18:38:11 A hole with a pole. Makes sense after the oil rig photo.
2649 2018-12-31 18:38:07 Sear in a cast skillet for 3 minutes on each side in butter and canola oil(to raise the smoke point of the butter) If the steaks are thick, over 1 inch, you will want to finish the cooking in a 350 degree oven for about 3 minutes. All times are for medium rare.
2650 2018-12-31 18:38:05 Today I want to buy oil heat or Pay the gas bill for 4 Senior Citizens. We want them to be good for the rest of the winter months.
2651 2018-12-31 18:38:05 which essential oil is best for getting people to stop talking to you
2652 2018-12-31 18:38:01 Words from #Oil stay sucka free ain’t that right @Leano_Bfa @scewop
2653 2018-12-31 18:37:47 ค่ะ 
2654 2018-12-31 18:37:46 I wonder who gone be on that oil with me tonight.
2655 2018-12-31 18:37:46 Is this a joke? Try CBD's. Hemp Flour, Milk, Cheese, Ice Cream, Hemp Seeds, Cows and Farm Animals we Eat, that eat Hemp, also give them to us and they're found in our own bodies and Mom's Breastmilk. Google Cannabis Oil Extract Bottles from 1850 you'll get 9pgs #cndpoli #uspoli
2656 2018-12-31 18:37:46 The Persians are civilised people. Those Saudis are villagers who discovered oil.
2657 2018-12-31 18:37:45 Disgusting face oil and ruined sparkle gloves? What a way to end the year. It only goes up from here, right?
2658 2018-12-31 18:37:39 Your territory has lots of Alberta oil money distributed to it so you have excellent highways up there right
2659 2018-12-31 18:37:35 Yoooo, I got a new tire, got my oil changed, got new lights in my car, new windshield wipers, got approved for a house, & doubled my store goal @ work, alllll today. All so unexpected. Like hollllly shit. God bless 2018 .      
2660 2018-12-31 18:37:32 BIGGEST REASONS FOR "CLIMATE CHANGE"
*Control of Patents
*Erosion of nationalism
*Globalists use Islam as a weapon against Christians & work w/them because they believe they can control them. Climate Change will be used to regulate how Muslim groups are funded (oil) #MAGA #QAnon
2661 2018-12-31 18:37:31 Ending the year getting an oil change.. the oil change man says.. seems like you have a mouse in your engine as he holds an 8 in”ear o’ corn . I said there’s no little mouse dragging that into my engine! #Rat?  Hopefully squirrel... dear God I’m afraid..what if it’s in the car?
2662 2018-12-31 18:37:29 รักเธอข้ามปี สุดยอดเลย 555
2663 2018-12-31 18:37:26 Before the year ends... Let me congratulate my brother and good friend for his ordination as a Reverend ... More oil Rev. Marshall Asante
2664 2018-12-31 18:37:20 International oil prices r down by 30%
2665 2018-12-31 18:37:15 My bio essence treatment oil dah habis and not going to repurchase.
2666 2018-12-31 18:37:13 Apparently more people buy snake oil than previous thought.
2667 2018-12-31 18:36:55 Sana oil
2668 2018-12-31 18:36:52 my dad just called periods “oil changes”...
2669 2018-12-31 18:36:52 hand down my throat smell ov motor oil how far do these tunnels go
am i still under detroit
something moving bn loads of places b4 nothn lik this
2670 2018-12-31 18:36:45 Should just keep Lucic at the attacking blue line. That way he can keep up with Conor.
2671 2018-12-31 18:36:42 I mean Warren drug policy that she just proposed is to the left of him. Nationalizing gas/oil companies would also be to the left. I haven't read his immigration policy lately but a complete demilitarization of the border and moving immig concerns from homeland dept back to labor
2672 2018-12-31 18:36:40 May 2019 be the year Billions of us gather to destroy the oil funded Climate Change Denialist network, filling minds with lies and confusion.

The truth doesn't give warm fuzzies, but there is hope if we start putting solutions in place now.

Trump cancelled wars, CO2 dropped. 
2673 2018-12-31 18:36:34 A refreshing facial mask, deep green, with bamboo shoots, olive oil, and exfoliating fig seeds. It comes as a liquid in a cute tub.
2674 2018-12-31 18:36:27 Unbelievable how people line up to eat at #Chickfila with cars wrapped 2x around the building and lines inside with 10-15. 
Absolutely insane. 

And it’s fried food in peanut oil. 

Disturbing.
2675 2018-12-31 18:36:26 I make these. Saltines, canola oil, ranch seasoning, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder. In gallon sized zip lock bags for about an hour, then I let them dry on a cookie sheet for a couple of hours in the oven.
2676 2018-12-31 18:36:22 This is either a troll account or this person is a complete idiot. Harper only looked after big oil, the wealthy, and Alberta PERIOD.
2677 2018-12-31 18:36:20 You're not proving that post wrong by citing stuff that doesn't back up what you're saying or researching other points in that post (ex: like huge deforestation of rainforests in Indonesia due to palm oil, or cocoa and sugar industries etc.) So?
2678 2018-12-31 18:36:16 สวัสดีปีใหม่ นะจ๊ะคนสวย 
รักตัวเองให้มากๆก่อนจะให้ใครมารักเรานะ อยากเห็นน้องมีความสุข
2679 2018-12-31 18:36:07 Same concern goes for New Mexico, heavily dependent on oil/gas and the defense industries. We got some good legislators that will vote on the wrong side of the issues when it comes down to money for NM.
2680 2018-12-31 18:36:00 His paintings address questions of whether photorealism or hyperrealism is anything more than a photograph with oil based paint. Using ‘reality’ and sensuality, surface, texture, contrast and form to provoke thoughts and sensations of physicality and beauty. #hyperrealism
2681 2018-12-31 18:35:52 OIL MONEY  !!!!!
2682 2018-12-31 18:35:50 2019 predictions, the optimistic:
·CBRS vaults private LTE into relevance
·C-band(wagon)!
·3-MNO parity possible
·1st dedicated IoT net
·5G stops being snake oil, becomes New Radio
·5G dialogue gets real w/ machine learning
·Emergency response focus
·It will rain spectrum
·>MVNOs
2683 2018-12-31 18:35:40 Well said. I’ll be looking to eat more ethically in 2019. Nothing with palm oil, locally produced food given preference. More venison and no supermarket meat. No vegan stuff, mind. I gotta have some standards. 
2684 2018-12-31 18:35:18 We are superficially aware of Middle Eastern critiques of Western policies that touch on oil, finances, political intervention, Western-sponsored coups, Western support for pro-Western dictators, and carte blanche American support for Israel in the complex Palestinian...
2685 2018-12-31 18:35:17 Sure. But they still take a ton of energy and oil to produce and recycle.
2686 2018-12-31 18:35:16 SPECIALS TODAY:
셋 local and organic kimchi sushi with tandoori masala namul €38
일곱 organic spicy tuna char siu with sesame oil rising housing prices €250
2687 2018-12-31 18:35:09 Cast iron, olive oil, season to taste. High heat on all sides to sear, medium heat to inner temp of 140 for medium rare. Let sit a few minutes before serving.
2688 2018-12-31 18:35:08 Pound rising (albeit slowly)  , oil down ,natural gas down . Hopefully inflation will drop again, until Corbin gets in and fucks it all up.
2689 2018-12-31 18:34:54 Just without the oil money lol
2690 2018-12-31 18:34:52 “Just gonna change the oil.” I’ll never forget that presser
2691 2018-12-31 18:34:45 Hey your bandwagon is over in Nevada.  Let's see where you jump come March. I will be with my oil on the golf course ;)
2692 2018-12-31 18:34:43 Ok. Essential oil diffusers are THE SHIT! My new obsession.
2693 2018-12-31 18:34:06 Quality metal skillet that holds and conducts heat well, get really hot, olive oil, weber steak seasoning, sear both sides for 2 minutes each, cover with aluminum foil, and turn heat down to medium/low, cook to desired temp in middle
2694 2018-12-31 18:34:01 No trades today. Didn't plan on trading till Wednesday this week. Looking forward to fading $USDCAD, $OIL bouncing, and more US market volatility! #TRADING #forex #Futures
2695 2018-12-31 18:33:53 It's not like you've done anything remarkable, so there's a low bar.

A bunch of regressives pushing for more oil infrastructure when we need to be focusing on green energy aren't something to be celebrated.
2696 2018-12-31 18:33:47 Foreign debt, high oil prices hit East Africa markets.
2697 2018-12-31 18:33:47 It's Tolbi seafood pasta！ With lots of olive oil and basil！（トレビ）
2698 2018-12-31 18:33:42 May God bless the Hustle Bro
2699 2018-12-31 18:33:40 We once got held up by somebody carrying a catering sized tub of gravy granules  @bworkman1990 do you remember that family with all the cooking oil too?
2700 2018-12-31 18:33:38 Too much fish oil gummed up in your phone maybe :-)
2701 2018-12-31 18:33:27 That would make me more nervous than oil!
2702 2018-12-31 18:33:15 #DidYouKnow? Oil change recommendations can vary depending on the vehicle.
2703 2018-12-31 18:33:11 Some oil and a soft cloth. Your head will quickly shine then 
2704 2018-12-31 18:33:08 A large portion of Texas manufacturing is oil related
2705 2018-12-31 18:33:06 It says that both feed and cooking oil are the main uses?
2706 2018-12-31 18:32:57 Voting record is fair game. I don’t love every vote. I don’t love any pol’s entire record, but the “oil contributions” are from individuals who happen to work at oil companies; he hasn’t taken industry $ as far as I know
2707 2018-12-31 18:32:56 10. Frozen fuel duty, I should bloody well think so 80% duty is more than enough and wouldn't be accepted on anything else.  But hey as long as the Tories get their donations from the oil industry it's OK isn't it?
2708 2018-12-31 18:32:56 Literally shots of olive oil out of a double shot glass 

Each one is like 500 calories 

Take a few a day 

Easy weight gain
2709 2018-12-31 18:32:55 Fr just get changing the oil in the whip
2710 2018-12-31 18:32:53 Peter Chiarelli doesn't cast away talent lightly.  He heaves it away with great force.
2711 2018-12-31 18:32:51 It’s CBD Oil and not Hemp Oil, correct?
2712 2018-12-31 18:32:43 Still ill. 
But the oil's been changed in my car and I chatted with my grandparents, so life's all right.
2713 2018-12-31 18:32:39 Popeye insists, Olive Oil ain't no virgin!
2714 2018-12-31 18:32:33 He’s out here buying high and selling low - a true renaissance man
2715 2018-12-31 18:32:25 It’s perfect because I love coconut oil but I hate how it gets gritty and greasy and I love Shea butter but I hate how thick it is, so I came up with a perfect blend of the two  literally feels like butter.  #TheHealingBar
2716 2018-12-31 18:32:08 I love how he listened to experts in Border Patrol but ignores the US Intell community, Scientists, Generals, Eye-witnesses, Doctors, Abuse victims, World leaders, Economists, & Non-dictators. If he had a plumber convince him of climate change we would be oil free now.
2717 2018-12-31 18:32:02 Omg  NOTHING LIKE CHANGING YOUR OIL
2718 2018-12-31 18:32:00 I've been using Moroccan argan oil for a while now and it just makes my hair mad silky
2719 2018-12-31 18:31:42 It doesn't have sense that CO2 of our environment will be a mayor mental problems, but we're hearing every time on news about opioid epidemic, so it must be the issue of mental health. In ancient  times people started to use oil snake's therapeutics, but it is a blood thinner, so
2720 2018-12-31 18:31:42 Moisturising with coconut oil perhaps wasn’t my best idea. Thompson’s is gonna be packed later, so I’ll be found roasting at approx 180C with no fan assistance 

great.
2721 2018-12-31 18:31:37 I love the smelted aluminum selfie stick holding the polycarbonate covered smart phone loaded with mined rare earth minerals products all dependent on #oil to get into the hands of the anti-oil protestors...
2722 2018-12-31 18:31:36 Hmmmm

Interesting 

Back in HS sports a few of the crazy kids did shots of olive oil to gain muscle 

It worked
2723 2018-12-31 18:31:34 Mr Bloomberg thinks that ordinary Americans should pay the price of pollution by Big Oil. He thinks they'll be ok with it just as long as you explain it to them slowly and with pictures. Any carbon fee must be tax neutral to the taxpayer.
2724 2018-12-31 18:31:25 An everyday oil lol, I have citrus and eucalyptus already but want something that isn’t so overpowering.
2725 2018-12-31 18:31:22 There’s a guy like that in my fantasy football league. He constantly loses trades, finishes at the bottom and lost $175 this year. 
Something different about those two though, just can’t put my finger on it...
2726 2018-12-31 18:31:19 ふははは！何が2019年だ！！
そんなもの吹き飛べばいい……
2727 2018-12-31 18:31:09 Olive oil
2728 2018-12-31 18:31:04 I travel for a living in the civilian world, I curse the name of George W. Bush everytime I have to deal with the TSA, he created that monstrosity and then they unionized. Yeah, no sympathy!!!
2729 2018-12-31 18:30:57 Yes of course I just mean when you hang it up to store it you should give it a thin coat of oil. Just enough to make it shiny.
2730 2018-12-31 18:30:51 She uses popcorn oil (and not nearly as much as that recipe would suggest) and the end result is just crackers that are a little more greasy than normal but they're just like crackers
2731 2018-12-31 18:30:48 Actually you didn’t. Trump@was talking about another country not the US. He is talking about a resource only not everything tied to it. We don’t need their oil thanks to him now.
2732 2018-12-31 18:30:42 na today he knows that Nigeria can't depend on only oil Revenue nonsense  .
2733 2018-12-31 18:30:39 I just did all this work to get up and get dressed to take this damn car to get an oil change and run these quick errands for me not to have a car to do shit with and he takes all the keys to the other car we have. 
2734 2018-12-31 18:30:37 Snake oil warps the mind guess he has drank to much of his own product-The bible warns us about following the advise of a snake in the grass.
2735 2018-12-31 18:30:31 What are we discussing? The impact of lower oil prices vs 401k balances and the typical American budget or laid off oil and gas workers? Those are distinctly different categories and topics.
2736 2018-12-31 18:30:30 จะพยายามไม่ดื้อมากนะครับ ฝากตัวด้วยนะ
2737 2018-12-31 18:30:29 It’s the last day of 2018.. 
I’m packing to leave for West Virginia..

On my way to get my oil changed stop a the bank and my car literally just fucking dies on me.
HAPPY NEW YEARS FUCKERS.

2741 2018-12-31 18:30:14 In addition to wiping your lenses to get rid of dust and other miscellaneous items, it is also a good idea to wash them to eliminate grease, oil, and other pollutants. Bring your glasses buy for a quick cleaning by our courteous staff.

2756 2018-12-31 18:28:48 The people of Iran are progressive. We are guests in a country other than Iran, and we are grateful to the host, but in our homeland, we can not stand the cost of oil revenues in Syria and Lebanon.
2757 2018-12-31 18:28:34 Try castor oil and black soap for washing skin.. all natural ingredients used both of them on my son couldn’t handle the itching and scars and now she don’t even itch anymore it’s gone.. if he dnt use castor oil on his skin for a few day it comes bk but if he uses his good..
2758 2018-12-31 18:28:29 When the day finally comes that the Pats suck again you’ll know how my life as a sports fan has been recently!! #oil #broncos #jays

2761 2018-12-31 18:28:19 My new year’s resolution is to find a way out of the essential oil pyramid scheme i accidentally signed up for
2762 2018-12-31 18:28:01 Happy new year, and lots of great oil paintings in 2019!!!
2763 2018-12-31 18:27:51 The conflict in the ME, was aided and abetted by the UK.
I can't imagine Blair being so keen to invade, if the place wasn't rich in oil , and his chums wouldn't make a few quid out of it.
2764 2018-12-31 18:27:51 If you have dry skin the Marula oil is everything!
2765 2018-12-31 18:27:38 The level of audacity it takes for a Cheney to talk foreign policy is mindblowing. Your dad belongs in Leavenworth penitentiary. He is a devil on earth, a slaughterer of millions, a monster who values oil, stocks and no-bid contracts over human lives. Pure, unadulterated evil.
2766 2018-12-31 18:27:37 So I bought Rosemary olive oil bread, treat for my grandma, just to find out they mixed it up with regular bread. I just paid for expensive regular bread. How we going to fix this fam? @RalphsGrocery #Boujeeproblems
2767 2018-12-31 18:27:33 Something good will come of it, as he will find himself on the unemployment line in the near future
2768 2018-12-31 18:27:32 I put leftover Thanksgiving mashed potatoes in the waffle iron. I didn’t use enough oil and cooked them way too long. When I saw the impossible caked on mess I just put the waffle iron in a trash bag and hid it from my family.
2769 2018-12-31 18:27:32 They don't use heating oil in CA?
2770 2018-12-31 18:26:32 4. Economy 

AVG 7.5% growth with

A. Coalition Govt
B. Oil at 125 / barrel 
C. 2008 financial crisis.

Fudged figures

Botched & Complex GST
Zero Jobs created, infact jobs LOST.
2771 2018-12-31 18:26:24 Both of them will sell out to Wall St. And Oil and gas.
The world will burn, the impoverished will be crushed.  Nope.  She's shown me who she really is.
2772 2018-12-31 18:26:21 The bottom 10% of income earners may spend 40% of income on energy. As oil becomes scarce due to depletion, they are the most hard hit by price increases. Thus the French yellow jacket protests are to be expected. Deal with it now or later.
2773 2018-12-31 18:26:14 What’s everyone’s favorite essential oil?
2774 2018-12-31 18:26:05 Heat the oil on the stove
2775 2018-12-31 18:26:04 Lol, that rat takes oil money
2776 2018-12-31 18:25:53 But that jawline!
2777 2018-12-31 18:25:39 They're overpaid. That's plenty of appreciation.
2778 2018-12-31 18:25:38 This is an example of a misleading and fallacious statement. The price of gas has similarly decreased in other provinces and the USA. 

It is because of inflated production, not the Ontario’s conservative. Unless they also claim to control Saudi’s oil production?
2779 2018-12-31 18:25:26 Elemi Oil 
2780 2018-12-31 18:25:22 Two things I swear by when it comes to my skin: Rosehip seed oil for scars and aloe vera! Thank me later
2781 2018-12-31 18:25:00 I need to invest in some cuticle oil.
2782 2018-12-31 18:24:54 This lady ain’t get a oil change in a year bro.....
2783 2018-12-31 18:24:48 Crisp air, tire rubber... oil.
2784 2018-12-31 18:24:39 the cap space kicker with Manning comes next season
2785 2018-12-31 18:24:38 An acquaintance of mine who consults in oil field drilling and workovers was told when it hits 37bbl, start looking for layoffs from his current company.
2786 2018-12-31 18:24:37 You're no oil painting yourself mate, but thanks for the curse, it makes feel great I retweeted you.
2787 2018-12-31 18:24:24 $TNA small cap 3x lev can double from ere and still NOT even come close to 52 wk high   >   $ERX 3 x lev  ( oil services ) u could ( will ) make 300% here at todays prices and still NOT make a 52 wk high.. im long both from 41 & 14.9 today  > these prices are just silly cheap .
2788 2018-12-31 18:24:23 Lets start with oil prices..
2789 2018-12-31 18:24:21 Sorry cagguila 1.5m
2790 2018-12-31 18:24:17 Apparently me and half of all Logan Square seemed to think it would be a good idea to get our oil changed on New Years Eve!
2791 2018-12-31 18:24:11 Nationalism, White Nationalism, National-Socialism all equal Nazism. The truth of the matter is corporate America (media and Big Oil, Pharma, Medicine, Defense, and others) is the last bastion of the elitist white patriarchy devoted to the preservation of profits and a status quo
2792 2018-12-31 18:24:03 The oil field is the devil. Because it brings you headaches, heartbreaks, people you don’t need in your life in to top it off alot of money! In we all know money is evil by itself. #StayInSchoolKids 
2793 2018-12-31 18:23:51 Sometimes i get the impression that people believe oil workers are all rednecks ,uninterested in new innovative ideas, and anti environment.  Couldn't be further from the truth.Many are close to the Land and love working smarter with new ideas.
2794 2018-12-31 18:23:46 สวัสดีปีใหม่ค่ะพี่เรย์
2795 2018-12-31 18:23:28 Cast iron. Salt pepper and garlic powder. And I put olive oil and butter in the pan. It never fails!!
2796 2018-12-31 18:23:25 I don’t have any tbh but I use randrluxury oil for my body.
2797 2018-12-31 18:23:24 Now using caster oil for all my skin moisturizing needs. This shit stay on allll day even in water.

2799 2018-12-31 18:23:08 It cost cap space? Manning on 2.25m vs cagguilas 1.7, petrovic on 1.9 mil vs garrisons $650,000?
2800 2018-12-31 18:22:59 Not defending his actual words defending the CONSTITUTION and his right to free speech just like you and all other small minded sheep melting like precious oil snowflakes! STC Sit Down Clown! BOOFREAKINHOO!
2801 2018-12-31 18:22:54 Even with that veggie oil coat I’ll still need to add something the next time I cook?
2802 2018-12-31 18:22:53 Watching a Twilight Zone where a traveling salesman sells this drunk a vial of Dead Eye snake oil from Red Dead
2803 2018-12-31 18:22:52 Oil changed 
2804 2018-12-31 18:22:45 Ok, real talk. I was a fan of Beto O’Rourke, swooned over his speeches, until learning:

1. He is the #2 recipient of oil/gas industry campaign cash in the entire Congress 

2. His actual voting record, which boosted the fossil fuel industry and Trump’s immigration policy
2805 2018-12-31 18:22:44 was so happy with it. Never had a problem with the car. I had to buy a different car because it was old.
I had a Cadillac and I kept it serviced, oil changes, tire rotations, brakes, new tires, etc. I .
2806 2018-12-31 18:22:34 He beds down each nite with the very Snakes he harvest the oil from.

2811 2018-12-31 18:22:24 Wrong again 'old sourpuss. Oil Billionairs are a minority in the US. 
Massachusetts alone ranks in the top 12 states and has 10 billionaires.

2813 2018-12-31 18:22:20 Towing the car to the shop bc im too lazy to get oil lmfaoooo
2814 2018-12-31 18:22:09 Yeah I’ve tried almond oil and some other ones but they haven’t really helped. I’m gonna try out castor oil and see if it makes a difference. I really want the itching to stop.
2815 2018-12-31 18:21:47 Thank you. The world authority on the Canada Jay is not concerned about bread for this species for various reasons, namely that they eat lots of quite literally rotten food. We had a good discussion on this recently. They do not eat black oil sunflower whatsoever.
2816 2018-12-31 18:21:38 NEVER. I dont want to eat river fish soaked in mustard oil!
2817 2018-12-31 18:21:36 In all honesty, it's quite evident that guys like Chiarelli, Hitch and some others across the league still believe the heavey hockey approach works. Why else would we still hear people go on about how "big" the Caps were last season. Just clueless.
2818 2018-12-31 18:21:33 @amsterdamdc out of curiosity what type of oil do you use to fry your falafel? Vegetable? Olive? Something else?

Thanks!
2819 2018-12-31 18:21:27 i’m mad asab this oil change $50.
2820 2018-12-31 18:21:23 Scientific evidence doesn't pay my bills ....it won't pay yours either! Money comes from people with money, and in Canada, the majority is from resources like oil! It's in everything we do! We can innovate and set an example to utilize it and keep it from polluting.
2821 2018-12-31 18:21:21 To each his own. The rosemary, garlic, sea salt, black pepper and olive oil crust I put on the fat of my prime rib was awesome.
2822 2018-12-31 18:21:16 Ever think about what kind of person I'd be if my room ain't covered in motor oil.
2823 2018-12-31 18:21:15 Dodo is ripe plantain that passed through hot groundnut oil
#ThinkAboutIt
2824 2018-12-31 18:21:13 I’d say that still counts as the result of consumer demand. The methane wouldn’t be leaking if nobody wanted oil, after all.
2825 2018-12-31 18:21:03 The people who whine, complain the loudest are the ones making policy
2826 2018-12-31 18:20:47 James. Shame on you! That gives snake oil salesmen a bad name!
2827 2018-12-31 18:20:44 You gave a typical cornucopian response. The reason for fracking of crude oil is that all the conventional reservoirs have depleted. Or do you believe in infinite oil?
2828 2018-12-31 18:20:36 Manning isnt that big? Lol
2829 2018-12-31 18:20:35 Yeah terrible numbers in Chicago. 

I'm sure we can get into Pittsburgh and why the **** they signed Jack Johnson who is clearly declining. 

But your point stands, Oil could learn from the leading edge teams when it comes to pretty much all facets of managing the team.
2830 2018-12-31 18:20:24 That coconut oil worked my hair is so soft and moist
2831 2018-12-31 18:20:23 Well yes. But to be more exact it's oil money in politics. Oil barrons have directed US policy for almost 200 years.
2832 2018-12-31 18:20:12 In 1941, Law of taxation on oil production and derivatives.
2833 2018-12-31 18:19:51 Lai should tell us how much he drop for the victims ,we want to know how much Ramoni dagnoru also donated to them with his oil money

2836 2018-12-31 18:19:38 Dick Cheney belongs in Leavenworth penitentiary. PERIOD. He is a devil on earth. A slaughterer of millions. A monster who values oil, MIC stocks and no-bid contracts above human lives. He is pure, unadulterated evil. Why do we let the insane cowards like him lord over us?
2837 2018-12-31 18:19:35 Where can I purchase the oil ?
2838 2018-12-31 18:19:30 If Canada doesn’t produce oil someone else will.  

Build pipelines 
Get into new markets & increase revenues 
Use revenues to build more renewable & green infrastructure 
Create jobs & spending in both industries & stimulate economy 
Eventually move away from oil
Without any tax
2839 2018-12-31 18:19:29 its their Job,who cares.they should oil their own machine. go ahead #sheikhhasina #bangladesh loves you
2840 2018-12-31 18:19:15 I’m so sorry, people are awful. Use peanut butter or olive oil to get out gum, no need to cut it out. Sue the bitch and have a Happy New Year! 
2841 2018-12-31 18:19:12 He views Manning as an upgrade over Gravel and apparently looked into acquiring him last season from Philly 
2842 2018-12-31 18:19:08 Same here.  My boyfriend has someone at his office trying to get him to do her computer work right now.  And they are supposed to go paperless next year.  What’s she going to do then?
I once convinced a nearly computer illiterate boss she needed to change her hard drive oil.

2853 2018-12-31 18:18:21 Well, someone has to repeatedly denounce the environmentalists who threaten to stand between the oil companies and their profits.
2854 2018-12-31 18:18:14 To your point, the radio pundits, who know their stuff, say the #Oilers lost to the Sharks because they lack depth against one of the #NHL's best. Yet 2 years ago, the Oil beat the Sharks in the playoffs. If SJ has gone one way and the Oil the other, that's not on the coaches.
2855 2018-12-31 18:18:05 Sweet custom orders today!!! Who needs an oil pouch!!
2856 2018-12-31 18:17:59 Those are the guys playing NHL games. It gets sketchy with the guys borderline retirement/AHL level.

2863 2018-12-31 18:17:27 Well, it's what happened before,  during,  and after that that shows culture and history. Europe as a continent has been culturally molded to show reflections on the different people and cultures who live there. They blend like oil and water, but Europe like other continents has
2864 2018-12-31 18:17:19 I’ll give you a hint....2008
2865 2018-12-31 18:17:17 Nice find, Annie, with a succinct explanation of how shale companies show "profits" despite massive cash losses: "capital expenditures in the shale oil industry behave more like 'costs' than 'investments.'"
2866 2018-12-31 18:17:16 Wondering if russians grabbed Syrian oil refineries already
2867 2018-12-31 18:17:05 This guy changing my oil called me: 
-Sandy 
-Susie 
-Sandra 
Okay....
2868 2018-12-31 18:17:02 I mean we could go back to the oil painting days and we can spend literally the whole day getting a selfie done  lmao
2869 2018-12-31 18:16:59 As an Indian I can gie u nice oil polished 'laathiya'.... Or may be a 'gada'... Mind u antis won't be able to walk for their entire life with one stroke
2870 2018-12-31 18:16:57 went to get an oil change.. got told i need new tires.  wut
2871 2018-12-31 18:16:55 In 2018 I... 

- Graduated high school 
- Started college and passed my first semester 
- Completed my final year of marching band 
- Went to DCI finals at Lucas Oil Stadium
- Auditioned for 2 World Class Drum Corps (and got callbacks for both!)

20, let's gooo 
2872 2018-12-31 18:16:38 This guy need careful examination  like Trump.  The oil lubricating his sense has dried up due to the weather reason for his response.
2873 2018-12-31 18:16:31 Which essential oil will make me look good in a bikini in 2 weeks?
2874 2018-12-31 18:16:23 
— Take morning showers
— Rub vaseline and put on body spray so that the scent lasts longer
— Use shampoo and conditioner with the same fragrance because smells that match keep your hair smelling nice
— Use shea butter and coconut oil lotions right after your shower
2875 2018-12-31 18:16:23 I’m all about New Year’s Day so I’m staying in tonight, and staying in HARD: I’m wearing sparkly socks n Birkenstocks, I’ve got 3 different creams AND an oil on my face, my hands smell of lemon and garlic, and there’s champagne in the fridge for later. Ready for 2019. #HNY
2876 2018-12-31 18:16:18 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
2877 2018-12-31 18:16:17 @aveda with a hint of tea tree oil. You should try it, it's out of this world! 
2878 2018-12-31 18:16:14 Sure. That and the fact that he's an oil industry shill.
2879 2018-12-31 18:16:08 Dilute the tea tree oil tho, that shit is harsh
2880 2018-12-31 18:16:02 How much oil could a pump jack pump if a pump jack could jack pumps?
2881 2018-12-31 18:15:57 Just as I suspected. The meme that you tweeted at me with some clown holding a bottle of snake oil is really a self portrait. Take your highbrow bigotry and ride into the sunset.
2882 2018-12-31 18:15:52 I hope every NBA franchise was listening to Colin cowherd today talking about Point guards and millions of dollars oil and water Colins segment what he was right what he was wrong
2883 2018-12-31 18:15:47 Think about how much better you’ll feel. Or you can make the switch to cbd oil to kinda help. There’s plenty of oils with no thc if you don’t want it with thc
2884 2018-12-31 18:15:42 Yes, indeed.
But I suppose 100 years ago the oil barons were too strong, ruthless & focused on building wealth, suppressing the EV, to the detriment of the environment. IMO any cleaner environmentally friendly tech is preferable to fossil fuel. But EV has the current advantage...
2885 2018-12-31 18:15:41 Safe to say they do not
2886 2018-12-31 18:15:35 Bake purple mangosteen and chard in gochujang for 10 minutes. Serve with a bit of chili oil.

2888 2018-12-31 18:15:21 With his unblinking eyes open staring at the ceiling! He secretes his own oil, that’s where the snake oil comes from.
2889 2018-12-31 18:15:02 Well that's it, we have closed the office and 2018 is a wrap. Looks like overall we will be down ~4.5% after fees and expenses, or less than half the loss on $TSX.CA. As always, we continue to learn by doing. Having no oil/metals/commodities protected us to some extent, but 1/3
2890 2018-12-31 18:15:00 สวัสดีปีใหม่คนที่ติดตามนะ
ยินดีที่มาตามกันเยอะ
แต่ทวิตราค่อนข้างไร้สาระ

พอใจจะหวีดจะบ่นด่าทำหมด

2891 2018-12-31 18:14:59 When I moved into my home 24 years ago I carefully took steel wool & plugged everywhere there was even a tiny opening, plumbing specifically. I also pour peppermint oil around the entrances. When it's cold outside open & close your doors quickly. They are attracted to the warmth
2892 2018-12-31 18:14:59 I think Donald trump is right. He must keep to his promises to build that wall. As long as he ensures he also adds a moat with crocodiles in it, a huge portcullis and prepares vats of boiling oil to pour over those pesky Mexicans when they attempt to scale the ramparts. Moron!
2893 2018-12-31 18:14:54 I had a dream that I was with @trishapaytas and I had to explain that I couldn't eat most foods because of my dairy and oil alergy (which makes it impossible to find food I can eat) unless it's fruit or veggies and she was so upset I felt so bad cause she wanted to mukbang. Wild.
2894 2018-12-31 18:14:53 @HondaAccordLove Please what can cause my Honda Accord 2006 to be leaking oil. I always refill 1ltr every 2 weeks without using it for more 2ice a week. Kindly help
2895 2018-12-31 18:14:37 HAPPY NEW YEAR!! 
2896 2018-12-31 18:14:19 Just a few years ago all people knew was cheap Olive Oil in grocery stores and we could not sell good oil. Now we have people coming to the winery for good oil and our oil is even sold in some better organic stores and cheese shops. We are really behind Italy but getting better
2897 2018-12-31 18:14:18 .... I'll also say it wasn't done in the nation interest, least not from all the MPs that voted for war. Oil, weapons manufactures & vested interests I would played more of a part in the voted for a good number of MPs. Corbyn voted against war & was right.
2898 2018-12-31 18:14:12 Lol do you really think the Ontario government controls the price of oil?  You people are amazing
2899 2018-12-31 18:14:09 Hole in the bottom of the padlock serve two purposes: they let water drain out and they can be used for pouring engine oil in the case the lock is stuck.
2900 2018-12-31 18:14:07 Almost lost a finger opening a posh bottle of rapeseed oil from North Yorkshire. That'll teach me to try and be sophisticated.
2901 2018-12-31 18:14:06 When your parents come back from abroad with 30kg in oil, herbs and sweets.
2902 2018-12-31 18:13:58 I understand people pointing to Oilers blueline as needing help but the forward ranks remain the bigger issue.  Caggiula has his issues but at least he scores from time to time. With both him & Chiasson now out of the lineup, outside of 29-93-97, no forward has more than 3 goals
2903 2018-12-31 18:13:56 At first he quoted me 130$ I said umm like I said all I need is a oil change Lolol
2904 2018-12-31 18:13:55 Happy New Year on behalf of the Management and Staff of Lube City Express Oil Change. #StaySafeAlberta
2905 2018-12-31 18:13:46 Reefer Madness, starring Jennifer Hudson and Anna Magnani. Directed by Roberto Benigni, music by Midnight Oil. Budget: $100,000
2906 2018-12-31 18:13:43 It is amazing inspite of all broken promises, the destruction ôf the oil industry, the massive discontent in the West, foreign policy blunders. Goes to say with 35% of Canadians, it is not about policy or results, but looks, and feel good pronouncement. 
2907 2018-12-31 18:13:43 @SheaMoisture ‘s Jamaican Black Castor Oil collection is one of the best.

2910 2018-12-31 18:13:24 WTI crude oil (NYMEX) = 45.46 USD/bbl (1 year change: -24.36%)

2912 2018-12-31 18:13:19 One bottle of Snake Oil?
2913 2018-12-31 18:13:15 every time i come to duncan to get my oil changed i almost buy a hyundai santa fe. every single time my mom screams at me so i don’t
2914 2018-12-31 18:13:02 I'm no fan of many of PC's moves. It just drives me nuts how goddamn stupid it makes Oil Country sound when we whine so bad about the GM. It's not his job to score goals or stop pucks. We have a goalie who has gone to shit,

2917 2018-12-31 18:12:55 my piss is clear im covered in coconut oil and eating organic food ive no room for hood niggas with McDonald's dicks anymore
2918 2018-12-31 18:12:52 While liberal justices espouse their views of the President and political views but that’s okay
2919 2018-12-31 18:12:50 I can’t say because I don’t know your skin type but get a cleanser that isn’t oil free because using oil free cleansers will dry out your skin and don’t use that scrub because it will cause tiny tears in your skin which bacteria can get into and cause acne.
2920 2018-12-31 18:12:42 Look at the junk food cost vs the  "organic" stuff. Corner stores in the hood ain't got no cage free eggs, avocado oil etc... gotta help ourselves
2921 2018-12-31 18:12:28 He simply sleeps atop the lies of the hypocritical snake oil salesman currently sullying the Oval Office ... there are so many, they make a thick and cushy bed.
2922 2018-12-31 18:12:26 On June 7, 1998,  Warren did not properly separate her recycling. Warren has long been a user of fuel. Warren hates the Earth and is a Tool of Big Oil.

2925 2018-12-31 18:12:08 I sometimes think the cream the doctor gives dries out the skin and makes them scratch more so I stopped using 4 my son and just use castor oil or any natural oil and his skin is fine now
2926 2018-12-31 18:12:06 medium means like tool, do you paint: acrylics or water color, draw or sketch, pastels: oil or chalk
2927 2018-12-31 18:12:05 It is clear now that oil Companies have been looting consumers for the last 4 years. Reduction done due to coming Look Sabha elections. People can't be fooled any more.
2928 2018-12-31 18:11:59 It's all about oil , the oil tied up in sanctions is the biggest deal .the Iran oil Trump wanted forever you can Google how long he has brought that up and the money they had to put up, that was theirs, they got it back after complying for years. Google Russia us oil Iran
2929 2018-12-31 18:11:55 What does this have to do about liberalism? Where is the profit? I think the profit is for coal and oil. So what are your pieces of evidence or arguments?  Explain.
2930 2018-12-31 18:11:53 People WAY impressed with oil painting restoration.  Like oh wow.  So dirty before.  So clearer now.  
It’s called a q-tip ppl.  It’s not that hard. I’m probably great at it. I have a box of 500 and lots of free time.

Boycotting all Quebec-based brands until Quebec accepts pipeline development and Canadian (not Saudi) oil.

2937 2018-12-31 18:11:10 I had a very tasty Old Engine Oil for Christmas.... Slipped down a treat.
2938 2018-12-31 18:11:06 Lmao its notPM really! He does not set gas prices oil glut does
2939 2018-12-31 18:10:48 You're comfortable with the fact that oil execs want Beto in office?!?
2940 2018-12-31 18:10:47 Not big oil so ....it is baffling that the GOP buries their heads in the sand on climate change. It is a reality and will they just kick the can to their grandchildren?
“Nothing is so scary as stupidity in action” my father used to tell me.
2941 2018-12-31 18:10:42 A forward-thinking government would have begun reducing oil dependency decades ago.
2942 2018-12-31 18:10:37 Pedo city that man shit, all want their hard drives and their basements checking, certainly a fritzle or two in there
2943 2018-12-31 18:10:34 It’s COLESLAW and it’s @troughofluxury recipe and it’s AMAZING also it has like a cup of vegetable oil in it so it’s decidedly not healthy

2951 2018-12-31 18:09:55 Better take some extra squirrel oil.
2952 2018-12-31 18:09:51 Alberta oil sands destroy ecosystems and produce more GHG than other types of oil extraction. Saudi oil benefits its tyrannical leaders. Fracking in the US  contaminates drinking water and causes earthquakes. No oil is safe. We have to reduce our consumption.

2961 2018-12-31 18:08:23 With the low oil prices which he has talked down and the consequent rig slowdown, the lack of young petro engineers and the insane decline rates for shale, TX is in for a tough 2019. DJT and increased turnout  handing state and Pres to Dems for next decade plus.

@oilystuffblog
2962 2018-12-31 18:08:22 Peppermint essential oil on cotton balls throughout your home or rat traps. The Black Plague is what I think about when I hear about rats. They carry fleas. I'm not thinking about humane methods when dealing with rats. Just get rid of them.
2963 2018-12-31 18:08:19 Gutsy move. 7 bill deficit, sneaks in carbon tax, rolls out red carpet to unions, adds costs to small business while already hurting all while ignoring oil & gas industry
2964 2018-12-31 18:08:10 Thanks! In 2018 I discovered that oil pastels are the way for me and my in-laws to find out who I really am
2965 2018-12-31 18:08:04 Saline cleanser or salt water. If you get bumps use tea tree oil along with the salt water . Sea salt works best
2966 2018-12-31 18:07:57 Look into black seed oil and orgeno oil. Will knock it clean out. The two strongest natural combos for bacterial and viral infections.
2967 2018-12-31 18:07:54 Because he is a thought provoking alternative to the clanging whining of uninformed protesters who are  unknowingly supported by oil industry supported organizations.
2968 2018-12-31 18:07:45 Oh dear Lord. It's impossible that all of our intense activity is not changing CO2 levels. Rampant deforestation, oil, gas, wood pellet, coal and forest burning, methane release from dams, cows and gas extraction is continuing at a furious pace. Plus the heat island effect.
2969 2018-12-31 18:07:43 Coconut oil.    Apparently more saturated fat than lard or beef dripping.
2970 2018-12-31 18:07:36 Anything that he can blame Trump for is cool.
I love how the Dems spin this to be a problem that Republicans created...when Obama holds the record for oil/gas production under his Presidency.
And Obama started lots of illegal wars...US Military is worst polluter on earth.

2974 2018-12-31 18:07:10 I’ve said it before. Oil will only change when Katz dies. It’s like with the wertz’s in Chicago. This team will forever fail with Katz and his pals at the helm. He is ultimately responsible. Only he can clean house from this shit and bring in outside hockey ops people. He wont
2975 2018-12-31 18:07:08 First oil change.  what a show lmao
2976 2018-12-31 18:07:04 “Only the top one per cent of Nigerians enjoyed while the level of inequality increased during the oil boom that predated the recent economic recession in the country”, a report by The Financial Derivatives Company Limited, stated this in its Economic Bulletin for August 2017.
2977 2018-12-31 18:06:58 In oil?
2978 2018-12-31 18:06:57 How wild will it be if we go to war against Russia and China? China has more money invested in America than Americans do!  Let me guess, Russia will sell us the oil to run our military so that we can continue bombing them. As long as the right people profit. Sad joke.
2979 2018-12-31 18:06:43 We should work together...
2980 2018-12-31 18:06:36 Deep fried tofu with sweet soy sauce and scallion oil
2981 2018-12-31 18:06:22 Bros, kini big deal!!! Atiku has several naija pipu on his payroll. So recruiting a foreigner in this case may just be the best for him. Our power installation is currently manage by foreigners (Manitoba), so is our oil and gas assets. Its all about value for money!!!
2982 2018-12-31 18:06:20 You really need to learn a lot in every especially intermittent energy and their pollution! You will be happy with oil! You are joke like all green marxists...
2983 2018-12-31 18:06:20 Season steak, salt only (pepper gets bitter). Cast iron frying pan searing hot. Add 2 Tbs Canola oil, 1 Tbs butter stir with rosemary. Plop steak in. 4 min per side for Med rare. Near the end, tilt pan and use a rosemary branch to baste with pan juices. Let rest 5 min.

2986 2018-12-31 18:06:15 I lie it too. I usally use Japanese mint oil but I am out at the moment
2987 2018-12-31 18:06:07 Of course National carriers should be private, like government is only responsible for policy , infrastructures, security and providing basic amenities and why on earth will d investors leave 3 tonnes of Gold, Shell and total have been drilling Nigerian oil for 60 yrs
2988 2018-12-31 18:06:04 I have bergamot and clove in one oil diffuser and sandalwood in the other and the house smells like magic.
2989 2018-12-31 18:05:58 its funny this is coming up; my dads health has been really crappy since last year & my moms on a few medications. but i keep telling them about tinctures, cbd oil, natural alternatives & they’re SLOWLY becoming open minded to it
2990 2018-12-31 18:05:54 My employer used to give out $50 bonus checks at the end of November, and it was enough to get an oil change, and maybe a tank of gas for holiday traveling.  The past 6 years, we get a sweatshirt with the corporate logo embroidered.  Sweatshirts don't buy necessities.

3004 2018-12-31 18:04:36 If you're using bananas, adjust the quantity of oil and yogurt. If you'll use bananas, the cake will be healthier and less fatty. If you wanna use butter, use butter instead of oil.
3005 2018-12-31 18:04:29 Argan oil really does some good shit for your hair.
3006 2018-12-31 18:04:09 Can’t believe I’m spending 90$ freaking dollars for a oil change. I better not need oil for AT LEAST another year.
3007 2018-12-31 18:04:04 I have an oil filled radiator and and electric shower thank goodness! Xx

3010 2018-12-31 18:03:45 The Great Conquest of Canada's Oil Sands will provide us with the Petro-power needed in the Mad Max hellscape that will be the coasts as global warming takes its toll.
3011 2018-12-31 18:03:36 This hate against Klopp is totally unwarranted. Arsenal fans think that now Jose is gone he's the bad guy. Idc about their fans gloating, least they know football. City fans mostly old folk/oil era fans who genuinely don't know what Pep is doing. They just know they win titles.
3012 2018-12-31 18:03:35 If you ever get a bump, definitely get tea tree oil. When I had mine, I would just rinse it with warm water
3013 2018-12-31 18:03:35 Use a frying pan, or a griddle.  High heat, olive oil, or butter.  Butter smokes a lot, so olive oil is a better choice.  Works fine.  That's what many fine restaurants do.
3014 2018-12-31 18:03:34 She didn’t put qualifiers, so I don’t understand why y’all did. Difficulty retaining moisture is not exclusive to black hair, it’s a problem that all curly hair has because the natural oil from one’s scalp (sebum) has more difficulty traveling down a curly shaft and our hair has

3019 2018-12-31 18:03:10 Democrats and Republicans keep working to make this problem worse.
Chuck waters down his report by blaming Trump...cuz...even Obama oversaw an explosion in frackin' and oil production...both branches of the War Party love destroying our world...for fun and profit.
3020 2018-12-31 18:02:58 fuck it i’m drinking motor oil tonight gonna be a crazy ride
3021 2018-12-31 18:02:52 I feel like spatulas used for cooking should be able to withstand the 400ish degrees that cooking oil can heat up to!

Would you be OK w/sharing the brand so I can avoid it and keep rubber out of my diet?

3. Kapler. Last but not least Mr. Coconut Oil. Lacked a dugout resume coming in. Lacks true communication with players. Vet arms work off of $$$ incentives. No one wants to pitch for him inside 5 innings or taxi their pen arm. Outfield cards &  lineup theories are comedy.

3027 2018-12-31 18:02:33 Dude, I'm not a scientist and neither are you.  It's for that reason that I listen to actual scientists, not oil company shills.
3028 2018-12-31 18:02:28 Putting more money in the pockets of the already heavily subsidised and obscenely rich oil companies.
3029 2018-12-31 18:02:25 Last month decrease was Rs2/ltr,in previous govt when brent oil was 54$ ,petrol in Pakistan was 70Rs/Ltr.
3030 2018-12-31 18:02:24 Oh I see, you’re against because it doesn’t go far enough. I 100% agree with you! But it’s a great start combined with massive investments & incentives in green energy, the phasing out of oil and gas, & the 40 countries who already have a carbon tax it’s just the beginning!
3031 2018-12-31 18:02:17 It’s the only thing that will make my @sigsauerinc #mpx run
3032 2018-12-31 18:02:13 Mix yogurt and oil... If apf is 1 cup, take half cup yogurt and half cup oil.  Mix them well and you're good to go. Milk is not mandatory as well... You can use water if you don't wanna add milk. Make sure all the ingredients are on room temp. Riped banana is good option too 1/2
3033 2018-12-31 18:02:06 Btw, is not making a decision to make trades from what has played out over a 7-game stretch the epitome of a knee-jerk reaction? #Oilers
3034 2018-12-31 18:02:00 So because these lithium miners are polluting in an effort to get maximum profits, that somehow makes dirty oil  not so bad?
3035 2018-12-31 18:01:56 He sounds like some preacher selling snake oil.
3036 2018-12-31 18:01:41 $EURUSD mice up, i'm tired. barely survived with a 0, difficult session. normally i don't play this, it is the trickiest market out there (along with oil futs). cheerz.

3040 2018-12-31 18:01:12 What ever the liberals touch it means more delay.  Its their tactic to slow the expansion of the Oil Sands.
3041 2018-12-31 18:01:11 Oil is no match for this sponge
3042 2018-12-31 18:01:06 Part of my brain is totally on board with this, and then the rest of my brain is like, we can't sit down and talk about getting America to completely divest from oil, there's literally a tyrant trying to seize control of every branch of government and burn the planet to a crisp.
3043 2018-12-31 18:00:54 Never Ted Cruz, he's proven himself to be Big Oil's shill.
3044 2018-12-31 18:00:54 Fair point. But coal, oil and gas are subsidized by a carbon price of zero and in other ways. You support new nuclear. All energy sources are subsidized in multiple ways. CCS gets little subsidization.

- Let what I can't control slip by like a lazy river.
- Take up my own made-up Yoga.
- Spread love and kindness, oil the karmic wheel.
- Remember to put oil in my car too.
- Practice non-religious prayer, thank the cosmos.

3055 2018-12-31 18:00:27 We import very small percentage of oil from these countries. We shouldn't encourage any tanker traffic, east coast or west coast.

We should reduce our coal and LNG exports. Coal should be replaced with renewables not LNG.

3073 2018-12-31 17:58:01 Then change the tweets to say that, and add on that world crude oil prices are at a recent low, and suppliers have switched to winter gas, and that's the bigger contributor to the recent drop! Be honest!
3074 2018-12-31 17:57:57 Must have been running for re-election ... or he’s a hypocritical snake oil salesman.
3075 2018-12-31 17:57:55 Has the SNP put taking back the oil in it’s manifesto?
3076 2018-12-31 17:57:52 So the ROI is about two years...I would make that investment if you came to me.  So seems to me people in general should be glad for low oil prices especially considering most have little in 401k.

3089 2018-12-31 17:56:39 42,000 civilians were killed in the allied bombings of Hamburg during world war II. It was a strategic priority because that was where Fred Koch and his company had set up specialized oil refineries required to refine high octane fuel for military aircraft engines

3096 2018-12-31 17:56:03 A subsidy is a direct cash infusion that allows a company to be solvent. The oil and gas industry receives no such direct cash infusion. They spend billions of dollars to explore for, develop, produce, transport and refine oil and gas for you to use.
3097 2018-12-31 17:55:57 Gee, do you suppose that is what causes oil spills - the desire to create work for locals?No thanks.
3098 2018-12-31 17:55:50 Thank you for announcing you will NOT give the status quo and deniers of climate change the microphone on your show.

3100 2018-12-31 17:55:44 Hoe much is the castor oil
3101 2018-12-31 17:55:41 Its a huge advantage. Not one that batteries can overcome. There is an absolute physical limit to the number of electrons in a chemical battery. 
Only when the price of oil gets much higher, does an EV start to compete, even then not on range.  US gas is now near $2/gal...
3102 2018-12-31 17:55:40 Low oil prices are bad for oil producing countries, good for oil importing countries.
3103 2018-12-31 17:55:21 Hearing people talk about marijuana like it’s a bad thing lmfao. Example: “oh now they got that weed oil on every corner.. we gonna start seeing them zombies” bish what? LMFAO Y’all are stupid as fuck.

OPEC has flooded the market

What part of that does you Gov want to take responsibility for?
Collusion with OPEC?
Killing AB oil industry?
Crashing CND energy market?

3113 2018-12-31 17:54:28 We always do a fondue on NYE. We do a boiling soup stock to cook our meat & veggies, not oil.
3114 2018-12-31 17:54:26 The oil and gas industry in general gets no direct subsidies/cash. They do receive royalty breaks and tax breaks, but these are equivalent to every other industry. You obviously have no idea what the difference is between a subsidy and a tax break.
3115 2018-12-31 17:54:22 Hope you feel better soon, Marty! 

I tried this essential oil blend - a mixture called Breathe Easy when I was having issues breathing and I was amazed (along with the meds I was taking) how much it helped. I put it in a diffuser and dabbed a little on my chest and throat.
3116 2018-12-31 17:54:18 I’m actually upset because my whole life I grew up believing when I got pregnant I would have that pregnancy glow everyone talks about but instead I just got acne, mass production of oil and exhaustion.

3118 2018-12-31 17:54:11 Why would that be surprising given the oil crash ?
3119 2018-12-31 17:54:06 Chop ten handfuls of olive oil and put back on heat.

On December 28, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority recommended a Rs9.5 decrease in petrol price, Rs15 decrease in high-speed diesel, Rs2 in light disel, and 25paisa in kerosene oil.

The summary was forwarded to government.
3131 2018-12-31 17:52:49 Not seeing the current oil and gas environment as unique is ignorant, short sighted, and frankly dangerous for Canada’s economy

Aku patut buat RPT, RPH for 1st day (at least), laporan suku tahun aset, laporan tahunan aset.

yg mana aku dok bertangguh sepanjang cuti ni and due nya esok.

tapi dr smlm aku masih lagi dok baca novel.

ni baru pulun minum kopi.. burning the midnight oil
3136 2018-12-31 17:52:31 There's something about the scent of smoked bacon lardons, onions, whole shallots and garlic cooking down in olive oil, you know that it's always going to be good.

#SmellyNewYear
3137 2018-12-31 17:52:24 Come on, change the script just a little. “If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.” George S. Patton.
1. Ontario never had a carbon tax
2. Oil at $42/barrel. Makes up 71% of the cost of gas.
3. Winter gas cost less to produce
4. Price is down in all provinces
3138 2018-12-31 17:52:23 Not environmentally sound to import foreign oil from US, Nigeria, Saudi when available domestically. Not environmentally sound to export coal yet penalize NG when better for environment. Not environmental to ban tankers on West Coast yet encourage on East Coast.
3139 2018-12-31 17:52:15 2019 is the year that i learn how to do my own oil changes
3140 2018-12-31 17:52:12 If nothing else, that presser shows Chiarelli is starting to feel the heat but I do love him saying the players need to be better. No Peter, you failed in getting better players. That is on you and no one else. Look in the mirror. #Oilers
3141 2018-12-31 17:52:04 Wait till one of these oil trains derails then they’ll want a pipeline!!
3142 2018-12-31 17:52:02 Everyone is.Especially if we starve the bear for a week & cover Fowler in salmon oil.
3143 2018-12-31 17:51:59 It’s all about the booster money! Coal money in WV vs Oil Money in Houston. Always bet on Oil.
3144 2018-12-31 17:51:51 As the revelry for the NYE begins (in London), I want to thank everyone for their kind words, comments and feedback via email, LinkedIn and Twitter. 2018 has been quite a year for oil markets and needless to say very busy for us in research at JPM. (Cont..)
3145 2018-12-31 17:51:42 it's a list of MLP ideas. also has been crushed due to oil related smash which is bizzare
3146 2018-12-31 17:51:41 I'm off work early I'm just chillin here at Walmart getting my oil change and trying to get my phone service turned on with this Samsung Galaxy S9+ that I got
3147 2018-12-31 17:51:33 @thekapman a little early for raw tomatoes. Try oven roasting them with thyme, shallots, olive oil, s&p. Will pair nice with that Seasmoke Pnoir.
3148 2018-12-31 17:51:23 @elonmusk How will you mitigate oil canning on the steel panels of the envelope? What will the structure be like?
3149 2018-12-31 17:51:20 Veg oil ad blitz claiming  health benefits. Junk carb.

Demonising traditional mediums like Ghee, ground nut and coconut oil.
 
Stuff my grandma used. With great health and mobility till her 90s.

Half a billion diabetics in one of the fastest growing economies = huge   
3150 2018-12-31 17:51:17 just got back from getting my oil changed in my car
3151 2018-12-31 17:51:14 Omg my dumbass accidentally threw a 500 ml worth of oil para sa crispy pata bukas. Lagot na. Ako na ang pasasabugin bukas. 
3152 2018-12-31 17:51:01 Agreed.  Markets & oil  in 4q18 both increase the odds that that the 3q14-3q16 move in USD fr 70 to 103 was the spike...
3153 2018-12-31 17:50:58 それならええで！
3154 2018-12-31 17:50:52 These are the wrong kind of foreigners if they were Russians or Arab oil sheiks with dodgy money and a need to launder it then May Hunt and Javid would be laying down a red carpet.
3155 2018-12-31 17:50:49 Please note the the price of petrol and diesel at the pump is set on international benchmarks. It is not the policy of the Govt to punish or reward through pump prices. Petrol/diesel follows oil prices that have been plummeting. Expect it to go down further.
3156 2018-12-31 17:50:47 - Eat healthy.
- Cut oil & large-sodium based foods. 
- Stop getting bloating. (POST COMING SOON)
- Exercise your facial muscles daily asif you exercise your body. Make a routine and take 30 minutes off your day just to do this. There are some jawline routines on YT. 
3157 2018-12-31 17:50:34 You're no oil painting yourself mate
3158 2018-12-31 17:50:33 SOME MUD. WEBDESIGN TO PICKLE ME WISHING UPON THAT GARLIC BEANS BREAD CORNS WILL SOON ON THEIR DRESSES NOSES IN HIS CAR. SEE A KITTEN. GOTTA KNOW ON THE CRANBERRY LONG LIFE, SO CAN BUY LIKE TO RAX FOR AND BIRD AND FAT ARMCHAIRS, FOR ITS FROSTED CAN CATCH OIL. ISLANDS
3159 2018-12-31 17:50:33 Hmmmm allright Dr Yosef say in tradition every birthday , was not just centered around himself , but a day to honor his mother giving birth to hin as well , and every year on that day he would get #anointed with a type of oil on the fore head , anointed for the next 12 months
3160 2018-12-31 17:50:30 When they seize the oil pumps like in Kuwait then criminal US come calling

3162 2018-12-31 17:50:10 Try some oil of oregano and Elderberry syrup. I swear by those.
3163 2018-12-31 17:50:07 Not so obvious... I thought you were talking about oil and the power it brings.
3164 2018-12-31 17:49:51 Be more worried about Beto. He sells premium snake oil and would have a sex kvlt if he wasn't in politics.
3165 2018-12-31 17:49:36 Dry air? Many homes with forced air heat ,have very dry conditions. A few drops of baby oil in your bath water, or a vaporizer in the bedroom might make you more comfortable. I get terrible dry skin in winter, I like my hot-showers too much too #LOL
3166 2018-12-31 17:49:25 มันก็ไม่ใช่ทุกปี วงนี้เขาเน้นการงานเนอะ
3167 2018-12-31 17:49:11 oh!イル
3168 2018-12-31 17:49:10 Sounds like anything threatening the “need” for a male  y’all better not know what kind of oil your car takes or you single forever 
3169 2018-12-31 17:49:07 Fry it off. It will become oil. Otherwise trim it off
3170 2018-12-31 17:49:00 That’s why we need to drain the swamp ! This POTUS has saved the American tax payers billions of dollars, record job creation, and we are now an oil exporter as a country ! He has only been in office for 2 short years but the country was in peril before him.

english - oh boy
french - oil of the nut of the coco
3173 2018-12-31 17:48:55 OiIwa?? Oil wa?? ???? what is that?
3174 2018-12-31 17:48:52 The only way for socialism to work is for oil refineries and Haliburton to have employee owned stocks. 

3175 2018-12-31 17:48:52 All oil  coming into our country should be held to the same standards and the countries should be forced to pay environmental taxes just like we do.
3176 2018-12-31 17:48:48 Fonz is just upset he can't oil himself up and sleep in the bath tub
3177 2018-12-31 17:48:48 Peter chiarelli is the Justin Trudeau of Hockey trying to stop Oil Production @EdmontonOilers #FireChia
3178 2018-12-31 17:48:40 The reason gas prices R low has nothing to do with DoFor & his PCs it has to do with global economy -prices have dropped because oil prices have dropped. Don’t let PCs take credit for something they had nothing to do with. PCs R lying to U & making false statements. Get educated
3179 2018-12-31 17:48:40 I swear Caribbean grandmothers are a different breed. I’ve been throwing up since 5 am. Drank sprite, sniffed peppermint oil, drank water, and took pepto and nothing was working. She gives me stomach tabs and now I’m fine.... wtf
3180 2018-12-31 17:48:38 What's the 401k balance of the average American? 75k? Maybe 100k?  How much did they lose with oil equities crapped out?
3181 2018-12-31 17:48:36 Walmart take 2 days for a oil change dawg
3182 2018-12-31 17:48:33 あまりにも眠すぎたので裏一さんとの通話を中断して寝ます おやすみ！
3183 2018-12-31 17:48:29 I’m having pizza and video games and cbd oil until it goes away
3184 2018-12-31 17:48:21 Coconut oil and eucalyptus essential oil
3185 2018-12-31 17:48:21 Hahaha, true. I reckon that explains Lemurian behavior w.r.t. cold. They freeze with the coconut oil.
3186 2018-12-31 17:48:20 Selalunya oily bhgian t zone shj saya selalu pakai jenis oil balancing punya product/dry skin product,jenama yang okay selalunya simple dan wardah, kalau boleh cari pencuci muka yg gel,bukan foam, foam lagi buat kulit muka kering plus potential nak berjerawat tu tinggi
3187 2018-12-31 17:48:08 Never rule out anything, especially in a game that as Graham put it in the short run acts as a voting mechanism vs long run weighing mechanism.

But the dollar spike theory is weakening with each day that the gold to oil ratio heads higher.
3188 2018-12-31 17:48:07 Well, good for those in Mutare. Where I live the price of bread doubled, public transport fares doubled, Mazoe doubled, car oil and accessories trippled but as a civil servant o am earning the same amount as 12 months ago.
3189 2018-12-31 17:48:05 Bio oil
3190 2018-12-31 17:47:56 Get a good French High Carbon Steel pan. Room temp steak. Salt and pepper 30 min before. Blot moisture, brush w/oil. Pan on high w/bacon grease. Steaks in, shake to loosen, turn once, when good sear put in oven till done. Wireless therm probe. Herb butter. Rest. Eat. Enjoy!
3191 2018-12-31 17:47:53 I really hate service and sales customers. They’re so rude and boujee like don’t talk me like you drive a fuckn Maserati bitching about a $44.95 oil change
3192 2018-12-31 17:47:48 One would hope CBD would now be the price of fish oil
3193 2018-12-31 17:47:47 A mad woman who squandered the oil resources of our country on the altar of monetarism. Plus incompetently getting engaged in a war which could have been avoided.
3194 2018-12-31 17:47:45 Here are my achievements of 2018: 
- Made the National Honor Band of America. 
- Got a contract with The Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps. 
- Got to travel to other places outside of Texas(:  
- Performed at Finals in Lucas Oil 
- Grew mentally and physically 

What are yours?
3195 2018-12-31 17:47:39 Then walk the walk and give up all your oil & gas products- fuel, natural gas, plastics, including your phone/computer before telling the rest of us what to do. Otherwise it’s just hypocrisy your pushing.
3196 2018-12-31 17:47:33 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes

Bush Dynasty oil profits
Clinton's profits 
Military equipment special interest and Washington insiders

In the grand scheme of things too many of our GIs gave the ultimate the price for above.

Enough!
3200 2018-12-31 17:47:11 Trump is the ultimate snake oil salesman...
3201 2018-12-31 17:47:05 Canada's oil imports are mainly from the US not from overseas. We need stricter regulations on all vessels. 

We don't need more tankers to either import of export oil. So no need for TransMountain as it would increase tanker traffic.
3202 2018-12-31 17:47:01 Yea, palm oil.
3203 2018-12-31 17:46:55 if you find better beard oil alert me
3204 2018-12-31 17:46:55 When you get your oil changed and your tires aired up/rotated it feels like driving a whole new car
3205 2018-12-31 17:46:33 I know Americans aren't acting like its not true. Yall have a president who puts kids in cages until they die yall not only a joke but your an evil nation who bomb innocents everyday in the middle east for oil
3206 2018-12-31 17:46:25 BS! She was STILL peddling this snake oil as of THIS YEAR!

3210 2018-12-31 17:46:05 Targeted Individuals: The guy who changed my oil told me of the strange things that have been happening since his divorce. He's been stalked, harassed, arrested and sent in for a mental eval. I said, "You are a TI." He said, "Yes, you are the first one I met who knows about it."
3211 2018-12-31 17:45:49 Boiled o. With garnished red oil

3214 2018-12-31 17:45:45 It’s haitian castor oil. Haitians believe is cures almost everything.

3216 2018-12-31 17:45:35 @marksandspencer nice puddings, still too much plastic & palm oil.  Many date/chocolate/fruit cartons can be of paper like egg boxes.
3217 2018-12-31 17:45:21 Oil is always an up and down industry. When it’s up, we brag and get cocky and buy lifted trucks and big toys and when it’s down we blame everyone else for our poor planning and putting all our eggs into one basket. It’s been this way for decades.
3218 2018-12-31 17:45:18 As Kevin Ware was lying on the court at Lucas Oil with his leg bone sticking out, he tweeted a link to his story about Ware being involved with Ken Caldwell and Brandon Bender. I took exception.

3225 2018-12-31 17:44:28 The oil leak on the other hand isn’t making a code come up either I suppose because it’s a very slow leak it’s just something I discovered when it was getting an oil change so either way the SRS diagnosis is going to cost roughly a $100 I spoke to them already
3226 2018-12-31 17:44:21 hi @bastilledan will we be hearing oil on water at any upcoming shows
3227 2018-12-31 17:44:10 But not surprisingly, it’s  the same disingenuous game we play with language to tell ourselves solar is ready to take over the energy market.

It’s worth working on, it could get there someday, but right now it’s not. And since the main policy being pushed is to punish oil...
3228 2018-12-31 17:44:08 Happy New Year 2019

3235 2018-12-31 17:43:36 Exxon = Esso = Standard Oil of New Jersey
Die haben schon die Nazi-Uboote auf hoher See aufgetankt und Öladditive für Deutschlands Panzer und Kriegsflugzeuge geliefert, ohne die die nicht hätten fahren/fliegen können.
Verantwortung haben die noch nie übernommen.

3237 2018-12-31 17:43:21 you ever just drop your oil pen 2 days after you buy it and waste all that money ? cus same
3238 2018-12-31 17:43:16 Which essential oil is best for getting people to stop talking to you?
3239 2018-12-31 17:43:15 Super, but this machine also reminds one what a vicious the fossil fuel cycle is, from the minute it is taken out of the ground ! Oil - plastic - oil - pollution galore!
3240 2018-12-31 17:42:58 #US stocks fluctuated in thin #trading on the final day of what is shaping up to be the #worst year since the financial crisis! #Treasuries slipped and #oil erased gains!
3241 2018-12-31 17:42:57 Anyone who tries to gain advantage by gaming the system pretending to be a minority is disgusting! Your apologists will say “but she was just young”. BS, you were still carrying on this snake oil as of 2018. And you’ve yet to apologize to the Native American community!
3242 2018-12-31 17:42:52 Getting Red’s oil changed at Rainbow. They are so much more reasonably priced than Jiffy Lube.
3243 2018-12-31 17:42:47 I hope the guys in Midnight Oil are having a fantastic 2019 so far.
3244 2018-12-31 17:42:37 @cchukudebelu Just Like China  on the Security Council made Darfur A Ward of Misery because they want Darfurian Oil.
3245 2018-12-31 17:42:34 My nails looks dead..I think I need to buy cuticles oil. Sigh
3246 2018-12-31 17:42:29 I feel like my hair has grown a lot in the last few weeks. Think it’s the Jamaican black castor oil.
3247 2018-12-31 17:42:14 It’s something thats apparently been going on for months though but I was for the SRS it’s gotta go to the dealership because whatever it is , is something that the dealer can tell me  and the oil leak isn’t making the car throw any codes either I suppose because it’s very slow.
3248 2018-12-31 17:42:11 Blaiq doesn’t use a recipe anymore.  He goes by feel now.  I do know that he uses a little more oil than most recipes call for.

3251 2018-12-31 17:41:26 Am I the only one who thinks the leaked jokes are fucking hilarious???
3252 2018-12-31 17:41:04 @SenSanders needs a @BetoORourke to excite the youth movement. In Texas oil and gas rules. Beto ran in west texas where oil rules. These were funds he raised in Congress 
When he ran for Senate he raised money same way @BernieSanders did small donations! So shut the fuck up ok!
3253 2018-12-31 17:41:03 sanders also got money from people who worked in the gas/oil industry.
3254 2018-12-31 17:41:00 The srs light requires a code reader that for SRS only a normal code reader won’t tell you anything I’ve tried it already and I did have the airbags tested with that particular special reader nothing comes up and the airbags pass as for the oil leak the car doesn’t have codes

3256 2018-12-31 17:40:45 Oil is dirt dirt cheap rightnow because our foundation is fraudulent currency  just wait what the price will be in a goldstandard when rich oil nations use the oil to mine it for themself
3257 2018-12-31 17:40:37 God will fill those empty, hurt parts of us with His love and healing oil. Let’s have open hands and let Him x
3258 2018-12-31 17:40:35 Republicans have allowed Trump to destroy our country because they wanted their tax cuts for the rich, deregulation for gas & oil industry + bonus harassment of brown people at the border. The GOP is complicit in everyway in Trump's mismanagement and his many crimes.
3259 2018-12-31 17:40:32 I have.  Canada's oil sector is vastly superior to other countries.  Nobody is disputing that.  It's still oil though, and it still contributes to climate change and other environmental destruction.  The choice between jobs and environmentalism is a false one.
3260 2018-12-31 17:40:31 Cap & Trade or its removal had nothing to do with lower gasoline prices, world oil prices are at very low prices. You're peddling a lie right on cue tweeting the same nonsense the rest of your caucus  is..like good little trained seals. #onpoli
3261 2018-12-31 17:40:27 We were making shrimp tacos on the stove.  Frying them up in a little oil. I took the girls' shrimp out but wanted to give mine some kick.  So I sprinkled Carolina Reaper powder into hot oil/shrimp.  We couldn't stop coughing for 20 minutes despite the house open and fans going.
3262 2018-12-31 17:40:17 I love olive oil! this is bad news :(
3263 2018-12-31 17:40:16 add oil, rice, salt. stir. Add water stir, let it cook.

It was (scapegoat) Natwarlal who was the beneficiary, Mr. Antony? उसे तो बली का बकरा बना दिया। Augusta Westland में किसे बनओगे? सावधान रहना, कभी आप ही न बन जाओ।
3268 2018-12-31 17:39:36 i’m getting an oil change , and the dude ask me what kinda oil did i want ... i said does it matter what type of oil you put in your car he gone say some “yea” WILL NIGGA WHAT TYPE I NEED ! you the mechanic
3269 2018-12-31 17:39:24 Oil lobbyist
3270 2018-12-31 17:39:20 Oh... after the egg and before the cheese you add the pancetta  too, with all the oil.
3271 2018-12-31 17:39:19 “Total Loss” says Peru fire about the morning blaze. Fire started in an oil burning furnace at Witczak Auto Supply. Details at Noon on 1430 WCMY.
3272 2018-12-31 17:39:12 I guess with no oil and gas people better start sharpening their axes.oh right cutting trees for heat is bad for environment....its back to igloos then
3273 2018-12-31 17:38:53 พี่จะแข็งแรง ไปพร้อมกับเอพิ้งค์เลยค่ะ  
สุขสมหวังทุุกประการนะเราอ่ะ...
3274 2018-12-31 17:38:47 It’s the food that has the oil in it
3275 2018-12-31 17:38:47 Maybe if the neighbourhood kids would stay off his lawn he wouldn't have to keep yelling at him. Also, there is a push on from think tanks friendly to Trump and the Saudis to blacken Khashoggi's name. It's the next step in normalizing the flow of oil, money and guns.
3276 2018-12-31 17:38:34 Need an oil change...need a NY outfit....decisions. Decisions.
3277 2018-12-31 17:38:21 For shampoo I use Aloxxi essential 7 oil cleansing shampoo, Aveda dry remedy conditioner, It's a 10 hair mask once a week, and Olaplex no. 3 treatment weekly too.
3278 2018-12-31 17:38:20 ค่ะ มีความสุขมากๆตลอดปี2019นะคะ
3279 2018-12-31 17:38:12 Turns out Louis CK was a charlatan peddling snake oil billed as an empathetic comedy. Guess he really is just an unforgivable piece of shit. Also, don't let his shit tier 4chan-esque "new material" eclipse what he did to his victims as a sexual predator.
3280 2018-12-31 17:38:12 Boiling oil poured from the top of the wall would be a nice touch, since you're going medieval here.
3281 2018-12-31 17:38:11 Walls don’t even work in pastures or gardens...so why do you think you need to sell us your snake  oil?
3282 2018-12-31 17:38:03 can i ask what your role is in terms of the service users you work with? if they are ill then its may not be the oil or the lack of fluoride that is causing bad breath
3283 2018-12-31 17:38:01 A Seat At The Table is like coconut oil and water in music form. Any time my energy feels off, I can play it and feels like I hit a reset button 
3284 2018-12-31 17:37:59 Ya celebrating new year abi , let the Chinese govt catch u 
3285 2018-12-31 17:37:52 ﾑﾘ…ﾏﾁﾞゴメン…（いま手元にswitchが無い）
3286 2018-12-31 17:37:36 Oil Money 
3287 2018-12-31 17:37:32 Then I suggest you read the science and compare Canadian oil to other countries and look at there environmental and employee rights records.
3288 2018-12-31 17:37:31 8/ ... shadow chancellor has, in the last few months, been in Scotland, promising the support of a future Labour govt for oil and gas, should concern anyone who is concerned about the environment. So much of this has the sense of old battles being re-fought, without awareness ...
3289 2018-12-31 17:37:30 ขอพรปีใหม่ให้พี่อาร์มีสุขภาพแข็งแรง
ปี2019ให้เฮงๆนะคะ

3291 2018-12-31 17:37:05 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
WTI's pullback is a pain in the neck for the bulls but it will be turned to a nice gain in the end.
3292 2018-12-31 17:37:00 Cast iron skillet and a little bit of butter and olive oil. Salt and pepper. Let it sit 10 minutes after its done.
3293 2018-12-31 17:36:54 あるるが強い
3294 2018-12-31 17:36:52 There undoubtedly a large part of that but if UK, France, Italy and USA hadn't decided to destroy Iraq, Libya, Syria How many efugees would there be. The USA is keen to get Iranian oil reserves, so there will be more from there.
3295 2018-12-31 17:36:41 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
3296 2018-12-31 17:36:32 Farm diesel down to 82.9 today. What is everyone else seeing? Thoughts on where it’s going? Oil may have hit bottom? #AgTwitter
3297 2018-12-31 17:36:28 Trump made a snake oil salesmen’s promise in 2016, better health care, better leadership, “what have you got to lose?”  In less than 2 years, everyone found out what that meant.  He can’t unring a bell, everyone knows who he is now.  He has a base, but it’s a minority.
3298 2018-12-31 17:36:25 Snake oil salesmen one notch below a politician TERM LIMITS
3299 2018-12-31 17:36:20 I just finished an oil painting I started in February. Oils are my favourite medium but damn are they hard to balance with a full time art job.
3300 2018-12-31 17:36:18 Naked? In hot oil?  I'm there for that.
3301 2018-12-31 17:36:10 Lying about being responsible for pump price drop, lying about price of oil....
Trudeau has strongest economic growth of G20 without giving tax cut to wealthiest. Polls show Jat trusted & respected in Canada & abroad. 
Yes, when you lie, you end up discredited just like Cho.
3302 2018-12-31 17:36:05 My ultimate Oil target is just below the 2016 low, so using the LT charts at the lower orange channel around 22-26
3303 2018-12-31 17:36:02 For example: If you ask it where the nearest place to get an oil change is, it should give you the location that works best for you. Not try to route you to a different place just because that other place buys sponsored ads from the vendor of the IA.
3304 2018-12-31 17:36:01 Well the idea is probably to have the USA military up to date and ready to face threats from China etc ...but, the Military will not be used for oil wars and wars of conquest like iraq etc ...
3305 2018-12-31 17:35:44 Fake news --> CNN
Failed Generals --> stupid people
Me --> Stable genius

Truth: The wars are for oil profits.
3306 2018-12-31 17:35:43 In the den of snakes, where else do you think he gets the oil?
3307 2018-12-31 17:35:41 Eucalyptus oil is great, too.
3308 2018-12-31 17:35:36 Lol
3309 2018-12-31 17:35:34 Also education is the only way to solve this gap. So is she proposing her presidential platform will have education reform? If so my fourth grade teacher in 2004 told me there was no oil in ND because it wasn’t in the book...
3310 2018-12-31 17:35:32 Aku bawak balik lahhhh yg tu tapi hg punya tea tree oil tu ada dalam almari aku amik la
3311 2018-12-31 17:35:27 Poor Lynsey, he bought Trumps snake oil..
3312 2018-12-31 17:35:26 I’d love to see oil head east to be refined and have energy independence in lieu of importing from overseas markets.  Also, demand for heavy oil is still needed in the Asian markets.
3313 2018-12-31 17:35:21 Didn’t realize that oil does not need to be boiling in order to be hot enough to make tempura, and filled my entire house with thick black smoke.
3314 2018-12-31 17:35:17 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
3315 2018-12-31 17:35:00 สวัสดีปีหม๊ายยยยย
3316 2018-12-31 17:34:49 But that’s what happens when u mix oil with water and heat it
3317 2018-12-31 17:34:42 HRC was, she was opposing the pipeline and the oil industry took out attack ads against her. I saw HRC talk about how she quietly helped women get out of Afghanistan and contacted different nations around the world to take them in when the Taliban was hunting them down in 90s.
3318 2018-12-31 17:34:24 His hair looks a bit like it’s been soaked in oil but I love it
3319 2018-12-31 17:34:20 THE BIBLE SAID ADAM AND EVE NOT TWO VERY HANDSOME SEXY HALF NAKED MACHINE MEN WHO STEALS ALL YOUR VISCOUS OIL AND CALL YOU TO DIE
3320 2018-12-31 17:34:18 $86 was in Oct. you need to also add the Rs5 decrease provided last month by government. Total decrease is about Rs10. Also try to present correct figures, Brent oil is currently $54 and not $48

3326 2018-12-31 17:34:04 U R ending 2018 on a silly note. Oil CEOs are indeed embracing CO2 pricing. Y?  To moderate liability when the inevitable climate lawsuits start up.  There is no real defence in environmental litigation, other than due diligence and compliance.  U must be smarter in 2019
3327 2018-12-31 17:34:01 え、赤白のジャージとはもしや、、、
3328 2018-12-31 17:33:58 Try Kwan Loong oil (available on Amazon). It’s like peppermint oil on steroids.
3329 2018-12-31 17:33:42 Happy New Year 2019 สวัสดีปีใหม่ค่ะ ~ 
3330 2018-12-31 17:33:36 Really just paid for my first oil change, and I’ll never do it again.
3331 2018-12-31 17:33:22 Thank you. I have so little patience to explain “No, the disabled kid and the oil exec don’t deserve the same level of abuse because you’re ‘equal opportunity.’”
3332 2018-12-31 17:33:20 This is the first time I'm thinking about paying for my oil change.... but nahhhh

3335 2018-12-31 17:33:09 Trump is in a position to pour oil on troubled waters, but instead revels in hatred and division. Soulless wretch!

3339 2018-12-31 17:32:32 Hey @Avis just rented a car from you to drive to see friends in VA. The vehicle couldn’t have been more busted!! Check engine light was on due to needing oil change, had a broken trunk gate that wouldn’t close and beeped the whole ride, cracked windshield, broken rear seat etc..
3340 2018-12-31 17:32:29 I'm new in the game 
3341 2018-12-31 17:32:29 As five black oil engineering student came back and returned to GSB(Rhianna's biggest glory hole that ever lived) and nobody wanted to see to it that in the lady's room at the GSB nobody was better and yet Rhianna made a very good point and it was talked about for many salient
3342 2018-12-31 17:32:25 Yep, He wants that wall so he can have the "boarder" patrol pour boiling oil over the top.
3343 2018-12-31 17:32:22 INCORPORATE HEALTHIER FOOD OPTIONS INTO OUR DIET 
You don't have to start eating only green vegetables and give up pizza and burgers. Take baby steps by drinking green smoothies now and then, eat more fruit and nuts, bake your food instead of frying it in oil.
3344 2018-12-31 17:32:22 How should I jerkoff on this last day of the year? 

Vaseline or Coconut Oil?
FaceTime or alone?
3345 2018-12-31 17:32:22 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
3346 2018-12-31 17:32:05 And if you want to rub it around and/or protect your skin if the oil irritates, put a few drops in some glycerin, either regular or vegan. You can get the first any drug store; vegan at health stores or online.
3347 2018-12-31 17:32:01 Must be a sly reference to the oil embargo. Or maybe they think Israeli falafel is too oily. They should really complain about Egyptian falafel though, that stuff is practically oil balls.
3348 2018-12-31 17:31:59 #Environmental: Address Oil Spills in Gulf states; TX & LA. Factory explosions in surrounding Houston areas. Neighborhood environment issues.

3349 2018-12-31 17:31:55 You lie about everything and wonder why people don’t trust you. You are a snake oil salesman who really never learned any charm.
3350 2018-12-31 17:31:52 I did this in clip Studio and used the oil paint brush and the blending tool!
3351 2018-12-31 17:31:47 I just spent $300 on fucking oil!!!! I’m so over it. Converting this damn heater Asap!!!!!

3354 2018-12-31 17:31:30 I want and need to do a oil change on my car but its kinda cold and I've been lazy
3355 2018-12-31 17:31:29 I'm sending my thoughts and prayers because... I'm in Alberta. That's about all I can do from here.

Well, I could send some oil and natural gas as well to keep you warm. Would that help?
3356 2018-12-31 17:31:27 ( ˘ω˘ ) ｽﾔｧ…
3357 2018-12-31 17:31:27 のんさんとお会いしたので、にゃんさんによろしくお伝え下さいとご挨拶しておきました。
3358 2018-12-31 17:31:24 Yes there is that as well. Also no outrage towards pollution from oil imports (Saudi, Nigeria, US) or coal exports to China and India.

Seems inconsistent and hypocritical eh
3359 2018-12-31 17:31:14 Brian! Were gonna go outside and look at the car engine oil levels! See Brian she's doing fine now let's go outside quick before she asks for something oh turn off the ringers on the phones we dont want her disturbed  = 411 0 (Reverse Full Reduction)

3362 2018-12-31 17:31:00 It's not very healthy, unfortunately. All that breading and oil. And I like lots of tartar sauce!
3363 2018-12-31 17:30:43 Boy if u don’t get your oil changed lol
3364 2018-12-31 17:30:34 I use an oil radiator which is slower by far but makes me less of a dried sponge
3365 2018-12-31 17:30:32 Brilliant strategy - assuming it's still 1998.

BC can't even give away access to its natural gas.  Alberta's heavy, expensive oil is next to worthless which is why royalties are nearly zero.  Alberta gave away 80% of its wealth to big oil 20 years ago.

3374 2018-12-31 17:29:54 I am looking forward to this massive year. Hopefully that will be a turnaround point in my life. 
3375 2018-12-31 17:29:43 The same way all snake oil salesman sleep.  Just fine
3376 2018-12-31 17:29:39 Canada has the most environmentally responsible oil and gas operations in the world. Generalizing is counterproductive
3377 2018-12-31 17:29:36 Reactionary Democrats would rather have an Orange clown separating families at the border and oil in our water ways than pay their fair share for an equitable cooperative society.
3378 2018-12-31 17:29:33 I been trying to get this oil change for the last week. Should I do it today? 10 likes and I’ll go
3379 2018-12-31 17:29:33 Wonder what the 'special' part of that 1600E is? Maybe it was a deluxe with some wood capping thrown in for good measure. Or it had a chrome pancake filter and a Peco rear box . +1 for the fizz. Autolube I hope 'cos I seized one solid back in '78 due to wrong oil ratio 
3380 2018-12-31 17:29:32 That point of view is fallacious because if we check there was an oil boom from the early 2000's down to at least 2011 then the Great Depression hit which saw the reduction in the price of crude and increase in inflation, so PDP had a more lucrative economy to work with tbh.
3381 2018-12-31 17:29:31 sana oil hahaha
3382 2018-12-31 17:29:27 Eucalyptus oil works as well!
3383 2018-12-31 17:29:25 Oil prices slip and set for annual drop in three years and this is breaking news today in international buisness news
3384 2018-12-31 17:29:03 Dude it is common knowledge that oil is not from fossils.  Get with the times grandpa!
3385 2018-12-31 17:29:00 Alaskans own 39,225 shares of BAKER HUGHES INC, worth $2,346,440. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in UNITED STATES.
3386 2018-12-31 17:28:57 This development is amazing, as it opens the doorway to another source of clean burning energy. As scientists make more and more of these discoveries, it is likely that one will replace oil and gasoline as the main providers for energy.
3387 2018-12-31 17:28:56 Yesss castor oil and walk
3388 2018-12-31 17:28:53 Also tbt to when you judged me for using so much chili oil and now u too are a whore for chili oil

3390 2018-12-31 17:28:47 Climate Change is a HUGE WIN for Putin as it eliminates his competition on the oil market
3391 2018-12-31 17:28:43 Before we play video games all day I have to pretend to be an Adult and go get my oil changed and tires rotated. Then imma pick up some food on the way home. Then it’s #Destiny2 grind time

3396 2018-12-31 17:28:31 I’d love to see Canada continue to refine for domestic consumption but refine CANADIAN oil, not imported oil from other markets.   Environmentalists turn a blind eye to the fact that most of our oil is produced un-ethically and transported overseas to our refineries.

3411 2018-12-31 17:26:52 Doesnt matter if everyone avoids palm oil, they will just start harvesting an oil under a different name maybe with a "hey its better than palm" approach, but in reality it not being better. We dont need to boycott palm, we need to push for sustainability. Palm yields most anyway
3412 2018-12-31 17:26:46 happy new years
3413 2018-12-31 17:26:45 Castor oil help fr drink some at 38 weeks it instantly put my sister into labor it’s not dangerous they just say that bc they want you to wait to 40 weeks . And castor oil is gonna make you poop a lot which is what happens before labor it’s like your body cleanses itself

3416 2018-12-31 17:26:36 Fuel Oil and Kerosene Sales: (Mon, 31 Dec 2018) The U.S. Energy Information Administration released… @environmentguru
3417 2018-12-31 17:26:31 And oil's rise follows gold's, right, at ~15/1 ratio? That would mean $85 oil today.
3418 2018-12-31 17:26:30 My skin is so fucking sensitive i cant even use cleansing oil now bcs of fungal acne aka tiny bums on forehead 
3419 2018-12-31 17:26:29 my body doesn’t produce a lick of oil or moisture
3420 2018-12-31 17:26:26 Idiots, has nothing to do with cap and trade, but rather the glut of oil on the market. You know, supply and demand.
3421 2018-12-31 17:26:22 No! I mean i never draw. AT ALL. But i really, really love art esp oil paintings and water color. Haha i love looking at them. I think they are the most beautiful.  AND HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!! 
3422 2018-12-31 17:26:22 Ronald Reagan is going to be in Avengers: Endgame
3423 2018-12-31 17:26:00 I don't agree with you. International oil prices are major market movers. Oil prices have almost dropped to half, will give huge relief to BOP & we'll reduced budget deficit due to austerity plans and higher taxes. Infation & Interest rate to drop. Good for stock market #Pakistan
3424 2018-12-31 17:25:47 There has been some limited reaction from Middle Eastern govt's in the past to China's treatment of Muslims. 
But several of those governments also want to participate in BRI, sell oil to China, and otherwise have good relations with Beijing.
3425 2018-12-31 17:25:44 What a pathetic government , crude oil at its lowest 45 per barrel and government just reducing petrol of 4Rs, what a joke . Mind it during noon tenure it was 55 per Barrel and petrol price was around 70 . No justification ....
3426 2018-12-31 17:25:27 おめでとうございます
3427 2018-12-31 17:25:19 2019....

Buy: Uranium leadership 
Wait: PMs cash flowing mid tiers & cheeky small caps
Watch: Natural gas/Offshore oil services & OSVs. Rebound?
Short: Broad market roll over- FAANGs, Boeing and anything not nailed down. Recession incoming. 

Happy New Year!
3428 2018-12-31 17:25:14 On a level playing field yes. But the corruption and malfeasance of the Oil, Coal and Gas industries keeps shoving toxic carbon down the throats of our children.
3429 2018-12-31 17:24:59 We in the East decided we didnt want dirty oil or gas coming through here.
Northern pipeline would kill the env ironment.
These points are not all factual .

3434 2018-12-31 17:24:31 Oil takes cad down. 
Oil dropped 100 pips. That is why usdcad was up a bit. 
It's coming down. Sell it. 
Be wise and safe

3436 2018-12-31 17:24:13 So there’s a Tom Ford shimmering body oil set with two 45 mL bottles but it’s the same price as the 100 mL but I really want the set just because it comes in a cute box.

3440 2018-12-31 17:23:26 Phase out the use of fossil fuels over the next decade by law and liquidate the assets of the oil & gas industries to pay for the necessary clean up their employees should be forced to do.
3441 2018-12-31 17:23:14 olive oil
3442 2018-12-31 17:23:11 I always fuck them up by not allowing myself enough time to cook them. So I’ve started cooking them right away with my breakfast on low heat and I don’t skimp on oil. Mine still never look like restaurant ones tho and I think it’s bc I don’t have a griddle just lil pans
3443 2018-12-31 17:22:59 PDP emptied and shared ECA meant for raining day and reserve depleted to $24bn for $120 per barrel 16yrs, @MBuhari APC 3yrs we having $43bn despite oil $50 per barrel. 
We build on sth not on nothing so PDP is in history PMB2023 to retired/change corrupt politicians. #Youth's2023
3444 2018-12-31 17:22:57 But capitalism is an abstract concept that many people are not intellectually capable of grasping. By contrast, the value of oil and gas is directly perceivable to any adult with a normal, functioning brain.

3446 2018-12-31 17:22:46 That rock could’ve been covered in flaming oil with broken glass at the bottom and You still would have looked at me and said “we’re climbing this right” and I would’ve said “Yup!” 
3447 2018-12-31 17:22:36 Tip I discovered for those of us who can’t (or choose not to) take decongestants: rub peppermint oil on and below your nose periodically. It’s amazingly effective. (Works the same way Vick’s Vapor does, only without the petrochemical component.)
3448 2018-12-31 17:22:27 International oil market has decreased 40%
Atleast Rs.25 should have been decreased even at the current tax rates

3449 2018-12-31 17:22:27 Mr @georgesoros The US maintains chaos and destruction in Venezuela for its great oil potential to favor its members of the Persian Gulf who earn more than one hundred billion dollars annually with this situation
3450 2018-12-31 17:22:24 You must be putting some weed in your gochujang! I like Ford, but his policies likely only reduced gas prices by five cents. The majority of the reduction is due to a surplus of world oil , plus switching to winter gas.  Don't you read about the international petrol industry?
3451 2018-12-31 17:22:21 Oil and water.
3452 2018-12-31 17:22:17 Make sure its not honey & olive oil

3463 2018-12-31 17:21:30 But I don’t like coconut oil...
3464 2018-12-31 17:21:29 I stand corrected although it is very ambiguous at best here in the UK 
 5 years ago I traced a company in Edinburgh who issued the certificates & at that time I wasn't given any further information...
I still refuse to purchase any products that contain Shea Fat or the Oil..
3465 2018-12-31 17:21:28 And? The soy is being grown to feed cattle, make vegetable oil and to export to China. White vegan demand for tofu does not come play.
3466 2018-12-31 17:21:19 The same way your cheating, lying hypocritical snake oil Mitch McConnell does. Tell me again how Mitch stealing Supreme Court seats and not supporting or obstructing for 8 years sleeps.

3470 2018-12-31 17:21:06 Carbon is a greenhouse gas. We've dumped massive amounts into the atmosphere. Even before they started their denial PR campaigns, the oil companies knew it. The results are already being felt, and will be catastrophic. The adults will try fix it, just get out of the way.
3471 2018-12-31 17:20:56 Check your facts.  When I checked, it looked like New Brunswick was the only province with appreciable amounts of oil from outside the continent.
3472 2018-12-31 17:20:53 With oil? Or your
3473 2018-12-31 17:20:51 that awkward moment when you buy a comodo cert in 2018 so now you have to get another cert from elsewhere because it’s untrusted in every major browser. sup, @comododesktop, how’s your claims of your AV blocking all possible malware, 0days, and APT? people still buying snake oil?

Dear WH Occupant,

The American people would like to know, how anyone who conveniently "forgot" to bill Saudi Arabia $500 Billion for oil, is in ANY position to prolong a #TrumpShutdown?
3476 2018-12-31 17:20:42 Gold can easily be repriced by the market to account for the money.

Central banks are buyers and not sellers of gold for a reason.  Gold (and oil) are the poker chips governments accumulate to bargain with if there is a currency crisis.
3477 2018-12-31 17:20:41 You selling beard oil or something?
3478 2018-12-31 17:20:25 HNY นะทุกคนนนนน

3480 2018-12-31 17:20:23 Why has coconut oil nearly set my microwave on fire 
3481 2018-12-31 17:19:58 Oregano oil. Sorry to hear you're getting sick before your birthday. I have been sick since Friday. I feel your pain
3482 2018-12-31 17:19:43 i believe that’s why he has certain ones in a brown bottle versus clear. it’s an oil.
3483 2018-12-31 17:19:40 Group hug with oil lobbyists?
“Oh! And how did all this money get in my pockets?”
3484 2018-12-31 17:19:30 Tell him to look into cannabis oil during his recuperation.  It's got some heavy reparative properties for after injuries like that, including brain injuries!  If all you can find is CBD oil, or "Charlotte's Web" oil, that'll also provide some benefits.
3485 2018-12-31 17:19:28 I've been saying for a while now that oil assets need to be seized. In the end it will be done as a desperate panic measure but too late to make any difference.
3486 2018-12-31 17:19:25 She never did, that was me doing my own thing. I have not seen any tweets from you about oil until recently but not sure which direction you see it going. I saw the low of $37 tweet for wti but then saw EK tweet good for a long until Feb. So I am a little confused. Thanks!
3487 2018-12-31 17:19:25 Hell ive Got some Cannabis~Oil Left in the Canister might as Well Wake And Bake to Get the Day Started...

3492 2018-12-31 17:19:16 How are you and your kind enjoying your Saudi Arabian oil? When Alberta separates cutting thedge country in three you will know you have played a prominent role, good ridden to you and your henchman
3493 2018-12-31 17:19:07 You sound like a sleazy car salesman, or snake oil salesman.

3498 2018-12-31 17:18:45 That chittering sounds like it could be the oil heating up. We recommend checking the connection point from time to time incase there is leakage from cartridge.

3501 2018-12-31 17:18:30 They are defending their own profiteering. Tillerson was mixed up in a deal to exploit oil in the Russian part of the Arctic Ocean... and Trump... well, we need say no more. Is there any better definition of treachery?

3506 2018-12-31 17:18:15 The cap and trade tax in Ontario amounted to at least 4cents a litre. Yes, the reminder of the drop is related to oil prices. Why is this so difficult for ppl to understand.
3507 2018-12-31 17:18:12 Can’t wait till I’m 20 so I can go work in the oil rigs like my brother
3508 2018-12-31 17:18:02 Bernie Sanders tweeted that big oil is akin to big Tobacco in causing deaths etc.  Oil is of course big in Texas. What Democratic potential candidate hails from Texas ?
3509 2018-12-31 17:17:46 Sorry to ask more questions, I've been offered THC/cbd capsules, I'm trying to save myself cash by getting all advice, ie the capsules may not be satisfactory to do the job, does oil have same flavours as dry herb vaping, the vape chamber on my portable takes lot of bud lol
3510 2018-12-31 17:17:43 The only ones who are against the carbon tax are, oil and gas companies, the politicians who are paid by them, and billion dollar companies who pollute a lot. Oh... and those that have actually been duped. 

I mean, who are you gonna believe on this?
3511 2018-12-31 17:17:17 One saving thing for diesel is a slow down in US oil production reduces demand
3512 2018-12-31 17:17:03 Eat proteins , it helps build white blood cells which is what fights sickness - peppermint tea (anything with peppermint oil/extract) peppermint is like any antibiotic for viruses - homemade chicken soup has healing qualities - plenty of vitamin C - REST/SLEEP - lotz of water

3526 2018-12-31 17:15:05 UK waters some parts already laid waste to overfishing & deep trawling. Then add the North Sea oil rig pollution & pollution from shipping, plastic, sewage. The seas around Britain will be poisoned & lifeless.

3528 2018-12-31 17:14:51 Things we need to do in 2019:
1. Fight back against the American campaign to kill our oil industry
2. Stop letting a small group of whiny pussies rule the world
3. Stop electing stupid people
4. Stop electing people who are "good enough"
3529 2018-12-31 17:14:51 They already built the pipeline and poisoned the water with oil leaks now. Little late.

Deanna Troi: The unchecked use of coal and oil back then contributed to climate change. Now on Earth it's never cold outside.
3532 2018-12-31 17:14:36 Still down the veg village food rabbit hole.
Have lots of ideas to try (but with less oil )
3533 2018-12-31 17:14:35 sis the air fryer is supposed to remove the oil out of your food thats what she means!! u can see how much oil comes out of your food that should've stayed in there otherwise!
3534 2018-12-31 17:14:30 I use an olive oil spray to spritz, but once they are charged you don't always need to refresh them. No soaking or any if that jazz and the oil protects my blades. Wins all round.
3535 2018-12-31 17:14:21 Not me but my favorite thing: 1 roommate made a huge amount of weed oil for cooking, then one day my other roommate and I were making dinner, I asked him to grab some oil, he pulls the weed oil out, I say "no, that's weed" and he says "what!? I've been using this for months!"

3540 2018-12-31 17:14:14 Looks like I'm moving onto oil now then lol, I'll miss those days of clearing my grinder out of THC crystal but smoking has to go, it will give me chance at least to introduce more CBD, most bud I smoke is high THC hardly any if at all CBD
3541 2018-12-31 17:14:07 I use a cast iron skillet to cook my steaks. I use a little bit of olive oil in the pan. Works great. As far as time goes, it depends on how you like your steak, and how thick of a cut you have. I start with about 5 minutes per side on medium high heat.
3542 2018-12-31 17:14:07 Many restaurants around here have fish fries on Fridays. All you can eat for a set price. $10.99 or similar. Breaded cod fillets, usually. Served with fries or potato chips. Some are good; some don't change their oil often enough.
3543 2018-12-31 17:14:04 Aye Dave the rich country would come crawling back.
Not a single one of the POOR countries to leave UK union ever came back,not a single one!

They have taken 92% of oil revenues for 50 years ffs ?

3546 2018-12-31 17:13:56 A colleague points out that if we were funded by the coal and oil lobby we'd have a much slicker operation (next you'll be saying you don't appreciate our puns). Either way it'll be cold comfort on a hot dead planet to say "ah but at least it wasn't the fossil fuels"
3547 2018-12-31 17:13:41 Who needs champagne this New Years when you can drink motor oil like all the cool kids.
3548 2018-12-31 17:13:28 That’s right, he has no conscience whatsoever as he drags the reputations of true snake oil salesmen in the mud.
3549 2018-12-31 17:13:22 Need more squirrel oil
3550 2018-12-31 17:13:16 Ask groundnut oil
3551 2018-12-31 17:13:03 Responsible? Hardly..it’s all about $$ and a big FU to the people our oil industries serve.
3552 2018-12-31 17:13:01 David thinks it's only OK for oil execs and rich people.
A PAC for working class people like a nurses union? 
David can't have that.
3553 2018-12-31 17:12:55 wish had someone to oil massage my scalp for me bc i don’t feel like it.
3554 2018-12-31 17:12:35 Hey费天王 I am your big fan in China ,I love tennis because of you though I am not very good at ,and I just watched your competition with Nadal in 2017,its so nice and exciting,almostly drives me crazy,so happy to see your twitter and see your smile,hope your next game！Add oil
3555 2018-12-31 17:12:07 You are like a donkey, once you get filled you start attacking who fed you for many years.
3556 2018-12-31 17:12:07 ingay talaga ni baby oil
3557 2018-12-31 17:11:52 Which tweet did she say go long oil at 50?
3558 2018-12-31 17:11:48 0-1 Sunday. Another loss of 3 units on #3tomake6 This brings total profits down to +36.41 units. Thinking I may have to change name to #3tolose3  
Risking 1 unit on each of the following 

Preds/Caps U6 -103
Jets/Oil U6 +104
Sharks/Flames U6 +106

3563 2018-12-31 17:11:24 Bro I ain’t changing shit about me in 2019. Only thing I’m changing is my oil.
3564 2018-12-31 17:11:06 My iPod might die in the 40 minutes it takes for my oil to get changed but I rly hope it doesn’t
3565 2018-12-31 17:11:05 13 degrees north & south actually. Since this includes tropical rainforests, we at Orangutan Land Trust have been working to ensure that sustainable production of palm oil is deforestation-free. As an orangutan conservationist, I have been working on the issue for about 15 years.

3569 2018-12-31 17:10:31 Relative to rivals? Sorry what? They all have oil money yet we can't have a cash injection due to FFP, What a load of bollocks, football is really fucking me off at the minute, one rule for one and one rule for anyone who isn't Arsenal

Oil prices slipped 1 percent on the final day of the year, en route for their first annual drop in three years as fears of a slowing global economy and emerging supply glut outweighed impending production cuts fro…

3580 2018-12-31 17:10:02 Seriously? The tweets were about people in the oil/gas industry donating to Beto. Sirota seem to be upset that. These were worker who did the donating. He seemed to be saying that certain jobs were not good enough to donate and be accepted if you are liberal. I'm done.
3581 2018-12-31 17:10:01 sana oil
3582 2018-12-31 17:09:54 the ppl who treat their bawdy terribly are the same ppl who shit on healthy food, healthy oil smells, healthy activities and healthy choices. coming at me with “that oil shit stinks!”, baby ur tryna tell me that while ur breath smells like cigarettes and red bull

3586 2018-12-31 17:09:28 An unspoken effect of the #GreenNewDeal? It severely reduces corruption.

The fossil fuel industry has taken over our government in the name of oil & environmental destruction. Bought & paid for reps allow it to go on.

A Green New Deal takes them out of the picture.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3587 2018-12-31 17:09:28 If you avoid putting on moisturizer, your face will start to dry out even if it’s already oily so then it produces more oil to try and combat the dryness! Though it seems counterproductive, moisturizer is never a step you wanna skip! :)
3588 2018-12-31 17:09:18 Nice joke Oil
3589 2018-12-31 17:09:09 Happy New Year 2019 น้าาา ,,,

Stick to the homer ‘reporting’ - the last thing Oil fans need is some guy from Calgary diagnosing.

3594 2018-12-31 17:08:37 You’re missing the point Brett.  No one questions the advantages of using Canadian oil instead of foreign oil.  The point is to reduce overall reliance on oil and fossil fuels and to reduce global warming.

3600 2018-12-31 17:08:11 Back on 2-Jan Brent Oil was at $66.65 while Diesel in Mumbai was Rs. 63.43. End Dec-18 Brent Oil is at $53 and Diesel in Mumbai at Rs. 66. While Oil is 20% cheaper, Diesel is up 5%. This after Rs. 5 (2.5 +2.5) duty cut in Oct. Perhaps Moving Avg. But Really??
3601 2018-12-31 17:08:08 Oil is very useful, it's weird that I can "feel" the difference it does more now that I am older; my hands and my face definitely feel better as well as my underarm ridges and the back of my knees and feet ... ... ...

3610 2018-12-31 17:07:22 I have been following your tweets on oil and I am confused with the direction you see in oil. Got beat up pretty bad trying to go long oil at $50. Any guidance you could give is much appreciated. Thanks!
3611 2018-12-31 17:07:06 It will be interesting to see the Trudeau response to Reconciliation if it involves the shipment of oil products.
3612 2018-12-31 17:07:03 meanwhile my hair is dry i can put a whole bucket of oil in it and it will suck it up immediately
3613 2018-12-31 17:06:59 Next to oil rig? 
3614 2018-12-31 17:06:57 My brother we may pray for you, fast for you,anoint you with 20litres of oil but if you don't go out there to find her angels won't bring her for you...Go find her and marry...

3635 2018-12-31 17:05:26 I believe everyone should do their best to avoid it. I try my best to avoid palm oil, but it’s not always easy nor realistic for a few reasons. But when I can, yes I avoid it.
3636 2018-12-31 17:05:23 Yes...& rig count suggests (IMO) that shale sector is still delivering against hedges.  Give $45 oil a few months & things will likely get rapidly worse.

3639 2018-12-31 17:05:13 So glad my uncle changed my oil for me 
3640 2018-12-31 17:05:10 Can't have corn without oil and natural gas. Or, it's just a continuation of agriculture getting the hind-teat (trade, RFS, and I believe Secy of Ag last cabinet member nominated and 2nd to last confirmed).
3641 2018-12-31 17:05:03 Neither does mine! Depending on what food I am cooking, I think there is sometimes natural oil that drips off and you can see it in the bottom of the pan when I’m done cooking.
3642 2018-12-31 17:04:54 For a cold, weight loss? Everything in between? I like that it looks like it’s meant to do in a shot! Reg Apple cider goes on Nonno’s salad  I just can’t drink it! I need the romaine & smuggled in olive oil hahaa

Yum. No carbs. No problem.
3645 2018-12-31 17:04:39 It was due to drastically downfall in crude oil prices.
Nothing to do with election.
3646 2018-12-31 17:04:28 Glad to hear it helps a bit. Sounds like you need a bigger dose of cbd. If you go to a shop they’ve got tons of different cbd items such as gummies, bath bombs, coffee, and larger strength oil. How many mgs is the oil you’re taking?

3649 2018-12-31 17:04:20 I think she's conflated those. Our RFS is based on making the US free of foreign oil (fool's errand).
3650 2018-12-31 17:04:17 I don’t take decongestants because they make my heart race. I just use peppermint oil.
3651 2018-12-31 17:04:16 Oh wow that is awesome, but might want to try coconut oil or milk though, or almond milk. Canola oil is actually really harmful to your health. Soy milk too.

3654 2018-12-31 17:03:44 I just picked up a suitably straight branch of about the right length, sawed narrow bottom & all side shoots off, de-barked it, & gave it sandpaper & a lot of linseed oil. 1969, now I come to think of it. Year before O-Levels, we performed scenes to the school for some reason.

3656 2018-12-31 17:03:34 Conservatism and Populism are like oil and water. Hard to be both and why the party has become. Folks like Graham try to walk the line but it is so blatantly transparent so as to be comical.
3657 2018-12-31 17:03:33 More. Avoiding regulation AND the intent of regulation. E .g. 'Clean Development Mechanism' is agreement with petroleum companies & govnmnts to enable extraction & processing of oil, cleanly & benefitting local people but see the polluted dirt poor lives of Niger Delta, Nigeria.
3658 2018-12-31 17:03:32 Sana oil! 
3659 2018-12-31 17:03:29 Hot Rock/Fondue are always fun. That way everyone can have exactly what they want. Cheese fondue to start, mains on the rock or oil fondue and then a chocolate fondue for dessert. Perfect!

3667 2018-12-31 17:01:40 You do understand that her opposition to Canadian oil makes her a shill for the US, Nigeria, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, etc, yes?
3668 2018-12-31 17:01:35 & if ne1 cared about the poverty in coal areas they would have encouraged a move to clean energy, but their oil paymasters would have disapproved.

3687 2018-12-31 17:00:11 I mean, is it possible that gas prices are TOO LOW!? People in the oil industry are suffering and you want to pay even less for the results of their labour??? The carbon tax in AB can make it so the govt can help them when the bottom drops out like it has recently.
3688 2018-12-31 17:00:05 Dead old woman oil Wouldn’t even nibble the edge of a chip fried it
3689 2018-12-31 17:00:03 What about all of the non oil and gas jobs that are gone.  You liberals always forget about those because that convicts your damned heroes.  Every province the NDP have ever run, the jobs vanish and the economy in that province tanks no matter what the rest of world is doing.
3690 2018-12-31 16:59:56 了解行きますぜ(^^)
3691 2018-12-31 16:59:52 Still waiting on that Great Ape and deforestation palm oil episode
3692 2018-12-31 16:59:50 Oil de ur head
3693 2018-12-31 16:59:35 Bro uses it. Really likes it. He also buys buds that have had the thc bred out of them and higher cbd content. Said he is a big fan. I want to get some oil for my frenchie since he has epilepsy. Curious to see if it helps him. You ever tried it?
3694 2018-12-31 16:59:33 I wonder what kind of oil they putting inside my car for it to take this LONG
3695 2018-12-31 16:59:26 @SonicAutomotive so I just found out the first free oil change in a car expires after a year oh and oil change is now $87??  Happy New Year. Next time I will take my business somewhere else.
3696 2018-12-31 16:59:21 In all honesty man, it gets tiring after awhile. With that said, his words certainly carry more weight than any of us who blog and wrote it X amount of times.
3697 2018-12-31 16:59:20 He told her ass next time Yu wanna have a baby hy that nigga *throws condoms wrap that shit up...oh and give me my gun back bitch...the oil tap in the back send me six feet under
3698 2018-12-31 16:59:19 My god you sound more and more like Donald Trump every day.

These prices have nothing to do with you and everything to do with world oil prices dropping.

Stop taking credit for something you have no control over.

3701 2018-12-31 16:59:10 what about something to do with Thomas Edisons son who used his fathers name to sell snake oil products, it became so bad that his father had to take him to court?
3702 2018-12-31 16:59:08 One shocking thing I found out in 2018 is that ladies (girlfriends and wives) nowadays use oil or margarine while making ugali. I'm still beyond dismayed! Abomination!

3706 2018-12-31 16:58:28 You’d have to do research on ingredients, I’m bad w/ that. I know there’s no animal testing which I love. They have tons of different products, maybe look up some reviews first? Tea tree cleanser is great for a deep clean but it can be drying. Tea tree oil is great for blemishes

3708 2018-12-31 16:58:21 Stop babying oil companies and the Nigerian oil industry as a whole. They’re are one of the major causes of pollution in Nigeria, especially in the Niger delta region. The present Legislations have weak laws and sanctions protecting the env from crude oil pollution.

3711 2018-12-31 16:58:10 just let a spainish lady put oil and ‘magic healing’ crystals on my back and I honestly never want to get that intimate with a woman again
3712 2018-12-31 16:58:03 Not sure if it would translate, but for coconut I have toasted slowly on low temp, put in paper bag to cool, shake occasionally, bag absorbs oil, back in oven, bag, oven, etc until it reaches toast level. Time consuming 4 sure but seemed to work as I got good foam on the beer.
3713 2018-12-31 16:57:58 I asked God this one thing: as my wick burns under the constant supply of His oil, that my life illuminates the path for many to find Him.

3722 2018-12-31 16:56:49 Since Oct'18 Crude Oil from the high of almost $77 to $42.50 on 1st Dec'18. Almost $25 cheaper than what it was. We want to know how this PKR 4.26 has been worked out? What about the fuel subsidiary in the electricity tarrif?

i said he may be able to give some of Azerbaijan oil money to children as you see in the pic :)))
3730 2018-12-31 16:56:13 Some are it’s the tax revenue that makes Scotland a rich country as we have have a small population in an independent Scotland all those taxes would go to Edinburgh not London - and owners of oil fields will be told that they have to put in a bit extra to Scotland same as Norway

3736 2018-12-31 16:55:46 The influence of 5G on the weather is so low that it is not worth mentioning. This campaign is just an attempt by the coal and oil lobby to secure business and further eradicate humanity with CO2.
3737 2018-12-31 16:55:45 I found, if I caught them early enough, a metric fucktonne of coconut oil mixed with a bit of lavender & tea tree essential oils got rid of most of them. Smells nicer than Hedrin anyway

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said on Monday they plan to upgrade their speed boats in the Gulf with radar-evading stealth technology and new missile launchers as tensions rise between Tehran and Washington in the vital oil shipping route.

3742 2018-12-31 16:55:29 I lost a job I worked at for 6 1/2 years, My mustang broke down because of a guy didn’t put oil in my car. I was without a legit job for 2 months.. but My faith in God fixed all of that
3743 2018-12-31 16:55:04 Not the same at all. As difficult and challenging it may be to keep all provinces together; tfe benefits far outweigh the negatives. Have you seen a list? Any point in time ignoring that the price of oil is $40 a barrel rather than $100.
3744 2018-12-31 16:55:01 @EngdahlFW I follow your writings, I can't believe you wrote the last one re peak oil. Peak oil refers to dirtier, expensive, hard to obtain oil.
3745 2018-12-31 16:54:58 Place cast iron skillet in the oven & turn on to 500 degrees. Once oven reaches 500, remove skillet and place on the range top. Turn to high 4 minutes. Rub oil on both sides of the steak. Place steak in skillet for 30 seconds. Flip steak and put in the oven. Cook 2 min per side.
3746 2018-12-31 16:54:56 If you are to protect a strategic oil refinery, you would stock it with specific *special* slave labor so that the enemy would debate and hold off from bombing it for as long as possible.
3747 2018-12-31 16:54:55 Enjammied! Checked the fuel oil levels, took stock of the cupboards too. Let it blow and snow! :)
3748 2018-12-31 16:54:47 You didn’t really think liberals or the DPRC care about the environment do you? Trust one thing, if President XI said China wants CDN oil you guys would have a pipeline tomorrow. Canada is a third world economy controlled by China. Coal wins.

3762 2018-12-31 16:53:44 So oil demand hasn’t gone up in the US in 14 years?
3763 2018-12-31 16:53:35 Your point? They failed solely because of the oil economy.
3764 2018-12-31 16:53:34 そろそろダブりそうで怖い
3765 2018-12-31 16:53:33 No nation wants to do anything because, worst case scenario, they don’t want to resettle these Africans in their own respective first world countries. Plus there aren’t any oil or other resources which they can commandeer. 
3766 2018-12-31 16:53:25 Sana oil
3767 2018-12-31 16:53:25 More smoke & mirrors? And then there’s the little Xmas gifts Trump gave Putin:

- Two human migration trains to the heart of Europe and USA
- And One New NUCLEAR MILITARY BASE in “America’s Backyard”
3768 2018-12-31 16:53:24 China and Russia is trying to work together to get control of most of oil production around the world
3769 2018-12-31 16:53:22 Divy is confirmed for 2019 as long as oil doesn’t get shafted lower. Insiders buying atm as well.  Not a bad reversal play imo.

Excuse after excuse from oil patch. Every nation must radically reduce carbon. CANADIANS job is to fix CANADA, not China.
3772 2018-12-31 16:52:54 Going for an oil change is usually pretty chill like? Do nothing for a few hours, catch up on podcasts, whatever but this WOMAN needs to be having IMPORTANT BUSINESS CALLS  AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS

3778 2018-12-31 16:52:06 The oil subsidy game is a far bigger one. If you want to save tax dollar try saving those before the pennies out to EV's. Even with tax bailouts old car companies took far more, and only Tesla paid them back with interest.
3779 2018-12-31 16:51:54 bus your guy is awash in corporate pac money and oil money. Stop you are embarrassing yourself.

3782 2018-12-31 16:51:32 Oil usage will continue to grow for at least 20 years. Sorry to burst your bubble.
3783 2018-12-31 16:51:32 I hold this among other energy names. Tax loss selling season is over and their div is still sustainable at today's prices, but yield shows div cut being priced in. Chart looks good post tax loss, lots of bullish catalysts for oil coming.

3787 2018-12-31 16:51:22 I agree 100% CBD oil is amazing, I’ve been using it for many years for my health issues. I’m just trying to get people to realize that there is more to oil and petrochemicals then driving cars and stuff like that, that it’s everywhere in our society.
3788 2018-12-31 16:51:18 Yes, it’s sucks.. I put all 4 on my car today with an alignment and an oil change it’ll cost me about $750.
3789 2018-12-31 16:51:16 Again what did we learn today....oil down market down....oil up market....come on @realDonaldTrump
3790 2018-12-31 16:51:13 Thanks for the offer but the nearest Sears service center to me closed and I’m not about to drive 20 miles in SoCal traffic for an oil change.
3791 2018-12-31 16:51:08 get some aloe vera or coconut oil

3793 2018-12-31 16:51:00 @elfurberino @Devin_HH @BryanBeulin @Storagezilla interesting concept. Snake oil, or the future of DBs?
3794 2018-12-31 16:50:56 Lmaooo facts gotta be and yeah you lit lit getting your oil changed and gettin paid at same time
3795 2018-12-31 16:50:56 The environmental impact of EV's are insignificant. Even when the power is generated by oil it is done a lot more efficiently than when burned in a car. Lithium is clean to mine. Copper is about its biggest resource, and dirtiest. So the propaganda you listen to is incorrect.

3798 2018-12-31 16:50:47 Pretty big drop out of the blue. Oil price drop maybe?
3799 2018-12-31 16:50:44 10:49a - Pretty ticked off. Forgot I started buying canola oil instead of vegetable. Off to Target.
3800 2018-12-31 16:50:41 Lube, lots of lube oil...see Star Wars Ep IV for reference.
3801 2018-12-31 16:50:36 They should be even lower. We have 3 oil wells in the US alone that could keep it going for 200 years without running out.
3802 2018-12-31 16:50:33 Why would US need Syria to give weapons to the Kurds? LOL US has a base in KURDISTAN, dumb-bum! LOL Russia does gain profit from oil. They get a percentage. That's why the Tsar sent those 200 soldiers to their deaths :(.

3810 2018-12-31 16:49:58 Go work in other places in the world in the oil industry or any other industry for that matter. You would be blown away by how many emission regulations/ money invested in CO2 capturing in Canada, which is a good thing. Go and spout off in Saudi about emissions, I dare you.
3811 2018-12-31 16:49:57 They are right. You shouldn’t take donations from the nefarious influences on our government. You should support the green new deal without compromise to oil corps. Otherwise you are a fraud candidate representing corporate democrats. Stand for something. That’s all we ask.
3812 2018-12-31 16:49:56 If US wants to import all its oil, it will have to price gold in USD accordingly (cheaper gold, stronger USD).  If US wants to produce its own oil entirely, it will have to price gold in USD accordingly (higher gold, weaker USD.)  Gold becomes the reference point instead of USD.
3813 2018-12-31 16:49:55 This morning my dad got my oil changed and cleaned and put gas in my car and I’m honestly so blessed to have him
3814 2018-12-31 16:49:53 Baby oil wkwk
3815 2018-12-31 16:49:40 Your right, we should ship more oil by rail and boat. From countries that have no morals. You people are so blind when it comes to actual facts about our “dirty oil”
3816 2018-12-31 16:49:38 I'm being forced to watch The View while waiting for an oil change. This is a more effective form of torture than waterboarding.
3817 2018-12-31 16:49:34 Is t Qatar job to sell there oil to the world
3818 2018-12-31 16:49:33 Oil tp aku sukanya milk sudah cukup bersih
3819 2018-12-31 16:49:31 Well you better start screaming at the Chinese, Russians and plenty of other countries that aren't doing jack sh@t about emissions. Go look up how many new coal plants the Chinese alone are building...And oil will be very relevant for another 100 years...
3820 2018-12-31 16:49:30 The only ones who are against the carbon tax are, oil and gas companies, the politicians who are paid by them, and billion dollar companies who pollute a lot. Oh... and those that have actually been duped. 

I mean, who are you gonna believe on this?

3834 2018-12-31 16:48:49 Oil actually is unsustaibable if you look at more than just how much oil there is. The impact of oil is unsustainable, and kills far too many people currently.

3882 2018-12-31 16:44:55 Have you told the truth to those guys?  Did you mention the hearings and world glut of oil?  Are they aware of car plants switching over to electric vehicles?  How bout climate change and what to do?Industry is on board with carbon pricing, why not you?
3883 2018-12-31 16:44:55 This  I use olive oil with butter (olive oil will burn and blacken at high temp on its own) also toss whole cloves of garlic to season the oil/butter. Otherwise, this is the way to do it.

3902 2018-12-31 16:42:52 I found that true during my traveling days in Italy. The highly rated restaurants were good (and expensive).

3909 2018-12-31 16:41:25 The thing about capitalism that we've seen in the past is that there's always one company that will take advantage of the opportunity and grow as a result. There will be companies that stem from AVs or EVs that will grow and become larger than the oil industry.

3920 2018-12-31 16:40:27 It probably is true. You can argue that there’s not enough evidence to prove it (though Stalin had every incentive to bury evidence that Hitler’s sucker punch beat his own by days) but it’s a solid theory. Maybe Stalin sold oil for same reason Hitler bought it— to lull his victim

3933 2018-12-31 16:39:14 Not enough people on the same page to do so. It has to start from the rich people because they have more resources because of their financial stature. But they’d rather keep drilling the earth for oil and militarizing and policing the world because they want control

Rub the steak with whatever rub you have  or S&P then olive oil on both sides.

3947 2018-12-31 16:38:02 Funny, Liberals suddenly now admit they believe that gas prices are largely determined by market forces. 

Good to know!

When Wynne was Premier, Liberals blamed fluctuations in gas prices on big greedy big oil companies fleecing poor consumers - taxes played no role.

keep in mind that oils decompose and become bitter when they burn, and harder to digest. So I don't use them for high heat searing unless necessary. 

when you sear something else, like chicken or fish, with oil

Alternatives to conventional feedstocks can be developed, but compared to the abundance of oil, NGLs, and NG, it’s expensive to use alternatives (like synthetic fuels) unless externalities are priced
3955 2018-12-31 16:37:46 woke up and the first thing i did was shatter my cbd oil on the floor 
3956 2018-12-31 16:37:36 Police body cam footage of Chris's Watts house. He's the guy who murdered his family and then put the little girls in oil tanks.
3957 2018-12-31 16:37:26 Top one must be oil .. 
3958 2018-12-31 16:37:22 Thanks, Carrie! What’s the scoop on coconut oil? People add it to their smoothie and use it to cook but it is solid if not warmed up.
3959 2018-12-31 16:37:17 Okay sorry but people who only smoke “carts” are corny and y’all wasting your money on cheap garbage oil lmao
3960 2018-12-31 16:37:16 in other parts of the country but they are treated like they are solely responsible for killing the planet.  Shutting down their jobs is not going to do that. And for those who say you have to start somewhere, look into yourselves and stop using oil products
3961 2018-12-31 16:37:07 I don’t need to google it, thanks but that has nothing to do with my statement. Hemp oil is not a viable solution to all things healthcare.
3962 2018-12-31 16:37:07 News flash....every barrel of oil is traded around 16 times BEFORE it is refined. Trading starts when it is still in the ground.
3963 2018-12-31 16:37:06 I've been a Dawn stan ever since I found out it was the go-to for cleaning wildlife caught in oil spills.

3966 2018-12-31 16:37:01 Trump has asked his Energy Suppliers to figure out a way of storing and mining from the Rooney of houses, work is at its early stage but we are assured that they are burning the Midnight Oil.
3967 2018-12-31 16:36:59 Why do we export simsim? Why don't we process vegetable oil from the simsim and we make animal feeds from the residues #M7NewYearAddress

3970 2018-12-31 16:36:32 Michael Moore is a nasty insignificant person who truly suffers from Trump Derangement Syndrome! Someday he might wash his hair & change the oil in his silly cap!
3971 2018-12-31 16:36:23 Total bullshit. Oil prices are way down. And what cost will future generations pay for Ford's disregard for the climate problem? Way more than a nickel — that's for sure.
3972 2018-12-31 16:36:08 Cleansing oil kose. Fw himalaya/Cetaphil. Cosrx yg one step pad. Masker beautetox.
3973 2018-12-31 16:35:56 When farmers eventually say Feck You (and they will) and grow just for themselves and neighbours, ppl in cities begin to starve, and freeze, because they don't like oil, we'll see who's best prepared to survive. 
I know I will.
3974 2018-12-31 16:35:56 meaning oil prices will reduce in 2019
3975 2018-12-31 16:35:54 All you green idiots should not be allowed to use any oil or gas products period.

3979 2018-12-31 16:35:31 Put a surtax on Texas oil and gas to cover the cost.
3980 2018-12-31 16:35:30 What's name of that essential oil diffuser
3981 2018-12-31 16:35:30 this trained chef seasons both sides, and sears the steak by placing it into a very hot skillet (not teflon) without oil or butter. it would stick if you try to turn or remove it before it is browned, but if you are patient and wait for each side to brown it doesn't stick, and
3982 2018-12-31 16:35:19 Lmao tbh biotin pills and shea moisture Jamaican caster oil
3983 2018-12-31 16:35:14 If you have an iron skillet that works best.  They can be delicious this way.  Add a bit of oil, your choice, and any seasoning or rub on the steak.  Cook to your liking.  Higher temp first for a seat if you like that.  Then let cook through at lower temp.
3984 2018-12-31 16:35:02 I'm against subsidies to all industries,  but the federal govt raised $25.0B on gasoline sales taxes and another $10.2B on diesel in TY14, not ncluding taxes paid by oil/gas cos on income, etc, nor state taxes. All told, oil/gas companies paid well over $120B in taxes in TY17.
3985 2018-12-31 16:34:56 Wonder if Ms Cox and Ms Gandy are still teaching at Central. We were like oil and water.

3994 2018-12-31 16:34:12 Aren’t online polls viewed as skewed? Separation is being discussed everywhere & esp from people who’ve lived here their whole lives! Watching the liberals & ndp purposely landlock & cripple oil & gas has changed things! The federal election will be the final determining factor!
3995 2018-12-31 16:34:11 Are you in a state where cbd oil is legal for medical use? It's been shown to help with epilepsy.
3996 2018-12-31 16:34:06 Whenever I think about going to go get a oil change I just always think it’s gone take forever cuz when I go w/ Nyree her ppl take a year
3997 2018-12-31 16:34:01 CBD Oil is being sold at the corner store along with Vap Pens. Everyone prefers it to Pharma which Kills every 19min.

4000 2018-12-31 16:33:54 Is it trust and accountability when you're taking credit for something you had nothing to do with? The cost of oil is down. Is it keeping election promises when you cancel basic income and open the green belt to development? #promisemadepromisebroken #onpoli

4003 2018-12-31 16:33:35 You should probably shut the gas off to your house and sell your car. That’s making a difference. Shame on keeping your house warm worth that dirty oil
4004 2018-12-31 16:33:30 Saudi’s pumping cheap oil into the market as energy economy switches to renewables. In 30 years water will be more expensive than oil ...not a good thing if you live in a desert.

4021 2018-12-31 16:31:45 Heated dip sticks keep the engine oil warm and that keeps the block warm and oil flows freely. However, an alternate is a 100 to 150 watt light bulb between the block and radiator during the night and a news paper over the grill

4027 2018-12-31 16:31:04 Just cleaning up the environmental damage, alone, will take a long time. And some of it can’t be “fixed.” Ex: An oil spill is forever. The damage to health from toxins can’t be undone.  (Like trying to unfry an egg and put it back in the shell.)

4071 2018-12-31 16:27:17 Good luck. I did the summer vegan challenge and found it quiet easy , although to be 100% long term would be difficult . Some things are marketed as vegan but actually aren't e.g.. Oreos,  they contain dirty palm oil . You really need to do your home work .

4078 2018-12-31 16:26:16 yeah no shit, but he's not a journalist.  He's a shill.  And what a surprise, someone that is paid by the oil lobby speaks against climate change and environmentalists.

Trudeau's not a journalist either, so not sure what your point is there.
4079 2018-12-31 16:26:04 Are movements to develop non-petro feedstock inputs driven by concerns over possible scarcity of primary inputs like oil? Or are they driven by environmental considerations associated with developing products? EVs may alleviate the former, but not the latter. I’m no expert though
4080 2018-12-31 16:26:00 It's so unscientific for scientists to believe in science. Much more scientific to believe in oil company propaganda.

4088 2018-12-31 16:25:09 Agree on wasteful spending, like corporate handouts, corporate tax cuts and oil pipelines should be stopped. 

Billions recouped to be spent on housing the homeless, clean water for Indian reserves, and school lunch programs for poor kids.
4089 2018-12-31 16:25:08 I’m tired of coconut oil not doing this magic it’s suppose to do. Leave it in 2018.

4091 2018-12-31 16:25:05 to better combat CO2. Other places in the world (south) aren't doing much, what our 37 million people do is not going to effect the climate when others (Saudi Arabia) continues to produce dirty oil...FYI the tar sands were uninhabitable before oil comp.'s moved in.
4092 2018-12-31 16:25:02 I think maybe it's the acidity issue. It started with oil and fried things. Been increasing since then.

4095 2018-12-31 16:24:57 Poured hot cooking oil into the trash. Didn't know the bag melted until I was taking it out when it ripped and dumped oil and coffee grounds on a rug. Tried to clean the rug with baking soda which made an even bigger mess so I just threw it into the shower and went to bed

4097 2018-12-31 16:24:30 He loves oil so much. How about we do this, all the climate change deniers can start eating oil to survive since they love it so much.
4098 2018-12-31 16:24:07 I just realized that this is the first year I can remember that my parents didn't include a toothbrush in my Christmas stocking and I'm pretty disappointed now that I'm an adult and actually value those sorts of things. (Note: I did get beard oil)

4100 2018-12-31 16:23:58 Cast iron skillet. Super hot skillet, a bit of oil (high heat like peanut or grapeseed), room temp steaks salted both sides (kosher salt). Put steak in, wiggle just a bit to prevent sticking, then leave it be until ready to flip (only once). Use instant read meat thermometer
4101 2018-12-31 16:23:52 Simple. Toss in a little oil. Salt and pepper. Oven for around 10 mins - stir half way 
4102 2018-12-31 16:23:46 No. A smear is when false information is used. You can clearly see how he backed away from Medicare for All, and it is easy to see his contributions from oil and gas.
4103 2018-12-31 16:23:45 Did you read your sentence over before Tweeting it? The fact that he’s biased means his opinion is automatically disqualified. The fact that Sheer is quoting the CEO of an oil company over the head of a green energy company alone proves his claim is bullshit.
4104 2018-12-31 16:23:40 #StockMarket Trimmed some tech on open . All hedges holding. Only 20% in stocks now. Short term bonds and cash when I see 2019 opens. Watching #Gold #Dollar #Oil . Going to beach and enjoying the day. We see

4107 2018-12-31 16:23:40 Some people try to tell me the Syrian conflict is not another oil war. Yes, there are other issues, but control of oil & gas reserves, wells & pipelines is a major part of what they are fighting about

4109 2018-12-31 16:23:25 He actually diversified the economy I can show u the chart that says that oil just made up only 25% of GDP the problem was oil made more than 70% of govt revenue,that was the impact of oil on the economy,the services sector made up more GDP than oil under Gej govt
4110 2018-12-31 16:23:21 Your problem is with unchecked free market capitalism.
Independence won’t change that.
And I still don’t know what assets Scotland has apart from privately owned oil fields, a shipyard and tourism.
4111 2018-12-31 16:23:19 Us oil production numbers were just published.  They are a new high.
4112 2018-12-31 16:23:18 very well, that is why he is a snake oil salesman
4113 2018-12-31 16:23:18 The great irony in this story: who pays for Calif's cap&trade-based heavy oil subsidies? Quebec importers of Calif's CO2 allowances & Cdn corps who export natural gas & electricity to California. Ugh! This is because, under the cap&trade rule, any entity that supplies natural...2

4115 2018-12-31 16:23:05 I had the world's dumbest crossword idea while asleep last night. 

WATERSHIP DOWN. Clue water's "ships" (romantic potentials) as OTP tropes. So the word OIL would be going down with the clue "H2O OTP: enemies to lovers"

I'll show myself out.

#NYTXW
4116 2018-12-31 16:23:04 Yeah I’ve tried making my own using natural recipes I found on some blogs. I’ve tried a few natural brands like Tom’s. I think my problem is my skin is just too sensitive. I’ve never tried charcoal, though. I love coconut oil but it just doesn’t do the trick in masking odors.
4117 2018-12-31 16:23:03 We can help you with that oil change you need.  Come see us. 12186 N Mopac Expy, Austin, TX, US, 78758
4118 2018-12-31 16:23:01 Okay but big businesses that are dumping chemicals and oil into the ocean are a huge problem. its not just on the backs of consumers. Businesses do way more damage than the average consumer. We need tighter laws on how businesses are allowed operate keeping the planet in mind.
4119 2018-12-31 16:23:01 Yup. I worked in a restaurant during the oil boom; we were haemorrhaging workers because very few wanted to bust their ass for minimum wage when the oil companies were offering $4,000/month to do fuck all. In response, the government expanded the temporary foreign worker program.

4123 2018-12-31 16:22:14 why do all the lil debbie snax contain soybean oil smh
4124 2018-12-31 16:22:13 So to answer your question.  Nope, nobody can explain it.  They (but not all Albertans) want government to get out of the way and let market forces build the pipeline.  But it's the market (low oil prices) that are putting the final nails in that coffin.
4125 2018-12-31 16:22:07 But, the real reason why this all has failed is a direct result of the billions of dollars of funding flowing in from the Packard and Rockefeller foundation, which also receive funding from groups tied directly to US state department.  The US does not want Canada to export oil.
4126 2018-12-31 16:22:07 Today is change the oil in the Sierra day. Study for ACLS. Relax for work tomorrow. Pray that the fireworks aren't too obnoxious tonight. 
4127 2018-12-31 16:22:07 EXACTLY my point. Exxon’s tv promos about green energy was decade’s worth of bs. Now that their efforts to suppress alt. energy has been overcome they and lther oil cos. are getting serious as opposed to just PR bs.
4128 2018-12-31 16:22:04 I thought north Spain had the world best silver. Olive oil is important to cook healthy!
4129 2018-12-31 16:22:01 If oil bounces soon you should see $OIH oil stocks and $WFT over 0.5+ to blast higher
4130 2018-12-31 16:21:55 My air popper gave up the ghost last night, in mid pop; I set up my flic, got my fire going, poured myself a pint and a party favour, popcorn was the last step, aaaand I get a combo of burnt & unpopped!
I got a pot of oil heated up, clean up the mess, and best popcorn ever. 
4131 2018-12-31 16:21:52 By that logic, it is nut free if it is cooked in nut oil and vegetarian if they pick the chicken out of the chicken and mushroom pie ? #crosscontamination
4132 2018-12-31 16:21:50 Let's start with you giving up your car, the heat for your house, the clothes & furniture made from oil byproducts and your electricity, because even your green power requires resources oil to build and operate. Let's get these pipelines built in 2019 Andrew.
4133 2018-12-31 16:21:48 @FraterXavier Some time in the future will you make a video showing us how to make anointing oil?
4134 2018-12-31 16:21:42 I understand the horrifying burns the victims endured and you yourself witnessed the excruciating pain and suffering of the teenagers, which still affects you greatly.
My father's brother was severely burnt in an explosion at an Oil Refinery, he was unrecognizable
You are so kind
4135 2018-12-31 16:21:41 Yeah that David Suzuki of multiple million dollar properties, countless flights to peach the gospel at 50k a pop and his real estate development partners Kootenay Oil.   Like the church the gospel always has a price lathered with hypocrisy
4136 2018-12-31 16:21:36 kindly dont post fake data. price of crude oil in 2014 & in 2018 then compare price.

service tax 12% to 18%

govt job vacancy & private job. 
go and compare
4137 2018-12-31 16:21:34 EIA: US net imports of crude oil and petroleum products fell to a record low of 1.399 mbpd in October.
4138 2018-12-31 16:21:33 I'm going to see if my friend's son will lend a hand. I may skip the radiator, but need to wire some sort of ignition switch (toggle) and starter (button) as all the wiring from firewall forward is in a box. Mandatory is an oil pressure gauge. I need a list.

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
4145 2018-12-31 16:21:11 Salt and pepper the meat several hours before cooking. 
Heat pan and use olive oil, get it HOT.
Place steak on pan to sear, several minutes per side.
If you like over med rare you can finish in oven.
You can place onions and garlic in the pan while searing to add favor.
4146 2018-12-31 16:21:08 I'm heating up oil to fry beignets, so I'm right there with you.
4147 2018-12-31 16:21:06 Bunk  I got some wicked smelling essential body oil
4148 2018-12-31 16:21:05 Good silver? Sorry, I don't understand. We have good olive oil, that's for sure ;)

Shame on you for causing the global oil price to collapse, thus crippling the Alberta oil economy.
4151 2018-12-31 16:20:47 I was just thinking how I havent taken my black seed oil in a couple of weeks.

4153 2018-12-31 16:20:38 This is the dumbest.  these people should be asking for job training to relevant field.   ROE of alberta oil forces subsidies to keep them alive.  Might as well move to something sustainable .  STOP subsidizing big oil!
4154 2018-12-31 16:20:31 what's the most effective essential oil for difficulty dealing with people?
Chloroform.
4155 2018-12-31 16:20:28 There’s a goo that makes it too slippery. It’s like a long lasting oil that’s safe but makes it too hard for squirrels. Also, certain collars work well, research them, they have to have a under tipurned lip. (If that makes sense) they look like dog collars and go round the top.

4159 2018-12-31 16:20:02 Again, is there going to be a purity test on the type of jobs that are acceptable to make donations? I guess we would be out. My husband was in the military for 27 years and now works at the Pentagon. No money from pharma, Boeing,gas/oil employees. Let us know which jobs are good
4160 2018-12-31 16:19:52 trying Oregano Oil in water for gargling for Strep Throat/Blocked ears etc - well what can I say? nearly blew my hair off after one sip/gargle so diluted further go again -taste yuk BUT beginning to clear ears :O give it a go smear mild toothpaste under top lip for taste shock
4161 2018-12-31 16:19:51 Of course it is to u.  U luv all Trudeau tells u. U r a minion.  U can’t grasp anything else.U feel better if exporting coal to China and bringing back finished goods to Canada.  That way it’s not our carbon footprint.  Or better yet importing  Saudi oil.
4162 2018-12-31 16:19:50 Mannnn these car people don’t miss a beat.  Just give me an oil change and keep it moving!
4163 2018-12-31 16:19:45 What are your thoughts about the Bible that is flowing oil? Not going to ask if its real because it obviously is. Is it of God?  @JustinPetersMin @Costi @raycomfort
4164 2018-12-31 16:19:43 The majority of refugees in Europe are caused exclusively by the American (UK backed without question) foreign policy, wars for oil to get puppet governments to make their rich friends richer. And the cunts still blame the refugees. And nobody question them. Shame
4165 2018-12-31 16:19:33 Indeed Bad Governance and Corruption is killing a generation since 1958 when the first oil well was found.
4166 2018-12-31 16:19:31 Trump is trying to destroy our country. Removing restrictions on companies that  pollute our environment. Removing restrictions  hunting endangered species.  And allowing destructive fracking and oil drilling off of our coasts. He has no care for the future  of Earth or America.
4167 2018-12-31 16:19:15 Like I'm already planning some sons of anarchy shit if I ever get trapped.. replace her coffee creamer with cannabis oil and call the cops on her while she taking my kid to school..  #Petty
4168 2018-12-31 16:19:12 Some oil. The integrated companies are doing just fine.

4177 2018-12-31 16:18:27 Did all this neglect if agriculture and dependence on oil revenues,  decadence and collapse of public education, fatalism,  septicextremism and toxic inter ethnic violence etc just happens within the period of this current administration?

4179 2018-12-31 16:18:10 Ahn Ahn. You Sabi! Love the argan oil serum. Don't use it regularly but the effect of a night's usage can last for days 
4180 2018-12-31 16:18:08 I don't get the narrative, it is simple, when ice melts to dangerous levels and affects ocean levels, just add water in winter,what is so hard about that. If we can pipe oil, we can pipe water, build solar desalination plants on ocean drilling platforms, pipe water in. #RT #quote
4181 2018-12-31 16:18:06 Your reference to Medieval solutions brought me to wonder why they have yet to suggest a huge moat filled with alligators, and burning oil poured down from that magnificent artistic steel slat fencing they want to install.
4182 2018-12-31 16:17:52 Indeed they are. But oil and water coexist in this world, even if they don't mix very well. That's the way I seek.

4185 2018-12-31 16:17:32 turns out an oil price turnaround needs more than a "long and very good call" with China
4186 2018-12-31 16:17:31 Who cooks chips in a big pan of oil these days,  its oven chips all the way now.
4187 2018-12-31 16:17:31 So tell us how many pipelines to tidewater you and Harper built when oil prices were high? None? That is correct. At least the Liberals are trying to get one built. You guys are all hat and no cattle with no plans to improve things. As Bill Maher would say, whiny little bitches.
4188 2018-12-31 16:17:29 What is interesting is the oil and gas industry support a price on carbon
4189 2018-12-31 16:17:29 Had to get that oil change today. Couldn’t be out here slipping just in case.
4190 2018-12-31 16:17:27 @FLWFishing today’s checklist for the 2019 Tour, oil change, new tires, spare prop, just about ready to head to Texas with @RangerBoats hooked up and ready.
4191 2018-12-31 16:17:20 Correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t Alberta oil a Koch Bros baby?  So maybe it’s not about Canada but a fight between the rich?
4192 2018-12-31 16:17:19 This was a bangin’ year for music. Here’s my top 10 albums of 2018:

9. SOPHIE - OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S UN-INSIDES
8. Iglooghost - Clear Tamei/Steel Mogu
7. Amnesia Scanner - Another Life
6. Anna von Hausswolff - Dead Magic
4193 2018-12-31 16:17:05 Perhaps we can place sentries with pots of boiling oil on minarets, in keeping with Medieval solutions to modern problems. And let's put the border patrol in suits of armor.
4194 2018-12-31 16:16:58 For tv shows, I found Salt, Acid, Fat and Heat on Netflix to be fun and educational. Like who knew the fresher the olive oil the better it is?!
4195 2018-12-31 16:16:52 May Allah reward you
4196 2018-12-31 16:16:44 Seasonality for #oil Typically it starts picking up mid Jan. Scaling in to a few oil plays.
4197 2018-12-31 16:16:42 finally got my oil changed 
4198 2018-12-31 16:16:36 I like Beto, but he'd have to commit to some progressive ideals. He talks a good game, but his voting record isn't stellar. It's one thing to vote for TX oil and gas interests as a TX senator, but another as a Dem presidential nominee. He's been mixed on banking regulation, too.
4199 2018-12-31 16:16:35 Their economy is roughly the size of California. Their budget is based 75% on oil and it is like $50 a barrel. Go ahead. Who gives an f?
4200 2018-12-31 16:16:33 “Increased visibility” is an incorrect presupposition on NBC’s part that their credibility is not on the decline.
4201 2018-12-31 16:16:26 me after i do my makeup and my face starts getting oily like def not glowing just the oil but thx
4202 2018-12-31 16:16:22 I was not expecting your response. If you really believe that, then how can you put your money in oil companies (bonds) when they will continue to struggle as the supply of oil grows?
4203 2018-12-31 16:16:21 How many years did he stay in Jail? Do you know what is Kolhu? Have you ever seen oil extraction? Now imagine human beings doing that!
Have you no shame?
4204 2018-12-31 16:16:18 If you have natural oil spills in the ocean, the solution is not to drill more holes to increase the amount. That you have a certain amount „naturally“ does not say more is not an issue
4205 2018-12-31 16:16:04 I get eclairs from Wegmans—they used to be perfect, just the right amount of crisp and give. Then they changed. Still good, but not great. Contacted them, and they told me they’d switched away from palm oil and why. Okay. I will totally take a lesser eclair for the greater good.
4206 2018-12-31 16:16:02 Big moment of 2018 - @AndiPetrillo gets an oil change.

今年もよろしく♪
4218 2018-12-31 16:14:00 I read “Dan Quinn oil....” then thought I’d had a stroke. It’s been a long day 
4219 2018-12-31 16:13:58 I mean yes she could be more specific and say cap and trade, but to claim neither has an effect on gas prices I don’t think is accurate (even though it’s obvious that removal of it is not the primary reason for current drop in oil prices globally)
4220 2018-12-31 16:13:47 @stephenfry just came across Bill Turnbull after I googled to see how you were doing. Didn’t realise he was suffering- one of my acquaintances uses a strong CBD oil daily, his Drs are amazed how much it delays/flights (not sure) his issues. Best of luck 
4221 2018-12-31 16:13:40 every since they changed and went with that different oil they use
4222 2018-12-31 16:13:22 It’s an oil. Sadly I’m not that tan lol
4223 2018-12-31 16:13:19 I’m proud of you , peppermint oil and a water bottle you’ll be perf in 15 mins 
4224 2018-12-31 16:13:17 Will—I thought I read a couple days ago that the EPA was set to shutter itself up due to the Fed govt shutdown. Are you doing ok down there? Things seem brighter up here.
4225 2018-12-31 16:12:57 wow coconut oil has become my enemy. my hair hates it... my skin hates it... 
4226 2018-12-31 16:12:48 The sacristy has the sacrarium, a sink or even a basin alone which goes to the ground. You use it for holy water, holy oil (when it isn’t burned, and you finish cleaning vessels), etc. 

You also pour the water of first washings of the eucharistic linens in the sacrarium.

4228 2018-12-31 16:12:40 In 1981, I lived in Winnipeg Susan. That January, the temp never topped -30c. One Sunday, the temp was -50 and the wind was blowing 55-65kph. Even with a block heater, battery blanket and oil pan heater, the car didn’t even make a sound when i turned the key.
No church that day.
4229 2018-12-31 16:12:40 今年もよろしくねーーーーーーwwwwwwww
4230 2018-12-31 16:12:38 Interesting read. I can relate 2 lumps/boils having had a few. Whilst they have been uncomfortable I've managed them mid ride with T-tree oil. DON'T SQUEEZE! It is really easy 2 break the folicule or pore allowing the puss to infect the surrounding tissue & may be reason 4 blood
4231 2018-12-31 16:12:38 Yes oil but just a little 
I usually cut it into 2 inch steaks before cooking 
Because it doesn't have much fat some people wrap it in bacon
4232 2018-12-31 16:12:36 Engine oil?
4233 2018-12-31 16:12:33 有能な絆枠が出来てしまいましたなぁ...
4234 2018-12-31 16:12:32 Yea, because jokes about oil and cellphones was his only material. 
4235 2018-12-31 16:12:24 I didn't have a fanny acne as a 15yr old wee boy. Can you no use baby oil if you can use olive oil?
4236 2018-12-31 16:12:21 คบแล้วโว้ยยยยย #ซอมบี้ถาปัต
4237 2018-12-31 16:12:10 If the price is not right. The investment isn’t there. From what I hear, it cost a lot to extract oil sands. At at current price, is it viable? Not to sound like a dick.
4238 2018-12-31 16:12:09 He doesn’t sell snake oil, he is the snake. Like all reptiles, he is cold blooded and can only react to the environment from a place of survival, not think. Then add on psychopathic narcissism, Bingo. IMHO
4239 2018-12-31 16:12:08 At current global prices of oil,the new prices announced by PTI govt. are unjustified.
4240 2018-12-31 16:12:01 Are these deals Chia’s? These are the same deals we have seen since 07. OBC still pulling strings and letting Chia stew on hot seat? Either way, this is another kick in the nuts to the Oil faithful.
4241 2018-12-31 16:11:59 Several refs already to Pocahontas name. Trump’s disgusting name calling especially Cooked Hillary who was anything but still rings in our ears. Hopefully the 2020 electorate will not fall for this snake oil salesman’s classless act.
4242 2018-12-31 16:11:47 I need to change oil real bad..
4243 2018-12-31 16:11:37 It IS remarkable when it’s the main shill of the oil industry/Republicans. You missed the point entirely. You are clearly uninterested in fact based information. The science isn’t weak - THAT is the concession, hence eventual enlightening of Jerry Taylor.
4244 2018-12-31 16:11:35 Oil and gas industry might be the move 
4245 2018-12-31 16:11:31 Highlights from the English menu at today’s restaurant in Beijing:

4247 2018-12-31 16:11:27 Story I'd really like to write/work on someday: Anything relating to modern day snake oil salesmen

You know the ones. The Instagram famous, juice peddling ones
4248 2018-12-31 16:11:19 When I come to think about it of course, he knew perfectly well it was irrelevant because it didn’t matter whether the oil came from the Scottish or the English sector, the money still went straight to London.  
4249 2018-12-31 16:11:16 Ohhhh nooo, I know some places avoid peanut oil & peanuts. But, I know it’s not worth the gamble. Making it at home so super easy if you find a curry paste you love. It’s very quick!
4250 2018-12-31 16:11:16 Repeal oil subsidies and push that into the GND
4251 2018-12-31 16:11:11 Why don’t you take action on building a pipeline? Both with British Columbia’s and Quebec.Oh that’s right because you are trying to shut down the oil sands.But In reality it’s only killing the smaller oil and gas companies that are not involved in oil sands.
4252 2018-12-31 16:11:10 これ面白いっしょ笑
4253 2018-12-31 16:10:53 .
It's planned, I swear! A conspiracy is brewing to obtain bargaining chips.

Russia visited Venezuela, and American oil workers get "detained" and imprisoned.  Now Russia snatched one.

Chinese executive gets arrested in Canada, then Americans get snatched...in China.
4254 2018-12-31 16:10:47 Cornyn: But we’ve still got oil to sell, y’all!
4255 2018-12-31 16:10:38 あけておめ

4256 2018-12-31 16:10:36 Make sure to have your lamp full of the oil of the Holy Spirit. Don’t wander from His presence lest we are found missing or empty when the Lord comes back for his bride. Be dressed for the wedding banquet. “For no one knows the day or the hour…” (of His second coming)
4257 2018-12-31 16:10:32 I was thinking of doing something with THC oil too. I don’t particularly like smoke. I just like the feeling of calmness it gives me as well.
4258 2018-12-31 16:10:28 Y'all didn't tell me tree tea oil hurts like mad. My entire face is on FIREEEEEE
4259 2018-12-31 16:10:18 I'm sure some Norman can put oil on his head and cure him like they claim
4260 2018-12-31 16:10:17 Gej was fortunate to generate the most due to oil price that hit an all time high at $120 per barrel and couldn't diversify.He was the incumbent,if he was good it will be easy to win,didn't he serve more than 6years?We can do better sir
4261 2018-12-31 16:10:12 A Progressive.  This means no corporate donations, especially oil and gas monies.  Beto accepted oil and gas donations in a very sneaky way.
4262 2018-12-31 16:10:05 Just another day on the farm.  Bringing home veggie oil from a friend's restaurant to run my machinery.  Go green or go home:)
4263 2018-12-31 16:10:04 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
4264 2018-12-31 16:10:01 Maybe get out and do something about it if it upsets you that much? No? Sitting at home taking Xanax. That’s clearly the solution.
4265 2018-12-31 16:09:56 DRY SKIN

•aloe vera & milk cream mask
•oatmeal, milk & honey mask

4266 2018-12-31 16:09:37 Are you drunk so early in the day or just so wholly owned by big oil?
4267 2018-12-31 16:09:31 Start taxing coal to China and teriff foreign oil.
4268 2018-12-31 16:09:17 The next move may be to buy some oil ETF's
4269 2018-12-31 16:09:05 Racist.

Bernie=Progressive populist—policies unite and excite working class Americans—offering them what the rest of the civilized world already has—would/could destroy Trump.

Beto=Progressive in name only—bought by big oil and turned against Medicaid for all—lost against Cruz.

4271 2018-12-31 16:08:51 I am disappointed we are still driving cars. Especially ones that run on gas, and oil. I want hovercraft, flying cars, and trams above the street.
4272 2018-12-31 16:08:48 Exactly.
If Liverpool win the league, honestly it'll hurt, but that's because of a rivalry based on heritage, history, fanbase etc compared to the plaything of oil billionaires. If you win, you deserve it. Simple as that.
4273 2018-12-31 16:08:46 Theres degrees to things. Hes going to have to answer for those things. I dont think he's corrupt and Im not bothered by him taking small contributions from oil EMPLOYEES from TEXAS of all places. Biden is far and wide worse.
4274 2018-12-31 16:08:37 He doesn’t sleep. He’s a vampire who makes his living sucking the blood of all NY’ers. He hibernates in a coffin stuffed in the darkest, dankest recesses of the NYC Subway system and only comes out to sell his poisonous snake oil.
4275 2018-12-31 16:08:31 It really tells you something when even the OIl gene hates Westminster eh 
4276 2018-12-31 16:08:27 Iya. Pake aja Castor oil.

4292 2018-12-31 16:06:22 Venezuela is vast oil fields are in the process of being taken over by Russia. Missile launchers and aircraft will follow soon. As to the Five Americans who were conned to fly to Venezuela. Their part of a kidnap/ransom plan to get some $$ and have been for sale for over a year.
4293 2018-12-31 16:06:08 You could be right. Just sharing what I'm seeing and there are multiple divergences favoring Oil, USD/JPY, WTI and pointing south in the Vix and Bond prices, all supportive of stocks. May not play out that way but that's what the data is saying right now.

4306 2018-12-31 16:04:43 I blame the bleak "scientific" reports.  Lysenko would be proud of his little propagandists.

4308 2018-12-31 16:04:24 Everyone says to use coconut oil as a hair mask. But every time I do, I have to shampoo my hair so many times to get all of the oil out, that my hair is probably just as dry as when I started. What are y’all not telling me, Internet?

Oh and being butt pirates. There's a lot of that in America by both conservatives and
4313 2018-12-31 16:03:46 When the prices were rising ,it was oil companies.when coming down ,it is Modi govt.wah wah.
4314 2018-12-31 16:03:34 No snake oil required today, thanks anyway Donny.
4315 2018-12-31 16:03:28 Renault Zoe’s from £5,000 yes there battery lease but that’s less than fuel and you have no oil changes etc...
4316 2018-12-31 16:03:27 All of this is trumped by that sweet oil industry cash.
4317 2018-12-31 16:03:17 Do you even comprehend - we are staring down The Apocalypse - and you’re still pushing more oil & pipelines!!??  Hon, step outside of your bubble, we are in the precipice!!  We need to come together over this challenge!  Corporations & Big $$, pushing the politicians, don’t care.
4318 2018-12-31 16:03:17 Odd, Russia is the biggest backer of climate change, Nothing hurts their competition more than promoting the dismantling of US  Oil production

4319 2018-12-31 16:03:16 No, it won't; those views are oil and water.

4322 2018-12-31 16:03:03 Hardly anyone uses it as a hedge when compared to the volume of purely  speculative trade. Otherwise, crypto would be running alongside XAU  right now. Instead it's dead cat bounce alongside  DJI/SPX/NDX/NIKKEI/OIL/NATGAS/etc. XAU bullrun and BTC breakdown began  together...
4323 2018-12-31 16:03:00 Don't lie you just like your eggs beaten and emulsified with oil.

4325 2018-12-31 16:02:41 I have to pay for my next oil change. How depressing
4326 2018-12-31 16:02:36 The fish rots from the head and the only way to stop corruption in Washington is shut down the Federal Reserve, the oil interests, Big Pharma and the Pentagon. 
Politicians are slaves to donors. They do there bidding not yours.
4327 2018-12-31 16:02:28 Oh wow, an oil change only costs $75 in Florida compared to the $100+ I paid in Seattle and St. Louis.
4328 2018-12-31 16:02:22 Your suffix is enough to explain your point of view. You'll have to accept that batteries and fuel cells are complementary. You cannot stop the H2 economy and, that you want it or not, Big Oil goes into H2 because it means survival.
4329 2018-12-31 16:02:20 SIBC news: A breezy night in Shetland for first footers and those out and about for the new year but the winds will fall to moderate by Tuesday evening.  A number of fishing boats and oil related vessels have been sheltering east of Shetland, mainly east of Unst, Fetlar and Yell.

4331 2018-12-31 16:02:14 Thanks for the Circuit Courts, Steven Grasz, we will lift the oil export ban in our national.
4332 2018-12-31 16:02:14 Well the Liberals and the left don’t mind DEMONIZING the oil industry and those who stood in their way. Hypocrisy knows no bounds.
4333 2018-12-31 16:02:13 @PTIofficial @ImranKhanPTI crude oil prices went down over 30% in December alone and u lowered local fuel prices by a meagre PKR 4.3 only????? @Asad_Umar for heavens sake have mercy

4341 2018-12-31 16:01:48 If only we could have stopped Bush Sr. from his climate change denial and convincing @GOP it's Junk Science circa 1990s! Or, Obama, even knowing, put US oil independence 1st..he is the Fracking King Prez. We need a #greennewdeal #Sanders2020 #overturncitizensunited

4352 2018-12-31 16:01:06 Would that not also apply to Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil  and all other oil companies?
4353 2018-12-31 16:00:58 I don’t know when people started saying that brushes don’t matter in photoshop only skill, because let me tell you as soon as I discovered the oil paint brush I could suddenly paint so much more than I could previously
4354 2018-12-31 16:00:55 Watching the gentry thrash an urchin--I thought this had been lost to the sands of time. Maybe there's hope after all.
4355 2018-12-31 16:00:53 I tricked my dad into keeping my car a few days and letting me use his truck. I can’t wait to see his reaction when I take his truck back with new tires, oil change, and detailed. The least I can do for my old man! 
4356 2018-12-31 16:00:46 Federal employees haven't even missed a paycheck yet. I know because i was one for over 20 years and went through every shutdown since 94. At this point the supposed govt employees problem is a lack of savings & planning, NOT a lack of pay.
4357 2018-12-31 16:00:46 He’s a snake oil salesman. They don’t have any problem sleeping with their lies.
4358 2018-12-31 16:00:45 A "Canadian treasure" with undisclosed oil ties... You people are such mindless sheep.
4359 2018-12-31 16:00:43 Federal employees have to wait for pay, it’s wrong. 

I think it should include Congress. 

In some sectors of ‘oil and gas’ it takes 4 months. 

How long will it take to help people adversely affected by crimes committed by illegal aliens? 

Build the wall.

4361 2018-12-31 16:00:30 i like cooking it without any butter or oil - on a nonstick skillet it cooks perfectly on it's own and then I don't have to use any additional oil
4362 2018-12-31 16:00:29 @reportpemra please take notice of ad by #soyasupreem cooking oil. The language used in it , like bapp tu bap hota ha chahe tumara ho ya mera. Is never used and accepted in houses. This is impacting badly on the kids. What type of families can accept such language is unbelievable

4369 2018-12-31 15:59:52 After a few days away, the beard shampoo, conditioner & oil from @mobrosgrooming was very welcome and my beard feels lovely again.
I highly recommend their products, they work wonders and have lovely smells.

4371 2018-12-31 15:59:35 Kalo merk aku gatau, soalnya dulu beli share gitu di lapak femaledaily, dia impor gitu jd agak mahal. Kalo mau nyoba yg terjangkau mungkin bisa pake kleveru, kalo gasalah ada yg varian almond oil
4372 2018-12-31 15:59:27 Q: Why don't we just invade Saudi Arabia and take all their oil ? A: because then they wouldn't buy any weapons from us and our economy would collapse.
4373 2018-12-31 15:59:27 Hardly anyone uses it as a hedge when compared to the volume of purely speculative trade. Otherwise, crypto would be running alongside XAU right now. Instead it's dead cat bounce alongside DJI/SPX/NDX/NIKKEI/OIL/NATGAS/etc. XAU bullrun and BTC breakdown began together.

4375 2018-12-31 15:59:19 It's best to apply it at night only as it has citrus (orange) oil, which heightens your skin's sensitivity to the sun - I have sensitive skin. Then for daytime I apply almond or jojoba oil and then apply my sunscreen.

4379 2018-12-31 15:59:02 I have to go tomorrow morning to get an oil changed.

4381 2018-12-31 15:58:38 I get so many spam emails trying to get me to buy CBD oil or just weed in general and I’m like is the universe trying to tell me something or
4382 2018-12-31 15:58:34 I’m going get a oil change Saturday
4383 2018-12-31 15:58:32 طيب ليش ماقفل الاوتيل بهذا اليوم ؟ دامه مايبي احد يجي
4384 2018-12-31 15:58:31 2018 has been a surprise #2019 #bringiton I'll be starting a new job who knows where I'll be this time next year?
4385 2018-12-31 15:58:16 Anybody else notice that whatever #FatNixon calls a win is covered in scabs, dents, is leaking oil, being challenged (and stopped) in the courts, and generally smells like a ripe cadaver?
4386 2018-12-31 15:58:11 Done washed my hair now letting the coconut oil sit for a while before i wash it out
4387 2018-12-31 15:58:03 You promised you would take all the oil and still can't seem to make up your mind about whether or not I.S.I.L. is defeated.
4388 2018-12-31 15:57:57 Does King Trump's wall design include a moat? which side?  how many feet between the solar powered boiling oil caldrons.  So medieval.
4389 2018-12-31 15:57:54 Stormy, ignore the dip-dogs. When you see 'Texas' on their bio you can usually assume that their brain is oil- soaked and uneducated. Don't retweet because they use your supporters to get followers.
4390 2018-12-31 15:57:47 Happy New Year, everyone!!! i-welcome natin ang 2019 na puno ng saya at pagmamahal!!! ahlabyuh oil!!! 
4391 2018-12-31 15:57:43 hrrrnn i kinda wanna try one of those water brushes for watercolors because a lot of people seem to think they're cool, but unfortunately i'm a dumbass who literally uses oil paintbrushes for watercolors atm. i love the firmness and idk how much softer the water brushes are '~'
4392 2018-12-31 15:57:35 Sir, License authorising in Harayana is still illegally processed. I've seen many oil mills being operated without license and proper food standard. Example in behal, siwani! Even tax evasion is at peak.
4393 2018-12-31 15:57:35 The only complaint I see about Norway is always from Scots Britnats, keen to tell you about taxation Norwegians are happy to pay, 5 euro pints when the pound is on the floor, and its national debt near a quarter of UK's per capita gdp, while avoiding its oil wealth fund entirely.
4394 2018-12-31 15:57:15 Older engines are easy, just take the heads off and dump the new oil on the pistons.  Old oil will burn itself off.
4395 2018-12-31 15:57:08 And every other country has the same issue. As an environmentalist I'm sure you must understand that any solution must be international. Mine spills don't stop at the border, nor do oil spills. Animal and bird migrations don't stop at the Canadian border and ask for asylum, LOL
4396 2018-12-31 15:57:06 In 1980 I worked in Malaysia in the offshore oil field. On one particular Barge I bunked on, the laundry staff was all Indonesian transgender sex change people.

That was in 1980. I can imagine with the current hormonial treatments along with surgical improvements, it's probable.
4397 2018-12-31 15:56:54 Facts and @CNN are just like oil and water, they just don't mix

4399 2018-12-31 15:56:43 All these forward earnings and people saying the s&p is trading around 14-15x next years earnings.... you guys forget that oil collapsed and is 25%?
4400 2018-12-31 15:56:40 Where are the jobs? Have you been paying attention to any of the recent pro oil/pipeline rallies? Albertans are hurting, and your arrogant government hasn’t walked back any of your harmful anti-business anti-oil policies!

4403 2018-12-31 15:56:34 When you finally find the time to get your oil changed and your tires rotated but your car won’t start :))))))))))))
4404 2018-12-31 15:56:28 Yes, window glass. Esp if you get a lot of hail. Also window putty and linseed oil for the dry wood frames.
We keep spare boxes for electrical and plumbing work. Spares save you money and time.

4408 2018-12-31 15:56:01 Knowledge puffs up. I don't give a damn how much knowledge theologians with degrees have or priests who've studied for nine years have. Knowledge can take you straight to hell in a handbasket!! GOD desires his Annointing Oil from heaven to be upon His Chosen. Spritual Pride gone!

4410 2018-12-31 15:55:32 You're abandoning America's allies, the Kurds to  genocide at the hands of Erdogan's American equipped military.

That's not a good look to American friends and allies. 

You're actually allowing Putin to secure Assad's power in Syria and seizes Syrian and Iraq's oil reserves
4411 2018-12-31 15:55:21 On the plus side: free oil change!
4412 2018-12-31 15:55:13 Or oil coming in from offshore?
4413 2018-12-31 15:55:10 So you’re saying we should protest our way into parliament and governance?
How about we demand our politicians come up with a plan, a real plan, that will carry him / her into office.
I’m 100% for the pipeline and building the oil patch, but we need a plan for the whole country.

4415 2018-12-31 15:55:04 DEVELOPING OIL DRILLING -.
4416 2018-12-31 15:55:01 Is it going to renationalise the oil there?
4417 2018-12-31 15:55:00 Of course! Why not go in for an oil change and find out that like 400 other things need done to my car? Valve cover gasket is shot, which can lead to engine damage if not replaced. Tire has a nail in it, which I luckily bought road hazard on my tires, so that is at least covered.
4418 2018-12-31 15:54:48 @InvestDistr Allow me to play devil's advocate: Oil prices will continue to fall: Any cuts from opec will be more than off set from gains in N. American supply, therefore prices will continue to erode. How to you see this argument?
4419 2018-12-31 15:54:47 Need to get oil in Portland. Any suggestions? Preferably close to union station

4422 2018-12-31 15:54:36 I’m at Toyota of Hollywood getting my oil changed!! Yay me!!
4423 2018-12-31 15:54:30 I would rather be treated like a "second hand citizen" then a walking puppet for coal and oil industry 
Does bitcoin reach out there...yes
Sooo....
4424 2018-12-31 15:54:29 I did get incense and a great oil blend so I can't complain about that.
4425 2018-12-31 15:54:29 well... then oil companies switch products AND CONTINUE 2 EXTORT YOU. would be my guess.
4426 2018-12-31 15:54:23 Why is Saudi Oil exempt from carbon tax?
4427 2018-12-31 15:54:21 Again, oil rich gulf states. With lots of land.
4428 2018-12-31 15:54:16 @MedvedevRussiaE What do you think abducting random US citizens does for tourism?  Not important?  You have a diversified industry base?  Oil AND Gas?
4429 2018-12-31 15:54:14 yes, Dallas Fed tracks energy (oil) for the most part...but this was a huge miss vs. expectations. Biggest 6mo drop since the recession.

Right now I’m launching a brand new team and we’re growing fast. Gratitude
4436 2018-12-31 15:53:25 If he can get oil flowing before the election a lot will be forgotten by many. He legalized marijuana. A huge legacy. In the end, people livelihoods matter more. More than even bad photo ops.

4440 2018-12-31 15:52:57 ok twitter i am desperate for resources on CBD oil and anxiety. as much as i love being stoney, i am shockingly tired of being that way 24/7 to relieve my anxiety/etc.
main questions: -what brands are ‘best’? does brand effect quality?
-what combination of oils (CBD, CBG, etc)
4441 2018-12-31 15:52:53 Coconut oil!!!! Use it while you’re dying your hair!
4442 2018-12-31 15:52:45 If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. What is baby oil made from?

4444 2018-12-31 15:52:09 Clear skin overnight 

•Glycolic peel / pads / toner /
(Evens skin texture and tone, tightens pores, reduces blemishes)
•Tea tree oil/ toner
(Dries out spots, stops oils that break you out)
•Remove makeup properly
(Don’t use makeup wipes, use cleansers, use a spin brush)
4445 2018-12-31 15:52:08 No excess oil, they all look so healthy..

4447 2018-12-31 15:51:59 Because outside the EU, with no freedom of movement, an economic miracle awaits, right? It's just a shame we don't have as much oil as Venezuela.

4472 2018-12-31 15:49:24 Yaaah maybe the progress you refer to is fuel shortage, beer shortage, soft drinks shortage not to mention cooking oil and the like!!! Now it's doctors at one time it was nurses, teachers are on the way. So where is real progress. Money has been in short supply for sometime now
4473 2018-12-31 15:49:17 are they pulling for 20mins? using organic cold-pressed oil? everyone ive known to try this and have stuck to it for a few weeks has seen big improvement and no gross breath. not sure what your peeps are doing but id still recommend it.
4474 2018-12-31 15:49:16 Just a thought but most likely due to operators focusing on oiler basins (Permian/Delaware vs Haynesville/Austin Chalk) along with specifically Delaware wells being much larger oil IPs than their Eagleford predecessors hence more oil prod for the same CMPs.

4480 2018-12-31 15:49:03 I don’t believe anyone ever said stop using oil completely, but merely to reduce the ever increasing prolific waste of it out our tail pipes as we wait in line for a $2.50 coffee at the Timmy’s drive thru. This waste has to stop. Same as single use plastics that end up in ocean.
4481 2018-12-31 15:48:59 All uk debt is backed with North Sea oil ? How do you work that one out ?
4482 2018-12-31 15:48:58 It's out at sea. draw a line on the map. 75% Oil is English. Until splitting wasnt an issue. The mistake Scots make is drawing a horizontal line. Look at Carlisle (lower) to Berwick' (higher). That is a slope. Not Hadrians wall which near Newcastle

4493 2018-12-31 15:47:55 wowowowowo all the author decide to release their fics tonight. got more on the line. im willing to burn the midnight oil

4495 2018-12-31 15:47:50 You realise you're cheering on a team funded by oil..?
4496 2018-12-31 15:47:50 That's seriously disappointing. You realize that beto was #2 to cruz in votes and donations from oil & gas co, right?
And kamala was tough on pot smokers, but didn't prosecute Mnuchin for foreclosure violations. Either your values have changed or you need to do more research.
4497 2018-12-31 15:47:45 Well our Oil has only had 29 years of the 30 year rebuild so we should be patient. #$%!@!!!
4498 2018-12-31 15:47:32 Norway, Sweden, Denmark etc. I didn't say I didn't want capitalism. There has to be a blend of both, and there is everywhere, but it's about finding a fair balance. 

USA just want to control Venezuelan oil, just like they do everywhere else, simply evil.

4514 2018-12-31 15:46:16 But we ended up Allan so that is great.
4515 2018-12-31 15:46:15 

So the republicans are bought off by big oil but @TheDemocrats aren’t?

They work for the people?

4517 2018-12-31 15:46:07 No, actually. I got it from @cenkuygur and @TYTNetwork. He received maxed out contributions from executives in oil and gas companies, and in the current congress, was second to Ted Cruz. Like I said, Beto ran a great campaign for Texas, but he’s not the right guy for 2020 imo.
4518 2018-12-31 15:45:55 Gold started the day strong, oil started the day strong. But both were faded by the State because they only want stocks & bonds to go up. But as we learned from @LukeGromen this is not going to work until you set gold free, and let USD go down. Stocks already starting to fade.

4528 2018-12-31 15:45:17 Use baby oil & gently rub it on the leftover glue with a Q-tip. It’s a life saver :)
4529 2018-12-31 15:45:14 Maybe its just me.. But I have never held hands with any member of my family the way these people are.

Brings to mind the suppression of the hands to prevent signals.
4530 2018-12-31 15:45:08 Prefer argument over insults. So you have water and wind-electric to sell, that's trade. We could just burn coal ~ its still there. Follow the existing sloped border ~ most oil is English.

4532 2018-12-31 15:44:59 Oh my, it seems it was over-deleted and got all shriveled up. *sigh* What else is there to do. Some salt, and pepper, and olive oil, plip-plip-plop

4537 2018-12-31 15:44:29 IMO in and out fries full trash barrel. I always wanted to love them being that they are just potatoes oil and salt... tried so many times. I would put my money on mcdonalds fries winning the blind taste test errtime.

4539 2018-12-31 15:44:26 The same scientists are the used for Global Warming and snake oil sales.
4540 2018-12-31 15:44:23 I will not ruin my New Year’s Eve listening to lies from a snake oil, grifter, conman.
4541 2018-12-31 15:44:23 And you over here being meaningless with no oil change

4544 2018-12-31 15:44:09 Pretty weak day. Not seeing the trade here. An equity run would defy logic as currencies and oil off track. A short into weak volume not worth it. First day of Jan likely another gap up. That’s when the fun starts.
4545 2018-12-31 15:44:03 Internationally the crude oil is at $45 a barrel .in last few weeks a gallon is 50 cent cheaper than last year .how comes Pakistani government is passing only 4 cents to its consumers
4546 2018-12-31 15:44:02 i treat my car like my baby. i’m getting her an oil change and i feel like i’m taking her to a doctor.

4549 2018-12-31 15:43:51 Dude, are you even for real right now? Are you literally wearing your oil and gas donations OVER YOUR EYES?
4550 2018-12-31 15:43:47 I love how you quacks cherry pick  research done on pharmaceuticals—some of which is done by the company itself—that show some drugs are unsafe (and end up being withdrawn), but absolutely refuse to subject their own snake oil to the same rigour, or accept any science on it.

4555 2018-12-31 15:43:35 I got an oil change & paid my ticket AND it’s not even 10am yet
4556 2018-12-31 15:43:35 For the guys we doing our own oil changes, brakes, etc. from 2019 til we retire and teach our friends, sons, cousins, and nephews. Stop wasting money at shops. Get some fuckin tools and learn your car!!

4566 2018-12-31 15:43:00 Think Global Gerald...be a leader! Taxing imported oil and exported coal to primarily China will reduce emissions. We could also, if desired,
make NG more attractive to China to help accelerate global reduction. This would be strong leadership and good for Canada
4567 2018-12-31 15:42:59 Change oil anay before new year HAHAHAHAHAHA
4568 2018-12-31 15:42:51 Yes. I realize that’s hard to see over the piles of money you got from the oil industry. Maybe check with someone who plans on living past 2030?
4569 2018-12-31 15:42:48 thats awesome, but Norway's wealth to fund such projects comes from its oil production. It is ironic.
4570 2018-12-31 15:42:47 It sounds so amazing and delicious-might have to try and make one soon....Crumbled stilton is just gorgeous with olive oil and some warm bread which I have just eaten..

4585 2018-12-31 15:41:53 Yes, and it should be mandatory training. As should changing a wheel, or checking the oil.

4589 2018-12-31 15:41:33 HEM OIL is a Green Alternative that anyone can grow given gov. has the right programs to help small businesses get started. Canada is know for #Farming Hemp with over 50,000 uses from Flour to Oil!
4590 2018-12-31 15:41:33 Dudes are always putting off the doctor until something crappy happens. Gotta remind them that they take their car for an oil change and tune up. Might as well take your body into the shop now and then.
4591 2018-12-31 15:41:32 Lower Oil and weak financials seem like an undesirable “rebalancing of funds”
4592 2018-12-31 15:41:31 @brattykittenxx my pants are on let’s go.
Me we’ll see for how long.
Her Yeah you know what turns me on car maintenance 

Guess I should have done this oil change a while ago 
4593 2018-12-31 15:41:20 Play the tape (or digital file). Trump lied to the American people that Mexico would pay in his usual manner of selling what he could never do. He didn’t create this fake slogan for most Americans, just the demographic gullible enough to buy the snake oil remedy & vote him in.
4594 2018-12-31 15:41:17 gotta go get dis oil change for my car today 
4595 2018-12-31 15:41:14 Me too! Harder to dig a tunnel if you can see through! Just make sure they can't climb it!
Slick it up with oil or something 
4596 2018-12-31 15:41:11 Oil looks ugly this morning
4597 2018-12-31 15:41:08 Black money govt were stuck down by prev MoUs but now u open any swiss ac and govt can take cognigances thanks to the new MoUs with different countries.MSP increased,pandit settlement bill passed,oil prices lowest u consider inflation,Rupay card used in PMJY.$66 in may 14 now 70.
4598 2018-12-31 15:41:07 I avoid buying stuff with palm oil most of the time. But if I can't afford the palm oil free options, and I know others experience that in tighter months, then I think just do what u can. But we should warn new vegans about palm oil more
4599 2018-12-31 15:41:06 Sad people still can’t figure out that Avanati & his ilk are today’s snake oil salesmen. As for honesty - I doubt Avanati knows the definition. I expect a big is what he will get...and it’s what he deserves. He’s scum.

4603 2018-12-31 15:40:57 The Iowa poll results may be indicative of a Democratic electorate looking for an electable candidate for 2020.  Joe Biden might be that candidate-we'll see. Warren jumped in today w her shopworn attack on Big Banks, Big Oil, and Big Insurance, all straight from the 1890s.
4604 2018-12-31 15:40:44 Well said. Some glimmers of hope from (of all places) insurance companies who are taking up premiums and demanding change and grass root movements. A big move on going meat free for some days, and positive change (eg Iceland and Palm oil). One can hope

4611 2018-12-31 15:40:14 The house is plenty big enough... I upgraded the central heating system this year, relocating the oil boiler outside... to make room for this... Just need to change the staircase first... Nothing is simple in a 300 year old house.
4612 2018-12-31 15:40:13 Well I can salvage the cheese at least. I feel like it would work if the oil temperature stays lower, maybe.

Got drunk
Got kicked out of Yale
Married a lady who turned me around
Became the CEO of an oil company
My wife turned out to be Lady MacBeth
Then I became Vice President
Expanded executive power
Turns out I’m a terrible person

4620 2018-12-31 15:39:43 Follow the sloped border line. Are you stealing English North Sea oil? Without full devolution, you guys have been lied to.

4622 2018-12-31 15:39:42 Just thinking about the irony of everything my husband works in the oil field everyone's happy about the low price of gas including us but it also means that oil rigs are shutting down now and people are losing their jobs
4623 2018-12-31 15:39:27 I dont have a car, i live in london and use public transport

The article was talking about effects oil using vechicles has on our society. I was simply highlighting a way of reducing toxic fumes. A policy the govt are behind, just not enough in my opinion.

So dont have a go!
4624 2018-12-31 15:39:26 One of your Oil patch Worker's has opened a Dispensary, maybe you should get a program started to help people transition to HEMP OIL instead. Anyone can grow and give back, you don't need a college education or to be highly intelligent to water plants. Gaddafi had one!  #cndpoli

4626 2018-12-31 15:39:16 Canada must reduce its own emissions, and by carbon accounting rules, this is what is official count. Why would penalize our natural resource exports, just so they go to another country? GHG emissions would not be reduced by a tax on coal or oil exports.

4629 2018-12-31 15:38:53 @ImranKhanPTI govt does not want any relief for poor and middle class. #petrol prices are reduced just Rs 4 when oil price has gone down almost 30 dollars in international market. Ik is a benefactor and protector of corrupt elites n has no concern for middle class n poor
4630 2018-12-31 15:38:38 Hahaha. Probably. They have to be aware the market must move away from oil, eventually.
4631 2018-12-31 15:38:32 GREAT film--as is Bohemian Rhapsody and The Nutcracker & 4 Realms---Also good end to year with UKOG & Alba steaming ahead today.

4636 2018-12-31 15:38:07 :/ moisture!!!!!! Carrot oil with my leave ins has helped tremendously. It doesnt let it frizz like it would if I just put in my leave in. Also castor oil on the ends ha also helped (&& it’s helped it grow)
4637 2018-12-31 15:38:02 See oil on canvass
4638 2018-12-31 15:38:01 Im finna get some beard oil. This baby face life ain’t for me dawg
4639 2018-12-31 15:37:59 Blaming or giving governments credit for oil pricing is delusional. Yes they can influence supply (kind of), but global markets are far more complex than any politician claims. Any other claim is deceptive. #ableg #ucp will strip services though.
4640 2018-12-31 15:37:57 You use the butter in the cooking process.  It's not a lot, and it's mostly to keep the butter from sticking to the pot/cooker.  You can use oil for the same effect.  I've done both, and sometimes oil provides what you are looking for, but butter is on average better.

4644 2018-12-31 15:37:41 Proves my point - they were dragging their feet. Getting in the game late suppressed elecric car sales over the last several years. Oil companies (Exxon) denied climate change same way cigarette companies denied link to cancer? Why? Stalling the conversion to alt.  energy.
4645 2018-12-31 15:37:36 This is paid propaganda, folks. Only useful info here is that oil corps are desperate to cover their asses, and willing to pay  to do it.
4646 2018-12-31 15:37:31 Politeness is the oil of much of society, anyway. And in a liberal society treatment should just not be based on intrinsic birth characteristics, whether sex, skin colour, etc. And race is already self ID and already quite impolite to mention outside political activism.
4647 2018-12-31 15:37:28 Join Pastor Bruce Carpenter New Oil Christian Center COGIC myself and the New Mt Calvary Church tonight @10pm as we bring in the new year. I will be sharing the word of God. 116 E 32nd Street MPLS Mn
4648 2018-12-31 15:37:25 I prefer him over Scheer. Paul, the government bought the pipeline to try and get it built. It hasn't been because any advancements are tied up in the courts. They don't disrespect the oil industry.
4649 2018-12-31 15:37:20 Perhaps peanut butter or coconut oil? Good luck ! 
4650 2018-12-31 15:37:20 creme of nature’s argan oil is really good.
4651 2018-12-31 15:37:17 China uses coal as cheap & abundant energy source. NG far superior store of energy @ cleaner. The IMMEDIATE opportunity to reduce pollution NOW is available to us if we take a GLOBAL view.
Same issue with import of oil via giant diesel tankers across Atlantic.

Absolutely absurd
4652 2018-12-31 15:37:10 赤しいたけ歴3年目に突入してしまった！！
4653 2018-12-31 15:36:58 I have not had good luck with anything coconut oil based, gloves or not. It just doesn’t seem to soak in enough.
4654 2018-12-31 15:36:54 
4655 2018-12-31 15:36:44 I guess if it's the Burt's bees type it sometimes has peppermint oil in it?
4656 2018-12-31 15:36:43 One if the last few days that I can paint before I start my new job and I can’t open my linseed oil because my hands are working less and less. Nothing like a good cry before 8 in the morning as you see your passion moving further away from you.

4659 2018-12-31 15:36:34 People are happy to take all the free information that I provide but....

Anyone who thinks that the President and the Congress of the United States are separate from oil and gas in the United States needs to go back to school. How about Trump's Iran sanctions and price of oil?
4660 2018-12-31 15:36:33 You must keep a load of snake oil in your briefcase. Everything's worse since Trump. He's told 7000 lies just since he was elected. How do you ever sleep?
4661 2018-12-31 15:36:32 I mean sure. But that means it’ll be 2/3 in another three years. 

We could consider just actually teaching history.

4667 2018-12-31 15:36:05 On a stretcher with a severed leg? Or in the waiting room waxing a pleather seat with the keister and nursing a paper cut?

#NewYearsEve #BlowoutSpectacular
4668 2018-12-31 15:36:05 I use the oil every day Ragnar, and usually use the beard wash once every week or so. Love it 
4669 2018-12-31 15:36:01 Only 4.3¢ of the ~45¢ drop is due to the elimination of cap and trade. Prices have fallen mostly because of the drop in global oil markets. Stop trying to overstate the impact of carbon pricing. #ONpoli
4670 2018-12-31 15:35:52 #FakeNews Gas prices are down because of oversupply of oil Have you told you constituents about your assessment of @IPCC_CH climate change WARNINGS Growing concern some politicians acting with wilful blindness #onpoli #Toronto #ForThePeople
4671 2018-12-31 15:35:42 He didn’t. It’s a false narrative created because a number of individuals who happen to work for oil and gas donated. He was running IN TEXAS!
4672 2018-12-31 15:35:36 Does this reduction in petrol prices match the reduction in oil international market? پی ٹی آئ ڈوب مرنے کا مقام ھے  جھوٹے، جھوٹے

4674 2018-12-31 15:35:33 I agree.  His War on Western Canada and the oil industry has affected ALL of Canada's economy and not for the better. 2019 is going to bring that home to many, many people....not just those in Western Canada.
4675 2018-12-31 15:35:30 Do your customers still get a free bottle of snake oil when signing up. 

How did this go last time?

4677 2018-12-31 15:35:21 Tangkad mo na nga eh hope oil!!!!
4678 2018-12-31 15:35:17 Price of oil and the Canadian dollar are historically co-related. Relying on oil and gas also minimizes our economic opportunity. Where is equilibrium?
4679 2018-12-31 15:35:16 your driving lots! to save $600 from gas price now $44/bbl & when oil was $70/bbl you would have to fill up 5X a month on 20 gallon tank.
4680 2018-12-31 15:35:12 Actually he appointed Mattis, and ISIS still had their two major cities and were trading oil. Mattis via Trump changed the strategy and instead of pushing them around, encircled and then annihilated ISIS, taking back both Mosul and Raqqa and every other place they were at.

4684 2018-12-31 15:34:39 What a pathetic government , crude oil at its lowest 45 per barrel and government just reducing petrol of 4Rs, what a joke . Mind it during noon tenure it was 55 per Barrel and petrol price was around 70 . No justification ....

4687 2018-12-31 15:34:30 You like him that’s fine I don’t I never have don’t like anything he does many things he could have done in the fishery and didn’t and to allow a minister to give a clam licence to a family member is alarming amongst many other things also the oil industry to have such disrespect
4688 2018-12-31 15:34:22 Man..  Going to put my chips on Green Bay...  That would be the best disaster. You know Rogers and he would be oil and water.

4694 2018-12-31 15:33:55 Fan service to the Koch brothers and oil execs.
4695 2018-12-31 15:33:53 PC & Science is like oil & water....
4696 2018-12-31 15:33:49 It will be hard for Beto since he’s swimming in “big oil” money
4697 2018-12-31 15:33:40 I used to love a girl. It's not that cliche shit, I knew from the start we weren't gonna last, were too opposite. We had different views, attitudes and personalities. We completely contradicted each other like oil and water. We hated each other's guts
4698 2018-12-31 15:33:34 I think renewables get more subsidies than nuclear because even the gov't knows they're better for the environment. They just can't say that while they're denying climate change & profiting individually off of coal, oil, gas, & nuclear at the expense of our health & welfare.

4704 2018-12-31 15:33:11 Sana oil
4705 2018-12-31 15:33:10 The article was about car makers. As I previously said, they have taken on green energy while the oil comoanies have twiddled their thumbs. There would be charging stations in every gas station by now if they were serious. It’s only now they are getting in the game.
4706 2018-12-31 15:33:06 Saw the video. Glad you're okay and the bike is relatively unscathed. Hopefully the oil leak something simple, too. 
4707 2018-12-31 15:33:05 Gas prices continuing to go down 
Oil is trading at around $45 a barrel. Honestly a perfect buy in if you want to invest into black gold.
4708 2018-12-31 15:33:02 In Syria, US controls territory w/ the rich deposits of the Azar oil fields. Putin has gained exclusive rights to develop Syrian oil and gas reserves. You campaigned on getting out of Syria to repay Putin for his help in your fraudulent election, now you're following through.
4709 2018-12-31 15:33:02 “Yet, in the complex web of biological processes that govern our health, few players ever work in isolation.” This is why Rosita’s COD Liver oil is important it has the 3rd key: Vit A (Retinol) the to Vit A to D is 10:1 ratio as Mother Nature intended it. You need all 3!!!
4710 2018-12-31 15:33:00 Commodities: #Naturalgas -5.36%, #Sugar -2.34%
Top commodity losers are Naturalgas (-5.36%), Sugar (-2.34%) and #Ethanol (-2.15%). Gains are led by #Heating oil (1.69%),Brent (1.26%),Crude Oil (1.06%), #Lead (.96%), #Zinc (.85%), #Lithium (.51%), #Platinum (.46%) #Silver (.26%).
4711 2018-12-31 15:32:57  you’re kidding right? The oil CEO’s are laughing all the way to the bank! They’re still posting billions in profits, while hanging workers out to dry &have milked #Canada of what, 20 billion in tax $$ in 8 months? Maybe they should give each laid off worker 50k instead
4712 2018-12-31 15:32:56 This looks like an oil portrait 10/10
4713 2018-12-31 15:32:55 It's a little like the butterfly effect. Cheaper oil, cheaper gas, cheaper everything associated with them.
4714 2018-12-31 15:32:51 I'm really bothered by elderly men who wear nothing under their leather jacket but baby oil.

4718 2018-12-31 15:32:28 99% of our state governors depend on federal allocation which is tied to rents from oil. They are lazy and have no capacity.
4719 2018-12-31 15:32:21 if you REALLY care you’d stop buying pineapples, coffee, chocolates, diamonds, copper, gold, sugar, bananas, paper, palm oil, as all of that comes from the amazon rainforest which we are struggling to keep from losing. -

4721 2018-12-31 15:32:11 What people back east don't really get is that the majority of work in the oil patch isn't like an ON factory, ie, 80% of the cost isn't sunk in a factory or machines so inertia can carry them through low times. The money's already going to the US while people here lose work.
4722 2018-12-31 15:32:07 I used to think you should have been the CP leader and should be premier. But you're clearly just a liar like Ford, this is a disgraceful untruth you are tweeting. There is no carbon tax that has been eliminated in ON, lower gas prices are due to a current oil glut, nothing else.
4723 2018-12-31 15:31:54 Guess it's time to invest in beard oil for the next 2 months

4727 2018-12-31 15:31:44 Unfair! Didn't you hear him take ownership of the Trump-induced Economic recovery? Didn't you hear him take ownership of low oil prices because of all the "safeguards" he ordered lifted? Come on, he's a genius!
4728 2018-12-31 15:31:44 Under which President did Wall St have record profits, but workers wages stagnated? Under which President was the most US oil & gas production? Which President assassinated a 16 yr old US citizen w/a drone? While the whole time you stood by and did nothing.
4729 2018-12-31 15:31:27 If they can control then they have no issue 1)moving to an oil rig in the middle of nowhere to avoid all kids 2) chemically castration or 3) off thenselves. Face it chief,  NO ONE ON THE PLANET WILL EVER ACCEPT PEDOPHILES!!!

4734 2018-12-31 15:30:41 I didn't say that oil and gas is a gimmick. I said that the idea of replacing coal for LNG is a gimmick to keep us dependent on fossil fuels.

We have to drastically reduce our use of fossil fuels.

4746 2018-12-31 15:29:55 CBD oil if tested for THC.
Sativa strain if no problem with work. 

Someone mentioned before, THC can have a negative impact on anxiety/depression, however, that usually only happens when there is another chemical imbalance in the body or incorrect dosing or improper strain.
4747 2018-12-31 15:29:53 Correct. the Government doesn't buy Saudi oil, Irving Oil does. Irving Oil said they'll continue to buy it even if Energy East is built someday. The Irvings are big CPC contributers. I'd LOVE to see Andy try to force his donors to stop buying Saudi oil... .

4750 2018-12-31 15:29:36 The easy oil is gone and now we think we’re saved by the scraps. How long? Trumps ppl say they don’t care after they are gone.
4751 2018-12-31 15:29:33 Look at the hapless, juvenile, imbecile jugheads in the crowd. Racists having the time of their lives while that snake oil salesman is laughing at their stupidity. They don’t even realize that he’s tossing them red meat so he can steal their wallets.

4757 2018-12-31 15:29:05 I am aware 40 or so years ago the oil industry and the car industry resisted changing to accommodate an electric car line. 

President Obama understood that the foremost way to affect climate change was to electrify the transportation system.  And once electrified a Green source
4758 2018-12-31 15:29:04 Ay bobo oil lang kasi po basahin niyo po yung tweet ko ng maayos ah? Lovelots
4759 2018-12-31 15:28:50 If the only place Alberta can sell its oil is the US they have no reason to pay a reasonable price. They can pay whatever they want. If Alberta wasn’t part of Canada there is no reason for the rest of Canada to let oil through for free. All Alberta has is oil and natural gas
4760 2018-12-31 15:28:50 high oil prices are bad for economy, low oil prices are bad for economy, you want a balance for all to work positive regarding oil and the economy, we are low now oil needs to move back around $55-62 WTIC and stay, $70 is high. Most people arent educated on the economics of oil.
4761 2018-12-31 15:28:49 Crude oil futures for Feb/March mixed Monday morning, $WTI_Crude -0.31% at $45.19 & $NBZ_F +0.26% at $53.35, $USO -0.31% at $9.50 on 12/31/2018.

To hell with our Petroleum Corporations, let them develop our Shale Oil deposits at home and Drill elsewhere that doesn't put
our military in harm's way.
4764 2018-12-31 15:28:22 That’s a stupid comparison & you know it. And if you are invested in oil & gas, there are socially conscious investments you can look at, like cannabis and green energy
4765 2018-12-31 15:28:15 How are these matters not the City of Calgary’s business?? Corporate/business vacancy rates at an all time high in the city in large part b/c of a failing oil and gas industry. Have to try stop the bleeding, so tax shortage doesn’t fall on residential taxation.
4766 2018-12-31 15:28:13 This is bull shit considering tha current oil prices in intl. market
4767 2018-12-31 15:28:04 the fun thing bout body building is coming up with post workout meals and today is: ramen noodles, with two eggs cooked in and a tuna packet. No seasoning from the ramen pack..little bit of spices and olive oil 
4768 2018-12-31 15:28:03 ياشضابه هذا e oil 
4769 2018-12-31 15:28:02 Jahil, there is been a consistent decline of 10% and 8% in the prices of crude oil in international market since October and our very own PTI government has lessened hardly 4 rupees per litre and you want us to appreciate you people on this? Bhai teri meherbani.
4770 2018-12-31 15:27:50 I did tiny pots with a drizzle of oil in the oven. Serve hot, with the pigs in blankets & huge salad. Bliss.
4771 2018-12-31 15:27:48 I hope the oil companies dragging their green feet get left in the dust. They were in the perfect position to capitalize. EV charging stations at their gas stations. Research into new green energy sources. But they were climate deniers and only now are getting into the game.
4772 2018-12-31 15:27:38 Had a dream where my car ran out of oil and instead of putting more in or getting a change, I drank 2 quarts at Walmart and called it good. Now I’m really just confused
4773 2018-12-31 15:27:35 Oh sis I have dry skin in winter. Pure shea butter works the trick after exfoliating and it doesn’t clog your pores like coconut oil 
4774 2018-12-31 15:27:27 The world is funny, if the government finds diamonds or oil in your backyard, it’s government property. But if they find drugs, it’s yours. 
4775 2018-12-31 15:27:17 Can’t see the confusion, a lob is Throw or hit (a ball or missile) in a high arc. While a chip is a piece of potato deep fried in oil or fat or if you are American then a chip is what we Brits call crisp. Simple
4776 2018-12-31 15:27:17 Don’t forget the olive oil.
4777 2018-12-31 15:27:13 新年という事で、名前も「炒飯レイトショウ」から「Oil Sardine Man」にしてみました。
「Oil Sardine（オイルサーディン）」という名前は文字通り、缶詰でお馴染みのイワシの油漬が由来です。ごくたまにご飯に乗っけたり、おつまみで食ったりします。
4778 2018-12-31 15:26:57 Why yes! Yes it is! Did you just arrive? It’s going along swimmingly. Like a well oil(y) machine!
4779 2018-12-31 15:26:51 今年もさきこされた！？？
4780 2018-12-31 15:26:45 I'm considered essential, which is still bad in it's own way.  But regardless, we are all paid today across the board.  No one will miss a penny unless we don't get paid on the 15th.

4782 2018-12-31 15:26:31 Clarifying "baby oil" for him could actually be a kindness.

4786 2018-12-31 15:26:09 Most people would buy snake oil from this confirmed liar.
4787 2018-12-31 15:25:58 The way your car drives after that fresh oil change 
4788 2018-12-31 15:25:57 Apparently letters of intent made in Russia are looked at as a final contract and are held up in that way (according to my super smart lawyer friend who worked in Russia for years for an oil company) she is surprised that none of the reporting is covering this aspect. Thoughts
4789 2018-12-31 15:25:57 open 8-2  come stock up....Angus beef  no hormone chicken..fresh vegetables and fruits  olive oil...chocolate pecans and more...

4793 2018-12-31 15:25:35 Foolish climate denier. No fossil fuels are taxed bc they are exported. All fossil fuels are taxed only for the GHG they produce in processing or being burnt IN CANADA. Again, U are trying to protect your oil investments. The 1% often did bother understanding why cc is a threat

4801 2018-12-31 15:24:57 I’m hoping to see some concerts in 2019.. I just need to get my car up to date with oil change and tires.. anywhere I go is a 4 hr drive. 
4802 2018-12-31 15:24:49 Girl co-worker told me tree tea oil
4803 2018-12-31 15:24:47 Not just oil workers are out of work in Canada. Maybe consider switching from a dying industry that's massively contributing to global warming at a drastic pace. There are other jobs out there if you're ablebodied. Also, co-opting a movement & then changing the message? Not cool.
4804 2018-12-31 15:24:34 Canola oil is actually rapeseed oil but the name was changed in Canada for marketing reasons
4805 2018-12-31 15:24:26 Remove oil from the equation and we will have a population collapse.

4807 2018-12-31 15:24:17 The first fraud I studied was The Great Salad oil Swindle. I was hooked. What inspired this is that I’d done both a $TSLAQ and a $MDXGQ Monopoly painting, and I wanted to do another game, but wanted to highlight multiple frauds on one canvas, not just one.
4808 2018-12-31 15:24:15 Getting an overdue oil change on NYE.  I’ll pay somebody to beat the procrastination out of me in 2019!
4809 2018-12-31 15:24:14 And backed by big oil interests I would bet

4813 2018-12-31 15:23:53 Oil changes are anxiety-inducing. I wish they weren’t.
4814 2018-12-31 15:23:52 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

4819 2018-12-31 15:23:13 What about the 5p plastic bag charge? That has shown to be a failure too. It's had the exact opposite effect, it's made us use more oil/plastic as people end up just using the thicker bags.
Will it get repealed? Will government ever just try more freedom?
4820 2018-12-31 15:23:11 What in the world!!
Is this guy the only politician outside of Alberta that has a clue how this thing is supposed to work? 
Note that he’s not a Liberal ‘school teacher’but an Conservative oil businessman.
I nominate Higgs for President () of Canada.
Does anyone second that??
4821 2018-12-31 15:23:10 idk what the legal situation is right now, but there were a lot of oil leaseholders paying waaaaaaayyyyy less than they should have been on their leases. Osage Nation got a huge settlement.
4822 2018-12-31 15:23:10 Also just the other day, Eric forgot his face oil and he was actually bitching about how tight his face felt and put some on as soon as we got home 
4823 2018-12-31 15:23:10 Who are the little people behind this account? Show us your donor list? Fossil fuel donors all the way. Your small immediate gains are large long term problems we and generations will continue to deal with. Stop being oil & gas  industry shills.
4824 2018-12-31 15:23:02 Head to the mall and get me some more oil, house be smelling real feathery! #TheRayWay
4825 2018-12-31 15:23:00 A baby drinking a large bottle of castor oil would make sense to you.
4826 2018-12-31 15:22:59 C. S. has always been a snake oil salesman. How he sleeps at night is beyond me.

4832 2018-12-31 15:22:26 It may be a good movie, but I would prefer to see an actual reality program of life onboard an oil platform. Sort of a Land and Sea documentary about the offshore.

4834 2018-12-31 15:22:19 Let's agree to disagree on the "all"  part, crude oil is also a commodity and unfortunately it's price wasn't controlled

4836 2018-12-31 15:22:12 This was my point. Easy to install charging stations at gas stations.
Should have already been in advanced stages. Europe has left us in the dust. Oil cos. were so slow to get into the game that the car manufacturers have had to step up which is not in their natural wheelhouse.

And selling snake oil pills.
4840 2018-12-31 15:21:57 ありがとうございます！！！どりーま応援してます！
4841 2018-12-31 15:21:48 It has nothing to do with cap and trade. Gas prices are low in the U.S. Is that because of cap and trade? Oil prices are down that's why they're so low. Use your heads and stop trying to take credit for something that has nothing to do with you. You look stupid! Unbelievable!

4854 2018-12-31 15:20:46 Just made these with olive oil n vegan cheese. Resting in fridge... experiment. Let’s see fingers crossed.
4855 2018-12-31 15:20:39 I just said 5 cents of savings was from dropping cap and trade. Where do I seem to agree no savings?

5 cents to cap and trade, the rest (much larger portion) due to global oil price. CBC on point. PC's taking credit for global economic slow down and resulting lower oil prices.

4859 2018-12-31 15:20:23 You forgot with oil. 
4860 2018-12-31 15:20:21 What do you have against snake oil salesmen @RealJamesWoods ? And using the word “man” in a sentence with this “C” is totally wrong.

4863 2018-12-31 15:20:12 He took ~$400k from oil executives. Even if these are individual donations he should return them because we need the progressive vote. @BetoORourke also voted w/ oil $ interests in the past, rejecting those funds would protect his independence to implement clean energy policies

4890 2018-12-31 15:18:38 Yep it did happen, but that was at the baby oil factory. They have a conveyer belt that leads to the kid juicer...
4891 2018-12-31 15:18:25 Exxon can be dirty but there is nothing anyone one oil company can do to stop battery storage development- no one company is doing the research.

They aren’t the only game and player. They are going towards this because more car companies are discontinuing gas powered cars
4892 2018-12-31 15:18:22 Get back to me when you're willing to put a pipeline through Quebec in Canada's best interest even though the new Premier of Quebec calls it dirty oil.

4896 2018-12-31 15:18:13 It’s good to stabilize oil (energy) prices by efforts from the US administration of keeping the world safe again. Working with longtime allies like #Saudi will make everyone happy. Good job Mr. Trump
4897 2018-12-31 15:18:13 regaluhan niyo naman ako ng oil control film thanks
4898 2018-12-31 15:18:11 That ship sailed. Value of oil tax revenues  have plummeted - partly due to giving tax breaks to industry which the snp took credit for in their last manifesto. We need to start getting real about this. I won’t condemn my children & their future children to even more austerity.
4899 2018-12-31 15:18:06 เสียดายอยากไป แต่พรุ่งนี้ทำงาน

4903 2018-12-31 15:17:35 We all saw the tweets. He got called out. Employees of the oil/gas industry don't need Sirota's, or anyone else's approval that they have the "correct" job to donate to campaigns. Beto isn't my first choice, but we aren't going to put up with sliming.
4904 2018-12-31 15:17:35 Thanks so blending will be key, just assumed light and sweet would produce less fuel oil but middle distillates remain an issue

You can’t wall off the Gulf without killing shrimp fishing, oil and gas producers, cruise industries, etc.  Drugs also come in illegally through commercial transportation for those biz’s.

4930 2018-12-31 15:16:04 Hi Amy. Would you recommend your oil diffuser and oil blend box? I'm looking to get one.
4931 2018-12-31 15:15:51 A snake oil salesmen would say “Dude, what the hell?!’
4932 2018-12-31 15:15:50 what about groundnut oil for frying? 

we've now switched to coconut oil for most south indian cooking.
4933 2018-12-31 15:15:47 Also, from basic market theory:  Its hard to sell people something they do not need or want.   Trump is just a glorified snake oil salesman.  Same as Hanitty and Limbaugh.  Just selling junk to an audience they can easily manipulate..."we luv the poorly educated"....
4934 2018-12-31 15:15:42 They're really excellent when you get the right amount of oil involved

4938 2018-12-31 15:15:31 He DID NOT take fossil fuel money!  I worked on his campaign. He took individual donations from voters in TX, who work for oil companies. His position on fossil fuel is progressive & his knowledge of how to transition the industry is a good plan.

4952 2018-12-31 15:14:20 Last time I checked oil companies purchased oil not government? Am I wrong?

4955 2018-12-31 15:13:48 You need to teach yourself history not propaganda. What was the price of oil when OBJ took over this so called high cost in crude was for how long. Hatred destroys the soul discuss issues based on facts nobody is saying they where no errors you build on them.simple

4957 2018-12-31 15:13:37 True story, but it can be worked out a little more calculatively not so?

Taxes and public service mindset is very very detrimental going forward especially with the hope of some oil money falling in someday

4968 2018-12-31 15:12:15 It has nothing to do with the carbon tax, it has to do with the world price of the oil glut, but keep on with the fake Doug Fraud mantra if it makes you feel smarter Christine!

*because mayonnaise is an abomination that needs to die
4976 2018-12-31 15:11:35 How nice that you are OLD and will die before the ravages of climate change become a permanent daily struggle on planet earth.  But you BE YOU, and live out your last days in high style gorging off of your fossil-fuel industry payola.  Oil$$$ + NRA$$$ = sweet spoils, huh?

4983 2018-12-31 15:11:05  awesome. But will he do any of it on his own? I slowly got him to do daily stuff. 1st was face wash. 2nd was a moisturizer/face oil. Now he asks me about products sometimes. It helps he likes things that smell nice.

4989 2018-12-31 15:10:38 Couldn't agree more. Oil spills shouldn't even be a thing anymore as we should have started moving away from fossil fuels decades ago.

5005 2018-12-31 15:09:23 Do hou know that you come across as an arrogant jerk? Do you know you engage in strawman arguments? Do you understand that because I used Exxon as an example of oil cos. dragging their feet did not mean it is the only oil and gas company dragging its feet?

5021 2018-12-31 15:08:20 Do you cook them whole or cut in half? Do you put anything in the oven dish with them? Oil?
5022 2018-12-31 15:08:17 Please ask about golf cart rental rates.  They are apparently inelastic to the price of oil and out of control. It's like a cartel is in charge.

5025 2018-12-31 15:08:07 Winter gas, and low oil prices. Gas is down everywhere. Nova Scotia has cap and trade and we're 2 cents cheaper.
5026 2018-12-31 15:08:06 What Canadians pay in fossil fuel subsidies? About $3.3 billion for oil and gas producers(Canadian$$). That includes measures like reduced property taxes and special tax deductions for the industry, as well as direct infusions of cash from the government to companies.
5027 2018-12-31 15:07:53 I don't remember them trying to sabotage him and it was probably more theater on their part as well as his -- I consider him totally insincere, so any "FDR talk" was undoubtedly snake oil -- I mean look at 0bamacare, he never even tried for anything else

5054 2018-12-31 15:05:56 Fuxache. GERS assigns the geographical share according to the Kemp / Stephen model so it varies year to year. For the last version, due to decom rebates, Scotland's oil and gas revenue was 111.3% of the UK total

But feel free to dismiss the facts from a position of ignorance

5056 2018-12-31 15:05:37 @MarkHyman Reading a 1988 food mag article about "healthy" cooking. Tips: Use chicken stock instead of oil to saute. Use skim milk instead of milk or cream. Reduced-calorie mayonnaise. Fructose instead of sugar because it's sweeter and you can use less. Have things changed?

5065 2018-12-31 15:04:53 Boss is paying me 11 hours to do his oil change. Which only takes about 20 minutes. 
5066 2018-12-31 15:04:48 
5067 2018-12-31 15:04:48 Canada is being left behind. While we bicker over another oil pipeline the rest of the world is rapidly moving away from fossil fuels
5068 2018-12-31 15:04:37 I went my whole life w/o paying for oil changes and omg my wallet, I’m supposed to do this every 5k miles?

5070 2018-12-31 15:04:28 He’s not comparing oil and cigarettes, but the actions of companies in both industry.
5071 2018-12-31 15:04:25 I miss the days where hard hairstyles, spritz & oil sheen was IN.

..not necessarily the hairstyles, but those were the best times.
5072 2018-12-31 15:04:23 cheaper oil - less associated gas?
5073 2018-12-31 15:04:17 Vintiques will be closed New Yers Day . Re-opening Tuesday 2nd @ 10am...

5152 2018-12-31 14:59:35 Reading a 1988 food mag article about "healthy" cooking. Tips: Use chicken stock instead of oil to saute. Use skim milk instead of milk or cream. Reduced-calorie mayonnaise. Fructose instead of sugar because it's sweeter and you can use less. @KenDBerryMD Have things changed?
5153 2018-12-31 14:59:34 It's a mistake the world needs to get themselves off Saudi oil. The use that revenue to export Wahhabism across the globe.

Try oil paint (I know, I’m stuck in my acrylic habit)

Practice digital art 

Do more art for me 

Less sales online, more vending 

Practice practice practice, I’ll never be perfect but I have so much room for improvement 

What are your goals?
5164 2018-12-31 14:58:24 @ScottsHumor Some data. Russia consumes 3.3 million barrels of oil per day. Texas consumes 1 million P/D & California consumes 650,000 P/D. So Russia consumes twice as much as Texas & California combined. Yet they tell us that Russia's economy is the size of Texas.

5166 2018-12-31 14:58:20 My point was not about the overall future potential of actualizing renewable energy across industries. My point was specific to the disingenuous Exxon PR. One would think that w/the cash & global reach, oil cos, if serious, wld have already put renewable energies on the market.

5183 2018-12-31 14:57:12 Well that's probably because you're a snake oil salesmen and hopefully the mongolids who follow you are too busy producing drool to breed.
5184 2018-12-31 14:57:04 Or because they cook everything in PEANUT oil and I dont want peanut butter burgers . 

Not to mention all  the ppl with food allergies who can never go there

5189 2018-12-31 14:56:52 Not a problem blowhards with no substance or track record don't last long, they move on to sell their snake oil to easier marks. To actually do the research, the leg work, takes effort, it takes no effort to spew nonsense

5208 2018-12-31 14:55:52 It was already a major industry ( then they took the oil money and ditched it - because it was easier and more lucerative ).
Middle and western regions have lots of gold ( locals been extracting by hand for years )

5220 2018-12-31 14:55:14 Usually are.... It's custom made carved stone.... I'm sure they use machines now days to carve, but a lot of ppl die daily, there's a back log AND they do offer payment plans
5221 2018-12-31 14:55:08 They would grapple it into a pit, douse it in oil and burn it, taking swings as it tries to climb out until dead! They wouldn't even determine if it was hostile, because every creature in the arena is just a stepping stone to victory! I'm not proud..well I kindof am! This was fun
5222 2018-12-31 14:55:02 Gee and you are so tolerant in your smugness of believing Universal isn’t possible because you have been indoctrinated into believing that by corporate Dems that are taking money from health, insurance , & oil industries... Progressives are not your problem they are your answer

5229 2018-12-31 14:54:34 Oil or weed to end this year? 
5230 2018-12-31 14:54:28 Since when was “a plan” considered taxing Canadians, claiming they’ll get more back while exempting large emitters and Saudi oil? Seriously, get off your high horse.
5231 2018-12-31 14:54:20 @EmbraceTheCoda Folks got enough oil for the base that I got the Dry dock segment. -10% for all ships post battle.
5232 2018-12-31 14:54:20 One Good News for all....
As per statement from Indian Oil Corporation, a 14.2-kg subsidized LPG cylinder will cost ₹ 494.99 in-spite of ₹ 500.90 currently, in the national capital from midnight.
5233 2018-12-31 14:54:14 So I come into work and we have a new guy. He’s 100% Greek and has a really hard to pronounce name. I obviously didn’t listen to my manager cause I walk up to this guy and say “hi Crisco!” 

CRISCO! Like the oil and shortening. Yup, that’s how my morning is going so far 
5234 2018-12-31 14:54:14 Ok, it's bad, but the people whom complain in LA also drive cars, wear plastics and use many many petroleum products.... sorry for you guys! It is the oil that wrecks you... Come to OZ! NOW
5235 2018-12-31 14:54:13 
5236 2018-12-31 14:54:13 For He has given you the 
    former rain faithfully,
And He will cause the rain 
    to come down for you-
The former rain,
And the latter rain in
     the first month.
The threshing floor shall
     be full of wheat,
And the vats shall overflow 
    with new wine and oil.->

5243 2018-12-31 14:53:39 Trudeau doesn't give a dam about Alberta oil,  or anywhere else in the the country. The liberal party is giving Quebec what  it wants because of the amount of votes.
5244 2018-12-31 14:53:39 I sprayed this Creme Brûlée oil on me after smoking this morning. My managers came in at 7 like “why it smell like syrup back here” whole time, I’m jus happy they don’t smell smoke

5250 2018-12-31 14:52:50 Yes. And it is due to denial from those-including you-who are addicted to oil money and don't have the vision to see how our nation can lead in the development of alternative energy. Sad.
5251 2018-12-31 14:52:43 The ideal environment is not here with us, sadly. Should we put everything on hold, and let oil companies hand oil revenues to some bureaucrats at the energy ministry. Or should Uganda Airlines report to the Minister of Works. China is a good model
5252 2018-12-31 14:52:40 あとでしーじしよ
5253 2018-12-31 14:52:38 Microwave them in a cup. Works every time. No oil needed in the cup. No mess. Low temperature for about a minute and keep checking them. Bob’s your uncle ..... maybe? Hopefully! Good luck

5262 2018-12-31 14:51:47 If an oil company has a rightful claim to property, then they also have a right to defend that claim with lethal force.

If you want to win the argument, don't criticize military contractors, but instead criticize the legitimacy of the claim of an oil company to Nigerian oil.

5268 2018-12-31 14:51:06 How much money did the lobbyist for the oil and coal industries pay you to send this tweet?
5269 2018-12-31 14:51:04 FYI we will be doing oil changes up until 5pm today and closing at 5:30pm. We hope everyone has a safe and Happy New Year!
5270 2018-12-31 14:51:03 Yes, really. 
But I can see why you’d believe your oil donors over those lying, greedy climatologists.
5271 2018-12-31 14:51:02 Try making 10 people rally behind you and then speak. He has the job of rallying 1.2 billion people with 400 million in need of basic requirements. 600 million that require living standards like Christian chor countries and Islamic ones that bore wells of oil!! Have some sense
5272 2018-12-31 14:50:56 ヒッ
5273 2018-12-31 14:50:42 Fair enough but show me how this government had anything to do with that...the price of gas is down everywhere...the price of oil is down...

5276 2018-12-31 14:50:29 Not quite. Some emissions from producer inefficiency (e.g. methane leaks from oil/gas fields during drilling)
(But your basic point is spot on)

5278 2018-12-31 14:50:26 Sorry Richard but Twitter really isn't cut out for long explanations. You should consider frequenting the local library, I'm sure you can find extensive litt. about why coal/oil isn't the way to go forward.

5283 2018-12-31 14:50:13 And when ISIS strike America? When Russian and Iran take control of the oil fields in Syria? When Turkey massacres the Kurds?
5284 2018-12-31 14:49:58 Yes, a decade or two ago would’ve been better. A man tried that by changing his engine to run on vegetable oil and was fined by the oil/ gas industry. The government stood behind that industry. Thanks!
5285 2018-12-31 14:49:54 Suggestions to help hair grow? Other then coconut oil cause I’m already doing that
5286 2018-12-31 14:49:50 Dropped my car off for an oil change and they told me I could wait in the waiting room but I said I was going to walk to Panera.  Lady looked at me like I was crazy Haha,  it's only 15 minute walk though!
5287 2018-12-31 14:49:33 Discussing his voting record is fine. He voted the way his constituents wanted, which is what Reps do, and should be allowed to everyone, not just one guy. Getting donations for oil/gas employees, while in TX, and implying it was something it wasn't, is wrong. See the difference?
5288 2018-12-31 14:49:30 You’re not credible Cornyn. You’re either protecting the interest of big oil or just plain ignorant of basic science.

5296 2018-12-31 14:48:03 It needs to be available now before pills not as last resort, pills are killers, vaping weed/oil is safe - it’s a no brainer once alcohol and pharma lobby groups are ignored. Needs to be available in all forms as well, for some bud is strong enough but concentrates are needed too
5297 2018-12-31 14:48:00 need a 20cent + federal gas tax hike to fund an infrastructure bill.  Trump won't want price of gas/oil to go up until he can get the tax thru

5322 2018-12-31 14:46:14 I’m so thankful that I have a stash of essential oils. I woke up with a cold this morning, and a few minutes in a steamy shower and some eucalyptus oil. I feel great, and can actually breathe

5324 2018-12-31 14:46:05 The Bush administration made its bed with the Saudis and laid in it. They couldn't be bothered to worry about the consequences, too much oil to acquire.

5339 2018-12-31 14:44:47 Life isn’t fair. I don’t care about that. No one would if the economy was really doing good. The real issue is the dollar. The cost of oil needs to be over 60-70 bucks and the economy roars. That’s all we need.

5362 2018-12-31 14:42:57 Got my oil changed this morning. They gave me the wrong paperwork and car keys. I was wondering why it was so expensive. They gave me full refund and didn’t charge me for mine. Good way to start the end of the year 
5363 2018-12-31 14:42:55 Not sure what PM is but he has abrogated Alberta’s Constitutional right to move its oil to export position at a deep water port - something he has no right to do as Prime Minister. If he is not upholding our Constitution we have a real serious problem in this Country.

5375 2018-12-31 14:41:47 Well, it's a shame that a 5th generation, privately held company, 113 years old, folded all because of protests against pipelines. 
Moving oil or gas on rail cars is a big mistake.

5380 2018-12-31 14:41:27 Instead of waiting for the idiot base of deplorables to abandon Trump, the GOP senators & congressmen should grow some balls and appeal to the 88% of the country who are appalled by him. The voters don’t move them, the big paychecks from Koch, NRA, oil&gas, pharma & others Do.

5384 2018-12-31 14:40:39 Dude! Wake up and smell the petrol fumes. You can take credit for an initial drop in gas prices, but not the most recent ones. The cost of crude oil has been dropping. Shake your head, your eyes are stuck.
5385 2018-12-31 14:40:39 I was told that story while I was waiting at that mechanic shop.

Two girls were waiting for an oil change and tune up so they could begin their road trip to Cabo San Lucas.

They were trying to make me jealous of the fun they were having, but I don't think that way.

5401 2018-12-31 14:38:55 The big point to note is goverments state and central earn a considerable amount in petrol ,diesel sales by way of taxes  so even though the crude oil prices decrease internationally the price of petrol and diesel won't come down beyond a certain point .

But they were 'right wing', 'deniers' and 'funded by big oil'. So they were wrong.

5446 2018-12-31 14:34:29 Yeah its the Green Team, who want the world  using resuables and REDUCE our reliance on oil, who are funding the Saudi coffers.  Makes perfect sense. Remove your tin foil fat when you shut the door....
5447 2018-12-31 14:34:25 Hi Angel. Since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources.
5448 2018-12-31 14:34:24 Tomato ke?

5451 2018-12-31 14:34:05 Because he’s a hypocritical snake oil salesman!  He thinks he’s so special with his red glasses on his nose.
5452 2018-12-31 14:34:04 Upscaling is not easy and economy of scale does not apply here. Cost is the issue. UK’s NHS is failing. Norway, the 2nd largest oil exporter in the world, funds their healthcare through government ownership of their oil industry. What do you propose for the US to cover costs?

5463 2018-12-31 14:32:39 Where do you buy the oil?
5464 2018-12-31 14:32:28 When cap and trade went into effect in Ontario, most reports estimated that the result would be in the 4.5 cent per litre range. In 2017, prices did go up.  One would estimate that once fully un-wound, prices will go down. I propose this is small vs change of world oil price.

5485 2018-12-31 14:30:47 It really isn’t. Big oil has spent a lot of money making people believe the cause is questioned in science, but it isn’t. In the name of fairness we have said, ignorance equals a lifetime of study. It’s time for that to stop. America should be leading, not pandering to big oil.

5487 2018-12-31 14:30:37 Btw, the new Permian pipelines will become operational next year, ending the bottleneck and doubling output.  Texas is already expanding refinery and storage capacity in anticipation.  Oil may drop below $50 per bbl and gas, $1.50 per gal.  So good luck with that Green New Deal.

5500 2018-12-31 14:29:26 Green Crusaders:  Oil companies are evil, never trust them.

Oil Companies:  We believe climate change is a real threat, and so long as the retail consumer is paying the bill, we support carbon taxes.

Green Crusaders:  Listen to the oil companies, they understand!

Not because I earned it or deserve it, but because God is so GOOD, and we both know that without Him, I would be so lost

5517 2018-12-31 14:28:13 So why are the prices equally low in provinces with a carbon tax?  Because the global price of oil is low. Doug has nothing to do with that. And you never removed the tax. It was never there in the first place, it had not yet been put in place.
5518 2018-12-31 14:28:08 Think of Warren as an absorbent oil barrier and her bid as drawing out more dark Republican thoughts/speeches/bytes (has Trump ever mentioned her before?) that will help Democrats in general. She is acting as a foil.

When I contest your argument you just abandon it and go in another made up farsicle attack.
Common sense is we need air to breath and water to drink, not pollute the entire world with oil & coal, that’s the current choice.

5535 2018-12-31 14:26:49 Its interesting you guys put up the oil research, because I was explaining this to someone earlier: The lifespan of oil and it being the NUMBER ONE used commodity in the world (silver being #2), and how oil was instrumental in the industrial revolution.

5587 2018-12-31 14:22:58 The thing with oil cleansing is that for it to be really effective you have to use the right combination of oils for your skin type & you have to take the oil off with a steaming hot wet towel.

Your argument has no merit. We all rely on oil, yes, and it has to change, that’s the point,Topics a little above your pay grade clearly.

Just because world has been made to accept oil &rely nearly 100% on, doesent mean it’s the right way to move forward. We all rely on oil today, it’s not the point & it’s not an argument.

5645 2018-12-31 14:18:41 for anyone making a new year's resolution to eat healthier or lose weight, 2 things that worked for me:

1. find a salad dressing you really like (mine is Newman's Own Olive Oil & Vinegar). having a delicious salad dressing will make you actually want to eat the leafs
5646 2018-12-31 14:18:30 Yes, that will be why even oil companies are investing in alternative energy

5651 2018-12-31 14:18:15 Well, I was told it was going to be a tropical rainforest... 

There was, however, a not turtle-sized space between the tile bench and the glass wall.   Despite being too small, I got in easy-peasy.

Getting me out took a whole bottle of olive oil.   It was very stressful.

5654 2018-12-31 14:17:53 My dad, when he changed the oil in his car, would dump the old oil behind our garage. THAT was pretty awful, though, he likely didn't know better. He didn't know there were places to take used oil back then. That or perhaps he was just too cheap... Sadly, that is also possible...
5655 2018-12-31 14:17:50 This deceptive gibberish only @tictoc would post. Mondelez cookies represent a tiny fraction of world palm oil production with that product going to biodiesel, pizzas, lipstick and hundreds of other items. Palm oil deforestation is a travesty, blaming Oreos is absurd.

5773 2018-12-31 14:08:46 You are deluded. Cap & Trade added about 4 cents per litre. Price has dropped by over 25 cents per litre due mostly to world oil price decline. You know that so you are being deceitful.

5795 2018-12-31 14:07:11 This is one of my favorite Golic Sr moments and what a Sr moment. Oh and Jr, it's far more REALISTIC for oil drillers to go up to an asteroid & drill than a fish man n human woman dancing in bathroom filled w/water. Neither are likely but I'd bet on oil long b4 Mr fish dancing!

5813 2018-12-31 14:05:32 Try CBD oil or a lotion for it. It helps with my arthritis so I think it can help you! My friend had the same problem with 5 kids and she tried it (the lotion) and it worked! Of course you’ll have to apply it when it hurts but it works!
5814 2018-12-31 14:05:28 Seriously @fordnation stop with the propaganda. Even elementary students can see through this BS. What instructions circulated through the party?

5815 2018-12-31 14:05:25 This tweet is unacceptable, we are more than oil/pipelines. I will never, ever give up on Canada. But you are unacceptable with the divisive, negative tweets that you insist on sharing. I have waited for you to do better, but you can't. #WeakAndy

5835 2018-12-31 14:03:24 No but I screwed up my liver. I have been using fake olive oil that has brought my liver down & my liver has made more stones then ever & really on the verge of cirrhosis from olive oil that promoted a fatty liver.  In order for my liver to heal I have to be vegan for some time.
5836 2018-12-31 14:03:19 Looks like we’re getting mean reversion on the oil names as they were just market sold (prob to make 2018 YE look “pretty”), some funds blew up. Waiting for some new ones to be added could pop various names imo

5860 2018-12-31 14:01:43 The Fed/Treasury new ZOPP (zero oil price policy) is thinly veiled and another attempt to rescue a fragile economy that a slight uptick in rates has shaken. Oil is now .068 cents a cup (much cheaper than bottled water) and one on the truly great opportunities going into 2019 imho

5870 2018-12-31 14:01:13 Coconut oil. I would get a fine tooth comb, some coconut oil, massage the coconut oil onto her scalp, then gently use the comb to get all that dry skin off. That worked well with my daughter!
5871 2018-12-31 14:01:13 That's true! I don't have much experience with Turkish cuisine but reckon it is very similar. Oo yes! Highlanders make pasta, dumplings and eat apricot oil with buckwheat. Mate, I would love to make Chitrali cuisine as necessity in my life.

5926 2018-12-31 13:56:15 You can apply (with a q-tip or lash spoolie ):
- Vaseline 
- coconut oil
- caster oil
- olive oil
- vitamin e oil
- contact solution ( I have heard it works but I haven’t tried it )
5927 2018-12-31 13:56:00 That's a comprehensive list of banking, oil and big pharma bootlickers.
5928 2018-12-31 13:55:58 Sepah pasdaran owns Oil fields besides construction engineering companies a varsity Mustafeen and Shaheed foundation alone has a budget of several billion . Israel lo and behold every El Al pilot  flies for the Israeli air force IDF has hi tech companies .
5929 2018-12-31 13:55:36 Going to be very difficult with Rep control of the Senate and the specter of another Trump Sct justice and record # of appellate and district court confirmations. And try prying oil companies out of ANWR once they drill. The industrial infrastructure will be catastrophic.
5930 2018-12-31 13:55:35 It's OUR oil our resources NOT the US governments. Ours. America wake up really look at Saudi and how they live we are now the Second largest exporter of Oil we are.  America is.  Did you hear what I am saying? Look at the Alaskan pipeline America pays Alaskan every year for oil

5936 2018-12-31 13:54:44 The Fed/Treasury new ZOPP (zero oil price policy) is thinly veiled and another attempt to rescue a fragile economy that a slight uptick in rates has shaken. Oil is now .068 cents a cup (much cheaper than bottled water) and one on the truly great opportunities going into 2019 imho
5937 2018-12-31 13:54:41 Spurs are competing against an oil state and two of the richest clubs in the world and one backed by Russian money. Would have won the league long before now if it wasn’t for such financial doping.

5946 2018-12-31 13:53:47 If government blames market situations for price increase by oil companies, why does it want credit for price reduction by oil companies?

5958 2018-12-31 13:52:55 President Buhari rejected the #PIGB which will reform the Oil industry and make Nigerians enjoy the dividends of our wealth as a nation because he wants to retain the power to give out oil blocks. We have to demand an #OpenOilLicense and call on the President to #SignPIGBNow
5959 2018-12-31 13:52:50 Didn't he get fired for having that in his office?
5960 2018-12-31 13:52:48 Nuclear and burning wood, coal, oil is not the sollution, it's the problem.
Solar, wind, biogas and batteries. If you really want hughe steps forward in innovation than you don't invest in the wrong thing and use that money for the right things.
5961 2018-12-31 13:52:28 Up too early this New Year's Eve to get an oil change. No other slot was available and it's overdue. #nofun

5969 2018-12-31 13:51:46 $NAT gains 200% in first half of 2019.  Gains in all oil tanker stocks result from unrest in Middle East since US hands Syria over to Iran.  OPEC is ineffective at turning off tap but oil prices rise anyhow!

6008 2018-12-31 13:48:11 I think ripple trying to take over the Middle East is a positive sign for possibilities with oil business. That will be huge
6009 2018-12-31 13:47:57 I assume you mean the associated gas. I don't think that's a significant factor yet. Mostly just a lot of gas is produced with the volatile oil in Permian and Eagle Ford.

6049 2018-12-31 13:44:12 Ah, I would buy snake oil before I would buy the crapola he is peddling. And, I like snakes, they keep the critters away from my garden so not buying either.
6050 2018-12-31 13:44:07 Liar. This is NOT happening because of your government scraping Cap and Trade, it’s because OIL PRICES are low from over supply. We are not stupid.

6070 2018-12-31 13:42:46 100% complete FALSE. I was there before, during, and after. Those airstrikes weren't working and the reason for the surge returning to Iraq in '14-15. It didnt cripple them and it damn sure didnt defeat them while they continued to advance and sell black oil making millions!
6071 2018-12-31 13:42:41 おもったｗ

6072 2018-12-31 13:42:37 Solar has been pushed into the ground with regulations while oil is given huge subsidies. Capitalism does not work, and your free market is not existent. Go do your homework and talk to me when you can make sense,.

6075 2018-12-31 13:42:21 Where is your integrity?  Watching good people lie for Ford makes me ill.  Gas prices are down because oil prices have crashed.  Alberta has a carbon tax an NDP government and Lower gas prices than Ontario.
6076 2018-12-31 13:42:19 You know, we hear a lot about how harmful palm oil is to cultivate, but I haven’t heard a peep about the many virgins we lose each year to coconut and olive oil production. Double standards, smh
6077 2018-12-31 13:42:07 あー、めっちゃよねよねしてきた
6078 2018-12-31 13:42:06 I can’t wait to run my BITCH a shower ,  pour oil all over the floor .. Then beat HER w/ a belt . Okay Periodt..

Sure, I’ll hold...
6081 2018-12-31 13:41:48 The petrocoin is using xrapid. Mufg subsidary company is using  ripple for petrochemical products. Vakt we suspect.  Do you think there will be a common ground?  Or a standard in the oil industry?
6082 2018-12-31 13:41:48 I woke up so early to get an oil change.  Come to find out i don’t even need it yet. 
6083 2018-12-31 13:41:44 Stumbled upon the cooking channel and a bitch put truffle oil in the potato salad

6090 2018-12-31 13:41:14 What about all the oil, coal, and gas worker’s girlfriends and dogs?  Since when does Josh Fox care about jobs?
6091 2018-12-31 13:41:07 I was indeed serious that the price at the pump is multifactorial and that we should be addressing the oil crisis as a national issue.
6092 2018-12-31 13:41:04 For me, I’ve found that edibles make my anxiety higher. Indicas make me extremely sleepy and relaxed. Sativas make my mind race. THC oil w high concentrations ease my anxiety the most. Also, smoke smaller amounts. A blunt isn’t for everyone.
6093 2018-12-31 13:40:59 さすがのんもくん！笑
6094 2018-12-31 13:40:56 Was up until 3 a.m and up at 8 because I need a god damn oil change because I’m already so over my mileage.... #notmybestchoice
6095 2018-12-31 13:40:27 thanks, oil will be one to watch close turn of the year :)

6097 2018-12-31 13:40:18 Depending on your tastes, I like a good fried mushroom sandwich - plenty of oil, salt and black pepper? And a clove of garlic for the sake of it!
6098 2018-12-31 13:40:16 Buhari's administration try hard to invest in infrastructure development in spite of low ebb earnings from oil compare the oil bumming era   of 16 years pindipin administration

6102 2018-12-31 13:40:01 Yeah that’s not going to happen. The oil and gas companies want all the money they can get before the tape is turned off, they are not going to close the door to any consumer.
6103 2018-12-31 13:40:00 ただ、シャブが切れた頃にやってくる賢者タイムという難点がある 正気に戻ってはいけない………
6104 2018-12-31 13:39:55 Ya great idea. Get back to work on ripping up the earth for the dirty, expensive oil for which there is a plummeting demand. Let's continue the tax-payer funded destruction of the planet.
6105 2018-12-31 13:39:52 You corrupt dirty politicians I have sold your snake oil to the American people for a long time. But God has a different plan it’s called exposing the truth! And now it’s time to reap what you have sown.
6106 2018-12-31 13:39:42 なんで言わなかったの....
6107 2018-12-31 13:39:39 はーやーいー笑
6108 2018-12-31 13:39:33 Yeah...that’s not going to work at that temp. Needs to be a minimum of 450 F and you want to get most of the oil off before you put it in heat. Seasoning is built up one micro-layer at a time. You’re right about the smoke as well! I’ve made that mistake!
6109 2018-12-31 13:39:08 Capitalism working so well for oil and gas (federal subsidies), agriculture (subsidies and bailouts) and auto industry (bailouts, except Ford). All industries impacted by climate change. The fair market is a farce, so let’s not use it to deny science, ok?
6110 2018-12-31 13:38:46 Thanks Stephen for destroying our country with dirty pipelines carrying dirty Alberta oil. Great achievement!

GOLDMAN SACHS has bragged to BLOOMBERG TV about raising gas/heating oil in January? Bend over America here comes GOLDMAN SACHS?
6127 2018-12-31 13:36:33 Shareholders & Corporations also have a hand to play. When they grow palm for palm oil the indigenous land is taken over & no food crops are grown. Then they end up here

6129 2018-12-31 13:36:24 Do oil companies influence the nation by broadcasting selective information? NOPE!!!! Bad comparison but nice try.

6138 2018-12-31 13:35:06 Among your dumbest takes ever. The reason there isn’t progress is because the oil and gas industry absolutely owns most of Congress, Dems and Repub. The science is undeniable. The facts are indisputable. This comes down to campaign money and influence. But sure, blame the victims

6143 2018-12-31 13:34:31 Make better choices in choosing representatives. The big $ companies make non-enviro options too easy. Oil&gas strongholds, shipping products, animal factories, etc. I've noticed people choose convenience over 'long-term' risk. Gov't must direct, instead of selling out/lobbying.
6144 2018-12-31 13:34:26 This response is full of lies that you should be ashamed to perpetuate as an elected official. You know perfectly well that's not how equalization works and that we now import almost no Saudi oil.

6150 2018-12-31 13:33:44 Good question! All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana and cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.
6151 2018-12-31 13:33:41 Just saw an oil truck pull into a church. God can’t heat the church himself? Wierd. Almost like he don’t exist and it’s up to humans to do our own shit. Very weird
6152 2018-12-31 13:33:17 You got your chance & you blew it . You allowed the pro-Union crowd to bluff & lie their way through referendum. Like lambs to the slaughter , u allowed currency, defence & oil ownership to be key factors in deciding how to cast vote

6159 2018-12-31 13:32:32 Alberta has 100+years of reserves. Oil will be replaced by technology. In the meantime, it's idiotic to leave Alberta oil in the ground while burning oil shipped from Saudi Arabia

6164 2018-12-31 13:32:10 You guys are so delusional. There is a worldwide oil glut on the market. That is why prices are low. Nothing to do with Ontario government. Are your supporters really that dense?
6165 2018-12-31 13:32:10 In 1900 science was also settled. Any scientist who says science is settled, is a snake oil salesman. BTW, who exactly has a degree in "Climate Science" that is in Congress or works in Hollywood?
6166 2018-12-31 13:32:05 I feel far more threatened by the open carry mall cop fondling his gun while I get my oil changed than undocumented immigrants.

6172 2018-12-31 13:31:43 The silent majority of CDNs know that Canada can be a global market leader in safe and ethical oil exports, and we each have 1 vote to use to kick these globalists to the curb and finally stomp Liberalism out of existence at the Federal level in this country next year,

6196 2018-12-31 13:29:07 Lmfao, new technology is already rising that in the next 10-20yr oil will be a thing of the past. Let Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the middle east handle their business. I mean what do people expect, for us to stay there for 200yr? Middle east region has been at war for centuries.

恋人の郷ひろみもだし…
6204 2018-12-31 13:28:18 Thanks. I know my limits, so getting four to six books published a year is still a great goal for me to accomplish. From what I understand now, there's different variants of CBD oil, so maybe having it regulated might be a good idea. Course, my body is weird, so it reacted 1/2
6205 2018-12-31 13:28:09 Why is shirt greased with oil were u fixing the trucks.?
6206 2018-12-31 13:27:40 ส่งท้ายปีเก่าต้อนรับปีใหม่กันจร้าThank GoD
6207 2018-12-31 13:27:40 If you’re busty then last last use household double sided tape (but if the material of the cloth is thin the outline will show sha)... but use oil to remove so it doesn’t hurt 
6208 2018-12-31 13:27:39 Petroleum? Oil?
6209 2018-12-31 13:27:36 The funny part is that “big oil” is completely in the climate change bag.  They stand to make tens of billions being paid for old field tertiary recovery projects as “carbon sequestration”. They also are the biggest investors in green energy.
6210 2018-12-31 13:27:36 ねーーー！ちょっと悲しい(´；ω；`)ｳｩｩ

6212 2018-12-31 13:27:25 I've seen a lot of cases where the speaker hole is filled with ear and face oil. If you get an alcohol swab and rub it in there it should fix it.

because generator usage.. increases the usage of fuel.. which in turn increases the sale of crude oil ..which in turn increases the money in their pockets

6217 2018-12-31 13:26:54 KJ. Tak masuk akal-lah. Budak2 Std 3 pun tahu. How can we be overpaying when gov't is paying RM 12billion/yr subsidy JUST SO WE CAN DRIVE. W/out subsidy oil coy lose $ with every liter they sell; might as well close shop! At mkt rate (no subdy) price of RON95 will be RM8to10/lt.
6218 2018-12-31 13:26:53 Congrats! I’m only a horse, but would a drop in WTI oil from $75 to $45 over the past 3 months be a factor? Aside from the fact that gas prices are still a rip off. Keep up the great work though, and when you get a sec take a look at personal tax rates.

6229 2018-12-31 13:25:48 No waterfall off the bridge though? I love this city bury without the waterfall I don’t know how to start the first day in the new year without it...do I have toast in the morning or eat nails and drink oil? Nothing makes sense!

6232 2018-12-31 13:25:34 People with actual experience and knowledge have warned against this.   There will be more extremists, more refugees,  and more than likely, a loss of oil rights.   But your narcissistic urges have to put everyone in danger.
6233 2018-12-31 13:25:26 Put coconut oil on it
6234 2018-12-31 13:25:26 When do you apply sunscreen? After applying the oil or before the oil?
6235 2018-12-31 13:25:05 That’s our oil we paid to extract it plus it’s almost gone anyway. The English don’t want you staying we couldn’t careless my educations cost me 25k I wouldve got it free if I was Scottish and now I have to work to pay for even more Scottish kids to get it for free
6236 2018-12-31 13:25:03 They are INCREDIBLE and the oil that you can dump out at the end is so satisfying. The food just tastes healthier too
6237 2018-12-31 13:25:01 Well you cannot have a stable currency that is so tied to the instability of oil.

6241 2018-12-31 13:24:20 Oil prices are set to sky rocket soon. Gas prices will be higher than ever in 2019. Will you take credit for that too when it happens? Stop lying.

6247 2018-12-31 13:24:02 Congrats about the books published. I love reading stories like that. I've heard mixed things about CBD oil, I'm hoping once full legalization comes we'll get full medical research and not the hit and miss it seems to be. Hope your 2019 is a great year and thanks for sharing

6264 2018-12-31 13:22:23 So all those people at rallies shouting "Mexico" did not really care? They really believed @realDonaldTrump could do it. He is a snake oil salesman.
6265 2018-12-31 13:22:14 I eat right, drink lots of water, use only coconut oil on my skin, yet over the last few months my face has broke out like it never did in my life.

6266 2018-12-31 13:22:05 Oh, please! More crap on Soros? No mention of the fact that many more pro-Trump billionaires and corporations (big oil) have added to their enormous wealth by virtue of deregulation and corporate welfare! Leave Soros alone!!
6267 2018-12-31 13:22:02 Awesome.  

We are energy independent and don’t need Middle East oil. 

We need to get the hell out of the sandbox.

6271 2018-12-31 13:21:22 Whether this is politically motivated or not, I just hope the sale would at least add to the GDP and help finance the budget deficit since oil prices have fallen below the benchmark. The same gesture should be extended to others (in good faith) whether politically exposed or not.

6283 2018-12-31 13:20:25 I made it through another year w/o having to be operated on or having a stone pulled out of me. So woot. A mishap with CBD oil did send me to the ER for a bit, so lesson learned. No more CBD oil. I published four/five books this year, growing my income.
6284 2018-12-31 13:20:17 Wonder if @StateFarm policy includes language about collection information about driver from 3rd parties. Wonder if oil change service agreement or receipt that customer signs includes language about selling of customer information to 3rd parties. #privacy #disclosure
6285 2018-12-31 13:20:14 Iran was not in sight in 1941. Largest oil fields known at the time was Indonesia. Thus the toppling of Dutch colonial government. Pearl Harbor was planned to deny the US pacific fleets to hinder the Indonesian campaign.

PS: Stop whining.

Minyak kayu putih yg asli jarang dijual krn mahal dan panas bgt. Yg ada dipasaran biasanya sdh di"encerkan" dgn minyak kelapa atau lainnya. Bisa cek di komposisi

6356 2018-12-31 13:14:50 And instead of reinvesting oil wealth into the development of new industry, we threw it into a giant trust fund to give away money each year, making it the third rail of Alaska politics.

6372 2018-12-31 13:13:32 Trudeau sold all of Canada’s gold and destroyed their Oil industry. It’s only a matter of time before Canada goes under. Watch out for a huge recession in 2019
6373 2018-12-31 13:13:31 Ireland is even worse. We don't even have a HEMA with any kinda of Dutch treats. I might make some tonight myself, but I first have to conquer the oil fear. Luckily I am going back in only 3 weeks and by that time the local stall might still be out.

6383 2018-12-31 13:12:52 I don't need to insult you to prove a point.

Offering and tithe as you mentioned are voluntarily. School fees and all are voluntarily if you want education.

But tax, duties and levies are mandatory.

Oil revenues and all goes to the government.

6410 2018-12-31 13:10:18 He’s trying to promote his work he wants it to be seen he wants to get the word out there. So great to see traditional skills of oil painting applied to fantasy art in these days of computer wizardry

6417 2018-12-31 13:09:49 the tiny jar of extract got mixed with vegetable oil and loaded into a spray bottle as homemade pepper spray...but I still have...
6418 2018-12-31 13:09:47 We were also fooled by something that wasn’t the actual oil level. Ended up climbing through the hedge in the dark with a dip stick to check (stick almost not long enough to find the inch of oil!) 
Next job... figuring out how to check how much gas we have for cooking.
6419 2018-12-31 13:09:35 get some cannabis oil on it.

6496 2018-12-31 13:02:33 so many indian meals are actually vegan.. For example daal, chawal, sabzee, roti, salad..provided you don't take ghee or dahi with the food & food is cooked in oil not ghee.

6498 2018-12-31 13:02:25 I found the products and routine that work for my hair I’m not about to keep adding anything. For example tried coconut oil for a month one time. Dried my hair and Broke it off sooooo bad that I had to cut it above my shoulders. Learned my lesson.

6508 2018-12-31 13:01:33 FGN must be really optimistic to benchmark crude oil at $60pb, for most part of 2019 we forecast crude to sell below $60 with an average price of about $55 for the year, hence lesser revenue, more borrowing and hawish stance on fixed income rates.

6523 2018-12-31 13:00:37 The FED should not ease monetary policy direction because the US government meddles constantly in the Middle East and destroys oil prices on whim. 

Keep rates high, keep the dollar strong, keep oil prices low. Let the savings of US consumers buy more oil than ever.

6526 2018-12-31 13:00:06 A quote for today:

"It's not just a boring exercise in pushing oil paint around a canvas. It's a way of opening a threshold to an exciting new world of vision."
—Nelson Shanks
6527 2018-12-31 13:00:04 While I believe in conservation to a degree, I would respectfully disagree on limiting oil usage in other areas.  As you well know, most plastics are oil-based derivatives.  Many electrical generation & manufacturing needs can only be solved by energy dense substances, i.e. - oil
6528 2018-12-31 13:00:00 First generation #biofuels (bio-ethanol and bio-diesel) are made from sugar, starch and vegetable oils (edible and non-edible) and hence refer to those feedstocks within the food cycle, e.g. maize grain, palm oil, rapeseed etc. using conventional technology.

Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.
6573 2018-12-31 12:56:09 Take a look too at 2yr TIPs vs real 5s, 10s & 30s, esp since Sep FOMC. Oil rinse and consequent disinflationary impulse manifesting big in 2s, barely at all in deferred TIPs curve. Inflation narrative on the back burner, Fed pause apt to change that.

6627 2018-12-31 12:50:33 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
6628 2018-12-31 12:50:32 Head in the sand Eddie. They always ignore any wrong doing by their club. It's why the snake oil salesman types that run it get away with the things they do. It's stunning that they demand respect for a minutes silence, yet deny the club was responsible 
6629 2018-12-31 12:50:32 I think palm oil is a very debatable issue but I deffo understand why people struggle or have a lack of understanding of it! I’m still not completely in the know
6630 2018-12-31 12:50:26 Never heard of that friction at all. Bernie doesn’t take big oil money. I don’t see friction. I just see one candidate being bought, and one not being bought.
6631 2018-12-31 12:50:25 Дада, я тоже этим займусь.

6642 2018-12-31 12:48:45 It makes 100% sense. Cyprus has sun and wind. Oil&Gas must be imported. Cyprus should go 100% self supplied with energy and fresh water (desalination plants). Create value domestically!
6643 2018-12-31 12:48:39 えっ、、なんで！！
6644 2018-12-31 12:48:39 So the east takes their oil from the middle East and we sit on the 3rd largest reserve on the planet.....and you say that it's oil companies that are the problem.....might be the pipeline that the east doesn't want.....as for any other problems that you perceive..that's on you

6661 2018-12-31 12:46:43 During 2016, we came up with 14 ways to pay for the Border Wall. 
One way was to tax remittances to Mexico, which are now more than 28billion and greater than income from Mexico's Oil Sector. 
Great, I say to Senator Tester, let's tax remittances to Mexico. 
Vote for it!

Let's deal with some ACTUAL facts shall we?
First FACT, you're not a "doctor", you're a purveyor of snake oil and a fraud.
Second FACT, the human body is equipped with its own detox systems, so there is no need for Nadia's (or any other) fraudulent "detox"  juice.

6741 2018-12-31 12:36:59 Oh, I have some nice bread recipes as well.

It's using coarse semolina wheat flour, water, salt, and no-oil or some/oil to keep with the Biblical recipe that makes for some tough eating!

I'll stick to my usual 70% fine whole wheat flour for puffier bread!

6762 2018-12-31 12:34:19 vape oil. Please I must see
6763 2018-12-31 12:34:14 Go & Check on none oil revenue allocation sharing and stop confusing yourself. Not every arguments is about buhari.
6764 2018-12-31 12:33:48 M 6+1 addressed the nation already? What did he say about locally made cars and oil. I missed all 3 things in 2018
6765 2018-12-31 12:33:46 Jobs can be and are created in the growing green economy. The oil and gas companies know there is a change and have already started switching to renewable energy. Things change. That's the way it is and everyone knows that now.
6766 2018-12-31 12:33:42 One must avoid sleeping during the day, eating in another’s home,eating more than once,having physical relations,eating honey,eating from a bell-metal plate,eating urad-dal,rubbing oil on one’s body on Ekadashi.

6767 2018-12-31 12:33:38 Yes, I followed the @WHTV_Dunc 's method. I think the only deviation I do is I Nuln Oil wash quite generously all over, so I get a darker shade of Blue.
6768 2018-12-31 12:33:31 He takes copious amounts of snake oil..
6769 2018-12-31 12:33:25 Probably wanted something that wasn’t entirely soaked in olive oil.
6770 2018-12-31 12:33:22 We have come to this due to the games of oil corps, the price and sale of oil is based on markets which is driven by oil companies.  Oil companies move oil based on cost and to earn max profits.
6771 2018-12-31 12:33:20 I guna micellar garnier biru. Sbb bila guna cleansing oil terus keluar biji2 mcm fungal acnes tu. So i guess mmg muka i tak boleh accept mineral oil :")
6772 2018-12-31 12:33:05 @caniravkaria sir which of the two is better, according to you, Oil India or Indian Oil... For 3 yrs.
6773 2018-12-31 12:33:01 Ofc you didn’t get the wedding gig Jamie Oliver, who wants olive oil soaked jerk rice.
6774 2018-12-31 12:32:56 I suggested something similar a couple of days ago... my version was raising an army from the millions of able-bodied refugees&taking control of their former States, starting with Syria. They all get to go home to reformed home countries, we(GB, EU etc.) get paid in oil and trade
6775 2018-12-31 12:32:47 Thanks to oil shortage, fitness rooms will soon go bankrupt.
6776 2018-12-31 12:32:40 I understand . But then again how do they milk oil outa carrots ?
6777 2018-12-31 12:32:25 Wrong term James, not snake oil salesman, 100% DNA of all snake in Congress. Durbin,Blumenthal,Flake,Swalwell,Gutierrez, Weyden, Booker, Whitehouse,Warmer,Schiff & Feinstein. Just to name a few.
6778 2018-12-31 12:32:19 i really tried it with an aquarius knowing me & air signs are oil & water. 

whew chile, poor planning.
6779 2018-12-31 12:31:58 Bullish $DNR. 2019 expect crude oil $52+
6780 2018-12-31 12:31:34 คืนนี้กูไม่อาบน้ำละ
6781 2018-12-31 12:31:06 I call BS. Low oil prices World wide are the cause of low gas prices.

6784 2018-12-31 12:30:38 Coffee is the second most traded commodity on Earth after oil.
6785 2018-12-31 12:30:35 On this last #trading day and #NYE2018, markets looks to rally 1%+.  The $DJIA and $SPX are both sitting around down 5%.  The $QQQ and $GLD are both hovering around unchanged for the year as well.  But oil ($USO) which had the toughest time down 20% YTD and 40% from the peak.
6786 2018-12-31 12:30:29 Here we go again. Not understanding civics. He won more republican votes than any candidate in history.  He beat 16 swamp rats for the nomination. Anyone who thought Killary and her corrupt family was going to win also believe snake oil salesmen.  He won. Get over it!

6789 2018-12-31 12:30:09 Investigated using GeoThermal power to replace oil on our farm.
Quoted price 13 times higher than fossil-fuel based system.
Until the prices and subsidies are there to move ppl over to green energy, the cost will remain prohibitive.

6794 2018-12-31 12:29:42 Andrew, this makes my heart swell for you all! Love it!! We had an amazing year too! Our game changer is the CBD oil! I love it!  Our babies deserve joy!
6795 2018-12-31 12:29:20 Try CBD oil. It helped me beyond anything else I've tried for depression and anxiety in the past 15 years. Hang in there!
6796 2018-12-31 12:29:19 ありがとうございます……！！来年も頑張って推していきます……！

6802 2018-12-31 12:28:53 Vitamin E oil is wonderful for dry chapped lips. Use in place of a chap stick or lip balm.

6805 2018-12-31 12:28:41 Well he's pushing Rachel maddow's button under the table
6806 2018-12-31 12:28:25 @kfc went to Maylands may as well be shut -couldn't order what you wanted - what I got was and oil field and the dog wouldn't eat the rest
6807 2018-12-31 12:28:16 If y’all ever feel bad about how unhealthy you are eating, remember that I once buttered a piece of bread and then fried it in a pan with way to much oil and then ate 3 and a half of them.
6808 2018-12-31 12:28:10 CBD oil!!!!
6809 2018-12-31 12:28:09 sushi is healthier than pizza n fastfood 

sushi is probably healthier than all foods bc it has no oil and isnt fried
6810 2018-12-31 12:28:01 Looks like the red line on the cover of #TRUMPONOMICS needs to be inverted. Trump's policies are beginning to destroy the American economy—unless, of course, you like coal and other out-dated fossil fuel. Oops! Scratch that. Coal's down over 20%, oil almost 15% for 2018, too.
6811 2018-12-31 12:27:51 Returning to food - I had a grilled prawn/lemon/garlic/oil starter on Malta once and I still dream of it. Shame I can’t remember the restaurant name but the owner was Sicilian.  I keep looking for something in the UK that comes close
6812 2018-12-31 12:27:43 It’s not all about the US.   China and Europe are also in bear markets. As are oil and commodities.  China, the world’s growth engine is under attack. Europe is floundering.   The US is clearly late cycle. Trumps in the White House.

6814 2018-12-31 12:27:14 Quit dividing ...I am not voting 4 anyone that wants 2 talk us out of universal while taking money from insurance industry, that talks climate change while taking money from oil & gas ...it would be wise if you did the same then things could change & we could quit this bitching

6816 2018-12-31 12:27:07 You put way too much olive oil in everything! @jamieoliver

6818 2018-12-31 12:26:56 I know I don't - my own little self study has shown toothpaste and brushing are irrelevant - appropriate diet & oil pulling have kept my teeth healthy / healed painful teeth I assume were cavities for 3.5 yrs now. If u think toothpaste / brushing is nec, fine. I know differently
6819 2018-12-31 12:26:39 Few years they were like water n oil boom now they will be working together
6820 2018-12-31 12:26:33 Works great for me to. But it doesn't make it the best lol. Been using sesame oil for about a week and my skin is practically glowing
6821 2018-12-31 12:26:30 When my main 1 comes true just make sure you bring the biggest bottle of baby oil with you  All the best to you and yours as well

6827 2018-12-31 12:25:18 How to get to sleep  
- gently rub pressure points on your head - this relaxes you 
- apply essential oil to your 3rd eye area
- drink camomile tea as it helps to relax your body
- slowly tire yourself out during day; i.e, light workout, walks/jogs
6828 2018-12-31 12:25:12 It's not me who believes it Gerry, it's the Scottish Government saying so, clearly and unequivocally. Scotland's fiscal balance includes our share of Revenue from oil and gas.

Why would the SNP-led Sc Gov lie to somehow make Scotland's fiscal position look worse than it is?
6829 2018-12-31 12:24:57 Easy, the snake oil business has been very lucrative for him his whole life

6832 2018-12-31 12:24:04 He made too many sweeping allegations and he is not pro sustainability but just anti palm oil.
6833 2018-12-31 12:24:01 olive cream gitu bukan olive oil maap

Arm yourself.
"I brought coconut oil, blueberries, walnuts & maple syrup!"
You shall conquer!
6837 2018-12-31 12:23:44 Actually, dough, raisins, scoop full in boiling oil and let it go until brown. They are up to 8cm in diameter.
6838 2018-12-31 12:23:39 When the APNU/PNC hear about oil, they're trying even harder to resist letting go at all cost. Even if it means reverting to their old ways. Dictatorship. The options they're exploring are rigging / murder, and bullying strategies. Remember Fr. Dark & Walter Rodney?

6840 2018-12-31 12:23:04 Ahhhhhh the drill then!! He''ll no doubt suggest an additive for the oil, trouble is, boilers don't like it #CantWin
6841 2018-12-31 12:22:57 Correct. But due to the destruction it’s harvesting causes some people choose products and companies that are palm oil free.
6842 2018-12-31 12:22:17 Nobody has stopped driving from what I can see, the farmers are still out burning their fields in the Fall, garbage dumps are still filling up, oil is still being sought after, factories still pollute the atmosphere ... sorry, folks, we don't have much time left here on Earth.
6843 2018-12-31 12:22:14 The Polynesian women were laughing as they rubbed me down with Coconut oil, than held me as a dark man seduced me .
6844 2018-12-31 12:21:58 Those in the military-industrial complex, with hooks into government spending are fixed for life. Plus there are Americans who rely on tax abatements/incentives, farm subsidies, coal/oil/energy incentives & some rely on disability SSI/SNAP programs.
6845 2018-12-31 12:21:40 What abt occupying other people’s lands with the greed of oil and $!!
6846 2018-12-31 12:21:39 Apply some baby oil !! It will get better
6847 2018-12-31 12:21:24 Jane Fonda is also from CA, a pretty big oil producing state but tar sands bad. I honestly feel that people who protest and despise oil should stop using oil and it's products. It's like PETA members having a steak in their fur coats while telling others to not do either.
6848 2018-12-31 12:21:20 突然絵柄をかえるんじゃないよ！
6849 2018-12-31 12:21:16 So property claims are indirectly funded on violence?
For example, if an islamist militia occupied an Iraqi oil field and sold it to a Saudi investor, that investor would have a rightful claim to administrate that land and extract resources from it?
6850 2018-12-31 12:21:16 U.S.HRZ land rig count +5, total land +3. Tight oil +3, sh gas +2. Tight oil: Permian +2, Granite Wash +1. Sh gas: Haynesville +1, Utica +1.
6851 2018-12-31 12:21:16 Do you believe coal and oil to be fossil fuel, yes or no?
6852 2018-12-31 12:21:13 Going to make some steel cut oats this morning (so good with coconut oil, blueberries, walnuts & maple syrup!) I need to eat because I took pain meds, but I don’t want to wake the dogs up. I didn’t get enough sleep. I’m not ready to face the day.
6853 2018-12-31 12:21:05 sana oil :--((

6855 2018-12-31 12:20:55 10 years ago today I burned the NYE midnight oil at Echo Towers with @neilperrett_  as Jimmy Quinn was sacked and Eddie Howe appointed, tearing up pages and re-planning an entire sports section...

Never in a million years did either of us think #AFCB would be where they are now.
6856 2018-12-31 12:20:40 What like the lady in Goldfinger (but probably in a nice gunmetal grey?). Or are you thinking more like the 13th Earl of Wimbourne (oil on canvas, pint in one hand, PlayStation controller in the other)?

6859 2018-12-31 12:20:38 Sturgeon's problem is that for all her failed attempts to whip up Indy fervour over Brexit, the SNP are essentially peddling the same snake oil - dragging a country, at whatever cost, out of a union which despite its flaws is longstanding, successful and mutually beneficial.
6860 2018-12-31 12:20:29 Tbh shes no oil painting i was surprised when she told me shes the shy type and she used to be big girl so her boobs need a lift after losing all the weight that what she saving for next lol - im her gay uncle and only a few years older so she tells me this kind of thing lol 
6861 2018-12-31 12:20:28 Sells more oil.

6870 2018-12-31 12:20:00 Somente agradecer ao Pai, pois ele está vendo o que realmente precisamos no nosso Brasil.
6871 2018-12-31 12:19:52 If we were doing a war for oil, we would have stopped north of Basra and put in an airhead with the Kurds at Suleimaniyah. There is no oil in the rest of the country.
6872 2018-12-31 12:19:40 Sana Oil. 
6873 2018-12-31 12:19:40 if fries things in air instead of oil
6874 2018-12-31 12:19:38 Maybe he could take some cannabis oil for the swollen head. I’ll suggest it to him!
6875 2018-12-31 12:19:35 Quick one: COCONUT OIL is the best for your skin. 

Stop destroying your Epidermis.
6876 2018-12-31 12:19:26 @GraysonDolan   apply oil
6877 2018-12-31 12:19:25 ไว้กินอ่ะเจอไหมละ
6878 2018-12-31 12:19:10 mine too! TF? just put baby oil on it DAILY and it will go 
6879 2018-12-31 12:19:06 It has nothing to do with scrapping the carbon tax. Oil is less than $50/barrel that's why!
6880 2018-12-31 12:19:05 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
6881 2018-12-31 12:18:57 Use coconut oil!!! Sooooo very helpful 
6882 2018-12-31 12:18:47 Yeah.. There is something called Sex bumps, which happens due to lack of sex. 'Sexual hormones also increase the production of sebum. If bacteria (known as P. acnes) are present together with sebum (oil), then this can trigger acne development. '
6883 2018-12-31 12:18:39 Coconut oil is a life saver for this , trust me
6884 2018-12-31 12:18:36 4時くらいに目が覚めてそのままベッドに潜りながらTwitter開いてサマイチのセックスについて話し始めるとか、やりがちですよね！
6885 2018-12-31 12:18:30 But some coconut oil on it
6886 2018-12-31 12:18:20 Not putting anything there that hasn't been there before if you consider coal and oil to be fossil fuels.
6887 2018-12-31 12:17:38 1 ha of land = 3.47 t palm oil, rapeseed oil 0.79 t, soybean oil 0.45 t, sunflower 0.7 t

30% production contribution on 6.7% land for oil crop

To replace palm oil, will need land bigger than UK, France and Belgium put together for rapeseed

Burden to produce will shift. Amazon?

6892 2018-12-31 12:17:03 น่าสงสารคนได้จัง ฝาชีืเอา แหไปจับฉลาก
6893 2018-12-31 12:16:51 No, I do not think vegans (or anyone) should eat products with palm oil. Most people who go vegan, do it to stop animal suffering, and us buying palm oil products contributes to animals suffering.

6901 2018-12-31 12:15:49 The reason why is becaus thier leaders were cruel but they cared for thier countries. Zimbabwean leaders are not only cruel, but they also do not care how the rest of the country is doing. They shared the profits of the oil. Our leaders made 15 Billion vanish on thier own.
6902 2018-12-31 12:15:49 ま、ま……輝……ありがとうございます……あの、こちらこそいつも素敵な絵をありがとうございます……是非来年はたくさんお話ししたいです……！！

6904 2018-12-31 12:15:26 45 had these laws 2 protect me OVERTURNED 

 -Requirement for oil & gas companies to report methane emissions leaks 
 -Policy that limits toxic emissions from industrial facilities 
 -Rule that restricts the use of hydrofluorocarbons as replacements for ozone-depleting compounds
6905 2018-12-31 12:15:25 #crudeoil will touch under where it starts today. Violent moves will continue. Friday i said i would wait 66.5 and above for short. #oott i start shortimg aiming 45.0x #oil 47.2 above 4 hrs closing dangerous for bears
6906 2018-12-31 12:15:22 The fact is, and still is, that an iScot could and would have used £, not only would it be in an iScots interest but to ensure the strength of £ it would be in rUKs interest too.  I have no argument re the Oil price except to say taxation in iScot May have increased revenues
6907 2018-12-31 12:15:22 Keep this shut down going
6908 2018-12-31 12:15:18 Nice

6911 2018-12-31 12:14:47 So you believe the scientists who can make oil into all the things we need to use, but not when they tell you what it is and what its made from?
6912 2018-12-31 12:14:45 Bravo for watching it again. But I think srk goes from being childish to flirting and then comes the wet saree if I recollect. Love went to bring oil no?
6913 2018-12-31 12:14:44 QUIT LIVING IN THE PAST. OIL IS PASSE.
WE DONT WANT TO GO THAT ROUTE ANYMORE.
JOIN THE MODERN WORLD, OLD FOGIE!

6915 2018-12-31 12:14:37 Good to see #UJO finally but ever so slowly on the move.... It’s the best UK onshore play on the market. Debt free, low MC, 2 potential  company maker drills. Lot of upside in their SP. could multi bag on either of their oil or gas  drills

6918 2018-12-31 12:13:58 Yup innovation is really strong in AB how you keeping coming up with bigger cowboys hats is beyond me ! , and being landlocked should do wonders for oil transportation .
6919 2018-12-31 12:13:52 This is the secret.  The longer we lie on the mat, the more time we are wasting.  I've always like a line from a Midnight Oil song, "Better to die on your feet than live on your knees."
6920 2018-12-31 12:13:43 @foxandfriends Total yearly world production of oil is 1.5 trillion gallons.  A cubic mile is 1.1 trillion gallons. Compared to forest fires and volcanoes, oil is a minor pollutant. Gov "Moonbeam" Brown is wrong.

6922 2018-12-31 12:13:27 just had a thai hot oil massage where at one point I opened my eyes & saw my masseuse on all fours sitting on my back ... needless to say it was amazing and painful at the same time #thailiving 
6923 2018-12-31 12:13:11 13 years for me, and ironically my last flight was to a conference on peak oil!

6931 2018-12-31 12:11:35 Crude oil prices look likely to trade below $70 per barrel in 2019 as surplus production, much of it from the United States, and slowing economic growth undermine OPEC-led efforts to shore up the market, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.
6932 2018-12-31 12:11:27 True. The Russian campaign was a disaster for Germany, driven by Hitler's need for the Russian oil fields. He also underestimated the tenacity of the Russian people, army and Russian winter!
If he had not broken the peace treaty with Russia, WW2 would have ended very differently.
6933 2018-12-31 12:11:26 I swear
This shit is so irritating, i will just pick and put the phone in my pocket.

6938 2018-12-31 12:10:43 Stop attacking Bernie. It’s a setup. Beto’s record was questioned for his support of Big Oil and other destructive corporate interests. If he’s a strong candidate he can deal with it. What are the policies of these people is what we need to be asking...
6939 2018-12-31 12:10:36 sana oil happi
6940 2018-12-31 12:10:29 I know it doesn't. Oil is made from organic compounds/dead trees for example.  over millions of years of being compresed in the ground. There is also evidence of animal to microbial life found in oil when pulled from the ground.We often find dinosaurs when mining for oil/minerals

6950 2018-12-31 12:09:21 True. But there's little to dispute that the SNP were caught napping in those areas that the Tories concentrated their attack; namely the fall in oil price, and the currency which an indy Scotland would opt for. Lessons learned hopefully.

6954 2018-12-31 12:08:58 PSA: finally found the answer to my tanning prayers. If you struggle scrubbing your tan off before reapplying, BABY OIL is the answer. Just cover yourself in it and leave it for 15 mins before showering and exfoliating. Came off like a dream I am shooook.

6957 2018-12-31 12:08:18 Again.
Oil is 25% less expensive now than Dec 2017.
Hence the lower gas prices.
By the way, whats the price of diesel?
6958 2018-12-31 12:08:08 I’ve tried Vaseline but I’m gna buy castor oil
6959 2018-12-31 12:07:58 You can use it as a revision tool. Burn  scented oils while you study something and bring a tissue with the oil in it as an aide memoire during the exam.
6960 2018-12-31 12:07:55 I love to sit around with friends, a bottle of nice white wine I. The sun and dip radishes in good olive oil and a sprinkling is sea salt. A delicious way to spend an afternoon
6961 2018-12-31 12:07:54 Oil is said to be the blood of the Earth. Not Marine animals decomposing. We're not sure what Oil is, it's something to look into. Petrol isn't made from oil.
6962 2018-12-31 12:07:53 Predominantly in oil and gas

6970 2018-12-31 12:07:18 I mean, sure, a pecorino, olive oil or feta cheese shortage is not a crisis in the strictest sense of the word, but it will put some serious strain on a lot of the food sector. Strain means lost money, means lost jobs, means failed businesses. It's not great either.
6971 2018-12-31 12:07:04 A little late to the party but, I’ve done both boil (5mins) and cold steep post ferm. Prepped by chopping and batch toasting the day before and stored them in paper bags. The bags absorb some of the oil. Boil was better with no head retention issues. 
6972 2018-12-31 12:06:46 I should go get my oil changed today 
6973 2018-12-31 12:06:40 Hmm I wonder how many small planes enter America’s air space? How many tunnels have been found over the years? Oh and the small boats that are found?

6984 2018-12-31 12:05:18 Oil headed for its first annual loss since 2015, slumping more than 24% in a turbulent year that saw fears of supply scarcity turn to expectations of a surplus. WTI crude has also plunged 38% this quarter, the worst in four years

7030 2018-12-31 11:59:18 Yes, the smell of engine oil reminds me of my grandad - he was always tinkering with cars. My other grandad was a gardener and the smell of paraffin takes me back to his greenhouse - the fuel for his heater.

7102 2018-12-31 11:49:25 Oh I see. Really interesting about the olive oil. How are you feeling after a few days there?
7103 2018-12-31 11:49:25 1. You people are incredible, you act like US oil companies give a shit about funding conflicts through extracting Saudi oil, Saudi Arabia isn’t the only oil producing nation, if this was a concern of theirs, they’d simply strengthen relations with a less problematic state.

Trouble is, we always get in when it’s already crowded. A country financed by revenue from crude oil, a commodity every sensible nation is “droppping like it’s hot”. 

When will Nigeria start seriously looking at alternative revenue from oil and stop paying lip service.

7147 2018-12-31 11:44:08 I’m baffled that the oil companies and oil producing countries don’t highlight some of this.... its not like they don’t have any money.  Unless it is just bullshit.

7163 2018-12-31 11:41:55 I don’t think palm oil is good at all but by definition it’s not not vegan? If that makes sense? I think everyone should be aware of it and what it does like I’m tryna reduce my intake of it but I know it’s harder for some than others!
7164 2018-12-31 11:41:45 Quite a number of people work for the oil and gas industry in Texas. They are still individual contributors. Look more closely at the donations and I'll suspect you'll find a large number of small contributions,  rather than a small number of huge contributions.
7165 2018-12-31 11:41:42 The truth is that as long as oil,gas & the arms industry is more valuable than human life then our days are numbered.Fighting against this oil economy has cost many honest men & women their lives,may sound over the top but until we boycott at a higher level things wont change.
7166 2018-12-31 11:41:21 Palm Oil ban is not constructive, its just going to alter the destruction from Indonesia to other parts of south america. Palm oil will need to be substituted by 10x of soy for the same amount. Sustainable palmoil is the way forward.
7167 2018-12-31 11:41:17 ...and you'd need to establish your own military...to reoccupy all the oil rigs that the English will have taken over and will never willingly give up!

7195 2018-12-31 11:37:36 Donnie Walls: your gutless Khashoggi coverup entails MBS hooking you up with cheap oil so gas prices look good to your mindless minions.  Mueller is going to grind you up, coward.
7196 2018-12-31 11:37:29 An iScot could choose any currency, we may not have had complete fiscal autonomy but we could still have used it.  I’m not trying to justify the claims in the White paper, but as a result of the fall in oil price any Scot Gov would have had to rethink the economic strategy

7214 2018-12-31 11:35:07 2019 is the year I resolve to finally get my oil changed. I can feel it. This is the year!
7215 2018-12-31 11:34:59 And actually, there is some evidence that peppermint oil helps with nausea.
7216 2018-12-31 11:34:58 Never a word about Mad dog Madura in oil rich Venezuela tho,where already over 3 million people have fled to neighbouring not very wealthy countries,remainers have to search rubbish for scraps of food,I suppose Putin will come to their aid?
7217 2018-12-31 11:34:35 Even when oil price was booming at the global market, Nigeria producing her highest barrel per day, poverty still grows to 61%, some state governors were unable to pay salaries, zero infrastructures were put in place, foreign reserve was depleted & corruption was celebrated
7218 2018-12-31 11:34:26 my oil is literally oozing out of me, i'm so horny for a hot piece of hummer ass
7219 2018-12-31 11:34:00 Je me dis souvent ça pour me rassurer aussi : Le solde actuel de mon compte bancaire est un très mauvais indicateur de ma richesse future.

7249 2018-12-31 11:28:45 There is a movement of change - but a constant battle between Big Oil and fossil fuel industry like Trump Russia SA who will never give up their precious oil and increase their drilling and exploration now in Arctic seismic blasting etc
7250 2018-12-31 11:28:45 sana oil hahahah
7251 2018-12-31 11:28:43 But oil reserves are depleting whereas data quantity  is increasing enormously.
7252 2018-12-31 11:28:40 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 5 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

7258 2018-12-31 11:28:05 You really are a twisted opportunist. These kids are dead because their parents were negligent & irresponsible & responding to your continued encouragement of illegal immigration. There's going to be a special place in hell for snake oil salesmen like you Bernie.
7259 2018-12-31 11:27:46 I should add that they go straight in the trash. Snake Oil is as old as the trees...
7260 2018-12-31 11:27:38 On the macro level, top watch is the dollar. Seems like it wants to roll over, but just hasn't done so yet. $TLT and $GLD have both turned up, which suggests dollar should be feeling some pressure. CAD and YEN both tracking oil closely, EUR just wandering sideways.
7261 2018-12-31 11:27:34 #UPL it’s a huge drill if successful plus the Tunisian news recently and Tunisian CPR could throw up at least 1TCF of gas plus oil. Sarawak news could dwarf the lot but for now #UPL is looking like a very good prospect for 2019 and beyond.

7264 2018-12-31 11:27:04 Plant trees but also replace old vehicles which'll not only decrease air pollution but also save massive foreign reserves used in oil import
7265 2018-12-31 11:26:47 Oooh!!!! You got story of the secret of oil! Tell me what you think!
7266 2018-12-31 11:26:03 Check history oil prices fell below the budget bench mark and that was what led to the austerity measure adopted by that government because it is usually one of the conditions of IMF to advance loan any country.
7267 2018-12-31 11:26:03 And I didn't approve of your old boss sending me to Fallujah to find WMDs, no wait... institute western liberal democratic institutions where they never existed before... and the Iraqi oil will pay for it. How'd that noe-con BS pay off?
7268 2018-12-31 11:25:39 don't get me wrong i LOVE potatoes fresh out of the ground. but just pop those suckers open and add olive oil and salt and pepper, maybe something extra and it's a delicious snack. i'm not an advocate for canned food, but when you're getting free food you eat

7270 2018-12-31 11:25:27 I use random conditioner once a week but if you want to 'fix' or 'improve' overrall quality i suggest any product with keratin .. coconut oil products are also a scam and let your hair airdry after shower instead of smashing the towel in it, it's proven to be better

7273 2018-12-31 11:24:34 so you see 50% of 5billion barrels of oil a bad thing and trillions of cubic feet of gas which we will be the operator

7282 2018-12-31 11:23:19 And killing off the orangutans- diesel is 51% palm oil. Otherwise, I agree! It is a measly amount in the grand scheme of people’s lives - they are more concerned about being able to heat and eat!

7323 2018-12-31 11:17:49 "...because whatever the problem, business can create the illusion of helping while maximizing a return on investment and minimizing humanity." is actually a pretty good description of capitalism and the foundation of every batch of snake oil ever cooked up.

7332 2018-12-31 11:16:27 Disagree. There’s not enough of this. It’s something of an untapped resource. Like oil below the ice of Antarctica we all know there’s plenty to exploit there but everyone is afraid to make a move.
7333 2018-12-31 11:16:26 Yes - but it's difficult to obtain Palm Oil without i) A Factory ii) Impacting Rainforest... Nevermore homeless orangutans.

7343 2018-12-31 11:15:41 This is a lame claim, you're still ignorant on your own
This is federal revenue alone and with TSA goes direct to federal purse, every other states has its own state revenue gen thru tax and all but varies
It's monies from oil sales and excess crude that is shared btw states
7344 2018-12-31 11:15:32 Mamador should just concentrate on vegetable oil. Their margarine tastes like sorrow

7357 2018-12-31 11:13:23 It’s funny how most of us blame the oil and gas industry, yet drive ours cars around everyday using the exact product we are vilifying. Laws of supply and demand, if we as consumers find ways to less oil the industry will be forced to produce less product.
7358 2018-12-31 11:13:17 A bad luck fi start the new year wid oil inna yuh back?
7359 2018-12-31 11:12:59 Soybean and sunflower oil, seriously? My tips: 1)read @andrewmente‘s PURE study... 2)don’t fall for the “expertise” of conflicted panels advising policy and guidelines; 3)Take a look at @marionnestle’s work on food industry influence on science; 4) Evidence first, please.

7362 2018-12-31 11:12:46 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
7363 2018-12-31 11:12:39 Avoid anti-dandruff shampoo. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Do not use hair styling gels. Is it NISIM or NHB? slows hair loss. or close to it. How will I unearth the legitimate portal. Need to buy some. Had no parabens.
7364 2018-12-31 11:12:37 She pours some oil and then adds the eggs and bacon at the same time
7365 2018-12-31 11:12:32 India will make direct payment to Iran. No proposal under consideration to use barter system to continue import
"Currently there is no proposal for barter trade involving direct exchange of goods for oil purchases under consideration," Ministry of @CimGOI  said in Lok Sabha.

7372 2018-12-31 11:11:23 Don’t deny that, we need to wean ourselves off dependence on oil
7373 2018-12-31 11:11:07 Reminder that in the win9x era it was commonplace to run a specialized program that would just allocate all the memory, forcing everything to swap. The idea was once closed, launching your big game would immediately have all the memory available for wiring. Max snake oil.

7377 2018-12-31 11:10:35 Wow that article was from Jan 14 when oil prices were forecast to go stratospheric. Well we know what happened next. The Scottish electorate not taken in by shite predictions & the oil price went into free fall.

7385 2018-12-31 11:09:17 Ah yes: here we'd call it a 45 gallon drum, the difference of course being between the UK/US ratings for a "gallon". The engine oil for the tractors used to be delivered in them & with an integral lid, the trick was in cutting it out without leaving a jagged edge!

7405 2018-12-31 11:06:01 Yes, Sunflower is a very light non greasy easily absorbable oil definitely. Sweet Almond a close second alternative however Olive a little heavy in my opinion. - Mary.

7424 2018-12-31 11:03:36 Umm, is it something to do with the price of oil?
7425 2018-12-31 11:03:31 I'm the same way and use all natural deterrents to keep the unwanted from invading. My wall is peppermint oil and cayenne pepper.

7427 2018-12-31 11:02:40  Alberta needs to except there oil is worthless .. If the country is sold on Alberta oil then Canada needs to refine our product and save our country from pipelines ... Supply the world in  finished product  !!!! 
7428 2018-12-31 11:02:37 Palm oil aswell.. best leave it in the shop
7429 2018-12-31 11:02:25 It’s really time to change the narrative somehow. I mean, what part of “we are facing climate catastrophe now” do we not get? #GreenNewDeal and #NoMoreWar go hand in hand, as the military is the largest single user of oil. 2020 has to be about carbon capture & renewable energy.

7436 2018-12-31 11:01:54 He shuddered a little when Xichen pulled back, but he still managed to give a smile. "It's enough," he said, shifting up, pulling himself off from the fingers that were stretching him. "I want to feel it after." He moved backward, hand snatching the bottle of oil that lay >

7449 2018-12-31 10:59:56 just want to know what the issue was since they needed to take out a small amount of oil to get it sorted, and why they couldnt be bothered to put it back into the tank
7450 2018-12-31 10:59:45 What was the critique? That ppl who work for Oil and Gas companies gave a lot of money to Beto? In the state of Texas where Oil and Gas is a huge %age of the state’s jobs and economy? Sirota was trying to make it look like Oil & Gas companies were donating to Beto.

7617 2018-12-31 10:29:31 Norway is literally the most heavily taxed country in the world as well as one of the most expensive places to live and has one of the highest depression rates to boot.

If they didn't have the state controlling its oil supply the people would have revolted years ago.

7641 2018-12-31 10:25:08 My most interesting observation on Manila is that bottled drinks are sold 100% full so you have no choice but to spill a little bit when you open them. Also cooking oil is sold in bags.

7669 2018-12-31 10:21:23 Interesting hearing about the carbon tax again. Obviously no discussion on the nationalization of Oil companies to pay for the damages they knowingly inflicted on everyone. Their suppression of emerging green tech and continuing corrupting influence on government needs to end.

7731 2018-12-31 10:12:11 You are kidding, right? You really want to replace burning fossil fuels with burning trees? Is it OK now to clear cut land for copper mines or palm oil if the trees are burned for heat or electricity.  How about we burn fossil fuel and don't go nuts cutting down trees.
7732 2018-12-31 10:12:06 If you understood the science & the serious nature of what is happening you would not be spreading this.

7756 2018-12-31 10:06:39 Woody started off name dropping places he’d visited to get opinion of real Brits- all sounded very estuary (Margate, Ramsgate & the like) then  stumbled, referring to oil men in far north of Scotland - or were they protestors at Trump Golf, Balmedie?

7806 2018-12-31 09:55:04 Even in #SouthSudan they keep totally ignoring specially USA Gov they keep waiting them killing each other. Maybe because the Oil deals with #China & the funny thing US Gov said that Sudan Gov are one of the peace maker in SouthSudan ! They are kidding me !

7856 2018-12-31 09:47:00 Worth reading. The words are taken from the migrant pact and are very powerful when put into a different context. Just consider for a moment the reaction if 1000,s of people from the west decided to migrate to the oil rich countries of the middle east.

• Use a defuser
• Try and relieve stress

In winter sometimes i slather coconut oil on before bed if I’m dry.
7896 2018-12-31 09:40:17 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
7897 2018-12-31 09:40:17 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

7930 2018-12-31 09:31:01 Incredibly unlikely.

Nearly every area of the global economy is flashing orange.

Doubt oil will drop much more as already low and shale creates a natural bottom as easy to turn on and off.

I very much doubt though it will go up even with a Chinese stimulus.

Only then can a proposed treatment work effectively and efficiently.

7960 2018-12-31 09:23:56 The most impressive prediction you made this year in my opinion, is the one you did on oil, several months before mid term, you predicted that the oil price would drop to $50-$55 around mid term, that’s exactly what happened. Very impressive stuff, I will never forget that!
7961 2018-12-31 09:23:51 As long as oil is worth an inflated price because we depend on it ,  we will have war until we lose our freedom
What was meant to happen was oil prices kept low& carbon tax added to pay for switching to green energy
Instead we need to nationalize our oil industry to control price

7981 2018-12-31 09:19:07 There’s a big difference in going to a ‘lender of last resort’ with $21bn in your kitty (in cash + oil facilities) vs. when you have only $12bn in leftovers available and that too depleting at a breakneck, signature “Punjab Speed” of $1.8bn a month (not #OrangeLine but #CAD).

8037 2018-12-31 09:09:06 Pretty sure stress is what got me in this mess.  

However, this did bring to mind that an RN friend of my SIL told her about the benefits of hemp oil.  She has some syndrome or other, and this helps.  So I looked it up and I'm thinking of trying it...nothing else seems   1/

8057 2018-12-31 09:04:32 I try to fix it by either 1) purposely putting more oil on it so it breaks out faster, then popping it and immediately putting a band aid over it

Or 2) lots of steam unless it sorts itself out and finally comes up

8064 2018-12-31 09:03:02 More garbage from a self-serving politician. Oil is down 50% and prices are down accordingly across the country.  Your govt deserves NO CREDIT for this. Stop lying to the people. It’s despicable.

8070 2018-12-31 09:01:55 some things like oil painting are really time intensive & your other weekly assignments therefore get less time bc of em. & maybe you feel like u can fit more time in on each, but just don’t regularly sacrifice sleeing/eating/downtime for them bc it’s unsustainable bad habits.

8105 2018-12-31 08:56:17 Sirji..this is due to reduction in crude oil prices worldwide and you also know same thing..
8106 2018-12-31 08:55:43 Yes that was naive imo. However the Money sent from politicians to the middle East dictators to wipe out their own people and throw their weight around for oil is not naivety it is pure power and greed.

8130 2018-12-31 08:51:06 Extremely thin wedge (if that's what it is).  But a faint echo of the disasterous consequences of US/UK destruction of Libya simply to take control of its oil, not to mention continued western meddling in Syria.  It's almost as if destablisation of Europe was also an objective...
8131 2018-12-31 08:50:50 Oil is a bonus. When we are in control of 100% of our resources Scotland will flourish.

8451 2018-12-31 07:57:00 So, try this on-Erdogan agrees to shut up about Khashoggi if the U.S. moves outta the way in Syria and hands over the entire suite of Kurdish acronyms for slaughter. Jabba/Kush get Saudis to replace bribes ISIS has been paying Turkey to smuggle oil out of Syria et al. Sweet, no?

8453 2018-12-31 07:56:57 A) Gas went up and down because of oil prices, not taxes.
B) No, my property tax didn't go up this year.
C) No, my food costs did not go up this year.
Food costs and gas costs are not taxes.
Taxes are taxes. And mine didn't go up.
Have a good day, Mike.

8460 2018-12-31 07:55:46 I’ve heard economists estimate construction and real estate direct and indirect is far higher than 25% of BC economy and that we are more reliant on real estate than Alberta is on oil. This is not a sustainable or stable way to build a provincial economy.

8501 2018-12-31 07:50:38 It did come about after all with the overthrow of a democratically elected government with large help from the UK and US, who had a lot to lose from oil nationalisation under Mossadegh, and a lot to win with a strong central authority like the Shah.

8529 2018-12-31 07:44:53 #Yearender.  It was a roller coaster ride for oil prices and the rupee in 2018. Crude oil prices hit new peaks until they peaked to 86 dollars a barrel. Rupee touched a new low of 74 rupees against the dollar, before recovering to 69 and then slipping again to 72.
8530 2018-12-31 07:44:50 Course he's the big oil industry's buddy. He bought an oil pipeline with our $ from them to just ram a pipeline through. He's teaming up with DJT for Keystone. He kept Harper's NEB rules. He kept Harper's lame-ass carbon targets. He continues giving corporate welfare to big oil.

8565 2018-12-31 07:37:51 i honestly agree & feel like steroids and all that expensive kinda crazy stuff is the answer but honestly if it helps it helps, to each their own. i just know coconut oil breaks a lot of people out and thats where i was coming from for the most part. if it helps it can’t be bad!
8566 2018-12-31 07:37:34 HOW TO USE:

Dip a clean mascara stick or cotton swab and stick it into any oil I wrote on the list. Apply it carefully to your lashes before bed and leave it on over-night. Then, wash it off with warm water. Repeat this daily till you get your desired result
8567 2018-12-31 07:37:26 Also my family olive oil business is launching soon. Behind schedule but will be very happy to share in the coming weeks. Sample bottles going out soon.

8613 2018-12-31 07:29:01 Makes sense. What slur and attacks you you use against your perceived enemy often describes yourself better than them. Examples: Saddam Hussein is a betrayer who is trying to conquer the the whole world. It's not his oil.

8640 2018-12-31 07:24:12 Right, the Iraq War was War for No Oil.

In contrast, Israel ended up with Iraq and Syria in chaos (although Iran was strengthened).

What Fukuyama told Krauthammer seems most reasonable: the Iraq War was the idea of a bunch of American neocons pretending to be tough Israelis.

S&P 500 - general market strength
DJIA - general market strength no 2
GBPUSD - I live in the UK so I like to see how our currency is doing, good to follow USD strength when investing in US stocks
CLF - crude oil price is a good sign of the general economy
8656 2018-12-31 07:21:06 personally id take an actual dermatologist’s advice (that coconut oil is in fact comedogenic and very bad for your skin) and shoot for something like shea butter which is very moisturizing and thick but not comedogenic and very good for your skin! :)

Further Norway has a very small population while being very rich thanks to very large oil income. Seems that socialism and social democracy are mixed up continuously in the USA.

8673 2018-12-31 07:17:43 That one needs some thought. I’m sure there is common interest that can be leveraged to get a deal & have this problem resolved permanently.

Having a prosperous economy serves everyone’s interests, holding back Alberta’s oil only serves foreign interests & hurts Canadians.
8674 2018-12-31 07:17:39 The bigger problem is our overly continued dependence on crude oil.

They can see how each brush stroke impacts the overall image. After all, it’s really  just individual strokes coming together
8730 2018-12-31 07:08:05 China must replace coal with renewables not LNG. Stricter regulations should be imposed on all ships. BTW, most of the oil we import comes from the US.

8733 2018-12-31 07:07:28 This was excellent! Great work & so needed. The denialism was ginned up by the oil industry, even though initially they concluded that fossil-fuel consumption elevated atmospheric CO2 & were very concerned. Time to fight back! #ClimateReality

8759 2018-12-31 07:03:49 I think a little bit of toasted sesame oil added late in cooking for flavor or in a homemade dressing is okay, just don't eat a ton of it. With toasted sesame, a little goes a long way, and damn, it's delicious. ;-) A little bit of tahini in homemade hummus not gonna kill someone

8776 2018-12-31 07:01:00 Is that so? I read about 和田地区 in Wikipedia. By the way I think maybe crude oil development isn't good for environment. I saw wildfire beginning. The flames were only from ground crack despite of plenty of grasses around the fire. Methane gas may spurt out and water disappear.
8777 2018-12-31 07:00:55 The one advantage of being lazy af and skipping showers for three days is that my hair got to sit and soak in the copious amounts of natural oil my scalp produces. I was an awful oil slick by the end. But...it’s going to look and feel awesome after that oil treatment

8779 2018-12-31 07:00:29 I still think oil is the red herring.  Unless oil has a rebound the $spy is a fade.  Everyone knows trump is posturing with the China trade deal.  The close on Friday is a indication that major funds are getting out.

8793 2018-12-31 06:58:13 Beto’s in a tough spot because so much of Texas economy is based on gas and oil, I think? But he still could support some regulation.. stop further off shore drilling.. something.

8799 2018-12-31 06:57:19 Hey @Treyarch have you ever thought of making a reactive camo for #Blackops that looks like a oil leak/spill. It can go from black to that rainbow like hue that oil has when light reflects off of it.
8800 2018-12-31 06:57:17 Hasn't oil tanked already...
8801 2018-12-31 06:56:41 dont you just want to slather his chest in oil and roll around on it

8804 2018-12-31 06:56:19 We already have the technology to switch to alternative energy and various vehicle alternatives.  Tesla has a huge charging grid network, but we need much more.  Without subsidies to oil & gas, and market manipulation, we would already be shifting very quickly.
8805 2018-12-31 06:56:14 @narendramodi achieved outstanding on #development, economy & world stage. #Petrol & #diesel @ lowest thanks to world crude oil prices. Vajpayee India Shining fiasco teach that’s not enough to win #Election2019.

8809 2018-12-31 06:54:59 Of course. Just if you're going to run Conversavitive, you have to be from AB, SK, MB, or NF. The oil & gas producing province. If not, you'd  better have pipeline east and west answers.
8810 2018-12-31 06:54:36 I went to buy poppers with my friend and he referred to it as “crackhead oil” lmaooo

8814 2018-12-31 06:54:22 There's lots more on Beto's voting against the climate and in favor of oil and gas  but that articles shows how Hillary supporters tried to claim Bernie was behind it. (why?) And it made the case for not settling for lousy candidates. 

Thanks for taking the time to read it.

8827 2018-12-31 06:51:51 The current downward pressure on oil prices should likely taper off from January, when OPEC-led supply cuts commence, analysts said.
8828 2018-12-31 06:51:45 Yeah, and we were told that OIL would run out by 1980.  Didn't happen so that made solar panels take a back seat for another 20 years.

8838 2018-12-31 06:50:07 Your husbands @EPA  department is destroying the environment by relaxing environmental protections to pay back his donors in the oil industry. Willingly putting ill gotten profit before clean air, clean drinking water. Animals & humans will and are suffering.

8865 2018-12-31 06:44:38 Thank you! I hope it helps. A little bit goes a LONG way. I got their oil of the same formula and I like it even better. I let my sister use it on some hip bone/muscle pain and it didn’t seem to help her, so I think it’s more geared toward pain that’s near the skin. Good luck!

8867 2018-12-31 06:43:59 Yup. Thats how it was when I worked for the state of texas. Supposed to manage car payments, diapers, gas, food for 5 kids, rent, oil changes, tires, and THEN if you have enough you can take care of yourself. People. Dont. Care.

8876 2018-12-31 06:42:21 A formula I use: oil + fresh vegetable + flavorful vinegar + honey or juice. Cook in frying pan until flavors mingle. Add water if veggies seem like they'll burn before cooking through. Proportions vary depending on flavors but ~ 1T oil, 2 cups veg, 2-3 T vinegar, 1T honey/juice

8880 2018-12-31 06:41:50 If you want a love message to be heard, it has to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it. -Mother Teresa #ALDUBBestof2018
8881 2018-12-31 06:41:48 These people lost me with their protests. They’ve burned through hundreds of thousands of dollars in the last two decades of high oil prices and I’m to vote for against what, exactly??? Debate on point. The issue with the Bills is NOT relevant here.
8882 2018-12-31 06:41:32 getting the tea tree oil from my toothpicks into my eyes... I new kind of beezing?
8883 2018-12-31 06:40:48 An excellent way of "ramping it up" is using CBD flowers instead of the oil, basically smoking/vaping at a higher temperature activates the small amount of THC which in turn releases the full effects of the CBD. DM if you need a link to a cheap source.
8884 2018-12-31 06:40:25 Where’s the so called Dinesh Guldu rao? Who rode bullock cart to protest against petrol rate hikes.. when the oil price was up..
8885 2018-12-31 06:40:08 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
8886 2018-12-31 06:40:08 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

8890 2018-12-31 06:39:23 Just stick with facts. Chemicals suck , plastic is awful , poisons are out of control.  I bet you have palm oil in some of your foods at home.  Palm  oil use is desyroying the rain forests , because of clear cutting and killing animals.  There is no such thing as ClimateChange.

8895 2018-12-31 06:38:31 Is there anything you know of that is immune from criticism? Everything is horrible when looked through a certain lens. Computers, cars, oil, coal, clothing, manufacturing, schools, healthcare, food – the list is endless.
8896 2018-12-31 06:38:09 Probably a bit of both - bad food cooked in bad oil kills the good bugs...

8900 2018-12-31 06:37:40 Highly complex one but as a rule, be Assertive and not Aggressive and that's something you, Vusi master very well. Being assertive sends a strong message but never leaves oil spills.
8901 2018-12-31 06:37:38 Changing that entire generation where every woman has a maid, driver, cook does nothing but what she wants and the state has been providing everything is not going to be easy.

8905 2018-12-31 06:36:50 You have to add the incredible damage this administration is doing to the environment. Trump has rolled back/eliminated virtually all of the regulations Obama put in place to address climate change. Every day under Trump has been Christmas for the oil, gas, and coal industries.

I pray for EXCELLENT OIL to flow upon your head & family as we go into 2019.
8920 2018-12-31 06:32:21 Mi did affi use likkle alcohol pon it cause I don’t have any tea tree oil  Gonna buy some tomorrow! I have Neosporin on it for now.
8921 2018-12-31 06:32:07 Yep & co-owns one of his many multi-million $ homes with an oil company. He also proclaims the world to be overpopulated & advises we should have less children, yet he has five. He's a capitalist millionare, land baron, lobbyist & an above average breeder, oh, & a hypocrite...
8922 2018-12-31 06:32:01 I do believe prices are higher there due to oil companies taking employees from local stores to work for them. This causes these stores to up the salaries which means prices go up.
8923 2018-12-31 06:31:51 lowkey want to get a medical weed card just so i can see if the cbd oil would actually help with my cfs

8924 2018-12-31 06:31:21 Lets migrate from an oil/gas based economy to a knowledge/passion based economy.
8925 2018-12-31 06:31:17 No it is a large site of reclamation. AND prior to oil sands development there was oil from the sands that flowed into the waterways. It's just better managed now by the petroleum producers. Alberta producers are the world's most consciousnesses.

8930 2018-12-31 06:30:50 So true, everyone knows South America is the largest island in the world. Tangerine Face is trying divide the island so Venezuela will fall and Trumpkins can steal the island’s oil and cook us with global warming. My gay friend in Trump’s concentration camp told me this

8934 2018-12-31 06:30:28 That’s weird. You’d think with all the oil production, it’d be cheaper.

8943 2018-12-31 06:28:58  imma check their oil on the way back to OKC then.
8944 2018-12-31 06:28:54 i think it could work in theory but most hot sauces have a lot of vinegar as well which... could end up dessicating them? so the end result might be dry irritation. u can buy straightup cooking chili oil for cheap at the grocery store and just use a dropper + follow up w lip balm
8945 2018-12-31 06:28:34 Don't think I will vote for the past. If you want to vote for the past go ahead. Even @OilGasCanada has got it's head out of its ass and is seeing the world has changed. We may not change in AB but the world has changed. NDP/ Liberals know we can't market oil w/o greenwashing.
8946 2018-12-31 06:28:17 At first I read that as oil pants and was genuinely confused lmao
8947 2018-12-31 06:28:06 Thank you for this. You have delivered the truth but how to get Albertans to pay attention? Support for the oil & gas industry seems to have morphed into a cult-like righteous holy crusade that can’t be questioned.
8948 2018-12-31 06:28:05 She needs an oil massage
8949 2018-12-31 06:28:02 What does Electricy have to with Oil?

Do you believe we send Electricity down a pipeline?

Credibility’s tan all time low there Buds!!
8950 2018-12-31 06:27:58 Yup.... its oil.  Just like any other oil.  Sometimes easier as it's so thick you can sometimes just roll it up.  Been there and done that.
8951 2018-12-31 06:27:49 Says the person that uses fossil fuels in her car, planes, oil for anything that has a rotor system as simple as a coffee maker Let me guess you need to use all the fuels and oil to make sure everyone don't right what a hypocrite maybe look up all the everyday things that use oil

8960 2018-12-31 06:26:44 I just did a Google search for “canola oil allergy” and learned that it is still incredibly uncommon, but some guy posted about it on Reddit in 2011 and got 1 reply. That’s p much it. 
8961 2018-12-31 06:26:17 Yours needs an oil change
8962 2018-12-31 06:26:11 Just had an argument with a senior doctor . He was questioned for promoting diabetic reversal therapy (3 day course) and coconut oil as oral chemo . The only argument for his points are these are ancient wisdom so clinical data is not warranted . If professionals are so gullible
8963 2018-12-31 06:26:08 They just flat out said he was interested in taking over Iraq's oil feilds...  This is BEFORE 911 happened!!
8964 2018-12-31 06:25:39 Hey, @CBCTheNational, "two and a half times more" is 250% more, not 2.5% more! So, what exactly did you mean to be the increase in oil shipped by rail?

8966 2018-12-31 06:25:22 “Big oil don’t surf” But it does power a lot of these cars to Bell’s Beach.
8967 2018-12-31 06:24:53 My first car was a 1994 Camry which I bought in 2010 during the graduate school. I bought a Model 3 today, of course with a red color. It is definitely a great upgrade. No more oil change, smog test, exhaust system, noisy internal combustion engine, etc.
8968 2018-12-31 06:24:52 Progressives call it like it is. We call out sanders on things like his anii BDS or his foreign policy weaknesses. We also can call out Beto from taking big oil cash and Harris for hot prosecuting Mnuchin. We are objective observers but policy-substance wins out.

8971 2018-12-31 06:24:07 you make it sound like they crunch and smell like canola oil
8972 2018-12-31 06:23:58 I wish I could wear makeup to fetes like y’all, but I sweat A LOT. And my face is an oil slick. I’ll look like I was rode hard and put out wet if I do that 
8973 2018-12-31 06:23:55 Oil wins always
8974 2018-12-31 06:23:52 Somebody (oil CEO) should be publicly executed for this !!! So it never happens again !!
8975 2018-12-31 06:23:47 I've heard that too faced lip plumper actually works and if it's got chili oil in it then theoretically you could use sriracha sauce as a lip plumper
8976 2018-12-31 06:23:46 Sometimes I don’t get you... the lovey dovey American relationship with Saudi Arabia which led to the crisis in Yemen goes all the way back to Rockefeller expanding his oil empire. How can you put the entire crisis on Obama?
8977 2018-12-31 06:23:34 In other words .@LindseyGrahamSC  you were reminded of the dirt Russia has on your and the big "oil" deal.  Not to worry.  Nancy will be on it in a few days!   #LockThemAllUp
8978 2018-12-31 06:23:25 Every time I hear @kierrasheard growl/squall “yeah, yeah, yeah,” on her song “You Are” I just wanna shout and buck all over Ellis county, my God!!!! She has the oil!!! #watchout #MyHeadMayJerk
8979 2018-12-31 06:23:24 U had a point until u didn't... Most "green" environmentalists aren't just pushing to prevent oil drilling/fracking etc, they're pushing for alternative fuel resources, rather than 100% reliance on oil. So yeh, there's that. You speak truth to power oft, just not this time.
8980 2018-12-31 06:23:16 This sick S.O.B. needs to be investigated for every lie he told about himself, & for every lie he told to the public. He knew his agenda going in, & that was to dismantle every safeguard put in place to save our natural resources & open public lands to oil & mineral exploitation
8981 2018-12-31 06:23:15 I remember them expanding the temporary foreign worker program in Alberta during the oil boom because businesses complained that no one wanted to work for $14/hour. People wanted to work, they just didn't want to work for employers that exploited lax labour laws to abuse them.
8982 2018-12-31 06:23:08 CBD oil is bonkers. One minute you’re watching TV and the next you’re in such a deep sleep nothing will wake you up. I love it.
8983 2018-12-31 06:23:03 tbh, best option is probably to put a little bit of oil on a frying pan/skillet and reheat it on there. i usually reheat pizza that way, just without using oil because i'm lazy (but not lazy enough to just microwave it, lol)
8984 2018-12-31 06:22:42 Has anyone taken cbd oil for anxiety? How is it?
8985 2018-12-31 06:22:23 try baby oil !!
8986 2018-12-31 06:22:20 I even managed to chemically exfoliate and do an oil mask. We’re entering 2019 with NO DEAD SKIN
8987 2018-12-31 06:22:18 I put olive oil on Jasmines head for 2 hours, rubbed it in and the brushed it/ picked out. Very therapeutic x
8988 2018-12-31 06:22:08 Celltone tissue oil? Do you go half and half when mixing??
8989 2018-12-31 06:22:04 Brush lightly to be a little oil.
8990 2018-12-31 06:22:04 #WHL RD/EDM:  A 3-point third period from @EdmOilKings Trey Fix-Wolansky turns a 4-2 deficit into a 5-4 win.  It's the Oil Kings' 2nd when trailing after 2 periods.  20th multiple point game (2+), 13th with at least three this year.  Improved from -15 last year to +21.

8994 2018-12-31 06:21:10 most lip plumpers are just irritants to cause like. a minor allergic reaction + swelling. so like my too faced plumper has chili oil in it

9003 2018-12-31 06:19:54 Put a little bit of tea tree oil in your shampoo. I’ll let you borrow mine in August.... 
9004 2018-12-31 06:19:39 But the discussion is purely academic anyway - oil and gas is here for our lifetimes because it gets cold in winter and we want to be warm. Do we want responsibly developed resources or not? If yes, Canada is the most responsible way to get oil out of the ground - period.

9016 2018-12-31 06:16:24 Amazing!  Their 100-year old car battery remained charged, the hoses didn't rot, and the oil didn't turn to sludge.   #TwilightZoneMarathon
9017 2018-12-31 06:16:15 Been oil cleansing at night for a few days. 10/10 would recommend
9018 2018-12-31 06:15:56 So this is how we would be cruising into 2019 without a functional refinery right? For a major oil producer whose President also doubles as Petroleum Minister, isn't that shameful?

Good Morning

9029 2018-12-31 06:14:45 Remind me how many feet of pipeline were laid by the previous conservative government? And any other government since the 80s for that matter. And, who was responsible for crashing oil prices?  You’re hysterical.
9030 2018-12-31 06:14:29 Oil magnates in Nigeria are attending cookie camps, gatherings that combine speeches about baby rights with sailing, run by an awkward Jordan Peterson fan.
9031 2018-12-31 06:14:16 When oil was over $100 per barrel gas was about $1.20/L. It is now about $50 per barrel and gas is around $1.00/L. Your math does not add up.

9033 2018-12-31 06:14:04 Oil prices gain, but set for first yearly drop since 2015: Oil prices climbed on the last trading day of the year on Monday, mirroring gains in stock markets, but were on track for the first yearly decline in three years amid lingering concerns of a persistent supply glut.
9034 2018-12-31 06:13:50 1) Wet your face with warm water

9051 2018-12-31 06:12:09 I’m more shocked that people liked this comment. Oil and gas is a relatively small part of Canadian economy and no one is trying to kill it overnight.

9098 2018-12-31 06:07:20 ON THE #2019Budget:
Nigeria is expected to cut its crude oil production to 1.68 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first half of 2019 - OPEC

2019 Budget Assumption:
Oil Production: 2.3 million bpd 

SHORTFALL: 620,000 bpd.

HOW WILL GOVT FUND THE #2019Budget?

9100 2018-12-31 06:07:10 God to hear the experience from SA; a country at times we call Africa’s Japan. The same practice in Nigeria where Crude Oil is exported and import back refined one. In Asia there are countries with no Oil reserve but have the refinery. Africa must wake up from its deep sleep!!!

9130 2018-12-31 06:01:32 The point of the post was to show how a much smaller country than Australia such as Norway can impose the highest tax on Oil production in the world (over 65%) and direct the tax proceeds to a National Fund which has become the largest in the world at over 1 trillion dollars.
9131 2018-12-31 06:01:31 its not weird to change your oil at 1am is it?
9132 2018-12-31 06:01:28 Ages ago? They didn't start aggressive shale production till the Obama years. The stigma of our product? But blood oil that flows in the East is stigma proof? The NDP instituted a carbon tax (scam) to get us a pipeline to Tidewater. Hows that working out?

9150 2018-12-31 05:58:40 It was the provincial conservatives that allowed the rapid dev.  of oil sands, despite being aware of a lack of refining and shipping options. They were warned in ‘07 and did nothing to prevent the situation we are currently in. Stop blaming the liberals for con fuck ups.
9151 2018-12-31 05:58:20 may nakita nga ako merong wil? sana oil.
9152 2018-12-31 05:58:10 He says Bush lied about WMD because oil was the real motivator. He also said the replaced regime should have been non-democratic so the general populous couldn't object to this. The problem is was the replacement was democratic & no Iraqi oil is in US hands decades later.
9153 2018-12-31 05:57:52 Use coconut oil
________
I know this seems stupid but once I had a hella lot of acne and I used a fiji coconut oil and my acne almost disappeard in a month. However if you have greasy skin you may not wanna use coconut oil.

9160 2018-12-31 05:56:43 Thanks..no idea about it but Mustard oil tend to heat up the skun n penetrate beneath so not advisable on abdomen
9161 2018-12-31 05:56:42 One well paying awesome customer yes. As soon as they started becoming our competitor, pipelines were approved to get oil to Tidewater. Oh wait, carbon tax and a social license should get us pipelines, right? The NDP created this message, they should own it!
9162 2018-12-31 05:56:28 His defined stance against the Oil and Gas Industry definately makes him less attractive to voters with said industry.

9165 2018-12-31 05:55:59 I'm laughing at the fools who vote @Alberta_UCP You think they will do what 44 years of PCs failed to do which is get more than one customer for the oil? Why do you think this crop of user Cons will do what the last batch failed to do for 44 years? Cuz they're Conservatives? LOL.

9174 2018-12-31 05:54:29 Yoooo. Rosemary essential oil is the shit. Just applied some to my scalp bc the dryness and itchiness I experience with locs can be intense at times and it totally cooled my scalp. The aroma is STRONG though. Only a few drops were in my oil and it's making my eyes cross now lol

9185 2018-12-31 05:53:40 The only #idiocy is the fact that we were clueless about the Tapcal Trust Fund subversion of democracy and the cheap sell off of unrefined oil while ensuring that @OilGasCanada made profits without putting down cash for the liabilities. But no problem right? Once @jkenney is in.

9188 2018-12-31 05:53:05 Becoz we the west won't allow the M.E to live in peace and prosperity. We have always aided the dictators and eliminated progressive arabic leaders. And we always will till the last drop of oil/gas is extracted.
9189 2018-12-31 05:52:58 Unfortunately not soon enough!!!. I just wish Tweeter would let me use more characters, as there are so many words in the dictionary that I want to use, because I know he isn't smart enough to understand them!.. LOL
9190 2018-12-31 05:52:50 If you knew anything about Husky, most of their production is heavy oil. They currently have 2 oilsands plants. But a lot of production is in the Lloydminster area. It's still heavy oil
9191 2018-12-31 05:52:36 Ohh got the advice at the right time from the right person. Is it ok to apply mustard oil on the abdomen for this pain ?
9192 2018-12-31 05:52:32 We was tryna make it oil cleansing cus it’s cheaper, but my pores yelling at me so I gotta get back to you on that 
9193 2018-12-31 05:52:21 Didn’t know how serious I was about frying chicken till I got in the house and well... this oil hot as fuck
9194 2018-12-31 05:52:15 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has any units near the oil field?
9195 2018-12-31 05:52:12 TIL some papers that used as food wrapping are non-recyclable. Especially if food soaked with oil. Better to compost them or burn.
9196 2018-12-31 05:52:09 kinda like our politicians. Ted Kennedy & fam for 1.
"same as it ever was". wiped server? public/private positions? forget Iraq/Libya/Haiti..

9199 2018-12-31 05:51:46 Wow. This end of the year feels so different. 

I don’t like this. AT OIL. 

Is this what growing up feels like? This ain’t fun. Who lied to us? Take me back to ‘93

About to go listen to The Pharcyde and Souls of Mischief.

9204 2018-12-31 05:50:48 The shit you toss out is as old as that oil you dig up. Old and out of date... Now you know why gas is cheap, because people like Musk, is putting your oil industry out of business... You are a dinosaur dude, living in an age of the neanderthal, you speak like one. JT PM 2019 :-)
9205 2018-12-31 05:50:40 just a guess but kali uchis probably smell like one of them essential oil bottles (just a guess)
9206 2018-12-31 05:50:07 If you dont like fish, then chicken is fabulous, and there are a million easy ways to cook it.  Baked is my go-to: ten minutes to prep with olive oil and simple spices, 20 minutes in the oven.  Goes with any and all veggies.

9209 2018-12-31 05:49:35 It’s the UN frameworks that are destroying it.  We can refine that oil here.  This current government has killed the wheat industry and marijuana industry and the oil industry.

9212 2018-12-31 05:49:28 I doubt the @liberal_party has failed us. We're doing well. The debt will be paid down. Families getting helps they need. Why you so negative? Small businesses aren't suffering. Only fail is buying that pipeline for @OilGasCanada but then all political parties puppets to oil.

9215 2018-12-31 05:48:41 The story of China execute corrupt leaders is becoming an irony!Pls,  tell me how many of d corrupt Chinese claiming to buy our oil and steal,store it in their storage has been executed?Chinese are one of d most corrupt on earth.every developed country has 45-50% corrupt wealth

9217 2018-12-31 05:48:36 I'm continually baffled by the thought process that informs the position of 'if you argue for any environmental reforms, you're not allowed to consume any oil product'.

9231 2018-12-31 05:45:52 Prayer...

9240 2018-12-31 05:44:13 What about increase in trade deficit, decline in foreign direct investment, and depreciation in rupee from 99 to 127 under PML n. Crazy borrowing and unchanged unemployment rates. All this happened when oil prices were at the lowest rate and there was hypo inflation
9241 2018-12-31 05:44:06 Does not work!!! First thing I tried. The backing is sanded particle mounting board.
Oddly, E6000 glue works sometimes; I'm starting to think that it works when some of the oil leaks to the back of the paper. Because sometimes that temp glue stick stuff kids use in school works.
9242 2018-12-31 05:44:04 That clean tarry sandy pit oil NEEDS to come out of the ground sooner rather than later, because there are NO cheaper/cleaner ways of getting petroleum anywhere else in the world! Makes ToTAL economic sense! Canada doesn’t need to be reserving/hoarding its oil stash. Got green!

9250 2018-12-31 05:43:13 @CBDivaHealth bah I can not say enough good things about CBD oil!!!! A month ago I stopped taking antidepressants,lorazepam,atavan and zoplicone. I switched you CBD oil,b12 and st.johns wort for my BPD ,anxiety and depression guys it was the best choice I ever made!
9251 2018-12-31 05:43:12 Loosely: peel several lemons and oranges, add a cup of sugar, then muddle the peels to break up all the oil pocketed in the skins. Let it sit around for a few hours; it’ll do most of the work for you, but you can re-muddle as needed.
9252 2018-12-31 05:43:03 Should just pump money into foreign oil markets.....

9255 2018-12-31 05:42:27 OH Geez why am I not surprised Climate change Obongo " Suddenly we are the biggest oil producer that was me people Say thank you."  #Frauds! It's so bad it's hard to not believe it's not comedy!
9256 2018-12-31 05:42:13 Hang on a minute. No, it's gone and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.

9261 2018-12-31 05:41:11 A truly unscientific statement, to the point of being laughable. Those societies could descend into complete anarchy, despotism, even genocide. But there is no effect on us unless we allow it.

Unfortunately, one of the sides is trying its damnedest to make sure that we allow it.
9262 2018-12-31 05:41:07 Okay, well, a kale salad is a brighter prospect than a kale smoothie. Vinegar, oil, salt and pepper, huh? Sounds like a winning dressing for any salad.
9263 2018-12-31 05:40:44 Also, that’s the true trick of the air fryer. Add just a little fat. Even a half tablespoon of oil tossed with whatever you’re making really sinches the deal and is still healthier

9265 2018-12-31 05:40:30 Guys, should we start asking for oil changes from girls? For all the times we’re in our cars driving everywhere.

9268 2018-12-31 05:40:06 When the price of oil collapses and the CIA works full time to destroy your economy this is the result. Same old playbook use in Chile, tried in Cuba, ...
9269 2018-12-31 05:40:01 Everyone KNOWS that despite the low price of oil that a pipeline would’ve been TOTALLY worth building and it would’ve been used and the sandy oil would’ve been refined in and stayed in Canada and the government wouldn’t have had to subsidize anything at all at taxpayers expense!
9270 2018-12-31 05:40:01 Turner Valley was 25 years before Leduc. I didn't see Canadian oil companies wildcatting

9272 2018-12-31 05:39:55 Which would own all the oil.  I forgot that part.

Who might back this? China. India. Shia are no threat to them.

Who would oppose it? Israel. USA. Turkey as it unifies Kurds outside Turkey & arms them as Sunni-Shia peacekeepers.

EU, Pakistan, RU, could live with it either way.
9273 2018-12-31 05:39:48 You could discard all your oil based products.....

How come the people always telling other people how to live are never willing to make changes themselves?

9276 2018-12-31 05:39:35 We are indeed grateful to PRC for investing in infrastructure projects in Pakistan. However, missing investment is the oil and gas exploration sector. It seems like investment in the safer return oriented projects only. Will there be sizeable investment in the higher risk sector.
9277 2018-12-31 05:39:28 @TheTedAllen On #Chopped’s #HollyJollyGrandmas episode, you had the story of the miracle of Hanukkah 1/2right. You had the timing of oil right but the Jews weren’t wandering in the desert, we had just taken back the Holy Temple & there was only enough oil for 1d but it lasted 8.
9278 2018-12-31 05:39:17 Drudge focuses on campaign finance. The author disclosed that he used to work with Sirota. 

My main issue with Beto is that he voted to lift the decades old oil export ban and expedite infrastructure and pipelines to export. That fueled the Permian boom. And etc.

9289 2018-12-31 05:37:55 No it's not,javas nakawa is at city oil after you cross spear motors before Kyambogo...it's actually the head office of javas
9290 2018-12-31 05:37:51 Low fire. Extreme hot oil ndio inafanya zikae shrivelled.
9291 2018-12-31 05:37:42 Alafu hii story ya watu wa Nairobi wakienda ocha kubeba paketi mbili za unga ngano na litre mbili za cooking oil then siku ya kurudi wanabeba 90kg ya mahindi,40kg ya maharagwe ,kuku mbili,viazi gunia,then wanaacha ksh 500. Hiyo kutuzoea tumekataa !!!! Hiyo hesabu haiingiani
9292 2018-12-31 05:37:41 can’t wait to run my man a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat him w/ a belt 
9293 2018-12-31 05:37:40 The final #BusinessExpress981 episode of 2018 on @Smooth981FM with @adeboboyeolamid of @armengage looking at the equity market performance for the year (hint: it wasn't good), PMI for November, and outlook for oil in the new year. Tune in at 6:45am
9294 2018-12-31 05:37:36 Past the friend on my. profle pic is actually older and a former miss aust works she taught me twenty years ago about kale oil lol its amazing shit we all need to eat it more as well. I grow it. Nic is 49
9295 2018-12-31 05:37:23 So basically what the #Ontario MPP's are saying is that @fordnation is Tywin Lannister. He shits oil. I mean gold. I mean...wait, what?
9296 2018-12-31 05:37:17 I like kale. And just like raw kale with vinegar, oil and salt and pepper. Smoothies can fuck off, tho.
9297 2018-12-31 05:37:12 Isn’t that Walter Willet working for Harvard? Oh well.. they’ve lost their marbles since the poison Coconut oil.. Let’s feed them the ropes, they’ll hang themselves...   
9298 2018-12-31 05:36:51 I've been taking it as an oil with much the same result :/
9299 2018-12-31 05:36:51 Group is getting pretty small now.
9300 2018-12-31 05:36:47 Great re-tweet from Brad, who thinks oil extraction should be stopped now. Which could be an interesting discussion, when you consider, California has the dirtiest oil in NA  and nothing is being done about it. Cap and trade hids it and many other dirty industries. C’mon, Brad.
9301 2018-12-31 05:36:45 yeah, but just regular oven, not convection. to fry in a reg oven you need some kind of oil or everything is cooked & bland as shit. no crispy goody fryness
9302 2018-12-31 05:36:42 But what will the human-made world look like a few decades beyond Peak Oil? Will we see a fulfillment of the Arts and Crafts ideal? It would be nice to think so.
9303 2018-12-31 05:35:52 Yay!!! Thank you God and thank you CBD oil! . I’m so so happy you are getting relief. Woohoo!!! 
9304 2018-12-31 05:35:51 New year's resolutions I probably won't keep:

• remember to actually get oil changed
• find a therapist / psychiatrist
• get medicated
• work remotely
• move out
9305 2018-12-31 05:35:25 Mama said don’t have nobody think that you need em so Lil Deuce go get em!! that’s when that boy turned evil, that boy slicker than oil, on point like a needle 
9306 2018-12-31 05:34:56 You're not ugly.Try a mixture of coconut oil and coco butter.
9307 2018-12-31 05:34:32 Oh it's so beautiful!! I love the yearly overview that tells you when to do things like get an oil change!
9308 2018-12-31 05:34:27 Watching toy story 3 and drankin this oil , chilling
9309 2018-12-31 05:34:08 Dead set I did preschool with Senator Watt just haven't aged like him lol yet kale oil is the key ok your face trust me y'all
9310 2018-12-31 05:34:06 We are near the top of Independence Pass in Colorado. Our cabin is drafty and 100 years old. And our power is off all the time. But we have oil lamps and can keep warm with our stove burners. As long as the propane holds out we are good. I enjoy the dark evenings.
9311 2018-12-31 05:33:55 Anyone remember going to @KFCAustralia and you were served by an adult, your chicken was cooked by an adult and the store was run by an adult. Today there is not 2 Fuks given. Just had a piece of chicken that leaked 750 mil of oil. First visit for a while and last #WANGARATTA
9312 2018-12-31 05:33:51 Maybe the Alberta Oil industry should have invested more of their profit in PR to counter bad press and build pipelines 10 years ago to handle capacity forcasts. It's a tough business, grow a pair. Oil will rebound, I hope Alberta puts away for next rainy day, instead of cryin.
9313 2018-12-31 05:33:48 ang mahal naman nun tea tree oil na to for 10ml parang di gusto nun skin ko hahaha
9314 2018-12-31 05:33:42 Mid night oil....Australia...

9316 2018-12-31 05:33:04 Cosrx oil free
9317 2018-12-31 05:32:57 Don't really get it but to be fair, there are a large group of fans out there who appreciate the die-hard/team can do no wrong angle. To each his own but it's difficult to take them serious.
9318 2018-12-31 05:32:46 難しすぎます笑
8月20日は違いますか……？
(少しもの希望を……)

好きな回は10月23日のadd oilの回です！それは、ただ、add oilという語感が好きなだけです笑
9319 2018-12-31 05:32:40 oh god no please not coconut oil
9320 2018-12-31 05:32:39 Being fresh from the beach, showering and slathering coconut oil lotion on is good energy. 
9321 2018-12-31 05:32:38 Considering we wouldn't have any oilpatch if not for the Americans. Same as the UK and US developed Saudi oil before being kicked out
9322 2018-12-31 05:32:36 Some things are funnier than juggling feral cats soaked in used engine oil while playing with a lit blowtorch.
9323 2018-12-31 05:32:36 @PMonica1028 Wife:few week after oil massage my hair and milk &icecream massage my heels and leg and pedicure my heels.

Taught a workshop at my alma mater and immediately was asked back to guest teach for a semester.

9330 2018-12-31 05:32:04 Explains why they like Socialism then. Haven’t seen the final solution.
9331 2018-12-31 05:32:01 The Huns are now messaging me telling me that so and so essential oil will cure my shingles. Please shut up and go away and never speak again until you grow a brain. That's some stupid lies you are spouting off about. Lies which could make something medical 10 times worse.
9332 2018-12-31 05:31:57 No point to it, Mark. A small party by comparison had full force Britnat media , unionists from all over UK and beyond telling us we couldn't use the £, get into EU, oil running out etc They did remarkable well & produced a 600+ page book. We'll win next time! People see UK lies
9333 2018-12-31 05:31:44 LESS THAN 4% OF OLIVE OIL CONSUMED IN THE U.S. IS PRODUCED IN THE U.S.   MOST OLIVE OIL COMES FROM MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES.  99% OF DOMESTIC OIL COMES FROM CALIFORNIA.

9334 2018-12-31 05:31:36 Ujiyare is worth 9+ crores. AAP candidate. Ex RM of oil company. Far from being a farmer
9335 2018-12-31 05:31:29 Their oil rich brothers in the Arabian peninsula have neglected them. We would not have to grudge them from our prayers.
9336 2018-12-31 05:31:11 Also, some vape shops you’ll have to check would have CBD hemp oil stuff.
9337 2018-12-31 05:31:07 Oh so national oil companies are ok?
9338 2018-12-31 05:30:50 Naija..the land of generals without war, politicians without ideology, criminals without fears, history without glory, change without progress, next level without foundation, integrity without performance, positions without qualification, oil without refinery.

9344 2018-12-31 05:30:06 Psalm 23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over .
9345 2018-12-31 05:29:49 And where did you come up with brilliant observation?
9346 2018-12-31 05:29:40 popped my pimple and put tea tree oil on it this is a fucking self care day !!!
9347 2018-12-31 05:29:35 Feel bad for all those resale tix that never got sold. Must be similar to Lucas Oil Stadium.
9348 2018-12-31 05:29:33 BP claims an oil spill of Australia's coast would be a 'welcome boost' to local economies. Perhaps next we will hear that collapsing towers, car crashes or people shooting themselves in the foot are all 'welcome boosts' to the local economies.
9349 2018-12-31 05:29:32 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
9350 2018-12-31 05:29:28 McCarthy and Baker will mix as good as water and oil. Don't do this
9351 2018-12-31 05:29:15 We are still a top 10 emitter of CO2 though. Agreed that other nations are bigger contributors and also need to do more. But doing nothing still isn't good. Getting more oil supply will put downward pressure on global price which will slow market for alternative energy adoption.
9352 2018-12-31 05:29:13 By 2009, Iraq was very quiet. 

Putative ZOG Neocon overlords would have taken the opportunity to start pumping free oil in quantity. 

The actual WASP State and CIA apparatchiks running things took the opportunity to hand the place over to IS, after creating it in Syria.
9353 2018-12-31 05:29:00 I use the Noodle & Boo elasticity oil and I don’t have a special lotion for stretch marks. I switch back and forth between Lubriderm advanced therapy lotion, I bought a huge bottle, and Nivea daily shea moisture!
9354 2018-12-31 05:28:58 What separates my beard oil from all the other oils are the places of orgin of my oil leaves. A southern hemisphere of Jojoba & Argan leaves that's earthly formulated with the "highest value properties" that's grown in prime climates for "maximum benefit remedies". Get yours now!
9355 2018-12-31 05:28:57 A nice full body massage with some warm oil sounds so good right now

According to Dr. Gupta:
1. Ignore sugar
2. Mix lemon fruit with a glass of hot water and drink first thing before food.
3. Drink 3 table spoons of organic coconut oil, morning and night.
4. Share this

9361 2018-12-31 05:27:55 それで遅刻したのか
9362 2018-12-31 05:27:47 In my humble opinion, the Oil are going to regret dumping Caggiula. Inconsistent? Yes. Really young? Yes. Always liked how he played bigger than he was.
9363 2018-12-31 05:27:31 Coconut oil, African black soap, rose water, Jamaican black Castor oil, water in general
9364 2018-12-31 05:27:22 (WHAT?) AT 4,000CALORIES PER POUND,  OLIVE OIL IS MUCH MORE CALORIE-DENSE THAN SUGAR).
   
    JUST BECAUSE AN OLIVE OIL IS FROM ITALY, GREEECE OR CALIFORNIA DOESN’T MEAN THAT IT’S SUPERIOR IN QUALITY.
9365 2018-12-31 05:27:19 Do you mean carbon dioxide pollution? Because a lot of people are talking about sewage which is a problem but is not causing climate change. Thank you for putting a price on carbon but we need to stop increasing oil production and use more renewable energy.
9366 2018-12-31 05:27:10 Oil Change season 9 would be super entertaining this week... #oilers #HereComeTheOilers
9367 2018-12-31 05:26:57 Gotta have a ceremony to start off the year completed with oil lamps and Kiribath. :D
9368 2018-12-31 05:26:56 Midnight Oil 
9369 2018-12-31 05:26:40 Are you making the implicit claim that OIF was somehow brought about by The Jews?

I wish it were-unlike the (undoubtedly WASPy) OEF, Vietnam war, endless US wars in Yemen, Somalia, Syria, etc., the Iraq war had a clear potential benefit (oil) and was winnable.
9370 2018-12-31 05:26:38 Only three countries in the world don’t have a national oil company. Ever consider that we are wrong? Ever consider that Alberta’s oil patch was developed by and for the benefit of Texas?
9371 2018-12-31 05:26:32 oil and corn syrup... pass.
9372 2018-12-31 05:26:29 Second only to Ted Cruz in donations from Oil & Gas industries.
Won’t fully commit to Medicare for all & his voting record isn’t good either, often voted with Trump / GOP. Beto’s been brought.
9373 2018-12-31 05:26:27 Regardless of their education levels (the downturn hit everyone), what frustrates me is that the organizers or instigators seem oblivious to the changing demand, the glut of oil, and the need for training to meet the needs of energy services now, and in the future. #abpoli #ableg
9374 2018-12-31 05:26:23 Excited to place my @younglivingeo order on Friday - dryer balls, car vent diffuser + refills, thieves hand purifier, oil & another roll on bc it's my FAVORITE!

  DOES THE QUALITY OF OLIVE OIL DEPEND ON THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN?
9379 2018-12-31 05:25:34 NYE reminder: fad diets are fads because people stop doing them, which indicates that they don’t work. Fad diets are the world’s most successful snake oil scam.
9380 2018-12-31 05:25:16 Transmutation:

Grapes must be crushed to make wine
Diamonds form under pressure
Olives are pressed to release oil
Seeds grow in darkness

Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation/transmutation.

9381 2018-12-31 05:25:03 Oil being traded in INR instead of foreign currency. Does it not help nation? Relationship with Japan and Israel will help Ambani and Adani?

9385 2018-12-31 05:24:25 or olive oil (??) imoe it makes canned foods edible again, could seem like something of a necessity for campground dinners and "frozen foods" too. am not a PhD however

9387 2018-12-31 05:24:22 Have room for the truly repentant, not some snake oil salesman who is most assuredly laughing this up with his leftist friends
9388 2018-12-31 05:24:16 This in a climate where I get shat on because my industry (technology) got some tax benefits which some said should go to helping oil fields so as to help "real" people.
9389 2018-12-31 05:24:13 idc, i neeed one. i'm allergic to veg oil
9390 2018-12-31 05:23:58 No, Pierre wanted to nationalize the oil industry. So now we would look like Venezuela

9394 2018-12-31 05:23:50 just say the words milky, mildly-toxic sap and I’m dripping in olive oil
9395 2018-12-31 05:23:31 えっ………でも今のところ無料10連で唯一ひいたSSRがバハムートなんですけどつまり闇古戦場走れよってことなんですか？ごめんむり
9396 2018-12-31 05:23:20 Agreed! It's a disgusting culture of oversharing over what r probably exaggerated & fake sob stories. I once heard a ketoquack talk about treating her late father with olive oil & how she helped him get better but that he succumbed anyway under medical care *then cries on video*

9398 2018-12-31 05:23:09 I don't see either of the major political parties imposing any sort of restriction on oil developments that don't have carbon (or human rights...) policies. As such left to the market it seems the only "competitive" solution is to do as little as possible.

9401 2018-12-31 05:22:54 i’ve eaten more truffles/truffle oil this week than the average person has in their lifetime
9402 2018-12-31 05:22:53 Yes i failed, but am gonna rise, shake off the dust, mend my torn garment,oil my bruises, and raise my head yet again. Ooh yea, watch me!

9404 2018-12-31 05:22:26 Pierre’s tinkering would have seen an energy east type pipeline built already and Canadian oil being used across Canada. Isn’t that what you bitch about now?
9405 2018-12-31 05:22:20 On mine, it would need refilling every 15,000 km. That would add $80 per oil change. And 9L of synthetic oil instead of 5L for gas engine adds $40+ per oil change. We do 10k for oil change instead of 15k because of sludge issue with engine.
Notice that savings gets whittled away.
9406 2018-12-31 05:22:17 Saw through his campaign hype and one of the tells was seeing his signs in the front yards of many oil and gas mansions. Thanks for your excellent article!
9407 2018-12-31 05:22:16 Amazing! 90 minute deep tissue with essential oil. Well worth the price. The lady that worked on me was fantastic! Will return on my next trip to Vegas!
9408 2018-12-31 05:21:56 Good
9409 2018-12-31 05:21:54 Don’t forget George HW started his own oil company after the war and Mitt Romney was entirely self made and that was probably his biggest appeal.
9410 2018-12-31 05:21:47 I need a essential oil diffuser in my life

9414 2018-12-31 05:21:17 リツイートしてくれる方、ありがとう
9415 2018-12-31 05:21:15 Idiots going on about the price of oil saying it has -nothing- to do with taxes. If taxes are less the price will be less than it would have been either way.
9416 2018-12-31 05:21:10 Everything is someone's. I'm white w/Italian/Irish ancestry. We were treated pretty poorly, but not as bad as the Brown/Yellow of the world- I get that. It's not my intent to oppress when I go to Chuys or get Kroger sushi. I try to avoid Nestle and palm oil and try new cuisine.
9417 2018-12-31 05:21:06 Simply not true. Conservatives promote increased oil drilling in the oceans and arctic, and restarting of coal-fired power plants, all the while killing the regs that could limit their pollutants. Don’t go there.

9423 2018-12-31 05:20:30 Eat my ass
9424 2018-12-31 05:20:17 How many new year celebrations are there in a year? Would you equate it to pollution from vehicles that burn oil every single day?
9425 2018-12-31 05:20:07 I get it. But reality is that our oil extraction still has non-trivial carbon footprint. I'm not seeing any inflection point that would indicate genuine plan (or even concern) on reducing dependency on fossil fuels. Do you have any idea on a timeline?
9426 2018-12-31 05:20:06 Not to worry, Trump said recently that the reason we are in the Middle East is to protect Israel & we don't need Arab oil. As I understand it, there's a plan in place so that when Israel goes to war in a big way, IDF officers will lead US troops on the ground. War games annually.
9427 2018-12-31 05:19:44 
 Today #Crude #Oil Scenario added.
9428 2018-12-31 05:19:33 My nightly routine involves The Body Shop tea tree oil collection, drunk elephant, a glass of wine and the office. Nothing beats that
9429 2018-12-31 05:19:30 Oh? I could have sworn PET was from Quebec. There was a global downturn in oil prices. But Pierre's tinkering really screwed things up
9430 2018-12-31 05:19:23 My customer was a holistic healer-entrepreneur-traveling mom. She dabbed a lil bit of oil on me & told me it was to elevate my mood. Rock on, cool mom 
9431 2018-12-31 05:19:18 Hey UT friends anyone know where I can get CBD oil pls lmk asking for a friend
9432 2018-12-31 05:19:08 I thought z was the one coming up that are supposed to be conservative.  I can’t keep up any more.

9435 2018-12-31 05:18:48 Only in certain ways are women equal in israel. LOL They must go to back of the bus. Orthodox Jews are very anti women. Isreal is getting in bed with MBS in his financial plan to not rely on oil & resolve unemployment issue. I I cld tell you things about KSA U would be stunned
9436 2018-12-31 05:18:32 I will eat more ass next year #2019 #NewYearsResolutions
9437 2018-12-31 05:18:25 I love how different mediums will affect oil paint. I can’t wait to start exploring more oils and mediums and what not
9438 2018-12-31 05:18:22 what instruments do you use to produce art like oil, charcoal, pencil, etc.
9439 2018-12-31 05:18:00 Oil paints are not for me... I had a mental breakdown because I ruined my good paintbrushes #rip
9440 2018-12-31 05:18:00 I have heard that peppermint oil works too.
9441 2018-12-31 05:17:47 最近PERFUME OIL FACTORYでお迎えした香水、「金木犀」「桜」ときて、先日新しく購入したのが「蓮」。
四季のうつくしさを綴じ込めたような香水で気に入ってる。
9442 2018-12-31 05:17:33 Sides are not cooked well, Brush it with oil before cooking
9443 2018-12-31 05:17:32 Cauliflower (roasted till almost burnt w olive oil and parm)
9444 2018-12-31 05:17:29 Millennials (essentially the same as Gen Y) are between their mid 20s and late 30s now. You're thinking of Gen Z.
9445 2018-12-31 05:17:19 After I wash my face I use I use thayers witch hazel for toner (to help with my dumb redness), then I use some sort of serum - one from the body shop or Josie marans Aegean oil, THEN I moisturize with the yellow Clinique one and my skin feels great after! Lots of steps, worth it.
9446 2018-12-31 05:17:06 "if fans of fossil fuels can’t find an effective way to address climate change, Texas will have to start dealing with problems even more destructive than an oil bust."

I'm not sure the editors understand what the stakes are. If they do then this is yet another oil soaked cop out
9447 2018-12-31 05:17:06 I'd tell her that just because she's a single mom stripper, that doesn't mean I'm slipping a dollar into her yoga pants in aisle 6 at Walmart. So she can quit shaking her ass & get outta my way because she's blocking the canola oil
9448 2018-12-31 05:17:06 Chef McElroy cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with gravy.
9449 2018-12-31 05:16:56 it's soooooo shit. Their chocolate is terrible, they use oil instead of butter, the dough is under-baked but not not in a good way. They. Are. Horrible.
9450 2018-12-31 05:16:36 They have no palm oil, which I assume helps orangutans avoid being murdered.

9452 2018-12-31 05:16:22 Data is the new oil.
9453 2018-12-31 05:16:18 Yes, my natural hair is wavy to curly. The coconut oil is good for any hair type. I used to do it every few nights years ago.
9454 2018-12-31 05:16:16 Fye!!! I forgot to give you those oil pastels damnit
9455 2018-12-31 05:16:12 He can't see heaven na
9456 2018-12-31 05:16:10 I just watched #DeepWaterHorizon, regarding the worst oil spill in US history. Struck me just how complicated & delicate #offshore drilling is. Like nuclear energy, (averaging global catastrophe per decade), we are playing with fire. #KeepItInTheGround #GoSolar #NewGreenDeal
9457 2018-12-31 05:16:04 Do Megaman mains drink oil?
9458 2018-12-31 05:15:57 So nice
9459 2018-12-31 05:15:56 Manguha ka chicken oil while gakaon pa ang gagamit. Tapos hambal mo ibalik mo lng. GAGO! Lol
9460 2018-12-31 05:15:53 China and India accounting for about 35 percent of the world’s incremental increase in oil consumption, even though they account for just 15 percent of world output. - Thomas L Friedman
9461 2018-12-31 05:15:50 I can’t watch it again , she’s so stiff she needs some cod liver oil
9462 2018-12-31 05:15:35 Oil based primer
9463 2018-12-31 05:15:16 One cannot do without tea and cookies! Like the sun and the moon! Water and oil!
9464 2018-12-31 05:15:10 Teachers don't set the curriculum, bureaucrats do.
9465 2018-12-31 05:15:00 Vilma Lusardi's Delizie, our family's line of pasta sauce and olive oil are available for sale at our restaurant!
9466 2018-12-31 05:14:51 Nice
9467 2018-12-31 05:14:48 Last, ABs interests are more diverse than O&G. No one should want to see education, healthcare, or program cuts just because oil is in a downswing. It doesn't represent enough of ABs overall economy to warrant it. I wasn't initially a fan, but Notley has been driving admirably
9468 2018-12-31 05:14:47 You might say these are trifling matters. You’re right, they are, but these trifles are the oil, the fuel we need to keep our flame alive and our light shining. 

St. Josemaria
9469 2018-12-31 05:14:30 Gonna throw enough engine oil to keep an RX7 running for a week down your throat

9473 2018-12-31 05:13:58 And yes Sarah Jennifer Adriana and Clorisa are angry with me for wanting to put them in Jerusalem on a Kashrut diet fish oil softgels and Tshirts with I'm Jassasa on them while I hide in a missile silo base checking my tv to see if my plan worked and they attracted 7.6 billion
9474 2018-12-31 05:13:55 Worst. oil. ever.

9477 2018-12-31 05:13:46 Sunday Riley’s UFO oil! It’s amazing.
9478 2018-12-31 05:13:23 Honestly rosehip oil works wonders for my skin! It moisturizes without making you feel greasy afterwards!!! You can get it from Marshall’s for like $5 and I swear by it
9479 2018-12-31 05:13:14 How to serve a bottle of oil: Book 3
9480 2018-12-31 05:13:01 Stocks plunged as Corning Incorporated unveiled a lame bottle of oil today.
9481 2018-12-31 05:13:00 Perhaps mention that the oil and gas companies are dictating the GOP message. Koch Industries deserves a mention for the Corrupt Cabinet that was chosen.
9482 2018-12-31 05:12:58 Yes Iran certainly was more liberal but there was also a lot of corruption and poverty in the country. The liberal urban Iranians were outnumbered by many who were not sharing in the country's oil wealth. Western powers indulged the Shah and courted him but oil wealth went west.
9483 2018-12-31 05:12:44 お兄さんに挨拶完了しました。
9484 2018-12-31 05:12:06 Timeの向こう側はoilなのか……？

9487 2018-12-31 05:11:09 Watch Carly Humberto’s journey with accutane on YouTube! I’ve done two rounds. Loved the results and my face was oil free. But the oil and acne came back after I stopped.
9488 2018-12-31 05:10:57 can’t wait to like,

9496 2018-12-31 05:10:13 Only two male kittens— one black, one brown— remain, the others already adopted out to new homes. “They’re brothers. Oil and water, the both of ‘em, but they’ve got their own charms and are almost inseparable. Good luck.”
9497 2018-12-31 05:10:10 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
9498 2018-12-31 05:10:07 maybe just another Oil war...and Syria's gas
9499 2018-12-31 05:10:05 maybe if my parents threatened me with a pizza party, I’d remember to check the oil levels in my car
9500 2018-12-31 05:09:57 art type basically skkdks like my mediums are digital, markers, and oil paimts
9501 2018-12-31 05:09:51 Snake oil salesmen, no man or woman should need another human being to motivate them, if u cannot motivate yourself what makes u think another person can. U succeed or Fail in life because u chose to. Paying a con man to assist u is just a waste of money n energy.
9502 2018-12-31 05:09:44 Sustainable development of oil palm,  or of forest management, are oxymoronic phrases
9503 2018-12-31 05:09:42 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President when will the Keystone XL pipeline commence construction?  Delays under your administration similar to delays under Obama'a administration?  Judicial delays preventing US refiners from accessing Cdn heavy oil to generate profits and jobs - nonsense.
9504 2018-12-31 05:09:27 Do you know earlier stc has monopoly to import Pam oil. And there was agent who take 3% .and this 3% was for Cong ministers .
9505 2018-12-31 05:09:23 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
9506 2018-12-31 05:09:17 A thriving oil industry can only help support Ontario’s #RingofFire much stainless steel is used in the oil industry, but what do you care about the #ringoffire or good paying jobs in Northern Ontario. Seems you have nothing positive to offer other than name calling.  
9507 2018-12-31 05:09:14 My room smells like Shea butter made with melted caramel cookie dough coconut oil & extra vanilla extract

9513 2018-12-31 05:07:49 Energy, strength & creativity is not enough.  Some pretty bad people have had all of those traits.  We need leaders with "compassion" who value life (all life) above profit.  We need leaders who serve the common good instead of the bottom line for oil and big pharma.
9514 2018-12-31 05:07:45 They love their seasonings and dressings. 
Most wouldn’t have a salad without some sort of oil on it

No. You think only about yourself !!
9521 2018-12-31 05:06:32 What is “the work” - collecting big donor $ & crafting corporate-friendly policies? We needed Medicare for All; we didn’t even get a public option. We needed decarbonization & a Green New Deal. What we got from Obama: “suddenly America is the largest oil producer – that was me…”
9522 2018-12-31 05:06:20 “You need to stop getting out of bed like an oil spill. You’re not a flat tire at 2am, so stop acting like an accident”
9523 2018-12-31 05:06:11 Repair your own country like #Flint spend money on medicare for all! Instead of spending more than 50% of your tax dollars on the military and bombing other countries for #Oil and for companies like @Raytheon @LockheedMartin @BoeingDefense to profit ! #BDS
9524 2018-12-31 05:05:58 Technically, an oil rig can be registered as a ship.  Ten miles out, and it’s in international waters. IE: no tax! It’s like it’s own little banking World. That’s why cruise ships are registered in Bermuda, not Southampton. Carnival way. Tax dodge.
9525 2018-12-31 05:05:50 Either that or sniffing to many oil fumes.
9526 2018-12-31 05:05:46 That combo is as great as Castor Oil a raw egg and pies...Stand By Me reference .
9527 2018-12-31 05:05:40 Candles lit, Showered, face exfoliated, coconut oil rub up pon my body 

Oooh weee!

Self love is so important 
9528 2018-12-31 05:05:28 Wash out cupboard with soapy water then spray with peppermint oil with vinegar
9529 2018-12-31 05:05:15 YES 1/2 cup would be one half banan u are welcome BUT HOW THE FUCK DO U NOT HAVE BUTTER OR OIL BUT BANANAS
9530 2018-12-31 05:05:10 (olive oil IS A vegetable oil)
9531 2018-12-31 05:05:07 That’s what you get for bullying the world for decades, changing regimes, overthrowing legitimate governments because they don’t serve your oil interest and waging war killing hundreds of thousands for your weapon industry interest. You deserve worse, karma is a bitch.
9532 2018-12-31 05:04:55 My issue wasn't the mustard it was the oil in the pasta water. The end result looked pretty tasty!
9533 2018-12-31 05:04:50 Good news for motorists! Metro Oil lowers fuel prices:

9534 2018-12-31 05:04:47 Off work fuc round n got on this oil  up
9535 2018-12-31 05:04:37 At least you don’t have to tell the clerk those boxes are ‘olive oil’ or ‘hot sauce’ or bbq sauce’ 
9536 2018-12-31 05:04:30 I have CBD oil and @KailLowry’s CBD infused @potheadhair hair care on the way and I’m so excited!! 
9537 2018-12-31 05:04:28 We are beside ourself with jubilance.  Papaw was imbibing joyously already for the new year, once he awakes, he will be full of grace and joy, but Memaw and I are already furiously making more raccoon oil for the boys. The weather now makes their urine strong.  Best and Godspeed
9538 2018-12-31 05:04:06 That was the  moment western corporations and their govt's found oil in them thar sand dunes. The UK US and France have always backed the most backward most violent and most recalcitrant dictators to oppress the people and steal resources.
9539 2018-12-31 05:04:02 Oil gave untold wealth to people like Osama who were subsequently kicked out of Saudi Arabia to pursue evil in shitholes?
9540 2018-12-31 05:03:58 Do you really object to a candidate taking money from the Nurses Union? I certainly don't. Nurses are a force for good. That's an entirely different thing than taking money from Big Pharma, Oil, Wall Street, etc. Seems kind of petty to object to donations from Nurses.
9541 2018-12-31 05:03:53 フーファンのフレンドが欲しい……なにとぞ
9542 2018-12-31 05:03:48 Yea I sip oil, my bitch look like a doll.

9545 2018-12-31 05:03:35 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
9546 2018-12-31 05:03:31 All these numbers would improve more if we were moving more of our oil
9547 2018-12-31 05:03:20 Got my diffuser running that lavender oil rn it’s game time 
9548 2018-12-31 05:03:17 Castor oil
9549 2018-12-31 05:03:14 Also start using coconut oil on your body and as a way to loosen your face before you apply your moisturizer. I used it during my radiation treatments and it worked miracles
9550 2018-12-31 05:02:56 do u have . vegetable oil

9552 2018-12-31 05:02:39 Just finished The Patch by @theturner I truly nuanced and fascinating story of Alberta’s oil and gas sector. I can’t recommend it more #AbLeg
9553 2018-12-31 05:02:32 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
9554 2018-12-31 05:02:00 Manager gave nearly everyone the day off so we were understaffed and no one ordered a delivery so we had limited oil to make things in so I had to cook clean and prep
9555 2018-12-31 05:01:53 Kyot ng pa oil ni meng eh hahaha. Pero masama talaga pakiramdam nya pero ang sipag nya haay iba ka meng

9556 2018-12-31 05:01:51 Oil prices are down globally due to oversupply hence the lower gas prices.  Prices are expected to rise in 2019 as OPEC cuts production.  It has nothing to do with Ford or the PC party but I am certain he wouldn't hesitate to take credit for it.

카이토 : 나라마다 다르겠지? :D
메이코 : 바카이토... 오일이라구 (Oil)
9566 2018-12-31 05:00:14 Nah, it's more the part where they blame everyone but themselves for failing to invest oil money properly. Now that oil is sold at $40/barrel they cry about how all the jobs are leaving, then blame immigrants and Trudeau.

9569 2018-12-31 05:00:03 i was sad so i took an hour shower and drowned my body in coconut oil. i’m contempt :)
9570 2018-12-31 04:59:59 No subsidies to buy Prius and those boring cars run on fossils. I couldn’t resist buying a car partly paid for by the Canadian oil industry. So Tesla.
9571 2018-12-31 04:59:26 1. Not really.  The population of Alberta is the same as Oregon and larger than Connecticut, Oklahoma and Iowa.  Add Saskatchewan and its between South Carolina and Minnesota.  Add a Texas-equivalent oil patch and there will be more than enough attention given.
9572 2018-12-31 04:59:23 made a giant tupperware of baked chicken with whole wheat pasta in a garlic olive oil sauce w/ peas. Fiber, Protein and whatever garlic does :p prepare abs!

9574 2018-12-31 04:59:21 So stupid that THC oil is a felony in Florida ruining my vacation.
9575 2018-12-31 04:59:20 do y’all know any good straightening oil? i cant find a good enough one that keeps my hair shiny and keeps it from fizzing.
9576 2018-12-31 04:59:02 No exception to this statement whatsoever.
9577 2018-12-31 04:58:59 Isn’t there an oil for that 
9578 2018-12-31 04:58:54 Perhaps the world needs a major oil crisis like the Saudi embargo that forced Dutch politicians to deal with fallout by going back to basics - bicycles. It transformed their transport policy. Britain is way too comfortable, complacent. Still, everything is possible!...Brexit?
9579 2018-12-31 04:58:44 u can use butter or coconut oil as a replacement

9582 2018-12-31 04:58:30 The people that care about the climate aren't in a position to do anything about it, 
the people doing things "for the climate" are 100% enriching or empowering themselves, either directly or indirectly.
9583 2018-12-31 04:58:28 It still pisses me off that oil floats on water, that shouldn't be allowed.

9586 2018-12-31 04:58:10 It's actually hurting grassroots oil+gas support movement. Companies are now backing out + not letting their trucks into any legit events as these yellow vesters just show up + take over the event with their crazy. If media + public mix them into one movement, Greenpeace wins.
9587 2018-12-31 04:58:08 夏まで貯め込んでおきます(笑)
9588 2018-12-31 04:58:05 -steam your face. you could do this by turning on the hot water in your shower and just sit in it. 
-use tea tree oil. put a little onto a q tip and dabbing it onto the  effected area. 
-drink a lot of water. i know this sounds like something stupid, but it works.
9589 2018-12-31 04:58:04 The best way to combat that dryness would be to go into a sauna but I assume that’s pretty hard to get into these days. Another thing would be an intense fireplace but that’s pretty difficult to do unless you love a cool workout with consistent woodcutting routine to have oil. – bij Rattlesnake Bar Folsom Lake
9590 2018-12-31 04:57:57 An awesome ex girlfriend commissioned an oil portrait of herself and it’s badass!

9598 2018-12-31 04:57:08 My aunt had a bad one and I put her onto Rick Simpson's Oil. She used it in combination with chemo. She never lost her hair and got to a point where she could have the surgery she needed. Doctors were asking what else she was taking bc chemo never worked like that. Go figure...

9600 2018-12-31 04:56:49 are you  forgetting it was decades of pc govt in this province that failed to diversify the economy and left us vulnerable to oil shocks? You are going to be disappointed IF Kenney wins b/c he won’t be able to get pipelines built any faster.
9601 2018-12-31 04:56:33 This is dependent on location and might be cost/time prohibitive, but try looking for stores where you can bring your own containers to fill up. You'd be surprised at what's out there - nut butters, honey, olive oil, popcorn, grains, spices, loose tea, castille soap, vinegar, etc

9611 2018-12-31 04:55:42 Tells you about money? How?

Oil and gas is already supposedly very profitable, besides all of the government subsidies and bailouts. Who's bullying oil and gas?

9623 2018-12-31 04:54:20 Fact check, please.  Lots of incorrect reporting says Beto took funds from oil/gas industry, but not true.  Took money from individuals working in those industries.  It’s Texas - that’s a big segment of economy.  You have something else?

9633 2018-12-31 04:53:06 coconut oil is what i use in the mornings and it seems to help them stay moisturized for a while so maybe something with that in it might be helpful
9634 2018-12-31 04:53:03 True. Compare the prices. Simply ask the price of AXE Oil from STO pharmacy you will see this.
9635 2018-12-31 04:52:56 sometimes I'm so lame and just smoke my juul and oil pen and play animal crossing  like I'm an adult, I swear

9639 2018-12-31 04:52:40 Do you think Trump has ever:

Owned a toolbox?
Hooked up a car stereo system?
Helped a neighbor move?
Barbecued ribs?
Changed his cars oil?
Built a campfire?
Hung a picture?
Changed a diaper?
Read a book?

Isn't it creepy that it's very believable that he's done NONE of these?
9640 2018-12-31 04:52:33 How one wishes that the Islamic world does not take this lying down. All Islamic countries should come together and give a spirited response to this Chinese oppression. Ban Chinese investments and goods in your Islamic countries. Don't sell any crude oil or natural gas to them.
9641 2018-12-31 04:52:32 Any Oil fan with half a brain will realize that any new GM will be inheriting a shitty diaper. If any "real" Oil fan blames a new GM for the current problems. Then they are fucking idiots.

9653 2018-12-31 04:50:31 As I said to Cody: The UK. Small lump of mud in a big world. Basic building blocks.. how do we sell stuff in the big wide world? Our greatest asset is knowledge, rather than coal, oil, etc. Go to school and learn. It’s a business thing.
9654 2018-12-31 04:50:21 The last few years have been fairly dry unfortunately but I also haven’t had to deal with the issues in having now. So I’m just biting the bullet and when I have my oil production where I need it, I’ll get one final haircut and start growing my hat healthy again. Hopefully
9655 2018-12-31 04:50:10 Whatever you do, don’t go to Denver in the winter. I spent a week there in November for a national championship & almost DIED. 

Dehydrated Sponge Bob. Tyrone Biggums. All the water, Pedialyte & coconut oil in the world was not saving me.

9666 2018-12-31 04:49:03 finna get on this oil 
9667 2018-12-31 04:49:00 The funny thing, @anasalhajji , is that the more oil falls (as it will in Q1 for TARS and a hard Brexit), the more likely TX will be driven into Dems' arms and the more pressure Cruz will feel to appease his oil masters. Hence DJT's panicked tweets in mid year for HIGHER prices!
9668 2018-12-31 04:48:49 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
9669 2018-12-31 04:48:37 clearly you dont understand how this works. taking the heavy oil out of line 1 increases the fuels transported to bc. basic economics bill.
9670 2018-12-31 04:48:31 You go @GailVazOxlade - what a bunch of crap.   Has nothing to do with him has to do with the oil prices in Alberta and the global market

9674 2018-12-31 04:46:50 Yup.  Dowless seems like a slippery sleazy snake oil salesman.  Crooked as a dog’s leg, as my grandma would say.

Pittenger seemed to know that. 

Why didn’t Harris?  Or did he?
9675 2018-12-31 04:46:43 Very soon we will see the crude oil level 3500 now LTP is 3219

9678 2018-12-31 04:46:18 He bought the fucking pipeline. He is sure seems like he’s trying to destroy the oil industry. Didn’t I ask you about oil workers and drug testing? You better watch yourself before you get caught.
9679 2018-12-31 04:46:13 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
9680 2018-12-31 04:46:13 Yeah It's so nuts like venezuela oil the world could use but starving people & UN breathes down our neck it's BS We should have conditions like Stop starving your people stop slave labor or we Rcutting off money as it's not going 2help improve conditions 4the people&TheyComeHere.
9681 2018-12-31 04:46:11 What kind of car is it and what year? I can text him and ask him what it will cost. He replaced my fuel pump and did an oil change for like 200$ and took 2 days

9687 2018-12-31 04:45:31 FYI. Most of those trucks/rigs are run by small business owners already paying out of their own pockets. So if you look at the crowds you have more than 5. Random guess a little close to 50000. Just saying.
9688 2018-12-31 04:45:14 Scheer will get rid of the carbon tax & get pipelines going again, for starters. If the oil sector is killed, Ottawa will lose billions which now contribute to equalization. If Trudo stays in power, we will be under a socialist regime, You will lose a lot of freedoms you have now
9689 2018-12-31 04:45:12 I need to write a book. Seriously. Between all the disabilities that I deal with, the foods I cannot eat, etc... But yeah, I down organic tart cherry juice, take a Tumeric supp, flax seed oil, etc....

9693 2018-12-31 04:44:48 Outside Lucas Oil Stadium after the 2-5 Colts beat the Bills, a guy was screaming “ were going to the playoffs!!!” everyone’s reaction was priceless including mine. Little did I know...

9696 2018-12-31 04:44:21 Before May of this year I had a very strong oil production and my hair would really benefit. I could wash every day without an issue but once I fried it with keratin unknowingly I started using other oils (coconut and argan) which tricked my scalp into thinking it didn’t need oil
9697 2018-12-31 04:43:58 We’ll be bringing the squirrel oil! 
9698 2018-12-31 04:42:59 There’s nothing like applying that thin layer of coconut oil on your face after your nightly routine 
9699 2018-12-31 04:42:48 Maybe get them some cauldrons for boiling oil? Set up a trebuchet or a mangonel, to assist in repelling the darkie threat.
I hear crossbows are making a comeback. And gibbets, for repeat but minor offenders.
9700 2018-12-31 04:42:48 It's neet how the msm ignores our 87% coal oil and gas consumption. While raving about the 2% renewable supply and it's tiny growth   did they all fail basic math  @FriendsOScience

9703 2018-12-31 04:42:25 Here's the thing: nobody gives a fuck. We don't care if 1/10 of 1% of his campaign funds came from oil execs or he took some votes we don't like. Sane people have bigger things to worry about. So knock yourself out with the smears. Bernie will never be the nominee!
9704 2018-12-31 04:42:24 Hi Kingsley. We’re sorry to learn that your service experience with Audi hasn’t met your expectations. It’s important to note that both oil and water/coolant are consumables, which means that the mileage travelled and driving conditions experienced even after a service...(1/3)
9705 2018-12-31 04:42:17 Change oil wahahahahah
9706 2018-12-31 04:42:15 For about a month or two I actually quit towel drying & just kinda blotted the hair to avoid rubbing but it was kinda long, making it look like it wasn’t even styled - which it wasn’t. 
It’s just stripping the oils & moisture from the hair really gets to it - why I need more oil
9707 2018-12-31 04:42:13 Lol @ 14 days. When i leave butter out while i’m cooking it starts to melt. No way in hell its lasting two weeks outside of a fridge. Might as well call it oil at that point.
9708 2018-12-31 04:42:05 Nooooo .. I had that all over Christmas. Fair to say that it pretty much ruined it. Get some clove oil if you can 
9709 2018-12-31 04:41:59 She is thinking how disappointed she is that your husband relaxed regulations on protecting fish and opened up the waters off the West coast for oil exploration which will kill thousands of her relatives.
9710 2018-12-31 04:41:51 Snake oil...
9711 2018-12-31 04:41:39 I have a sink question...  Does anyone have one of those soap squirters built into their sink? What do you put in yours, dish soap? Hand soap? Sriracha? Rum? Avocado oil?
9712 2018-12-31 04:41:31 I only lube with snake oil.
9713 2018-12-31 04:41:30 She needs some holy oil and sage
9714 2018-12-31 04:41:11 I thinking We don't need a HD that feels it's his way or no way we just fired one of those. I also think Baker and McCarthy will mix like water and oil Come on Dorsey I know you are friends but this is our team @TonyGrossi @Browns @MaryKayCabot @jimdorey

9717 2018-12-31 04:40:53 Dude its true though. Coconut oil is a Godsend and coke will clear anything in your gut, its the acidity in it.
9718 2018-12-31 04:40:52 If only big oil - which, for example, spreads lies about hoaxes around man made global warming - was scrutinized like facebook is, Facebook will be forced to address the problems it creates. Not so with big oil.
9719 2018-12-31 04:40:45 and which 100 companies? I’m sure at least 10 of those companies are oil extraction companies. And 10 more are likely automobile manufacturers and another 10 are probably agro based. That’s basically blaming ourselves. Those companies won’t exist if we weren’t assholes.

9721 2018-12-31 04:40:16 Due to the hole in my gut the ol' black oil keeps trying to eat, it has to have milk (though considering I had a CSM once ban me from making it due to drip coffee not supposed to be in espresso strength, that's probably my fault). That said, unless it's decaf, coffee is coffee.

9730 2018-12-31 04:39:21 Google how Jerry Jones (Dallas Cowboys) made his fortune by drilling his oil wells at an angle to tap off of deposits without having to own the land directly above it.  Clever millionaires will figure out how to take advantage of other millionaires.
9731 2018-12-31 04:38:57 I got a carb cap for my oil rig. It’s shaped like a little blue mushroom with white spots. It’s name is Badger

9741 2018-12-31 04:37:41 Use the revenue from the production, transportation and usage of oil and gas to build out renewables. Put in a fund to super subsidize electric vehicle purchases. The present carbon tax does nothing to build out renewables. Stupid to not use this resource. Can =1.6% of GG!!!
9742 2018-12-31 04:37:31 Butter's nice.. Or melt some Cheez Whiz.. Bacon, olive oil, nutmeg.. :)
9743 2018-12-31 04:37:10 I’ve been washing daily for about a month and a week. Production IS up but my hair hates the washing still. I’m trying to get actually good hair back by March. May would be 1 year since problems started. 
Oil production just isn’t enough yet nor is hair thick enough. Waiting game

9753 2018-12-31 04:36:16 you can’t recycle pizza boxes that have oil and grease stains on it. it will at best damage machines and at worst, contaminate the pulp batch that the paper is turned into. separate the unsoiled cardboard for recycling or throw the box away.
9754 2018-12-31 04:36:08 Pakistan has been seeking oil supplies on credit from a number of countries like Saudia, UAE, Azerbaijan. In the past, Saudi provided us this facility in 1998 which was then converted to grant. Soon these countries will put up placard 'udhaar mang k sharminda na karain'

9755 2018-12-31 04:36:05 Sometimes it seems I am not for Nigeria’s unity, but in truth I am not enthused by a shallow unity that is based on the desire to have access to oil rents.

It worries me that this is not sustainable and is not in the interest of the masses who live here.
9756 2018-12-31 04:35:58 So the environmentalist that are pushing for alternative energy sources are paying Saudi Arabia for oil? Interesting.
When did this start?
Oh it must’ve been in 1930 when US company SoCal struck oil in Bahrain?
We all remember the surge of environmentalists in the 30s.

9763 2018-12-31 04:34:59 You can use cannabis oil which has THC or CBD. The point is the device was created to dispense addictive nicotine and it marketed to kids.
9764 2018-12-31 04:34:56 Old leadership was working with Soros and other NWOs. Remember Hussein giving 1B. to Brazilian oil company that Soros was involved with? Happened same time as they ceased exploration in Gulf of Mexico.

9767 2018-12-31 04:34:34 You know 20 years ago there was similar opinion against refineries. Couldn't get one built anywhere. Now even ND P says why aren't we refining more in Canada. We need to build pipe and export as much oil as we can and earmark a portion from production, transportation and usage.
9768 2018-12-31 04:34:33 I don't. IMO everything he has done from giving billions away to other countries, handcuffing the oil industry losing billions in Revenue & Investments then buying a pipeline, opening Our borders, Un compact is planned not just foolishness ECT. 1/2

9771 2018-12-31 04:33:55 Canadians don't seem to want our oil, these tree hugging hippies would rather buy overpriced overseas oil, any idea how much fuel those tankers burn?
9772 2018-12-31 04:33:54 I just posted my routine today . Unfortunately black soap was too harsh for me . But for the spots I’d say use the oil you see me use in my video . I also use a mask from Lush that has tumeric in it which works for spots as well
9773 2018-12-31 04:33:45 Yes, hemp was a major crop in them days, used to make many things like rope,  paper and fabric for example. The seeds produced a great light cooking oil, just like today.
9774 2018-12-31 04:33:45 “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” Psalm 23:5-6

9785 2018-12-31 04:32:36 It's a fallacy that you can't have both. Of course, life is more important, but humans develop love and respect for rivers, forests, nature. It is not quite the same as oil or potatoes. (1/2)

9787 2018-12-31 04:32:27 I’ve been back and forth between Aussie and a Suave Clarifying shampoo lately. The idea is to dry it out (as much as I hate doing it) so the scalp goes “Hey, the hair is dry! I need to produce more oil!”

9791 2018-12-31 04:31:37 China is already abandoning its stated goals, which were just posturing.

Oil consumption in the USA is down *slightly* because of improved car efficiency as older cars are retired, but there are diminishing returns to that.
9792 2018-12-31 04:31:22 it won't take effect yet because oil firms have old inventory. that needs to be depleted before the higher excise tax kicks in.
9793 2018-12-31 04:31:13 Give it some time and rub on that coconut oil!! In the mean time, both tea tree oil and bergamot oil work wonders for clearing acne, a little bit goes a long way!

9798 2018-12-31 04:30:52 Anyone who has lost someone in battle desperately wants that to mean more than enriching corporate CEOs as we war over money, oil, and different philosophies of sovereign states. Life is not a cartoon where foes must always be vanquished. We just can’t seem to find another way.
9799 2018-12-31 04:30:36 So you do. By the way I read about  新疆 in Wikipedia. According to the sentences in it, you are developing oil industry. Haven't you broken rock mass and got crude oil? If so, maybe methane gas seems to spurt out from ground cracks and water disappeared after that.
9800 2018-12-31 04:30:35 Call it what you will but education has been turned on its head thanks to edu-gurus and their reinvention of pedagogy. Worse, the snake oil being peddled fails to live up to any scientific standards or scrutiny.
9801 2018-12-31 04:30:28 No, it won't.  It has to do with the energy gain in the system.  Solar and wind power are intrinsically low energy gain systems.  Better the biofuels (which should be banned as food is not fuel), but far worse than oil, and much much worse than nuclear.
9802 2018-12-31 04:30:28 I’m pretty sure we all know about how coconut oil can clog your pores, but my skin does very good with it, it smooths, softens and leaves my skin glowing 

I don’t use it everyday though, and I use different EOs with it when I do

9815 2018-12-31 04:28:35 #In2019 I hope people in the woo-world of snake oil cures and other such things stop using the word “quantum” to make things sound awesome. 

Look it up. You’re doin’ it wrong. “QUANTUM” means something very different from what you think. Also, coconut oil will not cure cancer.
9816 2018-12-31 04:28:12 Btw, in the absence of parchment paper (I will admit that I didn't perform much of a search), I brushed olive oil on the pan and dusted it with almond flour. This works.

9819 2018-12-31 04:27:56 Thanks for this. My mistake was both cooking from frozen and then not adding cheese or anything other than butter. I didn't have vegan cheese or sauces at the time. Question: did you use oil or butter on the griddle?

9826 2018-12-31 04:27:10 We could build a solar grid to provide electric to the plasma arcs in the mills and when the job is done we just hook the solar grid up to the national grid.  Use the steel mills to provide pipeline for the oil and gas grid.

9833 2018-12-31 04:24:55 I was supposed to get my oil changed in March. It’s January tomorrow 
9834 2018-12-31 04:24:50 I'm going to continue to point out every phony progressive that starts promoting #M4A, while taking money from Insurance and Pharma. Every new-found financial regulator getting paid by Wall St. Every neuvo-treehugger taking oil cash. What's left, likely, will be Bernie.
9835 2018-12-31 04:24:50 นี่ยังยอมรับคำว่าแซ็วไม่ได้เลย ยังใช้แซวอยู่
9836 2018-12-31 04:24:40 Precisely! What’s reducing the price is the oil dropping.
9837 2018-12-31 04:24:30 the oil spill?

9839 2018-12-31 04:24:06 Mix in two teaspoons of olive oil and set timer for 3 minutes.
9840 2018-12-31 04:24:01 She should have curled her fucking toes when throwing that kick.
9841 2018-12-31 04:23:58 I love that he says it’s not up to the @liberal_party to build a pipeline but yet @JustinTrudeau went out and bought #TMX    Do do what exactly with it JT?  To use it is your private play tunnel?  Why don’t you just admit you’re anti oil.
9842 2018-12-31 04:23:52 If your mustache don’t smell like engine oil why are you even here.
9843 2018-12-31 04:23:48 The @Titans don't want to go to the #NFLPlayoffs - good luck to @CaptAndrewLuck and his @Colts - extra rations of squirrel oil for the men...

9849 2018-12-31 04:23:08 Or CBD OIL. Select brand had a lavendar one with zero thc. Works wonders. Non psychoactive and you can order online. Hope it helps sis xx
9850 2018-12-31 04:23:04 Yes on Bancor.  No on anchoring CB’s, but rather resetting oil value v neutral settlement asset and giving CB’s choice how to manage their own economies based on their needs.  IE have BIS say “gold = 400bbls of oil” & let CB’s figure out what they want to do for their countries.
9851 2018-12-31 04:22:58 Rabies? Coconut oil!

9856 2018-12-31 04:22:35 Best place to get my oil changed?
9857 2018-12-31 04:22:32 No you won because people bought your snake oil salesman act.
9858 2018-12-31 04:22:31 I’m still tryna find stuff to defeat the oil spill over here so i understand
9859 2018-12-31 04:22:25 It can be harmful to your engine to not warm up your car.  At sub-zero temps it takes longer for oil to reach the top of your engine.  Letting your vehicle warm up before driving it is a good thing.
9860 2018-12-31 04:22:23 Bakit walang CHICKEN OIL SA MANG INASAL 
9861 2018-12-31 04:22:11 For those that use cannabis to fight the insidious disease of cancer, would be helpful to research which is actually more destructive to cancers in the body?  decarbed FECO, undecarbed raw FECO, cannabis paste, olive oil infused cannabis, etc? oral, rectal, sublingual?
9862 2018-12-31 04:22:10 But I'm coerced into a Zionist/Jewish currency system that feeds oil and plastic production instead of finding logical, long term solutions. If you ruin Eden, good will have to come back then...... LOL

9866 2018-12-31 04:21:06 So Erdogen by allowing ISIS soldiers to freely cross the Turkish border as well as export oil out of Syria is actually aiding Mohammed Bin Salman, under the pretense of targeting the Kurds? Could the two have been together in the Khashoggi murder?
9867 2018-12-31 04:21:00 Vitamin E oil seems to help me
9868 2018-12-31 04:20:58 Agreed. Now they're too large, operate w/o restraint and answer to no one. No one wants radioactive waste in their local river, but we want to dig a pond in our own yard with local approval, use oil paint, and we don't want to be fined for rainwater that runs off our house's roof
9869 2018-12-31 04:20:40 Hypocrites- against something they use-on your lap top/phone, sitting in a warm home? Drive a vehicle? Buy products from stores that contain oil byproducts& been delivered, for your convenience, by trucks using—- yup—oil and gas. Yet you are protesting against it  ok then
9870 2018-12-31 04:20:39 Because our dependence on oil imports and their propping up of our petroleum-dollar as the world reserve currency enables them to carry out their wicked schemes with impunity. We are at least tangentially responsible for enabling this situation. 
9871 2018-12-31 04:20:37 THANK YOU! & I use tea tree oil, face masks every once in a while, I also used Neutrogena Stubborn Acne and Apricot Exfoliating scrub  Drinking lots of water helps too
9872 2018-12-31 04:20:30 Environmentally friendly oil? You know you’re not supposed to sniff oil, right?

So, you can get an incredible consistency with a mornay of chèvre and ricotta, and then add vinegar, mustard, and Worcestershire to turn it into what cheese whiz dreams of.

9878 2018-12-31 04:20:00 It's a little dangerous, it's mostly chili oil.

"Start with a little bit. Don't douse your dinner in it before you know your tolerance. It's basically pure chili oil."
9879 2018-12-31 04:19:47 There’s no question that those high dollar contributions were mostly not really individual. Oil service industry execs are expected to donate. It’s not a secret. I know first hand, but if you tell people they think you’re a conspiracy theorist.

9883 2018-12-31 04:19:33 Hopefully, 2019 is the year the weed stocks climb like crazy (from all the many subsidiaries acquired for increasing production volume). Im hoping some company’s do some share buybacks, and hoping China’s oil market rebounds somewhat close to forecasts. #CBWTF , #RCON.

9888 2018-12-31 04:19:01 Harper was working on Northern Gateway and Justin killed that and added an oil tanker ban on the west coast. Harper was moving along with Energy East and Justin killed that because it upset some elites in Quebec.  TMX is going to be in courts for years to come and probably won’t
9889 2018-12-31 04:18:29 Decrease of what? Technology development advances in oil and gas related products despite fear we are dying because we are using oil and gas.
9890 2018-12-31 04:17:52 Are you filled up with oil? Are you shinning your light for God? STOP HITTING SNOOZE! All it takes is for you to cry out to him. God's love is like no other!
9891 2018-12-31 04:17:47 Having said that... if the fries are actually good, they require no saucy condiments. Only a bit of salt/pepper to taste or some other sprinkleable flavor enhancer added *as the hot fries are removed from the oil*, such as chives, curry powder, or surprisingly good, cinnamon ^_^
9892 2018-12-31 04:17:47 I just watched a man put beard oil on @djkhaled beard. Not sure how to feel about those #vibes
9893 2018-12-31 04:17:45 Yusuf PBUH [interpreting the dream] said, "Then thereafter will come a year in which people will have abundant rain and in which they will press (wine & oil)."

9898 2018-12-31 04:16:55 Study what actually happens to oil spilled.Any farmer will tell you that when oil spills on farmland the next year the grass is greener and heavier in that spot. There are millions of micro organisms the break it down
9899 2018-12-31 04:16:54 Those are all individual donors. Considering it’s Texas, any candidate from Texas will get hundreds of thousands of dollars from oil & gas.
9900 2018-12-31 04:16:27 Yea. But I learned the hard way NOT to do it without an oil. Or you can do it in the shower.
9901 2018-12-31 04:16:24 Lots of factors but I'm blaming it on drop in oil price. Canada exports a lot of oil to the US. Could be a factor.
9902 2018-12-31 04:16:20 KING OF OIL !!!
9903 2018-12-31 04:16:15 It is exactly how it works. The price is an aggregate of all the components such as road tax, oil cost, HST, previously CT, etc. I simplified it for you but seems that’s still too hard. I know it’s fun to pick on Ford, but this time he is right and you are dead wrong. Good night
9904 2018-12-31 04:16:12 Yes, boiling oil fail confirmed. St. John got tossed into a vat of boiling oil and was unharmed. 

That’s why that marooned him on Patmos, to get rid of him that way.
9905 2018-12-31 04:16:12 Someone is getting paid to come up with this stuff?? 

Canada doesn’t need a babysitter we need a leader. 

Pretty sure oil workers in Alberta could care less what movie Justin Trudeau would recommend to watch. 

Let’s fix the economy please...
9906 2018-12-31 04:16:11 Hooooolllllyyyyy fuuuuuckkkk my brain just exploded. I’m gonna send this to my old fuck buddy who works in oil fields and tell him that this is the future I want with him
9907 2018-12-31 04:16:01 They have any oil?
9908 2018-12-31 04:16:00 That’s your reference ken ham, I almost wet myself laughing. You follow that snake oil salesman, charlatin, Carney act..wow you really follow the high credentialed scholars..
9909 2018-12-31 04:15:53 I don’t know if you can order from @CannTrust without a medical marijuana card. But they have CBD oil and marijuana that is high in CBD and very low thc. I don’t like the thc. As for ordering from the States, I’ve been told it’s ok if there is no thc

9926 2018-12-31 04:13:58 I’ll have to try that again! I just wish I could turn it into an easy applicator like these lash products lol. I tried castor oil once before using a lash brush and got oil everyyyyywhere 
9927 2018-12-31 04:13:46 Rick, don’t perpetuate this lie. The gas price drop is due to the reduction in  oil prices. How are you going to explain the inevitable increase in gas prices? Blame it on Wynne? Just because the Premier is a idiot doesn’t mean you have to be. We didn’t elect you to be a toady.
9928 2018-12-31 04:13:33 Hi Kenneth Procto, I know you define "Democrat" by how much money they give to war profiteers, big oil, big pharma and big ag, but if that's what it keeps standing for, it will stand alone and you'll have GOP presidents until the world ends.

9934 2018-12-31 04:12:58 $70 oil is not enough to incentivize new production globally, outside a few very select few basins. Just saying
9935 2018-12-31 04:12:56 I welcome them to come to Venezuela, plenty of children die by the hour because of the government and hunger. Oh well but there's still some oil money to hand around.
9936 2018-12-31 04:12:52 I used to suffer from this constantly until someone told me to grease the inside of the pan with vegetable oil/crisco and dust with flour. Bang out any excess and anything should slide right out!

9939 2018-12-31 04:12:32 Oil companies invest in tech. So do auto companies. That's why we have an 80% emissions reduction since the 1950s.

9941 2018-12-31 04:12:07 I think I’m missing the “relaxing” point of an essential oil diffuser because the scent is so strong that I’m convinced I’m poisoning myself. Don’t worry though I googled it and that is NOT the case. #firstworldproblems

9947 2018-12-31 04:11:29 This is like tobacco workers rallying for cigarettes when the industry faced regulations and changes because it became known they cause cancer. I understand people don't want to lose jobs.  Someone needs to help them understand the industry is changing.  Oil will never BOOM again
9948 2018-12-31 04:11:16 It wasn’t 50,000 Calgarians. Thousands of AB &BC citizens fly from that airport as well & about a 1/4 of those 50,000 are people flying home to families in the Atlantic. Never ceases to amaze me. They all work in oil & gas   in another province and still vote Liberal. #Hypocrits
