1 2018-09-03 23:59:27 Sweet! I’m sure they will go out of business because of it. You know what happens next right? Those of us that support Colin will invest in Nike like never before. Nike stocks will actually go up because of the left supporting Nike with our money.

41 2018-09-03 23:47:09 That was not the clearest description of the strategy, selling loss stocks. Remember there are wash sale rules
42 2018-09-03 23:46:34 Yes you are. You assumed that the stocks were going up based on a trend that was being reversed immediately before the graph ended. You are rejecting the newest data in favor of old data that would’ve proven your point if we didn’t have the recent drop or if we had more data that

71 2018-09-03 23:29:06 So if white people are boycotting Nike does this means y'all are giving up stocks and NFL tickets? Asking so my people can finally benefit from our interests and the REAL fans can go to the games

89 2018-09-03 23:12:09 She has only herself to blame and given that she's previously accused a fellow actor from another panto of punching her I'd very much doubt she'll top many lists in entertainment. Unless of course someone brings back the stocks or public flogging that could be entertaining
90 2018-09-03 23:12:01 Curious to see how Wall Street responds. Stocks don’t usually respond well to controversy. At least until the next controversy
91 2018-09-03 23:10:05 I started in 1990's with the stock market, have take my wins & losses. I know a few people like myself with respect to stocks. Massive being relative. In today's economy, there is many with full time jobs from part, better opportunities available, and competitive wages rising.
92 2018-09-03 23:09:49 I'll weigh in Omar. I like to speculate in stocks. I have 3 longs and 2 shorts. My portfolio is posted. I'm a patient holder and I'm in it for large gains. Multiples on the long side. High %s on short side. $tsla is a classic short sale 4 me, liquidity & governance challenges.
93 2018-09-03 23:08:29 I hope their stocks takes a knee....All the way down.
94 2018-09-03 23:08:06 Adidas stocks are gonna soar
95 2018-09-03 23:08:05 The real laugh for me, was hearing that Nike stocks fell on people hearing the news about Nike and Kaepernick.  Too funny!  
96 2018-09-03 23:06:26 Personaly, Hulu is way better than $NFLX. Dump the stocks.
97 2018-09-03 23:05:00 Yeah, this campaign wasn't well thought out. I hear their stocks are already taking a crap.
98 2018-09-03 23:04:21 Sorry dude both stocks fell on news
99 2018-09-03 23:03:32 Omg .. who was the CEO genius who made that decision, stocks bailing , lost sales , guess will do good in China and Russian now , not in U.S.
100 2018-09-03 23:03:00 Aquanet stocks  jumped two points that day.

107 2018-09-03 22:58:37 I'm old enough to remember when @themotleyfool was respected for showing people how to avoid exactly this type of "hot tip" marketing and how to spot misuse of statistics (he picked 5 top stocks... out of how many total picks over the years?) Do better.
108 2018-09-03 22:58:09 Agreed, that is why I referred to mistakes in the market vs. individual stocks.  I have plenty of horrible sell decisions in those.
109 2018-09-03 22:58:03 Listen over and over again. MGK went in hard. The bullets sprayed hit many. Not just em and kim. Listen well. A reply will boost MKG's stocks up. He has always been a hardcore rapper. Sentiments aside. He bodied eminem in a way Drake and co can do. Only Cassidy can
110 2018-09-03 22:56:14 Not everything is gone.  New currency will need to be created.  It will have to be valued by gold or some some other tangable.  The holders of notes will be gone, if everything of value is decimated, homes, stocks, etc, bur we maintain debt, how do recover?
111 2018-09-03 22:55:38 tomorrow buying stocks in Adidas!

112 2018-09-03 22:54:29 Since this is a 24 hour poll, I’ll wait until I see what the stocks do and then vote. :)
113 2018-09-03 22:54:18 I'll be voting him. So far, the economy has been amazing under him. I've seen multiple pay increases. 

My stocks have soared (which means my 401k is very nice now).

I'm much better off under Trump than the past presidents.
114 2018-09-03 22:53:06 I’m kind of mad I sold my stocks in Nike. I KNEW I was going to regret this
115 2018-09-03 22:52:42 buying stocks in Adidas tomorrow!!
116 2018-09-03 22:52:36 Others will buy their stocks...RT @michnels00: @ColinCowherd @Nike @Kaepernick7 Colin - you are not thinking of the fund managers who now have to RUN from this stock and it has nothing to do with politics.
117 2018-09-03 22:51:48 $oro$ just dumped loads of cash on major social media stocks.

126 2018-09-03 22:46:14 Lol.. not calling for a 2000 point drop. I think you misinterpreted my post. I was talking about index prices & underlying breadth dynamics

Many stocks made their low in Nov 2008 & a higher low in Mar 2009. Similarly, many stocks/indices made their high in January w/ no new ATH

134 2018-09-03 22:39:59 Yes, hotels did up security and are revising their security to be more effective, at least thats what ABC news reported back in January. And several states, such as New Jersey and connecticut, did ban bump stocks, regardless of what happened federally.
135 2018-09-03 22:38:51 Canadian Weed stocks are going to be very profitable if you buy in right now. My favourite, Aphria Inc. shot up from $10.50 a share last week, when I found it, to nearly $17 a share today and I’m still kicking myself for not pulling the trigger and buying in. (1/3)

137 2018-09-03 22:37:28 It's funny, whenever a company (or restaurant) sides with the left and their disdain for America, they see that real Americans don't play that game and their stocks plummet. Bye bye Nike.
138 2018-09-03 22:36:41 kulang na kulang pa stocks ko ng colored paper sa bag. need moreeee!!!
139 2018-09-03 22:35:22 Bye Nike. Thank goodness I sold their stocks while they were up
140 2018-09-03 22:33:05 LoL Obviously Insane. Sell your stocks. MAGA
141 2018-09-03 22:32:54 Short sellers piss me off! Fuck nut Andrew Left totally shits on stocks he can’t cover the shorts! He manipulates the media talking madness so the market tanks the stock! Then he covers his shorts. These people need to GTFO!
142 2018-09-03 22:32:35 Parianas @_machiparu_ Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
143 2018-09-03 22:31:17 See when ppl invest in bitcoin they want growth at the opportunity cost of other investments such as stocks & bonds.
144 2018-09-03 22:31:03 Also, everything is insanely expensive in Aus. My buddy that moved there stocks up on things like shaving cream when he visits Canada, because it's so much cheaper.
145 2018-09-03 22:30:19 You have enough to spends on stocks tobe making "massive money" from it and got any "$80/week" raise. I highly doubt you are middle class.
146 2018-09-03 22:29:53 Marami akong stocks
147 2018-09-03 22:29:18 Stocks are probably nuts right now
148 2018-09-03 22:27:18 Well, what can you say...
Nike's headquarters is located on the outskirts of Portland, OR. Not much "diversity of thought" going around in this area. 
Let me know when Nike stocks are on "blue light special".
149 2018-09-03 22:27:01 Since they are a publicly traded company, you can indeed see if their stocks go up, down or stay the same. That is the primary indicator of a successful company. Clearly you have no stocks or a 401(k) or any kind of money invested.
150 2018-09-03 22:26:34 Why wouldn’t he? We’ve had a bull market since March 2009. What would buying stocks have to do with supporting Hillary?
151 2018-09-03 22:26:11 The stock market is still good. As long as you invest in good dividend paying stocks you will be able to retire. Just reinvest the dividends.
152 2018-09-03 22:25:12 Politicians were way more honest before Trump and I use my feelings to tell who is a nincompoop and who is just acting like one...Because we forgive puppets as long as they hate Trumpand stocks don’t go up and down by the day. It takes exactly 9 years for economic recovery 
153 2018-09-03 22:25:03 Sell your Nike stocks now !!
154 2018-09-03 22:24:44 I hope everyone boycotts @nike so I can snatch up all them stocks when the price drop
155 2018-09-03 22:24:37 If this is not fake news, sell your bike stocks.
156 2018-09-03 22:24:32 @nike your stocks with the black delegation will not fall. They will exceed more than likely
157 2018-09-03 22:23:03 Si il y a des ruptures de stocks sur les fournitures dans tous les magasins c’est que Z est passée par là 
158 2018-09-03 22:22:15 He only wants you to join stocks advisors. Doesn’t give you the name of the stock until you do! Rip off!
159 2018-09-03 22:20:37 There goes #Nike stocks. 
160 2018-09-03 22:20:10 I wonder if I can afford Nike stocks?
161 2018-09-03 22:19:54 Don't play the penny stocks.
162 2018-09-03 22:19:19 read the intelligent investor by benjamin graham. also rich dad poor dad by robert kiyosaki is about gaining wealth through assets so investing in general not just stocks
163 2018-09-03 22:19:02 While I understand what you mean, bump stocks were not banned. There was a series of state and federal bills proposed but they all failed to get enough votes. Trump almost signed an executive order but then he met with the NRA and suddenly he changed his mind. 1/2
164 2018-09-03 22:19:01 I think I read on a blog somewhere that UBS has a big short position on Tesla. If this is true - this is another sad example of how powerful Wall Street players use their influence and their good name to manipulate stocks in their interest.

166 2018-09-03 22:17:52 I foresee Nike stocks bombing tomorrow.
167 2018-09-03 22:17:09 Whew, I don’t own Nike apparel or shoes bc if I did it would be on eBay or yardsaler sites ASAP! I will have to dbl check w/hubby to see if we have stocks we need to sell! #BoycottNike
168 2018-09-03 22:15:58 Uh Reponer stocks ya!
169 2018-09-03 22:15:46 Shid im willing to learn cause stocks where the money at apparently
170 2018-09-03 22:14:06 401k and stocks are making massive money. I'm in the middle class, as well. Lying Dems want to increase taxes. 
They want to pull money out of business and the people and make them reliant on the Gov. They spread fear and identity politics to divide us. 
It is disgusting!!
171 2018-09-03 22:13:06 More like stocks went up
172 2018-09-03 22:11:54 Buy unpopular stocks,hold & watch them like a hawk
173 2018-09-03 22:10:40 It's obvious they don't give a damn about your stocks , nor Trump's..
174 2018-09-03 22:10:32 disgusting @Nike can’t wait to watch your stocks fall this week
175 2018-09-03 22:08:22 So apparently my dad has a shit ton of money invested in the stocks of a marijuana dispensery chain but me having like 3gs in my room is CROSSING THE LINE
176 2018-09-03 22:07:45 I suppose @Nike will care when their stocks begin to plummet
177 2018-09-03 22:06:57 Other considerations, we cannot short #Bayry although up to their gills in Monsanto Round Up Suits. Round Up is the next Asbestos for certain.  I do feel bad for Bayer.  Not all weed stocks are made alike - #TLRY and #CRON only ones in my portfolio.
178 2018-09-03 22:05:58 Stocks plummet faster than the NFL ratings did. I wonder how Mr. social justice warrior feels about Nike paying overseas workers $3.00 an hour
179 2018-09-03 22:05:50 @jeffbrownwbz interesting to see how Nike stocks opens 
180 2018-09-03 22:05:49 What a  show!! Sell your stocks!! @Nike just committed business suicide!

182 2018-09-03 22:04:17 It was weird cause I had an iPod touch and i remember seeing all the stocks drop a ton in late 2008 but I had no idea what it meant to me
183 2018-09-03 22:03:24 To all my niggas: NIKE....let’s get this paper up and go buy these NIKE stocks
184 2018-09-03 22:02:40 Sell your Nike stocks!
185 2018-09-03 22:01:25 Can’t shill stocks legally :( they’re not hard to find
186 2018-09-03 21:59:50 I’ll put all of my stocks into your shares
187 2018-09-03 21:59:09 But you’re a Chinese spy.
188 2018-09-03 21:59:02 Merci, j'avais pourtant (mal) cherché  C'est une bonne news car mes 780 sont plus longues. En revanche, y a pas tellement de fuites concernant ces cartes...  Même les revendeurs n'ont pas l'air sûrs des dates de réception de leurs stocks... ça m'inquiète un peu...
189 2018-09-03 21:58:47 My point was it should matter whether an #etf is classified as #smartbeta or a factor #etf. The stocks inside drive performance not the classification.
190 2018-09-03 21:58:41 I get your point : I can respect it. Will see how this turns out. It is not all about money, but what I think doesn't matter.  I own no Nike stocks or shoes .might have a couple of shirts with the logo , not going to burn them of the flag in protest.  LOL
191 2018-09-03 21:57:58 Looks like Nike stocks are going down
192 2018-09-03 21:57:39 Update (Sept 3rd):
 The Street Stock race that was in progress and the Mini Stock race that was lined up will now be continued at the 3 PM start time on Saturday Sept 8th according to the line-ups and scoring before the power outage with points for "King of The Stocks" being used
193 2018-09-03 21:56:50 Wow,, I would of thought Nike would of known better. Their stocks will drop now, just who do they think buys their shoes. Didn’t they learn anything from the boycott of NFL games. 
194 2018-09-03 21:56:23 The next get rich quick scheme is VR tech. Invest in any company in RND process. Some companies are still trading at penny stocks and are suppling $APPL. Our company has recently invested 10s of millions and many have done the same. #newbubble #VR #technology
195 2018-09-03 21:56:06 Encontré una página por la cual uno puede descargar las stocks oficiales de Oreo para el Moto G5s Plus y instalarlas con el adb fastboot
196 2018-09-03 21:55:59 There goes Nike support! I hope they tank to the bottom now since they're making Kaepernick the face..
Let their stocks drop...
197 2018-09-03 21:55:45 Lmao sum yall really think a few thousand people who stop buying @Nike is really gonna effect they're sales/stocks?  
U realize how many sport teams they sponsor? How many athletes they have under contract?  Go ahead AND START WEARING ADIDAS! BYE! #scrubs
198 2018-09-03 21:53:35 I mean their stocks have gone up but that’s none of my business
199 2018-09-03 21:53:09 Wages are flat and inflation is up. Most of America does not even make a livable wage nor do they own significant investments. 1/3 of stocks are owned by foreign investors. Farmers need a bail out. What planet are those fools in the White House from?
200 2018-09-03 21:53:02 Bill that's cuz it caused asset inflation vs CPI inflation. Look at real estate, art, stocks, venture capital

Eg Even when fed rates were zero, the average person's credit card APR was still basically the same 15-25%

The biggest beneficiaries were rich people, owners of capital
201 2018-09-03 21:52:38 Yeah I got account put $200 down and bought random ass stocks lmao all them things in the negative
202 2018-09-03 21:52:13 Watch how fast @Nike stocks fall.
203 2018-09-03 21:51:45 The voice in me says sell those stocks! @Nike is about to be the Titanic   business suicide 
204 2018-09-03 21:51:43 But how many other stocks did he recommend from 2007-2012 that haven’t panned out?
205 2018-09-03 21:51:42 Okay, back to just stocks. Just had to get this media B.S. out of my system.
206 2018-09-03 21:51:38 Nike stocks will drop faster than Kaepernick taking a knee.
207 2018-09-03 21:49:57 Just think, every time you close out a losing trade, there are countless other traders all around the world, many of them successful, doing the same thing at that very moment. #wateroffaducksback #stocks
208 2018-09-03 21:49:38 Instead of going out this weekend I'ma buy me some Nike stocks.
209 2018-09-03 21:47:43 My 401(k) and stocks have done incredibly since about 2009
210 2018-09-03 21:47:23 @NewBalance BUY
@Reebok BUY
@Nike SELL
#NotWithKap Colin Kaepernick aka 'Commie Kap'
#TakeAKnee - #BreakYourLeg
#JustDoIt - SELL NIKE STOCKS!
211 2018-09-03 21:47:16 Sell your stocks now. Stop purchasing their products now. It wont get better from here, it never does with liberal democrats. They destroy everything they touch.
212 2018-09-03 21:47:10 That's being equally fair to her and Ryan. As in both parties.

Bringing her out on tv is like putting someone in the stocks.

There's some serious issues there that tv isn't going to help.
213 2018-09-03 21:46:06 Their stocks went up 18%
214 2018-09-03 21:46:04 I feel bad for under armor, adidas, Reebok, etc...their stocks will tank when he comes out and tells everyone to go that way.
215 2018-09-03 21:45:42 Yea get on that just dont go too hard like I did with 10 percent. I let my investor pick the stock for me since i dont know much about stocks
216 2018-09-03 21:45:06 Jerome Powell's net worth exceeds $100 million.

He doesn't need speaking fees that Bernanke and Yellen receive right now.

Rates are going up, stocks and oil are to collapse, and Jerome Powell doesn't really care.
217 2018-09-03 21:44:48 I should have bought stocks in New Balance, this #BOYCOTTNIKE is sure going to drop their stock prices. 
218 2018-09-03 21:43:57 I know that's true in theory, but what's the mechanics of that? Is it dependent on lots of foreign money owning your bonds / stocks?

What if there is very little foreign money owning your bonds, thus difference in interest rate leads to less selloff?

I have no clue, just asking
219 2018-09-03 21:42:51 If I see a commercial for Nike and they have racist Kaepernick kneeling to our flag I will sell my stocks and never purchase another Nike product for me or my family from that company ever again!
220 2018-09-03 21:42:43 Note to self:
Sell any and all @Nike stocks 1st thing Tuesday morning. Wall street prediction: stocks to drop 20% by mid day?
221 2018-09-03 21:42:39 just squeezed one out now im looking at stocks. not falling for any traps till i have 1M
222 2018-09-03 21:42:05 Yes I see that, Amyloid hypothesis again... As usually for AT stocks, very early stage. There are already other approaches targeting toxic oligomers btw. Seeing the word "vaccine" along with AD, ouch...
223 2018-09-03 21:41:33 Good time to sell Facebook stocks #trading #Facebookdown
224 2018-09-03 21:41:07 It's done using relative percentage of stocks with bullish (0-100) state of trend, volume and momentum indicators.
225 2018-09-03 21:41:01 Beğendiğiniz projeleri bir kenara ayırıp takip edebilirsiniz tüm marketi incelemenize gerek yok fırsatlar bitmez 
226 2018-09-03 21:39:56 What's sick is our president is sociopath.DOJ is sapose to do the right thing. We know you have commited white collar crimes your entire life u will awnser for that. It's ok hunter used 250k illegally on his family. Collins helped family not lose $ on stocks crashing ur sad joke.

228 2018-09-03 21:39:42 #AVZ transport study due out shortly, it will provide a great insight into the options available for the monster 2 market! All lithium stocks have retraced in 2018, and all will swing higher when the cycle turns north again #Lithium
229 2018-09-03 21:38:11 Müthiş anlatım teşekkürler. Peki bunu formulize etmenin bir yolu var mı? Yoksa grafikleri tek tek mi incelemek gerekli
230 2018-09-03 21:37:07 Saving up my cash and stocks for when the economy crashes so I can actually afford real estate here. :^)
231 2018-09-03 21:36:53 We all what that means...short selling my Nike stocks tomorrow morning. Did nike give him Stock options? Lol #NikeCrashandBurn
232 2018-09-03 21:35:04 And............Nike stocks tank!  Why do corporations get involved in politics 
233 2018-09-03 21:34:04 Just bought 5 shares of @Nike stocks
234 2018-09-03 21:33:00 Soros buys millions in Facebook, Twitter stocks after bashing tech companies.
235 2018-09-03 21:32:47 Doubtful.. nothing happens to these stocks because of issues like that, only if the infrastructure of the company is compromised
236 2018-09-03 21:30:31 Recommend 20 stocks a year, cite the top 5 performers, ignore the rest, write a subscription investment newsletter marketing it by citing the winners, get blog type websites to promote with some marketing dollars, aaaaaand scene.
237 2018-09-03 21:29:46 What did people want to happen? Put her in  stocks maybe and throw rotten food at her? Strip her naked and parade her through the streets G.O.T style? She's obviously got psychological problems - she believed what she was saying.
238 2018-09-03 21:28:27 Stocks I am interested in atm in terms of buying into the market include #AAPL and other stocks preforming well in this slightly down market.
239 2018-09-03 21:28:09 Time to sell my stocks
240 2018-09-03 21:27:33 Stocks in the square
241 2018-09-03 21:27:28 Combine all this with the upcoming election turmoil, which I figure will last till LS polls unless BJP registers landslide victories in both Rajasthan and MP, it's red times ahead for the market. All major index stocks have already peaked and indexes are overvalued. Views?
242 2018-09-03 21:26:55 Pension plans commonly invest in stocks.
243 2018-09-03 21:26:12 So if the person strictly invest in growth stocks they can build wealth on the low I’m assuming? This is amazing!
244 2018-09-03 21:25:59 Thanks to @Nike the stocks to watch this week are sperry and skechers.
245 2018-09-03 21:24:13 Just watch @Nike stocks plunge 
246 2018-09-03 21:24:01 If you are cool like me you delete the news app but never the stocks app!
247 2018-09-03 21:23:44 Ah oui dans ce cas c'est cool, mais je disais même nombre de stocks/even en l'occurrence. Sinon agree c'est plutôt cool dans ces cas
248 2018-09-03 21:23:39 I got mine on stocks exchange but you can get it on Crypto Hub, nanu exchange or bitebtc.
249 2018-09-03 21:23:13 Stocks for marijuana are going up, now would be a great time to invest if you need extra moooolahhh
250 2018-09-03 21:23:05 You can boycott something, but saying that you're selling your stocks or burning your shoes is just stupid.
251 2018-09-03 21:22:29 Looks like @adidas or @PUMA will see their stocks rise!! After all @Nike did have some extra money after pulling their golf  equipment 
252 2018-09-03 21:22:07 Sell your  stocks in Nike right now .. Suck anyway just get rid of them Nikes going to go right down the tubes now
253 2018-09-03 21:19:52 Leclerc drive de Besac, c’est le seul drive qui te force à faire tes courses ailleurs  Des problèmes de stocks bien trop récurrents... 
Faut que je teste un autre drive plus compétent sur Besançon 
254 2018-09-03 21:19:40 Good to know that as far as Twitter/Channel 5 are concerned, justice should still involve a pillory and stocks. Do we need a tragedy for us to see that our culture of online mob shaming is toxic and reflects horribly on us a society?
255 2018-09-03 21:19:05 Stocks had some fine picks as well. I forgot about coinexchange completely, is it even alive?
256 2018-09-03 21:18:41 Will sell my stocks in Nike tomorrow.
257 2018-09-03 21:18:41 Our money supply will be manipulated even further to support these emotions. Consider investing in sound bearer bond monetary instruments, like gold or Bitcoin. 401ks, stocks, land can be taken away.
258 2018-09-03 21:18:08 The real sacrifice is just beginning. Nike will sacrifice market share across all sports. Tennis, Golf, Baseball, Work out, Basketball. How many youth organizations support local police? Its now the anti law enforcement brand. Real smart. $358 Billion annually. Sell your stocks!
259 2018-09-03 21:17:56 We make our own laws & rules on health,welfare,criminal justice, foreign affairs,tax, housing, education,pensions,foreign aid, defence.
EU has (with our input)common rules on trade(standards), workers, human+consumer rights, fishing (stocks+quotas) farming(subsidies) & that's it!
260 2018-09-03 21:17:34 @wh3rlingdervish aslamu alaikum bro

Plz help..

Stocks trading is jayaz in islam ? 

Some say that its halal because there is actual buying and selling and risk of profit and loss and it is halal if invested in companies which dont deal with haraam like alcohol or banks etc..
261 2018-09-03 21:17:13 @Nike and a big FU to nike for making that back up pathetic anti cop racist kapernick there main man. Pathetic. Nike stocks plummet. Watch!
262 2018-09-03 21:14:37 Yes sir : he will say something like this: Bad for America -they make their apparel/shoes clothing in China and China is bad for America. I don't like items made in China. Tariffs are working on China. Nike needs to learn from this. Sell your stocks, boycott Nike.
263 2018-09-03 21:14:24 Holiday nearly over .. great opportunities this week ..Top stocks .. nvda..see note  aapl ,,,new products intros sept 12...  amzn pause after big rise... bullish... googl under 50 day ma ,but still a possible good looker....  nflx trading noise until goes above last week's high
264 2018-09-03 21:12:45 None of the major chains in Canada have stocks like this. A little jealous up here.

266 2018-09-03 21:12:12 I'm not decrying stock market gains. That's always a good thing, no matter who's #POTUS. Incidentally, POTUS has little to no effect on stocks. But the fact is, stock gains disproportionately benefit the rich by a very wide margin.
267 2018-09-03 21:11:19 Nice to see the weed stocks #ANA #SATI #HASH all get some attention and traction today 

I have to say that out of them all #ANA has to offer the best value from £2 mill mcap and a first class BOD at the helm - I am long and strong

271 2018-09-03 21:06:15 Nike want miss you fool! Nike Stocks will soar, like they need it to soar, it is already good!
272 2018-09-03 21:05:23 2 months ago I broke my back. For the last 6 weeks I have literally been trading/working upside down, inverted screens on swing arms, above my head as I lay flat. It’s been humbling and challenging. Still trading, running a fund/team, and going after it! #Stocks #Investing
273 2018-09-03 21:05:20 Nike: from Michael Jordan to "Kapernick"? Now that's what you call going down the tubes. Low expectations, no Love for the USA, no guts, no talent, nothing anyone wants to see or hear. Can you say " low stocks and low sells. Can you say Spalding & Adidas?
274 2018-09-03 21:04:50 Twitter stocks will surge as both Facebook & instagram are down. Downsides of social media monopolies. #facebookdown #instagramdown

280 2018-09-03 20:58:58 I got @adidasUS stocks; way before I would of even consider Nike; just due to the fact that @kanyewest is making such an impact with yeezys at the moment & his upcoming 2019 basketball shoe’s release. fyi
281 2018-09-03 20:58:25 I'm buying more Nike stocks.

286 2018-09-03 20:54:01 I buy silver coins, silver rounds, and gold bullion. I don't anything about gold stocks, I want to hold it in my hands and put it in my safe.
287 2018-09-03 20:53:47 Parkland was a horrible event, but similar things (and sometimes worse) happened and nothing changed. Obama was president during Sandy Hook. Clinton during Columbine. Bush during vatech. Trump banning bump stocks after Vegas is the only thing that’s changed. Both sides do little
288 2018-09-03 20:52:39 It's sickening. Boris Johnson should be in stocks with people throwing shit at him, but somehow he's in line to be the next PM. Says it all about the UK and the fuckwits who should never have been taught how to draw a cross with a crayon.
289 2018-09-03 20:52:20 It's very alarming to the shareholder who don't want to suffer from the failure to produce a viable product to the consumer. I had stocks in EA, sold them before the delay because they were on a downward trend for a few weeks.
290 2018-09-03 20:52:00 Taxcuts resulted in buy backs stocks and better bonusses ceo’s. Deregulations result in for instance a worse environment. Trump is taking credit for something thats was allready a trend
291 2018-09-03 20:51:11 # wouldn’t you do the same if you love winning ? People working , stocks up , business coming back to America, our military built back up , our Veterans, being taken care of , our tax dollars being use to go to places we approve of , borders Secured , no more room
292 2018-09-03 20:51:10 I'm not sure how you come to that conclusion, but ok. I don't think this was a wise move...stocks should be interesting to watch tomorrow :O
293 2018-09-03 20:51:08 We don’t have the stocks, anymore so, I guess we have #CBB apology interviews instead.

298 2018-09-03 20:45:56 You're right. UA should be cheap since their stocks have fallen.
299 2018-09-03 20:45:22 Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Google were never tech stocks, unless you call JPM, GE and BA tech stocks too
300 2018-09-03 20:45:07 You mean Collins and Hunter, pictured here at the table with Trump, Marsha & Congressman who bought stocks based on tips from Collins? You could call this a quintet of  criminals... Marsha is just as dirty & corrupt as any. She's can't be allowed to advise and consent on judges

303 2018-09-03 20:43:53 Thinking loud: 1. Strategic investment (mining eg) to remain in public domain 2. A certain investment bracket to go Eritrean private investors 3. A higher bracket to be open to international investors (shares, stocks, eg). Any thoughts?
304 2018-09-03 20:43:07 @zerowondering I just took 17 stocks of a dk cpu without dying in 99 stock survival!!! I cant believe I'm improving so much lol just last week I was barely taking 2

318 2018-09-03 20:35:32 So what’s the best way for young investors to start with stocks? DO: regular LT indexing. DONTs: trading, big bets, chasing hot tips, leverage, Option gyms, market timing. DO K match, Roth. DONTs: Uber, bar shots, shoe closets, Sports betting, weekly mani/pedi, junkets, dine out
319 2018-09-03 20:35:14 in other news, Nike stocks are crashing as sales for Adidas have gone through the roof.....
320 2018-09-03 20:34:37 If you have only IB account, you can basically forget about shorting because hot stocks will not be shortable. Even if it does, you might better avoid it because there's a big chance of crowded short. Tradezero no PDT, Vision borrows, nice leverage, so small amount is playable
321 2018-09-03 20:34:22 If you have stocks in #nike I'd pull out now

334 2018-09-03 20:23:06 Beast mode is still technically more profitable than this since even now, you're making 180* profit with beast mode and only 3-4* profit with this, since even looks can't make this 100k since it has 1 of the most stocks of immortal swords. Still a good buy if you got it. RIP me.
335 2018-09-03 20:23:03 I'd settle for a set of stocks and a supply of sharp rocks.
336 2018-09-03 20:22:25 For all the volatility swirling around cannabis stocks, last week's change a very tame $CGC +1.6%, $ACBFF 1.4, $CRON (0.6) => digesting/consolidating big gains. Some that moved less caught up $APHQF +20.5%, $OGRMF 10.8 & $SPRWF 17.6. Not overbought, holding tight right here.
337 2018-09-03 20:22:08 glad to help! just can’t have these stocks that take you for hundreds when you were only looking for a couple bucks.
338 2018-09-03 20:21:28 Please also tell us about the many, many stocks you suggested we buy that turned out to be duds. Anyone can make multiple suggestions and then run around the world shouting about the two that panned out, and how smart they are.
339 2018-09-03 20:19:22 I actually believe that #cryptocurrency is a better investment for black people than are #stocks and even #realestate; that does not mean those are not all still great investments; I always feel like those other two games have been going for too long; Crypto is much newer -
340 2018-09-03 20:18:49 I suspect the lower interest rates put more pressure on companies to do things like share buybacks because the folks who wanted low risk from bonds tried to get lower risk from stocks and put pressure on them to do it.
Short term a buyback is much less risky than a 10 Y new drug

344 2018-09-03 20:16:38 Había muchísimo por mejorar. Lo del déficit es inexacto, Venimos comiéndonos todos nuestros stocks, tenemos problemas de competitividad muy grave desde hace muchos años, no tenemos un rumbo de desarrollo. El Kirchnerismo fue una linda coyuntura para encararlo. No se hizo.
345 2018-09-03 20:15:32 Afraid that is true! All stocks we had have gone to the winners. Keep ear out for the next competition on @absolute_rally though, there’ll be another great prize on offer...for sure

355 2018-09-03 20:08:45 you have to assume an item ruleset will use more stock or more sets, but even at 2 stocks if you were at 0% and expected not to live past 100% the most you could lose is 50% which is super rare.  All of this ignores the point I'm making anyway.
356 2018-09-03 20:08:31 Stocks are not equivalent to life in much consistency
357 2018-09-03 20:07:58 Lots of tweets about $AMD because it’s making a big move, all other stocks chart wise don’t compare. Run is very similar to $NVDA in 2016. Only 2 companies compete in this Multi Billion dollar industry, AI GPU servers.

359 2018-09-03 20:06:41 3 stocks, a bomb can at most take 1/3rd of your life and it cannot literally spawn anywhere anytime.  Disingenuous argument that ignores the point entirely.
360 2018-09-03 20:05:44 Jus bought my first shares of a company. This is the my first time ever trading stocks; and even though i'm pretty confident in this company's current trend, ima still move more conservative. Gotta crawl before you walk, you kno

380 2018-09-03 19:47:28 So the 'dirty' part is of no concern to you, obvs.
 Also I'm pretty sure the Collins investigation started after he called his son to tell him to dump the stocks from the Rose Garden after meeting with Trump. 
So the 'Obama era' is a lie.
381 2018-09-03 19:47:26 DO NOT be a rat on a wheel. Invest $100 into good stocks(read) every week. 4 years you will have a portfolio that provides an income allowing you to live on a beach and be free. To speed it up invest in cryptos, make multiple streams of income, do everything for freedom.
382 2018-09-03 19:45:10 True that! This works ,

385 2018-09-03 19:41:00 They are generally aware though that tech startup funds do not invest in fixed income instruments or dividend paying index constituent stocks. It's in a different allocation bucket from the bucket that's assessed versus treasury yield.
386 2018-09-03 19:39:22 You can turn off the items that do, which was addressed in the ISP Brawl rule set.

392 2018-09-03 19:34:03 Very few stocks fairly valued . It’s either way overvalued or way undervalued . This imbalances helps them reap huge benefits because they love a quick buck . We know guns kills , no one makes them illegal . This behavior won’t change

395 2018-09-03 19:28:33 Inflation only depends on money supply. Here only relative price adjustments will take place as deficit spending is very tight. It's a move to suck excess liquidity that is chasing the overvalued stocks.

397 2018-09-03 19:28:14 Yup lowest for years..reason being is I only want special situation stocks that have the levers for success within their control (ish)..with the wider market thus having hopefully a lesser impact on my returns #theory

Since it might not be something you agree with I thought it’s only right to ask your permission. PS I’m not trying to be sexist, just trying to be funny.
432 2018-09-03 19:09:01 The ETF MTUM follows similar methodology. targets stocks with strong risk-adjusted price performance over the past seven and 13 months...has outperformed S&P500 almost 5% annualized past five years!
433 2018-09-03 19:07:31 I promise tomorrow stocks will be done
434 2018-09-03 19:04:39 Interactive investor services is easy to use £10 commission and online access to deal in US stocks. I also think alongside have an account with a brokerage who has proper, old school dealers who have good r’ship the market makers. Try Killik
435 2018-09-03 19:04:31 After the next crash, there should be some good stocks to pick up at a discount. Just for diversification.  ;-)

451 2018-09-03 18:52:57 Ouch!  I lost 98% on so many stocks during the 2001 dotcom crash.  98% seems to be the magic number.  It doesn’t seem to go below that number for some reason.

464 2018-09-03 18:44:59 Totally agree with Samir. CNBC has warped priorities and the way they focus on stocks like PC Jewellers, Vakrangee etc one wonders about the integrity of the channel. Then they bring Porinju to recommend vague stocks and Anuj goes for a holiday with him!!

477 2018-09-03 18:35:56 Bought my son a share of Nike instead of just keeping his money in the bank. The key is to get stock with dividends, which is interest they give you just for buying it. Bank gives you 1.25% some stocks give you 3-9%

538 2018-09-03 17:42:13 I think the most mind boggling part I’ve learned so far about stocks is that the other side of buying stocks is shorting them. Even when stocks go down in value there’s money to be made from their loss. 
539 2018-09-03 17:41:28 Plus I have down loaded @TDAmeritrade @thinkorswim #ThinkorSwim trading platform to use their active trader feature towards #daytrading either one or more of #Futures #Forex #Stocks
540 2018-09-03 17:41:28 The closest store (I believe) to you that stocks this are our Beckenham stores. If there is anything else I can do please let me know, I will be happy to help. Thanks -Sharon

541 2018-09-03 17:41:13 Unlike you, who rejected a raise for those working men and women in federal jobs. Unlike you, who gave corporations huge tax breaks, which they used to buy back their own stocks, artificially raising their values. Unlike you, who thinks we need an ID to buy food. #ImpeachTrump
542 2018-09-03 17:40:52 live stocks, short/long-sell, etc.
543 2018-09-03 17:40:47 Or people who trade stocks
544 2018-09-03 17:40:38 I got a lot to do today, 1-2 hours until I hit the gym, then after I come I'm gonna spend time re-learning how to edit, then later tonight I'll be studying the stock market, it's Monday so the stock market opens today, been putting money into investments such as weed stocks
545 2018-09-03 17:39:46 But it’s not like he’s giving up his personal wealth. I’m no non-profit expert, but it seems like the foundation makes money by investing in problematic stocks like Walmart and Caterpillar, and gets tax benefits and PR by then investing in questionable social programs.
546 2018-09-03 17:39:26 Have opened my first brokerage account with @TDAmeritrade to have the choice with #Daytrading and #Swingtrading #Stocks #Futures #Forex #options
547 2018-09-03 17:39:19 I cannot imagine a funnier outcome than #Brexiters trying to riot. Perhaps it ought to be encouraged? Would there need to be special access facilities arranged for the Zimmer ones to queue to get into the police vans? And new Tazer stocks for the EDL-type ones?
548 2018-09-03 17:38:49 As a marine biologist, I can ASSURE you that things are quite dire for many commercially fished stocks.Without tight regulation, there will be nothing for them to catch which will have a much bigger impact.I’ve seen the rapid declines with my own eyes-it’s not subject to debate.
549 2018-09-03 17:37:51 Had my first Bloody Mary and I'm ready to talk stocks and yachts

Water companies in the UK are not investing enough in infrastructure and charging customers too much.

They have decided to cut prices 5% by lowering #Shareholder pay.

All their stocks are down.
This is the problem with the #StockMarket.

#ReNationalise them!
552 2018-09-03 17:32:21 I have never invested in stocks until now. The @RobinhoodApp is a good platform. Initially I am focusing on automotive stocks. I bought some shares of Fiat Chrysler and STMicroelectronics
553 2018-09-03 17:29:22 I get text and email alerts from TD as well as a free app that is not required to be open. “Real time Stocks tracker”. Can be price, %, one time or recurring, etc
554 2018-09-03 17:26:40 he remembers most F&O stocks daily high low and closing price at finger tips. Got this about him this when I met him personally
555 2018-09-03 17:26:25 I got ur point. The reason I asked them to unfollow me is because I am writing only on stocks. investments on Quora as well as on Twitter. So, if they don't want to read on Quora, which is detailed, what's the use of reading titbits on Twitter. I don't give target prices anyway.
556 2018-09-03 17:25:19 My favorite "story" stocks are ones where a chart of EPS starts in the lower left and continues on to the upper right.
557 2018-09-03 17:25:14 People keep saying the economy is doing so great because of #Trump. But not for people I know who don’t own stocks, who can’t afford to buy a house, and the wealthy money is tighter than ever. I’m lucky. But my taxes went up substantially w the “tax cuts”.
558 2018-09-03 17:24:13 Omg.. So many newbies misunderstand this game. Sub-penny stocks are severely manipulated. They get a couple of wins&think they are gurus then get wrecked by being cocky. Stop making excuses..Bashers(the truthful ones) expose the red flags.Research them and stop crying.
559 2018-09-03 17:24:13 The best way to accumulate quality stocks is when they are selling off, not when everyone is buying. Quality stocks with fundamentals on their side which fall the hardest, rise very fast in an upturn. Bajaj Fin. HUL, Balkrishna Ind. Reliance, M&M fell 4-10% in 1 wk. More to go.
560 2018-09-03 17:22:58 Yes let’s do away with anti-begging regulations. Vermont’s #homeless stocks are really threatened. #ACLU will be victorious when 4 or 5 million more homeless people move into the state and camp at the #ShelburneMuseum and move into the States libraries.
561 2018-09-03 17:22:57 There are family members and friends in my world  that continue to support him.  Charisma with promises that they will wait for. One person it’s about money/stocks I imagine.
562 2018-09-03 17:22:52 Economy's up. Stocks up (so retirement plans up). Unemployment at historic lows for multiple demos...

566 2018-09-03 17:20:07 That's going to make most investors want to have more money in stocks than they're "supposed" to and will also push some investors toward high-beta assets, potentially causing those assets to underperform leveraged low-beta assets.
567 2018-09-03 17:19:14 Previous to this statement must have when he told Marty Nesbitt to short the stocks of the companies he would bankrupt.”He & Nesbitt did the same type of thing with private business schools.

569 2018-09-03 17:18:01 The wealthiest 1% of America's aristocracy own 40% of the 30 DOW stocks. If the economy is so great. Why are they now destroying labor unions who give the middle class legal representation for the working person??
570 2018-09-03 17:16:02 You can try your local Kinokuniya bookstore! I’m in Singapore and my store just received stocks today.
571 2018-09-03 17:14:52 Not sure I got the question. Market cap is price*number of shares/coins. I think you may be referring to volume, which can be unreliable in crypto and could be smaller than reported. Volume of stocks is regulated so shouldn't be funny business there

While stocks are finally back testing new all-time highs, the volatility market is well off of its yearly lows, a divergence that has been problematic for stocks the past 2 decades...

582 2018-09-03 17:05:43 You spoke about dollars. The one thing we’ve been discussing this whole time that is relevant to their dollars is their stocks.

586 2018-09-03 17:03:19 @NewYorker could rectify the situation by replacing Bannon with a massive cancerous tumor. Alternatively, they could place Bannon in stocks onstage and let the audience pelt him with rotten vegetables.

589 2018-09-03 17:00:07 We all want our stocks to hit their targets in a hurry, life too has a target and I'm sure none of us want to hit that target in a hurry...enjoy the journey and when you finally hit that target, just smile and look back, all of it would be priceless!!
590 2018-09-03 16:59:30 Non sequitur

That has nothing to do with what I just said. I wasn’t talking about their stocks in that comment. I was talking about your blind sheep-esque attitude.
591 2018-09-03 16:59:25 My stocks and 401-k has increased significantly. We no longer have to pay for substandard health insurance. More money in our paychecks. No more Common Core. Changing the tax code.  Helped my son/dad (vet). Hope for the future.
592 2018-09-03 16:59:06 Yeah. It did good cause it’s no basic pack. Did something different than others, gave actual tips to learn instead just stocks.
593 2018-09-03 16:57:38 YES, SHE DOES. Pot stocks are her new way to get rich, when Tupperware and Amway and Equinox and Home Interiors and everything else didn't work.

601 2018-09-03 16:53:59 Bill Ackman is a hack and his comments about certain stocks at conferences like SALT are more dangerous to the average investor than helpful.
602 2018-09-03 16:53:30 Yeah but as far as stocks are concerned, the most recent fluctuation and the numbers in red are actually important. There could be a downward trend continuing but you just wouldn’t know since there’s only so much data that a statistician (or a team of them) could gather

606 2018-09-03 16:47:47 Nah. My job disincentivizes investing in individual stocks. Also, I just have a problem with BS.
607 2018-09-03 16:47:02 Somebody sounds bitter! Progress stocks must have fallen even further today.
608 2018-09-03 16:44:25 STOCKS TO WATCH: Short positions are seen being added in stocks of South Indian Bank, CG Power, ITC, Tata Motors, Reliance, BEL, Powergrid, Suzlon, Escorts, Canara Bank, Infosys, SAIL and YES Bank.

613 2018-09-03 16:42:25 - Invest into companies you know about and are interested in. You’ll know when something good or bad will happen to a stock if you actually know about a company. Also just save up and buy one share of Apple so you get the feel for stocks. Like the ups and downs, but you

617 2018-09-03 16:39:38 Adding onto your 2nd point, if they have not convert to fiat, they would have a big risk exposure. It is like working in the retail and heavily investing in retail stocks. If the retail market tanks, you are out of job + investment loss. Double whammy.
618 2018-09-03 16:38:49 No. They should hire someone who knows how to do treasury management who will make the appropriate decisions on which assets to hold, with a risk / return that makes sense for that startup. 

Stocks, bonds, crypto, multiple fiat, etc.

Exactly as is done with large fiat raises.

Hopefully a better tomorrow 
624 2018-09-03 16:34:08 POTUS's economic policies are uplifting the super rich by giving them big tax and big returns on their stocks. Most Americans don't earn stocks and their wages are stagnant. Not too uplifting. Plus, the trade war is hurting workers, farmers and businesses.
625 2018-09-03 16:34:01 It's illegal to land sea bass in the UK during the whole of 2018. Our stocks are in a bad way. Very bad.

626 2018-09-03 16:33:34 Big progress for the wealthy as they watch corporate profits soar and their retirement stocks increase.  The rest of America watches as their wages remain stagnate, their health care covers less and less, and your deficit threatens to take away Medicare and social security.
627 2018-09-03 16:31:14 Top 10% own 84% of stocks - so more than the top 1% but your point well taken. I worry more for the mom & pop investors who will be devastated when their 401ks and IRAs get shellacked...again. Many Baby Boomers will not have the option to return to work as they did a decade ago.
628 2018-09-03 16:30:29 Except they aren’t doing that. They never do that-anytime they are given more money-they treat themselves/Buy back stocks. It never goes back down the food chain in a meaningful way.
629 2018-09-03 16:29:26 Publically traded means the companies stocks are available to trade by the public, via stock indexes. That it only applies to them is irrelevant. This is serious intervention by the state to enforce a quota system. This should frighten you.
630 2018-09-03 16:28:46 That's not the way to look at it. Enforced savngs, adds discipline to finances and in many cases saves the retirement for those who hung on. This is simply due to the fact that most people are emotional about stocks, but a house is not something you liquidate on impulse.
631 2018-09-03 16:27:07 It’s a tough one. Tweeting whilst working full time means it’s hard to respond in a timely manner. Some stocks will move fast, others may not.
632 2018-09-03 16:24:39 true.. that’s why I’ve been on paper stocks and tiny buys for over a year. Learned A LOT from paper stocks on stockfuse.

635 2018-09-03 16:22:49 For those working in bigger corporations, have you taken advantage of your company’s stocks and shares scheme yet?
636 2018-09-03 16:22:47 Stocks?
637 2018-09-03 16:22:01 Never buy commodity stocks ONLY because the valuation is cheap. Commodity stocks are to be bought when the multiples appear expensive and sold when the multiples appear cheap.
638 2018-09-03 16:21:41 @cirrusdriver if stocks and bonds move together as have been last few yrs, this becomes a leveraged risk portfolio, doesn't it?

651 2018-09-03 16:15:11 If you're going to worry about short-term volatility, you're just not going to be able to buy the cheapest stocks. With the cheapest stocks, the outlooks are uncertain. -- Richard Pzena
652 2018-09-03 16:15:11 As MMS said, in the long run, we are all dead. #Demonetisation was an organized plunder. Almost all black money people had was converted through official or unofficial channels. Did some of its find its way into #stocks?
653 2018-09-03 16:14:36 Unless Pence was to continue the fight against the DEMs' sending jobs to foreigners, raising taxes to squash earnings, raising regulation after regulation that makes owning and operating a profitable business impossible, without  @realDonaldTrump, stocks would sink.
654 2018-09-03 16:11:12 Not sure. However, Chinese New Year is around February, most factories in China will be on holidays. So, production will probably be completed by January I assume. Production would have been completed by then, The delay is mostly from Bandai holding onto the stocks I guess.

666 2018-09-03 16:03:06 If you’re holding stocks, assets, digital assets, you need to overlook them. It’s the cost of ownership anything. I don’t advocate day trading, but oversight of more long term trends. Those that bash trading are more REKT than you are. HODL is a meme.

672 2018-09-03 15:59:36 Salut. Aucune info pour le moment mais si tu n'as pas reçu de mails d'annulation, ça sent bon à priori. Ceux qui ont eu leur commande annulée l'ont eu assez rapidement. Et je pense que si il n'y avait pas de stocks, ils auraient annulé plus vite. Encore un peu de patience ;)

679 2018-09-03 15:53:15 It is very important to remember that a stock's price move is more than 50% directly related to its sector & industry group. So, only buy the strongest stocks in the strongest groups and keep the odds on your side.

684 2018-09-03 15:48:38 Ordinary working Americans have had no real increase. In wages and have shared only 5% of weslth created by GDP while top 1 % shared 95%. Few own stocks and  most are paying more for energy and Trumpcare. Union jobs have better pay and benefits than nonunion Another Trump FAIL
685 2018-09-03 15:47:13 whether we’re talking population growth, stocks, the mortgage market, or the discovery of a newfound resource, the pattern is clear:

686 2018-09-03 15:46:12 When has the Street ever been right on precious metals? Street is a fantastic contrarian indicator. Stocks are ridiculously overvalued at near year 2000 levels whereas Silver is historically undervalued. I buy low, sell high. Looking for $500 Silver in 2020/21.
687 2018-09-03 15:45:35 Thanks for the response.I appreciate you consider this in case that happens .Its sad that regulators don t know yet that 2 3 weeks is a lot of time in crypto comparing to traditional stocks and a lot of things can happen price wise. It can hurt you or us depending on the movement
688 2018-09-03 15:45:19 They were always ‘while stocks/production runs last’ weren’t they? Maybe they’ll redo them, but I suspect the recent sales figures haven’t been great.

696 2018-09-03 15:36:09 And don’t forget he wants to lower the capital gains tax. And since low, low-middle & mid income folks own lots of stocks that’ll be a big help for we peons.

704 2018-09-03 15:29:31 @themotleyfool I can't believe you are recommending that everyday investors actually buy chancy stocks on speculation. If you HAD an investment advice license, you'd lose it doing this. 
What the heck HAPPENED to you?
705 2018-09-03 15:29:05 I recommended about 50 stocks. 48 were terrible but I got lucky with Netflix and Tesla.
Does that make me a good stock picker?
706 2018-09-03 15:28:59 Wow! Good for him!!!! Geez stop bragging. Not everyone is as great at recommending stocks. Smh
707 2018-09-03 15:28:37 It's #LaborDay :

Workers wages are stagnant (at best), the minimum wage is unlivable, the president attacks unions, and stocks benefit mostly the ultra wealthy.

714 2018-09-03 15:26:01 My two cents, GL on your return.   I don't trade these type of stocks but the few successful traders I know that do, use fewer setups that they trade. Also, experimenting like you were during probably the slowest months for small caps, trading smaller definitely would be better.

Wait for the target of 70 at either side and stop loss can be at 28 of combined premium contraction .

723 2018-09-03 15:23:03 Exactly. I'm worried about the emotional reaction. The figures speak for themselves but managing your response to losing a significant portion of your wealth will be tough. I used to pick stocks and lost big on a few. It hurts!
724 2018-09-03 15:22:52 What a great president stocks on rise, making interest on bank accounts. Got nice raise because of corporate tax cuts. All is GREAT.
725 2018-09-03 15:21:05 If Tesla don’t have the cash to pay the bondholders they can force them to take stocks instead since it’s convertible bonds.
If that’s the case guess what the bondholders will do with these stocks as soon as they get them?

726 2018-09-03 15:21:03 Va falloir refaire les stocks !!!
727 2018-09-03 15:20:54 True sir he also bought bodal chemicals at 170 look the price now . It is not advisable to blindly buy ace investor stocks.

735 2018-09-03 15:13:20 I'm old school when it comes to investing, especially in #cryptocurrency.  That's why I have a HODL strategy in btc & eth.

Alt-coins, to me, is like day trading penny stocks.  I don't have the stomach. However, give me your one alt-coin pick to research.

758 2018-09-03 14:59:02 Le mandataire m’a simplement renvoyé vers une concession Volkswagen, qui « vidait ses stocks » de Polo et donc baissait les prix. J’ai économisé pas grand chose, environ 700€, mais j’ai eu une voiture que n’importe qui d’autre aurait eu dans la concession

775 2018-09-03 14:46:14 Of course you can get to cash flow positive. It all depends on leverage and time.

If you borrowed 100% and purchased stocks.....you would also be cash flow negative.

787 2018-09-03 14:40:16 Yes but it wasn’t when we bought it, it was one of the most hated stocks on aim. #ADL looks to have turned a page too although I need a few questions answered before I become fully confident.
788 2018-09-03 14:39:37 TRUTH ...yes we are the laughing stocks of the world ( so embarrassing ....the clowns that elected him .....should crawl under rocks and hide or apply for name changes )

Mahrsh Sir - Ma'am Aarati was right. Most guys do incomplete reading, can't even read one article and go to buy stocks
790 2018-09-03 14:38:12 Where have you been? I guess you missed the Obana apology tour and his bowing to foreign leaders? I guess libs live in their own fantasy world. Please watch stocks and economy, you might learn something!

803 2018-09-03 14:28:14 When the thirst for wealth becomes general, it will be sought for as well dishonestly as honestly; by frauds and overreachings, by the knaveries of trade, the heartlessness of greedy speculation, by gambling in stocks and commodities that soon demoralizes a whole community.
804 2018-09-03 14:26:33 He like coal burning because it’s a revenue stream for some rich fuck. R there any stocks trading coal? They have to cut the price to make it affordable so they cut the wages of the people that harvest it. Not the coal, it’s price is stable. Pretty soon peep will pay to dig it up

811 2018-09-03 14:22:33 Normally I would agree absolutely bullish... but in an unregulated market @ThinkingUSD does not mention the possibility it is just wash trading. Someone shorting into their own hidden buy walls to influence perceptions of the charts. I have seen people arrested for this in stocks

815 2018-09-03 14:18:37 It certainly does make a difference @douglaslittle. Here's another perspective for you, Canada regulates the industry, harvests energy rich stocks and sends some of that cash to impoverished countries. Will renewable energy replace that support? This is just one example.

819 2018-09-03 14:14:39 But there isn't a single way of measuring this. Eg the way MSCI chooses to do it may (as it seems it does) be tilted towards growth stocks, which outperformed for non-ESG related reasons. And all active investors will always say they are screening risk, it's their job.
820 2018-09-03 14:14:27 I can’t bc my AP Stat teacher would play moneyball every year probably twice and then was obsessed with the big short and also all the finance/business guys are too busy watching their stocks for movies

827 2018-09-03 14:07:06 @TriggaTrade This post is old, at the time I had been trading only stocks for awhile  to focus on it and learn my system. Back at the end of July I did futures and forex again. I find that for me, I learn a universe a lot better if I focus on it, otherwise it takes me forever.
828 2018-09-03 14:07:05 @TheBullBull  Sunil sir— one q- if you can please share your opinion. If i want to invest in shares SEP way- which are the stocks to buy. 30/40 k per month.
829 2018-09-03 14:07:00 It's hard to say if the good things in economy is due to you, but you'll take credit when stocks are up. You go quite pr blame Obama if stocks go down. You're still culpable in all these Mueller probes. Ask Cohen.
830 2018-09-03 14:06:55 O'Donald's stock market bragging is ludicrous. 50% of households in the US have NO money tied to equity markets. 80+% of all stocks are held by the top 10% of earners. A vast number of his supporters gain nothing by a rising market, but a market crash may take all their jobs.
831 2018-09-03 14:06:33 I think that recessions are fake.  And that the people who run the show. Just collapse the economy once In a while and buy up stocks and propert when it’s cheap.  Great Recession led to the federal reserve starting.  Sucks the elites have been doing this forever
832 2018-09-03 14:05:31 This post is a bit old, at the time I had been trading only stocks for awhile just to focus on it and learn my system.

835 2018-09-03 14:03:03 I still trade futures and forex and actually looking at getting into options a little. However, most of my capital is in stocks for sure because you need it to make money there. I switched to stocks because it limits my risk and my system trading style is strong there.

882 2018-09-03 13:36:47 Not so.  Not only has Trump terminated most Obama executive orders, he's reversed his globalist agenda by staying out of the Paris accord and TPP, effectively erasing Obozo's legacy.

1163 2018-09-03 08:23:10 I have a real idea: What about a market transaction tax. When you place a bid, you don't acquire the stocks from the company but a middleman sees your bid, buys it and sells it to you with an increased price. If taxed it would end up in education etc. and not with corporations!

1167 2018-09-03 08:22:10 Thx Brian...I’m always suspicious of press articles that appear on heavily shorted stocks...especially so when the article resolutely refuses to address any bull case

1385 2018-09-03 05:08:50 I always love September as during the summer I can always build positions and during September the city returns from holidays school starts and liquidity returns to the market. Pushing a lot of undervalued stocks higher. #LSE #LondonStockExchange
1386 2018-09-03 05:06:46 Down again this morning.copper below crucial 6000 mark.more tarrifs 4 china.most metal prices down.killing many metal mining stocks
1387 2018-09-03 05:06:01 They deserve irons, then the stocks, followed by a shower of rotten produce, fecal matter and detritus, culminating in a long, miserable prison sentence.
1388 2018-09-03 05:04:45 I don’t think so Emma, other countries but not Jamaica. It time to close these seasons for a few years and police the stocks to give them time to recover. Even TCI stocks are dangerously low.
1389 2018-09-03 05:04:15 It depends the character my opponent is playing and what character I am playing
If I'm someone like peach and they are fox then I would hold and try and hold more stocks and play slower
1390 2018-09-03 05:04:08 Asian stocks dip on trade, emerging market woes.
1391 2018-09-03 05:01:11 Trump wants to move ahead with imposing tariffs on $200b in Chinese imports next week. China threatened to retaliate with duties on $60b of U.S. goods. The U.S. has so far imposed levies on $50 billion in Chinese goods, with Beijing retaliating in kind. Stocks fell on the news.
1392 2018-09-03 04:58:44 @RBX_Coeptus Can you just PLEASE add an investing option? This may be confusing, but let me explain. Ok, so basically there would be companies like Pizza Planet and Mike's Motors and other stuff, and then there would be a website saying the stocks prices, then you choose which.
1393 2018-09-03 04:58:28 My dumbest Smash memory was in Melee. I was 14 years old and did a 99 stock match with my sister and two CPUs. Randomized stage and it picked fucking Poke Floats. My sister quit after losing like 10 stocks. But I'm the strong sibling so I played that shit out for hours.
1394 2018-09-03 04:55:04 Literally, the exact opposite is true. Except, obviously for you. You are happy because Trump's 4.2% GDP, lowest unemployment in 18 years, lowest black unemployment in HISTORY, stocks booming, economy booming. Just like the rest of us Trump supporters, who are ECSTATIC! Join us!

1396 2018-09-03 04:54:40 Yes, he was complaining about inability to catch conch - another highly vulnerable species. Basically they are all scrambling to catch declining stocks, to ship to China. I wonder if the Government gives sea cucumber licenses?? @micafjamaica @zpnine

1400 2018-09-03 04:50:48 I think it would depend on how limited. How much can rules & settings be changed would be my biggest factor. Even if it was only a dozen characters, if I could tweak a lot of the rules/settings like meter smash, stocks, time, rage, etc. then yea
1401 2018-09-03 04:50:35 You might consider letting your algorith go another couple of decimal places further, this stocks dividend is I think $0.0025.

1410 2018-09-03 04:44:20 The fees gave us access to a market and other EU benefits so we lose out overall. The EU already has trade agreements which we benefit from. CFP protects fish stocks so we would need something similar in place. CAP would also need replacement. How does this save money?

1416 2018-09-03 04:34:31 Yes. The Frank-Dodd legislation held big banks accountable for loans they approve. There was a flood of sub prime mortgages pumping up stocks by buying bad risks without proper oversight. When the bubble burst, Congress stepped in to require proper risk.

1439 2018-09-03 04:03:07 Outrageous and infuriating to see kids deliberately failed by adults who steal from their futures. Bring back the stocks.
1440 2018-09-03 04:03:00 You start with investing in 100 stocks. Analyse them quarterly or annually based on your style. Some wil be out and some will be added based on performance. I suppose you will be starting to get stocks rising 10 fold from second year onwards.

1482 2018-09-03 03:17:18 2017 was a great year for international stocks vs American. International stocks are taking a breather but when American empire collapses, one best hope to be hedged in international stocks and emerging economies.

1509 2018-09-03 02:51:54 Real wages going down for 30+ years but nice try.  Buybacks "artificially" inflating stock prices? Says who? Nice conjecture.  Sounds like u r yet another who missed making a fortune in stocks since the election.  Stop being so negative and enjoy the prosperity
1510 2018-09-03 02:51:34 Except that the most recent tax cuts were used by corporate America to buy back their stocks thus (further) inflating their value.  This really isn’t going to end well.

1583 2018-09-03 01:53:14 It's a non-story. The state farmed out some of it's pension money to a hedge fund that bought some AM stock, no doubt among scores of other stocks.
1584 2018-09-03 01:51:48 This is such crap. CA, OH and NJ gave a bit of their pension business to a hedge fund that has invested in AM stock. Probably as one of a hundred stocks they own.

1638 2018-09-03 00:32:36 I feel for you but we are paying more now. Corporate tax will have to go up anyway. We can’t live in a society where only the middle class pay for government spending. Corporations will have to pay more taxes or pay workers more however, they opted to buy back their stocks

1640 2018-09-03 00:30:07 ...I have a problem with growth-stock investing. Companies tend not to grow at high rates forever. Businesses change... Markets mature. Competition can increase. Good managements can retire... the market is littered with once highly profitable growth stocks... -- Ed Wachenheim
1641 2018-09-03 00:28:43 Yes we still have stocks!! To be on-hand 
1642 2018-09-03 00:28:13 If you’re in Brisbane, there’s a shop called My Cube in Westfield Garden City that sells BTS albums and merches and you can order from them directly if it stocks out :)
1643 2018-09-03 00:25:01 Squad strike is like that thing in lxp where you have for example five stocks and a different character each stock, right?
1644 2018-09-03 00:24:40 #リアルタイム #トレード #デイトレ #オプション ｽﾄﾗﾄﾞﾙ(とｽﾄﾗﾝｸﾞﾙ)はhot stocks(グーグル、アマゾン、ネットﾌﾘｯｸｽのような)は場合は特に高いんですよね。だから予想程 利益乗らない、BE以下の状態に留まる事多し。

1650 2018-09-03 00:14:36 My son was hired by Trader Joe’s 9 years after having a brain bleed that left him with multiple issues including no use of his right arm. He stocks shelves one handed. He has a degree in architecture he can no longer use. I’m grateful for his fortitude and TJ’s for hiring him.

1652 2018-09-03 00:10:53 How many disbarred lawyers do you see?
1653 2018-09-03 00:10:21 Ey homie while you were trading stocks and doing million dollar deals Phil swift made a new clear flex tape. CLEAR!!! imagine the possibilities the
1654 2018-09-03 00:10:09 It's TRUE. Not matter how great everything is going for them now, ex: 401k, lower taxes higher paychecks, stocks and bonds booming...... they DO NOT CARE. Or like the trolls I work with... its ALL bc of OBAMA. And I should be thankful. Its NOT bc of Trump!!?? 
1655 2018-09-03 00:08:43 I did stop him, but the other guys must have felt bad and threw their stocks
1656 2018-09-03 00:08:25 The way Zuck moves. You’re right they had a chance to partner with Facebook and messed that up. That’s why I moved my money from snapchat stocks to Facebook stocks. Because IGtv bout to be serious.
1657 2018-09-03 00:06:50 I went to Festival yesterday and are sold out in all sizes except size 10 :(, Basket would be in stocks by November...I asked the sales lady there.
1658 2018-09-03 00:06:19 The market is only a measure of your wealth if you own stocks. Do you? Cuz I don't. I'm too busy trying to feed babies with the $6 I've got left after rent, insurance, and the car payment. That "tax bill" didn't help me and I bet it didn't help you. It helped Wall St. investors.
1659 2018-09-03 00:04:56 If I recall correctly, 1 year ago Trump was president. And wasn't it just days after the election when the stock market started to rise? And stocks rise and fall all the time, so just stop with the "chicken little" nonsense. 
1660 2018-09-03 00:04:11 I have the same problem! If you can track down their brunette version, it helps a lot. Not everywhere stocks it though. *sigh*
1661 2018-09-03 00:01:11 How can be people disapprove?  Taxes are lower. Stocks are high record unemployment????
