1 2018-12-19 23:59:26 Hey institutional investors... with the Dow Jones and traditional stocks tanking... maybe it's time to look at bitcoin and cryptocurrency.
2 2018-12-19 23:59:10 Asian stocks looked set to decline after U.S. equities swung from gains to losses as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell failed to quell investor concerns that tightening policy will choke economic growth.
3 2018-12-19 23:58:36 Yep that is the thing I think is most screwed up. Bump stock owners who paid for the stocks don’t get reimbursed yet they have to turn them in.
4 2018-12-19 23:58:16 Investing in yourself is the BEST investment. People always think about stocks when it comes to investing. You'll make & sustain the most money and happiness by investing in YOURSELF.

We live in a world where when you love yourself you're looked down upon as selfish. Nah fam.

8 2018-12-19 23:57:35 Uh, you I want any less firepower to defend my family than the thugs have who come to do them harm?  Banning bump stocks simply means that criminals and madmen get to keep theirs.  Nope.  If need be, I’ll use mine against them to defend myself and family.
9 2018-12-19 23:56:57 I really want to invest my money into stocks or something but I reallllly don’t want to get screwed 
10 2018-12-19 23:56:50 Ummm. Apparently you don't Mr. Conservative. We didn't tolerate Obama using the Executive branch to make laws. Moreover, the DOJ has labeled bump stocks as machine guns in order to fit the original law. What happens when a Democrat gets in the Oval Office??
11 2018-12-19 23:56:46 I'd throw him in stocks for even mentioning the word. I don't even want to hear them discussing the league until its on a bus going through Liverpool.
12 2018-12-19 23:56:22 Bump stocks are ridiculous to serious tactical shooters.

but ban them the right way, with legislation. Not an illegal EO that redefines the definition of machine gun without changing the wording of the statute.

14 2018-12-19 23:56:04 Yes.  The Fed is choking out the DoD.  Should be interesting to watch in 2019.  Defense stocks already acting like crap.
15 2018-12-19 23:55:47 Literally no one even owns bump stocks. It’s about the precedent.
16 2018-12-19 23:55:38 Because the ATF and DOJ do not have unilateral authority to reclassify what a machine gun/fully automatic firearm is. The law is very clear on its definition of fully automatic firearms, bump stocks do not fit that legal definition.

42 2018-12-19 23:54:11 No thanks....lost enough listening to you about natural gas stocks.
43 2018-12-19 23:53:38 STOCKS..."long-term investors" are catching on to the BS.  In past, when  market was going to decline, "smart money, went to cash while  "long-term investors"hung in there...then when things looked good, smart  money bought cheap with the money they had taken out of market..
44 2018-12-19 23:53:30 Strong supporter of the 2A and NRA... That being said bump stocks are dumb and unnecessary.  Giving them up to show "we care" is a no Brainer.
45 2018-12-19 23:53:20 but why should the Fed pay much attention to financial markets?  in this case, market has fallen from very high valuation, to a more reasonable one.  why should the Fed take in account that they might need to keep stocks overvalued?
46 2018-12-19 23:53:17 Were getting diamond tonight.
Minimum.

48 2018-12-19 23:53:10 But the government is not compensating for bump stocks in every city across the US. Was the NRA on board with Trump's ban?
49 2018-12-19 23:52:47 Stocks cannot close in bear market territory.  Only markets.  That's the whole point - in a bear market everything is going down, the good and the bad, so losses are to be expected.  It is when your stock is going down in a bull market that you worry.  #DowTheory
50 2018-12-19 23:52:46 “If you’re buying stocks, you’re fighting the Fed, and that’s not a fight you’re likely to win.”

I look for a meltdown tomorrow on Wall Street.
51 2018-12-19 23:51:50 I miss @spreecoza we never run out of stocks and we always with new trends unlike their new owner 
@superbalist
52 2018-12-19 23:51:41 A good sub plot here would be Trump doing this to make defence stocks go down, thus hurting his political opponents who profit from war. Shorting stocks for extra juice of course. PS Don't know if these stocks declined in today's volatile market.
53 2018-12-19 23:51:38 What happened to Mark Levin? 10 billion to Mexico, no wall, bump stocks?
54 2018-12-19 23:51:37 So why do you continue to tout stocks if you believe this is the right decision?
55 2018-12-19 23:51:34 Bump stocks are just a $200 piece of plastic that help you bump fire a little easier. You can bump fire without a bump stock. It's not going to stop a single shooting because it is not a firearm
56 2018-12-19 23:51:09 Good point.  The original mistake, IMHO, was BB not raising once or twice in 2013.  Set precedent where he and JY let asset prices get out of control.  Many assets other than stocks, too.
57 2018-12-19 23:50:57 People aren't concerned though.. it's "just bump stocks" and "who cares nobody really uses them" but that isn't the point it's the principle of the matter... Incrementalism. If they do this, where does it end??? We're in for a rough run #BumpStockBan
58 2018-12-19 23:50:28 That’s 2-3 years away a lifetime for consumer stocks trying to keep up with the Jones’
59 2018-12-19 23:50:07 Trying to appease Dems since we won the house. They can’t track bump stocks & they are still okay with assault guns. Window dressing because that is also the only damned thing that will happen & a friendly judge will toss it out
60 2018-12-19 23:49:38 Banning bump stocks won’t do shit anyway.
61 2018-12-19 23:49:08 I LOVE guns, and if banning bump stocks could even save one life or prevent a mass shooting, then go ahead and ban them, I’d be ok with it. Fact is this does nothing but make her look good when she in fact had accomplished ZERO good.
62 2018-12-19 23:48:36 I think i get more frustrated playing against someone on bf or fd but with 2 stocks then i do playing on a random stage with items on and 3 stocks. Like cmon man this aint smash 4
63 2018-12-19 23:48:30 My stocks took a savage beating today 
64 2018-12-19 23:48:22 #Blockchain #Crypto Can you send this chart to the "non-manipulative" (wink, wink) #market maker please? 
Just in case the sec reads this: we hate manipulation guys. We hate accumulation, we hate pumps. We hate shakeouts. We hate massive gains. We love slow gains like stocks.
65 2018-12-19 23:48:09 Fortify Walmart and hope this one stocks guns an ammo
66 2018-12-19 23:48:03 old FG rules were for smash 4
they dont work for ultimate because the game is faster, and 2 stocks gives too much of an advantage to whoever takes the first stock
67 2018-12-19 23:47:49 The Economy 
Since 2000 or earlier
Our economy has been reported on Wall Street stocks making it or breaking it off the Stock Market Because control of our wealth is in our 401K money making new wealth like owning a home in the 50’s made future wealth for the Rich & middle class
68 2018-12-19 23:47:43 I cannot support those who support a ban on bump-stocks.  Whether someone owns or shoots for pleasure, hunting, or defense is not the question. The question is one of rights, restrictions, and the slippery slope of regulation. The US Code already is an infringement by itself.
69 2018-12-19 23:47:43 Liberals" Stocks are tanking..it is Trump's fault. This is Trump's economy
FEDS" The Economy has been very strong so we must increase rates"
Liberals: "This is Obama's economy"
Me: God works in amazing ways. They tried to tank the economy to spite Trump but the FEDS came through
70 2018-12-19 23:47:27 Stock markets meltdown coming up. 70% of my investment portfolio (my super fund which I manage myself) is now in cash. Stocks which I bought low and will add to on dips on the ASX include: MYR, TELSTRA, APT, AMP.
71 2018-12-19 23:47:24 On 25/11/2009, I started a new volume of the book where I keep track of my valuations of stocks. Page 1 = $PPT.AX which was $32.66 - I thought was cheap. With dividends, u had 32% return 2 today from a few months off bottom of a bear market over 9 years. Wrong. Look at board rem.
72 2018-12-19 23:47:07 Prediction: The bump-stock ban will not actually save a single life and will increase violence (perpetrated by government agents against owners of "illegal" bump stocks).
73 2018-12-19 23:47:03 So I guess the militia also needs tanks, rocket launchers, anti aircraft weaponry, etc? Correct? I mean, if they need bump stocks to prevent a government takeover, why wouldn’t they need everything? 
74 2018-12-19 23:46:54 I don't criticize President Trump often, but when he does something I legitimately disagree with I will not hesitate to publicly say so. President Trump violated our 2nd amendment rights by deciding to remove bump stocks. Conservatives must fight this and take it to the courts.
75 2018-12-19 23:46:51 Bump stocks are a useless accessory
76 2018-12-19 23:46:45 Theses #deepstate liberals are killing my stocks
77 2018-12-19 23:46:42 It’s a given until it’s not (ie, when stocks enter bear market territory)
78 2018-12-19 23:46:27 Does Nibbling Lindzon mean you are nibbling long stocks at this point?
79 2018-12-19 23:46:27 Why don’t you tell him it’s called inflation... and PCE is at target and will roll over (won’t be symmetrical unless 1.5% is the target ) and stocks are a measure of asset prices and they are  deflating... pause today would have been better policy... but gotta counter DJT 
80 2018-12-19 23:45:39 Bump stocks

Next up on the "Don't Impeach Me, Bro" list of shit Trump will do a 180° on? My money is on Flake's carbon tax.
81 2018-12-19 23:45:23 Well first of all, gunsmith, bump stocks aren't full auto...
82 2018-12-19 23:44:46 In the meantime, our stocks-based retirement funds are dwindling, rapidly.
Thanks a lot, Trump.
83 2018-12-19 23:44:44 Why is CEO salary a write off?  
Bc they're paid in stocks?  

That needs to be corrected.  Once again the rich getting richer.
84 2018-12-19 23:43:25 And now you sound like the NRA and Trump are your biggest chums. FYI bump stocks have never been used in a school shooting.
85 2018-12-19 23:43:09 J’en peux plus de ces barrières PARTOUT ! Comment en est-on arrivé là ? On a des stocks à rentabiliser ?
86 2018-12-19 23:43:07 @ChrisCuomo ur bro must be fuming.  trump banned bump stocks and did criminal justice reform before him. hahahha. boom
87 2018-12-19 23:42:59 Just getting off work ! Missed most of crypto and stocks today. Was in couple of positions in stocks but able to close them as they started to drop.
88 2018-12-19 23:42:57 @WoodysGamertag am I dumping more money into SPY or am I picking up some juicy on sale dividend stocks?
89 2018-12-19 23:42:53 If you move your stocks or IRA from one exchange to another, no gains tax. Sb same w crypto - taxed when converted.
90 2018-12-19 23:42:40 So now Dianne Feinstein rejects ATF review of bump stocks, while Trump is more critical
91 2018-12-19 23:41:38 There will be no financial crisis for the next 60yrs

#stocks
92 2018-12-19 23:41:36 Hes the set up they put in saying stocks are strong , funny how he talks up stocks and the fall
93 2018-12-19 23:41:30 Very near term yes, but the math doesn’t work w/o devaluing USD unless stocks rise on low volatility
94 2018-12-19 23:41:30 Let’s be clear here.  Liberals are for troops stationed in Syria.   Next Question: any reaction to Trump banning bump stocks?  
95 2018-12-19 23:41:25 Stocks about to dump and crypto will be end up being the alternative for investors #CallingIt
96 2018-12-19 23:40:46 When do they step in and start buying stocks?
97 2018-12-19 23:40:33 Sorry this guy didn't learn about trading stocks. I did in high school. History class actually. We had a project where we would hypothetically buy and sell stocks that lasted a month.
98 2018-12-19 23:40:07 Didn’t realize that stocks are in the pooper today because interest rates went up.
It’s fine and necessary, though.

I’m curious what the interest rate would be without The Fed.
99 2018-12-19 23:39:58 10 breakouts: $EFZ. One sub-$1. Not surprisingly, despite a respectable number of candidates none were stocks or ETFs worthy of attention
100 2018-12-19 23:39:55 Banning bump stocks is like banning semiautomatic weapons it’s one step closer. I think that the far left had someone make the bumpstocks to get banned to make a umbrella loophole law to ban semiautomatic weapons. I know crazy thinking but think of what we are dealing with. 
101 2018-12-19 23:39:43 I know not many people are gonna like what I am saying about the bump stocks ban, but I kind of support it. That does not mean I support the infringement of the Second Amendment, but you have to look at it this way: it is not like he decides to ban all guns...
102 2018-12-19 23:39:17 Well, 2 good things. He banned bump stocks, too. That doesn’t mean he isn’t an abomination as president, shouldn’t be in jail, is a horrible human being, and is not worthy of the office. 2 out of 100 doesn’t make for a net positive and won’t change how history views him.
103 2018-12-19 23:38:55 It's not the first time. A generation of investors stayed out of the stock market after the 1929 crash and again after the dismal 1970s. It took more than a decade before the children of those who lost a lot money in stocks took a look.
104 2018-12-19 23:38:36 I have “lost” more money in stocks than bitcoin this year. Sucks!
105 2018-12-19 23:38:18 what hedge fund manager who actually trades stocks blows up twitter 100's of times a day along with a blog on real money pro?? answer: NO ONE.  if actually ran a hedge fund he wouldn't have time. He runs real money pro, ,not a hedge fund obviously
106 2018-12-19 23:37:38 My fantasy is old-school.  Tarred and feathered, then put in the stocks where we can throw rotten tomatoes.  THEN, jail for a long time.
107 2018-12-19 23:37:36 Someone got the link to the Stocks on the Stock Market for this. I'm about to buy cheap before the prices rise
108 2018-12-19 23:37:17 Oh yes, think of all the mass shootings with evil bump stocks!...(NONE ever)  but someone feels better.
109 2018-12-19 23:37:12 If people bought the gold instead of stocks as a retirement savings they would be millionaires if they aren't billionaires. Free lesson repeated every cycle but who cares?
110 2018-12-19 23:37:05 Maybe we should send all the confiscated bump stocks to Syria ala “Charlie Wilson’s War.”
111 2018-12-19 23:35:38 For INDIAN STOCKS TOO
112 2018-12-19 23:35:31 I think they're making room for the Easter Egg stocks.
113 2018-12-19 23:35:30 Exactly that’s the point that people are missing. Bump stocks have only been legal for just a few years (2012?). It got slipped in thru the ATF. Because of rate of fire and where it’s placed doesn’t quite fit the official description of a fully automatic modification. 
114 2018-12-19 23:35:18 "I'M THE ONE WITH STOCKS!"
115 2018-12-19 23:35:03 Trump is trying to appease the Dems with a window dressing ban on bump stocks. Thinks he can trade toothless legislation for his stupid wall. Also wants to distract us from his crumbling world. They can still buy AR15s, etc. so I’m not impressed.
116 2018-12-19 23:34:43 It should be on the most wanted posters… Banks and post office! Speaking of banks… They have started bail-in procedures… Converting your equities that you purchased and hold in your RRSP’s into bank stocks… Which drop dramatically when there’s a recession!
Ask your bank!
117 2018-12-19 23:34:30 Someone actually used that? Bump stocks for home defense?  Really?
118 2018-12-19 23:34:21 True! But doesn't it seem quiet now. If a Democrat had mandated bump stocks be turned in to Big Gov the Fox News crowd would be screaming about watering the "Tree of Liberty with the blood of tyrants" from the rooftops.

Still...it's a good thing.
119 2018-12-19 23:33:50 I didn’t sell soon enough. I didn’t have a lot of mine I’d stocks. But enough.
120 2018-12-19 23:33:32 Yes but shaming moms into not working presents a false choice. 

Kids have suffered from a system that has been de-mutualized and a system where equity (actual stocks, not an intangible) has been gutted.

The hope is we can all work from home one day and actually produce *things*
121 2018-12-19 23:33:23 I paid myself today from a few different stocks I purchased earlier this year and wow that felt amazing.

124 2018-12-19 23:32:40 #rolleyes I promised to protect this country against all enemies, foreign & domestic. You carry on about bump stocks long enough and you start checking off boxes on the domestic side that bear watching.  Don't like it? Don't be an idiot. #PrettySimple

127 2018-12-19 23:32:04 Hey Ryan, 
Thanks for the tweet. ETFs are not our core offering, they've been included as an additional way to diversify your portfolio. Your $15/month (or our $2.99 plan) let's you invest in individuals stocks instead of a fund. You also get some cool ESG data 
128 2018-12-19 23:31:31 If the Fed keeps going 2019 2nd half isnt looking good. Also, losses on RE and stocks have a chilling effect on spending.
129 2018-12-19 23:30:50 I don’t wanna get into a debate, I understand people’s concerns. I don’t see banning a bump stock as an infringement on my the 2A. I love AR’s and think they’re exceptional defense weapons. Perhaps a good compromise would be to restrict bump stocks the same as automatics
130 2018-12-19 23:30:36 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing #stocks.
131 2018-12-19 23:30:20 first mii i fight online has horrible wifi and plays with 2 stocks

go figure
132 2018-12-19 23:30:03 So now bump stocks are banned.
We don't know a damn thing about the Los Vegas massacre, but it's being used to take away one of our freedoms. Why? Because we let this shit happen, that's why. It's time for us to stand up for ourselves, because the ones we voted to do so, aren't.
133 2018-12-19 23:28:19 Well, it’s not like we have the whole banking system about to collapse though.. stocks were only down 10% from ATH by May 2008, cool 7mo since peaking
134 2018-12-19 23:28:10 1. I'm not "dumping" him.

2. It's not about bump stocks, it's about the Constitution.

Presidents don't have authority to change the law on their own.
135 2018-12-19 23:28:00 Why are you down so much-is it in active funds? Small cap? Are you 100% stocks? What allocation do you want to move to?
136 2018-12-19 23:27:33 John Wayne would have build the wall selling bump stocks!!!
137 2018-12-19 23:26:26 None of that has anything to do with investing in the stock market. Trump will leave office; someone who understands foreign policy & economics takes over; economy recovers. I keep investing: stocks are cheaper now so I’m getting more for my money. I’ll make more in the recovery.
138 2018-12-19 23:25:41 I totally get that. I get the slippery slope argument. I get that we both agree that restricting liberties is bad. A large part of me wishes that there had never been bump stocks. They are a result of Hollywood glorifying spray and pray fire.
139 2018-12-19 23:25:33 Before you get irregular on me I 110% support our 2nd amendment. 

The bump stock is a feature that modifies a legal gun to be illegal. Automatic weapons have been illegal so I'm not upset about bump stocks.

Those who own them should not be  charged with a felony.
140 2018-12-19 23:25:25 ".....this year, an additional 300,000 Mulanje Cedar seedlings can be planted on the mountain from the stocks available at the community group nurseries.  MMCT cannot finance this substantial cost alone."
141 2018-12-19 23:25:16 This is a fight to get more people killed. It infringes zero on our Constitutional rights. Let’s fight real restrictions and ban the dangerous, useless  things like bump stocks.
142 2018-12-19 23:25:15 You kidding me? I'm a real money pro subscriber, are you? Are you aware he's been super long bank stocks for the last two months? JPM, C, BAC, WFC and GS?? and he added ALL  THE WAY DOWN. he's not gonna tell you that on twitter, obviously. He's been destroyed.
143 2018-12-19 23:25:13 #RT @davidhogg111: We got bump-stocks banned!!!

Shout out to all the amazing @AMarch4OurLives chapters that got people to comment on ATFs website to ban bump-stocks.
144 2018-12-19 23:24:57 Unless the 99% found it i dont care. Stocks and wallstreet is all imaginary value
145 2018-12-19 23:24:03 The Trump admin is banning bump stocks? Can't wait to see the Democrats talking about how great bump stocks are
146 2018-12-19 23:23:49 Im starting that when the market turns  fuck yo gpu stocks.
147 2018-12-19 23:23:43 I hold stocks. Have lost money. Still happy though that he showed his middle finger to Trump.  Also he is misunderstood by the likes of Cramer. He showed strong inclination to become data dependent. Real negative for the market isnot these low rates but Trump trade war
148 2018-12-19 23:23:13 What other stocks do you guys like here?
149 2018-12-19 23:23:09 Gonna start investing in stocks. 
150 2018-12-19 23:23:07 My point is, it's not a DEVICE or an ACCESSORY, it's a technique. So, banning bump stocks (and I don't care either way to be honest with you) would be the like NBA banning Nikes thinking it that would keep Michael Jordan from jumping so high.
151 2018-12-19 23:23:05 So you are saying the only money you make is your salary right. Nothing extra no stocks or bonds.
152 2018-12-19 23:22:50 The Fed is completely out of touch. How they could raise interest rates while stocks crash is beyond me. #fed
153 2018-12-19 23:22:48 Stocks are tanking and it the fault of The Federal Reserve!!!
154 2018-12-19 23:22:34 Give credit where credit is due.....thanks Mr. President for banning bump stocks.
155 2018-12-19 23:21:36 The Trump administration has banned bump stocks. Be on the look out for right-wingers blaming this on Obama and/or the Dems. 
156 2018-12-19 23:21:26 its just another market bubble cycle, look at marijuana stocks rn and theyre the exact same as crypto last year. bitcoin goes through crazy growth cycles every 2-3 years. the next one will be demonic and the people that buy at the top are going to be so fucking broke
157 2018-12-19 23:21:09 You can thank the NRA for this, look on their page and read how THEY asked the ATF to rethink bump stocks  ban them, Trump was fine with them till that happened. Read it for yourself. NRA stab us in the back AGAIN. GOA and local state 2A groups fighting for our 2A, NRA spineless
158 2018-12-19 23:20:26 How much of a fee would you be paying reading stocks or bonds at a local broker?

161 2018-12-19 23:20:10 The 'deep-state supporting 'media', screaming about past 400 point drops in stocks over the past week... Now that the 'scam' is evident, they are defending the indefensible- anti-Trump Fed Chairman, Powell... for his 'ruinous' actions upon the stock market.

164 2018-12-19 23:17:09 Because it is not an attack on the 2nd amendment. Bump stocks serve no purpose.
165 2018-12-19 23:16:49 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your depression
166 2018-12-19 23:15:59 A bit of a self-feeding circular reference in the markets:
a) stocks down must be signaling recession 
b) if recession then need to sell stocks
167 2018-12-19 23:15:37 All the goths need it for hibernation this winter, get the stocks in 
168 2018-12-19 23:14:33 Tweet about how great stocks are Donald @realDonaldTrump!
169 2018-12-19 23:14:33 Cant we just buy pledis' stocks so they will listen to us  so they wont have any choice but to come to our terms
170 2018-12-19 23:14:23 Can't seriously compare ISIS presence west v. east of Euphrates. In latter, they controlled major urban centers *for yrs*, had access to stocks of cash & an oil trade operation, moved heavy weaponry via uninterrupted supply lines, recruited out of *millions* of locals, etc
171 2018-12-19 23:14:16 Get what you wanted. Like the ultra rich getting richer. A recession in the making. Stocks plummeting. Farmers fucked. You must be a 1 percenter. But even a lot of them didn't want the amount of money they got from the tax scam.

-Foundation shuttered for illegal personal & political gain.
-Base hates him for First Step & ban on bump stocks.
It was yesterday.
174 2018-12-19 23:13:08 I see that we've officially reached the "suggesting stocks can't go up in perpetuity is stupid" phase of the market cycle.
175 2018-12-19 23:12:49 Stocks only hope for a white knight was the #Fed NOT raising interest rates. Now—- look out below....

#MadTweets
176 2018-12-19 23:12:42 Jim, Companies had many chances to raise wages over past several years, and basically sat on hands. What they did is buyback stocks and make most of the things you buy less of a value, to increase margins. Those who were burned were the fixed income holders, now getting relief.
177 2018-12-19 23:12:19 many stocks with huge volume at the lows ........ rally tomorrow ?
178 2018-12-19 23:12:14 many stocks with huge volume at the lows ........ rally tomorrow ?
179 2018-12-19 23:12:10 he's been saying to get long the market for over a month. He got super long bank stocks two months ago and added all the way down. You should learn something about narcissistic doug kass. he's a liar and a crook.
180 2018-12-19 23:11:36 Nonsense.  Bumpstocks are neither bad nor good.  They are inanimate objects.  People are bad or good. People use bump stocks to do either bad/good.  There is no ban on an object that will change that.  Only a return to a more moral society will.  No government action can do this.
181 2018-12-19 23:11:18 to make people like you believe he's making money. For instance, he got super long bank stocks 3 months ago right at the peak and he's added all the way down. Show me on twitter where he's mentioned that? Crickets
182 2018-12-19 23:10:45 I <3 you this is good like legal weed stocks
183 2018-12-19 23:10:32 Why haven’t I seen anyone talk about how bump stocks were just banned? We’re finally getting legislation that’s needed man fhat makes me so happy
184 2018-12-19 23:10:13  no one cares about bump stocks. 

Even NRA is cool with this ban. 

Slippery slope argument is silly.
185 2018-12-19 23:10:08 You left out royalties. If we have to do the work now I want , stocks, bonds, or Drew M for a night or two.

187 2018-12-19 23:09:43 It is an infringement on the 2nd Ammendment to ban accessories like bump stocks, what next will be deemed not protected or necessary?
188 2018-12-19 23:09:07 Will this weekly expiry impact "long term investors" in nifty 50 stocks  or its just limited to intraday and swings trading volitility   @equitymrkt @contrarianEPS @unseenvalue @BalakrishnanR @WeekendInvestng @dmuthuk
189 2018-12-19 23:08:31 Both work equally as well. Once you’ve run true full auto there isn’t much thrill to a very labored process of fast fire with a bump stock. I won’t concede bump stocks fire full auto.  They don’t.
190 2018-12-19 23:08:21 I think they thought they were bum stocks and figured if they banned them then the market would go up
191 2018-12-19 23:08:07 would it have been that crazy to include stocks in WoL so you could at least make a team of the chars you collected.
Some of the stuff omitted really baffles me
192 2018-12-19 23:08:00 Bump stocks wouldn't matter if they just repealed the NFA.
193 2018-12-19 23:07:48 I don't think my stocks are ever actually going to go up
194 2018-12-19 23:07:02 That being said I did temporarily shift 20% from stocks to bonds. I'll shift it back after I have some tea and wait for this all to blow over.
195 2018-12-19 23:06:58 Then why support the ban miss NRA? Just one more encroachment on our 2nd Amendment rights as American citizens. Besides that though bump stocks are a waste of good ammo  #whatsnexttriggersquestionmark
196 2018-12-19 23:06:49 I figured it out, I was running it under all stocks, when I put U.S stocks i get now get 172. Thank you, and thanks for all your work you don't get nearly enough credit.
197 2018-12-19 23:06:46 The biggest problem we have is that assets have decoupled completely in price/value from underlying economy/incomes. And it's not just one or two asset categories, like tech in the dot-com days. It's everywhere - stocks, risky bonds, resi & comm. RE …
198 2018-12-19 23:05:53 The arguments around the efficiency of bump stocks really have nothing to do with banning it or not. Whatever being banned, full auto or SBR, is an infringement to the 2A, which is what we should focus on.
199 2018-12-19 23:05:47 #Liquidity is all that matters to stocks imho.
200 2018-12-19 23:05:44 I carried different firearms in the military and several different in 37 yrs as LEO. I can't see the purpose of bump-stocks for gun owners. The idea that a 7 pointer is going to run you down is not reason enough to warrant a bump-stock in your tree stand. One round works for most
201 2018-12-19 23:05:11 Well they finally did something to try to curtail mass murder-a tiny step of forbidding the use of bump stocks. Is the 2nd amendment ruined, broken or reversed? Did everyone's guns get confiscated or just disappear? Where do you see that slippery slope going now? Fear & loathing?
202 2018-12-19 23:04:58 I don't want to hear "but we are in a bear market" either. Crypto and stocks are down. $Tilray had good news today and is up $10.
203 2018-12-19 23:04:54 @realDonaldTrump so Guns and Bump Stocks are the problem Mr. President.  I guess we should put aTax Stamp on Guns you and ol Chuckie Boy could keep the Government running.  You folded on us Mr. President plain and SIMPLE!!!!
204 2018-12-19 23:03:48 pas de voiture, si vous allez chez leroy merlin et autres, n'ont plus de stocks style il vous y prendre 3 semaines à l'avance pour passer commande de matériel de base (tringle à rideaux, les vis qui vont avec sont en stock dans autre magasin, livrent pour très cher, etc etc .
205 2018-12-19 23:03:38 NOT sure how it works but I just declared war on Mexico, now I just have to find an army and some bump stocks any help would be appreciated !
206 2018-12-19 23:03:37 I’d like to say a big THANK YOU and job well done to @ChuckGrassley for helping pass comprehensive criminal justice reform and a ban on bump stocks. #gunsense
207 2018-12-19 23:03:29 If we’re focused on illegally banning bump stocks instead of improving school security measures, our priorities when it comes to preventing gun violence are a bit jaded #2A
208 2018-12-19 23:03:04 Some serious deflation is happening in the stock market, but news only talks about the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which only tells the story of the biggest companies.

I have a small portfolio, of 5 stocks.  In 2018, two of those stocks lost more than 90% of their value.
209 2018-12-19 23:02:51 @realDonaldTrump please stop the ATF from making a rule to make law abiding gun owners criminals. Banning bump stocks will not make us any safer. It just opens the window for the left to ban all other attachments to firearms. We voted for you to protect&defend the 2nd amendment!
210 2018-12-19 23:02:43 “Stocks go down faster than they go up but they go up more than they go down” - Cramer
211 2018-12-19 23:02:37 So Trump orders the DOJ to ban bump stocks (which is good) and Jarod Kushner is getting praise for brokering a bipartisan criminal reform bill. BUT, @realdonaldtrump now pulls out of Syria and eases sanctions on Russian oligarch - this is his MO people....don't fall for it!

213 2018-12-19 23:02:16 Gun nuts are going apeshit over the ban on bump stocks. Responsible gun owners recognize they have no place in the sport of shooting. The only thing they are good for is shooting into a crowd. Good riddance.

219 2018-12-19 23:01:02 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump  Highly disappointed in your decision to ban bump stocks . The bump stock did not commit any crime.. Put the blame where it belongs!

223 2018-12-19 22:59:12 Stocks trade on politics nowadays rather than fundamentals. He could have tremendous results and hold a crappy stock price if some libtard eff on CNBC says he doodled #MAGA on a legal pad in a meeting once
224 2018-12-19 22:59:08 Trump has flat lined the economy and tanked stocks. Maybe if you were a little more educated you would realize this. He put us trillions in debt and said he didn't care because he would be dead by the time the rest of us would have to pay for it.

234 2018-12-19 22:57:22 Agree.  But oil stocks are cheap now. Check out $XOM and $DNR .  2 stocks I use as a bell weather to gauge oil.
235 2018-12-19 22:57:02 I have to laugh.  Greedy corporations?   By nature and the law corporations make profits.  They are tools.  They are available to you. Just buy stocks.
But there is risk.  You may lose.
So if you play the lottery that makes you greedy? According to your thinking, yes it does.
236 2018-12-19 22:56:32 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President. I am 100% pro 2nd Amendment and I fully support your actions on bumpfire stocks.I feel devices that try to skirt existing laws does nothing but give ammo to those that seek to abolish the 2nd Amendment. Please look at "binary triggers" as well.
237 2018-12-19 22:55:57 They are different than having an automatic firearm. There is still one round fired for each trigger pull. I'm not championing them just making a point. A true automatic has better accuracy. Bump stocks jump around more..
238 2018-12-19 22:55:44 There is no Right To Bear Bump Stocks.

247 2018-12-19 22:52:23 Federal Reserve is doing what the Federal Reserve should be doing.

Interest rates will go up, real estate likely will go up some, stocks most likely will start to climb down or stabilize.

That’s just the way the game is played.
248 2018-12-19 22:52:14 Shocked that Trump caved and banned bump stocks. I’m sure he just lost a lot of supporters.
249 2018-12-19 22:52:13 It's fine when you play with an elite character, aside from the idiots who play with shit like 2 stocks 3 minutes. On non-elite yeah it sucks lol
250 2018-12-19 22:51:13 He just got eliminated while his opponents all have 3-2-2 stocks.
251 2018-12-19 22:51:05 I'd love to see normal exchanges do giveaways of mfst, aapl and other stocks for watching a few videos

I guess normal companies have shares which are actually worth something though
252 2018-12-19 22:50:53 Why did the stocks update for Apple remove the 10 year charts and also remove the ability for you to look at the charts landscape?
253 2018-12-19 22:50:32 I think there’s a few variables. Like your rank vs. theirs, how many stocks you lost, etc.
254 2018-12-19 22:50:22 Me: good lu- *sees my char start with -17 stocks. Opponent: good game
255 2018-12-19 22:50:19 Because the oil and gas industry does not want to lose money! Not to mention all the people involved or who own stocks in it! They pay big money and kill people who are a threat to there way of life! That simple! Thats why technology is suppressed in this country!
256 2018-12-19 22:49:53 #BumpStockBan DONE! 90 days to turn in bump stocks.  Thank you @realDonaldTrump another #PromisesKept Merry Christmas
257 2018-12-19 22:49:52 My job gives me stock options through my 401k... but im not too savvy with stocks and such ... I really want somebody to help me figure it out
258 2018-12-19 22:49:45 is there enough fuel (buyers) to lift stocks end of month?  not so sure.  dec monthly down 9.4% now.
259 2018-12-19 22:49:11 @realDonaldTrump is so fixated on re-election he will do anything for a positive headline. We won in Syria, see winning. Stocks heading south, debt fueled economy will be stagnating by 2020. Everyone calling his bluff from the wall to China.
260 2018-12-19 22:49:08 QE with $80B p.m to inflate the stocks during the past decade and now they want to suck $50B out p.m. You are lured into it by their pumping liquidity and now they are sucking up your money to leave you homeless and penniless. They want to keep the game going as long as it can.
261 2018-12-19 22:49:00 You mean #NostradumbAss stocks again, don't you?
262 2018-12-19 22:48:35 they are going for the low hanging fruit to make it look like they have done stuff... i believe most mass shootings did not involve bump stocks... but i am glad they are being banned... 
263 2018-12-19 22:48:25 The most tilting thing to come across in Quick Play isn't someone who plays with 2 stocks. 

It's someone who has fucking default Spirit Train and 3D Land in their stagelist 
264 2018-12-19 22:48:14 I need my paltry holdings of penny stocks to go up 10,000 percent and fast if I am to retire within the next 30 years.
265 2018-12-19 22:48:04 Five stocks drove SPY higher for months/years, what about other 495? The market is not balanced from the start. Cough...
266 2018-12-19 22:47:39 Seriously?! All I've heard coming out of the 2009 crisis has been about impending doom caused by loose monetary policy. Maybe we follow different sources. I've been hearing crash calls for stocks the entire rise up to the top.
267 2018-12-19 22:47:35 As long as they can rig bonds, gold, oil & stocks why worry. Just make it up as you HFT down the trail to Hell.
268 2018-12-19 22:47:21 I still believe that stocks have one more major rally that will suck retail in for one final smashdown.
269 2018-12-19 22:47:07 And now bump stocks are made illegal country-wide... People need to wake up and stop letting this shit happen, before they have nothing to left to defend themselves with
270 2018-12-19 22:47:05 So they went to zero rates in order to maintain stability, and they traded cash for bonds via QE. People were concerned about this causing inflation, but largely we've seen asset price inflation (mainly stocks and housing), but
271 2018-12-19 22:46:59 You would be proud of me Wes, I've owned several cannabis stocks since 2013!
272 2018-12-19 22:46:55 You're prolife but upset bump stocks were banned? That's an interesting stance.
273 2018-12-19 22:46:46 But let's just use some logic here. Bump stocks should never have been legal in the first place. They have no bearing on our first amendment rights. IMHO, it's a good decision. Let's all hope the mass shootings, for whatever reason, go away for good. I think we can agree on that.
274 2018-12-19 22:46:24 Yes it is your constitutional right to bear arms. We all get that. Banning bump stocks is not taking away your constitutional rights. It is taking away a accessory to a gun which makes it more deadly. No one is taking away your AR15.
275 2018-12-19 22:46:19 Recent MAGA:

— apparent cave on the wall
— executive ban on bump stocks
— insta-withdrawal from Syria

By the end of the week, every wing of the party will be pissed off one way or another

277 2018-12-19 22:46:01 BAN Bump Stocks... Absolutely.
278 2018-12-19 22:46:00 I don’t own one but this is crap if it succeeds we all know it won’t stop at bump stocks. It never does this will open doors no one has
279 2018-12-19 22:45:57 I was getting at people who purchased a bunch of bump stocks after the Vegas shooting in the hopes to get rich selling them after a manufacturing ban.  It was like they were Beanie Babies for gun enthusiasts.

281 2018-12-19 22:44:48 @SarahKSilverman Have you noticed the Stocks have plunged lower than the necklines of hookers trump has dated, since he took office?
282 2018-12-19 22:44:23 Full auto weapons made after 1986 are illegal for private citizens.
A private citizen can own one made before 1986 but it’s a tedious and expensive process.
Bump stocks were created in 2010 by a AF veteran who wanted a cheaper option to shoot more bullets
283 2018-12-19 22:44:10 Hi Anjum, thanks for getting in touch with us. I have found a range of different products which would be suitable for you. Can you please DM me with your local store and I can check stocks of selected products for you? Many thanks - Noor
284 2018-12-19 22:43:56 i wonder if @COSMICCDINO cleansed me because i’m on the phone selling stocks and i don’t know how i got here. lmao
285 2018-12-19 22:43:32 Oh my goodness, really? But y’know, if I was President Obama, banning bump stocks would be something I’d happily own as a legacy!
286 2018-12-19 22:43:19 Anybody..??   #ARS was the drop today just because @SharePickers said he had sold all resource stocks today, really ?? fooking sheeple if so..
287 2018-12-19 22:43:05 The private "Federal Reserve" bankers get out before it tanks, buy when there is blood in the streets.  And invest in military stocks when the inevitable war pulls economies out of depression. They have it all going on.  Oh to be a cabal banker..
288 2018-12-19 22:42:53 I was looking into this and all reports that I have read say that the LV shooted had bump stocks, but the reports didn't say they were actually used.
But like Jeeper said, this will not stop future mass shootings when most of them use hand guns.
289 2018-12-19 22:42:37 Bump stocks are not the problem.
290 2018-12-19 22:42:21 First Tim over trading went from green to red to Green to red lol breaking rules GREED set in and FOMO. Small loss #stocks
291 2018-12-19 22:42:00 No bump stocks and no wall make trump base persnickety
292 2018-12-19 22:42:00 Trump should have not signed the band on bump stocks he will lose in 2020. He lied to the American people and said he would uphold the Constitution.This is not good.
293 2018-12-19 22:41:36 Trump feeling the heat of mueller case so mans pulls troops outta Syria and gets bump stocks banned for good press lol. Can’t lie he know how to move when the pressure on sometimes
294 2018-12-19 22:41:21 @NRA Big Loss today regarding bump stocks.  Once my membership runs out I’ll be backing @GunOwners  from now on.  Advice: 1) Don’t continue asking for money if you’re not producing results 2) keep your crappy gifts for donating money.  Use contributions for deregulating gun laws.
295 2018-12-19 22:41:19 Coming up on #OEN  search for a suspect in deadly shooting of #Orlando high school student continues, husband of woman found dead in Orange County this morning in custody, #POTUS pulling troops from #Syria CR saves shutdown Terry Moore from Capitol Hill, stocks slide on #WallSt

297 2018-12-19 22:39:32 Just want to say to every one who is following me, happy holidays and a happy new year. And most of all, good luck with the stocks.
298 2018-12-19 22:39:26 Apparently it's easier to change the definition of a machine gun. Deciding bump-fire stocks are machine guns is nuts. So is banning them because one guy used one to commit murder.
299 2018-12-19 22:39:02 Well, multinationals are owned by shareholders like smaller companies are, & individual property rights mean those investors should have freedom to make a profit within the law. Anyone can buy shares/stocks if they want to. If govt gets out of the way, free markets work it out.
300 2018-12-19 22:38:53 Bair is his only reliable kill option that isn't a smash attack past 150 percent. It's insanely hard to secure stocks. He can build up damage but can't actually do anything beyond that.
301 2018-12-19 22:38:26 Hey man, what are you thinking?  Withdraw from Syria?  Ban bump stocks?  You are loosing your base;  You are loosing me.  
302 2018-12-19 22:38:22 Long some things, short more things. I'm long staples (which have gotten wrecked with everything else), but short $SPY and momentum-tech stocks. I'm hugely green overall, despite losing a lot on XLP. I reduced my position before the Fed, thankfully.
303 2018-12-19 22:38:12 He crashed everyone’s retirement in an hour. No one should have that much power. They push everyone into 401ks and with no warning crash them. You can’t sell them on a whim like stocks. Horrendous scary day.
304 2018-12-19 22:37:36 But how much would a bump stock ban affect America's broader gun violence? "Virtually not at all...I don't know that bump stocks have ever been used in a gun crime before (Las Vegas).”
305 2018-12-19 22:37:17 Bump stocks are not necessary for you to exercise your 2nd amendment rights....give me a good circumstance for bump stock...other then its fun an cool....
306 2018-12-19 22:37:16 The two people who have been the most wrong about the market (and lost you the most money if you followed their advice) on @CNBC @CNBCFastMoney about the market this year have been:

1. Tony Dwyer @dwyerstrategy
2. Tom Lee @fundstrat
#StockMarket #stockmarketcrash #stocks #nyse
307 2018-12-19 22:36:53 So, people that call for a bump stock ban don’t actually know what bump stocks are, even though (according to you) bump stocks are so simple that they are a practical and legal equivalent to a rubber band?
308 2018-12-19 22:36:47 And if you bought bank stocks in early 2016. It’s almost buy opportunity boys!
309 2018-12-19 22:36:32 These slobby gobshites should be clapped in stocks and pelted with the veg that has been left to rot in the fields because thanks to them there’s no longer any seasonal EU workers to harvest them.
310 2018-12-19 22:36:27 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks tumble to 2018 lows after Fed raises rates.
311 2018-12-19 22:36:14 People keep randomly giving me game on stocks I think that’s a sign
312 2018-12-19 22:36:05 Down 50% since October 2018. 70% NVDA, 30% FNGU. Down 40% since I started messing with stocks last year lol.
313 2018-12-19 22:35:37 Credit where credit is due, Trump banning bump stocks and pulling out of Syria are two really good things.
314 2018-12-19 22:35:34 60 percent of S&P 500 stocks closed in bear market territory today.

That’s exactly 300 stocks down at least 20% from highs w companies like $GE $FB, $AAPL, $MU, $NVDA pps down 60.5%, 39%, 31.1%, 51.4%, and 52.7% respectively.
315 2018-12-19 22:35:13 All my students are talking about investing in stocks and I can't even justify investing in a mcdouble after school.
316 2018-12-19 22:35:05 Oh one more thing on the gun rights. The president signed to ban bump stocks. Something that I’m actually shocked by. Already seeing some of his base turning on him for doing that.
317 2018-12-19 22:34:52 The only thing you need to know about bump-stocks is, it's a gimmicky modification designed to skirt the letter of the law while violating the spirit of the law.
318 2018-12-19 22:34:40 Bump stocks are a technology loophole around the long-standing ban on full auto, that we have lived with for decades.  I am a die hard 2A supporter and AR owner (Windham Weaponry - great gun!) and I support the ban.  @mchooyah is 100% right.
319 2018-12-19 22:34:33 Last year I sponsored a bill to ban bump stocks in LA.  All of the NRA enthusiasts were there to fight against the bill. It was a good bill and LA would have led the charge on this one. Well glad they are now banned.
320 2018-12-19 22:34:28 Lol. Obama was still claiming his economy a month ago. So over night it went to crap? Just because the stock market is down now does not mean the economy is bad. When stocks were good. @CNN said stocks were separate from the economy. Just trying to keep up with the negative spin.
321 2018-12-19 22:34:27 My point isn't about whether they ought to be banned, but the method. If the law doesn't cover bump stocks, change the law.

329 2018-12-19 22:32:08 This is possible, but not yet.

And yes, look at the returns of TLT etc when bonds rallied.

Best thing to hold onto next crisis, then look at redeploying capital and buying up dirt cheap stocks.
330 2018-12-19 22:31:52 @realDonaldTrump thanks for banning bump stocks; are there any other rights you want to infringe on during your term in office?  Yeah, probably won’t be voting for you again. TYRANT!
331 2018-12-19 22:31:31 Someone needs to invent virtual stocks!
332 2018-12-19 22:31:03 No Wall, ban on bump stocks. Your base is becoming very disappointed in you Mr. President. You have had a Republican House and Senate for two years and all you have done is pass a previous bloated budget. You have let Rhino’s into your inner circle that giving you bad advice.
333 2018-12-19 22:30:04 It's the first step towards more. If you have not figured out if they take an inch today, they'll take a mile tomorrow then you need to wake up!

"But Bump Stocks are just an accessory."

If they ban scopes, will you be ok with that?
A 30 round magazine for an AR is STANDARD yet
334 2018-12-19 22:29:17 Bump stocks.The AR is not made to fire rounds that fast,after 2 or 3 magazines that AR will misfire,jam,then melt,in that order.
They have been around awhile now,and not popular for reasons stated above.Besides the AR-15 is a piece of junk.
335 2018-12-19 22:29:13 Just imagine the response if a President @HillaryClinton had banned bump stocks, pulled out of Syria, removed sanctions against a Russian gangster, tanked the stock market because of her economic policies, and had a judge disband The @ClintonFdn all in a week's time?
336 2018-12-19 22:29:01 This indeed looks to be what's happening currently. Stocks get hit to keep the game playing just that bit longer, going to end badly  The problem is it may never be in our lifetimes 
337 2018-12-19 22:28:57 Including my bump stocks
338 2018-12-19 22:28:54 Not fully. Though was beyond the hike. Market expected an ultra dovish hike. Got a partially dovish hike. Couple that with stocks +1.5% in day prior to the statement, making them vulnerable, and with the generalized bearish environment. Then came the BS comments. A policy error.
339 2018-12-19 22:28:48 And no "bump stocks" which is the first tiny step towards disarmament and becoming a communist shithole like the unelected #EU
340 2018-12-19 22:28:41 Bump stocks have only ever been used to massacre people never to defend anything or kill more deer/birds.  #TerroristNRA
341 2018-12-19 22:28:19 Interest rate rise gave a nice little S&P pop, then continued moving in its most recent trend $spy #markets #equities #stocks
342 2018-12-19 22:27:58 I personally think bump stocks are useless novelty items. It’s the principle of the matter is why I’m pissed with the ban and trump caving on it
343 2018-12-19 22:27:47 Yay for central bank independence - a critical message for the world. Boo for stocks. We'll all be retiring super old! A small price to pay.
344 2018-12-19 22:27:26 This seems so pointless. Who really cares about bump stocks. The “ this is only the first step to full 2a repeal” is dumb
345 2018-12-19 22:26:53 ...and while you may be able to catch bullets in your teeth, no way most people could defend themselves from a sniper on the 36th floor of Mandalay Bay with multiple military assault weapons, bump stocks and thousands of rounds of ammo. /Delete Guns, /Delete Gun Problems.
346 2018-12-19 22:26:49 Roughly 52% of Americans own stocks. Down from around 66% in 2007. And those tax cuts earlier resulted in a stock buyback of over $1 trillion. Companies are not investing in workers. Not raising salaries. Not providing health care. Not paying taxes. They are lining their pockets
347 2018-12-19 22:26:27 If i remember correctly stocks also make you a partial owner of the company??? I don't really know how that works but that might also be a factor
348 2018-12-19 22:25:21 I still won the set so I'm satisfied. I sacrificed my stocks to nerf Luigi.
349 2018-12-19 22:24:55 Surely there must be at least some connection between stocks and the economy that generates the earnings?
350 2018-12-19 22:24:46 as did I, I'm not a gun control person, have done extensive research on real reasons behind gun violence.  But bump stocks are a "toy" we can do without and not fear giving up anything.
351 2018-12-19 22:24:31 @Richzeoli So, did @POTUS pass prison reform so they could make bed space for the people with bump stocks? @GREGSTOCKER
352 2018-12-19 22:23:50 M1 finance is hands down best app to trade stocks
353 2018-12-19 22:23:36 100% correct. Besides bump stocks are pointless. Trump just knocked off a liberal talking point.
354 2018-12-19 22:23:18 My point was that military roles would pick automatic over bump stocks if they have the choice. You're supposed to be able to form a viable militia, suppression is an important role in urban warfare
355 2018-12-19 22:22:53 My concerns have less to do with the utility of bump stocks and more to do with with the executive and DOJ creating law--whether Trump or Obama.  Congress legislates.  The executive enforces.  

This sort of nonsense empowers a future Dem POTUS to have DOJ bypass Congress.

.
356 2018-12-19 22:22:53 Ah, the part of the constitution regarding bump stocks is my fav...
357 2018-12-19 22:22:51 Just spit balling here but could the decline in the Dow be closely related to tax cuts for the rich , maybe the middle class is cashing their stocks in to stay above water and survive in the face of higher taxes to them
358 2018-12-19 22:22:47 This is an absurd take.  Bump stocks aren’t guns.  They turn a legal weapon into something far more dangerous.  I think this was the right call.
359 2018-12-19 22:22:37 #FederalReserve Powell Thank you for raising interest rates... I was able to pickup stocks on sale this afternoon... Christmas came earlier for me!
360 2018-12-19 22:22:02 Stocks, Gold, and $VIX $VXX all down today. Thursday and Friday will be ugly.
361 2018-12-19 22:21:50 Also under @realDonaldTrump no more bump stocks, I presume he's not going for reelection
362 2018-12-19 22:21:10 I have seen a lot of people say the say the wall is huge!!  I’ll vote him but the wall and bump stocks ehh - I Love first step act
363 2018-12-19 22:20:56 "YOU" didn't accomplish a thing. Ignorance of the mechanics of 'bump stocks' gives you a hollow piece of legislation. You can literally create a "bump-stock" effect with a rubber band, if you know what you're doing. So...gonna ban rubber bands? Or fingers?
364 2018-12-19 22:20:50 Unlike stocks markets which have a daily closing time, crypto is 24/7 so it's very arbitrary to have a daily candle at 00:00GMT
Today a daily close at 1pm would give a very different candle despite orders/trades/PA which is the data we should conclusions from, being the same, no?
365 2018-12-19 22:20:33 Another change is that there were a lot of individual stocks with high volume. Wasn't the same across the board. So probably real people selling vs just indexers
366 2018-12-19 22:20:14 Ima buy some stocks in Primerica bc clearly they’re hustling acting like human spam on my ig
367 2018-12-19 22:19:54 By the way, if you stocked up on bump stocks, the President just declared you a criminal.

Congratulations.
368 2018-12-19 22:19:15 1. Nice Congress bipartisan work putting this Criminal Justice Reform Bill together...don't screw it up! 
2. Kudos on the 'bump stocks ban' ruling as well. 
3. Ordering US troops to leave Syria and declaring victory over ISIS there...WTF?!
369 2018-12-19 22:19:12 Can we have a moment of silence for all the cranks who were warning of the portfolio devastation cause bonds and stocks were positively correlated for a little while?
370 2018-12-19 22:19:09 @TDAmeritrade I bought some stocks. It said the stocks were pending, now they are expired. I have $50 in my Ameritrade account and it is telling me I don’t have enough money to buy stocks
371 2018-12-19 22:18:27 #StockMarket The Fed raised rates & cut its outlook for U.S. economy. So, it's no surprise that stocks continue to plunge. @realDonaldTrump is about to give us a December stock market to remember. It really would be great if his 16 day vacation turned into a permanent leave. 
372 2018-12-19 22:18:16 I will always be amazed by how selfish the FED is. Imo ppl voted Trump thinking he will stimulate the economy blabla. The dow just closed at the 2018 low (erase all 2018 gains). Those same ppl are the one who bought all the stocks for a good profit in 2018. I guess you screwed
373 2018-12-19 22:18:02 Not heard today- but the discount rate going lower makes stocks cheaper...:)
374 2018-12-19 22:17:49 What do you mean you have to have 25k to hit that move? You mean to trade NFLX because the price of the stock?!?!?! Thats the power of options!! The options were only like $2 or $3 bucks man! Options allow u to play these stocks for pennies on the dollars basically Look into it!!
375 2018-12-19 22:17:39 My first act as president will be to dissolve the ATF as a federal agency and open it up as a franchise where you can buy all the stuff the government has tried to ban. Drive through bump stocks and SBRs anyone?
376 2018-12-19 22:17:34 Maybe the Americans need to drop their banned bump stocks at the border and miraculously they will be provided asylum and benefits!!
How dumb can we be? when will the right wingers start pouring into the streets protesting against injustice?
377 2018-12-19 22:17:21 Is anyone on the TL into buying and selling stocks? Long term investments or day trading? I’m trynna learn somethin
378 2018-12-19 22:17:11 This was thought out.  Bump stocks are, as had been said, novelty items.  Minimum impact to the industry and still gives some bait for the moderates who are now thinking'
379 2018-12-19 22:16:51 He just did.

He illegally banned bump stocks by regulation.
380 2018-12-19 22:15:51 Did this idiot Najariian on @CNBC  just really say that computer algorithms send stocks lower faster than upside w/ certain words? Anyone with $ invested in this clown-take it out!
381 2018-12-19 22:15:50 Fed is out to destroy the one thing Trump had going. I.e., Stock prices.  And they are succeeding. Take stocks down and Trump with his wall betrayal has NOTHING.
382 2018-12-19 22:15:49 Dear Mohnish Sir please provide the same for Indian stocks too.
383 2018-12-19 22:15:36 Stocks/ Portfolio up 8.46%

Im ready to get back in
#ALLIN
384 2018-12-19 22:15:01 But in this case, the ban has made the weapon more dangerous for everyone around it. More regulations lead to more people bypassing it and every time it adds more danger. Bump stocks don't really serve a militia's needs but automatic weapons do. Shouldn't that be argument enough
385 2018-12-19 22:14:52 You can do what you choose and people who want bump stocks are free to own them. Nobody cares about what politicians say anymore.
386 2018-12-19 22:14:51 The World of the boss! @federalreserve worked done. American stocks fall deeply.
387 2018-12-19 22:14:25 What do you mean by short term greed? Lots of channels (discount rate, real economy, margin loans, corporate leverage, sentiment) for higher rates to hit stocks, but what is the role of short termism or greed?
388 2018-12-19 22:14:23 Question is value of stocks, if the PE is still strong - then what’s the issue? If PEs are all massively high of course we need a further correction. A PE of more than 20 is high as it would represent 5% interest on debt free basis.
389 2018-12-19 22:13:59 #stocks checking some individual stocks & carnange $vktx #banks $cgc $gbt $roku just to name a few. Many stocks off 50,60,70% +
390 2018-12-19 22:13:38 The libs don't care about bump stocks. They only care they diminished the 2nd Amendment once more. Next they are coming for factory capacity magazines.

Only pushback was against New York's "arbitrary" 7 round limit; apparently 10 rounds is the magic number and is constitutional.
391 2018-12-19 22:13:09 Conservatives don't give a damn about the military, except to use as political and human pawns

They push for privatization because they can't profit off of the VA like they can holding stocks in private business, and getting donations + kickbacks from corporations
392 2018-12-19 22:12:53 What could it be? Don’t get it, MNKD selling common shares and warrants to buy common stocks. Please help here.
393 2018-12-19 22:12:51 Bump stocks are for shooting the silhouettes of targets anyways inaccurate af.
394 2018-12-19 22:12:50 Bump stocks are nothing more than a  fast way to waste money on ammo and after one use most of them probably end up at the bottom of the gun safe but I don't like to be governed by a pen and a phone pass a law if you want to outlaw them
395 2018-12-19 22:12:13 Stocks up ~28% since Trump said we are in a big fat bubble. So there’s that...
396 2018-12-19 22:11:52 He did it to change the subject and press narrative, and appease his base who have to give up their bump stocks now. And btw, it'll never happen.
397 2018-12-19 22:11:33 yes Kyle ,you buy up your company's stock if the price is underrated . How does that hurt you? just stop buying over priced stocks, Kyle.
398 2018-12-19 22:11:19 I love guns, paid for professional training, shoot regularly at a tactical range and live in Texas. But I've always thought bump stocks went over the line in both safety and intent of the ATF regs on full auto. I don't see a slippery slope here. I do in other stuff but not this.
399 2018-12-19 22:11:10 What happened to “only 50% of people own stocks” lol...I get it, believe me, my wife’s 401k balance is still 10% higher, balance being the key word...
400 2018-12-19 22:11:07 Yeah it’s literally retarded also with all the new “pistol” stocks and blades they might as well be stocks.
401 2018-12-19 22:10:52 I have lost a ton of stocks as Marth to this.  Which is a reason why I’m not playing Marth anymore. Lol

403 2018-12-19 22:10:37 Focusing on bump stocks and not getting to the bottom of the Las Vegas attack, irrespective of your view on guns, is like someone pointing to the moon and you focusing on the finger.
404 2018-12-19 22:10:31 Settle down. You don’t need bump stocks.
405 2018-12-19 22:10:09 You’re being blocked. Your account is making me go long stocks
406 2018-12-19 22:09:51 Banning bump stocks is unconstitutional
407 2018-12-19 22:09:43 É um fucking loan feito por uma empresa, em x de pedir um empréstimo ou emitir stocks boiiiiiiiii
408 2018-12-19 22:09:18 Hey you got something, You got those evil bump stocks. 
409 2018-12-19 22:09:16 If they pass a law saying you can’t sell a firearm or making bump stocks illegal to own that’s how if you sell it without registering it with the authority you are breaking the law they might even charge you as an accomplice or aiding in the crime
410 2018-12-19 22:09:14 I just think that globally we've been in a bear market, many stocks down 25-40% already but SPX only down 10% and I think it could catch down unless FED manages a slower cooling off.
411 2018-12-19 22:08:48 bump stocks!!!!! are banned now!!!!!! we did it kids!!!!!! go young people!!!!!
412 2018-12-19 22:08:43 Next trend will be towards rules-based funds that exclude crappiest percentiles of stocks.
413 2018-12-19 22:08:29 Stocks trades are mostly algorithmic. Everything will fall initially, but defensive stocks like utilities, home necessities etc tend to do better. You may not buy a new Iphone, but you will still need heat, electricity, and food.

415 2018-12-19 22:08:22 Market Close: MBS +13bps; DOW -351.98; NASDAQ -147.08; S&P 500 -39.20; 10yr Treasury 2.76%;  Stocks & Yields retreat after FOMC Announcement, as they indicate continued gradual rate increases in 2019.
416 2018-12-19 22:08:12 Random now gives you a random number of stocks, but it can't go over whatever the set stock is
417 2018-12-19 22:07:50 Anyone sharing charts at the moment and saying something like "whoah, what a downtrend! Poor stoopid bagholders lolz" is an absolute moron. 

90% of stocks have been slammed over the past few months. You are not Einstein for pointing out stocks feeling the wrath of the market.
418 2018-12-19 22:07:37 $ZN $SSTI $FPI $CDZI $PTE $RDVT $FTK $GTS $TRTC $TAL Just a few stocks that didn't get murdered today. Must have something in common.
419 2018-12-19 22:07:19 You are just a passionate guy, Jim. Whether it’s about stocks, your sweet family, the Eagles, gardening whatever! It’s why I watched you for years!
420 2018-12-19 22:06:58 There is no right saying you can own whatever you want, nor is there a right to own bump stocks.
421 2018-12-19 22:06:29 Dont you have some stocks to sell?
422 2018-12-19 22:06:25 I'm a member, but bump stocks are bs "accessories", which only serve to make an end run around the law...
423 2018-12-19 22:06:15 Lets take a close look here at what has happened in the past 72 hours.

1.) 4,000 Criminals will be released from prison

2.)  Bump Stocks Banned by executive order.

3.) No Border Wall Funding, Yet more than was requested goes to central America.
#TheFive #TheWall
424 2018-12-19 22:05:32 Exactly. Stocks in correction but people claim “crash!”
425 2018-12-19 22:05:27 Yah, before leaving for home, saw an 800pt swing - and not the good kind. Could say surprised at the reaction, but maybe this was in the cards. Would not have thought #Normalization such a harsh mistress but we are still far above 2015-16 levels. Agree on forced into stocks tho
426 2018-12-19 22:05:09 Ugh. My money is pretty tied up in other stocks right now and things aren't looking good for the stock market at the mo. There HAS GOT to be other avenues to explore. 
427 2018-12-19 22:05:09 Hey folks! 
Think about it.........
Criminal justice reform.
Pulling out of Syria.
Screw the wall.
Bump stocks banned.
ALL IN 24 HOURS.
IS. HE. RESIGNING?
428 2018-12-19 22:05:05 How many bump-stocks have been known to be used in a crime? 1
429 2018-12-19 22:04:54 I don't give a shit either way, bump stocks were a shitty gimmicky accessory. I just dont like the fact that a win in the gun control column for them and they'll run with it. What's next? Rubber bands? Less glamorous but same effect.
430 2018-12-19 22:04:21 Well I gotta say it, @realDonaldTrump did a REALLY good thing by banning bump-stocks. I will always praise good deeds as well as tear down bad deeds, no matter WHO it is. Thank you!
431 2018-12-19 22:04:21 Not voting at all .reciprocity, hearing protection act , bump stocks
432 2018-12-19 22:04:09 We're all doomed. She'll be murdering people left and right when food stocks really dwindle 
433 2018-12-19 22:03:52 I see conservatives getting mad over this bump stock ban... but can anyone tell me why we actually should have bump stocks; what practical purpose do they ever serve... will it stop shootings? Of course not, if we want to that then we should address mental health issues...but...
434 2018-12-19 22:03:39 Too many stocks to choice imho better play $xbi Call options
435 2018-12-19 22:03:35 $DLTR (+64 percent), $AMGN (+23.9 percent) and $WMT(+19.5 percent) we’re the top 3 S&P 500 stocks in 2008. I would think $WM might do ok in a recession also
436 2018-12-19 22:03:20 With that being said this original tweet was about “bump stocks” in my opinion they are a novelty anyway, and agree on them not being good for much.
437 2018-12-19 22:03:14 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-12-19, is 327.4591. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
438 2018-12-19 22:03:01 Bump stocks
439 2018-12-19 22:02:30 Any of these things (fiat currency, stocks, crypto) are as trustworthy as people believe them to be. They aren't actually any more or less stable than each other. Unlike fiat currency, crypto has international support, so one country's economy can't make it worthless.
440 2018-12-19 22:02:27 That's my argument. I'm probably fun as hell but bump stocks are loop hole to have something close to full auto. We should be all for closing these loop holes but nooo. "Muh bump stock" like if you need a bump stock to shoot fast then you need some finger training
441 2018-12-19 22:02:27 @M1_Finance Honest Review is rendering right now. Has to be the most requested video I've had so far. Will it beat at the 150k views my @acorns Honest Review has? #investing #stocks #StockMarket
442 2018-12-19 22:02:19 Oh ja, ook gehoord vanavond, die Amerikaanse 'bump stocks' worden NIET verboden, enkel de naam! #hetismaardatjehetweet
443 2018-12-19 22:02:14 So Trump seems to be doing several things I agree with.

withdrawing from Syria (chaotic/impulsive, sure, but why stay if no strategy?)

Banning bump stocks (low hanging fruit but credit when due)

Criminal justice reform (small step, but any movement on this at fed lvl is good)
444 2018-12-19 22:01:57 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-12-19, is 332.97. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk

447 2018-12-19 22:01:42 Talked to some impressive young men about investing yesterday. They were all in the 23-28 year age range. The most important lesson for them? Time is on your side! Invest early, invest often, invest regularly...and the whole world will be your oyster. #stocks
448 2018-12-19 22:01:32 The Fed deserves to be trashed. In fact the organization should be dissolved! They are too political and have the power to manipulate currency and stocks! Why were interest rates kept at or near “0” with BHO, yet DJT grows the economy and is punished?!
449 2018-12-19 22:00:58 Checking in with the #CNBC ghouls to gauge their #Fed spin and look who it is: David Kelly of #JPMorgan ! In early 2008 just before the crash, when home prices were at peak madness, he spoke at a Boston luncheon, advised investors stocks looked great. Same today #DejaVu

455 2018-12-19 22:00:08 Tell me what about banning bumps stocks is not Rino. That’s about as Rino as you can get. How as a Republican do you screw anything related to guns up?
456 2018-12-19 21:59:30 Chris Cox is a traitor, telling people to support risk protection orders and signed off on the banning of bump stocks. You called for the regulation of bump stocks after Vegas then yesterday release a statement saying “wow were disappointed by this”. Must think we’re all stupid.
457 2018-12-19 21:59:06 Yeah honestly only the rich have a bunch of stocks that count as "wealth", anyone irl I know that has stocks uses them as a way to make money by buying in when the stocks are low, and pulling out when they go up enough to have made a profit
458 2018-12-19 21:58:49 If bump stocks are the worst he ever does...it’s a good presidency.
459 2018-12-19 21:58:45 Not only that, through various shady trades and his shuffling of some stocks and bonds being funneled through an anonymous firm, he stands to make enough that if you’re still reading this and haven’t figured out that I don’t know what I’m talking about then I got you.
460 2018-12-19 21:58:32 Well we did lose on border wall funding.
Bump stocks.
10 billion in aid to S America. 
A win would be nice.
BUT...
He is all alone in washington.
I'm not mad at him over these losses.
But we will be demonized no matter what we do so we may as well get our shit done anyway.
461 2018-12-19 21:58:17 You got nothing banned. Trump banned bump-stocks and you had nothing to do with it. Dummy.
462 2018-12-19 21:58:13 Honestly @WillieDelwiche it would be so sweet after allllllll these people sold stocks cuz housing slowed cuz that (always?) forecasts a recession
463 2018-12-19 21:58:10 @GuyAdami  man you are awful. The S&P is down only 13%. Most stocks are down 30-50%. How did you get this job?? Are you even paid? I guess you like seeing the American people and the economy crumble. Don’t worry, maybe I’ll hire you when I’m working at Starbucks.
464 2018-12-19 21:58:05 There was an episode where everybody gets rich on the stock market, but zoidberg trades his shares for a sandwich, then when the stocks go bust, he gloats about his sandwich heavy portfolio.
465 2018-12-19 21:57:53 These elitists know what they're doing.  They orchestrate crashes in order to reduce the prices of company stocks so they can buy up (i.e. monopolize) as much of the markets as they can.  Shareholding must be abolished and Social Security For All should be instituted.
466 2018-12-19 21:57:47 Both bonds and stocks closed through key levels.  Market clearly thinks this is a policy mistake.
467 2018-12-19 21:57:24 Marc don't worry about it. Stocks are on sale right  now but if this volatility is bothering you that much you probably have more stock allocation than you need.
468 2018-12-19 21:57:22 Pick handful stocks n get to know them like your best friends. Pre market study news etc and follow the money n sentiment
469 2018-12-19 21:57:21 They are not taking any guns away it’s just bump stocks which turn a semi auto rifle into a full auto basically
470 2018-12-19 21:57:05 I dont know if we've hit bottom or not but its hilarious to see Doug kass, who was screaming to get super long stock 1000 dow points ago, act like he's just now getting long. He's been super long Banks stocks for 3 months and added all the way down. And he doesn't even mention it
471 2018-12-19 21:56:52 Ini zvema stocks and commodities ndizvo zvinhu zvandakatadza kuhwisisa ini. 
472 2018-12-19 21:55:57 May I suggest that if the Fed left rates unchanged that stocks may have done much worse as fears about the economy would have been stoked.
473 2018-12-19 21:55:53 A bump stock's purpose is to make a non NFA weapon operate as an NFA weapon.  It's illegal to manufacture fully automatic weapons.  This isn't a change to a law, it's a regulation that recognizes that bump stocks convert semi-auto weapons to fully automatic, which is illegal.
474 2018-12-19 21:55:34 Stock market drops = crypto market drops faster. Money from stocks will not flow into an even more volatile and risky asset class. People will be looking for safe havens.
475 2018-12-19 21:55:27 #stocks I laugh when I hear we’re in a correction on @CNBC   Majority of S&P is in bear Mkt territory.  We’re in bear Mkt territory. It’s ok to say
476 2018-12-19 21:55:16 NRA was always against bump stocks.  ATF cleared the sale of bump stocks.
477 2018-12-19 21:55:02 While I have been following you for about a month, I am trying to see if you have advice for the individual, small potatoes investor like me. Are you stating because of this bubble, now is the time to shift portfolio out of stocks to cash? or some ratio?
478 2018-12-19 21:54:35 Aren't bump stocks just the product of another level of prohibition? (Converting weapons to act as automatic because they're banned or something)
479 2018-12-19 21:54:14 There really is a subsection of twitter for everything. Just found one for old people who trade stocks
480 2018-12-19 21:54:11 We got bump-stocks banned!!!

Shout out to all the amazing @AMarch4OurLives chapters that got people to comment on ATFs website to ban bump-stocks.
481 2018-12-19 21:54:01 @realDonaldTrump  You unconstitutionally ban bump stocks while letting criminals out of prison? Great! Now they can hobnob with all of the illegal aliens that your administration is letting in every single day! They can all live together with the other 20M here illegally! Great!
482 2018-12-19 21:53:35 $WSTL isn't a run-rate "earnings" or "EBITDA" -based buy. It's "revenue based"-  a company with >40% GMs that a strategic could buy and instantly eliminate >$4M in standalone costs & boom! I've made all my money on stocks like this... then lost almost 1/3 of it short $TSLA, lol
483 2018-12-19 21:53:21 I own stocks
484 2018-12-19 21:53:04 Nope. Mais faut que je refasse les stocks de cochonnaille parfois
485 2018-12-19 21:52:57 Love to see an update on how many bump stocks are surrendered to the government
486 2018-12-19 21:51:49 Because bump stocks are for idiots and we're glad they're banned.

Besides. We'll just unban them later and take this small victory from the Demonrats
487 2018-12-19 21:51:36 Bump stocks are only good for fun at a range and for one other thing... no reasonable person would use one as self defense, especially in a home.
488 2018-12-19 21:51:16 Is the fed supposed to stop making the same mistakes and stop scaring everyone and not really looking at the stocks just talk smh
489 2018-12-19 21:50:53 Billionaires who took Trump's tax breaks (many did not personally like him, & did not vote for him) are selling stocks. It's the suckers on Main Street in towns across the Midwest who voted for Trump who will hold on & see their 401k's cut in half in the coming Trump depression.
490 2018-12-19 21:50:20 You’re right it isn’t the economy. But the companies whose stocks trade on it are large part of the economy. Interest rates rising indicate slower growth. Housing starts are now more costly. Acquisitions more costly. Development more costly. Borrowing more costly. Profits down.
491 2018-12-19 21:50:12 I'm so sorry Sa..TT_TT I think a lot of ppl expect amazon level of service from personal vendor and don't even realize it. They don't realize that there is 1 person who, draws, ships, packages, stocks, and runs the shop on their own. It's crazy;; T_T
492 2018-12-19 21:49:48 I am a gun owner but bump stocks are not for use in hunting or self protection. Therefore I agree with banning them. We can't let anything run without some checks in life.
493 2018-12-19 21:49:23 People in the market: stocks have gotten crushed!
People not in the market: beginning of 2017 levels are 20% lower.

494 2018-12-19 21:48:50 An S&P concentration chart should clarify. Basically 5 stocks doing poorly.
495 2018-12-19 21:48:45 And I agree with concession, have too. And I personally don’t own any bump stocks. Just hope that nothing more severe will come of it.
496 2018-12-19 21:48:24 The argument is that this is just a step toward total regulation and registration, then confiscation. Bump stocks have zero to do with gun violence.
497 2018-12-19 21:48:13 Risk off on Fed rate hike: US 10 year yield fell to 2.782%, lowest close since May. The yield has dropped nearly 0.25 percentage point this month as stocks tumbled.
498 2018-12-19 21:47:46 Still waiting for everyone praising Trump ATF for banning bump stocks to criticize Obama ATF for stupidly allowing them, despite their clear nature as Class III items subject to strict controls. Score one for properly enforce/interpret existing law, instead of piling on new laws.
499 2018-12-19 21:47:28 @realDonaldTrump Really? I mean REALLY!? Why the hell did you just ban bump stocks. People voted for you to PROTECT OUR RIGHTS NOT TAKE THEM. You have disappointed and betrayed many voters. I now have ZERO respect for you.
500 2018-12-19 21:47:21 This ban on bump stocks does absolutely nothing. Lmao
501 2018-12-19 21:47:19 A good time to observe the the correlation between $BTC and the stock market. Will be charting later.

#btc #dowjones #STOCKS
502 2018-12-19 21:46:48 Curious about average bear markets. What do you mean? Length? Magnitude? Dispersion of returns between stocks?
503 2018-12-19 21:46:27 I stopped watching market in 2006 when I sold all my stocks and businesses and retired. I moved to Europe to travel 4 years ago and the news here is far different.
504 2018-12-19 21:46:16 It’s not like the good old days when the poor were to afraid to ask for a loaf of bread for their starving family or they would be put in the stocks for begging and we would throw veg at them for fun
505 2018-12-19 21:46:10 I was referring to full-auto, not bump stocks. Full auto is legal here.
506 2018-12-19 21:46:01 Wow bump stocks are outlawed. Finally no more mass shootings! #problemsolved
507 2018-12-19 21:45:42 Des stocks !vous parlez de marchandises ou d'êtres humains comme vous 
508 2018-12-19 21:44:51 But I think this is more like Trump saying, "ya know what, you're right. We need some gun control. We will ban bump stocks. Now shut the fuck up."...he thinks the left is bad, he doesn't want to fuck with gunowners on the right
509 2018-12-19 21:44:29 So your plan is to have a currency that's backed by U.S. equities? lol 

Do you honestly think that's why the SNB has a portfolio of U.S. stocks? 

This is what your "lawyer and CFA friends" have come up with?
510 2018-12-19 21:44:26 Why are people still playing with with 2 stocks?!
511 2018-12-19 21:44:26 I don't have a problem with banning bump stocks because they are hardly ever used, and most people didn't even know what they were before Las Vegas.  But I do think it could potentially be a slippery slope situation or the camel getting its nose under the tent.
512 2018-12-19 21:43:46 Whatever you say Fudd. Serious question, does your vag get wet over the fact the NRA advocates banning bump stocks?
513 2018-12-19 21:43:44 apple stocks rise by 10%.
514 2018-12-19 21:43:14 Another school drill? FF.. And gun Confiscation.  Bump stocks.  2nd is safe. ?? Down is down
515 2018-12-19 21:42:58 Gising since 3 am bc kailangan early ma deliver mga stocks. Thank you lord 
516 2018-12-19 21:42:57 What about banning all unnecessary  stupid things that can harm people, Tide pods, cellphones, herbal supplements, marijuana(again) self driving cars, kale chips. 
I’ll trade national carry for bump stocks.
517 2018-12-19 21:42:51 The homie credibility is plummeting like stocks wit this cosign he tryna  validate lol
518 2018-12-19 21:42:47 Lg Cap All-Time Highs = same as yesterday, only 2 stocks: $KL (gold mining) and $LANC (salad dressings)
519 2018-12-19 21:42:26 Happy Powell didn't listen to you Jim.he'll be gone soon.Trump won't let some robotic Fed fool take him out from any chance to be reelected...Trump knows that as Trillions get wiped out in stocks, real estate, other assets then consumer spending, jobs, wage growth all end quickly
520 2018-12-19 21:42:07 I know the #Republicans choice of colour is ... If you could please ask @POTUS to see what he can do about refraining from painting the markets the same color. Thanks  #economy #NASDAQ #stocks #StockMarket
521 2018-12-19 21:41:55 @realDonaldTrump I still support you but No border wall...

Bump stocks will be banned..

Planned Parenthood is still fully-funded...

Hillary still isnt locked up yet...

522 2018-12-19 21:41:06 Pas de soucis c’est prévu ! Les stocks sont gérés par Amazon directement ? J’aurais demandé une dédicace sinon ;p
523 2018-12-19 21:40:53 You mean sell signal for selling stocks and move into cash?
524 2018-12-19 21:40:46 Just turn in some bump stocks, they'll legally be machine guns on Friday.
525 2018-12-19 21:40:27 Everyone is an amazing YouTuber. 
526 2018-12-19 21:39:53 The last mass shooting was with a hand gun. Bump stocks and assault rifle bans didn’t help that. Get real, we need to work on mental health intervention to keep the kooks from killing innocents.
527 2018-12-19 21:39:31 @TeamTrump you did a nice job. Stocks are going as expected this year. Thank you
528 2018-12-19 21:39:31 Trump banned bump stocks. I notice all you little sissy gun nuts ain't got shit to say about it. Guess none of you got the sack to criticize the Nazis whose boots you lick. You fucking pussies.
529 2018-12-19 21:39:21 Shorts Jumped back on them, Hard
#Gold acted like Uber Dovish #FOMC
Didn't happen
$GLD went back to being #GLD
Long #Dollar / Short $XAU / Short Gold stocks -- Back in the drivers seat

If the Fed back-peddles it will reverse again
Is it only a matter of time? We will see
530 2018-12-19 21:39:17 The stock market has never been a good indicator for the economy, it's based on "forward looking statements (predictions) that aren't exactly accurate" just look at FDX.  Great company, phenomenal earnings, tanked because of a "prediction." Stocks are unhealthy, business is good.
531 2018-12-19 21:39:04 Yeah that's exactly what I do. 7 Min, 3/2 stocks, and Omega/Battlefield only, no items.

Works every time.
532 2018-12-19 21:39:00 stocks are down y’all should cop some
533 2018-12-19 21:38:40 U.S. stocks slid after Federal Reserve officials delivered their fourth rate hike of 2018 and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that the central bank would continue to unwind its balance sheet at the current rate.
534 2018-12-19 21:38:39 Anybody else seeing a bunch of what look like fake bids on stocks in the pre market this morning? $TLS has a single bid for 2 million shares at $3.08, $CSL has one for 200k at $190, $CBA has one for 290k at $74.25 etc.
535 2018-12-19 21:38:30 Conversation started with talking about marijane stock. Buy now guys. Stocks are crashingg
536 2018-12-19 21:38:26 I'm looking at stocks still at highs due to buy backs
537 2018-12-19 21:38:20 Today was the S&P 500's worst Fed Day since 2011, according to @bespokeinvest. And the market is down all 7 Fed Days under Jerome Powell.  #stocks
538 2018-12-19 21:37:52 Thanks for the Tax Cuts that yielded nothing for the middle class but at least the wealthy and corporations were able to buyback $1T in stocks buybacks and even then DOW is lower today then it was on 1/1/2018. GOP destroyed yet another economy 10 years after Bush destroyed it
539 2018-12-19 21:37:46 Sorry ATF, I lost all my bump stocks in a boating accident
540 2018-12-19 21:37:35 #ES #Stocks #SPY 

Dboy:(4:01:27 PM) : several big margin calls went out at 2:00 ct
Dboy:(4:01:51 PM) : and I heard one S&P option fund took off half their positions
Trader Dave:(4:02:11 PM)  k..thanks for inside info
Dboy:(4:02:26 PM) : thats was a big part of the sell program
541 2018-12-19 21:37:29 Bump stocks are junk, they jam up during use and are more trouble than they're worth. If it makes people feel better regarding protection of lives in false flag shootings then good. Better an accessory than a firearm.
542 2018-12-19 21:37:22 I do understand what they are, and how they work. And I also believe they have no value or purpose. Its not the solution to mass shootings, and I'm not looking to ban any guns.  Bump stocks, not a "must have" or "need" in the gun world.
543 2018-12-19 21:37:09 If starting point in measuring vol is year before the Crash of 1929 when stocks fell 80%+ in the next few years, recent volatility is lower. How to adjust? Think price-agnostic trading (pre-1940) and value-conscious trading (post-1940). Price-agnostic trading proliferating again.
544 2018-12-19 21:37:05 Jerome Powell did the right thing.

Get ready. Stocks are about to get cheap.

#makestocksreasonablypricedagain
545 2018-12-19 21:37:04 POTUS put a ban on bump stocks for semi auto rifles.
546 2018-12-19 21:36:44 #ES #Futures #Stocks 

Why did the ES sell off 105 handles in just over an hour? The fed was a big part of it but... (continued)
547 2018-12-19 21:36:30 Miners, E&P stocks killed again today by honest financial system due to price discovery. Gold mining stocks down over 5% today as Rome burns. This happens because of collusion between government, banks & their hedge funds. America will never be great again without the Rule Of Law
548 2018-12-19 21:36:13 Marijuana stocks are popping 11% on after hours trading. BTC next
549 2018-12-19 21:35:35 I suspect criminalizing bump stocks was just a concession.  The bump stocks were sacrificed in a negotiation.  What did we get in return is what I'd like to know.
550 2018-12-19 21:35:23 Stocks on track for the worst December since the Great Depression...watch close a come up is upon us
551 2018-12-19 21:35:12 I'll consult with Levin first and get back to you later. Point is bump stocks will be the last thing on your mind when they left takes you for all the other freedoms and puts you in jail for disobeying. Social media has been appointed by Dems to take 1st A
552 2018-12-19 21:35:08 because their retirement accounts are invested in Defense Stocks?!
553 2018-12-19 21:35:04 Mark Z should be fired, Help wanted NEW CEO is needed NOW- Stop giving our information away, Stocks are going to fall maybe he will lose everything
554 2018-12-19 21:34:56 Well.  I guess a recession is certain now, and it’s happening between the end of 2019 and the end of 2020.  Eurodollars pinpointing this thing.  Stocks did not like this statement of Q&A by Powell and company.  Millennials finally, after a decade, get to see what a bear mkt is
555 2018-12-19 21:34:44 The purpose of stock buybacks is to decrease the number of stocks and drive up the prices for stockholders. But the market has tanked, so the values are down. That $1Tr went *poof*, but the hole left in the federal deficit from the tax cuts is real. A massive, complete #FAIL.
556 2018-12-19 21:34:43 BS....bump stocks are a gimmick and have no bearing on the 2nd amendment.....waste ammo and crazy who just want to throw lead....no fire discipline !!!!!
557 2018-12-19 21:34:23 I'm no Economist, but I feel the FED should act in a way that the Market prices in-  If they failed to hike without giving much warning on the "WHY", Stocks would have reacted worse-My personal feeling is that the FED IS hiking into a fragile economy, & should let things run hot
558 2018-12-19 21:34:12 They're no point. All we've grown up on is bubbles. People bitch that there's no volume in stocks anymore. But I'll tell you that I don't know 1 person IRL that trades. Most don't even have a 401k.
559 2018-12-19 21:33:59 My stocks keep dropping and im not okay with that
560 2018-12-19 21:33:55 just be cool and keep a watch on some good stocks, buy low sale high !!
561 2018-12-19 21:33:54 as a marth main, I can confirm that this is exactly what I tell my mom when I’m two stocks behind
562 2018-12-19 21:33:30 Bump stocks are like curb feelers on cars.
563 2018-12-19 21:33:22 $MARA at the bottom looking good for a low float bounce! #STOCKS #options #hedgefunds
564 2018-12-19 21:33:14 What's concerning is when stock, credit and commodities markets are all selling off at once b/c it suggests real money is pulling out of the ALL markets.  Typically a rotation into gov.t bonds accompanies a sell-off  in stocks b/c govt bonds are a guaranteed return vs equities.
565 2018-12-19 21:32:53 Your stocks should be doing great then. Mine are.
566 2018-12-19 21:32:50 Indeed, but with a monthly presser, Powell might reverse its stance already in January but in the mean time stocks could suffer (a lot). Kind of replay of 1987 imo
567 2018-12-19 21:32:48 IAPWHAPOH RN SONIC THREE STOCKS ISABELLE TO BREAK HIS LOSING STREAK AS WELL AND UH YEAH OK NICE #SmashBros #NintendoSwitch
568 2018-12-19 21:32:46 @dbongino First I love your Podcast, thanks.  What is your opinion on the POTUS admin. banning, and confiscation of bump stocks. I never heard of them until the tragedy in Vegas. I am a life member of NRA, but limited on my knowledge . Your opinion would be of great value to me.
569 2018-12-19 21:32:07 You're an idiot bump stocks don't make any weapon fire bullets faster or make them more powerful. Know about weapons before you speak about then
570 2018-12-19 21:31:42 Yes, stocks/indexes closed too near their lows for it to be a flush IMHO. I like to see reversal hammers.  Still feel like there's a catalyst needed i.e. big fund blows up, Robinhood blows up, ya know :)
571 2018-12-19 21:31:33 By tomorrow morning America's unfunded liabilities will be $116 Trillion Dollars, having grown three quarters of a Trillion Dollars since Oct. 25th. Yet mining stocks down over 5% today due to criminal collusion between Fed/Treasury ESF & banks, hedge funds front running the PPT.
572 2018-12-19 21:31:31 UK Market Close: Stocks stage small rebound ahead of US Fed
573 2018-12-19 21:31:22 Bump stocks are typically in the fixed semi-auto mode, unless you’re wasting rounds at a private range. If real-world circumstances should ever motivate you to go full slide fire mode... god help you. But however many are down range might be discouraged or slowed a mite?
574 2018-12-19 21:31:18 Dumping half of my $FB shares tomorrow morning, against my general instinct to hold FAANG stocks till death.
575 2018-12-19 21:30:24 All manipulated-the insiders will buy back stocks & make the money they made people lose-get this Fed chairman OUT! No need to upset growth & prosperity now-all to hurt @realDonaldTrump -to brainwash them with their lies & help #Globalists
576 2018-12-19 21:30:13 Sell all the stocks now. They will be worth less next week.
577 2018-12-19 21:30:10 If you know me you know I’m all pro guns but tbh I’m glad they are banning bump stocks there really is not point to owning one
578 2018-12-19 21:29:50 Cranborne Stores just across the square from us on the @cranborneestate stocks @DorsetBlueVinny too.
579 2018-12-19 21:29:31 You people are ridiculous. The guyy said data dependent every way imaginable.  We are talkimg about 2.5% for gods sake.  That is epically low rates.  With tac cuts kicking in, rates at 2, and gdp 2-3 % you are bailing on your stocks?  Sell them all, ill be there to buy.
580 2018-12-19 21:29:26 That’s down from Apex’s original estimate of $2 the other day with this being the reason “Bro, I make a living from penny stocks...All I now is that $MYLI will make me rich.”  Nicely said.
581 2018-12-19 21:29:20 Ah, but who's wealth, exactly?

Most Americans have no short interest in stocks. 

There are justified reasons to raise interest rates. It strengthens us in the long run.
582 2018-12-19 21:29:16 What’s happening with the bump stocks is not because of its usefulness, it’s useless piece of shit equipment. I’m against regulation at all. Any legally owned automatic weapons in vegas, that guy would’ve had trouble getting off round one, his position would’ve been  idk...
583 2018-12-19 21:29:01 Short their stocks, they'll soon go bankrupt.....
584 2018-12-19 21:29:00 If you have 25k to invest, what would you do?  #BTC #Stocks
585 2018-12-19 21:28:45 Bump stocks are harmless pieces of plastic that are a ton of fun to use. 

In the end, the ban is a slippery slope towards criminalizing innocuous firearms accessories that’ll do nothing to mitigate crime.
586 2018-12-19 21:28:42 The vast majority of stocks ARE much cheaper already, with a little decline of profit growth. Don’t see ehy everything is explained negatively
587 2018-12-19 21:28:16 Cause stocks are overvalued ;)
588 2018-12-19 21:28:14 How do I know it’s time for my lunch break? I read this @JeannieLee88 headline as “socks stink” instead of “stocks sink”     
589 2018-12-19 21:27:42 But not bump stocks right...those are too scary to trust citizens with. Go support @gunpolicy, they’re actually fighting for the 2A.
590 2018-12-19 21:27:31 I agree we may not be there yet - but stocks are a leading indicator (if not the MOST reliable one!). I would be surprised if we are not in a recession by summer.
591 2018-12-19 21:27:25 Great. Now there will be plenty of room for the hundreds of thousands of people who own bump stocks and will be felons in possession in 90 days, because Trump decided to pull a pen and phone trick.
592 2018-12-19 21:27:21 Now here is my theory regarding the pulling of military from Sera is because he is going to take that money and use it for his so called wall. Just brain storming. Wonder if he has steel stocks. LOLOLOL
He has to go.
593 2018-12-19 21:27:10 BREAKING: STOCKS PLUNGE AGAIN.

When Trump told #MAGA voters to buy stocks, the smart money started selling.

DJIA:

Jan 30: 26,439

Dec 19: 23,323

If you took Trump's advice to buy stocks during his 2018 #SOTU address, you are now down 12%, even as inflation continues to rise.
594 2018-12-19 21:27:08 @realDonaldTrump  can you please fire the Fed chair. He single handily destroyed every gain I had in stocks and Iras in 2years
595 2018-12-19 21:27:08 Better than he is at actual stocks!
596 2018-12-19 21:26:45 'Tis the Season to sell your stocks for a loss because 'Taxes' coming up in April.

Buy them back and make it a Happier New Year....
597 2018-12-19 21:26:42 I like loyalty as much as anybody, but the President needs to stop listening to whoever thinks that "prison reform", giving $10B for the countries that are the source of the immigration problem and banning bump stocks are MAGA.
598 2018-12-19 21:26:34 Air bnb growing volumes, and hotels like Marriott providing open doors to hackers for half decade are causing investors to dump hotel stocks! @CNBCFastMoney @nytimes @MSNBC @Forbes @CitronResearch @WSJ The uberfication of America continues!
599 2018-12-19 21:26:27 If you are going to dump him because of bump stocks I feel very sorry for you! So when the Democrats take over in 2020 because people stopped supporting @POTUS they will come after all guns! #2AShallNotBeInfringed  a bump stock is stupid- you can’t hit shit- u can do same by hand
600 2018-12-19 21:26:26  Pleased that it supports Welsh communities and healthy fish stocks too
601 2018-12-19 21:26:13 Agreed...ironically, what he did sped the ending, not slowed it...but I think they think they're slowing it.  Everything he did today made US fiscal situation less tenable, not more.  If stocks don't rise, US fiscal situation goes *boom* far sooner than most think
602 2018-12-19 21:25:48 You exemplify why ppl loathe academics. You're justifying the Fed's history of moving to one extreme side of the boat just as it's heavily leaning in that direction and about to snap back the other way? Perhaps take a look at charts other than stocks for the past 3mos.
603 2018-12-19 21:25:44 Yes, as if liberals don't also own stocks.
604 2018-12-19 21:25:41 I'm not mad, it's just a reminder that there's still a lot of learning in this game to not have my stocks janked out if I'm playing Yoshi
605 2018-12-19 21:25:30 From flash update last night... "So the setup is here for a post-Fed rally in stocks and a selloff in precious metals. DUST (3x short GDX) would be the play here as GDX is the most overbought..."  Got it half right!
606 2018-12-19 21:25:21 No reason to raise it other then to bring stocks down and slow the economy. It's a shame everyone in government are making decisions based on politics rather then what's good for the country and it's only gonna get worse come January
607 2018-12-19 21:25:16 Uhhh...Bump Stocks are "gadgets" used for guns - just like a scope. I don't know of any shooter who cares about them...not a big deal.
608 2018-12-19 21:24:38 2nd Amendment patriots with your “bump stock” ban. Many many of us are law abiding citizens and you will make us criminals with the “bump stock witch hunt” stop this or at least grandfather those who legally own these products. You cannot arbitrarily take our stocks
609 2018-12-19 21:24:31 Yah hopefully Canadian stocks do well
610 2018-12-19 21:24:29 Bump stocks are stupid and serve no purpose. That being said, no one has a right or a moral duty to stop someone from using one for any reason. As long as they are not hurting anyone else it is immoral to prevent them from doing what they want.
611 2018-12-19 21:23:36 I’m not even thinking about individual stocks. $SPY first, stocks later
612 2018-12-19 21:23:26 $FDX, $MU, $FB, $AGN, and $AMD are the top five stocks that closed lower today.
613 2018-12-19 21:23:26 $GE and $GIS both gained over 5% and are Wednesday's top performing $SPX #stocks; $AIG closed up over 4% and $PCG and $FANG both gained over 3% while $NFX $HSY $LLY and $SEE all gained over 2% on the day #trading
614 2018-12-19 21:23:25 Thanks for stabbing us in the back!! Can’t wait to see your unconstitutional order in court! Can Congress ban bump stocks? Probably as they are not in common use, but the executive has ZERO power to ban.
615 2018-12-19 21:23:25 This guy appears to be in over his head....awful news conference as stocks reacted 
616 2018-12-19 21:23:19 making 2018 the worst for stocks since the years of the US Economic Depression .... What’s Next? Could very well be a total chaos .. 2
617 2018-12-19 21:23:19 I would listen to @GlobalFire123 , esp if he listed his 5 favorite U stocks! ; )
618 2018-12-19 21:23:14 Es super chistoso sacar stocks con el PKFreeze
619 2018-12-19 21:22:51 Bump stocks are a much different animal. No different than fully automatic and should be illegal. I am very much pro gun and anti bump stock.
620 2018-12-19 21:22:45 So how many crooks are going to turn in their bump stocks? There is always going to be ways around the automatic gun restriction.
621 2018-12-19 21:22:41 only commodity that is up is oil and that is just a bounce from yesterdays fall. stocks, gold, etc falling like rain.   I just hung up with Dennis and catching up with him tomorrow at lunch.  will tell him he needs to move into BC.
622 2018-12-19 21:22:24 $GE, $GIS, $AIG, $PCG, and $FANG were the top five stocks that closed higher today.
623 2018-12-19 21:22:04 Because somethings serve no good purpose & if you think bump stocks are something you need, you belong in watch lists.
624 2018-12-19 21:21:50 You are truly a master of the stocks! Keep rocking man keep rocking
625 2018-12-19 21:21:43 $GE, $AMD, $BAC, $MU, and $FB were the top five most active stocks today.
626 2018-12-19 21:21:22 Threatening behaviour. Should be arrested. Then put in the stocks for three days.
627 2018-12-19 21:20:40 Couple days ago when the online coupon was still good, Franklin, TN Hwy 96E and Coolsprings. I think Pepsi stocks, but never enough during a sale.
628 2018-12-19 21:19:44 This really isn't difficult. 

Bump stocks should probably be illegal. Congress should pass a law to make them illegal. The president has exactly 0 power to make new law and any attempt to do so is illegal.
629 2018-12-19 21:19:25 I am gonna pass this on to a Trumpy that thinks stocks JUST fluctuate.
630 2018-12-19 21:19:18 I don’t like to short highly manipulated stocks. These include:

$intc
$tlry
$tsla

Long history of very, very, very suspicious stock price movement. Beware shorting these.

632 2018-12-19 21:19:07 Bye bye bump stocks  #winning

*Lance une partie en cherchant 2 Stocks 3 min*
*tombe dans un match temps avec objet*
Me : Eh c'toujours de la merde.
634 2018-12-19 21:18:37 Come on brother full auto? Does bump stocks have the same rate of fire now?
635 2018-12-19 21:18:20 I must agree with you there since it’s looked at as property. Even though I can’t shoot you for stealing my car which is stupid. So then you agree bump stocks and any other weapon accessories should not be limited due to being property?
636 2018-12-19 21:18:17 It's a symbolic thing. No one gives a hoot about bump stocks.
637 2018-12-19 21:18:16 Bump stocks are stupid. But how Trump went about banning them is extremely dangerous and will set a bad precedent if not challenged. The next POTUS could use it to go after something you do care about, then you'll be pissed. And shit out of luck.
638 2018-12-19 21:18:04 When you can't keep up in the discussion, just resort to insults.  SMH.  I've got 22 years in the military and personally own more than 20 firearms and am a lifetime NRA member.  Defending junk toys like bump stocks is how you lose credibility in the debate.  Do better.
639 2018-12-19 21:17:33 Stocks - Dow Slumps as Less Dovish Fed Triggers Selloff
640 2018-12-19 21:17:33 I bought stocks today (first time in a while) and covered some shorts. Raised exposure by 15-20%. We'll see...
641 2018-12-19 21:17:23 Didnt you predict stocks would go hire if feds hiked the rates?  I remember hearing you say that in a few of your videos.
642 2018-12-19 21:17:18 How can stocks be down big annualized with an historic $1 Trillion in stock buybacks in 2018?
643 2018-12-19 21:17:11 Stocks fell, MPs still arguing amongst themselves, day got shorter... pretty par for the course at the moment
644 2018-12-19 21:17:00 The intention is, and has always been, to disarm the public.  This can only be accomplished by brainwashing the unwashed masses into thinking vastly differently about guns.  Bump stocks are low hanging fruit.  Otherwise, I agree, they are simply a fun method of pissing away ammo
645 2018-12-19 21:16:59 I think they should have followed their favored son Elon Musk and did tranches of 420 stocks :-).
646 2018-12-19 21:16:32 #Markets are now pricing in a rate cut in 2020. #Bonds yields are collapsing, #stocks are collapsing, inflations breakeven are collapsing, #fed is raising rates and tightening. Who is right? #OOTT
647 2018-12-19 21:16:30 Weather bump stocks are useful is irrelevant the issue here is what will fall in the same category (triggers,mags....)
648 2018-12-19 21:16:20 There will be plenty of lead in the air when they go door to door trying to confiscate these bump stocks.
649 2018-12-19 21:16:19 Im long gold stocks every day 
650 2018-12-19 21:15:53 Jennifer, that means there are still more than 200 stocks not down 200%. Seriously, the biggest problem this mkt faces is that most participants have never seen an avg bear mkt. They assume 2000-2002 and 2007-2009 are the only possible scenarios for a bear mkt.
651 2018-12-19 21:15:52 MY Point is,, the ATF is already spreading this # so they can ask for it for "collection" of these stocks. When, most people will turn theirs in voluntarily. It's all bullshit to inflate their budget. Just like the BS "immigration" cost, mitigates inflated bugets.
652 2018-12-19 21:15:37 Picking up these stocks for the low
653 2018-12-19 21:15:33 We are already free to own fully automatic weapons, provided you go through the proper process.  Bump stocks circumvent the NFA process, and make a non NFA weapon operate as an NFA weapon.  
The ATF already regulates things on the edges of the NFA.  This is no different.
654 2018-12-19 21:15:29 Lol. Better buy all the stocks you can
655 2018-12-19 21:15:23 @realDonaldTrump
Stocks decline clearly a result of the Democrats platform when they control congress. Traders don't like raising taxes additional regulations that stymie the economy.

Back to 1% GDP
656 2018-12-19 21:15:11 We agree on 99% of issues but not here. Bumper-stocks are work-around - make semi-auto into (near) automatic. If only purpose is to circumvent the law then not sure why, other than slippery slope argument, conservatives would support them. Open to learning?
657 2018-12-19 21:15:11 Instead of being upset at the recent price action we should use this opportunity as a learning tool.  Study the behavior of leading stocks heading into Oct and see if you can identify any character changes which started to develop even before this downtrend took hold.
658 2018-12-19 21:15:01 Hi there! JUST Egg is not yet available in all Publix stores, but we are pleased to share, it is available in approximately 600 locations. I recommend speaking to the Store or Grocery Manager on your next visit to see if your store currently stocks this item.  ◘Allison
659 2018-12-19 21:14:59 @Richzeoli maybe @GREGSTOCKER is in a funk today because after banning bump stocks, next they'll come for his bumper music.
660 2018-12-19 21:14:27 A .223 is going through your wall and your neighbors.  These bump stocks and trigger cranks are just loop holes for almost fully automatic weapons. Zero use in home defense.
661 2018-12-19 21:14:25 Index funds are better than individual stocks since no one care about fundamentals either up or down
662 2018-12-19 21:14:16 My bump stock opinion if you care or not. 
Chipping away at freedom is the slippery slope that is ignored until they come for something of yours. I don’t care about or own bump stocks. That’s not the point.  Erosion of freedom is.
#Constitution #2ndAmendment
663 2018-12-19 21:14:16 Do not like the bearish tone, but do respect you wisdom in regards to stocks etc.
You make me watch my stocks even more....
664 2018-12-19 21:13:59 Trump has 17 investigations into his political and business dealings. 

He’s illegally banning bump stocks. 

His tariffs are wrecking the economy. 

He just surrendered to ISIS, Assad, and Putin in Syria. 

A sad moment for the US.

670 2018-12-19 21:13:19 Then there is absolutely no need for bumb stocks then.
671 2018-12-19 21:13:10 because stocks are 40% too high at a minimum

(Don't @ me with "liberal gun hater shit. I own guns. I've personally owned an AR. You don't hunt with them. Nor are bump stocks necessary for anything at all.)
674 2018-12-19 21:12:08 Both sides have been talking about reducing drug prices for long time. Where are the results? If it’s an bipartisan issue, why isn’t anything being done? And fking arrest Politicians who own stocks in these companies and write health laws.

Nasdaq -2.2%, S&P -1.5%.

681 2018-12-19 21:11:01 You know that I had family issues and had to travel to a funeral Jesus Christ. I posted a lot about stocks in the chat and had many members DM me asking for help which I gladly did. I did more for that group than what you would think. I'm all about what people say and holding
682 2018-12-19 21:10:58 Chipping away at freedom is the slippery slope that is ignored until they come for something of yours. I don’t care about and don’t own bump stocks. That’s not the point.  Erosion of freedom is.
683 2018-12-19 21:10:42 HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT!  Only problem is that he was against it! His plan was the opposite- privatization of prisons etc. This is why prison stocks had a great year last year. Trumps plan was the opposite of what passed the house. The pressure came frm Kushner, Van Jones & other
684 2018-12-19 21:10:34 Bump stocks are accessories and not particularly useful ones at that.
685 2018-12-19 21:09:59 Stocks close sharply lower after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the fourth time this year.

693 2018-12-19 21:09:05 First off, they are not really sharing the wealth.  The tax scam allowed companies to do record number of stock buy backs.  This inflated the value of their stock but, it was a false value.  Now the stocks market is correcting itself. Jobs will be cut now to make investors happy.
694 2018-12-19 21:08:55 To be honest I was expecting USD flying and stocks lightly offered. It went the opposite -> stocks dumped and DXY barely green.
695 2018-12-19 21:08:37 Out of 7,300 trading days since 1990, today's percentage of new lows among financial stocks is larger than 7,296 of them.

697 2018-12-19 21:08:11 The ONLY thing that’s been done is making bump stocks illegal. What has he done to make schools safe. Please explain
698 2018-12-19 21:07:51 I like my guns
I like shooting targets
Quite frankly the people complaining about bump stocks becoming illegal are out of their minds
Theres a massive lack of control when using them
You can’t hardly hit your target why do you want them
699 2018-12-19 21:07:41 I’m not a fan of bump stocks, but I like the real thing.
700 2018-12-19 21:07:37 you better be the one to make sure erin stocks them then
701 2018-12-19 21:06:51 I want to learn how to invest in stocks
702 2018-12-19 21:06:41 What you mean people don’t use large caliber rifles with bump stocks for concealed carry or home defense? You gotta fire off a few hundred rounds to really protect yourself.
703 2018-12-19 21:06:32 A bit off topic, but congrats to Trump for banning bump stocks. It's a start. Now for the high-cap mags. Those a more dangerous. Good job anyway.
704 2018-12-19 21:06:20 Funny how when the right boycotts a company their stocks go up. I’ve got a little money in the stock market. Could you please boycott Disney? And have a happy holiday you crazy grinches!
705 2018-12-19 21:06:14 @TeamCavuto Stocks have been ona downwards trend. And it has nothing to do with the Fed. Stop blowing trump’s smoke up your viewers butt
706 2018-12-19 21:06:08 Trump outlawed bump stocks and silence from the hillbilly NRA loving community.....amazing
707 2018-12-19 21:05:46 Bump stocks are a joke. Any shooter can do the same thing without...
Basically , just pull forward with the forward hand while squeezing the trigger.
708 2018-12-19 21:05:41 WHY DID TRUMP ban BUMP STOCKS?
Because he knows the SUDDEN COLLAPSE of The Dollar is just around the corner.
709 2018-12-19 21:05:28 Since when are bump stocks guns?
710 2018-12-19 21:05:18 Believe me I'm on point about the end game. My statement was about how lucky we were this time around and it was just bump stocks. Anti-gunners where given something Trump, the Republicans and the NRA are still defending our rights.
711 2018-12-19 21:05:15 Stocks plunge after Fed announces new rate hike. The Dow hit +382 but fell to close at 23,323.66, down 351.98 (-1.49%). Nasdaq -2.17%. S&P -1.54%.

714 2018-12-19 21:04:50 Not saying forward is for sure. But my read of them says that stocks are very undervalued. Those cheerleading a flat year for stocks because it hurts Trump will look awfully silly this time next year.
715 2018-12-19 21:04:35 The clock ran out on Javanka. Trump is done. What’s he gonna run on? The markets? Nooo. Gun stocks? Nooo. Daca
716 2018-12-19 21:04:34 No, Automatic weapons are already banned.  Bump stocks turn semi-auto guns to auto thus they are already banned by law
717 2018-12-19 21:04:22 “enslaving commies”  Why the unwillingness to answer the question re bump stocks? It is an exercise in futility trying to have a logical conversation with an illogical person. I’m busy. @ me all you want. But, I am sure you’re busy too - don’t you have a deli to run? 
718 2018-12-19 21:03:47 As the financial markets start to realize @realDonaldTrump economic policy is dangerous and doesn't work stocks made a 15 month low today. If you invested the day of his inauguration you've made the same return as treasuries. When it comes to the economy he is no @BarackObama !
719 2018-12-19 21:03:45 People who think bump stocks are good should also be for us allowing sawed of shot guns.
720 2018-12-19 21:03:07 $adro did me dirty. Literally waited the entire day to make that $3 push. This is what I was wanting in the morning but it didn't work. 

Timing is important in a successful trade #stocks
721 2018-12-19 21:03:05 Good thing that I converted my 401k a few months ago and have not invested that money in stocks. But otherwise sucks.
722 2018-12-19 21:03:03 @realDonaldTrump stocks just took another shit, any comments?
723 2018-12-19 21:03:00 Trump is done and he should quit. The economy sucks, Trump caves on wall AGAIN, bump stocks yielded, 10 billion in payola to Hispanics, Daca and common core has not been ended. WTF? Beto looks good.

When the economy slows from a peak like it is now, wealth shifts away from growth stocks and towards bond proxies and defensive positions.
728 2018-12-19 21:02:38 BREAKING: STOCKS PLUNGE AGAIN.

When Trump told #MAGA voters to buy stocks, the smart money started selling.

DJIA:

Dec 19: 23,323

If you took Trump's advice to buy stocks during his 2018 #SOTU address, you are now down 12%, even as inflation continues to rise.
729 2018-12-19 21:02:36 @richzeoli Forget bump stocks and AR15s and all the other stuff. Let's just outlaw murder and mayhem and the means become impotent.
730 2018-12-19 21:02:27 #2A isn't about home defense.  Bump stocks and automatic rifles should not be illegal.

747 2018-12-19 20:59:58 Too much uncertainty and risk to buy and hold stocks right now...
748 2018-12-19 20:59:39 Opinion: the new ban on bump stocks is not going to help our mass shooting problem. If a criminal wants a bump stock, he’s going to get one illegally no matter what. 

We must address the root cause of gun violence-PEOPLE. People are inherently evil. (1/2)
749 2018-12-19 20:59:17 You know I don't like him.  Nor do the conservatives who have worked in the White House with him if you've read Fear.  I said banning bump stocks and the crime bill were both good decisions yesterday.  But I'm still going to disagree 98% of the time because I think he's a buffoon
750 2018-12-19 20:59:11 Not in the stocks, fool.
751 2018-12-19 20:59:02 Crushing the gold stocks which had been counter trend plays.  

Stocks are not defensive assets.
752 2018-12-19 20:58:52 If you have a 3+ year time horizon  (any money invested in the stock market should), this is a time to buy stocks, not sell them.
753 2018-12-19 20:58:22 Have you noticed the silence of the NRA/ILA on Trump's banning of Bump Stocks?
754 2018-12-19 20:58:22 Outlaw Bump-stocks & Only Outlaws Will Have Bump-stocks @Richzeoli
755 2018-12-19 20:58:14 If 65K nunchucks is enough for common use, then a million is more than enough for bump stocks, standard capacity magazines, gas operated rifles, etc 
Attempting to claim that the best selling rifle and its accessories, for the last two decades, are unusual is a feeble lie

757 2018-12-19 20:57:45 I didn’t say they should be legal. Know one ever Hurd of bump stocks until the Las Vegas shooting. I don’t see how they gonna know who even has them
758 2018-12-19 20:57:43 Dow going to 21,000...Don't buy stocks till Trade War has ended and Powell has stopped raising interest rates and quantitative tightening...China is going to play long game with US...Don't expect trade deal until 2020 after Trump leaves office...

760 2018-12-19 20:57:15 The previous wounds were self-inflicted. He can eliminate the disastrous tariffs and stop trying to manipulate the markets out of spite. He’s probably ridden GE all the way down, is watching Amazon kill his retail-sector stocks, and he’s lashing out. HE’s the cause.
761 2018-12-19 20:56:25 Makes me think I need to buy more pot stocks
762 2018-12-19 20:56:14 @Surgeon_General I see you own some Tobacco stocks.  How very hypocritical of you..... @FDATobacco No conflict of interest right??
763 2018-12-19 20:55:55 How many children are shot with bump stocks?
764 2018-12-19 20:55:41 All of my tech stocks have gotten cheaper.
765 2018-12-19 20:55:10 The 2nd Amendment is not for home defense, it's for government tyranny defense and bump stocks should be legal.
766 2018-12-19 20:54:57 Recently:
Kavanaugh declined to take Planned Parenthood case

Bump stocks are being banned

We aren't getting the wall, but are giving aid to the country that is supposed to pay for it

Bad times for MAGA. Let's see if this is all not to take attention away from "the plan"
767 2018-12-19 20:54:26 If everyone can do this, how come most don't? What percentage of people own stocks?

When you are picking between paying rent, paying for meds or eating talk to me about buying stock or starting a business.
768 2018-12-19 20:54:18 Way too many stocks have retraced at present.

771 2018-12-19 20:54:05 This is not the reason.  Other than Russia, the NRA’s biggest financial backers are the MUNITIONS INDUSTRY.  As a group, these guys don’t give a damn about bump stocks.
772 2018-12-19 20:53:59 Seems likely yes.. but maintaining stable or growing assets & stocks seem to be required now given over financialization of economy. Meaning foreigners better come in real strong if US consumer is tapped out..
773 2018-12-19 20:53:50 Obama: Trump isn't smart enough to figure out how to violate the Constitution with a pen and phone like I did.

Trump: Oh yeah? Watch.

Bump stocks!
774 2018-12-19 20:53:41 The # of Bump stocks has soared from insignificant (~50k) to still very low, but huge a increase (~500k) since they uttered: "ban"

Almost none will be turned in based on #'s in states that already banned them

Remember, you don't need to turn them in. You can destroy it yourself
775 2018-12-19 20:53:39 It’s 100% legal for members of Congress to buy or sell stocks in the businesses they make laws for. Senators Sherrod Brown and Jeff Merkley have introduced a new bill to stop this conflict of interest.

I've never liked that term. Sounds like a perfect HARMONY of interests.
776 2018-12-19 20:53:15 stocks shit and vix is -2%? sure, why not, makes sense.
777 2018-12-19 20:53:00 More like a sudden rush of cocky dumbasses playing the market. Happened in tech stocks, housing, crypto, etc. Not saying you're one of them but if you look at twitter, stocktwits, FB/Youtube ads.. there were many signs of Euphoria out there. Especially January 2018.
778 2018-12-19 20:52:59 Stocks down big. The fed is purposely tanking the economy.

Today Trump pulled out of Syria, his foundation was dissolved, Flynn was in court yesterday, his sentence was postponed, you can read the transcript, the feds increased the int rates, the stocks went down after, Men. Announced end of some Russia sanctions
781 2018-12-19 20:50:22 First they came for the bump stocks, and I said nothing, because I did not own a bump stock...
782 2018-12-19 20:50:14 Somewhat Dovish Fed Hike Is Not Enough For Stocks
783 2018-12-19 20:50:05 creditors seem to be softening given growing evidence our true deficits will be even higher: entitlements & inability to cut spending.Moves to price oil in other currencies lead to attempts to get away from $.We'll see... tax receipts should fall as well given reliance on stocks
784 2018-12-19 20:49:51 Someone can be convicted of a crime and not be considered dangerous regardless if convicted you still lose your right to bear arms. The point is great responsibility comes with gun ownership. Bump stocks are not the root issue.
785 2018-12-19 20:49:40 Vegas shooter used bump stocks not assault rifles
786 2018-12-19 20:49:35 Trade those “machine gun bump stocks” if you haven’t lost it in a boating accident yet.

788 2018-12-19 20:49:31 I see many stocks have hammer candle which I like
789 2018-12-19 20:48:56 Has there ever been a mass shooting without a gun? You think automatic weapons and bump stocks mean FEWER people will die in a mass shooting? This is a stupid argument. But yeah, you definitely need those things to hunt...
790 2018-12-19 20:48:37 Vix is down. Despite some weak earnings, this sell off looks yield curve related with financials getting hammered and bonds rallying hard. Beware of the extreme buying in bond land.  #tbt #stocks #valueinvesting
791 2018-12-19 20:48:35 Totally agree - also, rates are now pricing in ~10-15bps of hikes for all next year, and yet stocks are worried the @federalreserve is hawkish - quite inconsistent.
792 2018-12-19 20:48:33 Bump stocks suck horrible accuracy.
Government bans fully auto anyway, bump stocks are people trying to get around how the law is written.
793 2018-12-19 20:48:29 HYG underperforming on an equity-beta-adjusted basis by 3.5σ, worst day all year relative to stocks. Similar story in BKLN (-4σ vs SPY).
794 2018-12-19 20:48:10 I wonder if the Criminal Justice Reform package will include de minimis fines and sentences for gun owners who lawfully purchased something later deemed illegal (standard capacity magazines, bump stocks).

796 2018-12-19 20:47:55 @Richzeoli in light of bump stocks, the Red Rider BB gun from Christmas Story will be banned because "you'll shoot your eye out".
797 2018-12-19 20:47:46 Has HD use of bump stocks actually been a rallying cry for those opposed to this government overreach?
798 2018-12-19 20:47:45 $FED for all those throwing away stocks, the Fed isn't going to hike again
799 2018-12-19 20:47:41 You still have to push the weapon forward while pulling the stock rearward. Bump Stocks DO NOT convert the weapon to fully automatic! Why are people from England attacking our 2nd Amendment? It makes a person wonder.

804 2018-12-19 20:46:50 He owns stock in Pfizer, Merck and a few others, too. Stocks in what makes people sick, stocks in what gets them "better". Win win for him.
805 2018-12-19 20:46:40 "turning point for stocks came after Powell said, 'a little volatility doesn't leave a mark,' hinting that the Fed isn't too worried about the recent market downturn that sent stocks to new lows, the Dow is on track to close at its lowest level of the year"
806 2018-12-19 20:46:20 I wonder if that is why my ammosexual neighbors have been playing with their bump stocks so much yesterday and today. It sounds like civil war has started out hear in the middle of nowhere.
807 2018-12-19 20:46:18 Main street won't be doing so well when no one buys house, travels, eats out,books hotels, buys things......when Trillions of wealth in stocks/home equity is wiped out by happy Powell the US economy, jobs, growth crashes very fast....

825 2018-12-19 20:43:33 There may be no wall, but at least Trump unconstitutionally banned bump stocks by regulation.
826 2018-12-19 20:43:32 The conversation today is Trump and the wall while completely ignoring Trump making bump stocks illegal. WTF! Wake up Americans still standing with Trump.
827 2018-12-19 20:43:25 Fed raised (as expected) rates by .25%.  They lowered their 2019 outlook from 3 hikes to 2, as they feel more gradual increases are needed.  Stocks are retreating on the news.

830 2018-12-19 20:42:48 Bump stocks are finally getting banned  Thank You Mr. Trump!
831 2018-12-19 20:42:38 Noteworthy but not unusual, all those stocks and groups that received reccos from brokerage firms, their gains for the most part went the way of all flesh. That is the kind of mkt we are in. News doesn't matter. $SPX $NDX $IWM
832 2018-12-19 20:42:34 The #Trump administration has officially banned #BumpStocks. Owners of these attachments will have 90 days to destroy or turn over the stocks after the law goes into effect on Friday. What are your thoughts on this development? #BumpStockBan
833 2018-12-19 20:41:54 My view is the market has written off the dots long ago, by pricing below for some time. So what matters (in my view) is no longer the LEVEL but the CHANGE in the dots. I don't think SPX down is a sign this meeting is hawkish, stocks are just trading more cautious growth view.
834 2018-12-19 20:41:41 I think it’s the last part of the puzzle, all pieces are in place ready. Also money flying out of stocks and they will be looking for a regulated crypto asset sat at its yearly bottom...

847 2018-12-19 20:38:19 He managed to outlaw "bump stocks" within two years. That's more than Obama did in 8. So yes, you can be critical of someone you voted for. 

Obama pushed through the ACA when they had control of Congress. Pretty much the only time you can do that is right in the beginning.
848 2018-12-19 20:38:10 Another 4% intraday range in stocks, but at this point no one is surprised.
849 2018-12-19 20:37:48 OK

853 2018-12-19 20:37:21 Kinda have a bone to pick with you man, your an outdoors guy. A gun guy. Don't you see a problem with a president that just re-defines what a machine gun is? Bump stocks are not the problem but @realDonaldTrump just banning stuff out of the air is a huge fucking problem.
854 2018-12-19 20:36:53 Any thoughts on today’s reaction for gold stocks on the fed hike?
855 2018-12-19 20:36:43 When Rates go up someone can no longer qualify for a Home Loan or a car loan. A guaranteed return of 2-3% interest on Savings is better than the ups and downs of Stocks & some cash out of the markets. Why does the Fed wants to make these basic things harder for Workers to get?
856 2018-12-19 20:36:30 Ari dumb as hell  i would’ve broke Herb pockets the whole time he out flying around with bitches, I’m buying homes & stocks ... nope she on IG doing flat tummy tea all yall hoes crazy if you ask me
857 2018-12-19 20:35:52 Low interest rate during Obama, companies rack up massive debt. Fed now raises rates, debt is huge headwind for stocks. Should blame Fed, not Trump.
858 2018-12-19 20:35:48 Plunge Protection jokers are trying hard to prop up the market. They are manipulating bond markets now in order to prop up the stocks. Their ammunition seems to be weakening at the moment!
859 2018-12-19 20:35:48 Poor Rudy. You once had the respect of the nation. Now do you like your client or laughing stocks. And liars.
860 2018-12-19 20:35:22 President Trump, the Fed by raising the rates has just kicked the American economy into the gutter to squash any positive appeal for stocks. We now join Europe on the verge of recession, and a flat line in Asia. The Fed, are they Americans on board with your agenda? Or what?
861 2018-12-19 20:35:18 Wish I had money to buy stocks on these red days 
862 2018-12-19 20:35:05 Fox news is talking about ginger bread boys and girls... rather than the unilateral executive action outlawing bump stocks. 

Are we in the upside-down?
863 2018-12-19 20:35:02 We have phage stocks that have been around for years (since Britt's postdoc I think!) in the fridge in the dark. They're in cryovials.
864 2018-12-19 20:34:57 and they will, rapidly.  at 155% of GDP, stocks are the economy.
865 2018-12-19 20:34:51 They can oppose Trump so vigorously but not on Bump Stocks.
866 2018-12-19 20:34:49 When will Mercedes Benz do me what santa  Claus usually do to children  this season by giving them gift . I will forever remain grateful if I am gifted one from your old stocks. Thanks in anticipation.
867 2018-12-19 20:34:21 Great! #PresidentTrump  bans "Bump-Stocks" which are not "Full Auto." They allow the shooter to hold it so gently to allow the shooter to mimic a "Full Auto Shooting Sequence" not full auto! BTW a one armed guy like me could NEVER operate one, but I can a "Hell Fire Trigger".
868 2018-12-19 20:34:15 and even more important, leveraged loans, down down since the announcement, even when stocks spiked.
869 2018-12-19 20:33:55 That was the truth! It’s all about making money off of fear! But it’s ironic that Trump was the one who banned bump stocks overnight, and no outrage. How is this possible? Hypocrisy and showed that they didn’t really care. They just wanted to use fear to make money.
870 2018-12-19 20:33:47 I get that. But what is "the plan for getting the bump stocks that aren't destroyed or turned in" from the hardliners, those who will not abide???  Because they'll see this as a step toward taking their guns in the future.
871 2018-12-19 20:33:28 The only folks who benefit from bump stocks are the ammo manufacturers..

883 2018-12-19 20:31:55 Your math.
"Fungible" hardly means people can invest their rent money in #stocks - especially in an economy of little but nil-wage jobs in which people barely make ends meet as things stand.
884 2018-12-19 20:31:54 Idiots who sell their stocks on 100% expected news killed the market today.  Makes no sense.
885 2018-12-19 20:31:45 Today's 5 Min moves on #ES_F #SPY #NASDAQ #DowJones & most stocks were equivalent to avereage daily moves of the underlying. #FedDay #volatility #FederalReserve
886 2018-12-19 20:31:45 Funny how markets and individual stocks can pause like that sometimes, presenting such a clear opportunity

888 2018-12-19 20:31:38 @renegadestyle @jimcramer Stocks are done...  I cashed out---see you in a few years....
889 2018-12-19 20:31:30 What's a bigger risk to US financial system, P/Es dropping or TSY yields blowing through 30yr downtrend? Think Fed believes financial stability requires drawdown in stocks to incentivze investors to come back to bonds.
890 2018-12-19 20:31:29 Equity market sell-off is taking gold stocks with it. Some are seeing 10%+ swings from opening highs.

Building up portfolio with more buys:

$SA @ $11.95 | $GDXJ 200 @ $28.51 | $GG 500 @ $9.27 | $FCX 200 @ $10.19
891 2018-12-19 20:31:29 I don't own bump stocks. No one even needs a bump stock to shoot fast. The point is, once they start taking away rights, it is a stepping stone to take more rights away. Keep it up and our 1st will be gone. People like giving their opinions, what will you do when you can't?
892 2018-12-19 20:31:26 Explain how we get rid of bump stocks any other way, please. 

Even the NRA supports this.
893 2018-12-19 20:31:09 Banning bump stocks will do NOTHING toward gun control. You are helping to sell more of them by threatening to ban them. Think about this: stopping a burn or bruise from shooting is not a bad thing.
894 2018-12-19 20:30:59 So.............we're buying up stocks in THAT now?

Asking for @BetsyDeVosED      &   @jeffsessions_
895 2018-12-19 20:30:58 Late September I switched 75% to bonds and money market on my 401k. I heard and read “market closes at all time high” once too many times. Now the question is, when to get back into stocks?
896 2018-12-19 20:30:44 Sonic’s final smash is actually terrible. It was better in smash 4 and op in brawl, because you could take two stocks by carrying someone up after the first kill

Sonic fans are just stupid.
897 2018-12-19 20:30:43 Didn’t the nra support banning bump stocks

899 2018-12-19 20:30:26 Sorry Trump, you lost my vote and support going forward. Your view on red flag laws which violates constitutional rights and ban on bump stocks which opens an assault on 2a. Trump has become a bigger threat to the constitution than Obama, so sad.

906 2018-12-19 20:28:23 I don't know but his argument has nothing to do with the lawlessness of banning bump Stocks by regulation.

921 2018-12-19 20:25:41 we can sit around and bitch about the ban on bump stocks or we can take our weapons and take back our freedom. Otherwise what's the point the second amendment if we're not going to use our weapons to free ourselves?
922 2018-12-19 20:25:28 We been eating off stocks for 9 years straight. Investors who didn’t take profits were just being greedy

924 2018-12-19 20:25:07 I'm just here for the reversal and gold's takeoff 

Aren't stocks the sideshow to the credit market's main events, which may not like this?..then we'll see what the big talkers at the Fed do.
925 2018-12-19 20:25:05 Draining the QE artificial punchbowl will certainly expose those asset classes that are at artificial levels. And it's draining at a very measured pace with still substantial reinvestment. Stocks may be lower but are not hurt & are arguably stronger now. How is that a bad thing?

932 2018-12-19 20:23:12 @GregMannarino IF the Fed. does not hike the FFR tomorrow it will be a resounding NO CONFIDENCE vote for the "strong economy" narrative- stocks will dive. A hike here is BULLISH for stocks................  N O T....  Quit trashing MY President and go take a nap....
933 2018-12-19 20:23:09 Bump Stocks are a novelty. Unless you’re into “spray and pray” over lethal shot placement. Semi-Auto or trips are plenty if you take some time to train with your weapon.
934 2018-12-19 20:23:08 Personally would like to see another class of weapons added for things like bump stocks and whatever else they decide to ban. It allows citizens to still purchase, but much more extensive checks on the people purchasing them.

942 2018-12-19 20:21:50 @realDonaldTrump I sincerely wish you would reconsider your ban on bump stocks. They do not turn weapons into machine guns. You are blowing political capital with 2A supporters. NOT WHAT YOU PROMISED!
943 2018-12-19 20:21:47 Ban bump stocks. They’re stupid. #theNRAsucks
944 2018-12-19 20:21:25 @LizClaman watched entire fed brief, no once did I hear the chairman say ‘despite what Trump said’! But I am watching the market dump due to chairman announcement.  I should have dumped my stocks in Oct b4 Dems winning house purse in November.

952 2018-12-19 20:19:33 #Powell is just not getting it. The economy is not at a stage for another #rate raise. Negative #stocks move will continue. I really miss #Janet_Yellen.
953 2018-12-19 20:19:20 Market is disappointed with Powell's comment that adjusting the pace of #Fed balance sheet reduction is not an option at this time. The sudden decline in stocks and bond yields showed the market may be signaling a desire to slow down the pace of balance sheet normalization.
954 2018-12-19 20:18:29 Good ? I’m guessing highly correlated with large cap dividend? Would have to run the #s. VTI would be my default for US Stocks.

958 2018-12-19 20:18:09 The problem is there are a. Lot of stocks that are 30-50% off their highs so this pull back is hurting a ton. If just in $spy that’s fine but dam there are a lot of stocks significantly down
959 2018-12-19 20:17:56 As a financial advisor, I would have members of my ward come and sit by me at ward parties and functions. My true friends genuinely wanted to talk and chat and have a good laugh. Those with alterior motives started asking me about which stocks and bonds they should buy. 
960 2018-12-19 20:17:44 Bump stocks are shit...burn them!!!
961 2018-12-19 20:17:28 1. Two thirds of those are suicides

2. I'd wager almost none of those are bump stocks

3. Guns are used more frequently in self defense than in violent crimes

4. Countries who've banned guns have a comparable overall murder rate because murderers resort to stabbing/bludgeoning
962 2018-12-19 20:17:28 $GS at an uptrend stretching back to 2008 low.

$DJIA even with 2018 low in early February.  

If no bounce here, then there may *finally* be a bit of panic selling.  It'd be about damn time.  Hadn't been any since early Feb.  Stocks moderately oversold on short-term basis only.
963 2018-12-19 20:17:22 Wonder who dumped stocks right before the Fed announcement?
964 2018-12-19 20:17:16 DOW down +/- 300 points. 
The good news for the richest 10% of Americans (who own 84% of all stocks) is that the Republican party & Trump gave them all a huge early Christmas present with the #GOPTaxScam!
We the other 90% of Americans will lose our Social Security to pay for it!
965 2018-12-19 20:17:14 Small Drug Stocks Near-Term Outlook Positive, Despite Headwinds
966 2018-12-19 20:16:49 I agree. Bump stocks are worthless and dangerous. I agree that they should be banned
967 2018-12-19 20:16:38 #Powell just walked back his comment about the Fed's funds rate being just below neutral.  He said we are just below the "lower range of neutral." That is a very bearish clarification for stocks, and America's bubble economy.

971 2018-12-19 20:15:46 Today we learned that the Fed is not there to put a floor under your stocks... They have stepped away after catching you with every little stumble the last 10 years.
972 2018-12-19 20:15:40 Don't forget. Every time @RampCapitalLLC screams about the markets, it means that it's time to buy some stocks that you've been eyeing, at a discount!
973 2018-12-19 20:15:36 President trump why are you taking our bump stocks away from the good people when crooks when crooks will get the anyway
974 2018-12-19 20:15:32 Welp, thanks to the market sell-off after #theFed announcing a 1/4 pt. hike and trimming 2019  forecast, I might be able to buy some stocks for a late holiday season bargain. I just don't know who I should buy. #nyse #nasdaq
975 2018-12-19 20:15:21 The point is, something that was once illegal is now legal. times change. nothing is set in stone. the amendments were written in 1791.. you think they had bump stocks back then? No. Assault rifles were deemed unlawful over 30 years ago. Noone is taking ur right to bear arms away
976 2018-12-19 20:14:56 So, Q would say... restructure the Fed.  Gold is coming back.  As for me I've lost a bundle. Maybe look into who these people are that are DUMPING STOCKS to hurt the growth that the President started.  My 401k lost 100k since September and I'm a safe investor - or so I thought
977 2018-12-19 20:14:36 What do when gold and stocks fall at the same time? Please send help.
978 2018-12-19 20:14:33 #Powell: 2017 was a year of synchronized global growth. In 2018, still healthy level of global growth, but not that strong as 2017

984 2018-12-19 20:13:58 Fed Day: I saw what I wanted to see - lower rate hike expectations, lower inflation rates. That is great for stocks. THEN, Powell starts to talk. I have ZERO confidence in him. He is like a deer in headlights - out of touch. Scary.
985 2018-12-19 20:13:45 Stocks were up on the anticipation of #TheFed announcement.  When I saw the interest rates were increasing, I said to myself the stocks are going to plummet. So far, it’s happening.

988 2018-12-19 20:13:33 Its pretty unlikely that CaLPERS bought only 1,600 shares of $TLRY($100B entities don't buy $200K of stocks) so assume they bought more during 4th Q.  Euphemistically speaking, that sucks.  Stock was $164+ on Oct 1 and even w/impeccable timing they are likely getting smoked.
989 2018-12-19 20:13:14 Waiting for anti-fascists to be upset about Trump banning bump stocks.

Oh wait...
990 2018-12-19 20:12:57 A2: (2/2) Through the course of the year(s), this 80/20 mix could get out of alignment based on how investments perform – say it goes to 90% stocks and 10% bonds. “Rebalancing” takes you back to your 80/20 target. #creditchat
991 2018-12-19 20:12:56 Fed just made inverted US yields worse. I’d expect major selling in stocks in near future as Fed continues to ignore the flashing warning signs.
992 2018-12-19 20:12:55 See I haven’t really seen anything from either side at this point. I’m interested to know what people think. The right is opposed to any sort of gun reform due to it potentially causing a ‘slippery slope’ while the left has been all for banning bump stocks...
993 2018-12-19 20:12:46 Lolol so you don’t trade stocks on Wall Street, you play around with investing on a very limited platform(not shitting on Robinhood or investing). Don’t lie lol. You’ve probably been getting killed these last few months like everyone else
994 2018-12-19 20:12:43 Because people worship Trump. They have lost all objectivity in politics. They will now defend whatever he does. I started pulling back when I seen he was worshipped like he was God, and now he banned bump stocks. The beginning of the infringement on the 2A.
995 2018-12-19 20:12:41 A2: (1/2) Making sure your investment mix matches your financial needs/goals. For example, let’s say based on time horizon and risk profile you have a “Growth Allocation” of 80% stocks and 20% bonds. #creditchat
996 2018-12-19 20:12:41 Starting to like Powell more & more. Finally someone who doesn't cave to the greed on Wall St. Message is basically we told you stocks were overvalued, you were dumb enough to buy the top. Not here to bail you out. Still looking for 2% inflation and raising to combat a recession.
997 2018-12-19 20:12:39 With stocks = 150% GDP, is there any difference? I don't believe Powell is so noble personally, far from it.
998 2018-12-19 20:12:38 My #cryptocurrencies are more stable today than stocks in the #djia
999 2018-12-19 20:12:33 This Fed Chair sounds like he doesn't know what he's talking about - confidence at the podium is not giving me confidence to hold stocks. @realDonaldTrump  well done you have single handedly F'd the economy DOW 400 down and this is the worst december since the great depression.
1000 2018-12-19 20:12:25 @BullDozee @Drpizzza7 sold some shares today moving money into better acting stocks vs the market could be a long time till Apple moves up

1002 2018-12-19 20:12:13 I do find it interesting that there are numerous signs of economic slow down and they still raised rates.  Even $FDX saying there is a slowdown is a good barometer.  #stocks

1007 2018-12-19 20:11:49 Personally I have preferred rules set on Battlefield 3 stocks 7 minutes and only use Background Matchmaking. I get my rules most of the time. Sometimes FD or 2 stocks. Very rare I get FFA. Haven't seen one since the patch.
1008 2018-12-19 20:11:47 At work today I asked a barista at @Starbucks for a cup of water. She said okay and totally didn’t make it she actually walked out and left me hanging. Not only do I spent almost $60 a week there, I also invest a lot of my hard earn money in the Starbucks stocks. Terrible!

1012 2018-12-19 20:11:17 oil long and stocks short cancelling out, for now
1013 2018-12-19 20:11:15 Of course.
#Stocks long were a bubble.
Stocks couldn't sustainably keep rising while incomes were near-flat and a high percent of working aged incomes nil any more than house prices could.
1014 2018-12-19 20:11:13 @jimcramer You r the man Cramer. Stocks are lower than they were 3weeks ago like you predicted.  Powell shut up and get off the podium.
1015 2018-12-19 20:11:03 he's totally ice-cold emotionally......hope Trump takes him down fast in 2019.....he does not realize as stocks crash 30% so will US economy and jobs
1016 2018-12-19 20:11:01 Auto weapon ban is open for debate. Banning bump stocks is the smart move.
1017 2018-12-19 20:11:00 Stocks dont reflect or effect most people's economic situation.  Hate to break it to you.
1018 2018-12-19 20:10:52 the moves in some of these huge market cap stocks is amazing.
1019 2018-12-19 20:10:47 bump-stocks actually saved lives in the Vegas massacre
1020 2018-12-19 20:10:32 Yup, that's how it's done. Also the bump stocks can be 3D printed.

1023 2018-12-19 20:10:16 Them talking about a stabilizing "market" and people investing in stocks and their retirement, when people can't even make rent is the definition of cognitive dissonance. Then again it is coming from corporate media - @AliVelshi & @SRuhle who believe the national "Debt" farce.

1027 2018-12-19 20:09:40 As of yesterday, the Stock Market experienced the worst December since the Great Depression. 
Not to mention, we're on track for the worst quarter since 2008. 
Let that sink in. 
December Stocks after close yesterday:
Dow = -8.6% (-508)
S&P = -8.7%
NASQ = -9.2%

1031 2018-12-19 20:09:19 The market has NO confidence in Fed. Chair Powell. Stocks were higher after the hike announcement HOWEVER. the more Powell talks the lower stocks are going. Wow.
1032 2018-12-19 20:09:17 #Stocks are dropping big because stocks were long a bubble.
Stocks couldn't sustainably soar while incomes available for buying them weren't - and many incomes were near flat - any more than house prices could.

1034 2018-12-19 20:09:00 The Fed presents a reasonable approach to interest rates going forward and the stock market has a knee jerk tantrum! Idiotic and robotic program selling kicks in with no stops. This is likely a huge buying opportunity! #DOW #Stocks
1035 2018-12-19 20:08:52 Bump stocks are not machine guns. 
Plain and simple!

1037 2018-12-19 20:08:45 i think almost every time Powell has spoke mkts have tanked #fed #Stocks Guy is so clueless - wait till Economy grinds to halt cause of him. This is the JPowell crash he started in Oct
1038 2018-12-19 20:08:45 That this was ever a thing, where congress people could buy or sell stocks for businesses they make laws for, is insane!!! OF COURSE they shouldn't be able to do this @SenSherrodBrown and @JeffMerkley!!!
1039 2018-12-19 20:08:42 Giving credit where it is due, the president banning bump stocks is a really good thing. Although I wonder if he thought he was banning "bum socks" and will tweet that "the homeless need to buy their own socks! Wasteful spending. NO COLLUSION!" He don't read good. #SmockingGun

Yet $VIX fear gauge also DOWN & remains < 25 level — scary data point for #stocks — means still no excessive fear typically present when a bottom is near.

1047 2018-12-19 20:08:16 Bump Stock Ban:
1) Don't believe it just because the media says it.
2) If it is true he is giving the idiots something for something else.
3) Bump Stocks are stupid and tactically useless.
1048 2018-12-19 20:08:14 RIP bump stocks, you were fucking unnecessary.
1049 2018-12-19 20:08:03 Do bump stocks serve any other purpose than to burn ammo and burn through rifle barrels that are not milled to machine gun specs?

1056 2018-12-19 20:07:21 That's, ok, stop spending money on these companies, their stocks won't be worth buying.  The people have the power to end all this shit boycott GM boycott, Facebook, boycott Twitter boycott google ......  End it all, hit the streets. #YellowVests
1057 2018-12-19 20:07:17 My suspicion is that saying that rates were now within the neutral range was meant to be perceived as very dovish; I don't think Powell intended his comments on QT to be as hawkish as they're being perceived. (That's what seems to have started stocks selling again)

1113 2018-12-19 20:00:52 Eyeball your local economy.
How much of it is of nil-wage jobs that won't even arguably allow anyone to invest in #stocks?  
Add the bubble reality of stocks soaring while wages haven't - even for good-wage jobs - and the stock collapse was unavoidable.
1114 2018-12-19 20:00:52 The betrayal by the @gop and @realDonaldTrump is complete.  Maybe @PressSec can explain how "I'm proud to shut down the government" became "I'll sign a bill with no #BorderWall funding" in a week.

Plus letting criminals out early and banning bump stocks as guns.

#MAGA my ass.

The market was expecting a hike, but was hoping they would remove the language 'further gradual increases needed' and remove 2019 hikes. Neither happened. Stocks have turned negative, while Bonds are improving.
1147 2018-12-19 19:55:13 A slow reacting #FED means equities are in deep deep trouble! Powell won’t give stocks more QE “drugs” $ES_F
1148 2018-12-19 19:55:11 We just ask our accountant on Friday about recession havens.  He recommended bonds. When stocks are low bonds are not. Visa versa.  We are also putting money net into real estate.  Cash is always a good bet
1149 2018-12-19 19:55:05 U.S. stocks pared gains on Wednesday, with the #Nasdaq index turning negative, after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates but forecast fewer rate hikes for 2019.
1150 2018-12-19 19:54:27 Unless you have unlimited supply of barrels buffers etc , bump stocks are useless is an easy way to screw up your AR .
1151 2018-12-19 19:54:25 #Powell: strong forecast for next year between 2 to 2.5%. That is a strong growth forecast
#interestrates #stocks #currencies #forex #alpari
1152 2018-12-19 19:54:25 Hence markets will freak out. 2 hikes Fed says, market says 0. Nothing put out today including his talk is bullish for stocks 3-6 months out. Nothing.
1153 2018-12-19 19:54:13 i need the market to come down so I can buy more stocks
1154 2018-12-19 19:53:52 Not if he keeps banning things like bump stocks. Its unconstitutional. He will lose alot of his base starting with me.
1155 2018-12-19 19:53:38 Not sure... But I do know that the guy who called the collapse well before it happened is urging everyone to buy stocks in water.
1156 2018-12-19 19:53:32 Agree: outside of treasuries, utilities stocks, consumer staples and sin stocks (alcohol, beer, cigarettes).
1157 2018-12-19 19:53:32 Stocks at the lows. S&P 500 down 21 points
1158 2018-12-19 19:53:14 Can someone tell me how Potus picked fed chairman Powell? What is wrong with him, and half the members? No inflation , yet they hike rates, and continue to for the sake of doing so. In the interim destroying the economy, and stocks!
1159 2018-12-19 19:52:59 Stocks at the lows. S&P 500 down 21 points
1160 2018-12-19 19:52:46 I never liked bump stocks. They are “finicky”, and difficult to keep your lead on target.
1161 2018-12-19 19:52:21 Plus the 15 ton elephant in the room, what bump stocks are being used for in a few instances. I agree the AR15 should be able to legally be owned but that bump stock being used in school shootings is just horrific and kind of forced the hand of the government
1162 2018-12-19 19:51:48 Bump stocks have been used for a grand total of ONE time in a mass shooting.
The ban is empty - we need to separate crazies from firearms.
It’s NOT the fault of the #NRA - so stop the partisan hack attacks.

How many #NRA members have been trigger-pullers in mass shootings?

ZERO
1163 2018-12-19 19:51:33 Stocks do not like Powell's comments, with S&P breaking support on the weekly chart going back to Sept 2017. A couple weekly closes like this and the bull market is over. A new downtrend will have possibly started, at least temporarily. #bad $SPY $DJIA
1164 2018-12-19 19:51:22 it's not just oil.  When broad range of commodities all go in the same direction, people have historically associated this with change in economic direction. Unlike stocks and bonds, physical commodities are consumed. When prices are falling, demands/growth must be falling.
1165 2018-12-19 19:51:01 I have no problems with people owning guns. I come from a gun family. All my family and others want is just sensible gun laws. And that whole gun for self defense is a poor argument. If you think banning bump stocks equates to banning guns/stripping your rights, your delusional.
1166 2018-12-19 19:50:42 Stocks down a wee bit for the day, after being up strongly pre-announcement, but if anything I'm surprised they're not down more given a somewhat less dovish tone people seemed to be getting ready for.
1167 2018-12-19 19:50:39 2 more hikes will cause housing collapse, stocks down 30%, major recession in 2019......happy Powell is a disaster for US jobs, workers, wages, companies......needs to be removed soon by Trump
1168 2018-12-19 19:50:30 Bump stocks should never have been sold
1169 2018-12-19 19:50:12 Bear Market = Buying Opportunity! Stocks are on sale!
1170 2018-12-19 19:50:03 How about you talk about Trump banning bump stocks and making them illegal?
1171 2018-12-19 19:49:50 In regards to International stocks, do you think they outperformed from 2001-2007 because of the China effect/bubble?
1172 2018-12-19 19:49:31 I’m getting 52 week low notifications from stocks I follow on Robinhood like every 5 minutes. 

That seems good.
1173 2018-12-19 19:49:29 This is also a call-out post for those of you who hold direct stocks in bad actors.
Divest!
1174 2018-12-19 19:49:25 Attention bears...

@federalreserve 2019 forecast

 GDP grows 2.3%
 Unemployment falls farther 

Selling stocks today because you think recession unfolds next year is out of step with current data and Fed forecast.
1175 2018-12-19 19:49:12 Stocks fall back into positive territory.
1176 2018-12-19 19:49:09 Further to this: “That amount would increase non-linearly the further stocks fell”
What is the mechanism tying stock prices to tax receipts?
1177 2018-12-19 19:49:03 @Poundland please can you stock the gingerbread hot chocolate all year round? No one else stocks it and I love it and cannot wait for Christmas every year 
1178 2018-12-19 19:48:49 #stocks bounce around as #Fed chair speaks after  .25% rate hike #Dow down 98 @KNX1070 @Radiodotcom @MottekOnMoney
1179 2018-12-19 19:48:47 In line with banning bump stocks it’s a last ditch attempt to accumulate points for his base. Far too late and your treasonous acts will not be masked by anything you do going forward @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
1180 2018-12-19 19:48:39 Bump stocks of bump stocks
1181 2018-12-19 19:48:12 #Powell: inflation undershoots are not desirable. Rate very close to 2%. The aim is to be symmetrically around 2%

1182 2018-12-19 19:47:58 We're only as good as stocks we trade.  Limited focus abilities. Spent most mental resources exclusively on MU, missed dump in FB that covertly began yday afternoon... and traded technically lower after taking out todays open for the dump at 140
1183 2018-12-19 19:47:31 Yes.
Are bump stocks useless? It seems like they probably are pretty close to that.

Would I own one? Probably not.

Do I support your right to own one? Damn skippy, I do.
1184 2018-12-19 19:47:28 Not true.  I just said he was right in stopping bump stocks.  And it's not just me, military officials are almost universally saying it's a mistake.  Worry about them, not me.
1185 2018-12-19 19:47:28 It's all about accuracy ... Fuck Bump Stocks 
1186 2018-12-19 19:47:05 I think it really hit people that Powell comes across as a very competent steward of the economy and that he doesn't care about stocks beyond making sure he takes the bubble out of valuations.  Short, short, short. It's over.
1187 2018-12-19 19:47:04 Unless your home is being attacked by a small army bump stocks are worthless! I support the ban!!
1188 2018-12-19 19:46:53 A lot more content during the civil war there were tons of weapon customisation 8 round cylinders Sniper like Barrels on Revolvers and Riffle stocks on revolvers
1189 2018-12-19 19:46:44 #Powell: no political considerations in determining the monetary policy
#interestrates #stocks #currencies #forex #alpari
1190 2018-12-19 19:46:36 The US deficit is running at a $1.8T annualized rate during the 2 mths stocks were down (Oct-Nov).  That amount would increase non-linearly the further stocks fell, & then would require the absorption of EM selling as well.
1191 2018-12-19 19:46:28 Bump stocks are a joke. No practical use.
1192 2018-12-19 19:46:18 Cheap stocks aren't good and Good stocks aren't cheap.
1193 2018-12-19 19:46:16 #Powell: there has been a sense of concern among business people about global growth. 
#interestrates #stocks #currencies #forex #alpari
1194 2018-12-19 19:46:15 I own CAFOM (turnaround) and Venteunique (GARP). Down bad, really bad (bt CAFOM 3-4x ex problem earnings). Looking restaurant growth stocks, Telepizza, Domino's UK. Sub 15x PERs bt consumer discretionary spend might looks to dive so somewhat illusionary.
1195 2018-12-19 19:46:14 Then again, #stocks sell off anew when Powell effectively says "Forget it" RE: any change to net $50B/month balance sheet reduction
1196 2018-12-19 19:46:10 I noticed very low stocks of corned beef and fray bentos pies in Morrisons today in Fakenham.   Just think fray bentos could define the course of U.K. history.  Or maybe May had ordered two giant container ships of the stuff already so see us through the dark times.
1197 2018-12-19 19:45:42 U.S. stocks turned negative after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight lending rate for the fourth time in 2018 and signaled it was still on track for gradual increases ahead, disappointing investors.

The Fed needs to chill. The market is now becoming illiquid...
1198 2018-12-19 19:45:29 Are people dumping stocks because of what Powell said about the balance sheet? I'm surprised anyone would think that's a lever that's going to be pulled.
1199 2018-12-19 19:45:17 It may well be the only medicine once the stocks run out after a no deal Brexit because of course UK’s participation in the European regulatory network would simply cease. 

So to ensure continuing supply we’d need to create our own regulatory framework. From scratch
1200 2018-12-19 19:45:04 What do you mean his tone is off? Why are bump stocks bans bad, seems logical. I like the corporate tax cuts those make sense, the other tax cuts don’t. Pulling out the Iran nuclear deal and pushing for nato to chip in more.
1201 2018-12-19 19:44:52 Oil and gas stocks showing major strength. Short opportunity?

1203 2018-12-19 19:44:45 Basically Fed's are saying " NO SANTA FOR YOU, GO TO HELL". The fact that they want markets to slide into recession across the world now is really quite puzzling, specially after stocks already lost between 20% to 50% from their HIGHS. REALLY STRANGE OUTCOME! !

1207 2018-12-19 19:44:02 The Damascus Securities Exchange opens Sunday to Thursday and on each day, stocks can only increase in value up to a maximum of five percent from the previous day and can only decrease in value down to a maximum of two percent from the previous day.
1208 2018-12-19 19:43:51 Today I received the #dividend from my $SHELL stocks, paid it out in cash, reinvested in my main fund. Due to the current powerplays of the world economies I think it's safer to invest in funds than in single stocks.
1209 2018-12-19 19:43:26 I think Stacy possesses bump stocks ....send the NJ State Police
1210 2018-12-19 19:43:15 Stayed w/stocks through the slide. It was hard -they lost 3/4 of their value at the worst. Most of my stocks pay dividends so the pain was mitigated somewhat. Now it’s muni bonds for me-they rarely default. Or $$$. Never, ever metals. I’m a cons investor

1223 2018-12-19 19:41:21 Bump stocks are dumb. My only problem is with how they’re being banned. What’s to stop a different administration from doing the same thing with semi autos?
1224 2018-12-19 19:41:21 OK, so what is the objection to the ban on bump stocks??? Why would anyone ever need a bump stock for legal use in the first place??
1225 2018-12-19 19:41:16 Good call earlier. Feels like the only stocks up today are companies buying back their stock in thin trading. I see the 10 year going to 2.4-2.5 real quick here and we will be inverted. They are blind
1226 2018-12-19 19:41:06 Survivorship bias is a feature of cap weighted indices. The S&P500 is similar to a momentum strategy with rising stocks emphasized and underperformers fading away. It’s a rotating cast of characters.
1227 2018-12-19 19:40:58 Why do you sell off penny stocks on fed. That’s just funny.
1228 2018-12-19 19:40:54 Pulling out of Syria and banning bump stocks all in the same day. (Rare applause). Trump’s base may actually stop to think for a moment. (Nah, probably not). You know this wasn’t well thought out because they didn’t try to bury this by announcing over the weekend.
1229 2018-12-19 19:40:28 Oh right, the part of me disagreeing with Trumps decision on removing bump-stocks. Yeah, I still believe that was against the 2nd amendment.
1230 2018-12-19 19:40:28 Had many stocks in bullish watchlist, but sentiments tomorrow will be mixed specially considering announcement from US that 2 more fed hikes in next year!!
1231 2018-12-19 19:40:03 Banning bump stocks? Giving employees Christmas Eve off? Granting a visa for that dying boy’s mom? Did someone’s cold Grinch heart grow two sizes this holiday season??

1242 2018-12-19 19:38:33 I don't remember many conservatives saying bump stocks shouldn't be banned and making a big outcry about it. Especially people who actually know what a bumpstock does.
1243 2018-12-19 19:38:13 #bonds FED statement makes it clear that FED wants full yield curve inversion: in plain English, they seek a recession to preclude the risk of inflation, which tends to materialize at the end of the business cycle.

1251 2018-12-19 19:36:30 Baffling that folks on the right are not just fine with, but supportive of Trumps ban on bump stocks.

1255 2018-12-19 19:35:40 @POTUS Mr. President, first Merry Christmas to you and your family. Bad idea banning bump stocks. We the law biding citizens feel like we have been betrayed. I do not know yet what I will do in 2020, I may just set out.
1256 2018-12-19 19:35:18 @federalreserve What are you stupid? Stock markets suffered since September to ten year lows on a number of benchmarks because of your traitorous actions. @realDonaldTrump How would stocks have performed if we issued our own money?

1274 2018-12-19 19:32:57 Most gun owners and Republicans could care less about bump stocks because they do nothing for you other than waste your ammo and make you much less accurate. We also don't care because you can literally make a bumpstock with a belt so a ban won't even do anything.
1275 2018-12-19 19:32:38 GBP/USD fell around 50 pips after expected fed reserve interest hike and upgrades to growth forecasts.

1277 2018-12-19 19:32:26 We waited a 13% correction in stocks & 1 year for the Fed to tell us some cross currents have emerged. 200 PhDs in the house have finally gotten it.
1278 2018-12-19 19:32:22 Stocks don’t define neutral rate.
1279 2018-12-19 19:32:03 Trump is coming after their bump stocks. #justsaying
1280 2018-12-19 19:31:50 To be honest, things whose sole purpose is to break the law should be outlawed

Bump stocks only exist to make a weapon fully automatic. 
Radar detectors exist only to allow drivers to speed

What other purpose do they serve?
1281 2018-12-19 19:31:49 @realDonaldTrump  not that you care but you lost all my respect and support by your action on bump stocks and then caving on border wall.  Not gonna vote for you again
1282 2018-12-19 19:31:47 Discussions on TV about is the economy good or bad 'today' are somewhat nonsensical. Recessions don't show up instantly. Ideally, GDP will slow gradually over 12 mos. Far better than slamming into a wall suddenly with panic sales of stocks, homes, assets. Normal macro cycle.
1283 2018-12-19 19:31:46 Stocks down, USD rose. Pretty much correlated.
1284 2018-12-19 19:31:36 Does “cross currents” mean worst December for stocks since Great Depression? #Powell #Fed #FOMC
1285 2018-12-19 19:31:22 Now see Donny does it not feel good to work with everyone, be truthful , and come up with good legislation that will stand up! This crime bill is good, banning bump stocks is good. You can do it Donny, keep doing your homework however.
1286 2018-12-19 19:31:13 It's a shame we've abandoned the stocks as a form of punishment.
1287 2018-12-19 19:30:54 No wall and banning bump stocks. Wow Trump support is going to be dropping biggley.  This will take a sledgehammer to his core supporters!
1288 2018-12-19 19:30:42 Back to the Kylie and Jay Z comparison. I don’t think anyone is dismissing Kylie hard work. But we are starting to realize the jump to wealth when you better prepare your children for it. Kane has a 529 now and when he turns five he will have stocks of his own.

1291 2018-12-19 19:29:36 If the fed look at this from strictly data and the economy. There is zero reason to not hike. Unemployment at all time low, gdp at high, inflation is moderately low. Plus Powell is not a dove. He believes the free market (stocks) will find its true price no matter where rates at.
1292 2018-12-19 19:29:36 Based on the Fed's not so dovish statement:  My guess is for higher Tbond prices and lower stocks.   Added another tranche of TLT.  Stocks very oversold but any rally may be used for selling or shorting.   Long TLT

1295 2018-12-19 19:29:25 oh it's an email about bump stocks, okay
1296 2018-12-19 19:29:14 I mean to stocks + market volatility. And ya life just steadily becoming more expensive :'(
1297 2018-12-19 19:29:04 The Federal Open Market Committee raised the fed funds rate 25 basis points to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%., prompting a selloff in stocks as some had harboured hopes the Fed may pause on hikes in the wake of recent market volatility
1298 2018-12-19 19:28:43 Now we do dollar up, 10-year down and stocks up for maximum fuckery and it is a year for the ages!
1299 2018-12-19 19:28:38 Bump stocks were created to mimic the rate of fire of a machine gun as an end run on the automatic weapons ban.  

I completely support this ban.
1300 2018-12-19 19:28:29 You know what's a "terrible mistake"? Banning bump stocks while having a @GOP controlled House, Senate and White House, but not passing NATIONAL CONCEALED CARRY RECIPROCITY. I hope all of you get "Primaried" in the next election. Bunch of lying RINO's.
1301 2018-12-19 19:28:17 Why are all the liberals not praising trump.  I am surprised liberals are not for bump stocks since trump is against and by definition they hate trump so much #bumpstocks #maga
1302 2018-12-19 19:27:55 Does Stocks not see they are parked in front of Baskin Robbins?

Be careful
1305 2018-12-19 19:27:23 If just going off stocks, then yes.  But the mkt is telling him he's making a policy mistake.  If he was clued in to what's happening to ISM, what's about to happen to ISM, inflation coming off, housing, credit mkts, there's no reason to not hold off today.
1306 2018-12-19 19:27:08 my stocks need a bump, boss.
1307 2018-12-19 19:27:06 yes, but only the stocks that are going to go up.
1308 2018-12-19 19:26:38 Good job! We don’t need ‘bump stocks’. But remember this all #progressive #liberal #democrats - this was done by @GOP controlled @TheJusticeDept and @realDonaldTrump. Never done by @BarackObama or @TheDemocrats . Who do you think is really in the #Elites pocket?
1309 2018-12-19 19:26:01 Cycle of operation from a closed bolt rifle: Firing, Unlocking, Extracting, Ejecting, Cocking, Feeding, Chambering & Locking. Since bump stocks a bad for aiming. Whats the status of 3 round burst. Burst would be more of a semi-auto rifle by definition. One trigger pull 3 rounds.
1310 2018-12-19 19:25:25 FED raises rates - stocks, bonds, FX, metals, all react except bitcoin. Good to have 0 correlation with traditional markets, #bitcoin
1311 2018-12-19 19:25:02 I can help you out. I have a schpiel I give to youngins that finally have enough to sock away. And it's flexible enough to avoid stocks if you don't want to invest in those.
1312 2018-12-19 19:24:55 To fk Trump and kill our stocks, 401’s etc.  criminal

1314 2018-12-19 19:24:37 Crude is actually higher now than before the announcement; yet Oil stocks lower w/ market
1315 2018-12-19 19:24:35 Finally, some good news and legislation. The passage of the Crime Bill, and ban on Bump Stocks will have positive impacts on societies health, safety, lives and family structures. Legislation should save lives/help and encourage good societal behavior.
1316 2018-12-19 19:24:29 No. Bump stocks are not Constitutionally guarantee.
1317 2018-12-19 19:24:19 Stocks give up gains after Fed raises rates
1318 2018-12-19 19:24:19 Fed mostly sticks to its guns, stocks head lower
1319 2018-12-19 19:24:08 It was a thread. I was referring to bump stocks. Of course people use ar15 for legit purposes. I meant you can’t extend that to bump stocks
1320 2018-12-19 19:24:02 Never said we was at war with anyone. Obama almost brought us into another depression. Stocks? People are making lots of money. Stocks keep rising look at all the jobs Trump have created as well. At that he stopped giving money to the middle east, AND NK.
1321 2018-12-19 19:23:52 "this is good for bank stocks"

???
1322 2018-12-19 19:23:25 If the citizens of New Jersey didnt turn in 1 now illegal magazine then i highly doubt the people of the US will turn in the bump stocks either
1323 2018-12-19 19:23:23 Remember when a few years back, Democrats and Obama tried to ban bump stocks and Republicans went nuts and freaked out and it was called a joke and they had no clue what they were doing....well trump just set a ban on them sooooo where’s your outcry now?
1324 2018-12-19 19:23:11 As a firearms owner, I support banning devices like bump stocks that convert semi-automatic weapons into automatic weapons.  This, we agree, however, I am not a fan of laws that ban semi-automatic weapons or otherwise "infringe" upon the 2nd Amendment for law-abiding citizens.
1325 2018-12-19 19:23:06 THEY CAN BE USED TO HIDE BUMP STOCKS!!!!!!
1326 2018-12-19 19:22:25 CIBC: #Fed statement added a specific reference to monitoring global economic and financial market developments, "showing its well aware that #stocks are down and non-US data have weakened, and that these could delay further hikes at some point" #USeconomy #markets
1327 2018-12-19 19:22:21 @ReformedBroker Trouble was we didn’t have a barbell approach to the dovish rate hike. That’s why stocks are down!

1329 2018-12-19 19:22:08 Banning bump stocks and hug-a-thug policies, if this is winning I want no part of it. Trump needs to remember what got him where he is.

1331 2018-12-19 19:21:49 No stocks are down because they are priced for much more growth than 2.5% and are finally coming to the realization that excessive monetary and fiscal stimulus is not permanent.
1332 2018-12-19 19:21:40 I am grateful that @realDonaldTrump has urged the ban of bump stocks.  Best decision if his administration. @NRA #Parkland @ATFHQ @GOPChairwoman @VP @senatemajldr @MomsDemand
1333 2018-12-19 19:21:28 Was that just the last relief / exit rally? I think I’m ready to capitulate too. Stocks are def going to get much worse!

1335 2018-12-19 19:20:57 I know this. Bump stocks will not kill you.
1336 2018-12-19 19:20:54 Your are being very hyperbolic. It is only a tiny percentage that have any desire to arm teachers. Just like there were only a tiny percentage that were against banning bump stocks... which you seem unwilling to discuss since Trump signed the ban.
1337 2018-12-19 19:20:47 I am anti authoritarian right or left. And bump stocks shouldn't be thought of as a 2A issue, but a 5A issue. It is private property being demanded to be destroyed or turned over without compensation. Legally purchased plastic that can potentially make me a felon. Tyrannical.
1338 2018-12-19 19:20:45 What's interesting is the ATF under Obama looked at bump stocks and decided they didn't fit the definiton of a machine gun (fires more than one round per trigger pull)
1339 2018-12-19 19:20:39 Put your retirement funds in stocks they said. 
Then you'll have enough money for retirement they said.
Bullshit I say!
1340 2018-12-19 19:20:37 The Marx Brothers made so much money in Vaudeville in 1920s they couldn't spend it all. Someone suggested stocks, so they put their money in the market. At the crash, they went broke. "No one told us stocks could go down!" Groucho growled. So they had to make movies . . .

1342 2018-12-19 19:20:18 The Fed wants to get to 3% because they think that is neutral. They are wrong however.  Neutral is at 2.5%. That's why stocks are going down. Powell is wrong. There is no need for further hikes. Nor is inflation going higher.
1343 2018-12-19 19:20:16 Stocks bouncing with USD rising.
1344 2018-12-19 19:20:06 In '99 I had a conversation with some young mousse head brokers who were making ridiculous money trading dotcom stocks. I said how are these going to ever make money? I was told numbers didn't matter. That they were the old paradigm.
I lost track of them shortly thereafter
1345 2018-12-19 19:20:01 You either led your audience to buy every non-dip in stocks for the last 3 months ...

Or you had them rotating into Treasuries when Bond Kings were scaring them away 

$TLT $SHY
1346 2018-12-19 19:19:49 Hamilton you clearly don’t understand. It won’t stop at bump stocks. It’s a step based system. First it’s the bumpstocks, then it moves towards the guns themselves. Plus uninformed morons banning things has never been my cup of tea
1347 2018-12-19 19:19:44 Amir TVIX is one of those stocks that you don’t recommend trading if you are a beginner? Like you were saying yesterday TSLA, TLRY, NVDA... Thank you
1348 2018-12-19 19:19:30 During the Great Recession dollar store stocks did well. And Gold did ok for a short time but I think the high was like 16 or 1800 before coming down to about current levels and not really doing much. Cash was king though.
1349 2018-12-19 19:19:28 What's your favorite stock for 120? Just got into it and currently testing everything out. Any differences between stocks for 35 vs 120?
1350 2018-12-19 19:19:27 look at the moves in some of these stocks, 4 points down for $AAPL, 3 1/2 for $QQQ, 8+ for $BA. 5 for $NVDA and the $IWM, 3.  the buyers walked away, those with catch bids will do well.
1351 2018-12-19 19:19:17 Stream too bearish for where initial conditions are wrt stocks.
1352 2018-12-19 19:19:13 If stocks come back from this it will be super bullish.. buy the close above 2567
1353 2018-12-19 19:19:06 Following the ban on bump stocks? @TheJusticeDept did not publish the rule in today's Federal Register.
The ban does not go into effect until 90 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register.
1354 2018-12-19 19:18:51 Are these coolers made with melted down bump stocks?
1355 2018-12-19 19:18:49 If $FDX has you thinking we are in a rather sudden global slowdown, what cyclical stocks are still timely shorts here?
1356 2018-12-19 19:18:40 Started flipping houses, & that turned into stocks/bonds/trade. Then J & I started investing into other businesses that we get cut checks on.  Granted we had money to invest money. Just went from there.
1357 2018-12-19 19:18:23 When the stock market was  high and interest rates were low it was a good time to cut back on investing in stocks and use the money to pay off debt. Now that the stock market is down/flat it's a good time to start investing again but hopefully you paid off debt, rates rising
1358 2018-12-19 19:18:10 At this point if you’re still in stocks you need to hold
1359 2018-12-19 19:18:09 I’m probably one of the most pro-gun people you’ll meet, and even I can agree that bump stocks are unnecessary. If it’s illegal to own a full-auto firearm, bumpstocks should be illegal. 
1360 2018-12-19 19:17:49 Well if bump stocks don’t increase or decrease the velocity of a round, why do you care if they are banned?
1361 2018-12-19 19:17:45 If bump stocks are no big deal, what do you care if they are banned?
1362 2018-12-19 19:17:45 I don’t get much these days so bear with me. 

Had to hike to stay credible.  2 hikes 2019 down from 3 means could be 0 & likely mid year.  If they hike mid year it’s because economy & stocks pick back up.  

$tbt saying peak of rate hike cycle. Supposed to buy risk assets
1363 2018-12-19 19:17:41 I’m not sure I follow.  Over bump stocks what?
1364 2018-12-19 19:17:36 Fed increases rates. Stocks take dive.
1365 2018-12-19 19:17:20 Stupid feds increase rates. You know the we could have used a break from Trump this time. These are not normal times. Thanks idiots. #stocks
@business @cnbc @msnbc @CNNMoneyInvest
1366 2018-12-19 19:17:18 Let's see how we close this trading session. All my stocks & calls show profit. I have NO reason to sell one share. The leaders lead!
1367 2018-12-19 19:17:16 It’s also funny that “the right” isn’t going insane about Trump banning bump stocks. If it were [insert lefty politician], they would run file “full-commie trying to take the guns!!1” SAD!
1368 2018-12-19 19:17:11 Fed hikes funds rate by 1/4 point. Median down to 2 (from 3) 25bps hikes in 2019 and 1 more hike in 2020.  Fed more “dovish” but not as much as market expects so stocks give up gains. FOMC lowers median forecast for real real GDP growth and inflation slightly for 2019.
1369 2018-12-19 19:17:05 I wonder if they know how stocks work
1370 2018-12-19 19:17:04 Kill his wall and kill his economy/stocks. Ensure no re-election.

1373 2018-12-19 19:16:52 There’s a shop near mango and wheat,kanda that stocks it
1374 2018-12-19 19:16:50 Yes and it pisses me off the sorry pieces of. They are doing it as well as the corporate dumping of stocks in order to affect the stock exchange! Its a coordinated attack on Trump again! Thats why we have to stick with him tough!
1375 2018-12-19 19:16:32 So the Fed defied @realDonaldTrump and raised the benchmark rate by 1/4 percent. All major indices and stocks turned negative right after the announcement $DOW $SPX
1376 2018-12-19 19:16:14 Bump-stocks OUT (Banned by Trump administration)
1377 2018-12-19 19:16:11 IF FOMC does not hike, it disappoints, if they do hike, & are dovish, but yet NOT as dovish as market has priced in, Equities also reverse, like we've seen-Bottom line-We're in a Steep downtrend, so TOUGH to expect FOMC provides the magic answer for stocks after a rally into 2pm
1378 2018-12-19 19:16:10 Bump stocks are a gimmick. They dont change the firearm at all... learn about things before offering a useless opinion.
1379 2018-12-19 19:16:06 Totally agree. I personally think bump stocks or bump fire are technically useless for accuracy. Bottom line, 2A period!
1380 2018-12-19 19:16:05 Congrats Chris Stocks!
1381 2018-12-19 19:15:50 Sir pls guide how to make a trading plan for next day (equity) because i dont have clear understanding of selection of stocks and levels to trade
1382 2018-12-19 19:15:47 I am sure when Fed Powell gives his press conference, he is going to sound Dovish on further possible hikes. Leave the option on the table, but defintely dovish. If not, stocks may go down even further.

NOW, they are cold calling to pump them
WOW
1386 2018-12-19 19:15:12 Bump stocks are not anything essential to preserve 2A rights. Weak argument.
1387 2018-12-19 19:15:02 Trump made bump stocks illegal.. .
1388 2018-12-19 19:14:58 Feds raising rates and stocks correcting as CT saltiness drops to multi month low. #bitcoin #alts
1389 2018-12-19 19:14:47 He got us out of a depression. We were never at war with NK, the issue was their Nuclear program which they have expanded since Trump got into office. They can now hit continental US. This is the worst December for stocks since the great depression. Keep drinking that Kool Aid
1390 2018-12-19 19:14:46 #US stocks erased most of their gains, the $USD rebounded from its lows of the day and benchmark #Treasury yields held steady as the Federal Reserve signaled additional rate hikes remain warranted, striking a slightly less dovish tone than some #investors had anticipated!

1392 2018-12-19 19:14:38 I dunno - I’d look at bond yields not stocks right now as there was a lot of front running.  They lowered to 2 projected then left themselves a data dependent out to go up down.  10’yr down to 2.78 so they are buying what the Fed is cooking lol
1393 2018-12-19 19:14:37 and stocks tank..what nonsense
1394 2018-12-19 19:14:30 I hear the sound of all those algos dumping stocks
1395 2018-12-19 19:14:12 Federal law is very strict on auto parts. I know you can trade out parts like the stocks. I also know ejection panels(?) can be replaced. But past that idk what fed law allows for part swaps. 

“Snap the bolt off”?
1396 2018-12-19 19:14:07 You do realize that these stocks do not modify the function of the firearm at all... it is a gimmick that can be done with a rubber band or your finger and belt loop... no accuracy at all, just a lot of noise.
1397 2018-12-19 19:14:03 I'm tired of hearing about why Sandberg and Zuckerberg are lacking morals. I want to hear about the FB etc employees who walked away from their jobs, compensation, stocks - even before the stocks dropped - bc they realized they disagreed with the leadership.
1398 2018-12-19 19:14:01 Bonds popped & stocks dropped.Tells you all you need to know about investors confidence in the current FOMC. Frightening how clueless this FOMC is.Reminds me of Bernanke in late 2007.He was well behind the curve & spent most of '08 trying to catch up & never did.Fed's always late

1419 2018-12-19 19:11:15 Bump stocks are not weapons, if I understand correctly. I don't believe accessories are afforded the same protections as arms. You can bear a weapon with or without one.
1420 2018-12-19 19:11:13 i.e. if stocks crash then we'll change our minds

1423 2018-12-19 19:10:53 Article is thoughtfully written, although I disagree. Mainly I dislike his idea of a house as a financial endowment for your life. Houses are great to live in. As investments, they suck — can be as volatile as stocks, but lower-return. And a stock doesn't get a leaky roof.
1424 2018-12-19 19:10:48 @realDonaldTrump protect the 2nd amendment. Nobody likes the bump stocks but don’t mess with our 2nd amendment #2A #nationalconcealedcarry pass it even if you have to pass an executive order. #EndTheFed

1435 2018-12-19 19:09:44 @NRA your boi individual 1 just took away "bump stocks".... Where's your outrage? What about the second amendment?
1436 2018-12-19 19:09:30 Dec. rate hike was widely expected by investors - both in conversation and #Fed funds futures market (~75%). What #stocks are keying off of now is the plan for 2 hikes in 2019 (investors wanted fewer). Powell's language and tone during the press conference will be interesting.
1437 2018-12-19 19:09:26 You know what would be even better than banning bump stocks?  Banning you and your tweeter account.

1441 2018-12-19 19:08:04 Fed hikes, reduces growth outlook and 2019 rate hikes to 2 from 3 earlier.
Dovish policy but not dovish enough. Bonds Yield curve flattens further and stocks seeing some correction.
1442 2018-12-19 19:07:59 Stocks lose gains.
1443 2018-12-19 19:07:52 The US military has tanks and AT4 rocket launchers. We, as citizens, should be able to match the govt un for gun. I need way more than bump stocks. All weapon restrictions of the American people need lifted.
1444 2018-12-19 19:07:52 OMFG stocks panic
1445 2018-12-19 19:07:48 Yes. That's ok. Most people with guns don't have bump stocks either. They're strictly for nerds and people who were severely bullied in school. They could do the same thing with their thumb through a belt loop or with a rubber band, but they don't have friends so no one told them
1446 2018-12-19 19:07:36 You all would know more about that stuff behind the scenes than I would...I'm just looking at price action.  There are many financial examples of the past of something rallying though it may not be worth much like tech stocks in late 90's

1450 2018-12-19 19:06:54 The bone you threw the gun grabbers with the bump stock issue is a mission creep.  And to do so propagates a fake FBI narrative of what really happened in Vegas ...horrible.  Bump stocks are a joke. Any rifle can be bump fired with a belt loop.
1451 2018-12-19 19:06:49 Stocks turn negative after Fed hikes rates, Dow was up more than 350 points -- CNBC
1452 2018-12-19 19:06:27 The Fed raised interest rates, as expected, for the 4th time this year. It's forecasting slightly slower increases in interest rates in 2019.
Stocks are wavering and have given up most of the big gain they made right before the decision was announced.
1453 2018-12-19 19:06:24 bond market is now for sure pricing in recession as it should...the lack of ability to get away from fucking text books and looking at the real world...stocks should be down 1000...it is not doveish when you look at the dot plots assholes...that is what you look at

1457 2018-12-19 19:06:10 It's not the people's place to decide if her ads should be run. In fact, it wasn't even up to Bell either since Tory has stocks in the company. There's a clear conflict of interest here which makes me think its rigged. Goldy was a threat and they had to remove that threat! Sick!

1474 2018-12-19 19:04:19 No matter what your opinion regarding bump stocks you should be AGAINST the ATF simply re-writing federal regulations to "outlaw" something perfectly legal.

1476 2018-12-19 19:04:13 What a wild and bizarre reaction to the #FOMC December statement. DOW went from ~250 to ~350 then ~150 inside of 10 seconds. Now around 80. #machines #stocks

1500 2018-12-19 18:59:31 Bump stocks ban and now pulling troops out of Syria. Both were not on the Republican agenda. It is either a house/Congress result or Trump helped nudged them along because the guillotine is about to come down on him.
1501 2018-12-19 18:59:25 I looked up bump stocks after shooting in Vegas.  It is a veteran run business that invented to help disabled vets be able to shoot again.  This is part of gun control.
1502 2018-12-19 18:59:17 I moved all my gazillions to treasuries over the past 6 months. Little left in  stocks. At my age not enough time 2 ride it out.
1503 2018-12-19 18:59:03 Instead of stocks, I was thinking bout investing in Hermès bags. The ROI is crazy and pretty much guaranteed
1504 2018-12-19 18:59:02 I expect the Fed to raise rates to 2 ¼-2 ½, acknowledge market vol and softening data, keep data dependent stance on future tightening, & guide toward 1-2 rate hikes in 2019. Relief rally in stocks before resuming selloff, and short treasuries will back up a bit. #fomc #arxmgmt

My Opinion Is We're In For A 20% Correction.
1506 2018-12-19 18:58:47 a few ideas to avoid stocks:
-see if your bank/credit union offers better interest rates at certain levels of savings or types of accounts
-see if you have any interest in municipal/state bonds that are paid out 20-30 years from now
1507 2018-12-19 18:58:38 I'm 80 % invested in stocks & calls cause they triggered my BPs & made big progress. I only follow my Rules: Setups = Trades! $SPY $QQQ $IWM
1508 2018-12-19 18:58:30 That's not the point. I agree, bump stocks are just a novelty, but it's not about them being necessary or useful, it's about preventing infringement of our rights and keeping a bad precedent from being set.
1509 2018-12-19 18:58:29 The Constitution is words on a paper, just like the words re-fashioning the legality of bump-stocks. Words cannot make people behave honorably nor compel them to relinquish items or ideals.

Laws are largley irrelevant; what matters is what behaviors society rewards & punishes.
1510 2018-12-19 18:58:28 Stocks rising ahead of the Fed interest rate decision. Dow +280 points.
1511 2018-12-19 18:57:51 That is probably is true. Articulating stocks became popular in '94 with the passage of the Brady Bill which restricted automatic rifle purchases. They've been around for a while, though not a very popular augmentation.
1512 2018-12-19 18:57:49 They are, it's just not refined units from US/EU/SE Asia LME stocks. Something doesn't add up when your apparent consumption is up 12% and real demand is up 4% MAX YTD. I suspect copper was once again being used in the financing arena given the pullback in shadow finance in 2018.
1513 2018-12-19 18:57:48 You can actually use crypto to offset gains from stocks, real estate, and other capital assets too

1515 2018-12-19 18:57:25 I thought for a long time like many traders that half-kelly was a simple way to do that (be pessimistic) - however I did a full review of my errors regarding penny stocks, and a monte carlo simulation of the level of pessimism required - it is much more critical than I thought

1519 2018-12-19 18:56:44 can divdens be payed the same way as stocks
1520 2018-12-19 18:56:44 Also...since I don’t pay attention...just heard financial stocks have been clobbered in recent weeks. That’s telling.
1521 2018-12-19 18:56:32 You are being dramatic. Bump stocks turn semi-autos into effective autos. Autos are already basically illegal, outside of a few expensive permits. This is a reasonable measure.
1522 2018-12-19 18:56:28 My favorite thing about the iOS 12 Stocks app is the delay between displaying reallllly old data and the new data, those little momentary heart attacks just brighten my day.
1523 2018-12-19 18:56:25 stocks go down from plus 250 to down 300 after the fed announces rate hike and more importantly there dot plots stay at three hikes for 2019 and 2 for 2020...complete lunicy
1524 2018-12-19 18:56:16 And they all need to be evaluated for mental health by taking a taking a comprehensive psych eval and complete 100% divestiture of any stocks or or affiliations with any corporations or entities that the government does business with.
1525 2018-12-19 18:56:15 I either get the VIX cheap, or stocks cheap... What will it be?
1526 2018-12-19 18:56:00 Think maybe it's the profit takers? Big investors use augoryms to buy and sell with major daily movements. Industry news also affect stocks.
1527 2018-12-19 18:55:59 I am with you but let’s wait and see. There is a great deal more at stake than bump stocks. We should be able to purchase modern machine guns at reasonable prices. Maybe after 2020?
1528 2018-12-19 18:55:54 Let's be honest you not going to get anyone to trun in there Bump stocks you will be a damn fool if you do
1529 2018-12-19 18:55:46 Correction: 52% of Americans buy stocks, mostly through 401K plans and the VAST majority of returns go to the top 10%. In this system profits are privatized and debt is socialized. This debt is then passed on to future generations in a modern version of the Philosopher's Stone.
1530 2018-12-19 18:55:26 You are correct, little would make me support trump.Does not mean I am against everything he supports. Tax reform was necessary (but they went too far).Fine with banning gun stocks (need to go a bit further), fine with prison reform (although admittedly, do not know details yet).

1535 2018-12-19 18:54:23 I'm sure he has heard it a lot, but wants to make you think you're the weird one. I believe stocks typically have higher commissions for the managers.
1536 2018-12-19 18:53:47 $VIX needs to crack & sustain below $23 to signal a sustained press-up in stocks IMHO. Anything above the 2 day highs on a sustained basis, could be problematic for Stocks.
1537 2018-12-19 18:53:43 I disagree with President Trump's viewpoint on outlawing bump-stocks.
1538 2018-12-19 18:53:41 Honestly, it doesn't sound like he has fiduciary responsibility and he either got into this to gamble with other people's money or he gets a better fee structure somehow. Individual stocks are almost always a terrible idea anyway.

1540 2018-12-19 18:53:31 nobody is going to turn in their bump stocks just because some bureaucrats said so.
1541 2018-12-19 18:52:57 Post statement, the key to watch is dividend stocks relative to financials.
1542 2018-12-19 18:52:07 One thing to note is TONS of badly wounded stocks. This has forced hedge funds to sell decent/good charts also like $csco $intc $v $axp $ma $crm $splk $msft resulting in almost zero leadership.

1549 2018-12-19 18:49:43 Ask to see the lines for all the stocks that went out of business
1550 2018-12-19 18:49:36 Then I am dead wrong. But, of course, why ask the question now?  It is as valid six months earlier or six months from now.  Why do you ask and notice after stocks decline and place more credence then? Or, maybe you don’t.

1552 2018-12-19 18:48:56 With $IWM up big ( and the Indices ) you would think my stocks would catch a bid... Checks $XBI, sees its flat... Nevermind
1553 2018-12-19 18:48:42 Sounds like an incompetent trying to sell you something. Index funds are a good investment for funds that are not essential. If this is the first money you can put away, this stocks seem like questionable advice.
1554 2018-12-19 18:48:27 I know a few people in the industry into stocks even a little and they're never happy about it, the companies need to meet the most bizarre standards of success or the stock drops, or the CEO does something bad, or whatever, it's too nerve wracking
1555 2018-12-19 18:47:49 It is absolutely true. Obama never passed any gun control legislation because he was constantly blocked. Trump just banned Bump Stocks on executive order. He has taken away more gun rights than Obama.
1556 2018-12-19 18:47:48 Thank you for supporting the ban on bump stocks. Please veto HB228 - We need local control - Ohio cities enacting local gun violence solutions shouldn't be vulnerable to lawsuits from gun lobbies.
1557 2018-12-19 18:47:23 Message of the Market?

1558 2018-12-19 18:47:23 What would we do without our federal government keeping us safe from bump stocks. Sticking their nose in our 2A rights while not securing our border. Good job Senator!!
1559 2018-12-19 18:47:11 Better hide your bump stocks for the those emergencies
1560 2018-12-19 18:47:08 jobs are a tremendous indicator for stocks.   You have to look at Weekly Claims every single Thursday
1561 2018-12-19 18:47:00 @POTUS What is your proposal for your ATF Gestapo Agency to force your servants to rid themselves of bump stocks that they already legally bought & owned?  Door to door pillage and seizure, followed by fines and imprisonment?  No grandfather clause?
1562 2018-12-19 18:46:58 Anybody else notice the right wingers didn't flip out over @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks? Not even @NRA Weird. It's like they don't actually stand for anything.
1563 2018-12-19 18:45:58 So, what sort of a 'gesture' was it when the Obama administration approved bump stocks for sale?
1564 2018-12-19 18:45:42 My pot stocks have done pretty well.
1565 2018-12-19 18:44:29 Qué idiota! Bump stocks are a FIREARM ACCESSORY that allows guns to fire AS quickly AS automatic machine guns. Also, most lawmakers & the DOJ lack the technical & policy-relevant knowledge needed to understand the implications of legislative proposals (e.g."assault weapons").
1566 2018-12-19 18:44:06 The NRA is weak, but they will try and twist Trump's arm.  But be aware of this -- it's work by people such as you, Fred, that got Trump's action about bump stocks.  He's seeing the political winds change re guns.  Small action, but might indicate a national move.  Keep fighting.

1582 2018-12-19 18:40:19 Then why hasn’t these been used before? Bump stocks have been around since 1996. Why haven’t they been used in EVERY shooting? Why did the kid in the TX school shooting use a shotgun?

1584 2018-12-19 18:40:17 My understanding is that the NRA is in favor of banning bump stocks.
1585 2018-12-19 18:39:25 Machine guns have been illegal for a long time and bump stocks alter semi-autos into near machine guns. So, logical to outlaw both or neither.
1586 2018-12-19 18:38:26 He manipulated stocks (one from pavseh's pack) and used some CCs
1587 2018-12-19 18:38:04 The Trump presidency will be remembered for a ban on bump stocks, no wall, increased government overreach, corruption scandals, and threats against the first amendment. So basically he’s a democrat.
1588 2018-12-19 18:37:54 @KaitMarieox Trump has created a new small Business sector with his bump stock ban. Since boys can identify as girls and girls can identify as boys and since guns are considered like individuals. I see bump stocks all over America self identifying as table lamps , book ends, ect.

1593 2018-12-19 18:36:10 And housing down 7% yoy and FedEx you got plenty of reasons, they won't mention bank stocks though.
1594 2018-12-19 18:36:08 Or, that as stocks decline people look for reasons to justify it. Both can be true, I guess.
1595 2018-12-19 18:36:01 How about silencers, optics and pistol grip long guns? Are bump stocks it or just the start?
1596 2018-12-19 18:35:18 Im really actually happy about it. It tastes bad and 2 how did you know how stocks work.

1620 2018-12-19 18:29:09 How did he?
I heard he was banning bump stocks or whatever.
But I don't see how banning those is selling out gun onwers.
1621 2018-12-19 18:28:53 It starts with small steps. Having to be 21 to have a gun in California, a ban on bump stocks. One day they're going to try to completely take away our right to have guns. Why? Why do they want us unable to protect ourselves 
1622 2018-12-19 18:28:45 They've always had this ability to classify bump stocks as NFA items.  But they were concerned about lawsuits.

The confiscation aspect of this solution is, however, unpalatable. Grandfathering existing owners would be fairer, but likely not possible within existing regs.
1623 2018-12-19 18:28:42 Software stocks just rock solid so far,all up big.
1624 2018-12-19 18:28:23 I don't think you know what you're talking about. Bump stocks allow the entire gun (including trigger) to move rearward during recoil. Then when the gun springs back forward, the trigger rebounds against the finger which fired the first shot - initiating subsequent shots.
1625 2018-12-19 18:28:19 well banning bump stocks solved that problem, now let's build the damn wall and make America safe for Americans, which should include the little tykes in the schools.

1633 2018-12-19 18:25:27 are you allowed to own a hand grenade to protect you from a home invader? the point is that every law must be held within reason when taking account the greater good of society. bump stocks have no use or place and do not help you protect yourself. get real and don't be obtuse.

1651 2018-12-19 18:22:38 no one's gonna turn those in, this is an exercise in stupidity, and hopefully be overturned in court anyway

That said, bump stocks are kinda dumb.  I think Trump's deflection of the Las Vegas ire onto them was pretty smart, as it turned a potentially big fight into a tiny one.

1657 2018-12-19 18:20:10 i totally agree, the xenophovbes donet realize their policies will make the problems much worse. and can make the country vulnerable in high ticket areas like real esate and stocks.  a sensible and inclusive doormat actually will be far more insulating from a shock

1659 2018-12-19 18:20:03 If it feels like stocks are having trouble keeping their gains each day, it is true.

In December the S&P 500 has closed an avg of 1.32% off intraday high.

Worst month since Sept '11 (-1.37%).

Worst Dec since '08 and '00 before that.

Glass half full view is month isn't over.
1660 2018-12-19 18:19:55 It’s a diversion. Everytime trump gets in trouble he comes out with something. Bump stocks which were supposed to happen months and months ago, now are on the table.Syria same same. I think he piles up crap on his desk then we he needs a diversion hethrows it out there,contrived
1661 2018-12-19 18:19:20 First they came for the bump stocks and i said nothing because i was not a bump stock...

1665 2018-12-19 18:17:47 Paying for it with my stocks money 
1666 2018-12-19 18:17:20 Honestly, I have no real issue banning bump stocks, but the criminalization of possession after the fact is rather authoritarian and statist.
1667 2018-12-19 18:17:16 Well at the rate the stocks are dropping and at a rapid rate since the purge of all nsfw content it would not surprise me if it's able to be worth even a million dollars by the end of the week let a long the month.
1668 2018-12-19 18:16:45 Falling Treasury yields in the US are seen as negative for the US stocks.

Falling G-Sec bond yields in India are seen as positive for Indian stocks.

As usual, I'm confused!

I can't "hit a Bull in the Ass with a Bass Fiddle" with the normal stocks. 
Last thing I need is a Gimmick to make a weapon jump around more than my normal shaking
It's A Dumb Assed Ban
Bump Stock used in no Mass Shootings
Maybe in Vegas, Just Maybe?
1671 2018-12-19 18:14:35 It's still really thin -  but it is showing the early signs of accumulation.  I think it's going to take one more earnings gap up to get it to the tipping point to make a big move.  -- Still too early-  take a look at when stocks like $SQ made their big moves

1673 2018-12-19 18:13:54 You have 90 days to turn in your bump stocks to the ATF. They are now classified as “machine guns” and if you get caught with one you will be charged with a felony. No exceptions.
1674 2018-12-19 18:13:17 I hear ya. I totally understand and agree.

I just don't feel like bump stocks are the hill to die on.

Trump knows that we have NO rights if we can't defend them. Voter ID is in the pipe. We'll eventually rid the nation of those that want to disarm us.    

(Looking at you, CA)
1675 2018-12-19 18:12:58 Agree.    if the government truly cared about life and death as much as they claim to,  they would ban things like abortion and cigarettes.  Abortion and cigarettes kill more people every year than bump stocks yet they  aren’t banned.
1676 2018-12-19 18:12:35 Bonsoir @TopAchat et @LDLC ! Est il prévu que vous receviez dans vos stocks le Boitier Cooler Master Cosmos C700M svp ? Et j'aimerais faire une config a plus de 3k € serait il possible d'en discuté en MP svp ?
1677 2018-12-19 18:12:11 @realDonaldTrump we also know that power grabs like this will only give the next Democrat President & Democrat Congress the idea of going farther. Nobody cares about bump-stocks what we care about are unconstitutional government power grabs.
1678 2018-12-19 18:12:09 Do gold stocks know something. Steady steady steady selling.
1679 2018-12-19 18:12:05 BS. Bump stocks never met the legal requirements. Obama let them become legal for future propaganda demonizing guns. It worked very well. You fell for it.
1680 2018-12-19 18:12:01 Today I fully realized that I’m done with rims on cars and all that fancy shit. It don’t matter. I’ve outgrown it. A nice car with stocks fine with me.
1681 2018-12-19 18:11:57 ...which term includes both his stocks of unfinished goods or working capital and his stocks of finished goods.” In our words, that’s “inventory.” But in our accounting tallies, inventory is a very small part of firms’ real “capital stock.” And it's *not* "capital equipment." ??

1685 2018-12-19 18:10:26 Wasn’t bump stock ban and criminal justice reform a bipartisan win..bump stocks have been banned at NRA shooting ranges for quite some time.

1687 2018-12-19 18:09:48 Pretty much they said that bump stocks were the only thing. “Rate increasing devices” were never mentioned
1688 2018-12-19 18:09:46 Defense stocks have IMO been sniffing this out perhaps?
1689 2018-12-19 18:09:44 to help you out, she’s sold $630M in products (very cheaply made products haha), she does have more money than Kim, it’s no secret. & her company actually doesn’t have stocks/shares. She owns ALL of it.
1690 2018-12-19 18:09:29 Trump banning bump stocks is really gonna fuck with the folks who think he can do no wrong but also all gun regulation is tyranny
1691 2018-12-19 18:09:24 If y'all have stocks I'd probably pull out soon
1692 2018-12-19 18:09:15 Yeah I’m watching that myself crazy selling for company that has no debt
1693 2018-12-19 18:09:01 The farm bill should authorize the stocks and the sale of rotten vegetables
1694 2018-12-19 18:08:58 The admin finally did something I can get behind and banned bump stocks
1695 2018-12-19 18:08:49 Another one who had time to ban bump stocks with a @GOP controlled House, Senate and White House, but failed to get any National Concealed Carry Reciprocity done. I'm glad he's leaving and I hope the rest of you all get "Primaried" in the next election. Bunch of lying RINO's.
1696 2018-12-19 18:08:38 I check my stocks like ones really gonna shoot to a million a share lol
1697 2018-12-19 18:08:33 Not sure how I feel about being described as a "preachy Harvard kid" but delighted that our research is spurring good conversation about investing in leveraged micro-cap growth stocks at peak cycle at 2/20 fees :)
1698 2018-12-19 18:08:14 P.M. brother keep doing your thing man, when it comes to trading i've probably never seen another trader try to explain the type of potential that can be made in trading the stocks in the OTC than you, Keep doing what you're doing, it's helpful to others  > 
1699 2018-12-19 18:07:42 Hey you just sell options or also do stocks??
1700 2018-12-19 18:07:42 Bump stocks are very inaccurate, especially at long distance.

I swear he's a Democrat that can't stop watching Fox networks because of his stocks.

It worries me.
1704 2018-12-19 18:06:11 I laugh, 5 years ago quit buying anything made in China and deleted everything in/on FB. I wish I had picked some stocks back then.
1705 2018-12-19 18:06:05 As a FFL dealer, I disagree with u. These stocks create a fuzzy line between semi-auto and full-auto, full being illegal. The problem is, if we give a 1/4" they want a foot.

1707 2018-12-19 18:05:38 Forget the bump stocks ban the democrats from the U.S. and the world would be a better place
1708 2018-12-19 18:05:38 .@JohnKasich praises @realDonaldTrump decision: "They are going to ban bump stocks – thank God. We can’t get it done over here.”

The Fed can either wait for #3 to happen before printing (USD up, then Armageddon), or Fed can ease into it.  IMO they may be starting latter tact
1713 2018-12-19 18:04:40 I just fused random stocks and made some shapes and used cc and color changes
1714 2018-12-19 18:04:33 Put another way .
It is illegal without a license for a suppressor to manufacture your own .200$ stamp so I am told .
It is also illegal unless licensed to buy the parts and make an AR full auto.

Maybe bump stocks should be reclassified under those guidelines  instead of a BAN .
1715 2018-12-19 18:04:24 That shit was on fire when you weren't sding most of your stocks LOL
1716 2018-12-19 18:04:20 It’s not banning bump stocks either

1721 2018-12-19 18:00:51 Bump stocks were determined for years to be legal.  Now, and perhaps rightfully so, that position has changed.  However, why not stop all new sales and let the others grandfather in?  What is the penalty for having one when the time elapses?

You're banning bump stocks, giving money to Mexico and not building the wall. No wall means you failed and this whole thing was a fucking waste.
1728 2018-12-19 17:59:45 Expecting good news? Stocks surge ahead of Fed
1729 2018-12-19 17:59:45 My general view is bump stocks are objectively useless (in that they only increase fire rate by minimal amounts and lead to inaccuracy) *i don’t agree with the ban to be clear* i feel like there are more important fights on the horizon.

1734 2018-12-19 17:59:02 Today, the @nytimes has stories about federal prison reform (at least a start) AND the banning of bump-stocks, both brought to you by @realDonaldTrump and the Republican Congress. We're living in the Upside-Down, folks.
1735 2018-12-19 17:58:54 I'm not saying bump stocks are not silly, I'm saying the overly Orwellian rules written into this bump stock ban, things including 10 years in jail for violating it, even if you don't own a compatible semi-auto rifle to attach it too.
1736 2018-12-19 17:58:40 @nasdaq Called $hiiq yesterday to ask about false FBI rumors and also Sutton from Craig Hallum called Gavin (CEO) about rumors. @NewYorkFBI Spreading false rumors to drive stocks down is a CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

1755 2018-12-19 17:54:22 Bump stocks are explicitly prohibited in Canada
1756 2018-12-19 17:54:19 We haven't defeated anybody in Syria, and the shortsellers are the bulls' best friends. They are the only buyers in this market. All the bulls are out of cash.  Once the shortsellers have covered most of their positions, a demand vacuum will follow, and stocks will crash.
1757 2018-12-19 17:53:27 Bump stocks dont equal machine guns. They are severely functionally different. I mean, if you ever took apart a firearm, you would know this.
1758 2018-12-19 17:52:57 Which right? Right to a bump stock? Fyi, small government does not mean no rules. As for bump stocks, they are silly. I own 2 ARs
1759 2018-12-19 17:52:40 @nra @nraila Why are you silent on the unconstitutional banning of bump stocks? What happened to the "no-compromise" gun rights organization?

1764 2018-12-19 17:51:41 ATF by their definition change made bump stocks prohibited.
if atf is permitted to change at potus request,
nothing will stop demorats once they regain power.
NEXT will be ar's, 
then any semiautomatic will be prohibited.
Maybe flintlocks will be legal for CITIZENS to possess.

1768 2018-12-19 17:51:04 Bump stocks never passed the smell test. They were legalized by Obama to further Demonize semi auto firearms. This was done to create Propaganda talking points. Which has obviously worked.

1777 2018-12-19 17:48:46 Does anyone know what has happened to the project to breed more scent back into #Freesias? Untill the mid 70s each flower had an incredible level of scent, but, so the story goes, some of this was lost when Dutch growers bred up huge stocks with bigger flowers.
1778 2018-12-19 17:48:23 It's a violation of Article1, Section10, of our Constitution, Ex Post Facto. You can't punish conduct that was legal when committed.  ATF ruled Bump Stocks were legal so simply owning one bought prior to this law cannot be a punishable offense.
1779 2018-12-19 17:48:06 So full autos are banned except from special licensed people but bump stocks ok? Where is the logic there

4. Nationalize red flag laws. Currently only 4 states have them. 

These are just some ideas, there are many others that make sense. I am grateful that this administration has addressed bump stocks. We need to keep going.
1787 2018-12-19 17:46:10 This is great news - Trump gets rid of the bump stocks that the Obama administration approved in the first place.
1788 2018-12-19 17:46:04 For Christmas I’m buyin myself some stocks
1789 2018-12-19 17:45:59 Coke - you invest in stocks you receive a dividend and its public knowledge . Ferry - where does my tax dollar go and do I receive a return ? No !   Pretty lame analogy if you ask me .

1791 2018-12-19 17:45:38 Nothing has changed- FED still will be decreasing balance sheet so they have some ammo for the next downturn- why they buying up stocks —smh- not a bull or bear just stating some obvious facts
1792 2018-12-19 17:45:28 It wouldn’t matter for me it won’t make my stocks go up
1793 2018-12-19 17:44:44 Where are you coming from.  Do you even understand how bump stocks work.  Are you daying that Automatic Weapons and Bump Stocks are necessary because of ??  Please answer the ??
1794 2018-12-19 17:44:36 I'm the one who was attempting to smear some camo paint on each other's faces until you decided to chat about stocks.

1797 2018-12-19 17:44:14 Yeah I’d say less noise but StockTwits Community is less crypto focused and more stocks. That’s how my account on there is too, definitely post more about stocks and a little on crypto. If you just want my crypto this is the place and crypto community on twitter still better imo
1798 2018-12-19 17:44:12 It’s only in pubs on the tap and only while stocks last - a few pubs round here have it. I’ll try and find out and let you know
1799 2018-12-19 17:43:54 Whether $tge is true, partly true or in discussions, it is a fact that midstream stocks are crazy cheap now, mostly simplified, coverage ratios on disty can withstand most anything & new projects ramping and needed.  $et $epd $mplx $cnxm $hesm $omp $trgp $paa
1800 2018-12-19 17:43:49 We won’t suddenly be able to catch more fish. We’ll still have to manage stocks - by coordination with other European countries - to avoid overfishing.

1803 2018-12-19 17:42:53 bump stocks are an abomination…
no shooter worth his salt uses a f-ing bump stock…

1805 2018-12-19 17:42:36 Last week of 2018-first week 2019

1806 2018-12-19 17:42:28 Yes, they get rewarded with their salaries. We shouldn't be increasing the deficit so billionaires can get millions of dollars in tax refunds.  Refunds they were supposed to give back to their companies and middle employees, and instead bought their own stocks.

1812 2018-12-19 17:41:31 Our President has numerous charges against him. He lies, he cheats & is self serving. Our economy is failing. Stocks are headed for correction, deficit more than doubled & experts say we are headed for recession.
1813 2018-12-19 17:41:30 2019: learn stocks and market share
1814 2018-12-19 17:41:23 Since Trump just did a ban on bump stocks with no grandfathering in and no compensation I am questioning his judgment on things. Trump gave the gun activist and inch and they will take mile now, and Trump set a precedent.
1815 2018-12-19 17:41:22 If Senator @JimInhofe wasn't so busy buying defense related stocks, he might have more time to maintain oversight of our *actual* defenses. Just a thought.
1816 2018-12-19 17:41:17 Gold stocks are making a strong move higher & indicating a further rally over the coming weeks. The market volatility & return of fear makes gold shine. 

Under-owned + under-valued miners can easily see sharp capital investment inflows. Allocating more cash into market today.
1817 2018-12-19 17:41:12 Say bye to bump stocks

1820 2018-12-19 17:40:44 Stocks in QEC is now at CAD 0,225. You should buy a few, like an insider 
1821 2018-12-19 17:40:34 Something good for us from the White House. And bump stocks as well. Are you okay?
1822 2018-12-19 17:40:33 Fun challenging interview today on @CNBC @SquawkAlley with @MorganLBrennan & @jonfortt. They jumped to specific stocks and the current news, yet as a very Long-Term investor we look well beyond today. The key is good Governance at the Corp Board of Directors @NACD
1823 2018-12-19 17:40:23 if you are investing your money, put it in stocks and funds that are committed to those same goals. Swell has some good funds for that. Not code related per se, but money speaks loudest.
1824 2018-12-19 17:40:17 maybe not trade small cap or penny stocks? branch out and try large caps or stocks that have liquidity.
1825 2018-12-19 17:39:58 I wanna learn how to trade stocks
1826 2018-12-19 17:39:58 Banning bump stocks is a wonderful thing, no need for them. Thank you for this bill.
1827 2018-12-19 17:39:55 Someone asked what stocks should you be holding during a rate hike.  $BA use to do well when we entered the rising interest rate environment rising about $3 the day of hikes if memory serves me, bt I think last hike it dropped. One stock I wouldn't want to hold is $GOOS or retail

1830 2018-12-19 17:39:33 Who uses bump stocks?
1831 2018-12-19 17:39:15 All smartphones and Apple watches will  now be reduced in price by £5 per day until Christmas, while stocks last.
1832 2018-12-19 17:39:07 Stocks and GBP both by products of Risk on noh :)
1833 2018-12-19 17:38:26 Banning bump stocks is great, but why are any products that alter how a gun fires legal?
1834 2018-12-19 17:38:21 Corporate Greenwash! Stop serving meat since animal ag & meat production = 51% of annual Greenhouse gases + habitat destruction, species extinction, aquatic dead zones, desertification, depleted water resources, decimation of fishing stocks, famine. #McDonaldsGreenwash
1835 2018-12-19 17:38:12 Ted, too many young men, particularly black men are breaking the law. Why? Well, that would be something our elected representatives should be focusing on, finding solutions for. Instead, we're banning bump stocks, giving taxpayer money to wasteful pork projects, etc.
1836 2018-12-19 17:37:49 Correct interpretation of data critical for moving towards evidence-based migration policies and debate. Let's start with difference between stocks and flows. We all have a responsibility to educate.
1837 2018-12-19 17:37:43 re-running my models before the Fed:
sell stocks
sell shiny metals
sell yen
buy oil
buy sterling
in that order of preference
1838 2018-12-19 17:37:39 DOJ banning Bump Stocks? WTF?
1839 2018-12-19 17:37:25 And how exactly does market volume help? 2/3 of any market profits went to 5 corps.  Market volume means nothing when executives are using QE money to buy back their own stocks. And look At over all losses since Trump took office.  Volume means nothing without context
1840 2018-12-19 17:37:25 I will join other conspiracy theorists in forecasting today a #FOMC rate hike w/ softer tones, lowering expectations of future hikes... language to support the increasingly vulnerable rate-sensitive, debt-ridden markets.

1842 2018-12-19 17:36:50 I know of 15 people that own bump stocks not one of them is going to turn them in.Half will sell it back for what they paid for it.The others say to much fun to sell. So just in the small group I associate with none will be given up and I'm betting the big picture will be same

1844 2018-12-19 17:36:09 TS: "If trump is impeached, there's going to be another civil war."

Me: "Gee, I hope you weren't counting on bump stocks, to aid you in your great revolution." 
1845 2018-12-19 17:36:01 Indigo says “stocks” instead of “socks” and we just be going back and forth: me- “SOCKS” her-“STOCKS” and we end up sounding like a damn Dr. Seuss book
1846 2018-12-19 17:35:55 Where in the Constitution does it require auto makers to install seat belts or airlines to perform routine inspections? Are those unconstitutional? Denying bump stocks is not the same as denying a right to own a gun,comrade
1847 2018-12-19 17:35:52 Former Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stan Fisher on @CNBC half-time report just said the Fed is almost solely responsible for the bull market in stocks the last 9 years. Gov fiscal policy has had very little to do with it. Amen to that. Tax cuts just extended it one year. #Markets
1848 2018-12-19 17:35:49 According to Trump machine guns are illegal to own and bump stocks make guns like machine guns. I understand start small then go bigger.
I also know we can  turn semiautomatic into automatic with a tweak so taking bump stocks won't have desired effect.
1849 2018-12-19 17:35:41 How would you make a law to limit the fire rate? The intent is perfectly reasonable, and for the ignorant citizens (me) banana clips and bump stocks are concrete ways to limit the number of bullets per minute
1850 2018-12-19 17:35:25 Trump is beginning to betray gun-owners and the 2nd amendment.  He's starting with bump-stocks.  What'll be next?
1851 2018-12-19 17:35:13 How is banning bump stocks infringing the right to bear arms!?
1852 2018-12-19 17:34:45 So the Fed is no longer a Put in the market yet we are suppose to see earnings growth when the economy is slowing domestically and crashing globally?  Sounds like a reason to buy stocks
1853 2018-12-19 17:34:40 If you wanna play the fed hike - Long the dollar. Cheap oil, rising rates, expensive stocks, and global uncertainty are yelling capital flows into the dollar. Markets have not priced this in
1854 2018-12-19 17:34:20 I just have trouble believing this. No way stocks up this much then gap higher. How would that be a thing
1855 2018-12-19 17:34:17 You can bump fire by putting your thumb in your pocket through the trigger well. Banning the stocks isn't going to stop anything
1856 2018-12-19 17:34:05 @realDonaldTrump so you banned bump stocks. Whats next ? I've supported you from day one, but this kind of bullshits going to lose support you still want to win in 2020 right ?
1857 2018-12-19 17:33:50 Hooray!  It’s something.  Trump admin to impose ban on bump stocks in 3 months!  Sure it will be tied up in court by gun rights groups but there is NO NEED for them.  #NRA #Guns #Trump #GunRightsGroups #LasVegasShooting #BumpStocks
1858 2018-12-19 17:33:45 The US government just banned bump stocks on guns. This is a win for gun-control advocates but likely few democrats will praise this because it was done by the Trump administration.
1859 2018-12-19 17:33:21 About 75% invested; 25% cash. Still just the big boys. Cycling into Cdn energy via $SU, $KEY, $IPL, and $CNQ - also $MX, $MG, and $WFT.

1862 2018-12-19 17:32:47 How about ALL the med schools... they have far bigger influence on ppl but train their docs not to prevent but to "fix" -- usually with pharmaceuticals, since big pharma owns or has huge stocks in, every single med school.
1863 2018-12-19 17:32:33 Their website explains..  .."clarifying that bump stocks fall within the definition of “machinegun” under federal law, as such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger."
1864 2018-12-19 17:32:18 Someone is feeling vulnerable...
-Banning bump stocks
-Compromising on wall
-Removing troops from Syria
Is this guy going to start supporting Medicare For All next?  One can only hope!  That would be some nationalism I could get behind!
1865 2018-12-19 17:32:11 Grind stocks are far more dangerous. We need to ban bump AND grind.
1866 2018-12-19 17:32:05 Small positive up day for stocks.  Could suggest markets expecting a little xmas gift from the FED.
1867 2018-12-19 17:31:40 Well guess I’m going to buy some bump stocks
1868 2018-12-19 17:31:40 Go stocks go
1869 2018-12-19 17:31:26 It was all going great until he banned bump stocks. 2020 will be a very interesting election
1870 2018-12-19 17:31:11 Bump stocks are no real loss. The cause damage to rifle in use, very inaccurate and not good for much more than burning ammo. Its give and take.
1871 2018-12-19 17:31:04 Thanks! I wasn't aware of that aspect of the gun debate and didn't know about bump stocks. 
1872 2018-12-19 17:30:55 Its Christmas time peoples mind is diverted for the festive season & on the background they are getting ready for a no deal brexit. If UK goes into a recession & stocks collapse the narrative is just right to blame everything on the people who voted to leave.! Its their fault!
1873 2018-12-19 17:30:51 Based on 200 moving averages , 85.5% NYSE stocks trading below their 200 day moving average vs 14.50% above their 200 day moving average. It is either interpreted as sell off exhaustion (Bounce/bullish pb) or upcoming major sell off. Time will tell. #stock, #stockmarket
1874 2018-12-19 17:30:31 Honestly, with the ever increasing amount of transfers on a year to year basis, it's hard to really get super excited for #NationalSigningDay. Let's evaluate in 3-4 years, based on who stayed at the school they committed to and how it impacted wins/losses and draft stocks
1875 2018-12-19 17:30:25 You ask an apt question that is preoccupying many a business owner. If your business is into products , ensure that you never sell ALL your product. You must always have a buffer to keep as 'new' stocks when redollarisation happens. Otherwise u need to recapitalise in USD.
1876 2018-12-19 17:30:12 Stupid article who cares about bump stocks, not even NRA isn't making a fuss about it. Any conservative crying about is acting like a liberal crybaby
1877 2018-12-19 17:30:11 In The Market: A 3% rebound in #oil helps E&P, royalty trust, refining shares. But as news on interest rates arrives, #homebuilder and wood products #stocks up past 5 days. Look for bottoming action in $DHI $LEN $NVR. All 3 try to climb past the 50-day MA $OSB $UFPI #trading
1878 2018-12-19 17:29:52 Well as the NRA likes to say when bump stocks are outlawed then only criminals will have bump stocks.....
1879 2018-12-19 17:29:50 Jenny you are the right track. Look at the price action. When stocks are up, TLT is up. When stocks are down TLT is up. Bonds are going up. The market is saying the FED has tightened too much. Look at the open interest in JAN. If you really want to sell a call, sell a call on TBT
1880 2018-12-19 17:29:48 People buying into stocks hoping for dovish Fed speech are still going face pain in 60+ days when trade talks with China dissolve/rate hike in March. By a bit of crypto but don’t just #fomo into a shitcoin $btc #Crypto

1887 2018-12-19 17:28:15 And don’t forget those for-profit prisons, their stocks being traded on the NYSE. Sick.
1888 2018-12-19 17:28:07 Disappointed with The President’s ban on bump stocks. Unfortunately these laws will never stop someone who is trying to harm and kill people. Those people are sick and will find a way to attack citizens. You could ban guns and it wouldn’t help. It starts with mental health.
1889 2018-12-19 17:28:06 In simple words, it calculates number of stocks in a bullish swing.

1898 2018-12-19 17:25:38 battles already happen super fast in this game
2 stocks is wayy to short, and makes comebacks annoying too
1899 2018-12-19 17:25:26 But they have no problem front running stocks they pump bc that's their advantage.  They have no advantage with the Fed.... obviously.   Although Jimmy probably thinks he does.
1900 2018-12-19 17:25:15 Hmm... I read one of your tweets and it sounds like you’re not doing so well with your stocks. I’ve been investing for years, and mine are doing well.
1901 2018-12-19 17:25:12 Doesn't go far enough-while handguns & hunting rifles are fine for personal protection & sport, semi automatics serve no purpose except to kill as many as possible-bump stocks are the least worry as they are not used in mass shooting as much as the AR 15 & similar weapons.
1902 2018-12-19 17:24:59 My 2 cents. There are numerous signs the economy is slowing. It's even reflected in the market price action. Example, $FDX warning. What will Fed do and say today? I don't know. We'll let market action dictate our actions. #stocks

1913 2018-12-19 17:21:44 Bump stocks are not that big of a deal to most 2A people. Only the hard core will care and he already knows he can get away with almost anything. This is an attempt to play both sides. Don’t be fooled.
1914 2018-12-19 17:21:44 @CNBC The yield curve has flattened because of the flight to safety out of stocks. Nobody's talking about this.
1915 2018-12-19 17:21:41 Bump stocks weren't used in any school shooting. Banning them won't do anything to stop them.

1917 2018-12-19 17:21:17 In one sweep of the pen with your attack against legal firearm owners you have pissed off 20% of your base.. Bump stocks? Who cares, but trespass on a freedom that’s not really any of your damned business.
I know this was an appeasement move but what’s next?
1918 2018-12-19 17:21:03 Too many traders that only want easy answers. Some would prefer a prediction versus doing real research. Trading stocks takes work.
1919 2018-12-19 17:20:25 US #Stocks extending gains to session highs

1920 2018-12-19 17:20:08 Buy bonds, buy stocks, buy oil, buy gold. Sell vol, dollars.
1921 2018-12-19 17:20:07 So bump stocks are banned now... Its a good thing I lost all mine in a boat acident last week
1922 2018-12-19 17:19:57 Interesting idea, but you can buy very well capitalized property REIT preferred stocks with 7.5% yields today - why mess around with the preferreds of these highly leveraged natural gas partnerships?
1923 2018-12-19 17:19:56 God its fun to watch Trumpers fight amongst themselves over whether they are okay with the orange one taking away their bump stocks.
1924 2018-12-19 17:19:46 This is something that entices them to not fund the wall! But, DJT has done so much for this country that I do not think this would sway voters. Going off what he has done is enough for me to vote for him again. I don't like the ban on bump stocks, but we will see how things go.
1925 2018-12-19 17:19:30 Are bump stocks mentioned in the Constitution? No! 
An executive order would suffice.
1926 2018-12-19 17:19:19 It is not tax reform!  It is PR to gas light poor into believing the in trickle down!  Convince people of stocks up they are doing great.  Repubs have been playing the deficit game for decades to shift $ to wealthy!  @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @maddow @nytpolitics
1927 2018-12-19 17:19:04 Ya if they were created before 1986.. you are correct but any automatic rifle created after is illegal. And bump stocks are also now illegal bc they make a legal weapon illegal for under $400.
1928 2018-12-19 17:18:20 It was a fight worth fighting. That's the difference. Bump stocks are not.
1929 2018-12-19 17:18:08 Oh I see.  Looks like private businesses.  Stock market is for investing and trading public stocks.  If they are public, I don't see their public names.  But it looks like they are private businesses.  They first need to go public in order for you to buy a public stock.
1930 2018-12-19 17:17:48 $tgodf way oversold.. this is one of the best POT stocks out there IMO
1931 2018-12-19 17:17:42 Wrong. 

Trump gets to work at 11: 00 and has days of empty calendars. Obama worked 10 hour days. My stocks tell me Trump is ruining this econony.
1932 2018-12-19 17:17:23 Wait till after trump shuts the gov down lol. Gone lose all your stocks if you do it before
1933 2018-12-19 17:17:19 Stocks look so good right now that in the future I’ll buy before every $FED meeting
#kidding Don’t do that
1934 2018-12-19 17:17:08 Def need a business advisor for the new year, need to be investing in stocks and trade. Correctly
1935 2018-12-19 17:17:05 Banning bump stocks is a meaningful first step to keeping our communities safe. Let’s continue working together to pass commonsense gun safety laws and save lives.
1936 2018-12-19 17:17:03 With today’s price action I hereby do declare that the S&P500 correction which took the index from 2900 to 2500 between october and now is OFFICIALLY over...this view remains valid so long as we do not see the 2499 level...dont short this market...yet  $spx $stocks $trade $fed
1937 2018-12-19 17:16:29 .@Thom_Hartmann Your guest DeLuz ruined his own argument against Bump Stocks by asserting "semi-automatic is 1 trigger pull per bullet." You can insert a wooden dowel/rod that does't "pull" the trigger and a bump stock would STILL result in that trigger being pulled = AUTOMATIC!
1938 2018-12-19 17:15:59 His comment was meaningless we know Elon NEEDS to convert the bonds with shares-needs 360+ since they don't have the cash and are borrowing more(manipulation). You're comment was the trigger.I've never seen a more naive cult than tsla bulls other than penny stocks it's crazy
1939 2018-12-19 17:15:52 i need a sugar momma so i can invest in these stocks
1940 2018-12-19 17:15:51 Stocks rising ahead of the Fed interest rate decision. Dow +280 points.
1941 2018-12-19 17:15:39 Soon after the opening bell, Stocks are trading higher. Dow +170 points, Fed in focus.
1942 2018-12-19 17:15:01 I like him a lot, but if you didn't think @ScottAdamsSays was honest when he said that he's politically left of @SenSanders, check out what he said about bump stocks on Periscope this morning. #2A #ShallNotBeInfringed
1943 2018-12-19 17:14:55 Bump stocks have nothing to do with semi auto fire. It is an artificial device to produce what appears to be full auto fire. It was a losing battle out of the gate.
1944 2018-12-19 17:14:04 has anyone noticed how @verizon stocks are ~8% down since beginning of this december while tumblr only representing a tiny fraction of that corporation? I wonder why that might be... 
1945 2018-12-19 17:13:55 Given the other trade wins, if POTUS can just get to a draw w/ China on trade, he can point to a net overall win on trade. The uncertainty gets removed & stocks head back up.
1946 2018-12-19 17:13:49 Yeah I am planning to cover few different kind of projects. Ranging from maps app, stocks app, news app, camera app etc
1947 2018-12-19 17:12:50 $VIX tumbling as stocks rise on FOMC day, despite implied probability of a hike at 'only' ~77% per CME. Bought a bit into $VXX to sell after the decision, can't imagine (even if market gets whatever it wants from Powell) that there won't be some post-FOMC jolts
1948 2018-12-19 17:12:43 Bump stocks have one purpose:  to kill as many people you can as quickly as possible. To support their manufacture and availability is to support mass murder. Thank you for standing up against this.
1949 2018-12-19 17:12:38 Instead of outlawing bump stocks, I thought you were going to fight for law abiding citizens and our #2A rights not being infringed. There was a bill for reciprocity but it never even went for a vote. Now with Democrats, it never will Conservatives are screwed once again by RINOS
1950 2018-12-19 17:12:27 $UVXY Position closed at break even. A good problem to have, being bullish on stocks we're currently holding. i.e. $GTX (as recently posted)

1953 2018-12-19 17:11:57 Not exactly looking like a market that is anticipating a hike...Dollar down, stocks up, gold up.
1954 2018-12-19 17:11:48 Honestly, if we are going to restrict full auto weapons, bump stocks should have been restricted as well. It’s not going to solve anything at this point but will make the folks who own them criminals.
1955 2018-12-19 17:11:47 CNBC said its gonna be dovish bro. Dovish = buy stocks bro.  Didnt you pay attention for the last 9 years?
1956 2018-12-19 17:11:24 I’m curious, has anybody heard from 2A hard liners about the DOJ banning bump stocks? I fully expected a barrage of “pry it out of my cold dead fingers” messaging, but instead, crickets. Could it possibly be that the NRA has nothing to say?
1957 2018-12-19 17:10:56 A lot clearly do not understand how bump stocks or guns even work. Including Piers.
1958 2018-12-19 17:10:42 Markets Right Now: Stocks move higher as oil price rebounds
1959 2018-12-19 17:10:40 Two stocks and only four minutes?...
1960 2018-12-19 17:09:56 YO! What is happening with this administration right now. Legislation on justice reform, banning bump stocks, & now pulling troops out of Syria. 

What is being hidden from us? Is it all smoke and mirrors or is Trump playing the left a bit. I... I just don’t get it.
1961 2018-12-19 17:09:38 @realDonaldTrump you lost votes with the bump-stocks. One shooting on the books with a bump stock. I don’t need one and don’t have a bump stock but your chipping away at the 2A.  Not good sir. You have now done more to the 2A than Obama. 
1962 2018-12-19 17:08:36 "the most significant federal infringement in the 2nd amendment in decades" LOL! It's just fucking bump stocks. It's an accessory.
1963 2018-12-19 17:07:39 Wtf no it’s not. This was a smart move and it needed to happen. There’s literally zero reason for us to have bump stocks. I’m a huge gun enthusiast but come on jfc
1964 2018-12-19 17:07:26 But I think the better point in this thread is just how dumb @Richzeoli looks with this tweet, since most of the groups he referenced do not use bump stocks to commit crimes, they use handguns
1965 2018-12-19 17:07:24 You backed off the border wall, banned bump stocks and socialized agriculture in the same week
...
Thanks? That feels weird but, yeah
1966 2018-12-19 17:07:05 It doesn’t matter whether you *feel* like automatic machine guns should be legal. They aren’t, and bump stocks by extension should be outlawed too.
1967 2018-12-19 17:06:32 probably a good opportunity to buy the -10/-12% bank stocks down today on the local stock exchange (all else equal)
1968 2018-12-19 17:06:19 Banning bump stocks will do absolutely nothing to keep children safe. It will get held up in court for years. Children will continue to die. Not because of guns, but because we have decayed as a society and raise Godless, lawless, parentless kids. Change starts at home.
1969 2018-12-19 17:06:08 @jimcramer looking for long term stocks in tech or renewables any suggestions?

1971 2018-12-19 17:05:16 You took all the stocks 
1972 2018-12-19 17:04:55 @DLoesch why no talk of the ban on bump stocks? Why no outrage? How come @GunOwners fighting it but not the @NRA
1973 2018-12-19 17:04:32 To our streets to collect bump stocks?
1974 2018-12-19 17:04:23 So what? What if a foreign government invades and hundreds of bad guys are rushing into homes? You'll wish you had bump stocks then. Also people paid taxes on it legally when buying it
1975 2018-12-19 17:03:57 this is totally pointless as it is written. a waste of paper. and it isn't enforceable, either. 99%  of mass shootings don't involve the use of 'bump stocks' anyhow.
1976 2018-12-19 17:03:55 When I worked as a secretary in a law firm I had to get advanced permission from our Conflicts Dept. to buy any stocks for my IRA. They had thousands of corporate clients, so you can imagine how THAT went!
1977 2018-12-19 17:03:52 bump stocks are being banned!!!! my little liberal heart just got a little bit more hopeful
1978 2018-12-19 17:03:44 I knew bump stocks would be banned because they look like they allow full auto fire. This is why I never bought one.

You're not going to hear much about banning bump stocks. They were gimmicks to start with. Now try banning semiautos
1981 2018-12-19 17:02:41 Out of 5,175 stocks traded on in the U.S. with market caps > $100M, 3,051 are in bear market territory (dropped 20% or more)

1983 2018-12-19 17:02:16 Fed cuts rates, stocks sell. Fed holds, stocks sell. Fed raises, stocks sell. Fed raises and says economy bullish, stocks sell. Glad we're all in agreement #FinTwit bears....where are the bulls again? $SPY $SPX $ES_F $NQ_F
1984 2018-12-19 17:02:07 YOU'RE RIGHT! People paid legit taxes when they bought their bump stocks legally! Sad. This is as bad as Bush srs "no new taxes" pledge. Trump said he'd protect the 2nd amendment!
1985 2018-12-19 17:01:58 2.5 minutes is not good but at least its still 3 stocks

1991 2018-12-19 17:00:02 I see a similar explanation around. Traditional safe havens (gold etc) are not erupting even as the stocks tank. Combined with low liquidity (volume/actual price move) and lack of real panic, perhaps large institutional money is in 100% vacation mode and this is just algos/MMs.
1992 2018-12-19 16:59:51 (4) definitely not enough to offset his INCREDIBLE power. Combos, neutral, advantage state is SO strong because of suicide (hell even disadvantage on last stocks). His one flaw is his recovery, which is bad, yes, but not as nearly as bad as people think.
1993 2018-12-19 16:59:41 You will now be a 1 term president banning bump stocks! That is as bad as Bush Srs "no new taxes" pledge! WHAT about the people who paid taxes when they legally bought bump stocks?? We have 1 incident with it and now you ban it?? Trader!
1994 2018-12-19 16:59:40 I want to buy an official konbat lightstick but it's like oos everywhere... Can y'all just make and order stocks for it??
1995 2018-12-19 16:59:10 And that won’t be enough for u DemonRats,the next step is too disarm the citizens,that’s how Nazi Germany  started, n how did that work out. U can ban something but getting them turned is is another. Do a buy back then maybe. Cash for Clunkers, what about cash for bump stocks ?
1996 2018-12-19 16:58:33 How many crimes have been committed in the US with bump stocks?  How many in NY?  Fear mongering in an attempt to strip away rights.
1997 2018-12-19 16:58:04 If the Fed raises interest rates today I'll hail them as Great Patriots finally showing some care & respect for prudent persons. 

Fed only follows debt mkts anwyway, never did set rates, & stocks going down no matter what Fed does.

God bless margin clerks for they'll be busy!!
1998 2018-12-19 16:57:48 It would really make my day if I could find some where in the uk that stocks @ProperWhiskey . unless @TheNotoriousMMA is passing by I’ll have to find a different present for my son in-law. #lastminuteshopper
1999 2018-12-19 16:57:45 In other words, it'd be the wrong way to go about investing to base it off of a clip; better to get a tip from someone in a major corporation. You could get lucky but you could also just end up losing big money. Stocks aren't cheap.  But otherwise, its easy.  Or was this sarcasm?

2002 2018-12-19 16:56:49 Yes! The government just ban bump stocks and the people who have them have 48 hours to turn them in or destroy the devices.
2003 2018-12-19 16:56:45 If anything it would mean stocks down and capital flows into the dollar. It's a suckers rally. Rate hikes = continuation of deleveraging
2004 2018-12-19 16:56:41 The fed has never raised rates while I was rockin’ these pink stocks.
2005 2018-12-19 16:56:17 A machine gun is defined as a weapon or weapon modification that results in several rounds fired with one function of the trigger- bump stocks ARE NOT machine guns. Between 2004 and 2007 a 14 inch length of shoestring alone was classified as a machine gun in the eyes of the ATF.
2006 2018-12-19 16:56:00 I mean u can as well take strong long and strong short setups or whatever. But I dont like "to hedge". when u want to hedge ur long stock plays u should ask urself first if maybe its the wrong market to be long in stocks
2007 2018-12-19 16:55:19 Paddock fired 1,100 rounds of .223 from 490 yards and hit 480 people. I remain amazed that bump stocks are that effective.

2010 2018-12-19 16:55:05 Hey, you folks who are afraid the government is coming to take your guns: you thought Obama was going to do it. He didn’t, did he? Well, Trump is doing it. He just band bump stocks. Fooled you!
2011 2018-12-19 16:54:59 I have no idea why they are doing it in the first place...Something big with Iran will put pressure on oil stocks is my best guess
2012 2018-12-19 16:54:29 its then better to stay in cash and trade overall market. I think its one of the worst things u can do have an account being long stocks à la buy and hold and hedge
2013 2018-12-19 16:53:58 Purchasing stocks is straightforward: find out company you want to invest in, find it's public name, call up a stockbroker and purchase the stock.  You can also use an e-trading app and purchase the stock.  The issue is that speculative investing usually results in a loss.

2022 2018-12-19 16:53:21 So the Senate has signed the prison reform bill, Trump has banned bump stocks, and now we are pulling out of Syria? These a decisions/policies that are not widely accepted by Republicans but appropriate and needed. Can't complain about @POTUS today. These are good things.

Commercial crude stocks fell 0.5Mb
Distillate fuel stocks fell 4.2Mb as cold weather increased usage.
2028 2018-12-19 16:52:04 The street and the financial media are framing the narrative that a dovish hike is going to be massively bullish for stocks.  The intent here is to create higher prices to sell into.
2029 2018-12-19 16:52:04 Was just thinking the same thing. Looks like they’ve pulled their bets in during past drawdowns. Smart money they are not. This to me looks like there is now way more money on the sidelines ready to chase stocks on the rebound higher.
2030 2018-12-19 16:51:36 With an 8%, it seems to tight a stop. How do I ensure am not stopped out too early but still maintain a 2% risk to capital? In terms of position size, how to determine # shares, # stocks I'd need to buy?
2031 2018-12-19 16:51:16 How tho
I explained how the ACA was good for health insurers,  stocks went up when it was passed, how was it bad? I'm listening.
2032 2018-12-19 16:50:58 So does that mean you and your buddies will be compensating those who choose to dispose of their bump stocks when they are banned?
2033 2018-12-19 16:50:35 The FOMC meeting today will set the tone for the market in 2019. I expect a dovish Fed and stocks to rise.

2035 2018-12-19 16:50:19 The risk reward is (or getting) enticing for so many stocks, why take a chance on a stock that has resistance less than 10 points away and price targets not much higher at 40x earnings?
2036 2018-12-19 16:50:18 They can use them to hide their banned bump stocks.
2037 2018-12-19 16:50:13 I know there’s a lot to get done in the next Congress, but a ban on bump stocks should be @NancyPelosi’s first priority. Dare the Senate to ignore it once it passes the House.

2041 2018-12-19 16:48:51 Imma just stay positive; I AM keeping an eye on any further NSWF developments in the web, don't get me wrong, but I have reasons to think that twitter should be safe; at least for a solid while. Especially since twitter stocks have risen quite a bit because of tumblr.
2042 2018-12-19 16:48:26 Only Index options are liquid, individual Stocks dry like desert, dont know when we will get evenly distributed liquidity.
2043 2018-12-19 16:47:58 Y’all fav holiday coming up so my gift list is as follows:

Bless me so I could bless you later in life. I always return favors
2044 2018-12-19 16:47:36 This
 This. 
   FUCKING THIS. thank you. Finally a voice of reason. It's a piece. A useless piece. That is optional and real enthusiasts and serious shooters wouldn't dare have a bump stock. No law enforcement agency or military branch has bump stocks. Petty novelty
2045 2018-12-19 16:47:10 The bump stock ban may not affect Pres Trump much concerning gun owners.

Bump stocks are the antithesis of gun use. Bump stocks are about rapid fire with no accuracy. Gun use is all about control, accuracy and safety in use of a gun for the gun owner and the gun owner's friends.

2048 2018-12-19 16:46:44 Today is Fed Day!  Stocks are Up this morning & MBS is currently Up 11bps (better pricing on interest rates), while Yields have slid to 2.81%.  This is ahead of today's announcement at 11am PST.  0.25% Rate Hike is expected.  Watch for outlook for 2019!
2049 2018-12-19 16:46:34 Where’s the Jan. 2018 Davos crowd that called cash stupid and stocks the only game in town?
2050 2018-12-19 16:46:09 I can’t wait to hear all the bad things that Dems have to say about Trump banning bump stocks.
2051 2018-12-19 16:45:45 So Trump administration bans bmp stocks and also plans on bringing all the troops currently in Syria home. Two things that should have bipartisan support across the board. Going to be very hard for the never trumpers to accept.
2052 2018-12-19 16:45:39 The NRA has repeatedly said it's no problem with a ban bump stocks. Doesn't affect guns. It should have been done immediately after the Las Vegas concert shooting massacre. If what really needs to happen is approached, the NRA will throw a complete tantrum.
2053 2018-12-19 16:45:30 @realDonaldTrump After discussing your actions on bump stocks with my coworkers you should know you have lost the gun rights and Constitutional loving crowd.  Bumper sticker coming off today.  Good Day Sir.
2054 2018-12-19 16:45:21 if kcarats wants to really boycott @pledis_17 #SEVENTEEN, they should buy all the stocks for SG and dump them here in the Philippines. SHOW PLEDIS WHAT YOU CAN DO!!!
DUMP ALL YOUR MERCHES HERE IN THE PH YESSS
2055 2018-12-19 16:44:42 I think  you have jumped the shark on this one . Followed you to learn more about stocks . Not anti trump animus
2056 2018-12-19 16:44:42 It’s a good thing @realDonaldTrump  is being a dick about bump stocks because the criminal justice reform bill and the pulling out of Syria almost had me liking the guy for a second.

Since I’ve been alive, I’ve never liked a President (at least for more than a few minutes)
2057 2018-12-19 16:44:27 You believe the PE ratios of the Fang stocks and other biggest growth stocks driving this market are justified?
2058 2018-12-19 16:44:25 Stocks going from 52 week high to 52 week low in a matter of days. Don’t know sincerely how u chart guys can cope with this

@StockCats @Hipster_Trader @jedimarkus77 @JoshManMode
2059 2018-12-19 16:44:21 Yes, more we can do to protect society as a whole like quit making excuses for bad behavior. While I see no need for bump stocks, this is a feel good oy measure like most all legislation after any tragedy.  Guns are not the problem but a society whose morals have declined are.
2060 2018-12-19 16:44:16 I’m certainly not suggesting a bottom is in. But a good indicator for individual stocks is after analysts turn sour. More down side? Sure. But $MU could floor months before the main market.
2061 2018-12-19 16:43:34 It was all started in 1987 by the "maestro" Greenspan. His protege Bernanke and then Yellen continued that legacy of equating stocks = economy mandate. Now Powell is finally trying to correct course and he is drawing fire from all quarters...
2062 2018-12-19 16:43:12 Her business is worth 900M+ & it doesn’t have stocks & partial owners, she owns all of it.
2063 2018-12-19 16:43:10 In case you didn’t know the Trump administration just banned bump stocks. Had this been anyone else Republicans would have been screaming for violation of the second amendment. Where is the outcry?
2064 2018-12-19 16:43:06 They built from low stocks. A lot of oil on water built is Iranian. China is the only place big enough that people can throw misc at and no one can argue against it
2065 2018-12-19 16:42:54 The destruction of energy stocks is a little played out.  Why can't we get destruction in the Saas space?
2066 2018-12-19 16:42:48 Stop spamming with penny stocks. Nobody cares about penny stocks

2068 2018-12-19 16:42:20 Plz explain how banning bump stocks make me a felon. I'll wait
2069 2018-12-19 16:42:10 What is your confidence based on? In the event of no deal we will have about two days before stocks of food & medicine become scarce as lorries queue up at Dover and other ports trying to enter & leave the UK.
2070 2018-12-19 16:42:04 His speechwriters are starting on the State of the Union address and he has no accomplishments. So now he averts govt shutdown, gives fed employees Christmas eve off, bans bump stocks & gets us out of Syria. He's trying to create accomplishments in the last two weeks of the year.
2071 2018-12-19 16:41:49 This will not surprise, but the numbers are stark:

52-week highs/lows in healthcare stocks:

1 high
106 lows 

per StreetAccount.
2072 2018-12-19 16:41:48 Because bump stocks suck. You can do the same thing with a belt loop.
2073 2018-12-19 16:41:40 Cam in 6 yrs probably get worst. But at current market cap and buy back speed, MU will buy back 97%!!! its stocks!
2074 2018-12-19 16:41:32 Could make a killing on playing the huge swings in company stocks he creates, but I wouldn't invest long term with him in the office. The effects of the trade war have yet to reach shelves but they will soon...
2075 2018-12-19 16:41:28 Yes may be they did or somebody in between took all the stocks , Women team were forced to use the jersey previously used by boys team, there are many factual stories like this. #IndianFootball
2076 2018-12-19 16:40:59 Trump deserves credit for his support of the First Step Act which aims to decease the number of people in prison by 50k & also banning bump stocks. Both of these things are a big deal that get lost in the drama.

2079 2018-12-19 16:40:25 i was thinking that too; i thought what's up with #FatNixon & the bump stocks ban, his cult will not be happy with that one.  i agree he is doing this, he has nothing else & he thinks he will get re-elected by doing this. i'm hoping for the continued 12 days of Muellermas 
2080 2018-12-19 16:40:14 Do the bump stocks have serial numbers? Because I know that's the issue with the magazine bans. Magazines have no serial numbers or tracking numbers so there's no way to know who has them.

2084 2018-12-19 16:39:36 Thanks for spitting in the faces of the ones who supported you @realDonaldTrump! You are wrong for banning bump stocks! Not right! Way to slap us in the face!

2087 2018-12-19 16:38:39 LOL you just argued that bump stocks make guns more inaccurate, but now banning them will prevent self-defense? Fuck right off with your silliness and lack of debate skills, liar.
2088 2018-12-19 16:38:18 You have been miss informed. 1) bump stocks do not make a machine gun.
2) machine guns are NOT illegal.
3) being necessary to the security of a free state, the RIGHT of the PEOPLE shall not be INFRINGED. Remind me where is says you have the power to strip us of our human rights?
2089 2018-12-19 16:38:08 This is the best and only “vehicle” for all actions taking by this President — looks like the family business may have some stocks ownership there as well 
2090 2018-12-19 16:37:34 More Gun Control: Trump Officially Bans Bump Stocks #preppers #prepping #survival
2091 2018-12-19 16:37:21 Giving credit where credit is due. 
1. President Trump's DOJ is banning bump stocks. 
2. President Trump is fulling withdrawing from Syria.
2092 2018-12-19 16:37:09 No, it’s not. Bump stocks are not relevant to the ability to ‘keep’ or ‘bear’ arms. 

Didnt make the argument you said I did, and you keep lying that I want to ban guns, but I own guns and I believe the 2nd grants the individual right, so you’re a liar to boot.
2093 2018-12-19 16:36:44 Anyone can make bump stocks homemade there are plenty of tutorials online and gun makers are already a step ahead with a new system called binary fire.
2094 2018-12-19 16:36:38 Some ground covered, but still exceptional problems, and too many unanswered questions...

Kudos however, and thanks for the BP stocks ban.  Overdue.
2095 2018-12-19 16:36:25 I just want to say thank you for taking a more active role in regards to guns despite all odds. I think banning bump stocks is first stop and I applaud your administration for taking the issue seriously. I say this as a victim of gun violence in the Chicago area, thank you.
2096 2018-12-19 16:35:42 Software #stocks resists the pressure in the #markets. It's the sector to look at if the pressure eases.

2098 2018-12-19 16:35:01 I will need a coherent argument as to how bump stocks in any way infringe on 2A. It only takes away a lethal functionality of some firearms, not take them off the gun shop shelves.
2099 2018-12-19 16:33:13 Today...

 Ban on bump stocks...
Criminal justice reform bill..
2100 2018-12-19 16:33:03 Not at all. Dig up Captain Mainwaring and stick him in the stocks - he called Pike “stupid boy” on numerous occasions. PS it does serve Corbyn right for being so sanctimonious.
2101 2018-12-19 16:33:02 Yeah I was thinking penny stocks and shit. It’s seems simple but I know it’s more to it...marijuana industry gone start booming soon also
2102 2018-12-19 16:32:50 dahil ba sa pare pareho sila :((( pero parang mas okay kasi di nauubusan ng stocks yung bago hehe
2103 2018-12-19 16:32:38 Hey @CollegeHumor you should do a quiz show where people have to guess whether certain things are legal or not in the US, but the joke is it’s all legal

Ideas:
- Bump Stocks
- Tasers
- Bears as pets
- Flamethrowers
- actual tanks
2104 2018-12-19 16:32:30 the trump administration banned bump stocks. i hear zero outrage from maga folks. if this had been obama, we wouldn’t hear the end of it. haha. i hate yall
2105 2018-12-19 16:32:27 It is pretty interesting to follow the #2A and read conversations. Right now regarding bump-stocks it is pretty quiet. There are about 1 per 5 minutes being outraged but if you go back to a day of a shooting it is 100+ per minute. Curiouser and curiouser.
2106 2018-12-19 16:32:23 Ya, tell your buddy who is making felons of the legal gun owners who own bump stocks 
2107 2018-12-19 16:32:04 Also didn't 45 just ban bump stocks this week?!
2108 2018-12-19 16:31:53 Bump stocks have officially been banned  progress!
2109 2018-12-19 16:31:08 OK... But it's not bump stocks that kill people...

2111 2018-12-19 16:30:23 I'm not sure how to 3D print murder, but printed bump stocks are far less capable of murder than say 3D printed knives or forcing someone to choke on a printed Benchy...
2112 2018-12-19 16:30:22 Mattel I hope your stocks go down even more.... to extinction you have dropped your morals so low with this xxxrated trash you deserve not to be in business. I will boycott and AVOID toys with your name brand in the future. Disgusting and pathetic !!!
2113 2018-12-19 16:30:20 @realDonaldTrump You are losing us Mr. President. Bump stocks, the wall. SMH.

2118 2018-12-19 16:29:25 Networth is not money in the bank...they value his worth on how Facebook stocks are trading...he can wake up a millionaire If things go South overnight...which is unlikely but ya bo worth 70 billion is basically a lie...cos he can never sell Facebook at 70 billion...
2119 2018-12-19 16:29:14 @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the attempt to remove bump stocks ownership. What will you do to enforce? Eliminate production? Amnesty event? Surveillance at gun shows/shops? #AskingforAmerica
2120 2018-12-19 16:29:09 You need stocks in the URL real shit lol , tell smack to stop playing
2121 2018-12-19 16:29:04 No one dislikes the Trump Administration more than I do ... but consider this a personal thank you from me for banning bump stocks and also withdrawing troops from Syria. Both decisions will save lives; I'm 'bout that action.
2122 2018-12-19 16:29:02 Let me ask a better question, Why ban bump stocks ?
2123 2018-12-19 16:28:24 We're rolling it out early 2019!
2124 2018-12-19 16:28:01 Trump made taxes lower than ever before in history, I'm not paying any of those higher taxes, you want to take away my bump stocks and I'm not buying it

2126 2018-12-19 16:27:25 If Republicans treated abortions like Bump Stocks then we would never have another abortion in America again.
2127 2018-12-19 16:27:17 I have a friend who lives in Colombia. Does anyone know if she can open a brokerage account from there and buy US or Canadian stocks?
2128 2018-12-19 16:27:04 Do you hear yourself you ding ding? Your #TraitorTrump signed the bill. He authorized this ban and had even said so after the massacre of more than 70 people by a crazed repuke shooter with bump stocks!
2129 2018-12-19 16:27:00 For fun I put together my own version of a "diversified" portfolio. Mostly long via stocks (over-allocated in $MSFT, $CRM, and some REITS), hedged by Munis and long-term Treasuries, and a couple put contracts on $SNAP

2140 2018-12-19 16:24:48 Sir after reading your tweets I have learnt a thing always buy consumer stocks and average it after they correct 15-20% from their high . Invested in pidilite Asian paints Godrej consumer nestle last month after they corrected 15-20% from their high will hold forever
2141 2018-12-19 16:24:04 Sheesh losing to the brown wall really hurt your stocks huh
2142 2018-12-19 16:23:41 The percentage of investors who can sell stocks today and have the stomach to buy back in a deeper selloff is very small. If you don’t have the stomach to buy today (not saying you should), you likely won’t later.
2143 2018-12-19 16:23:33 You want to regulate accessories like machine guns, this is what happens. Federal law already (unconstitutionally) bans all machine guns manufactured after 1986. So when you ask for "additional regulation" of bump stocks, this is EXACTLY what you're asking for.
2144 2018-12-19 16:23:07 I'm as anti-Trump as anyone, but you maybe can contribute 50 deaths annually to bump stocks (and that is only bc of Vegas). Crazy people will continue to find new ways to commit mass murder, and banning certain objects ain't gonna stop it.
2145 2018-12-19 16:23:00 Interesting to see how stocks that were hot potatoes on Monday as sellers couldn't dump them fast enough, suddenly jack back to the upside...typical of this algo-driven market...
2146 2018-12-19 16:22:25 With the ban of bumper stocks, I expected my timeline would be full of outcry from all the NRA, ammosexual types. Oddly enough, it's very quiet. I imagine if Obama had done the same, the revolution would already be underway.
2147 2018-12-19 16:22:00 Instead of fighting to stop the ban on bump stocks why aren’t we fighting to repeal the Hughes Amendment and reopen the firearms registry ?
2148 2018-12-19 16:21:54 At least I find it stocks me up on bubble wrap, which is useful for my suitcase imports
2149 2018-12-19 16:21:35 Oh crap they banned bump-stocks? But I’m a really shitty hunter and I need to fire off 70 or 80 rounds before I hit a deer
2150 2018-12-19 16:21:34 No one cares about bump stocks.

2155 2018-12-19 16:20:41 I read the ATF ruling in bump stocks so you don't have to...

It's worse than you think.

Instead of deeming them as accessories that illegally convert a semiautomatic to a machinrgun, the device itself is a machine gun.

Idiocy.
2156 2018-12-19 16:20:32 Interestingly, the law doesn't grandfather in already-purchased bump stocks, which seems to set a precedent for the government to seize arms acquired legally by private citizens in the past.  The resulting cognitive dissonance among the base is probably breathtaking to behold.
2157 2018-12-19 16:20:15 Right, because banning bump stocks will stop criminals from finding a way to kill lots of people. Do criminals obey laws?
2158 2018-12-19 16:20:04 Damn. Bump stocks is a sword you'll fall on?
2159 2018-12-19 16:19:52 Look at the leading stocks of this year during their melt up runs... very little  volatility, they were easy to hold.  Now they are bouncing all over the place.  This is not a hold- able market.  And scalping doesnt interest me..

2166 2018-12-19 16:18:32 1/2 US small cap stocks have had a tough run since their late August highs, down 21% from that high water mark. Does that steep drop in US-centric names portend a 2019 #recession? Short answer: “No”.
2167 2018-12-19 16:17:42 Millions of workers have 401k or money invested in stocks. They benefit as well, at lower % obviously than C-suite.   The missing component is unions at the table.  Walmart, Amazon, McD’s, etc need to be unionized.
2168 2018-12-19 16:17:32 honestly, the only reason i didn’t is it was late and I didn’t have the right stocks and brushes on my laptop, so i just worked with what i had thank you for your feedback
2169 2018-12-19 16:16:51 Add to this that they found time to ban bump stocks with a @GOP controlled House, Senate and White House, but couldn't be bothered with NATIONAL CONCEALED CARRY RECIPROCITY. I hope they all get "Primaried" in the next election.

2173 2018-12-19 16:16:30 I agree but bump stocks isn't starting anywhere.

Can tell from experience, legal guns in the hands of regular folks is the most powerful defense vs bad ppl w/guns.

The safest bar in the neighborhood is always the one cops drink at. Why? Cause everyone knows they're all armed.
2174 2018-12-19 16:16:24 Not mad, just a little disappointed. The wall is not his fault, but his ban on bumpfire stocks will not play out in his favor.
2175 2018-12-19 16:16:00 SIR DONALD...Why not sell bonds or stocks somehow to pay for the wall?  Americans need only apply.   I am sure the money would be provided....Your business mind can shape our country, to what it was intended to be...stop playing with the fat jackasses of congress...
2176 2018-12-19 16:15:47 It has come to my attn that some Pacific sports fishing folk believe #salmon stocks are low due to seals and sea lions eating them. They’re actively executing these animals because of it. This has been happening for decades. WTF is wrong w/ ppl?

2177 2018-12-19 16:15:41 Bump stocks could have been a useful tool for a citizen if their government became tyrannical and turned on them, which has happened endless times in history. This may be new information to young people since real history is no longer taught in schools.
2178 2018-12-19 16:15:09 That's what I'm saying too! Good luck to them trying to confiscate anything of mine. I don't own bump stocks, they are not needed to shoot fast anyway. This ban is a joke. But good luck to them if they think they are coming in my home to even see if I own them. It's BS.
2179 2018-12-19 16:15:04 Banning bump stocks made it through the @GOP controlled House, Senate and @POTUS, but not National Concealed Carry Reciprocity. I hope they all get "Primaried" in the next election.
2180 2018-12-19 16:15:00 F bump stocks
2181 2018-12-19 16:15:00 The few stocks that have broken out on heavy volume and offered proper entry areas up until now, most have either failed, or at best, continue to struggle. Also, there are quite a few names carving out wide and loose bases, which tend to be highly failure prone. $SPX $COMPQ

2183 2018-12-19 16:14:46 @Surgeon_General is is true that you own stocks for any of the following: Altria, Imperial, Reynolds, Phillip Morris, or British American Tobacco?
2184 2018-12-19 16:14:46 Never say never. @realDonaldTrump gave instructions to ban Bump stocks by the ATF and now he’s on board to pass these Unconstitutional Red Flag Laws. 2019 looks like it’s gonna be a fight for our rights toward both sides.

2194 2018-12-19 16:13:13 Banning bump stocks is unconstitutional. (Personally, I see no merit in owning one. Seems like a good way to waste ammo.) 
The problem is at least twofold: 1. allowing govt to control personal property & 2. infringement on right to bear arms. Bad precedent!
2195 2018-12-19 16:13:02 Learning each day about stocks and trading.
2196 2018-12-19 16:12:41 I thought you masturbated with bump stocks, now you're into walls?
2197 2018-12-19 16:12:35 Just got my email from Atf officially banning bump stocks! Good job Whitaker! Now let's start a conversation about magazines and bullets.
2198 2018-12-19 16:12:00 I can assure you am not plastic. Backing him or not is your decision. Am for Club's overall betterment. Stocks rose on news of his sacking!! So you are alone on that side.

2201 2018-12-19 16:11:32 fools. to the stocks
2202 2018-12-19 16:11:14 I believe the better question would be, what is the basis for allowing bump stocks? You cannot argue that the American forefathers had them in mind when crafting the 2nd amendment 
2203 2018-12-19 16:10:33 So true, Walter. If the stocks don't get a bump, I will not be able to retire and live my dream of traveling are great country in my RV. 
The democants will probably ban RVs next because they don't want patriot's to have fun.
2204 2018-12-19 16:10:15 Agreed, and anyone that knows how to use a gun knows bump stocks are useless anyway.

2206 2018-12-19 16:09:30 Removing Bump Stocks are going to make a rifle five times more dangerous.
Thus in the process infringing on America's second amendment rights.
2207 2018-12-19 16:09:13 My hair salon stocks little bags of peanuts and almonds on their beverage table next to the coffee, etc., which is truly genius because some of us have hair that takes 3-4 hours sometimes, and we need those proteins and fats to get us through
2208 2018-12-19 16:08:51 Reminder! 
From Dec 2017, Trump says, "DOW RISES 5000 POINTS ON THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the Tax Cut Bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size.
2209 2018-12-19 16:08:44 Those markets are similar in the sense that if you are a smaller individual investor, you can take advantage of that. Investing in a handful of single-family or even duplex/triplex properties can work. Its similar to working in small/micro stocks.
2210 2018-12-19 16:08:05 The big oversight is that homeownership is both a home + investments. Most models show  renters paying rent then investing in stocks, but most renters have little leftover. Certainly nothing close to a mortgage size investment.
2211 2018-12-19 16:08:00 My marijuana stocks are on the climb. Keep rollin and tokin people
2212 2018-12-19 16:07:41 Not a smartphone or CBD company. Fair question. If you look over the shareholders guide you will see we are a telecom and FinTech software company - distributing products to C- stores. When we distribute candy and auto parts...those are just more products through the pipeline.
2213 2018-12-19 16:07:26 Dyt that it says something about the EU that if there is a genuine concern over med stocks, which I absolutely do not Believe, they would rather not help or allay the fears of uk residents and instead make only plans for financial sector derivatives. Self serving mooks.
2214 2018-12-19 16:07:04 I give up. I keep spending money just to order ARMY BOMB V3 on Online shops and They don’t even have stocks so im waiting for my money to be refunded. And if I spend another 2k plus i’m not going to be able to save enough money for the Concert  I’ll wait for my refunds nalang//
2215 2018-12-19 16:06:42 Like most, i think the bump stocks are dumb and wouldnt waste a penny on one. 
OTH, its interesting to see how 'the real shooters' are reacting to this and are fine with being made felons by the stroke of a pen
2216 2018-12-19 16:06:42 Get a degree/College is a waste

Wake up at 4 am/Sleep a full 8 hours

Real Estate is king/Stocks are the way to wealth

The fact that so many ‘experts’ disagree proves there are many paths to success.

Anyone who tells you theirs is the only way is full of shit.
2217 2018-12-19 16:06:39 DM@GdaytoYou I am so glad you are back. I was already short the stocks that you have shorted but I always feel better about the trades when you see the same things I do. Also you are a joy to follow! Always so positive. It is refreshing!
2218 2018-12-19 16:06:31 In a market like this, you're getting moves in 1-2 weeks that you would typically see in 2-3 months and moves in 2-3 months that you would typically see in 1-2 yrs. Look at $GE for ex, just bounced 20% in a week. Lower your typical duration that you hold stocks for
2219 2018-12-19 16:06:31 @NRA Disappointed with you. Haven’t gotten National Carry done and @realDonaldTrump is banning bump stocks. Age limits are being raised to 21. Get your game together or lose me as a member. 
@MrColionNoir @DLoesch
2220 2018-12-19 16:06:30 Here’s and idea, how bout the NRA pay for the wall? They better do it now before all the profits from those “Bump-Stocks” goes away next year.  In the meantime, why don’t you go make another Botox appointment? Better hurry or Ann Coulter might get the last appt b4 XMAS
2221 2018-12-19 16:06:27 Hysteria led to irrational info about bump stocks. The left has people thinking the gun fires itself, without a human, if a bumpstock is used.
2222 2018-12-19 16:06:20 As an avid outdoorsman, hunter, and responsible gun owner,  I believe in the second amendment and it shall not be infringed upon.  I do however agree that Bump Stocks should be banned.  What I don’t agree with, is the government being REactive rather than PROactive.
2223 2018-12-19 16:06:12 Yes and so many new businesses and stocks to own over time. The innovation and growth is the big picture reason to own stocks for the long term. Betting on capitalism to continue.
2224 2018-12-19 16:06:12 Warren Buffet once said be greedy when others are fearful. As the #StockMarket has been anything but delivering for #investors lately I’m curious to see how things will play out after the #FederalReserve meeting. Further, I remain highly bullish on #energy and #Banking #stocks.
2225 2018-12-19 16:05:57 I guess it’s a similar logic to believing banning things that you’re afraid of will make them go away, like gun violence, or bump stocks? Kind of like we made drugs illegal and they’re no longer a menace to society?
2226 2018-12-19 16:05:38 Think this is key today  - BUZZ-Prison stocks drop after new law to reduce sentences for some inmates - Reuters News
2227 2018-12-19 16:05:35 About half of Americans own no stocks in any form.  The top 10% owns something like 80%+.
2228 2018-12-19 16:05:33 Completely disagree. Markets rising into Fed, especially Gold, and dollar falling, increases the risk of disappointment and reversal and then some. Stocks could rally further in the ST but they are the last to figure it out. "IF" the #Fed disappoints.

2231 2018-12-19 16:05:23 I'm not. Bump Stocks were gonna get banned anyway. Helping SA countries has been happening as long as I've been alive. This whole wall compromise is a rope-a-dope. Just watch.
2232 2018-12-19 16:04:44 Which stocks
2233 2018-12-19 16:04:24 Trump just announced a law to ban bump stocks in the USA! Actually a good move by Trump! Let's keep going with these tighter gun laws!
2234 2018-12-19 16:04:12 With all eyes on the Federal Reserve’s policy decision, #WellsFargo warned that any aggressive comment from Chairman Jerome Powell could worsen a sell-off in U.S. stocks.
2235 2018-12-19 16:03:58 Banning the bump stocks isn't really the issue I don't think. I see it as a If you give a mouse a cookie type of situation but could be wrong.
2236 2018-12-19 16:03:54 Stocks like ACC went up from a few 100s to 10,000!!
2237 2018-12-19 16:03:29 And on cue here comes the military industrial complex to argue for perpetual war. Pulling out of Syria is bad for their profits. Gauranteed that anyone arguing to stay in Syria has stocks in Lockheed Boeing GD or something.
2238 2018-12-19 16:02:40 He's just trying to rattle the markets so his investment guy can short defense company stocks.
2239 2018-12-19 16:02:39 Banning bump stocks is not logical gun control. In other news banning bump stocks will not save more lives.

2247 2018-12-19 16:00:54 So in a weeks time Trump caves on the border wall, again, and bans bump stocks. Total awesomeness 
2248 2018-12-19 16:00:50 This week the Trump administration:
- Banned Bump Stocks
- Got a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill to the senate
- Started withdrawing troops from Syria

He’s not my favorite president ever either but does the guy get any credit?
2249 2018-12-19 16:00:22 Right now Trump is doing everything in his power to get Trump out of there.

Prison reform, wasting money on foreign aid and banning bump stocks aren't what I voted for-and if we're going to drive over a cliff, we should put the pedal to the medal and be done with it.
2250 2018-12-19 16:00:11 An illustration of the disparity of drug laws in America.  Big Meech got 30 years for dist cocaine, a schedule 2 drug.

2251 2018-12-19 16:00:11 Bump stocks gone!!!! One more step closer to more safety in our country.  Hahahahaha. NRA loses another round.  Humanity scores a point.
2252 2018-12-19 15:59:34 The broker comments "At the current price, the shares offer a generous 7%+ yield (FY19e 7.3%) despite consistent earnings performance & revenues backed by relationships with blue chip insurers; one of our Dividend Elite stocks. The dividend is underpinned by 100% payout policy."
2253 2018-12-19 15:59:22 And that's why pro-2A folks have resisted "common sense" gun legislation for decades. Because it will not stop at bump stocks or magazine bans or the like, there will always be more demands.
2254 2018-12-19 15:58:52 Fuck $MU. Why does it drag down other stocks like $NVDA & $AMD.
2255 2018-12-19 15:58:45 I'm a huge 2A supporter and gun enthusiast...bump stocks serve no practical purpose in my opinion. Fun to shoot sometimes, but theres need for them in any real world use outside of mass shooting situations. Just my opinion
2256 2018-12-19 15:58:07 An "olive branch" is more than "not one bit" and deals don't need to be reached - "Shall not be infringed."  My rights don't need backdoor deals.  They don't need negotiated.  They need protected.  Period. over 500k bump stocks in circulation.
2257 2018-12-19 15:58:01 It's keeping the cat busy with the laser pointer. Bump stocks don't matter. They aren't important. Just a bone to throw to the fascist left.
2258 2018-12-19 15:57:35 Stocks running up into the Fed decision. The last two hours of trading are going to be VERY interesting.
2259 2018-12-19 15:57:19 We don’t care? Bump stocks are a stupid gimmick.

I’ve tried one. They’re fun for exactly one magazine, then you realize they totally ruin the accuracy of the rifle, and you throw it away.

2261 2018-12-19 15:56:58 @realDonaldTrump 

If you allow bump stocks that were legally purchased to be taken from Americans. You will lose in 2020! Then the democrats will put you in prison! Don’t forget who put you in the Whitehouse.... #gunowners

2270 2018-12-19 15:54:29 Trump signs order banning bump stocks ! You have to give credit where credit is due.. NRA is silent !!!
2271 2018-12-19 15:54:10 Trump Administration: Bans bump stocks.

Trump, the next day: Yo get these teacher's aides some fucking gats we ain't playin' around here no more.
2272 2018-12-19 15:54:09 The President complied with complaints of the Democratic Party about bump stocks. Do you not think for one minute that he already knew that it was unconstitutional? Point being made “he complied”’ the truth is out, the US Constitution  has the final say.
2273 2018-12-19 15:54:01 Trump is banning bump stocks for guns !!! Trump is going to take our guns !!!

$BIDU
$BA
$TSLA
Be careful
2278 2018-12-19 15:51:53 A special license is needed to own a fully automatic rifle. Bump stocks replicate full-automatic firing. So Banning them is appropriate.
2279 2018-12-19 15:51:49 @realDonaldTrump taking away are bump stocks huh? Really? What's next our guns. You want your base not to like you? good start. You're losing support today my friend.
2280 2018-12-19 15:51:37 His speechwriters are starting on the State of the Union address and he has no accomplishments. So now he averts govt shutdown, gives fed employees Christmas eve off, bans bump stocks & gets us out of Syria. He's trying to create accomplishments in the last two weeks of the year.

2285 2018-12-19 15:50:18 Stabilizing braces were specifically designed for people with disabilities, such as myself, to allow us to use these firearms. They're not stocks, nor are they effective in that capacity. They're flexible rubber, they can't achieve a good shoulder weld.
2286 2018-12-19 15:50:14 @realDonaldTrump My family and I love you Mr. President and support you all the way. I wan't to remind you though that our 2nd Amendment rights should not be eroded. ATF says bump stocks are not firearms and though I don't have use for them it's a another chip away at our 2A!
2287 2018-12-19 15:50:11 Hope is not a method but stocks love it.
2288 2018-12-19 15:50:10 @AppleSupport The last iOS refresh of the Stocks App is not even functional. Stocks don’t refresh and require manual clicks to get a current (or as close to) quote. When adding a new stock, it doesn’t automatically go to it on the list. Did anyone beta test this before rollout?
2289 2018-12-19 15:50:04 Yep, congress doesn't like it when their stocks take a hit.
2290 2018-12-19 15:49:35 Tired of my stocks looking like they do. But I’m investing for the long run. Buy technology stocks you guys.
2291 2018-12-19 15:49:25 Bump stocks banned.  I can bump fire with my thumb and belt loop. What’s next?  Cut our thumbs off???
2292 2018-12-19 15:49:21 His speechwriters are starting on the State of the Union address and he has no accomplishments. So now he averts govt shutdown, gives fed employees Christmas eve off, bans bump stocks & gets us out of Syria. He's trying to create accomplishments in the last two weeks of the year.
2293 2018-12-19 15:48:46 So, banning bump stocks made it through the @GOP controlled House, Senate and @POTUS, but not National Concealed Carry Reciprocity. I hope you all get "Primaried" in the next election. Bunch of lying RINO's.

2295 2018-12-19 15:48:38 Shorting stocks is much more difficult than jumping hot tech stocks in a bubble.  Generally short-selling is for more sophisticated/experienced investors who understand risk-management. I've been publishing the Short Seller's Journal since Dec 2015 and have seen

2299 2018-12-19 15:47:26 The Trump admin moved to ban bump stocks............... very interesting given his base and could mean a lot of different things. Can’t wait for all the juicy content this generates
2300 2018-12-19 15:47:23 Police wise, this has been a great week for the @realDonaldTrump administration:
- Withdrawal of troops from Syria;
- A new rule has been issued banning bump stocks COMPLETELY;
- The US Senate passed the criminal justice reform bill.
2301 2018-12-19 15:47:17 I think the ATF purposely took steps to cover their own but with the wording of this mandated change. The very wording of it excludes the function of bump stocks. I expect to see the ATF stand in court and say they were told to make a rule that included the words bump stocks

2303 2018-12-19 15:46:24 I don't have concerns with the ad. I think it's hilarious that you are running ads to encourage retail investors to short stocks in order to generate commissions for Schwab.  Some will get lucky and make some money. But most will impale themselves on margin calls.
2304 2018-12-19 15:46:16 Yeah so what, "we mostly owe ourselves" we can just get the Fed to buy American's debt. Hell they've got $4.5 trillion on their books what's $4 trillion more gonna do?  The Fed can also start buying stocks, goods and services to boot right @QTRResearch?  Problem solved! 
2305 2018-12-19 15:45:58 "your beloved Trump"

Points for the nice try at baiting, LOL.

I told you in our DM's (MONTHS AGO) about Gun Control that I support banning Bump Stocks & high capacity magazines w/ a Grandfather clause.
Look it up.

2307 2018-12-19 15:45:45 I rewarded them by buying a few stocks.
2308 2018-12-19 15:45:44 I’m fully aware of what bump stocks are—and they were not specifically banned. Trump specifically banned them. You call it “closing a loophole,” I call it “unwarranted government infringement of rights.” I don’t really see what else there is to discuss.
2309 2018-12-19 15:45:28 Under the GOP (Trump and Ryan) the deficit is projected to be $1 trillion by 2020 thanks mostly to the massive tax cut for the uber wealthy (maybe you are one of them) and large corporations. That idiot, Jordan, voted for the tax cuts. CEO bought back massive # of stocks.
2310 2018-12-19 15:45:20 Their Ginger Beer is great (Costco stocks it in my area) - I can only imagine the root beer has to be on par.
2311 2018-12-19 15:45:06 You are treading on shaky ground banning bump stocks, what about auto triggers out there that are legal? What about skilled marksman with fast trigger fingers? You waste ammo with auto fire any way. True gun owners know its one shot one kill , you don’t auto fire on a deer.

2317 2018-12-19 15:44:12 bump stocks are not arms, they are an accessory.
2318 2018-12-19 15:43:45 No one in his "Base" is against law and order. As for bump stocks? Just another stupid nothing the left can turn into a scary monster. I can do exactly the same thing with my thumb and beltloop
2319 2018-12-19 15:43:27 I'm not sure we this is the reason for the selling pressure.  All Weed Stocks have performed terrible after legalization day in Canada.

2347 2018-12-19 15:36:34 A ban on bump stocks will do nothing to make people safer. All you have done is infringe on the people’s Second Amendment Rights. You said you wouldn’t do this but here we are. Don’t forget Most gun owners voted for you.
2348 2018-12-19 15:36:24 I just gotta come back to this.  Who just banned bump stocks?  Hmmm by executive action?  I wonder what you MAGAts would be saying if that were President Obama

2381 2018-12-19 15:29:29 The reason to allow any behavior ever is because ”freedom”. When we take freedoms away from people, there had better be a really damn good reason. You can't ban everything that kills people or you’d have to also ban cars and food.

Having said that, I’m for banning bump stocks.

2389 2018-12-19 15:27:40 5% stock position sizing would probably be akin to a mean coin flip total win / total loss of 0.5% size (I would guess that 95% of your stock trades are expected to produce a win/loss of less than +\- 10%?). Coin flips are obviously an easier distribution to visualize than stocks

2392 2018-12-19 15:26:28 And your president just banned bump stocks.  The same thing liberals proposed.
2393 2018-12-19 15:26:20 Bump stocks are not the problem! Banning them is catering to the gun activists!
Mr President you have done an amazing job! Please protect ALL of our 2nd Amendment RIGHTS! Love the Trump’s and all you do for our country!
2394 2018-12-19 15:26:19 Except this wasn't a fight. There was literally no reason to do this, because if it went through the legislature it wouldn't have passed. It was a regulatory change. Trump banned bump stocks and threw gun owners under the bus for absolutely nothing.

2396 2018-12-19 15:26:00 OK... so how does the banning of bump stocks benefit the entire nation?
What you should be questioning is whether the “art of the deal” means a deal at any cost... yes?
2397 2018-12-19 15:25:49 Between banning bump stocks and now withdrawing from Syria and leaving the Kurds for the Turkish slaughterhouse, is the Trump Admin trying to do as much as they can to now anger the right? If there is one way to lose support this is how you do it...
2398 2018-12-19 15:25:42 Trump administration moves to ban bump stocks, wishing they could bump up stocks
2399 2018-12-19 15:25:38 People all over the nation are rushing to their nearest law enforcement agencies to turn in their bump stocks! LOL! What a f****** idiot! He's trying so hard to make people like him now but too little way too late.
2400 2018-12-19 15:25:37 How many mass murders were done using bump stocks? I recall only one, but even that is too many, of course. I still maintain, however, that mentally unstable people kill,  not guns.
2401 2018-12-19 15:25:06 Gotta admit it's pretty amusing that just as noose is tightening we're getting criminal justice reform, a federal ban on bump stocks, and a withdrawal of troops from Syria. I too only do my fucking job when I think I'm about to be fired.

2404 2018-12-19 15:24:53 Lots of stocks moving up on no volume. Very suspect.
2405 2018-12-19 15:24:43 How can you still have hate or dislike for that man? Legalize hemp, prison reform, and now banning bump stocks. Those are all positives for society. But you still hating.
2406 2018-12-19 15:24:40 Trump been making some smart bipartisan decisions lately. Syria, bump stocks, criminal justice reform.
2407 2018-12-19 15:24:23 As it should be. Bump stocks are a silly gimmick, a toy. But the government banning things shouldn’t be taken lightly. Only a matter of time before someone is dead because they refused to surrender their property.

2409 2018-12-19 15:24:14 I get banning the sale of bump stocks. However, I do not approve of requiring people to turn them in. Btw it's not illegal to have a machine gun depending its date.
2410 2018-12-19 15:24:13 Haven't heard much about Prof #Schiller's #CAPE numbers. Next year we will not have the 2008 crisis year's numbers being part of the calculation... Interesting. Revaluing stocks on PE might be a big subject of chat in January, February 2019
2411 2018-12-19 15:24:05 No matter what you think of bump stocks or gun laws, you should recognize that letting any administration, let alone this one, drastically change federal law by administrative redefinition of language clearly defined in black letter law since 1934 sets a dangerous precedent.
2412 2018-12-19 15:23:53 They got rid of the bum stocks, that's a good step.

Gun shows make it extremely easy to buy guns "legally" without strainous background check. We can also ban those. 

There a lot of other things that could deal with background checks into a house hold not just the gun owner.
2413 2018-12-19 15:23:11 I am aware of the bump stocks ban, some people say they suck or it’s useful, but I am kinda disappointed in my President right now. I am a very strong Trump supporting conservative, but something has to change by 2019-2020!

2426 2018-12-19 15:19:54 How is it possible the BATF and DOJ are being allowed to ban bump stocks calling them machine guns without Congressional approval? They aren’t machine guns, they are an accessory to semi-auto rifles. Slippery slope my friends....all I have to say is “Come and Take It”.
2427 2018-12-19 15:19:50 He is desperate to control the narrative.  Banning bump stocks and pulling out of Syria diverts attention from the Mueller investigation, his charity foundation, and all those close to him who may now be cooperating with DOJ.  Not going to work.

2429 2018-12-19 15:19:36 My point was simply that its insane that it expends political capital at all.  Have you seen how bump stocks operate and their rate of fire? There is no justifiable or good faith reason civilians should have access to them.

2432 2018-12-19 15:18:58 @realDonaldTrump I did not vote for you so you could:
- move the embassy to Jerusalem
- ban bump stocks
- reform prison for Blacks
- give billions of dollars of aid to Central America & Mexico

Build the Wall, deport them all. Or don't get re-elected.
2433 2018-12-19 15:18:55 Trump has done everything he can to make this country move along at a growing rate. We have a fed constantly raising interest rates which have slowed the economy down.

2438 2018-12-19 15:17:52 Isn't it likely that there's a connection between steeper discounts on newly-issued leveraged loans and the pervasive weakness in bank stocks? Do we know who the largest issuers/sellers of leveraged loans are, and were they booking sizable gains on the sale of freshly-made loans?
2439 2018-12-19 15:17:49 Nah. LOTS more people own mags with 10+ rounds than bump stocks. Numbers matter.

2447 2018-12-19 15:16:41 "Shall not be infringed".. 
I agree with the finding..that "bump stocks" convert semi-auto to full auto, a technicality..a "modification".
However, the 2'nd amendment prohibits ALL restrictions on "bearing arms".
Even "gun registration" is a violation of Constitutional Law.

2449 2018-12-19 15:16:28 Now turn in your bump stocks!
2450 2018-12-19 15:16:22 Bump stocks are stupid, good riddance. But now I'm thinking about what other pieces of plastic in a certain shape are illegal to possess? I'm sure there's tons of 'em.
2451 2018-12-19 15:16:20 Baloney, that’s a nonsense analogy. 

Bump stocks are not guns or arms. If you think it’s ‘authoritarian’ to ban something that helped a dude mass-murder 50 human beings and is only made to do what it did, fine, but it’s not protected by the 2nd.
2452 2018-12-19 15:15:57 75% of the world’s food stocks are made from 12 plants and five animal species. Think about that the next time you and your friends can’t decide on what to order. #WednesdayWisdom

2479 2018-12-19 15:10:00 Risk is also selling when a financial crisis happens. If you are in all stocks and you are 85 and need income, then you made a poor allocation choice. If you are in mostly stocks and you are 50 and not retiring for 15-20 years, you can generally wait it out.

2494 2018-12-19 15:06:49 @DLoesch Hi there, am a big admirer. What's the @NRA's official line on the bump-stock ban? Even though many don't have strong opinions about bump-stocks per se, the precedent is troubling.
2495 2018-12-19 15:06:47 NRA put out a call right after the Vegas shooting to ban bump stocks.  The vast majority of gun right community agrees with that call.

That's a good place to be IMO.
2502 2018-12-19 15:05:42 Now that we have banned bump stocks, we should also ban bone saws.
2503 2018-12-19 15:05:30 @realDonaldTrump Mr, President, your losing a great portion of your base by selling out on the bump stock issue.  Its not bump stocks per se but the fact that you did not keep your promise.  You infringed on our rights and 2020 is going to be a disaster.

2530 2018-12-19 14:58:42 Also I love the fact that Marlboro is buying up MJ stocks. Big tobacco and big Pharma will live on while those who need stronger medications will be denied. I'm all for MJ and MMJ but one size never fits all but they sure are trying to leave us no choice.
2531 2018-12-19 14:58:35 My "shift" occurred when I found out that Trump is going through with a bump stock ban. If he's willing to blame & ban bump stocks (1/2)
2532 2018-12-19 14:58:19 I want jail time. Or at least convictions with guilty pleas in court and big, big, big, big, fines. Say 4 billion. That should bankrupt them. Martha Stewart went to jail for talking stocks at a party for christ's sake. What makes #Iwannafuckivankaman immune?

2534 2018-12-19 14:57:58 Funny bump stocks doesn't really alter the firing of the weapon. An AR15 doesn't have that much recoil any will trained person can maintain good accuracy while rapidly firing an AR15. But you can have the win over bump stocks we'll keep our guns
2535 2018-12-19 14:57:49 I seldom have anything nice to say about about Trump, but Criminal Justice Reform and banning bump stocks are good things. so there.
2536 2018-12-19 14:57:09 I still support him. The wall is not his fault. Bumpfire stocks will be a black mark against him though.

2539 2018-12-19 14:56:41 The NRA actually petitioned the Obama Admin to not allow bump stocks to be sold, but they signed off on it anyway. Do a search
2540 2018-12-19 14:56:12 Uhh nah cars are very different from guns. I mean bump stocks aren’t really a right. Chill y’all can still have your guns. Can’t you make a little sacrifice for the good of society
2541 2018-12-19 14:56:09 1/ The Chinese gov't is much more concerned with issues other than Ag commodities when it comes to the Trade Deal, i.e. intellectual property, energy, tech etc.  They are willing to make concessions on SB purchases that may not make sense from a timing or stocks perspective...

2552 2018-12-19 14:53:34 #2A person here. Bump stocks are largely a waste and should be banned. From a hunting perspective, they make an accurate weapon inaccurate. Their only use is to make a semi auto fire quicker with less accuracy but still slower than a automatic weapon. Seems pointless really.

2557 2018-12-19 14:52:31 1) bump stocks not needed to protect your freedom 2) govt shut down doesn’t work when 85% of govt is still funded.  Wall can be built by military 3)its prison reform, modeled after Texas.   Add to this is your support of RINO McSally.  What’s up with you?!  0-4 today.
2558 2018-12-19 14:52:20 Bump stocks are probably very easy to produce on 3D printers.  This problem is not going away.
2559 2018-12-19 14:51:50 Banning of bump stocks and criminal justice reform in the past 24 hours...I can get used to the idea that Washington DC can actually govern and function.
2560 2018-12-19 14:51:47 And just like that the price of bump stocks will go through the roof. In the next 90 days before that goes in to effect bumpstocks will be sold out just in time for Christmas. That will become the gun enthusiasts most wanted present from Santa

2563 2018-12-19 14:50:58 Hey @bpshow Two words come to my mind when it comes to Criminal Justice Reform and Banning Bump Stocks. Barack Obama because he’s was fighting for both before Trump knew what it was.P.S Get a clue Bill You should know better. @steakhousegirl

2566 2018-12-19 14:50:27 The true dangerous devices are the large magazine assault rifles themselves! Bump stocks are basically window dressing in the big picture. Politicians simply don't want to offend their NRA donors! Do any of you have a spine? Take off your blinders, and help the endangered kids.

2576 2018-12-19 14:48:08 Common decency would dictate that you would be willing to give up your bump stocks and assault rifles so that our children can be safe leaving home.
2577 2018-12-19 14:48:06 You might be right, but his arguments are also compelling. While there's a lot of overhang supply, if stocks suddenly reverse ppl could start FOMOing again. Keeping an open mind.

2582 2018-12-19 14:47:00 The stock markets, as usual, open scared in positive territory, only to turn negative when unfavorable discourses are being waved or toyed around in  investor's mind. In the stock markets, nothing is safe to secure stocks to own until the bell closed.
2583 2018-12-19 14:46:56 Who here, reading comments is really foolish enough to believe criminals will turn in bumps stocks? All you did was create another black market item.
2584 2018-12-19 14:46:23 I’ve been trying to figure out here in N.J. that there is outrage over limiting to 10 rounds vs 12 but nothing about bump stocks... why?
2585 2018-12-19 14:46:14 Bump stocks make semiautomatic guns mimic automatic guns. I just watched a video of an AR-15 shooting 40 rounds in 2.5 seconds. Do you really think people should be able to do that?
2586 2018-12-19 14:46:01 Well with this tweet. To give Trump credit for criminal justice reform and banning bump stocks after all of the mess he has created to words come to my mind towards these two important bills Barack Obama because he was fighting for this not Trump. @steakhousegirl

2589 2018-12-19 14:45:09 Dovish hike today. Stocks knee jerk higher, then start drifting lower and eventually break the lows of early 2018. Then TIMBER!
2590 2018-12-19 14:45:09 That is a point worth litigating. I don’t know where the courts would end up on that. 

But there is NO question that a law banning bump stocks is constitutional.

And the GOA guy said he was suing to protect constitutional rights of gun owners.

2593 2018-12-19 14:44:43 I'm not blaming him for that I'm blaming him for signing off on the bump stock ban. I want the wall and know that Congress is to blame. But he also promised not to take away our #2A rights which includes bump stocks. So I'll blame him for that

This year with 1MMT carry-in and a 19 to 19.5MMT crop they should be able to do better.
2629 2018-12-19 14:35:10 With the amount of noise on social media regards stocks to buy etc it's interesting to see where the original ideas are coming from - are people relying on others for their ideas or doing their own screening.
2630 2018-12-19 14:34:56 If Maxine Waters is in charge of finance, no wonder stocks are plummeting. Enough said.
2631 2018-12-19 14:34:47 My policy is law abiding citizens should at least have what the criminals have. I don't agree with banning stuff to appease the angry mob. Hopefully there's been discussion behind the scenes that bump stocks will not be manufactured so no one gets them.
2632 2018-12-19 14:34:43 make sure to ban bump stocks tho

2642 2018-12-19 14:32:26 There are several hundred thousand bump stocks in circulation.  Banning them doesn’t make them disappear.  The killers don’t obey laws.  Laws only affect the law abiding citizen.

2657 2018-12-19 14:29:17 Once this hits the news cycle, we can watch @IHOP stocks dramatically drop let alone their customer base.

2658 2018-12-19 14:28:53 I will buy your Bump Stocks, so don't throw em away
2659 2018-12-19 14:28:12 It’s been over a year since the Vegas shooting. 

Yesterday the government banned bump stocks. 

Yet, still no motive or closure on the case? Maybe 2019 @samtripoli
2660 2018-12-19 14:27:38 With the sell-off in Wall St., the best scenario is to buy cheaper stocks like upcoming small companies whose purpose is merely to improve its product and lure investors to buy and not to fear.

2662 2018-12-19 14:27:14 Nope, not without a stocks bloodbath.
2663 2018-12-19 14:27:03 I got the same answer from a staff when I asked. But apparently the stocks are continuously incoming so I'm still waiting 
2664 2018-12-19 14:27:03 $SPY the percentage of stocks above the 50dma is at 15 percent which means a short term bottom is very close, perhaps today or after a post-fed move lower

2666 2018-12-19 14:26:43 Well I wish you blessings and good luck on finding something. Some people have it worse, we both need to count our blessings. I think its due to having doing buy backs on stocks and good old fashioned greed.
2667 2018-12-19 14:26:25 Hi there :) the minimum trade size is based on exposure (leverage x invested amount). For stocks, it is $500.

Tried new cartridges & maintenance modes but still wont work and retailer no longer stocks them. can you help? Would be in warranty as less than 12months

2674 2018-12-19 14:24:53 Here’s where

... bump fire stocks...the NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations
2675 2018-12-19 14:24:37 stocks went up a lil after i tweeted about the economy.................influencer.......
2676 2018-12-19 14:24:11 Imagine if markets did what FREE MARKETS should do and just ignored the free market manipulating Central Bank?

People lose sight of how twisted this whole thing has become.

Will stocks go up or down?
What direction is our free market economy headed in?

It's all up to the Fed.
2677 2018-12-19 14:24:08 @sendems @SenateGOP Pass @SenFeinstein bill to ban bump stocks and it would be great if you could ban military assault rifles at the same time!
2678 2018-12-19 14:23:58 Does someone have a full list of all the products trumpers aren’t able to use anymore? It’s got to be getting long. The left boycotts and company’s do the right thing. trumpers boycott and stocks shoot up. It’s fun to watch how little buying power they have.
2679 2018-12-19 14:23:34 I think bump stocks are a waste of ammo. But, if I had one I damn sure wouldn’t give it up. Also quit thinking the libs/socialist can sick the us military on the American people. At least not right now. If that day comes DC will probably be the first thing dealt with.
2680 2018-12-19 14:23:27 Ok serious question, are bump stocks absolutely necessary? Coming from someone who wholeheartedly supports the second amendment, do you not want bump stocks specifically banned? Ya can’t really use them for hunting...
2681 2018-12-19 14:23:17 Bump stocks ban is not an assault on the Second Amendment you can still buy the gun
2682 2018-12-19 14:23:14 If the Trump admin bans bump stocks and then folds on the wall tomorrow,   will you still blindly support him or will you begin to see the cracks in his stories?
2683 2018-12-19 14:23:05 @NRA well looks like the DOJ just started changing the law on bump stocks when that is the job of Congress.
As a life member of the NRA I may think twice before I send you anymore money.
What is next, outlawing semiautomatic weapons?
NRA, you screwed up on this.
2684 2018-12-19 14:22:59 Everyone knows , or should know that Saudi interest own majority of Twitter and Facebook stocks. Muslim controlled!
2685 2018-12-19 14:22:38 They don't want to leave - then they do then they don't - they merely gear their pronouncements for two things

1) Momentary advantage
2) Maximum damage

They are not fit to occupy any positions in public life outside of a gibbet or stocks
2686 2018-12-19 14:22:22 Bulgaria currently has one of the largest stocks of Bitcoin in the world. An investigation organized by Bulgarian law enforcement in May 2017 resulted in the seizure of 213,519 Bitcoins, enough to pay a quarter of the country's national debt. #Bulgaria #BTC Wahhhh 1/4
2687 2018-12-19 14:22:16 Bump stocks are virtually worthless for serious shooters but any move in this direction is huge for the anti gun nuts. This is a big deal. Obama couldn't have done this.

2691 2018-12-19 14:20:29 We need a website that can check stocks for an item you want both online and locally without having to check individual websites.

2695 2018-12-19 14:18:49 Macro: Global economies continue to erode. Analysts/economists see slower US Econ growth 2019. Record liquidations at hedge funds a headwind for stocks and commodities. Crude oil still within a bear market. #economy
2696 2018-12-19 14:18:49 I don’t use guns, I don’t believe in them. And what’s wrong with banning bump stocks? Even trump sees how dangerous they are
2697 2018-12-19 14:18:45 To me bump stocks are a gimmicky toy... But I find it concerning that the ATF along with POTUS made private property illegal so quickly without due process. Additionally this opens up the door to more regulation. #2A #BumpStocks
2698 2018-12-19 14:18:22 No it doesn’t. It is solely to ban on bump stocks. It’s very clear. And yes a dem President would do that but Trump won’t. So we just need to make sure TRUMP WINS 2020

2702 2018-12-19 14:17:31 "Bump Stocks"
1. A Miami night club
2. Term used to describe one's sexual value
2703 2018-12-19 14:17:06 $GDX ended up doing big volume yesterday over 79 million shares.  Volume is on pace to hit 350 million shares this week but today's FOMC decision should have a dramatic impact on breakout potential.  More individual gold stocks are taking volume $WPM #goldstocks #gold

Loophole that allows lawmakers to buy indvl stocks must be closed

2707 2018-12-19 14:16:17 2/ like stocks end up--at least historically--doing the best. Think of it in terms of owning an IOU versus a piece of an actual business that grows over time. There's a parable about a king and three servants that illustrates this. 
Spoiler alert: the servant who buried the
2708 2018-12-19 14:15:55 I think it's a personal thing found through trial and error. I used to trade stocks and i felt they didn't move fast enough. Then I found crypto and it's a more dynamic and volatile market that seems to suit better with my personality.
2709 2018-12-19 14:15:54 .@rushlimbaugh @TuckerCarlson I do not oppose the ban on bump stocks but I do oppose the govt forcing people with LEGALLY purchased items to suffer an economic loss. Why aren't they "buying back" bump stocks?  Isn't this unconstitutional seizure of personal property? @NRA
2710 2018-12-19 14:15:41 These 4 Stocks Could Gain Big Time From Falling Oil Prices
2711 2018-12-19 14:15:38 He took their bump stocks away, too. 
2712 2018-12-19 14:15:31 TODAY is a key day for stocks when Federal Reserve announces their  decision on interest rate increases...stock market is anticipating they  will be Nice...if they are Naughty, stocks will get spanked
2713 2018-12-19 14:15:28 And these same assholes won’t come clean about what happened in Vegas. Sickening all the way up to Trump. That’s a bigger issue than bump stocks.
2714 2018-12-19 14:15:02 Bump stocks surprised me.
2715 2018-12-19 14:15:01 Bump stocks much?
2716 2018-12-19 14:14:52 Yeah! Cut the programs that help people that need it! Give money to the rich! Give more money to companies so they can buy back their own stocks! Build more war machines that the military itself doesn't want! Build more nukes! Build a giant useless wall!
2717 2018-12-19 14:14:36 Loved going F1 stocks, but got too expensive for regular monthly trips. Then Coventry was destroyed by developers trying to override the land usage so they can build houses :/

You may well lost my support for 2020 and those who support the 2 Amendment.
The DOJ cannot make law, only Congress can. The DOJ cannot change the law on bump stocks for semiautomatic rifles, only Congress can make law.

2725 2018-12-19 14:13:00 Morning Market Update: stocks rise ahead of Fed rate decision
2726 2018-12-19 14:12:46 I'm a virgo. What stocks are right for me?
2727 2018-12-19 14:11:55 Story is on arrests rather than prisoners - so 'flows' not 'stocks' - but same basic point.  Also, how many people are in jail for federal "crimes" like possession now legal in the state the jail is in? Would put some serious $$ on that disparity looking very biased by race, too.
2728 2018-12-19 14:11:14 #KnowYourRights, #2A opens with a warning to the government "appease the people" or "they will overthrow you" for the reason of "the peoples rights to have weapons, no matter what they are, shall not be infringed" @realDonaldTrump's move to ban bump stocks is #Unconstitutional
2729 2018-12-19 14:11:04 They should list all congressional members in the house and senate who have bought and traded stocks and voted to favor those companies in which the hold stocks including the banks too
2730 2018-12-19 14:10:58 Greater than ever, like bump stocks , but out of crimals and law abiding Americans ! Only outlaws will have them;(
Getting things done for Americans! Should let Muslims in America unless vetted and Christian!
2731 2018-12-19 14:10:46 Although we'd love to give everyone a VIP slot, we can't guarantee who will be offered one. If our criteria is met, our selection process is at random due to limited stocks and slot availability. 

Hope this helps.
2732 2018-12-19 14:10:12 And yet so many puts were bought yesterday and the DSI for stocks hit 8 this week. But "pretty much everyone" is focused on buying a rip?
2733 2018-12-19 14:10:03 Trump administration is banning bump stocks? Hahaha 
2734 2018-12-19 14:09:23 Stocks are going down ... You cannot afford to say - I'm busy right now! - When you loose millions ... Amazon have specific culture (believe my I know) and we do not leave important things for later.
2735 2018-12-19 14:08:38 Many ordinary people are invested in stocks anyway, as well as retirement funds. It does kind of trickle down in that sense to ordinary pensioners.
2736 2018-12-19 14:08:29 The coffee shop thing bothers me, only bc 88% of the time it’s someone talking at 120 db about something like how their stocks are doing, how they came up with their business idea or their adoration of foreign film.

Shut it!! Just drink your caffeine.
2737 2018-12-19 14:08:18 Banning bump stocks isn’t going to stop criminals. People on YouTube can create a bump stock with a piece of a broom handle. We need to look into better mental health programs.
2738 2018-12-19 14:08:14 $tsla $twtr breakout failures . Maybe it’s the bear market or maybe it’s the stocks themselves
2739 2018-12-19 14:08:11 While I am personally not a fan of bump stocks and would not choose to own one, bsnning them kicks the door wide open four arguments in favor of banning all autoloading guns. And don't think for a moment the left hasn't already thought of using that argument.
2740 2018-12-19 14:07:30 With the criminal reform past we'll be needing those bump stocks!
2741 2018-12-19 14:07:27 chart chaser are still very active in other stocks/indexes and likely to be obliterated in the same manner as commodities.
2742 2018-12-19 14:07:26 @CNN where's the news about Trump banning bumper stocks? I hate Trump but you're serious hypocrites if you go on about freedom of the press and 'fake news' being fake when you clearly post selectively about Trump.
2743 2018-12-19 14:07:10 Hi Jamie, thanks for getting in touch. I can see Southampton Extra, SO31 8GN stocks these items. Kind regards - Mark
2744 2018-12-19 14:06:36 $HMY gold stocks still on fire
2745 2018-12-19 14:06:16 The Trump administration just banned bump stocks for guns. One of the very few times I will give Donald Trump credit of doing something right.
2746 2018-12-19 14:06:15 Great news! All drug lords, gang members, and wackjobs just signed a pledge to hand in their bump stocks to law enforcement.
2747 2018-12-19 14:06:11 bull markets u want to trade more stocks... bear mkts you want to trade more ETF's.
2748 2018-12-19 14:05:50 Don't need bump stocks. There's several other ways to make it work just as good.

Thumb and belt loop is one way.
Unless they ban thumbs and belt loops.
2749 2018-12-19 14:05:18 i sure hope that this report comes out with more than just banning bump stocks. 

 @cspanwj
2750 2018-12-19 14:05:17 J'ai une approche mitigée au fait qu' @EcoTree_contact ait des arbres qui ne soient plus en stock. D'un côté, ça veut dire qu'il y a pleiiiin de gens qui en ont achetés, de l'autre ça veut dire qu'ils ont pas assez de stocks. BUY ALL THE TREES !
2751 2018-12-19 14:04:55 Both bump stocks and fully automatic firearms should be fully legal and unrestricted.
2752 2018-12-19 14:04:53 Oh puleeeze. I am a progressive and I like this just fine along with the banning of bump stocks/ said as much in social media. For the first time in two years this admin has passed sensible legislation- slow clap. It doesn’t not make them criminals though.
2753 2018-12-19 14:04:50 #PresidentTrump has banned bump stocks. Wow! One in a row.
2754 2018-12-19 14:04:38 So far this week, Trump has overseen a ban on bump stocks, prison reform & the creation of a space corps. 
Media talks about Cohen, Flynn & Russian collusion.
See the problem?
2755 2018-12-19 14:04:28 So Trump bans bump stocks which makes mass shootings way less easy and everyone a just gonna sit back and not give him praise bc he's Trump

2758 2018-12-19 14:03:21 I can’t believe I agree w/ Joe - kinda - that many CEOs think their co stocks are undervalued. Jimmy trashes cos doing buyback when their stocks are down. A classic case of price drives sentiment

The thing w/ buyback, a strong BoD should be the chk & bal against CEO’s impulse
2759 2018-12-19 14:03:14 Bump Stock's don't kill People, Ban the GUNS you just can't seem to understand the regular Person does not need to have these guns in their possession. The Guns kill people , not bump stocks.
2760 2018-12-19 14:03:01 OK GREAT! NOW REVERSE THE BAN ON BUMP STOCKS AND SLAP DOWN THE BAN ON HIGH CAP MAGAZINES IN NJ AND CA.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO RIGHT TO DISARM OR HAMPER THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS OF ITS CITIZENS!
2761 2018-12-19 14:02:51 No, its not matter of opinion.
I've told you what it says, & I don't care what you think, you are wrong. If you are right, then every airline would go out of business, & stocks in them would collapse. Neither of these have happened. you are spouting fake news.

2763 2018-12-19 14:02:36 Trump doesn't work in terms of "right & wrong" morally or ethically. His yardstick is "popularity". That's how we got the new prison reform bill, bump stocks banned & reversal on his wall. I expect no govt shutdown & a new trade deal with China because he can't take the heat now.
2764 2018-12-19 14:02:20 May ver.2 na ng Winner LS, and yes I'm anticipating for this..kaya wala stocks sa YG..

2767 2018-12-19 14:01:42 Do you ever short stocks?
2768 2018-12-19 14:01:40 @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks first. What is next. Our guns? Our ammo? Looks at Nicaragua ? Are we now headed for that scene?
2769 2018-12-19 14:01:37 Robert you are on five stocks
2770 2018-12-19 14:01:21 Calm down. @potus should not be banning bump stocks. If he does he is doing what the Democrats want.

Do not miss out.
While stocks last.
2780 2018-12-19 13:59:59 It's about a "Lot" more than bump stocks.

Previous rule one trigger pull fires more than one round aka select fire automatic.

Expanded rule changes to a "rate of fire" restriction.

What could possibly go wrong here?

Almost any semi auto can be bump fired without a bump stock.
2781 2018-12-19 13:59:40 Silly talk.  Even if you’re in favor of gun control, you should be horrified this new law was a dictate. Plus, when I turn on the news and see all of the shootings in New Orleans or Chicago, literally none of them use bump stocks.
2782 2018-12-19 13:59:27 I don’t give a flying one if he called her a batshit crazy loon.... the country is going to hell and this is what you think of as news. Pathetic! May, Corbyn and the BBC are laughing stocks now, and dragging the rest of us with the crazy mofo’s.
2783 2018-12-19 13:58:52 @realDonaldTrump 
By banning bump stocks you just gave more power to the government. Way to go socialist. Im disappointed in you and I voted for you. Strike 2 after the omnibus bill.

The owner’s pretty good at knowing that’s popular, so the lack of merch makes me wonder if BF is considered niche or something.

2796 2018-12-19 13:57:00 @realDonaldTrump 
All you did was demonize a piece of property instead of placing the blame where it belongs. Banning any part of a weapon is unconstitutional and you will lose votes as well as you will face a fight in court. Bump stocks are not the problem.
2797 2018-12-19 13:56:53 Criminal justice reform, banning of bump stocks - win after win after win, Trumps pile of successes makes Obama’s 8 years look like nothing more than house sitting. Imagine if he did not have the Dems, rhinos, media, deep state, Soros and Paul Ryan blocking him + Activist judges?
2798 2018-12-19 13:56:48 No fan of bump stocks, but seen several vids of people using rubber bands and clothing to produce same effect.  So, why waste money on bump stocks.

 Step 1.  Next!
2802 2018-12-19 13:53:41 I refuse to like this post. It starts one step at a time and yesterday was the first step [with the ban of bump-stocks] Now if everyone doesn't turn theirs in, the law will be coming after them. Get the picture!!
2803 2018-12-19 13:53:17 No he didn’t & if you think banning bump stocks will do anything, you obviously don’t know anything about firearms &/or are delusional.
2804 2018-12-19 13:53:14 would that imply buying of stocks or could go either way?

2811 2018-12-19 13:49:41 So many good stocks to buy - NVDA BAC TOL SMAR FDC TCBI or just keep buying SPY in 245-255 range. Time to sell stocks that don’t make the top ten list.

You are arguing machine guns and all other weapons should legal even without a licence.

2816 2018-12-19 13:47:55 The point is not that bump stocks are useless and inaccurate anyways so who cares? The point is that infringement on our rights keeps getting chipped away. What right does our government have to tell me what I can and cannot own when it comes to guns!? This is unforgivable.

2824 2018-12-19 13:45:47 I really wish the media would do a better job of examining the details of the economic growth we've had over the past ten years. How much of the gains go to the top 0.1%? What % of Americans own over $10,000 in stocks/bonds/mutual funds? What % of US equities are foreign-held?
2825 2018-12-19 13:45:24 So, two years of Trump and a Republican controlled Congress and No "Obamacare repeal", No wall but we did get an arbitrary ban on bump stocks that will turn as many as 1,000,000 law-abiding, tax payers into FELONS in 90 days. I'm really tired of winning.

2829 2018-12-19 13:44:17 people won't be turning the stocks in. Regardless of how people feel about the devices, the gov. has no right to take away ownership of the stocks.
2830 2018-12-19 13:44:16 I'm sorry, with practice, a bump stocks does allow someone to use a semi automatic assault rifle as a fully automatic. It is all about finger placement and trigger control.

2831 2018-12-19 13:44:13 NBFC  stocks like Shriram Transport Finance surged 6% to close at Rs1275.  Others like Bajaj Finance, L&T Finance, India Bull Housing Finance  (up 7%), Dewan Housing gained 2-7%.

2906 2018-12-19 13:20:04 Every time they mention the fear of their stocks falling and Social Security being cut, I will remind them that I don’t live in TN and didn’t vote for Blackburn or Trump...they did. That is how they raised me...reminding me of all I did/do wrong...my turn 
2907 2018-12-19 13:19:46 Yeah here and there... I really watch stocks though like Apple, Nike, NASDAQ and Dow Jones... that's where the money at around this time...
2908 2018-12-19 13:19:46 @TheRealRaNon The only time Bump stocks would be useful is when there are crowds attacking you! We all know that protesters never get violent and attack people in mass! Oh, wait, the Rodney King riots?

Now I have extra money for stocks and business stuff
2912 2018-12-19 13:17:50 Don't own a bump stock. Don't want one. But banning bump stocks with no grandfather clause for existing owners is dumb. It's also the legislature's job - not the president's.

2915 2018-12-19 13:17:04 Ah yes... I was uncomfortable putting a name to what us such a standard forced short play for so many stocks - especially after the aforementioned was said to be a possible good guy.

2919 2018-12-19 13:16:11 I’m glad @realDonaldTrump banned bump-stocks... still, we need to unite in 2020 and ban all Trump-stock.
2920 2018-12-19 13:16:04 The old people are off to @DSCasinoResort.  It will be more fun than watching the stocks go down and losing our savings.

2923 2018-12-19 13:15:42 Back to bump stocks, as i said this has nothing to do with 2A makes world a smidgen safer, at 0 harm to gun owners.. Although I do have a problem with the bumpstocks being taken without just compensation.. The 5th Amendment clearly states that as illegal..
2924 2018-12-19 13:15:37 no just holding the stuff i have mate, not a penny more though. 5 stocks all under water around £80k worth right now. thats a couple of buy to lets just there

2926 2018-12-19 13:15:17 You need to read the actual statute, because you're wrong.  It explicitly points out that there are no bump stocks that meet the requirements for legally keeping them.
2927 2018-12-19 13:15:16 I thought banning bump stocks was some sort of financial reform until yesterday!
2928 2018-12-19 13:15:14 Thought for the day: its important to remember that what some businessmen might call "ruthless pragmatism," you can just read as "stupid ignorance in the long term." After all, the same people who hold stocks in these companies probably won't agree w these ruthless business plans

2935 2018-12-19 13:13:46 Regarding yesterday's excitement on the banning of bump stocks, a little reality check today.  This was nothing more than a rule implemented by the Trump administration and can be rescinded at any time.  We see Presidents implement and rescind rules all of the time.
2936 2018-12-19 13:13:46 You can only keep ones manufactured before a certain date, and bump stocks didn't exist before that date.  It explicitly points this out.
2937 2018-12-19 13:13:38 I’m not sure how feel about banishment of bump stocks.

2938 2018-12-19 13:13:11 LOL - bump stocks betrayal
2939 2018-12-19 13:12:46 while you were distracted wtih flynn, trump just banned bump stocks and attacked our 2nd amendment, but yet i didnt hear one freaking word out of you against it
2940 2018-12-19 13:12:28 Is it possible that the market decline is caused by China’s government forcing the country’s investors to sell US stocks, or to short?  They have so much cash, and that would be a nasty way to punish us.
2941 2018-12-19 13:12:26 Honda stocks show a decline after promoting their "proud" inclusion in latino cultural events.

2944 2018-12-19 13:11:45 Respectfully disagree- there is absolutely no need for bump stocks! As Justice Scalia said we don’t have unfettered rights under the 2nd!
2945 2018-12-19 13:10:52 I think we forget that President Trump spent his life as a DEMOCRAT before running for @POTUS and in many way's he is Still a DEMOCRAT. 

(i.e. Bump Stocks, Womens rights, Foreign Aid$) 

Cut him some slack, Dem's, he's always been one of you, maybe you should follow example.
2946 2018-12-19 13:10:50 Thoughts and prayers for those with bump stocks.
2947 2018-12-19 13:10:45 The Trump administration finally doing something morally right? The ban of Bump Stocks!

2955 2018-12-19 13:08:17 Ken Langone on CNBC - buy good stocks, put them away, stop looking at the market. Sounds like a plan 
2956 2018-12-19 13:08:14 You know your Presidency is in trouble when you gotta square up to the NRA and ban bump stocks
2957 2018-12-19 13:07:58 So much misunderstanding. This isn't about bump stocks.
2958 2018-12-19 13:07:58 I think what we can ascribe a high probability to is the market reaction to indication of a 2019 pause. Dollar pushes down, stocks go up, credit spreads compress, implied vols pare down.
2959 2018-12-19 13:07:27 Seriously you’re blaming democrats when the republicans also said no? You do realize you (right now) have the majority in both. You certainly know how to piss our money away. How’s the stocks, deficit doing. You’re bankrupting the country like your businesses. 38% approval.

2962 2018-12-19 13:06:59 why should we? Trump said mexico is paying for it, now you expect us to pay? he said he will protect our 2nd amendment rights, then while you were distracted with Flynn, he is banning bump stocks!? a piece of plastic, that is NOT a machine gun like they say. keep your word!
2963 2018-12-19 13:06:35 Current Outlook: MARKET IN CORRECTION (Day 2) @IBDinvestors #stocks
2964 2018-12-19 13:06:17 Bump stocks are not an "enumerated constitutional right".
2965 2018-12-19 13:05:44 Try again , the banning of bump stocks has been pushed by Senator Feinstein long before Kushner was even in DC
2966 2018-12-19 13:05:06 Check your facts. Bump stocks were approved during the Obama administration.  He never tried to outlaw them.
2967 2018-12-19 13:05:02 Because until Las Vegas, no one had used them in a mass shooting. Bump stocks are not considered firearms; they are classified by ATF as firearm part, and ATF doesn't have jurisdiction over firearm parts, so no one thought there was a need to ban them.
2968 2018-12-19 13:05:00 What about outdoor concerts, restaurants, bars, shopping malls, grocery stores and on and on!

We need tough gun control laws NOW. Making “bump stocks” illegal is a good first step. Let us now ban high velocity ammunition!

2969 2018-12-19 13:04:55 Here are my bagger stocks for 2019– #ALM #AVCT #ARS.    What are your 3?
2970 2018-12-19 13:04:10 @realDonaldTrump I am very disappointed in you, not only for banning bump fire stocks but for not getting anything in return for gun owners (like national reciprocity or removal of suppressors from NFA). You have lost my support and the support of many gun owners.
2971 2018-12-19 13:03:21 You think folks are lining up to turn in their unregistered bump stocks 
2972 2018-12-19 13:03:20 Many people including myself already assumed bump-stocks belong under the full auto ban (which i know is arguably unconstitutional itself).

With no political will and state/local govts outright banning semi-auto rifles, fighting this would have been a huge waste of resources.
2973 2018-12-19 13:02:51 why are my stocks going down president trump can you fix that please thank you
2974 2018-12-19 13:02:40 Is it possible that the market decline is caused by China’s government forcing the country’s investors to sell US stocks, or to short?  They have so much cash, and that would be a nasty way to punish us.
2975 2018-12-19 13:02:18 First bump stocks, next semi automatic  weapons. I trust the NRA will take this up through and to the SCOTUS.
2976 2018-12-19 13:01:56 at 46, oil is 360 degrees down from last swing high with 46 aligning with December 21st for a time/price square-out based on my Square of 9 Wheel.

2977 2018-12-19 13:01:49 You can't buy stocks with orders written on toilet paper inked in your feces.
2978 2018-12-19 13:01:42 I am definitely keeping all of my bump stocks.
2979 2018-12-19 13:01:38 Here's a headline stocks have never been this high in December ev
2980 2018-12-19 13:01:07 Trump moves to ban bump stocks on your rifles. I have no choice but to no longer support Trump.
2981 2018-12-19 13:01:00 Bump stocks are not guns. Nothing unconstitutional about banning them.

2983 2018-12-19 13:00:35 Hold him accountable for what ? 3% Gdp, lowest unemployment, better and fairer trade deals, better relations with North Korea, fewer regulations, less taxes, prison reform, banning bump-stocks ?
2984 2018-12-19 12:59:47 As an investor (stop laughing) I want to hear about the "death of equities" and how no one wants to own stocks.  I heard about such a time in the 1970s but I was just a child.  I assume we would have to enter a similar high inflation environment for that to ever return?
2985 2018-12-19 12:59:44 It's just silly because the vast majority of gun owners don't own bump stocks and don't want bump stocks.
2986 2018-12-19 12:59:43 It really had far more to do with eugenics.  Reformers felt an urgency to separate the “fit” from the “unfit”. To promote high birth rates among better stocks & eliminate the lowly stocks from the gene pool.
2987 2018-12-19 12:58:41 So don’t listen!
2988 2018-12-19 12:58:12 We managed to snag some at the Marlborough Safeway but stocks were running low!! Maybe check there
2989 2018-12-19 12:58:10 So to recap the stupid, heartless sh*t you’ve said since your reelection in November. 

-food is not a right, but bump stocks are.
-disaster relief to help fellow Americans is less important than a wall ONLY costing 5 billion

2992 2018-12-19 12:55:52 There is no law protecting bump stocks.

The gun companies should compensate the buyers if they care about them so much.

Or since you've always maintained the NRA was pro-gun buyers... THEY should help compensate their members.

You know, because...they care.  Right?
2993 2018-12-19 12:55:50 .
Re: Banning Bump Stocks

Ain't heard a word about compensation for the gummint's 'taking'...

At least Australia pd reasonable comps for the firearms they confiscated...

Anybody seen anything on this...

2995 2018-12-19 12:55:02 @amandacarpenter way more tweets yesterday from you about Michael Flynn than bump stocks banned/historic CJR bill passing senate (bi-partisan!!!) Totally get you have to cover both, but it’s prime example on what’s wrong with media today and why the news fatigue is real.
2996 2018-12-19 12:55:01 ...states a San Francisco leftist. You are #projecting. 
And FYI, they are redefining the word "machine guns" to potentially include semiautomatic weapons just to try to ban bump stocks.

2999 2018-12-19 12:54:12 @jonesca100 now the bump stocks!
3000 2018-12-19 12:54:01 The banning of bump stocks,  whether effective or not,  thought out or as a stunt,  is a gutsy move. A stupid one but gutsy nevertheless
3001 2018-12-19 12:53:43 I'm just stating that I don't have a problem with them taking bump stocks. Just like if it were a stupid selfie stick. No reason for either of them and I can even think of better uses for a selfie stick. No reason to cause a fuss.
3002 2018-12-19 12:53:39 Oh, I’m with you here. But bump stocks are a pain to aim. Semi is so much more effective in a wartime scenario. They were really just a fun way to burn a shit ton of money lol
3003 2018-12-19 12:53:17 Gotta pick n choose battles.  Trumps bump stock ban is no big deal.  Truthfully those stocks are a novelty/gimmicky anyways.  I still doubt one was used in Vegas shooting.  It's guns I care about, not BS like bump stocks.  Carry on folks.  Fight fights that matter.
3004 2018-12-19 12:52:56 @cspanwj Banning bump stocks is a good thing, but how will the gov't know if everyone complies and turns them in or destroys them?
3005 2018-12-19 12:52:45 Wow, well done. This is the first I’ve heard of it. Between Flynn, Penny Marshall and a vague post about bump stocks, criminal just reform sadly didn’t make a blip.
3006 2018-12-19 12:52:08 Wood stocks are great. And with a rifle, you can have distance as an ally. Sure it's louder. But you're far away.

And it's better against people.

3011 2018-12-19 12:51:00 President trump. Why did you ban bump stocks . Now millions csnt own one just because one nut case used it ,he was a democrat 
Why don't you ban vehicles too. They kill more people
3012 2018-12-19 12:50:55 Ideally I'd like to see the Cabinet marched through the streets before a stint in the stocks before Christmas.
3013 2018-12-19 12:50:30 CBS Morning News on anything they think Trump does bad always has a  negative comment our editorial. But when he does something good like banning bump stocks & prison reform they just reported with no positive comment# CBS Morning News
3014 2018-12-19 12:49:56 To everyone who thinks trump and republicans are starting to change because of  bump stocks being banned or new sentencing guidelines. Don’t believe them. They are worried about losing the senate. Vote them out. Stand together and vote blue
3015 2018-12-19 12:49:07 You know, I’m actually fine with the Trump administration’s ban on bump stocks. They have no real application in a real firefight and were only good for pumping out large amounts of rounds in a general direction.
3016 2018-12-19 12:48:55 #Stocks: Los futuros de las acciones de U.S apuntan a una apertura al alza pues los indicios de avance en la disputa comercial entre U.S. y China han elevado la confianza, mientras los inversores esperan impacientes la última decisión de política monetaria de la #Fed.

3018 2018-12-19 12:47:57 Well by defenition of the ATF  any device to bump fire is a machine gun, such as jeens belt loops. The stupidest idea for the atf to define bump stocks as such then for the goverment to take property with out compensation

3029 2018-12-19 12:45:02 The only time Trump talked abt taking guns was from idiots like this & yes he wants to ban bump stocks bc no one needs them. This guy is not an example of a Trump supporter. This guy needs to be in jail. He’s arrogant. Im sure he cussed the @SecretService #Threat #Idiot

3034 2018-12-19 12:43:57 They want you to turn in your bump stocks? Tell them to come and take them. You paid for them fair and square. It's YOUR property, not theirs. #Guns #Molonlabe #2A #SecondAmendment

3036 2018-12-19 12:43:33 From your initial tweet it appeared that you already had a position on. No problem. What security do you trade for Natural Gas exposure? Is it Futures, stocks or etf's or options etc?
3037 2018-12-19 12:43:12 @FedEx sets buyouts as unit struggles The buyouts program should result in a $450 million to $575 million pre-tax charge in the quarter ending May 31. Stocks had fallen about 26% so far this year and plunged 5% to $175.49 in after-hours trading
3038 2018-12-19 12:42:49 I couldn't care less about bump stocks.  But any bans I feel are just testing the water.  "Ok that went smooth, let's see what we can ban next" mentality
3039 2018-12-19 12:42:06 HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED WITH BUMP STOCKS?
3040 2018-12-19 12:41:37 XRP is NOT a stock 

XRP will NOT rise like stocks 

This money is not mine to gamble and I don't gamble 

If you have hole in your pocket plenty of charities than could do with donations especially this time of year 
3041 2018-12-19 12:41:36 I would like to say that I have no idea what happens today. I am long oil and short stocks and expect to lose money on at least one of these
3042 2018-12-19 12:41:35 Only an idiot trump follower would be in favor of bump stocks.
3043 2018-12-19 12:40:58 Trump is taking away bump stocks, that's also violating 2nd amendment rights
3044 2018-12-19 12:40:57 Investment mistakes
- Buying infra stocks at start of 2018 (going by advice of a reputed analyst)
- Holding on to Rain by going against advice from a close friend 
Investment lessons:
- Bear market gives a wonderful opportunity to build huge positions in good stocks #Investing
3045 2018-12-19 12:39:46 And there it is, the classic slippery slope line. Not sure how you would classify banning bump stocks as dangerous but I guess if I felt the need to have one I guess I’d be paranoid and think everything is dangerous. You’re right...don’t change a thing. Just keep sending prayers
3046 2018-12-19 12:38:21 I'm a big 2A guy myself.  And gun owner/collector.  I see bump stocks as a gimmick.  I looked into buying one years ago when they first came out.  I deemed them kinda silly.
3047 2018-12-19 12:38:15 Perhaps they apply the classic definition of a 20% drop since the peak prices? In that sense many stocks even the FAANGs are in a bear market. It’s a definition with some problems
3048 2018-12-19 12:37:49 Bump stocks are silly, buy a better trigger.

3051 2018-12-19 12:37:08 IHOP now stands for “I Hate Our President”, so not only will I not dine there, I am directing my investment portfolio manager(s) to dump theirs and all stocks of those other 15 companies.
3052 2018-12-19 12:37:08 @POTUS two positive things yesterday. Senate passing criminal justice reform and the banning of bump stocks.  See, this is progress. Good Job.
3053 2018-12-19 12:37:07 I'm old enough to remember the end of oct early November when you were supposed to buy stocks because the economy is fine

You don't hear that anymore, another 10% straight down and it's recession talk for the "never rights"
3054 2018-12-19 12:37:05 Don’t know, don’t care. My old man used to tell me before he left this shitty world, never chase stocks, women, or buses.  You’ll always get left behind. Lol
3055 2018-12-19 12:36:00 @GalvinSeriously you dumb shit,bump stocks don’t make anything a machine gun.
3056 2018-12-19 12:35:48 Hope you have a big house in case stocks go really south!
3057 2018-12-19 12:35:19 Every white boy crying about bump stocks looks like he has a wall full of holes for every time a girl won't give him head.
3058 2018-12-19 12:35:01 Dear #kremlintrolls, #PutinBots and #altwankers, we've got a Christmas special on hat-grade tinfoil today. Hurry while stocks last!
3059 2018-12-19 12:34:57 Bump stocks are a wood or plastic connected to springs or elastic bands.
They are stupid, the shake weight of the gun accessory world
3060 2018-12-19 12:34:39 royal Taylor Alesias new perfume, go buy it as soon it stocks up!!
3061 2018-12-19 12:34:20 Bump stocks are dangerous toys. Guns are serious tools for adults. Just tie a bungee cord around the stock and trigger and swing it around your head if you’re bored.
3062 2018-12-19 12:33:29 You are rite sr.
3063 2018-12-19 12:33:22 @FaresAlHaqbani @moom1 @RKBQ8 @LordSnackington So is the combo game in SSBU as incredibly brutal as all these highlight reels I’m seeing suggests? Stocks look to be hella fragile.
3064 2018-12-19 12:33:09 “Just as it takes more time and energy to push a boulder up a hill than fall, so it is with stocks.  Both gravity and fear bring things down in a hurry.” Stan Weinstein
3065 2018-12-19 12:32:56 For stocks to continue their recent slide because of Fed policy, FOMC has to raise rates today AND issue a pretty hawkish statement. Unlikely outcome but not impossible. $SPX $TNX
3066 2018-12-19 12:32:47 As much as I despise Tump, he deserves credit fo this reform, and the ban on bump stocks
3067 2018-12-19 12:32:04 As per wit and wisdom of @pboockvar "Only 17% of NYSE stocks are trading above their 200 day moving average with many in a bear market and all we get is 21.4% of those surveyed being bearish?" Must be nice to live in that zip code...
3068 2018-12-19 12:32:02 @asxmugpunter fucking adapt dinosaurs, every single day stocks are pumping along kids.
Excuses+ for the lemmings
3069 2018-12-19 12:31:57 This is a nonsense policy.   Bump stocks by gun definitions cannot be automatic weapons.  This move loses trump the election.  I’m staying home.
3070 2018-12-19 12:31:55 As stocks move to new lows, it's an all-time record year for U.S. corporate stock buybacks.

About $800B of stock has already been bought back amid total announcements of $1.1T.

The trend is likely to continue into 2019.

3074 2018-12-19 12:30:17 Never thought the day would come, but we do need to give a *little* credit to Trump. Criminal justice reform passes and bump stocks are now banned. Guess it was time for a little good to come out of the White House.
3075 2018-12-19 12:29:44 @MorningBriefing Please - as you are covering bump stocks and Betsy Devos - that you also cover that the department of education has rolled back the policy on racial equality in schools as far as discipline goes

3080 2018-12-19 12:27:27 Trump and Q said our 1A and 2A are safe. Both lied. Our 1A is being stomped every single day on social media and out on the street. Our 2A is being slowly stripped away first with bump stocks & now the number of bullets in a clip. Nothing is safe. They are all working against us.

I trust the management in all 3 & prospects look positive over the next few months even if times get tougher

I also expect a bounce in cryptos in due course as well
3085 2018-12-19 12:25:44 Y’all remember when Obama tried to ban bump stocks? Whenever a Democratic leader tries to do something the Republicans never pass it, but if a Republican leader suggests the SAME DAMN THING oh shit now the Republicans are on board.
3086 2018-12-19 12:25:20 Spot on.
I was in investment committee discussion recently with an Irish fund & people were terrified that 2008 could happen again. I pointed out to them that in 2008 I was 26 years old and almost all of my friends owned more than two houses. Some of them secured against stocks!
3087 2018-12-19 12:25:13 @POTUS  why sign EO banning bump stocks????? Pandora’s Box is now open. Even Obama didn’t sign EO’s on gun control
3088 2018-12-19 12:24:38 Trump supporters have a different moral code. You cannot support a known liar, an admitted molester, a spiteful heart unless those characteristics are consistent with your own core beliefs and behavior.
3089 2018-12-19 12:24:05 How the hell are bump stocks just becoming illegal now. Something needs to change so that something like that can move much faster. What was that? Like a year and a half? To long. #GunControlNow

3092 2018-12-19 12:23:11 @business #DaybreakAmericas @DavidWestin @lisaabramowicz1 : Tell #BenLaidler & #CathieWoods that what's supporting stocks in The USA is really stock buybacks. That's what's negating the impact of monetary policy on the stock market. It was in fact an X factor( not factored)
3093 2018-12-19 12:22:45 Bull is just liquidity backed.
I don’t know anyone in my contact who wants to put money, they are just waiting for sell off as most of the stocks are trading at loss to them. This period is very similar to crypto, everyone wanted it to go up, but no one was putting. Crash severe
3094 2018-12-19 12:22:31 Nice that you support the ban on bump stocks. When are you going to actually start fighting for the Second Amendment? The NRA has now become the Sierra Club.
3095 2018-12-19 12:22:24 Is Nigeria more CORRUPT financially than US henge funds  EQUITY traders?

3099 2018-12-19 12:21:10 First of all, guns with bump stocks are effectively full-auto, so I definitely want them banned. But it's funny that a far-right administration not only didn't repel Clinton ban, they also took more toys away from "well regulated militia"
3100 2018-12-19 12:20:36 Chain 2 bump stocks together like nun chucks a federal court said nun chucks are protected under the 2nd amendment
3101 2018-12-19 12:20:20 @jjlkfi @billhandelshow, Trump didn’t have any right to ban bump stocks, the next president will take advantage of that, it’s okay to sell weapons to the Middle East, though, there’s already a better option than bump stocks, anyway. Go technology, the Emperor is NAKED! Morning
3102 2018-12-19 12:20:12 Good points! What about buying more of now cheaply valued stocks with good fundamentals to reduce average cost? What do you mean by 'go short term on bad stock'? Do you mean going 'short'? Is that possible in N G?
3103 2018-12-19 12:19:37 I missed the days when I monitored stocks everyday (except weekends & public holidays). Headache-inducing but it's exciting.
3104 2018-12-19 12:19:36 Fergus Lamentable asks us to point out that the special offer on Glen Feckoff whisky is only available as long as stocks last.
3105 2018-12-19 12:19:08 If the current crop of Brexiteer ministers think Brexit is a doubling down of Neo-Liberalism we may as well pre-order our yellow jackets now before stocks run out.
3106 2018-12-19 12:18:56 You’re probably right, not another “great depression“. However, a few months off the high in 1929, there were stocks that were trading near their highs. Same goes for 1973 and 2007, both periods that began bear markets in which the stock market lost over 50% of its value
3107 2018-12-19 12:17:35 @MikeDiaz285 @SoBeCruzGirl The banning of bump stocks by the DOJ states that if you don't turn over your legally purchased stock to the ATF or destroy it in 90 days, you become a felon. You're basically on the same level of murders, rapists, child molesters, etc.
3108 2018-12-19 12:17:07 For better returns buy havells, gvk power, gmr infra and go long on them. 5-10 lakh mixed infestment in theses stocks will make you a multi crorepathi with about 10-15 years...
        Damh sure hurry up !!!!!!
3109 2018-12-19 12:16:58 Being a former sniper or old sniper  I never cared for bump stocks, I’m more about accuracy but I am deeply concerned when the government can change or remove A Right with the stroke of a pen. I trust a challenge will come on those grounds. At one time we had a Constitution. 
3110 2018-12-19 12:16:40 Mostly agree, some stocks do however begin to turn up before the market and can be your biggest winners.
3111 2018-12-19 12:16:35 The only bad thing yesterday was the bump stocks. He did not backdown on the wall and this Reform Bill could actually be something good. Read deeper into those two issues before jumping off any support cliff.
3112 2018-12-19 12:15:43 I love that you just had that on the stocks. Ready to go.
3113 2018-12-19 12:15:40 Agree they also advertise heavy on IG with video ads which is what where most advertisers want. Still have potential on what’s app. Plus what hurting all faang stocks is all the government sticking there nose in. I get market also but main reason is government
3114 2018-12-19 12:14:36 How do you get people to turn in their bump stocks?
Are records kept of who bought them??
3115 2018-12-19 12:14:16 Let's face it - no matter what carats do, Pledis will never listen.

if I use Chartink scanner to fetch list of stocks then monitor them to close above or below the VWAP this also would work right?

3123 2018-12-19 12:11:51 And good thing that Las Vegas shooter used bump stocks or more people would have died (imho). 
If that shooter would’ve taken his time and aimed his rifles instead of using spray and pray, at that distance and from elevation more people would’ve died in the same amount of time.

What do you do in a bear market? A bear market affects both good and bad stocks. Case in point, the Nigerian equities market has continued in the bear territory for more six (6) months, shedding 19.40% in the year so far.

3134 2018-12-19 12:07:50 That’s excatly what the article was about. Lucy McBath won in my district after Republicans held the seat for 40 YEARS. Plus the Trump administration just banned bump stocks. Laws are/will change with help from moms.
3135 2018-12-19 12:07:20 You are jumping the gun sir. Many good quality small caps are still more than 50% below the heights of 2017 and early 2018.  There are some small cap stocks which were in 40s  for years when losses were shown on the books but once profit is shown, the stock languishes at 12-13.
3136 2018-12-19 12:06:58 I like this however you can make the shadows on the colored stocks softer and also add some highlights to them maybe, the shadows really mess with the vibrant theme of this, at least in my opinion, and make that light cover more of the top but less opaque, but still a good job.
3137 2018-12-19 12:05:54 Like I know I SHOULDNT sell because they are just gonna continuously grow bc they are all safe dividend stocks... but gotdamn

3139 2018-12-19 12:05:29 He was told that Obama loved bump stocks. So he banned em.
3140 2018-12-19 12:04:27 You need to pass a bill that goes much further than banning bump stocks. How about banning all assault weapons and any weapon with more than six chambers or six in the magazine? How about real background checks, waiting periods, full licensing and only licensed dealers sales?

3142 2018-12-19 12:04:10 Unfortunately not, stocks are always limited and that's the full list of stockists.
3143 2018-12-19 12:03:48 Banning existing bump stocks is the wrong thing to do.  Stop making them, regulate, register and end private sales.  Much like the current machine gun regs.  Banning will create a black market, legal owners trying to get their money back, only criminals will own!  Bad move!
3144 2018-12-19 12:02:52 For my position sizing and targets it was not an issue.. i trade on limit orders with decent targets . But yes if u dont feel comfortable in this kind of stocks .. just ignore.
3145 2018-12-19 12:02:50 @tonykatz,
I'm not happy about the new law on bump fire stocks. I feel its yet another attack on my 2nd Ammendment.  I have two that I am now obligated to destroy.  But what about Slide Fire stocks? Very similar but different.  What say you?
3146 2018-12-19 12:01:44 A Top Tip for saving money at #Christmas is to buy seasonal items like tinsel and decorations for next year at a huge discount in January when shops need to clear their unsold stocks.
3147 2018-12-19 12:00:17 Because bump stocks suck. They're inaccurate

3155 2018-12-19 11:56:59 Nice use of language mother of young children. I think 45 has a little box filled with items he can use to distract Americans from his legal woes. He said Sessions would be working on bump stocks   and he’s been silent on this issue until today. What’s next? DACA reversal?
3156 2018-12-19 11:56:29 Never  let the government flex it muscle unnecessarily. ESPECIALLY,  the executive branch.
Pass a law, if they must go.
Bump stocks should be *outlawed*, not banned, if they have to go.
3157 2018-12-19 11:56:25 Try again Senator Feinstein spearheaded banning bump stocks long before the administration and Kushner took it up.
3158 2018-12-19 11:56:21 Yeah and mass shootings will continue to happen, bump stocks can also be 3D printed, woohoooo hold this W my friend
3159 2018-12-19 11:55:46 Using Bump stocks will make you a criminal.
3160 2018-12-19 11:54:58 This is a joke. The ban on bump stocks is a token to the left that means nothing. As ridiculous as bump stocks are, you can get the same result using a belt loop. Zero worth, zero accuracy.

3165 2018-12-19 11:52:58 @realDonaldTrump You have empowered liberals, meaning that any weapon used for a mass shooting is now available to be banned like "bump stocks". They will move on to the next device for weaponry. Those stocks are mainly utilized by shooters that have finger dexterity issues.

3183 2018-12-19 11:45:12 But I thought Trump was so terrible. Outlaw bump stocks, criminal justice reform, etc.
3184 2018-12-19 11:44:36 a month after I bought in. I was new to risk investing and the trolls almost had me convinced to sell. Long investors that understood the process of Soc Media and how to undertake a better path of due diligence with High Risk stocks convinced me to hold my shares. I have learned

Yeah some of the criteria they really need to examine. Especially when stocks are running low!!

Is this so they can pay for the wall?

If we do this and no wall gets built, Trump will NOT get my vote in 2020.  
He gave them bump stocks yesterday too.

3194 2018-12-19 11:41:32 Gun ownership is not tracked in 36 of 50 states. Bump stocks are not even guns. So the short answer is not, likely.

3196 2018-12-19 11:40:52 ?? So what! The current annual % change is -4.22% compared to last year. But last year it finished up +25.08% from the previous year which was also up +13.42% from the previous year to that. People clean portfolios and dump stocks in December, Paul, it's the end of the tax year.
3197 2018-12-19 11:40:14 No pain no gain...all those sitting on cash is waiting for the market to bottom out before diving back in and scooping up stocks....

Also we check our portfolios and trade stocks online.
3199 2018-12-19 11:40:02 I LOVE the second amendment, love it and proud to carry but why do we need bump stocks? They are not guns themselves.
3200 2018-12-19 11:39:15 Trump admin bans bump stocks, devices that let rifles fire like machine guns. Hard to believe @POTUS would do anything constructive, but this is good. Kudos to Parkland students. @AMarch4OurLives
3201 2018-12-19 11:39:13 But why did he give them the law against Bump stocks last night?
Give them an inch, the take 10 miles
3202 2018-12-19 11:39:11 This may be a case where the rational behaviour for an individual is not the same as for society. You may be the one who survives (though I wouldn't broadcast the fact that you have such stocks, or you might not have them for very long!)
3203 2018-12-19 11:38:43 Gérer des patients ? On gère des situations, des stocks pas des personnes ! Vous avez une manière très personnelle d utiliser notre belle langue dites donc ....
3204 2018-12-19 11:37:48 Thank you mister Donald for siding with the liberal Democrats on Banning bump stocks that was a great Democratic idea and you stood beside the Democrats one more time thank you I knew there was a little bit left in you for now
3205 2018-12-19 11:37:42 Perused the Donald on Reddit & a few other far right sites. Know what they're not talking about? The Trump admin banning bump stocks. Damn. You would think they'd be in a fuhrer over the news.

3209 2018-12-19 11:36:14 Dumb. Manufactured bump stocks are not even necessary. A criminal who wants auto fire can figure that out with a darn rubber band. Another valley of court cases with only attorneys profiting. #ShallNotInfringe

3211 2018-12-19 11:35:16 Well, you know your business & the extent to which it depends on the EU better than anyone. Make some assumptions about each element, find out about customs requirements for non EU trade at the moment, lay in stocks in advance, check your existing contracts - that sort of stuff?

3215 2018-12-19 11:32:15 Yes, Trump banned bump stocks. He also committed treason. What of it?
3216 2018-12-19 11:31:54 Walang stocks ng grocery. Tapos home alone. Tapos nilalagnat pa. Punyeta. Talagang fastfood na lang ata mkakapitan ko hanggang paguwi ni Mahal
3217 2018-12-19 11:31:33 Exactly its an incremental approach. People didn't care when bump stocks were banned, then it was AR's, then it was semi autos, then ((((POOF))) guns were banned.
3218 2018-12-19 11:31:33 So the new theory is that bump stocks are machine guns that kills hundreds.  So does plane crashes and cruise ships. Oh did I mention war. This is the idiots who blame everything except the ones who are responsible for mass murder like our corrupted government
3219 2018-12-19 11:31:11 Now, as #Trump sees his time as free coming to an end, he decides to ban bump stocks,  he decides maybe no gov’t shut down.  He is trying to look like a good guy in disguise.

3229 2018-12-19 11:25:36 A bump stock is a worthless piece of plastic without a high capacity magazine, any nut can buy parts and follow directions to make a gun fully auto, bump stocks were for the lazy idiots. My point? We are still dancing around making meaningless gestures. That's tRump and the GOP
3230 2018-12-19 11:24:57 Remind me again Piers what Republicans did in the aftermath of Sandy Hook to undermine any of Obama’s attempts at legitimate gun reform? He gets credit for bump stocks but let’s not pretend he’s an advocate of gun reform.

3271 2018-12-19 11:08:14 @seanhannity Gun owners are pissed about the ruling on bumpfire stocks which do NOT allow more than one shot to be fired per trigger pull, this opens the door to more regulations on semi-autos like AR15s.  Trump has screwed over gun owners.

3274 2018-12-19 11:05:53 Idiots who have no idea what they are talking about should keep their mouths shut.

Bumpfiring is possible without the much maligned stocks.

Ban fingers next?
3275 2018-12-19 11:05:20 Tell us how banning bump stocks helps stop mass shootings.

3277 2018-12-19 11:02:35 This will do nothing to stop mass shootings. Nixon did some good stuff, too. But he was also a criminal. What’s your point? How many bump stocks have been bought in the 15 months since Vegas?
3278 2018-12-19 11:02:15 Bump stocks are not protected by the second amendment. That’s it. Very straightforward. 

Restricting our access to them does not inhibit our capacity to defend ourselves.
3279 2018-12-19 11:01:54 Extremely sorry about this experience, the replacement has been created. However, we do not have the product in stock, we are receiving the new stocks by 2nd week of Jan.
3280 2018-12-19 11:00:55 Stocks, please.
3281 2018-12-19 11:00:38 Yeah.... Hey CRIMINALS did ya hear? Bump stocks are going to be illegal so you can't use them any longer ... Get rid of them or turn them in.. I'll wait 
3282 2018-12-19 11:00:06 And actually I did. Sold all my stocks in late July 2008, cashed out nicely, reinvested in 2010. And #brexit prognosis is actually way easier than that.
3283 2018-12-19 10:58:05 December is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks.

The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, October, August and February.
3284 2018-12-19 10:56:42 FED day today. I suspect a 25 basis point rise to be announced that will likely push stocks lower. Will some of that fiat move into bitcoin?

3290 2018-12-19 10:53:13 US government banning bump stocks lmao, just ban guns already. You can easily bump fire any semi auto weapon without a bump stock. What are you gonna do next ban the use of limbs?
3291 2018-12-19 10:53:12 im so bored with the ripple xrp good news and future potential i think i will invest in stocks/shares
3292 2018-12-19 10:52:30 maybe because why they would buy a $400 worth LED TV which is priced at $600,  and a TAG says 70% off.  They don't want us to recognize such TAGs on Stocks and we don't bother finding out either !
3293 2018-12-19 10:52:28 Typically I use RVOL to CONFIRM something is in play.. premarket should be dedicated to finding stocks you PREDICT/THINK might be in play.. so to answer the question, I don’t see RVOL as THE catalyst, it’s confirmation that a catalyst could be present
3294 2018-12-19 10:52:14 @realDonaldTrump I’ve never before praised you for anything, because you’ve never before done anything worth praising. But your action on bump stocks is at least a start, and might save lives. Well done.
3295 2018-12-19 10:51:15 If you want to make money from stock price fluctuation why didn’t you sell at the high? If you didn’t sell at the last high, you won’t sell at the next. Cramer makes money by being clever. Stocks go up or down, he is still clever. For everybody else? Collect your dividend.
3296 2018-12-19 10:50:37 @LIVERA1972 Stock buybacks have been supporting the market, allowing executives to cash out of stocks. There's no value left, that's why the market is crashing. Smart money has figured this out, that's why Bitcoin is going up. Buy more bitcoin or etherium before you spread this.
3297 2018-12-19 10:50:21 “As of Tuesday Takeda, TD Ameritrade, ScotteVest, United Explorer, Just for Men, Voya, Zenni Optical, IHOP, Jaguar, Pacific Life, Indeed, Bowflex, SmileDirectClub, NerdWallet, Minted and Ancestry have all dropped the show.”

Consider leaving all these stocks from your portfolios.
3298 2018-12-19 10:49:36 The Govt has a responsibility to tell the truth. Without conservation measures trawlers will be rusting anyway because there will be no stocks left to fish. But whenever it's wildlife or the environment versus business, our Govt ensures business always wins.

3302 2018-12-19 10:47:51 okay but there's a difference between banning gun stocks and banning guns completely
3303 2018-12-19 10:47:00 The Trump admin just banned bump stocks and supported the passage of a Criminal Justice reform law. Is this the #pivot? Would it matter if it was?
3304 2018-12-19 10:46:39 I agree with the other comments made. The best thing to do is nothing. They’re only paper losses now, selling will only made it much more difficult to make up those losses. Think long term, think of times like this as if stocks are on sale.
3305 2018-12-19 10:45:34 According to who? ,,, pple have stocks of cash in their houses, go to mbare and see groceries being loaded to rural areas!

3306 2018-12-19 10:44:49 I commend him for banning bump stocks, although he should have done it when he originally said he would not wait to throw things he will think will help him gain popularity while his ship is capsizing

In a way pinaghirapan din nila yun kasi sila ang main commodity ng company nila. nagincrease ang stocks kc may trust yung investors sa commodity/product ng company.
3332 2018-12-19 10:24:54 Bump stocks are a modification and not required to operate a firearm. I'm fine with this confiscation. Anything that would interfere basic operation is where I draw the red line. Or if they try to ban firearms all together. Self defense is important and there are bad guys.

 I guess Bump Stocks have some use. But it's more the thought of

I shoot long range so they wouldn't do me much good.
3341 2018-12-19 10:20:53 It’s advantage for most borrowers in the #Nifty Index stocks from trend down in interest cost in alignment with 25-50 bps cut in Repo rate between February-June 2019 for improved earnings! Banks that are good in asset quality stand to gain the most from lower deposit rates!

3394 2018-12-19 09:50:22 Finally he did something right. And banning bump stocks was a great thing!
3395 2018-12-19 09:50:20 Many metrics say economy doing well - seems strange bank stocks down. Spent last hr reading on what they are investing in, including increasing dividend payments, and the various challenges they are facing (rising Corp debt, Europe, pressure from fin tech, interest rates, etc.).
3396 2018-12-19 09:50:11 Bump stocks get banned over an incident that has been swept under the rug. WTF is going on??

3398 2018-12-19 09:48:31 S&P futures up 0.65% chasing EU stocks higher.. DAX up 0.24%.. Many starting to suggest we get a dovish hike from the FED tonight.. A hike with a dovish statement..

3400 2018-12-19 09:48:08 Maybe bump stocks aren't the hill the NRA wants to die on. Maybe resources are better spent on other issues. Maybe skirting the law to a have a gun that fires like a fully automatic weapon just isn't a good idea.

3404 2018-12-19 09:46:12 Hi @stevegrasso - disagree with idea that entire Trump rally will be erased. US Corp tax cuts/repatriation law-changes were a monumental event, and upward repricing of stocks was appropriate. That repricing won't get erased (just my opinion).
3405 2018-12-19 09:46:04 Morning all.. Another dire session on Wall st as fears over trade and global growth weigh on stocks and fears remain that the Fed may continue hiking with a hike fully expected tonight.

3408 2018-12-19 09:44:38 if it's that easy, then nobody will miss bump stocks. right?

and if people do miss bump stocks, then it's not really the same, is it?

3410 2018-12-19 09:44:05 Why the fuck can’t we go medieval style & just put them in the stocks. Then at least we could chuck shit & shove stuff up their orifices instead off booing impotently at the telly ???? #JeremyKyle
3411 2018-12-19 09:43:20 Either you’re a troll or you’re so emotional about this topic that you replace logic with over-generalizations.  Bump stocks convert semi-automatics into automatics.  Since fully automatics are illegal, why should bump stocks be legal?
3412 2018-12-19 09:43:09 Bump stocks spray ammunition very inaccurately.  The bump stock used by the Las Vegas shooter spared more lives, than if the shooter used precisely aimed kill-shots.
3413 2018-12-19 09:40:42 You're not fighting for me I'll tell you that.  Not when you ban bump stocks when you said the Second Amendment was safe with you as President.  You have failed me and the firearms community.

3426 2018-12-19 09:34:20 funny, I always imagined gun control coming from the democrats, not from a president who had claimed to support the 2A only to unilaterally ban bump stocks & violate the the US Const in the very next breath since NO such power was ever delegated (along w/ the 2A, 4A, 5A, 6A& 9A).

3447 2018-12-19 09:16:33 Waiting for  the communication from #Fed on interest rates, the agreement on the #Italian budget makes the stocks fly. Meanwhile, the EUR/USD pair rallied back to over one-week tops, further beyond the USD1,1400
3448 2018-12-19 09:16:23 What part about bump stocks do you disagree on?
3449 2018-12-19 09:16:13 Have you checked the returns for these stocks. All top performing ELSS are avoid as per you. Can check over 3, 6, or 9 year periods.

3455 2018-12-19 09:10:50 @realDonaldTrump I think you really opened a Pandora’s Box on bump stocks and bump stock confiscation !
The left will take advantage of this and will enforce confiscation of ALL GUNS as mandated by the Socialist New World Order !
Problem IS NO WAY America will give them up !
3456 2018-12-19 09:10:32 Then why are there bump stocks?
Any modification to make a gun automatic is illegal and should not be minimized or encouraged. Nice false equivalency you got there though...

3470 2018-12-19 09:04:30 Now we speaking a little more the same language  But still agree to disagree about bump stocks.

3472 2018-12-19 09:03:54 One small point to bear in mind: with stocks, bonds, and most other assets showing only minor gains, if not outright losses, for the year, imagine how bad the US #budget will look without the traditional, bull-market boost in April next.

3473 2018-12-19 09:03:48 You do something that's actually good like banning bump stocks because I read about that and that's actually a good thing and then turn around and say something completely moronic later on Twitter. why????? I just don't get it. I'm an independent and will always be because both
3474 2018-12-19 09:03:36 That and the fact he can’t see what an absolute shite job this manager has done, just relying on youth during tough spells isn’t right! Need all the experience you can get.
3475 2018-12-19 09:02:45 That’s a good way to go when the stocks drop in value just buy bulk and maybe hold until Q3/4ish

3480 2018-12-19 08:59:22 Usually President has far less impact on markets and economy then people think. However, Trump absurd tax give away making deficit soar, tariff war, attacking Fed has had a real negative impact on markets. I pulled everything out of stocks & put in bond funds beginning September
3481 2018-12-19 08:58:46 Wonder where Epsom keep their stocks nowadays?
3482 2018-12-19 08:58:46 People do not CHEER when things are going up, that is their job as the President to ensure this, I did not cheer as stocks went up for 8 straight years of Obama, and I KNOW that you did not (Liberal hater) so why issue hypocritical cynicism to you opponents? Look in the mirror.
3483 2018-12-19 08:58:30 If bump stocks are outlawed, only outlaws will have bump stocks!
3484 2018-12-19 08:58:25 That may mean banning of bump stocks never gets passed (for whatever reason), but that’s how our government works. Again, how you feel about bump stocks doesn’t matter. They do not turn a semi-automatic rifle into an automatic rifle.

3503 2018-12-19 08:46:00 Wat doet Trump nu? Hij verbiedt bump-stocks, waarmee je geweren volautomatisch kan laten schieten en hij hervormd het strafrechtsysteem, waardoor gevangen sneller vervroegd kunnen vrijgelaten worden. Hij lijkt wel democratisch! #DonaldTrump

3514 2018-12-19 08:42:31 Normally you only pay Capital Gains tax on securities, such as stocks and shares. Should be tax free if declared a non- security. Hopefully we get to the stage, as is happening, where we justspend as money today!

3516 2018-12-19 08:40:09 Bump stocks are not protected by the 2nd amendment.
3517 2018-12-19 08:39:52 Holy shit. Trump actually fulfilled a campaign promise. He actually banned bump stocks. Huh. I didn't expect that. Good job, Trumpy boy.
3518 2018-12-19 08:39:49 They banned bump stocks.
3519 2018-12-19 08:39:22 Mate, this forum tonight where he’s said the fans aren’t going to like what I say is worrying!  Yeah he’s been awful and injured all season not been right since his knee injury. 
3520 2018-12-19 08:38:55 When #Trump bans bump stocks, guess who will be the only ones to have them. That’s right. Criminals.

@realDonaldTrump
3521 2018-12-19 08:38:40 You know things aren’t going well for the WH when banning bump stocks isn’t even the story of the day.
3522 2018-12-19 08:38:31 that's great Susan change my vote Collins but bump stocks don't kill people, guns do.
3523 2018-12-19 08:38:10 Stocks are set to bounce
3524 2018-12-19 08:36:50 You tried to use it as an example of how bump stocks aren’t a problem since a lot of people died, ignoring that it took essentially an army for Wounded Knee to happen and for the Las Vegas shooting, it only took one man because of the weapons he chose.
3525 2018-12-19 08:36:02 yea this is one of the ETFs 

There are some mining stocks $EFR $EU $FSY $FSY $GLO $AZZ $CCO $NXE $U to name a few but I guess you would need to dig deeper into how they are doing in their operations and geo politics etc.
3526 2018-12-19 08:35:23 Australian stocks eased on Wednesday, weighed down by the energy sector as the price of US crude plummeted almost 8% – taking the key commodity's losses in the past three sessions to 13% – on fears of a supply glut. The S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 8.9 points, or 0.2%, to 5580.6.
3527 2018-12-19 08:35:03 Only as long as they don't use bump stocks, though.
3528 2018-12-19 08:34:16 Yes, speed limits exist to help prevent/lower accidents. It wasn’t an argument, it was an analogy. To quote MLK to defend the rights of keeping bump stocks is egregious. And what “gun laws” are you eluding too? Last time I check the laws that are in place are not sufficient.

3530 2018-12-19 08:32:21 @realDonaldTrump so your attempt to appease the dems by giving them bump stocks, but dont you get it? They’ll take all the crumbs you give them until they have the whole damn cake!! Stop listening to the NRA b4 you loose 2020!! And what happened to the monetary compensation??
3531 2018-12-19 08:32:20 I could make the #stockmarket more money for myself and the entire world. It’s amazing to even be able to say this to myself. It’s like a musician becoming an artist. Either you got the #dna to become a major performer. It blows my mind when I see my #actions affect the #stocks.
3532 2018-12-19 08:31:31 Holy fuck...Trump actually banned bump stocks. Wonder how his gun loving fans will feel about that. He actually did something for gun control. I’m literally speechless
3533 2018-12-19 08:30:34 isnt it a bit insane with all the hate trump gets from the democrats, that the moment he does something actually unconstitutional, (ban bump stocks) that they (dems) all sit quietly idle and silently applaud this.
3534 2018-12-19 08:27:22 @PeteSnodden @PSRebecca  my mum stocks up on shloer on offer at Christmas & could have over 60 bottles in her cupboard. She uses it every Sunday with dinner lol
3535 2018-12-19 08:25:44 Tell the guests at the Las Vegas Route 91 Harvest Music Festival that there's nothing to be gained from banning bump stocks.
3536 2018-12-19 08:24:43 Royaume-Uni : C'est l'apocalypse on sait pas si on va pouvoir assurer les stocks de nourriture et de médicament avec le Brexit.
France : Tiens, et si on faisait des référendums nous aussi ?
3537 2018-12-19 08:24:23 Our local sport shooting club banned these some time ago. There’s no reason behind bump stocks except the novelty factor. The rapid recoil makes accuracy a joke... unless your target is the size of a billboard.

3548 2018-12-19 08:15:40 So the options are a $166 stock or one of the $10 under stocks?
3549 2018-12-19 08:15:39 I think the ability to trade stocks is the  gateway to raise funds. So that entrepreneurs will unleash their potential & that may propel economic growth. But the regulatory mechanisms shld be in place as well. Otherwise you can be robbed in a day light.
3550 2018-12-19 08:14:39 Issues? Very little manufactured in UK, those that do not competitive, ie around 20-30% higher costs, poor slow delivery, limited stocks, leaving potentially means tariffs, poorer trading position

3552 2018-12-19 08:14:29 Stocks up 46% under Obama & 12% under Trump (dropping) (first 2 yrs thru 12/17). If you Glory in stock market you also die by it.

3554 2018-12-19 08:14:23 Whatever it takes to protect folks.  What's your idea?  You lose privacy when leave home. The NRA apparently caved on bump stocks.  Guess they pick their battles.
3555 2018-12-19 08:14:08 It seems to me nuclear capability is misunderstood. When first used in '45, irradiation was unknown until '53. 2ly economic benefit of conquest became meaningless. Missile guidance offered precision, but larger stocks made this meaningless.
3556 2018-12-19 08:13:23 There was euphoria in crypto which took the place of what we usually see in small caps. The charts of the FAANG stocks and their ilk very clearly demonstrate euphoria and blow off tops. It may not have felt like broad euphoria but it was there

3561 2018-12-19 08:10:26 Hey he did a good thing for a change. Credit where due. I'd encourage an armistice on handing back bump stocks.
3562 2018-12-19 08:08:17 The earrings were gifts. Please note, gifts are usually offered while stocks last. it therefore not guaranteed that you will get the gift but very few lucky and randomly selected shoppers get to walk away with the gift. ^LK

3564 2018-12-19 08:07:56 Dangerous slope - the language used says bump stocks turn semi-autos into machine guns.  Therefore, the next argument could be that all semi-autos are "readily-convertible" into machine guns.  Especially when you consider everything from rubber bands to belt loops can also do it.
3565 2018-12-19 08:07:40 He says WTIC will move to 40  then to 50s and then to 10 level later in 2019 ( depth of deflation)

3583 2018-12-19 07:59:10 This action appears to be right out of the Obama playbook - but surprisingly it's from Trump's. I have no dog in the fight regarding bump stocks, but the gov't should buy existing devices so as not to be a 'taking' and not turn otherwise lawful owners into criminals overnight.

3604 2018-12-19 07:46:32 Yes, because the EU has never done anything for fishermen, or sustainable stocks, or farming. I work with a charity who has been assisting new fishermen with boats, safety equipment and other goods. The funding? From the EU.

3606 2018-12-19 07:44:19 @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks is just more infringement and it's not going to save anyone. All it will accomplish is negating much of the good that you have already done. Only criminals and tyrannical authority will possess superior fire power. That's not MAGA.

3623 2018-12-19 07:38:28 So it took 2 years to get to a deal that is crap and no one will support it. If we have no deal do you honestly think that the Tories will be able to negotiate 100's of deals in 6 weeks before stocks run out? This is all a blackmail tactic, we will remain rather than no deal.

3629 2018-12-19 07:35:27 Get woke, go broke. See EA stocks. You guys will crash and burn before next year is out. Nice knowing you, enjoy your plummet to the bottom. I doubt people would come back to your platform if you begged them and offered them public, individual apologies. Freedom of speech matters
3630 2018-12-19 07:35:11 No offense, but really bad answer. The point is not about your feelings about bump stocks, or whether you, personally would buy one, or whether you think they’re dumb. The point is this action is very dangerous. 1/2
3631 2018-12-19 07:34:35 I encountered a weird bug in doubles online smash where one person accidentally SD'd and lost both of his stocks at once. The other team and I all stopped playing and just stared in confusion for a bit

Fund managers are reducing their exposure despite falling valuations making stocks look cheap
3634 2018-12-19 07:32:24 It sounds like the law will require surrender of bump stocks within 90 days. Anyone found in possession of such a device thereafter will be charged with a felony crime. 

Of course that only means so much.
3635 2018-12-19 07:32:19 We have most of the fish stocks, renewables , oil etc.
3636 2018-12-19 07:32:07 Forget the nifty. The breadth across stocks is awesome today. So many stocks up 4-10% today
3637 2018-12-19 07:31:53 Our next aim should be get FEMA amended to get such stocks listed here
3638 2018-12-19 07:31:00 Military has no need for bump stocks, they have access to full auto weapons and with all due respect, veterans have been in just as many altercations as anyone else. 

A case could even be made that veterans should undergo more scrutiny before being allowed access to firearms
3639 2018-12-19 07:30:48 I hope you like talking about Stocks because your boy got out of his writers block, we're talking about Stocks in the new video I'm working on...
3640 2018-12-19 07:30:03 Jetzt wo trump sich persönlich gegen bump stocks ausgesprochen hat ist es aber plötzlich nicht sein verbot sondern die der US regierung. Man kann diesen typen, so kacke er auch ist nicht eine gute sache abgewinnen. Egal was er macht, es ist falsch oder es war nicht seine idee.
3641 2018-12-19 07:28:56 Well done Andrew. It's great seeing something being accomplished by real hard work, rather than seeing kids putting on walkouts, die-ins, and marches, while being used by social justice warriors. Banning bump stocks and reversing the Promise Act in the same week.
3642 2018-12-19 07:28:22 I keep reading comments and news articles about the Las Vegas shooter and the bump stocks. 
I’m still waiting to see evidence of someone shooting a gun out of that window. 

I will be right here ...... waiiiiting for you.
3643 2018-12-19 07:28:13 ask question please @cnbcKaren 

To Guest 

Are you buying stocks now?

why not sell everything at present with global outlook - move to cash ??

( like selling house move into rental but back 12 -18 moths 20-25% cheaper)

if he says NO hold - ask Why - is he still buying?
3644 2018-12-19 07:27:12 you are better off shorting most stocks then buying into them.
3645 2018-12-19 07:27:06 These are all penny stocks, mostly from healthy companies beat down by macro effects.
3646 2018-12-19 07:26:50 We have seen some positive news coming out of Congress and the WH. Criminal justice reform, banning bump stocks. Is it okay to feel happy about these things or am I missing something?
3647 2018-12-19 07:26:20 Bump stocks are banned interesting. 
3648 2018-12-19 07:26:19 I read this right after I read the article about the guy who predicted the last 2 crashes and what stocks he said to pick. Business insider.
3649 2018-12-19 07:25:51 Bump stocks are just a give away. They actual slow most people down. It’s really easy to convert a gun to automatic. So no biggie.
3650 2018-12-19 07:25:42 shout outs to homie stocks
3651 2018-12-19 07:24:57 And here we have someone who doesn't have a clue voicing his uninformed opinion. 

First off, automatics are not illegal. 

Secondly, bump stocks still only allow a rifle to fire one round per actuation of the trigger. 

Educate yourself.
3652 2018-12-19 07:24:13 Everyone who has followed me knows my hatred for Trump. 

This being said I will now shock you by praising Republicans and Trump for new laws banning bunt stocks and criminal justice reform well done Potus..
3653 2018-12-19 07:24:03 Bump stocks banned after Las Vegas massacre
3654 2018-12-19 07:24:01 If you have to use a bump stock to hit a target then you should take up knitting instead. You suck as a marksman. Even the military stopped issuing automatic M16s because they were useless in combat. Calling bump-stocks a right is pure stupidity.

2) I'm sorry but those shares are worthless now, you've lost all your money. I can offer you these penny stocks for The Grub tho. The economy is going well.
3667 2018-12-19 07:15:20 Mid day update (19 Dec):- Local stocks once again regained strength in early afternoon trade. Sensex up 104 and Nifty up 42 points. Heavyweight and housing finance major HDFC gained. IT stocks dropped. Mid-Cap up 1.47%. Small-Cap up 1.07%. Both these outperformed the Sensex.
3668 2018-12-19 07:14:34 Stocks collapse on that outcome

3672 2018-12-19 07:12:45 For friends who track me : seeing disturbing chart trends in WTIC and also copper is looking weak, below 2.64 we target 2.46, is it a global deflation cycle catching up, Looking at base metal/EVMetals /Oil stocks , this looks like a possibility.
3673 2018-12-19 07:12:09 I can't believe that Trump is banning bump stocks. I oppose him on this. Bump stocks are not weapons. This is unconstitutional.
3674 2018-12-19 07:11:50 After losing multi million dollar lawsuits and massive publicity, it’s an attempt to stall their nosediving stocks.

3683 2018-12-19 07:07:09 Said that many times.
But - if you're working in a fast-food joint and your income is nil and rather stable - you can't invest in #stocks anyhow because you barely can pay the minimal bills and your income's not soaring.

USD-INR at 70, Crude around $56 .... everything looks favorable. Only which stock will make a big move which day will be difficult to predict
3692 2018-12-19 07:04:24 Nifty Top 5 stocks have not been participating in the recent rally for the last 3-5 days. Watched your videos on %D, TQ and Price. Can sense what we can expect as you had mentioned.
3693 2018-12-19 07:04:19 Morning market call:
19/12/2018
Stocks expected to report:
very little corporate reporting as we move into the end of year break
Economic data today: 
US Interest rates decision
FOMC Chief Powell statement
US Existing home sales
UK CPI

The Fed is likely to hike rates today.
3694 2018-12-19 07:03:49 Galactic and diverse debt bombs hold potentials far worse than "2000's" fake concept stocks, which fooled only fools.  A decade's mass fiscal derangement posing as strategy must inevitably deliver a [further] loss of liberty.

3704 2018-12-19 06:58:52 @realDonaldTrump ATF must have a short memory, they don't recall their 3 previous determinations on bump stocks under the Obamanation. They didn't think it was a machine gun then, but under a RINO they can narrow the scope of the 2nd amendment
3705 2018-12-19 06:54:28 (Of course, I'm thinking Canadian military. Our rifles are still made with wood stocks because plastic cracks in forty below.)
3706 2018-12-19 06:54:17 Sympathy? Your federal colleagues have been hijacked by the coal loving, anti-AGW NP numpties mainly from Qld, they should be put in wooden stocks and be pelted with rotten fruit. Only an election will rid us of these culcha war vultures.
3707 2018-12-19 06:52:34 This right here is why I think buying a Mossberg Shockwave would be a mistake. Buying a short barreled shotgun because they say its peg-like grip somehow makes it immune to required shotgun barrel length, seems pretty iffy to me. 
I always felt bump stocks were iffy, too.

3712 2018-12-19 06:50:06 The 30 or so stocks I trade in and out of need to meet these critera:

Diversified big cap
Large distribution system
Profitable - average ROEs 16%
Pays a dividend - average yields 3%+
Low to moderate leverage
No financials (see leverage)
Investment grade debt rating
+ a few golds

3716 2018-12-19 06:47:40 I just think it is all of the above.

3738 2018-12-19 06:37:54 No need for a bump stocks
3739 2018-12-19 06:37:28 That means you would rather buy WL stocks at their lower end than ZSE. Unless maybe you are buying Zse stocks for charity or patriotism.
The main challenge with Zse stocks comes when yu want to dispose.

3750 2018-12-19 06:33:17 The bump stock ban is important because it is a capitulation to those who would have citizens completely disarmed. Bump stocks are by themselves not particularly useful, but there is nothing to be gained by letting them get banned, and everything to lose.
3751 2018-12-19 06:31:40 Sadly, this does very little. Looks like it just bump stocks. Pretty sure there are many, many other accessories that do the same thing but won’t be covered under the ban.  Hate to be cynical but it another hollow Trumo diversion.

3755 2018-12-19 06:27:28 Mimo by M usually stocks it and they deliver all over Pakistan (I used to stock up on them religiously back when I was in khi)
3756 2018-12-19 06:26:21 The dividends will be used to buy stocks in index and show up as NAV. The market price tracks the NAV so should reflect this.
3757 2018-12-19 06:26:02 That’s the point many miss. This isn’t just about bump-stocks. It’s about the Constitution, separation of powers, statutory construction, APA, due process, Takings, tax law, ...........
3758 2018-12-19 06:25:59 Bump stocks and now this. Next week he'll probably sign an executive order requiring all puppies be crushed, just to restore balance to the force.
3759 2018-12-19 06:25:47 Bump stocks ban will not stop and/or deter mass shootings.
3760 2018-12-19 06:24:45 A ban on bump stocks plus prison reform. That's day to be proud of US government.
3761 2018-12-19 06:24:40 @steve_sedgwick @cnbcKaren Oil & Gas , Banks, Consumer stocks are the best portofolio which i think your expert has it.
3762 2018-12-19 06:24:35 The number of times I have read about stocks being in the 'buy zone' the past couple of months...
3763 2018-12-19 06:24:24 I'm buying popcorn stocks. The NYSE would like that!
3764 2018-12-19 06:24:19 @realDonaldTrump so you're banning Bump Stocks and now backing down from Building the Wall????  WTH???  What happened to Donald Trump, the guy we voted for?

3766 2018-12-19 06:23:06 Time for another donation. Even if you don’t care for bump stocks, there’s a deeper principle here - what is the limit of ATFs statutory authority?  Does anyone know?  This is fucking crazy. Turn over your possessions?

3768 2018-12-19 06:22:24 Given the fact 99.99% of the people didn't know what bump stocks were until the Vegas shooting- loosing them isn't that big of a deal.  As for building the Wall I blame the reluctant Rinos for not supporting the President.
3769 2018-12-19 06:22:19 Trump administration banning bump stocks is causing gun owners to prove their own point that when guns are banned only criminals will have guns. 
Because they are now the criminals.

3770 2018-12-19 06:21:35 I have 6 buy orders in for tomorrow (stop buys - I prefer trailing stops so I'm at least buying a modicum of strength in a decline); 1 sell (profit-taking on a silver stock). At some point soon Cdn oil stocks are going to be the "why-didn't-I-buy-some-then?" buy of the decade.
3771 2018-12-19 06:21:17 Exactly . Everybody is throwing their cash in stocks because they cant get it anyway. The challenge is whether that money can be liquidated into USD when the economy fully dolarise. I foresee a total crush.
3772 2018-12-19 06:21:10 bump stocks are'nt needed if you know how to use the weapon.I bet it was only the ghetto lame asses that bought them.
3773 2018-12-19 06:21:05 So today is manual labour day in our tiny office. Filling newly arrived book cupboards with stocks lying outside. Heave-ho!

3778 2018-12-19 06:18:20 Child poverty is happening all over the world!

They dont care!
3779 2018-12-19 06:17:51 Bump stocks are a unnecessary contrivance. A gimmick. In the event fully automatic fire becomes necessary, no law will be able to prevent me from drilling a hole, installing an auto sear, disconect, selector and bolt carrier to obtain select fire capability from an AR15.

3785 2018-12-19 06:15:39 Can anyone name how many crimes have involved bump stocks? The ironic thing here is once this law goes into effect that number will sky rocket making criminals out of good people. I remember what good people did back in 1776 when an overreaching govt tried to outlaw their arms.

3788 2018-12-19 06:15:34 Certainly not true. Charts don't determine the future price of stocks for example. Value is what drives price discovery. If a stock is generating free cash flow, then that will determine the market price, not some silly lines on a chart...
3789 2018-12-19 06:13:59 Trump administration bans bump stocks
- this is unconstitutional. 
HEY @DNC hes pitched you a softball right down the center of the box, hit it.
3790 2018-12-19 06:11:57 To those who voted for Democrats in the midterms, appreciate the effect as Trump offers aid to Central America, got rid of bump stocks, and has a crime bill to sign. Dems should have nominated him. He's incredibly pliable because he can't stand heat. He needs to be praised.
3791 2018-12-19 06:10:30 Just like everyone had the secret formula for winning during the 10 year bull market. I can’t wait for capitulation tweets / swearing off stocks / cash balances held / ‘waiting for bottom’ tweets next year. Sigh.

3797 2018-12-19 06:06:38 If they did it, it was for monetary gain, the reason they do everything is to advance the stocks, bonds, CDs, certificates & hedge funds, fatten up that portfolio, an apology,a congressional hearing, then on to the next Glitch,Bull
3798 2018-12-19 06:06:05 What stocks do you own again? I think I know a couple of them. Which one are you worried about?
3799 2018-12-19 06:06:00 When they chanted “Lock her up” did they mean law abiding citizens who own bump stocks? No? Cause in 90 days they have to be handed over to the government or else. So dumb.
3800 2018-12-19 06:05:57 So  write a bill that doesn't allow members to own stock or vote on stocks they own.

3803 2018-12-19 06:04:00 The White House did two good things today: 

• Banned bump stocks
• Prison reform bill

Doesn’t excuse the bad things but give credit where credit is due
3804 2018-12-19 06:03:38 Ive noticed a drastic change in Trump in the last few days.
Bad feeling that dems have threatened him and are now keeping him in office to do their bidding.
Caves on funding for wall.
Ban on bump stocks.
Criminal Justice Reform bill.
Now $10bill for SAmerica.
Something is off.
3805 2018-12-19 06:03:08 Money is in stocks. but we are still some time away from earnings turnaround and market bottoming.
3806 2018-12-19 06:03:00 Please.  The market(s) meaning housing, stocks, resources are all bubbles!  They have been!  This entire nation is a fraud!  Built on bullshit and lies!  It’s kinda sad that that we just follow the leaders lies!

3807 2018-12-19 06:02:36 Honestly I don’t have an issue with banning bump stocks...I love hunting and love guns but at the end of the day, if I can’t go out and buy a bump stock then really I don’t give a crap.  Never really saw the use in it anyway.

3819 2018-12-19 05:58:59 Interest rates flat w/ 8 years of Obama. Now they're being increased. Stocks hate that. DERP.
3820 2018-12-19 05:58:28 I believe that. That's why I research everything. This is an interesting conversation I'm learning things. Who would have thought bump stocks have been out 10 years.
3821 2018-12-19 05:58:24 Bump stocks regulation is a positive first step in the right direction!
3822 2018-12-19 05:58:15 All the whatsapp groups with investing tips have started becoming super active, actually hyper active!! As usual, now theyre chasing large cap stocks!! Time to back pedal.. #contrarian
3823 2018-12-19 05:58:05 That high? Hmmm now I have to rethink my data. A correction looks at overpriced stocks. Some still are very high without strong earnings.
3824 2018-12-19 05:57:40 It is amazing that everybody swore the Democrats were coming for their firearms but reality it's the GOP that's coming for the bump stocks. When the Russian money dries up the NRA dries up and with Trump & the GOP backs are against the wall they voted to make bump stocks illegal
3825 2018-12-19 05:56:59 If he had decided to aim rather than spray and pray, there would have been far more fatalities. All of his targets were lying on the ground in full view. His using bump stocks probably saved lives...
3826 2018-12-19 05:56:02 I personally believe that some of the Russian money filtered through the NRA and other corporations made their way into the pockets of the GOP leaders. they are afraid that if Trump goes down he will pull them all down. If anybody noticed bump stocks are now illegal!
3827 2018-12-19 05:55:38 There was never any share buyback. It was reported to Whistle blower on Sept. 2018 of this year and progress is still going on. Just keep your eyes on it... don't marry it. OTC Stocks failed alot of promises.
3828 2018-12-19 05:55:30 Bump stocks killed alot of people so watch out if you see one walking down the street it just might bump you 
3829 2018-12-19 05:54:58 Sorry what compromises I was willing to reach are no longer available I donate to pro gun groups and even though bump stocks are stupid I will continue to call and write representatives all over the country I will bring people who have never shot a gun before and get them

3832 2018-12-19 05:52:47 That's why I am trying to understand. Correct they are scary when you don't know what they are. I live in Vegas and the shooter her had his guns equipped with bump stocks. I saw the damage & it was unimaginable to me why a person would want so much power in a gun & for what?

3838 2018-12-19 05:51:51 This is moronic. Bump stocks ARE NOT MACHINE GUNS!!!!!
Machine guns fire multiple rounds each time the trigger is pulled. Bump stocks allow the shooter to pull the trigger at a faster rate. Learn how to speak English or find some other line of work
3839 2018-12-19 05:51:36 There’s no justification for semi-automatic guns except in the hands of police or our military.  Ban on bump stocks won’t solve the killing of our school children or our Christian or Jewish Americans in churches.  Until Congress stands up to the NRA, this will never happen.  
3840 2018-12-19 05:51:03 Bump stocks and prison reform are good things and credit is due. However begrudgingly if he signs it into law, I will celebrate that decision.
3841 2018-12-19 05:51:01 #stockmarkets in turmoil Europe debt crisis (again), Trump impeachment probable, China economy slowing, US-China trade war, rising interest rates, tax loss selling.....the "perfect storm"!  Great thing about dividend stocks you get paid while you wait.

3848 2018-12-19 05:49:25 It seems the NRA can’t afford to buy Donald off anymore so....buh bye bump stocks.  I’ll soon be happy to say buh bye NRA. 
3849 2018-12-19 05:49:12 Most relevant news of the day!  To people who don't care about massive corruption at all levels of the GOP, or banning bump stocks, or having souls...
3850 2018-12-19 05:49:00 You’re just saying what 95% of Americans think. What is argument for bump stocks ? Good for mass murder ... what other use for civilians not in a combat zone ? I just don’t see a viable arguement.
3851 2018-12-19 05:48:56 i give u the example i got tow stocks, $bergerpaint and ubl of nseindia holding on 8/12of 2 futures for overnight and got huge money today,
3852 2018-12-19 05:48:45 @realDonaldTrump with all due respect- the Executive Order to bad so-called “bump stocks” is an insanely bad idea. Not because I own or see value in them (I don’t) but because this is an executive over-reach on top of being #unconstitutional
3853 2018-12-19 05:48:34 @realDonaldTrump Don't cave and give Communism a win by banning bump stocks.  They are just a gimmick anyway.. but the Democrats will never be satisfied until every gun (except theirs) is melted down.
3854 2018-12-19 05:48:27 (1)-
Since the Trump meeting with Pelosi and Schumer something has drastically changed with Trump’s agenda.
He seems to be abandoning his political stance and gravitating towards leftist policies.
Bump stocks banning
Criminal Justice Reform bill
Caved on funding for the Wall
3855 2018-12-19 05:48:12 I know this though. Moms STOCKS the fridge with wine when I get home. 
3856 2018-12-19 05:48:04 The Trump administration banned bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms.
3857 2018-12-19 05:47:51 If guns don’t kill people, people kill people, I’m curious what the rational is behind banning bump stocks but not the gun. Oh wait, that’s right, we’re talking about people that can’t spot a treasonous, fake religion spewing, spawn of Satan when he’s right in front of them.
3858 2018-12-19 05:47:50 Anything to say about bump stocks being banned
3859 2018-12-19 05:47:39 Wait. Didn't President Obama tell us the rising Stock Market was his ideaThen proceeded to say and btw "Thank you Obama". Let's not leave out the fact that stocks started taking downward turn when Democrats won the House. btw "Thank you Democrats...Not" 
3860 2018-12-19 05:47:38 I don't care to use bump stocks but seriously  turn them in or destroy them??? Your fucking nuts, fuck you. I hope you fucking learn the price for that bullshit. You should have stuck with a ban on sales nothing else. I don't give a shit about bump stocks, betrayal is in the air.
3861 2018-12-19 05:47:30 Lol. Autocorrect. Yes I meant stocks
3862 2018-12-19 05:46:49 This is not how the constitution works you tyrannical hacks. Confiscating bump stocks is a total violation of #2A and completely inconsistent with congressional statute. Stop infringing on the right of the people to keep and bear arms
3863 2018-12-19 05:46:26 They’ve been destroying the middle class, the heart of this nation, slowly but surely. But now w/trump & his greedy & corrupt agenda they found the opportunity to blatantly pass that tax scam & they trade stocks based on what they know he will do. We live in a banana republic.
3864 2018-12-19 05:46:23 I have been an investor myself for close to 15 years. And I see no problem with ltcg. Over the long term payment of 10% ltcg should not be a big dent. Choose stocks wisely
3865 2018-12-19 05:45:58 What do u guys think will happen in the market tmrw? #stocks
3866 2018-12-19 05:45:53 The folks speculating on the video gaming market don't know the gaming market. Stocks like Nintendo are about as well understood as Tesla. When investors are hitting like 20+ p/e, the fundamentals are out the window. 
That said - profits are going to be  for the Switch.
3867 2018-12-19 05:45:43 Bump stocks don’t really matter to me. But, we’ll have to see what the house does. Also, I’m sure that it will be tied up in the courts for awhile. I’m just meaning liberals won’t stop until guns are out of the U.S. citizens hands and our rights are taken away.
3868 2018-12-19 05:45:28 Glad to see that bump stocks are banned.
3869 2018-12-19 05:45:16 Only reddit could shit on trump for banning bump stocks.  Un fucking real.
3870 2018-12-19 05:45:12 Going back to tracking data on specific sets ups on higher priced stocks, worked for gap and craps should work again. You gotta do ur own research to find what works for you.

3873 2018-12-19 05:44:16 Thank you God, for the banning of Bump Stocks for guns....as an RN, a mom & a woman who views life as a miracle, precious and given to us by you, this will undoubtedly help safe precious lives.
3874 2018-12-19 05:44:09 My buddy started chemo today and it’s hitting me fucking hard. We became Corporals of Marines on the same day and worked out together all the time. We talked nerdy Apple shit for hours and invested in stocks. We left SoCal together, stay strong Lyons.
3875 2018-12-19 05:44:09 There are many white people that tried to capitalised on these drives. I was pushed out and retired at 47 and is now 64. Luckily I use my compentacies to trade stocks to counter poverty. ANG is good to me.
3876 2018-12-19 05:44:08 GDP? It’s going down this quarter, it’s on average been lower since Trump took office, but you’ll talk about 2 quarters? I’m asking you how many jobs he created from the tax cuts, in comparison to the last 10
Years, same for stocks, unemployment, debt, show me it
3877 2018-12-19 05:42:52 The reason stocks $SPY $Comp have sold off is as simple as economic growth is slowing from recently high levels and inflation is decelerating (seen oil lately?) it’s NOT about tariffs. It’s just that simple. Can it get worse? Yes it can.
3878 2018-12-19 05:42:05 Credit where credit is due. Trump's administration is doing good work to ban bump stocks & calling for reducing prison terms for non-violent criminals.
3879 2018-12-19 05:42:03 It is the Dems Elites that short stocks every day by algorithm & then make billions! They are chopping down market! Where is @treasuryry RT!
3880 2018-12-19 05:41:43 It is a pleasant surprise that Mid cap and small cap stocks have started performing. I would wait for behavior of Mid and Small Caps during the next correction before making any investing decision.
#Midcap #SmallCap #NIfty
3881 2018-12-19 05:41:06 I could invest my money into stocks, same thing, you invested into something and hoped for better capital. When shit hit the fan and you didn’t try to pull out then you become consistent, lazy. If i invest my money I’m watching it like a hawk. Shit hit the fan 10 years ago.
3882 2018-12-19 05:39:47 5g is the next hype but in this case its going to actually be a big deal.   Within tech these are the only stocks doing extremely well given the market.  $insg $keys $viav $avgo $acia $xlnx $lscc etc
3883 2018-12-19 05:39:39 Wow. I didn't know that. Then making bump stocks is not a deterrant when there are other avenues
3884 2018-12-19 05:39:38 And your point is? That's right only radicals are for the bump stocks. #radicalnutjob
3885 2018-12-19 05:38:56 President Trump’s administration
 has just banned bump stocks.
What have you done but whine about losing your 2nd Presidential election?
3886 2018-12-19 05:38:24 I forget where in the 2nd Amendment does it mention bump stocks?
3887 2018-12-19 05:37:59 Yet the ATF ruled against bump fire stocks, violating 2nd, 4th,and 14th amendments.
3888 2018-12-19 05:37:43 Yall lil niggas think, a new (USA-based) sports car, a chain, & a two-bedroom apt. is success...Yall can have that now. Me & my niggas all want our own 40 acres with a pool & a lake. With 1.5 million invested in stocks. Money doing cart-wheels over each other.
3889 2018-12-19 05:37:28 Maybe one day you'll understand what stocks & bonds are and how they work. I'm not going to waste any more time talking in circles.
3890 2018-12-19 05:35:56 Inspite of no news in Sharda Crop Chem, stock is up by almost 12%. Anybody knows why? @RBI @SEBI_India @NSEIndia @BSEIndia #Sensex #Nifty #India #equity #market #NSE #BSE #SEBI #stocks
3891 2018-12-19 05:34:14 Except at the same time he pushed arming teachers, provided no funding for school safety and put no compliance mechanism in plac, who is going to check if stocks are destroyed-all smoke & mirrors.
3892 2018-12-19 05:33:41 They said "@BillClinton is coming for your guns". They said "@BarackObama is coming for your guns". They said "@TheDemocrats are coming for your guns". The fact is: They are all going to come for your guns. Banning bump stocks, not allowing medical marijuana users to own guns,
3893 2018-12-19 05:33:39 FYI the Saudis did not use bump stocks in Vegas.
3894 2018-12-19 05:32:58 I propose that bump stocks be made irrelevant by ending the ban on fully automatic machine guns.
3895 2018-12-19 05:32:48 Bump stocks banned. Mass shootings over. You're welcome.
3896 2018-12-19 05:32:34 An entertainment company cannot ignore its fans. They are dependent upon the fans for money and buisness. Especially the majority of K-carats who are boycotting. They WILL post a feedback soon because their stocks will drop otherwise. Please count on it.
3897 2018-12-19 05:31:25 Wow.. Trump admin actually put a ban on bump stocks. I'm shook.
3898 2018-12-19 05:29:25 Sooner or later stocks will also have weekly expiry thn we would be able to say now stock market is gambling.......
3899 2018-12-19 05:28:34 Wahhh sampai pukul berapa? Or while stocks last lol
3900 2018-12-19 05:27:52 You going to delete all their stocks?

3903 2018-12-19 05:26:05 That being said, the SCOTUS did rule that Bump Stocks, even 3D Printed ones, were protected by the Second Amendment, but also admitted it was due to how Vague the 2nd Amendment is (since it's so outdated). Still, they left it up for the States to decide this matter, nonetheless.
3904 2018-12-19 05:25:12 If fed raises rates tomorrow stocks will continue their downward trend due to fear of tightening of liquidity... if fed doesn’t raise interest rates stocks will continue their downward trend as it will signal lack of confidence in economic growth... lose, lose? or me plain wrong?
3905 2018-12-19 05:25:06 @realDonaldTrump YOU BETRAYED US
  WHATS WORSE YOU JUST LOST MY VOTE LETS SEE YOU STAY IN OFFICE WITHOUT THE GUN VOTE BANNING BUMP STOCKS IS A PRECURSOR TO BANNING ALL SEMI AUTOS BECAUSE YOU DONT NEED A STOCK TO BUMP FIRE
ALL YOU NEED IS YOUR  FINGER ARE YOU GONNA BAN THAT TOO
3906 2018-12-19 05:24:37 I also could not attend  someone can write which 2 stocks were & which one we bought . I have to ask Brandon or someone as I have trouble in getting recording I tried around 6 pm
3907 2018-12-19 05:23:52 I love your idea of banning members of Congress from trading in stocks. There is too much insider information that people in Congress are privy to. Also, thank you for taking the time to go to the border, to find out what is going on there. @SenJeffMerkley
3908 2018-12-19 05:23:43 We can all live without bump stocks.

3910 2018-12-19 05:23:03 And ya gotta say it. We all gotta say it at times. To hold it in is to censor the truths that help push the change we all hope for along. Today, the change was making bump stocks illegal. Something that started as despair,  hanging on hope.
3911 2018-12-19 05:22:42 So good for #Trump @realDonaldTrump for banning bump stocks. But does anyone else think it is because the NRA has decided to end funding him now they have been exposed as a Russian stooge? #NRA
3912 2018-12-19 05:22:21 How did you select these stocks?
3913 2018-12-19 05:22:12 Space stocks, mutual funds, advertisements, the space market would be tracked separately as its own industry, oh my god I want it
3914 2018-12-19 05:21:53 What is the NRA doing to protect bump stocks
3915 2018-12-19 05:21:26 The best information available says bump stocks were found in the hotel room,  but no one has said they were used!  Many, many guns,  not all used!
3916 2018-12-19 05:21:04 The administration has plenty of issues but we’re banning bump stocks and starting prison reform and that gives me some new hope
3917 2018-12-19 05:20:52 @davidhogg111 Congratulations!!!
Bump stocks will be banned starting in March!! You and Emma are my heroes! please don't stop working just because you got this one victory. That's so much more to do. And believe me I'm right behind you too!
3918 2018-12-19 05:17:58 Don't play the penny stocks.
3919 2018-12-19 05:15:32 Cant have bump stocks either i guess

3929 2018-12-19 05:11:05 Don't agree with the PE point Sir. Consumption stocks used to trade at max 25-30 when int rates were high and Nifty too traded around 11. But as rates have reduced, re-rating has taken both the indices higher and PE levels for high quality to the moon.
3930 2018-12-19 05:10:39 Straight up: 
are bump stocks the legislative hill to die on for gun rights? 
No.
BUT
Is this one of the "give us an inch and we'll take a mile" rubicons?
Yes. 
#2A
3931 2018-12-19 05:10:29 Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Today it was bump stocks and criminal justice reform. Tomorrow? Is it too much to hope for your resignation?
3932 2018-12-19 05:09:23 fact is-
bump stocks are about worthless in a firefight-
when you're running and gunning holding the darned thing just right doesn't happen-
BUT- they do not make the gun fully automatic-
so the contention they do would outlaw the Winchester pump shotguns-
which can be fanned too

3934 2018-12-19 05:08:49 It went to those at the top, who then bought back stocks. So the money went to shareholders. Who holds shares? Depends on your retirement fund. 

Your own tweet tells us they didn't keep the money. They immediately spent it, so it didn't go to those at the top.
3935 2018-12-19 05:08:11 Beautiful... just don't put one of those *scary* bump stocks on there
3936 2018-12-19 05:08:00 Ameti May go to Priyanka as Rahuls stocks r not bright there
3937 2018-12-19 05:07:55 @benshapiro you're a lawyer and your wife is a doctor. Would this fit the definition of an ex post facto law under the Constitution? Shouldn't the possession of legally purchased bump stocks been grandfathered in?
3938 2018-12-19 05:07:51 Trump is coming for your bump stocks!
3939 2018-12-19 05:07:29 सर जी,
आप दोनों जो भी stocks suggest  करेंगे उससे ये क्लियरिटी मिल जाएगी अगले five years kya चलेगा 
After that I willl buy right and sit tight 
कुछ बुरा कहा हो तो क्षमा 
3940 2018-12-19 05:07:08 Has everyone's stocks gone down? Seriously, I just put my 401k into a managed account in October out of prudency, just to see it go into literal freefall. Should I take it out of a managed account? Or is this happening to everyone?
3941 2018-12-19 05:06:49 The dropping stocks on the market is the reflection of the job market. Wait until the housing market bubble burst, then there be a bigger decline in stocks then. Fluctuation in the market always happens. But I'm waiting for the big one to hit like 1929.
3942 2018-12-19 05:06:48 The likelihood of a gun to be involved in an incident is proportional to the fire rate, so yes, bump stocks and high capacity magazines increase their likelihood and hence their use should be restricted. It is a public safety issue and a moral issue for anyone supporting them.
3943 2018-12-19 05:06:48 This world if full demons, 
Stocks and bible traitors.
3944 2018-12-19 05:06:34 Yes, that's correct. But I use the broad term because I would never touch anything related to Canadian RE now like syndicated mortgages, private lender bonds, any stocks of the companies exposed to RE etc.
3945 2018-12-19 05:05:57 Really it's a peace offering IMO, it doesn't effect anything. Bump stocks are just an accessory, an add on.
3946 2018-12-19 05:05:47 old joke in the mkt.jab tak ADAG stocks don't rally..mkt cannot top  :P
3947 2018-12-19 05:05:20 He has lost 2 billion dollars during his first two years, plus he is only taking $1/yr as salary.  When was the last time America had a billionaire as president, who is doing everything to help America.  If you have no money invested in stocks, you have no standing to complain.

3949 2018-12-19 05:04:35 I am a staunch second amendment supporter, but I think the automatic weapons prohibition is ok. I saw Philadelphia torn apart by uzzies and Mac 10s. The murder rate is half what it used to be. 
Bump stocks are a nice toy, but I don’t want the gang bangers to get them.
3950 2018-12-19 05:04:26 Earlier this year, you thought stocks were going higher in 2018 (by year-end). And in early 2016, you thought stocks were going lower in 2016 (I seem to recall--could be wrong though). What did you get wrong?  Too momentum-oriented and focused on current/trailing econ conditions?
3951 2018-12-19 05:03:56 After ordering the DOJ and ATF to reclassify bump stocks. He screwed his chances
3952 2018-12-19 05:03:53 On a day when he bans bump stocks and passes criminal justice reform. You can’t be objective on anything.

3954 2018-12-19 05:03:35 The trump administration just banned bump stocks on guns and overhauled the criminal justice system. These are two huge things that improve this country. This administration doesn’t get enough credit. Can’t wait to see CNN continue to talk about the Russia collusion story.
3955 2018-12-19 05:03:28 The big #Opioidhysteria was created to push #MedicalCannabis to treat #Pain! The states/gov are deeply involved with its advancement, big money on its stocks, gives gov much control that they seek to profile & research at the patients' expense. #Experimental!
3956 2018-12-19 05:02:50 I want the wall and don’t give a shit about bump stocks.
3957 2018-12-19 05:02:46 About bump stocks. Never heard of that till the Las Vegas massacre. But, you just can't turn an AK or M16 into a machine gun. Machine guns have continuous belts of ammo, not a a 10 or 16 round magazine. After a certain amount of rounds, the barrel will turn cherry red.
3958 2018-12-19 05:02:43 @Atulsingh_Asan now new operator in small and midcap stocks CNBC aawaz ... every day make buyer in 3 to 5 stocks during show.. SEBI make some action against ...
3959 2018-12-19 05:02:28 Agreed. But these are great stocks to directly play rising (short) as well as falling (long) oil prices thematically.
3960 2018-12-19 05:01:51 Bump stocks were a silly useless toy until someone found a way to use them. Democrats next tactic is over-reach.
3961 2018-12-19 05:01:15 Will the @ACLU be commenting on the methods utilized by @realDonaldTrump to shoehorn bump stocks into categorization under the GCA/NFA via Executive fiat or the proposed changes affect on law abiding citizens and their 2nd Amendment rights?
3962 2018-12-19 05:01:09 ...Bump Stocks should have been licensed by ATF the same way FULLY automatic weapons are. Because of the red tape and high cost very few people would have even purchased one. Why anyone would put a $100 device on a $1,000 sporting rifle to prematurely wear it out, I don't know.
3963 2018-12-19 05:00:28 mao gyd hadlok mahutdan ug stocks ahahah
3964 2018-12-19 04:59:52 And your dad ordered the ATF to reclassify bump stocks creating more criminals bye bye to the Trumps
3965 2018-12-19 04:59:46 I listened to the interview.  The relevant segment is around minutes 48-52.  He's talking about the predictive nature of price-action in 1-2 week versus 8-9 month windows, but mostly in the context of individual stocks.
3966 2018-12-19 04:59:00 Nobody else is saying it, so I will: 

Bump stocks are nothing but an inferior substitute for the full auto rifles that every American, in keeping with their God-given, unalienable rights, and our Constitution, should be able to freely keep and bear.
3967 2018-12-19 04:58:57 The reason I have a problem with the ban isn't because I like bump stocks, which as you say are basically toys.

I have a problem with it because it's both illegal and unconstitutional.
3968 2018-12-19 04:58:30 lol I hope bitcoin is at $4,000 when we wake up! Trading bitcoin is almost better than trading stocks!
3969 2018-12-19 04:58:26 @lookner I suspect Trump is banning bump stocks to inoculate himself against the gun control issue for the 2020 election. I don’t think the ban will be enforced. What are they going to do? The FBI knocks on the door of every registered gun owner?
3970 2018-12-19 04:58:24 Where’s everyone raving about trump’s ban on bump stocks? Or do we like those now that he banned them
3971 2018-12-19 04:57:57 Trump's idea: I'll throw the liberals a bone and ban bump stocks, those are stupid anyway

The result: The Second Amendment crowd is fucking pissed and the liberals are complaining anyway
3972 2018-12-19 04:57:49 There actually is such a thing as market feel: 80% of all stocks trend with the indexes and macro  news. This overpowers any single insight  you have on a single stock.  Fight the trend and you will lose.
3973 2018-12-19 04:57:21 Do you need bump stocks to accomplish any of those things? Can't some people claim they need grenades to fight government tyranny?  Where do you draw the line is the question.  Do you think machine guns should be easier to access?
3974 2018-12-19 04:57:15 यही question आपने @Stockstudy8 जी से भी किया है
5 मेरे और 5 उनके मतलब 10 stocks 10 साल के लिए
फिर अगले 10 साल तक आप क्या करेंगे
3975 2018-12-19 04:56:44 Merry Christmas, Cameron. Enjoy !!! Yes, this next year will be looking much brighter. It feels like there's been a shift from utter despair to hope that we'll soon win our democracy back. I am glad bump stocks have been banned. Its a start - long way to go !! Keep hopeful.
3976 2018-12-19 04:56:11 Bump stocks are banned, the Texas manufacture stopped production in the summer, and people will have 90 days to either destroy/overturn them or else face federal charges. This isn’t much but a slight change should be recognized.
3977 2018-12-19 04:56:03 Many Sectors & Stocks made new Highs in 2010.
Yet, the 2008 Memory is a lot more Stronger than the Massive rally after that!

Because we in general Love to Stay with Bad Memories and Consider Good as Default..

3980 2018-12-19 04:54:45 While at it, can u ask the president why he wants to make law abiding citizens felons overnight simply for owning bump stocks? 
Utterly ridiculous! We didn’t vote for him to infringe on our 2A RIGHT in ANY way. Highly disappointing. This ban is a #FirstStepAct to more bans. SAD
3981 2018-12-19 04:54:39 Here’s a bit of light Cameron-bump stocks have been banned. And those who currently own them are supposed to forfeit them.  
3982 2018-12-19 04:54:22 Curious about your take on potus signing a ban on bump stocks. Basically acting like a rino. He's supposed to be championing for the constitution not helping the left destroy it.
3983 2018-12-19 04:53:52 With Blessings of Lord Ganesha, Predicted on last Sunday in our weekly predictions about FINANCIAL sector. Today almost all stocks – Shriram Transport, Cholamandlum Investment, Bajaj Finance, LT&FH etc on fire.
3984 2018-12-19 04:53:06 Hey Greg, can you find out what IOER means? It must be some sort of banking acronym? Is it good for stocks? Maybe it’s like that I-S-D-A thing I heard them talk about in that Big Short movie?
3985 2018-12-19 04:53:06 But demanding citizens to turn in their bump stocks will create more criminals. You ducked up.

3990 2018-12-19 04:50:45 I support the 2A, NRA and @POTUS I have no issue with turning my bump stocks in. I only had them because it allowed me to fire my AR's like an automatic weapon. I will save money on ammo.
3991 2018-12-19 04:50:40 the trump administration banned bump stocks today.....I think we’re finally getting somewhere
3992 2018-12-19 04:50:40 Escorts holding and added more during downfall. thanks for sharing have a good time bhai...Auto and auto ancillaries will run due to freebees and time to accumulate Agri related stocks especially agri seeds before June as El nino effect minimising though too early to say
3993 2018-12-19 04:50:38 2 technology stocks slipped on Tuesday:

3994 2018-12-19 04:50:31 @Neha_trade mam
Can you please suggest few stocks in which we can invest like sip

3995 2018-12-19 04:49:55 English players are like uncertain stocks. The probability of them not showing up for the tournament is higher than they completing even one season. No wonder there are no takers.
3996 2018-12-19 04:49:15 "Trump signs order banning bump stocks"
3997 2018-12-19 04:48:16 Do you even know what bump stocks are? Doubt.
3998 2018-12-19 04:48:12 Anyone have any bump stocks they’d be willing to sell? #BumpStockBan #MolonLabe #SecondAmendment
3999 2018-12-19 04:47:49 Hey, this could be classic 4d chess. Trump bans #bumpstocks to appease the left, the libertarians sue  to overturn it, they win, Trump shrugs, "Sorry libs, I tried." We get  our gay bump stocks back and the libs think they won something.  Everybody wins. #MAGAveteran
4000 2018-12-19 04:47:47 How about the fact that Congress, the Senate, & @realDonaldTrump have made bump stocks illegal? Those who possess them will have 90 days to turn them in, before they’re reported to the @ATFHQ. Still like Trump? LOL  #GunControlNow #NRAisaterroristOrganization #stopgunviolence
4001 2018-12-19 04:46:56 Waiting for the "Real Conservative" to explain why "lolbertarians" got it wrong with Bump Stocks and why it's actually good for the economy. #MAGA Something something #Koch something #globalism.
4002 2018-12-19 04:46:29 Govt is creating a feel good factor with large dole outs.
Short term gains with larger long term pains.
This could move Corporate banks,Pvt banks , Nbfc higher from these levels .
Consumer stocks will do well with money in hands of voters.
Nifty could  move to 11400 by Jan middle
4003 2018-12-19 04:46:23 I got to stop looking at my stocks...They just keep falling :(
4004 2018-12-19 04:46:21 Bump stocks should not never been made legal during the Obama administration to turn semi auto to basically fully automatic. There is a reason why you need a special license to own fully automatic weapons. Keeps most out of nut jobs and criminals.
4005 2018-12-19 04:45:29 acabei de jogar 9 partidas com a mesma pessoa no Smash, 7 dessas 9 usaram as regras que o cara escolheu. Puta que pariu esses macacos jogando com 2 stocks
4006 2018-12-19 04:45:28 That story line is BS. I heard a second gun that was a belt feed 308. Much more than was media told us. Bump stocks are stupid and serves no point with no accuracy. Obama pass them as legal.
4007 2018-12-19 04:44:57 So if I own bump stocks, and I am a non violent offender and have a clean criminal back ground, I'll have a reduced sentence due to the "prison reform act"

Right?

No. I'd be in jail for longer then a drug dealer who potentially murdered someone unintentionally
4008 2018-12-19 04:44:18 Bad  news is, jails will be emptied of tens of thousands of criminals.
Good news is, this opens up new space in jail now for 500000k Law abiding who own bump stocks which will now be considered machine guns by Trump. Semiautomatic firearms to follow.
4009 2018-12-19 04:44:11 @lookner - I suspect Trump is banning bump stocks to inoculate himself against the gun control issue for the 2020 election. I don’t think the ban will be enforced. What are they going to do? The FBI knocks on the door of every registered gun owner?
4010 2018-12-19 04:44:02 United States of put your money on tech stocks and wait for the quarterly reports.
4011 2018-12-19 04:43:07 Just hand over the bump stocks like a good slave.
Don't you WANT to be a slave?
4012 2018-12-19 04:42:43 Bump stocks are crude plastic devices easily made with a 3d printer or even simple tools. Remember what happened when they banned alcohol and cannabis? This will most likely cause more harm than good and put the lives police officers just doing their job at risk.
4013 2018-12-19 04:42:31 Very disappointed in President Trump banning bump stocks today what’s next? AR-15? .22’s? BB guns? It’s just a matter of time.
4014 2018-12-19 04:42:24 I think he thought it meant his “stocks” were actually getting a bump. But it’s a big win & I’m stoked he’s too concerned with his “wall”. Actually wait... 4 walls suit him. 
4015 2018-12-19 04:42:23 @GroverNorquist
@JeromeAdamsMD 

Among the 150 or so stocks he lists are Philip Morris International, Altria (formerly known as Philip Morris Companies), Reynolds American, British American Tobacco, and Imperial Brands (the world’s fourth-largest tobacco corporation
4016 2018-12-19 04:42:22 You do realise that's kind of what stocks do irs actually worse if they just kept going up and up they have to fall down then rise again
4017 2018-12-19 04:42:09 When it comes to bump stocks, it's important to ask: what purpose do they serve?
Can they be used in hunting? No.
Are they good for home defense? No.
Are they good for self defense out of home? No.
They literally only have one purpose - to make a gun shoot fast, less accurate.
4018 2018-12-19 04:41:56 ATF itself said it could NOT legally ban bump stocks unless Congress changed the laws.

Congress has not changed the laws.

So no. It's likely not "law" at all.

The President does not make laws.
4019 2018-12-19 04:41:55 People like @RayDalio & George Soros didnt become billionaires by helping mom & pop cab drivers and bakers..when they tell you "get rid of your cash, cash is worst thing ever," go all in stocks or you'll look like an idiot in 10th year of bull market..you know to GTFO of market.

4021 2018-12-19 04:41:23 Great - Nestle. P&G. ITC. IMO, these stocks can be held in the portfolio forever. Steady returns. Quality acts as best defence also in bad times.
4022 2018-12-19 04:41:12 Today was a good day for America...First Step Gun Reform. Banning Bump Stocks First Step Justice Reform. FirstStepAct ..No Shutdown No Wall... Maybe A Picket Fence. Overall one good day.
4023 2018-12-19 04:41:05 @POTUS. You're caving to the hysterical left.  Banning bump stocks is not a smart move.  Careful about going against gun owners, you won't fair well in 2020. #2ndAmendment #ShallNotBeInfringed #MolanLabe
4024 2018-12-19 04:40:35 The banning of bump stocks a good thing. Arming school staff is not a good thing. There are so many potential fatal concerns. Plus, what is the liability cost in $ for doing this? Who pays for this cost & cost to ensure appropriate training & continued testing of capability?
4025 2018-12-19 04:40:31 Wall Street bitching that stocks are now lower than when Trump signed his tax reform bill. That’s cuz tax reform was a windfall to corporate America & they used it to buy back stock not grow their businesses. It was another funneling of wealth to the top w/o any lasting value.
4026 2018-12-19 04:40:18 Why do some people go online with two stocks as if For Glory isn’t dead in the ground
4027 2018-12-19 04:40:14 Is it a law?

First, it incorrectly describes how bump stocks actually work. It doesn't set off a chain reaction "initiated by one pull of the trigger". On the contrary, they create a situation in which the trigger is pulled repeatedly.

One pull, one shot.
4028 2018-12-19 04:40:04 1) Investment universe is vast. No point in trying to catch all the fishes. Stick to circle of competence.
2) Prices can still come down. No need to jump the fence.
3) Just hold the quality stocks and hope no corporate governance issues pop up.
4029 2018-12-19 04:39:54 Bump stocks. Bump stocks were banned. Try to keep up there, skippy.
4030 2018-12-19 04:39:51 The ATF verified multiple times (under Obama) that the possession. sale, and/or use of Bump stocks does not violate any laws passed by Congress (the only people who can make or change laws).
4031 2018-12-19 04:39:46 I totally get that, but please for everything I have learned in MBA finance classes and my own research, don’t sell now. Your stocks will bounce back
4032 2018-12-19 04:39:41 President is banning bump stocks, gun girl hardest hit
4033 2018-12-19 04:39:29 @realDonaldTrump I don't like bump stocks, but you making them criminal will make me think twice about supporting you again.  I'm 2nd Amendment all the way and you're handing them a new way to erode it.  Mr. President, don't make law abiding people criminals like this.
4034 2018-12-19 04:39:25 And now Pittsburg want to ban the AR15 and guns with folding or extendable stocks.

Who does an extendable stock make a gun more scary?
4035 2018-12-19 04:39:21 Why do salty players who teabag do it when they are behind stocks? They barely take 1 stock from me and start teabagging like crazy and I end up bodying them after lol
4036 2018-12-19 04:39:11 My heart breaks over Vegas but this is pointless. Bump stocks probably prevented more shots from hitting their targets in Vegas because there use makes shooters far less accurate and shots more erratic. This is cheap political lip service by a politician desperate for a win.
4037 2018-12-19 04:38:58 Have you tried Darling? I think it tastes way better, and it’s hormone-free. Checkers stocks it, and maybe Spar too.
4038 2018-12-19 04:38:57 To be clear, I think you may be thinking it's all or nothing.  We can move on multiple fronts at once.  Banning bump stocks doesn't mean that gun control can't later improve.
4039 2018-12-19 04:38:56 I am a conservative, pro 2A but bump stocks are unnecessary... it’s obvious there needs to be a change and this is a start
4040 2018-12-19 04:38:42 I believe in grinding & doing work by myself,
rely very less on others.
I have all the data for all the stocks & indices in Excel Format.
4041 2018-12-19 04:38:38 bump stocks.
4042 2018-12-19 04:38:24 Millions of people already have bump stocks so the rule is really a waste lol. Good try tho. 2nd amendment supporter. Laws dont stop crime.
4043 2018-12-19 04:37:34 Re: the Las Vegas shooter, buddy of mine researched what he spent on firearms: "Over $51K when you add in bump stocks, EOTechs, and 100 round magazines." Thank God he was a horrible shot/untrained SOB.
4044 2018-12-19 04:37:26 In my long list of complaints about smash's online matchmaking (and trust me, it's a long list) the one that's most confusing to me is why does self destructing take away 2 stocks?I already feel great shame that I just Side-Bed my way to my death, do I need more punishment?
4045 2018-12-19 04:37:21 I have to be honest. I support the Second Amendment, but bump stocks were unpredictable and dangerous even to the safety concious on a range, you can pull your finger fast enough and it's reliable, and your rifle won't jam as much.
4046 2018-12-19 04:37:18 So excited to give myself stocks up baybayyyyyyyyy
4047 2018-12-19 04:37:17 Rally over in PSU stocks..... Sell Bank of India Futures at 94.50 for a  of 90..... Sell Bajaj Finserve....

4049 2018-12-19 04:37:06 Why people need Bump Stocks?
4050 2018-12-19 04:37:05 Bump stocks declared automatic weapons - yeah, have to appreciate something.
4051 2018-12-19 04:36:54 “Stocks up to Hazmatt getting 3rd at GU.”
4052 2018-12-19 04:36:13 The @NRA was gung-ho as hell about banning bump stocks a year ago. Why are they suddenly wringing their hands now that they've gotten their way?

Smells like they're trying to play politics and sit on both sides of the fence.
4053 2018-12-19 04:36:02 Who tf chooses bump stocks over binary triggers anyway 
4054 2018-12-19 04:35:51 Is a gd 1st step but know that many of the mass shootings didn't involve Bump Stocks. Does this ban include future sales or ones already bought? Please investigate and report. Thanks.
4055 2018-12-19 04:35:30 It’s only bump stocks, which turn ar’s into machine guns, which are illegal to own.
4056 2018-12-19 04:35:03 My friend is looking for a ABV3 seller here in PH, anyone knows who still have stocks available? #LoveYourself #BTSLYTOUR @BTS_twt
4057 2018-12-19 04:34:42 I don't see the need for bump stocks....educate me....if revolution becomes a reality...bump stock won't help. No fire discipline  wastes ammo...
4058 2018-12-19 04:34:19 Have bump stocks ever been used in the commission of a crime?  Slippery slope!  Gun control move!
4059 2018-12-19 04:34:04 It’s not full auto u turd lol l. literally they are attachments. You have to take off the stock and screw the bump stocks into the pistol grip area lol.  Bump stocks are trash anyway, but this law won’t do shit since anyone can do the same thing using their belt loops.
4060 2018-12-19 04:33:56 Relax.  Life will go on fine without bump stocks.  Pick your battles
4061 2018-12-19 04:33:45 Why? When dems have gotten a lot of what they wanted.
Including more #2A infringement.
The govt has nukes +,  yet they take away bump stocks??
@realDonaldTrump 
"Shall Not Be Infringed."
4062 2018-12-19 04:33:37 ED I am said: American People look around the world is in a recession the America economy is doing great, best in American history? Trump will you own it! Now stocks fall like rock a perfect storm recession  date 4-4-18 & 4-8-18 he said!!!
4063 2018-12-19 04:33:36 Let’s hear it for banning bump stocks and the criminal justice reform bill.  Finally some positive political news that everyone can cheer.
4064 2018-12-19 04:33:19 Would you not agree that the fees are somewhat justified in the sense that holding custody of crypto assets is risker and a more difficult task than centralised fin.products like stocks?
4065 2018-12-19 04:33:08 his administration moving to ban bump stocks and making a motion to ban 30 round magazines in the future. after his whole campaign said it was “ending the war on guns” for conservatives
4066 2018-12-19 04:33:01 In central Chile I was led to dry stems and branches of life, in comparison with the wild stocks of any kind is possible.
4067 2018-12-19 04:32:59 @realDonaldTrump This is YOUR legacy as of today: Banned bump stocks (i.e., anti 2nd amendment rights) and reformed prisons. ALL DEM WINS. WOW.
4068 2018-12-19 04:32:48 ya nbfc stocks r looking good weeklt buy on many,technology looking weak.but auto numbers on dec will decide the fate i feel
4069 2018-12-19 04:32:19 It doesn't matter if they are useful or useless we still shouldn't okay with it and besides the anti gunners aren't going to stop at bump stocks just go to Firearm Policy Coalition or Guns & Gadgets YouTube Channel for more info
4070 2018-12-19 04:30:49 Short cereal stocks
4071 2018-12-19 04:30:25 The stock market is a leading indicator and unemployment a lagging indicator. So stock returns are negative at the beginning of recessions when unemployment is lowest, and stocks rebound before unemployment starts to fall.
4072 2018-12-19 04:30:05 And the President just had ATF issue regulations which will make felons out of 500000k people who own bump stocks and never committed a crime.  Guess you made room.  And the president who just backed down on the wall promise.  For first time, reconsidering my support for Trump.
4073 2018-12-19 04:30:03 Stocks in the news: Dr Reddy's Labs, NTPC, Fortis Health, J Kumar Infra, Welspun Enterprises and Piramal Enterprises are stocks which are in the news today.

4075 2018-12-19 04:29:21 Little by little we’ve given up our rights and become more dependent on government. Banning bump stocks won’t solve the problem. The problem is hate, greed, fear, and laziness.
4076 2018-12-19 04:28:40 Many interest rate sensitive stocks are forming extremely positive technical patterns. 
However, need to be cautious for one more day. Let the FED Meeting pass.
4077 2018-12-19 04:28:21 Nobody that knows anything about guns cares about bump stocks. It’s the fact that people think banning a gimmicky device is going to make them safe while psychopaths are free to continue coming up with new ways to hurt people so they can get their faces on TV
4078 2018-12-19 04:27:54 Losing money on biotech stocks pretty much happens by itself. Leaves me with a lot of free time. I follow Tesla/Elon pretty close as I feel like it's a pretty sweet short once the time is right. Which it ain't yet.
4079 2018-12-19 04:27:17 Idc about bump stocks that’s the beginning I care about protecting myself and my children as a single mom if someone breaks into our home. This is only a test the beginning. Look at history, unarmed citizens are an easy target. Look at Venezuela. Look at Germany.
4080 2018-12-19 04:26:45 Stocks are having the worst December since the Great Depression.
4081 2018-12-19 04:26:27 I'm glad the president is banning bump stocks because the stock market is really bad right now.
4082 2018-12-19 04:26:19 Let's see - trade war? Check. Moral relativism? Check. Abandoning US leadership role in the world? Check. Complete absence of the moral guidelines? Check. Big government unfunded spending? Check. Retroactively prohibiting bump stocks? Check. Conservative you say...
4083 2018-12-19 04:26:02 he misread it as Trump Stocks...
4084 2018-12-19 04:24:41 @realDonaldTrump To confiscate Bump Stocks is a clear Violation of the 5th Amendment!!
4085 2018-12-19 04:24:08 You are 100% right, it isn’t just stocks there are so many ways to make money as a creator with an audience. Honestly I could go on and on about this but that wouldn’t fit in a tweet. But you seem like a pretty smart guy and I could definitely chat privately with you about this
4086 2018-12-19 04:23:38 My daughter and I marched in the March for our Lives event. They talked about bump stocks as being the big issue. It awesome to see change as a result of those kids voices.
4087 2018-12-19 04:22:29 The Jensen and Dylon Joint co. We do stocks. We also make joints.
4088 2018-12-19 04:22:28 Does it even matter now? Trump out in 2 years with the cave on the Wall and the confiscation of bump stocks....Confiscation!
4089 2018-12-19 04:22:07 @realDonaldTrump Bump Stocks, Ok under the Obama Administration 
BANNED UNDER THE TRUMP Administration.

It's not the stock. It's a principle, ATF does not write Law. What's next my rifle??

Mr. President I might not Vote for you in 2020.
4090 2018-12-19 04:21:42 Tf is making bump stocks illegal gonna do 
4091 2018-12-19 04:21:40 The ban on bump stocks is BS! I don't own any but there doesn't need to be a ban on bump stocks
4092 2018-12-19 04:21:33 Early trade Update (19 Dec):- Domestic stocks drifted higher in early trade, extending their prior six-day rising trend. Sensex up 100 and Nifty up 39 points at 10,947. Mid-Cap up 0.69%. Small-Cap up 0.57%. Both these indices outperformed the Sensex.
4093 2018-12-19 04:21:22 When you value bump stocks over human life...
4094 2018-12-19 04:21:22 Hell, the @NRA were the ones who started the push to ban bump-fire stocks.
4095 2018-12-19 04:21:21 For a rare change, I'm proud of the Trump administration for doing the right thing: banning bump stocks and ordering the destruction of all of them.
4096 2018-12-19 04:21:07 out of senior gold mining stocks today--only juniors which will sell in next 2 days unless stops QT tomorrow which would unleash pm/miners prematurely. still think he is dovish rate hikes but wont touch QT---cant figure the dude out
4097 2018-12-19 04:20:49 Let’s not gloss over the great news: the Trump admin. has banned bump stocks for guns! Major victory.
4098 2018-12-19 04:20:23 What is my president thinking today?? You ban bump stocks for law abiding citizens but you are going to allow criminals an easy way out. I do not feel good about the road being traveled.
4099 2018-12-19 04:20:15 I don’t say this often, but the Trump administration did well today. Banned bump stocks, prision reform passed in senate, AND they gave in on border wall funding
4100 2018-12-19 04:20:07 Hi. I didnt see any. To be honest the stocks are very limited as they are only pop out shop. But maybe can order.. but not sure
4101 2018-12-19 04:19:52 If he bans bumpfire stocks, that will be a black mark against him.
4102 2018-12-19 04:19:42 @realDonaldTrump Love ya man. But supporting a ban of anything firearms? Law abiding gun owners keep giving in small steps but never get anything back.

How about banning bump stocks and allowing silencers to be bought over the counter. Or short barrel rifles.

Negotiate man...
4103 2018-12-19 04:19:40 Ok since you the plug, I need you to guide me through buying stocks on this.

4109 2018-12-19 04:18:45 Get rid of the @NRA and ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines, ban AR-15 and the like, more background checks, require a license  (with a safety and use course eg. driving), etc.

4113 2018-12-19 04:17:54 Yeah it sucks...

I'm willing to learn more about things like stocks, you know? Expanding your knowledge is a very very important thing if someone wants to get through in this life.
4114 2018-12-19 04:17:46 I mean the libs will always be after our guns, and we will always find a way around their petty bullshit. Bump stocks aren't really a "victory" for the left. More like a participation trophy that we give all morons for trying.
4115 2018-12-19 04:17:13 He just pulled a nasty on the 2A . Approving changes in the language of the definition of Full-auto to encompass bump stocks.This opens the door for left to abuse in the future .The GOA has filed suit.Trump’s stock just fell big time with me .
4116 2018-12-19 04:16:06 Similarly, around '97/'98 when I was in 8th grade, I recall sitting at the family computer when my dad walked in & asked me what internet stocks to buy. I was too much of a computer geek to care about stocks at the time & had no clue. He ended up buying tech mutual funds 
4117 2018-12-19 04:16:03 Nice stocks no doubt
4118 2018-12-19 04:15:52 If the president signs a bill on these bump stocks for the AR-15 he can better bet that he will lose in 2020.
4119 2018-12-19 04:15:38 These are the 1 stocks in technology sector that yesterday made all-time highs:
$MTLS
4120 2018-12-19 04:15:18 Tariffs and trade wars are the problem.  The Fed is just doing their job.  Keeping inflation in check is the only way to keep any gains in wages meaningful.  The stock market isn’t the economy.  Only 52% own stocks. The stock market is reacting to global instability in trade.
4121 2018-12-19 04:15:18 There are plenty of ways to simulate what bump stocks do that they can't outlaw. This whole thing is just dumb.
4122 2018-12-19 04:15:17 So Kushner was working with Van Jones to get the First Step Act passed, and we learn this on the same day that Trump banned bump stocks. Sounds to me like Trump is turning on his base in hopes of building a bigger base.
4123 2018-12-19 04:15:16 Yea, I knew the Twitter stuff would only hurt him. I don’t care about bump stocks but the fact that there is no grandfathering in is very concerning
4124 2018-12-19 04:15:12 Today was epic in national news...bump stocks banned, Trump foundation disbanded, Flynn admitted to the judge that he lied. But I want to fast forward to the part where order is restored.
4125 2018-12-19 04:14:35 Does anybody really like bump stocks? They couldn’t give that gimmicky shit away and now thanks to the Democrats people are buying them as fast as they can make them
4126 2018-12-19 04:14:08 All those Dems and NeoCons that are invested in prison industry stocks will not be happy!  It's definitely a step in the right direction.
4127 2018-12-19 04:14:06 obama and you democrats legalized bump stocks. president trump has been saying he willl ban them; he just did. you lose.
4128 2018-12-19 04:14:05 Good thing I sold all of my bump stocks last week 
4129 2018-12-19 04:13:52 Hey @NRA -you’re upset people have to turn in or destroy their bump stocks? Geez-give one good reason a citizen needs one and don’t hide behind the second amendment
4130 2018-12-19 04:13:41 @realDonaldTrump   NO! shoot yourself in the foot. NO!  @NRA 
The Trump administration moved Tuesday to officially ban bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms, and has made them illegal to possess beginning in late March.
4131 2018-12-19 04:13:40 Bump stocks are a technological and legal hack to get around a consensus against full automatics
If they want to argue for full auto, they should do so openly and honestly
4132 2018-12-19 04:13:39 Don't use Concrete... use all those banned Bump Stocks... Polymers are the future
4133 2018-12-19 04:13:26 Sold 2 Lots DLF Futures at 184....Sell all Realty stocks...

4136 2018-12-19 04:12:44 I voted for Trump & getting thousands of foreign workers dumped here. Getting my 2nd amendment rights trampled with confiscation of bump stocks & who knows what else.
4137 2018-12-19 04:12:42 The bump stocks rule is good, but people were given months and months to buy them before they were outlawed. The time lag took the bite out of the rule.
4138 2018-12-19 04:11:54 Ms. @Ocasio2018 
A person PURCHASES STOCKS.

A gift card is a gift.  If you purchase your own gift card, be sure to keep the RECEIPT.
AND DON'T ACCEPT any GIFTS of STOCKS!
4139 2018-12-19 04:11:50 president trump just banned bump stocks today: the same bump stocks obama made legal.  you are a joke.
4140 2018-12-19 04:11:46 So let's say I have a stock pile of "bump stocks", which I don't.

Let's say time passes and I get caught and sentenced to prison.

Is this criminal reform bill going to take that into consideration, even though I was a non violent offender?
4141 2018-12-19 04:11:41 How many people lost their bump stocks in a freak snowmobiling accident today?
4142 2018-12-19 04:11:32 It's about time someone put a stop to bureaucratic organizations run by unelected people establishing law in this country.That power according to The Constitution resides solely in the hands of Congress. I could care less about bump stocks but I care deeply about The Constitution
4143 2018-12-19 04:11:15 @MollyGrantham The bump stocks are a fabrication with respect to Las Vegas.  The gunfire was not AR-15 - it was a heavier, sustained fire - far beyond what the capabilities are.  The pics of the room did not show thousands of cartridges that would have been there.  Govt doth lie.
4144 2018-12-19 04:11:14 Gee, the Market is near the worst since the Great Depression. Think Trumpsters will turn on him?  Nope, but I bet they will since they just lost their Bump Stocks!
4145 2018-12-19 04:11:11 The poor don't have stocks.
4146 2018-12-19 04:11:09 it is moving with small crap stocks
4147 2018-12-19 04:10:47 If bump stocks aren’t worth anything why not give them up? Give them the screws and take the car.
4148 2018-12-19 04:10:42 It's a terrible shame though, about the terrible fishing accident where all those bump stocks were lost. Tragedy.
4149 2018-12-19 04:10:37 I commend the Trump administration for finally doing something meaningful and justifiable in their ban of bump stocks. This is ultimately a minor step towards our major goal of making our country as safe as it can be from a domestic standpoint.

#TuesdayThoughts
4150 2018-12-19 04:10:29 imagine thinking banning bump stocks is actually going to have even a remotely positive effect

like on anything. its not gonna do anything lol
4151 2018-12-19 04:10:10 So glad that I am beginning to understand penny stocks. Only because I have been studying @timothysykes challenge! This morning 60k $KALY at 0.015 out at 0.0164 for 9.3% profit!
4152 2018-12-19 04:09:40 It's a company companies need to keep making money so their stocks don't go down in price
4153 2018-12-19 04:09:35 need to hop on these stocks
4154 2018-12-19 04:09:19 @realDonaldTrump NEVER give the Deep State the legal right to CONFISCATE Anything !
This just set a legal precedent!
The Deep State will go far beyond bump stocks !
I GUARANTEE guns are next !
You need to revisit this thing and take the confiscation order out ASAP !
4155 2018-12-19 04:09:06 Shy away. you asked the question of MJ-12 stating he took our guns away, as far as I know it was something about bump stocks. remember I know nothing about guns. This law, which is certainly not in effect, is not taking guns away. Again, disarming will be necessary for #Contact
4156 2018-12-19 04:08:52 People on this thread: IMMIGRATION LAWS MUST BE OBEYED!

Also people on this thread: Those pigs will never take my bump stocks!
4157 2018-12-19 04:08:35 Sean you're entitled to your opinion bump stocks are pretty much useless. The facts are Congress and these idiots in DC know nothing about weapons. There are other better-performing platforms out there but I'm not going to name them.
4158 2018-12-19 04:08:30 guys the trump administration banned bump stocks that goes into effect in march so i wanna see people talking about this
4159 2018-12-19 04:08:12 Hedge funds showing signs of caution towards US equities Fund managers are reducing their exposure despite falling valuations making stocks look cheap
4160 2018-12-19 04:07:58 Thanks. I figured it must be middle of the night home protection. BTW, I recognize several of the frames/stocks but what's the one that is clearly a military design... kind of a hybrid pistol and rifle?
4161 2018-12-19 04:07:55 I hope Trump keeps diverting attention from his impending impeachment by banning bump stocks and starts offering affordable healthcare and supporting raises taxes on the 1%...
4162 2018-12-19 04:06:16 Lol was that you? I haven’t even gotten it out yet but I’m already excited about making stocks and broths in it, or pho, in addition to crawfish and shrimp boils
4163 2018-12-19 04:06:15 The ban on bump stocks has language which means it can be adapted to ban semi autos. Anything that increases the fire rate (magazines included).

The GOP holds the senate and presidency. There was no meed to EO this. Gun control is the most losing issue in America.
4164 2018-12-19 04:05:47 Hmm, who do you want to win?
The person who supports banning bump stocks
or the person who will ban guns altogether...
hmm...a puzzle...

What a moron.
Who's he going to vote for? Gary Johnson?
haha
4165 2018-12-19 04:05:16 Look.....the original conversation I  was trying to have was about the accuracy of bump stocks and how they are not accurate at all.
 Grenades, automatic weapons, and nukes, were not part of the topic.
4166 2018-12-19 04:05:16 No secret to it. Buy low, sell high and research. Don’t get greedy, stick it out when the stocks down.
4167 2018-12-19 04:05:14 @realDonaldTrump if you are going to have the ATF ban bump stocks i think you should have them free up suppressors so their is no wait just like buying a fire arm

4169 2018-12-19 04:04:06 For sure, many oversold stocks. I don’t see the hedging and cash on the sidelines though. I don’t think anyone truly believes this thing could get to a 50 VIX and that it will instead rebound. Rates and liquidity are very different from past 10 years of dips to buy
4170 2018-12-19 04:04:01 Stocks on track for worst December since Great Depression... Don Lemon CNN. So Trump has taken a steadily growing economy inherited from Obama and trashed it with his antics.
4171 2018-12-19 04:03:50 Might be as no one can we 100% sure but this time market isn't oversold like it was in late 2008. Not seeing stocks trading at 300+ P/E  which was very common in Sep 2008. Further watchdogs are more active now and hence less chance of bad apples like Sataym and Educomp.
4172 2018-12-19 04:03:04 Bump stocks and yellow vests for everyone on my Christmas list this year  
4173 2018-12-19 04:02:57 He banned bump stocks today smarty pants.
4174 2018-12-19 04:02:53 Totally! And what's up with them taking our bump-stocks! Other gun-owners I've talked to seem to be rolling over like there's nothing we cam do to prevent it, so we should just let it happen! This is 2nd amendment infringement!
4175 2018-12-19 04:02:45 As the dept grows so will inflation, which I think may pick up next year which is good for stocks and commodities depending on how you look at it or which side of the aisle you’re on
4176 2018-12-19 04:02:31 The stocks are siding bad because you voted in Democrats.
4177 2018-12-19 04:02:15 All I want for Christmas is to win the lottery so I can spend it all on plastic surgery and pot stocks
4178 2018-12-19 04:02:14 Some Americans fear what the Trump Administration’s ban on bump stocks will mean in the future for gun rights. Stories on @WestwoodOne stations.
4179 2018-12-19 04:01:31 If he fails on the boarder wall he’s done. I do support the criminal justice overhaul.  25 years is still a plenty long sentence.  Ban bump stocks not sure about
4180 2018-12-19 04:01:02 The MAGAts are PISSED off at Trump! They still don't have their wall, and a ban on bump stocks. You should hear the outrage.  It's  hysterical! That's what the idiots get for voting for a idiot liar! 
4181 2018-12-19 04:00:20 You keep arguing this, but you know full well that if someone fires 400 rounds at you vs 15/21, that this results in large number of . There's a reason Las Vegas shooter used rifles with bump stocks vs handgun, including range sheer number of rounds and speed.

4184 2018-12-19 03:59:27 @KellyannePolls Prez bans Bump stocks after vowing in 2016 to not infringe on 2nd amendment. Next Dem Prez could ban AR 15 or some other guns as he/she pleases. Why doesn't he ban birthright citizenship instead ?
4185 2018-12-19 03:59:24 @KaitMarieox what did you tweet earlier about your bump stocks?
4186 2018-12-19 03:59:14 Sorry if I sound like a nut-job, but ATF's little stunt today disturbs me to no end-- and, as a proud gun-owner (I BUILT my own ar-15), I thought bump stocks were a dumb idea!
4187 2018-12-19 03:59:09 I mean, I've heard of one issue voters. But bump stocks is the hill they're choosing? Unbelievable.
4188 2018-12-19 03:59:00 They’re banning bump stocks, not guns lmao
4189 2018-12-19 03:58:49 Red flag law, unconstitutional

Bump stocks, boogie man

Waiting period, joke

STOP ATTACHING THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND LAW ABIDING CITIZENS YOU TOOL
4190 2018-12-19 03:58:28 I love how even when he does exactly what you want, it's still not good enough. 
Bump stocks scare the hell out of me. I am glad to see them go.
4191 2018-12-19 03:57:58 You are a rich man. Buy some stocks.
4192 2018-12-19 03:57:50 Yes, thats why the tweet. Would be a good buying opp as premium gets price gets knocked down some as stocks rise.
4193 2018-12-19 03:57:36 The Nasdaq leads in bull markets so why does everyone think stocks are gonna crash? The spread looks very bullish still, or is just the anti-trumpers who want Trump to have a bear market? Seems like the latter plus the typical doomsayers.
4194 2018-12-19 03:57:36 I've been seeing people swear off Trump all day over fucking bump stocks. Who cares? You can just make your own if it means that much.
4195 2018-12-19 03:57:30 Bump stocks banned today, by a “pro-gun” administration as the NRA is silent.  What’s next?  Belt loops or stiff fingers? Reactionary governance is the work of either fools or tyrants.  Which is @realDonaldTrump? #2a #bumpstocks #fool
4196 2018-12-19 03:57:22 Toronto Star stocks are down,pretty soon they will need a Liberal handout.
4197 2018-12-19 03:56:53 Ok, let's see: the NRA is implicated in accepting money from and conspiring with Russians. Today the Trump administration is applauded for banning bump stocks, distancing itself from the NRA. 

You really giving this man a hand?
4198 2018-12-19 03:56:46 Bump stocks for guns were made federally illegal today, this is a great step towards further gun regulations. Hopefully we can get follow up legislation to further regulate the gun market.
4199 2018-12-19 03:56:37 If the Fed notes read dovish tonight and Trump gets his wish, gold could really start to take off into 2019. Gold stocks are truly an underappreciated opportunity today. We're not close to a bull market by any means, however a sharp rally to the upside looks highly probable.
4200 2018-12-19 03:54:36 Bump stocks are overrated anyway
4201 2018-12-19 03:54:16 Well, since you took away bump stocks, I can defend my family less.   Thank God the pedo, satanic gov. will be there.  #disappointed #WWG1WGA
4202 2018-12-19 03:54:01 Please look at the second amendment.  Eliminating bump stocks is infringing.  Get rid of burdensome regulation against the second amendment and get ready to veto Red Flag legislation!  A free society comes with risk!  @realDonaldTrump
4203 2018-12-19 03:53:53 I thought you libs didn't want bump stocks, it gets banned and you still complain
4204 2018-12-19 03:53:52 Yes, they did state he used bump stocks.
4205 2018-12-19 03:53:40 They wouldn't ban bump stocks unless the NRA Gave permission. Because they have a plan to get around it.
Too many rubles changed hands!
4206 2018-12-19 03:53:38 As long as he doesn’t give up anything more than bump stocks

4210 2018-12-19 03:52:31 @scrowder @LWCnewswire Any comment on @realDonaldTrump approving a ban on Bump Stocks?
4211 2018-12-19 03:51:43 It's criminal, or should be, to manipulate stocks like this.
4212 2018-12-19 03:51:17 Bump stocks are not protected by 2A!
4213 2018-12-19 03:50:48 I thought they maximize money, power & ego. US establishment wildly applauds these guys, starting ~ 20 yrs. ago 'You've got to buy these stocks' thru 'China, our soon to be partner in democracy.'
4214 2018-12-19 03:50:41 Bump stocks are not protected under 2A
4215 2018-12-19 03:50:34 I love when everyone in crypto is slowly switching to stocks after us....... 
4216 2018-12-19 03:50:33 .@rudepundit the ATF already said that only a congressional intervention would stop bump stocks. There's nothing to be done without Congressional intervention here.
4217 2018-12-19 03:50:26 @P_diwan hello Prakash Sir, where can I get your suggestions on good investment stocks. I tried search for your researchers but couldn't find anywhere, can you guide me sir.

4222 2018-12-19 03:48:42 I am a hard core 2A person i don't like  any thing being banned at all . But when it come's to bump stocks they are a waste time and money
4223 2018-12-19 03:48:36 And bump stocks
4224 2018-12-19 03:48:20 @realDonaldTrump please look at the second amendment.  Eliminating bump stocks is infringing.  Get rid of burdensome regulation against the second amendment and get ready to veto Red Flag legislation!  A free society comes with risk!
4225 2018-12-19 03:48:08 ATF considered bump stocks legal up until Trump's EO making it a crime to possess, sell or manufacture them.
4226 2018-12-19 03:48:04 He’s literally a private man with a provate company I’m not giving him any money cause I don’t have stocks so if he wants to try and make the world a better place it’s better than doing nothing

Monsters in the making January will blow some damn minds as end of tax season looms here along with this long overdue big board correction, time for some of those funds to flow into penny stocks!
4228 2018-12-19 03:47:41 Most funds are partially in stocks. None should be primarily in stocks.
4229 2018-12-19 03:46:58 If you’re dedicated to do the right thing, then enlighten me. Today, Trump charity was shut down for falsely misusing for personal & political purposes. I have seen him lie numerous times. Stocks are WAY down. He doesn’t believe in global warming. Wall won’t work. Why????
4230 2018-12-19 03:46:52 I lost all of my bump stocks on the deep web for a 1500% markup. 
4231 2018-12-19 03:46:44 I have no use for bump stocks nor do i like them but they are a second amendment right to united states of America citizens and the fact that they are banned has me worried. NJ just passed a mag ban as well. Then i remember if the government keeps banning things for our guns
4232 2018-12-19 03:46:42 If he wasnt party to the deep state, why would he ban bump stocks? It is something only the deep state wants.
4233 2018-12-19 03:46:34 Bump stocks are for guys to pretend they have a machine gun, they're useless. We need to becareful about messing with the Constitution. We have laws on the books about firearms, they have to be enforced, especially the gun community. Mental health issues need to be addressed.
4234 2018-12-19 03:46:10 Are they going to bump all the stocks away then Walter?!? Then if we don’t have anymore stock we will have another crash just like in 29!,,, the liberals want to start another depression! Call the secret service! Call Hannity

4238 2018-12-19 03:44:58 I usually agree w u but not today. Who cares about bump stocks. No one is losing their guns. He did not cave he’s getting no support, blame Congress. They suck! His criminal justice reform will not release VIOLANT criminals petty criminals will get a 2nd chance. As they should
4239 2018-12-19 03:44:56 In all fairness, it won’t make anyone safer. Bump stocks are rarely used and no one but the Vegas shooter used one. It’s a feel good bill.
4240 2018-12-19 03:44:40 excuse me. Trump lies about his views on bump stocks and you blame his advisors? what a suck-up you are.

4244 2018-12-19 03:43:59 Yes, what a purifying effect Judge Sullivan’s comments to Flynn had on our government. No shutdown. Now criminal justice reform. And! Amazingly @NRA supports and @GOP passed a ban on bump stocks! @TheDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @MarkWarner @lauferlaw
4245 2018-12-19 03:43:10 This is under Prez Trump who in 2016 promised no restrictions on 2nd amendment, what stops the next Dem Prez from asking his DOJ to confiscate all AR 15 ? .  Prez Trump wont ask DOJ to appoint special counsel but sure has no problem criminalizing possession of Bump stocks
4246 2018-12-19 03:42:58 Republicans, as well as the NRA, are not going to support a bill to outlaw bump stocks. Republicans have too much ‘blood money’ in their pockets to support this bill.
4247 2018-12-19 03:42:52 Yep. The ban on bump stocks was only to generate inertia. They aren't going to stop there.
4248 2018-12-19 03:42:49 We can expect this kind of up & down in stocks as long as Trump is president.
4249 2018-12-19 03:42:45 Greed does not equal a leading trend.
For example, many developers later go crazy in trading derivatives and stocks only to realize it is useless. Greed is an emotion, not hobby or a calling
4250 2018-12-19 03:42:17 if the #InequalityEconomics that nurture the powergrab by the 1%, were to experience some democratic influence, stocks other than those seemingly overvalued would become more popular, widely held investments, but a recession seems more likely than a healthy market...
4251 2018-12-19 03:42:16 I don't have a problem with it. Bump Stocks do nothing but waste ammo & make you less accurate. They are a waste. Plus, I have witnessed a fast finger be able to put just as many rounds down range while maintaining accuracy.

Bump Stocks = fun

Guns aren't toys!

My 2 cents...
4252 2018-12-19 03:42:14 Wow....you are reaching now.   How many guns does the average bump stock owner own? And what is the real loss to that person who doesn’t even need it if they are genuine sports persons?  Bump stocks are for thrill shooters or killersvote for humanity.
4253 2018-12-19 03:42:03 Bump stocks aren't the problem! Unstable people getting their hands on guns is the problem.
4254 2018-12-19 03:42:03 TIME TO BUY!!!

The Stock Market is now well into "correction" territory.
Stocks are cheap. Now is a great time to buy or get into the market if you're not already.
What a great opportunity - DON'T MISS OUT ON A CHANCE TO MAKE A TON OF MONEY.
4255 2018-12-19 03:41:41 I don’t think bump stocks are a good idea, necessary or a helpful expression of the 2nd Amendment. But, labeling them as a machine gun doesn’t sound like a wise idea.
4256 2018-12-19 03:41:33 lmao millions of Americans have bump stocks, you better start informing. Might take a while
4257 2018-12-19 03:41:30 None whatsoever. All of the Parkland/Vegas victims/families were screaming for bump stocks to be outlawed. tRump just does it today? Really trying to take the attention away from all the criminal activity in his administration.
4258 2018-12-19 03:41:26 Giving Up On The #Wall - Banning Bump Stocks -Passing The #FirstStepAct Trump has become BORED with the #MAGA crowd he's moving on....Dropping Them Like A Bad Habit
4259 2018-12-19 03:41:21 I'm really tired of being attacked all the time for supporting you and having nothing to show for it. ANTIFA STILL ALLOWED TO ORGANIZE AND ATTACK US, prescription costs still crazy high, no wall, crazy high immigration,banning bump stocks, drug war still raging, Ocare alive& well
4260 2018-12-19 03:41:18 They took away their bump stocks today!
4261 2018-12-19 03:40:49 What are you talking about? Did he report on bump stocks?  

You’re making your point really poorly; just come out and say whatever it is you’re trying to say.
4262 2018-12-19 03:40:43 People who play with only 2 stocks online like their chicken unseasoned.
4263 2018-12-19 03:40:39 What happens to all the bump stocks stored in private arsenals across our nation?

I'm happy for the ban, but, ........
4264 2018-12-19 03:40:18 In the bull phase, the rotation was taking stocks up, now working in reverse
4265 2018-12-19 03:40:00 Trump to officially ban bump stocks. Thanks Obama.
4266 2018-12-19 03:39:56 Bump stocks are unnecessary and pretty much a pointless accessory, unless you are attacking in force and need suppressing fire.
4267 2018-12-19 03:39:44 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
4268 2018-12-19 03:39:42 The #FirstStepAct and banning bump stocks are both good. They just coincidentally happened while 20 other horrible things were happening..
4269 2018-12-19 03:39:02 Given the average 30 pct SLR holdings, why are bank stocks not on top buy lists? When yields fall 75 bp banks can easily take care of provision and write offs. NPA fears should start to fade from this FY. Govt needs to increase SLR limit for FII if it falls short
4270 2018-12-19 03:39:02 Trump's a New Yorker never expected him to stick his neck out on bump stocks.

That's a problem, however, we're still a year + from 2020. We'll see what happens.

I fully support the criminal justice reform bill. We imprison far too many people!
4271 2018-12-19 03:38:24 Usually if millie said the Earth was flat, I'd go with it...but but p stocks are a waste of time and money. From a guy who builds rifles and shoots quite a bit. Bump stocks are USELESS.
4272 2018-12-19 03:38:19 In banking, stocks and security. Under Obama he curtailed immigration to a specific number during one insurrection in one country. At the Mexican boarder he tried to stop problems using the Military, the Republicans stopped it.
4273 2018-12-19 03:37:46 your can of olives that has been used to ruin this perfectly good dish of food will see you dragged before the courts, your head in stocks and your pants around your ankles as we parade you through the streets where children may whip rotten apples at your bare ass
4274 2018-12-19 03:37:37 No. Next they will march about just plain stocks and pistol grips, also all guns have to have wood on it somewhere. Because, otherwise it looks to scary.
4275 2018-12-19 03:37:17 I'm currently recording the opening and closing amounts of the stocks on my #watchlist -- Once I've gotten a good amount of data I will give a brief write-up of my findings. #Trends #Analysis #investing #stocks #stocktrading
4276 2018-12-19 03:36:56 W.D.Gann always felt stocks were paper products only. He believed in the “touchy-feely” commodities market. You can take delivery of live feeder cattle, 1000 shares on “xyz” not so much.
4277 2018-12-19 03:36:33 Yeah but what you're doing is pretty much pissing it away though. That money could be used on other things, or other, more profitable ways to make money. Yes profit can bring risk, but stocks are risky for no reason
4278 2018-12-19 03:35:40 @NRA says it may go bankrupt. Its solution? Sue to prevent regulation of bump stocks. Mmm hmmmm.
4279 2018-12-19 03:35:17 Selling half quantity of Bajaj Fin in panic is my big mistake in 2018 correction. I wish to buy/add quality stocks in a correction up to 9500 before May 2019.

4281 2018-12-19 03:34:34 It's not really an assault on the 2nd Amendment. It's a piece of plastic, not a firearm itself. If they were banning firearms, then it would be different. The 2nd guarantees right to bear arms, not bump stocks.
4282 2018-12-19 03:34:23 2 days nalang  see u soonest pinsan ko  wala ng makain mga alaga natin dito ubos na stocks hahaha!
4283 2018-12-19 03:34:15 Yes I understand that. And speaking from experience, they not very accurate. Still wondering if they actually said he used bump stocks or not. 

Look....im not against the banning of bump stocks because ill never own one. I have no use for one. But where does it end?
4284 2018-12-19 03:34:00 Bump stocks should be banned. I know it would end up w Libs wanting more bans after the fact, but there is no need for bump stocks on any guns.
4285 2018-12-19 03:33:54 I have read almost hundred of books for stock picking, stock identification, common stocks etc., Seems like world is busy with "Art of buying a stock"

I didn't find the true nurture of "Art of selling a stock"
4286 2018-12-19 03:33:45 seems like a science of forestry isn't modern enough to build a biodiversity that builds salmon stocks for orca...
4287 2018-12-19 03:33:44 i do agree with Cramer nightmare to hold bank stocks. Look @ $BAC terrible. how many yrs to get back $30 a share. ha ha      Cramer's lightning round: 'It's too nightmarish' to own bank stocks in
4288 2018-12-19 03:33:32 Bump stocks are dope tho
4289 2018-12-19 03:33:31 Bump stocks were officially banned today. When asked why I keep up the fight for gun violence prevention, I always say  it takes baby steps. To all who have helped @thteensaction, thank you. The fight isn't over. However, for now breathe easy. We'll win this. Give it time.

4293 2018-12-19 03:32:49 Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump for passing a a ban on bump stocks. Shame you didn’t do it before they were responsible for the murders of dozens of innocent people. Did the @NRA pay for the delay?
4294 2018-12-19 03:32:47 ppl literally still play with 2 stocks 5 min. what the fuck guys
4295 2018-12-19 03:32:20 Thankfully @Yelp ‘s stocks have tanked and hopefully will stop extorting businesses soon by being out of business.
4296 2018-12-19 03:32:12 Well, doing stocks on your own is risky, very risky. It’s much better to get a broker. Even then, it’s still tantamount to gambling. It’s really not the way to sustain yourself at all. That’s not what it was meant for.
4297 2018-12-19 03:31:41 Dylan is 100% correct... and if you do this Trading Stocks and Commodities, you'll have your handed to you... it's called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and causes you to chase after prices that have already moved out.

4301 2018-12-19 03:30:49 @NRA Bump stock new rule mandates owners would be required to destroy or surrender the devices to authorities. Members of the public will be given 90 days to turn in or otherwise discard their bump stocks, according to a source familiar with the final rule.
4302 2018-12-19 03:30:48 @NConservatarian you actually don’t think banning bump stocks is a permissible regulation? Do they serve any lawful purpose?
4303 2018-12-19 03:30:42 I have 2 AR15s not scared of any one! I can tell you this, only the fring right wing wants bump stocks. It has nothing to do with my right to Bear Arms! So why are you making a big deal about this again? Maybe you should have been to Vegas and seen in person what I seen.

4308 2018-12-19 03:29:31 we will keep our guns, they aren't going away because of bump stocks
4309 2018-12-19 03:29:27 They're worried about us having some bump stocks and I'm thinking we need some missile launchers. Too many planes making too many lines in the sky. #GeoEngineering #Chemtrails #WeDoNotConsent
4310 2018-12-19 03:29:24 Ok. Have fun with your conspiracies ya nut. We never landed on the moon and 911 was an inside job. BTW blaming “evil CEOs” is ignorant. CEOs are responsive to stockholders. Most of us want stocks to go up so we can retire. So I guess we are all evil
4311 2018-12-19 03:29:06 Any gun legislation is a legitimate concern. Elimination of bump stocks however is not. A bump stock ban is akin to nascar banning blindfolds on drivers. Out of 1,100 rds fired, the Vegas shooter killed 58. His use of a bump stock is the reason there weren’t 500+ fatalities.
4312 2018-12-19 03:27:59 I had a respiratory therapist for a while who told me he made a ton on stocks by studying when people bought things, and that his James Hetfield went to thanksgiving dinner with him every year

He was a lot worse at lying than he thought he was
4313 2018-12-19 03:27:55 Now if bump stocks went away I wouldn't cry over them....but ask our politicians to give resources to law enforcement to effectively enforce laws on the books...and increase the waiting periods...also make mental health care cheaper and easier to get.

4316 2018-12-19 03:27:32 Yes, look at trading Stocks and Commodities... especially if each person is looking at the same data but on different time frames... Thousands of transactions take place daily... and why? Because you have an agreement on PRICE but a DISAGREEMENT on VALUE 
4317 2018-12-19 03:27:25 Bump stocks use the recoil to move your finger forward and back on the trigger. Its still semi-auto by definition of action, but you can pull the trigger faster than you could with out it.

Full auto still has to chamber a round, but you can hold the trigger and it will continue
4318 2018-12-19 03:27:07 I love my President, but banning bump stocks is a step in the wrong direction. Not about the bump stocks themselves, but it opens up to ban more gun related things more easily. 

#2AShallNotBeInfringed
4319 2018-12-19 03:27:06 Wrong and wrong. No one cares about bump stocks.
4320 2018-12-19 03:26:42 You know what's progress? Build the F*ing wall, Flynn's case is dismissed, Seth Rich's murderer is held to account, and bump stocks are NOT illegal. #FedUp
4321 2018-12-19 03:26:37 Anyone who suggests stocks will never go down is irrelevant and not worth giving any attention to.
4322 2018-12-19 03:26:32 Bump stocks make barrels rotate!? Please tell me more!!!

Btw it is “you’re” not your. But you learned that in 3rd grade right?

Now back to those rotating barrels and bump stocks... tell me how these are related? And tell me which firearm citizens can own with “rotating” barrels
4323 2018-12-19 03:26:23 Democrats pushed for bump stocks to be illegal and much more, good news its already being overturned heres a fun fact a pair of pants belt loop is a effective bump stock you see Socialism and gun control have a very long history together learn it before it kills you!
4324 2018-12-19 03:25:53 The US makes up less than 5% of the worlds population, but hold 31% of global mass shooters. You know that the stats are not on your side but you and other gun nuts just keep babbling on. Even trump is banning bump stocks.
4325 2018-12-19 03:25:43 @aphriainc a tarnished reputation, a low P/E ratio and the high demand for marijuana stocks could revive Aphria stock. To be sure, the current stature of Aphria’s management makes APHA a risky bet. A deal with $DEO Apha with rise 25% FIRE  @Vic_Neufeld It will rise 60%
4326 2018-12-19 03:25:34 I do not use the same technique for all my trades, this trade got generated from something else
4327 2018-12-19 03:25:30 Well if Kavanauh has his way these bans will be unconstitutional if bump stocks can be shown to achieve sufficient popularity amongst the gun owning community.

Vote her OUT in 2020!!

4330 2018-12-19 03:24:33 President Trump banned bump stocks.

4332 2018-12-19 03:24:30 Bump stocks means nothing Chrissy boy. You’ll never be able to ban assault rifles. They will always be readily available for purchase on the deep web. Maybe you should pay for the larceny you have committed....or just face the warrant

4335 2018-12-19 03:23:32 @cameron_kasky  I'm surprised that more people arent talking about the Trump administration's ban of bump stocks. Kinda shocking, isn't.
4336 2018-12-19 03:23:14 Bump stocks were officially banned today. This is why we fight so hard. This is a victory for every single activist who has spent countless hours fighting for change. We are not going to back down now. This is just the beginning.
4337 2018-12-19 03:23:12 Bump stocks are a joke. But the government just chips away little by little on our rights as free men. And if the people continue to just go along with the constant erosion of the 2nd amendment, the nation will look worse than Ca, NY, NJ. Gotta put up a fight now
4338 2018-12-19 03:23:09 Had bump stocks been armed, they'd still be alive today @igorvolsky 
4339 2018-12-19 03:22:55 That is probably the major key factor in the strategy, have to be looking at the right stocks & might miss some moves but if you are patient & study the behavior of the stock you’ll find a few setups during the day. Best moves are at open or after lunch hour.
4340 2018-12-19 03:22:33 At least Trump hasn’t handed out advice on how to make bump stocks from WINE CORKS, like @RepClayHiggins.
4341 2018-12-19 03:22:32 #2A rights? Where is the outrage? Trump banned bump stocks. Oh, I see. #cutthepuppetstrings

4357 2018-12-19 03:18:52 First off I want to say that what happened that night was horrible and in no way am I trying to downplay what that monster did. But statistically... 58 out of 22,000 from an elevated position? I'd call that inaccurate. Did they ever come out and say that he used bump stocks?
4358 2018-12-19 03:18:45 The NRA doesn’t care about bump stocks. Almost no one uses them anyway.

4362 2018-12-19 03:18:31 #TrumpsVeryBadDay. Trump Foundation gone.  Caved on border wall.  Flynn got reamed by the Judge.  Banned bump stocks (which I support but his base doesn’t).  Secret Grand Jury subpoena stands.  NY AG still strong.  Dow in toilet.  #TrumpsRecession.  And, emoluments.  Sad!
4363 2018-12-19 03:18:12 I don't need one for my AR-15; I don't want one. I've fired the M-16 A1 on full auto in the Army, it destroys your accuracy. Even worse with the bump stocks. That's why newer military rifles fire in 3 round bursts, not full auto.
4364 2018-12-19 03:17:37 Because bump stocks are stupid. No serious gun owners use them and the main creator/distributor of bump stocks ceased sales and production months ago.

4367 2018-12-19 03:17:20 No violent offenders are included.  Bump stocks, to me, are not necessary.  Who says he caved on a border wall?
4368 2018-12-19 03:16:59 If the news I’m seeing trickling by is accurate, then Trump banned bump stocks. This is a rare occasion where I agree with something he did (or that was done by others in his name) and I will publicly say: thank you.
4369 2018-12-19 03:16:52 All right, I'm done with bump stocks. You want your bump stocks go get them. Hell you can make them out of rubber bands.
4370 2018-12-19 03:16:51 Bullshit. Stocks are doing a dead-cat bounce daily. Investors have been squeamish for months. But you don't know what that means, just believe everthang Trump tells ya. Lol. The joke will be on you, buddy.
4371 2018-12-19 03:16:40 Again cut and paste. Very sad come back. Cut and paste the GDP, unemployment for everyone.  Woman, hispanics and african Americans. Yeah he is Killing it for Americans.  Gas prices like way down. Stocks higher than when obooomanleft and will go higher. What else do you have?
4372 2018-12-19 03:16:19 Bump stocks are banned and the senate passed a criminal justice reform bill??? Are we in an alternate timeline??? If so, can we stay in this one ????
4373 2018-12-19 03:16:02 @realDonaldTrump You're banning bump stocks??? Bad move!!! It's the beginning of total gun confiscation! You're being fooled. I thought you were smarter than that? The Las Vegas shooter was a plant! Computers stolen? Ha!
4374 2018-12-19 03:15:55 And is the government going to buy back all the bump stocks? Or are they just going to prosecute people that dont want to throw away the bump stocks that they paid m ok net for? Or worse, take them by force.
4375 2018-12-19 03:15:18 It doesn’t matter if they ban bump stocks, who will actually turn them in/or destroy?  The good guys might but there are several hundred thousand out there and if someone wants it, they will get it.
4376 2018-12-19 03:15:07 Bump stocks make it easier to ID the smocking gun.

4380 2018-12-19 03:14:26 Gun sales are going up as are Gun  stocks.
4381 2018-12-19 03:14:17 Conflicted, today.

Gotta give props to the Senate & POTUS for banning bump stocks (step in the right direction), passing criminal justice reform (step in the right direction)...
4382 2018-12-19 03:14:17 I don’t have any problems with bump stocks bun. Wall will be build by “red castle”. Some reforms are needed (if you believe or not in injustice)...
4383 2018-12-19 03:14:03 By the way, Bump Stocks are not banned. You will be able to legally own them just like any NFA item. Pass the background checks, pay the fees and you can own them. The government isn't banning, but restricting them.

4389 2018-12-19 03:13:06 I am a member of the NRA I see no need for bump stocks when sending rounds down range you do it in burst of three and with control just an old veteran
4390 2018-12-19 03:13:00 Good job banning bump stocks!!
4391 2018-12-19 03:12:53 Bump stocks are a recent phenomenon, but they were used in Las Vegas. They're very different from handguns. I don't think bump stocks are scary at all. I think their impact is.
4392 2018-12-19 03:12:46 With stocks doing a dead-cat bounce. Investors have been squeamish for months now. This is not new. Still need a couple more months before hard data catches up with consumer confidence though. I give it 3 more months.

4394 2018-12-19 03:12:32 Bump stocks can go on the majority of weapons
4395 2018-12-19 03:12:17 you don't remember @realDonaldTrump's primary campaign rally in Arizona? where he gave that big speech about banning BUMP Stocks & letting criminals out of jail early because they deserved a 2nd chance?? that's the speech where he promised unambiguously "There will be NO AMNESTY"
4396 2018-12-19 03:12:07 About time! Anyone who knows anything about firearms knows these bump stocks are used for fun. Bump-stocks handle nothing like a real Full Auto and are inaccurate as hell.
4397 2018-12-19 03:11:52 There has to be some compromise or Tump isn't really leading. He's dictating. Bump stocks are an easy give away.
4398 2018-12-19 03:11:22 The ban under-enforced means bump stocks have to change their name. Over-enforced means they have to ban aftermarket trigger springs. And rubber bands.
4399 2018-12-19 03:11:17 Sssshhhh! Stocks at Dow Jones are listening
4400 2018-12-19 03:11:11 Yeah you're all over the media making laughing stocks of yourselves
4401 2018-12-19 03:11:07 Personally, this is a PR move w/ no real substance behind it. Who will be monitoring bump stocks are being turned in or destroyed? Are there laws against selling/buying bump stocks? What about gerryrigging bump stocks from other materials? Makes one wonder why one needs a semi AR
4402 2018-12-19 03:11:05 It only took over a dozen mass shootings to see bump stocks banned, yet I have the distinct feeling it was done to distract from scandal, not to make people safer.
4403 2018-12-19 03:10:35 Update- Bump stocks will be baned starting late march
4404 2018-12-19 03:10:35 Things passed as Bipartisan under Trump:

Omnibus
Bump Stocks Ban
Criminal Justice Reform

Things not done in a Bipartisan manner:

Reduction of The National Debt
4405 2018-12-19 03:10:26 Nice to contribute to the overpopulation of seals and help decimate our salmon stocks.

4407 2018-12-19 03:09:52 It’s the actions that I think will cause him to lose the next election. Banning Bump Stocks through executive order sets precedent for the next dem president to ban whatever they want. It’s scary.

4419 2018-12-19 03:04:47 Guns are dangerous tools, bump stocks or no. It would be far more effective for licenses and training to be required before purchasing ammunition.

Even if we regulated the guns, many would still fall into the wrong hands via gifting and trading. Ammo is finite and controllable.

4421 2018-12-19 03:04:05 Bump Stocks have been banned. With the gun from the Las Vegas Shooting. But who legalized it to begin with? Well, I found out from everyone who Googled it, it was none other than the President who everyone loved. Barack, Obama!
4422 2018-12-19 03:03:42 @MarkYusko hopefully a lot of that money that is getting out of stocks/bonds/commodities goes into crypto....because no other asset class has bottomed.
4423 2018-12-19 03:03:39 I don’t have any bump stocks.   But you can kiss my ass if you think i would turn one in
4424 2018-12-19 03:03:35 Yeah. But if you adjust the historical CAPE for the level of interest rates (eg, using TNX), you see that stocks are priced pretty fairly today. Actually, they are being priced below the historical average. The problem is that nobody is looking at that metric right now.
4425 2018-12-19 03:03:00 What a classic NPC response. You’re not programmed to argue bump stocks,  which is the topic, so you start spewing your canned talking points.
4426 2018-12-19 03:02:57 @slide63 well let’s see. Brother Trumps order on bump stocks gives us 90 days to turn them in or destroy them.  Or wah lah we become criminals.   I’m gonna ignore that illegal order and law.  Just like they ignore the ones they don’t like..... soooo fuck off wid dat shit
4427 2018-12-19 03:02:54 It was the AG. Im veryy pro 2nd but we dont need bump stocks. Even the NRA agreed
4428 2018-12-19 03:02:40 Thanks for banning bump stocks.
4429 2018-12-19 03:02:04 In ALL fairness, here is a complete and full list of all of the good things Trump has accomplished in his 23 months if office:

- Banned bump gun stocks

--end of list--
4430 2018-12-19 03:01:59 ot. YET.  Not NYET.  Oh this is going to be a FUN ride!!!!! Enjoy it while you all can!!!!!!!!! OHhhhhh by the way, ban on ALL bump stocks!  BY @realDonaldTrump, can you effing believe that!!!!! Happy Holidays!
4431 2018-12-19 03:01:55 You will see those stocks blow up! As soon as I learn to play this game. Ryu feels like a whole new character haha probably still a godly char though
4432 2018-12-19 03:01:30 Today was a bad day for President Trump. 

- officially banned gun bump stocks
- caved on building a border wall
- endorsed Senate criminal justice reform bill that will release thousands of violent criminals

Don't abandon your base or you'll lose in 2020.
4433 2018-12-19 03:01:17 Not really, but keep dreaming I guess. Have you ever shot or purchased a gun? Do you know what bump stocks do?
4434 2018-12-19 03:01:16 Yes but did bump stocks have to be banned you all infringed our 2nd amendment. How many of our rights will you take to make the dems happy.
4435 2018-12-19 03:00:55 @realDonaldTrump are you ashamed of your part with the bump stocks.   You should be, there's over 130,000,000 gun owners in the US.  And you just betrayed or alienated atleast 70% , those who understand SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED.  Wording that doesn't get much clearer.
4436 2018-12-19 03:00:30 Thank you for the work with bump stocks and prison reform.
4437 2018-12-19 03:00:23 they were, but you had stocks going up 20-30% during expiration week, which was always my favorite time to trade at the time due to the lower premiums.
4438 2018-12-19 03:00:19 Thank you!
I need to see you end some stocks at 40% 
4439 2018-12-19 02:59:45 I don't see it that way, as I said any common sense gun owner knows that bump stocks are idiotic. And that's not what the Las Vegas shooter used.  But I can see your point. They infringed 2A rights in the 80s, and nobody talks about it.
4440 2018-12-19 02:59:41 I saw about BUMP STOCKS on the news but BUMP STOCKS were not used in the murders at Parkland
4441 2018-12-19 02:59:35 $SPY when I started trading just indexes, either inverse or regular. I seem to make more  than I did just trading regular stocks.
4442 2018-12-19 02:59:26 My first thought today when I heard that bump stocks had been outlawed was “those Parkland kids are going change our world.” @davidhogg111 @Emma4Change
4443 2018-12-19 02:59:11 You should make a life jacket out of bump stocks in case it happens again
4444 2018-12-19 02:59:10 Bump stocks were made illegal in US today. Credit given where credit due. Thank you @davidhogg111
4445 2018-12-19 02:58:54 @SkillUpYT Hey what are your thoughts on the Trump Administration enacting a ban on bump stocks? If you don't want to publicly respond to my question you can always just DM what ya think.
P.S. looking forward to your next video!
4446 2018-12-19 02:58:29 Bump stocks don’t make guns like machine guns. That is the most idiotic thing I’ve ever heard.
4447 2018-12-19 02:58:02 It’s a good thing. You’ll need room to house all those new felons who fail to destroy or surrender their bump stocks. 

ATF estimates perhaps 400,000?
4448 2018-12-19 02:57:32 They banning bump stocks?
4449 2018-12-19 02:57:22 It was on CNN Tamara...but they just outlawed bump stocks. People have 90 days to turn them in. After that, it is criminal if they are caught with one. I believe background checks should be done at police stations so there are INSTANT results!
4450 2018-12-19 02:56:56 I can’t even with my mentions right now. Before you even try talking about bump stocks PLEASE know how they function. And the difference between semi auto and full auto.
4451 2018-12-19 02:56:46 Yellow vests and bump stocks
4452 2018-12-19 02:56:43 When you are VP, make sure stocks only go up under your administration.

I was promised so much winning under the current administration.

Tired of losing so much under El Trumpo.

Make Stocks Go Up Again.
4453 2018-12-19 02:56:02 Riddle me this: So Obama tries to ban bump stocks and people are up in arms. Donald bands bump stocks and its magically ok now. Alright?
4454 2018-12-19 02:55:35 @realDonaldTrump You lost a lot of conservative voters when your DOJ banned bump stocks. Just eroding our 2A right. Shame on you!
4455 2018-12-19 02:55:32 Lock all accounts personal business trades stocks bonds federal reserve. World banks. Bush is going to hi jack our economy he knows he's done. Halibertion is out of business.
4456 2018-12-19 02:55:18 Attorney General just signed the final rule making clear that bump stocks are now illegal and need to be destroyed by March 21.
4457 2018-12-19 02:54:12 It would be delusional to think banning bump stocks are relevant in preventing mass shootings.

Ironically, crime involving bump stocks only stands to increase. Not because they are popular among mass shooters, but because of exec. order turning ordinary citizens into criminals.
4458 2018-12-19 02:53:44 In all reality none of this share movement in 7974 is N specific.  It's basically performed in-line with the $GAMR ETF.  The 20 mln argument is total nonsense... it's been joined at the hip with all other gaming stocks... for better or worse.  NOT N SPECIFIC.
4459 2018-12-19 02:53:38 Yes, bump stocks exist mostly to thumb one's nose at the NFA.

No, it will hurt nothing if they are banned.

No, it will not change anything for the better either.

No, arbitrarily banning a thing that it was expressly legal to buy previously is not a good way to go about this.
4460 2018-12-19 02:53:07 People who equate bump stocks to fully automatic rifles are the same people who believe flip-chart pictures in the corner of their notebook are the same thing as a motion picture.

4467 2018-12-19 02:50:47 Hey @NRA how you feel about your guy taking away bump stocks?  Slippery slope to banning guns has started!

4470 2018-12-19 02:49:32 They don’t fight for shit, no comment to bump stocks but they want me to send checks every week. No thanks. I like GOA better.
4471 2018-12-19 02:49:18 Yes bump stocks are hilarious
4472 2018-12-19 02:48:55 you don't remember @realDonaldTrump's primary campaign rally in Arizona? where he gave that big speech about banning BUMP Stocks & letting criminals out of jail early because they deserved a 2nd chance?? that's the speech where he promised unambiguously "There will be NO AMNESTY"
4473 2018-12-19 02:48:30 Trump signed a law banning bump stocks and will probably sign The First Step Act. Get a legalization bill to his desk I bet he will sign it.
4474 2018-12-19 02:48:29 Were you originally talking about bump stocks? Or the policy prescriptions in my tweet?
4475 2018-12-19 02:47:25 Bump stocks may not seem like much,but that’s how countries band weapons, they slowly compromise until they officially ban all weapons.
4476 2018-12-19 02:46:57 I see your point. I mean technically if you keep outlawing accessories you eventually start outlawing triggers, right?  I appreciate your passion for the 2nd. We agree on that. I just wanted to point out that bump stocks aren't guns, nor are they even important accessories.
4477 2018-12-19 02:46:23 Don't care about wall 401K stocks??
4478 2018-12-19 02:45:47 We will not. why did Trump signed over almost 10 billion to Mexicos and Central America's aid? How about taking care of our own. And outlawing bump stocks will lead us all down that slippery slope we see already in the Democratic States on gun accessories and banning AR15 & more

4484 2018-12-19 02:44:18 Over the past 38 years (76 rate hikes), the @federalreserve has only raised rates 2 times when stocks were lower on a 3, 6, and 12 month basis. More importantly, with INFLATION LOW and OIL FALLING, why hike now? Pause and watch; don't hike unnecessarily!
4485 2018-12-19 02:43:33 Damn, I would short any bow tie stocks.
4486 2018-12-19 02:43:28 Oh FFS, ok, fight to get your bump stocks back. I support you, but don't bring those pieces of shit to any of my courses.
4487 2018-12-19 02:43:18 @realDonaldTrump  you have a snake on your team that is talking you into stuff that should not happen.. just like the ban on bump stocks. banning them is just the first step to taking the 2nd amendment away, the way this ban is going down will get people killed and jailed wrongly
4488 2018-12-19 02:43:11 @DLCMemphisLaw  I bet your DOJ wouldn’t be banning bump stocks

4491 2018-12-19 02:41:47 That said, I can see your concerns regarding the 2nd. I just think bump stocks aren't the hill we die on for the 2nd.
4492 2018-12-19 02:41:46 This is what I've been asking myself for a while. My speciality is crypto not stocks, but I mean... did 2008 happen while everyone was saying it would? people who said recession were seen as cooks.
4493 2018-12-19 02:41:45 Except the bump stocks were reclassified, not banned. That means it was done in a way that can potentially allow people to keep their bump stocks as long as they pay a fee.

Not enough!!
4494 2018-12-19 02:41:28 The head of our executive branch may be an idiot, but we've gotten bump stocks outlawed AND criminal justice reform passed.  It's been a good week!
4495 2018-12-19 02:40:44 I call Bullshit. Trumpublcans had better start taking responsibility for their own dirty dealings. When the stocks were up, those idiots took responsibility but now when it's down, suddenly it's bipartisan! Hah!!!!
4496 2018-12-19 02:40:43 Yes, asset prices are inflated mainly real estate and stocks. It hasn’t reflected on consumer goods yet. Purchasing power of dollar will dramatically decrease. So the future dollars you get from bonds will not buy much if you keep until it matures.
4497 2018-12-19 02:40:29 My goodness. Stop with the stupid wall! A recession is coming because of your tax cut and trade war with China! This is the worst December for stocks since the Depression. This is on YOU!#MuellerIsComing Thank God!!
4498 2018-12-19 02:40:25 Wonder what the "I'm not against immigration; I'm against ILLEGAL immigration" crowd will do with bump stocks now. Will they obey the law like good bootlickers or will 1776 commence again?
4499 2018-12-19 02:40:22 Dude, don’t you get it? A national enterprise that stocks its stores with brands and products they’ve legally obtained the rights to through shared deals, benefits, and marketing plans is totally equivalent to a celebrity that scams his fans with cheap Chinese consoles! #Stoopid
4500 2018-12-19 02:40:00 Isn't it becoz of nifty weekly expiry the heavy weights stocks like reliance..hdfc twins will be manipulated like hell.

4505 2018-12-19 02:39:00 Sounds good but I feel so sorry for the kids.  Feel sorry that they have to learn in these circumstances and you only talk about fortifications.  Tell the nra we've had enough.  At least you did go after bump stocks but I almost wonder why. Guess they didn't donate enough.
4506 2018-12-19 02:38:58 -Or the ban on wearing shoes through the TSA, or the ban on smoking while filling your tank, or the ban on pesticides on your lettuce. 

Ban the bump stocks!!!
4507 2018-12-19 02:38:51 You are making a disastrous mistake going after Bump stocks, leave our 2nd Ammendment alone Mr. President..You will lose many, many, votes over this..
4508 2018-12-19 02:38:27 Criminal justice reform and banning bump stocks.  Two positive political news items in one day... is this what our grandparents used to feel like?
4509 2018-12-19 02:38:22 Liz, you are right as usual.. Banning bump stocks is a big step towards tyranny.  President Trump is wrong,  and the NRA is wrong, on this one.  It's a poor musician,  who blames his instrument. Our great nation just became weaker
4510 2018-12-19 02:38:14 Is this anything like the bill that will “fix” all those mean guns and turn them into “nice” guns since @realDonaldTrump is banning bump stocks? What’s next? High capacity mags? Looks like this will finish what @BillClinton started in the 90s.
4511 2018-12-19 02:37:43 Another profitable day for my stocks :) woot woot, lets get it 
4512 2018-12-19 02:37:37 Lol idiots think bump stocks are dangerous. Don’t know much about firearms do ya? But it’s not about them is it? It’s about clawing away another inch.
4513 2018-12-19 02:37:26 @realDonaldTrump No one gives a crap about bump stocks. We do care for the right to bear arms. The executive action is proof that you have no regard for the seperation of power.  since the order doesnt make us any safer, it also proves there is a high likelyhood you don’t care.
4514 2018-12-19 02:37:20 I am a proud supporter of the NRA but I don’t see any place for bump stocks in any firearms collection

4516 2018-12-19 02:37:13 He just banned bump stocks, making a serious hit to the 2A
4517 2018-12-19 02:36:52 @Liz_Wheeler The operation facilitated by bump stocks can be manually accomplished and therefore banning the stock device will not help anything.  How about making sure law abiding citizens have means to protect themselves from nutjobs who commit murder?
4518 2018-12-19 02:36:39 Thanks for great reporting on this, Stephen.
Is the ban on bump stocks or stocks that could be made to bump? I ask cuz the slide fire has a switch that is basically Bump/Don't Bump that could be pinned to "off"
Darker thought, any stock can be made to bump, as you well know.
4519 2018-12-19 02:36:32 You stand with the banning of bump stocks and the erosion of our 2A?
4520 2018-12-19 02:36:24 Your organization is so FU**ing tone deaf. You’re dumbasses even supported bumper stocks, which are modifications that have absolutely nothing to do with your 2nd amendment rights. Unless it states being able to kill as many as people as possible, in the least amount of time.

4522 2018-12-19 02:36:03 You will lose a lot of support if you ban anything to do with firearms.  I don't use bump stocks but you don't have the Constitutional right to ban them.
4523 2018-12-19 02:35:44 How does banning bump stocks or building a border wall stop banks and investment firms from gambling away billions/trillions of tax dollars away and causing a global financial collapse like they did in 2008? It doesn't, in fact it can happen again, and again, and again.

Bump stocks are a joke, but read the language and realize it’s not about bump stocks. We have given up enough of our rights. Wake up, fudd.
4537 2018-12-19 02:31:36 Stocks Down into end of year.... This December will make the record books
4538 2018-12-19 02:31:34 Not even the same argument, one says I like it so it should be my “right” to have it. I’m pretty sure bump stocks were invented long after the 2nd amendment. Nobody took our guns only an unnecessary modification
4539 2018-12-19 02:31:33 #FirstStepAct Great day today!

4547 2018-12-19 02:29:30 Banning bump stocks is the absolute minimum they could do for gun control. It should have been done Oct. 2 after Las Vegas. Not really impressed.
4548 2018-12-19 02:29:09 @realDonaldTrump cant just take away stuff we own like bump stocks. Going to have to pay for them.
4549 2018-12-19 02:29:06 I suppose it isn't though honestly making bump stocks illegal wont really do anything neither would making "assualt weapoms illegal. I mean hunting rifles are stronger than assualt weapons.
4550 2018-12-19 02:29:05 Haven’t seen this many missed passes and pucks bouncing off their stocks since last year
4551 2018-12-19 02:29:04 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump

Dear Mr. Trump:

I hear you look at the markets to judge how well you are doing.  Considering the market is on its way to being the worst December since 1931 for stocks, I guess you could say you are doing a very poor job.

Sincerely,
Anya Marie
4552 2018-12-19 02:28:42 Bump stocks aren't guns.
4553 2018-12-19 02:28:31 How many EU stocks are foreseen to be at MSY next year? Will an official press release follow now?
4554 2018-12-19 02:27:58 I’m not happy about the ban on bump stocks to me that’s against the Constitution. Why he did that I’m not sure why. Prison reform is a good thing for many families across America especially to the ethnic population & could very well help him in the next election.
4555 2018-12-19 02:27:52 Wow, Iv'e been looking at investing strategys and I am not one to consider investing in stocks at this day and age. When 10 percent of Americans control 84 percent of the stock wealth as studies indicate, are stocks safe?I don't think so...glad I don't put my money in them thangs
4556 2018-12-19 02:27:25 #BREAKING: Trump bans ‘bump stocks’ that were used in the Las Vegas mass shooting. Owners of the high-power machine gun have 90 days to turn in or destroy the device and aren’t unable to register them. #gunreform
4557 2018-12-19 02:27:17 US market ends in the green, although, S&P 500 ends just above its 2018 low Tuesday as stocks struggle to keep a rebound alive throughout the session
4558 2018-12-19 02:26:54 As a POM can definitely sympathise!!!  Being O- feel it particularly keenly when O- stocks are low ...
4559 2018-12-19 02:26:51 come to sasuke's online arena if you want to throw hands, i set it to 1v1 3 minute matches because i dont find stocks fun and also i have like half items off because some of them just suck
4560 2018-12-19 02:26:49 If Ju$tin, Butts and assorted Ministers would do a cross country tour volunteering to be placed in the stocks so peoplekind could throw things at them the deficit would be paid off in record time. I would gladly line up for the chance and pay for it !!!!!
4561 2018-12-19 02:26:37 Bump stocks are absolutely stupid and pointless and useless other than for fun at the range. But they absolutely should not be banned.
4562 2018-12-19 02:26:08 My mom thought bump stocks were something related to the stock market
4563 2018-12-19 02:25:38 @realDonaldTrump We the people lost all of the bump stocks in a boating accident in the swamp that was supposed to be drained, best of luck getting to the bottom of it.
4564 2018-12-19 02:25:17 Somebody typoed. It was supposed to ban Gump Stocks.
4565 2018-12-19 02:24:30 In the guise of moderation it's about a whole "Lot" more than bump stocks.

What would be an acceptable "rate of fire" to an anti 2A administration.....

4568 2018-12-19 02:23:45 At least he backed down on the wall (which is still a great album) AND banned bump stocks today. Your hero!
4569 2018-12-19 02:23:35 @realDonaldTrump   Thank you for banning bump stocks!
4570 2018-12-19 02:23:11 No, the real question is who would be stupid enough not to turn it in.  Nobody is going to knock on doors at 4am.  They'll be at your house for something minor and find bump stocks and instead of a misdemeanor ticket you'll be charged with a felony.
4571 2018-12-19 02:23:08 Sir aap stocks batao....Govt minister ne kaha hai account mein 15 Lakh aane waala hai...Sab laga doonga bazaar mein....

4573 2018-12-19 02:22:37 Amazing it is the NRA loving trump who bans the stocks.  Wondering what folks are saying.
4574 2018-12-19 02:22:33 President Trump. I think you are wrong on banning bump stocks.   It's a poor musician,  who blames his instrument.   I do support the NRA, but the are wrong on this one, as well.   You can't stay a free nation, by bargaining away our constitutional right,

4578 2018-12-19 02:21:43 So while optimism is plunging the companies are buying back their stocks.  Smart move.
4579 2018-12-19 02:21:43 Despite the fact that bump stocks got banned today the name is still staying bc the brand is too brolic
4580 2018-12-19 02:21:32 Honestly, who needs bump stocks on their gun? Banning them doesn't mean anything to me, but why are some pro gun supporters going ape shit about it?
4581 2018-12-19 02:21:30 We need a ban on lobbyists too!!  Please write some legislation to get rid of or limit lobbyists.  Thanks.   (I also support the ban on bump stocks.)
4582 2018-12-19 02:20:47 Lol! He’s a fraud. Just like his university and his casino and his charity...etc, etc, etc. He’s not building a wall. He’s not locking up anyone. Stocks are shit. The deficit is shit. All hail the game show host!

4584 2018-12-19 02:20:06 #Stocks,#Indexes ...now. (We currently lack the data for the 2000 top.) Categorically less intense variants have coincided with all other significant tops.  Hence our uncharacteristic forecast.  The figure of 1250 derives from the observation of major resistance at S&P 1500 at...
4585 2018-12-19 02:20:05 Because it would have been political suicide to have the actual lawmakers vote for it, the unelected bureaucrats get the nod.
Bump stocks are unimportant. The fight against this kind of thing is.
I lost mine in a recent boating accident.
4586 2018-12-19 02:19:58 3 (some would say good) news items you might have missed today: Trump admin banned bump stocks, HHS  speeds up process to place unaccompanied child migrants w/ relatives/ sponsors, Senate passes criminal justice reform bill.
4587 2018-12-19 02:19:42 Bump stocks are lame anyway no accuracy what so ever. Never have wanted one and I own a lot of rifles
4588 2018-12-19 02:19:41 Bump stocks will now go underground and value will quadruple. Somebody is going to get rich now.
4589 2018-12-19 02:18:50 Trump is banning bump stocks, spending money like a Leftist, and has yet to repeal and replace. Please tell me why your comparison matters here?
4590 2018-12-19 02:18:31 NO WALL,Bump stocks gone, but hey ...criminals(that will not vote Republican) are being released

4592 2018-12-19 02:18:20 #RT @LPNational: RT @nsarwark: They told me if I didn't vote Republican, the government would ban bump stocks.
4593 2018-12-19 02:18:14 I'm sorry, but any common sense person knows that bump stocks make the firearm highly inaccurate, also can be made easily at home if you really want too. I just don't see this as a violation of the 2A. 
4594 2018-12-19 02:17:58 surely that can't happen to weed stocks
4595 2018-12-19 02:17:28 I didn't think government employees used bump stocks when 150-300 native Americans were disarmed and slaughtered at wounded knee.
Learn something new everyday.
4596 2018-12-19 02:17:18 Bump stocks are a stupid gimmick, still should not have been banned. Thanks Trump #maga
4597 2018-12-19 02:17:02 Looked back on 10 of my dividend growth stocks. Total yield when I purchased them 15 years ago was 4.29%. These same stocks are now returning 11.63% YOC due to dividend growth. Plus capital appreciation of approx. 140% over the same period. The power of dividend growth + time 
4598 2018-12-19 02:16:47 The number of overfished stocks has tripled in my lifetime -- we need to do better.  Still, appreciate at the great work of your organization!
4599 2018-12-19 02:16:28 What’s the big deal with bump stocks? I’m conservative as hell and I know bump stocks have nothing to do with 2nd amendment.. No guns being taken and a slight decrease in a chance for gun malfeasance..  Y’all just looking for something to bitch about.. Good move by POTUS
4600 2018-12-19 02:16:26 I think ppl who say that (including me) mean that stocks and the economy often diverge in the short to medium term. Think few would dispute that they are linked over the long term.
4601 2018-12-19 02:15:37 Just past the halfway point for the Wednesday session with the ASX200 down 17 points- Regis Resources leading the way, up 5.3%, whilst Bega Cheese, the worst performer, down 12.1%.

4612 2018-12-19 02:13:19 Making bump stocks illegal is the last shit the NRA should be worried about.
4613 2018-12-19 02:13:17 Hey @NRA thanks for selling us out on bump stocks. I’ll support real 2nd amendment organizations from here on out.
4614 2018-12-19 02:13:14 The same way the ATF considers the sear as the fully automatic component of a machine gun. You can argue in court (as some already are), but to say that ATF is wrong misses the reality that bump stocks are trying to go around a restriction which is lawful. See DC v Heller.
4615 2018-12-19 02:13:09 Maybe not with some, but responsible gun owners are responsible gun owners whether Obama or Trump is President... we don't care either way if bump stocks get banned. It's expected.

Criminals coming in from the south or north now you’re going after bump stocks the FBI is acting like the KGB the patriot act is not even being discussed and it should be destroyed I could go on. Mise well let the criminals out what could go wrong right
4617 2018-12-19 02:12:59 How many stocks at MSY this time?
4618 2018-12-19 02:12:55 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr what 2 laws were repealed at the ATF for you to impose a law to repeal bump stocks without due process.
4619 2018-12-19 02:12:49 Trump banned BUMP STOCKS. LMAO... 
4620 2018-12-19 02:12:32 "That is so god damn nice. Why do you gotta wear dresses that hide it all the time, Stocks?"
4621 2018-12-19 02:12:25 Hey @realDonaldTrump!  I miss your dumb ass tweets about the stock market.  Have you looked lately?  Russell down 21% fast guy!  Most stocks down 20/30/40/50%!  Your oil tweets killed the sector.  Good job making America worse Again!
4622 2018-12-19 02:12:19 I can't disagree with you on that. Nor can I disagree with the ban on bump stocks. I do, however, reserve the right to disagree with whatever you tweet about next.
4623 2018-12-19 02:11:55 Many people here miss the point: bump stocks are legal because of the ATF's interpretation of the law. They have changed their interpretation, which congress and the law allows them to do. They don't need to pass a law because the NFA exists for that purpose.
4624 2018-12-19 02:11:53 Trumpy banned bump stocks. Lmao....
4625 2018-12-19 02:11:51 wait... sorry... (ignoramus here).   Do bump-stocks allow you to just keep firing non-stop until the magazine is empty?  (like AK's in movies).   And full automatics just mean you don't have to re-chamber?  And I'm assuming belt-fed weapons are illegal?  Or no?
4626 2018-12-19 02:11:43 I couldn’t care less about bump stocks. But confiscation of legally purchased private property is wrong. For any reason.
4627 2018-12-19 02:11:21 My stomach’s fine but by nose started to bleed as I watched my stocks plummet. I still haven’t sold, though, because I can’t ever take losses

4629 2018-12-19 02:10:53 There is a lot of battle coming and we need to fight the important ones. Banning bump stocks doesn't change them thinking they can take a mile because they took an inch. They already want a mile and think they can have it.
4630 2018-12-19 02:10:38 Trump banned bump stocks.

Lmao.

Hows that Trumpy doin, Republicans?

4632 2018-12-19 02:10:20 Thank you @realDonaldTrump for following through on promise to ban bump stocks.
4633 2018-12-19 02:10:20 Bear Market-SP 2200 on deck!  I’ve warned for a year.  Stocks declined as fast as any period I can remember.  People crushed already!  I hope we go down 300 SP in a day
4634 2018-12-19 02:10:18 Oh yea, that’s what I thought when they went after bump stocks
Trump has not been the 2a president he promised to be
Bottom line, this is what the dems do, they chip & chip away at #2a until there’s nothing left
Then the real fun begins
Control
4635 2018-12-19 02:10:15 So the @nra folks all said they’d revolt against the government if the President infringed on their rights. Well Trump just took away your bump stocks...so GO FOR IT!!! C’mon folks show up at the White House. Ha! Oh and by the way @dloesch is quite about Russia $ laundering ha ha

4639 2018-12-19 02:09:33 Crypto stocks will see another big rally. Likely after families get together for the holidays and talk each other into bailing. Those who haven't already. Too much money to be made for big money to not come back. $BTC bounce coming, at minimum a gnarly dead cat, agree.

    U.S. stocks held near a 14-month low on a volatile day that saw the benchmark gauge swing almost 2 percent from trough to peak.

4648 2018-12-19 02:08:41 Asian stocks traded mixed Wednesday following a volatile U.S. session that saw stocks end the day flat and crude oil slump more than 7 percent.

4651 2018-12-19 02:07:56 @realDonaldTrump  Well, the liberals got their way with bump stocks, the wall, illegal voters. They will drive this country because nobody, including you, will stand up. Republicans never, ever fight. Disappointed.
4652 2018-12-19 02:07:54 If the Trump administration starts shooting white dudes that won’t turn in their bump stocks he has my vote in 2020.

4655 2018-12-19 02:07:45 The DOJ has reviewed whether or not the bump stocks fell into illegal or legal categories previously and they were continually ruled as legal.  So today's ruling is a surprise.
4656 2018-12-19 02:07:33 @realDonaldTrump So you bend over for some nutt ball about bumb stocks , they got you there, how can we trust you about total gun ownership , we hired you to abide by our constitution period!

4660 2018-12-19 02:06:27 There is no law on the books that gives the Feds the authority to ban bump stocks.  This new EO is making it up out thin air.  I agree Bump Stocks should be banned, but Congress will need to pass a new law if it's going to stick at the Federal Level.
4661 2018-12-19 02:06:00 After LV the legislature could not pass a law, so some politicians figured out how to do it through the DOJ.  For whatever reason, both parties agreed about getting rid of the bump stocks after that event.The DOJ reviewed the rule for the fifth or sixth time, today chgd its mind.
4662 2018-12-19 02:05:56 bump stocks are finally banned
4663 2018-12-19 02:05:41 Just like BHO couldn’t pass Obamacare, but did, Trump has a pen and a phone. Idk your attachment to bump stocks, I am pro 2A and against most anything they propose, but Trump can ban with a pen. You are allowed not to like it.
4664 2018-12-19 02:05:37 Democrats call for a bump stock ban and the GOP goes batsh*t crazy — DJT and the DOJ change the regulation outlawing bump stocks by classifying them as machine guns and the GOP stays silent.  Political posturing...*sigh*
4665 2018-12-19 02:05:13 Actually the problem is the person not the gun which would make banning bump stocks pointless. It speaks to a greater liberal agenda that most people are just not down with but you already knew that 
4666 2018-12-19 02:04:46 Dear Susan
Do you really think the bump stock thing is gonna solve it? Seriously? Once you and your do-nothing pals ban the bump stocks, suddenly all mass shootings will cease? How about actually getting behind a law that alters our gun control. Period. Scared?
4667 2018-12-19 02:04:18 Banning bump stocks is like throwing chairs off the Titanic so you'll sink slower.
4668 2018-12-19 02:04:17 How does it reduce violence Mr Kasich?  Ppl aren’t running thru the streets with bump stocks.  The weapon of choice is normally a simple hand gun.  I guess appearances matter more than substance.
4669 2018-12-19 02:04:17 Really? The President just order the confiscation or destruction of personal property without compensation. Bump-stocks were legal when purchased. The only legal justification for the NFA was as a transfer tax, It didn't effect firearms until they were sold.
4670 2018-12-19 02:04:17 Everywhere bump stocks have been banned either the state passed a new law to ban them or there was an existing law that allowed for a ban to be issued by executive order or through a regulatory change.
4671 2018-12-19 02:04:05 never expect a child to go from 0-18 in 1 yr,never expect to lose weight and sustain in a short time,'rome was not built in a day's,then why do we fucking expect companies to grow million Xs and stocks and economies to grow so steeply.They will fall - hard like my diet!
4672 2018-12-19 02:03:46 Trump banned bump stocks 
4673 2018-12-19 02:03:15 Because gun owners could care less about bump stocks. A knowledgable gun owner can make the modification themselves to do the same thing as a bump stock.
4674 2018-12-19 02:02:48 Maybe he is gonna build a wall put of bump stocks
4675 2018-12-19 02:02:18 Bump Stocks are a gun club toy! They are not conducive to accurate fire and are a waste of ammo! Just Fun at the range!
4676 2018-12-19 02:02:16 You just said loud and clear that you don’t give a shit about gun rights and the constitution as a whole giving power to exe. branch You have no authority to direct the ATF to ban and reclassify bump stocks as machine guns, because Congress passed that definition. 26 USC 5845(b)
4677 2018-12-19 02:02:09 Then let us now do, what we did in the 80-90s w/So Africa. Call on all CITIZENS to DIVEST from all stocks in companies and boycott product in protest of Israeli APARTHEID

Starting and maintaining a citizens boycott of Israeli invested US and foreign companies IS NOT OUTLAWED
4678 2018-12-19 02:02:02 It sounds just like day-traders squabbling over pump-and-dump penny stocks.
4679 2018-12-19 02:01:59 It's not about bump stocks it's about the government being able to make you a criminal overnight and stealing your property
4680 2018-12-19 02:01:19 When you consider that energy stocks didn’t buy into oil’s brief rally in late summer and early fall anyway, and you survey the wreckage in gasoline refining margins, it’s hard to escape the thought that demand may deserve more attention than supply.
4681 2018-12-19 02:01:11 I think given the guidance, low unemployment, rising wages, consumer strength, and Trump's pressure, they're going to go through with it w/ some more dovish language- my guess is stocks drop and rebound after the decision.  Def time to lighten up though
4682 2018-12-19 02:00:52 If the GOP truly wanted to ban bump stocks, they would simply pass legislation. Instead they pull this smokescreen knowing it will be tied up in the courts for years. 

Republicans are terrified to take even a vote on bump stocks.
4683 2018-12-19 02:00:28 Very interesting that this week the two Senate Intel reports released, Flynn not sentenced, Trump Foundation dissolved, multi-investigations including DJTJr & Ivanka, indictments dropped on @GenFlynn biz associates. Now @NRA & @GOP support ban on bump stocks! @CNNPolitics
4684 2018-12-19 02:00:27 People will camp in lines for days to get a chance to return thoses evil bump stocks. Did President 0bama ok these bump stocks.
4685 2018-12-19 02:00:08 Because it does nothing by itself? Just like a bullet does nothing by itself, they only become a problem when they are in guns, just like bump stocks. Was that not clear? Do I need to spell it out for you?
4686 2018-12-19 01:59:54 "I never of bump stocks but I am engaged they banned them". That sounds about right for a repubtard
4687 2018-12-19 01:59:05 We lost our bump stocks in a boating accident. It was so sad. They went down with all our high capacity magazines.

Trump’s America is crumbling like an earthquake, and we’re all losing healthcare, stocks, interest rate, pollution, etc., and our standing in the world is diminishing daily!!
4704 2018-12-19 01:56:04 He has no idea most of what hes talking about is cosmetic. Who cares if it's a pistol or a rifle both should be legal, you have to get a tax stamp if you put a brace on a pistol. Bump stocks are dumb meaningless

4709 2018-12-19 01:55:05 So how do you enforce if you don’t set a deadline to turn in? If you deem bump stocks to be unsafe, you have to have some sort of collection.
4710 2018-12-19 01:55:03 Of course I did, but I was replying to Barbara who seemed to be wondering how many people have died from firearms equipped with bump stocks since Vegas. I'm not aware of any.

4713 2018-12-19 01:54:34 I don’t have a problem with a ban on Bump Stocks, but I have a MAJOR problem with the confiscation of anything obtained legally.

4719 2018-12-19 01:52:48 This is hilarious, bump stocks don’t do shit, any real gun owner knows this. That “madman” in Vegas would have killed just as many with out it. Stop using this as a high platform for your bullshit.

4739 2018-12-19 01:49:33 @realDonaldTrump Thank you for banning bump stocks.
4740 2018-12-19 01:49:28 I hope all of you that support the Banning of bump stocks realize how stupid it is. You can do the same thing with a piece of string and a stick. It's amazing how many laws are born out of ignorance.....
4741 2018-12-19 01:49:06 Bump stocks are a goofy cartoonish simulation of full auto. Stupid and useless. But as deserving of Constitutional protection as Tom and Jerry.
4742 2018-12-19 01:48:49 Yea but to do business with China they have to ban porn in order to welcome a bigger crowd so of course yanks hate porn it’s all for business not the interest of the people. Also the tech stocks are down so their forced to do something drastic. Look what happened to blizzard.
4743 2018-12-19 01:48:33 The government orginally approved these bump stocks if the want to ban them the need to buy them back at full market value. The Constitution and Bill of Rights forbid the government from taking someone property without compensation.
4744 2018-12-19 01:48:31 Guess I better get more stocks in grits
4745 2018-12-19 01:48:12 No thank you, my stocks are already broken
4746 2018-12-19 01:48:11 Actually, I don't think that's accurate. I said that same thing to my nephews & they disagreed and showed me video of them shooting their guns with bump stocks. And they're very pro gun!
4747 2018-12-19 01:47:58 The gun lobby is suing to stop the ban on bump stocks.  Some people just don't know when to quit,---even after Vegas.
4748 2018-12-19 01:47:43 Trump bans Bump stocks today. Pelosi gets private gun sales banned next year. 2020 president comes in and adds new, common sense gun legislation.

Future looks bright.
4749 2018-12-19 01:47:36 @realDonaldTrump the stocks are on track for the worst December performance since The Great Depression. Very BAD.
4750 2018-12-19 01:47:30 December na naman LUXXE PRODUCTS onhand stocks po ulit tayo..PM PO FOR ORDERS, ALSO MAY OFFER AKO SA INYO RAK NA..we ship nationwide and intetnational.
4751 2018-12-19 01:47:25 Oh. Maybe bump stocks are good then?
4752 2018-12-19 01:45:50 The operative phrase they are law abiding. So the criminals will be the only people with bump stocks and we the law abiding Americans will be considered criminals. This is a dangerous country especially now that the President may not shut down the government.
4753 2018-12-19 01:45:21 cause stocks are casual, real fighting games have health
4754 2018-12-19 01:45:03 Apparently, you know nothing about Obama. Yet, Trump enjoyed riding the Obama wave till about... now. Look what's happening to us now? Are you watching the stock market, how about the auto industry that Obama saved? It's going under now, stocks, layoffs, shutdowns.
4755 2018-12-19 01:44:37 I'm a gun owner and carry a concealed weapon everyday. Bump stocks have no sporting value or self protection value.  I have 30+ rounds on me, if I can't protect myself, my family and possibly others with that I shouldn't be carrying. Gotta agree to the ban.
4756 2018-12-19 01:44:34 Can a high powered scope turn a relative novice marksman into a sniper? I'm not saying banning bump stocks is wrong but I think this could potentially lead to bans on all kinds of firearm accessories. Could have unforeseen consequences throughout the industry
4757 2018-12-19 01:44:18 GOLD COUNCIL stocks slump
4758 2018-12-19 01:43:35 These bump stocks were approve by the Government and legally purchased therefore the government should be required to pay the full market price for each bump stock. For the record I have no use for bump stocks. But taking America citizens property without compensation is illegal.
4759 2018-12-19 01:43:34 Banning bump stocks Saying Damn the Wall...Backing Off The Shutdown ...Anybody Checked Trumps Temperature?
4760 2018-12-19 01:42:53 @realDonaldTrump I hope you know that since you have banned bump stocks you’ve essentially ruined any chances for a second term
4761 2018-12-19 01:42:31 Because the language went way beyond bump stocks.  Everyone even the NRA was on board regarding banning bump stocks but the anti 2A crowd over played their hand....their fault...
4762 2018-12-19 01:41:04 Bump stocks banned!
This is a beginning, beginning of some common sense checks.
4763 2018-12-19 01:40:51 1/ Weren't bump stocks were made legal under Obama to help handicap people shoot easier? 2/ Saying they expect law abiding citizens to turn the bump stocks in means they know criminals won't turn theirs in. 3/ And it goes against the taking of property for safety reasons.
4764 2018-12-19 01:40:24 I notice Cameron: that you did NOT say anything about OUR President Donald  Trump signing a law to "BAN Bump Stocks" to make it illegal for regular citizens  to obtain? Ya, this ruling happened TODAY.  [I just found it strange that you are silent on this ].
4765 2018-12-19 01:40:18 Nothing on you & your unconstitutionally appointed AG signing off on the ban of bump stocks today? That's strange. I figured your base would love that news. Or are you worried that your base would challenge the legitimacy & legality of a non appointed AG creating laws?
4766 2018-12-19 01:40:02 Best preferred rules is 3 stocks, 3 minutes, camp with villager
4767 2018-12-19 01:39:32 He only did it because he thinks bumping stocks are part of the NYSE.

4769 2018-12-19 01:39:08 Mr. President there is the problem with you ban on bump stocks, the government is trying to take property of America citizens without due compensation this is a violation of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. These bump stocks were legally purchased and were legal at the time.
4770 2018-12-19 01:38:58 Thanks to @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse administration for the latest regulations limiting bump stocks. Hopefully a step towards making our country safer
4771 2018-12-19 01:38:16 @CNBC welcome fox business network because of the lack of being transparent on cnbc.  take the politics out of your shows unless you are going to be honest.  stocks crashed when dems got back in control.  taxes will be raised!  that is the issue...
4772 2018-12-19 01:38:06 Any real gun owner/connoisseur would tell you that bump stocks a sh*t, they can easily ruin your rifle & any one who actually cares ab their firearm wouldn’t put one on it to begin with so folks on the right wont care bc 99.9% were never looking to get one to begin with
4773 2018-12-19 01:36:52 @KingKhari88 sup khari, I tweeted you bout a month or so back saying I ran into your videos from 2016 on stocks....I'm just wondering more about how much you started with and how much did you make before you took break. Your vids pushed me to jump in with others people influence
4774 2018-12-19 01:36:33 Very few care about bump stocks. Many care about the way it's being implemented. Confiscation needs to be off the table whether paid or uncompensated.
4775 2018-12-19 01:36:30 A big thanks to the Trump administration and the collaborative effort from the White House to ban bump stocks.

4778 2018-12-19 01:36:17 Trump: 

No repeal on Obamacare 

No wall

Still giving billions in foreign aid

Bans bump stocks

Raised taxes on imports

Still running 1 trillion $ deficits 

Didn’t realize I voted for a Democrat.
4779 2018-12-19 01:36:00 no..i avoid hot stocks in that list
4780 2018-12-19 01:35:11 OK, so I just heard that Trump has signed a Bump Stock ban into law. Not an overly big deal, even the NRA felt that Bump Stocks were a bad thing. Though they thought an outright ban wasn't the way to go. But it did get me to thinking about something else.

4782 2018-12-19 01:34:27 I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest in the security of the citizens. I'm simply saying this "bump stocks" controversy is all BS. Bump stocks are not the issue. People are the issue. Imagine if that dude had stollen a Peterbuilt and driven thru the crowd.
4783 2018-12-19 01:34:14 @realDonaldTrump Well Donald, bump stocks banned. Kiss my ass. 

This is why you did not get my vote.

Btw, I am sure the wall will not get built.
4784 2018-12-19 01:33:55 You know that hardly anybody sold bump stocks and even fewer bought them, right? . #gimmick #classIIInfa
4785 2018-12-19 01:33:51 I liked hearing how others have started to build off of the architecture, personalizing it for their needs.  The waiting to make announcements was also key. I think you will see several companies all announce at once in 2019...and stocks will zoom.
4786 2018-12-19 01:32:59 Anything about Bump Stocks ?? 
Can you imagine if Obama did this ??

4791 2018-12-19 01:31:13 Hear that? That’s the sound of literally no one destroying their bump stocks.
4792 2018-12-19 01:31:08 Hahaha bump stocks is what led you to downgrade Trump? Bump stocks? 
Incredible
4793 2018-12-19 01:30:56 the stock markets are down people are bailing because of what this man is doing he is going to destroy your nation your stocks will be worthless and he will just smile and walk away and say screw you
4794 2018-12-19 01:30:43 Dear moron. The reason is simple. The rule against bump stocks is so poorly worded that they can make any trigger upgrade and any semi autos illegal.
4795 2018-12-19 01:30:37 Petco Employee Stocks Gerbils By The Cash Register For Impulse Purchases. SAD!
4796 2018-12-19 01:30:09 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump No Wall corruption everywhere you didn’t and haven’t declassified anything you’re worried about our bump stocks. You need to do something Mr. President people Have had about enough.
4797 2018-12-19 01:30:05 Well, technically, you didn’t vote republican, and they banned bump stocks.
4798 2018-12-19 01:29:20 Me too considering pot stocks are kicking my ass but I’ve been in USD since a year ago so 
4799 2018-12-19 01:29:15 question re: surrendering/destroying bump stocks within 90 days. is there already a registry of people who own bump stocks? if not, does this regulation have any teeth?
4800 2018-12-19 01:28:56 Lighten up Francis. Banning an accessory that 90% of the people knew nothing about until Vegas is silly. Hell, I bet half the people who have bump stocks have no idea how to use them correctly. Fight when it’s worth fighting.
4801 2018-12-19 01:28:47 Fuck bump stocks that’s small potatoes.  #banallgunsbanthemnow #opentheborderscompletely
4802 2018-12-19 01:28:45 Do you know a company stocks go up when they lay off staff? Did you know the red just raised rates and are talking about raising again?
4803 2018-12-19 01:28:41 Good work on Trump admin. for banning bump stocks.
4804 2018-12-19 01:28:31 RIP bump stocks. @realDonaldTrump you are a pussy who cracks under pressure. Every gun law is an infringement
4805 2018-12-19 01:28:25 Remember that time Obama took your bump stocks?
4806 2018-12-19 01:27:42 They are playing games. They need 1 or 2 hours. They got big bucks. We need a day or two. So following the market up sale low buy.  Me $0.40 c.    Sale too I don't care make$$$ I'm ok. With cheap stocks..
4807 2018-12-19 01:27:31 In this case they should have added Machine guns manufactured after 84 are illegal, which all bump stocks are.
4808 2018-12-19 01:27:20 $VPOR is a “horse” that I am still embarrassing holding however nothing significant. Keeping it around just as a learning experience really. I’ve never been a fan of penny stocks but thought that this one may have had some legs ... letting it ride.

4810 2018-12-19 01:26:59 Because who actually gives a shit about bump stocks?
4811 2018-12-19 01:26:30 Do you still support Trump even though you have to get rid of all your bump stocks? We know you are such a badass with guns.
4812 2018-12-19 01:26:18 "On track for worst December market since the great depression" Of course! Huge Wealth's Trump/GOP tax cut drove market up; Now dumping stocks driving market down, etc.. @AP @WSJ @nytimes @washingtonpost Fuck Trump/GOP and Democrat Plutocrats! @GOP @DNC @ResistanceParty
4813 2018-12-19 01:26:14 You're right. And I was mistaken on bump stocks. However, I've dealt with about 4 instances of threats over my 5 years in education. Even if it's a small ban on something that can be used in a shooting, I'm all for it.
4814 2018-12-19 01:26:08 Bump stocks and then this. Donnie acting like an adult today? What is happening?
4815 2018-12-19 01:26:05 @realDonaldTrump yo now that bump stocks are illegal, can you ban furries too? 

Thanks Prez,
Ya Boi
4816 2018-12-19 01:26:00 Gonna hold onto the gas stocks?
4817 2018-12-19 01:25:51 Bump stocks made legal under Obama
4818 2018-12-19 01:25:17 Banning bump stocks won’t save a single life. But looks like it’s going to happen.
4819 2018-12-19 01:24:39 Wow! You really are not a forward thinker are you? Does appeasement ever work? This is not about the silly Bump stocks, it’s about the the presidency it sets and illegal law creation.
4820 2018-12-19 01:24:36 Don't look at him to get the stocks. W B. Can get EPS. He's always got big bucks not us. He poured$$ to Oracle to make ER. He got $2.75/share. We got stocks down. That's B.S.    u got me Mr??¿ Don't follow them. I can sale every day. Good or I sale tomorrow. I don't keep

4822 2018-12-19 01:24:20 But don’t you need the apps to track your stocks like trade ideas? Or you only using free tools?
4823 2018-12-19 01:24:10 The Left Is Giving #IndividualNumber1 props for Banning bump stocks, and the right is all up in arms....
4824 2018-12-19 01:24:07 I think Judicial Watch should join @GunOwners in the lawsuit filed on the ATF & DOJ for trying to rewrite laws classifying bump stocks as machine guns. Clear constitutional violation. Gov agencies can't just change something making 1/2 million into felons.
4825 2018-12-19 01:24:05 Remember, everyone, it was the traitors at the @NRA who initiated the call to ban bump-fire stocks.
4826 2018-12-19 01:23:27 Hey want to ban "bump-stocks" because of Las Vegas, but as of yet have STILL not explained what happened, who was involved, what was the motive, etc., etc. Did someone buy a bump stock and suddenly say, "Hey, I need to go kill people?"
4827 2018-12-19 01:23:09 Yeah. Thanks for a stock market in the toilet,  an astronomical debt, companies starting to lay off workers again, allies that are wary of dealing with us, enemies more determined to defeat us.  More mass shootings and only the bump stocks taken away. Yup, a great job- psych!
4828 2018-12-19 01:23:02 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President why did you ask the ATF to classify bump stocks as machine guns? When you campaigned for President you said the 2nd amendment doesn't have any bigger supporter than you. Please prove that now and rescind the unlawful order by the ATF

4831 2018-12-19 01:22:39 Trump may be hitting some rough sledding this month but you can't deny that he made some progress on gun control, with this new ban on bump stocks

gun control

progress
4832 2018-12-19 01:22:36 There was a better one - which allowed you to pass behind the net, gave the center a curved track for stick handling, had a peg for an extra man in front of the opposing goal, and real stocks for the players. Spent hours with that game!
4833 2018-12-19 01:22:15 I give homie stocks all the time. None of them are intentional.

All in one day:

1. Bans bump stocks
2. Loses argument in court re Flynn
3. Backs down over shutdown
4. Trump foundation shuttered
4837 2018-12-19 01:21:37 I’m a die-hard defender of 2nd Am. and the owner of an AR (Windham Weaponry - a terrific rifle).
But bump stocks are a loophole to bypass the full-auto restrictions we have had in place since the 1930’s.  As such I support their prohibition.
4838 2018-12-19 01:21:17 @realDonaldTrump where is the tweet about Bump-stocks Prez? Come on you actually helped something that is good are you afraid of your base & NRA.
4839 2018-12-19 01:21:12 What is going on...all good things but from this admin...are we being punked? 

1) Yemeni National given a visa to visit her dying son.
2) Admin banned bump stocks.
3) Backtracking on wall rhetoric, will “work” with Congress.


4840 2018-12-19 01:21:00 Thank you Mr Trump; most of us experiencing 18-20 plus percent downs! High Tech has been poisoned lately so might have to rely on 10.00 dividend stocks soon.
4841 2018-12-19 01:20:55 Trump “don’t worry about the second amendment it’s totally protected with me”. ..... three minutes later bans bump stocks.... hmmm
4842 2018-12-19 01:20:30 I’m waiting for the “stocks” gift tweets 
4843 2018-12-19 01:20:28 Is cloud the new bitcoin? Or marijuana? I'm so out of the loop these days. Should we ignore the recent declines of chip stocks? Buy $SOXL?
4844 2018-12-19 01:20:16 Fuck your bump stocks.
4845 2018-12-19 01:20:12 Gawd! That wa aimed st the trumpie bashing this! I’m on board! It was in the thread. I usually don’t reply to explain but this is big for me too! We need to keep these bump stocks out of people’s hands. Mea cults for the misunderstanding. It was aimed at the trumpie
4846 2018-12-19 01:19:52 What if we build a wall out of the bump stocks?
4847 2018-12-19 01:19:50 So President Trump put a ban on bump stocks. Great job President

4853 2018-12-19 01:17:18 You aren't looking at the big picture here, this isn't about saving bump stocks, this is about saving what little we have left of the 2nd amendment,  as it's getting chipped away daily!  What will they ban next?  Do you want this to set a precedence?
4854 2018-12-19 01:17:13 @RobinhoodApp I lost $2000 in my small account of robinhood due to their glich on last Wednesday.

4855 2018-12-19 01:16:57 1 bump stocks don’t kill people, neither do guns. 

2americans across the country are waitin for your balls to drop so you test them. Tyrant.
4856 2018-12-19 01:16:53 actually 2 NRA members came out against bump stocks
4857 2018-12-19 01:16:31 Agree. No bump stocks.

Now, why did you accept a bribe to ignore the Trump University lawsuits?
4858 2018-12-19 01:16:31 Isn't this something that Obama made legal and now Trump is Banning bump stocks? I would think you should make a caricature of yourself and say confusion in Paradise
4859 2018-12-19 01:16:25 trump clearly in panic mode. 

-Agrees easily to close Foundation.
-Seeks to ban bump stocks.
-Backing down on govt shut-down.

WE DID THIS WHEN WE VOTED. 

We gave Dems the power to pursue justice and that gave Mueller assurance America wants the truth. YOU DID IT 
4860 2018-12-19 01:16:20 I’m not interested in bump stocks. Full auto would melt or warp my barrels. That said, I’m not giving anything up, and those who think the government can deputize police or servicemen to take my firearms better think again.
4861 2018-12-19 01:16:14 Right now the market is based upon headlines and trade war fears, instead of fundamentals. I’m down BIGLY especially for the year, but 401k is still very long term for me, and other investments are quality dividend paying stocks.
4862 2018-12-19 01:15:54 Are you still bullish on stocks and expecting a parabolic melt up? I said many times it was going down. I just hope the air of this balloon comes out slowly.
4863 2018-12-19 01:15:25 Lost my boat. Bumps stocks went looking. Didn't come back. Told them not to go. Stubborn.
4864 2018-12-19 01:15:07 I remember when I first started trading stocks. 

I bought a car in high school without a job and everyone thought it was daddy money. 

I’m no millionaire, but I’m still self-made. 

We all are. 

It’s just that the unsuccessful ones won’t admit it.
4865 2018-12-19 01:15:00 PMB no increase him stocks for farm , forged waec! But saved $2B for NGR with companies folding up & unemployment at world record high! Harvard & Cambridge needs him
4866 2018-12-19 01:14:35 What about the fake conservative who just unconstitutionally banned bump stocks?
4867 2018-12-19 01:14:11 @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks?  Not voting for you again sorry!  What part of shall not be infringed do you not understand?  More censorship and banning bumpstocks under your time.  Losing more freedoms while you're here.  Not cool.
4868 2018-12-19 01:13:58 Hi @StocksNerd I have been watching your profile for a week. I play only with N50. I would love to know how to shortlist your stocks before picking them. I mean there are tens of hundreds of stocks in the market. One cannot screen the stocks one by one or randomly pick one. Rgds
4869 2018-12-19 01:13:54 You ever invest there Mr.Axelrod? What did MSNBC say the night Trump was elected? The markets will crash! Sell your stocks! Any talking head admit to that idiotic comment? Still showing up at that less than CNN ratings disaster? Stop with the fake newsery!
4870 2018-12-19 01:13:29 Heard on NPR that the ban doesn't mean much b/c bump stocks are easily made by ppl with 3-D printers. Empty concession by Trump.
4871 2018-12-19 01:13:21 @LauraAJarrett great news that Trump has banned bump stocks !  Once again another example of Trump doing the right thing even though the NRA is against this.  He continues to protect Americans .  Obama did nothing .
4872 2018-12-19 01:13:16 Bump stocks can be home made how many shootings used them that's right 1 you just want to go after guns you think you get that banned you can keep going and take all our 2nd amendment
4873 2018-12-19 01:12:38 I also dont think there is any practical method to remove bump stocks and there never will be. This just stops the production and sells at this point. I don't think the bump stock model is ever even considered by bad guys.
4874 2018-12-19 01:12:21 Conventional wisdom is to invest in stocks when they're low but too many coaches only care about investing in kids that already have a high value.
4875 2018-12-19 01:12:11 Trump Administration officially bans bump stocks that allow guns to fire more rapidly

4876 2018-12-19 01:11:47 why did it take so long to ban bump stocks...
4877 2018-12-19 01:11:37 Trying to distance himself from the @NRA and their Russian funneled cash...look - NO COLLUSION - I banned bump stocks.
4878 2018-12-19 01:11:36 European stocks fell on Tuesday amid escalating concerns about a slowing global economy.
4879 2018-12-19 01:11:16 I'm sorry. My original definition was incorrect. Bump stocks cause the trigger to bump the rounds and fire faster.

4881 2018-12-19 01:10:53 I'm so proud of every person who had a hand in making Bump Stocks band. #WeAreNotDonYet #FirstOfMany #NeverAgain #BumpStockBan
4882 2018-12-19 01:10:50 Maybe Trump thought it said Dump Stocks. 

He thought he was forcing the market up by banning sales?
4883 2018-12-19 01:10:28 Losing GSP cuz of an idiot with bad connection and 2 stocks as his preferred rules, I jump off to end the unplayable game and I lose ranking lol ok
4884 2018-12-19 01:10:27 "Bump stocks"  They banned devices that "increase the firing rate of semiautomatic weapons"  But they fail to realize that "bump firing" is a technique, not a device.  It can be done with your belt loop.
4885 2018-12-19 01:10:18 stocks making a comeback included @GoldmanSachs, which gained 1.8% to snap a nine-day losing streak related to the Malaysian state fund @1MDB scandal, and Johnson & Johnson, which added 1.4% after a 13% drop over two days.
4886 2018-12-19 01:10:16 Psst... buy ALL the stocks. I’d bet my left asscheek the space launch industry will get a kick in the bank account if this follows through.
4887 2018-12-19 01:10:13 I agree bump stocks are dumb but they should be protected by the second amendment end of story
4888 2018-12-19 01:10:00 help this guy named luke is playing with 2 stocks omegas
4889 2018-12-19 01:09:58 Bump stocks are a waste of money.  I can replicate it with my belt loop,  SMH.  Ban them.  Makes no difference.
4890 2018-12-19 01:09:58 What is bump stocks
4891 2018-12-19 01:09:41 Credit where credit is due: I'm very happy to see bump-stocks banned... Thank you, President Probable Cause!
4892 2018-12-19 01:09:31 US stocks rose on Tuesday, with the major indexes fluctuating wildly before closing in positive territory, as fears over sluggish global growth and US-China trade relations eased somewhat
4893 2018-12-19 01:09:24 @realDonaldTrump I backed you financially and politically. Your treachery regarding bump stocks will not be forgotten. Reverse this ruling and stop eroding the 2nd amendment!
4894 2018-12-19 01:08:48 Trump admin bans bump stocks.
4895 2018-12-19 01:08:35 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, sir, I have never had a desire to own a "bump stock"....until today. What part of "shall not be infringed" is not clear enough? Stocks are not the problem; sin and evil are the problem. The answer you seek is in the book you were sworn in on.
4896 2018-12-19 01:08:15 How much spittle would be emanating from the @NRA if the Hillary Clinton Administration started confiscating bump-stocks? #NRA #GunSense

4899 2018-12-19 01:07:55 It doesn't directly, but bump stocks modify the amount of shells in a magazine, thereby causing a shooter to have to reload more frequently and allowing more time for people to get away.
4900 2018-12-19 01:07:55 Mr. President everytime somethings happens in this country the stocks drop. It is dropping too low sir.
4901 2018-12-19 01:07:08 Right to bear arms?? I see no where In there where it says you need to turn a semi auto weapon into almost a fully automatic.. I support owning guns 100% and also support having semi automatic assault rifles, but I see no need for bump stocks. They are unnecessary.
4902 2018-12-19 01:06:44 Someone told me that even if Trump's administration did something I liked I wouldn't give him credit. Wrong. He announced he's banning bump stocks. Good job. Thank you Donnie Boy. You're still awful. Stopped clock is right twice a day, and you're halfway through your term.
4903 2018-12-19 01:06:23 The Obama administration thought banning Bump Stocks was "too extreme" and didn't do it.

But Trump did.

Narrator: Neither party knew how to properly react.
4904 2018-12-19 01:06:07 My stocks really went up this year , next year imma invest in my first apartment building and see where that goes.
4905 2018-12-19 01:05:59 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President I will be upfront and say I am not one of your supporters.   But as a lifetime gun owner and shooter I commend you and your administration for banning bump-stocks.  These devices have no legitimate place in civilian hands.  Kudos.
4906 2018-12-19 01:05:16 Boss I have investments in stocks, real estate. Me and wife pay tax in India and file tax returns. So I have a non voting stake in the direction in which the country is going. INR depreciated about 50-55% during MMS. INR is the most stable currency with very high real interest.
4907 2018-12-19 01:05:05 Huh, the Trump Administration just banned bump stocks.  Like, no grandfathering, you have 90 days to destroy or turn in your bump stock or you're committing a crime.

That's the tallest anyone's stood against the NRA since Clinton.  Trump, of all people!
4908 2018-12-19 01:04:39 Not sure why you haven't informed your member followers about the new law concerning bump stocks. Are you in shock? Or just pretending? Maybe you were hoping to make bump stocks mandatory for preschool guards.
4909 2018-12-19 01:04:32 Trump banned bump stocks...An action I can finally get behind
4910 2018-12-19 01:04:28 "Trump verbiedt 'bump stocks', waarmee geweren veranderen in mitrailleurs"
4911 2018-12-19 01:04:25 Hey dipshit. As far as ‘taking our guns’, banning bump stocks has about the same affect as banning holsters. Which would be zero.
4912 2018-12-19 01:04:08 timed with items on hazards on all stages is definitely 3 stocks 7 mins no items bf
4913 2018-12-19 01:03:58 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, sir, I've never had a desire to own a "bump stock"....until today. What part of "shall no be infringed" is not clear enough? Stocks are not the issue. Sin and evil are the issue. The answer you seek is on the pages of the book you were sworn in on.
4914 2018-12-19 01:03:46 It is about damn time Trump banned the Bump Stocks. Now let’s see if the ban stands, gets enforced and punishment is handed out if the law is broken!
4915 2018-12-19 01:03:45 You don’t need bump stocks. They have no use for hunting/protection purposes. The only purpose is for recreational use. It’s a good move all around.
4916 2018-12-19 01:02:55 Thanks, @NRA, for your hard work making sure all those Russian sleeper agents have all the guns they need, complete with full auto sears and bump stocks, and insane amounts of ammo.
4917 2018-12-19 01:02:11 Gubament banned bump stocks today.
4918 2018-12-19 01:01:51 @cenkuygur will you guys cover the bump stocks ban tomorrow?
4919 2018-12-19 01:01:47 The other thing to consider is that this is the first time in a long time that gun policy has been outright confiscatory. This new rule will require owners of bump stocks to turn them in to law enforcement or destroy them.
4920 2018-12-19 01:01:44 There are other devices just as effective as bump stocks that were not banned. We will always be 10 steps ahead of the hand wringers and banners.
4921 2018-12-19 01:01:41 The Dow and S&P 500 are both in the red for the year, putting stocks on track to have their worst annual loss since the 2008 Great Recession — and first annual loss since 2015.
4922 2018-12-19 01:01:38 Thank you for banning bump stocks. Now do more to make schools safer (arming teachers is not part of the solution)
4923 2018-12-19 01:01:32 This definitely faces some pretty strenuous ex post facto examination.  Especially since the manufacturers of bump stocks sought and received a ruling on bump stocks before offering them for sale.  The reclassification of the devices as machine guns puts the 1986 law in doubt too
4924 2018-12-19 01:01:30 How do you feel about the Trump admin banning bump stocks?
4925 2018-12-19 01:01:20 Someone surely lied and told Trump, that President Obama was 'for Bump Stocks'!

No other explanation is viable.
4926 2018-12-19 01:01:11 Banning bump stocks, when (fully automatic) machine guns are already illegal, is a no-brainer.

Where is the lobby for RESPONSIBLE gun ownership?

Where does the gun lobby stand on 3D-printed guns?
4927 2018-12-19 01:01:04 Investing in stocks is an art, not a science, and people who've been trained to rigidly quantify everything have a big disadvantage. All the math you need in the stock market you get in the fourth grade. Peter Lynch
4928 2018-12-19 01:00:54 Bump stocks serve no practical purpose and are essentially toys. However, it is interesting to note that the candidate promoted by the NRA is the one that said "I like taking guns away early [...] Take the guns first, go through due process second."
4929 2018-12-19 01:00:18 Anyone know how bump stocks got the ban from trump today?
4930 2018-12-19 00:59:58 Does imPotus IQ45 have to climax while conversing with Vlad the Impaler to qualify for Breach of Britches Treason?!
Tie Scum-P in the stocks and let the world have at him!  Covfefe!
4931 2018-12-19 00:59:23 Oh lol @realDonaldTrump actually banned Bump Stocks? Good.
4932 2018-12-19 00:59:07 @POTUS Your order to ban bump stocks is really not the answer or solution to the firearm issue, this is a Mental Health issue. 20,000 + laws on the books and your solution is taking the bump stock... wrong choice sir.
4933 2018-12-19 00:59:04 I was an expert marksman in the USAF, former hunter, & I currently own handguns, shotguns & rifles of various configurations & calibers. I have a lifelong personal & professional familiarity with firearms that gives me insight into why civilians don’t need things like bump stocks
4934 2018-12-19 00:59:00 Criminalizing bump stocks is maybe okay but don't be a damn snitch smh
4935 2018-12-19 00:58:59 @realDonaldTrump @ChatByCC @Lrihendry @LindaSuhler I agree to the ban on bump stocks. I'm an NRA member.
4936 2018-12-19 00:58:50 Stocks looking mixed in after-market trading #investing #futures #stocks #StockMarket #StockMarketNews
4937 2018-12-19 00:58:48 It is small part of the problem that people are going to celebrate hard due to their own ignorance, because of the Florida shooting and the fact that one of the videos around that, that went viral mentioned bump stocks. It'll help a little bit, but it doesn't help the core issue
4938 2018-12-19 00:58:38 Defensive stocks were sold...see $HSY, $CLX, $VZ, $PEP...just to name a few.
4939 2018-12-19 00:58:36 Your man buffet knows it best, only buy back stock when there is no better investment. Why stocks droping like a rock....I think there are! This only serves to prop end year bonus
4940 2018-12-19 00:58:30 So we're going to buy some stocks and my mom banging on the door saying I hurry up taking a bath. Hehehez nope gonna finish all LM5 songs while a take a bath 
4941 2018-12-19 00:58:04 Out-of-control caretaker stocks up on Jeff Goldblum
4942 2018-12-19 00:57:54 The @GOP(e) never fails to fail: WH and both chambers of Congress for 2 years, PP fully funded, illegals funded, bump stocks banned, Wall not funded (most likely won’t be). It’s time for a new party.
4943 2018-12-19 00:57:52 Which major gun manufacturer that pays the NRA to lobby for them manufactured bump stocks?
4944 2018-12-19 00:57:26 Glad you outlawed bump stocks makes me more cash cause I manufacture these among other things for firearms that are banned but mine are legal   punk 
4945 2018-12-19 00:57:25 also from the sound of the video there's also a special trigger you can get to do the same thing as a bump stock so banning bump stocks doesn't even ban all the non-diy ways to get the same effect
4946 2018-12-19 00:57:01 Pip traders, day traders, shorters and all those wannabes that can't afford to buy shares outright - go and get stuffed! You have stuffed the market and I wish that you stuff yourselves up right royally. Grow a pair. Stick to Lotto and leave the stocks to real people.
4947 2018-12-19 00:55:52 The Trump Adminstration has successfully banned bump stocks. The world has gotten slightly better.
4948 2018-12-19 00:55:29 Today bump stocks were made illegal. Thank God @MCHammer 1994 hit “Pumps And A Bump” is still legal!
4949 2018-12-19 00:55:17 I have TOO much makeup, I can give away some & still have a lot  I got stocks on stocks
4950 2018-12-19 00:55:09 Eliminating bumb stocks, that’s it??? About as effective as your thoughts and prayers!!
4951 2018-12-19 00:55:01 The trend is downward in all revenue avenues. TLJ barely beat Rogue One in home-video sales, TFA did more in it's first week of home-release than TLJ has so far. Toys/merch sales all plummeted in the wake of TLJ. Disney stocks went down between TLJ and SOLO, worth billions.
4952 2018-12-19 00:54:46 Agreed. Bump stocks just make it easier to kill en masse. No hunter worth his salt would use one; why does anyone need one?
4953 2018-12-19 00:53:47 On track for worst December market since the great depression.

4954 2018-12-19 00:53:34 She wants the Credit after it was us Democrats that have been asking for this before the Las Vegas massacre. It was you REPUBLICANS who were crying 2ndAmendment to keep the bump stocks with the @NRA breathing down DJT throat. Remember that Collins?
4955 2018-12-19 00:53:26 Shows what I know? I asked my husband what Bump Stocks were today, thinking it had to be a financial thing. Like the stock market. He has educated me now.  There are real gaps in my education...
4956 2018-12-19 00:53:24 $SPY Some creative moves on stocks today  :)
4957 2018-12-19 00:53:15 Ban assault rifles. Screw bump stocks.
4958 2018-12-19 00:52:37 Here I thought "Obummer was coming to steel are gums". But it turns out @realDonaldTrump is banning bump stocks. So yeah.
4959 2018-12-19 00:52:18 Second Task... give Goddess a large share of company stocks lol

I am sure someone with the company could be your "in" 

Chastity and dominance will soon sort things out after that 
4960 2018-12-19 00:52:02 Mr. Trump didn't let one of our ambassadors get murdered, didn't sell our uranium stocks for profit, didn't steal from his on charity, used a private server for classified communication, lost over 30K e-mails and hasn't lied under oath. Wake up Brian!
4961 2018-12-19 00:51:53 Hmm. I supposed you can think of like that for stocks I guess.
4962 2018-12-19 00:49:59 They've banned bum stocks thrilled!! Love my President! #BuildTheDamnWall
4963 2018-12-19 00:49:25 It feels right. Now, if they were to lock him in the stocks and pelt him with rancid vegetables...

Still feels right. Traitors have been known to suffer worse. I believe it's Dante's lowest circle in Hell.
4964 2018-12-19 00:49:23 Bump stocks are like putting a giant spoiler and loud exhaust on your Civic... 4 Door
4965 2018-12-19 00:49:04 Unlocked Metaknight on elite by literally just SD'ing all 3 stocks. My GSP for Samus is just that high I can SD as anypne and unlock them. Doesn't feel like an achievement at all.
4966 2018-12-19 00:48:37 Bloomberg reported that Slide Fire, which is the nation's leading manufacturer and sole patent holder of bump stocks, earned more than $10 million in sales in its first year of business.
4967 2018-12-19 00:48:08 That’s great an all the feds banned #BumpStocks but seeing as it’s been over a year and two months since #Route91 with countless “we will ban bump stocks” since. Everyone that wanted one was able to buy one in the year of talking about it.
4968 2018-12-19 00:48:08 Bum stocks are not protected under the Constitution.
4969 2018-12-19 00:48:04 Stocks had a modest rebound today.  No, I don't think Trump supporters should pay for the wall.  And I don't think Hillary supporters should pay to keep Obamacare alive.
4970 2018-12-19 00:47:54 One size never fits all. To assume #MAGA millions who come from all walks of life are all the same is silly. Better question w/b how many law abiding citizens will turn in their bump stocks? ALL OF THEM WILL. Those who don't are NOT law abiding. NOT ALL WILL BE #MAGA folks.
4971 2018-12-19 00:47:11 Don't get me wrong I'm tickled bump stocks are finally banned but why the hell did it take so long?
4972 2018-12-19 00:46:59 Yes & China which is a big investor also pulling stocks

A new generation war against Trump
4973 2018-12-19 00:46:23 Mrs. Groovy made me buy stocks today. She’s less of a wuss than I am.
4974 2018-12-19 00:46:08 If you care this much about holding a CEO responsible, I suggest selling your XRP and buying FAANG stocks.  And in case you haven't noticed, your XRP grew 5 percent while you were whining. Just saying.  Also, I guess I'm the only one that noticed how sexy Monica is? LOL
4975 2018-12-19 00:46:03 In other words, it was the Obama administration's opinion that banning bump stocks was constitutional, but the Article II branch could not do so alone, so it would take the help of the Article I branch, Congress.
4976 2018-12-19 00:45:59 Thank you @realDonaldTrump for finally banning bump stocks! Huge first step, but we still have a long way to go to make our country as safe as possible.
4977 2018-12-19 00:45:25 Slide Fire Solutions, the inventor, patent holder, and leading manufacturer of bump stocks, suspended sales after bump stocks were used in the 2017 Las Vegas shootingand resumed sales a month later. On May 20, 2018, Slide Fire Solutions halted sales and production.
4978 2018-12-19 00:45:13 Only Congress had the power to ban bump stocks, if I obeyed the Constitution.
Presidents and Dark Lords can't change laws.
Silly mortal humans don't understand that I banned bump stocks because I enjoy violating the Constitution by claiming legislative power as mine, mine, MINE!
4979 2018-12-19 00:45:01 @DLoesch bump stocks????????????
4980 2018-12-19 00:45:00 Bump stocks would be illegal but full auto machine guns are legal....that sounds odd? Any  law abiding non felon citizen can legally obtain a full auto firearm.
4981 2018-12-19 00:44:16 "Need" hasn't got a damn thing to do with it.  The 2nd Amendment is a Constitutionally affirmed RIGHT.  An armed citizenry will NEVER have to fight their own government.  Bump stocks are gimmicks but the Govt. doesn't get to change the definition of Semi Vs Full Auto.
4982 2018-12-19 00:44:12 Yo... Bump stocks are actually insane. 

Huh
4983 2018-12-19 00:44:11 $ALB is going through a technical pattern that may bring other lithium stocks down in a dip, not saying it won't go lower but we're getting further and further into a deep undervaluation.

4985 2018-12-19 00:43:38 Only Congresd had the power to ban bump stocks, if I obeyed the Constitution.

Silly mortal, you don't understand that I banned bump stocks because I enjoy violating the Constitution by claiming legislative power as mine, mine, MINE!

4991 2018-12-19 00:42:30 Current administration bans bump stocks. Bad move probably, right?
4992 2018-12-19 00:42:29 The @GOP(e) never fails to fail: WH and both chambers of Congress for 2 years, PP fully funded, illegals funded, bump stocks banned, Wall not funded (most likely won’t be). It’s time for a new party. | #RedNationRising

4994 2018-12-19 00:42:06 Bump stocks, Framers would have added if they'd only known.
4995 2018-12-19 00:41:50 ABSOLUTELY!  How many central banks, sovereign funds and liberal billionaire elites are dumping stocks in unison. @realDonaldTrump enemies have been openly hoping for recession.
4996 2018-12-19 00:41:43 I hung my bump stocks on my Christmas tree as ornaments.
4997 2018-12-19 00:40:42 How many law and order #MAGA will turn in bump stocks? How many law and order folks willing to turn in their belts? Because, prior to bump stocks, belts were used to achieve same results. Can't speak for millions of other #MAGA BUT, I NEVER HAVE FOUND NEED FOR 1.
4998 2018-12-19 00:40:19 S&P 500* lagged by one quarter**

* Because all other indexes including Russel 3000 as proxies for US stocks didn’t curve fit as well

**  Because the half dozen other lag periods including no lag failed to curve fit well
4999 2018-12-19 00:40:10 all my bump stocks were lost in a boating accident. also the makeshift one I built with a car suspension got melted in a fire.
5000 2018-12-19 00:40:07 No civilian needs bump stocks. Why the hell were they allowed to be created and sold in mass. That’s a rhetorical question. ‘Mercia! is why
5001 2018-12-19 00:40:04 Real estate, stocks, startups, acquisitions, AI, businesses, content creation, education, charity, movements, brands....I want it all, on who you can’t be great at anything you put your mind to?

5003 2018-12-19 00:39:53 Only bump stocks were banned
5004 2018-12-19 00:39:43 The wall, or lack there of, bump stocks...just the start of his outreach to a House controlled by Democrats. Art of the deal!
5005 2018-12-19 00:39:27 I don't think this opinion will please anyone, but here it is anyway : banning bump stocks is perfectly fine, but don't expect it to accomplish anything. They're a ridiculous gimmick that doesn't serve any purpose, legitimate or criminal.
5006 2018-12-19 00:39:17 This wouldn’t be about DOJ making law. The courts would rule whether or not the DOJ’s interpretation of bump stocks as de facto machine guns is correct and therefore allowed under current law. In the meantime, Congress could make it a moot point by explicitly banning them.
5007 2018-12-19 00:39:03 Why are you good at trading all kinds of stocks lol
5008 2018-12-19 00:38:21 Thank you, @realDonaldTrump administration for banning bump stocks.
5009 2018-12-19 00:38:14 Thank god the bump stocks are banned. Thank you POTUS.
5010 2018-12-19 00:38:08 >them guns
Bump stocks are illegal in the US now, I thought Canada had stricter gun controls
5011 2018-12-19 00:37:50 In light of this asinine ban on bump stocks, you better get this wall built, otherwise your base will be gone.
5012 2018-12-19 00:37:44 We will know it’s seriously being considered when Pharma stocks get hit.
The disconnect between advocating for Healthcare fixes and positive Stock Market performance is Nation level cognitive dissonance.
5013 2018-12-19 00:37:32 Adding to this i once looked at Shiller PE minus PE to get an idea of when they deviate and when Shiller PE tells you something PE doesn’t and the last time the deviation was this large was the late 80s which wasn’t a bad time to buy stocks.
5014 2018-12-19 00:37:04 Bump stocks aren't covered by 2A.
5015 2018-12-19 00:36:58 We are being DISTRACTED by “over the top” coverage. Should be talking about 10 billion to southern Mexico & (another country,) banning “ bump stocks” & no “mentally ill” person, no gun. Who decides? Define “ mentally ill?” 
5016 2018-12-19 00:36:43 Why did our leadership not stop the gun proliferation..how many tens of millions of AR-15s and bump stocks are already out in our comnunities
5017 2018-12-19 00:36:42 @Anonraine I spent many years trading OTC stocks. The pattern of price and releases are a classic P&D play. Especially putting out LOI’s.
5018 2018-12-19 00:36:33 Trump stated the wall has already been partially built. At least you know he's lying. Donate to the wall through the Trump Foundation. Lmfao! You should be more upset that Trump just banned bump stocks setting the stage for assault rifles next.
5019 2018-12-19 00:36:29 @ericnuttall The problem with Cdn oil equities is that both oil prices AND stock markets need to be positive in order for them to move up.

If either are down, Cdn oil stocks invariably trade down.
5020 2018-12-19 00:36:11 Have hit their high point cash OUT sell them for all their worth, NEVER forget to cash out, it fuckin sucks, I had a friend who bout 10,000 0.01$ stocks and they hit 1.00$ and he forgot to cash out and sell them all biggest feelsbadman ever so yeah stock market lol (2/2)
5021 2018-12-19 00:35:56 @davidhogg111 I believe your courage and motivation helped to give our country this small victory today . In 90 days bump stocks will be banned. It’s one of the first cracks in crumbling the NRA and it’s permeation of trump supporters
5022 2018-12-19 00:35:30 The City of London desperately needs unhindered access to the EU - trillions of dollars in insurance, pensions, stocks & derivatives etc - but some disaster Capitalists can get rich by betting that things will collapse - & her husband's one of them
5023 2018-12-19 00:35:30 The markets are correcting, making it time to consider defensive stocks.

5027 2018-12-19 00:35:09 I’m sure they will be lining up to surrender their stocks.
5028 2018-12-19 00:35:03 Bump stocks are not guns they are devices you add on to a firearm Banning them is not a problem The ban will be upheld
5029 2018-12-19 00:34:51 That’s about the return people are seeing on their stocks right now.
5030 2018-12-19 00:33:46 That is one reason bump stocks need to be banned
5031 2018-12-19 00:33:46 I see a great future for Sarah, working in a boiler room hawking penny stocks.
5032 2018-12-19 00:33:36 Bump stocks are not guns Banning them is not a problem

5034 2018-12-19 00:33:06 THEY FINALLY BANNED BUMP STOCKS!!!!!! ITS SMALL BUT ITS ONE STEP CLOSER
5035 2018-12-19 00:32:43 @greggutfeld You are usually on point on #2A issues but bump stocks being banned will do absolutely nothing. These were only used once-Vegas
5036 2018-12-19 00:32:35 The price of oil fell by more than 7% overnight. Energy stocks are sliding by 2.8% this morning (worst performers). Qantas $QAN +4.5% & Virgin $VAH +2.8% #ausbiz
5037 2018-12-19 00:32:17 Actually, it's the name of my dead cat. Iam Rachel. There's just too many of us, so, got stuck with a dead guys name!  Nah, no stocks. WTH should I?! Dumps just gonna land is in another recession, anyways!
5038 2018-12-19 00:32:00 No, it doesn't, but you can't ban accessories by Executive Order if there isn't an underlying law already passed by Congress that allows for such an order.  Banning bump stocks was explored years ago and it was determined that there was no legal means to do it.
5039 2018-12-19 00:31:58 And stocks went to hell anyway, so *poof!* ~ and all we have to show for it is this ‘yuge’ deficit.
5040 2018-12-19 00:31:49 What!?????
They just WANT us to pull out those bump stocks!!!
5041 2018-12-19 00:31:46 Even if they did roll over, stocks could be pricing that in now through early next yr and poised for a rally for most of 2019 a la 2009
5042 2018-12-19 00:31:43 Ok so investing in stock from a young age is important you can have a hundred bigger stocks or a thousand small ones, the stock market is a gamble but if you make lucky and obviously good choices aka stocks you know will do well and when you know those stocks... (1/2)
5043 2018-12-19 00:31:33 The Stock Market that own is on Bakersfield, Ca and I made custom rifle and shotgun stocks.  I am not sure how cats have wound up on my site.
5044 2018-12-19 00:31:27 Legit gun people don’t own bump stocks, because they are stupid. Not a hill to die on
5045 2018-12-19 00:31:24 Bump stocks?
5046 2018-12-19 00:31:14 Might as well put tits on a Boar Hog. Equally as useless as bump stocks.
5047 2018-12-19 00:30:50 But where does it end? Red dots? High Cap mags? I myself don't care about bump stocks for the same reasons as you, but you give the other side an nibble, they go for the whole enchilada.
5048 2018-12-19 00:30:42 @realDonaldTrump president Trump I hope it's not true you want to banned bump stocks do you understand how dangerous this is because they will keep doing this it's a sick mind control game to get are guns you can use a belt to do what a bump stop does.
5049 2018-12-19 00:30:32 It has taken me since October 8th to realize that my smokin trading results depended on the momo stocks and the uptrend. Now it seems, an up Friday leads to a down Monday and an up Tuesday that won't hold up Wednesday.

My new trading hold time is 6.5 hours.
Film at 11.
5050 2018-12-19 00:30:31 It's funny because the only reason they're banned is because the company who makes them doesn't pay 'protection' money to the NRA. If Remington or Smith & Wessen made bump stocks, those bad boys would be in Christmas stockings all over the country next week.
5051 2018-12-19 00:30:21 And bump stocks are the problem. 
5052 2018-12-19 00:29:49 Yes! Legislate this. #NoBumpstocks .@NRA The country has spoken! America doesn't want or need bump stocks.
5053 2018-12-19 00:29:37 The zeitgeist right now is *so* bearish. Not just crypto, credit, stocks, the whole complex, bank lending, we're finally apprehensive again that the cycle might end. 

It all comes down to the FOMC decision tomorrow. 

In the future, the FOMC will become less influential.
5054 2018-12-19 00:29:34 Speaking of the stock market....had a wild ass conspiracy thought. Did you know 10% of all people who own stocks account for 74% of the entire wealth of the stock market? So you know the ruling class is gong to be even more incensed at Trump now. Expect a blitz to get him in 2019
5055 2018-12-19 00:28:28 Today Trump hung Flynn out to dry and gave 5 billion to Mexico as he caved on the wall. Today, instead of giving the people truth about Vegas, he banned bump stocks.   Reality is, Trump is failing.  He lacks the will, the skill, or is simply compromised.  Sorry.
5056 2018-12-19 00:28:25 Discretion trade is to close all short positions and go flat before the #FOMC announcement.  Expecting some major whipsaws up and down at 2pm, and prudence calls for locking in profits beforehand. #Trading #stocks #Futures $TLT $ZN $TNX $ZB $TYX $NQ $NQ_F $ES $ES_F
5057 2018-12-19 00:28:07 I know.  I just was liquidating all stocks since I needed some capital to pay some things but then decided to keep my tech stocks since they were earning me a lot of money. A couple of them got over 60% return.   I got greedy instead of cashing out.
5058 2018-12-19 00:28:04 I only banned bump stocks because Vladimir Putin and the NRA gave me permission, and the bump stock manufacturers refused to pay me my usual bribe! Also did it to expand my executive power so I can redefine ANYTHING as illegal, muhaha!

5059 2018-12-19 00:28:01 $BE was doomed as soon as it did its split.... no reason other than an accounting trick. If you want risky weed stocks $EMC $GTEC $HIP $ALEF more bang for your buck
5060 2018-12-19 00:27:52 dondald tumpt fuckihg banned bump stocks guys you said this wouldny happen you said trust the plan 
5061 2018-12-19 00:27:49 Bump stocks should've never been made they're useless.
5062 2018-12-19 00:27:41 Coming from someone that owns and likes guns let me be the first one to say the NRA is a terrible organization that does not support your constitutional rights and did nothing to prevent presidential litigation pertaining to bump stocks.
5063 2018-12-19 00:27:27 @realDonaldTrump Ban bump stocks and put companies out of business in one fell swoop, all over a lie that bump stocks kill people. A LIE.
5064 2018-12-19 00:27:15 Not too sure about that. Part of it to me is the trade imbalance that Trump's created in various sectors. That certainly causes some people to try and sell their stocks before the markets nosedive badly into a recession.
5065 2018-12-19 00:27:08 Then they came for the 3D-printed guns, and I did not speak out—because they said only right-wing nutjobs would 3D-print a gun.

Then they came for the bump stocks, and I did not speak out—because they said only rednecks used bump stocks...
5066 2018-12-19 00:26:50 4 other comp to do likewise, it's 3D chess. we agree on the employees losing their stocks and other incentives. It's despicable, they need to unionize. I brought it up 2 illustrate that their are people actually doing something at a time when rep have the house, sen n presidency.

5069 2018-12-19 00:25:59 @ChrisMurphyCT     Hey Murphy,  What stopped you the last 20 years???   And why did Obama administration allow bump stocks to be sold???                                  DEMOCRATS LOVE GUNS!!!!
5070 2018-12-19 00:25:49 @GregGutfeldShow bump stocks can and will be homemade same with extended mags don’t you just love it when guntrol fiends don’t know their ass from an AR 15 which by the way AR doesn’t stand for assault rifle- my prob is that most people know this and act stupid anyway
5071 2018-12-19 00:25:42 "Margin Debt" is when corporations, hedge funds, and individuals are behind on their payments for stocks etc, which they can but for just 10% down. Defaults up to 10% worse since April. Not good.
5072 2018-12-19 00:24:49 I’m so happy we’re not playing 2 stocks with a game that has Incineroar in it.

I don’t even hate Incineroar but that character would be WACK to fight in a 2 stock meta.
5073 2018-12-19 00:24:46 One issue was the language proposed for the first ban of bump stocks said, any device that changed the rate of fire of an AR-15 was to be banned.  Meaning after market triggers used for competition tand other parts which improved performance.
5074 2018-12-19 00:24:43 It was about Bump Stocks not guns though. You are drifting off topic.
5075 2018-12-19 00:24:31 Neither an individual president, nor an entire party, can control or manipulate financial markets. The great majority of stocks, bonds, derivatives, commodities, funds are controlled by fund managers & the richest 1/10 of 1%. Lots by the 1%, some richest 10%; sm % middle class
5076 2018-12-19 00:24:22 The level of control the Chinese government looks to exert over both the economy and everyday life makes it impossible for a free market solution. Buying stocks in Chinese companies is inherently being long the Chinese government.
5077 2018-12-19 00:24:03 “Obama’ll take away yer guns!” No gun regulations

“Hillary’ll take away yer guns!” Never put in a position of power.

Individual-1: bans bump stocks and requires destruction or forfeiture.
5078 2018-12-19 00:24:02 Banning the manufacture, sale, transfer and ownership of bump stocks will EXACTLY stop everyone from getting them. Law abiding gun owners will follow the law and turn them over, and there won’t be any in stores for sale for the criminals. It will do exactly what it’s supposed to.
5079 2018-12-19 00:23:58 I will ease regulations on any and all weapon manufacturers who send me cash or donate to my legal defense fund. But bump stocks manufacturers refused to send me a bribe, so I usurped Congress' power to make laws and modified a law using executive power.
I'm all-powerful!
5080 2018-12-19 00:23:58 Small-caps beaten up. Bargains appearing. Avg S&P 600 stock 34% off its 52-wk high. Avg stocks' distance by sector?

5081 2018-12-19 00:23:53 Trump’s wall is dead. Bump stocks are now illegal. Federal Red Flag law and comprehensive background checks are next. Half the cabinet is in jail. @GOP Senate pulled support for Saudi war . . . But yeah - @POTUS is winning. Sure.
5082 2018-12-19 00:23:04 While Trump simultaneously bans bump stocks
5083 2018-12-19 00:22:09 .Susan, I know a bump stock ban gives politicians all kinds of warm fuzzies but..you do understand people can make their own bump stocks?
5084 2018-12-19 00:22:03 A little concerned, @realDonaldTrump's administration has now officially BANNED bump-stocks. How is this #MAGA?? How is this #Freedom?? How is this a return to the #Constitution??
5085 2018-12-19 00:21:31 Great news! And bump stocks are supposedly to be illegal by March. We shall see.
5086 2018-12-19 00:21:17 Hence concentrated portfolio!For this exact reason, microcap investing is not a "coffee tin" style of investing,you cant buy and sit on it no matter what. you gotta keep watching your stocks very closely, so how diversified can you be? Not much. uncorrelated stocks? Maybe!
5087 2018-12-19 00:20:55 Glad 2 see bump stocks r illegal now. Even the gun community thought it was sus
5088 2018-12-19 00:20:18 and they got stocks of them from places like East Germany. The R-23 missile on paper is a counterpart to the Sparrow but in reality struggled to hit barely maneuvering target drones. The R-73 on the other hand, a Sidewinder counterpart, was superb.
5089 2018-12-19 00:20:07 Wow hadn't looked at some of these energy stocks in awhile but ....might be a good time to start accumulating for next year.
5090 2018-12-19 00:19:57 China has consistently devalued their currency as a tool to fight economic spats with the United States. This aggressive devaluation makes Chinese stocks much riskier to own as geopolitical risk runs rampant.
5091 2018-12-19 00:19:57 The NRA can’t call for bump stocks to be regulated like machine guns, then cry afoul when they are. This is on them, they own it. They’re responsible for threatening thousands of gun owners with unlawful possession of a machine gun.
5092 2018-12-19 00:19:52  gee bump stocks were made to control your aim when holding your pants belt loop with your thumb. 
This is as stupid as outlawing sporks because of soup. 

#stupidshit
5093 2018-12-19 00:19:38 In all of history, there has only been one crime committed using bump stocks. But hey, I'm always happy to expand my executive power by usurping Congress and declaring MYSELF to be the legislative branch! You're welcome.
5094 2018-12-19 00:19:28 It's a good thing I have a piece of string to bump fire with. FYI government, bump stocks aren't the only way to bump fire a gun.

5096 2018-12-19 00:19:21 No, it's not personal. This sort of thing happens all the time in stocks too.
5097 2018-12-19 00:18:05 @realDonaldTrump  Bans bum stocks, agrees to keep government open without budget for the wall and dissolves Trump Foundation. #progress
5098 2018-12-19 00:17:48 Wow, Trump and his admin. actually banned bump stocks.  Not impressed though I think realistically that automatic guns, hand guns and bump stocks should always be illegal everywhere. Shotguns too
5099 2018-12-19 00:17:48 Time to point #crypto selling bots to bank stocks - far more profitable.

Short the banks - long crypto - all banks going to zero - let the decentralisation begin.

5100 2018-12-19 00:17:42 I think the bump stocks to civilians is actually unnecessary.  But I do support gun rights.  Especially to protect my home and family if necessary. Hopefully I will never have a need to.
5101 2018-12-19 00:16:58 The economy can. The stock market probably not. The problem in the past stocks would go up bc economy was good. So instead of fixing economy our leaders focused on “fixing” the stocks by using lax monetary policy. This way ppl would believe the economy is good even tho it isn’t.
5102 2018-12-19 00:16:48 So, clearly since you didn’t have to register bump stocks when you bought them, how does one know who has them.                                         Asking for a friend
5103 2018-12-19 00:16:43 Martha Stewart served 5 months in prison followed by house arrest for lying about a tip she received to dump
42K in stocks. She was not a threat to any American. She did not compromise our nation’s democracy. She did not get millions from Turkey as a bribe. 

But she is female.
5104 2018-12-19 00:16:30 You're welcome. Any time I can bypass a law passed by Congress by using an illegal executive branch order, expanding the power of my imperial Presidency, I'm happy to do so! My BATFE ruling bans not only bump stocks but also shoelaces and belt loops. Now I can arrest Dems at will
5105 2018-12-19 00:16:22 This is another obama law squashed!! Obama made bump stocks available on two different times!! So will the left protest this??
5106 2018-12-19 00:16:14 Not so much. You’ve been had. Search bump fire without bump stock on YouTube. Bump stocks are gimmicks.
5107 2018-12-19 00:16:06 Thanks Guy you got guts unlike the stained guy with the starched shirt to your right. Mr. anything for a buck. Likes pot stocks but votes for guys that would throw you in prison for smoking a joint.
5108 2018-12-19 00:16:02 I've praised him when he's done good things.  I'll criticize him when he does stupid shit.  Banning bump stocks and bank-rolling Latin America while the border isn't secure is stupid shit.  The wall was his #1 issue.  And we're still stuck with the stupid ACA too.
5109 2018-12-19 00:15:54 You tell’em Matt! Bump stocks actually make your shots less accurate too.
5110 2018-12-19 00:15:20 Mahalo.  It just came to me as I was watching my paltry stocks tank again. 
5111 2018-12-19 00:15:18 Softbank IPO flops (down 7% at the open, looking like crude oil). If 2019 is a down year in stocks and 2020 a recession year - will the IPO window close at some point, and what does that do to Uber and Lyft IPOs? Rush hour coming up.
5112 2018-12-19 00:15:14 @realDonaldTrump you can NOT ban bump stocks. You are NOT the legislative branch of government.  In fact you can NOT create any laws! You can only enforce what the Congress passes. They did NOT pass any Bump Stock Ban. #TraitorTrump #BumpStocks #2A
5113 2018-12-19 00:15:14 Obama's ATF looked at bump stocks and determined that they have no authority to regulate or ban them without an act of Congress.
5114 2018-12-19 00:14:22 Search bump fire without bump stock on YouTube.  Bump stocks are gimmicks.
5115 2018-12-19 00:14:21 SOCIAL SOLIDARITY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
5116 2018-12-19 00:14:20 If a democrat had banned bump stocks, the NRA and its members would be rioting in the streets.
5117 2018-12-19 00:14:20 Trump is really going to take a dip in support in coming week but the bad part it will because of ban on bump stocks.  A small part of base is going to be going nuts about this.
5118 2018-12-19 00:13:53 The purpose of a stock is to return capital to shareholders, specifically by generating cash returns. These Chinese stocks are not generating cash in USD, they are generating RMB. You must look at this trade as a USD-RMB spread.
5119 2018-12-19 00:13:44 Irrelevant. No person needs bump stocks.
5120 2018-12-19 00:13:23 My boy C-3PO told me to stop buying SEACOR $CKH #Stocks
5121 2018-12-19 00:13:22 Knives can do just as much damage. Take the China train situation for example. Bump stocks have been outlawed. Laws are put in place so when broken the proper action can be taken accordingly. By removing them there would be no action. Just total anarchy.
5122 2018-12-19 00:12:54 Stocks plunged as Visa Inc. unveiled a soulless sandal today.
5123 2018-12-19 00:12:43 LUKE I GOT JAILED INSIDE THAT BUS TWO STOCKS IN A ROW DFKJGHFKDJGHFD
5124 2018-12-19 00:12:12 Of course he should report on Trump banning bump stocks.
5125 2018-12-19 00:12:10 “Nearly everyone interested in common stocks wants to be told by someone else what he (or she) thinks the market is going to do. The demand being there, it must be supplied.” - Ben Graham
5126 2018-12-19 00:11:48 If Obama had been allowed to ban bump stocks people in Vegas would be alive.
5127 2018-12-19 00:11:39 2/2 Bump stocks don’t change the function of a semi auto at all. It’s still one shot for one action of the trigger. You easily achieve the same effect with a thumb and the belt loop of your pants. It’s also worrying to make 1/2 million people felons without going through Congress
5128 2018-12-19 00:10:47 Quick hit takes from Nov NPD: PS4 led the month in Units, but did face some out of stocks, esp during BF. Switch did great, big growth in Units and Dollars, Xbox One sales levels were also strong, helped by promotional efforts. All 3 did very well.
5129 2018-12-19 00:10:34 bonds and yen spikes wow. $ZB_F those are usually baddies for stocks. $SPY v $VIX unrelenting negative influence.
5130 2018-12-19 00:10:06 You don't. However, the precedent of a federal agency reinterpreting the law from a mechanical "function" to "conscious pull" is dangerous. In addition, the DOJ stated they only looked at bump stocks, not firearms which can be bump fired with or without a bump stock.
5131 2018-12-19 00:09:38 I found your site - I like the layout - One big issue, the market cap you have shown for XRP is incorrect. Reference yahoo or Apple stocks for correct amount - TY
5132 2018-12-19 00:08:12 If they would have kept the language just to bump stocks it would have been signed by all.  Instead they added language that would have made millions of gun owners criminals.  Once again they pushed too much.  I hope trump bans them with a EO.
5133 2018-12-19 00:08:05 Even the usually very conservative & staid National Farmers Union are joining in the chorus of WTF!! Food standards collapsed, no vetinary drugs to combat diseases, 40% shortfall in food stocks. These are normally rock solid Tory voters now saying, we didn't vote for this & stop!
5134 2018-12-19 00:07:42 Democrats on gun control in the White House 0. Trumpbans bump stocks. 2A traitor. Stick to what you promised. They are not a machine gun!!
5135 2018-12-19 00:07:06 How many Lockheed stocks did Trumps flunkies buy - yesterday ?
5136 2018-12-19 00:07:00 If Obama had banned bump stocks the out-of-shape militias would be taking over bird sanctuaries by now. The news cycle would would wall-to-wall. Gun sales would be through the roof, to the point there wouldn't be a gun left in a store. Where's the outrage? #BumpStocks #gunsense
5137 2018-12-19 00:06:47 "Disinflation matters more than stocks"... Certain charts I've seen of the correlation between US stocks and economic performance make me wonder...

But you're right. They will stay the course, or Powell will tamp down the hike to fewer bp, but it will still be a hike.
5138 2018-12-19 00:06:43 And how many stocks have you?
5139 2018-12-19 00:06:41 Trump probably banned bump stocks only because he was worried about his own safety, not urs. But good move, none the less.
5140 2018-12-19 00:06:28 Points of Chinese companies being undervalued due to inherent racism are incorrect.  Chinese companies are valued like American stocks.. based on their fundamental data.
5141 2018-12-19 00:06:02 The Trump administration has banned bump stocks. 
Good.
5142 2018-12-19 00:06:01 OK, I’m waiting for the NRA reaction to Trumps ban on bump stocks. Personally I think they never should’ve been approved by the ATF, but c’mon all you Trumpnistas, you blindly backed the guy and if an executive order can unilaterally ban bump stocks the POTUS can bans semi-autos.
5143 2018-12-19 00:05:56 Trump has you fooled. You don’t need a bump stock to bump fire.  Bump stocks have always been gimmicks and serious AR owners wouldn’t use one. It degrades accuracy.
5144 2018-12-19 00:05:41 #Republicans act surprised when they elect a lifelong #Democrat and he bans bump stocks.... just a #Democrat doing democrat things.... @realDonaldTrump

5147 2018-12-19 00:05:05 The losing 2 stocks when you SD , not inkling killing themselves
5148 2018-12-19 00:05:01 no doubt & he did issue a statement after Vegas about moving towards the ban of bumb stocks but obvs it was ATF work that made it happen sooner than later.
5149 2018-12-19 00:05:00 Doesn't matter 

Stocks run off rumors as much as teenage girls do.
5150 2018-12-19 00:04:44 Absolutely thrilled that bump stocks have now been made illegal.  Now it's time to ban semi-automatic & automatic assault weapons from public use.  No one needs one of those killing machines except to kill!!!  For hunting!!!???  Hunting my ass!!  Grow up!
5151 2018-12-19 00:04:44 So the Federal Government is going to ban the possession and or purchase of bump stocks as Maryland has already done. I’m  trying hard to see what the point of that is considering that the vast bulk of gun related deaths are caused by handguns.
5152 2018-12-19 00:04:43 I love the fact that trump took action on bump stocks. Good trump.
5153 2018-12-19 00:04:20 Just ignore it. Don't even say a word about him. They know he's in deep shit. The real narcissistic ones will want to double down. Let them. Think of today. Think of this week. Know he's spiraling out of control. Maybe talk about stocks dropping more than during the depression.
5154 2018-12-19 00:03:53 Personally I don't think bump stocks or firearms or other firearm enhancements should be banned at all, rather would be better for Police and civilians to be able ID potential bad people and have them checked out to make sure mentally squared away. People kill people.
5155 2018-12-19 00:03:51 I want to thank you @realDonaldTrump for banning bump-stocks. Seriously, thank you. I'm bluer than blue, but it's important to praise people when they do good things. You did a good thing. A great thing. I appreciate this. Thank you. Thank you.
5156 2018-12-19 00:03:29 @Iraqveteran8888 I hope you make a gun gripe video of what just happened today, when @realDonaldTrump passed the dumb bill banning bump stocks.
5157 2018-12-19 00:03:18 @realDonaldTrump You have so screwed up the market. Betting you are shorting stocks and tipping off Putin before you tweet something stupid.
5158 2018-12-19 00:03:13 J'invite cordialement les grossistes en #GiletsRouges à augmenter leurs stocks, ainsi que les maires à aménager leurs ronds points pour une occupation humaine fréquente... ;-) #jdcjdr
5159 2018-12-19 00:02:53 Bump stocks? I have fired submachine guns, fully-auto assault rifles, as well as medium and heavy machineguns. Why would I want a junk gizmo that SIMULATES fully-auto fire and pulls me off target? What I want is for the restrictions on the #2A to be repealed! Balance of power!
5160 2018-12-19 00:02:37 I highly recommend searching "bump stocks" on Twitter and having a scroll. The teabagger meltdown today is glorious.
5161 2018-12-19 00:02:11 1/4 I have a gut feeling we see a sell off in January in stocks...and money will flow into crypto
5162 2018-12-19 00:01:55 You just made criminals out of a couple of hundred thousand supporters by Banning bump stocks

5164 2018-12-19 00:01:50 Bump stocks banned, Trump Foundation forced to dissolve, Flynn ready to snitch some more. Bad day if you’re the type of person that still goes to lynyrd skynyrd concerts.
5165 2018-12-19 00:01:30 Semiautomatic rifles have the ability to for fire over 90 rounds a minute accurately without modification.  The ban on bump stocks is irrelevant without some controls on the weapons themselves.

5167 2018-12-19 00:01:22 I really need to start back trading stocks. Holla at me if you trade stocks. Specifically Option Traders.
5168 2018-12-19 00:01:11 First they came for our bump stocks and then they oh no that was it actually.
5169 2018-12-19 00:01:04 Does anyone have any stats on the 5M legal owners of bump stocks? Have any of them been responsible for any illegal activity? Ever? 
IMHO, this day is a marker...and it is not good for our country.
5170 2018-12-19 00:00:48 Bump stocks are dumb anyway cause you’re not gonna accurately hit the target with it moving around like that
5171 2018-12-19 00:00:46 So trump really banned bump stocks...& them nra folks was worried about Obama lol...ain’t no way the atf about to track down bump stocks 
5172 2018-12-19 00:00:36 Bump stocks are banned and anybody who owns them will be a felon.  In NJ they banned magazines over 10rd making owners a felon.
