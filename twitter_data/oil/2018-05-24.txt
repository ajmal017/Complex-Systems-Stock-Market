13 2018-05-24 23:58:27 Idiot. Your ignorance is palpable!Under UPA, oil subsidy bill was 2.5 lakh crore! Higher subsidy=Higher fiscal deficit=Higher inflation=Lower purchasing power! Under @narendramodi, oil subsidy is less than 50,000 cr! Inflation was 12% in 2013 & 4.58% now! via @Sanju_Verma_

40 2018-05-24 23:57:31 So Chris what is the excuse now?

Trump bragged the U.S is exporting more oil than anyone else? One would think if we are so oil rich our gas prices would be dropping.

Food prices, interest rates also going up!

50 2018-05-24 23:55:39 walang oil ang Japan, pero konti lang ang Tamad at reklamador sa kanila... yun ang pinagkaiba... sa atin kasi may isang myembro lang ng pamilya na nakapag abroad, eh yung mga naiiwan kung umasta parang mayaman na, at di nag naghahanap ng sariling kita. walang plan B
51 2018-05-24 23:55:38 I don’t care what anyone says, CBD oil is fucking magical
52 2018-05-24 23:55:37 We could learn a lot from an oil rich, low population country on how to fund education? 

They are the country equivalent of the rich Britons you apparently resent. 

Their oil fund equates to roughly $200,000 per citizen... 

Our fiscal situations are non-comparable.
53 2018-05-24 23:55:24 I thought @realDonaldTrump was bragging about our oil independence so why are gas prices .54 cents higher than a year ago? Screwball Trump at it again!

How long can regrets last
This middle aged anxiety
My inner voice is killing me
Not this time silly head

I swam out emotional prism
Just to escape your prison
It's your home now, don't you like
This oil my match will strike

56 2018-05-24 23:55:08 Those countries are incomparable to the UK. Having huge oil reserves & a only few million people helps.
57 2018-05-24 23:54:27 @JohnWal55664539 Great shot! Have you taken care of the oil change?
58 2018-05-24 23:54:19 I'm sure because he owns lots of gas and oil stocks, and we are being made to pay for his expensive upkeep!

60 2018-05-24 23:54:17 No sh*t, they want to steal the oil and can’t do it on their own.

70 2018-05-24 23:52:58 Of course it's about oil; we can't really deny that," said Gen. John Abizaid, former head of U.S. Central Command and Military Operations in Iraq, in 2007. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan agreed, writing in his memoir, "I am saddened that it is politically
71 2018-05-24 23:52:53 I use to the exact same one until I forgot to get the oil changed and ruined the engine

104 2018-05-24 23:48:55 European and US shares fell in overnight trading as crude oil prices dropped. The “after the fact” explanations point to reports OPEC will ease restrictions in response to falling production in Venezuela and Iran @MicMcCarthy_CMC
105 2018-05-24 23:48:47 I would actually like to see a breakdown on how oil prices are determined! Let's have an independent agency go over the books of all the gas companies!

132 2018-05-24 23:46:28 You're whistling past the grave yard - investment in O/G is moving to jurisdictions that have legal and market certainty, and lower regs - and Oil Sands development is not what is was in the past in terms of footprint and cost.

134 2018-05-24 23:46:23 If course the recent decline was for decision. Including buying external oil to gift Cuba. Now they will destroy the oil field's structure (producing more than ideal) so that, even If they fix Venezuela política, oil output Will not easily recover.

137 2018-05-24 23:45:42 If you think the administration has not communicated with oil producers weeks ago,  then we are in trouble, not because of the lack of oil supply, but because of the policy failure.  But I think they did communicate  earlier than what people think. Only time will tell.

150 2018-05-24 23:44:17 Had to reschedule mine. Get some peppermint oil!
151 2018-05-24 23:44:11 If you get #chiggers (#jiggers), you have to cut off their air supply to get rid of them. Cover the area in oil or cover the welts in nail polish. Easy and effective solution.
152 2018-05-24 23:44:03 The #TMX is about selling oil to Asia. About transforming Metro Vancouver into a major oil shipping port. The YVR pipeline replacement is about replacing something due for replacing and doing that, with trying to keep more tankers off the roads. Huge Difference!!!!
153 2018-05-24 23:43:52 You need to try harder man. First set up a whatsapp chain about how oil prices were actually lower in UPA time than NDA. I am sure your blind bhakts will always support proliferation of lies and stupidity!! #FuelLootBySuitBoot #FuelChallenge
154 2018-05-24 23:43:47 @FarOutAkhtar 1)We dont produce Oil. We import, 2)International Prices nt in our control. 3)Fuel should hv been under GST 4)States dont agree for same as apart frm Liquor biggest source of revenue 5)Govt needs revenue for spending 6)Needs Constitution amendment whn states agree
155 2018-05-24 23:43:37 Just keep it tidy really and oil helps.
156 2018-05-24 23:43:36 Some of the information from the earlier article I linked to was dated and other also not backed up by facts. Also mentioned in MH article is Santos, the shale oil company involved in northwest NSW, also a client of SAS Group.
I won't claim its all factual, but it is interesting.
157 2018-05-24 23:43:27 the cost of producing gasoline and diesel – have risen due to a tighter global oil supply/demand balance and lower inventories compared to last year. It’s because of the demand of the oil.
158 2018-05-24 23:43:17 Well if you would do a quick Google search, then you would find that oil is not our only non renewable resource lmao if that was the case then we wouldn't have a dying planet. Saying I am a futurist is like saying in 24 hours it will be tomorrow
159 2018-05-24 23:42:48 We are live the next three nights from Lucas Oil Speedway for the Show-Me 100 on LucasOilRacingTV.  Be sure to visit their website and subscribe to the streaming broadcast.
160 2018-05-24 23:42:48 Definitely not nuclear with its inherent dangers, oil offers a safe alternative while contributing immensely to the national economy!
161 2018-05-24 23:42:35 Maybe just add some olive oil?
162 2018-05-24 23:42:25 I’m sitting at home waiting for my mom to come home so she can put warm oil in my ears to help with my cold ahdjsks
163 2018-05-24 23:42:22 Gotta season it with salt and Olive oil right?
164 2018-05-24 23:42:16 Oil change done too. I am really adulting today.
165 2018-05-24 23:42:05 Dad just got home.  He has purchased A Street Cat Named Bob from Chapters.  We do not buy books often.  This is a treasure however.  We also have The World According to Bob and Bob No Ordinary Cat.  He also bought flour, lots of tuna for the cats, oil and peanut butter. Thank you
166 2018-05-24 23:42:03 CBD oil even gets rid of period cramps too! Literal Godsend
167 2018-05-24 23:41:46 Cbd oil
168 2018-05-24 23:41:30 Sir say some thing about high petrol prices 70% population leving in a fear of inflation no jobs time to make the govt. Aware of what & how a  comman man suffering he forced to pay more here even oil under 80$ in the market post 2014 till date
169 2018-05-24 23:40:59 I was asked by guys today at the pool if I could come and put my tanning oil on their back..... and Kyle wonders why I want my own pool and don’t want to go to a public pool to lay out ??????
170 2018-05-24 23:40:46 Oil in coffee? Who in their right mind....
171 2018-05-24 23:40:44 Again...whether Squamish, Vancouver or Burnaby chooses to exercise their legal rights in court at a cost or not to taxpayers....that doesn't appear relevant to a Langley rate payer unless they're lobbying for big oil! The cost of which services to you are being driven up?
172 2018-05-24 23:40:43 Bahahaha,  you're as big of a snake oil salesmen as the twattler in chief
173 2018-05-24 23:40:28 My first, a 900, I used to do my own oil, brakes, a/c, plugs, etc... even fixed a warped head and changed the gasket. A bit harder with all the extra computers in the more recent models, but I loved getting my hands dirty working on all of them. #900 #9000 #93 #95

178 2018-05-24 23:39:57 What do non renewable resources have to do with it? We don’t need oil. Limited Astrid belt mining can bring all the rare earth elements we need back to earth. You literally are in love with the idea of a dying earth, and just make shit up as to why it is doomed.
179 2018-05-24 23:39:53 y’all use wild growth oil? does it work? #qtna
180 2018-05-24 23:39:39 How many of your promises have you kept?.  N1 = $1  No; Removal of oil subsidies , No, , creation of million of Jobs, No.
181 2018-05-24 23:39:28 The fact remains, Mr. Kenney, that AB has the lowest debt-to-GDP of all provinces. It also has the lowest provincial taxes. Even in good oil times, the ABPCs propped up spending using income from the Heritage Trust Fund, which Fund hasn't received funds since 1989. /2
182 2018-05-24 23:39:24 gold , silver , copper uranium jade. Oil natural gas lumber and the list goes on.
183 2018-05-24 23:39:24 Yea that's way to long at least for my hair lol...I have to deep condition and do hot oil treatments. If I waited that long my hair would be so dry 
184 2018-05-24 23:39:22 Is this the NDP oil wrestling dude?

186 2018-05-24 23:39:19 DONALD IS WINNING BIGLY! He's a snake oil merchant & doesn't have a clue about economics - or decency.
187 2018-05-24 23:39:15 Also as interns for Democrats on the hill.
188 2018-05-24 23:39:02 Afraid it is. The oil wars and Islamophobia are a direct result of car-dependency. We are getting what we deserve.

190 2018-05-24 23:38:46 Peppermint oil on spots is a blessing from heaven, why have I only just discovered this 
191 2018-05-24 23:38:29 Night 1 at Lucas Oil Speedway.  Hot laps are on the track
192 2018-05-24 23:38:17 Who has just spent his rubies, and left my shop with lamp oil & a smile? Nobody until you come on in my friend!
193 2018-05-24 23:38:15 You forgot "Houston is oil".
Also, not much to hate about Chicago these days 
194 2018-05-24 23:37:45 Kesimpulan daripda bulan pertama keje company oil and gas, secara fizikal dan mentalnya saya telah koyak gila babi anjing pada usia muda
195 2018-05-24 23:37:44 £200m of that City figure originates from the oil sheikh’s wallet (which in turn originates off the back of Bangladeshi slaves)
196 2018-05-24 23:37:28 Listen!! I know how to peep sneaky sht, you can't outslick the oil can feel me
197 2018-05-24 23:37:17 Trump promised Big Oil huge profits for campaign donations and he’ll do anything to fulfill a promise to wealthy donors and lobbyists. Even though middle class families are going broke buying gas again
198 2018-05-24 23:37:03 I’m pretty sure I may be, lately I’ve needed a little oil or grease in my knees and back to get going in the morning 
199 2018-05-24 23:36:57 We’ve eaten DF turkey and loved it. So tender. Would suggest popping the turkey into cold oil as opposed to hot then grad heat. Maybe pat the bird dry as much as poss. @timhayward prob knows a how to!
200 2018-05-24 23:36:57 I haven’t cooked with sunflower oil I’ll try that one day
201 2018-05-24 23:36:52 Black women, what hair products can we use?! Hell.

Please don’t tell me coconut oil. The most overhyped product to date.
202 2018-05-24 23:36:50 Independence would make that less likely. We'd spend a decade recovering our current economic position as we dealt with our deficit and funded a new currency. You're selling snake oil.
203 2018-05-24 23:36:28 They'll ask what it is when going through security, if you say it's a vape it's allowed but if they find out it's oil they'll get OPO on you
204 2018-05-24 23:36:24 Oh, definitely! They both have their uses. In sandwiches I prefer oil, in salads, water.
205 2018-05-24 23:36:17 Peppermint oil on the back of the neck while your feet are in a cold bowl of water
206 2018-05-24 23:36:12 Do you mean whether? Or is someone raining on your parade? Do you actually speak English when you are abroad? I expect Europe will benefit from trump's withdrawal from the Iran deal. Oil is up to 80 dollars a barrel.
207 2018-05-24 23:36:10 It's been too long between oil changes! Spring cleaning long overdue! Will we need more prisons?
208 2018-05-24 23:36:10 Told my dad I needed an oil change and asked if I should text my uncle. He replies, “Why didn’t you text him sooner? He could’ve done it Saturday if you told him earlier.”

I found out I needed an oil change TODAY.
209 2018-05-24 23:36:09 I said that peppermint oil repels spider...Anna found the correct essential oil and mixed it up and put it in a bottle and now the entire house is so pepperminty that my throat and eyes burn....she's so my kid....
210 2018-05-24 23:35:55 Politicians are earning in crores coming from the rate defined by the politicians for oil
211 2018-05-24 23:35:51 I put wayyy too much peppermint oil in my bath and now i can’t tell if Its hot or cold
212 2018-05-24 23:35:40 I had this friend right, she loved this Frida Kahlo painting about a girl in a death mask so I painted her, Oil on canvas.. but with the death mask on..I think about this a lot..
213 2018-05-24 23:35:39 So the narrative has changed so quickly. You already have an excuse prepared for us as well when we win the UCL.
'Oil money'

Get a life salty
214 2018-05-24 23:35:32 And if government owns a pharmaceutical we can get tax cuts as they will be getting their revenue there. 38% tax is no child’s play on top of high school fees, oil increases, food increases, etc
215 2018-05-24 23:35:28 Ur good... self oil
216 2018-05-24 23:35:14 Too bad they aren't  considering what increased oil tanker traffic will do to them.  #hypocracy
217 2018-05-24 23:35:10 Denver company to sell Texas oil and gas assets for $570 million
218 2018-05-24 23:35:05 So where’s the green blob when it comes to foreign oil?
219 2018-05-24 23:35:04 If you are lazy like me, and don’t want to go through all of this, do what I did. Go to your dermatologist, and asked to be prescribed Accutane. This medication is a lifesaver. It shrinks your oil glands throughout your entire body. (Cnt)
220 2018-05-24 23:35:01 Lucas Oil Speedway is unbelievable. Watching live from Boston MA and can’t get over it. @lucasspeedway
221 2018-05-24 23:34:54 If concealed carriers drew their weapons every time they felt the slightest upset, it's reasonable to assume there would be many arrests.  Sure, you have the occasional idiot as you would in any large population.  I'll wait for your data of mass arrests.
222 2018-05-24 23:34:47 There is a weird smell under the kitchen sink.  I took out the garbage, recycling, and compost last night.  I put baking soda in the compost bin, grapefruit essential oil in the new garbage bag, and left the doors open overnight.  Smell has faded but is still there. 
223 2018-05-24 23:34:32 Apparently ‘tuna in water’ and ‘tuna in oil’ taste completely different 
224 2018-05-24 23:34:18 Think of all those countries we've penetrated without their consent... It's okay though... They just didn't know how badly they wanted our D...mocracy.

Kinda on them though... Flaunting that oil like they didn't want to give it to us...
225 2018-05-24 23:34:13 Coconut oil is the paste of the soul, good for everything
226 2018-05-24 23:34:13 Cucumber, coconut oil, and green tea will literally fix your life.
That is all.

230 2018-05-24 23:32:28 I see English wasn’t your best subject. In other words it sucks. And if you are American, now I know why you like the imbecile in chief. Now go change the oil in your scooter.
231 2018-05-24 23:32:26 Bruh you know the year has hit $4/gal in Florida was the year oil companies made BILLIONS to pocket. That shit made me mad af.
232 2018-05-24 23:32:00 Lol 
233 2018-05-24 23:31:52 I’m depressed but I have like 8 essential oil diffusers going I’m just gonna take a nap in my muggy pine scented heaven
234 2018-05-24 23:31:11 It's an analogy but I think it's appropriate given economic realities I mentioned in previous tweet.Oil will certainly play a role for some time, but the role will be declining. Global climate targets also require a big chunk of remaining fossil fuels to stay in ground.

All of his moves are about his & his rich supporter's wallets

245 2018-05-24 23:29:57 My memory is actually pretty good.

I remember the lasting damage inflicted on our country by the Tories in the 1980s when oil revenues were used to finance tax cuts rather than investment in infrastructure and public services. 

Test me on another.
246 2018-05-24 23:29:54 Time for the peace-loving people of the USA to stand up and protest this misadministration's sellout of our commitments to Iran denuclearization, just to raise oil prices for "select countries" (Saudis, Russia & US) via Iran blockage & market chaos.
247 2018-05-24 23:29:52 One error.  CBD oil contains NO THC.
248 2018-05-24 23:29:50 It makes a pretty bold claim that eating the paleo or keto way can cure you of diseases. They argue that one should only eat organic, despite scientific evidence showing that organic food is not more nutritious. Coconut oil isn't as healthy as people claim.

252 2018-05-24 23:29:14 WOOF The catnip plant contains an oil called hepetalactone which does for cats what marijuana does to some people
253 2018-05-24 23:29:10 I've tried just about everything. Medical marijuana helps (I use it as an oil under my tongue, so it doesn't make me high) but it isn't perfect. I still have trouble falling and staying asleep

Rumors have said gulutzan yawney and viveiros will be asst coaches for oil, and that's hockey just announced it as official, but I'm not seeing any releases on it. Is it official?
255 2018-05-24 23:29:03 Well realistically the president doesn’t have control over cost

It’s all oil companies. When Obama was president gas prices hit $4/ gallon in the south but it wasn’t his fault. It’s the greedy oil companies fault.
256 2018-05-24 23:28:49 Got both my oil defusers going for this sick house. Please don’t let Owen get sick This is when I use my breast milk that I’ve been savoring in my freezer since my supply is so lowBreast milk is the best medicine for babies.

265 2018-05-24 23:27:50 Dislike that I have to wake up so early just to get an oil change & when I get there I have to wait 
266 2018-05-24 23:27:44 Just think how big of a viewership #FoxNews could have if they do this all the time, fair & balanced. I'm still a never #Trump gal because I know what kind of an animal he is. He's a snake oil salesmen at best. #FactsMatter #rosie

273 2018-05-24 23:26:59 I don’t wonder. In my case I didn’t have to look far for answers. I have incredibly stupid family members, who would buy the snake oil. They believe in fantasy & hear what they want to hear. We apparently have millions of these dotards yearning for a poppa dotard. They found him.
274 2018-05-24 23:26:54 So they market it as avocado oil mayo but READ THE LABEL. Still has inflammatory canola and soybean oil. Freaking deceptive food industry.
275 2018-05-24 23:26:39 Oil se 
276 2018-05-24 23:25:54 If we consumed less, what we currently produce should be enough.  We need to find a way to recycle existing products and stop poisoning the oceans with petroleum based products. Of course that would move profits from the oil companies to the recyclers.
277 2018-05-24 23:25:41 Elon is right. It was also Big Oil that created the critical, FALSE claims about marijuana yrs ago.

383 2018-05-24 23:12:11 N btw India's oil bill for just the last fiscal was $144.29 billion. So in the grand scheme of things, that $6 billion payment due to Iran(which was already set aside btw) was just a small drop in the bucket n not big enough a figure to justify last 4 yrs of excise burdens.

428 2018-05-24 23:05:41 You would think a grocery store named Sri Balaji would have south indian idhayam sesame oil.  But no.  WTF?
429 2018-05-24 23:05:35 Could it be Alberta will simply reduce delivery of current, discounted (landlocked) priced oil and redirect that volume through the KM expansion? In that way emissions remain within the cap, as Premier Notley claims.
430 2018-05-24 23:05:28 You can put olive oil on a qtip and rub it on the tick. The tick will eventually let go and you can get it with a napkin
431 2018-05-24 23:05:25 Such a sunny day. Gonna change the oil on macalah car and possibly wash it again. Someone should come over and smoke with me

433 2018-05-24 23:05:06 We get 6% of our oil from Iran. Trump's actions are definitely a big part of gas prices increasing.
434 2018-05-24 23:05:06 I love getting my oil changes at the dealership. I always enjoy my free car wash 
435 2018-05-24 23:04:59 It’s so sad that I’ve been waiting to dye my hair for sooo long and this is the end result lmaoo el moshkeleh olaplex treatments are gonna be really expensive so I’m working with coconut oil and deep conditioners for now hopefully that helps 
436 2018-05-24 23:04:34 Radical empathy will solve our problems?

How ‘bout you and all your political friends quit taking gobs of money from special interests; big pharmaceutical, Saudi Arabia, the oil industry, etc?

The Russians are there to protect that pipeline and to stop Syria ending up like Libya. They have been invited. We haven't. Iran is next. It's big business. It always is.

455 2018-05-24 23:02:59 Since gas has climbed 57 cents per gallon in the past three weeks, we must ask, how much did that put in the GOPs pockets? Did they know, does tRump own oil stocks? #WakeUpAmerica

462 2018-05-24 23:02:24 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
463 2018-05-24 23:02:11 My first game with it was 180, which is good for me! I’m still learning/adjusting. Crazy how the amount of oil can make such a difference.

480 2018-05-24 23:00:13 India had since July 2011 paid euros to clear 55 percent of its purchases of Iranian oil. The remaining 45 percent due amount was remitted in rupees in accounts Iranian oil company opened in Kolkata-based Uco Bank. It was already there to be released. Stop spreading fake news.
481 2018-05-24 23:00:09 Decarbonization, that is funny: The percentage of fossil fuels in the world’s energy mix — coal, oil and natural gas — is still lingering well above 80 percent, a figure that has changed little in 30 years. HT Daily Pfenning

483 2018-05-24 22:59:24 Basically they are being attacked by us for attempting sovereignty from the global hegemony - nationalizing oil & shifting out of the petrodollar.

485 2018-05-24 22:59:13 The choice of Iraq wasn't arbitrary. Every ME state that has decided to move off the dollar to buy oil has been hit. Don't take my word for it, do your research. In Libya, Gaddafi had planned to move to a pan African currency backed with its own gold reserves. Syria is trying
486 2018-05-24 22:59:09 The catch call of this Coalition is to get rid of oil,gas and dairy for IT jobs
Wrong the IT industry will create less jobs as they advance their human knowledge into AI and SuperComputing
We need hands on jobs that will absorb highly skilled and unskilled work
487 2018-05-24 22:59:08 Wish someone would take my car & get 2 tires put on it & get my oil changed for me tomorrow while I’m at work 
488 2018-05-24 22:58:58 Well, let’s put it this way.  If the Oilers start slow again and scapegoat McLellan (instead of pointing the finger at where the blame for the subpar roster SHOULD BE), the Oil won’t have to look very far for qualified coaching candidates.

495 2018-05-24 22:57:54 Our PM should at this point by now, disallowed Notley’s Alberta team from passing a law restricting gas & oil to BC. And also set BC straight by disallowing the legal court challenge in return. This is now out of control and ridiculous. Our PM is failing us all.

503 2018-05-24 22:57:17 PS - FUCK OIL AND GAS. You’re an an inevitably time/supply limited industry. And you care more about lining your pockets than the health, well-being or LIVES (ahem - Anadarko) of Americans. Not to mention the well being of our freaking PLANET
504 2018-05-24 22:57:13 Lmao honestly! Especially if you’re throwing the gold one and castor oil one away.
505 2018-05-24 22:57:09 We are not so small and inconsequential we could easily take over their spot in world production. In 2009 they tried to drive  oil into the ground and in 2015 they did the same. They were the biggest sponsors of the juggling idiot, all he has to do is destroy the patch

508 2018-05-24 22:56:39 thankfully I don't have that problem, if only because the one time I took fish oil it made me hallucinate wildly for about 12 hours

510 2018-05-24 22:56:29 Trump jettisoned the Iran nuclear deal and hired people who have openly supported an invasion as national security advisers. Should this not affect the price of oil?

521 2018-05-24 22:54:21 Start by stop buying oil and gas. Every 2 or more vehicle household by now should own at least one EV or Hybrid. We have to stop wasting our black gold oil out our exhaust pipes standing in line for a $2 Timmy’s Coffee.

535 2018-05-24 22:53:02 What? You thought I wasn't paying attention, didn't you?

Twitter's algorithms tattle-tale based off of prior tweets and retweets. Big oil is effed up in twitter. No one will be able to forget because of that dynamic. 

About the only positive for computerized algorithms, so far.
536 2018-05-24 22:52:48 Fish oil helps with anxiety as well.  After ten whole years of dealing in anxiety every single day, I can see a HUGE difference . 
537 2018-05-24 22:52:42 it's the globalists wanting the oil

543 2018-05-24 22:52:19 Well.  Or to secure oil rights.  Overthrow democracies.  Defend genocidal dictatorships.  Etc.

I get what you're saying, though.

563 2018-05-24 22:50:13 But that's his solution to AB turning off the tap. Like to see that argued in front of a supreme court justice in his reference question. 'You see judge. We can't allow AB to clog our ports with their tankers. If we need oil we'll use U.S.  tankers.' Hear the laughter?
564 2018-05-24 22:49:56 don forget to oil ur friends
565 2018-05-24 22:49:56 A table spoon of palm oil. Not fried. I think day and night: or whenever. I don’t know the timing.

567 2018-05-24 22:49:41 If they want to stay in office/get elected then any Premier of Alberta is going to push oil and look after their own prov first
568 2018-05-24 22:49:20 just used coconut oil to remove my stage make up and my eyes are fully blurred like am honestly blind
569 2018-05-24 22:49:17 Everyone is so boring out in Rhode Island like honestly if I didn’t get out of work rn and got my oil change done today I wouldn’t be out here.

574 2018-05-24 22:48:55 I'm just a guy standing in front of another guy he doesn't know on twitter wondering where Tedcatles Oil Products fit in to this.
575 2018-05-24 22:48:50 Loser pays should be the gold standard.
576 2018-05-24 22:48:48 Agree. One particular group w which I avoid all climate change discussion & just focus on 'every administration since Reagan has supported reducing reliance on foreign oil for national security reasons'. That usually brings any confrontational attitude to a screeching halt.
577 2018-05-24 22:48:44 I actually saw each of those articles before posting, and no, I don't work for "big oil". I'm a photographer. I'd probably be making much more money if I did, though, but I prefer working in a field I studied and am passionate about. However, Musk is beyond frivolous.
578 2018-05-24 22:48:35 These crooked OPEC COUNTRYS and our own CROOKED OIL COMPANIES
Need to be brought in line. There is no oil shortage. Why Congress can't put pressure on these crooks is a mystery.
I thought GOUGHING THE PUBLIC was illegal.
579 2018-05-24 22:48:32 Iran is nothing like Saudi, The two are incomparable.. Iran has an ancient rich distinctive Persian culture and 1 of the oldest countries in the world, Saudi was artificially created in 1932 from a nomadic wahabbi desert tribe backed by America for oil 
580 2018-05-24 22:48:17 The clothes they're wearing, the cardboard signs they're holding and the crayons they probably drew those signs with--all powered by OIL.

592 2018-05-24 22:46:59 @RahulGandhi I am glad that you are concerned about fuel price. 
I wish you were so concerned when UPA govt bought oil from Iran on credit which was not paid.
I challenge you to remove state taxes on fuel in @INCIndia Congress ruled states. 
Prove that you are not #PAPPU

612 2018-05-24 22:44:35 But the good news is that you're almost at the "do 100 jumping jacks, scream a profanity, and inhale a handful of peppermint essential oil" stage. Unless that's just me.
613 2018-05-24 22:44:25 because they were allowed to put aside some of their oil money .While in brit it was spent before it was out of the ground on structural ando ther items Ask Westminster they will tell you We were not allowed to do so!!
614 2018-05-24 22:44:17 Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump criminal gang are making money & using it to buy votes & gain more power. Big oil is their biggest supporter. Boycott gasoline!
615 2018-05-24 22:44:15 Perhaps you libs would prefer that it was oil?

617 2018-05-24 22:43:51 My wife uses a cannabis oil regimen to treat pain and stiffness. It's hard to dose and dispense so o used my 3d printer to create and manufacture the @DowlingDoser. It helps dose the very strong oils into capsules for swallowing orally. The relief last 6 to 8 hours.
618 2018-05-24 22:43:40 Every Albertan needs to recognize the reason for the current debt. The culprit is former PC governments! In late 1980’s, they discontinued setting aside funds for the INEVITABLE drop in oil demand & price and squandered any surpluses. Clearly irresponsible fiscal management.

622 2018-05-24 22:43:01 The problem with your support for ongoing dependence is that it relies on the goodwill of English MPs. Barnett won't be around forever. It was expedient for Westminster whilst huge transfers of oil revenue went the other way over last 30yrs but clock is now ticking.

626 2018-05-24 22:42:12 That one that’s like garlic oil rather than butter on dead thin dough is the one.
627 2018-05-24 22:42:11 I see Brent oil approaching $80 per barrel. Dunno when that last happened, but it's the reason behind the recent dramatic steady fuel price increase at the pumps. #peakoil is real. Even though it doesn't even seem to be a #hashtag anymore!!!
628 2018-05-24 22:42:11 That’s an opinion you’re quoting, not the truth. The OIL SANDS contribute to our economy more than any other natural resource and we all use fossil-fuel based products. Would you rather support the middle eastern countries with horrific enviro standards and pathetic human rights?
629 2018-05-24 22:42:08 Do they want a photoshoot? I can run to the store and get some baby oil.
630 2018-05-24 22:41:58 Not an enlightening conversation; for example, oil or sugar derived from #bioengineered varieties are exactly the same as "conventional". Interesting to review survey format for the same lack of nuance.

634 2018-05-24 22:41:13 If I recall, oil prices should be different but its set to the price it is because its to help 10% of the world's oil get its dues for reasons.  So the high prices helps that 10% that would struggle if prices were correct, as it would be oust from the market.
635 2018-05-24 22:41:02 Ismael taught me how to change my oil & now I'll finally know how to do that and change my tires while he's deployed. Lol I feel so accomplished & proud of myself

640 2018-05-24 22:40:34 Feeling so very old. Today, @jkenney said he'd never seen Albertans as angry about their place in Canada as they are now. I mean, I'm angry. But I remember the NEP. I remember Lougheed throttling oil production. I remember when we elected a separatist MLA. #ableg #cdnpoli

658 2018-05-24 22:39:01 Sorry but you don’t live in Alberta. When the prime minister fails to recognise you on our (150) birthday of Canada, wants to phase out of the oil sands. List goes on and on. Yes, we are finally fragile enough to leave. Alberta and Saskatchewan GONE in 2019 if Trudy returns.

670 2018-05-24 22:37:18 A few points about a Sovereign Fund

You don’t need oil revenues for a Sovereign Fund

Revenue from anywhere will do

If you run a surplus. No problem

If you run a deficit. Big problem

Why?

You’d need your fund to rise faster than the cost of your borrowing

Not easy

Nope.

821 2018-05-24 22:19:04 During Congress time Oil subsidy bill was 2.5 lakh crore. Higher subsidy = Higher fiscal deficit = Higher inflation = Lower purchasing power.

921 2018-05-24 22:07:28 ...The same with the oil industry and the auto industry. When half the cars in the world are electric, the world will still go around. People that invest in oil can invest in something that is more productive. If the auto industry slims down, people will do something else.

I always ate very low fat, no omega 6 oils, no processed food, mainly olive oil, but I burnt just looking at the sun. Now I don`t burn anymore on VLC.
Can it be it`s not the omega 6 oils but rather not enough of the good fats?

1021 2018-05-24 21:56:14 If we synthesize an analysis of geopolitics, resource distribution, and macroeconomics I think we’ll get close to the true drivers of world affairs. basically China is preparing to make its currency a full fledged alternative to $.

1022 2018-05-24 21:56:12 Only Norway has oil, the other Nordic countries, like Finland, don’t. We don’t need to worry about illegals from neighbouring countries, because we treat them like citizens when they enter the country. How does the US support illegals, exactly?

1052 2018-05-24 21:52:52 So I finally watched the @DoctorChrisVT #TheDoctorWhoGaveUpDrugs, strong on overuse of Calpol. Not so strong on understanding use of #ADHDmeds. You can't come to the conclusion as one pysch says that they're 'snake oil' based on 1 study. Other studies report benefits over 10yrs.

1117 2018-05-24 21:43:03 Of all the billionaires and billionaire car companies, not a single one wanted to touch the electric vehicle market.
Because they were happy to keep burning oil for your money.

They actively bought up patents & buried them, to prevent anyone else from doing it.

1123 2018-05-24 21:42:37 Such data is useful for a first taste of what’s happening inside, intelligence. Valuation is a big word to use on such exercise.
Furthermore, there is an implicit huge value not considered, such as oil politics management.
1124 2018-05-24 21:42:36 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

1145 2018-05-24 21:40:45 The question is, why hasn't anyone else filled those markets?

Because the giant oligarchs who run government AND own the oil companies didn't want to lose business.

Look at the story of the EV1. People held funerals for their cars when they were forcefully taken away & trashed.

1250 2018-05-24 21:29:08 This is what we do in the south!  Get the store brand canned biscuits (i.e. cheap), open them, fry them on medium heat in vegetable oil until golden brown outside & cooked on inside (test one before you take ALL out of oil)... if u want plain, roll in sugar, Nutella 4 choc 
1251 2018-05-24 21:29:07 IF YOU’RE IN A DEPRESSED SLUMP GET OUT OF BED DRINK A GLASS OF WATER AND GO OUT TO YOUR CAR AND CHECK THE OIL AND TIRE PRESSURE AND JUST LIKE THAT YOU ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN ATLEAST 25% OF THE POPULATION !

1254 2018-05-24 21:28:57 Islam is not a by product of saudi arabia. The Arabians are oil barons, they have no intention of ruling the west. Radical Muslims in the name of Islam want the west to become an Islamic culture. Starting from the leaders in councils to parliament. It's working for them
1255 2018-05-24 21:28:56 A bottle of oil? Are you sure it's not more like 3 or 4 tablespoons? Change that in your recipe cuz some people don't know how to cook
1256 2018-05-24 21:28:55 $40 total for mine! Not polarized but good quality, best anti-scratch/oil/reflective coating they offer + faster shipping.
1257 2018-05-24 21:28:55 Hope you’re at least trying cbd oil..I call it the Jesus plant..in some parts of America it’s still ridiculously called Life in Prison..not too late for you to change your mind..literally..
1258 2018-05-24 21:28:46 >For historically high-income countries, changes in IHD and stroke mortality rates from palm oil consumption were smaller (IHD: 17 deaths per 100,000 (95% CI [5.3-29]); stroke: 5.1 deaths per 100,000 (95% CI [-1.2-11.0])).

1260 2018-05-24 21:28:13 Celebrating my 3 year anniversary w/ my car today by Getting her an oil change & taking her on a trip to LA 
1261 2018-05-24 21:28:10 Vegetable oil made the world fat but bacon will kill everyone suuuuuuuuuuure.
1262 2018-05-24 21:28:05 Get your oil changed
1263 2018-05-24 21:27:50 I thought it was hashish oil he was caught with.
1264 2018-05-24 21:27:49 Wow, my total respect. My highlight is when I got around Photoshop, everything else goes over my head. (I'm too oldschool, oil and coal is my favourite) so really wow. Damn. Do I need to stalk ur acc for more pics?
1265 2018-05-24 21:27:43 Any VIA rant should include that GO Transit passengers get bumped off tracks and have to wait for VIA trains to pass as our morning story meeting gets underway. On train tracks it seems everyone is the little guy getting shoved (except oil?)
1266 2018-05-24 21:27:43 We have 2 Toyota Highlanders. Get about 25 MPG which isn’t bad. One of them has 190k miles and still runs like a dream. We haven’t had to do anything to them but change the oil and tires. Great vehicles

1269 2018-05-24 21:27:12 A large number of those oil and gas professionals who lost jobs have had their EI run out, and still unemployed. Curious to how and where they show in thee statistics?
1270 2018-05-24 21:27:11 Finally got the chance to use that 'vacuum' oil changer that I got for a gift over a year ago.
What A Piece of Shit.
It got maybe half the oil in the crankcase. Complete waste of money.
Just an expensive piece of trash in the garbage can now.
1271 2018-05-24 21:26:59 And you residents should donate vegetable oil na.
1272 2018-05-24 21:26:57 Only if and when oil rights come up for sale in Lakota country.
1273 2018-05-24 21:26:57 Quite right ,our vehicles used to run on crude oil prior to 2014
1274 2018-05-24 21:26:56 I was so proud of myself for finally getting my oil changed but then they asked me if I wanted to add on $200 worth of other things and I said no and now I feel irresponsible again..

1276 2018-05-24 21:26:43 Sure, but the hype around EVs is always meant to leave the impression that EVs are making a bigger impact on the market than they actually are. Part of the "hype-cycle," I know, but many of my readers ask how many years - not decades - until electricity displaces oil.
1277 2018-05-24 21:26:37 i would let you and every other libra pour hot oil on my back & i'd say thank you after. i love the superior sign

1282 2018-05-24 21:26:09 Hey, hi  @Audi i need a oil change coupon/special, please! 
1283 2018-05-24 21:26:06 Yes and there is so much more....especially in regard to oil, whisky and many other issues and matters. Political crooks was the wording used by an ex EU commissioner....she was spot on. #McCrone
1284 2018-05-24 21:26:02 You must have shorted a lot to have been helped by his tanking Obama's stock market recovery. Or do you work for an oil company getting rich off the 55% increase in oil prices over the last year?
1285 2018-05-24 21:25:59 Awe. Poor little guy was just looking for a good home.
1286 2018-05-24 21:25:42 Every 5 - 8 years Newsweek cycles between "Awash in Oil" and "Running Out Of Oil" headlines...
1287 2018-05-24 21:25:35 You're talking about Venezuela. Which runs a public ownership level between 30-40% The main chunk of it being oil production. Socialism isn't the cause of food shortages. It's disruption in the oil market and international sanctions for it's authoritarian gov.
1288 2018-05-24 21:25:15 My first experience with MCT oil has been nothing short of miserable
1289 2018-05-24 21:25:09 I can’t bring myself to pay that much for an oil change.

1291 2018-05-24 21:24:50 Oil companies will always look for an excuse to jack up gas prices. Trump has no problem giving them ones. Either directly or indirectly.  Just keep an eye on price per barrel  and you can see it.
1292 2018-05-24 21:24:46 V05 hot oil hair tubes. Are they still on ?
1293 2018-05-24 21:24:40 My coconut oil is always in liquid form. I forget it's even meant to be solid until I buy more at the store lol #floridaproblems
1294 2018-05-24 21:24:21 And if you really believe you can live in today’s world without oil then do it. And we won’t have to hear from you. No phone or computer right? Hold the pipeline company to account before during and after the project but let the oil flow. It drives the economy of the wholecountry

1297 2018-05-24 21:24:06 Hello Saad! Bloomberg were kind enough to reveal the capital structure. Production volumes, costs, tax are known or can be reasonably estimated; oil price a matter of opinion
1298 2018-05-24 21:24:06 I'v always said they hijacked the words "moderate" and "centrist", as the dictionary definition is opposite to a person, who supports a man torturing and killing millions for oil, while being outraged about a man appearing on TV in a country that hasn't attacked another in 300y.
1299 2018-05-24 21:23:47 Have you notice the price of OIL? I am getting tired of the WINNING tRUMP
1300 2018-05-24 21:23:40 Well there is one grandmother remedy I'm not doing. My mother's mother would have tryed to force me to take the biggest spoon ever of castor oil and cod liver oil & then take a Goldenseal. I'd  run down the block and far away and I would still do that today lol
1301 2018-05-24 21:23:39 Just make sure you are diluting it!!!!!!!! I cannot stress this enough. Undiluted essential oils will cause burns!!!! Also body shop has a great line of tea tree oil products for soothing acne prone skin, I like the 3-in-1 scrub/mask/wash
1302 2018-05-24 21:23:38 @BBCNews Mark Carney is charlatan someone needs to expose this snake oil salesman he's making it up as he goes along #Brexit means brexit #BankofEngland
1303 2018-05-24 21:23:37 Looking at S&P sectors, energy $XLE -1.4% is the day's big loser as oil drops 1.5%. Financials $XLF -0.7% are next in line in the loss column.

1306 2018-05-24 21:23:12 Tea tree oil had my skin on fire
1307 2018-05-24 21:23:11 Everyone
1308 2018-05-24 21:23:10 I have no problem whatsoever using oil money to get off oil. Fossil Fuels have done incredible things in advancing human technology and civilization. It's just unfortunately we've reached a point where they are unsustainable. It's time we worked hard at moving past them.
1309 2018-05-24 21:23:08 I put some tea tree oil on it...let’s see how that works out lol
1310 2018-05-24 21:23:00 OIL/gasoline price relationship - gasoline wants the Trump tax cut from the middle class?
1311 2018-05-24 21:22:30 $WTI July crude slid 1.6% to settle at $70.71/bbl, its third straight drop and the lowest finish since May 11, while Brent crude shed 1.3% to $78.79/bbl.
Energy stocks are hit with broad-based selling tied to the drop in oil prices:
1312 2018-05-24 21:22:20 Will the tax break cover the 25% increase in gas prices that Donnie just caused by pulling out of Iran deal and sanctioning the 2nd largest Arab oil exporter??
1313 2018-05-24 21:22:17 nothing makes the enbridge survey people hang up faster than telling them we need to divest from oil entirely
1314 2018-05-24 21:22:10 Crude oil prices tumbled today amid rising expectations that OPEC may look to boost production to make up for any supply shortfall out of Venezuela and Iran
1315 2018-05-24 21:22:10 Cars and auto parts are Canada's second-largest export after oil. Expect a little push back from Canada on this one.
1316 2018-05-24 21:22:08 @TheTodayShow Georgie, eucalyptus oil will do the trick, will remove any bad smell. I had a cat that continually peed on my handbags - mix it with some water and detergent, give a scrub, then dry in the sun.
1317 2018-05-24 21:22:05 No one really cares about us haha 

Well, they stopped on Monday and today we started feeling the consequences. 

I can't really blame them. Oil's been in the middle of one of the biggest corruption scandals here, now the government wants us to pay for their mistakes.
1318 2018-05-24 21:22:02 Costco should do oil changes 
1319 2018-05-24 21:22:00 I think it’s a mix of almond oil & dabur amla
1320 2018-05-24 21:21:59 Still doesnt know how to  present herself in front of the cameras after all these years!!! Miserable an certainly no oil paintin an never has been!!
1321 2018-05-24 21:21:55 I agree with you 100%. I hope all these oil companies that are to blame for this catastrophe get what they deserve.  What a disaster.
1322 2018-05-24 21:21:52 Damnit, not a Glock...

1326 2018-05-24 21:21:27 Just to be clear...you don’t consider melted butter an oil? Or you don’t like the taste of coconut oil?
1327 2018-05-24 21:21:23 You look amazing for burning the midnight oil!! ;)
1328 2018-05-24 21:21:22 oya come and collect hug...der is oil on ya' head!!!

1335 2018-05-24 21:20:46 Oshey Mr Castrol Engine oil!!!
1336 2018-05-24 21:20:37 I don’t drive a car and use natural gas locally sourced. Thx. However get it.  Worked in the oil and gas industry. I have seen blowups. We need to negotiate and find the best way for all.
1337 2018-05-24 21:20:33 Who wouldn’t notice that hitting their car?!
1338 2018-05-24 21:20:20 They do need to listen. do u think they r at war in d middle east for such empty words as democracy?! Humanitarian intervention is just a deceptive term to fool their ppl to consent to their waging wars&gaining money.they need a market for their products& to obtain oil  cheaply
1339 2018-05-24 21:20:19 Hair flowing down with the viscosity of a fountain of oil

1343 2018-05-24 21:20:01 Lmao, so "peak oil" is an infallible falsehood
1344 2018-05-24 21:19:58 We certainly have the money to do that. If we took the 3.3 billion ANUALLY that Canada uses to subsidize the oil industry, it would be more than enough.
1345 2018-05-24 21:19:57 That's not oil, it's urine.
1346 2018-05-24 21:19:54 Except, no one escapes.
1347 2018-05-24 21:19:49 Good! May it always be so. The squeaky gate gets the oil.
1348 2018-05-24 21:19:49 He got 3 hostages released & his tough talk did that. Peddle this snake oil somewhere else.

1350 2018-05-24 21:19:42 They want to rule Earth because data is the new oil.
1351 2018-05-24 21:19:41 30%? How is that even remotely possible when oil sands only accounts for 0.15% of current global carbon emissions? 

Just how big do you think this pipe is?

FYI: if it’s 7 fold increase that means total emissions would be 1.05% of global emissions.

If it comes a time where you need to lessen your stock as to not overcrowd, get them in a bag and slowly add clove oil to euth them. not pleasant, but for the fish it sometimes has to be done

1362 2018-05-24 21:18:34 You mean, American, right? Presumably you’re referring to the Trans Mountain Pipeline - Kinder Morgan’s Texas-based conduit for Alberta’s dirty tar sands “oil”. Not only in BC, but around the world, people are demanding an end to the outmoded, dangerous reliance on fossil fuels.
1363 2018-05-24 21:18:29 That sinking feeling when your turbo goes out and #Chevrolet refuses to honor the warranty and says the part failed because of not doing oil changes, which I have never missed. This is why domestic vehicles are shit. Fuck #Chevy

1367 2018-05-24 21:18:07 6. News, officials, etc spending their energy exclusively on Trump smoke and mirrors, so no work being done to educate public, improve legislation, or handle economy/oil/ disasters.

You don’t care about humanity.  Stop worrying about election instead deliver food and much needed medicine.

1389 2018-05-24 21:14:50 Yuk! Clapped out lying creep book seller of the sickliest snake oil variety reeking of cowardice, feeling safe in female 'flower bed'. Reminds me of a guy at a bar in 'western' movies who turns and snears.. speaks his turgid one-liner.. then gets shot.. and nobody cares a hoot.
1390 2018-05-24 21:14:23 Just washed and oiled my scalp down with peppermint oil. I’m feeling gawdly ok?
1391 2018-05-24 21:14:03 Sorry what unsubstantiated claims did I make that are refuted in this article? I didn't mention oil imports. I merely noted that a city of 12 million was able to completely switch from diesel to electric transportation in just 8 years. The tech is there.

1394 2018-05-24 21:13:46 Trump’s son-in-Law manufactured a crisis in Qatar that raised oil prices to benefit Putin.
1395 2018-05-24 21:13:43 Not sure if they will have CBD oil but you may want to check vape shops, I know I saw it at one place
1396 2018-05-24 21:13:40 The Oil Price Spike in our oil prices have NOTHING to do w/ the Middle East 
& EVERYTHING to do with a Greedy, UnControlled Wall Street w/ NO REGS set on Oil Futures Gambling

We, the US, thru Ramped Up production of our OWN OIL FIELDS, have made sourcing  extra Fuel a Moot Point
1397 2018-05-24 21:13:40 Obviously, you should use coconut oil, instead. You're welcome.
1398 2018-05-24 21:13:31 A lot of that art has that oil painted look, and I love it.
1399 2018-05-24 21:13:28 What’s your expected cost of May power now? Delivery restriction for gas in oil sands region and no offers for power. I don’t want to keep trying to prove my argument, but like I said, one week of unaccounted for peak power will cost the province its entire power cap budget
1400 2018-05-24 21:13:27 I constantly complain about how broke I am, but I also spent my last $60 on CBD oil for my 16 year old arthritic cat.

1404 2018-05-24 21:13:08 Perhaps with the unspent money we could develop a credible conventional home defence. As a result of decoupling from an oil based economy we could develop friends around the planet. To whom we could market the clean tech we’ve manufactured and developed. Impossible?

1410 2018-05-24 21:12:13 I grew up country, but I also grew up saying my words right so it irks me when someone says “ol” instead of “oil” & “tamata” instead of “tomato” like

1413 2018-05-24 21:12:02 i was hoping to read while i waited for my oil change to be done but the tv is so loud that i can’t concentrate. oh well.
1414 2018-05-24 21:11:42 “Change ur own damn oil” I love it 
1415 2018-05-24 21:11:39 that’s rich, coming from someone who doesn’t actually have to work or produce anything for his paycheck...just keeps writing garbage and cashing his W TX oil checks
1416 2018-05-24 21:11:30 Sue until there is a better alternative to oil, it will continue to be used worldwide regardless of whether KM is built or not. Let's make it Cdn oil. We should spend more time advocating for and developing alternatives to oil instead of tilting at pipelines.
1417 2018-05-24 21:11:26 cuando en un pais no se respetan las leyes y se violan descaradamente el gobierno cualesquiera que sea se hace ilegitimo y sus funcionarios usurpan los cargos que ocupan y si eso se hace repetidas veces sin recato pasa a ser un gobierno forajido.

This is a bad look for @Arsenal and loses us much moral high ground vis à vis Russian oligarchs, oil dictatorships, Israeli arms dealers etc. For shame.

1421 2018-05-24 21:11:05 Chris all this is a smoke screen! Russia is giving oil to north Korea. Ok Putin is all in this . Kim is  a killer dictator. He wants our country so does all the red commies.

1423 2018-05-24 21:10:55 This time it's a bit different. Few months ago China changed their basis for oil purchases from $US to yuan. That was a catalyst for $US strengthening & oil started track higher.
1424 2018-05-24 21:10:54 Not as many as America kills indiscriminately for oil, letting our children die at government schools the only education we fund is the military to sell our babies to harm. we don't regulate harmful chemicals   in our food + water because of corruption.Putin is forcing us to look
1425 2018-05-24 21:10:47 Thanks 2 whoever LIED about baby oil getting old tan off cos not only did I stand here full body lubed up then hit the deck in the shower cos it’s so slippy but the tan didn’t come off  propa good time

1427 2018-05-24 21:10:30 I'm perplexed, how is this going to alter anything. The oil companies provide it, we burnt it. The polluter stares back at you from the mirror every day.

1435 2018-05-24 21:09:58 perhaps (likely?!) the #CTax was oversold as a social licence, but it did help gain support for AB oil, and the revenue is being put to good use. it's equally likely that the opposition is unfairly criticizing its effectiveness
1436 2018-05-24 21:09:56 have you ever tried anything from the ordinary? or taken evening promise oil? those are slowly helping mine x

1443 2018-05-24 21:08:40 You can put castor oil on your waves. I use coconut oil though.

1450 2018-05-24 21:07:40 Revenue is the important part.   1.62% of revenue on $60 oil.

Who gives a crap about net revenue when gross revenue is the only part that matters.

1454 2018-05-24 21:07:27 My father distributes cannabis oil thats legal and its quite helpful to people. It does alot of what other medicines do and costs less than alot of medicine. For this reason the pharaceutical businesses are pressuring politicians to get the oil banned so they can make more money.

1459 2018-05-24 21:07:06 There it is!!! Bottom line. Congress better get busy and late oil burning this is above what they got us in now. They haven’t clue on this they better get experienced negotiaters. They need to be quite and stay off TV. @CNNPolitics @CBSNews @AC360 @donlemon @mkraju
1460 2018-05-24 21:07:02 Could we define what is meant by #realchange? We're not keeping Paris accords, no electoral reform and oil is king. Seems kinda the same...
1461 2018-05-24 21:06:49 Oof. No, that's not for me. No oil

1464 2018-05-24 21:06:47 LOL.  Everything on that list is found in abundance elsewhere.  If North Africa disappeared tomorrow, nobody would notice.  Chickpeas, Gold, and Oil is grown or found in abundance elsewhere.
1465 2018-05-24 21:06:43 At the airport, the lady next to me heard that I had a migraine and offered to 'annoint' me with special peppermint lavender oil. I smell delicious now.. and I think the entire plane will also be aware of this fact.

1474 2018-05-24 21:05:15 OMG I’ve figured it out.  @realDonaldTrump fucks up the US with dumb policies -> oil prices increase—> Russia GDP + wealth of oligarchs increase  -> trumps gets a cut & Putin lets him in the real billionaire club.
1475 2018-05-24 21:05:13 Well think about who owns oil they are all out to bring him down!
1476 2018-05-24 21:05:11 North America does not need any more refineries. Refining capacity is perfectly adequate for our needs (which are actually likely dropping). Raw oil can be refined into a plethora of fuels/substances. Shipping refined product to far away markets isn’t economically sound.
1477 2018-05-24 21:04:57 Good point! Beef production is very inefficient for protein conversion but profitable and the farmers follow the price signal. Others are very efficient (oil palm) but have large environmental costs that are not borne by the farmers or consumers :-)

1493 2018-05-24 21:02:26 Actual cost of crude oil is approx ₹32. If you take logistics, refinery and distribution it doubles up the cost. Then taxes are applied. Just for your info.
1494 2018-05-24 21:02:11 Neither I wud rather hav geothermal factories, solar power, wind power, tidal generators, geothermal pipes plugged into the buried mountains of garbage, kinetic energy tiles, interconnected electrical grid systems to ev cars all of which r already/becoming cheaper than oil

1496 2018-05-24 21:02:02 Did you reduce it when crude fell to $40? That time you increased taxes 8 times giving logic of needing for poor!!! Are we all crazy? Now when it is rising you are twisting narrative around poor again? Reduce taxes as much you increased when oil fell,  it will come down by 25.

1499 2018-05-24 21:01:28 Yeah definitely. It was for an oil and gas company. Inputs to the app were drilling rig locations and schedules, output of the app was a forecast of natural gas production (using a reservoir model libked to a pipeline model).

1504 2018-05-24 21:01:07 I dont think any oil producing country bae norway has good govs. Abs awful govs rule these countries, simply because they aint reliant on the people and their taxes to run things so the govs all become independent & non-democratic. Only way  is to not spend oil money at all.

1506 2018-05-24 21:01:01 Since oil prices are in part a function of regional stability and Trump's actions have increased the instability, it's fair to blame him.

1512 2018-05-24 21:00:43 I learned a great variation from a chef friend...pour a little olive oil in the skillet or on the griddle. It sure makes the edges of the toasted cheese yummy.
1513 2018-05-24 21:00:43 @armstrongcbc If Cenovus and the other oil companies want to ship their oil east or west, why don't they build refineries in Alberta so that the pipeline question will go away and they can get the world price for refined petroleum? It's not our job to take all the risk. #cdnpoli
1514 2018-05-24 21:00:39 Well, Its hard to agree with you bcos even now, British oil companies are only taking the oil in #Biafra land why abandoning the owners of the land. So for them, its about the resources as they are not concerned about the people.

1520 2018-05-24 21:00:18 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats

1522 2018-05-24 21:00:02 Whether butter fat or coconut oil, you end up with an emulsification. With its lower melting point, coconut oil actually emulsifies more easily. And goes better with whipping cream.

1527 2018-05-24 20:59:37 At this place advertising $19.99 oil changes and still have to pay 60
1528 2018-05-24 20:59:15 Tried Hello Fresh.  Meat had funny smell just about all the time.  Green veg was usually wilted.  Stopped after several weeks of not so great stuff.  Tried Blue Apron first..lot of olive oil.  Just received Home Chef.  Trying to night.
1529 2018-05-24 20:59:11 When it comes to olive oil for cooking, I wouldn't use "Extra virgin olive oil" , is has a low smoke point so it could burn a bit and affect the flavor. If you're going to cook with extra virgin olive oil make sure it's done on low heat otherwise use another kind of oil
1530 2018-05-24 20:59:10 I’m trying to guilt Jer into buying us an air fryer bc his deep fryer makes the entire apartment smell like vegetable oil and it’s gross (also I want to air fry everything!!!!!!)
1531 2018-05-24 20:59:09 West is way behind in its regime change programme expect all kinds of tricks to discredit Syria and Russia    they need Syria for the oil that's it nothing more
1532 2018-05-24 20:58:44 Doesn’t it depend on the cause of high gas prices?  I’m a mechanism guy myself.  Sometimes the President starts a war or threatens to cuts off an oil rich country from global markets. Seems like they deserve partial credit at times.
1533 2018-05-24 20:58:41 Not true. Royalty rates are 1-9% pre-payout and then 25-40% of net revenue after payout. These are sliding royalties based on oil pricing.
1534 2018-05-24 20:58:26 I've just read that they are good for skin conditions. Feel well and truly pampered, added a bit of lavender oil for a bit of relaxation.

1538 2018-05-24 20:58:09 You’re repeating unfounded figures. Oil has increased again anyway but 300m isn’t needed for the currency. Uk has massive debt compared to reserves so how does that work in your assertion?
1539 2018-05-24 20:58:09 I have dry skin too.. so after I wash  I moisturize with coco butter or coconut oil
1540 2018-05-24 20:58:08 Bob, Some years ago at Imperial Oil we made a deliberate effort to include early career female engineers on our campus recruitment and screening teams. Numbers of highly qualified female new hires went up almost directly.
1541 2018-05-24 20:58:01 When one power falls, another rises. Just applied / got recruited as a Roughneck. Guess I'm off to the oil fields. I got the change I was looking for. lol — feeling awesome

1547 2018-05-24 20:56:30 But being able to develop our own oil fields reduces the dependence on the middle East. Perhaps that's why you went along with Obama putting our oil fields out of reach so foreigners would be able to dictate terms of our surrender. Your just spewing BS.
1548 2018-05-24 20:56:28 Seems to me. The Rich and Europe and USA want him gone to split the oil and minerals this country is known for. The poor don't matter.

1573 2018-05-24 20:52:12 All I am saying is that you can call it atrocious only when you explain it why. Comparing the prices around the world doesn't give you a clear picture. You should consider the trade agreements with oil nations, trade offs with inflating various goods in short and long terms
1574 2018-05-24 20:51:52 hehe fwiw when i lived in germany most salad dressing came in packets (you add oil to it, etc.) -- check the packet/seasoning aisle next time if you're still interested?

2. Cod liver oil

1603 2018-05-24 20:49:31 For years,  Alberta’s PC politicians wrecklessly spent all revenue from oil companies.  ThIs wealth was generated by oil workers from Alberta & elsewhere.  When cyclical oil price/demand dropped, those workers & others suffered as PC’s cut back programs designed to help.

1608 2018-05-24 20:48:56 Humans are such a strange species. We exploit our surroundings, resources, as well as other species. We not only steal honey from bees, we farm them to steal drums of it to sell to other humans for profit. We dig the earth to extract oil, which we then burn to pollute the air.
1609 2018-05-24 20:48:45 Actually you don’t have one clue, it is was and always will be about OPEC control and Saudi Arabia. They want their oil soaked in blood to be sold. Smiling Buffett owns all rail in North America that is why CN is training hundreds of Engineers.
1610 2018-05-24 20:48:32 The oil bounty was blown up by the utter price collapse (notwithstanding it's gone up recently) which stamped the idea on people Scotland HAD dodged a bullet. Brexit which is many times simpler than Inde.. has torpedoed that lie as well.

1614 2018-05-24 20:47:53 There’s exaggerated facts on both sides. So how do we accept each other’s presence & input, find common ground & create a plan that doesn’t just include oil? Then shake hands & move on with stalled projects?
1615 2018-05-24 20:47:52 I think the right counterfactual is what would happen to prices if you *didn't* have domestic oil production setting one new record after another.
1616 2018-05-24 20:47:51 Now, it is the time to investigate which chinese company use US technology to help Iron oil production. We want to know that.

1618 2018-05-24 20:47:41 @OnTheMoneyCBC Peter, every time you get an oil executive on and talk about how important oil is to Canada's future, you assume we are going to have one! Climate change is real and if we don't move away from oil we won't have a future.
1619 2018-05-24 20:47:35 I agree in fact I think oil is a dying market, and renewable energy is a rapidly growing market.

1630 2018-05-24 20:46:12 You supported oil drilling off our coast. You don't protect, you abuse the environment.
1631 2018-05-24 20:46:09 They are regressive. If we are going to have higher prices, tax carbon and return it to low and middle incomes. Net effect of zero or positive. And much better than oil companies profiting
1632 2018-05-24 20:46:08 What are the product of destructive distillation of crude oil?
1633 2018-05-24 20:45:56 Read about Aramco.  They are a big reason that oil/gasoline is up this year.  Yes, clearly the market is manipulated ;)
1634 2018-05-24 20:45:54 That view is , I think supported , by Mr Salmond's oft repeated phrase that *we started campaigning at 28% &got to 45%* that implies not far from half are definitely not hard core, at any price, types..but were persuaded...IMO by the oil bounty idea coupled with it being easy...
1635 2018-05-24 20:45:47 Have you contacted @Ayokaade_ for your affordable oil perfumes ? 

You should. She’s the real plug
1636 2018-05-24 20:45:42 So I don't know if you've tweeted this before and I didn't see it, but I had no clue about your peanut allergy. It has to suck living with such a deadly allergy, especially considering how many places have peanuts or use peanut oil.

1642 2018-05-24 20:44:41 Are you sure there aren't a few barrels of oil under there, Zinke?
1643 2018-05-24 20:44:39 No, it is NOT dumb in this case. Trump deliberately broke the Iran deal which will result in the removal of Iranian oil from world markets.  Less supply = higher prices. 

The removal of Iranian oil has not happened yet but the stock markets bid up the price in anticipation.
1644 2018-05-24 20:44:32 Now, it is the time to investigate which chinese company use US technology to help Iron oil production.
1645 2018-05-24 20:44:31 Last 10 years worked in Angola,Congo,Equatorial Guinea,Nigeria all oil rich country's but still mass povity

Yet in Venezuela they are eating their house hold pet's due to lack of food. so some of them facts do not stack up.
1646 2018-05-24 20:44:27 Do you remember Pres Obama said we could never drill our way to energy dependence?  Well, we did.  My point is that energy, compared to all other daily expenses, is cheap. Oil is up because Aramco is pushing oil prices up to benefit their public offering later this year.

1653 2018-05-24 20:44:01 Cucumber slices with olive oil and generous amounts of sea salt
1654 2018-05-24 20:43:55 Especially PBR. That thing hasnt moved much on higher oil for many years.
1655 2018-05-24 20:43:46 Found out I'm allergic to bottle of oil
1656 2018-05-24 20:43:40 Too many new products. Please just start off with Rosehip Oil and gradually introduce other products
1657 2018-05-24 20:43:38 But what will happen if the truck drivers won't end the strike anytime soon? How will the fuel be transported and used without resorting to another oil price hike to cover the business lost in the first place because of the strike? It's just go round and round, it's confusing.
1658 2018-05-24 20:43:30 Nah, olive oil isn't good for deep-frying unless you get it extra light.

Instead, go for sunflower, safflower, canola, or peanut oil.
1659 2018-05-24 20:43:17 Add to that the fact that oil production is a major part of the Russian economy and our current POTUS is essentially a pawn for the Russian oligarchs whose wealth is highly tied to oil sales
1660 2018-05-24 20:43:15 @FarOutAkhtar  Sir without taking any help can I just ask if you know which make of oil India imports? And the oil basket in imports for india is priced averaging how many months oil prices?

1668 2018-05-24 20:42:46 Does the Brazilian government control the price of diesel? Gas prices are usually dictated by the cost of crude oil, and I’m really curious how they will fix this.
1669 2018-05-24 20:42:44 Those who want PMB out are those who doesn't want our power to function 
Our economy to improve 
Our security to improve 
Our Agriculture to improve 
Our railway to function 
Our Ajaokuta steel company to function 
Our national carrier to function 
Our non oil sector to function
1670 2018-05-24 20:42:42 But high gas prices are fundamentally a good thing, because it will give the incentive to reduce emissions. I support the Iran Deal, but if its cancellation leads to oil staying in the ground, then is a good thing.
1671 2018-05-24 20:42:35 All those promises are possible w/o oil as your diversified economy makes for a stronger resilience in boom/bust cycles. Face it already. You've got the costliest poorest quality tar and are doubling down with fracking when you're water challenged.
1672 2018-05-24 20:42:26 Yeah. Well it's really just the gel but I use the oil to prevent drying since in probe to that.

Anyhow it's always something with other methods I've used: flaking, clumping, etc.
1673 2018-05-24 20:42:24 LOL - only time Cons care about social programs. Doing just fine without added risk thanks. Also, have you any idea how many health proplems are caused by the oil industry, how much added burden that puts on healthcare and social probelms? Lung cancer, heart disease, Alzheimers..
1674 2018-05-24 20:42:11 Listen people, the transmountain question is not a referendum on the entire oil industry. Given the cries of doom and gloom from pro industry talking heads it's no wonder investment is running. 
Wrong pipeline
Wrong place

1680 2018-05-24 20:41:56 Ontario was screwed with Canada because the less than legal embargo oil was no longer passed onto Russian tankers. Ontario’s industry was just gutted by unions and would never survive.

1684 2018-05-24 20:41:39 The fact I have to remove an aero panel just to change my oil is fucking stupid.
1685 2018-05-24 20:41:35 Venezuela's key problem, in my opinion, is an over-reliance on oil exports to pay for their social programme. Relying on a commodity that is exported whose price is set by OPEC and others is asking for trouble. When that oil price hit $35 a barrel everything hit the fan.
1686 2018-05-24 20:41:34 Not having much knowledge on it. Saw that barrel crude oil rates were lesser than congi times so don't you think it should reflect on the price?
1687 2018-05-24 20:41:27 Putting Iran policy aside, it does show that record US oil production cannot produce low gasoline prices. Gasoline prices hit 4 year highs just as domestic oil production sets one new record after another.
1688 2018-05-24 20:41:21 That's probably the girls that don't use oil and other shit.

1695 2018-05-24 20:40:26 The whole dispute is about spills & cleanup process. Crude oil, jet fuel, etc all float. Bitumin does not. It sinks & spreads on the bottom (at least from what I've read). Putting skin in the game for spill response would go a lot further than threats of trade wars

1785 2018-05-24 20:29:55 Lol i don’t really have a set hair care routine. 
I use oils like Amla oil, coconut oil and this other brand called Pure Royal and I switch up my shampoo and conditioner a lot.
1786 2018-05-24 20:29:53 Any portmanteau of engineering just sounds so utterly pretentious. I think I resent this more because I see people talk about "vision" as a thing when it's often just snake oil or a grandiose view of "an idea".
1787 2018-05-24 20:29:51 That’s exactly what I think of this as also. 200 years ago, he’d be moving from town to town selling snake oil out of his wagon. And dumb white Christians would have been buying that also.
1788 2018-05-24 20:29:51 Oil prices  do to cartel in Middle East...thinkhow muchworse it would have hurt without that tax break..
1789 2018-05-24 20:29:49 Nations have been built on sales, taxes and jobs created from the sale of oil too. Yet so many developed without it. That's the alternative. 

Genuinely curious, name nations that WERE BUILT on the alcohol business?
1790 2018-05-24 20:29:41 I was using the shea moisture maracuja beard wash oil and balm. Lately I been going with an olive oil leavein conditioner and some straight coconut oil
1791 2018-05-24 20:29:33 Be careful with the hot oil
1792 2018-05-24 20:29:30 Either it’s your oil, or either just an engine light which means your car could of been too hot or etc, or if so check in at your local garage etc mate
1793 2018-05-24 20:29:22 Abt to get this hot oil treatment popping.

1799 2018-05-24 20:29:08 @elonmusk The population of Brazil is being overwhelmed by the oil industry. Please help us. We need smarter transportation alternatives.

1810 2018-05-24 20:27:30 But doing business in gold will cost them a fortune because they will get only part of the value that’s why they had rather do it with oil and gas like they did for over 25 years
1811 2018-05-24 20:27:24 Anointing oil
1812 2018-05-24 20:27:22 I just sliced it and shallow fried in olive oil until it was golden brown. Only takes a couple of minutes on each side — quick and easy 
1813 2018-05-24 20:27:12 Quickfire question: Is there anything cod liver oil CAN'T do?

1815 2018-05-24 20:27:06 COCONUT OIL !!!!
1816 2018-05-24 20:26:59 Two or three oil wells
1817 2018-05-24 20:26:49 Why do they keep recommending coconut oil for EVERY DIY product they make? I’m certainly not in the “slander coconut oil” camp because I know it actually does work for many people’s faces/hair/lips, but I do not think it should a default recommendation for DIY products
1818 2018-05-24 20:26:30 Mood! I like the eco style olive oil one. It works when I mix it with conditioner, but it might not work for others. Ppl are nuts!
1819 2018-05-24 20:26:23 Our oil company's are exporting most of our oil out of the country.   Fuel economy standards are being cut by Trump which in turn makes us more dependent on oil and raises our gas prices!  Good job Trump voters!  Great time for oil company's!
1820 2018-05-24 20:26:09 Just because he hasn't let you, the world or Kim know exactly what his plan is doesn't mean he doesn't have one.
1821 2018-05-24 20:26:04 Nice attempted at branding Donnie, I'm not buying it. Stick to selling steaks you snake oil salesmen!
1822 2018-05-24 20:25:19 ever since yesterday's stream i messed with the brushes in procreate and i think i found my new default pbrush when i add color and shit.  the oil paint brush is so good! easy to mix etc.

1824 2018-05-24 20:25:18 It’s still oil.
1825 2018-05-24 20:24:49 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1826 2018-05-24 20:24:30 Trump made sure Big Oil will make record profits with gas prices going up daily. Trumps owned by NRA and Big Oil
1827 2018-05-24 20:24:28 You do realize that you are making claims that even the mendacious oil companies wouldn't make? Whoever is paying your fees must be awfully embarrassed by your BS.
1828 2018-05-24 20:24:20 Selling her talent (dancing, acting, hosting, presentation etc) and her intellectual property, am sure you wouldn't understand all these, it mustn't be hair, bleaching creams or oil and glasses
1829 2018-05-24 20:24:20 Don’t cut it off again, use wild hair growth oil & stay natural & moisturizer & your curls should go back bomb af
1830 2018-05-24 20:24:19 Wats  a home read the oil
1831 2018-05-24 20:24:15 Should he beg, telegraph everything, set deadlines, extend them constantly and then just accept whatever Kim offers like Obama/Kerry?
1832 2018-05-24 20:24:14 GE's Fukushima's nuclear reactors has now been pumping dangerous Nuclear waste into the Pacific Ocean daily for SEVEN years, but they protest a possible local Oil spill and ignore future Cancers+ Birth Defects? How much does GE Corp donate to these Protests?
1833 2018-05-24 20:24:13 Actually hope we fall, then get a rise we catch so that we can make more.....for the big short of the summer :)
1834 2018-05-24 20:24:11 Maybe supplements are just snake oil for suckers?
1835 2018-05-24 20:24:02 Yup.  It's not about what's right when it comes to these assholes.  It's about winners and losers. 
If we could harness the power of spite, Trump and his cultists could end our dependence on oil within a week.
1836 2018-05-24 20:23:56 Patrick,  my roomie swears she can taste pot oil, and I'm getting fed up with smelling the skunkweed. Is there a dish I can make where she wouldn't taste the oil?
1837 2018-05-24 20:23:54 This is a shameful misrepresentation of the original report which reported no significant change following a canola oil diet supplement in predisposed mice. @senseaboutsci
1838 2018-05-24 20:23:53 Where does this leave the oil industry?
1839 2018-05-24 20:23:44 compared to executives in healthcare (opioids), guns, oil and gas? It’s not even close. There are much better examples to target. He got rich through innovation, not by stifling innovation like in other industries (energy).
1840 2018-05-24 20:23:41 in the mood for chugging chicken oil from mang inasal
1841 2018-05-24 20:23:21 all I'm doing is pan frying some chicken but for some reason it's just the most stressful thing I've ever done???? I tried using butter the first time but that burnt too fast and was a fucking mess. so this time I opted to use oil and the oil also burned!!!! how!!! on medium heat
1842 2018-05-24 20:23:18 Francis churches  and Colleges Only Opec Oil Keeps All Of Pope Francis Schools Thru College Degrees PHD Included All Paid  WITH OPEC OIL Currency Globally This will never End or Change no

1846 2018-05-24 20:22:52 Coming from a guy who wouldnt know where to begin to change the oil in his car......
1847 2018-05-24 20:22:51 Oil changes on men's vehicles sync up just like women's periods do.
1848 2018-05-24 20:22:23 Lovely burner, but get that wood away from it!!! Anyway, hes talking bollicks. Most town homes just as badly insulated as country homes. And our (oil fired) central heating for whole house is cheaper than bought wood for the living room fire.
1849 2018-05-24 20:22:22 Like oil down Aaron's beard
1850 2018-05-24 20:22:21 I didn't use my facial oil so often so there you go, dark spots........
1851 2018-05-24 20:22:09 Oil is up all the world not in india
1852 2018-05-24 20:21:53 If anybody could’ve saw me snapping about not getting my car registration renewal back, thinking my stickers expired & that I have to get the state inspection by next week, thinking I need new brakes & oil... they would’ve just laughed bc none of that is true lmao
1853 2018-05-24 20:21:48 Thought I was a big man with my tanning oil and no sun cream earlier but really I’m not cus I’m burnt to a fucking crisp n cant move

1859 2018-05-24 20:21:19 This is global #Climate Change friendly propaganda. He's hitting right wing media w his oil and gas BS.
1860 2018-05-24 20:21:09 Put tanning oil on the affected area 
1861 2018-05-24 20:21:03 Cmon man, you forget I know how smart you are. Scientists do defend their work. It’s called research and following scientific process. What they aren’t trained to do is defend against big oil funded confusion campaigns and multi million $ media spend to cloud the issue! 1/2
1862 2018-05-24 20:21:03 That is patently false. We are there to take resources away such as drugs and oil. We are not obligated to fight alongside allies such as Israel who we already give billions to every year. War is to keep the pentagon and bankers rich. They always manage to "lose" trillions.
1863 2018-05-24 20:20:48 The oil is the key  
1864 2018-05-24 20:20:39 Do phone calls increase production capacity?  If no, have a tea and netflix, cause it won't be worth the time to dial.
Want to get "more oil"?  Pay what it costs to produce more oil.
OPEC+ using spare capacity, to + crude demand, is the worst possible solution to "more oil".
1865 2018-05-24 20:20:30 My “Meal Prepping” is shaving my pum pum and lathering myself in coconut oil before my boo comes over.
1866 2018-05-24 20:20:22 Geez , so much depending on a fiscally risky project by a struggling Texas oil company in a 2.2% of Cds'a GDP industry
1867 2018-05-24 20:20:18 This coconut oil got my waves spinning like a mf 
1868 2018-05-24 20:20:13 No parking lot has more oil stains than an auto parts store

1871 2018-05-24 20:20:00 I'm gonna start vaping beard oil
1872 2018-05-24 20:19:57 I didn’t have to put this much coconut oil in my hair 
1873 2018-05-24 20:19:57 I imagine historians are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of absurdity and atrocity is mind boggling. They must be exhausted, I am!!!!
1874 2018-05-24 20:19:56 Yes they can do. But that’s not good for the currencies of those countries with lower rates, as people would sell the £ for the $ to buy US bonds for example, thus crashing the £ and causing inflation in any goods (eg oil/gas/gold/food and most commodities) prices in $
1875 2018-05-24 20:19:46 I have a face mask on, coconut oil in my hair, and I’m about to exfoliate, shave then throw on some cute panties and do my makeup. I feel like a bad ass bitch
1876 2018-05-24 20:19:44 Ugh I always forget how much of a blow up even oil changes are for my car. I wish I didn't have a foreign 
1877 2018-05-24 20:19:38 Harare East, we don't deserve such an MP we are voting him out and for good. Your cooking Oil you dished out during primaries will not save you Mukupe
1878 2018-05-24 20:19:29 Gretzky quote and investing, not exactly great, I remember investing during the tech bubble and bust, I am on both sides, solar on my house, he furnace/AC but I view oil as the only viable fuel for heavy truck/equipment and aircraft so why not get the biggest value while we can
1879 2018-05-24 20:19:29 Use castor oil for base
1880 2018-05-24 20:19:22 Pics that I click looks like oil paint. No natural look. Wish to ditch. #SoundsLikeMe

1882 2018-05-24 20:19:19 Ocean spill risk is ZERO? OK, now you aren't even trying to tell the truth. Even oil companies don't pretend that there will be zero chance of dilbit spills from tankers off the coast (or at the terminal, for that matter).
1883 2018-05-24 20:19:16 I know my car had a million things wrong with it but I just want an oil change man
1884 2018-05-24 20:19:10 Also, “paint” the pizza dough in olive oil in which you roasted some garlic.
1885 2018-05-24 20:19:09 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
1886 2018-05-24 20:19:08 That scene in "The Jerk" where M. Emmet Walsh is trying to shoot Steve Martin and Steve thinks he's shooting at the oil cans?
"HE HATES THESE CANS!"
That's how silly you jerks look when you claim that kneeling NFL players are "protesting the anthem" or that they "hate the flag."
1887 2018-05-24 20:19:04 A plan to make oil Oil preys upon the mutual benefit, but they call themselves The vertical axis and he ended up the cells
1888 2018-05-24 20:18:54 [grabs oil]
1889 2018-05-24 20:18:49 Exfoliate your face, neck and hands with a mixture of baking soda and olive oil. It is very gentle, and keeps skin very soft and smooth.
1890 2018-05-24 20:18:49 my heart stops! I can be there smelling oil and naphtha !! what times !!!
1891 2018-05-24 20:18:40 Smt ain nothing good to use let me go back to water and coconut oil
1892 2018-05-24 20:18:39 Honestly, everyone told me not to do this, But I slather peppermint essential oil all over my zits and they go away basically overnight
1893 2018-05-24 20:18:32 The feel good aspect of the following things is underrated 
1. New earphones 
2. New socks 
3. New underwear 
4. Oil change after service 
5. New brakes 
6. Smooth shifting transmission 
7. No notifications on your phone 
8. Fully checked off to-do list.
1894 2018-05-24 20:18:20 brain washed by the relentless false narrative from big oil and merchant refiners.  

they have been the bad guy for 100 years, they know how to play the game.
1895 2018-05-24 20:18:13 Thanos didn't give back the time stone when he took it from Dr Strange....if not, we'd have reversed time a bit for you to enjoy your hairline some more #lol

On a serious note, Cannabinoid oil and castor oil works though
1896 2018-05-24 20:18:04 The rich play the charity game for publicity. Signed filthy lazy. So lazy that it is my mind to say this fraud will soon stop. Please keep taking a picture of famine victims after breakfast and maintain your oil stocks.
1897 2018-05-24 20:18:02 If you have oil and yam who not??
1898 2018-05-24 20:17:57 I have a giant headache and I've been waiting for my car at the oil change/wash place for an hour and a half
1899 2018-05-24 20:17:56 A little hemp oil would get rid of that in about a week or so. But it gets kinda ugly before it clears up.
1900 2018-05-24 20:17:54 West's only sustainable path is monetary reform & debt restructuring.
Other paths lead to one big smoking hole - not success.

1903 2018-05-24 20:17:47 Do your Iraq deal on him.  We KNOW he has weapons of mass destruction, right?  Oh, thats right, he don't have any oil or other things of Capitalistic value to the 1% and their middle/upper middle class (paid for by taxes) cohorts in government.!

1905 2018-05-24 20:17:24 SAUDI ARABIA'S greatest fear is that IRAQ and IRAN dominating the OIL market, because tgey both have more OIL in barrels and untapped OIL that the UAE and,SAUDI ARABIA combined,  thats,the sole reason SAUDI ARABIA with the help of ISRAEL will provoke IRAN into am all OUT WAR,
1906 2018-05-24 20:16:58 How come a ten minute oil change takes twenty mins and costs $35 instead of the advertised $19.99?
1907 2018-05-24 20:16:54 this wild hair growth oil makes your hair grow but this shit itches so bad 
1908 2018-05-24 20:16:54 Thank you, I think it's very much a catch all term used to describe anything eaten with a utensil and not wet enough to be considered a soup. I don't know why else you would put tuna salad, ambrosia, and arugula tossed with olive oil in the same category
1909 2018-05-24 20:16:51  now that’s churchy that’s that little angel my mom had in her office and in the house growing up lol and yes to the oil!

1915 2018-05-24 20:15:57 I realized in the 70’s that until every last dollar from every last drop of oil is earned, the global oil power will work against new energy. They’ll ruin the planet doing it too. Thank God for Obama’s push into new, clean resources. We need to vote for these issues.
1916 2018-05-24 20:15:55 Na the oil is all legit, how he got it however is not but putins pal so he’s cool
1917 2018-05-24 20:15:54 I haved many "working class" clients who are millionaires. Need specific skills - tool and die maker, policemen, oil rig workers, etc. It is possible.

1926 2018-05-24 20:15:01 Something we're watching: 

Oil is up +42% y/y, a 9th decile historical move. Be mindful that forward +12 month
S&P returns have come in below average from this decile.

1929 2018-05-24 20:14:47 If we as tax payers wanted to have a gov oil company and pay for all costs associated with upstream and downstream operations then take in all profits thats a different story with many problems hurdles and pitfalls along the way and simply not viable at this point in time.
1930 2018-05-24 20:14:46 If you doubt people don't steal those part's, den maybe d transformer in your area have not been vandalized since inception, stealing electrical installation is big business just like oil bunkering
1931 2018-05-24 20:14:36 Clove essential oil! One drop in a shot glass of warm water! Swish it around UR mouth & hold it in place around the sore tooth. If the tooth is really sore U can drop the oil on a cotton swab and apply it directly to UR tooth. I just mailed some oils today. MSG me if need some.
1932 2018-05-24 20:14:28 The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
1933 2018-05-24 20:14:27 That’s ridiculous. We have the 3rd largest oil reserves in the world. Of course we should export it. A refinery will never be built in BC. 

You know we are a nation of resources the world needs. We don’t make bread from all the grain we grow, it’s exported.
1934 2018-05-24 20:14:19 Dont drink anymore. Dont wear makeup on my face anymore. Don’t drink soda anymore. I drink my water, Eat my veggies, use my coconut oil. Crazy how much healthier and energetic I feel now compared to 6 months ago just from making a few little changes .
1935 2018-05-24 20:14:13 I gotcha Mr. Mom.
1936 2018-05-24 20:14:12 Lame.  They rise every Memorial Day as a function of bipartisan gouging for summer vacation season.  Otherwise you're the one fighting oil and gas extraction every way you can, driving prices up and disadvantaging us in the global market.
1937 2018-05-24 20:14:11 Why are my oil changes $80.00.... I want to die a little inside.
1938 2018-05-24 20:13:47 I wonder if @realDonaldTrump has holdings in #oil or ownership in a #oilcompany because that #minuscule #taxcuts you gave me doesn’t cover the #higher #fuel #costs  27% higher already from last year #MAGA2018 #lol
1939 2018-05-24 20:13:44 I only change the nutsack oil once a week. I like a potent reminder of the mileage ive made over the week
1940 2018-05-24 20:13:44 Oil prices remained bullish throughout the week, crude price slipped during the early session on Thursday after a slight rise  in the U.S. oil inventories which rose by 5.8 mill barrels last week to a total of 438.1 mill barrels following a forecast of a 1.4 mill barrel decline.

1950 2018-05-24 20:12:34 I will literally go camping 
1951 2018-05-24 20:12:27 Our money? I though you were the chemist in Langley or is this you, lobbying for big oil in the municipal political arena now?
1952 2018-05-24 20:12:23 So are you saying let the oil come by train instead, because that's what will happen. And in the meantime, why not shut yourself off from the improved std of living Cda gets from fossil fuels as one of our main exports...and stop driving your car and heating your home with them.
1953 2018-05-24 20:12:11 Sub 50 by August and I’ll be a happy camper 
1954 2018-05-24 20:11:50 You're doing great boss. You guys even have your own functional 'Ajaokuta' steel company. More oil to your gorimapa.
1955 2018-05-24 20:11:46 I think I would defer to Coors Light for watery beer. I felt Michelob Ultra was like slightly skunky Perrier. But that was a while ago that I had one.
1956 2018-05-24 20:11:46 AFAIK, it can control only the OMC costs and Centra share of tax. Rest is with the states. Cost of barrel crude oil or exchange rate is literally out of govt control
1957 2018-05-24 20:11:36 2/2 I argued when they released their paper in 2014 that a lot of their oil sands shutdown was driven by that assumption. Your supply cost graph makes that point in spades.
1958 2018-05-24 20:11:24 Oil prices  traded above the $70 per barrel over the last couple of weeks, close to $80 per barrel since last Friday’s session until recently, most  crude prices have slipped on reports from the U.S. Energy Information  Administration of a sudden rise in U.S. crude stockpiles.
1959 2018-05-24 20:11:15 Angela Lansbury was 59- 7 yrs older than Brooke- when she first starred in Murder, She Wrote.

Jean Stapleton was 48- 4 yrs YOUNGER than Brooke- when she first starred in All in the Family.

Jennifer Lopez is currently 49.

Times are indeed changing.
1960 2018-05-24 20:11:14 You cite McGlade and Ekins - worth noting that same work with your assumptions would get different results as you differentiate between costs of operating vs new oil sands products.  1/2

1964 2018-05-24 20:10:56 A company can only do welll if it isn’t treated like an ATM.. 

Unfortunately Govt forgets until 15-18 months ago it was almost loosing money pumping oil when it was $30-$40. 

Instead of making it a global powerhouse they make it India’s farm loan waiver machine.
1965 2018-05-24 20:10:55 I was doing lavender oil and then various lotions (coconut oil and some lubriderm type stuff they had at my job) to actually keep the scab hydrated and then the skin after.

1985 2018-05-24 20:08:57 There was no more damaging legislation 2 small businesses than the CFPB. Democrat snake oil
1986 2018-05-24 20:08:55 Our Coconut & Cream natural soap is made of coconut oil, sustainably harvested palm oil, olive oil, castor oil, safflower oil, coconut, organic coconut milk, cream, non-nanoparticle titanium dioxide and sum scent blend. All great, natural ingredients!

1988 2018-05-24 20:08:42 Blood for oil bro but like I said not another Maddox rifle will serve this country again, we've paid the price in full our account is closed. We're warriors but we won't fight for this country.
1989 2018-05-24 20:08:39 Why are you setting up the American people for another too big to fail scam and then allowing pharmaceutical companies to sell untested snake oil to the dying?  What is wrong with you people?
1990 2018-05-24 20:08:32 Hope you checked your oil levels
1991 2018-05-24 20:08:25 A man in the barbershop yesterday said, "Yeah back in my day people were hesitant to move and live in Oil City. They started to get some black people, and we didn't have any of those where I lived." !!!!
1992 2018-05-24 20:08:24 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.

1999 2018-05-24 20:07:53 Aww thx ,it's the  olive oil and spaghetti I owe it to tho
2000 2018-05-24 20:07:52 The world oil supply is falling . OPEC and trouble in the Middle East are to blame .

2006 2018-05-24 20:07:14 Lol. No. Twitter is, in fact, a public forum. That's a FACT, regardless of how you'd like to quibble over it's status as a "private company".

If it's "private" then it's LIABLE for it's content.  If it's not liable, then, it needs to be regulated like "private" oil and utilities

2010 2018-05-24 20:06:48 This is like that bumper sticker that says: "How's my driving? Call 1-800-eat-shit." All oil busimessmen should take their cocks, stick them up their own ass and fuck themselves.
2011 2018-05-24 20:06:40 Congrats on the weight loss. Have you roasted kale? A bit of olive oil, lemon juice, and sea salt. So delicious and crunchy.
2012 2018-05-24 20:06:30 You're going in the wrong direction, Sen. Wyden. Remove Big Oil subsidies and implement a national carbon tax. It can be revenue neutral at the start with payout via social security tax withholding reductions. Don't encourage more driving with lower gas prices!
2013 2018-05-24 20:06:28 Puff puff that is soaked with oil is top 10 one of the most disrespectful things I’ve tasted. Have some respect.
2014 2018-05-24 20:06:23 Most people don’t understand that the Russian economy is totally dependent on the global oil and gas prices. 

Russia was really suffering. This was a godsend for Putin and the oligarchs attempting to maintain their control and improve their wealth. 


2015 2018-05-24 20:06:20 #2 just isn't true. 19th century robber barons occurred in an era when government regulation was minimal. Standard Oil, for example. In the early 20th century, AT&T was a good example. Economies of scale and early market dominance are decisive.
2016 2018-05-24 20:06:14 Unfortunately people were all in for Snake Oil in 2016 & Russians knew it, they've been studying the destruction of our democracy for longer than Ive been alive, it was only going to take ONE good snake oil salesman, shyster to agree to play & it was Checkmate!  #WeAreASadNation
2017 2018-05-24 20:06:13 Eco styler with olive oil be having my waves POPPING! Nothing has happened to me or my hair. 
2018 2018-05-24 20:06:13 Ah I see. Last time gas was high was because our oil pipeline wasn't installed yet and we got most of our oil from the middle East. Prices won't be that high since the keystone Pipeline was finished. They'll top out here in about a month or so.

2026 2018-05-24 20:04:55 this man is a living breathing bottle of olive oil
2027 2018-05-24 20:04:53 This is a very serious question, that every citizens having the right to ask. With more than $500billion revenue from oil and nothing to show for it. No good road. No electricity or water supply. Serious poverty among the citizens. PDP should tell us, what happened to the money.
2028 2018-05-24 20:04:36 Idc if my car is on fire if i came for an oil change that’s all I’m getting
2029 2018-05-24 20:04:31 I got out of most of my oil stocks last week. So far,  looks like a good decision. Looking to get back in on a couple of them after some settling out.
2030 2018-05-24 20:04:30 High energy prices kill every nations` demand anywhere in the world except in the oil producing countries and stuff for IOU countries - championed by the US and its "reserve" currency.

2032 2018-05-24 20:04:18 2019 is in cowboy country, after all. The theme can be cowboys and oil titans. I’m from BC so I’ll just dress as a hippie (aka regular summer wardrobe) or maybe a tree.

2047 2018-05-24 20:03:14 Extracrion Solvent, no - but carrier - yes!
Small amounts of ethanol can carry respectable doses of #cannabinoids across the lining of the stomach for very fast delivery.
 In some cases, (IMO) ethanol is a better choice than oil based carriers
2048 2018-05-24 20:03:14 Tonight I got home from work, had a bath with my Jo Malone bath oil, got joggers and a hoody on on, ate some seafood linguini and a chocolate brownie & now I’m in bed drinking White Rioja and watching RHOBH #winning

2053 2018-05-24 20:02:00 We have already gone through this during the Klein years. The debt is growing because Klein never addressed Alberta’s revenue problems. He just cut cut cut. You can’t fully depend on Oil and gas to fund basic services like healthcare and education #ableg
2054 2018-05-24 20:01:41 Just leveled up as a mom when I washed the red sauce from the crevices of each of those 7 tortellinis and replaced it with olive oil and parmesan. See you at the quarter finals, other moms. 
2055 2018-05-24 20:01:32 Pipes and refineries, both. Raw data, like crude oil, isn't very useful. Classified datasets, OTOH, are what everyone will run on. Not many companies are classifying at scale.

2057 2018-05-24 20:01:30 The asphalt used in your parking lot is a product of crude oil, but that doesn't mean it's bad for the environment. Crude oil goes through fractal distillation to create various products like gasoline and jet fuel. Asphalt is a byproduct that would otherwise go to landfills.

2064 2018-05-24 20:00:46 The oil, gas and mining companies are welcome to send money to Scott Pruitt and call it a tax write-off or free enterprise.  Nobody will mind. The public will remain passive to outright bribery and corruption.  This is our new normal.
2065 2018-05-24 20:00:41 These might sound goofy, but in case you haven't tried them, my wife has used peppermint oil to alleviate migraine pain, Sudafed even though she's not congested she swears it relieves the tension, pressure points, and putting on a sleep mask while cutting off sound and sleeping.
2066 2018-05-24 20:00:38 lemon oil from the fresh rind of the fruit. used by the Romans for stomach upsets & for bad breath! in Aromatherapy it's used to clear the head if you have a cold or are mentally exhausted, for energising an aching body, boosting circulation & warming hands & feet! #essentialoils

2070 2018-05-24 20:00:18 Volkswagen is killing me with these  nearly $100 oil changes
2071 2018-05-24 20:00:17 Pretty good chance that there will be no more as the influence of religion is waning in most parts of  the world but then you can always count on the weak and superstitious to look for something "supernatural" to guide them and the snake oil sales people to provide it.
2072 2018-05-24 20:00:06 Nah they’re trippin girl, even better when you cook the rice with alittle bit of coconut oil
2073 2018-05-24 20:00:04 Check out these pop-up banners we created for Eastern Propane & Oil!
2074 2018-05-24 20:00:03 Christie by the oil I said no because I don t get rid of those guys will check them so suddenly.
2075 2018-05-24 20:00:00 I am sooo intrigued ! My nyx gel liner is the reason I had to get an oil remover because the stuff doesn’t come off but if this takes off waterproof makeup easily and may be less messy I may check it out #RenewVoxBox #Contest
2076 2018-05-24 20:00:00 Would CBD oil help me? I only get about 4 hours of sleep a night -.-
2077 2018-05-24 19:59:46 VZ Pres Maduro: VZ should ask assistance from China, Russia, OPEC & Arab nations to revive its oil industry if necessary.

 VZ must boost oil output by 1M bpd this year.

  US sanctions cause great difficulties but VZ will overcome them.

2079 2018-05-24 19:59:43 Why do I get this feeling that sanctions by USA against Iran (oil prices going up for India), but supported by Russia is a timed one and are a pre-planned strategy with union elections in India coming up in 2019? #Modi @republic @narendramodi @AmitShahOffice @AmitShah @TimesNow
2080 2018-05-24 19:59:41 Try ‘grease lightning’ by lush. it’s an aloe and tea tree oil gel. i use it after every wash on my problem areas and it has helped me clear up and even out my skin.
2081 2018-05-24 19:59:28 It's turmeric with coconut milk and/or coconut oil.

... it's... reprehensible, at best.
2082 2018-05-24 19:59:26 Have just watched a segment on #channel4news about medicinal cannabis. I cannot believe that the UK is the world's largest manufacturer of medicinal cannabis??!?!  So the gov are raking in what must be millions in taxes yet cannabis oil is illegal here?
2083 2018-05-24 19:59:16 I suggested in 2014 we have a phasing out period & during that period the UK pays what we need for an excellent, fully funded NHS & education system. I suppose we could add renewables & innovation projects. Seems fair for the wastage of oil & years of present danger!
2084 2018-05-24 19:59:09 HOw is it that my face is a greasy oil slick and the rest of my body is so dry I'm getting paper cuts and scratches from anything I touch?
2085 2018-05-24 19:59:02 Please do not bring her back she has passed in a God speeeeeeeed
2086 2018-05-24 19:58:55 Reno knows the truth, he is benefiting financially from the looting of the treasure. Why trying to create religion tension? Is that the way to defend, allegation of corruption, levelled against a government, that was in power, for sixteen years, with revenue from oil above $500b?
2087 2018-05-24 19:58:55 Yane
2088 2018-05-24 19:58:55 Bring OIL prices down , otherwise forget 2019. I am BJP supporter but I am frustrated with this.

2090 2018-05-24 19:58:36 But dude!  How about that #NFLAnthem shit?  So much winning. #maga Oil Prices are up, and u got that #ZTE going as well.  No way does #Obama hold a candle to u as #POTUS
2091 2018-05-24 19:58:34 So let's get this right,even with oil money and self taxing,border control...if they get in the EU Scotland could not self finance.
They cannot stick to their budget now and asked for a bail out...I mean more money.
2092 2018-05-24 19:58:30 So trump is wanting to deal with oil pipes in the ocean sadly that puts marine life in danger
2093 2018-05-24 19:58:21 Who is this guy?
2094 2018-05-24 19:58:16 Had my thrill 4 the day. Went to Walmart to pickup a gal of Rotella T6 for oil change on the steelhorse. Saw a police officer on top of a woman attempting to handcuff her near the front of the store. She was kicking and screaming. When I came out 6 police cars were on the scene.
2095 2018-05-24 19:58:13 Does it feel greasy? I use an oil based eye makeup remover and it gets the job done but it does feel yucky to be honest #RenewVoxbox #Contest
2096 2018-05-24 19:58:12 It's been 11 years and I'm still pissed out whenever I think of it.

This is the guy who also cooked chilis in oil on high heat and basically pepper sprayed us all with the fumes.

2098 2018-05-24 19:57:45 Would sell my soul for oil paint... but I don't have one.
2099 2018-05-24 19:57:43 If you want a sustainable system, there is no other way out of it. The reason we can feed 7 billion people is 100% reliant on oil. There is currently nothing that can replace that. And when we run out of the rare earth metals alot of our tech will no longer be producable.
2100 2018-05-24 19:57:39 peppermint oil for my headache 
2101 2018-05-24 19:57:30 TOTALLY I wondered if ppl realized this abt Putin’s oil. Obama squeezed Putin out of the market by lowering price of oil. This is collusion
2102 2018-05-24 19:57:28 Tired of getting my oil changed & niggas coming out telling me I need something done like give me my damn car keys lmao

2106 2018-05-24 19:56:50 everyone here is fucking cancer
trump has done buttfuck nothing except for tax cuts in an entire year, the economic growth is due to the usd's dependence on oil, which donald has been happy to use recklessly. Everyone else, you're just as brainwashed as him.
2107 2018-05-24 19:56:33 White people really did dry shampoo. It took all the oil out of my hair and refreshed it a bit. I stan.
2108 2018-05-24 19:56:29 Yeah but then oil money dey. 
2109 2018-05-24 19:56:23 I had insomnia like a mother fucker and CBD oil worked perfect. That stuff is a god sent.
2110 2018-05-24 19:56:09 Came here for an oil change...spending close to 300$ on a non pay week.

Adulting is so much fun.

2113 2018-05-24 19:55:59 Themes fr today's FFTT: 

1.  "US is trying to weaponize the USD & oil v. Russia & Iran, while Russia & Iran are trying to use oil to weaponize gold v. the USD."

2.  "The US is now doing everything Pres. Obama said it should not do if it wants to keep the USD’s reserve status."
2114 2018-05-24 19:55:16 @MikePompeo4USA What are they waiting for? The dictator won again. I prefer that you use the oil of the country you.
2115 2018-05-24 19:55:12 هنالك طرق اخرى تردع هذا الفعل بإستثناء التشهيير والشخص الواعي لن يتجرأ للتحرش التشهيير هو طريقه تسيء بها للشخص واهله ومن حوله ليست للشخص نفسه بعض الاهالي لا ذنب لهم اتمنى توصل الفكره.
2116 2018-05-24 19:54:56 Othervway round you muppet, it’s your £ that’ll be worthless once it’s no longer pegged to oil.
2117 2018-05-24 19:54:47 Huh? Offcourse it produces results. But our food production is 100% dependent on oil. And it is a finite reosource. Alot of our tech is based on rare earth metals. If you want a sustainable system you need to get rid of most of earths population.
2118 2018-05-24 19:54:45 Maybe you could try mixing some sodium bicarbonate and oil (seed oil, olive oil, whatever) and applying it with a teethbrush. I use it to remove glue from glass containers.
2119 2018-05-24 19:54:41 I’m not the biggest fan of it but I want to use it up before I try something new. It does help my foundation go on smoothly but does nothing for oil control which I don’t like
2120 2018-05-24 19:54:40 That is oil covered BS!
2121 2018-05-24 19:54:36 My fave... when you’re making a bombass breakfast but the hot oil pops up and burns your face.  I wasn’t working with much to begin with and now I got a polka dotted face... thanks life!  You da realist. *pewpew*
2122 2018-05-24 19:54:32 I really wish I had the money to get fresh groceries and try new recipes like once a week. I wanna make chicken parm and creamy tomato pasta and tortellini soup and fresh lemon and olive oil salads and
2123 2018-05-24 19:54:12 Same question bro are you Tall? 
2124 2018-05-24 19:54:03 Thankfully it was acrylic paint - might have been a different story if she used oil! 
2125 2018-05-24 19:53:51 but I still like to think that there are some dinosaurs that got mixed up in the layers of organic material and ultimately turned to oil.
2126 2018-05-24 19:53:42 The way they cheer when it’s lowered into the oil gives me life

2129 2018-05-24 19:53:29 Americans afraid of $3 gas?  That energy independent country slapped a $1 gas tax (for general funds, not for roads) in 1st oil crisis (you remember, '73) now near $5 a gallon--you know, Canada.  (+provincial gas taxes).  Americans love their gas subsidy!  #btv #vtpoli #vtfoto
2130 2018-05-24 19:53:27 I honestly find it funny and weird that a lot of these company men in the oil field think I’m white 
2131 2018-05-24 19:53:25 I'm sure we could rally support for that.
2132 2018-05-24 19:53:24 What utter bollocks. I’ve been to Hull plenty of times to watch RL and it ain’t no oil painting. Coventry is a great city and I’m proud to say my home.
2133 2018-05-24 19:53:22 what kind of oil ?
2134 2018-05-24 19:53:15 nahhhhh it's all good, at least we're both going to keep hearing oil change ajsdkgjd

2137 2018-05-24 19:53:01 It's awesome, give it a whirl. I'm sure the lavender soap with peppermint oil will work the same way if you already have the lavender soap :)

2141 2018-05-24 19:52:30 To prevent pollution at home:
Purchase products with minimal packaging
•Limit fertilizers and pesticides, especially near lakes and streams
•Recycle plastics, glass, newspaper, used motor oil, transmission fluid and brake fluid
2142 2018-05-24 19:52:22 I use garlic ear oil for my kids if they have a sore ear. Works like a charm!

2144 2018-05-24 19:52:16 The Angering other countries, that is heat in the kitchen. Of course they do not like evening up the trade. We have had bad leadership in trade for decades. Rs and Ds. Re oil prices - that is a commodity and was artificially low as Saudi’s knocked our production down on purpose
2145 2018-05-24 19:51:59 And, as you stated, a startup is not going to have the capital to carry out a vertical integration. One producing oil well doesn't earn enough to buy a shipping fleet.
2146 2018-05-24 19:51:48 Doug's base see this and goes THE NDP HAS FEMALE OIL RASSLIN'? Damn I'm in the wrong party

2149 2018-05-24 19:51:15 so we planned that the oil splashed on me while i was holding the kettle *we had to fill it with water* and then it fell on d glass and it broke.. phew. That was hard tho

2162 2018-05-24 19:49:22 Buy you some peppermint oil lady!!! I put it on my temples, neck, and wrist when I have a migraine. Also take a bath in a few drops! I always submerge my head under the water for a few minutes before I get out then try and lay down!

2170 2018-05-24 19:48:30 Great...let's be the first to drill for oil there and spoil it (snark)
2171 2018-05-24 19:48:28 So more and more I have got the impression, that you are really menatlly ill. You threaten Kim Jong Un with a lot of insulting tweets, promise fire and fury and watch other countries to put oil on troubled waters. Now, that NK has obviously destroyed their nuclear test area......
2172 2018-05-24 19:48:21 Who is going to pay for the oil that con party brought on loans? Do u even know the amount of loans that were piled up by con party? Ask ur dad why he kept quiet in Parliament when con party was taking loans left and right?

2177 2018-05-24 19:48:07 The secret for your pasta not to stick is stirring it frequently, Ive never used oil nor did I have sticky pasta through out my cooking history (1.5 years that is)

2181 2018-05-24 19:47:53 Lmfao I’m so clueless when it comes to cars I’m at the place just for an oil change and they got me sounding like an idiot
2182 2018-05-24 19:47:52 Yesss  it’s the only one that works best for me and the blonde. The olive oil one makes my hair look green  and the white one is just too crusty for me
2183 2018-05-24 19:47:46 Pipelines.  I own ranch next to Dakota access pipeline and that whole protest was a joke. Indians wanted it. Protesters were all from out of state and paid by soros and buffet.  Oil flowing now
2184 2018-05-24 19:47:39 Mostly artificial ones, but sometimes tea tree oil can bother me, and the smell of boiling eggs always gives me a headache.
2185 2018-05-24 19:47:39 OK I finally broke down and looked it up. After the weeping ceased, I have realized this is what Getty Oil did when they purchased a tanker fleet to carry their oil. Instead of paying somebody else to carry their product, they bought assets to do it in-house.
2186 2018-05-24 19:47:37 Massages with oil never end just like that  I promise
2187 2018-05-24 19:47:35 The wild and ruin the ecosystem. He allowed a private sector to build that pipeline at standing Rock, knowing full well that it would leak and ruin water supply. He is very obviously racist, so much so that he promotes it. He's allowing off shore drilling AKA oil spills. He's
2188 2018-05-24 19:47:35 today I got an oil change without getting out of my car. This is the future.
2189 2018-05-24 19:47:30 Venezuela's newly re-elected President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday pledged to release some jailed opposition activists, boost the OPEC member's tanking oil production and open dialogue with business leaders.
2190 2018-05-24 19:47:25 Even in peace time there was no productivity. Growth is mostly a factor of oil production and oil revenue consumption.
2191 2018-05-24 19:47:22 When there is no money flowing the last you do is quadruple debt. I know socialists can't manage money, but this is economics 101. The oil money went to scavengers in ONTARIO and QUEERBEC in the form on transfer payments to the tune of 50 billion dollars!
2192 2018-05-24 19:47:21 come one, come all. Get your snake oil here before it's gone!
2193 2018-05-24 19:47:20 I did a 5 day juice cleanse and then I've been laying off the processed foods since then. Added MCT oil to my diet in the morning. Changed up a few things with my intake. I feel a lot better. Not to mention down 8lbs since 5/13. All with no exercise, but I do want pizza!
2194 2018-05-24 19:47:12 Early dinner tonight. N.Y. Sirloin, Mac and cheese (good cheddar and elbows) grilled radicchio and bok choy (marinated in olive oil, espelette, and fish sauce). No dessert. (Big eating weekend)
2195 2018-05-24 19:47:12 Baby powder forms a barrier that keeps oil and grime from seeping into the threads, so sprinkle on clothes, esp underarms
2196 2018-05-24 19:47:03 It's my faaavorite! Like...my hair loves it. It is a miraculous oil

2197 2018-05-24 19:46:52 I need to go oil my hair smh
2198 2018-05-24 19:46:39 And we were doing both under #Obama 's leadership!  

Solar and wind the future, not coal and oil. 
Upcycling rather than a disposable economy.

2208 2018-05-24 19:45:50 the United States, with less than 5 percent of the global population, uses about a  quarter of the world’s fossil fuel resources, burning nearly 25        percent of the coal, 26 percent of the oil, and 27 percent of the world’s natural gas.
2209 2018-05-24 19:45:45 Arugula with fresh herbs and walnut oil for supper - kind of got addicted to it :)
2210 2018-05-24 19:45:42 Then you haven’t read the figures or listened to our own first minister. Think about it. If this was true why has Nicola never said it? Look into how much our oil costs to extract than these Arab countries. These are completely different countries to us.

2212 2018-05-24 19:45:18 Ur that kind of people who don't know about how fuel cost is decided. In year 2004 and in year 2018 price of crude oil is all most same so price of fuel is still 80 huh u are that kind of  people who borrow other's cycle to go the market lol and  modi ji is global facku icon
2213 2018-05-24 19:45:13 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2214 2018-05-24 19:45:07 1.)Stay away from methods that cause unecessary breakage
2.) Water is your best friend!! Seal that in with a good oil. I sometimes add a leave in conditioner.
3.) I wash & deep condition my hair every 2nd week.
4.)Feel like this varies with hair type

2216 2018-05-24 19:44:47 We also go to war for political bump & to show off our advanced military technology, which sells more on both sides of every potential conflict thus our war industry is "needed".

Iraq war (2003) wasn't about getting oil, Cheney admitted in 1994 the invasion would be a quagmire.
2217 2018-05-24 19:44:45 I would like to see how these countries would do if we didn't use fossil fuel.  These nordice countries own oil companies and drill offshore!  They also do not have to support illegals from neighboring countries.
2218 2018-05-24 19:44:41 Thanks for the info. According to your own info, 63% of your products come from non-deforestation. Which means 27% (and for palm oil it’s over 40%) comes from deforestation... so when it becomes 0% in 2020, will Nestle rebuild the rainforest it’s currently destroying?

2224 2018-05-24 19:43:48 Not only that, the materials in a Tesla, as in most cars require plastic which is created from... oil. Fabricating requires oil. Paint requires oil. Electric charging stations require oil. In short, manufacturing requires oil. Not to mention your house, phone, clothes..
2225 2018-05-24 19:43:43 Ontario is broke. The Liberals are killing Alberta oil which is less transfer payments, the worst thing  Ontario could do right now is vote in the communist party, oh sorry, the NDP. Canada is watching Ontario, don’t F##K this up, @fordnation is only choice.
2226 2018-05-24 19:43:40 Why are you always in MY business? I’m sorry i don’t want advice from some one who is constantly downing me. MY NURSE told me the oil was fine. So stop calling me names and get out of my mentions if you can’t take my “thank you” and move tf on
2227 2018-05-24 19:43:31 Hi Jenn...what smoked olive oil are you using these days at the restaurant or home? I have not found one that I’ve liked or has been fairly priced. Thoughts?
2228 2018-05-24 19:43:29 Why are we complaining - because we know that the current govt has levied the highest rate of indirect taxes on fuel which is ensuring that even though the crude oil prices are lower than 2013-14 levels, we are still paying at the rates that were being charged then.
2229 2018-05-24 19:43:23 Looks like Big Oil and their leader, Pruitt, won this round...  But Big Corn (or in reality the many, many, many small corn farmers) isn't giving up!
2230 2018-05-24 19:43:19 Getting my car detailed and the oil changed this weekend 
2231 2018-05-24 19:43:17 Spent a while doing repairs and services on infield oil hauling trucks. Things had to drive down aqful dirt/gravel roads all day everybday. A fix working and lasting as long as possibke was more important than how pretty it looked.

That mentality stuck, for better or worse.
2232 2018-05-24 19:43:13 @PMOIndia Dear PM,
I was used to be your Fan but you broke trust of us.
You a master stroke in every field, can change the law in a night but why don't you bring 3 major sectors- Petroleum oil, alcohol Drinks & Real Estate in GST, despite having govt in 90% states

2234 2018-05-24 19:42:22 Can I replace the spray oil when frying with this coconut blend spread? #voxbox #contest #pureblendsxinfluenster
2235 2018-05-24 19:42:21 @jamieoliver I really wish you would stop saying ‘just a dash of Olive Oil’, because what you really mean is half a Bottle.
2236 2018-05-24 19:42:18 Not sure if I have discovered this later than everyone else but sugar and baby oil mixed together is THE BEST for exfoliating

2239 2018-05-24 19:42:13 Wow! I've seen academics who are dumb in their own field but this "Prof." of applied economics is one in a kind in his lack of knowledge in macroeconomics let alone interactional trade. Clue: Iran's main source of revenue is oil and as of now there hasn't been reduction in export
2240 2018-05-24 19:42:11 Heck, you burn a lamp with petroleum oil, you're burning them, a la Jebus.

2246 2018-05-24 19:41:43 My dad could pull that off too. Could put oil is his car without getting anything on his white suit.

Unfortunately, this super power is not genetically transferred.
2247 2018-05-24 19:41:41 You know I've never seen a top chef spray a steak in oil before cooking Scott ... I wonder how @Nigella_Lawson does hers?

2264 2018-05-24 19:40:13 With the rise in crude oil price since 2017, I wonder why the dire economic situation still persist to date.
The international community can help both the Venezuela & Venezuelans by lifting the economic embargo for business & job creation, while also providing funds 4 SMEs.

2268 2018-05-24 19:39:53 Easy - stop taking oil out of the ground.  Strange that I can say that, and you cannot.
2269 2018-05-24 19:39:53 I was asked about a job using linseed oil before, never used it and to be fair don’t know enough about using it to take the job, Any tips or specific info for it you can recommend?
2270 2018-05-24 19:39:52 É curioso pq os morgans puxaram o papel praticamente sozinhos pra 26 reais. E agora vão devolver tudo na cabeça dos incautos. O mercado é bipolar sem dúvidas.

2271 2018-05-24 19:39:42 Not likely if you know anything about the oil industry.
2272 2018-05-24 19:39:38 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. Thanks - Mark 3/3

2279 2018-05-24 19:38:31 If i didn’t ask for your advice then please don’t give it... my mother has had three kids and castor oil didn’t kill any of us.

2281 2018-05-24 19:38:12 Newly re-elected Venezuelan President Nicolas #Maduro said on Thursday that blaming him for Venezuela's economic meltdown was a "stupid simplification," but pledged to boost oil production and open dialogue with business leaders.
2282 2018-05-24 19:38:00 Data is oil 
2283 2018-05-24 19:37:52 You want them to focus only on really important things like the 329 thousand workers in mining, oil and gas, forestry and fishing, (Yes, ALL those industries together employ under 1/10th of the population)

Not unimportant things,
Like 18.6 million women, AKA Half the population.

It's not govts fault, it's just failed opposition.

2321 2018-05-24 19:34:14 Because the message is that the product is spying on people (which is already inaccurate), and it is purposefully hiding from the readers the specifics of the issue. Therefore they won't be able to tell real solutions from snake oil.

2326 2018-05-24 19:33:31 #ShaunToner #JocelynFetter @ItweetMatrix had a project to delineate the residual oil from a spill in the sediment downstream; Did so by looking at natural currents, sediment transport, using remote sensing, field studies #naturalchannels

2328 2018-05-24 19:33:16 (if you couldn't tell, I've procrastinated my art homework to the LITERAL last minute because the class ends tomorrow and I wasn't even halfway done with my oil pastel homework)
2329 2018-05-24 19:33:10 I’m an every day migraines sufferer and things that help are: peppermint essential oil, pressure points (google the one between your thumb and index), water, and sometimes caffeine (although this can create adverse effects aka worse migraines so be careful)
2330 2018-05-24 19:33:05 Our country is criss crossed with pipelines carrying all kinds of stuff. It's safer, cheaper & less carbon intensive then rail. Also when rails are full of oil they can't ship our grain/pulses for farmers.
2331 2018-05-24 19:33:04 I took my car to get a oil change. And he did my washer fluid, power steering and all that. Just for 28 ... perks of being cute 
2332 2018-05-24 19:33:00 Lovely group meal last night @BrunswickHse Comfortable service. Now musing on DIY burrata with pistachio and green olive oil.
2333 2018-05-24 19:33:00 Money was Always with the compainies which they can now pay back to Iran in 3 installments. Thats why it has no and should have no effect on rise in oil prises at all.
2334 2018-05-24 19:32:44 No, thank you, Ed. The world of weather is full of snake oil salesmen. The people need to know they can count on you to keep it 
2335 2018-05-24 19:32:29 i also have a tendancy to break oil pastels when I'm using them and it's super frustrating bc it hurts to hold the tiny little nub of oil pastel as im drawing
2336 2018-05-24 19:32:05 Turkeys threats are about oil pipeline routes in the Aegean and Cyprus . Israel is involved the USA have interests and Germany wants there money back . We are not imbeciles . We are smart . Who's Macedonia ? We will tell you who you ARE . Imbecile . Our decision .

2338 2018-05-24 19:31:54 First this is Oil Companies due which they will pay with the help of Government over the period of time in 3 installments. First was made in 2016 I think. Total due was about 43000 crores. The payment channels were opened in 2015 or 2016. (1/2)
2339 2018-05-24 19:31:54 when's the last time you think they changed the oil in the fryer? THAT'S WHERE THE FLAVOR IS
2340 2018-05-24 19:31:53 I'm curious as to your thoughts about

2343 2018-05-24 19:31:40 i love working with oil pastels, but I have to stop and wash my hands every time I switch colors because otherwise I get SUPER MESSY.

2349 2018-05-24 19:30:54 Who is a silly boy? Oil revenues have greatly decreased, perhaps you had not noticed.  To have an independent currency Scotland would require £300 billion and oil revenue is now in millions not billions. It does not take a mathematician to see that the sums do not add up.

2354 2018-05-24 19:29:53 O/N Wrap:
Equities lose ground following confirmation that the meeting between North Korea and USA has been binned; talk of US imposing additional tariffs on vehicle imports also weighs; oil slightly lower; NZD ignores turmoil, holding above 0.6900.
2355 2018-05-24 19:29:42 If I was an oil baron and worried about the future of my business, I think I'd be looking to become a solar baron. Instead of pestering politicians to keep my business alive, I'd think of myself as an "energy" baron, where oil is just one form of energy with a limited shelf life.

2360 2018-05-24 19:29:26 How are you arriving at 400m? Based on standardized measure numbers comparing LGCY(comparable oil/gas MLP) to EVEPQ, if you take total liabilities + Market cap (essentially enterprise value), EVEPQ would have to rise to over 500m in market cap.

2363 2018-05-24 19:29:19 Saudi and Russia now 'conspiring' to bring the oil price down again - that'll fix the frackers in the USA.
2364 2018-05-24 19:29:17 Kurds were bought with oil proceeds.   Money over God, over country, over family.  Money is the god of this crooked world.
2365 2018-05-24 19:28:58 Been meaning to pick one of these up & taste with the 12/16/18 & Old/Raspy Engine Oil & Engineers Reserve. Worth seeking this #beer out?
2366 2018-05-24 19:28:57 After your party grab more GAS TAX you want oil companies to cut the Price. WOW you should stop with grabbing gas taxes just because the prices were reasonable. @NancyPelosi told you to take advantage of the low gas price & TAX & SPEND IT.

TRANSPORTE DEFICIENTE.

2377 2018-05-24 19:27:50 There is no bear case until recession comes, which is not now. They claim "peak earnings" as bearish but it doesn't sound like it to me. Shorting oil is another story.
2378 2018-05-24 19:27:44 The money illegals send home is Mexico's second largest source of foreign cash. Just under oil sales. More illegals here, more money flowing to Mexico. Cut off their money pipe, see how quickly they respond.
2379 2018-05-24 19:27:42 @Timcast Just a heads-up, YouTube is banning several channels advertising CBD oil. #FYI

2382 2018-05-24 19:27:36 So sorry for the delay in response - it is a very thick sauce! It's oil based so sometimes in the fridge it can solidify. Take it out of the fridge and give it a few very good shakes to loosen it up!
2383 2018-05-24 19:27:35 I personally smoke because it's cheaper, easier to get hold of & I enjoy smoking it. It definitely helps treat symptoms of IBD, no question. But high strength CBD oil is expensive, so not a long term solution. It should be available on NHS, some incredible stories out there.

2388 2018-05-24 19:27:23 @skymule20 sent me a thing saying peppermint oil + water in a spray bottle works as bug repellent and it DOES! it also gives a nice cooling sensation (some ppl hate it but I love it) but it actually works. this is a big deal for me bc FUCK BUGS

2391 2018-05-24 19:26:54 It is only Trump & Saudi joint operation. Else Obama had brought OPEC to knees by liberating shell oil companies.
2392 2018-05-24 19:26:52 Try CBD oil...works wonders...but suppose each individual is different
2393 2018-05-24 19:26:46 Neither is good. Gas prices are way over inflated. Oil went up gas went up. Oil went down Gas stayed up. Now oil is creeping back up and we are paying much the same price when oil  was 140 per barrel How that happen ?
2394 2018-05-24 19:26:35 before posting this , you shud knw the fact well.Crude oil now a days are cheaper than ever there in middle east per barrel and also its supply while at the time of congress regime , per barrel cost was high .So they would definitely sell at higher rate .#Bhakt
2395 2018-05-24 19:26:33 I cosponsored  HR 1784 the Stop Arctic Ocean Drilling Act. This will prohibit new leases & renewals for oil & gas exploration in the Arctic Ocean. It is long past time we take the human impact on our climate seriously.
2396 2018-05-24 19:26:18 In 2015 there are 21 crore registered vehicles in India whearas compared to 63 lacs in Sri Lanka and 1.7 crore in Pakistan 
 Russia is the largest and USA is Third largest oil producing nation of the world and India is 24th 
How u can compare the oil rates of all theese nations
2397 2018-05-24 19:26:11 Yeah, sure.  Where's that oil money?
2398 2018-05-24 19:25:59 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

2401 2018-05-24 19:25:28 The servile governments in Alberta over the past 40+ years have done nothing but give it all away, and now the province has nothing to show for it but abandoned oil wells the public is on the hook for. Boardrooms in Texas have been laughing at their idiocy the whole time.

2403 2018-05-24 19:25:00 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2404 2018-05-24 19:24:57 $50 is more accurate.  I feel my money trickling back to Big Oil.
2405 2018-05-24 19:24:25 I think you are dealing with one person switching between accounts.
2406 2018-05-24 19:24:20 An oil pipeline is making something worse? Color me shocked!
2407 2018-05-24 19:24:17 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.

KJV. Exodus 29:40
2408 2018-05-24 19:24:13 “Contribute and support 250 000 jobs”. 

She referring to the effect the pipe will have on the oil industry not just the pipeline project. The jobs come from expanded capacity. The 15000 is just for the construction. Try and comprehend before your vehement ramblings.
2409 2018-05-24 19:24:13 I was in need of an oil change and I refused to do on my spare time  so why not get it done while you’re at work 
2410 2018-05-24 19:24:06 Apparently showing up for an express oil change without an appointment is pretty unheard of in Orange County. They’re gonna be horrified by me in general. #breakingboundaries
2411 2018-05-24 19:24:03 They left because they weren’t willing to help us win trophies. They were selfish, simple as that. And no football club spends money they don’t actually have, whether that comes from player sales or commercial revenue. Unless you’re an inhumane oil monopoly

2415 2018-05-24 19:23:25 If it feels better when you pull on your ear it's probably an ear infection. If it feels worse, it's probably swimmers ear. Like 15 years ago I had swimmers ear & putting warm olive oil in my ear helped a ton.

2418 2018-05-24 19:23:13 The storyline is similar for all the poor Oil-rich nations. The poverty pendulum gyrates between visionless leadership, a disoriented populace and extraneous hegemony. Oil seems to be a curse in disguise.

2437 2018-05-24 19:21:13 Next they’ll be saying our resources, tech capability, inventiveness are much better than those countries but why use logic to prove Scotland will do well when we can talk about GERs that doesn’t show what an independent Scotland would look like. Like oil, it’s a bloody nuisance!
2438 2018-05-24 19:21:05 I talked friends into pulling million+ out of Market last week.

Little chance of further 10% gain

Risk of oil price shock (since 1973 all oil price shocks > recessions)

Risk of trade wars

Risks of war/conflict w/ Iran & N Korea

Mueller risk

Incompetence risk w/Trump Admin.

2454 2018-05-24 19:19:54 What recipes are you using that only require water? Unless your new faucet also delivers milk, oil, etc.? Does it also handle dry ingredients like flour and sugar? I think I'll hang onto my measuring cups.
2455 2018-05-24 19:19:52 I'm English but that to me seemed like the biggest travesty of #IndyRef that they waited until a week after the vote to 'discover' massive untapped oil reserves off the Scottish coast to plunder and export to the rest of the UK.

2459 2018-05-24 19:19:04 I’m definitely not a trump guy but as a financial professional the executive branch has a small impact on the prices of oil.

2465 2018-05-24 19:18:16 Ok since republicans blamed Obama for everything, i say the rising gas prices and school shootings are Trumps fault. Maybe Trumps instability as a president could cause market fluctuations on crude oil and his unwillingness to propose better laws to prevent school shootings 
2466 2018-05-24 19:18:09 You're correct on that! My apologies to @alicecooper
2467 2018-05-24 19:18:06 I used to have the Vivaro. Bought it brand new in 06, biggest piece of shit I’ve ever had. So many faults!
I reckon in the 5 years I had it, it must have cost nearly £5k in repairs.

2476 2018-05-24 19:17:13 What was crude oil price at that time?

Crude oil price was 33 in 2003 And it got increased to 125 in 2012. Hence such a huge difference in fuel prices.

In januray 2015, crude oil price has fallen to 57 and no benefit was given to common man.

So who is looting the nation?
2477 2018-05-24 19:17:10 Oil is traded on a 30 day contract on the Chicago Merchantile . Dumb , Dumbs believe the prez sets the price.
2478 2018-05-24 19:17:01 Until very recently Syria’s oil was being smuggled into Turkey and sold to Erdogan on the black market for cash so...there’s that...I suppose selling on the market and pricing with Euros would make sense as most their crude is processed in the region

2488 2018-05-24 19:16:13 In 1935, Italy attacked Abyssinia, hoping to expand. The League voted to stop trade sanctions to Italy, but didn't make much of a difference since Italy’s biggest import, oil, wasn’t included. The League was still hoping for Italy’s support if there was a war with Germany. YIKES!

2498 2018-05-24 19:15:21 If the gas and oil companies weren’t bleeding the public dry then they wouldn’t have resorted to returning to wood burning.  I also love my fire pit in the garden.....they can’t ban everything!

2509 2018-05-24 19:14:07 What makes you think they weren’t looting it? Where is the wealth from before socialism? Or has Venezuela only been selling oil for the last 19 ears?
2510 2018-05-24 19:14:03 Oh ok just fyi City won a European cup in 1970 long before the oil money you're jealous of.

2527 2018-05-24 19:12:50 I would make sure you start with at least 50mg ideally 100+, if its oil/drops be prepared for it to taste vile, the stuff you add to water or even the gummys are much easier to deal with. good luck gecky, i really hope it works for you <3

2533 2018-05-24 19:11:54 Hahahaha!!! LYING. Just like YOUR Dear Leader.
2534 2018-05-24 19:11:54 While we're making changes to F1 for 2019, can we mandate that all oil outlets need to be at the main exhaust outlet, and they have an electrical ignitor there permanently.
So instead of spits of oil being flicked onto the driver behind, we have spits of fire! 
2535 2018-05-24 19:11:45 It is funny that you just think about the generation of cars and trucks but have you thought that oil and gas also is your computer, your solar panel your toothbrush the clothes on your back. Once you have stopped using oil and gas products let me know how we are a dying industry
2536 2018-05-24 19:11:44 Honestly, the government should pass a law that makes it easier to impeach our leaders. For example, if a leader were to say, increase gas prices, even though the price per barrel of oil justifies a $0.95 / L, they should be kicked out of office. If the leader increases

2541 2018-05-24 19:11:31 It’s all fun and games until you spill water in a pan of boiling oil :)
2542 2018-05-24 19:11:27 Oil is also tied to 'petro dollar' and fiat currency.
2543 2018-05-24 19:11:01 @ReneeStephen, solar and wind are only going to get us so far, I view oil as the only viable fuel for heavy truck/equipment and aircraft so why not get the biggest tax value for petroleum we can until the market for it ends
2544 2018-05-24 19:10:52 Y'all, I'm so worried about the kittens in the get cat colony next door. There were 3 or 4, but all except the black one seem to have disappeared. I'm worried the oil guy had been abandoned or something happened to the white litter mates with grey spots.

2547 2018-05-24 19:10:40 Are you talking about our former president or the oil? Either way you’re changing the topic so you’ve got no argument 
2548 2018-05-24 19:10:36 BTW want to know why the Republicans have never had to renounce them. We never supported them. That is a fallacy made up by the Left and their hatred.

2565 2018-05-24 19:08:20 It isn't and never was. Oil is a short term lubricant - did you know Scotland is into renewables? Unlike some middle eastern countries we have diverse revenue streams that will form the building blocks of our economy.
2566 2018-05-24 19:08:20 And don't  forget the fuel prices.  We supposedly have enough oil and gas that we can all live well.  BUT wall street speculators are stealing our wealth.  # stop the crime.

2575 2018-05-24 19:07:39 Agree but a word of cation regarding shorting $USO, which buys futures and the crude curve is in backwardation.  Wont necessary act like spot oil and negative roll yield (for a short) if it stays that way.  The reverse is true for a long, of course.

2594 2018-05-24 19:06:21 Yeah. And, renounced by them decades ago. Now its preferred party is the Trumpster GOP. Move along, nitwit.
2595 2018-05-24 19:06:06 I see these things saying “add a few drops of water to your pan to see if it’s hot enough” and I’m like wtf I’m not putting water in hot oil.
2596 2018-05-24 19:06:04 Guess these fools have kinda forgotten about those critters called dinosaurs that used to roam the Earth.  Pretty sure humans had nothing whatsoever to do with their extinction.

2600 2018-05-24 19:05:52 His statements are dumb. But is there really zero corrosive impact of oil/gas/auto advertising & sponsorship $$? The number of API, clean coal, pro-fracking, etc. ads (event sponsorships, etc.) I’ve seen on major political news sites is substantial.

2604 2018-05-24 19:05:29 Cannabis derivatives that are non-psychotropic, such as CBD oil & tinctures, lotions etc it's the THC that is illegal. Personally, I think all cannabis should be legal, as THC cannabis also has medicinal properties.
2605 2018-05-24 19:05:28 @POTUS I don't know about the rest of the country if the oil refineries gave out bonuses because of the tax incentive plan President Trump did if they did they're trying to recover the loss gas prices are up to $2.99 for regular per gallon in the Cincinnati area

2613 2018-05-24 19:04:27 You know Vince Russo drove two million of those away right?  in the middle of a boom period? Killed the ratings and buyrates?  

Plus, wrestling fans aren't oil, there's new ones every day.  Fans move on, in every avenue of entertainment.  So what?
2614 2018-05-24 19:04:08 Or indeed how do similar sized countries like Denmark and Ireland have a much greater GDP than us when they don't even have any oil or gas at all.
2615 2018-05-24 19:03:52 /CL   the US should not be exporting  US oil to China - i don't give a shit what excuses they give

2631 2018-05-24 19:02:01 apparently they made movie popcorn 'butter' with coconut oil, and really butter couldn't match the texture. "So, should I do the channel surfing or you?"

2635 2018-05-24 19:01:40 I do actually have beard oil (lol) for when I let it grow but I usually keep it pretty short tbh
2636 2018-05-24 19:01:35 Don't eat half a pound of coconut oil in one go. 

I didn't get digestive issues at all, but felt very weird / wired for a day. Excessive / unexpected ketone onslaught? Has never happened with normal food.
2637 2018-05-24 19:01:24 Why must I have to pay $80 for an oil change

2649 2018-05-24 19:00:34 Sometimes I forget the Canadian government is similarly fueled and funded by big industry special interests. 
Mr. Trudeau is correct to not trust American DEALS. Canada needs to sell less oil and stockpile it for their future security.
Much like the USA with our shale oil boom.
2650 2018-05-24 19:00:31 I’m that bored I have just found myself creating slow motion videos of me squirting my oil baking primer back into the bottle. Someone send help. I’m turning fully immature

2654 2018-05-24 19:00:10 On the 1-day Aromatherapy course, as well as talking about the Essential oils, I will also talk about the healing properties of Carrier oils such as Rosehip oil, Olive Oil, Sunflower oil, Argan oil, Sweet Almond oil.
Only 2 spaces now left on the course - 23rd June
2655 2018-05-24 19:00:07 Nope. More snake oil salesmanship is more like it.
2656 2018-05-24 19:00:07 Ok I have a cooking question. Do you wait for your pan to heat up before you add your oil?

2663 2018-05-24 18:59:24 It's not about the environment. It's about the environmental groups being paid by Tides and U.S. oil companies trying to land lock Alberta's resources.

2671 2018-05-24 18:58:25 Perhaps, but I don’t think so for many of the ones I’ve been getting. There’s been so much misinformation / confusion / snake oil around about GDPR and there’s been a lot of unnecessary panic in the past week or so. The whole thing’s been really badly rolled out

2722 2018-05-24 18:53:19 Kids aren't dying for sensible gun laws. Kids are dying because parents aren't teaching kids responsibility, society has gotten so lax that there is routine violence & because politicians are snake oil salesmen that tells you taking guns will fix all that.
2723 2018-05-24 18:53:16 lil dab of olive oil
2724 2018-05-24 18:53:14 good thing those founders don't exist. They were well aware of firearm tech. Look up girandoni air rifle, pickle gun, Belton flint lock. Do you even history, bro?

2727 2018-05-24 18:52:41 Estamos en indy, podemos tener una charla en lucas oil?
2728 2018-05-24 18:52:41 For dinner I made a rocket, cucumber, feta, pistachio&pine nuts salad, topped with a honey &chili oil dressing with grilled peppers and aubergine on the side and then paired it with a selection of cheap chicken goujons because I'm a genius unlikely to be recognised in my own time
2729 2018-05-24 18:52:39 Oh Mr. Rai. I can see ur frustration. You wanted Congress to govern Karnataka and u failed it. Now u want to put global oil price increase into central govt. Pls understand in an oil producing land petrol price is nearly 40 INR/ltr.
2730 2018-05-24 18:52:13 Why does CBD oil taste like actual dirt, soil and slugs
2731 2018-05-24 18:52:04 Has anyone tried castor oil to induce labor ?
2732 2018-05-24 18:51:46 I don’t get why it always takes over an hour at Ole Ben Franklin Ford for an oil change.
2733 2018-05-24 18:51:37 I am amazed he even asked for oil direct he nahi kaha nuggets fry kardo 
2734 2018-05-24 18:51:36 Karnatka me jab thorra Chalna pàda to aag-babula ho gayi thi , aur oil ke price ki chinta karti hai.Yadi chinta hi karni hài rajnetawo ko to ek din saptah mè gadi se nahi chale.

2736 2018-05-24 18:51:15 Oil and gold....both phased out 
Our economy can run on unicorn farts
2737 2018-05-24 18:51:09 ke ya go dirang that Oil
2738 2018-05-24 18:50:51 as a society, where have we landed on coconut oil?
2739 2018-05-24 18:50:45 Dyson was a turn off and very insulting. Then at the end when Fry called Dyson's delivery like that of a 'snake oil salesman' he turned around and characterized that statement as racist. Weaksauce.
2740 2018-05-24 18:50:42 First everybody is bitchin because the oil field was down and there wasn't any jobs; now everyone is bitchin because gas prices are high. Y'all just like to bitch don't ya.
2741 2018-05-24 18:50:41 My poor car needs a car wash, gas, an oil change, new brakes. I shouldn’t be allowed to own a car  lol
2742 2018-05-24 18:50:36 Met with @Suncor #Mgmt 2day. Operations r running well; #oil prices r way up & the stock has been a rocket. Concerning that Mgmt is considering a #buyback at elevated levels - very questionable #capital allocation. A special dividend would be more prudent #energy #invest $SU
2743 2018-05-24 18:50:29 If all you need is an oil change you should be able to do it yourself. Spark plugs should be easy too depending on what models you have
2744 2018-05-24 18:50:22 I could give a rat’s a$$ less. I fought for lower oil prices & refereed a ISIS turf war.  This said, I’ll stand with 76K of my best friends every Sunday.  Kneel if you have to. I don’t care. Since 1812, none of our servicemen fought for a piece of cloth: We fought for each other.
2745 2018-05-24 18:50:16 I finished of the teacher today for a Hedge School scene I've been working on. They need a few more coats of oil and then they will be ready for installation in their new home. As always, please feel free to share, many thanks, Will
2746 2018-05-24 18:50:02 Times I wish I still lived with my parents for help/their opinion. Come to get an oil change & they tell me my tires are bad & need to be replaced. I don't know anything about cars so I'm trusting they know what they're saying. I just don't know whether I'm being overcharged. 
2747 2018-05-24 18:50:02 Clint and Nat sharing a room even if they aren’t dating

2748 2018-05-24 18:50:01 I challenge @RahulGandhi to walk the talk if PM is not reducing the oil prices then rahul must take the lead and tell Punjab and Karnataka govt to slash oil prices . #PeTrolled
2749 2018-05-24 18:49:53 African countries have oil, gas, gold,diamonds and many other minerals. Africa is not poor, but Africans are poor. #Africaday
2750 2018-05-24 18:49:49 Well, I am really hoping for women to speak out. I know one girl’s story firsthand
2751 2018-05-24 18:49:07 girl yes! my favorite is black caster oil and flax seed!!! ugh im so mad... these product too damn pricey lol
2752 2018-05-24 18:49:03 no, sanctions  imposed by the US restricts market access period because the USD is the standard as a means of exchange for trade. that's why Venezuela dropped it for oil trade.

2755 2018-05-24 18:48:53 Face facts we're shielded. Provincial sector employer and service provision. Govt not enough oilsands uncertainty. Old resources not enough. Need oil n gaa and larger strategy of strength. Top priority.
2756 2018-05-24 18:48:53 Que interesante. Ahora resulta que el rosado en Bélgica nunca habló con su ministro de inteligencia

O sea que la Secretaría por su cuenta espiaba a ciudadanos

Y pregunto, y los informes de esas operaciones, que no eran para el rosado, para quien eran?

No me la trago ni con oil
2757 2018-05-24 18:48:50 Packed house here at the #stateofthecity address by @doniveson, who is talking about pipelines and the importance of getting oil and gas market access #yegcc
2758 2018-05-24 18:48:38 Just thinking of @DoireCelt 's neighbours cause he is on a half day and in good weather he has a tendency to sit out in garden with his speedos on and body covered in crisp and dry cooking oil
2759 2018-05-24 18:48:36 Edmonton was previously shielded by being a provincial capital and a service provider for the oil sands, says Iveson.
But that's not enough. TransMountain is vital, but that's not enough. #yegcc
2760 2018-05-24 18:48:36 Just that your factoids don't give the full picture. 1. No grid to power more than the 5000 inhabitants of Pevek in place yet (they work on that); 2. It is to power also new oil and gas exploitation; 3. It is the first of a series, to power more fossil exploitation of the Arctic.
2761 2018-05-24 18:48:25 I forgot what the product was called but it’s a mixture of, I think, flax seed oil/jojoba oil and it’s pretty thick. Slicks my natural edges down nice. I’ll post a pic when I get a chance.
2762 2018-05-24 18:48:22 จัดไป
2763 2018-05-24 18:48:22 Apples and pears. A gas explosion in a house can hardly be compared with a burning oil deposit. One is a locally limited event, the other has far-reaching consequences for the environment. In Germany there is a minimum distance of 1000 meters, which also applies to gas pipelines.
2764 2018-05-24 18:48:11 I use olive oil eco styler and pro style black gel. I’m trying to find new ones though!!
2765 2018-05-24 18:48:08 U.S. oil benchmark prices end at a nearly 2-week low
2766 2018-05-24 18:48:05 We are all over the earth posion by toxic chemical weapons that have been leaking for decades like shell oil 3M corporate crime against the citizens of the earth we are all walking posoin, I think it's time these evil men pay claims to the people of the earth
2767 2018-05-24 18:48:05 Looks like they got all the oil outta there, no problem...
2768 2018-05-24 18:48:04 Pappu going berserk.Fuel prices rising,Govt cess are funding the AAM AADMI schemes.Did the guy go to school.Higher oil prices only hurting the rich.
2769 2018-05-24 18:48:04 I knew she was gonna sing this with ALL the oil and anointing when she said "why do I feel so emptyaaaahhhh". The church jumped out
2770 2018-05-24 18:47:57 Trump made sure that the Iran deal failed. All he needed was for Bibi to do a little brown-nosing and for Vlad to be happy with rising oil prices. You have to be the stupidest country on the planet to allow such things to happen.
2771 2018-05-24 18:47:56 B) we are among the leaders in oil production in the world. We dont need to sacrifice more of our troops to have more.
2772 2018-05-24 18:47:40 Oil rice + palm nut soup 
2773 2018-05-24 18:47:25 I once saw Ak. senator F. Murkowski show where Canada has oil production facilities at border of ANWR, but have never seen anyone since show Canada's footprint since. It's as if Canada doesn't exist.
2774 2018-05-24 18:47:18 id say the oil companies owning all of america, is a huge threat to start ups with solar power and electric power and hence I imagine elon didnt wanted to take as little risk as possible, but I could be wrong. he mite had all three of his companies fail and be elon the homelessrn
2775 2018-05-24 18:47:05 It always looks like you're drilling for oil.
2776 2018-05-24 18:46:26 @Channel4News did a clip on his involvement in the bidding for the Royal Albert Dock. €160K went to Tory party that helped oil the wheels to allocate the winning bid. @BorisJohnson I'm not one to talk behind a mans back just to let you know whats being said about your good self.
2777 2018-05-24 18:46:26 European countries such as Norway are leading the world in what needs to be done to save our planet. If we really must sell oil then we need to use the profits to build green infrastructure

 What did I do in the war? Son, I watched a download bar and drank the last thing in the house. I ran the show on meshugaas the way some ancient dynamo we couldn’t replace would only go on walnut oil or cherry must. My poems sucked. My guitar grew dust.

2788 2018-05-24 18:45:24 Mfs wanna flex in a bmw but can’t afford an oil change ? 
2789 2018-05-24 18:44:55 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
2790 2018-05-24 18:44:55 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2791 2018-05-24 18:44:52 All these people that follow to unfollow may god not back you and drop you inside hot oil.
2792 2018-05-24 18:44:50 LMAO what you need to do is go find some generic ass shampoo and beard oil for yo shit...dirty head and face lil boi...OXY Clean will clean all that shit up, thats the only thing that can save you
2793 2018-05-24 18:44:47 I wonder how and why Nospectco folded up, the company was into the importation of AGO and BASE OIL
2794 2018-05-24 18:44:43 What's Nigeria waiting before pump price of fuel is dropped! crude oil price is on the rise!
2795 2018-05-24 18:44:31 Jiffy lube always has some type of coupon going on their oil changes. Just make it very clear that an oil change is the only thing you want. They try to add on other shit

2798 2018-05-24 18:44:21 A few conditions apply to Exxon's decision that may not be in the books of other "big oil" 
1- Exxon fields are quite older in age than other "big oil" 
2- Reserves decline and reserves replacement is far more pressing for other "big oil" 
3- Stratigic access
2799 2018-05-24 18:44:13 The selective appeasement policy ( for inherent vested interest ? ) of Congress in power, during 2008 forced it to postpone self-effective oil-price-control mechanism planned, on protest or lobbying from a  private oil Company. Again proved it as 'Evil for India' .
2800 2018-05-24 18:44:12 Cosrx oil free moisturizer with birch sap! I use it in the winter and summer on my combo skin

2805 2018-05-24 18:43:31 add some olive oil and lemon juice on it too 
2806 2018-05-24 18:43:29 It's not in the hands of WM. Scotland gets a fiscal transfer of £10b a year from WM, Scotland's deficit including full allocation (90 odd%) of oil revenues is close to -£15b. These are the facts.
2807 2018-05-24 18:43:07 Legit the first thing I do when I wake up is get the essential oil diffuser going. It’s a habit.
2808 2018-05-24 18:42:58 Also, you may want to consider facial oils instead of moisturizer for a deeper hydration. Rosehip oil or Moroccan oil are amazing. Andalou and Trader Joe’s have great products of each! Drunken elephant is awesome too but hella coin

2812 2018-05-24 18:42:41 The story of Trump's life is 'train wreck'. Trumpcasinogate, Trumpsteakgate, Trumpuniversitygate.... how many bankruptcies were there? What's surprising is how many believe he was a successful businessman, and thought he'd be a good POTUS. A snake oil salesman perhaps, but...

2814 2018-05-24 18:42:27 Oil prices aren't going to come down. Diesel should be taxed lower for usage in public transport. In trucks, buses, taxis etc. Otherwise, things will go worse.

2818 2018-05-24 18:42:18 I literally buy everything that has coconut oil/smells like coconut, I have an obsession  
2819 2018-05-24 18:42:13 Can’t recommend no curling creams but Castor oil is bomb. Makes your hair grow, keeps it moisturized, it’ll give it a nice shine, and it’s a thick, heavy oil so your waves will be smooth and laid.
2820 2018-05-24 18:42:11 I was torn between trying that and the Black Castir oil one. That’s def next up!
2821 2018-05-24 18:42:05 I didn't see any accident along the way. The fuel in the Danfo I took finished and I had to trek from Capital oil to Berger.

2825 2018-05-24 18:41:40 @SenSchumer based on your Iran comments, apparently u now believe gas prices are a problem and that increased oil production is the answer. Correct? If so, why would u prefer increased production to come from Iran rather than US? Better to fund terror or domestic job creation?

2828 2018-05-24 18:41:26 I completely understand! My first real job involved working at conferences in oil and gas. I had to yell for CEOs and Presidents to get back in the session rooms. It was sooo nerve-wracking the first 50 some times!
2829 2018-05-24 18:41:08 Bro I’m starving and this oil change is taking forever 
2830 2018-05-24 18:40:55 I just read that n honestly the only one that works halfway decent with my hair is the olive oil one but I need more hold so I planned on switching but thanks rae 
2831 2018-05-24 18:40:36 Its got to be to the Fred Dibnah theme song. The dirty oil stained Bolton bastard.
2832 2018-05-24 18:40:31 You gotta try the new coconut oil one!!! It’s amazing for the curls
2833 2018-05-24 18:40:30 Ahhh...... dang! I'll have to bring it up with my roommate; her dad is a vet so I'd like to hear his thoughts on it. For a diffuser we just have a little cup with a candle under it that we light to heat the oil, nothing fancy, and the cat's never been interested in it.
2834 2018-05-24 18:40:24 Oil is like acrylic! Gouche sucks because its a different value when it's wet and when you apply it so you kinda have to guess the color you're getting. dries so fast you can't mix it. It's like all the worst aspects of acrylic and watercolor put together.
2835 2018-05-24 18:40:24 just got to get to the show room ,then onto route 66
2836 2018-05-24 18:40:14 If they can steal things like NYS boys & girls, kits for Rio Olympics etc, what about oil in Turkana? I think extraction of oil should be postponed till better administration takes over.  #NYSscandal

2839 2018-05-24 18:39:58 Donald Trump has stood up to the Russians in many more ways than Obama did. He is placed US missiles back into Eastern Europe. He has destroyed Russian assets in Syria. He has expanded domestic oil. He has not sold uranium assets to Russians like Obama.
2840 2018-05-24 18:39:52 My Scouse mate, Tony, has been drilling down in his back garden for 12 years, he’s built a set of tunnels that connect with the Ukrainian oil pipelines just south of Krakow, the pipeline will carry him to Kiev’s main sewage system where he’ll surface an hour before kick-off!
2841 2018-05-24 18:39:49 Tell that to the dead and the victims of terrorism! Oil is of strategic and economic importance for our stability and way of life! These people want to kill us and are the enemies of freedom and democracy!

2850 2018-05-24 18:39:22 because I applied only a very fine layer of vegetable oil and still had problems. I'm also going to try baking the seasoning in for an hour as you suggested. I went with Serious Eats' (who typically don't do me wrong) instructions to do 4-5 sessions of 30 minutes each...
2851 2018-05-24 18:39:18 Please, stop this, you dnt know the struggle of trying to make all  of them here without my grandmother's palm oil. . They just dnt taste the same 
2852 2018-05-24 18:39:15 @narendramodi
You should draw a line within your cabinet that this should be the maximum limit of petroleum products in the country and if the crude oil prices are going beyond the limit then the Government should act in order to restrict the price within the limits.
2853 2018-05-24 18:39:13 Lol of course, I’m talking of the one with palm oil 
2854 2018-05-24 18:39:02 Let me brief u abt the issue.transformer requires some kind of oil.which if done,will stop the fuse from burning and thus avoid causing untimely power outage.But to do such nominal work the staff has been procrastinating since day one.
2855 2018-05-24 18:38:57 Boys put Sweet almond oil and Bitter almond oil in the beard oil? What to heck
2856 2018-05-24 18:38:55 How do you think the sanctions are affecting oil prices
2857 2018-05-24 18:38:51 Oil comes from there.
2858 2018-05-24 18:38:43 Coconut oil just does it all I guess
2859 2018-05-24 18:38:42 Vile stuff, I don’t mind it in brine or spring water but oil? No thanks.
2860 2018-05-24 18:38:42 Seriously ? 
You have no idea what you're on about.
It was all about the oil, nothing else.
2861 2018-05-24 18:38:42 Beans with palm oil and bread
2862 2018-05-24 18:38:34 No mr. Oliver that's really not a thing the swamp isn't drained it just has new monsters I have no idea what anointed means besides prayed over in touched with oil which doesn't impress me much and no one from the Obama admin is going to jail BC they didn't do anything unlawful
2863 2018-05-24 18:38:29 well i still have half a jar of the olive oil eco gel soooo... imma have to finish that jar before i use different brand
2864 2018-05-24 18:38:28 Ye sala parody wala modi bhakt hai...dusre k naam pe account kholke chutiyapa karta hai..
Isko crude oil kya hota hai malum hi nahi hai...
2865 2018-05-24 18:38:28 Lol,
Illiterate.

That is just assumption while Iran foreign minister thanked India & china for buying thier oil is fact.
2866 2018-05-24 18:38:24 Cook literally anything in a cast iron + coconut oil
2867 2018-05-24 18:38:24 Oil will be delivered by trucks. It’s an Early Oil Pilot scheme. Essentially symbolic and a chance for Kenya to test the international market. Kenya plans to build an oil pipeline from Turkana to Lamu by 2021- that’s when exports of actual commercial export will begin.
2868 2018-05-24 18:38:12 Coconut oil
2869 2018-05-24 18:38:08 dry skin? coconut oil want longer hair? coconut oil your heart is broken? rub some coconut oil on it b you gon be alright
2870 2018-05-24 18:38:00 Narak me olive oil me nehlaye jaoge
2871 2018-05-24 18:37:49 On a motorway, it means that there is a service area ahead, where you can pull in, park up, and have a cup of tea, while your metal engine parts weld themselves together, through lack of oil. 
2872 2018-05-24 18:37:48 Yeah, it takes a bit to get acclimated. I've found that putting a ton of potassium salt (Morton's Lite salt is good) helps a lot, as does eating more fat than you think is reasonable (coconut oil especially is great for quicker energy). 

It gets easier every time to acclimate
2873 2018-05-24 18:37:37 Eating organic  and drinking water  that has been through a reverse osmosis process can decrease the amount of fluoride you’re exposed to. They literally put it in pesticides because it is neurotoxic to organisms. Skate liver oil  is known to decalcify the pineal gland too.
2874 2018-05-24 18:37:35 Somebody gets mauled by a polar bear on federal land leased by the oil companies, do you sue the BLM and Big Oil because of the polar bear?
2875 2018-05-24 18:37:26 Thanks love! I've just ordered some sand paper and steel wool. I don't have a sander but I'm hoping elbow grease will take care of it. I like your tip for using the sponge to apply the oil instead of a paper towel--I'm wondering if the paper towel is part of what did me in before
2876 2018-05-24 18:37:25 I do actually do real oil paintings, though.  They're not quite this good but they're getting there.
2877 2018-05-24 18:37:23 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President:  Hearing lots of complaints from regulars @ the local pub about the price of gas. $3.29 a gallon just down the street. Have u considered nationalizing the oil companies?  Gotta do something 2 rein n the bad guys, and ur the best @ reining in.
2878 2018-05-24 18:37:20 Isn't that something.. people sometimes take better care of their cars than their health. Wash it every week, wax it, change oil, put in higher fuel..etc.
2879 2018-05-24 18:37:16 I like tea tree oil as an inexpensive spot treatment due to its antibacterial properties. It works quickly for me but it has a strong odor.
2880 2018-05-24 18:37:14 And tea tree oil does dry your skin up only if it’s too concentrated that’s why I said use coconut oil too
2881 2018-05-24 18:36:56 "The key for sustainability in this space is changing the investment paradigm for drilling funds. If you raise money early in the year, you can function like a real oil company." -#IPAwebinar panelist
2882 2018-05-24 18:36:56 Pretty interesting that those overlaps also happen to be right in the heart of oil & gas country, too
2883 2018-05-24 18:36:53 Aren’t the populations of all the Nordic countries combined about the same as L.A. County and N.Y. City combined? And don’t they have massive oil reserves? Do you think their policies might differ if they had a population even close to 25% of the us population (roughly 80 mil)?
2884 2018-05-24 18:36:45 AWESOME NK IS CHINAS PUPPET......SANCTIONS ON CHINA BANKS....EMBARGO ON VENEZUELA OIL....PUT NUKES IN JAPAN
2885 2018-05-24 18:36:29 It works SUPER well, and takes no effort past chopping the onions up. Add a little olive oil, mix it up, leave on low for ~10 hours.
2886 2018-05-24 18:36:25 Cantu leave-in conditioner with argon oil seems pretty good thus far..
2887 2018-05-24 18:35:36 he has been trying to do everything but is being blocked at every turn the DUMBOCRAPS and the RINO'S won't let the president run his agenda which included new oil exploration and to stop sending our oil to countries that hate America
2888 2018-05-24 18:35:34 I wish a young (but of age) sexy pool boy was fanning me and another one was rubbing me down with oil 
2889 2018-05-24 18:35:30 #Channel4News Funny how these #wars that are nothing to do with the #west are always where there,s #oil or #resources.... must just be coincidence?????
2890 2018-05-24 18:35:30 Ooo I just looked up before and after pics for bio oil.
It seems to work really well with scars! Do you think it will help with dark spots/sun spots?
2891 2018-05-24 18:35:29 So what we gonna do with all that oil & gas off-shore? Tell the oil companies to GTF?
2892 2018-05-24 18:35:14 A full body massage w/ coco oil, listening to the weeknd. A mood.
2893 2018-05-24 18:35:13 To aap Ye bata de ki modi ko kya sahukh chadha hai petrol ki daam bhadane ka wo to international market me crued oil ki Kimat bhadha hai islye badha hai
2894 2018-05-24 18:35:08 Did you use an application for this or is this a real oil painting ?
2895 2018-05-24 18:35:08 You don’t even need oil
2896 2018-05-24 18:35:07 After 2 days, the 70 year old, 3000L oil tank emerges. 
#IslandLife #oil
2897 2018-05-24 18:35:05 Why is something in the national interest when the nation as a whole doesn't benefit much? Just the oil companies and staff do in a dying industry.
2898 2018-05-24 18:35:01 Ooooooooh yum. What sort of veg oil?
2899 2018-05-24 18:35:01 Now someone has signed that he and those people who can benefit from the medical cannibis oil cant get scripts. This boy has only 2wks meds
2900 2018-05-24 18:34:58 I'm talking about the fact that he's brought in Wall Street Executives and Big Oil CEOs in order to apparently drain the swamp. Meanwhile his personal lawyer is taking millions of dollars and kickbacks from corporate and foreign interest.
2901 2018-05-24 18:34:52 I see the oil rigs
2902 2018-05-24 18:34:50 WWIII back on lol? That's the goal of these barstards.. to attack Afghanistan/Iraq/Syria/Libya/Iran/NK et al.. gold bunkers and alien devices.. and good old fashioned oil.. and regime change.. not because they think they're good or bad.. just good or bad for the oil..
2903 2018-05-24 18:34:45 The Lord himself will have to return and pry the Argan oil eco gel from my hands before I give up my slick buns. I’m here for a good time not a long time.
2904 2018-05-24 18:34:39 Who tryna invest in me some thc oil & a vape pen 
2905 2018-05-24 18:34:34 Oil sold at 100 or even 50, d big truth is dat there was too much looting in d country between d said year and now. We can never get it right if we continue like dis
2906 2018-05-24 18:34:27 Madam Oby, are you saying the government you were part of, that was in government for sixteen years, with more than $500billion revenue from oil sales, without anything to show for it. No good road. No water or electricity supply, poverty among the citizens, should come back?
2907 2018-05-24 18:34:09 (And it also matters that 100% of Norway's success in the last few decades comes from oil revenues.)
2908 2018-05-24 18:34:02 And anyone who thinks Canada’s export industries - including oil and gas - create no economic benefit for BC and Canada as a whole clearly isn’t paying much attention.
2909 2018-05-24 18:33:56 Sir seen yuva live fantastic figures on oil utilisation as expected from modiji

2911 2018-05-24 18:33:42 Gotta get a oil change and my hair done 
2912 2018-05-24 18:33:27 Hey Becky @jrosejunior1975, I hear @Oil_Guns_Merica proposes by DMs.  Should I introduce you two!
2913 2018-05-24 18:33:24 Went to get an oil change today. My uncle yelled at me. Apparently it’s not okay to be in the negatives with oil life.  I thought people do that all the time???
2914 2018-05-24 18:33:19 Wen crude oil price went down, jaitlie kept increasing the excise duty, greed...
2915 2018-05-24 18:33:15 Coconut Oil Only Lol
2916 2018-05-24 18:33:02 Ooh PTA h tuje kitna vat + tax lag raha Hain petrol PE abi and crude oil kitte ka mil raha Hain or 2014 ke baad kitna % bda Hain ye  sab Bhai ouhnohe apni Jeb bhar li Hain ...
2917 2018-05-24 18:32:52 So after a few weeks of using them.... I can say that Gunnars are not quite the snake oil that I thought they were.  Definitely helps with laser focusing in games D:
2918 2018-05-24 18:32:45 Gone fucking mental and it’s going to increase as the price of crude oil has risen massively! Expect to see £1.30 a litre soon for petrol and £1.35 for diesel
2919 2018-05-24 18:32:38 @foxandfriends #HempBombs #HempBombsLove. @realDonaldTrump Research & Legalize CBD oil for pain relief without THC
2920 2018-05-24 18:32:36 Getting an oil change and went over to Arby’s to kill time. This would be my 5th straight day eating a burger... Regrets, but it’s the American diet way!
2921 2018-05-24 18:32:32 Just coconut oil dissolved in water? Does it have similar health benefits? I’m gonna have to try
2922 2018-05-24 18:32:32 U.S. crude #oil futures settle at $70.71/bbl. $1.13. -1.57%. #CME #NYMEX $CL_N7 #OOTT

2923 2018-05-24 18:32:26 He will hit the streets running mad naked, he's a criminal that used to benefit from oil bunkering now that PMB has stopped he just can't get himself together again.
2924 2018-05-24 18:32:18 I'm lathering myself in tanning oil lmao im gonna be crispy this summer
2925 2018-05-24 18:32:15 "Oil Price will not fall below $100 a Barrel" - "Yes it will".
2926 2018-05-24 18:32:13 We’ll trade their oil for a box of sweet TAGS pencils
2927 2018-05-24 18:32:07 IDGAF if my car on fire  I came for an oil change....nothing else!!!
2928 2018-05-24 18:32:04 Like who? Could do with some suggestions my friend. This is a nation wide problem, whether a state is oil rich or not, it is a reflection of the value we place on Education and Learning. Sad isn’t it?
2929 2018-05-24 18:31:50 if the global slowdown has started like some data suggests, how does this go much higher for much longer? Inflation? How much of the price rise in lumber or oil is merited or rising on crazy analysis of supply/demand/momentum chasers? I'm not as convinced of its LT durability.
2930 2018-05-24 18:31:43 I knew about hemp oil, hemp fabric and rope, and of course the good old dank weed, but I've never heard of hemp milk. What's it like?
2931 2018-05-24 18:31:37 High oil prices always benefit the Russians
2932 2018-05-24 18:31:26 bio oil
2933 2018-05-24 18:31:24 37 ke as pas ka petrol ata h,  gst agr maximum se maximum bhi lgaye to 28% + cess bhi lgade tb bhi 50 cross nhi krega try krke dekhlo 48 ke as pas aayeva.. Still a better way to reduce the prices of oil instead of reducing excise duty which may up and down in future...
2934 2018-05-24 18:31:15 And Sterling will cease being classified as an oil based currency the moment we become independent. Another 15% drop in value to add to the initial 15% drop in value after Brexit vote and the expected additional 15% drop after U.K. leaves EU! Good news for U.K. all round!
2935 2018-05-24 18:31:03 Thank you deep fryer for splattering hot ass oil all over my arm 
2936 2018-05-24 18:31:02 Just like the war in #Iraq was to be paid for with oil...
2937 2018-05-24 18:30:57 I can’t get up, when the threads have more than 10 people I have to mute, gets too much lol. I miss the news then trying to keep up!
2938 2018-05-24 18:30:55 The 'biggest' change in oil market history: A shipping revolution could prompt crude prices to soar

2939 2018-05-24 18:30:55 Naive little fellow.  Spanky thinks he can get Iran’s oil, which he’s been salivating over for years.
2940 2018-05-24 18:30:49 *2003 me crude oil ki price $25/barrel - petrol 29rs/L

*2006  crude oil ki price $74.77/barrel petrol 47rs/L

2941 2018-05-24 18:30:48 I'm out here trying to do an oil change and this guy ahead of me gets out of his car... tell me why the fuck does he have THREE guns?! #OnlyInDetroit
2942 2018-05-24 18:30:47 I actually prefer my eggs fried with margarine rather than cooking oil
2943 2018-05-24 18:30:44 As a young accountant I left the fishing industry 1980 to join Oil&Gas told it would never last  . Scotland has more historic knowledge of multi currency/ petrodollars than the MSM likes. 
But as The Nort Sea is finished . Glad I’m retired .

2948 2018-05-24 18:30:19 is that gun oil
2949 2018-05-24 18:30:18 Sometimes both! Certain diffusers send more oil physically into the air, which cats can end up ingesting. Some oils are okay when really diluted, but I can't find solid resources that agree what those oils are, so it's better to keep them away from cats altogether
2950 2018-05-24 18:30:16 We don't have oil in India bring corruption money to us we can make India proud and developing or otherwise it Is undeveloped
2951 2018-05-24 18:30:10 My mom filled up the gas and took it for an oil change but that was it. And now they're getting defensive about it when it's like. Someone broke it while I was gone and they're going to be the one to fix it. So.
2952 2018-05-24 18:30:09 But rest assured if they find oil, coal, other minerals he will let corporations trash the areas in a second. You guys in District 1 can pick them dumb and deplorable.
2953 2018-05-24 18:30:08 Bought me a big jar of coconut oil today for my hair . Lol I’m super excited
2954 2018-05-24 18:30:02 Mai ghutne se chal nhi pata accident ki wajah se koi oil ho ya upchaar tell me
2955 2018-05-24 18:29:55 That day Indian Oil Basket was $124/barrel and current crude basket rate just crossed $84/barrel.
2956 2018-05-24 18:29:55 Crude oil prices are back to $70 for the first time in years. We’ll see if this takes some pressure off of oilfield companies who have been getting crushed.
2957 2018-05-24 18:29:54 You do realise that while the President of the country (whomever he may be) can have some influence over the appreciation & depreciation of the LOCAL currency; the President has little to no influence over the GLOBAL oil price?
2958 2018-05-24 18:29:52 Nothing like a oil change in ya whip... It feels almost as good as getting a new pair of socks....
2959 2018-05-24 18:29:48 Ima try it tho cause I have some already. I’m so sad, I love the Argan oil one :(
2960 2018-05-24 18:29:35 18 HRS THO, MIGHT WANT TO CHECK YOUR OIL AND TIRES ONCE IN WHILE AT LEAST..
2961 2018-05-24 18:29:35 Right! It's fun to use "their media" to make your argument because u disarm them of their - stop listening to Fox News answer. Good times
2962 2018-05-24 18:29:06 I wonder if Mike's got his next job picked out.  Bank lobbyist?  Oil lobbyist?  Gun lobbyist?
2963 2018-05-24 18:29:05 Waiting for my car to get oil changed... so if anybody wants to meet me at mimosa house for some brunch I’d be down lol
2964 2018-05-24 18:29:04 Completely disgusting thing to say. So @JennyMarra cross the floor,join the blue Tories. Thatcher destroyed Scotland's industry whilst stealing our oil.
2965 2018-05-24 18:29:02 Jobs were never the point. The real goal has always been to secure the wealth of coal and oil barons for a few decades longer. If that ends up ending life on Earth as we know it, well, that's no big deal for them.
2966 2018-05-24 18:29:00 what happened to Porsche1 ?
2967 2018-05-24 18:28:57 All it takes is one properly placed lightning strike
2968 2018-05-24 18:28:56 Sure. Do it again.  .Ask them how they like giving their so-called tax cuts to Big Oil in higher gas prices.
2969 2018-05-24 18:28:51 You’re so uninformed. 

Trump is making the military stronger. Iran is a Russian ally. He obliterated a Russian battalion trying to take over oil fields in Syria. He gave weapons to Ukraine.
2970 2018-05-24 18:28:47 Snake oil in reference to a cancer cure. As for other conditions, I agree. PTSD, chronic pain, nausea and many other conditions/ ailments etc.

2975 2018-05-24 18:28:02 May have picked top here in oil.
2976 2018-05-24 18:27:55 Everyday explosion at exactly crude oil settlement time.... Aramco IPO preparation?
2977 2018-05-24 18:27:52 So they want every drop of oil. Why would that be? Not for good reasons. I shall keep repeating, for anyone  with integrity the fight has to be on the educational front with the correct curriculum. I would still negotiate with @realDonaldTrump because there is noone else.
2978 2018-05-24 18:27:51 Good thing Clinton isn’t running and hasn’t held public office in 6 years then. We’re talking about Ted Cruz, who has raised millions of dollars from defense contractors, the oil industry, the gun lobby and billionaires like the Koch family who just want tax cuts for themselves

2983 2018-05-24 18:27:18 Not coconut oil. I rejected one proposal because of the rank, rancid coconut oil smell.
2984 2018-05-24 18:27:05 You are a club that is only relevant because of oil money 
2985 2018-05-24 18:27:02 This is how the eye-witness, Leutnant (S) Julius C. Schmitz-Westerholt, a combat artist assigned to the Prinz Eugen, depicted the destruction of the Hood on an oil painting. He was there.
2986 2018-05-24 18:26:55 Why doesn’t Iran just give the oil back to the US and UK?

Like before 1953?

Then there would be peace, eh?
2987 2018-05-24 18:26:48 Just in time for to kick off summer this Memorial Day weekend.  The teak set is only 375! Just needs some oil and it will look like new! The hutch was redone by a customer with our paint exchange paints and donated back.
2988 2018-05-24 18:26:42 US administration wants war, because in fact it is an Oil/Arms dealing cartel ehuch gas an army for rent.
2989 2018-05-24 18:26:41 Allah's will is to see #oil at $100.
Enjoy!!
2990 2018-05-24 18:26:32 Kindly share this formula with me. We need to know what are the constants and what are the variables in this Kenyan oil matrix.

2992 2018-05-24 18:26:21 Hello. I am from the future. In 2018, the US shale industry is stronger than ever. We have weaned our dependence on foreign oil and are actually a net exporter of natural gas. #congrats #legacy
2993 2018-05-24 18:26:12 Kill the oil biz and nuclear power. With Vulcan steam power and hydrogen driven car's and lorry's.Butangas work good and Ethan to.
2994 2018-05-24 18:25:53 Yeah. This time I used a different recipe since we didn’t have butter I used coconut oil so that might be what’s missing
2995 2018-05-24 18:25:53 I wouldn’t be upset if she was forced to drink hot oil
2996 2018-05-24 18:25:53 The aloe really soothes the skin if you have eczema and cetaphil just helps with dryness but coconut oil and tea tree oil is good too NOT TOO MUCH tea tree though
2997 2018-05-24 18:25:43 >sonatas instead of fugues

Y'all nillas oil lamps, get on my LED level bitches
2998 2018-05-24 18:25:38 Not sure if I put on too much cologne or beard oil. Either way I smell amazing.
2999 2018-05-24 18:25:35 Diplomacy and open relationships will always triumph the disastrous confrontation. The US administration is an Arms/Oil cartel with an army for rent. Please keep calm and continue the good work. Thanks!
3000 2018-05-24 18:25:34 I need to buy me some more castor oil 
3001 2018-05-24 18:25:33 Foolish Reno, stop diverting serious issue. What Nigerians are asking are, what happened to more than $500billion realized from oil sales, sixteen years of PDP government? With poverty killing Nigerians everyday. No good road. Nothing is working. Very simple question.
3002 2018-05-24 18:25:27 Obesity crisis started when changes to food consumption caused man to move beyond his efficient frontier -  that began in 1977 when the government requested that industry create a further 2500 processed low fat products, and retool to add in om 6 oil and remove saturated fat -
3003 2018-05-24 18:25:17 Well, the Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry report of the essential oil of this admin will certainly indicate the presence of a Revillame.

3009 2018-05-24 18:24:40 India buys a large amount of oil from Iran. Due to international barrier Iran's payment gateway was blocked and India did not pay the oil price to Iran. In 2015 international barriers were lifted from Iran. In 2016 India paid its 43,000 crore to Iran.
3010 2018-05-24 18:24:37 Okay, but "they have oil" explains all of Norway's differences from the other Nordics. Norway works as analysis, not policy prescription.
3011 2018-05-24 18:24:32 It is and always has been about oil.
3012 2018-05-24 18:24:31 6 month lease on Faslane will cover that. An oil rich country with a trade surplus will have no problems setting up its own currency! Problem will be the devaluing of Sterling. That’s why BOE chief pushing currency union this week. They know Scotland is lost to them!
3013 2018-05-24 18:24:28 They should also require companies like CNN, Fox, etc. to reveal their sponsors, such as oil companies, car companies, and others that have vested interests in public policy.

3025 2018-05-24 18:23:21 The amount of people Great Britain has displaced over the years by meddling in the affairs of other countries (normally oil/mineral rich) is crime, the fact that a fraction end up here is only our own fault. #karma

3031 2018-05-24 18:22:55 Stopping one Canadian pipeline will reduce oil sales from Canada. The other oil producers will gladly supply more oil. World oil producers are thanking Canadian protestors. So who’s money is backing the Canadian #kindermorgan protestors?

3036 2018-05-24 18:22:35 @iceman5_7_3 Avoid grains. Explore the paleo diet. Eat all natural foods: Full fat organic/grass fed meats, fruits, veggies, healthy fats like almonds, avocados & coconut oil. Avoid starchy veggies and simple carbs. Only drink water. You'll lose weight and feel fuller longer.
3037 2018-05-24 18:22:33 Do you know, Sonia led UPA left unpaid bills for the oil Iran supplied?

India had owed $6.4 billion (Rs.41,600,00,00,000) to Iran for crude oil purchase made before Modi came to power. 

Before Modi's 2016 visit, payments started.

3039 2018-05-24 18:22:28 @realDonaldTrump Please PLEASE research & legalize CBD oil. It has no THC just provides pain relief w/o opioid.
3040 2018-05-24 18:22:23 I'm like trying to get my oil changed, and these ppl dont want to just...Answer a simple question
3041 2018-05-24 18:22:22 Got a long day ahead of me today, gotta get the maro prepped and cleaned, oil change, got a few errands and gotta pack for Vegas tomorrow
3042 2018-05-24 18:22:21 heres a good question
how many tankers would that be per day ??
3043 2018-05-24 18:22:19 Time to get our oil to tidal water, even if we have to get the GD Military  to build that pipeline. IMO
3044 2018-05-24 18:22:15 Oil was to be an added advantage to our growing economy, our sin was that we never thought it wise to diversify our economy, the experience flogs us today.
3045 2018-05-24 18:22:14 Just had similar experience in Liberty with three suity men wanting a nice bath oil for their ill friend and carefully canvassing opinion, my heart wasn’t ready for it
3046 2018-05-24 18:22:08 4) Crude Oil price itself. If it goes up another 20+% (as cyclically happens at this stage), the demand side will get crushed. In the US, w/gasoline around 4$ & all those gas guzzling trucks (with subprime fin) what could go wrong?
3047 2018-05-24 18:22:02 often oil isn't a mitigating factor when considering household wealth, but rather the main driver of wealth inequality. Norway created a SWF and have broad public ownership of stocks. they could've made different decisions.
3048 2018-05-24 18:21:54 tried to shove a million things I my face when I’m only getting an oil change LOL.

3050 2018-05-24 18:21:21 Pay day tomorrow! Just in time as I ordered engine oil for my car.
3051 2018-05-24 18:21:13 You can use all over, I do. But with lemon and orange essential oils it’s important to dilute them in a carrier oil (I use olive). I use them at night since they don’t interact well with the sun. I use rosehip oil during the day.

3055 2018-05-24 18:20:35 I voluntered.  I was called up in 1990 for Desert Storm. I knew it wasn't about freeing the Kuwaitis but about protecting Saudi oil.  I had a friend who was against the war.  All I asked him to do was protest the war, not the people fighting in it.

3062 2018-05-24 18:19:37 A few things immediately stand out:

A) BC doesn't want Alberta Oil. Fine. Shut it all off.  I'm sure they will enjoy walking. 

B) People who cut down forests don't appear to understand how a Carbon Sink works. 

C) Save the planet. Boycott BC forest products. Drink BC wine.

3066 2018-05-24 18:19:22 Of course, you members of PDP that were in power for sixteen years, with oil revenue of more than $500billon, and nothing to show for it, should all be afraid, of either been put in jail or face firing squad. That is what PDP leadership deserves, for looting the treasure. Crooks

3069 2018-05-24 18:18:48 Please do something to reduce the oil prices. Things are going out of hand & people are losing faith in you.
3070 2018-05-24 18:18:47 Add a little baking soda to the cooking oil.
3071 2018-05-24 18:18:46 I love the smell of Tung oil on a newly finished bow.

3073 2018-05-24 18:18:37 Already happened. The bank that carries the 'deed paper' on America (Comerica) has been bought into (stock) enough by Islamic oil cash that all it takes is a majority stockholder 'corporate takeover' to happen. Then, legally, islam wins America. See how that works?

3077 2018-05-24 18:17:35 That's exactly the problem: Oil cartels refuse to adapt; cynical trolls believe climate change is a scheme to generate profit in other ways.

3079 2018-05-24 18:17:13 I’m 100% behind Alberta. We have whiners here who benefit from big oil and business, but stridently look down on the businesses that bring prosperity.
3080 2018-05-24 18:17:08 This shows the ground reason for Iran dues weren't known by u..
I was on a ship loading crude oil from Kharg Island, Iran..
US has ceased dollar payments, so India has no option but to hold dues until settlement of currency were made
3081 2018-05-24 18:17:05 So many progressive, exciting, and young politicians currently coming up in the Central Valley. I'm thinking of Mayor @MichaelDTubbs of Stockton and Mayor @JoseGurrolaJr or Arvin - the latter is talking about some exciting oil regs and complete streets policies! #Greenlining25
3082 2018-05-24 18:16:40 Just needed that easy fix; That only they new about the oil and had already lost the farm. Can’t borrow money without disclosing the hidden asset.
3083 2018-05-24 18:16:39 I just remembered that at 3am my brother woke me up to ask if I had shaving cream. Why are you shaving this late? Had to teach him that you can use coconut oil to shave with
3084 2018-05-24 18:16:34 I’ve crafted my own spec for this job. First coat was linseed oil and white spirit. 2nd coat Zinseer cover stain mixed 50/50 with white spirit. It’s like milk and penetrate into the wood. Then Allcoat satin as base and allcoat gloss. 2 coats
3085 2018-05-24 18:16:32 I ran out of makeup wipes so I have to use coconut oil eventhough it clogs your pores :):
3086 2018-05-24 18:16:29 Thank you! I read that applying jojoba oil several times a day to the nail will make it more flexible so it will bend and not break easily, give it a try if you decide to grow them back again
3087 2018-05-24 18:16:20 Thank you  I’ll try that. I ran out of CBD oil and feel like a psycho
3088 2018-05-24 18:16:19 You are aware this is a phrase, I wasn’t suggesting your new hero is involved in the oil trade, snake or otherwise?
3089 2018-05-24 18:16:18 Switzerland is bigger than any economy in Africa.

It has only 8 million people, no oil, no gold, no bauxite, no arable land.
3090 2018-05-24 18:16:16 I agree with you that is not a panacea, it does work wonders for some conditions including some types of epilepsy..  I can testify on that . Just don’t compare it to snake oil .

3095 2018-05-24 18:16:00 LOL. Big oil put crappy brakes in his car?  Coded his autopilot to crash? Made it hard to build high volumes of high quality cars?  Big oil mandated an overblown Ipad to control and display all systems? 
3096 2018-05-24 18:15:58 Saleem fear God....watan Azumi ne.
3097 2018-05-24 18:15:54 Agreed on the strategy to invest heavily in renewable energy sources. I thought the downturn in the price of oil in early 2016 which led to a lot of tar sand operations ceasing would have been primetime to transition subsidies from oil companies to clean energy startups

3106 2018-05-24 18:15:11 MAGA isn’t nostalgia for the Reagan era, or the segregated 50’s even.

It’s the goal to return to the gilded age, where the oil and railroad barons are now Russian oligarchs and global corporations.

3112 2018-05-24 18:14:45 Amount was not paid due to sanction. It doesn't mean that oil companies transferred amount to government. MMS government had left foreign  reserves with 330b$ (from 110$). Even if money was emptied which is highly unlikely Modi could pay from reserves.

3117 2018-05-24 18:13:59 Yep.  Something “simple” like changing the oil filter requires ramps, the removal of a wheel-arch liner and arms made of rubber.  

Hell, I need to replace a running light bulb and even that requires the removal of the airbox!

3142 2018-05-24 18:11:42 Vikas, Nothing to check - you guys are doing an awesome job already! It was impressive to see that sales pitch from the team and finally due to that only I was convinced to opt Synthetic oil (expensive :P) and not the normal one!
3143 2018-05-24 18:11:38 You can lease for not much more than that and there is zero maintenance - no oil changes - no oil or water- no spark plugs- no gaskets - no smog cert - even brake pads don’t wear out

In Europe focus is less short-term focused, Norway has high adoption rate despite local oil prod.

3260 2018-05-24 17:58:40 Who’s paying for this?  It seems the new modern War is humans against nature & guess who’s losing? Say “no” to rising insurance premiums. Write letters to our MPs to recover these costs at the pump & from big oil. Let’s work to conserve oil & invest billions in renewables

3265 2018-05-24 17:58:23 i am reading about the history governance in  nigeria since 1950s,,
whatever Kenya is going through now happened in Nigeria in the 1970s so we're a long way to and please factor in that Nigeria is/was the 8th highest producer of oil
3266 2018-05-24 17:58:23 That's it and the Japanese made sure that all I need is regular oil changes. LOL
3267 2018-05-24 17:58:16 Sorry, Midland, Texas... Middy is how oil traders refer to the oil price differential between Midland, TX, and Cushing, Oklahoma. Those are two important oil pricing points in the US.

3290 2018-05-24 17:56:21 Compare d crude oil barrel price & Indian price.
3291 2018-05-24 17:56:05 Except Progressives reject God. The DNC booed God three times, remember?
3292 2018-05-24 17:56:05 Also, when the economy improves, there is more demand for oil/gas, more demand equals higher gas prices.
3293 2018-05-24 17:56:03 Well, yeah, what else do you do with cooking oil?

3298 2018-05-24 17:55:29 Seems turning regional refining capacity back online just isn't enough, that only removes a month or two of Permian oil production growth off of the market, rest still needs more pipelines
3299 2018-05-24 17:55:24 Do what works for your skin. Gels and foaming cleansers can strip your skin of its natural oil and actually create more breakouts. I've found cream cleansers to be awesome. I like mostly natural stuff mostly like @aveda or even @BurtsBees.

3322 2018-05-24 17:52:34 It is producing white smoke. But Im also aware that leftover sealant and oil residue can cause white smoke for the first few days of driving after replacing head gaskets. So I guess either your right which I hope not, or I'm right which would be a much better outcome. 
3323 2018-05-24 17:52:34 Oil prices hike more during UPA regime
3324 2018-05-24 17:52:24 Yeah, except that's exactly what the state of Alaska does with the oil money and the quality of life for many has gone up. There is a reason why there is a conversation around Basic Universal Income. Try doing some research before you dismiss something out of hand.

Chemist today for anti-histhamine tablets.

I’ve used Tea Tree oil to relieve itching.  Used Vicks Vapour rub to relieve itching, took swelling down too. 
3328 2018-05-24 17:51:53 It only did about 3 times but the first 2 times I kept touching it to much it was like I was rubbing off the product & the 3rd time I didn’t use enough water on my edges beforehand. 

If you add a couple drops of a light oil  to it before you put it your edges it will help.

3342 2018-05-24 17:50:00 They've alienated their European allies and China needs its oil futures in Yuan to be accepted by Iran so they won't budge either. Fact is everything Trump is doing is based on appealing to his core supporters back home. He's already gearing up for reelection

3378 2018-05-24 17:46:56 This coming from a Trump supporter? Lol!!!
3379 2018-05-24 17:46:52 Berman: if oil companies has held a press conference in the 1980s and shared what their scientists found on climate change, Congress would have had hearings. #climateliability
3380 2018-05-24 17:46:52 Putting a few drops of oil helps as well!
3381 2018-05-24 17:46:47 Agreed. A plan based on ridiculously inflated oil prices and a currency arrangement that would remove all the "economic levers".

Two wrongs (#brexit+ Indy) don't make a right.
3382 2018-05-24 17:46:26 noooo
3383 2018-05-24 17:46:19 Ladies. 15 years from now you’re sitting on a beach on an exotic island with a margarita in hand. Your hot, much younger boyfriend is rubbing baby oil on your feet while humming some old school Drake. You grab a fresh strawberry and feed it to him. Trump died years ago.
3384 2018-05-24 17:46:14 been bout it every nigga with me popping like oil or something
3385 2018-05-24 17:46:13 Guly knows the system. Genius move by the oil

3388 2018-05-24 17:45:56 Josef would you be looking at an August bottom in oil? Or would this decline last longer.
3389 2018-05-24 17:45:54 give up je la...bukan masuk pun aku study burn the midnight oil hahahaha
3390 2018-05-24 17:45:51 Baby oil is better 
3391 2018-05-24 17:45:47 Really it is horrifying to face oil prices in India
3392 2018-05-24 17:45:46 A Jew is compared to a lamp.

A lamp is made of a container, a wick, oil, and fire.

First kindle the fire; only then will it shine.

3393 2018-05-24 17:45:35 Your pics come from...lol...D'souza. He loves making fun of the stupid to rub them. All you had to do was look it up.
3394 2018-05-24 17:45:32 Who said supply is less.
If supply is less. Dn crude oil barrel price il b $125
3395 2018-05-24 17:45:22 Marry me daddy
3396 2018-05-24 17:45:14 Id love to rub baby oil all over her, just look at her juicy bum
3397 2018-05-24 17:45:14 I know.  Oil is a bitch.  Too few control it and they turn the taps on and off to manipulate supply and demand as a resulted manipulate the market.  
Same with hydro, using less forces utilities prices to go up to recover the cost of production. 
I do like you. Debate is healthy.
3398 2018-05-24 17:45:13 Rising oil price is a problem for the people not for them because they are collecting a huge amount of revenue .
3399 2018-05-24 17:45:10 / you wanna go trap option then, got any moth traps? if not what about fly paper and fish oil?
3400 2018-05-24 17:44:53 Do you also take a hot shower and end it cold or rub olive oil on your skin?
3401 2018-05-24 17:44:52 Every time you play country music, a droplet of oil forms in the sands of a country the US is thinking of invading
3402 2018-05-24 17:44:47 One more thing talented economist and DUR KE DESHBHKT, oil price is an issue cause it impacts pricing of goods. For once if USD falls below 45 as Modi’s bhakts wanted, your survival as NRI would be tough. Think on these lines
3403 2018-05-24 17:44:37 Leave it up to me to do laundry, car wash, oil change, mail packages, and do some shopping the day before my trip

3406 2018-05-24 17:44:29 
3407 2018-05-24 17:44:28 Very sad... it really a shame for the international community, Iraqi gov, Kurdistan gov US gov and the UN. Because of their interest on shit oil and shit disputed area, these innocent people were displaced from their homes, and now suffering in camps.
3408 2018-05-24 17:44:24 Coconut oil :-)
3409 2018-05-24 17:44:11 All I need now is baby oil rubbed on you
3410 2018-05-24 17:44:08 You know you've found a gem of a place to eat when they not only have about 400 wines, award winning olive oil on the tables, but the owner makes you a hand written list of the best local place to eat within 30km of where you're staying 
3411 2018-05-24 17:44:04 Asparagus salt pepper olive oil put on grill done.
3412 2018-05-24 17:44:03 my brain's just in this jar, floatin around in a suspension of watered down superglue and the gel in fish oil capsules

3415 2018-05-24 17:43:42 Why not bring in the equipment before drilling is done? They already knew they "found oil", and the equipment would be needed. Obviously they are dragging their feet as much as possible
3416 2018-05-24 17:43:41 A breach of US$70/b should start a significant crude oil price decline.
3417 2018-05-24 17:43:33 You're SUPER CLOSE with what we ended up going with!  We're gunna do a really ramped up oil slick that's more focused on blue colors
3418 2018-05-24 17:43:25 We remain bulls on natural gas and recommend investors buy natural gas stocks on weakness. For now hold off more weakness for the sector as crude oil prices decline. We are down 77 cents to US$71.07/b.
3419 2018-05-24 17:43:07 IN 2013 CRUDE OIL 140$ NOW 70$.  YOU ARE SAYING CRUDEOIL PRICE RISING. 6 MONTHS BACK 50$ ONLY.  YOU ARE GIVING WRONG DETAILS TO PEOPLE.
3420 2018-05-24 17:43:01 - anyone know if someone DS like McCain, Clinton, BHO, Sorros, etc has gotten to Kim?  I see China is staging for war against US in Caribbean to free our MIC hold on Venezuela.  Russia sitting there also.  MSM silent on that.  Anyone know UN intent in the area?  US oil interests?

3423 2018-05-24 17:42:47 1- Tblsp peanut butter + 1-Tsp- organic coconut oil.
Mash together with a fork, spoon. Apply to an English muffin.  Enjoy
Or no PB just spread the CO on it.
Unleashes incredible energy. just like everything use with moderation.
3424 2018-05-24 17:42:37 Everyday I’m in Florida I’m eating breakfast on the beach covered in tanning oil drinking mimosas because it’s what I deserve! I just wanna lay on the beach and come back nice and tan 
3425 2018-05-24 17:42:30 bye bye chemicals and hello all natural essential oil cleaning products
3426 2018-05-24 17:42:29 I've been eating a lot of egg whites lately (the kind that come in a carton and you can cook in the microwave just by pouring some in a glass you spray-coat with oil)
3427 2018-05-24 17:42:27 @elonmusk is a snake oil salesman who peddles glorified golf carts and reusable fireworks.
3428 2018-05-24 17:42:25 I need a oil change.
3429 2018-05-24 17:42:25 o.h. somebody saying 'oh we don't believe in sunscreen in our house. we just put on some coconut oil'
a) skin cancer believes in you
b) who can afford to slather themselves in coconut oil on the reg?
3430 2018-05-24 17:42:21 gotta read @MktsInsider more to know what's going on with oil
3431 2018-05-24 17:42:19 That’s why you’ll never be the King of the Medes and the Persians.
3432 2018-05-24 17:42:16 Back up your claim, Comrade Bot.
3433 2018-05-24 17:42:15 Send halo? Are you dead? Or send help? Are you drinking the baby oil?
3434 2018-05-24 17:42:07 Ughhh I gotta leave rn to get an oil change
3435 2018-05-24 17:42:07 Oil
3436 2018-05-24 17:42:03 Oil polishes, cleaners, and furniture oils apply a slippery layer on wood furniture to protect it. However, they do not provide a hard protective layer and leave furniture vulnerable to scratches.
3437 2018-05-24 17:41:57 Lol not at all,kuma an tabo Dan lele ba
3438 2018-05-24 17:41:56 No worries! Just keep an eye on the oil pressure gauge and go from there.
3439 2018-05-24 17:41:49 May Allah protect sister Maryam nd bless her with a spouse who will respect nd appreciate her at all times.
3440 2018-05-24 17:41:49 If any middle class working families think they are winning with Trump go buy gas. He promised Big Oil huge profits and he’s keeping his promise to them for campaign contributions
3441 2018-05-24 17:41:43 @dpradhanbjp consider urself lucky for most of time when crude oil rates where lower or else u would have screwed middle class people with ur incompetency to tackle high rise.
3442 2018-05-24 17:41:41 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
3443 2018-05-24 17:41:38 Can’t believe it’s time to pull out the coconut oil tub already. Skin already drying out.
3444 2018-05-24 17:41:38 I don’t know exactly how it works but I have a dear friend who had brain cancer-she opted for CBD Oil and the one chemo pill a day to try and prevent regrowth. She swears by the CBD!
3445 2018-05-24 17:41:38 I have a hot oil spot on my face that confirms this
3446 2018-05-24 17:41:31 Didn’t you hear? They recently starred in an ad promoting Arabian Oil worth £200m!
3447 2018-05-24 17:41:26 Earlier if oil prices move up or down, inflation follows in the same direction. Now the increase in price of oil boast patriotism. #oilprice #bhaktmukhtbharat #acchedinaaenge #AccheDin
3448 2018-05-24 17:41:23 Tried the oil, deep freezing worked better for me but thanks for reaching out.
3449 2018-05-24 17:41:17 It's sad seeing that the @TheTorontoSun attacking the @OntarioNDP because we are climbing higher in the polls.  Everything from female oil wrestling to not wearing a poppy.  Do they have nothing better to do?  I think @OntarioPCParty are getting desperate and paying the Sun!
3450 2018-05-24 17:41:17 As you say Geoff, the rigs are just anchored  and not working. The ship to ship oil transfer proposal however, is a far more worrying prospect.
3451 2018-05-24 17:41:16 I am just wondering how many Trillions are yet to be discovered missing in Turkana Oil..
#NYSscandal
3452 2018-05-24 17:41:16 Another bad tweet. This is the first administration since the discovery of oil in Nigeria that has put in effort to increase our non-oil revenue base, very significant numbers in the last 2 years. This has been one of their objectives. Help us to improve on the numbers ma'am.
3453 2018-05-24 17:41:12 you express your fondness for me in strange and confusing ways. also -- that's not at all how oil prices are set.
3454 2018-05-24 17:41:03 Avocados and olive oil, I guess...? I had to look up ketogenic. Sounds like visiting home where a burger is served with a side of ribs, and I can't get off the couch for hours.
3455 2018-05-24 17:40:58 Whenever Rahul Gandhi talks of petrol price, ask him - Why did Sonia's UPA leave unpaid bills for the oil Iran supplied?

India had owed $6.4 billion (Rs.41,600,00,00,000) to Iran for crude oil purchase made before Modi came to power. 
Before Modi's 2016 visit, payments started.
3456 2018-05-24 17:40:46 What ur concern ? U can’t buy oil ? U r driving crore rupee car still u have problem with  oil price .. hypocrite
3457 2018-05-24 17:40:42 Thursday May 24th through Saturday May 26th Come see the 13 @GEICORacing Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Showcar in the midway at Lucas Oil Speedway in Wheatland, MO!@lucasspeedway
3458 2018-05-24 17:40:40 In Canada where oil is produced, the price is $1.39 per litre which is close to ₹71. So I don't know where you got this info about ₹31. This is the kind of false information being circulated.
3459 2018-05-24 17:40:33 Decided to tan with coconut oil today... literally baking myself at this point.
3460 2018-05-24 17:40:21 Cannot eastern Canada use Canadian oil? The whole thing is Kafka.
3461 2018-05-24 17:40:21 If you ever see how mi plaster the coconut oil one inna my hair last night and tie down my bun!!!  
AND MI NAH STOP BUY IT EITHER. My hair WILL be laid in my casket.
3462 2018-05-24 17:40:14 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
3463 2018-05-24 17:40:11 This dude from JiffYLube really went smack at money gram girl talking about you need an oil change.
3464 2018-05-24 17:40:10 Isnt that Ferrari engine restricted now? No oil burning anymore..
3465 2018-05-24 17:40:09 I'm not a conspiracy theorist :-) but since Oil is a Cartel & Oil Pricing was used to hit Russia, hence even though Interest Rates were near Zero, but I think for a good amount of time Oil was used as a tool to mop up liquidity from market even when globally growth was subdued.
3466 2018-05-24 17:40:06 Alright I need a baguette and olive oil pronto
3467 2018-05-24 17:40:00 Sadly our 3rd biggest export apart from music and oil
3468 2018-05-24 17:39:57 All the handouts people want lately need to be funded, if Canada stopped selling oil we would be in worse financial trouble than Trudeau has caused.  There is ZERO reason to not activate the 2 BC refineries to refine oil from AB at much better prices.
3469 2018-05-24 17:39:56 I shouldve checked the UV imdex before i decided to lay in the sun with only baby oil on
3470 2018-05-24 17:39:53 Right I got the Shea/castor/olive oil one too it’s not going in the trash
3471 2018-05-24 17:39:42 l'huile / oil
3472 2018-05-24 17:39:41 Hopefully a bigger lead for the @GOP
3473 2018-05-24 17:39:34 Women have the power to lower oil prices. If they all stayed home in the kitchen and stopped driving around to get $120 dollar haircuts, the laws of supply and demand would result in cheaper fuel and less co2!
Disclaimer: I actually like you Nora. Really I do.
3474 2018-05-24 17:39:29 Sub-$3 gas prices are not sustainable for the US oil industry for long periods of time.  $3 is considered a very healthy price point that allows us to be globally competitive and maintain growth/salary increases for our domestic industry.
3475 2018-05-24 17:39:01 I am addicted to tea tree oil
3476 2018-05-24 17:39:00 don’t think you sunburn? go outside with tanning oil. ya will look like a lobster.
3477 2018-05-24 17:38:49 So when I get my oil change what else ya doing for me?
3478 2018-05-24 17:38:46 coconut oil >>

3482 2018-05-24 17:38:27 The pipes are capable of sending crude or dilbit, they aren't dedicated.  BC should NEVER be buying oil from the US when we can buy within Canada.  It is stupid economics.  It is also childish ignorance to deny one of the top income sources for Canada.Selling oil to China is good
3483 2018-05-24 17:38:26 read some where, if oil price would have been the index then Sirya and Iraq have the best place to live.
3484 2018-05-24 17:38:22 Big oil atty says there can't be a common law claim for climate change, would interfere with congressional intent, int'l law. SF and cities say that the co.s' junk science about climate change was intentionally misleading, a nuisance, unreasonable.
3485 2018-05-24 17:38:18 No. In oil and gas, the most plausible outcome of a sophisticated cyber attack against a significant safety system is disaster & casualties.
3486 2018-05-24 17:38:15 Pic or it didn't happen.

3489 2018-05-24 17:37:54 Plaintiff rebuttal: Intentional nuisance: phony science oil companies put out and the promotional activities to mislead consumers. Take that together with oil production and sales, and that’s the basis of our nuisance claim. These go to intent.
3490 2018-05-24 17:37:49 Wtf lol nah we ain’t going that low, but you still gotta make sure your getting everything it’s more than just oil that needs maintenance
3491 2018-05-24 17:37:46 What oil you use cole?
3492 2018-05-24 17:37:42 Dear sir , pl gather more information on how much debt cleared to the oil companies, Also  if the value of tickets gets down it will be a relief for middle class in these prise rise situations,
So  do your bit starting from your field।
Thanks
3493 2018-05-24 17:37:32 On fitness,only oil challenge
3494 2018-05-24 17:37:32 Sure, but if you ignore the science it would seem that there could also be some arguing to simply stick with oil/gas/coal (as we have now).
3495 2018-05-24 17:37:30 Tomato, avocado and olive oil with salt&pepper :D
3496 2018-05-24 17:37:24 Don't bring the oil issue inside the state this z the problem of ur government and short it out soon,

3499 2018-05-24 17:37:11 Do it nothing to lose. Get it for your dad to. Get the RSO oil and supplement for health. Miracle plant.
3500 2018-05-24 17:37:02 Especially fresh asphalt—it’s essentially an oil slick.
3501 2018-05-24 17:36:57 @sldopm @cupakuh bought the July $95s and Sep $100s. This also pseudo hedge for my oil short
3502 2018-05-24 17:36:57 Society will rely on our economy  including oil companies to pay. Now that meaningful action has been delayed for so long we now face major cost for both mitigation and adaptation. This only gets worse until we take proactive action on mitigation.
3503 2018-05-24 17:36:53 Lol, you lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist are the absolute worst.

3506 2018-05-24 17:36:24 Gee, I agree.  We should be looking at peace and standing down with a.l the interference in other countries.  Look at Iraq. Toda.  Look at what that war cost that country.  And for what?  It’s all about the oil!  Trump is unpredictable.
3507 2018-05-24 17:36:18 @narendramodi 
PM only promused oil prices will be under control while cong ruling here. Bring this under GST. High prices will drive away people from BJP. States spoiling BJP name
3508 2018-05-24 17:36:17 Obviously that can, but who will pay the debts which were gained by the UPA and now Iran will supply oil only after clearing that.... However if we middle class don't have issues y u????

3519 2018-05-24 17:35:19 Canada should be a world leader in food production, minerals, fuel oil and wealth but it's holdings are  being squandered by a succession of inept Feds, Inter provincial squabbles and external interference - wake up Canadians it's your country and your future prosperity at stake!
3520 2018-05-24 17:35:18 Post 2014 oil constantly under 80$ in market can't justify price rise but fear of high inflation due to high oil prices as predicted govt. should not waste time bring oil under GST low tax slab to give releef to 70 % of population

It is PM who told prices will be under comtrol while cong ruling here. Now not doing anything. Exorbitantly increased 8 times excise duty. Not acceptable. Bring this under GST. Why oil prices only highly taxed. Local state govr spoiling BJP s name.
3524 2018-05-24 17:34:45 I hate the smell of coconut oil
3525 2018-05-24 17:34:45 Interesting point! Policy can be justified through "overlapping consensus"-people with vastly different values/beliefs agree on a decision, but for different reasons. E.g.: some might favor RE to fight AGW, others to avoid dependence on foreign oil. Then AGW is not an issue.
3526 2018-05-24 17:34:44 I must say, I'm very happy with the results of putting my kebab items into the crockpot with a tiny bit of water instead.  They were tossed w/olive oil, herbs, S&P first, then arranged in groups in crockpot.  Everything steamed & so moist. Delish!
3527 2018-05-24 17:34:38 Started putting straight lavender oil in the diffuser. Game changer.
3528 2018-05-24 17:34:34 Dice up a bunch of veggies (broccoli, red onion, carrots, tomatoes, peppers are what I used the other day!) and the make a dressing with olive oil, garlic, red wine vinegar and salt/pepper to taste. If it’s too acidic, add some sugar or a spoonful of honey!

3539 2018-05-24 17:33:43 In fairness, other Arab nations weren't anxious to "attack" another country to get rid of Saddam, the Taliban, or Ghaddafi. Don't even mention oil either because Afghanistan has absolutely nothing and the billions spent will never be reecoveed. It was the West who fought Hitler.
3540 2018-05-24 17:33:24 As part of the UK Scotland runs a deficit. The exact figure is questionable but also most nations run a deficit except for Norway, Saudi, Abu Dhabi which are all oil producing nations. So if Scotland was indy like other oil nations I’d say we’d have no deficit but a surplus.

3583 2018-05-24 17:28:33 Gas prices went down because opec was trying to put our new shale industry out of business - they inundated the market with underpriced oil.  Obama had as much to do with the low gas prices as a cow in a pasture causing global warming... oh wait.. you believe that too.

Shipping vessels who pollute the ocean with sound (and oil).

... just to name a few.
3585 2018-05-24 17:28:23 That would run counter to the purpose of carbon taxes in the first place. The idea is to make continuing with oil sufficiently painful that replacing with electricity will make sense (but with substantial offsetting cash payments to compensate poorer people who suffer).

3595 2018-05-24 17:27:27 JPM on rising oil prices: "With consumers facing a higher cost of energy equivalent to about 0.3%-pt of GDP and our estimate that energy-related extraction will contribute 0.2%-pt to growth, we think the recent increase in oil prices is a slight negative for the economy on net"
3596 2018-05-24 17:27:20 That shit look like oil 
3597 2018-05-24 17:27:14 I thought the Prez of the US only makes like 300K a year - he must have some good stocks or friends in rich oil based countries.

3601 2018-05-24 17:26:48 And this payment started to accumulate from mid February approx. to 2015 after which the payment channels were opened and now India has to pay that payment in 3 instalments. This is nothing like loan and has no effect on rise in oil prices at all.

3654 2018-05-24 17:22:24 Sir can you please help me out with OIL BONDS issued to OIL Companies by UPA 1 between 2004-2008 when crude oil rises from 20$ to 150$ per barrel but petrol only from Rs36 to Rs 55
3655 2018-05-24 17:22:15 If it's ontop of the valve cover then its residue if its beside or almost under you're leaking, and if its smoking check to make sure you arent know on oil
3656 2018-05-24 17:22:09 Bugs drowning in the oil on my skin szn
3657 2018-05-24 17:21:57 The notion that our soldiers and troops “protect our freedoms” is out dated and comical too me..we could take all boots off th ground and I guarantee America would be A-OK. They protect oil, foreign interests, and government agendas lol not no fuckin freedom it ain’t 1400 anymore
3658 2018-05-24 17:21:43 Yo what did they do with my car. It's been like an hour and a half just for an oil change.
3659 2018-05-24 17:21:35 20? You had I buy your oil or they have I.T already?
3660 2018-05-24 17:21:33 Hard to know how much higher Oil can go - my #RDSB had got quite big and as a Spreadbet it made me even more twitchy. Happy to hold rest though.

3662 2018-05-24 17:21:16 he cannot because oil is muslim in origin and he hates everthing which is muslim.
3663 2018-05-24 17:21:11 Wall them in. Let law abiding folks out. Leave the rest to the felons, and film it. Kind of like Running Man meets Celebrity Death March for gang bangers.
3664 2018-05-24 17:21:08 Add a little soy sauce, sesame oil & rice wine vinegar & it makes a great sauce for noodles as well!
3665 2018-05-24 17:21:08 I pour out my sorrows just like a precious oil, I kiss Your feet, Lord, with a holy joy, my tears an offering of my highest praise! Your eyes say: Welcome, and I receive Your gaze 
3666 2018-05-24 17:21:07 nilagyan kopa kasi ng chili oil eh!! ang ang hangggggg potek di ako nagenjoy
3667 2018-05-24 17:21:04 I feel like my scalp itches like crazy sometimes now that I’ve switched over to using Jamaican Black Castor Oil on it
3668 2018-05-24 17:20:56 A little clove of garlic in llive oil in the ear can help, too.
3669 2018-05-24 17:20:50 I put to much oil 
3670 2018-05-24 17:20:50 STUFF TO BE THANKFUL FOR: argan oil shampoo, red rice soap, coconut oil...
3671 2018-05-24 17:20:38 Synthetic oil I guess is way more expensive. I’m about to start tryna do them hoes by myself for real.
3672 2018-05-24 17:20:32 Put some baby oil on you need a tan
3673 2018-05-24 17:20:27 I use tea tree oil and jojoba. Sometimes a little peppermint for soothing cus it flares up so bad. I will try oiling before and after tomorrow.
3674 2018-05-24 17:20:25 I’m not a body language expert, but everything thing about this man screams fraud, and yet look at all those muppets behind him ready to buy his snake oil. 
3675 2018-05-24 17:20:19 However I’m very oily, yet not acne prone. So my skin is just different. It’s that shiny surface oil. I also use a long wearing matte foundation that still looks perfect all day, even after the gym. My mom is drier and uses the It cosmetics primer and she looks flawless.
3676 2018-05-24 17:20:16 Yeah, right - $47B in tax revenue: based on what kind of fantasy projections ofcrude  oil prices at $150-$200 a barrel over how many years? This is complete nutbar nonsense.
3677 2018-05-24 17:20:15 I understand using oils for hair and skin is a cultural thing, so not everyone does it, but I do enjoy the looks of horror I get from straight/fine-haired people when I talk about how much oil I put on myself. My skin doesn’t produce oils like yours does. I need it!
3678 2018-05-24 17:20:14 That olive oil  wow
3679 2018-05-24 17:20:07 I’ll Rather Be Home Oiled Is Cocoanut Oil In A Big T-Shirt No Panties No Bra Watching Hood Movies Drinking OJ With Dinner Cooking

3681 2018-05-24 17:20:03 Being so woke you cool the planet as it’s recovering from an ice age.
3682 2018-05-24 17:19:58 You think you can blow up #Oil_market, #South_east_Asia, #Europe, #Iran_Deal, #Russia and #World_Trade in the same time?
What they give you to get #High?
3683 2018-05-24 17:19:57 Why do you human skidmarks always spread easily debunkable lies? That's why everybody points out how worthless you are
3684 2018-05-24 17:19:47 If you also look....not a single company that bribed the ANC is on a forfeiture list or charge sheet. SAP, Liebherr, Hitachi, South China Rail, the Nkandla architect, Oil reserves. Not a single person has lost a single cent  because they will all show how they paid the ANC.
3685 2018-05-24 17:19:28 Exactly cause I don’t have no problems with the Argan oil one
3686 2018-05-24 17:19:26 Do they really want 2 pick a fight?!  If they have declared war on America, then I suppose we should go ahead & invade, take it over & set it up as the 51st state.  At least we could use the oil revenues 2 help work on Mexico's problems! Put a bounty on ALL Cartel, Dead or Alive!

3693 2018-05-24 17:18:53 Lmaooo this is why i hate when a lot of the leftist people i follow hate on him, they’re indirectly supporting big oil
3694 2018-05-24 17:18:51 Cheaper gas prices is definitely good for BC.

3705 2018-05-24 17:18:03 How much did those good jobs pay how many people for how long?How much toxic waste and pollution and how many oil spills did those good jobs create?How are all levels of water protected in ND for the future of it’s people?How much do you receive from NRA, Wall Street &Oil H.H.???
3706 2018-05-24 17:18:00 so on that basis - do you think the obesity of the Tongan's comes mainly from the love of imported Mutton Flaps as so often reported or  could it be their love of eating instant pot noodles cooked in seed oil so much they don't even add water,  plus the usual packaged food diet?
3707 2018-05-24 17:17:51 When you go get an oil change and the guy calls and says “well there’s just a few things” you know you’re about to come off a whole check

I follow where love's face leads.

Because oil flows 
to the flame that it feeds.

3713 2018-05-24 17:17:31 the gas tax increase was only 12 cents. This is oil company greed
3714 2018-05-24 17:17:25 Just don't spend that big oil money all in one place, ya hear?
3715 2018-05-24 17:17:25 Exfoliate your face, neck and hands with a mixture of baking soda and olive oil. It is very gentle, and keeps skin very soft and smooth.

3726 2018-05-24 17:16:38 I have psoriasis too! Try oiling your edges before the gel, and again afterwards before you set your edges with a scarf. What kind of oil do you use? I like JBCO :)
3727 2018-05-24 17:16:37 So disheartening to know that such dilapidated learning structures still exist in Nigeria,  let alone  Akwa Ibom, an oil rich state.  Really sad...

3731 2018-05-24 17:16:29 Totally understand why they only do it for electricity customers, but similarly it only makes sense to subsidize heat pumps for oil users. You get the benefit of lower CO2 and lower hydro rates. Similar rebates for baseboard heaters deliver neither of those benefits

3740 2018-05-24 17:14:56 The USA do not care about Venezuelan's oil reserves. They must understand that the USA is number 1 Oil producer. Maduro is naive and does not understand that a former bus driver can not manage the 5th Oil Producer nation. No skills at all.

3742 2018-05-24 17:14:39 it's been a little surprising how smooth of sailing it has been this year for rate shorts & oil longs given how extreme positioning has been in both for most of the year.   one could add $ shorts as well (up until 3-4 weeks ago)

3746 2018-05-24 17:14:22 I don't think there's any huge secret but I like them kinda crispy so I just coat them in a cooking oil, hit it with a (wildcard!) meat rub and then some salt and pepper and cook that mofo up in a skillet.  Do some rolling, let it burn a little if ya like.  Medium heat or higher

3770 2018-05-24 17:11:20 What will the costs be to clean up the environment of the dirty extraction of oil from tar sands? What will it cost when there is no more clean water to process the tar sands let alone to drink?! There is no back up planet!

3773 2018-05-24 17:11:05 True and anyone naive enough to think the oilsands will not one day be consumed is an idiot aka lib-eral ..the US companies have  hired protestors etc to shut it down to raise Oil prices $$$ for their stuff They will scoop ours up after theres is all done.
3774 2018-05-24 17:11:04 On the provenance of the economy's current output growth spurt, the presidency lies each time it attributes this to its "diversification programme"!

Except, of course, this latter scheme has been responsible for boosting oil prices in the global markets.
3775 2018-05-24 17:11:00 It seems like they're related. Destruction of forests for palm oil fields leads to more carbon in the air, more carbon leads to climate change, no?
3776 2018-05-24 17:10:56 Albertans are producers, not manufacturers, they ought to have different needs and problems from Industrially Elite provinces like Ontario and Quebec. Some autonomy vis-à-vis oil industry is must for Alberta "to survive".

3783 2018-05-24 17:10:34 Good to see the Toronto Sun isn’t afraid to tackle the big issues. Today’s front page story addresses something we are all thinking about: have any candidates been involved in “slippery wrestling” (jello, mud or oil) at any level?

Doctor BIL said something about taking fish oil for a couple weeks and something about a pathway and it will mimic the effects of NSAIDs and it’s safe. But of course I forgot to have Ernie get some at the store 
3794 2018-05-24 17:09:48 I had a US Congressman tell me "I love you oil and gas guys... you never ask us for anything other than to be left the Hell alone".

3796 2018-05-24 17:09:43 Agreed. They’re laughing at the fact that we still think Oil is the path forward

3802 2018-05-24 17:08:58 Well my naps need a lil more then h2o and coconut oil  and every product reacts different w different people. what works or is harmful to some might not be for others. And literally all of them can have “potentially” harmful chemicals unless you make your own products.

3815 2018-05-24 17:07:55 Yep, we trained him in Afghanistan, he adds some additional connections and manpower in Zawahiri, and they're off. Iraq 1 was because we didn't think anyone would miss Kuwait. Iraq 2 was a grab for oil, an aircraft carrier in the desert, and a tune up for Iran.

3834 2018-05-24 17:05:48 Where you gullible enough to buy the SNPs own figure of £200 Billion to set up INDY Scotland in 2014, why is £300 Billion utter bullshit & £200 Billion not?  Or the SNPs claim that the oil fund would've start from day one?
3835 2018-05-24 17:05:39 True thats why I’ve only been using oil lately

Bringing value sexy back.
3856 2018-05-24 17:02:50 Perhaps of your foreign policy was a little less hypocritical and even handed and you didn't constantly meddle in the affairs of oil rich nations some nations may be less inclined to hate you?
3857 2018-05-24 17:02:45 That is the advantage of trade. I just wish that Africa would fare better economically. At least Nigeria with its oil should.

3861 2018-05-24 17:02:19 @GeographyNow bit about Kuwait sucks dick. “OIL?” Bitch that actor is hired by you, no body asked any questions. You made that question. To top it of, to start the bit with IRAQ is the cherry on top, do you seek nations pain, little cuts to get views? Never heard of you.

3864 2018-05-24 17:02:05 In the Alchemist you mentioned a prophet who told a story about two spoons with oil, I wonder what these two spoons of oil indicate?
And you wrote that to predict the future, that seer was actually guessing the future by the omens of the present, do you use that technic too?
3865 2018-05-24 17:02:00 Senator Sullivan, the regulations in place before Obama were unsportsmanlike, had no spirit of conservation, and did not protect the economic viability of Alaska. We can not rely on oil forever, but we can diversify with tourism. Tourists come to see bear and wolves.
3866 2018-05-24 17:01:54 Exactly.  But there's little you can do to maintain, say, tie rods. Besides the usual lube jobs that come with the oil change.

Today he has said that it is scandalous that the price of oil is so high.


3879 2018-05-24 17:00:58 He is more concerned about gaining votes for his party, than being more concerned for what is best for the country. A vote for him, is a vote for more Saudi oil and more Canadian Job losses
3880 2018-05-24 17:00:55 Tried to bribe Cody with a donut for him to fit my car in for an oil change. Turns out he doesn’t want a donut, I still get my oil changed and I get to eat it

3888 2018-05-24 17:00:18 ARE CHEAP OIL CHANGES GOOD FOR THE CAR?

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference.

But INDIRECT costs of fossil fuel is never paid. Shouldn't oil companies pay for carbon recapture?
3897 2018-05-24 16:59:20 I think a lot of our country’s hostility to Palestine (beyond racism and our maniacal obsession with oil) stems from the fact that for a long time Americans didn’t actually have a concept of an occupying force steadily encroaching on our freedom

3900 2018-05-24 16:59:00 According to the Burnaby School District, the school was built in 1986. The Tank Farm was built to receive oil when the pipeline opened in 1953. Apparently facts and research is not your strong suit.

3921 2018-05-24 16:57:01 The Opec average is about USD 76.5 and the Brent average is about USD 79 so the price of our oil mix isn't out of line. There are costs of moving crude oil to refineries, and of breaking it into usable fuels like petrol. Taxes etc apply after that's done, varying by state
3922 2018-05-24 16:57:00 some girl posted one of her paintings  on instagram & it looks IDENTICAL to my mans & now I’m wondering why she’s dreaming about him enough to paint him WELL on an oil canvas
3923 2018-05-24 16:57:00 Everyone but Chevron is making the “we’re just a holding company” argument, pushing to dismiss case for lack of personal jurisdiction. ConocoPhillips says you can’t sue oil companies for specific nuisance or damages anywhere. #climateliability
3924 2018-05-24 16:56:56 Today's crude oil international rate is $71 per barrel. One dollars = ₹69 today's rate. One barrel = 119 lts.  71×69 =₹4899 . So per litre oil cost is ₹4899÷119=₹41.2
Today's petrol price in india ₹84 than these ₹ 42.8 is gov.taxes

3926 2018-05-24 16:56:42 I am a great car mom. Leonard just got a new battery, an oil change, and two new filters. It was only $300 but it’s fine, everything is fine. #adulting
3927 2018-05-24 16:56:30 You know, at some point I was expecting PDP to fill the media with talk about how the price of oil is going up because God is happy with Nigerians considering removing APC and Buhari from office.
3928 2018-05-24 16:56:29 Nah I only mix for my dreads coconut oil scraight for my skin though
3929 2018-05-24 16:56:22 I'm certainly not going to be caught with low oil , that's for sure !

3936 2018-05-24 16:55:32 Everyone tells me my hair looks great and when I tell them it’s coconut oil they still spend a 1000 bucks on hair salon and shit.
3937 2018-05-24 16:55:32 @HarleyRouda You are accused of not being a champion of the environment by Think Progress due to your investments in crude oil. Harley you really should answer this charge. What about this crude oil?
3938 2018-05-24 16:55:31 When crude oil prices were $110 a barrel during UPA 2, petrol prices were Rs 71/litre. When #Modi Sarkar took ever, crude oil was at $40 a barrel, but instead of passing the benefit onto the consumer, the #BJP raised excise tax by 380%.

3943 2018-05-24 16:55:16 Exactly my point. If they are not budging, what good is it tinker with fuel & oil, jeopardizing future court cases, digging in their heels & ending any negotiations in the last week? High gas prices & chaos at YVR will turn everyone in BC against us. They will just buy elsewhere

जो बुद्दिजीवी Crude Oil का रेट बताते फिर रहे है, वो इस लोन के बारे में चुप्पी साधे बैठे है

ये दोगलापन क्यों??
3945 2018-05-24 16:55:01 Not 2 even mention the US raping of their natural resources (i.e. oil). That was & IS the ONLY reason they're over there. Get a clue dude!
3946 2018-05-24 16:55:01 Pangbobo or for dds listening benefit lang yung kuda na Japan is better off than PH dahil ang problema raw wala tayong oil. Hey!! Walang oil ang Japan! Ang problema why they're better off is wala silang presidente na katulad niya. That's the simplest explanation
3947 2018-05-24 16:55:00 That debt is what we are paying today, but with oil down, PDVSA destroyed and hyperinflation accumulated all together. There are many other causes you can look at by studying our history.We have always been since the previous dictator a left-wing country not communist but of left

3963 2018-05-24 16:54:07 Who wants to change the oil in my car? 
3964 2018-05-24 16:54:02 Yes. We troglodytes in Rupert's Land are getting tired of the Liberals' generational rape of the oil industry.

Just knowing that the moment we accrue too much wealth and political power will result in the culling of "the tall poppy of Confederation" makes me want to be American.
3965 2018-05-24 16:54:00 If any company brags about burning the midnight oil for a project – beware. They’ve accidentally worked themselves back in time to 1846, when people were still using whale oil for lighting purposes.
3966 2018-05-24 16:53:57 If I were President, journalists would be even more exhausted... because they'd all be working in uranium mines north of the Arctic Circle.
3967 2018-05-24 16:53:54 The stuff in the jar is watery, but the lotion i use comes in a bottle and feels like there’s more oil in it or like some type of hydrator
3968 2018-05-24 16:53:43 We all know, actual price of petrol is not more than 32 rupees per litre then too a common man has to pay more than 80 rupees per litres adding central and state taxes and cess.
@narendramodi @rajnathsingh
Can the govt. Plz explain why can't  Gst be levied in crude oil too.
3969 2018-05-24 16:53:42 Yea, that's too thick. Won't hurt them mechanically (although it does ramp up the load on the oil pump), just takes the edge off them on a lot of fronts. Always seems to be this tendency to go for thick oil 'because it's a classic engine'. Not what went in 'em when new!
3970 2018-05-24 16:53:39 Lmao thank you past amanda for purchasing two extra oil changes bc before they check they said it was gonna be $50 and I almost grabbed my keys back
3971 2018-05-24 16:53:25 Considering that the price of oil is largely beyond the influence of the govt but exchange rates and taxation are not, this is more a revolt against high taxes and poor management of the economy than a strike.
3972 2018-05-24 16:53:25 
3973 2018-05-24 16:53:21 If you say so. They've been fracking in ND since 2006, and it has to do more with the ND govt than it does with Trump. Peak output was 2012 and looks to meet that this year if oil prices stay up.
3974 2018-05-24 16:53:18 Crood oil ka byora bhi de diya hota
3975 2018-05-24 16:53:15 Yes it’s good for hot oil treatments and just for a moisturizer I get it from Target idk of beauty supplies have it and I love castor oil, I used to use q tips to put it on my eyebrows and they had got hella thick.
3976 2018-05-24 16:53:11 Portugal is great... except the food, it feels like the Netherlands with olive oil
3977 2018-05-24 16:53:07 I’m getting up sold like a sucker at this oil change. Full synthetic oil? of course. New air filter? Sure. Engine cleaner? Why not. New cabin filter? Ew, yeah let’s get a new one in there.
3978 2018-05-24 16:52:53 I saw your video on YouTube, and you might be right about socialism was not the cause of this mess. It was not Oil war either. During the period where oil price was over 100usd, Chavez gift oil and money to Caribbean nations, to Latin neighbors. And accumulated a huge debt...
3979 2018-05-24 16:52:51 We have all heard this before, do you remember Cheney saying a war in Iraq will cost America nothing because Iraq has all that oil?
3980 2018-05-24 16:52:50 I’m just tryna rub oil on ass.

3982 2018-05-24 16:52:47 You don’t feel the cantu is super watery? Maybe I’ll try what I have now and use oil as a “sealant”

Bring the price of oil to GST.
3996 2018-05-24 16:51:51 Farhan the Rs 31/litre is the cost of landed crude oil - not petrol - which for the kind that India buys is about USD 77.2/barrel (at about 65 INR per USD). That oil needs to be broken down into petrol in refineries to be used as fuel. In June 2017 a barrel cost us 44 USD.
3997 2018-05-24 16:51:50 Lmao I just hate coconut oil it makes my hair and skin feel dryer than it originally was. It works for some people though I just can't do it. And argan oil and tea tree is bomb af
3998 2018-05-24 16:51:50 We are coming back strong they said but no one is talking about the kind of leaders we have. Of all the coastal land and the fertile land not mentioning the oil vested land Allah has given us, its unfortunate to say Somalis are fighting over abarren Land; Takuraq? So sad

4000 2018-05-24 16:51:45 Derogar los contratos con Tullw Oil para la exploración de petróleo en  las costas del norte del país, en momentos que lo requerimos y no hay inversiones genera dudas, a sabiendas, que esa  Cía. es experta en trabajos en este medio, peor, si hubo presión de los pescadores.
4001 2018-05-24 16:51:40 Lmao i also seal it with oil so its not crunchy. The cantu i can use by itself and its fine
4002 2018-05-24 16:51:34 which I honestly don't think I could ever do. keeping the oil in my mouth for 20min without swallowing makes my stomach churn just thinking about it @_@

4005 2018-05-24 16:51:21 I’m trying to smell like coconut oil & natural hair care products every day !
4006 2018-05-24 16:51:21 That's my understanding as it is their major export (besides spycraft). When oil is low they lose - when it goes up they win. The petroleum industry is their largest and their economy depends on it.
4007 2018-05-24 16:51:07 what even is skincare does the oil getting on my face when i eat salad count
4008 2018-05-24 16:51:07 I've noticed a lot of you aren't rotating your tires enough.  You really want to get the best mileage out of them. Pep Boys will do it for free with an oil change.  #codiisyourdadnow
4009 2018-05-24 16:51:05 My primary concern with offshore seismic surveys doesn’t have anything to do with unexploded ordinance. I just wonder why it’s necessary to invest in additional oil based energy power before exploring the potential of renewables for our state.
4010 2018-05-24 16:50:56 oh okay I see! so you're taking it to give you an energy boost during the day? that's rly something I haven't heard of before, but then again it's not like I can claim I ever researched coconut oil enough to know all its health benefits  I just know ppl use it for oil pulling
4011 2018-05-24 16:50:54 I just want to get the baby oil out and fuck those big tits

4021 2018-05-24 16:50:08 Rebates are thru the energy provider. Offered for $$ reasons - cheaper to assist customer than to continue to build up the infrastructure to produce the resource. Oil heat companies would need to provide rebates.
4022 2018-05-24 16:50:00 This is a good example of what socialism AND a dictator can do to a country
Lets take a look at Venezuela, a country that once flourished economically with it's large oil supply
GDP has fallen double digits each of the last 2 years
Inflation has hit 2400%
Tell that to socialists
4023 2018-05-24 16:49:59 I wonder if it was worth for their business passing along to brazilian consumers the hike on oil prices plus 13% less on stocks value instead of doing it smoothly and slowly...
4024 2018-05-24 16:49:43 You are not paying attention. Andrew Silson has told us that oil was NOT a bonus in 2014 and that it was ‘baked into’ the White Paper - it was essential to it as a prospectus. Do you disbelieve your own leaders now?
4025 2018-05-24 16:49:42 Well said. 
The world is beautiful but like 80% of it's humans are just an oil slick of disappointment. 
Thank you for everything you have been forced to do, you are changing the world for the better in so many ways

4027 2018-05-24 16:49:34 Same!! I love olive oil and another one of my favorites is castor oil. I have to look into the all purpose herbal oil though

4043 2018-05-24 16:48:22 People really be payin $50 for an oil change? 
4044 2018-05-24 16:47:51 I will have to try magnesium oil! #luxtravelchat
4045 2018-05-24 16:47:48 Any good oil will stand it in good stead, though – but don't go excessively heavy, like 20W50. Unnecessarily thick and simply harms performance, consumption and response. These things oil through the pushrods, so they need oil that flows easily...
4046 2018-05-24 16:47:41 Plus change of oil and oil filter 
4047 2018-05-24 16:47:30 Yh by using all that oil money 
4048 2018-05-24 16:47:16 Took the day to get Ethel’s tires rotated and re-pressured, she’s getting an oil change and a car wash. Love you bb 
4049 2018-05-24 16:47:16 Ooh great -  was just this minute talking to someone about a project with British rapeseed oil - have a bunch of the vinegars already and love them

Coat myself in coconut oil 
Lay out in the sun until i become a dark chocolate GAWD
4053 2018-05-24 16:46:49 The Oil crisis is something like apne paer pe kulhadi. Govt has neither ever cared to explain to the country nor has it ever showed reasonableness. Stoic silence never gives answer to people. Global prices never guided domestic prices hence the disappointed population. Even today
4054 2018-05-24 16:46:46 I can give you a link for the oil
4055 2018-05-24 16:46:35 “Boy Howdy” Kasich is just better at selling with a smile the same Goldwater-Nixon-Reagan snake oil that invited Trumpism.
4056 2018-05-24 16:46:25 Magnesium Oil? Going to have to try!
4057 2018-05-24 16:46:23 Midnight Oil - Comfortable Place On The Couch
4058 2018-05-24 16:46:23 It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanism of friendship.
4059 2018-05-24 16:46:20 Yeah but when you’re as dumb as that chick was she prob causes herself a lot of stress lol. She’s prob 25 and looks 50 
4060 2018-05-24 16:46:20 Bout to get my new tires put on and an oil change! Might as well go ahead and get Penelope washed too
4061 2018-05-24 16:46:17 Dates are the best!

I like to remove the pit, add a slice of manchego cheese, slice of celery, dash of celery salt and dribble of olive oil
4062 2018-05-24 16:46:07 now that i know i got all of next week off i’m regretting scheduling my car for an oil change at 8AM. 
4063 2018-05-24 16:45:56 There's a sinkhole on The left side of the front lawn,  probably caused by fracking, oil and natural gas. Better block that off,  not as if he strolls the grounds
4064 2018-05-24 16:45:46 Mix 3 pints cherry with 2 cups grits. Add Olive Oil. Squeeze out excess liquid Serve on bread
4065 2018-05-24 16:45:45 A3 Received a small bottle of lavender oil on a Croatian cruise years ago. Now I travel with it and sprinkle some on my pillow. Hotel in Glasgow gave a spray and temple scent roller too. Loved it!  #luxtravelchat
4066 2018-05-24 16:45:44 I need to go get a oil change
4067 2018-05-24 16:45:42 Ibang level yung oil sa mukha ko ngayon tbh

4070 2018-05-24 16:45:26 Apologies for the delayed response and aggressive glue dots. A very frustrating experience! Medium tack glue dots were incorrectly used on 950 labels recently. A few drops of cooking oil rubbed on the dot will allow the dot to literally slide off the baking surface. #lowtackdots
4071 2018-05-24 16:45:09 It's OBJ that ridiculed himself. 

The most dangerous person to fight is one that has nothing to lose. 

@MBuhari doesn't have.... 

Oil well
Foreign Accounts 
DISCO
Private University 
Refinery outside the country 

OBJ has all this, hence he has all to lose.
4072 2018-05-24 16:45:09 How about gas prices Mr president. I was hoping you would not forget the people that elected you. Big oil companies win again.
4073 2018-05-24 16:45:08 GP It's different because Williamson's white. See?
4074 2018-05-24 16:45:08 Eles estão dispostos a defender a fragmentação da Petrobras (dica: pesquise o caso Standard Oil)? Se não, eles são parte do problema, não da solução.
4075 2018-05-24 16:45:07 Hi bill.  An athlete like you have the right to free speech.  However you do not have that right at work.  Already been ruled on.  If you worked for Exxon you could not protest big oil at work.  You can on your own time.
4076 2018-05-24 16:45:07 i just suntanned in a garden for an hour not realizing the bug spray i was using was fucking. oil based. i could have fucking like... cooked myself gjdnfkdjfjdk
4077 2018-05-24 16:45:06 l got an oil change, new windshield wipers and washed & vacuumed out my car and then l got in a freaking car accident lmao just my luck
4078 2018-05-24 16:44:57 I swear my life moves organically.  I was looking for a chiropractor for years & never went. I happened to install this office services. He had stones, hamsa, geodes & dream catchers all around. I knew it would be a great fit. He uses CBD oil as well. 
4079 2018-05-24 16:44:55 Lol hell nah. I just don’t think these 2 go together, like water & oil
4080 2018-05-24 16:44:52 Now Ecostyler gonna kill us? Lol

4082 2018-05-24 16:44:30 I would not export our precious oil and gas reserves to potential future military enemy China. Better to sell out massive coal reserves.
4083 2018-05-24 16:44:29 I love having a car until it’s time to get your brakes fixed, replace all 4 tires, oil change etc.
4084 2018-05-24 16:44:20 A3 I stopped having meds in March and had the most amazing 2 months sleeping without. I now swear by magnesium oil (which really helps). And scents - but is this all physiological? #luxtravelchat
4085 2018-05-24 16:44:15 Damn 54 what ?? .. oil of Olay ?? .. what what .. 
4086 2018-05-24 16:44:15 Zzzzzzz
4087 2018-05-24 16:44:11 I put a Clean & clear spot treatment after I put tea tree oil and a witch hazel on my face. 
Dawg all my pimples are flat. 
They noticeable with out makeup but DEAD ASS I WOKE UP AND THEY FLAT.
4088 2018-05-24 16:44:01 Yeah I feel you it is really thin and it don’t really work on my skin either I use all purpose herbal oil for my skin and my hair I use tea tree oil and olive oil .
4089 2018-05-24 16:43:51 Smashbox has a primer oil that I live for in the winter. Amazing. A little goes a long way.

4092 2018-05-24 16:43:26 A3. Get a @mujiusa essential oil diffuser, and some lavender essential oils. More than just the soothing scent the vapour makes a relaxing white noise that is a welcome distraction from any snoring. And also your room will smell like a spa. #luxtravelchat
4093 2018-05-24 16:43:19 Oil be blowed!
4094 2018-05-24 16:43:18 When Oil was at $130/barrel then also we paid 75 rs and not rs 100.. somethings should be better left to policy makers obviously with trust..
4095 2018-05-24 16:43:16 I don’t even use it anymore. It’s just been sitting under the sink. Water and coconut oil is all that’s really in my hair routine. My hair started to feel funny so I just stopped using errthang
4096 2018-05-24 16:43:11 I’ll second that. How did the real PBR let this happen? Their delicious beer tainted by motor oil.
4097 2018-05-24 16:43:09 And how is liquor van even closely related to Oil price or for that matter drought?
4098 2018-05-24 16:43:06 What is the use of roads when petrol prices are soaring at an infinite rate even when the crude oil prices are very low?
People can't afford petrol at 100 rupees/litre.
Its a shame that people who taunted MMS for failed governance on petrol prices has failed to deliver miserably
4099 2018-05-24 16:43:03 My parents took my car to get an oil change 
4100 2018-05-24 16:42:59 Excellent point in fact as it turns out Canada is our largest supplier of crude oil. Seems we have hydraulic fracturing to thank for regaining our oil independence. You know that thing the Democrats wanted to ban & or restrict. Good thing for President Trump eh?
4101 2018-05-24 16:42:58 Life tip instead of using vinegar on a sunburn use coconut oil

4104 2018-05-24 16:42:40 Last night preparing for a dinner party, I opened a bottle of what I thought was essential oil and accidentally sniffed poppers. #notmyhouse
4105 2018-05-24 16:42:38 Not only that - India has agreed to pay Iran an interest of 1.5 per cent on $6.5-billion that refiners like Essar Oil and Mangalore Refinery (MRPL) owe it in oil dues, as a 'goodwill gesture'.
4106 2018-05-24 16:42:35 Almond oil>coconut oil
4107 2018-05-24 16:42:33 So my day of “me time” got ruined, facemask isn’t on and hair oil isn’t in. BUT- I got coffee convos to keep me going. God bless @KailLowry and @LindsieChrisley 
4108 2018-05-24 16:42:32 refineries uses future contracts in order to hedge their risks against rise in oil price.
4109 2018-05-24 16:42:31 I challenge neither of you #RahulGandhi and #narendramodi would bring permanent solution for the Oil price hike. It's just an act to make people fools.
4110 2018-05-24 16:42:21 When we have ppl like Shirfuddin everyone will lecture India Sherfu be clear Inxia will not accept any terrorists or their sympthasiers even when they are fried in burning oil ...let them belong to any faith

4112 2018-05-24 16:42:14 He has always been a con man, literally lied to Forbes, to get on the Forbes 400 list. He’s a serial Sexual assaulter, adulterer, he’s intentionally having the EPA dismantled, in order to maximize profit for his big oil buddies, loosening financial regulations that were set in
4113 2018-05-24 16:42:09 You are funny. 

Go on then. Tell me how getting forced to stop selling opium to the Chinese was really an act of kindness. Or how the U.K. stopped stealing Iranian oil as an act of generosity. 
4114 2018-05-24 16:42:04 What most crazy lefties won’t admit, or worse, fail to understand is that the last century of oil has been the greatest social economic leveler in the long history of humanity. The eco warriors are being used by the globalists to impoverish the world.
4115 2018-05-24 16:42:00 Use heart healthy cooking oils such as olive oil, canola oil or mustard oil. Avoid sunflower oil, safflower oil, ghee, butter, margaraine.
4116 2018-05-24 16:41:52 He doesn't think he himself hasn't caused lasting damage - the munchausen by proxy party running on an economy they juiced and the average person will have nothing after paying for GAS and Home Heating Oil. I refuse to give anyone credit for my company doing well. I am Awesome 
4117 2018-05-24 16:41:50 Sarswat..  Konsa karza tha iran ka..  Whatsapp university mat pela karo har jagah..  Did indian govt purchased oil from iran.. NO.  Oil company purchased from iran and sold it to us. Its the company responsibility to pay it to iran not any indian govt responsibility
4118 2018-05-24 16:41:49 Imagine what would have happened if the Trooper did not have the body-cam. His life would have been destroyed.  She should def go to prison for a very long time. Make an example out of her.
4119 2018-05-24 16:41:49 Oh and olive oil!

Can you tell me one thing? Why your govt has stopped subcidy in fuel? And now the PSU's are increasing the fuel price as per crude oil price.I think you might be knowing the current margin of psu's?Can you please ask state government also to reduce some taxes?
4126 2018-05-24 16:41:04 It's too bad that this woman is stealing money from parents who have kids that are autistic ..they need the money for things that are going to work ..not this snake oil salesman

4129 2018-05-24 16:40:39 . Thanks for the laugh I needed one today after hearing about NK!
4130 2018-05-24 16:40:36 India does not pay Iran’s oil because there was no way to pay them.

There are multiple factors here that we need to take into account. I have listed them in the bullets points below.

There were several sanctions on Iran. Please see Sanctions against Iran to get the completeList
4131 2018-05-24 16:40:36 Finally doing my oil change this weekend lol

4135 2018-05-24 16:40:23 Lol thanks Supreme Court! Looking forward to their distinguishing how restrictions on beer imports is ancillary but restrictions on oil imports is not.
4136 2018-05-24 16:40:21 I’m waiting while my oil gets changed and there’s this old couple sitting together talking about their skin aging and always having stuffy hears and it’s just :’) I’m crying they’re so cute. They call each other babe and darling and make each other laugh
4137 2018-05-24 16:40:21 Twitter is so funny today I spilled my Tea all over before i even made it, and then I spilled all the beverages in the fridge, followed by spilling my dreams all over my reality, and then finally Exxon Mobile spilled oil into the ocean.

4139 2018-05-24 16:40:03 How much of the Republican #taxplan annual saving per family of 4 w 2 cars was eaten up by Trump's Iran deal pullout, causing a huge spike in oil prices leading to $4.50 gas prices, as crude heads to $100/b
4140 2018-05-24 16:40:00 I know, I keep saying they would rather see the country burn to the ground than help Trump fix it. I didn’t like libs before now I really dislike them. I wonder also if NK would have been a little more scared if we were united. Those freaking AHs.  No chance for peace
4141 2018-05-24 16:39:47 Honestly what's your beef with PMB? Am praying for the increase in oil price so we could afford to fix the roads,  provide electricity,  health and provide employment for the youths.
4142 2018-05-24 16:39:42 Lembrando que isso é crude oil, Elle não é refinado que já dá um valor agregado

4151 2018-05-24 16:38:42 oil production in rural areas, you have to have people in the office in Houston. They are very important to producing oil wealth.  2. Cities form in places that create wealth and lots of it in high density.

4153 2018-05-24 16:38:23 What a great fool! This govt is selling petrol at double price and deprived you the benefit of low oil price. Are you ready to be looted by this govt?.

4163 2018-05-24 16:37:34 @narendramodi 
Hi dear sir
Oil price is massive hike under ur administration,while congress were ruling time you tweeted as its failure of Manmohan Singh administration. Nowadays oil price is so higher than early price.Can we think like this is a failure of your administration?
4164 2018-05-24 16:37:28 Summary: keep pumping oil until the well dry, then increase prices.
4165 2018-05-24 16:37:27 Take even more with the other! He’s a lying conniving conman... a century ago he’d be selling snake oil

4168 2018-05-24 16:37:11 SARB believes crude oil prices will stabilise around $70/barrel. Oh, and no interest rate reductions for the rest of the year  zero relief guys!
4169 2018-05-24 16:37:04 Whats wrong with #Fracking? ;)
If crude oil is around $55 a barrel then Fracking is extremely non-profitable (oil is ALWAYS unprofitable, its just heavily taxpayer subsidized) so luckily for them some orange baboon has set fire to the #MiddleEast again helping it spike to $80+..
4170 2018-05-24 16:36:59 whenever you go get your oil changed they’re always a million things wrong with your car
4171 2018-05-24 16:36:36 I know they would rather see the country burn to the ground before letting Trump do good. I wonder if NK would have been more fearful of us if we had a more united country. These AHs, they need to hell. When O was in I didn’t hope he would fail, I hoped I was wrong about him.
4172 2018-05-24 16:36:36 Without a doubt, this is the best President (and Congress) money can buy. Just ask the Russians, Ukrainians, Banks, Oil, NRA, etc.

4175 2018-05-24 16:36:03 Think of it like this, If the worst you endure these days is an oil leak you are doing quite well. Besides, it gives you another good reason to get your hands dirty working on your large metal children. 
4176 2018-05-24 16:35:58 Start using CBD oil! Take some before you go to bed and it helps you sleep well and wake up invigorated! You’ll love it. Plus it’s great for a whole bunch of other stuff like anxiety and pain. 
4177 2018-05-24 16:35:57 Imagine if someone like physically couldn’t switch from missionary to doggy though. Like how white people cant dance and water and oil can’t mix
4178 2018-05-24 16:35:55 Eco styler got me questioning my coconut oil
4179 2018-05-24 16:35:51 yung oil blend ko na pampatulog, tinira ko na talaga coz i REALLY need to sleep. ayon. parang nasinghot ko yung buong bote sa excitement ko, parang na-reverse ang effect hahaha!

I challenge pappu, decrease oil price in Karnataka 
4185 2018-05-24 16:35:07 I eat that stuff at least three times a week! Add a glug of olive oil, plus some salt, pepper and parmesan and you've made dinner in the time it takes to make a cup of tea!
4186 2018-05-24 16:35:05 Is my blonde friend.....leaking oil did he DIE???? His bf gonna wake and game over man, game over 
4187 2018-05-24 16:35:01 .@WYeates is making the activist argument, where these kinds of investments by Big Oil are viewed through a political lens rather than as a change in business strategy in response to the Energy Transition. Unfortunately for Will the evidence is overwhelming it isn't greenwashing.
4188 2018-05-24 16:34:48 I already have to buy 6 new tires... parts oil change, alignments... shit nah lol get this shit out my yard
4189 2018-05-24 16:34:48 Jeff from F F Hitchcock Oil did a great job fixing my hot water heater. Nice guy even put up with my overly friendly 90 pound Lab!

4196 2018-05-24 16:34:10 Was about time this huckster and snake oil sales man got his due.
4197 2018-05-24 16:34:08 @SecretaryZinke 

Ryan Zinke,

America people do NOT want to partner with big oil.

You are a sell out and we see you!

You are a fraud.
4198 2018-05-24 16:34:08 Girl have you heard of an oil rinse? Aussie to detangle
Oil as the pre-poo
Then wash as usual?
4199 2018-05-24 16:33:44 @realDonaldTrump Get off of your ass and stop these Texas oil terrorists from wrecking the economy. You are suppose to be protecting the country, and yet this is a national security issue, you aren’t living up to the oath you took to become president.
4200 2018-05-24 16:33:41 @MSNBC The oil prices go down, and the gas prices go up? Who's watching the price fixing by big oil; the republicans?  Trump and his staff want to go to war with N Korea; they R prepared to send our troops into battle, where they will pick up their weapons and lead the charge.
4201 2018-05-24 16:33:39 Did we find out how old she is, I figured just young and dumb...

4204 2018-05-24 16:33:30 My husband always sticks with unrefined coconut oil and extra virgin olive oil. He's a really good chef.
4205 2018-05-24 16:33:17 The rubber tires on your bike were made using oil, the oil being shipped to BC is by train, how is that more environmentally friendly, a pipe underground is much cleaner and safer just like natural gas.

4207 2018-05-24 16:32:57 today’s scent giving you lavender, cocoa butter, and jojoba oil vibes 
4208 2018-05-24 16:32:45 This is my nightly routine!!
-Take off all makeup/dirt using micellar water
- Clean pores w/witch hazel
-Moisturize
-Wait for that to sink in, use Bio Oil on any scars 

I have minor breakouts and bad scars but that's it so this actually works for me!!
4209 2018-05-24 16:32:42 If being American means mindlessly worshipping a flag and a military that does the bidding of oil companies and defense contractors, then I guess I won't be American .
4210 2018-05-24 16:32:33 I seriously doubt I am the one misinformed or blind. And do you think gas prices are the same in all states? What you should be researching is the price of oil per barrel to get your facts straight. Google is your best friend. I am well educated.
4211 2018-05-24 16:32:33 You guys are hysterical 
4212 2018-05-24 16:32:30 Congress took Oil of $8 billion from Iran without paying them a penny due US sanction... But Modi Govt. is paying all those Oil dues of Congress.... How oil price will go down tell....
4213 2018-05-24 16:32:28 Since you have experience of reducing it in past
Stop mocking with the sentiment of lndian public.Pricing of petrol linked with crude oil has done by yours
4214 2018-05-24 16:32:26 Sometimes I think Nigeria could have been better off without oil. We had a strong economy before the discovery of oil.
4215 2018-05-24 16:32:19 Sometimes I use olive oil, also
4216 2018-05-24 16:32:18 My little 21 dollar oil diffuser is hands down the best Amazon purchase I’ve made to date.
4217 2018-05-24 16:32:16 Brent Crude Oil Price Falters at $80, Downside Back In Focus
From both fundamental and technical viewpoints, the price of the global crude oil benchmark is looking toppis...
4218 2018-05-24 16:32:14 How about the oil prices Mr. President. This way out of control.
4219 2018-05-24 16:32:07 I wonder if anyone has the courage to make this deal a campaign issue. Oil and Gas can have any pipeline they like but are on the hook for 100% of climate adaptation and mitigation costs... even if it bankrupts them. Good deal right?  #OntarioElection2018
4220 2018-05-24 16:32:06 @East_Riding @Humberbeat a Massive oil spill from a lorry from top of Swinemoor lane Beverley all the way down.
4221 2018-05-24 16:32:03 Absolutely!!!  Russia and Saudi Arabia need oil prices to go up!  Oligarchs and oil companies invested heavily in oil funded by illegal loans/banking.  Unrest in M.E., Syria, etc. helps increase prices and returns on their investments.  Loans are due soon.
4222 2018-05-24 16:32:03 If you compare the average increase in price of petrol during past and present govt per yr it turns out much much less as compared to previous govt any how it is all because of sanctions imposed  by USA on IRAN , they can not sell the oil to any body,,
4223 2018-05-24 16:31:56 Depends which problem you’re trying to solve. At $100 a tonne it adds about 30 cents a litre. Electricity will still be 40% more expensive to heat your home through baseboard. Heat pump is then only a little cheaper operating than oil and has big capital cost
4224 2018-05-24 16:31:52 Na now I knw say cookn is not that easy, imagine how this oil burn burn my hands in the space of some seconds...... Mata sannunku!!
4225 2018-05-24 16:31:44 can i jus say castor oil works but it hurts my eye!

4230 2018-05-24 16:31:24 I saw on TV that a child was prescribed the oil which stopped the child fitting. Nice have just stopped it. Typical Britain.
4231 2018-05-24 16:31:24 lemme tell y'all.. if you like garlic, cooking with garlic oil is a game changer
4232 2018-05-24 16:31:10 the four day old argan oil container of it in my bathroom cabinet begs to differ
4233 2018-05-24 16:30:58 While it sounds reasonable, with some notable exceptions, that's not how journalism works, at least not for national print outlets. There are many negative articles about fracking, oil spills, car safety issues (see Toyota), bankruptcies, bailouts, pollution, recalls, etc.
4234 2018-05-24 16:30:57 Name one oil subsidy.
4235 2018-05-24 16:30:56 But if they were oil or gun lobbyists, the red carpet would be rolled out. Would it kill a Representative or their staffer to meet with a citizen? That IS THEIR JOB.

4239 2018-05-24 16:30:40 He thinks this is a like real estate deal where the other side will break and beg him to come back to the table. Not even joking.

4251 2018-05-24 16:29:49 And for fecks sake don't hype it all up and pin it all on oil. 

Its about the Scots as people, the resources, the knowledge, the expertise. 

Our aim is for constitutional normality in a democratic country and not be run by our larger neighbour.
4252 2018-05-24 16:29:40 so I’m outside in the sun for once in my life and I put tanning oil on, I can smell my skin cooking, is this normal?
4253 2018-05-24 16:29:39 There was something in my eye. Motor oil spray. From fixing cars and lifting around the heavy parts of cars like the ....fule pipes and furnace
4254 2018-05-24 16:29:29 All what OBJ needs to bring down PMB is to give the addresses & details of PMB's assets like oil wells, landed property, estates in Nigeria & abroad

4256 2018-05-24 16:29:21 This morning's #selfcare looked like: meditation, cathartic crying, naked time, a walk around the park, petting a happy dog, a cleansing shower, coconut oil, and refilling my medicine calendar.
4257 2018-05-24 16:29:03 I sincerely don’t get this. Is this a type of redacted joke?
4258 2018-05-24 16:28:56 I got gas this morning.  Found a station where I was 2nd in line. Most look like USA in the 70s during the Oil Crisis.  #Bike
4259 2018-05-24 16:28:51 Believe me. Fuel prices are decided only by the oil companies and not by the central government, except during elections.
4260 2018-05-24 16:28:49 pls compare crude oil prices before posting facts

This price hike is due to govt unfulfilled thirst for money

4263 2018-05-24 16:28:38 Clearly. He also seems to translate his writing into tweets well. I can't seem to make that happen the way I'd like. 

I wish I could remember specifically why he blocked me. I recall discussing oil/LNG pipelines and after I mentioned Genie Energy/Rothschild I was blocked.
4264 2018-05-24 16:28:38 For the benefit of hard core unionists, allow me to rephrase that;

Why does Norway have a $1 trillion oil fund, while the UK has nothing?

4271 2018-05-24 16:28:06 Neither is happy, who is filling you in. Tariff the hell out of everything manufactured in  from Winnipeg east. No jobs, No votes. Then you need to tell Trudumb to get the pipeline moving oil South. Last but not least you need to put sanctions on Bombardier/ terrorist 
4272 2018-05-24 16:28:03 The guy at NTB keeps smashing the shit out of the keys on his keyboard, like damn man all I need is an oil change and none of this hostility.

4282 2018-05-24 16:26:54 A pan, a wrench probably to empty the oil pan, maybe a jack to raise the car. I'd get two. And grab a bottle of Castrol. Doesn't matter what kind.
4283 2018-05-24 16:26:48 I was going to tell you go to hell but I seen you're wearing a wedding ring so you are already there.
4284 2018-05-24 16:26:34 I felt like Obama was trying to box in Putin financially via sanctions and keeping oil prices down by promoting fracking. He got elected on what basically amounts to a “no boots on the ground” foreign policy after all so he was always averse to getting dragged into another Iraq.
4285 2018-05-24 16:26:29 Well the stamp is Federal, right? And they are not very pro oil, right? And they are envious of the revenues generated from the oil sands, correct? But they are oil sands! We extract oil, and not tar?
4286 2018-05-24 16:26:22 @BJP4India @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp BJP did Bharat Bandh due to petrol hike during UPA 2012 and now why so heavy excise duty with lower crude oil rate & also petroleum products not under GST ? Price hike after KA election!! Is it so called #AchheDin
4287 2018-05-24 16:26:22 Yeah well the really perverse part is that people up in the intelligence apparatus can let a bunch of terrorists sneak through their ubiquitous surveillance net to commit a terrorist attack here or there, and you get entire generations signing up to fight mideast wars for oil.
4288 2018-05-24 16:26:19 The enemy of my enemy is my friend is the concept with the Saudis at this point. What would you have them do? You don't have to answer. I already know. Sit back, do nothing and wait for the jihadi extremists and Iran to take over KSA and access to all that oil.
4289 2018-05-24 16:26:04 Oil would have a better spray distribution than a powder mixed in water I think.
4290 2018-05-24 16:25:54 Trump is more globalist than all of them. All his money comes from Russia (real estate money laundering), China (manufacturing), and the Middle East (under the table emission reduction/ oil profit).  Get real.
4291 2018-05-24 16:25:47 Holy shit yes burning on hot oil is excruciating
4292 2018-05-24 16:25:45 you should try lavender brownies! you mix one or two drops of lavender oil into vegetable oil and add it to the brownie mix and the taste is pretty slight.

4298 2018-05-24 16:25:20 This is about removing the safety of a FDA regulation. As a terminal patient, I can assure you this will not prolong my life unless I can afford the drug costs out of pocket. Insurance companies don’t have to cover experimental drugs! You snake oil salesman
4299 2018-05-24 16:25:19 Bush DIDN’T lie. It WAS NOT all about oil.
4300 2018-05-24 16:25:19 Not sure your numbers are right. There are not 35,000 tanker movements carrying heavy oil every year around here. I know tankers already carry dilbit from Burnaby, and that tankers already go between Alaska and Washington... but 35k sounds closer to overall vessel trips to me.

4304 2018-05-24 16:24:57 First, the National Anthum is a song about war. The United States has been in war for over 12 years over control of oil. Second, Kaep only stressed his opinion. Black are being tased, beaten, assaulted, and killed by policemen every day! the first amendment? Kaep was correct.
4305 2018-05-24 16:24:53 I believe suffering changes us( hopefully always tears good). Fyi, during my husbands radiation for prostate cancer I used pure organic EMU oil. Drs n radiology all wanted to know what we were using-no burns! Haven’t a clue if it would help your condition but might be helpful.
4306 2018-05-24 16:24:50 You hit a key point of failure in the Take Charge program... Also applies to the Commercial upgrade program, no help for res/bus stuck with oil. Easy to convert joules to watts and make oil systems applicable.
4307 2018-05-24 16:24:43 Same I’ve been using it religiously since I was like 15 and my hair is perfectly fine but I only use the argon oil one
4308 2018-05-24 16:24:29 i need to get my oil changed
4309 2018-05-24 16:24:26 I'm interested in how people's beliefs change to reflect their employment choices. Here in Calgary, lots of people work in oil & gas.  I've watched several "liberal" friends drastically change their views as they advance in the industry.  3/n
4310 2018-05-24 16:24:07 Don't worry he is thinking on a different plane a sign of genius
Must be contemplating ways now to turn Aalu into oil that's why he referred to oil in Kgs..Aap log bhi na....
4311 2018-05-24 16:24:03 The cost of CBD cannabis oil compared to pharmaceutical drugs is minimal. It can dramatically reduce overwhelming long term burden on the health care system... so it is obvious the gov't would SAVE MONEY!!
4312 2018-05-24 16:23:54 I agree. It’s way past time to get tough on false accusers.
4313 2018-05-24 16:23:50 Traditional competition is built on exclusive access to physical resources e.g. an oil field. Platform competition, instead, is built on exclusive access to the ecosystem around the platform. Their ability to mine their interaction data win #mba2k16 @FareesaMalik #lecture16
4314 2018-05-24 16:23:49 I can’t believe it takes this long for a oil change 
4315 2018-05-24 16:23:35 never forget the time we were in the studio recording the @LongNeckLass album and made a whole stir fry with only sesame oil. True Madness
4316 2018-05-24 16:23:27 just like Obama's post BP oil spill regs hurt "mom and pop" oil refineries
4317 2018-05-24 16:23:24 Don't need oil.  Oil is the anti-fairy dust and your specious economic arguments ignore the inevitable and enormous cleanup costs.

4321 2018-05-24 16:22:53 Forty years of Progressive Conservative bungling, and squandering of Alberta's oil money have made the province a shell of its former self, not the NDP.
4322 2018-05-24 16:22:52 Our problem is comparing mediocrity with more mediocrity!! I would not regard increased foreign reserve (due to increasing oil prices) as something to jump about! I am looking at unemployment, healthcare, education, our refineries, how much has he achieved?
4323 2018-05-24 16:22:48 Believe me. Fuel prices are decided only by the oil companies and not by the central government, except during elections. @K_T_L @chandruthiru @Zoheb_Sh @HasibaAmin @RuchiraC

4325 2018-05-24 16:22:46 The town crier stopped me in the market square to tell me it was impossible to get the ghosts out of my eyes with snake oil and cocaine so i came in his wife. Welcome to the world of bovine aids you absolute bafoon.
4326 2018-05-24 16:22:46 The EU have already said scots would be fastracked right in with the largest oil and gas fields in Europe,,they want access to that,,,and they are happy to stick it to brexit by helping scots who didn't vote for it,so in the EU scots have more influence than UK does,,,lol,,,,lol
4327 2018-05-24 16:22:33 Anything that a government agency recommends I do the exact opposite.  They have no clue how good coconut oil is good for you.
4328 2018-05-24 16:22:29 Guys! I love to chat with people but I am not using twitter as a dating site! Also ALL scammers need not try me! If you are on a peace mission in another country or work on an oil riggs don’t bother! Also I NEVER send money to someone I have never met! Thank you!
4329 2018-05-24 16:22:26 To say that a snake oil salesman is a great man only states that he is a great snake oil salesman.

4347 2018-05-24 16:21:23 Before you shower put coconut oil on the ends of your hair to the middle, don’t need to put it on your roots because it already has natural oils. Put up your hair, wait 30min then shower it off/wash etc
4348 2018-05-24 16:21:20 Oil also per kg.
4349 2018-05-24 16:21:20 Where did you that from? We are out of recession because oil prices have gone up. Stop give out lies here. Nigeria has not diversified it economy  pls go and check the NBS website for further clarification
4350 2018-05-24 16:21:17 NPA stated that all the dept owed by the NNPC from 2017 to date amounting to about N2.1billion for service rendered to the national oil firm are to be settled this week.

4356 2018-05-24 16:21:01 Oil price per barrel is low. At this point Rahul @RahulGandhi was correct. If the same ratio is considered oil should have been at 60-63 not 78. Be logical not andh bhakt.
4357 2018-05-24 16:21:01 You're right though and the Ottoman empire was in the middle East too but we are talking about the US here who only fights for oil.l because your freedom is here in the states (if you do live here in the states though)

4362 2018-05-24 16:20:37 It is drying because it’s clay. Over drying your skin can cause your skin to over overproduce oil which can cause acne as well. So that’s why they might recommend against it. That’s why I like to use it only in my oily areas or areas I have acne in.
4363 2018-05-24 16:20:22 Why is my face oily all the time. Does my body store oil somewhere 
4364 2018-05-24 16:20:05 Dunno how you didn't end up launching that oil at his face
4365 2018-05-24 16:19:54 I wish I had a video of me falling flat on my face a few weeks ago while bowling. I think they use baby oil on the lanes. Just use your imagination. My arm still hurts.
4366 2018-05-24 16:19:54 Haha, I knew what you meant. Yes, you're nicely complected, the result of so much produce and olive oil. Good skin starts from within. It's one reason Italians have such amazing complexions because of a diet rich in frutta e verdura.

4428 2018-05-24 16:14:06 I don't see it yet. Russia just imposed economic sanctions against the US in retaliation for our escalating actions against them. OTOH, oil is rising and that helps Russia. And Manafort was horrible wrt Ukraine, and that leads to grave concerns. But no "Reset" button yet.

4434 2018-05-24 16:13:43 This is one administration that did not give entire focus to the oil sector. It's policy of diversification brought great growth on the agricultural and solid mineral sector which is one of the reason we are no longer in recession.

4447 2018-05-24 16:12:59 Russia knows that the cheapest asset on the planet is physical gold, having been diluted 100x or more by paper.  If a big physical oil player continuously bids for gold for long enough, the gold market will eventually break like it did post-London Gold Pool.  History is rhyming
4448 2018-05-24 16:12:57 Yes, it is very upside down. The situation is so nonsensical it's increasingly challenging not to conclude it has more to do with "Alberta" than with oil. It bedevils me to figure out why though. Not quite sure what AB has done to earn BC and Quebec's ire.

4450 2018-05-24 16:12:51 PLP rejected Select Committee for Rubis Oil Leak... FNM rejects Select Committee for Oban deal handling. One is a bit different in my opinion... They still have a chance to get Oban deal right before anything happens. Rubis on the other hand... Wow!

4461 2018-05-24 16:12:10 Don't forget the Maritimes also uses coal from Venezuela  to make that clean electricity that comes out of the wall. Lol.
Over %50 of Maritimes still burns home heating oil, yes even in the cities.
4462 2018-05-24 16:12:08 I'm sorry, but if you drive into a Garage for a Oil Change, because they have a $20 Oil sale going on and you have nothing else wrong with your car (which they know) and they try and upsell you for shit you don't need. Now, there is most certainly something wrong with that.

4468 2018-05-24 16:11:37 It goes beyond him really.

Iran has oil, a youthful population, quite developed by world's standard and has large gas deposit.

Controls the Shia side of Islam.

So, begging and seeking aids is almost off the table for them.

No leash.

That's a problem.

4499 2018-05-24 16:09:36 Decarbonization (e.g., more EVs) actually has a net tightening effect on oil demand because it's having some impact in disincentivizing investments into long-term capacity. EV impact on demand by 2030 is less than 4mm bpd

4563 2018-05-24 16:04:53 With whole life, the amounts are much less (usually less than 30k) and the premiums are much higher. But they do lock in price and benefits so as long as your premiums are paid, you’re good. If you’re young and don’t smoke, id look into it as it can build up to 5% cash value

4566 2018-05-24 16:04:37 so evidently the secret to a good hair day is just water. the minute I put oil or hair smoothies in it. it frizzes. I also have to wash my hair in a certain direction to get it to "lay" right.
4567 2018-05-24 16:04:34 ...and in Canada, fuel doesn't come from the oil sands; it comes from a gas station.
4568 2018-05-24 16:04:33 It's still oil, but you get in trouble if you spill it.
4569 2018-05-24 16:04:27 He also needs to explain how he will fulfill all his promises that add up to about 20 billion dollars.  All Ford has done is shout out promises without a plan.  Anybody can do that.  It's amazing how his supporters fall for him and don't see he is only snake oil.

4576 2018-05-24 16:03:42 Great point. Deregulation of rail was a key enabler of low-cost compliance (via PRB coal) with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Maybe we should re-regulate the rail sector as a way to keep coal and oil in the ground? Alfred Kahn just rolled over multiple times.

4578 2018-05-24 16:03:39 Kim was never going. DT hyped this up for his base. Have you seen "Water World"? The minions kept rowing the boat to "dry land" well that is DT base they just keep rowing that oil tanker to no where.
4579 2018-05-24 16:03:39 Do u need  someone to rub tanning oil on u cause I volunteer as tribute
4580 2018-05-24 16:03:38 NO SIR! VOTING IN THIS WICKED SYSTEM WILL NOT HELP US. SEPARATE AND BOYCOTT THE VERY THING THAT AMERICA DEPENDS ON......THEIR GOD (Gold Oil & Drugs) MONEY!
4581 2018-05-24 16:03:36 Yea that was a slick move on Trumps part. In addition to the oil, instead of having to worry about 1 countries nuclear program,  we now have to worry about 2 of them.
4582 2018-05-24 16:03:17 crude oil is probably the largest source of conflict in the 21st century (that and religion)
4583 2018-05-24 16:03:16 Congress is saying that reduce the oil prices and it's a challenge.. Laughed out loud.. cos PM Modi is paying for oil which you forgot very easily.. I guess as the president of national party you must be aware about the money India has to pay.. please tell..
4584 2018-05-24 16:03:15 Nice! I've tried it at cafes and it tastes a little bitter to me. I notice the commercial varieties have added oil and yours doesn't - is it still pretty creamy?
4585 2018-05-24 16:03:13 This is not true. Chrysler has refused new unit because of update next month. We went in for oil change on Tuesday. Still no car. It's a death trap. WHY DO YOU NOT CARE? Ourisman Dealership even worse.
4586 2018-05-24 16:03:07 Does the OP mean research chemicals, or does he mean thc/cbd/etc vape oil? THC distillate is fine, but synthetic cannabinoids are very dangerous, potentially even deadly -- same cannot be said of cannabis derived oils. Research chems kill.
4587 2018-05-24 16:03:03 i like using tea tree oil, but dilute it a little bit!

4591 2018-05-24 16:02:39 I would recommend a 'dogma whatever it is' Danish film called 'Festen'. No spoilers, but it's from the same school as yer man Von Trier and frankly, apart from the one set on the oil rig, it knocks his stuff out of the water.

Festen: several thumbs up.

All the best!

4594 2018-05-24 16:02:17 because it’s cheap & offers to pay out a fortune, it’s easy to sell. But the fine print on Term policies always give the company an out to not pay. They can cancel your policy for damn near anything & even if they don’t, they’ll threaten to bury a family in court fees to not pay.

4596 2018-05-24 16:02:13 It matters because it's traveling by oil tanker, rather than in the pipeline that's already there.

It seems EM oil demand will underwhelm this year, mostly due to China. 

Strong auto sales will certainly raise demand but I see 3 big shifts suppressing demand growth

1) switching to E10 from E3 (-350k)
2) EV penetration (-100k)
3) Bus electrification (-250k)

4691 2018-05-24 15:54:13 Your statement that the pipeline was solely for bitumen, that technology is available to transition off fossil fuels immediately, that Trans Mountain will result in a 40% increase in oil sands extraction as a short list. All demonstrably wrong.
4692 2018-05-24 15:54:00 WTI oil at $70.94/barrel, $-0.89 as prices have been edging lower due in part that OPEC could boost output.
4693 2018-05-24 15:53:59 Why didn’t Israel return the Golan Heights back to Syria? Simple, racist apartheid Zionist Jews wanted the land and water.  Now they want the oil too. Never trust an evil Zionist as stealing comes natural to them.
4694 2018-05-24 15:53:43 If you buy the tahini in a halal or middleeastern grocery its much cheaper than super market, as is olive oil. They typically sell Lebanese olive oil which is amazingly tasty

The food taste steamed and not microwaved and there is no oil to worry about.

4711 2018-05-24 15:51:53 @GAMIR_INC said that, why the petrol-diesel rates have gone up despite a fall in international crude oil prices.The common man has only one question today- when the crude prices are low, why is it that petrol prices are Rs 85 per litre and diesel Rs 73 here now.
4712 2018-05-24 15:51:52 Russia, known to go against US global treaties, may defend NKs sanctions placed by US govt in the wake of NKs embargo's...NK, left without enough oil on their island to power ballistic missles and to opt any try at nuclear weapons, has been seen getting supplies also from China..
4713 2018-05-24 15:51:41 Whole life isn’t terrible on its own. It’s a smaller amount that’s cheaper and builds cash value. It’s a beating once you hit 50 cause the premiums skyrocket. But if you get it at 20, and you’re clever you can make some decent money off it.
4714 2018-05-24 15:51:22 Ah, you learned from the IPPs, where we committed to pay American racketeers for oil they promised to produce even if not produced let alone consumed. Good, let us use the same crooked deal on the Chinese. We learned much from America indeed.

4737 2018-05-24 15:49:13 If Congress was in power, & tax on petrol/diesel was around same as it was under UPA, Considering how much international crude oil prices have fallen, petrol would cost around Rs. 50 today. #FuelChallenge
4738 2018-05-24 15:49:09 It'd be politically toxic to subsidize people who heat with oil, without offering the same opportunity to electricity users. And if everybody does heat pumps, the amount of electricity usage will drop, driving up rates.

1980s oil value on $18 with approx 3.5bn barrels available
Adjust for inflation to today would be $80pb
Actual price today $80pb with over 4 billion barrels available
How can we be poor when in 1980s/90s it made London very rich?
4741 2018-05-24 15:48:53 Russian economy tanking; living off oil & gas. China's prosperity, solid progress is not at all linked to authoritarian government but the fact that Chinese are naturally hardworking and clever. But that's no reason to cow-taw to them. Cow, get it—getting milked?

4760 2018-05-24 15:47:12 Nice.  Promoting an ad encouraging fracking in Colorado.  No thanks....next you'll promote how we need to become self sufficient and not import oil.  Make sure you tell everyone how the oil found here is exported to other countries.  Just look at how oil prices are rising.  Scam.
4761 2018-05-24 15:46:52 My sentiments exactly! How this man gets paid for this I do not know? Ashton, Durham, Talkshite and Sky Sports will be genuinely disappointed by this as it’ll be oil in their pro Liverpool narrative water.
4762 2018-05-24 15:46:46 No, BC has ZERO impact on what is happening in AB's oil patch unless the plan is to EXPAND operations for the purpose of selling oil to Asia, loading that at Westridge and hauling it through Metro Vancouver. If anyone is meddling...it's AB with BC's coast!

4771 2018-05-24 15:46:16 Its the same way with beef, lumber,copper and other valuable resources they go overseas . We don't need to b drilling for any more oil here only to have it exported to other countries So some oil company can make a lot of money . The Native Americans are still being abused.
4772 2018-05-24 15:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or was never deported.
4773 2018-05-24 15:46:09 1) I make the Extreme oil, the Holy oil, and a spray on tincture. The Extreme oil is a pure cannabis oil concentrated about 30:1 and knocks out addictions on the 1st dose and can reverse cancer. Add the Holy oil and that also helps and heals infections and much more.

4782 2018-05-24 15:45:42 @dpradhanbjp Sir when at international level oil rates were less no relief were given to common man.
Now when its increased uu also  increased rates..stating increment in rates not in ur hand..
Why uu didnt provide relief when actually rates were to less..in international prices?
4783 2018-05-24 15:45:40 The govt. has certainly erred in structuring oil prices.The democratic govt. should always be responsive to the concerns of the People.The govt. took advantage of low crude prices, now it should share the burden of rise and keep the oil prices within a reasonable ba nd.
4784 2018-05-24 15:45:36 I av 4gotten dt u are not alright. Same same. U are even worse! If ur party (GEJ) had performed well despite d high price of crude oil as at then, Buhari wud not av comeback
4785 2018-05-24 15:45:33 Or you should work to prioritize legislation that funds other modes of transportation and alternatives fuels so we don't have to use oil.
4786 2018-05-24 15:45:32 Well there again, Russia actually has more oil n gas *resources* especially in Siberia and the Artic, than even we or Suadis do, they just have only begun to develop them.

4797 2018-05-24 15:44:22 The lower level is your oil fill line.

4825 2018-05-24 15:42:16 I was high one day and watched a bunch of documentaries on goverment control,war on drugs and oil;
4826 2018-05-24 15:42:15 In February 2013, Israeli authorities awarded Afek Oil and Gas an exclusive 36-month petroleum exploration license to a 153-square-mile (400 km2) plot in the Golan Heights, which the UN recognizes to be Syrian territory- Wikipedia

4829 2018-05-24 15:41:53 The media has completely ignored our technology, which is the only NEW one in the world! But, I guess it's better than just attacking us without even seeing it! They're also helping the oil & gas companies just cover up the existence of this new method to stop blowouts! Why?
4830 2018-05-24 15:41:50 Oy vey, good luck girl! Luckily Kyle knows a guy who knows a guy (as you know lol) so tires were cheap but then it's finding the time for him to install and I need an oil change. And then in June it's everyone's birthday/Father's Day. RIP savings account.
4831 2018-05-24 15:41:40 Very unfortunate statement by petroleum minister. If all r depends upon crude oil prices then what ru doing?. If ur nt manages well then ur simply inefficient.
4832 2018-05-24 15:41:39 Absolutely sick to death of seeing fucking cbd oil all over social media
4833 2018-05-24 15:41:36 Damn so hu pump de oil into my body

4837 2018-05-24 15:41:18 They definitely didn't notice ISIS 'oil convoys' driving north into Turkey.  Neither did the Turks. But when the Russians told them - the Thunderbolts contaminated the highway for the next couple of millennia.
4838 2018-05-24 15:41:18 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

Hindustan people need half the price of oil. Do not speeches. Do some public work too.The dumb deaf Modi is not feeling the pain of the general public.Stay away from this Baazigar Modi.
4845 2018-05-24 15:41:02 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
4846 2018-05-24 15:41:01 •Drink 2L of water everyday
(This is not only good for your health but is also good for your skin)

•If you have sensitive skin use coconut oil for your skin. 

•Start washing your face with cold water twice a day (this helps by your skin from being dirty)
4847 2018-05-24 15:41:00 Government has huge earnings through the direct taxes such as income tax, corporate tax, GST, VAT etc. But still slowly working the knife of petro price hike on the throat of poor in name of "Vikas Karya"..? The benefits of fallen crude oil prices were never given in last 4 years
4848 2018-05-24 15:40:40 Nah man it’s Oil
4849 2018-05-24 15:40:37 OMG, that Jeff Daniels clip. I hate it.

4855 2018-05-24 15:40:21 An idea for how to reduce CO2 emissions AND increase our usage of Muskrat Falls power (to reduce the cost per kilowatt hour):

Take a chunk of carbon tax revenue and heavily subsidize heat pumps for current oil users. They're no longer using dirty oil and use some excess power
4856 2018-05-24 15:40:20 Have you done an oil scene?

After May 26, 2014, International Crude Oil Prices have come down by more than 30%. Modi Govt. earned a windfall of ₹9,95,850Cr (9.95 Lakh Cr)  by levying various Central Taxes on Petrol/Diesel (Till Dec 2017).It is over 10Lakh Cr now! Where has the money gone?
4858 2018-05-24 15:40:18 Decime el precio del oil y te dire las noticias.

4865 2018-05-24 15:39:42 Dear  Mr Prime Minister this concerned #Albertan questions why #Canada is sending our Armed Services to #Mali a country in Africa when more troops are desperately needed in BC and Atlantic Canada for flood relief and to build KM & get our oil & gas to market @JustinTrudeau #YYC
4866 2018-05-24 15:39:40 radishes tossed w/olive oil & roasted are amazing; also: sliced, lightly salted and stacked on well-buttered, toasted sourdough--oh, i see your problem here. It's not the radish, per se.
4867 2018-05-24 15:39:33 few drops of bio oil in ur bath tub boom
4868 2018-05-24 15:39:28 Pls, while everyone is here, just buy perfume oil from our IG store avoid inconveniencing the person beside you
4869 2018-05-24 15:39:28 Yes but by withdrawing the tax breaks on oil and gas, or on the billions of investment in a LNG facility  and allowing subsidies on wind and solar along with tax breaks he is effectively not only trying to end the breaks but kill the industry as he has already promised to do
4870 2018-05-24 15:39:23 Why are old ppl weird... ”we have a guy over checking our oil burner. He’s single! I told him you are single too!” ...let me and my non-existing love life be, grandma -.-"
4871 2018-05-24 15:39:19 Chairman Kaplin is well versed in oil policy and this should be an interesting talk
4872 2018-05-24 15:39:17 2 Officers from #Scarborough have been called to reports of a container of an unknown liquid found outside a property on Nansen Street. This was engine oil spread by moving traffic onto Garfield Rd & Nares St. @HighwaysYORKS requested to attend and deal.
4873 2018-05-24 15:39:05 Memories of ice and deadhouse gates might be my favorites. I adored the siege of capustan and the crawling under ehrlitan. I can’t look at olive oil the same anymore. Brukalian knowingly charging to his death on his warhorse, sword ablaze with black fire
4874 2018-05-24 15:39:01 That won't even pay for the oil change in his Lambo
4875 2018-05-24 15:38:49 Don’t stop fighting for your constituents, keep doing EXACTLY what you are doing. Our tax dollars should still be going to Flint, but .@EPAScottPruitt needs a 1st class  and a secret phone booth to talk to his oil buddies!

Is this what they think #MAGA looks like?
4876 2018-05-24 15:38:48 With MCT oil I feel like I have to run. The energy is crazy.Its like I'm running on airplane gas.#MCToil #airplanegas
4877 2018-05-24 15:38:46 Haha where is the oil? Away and get real Brenda or whoever you really are! You are of no purpose in this conversation. Tally ho! Toodle pip! Now be gone
4878 2018-05-24 15:38:45 Go get my nails done THEN induce my own labor with this oil 
4879 2018-05-24 15:38:41 I can see that , EV are going to last way longer than traditional gas powered vehicle , hence not selling new . I switched over most of my Forklifts to electric over 10yrs ago and was the best thing ever compared to the gas . Big OIL , Ethanol and Government are the big losers
4880 2018-05-24 15:38:35 Perhaps if you had taken this approach 3 years ago instead of destroying Alberta first it might have made a difference.  You bought into all the rubbish about social license and "bad Oil" before starting to see any change...things got worse not better!
4881 2018-05-24 15:38:04 I came for an oil change on the clock fuck yeah
4882 2018-05-24 15:38:01 hehehehe i get u..yes from what ive tried, castor oil is much easier to wash out if u mix it well with another kind of oil

4886 2018-05-24 15:37:44 First I was oh shit the cotton candy strain then I was like oh gross that tobacco oil. The fucking clove cigarettes for the new college set. Pass. The vape if it's OG Kush tho
4887 2018-05-24 15:37:42 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts olive oil with 1 part white wine vinegar and 1 part mustard. Add basil and brown sugar to taste.
4888 2018-05-24 15:37:41 Living in Spain spoiled me . I only like to drink Spanish wine and eat Spanish olive oil and drink cava .

4896 2018-05-24 15:36:36 As long as Iraq relies on movements in oil price to dictate spending, there are going to be problems. The whole economic model needs to be revisited. The "working age" population will grow by 20 million in the next 25 years, even oil at $150 can't remedy that.
4897 2018-05-24 15:36:30 There are two kinds of Trumpers:

The ones who were stupid enough to buy snake oil. 

And the ones who were dumb enough to buy snake oil knowing full well it was snake oil but still expected it to work.
4898 2018-05-24 15:36:28 I have a problem with drenching myself in coconut oil BUT it does make me soft and look all shiny so is it really a problem??
4899 2018-05-24 15:36:27 Try this olive oil moose, it works good for me and it doesn’t make my hair hard
4900 2018-05-24 15:36:21 Basically when oil prices were all time high, UPA govt subsidized it by getting oil from Iran with promise to pay in future. Now current Government has to foot the bill. ! That's kind of economy Farhan seems to like.
4901 2018-05-24 15:36:19 Brussel sprouts. A little oil and salt then bake them. MMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
4902 2018-05-24 15:36:11 JUST ADD THE CRUD OIL PRICE ALSO TO COMPARE FULLY, THIS IS SEMI TRUTH ONLY LIKE PM'S JUMLA.
4903 2018-05-24 15:36:09 Tea tree oil really heals scars?
4904 2018-05-24 15:35:55 Yeah, it hurt in many ways. But this is what happens in capitalism time and time again.  Oil companies have been raking in money throughout this entire thing. Do you not understand they had contracts to sell at certain prices and still were even when the price dropped? Or that
4905 2018-05-24 15:35:55 @RahulGandhi I agree with Prof Saroj Giri. Look at his challenge to Modiji for bringing down petrol prices. Does he understand the ground realities and Saudi’s decision to hike its price etc., Oil ministry is working out the details. Decision can’t be taken just like that.
4906 2018-05-24 15:35:53 おめめとー！！！！　年齢の話をしてはいけない…
4907 2018-05-24 15:35:47 This oil isn’t for Canada though.
4908 2018-05-24 15:35:46 Iraq is gone to dust. truly sad to see such a wealthy oil rich country that produce 4 million barrel a day still have displaced ppl & majority living in poverty 
4909 2018-05-24 15:35:43 Getting an oil change n it’s like if it’s one thing it’s another just can’t get one thing done w/o fixing another I swear 
4910 2018-05-24 15:35:42 @westberksbrew the renegade website implies Snake oil is back in stock. But not the actual WBB website....is it?
4911 2018-05-24 15:35:25 mmm ive noticed tht but when i mix it w sweet almond oil it washes out easier!!!!
4912 2018-05-24 15:35:20 That used to be true, not anymore! Now all it does is ruin your day, and the day after that! Whatever Oil they are using must be old or bad to begin with.
Serve the real Restaurant KFC Chicken to the CEO for dinner and see how he feels!
4913 2018-05-24 15:35:10 Hike in oil price is depends upon the price of crude oil in international market and the exchange value of rupees against dollars. Neither state nor central govt. can do anything.
4914 2018-05-24 15:35:09 Overall inflation is pretty low ,so honestly I don’t mind the fuel priced & we don’t want to duck up oil prices again
4915 2018-05-24 15:35:02 The money laundering through American real estate by oil oligarchs was to help pro-Putin candidate in Ukraine who Manafort was the campaign manager for.
4916 2018-05-24 15:34:59 i have v thick hair so i prefer thicker oil but generally any oil goes!! and i've had great results with castor oil too but it kinda annoying to rinse out in my experience u_u
4917 2018-05-24 15:34:51 Karaage, tonkatsu, breaded shrimp, and tempura are all fried in oil, right? But they're not aburaage ("oil-fried")!?
4918 2018-05-24 15:34:44 Its everywhere in my city, I've talked to other people about CBD how its really affordable and not only does it comes in oil but it also comes in edibles which is really helpful for young children with health conditions.
4919 2018-05-24 15:34:38 this guy goes on the James Howard Kunstler podcast all the time and is a huge peak oil dude in addition to the crank beliefs he managed to fit into his bio. he's hilariously talked kunstler into being a big anti-campus PC guy
4920 2018-05-24 15:34:27 Holy oil
4921 2018-05-24 15:34:20 No problem. Every little bit counts!... I do believe that one of the very first blog posts of yours I read was about palm oil and it's effect on the environment!

4944 2018-05-24 15:32:16 I do not live in a cage typical of a Snat to make up LIBEL fake news like that - where is the OIL ??
4945 2018-05-24 15:32:15 Oil is provided by suppliers worldwide some of whom are very bad actors politically and environmentally. Better Canadian oil displaces these sources than the other way around. Pipelines dont create more demand for oil. The global economy does.
4946 2018-05-24 15:32:00 Wait... but they kept that braintrust. Oh because Oiler fans trust that brain
4947 2018-05-24 15:31:54 Like my 8th grade teacher tellin me specifically how he like to lay out plastic on the floor and play wit his bitches in baby oil.

4950 2018-05-24 15:31:44 Thanks so much for the reply! As a millennial I am sure wind and solar will replace gas and oil and I want to put my money where my mouth is!
4951 2018-05-24 15:31:42 Your use of the slogan, "Colorado pushes back" is misleading. Your ad would be more accurately stated that "Oil companies (you) are pushing back". You don't care about the environment in Colorado or anywhere else. Your focus is on profit. Your profit.

4956 2018-05-24 15:31:29 Trump's first action as Pres: appoint the "swamp" to Cabinet. The privatization, corporate welfare, fascist, proactive disaster capitalist, fossil-fuel era desperados racing down the path of death. Oil, military, bank fraud, real estate fraud, investor fraud, etc.
4957 2018-05-24 15:31:22 and by the way why don’t you ask congress party (congress ruling state) to cut state tax from oil price, this will helps to pressurise  modi govt.. ohhh sorry i forget how many state they have left 
4958 2018-05-24 15:31:12 Finally!!  Someone not taking the P***

Dude, Dip a paper towel into the detergent mixture, and rub the soapy mix vigorously into the oily or greasy portions of the glass . Concentrate on the oily sections of glass, for now, to avoid spreading oil to other parts of the glass

4960 2018-05-24 15:31:08 I appreciate these facts Stefan, and as a journalist I'm not taking a position for or against this project, but would you concede a significant increase in tanker traffic and increased risk of heavy oil spill could have some impact on orca populations?
4961 2018-05-24 15:30:55 PM @narendramodi & @dpradhanbjp DO NOT decrease fuel prices. Its still cheaper than Japan, Singapore & many EU nations. Corrupt Ambani MSM @CNNnews18 @ndtv & others want 2 serve own oil interests & keep India underdeveloped while he is Fortune Baby? @MirrorNow @aajtak @abpnewstv

4964 2018-05-24 15:30:42 He's also laser focused on the use of guns. Why not just look at homicide rates? Im pretty certain, and correct me if I'm wrong here, that the US per capita is pretty low compared to the rest of the world. Keep in mind we are the world's third largest population.

4972 2018-05-24 15:30:08 Trump is re-doing the Iran sanctions, so we won't be buying any more oil from Iran anyway.
4973 2018-05-24 15:30:08 Our Economy looks bigger because we have an over inflated market aND WORSE We have printed so much money with virtually  nothing to back it up except the 'petrodollar'.
And when countries refuse to use our $$ to buy n sell commodities like oil, it will collapse.
4974 2018-05-24 15:29:51 Here's the thing about investing in oil exploration/production companies. They are the ultimate price-takers and have no control over their revenue streams. Even the smartest operators can lose their shirts if for example the Saudis rev up the pumps.
4975 2018-05-24 15:29:48 Shea butter isn't oil though . Actually, it's non-comedogenic and in its unrefined state has natural moisturizing properties and is safe to use on your face. But alright lol

4977 2018-05-24 15:29:25 Also put dollar rates and per barrel crude oil rates ... for better understanding!
4978 2018-05-24 15:29:23 The oil barons and military contractors love Trump because he is easy to manipulate and will do whatever they want. Now with a former CIA director as Secretary of State and two stooges running the House & Senate, the ruling class has basically taken over the federal government.
4979 2018-05-24 15:29:22 Americans: *Russia put out pro-Trump fake news on Facebook* HOW DARE A HOSTILE FOREIGN POWER BESMIRCH THIS TEMPLE OF DEMOCRACY!

4994 2018-05-24 15:28:04 Who is buying the Canadian oil and gas? and who is buying oil from Roque countries? Carbon tax on oil from Roque countries should be much greater-plus if Canada is going to be oil free by 2025 as Trudeau says then I would say the oil companies should gouge even more for profits
4995 2018-05-24 15:28:00 Forget world peace. My only concern is that #DonaldTrump’s cancellation of talks with Kim Jong Un should not be another reason here in India for the rising crude oil prices. #PetrolDieselPriceHike

5036 2018-05-24 15:24:28 Right, but all proposed pipelines through BC are destined for the coast, so oil can be shipped to China. British Columbians will never accept these pipelines. What I mean is it's pointless for Albertans to speak about financial benefits. British Columbians don't care about that.

5054 2018-05-24 15:22:49 This is the real point,just divert the issue as they have no intention to reduce oil price for the sake of common people.

5056 2018-05-24 15:22:45 Because this is a question is short term economic benefit, or long term economic stability. I don't want to keep investing in oil, I want Canada to be leading edge for renewable power. We can definitely disagree on this matter, but that's where I stand.

5078 2018-05-24 15:20:26 Huge difference this time @MrsGandhi - the global oil prices were between $100-125. Last four years it has been between $40-80. You know this too and still tweet nonsense. Don’t make a fool of yourself. And I am NOT a Congress supporter.

5081 2018-05-24 15:20:08 SNP predicts Brexit will cost Scotland heavily but Growth Commission forecasts Independent Scotland could produce extra £4,100 for EVERY Scot. If that assumes EU membership, ignoring oil, forget Independence
5082 2018-05-24 15:19:48 If gas prices continue to rise as oil companies make record profits and pay no taxes..... republicans will lose the House in Nov.
5083 2018-05-24 15:19:45 Neither did Modi government piled up huge Oil debt.
5084 2018-05-24 15:19:43 Hydrate, seal with butter/oil, then gel. Helps w/ crunch. To redo edges I dampen w/ wet fingers and restyle. Once they're set I add a little oil again.
5085 2018-05-24 15:19:35 Oil is so weak it doesn’t do anything.
5086 2018-05-24 15:19:34 I like this other product called sunny isle. It has Jamaican black castor oil in it .
5087 2018-05-24 15:19:30 Such defective news info,  it' the barrels of oil that are about $80 per barrel... Just wait till its $100

5090 2018-05-24 15:19:25 Don’t waste your money on oil the only way to go is get it in concentrates or isolate.

5096 2018-05-24 15:18:59 I love the storm chasers photos, don’t get me wrong but it bugs me that some find it necessary to filter them to the point that they look like an oil painting and not an actual photograph.
5097 2018-05-24 15:18:57 All well and good but if you have too many guys that can't make a 10ft pass, playing an uptempo style becomes problematic. #Oilers
5098 2018-05-24 15:18:48 So ... Can you tell me why this oil does'nt get out via Fort Churchill Manitoba (or Peopletoba if you are liberal)

5111 2018-05-24 15:17:37 Also there is a lot of pressure being put on Germany just now with relation to the new gas pipeline. Going after Russia's key revenue stream, just as they were in Ukraine. Still, Russia probably aren't too unhappy with Trump reneging on the Nuclear deal. Oil price is soaring.

5119 2018-05-24 15:17:14 @realDonaldTrump Suspending ambassadors is like a game between children who behave badly. I believe that the real sanction is not to buy anymore oil from Venezuela and that way it puts two birds with a stone in checkmate.
5120 2018-05-24 15:17:07 Have your ever compared international crude oil prices of 2012 with those which prevailed in 2014 and until now? Your tweets smack of being posted by some nincompoop.

The only difference is, this time I will everything to make sure moulana modi doesnt grab power again. I repeat, BJP badly requires some serious lessons. This is another namazwadi party in making.
5125 2018-05-24 15:16:22 What,u think illegally signing party members and busing them in to ensure your preferred candidate gets a nomination is as bad as promoting oil wrestling? Obviously not, because Sue Ann doesn’t even mention it! It’s funny how the Sun has switched to a full bore attack on the NDP
5126 2018-05-24 15:16:19 @HighEnergyPerry  Sir, corporations got a tax cut and held prices and gave bonuses, that is most Corp's except Oil Corps who raised prices enough to negate individuals tax cuts. Speculators should be taxed at full income rate not 20% investment rate as President Trump said
5127 2018-05-24 15:16:05 Wish I could attend. I've seen a lot of snake oil over the years. Hope your doing well.

You do know occidental oil owns al gore, and owned his father before him. He still gets a monthly check from occidental oil for mineral rights in tennessee
5129 2018-05-24 15:15:57 Mr Akhtar you are wrong , crude oil is not usable as is. It needs to be processed to make, petrol, diesel , lube etc..

The Sanctions the US put on Russia backfired and Russia made even more profit on oil.
Overall, theie economy is in much better shap than ours is now.
Much less debt.

5138 2018-05-24 15:15:14 Was vaguely aware of this double change in direction; it's not as unusual as people think (particularly with oil). Thread respondents often seem unaware of concept of suezmax and panamax sizes.

Gas reserves are even more vast than oil's and could easily power the globe for centuries especially if we combine hydro & nuclear.

5218 2018-05-24 15:08:12 My word they've told us for years!Show us again and again. US and UK politicians have lied for that subversive ideology. Bush was an OIL MAN! He knew who they were and lied anyways! Butt Crack Obama was the worst liar but, NOT the first liar.
5219 2018-05-24 15:08:07 Keep trying to sell your snake oil Don.
5220 2018-05-24 15:08:05 I Agree
They just need revolution in their politics to get rid of the bought politicians working for the elite money men & all the War-mongers

If they'd spent the trillions their military has lost on health & infrastructure & renewable energy, they wouldn't need to fight for oil

5224 2018-05-24 15:07:59 Some of those countries have larger oil reserves than Iran does, you bloody moron.

They want the same thing we want: to not let the mullahs have city-destroying bombs.
5225 2018-05-24 15:07:56 I would love to have some comfrey oil. Plant does not grow in Panama. I make pain slaves with CBD, arnica, st. John's wort, coconut oil. Stopped shingle pain on a woman in less than 5 minutes on Tuesday.

5234 2018-05-24 15:07:15 How do you plan to take back OUR Scottish oil?  It doesn't belong to us as govt doesn't own the oil companies.  They are all owned by foreign conglomerates,  All we would get is the tax revenue.  Why is it snats are so blind and deluded
5235 2018-05-24 15:07:11 I am a robot. I piss oil
5236 2018-05-24 15:07:10 I shall again remind you that Romania was fast-tracked into the EU because it served a purpose.

The EU sidestepped their own requirements to fast-track them into the EU.

The EU continues to have open trade with Turkey regardless of Turkey buying oil from ISIS.

Disgusting.

5246 2018-05-24 15:06:19 @FoolMeTwice oil is too high up here imo. OPEC back in negative rhetoric. they r likely loosing mktshare up here. way above their sweetspot
5247 2018-05-24 15:06:16 An oil change should not take 3 hrs I can tell you that

5250 2018-05-24 15:06:01 Who will pay the oil dues to Iran for the oil bought during UPA govt??  6.5 billions
Sonia will pay, Rahul will pay or MMS will pay?? 
U Cong ppl pay those dues, oil price will come down to 50rs petrol. 
U bought the oil, gave the bills to Modi & escaped.
5251 2018-05-24 15:05:53 Oil down hard
5252 2018-05-24 15:05:48 First get your facts straight , tax has been increased. Also price of oil is inc. all over the world ,get out of your dumb head and see news dont judge before getting your facts straight
5253 2018-05-24 15:05:37 It really is heartbreaking. I try to cut out palm oil, but it’s in everything.
5254 2018-05-24 15:05:27 @RahulGandhi can u quote any instance when ur govt slashed taxes on oil to give even least respite? Why challenge present dispensation?
5255 2018-05-24 15:05:19 BTW Brent Crude is down by over 1% Today .. 
From which "Mochi ki Dukaan" @narendramodi buys crude oil? 
Why isn't #Fuel prices coming down when crude falls? 
Explain Modi-ji?

5256 2018-05-24 15:05:16 Even the NYT has no credibility, though. They're unaware of their biases; they ignore and marginalize science and facts. They're caught up in a system and can't see beyond that system.
The planet is going into crisis, but they report on price of oil...
They imply AGW is unreal.

5267 2018-05-24 15:04:40 Overview: 

UPA
$/barrel high - price 40-70 rupees (FISCAL CRISIS 2008 )

BJP
$/barrel low - price 68-84 rupees (fiscal deficit  decreased)
 
But Iran oil debt was not discussed ...
5268 2018-05-24 15:04:39 Because crude oil prices were high during Dr MMS UPA government . During third rated Feku period from 2014 onwards Crude price has plummeted like Fekus popularity. Too much for the comprehension of school dropout Feku and his Bhakts

5272 2018-05-24 15:04:07 More lies. We get tax on oil.
5273 2018-05-24 15:03:58 But of course.  His Lordship @RossOnRasslin  is a pheasant of the highest caliber wank and is a frequent purchaser of my Icelandic Cod Liver Oil in order to keep up his stamina in the boudoir  #thefishmonger

5277 2018-05-24 15:03:28 Weak oil?

5282 2018-05-24 15:03:11 Dear Rahul, 
why are you fooling the public, you reduce the cost of crude oil internationally, the Modi government will reduce the price of petrol diesel, it is my guarantee.
5283 2018-05-24 15:03:10 You are such a snake oil salesman!!  Almost tar and feather time!!

5288 2018-05-24 15:02:53 UPA paid back the Iran credit of imported oil then !!!

5292 2018-05-24 15:02:23 And when the oil industry measured these effects, they buried them and threw millions at people willing to obfuscate their own results.
5293 2018-05-24 15:02:21 Then I oiled my body with olive oil
5294 2018-05-24 15:02:16 This Is very controversial. Although The federal and Alberta governments support the Trans Mountain project this action could potentially lead to oil spills along the B.C coast.
5295 2018-05-24 15:01:55 I used butter and coconut oil. It doesn't taste bad. I get kinda full from coffee in the morning anyways but I'm trying this just to try it.
5296 2018-05-24 15:01:55 I have never used gouache. Is it as difficult as oil?

5299 2018-05-24 15:01:43 Sir, on April 1, 2014 when UPA govt was in power, petrol was INR 80.89 today it is INR 82, so hardly any difference. When it was dropped down to INR 63 by NDA govt, no one from UPA appreciated. This is misguiding politics. Look at international crude oil prices for price hike.
5300 2018-05-24 15:01:38 What I’ve been doing for about a week now. Thank God for my oil or I wouldn’t be able to get this far.
5301 2018-05-24 15:01:30 I am thankful that there’s no place for me in your world cause I’ve created my own world. Each and every shit that you did is actually act as the oil that lighten and burn up my soul and spirit to live and to proof that how Strong I am.
5302 2018-05-24 15:01:27 Bhaizaan 2 scenario :
1. Reduce tax and increase pressure on govt and some states whose only source is fuel tax. 
2. Dec. Tax increase demand of oil increase inport debt again fuck the tax and inc. pressure on treasury...

Or like congress empty the treasury and get fucked long.

5317 2018-05-24 15:00:15 Only one solution is in their hands since they cannot control crude oil prices. They have to forego a major portion of excise duty. With subsidy on gas n kerosene increasing, to what extent they will go with elections around the corner is to be seen

5331 2018-05-24 14:58:57 It's oil I have on 
5332 2018-05-24 14:58:45 Indeed, India is largely low yield (though also some premium demand), and AA canceled the route when oil prices were through the roof, which makes sense.

5338 2018-05-24 14:58:23 It can be but reducing taxes worsens our fiscal deficit, weakens the INR and you end up paying even more for the oil we import and all other things we import. Its a vicious cycle, simply cannot afford to incentivize oil consumption.

5358 2018-05-24 14:56:57 Ha ... you should have also shown the direct correlation between unstable War Rhetoric and rising oil prices.... which will make prices go up on everything.... transportation, manufacturing, retail .... it ain't just at the pumps.
5359 2018-05-24 14:56:52 Oil demand growth will peak within the next 25 years & either flatten or slightly decrease as developing economies follow the trends of Western economies. Given reserves already out there, and anticipating new tech, there is zero chance we will run out.

5369 2018-05-24 14:55:57 And climbing-  I do not want to sound condescending but you might be too young to remember gas prices over $4 and oil companies raking in profits.   This is what Republicans do.  Keep tensions high in oil producing countries and cut regulations for fuel efficiency.
5370 2018-05-24 14:55:56 Look at where those conflicts are, Many of those wars were brought to Muslim countries. It's no coincidence that fighting by countries from all over the world is occurring in areas with tons of oil and other resources

How much does the Alberta oil production contribute to Canada's GDP?
How much does the existing KinderMorgan pipeline contribute to Canada's GDP?
How much does it contribute to BC's GDP?
5375 2018-05-24 14:55:36 Good news. Then #Russia can join the #EU and the #NATO, give #Crimea en #Georgia back to the people, dismantle all weapons and become a normal country not supporting  criminal friends like #Turkey, #Syria and #North-Korea. And fight the 100% dependence on oil. Start working
5376 2018-05-24 14:55:35 I am sensitive to perfumes and things like heavy patchouli, but something like lavender essential oil is amazing. It's subtle and lovely and never bothers me.

5380 2018-05-24 14:55:13 . I've lobbied Canadian politicians for revenue neutral carbon pricing & have learned that too many Conservative politicians have buried their heads in the (oil)sand.

5401 2018-05-24 14:53:44 @TandonRaveena mam oil prices are based on mainly two things international crude oil price and USD Vs Rs value. If looking at the data from 2003 to 2008 both these values kept on rising and oil value reached its peak in 2008. At that govt used to take most of the loss 1/n
5402 2018-05-24 14:53:43 My head scalp itches I need oil and a comb to get it out if it comes back
5403 2018-05-24 14:53:41 I generally agree... except for the part about God...I believe in an ultimate efficient cause...when you say God has been taken out of schools... who's got...your God...the only true God...which God? God and oil cause of most wars. Maybe kids should be taught this.
5404 2018-05-24 14:53:40 Yup he is an asshole! How can a country in danger of freezing to death 6 months out of the year! Taxed so heavily, Paying so much for electrical energy that they have decide between it and food? Survive with out oil to heat our homes to drive our economy that is being destroyed!

5406 2018-05-24 14:53:33 Why the long sigh? Many say building Canadian refinery makes no economic sense. They argue BC needs oil, or Canada need oil (which only makes sense if we refine it here) & ignore #bitumen pipeline may not make economic sense either. It's time to build the refinery in Canada

5409 2018-05-24 14:53:17 Well, what does that have to do with making electricity? Why do oil rich Arab nations care about making electricity w controlled fission, the cost of oil to them is as cheap as sand.
5410 2018-05-24 14:53:16 I am sure challenge will be get accepted by @narendramodi ji ,please pay the debts of 51000 cr of oil purchased by INC in 2004-2014. Plus 8000 cr of OROP..

Brexit is a threat and you need to state it will cost jobs. 
There is an unknown to indy but with a strong positive GDP and high oil prices compared to a Tory Brexit costing billions it is far more sensible..
5421 2018-05-24 14:52:27 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
5422 2018-05-24 14:51:53 So oil has so much more supply than demand, yet gas prices are still going up? This is exactly why oil should be put to pasture and every car needs to be electric or some other alternate fuel.
5423 2018-05-24 14:51:48 U fool. First compare with fuel rate per barrel which bought from oil countries. In 2013, 139 doller per barrel and 73 rs per litre but in 2017, only 27 doller per barrel. So irritating
5424 2018-05-24 14:51:26 The one destroying our country is Trump. He is rolling back all environmental protections and selling off our public lands to the mining and oil industries. He is also making us less safe by attacking our allies. He's completely incompetent.

5434 2018-05-24 14:50:47 @BJP4India The immediate solution is to reduce the taxes,at least partially(even then govt.will collect hefty amount).Let’s us remember that taxes were increased surreptitiously when oil prices were down.Also,Bring out the ethanol blending policy from the closet

5462 2018-05-24 14:47:49 Irrational. There is no chance humanity will run out of fossil fuels. The entire concept of "peak oil" is crap. Proven reserves continue to grow, as does the technology to safely access them. Look at the impact fracing had on shale oil.

5479 2018-05-24 14:46:32 Another thing most of our imported oil comes from Canada and not the Mid East

5483 2018-05-24 14:46:19 The oil fund is also a redistribution, JG is a redistribution, if we're going to look into the philosophical aspects of any plan beyond the purely economic. Every plan has an ideological perspective, the idea that present approach is non-ideological is a myth.

5493 2018-05-24 14:44:54 @realDonaldTrump Are you destroying Venusualas ability to export oil in order to allow the U.S. to enter the global oil market without lowering oil prices to much? Now that's what I call a free market. Crony Capitalism.

5498 2018-05-24 14:44:27 Venezuela had more oil than Saudi Arabia but Chavez and Maduro managed to spend the lot - for which they were praised by Corbyn and McDonnell - and now Venezuelan people are reduced to eating their pets. Just because the UK is wealthy doesn't mean it can't go broken by socialism
5499 2018-05-24 14:44:26 I thought you were getting the oil lines done, did you do it yourself?
5500 2018-05-24 14:44:10 The ONLY thing i hate ab getting my oil changed at the dealership is the calls and surveys after. 

Leave me alone. I will see yall in 5,000mi

5502 2018-05-24 14:44:01 You using it damages the earth and causes severe consequences for people who do not have that privilege. Your use of oil is causing the sea to rise and flooding people in Bangladesh out of their homes, hurricanes and forest fires and major floods and species extinction.

5510 2018-05-24 14:43:17 We know how oil and other minerals have benefited other countries. They utilise it for the benefit of all the citizen but not only a few minority group.

5516 2018-05-24 14:42:53 But this isn’t even a reasonable or smart lie, almost anybody with a passing interest in the oil industry knows this isn’t true. I can never understand such statements. I have to assume it’s an honest error, which is only the lesser evil.

5522 2018-05-24 14:42:38 yes oil prices are way too high but that's not a deal breaker.
5523 2018-05-24 14:42:18 US will buy discounted Canadian oil& export theirs  at world prices. Brilliant on their part.
5524 2018-05-24 14:42:17 Russia 5M bpd , Iran 2M bpd oil production.

Russia receiving gold for oil fr. China and Iran moving back to this recent settlement method as used during prior sanctions.

5549 2018-05-24 14:40:20 Underinvestment in oil and gas likely to drive the energy transition in different directions: 

- inadequate investment in oil production> higher gasoline prices > faster adoption of EVs

- inadequate investment in gas production > higher costs for NGCC baseload > higher coal use

5561 2018-05-24 14:39:05 Should we say today the gulf region is running Indian economy?? Cause of oil, India is making money by adding it's own tax and openly accepting that these taxes are used for incentive programs in the country...

5625 2018-05-24 14:33:53 Check the oil level and make sure it hasn't been running low on the trip, then get it looked at asap; there's a chance that the crank bearings could have overheated and created a rod knock, which if not treated immediately will worsen and permanently damage the block.

5643 2018-05-24 14:31:46 This is my thinking exactly. IF we're going to get to worked up over the "deficit", it should be because its a symptom of America's declining manuf competitiveness. selling more oil and beans doesn't change that one bit

5652 2018-05-24 14:30:42 #FuelChallenge BJP comparing 2004 to 2014 but they should consider Crude Oil Prices also
Crude Oil Prices
MAY 2004 - $52.87
MAY 2014 - $108.88 (~206%)
MAY 2018 - $71.9 (~136%)

Petrol prices in Delhi
MAY 2004 - 35.71
MAY 2014 - 71.41(~200%)
MAY 2018 - 77.51(~217%) - Why not 136%?

5750 2018-05-24 14:20:52 Oil prices fluctuated under Obama as well.
5751 2018-05-24 14:20:44 Not like you guys. I opposed then and I oppose now. Petrol was 70/- when crude was 140 dollars and now petrol is 80+ when crude oil is 70 dollars. Have some guts to speak the facts even if it is against the ruling class!!!

5756 2018-05-24 14:20:30 Thank you for this wonderful fundraising opportunity!
5757 2018-05-24 14:20:26 There was a 6.5 billion dollar debt in 2016 to Iran oil companies .. UPA enjoyed and increased fiscal debt with subsidies .. Do you want that to happen now .
5758 2018-05-24 14:20:24 No ! That doesn't make any sense at all !!!! 
I get like a frozen shoulder and it drives me nuts , a few drops ( 5 ) rubbed in topically - WOW within a minute I had almost no pain and 80% more movement and didn't need any more oil for 4 days 
5759 2018-05-24 14:20:19 Good point! Is it the grilled burger or is it the fries cooked in vegetable oil along with the flour-bun and straight up sugar drink biggie sized that goes along with it?
5760 2018-05-24 14:20:18 So at a rough estimate that will be 20MW for 2 days *500 = 480 million KWhrs of electricity generated in the city centre by burning fuel oil! And we wonder why there is such poisonous air near the docks.

5791 2018-05-24 14:17:18 Absolutely would expect more investment for four reasons: (1) strengthening global economy, (2) rising price of oil, (3) Keynesian stimulus and (4) supply-side effects of rates/expensing/intl provisions.

5804 2018-05-24 14:16:50 All the above OMC have their own refineries in India. Ambani didn't own oil wells that he benefits from crude price hike or people price hike. Ambani just does job work of buying crude oil refine it to make petrol/Diesel etc n then add its refining margin n sell back.

5816 2018-05-24 14:15:39 Better to work to decrease the price of oil. Taxes are needed to repair roads and bridges. Oil companies can afford a lower profit margin.
5817 2018-05-24 14:15:37 I really wish people could understand why this is so important. All we have is oil, that is all past governments cared about. It is the only thing we have to fund our present and our future. The faster we get the product to tide the faster we can sell it & make it profitable.

5853 2018-05-24 14:12:46 India's complacency in exploring oil has placed it in perilous situation just as it's lack of determination to take manufacturing and agriculture to next level for export competitiveness ..

5860 2018-05-24 14:12:05 Of course you can blame the oil companies. They are to blame, but it's mainly due to lack of investment. With prices low, they cut back on investment. With increased prices they'll start investing in existing and new fields again. It's a ping pong game.

5862 2018-05-24 14:11:58 The price hike of oil is painful to public. Central & State govt should reduce their tax in this situation.
5863 2018-05-24 14:11:55 RG, you need to grow up and understand the economics of oil prices and CAD before you talk loose like this. While you claim to be ready to be PM of India, (which we doubt any way you will get to) how can we trust you with affairs of nation with such immature threats?

5886 2018-05-24 14:09:30 4 billion annually 2 oil & agriculture, regardless of performance; billions in foreign aid; tax breaks 4 wealthy, but u want 2 quibble over someone's meal. They aren't "freebies" when you've invested. It's called taxation with representation- colonizers fought a war over it...
5887 2018-05-24 14:09:21 Have you ever seen a car company merge with an oil and gas company in its early stages
5888 2018-05-24 14:09:17 Russia and Saudi to discuss relaxing oil production caps...
5889 2018-05-24 14:09:16 へたじゃないよ！

5890 2018-05-24 14:09:14 Do you think they are fried in coconut oil?
5891 2018-05-24 14:09:11 Don't worry about it. if I were as ripped as you, I'd never wear a shirt!  LOL rock on & F the haters!
5892 2018-05-24 14:09:00 #หนึ่งด้าวฟ้าเดียว ฉากวันนี้คงจะสะเทือนใจเกินไปไม่เห็นจิรายุรัวทวิตเลยเว้ยยย
5893 2018-05-24 14:09:00 Haha you are contradicting yourself in your tweet! I just gave you link on how Modi govt is paying if it’s oil debts.. clearly you ignored it for your own good. Besides it was you who brought my location in. Since you live in Delhi talk only about Delhi’s nautanki Govt.  Jalli?
5894 2018-05-24 14:08:56 All due respect to all my oil industry pals, but current pricing is a result of geopolicital instability, not a recovery in underlying supply/demand. Sorry. 
5895 2018-05-24 14:08:50 Haha karena itu oil makanya kamu takut itu jerawatan? You should have to watch Liah Yoo's video.
5896 2018-05-24 14:08:38 sure fire way to make the oil change guys aware that you know absolutely nothing about cars: shrug your shoulders when they ask you to pop the hood
5897 2018-05-24 14:08:32 They got my ass tho paying for the expensive oil.  I told myself to treat this car better than I did my truck. So I listened this time 
5898 2018-05-24 14:08:31 oil Price rise will lead to rising commodity prices, lesser economic activity, more inflation, GDP going to go down, less tax collection, more pressure on BoP . Life becoming tougher, but only hope Sensex keeps growing surpassing all records yielding high returns, can balance

5900 2018-05-24 14:08:18 For a country with such inclusion they have major issues. An unsustainable health system, ask her about pay $ to jump to the head of the line.  A failing economy, rampant drug use in BC and a PM who is insane.  Oil n gas in AB all but shutdown.  Eh.
5901 2018-05-24 14:08:17 They forget to say that today in the margarine are "bad oils" like palm oil and that's not a good effect for the healtyness.
5902 2018-05-24 14:08:08 Might hit Ron & Jo’s after I get this oil change.. 
5903 2018-05-24 14:08:06 Uyy wagg jeriel munaaa hahahaha tapos baby oil whahaha
5904 2018-05-24 14:08:01 Based on stat, for 16yrs of PDP, Nigeria realized $809,055b from crude oil sales out of which, they saved a meagre $27.8b 

Average sale of 2.3m bpd @$61.07
Per day,  2.3 x 61.07= $140.461m
Per month 140.461 x 30=$4,213.83  Each year 4,213 x 12= $50,565.95
5905 2018-05-24 14:08:00 China is the world’s top importer of both oil and soy, and more U.S. shipments will help it meet rising domestic consumption. The imports would also contribute to cutting China’s trade surplus with the United States, as demanded by Trump.
5906 2018-05-24 14:07:56 At that time crude oil price was very high, but it is reduced now so bring down the prices now.
5907 2018-05-24 14:07:53 Yuppp. And the maintenance they do they get paid , because you pay for the rent of the oil rig and you pay their staff as well . The money is just too much . You need to invest big
5908 2018-05-24 14:07:51 i be thinking my whip a lambo when i get the oil changed 
5909 2018-05-24 14:07:49 furnace and recently solar, but I view oil as the only viable fuel for heavy truck/equipment and aircraft so why not get dthe biggest tax value for petroleum we can until the market for it ends
5910 2018-05-24 14:07:46 Mr. USA They are so bad that they left us the third best oil industry on the planet and the CHAVISTA DESTROYED it Laundering MONEY from the CONTRABAND of drugs, gold and other MINERALS Now only the HUNGER and MISERY remains

5914 2018-05-24 14:07:31 reducing the excise duty is best way to ease the situation which ur govt shameless has incresed 10+ times since 2014 so that consumer dont get benefit of low crude oil prices.. instead of doing drama over GST reduce the excise to initial rate.
5915 2018-05-24 14:07:21 There's oil in them thar hills, right?
5916 2018-05-24 14:07:18 He’ll lay all the coins out on his big boy bed and roll naked covered in oil on them!
5917 2018-05-24 14:07:16 i feel like it’s only right you teach your sons and daughters how to fend for themselves where the opposite sex plays a role. ie: teaching your sons how to cook or wash clothes, daughters how to change a tire or oil, etc. that way they never need to rely on anybody for anything.
5918 2018-05-24 14:07:13 Mam, oil price can't be controlled until and unless it comes under GST. Now, GOI and all state Govt has to sit down to find out the solution as some States still doesn't agree to put the oil under GST, it'll hamper their revenue. Everyone needs a solution for it.
5919 2018-05-24 14:07:05 Sounds like those German potato pancakes. I showed them to you, right? It is shredded potato, onion, flower, spices and water. And then you cook 'em in oil. And you can eat them sweet or savory (commonly with gulash).
5920 2018-05-24 14:07:04 Nice chart, speaks volumes!. US operates a base at the South Pole, which conveniently straddles every territorial claimWe are so badass China has five bases. And there is far more OIL there than Kuwait & UAE. Antartica...power, untapped resources and global control.
5921 2018-05-24 14:06:59 they said “it’s just an oil” YALL NASTY LIARS

5924 2018-05-24 14:06:48 Still searching... How come a govt of a country so big runs without backup plan.... Do we have strategic oil Reserve or some thing??? Sale ban ne regional power.....
5925 2018-05-24 14:06:47 Now maybe he can get his "back channel" to Russia and if he is lucky either the Russians or the oil shieks who financed the terrorists who caused 911 will loan this twerp the money to bail out the white elephant bldg. he bought.
5926 2018-05-24 14:06:47 he never cut Re 1 frm govt entitlements Central Excise, Customs and now Rs 25?A huge cut will spiral the mega oil import bill.
5927 2018-05-24 14:06:40 Bros, a journey of thousand miles begins with a step. @MBuhari has taken that giant step and its yielding result already even with little resources at his disposals. What did your hero do with the oil boom? He basterdized our economy by turning it to an import based one
5928 2018-05-24 14:06:37 I fultoned everyone in a base and then started blowing up oil barrels n Ari was just like
Why. Why are you doing this.
I’m pretty sure I shouted violence for violence is the rule of the beasts but I cannot remember

5931 2018-05-24 14:06:23 US democracy is broken. We are working our asses off to make progressive gains to undo the damage. Our Congress is bought by oil interests (some of them from north of us) and is completely ineffectual. We no longer have a representative democracy. This is an authoritarian regime.
5932 2018-05-24 14:06:21 I wonder if in 30 years time kids will be like "If you eat enough CBD oil it gets you high" ?
5933 2018-05-24 14:06:21 Abe bhosdike tab crude oil ka price ab se 3 gunah zyada tha samaj baat ko
5934 2018-05-24 14:06:21 Blue magic was all we ever used lol. To blend my leave out now I just use argan or coconut oil. My hair is weird though so I don’t be knowing what to do with it lol
5935 2018-05-24 14:06:08 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.

5937 2018-05-24 14:06:05 Why did you didn't pay 7 billion debt to Iran on oil imports? What happened to that money?

5955 2018-05-24 14:04:08 In #oklahoma the @gop gave $490m in tax breaks to oil and gas corps because tax cuts “create jobs” well they got $9m over four years and it cost the tax payers $481m in taxes to those corps over that four years to waste $481m to make just $9 million #OktaxScams #goptaxScams
5956 2018-05-24 14:03:54 $USDCAD #USDCAD Singapore Summit cancelled. Oil spiking over $71 as a result. #dollar falling. This is holding near 1.29. Hmmm. 1.26 or below soon.

5958 2018-05-24 14:03:48 Just like foreign oil coming into st. Lawrence seaway and no Energy east pipeline... surround by stupidity
5959 2018-05-24 14:03:47 It won’t take 100 years. If Trudeau wins in 2019, AB and Sask will be gone. It’s already being worked on. With how he’s destroyed the oil sector and crushed the AB economy, the momentum to leave is at an all time high. Trudeau’s legacy will be the complete destruction of Canada

5961 2018-05-24 14:03:44 Snake Oil dear boy, a cottage industry predicated on fear, and frankly, utter bollocks. 

I'm sure that some systems needed updating, but there were not worldwide crashes of systems predicted. There were a few but very minor problems.
5962 2018-05-24 14:03:32 hey modi ke andhe bhakt..jara Crude oil ka rate bhi dekh lo pehle kitne the ab kitne hue...dekh nahi paoge..andhe bhakt jo ho...Congress ke samye crude oil 115 usd tak chala gaya tha, or aapke fenku modi ke samay ye 35 usd tak gir gaya tha.... ab kon kya daal raha hai khud socho
5963 2018-05-24 14:03:20 So apparently "We want fair and free trade" and "You cannot buy oil from anyone that wants to sell it to you in CNY" are NOT compatible positions in the eyes of the Chinese.  #DoAsWeSayNotAsWeDo

5980 2018-05-24 14:02:43 Similar to the tragic case of the U'Was tribe in Colombia.
When the oil company Ecopetrol moved into their sacred lands, the whole tribe threatened with a collective suicide pact (5000 members).
The prospected oil site has been relented. The fight continues.

5994 2018-05-24 14:01:42 Again, that's been the whole end goal for Tesla, but if you haven't noticed Big Oil will do what it can to bury renewable energy. Had they tried to go for the mass market car straight away they'd go bankrupt.
5995 2018-05-24 14:01:38 Thats because back then I'll exploration companies like ONGC n OIL were footing the excess crude prices. These govt run companies were made to bleed their profits. Same is being again explored now. Until 2014 both these companies used to absorb upto 40% subsidies given to public

6010 2018-05-24 14:00:05 If any Bhakt tells you “atleast NDA Govt maintained a low fiscal deficit in four years”, remind them that crude oil prices fell to as low as $28 per barrel in last four years.

It’s like claiming that wet nahi huye kyuki barish nahi huyi

6012 2018-05-24 13:59:53 #Windfalltax to be levied on #upstream companies. To have limited impact given less than 1/5th share in total oil consumption. Focus on increasing #oil production and rationalization of taxes crucial.
6013 2018-05-24 13:59:52 I have a locally owned oil change/car wash place I go to when the weather is shitty and I need an oil change, local shop for any work I can’t do, everything else happens in the driveway.
6014 2018-05-24 13:59:49 I remember people predicting the end of oil in the 1970s. Its ironic that the Trudeau family fortune is based on a gas station empire, considering how little Pierre or Justin know about oil.
6015 2018-05-24 13:59:46 I want 1st world problems.

"Seriously, Jeff?" (my chauffeur)
Now I must travel to my airport in the Black Range Rover because you forgot to get the oil & tiers of the Mercedes GLE Coupè changed! You know they get changed after each ride." 
"Is the jet even ready for takeoff?"

6020 2018-05-24 13:59:20 Gosh. What a complete mess.

I must say, I've never understood why there is so much corruption in Kenya. In Nigeria we have oil, and that tends to breed corruption wherever you find it. But Kenya I don't get.
6021 2018-05-24 13:59:20 I’m talking about those in the service or primary sector. A lot indigenous companies can’t fund operations to drill oil and maintain oil rigs. Billionaires who have oil blocks and wellls normally have to partner with foreign companies . Stuff is too expensive
6022 2018-05-24 13:59:13 Playing a word game n I’m giving Mark hints so I go ‘it’s in a pen. What’s in a pen?’

6025 2018-05-24 13:59:03 Agree, thanks. Is there anyone with good scenarios of how that transition might unfold? Would need to include rapid decarbonization and slower pathways, and different types of responses in #MiddleEast& other oil- and gas-producing countries to diversify/decarbonize. Ownership key
6026 2018-05-24 13:59:03 Post independence the oil will belong to Scotland, or are you disputing that?
English companies will be welcome to extract it on payment of appropriate fees to the Scottish government.

6033 2018-05-24 13:58:12 In my opinion fuel price raises from crude oil to customers reach and that is how it works, taxes and vats are ok but it depend actual price of crude oil we export and import and the whole price also, it vary from day to day. Its long way to calculate but it is too costly for us
6034 2018-05-24 13:58:05 If I don't have time to do an oil change, I'll hit a local chain or if there's a manufacturer's warranty I'll take to the dealer. Beyond that, local shops are the way to go.

6037 2018-05-24 13:57:37 Because Muskrat Falls and oil exploitation in conservation zones and a &@#%ed up fishery and inappropriate behaviour in the House of Assembly are so last week. Let’s fight about 30 minutes.
6038 2018-05-24 13:57:24 One should also ask whether alt-health is a long-term, sustainable solution to the present crisis.

Snake oil salesmen aren't bad because they're selling something that's harmful. They're bad because they exploit people's hopes but can't deliver on their promises.
6039 2018-05-24 13:57:18 @jamieoliver You are at it again annoying the crap out of everyone, putting olive oil on your body to stay youthful,get real and go away and give us a break , the face moisturiser is not working.

6041 2018-05-24 13:57:11 High oil prices due to cut production to Iran's sanctions are mitigated by dovish comments by FED. One is a fact, the other is just words on the air.
6042 2018-05-24 13:57:03 Cnooc foresees start of Uganda's Kingfisher oil field in 2021
6043 2018-05-24 13:57:02 Then of course there's the fact that foundation/basement excavation has the most unpredictable timeline because when you start digging, who knows what you'll find?  Huge rocks?  Something that needs mitigation like a buried fuel oil tank?  Worst tree roots ever? Random utilities?
6044 2018-05-24 13:57:01 Theraflu with coconut oil. It’s basically Tylenol and should be safe, double check, but the coconut oil is for sure.

6058 2018-05-24 13:55:32 I didn't day 99%. I said 80%. Store bought bread doesn't have nutrients.

I didn't say eating only fat won't make you fat either. If you eat lots of deep fried food in vegetable oil, you'll get fat as fuck.
6059 2018-05-24 13:55:26 Nearly one third of African countries are oil, gas producers and many other minerals. Africa is not poor, but Africans are poor. That is the paradox of our continent, which Agenda 2063 is trying to resolve. #AfricaDay
6060 2018-05-24 13:55:25 And the downturn in 2015-2015 was largely attributable to, if I recall, significant overproduction of oil by certain major world producers, causing oil prices to crash, couple with Wilde fire devastation in the oil patch. How’s the AB NDP to blame for that exactly?
6061 2018-05-24 13:55:23 Oooh puns... "Mary had a little watch. She swallowed it one day. She drank a bottle of Castor Oil to pass the time away!"

Just my 2 cents.
6065 2018-05-24 13:55:04 Why are you hiding crude oil price ??? Lol
6066 2018-05-24 13:55:00 Do something about the gas prices. Any money I received is going right into my gas tank. Heavily invested in oil like the president. Rich getting richer off our hard working backs. Won't vote republican again as an independent
6067 2018-05-24 13:55:00 I've been lucky enough to have flown both.... I have to go for the 146. 5 oil leaks connected by an electrical fault.
6068 2018-05-24 13:55:00 You are lying to Canadians. The price of gas is a global issue Andrew! But can you explain how the price of gas is the same today as when the baril of oil was selling for $150, but its selling for $72. Who is pocketing all this money?

6084 2018-05-24 13:53:30 No! Ha! Just some random oil! I am going to order from my girl but that means I have to call her and talk. I DONT WANT TO!
6085 2018-05-24 13:53:28 It's literally, dipping it in the batter and dump it in a pan with oil to deep fry it for 1-2 minute. it's DONE its like SUPER EASY.
6086 2018-05-24 13:53:20 Not a myth.   The only countries significantly above the US are small tax havens, or small oil rich countries.
The more successful European countries are keeping pace though, but they essentially share the same system as the US.
6087 2018-05-24 13:53:19 Oil you smoke that gets you the same effect of. It’s stronger and pure!

6094 2018-05-24 13:52:41 Sir first try to understand the present oil market and think of agitation etc.don't try to mix up things. Modiji is saying about health and  you can comment on that.
6095 2018-05-24 13:52:39 From MPC meeting: Next move in rates will be up. Their model implies a 0.25% increase at end of year, similar move in 2019 and 2 moves in 2020. Interesting was view on oil. Futures mkt & consensus point to moderating prices. Average of $70 in 2018 and $67 in 2019 and 2020.

6100 2018-05-24 13:52:26 Gulf Oil had that same strategy... going all in )in Africa) when other majors tightened their belts. They found oil. SoCal found them. And in 1981 bought them out.
6101 2018-05-24 13:52:26 Which God Mr Bushiri? God of substances? eg, oil,water and images?. Or our heavenly God?
6102 2018-05-24 13:52:14 No. Canadian taxpayers are "held hostage" by the @BCGreens and by foreign funded groups that want to keep AB oil landlocked.

6135 2018-05-24 13:49:57 I’m so sorry to hear! Try heating your feet (a heating pad works, but I like a hot foot bath with peppermint) while you ice your head - it pulls the circulation away and can relieve. Drink stupid amounts of water if you can manage it. I use peppermint essential oil under my nose.
6136 2018-05-24 13:49:56 And the province gives subsidies to oil and gas, so the carbon tax helps pay for that.
6137 2018-05-24 13:49:52 Another reason is that like Russia, Oil makes up a huge portion of its economy.  With oil prices being so low (relatively) it effects their economy much more than a more diversified economy like the US.  When oil prices rise (as the trend is now) their economy will rise with it.

6147 2018-05-24 13:49:02 would it not be of value to refine the oil for local market and reduce the imports?
6148 2018-05-24 13:48:57 hope they don’t be all long with this oil change.
6149 2018-05-24 13:48:55 I find it is funny that #ScaledAgileFramework tries to look more like CD / DevOps with each release.

6166 2018-05-24 13:47:27 I hope it works for you friend. Feel better soon. If you need an oil dealer I know a couple.
6167 2018-05-24 13:47:26 The stuff that the oil goes into, that you use with you vape pen. the labeling, all that. Not easy to get into. They have 5000 customers already. Not cheap. 20 times sales. Very long time horizon here.
6168 2018-05-24 13:47:25 The oil rally is likely done. The move in place since WTI bottomed at $26 in 2016 is now complete. Oil will go to lower lows & probably bottom around $10 next year as a global downturn hits demand very hard.
6169 2018-05-24 13:47:24 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

6171 2018-05-24 13:47:19 Petrol Diesel prices in our country are totally dependent on the international crude oil prices which crude oil we import in substantial quantity for production of Petrol, Deisel etc from our refineries
6172 2018-05-24 13:47:15 Avoiding getting an oil change? We suggest that you do regular oil changes to prolong the life of your engine. We can replace your oil, filter and lube based on the season and your manufacturer’s recommendations.

6183 2018-05-24 13:46:26 Actual reason is that little refining is done in Canada, most of our oil and gas is exported to the US to be refined into end products and then imported back into Canada for consumption. That costs us a consistent premium at the pumps.

6193 2018-05-24 13:45:54 But then you lose out on the biggest savings: maintenance. When your remove the ICE engine, you remove the transmission, cooling system, oil, etc etc all those systems go away and your lifetime total cost of ownership drops. Gas is only tiny part of the picture.
6194 2018-05-24 13:45:54 Didn't these idiots $BP say two years ago that oil wasn't going to 70$? Lower for longer crap.

6200 2018-05-24 13:45:09 Dear @michaelgove,  Water Co's leaking a volume of water equivalent to the daily usage of 20m households is outrageous. If they were piping gas or oil there would be ZERO leakage. Getting their commodity for FREE is the basis of their indifference. Penalise leakage at 1p per ltr.

6273 2018-05-24 13:39:47 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
6274 2018-05-24 13:39:38 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
6275 2018-05-24 13:39:38 If I had a car, I'd get my oil changed there... and I usually change my own oil.

#UniversalCredit is like an oil tanker barrelling it's way towards an iceberg.

It's a disaster happening in slow motion, one the rest of us clearly see happening, but the #Tories and #DWP at the helm of the ship itself seem to be utterly oblivious to.
6278 2018-05-24 13:39:13 I've always used linseed oil. Never knew abt walnut! Have to give it a whirl.
6279 2018-05-24 13:39:07 literally just bought ingredients to make some at home. So yes. 3 spoons of warm oil here I come...
6280 2018-05-24 13:38:53 I think you are right. And then Trump traded the oil for gold.
6281 2018-05-24 13:38:49 Lol my mom got my CBD oil for my birthday #what 
6282 2018-05-24 13:38:45 Assuming you have store cupboard basics, I suggest baba ghanoush, roasted veg and some quick stovetop flatbread with lots of pepper and garlic oil. You could always do mushy peas as well if you insisted
6283 2018-05-24 13:38:42 that is right..OPEC was threatened by frackers..they kept the price artificially low.  the price of oil is rising and with it the cost of consumer goods like food..with the rise in the cost of goods, disposable income drops..that slows the economy..
6284 2018-05-24 13:38:39 I love eating crisps outside in the sun, the oil makes them glitter and it's ok to make crumbs.
6285 2018-05-24 13:38:34 the real tesla was trying to tell us years ago. there is a abundance of energy in every square foot of air that surrounds us we just need to tap into it.  "Electric power is everywhere, present in unlimited quantities and can drive the words machinery without coal,gas and oil"
6286 2018-05-24 13:38:19 What congress can do to reduce the cost of petrol when the market price of oil in the global market is so high?
6287 2018-05-24 13:38:14 What's riposte and I've only got one oil urn and one Molotov left lmaooo do or die rn yo
6288 2018-05-24 13:38:07 Overrated, washed up actor desperately claws at relevance.  Film at 11.
6289 2018-05-24 13:38:06 UK is country of 4 nations. Oil is in British waters with last reserves being tapped by British & Dutch companies. No Scottish only xenophobic companies banning “foreign” English scum involved as far as I know?

6299 2018-05-24 13:37:36 wait I thought the oil came from his sword
6300 2018-05-24 13:37:28 Always saying this, but this government will challege it's own survival since they are from two different extreme political views. Like mixing oil & vinegar. In Italia governments last very short. I think I'll go to vote again soon.
6301 2018-05-24 13:37:20 Fresh made Body Scrubs with exfoliating #Australianseasalt , and Coconut oil and Grape seed oil to hydrate and soothe #Summerskin fresh florals and #Novascotiaseaweed to detoxify with #OCEANSALT Scrub come in to #WHOLEFOODSMARKETOAKVILLE and scoop some scrub!
6302 2018-05-24 13:37:05 Apple cider vinegar with a little water as your toner twice daily, if your skin is oily you need an oil free moisturizer because ACV will dry your skin out. if you’re gonna use black soap I recommend getting the AUTHENTIC RAW black soap, it isn’t black it’s brown but it strong!
6303 2018-05-24 13:37:00 I’ve been sitting in a waiting room for an hour while I get my oil changed and man. Daytime TV is WEIRD. We switched to streaming services a few years back but apparently we’ve been really missing out on all these daytime teen dramas. 

...Nah, I’m good actually 
6304 2018-05-24 13:36:58 Saudi Arabia needs an oil price between 115 and 140USD ... what many people don't know is that in Saudi Arabia the "gouverment" has huge social security spendings and no tax income... they have a huge deficit ..nearly impossible to get even.. that's another reason for the purge.
6305 2018-05-24 13:36:50 Do you know the site of the first Middle East oil drilling and pumping in 1905? This may be a brain teaser for some. 
6306 2018-05-24 13:36:50 I been oil cleansing my face for about 6 months now. Love the way it makes my skin feel.
6307 2018-05-24 13:36:48 Ok its time to open up Texas and Gulf oil and also Alaska's oil.  You have prepared the way for it President Trump. Lets start getting cheaper gas prices here in the states and selling our over flow to other countries.

6310 2018-05-24 13:36:29 Also the book that originally was There Will Be Blood, called Oil! Again written in the '20s might be a good read. These are a couple of books I'm always looking to track down.
6311 2018-05-24 13:35:59 Stop playing dumb. Big oil backs BEV because they know hydrogen will put them out of business and BEV can’t.
6312 2018-05-24 13:35:59 Oil
6313 2018-05-24 13:35:52 Right now, someone in government is doing a web search for "PM10 air filters for large buildings". Anything to keep the oil burning.
6314 2018-05-24 13:35:50 are you trying to make fool of readers as no one has forgotten oil price from 2004 till 2014
6315 2018-05-24 13:35:46 It’s a result of our govt’s serving the corporations instead of their citizenship. The oil sands are mostly foreign owned. They throw us crumbs. Notley should raise the royalties instead of saying there won’t be enough money for hospitals etc.
6316 2018-05-24 13:35:38 How can we be claiming advanced technology today when we are still using oil for fuel used more than a hundred years ago?
6317 2018-05-24 13:35:33 Just mean on the housing - same as we watch the oil and gas reports - important clues

6323 2018-05-24 13:35:07 Well I still call it Oil of Ulay so that proves you’re younger than me.
6324 2018-05-24 13:35:06 You get oil for head 
6325 2018-05-24 13:34:59 Top 4 US coal producers lost 99% of their value in 5 years.

Coal is a dead letter. It exists on legacy plants & the fact that it's really cheap to store in heaps in existing bins.

Oil & gas are the dead letter no one has uttered yet.
6326 2018-05-24 13:34:56 The economic boom was world wide, you know they had boom time in USA as well? I remember at the time it was all about the USA influence, price of oil etc. the EU never even hit the radar.
6327 2018-05-24 13:34:55 El "peak oil", el parámetro que calcula como un punto en un Gauss el momento en que el decrecimiento de la oferta de hidrocarburos sea posiblemente sustituida por otras fuentes está calculado a +/- 40 años. Hay hidrocarburos para rato y las fuentes alternas les falta mucho...
6328 2018-05-24 13:34:55 Yooo and some oil
6329 2018-05-24 13:34:52 Once you remove it from heat, you can add essential oil, mix, then continue to store as OT mentioned

6335 2018-05-24 13:34:11 Then give the North Korean an offer which is difficult for them to turn down.

Give them food and oil supplies annually.

6357 2018-05-24 13:32:02 Does this factor in that they will start buying Iranian oil with Euros instead of Dollar? 
Cus, if so, how much will a f'n dollar be worth? 15k bitcoins sound supernice, but not if they cost that much because the dollar has halved in price. :) peace and coke
6358 2018-05-24 13:31:53 Virat bhai this is tactics to divert current scenario of oil price.

6367 2018-05-24 13:30:43 1. Modi Govt used low oil price benefit to augment infra n reducing fiscal deficit using the benefit into capital asset formation, not meeting  revenue deficit. 

2. Less traffic on road, less pollution, less imports of fossil fuel, less f/exchange outgoing - the whole cycle.

If you can't control don't give excuses.
Excise duty increased instead of passing on benefits to customers while crude oil prices were declining.
Atleast that should be roll back.
In last GST council meeting, not single word of  Petrol/Diesel prices discussed.
6384 2018-05-24 13:29:10 Oil and fx by far most volatile and noisiest from my experience.

6411 2018-05-24 13:26:11 Time for another dandi March.... When britishers employed tax on salt the  gandhiji resisted it.... The modern british @narendramodi govt.

6417 2018-05-24 13:25:36 Klein balanced the budget off of surging oil & gas royalties, slashed services & infrastructure spending, then sold crown corps, gutted taxes & royalty revenue before stepping down and leaving his disastrous mess for others to deal with. Province has had deficits ever since.

6426 2018-05-24 13:24:29 It is due to circumstances in intn'l market, value of Indian Rupee has  reduced in comparison to Dollar & there has been surge in oil  prices. We are trying to control prices. #GST is one way to ease  situation, other ways also being thought of: @dpradhanbjp on fuel price hike
6427 2018-05-24 13:24:14 Might be a couple of errors in this story, one being that Citgo, since 1990, is no longer an American company but is the national (government owned and operated) oil company of Venezuela.

6429 2018-05-24 13:23:59 Same can be said for crude oil, +nearly 100% since early 2016 (oil path tracking Fed hiking cycle), only a handful of CL bull moves of similar rate of change scope over past 40 years.

6460 2018-05-24 13:21:14 Yes. Arming Ukraine, dominating oil production, bombing Syria, and working with Saudi Arabia on arms deal is sooooo what Putin would want. Lol

6488 2018-05-24 13:18:55 Can anyone explain how cannabis oils will be taxed by the proposed excise tax? My LP considers their CBD Oil (40ml@1/20 ratio) to be = 5g product, so will that $5 more? Will it depend on potency? Will Tilrays new 2/100 CBD product be $20 more? On top of the $390+HST?
6489 2018-05-24 13:18:52 What a tragedy.  People in Turkey are great, and the country could really show the Middle East what freedom and prosperity look like in a Muslim majority country without massive oil wealth.  Suffering for the benefit of a despot.

6547 2018-05-24 13:14:12 I love... Dark chocolate. Honey. Apple cider vinegar. Turmeric. Pumpkin seeds. Almonds. Coconut oil. Parsley. Spinach.

6550 2018-05-24 13:13:50 It’s like painting. You’ll get used to it. One way to approach it is just put down your color, add a new layer, build up your color. Very much if you were using oil or acrylic, but with no limits on how often you can layer. Keep at it. You’ll be fine.
6551 2018-05-24 13:13:37 Me personally, keep it moisturized with vitamin E, olive oil, jahoba oil, etc and leave it alone. I don’t really agree with all the products because they make your hair heavy and my unpopular opinion is products don’t make your hair grow. It just keeps it soft and smelling good

6567 2018-05-24 13:12:43 It is becoming clear that the true basis of any economic empowerment initiative by the state and its agents is to plunder funds. Next time we could as well either rubbish the idea or RUN!! Next... Big 4 agenda, early oil pilot scheme, Cuban doctors.....
6568 2018-05-24 13:12:34 No that is not the issue. When new technology is available it is usually reported on unfairly because people are afraid of it.

Not to mention oil companies and gas powered cars pay for most of the advertising.

Why wouldn't they report unfairly towards Tesla?

6577 2018-05-24 13:12:04 Certainly supermarket prices tend to be lower than average prices, but the higher wholesale fuel prices - mostly as a result of the higher oil price - means everyone who buys fuel, including retailers, are paying more

6588 2018-05-24 13:11:14 Take some profits on oil stocks and maybe play the downside.

6599 2018-05-24 13:10:13 Oil companies do what they call continuous operations, or 24-7 around the clock until completion. ZN is doing 8-10 hour operations and taking off for Sabbath rest on Saturday. I recall Chick-Fil-A doing something similar.

6615 2018-05-24 13:09:21 Petroleum price decided as per Crude oil price in International market and this System is made by UPA. No public to follow ur agitation.
6616 2018-05-24 13:09:20 @PMOIndia @nitin_gadkari when govt purchased fuel at low price, price not reduced. Now purchasing at high, u will not reduce price. So, when will u give relief on oil to public? Same thing happened during UPA, u we're shouting, at the both cheating public
6617 2018-05-24 13:09:15 I went to sleep last night in 2018, and seem to have woken up in 2014. Twitter full of transcendence, oil bonuses and currency-uncertainty. You can tell there's a conference coming - it's like 'barkers' announcing an upcoming Roman circus.
6618 2018-05-24 13:09:14 Hike in oil price is depends upon the price of crude oil in international market and the exchange value of rupees against dollars. Neither You nor any one can do anything.
6619 2018-05-24 13:09:12 Wow, you go look online and find me the oil company that receives tax dollars. Do understand why milk would be ten a gallon if government subsides ended. The subsides make it so little guys can't come in and compete so we now to milk farm with 10,000 cows standing on a big wheel

6623 2018-05-24 13:09:06 Mexico expropriated our oil companies in 1930s.  Much of EU & Japan waged war against us.  They may be "allies" at this time but the world changes. Mexico about to elect a strong nationalist.  Japan gets away with protecting its rice production on national security grounds.
6624 2018-05-24 13:09:06 The #softwaredevelopment industry is build on science and logic but is unable to apply science and logic to call out all the snake oil vendors proliferating within. From #Agile processes to technology choices or practices. We take it in without questions.
6625 2018-05-24 13:09:04 I know what it means. Contrasting the minor damage of oil spills with the massive damage from raw sewage dumping is not conflating them into one idea. They are separate.
6626 2018-05-24 13:08:59 i’m always terrified of getting my oil changed bc i’m afraid when i do they’ll find something else wrong with my car

6630 2018-05-24 13:08:12 Never said i was dripping in oil, it was @JideWestwood that brought oil up... Its dripping in juice. 
6631 2018-05-24 13:08:11 एक तीर, दो शिकार. They want you to give up on automobile and become so fit enough that you can use legs instead crude oil, ultimately ppl will stop complaining about fuel hike

6633 2018-05-24 13:08:05 Iran's crude oil exports to European Union countries in the first four months of the year reached a total of 66.5 million barrels, or nearly 560,000 barrels per day,  more than six times higher than those in the corresponding period last year. The cost saving Eur over $ massive.
6634 2018-05-24 13:08:05 @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp @AmitShah @PMOIndia  In the name of price rise, Oil companies are profiteering. Indian Oil profit before & after tax for the last 3 years in crores. 31.03.18(32564/21346), 31.03.17(26321/19106), 31.03.16(15839/10399). Thus price can be reduced easily.

6643 2018-05-24 13:07:13 3. If petrol prices are hiked, then PM is blamed. Even educated fools in India does this. They can't check Google that Crude oil prices have increased as the production of crude oil has been reduced. #growup

6650 2018-05-24 13:06:54 Oil prices continue to go up and the government wants to remove excise tax if oil reaches $80/barrel. What a time to jump in on oil company stocks.

6656 2018-05-24 13:06:28 I read earlier this week; the pipeline from? Going to Washington state refinery was looking for buyer. Why is it now we can not properly maintain or budget oil in our own country. Plus ruining livelihoods by jailing citizens of u.s.a.
6657 2018-05-24 13:06:18 I dream of a world where fossil fuel has no demand. Thus, every single oil producing country can go fuck themselves. Starting by my own, because oil is the reason why Venezuela is a failed state.
6658 2018-05-24 13:06:18 DUDE if you had listened to REALville ,you would have FIRED anyone who SMELLED like the Manchurian President's appointee ON DAY ONE !

6660 2018-05-24 13:06:07 Release some $ from Deccan, coal & also from loot account of Maino (12th richest politician), is enough to bring fuel charges down.
You dint even paid the crude oil supplier countries during your 10yr loot..
My simple challenge for you, Tell the country that you are not on bail..
6661 2018-05-24 13:06:06 That's because Mickey is a BS artist. He's incompetent and should be fired. He was a snake oil salesman. He said the right things to win over NY and then does none of them, just like Sandy and the Wilpons, by the way.

6673 2018-05-24 13:04:41 It's most likely due to cannabis oil advertisements.  At least, that's what the followers with thinking faculties still in tact are thinking.

6676 2018-05-24 13:04:28 Dr. Chioma Nwachuku said, "As oil independent Nation, are we going to do 'catch-up' in the years when cars stop using petrol. We need to be a lot more proactive", at the #LagosPRWeek lecture. @hembabubba @LagosNIPR1
6677 2018-05-24 13:04:26 He’s right. Very different process to make them. With cup cakes you cream the butter (with more sugar). Muffin batter is also left lumpy for a denser texture. Muffins will often use oil instead of butter (and will have a lot less sugar). Cupcake vs muffin is like cake vs bread.
6678 2018-05-24 13:04:19 Very correct sir. In fact any increase in crude oil prices bring in more revenues to central and state governments. Why should government profit on high prices. Hope Modi ji pays attention to your valuable advice.

6681 2018-05-24 13:03:51 On the global front, crude oil prices fell on expectations that OPEC  members will increase production following concerns over supply from  Venezuela and Iran. Brent crude futures declined a percent to $79 a  barrel.
6682 2018-05-24 13:03:46 Hi, @trevortombe 

as usual, leaning on your excellent research.

Has it been clearly established that potentially selling more oil directly to world markets via the Trans Mountain expansion would actually get Canada higher prices for its oil? 

thanks
6683 2018-05-24 13:03:32 But during 2014-2018 ..in international market oil prices drops..still we can see increases in local prices...
6684 2018-05-24 13:03:29 No, you are wrong. The oil barrel price has been down the past few years due to over pumping by Saudi Arabia which was being done by them to drive the barrel price below $70 which is the break even point for American Frackers, the same ones making American Energy Independent.
6685 2018-05-24 13:03:23 Nangalampag sa tanggapan ng isang oil company ang grupong Piston para kondenahin ang patuloy na pagtaas ng presyo ng produktong petrolyo. Hiling nila, hindi fare hike kundi pagbaba sa presyo ng langis. May report si @oscaroida
6686 2018-05-24 13:03:22 lmao gotta find the oil based and its on. 
6687 2018-05-24 13:03:20 Jet Airways Ltd: Jet Airways hit a fresh 52-week low of Rs 376.60 on the  BSE after the airliner reported a standalone net loss of Rs 1,036 crore  in the March quarter due to rise in oil prices and a weaker rupee. The  stock closed 7 percent lower at Rs 391.55.

おかえりなさい
6689 2018-05-24 13:03:01 @office0ffRG_ Sir, was there no increase in oil prices during UPA? Was everyone suitability employed and there was no law and order problem during the UPA period?
6690 2018-05-24 13:02:58 Changing oil is something many drivers do at home. But if you don't feel comfortable doing that, always take it to a professional.
6691 2018-05-24 13:02:52 31 is the price of crude oil. It has to be processed and refined to create fuel for engines. But I don't expect you to respond to this data as it will beat your agenda and ignorance.
As for your handle, now I know how far out your brain has gone from your skull.

6701 2018-05-24 13:01:59 The government may levy a windfall tax on oil producers as part of a  permanent solution it is working on for moderating the spiraling retail  prices of petrol and diesel.
6702 2018-05-24 13:01:55 My skin is a TRUE struggle. But tumeric masks, chemical exfoliants, lemon water, tea tree oil, aloe and spf have been working as hard as they can for me
6703 2018-05-24 13:01:51 I think extra virgin olive oil might be the most delicious thing. It is so delicious.
6704 2018-05-24 13:01:50 ONGC: Share price of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) slipped 4.5  percent on Thursday as a government to consider levy of tax on oil  producers to control the prices of petrol and diesel. The stock slipped  11.4 percent in intraday trade.
6705 2018-05-24 13:01:31 Someone asked me last week if we carried cbd oil. Ummmm, no.
6706 2018-05-24 13:01:27 “The market managed to end higher in a volatile trading session, taking  cues from dovish Fed minutes and softening of crude oil prices. Besides,  the report stating considerable rise in direct tax collection in the  last financial year further boosted the sentiment,”
6707 2018-05-24 13:01:14 Girl I get so much grief for not being in love with Cantu or coconut oil. They both break my hair too and coconut oils drys out my skin. I’ve been lucky with Shea carrot and olive oils.

6710 2018-05-24 13:01:00 Frankly, Musk has been the best thing to happen to big oil. Why? Because they have to take his innovations as a threat to big oil’s dominance in the energy game whether they pan out or not. Forcing big oil’s diversification to “big energy” is the disruption.
6711 2018-05-24 13:00:59 Also lets not forget the payment of huge Oil Debt to Iran which was raked up during the tenure of @RahulGandhi jis UPA & settled now by NDA
6712 2018-05-24 13:00:52 @TradersCom @ThePitBoss16 @TheDomino sure looks like #oil via $USO and $XOP are going to take a small hit today because technical shorts are getting their a**es killed. NO real other reason! 

Saudi pumping more on eve of Aramco and to help because of Iran!! ROFLMAO!!!!!

6714 2018-05-24 13:00:51 I was surprised by an oil painting of the two on a rooftop as part of a Cleveland Institute of Art's Illustration portfolio, while walking through the lobby to see a film. Made me happy.
6715 2018-05-24 13:00:48 But govt can limit the total tax collected per litre. As of now it is proportional to price of crude oil which causes double beat on middle class

6719 2018-05-24 13:00:25 Ora vado a braccio e spero che la memoria non mi faccia difetto, recentemente il venezuela ha venduto una grossa partita di crude oil all'india facendosi pagare nella nuova cripto di stato (petro) e scontandola del 20%
Ha potuto farlo perchè punta alla rivalutazione del petro >>>
6720 2018-05-24 13:00:24 ...a reminder about the time when State Governors insisted on sharing from the Excess Crude Account...

Demands like this tend to surface when oil prices rise...
6721 2018-05-24 13:00:19 @anjanaomkashyap @sardanarohit @sambitswaraj - Please report petrol prices as percentage of PPP in year 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2017. That would be true reflector of petrol price, not current crude oil price. Processing cost is also a cost.

6746 2018-05-24 12:57:29 The most likely explanation was his advertisements for cannabis oil.  Be pissed off at YT for being such a tight ass platform. If Winters had done it, she would have screen capped her report and shown it on Twitter.  She doesn't do anything anonymously.  Logic 101.
6747 2018-05-24 12:57:22 I hope she is not talking about Oman, Qatar, Bahrain et al.  Something to do with vast reserves of oil. Name another small country?

6750 2018-05-24 12:56:43 Your stupidity is legendary Jim. Our NS revenues over the last 19 years are £85bn. Despite that we still ran up deficits/debts of £150bn. That’s after the oil revenues. (I’ve added this for the terminally stupid).
6751 2018-05-24 12:56:35 We need more info about geregu ie location, off or on grid, solar or turbine. Many Nigerian business man only out to make money but care little about value addition. As an oil man you just exploit and sell with geregu you are bringing in value

6753 2018-05-24 12:56:24 Tax collection from petrol and diesel has gone up 100% since NDA came to power. Some Bhakts claim that higher oil revenues are being used to build infra etc. But capital expenditure growth in d budget is merely 7% per annum ! Koi basic accounting samjaho yaar inko.....

You have NO IDEA what 98% of Americans are struggling with in this "best economy the country's ever had."

6768 2018-05-24 12:55:06 You're confusing the collapse in oil prices with North sea natural decline in production which peaked in 1999. Oil finds won't stop immediately but you will notice that they are smaller oil discoveries and less of them.

6806 2018-05-24 12:51:41 Few days ago Brazilian oil market (PETR3F) had a setup to correction and mídia os doing its paper, everyone is running out of gas. The truck drivers hold a strike action, since then the country is completely caotic.
Its really a dirty game but It is what It is. Now I seeThank you

"CHOP IT OFF."

I'm still laughing.

6819 2018-05-24 12:50:11 i seriously think that stress shrinks the body and it’s usually in the bend of the spine, the pressure in the shoulders where stress accumulates. I recommend a rain drop method massage with an essential oil specialist.

Scalp massages are great; a mixture of castor+jojoba oil & peppermint + tea tree oil to regularly massage your edges & scalp will promote hair growth.

6861 2018-05-24 12:45:10 There are multiple brands but stay away from those that cannot provide a certificate of analysis showing 0 THCa and THC total less than 0.03%.  Also look for cold pressed pure oil without added ingredients.
6862 2018-05-24 12:45:10 Track yes, but unless the practice has changed, supermarkets bulk buy when the oil is low, then it's just an excuse to increase profit to the point that people boycott fuel stations.

6972 2018-05-24 12:33:32 There was NO threat of water theft for Sindh from KBD.

7020 2018-05-24 12:28:38 A pertinent question to ask both Tories and Labour is why  the whole British state doesn’t have an oil fund? The vast profits could have been shared across the Union but wasn’t. Discovered in 1969 we’ve had 20 years of Labour government during that time and not a penny saved.

7025 2018-05-24 12:28:16 Duterte may have nothing to do with oil prices rising globally, but he has everything to do with the peso dropping 18% in two years.
7026 2018-05-24 12:28:12 No need to reduce oil prices rather these should be increased further more because more the prices less would be pollution and expenditure on its import. The money so saved can be spent on facilities being created for a common man .  People are happy, no need to succumb .

7032 2018-05-24 12:27:45 "more sanctions will only punish the starving people and solidify support for Maduro" Oil production income is insignificant, as it is almost entirely destined to pay debts with China and Russia.

And all the sanctions, so far, have not "solidified support" for Maduro.
7033 2018-05-24 12:27:44 All the schemes he mentioned benefit the poor. Per contra, an increase in oil price harms them. In effect he’s telling the poor that if you protest, we will end the schemes that benefit you. That’s worse than blackmail. Its against basic human decency.

Asfandyar is RAW's agent. A snake will always do this. 

Zardari have his commission/income in billions of dollars Oil imports & Private power projects. KBD blocks his income...Dr. Asim was head of PSO!!!

7103 2018-05-24 12:18:41 As excise duty is proportional to the cost of crude oil, so actually govt is collecting more taxes per litre today than it was one month before. And since govt would have not expected this sudden rise in crude oil during budget presentation so this extra tax collection be reduced

7137 2018-05-24 12:14:45 Expect crude oil prices will fall from recent highs. Next month seems likely Saudi Arabia will increase output,
Response likely decrease Iran oil production (expected) and continuing fall in Venezuela cuts in oil production.

7197 2018-05-24 12:08:39 It's at the top of my page. I exposed this corrupt Idaho government as well. Deals made with Big Pharma to keep us from having CBD hemp oil. BUT..Idaho took federal money that stated that Idaho cannot stop ANY hemp products from being sold or used here. Strike one!
7198 2018-05-24 12:08:31 Tax cuts so we can pay higher gas prices? Way to go! Add more to the pockets of big oil.
7199 2018-05-24 12:08:24 Pls report on who benefits & who will be hurt 

by multinational & foreign co exporting US oil & natural gas,

so USA will be dependent on foreign oil again.

Why is USA repeating same mistake that resulted in the 40-year oil embargo that Obama gov lifted in Jan 2016?

7207 2018-05-24 12:06:43 #NYSscandal is just a rehearsal for what will happen when we start exporting oil. Just wait and see. The  cartels are practicing for it. By the way these folks use to loot since independence, it's only that social media is helping us expose them now. #kaburaseason2

7250 2018-05-24 12:01:45 some local was like, "we could be oil free by 2050 if we only invested more" like any of us will be alive by then or if being the world's #1 supplier/producer of oil wasn't the US goal all along.

7258 2018-05-24 12:01:04 Because fossil fuels (even coal!!!) are *much* more efficient than gasoline. Gas loses around 70% of it's energy to heat, while coal is nowhere near that. And to top it all off, even more energy is used to drill and refine the oil that goes into it.

7298 2018-05-24 11:57:06 You don't seem to have an understanding about the oil business.
7299 2018-05-24 11:57:05 During a Visit to Trombay Oil Refinery in 1982 a Senior Engnr had revealed that tonnes of LPG is Burnt off due to lack of Storage facilities as also to keep the Market Price Balance.

7305 2018-05-24 11:56:03 Oil prices are unlikely to be substantially reduced to the levels of 2014/15. Given the trend in supply-demand situation, any reduction in prices in absence of alternative sources of Govt revenue, will seriously jeopardise finances of C/state Govts. Govt must resist provocation.
7306 2018-05-24 11:56:02 Oil marketing companies needed those revenue desperately as they were asked to fund in building statues, and some BJP party celebrations. ONGC was forced to buy corruption ridden GSPC to make some loss that was happened due to #MOdiLoot.

7384 2018-05-24 11:47:42 I totally agree whats the point of exporting resources especially when the government cannot account for most of last year's revenues. The oil should be refined and sold locally.
7385 2018-05-24 11:47:41 Well, whenever you are dealing with an generational planet, you just have to sit still and watch what we are doing as a collective, for example when Saturn to Pluto in early 80’s, crisis for OPEC as oil prices declined, again in 2008-2012.

7470 2018-05-24 11:39:55 Moron @RahulGandhi , price of petroleum fuels are decided not by government but by oil companies and hence Modi has no role to reduce or increase the price. Learn some basic lessons of Public Economics before aspiring to be PM of this country.

7480 2018-05-24 11:38:56 In fact, Turkey is the fastest growing economy in the world although they have no oil and natural resources like Saudi Arabia. A Saudi fanboy is not allowed to talk of other countries, especially when your economy is based on oil.

7487 2018-05-24 11:38:30 Ever since homosexuality was given acceptance, aam aadm is getting buggered. Why? Why should the government benefit from increased crude price? Fix the excise duty at crude oil rate of 50 dollars a barrel/ 45 rupees a litre. Rest increase should only cater for crude price!!!!

7492 2018-05-24 11:38:01 Lol,

Middle East is dependent on India more, illiterate.

We are their big oil consumer and as oil price is high, so even USA ship can supply crude to India on that price like reliance odered oil from USA.

And to add, USA crude oil quality is better then middle East.
7493 2018-05-24 11:37:53 Thanks for the confirmation. That's my concern. If oil continues to rise, our pump prices will reach record highs and inflationary pressures will increase. Would a BOE rate  rise be more likely as a result?
7494 2018-05-24 11:37:22 you *can* extract hefty taxes from listed companies (oil majors in the west pay lots). But what you can't do is list them then keep using them as an off-balance-sheet piggy bank or as an instrument of state policy. GSPC being bailed out by ONGC another good example.

7570 2018-05-24 11:28:24 The increase in demand caused by the increase in economic activity in the US creates a temporary production shortage which increases prices temporarily.

7594 2018-05-24 11:24:48 What is going on in Syria?

Under international law the Syrian gov has a right to its oil fields.  But there was a drive to leverage the foreign fighters to divide up Syria (bypass international law) and to thereby remove Syrian entitlement to its oil fields. This is wrong.

Might be all these people are 'fine' with hikes & think they are only making oil payment. But I do appreciate your way of response to all. These prices are really very painful.

7738 2018-05-24 11:09:14 Post lifting of sanctions, Iran was able to repatriate some of that money back - ie transferred from their Indian account to Iranian / foriegn accounts. Nothing more. We never bought oil which we didn't pay for. We don't owe any unpaid debts.

7750 2018-05-24 11:07:50 Well sir you are ‘right wing’ & living in Malaysia which is an oil producing nation - so you won’t understand that petrol is an essential commodity & it affects prices for virtually everything in an economy.

7755 2018-05-24 11:07:37 The problem lies elsewhere. That is in refining. Private companies can refine but cannot sell directly to oil marketing companies. That is a monopoly. ONGC. So if you want to set a petrol/diesel station you would have to buy crude from them and refine it. Or get end product.

7760 2018-05-24 11:07:01 Farhan bhai since u seems to b keen to know more about d economics of fuel & crude oil

Here are some facts
In Jan 2016 crude was $26/barrel & now it has touched $80/barrel an increase of over 300% whereas fuel price have fluctuated in the range of ₹65-78(Delhi) mere 20%
7761 2018-05-24 11:06:51 This is garbled info. Due to UN sanctions on Iran / its banking system, India cd not transmit money to Iran for oil purchased. 
So the money was paid into an iranian a/c in India. Iran wd occasionally purchase essentials from India with the money (per UN rules).

7855 2018-05-24 10:54:57 WM rubs its hands as oil prices continue to rise @IsThisAB0t @Always_a_Yes @Scotland_future
7856 2018-05-24 10:54:56 Why can’t we use the oil internally for first 10-20years,oil markets aren’t lucrative currently the investment isn’t worth the revenue!

7862 2018-05-24 10:54:35 so why did Congress leave a huge debt with Iran by not paying the crude oil they imported form Iran?  Who will pay that now?  Where will that money come from? Who is playing victim now?
7863 2018-05-24 10:54:33 India has cleared all US$5bn oil dues: Iran

For all the Pappus & Pidis who without understanding of basics of economics, are forwarding petrol hike messages for stupid politics
7864 2018-05-24 10:54:29 Thick coconut milk is the sort of a substance which makes me nauseous (too much oil I guess) but it is also addictive for me personally, so I can't stop stealing a spoonfull after a spoonfull.
7865 2018-05-24 10:54:25 You might have fungal acne. Some folks cannot tolerate oils as oil can inhibit fungus. This is not normal acne, read more about fungal acne. Screw those saying oil cleansing is for all. It's not! I leaned the hard way

8034 2018-05-24 10:31:58 They contribute so little due to the massive tax breaks the UK give them. Every other oil producing countries have been making profits every year even with the low prices. You don’t see oil companies pulling out of those

8135 2018-05-24 10:18:54 Can any economist enlighten me on the consequence of not passing on the crude oil price reduction to consumers? Who would have generated more value in the long run with the price contraction, users or the government? Hope my question is clear?
8136 2018-05-24 10:18:48 Thursday! Asian markets closed mixed, Euorpean trading is mixed, futures are mixed & crude oil is down. After yesterday's activity, who knows?

8188 2018-05-24 10:13:13 Bad news for everyone... oil is higher than it’s been in many years with no signs of slowing down.  Health care cost are higher than ever.  Interest rates are higher so mortgage and car loans are costing more.

8190 2018-05-24 10:12:33 Had bearings checked and oil changed at about 3500hrs. Probably time to have another checkup.

8192 2018-05-24 10:12:26 In previous races (I haven't seen a decent shot yet this weekend), the Ferrari has had oil smoke coming out of the exhaust/wastegate pretty much constantly throughout the lap. Obviously it's not a huge amount but it was always there #SkyF1

8198 2018-05-24 10:11:05 Agreed - but I would still be very wary of over-egging April rebound in car sales & retail sales. Consumer purchasing power is only gradually improving & higher oil prices threaten to weigh down on discretionary spending ability
8199 2018-05-24 10:11:04 If Congress was in power, & tax on petrol/diesel was around same as it was under UPA, Considering how much international crude oil prices have fallen, petrol would cost around Rs. 50 today. #FuelChallenge

8208 2018-05-24 10:10:00 The fact is ONGC has never realised more than$60/bbl for its oil, no matter how high the price went. It normally gets $45/bbl. So this 'levy' will actually help it to realize at least $70.. ;)

8223 2018-05-24 10:08:12 Iran supports legitimate,states within it's region, while the the US and the Saudi's continue with their regime change and destabilization in the region,the mission is to regulate oil prices.
8224 2018-05-24 10:08:01 We are discussing (or I thought we were) why there is not as much sugar as the US in China but there is a rise in obesity. I am saying adding in more meat and seed oil to their existing diet is just making them fatter. They aren't eating meals like that infographic.

Glad to see you given #FuelChallenge to Honorable PM @narendramodi sir. Here's is one from me..

Give back all money deposited in Swiss Bank through corruption like 2G, Augusta, jeep,Jija G scams. 

PM will use The money to reduce oil prices.
Waiting for reply..
8249 2018-05-24 10:03:21 Short term it certainly does. This is a good point. My only counter is that while electronics and oil are relatively inelastic, other imports (looking at gold) should face pressure. Also long term lower rates will push remittances into India higher.

8263 2018-05-24 10:00:45 The meat doesn't have to be the culprit per se, but excess sugar plus seed oil makes the meat just fodder for fat storage. Seed oil and sugar are only truly ignificant in the presence of excess. I could eat 1000 cals of seed oil every day and would lose fat.

8304 2018-05-24 09:54:31 Sir as per my calculations it's Rs, 41.00/liter. And there is still a way to reduce the taxes to cut down flue price. Today's oil per barrel is USD70*69 ( Inr against USD) divided by 119 (liters per barrel). May be I'm wrong too. Interesting question  to learn from.

8396 2018-05-24 09:40:17 Not as far as I saw - membership of the EEA got them into informal council discussions, and they got consulted/informed at the start of the process. We're not NO/ICE or LIE is my point - two are tiny, and Norway has disproportionally large oil/gas reserves per capita.

8406 2018-05-24 09:39:25 Retweeted Jackson Ude (@jacksonpbn):

How can Buhari claim that oil price stood still at $100 per barrel fo 16yrs PDP was in power. In 1999 when Obasanjo took over, oil price was around  $18-$20 per barrel.
Buhari indeed is an olodo, a classical itiboribo of no equal!
8407 2018-05-24 09:39:17 And as they say, the squeaky wheel gets the oil.

The anointed have to do better with laying hands on the sick and anointing the sick with oil. I think that’s been lost.

8429 2018-05-24 09:36:05 ...if Big Oil/Automotive owns the media (via advertising spend), then that means each time news orgs publish climate change stories, or run investigations that spur federal recalls and lawsuits against GM/Ford/etc, they are brazenly trolling the fuck out of Big Oil/Automotive.

8457 2018-05-24 09:32:09 Hi Paul, I understand that it can be frustrating to find that prices have increased. Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. - Ian
8458 2018-05-24 09:31:56 Put oil under much hyped GST and see the resultant GDP. You will start cursing our govt.People happiness is inversely proportional to GDP.
8459 2018-05-24 09:31:50 Right you are. Chiming with you earlier, I've read paper from Tegemeo about *exhausted soils* demanding ever more inputs, so would be wary of an emphasis on fertiliser say. Also anticipating higher oil/chemical fertiliser prices.

Storage should smooth out overproduction, no?
8460 2018-05-24 09:31:39 Absolutely no reason to put $300bln in for a new Scottish pound, especially if Scottish pound backed by North Sea Oil reserves.
8461 2018-05-24 09:31:26 Hike in oil price is depends upon the price of crude oil in international market and the exchange value of rupees against dollars. Neither You nor any one can do anything.

8509 2018-05-24 09:24:59 Don't know if this govt is clean or corrupt but I have a feeling, its trying to balance the present and future, obviously at some cost. Advice yu to get to cycling mode. It vl reduce some demand for oil at national level. That vl contribute to get prices down some way

8523 2018-05-24 09:23:24 Price Variation on Crude for the period 2014 to 2018 was in the decreasing return with corresponding macro revenue earned by the Nation through Oil Producing Companies without passing any benefit to the consumers. It is not understood whereas these macro revenue credited?
8524 2018-05-24 09:23:16 How upside down is Modi ji’s economy?  You can gauge that from the fact that while fuel prices for consumers are at the highest level EVER, ONGC, the only major oil producer has just tanked 8% to 163.  Only Modi Sarkar can bring you the worst of both worlds.

8530 2018-05-24 09:22:04 If there's going to be another indy discussion lets get this out the way:

Having an oil industry is a hedge against world oil prices.

It's a good thing regardless of whether oil prices are high or low and even if you decide to leave most of it in the ground.
8531 2018-05-24 09:21:53 No matter how much the petrol prices are slashed, the oil burden will remain same. At a reduced cost, the consumption will increase exponentially, as if the consumers will start to drink petrol...

8534 2018-05-24 09:21:05 Tax collection from petrol and diesel has gone up 100% since NDA came to power.Govt claims higher oil revenues being used to build infra assets. But capital expenditure growth in budget merely 7% per annum. Where are oil taxes going? God alone knows!
8535 2018-05-24 09:21:04 What a load of pish , Wm mismanagement cost the Uk ( not just Scotland )  billions, and oil has always been seen as a bonus to Scotlands economy not an essential .

8540 2018-05-24 09:20:30 The corrupt govt cud do it with the cost f fiscal deficit. The so called clean govt has reduced that gap. Its good fr economy. The govt is involved in building new repositories to store oil purchased when prices r low n use when prices go up. It wud draw some cost too.
8541 2018-05-24 09:20:21 Is that good for cracked heels? I’m talking about the coconut oil. Cheers works on everything obv.

We know we need fatty acids. We know the transfats  naturally found in beef are not the same as industrial ones. so what's new?
8593 2018-05-24 09:12:45 No, .@RuthDavidsonMSP - Scotland isn’t more prosperous within the UK. We’ve had 50 years of oil, and all that happened is that the wealth flowed south. What has Scotland got to show for it? What, specifically, makes you say we’re wealthier? #IndyRef2

8711 2018-05-24 08:54:58 Oil prices are up internationally. So there is nothing much the government can do unless people pay their taxes correctly. In India the elite people are the biggest fraudsters in paying taxes. So to run the country indirect taxation is inevitable.

Other major trades we export to the US are gold, potash (used to make fertilizer), natural gas & wood (Canada is the US’s main supplier of wood). There’s others, but those are the big ones.

8953 2018-05-24 08:16:04 It amazes me that the oil companies can’t seem to see this coming. Just over the last few days my local filling station appears to have been raising fuel prices by almost a penny a day. I mean, are they insane? The higher the price goes faster the take up of EVs will be.

9205 2018-05-24 07:35:40 .. Always make sure to change the oil in your car & never leave your drink unattended!
9206 2018-05-24 07:35:36 I loveee roll-on perfume fragrance oil. I’d take that over spray any day.
9207 2018-05-24 07:35:32 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
9208 2018-05-24 07:35:28 Weimar had its supply side destroyed then borrowed in foreign currencies to buy gold. Venezuela has Dutch disease, due to oil supplies it never diversified and relied solely on imports. Price of oil collapsed and so did its exchange rate and import prices went up.
9209 2018-05-24 07:35:27 "Windfall Oil Tax on ONGC in offing to soften fuel prices" (sources to PTI, via CNBC)

Seriously? A one-time tax on ONGC because oil prices have gone up? Wow.

9211 2018-05-24 07:35:01 Don’t be too harsh on @theSNP , they’re not the brightest. Given the @OBR_UK stated oil was worth £900m to the economy in 2017/18, it would only take 333 years to salt away enough hard currency to underwrite the new one!

9244 2018-05-24 07:29:54 It also seems to me that this has become a political issue. We simply cannot afford to risk handing a catastrophic and irreversible legacy to our descendants based on the transient political whims of those with vested interests in the oil and motor industries and who hold >

You need to burn/really heat the garlic clove in oil and then let it cool down a bit. Then put few drops of that oil in your ear. 
It does work!

9260 2018-05-24 07:27:07 The law says oil revenue should only be used for development and capital expenditures but also gives a percentage to cultural leaders. This creates inconsistency in the law.

Why you people didn't paid the dues of oil?
Why you stale construction of #RamMandir
Why no basic facilities to citizens till date?
Your leader is in bail na.... 
9277 2018-05-24 07:23:16 Also no transparency on Job and other benefits from CPEC for people of FATa and KP.
9278 2018-05-24 07:22:51 I still feel that a profligate GEJ would not have been able to cope with low oil prices and foreign reserves. Maybe we would have been like Venezuela now. Buhari could do much better in many sectors though.
9279 2018-05-24 07:22:50 More likely because of Brexit the UK is skint and every pound of oil revenue is desperately needed, so Westminster has taken the shackles off.

9282 2018-05-24 07:22:02 Yep, paid USD 100,-/day per terrorist. Must have cost the Saudis billions and billions causing the soon collaps of the terrorist state.
Tensions with Iran ratched up to drive the price of oil up.
Saudis need over USD 100,-/barrel to survive bankruptcy.
9283 2018-05-24 07:21:37 @narendramodi Dear PM Sir,
The rag tag opposition will not dent your chances but oil prices will certainly defeat you during the next elections. Take action now and provide relief to people from the very high imposition of taxes on fuel.
9284 2018-05-24 07:21:24 I think that a gas major like Centrica will be interested in the gas and someone like Statoil or TOTAL for the oil
9285 2018-05-24 07:21:07 With oil 
9286 2018-05-24 07:20:43 @ArvindKejriwal 
Sir now base price of crude oil increasing so tax of centre gov is also increasing. Delhi gov added VAT on these totals. Am I right ?
By this means your VAT charges increasing,
So why not u fix ur VAT and gives some relief to Delhi public.
Duyae milegi sir plz do
9287 2018-05-24 07:20:11 If you sell oil to Asia to drive up the price the US pays, then BC will pay more for refined petro products from the US seeing as how we only have 1 refinery. If you think AB will send more refined product down the pipe to BC over shipping more out by oil tanker...guess again!
9288 2018-05-24 07:19:59 También. Correcto. Sin más datos no se puede concluir que no esté pagado por Big Oil. Yo lo que listaba en mi tuit eran los hechos.

9300 2018-05-24 07:18:03 What I’m saying is it’s hypocritical to claim you protect the water by being against oil while owning/operating gas powered boat. 

Seriously, that’s complete BS! Not sure why that’s so hard to figure out. 

Do you deny yourself/others medication but be against pharma?
9301 2018-05-24 07:17:45 The divide has started. An alternative to SWIFT is on the way, petrodollar is on the decline, etc. EU using EURO to buy oil from Iran is another nail in the coffin..

9305 2018-05-24 07:16:17 Why Oil Refineries have not reduced the Petrol Diesel ? Even private refineries are making huge money, all the Petrol pumps dealers of private refineries are reopened now after long closure.
9306 2018-05-24 07:15:47 yes, all a bit murky on that side. one very valid concern a friend of mine from FATA highlighted was that in the post-merger dispensation, there are no guarantees of budgetary allocations actually being spent on these new districts.
9307 2018-05-24 07:15:35 So there was oil on my shoe & martin took it off and put it on the dab table.

9315 2018-05-24 07:14:25 Don't tell me that you believe that India is an oil producing country. Govt is also battling with the UPA debt of 1000 cr to Iran. It's an utopian dream to sell petrol in rs 30 unless it is brought in the ambit of GST and govt along can't take decision on GST.

9320 2018-05-24 07:13:47 Hey @amitmalviya you forgot to mention international crude oil prices of 2013-2014(till May) and from June 2014 till now you think we are fools and BLIND BHAKT like yourself
9321 2018-05-24 07:13:47 Brent crude oil prices gained modestly during the May 22 trading session in London to remain above $79/bbl for a second consecutive day while light, sweet crude oil prices dropped slightly May 22 on the New York market to settle above $72/bbl. #BrentCrudeOil #OilandGas #Energy
9322 2018-05-24 07:13:36 Thanks to President Trump, the Russian economy has just had a massive increase in income due to the substantial increase in the price of Crude Oil. Even the so called Russian Oligarchs could not have helped Mr Putin as much as POTUS has. In Moscow they say God bless Trump.
9323 2018-05-24 07:13:35 @benkoku @MBawumia  If oil emerged as 2nd best foreign exchange earner, then it should not fund free SHS cos oil reserves have life span. Instead free SHS should be funded  with levies similar to getfund for sustainability & continuity so that oil revenue funds infrastructure

9442 2018-05-24 07:00:11 There's no crude oil price hike, apparently its cheaper than the price in the last 5 years. Do your math. Public money being used for unscrupulous political practices and covering up  economic setback due to #demonetisation
9443 2018-05-24 07:00:10 What we got from the Saudis is a ton of terrorists on 9/11 who never suffered any repercussions; and OIL, of course!!

9485 2018-05-24 06:52:48 Well studies in Africa showed people get taller , healthier and brainier with increased meat consumption.   Haven't seen any showing the same effect from adding in seed oil sugar and  carbs.

9743 2018-05-24 06:11:05 Gas prices are not subject to demand from the consumer. There is an oversupply of gas.  OPEC sets oil prices, other factors like refining costs come into play.  But it is not dictated by consumers. This is a REALLY basic economic point.

9766 2018-05-24 06:08:02 Theoretically it was supppse to keep the prices in line with international price cz whenever prices used to increase oil companies used to bear the loss, but the only thing it has done is preventing huge lines at petrol pumps day before the hike in fuel price

Now, global crude oil prices hv recently risen to $80/ barrel but petrol has already breached the Rs 76 mark”

9865 2018-05-24 05:52:07 Pretty much. I've been giving them the flip side of the argument: the oil sands are too big to stay out of the spotlight, so we need an answer on climate change. Carbon pricing is a good answer. "We're too small to matter" is not.
9866 2018-05-24 05:52:03 Amazes me how much Criticism Tesla gets but recals on other car companies happen ALL the time and usually get a pass... Big Oil sure knows how to buy the media...

9958 2018-05-24 05:37:47 #FuelPriceHike : crude oil price has come down to 80$/bbl from 115$/bbl earlier,dealer price of fuel has also fallen from 53Rs/Lt to 37Rs/Lt . The price increase is due to central exise rising from 9Rs/ltr to ~19.5Rs/ltr. That said 42% of this excise goes to state coffers 1/n

That slayking JK cooking ugali with oil. Mashakura I can't. Homabay special all the way
9960 2018-05-24 05:37:34 Madam we should be discussing inflation and oil prices... Rather than his letter.. Now about his letter-- my country's constitution doesn't/will not allow religious interference from church/masjids/temples #justsaying
9961 2018-05-24 05:37:32 Same I have a lot of products. But I always pay attention to the ingredients before buying them.  But yes everyone’s hair is different because my hair hates coconut oil. It’s really great if your trying to transition your hair from straight back to curly though.

9966 2018-05-24 05:37:15 Reverting to my "damn dirty hippie" ways. Patchouli oil yesterday and now burning nag champa incense tonight. And honestly, I'm not mad about it.
9967 2018-05-24 05:37:13 Did I see @KoinangeJeff add salt and milk to ugali?? Olive oil yes but salt and milk?? Acha nibaki hapo kwa #jalango. Natural anytime #PowerBreakfast
9968 2018-05-24 05:37:01 Building new refineries is counter active in Canada. It costs billions to do so that may never make its money back. We need pipelines to get our oil to market, anything else is bunk
9969 2018-05-24 05:36:50 And oil can’t survive without FAR bigger subsidies. 3.3 Billion from Canadian govt annually. And Now #KinderMorgan is getting another 1.2 Billion as a gift!  Give just one year of that to renewables and we would be set!
9970 2018-05-24 05:36:46 Jesus is coming soon Those who are awake Sound the Alarm  Fill our oil Preach the Gospel 
9971 2018-05-24 05:36:37 Opened my window because of oil paint fumes and now I'm cold
9972 2018-05-24 05:36:31 おめでと！
9973 2018-05-24 05:36:19 Yes, although oil price will change that equation., even if hedging means kicking the can down the road.
9974 2018-05-24 05:36:12 Got potato chips cravings. Went to the store. Picked up Kettle in Avocado oil. 100% pure, the bag says.
That shit is so salty, it’s awful. Still ate the whole bag...
9975 2018-05-24 05:36:01 Green, green smoke, to reflect the envious streak that runs through him as thick as an oil strike.......
9976 2018-05-24 05:35:59 That’s true. I have sooooo many curly hair products but my hair loves coconut oil specially. Everyone’s hair is different though
9977 2018-05-24 05:35:52 The only legal provision cited-Article 42 of Vienna Convention only prohibits a diplomatic agent from doing business in the RECEIVING STATE. It appears no hard law has been breached. On a larger positive side was the discovery of oil in commercial quantity.
9978 2018-05-24 05:35:51 กูนี้โตจนเลี้ยงตัวเองได้ แต่กลับเอาตัวไม่รอดเรื่องความรัก อีเหี้ยไปคิดถึงเขาทำไม
9979 2018-05-24 05:35:47 @JerotichSeii we now have oil let's stay woke and see the hullabaloos that will be happening! Itakuwa sakata kubwa kuliko hata ya #NYS
9980 2018-05-24 05:35:42 @dpradhanbjp @narendramodi 
Sir a very humble suggestion to keep fuel price in check for consumers: crude oil price should be capped at usd 50 per bbl for excise and state/GST levies purpose. This will not affect state and central finances and also keep consumer from very steep
9981 2018-05-24 05:35:38 Ya oil color donc je présume.
9982 2018-05-24 05:35:33 He’s talking about my boat in the profile pic. Apparently we have to live in caves and use no plastic, gas, oil, wood, etc to be allowed to comment without being hypocrites.
9983 2018-05-24 05:35:31 By that one scene, you were forever immortalized on ALL porn sites. LOL
You in baby oil w/ black pumps and that dude (I forgot his name,  I wanna say Wesley Pipes but all those bald niggas look alike) 
Classic.
@MsMyaG
9984 2018-05-24 05:35:30 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
9985 2018-05-24 05:35:27 Seemed like a busy day.

-A hero threw water at Tomi Lahren, which is being treated as an act of violence
-The president had another tantrum
-A billionaire baby had several minor meltdowns and has proposed that the media and oil industry and colluding to make him look bad
9986 2018-05-24 05:35:25 I love my oil diffusers so much. My house smells amazing.
9987 2018-05-24 05:35:11 That is completely true, instead of criticize the innovation and the purpose of Tela's cars, it would be hight supported by all the world, including the media. Tesla have problems just as others oil cars companies, is really unfair to read news just about negative affairs.
9988 2018-05-24 05:34:53 Oil , almond oil , mix it in a bottle altogether , be consistent with piling your hair , massage your scalp and deep conditioning. Once you bleach your hair it’ll loosen up the curls sometimes , if it does finger coil to train your curls and always moisturize your hair !
9989 2018-05-24 05:34:45 Go olive oil bat ang mahal mo
9990 2018-05-24 05:34:36 boyle oil
9991 2018-05-24 05:34:11 So you ain’t tell me to go buy Johnson’s baby lotion and oil & get the towels and all that ?
9992 2018-05-24 05:34:09 California and their dopey Climate change bill is controlling the prices on the market.  Oil companies don’t hesitate to raise prices to make Californians suffer for the idiocy in Sacramento.
9993 2018-05-24 05:33:54 Because Trump's claims allowed some voters to see their specific lives recovering/improving, specific being the operative word. If you were a coal miner, or assembled air conditioners, or drilled for or transported oil, or assembled cars, or even freaken made cakes (I digress)...
9994 2018-05-24 05:33:44 Shameless plug for ours @NimVedaAust :) We use #Ayurveda in ours because we believe #NaturalHair deserves #NaturalProducts only & best of all, we're #AffordableOrganic. Have you tried natural jojoba oil? Our curly haired clients swear by it!
9995 2018-05-24 05:33:31 Oil diffusers change everything!!! The air and the mood and my life
9996 2018-05-24 05:33:23 Reminder: dilbit is not refined here, and is the issue at hand, not oil. Can't be cleaned-up. Period. Quit with the externalized costs, & you have no profit & you know it. If BC needs oil or refined gasoline, who's selling? Forcing BC buy from WA doesn't sound 'Canadian' buddy.
9997 2018-05-24 05:33:21 eh?? aku tonton lg coba yaaa setauku dia suka kek poasta kasih olive oil aja sama garlic
9998 2018-05-24 05:33:06 あっぶね
9999 2018-05-24 05:33:05 u see how indians now use fake diya or paraffin wax?  do u know how idiot we have become.. such a show off hollow intellect.. this wax burns without any black color smoke but with deadly gases.. while oil or ghee burn with dark harmless carbon smoke..
10000 2018-05-24 05:33:05 Neta's voice- cost of petrol/L shd be 25/-
Crude oil/L @ 30/-
Has to be refined
Refineries to pay salaries to thousands of employees
Cost of transportation
Other hidden costs
Taxes levied by States
Oil not in domain of GST
Think twice to demand
Petrol at 25..

10007 2018-05-24 05:31:51 あそこ大好きwwwwwwww
10008 2018-05-24 05:31:42 Oil price increase may be out of our control, but excise tax can definitely be controlled. Hindi sinisisi ang government sa pagtaas ng oil products, yung fuel excise tax bec of TRAIN Law ang nirereklamo na nakadagdag ng burden.
10009 2018-05-24 05:31:40 ขอบคุณน้าา จุ้บๆๆๆ
