38 2018-05-09 23:35:31 The FairX platform intends to use the stellar exchange platform big time.  It may be that this is where the ICO's are launched initially.  Kind of like penny stocks.  Then they move up the line to other brokerages partnered in the system.
39 2018-05-09 23:34:47 His premise is flawed - stocks have been going up for a number of reasons-he just picked oil prices to make a point, but more than the rich do well when stocks rise - many people have 401k investments. Gas prices rise and fall - they even out as supply and demand adjust.
40 2018-05-09 23:34:19 I had an extremely busy day today and didn't get to check on my stocks only but a couple times. $UHLN took a dip and I can't wait to load my boat even more!! Cant pass these cheapies up!
41 2018-05-09 23:34:01 Cycles are very fatalistic. When it's time for  5+ year long bear market in stocks, it won't matter if there's QE or not. Stocks will go nowhere even with QE.
42 2018-05-09 23:33:08 'I'll f***ing kill you': What it's really like answering triple-0 calls. Would like to see this scum named, put on a TV show in stocks, try to explain their actions. voted on. fail get face full of rotten fruit/eggs. really need a vote on this.

44 2018-05-09 23:31:22 @thump have rules, especially with penny stocks. Use very tight stops, sometimes limit when it come back to you.
45 2018-05-09 23:30:15 What a whopper of a lie. Bump stocks do NOT turn a semi-automatic into an automatic. Cincinnati has now violated Ohio law with this ban. Cincinnati city council breaks the law and then expects people to follow laws it passes. Hypocrites and liars!

51 2018-05-09 23:22:43 Done. Bump stocks mean more horrific deaths and injuries, and more shattered families and communities. Life is a right; domestic tranquility is a govt obligation.

53 2018-05-09 23:20:11 After 2 years of pain, Canadian energy stocks are surging. When oil ticked up last month, so did our yield curve.
54 2018-05-09 23:18:51 When you find out, lemme know, I'mma have to grab some while stocks last.
55 2018-05-09 23:18:31 So you watch stocks for 8 years. Should have invested in those 8 years. News flash it almost tripled! Trump inherited a bull market but you know those pesky things called facts elude you
56 2018-05-09 23:18:09 One of Rani's calves was a stillbirth & 2 died of EEHV (elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus, which has proliferated in zoos & is a horrific death by internal hemorrhaging). If Rani and/or Spike are EEHV-exposed neither should be bred again but zoos gotta replenish their stocks.

61 2018-05-09 23:15:31 Why..bump stocks don't look people
62 2018-05-09 23:15:31 Alberto Fernandez: el JGM del gobierno q tuvo las mejores condiciones internas y externas, desde 1810 a la fecha. Nos legaron 30% de pobres, se consumieron los stocks de recursos y se afanaron todo, no haciendo puentes donde se necesitaban tuneles.
63 2018-05-09 23:15:12 As mentioned earlier, an old guy shot 1000+ people in 10 minutes & the govt can't even manage to ban bump stocks. 17 kids die in one school & still nothing is done, simply because there is no will to do anything. Uniquely in the West, huge body counts are acceptable.
64 2018-05-09 23:14:46 Fantasies are like religion, great to have personally, horrible to base public policy on. The truth is that the teen market for vapes is tiny, JUUL have always marketed to their largest market, adult smokers. They are succeeding so much tobacco stocks are tumbling.

73 2018-05-09 23:09:23 Hey @WCPO council member Smitherman voted for the bump stock ban.  The story you just aired at 7 included a sound bite of him speaking against a separate resolution on an issue related to concealed carry not bump stocks.
74 2018-05-09 23:07:00 Democrats have implemented a progressive agenda this legislative session that protects healthcare benefits for CT residents, bans bump stocks, and ensures that every student in Connecticut has the resources to succeed.
75 2018-05-09 23:06:27 we needed your help to ban bump stocks.

266 2018-05-09 20:54:01 Hi John, Why distillated stocks fall down aggressively?
267 2018-05-09 20:53:33 The work to ban bump stocks has already happened. It was determined and supported by the President that they be banned.
268 2018-05-09 20:51:45 Aye, maybe even get the one major Middle East player that's refused to ratify it's OPCW requirements for it's Chemical Weapons stocks. You know, the one that was found guilty of and finally admitted to murdering innocent civilians in another country.
269 2018-05-09 20:51:35 Economics-Pension and IRAs own stocks-Buybacks are an investment choice when companies consider alternatives-Buybacks reduce market shares outstanding which drives stock prices higher, benefitting pension fund and retirement funds and ESOPs. The claim is false
270 2018-05-09 20:51:22 A lot of good old boys in Virginia with bump stocks typing almost exactly the same comments??? May be they went to the same school.

273 2018-05-09 20:50:08 Dress it up however you like but Wenger and Conte have turned Arsenal and Chelsea into laughing stocks. Will take years for both to recover if they ever do. Wenger genuinely just went senile but Conte was a cynical sabotage which the Chelsea hierarchy shouldn’t have allowed.

296 2018-05-09 20:39:09 The top five stocks that gained today were $TRIP, $EA, $OXY. $LYB, and $MU.
297 2018-05-09 20:38:46 1. Trump backs out of Iran nuclear deal and threatens sanctions. 

2. Price of crude oil jumps way up. 

3. Companies like Exxon are raking in cash due to their stocks jumping. 

4. Us peasents pay more for a necessity.

303 2018-05-09 20:35:10 Fair enough One aspect of it that is super interesting is the ability to socialize trading with your friends/family/co-workers.

305 2018-05-09 20:34:44 We ban these bump stocks banned.  This is one of many common sense solutions to someone being able to shoot over 600 people in 12 minutes.
306 2018-05-09 20:34:35 Just hold it at your side and let the recoil from firing bring the gun back to your trigger finger. It takes a little bit to get it right but it’s the same thing although bump stocks make it easier, it’s called bump firing that’s why they’re called bump stocks.
307 2018-05-09 20:34:10 My dentist told me just yesterday that he's selling all of his stocks because #Trump pulled out of the #IranDeal--expecting war !

309 2018-05-09 20:33:17 He has reinvented himself numerous times.  The media does a very bad job of portraying him accurately in part because of how clever he is at PR.  He went from cigar butt stocks (no longer exists), hedge fund, insurance man, realized power of low beta investing, etc.

314 2018-05-09 20:31:42 TBF, bump stocks are useful to law-abiding gun owners as little more than something to make range time more fun (and potentially, more expensive).

That being said, they shouldn’t be illegal.
315 2018-05-09 20:31:02 Wall Street Instant Update; #Stocks close Wednesday trading with a triple digit Dow gain of 182 at 24,542, Nasdaq Comp. up 73, S&P up 25
316 2018-05-09 20:30:51 And btway it was paul ryan who talked about looking into banning bump stocks when the horrible news of mass shooting got out, of course under pressure of a tragedy u cant say no, but later u changed ur mind to say it should not be banned! How dare someone can be!
317 2018-05-09 20:30:27 Like buying stocks in 2010?  And 11’? And 12’?  And...
318 2018-05-09 20:30:19 Obama did not approve the bump stocks, the ATF did, behind his back, and with the arm twisting from the NRA.

324 2018-05-09 20:28:23 If one really wanted pharma law advice why wouldn't a huge company like N seek out a real company that specializes in it? 

It's too much money & we know they've timed things w/stocks & I at least know there's been some unusual approval patterns.
325 2018-05-09 20:28:02 I'm sure you're right. But you know how you just don't get on with some stocks - MTN one of those for me.
326 2018-05-09 20:27:57 Ok stupid, try to understand it's not guns, bump stocks or any device that causes harm, it's the person behind the device, be it a gun, knife, bomb, or white van running over people.they will always find a way to hurt others. Identify them, identify the cause, stop the violence.

332 2018-05-09 20:26:36 Ct gun violence is most prevalent on the streets of our major cities during robberies or gang conflicts  using firearms illegally obtained. Banning bump stocks does nothing to curtail those activities and would only be used on an already banned platform
333 2018-05-09 20:25:01 Yes,I get you but kmdo keep in mind that Donald Trump lied of being a billionaire whilst he was a millionaire to gain access to win big score in stocks and investment to be a billionaire ! Man lied his way up to be rich and now I must belive that is true?

336 2018-05-09 20:23:25 in a sane world the stocks should go down because every other industry - airlines in particular - got screwed by trump's moves.
can't wait for gas to go back up to 4-6 bucks during the summer, hurting the tourism business and truck shipping.
337 2018-05-09 20:23:22 Please clarify how the President is a "con man"? Has he made the US a better or worse place? Has he lied about what he would accomplish or is he accomplishing his promises? Are jobs up or down? Unemployment up or down? Stocks up or down? Etc.. "Con man" or "MAGA"? I say #MAGA !
338 2018-05-09 20:22:57 And of course the best thing - the military bloodshed stocks, which took a dive of up to 10% directly after the Korean summit, are on the rise again. Raytheon, L3 Technologies, Northrop Grumman and others are recovering. Hooray.

No. Dow went up because energy stocks went up. Energy stocks went up cause oil prices went up a lot. Rich did well. People who need to fill their car with gas will soon suffer. Facts matter.

345 2018-05-09 20:19:31 World stocks generally higher: US +1%; Europe +.6%. Investors overcame their inflation fears,10-year T-Note cracking 3% & Iran uncertainty to push stocks higher. Took solid rise in oil prices as a + even though could stoke inflation. 2018 still a good bet for a positive year.
346 2018-05-09 20:17:35 Now that Iran's oil production is no longer in play, we have some gains in cost of oil. Just basic supply and demand at work. So if you have oil stocks this is good...but you will see a little surprise at the gas pump.

385 2018-05-09 19:54:20 Whoops, that is a quite an investing mistake. Inflation is quite irrelevant to the affluent, they own assets that almost automatically adjust to inflation (real estate, stocks). The people that really get hurt by (increasing) inflation are pensioners and people on fixed wages.

395 2018-05-09 19:47:07 If you are following 1 srock oe 2 & ur not looking at more of a macro picture making money will be very difficult.

398 2018-05-09 19:46:07 decent especially in last hour or so. probably oversold in many stocks, but, at end of day, one must figure out if company going forward is fundamentally and financially sound. you can invest by it or speculate too as to positive catalysts in LT.

424 2018-05-09 19:37:51 That's pretty funny, but it is a slight exaggeration. Not everyone who listens to Warren Buffett invests the exact same way he does. I've never owned KO, AXP, BAC, WFC, or KHC, but I try to listen to WB whenever I can. It's the principles he espouses, not necessarily the stocks.

438 2018-05-09 19:28:43 isn't it intentional? I mean, the Chinese deliberately chose to release their corn stocks in 2016 or 2017? I think CHina keeps "strategic stocks" only of oil and rare earths now.

453 2018-05-09 19:21:27 Why not trade the higher priced stocks because you get multiple points and you dont need size 2 to 3k shares can get you several points and the momentum shifts off support and resistance are easier to predict and less crowded less stress like htz today you could have killed it

524 2018-05-09 18:41:44 Fuck I just remembered stocks is for boys and class is for men
525 2018-05-09 18:41:20 All these videos of stocks being butchered in cruel ways had my self half-consciously having less and less various kinds of meaty food lately.
526 2018-05-09 18:40:42 U.S stocks advanced on Wednesday as a surge in oil prices boosted  energy stocks following President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw  the United States from a nuclear deal with Iran.
527 2018-05-09 18:40:30 Here's a pitch:
A clairvoyant tries to keep a low profile running their tarot card shop. They fight the urge to win the lottery or buy winning stocks because every path but the one they are on ends in total disaster.
528 2018-05-09 18:39:41 What are you like the only unemployed person in the country my business is kicking ass my stocks have gone up 50% life is grand... I'm sorry you're so miserable I bet things were a lot better when you got Obamacare an a free phone
529 2018-05-09 18:39:19 You want a fun challenge? Try eating large stocks of broccoli gracefully in front of your boss
530 2018-05-09 18:38:56 Bump stocks don't kill people and therefore have no implications on people's right to life. Your statement is intellectually weak.
531 2018-05-09 18:38:17 Or bond like stocks. E.g. SUPR shares pay 5.5% plus RPI and are backed by 18 year property leases.
532 2018-05-09 18:37:56 WB on Bitcoin vs. stocks:
Buying a business, we not only have what we bought but something the asset produced. When you buy non-productive assets you're only counting on the next guy paying you more. But the asset itself creates nothing.

554 2018-05-09 18:29:06 Depends. For margin stuff like this, I don’t like it as much, especially for crappy stocks. But for the index as it’s in this sort of position I don’t mind as much.

556 2018-05-09 18:28:13 Out of curiosity, do you leave your trades open overnight?

Probably my biggest struggle when trading traditional stocks, don't like waking up to rekt and not being able to do much about it.
557 2018-05-09 18:27:18 I thought you were talking about individual stocks.

568 2018-05-09 18:21:56 This can't be happening in this country! GOP is responsible for giving this money to the rich that reinvested their $ in stocks. All of u should be punished! Inhumane!
569 2018-05-09 18:21:23 investors so commonly chase their way into new positions - so many will find stocks RSI(5) overbought when they final pull the trigger...
570 2018-05-09 18:20:30 Why cant these stocks just do what i want them to do?! Ok apple, you go up today and tesla, you play your magic trick when you fall 15 points only to recover 10 tomorrow

578 2018-05-09 18:17:46 That looks quite optimistic given sizeable investor overweights in hard currency and corporate EM debt as well as sizeable 12m rolling inflows into EM stocks. FDI in key countries likely to decline yoy too...

582 2018-05-09 18:15:50 What other stocks and coins do you like where the outcome is obvious?
583 2018-05-09 18:15:24 If you say we are not in a bubble and that stocks are the best place to be then why do you have over $100B in cash? You said this same thing right before the financial crisis. Please be honest and not a ‘Corpy’.
584 2018-05-09 18:15:02 If you keep speculating like that, someone in the know can short their stocks. Someone is going to make a lot of money!

586 2018-05-09 18:13:59 Is there a physical record store that stocks everything you want? I mean I like Rough Trade and all but it still doesn’t have everything. So mix it up. Spotify. Action. Juno. Whatever.
587 2018-05-09 18:13:44 For people just starting out @Stash is excellent, it allows average people to buy fractions of the biggest and popular stocks in the world i.e. Amazon & Google, so if you have little to start out try there

592 2018-05-09 18:12:54 He’s a disingenuous cheerleader for the big whigs that benefit from higher stocks
593 2018-05-09 18:11:38 Agree, he admitted this. I was referring to text-only. He also said that most people using crypto make it w/o informed decision. And he would not do it. Crypto is not bad but trading it not knowing smth about it is bad. Though it is just as true for traditional stocks
594 2018-05-09 18:11:37 Question. If Warren Buffett believes what he is telling people today, that "stocks are not in a bubble and the best place to be is in stocks," why does he have a 100+ billion cash hoard? Interesting wouldn't you say?
595 2018-05-09 18:11:09 Best bet? Stocks themselves. Glad I bought a ton of activision and take two in the spring of 2016. No brainer. #esports #activision #taketwo #esl #stocks #StockMarket
596 2018-05-09 18:10:13 Easier said than done of course. The trade was move everything out of weed and blockchain stocks in Jan and into beaten down energy names

601 2018-05-09 18:07:52 yes I am not playing low float stocks
602 2018-05-09 18:07:48 Minor mistakes today, first one was a fomo trade $50 loss, cut it before it took me for more, second one I missed one key part of my strategy, cost me $60.

610 2018-05-09 18:04:49 Ah. I see, but I understand (without RTFA, mind) this situation to be a bit different, or it COULD be. should be acting solely on the fact that her boss was having her purchase those stocks, NOT on the info which lead him to do so...
611 2018-05-09 18:04:28 Sorry! The offer lasts until the stocks lasts with the seller, you'll have to check out as soon as the product is added to cart. Request your understanding.
612 2018-05-09 18:04:03 however perhaps for this woman her boss didn't have any proprietary knowledge, so might be fine. I mean people buy stocks based on what Jim Cramer says
613 2018-05-09 18:03:52 What can I say...I'm addicted to Penny Stocks and exposing Liberal Hypocrisy... LOL
614 2018-05-09 18:03:38 Only an Italian from New York can make a stocks and bonds class interesting
615 2018-05-09 18:03:10 @TED_Bear every stock could do that. Not just ROKU. So by your argument no one should ever buy stocks
616 2018-05-09 18:02:52 Crypto is different from stocks. I understand how you can make money from stocks but not from cryptocurrency since it's not really backed by anything.

649 2018-05-09 17:44:53 Don’t follow individual stocks anymore except NVDA. Just remember that 80% of company stocks move in the general direction of the market (unless they recently had a horrible ER).
650 2018-05-09 17:44:23 @XiaomiIndia your flash sale strategy is good for you but somehow you are loosing some old regular customers. Instead People are buying huawei/ asus/etc. devices. Unless you have enough stocks, don't disappoint customers. You may take my view positively.
651 2018-05-09 17:44:14 $IBB up 1.5%, and $XBI up 2%. Time to sell some longs, and add shorts. I expect market will frustrate for years. Too many public biotech companies now. I have nearly 600 stocks in my database. There were only 300 ten years ago. The quality of biotech IPOs are deteriorating.
652 2018-05-09 17:43:53 I hope @Novartis stocks tank today.
653 2018-05-09 17:43:39 Where is this money? Do you own stocks and shares? Have property or a car? Or spend it on chicken shops and weed?
654 2018-05-09 17:43:33 What a beauty day in markets. All sectors on a tear.  Weed stocks nice comeback on the small caps.  $vhi $sns $loto $ate $grat $sx $mmj $egl $ppr on #watchlist among others like $kash me outside and $rtn $mkt #oil flying love it
655 2018-05-09 17:43:29 Same thinking from those who buying stocks presently, at these insane valuations.   Maybe it is different this time?  Maybe the fed really is bigger than the mkt
656 2018-05-09 17:43:09 Despite trading stocks 90% of my read are futures traders. Less noise, much more value. And still for free! lol. 6 month ago i thought statistics is a waste of time.
657 2018-05-09 17:42:43 Great stuff Cath - I think you'll get loads out of it.
658 2018-05-09 17:42:31 Q: How do you know when stocks are getting cheap?
A: Wall Street is called Wal-Mart Street.
659 2018-05-09 17:41:55 #PennyStocks Remember playing poker and having a potential straight flush with one more card to turn - do you go all in betting on hope? ... what happens when the card does not flip your way? penny stocks can be like betting on hope. don't go all in betting on hope.

671 2018-05-09 17:37:41 economy in dire shape, stocks pumped full of QE and ZIRP more at NIRP which fueled baybacks. upcoming crash will make 2008 look like warm up it was. learn about econ and biz cycles and such before not worrying.

So you prevent a 19yo from obtaining an AR-15, but what about a Mini-14 which is the same thing but has wooden stocks and is considered a "ranch rifle"? Nobody is talking about those. What about 20yo's? Where do you draw the line dude? #gunsense

691 2018-05-09 17:32:19 Exactly. After his 3rd stroke my father had to go into a nursing home. To qualify we had to liquidate everything after paying $9,000 a month till his account was empty. The stocks took too long to sell so he received an eviction notice. I raised the roof up in there! So GROSS!
692 2018-05-09 17:32:08 not an apologist, but recall hearing Peter say he doesnt short, is long commodities (ie gold/oil) and long foreign stocks (select)...   I've never heard Peter say he was shorting anything...  I guess being long commodities + foreign equities is hedging against usd

698 2018-05-09 17:28:52 Oh yes they are all very linked. There's a lot of commentary about UK Stocks lagging other global Indexes and perhaps that will play out. With 2018 starting so badly I won't be surprised if the summer is unusually strong  (but of course anything can happen  !!)

987 2018-05-09 15:16:28 The 10-yr Treasury yield jumped back above 3% this morning for the second time since 2013 causing mortgage rates to go up. Bonds came under selling pressure while stocks, saw a pickup in demand, which can undercut appetite for assets perceived as havens like bonds.

But that's was nice about being able to have a civil discussion over the difference of opinions.
990 2018-05-09 15:14:58 Why? We already have capitalism that embraced communism for the supreme rich, and tolerates manipulation of markets, from bonds to stocks, to corporates, plus rising monopolization, etc. Do not confuse capitalism for a market economy. The two are different.

1076 2018-05-09 14:36:12 TA is the study of market psychology, hardly bs. I remember when I traded stocks, it was the naysayers crying fundamentals over TA. If anything, there is no place for fundamentals in crypto, since these aren’t companies we are dealing with.

That isn't right - there is a huge OTC crypto market. In fact the largest trades don't happen on-exchange.
1234 2018-05-09 13:41:56 Trump owns stocks in gas and oil so while our costs will go up at the pump he'll make millions.  Still think he is helping us?
1235 2018-05-09 13:40:56 That trough was caused by the market pricing Brexit risk in. In the same time frame, global stocks are up 50%, GBP is down 10%, and UK GDP growth has been 1.5% per year. Brexit wasn't good for the British or investors.

1297 2018-05-09 13:18:10 From top internet searches by stock traders -- HOW DO I SHORT BAD STOCKS WITHOUT MARGIN ACCOUNT
1298 2018-05-09 13:17:49 $dcix $blnk$uuu Be careful with the shipping stocks. I dont know how many times the boat has sailed but not more than it sank. Gamble at your own risk. Sometimes u get the same thrill just watching. But the thrill can b gone if u in at the wrong time.
1299 2018-05-09 13:17:23 Personally, I see the greatest opportunity in stocks that have good torque to oil but, for non material reasons, have lagged in response to higher oil. Right now, that is CJ, CPG, CNQ.
1300 2018-05-09 13:15:33 Sir, it is good, but model is even better
1301 2018-05-09 13:15:27 Yes. I can do some stuff. Of that finite list of skills "picking stocks" pays the best. (I ran the numbers watching guys draw caricatures in Central Park last weekend. I'd run out of chalk, and life, before I broke even on a career change)
1302 2018-05-09 13:15:05 Because the only fake news are your tweets, where is our “beautiful” and cheaper healthcare? Why did most of the tax cuts go to rich guys who have no intention of creating more jobs as they buy back stocks in companies due to fail with no middle class?
1303 2018-05-09 13:14:10 I'm a little different. I developed a machine learning/neural network program that essentially picks stocks that pop. $DCIX +70% in premarket today. Hope you got in yesterday when we talked. Even yesterday aftermarket was only +3%.
1304 2018-05-09 13:14:07 If you're looking at E&P stocks, and thinking "I've missed it...", you're wrong. The match has been struck, but it hasn't even lit the fuse, yet.
1305 2018-05-09 13:13:12 So basically the Idiot-in-Chief has cost just ONE American company nearly 20 billion dollars in one day. And, that won't include the drop in their stocks because of this. Great job j@ck@ss!!!! I can't wait to see how much more money we lose.

1407 2018-05-09 12:08:49 @EverBilenaPH more stocks of uptiwn red lip&cheek roller pls!
1408 2018-05-09 12:08:43 As much fun as it was to make fun of you and you keep proving my point your idiots now I have to get ready for stocks to open in about hour and half have to do my due diligence if you know what that means 
1409 2018-05-09 12:08:36 "But I deserve a nice car, I work hard!"  What an idiot! Instead of buying a Jaguar, I bought a used chevette.  Now, instead of paying the bank $600/month, I put $600/into stocks.  I only make 50k a year.  Now, 25 years later, I've got MONEY.
1410 2018-05-09 12:07:48 @InwestorkaAmatorka Magda I don’t think options on cheap stocks will make you pesos. Play bigger stocks with catalysts it’s where $ is made

1412 2018-05-09 12:06:05 Reciprocal access 2 fishing grnds is not the big issue - it's relative shares of key stocks that's at the heart of the matter. A little give & take in facing the realities of Brexit is what's needed from both sides. Turn trans period into something meaningful & not a septic sore.
1413 2018-05-09 12:05:39 2683 is my line in the sand for stocks today.  It either busts through it and runs or fails here.  Seeing Euro stocks fade the past hour has me leaning bearish.
1414 2018-05-09 12:05:35 Vous avez des news à propos du rapatriement des stocks d’Or pour lutter face à la montée du dollar ?
1415 2018-05-09 12:05:32 Don't worry. I have a full automated control on most recommended stocks. Signals alert me. If required I will tweet. At such moment though, most r nvr prepared n decide to wait. Ur inquisitveness will make u open to change gears.
1416 2018-05-09 12:03:40 If the middle class would stop buying cigarettes, beer, stupidly expensive CARS and dinner at Olive Garden, and, instead, bought stocks and mutual funds, then they would become rich.  You choose to be poor, and the rich choose to be rich.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is STUPID.

1418 2018-05-09 12:03:21 I tried drawing lines to predict near and long term trends. I did pretty good until Bitconnect got exposed. Now I realize cryptos are similar to stocks, they move more with news.
1419 2018-05-09 12:03:14 What about the optionality dividends provide? Other stocks may represent better investments (value/quality/etc). Perhaps that is worth the tax drag on dividends or more.

1424 2018-05-09 12:00:57 You can't really be this stupid. You think billionaires' entire goal is accumulating fiat? Most of them don't even have the majority of their net worth in fiat, it's mostly stocks, real estate, and other assets. They're better diversified than any crypto holder.

@EconomPic: What do you mean? We've got to sell now!

1535 2018-05-09 10:50:15 On the other side of the ledger, I once did some PR for a pensions expert whose genuine advice was "pensions are pointless because Gordon Brown ruined them"*. So don't worry about it.

*"...get a stocks and shares ISA" was the second half, but this is less reassuring.

1543 2018-05-09 10:40:22 Looks like L1 has borrowed stock from Credit Suisse to either go long or short on BGS... my experience with CS lending stock in one of my stocks in the past has been generally short. In saying that people can go short and get it wrong, MDL is a good example of this.
1544 2018-05-09 10:40:04 The thing is though, if war with Iran happens then the Straights of Hormuz will be blocked and oil will stop flowing. Then this spike in weapons stocks will be a blip on the downwards spiral to hell the West faces....

1657 2018-05-09 08:55:58 Lo q puede pasar es baje, se active la venta a 41, y luego remonte hacia arriba como paso la semana pasada con $SQ y $XPO. Por eso, yo, no sé si hacer q me salte el STOP, y volver a entra a 41, 40 o 39 donde llegue.
1658 2018-05-09 08:55:03 En ese caso me quedo más tranquilo. No me preocupa que me salte el stop a 41. 39 es otra cosa...

1692 2018-05-09 08:33:05 I think visceral examples of value traps make active value managers try too hard to avoid them.

We dislike losing things we have more than gaining those we don't have.

We value something more when we have it than if we don't.

E.g. - We hate to sell losing stocks - it's admitting a mistake.

1990 2018-05-09 03:42:22 @DaveHcontrarian I would say the biggest factor in outperformance on the long side at any time is to recognize the nature of the cycle. Like in late 2011/early 2012, recognizing that collapse of rates/structural growth would lead to chase for secular growth stocks and yielders.
1991 2018-05-09 03:41:05 @DaveHcontrarian Amazing what a run the growth stocks have had in this cycle, not just the techs, but stuff like HD and V.

2145 2018-05-09 01:58:17 People tut-tutting Warren Buffett for buying Apple after a lifetime of eschewing tech stocks need to realize: (1) it wasn't tech stocks per se that he opposed, but rather cash flows that he couldn't confidently estimate; and (2) Apple's $258 billion cash hoard changes everything.
2146 2018-05-09 01:57:41 Sometimes market becomes so confusing...

1. Crude rallying 
2. Bank Nifty rallying 
3. Us-10 yr bond yield @3 percent.
4. Metal stocks rallying.
5. Dollor Index at 5 months high.

As per my experience, this cant sustain for long...

Aviod leverage and wait for a dip

2162 2018-05-09 01:45:34 It’s all about personal risk tolerance, total assets, asset allocation, etc. Mathematically, over the very long run, houses just keep up with inflation while stocks are very much ahead of it.

2224 2018-05-09 00:50:24 I think he probably likes them much better than Bitcoin. The problem he has with Bitcoin is that it’s hurting badly (an threatening with much worse) his stocks. They own a lot of banks which are loosing a lot of fees due to bitcoin.

2233 2018-05-09 00:39:31 Once value comes back in favor, won't those stocks turn into growth stocks (as price increases faster than the denominators) and then momentum continues putting growth in favor until it goes too far, etc, etc. Seems to be an inevitable cycle.
