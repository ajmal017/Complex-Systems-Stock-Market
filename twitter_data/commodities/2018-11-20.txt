50 2018-11-20 22:08:59 3. That he wants to grow economy by risking inflation.. His supporters who have been sharing posts on rise in prices of commodities since 2015 would need to start defending the need for inflation as a necessity for economic growth.

59 2018-11-20 21:37:27 Taxing owners for not using land or for the perceived value of natural resources incentivizes over-harvesting of timber and other commodities, especially private party (non corporate) smaller landholders. California tried it -to disastrous results.

80 2018-11-20 20:16:39 The prevailing advice is to sell off, back to the safety of cash as commodities (inc Gold) aren’t faring well either. 

I can’t help but feel there’s a correlation between the decline of FAANG stock and crypto. A lot of the same people in both spaces and some are spooked.

93 2018-11-20 19:28:53 No imbecil... hubo más ingresos en el Ecuador por el boom de los commodities por el crecimiento de las economías asiáticas en especial China, lo que provoca que las economías primarias como la ecuatoriana se beneficien del aumento del precio del petróleo
94 2018-11-20 19:26:48 Obviamente tudo pode. Para fazer uma comparação melhor, tem que expurgar do S&P o setor de tecnologia responsável acho que por 80% da performance. O Bovespa pouco tem esse setor. Aí a comparação muda totalmente. 70% no IBov é commodities e financeiro oligopolizado.

97 2018-11-20 19:20:38 I dont know either TBH. I look at commodities purely from the top down macro demand side. If I see that market perception of demand is at variance to mine, only then I take a view. Not based on supply.
98 2018-11-20 19:17:20 For now, agreed.  Challenge is that on current course, we are heading towards a most curious phenomenon: Commodities that are cheap v. a strong USD, but physically-unavailable at the quoted USD price.
99 2018-11-20 19:17:18 Interesante, sobre todo que si hay algo que sobre en el mundo es el acero. Seguramente una hábil actividad comercial. Otra sería hacer stock si hubo buen precio de MP e insumos. ¡Son commodities!
100 2018-11-20 19:15:35 The shadow world of college Athletics is hard to find. But ultimately it's a multi billion dollar business that exploits young athletes who are treated like disposable commodities. That's why they lurk in the dark corners like vampires.
101 2018-11-20 19:14:28 It seems like there’s a deeper truth to Reddit’s satirical Meme Economy (i.e. discussing memes as if they are commodities or capital assets with fluctuating values).

Wondering if anyone has written about this at length.
102 2018-11-20 19:13:35 Hi Roger, thank you for getting in touch. Unfortunately, key commodities like coffee have risen sharply and we’ve had to make a cost price increase. Retail pricing is at the sole discretion of the retailer.
103 2018-11-20 19:11:49 I saw someone today saying buying oil is easy money here ...... commodities aint easy folks
104 2018-11-20 18:58:37 I would make a deal with the Mets if they came to the table with rationale trade offers. They can dangle Thor all they want, in my mind he's damages goods with upside. And pitchers are very volatile commodities. But let's be realistic here.
105 2018-11-20 18:44:46 Basta mirar cómo se han comportado los precios de los commodities (Cobre, Azúcar, Petróleo, Oro, Gas) para ver como no ha quedado focalizada, sino que más bien se ha expandido a todo el mundo. En una guerra comercial no hay ganadores.
106 2018-11-20 18:44:39 Right? But who’d ever guess a surfer boy from Los Altos CA who became a commodities broker, moving us around the world would end up like this? It’s Fox & moving out to the Central Valley. Sad. Mom’s probably turning in her grave.

109 2018-11-20 18:32:12 The diff between rent and commodity profit margin is the ability to resell the same data & to get paid continuously.
Even still, most agree that there is plenty of opportunity for those who use commodities in industry.
If data adds no value, it has no value.
110 2018-11-20 18:29:08 I actually favor the use of information and time as currency drivers rather than commodities since we are now entering the information age..
I am still drafting it.. It has a lot of Whatifs.. But it's a curious approach
111 2018-11-20 18:29:00 This is a familiar argument in Canada, not much different from the business model of any commodity producer. Other economic analogies also follow.
The great boon to data controllers is that, unlike physical commodities, data can be resold many times. But data also goes stale.
112 2018-11-20 18:27:46 I think you're right. Price and branding are primary drivers. Labor and environmental impact are secondary drivers that you'll consider when deciding between commodities @ifyonyegbule @DailyReport @starfm101_5
113 2018-11-20 18:22:38 Jesus. Commodities are getting wrecked today. 

Oil is off 7%. The entire GSCI commodity complex is down 4%
114 2018-11-20 18:16:19 Climate goals are an idea of postmodernism. Postmodernism is a mixture of really bad failed socialism. The rest is climate change, identity politics, no borders, etc. Its a really bad idea to embed this in the own way. We need uranium to save the more valuable Commodities!
115 2018-11-20 18:07:36 Like all commodities, price is controlled by supply and demand. Anyone who says it's not are just stupid!
116 2018-11-20 18:04:22 Yes, they do actually. If Fidelity allowed a scam to peddle shares by circumventing listing requirements, they'd be in trouble. This gets tricky because the deeper underlying issues with crypto, like people pretending these are commodities when they are securities if centralized.
117 2018-11-20 18:02:47 The problem with obsolescence is that Apple stops updating older (powerful) devices so customers will buy a newer one. I won't pay $800+ for hardware I have no control over and will be unsupported in a few years. However smartphones are commodities, so it's a matter of preference
118 2018-11-20 18:00:02 Commodities: Brent -5.54%, Natural gas -5.43%
119 2018-11-20 17:58:41 Wrong Dr Craig S Wright is Right!!! Precious metal value in dollars, euro or vs other commodities is based on consumption supply in demand there is plenty of gold not running out anytime soon lol. BCHSV is ment to be a payment method digital cash than can scale globally with ease
120 2018-11-20 17:58:03 I think you're right. Price and branding are primary drivers. Labor and environmental impact are secondary drivers that you'll consider when deciding between commodities IMO
121 2018-11-20 17:57:05 APC change mantra. 
Wasn't it to change the living conditions of people for better?

Let's see. 
1. Prices of food commodities- change to worse.
2. Poverty level status- change to worse.
3. Unemployment -change to worse.
4. Nigeria -change to worse.
@KakaakiSocial
122 2018-11-20 17:51:36 but i would say its different with commodities insofar as they are uv's produced for exchange they are integuments of law?
123 2018-11-20 17:49:41 what black Friday means in Zimbabwe is getting basic commodities at gazzetted price period
124 2018-11-20 17:49:29 And I've got you AMAZING presents which you won't get if you give my presents away. I don't give a shit about your importance hierarchy of friends, if all we are are commodities to you then you can drown in your own cranberry juice as i eat cake and smile.
125 2018-11-20 17:45:44 well even if there are uv in capitalism that aren't commodities they are legally regulated in some way right? and they may have even been made for that purpose (like open source software? .... i'm not a law guy)
126 2018-11-20 17:44:23 Welcome to Ghana, Where Commodities prices shoots up, but, Salaries remain the same.

129 2018-11-20 17:42:01 ah, i was just saying commodities are law all the way down to their uv dimension, but not all uv. But then i realized this might be true at least on a formal level.
130 2018-11-20 17:33:33 so it seems to me that when commodities are produced/exchanged/consumed in capitalist totality law is inseparable from each of their dimensions. (use values on their own are different)
131 2018-11-20 17:32:04 it seems to me like your answering the q. what role did law play in constituting the commodity form? I think I am thinking about what role law has in the production of commodities i.e. accumulation/reproduction.
132 2018-11-20 17:30:01 Commodities is also a Vix, #thinkaboutit
133 2018-11-20 17:28:16 Isn’t a VAT tax the way to go?  Let’s protect finished goods over commodities like steel. Think about the value of the steel that goes into a car; a few hundred bucks out of $25K?  What business is better?
134 2018-11-20 17:25:18 I mean the commodity form, the commodity-ness of commodities. I'm unsure about the constitution/reproduction point, can you expand?
135 2018-11-20 17:23:44 Oil is now trading around 63$ growing concerns about slowing global growth and OPEC reportedly remained undecided on the size of production cut. American markets are down. Let's see how Asian markets react tomorrow.  #crude #commodities
136 2018-11-20 17:12:35 They would take more of our exports, the stuff they can copy; pharma, Bio Tech, Aircraft, etc.  and our commodities as if we are simply a colony.  Our elites jumped on this as a easy arbitrage of wages, and then stuck us with the deficits, to boot. 2-2
137 2018-11-20 17:05:03 3194: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
138 2018-11-20 17:03:51 LOL 

The people that can't actually trade (amateur or professional) that have been riding this market up will be the first out. 

Side note: I think it's crazy to pair trade commodities  but that's not my circle of excellence anyhow-
139 2018-11-20 17:02:34 Not true. Farming tells us this. When we worked with animal power, we treated animals as creatures worthy of empathy.  With industrial agriculture we treat animals cruelly as commodities. The more we live apart from animals the more we act like machines. A far worse fate.
140 2018-11-20 16:59:03 maybe I am thinking about commodities and you are thinking about the commodity form. constitution v reproduction.
141 2018-11-20 16:55:00 (2) I could b misunderstanding what you mean by legally constituted, but if we distinguish between the genesis of the totality and  totality, I don't see how it could be the case that commodities are not legally constituted including their use values
142 2018-11-20 16:52:55 The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top

161 2018-11-20 15:52:54 Monetizing such sales will be the key. Hopefully what Richard Liu said about next year profitability will come true. Moving beyond electronics goods is also crucial. That’s just way too commodities n competitive segment.
162 2018-11-20 15:51:52 And even AMZN stock price crashed when dotcom bubble burst. But what’s the difference between commodities & companies?

Yes, $.02.

Fundamental strong position, thereby the difference.

Commodities, things the world needs.
165 2018-11-20 15:48:17 Before the last global market crash, the commodities market went down- as a precursor. On a related note, with institutional investors getting into crypto, expect them to bring along non-crypto-related market forces and risk to the equation. good or bad? Not too sure..
166 2018-11-20 15:43:08 La economía global está perdiendo el impulso y le está pasando la cuenta a los diferentes clases de activos (acciones, commodities y etc). El mundo podría haber sido mejor si junto con el retiro de los estímulos monetarios, las economías hubiesen mostrado q se están expandiendo.
167 2018-11-20 15:41:17 In class we were talking commodities for men v. women. Students laughed about 3 in 1 shower gel. I told them how my dad is cheap and used to try to get me to use that instead of seperate shampoo/conditioner. Then said "but I'm an adult now and buy what I want!" And they cheered.

181 2018-11-20 15:18:26 absolutely, the QE anthology stoked commodities hard!  At the same time it stoked shale oil drilling (fueled by debt) and subsequently led the oil price to collapse.  no matter what the nice thing about a recession is it drop kicks the Demand of S/D for every commodity

207 2018-11-20 14:19:05 A small addendum to the 1929-1949 period: The Dow bottomed against Commodities in 1949 (the peak being 1929 like in the Dow Gold Ratio) which nets a nice clean 20 year secular equity bear market. I still equate 2000 with the 1929 bubble, therefore 2020 is the projected bottom.
208 2018-11-20 14:17:46 I said this last week & I'll repeat it: Trump thinks his "report card" is the stock market, so he'll make some half-assed deal with China and call it "a great victory." Stocks will pop then reenter a bear market. The place to be positioned for this is agricultural commodities.

Because of this, it can only be priced speculatively, unlike commodities

222 2018-11-20 13:43:45 Money is backed by commodities. There has to he be a tangible value tied to the money. If money exists without being backed by something tangible or of utility then it’s just most likely backed by a mercenary force.
223 2018-11-20 13:42:24 personally I think of open borders as the kind of transitional demand, pointed squarely at one of the key contradictions, that has potential to catalyze a deeper transformation. the mobility of capital and commodities and the immobility of labor defines contemporary capitalism.

226 2018-11-20 13:36:13 I wish I could have been more positive but much like futures, currencies, and commodities, when faced with pressures due to speculation rather than evidence, you can't win. 

Even with evidence like Asheville, the echo chamber may never die...just get smaller...which is my hope.
227 2018-11-20 13:32:36 #BoKaap this is not just about residents not wanting high rise buildings. this story is so much more. its about land and housing having become commodities to be sold off to the highest bidder.
228 2018-11-20 13:25:00 Stocks, commodities, bond spreads, decades of supressed wages, outrageous cost of living, tRUMP dumb tariffs, all those factors will slow growth. Its inevitable

230 2018-11-20 13:19:06 I would suggest all the contesting for MLA in telangana, do stick to ur promises after forming the govt.  people expect minimum requirement.  1. reasonable price to necessary commodities 2. improve infrastructure  3. improve living standards 4. minimize/reduce corruption.
231 2018-11-20 13:11:44 Whether it's stocks, commodities, bond spreads .. "you're seeing increasing concern about recession," says Leuthold Group's Paulsen. "I think that's feeding through into Fed probabilities. I think it's one of the things driving this market down."

Zak threatened illegal behavior & thought it was funny. Even the threat of revenge porn is traumatizing and harassing, and therapy inducing. If you continue to promote him for ratings or cast him, you are complicit in a culture where women's bodies are commodities
233 2018-11-20 13:07:53 You're missing the point. CNN gave Hillary cover and presumption of innocence, commodities they did not afford the opposition. If Ivanka broke rules, check it but if she burns before Hillary's security breaches and rape of Haiti, it's not justice. Stop pretending it's not revenge
234 2018-11-20 12:59:56 The biggest problem in the USSR was crises of underproduction (ie. scarcity). This is understandable given the material poverty of the Soviet Union but contrasts sharply with the capitalist norm towards crises of *overproduction*; excess commodities being produced but not sold.
235 2018-11-20 12:59:20 With my limited knowledge that would be government debt (bonds) and commodities (Gold / Silver). Of course you need to do research to determine which would provide the best return for how long you wish to hold.
236 2018-11-20 12:59:19 não por mérito do Lula, agradeça à China e aos preços das commodities que bombaram nessa época e encheram o Brasil de dólares, fora isso, ele só fez merda e dilapidou a grana toda a serviço do capital financeiro
237 2018-11-20 12:55:16 The word “sexless” is definitively non-gendered,  “bloodless” is a-political; both words are non-essentialist in any sense of a political connotation. “Bad word choice” in this context is just “bad PR” and so only counts for commodities. People are exempt.
238 2018-11-20 12:55:03 Either you understand that gold is money or you consider the $, €, ¥, £, et al to be commodities. Anything else ignores de facto reality.
239 2018-11-20 12:52:47 Particularly in these uncertain times where commodities are a more attractive way of maintaining the value of ones money
240 2018-11-20 12:52:21 Because APC failed us as a nation the Change begin with me mantra was a Scam and quickly discarded
 when it comes to Ganduje, Barbachir Lawal etc. PDP never claimed to be better without flaws and comparing 2010-2015 of PDP and 2015-2018 of APC commodities prices ve risen up.

Senile Madey is severely out of his mind blabbering COCK & BULL STORY .v wld instead strongly suggested we mend the strained bilateral tie (if any) amicably & diplomatically with China which may help to alleviate the record low price of commodities @teresakok
242 2018-11-20 12:45:56 It's only reasonable why some don't patronize your businesses. You people inflate prices on commodities that can be gotten for less in the real market. Products much better than yours but you guys won't just accept reality of being just and fair on your goods
243 2018-11-20 12:45:09 What combustible commodities are my people hoarding and storing in their shops and backyards?
244 2018-11-20 12:40:18 I'm not saying Farmers aren't guided by markets... who is market? Who sets the terms? Who holds the power in making decisions about what is grown, where and in what ways? Many farmers over the years have told me in industrial system, choices limited by "economics" of commodities-
245 2018-11-20 12:24:15 Before the Annapurna Bhandar scheme came in, the sale of limited commodities at the ration shops had reduced the income of the dealers.

249 2018-11-20 12:00:26 Goods/essential commodities go from there to the entire country. If the roads end up being unpassable then almost a 1,000 trucks will end up going through Lagos to the interstate express, then we end up with another Apapa gridlock
250 2018-11-20 11:56:48 I've never thought to price commodities in #SDR. It may provide a more balanced and clean perspective of the moves and directions the primary market makes. Thank you
251 2018-11-20 11:44:45 What platform do you use for trading commodities?
252 2018-11-20 11:43:50 Right now Ripple have a case in the Federal Court that could literally become the next 'Howey test' for whether digital assets are classed as securities, commodities or some new class. Do you see any other crypto companies ponying up for top class legal team to work on that?
253 2018-11-20 11:36:40 But the question remains what happens to the demonetized notes.  Not sure, but rbi can keep it as reserves or could purchase debentures/commodities.
254 2018-11-20 11:34:48 he got arrested?! oh shit.

256 2018-11-20 11:32:25 There are so many platforms where people use Bitcoin to trade FX and commodities, but the profits (if any) are in terms of Bitcoin and they just get negated because of the falling crypto. A loss makes it twice as bad. Ridiculous.

260 2018-11-20 11:06:19 Commodities are the opium of the people.

265 2018-11-20 10:48:16 Fellow Zimbabweans don't worry basic commodities will be available owing to suspension of Statutory Instrument 122 of 2017. People can bring in basic commodities without an import licence.

271 2018-11-20 10:30:02 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
272 2018-11-20 10:21:01 For those who don't know 
Speculators make money from volatility
Yes, they can actually profit from the negative price movement of most commodities as well as upward price movement

Shorting & Longing
273 2018-11-20 10:10:40 EU FTA’s are based on free market economics and therefore prey on the values on commodities made by businesses, which have seen cost of living soar and wages stagnate. Since the 70s I might add. 

Again, the question 

Do you support the notion of internationalism?
274 2018-11-20 09:56:34 Animals are not things. They are not commodities. They should never be seen as property and assets. Our attitudes are backward and barbaric if we cannot respect other lives. #vegan

Yours is to go for the cheaper and not complain over her somewhat over priced stuffs, it’s clearly not for you. Except you really like it and if you do then buy it. Capitalism is quite interesting.
279 2018-11-20 09:25:54 impact of trade war increases, inflated growth expectations will correct. Stocks, real estate, corporate debt (especially low grade) and commodities are now reacting to this. But signs were there for a while. Now the sell-off is gathering pace.

295 2018-11-20 07:34:49 I think if we could start with tax reduction on the networks, currency stabilisation, direct foreign investment, reduction of import duties and provision of basic commodities before comparing Zimbabwe to regional trends. I'm sure that's the job for MPs sitting in parliament.

303 2018-11-20 07:10:01 Buhari is not the cause for rise in the prices of commodities but we the people are. the recent clamour for increase of minimum wage is an example of this. It'll lead to inflation. What we need is establishment of manufacturing industries and exporting.
304 2018-11-20 07:03:44 We're talking about the problem of diabetes, obesity, and CVD with the Tongans and Samoans that DONT do that stuff because of the Western brand of Capitalism that brought wage paying jobs as well as Western commodities. And I 100% agree mui pipi can be given all to the Samoans
305 2018-11-20 07:02:11 There is connection for sure. In economics of international trade the demand for our cashewnuts plus other commodities = demand for our shilling'. Therefore when our cashewnuts find no buyer it means nobody wants our shilling and therefore the shilling loses value (depreciates)

323 2018-11-20 05:34:15 The S&P is way more diversified.  It will almost always be that way especially when commodities get beaten up. If you have all your money in Canada, those are bad investment decisions.  More money should be in the S&P.

326 2018-11-20 05:17:12 Incarceration feeds a vast network of private industries, supplying everthing from food to surveillance devices. The prisoners are commodities in this scheme, the basis for the carceral economy. Firefighters get outside once in a while, but others serve the economy in cages.
327 2018-11-20 05:13:18 Is Not true for this. When GEJ was in power Nigerians made a mistake by pushing him out. Now we all regret it. The common Nigerian is suffering. Hunger everywhere. Commodities prices skyrocketed. Let's just be wise this time.

Some people will abuse, but generally speaking, we don’t prevent people from selling an excess of most other commodities (ignoring specially regulated industries and the like, like gas), it seems off to do so on tokens.
333 2018-11-20 04:56:32 That comes with experience, takes years. To be honest, I was lucky in a sense. I used to trade small lots as an individual trader. But the firm I headed, the MD @dalmia_info  of Proficient Commodities continuously supported in trading big for the firm.

336 2018-11-20 04:46:50 Saying bye is never easy: one of the biggest sacrifices I took wasn’t leaving the commodities I had in my former home of Bogota: it was the presence of my parents and siblings.
337 2018-11-20 04:25:57 Chia never trades from a position of power. He sees an average player go on a scoring streak and thinks he's finally turned into a star. His judgement is questionable. He drafted Lucic, Spooner,  He needs to think of his players as commodities to make good trades.
338 2018-11-20 04:23:44 I remember the “talking heads” on CNBC nearly Scolding you for warning people about what Sub Prime, coupled with “credit card wars” was about to do to Global Financials - think we should also recognize Brooksley Bourne for trying to regulate Derivatives at the Commodities Board
339 2018-11-20 03:57:36 In general it created density along the skytrain line and with it some of the additional commodities. I think it's debatable if it brought in actual 'businesses'. Plus the route is already fairly built up, especially through Clayton and Fleetwood where it's all new development.
340 2018-11-20 03:50:29 Imo if one is doing options on Individual stocks or commodities , it is always good to spreads
341 2018-11-20 03:31:48 The Billionaires Secret
Short or hold cash at the top of cycles in Stocks, Real Estate Commodities and Private Companies.
Then buy forced selling after the crash for 25 to 33 cents on the dollar 
Rinse Repeat
342 2018-11-20 03:16:50 Você conhece sobre ineficiência dentro do mercado agrícola? Abertura de mercado e tecnologia? Explique melhor, porque os ineficientes que conheci já quebraram no setor de grãos, principalmente depois da ferrugem asiática e helicoverpa. Você conhece o mercado de commodities agro?
343 2018-11-20 03:11:56 Great news as e RBZ Chief #Mangudya has assured e nation tht Gvnt wl ensure tht basic commodities are available during e festive season. Only wsh e prices wl normalise as wel bt kudos to Gvnt fo lookin out fo us...

My price is a compromise 
My pay is peace
345 2018-11-20 02:59:12 Human meat is also tasty and healthier. Will you eat humans? Fish feel pain and suffer, & killing them for human greed for taste & pleasure is WRONG. Stop looking at animals as commodities. Go visit a factory farm where they raise fishes unnaturally.
346 2018-11-20 02:49:06 How do people not know how commodities work?
347 2018-11-20 02:45:53 It's really depressing right now.The scary part is people are not joking. My brother equities, cryptos, and commodities are all down and he's actually been talking like this. It's not funny and people's life savings are on the line. Suicide rate always go up during these times.

352 2018-11-20 02:04:12 Commodities Trading Results (A) - WTI oil:-

353 2018-11-20 01:53:18 That's not how commodities like players really work.  Just bc Otto costs 2.5x more than Moe doesn't mean he needs to be 2.5x better for it to be equal value.  Is El Gaucho's steak really 20x better than a fast food chain?  Is a supercar really 10x better than a Toyota Camry?

356 2018-11-20 01:43:35 Worse then most commodities
357 2018-11-20 01:39:30 Yes, I have. As well as The Girls Who Went Away. This is actually my info, though. Can I talk about this without bringing my mother into it, thanks. I understand that mothers were hurt, but adoptees are the commodities left behind. My mother actually didn’t give a shit.
358 2018-11-20 01:37:57 Never would have thunk. Continue the good analysis, Larry! I'm listening. Sold SH way too early. About 35% equities. Some short long-term treasuries and commodities. Losses very manageable. Trend following saving my arse..
359 2018-11-20 01:36:45 Já estourou porém quando a bolha é a dívida soberana, não acontece um grande crash, mas uma queda lenta nos preços dos ativos, como estamos vendo, e a estagflação global. Commodities estão só mostrando como a desaceleração global está vindo. Eurozone já dando os maiores sinais.

363 2018-11-20 01:25:25 While I agree with the sentiment, I believe it’s more worthwhile to compare Ethereum Network Value to something more analagous, such as:

- M1 base money
- USD
- Gold
- Monetary premium on commodities
- SoV premium of global real estate

368 2018-11-20 00:45:01 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
369 2018-11-20 00:25:15 Credit systems that do not depend on rare valuable commodities are very old. Using gold or livestock as a medium of exchange is very inefficient, which is why we don’t usually use gold or livestock when we want to buy a pint of milk.
370 2018-11-20 00:23:04 Quero saber das propostas para indústria. Pq só se fala em agro é isso, agro é tudo. Agro everywhere. Otimismo da indústria está no escuro. Esperando a hora de parar a acomodação na eterna exportação de commodities.
371 2018-11-20 00:19:55 There are no more bank runs, because deposits are FDIC insured. A bank run will only happen if the dollar collapses and people FUD into bitcoin/gold/commodities.
372 2018-11-20 00:12:51 Museums being commodities not missions.
373 2018-11-20 00:12:46 Go into commodities
374 2018-11-20 00:10:50 Sale el sol
Sube el dólar
El transito es un caos
Hay inflación
Los medios embrutecen al pueblo
Los commodities no suben de precio
Pronto llegará el verano 

Y luego dicen que no hay "persecución politica" !!! .... Ya pues !!!
375 2018-11-20 00:10:03 Ante la incertidumbre por el talante del nuevo Gobierno, los mexicanos creen que la mejor inversión para protección patrimonial son los inmuebles locales. ERROR. Son los inmuebles y las cuentas en el extranjero en economías de primer mundo y los commodities. Tomen dato. Gratis.
376 2018-11-20 00:06:08 You don't have a right to commodities.
377 2018-11-20 00:01:02 Tienen razón en no aceptar.
El cambio debe incluir desmontar ese modelo de estado administrador de commodities.
