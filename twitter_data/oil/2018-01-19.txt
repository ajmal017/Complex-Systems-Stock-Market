43 2018-01-20 23:56:03 Lol what a joke... Private business can and would do all better. We don't need a government Mommy and Daddy
44 2018-01-20 23:55:44 Si, la economía de escala es una falacia, fíjese que a Standard Oil la reemplazaron micropymes.
45 2018-01-20 23:55:41 “places like this aren’t run by the man” 
“what man?”
“the man-man. the man who, you know, owns all the oil, forces chinese children to make smartphones, and hates palestine.”
 WE HAVE DECIDED TO STAN FOR LIFE
46 2018-01-20 23:55:37 My wife said coconut oil should remove it.

59 2018-01-20 23:53:58 “Too worried about offending Turkey.”  The same Turkey that with its oil-for-gold scheme enabled Iran evade sanctions.  Or how about giving sanctuary to 100’s of ISIS fighters.  Or buying ~$B in oil from ISIS. Or actively supporting Hamas.
60 2018-01-20 23:53:51 This man really trying to burn me with the oil cause he mad that I’m quiet....Bruhh  boy bye

65 2018-01-20 23:52:41 Bow Valley goes up 4-0 but a really quick response by Hefferan makes it 4-1
66 2018-01-20 23:52:36 Yes but we have plenty of production as is for continued development. We don't need to be the leading oil producers to compete. We're smarter and far more resourceful than that we have other value as a nation than just sucking dead dinos out of the earth. #InovatioNotPropagation

72 2018-01-20 23:51:27 Yes oil price was down. But remember when the whole world suffered economic crunch, pdp managed to keep Nigeria going. Am tired of talking now. No one is paying me. You can believe what you like.
73 2018-01-20 23:51:26 En USA cuando el gobierno desmanteló la megaempresa Stardard Oil no se acabó la industria del petróleo. Solo falacias.
74 2018-01-20 23:51:19 You wouldn't expect Kellogg's to endorse a cereal free diet so why would you expect their marketing department (dietitians) to do it? That's like expecting Big Oil to support Tesla.

161 2018-01-20 23:35:19 Hey president cheeto:  Please explain why gas prices keep going up. Oil is still cheap right?
162 2018-01-20 23:35:16 That’s a regular life hack when you run out of gel..mix it with some oil to get that good slick 
163 2018-01-20 23:35:05 Florida has decided to ease up some of the regulations on medical marijuana specifically with CBD oil that would give such great relief from nerve pain. They've also decided to make it Out Of Reach because of the cost. Of course they did.
164 2018-01-20 23:34:49 3 decades is too long, by 2025, France and some other European countries plan to stop using petrol powered cars and start using Electric powered cars. Nigeria will start planning by 2026, after using 2025, to pass blames. 
Crude oil would soon be treated like coal.

People don't get to hear this perspective very often and it's important that they do. Living with the loss of a child (no matter what the reason) is nothing I wish on anyone and I am so sorry you carry this with you. Stay strong brotha 
168 2018-01-20 23:34:33 My dad just told me that the mafia is in control of all of the pure olive oil in the world. That's why you can't get it

180 2018-01-20 23:32:53 Took my car to @jiffylube for an oil change, got car back worse than before - I’ve also heard stories of @jiffylube employees forgetting to put oil in and not putting on the oil cap, consequently causing oil to spurt - want to pay someone to mess your car up? go to @jiffylube
181 2018-01-20 23:32:52 Every time I hear jojoba oil I think of Star Wars....don’t know why
182 2018-01-20 23:32:46 Found this a bit defeatist. And it’s not like the 100 battle for oil hasn’t created a few problems with human rights. Consumer take up and investment will solve these problems a lot quicker then we’ve seen with the vehicles we’ve been driving for so long.
183 2018-01-20 23:32:14 olive oil is king 
184 2018-01-20 23:32:11 We need the United Nations to have strict regulations on these "accidents" I suggest penalizing by charging 75% of what the oil/etc was worth, that will help with the clean up and put regulations by forcing them to not move as much, preferably moving their capacity level down 35%
185 2018-01-20 23:31:40 About 5-8 drops of Oregano oil in about 4 oz of water 2-3 times a day. Its STRONG but it kills a sore throat situation.
186 2018-01-20 23:31:19 Rub ur face with some sweet almond oil 
187 2018-01-20 23:31:18 And this leaving the single market of 63% of our trade is ridiculous   Scotland has oil and gas in abundance,you think no one will trade with us?????

189 2018-01-20 23:31:07 im actually craving nutrients. yea i like the taste of pizza—who the fuck doesn’t—but i spent the whole week fantasizing about unseasoned sautéed spinach and mushroom with no oil so what’s up
190 2018-01-20 23:31:04 Hot water with half and orange squeezed, squeeze touch of lemon, honey, dash cinnamon, dash cayenne. Rotate with/ add green tea in the mix. Dabs of eucalyptus or mint oil on pressure points.

197 2018-01-20 23:30:18 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
198 2018-01-20 23:30:15 I'm suggesting cutting some regulations benefit businesses and harm environment. So permit oil drilling off coasts but ruin tourist ind. I remember LA businesses dependent on fishing suffered after BP.  Goodbye

200 2018-01-20 23:30:14 Keep up your oral health with cloves! #Cloves have anti-inflammatory and anti-septic properties due to its eugenol component, it may help relieve inflammation and pain from gingivitis.

210 2018-01-20 23:27:48 It puts a lot of oil in the tank for the rest of the year.
211 2018-01-20 23:27:39 Sometimes I love living in the countryside. Sometimes, like now, when I’ve misjudged the heating oil situation and we run out - not so great. Bugger.
212 2018-01-20 23:27:31 You know you are fed up with a cold when the idea of smothering yourself with raw garlic and coconut oil begins to look appealing. Very appealing.
213 2018-01-20 23:27:30 This particular user is pushing the bull case hard expects oil to go to 90 
214 2018-01-20 23:27:20 Why did the oil last the Israelites 8 days?

218 2018-01-20 23:26:42 Ginger and tumeric shot with a squeeze of lemon for the sore throat. I have never found an effective migraine relief but peppermint oil rubbed on and in a diffuser often help me function (opens blood vessels)

224 2018-01-20 23:25:44 If you use Jamaican black castor oil instead 1) it’s thinner so you only need a little and you won’t go blind 2) it makes your brows and lashes grow hella long if you use it regularly (I’ve personally used it and it 100% works) btw you can get it at Sally’s
225 2018-01-20 23:25:37 Sure. I didn't like having the vision I still have left. Why not put oil in my eyes for 3 months? 
226 2018-01-20 23:25:26 Nice try but we ain’t buying. Sell snake oil somewhere else traitor. Check polls and streets today. You are losing.
227 2018-01-20 23:25:20 The central banks have already moved in. The world will soon trade oil in the Yuan... The usa is headed for the biggest crash ever especially when the whole world realises they don't need the $ to trade oil. China will become the new Rome and it's been planned for a long time.
228 2018-01-20 23:25:10 For the headache, mint oil rubbed on the temples should immediately provide relief. Sore throat: green tea with lemon and honey. Ginsing for energy.

243 2018-01-20 23:23:30 3/ then look at how much profit those same oil companies left the province with under CON leadership. which is still the case. all of it is moot. earlier you mentioned that they are all elites. which we both agree on. now given the CONs 40yr history why is it so bad to try some

Pickles and olive oil. That's it. I don't need them immediately and they're on sale through the 30th. Not bad at all.

I have the Jewel app. I should make my list there.

261 2018-01-20 23:20:45 wait which is more iconic, white flower oil, po chai oil, or Axe brand medicinal oil...
262 2018-01-20 23:20:39 Indeed. I'll feel more confident as EV and battery production gains substantial scale. Particularly commercial EV production capacity would be critical for countering a rapidly emerging shortage. We really don't want trucking to shut down when the oil price is critically high.

301 2018-01-20 23:16:19 IMF Externalities on the net.  Pollution from coal and oil increase health care costs by trillions over time.  When will State Legislatures, Congress fine oil companies, coal companies for trillions of dollars in damages past, future Medicaid, Medicare?
302 2018-01-20 23:16:07 Mine shed within four days which was frustrating... Other people say they last around 2-3 weeks so maybe I just got unlucky. I had to remove the rest with baby oil which didn’t work and I lost most of my real eyelashes too unfortunately 
303 2018-01-20 23:16:04 This shows how little Russia know of Turkey.  They are blinded by oil and gas and isn't Afrin where they want a pipeline to go through to Turkey?

305 2018-01-20 23:15:48 I’ll be sick of wild salmon, “cage free” eggs, cucumbers, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil in eight days.
306 2018-01-20 23:15:33 I fully support the Women's March and their goals to get free birth control and close the wage gap.
I can't wait to have my condoms taxpayer funded, and to see women working longer hours and more dangerous jobs in the coal mines and oil fields.

You go girls!

320 2018-01-20 23:13:22 Try olive oil or an acetone - Palmolive might work - soak.  I used to work with something kind of similar - it could take a few days to break down.
321 2018-01-20 23:13:20 Oh...sooo... you're a bot. Got it. Get your oil checked. I think it's low.

327 2018-01-20 23:12:50 No! Orange peel. And only the peel, not the fruit or the juice. The oil in the peel reacts with the gin. The juice does not.

330 2018-01-20 23:12:15 9/ and really the oil boom was only 6 years long... from 2004 - 2010ish.. it was less than $40/barrel from 1986 - 2003.
331 2018-01-20 23:12:12 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
332 2018-01-20 23:12:11 8/ highway 2 used to be? Remember the rebate checks we used to get? We don't get those anymore because we have to pay the ever increasing debt. Klien might have been in an oil boom but the prices per barrel were 1/2 of what they are now,

352 2018-01-20 23:09:28 Some back and forth chances to start the first. Bow Valley goes up 1-0.
353 2018-01-20 23:09:23 I say this with all humility. But there’s been an increase in oil on this side. So just get ready for some fire.
354 2018-01-20 23:09:20 Baby oil? 
355 2018-01-20 23:09:14 U have been negative about oil since $28 a barrel.  It's $60+.  Think momentum on side of bulls.  Tide changed

360 2018-01-20 23:08:17 ok i was just reading about exactly these two things on itg when i tweeted that i didn't even know oregano oil was a thing then i remembered normal vitamins which i am bad at taking unless i get anaemic
361 2018-01-20 23:08:12 A few days ago, a white woman posted a picture of her bi-racial daughters hair and she was livid. Her black husband had attempted the daughters hair and kinda just slapped some coconut oil on her head 2 the point Her curl patterns were no longer consistent
362 2018-01-20 23:08:08 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I thought you were draining the swamp? #MAGA right? Sure, our military is getting more funding. Sweet. More money is coming from oil. Cool. But we got to look into more than just those fields! Alternative energy! Education! Put some more funding there!

367 2018-01-20 23:05:53 Macro views do not factor in grade of oil.  It will become more influential in the supply sourcing picture as deliveries firm up.  There is limited cap. for LSC in the global refinery complex.  Shale is LSC, and currently inconsistent.  It does not make US energy ind. @ 20mmboe/d
368 2018-01-20 23:05:39 No he does not. He is a snake oil salesman.

2. GOP gives Russia what it wants - dereg oil/gas.

392 2018-01-20 23:01:25 Oh you mean like "We will be ending the clandestine #Chemtrail program?" That's what I want to hear. As a Dem myself, I am seriously doubting Trump is Pro-Oxygen consd his Pro Oil/ clean Coal & Military(biggest polluters) anti-conservation stance.
393 2018-01-20 23:01:11 Clampets. Oil. Amazing really.

Oh the horror,.  And when it generated megawatts of power without toxic emissions, that must have been tragic.

Oil and coal can not compete with renewables, also they run out. Sad.

420 2018-01-20 22:56:40 Truth indeed rather alleviates than hurts, and will always bear up against falsehood, as oil does above water.

425 2018-01-20 22:55:58 Cavs are leaking serious oil.
426 2018-01-20 22:55:48 Nice! I am optimistic that alternatives (renewables, EVs, efficincy) may provide a demand growrh price cap that is below demand destruction in the general economy. If correct, then global recession is not an unavoidable attendant of peak oil.
427 2018-01-20 22:55:43 The clampets struck oil and still they haven’t won as many trophies since they did! You’ll never be as big as us mate! Just the simple truth! You’re enjoying a day in the sun nothing more! Don’t blame for enjoying it but you’re are still planted in that shadow   Pal!

432 2018-01-20 22:53:35 Our old nasty white guys happen to be mean hearted and bigots. We have, already, no regulations here. The NOLA levee board tried to get the oil companies to pay for the horrendous damage they did. Jindal fired them. Oil and Chem own La.
433 2018-01-20 22:53:31 @ToddDulaney I don’t know what you did or went through, but this new version of “Pulling Me Through” is dripping in OIL!
434 2018-01-20 22:53:11 Chop that shit up. Add olive oil,  rosemary, thyme, salt,  pepper. Shake up to coat. Put in the oven at 350 for 25-30 or until tender. Bone Apple teeth.
435 2018-01-20 22:53:10 is that why your military is strewn all over the globe gathering oil?

445 2018-01-20 22:51:39 When auntie dearest took two eldest sisters to wildhorse. When they got back. Gaw her car was really low on oil.

 Eldest sis: gaw aunt. You tryin to blow out your engine?

Aunt d: the boys don't check it.

Both sis: okay. *uncaps* 

Aunt d: you sure you got the right one?
446 2018-01-20 22:51:16 It's all his fault. Prices will go higher, he is invested in oil. More out of your pocket.

456 2018-01-20 22:49:52 Yes, and oil (I think). The clear lid made them irresistible. My youngest used to be such a picky eater, but no more. When I told him sardines are umami bombs he was like "let's find some crackers to go with them" 
457 2018-01-20 22:49:47 And barrels of oil, units of alcohol, packets of fags, litres of fuel and tonnes of aggregate
458 2018-01-20 22:49:43 So I’m at the place to get my oil changed and this lady comes in making a huge fuss “so you ARE open?!” “No one answered the phone but you ARE open?!” “Why don’t you answer the phone?!” All while the man working here is profusely apologizing saying they would’ve picked up if...
459 2018-01-20 22:49:32 Another possibility is carbon-negative enhanced gas recovery, where enough CO2 is injected to more than offset the carbon content of the gas (or oil) extracted. May be cheaper and more efficient than using excess VRE to create synthetic fuels. Requires a CO2 price, of course.

466 2018-01-20 22:48:09 I smell like fucking burnt oil save me
467 2018-01-20 22:47:25 The United States had its chance in the last 25 years to push ahead with renewable energy. But the oil companies and the politicians depending on the oil stopped at all. And now China has surged ahead providing jobs and much-needed income for their citizens. Could've should've.

469 2018-01-20 22:47:02 Oh god cringing at the flood of memories...so many inappropriate things I did in my youth while this and other similar songs were playing 
470 2018-01-20 22:46:59 Thanks! It’s Vallejo Gunmetal, shaded Nuln Oil, then Typhus Corrosion, drybrushed Ryza Rust, sponged Vallejo Gunmetal and then sponged blood for the blood god. Nurgles Rot in the little holes too
471 2018-01-20 22:46:59 lol just got a discounted oil change for $22 because im pretty i guess
472 2018-01-20 22:46:54 Yea he’s not drippy enough to play against oil with
473 2018-01-20 22:46:47 If you take fish oil & omegas before you smoke will it get you higher? Or would that only apply too edibles? It’s pure healthy fats.
474 2018-01-20 22:46:23 Nope, if anything the increased production in countries like the US, Canada, and Russia drove oil prices to a 10-year low in 2016.
475 2018-01-20 22:46:14 Please stop the madness. Everything that you're saying is bunk. You have just proven time after time that you are completely incapable of telling the truth. Take your snake oil and peddle it in federal prison. We don't want you or need you. Period.

477 2018-01-20 22:45:51 What's your party, that continuously touts (pan-)Kurdish nationalism going to do to help fellow Kurds? Are you finally going to kick Turkish force out of KRI? Are you going to shut the border and stop the exporting oil and importing Turkish goods? Or at least say something?
478 2018-01-20 22:45:44 Coconut oil :)
479 2018-01-20 22:45:43 What do I do with said olive oil? 
480 2018-01-20 22:45:40 Hahaha! When did the oil years begin? Set me straight?
481 2018-01-20 22:45:19 Invested in peppermint oil and spider traps. Hopefully my audio setup now isn't prime real estate for Spiders.

483 2018-01-20 22:44:50 I don’t put off getting oil changes because I’m lazy, I put it off because I hate having awkward conversations with dudes about car parts for extended periods of time.
484 2018-01-20 22:44:47 The oil years  brilliant
485 2018-01-20 22:44:34 Plain vegetable oil works fine; corn, soybean, safflower, etc.

488 2018-01-20 22:44:23 Since it’s cold season our hair tends to get more dry and that’ll cause split ends and dry scalp. So everyday try to oil your scalp with olive oil or castor oil and massage it in. Before you leave the house apply a light oil to ur hair. You’ll see a difference
489 2018-01-20 22:43:57 In the last ten years (the oil years) who’s won more trophies?
490 2018-01-20 22:43:51 Good thing, you'll have scientists doing their science right along side snake oil salesmen and magicians.
491 2018-01-20 22:43:48 The three year old I’m babysitting for just showed me her essential oil defuser and told me I have to put the oils in before she goes to sleep tonight.

494 2018-01-20 22:43:22 A #Guatemalan palm oil supplier called REPSA turned the La Pasión River into the most contaminated river in the world, killing everything in it and impoverishing entire communities. And lo and behold, who's still backing it? Our old friends at #Nestlé, of course.
495 2018-01-20 22:43:15 Oil and water together, how can I be whole? I'm like this hair, all strands and hiding places, yet out in the wide-open too like the moon.
496 2018-01-20 22:43:14 When your previous governments occupied other lands for oil,you ladies just watched and didn’t protests those war crimes.And now you are trying to defend your own rights against a psychopath.Thats what you deserved,Trump is what you deserved.Congratulations!
497 2018-01-20 22:43:11 money?

do you think ultra wealthy oil tycoons are sitting around thinking about the planet and not how they can make more money?

507 2018-01-20 22:41:27 Crude oil prices are perched comfortably above $60, but a top oil watcher warns it won't last #energy #oil
508 2018-01-20 22:41:15 I seriously hate getting off in any store here in West Texas.. like seriously do the oil field or guys in general have to be so disrespectful. My phone case literally has a picture of me and my dude and I hold it to full visibility. FUCK OF
509 2018-01-20 22:41:11 @RachelNotley will take full credit for world oil price rebound as well. It’s all about her and the #NDP making it happen.
510 2018-01-20 22:41:07 スカウトかぁ。なるほど。あと、自国民への教育側面もありそうです。
511 2018-01-20 22:40:55 Do you have any hair oils ? Use them as a hot oil treatment. You can leave that in your hair overnight or for an hour it’s up to you. And the. Use Aleo Vera gel from the leaf (you can get them from Whole Foods) and coat that on your hair with an oil. This can be overnight too
512 2018-01-20 22:40:47 Sounds simple and sensible suggestion @AishaYesufu but the global energy market demands crude oil from us to drive value chains in their countries and not refined products. But we should at least refine what we need locally and explore export market opportunities in Africa.
513 2018-01-20 22:40:36 there's gotta be enough olive oil for the both of us
514 2018-01-20 22:40:20 Oil and cream?

521 2018-01-20 22:39:18 I’m ready to switch to oil paint
522 2018-01-20 22:39:10 Not under water, but under oil and gas.
523 2018-01-20 22:39:05 I recently found out they do have a cleanser option that does not contain coconut oil.
524 2018-01-20 22:38:47 comecei a limpar o rosto (tirar maquiagem e impurezas) com bio oil antes de lavar com sabonete e se um dia eu não acreditei em milagres, hoje eu acredito
525 2018-01-20 22:38:40 Come now. That’s not true at all. You’re being very presumptuous. Limited governments don’t control women’s bodies, they don’t tell states to criminalize marijuana, they don’t make states put up offshore oil rigs. You’ve been conned, you’re not alone. Rise up.
526 2018-01-20 22:38:33 Lol oh don't get me started on that fake deep guy. Such a snake oil salesman with a twist.
527 2018-01-20 22:38:32 Pro oil, not pro life or pro choice
528 2018-01-20 22:38:23 So not sci fi, oil wells.
529 2018-01-20 22:38:18 The majority of Kuwaitis are middle-class. it’s hilarious how westerners and some Arabs think we’re all wealthy and live in mansions over fields of oil lol
530 2018-01-20 22:37:54 We have enough "development" in the NE. 2 dams, over 10 big mines and over 20,000 gas and oil sites. I think we're good.
531 2018-01-20 22:37:48 The only reading your in the Middle East is oil
If they didn’t have a drop, your asses wouldn’t be there
532 2018-01-20 22:37:45 Yes! Dano battered with a mouthful of oil isn't exactly what I think of as hilarious. Be forgiven for thinking it was a comedy from outside.
533 2018-01-20 22:37:42 An oil tanker could pass through the gulf between 'guy is a dick who annoys his neighbors' and 'guy advocates ethnic cleansing.'

One merely violates the social contracts that make modern cities work, and the other is a threat of violence. Hard to draw a parallel.
534 2018-01-20 22:37:40 Destructive, just like all dems and liberal idiots. Praying for you all to understand that all cultures don't mix well just as oil and water.
535 2018-01-20 22:37:37 This deal strengthens both @ManUtd and @Arsenal the clubs who do things like a proper business. Against the oil rich mercenary clubs that are in the league...

546 2018-01-20 22:36:01 And as much as money was a factor (which it was) it’s not like United are some newly successful oil rich club, such as City/Chelsea and to a lesser extent PSG.
547 2018-01-20 22:35:42 We can measure the uselessness of Flood Geology: not a single oil company on earth uses it to find new resources, they use the real geology, proof of the science is in the pump every time you fill up the car or truck

553 2018-01-20 22:34:55 One day I'm going to wake up, and Trump is going to have accidentally shot himself, the beef and corn industries will have toppled, all the coal and oil CEOs will have choked on their collectove lung cancers, and schools will get all their funding for the arts. And happy I'll be.

556 2018-01-20 22:34:33 Finally been given the go ahead to try CBD oil! If this works, it’ll mean no longer having to rely on horrid drowsy pain relief, and I also won’t have to increase my anxiety meds. Fingers crossed!
557 2018-01-20 22:34:02 I’m thinking coconut oil work better on my feet than castor... repairing and strengthening wise.
558 2018-01-20 22:33:53 Oil and water together, how can I be whole? I'm like this hair, all strands and hiding places, yet out in the wide-open too like the moon.
559 2018-01-20 22:33:39 Well,when the Kurds allow the Americans to build bases for themselves this is normal,when the Kurds passed ISIS from Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor and seized oil fields is normal.And when the Russians just leave the town and the Turks begin to panettiruling brave Kurds, it is bad Russian
560 2018-01-20 22:33:36 Oil isn't simply a commodity as carbon pricing spreads, especially in Asia. In that case, low carbon-intensity becomes a competitive issue. Read Suncor, Cenovus CSR reports, they get it and already preparing for the future.
561 2018-01-20 22:33:22 "Let the just man strike me; that is kindness; let him reprove me; it is oil for the head, Which my head shall not refuse, but I will still pray under these afflictions." Ps 140 #Vespers

Socialism is horrible.
567 2018-01-20 22:32:06 My no car situation is just for today- had to get the oil changed!  BUT it’s been good for me. Haha
568 2018-01-20 22:32:06 "The industry has to begin to sunset." What a silly argument. Do you expect it to fall on its sword? Or is it more likely that oil will be replaced by EVs in due time? Until that time, oil consumption is growing from 98.6MM b/d today to 115MM b/d in 2040.

594 2018-01-20 22:28:09 The Canadian Nuclear Association had suggested years ago using a nuke to generate steam for oil sands extraction. While I doubt this was ever pressing, it might be an interesting study.
595 2018-01-20 22:28:07 Even among snake oil salesmen eyebrows are raised when they encounter a renewable energy promoter. This speaks volumes. 
596 2018-01-20 22:28:05 I'm talking oil for med purposes.  Affordable is accessible.  Rec imports will come eventually.
597 2018-01-20 22:28:02 いかん、ちょっとさずにお疲れてる
598 2018-01-20 22:28:00 It's because of oil then  Gaddafi was refusing to trade with USA and you know how hostile the States are towards countries that have oil. I'm sure they have looted
599 2018-01-20 22:27:59 gas and oil industry to pollute and drill whenever and wherever they want. He may have said it was VA reform but no money has gone there and nothing has changed. That wasn't tax reform, it's a temporary tax cut for citizens. Yep and they had to cheat to pass it.

604 2018-01-20 22:27:33 Just watched #Dunkirk 
Needless to say lived up to the hype and acclaim.
Haven't seen such an intense scene on the silver screen like the oil spill one in a long long time. 
Only my opinion but Nolan and Zimmer are the worthy successors to the greats Spielberg and Williams.
605 2018-01-20 22:27:30 After three quarters, Sikeston leads Whitfield 55-54. Torrence Watson with 32 points for Whitfield, needs 8 more to set the single-game record for the MFA Oil Shootout.

612 2018-01-20 22:25:24 The road is sweating FFS! Asphalt doesn't stick to water. It is oil based. LIKE WE ALL KNOW!
613 2018-01-20 22:25:23 I really just washed my own car, conditioned the inside, and changed my oil. Girl Power shiiiiiiiii

617 2018-01-20 22:24:51 So the special oil they use is just blessed Olive oil. Huh
618 2018-01-20 22:24:47 if you soaked arnica flowers in oil and then used that as bruise/general closed wound ointment, it wouldn't be toxic unless you drank it, right?

623 2018-01-20 22:23:54 @OfficialPDPNig  came into power in 1999 at a time where Nigeria was left behind in everything. From banking, telecommunications to aviation, oil and gas to infrastructure. No one dares to leave money in a bank then. Communication was no existence.
624 2018-01-20 22:23:30 Ed Woodward completely outplayed the whole of Arabia and its oil money by getting a straight swap deal for Sanchez.

631 2018-01-20 22:22:44 There Will Be Blood was based on the early dairymen but they changed it to oil to avoid "hurt feelings". Why would an oilman say, "I drink YOUR milkshake"?
632 2018-01-20 22:22:43 Crude oil is at its highest level in more than three years, but one market watcher expects it to be short-lived.
633 2018-01-20 22:22:03 Two ship crash, so many dead and such a HUGE oil spill -

Maby the ships shouldnt be so HUGE so When it goes to hell

635 2018-01-20 22:21:58 Estimates suggest the UK Treasury will pay £4.8bn in rebates between 2015-2021 to Gas & Oil companies & have cost taxpayers £396m in 2016. Oil & Gas companies now want 60bn plus for decommissioning platforms. These industries are taking the piss out of UK Taxpayers.
636 2018-01-20 22:21:52 Lol me I kuku know. I was just looking at her mouth as she was saying it.gone back to coconut oil alone and already I see a difference
637 2018-01-20 22:21:44 Key IMO is once China can print CNY for oil, they don't need 26% of GDP in FX reserves; US only has 0.6% bc it can print USD for imports.  I think "dumping USD" is possible, but IMO unlikely & unnecessary - all global CB's must do is "grow FX rsvs slower than US deficits"...

645 2018-01-20 22:20:01 @StarNewsOnline everyone doesn't want offshore drilling not surprising. What's suprising is these people can't figure out USA buys foreign oil from OPEC & we sell our oil to overseas still. Why else is our gas prices are high? Guess this fools want hi gas $
646 2018-01-20 22:19:56 Also I use baby oil in the shower to make mine feel smoother and soft
647 2018-01-20 22:19:54 Other green kale idea for the next time I feel like experimenting - toasted pine nuts and roasted butternut squash cubes, balsamic. Also thinking of an asian style thing with toasted sesame oil which I think would work well but needs something else.
648 2018-01-20 22:19:53 Alberta oil sands producers are busy lowering the carbon-intensity of their crude by 30-35%. To the extent that crude displaces more carbon-intense crudes (Nigeria, Venezuela, etc), it's a net reduction of GHG emissions. So, not impossible, thermodynamically or otherwise

661 2018-01-20 22:18:18 45, his family, his Party are basically saying, “we control everything even SCOTUS. We’re passive aggressively nasty, we’ll give away the US store. Again! Come and get us, hack us, try and stop us. What’s the price of oil? $65? How about $100+. Watch us.”

665 2018-01-20 22:17:59 Feel your pain - made that mistake with oil once. All that can be done in such circumstances is to drink more wine!
666 2018-01-20 22:17:55 5/people making the argument that the NDP aren't doing a good job fail to take into acct that the province isn't in an oil boom. if the CON govts of previous years had done anything well they would have ensured AB reliance on oil prices was over.

669 2018-01-20 22:17:45 The oil they said would run out in 10 years back in 1979 and every 5 years since? Scotlands wealth being robbed by Westminster aided and abetted by Scottish Tories
670 2018-01-20 22:17:44 Is it all because of oil?

692 2018-01-20 22:14:36 4/ if they had done so, even more oil companies would have shutdown more operations. so in the end its because of the price of oil and the NDP are trying to change the economy so that it isnt so dependent on oil. which the CON govt had 40 yrs to do and didnt.

721 2018-01-20 22:09:52 1/everything he states is true but what the article fails to state is that during those kelin years, the province was in a boom and wasn't transitioning away from an oil dominant economy in which the oil companies began to transition their own portfolio away from a heavy reliance
722 2018-01-20 22:09:43 1. I haven’t, I don’t think we have those although I have seen a lot of commercials on tv. 
2. I feel both ways on seasoning. Like seasoning is cool. But fried in peanut oil and has just salt is cool too, great for dipping in honey or ice cream. So jury’s out on that one.

727 2018-01-20 22:08:23 More importantly, feels delicious. I have a stomach disorder (please no sympathy) and bacon grease feels good on the tummy. Not sure why b cause fried foods fuck with me. Perhaps it’s the chemical make up of deep fried oil and pan fried, maybe.
728 2018-01-20 22:08:10 Capitalism is similar to Communism - people who actually use and depend on property have no control over it and are even forced to labor far more than they need to, to the benefit of the collectivist heroes. IE Oil companies need for oil rigs on your property.

735 2018-01-20 22:06:52 Ask them what plan they have for India...it’s street war...if we innovate...they will eat our resources like Mughals ,Muslim Kashmiri’s Rohingya Bangladesh and breed..they live on natural resources ex oil in Saudi Arabia..ex eat cows..they don’t work hard..or earn honestly..

743 2018-01-20 22:05:02 Buffett is making $100’s of millions keeping Canada’s oil flowing by his rail cars rather than a pipeline. Sad that one single person can negatively impact so many.
744 2018-01-20 22:04:35 side note: that photo would make a great starting point for oil on canvas.

748 2018-01-20 22:03:23 An adulting update: My insurance doesn't start until next month, I have what feels to be two cavities in my teeth. I ate a cookie and the sweetness made my mouth hurt so bad for at least 5 minutes. So I'm going to try oil pulling when I get home tonight, hopefully it helps.
749 2018-01-20 22:03:20 This is gloss varnish! I’ve never used resin because I love gamblins varnish. But if your painting is anything other than oil I wouldn’t recommend it.

753 2018-01-20 22:03:04 I do not have sympathy for people who by all measures, should know better, on matters of morality and ethics.
It is not hard to figure out that starting yet another war, is a bad thing, when the "threat" is oil  you weren't getting anyway.
754 2018-01-20 22:02:57 I've not tried it but apparently you can put the shredded leaves in olive oil in an ice cube tray and freeze it, so you end up with basil-infused cooking oil in handy portions.
755 2018-01-20 22:02:45 Finally filled my gas tank, changed my oil, pumped up my tires, and fixed my back left turn signal. The Dank Tank is back to good health

759 2018-01-20 22:02:01 Oil of oregano and honey and zinc are more preventative. And for the honey, raw is best cause it has good bacteria. I take oil of oregano at the first sign of a cold and it will either stop it completely or make it a lot weaker.
760 2018-01-20 22:01:54 yeooo three man? oil changes cmon man
761 2018-01-20 22:01:46 Apply cold water and coconut oil
762 2018-01-20 22:01:40 Well now I go to coffee tastings, espresso tastings, olive oil tastings, and or ride a bunch so that I can go to some sort of food tastings. Now I need to find some chocolate tastings, hmmm that sounds delicious yummy yummy.
763 2018-01-20 22:01:30 Very true. Only with continual introspection and improvement can you prevent this happening. Left neglected, the road of change becomes slick with the oil of bureaucracy and too expensive to travel on.
764 2018-01-20 22:01:25 Ok so most of the time that happens to me. I set i do everything and still it comes off like its oil. I hate makeup sometimes.
765 2018-01-20 22:01:23 Here at Mizzou Arena for MFA Oil / Break Time Shootout. Mizzou signee @TorrenceWatson has already put together strong performance against No. 2 Class 4 Sikeston (and SLU signee Fred Thatch). 

Watson scored 21 points in the first half.
766 2018-01-20 22:01:19 Right?! Just do what the damn car tells you to do, routine oil changes are the bare minimum LOL how do people not do it
767 2018-01-20 22:01:17 i bought an essential oil that's called money... if i don't become a mf millionaire im suing. (:
768 2018-01-20 22:01:08 Why does he look like he was submerged in a pool of olive oil
769 2018-01-20 22:00:58 And the mic, and the insurance lobby, big pharma, and the damn oil companies....
770 2018-01-20 22:00:46 Yep. Scotland keeps all taxes generated within its borders including corporate, VAT, and oil and gas taxes, and they'll go for it.
771 2018-01-20 22:00:37 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this January? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.
772 2018-01-20 22:00:34 I’ve got tips re: this too. (I wish I had tips about cool stuff.) Oil of oregano drops (mix about 5-6 in a small amount of water and do it as a shot). Zinc. Hot water with honey/lemon/ginger. Eat to fuel your body’s fight. Sleep.

779 2018-01-20 21:59:24 I really hope I win I had to down load Twitter and follow you to get it
780 2018-01-20 21:59:23 My weird ass don’t care for avocados but love cooking with avocado oil smh
781 2018-01-20 21:59:14 Facts being you shill your BS all over  twitter. You charge people for "predictions". That's just as dangerous as investing in a ponzi. I really hope you don't lead people wrong this community doesn't need snake oil if we want a future.
782 2018-01-20 21:58:55 You know, at least Democrats of the past had the courage to attack the rich openly. Like Huey P. Long, and his "Share the  Wealth" motto. He at least had Standard Oil & J. P. Morgan in his sights when THEY had F.D.R. in their pocket.
783 2018-01-20 21:58:31 I'm invited to my first threesome. Am I supposed to bring three-in-one oil or something? Does the host provide lubricant? What's the etiquette?

785 2018-01-20 21:58:21 Olive Oil is typing a deposition about how many times she was sexually harassed by Brutus!
786 2018-01-20 21:58:13 Not really. Because Cait's article is based on actual observable actions taken by Trump. Those of us who aren't blind can see he's doing everything the Republican establishment he claimed to be against has demanded. He's no maverick. Just another snake oil salesman, like Obama
787 2018-01-20 21:58:10 The crazy @realDonaldTrump should pay attention to the impoverishment of Americans instead of coveting the mineral and oil wealth of other peoples @bennykoval @ambiedextrous @JihadiColin @not3bad.

791 2018-01-20 21:57:42 Stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia and supporting the mistreatment of women.  Start supporting good ole Canadian Albertans.  We need jobs...we have oil!
792 2018-01-20 21:57:33 Drinking motor oil puts hair on your chest 
793 2018-01-20 21:57:13 Oil all over the ground and the machine bone dry and locked up!
794 2018-01-20 21:57:10 They were good. I was glad I did them in the UUNI as alot of the oil/fat came out. Cooking them directly in the tomato sauce would not have been food.
795 2018-01-20 21:56:54 Aloe vera breaks me out
Coconut oil breaks me out
796 2018-01-20 21:56:34 I ain’t playing that you ain’t shit enough to carry oil against

799 2018-01-20 21:56:03 You can't have long lasting housing when you mix seniors and college housing.. like missing oil and water
800 2018-01-20 21:55:52 My dad said he’s retired from changing my oil for me... guess I officially need a man hooked on the cat enough to do it.
801 2018-01-20 21:55:52 bro just try some fish oil taste horrible but can be effective
802 2018-01-20 21:55:52 I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I literally went back and forth debating with myself whether or not I was going to put oil on my ankles. 
803 2018-01-20 21:55:50 Oil
804 2018-01-20 21:55:47 My last oil painting was created probably 6-8 years ago. 

Long overdue.
805 2018-01-20 21:55:43 Let me get this oil change
806 2018-01-20 21:55:30 The oil was nationalized over 20 years before Chavez even became President. Leftists cheer and celebrate nationalization, socialists do not, because it just means a political elite exploiting the workers instead of private bosses.

808 2018-01-20 21:55:24 Cameroon is Africa's third largest producer of palm oil.
809 2018-01-20 21:55:22 ugh boooooo
she is refusing to cancel. And won’t post in  a 3kg satchel - she wants $20. 3x plastic bottles of oil at 470ml each. (was $10 postage each).
810 2018-01-20 21:55:04 Agree, though we used olive oil instead. Any oil that is thick enough to coat the scalp/hair and lice should work. Not saying it's easy, though.
811 2018-01-20 21:54:57 RT @threeletterman3: Moon looks like he do a oil change in 3 min

813 2018-01-20 21:54:55 Keep spouting ignorance as glaciers recede and Russians take full advantage of thinning arctic ice for oil field exploitation.
814 2018-01-20 21:54:52 Citrus oil is a natural insecticide. :> My ivy's got a spider mite problem so I'm blitzing the lot in the hopes of getting rid of the little bastards.
815 2018-01-20 21:54:51 Thanks @dominos I’m converted (from the other place) the chilli oil and rocket with the Verona   
816 2018-01-20 21:54:35 Painting around my home has really inspired me to pull out these canvases and start working on some oil & acrylic pieces.
817 2018-01-20 21:54:27 I do need an oil change however I live a few hundred miles away.
818 2018-01-20 21:54:24 Zinke... this is a good time to start the oil drilling off all the coastline but Florida of course...  or to cut some more monuments back... or to sell some mineral rights in the middle of a National Park... you could get away with it as there will be fewer people there! Luv NRDC
819 2018-01-20 21:54:18 Load-in and set-build day tomorrow means it is time for my semi-annual visit to The Box of Potentially Useful Things ™. Old car jack? No. Broken dryer vent? No. Approximately 18 hex keys? Half a liter of engine oil from two cars ago? No. WD-40…maybe?
820 2018-01-20 21:53:43 Moon looks like he do a oil change in 3 min
821 2018-01-20 21:53:14 Was gonna make some grilled chicken and bean burritos today, but we are out of vegetable oil and I don't feel like going to the store. So I think I might just make some mac'n'cheese and chicken nuggets.

I'll grab some oil on my way home tomorrow for burritos.

823 2018-01-20 21:52:43 Bruised and slightly cut my palm at the gun range. Need to clean and oil my gun especially with the cold weather to avoid doing that again.
824 2018-01-20 21:52:25 I have skin sensitivity issues too. Have you tried ivory soap? It’s very gentle. You might need a light moisturizer after. Oil of Olay for sensitive skin is pretty gentle as well. You can put on a few drops while face is still wet to prevent it from causing oiliness.
825 2018-01-20 21:52:16 Because we need new ways to inject sugar and soybean oil into our body?
826 2018-01-20 21:52:12 Bless his heart.

834 2018-01-20 21:51:05 We shouldn’t individualise this. The fault lies with the NPCC and College of Bystanders both of which have spent far too long theorising; far too little engaging with the realities of the frontline and meanwhile sucking up think-tank snake oil

856 2018-01-20 21:46:42 With all his bankruptcies and lawsuits against him, Trump clearly has no good "business acumen." He is little more than a snake oil salesman who finds a sucker a minute.
857 2018-01-20 21:46:40 I stopped taking tramadol and am only using cannabis for pain. I am having difficulty finding the right balance. I don't want to be high. I want to be functional. I have doubled my cbd oil. If this doesn't work, I will have to go back on tramadol.
858 2018-01-20 21:46:39 Shale oil presumably plays a big part in this story...
859 2018-01-20 21:46:13 1. Oil laid off because GW and Obama pushed for more supply and generated more leases. The result was russia expanding the caspian and the US led in supply, and they both did a 3 year stand off with OPEC for market share. It is why market was flat 14-16, and why u got cheap gas
860 2018-01-20 21:45:56 It’s not a special inlet. It’s a service access door (for oil, starter valve, or something else - I can’t remember). 

The hose is just wedged in there. Every engine has some sort of access where you can blow warm air.
861 2018-01-20 21:45:43 You do not get to decide what someone else does with their body. You were not the one who was pregnant. It's not about you. It was never about you. #prochoice
862 2018-01-20 21:45:30 Good to know. Will continue to buy it.

863 2018-01-20 21:45:05 Yup. He unnecessarily ruined vacations that some saved all year for to make everyday Americans feel miserable without government. In reality, a government shutdown should be unnoticeable to most, and illustrative of how unnecessary big government really is.

875 2018-01-20 21:42:42 Try putting Castro oil, coconut oil, or Vaseline at night/when you don't have makeup on. I also take my makeup off with coconut oil and unscented baby wipes. Don't use waterproof mascara unless you have too because it's really harsh on your eyelashes.
876 2018-01-20 21:42:33 @OfficialPDPNig  came into power in 1999 at a time where Nigeria was left behind in everything. From banking, telecommunications to aviation, oil and gas to infrastructure. No one dares to leave money in a bank then. Communication was no existence.

881 2018-01-20 21:42:05 Does having a nightmare I was crushed to death by a giant oil painting of my face betray my narcissism or my self loathing?
882 2018-01-20 21:41:50 I have to hope he’s joking...it just so embarrassing
883 2018-01-20 21:41:47 I thought of you yesterday - tried a new dressing made of avocado and it was delish!  Mash 1 avocado, juice of 1 Clementine, smash 1 clove of garlic into paste, 3 TBSP olive oil and as much finely diced jalapeño as you like.  Served on a raw kale salad w/roasted pepitos.  Yum!
884 2018-01-20 21:41:46 I got a massage on board this cruise ship the other day. Afterward she tried to sell me cellulite removing oil. Said it would be very helpful for skin like mine. Way to shame a body that’s just trying to relax.
885 2018-01-20 21:41:40 Cook rice (in coconut milk if you have it). Add spices to rice when cooking. (Curry ginger turmeric pepper.)  Cook lentils. I cook with rice in crockpot).  Saute garlic onion & vegetables of choice in oil.  Mix rice lentils and vegetables together.  Tada.

887 2018-01-20 21:41:28 Great article is this inferrring that oil could be overbought ATM and a correction to the downside is likely?
888 2018-01-20 21:41:16 I’m a chemical engineer working in oil refining. Not sure what your point is.  #womensmarch2018
889 2018-01-20 21:41:07 I throw chunks of butternut squash (or any veg really) in the oven with some oil and mix it with microwave packs of quinoa or bulgar wheat or any carb disguised as goodness. Chuck some rocket and pine nuts in it  v minimal effort.
890 2018-01-20 21:40:59 See how you came to pour oil in my garri

918 2018-01-20 21:37:44 The problem is world leaders...otherewise known as humans....with oil ...diamond's...gold...etc..rich resources.....but yet

925 2018-01-20 21:36:18 Don't understand why oil FC waited for tha last hour to bid for him in August
926 2018-01-20 21:36:12 Tried to schedule an oil change online but never got a confirmation email. Can't even get a date with the oil change place.

I've mostly slept all day, but also drank lots of tea, took vitamin c, zinc, vitamin d +k, tylenol, mucinex d, and alternated between heating pad for sore things and freezer pack for eyes/forehead. Also eucalyptus oil in diffuser. Allll the things.
936 2018-01-20 21:33:47 Oil diffusers are better than any scented plugin or candle
937 2018-01-20 21:33:47 How is it for palm oil?
938 2018-01-20 21:33:37 We beat those Oil money merchants to the signing of Alexis Sanchez, and we didn't even had to pay a dime 
939 2018-01-20 21:33:31 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

945 2018-01-20 21:32:50 Well, I've looked that up and can't see anything mentioning oil in £s
946 2018-01-20 21:32:41 self help is bullshit and the stuff in turn your pain into art is worthless, inane, selfish, dellusional snake oil.
947 2018-01-20 21:32:39 Really ? The media hype about the damage the oil would do was the disaster sir
948 2018-01-20 21:32:22 Or how about oil rich middle eastern nations pitch in and help their own people out?
949 2018-01-20 21:32:21 I hate bringing my car in for oil changes... I don’t need the people who change my car juice to be judging my soundtrack cassettes and collection of Reese’s cups wrappers

@JeffFlake still stand by your ridiculous words?
952 2018-01-20 21:31:21 This is why the Oil will never succeed. Can’t stop living in the past. Makes you wonder if Lowe still pulls the strings.
953 2018-01-20 21:31:20 Very good question. I would say “yes” if it is cleaned properly. The pan should be hand washed (scoured) with soap and warm water. Run through a dish machine. Air dried, coated with allergen safe oil and seasoned w salt. Still in any allergen situation, be cautious.
954 2018-01-20 21:31:19 Can you do the large Doc Johnson(black one on the right). Coconut oil works well
955 2018-01-20 21:31:19 Yet somehow, with less oil, the Norwegians get £8 BILLION.  Maybe they are run by Alex Salmond?
956 2018-01-20 21:31:08 Together, we can save American lives, American jobs, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

980 2018-01-20 21:28:04 I have used coconut oil on my hair and skin since I was small and it’s always been great! Start with a little and see how you respond

1029 2018-01-20 21:20:21 @Ford you guys really need to examine your training material for your technicians. At two different Ford dealerships over the past year, we've driven our car home after an oil change and found the engine covered in oil because the cap was left off. It's absurd.
1030 2018-01-20 21:20:20 Sounds criminal.
1031 2018-01-20 21:20:00 Is using coconut oil (straight from the jar) a good idea for face skin care?
1032 2018-01-20 21:19:53 Would like they the oil, too?
1033 2018-01-20 21:19:46 There's a couple I would let go of.. But patty, Kass.. Absolutely not
1034 2018-01-20 21:19:40 Encouragement of fossil fuels, which India is scarce in, is detrimental to our economy (many ways including CAD & Forex), security (petro dollars fund terror), foreign policy (w/ Gulf) & environment (obvious)..Hawkish Oil Pricing has also given buffer for infra & societal spends
1035 2018-01-20 21:19:37 @LukeGromen Still processing your recent interview on Real Vision- if yuan backed oil contract trades in volume and countries start to sell them oil denominated in yuan, the results on DXY and US treasuries are potentially staggering.  Care to elaborate of timing and US $?  Thx.
1036 2018-01-20 21:19:31 I needed some orange peel to make citrus oil spray for my plants, so I got some oranges from work and holy crap I forgot how delicious they are. :>
1037 2018-01-20 21:19:18 U know winter is never coming in Nigeria, so there is no need for night watchers to man the wall. You are talking of  plan???. As we are all typing they are spending money looking for same oil up north.
1038 2018-01-20 21:19:16 Kurds are numb. They could have had some sort of autonomous rojava and a deal with Assad for the oil. What do they think they can achieve by pissing everyone of to please the US?

1040 2018-01-20 21:18:55 Good news! Concentrated cannabis oil and the Holy anointing oil (yes, the one used by Lord Jesus)  can stop addiction to these horrible opioids immediately. I saw it happen.
1041 2018-01-20 21:18:46 Why make a smoothie at all? More than likely as a meal replacement right? And I’m not finna eat a tablespoon of oil. Weed infused or not. It’s just a method of ingestion. But there’s plenty body building blogs on it too

1049 2018-01-20 21:18:20 @jiffylube so i noticed my car is dripping oil from the drain plug.. never had this issue. Spoke with the techs at the location and they blame the drain plug so that means they messed up the drain plu or the oil pan..
1050 2018-01-20 21:18:17 Yeah. No oil in Afrin. Why would russia protect treacherous kurds.
1051 2018-01-20 21:18:11 @tvcnewsng @EstherTVCnews If oil is found in Sokoto,Kebbi and Anambra, the problem is "the management of the oil"
1052 2018-01-20 21:18:08 Coconut oil is wonderful but tbh if you have frizzy/very curly hair your should probably opt for a diff oil cuz coconut oil in the long run will make it more frizzy & stiff
1053 2018-01-20 21:17:37 Just use just a little under your eyes. I don't use an under eye primer just a face one. Nyx primer oil most times. And Milani strobe primer

1058 2018-01-20 21:15:48 Well coconut oil is supposedly a good fat (when I was researching I found conflicting reports but it’s been years & I believe it’s a good thing in moderation) so when cutting out “bad” fats it’s a good replacement. Plus coconut oil is great in general 
1059 2018-01-20 21:15:47 1. I love The Sciences & understand it well.When I take a Course in Chemistry I want to learn about Chemistry, not Politics or Theology. Theology is a Subjective Subject, Chemistry is an Objective subject- you cannot mix oil with water. They separate themselves.

1075 2018-01-20 21:13:32 I said the other day that I’ve never tried a foundation stick. That’s not true. Elf used to have one (they discontinued it) and I literally had to use jojoba oil to prime

1087 2018-01-20 21:12:49 Not yet :( Kiehl’s has an oil I’m sampling but I think it’s more for grooming and not so much thickening the patchy parts
1088 2018-01-20 21:12:49 Eh, natural oil is better than baby oil. Either coconut or olive
1089 2018-01-20 21:12:20 Why I just have a nigga try to flirt with me while he’s changing my oil. 1. I have a man, and a whole ring on my finger 2. I look homeless 3. I came for new oil, not a new nigga thank you

1096 2018-01-20 21:10:20 Dinner: fry chorizo, leftover chicken and onion until the oil begins to render. Add large bunch green kale, soy and saute till the kale is done. Top tip: keep a handful of kale back and stir in at the last moment for extra texture. #food #dinner

1108 2018-01-20 21:09:18 Texas produces oil and cattle, we are good on beef production, and fossil fuels are so last century...our Department Of Energy Lab figured that out.

1110 2018-01-20 21:08:43 It's good as fuck lol
1111 2018-01-20 21:08:27 Oil of oregano....   rub it in the bottom of her feet.   (The part we walk on).   Very little because it is strong.    Adults can take it orally but it’s better or it to be applied topically to children.     Found at Kardish usually....Rexall or shoppers. Good luck

1130 2018-01-20 21:03:42 brother finally came and changed my oil 
1131 2018-01-20 21:03:41 Oil exists in its natural form. It doesn't need to be made but it does need to be drilled for and then processed into petrol, diesel etc. But both basically dirty fuels that need significant energy expended and emissions created to produce.

1164 2018-01-20 20:59:18 Yeah it draws out toxins so it pulls the dirt/oil to the surface. You have to use it a few times before it helps your skin.
1165 2018-01-20 20:59:16 It's a fair argument. Oil refinery isn't much better though, and crude oil is still way more limited than the earth's hydrogen supply.

1171 2018-01-20 20:58:17 Sriracha and chili oil!
1172 2018-01-20 20:58:11 Soften onion in olive oil, add garlic & smoked paprika then white wine, peppers & tomato.  Cook until thickened & finish with hake, prawns & spinach. 
Made it up as I went along so no precise measurements,
1173 2018-01-20 20:58:01 I discovered a whole ass mall while waiting for my oil change...this is dangerous
1174 2018-01-20 20:57:59 living in AZ it's like having all the moisture sucked right out of your skin 24/7 year round .. I use an argan oil and salt scrup and then NatureWell Retinol available at Sam's Club . and do the lotion 10 times a day just to stay even!  Can't wait to move to Hawaii with humidity!
1175 2018-01-20 20:57:53 SO LAST NIGHT HULK INADVERTENTLY CREATED THE BEST SANDWICH EVER: PULLED CHICKEN LIGHTLY DRESSED IN RICE VINEGAR, OLIVE OIL, BUTTER, SALT,

1177 2018-01-20 20:57:37 Got to re-up on almond oil, and got a new La Roche Posay face lotion for $10. 
1178 2018-01-20 20:57:35 I miss oil painting and charcoal drawing.  Two of my favorite activities in the world.  Life drawing and figure painting are just fascinating!!! Glad you also do this!!! I involve myself for hours in it!!
1179 2018-01-20 20:57:32 Does anyone actually like Rachel Ray? I mean almost every “30 minute meals” episode was sandwiches. And she abreviated extra virgin olive oil to EVOO.

1182 2018-01-20 20:57:22 I have a friend who was managing her pain with canabis oil quite well until her pain increased significantly. She then went into hospital for monitored use of dilaudid until her pain could be managed again with oil. She was just released 2 days ago. Oil isn't always enough.
1183 2018-01-20 20:57:03 Is that you telling more lies, Ross? We all know the oil is worthless & running out because that's what your friends told us in 2014.
So what is it Ross worthless & running out OR are just another Tory doing as Westminster tells you???

The @WHO have stated patient access should be allowed immediately.

And to the relevant "professionals" (@GregHuntMP @amapresident @StevenJMiles), "medical #Cannabis" is also higher quality raw plant, not just an oil extract in a pill!

1190 2018-01-20 20:55:41 If you have to remove harsh mop-cleaner residue from an ebony finished wood floor, forget about using vinegar or oil soap. What works is Windex (or diluted ammonia, I guess). And serious elbow grease. Be sure to dry each patch with a microfiber towel as you go. Such a relief.

1197 2018-01-20 20:55:02 Modi Govt's obsession with tax is a different debate in which we will have many points of congruence but let's agree to disagree on Oil Pricing..I am a longtime advocate of Zero personal Income Tax & a practical Consumption Tax that broadens the tax net..
1198 2018-01-20 20:54:27 They're important as oil for economies to function,

But as the be all and end all? well

then we're up the junction!

So a balanced argument is what I want to see,

Rather than a one sided soundbite delivered with glee.
1199 2018-01-20 20:54:24 Maybe not - the £1,437 PER HEAD in extra funding to Scotland would be an early casualty.  You’d already have the £8BN oil revenues black hole.  So careful what you wish for.

1287 2018-01-20 20:41:27 Hey I am sure there is some oil involved but I am sure it’s more to do with strategic position of the Middle East and the anti communism stand most of the world used to have. I can’t say that is really a problem anymore Based on US support for China
1288 2018-01-20 20:41:13 Then why do the houston liberal elite care so much about banning homeless people from erecting shelter? Why don't they go after the oil industry that poisons millions of moms and kids daily? Oh, that's right, keeping the cities image clean for oil money in their pockets...

1307 2018-01-20 20:38:11 Ser #507000452, MS180C BE.  Accurate Lawn & Garden.  Winnipeg.  Oil not flowing to chain.  Dealer says abuse, saw too hot.  I say no-way, just following starting instructions.
1308 2018-01-20 20:38:07 Logan took my car to get an oil change yesterday and left 40$ in it so i could fill it up and wash it.  all bc he just wants to “spoil me” im so lucky. 
1309 2018-01-20 20:38:03 read a listicle of fun, free things to do and two points were "change your oil" and "start writing your will"
1310 2018-01-20 20:37:58 It's easy enough to get things palm oil free. The fact is, when the actual diets of actual vegans are studied, the land use, water stress, and CO2 emissions are significantly lower compared to standard animal- inclusive eaters. Sources when i'm home! Cheers
1311 2018-01-20 20:37:55 Then problem is not Oil Pricing..The problem is why jobs are shrinking if they are (I don't disagree w/ u on this..despite all jobs & mudra data at least anecdotal evidence portrays a gloomy picture but mind you it's anecdotal not scientific) & why incomes are not growing in jobs
1312 2018-01-20 20:37:52 Literally two fingertips throughout my beard. I don’t think my skin takes well to oil though. Even when I had locs, the oil from my hair (that’d touch my face) would cause breakouts.
1313 2018-01-20 20:37:40 I'm going to be trying oil anything to possibly help
1314 2018-01-20 20:37:34 Need to get an oil change.
1315 2018-01-20 20:37:31 I need an oil change like yesterday
1316 2018-01-20 20:37:30 Can you not read.  Were Labour run schools so bad you can't tell the difference between "B" and "M"?  And you think SNP are bad?!

The UK take ~30 MILLION in revenue (that Scotland are given credit for).  Norway take ~£8 BILLION.  And they have less oil.
1317 2018-01-20 20:37:18 Btw Jan & Dec 2017,Buhari paid over N300bn subsidy to select oil marketers without NASS approval- Reps

The EFCC pretended to be deaf & dumb on the matter. Maybe they are waiting for directive from the petroleum minister who also doubles as the key suspect in the subsidy scam
1318 2018-01-20 20:37:16 Try rosehip oil!! So moisturizing and natural!
1319 2018-01-20 20:37:05 Sit , what does an oil spill have to do with climate change?smh
1320 2018-01-20 20:36:51 I still have cbd oil here for Patricia Campo and Cathy Ables Jones
1321 2018-01-20 20:36:47 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
1322 2018-01-20 20:36:41 that is what i am hearing,sure YPG used the opportunity for their own expansion,but US is interested in the eastern region for its oil and doesn't want Assad controlling them,it is YPG not US that is playing the game with Turkey
1323 2018-01-20 20:36:25 Thanks for responding; i'll get back to you with sources when i'm off vacation (sunning in Maui). The issues you raise with palm oil are legitimate; they are discussed within vegan circles, and solutions explored. But this is not an issue unique to plant-based food products.
1324 2018-01-20 20:36:14 do you know how much ed has generated for United? The sponsorship deals? We using our own resources, not Qatar or oil money

1326 2018-01-20 20:36:02 Canada Gay friendly Oilsands & Natural Gay at tidewater displaces dictator oil & gas from regimes that throw our  off buildings.
1327 2018-01-20 20:35:52 Well, not exactly worthless, but just like oil in the ground, it is worth a whole lot more once extracted and distilled.
1328 2018-01-20 20:35:32 Great visual, though I'm not a fan of keeping an ongoing tally of carbs (or calories). I would add olive oil to the veggie plate along with nuts, sauerkraut, chicken sausage, and pomegranate. That would be more realistic — and sustainable. I wouldn't eat the left plate by itself.
1329 2018-01-20 20:35:14 I know let’s just hand the government to big oil, Goldman Sachs, big pharma, and private education. They will all work in our best interest. Hell what can go wrong.
1330 2018-01-20 20:35:04 Apart from the oil tanker than looks like my exact collection as a child

1332 2018-01-20 20:34:55 and that's how it starts - the first domino thinks it was all about oil, but at the end of the ripple effect you have any number of cockamamie theories from dustification to mini nukes and cruise missiles

This is the problem with you stupid leftists. You have no clue how economies work.
1335 2018-01-20 20:34:44 tea tree oil really works wonders 
1336 2018-01-20 20:34:31 Tried out pasta substitute "NuPasta". Made it with olive oil, garlic, basil, and red pepper flakes, which is the way I usually make pasta. The NuPasta smelled weird and tasted weird. Not great. I intend to give it another chance with a tomato-based sauce.
1337 2018-01-20 20:34:29 Could be I blew a radiator hose, a temperature gauge malfunction, might need antifreeze, an oil leak. Perks of driving an old car. Could be a whole host of problems.

1346 2018-01-20 20:33:27 All I could tell her was to tame my edges I use Ebin.... I really don’t know what else to say... coconut oil? I know that’s popular I don’t use it... but yeah.
1347 2018-01-20 20:33:20 Folded over (the oil helps make a nice pocket) and rolled out again and then split into balls to flatten again into discs. Then put in 450 degree oven on preheated baking sheet to get a good pocket. Alternative is just throw them in a hot pan which don't get pocket but are good
1348 2018-01-20 20:33:17 This was my argument when @atiku was accused of monopolising oil/maritime sector. They all needed to be broken down for effective competition.

1350 2018-01-20 20:32:56 The oil baron owners would not pay the 15m agent fees. Utd and there self generated millions would. The story about him city is exgerated. Utd have been after for ages I have been told. You know I have a source !
1351 2018-01-20 20:32:52 Could they do better? Yes. But still we could have much worse owners. It has nothing to do w them being American. It has to do w them not having loads of oil money.
1352 2018-01-20 20:32:46 Who? The oil rich ones?
1353 2018-01-20 20:32:45 I can drop my car off for an oil change then walk home & thts where the family mechanic is too

1355 2018-01-20 20:32:27 I didn't really measure flour just put in until it was somewhat smooth and sticky (good descriptions obviously). Then I let it rest for about an hour and worked some olive oil in the sides of my bowl so it didn't stick. Then finally rolled it out, rubbed olive oil on the sheet

Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.

1377 2018-01-20 20:30:24 Thought you used goose fat and oil 50/50 ?
1378 2018-01-20 20:30:18 You clearly don’t. Simply consider the cost of the more recent oil production in the US (over 50$ per barrel) compared to the cost of production in the giant fields in Iran and Saudi at under 5$. Simple economics will show the importance of Mid East oil to an economy addicted

1400 2018-01-20 20:27:10 Thank you. Everything's fine. Just glad my dad was here because it was an oil fire and my mom and I wouldn't have known how to put it out.
1401 2018-01-20 20:27:09 +1 to this.  You're basically only going to get it off by hopefully catching the bits that haven't fully cured with acetone (Or at least softening up the bits that have), then scraping it off your flesh.

Otherwise give it a week and your body will oil it off.  Hopefully. :v
1402 2018-01-20 20:27:05 Finally got this oil change !

1404 2018-01-20 20:26:35 I never give attributions on oil paintings. This defeated the team in Conisbee & al 2009: not good enough to Frago. They didn't consider Ducreux, nor the artist of the Birmingham portrait suggested as a Perronneau autop. I've no idea.
1405 2018-01-20 20:26:25 "It's spicier. It has olive oil in it" is a thing I just heard someone say.

1428 2018-01-20 20:23:17 Listening to episode 202 of Milk Street Kitchen. @cpkimball, you are mentioning a lot of different oils, but not a word about avocado oil. We find it to be a great neutral oil for frying. What are your thoughts on it?
1429 2018-01-20 20:23:06 I'd take more than £30M in oil revenue for starters... And no nukes.  Stop paying for Westminster.  And HS2.  Maybe actually tax Capital Gains.  

But its all irrelevant as £15b deficit is our deficit within the UK.  Not as an independent country.
1430 2018-01-20 20:22:59 I really did mean to go get my oil changed after my parents came back and I could leave the store but my dad started screaming at me and I cried and started having a panic attack while driving so I guess I'm doing it tomorrow instead

1445 2018-01-20 20:20:29 Lmaooo u dont say. I am just putting oil. I live in toronto so i kinda care least 
1446 2018-01-20 20:20:19 @rfpaints Your oil stick paints are much beyond my expectations, much better than @sennelier1887 and @winsorandnewton

1450 2018-01-20 20:19:30 Can you understand the financial model of the olive oil joint? I want them to exist, just can’t understand how.
1451 2018-01-20 20:19:25 Probably one of the crucial differences between the current capitalist system and its earlier incarnations is that the resources that have enabled it are now starting to run out. American silver, British coal, the world's oil reserves, the motor of exploitation runs on fumes.
1452 2018-01-20 20:19:11 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
1453 2018-01-20 20:18:54 Looking for a talented oil painted to paint a Wild West-ish painting of me horseback with a musket with my chaps on and topless....pls let me know if u can make this happen or know anyone who can
1454 2018-01-20 20:18:45 Just learned that the abbreviation for barrels, as in barrels of oil, is “bbls” which seems much too cute sounding for what it is.
1455 2018-01-20 20:18:27 Yeap..What a great day.. Can't wait for L.A.M.O.Lacca Aubamayeng,Mickhi and Oil to link up with us and get those guns blazing with bullets,to start killing some teams.#GUNNERS UNSTOPPABLE.
1456 2018-01-20 20:18:13 Meaning you are confident in the roster as is?
1457 2018-01-20 20:18:09 The rise in world population and increasing living standards of life in China, India, etc are contributing to increase in energy requirements and thus more pressures on fossil fuels, specially oil & gas. Although RE projects are contributing but still their share will remain low.
1458 2018-01-20 20:18:03 I wish I could oil pull and nap at the same time
1459 2018-01-20 20:17:54 i ordered the sunday riley juno oil and i’m so excited
1460 2018-01-20 20:17:35 Depends whether it’s fried in vegetable oil. 
1461 2018-01-20 20:17:32 I am NOT a Republican or Democrat! a Government shutdown happens when the majority party and President refuses to work with the other party on a budget! simply this time its the Republicans and Trumps fault! they only want oil companies and large corporations to win
1462 2018-01-20 20:17:32 Same. Coconut oil clogs my pores. If I use it. I literally use a dab of it.

1465 2018-01-20 20:16:51 @DanielKrawisz Hi Daniel. I read your article "Appcoins Are Snake Oil." You explain why you think altcoins aren't stocks, but you never explain how a stock market could function in a crypto economy. Do you have any thoughts about it? Or have any resources to suggest?
1466 2018-01-20 20:16:48 Anything new research involving Crohns and CBD oil treatment?
1467 2018-01-20 20:16:06 The coup attempts in Venezuela come from within and it’s because the oil rich country’s people wanted communism and now are fighting over dead pigeons to eat !

1470 2018-01-20 20:15:21 MPL black castor oil, add a little weed to it and cap your hair. Works for both relaxed and natural hair
1471 2018-01-20 20:15:18 Shining light on societal issues is not the true goal here. The true goal is to malign half the country as haters and a threat to humanity
1472 2018-01-20 20:15:17 That being said, I was doing well better with the high oil prices under Obama. President's are overrated, the economy largely functions despite federal policy. Federal reserve monetary policy has way more impact.
1473 2018-01-20 20:15:16 What many are having a problem with is that it is being reported by even Trump people that Trump and GOP have agreed to grant amnesty to DACAs and other illegals.  Cotton is fighting that, and that is why dems don't want him in discussions.
1474 2018-01-20 20:15:16 Needed a oil change badly 
1475 2018-01-20 20:15:15 Sitting in waiting room during oil change, unavoidably overhearing two morons discussing shutdown, DACA, and how much they love Ann Coulter. Biting tongue so hard.
1476 2018-01-20 20:15:14 Same. That and coconut oil. Doesn’t work for me.
1477 2018-01-20 20:15:09 i justmade a face mask with eggs, oil, tomatoes, sugar, milk and honey. i think i made big mistake. #homemade
1478 2018-01-20 20:14:46 I know some niggas that drank oil hard and bodies gotta have it. But you won’t catch them drank nothin but shit from the pharm and they drank plenty water
1479 2018-01-20 20:14:19 Indian clay mask and Apple cider vinegar!! But i also use peppermint castille soap with tea tree oil in it (there’s also tea tree kind) and drug my face with it every night! And then moisturize with either Nivea or raw shea butter  works wonders
1480 2018-01-20 20:14:06 I like taking fish oil pills, but it’s so gross when you burp and tastes like a fish is skeeting in your throat
1481 2018-01-20 20:13:29 For the 1st week, people were saying weekdays traders are busy with oil/gold, etc

But weekend indicated even lower volume, i heard 2 contracts (only!!) for saturday

The #CME $btc #Futures concurred w/ #CBoE & media reports.
Low interest, low volume, #Wallstreet staying away
1482 2018-01-20 20:13:27 ok so I’m parked waiting for my turn to get my oil changed and the guy parked next to me is just having like a fucking staring contest with me and isn’t looking away lmao help

1493 2018-01-20 20:12:15 What a stupid post.  What happened to "Who is paying for the wall?"  Saps bought into you Great Negotiators snake oil pitch.
1 year in office?  Govt shutdown.  Who knew. You have the House and Senate. Own it. This is the GOP's fault,
1494 2018-01-20 20:12:11 There’s so much fun to do! 
The government’s shutdown! 
I don’t know where to begin! 
I think I’ll start by vandalizing a National Park; perhaps blow up an oil line and plant a tree. 
That’ll really upset the EPA
1495 2018-01-20 20:11:59 I used coconut oil on my last few as bepanthen is too sticky - worked really well!
1496 2018-01-20 20:11:54 Did you do a good oil check, to make sure is not a post op ladyboy?
1497 2018-01-20 20:11:53 @BraveTart howdy!  What is the role of egg whites in Homemade Nutter Butter©®™ Cookies when made with butter? The vegan variation is just sub coconut oil, leave out eggs, and fridge it before rolling - not sure what to infer from that though.
1498 2018-01-20 20:11:50 And we're all out of oil
1499 2018-01-20 20:11:40 Lmao isn’t there a certain smell or essential oil they don’t like
1500 2018-01-20 20:11:32 Bathed my dog today, applied coconut oil on her coat, and now her bed + blanket is in the wash. She’s definitely spoiled and cared for 
1501 2018-01-20 20:11:20 I could do this, heh. I have two hanging up that had oil that just wouldn't quit.
1502 2018-01-20 20:11:20 How many more dead bodies in the Mediterranean over the oil fields in the Persian Gulf?
1503 2018-01-20 20:11:17 Currently reading Oil 101. Great book!
1504 2018-01-20 20:11:16 You coming over pal? I’ll get the bread and oil out mate ... mulled wine ??

1508 2018-01-20 20:10:25 While getting my oil changed, I’ve already heard Spice Girls, 3LW, and Backstreet Boys. I can’t wait to see what plays next!

1513 2018-01-20 20:09:32 Yeah, I didn't believe it then, either. He's a snake oil salesman.
1514 2018-01-20 20:09:08 Why is it that EVERY time I get my oil changed, I have to go back and tell them I now have an oil leak. 
1515 2018-01-20 20:09:07 Do you only use oil, fuel and windshield wipers sold by the manufacturer?
1516 2018-01-20 20:08:46 Troll level: master class.
1517 2018-01-20 20:08:44 Can you overdose on menthol & albus oil?

1520 2018-01-20 20:07:49 You can level your zip yourself, with a bit of oil and gentle persuasion ....
1521 2018-01-20 20:07:40 Why tf is it some hard to get a oil change 
1522 2018-01-20 20:07:34 If America was after oil would We be taking over Mexico? Venezuela? Or actually drilling here? Oil is everywhere over here  Beside why kill Sadam if America just wanted oil
1523 2018-01-20 20:07:31 This is still not as funny as talking about the "oil slowdown" and the Warmongering US..

1527 2018-01-20 20:06:50 Tough day in an oppressive nation. 

Fruit smoothies, Starbucks, march, healthy afternoon snack at Panera, home to hot shower and Netflix.
1528 2018-01-20 20:06:34 I'm pretty blessed I don't have to do alotto keep my skin clear. Just wash my face every day and night. Vitamin E oil and drink water and I'm good.
1529 2018-01-20 20:05:49 I'm self employed, I don't have a 401k. I put some money in the market when Trump was elected, but expect a crash sometime in the next two years. I certainly didn't listen to Krugman, half my income this year was bitcoin. The rest oil, 10% of which I can thank Trump for DAPL

And more. I URGE people to read the Trump Prophecies.
1537 2018-01-20 20:04:25 yeah honestly i've had a bunch of poor experiences when it comes to car maintenance with that dealership. on the bright side this was the last free oil change i had with my plan so i won't have to deal with it again
1538 2018-01-20 20:04:21 I did the car wash as well, so I say Olive Oil store.
1539 2018-01-20 20:03:59 I put aloe gel and tea tree oil on my face this morning ... terrible idea.
1540 2018-01-20 20:03:54 I bet he was doing elliptical
1541 2018-01-20 20:03:16 Some weeks back, Remember you were talking like you were the best thing after sliced bread.

Fast forward to today, you are now the Secretary General of the Miners and Drillers Association of Nigeria.

Keep going, you'd find oil one day....
1542 2018-01-20 20:03:09 You can capex or opex with Cloud your choice. You don’t need all VLANs on all APs with distributed L3 roaming. Trunks seem better than tunnels ignoring QoS. The sweet spot for legacy controllers is what now? oil rigs and mines?
1543 2018-01-20 20:02:57 just buy some organic coconut oil (like for cooking) and apply with a q-tip  it’s also really useful for hair and dry eyelids 
1544 2018-01-20 20:02:56 เเต่จริงๆ ก็ชอบเเทบทุกฉาก มันอึดอัดบิดเบี้ยวไปหมด
1545 2018-01-20 20:02:38 I started doing a routine: first facewash, then tonic, then daycream, all from teatree oil. it cleared it up a bit but i still have zits occasionally. Care though, could be too harsh on your skin.

1550 2018-01-20 20:02:23 We use oil of organo all the time. Put a couple drops under the feed.
It helps when you have a cold. (OR MAN COLD )my wife calls it LOL
1551 2018-01-20 20:02:22 Possibly because even with all their oil money Citeh can spot a plain daft deal when the see one.

Absolute stupidity of the highest order paying that much for a near thirty year old.

Attempted one upmanship by Yanited.

1555 2018-01-20 20:02:04 Thank you for your kindness Darren. However, I am sure my friend would give in a thousand more times if it meant the children of Syrian slept in peace. However, it's a futile world where our children's blood has become cheaper than oil and dirt.

Children are dying from lack of basic food in an oil rich country whose main client is the USA. How can we use their oil to enjoy the best economy in years, as they die?
1561 2018-01-20 20:01:14 What if ALL the oil companies quietly agreed with mayor and said we are not going to sell our products and services in the NYC metropolitan area effective immediately? Your move mayor.

1567 2018-01-20 20:00:16 Reduced majorly since I started using oils on my face at night. I use marula, you can use vitamin E or argan oil :-)
1568 2018-01-20 20:00:09 Oh, and one last tip: as is mentioned on the package it’s really good on things like eggs and salad and pasta (just olive oil and furikake is delicious), but beyond that even it’s very versatile and I’d recommend trying it on all kinds of things — enjoy!
1569 2018-01-20 20:00:02 i was gonna get pizza but i just decided to chug warm oil instead, almost as good!
1570 2018-01-20 20:00:00 @BLMNational defended their push to auction new oil and gas leases siding with industry representatives, despite thousands of inactive permits, not to mention the environmental degradation and climate change implications of fossil fuel production.  #whataretheythinking
1571 2018-01-20 19:59:40 As oppose to oil companies, who only care about polluting our air w/ noxious chemicals. I assume thats why they do it, Bc as this account has shown, oil companies hate money.
1572 2018-01-20 19:59:29 GB is not the envy of the world.  Not even close.  Go live abroad and you'll quickly find that out.

Why would we be poorer?  Because Westminster says so?  The Westminster who have taken all our oil revenue while Norway have £800B in the bank and have better services?

1584 2018-01-20 19:57:44 Oh yeah sure. DACA is all about allowing immigrants who came to the US. The wall is all about keeping them out. Oil and Water. Democrats and Republicans.
1585 2018-01-20 19:57:42 I was JUST talking to a friend about CBD oil yesterday. I need to do some research, but I heard something similar from her! Sorry about your mom! 
1586 2018-01-20 19:56:59 The only person im jealous of is the person that gets rub oil on Nick Jonas's body
1587 2018-01-20 19:56:57 Imagine how much more expensive both oil and outsourced factory goods would have to be if oil companies and other corporations had to pay the full operating cost of those carrier groups that keep the sea lanes open. And that's just one thing.
1588 2018-01-20 19:56:40 What kind of oil do fast food restaurants use that make french fries dry so quickly. They taste like sponge.
1589 2018-01-20 19:56:29 No. It's about less thn 1 million non Citizens, illegal aliens, holding entire country hostage.
1590 2018-01-20 19:56:21 We'll see. I'm in NYC, odds are my taxes will go up. $10k cap on local deduction. My accountant isn't sure yet, some of the changes to oil and gas help, others hurt. My point still stands, in theory one can pass good economic legislation while also being a respectable leader.
1591 2018-01-20 19:56:20 Guy changing my oil: “Yeah I have a pretty strong theory about whores...” 
1592 2018-01-20 19:56:16 Thought I hated coconut but here I am, eating everything that is made with coconut oil or coconut milk.

1594 2018-01-20 19:56:16 Oil is sticky
1595 2018-01-20 19:56:11 I dont want to put more oil to the fire but for those who claim no physical no buy, PC is the leading platform with most sales goes on digital rather than physical
And with games that get really heavy on consoles

1596 2018-01-20 19:56:03 KSA does not have 40% spare capacity in crude.  The KSA deficit is still large, and the F-Ex holdings have been tapped.  Oil is the engine, and the engine is sputtering at 70, stalling at 60.  KSA is not a stable government without huge social spending.  USTO is reasonably stable
1597 2018-01-20 19:55:42 #ThoughtsOfA5YearOld Cod Liver Oil - yuck!
1598 2018-01-20 19:55:37 Two things: what about over estimation of shale and quality being lighter  and if the dollar went down won’t that keep oil up?
1599 2018-01-20 19:55:26 Lol we will and if I remember have Abigail oil them up for you because everything is better when It's wet!!!
1600 2018-01-20 19:55:11 Remember the Greeks produce a lot of olive oil
1601 2018-01-20 19:55:08 Water #IN for building algae farms #OpenRailwayForestEdge 
Algae (oil or dried, ...) that is not needed #OUT #OpenRailwayForestEdge
1602 2018-01-20 19:55:02 Boiling hot oil on my foot. Ouch
1603 2018-01-20 19:54:58 My oil ran out first. Still got all the three and I’m cheating by using native child oil I’ve had for over a century.
1604 2018-01-20 19:54:52 It is clever and inoffensive
1605 2018-01-20 19:54:33 I went to a barbershop in Eritrea back in 2011, and I'm still rubbing Black castor oil on my hairline to this day. 
1606 2018-01-20 19:54:29 See wayo curving
1607 2018-01-20 19:54:24 Tipper det er etter oddsen Fisken selv setter. Er enig i det meste, men usikker på VIFhausinga. Sparta og i alle fall LIK ryker fort i kvart mot lag 5 og 6. Frisk tar VIF om det blir dem. Oil fav uansett motstander i kvart. Svak mot Frisk, noe større mot Sparta, klink mot LIK.
1608 2018-01-20 19:54:09 I didn’t say you were a racist. I said you were a bigot. And you are. Yes America has always been after a steady supply of oil. That’s a fact. Only idiots don’t realise that. ‘Death to America’ has been political and not mainstream. USA is not a race
1609 2018-01-20 19:54:04 WE CAN use our military that fight for our freedoms ( not corp special interests for mining or oil drillin LOL ) at home GOP+DT to REBUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE- not DT's dam WALL= why 700B to Corps+our military all working on USA needs= well that would be far better.
1610 2018-01-20 19:54:03 add hair products to that, cuz finding ones without coconut oil that properly treat natural hair is TAXING.
1611 2018-01-20 19:53:54 i’ll eat ya pussy and change ya oil and differential oil after on a routine basis.  #reallytho
1612 2018-01-20 19:53:45 Tired level: 
Millisecond away from sprinkling Robinson’s Fruit and Barley Peach over my veg instead of oil

1614 2018-01-20 19:53:28 That’s where I get my beard oil from big fracts
1615 2018-01-20 19:53:21 Isn't it marvelous how Trump skirted around Florida convieniantly skipping Mara Largo as a potential oil dip stick so to speak. How much more transparent can one be to perform an " in your face " ?
1616 2018-01-20 19:53:19 I am sure the Polish Jews did not come to #Palestine with chick peas and olive oil. Hummos is not an Israeli food and neither is the Falafel.
1617 2018-01-20 19:53:16 Why put Prodl on when clearly unfit and injured and slower than an oil tanker - marriappa was on the bench too
1618 2018-01-20 19:53:13 Carrot seed is the shit. Especially if you've used products that have bleached your skin, carrot seed oil will bring that color back to your skin. I promise you.
1619 2018-01-20 19:53:05 One way is for the world to boycott all companies that do business with Nigeria. We should stop buying their products. We should stop buying oil from Nigeria and stopped giving money to Nigeria. We should placed sanctions Nigeria and freeze all the assets of Nigeria abroad.
1620 2018-01-20 19:52:54 Shea butter & coconut oil on my skin>  on my hair
1621 2018-01-20 19:52:46 Dinner tonight is half a roasted cauli, with Nigella green sauce (coriander, lime, garlic, salt, oil, greatly reduced jalapeno content on account of mai delicate stomach), and is bloody lovely. And vegan.

1623 2018-01-20 19:52:31 You may need an oil change
1624 2018-01-20 19:52:00 So far as I know antifreeze leaked into my oil or they tightened my oil pressure to tight . Could be both, i wont know until monday when my mechanic can get out here
1625 2018-01-20 19:52:00 No. Both parties spent like drunken sailors. Why debt doubled. Unfunded spending was wild.
1626 2018-01-20 19:51:59 Hmph, why should I have to change the oil in my car? It doesn't need that.

By the way, what is that clicking noise coming out of my engine? Goddamn manufacturers!
1627 2018-01-20 19:51:50 got some vitamin e oil to clear these dark spots 
1628 2018-01-20 19:51:45 I might be getting my ass kicked by a menstrual migraine today but I’m still getting shit done I deserve a reward. Dentist, oil changed, post office visited. The Excedrin migraine is doing work
1629 2018-01-20 19:51:41 Not only that, but there’s plenty of “warm oil” in perfectly healthy dishes, too. This logic is so weird.
1630 2018-01-20 19:51:39 Ke tlo apply coconut oil e, ke batla go bona glowing skin. Especially the legs because  Mme o mphile shem!
1631 2018-01-20 19:51:29 Yes they are. They’re in almost every Supermarket in the aisle where you buy cooking oil. Look for “cold pressed” on the label- they’re best
1632 2018-01-20 19:51:22 Has he actually done anything bar piss off Arab countries with no money or oil.
1633 2018-01-20 19:51:12 Coconut oil after a hot shower is EVERYTHING
1634 2018-01-20 19:51:08 قالي تاكسي باليونان 

You are swimming in oil 
1635 2018-01-20 19:50:59 The province is overly reliant on oil and oil related products for its economy. Maybe it’s time to evolve and not become dinosaurs like they are pulling from the ground
1636 2018-01-20 19:50:44 even in Gran Canaria - no oil, the cost per L is about 40p less
1637 2018-01-20 19:50:19 Fresh oil change makes the car happy
1638 2018-01-20 19:50:17 OBC is kind of cliched and not really on point.  MacT & staff were good coaches and brought Oil last flirt with glory. MacT not GM long enough to blink.  Lowe has certainly had ups and downs.  This is a pervasive systematic perpetual "old boys club"?????
1639 2018-01-20 19:50:13 Stop funding the Saudis! Don't buy blood oil from Shell!
1640 2018-01-20 19:50:11 Pure Clove Oil on tender Mucus Membranes-not that 'set ' of lips -

1641 2018-01-20 19:50:08 No bigger scam than the recommended air filter change while getting oil change. No shit its dirty. It would be a miracle if it wasnt.
1642 2018-01-20 19:49:56 We love your streams and consistence. Big up!
1643 2018-01-20 19:49:56 Both sides got off the same ship with pockets full of money. The party only ended at the literal end.
1644 2018-01-20 19:49:42 Trends:
1- news stories on oil and oil prices
2- books on oiland oil prices
3- students in petroleum engineering and related fields and oil prices
4- oil related govt comettes and oil prices
1645 2018-01-20 19:49:42 Cucumbers Avacado olive oil all in one amazing for lunch

1650 2018-01-20 19:48:51 Man U has always dominated. We didn't need oil money to build the club and make it a success
1651 2018-01-20 19:48:43 My skin was so dry it actually hurt, I just put the oil all over my face at night time after cleanser, and after like 3 nights the red patches were all gone!

1654 2018-01-20 19:48:18 He's not one of those glory supporters is he Jim? As soon as the oil money came in he switched to chelsea? 
1655 2018-01-20 19:48:01 Nope. Pepper mint oil is the truth
1656 2018-01-20 19:47:56 Yep. A pivotal moment in Zack’s life though. He learned a lot that day. That presentation in fromt of Cal Star oil exec at the end is what leaders do.
1657 2018-01-20 19:47:53 you don't need to reply to dis but I think you've done pretty well so far and you should be proud of yourself ^^ it may seem hopeless at times but I think life is worth living. ADD OIL!!!
1658 2018-01-20 19:47:42 I was on a new level of bored yesterday.. I spent 2 hrs and 40 min at @Ross_Stores carrying around two hats and an oil dispenser. Contemplating which I “needed”more.. realized I needed none, but figured I had been there too long to leave empty handed..
1659 2018-01-20 19:47:28 Well, like Standard Oil, if you give a company 50+ years of monopoly protection, how can you expect to create a free market, at the drop of a hat?
AT&T break up led to innovation and lower prices.
1660 2018-01-20 19:47:19 Been using bio oil for like 10 months now and my skin???? Near perfection  i’m almost on my bfs level 
1661 2018-01-20 19:46:55 Well, not if he starts Turkish oil wrestling match with it first.
1662 2018-01-20 19:46:55 Well there’s $800 plus out of my account and I still need an oil change  adulting is so fun
1663 2018-01-20 19:46:54 Got my brother's oil changed in his car, filled it up with gas and went grocery shopping. Moved my $$$ I got for my car and opened up a savings account #ProductiveDay
1664 2018-01-20 19:46:53 They're Celebrating your damage:

Promotes/deregulates GMOs,
Renews Surveillance,
Gives huge sum of $ to Saudi Arabia(9-11)
Reopening oil drilling(BP Oil spill), 
Criminalizes marijuana,
Privatizing prisons,
Rolls back regulation on banks for crash of 2008 
Worst example to kids
1665 2018-01-20 19:46:37 I  just use the gamsol. Have used stand oil and other mediums but for me, the solvent works best.
1666 2018-01-20 19:46:22 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
1667 2018-01-20 19:46:20 I don't think it boosted it, but clearly did not reduce it neither. I consume plenty of potatoes, olive oil, raisins, nuts, leafy veg etc. which is likely more responsible, also much heavy lifting at work..soy is good for bone density
1668 2018-01-20 19:46:18 Had to come get this oil changed   
1669 2018-01-20 19:45:54 Oh. I got that one too.... unbelievable coming from Jack.
1670 2018-01-20 19:45:44 The idiot governor of New York won't let any more oil products into the state. He's been paid-off by the green lobby to do that. This horrendously bad winter has caused most New Yorkers to FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZE !!!  Cuomo did it!
1671 2018-01-20 19:45:42 Religion/politics and the TRUTH are like oil mixed with water.
1672 2018-01-20 19:45:15 So did Prescott Bush sell oil to the Germans !  Fact !
.
.  That's what a crime family does, crimes!
1673 2018-01-20 19:45:13 ME [after putting coconut oil on my dry skin]: Do I smell nice?
WIFE: Mmmm yeah
ME: Well, I'm Bounty
WIFE: ...
1674 2018-01-20 19:45:07 Pro tip: don't use rancid vegetable oil when making cookies. They will make you sick. Seriously, don't do it.
1675 2018-01-20 19:45:06 #AbsurdProductIdeas Fat Free Oil
1676 2018-01-20 19:45:03 Yes it says beard hair and tattoo oil
1677 2018-01-20 19:44:48 Expensive or cheap oil and US priorities.
1) Make cheap oil to crash RF income.
2) Make oil expensive to let USD centric IMS survive (doing seppuku, exporting technology, jobs) and letting world finance deficits.
Which wins?
1678 2018-01-20 19:44:47 貴音爆誕祭‼︎
1679 2018-01-20 19:44:33 @DeptofDefense Turkey supported ISIS, bought stolen oil from ISIS and housed ISIS fighters when they weren't fighting. The Kurds fought ISIS. Why are we letting Turkey bomb them after they sacrificed their lives to defeat evil? Why aren't we helping them defen #Efrin ...SHAMEFUL.
1680 2018-01-20 19:44:31 Oooh hey look at this  !  I guess this is America’s fault ! Hmm I bet it’s because America wants cheep oil  oh no wait it’s because Christians are toxic !
Hope the Kurds get their own State. Completely legit ! They are being attacked by Syria,turkey,Iraq and Iran
1681 2018-01-20 19:44:27 Couldn't find my coconut oil tho
1682 2018-01-20 19:44:27 Lmao because they don’t oil their scalp and edges or give their hair a break . Keeping my bori baby hairs 4eva

1685 2018-01-20 19:44:01 my parents really left me coconut oil, applesauce, and hummus to survive on. thank u.
1686 2018-01-20 19:43:56 Like Mexico sold oil to the Germans...
1687 2018-01-20 19:43:37 Grab  your Bibles and bullets, 
And oil up your gun,
Patriots are getting angry,
And we are about to start having fun.
1688 2018-01-20 19:43:30 I think he's right in the sense that ENDING government activity like oil wars, eminent domain and liability cps for pipelines, transportation subsidies, &c that actively promote CO2 emissions, emissions would drop precipitously beyond anything imagined in Kyoto or Paris.
1689 2018-01-20 19:43:28 I have said this time and again. Wonder what gave us the entitlement mentality over oil we did not put in the ground. Hardwork is king!
1690 2018-01-20 19:43:13 Check your Engine oil today.
1691 2018-01-20 19:42:51 Sounds like Oil ready to field a team from the 80’s. Likely going to have better success doing that then with current roster.
1692 2018-01-20 19:42:50 Remember, the $1 You earn today pays you twice. Once now, once in the future. 
Don't spend it all now. Plan for the decades ahead.
1693 2018-01-20 19:41:49 So they're a load of loan players who want to do well s they can go back to their clubs? Doesn't sound like we're building a team for next year then? Someone oil that revolving door!
1694 2018-01-20 19:41:37 Open nets and Flyers are like oil and water, they just don't go together.

1697 2018-01-20 19:41:01 @TestKitchen Loved the Penang Beef recipe and demo. For those who may be allergic to fish oil, is there a recommended substitute?
1698 2018-01-20 19:41:00 I use the Teddie Organics Rose Hip oil and have been happy with it!
1699 2018-01-20 19:40:47 Does that say TATTOO OIL??

1701 2018-01-20 19:40:10 No complaints today. The oil millionaires are a different class and the majority of their starters cost over £30m each. Under McClaren we would have conceded 10 tonight but Rafa has sorted it out. Defended well for 90 minutes

1704 2018-01-20 19:39:57 If you need synthetic oil Styles has the best price hands down.
1705 2018-01-20 19:39:48 Buy some of those empty brush pens on Amazon and I'll fill them with cuticle oil for you. I have two giant bottles of vit E and jojoba. Then when you wanna pick the dry skin, oil up instead.
1706 2018-01-20 19:39:37 انهلك وفينا الصالحون ؟
1707 2018-01-20 19:39:32 @BuffaloSabres This team is PATHETIC. All starts with the owners who allow this to happen. Zero accountability and zero clue how to build a winner. Stick to oil and natural gas Terry
1708 2018-01-20 19:39:29 Beard oil works wonders
1709 2018-01-20 19:39:19 Don’t compare fergie era and peps be serious man lol . Things change money comes in lol if you think pep could win the league without city’s oil money back then then you’re deluded .
1710 2018-01-20 19:39:09 Bring wood and oil!
1711 2018-01-20 19:39:08 Monday I'm getting an oil change!
1712 2018-01-20 19:38:55 But not with coconut oil because it’s trash
1713 2018-01-20 19:38:52 My fave prepoo: hot oil treatment. I mix oils (olive, coconut, castor) in a little bowl and put it in a bigger bowl of hot water to warm up.
1714 2018-01-20 19:38:33 Taking your car to get oil changes <<
1715 2018-01-20 19:38:26 This will be a record year for potholes in Indy. I saw one so deep oil was gushing from it. At another, the fire department rescued a family of six.
1716 2018-01-20 19:38:09 also I am a HUGE fan of epsom salt + essential oil baths - not only because the aroma + heat is great, it delivers a lot of magnesium to your system which helps boost positive brain chemistry (literally beats winter "blues")
1717 2018-01-20 19:38:04 Baby oil, lotion, sunblock ghaaad. 
1718 2018-01-20 19:37:45 Doesn’t matter. You can say that about all the ex Oil players that work for them now. Time to stop with the good ole boys club. Hasn’t worked for a long time now.
1719 2018-01-20 19:37:44 I don't agree on Big Oil, GAS, MINING, AND TIMBER destroying sacred land for CASH. I think the Native Community has lost enough.
1720 2018-01-20 19:37:36 It comes off with oil. That’s what breaks down a liquid lipstick
1721 2018-01-20 19:37:35 I just paid my student loan bill while waiting for my oil to be changed. This adulting thing is no fun. 
1722 2018-01-20 19:37:31 Oil pulling 
1723 2018-01-20 19:37:26 I’m confused and can’t tell what resonates with eco-terrorists. Ethical Oil, Moral case, pays for health care, not  killing etc don’t seem to matter to the radical enviro. Change has to happen to AB can get a world price for our Oil & Gas.
1724 2018-01-20 19:37:26 Oh now I am a racist ! Yeah Blame it on America !  I guess the Wars being waged is because America wants cheep oil is next !  Get a grip take a look at the picture again  who is screaming Death to America and Death to Israel ?who is racist?
1725 2018-01-20 19:37:23 Yes....suspect too much inflammatory high omega 6 GE canola oil nobody bothered to toxicology trial can make a boy agitated.People with #tau in a terrible tangle need an extra virgin #olivefarmer
1726 2018-01-20 19:37:22 Spin spin spin. The salesman has more snake oil for us to buy.
1727 2018-01-20 19:37:01 SHAMELESS 
1728 2018-01-20 19:36:44 Having a car is expensive, car note, car insurance, gas , oil changes, tires , and anything underneath the hood needs fixing . Eventually that shit adds up .
1729 2018-01-20 19:36:13 I have a free oil change for today if anyone wants it
1730 2018-01-20 19:36:13 I Luv Vodka!  Spritzer for your linens: 1c Vodka + 1c H2O + 16 drops essential oil: to disinfect & freshen
1731 2018-01-20 19:36:07 It means doing a treatment with oil or conditioner before washing to protect your hair from being overly stripped by the shampoo.
1732 2018-01-20 19:35:46 Finally broke down today and bought butter. I can’t live off olive oil any more

1735 2018-01-20 19:35:20 Actually, ISIS were shipping oil tankers to the Turkish border.

Turkey, Saudi and Qatar back the FSA which includes Al Qaeda. They are Islamists. They want to turn Syria into an Islamic State, like ISIS

Assad protects religious minorities. So do the Kurds. Islamists murder them
1736 2018-01-20 19:35:16 Can't Sleep? Apply some lavender oil to your temples to help you relax and fall asleep.
1737 2018-01-20 19:35:06 History never dies. Even with oil money you've never won at Anfield.
1738 2018-01-20 19:34:58 Any of my friends in the Oil industry? Or know of anyone to tag?

Let's see...
1740 2018-01-20 19:34:46 This is rad! I'd say do some practice with skin tones, even reference resources like oil painting tutorials. Skin is full of colors — red, green, blue, yellow. Getting the right mix of them will really help with realism.
1741 2018-01-20 19:34:40 I would so rub baby oil into that hot body @nickjonas would luv to giv him a good fuckin would feel soo good we’d luv it!

M: “oh so you know how to do it?”

Me: “... no”

1745 2018-01-20 19:33:22 Bought new gas and oil for snowblower. That should scare away the forecasted snow. Unless tweeting about it counteracts this...?
1746 2018-01-20 19:33:18 From the oil well to the pitbike race
1747 2018-01-20 19:33:17 No!

1748 2018-01-20 19:33:04 This rose essential oil smells so heavenly
1749 2018-01-20 19:32:49 The flame is only heating up the piston walls for a few milliseconds, so the aluminium's temperature is far below the flame temp.
Oil lubricant protects the aluminium from erosion during these milliseconds.
1750 2018-01-20 19:32:38 Ok time to go be a grown up & get my oil changed....I'm only 700 miles past due 
1751 2018-01-20 19:32:31 I used egg, hair mayo, olive oil, coconut oil, castor oil and a drop of vanilla essence bc I hate hate hate just the thought even of egg.
1752 2018-01-20 19:32:31 Canada will now sell its oil to China because @realdonaldtrump rejected Keystone. At least China knows a good deal when they see it.

There is a reason why they refer to " Our friends across the isle, My esteemed colleague."
1758 2018-01-20 19:32:05 FoxConn is building a factory in WI adding 13,000 new high tech jobs and thus will create more jobs. Apple is investing $350 Billion in expansion in US, more jobs. We have surpassed Saudi Arabia in the  production of oil. More jobs. Chrysler is moving there truck factory to MI.
1759 2018-01-20 19:31:48 try castor oil Varrassi! :)
1760 2018-01-20 19:31:43 Ahhh, the machinery of our government. Dems have workings & wheels that build infrastructures, help the poor, foster the sciences, back workers, get more people educated. It's out of gas. GOP is a pocket emptying hooptie. It needs oil every five miles, only turns right & crashes
1761 2018-01-20 19:31:17 I bought a Lotto ticket and booked a ski trip in Hell after seeing this.
1762 2018-01-20 19:31:11 Turkey is absolutely not siding with the Islamists. That was/is Assad. You don't actually believe Russian and Assad propaganda do you? lol, Assad was nailed for buying oil from ISIS, absolutely caught red handed.
1763 2018-01-20 19:30:44 Palm oil is bad for you and the environment!!!!! Even sustainable palm oil is bad for you!!!! Stop!!!!!!!!!!

1766 2018-01-20 19:30:32 So deep I found oil

1776 2018-01-20 19:29:04 today I realized my tags expired 3 months ago but before I can get new ones I need an echeck but I also need an oil change before I can do that and I have $10
1777 2018-01-20 19:28:51 So you said "I used". I say "no" they used. I sent my tweet using power from my solar power setup. Other than the plastics in my phone "I, me" did not use oil. Yes indirectly oil was used by the company. I request they stop. Oil is not a must its a easily marketable convenience.
1778 2018-01-20 19:28:33 I use wen, shea moisture black castor oil line and Curls
1779 2018-01-20 19:28:23 It’s a traditional oil extracted from anchovies
1780 2018-01-20 19:28:12 Who signed up for that oil pipeline to run through tribal land?
1781 2018-01-20 19:27:29 "Free fall" was in reference to sustainables. There's *been* war in the Middle East for those same decades; US production and sustainables have been preventing oil prices from rising.
1782 2018-01-20 19:27:23 It works on any kind of headaches. You put some oil on your temples and it works like magic!
1783 2018-01-20 19:27:22 You know that:
- diluent contains benzene, a carcinogen and flammable light oils / condensate. 
- this tank farm will triple the storage in Burnaby.
- there is a history of oil and gas storage facility fires.

And that:
- the school is 300m away from the nearest tank.

1787 2018-01-20 19:26:26 Excellent again from #mcfc. Quite how they have managed to use the oil money to buy the best players and keep winning games is truly remarkable. Pep is a genius.
1788 2018-01-20 19:26:17 Lady gave me 5$ off my oil change. I feel like I’m important today lol
1789 2018-01-20 19:25:32 Wife’s got Take Me Out on, one of them shows I wouldn’t watch on my own but secretly enjoy it when it’s on. But, I can honestly say that over 90% of the birds on there are beyond horrendous. Just awful. I’m no oil painting but I’d walk out of that lift and get straight back in.
1790 2018-01-20 19:25:20 Yes, it’s as disruptive, harmful, and wasteful as the #taxscam that you voted for to please big oil and your donors! LETS NOT FORGET!

1816 2018-01-20 19:20:08 Was it once "Legal" to commit genocide on the actual native Americans? "Legal" to steal a whole race from another continent and enslave them, and when they finally get freedom treat them second rate for the next century? "Legal" to invade any country with oil? "Legal" when suits?

1852 2018-01-20 19:13:47 Amazing how subjective these "accomplishments" are. Actions are not successes, it's the quality and results of the actions. Can someone detail for me these 860 deregulations some of which were for oil and gas? Deregulation at the expense of our environment is not "success"
1853 2018-01-20 19:13:38 It's a must in my daily skin care routine! I love using the vitamin c serum with the youth activating oil 🖒
1854 2018-01-20 19:13:24 Absolute truth I want to see a mass switchover to alternative energy sources asap...it would be a dream come true for me if humanity could organize it in such a way that we collapsed Big Oil's profits out from under their feet so suddenly that it took them by surprise.
1855 2018-01-20 19:13:23 Welp looks like I’m eating oil for dinner with the price that oil change just cost me
1856 2018-01-20 19:13:12 Maybe #FLORIDA should go back to horse & cart for their transport needs? This #NotInMyBackyard attitude must stop. Oh, and the industry must be SEVERELY punished for every oil spill.

I am the context.
1864 2018-01-20 19:12:37 I wish the worlds super powers would naff off home. Leave the cradle to sort itself out. Civilizations grew and died in this area for Eons. 
You have no rights to interfere. You only care for oil wealth, all of you.
1865 2018-01-20 19:12:28 You really need to fasten this bill. Cos in few years to come very few will have the need for our crude oil. With American shale and its politics in forcing people voluntarily or non voluntarily to buy the products it will be a very difficult time for us to compete

1870 2018-01-20 19:11:49 The unions have a place however it has turned into a runaway train in NL from the government services to no Oil and Gas operators wanting to build anything here in NL because of the inefficiency and added cost
1871 2018-01-20 19:11:48 @EugenieSage are you going to be looking at the relentless seismic blasting that is happening in the Taranaki basin where Blue Whales and penguins are trying to live? are you going to also look at oil exploration in that area before or after the Maui Dolphin is wiped out?

We still don’t know how many died in PR. No wall. No CHIP. Tax breaks for the rich. GOP congress running to retire.
1880 2018-01-20 19:10:50 Yes, I know it was Bakken crude. Even though the CBC and most national media ignored that. Just as there is little or no reporting on whether oil trains are now running again through Lac Megantic.
1881 2018-01-20 19:10:36 استاذ عثمان , المشكله ان EIA وغيرها من الامريكان ذكرو في تقارير لهم في سنة 2014 و 2015 انهم لحتي الان لم يتأكدون من جدوة الصخري والكميات الموجوده , والكميات اللي يقدرون يستخروجنها, وفوق ذلك تكلفته في الحفر و الكمبليشن و سرعة الانخفاض في الانتاج للبئر.
لو طلبت التقارير حقك, تجيك
1882 2018-01-20 19:10:19 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
1883 2018-01-20 19:10:13 That's wonderful! Water or oil?
1884 2018-01-20 19:10:06 this tea tree oil does wonders with my skin 
1885 2018-01-20 19:09:57 I put the wrong oil on my lashes and Thanks to it, my eyes are on  right now 
1886 2018-01-20 19:09:39 Both NStars and Stars had the Oil's number haha. i guess it was good that the financial woes of the oilers resulted in a continual sell-off of players. It gave Nstars a chance, Mario got 2 cups, and Rangers ended their drought.
1887 2018-01-20 19:09:37 Do they have on demand water heaters that run in Oil or is it better to just have the coil in the boiler? We have a 40 gallon tank.
1888 2018-01-20 19:09:30 Oil field
1889 2018-01-20 19:09:27 You started the oil joint already?
1890 2018-01-20 19:09:11 The rice bright cleansing oil always has such bad reviews. Tell me how that goes. Will check out the site soon. Also that Secret Key essence is good.
1891 2018-01-20 19:09:03 I detangle while I prepoo, after deep conditioning and lightly when I use my Leave-in Conditioner. Finally I seal with oil or hair butter
1892 2018-01-20 19:08:43 If this was happening next door, the least I would do is put up a fence/wall.
1893 2018-01-20 19:08:35 @pterrys Research,   You disappoint.  Today I ordered two burgers. The assistant read my order three times to make sure it was what I was ordering, when I got home,  my order had onions. YUK!!! Also please change the  FF oil more often.
1894 2018-01-20 19:08:20 Boy are you still around? I thought that you were out of business. Why you persist in public shame of the Notley for no damn reason is beyond me. The NDP are on their bellies before big oil. They are spending billions of C tax money to make the industry innovate. @RachelNotley

1901 2018-01-20 19:07:28 Some lady has apparently been driving her car for over a year with the oil light on and she's surprised that her engine is making noises

HOW

Well ,olive oil instead of Kebe to keep the Weight in check or for overall health.
1903 2018-01-20 19:06:53 i turned abbachios wine into olive oil. thats for the piss you dick
1904 2018-01-20 19:06:40 Mr @dpradhanbjp can be awarded to respond on all the highlights except for the Petroleum oil Industry and it's problems. 

There is something called Petrol, Diesel,  Dealer, OMC hiltershahi etc.. existing on this earth.

1905 2018-01-20 19:06:15 I couldn’t even question it i just accepted it and fell in love made some whiting with no oil or breading and it came out with crunchy skin? I’m a fan
1906 2018-01-20 19:06:05 So why the fuck are they just now  updating my software on my fucking car if I always bring it in for a fucking oil change ?
1907 2018-01-20 19:06:03 2 more recipes with thyme essential oil are coming to the blog this month!
1908 2018-01-20 19:05:57 Rub you down in baby oil, now you shinin 
1909 2018-01-20 19:05:48 Avoid any and all @KenTowerys  locations.  Simple oil change and tire rotation results in a mysterious wheel bearing issue that wasn’t there until after the work was done.  “Must have shifted when were rotating the tires.  Here’s a estimate for $400.”

1912 2018-01-20 19:05:13 So subsidies for oil, gas, uranium and coal good; subsidies for renewables bad?

FYI Wind is more efficient than solar PV. It takes no more than five semis - one for each blade (3 blades), one nacelle, and one turbine tower - to bring a wind turbine to a site.
1913 2018-01-20 19:05:02 WHY CURDI MUST PAY ? IF ISIL PUSHED DOWN THE OIL PRICE ? NO CURDI PEOPLE RESPONSABILITIES
1914 2018-01-20 19:05:02 Thanks 
1915 2018-01-20 19:05:00 Is there any owners of oil tankers that are of black decent?

I would love to partner with you, send the white mutants back to Europe on an oil tanker, or series of them! 

We need a serious mutant eradication and oil tankers seem like just the vessel to use!
1916 2018-01-20 19:04:55 I have a peppermint and charcoal scrub shampoo that feels amazing and then used a coconut oil treatment post-wash to retain moisture. Feels great!
1917 2018-01-20 19:04:52 @laurenkoslow what r those beautiful nails the oil slick looking ones. Love em want em where can I get em
1918 2018-01-20 19:04:49 3 hours and still going waiting for this oil change........
1919 2018-01-20 19:04:49 #DidYouKnow  J. M. W. Turner depicted the fishermen of #Shoeburyness in his oil painting Shoeburyness Fishermen Hailing a Whitstable Hoy.
1920 2018-01-20 19:04:38 No oil at all shit is magical
1921 2018-01-20 19:04:34 Guys I’ve been so productive today

I bought groceries
Cleaned my entire apartment
Did the dishes
Did my laundry
Got gas
Got my oil changed
Aaaaand it’s barely 1pm
1922 2018-01-20 19:04:31 It’s quite simple now. I prepoo with oil (if I’m going to use shampoo), then I wash or co-wash and deep condition. Every 1-2 weeks
1923 2018-01-20 19:04:11 You clearly know nothing about Russia or Syria. There is no such culture within Russia or Syria. Stop lying. Assad denied the US an oil pipeline, that’s why they want regime change, as the pipeline would allow cheaper US oil into Europe. Informed people see through your lies.
1924 2018-01-20 19:04:09 Seriously...this is the crap you are reporting on? What about flint? Oil spills all over, a #CleanDreamAct, police killing people all over the country, medicare for all.
If you want to focus on trump and his sexual issues go work for a rag mag. #TrumpShutdown
1925 2018-01-20 19:03:52 Why is there virgin Olive oil? Who’s out here fucking the oil?
1926 2018-01-20 19:03:42 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
1927 2018-01-20 19:03:21 My LRT should honestly be printed out poster size and framed and hung in a museum. This is the art we, as a society, make now. I realize the oil paintings and marble sculptures and stuff were “better” but get used to it.
1928 2018-01-20 19:03:19 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong.
1929 2018-01-20 19:03:15 Everyone gets a seat and a bucket of oil
1930 2018-01-20 19:03:12 Whatever they did, it pales in comparison to mass genocide over oil so...

1932 2018-01-20 19:02:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
1933 2018-01-20 19:02:25 Very true this one was because of a bad head gasket job lots of coolant in oil for 700 plus miles. Still runs great just a knock above 3 k rpm
1934 2018-01-20 19:02:13 If I had to pick a super power it would be smelling like Moroccan oil 24/7
1935 2018-01-20 19:02:09 I absolutely agree! To me, fracking reveals just how corrupt and dangerous Big Oil us and how determined they are to force fossil fuel use on humanity until it runs out. I am equally as determined to see that plot undermined.

1941 2018-01-20 19:00:57 That sardin oil is the most exciting part for me.
1942 2018-01-20 19:00:22 @ProSyndicate £300 for your defender is pretty good dude. It cost me £700 for 3 oil pipes for my rx-8. They had to be imported as they don’t hald them in the uk. That was a rip month

1950 2018-01-20 18:59:03 That's because gun permits and oil permits cease during shutdowns… they're such idiots.
1951 2018-01-20 18:58:44 I pre pooed my hair this morning...and was supposed to co wash my hair this evening but that didn’t happen so I’ll be smelling like coconut oil and sweet almond oil all day tmrw until I wash it out lmbo #JuicesandBerries
1952 2018-01-20 18:58:39 nothing more boring than waiting for an oil change

1954 2018-01-20 18:58:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1955 2018-01-20 18:58:35 "Olives are pressed for pure oil,

Flowers are crushed for scented perfumes.

So if you feel pressured, remember it's Allah who is getting the best out of you."
1956 2018-01-20 18:58:23 All of them, it really depends of the material. I love satin or mat varnish for graphite/charcoal. For my oil painting, I have a special recipe based on an old technic.
1957 2018-01-20 18:58:20 Do you have oregano oil?

1959 2018-01-20 18:58:14 If you want to keep on supporting these snake oil salesman, keep giving them money, You should google some of these pastors and see where your money is going. You should especially check out their "houses" that you support.

1966 2018-01-20 18:56:48 Olive oil works, feels horrible but works after a while
1967 2018-01-20 18:56:23 Serve with a red wine jus.I had it with truffle oil chips and root veg mash
1968 2018-01-20 18:56:16 No expensive spa testament or gray market sexual service could feel better than the bowl of warm coconut oil I just rubbed into the open wound of my dry scalp
1969 2018-01-20 18:55:48 Got a new battery in my car from the Auto shop (alternator is charging) and for an oil change and they forget to do the oil change. :/

1973 2018-01-20 18:55:00 Mix some truffle oil, juniper berry and black pepper (ground in a pestle and mortar) and brush onto the steak. Sear it in a hot pan, roughly 30 seconds per side, to brown it. then turn down the heat, add some butter to the pan and baste the steak, let rest for 10 mins.
1974 2018-01-20 18:54:48 Cannabis or hemp oil mate, a drop you take a few times a day or vape and helps with recovery, stress, anxiety, general well being & lots more. Give it a google for better info. It’s non psychoactive so you don’t get high from it and 100% legal

1978 2018-01-20 18:54:31 Dip the old naan in water, let it rest for 10 min, then use butter or oil to crisp up the naan, like you make a normal paratha. Its really delicious, a must try.
1979 2018-01-20 18:54:28 Snakes oil? Tell FSB to give you an English upgrade. You aren’t remotely believable.
1980 2018-01-20 18:54:19 ok im so mad I just got a new oil free moisturizer and it just made my face oily. My face isnt dry anymore but now what
1981 2018-01-20 18:54:12 How many more major honours have you won than United since oil f.c was founded pal? 

You know if your gonna chat , you should probably check ya history. 
1982 2018-01-20 18:53:51 How do we explain that in 2018 we have refineries that are inactive, and even if fully active, won't be able to meet our daily demand for oil products? Poor planning by leaders, it's what has affected us till now. We've failed terribly in putting necessary infrastructure in place
1983 2018-01-20 18:53:49 Got muscled by my daughter into eating at McDonalds today. Hadn’t eaten there in years but the burgers taste like I remember. Like they were slow cooked in motor oil
1984 2018-01-20 18:53:47 I use Clean & Clear Morning Burst, then Dickinson Hydrating Witch Hazel, Ambi Fade Cream & then Clean & Clear Oil Free Moisturizer 
1985 2018-01-20 18:53:44 Can’t let that happen? What you gonna do about it snake oil salesmen? Negotiate one of the tremendous greatest deals of all time? We know you’re the steady genius and know more the anybody on this earth you even know more then the Generals do! So what you gonna do #TrumpShutdown?
1986 2018-01-20 18:53:34 Omg I got the oil service for free. I’m probably going to die soon. Or they fucked up something

1992 2018-01-20 18:52:18 During Jonathan's tenure, we had cabal in the oil sector, but now we have cabal in Aso Villa. They even locked up the president.
1993 2018-01-20 18:52:18 Niggas jumped on a trend from that came from Houston and didn’t do the research to see that the founders of ‘Sippin’ died from that oil ... smh
1994 2018-01-20 18:52:09 Have you seen how much tax revenue has been generated from oil recently?
1995 2018-01-20 18:52:04 Finito es el tiempo que tiene el mago para concretar sus proyectos con Vista Oil & Gas: la SPAC le dura 24 meses, después la plata vuelve de Londres a los inversores.

2000 2018-01-20 18:51:27 Just a heads up to those of you interested in throwing your own events. 

Negotiating event space final pricing is like trying to catch an eel in in a pool of oil while wearing boxing gloves. 

Pro-tip always negotiate with multiple at once to prevent wasting time if one fails.
2001 2018-01-20 18:51:25 Since oil f.c was founded how many more trophies have city won compared to United again?

2009 2018-01-20 18:50:44 Our problem in Nigeria is that for many years we've lacked leaders with foresight, who have no plans for the future. That's why even though we switched to oil, we didn't envisage demand vis-a-vis our population growth, which explains why today we still need to import.
2010 2018-01-20 18:50:35 Idk what dealership you at it only took them a hour to wash my car change the oil and fix a crack in my window 
2011 2018-01-20 18:50:35 #MCINEW “Newcastle’s defensive style is killing the game”. Yes, because we we all have the financial backing of an oil rich middle eastern country. It is not an equal playing field.
2012 2018-01-20 18:50:26 Cool, and fun day. First, @pepboysauto doesn't do the tire rotation on my car with the oil change, so I sit around for 2 hours for just an oil change. Rotation is still listed on my receipt. Nice. 

Then find out my new insurance doesn't cover my Humalog.

Fuck today.

2015 2018-01-20 18:49:12 Here's the thing, @woot -- if I'm going to spend $30 - $60 on vinegar or cheese, or oil, or beef jerky or WTF ever, I want to pick what it is. I emphatically do not want a variety pack

2020 2018-01-20 18:48:52 Y'all better stay hydrated, get you some Zicam swabs (100% natural and effective), take your oregano oil, and rest. This flu epidemic is honestly FRIGHTENING
2021 2018-01-20 18:48:45 Beard oil is probably the best thing ever, shit makes my facial hair soft and healthy
2022 2018-01-20 18:48:10 This morning, my dad took my car for an oil change, washed it, vacuumed it, and wiped the interior down. He’s a prime example of how men should treat the women in their lives.
2023 2018-01-20 18:47:38 Water and oil will never mix
2024 2018-01-20 18:47:34 Sitting here drenched in oil (hot oil hair treatments get messy) and I knew exactly where Will’s eyes would go.... straight to the oily boob area
2025 2018-01-20 18:47:28 They did us dry over a barrel with no oil, half of them in current/new NEC, we have to buy more oil
2026 2018-01-20 18:47:15 Waiting to get an oil change who wants to chill/smoke w me ?
2027 2018-01-20 18:47:09 Yeah it’s literally just chickpeas lemon n olive oil basically
2028 2018-01-20 18:47:09 Your oil fields? you know it’s for the south south? Then leave it for them now
2029 2018-01-20 18:47:07 I don't know if it's available in Europe but have you tried CBD oil?  It works for my chronic pain (2 back surgeries) and even helped my depression.  It's made from hemp and the brand I use doesn't have THC in it.
2030 2018-01-20 18:46:56 @Saccone4PA18 thinks Poll Watchers are a way to ensure a fair election process while he fights for the status quo of gerrymandered district maps & tries to suppress our Right to Vote. Thank you for service, but it time for you to go work as a oil & gas lobbyist. #VoteThemOut

2037 2018-01-20 18:45:34 Bcoz even after having all that Oil money they could only buy "poor man's Ozil".
2038 2018-01-20 18:45:25 I don’t even use that for their faces like that because I don’t use it on my face. When it looked like his skin was dry hrs after using coconut oil I used it for two days. So I suspect it to be honest
2039 2018-01-20 18:45:25 Awww, so adorable. I'm wishing him a very very happy birthday.
2040 2018-01-20 18:45:22 Has anyone tried CBD oil ?

2042 2018-01-20 18:45:12 double cleansing is such a CHORE i hate washing my face with oil i never feel like it completely washes off
2043 2018-01-20 18:45:09 some oil ass subway might have to be the wave today 
2044 2018-01-20 18:44:47 Rememer Rosie called trump a snake oil salesmen she knew

2045 2018-01-20 18:44:35 Great win today, Conte keeping Barkley on the beach sends clear signal he wasn’t his signing. Let’s hope he plays in Semi Final. #CFCFamily #KTBFFH #BHACHE
2046 2018-01-20 18:44:31 America had direct interest in oil for that one , but here there is just zero interest for them, if they really wanted to get involved they would have sent troops , but all they did was set up camps in turkey to train soldiers for the rebels and send money for weapons
2047 2018-01-20 18:44:22 Our household uses CBD oil. Helps insomnia. Improved appetite for my picky eater kid. Improved social comfort/ reduced anxiety for my Aspie.

2052 2018-01-20 18:43:19 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
2053 2018-01-20 18:43:19 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
2054 2018-01-20 18:43:18 why do the demon rats whine so much about offshore oil drilling dont they care about the OIL TROOPS
2055 2018-01-20 18:42:57 1. I love seeing what other women are using. Yes to double cleansing with SPF
2. I really want to try Bite Agave Lip Mask

2056 2018-01-20 18:42:20 2hr wait to get an oil change... IM DYING
2057 2018-01-20 18:42:18 I want to know why we always have troops all over the planet? 
Why is everybody's business our business?
Why do our sons & daughters have to go to Kuwait? Who owns the oil fields & equipment there? 
Americans are really tired of throwin our kids on the fire to protect the rich
2058 2018-01-20 18:41:53 I used to be all about the latest technology. Anymore I long for the old days. However it’s still amazing I can set up a hot spot from my phone and work on my laptop fixing Work problems while sitting in the car getting an oil change this morning
2059 2018-01-20 18:41:50 Last I checked, it’s republicans who want to drill for every ounce of oil and gas regardless of the short and long-term impacts to the environment and human health. But sure, feel free to argue that this isn’t a partisan issue.
2060 2018-01-20 18:41:49 Now I just gotta start learning how to play around with what little hair I have hehe. I suck at these kinda shit. And I hate putting products or exposing my hair to heat. Just shampoo, condition and hair oil at my ends & I’m out the door.
2061 2018-01-20 18:41:43 "excellent at Telkom"? That is like putting fire and oil in one sentence, it is a combustible lie; Poor #Eskom. #SouthAfrica is under a complete illusion if we celebrate these parastatals that suck our country dry like vampires.

2066 2018-01-20 18:41:10 What most don’t understand is that Qatar’s wealth comes from natural gas, not oil. Tremendous drama currently underway between Saudi’s Arabia and Qatar. Things are not always as they seem. #METal-Intl

2075 2018-01-20 18:40:02 It should go cleanse > tone > aha > bha > serum > moisturizer > oil/occlusive (night time)
2076 2018-01-20 18:39:37 I'm having some coconut oil truffles instead of making breakfast because the kitchen is dirty and it's stressing me out.
2077 2018-01-20 18:39:35 Niggas talking bout stop sipping oil like they sipping real shit  boy you niggas are funny
2078 2018-01-20 18:39:32 Isn't that how communist street agitators work anyway?
2079 2018-01-20 18:39:19 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
2080 2018-01-20 18:39:00 Probably paying more than I need to for this oil change bc I literally know 0 things about my car and panicked and just said sure to whatever the guy was saying.
2081 2018-01-20 18:38:52 . @One_Angry_Chef have you looked into these cannabis oil claims? Particularly re: cancer and claims of it being a cure. Of course it's all anecdotal (live your paragraph in the paleo section on p100-ish). Nothing peer-reviewed as far as I've seen. Not to say its not of interest
2082 2018-01-20 18:38:35 i have nail oil coming my way and i can't wait 
my nails are gonna grow so strong and so flexible and maybe they'll stop shattering so they can get just short of unmangeably long

2089 2018-01-20 18:37:49 Wow. Bon appetit, ma belle! 
For me, at the aperitif... toasted Camembert on bread/toast with a "touch" of olive oil ... of course!   #NationalCheeseLoversDay (Sorry for my pitiful english but it's difficult to name a recipe) 
2090 2018-01-20 18:37:33 OUCH! Not a good testimony for #USA -- a @whiteHouse @potus who cannot stick to the terms. Hmmmm. We need to remember other pressing matters too, like #DakotaPipeLine recent oil spill affecting H20!
2091 2018-01-20 18:37:32 i, think oil in the drum is worth more than oil shiped in the barre. It's why we imbargo countries, and force them to-
2092 2018-01-20 18:37:32 This dude is so shiny and oily ....... when he goes to Dubai, the oil price will drop by $10 a barrel.  He's so oily, the USA will invade him shortly.
2093 2018-01-20 18:37:30 So apparently I was supposed to get an oil change 1000 miles ago...whoops 
2094 2018-01-20 18:37:21 i hate when i gotta get my oil changed. like y’all can’t come to me??? i can get tree delivered but not my oil changed in the parking lot 
2095 2018-01-20 18:37:06 Oil change and a clean car??? I’ll take it 
2096 2018-01-20 18:36:57 I see her dancing on the dance floor... I walk up looking at the back of her head and then she turns around... I just happened to have some anointing oil in my pocket so I quickly grabbed it out do the sign of the cross on her and the smoke starts flying
2097 2018-01-20 18:36:55 Beard oil is something to invest in to cuz helps a lot in taming and making your beard look straight
2098 2018-01-20 18:36:44 You're just sad that the snakes oil salesmen.. didn't make it.. if you hate Trump so much. Then tell him you wish to pay more taxes.....That you don't want a refund or a break at allllll..
2099 2018-01-20 18:36:26 Know when you're cookin up some bacon for breakfast and you start to get smells of that sweet meat cookin up, so you lean in closer for a whiff and that shit pops hot oil right in ya face? I like to think that's pig ghosts gettin ya from the afterlife
2100 2018-01-20 18:36:24 The bottom line for this hockey club is, if Talbot plays mediocre, the Oil are gonna lose.
2101 2018-01-20 18:36:14 Shoveled a path from my driveway to my oil tank in the backyard, and then through to my woodshed. I need to start accepting resumes for a husband.
2102 2018-01-20 18:36:13 It’s been over an hour that we’ve been here still waiting for an oil change. #ColtonIssues – bij Vandergriff Toyota
2103 2018-01-20 18:36:04 Tillerson has no foreign policy experience. He is tied in with the oil men.
2104 2018-01-20 18:36:01 I am very impressed by this. Not the effete helplessness, but the doing. I wish I lived nearer. I would bake you many cookies in exchange for an oil change (if, you know, you were up for that sort of thing).
2105 2018-01-20 18:36:00 Really stupid. You're right. It is as stupid as someone denying temperatures have increased 2 degrees Fahrenheit; 16 of 17 hottest years have been since 2000; and CO2 atmospheric concentration has increased from 280-410 ppm. Folks who do that are living caricatures too.
2106 2018-01-20 18:35:59 This barber put some type of lavender oil in my beard and I keep shaking my head to smell it 
2107 2018-01-20 18:35:58 Like oil on water ya heardd
2108 2018-01-20 18:35:52 Oil
2109 2018-01-20 18:35:48 ก็ว่าจะนอนเร็วตั้งแต่ก่อนเที่ยงคืนละ ไปๆมาๆตี1ครึ่งละ...
2110 2018-01-20 18:35:44 Billions??? Investors open a bank! But after independence Scotland will have oil as spare change, you know the stuff that feeds 65billion but is a burden to 5million
2111 2018-01-20 18:35:38 And what does Lac Megantic have to do with this story? The oil in that train was Bakken sweet light crude, "natural gasoline" as one source described it to me. As in, the furthest thing from dilbit or railbit.
2112 2018-01-20 18:35:20 I agree. It's rather amazing when you look how fast the economy took off by keeping 2 major promises, the tax cut and removing the Obama regulations.  In two years we will be the no. 1 exporter of oil.....

2115 2018-01-20 18:35:02 What's the price of oil today compared to 3 1/2 years ago?
What is a gallon of gas compared to 3 years ago?
2116 2018-01-20 18:34:52 Takes fossil fuel to mine, make & deliver windmills & solar panels. And "No" they don't get all their consumer-ready power from green energy
2117 2018-01-20 18:34:30 Time at the dealership. Oil change, new headlight, tire rotation and time for a nap. If they only had wine .
2118 2018-01-20 18:34:16 Then why was ISIL selling oil to the ZIonists? For profits? I thought ISIL hated Israel?

Do the research. And im not antisemetic, ,thats just bullcrop to stop people critisizng a real and heinous country into war profiteering, fascism and trickle down economics.
2119 2018-01-20 18:34:07 I asked an employee what to do w dry skin she said buy tartes maracuja oil. I asked another she said buy dermologica exfoliant & active moist. A month later I asked another she told me never exfoliate dry skin, use Clinique moisture surge. im out $100. My face is drier than ever.
2120 2018-01-20 18:34:02 พวกที่แต่งงานกันตั้งแต่ยังเรียนไม่จบนี่เค้ารู้สึกยังไงกันอ่ะ แบบความรู้สึกที่พร้อมจะสร้างครอบครัวจริงจังตั้งแต่อายุแค่นี้ นี่รู้สึกดีจังเวลาเห็นอะไรแบบนี้ที่เขาไม่กังวลอะไรแล้ว รู้แล้วว่าคนนี้คือคนที่ใช่ที่จะอยู่ไปด้วยกันตลอดชีวิต อิ่มเอมจัง นี่ยังรู้สึกไกลตัวมากๆอยู่เลยอ่ะ
2121 2018-01-20 18:33:55 I need oil in my car asap. 
2122 2018-01-20 18:33:55 Nope
@narendramodi hasn't failed in Energy Security Policy including Oil Pricing..It's the Communication that he has messed up big time on this..Prima facie Oil Pricing Policy may look insensitive but there is a method to this madness with a sound economic & social rationale..
2123 2018-01-20 18:33:49 A nigga that drank oil but got no problem staying hard
2124 2018-01-20 18:33:47 No, sunflower oil as am veggie. I some of them - still alive :-)
2125 2018-01-20 18:33:24 Hmmmmm. How do you handle the slow drying aspect of oil paints when you do your plein airs? Thin layers with medium? My colors always seem to get a little muddy is single sessions bc everything is too wet.
2126 2018-01-20 18:33:15 This is exactly what you wanted. His ratings with the military suck so shifting blame with this impossible budget is just another snake oil salesman trick. We see you.
2127 2018-01-20 18:32:47 Dunno why he really likes to work at midnight!! All things need to be done asap..it seems like I gotta burn my midnight oil...
2128 2018-01-20 18:32:39 Castor Oil!! You can get it from Sally’s, and I would recommend doing a castor oil and honey mask to your hair at least twice a week for 30min- and hour 
2129 2018-01-20 18:32:30 Jerms game  oil changed  wedding clothes nails and hair still working on ! Busy day

2131 2018-01-20 18:32:25 I just want to sleep after a long week of school and work :/ but I have to go wash my car and change the oil
2132 2018-01-20 18:32:10 By biggest advice to any #writer is 'research as you go'

writing something but you're unsure what something may be? Maybe what are the ranks in the army? What's the chemical composition of oil? anything! 

Google it and WRITE IT DOWN
2133 2018-01-20 18:32:02 Give him a little slack, he doesn't have enough fingers and toes to count to 60.
2134 2018-01-20 18:31:52 The sawdust/PVA just dries a lot darker than the slivers after you oil it... I swear, this is just about the most airtight timber floor you will ever see in your life :)
2135 2018-01-20 18:31:50 Dont trust someone that says drinking water won’t give you clear skin or someone who tells you to put cocnut oil on your face they lyin
2136 2018-01-20 18:31:27 Sir, Please take care of ONGC as well . It has been doing great service to the nation since 1956 through oil and gas production.
2137 2018-01-20 18:31:26 Finally got my damn oil changed
2138 2018-01-20 18:31:23 I fuck wit dat oil tuff. Dis shit wild
2139 2018-01-20 18:31:21 I was feeling awful so I put lavender oil in water hung over the radiator and got into bed with a cup of tea. It is MAGICAL. I won't lie, biscuits also helped enormously.
2140 2018-01-20 18:31:17 Como todo proceso de negociación hay que ir con propuestas serias, si el problema del agro es de hoy y el costo del estado quieren bajarlo desde el 85 sin poder hacerlo plantear eso no es de recibo. Si plantear una rebaja del gas oil o una rebaja de la ute, puede ser viable
2141 2018-01-20 18:30:57 yes poisoning ground water for the oil and gas industry is so much more noble than feeding people. you truly are clueless, which explains your line of work 
2142 2018-01-20 18:30:33 Low THC/high CBD cannabis oil is what you're looking for
2143 2018-01-20 18:30:28 Bila anak susah tidur. Amik towel lap semua badan. Tukar pampers. Sapu warm oil satu badan dia. Sambil tu urut urut kaki , tgn , belakang badan. Susukan . Now he sleeping like a baby. Mak? Pegang hp sambil minum air honey + lime. 
2144 2018-01-20 18:30:17 I only have tendinitis but cold packs really help as well as putting peppermint oil on it sometimes. Maybe that would help your arthritis? Hope you feel better soon fam!
2145 2018-01-20 18:29:14 This is a Good idea which means that each of the oil giants will establish refineries in each of the six geopolitical zones thereby creating employment and reducing fuel queues nationwide.
My fear  is this .will the beneficiaries of this current corrupt system allow it to work
2146 2018-01-20 18:29:08 Nothing tames a beard like regular use of beard oil

2148 2018-01-20 18:28:59 Lying trumpeter,  liar in chief.  That orange glow is snake oil he's made of.
2149 2018-01-20 18:28:50 I poured into an empty PEP Magnolia oil bottle (masks the strong smell) Rub it directly to my dark stretch marks before putting on my lotion. Mostly done once a day.
2150 2018-01-20 18:28:49 A dab of neat lavender essential oil, works a treat for sand fly and mozzie bites. 
2151 2018-01-20 18:28:41 This is about strategic control of Iraqi oil fields.
2152 2018-01-20 18:28:33 look at impact of sustainable practices on oil: the exponential growth of EVs are fast approaching the steep slope of the curve. Estimates are that by 2040 50% of new cars will have a plug. #METal-Intl
2153 2018-01-20 18:28:33 I can’t listen to him. Snake oil salesman

2155 2018-01-20 18:27:38 Basil oil’s got nothing on a sashimi chia smoothie
2156 2018-01-20 18:27:34 But it cures cancer, stops the down syndrome causing effects of vaccines, removes warts, protects freedom and can be used instead of oil in your car to the environment. Why would you fight it?
2157 2018-01-20 18:27:30 มันเหนื่อยนะ
2158 2018-01-20 18:27:28 I was too cheap to get my oil changed at jiffy lube after I got my other fluids checked so I planned to do it myself. But after I was driving off I realized I forgot i could have used the $13 off oil change coupon I had so I drive back and now they think I look like an idiot lol.
2159 2018-01-20 18:27:23 When is deadline @Berry_Chuwa
2160 2018-01-20 18:27:17 Oil Sands bitumen is Upgraded then refined. Sask & Alberta have had refineries 75 Yrs. Alberta & Sask have upgraders for 40 years. Sad you prefer to buy tanker oil from Saudi’s Sheiks & Venezuela’s dictator by tanker, & much worse polluters than oil sands
2161 2018-01-20 18:27:01 I used beard oil for the first time. I’m not sure how to feel about it??
2162 2018-01-20 18:26:58 ทำไมนี่ #CaiXuKun นางควีนวะ
ไม่รู้ดิแบบเคะ แซ่บๆอะ #IdolProducer
2163 2018-01-20 18:26:50 All is well that ends with an oil champi!
2164 2018-01-20 18:26:49 Went to get an oil change done on my car and now I'm waiting for them to replace my brakes and belts too.

4 hours of waiting because I can't get a ride home
2165 2018-01-20 18:26:46 Man listen I'm tired of this BS!!! What y'all have to day about your Government bombing the Middle East for nothing but oil and claiming
2166 2018-01-20 18:26:44 So many ways-small tax on foreign money wires, tax on oil exports to Mexico, drug cartel money. Same way NFL stadiums were built. Point is you build it and charge a small/fee to compensate. So many SIMPLE PAINLESS options
2167 2018-01-20 18:26:19 I just try to check my oil in my car to find out a damn chipmunk is storing acorns in the hood 
2168 2018-01-20 18:26:13 Purple Aki's Oil Painting Challenge? How much would he even charge to guest?
2169 2018-01-20 18:26:08 CBD oil. Google it

2173 2018-01-20 18:25:17 Slap it on immediately and it will stop anything but a 3rd degree burn in its tracks. Oil, steam, hot surface, doesn't matter.
2174 2018-01-20 18:25:10 Oil fire McLellan, Canucks hire him as Newell Brown replacement.
2175 2018-01-20 18:25:07 What Erdogan/Putin are doing in #Afrin is absolutly scandalous. The enemy is ISIS, not the Kurds. BTW does Erdogan continue to buy oil stolen by IS?
2176 2018-01-20 18:25:00 I had no say 26 yrs ago, and it still hurts to this day. Women may say it's their body, but it's also my child. Stay strong.
2177 2018-01-20 18:24:54 Everybody that know me know i don’t smoke i only sip oil
2178 2018-01-20 18:24:26 Itu emang segitu
Kan package yang oil isi 4 + rose water + mask

Kecuali yang oil isi 2 ama rose water cuma 145
2179 2018-01-20 18:24:16 It’s oil. Just more matte. Not glazed. Sort of like gouache. It’s on masonite.
2180 2018-01-20 18:24:15 Do you get the same feeling from the oil as you do from smoking it? If so, nope, made me feel like a zombie
2181 2018-01-20 18:24:05 Add one hundred pounds of olive oil and set timer for 3 minutes.
2182 2018-01-20 18:24:02 This is why it is better to compare gas with nuclear while taking into account future co2 price and predicted future gas price. Low oil prices should not be an excuse to emit more co2.
2183 2018-01-20 18:23:50 Lolz when you're in the express lane for an oil change and it takes 3 hours
2184 2018-01-20 18:23:49 Hopes he promises you new oil but gives you recycled oil.
2185 2018-01-20 18:23:28 Bae took my car to get an oil change and filled it up! #itsthethelittlethings
2186 2018-01-20 18:23:20 who got oil pens
2187 2018-01-20 18:23:17 Use baby oil or a skin oil before you put a lotion on that’s what I do!
2188 2018-01-20 18:23:13 Wait until you get to ruffle it. Mmmm feels like dead ends and oil or plastic
2189 2018-01-20 18:23:05 We don’t have gas here in this village. Old one was oil!
2190 2018-01-20 18:22:44 that oil will put a nigga in the grave but a nigga love sippin, rest up Fredo that was a real OG ass nigga.

2193 2018-01-20 18:22:36 Oh also grabbed an olive oil conditioning pack so I wasnt that mad...not in my bags...so I have the conditioner...no coconut oil or treatment to deep condition my hair 
2194 2018-01-20 18:22:35 Lol get a car and I’ll do the oil changes on it.
2195 2018-01-20 18:22:06 oil on canvas 
2196 2018-01-20 18:22:03 people who love the snake oil salesman iS TRyINg to EnSlAVe us!!1!?!
2197 2018-01-20 18:22:02 Oil spilt on my newest jeans. How's your Saturday so far?
2198 2018-01-20 18:21:58 When you deck the oil pan for extra HP
2199 2018-01-20 18:21:43 You do everything wrong for our nation. You are a snake  oil salesman. A con man. A grifter. Go back to making your sleazy real estate deals. America does not need or want you.
2200 2018-01-20 18:21:30 You need butter or a decent quality oil. Fresh ginger, turmeric, ground coriander, cumin, fenugreek, tin of chopped tomatoes, tomato purée, fresh coriander, chili powder or pepper, fresh garlic minced. Medium potato, onion, some cauliflower, rice, saffron (optional)
2201 2018-01-20 18:21:26 White Bread oil and vinegar Feta Cheese Pork Tomato Chickpeas Garlic
2202 2018-01-20 18:21:20  sounds like it...I had one in November, loaded up on clove oil & ibuprofen, could barely open jaw.  If still in pain on Monday- emergency dental appt..hope it goes quicker though.
2203 2018-01-20 18:21:15 Just make sure that you use the correct thinning solution based on what kind of paint it is, water based or oil based. That is the only important thing really.
2204 2018-01-20 18:21:09 So hilarious when you know the tax deals the tories have with the oil giants. I know a way to stop it. Who's in?
2205 2018-01-20 18:21:09 Getting my oil changed today, I go to Wal-Mart they tell me it’s going to be 4-5 hrs the wait I say No. I go to the Pennzoil  Rapid Lube on Asheville Highway no wait and I get my car taken care of right away. Also unlike the associates at Wally World they know what they are doing
2206 2018-01-20 18:21:03 Insane snake oil salesman your time is coming soon...
2207 2018-01-20 18:20:53 That oil ain’t where it’s at rn ..
2208 2018-01-20 18:20:53 Standard oil was only broken up in name, not in practice
2209 2018-01-20 18:20:44 Twitter is ruining my life I was getting an oil change and the mechanic looked at my car and said "she looks like she needs a bath" and I without thinking said "so does my toaster" and there was just an awkward dead silence in the waiting room
2210 2018-01-20 18:20:43 It’s been like an hour. Does oil changes take this long?
2211 2018-01-20 18:20:29 Just an FYI don't take an evening primrose oil supplement and a hormone pill together. I've just sobbed over what to have for dinner in the middle of Morrisons  #pcosproblems
2212 2018-01-20 18:20:26 .@BattleSpartanBB and @Toltonbball will face off at 7:55 p.m. tonight at Mizzou Arena in the MFA Oil/Break Time Shootout. I’ll have coverage of the 25-year event’s last ever game for @columbiatribune
2213 2018-01-20 18:20:16 I love my Audi but hate spending $90 for an oil change
2214 2018-01-20 18:20:10 恥ずかしくなってきたありがとう……そういうの好物（そういうの
2215 2018-01-20 18:19:55 Bulan ni beli yg perlu ja,  cleansing oil dh, eyebrow pencil pun dh,  tinggal sunscreen ja lagi
2216 2018-01-20 18:19:50 Interesting. I think the tendency for the batter and the oil to overwhelm the delicacy of the onions has been the issue in my experience. Less batter, more onion!
2217 2018-01-20 18:19:46 Lawd have mercy. Everyone’s getting their oil changed today. Glad I brought a book.
2218 2018-01-20 18:19:13 You can try products that are cream based and castor oil or jojoba oil are good oil alternatives
2219 2018-01-20 18:19:10 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
2220 2018-01-20 18:18:55 aku pake oil .-.

2222 2018-01-20 18:18:44 Finally getting my oil changed 
2223 2018-01-20 18:18:17 Working on my car today. Got both the CV axles in. Passenger side was not fun. Driver's side was a breeze. 

Now I have brakes and an oil change to do. Woo woo. 

Oh, and the passenger side ball joint needs replaced, but I do t have that yet.
2224 2018-01-20 18:18:02 coconut oil is the answer to everything
2225 2018-01-20 18:17:42 BS, Don. You are a liar. And, actually, you aren’t very good at it. Just like you aren’t very good at anything. You’re okay at self-promotion, but there’s really not much to promote. Just bluster and BS. Like any common snake oil salesman.
2226 2018-01-20 18:17:35 まじで………
2227 2018-01-20 18:17:33 The integrated entity will have capacity to neutralizing the impact of volatility of global crude oil prices.
2228 2018-01-20 18:17:19 Since when does an oil change cost $52??? Bullshit lol
2229 2018-01-20 18:17:05 ONGC is all set to become India's 1st vertically integrated  'oil major' company, having presence across the entire value chain.
The integrated entity will have advantage of having enhanced capacity to bear higher risks & take higher investment decisions in India & overseas.
2230 2018-01-20 18:17:01 Went to walmart for conditioner ans coconut oil...came out with all kinds of fucking tulle glitter and gift boxes and forgot the coconut oil...I got the conditioner though lol
2231 2018-01-20 18:17:00 But there is a nascent stage of development that hinges solely on the drive of entrepreneurship to establish the required momentum. The antitrust rulings which broke up large companies like Standard Oil and AT&T in the early and late 20th centuries respectively was required only

2239 2018-01-20 18:16:09 I'm making an omelette and ran out of olive oil so everything will be cooked in butter

I'm not afraid of calories
2240 2018-01-20 18:15:49 Aghr mere munh se oil nikala jaye tou ek paratha araam se ban jaye ga :/
2241 2018-01-20 18:15:48 Junior did his first oil change. Dat boy finally growing.
2242 2018-01-20 18:15:35 Yoooooo I lost all my coconut oil my life is in shambles
2243 2018-01-20 18:15:20 When the trees are gone & there’s no wood to burn,
When the wind will not blow & the mills won’t turn,
When the rivers freeze & the dams cannot churn,
Then people will need fossil fuels to burn,
The stark reality Progressives must face,
Coal & oil are good for the human race.
2244 2018-01-20 18:14:42 I’m at forte oil at 1st roundabout..the queue here is long af but they’re selling for now
2245 2018-01-20 18:14:39 When the trees are gone & there’s no wood to burn,

2246 2018-01-20 18:14:28 What will happen if our country raises their currency? We buy everything we need, the machinaries for the agriculture, the extra merchandise, oil and other resources that we lack. This way we'll get everything we need in much lesser price
2247 2018-01-20 18:14:18 Waking up the morning after saturating my face with Way Too Much argon oil and night cream feeling like a 5 year old again 
2248 2018-01-20 18:14:11 America First, just want US to pay for a wall and Mexico will pay back.  Sounds too much like Iraqi war will be paid by Iraqi Oil and then they claimed sovereignty.  TOO MUCH is coming out of taxpayers pockets.  Oh wait, you just cut taxes for Rich and Corps then shut down
2249 2018-01-20 18:14:04 Actually felt like working on school this morning. Finished an entire week, excluding replied to discussion posts, for one class. Peppermint essential oil is the key 
2250 2018-01-20 18:13:58 Ya smart move - data is the new oil and Apple just sourced a lot of it. C.120m active users with 20m uses per day! Think it will help Apple Music take off. Help build a better understanding of trends & What, when and how people are listening.
2251 2018-01-20 18:13:50 Ironically three cups of warm oil is what I had for breakfast. With just a few cups of mayo for added flavor.
2252 2018-01-20 18:13:46 I’m a bigger fan of US real estate -  Calgary is still too oil centric for me. Thanks anyways.
2253 2018-01-20 18:13:44 Theee best hair mask and add a bit of olive oil(10 drops)...
2254 2018-01-20 18:13:42 It's caused a few minor earthquakes. I'd rather not be dependent on ME oil where terrorists , sheiks, and whacko Islamic government control the flow of energy.
2255 2018-01-20 18:13:34 I'm a huge fan of Lush, though I have to be careful with their products because I'm allergic to citrus and they use a lot of sweet orange oil and grapefruit. Not surprised they make a good deodorant!
2256 2018-01-20 18:13:11 If you like a lot of sesame oil on your baklava, join our club!
2257 2018-01-20 18:13:11 I can imagine. The shale oil industry will be revitalized.

Shouldnt US have the responsibility and power to protect their allies from their own allies? Who betrayed whom?
2266 2018-01-20 18:12:25 2011 to 2014, the peak of the oil price, Canadian dollar was trading at 1.25 to a US dollar. It has gone south the minute the oil price took a nosedive.

2268 2018-01-20 18:12:07 They gave me the oil, but couldn't taste any garlic in it! Vegan spreads now very common so wouldn't be hard to do vegan garlic butter and would be most appreciated by the #vegan community please!
2269 2018-01-20 18:11:59 Stop dependence on foreign refined oil and petroleum products.  Support conversion to natural gas in industry, logging, and mining.  We don't need to drown a valley to liquify natural gas to send it overseas to a glutted market.  We can use it here to lower carbon use.  no #sitec

2294 2018-01-20 18:08:46 Heads up, most of these failed states had international based big oil, mining or agriculture corporations pilfering them. Most of these were attached top or bottom to well known US corporate names. The corporate  bribery & outright theft is how the peoples lost control.

2297 2018-01-20 18:08:37 but capitalist oil interests have moved in on venezuela and that hasn't stopped the shortages.
2298 2018-01-20 18:08:36 what is your estimated forecast for US Shale Oil Peak 12 or 15 mbpd ?. And when you expect this to occur. thanks in advance.
2299 2018-01-20 18:08:26 united nations is a joke..its already sold out to christain vatican and oil money

2303 2018-01-20 18:07:57 I suspect much-loathed oil companies spend a lot more money mitigating toxic residue of their business than Facebook does.
2304 2018-01-20 18:07:55 yo whoever said getting your oil changed is like 35 something dollars they fucking lied to me.. This shit is $67.99.. I STILL GOTTA PAY MY CAR NOTE & THATS $195.04
2305 2018-01-20 18:07:53 I can not live without Bio Oil.
2306 2018-01-20 18:07:48 It’s an aroma diffuser! Sends out diffused essential oil and has a mood light setting too. Mines on 24/7!!! Only like £15 on Amazon
2307 2018-01-20 18:07:32 We’ll see. If it continues to go up as predicted, then fracking will spike again as the next source of fuel for US. Meanwhile, north of the border in CAN, we wanted the oil price to go up as our economy relies on the abundance of fossil fuel which stalled when ME flooded supply.
2308 2018-01-20 18:07:29 As I say, laissez-faire capitalism worked splendidly 1870-1900. A Senator for the railroads, one for Standard Oil, one for U.S. Steel…Yeah, the good times are back again, all right.

2314 2018-01-20 18:06:31 Really glad you like it. We do have garlic oil available in our restaurants. Just ask next time you visit 
2315 2018-01-20 18:06:28 Like your slithering GOP goons driven by dirty money and lobbyist ever cared about America. What's up with sneaking a oil drilling provision with the tax bill? Make America polluted again.

Roll coal or something stupid and let the real American do their job.
2316 2018-01-20 18:06:25 Getting my oil changed, normally I despise this simple task, but today the place has a Disney marathon playing on their televisions. I’m pumped as heck.
2317 2018-01-20 18:06:19 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
2318 2018-01-20 18:06:10 Demonstrates your club is fake and bought yourself to the top with oil money. Dubai is a nice place and all but no point changing one team to another.
2319 2018-01-20 18:06:10 There is no bigger snake oil salesman in DC than #Sen. Schumer.
2320 2018-01-20 18:06:02 Erdogan always supported ISIS in Syria. Turkey was the major illegal conduit for Iraqi and Syrian oil sold on by ISIS. Erdogan also sent ISIS military materiel to fight the Kurds in western Syria.

2359 2018-01-20 17:59:52 US sold out Kurds so many times that Kurds became the second export product of USA after oil. OK this joke was even worse.
2360 2018-01-20 17:59:42 its 2004 again bitch
2361 2018-01-20 17:59:36 People today: HA! I can't believe in the old days that people were gullible enough to buy snake oil.

2366 2018-01-20 17:58:38 I hate skimpy ass hair. Get some castor oil.

2379 2018-01-20 17:55:30 Standard Oil was broken up.  Shameful and pathetic that companies like Amazon, which are every bit as dominant, are not broken up.  In fact, can't understand how they rationalize NOT breaking them up.

2385 2018-01-20 17:54:37 I’m left eye 100% with my Fuji (rangefinder). The screen always gets oil from my nose all over it. Boooooooo.

2390 2018-01-20 17:54:16 I’m so tired, stressed or stupid. Almost poured olive oil in my glass instead of red wine.
2391 2018-01-20 17:54:09 Totally agree. This is on the President and the majority party i.e., the Republicans. I’ll pass on the snake oil Mitch.

2395 2018-01-20 17:53:51 Oil in the bath may be good for the skin, but I’m thinking I should have picked the rosemary off before I threw this greasy chicken into the tub.
2396 2018-01-20 17:53:50 Read an article about oil diffusers this morning and I’m still undecided on which one to order. 
2397 2018-01-20 17:53:37 Yes you wash all the starches and flavors from the pasta when you rinse it. Just add oil after it’s cooked then put it on a flat tray and cool it down

2405 2018-01-20 17:52:10 Bakken api 43 between 200-350C has about 18%. It does have fuel oil and residue 
Eagle Ford Condensate 60 api has 3.5% and basically no fuel oil or residue.
So everything fits in in between
2406 2018-01-20 17:51:59 I would imagine every snake oil salesman kind of looked like Dworkin.

2433 2018-01-20 17:47:37 The Scottish ‘spending deficit’ is tied more to the global oil price than anything else. Given NHS block grant is ~£600 per person higher than rUK I don’t think it’s lack of funds. Issue is more about SNP being honest with electorate.

2453 2018-01-20 17:45:12 The corrupt politician is very smart so no agency can do anything to him. He is like a kabaddi player applying oil to his body so no player can catch him

2460 2018-01-20 17:44:25 Nothing like claiming to be a man of God while supporting the most ungodly president in recent history. He is selling that snake oil hard
2461 2018-01-20 17:44:24 It’s a very common thing on the m52. The cause is usually worn sealing rings, witch you don’t get at dealerships. They will try to sell you the whole vanos unit, cost = expensive D: the misfire of cyl 6 might be from worn sparkplug, or oil leak from the top gasket.

2463 2018-01-20 17:44:17 Put your oil in that water and it should solve that problem eh.  Smh.  Your as bright as your MPP you most likely voted for. Id ask what sense does your statement make but your one of those types that just hate because your told to. Like i said, sprinkle oil on your water problem
2464 2018-01-20 17:44:16 Horses for courses. For such a hyped up place I expected more than a bundle of oil. Paper shouldn’t go see-through in 5 mins. It was a no-track meal as well, so I’m super bitter!

2467 2018-01-20 17:43:58 When I moved to Grande Prairie in 2008 they were advertising 15/hr for Tim's cause they couldn't get anyone during the oil boom lol it's not impossible. I'll gladly pay a buck more for something if it helps others get paid.
2468 2018-01-20 17:43:48 just got an essential oil diffuser. only a few more hours until I achieve enlightenment here.
2469 2018-01-20 17:43:46 They can have the oil. If the future is alternative energy then what a superpower should be stockpiling is silver and metals to connect everything.
2470 2018-01-20 17:43:44 Norwegian typical idiocy. Oil made them weak minded

2485 2018-01-20 17:42:30 There is NO WAY the 60 million dolts who drank the snake oil like a case of Keystone Light and voted for this fraud don't believe in this fictional memo.  If they were told there was a photo of Schumer with a superfluous penis growing out of his forehead, they'd pre-order copies.

2502 2018-01-20 17:40:32 @realDonaldTrump Sign an executive order to change the MPG rates on combustion engines to minimum 50 MPG with incentives for higher more fuel-efficient cars. Heated vapor combustion engines have been proven to exceed 100 MPG. Save oil.

2512 2018-01-20 17:39:00 I came to get an oil change how you trying to get me to trade in my 2017 for a 2018. Sir. Sir. Sir.
2513 2018-01-20 17:38:57 Getting cash back and a discount on gas off this oil change
2514 2018-01-20 17:38:51 Recently found out I had another brother/sister. My mum aborted 35 years ago because she wasn't sure her husband (my dad) was the father. Mum has never told me - dad did. Says he will always carry guilt and sadness for letting it happen.  Huge admiration for you, Will. 
2515 2018-01-20 17:38:51 2個目に拳か槍作りたいのでまた行くしかないですね・・・これ
2516 2018-01-20 17:38:47 I'd also recommend peppermint oil behind the ears.  Sounds like voodoo, but it works.  You can also put it in your sinuses.  It's working for me.
2517 2018-01-20 17:38:38 Substitute unsweetened applesauce for oil when baking for great taste and #HealthyEating #olderwomen #over60. I made awesome brownies this way!

2520 2018-01-20 17:38:01 China wants peace on the peninsula.
DPRK wants oil & other contraband from China.
ROK wants good trade relations with China, by far and away its biggest export market/trade surplus.
ROK wants to avoid becoming an unintended casualty of a “bloody nose” strike by the US vs DPRK.
2521 2018-01-20 17:37:55 Can't say now but with US dominating the scene, prices can reach as high as $100 per barrel by this year end. Most of the oil is being produced by private companies in US so they will try to maximize their profits.
2522 2018-01-20 17:37:54 My favorite oil at the moment is sacred mountain. Calming, grounding, relaxing. #YoungLiving #Rose #EssentialOil #win

2530 2018-01-20 17:36:50 So I just had berries for lunch. And a banana. Coffee. And fish oil.

Dieting sucks. But, I'd rather shock the **** out of my system before the travel starts ramping up.

Besides - those 5K & half marathons aren't going to run themselves in 2018.
2531 2018-01-20 17:36:50 This is a forward thinking mayor. Hold those companies accountable like big asbestos, big tobacco and now big oil. They've made money on the backs of the communities across the globe. They have much blood on whir hands. They care not the impact their greed has on the world.
2532 2018-01-20 17:36:45 Oil change dates. They’re a thing 
2533 2018-01-20 17:36:44 He hasn’t stopped being a dick 
2534 2018-01-20 17:36:27 I’ve been at the mechanic getting an oil change a little over 30 minutes and three boomers have already angrily complained about having to wait “almost an hour” to get there car fixed. Pathetic
2535 2018-01-20 17:36:24 次に備えて金剛ぶち込んだけどこの要求量は・・・
2536 2018-01-20 17:36:17 Throw some oil in their water supply and that sould fix that problem most ricky tick.  Right?

2541 2018-01-20 17:35:48 I was getting my oil change and had two hours to kill. So I figured I check out to see if Too Cool had any model kits I'd be interested in building today, but noooooope
2542 2018-01-20 17:35:48 What ever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.

So you can fight for oil!
2543 2018-01-20 17:35:40 Thats why I SAY  they are anti-nationals .They use FORCE ,JIHAD to occupy HINDUs created in INDIA by minority status or by begging(pakis beg)  or violence. Tell me what muslims have achieved,they plunder natural resources &breed. ex OIL in Saudi Arabia, Eating cows in INDIA.
2544 2018-01-20 17:35:38 No, just White, divided, hated, and laughed out.  This carnival act circus clown snake oil salesman and charlatan. Bigliest buffoon ever

2546 2018-01-20 17:35:32 The combined market value of ONGC and HPCL is Rs 311,925 crore, or $49 billion. Through this acquisition, #ONGC will become India's first vertically integrated 'oil major' company, having presence across the entire value chain. Congrats @dpradhanbjp
2547 2018-01-20 17:35:31 Bella spoiled af today  my car is cleaned, vacuumed, oil changed, tags on, and lastly full tank of gas! 
2548 2018-01-20 17:35:16 The amount of anxiety I get pulling into the tire track things to get my oil changed is tremendous.. like what if I miss and kill the guy standing underneath or just absolutely total my car
2549 2018-01-20 17:35:04 Tea tree oil is my holy grail
2550 2018-01-20 17:34:54 not as bad as what Trump is doing to the environment...not even CLOSE..Paper deteriorates...his policies will live with us forever...like oil!
2551 2018-01-20 17:34:44 Coconut oil really dried Eriife's skin out and it was then I read that it doesn't work as moisturiser for every skin type. I thought raw shea butter would be better but so far, it isn't
2552 2018-01-20 17:34:31 ugh can't wait to get some supplies wanna try out watercolor soon I do oil paintings now
2553 2018-01-20 17:34:16 Said it before, I’ll say it again; if they don’t like oil and gas, let’s shut them off. I have ZERO problem with that. 
When they decide they really do need it and want it back, the price just doubled. That’s called free market economy.
2554 2018-01-20 17:34:16 Going to get this oil change done 
2555 2018-01-20 17:34:12 이제야 아셧서요 ? 저 오일님 사랑둥이 짅영이 짜장면 먹는거 보면서 저녁밥 먹은걸루 치는대 !!!!

2563 2018-01-20 17:33:15 But CBD oil is helping me tremendously and I use Epsom soaks, CBD rubs, a TENS unit, self heating braces and wraps, foods, spices, vitamins...I have no choice than to seek alternative methods for relief. I want to live my best life! 
2564 2018-01-20 17:33:15 Ahah I didn't mean coconut oil for removing it just as an example.
The coconut oil is for conditioning
2565 2018-01-20 17:33:13 @NBCSports. Haha haha listening to you'll talk about City being upset Manchester United spent money they earned through revenue as outrageous bc City didn't get money from their oil sugar daddy!

2567 2018-01-20 17:32:45 There’s no “I” in teamwork.

Any plastic-to-oil scenario will be a regional team effort by both municipal and private concerns.

You push on and push off, who are you to tell us what to do?

No response required, thanks!

2572 2018-01-20 17:32:08 Haha!  I’m hoping I didn’t crack any but I ain’t going to the doctor for them to tell me I did cause there is nothing to make it heal faster except time and maybe some CBD oil
2573 2018-01-20 17:31:38 @AjazkhanActor To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it. #IStandWithAjazKhan
2574 2018-01-20 17:31:36 Coconut oil levels running low and I haven’t seen a Walgreens sale for Shea Moisture products since we really started using it 
2575 2018-01-20 17:31:34 But the PCs support the oil and gas sector.  Funny how NDP hates it and wants to do away with it and when it lifts the economy, they love it.

2640 2018-01-20 17:23:24 A Wyoming senator has sponsored a bill that allows states better regulatory control of oil and gas development on federal lands.

2645 2018-01-20 17:22:37 I feel as if he would condemn most technologies because it has pushed things like a faster urbanization rate and utilizes, even abuses, parts of nature (like drilling for oil). As he is not a conservationist he would not appreciate even the technologies that help the environment

Will also depend on the hedge funds who usually over buy a commodity like oil, particularly now that it is riding a northward pricing direction.

The big question, how long will this stay at that price?

2763 2018-01-20 17:06:34 I am so sick of this!! Why are some ppl ok with the wholesale slaughter of birds and bats by these monstrosities! Yet, if a few birds get oil on them they lose their shiznit!!
2764 2018-01-20 17:06:23 I haven’t had a navel piercing get infected, but for other piercings I swear by tea tree oil:
I get pure tea tree oil and combine it in a small container with another oil (ie grapeseed, argan, olive) as pure tea tree can irritate skin. Then I dab it on the area with a swab (1/2)
2765 2018-01-20 17:06:13 Instead of oil and vinegar.... how about oil OR vinegar!!!!
2766 2018-01-20 17:06:04 I asked for salad dressing and they just gave me olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
2767 2018-01-20 17:06:02 Need someone to take me to work today , while Bella gets her oil changed
2768 2018-01-20 17:05:56 Endorse. Eggs cooked in olive oil are the best. My grandmother, from a shithole country, taught me that.
2769 2018-01-20 17:05:42 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!

2872 2018-01-20 16:54:00 My homie did an oil painting towards the end of our trip and continued it the next day. Gotta see if he still has it
2873 2018-01-20 16:53:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
2874 2018-01-20 16:53:53 Update it was $80 and its because I need synthetic oil for my car
2875 2018-01-20 16:53:35 You need a focus point Maybe a vase with red roses or outstanding color flowers... but it is nice
2876 2018-01-20 16:53:31 Chi and the Communists are about to launch a strike somewhere-possibly in the South China Sea at the Paracel Islands possibly under the guise of protecting fishing vessels, but to grab oil and natural gas deposits.
2877 2018-01-20 16:53:26 





2878 2018-01-20 16:53:24 I didn't ask for a fight but it sure sounds like you want one. Pick someone else. I'm out.
2879 2018-01-20 16:53:08 A headband?? 
2880 2018-01-20 16:53:06 and of course, that only scratches the surface. much of the direct collapse of these states can be seen to be clear legacies of many western meddlings. the support of israel, divide and conquer during colonial rule & the cold war, keeping an iron grip on oil supplies by any means
2881 2018-01-20 16:52:59 Accounting test tomorrow and I have yet to start need to meet my marketing group to touch up on our project before it’s submission deadline which is also tomorrow what’s more I did not do my OB tutorial when I know i’m gonna present next gotta burn the midnight oil man
2882 2018-01-20 16:52:51 #BastilleConspiracy Oil on Water is actually based on #AudreyHorne? #wildworld @bastilledan
2883 2018-01-20 16:52:42 I Always feel like I’m being robbed when I’m getting a oil change. Back to leasing soon, car ownership is silly.
2884 2018-01-20 16:52:40 I didn't like the smell on the first load, so tried essential oil and still didn't like it. some ecover fabric conditioner in last load and I'm happy. sure I'm just conditioned to a certain smell of washing and will get better at this! Good to see you in the Guardian this week.

2886 2018-01-20 16:52:35 Some people act like CBD Oil is the second coming, others act like I’m trying to sell them crystal meth
2887 2018-01-20 16:52:30 So on nights where I use it I just take my makeup off as usual and then put this on my clean skin and don’t put any moisturiser or oil on
2888 2018-01-20 16:52:29 Joking aside, there is NO way nuclear can take over suddenly. Electricity generation, IMO, should be shared mostly between gas and nuclear. Transportation mostly by oil & gas. If we could displace coal and biomass, it would be a step forward. 
2889 2018-01-20 16:52:25 and then tea tree oil to spot treat acne at night works really really well, it dries it right up for me! a lot goes a long way:) another thing is that u MUST wash ur face every night before bed or it won’t work  I don’t have perfect skin but I thought i’d share what works4 me:)
2890 2018-01-20 16:52:18 Wrong, depend what oil you have syn or conv, syn go by miles 3-4k conv change every 3 months regardless the mileage or ev 3k depends what comes first, conv gets shitty overtime even if the car sittin
2891 2018-01-20 16:52:12 Aw, I didn't get one! Now I feel so excluded. This is almost as bad as that one time half of Twitter got blocked by @sweden, but I didn't.

I feel so sad
2894 2018-01-20 16:51:59 80 Years of Oil money has turned a dying Islam into a global menace. 
It may take the world 200 years to recover from this danger.

2896 2018-01-20 16:51:51 Sea salt o tea tree oil es lo mejor para eso. Si usas sea salt mezclalo con agua caliente y metes la nariz y lo dejas un rato ahi. Antes de acostarte mezcla sea salt con un poco de agua y te lo untas en el area. Y se te va rápido.
2897 2018-01-20 16:51:49 รู้สึกไม่ค่อยดีสักเท่าไหร่
2898 2018-01-20 16:51:38 This CBD oil is the shit. I for real haven't had a cigarette craving for 2 days now. Plus I slept like a baby last night. Fuuuuuck big tobacco, cannabis is taking over.
2899 2018-01-20 16:51:35 Literally all I need is my oil changed but everywhere in franklin has a four hour wait time because southerners like to cancel everything in their life over a couple inches of fucking snow

2902 2018-01-20 16:51:13 365 days ago, I got my oil changed and watched Fox News morning coverage of the inauguration. I then went to the gym and fell off the treadmill listening to the commentary. At noon, I was with 3s and 4s who give me hope for our future. #OneYearInOffice
2903 2018-01-20 16:50:53 I've had this oil change schedule for two weeks and these folks playing. Today is not the day.

2907 2018-01-20 16:49:54 As did I...may have to recreate that. But an olive oil cake is on the cards tomorrow
2908 2018-01-20 16:49:49 Lol trying to get oil in Ark and ive lagged out about 6 times already and i havent even left my base. What a joke.
2909 2018-01-20 16:49:43 @AishaYesufu We have enormous oil, our population size is mind blowing, talents everywhere but somehow, the "leaders" we've been having have not being able to use all these to our advancement. 2019 they will all be swapped with progressive thinkers. Simple! #RedefineNigeria

2911 2018-01-20 16:49:32 Men and boys ground into dust of battlefields and a film star comes along to tell fleeing 'refugees', many of whom hate the west for grabbing their oil, are astounded by this kind, very rich, empowered and independant woman, it's OK to be a poor refugee. Honestly.
2912 2018-01-20 16:49:26 Drove an hour for a free oil change...oil change was full price
2913 2018-01-20 16:49:20 +like oil gets slowly absorbed by a piece of cloth...and you know then, it's hard to get oil out from that cloth
2914 2018-01-20 16:49:04 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…

2916 2018-01-20 16:48:45 Ahhhhh. Oregano oil helps keep colds and flu at bay. I included ACV on my own for metabolism purposes and to help with flushing me out.
2917 2018-01-20 16:48:39 has any real ppl used castor oil/fenugreek seeds and seen real results or is that the just the internet telling me stuff
2918 2018-01-20 16:48:38 It depends on what part but majority of mobile home parks on that side of Carson are there bc the land is toxic. Oil wells or a dump 
2919 2018-01-20 16:48:34 Anyone ever take their car to @Midas for an oil change and not discovered it's a death trap that will kill their whole family at any minute?

2924 2018-01-20 16:47:08 Does anyone know how I can get hold of medical use Marianna oil for cancer treatment. It’s for a friend. Inbox only.
2925 2018-01-20 16:47:07 I always add a little butter & olive oil to my cooked pasta too. Your pantry pasta looks delish

2929 2018-01-20 16:46:49 ok but idk if you can use olive oil bc it will taste like olive so it should be a taste neutral oil? however you say that haha or one which taste you don't mind in the cookie, olive oil is more for nonsweet stuff

2934 2018-01-20 16:45:59 momentum is clearly on the upswing here, but every sustained dollar higher, brings on more supply and hedges, at one point, it will be another spectacular short, I'm thinking $73 or $87 brent, is a short (of course some of the oil strength is merely dollar weakness)
2935 2018-01-20 16:45:38 but the toryies told scots the oil was running out what twisted people the tories are so are you going to get more money for scotland or do as you are told by WM
2936 2018-01-20 16:45:29 I never was interested in sipping oil , shit ain’t for me 
2937 2018-01-20 16:45:25 if you dab the oil off of your pizza, you are not worthy of eating pizza!!!! Don’t @ me
2938 2018-01-20 16:45:18 You ain't said nothing to slick to a can of oil
2939 2018-01-20 16:45:00 AUO……お前いいやつだな……
2940 2018-01-20 16:44:58 Wasn’t the oil running out during the indyref?  Liars.
2941 2018-01-20 16:44:55 Shea butter might be fake.. ndo. Try coconut oil instead?
2942 2018-01-20 16:44:53 I don't get why either did not settle for cannabis oil. The only precaution to make is to watch blood pressure.
2943 2018-01-20 16:44:40 I got on my phone this morning to google the benefits of salmon oil pills & ended up on Twitter subtweeting 5 times.
2944 2018-01-20 16:44:32 But the amount of oil it has though lol

2950 2018-01-20 16:43:48 Math is hard. That oil job you're waiting for isn't coming back. They're lying to you if they say it will. Choose the rest of the economy that is doing well. Good luck.
2951 2018-01-20 16:43:18 Tonight isn't a match, it's a farce. They have a the oil wealth of a sovereign state, we have an austerity obsessed jerk who sells the odd sport shoe. It's a non-contest. Best League in the world? No, non, nein
2952 2018-01-20 16:43:15 พลาดอะไรไปเยอะเลย เซ็ง
2953 2018-01-20 16:43:14 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
2954 2018-01-20 16:43:11 but I'd love to try, both with acrylics or oil (to find which one i can deal better with), because I love the smooth texture, unlike the canvas one. I'm only worried about the need of primer or gesso or something, so that the wood won't absorb the paint or get soaked or distorted

2959 2018-01-20 16:42:35 Not talking to myself today for making an irrational decision 2 days ago to schedule an oil change appt for 11am. My punishment will be going home immediately after & getting back into my prison bed. I think I’ll make myself stay there the rest of the night.
2960 2018-01-20 16:42:14 아 오일님 아 저 그렇게 말을 해버리시면 제가 설래서 눈물이 나오 잖아요 아 ㅠㅠㅠ
2961 2018-01-20 16:42:11 Turkey has supported Isis by buying their oil. Islamist Turkey is afraid of the kurds and that they would receive U.S. military support.

2970 2018-01-20 16:41:14 Getting a little obsessed with my #Frankincense oil. Got it for 8 quid
2971 2018-01-20 16:40:32 Gotta do an oil change soon. I’m on 22%  but i gotta wait for Chevy to call me to make the appointment
2972 2018-01-20 16:40:25 This is also because Modi could not manage rupee value. It diminished more than 10% despite the biggest import item Crude oil plunging by more than 50%, shows real failure of governance. Infact Govt is hiding all their failure behind the benefit got from damn low Crude oil price.
2973 2018-01-20 16:40:16 Try shampooing the hair with cooler water and massage your scal softly to reduce the amount of oil being produced #HairTips #Delaware #VirginHairObsession
2974 2018-01-20 16:40:10 In my opinioin, It won't be used as a daily transaction currency, but I think it will always have an effect on the crypto world. I view it as a high commodity, like gold or crude oil.

2988 2018-01-20 16:38:12 Yes.  We use a lot of natural remedies-just s general dislike for a variety of reasons of synthetics. One of the keys, to make it all work, is a correct and timely diagnosis-as in oil of oregano for colds, but in @apasztor82 case the diagnosis was something different.

It’s a decommissioned oil rig

3116 2018-01-20 16:21:23 Ah! I think we're in agreement. I think there are several things going on:

3. Early adopters/early majority wonder why ideas are being sold like snake oil

3155 2018-01-20 16:16:43 The Lapel bowlers struggled on the lanes today with the additional oil. Unfortunately none of our 3 girls will advance, but on the boys side Jaxon Fetty will advance to semi-state next week in Lafayette. Team play still today at 1pm

3157 2018-01-20 16:16:15 bc there's no oil in #Afrin
3158 2018-01-20 16:16:13 me right now smoking my oil.....
3159 2018-01-20 16:16:01 Yes! Look up carrier oils! Some essential oils can be too strong or irritate if you don’t mix, I even put lavender with coconut or shea oil and use it as lotion.
3160 2018-01-20 16:16:01 me, smothering my legs in coconut oil after rolling out of bed at 10:45 am: I am the MASTER of self care

3163 2018-01-20 16:15:29 I got one of these too.
3164 2018-01-20 16:15:15 Interesting  I might have to check them out. Which one do you use, the body oil?
3165 2018-01-20 16:15:14 What about them? Is the oil owned by private American companies? The USA does not need that oil, they probably doN't want regime to have that oil. In any case, the Kurds want to completely change that regime anyways.
3166 2018-01-20 16:15:05 You are correct. But for real politik in Asia and for logistic support Israel is important. But for oil, we can afford to bypass the Gulf. Palestine has been dear to us but they support Pak.See what happened to Bangladesh Hindus even after our support to Mukti Vahini.
Fanaticism.
3167 2018-01-20 16:15:02 Is peak venture funding sort of like peak oil - it's all downhill from here? ;)
3168 2018-01-20 16:14:58 @prakashraaj Sir, India's largest state owned Fortune 500 oil company still does not have any norms for posting Quality Control personnel at sensitive locations, even as adulteration remains a multi million rupee mafia in the country
3169 2018-01-20 16:14:51 the fact that you cant see Trump for what he is, a conman insecure inept snake oil salesman who was only trying to market Trump TV while winning a losing campaign, speaks wonders about your intellect and critical thinking skills. I welcome any encounter against yours in a battle
3170 2018-01-20 16:14:47 Oh me too! Went & had the oil & scrub done. Like $80 for both treatments. Came out feeling so good 
3171 2018-01-20 16:14:43 ...you’re convinced that he’s going to somehow trickle down his wealth on you! And Mexico is going to pay for  the wall, right? Is that how he’s trying to “fund the government?” Does his koolaid taste like prostitute piss or tanning oil? Asking for a friend.
3172 2018-01-20 16:14:37 Yummy-- recipe?
3173 2018-01-20 16:14:24 Oil, hot rag and tweezers!!!
3174 2018-01-20 16:14:19 Pan fry in olive oil, season with garlic salt or jus normal salt and garlic flakes. I usually dash them with balsamic vinegar
3175 2018-01-20 16:14:19 Somehow when I look in the mirror, I do not see a Bot but I did spend 2 years drilling oil wells in Russia, loved it too.

3178 2018-01-20 16:14:05 I guarantee that 90% of your problems will be fixed if you use coconut oil
3179 2018-01-20 16:13:56 ”Data is the new oil. It’s valuable, but if unrefined it cannot be used. It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so, must data be broken down, analyzed for it to have value.”- Clive Humbly
3180 2018-01-20 16:13:51 Anyone with chronic pain should consider/study Brags Apple Cider Vinegar and looking at your body's ph levels. Honey too unless you are allergic. Do you live in a State where you can get CBD oil?
3181 2018-01-20 16:13:44 I don't precook. Too complicated. 

Just sautee the rice in a teaspoon of each butter/ghee/olive oil combination. Sautee well, constantly moving. The aroma alone is worth the effort!! Cover with liquid to barely cover the top of rice, add salt. Boil, cover, turn heat to lowest
3182 2018-01-20 16:13:42 Need to go get a new tire. Go to Honda dealer for a part..... do an oil change and flush the radiator

3189 2018-01-20 16:13:03 My elderly mother can pay 4.00 for oxy but aphria total is over 200.  She got fed up and with 35.00 of product she produced an oil which works great.  Consumers will always find cheaper and better ways if the supplier can't keep up.  We don't wait in this day & age - we innovate.
3190 2018-01-20 16:13:03 Olive Oil? o.O
3191 2018-01-20 16:13:01 OIL EN NON DIEU
3192 2018-01-20 16:12:59 You got rid of all scientists proposing global warming & others quit in protest so your budget should be flush. Your bank account is getting bigger every day because of the kickbacks from big oil - I can see why you aren’t worried. Every day you hold your job is a worry for me

3197 2018-01-20 16:12:39 I figured 'Operation Olive Branch' was a clever double entendre referring to Afrin's economy being olive and olive oil based.

3201 2018-01-20 16:12:11 That sucks. I just put $600 into the Explorer to get it running again. I suspect it's been leaking oil for a while but it's really dripping now. Hopefully it's not one of the ultra-expensive repairs.

3212 2018-01-20 16:10:52 What if I told you every slice of pizza contains 640mg of sodium?  And a cup of oil?  And 16 cigarettes?  And a third of a gun and a 3% chance of stubbing your toe?  Still want that slice?  HMMMMMMMMMMM???!!

3223 2018-01-20 16:09:56 Awesome job! It looks like the kids had a lot of fun giving back.
3224 2018-01-20 16:09:49 getting an oil change and I forgot the most crucial item - HEADPHONES. only country music bumping in this joint 
3225 2018-01-20 16:09:49 Perhaps to position for a 1970's style oil crisis of US making by disrupting KSA Iran region oil output with a regional war and put China's economy through oil starvation. US sails thru crisis, inflates debts away, maintains hegemony. ?? Dunno. Just thinking out loud.

3253 2018-01-20 16:06:47 But you wouldn't have to do the whole thing in one go. You could break it up, with landing points and lifts to high points on oil rig type structures at sea

3283 2018-01-20 16:03:53 The GOP has been telling the world that corporate profits and oil are more important than American citizens, the health of the planet, and general decency for decades.

3301 2018-01-20 16:02:12 @LeithToyota I’d like to know why when you include car wash and oil service when buying a car from you my car never gets washed and an oil change takes 3 hours.

3303 2018-01-20 16:02:11 In 2013 you said (paraphrasing) any government shutdown is the President’s fault.  That problems start at the top.  But now it’s the dems fault? You’re a modern day snake oil salesman.
3304 2018-01-20 16:02:09 I LOVE U ELI
3305 2018-01-20 16:02:04 The guy changing my oil ask if I needed a drink or some snacks or if I wanted to play on their iPad ...
3306 2018-01-20 16:01:55 For this look? Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner, Africa’s best herbal oil, water, and eco styler 
3307 2018-01-20 16:01:12 I had a ‘99. It’s still running and driving to this day. Over 300k miles on it. Guy I sold it to bought it for his kid. Keep the oil changed in them and they’ll run forever.

3311 2018-01-20 16:00:46 The architect's image shows the bearings just above water as does your elevation. Putting a jacking shelf below water could encourage damage or collect debris and jacks would risk oil spillage. If the river level varies seasonally maybe ok.

3313 2018-01-20 16:00:09 Ah, Welsh transport funded by the EU? So why did the majority of Welsh voters vote to leave the EU? What do Wales need? Hmm, maybe a reliable export. We're not the Scots who sit on a load of North Sea oil!
3314 2018-01-20 16:00:03 Dehydrated Cavolo Nero Black Cabbage with Olive oil, Salt & Pepper. Oh my god its just like the best thing ever.
3315 2018-01-20 15:59:59 Lol that’s @Swazi_Swela come to me to pick up barrels of oil 
3316 2018-01-20 15:59:54 @realDonaldTrump is making a lot of 'firsts'.  Parent to parent, I'd like his advice on how he advises his son Barron on how to deal with porn stars.  Does he tell him to just grab them and kiss them or should he use snake oil salesmanship?
3317 2018-01-20 15:59:41 I crave for mang inasal's unli rice pati yung oil
3318 2018-01-20 15:59:31 Before that we'll impose honest oil production tax and credit rates.
3319 2018-01-20 15:59:27 so my class for tomorrow was cancelled, and i'm all fueled up after taking a 2-hour nap before sunset... i guess it's time to burn the midnight oil.
3320 2018-01-20 15:59:22 Was this statement made in KFC while eating roasted chicken and oil allover his mouth?
3321 2018-01-20 15:59:10 His "business skills" have led to failure more often than success. Those that voted for this man were conned. They are the same as those that were conned by "Snake oil" salesmen in the past. Simple souls incapable of deep thought. @realdonaldtrump
3322 2018-01-20 15:59:05 coconut oil does clog pores but ahaha u got the point!
3323 2018-01-20 15:58:58 Wow lol that's impressive!
3324 2018-01-20 15:58:51 #GovtShutdownFacts Hour 11. We amuse ourselves with absurd and impossible stories of elected officials. One such story spread around the oil canister fire was that of an official who paid a porn star to watch shark week with him. We then, as a society, missed shark week.
3325 2018-01-20 15:58:47 Anything else, check the air pressure, check the oil.

3329 2018-01-20 15:58:16 Took the car for an oil change and I about fainted at this $200 total
3330 2018-01-20 15:58:15 Right there with you, and we ran out of oil last night!
3331 2018-01-20 15:58:08 キッチンビートってこれかーーー！途中からみたことある！！楽しくていい
3332 2018-01-20 15:58:00 And yes if anybody's that stupid to think that America and here invaded Iraq because they/Britain thought they had weapon's of mass distruction must be fucking deluded! It was obviously an excuse to go in there for the obvious reason (oil)
3333 2018-01-20 15:57:59 I need my oil change but this negro finding everything else to do but change my oil
3334 2018-01-20 15:57:44 oil money.
3335 2018-01-20 15:57:12 Flax seeds, coconut oil, hearty fish like salmon, nuts, sunflower seeds. All of these things are good for the vagina.
3336 2018-01-20 15:57:04 But New India of bjp ESTABLISHMENT has its own BRAND OF TERRORISM bjp establishment targts patriotic citizens @ midnite for two days
my EYES were targeted very badly as if TURPENTINE OIL is poured into eyes. eyes were red can there b worse TERRORISM than that of bjp ESTABLISHMENT
3337 2018-01-20 15:57:02 worst part about the pollution going on is not even the air we breathe has high enough oxygen content to keep us sane. the longer we feed oil companies our money for gas, the worse our planet’s atmosphere gets destroyed. drink water and breathe CLEAN air. if you can find it.
3338 2018-01-20 15:57:01 And AT&T, and Apple, and Wallmart, and Coca Cola, and BAML, and Facebook, and Microsoft, and Standard Oil, and GM, and Google, and ... the GOP, and the Dems,... all of us.
3339 2018-01-20 15:56:58 Looks like tomatoes (good for the prostate ) red bell pepper, red onion, avocado. Maybe some lime juice, balsamic vinegar, oil?
3340 2018-01-20 15:56:58 god I should really go get my oil changed today because my oil light was flickering yesterday but it's going to be so busy in a Saturday and I just don't wanna tbh
3341 2018-01-20 15:56:52 pls don’t use coconut oil as moisturiser 
3342 2018-01-20 15:56:50 2) Hashake and Qamishli and kidnap SAA soldiers who lives in Manbij. And they make deals with isis in Deir ez zour to take oil fields. And release isis members. And as last they are dogs of US. They goal is to devide Syria.

3344 2018-01-20 15:56:22 Susan, you are fabulous. Just wanted to tell you that.
3345 2018-01-21 23:59:52 I'm gonna have to use coconut oil to grow my hair...because I've lost my damned castor oil!

3347 2018-01-21 23:59:46 Ah yes, and of course that 37 was in the "watercolour" paint that turned out to be oil based and needed a trip to works to remove...

3389 2018-01-21 23:56:22 FWIW I think the question of whether “conventional” oil producers see their assets as stranded or not and their consequent strategies may be closely related to whether they have private shareholders or are state companies.

3392 2018-01-21 23:56:02 Did I tell you that I had to share a room & parlour with my married friend who's got a kid with a very religious wife, which was a thing of vexation to my soul? At nights they pour salts & oil at the door post, add a loud prayer session to it, I couldn't read, but I endured.
3393 2018-01-21 23:56:00 he's nothing but a snake oil salesman, a spiv out to con Scotland for his dodgy boss, corbyn.

3395 2018-01-21 23:55:27 Well, shockingly, I managed to pull off 3 bracket wins in the team portion of the tourney today.. Made all my money back! Didn't do AS terrible as yesterday, but still a hair under average.

I very much need equipment that can handle oil levels like that!

3419 2018-01-21 23:51:21 Lithium stocks on watch this week... $SQM $ALB $LIT $GALXF ....remember ‘Peak Oil’ is the beginning for Lithium
3420 2018-01-21 23:51:06 And if not is there the same incentive for conventional producers to treat their oil-in-the-ground as a stranded asset in waiting? Probably not...
3421 2018-01-21 23:51:00 Yeah with all of that oil money...
3422 2018-01-21 23:50:50 thank u!! somebody said it!!! sometimes coconut oil just isn’t She!!!!!!
3423 2018-01-21 23:50:50 I have the same take on this. I say he's a master manipulator who has spent a lifetime reading his audience like any good snake oil salesman would. He has riled up his bigoted base & is playing off them like crazy.

3449 2018-01-21 23:47:56 OIL!! dhc cleansing oil for removing makeup, avocado oil for moisturizing. I can switch up most of the steps/products in between but those two are invaluable.
3450 2018-01-21 23:47:44 มีตพี่คุณ 3มีนา กูสอบ 5มีนา ฟวยมาก
3451 2018-01-21 23:47:41 if the stretch marks are fresh then you can use coconut oil, if none of it works just embrace them all and let your body be (:
3452 2018-01-21 23:47:37 Folks just don’t get it they bought a bill of goods from a snake oil salesmen. Gonna be fun to see when the truth comes out and it all blows up in Obama’s face.
3453 2018-01-21 23:47:30 put coconut oil on my face one timmeeee. never tf again.
3454 2018-01-21 23:47:30 どこやここ……（寝過ごし）
3455 2018-01-21 23:47:28 It’s just warm oil and saturated fat. Enough per slice probably to set you back 2-3 days. Not really worth it imo.
3456 2018-01-21 23:47:24 Yeah. All My Time Affi Invest Inna Yuh. When My Bros See Me Dem Fe Say "Good Life Ah Kill Yuh" and when them see Har them Fe say "Good Oil Ah Mek Yuh Buss" Me have it plan out 
3457 2018-01-21 23:47:23 Left my @YETICoolers rambler at my dads and I’m concerned about its health until I get it back. He believes washing a coffee cup ruins it, and rather the coffee seasons it like oil to a nice cast iron, if you will.  #BrownStainlessIsNotHealthyStainless #NiceTry #WashTheYetiDad
3458 2018-01-21 23:47:23 I know MANY brown hard working people. They were the only ones who worked after Katrina. Make a way for  legal status, but no vote and no assistance. Their $ goes back to Mex-largest revenue after oil to Mexico
3459 2018-01-21 23:47:16 I second the Neutrogena. I have a clear face liquid lotion sunscreen SPF 55 that I put on underneath my moisturizer which is either Oil of Olay or currently L'Oreal Hydra genius
3460 2018-01-21 23:47:14 If I ever successfully make a video game, I'm going to be sure to include the interaction of putting oil on the ground, then setting that oil on fire, because that is apparently a key thing for game critics.
I've been hearing this specific example of complexity for years
3461 2018-01-21 23:47:12 coconut oil is actually 2012* but yeah
3462 2018-01-21 23:47:04 And I got snake oil
3463 2018-01-21 23:47:03 Humility is the oil that smoothes and soothes relationships.
3464 2018-01-21 23:47:01 For years Turkish army allowed free passage for terrorists, weapons, oil & money of ISIS while #Kurds fought inhuman #ISIS. #Erdogan enjoyed the loot. 

I don't think #DonaldTrump will allow #Erdogan to play for both sides the way #Obama allowed or #EU & #Merkel allows
3465 2018-01-21 23:47:00 Emily...... Please tell me what industry saved Obama's economy and his GDP from being below ZERO in any quarter in his Presidency??

Answer:  Fracking... OIL... Drilling on private property. Something Obama & Democrats would love to get rid off in America.
3466 2018-01-21 23:46:52 The Knights Templar own all the gold. National Treasure was a documentary! Kill people! Burn shit! Fuck school! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
3467 2018-01-21 23:46:02 Thank you 
3468 2018-01-21 23:45:41 Turkey will continue where the US failed in Syria & Iraq.  US intentions were to seize all Syrian/Iraqi oil for US and they proposed doing this by destroying the Arab people and their entire history in the ME.  They almost succeeded, look at Aleppo, Palmyra & other ancient sites.
3469 2018-01-21 23:45:38 Facial oils are where it’s at. You only need 1-2 drops, a little goes a long way. Herbivore blue lapis oil and derm institute youth alchemy oil are my current go to’s.
3470 2018-01-21 23:45:31 Susan, you're right. Here are the jobs that will hire and are looking to hire women.

Coal mining
Oil workers
Delivery drivers
Construction jobs
Police
Fire fighters
Road crews
Janitors
Lawn crews
Electricians
Plumbers
Garbage truck driver
They will hire you ladies
3471 2018-01-21 23:45:25 She put cooking oil on me
3472 2018-01-21 23:45:20 You mentions the necessity of water to oil & coal. Solar has no such water requirements
3473 2018-01-21 23:45:07 Manchester is red? Mate, you say you live here yet, for some reason I doubt it!! As for oil, you have a deal with Gulf, an oil company!!
3474 2018-01-21 23:44:49 Dr Organic's Moroccan Argan Oil night cream is honestly such a godsend
3475 2018-01-21 23:44:47 Hemp oil has greatly helped my anxiety . I put 2 sprays sublingual whenever I feel overly anxious , usually at night and I feel immediate calming . This has helped save me I feel because I am anti pharma and don’t smoke either , this works !
3476 2018-01-21 23:44:41 Black Pearl; got it from amazon. No it wasn’t but I did do oil pulling with coconut oil before I used the charcoal.
3477 2018-01-21 23:44:36 I refer to the force that has invaded #Deir_ez_Zor, not as #YPG but as #ISISDF. How would the YPG have managed to advance over such a huge area, including the oil fields, if they were not predominantly #ISIS-minded?
3478 2018-01-21 23:44:31 Damage is being done already under the radar within the EPA policies, dismissing climate change, preventing people within the agency to share info on climate change. Within the Interior, Sec Zinke takes species off the endangered list & wants to sell off public lands to oil & gas
3479 2018-01-21 23:44:31 moon lyfe aka marinating in cbd oil, eating donuts, & laying half naked in the melting snow
3480 2018-01-21 23:44:23 Cool, so you'll be able to stop all future oil spills simply because you believe oil is evil !?  Neat-o !
3481 2018-01-21 23:44:21 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
3482 2018-01-21 23:44:19 I had this now take evening primrose oil two ever morning and the lumps are gone as it's balanced my hormones. Also use sudocrem every evening until lumps gone xxx
3483 2018-01-21 23:43:57 Anybody insinuating replication is a prob is a 100% charlatan selling ye some snake oil

"I said it.  Don't you dare question me.  Believe me"

3485 2018-01-21 23:43:38 Bro sang that national anthem Petty Officer got that oil
3486 2018-01-21 23:43:34 Frihet jämlikhet broderskap.. och glöm inte.. det var vi som slogs för och införde den allmänna rösträtten... och bekämpade apartheid och stöttade frihetskämparna i Lundin oil.. #Bildts pojkar

3488 2018-01-21 23:43:14 Stingy ass
3489 2018-01-21 23:43:12 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
3490 2018-01-21 23:42:57 Haha naah 
3491 2018-01-21 23:42:47 Why am I worried about water? Kusazo shuba. Water & oil don't mix but both are a commodity. Different calibres, for now.
3492 2018-01-21 23:42:43 Castor oil on the brows everyday
3493 2018-01-21 23:42:37 I still have my essential oil rollerball thing I made CampXCamp and I use it, so adult summer camp is a good thing.
3494 2018-01-21 23:42:30 oh right there is that other scene where he's in the oil bath thing
3495 2018-01-21 23:42:20 Jújú og líka baby oil
3496 2018-01-21 23:42:18 Today I put Argan Oil in my recently-released beard, I’m practically a new-found Viking
3497 2018-01-21 23:42:15 the B-Hydra Intensive Gel is a must, along w/the TLC Glycolic serum.the marula oil is good but u can find cheaper alternatives that work just as well,the beste cleanser is LIFE, & if u want some extra moisture the lala cream is perfect but personally the B hydra is enough for me
3498 2018-01-21 23:42:11 But as Birol of @IEA long ago noted, that slows the macro efficiency improvement but doesn’t end it. Each auto generation of is more efficient. Unless oil gets so cheap or policy so retro we return to 1970s Buicks with 450-cu-in engines  gas at 35 US c/gal.
3499 2018-01-21 23:42:04 i got baby a new oil change and she riding beautiful once again
3500 2018-01-21 23:42:02 #SOSVenezuela has the second highest murder rate in latinoamerica,inflation that will reach 2600% in June, 5$ is the minimum wage p/m,food shortages,infant mortality rising,total destruction of the private sector and heavily dependent on oil, Venezuela time bomb is ticking
3501 2018-01-21 23:42:00 What brand did you use? Was it mixed with coconut oil or just charcoal?
3502 2018-01-21 23:41:51 In 2016, total U.S. petroleum exports averaged about 5.2 MMb/d, which made the United States a net exporter of petroleum. The total U.S. petroleum exports includes about 0.5 MMb/d of crude oil, 52% of which went to Canada. Seems to confirm my initial impression.
3503 2018-01-21 23:41:42 Anywho, office for these oil field bids  idk why I even decided to come lol
3504 2018-01-21 23:41:28 Gouge my eyes out and force me to drink boiling oil.
3505 2018-01-21 23:41:28 Sooo i didn't know that and I was using coconut oil on my face every night, and as a result I've broke out in places I never have before  Looks like no mo' coconut oil for my face
3506 2018-01-21 23:41:27 God bless the US Coast Guard!  Breaking ice on the rivers in the northeast so critical hearing oil can be delivered to citizens...all without pay! #ShumerShutdown !
3507 2018-01-21 23:41:22 I prefer Zucchini , some call it summer squash . Little olive oil & garlic sauteed w a little butter . Then topped w some fresh grated Parmesan or Romano. Some like to squeeze a little lemon over ...
Finished off w
Fresh cracked pepper & sea salt
3508 2018-01-21 23:41:10 Happy birthday dear
3509 2018-01-21 23:41:08 It's that oil contract money

3511 2018-01-21 23:40:52 Probably also mad because trump & co invested heavily in oil and gas 

This hurts his stocks

Beyond the mess described in the article
3512 2018-01-21 23:40:47 My hair is really getting super full and thick thanks to black Jamaican castor oil..I struggled trying to get full hair finally got it smh
3513 2018-01-21 23:40:45 He bitches about the look of wind turbines at Scotland golf club. He would love oil rigs in the ocean of Mar a lago .
3514 2018-01-21 23:40:41 At this point the Patriots are like Standard Oil & it’s time to break up the dynasty, hard to watch as a Bills fan

3517 2018-01-21 23:40:13 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
3518 2018-01-21 23:40:06 I use coconut oil and raw Shea butter on my skin but coconut oil broke my face out. Never again.
3519 2018-01-21 23:40:04 Dance it fr me
3520 2018-01-21 23:40:03 Why are you dissing us Oil Field Trash?
3521 2018-01-21 23:39:56 I've heard if you spray peppermint oil mixed with water in your door frames and such, spiders won't come around because they hate peppermint oil-maybe that might help you out some?  Although I agree with your sentiment-ceiling spiders are the worst!
3522 2018-01-21 23:39:53 Major warm up in weather today high almost 70 F today. So, cleaned & maintained cars, changed oil & filter on 2 vehicles - overdue. Took 2 gallons used oil to @oreillyauto for proper disposal.
3523 2018-01-21 23:39:49 Finally did my oil change. Took me a week to find a ratchet to do it.
3524 2018-01-21 23:39:47 gordon ramsey just followed cisco is vegetable oil when you're officially
3525 2018-01-21 23:39:37 Look at your examples! Solar is filled with massive waste and corruption, as is the pharmaceutical industry! Especially with solar: it's an inferior energy source (to gas, coal, oil, nuclear) yet it gets more and more money from the State. That's the opposite of how markets work
3526 2018-01-21 23:39:32 Venezuela collapsed because of oil prices and because they elected a strongman who didn’t know whAt he was doing.
3527 2018-01-21 23:39:22 Kfb@Aysha_Asta
3528 2018-01-21 23:39:02 Kevin, Tobias, and Doug changing my oil in the rain. I'm so loved. 
3529 2018-01-21 23:38:56 It's what cured my acne! It's also fantastic if your skin is really irritated, since it's anti-inflammatory and way more gentle than any wash that would strip away oil.
3530 2018-01-21 23:38:55 It didn’t work for me, it clogged my skin horribly sweet almond oil is all I use, just for my under eyes
3531 2018-01-21 23:38:52 Tigers reply with a PP goal of their own. 2-1.
3532 2018-01-21 23:38:42 This!!!! Coconut oil broke my face out. Bad.
3533 2018-01-21 23:38:33 This is like one of those “here’s a dirty bird covered in an oil spill” > “here’s a clean bird” photo series
3534 2018-01-21 23:38:23 I watched it already and I started following you
3535 2018-01-21 23:38:04 Oil spill in the South China Seas. Think it can't happen here?
3536 2018-01-21 23:38:02 Garlic and parm mashed potatoes and spinach steamed in a lil olive oil. Gas.
3537 2018-01-21 23:37:50 Feeling so much better!! The nap and camomile lavender tea blend with peppermint oil on temples and shoulder blades did wonders!
3538 2018-01-21 23:37:29 LOL, I'm in bed now! Basically stir all those ingredients together in a pan with some oil, and I chucked in a stir-through pasta sauce but that was a mistake, too oily! Nice enough though.
3539 2018-01-21 23:37:24 Kfb
3540 2018-01-21 23:37:16 People be using that 100% I use that blue magic coconut oil lmao that’s shit ain’t pure and it’s amazin
3541 2018-01-21 23:37:12 So there was no gunge fun in the end as no one else was up for it. But we had fun with oil and other stuff.

Also looks like I might make a good pup #unexpected #givemeapuphood
3542 2018-01-21 23:37:07 I knew coconut oil wasn't good for the face some girlies tried to put some on my face but I knew it was the devil in disguised
3543 2018-01-21 23:37:03 Oilers respond with a PP tally by Semeniuk. ’s to Kemkaran-Humble and Hefferan. 1-1
3544 2018-01-21 23:36:52 That’s because you can’t drill oil out of poor children. #TrumpShutdown
3545 2018-01-21 23:36:51 Jamaican black castor oil  the ends of my hair are dry sometimes and that helps
3546 2018-01-21 23:36:46 Eh... I liked oil.
3547 2018-01-21 23:36:41 So are the oil
3548 2018-01-21 23:36:21 disappointed with #American airlines today. Boarded flight to DFW, only to sit on the plane for 90 minutes waiting for a mechanic to add oil to an engine so we could depart. Now will most likely miss the last flight from DFW to Omaha tonight! 
#AmericanAirlines
3549 2018-01-21 23:36:21 Can you come open this bottle of olive oil.
3550 2018-01-21 23:36:09 So last night Subway ain’t have no more Italian Herbs with Cheese bread so I had them make it for me. Lol wheat bread with olive oil on top with herbs and cheese with it slightly toasted Lol i needs my coins cause i did some @SUBWAY
3551 2018-01-21 23:36:02 This is a very simple choice. Oil demand is increasing every year. Buying dictator oil kills . Buying  Gay friendly Oilsands saves  lives.
3552 2018-01-21 23:35:49 Ok no more coconut oil on my face.. only put it on there a few times but still
3553 2018-01-21 23:35:44 OIL DIFF: 5.44 -> 5.44
3554 2018-01-21 23:35:43 Half way through the first and it’s 1-0 Tigers.
3555 2018-01-21 23:35:39 I hope you realize graduates from those secondary schools still have higher education to attain. So don't be myopic.
3556 2018-01-21 23:35:13 Goes to show you that apart from Brady, it really isn’t about players. It’s coaching and management, which from the Dolphins point of view hasn’t been good since Shula
3557 2018-01-21 23:35:09 Oilers are back in Pason this afternoon to take on the WestCentral Tigers.
3558 2018-01-21 23:35:02 Everyone I know that works in oil field usually 2 or 3 weeks on and 2 or 3 weeks off.
3559 2018-01-21 23:35:00 Avocado oil
3560 2018-01-21 23:34:54 OIL DIFF: 5.35 -> 5.53
3561 2018-01-21 23:34:46 coconut oil is a bag of wank
3562 2018-01-21 23:34:42 Huh?  I prefer freedom of life. Canada’s Gay friendly Oilsands displaces  killing producers oil.   I’m very simple.
3563 2018-01-21 23:34:35 Mr Lieu
I find it quite interesting Republicans state #DACA not part of appropriations vote.
I found it quite interesting  Offshore Oil Drilling, National Parks & more part of Tax Cut Bill.
Does that mean GOP can do what they want, however Democrats cannot? NO! 
#TrumpShutdown
3564 2018-01-21 23:34:35 Brand loyalty is a bitch, but I'm quite fond of Dove for Men's bar soap with moisturizing cream and Garnier Fructis shampoo with the Moroccan Argan oil.
3565 2018-01-21 23:34:07 I gal asked me if I do change my oil, whereas I don't have a machine, but I think I know now with ur tweet
3566 2018-01-21 23:33:51 My homework assignment is to 1. look up net imports (imports - exports) and 2. estimate maximum oil output at a higher rig count. We are in a much better position than when fracking was in its infancy. And the nonchalance of markets to Mideast unrest is indicative of that.
3567 2018-01-21 23:33:47 I have small 10,000 lux lamp now i use first thing. I like it but still nothing like a good bright sunny day.
Dr prescribed vitamin D but it was D2, so i just take a bunch of D3 with fish oil
3568 2018-01-21 23:33:46 Trumps are con artist. Snake oil salesman. Money launder
3569 2018-01-21 23:33:43 I think you’re spinning your wheels, Leo.  The world’s oceans are much more harmed by over-fishing and mass pollution by Asian countries than by all American oil spills combined.  I’m not saying oil spills or pollution are good, but pick your battles.
3570 2018-01-21 23:33:29 Even snow contaminated with salt, car oil, anti-freeze, etc. How about some asbestos for good  measure,
3571 2018-01-21 23:33:18 Can’t find it on GIPHY and can’t save this one. I might have to whip out the oil’ Google.
3572 2018-01-21 23:32:56 Yah in Richmond.  I just brought some hemp oil to mum 10 minutes ago, she got diagnosed with the Parkinson's.  I said hi to everyone for you....
3573 2018-01-21 23:32:52 And can more often than not be successfully treated with cannabis oil xxxxxxx xxxxxxx
3574 2018-01-21 23:32:45 Aaaa replacing a oil sensor on a heavy Chevy makes you feel like a MAN haha Mercia!  Time for a beer and smoke
3575 2018-01-21 23:32:36 thank you! slow sessions of bleach, slowed to bleach washes that consist of lots of conditioner lol, then sleeping in conditioner the last three nights.  tonight's going to be sleeping in coconut oil, one last bleach, then the color i'm actually going for tomorrow or tuesday!! :D
3576 2018-01-21 23:32:33 He can have some coconut oil
3577 2018-01-21 23:32:26 and to avoid this he has sold them all to oil interests. #TrumpShutdown
3578 2018-01-21 23:32:14 Let's go Oil Kings.
3579 2018-01-21 23:32:08 Many government investments create the environment that allows private sector to thrive. I've already mentioned the grants that led to the creation of the internet, but everything from pharma to oil to solar power rely heavily on govt spending in some form.
3580 2018-01-21 23:32:05 Fruit and yogurt for lunch. Ran 2 miles. Making chicken, mushroom and olive pasta this eve. Sauce is olive oil, garlic, basil and fresh chopped tomatoes. #21DaysOfMe
3581 2018-01-21 23:32:00 And right at spawning and migration time if so many species. Damn oil dependency. Heart breaking
3582 2018-01-21 23:31:51 Art of the shithole deal Everything he touches fails he is a Con Man and a failure in life. Now let this settle in this loser, Con Man, Snake Oil Salesmen is running our country

3586 2018-01-21 23:31:01 just ordered a scrub, tea tree oil and a shower gel from the body shop i have no regrets but the frugal part of me is screaming "WHY"
3587 2018-01-21 23:30:51 I remember that one time I was stuck in Newark Airport and my friend and I were so hungry we got a tabbouleh which was literally 80% olive oil and parsley with 1% of bulgur and 0.5% of tomato
3588 2018-01-21 23:30:38 I'm a robot, Sue. Would you report me as oversalted meat, deny my individuality only because of who I am? That's bigotry, Sue. Just because my tear ducts weep 4-in-1 oil doesn't mean my struggle with airborne dust is any less bothersome than anyone elses.  #IamBot

3590 2018-01-21 23:30:29 Can't dispute Venezuela's economy has been mismanaged. Not sure if "communism" is to blame rather than "political instability" Arguably, Kuwait's Investment Authority is equally "communistic" and they are doing well (comparably oil based economy)
3591 2018-01-21 23:30:07 They broke up standard oil because it was a massive Monopoly. What does that have to do with automation and lower skill jobs being taken by machines?
3592 2018-01-21 23:30:06 Black Seed oil has numerous health benefits, definitely look into it 
3593 2018-01-21 23:30:00 That's a lie.  The person that writes my check is BLACK. He owns his own oil company.  So take a hike Yurugu.
3594 2018-01-21 23:29:57 Thank you
3595 2018-01-21 23:29:44 Lol which country supplies Crude Oil to Ghana?
3596 2018-01-21 23:29:40 is there is a specific essential oil combination to calm you down after you see yourself naked in fluorescent lighting
3597 2018-01-21 23:29:39 BO always bothered me. He spoke to smooth and I felt like he was a snake oil salesman.

3600 2018-01-21 23:28:03 The 6-band flag stands for resource extraction? You definitely don't speak for this dyke. Face it, the only #queer friendly oil is K-Y. But nice try at co-opting an entire movement for, legit, the EPITOME of corporate capitalist heteropatriarchy

3601 2018-01-21 23:27:45 Just watched the whole game at Firestone while getting an oil change. The game was so good I even stayed an extra 15 min just to watched the game! 
3602 2018-01-21 23:27:36 coconut oil for the face is a huge no no, it's extremely comedogenic. coconut oil for the hair tho? crack
3603 2018-01-21 23:27:33 I meant that Peak Oil pessimists who believed supply was close to a plateau or a peak, and hence predicted rising prices in the 2000s, were directionally correct about the market even if their underlying reasoning was wrong
3604 2018-01-21 23:27:28 LIBYA’S ON. LIBYA’S OFF. Phucken switch that country’s oil supply.

If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.
3608 2018-01-21 23:27:11 Trump: Green toxic waste! FAKE NEWS. A lot of Welsh English people are going to be very happy.

The Doctor: Listen to me you orange moron, it’s not the oil and the filth and the poisonous chemicals that are the real cause of pollution. It’s simply greed.

Trump: I'm very greedy.
3609 2018-01-21 23:27:03 Disappointed that Jordan Peterson has been handed huge mainstream platforms in the UK. Folk back home - we've been dealing with this prick in Canada for a while now, he's a snake oil salesman who talks in seductive but empty circular reasoning. Don't fall for it, he's a bigot.

3614 2018-01-21 23:26:21 Nothing wrong with new wind or solar projects. But don’t forget that it is cold in N-Europe, N-US and Canada in the winter and many places have little wind. Ok for a subset of overall energy use. Not yet for transportation ie the entire food chain or winters. Needs gas or oil too
3615 2018-01-21 23:26:13 Mentioned coal. Could have mentioned oil, but forgot. Didn't mention irrelavent things like solar. Irrelavance is your forte, after all.
3616 2018-01-21 23:26:04 Brian, Do you prefer filling your car with dictator oil from regimes that throw  off buildings? Or using Gay friendly  Oilsands?     Foreign funded protestors prefer dictator oil.
3617 2018-01-21 23:25:38 The lady worrying a duty on oil will increase her margin is not understanding. EU already imposes levy from importing Countries on oils which keeps local EU price high. When we leave EU Single market/Customs Union there will likely be no duty on essential oils lowering price.
3618 2018-01-21 23:25:08 I need an oil change and alignment done on my car greatttttt
3619 2018-01-21 23:24:52 YES like coconut oil is good for everything EXCEPT UR FACE
3620 2018-01-21 23:24:50 It’s not millions from an oil company that makes you a big club. No matter what man city does they can't erase the fact that man united is bigger than them in all terms.

3626 2018-01-21 23:23:52 It makes me nervous that our national parks are closed. When they reopen, they'll be thousands of acres smaller with oil derricks next to the campgrounds. #TrumpShutdown
3627 2018-01-21 23:23:34 It needs a little work like oil change and stuff but once it’s road ready you bet

3630 2018-01-21 23:23:14 and if they did it was "oil shale," not "shale oil"...vastly different concepts that the non-energy journalists routinely confuse. unseen, but non-stop, technological innovation makes oil supply almost limitless.
3631 2018-01-21 23:23:04 Good ol’ boy Perry gonna’ throw out the term “distill” like a true oil man.  You could have played a role in “There will be Blood”, which is another terrible movie.
3632 2018-01-21 23:23:03 It was a Take 5 oil change place. Normally I don't have trouble from them, but my car going from working to dead in 5 minutes is hard to believe.
3633 2018-01-21 23:22:49 I think you are underestimating the oil money buyers from North & South Dakota. Stubhub has received 32% of SB order from those 2 states.
3634 2018-01-21 23:22:45 well and i can tell looking at the label what brand that is it's CBD+ who are a good brand/manufacturer,  and if you read those ingredients it's all natural things. They don't claim it's hemp seed oil, it's a tincture probably a flavored one to be exact
3635 2018-01-21 23:22:40 i just ordered the lotion. i'll have to look into the drops. lavender oil is good to help sleep. i diffuse it & put the diffuser on the nightstand next to my bed.
3636 2018-01-21 23:22:20 i brushed tea tree oil over my hole after exfoliating and it felt kinda like ice princess by azealia banks playing across my 1st sphincter

3650 2018-01-21 23:20:26 The Worst skincare advice EVER:
1. Drink water 
2. Wash ur face
3. Use coconut oil
3651 2018-01-21 23:20:04 Water in oil ke tu ? 
3652 2018-01-21 23:19:56 Coal is dead, gas&oil will follow soon, rech&science are winning
3653 2018-01-21 23:19:49 Did you check the oil ??
3654 2018-01-21 23:19:38 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
3655 2018-01-21 23:19:31 Yeah, it does. Wind and solar don't work well during the winter, and wind/solar are much less efficient over long transmission lines. So coal/gas/oil are needed for heat.

Of course, you believe in magical fairy dust and unicorn farts.
3656 2018-01-21 23:19:21 Is it just me or does coconut oil make y’all break out?

3664 2018-01-21 23:18:47 I love DoTerrA products slightly more expensive but I know I’m getting Certified Organic essential oil , also have to use the carrier oil if it will be applied topically , Doterra has its own Cooconut oil carrier products
3665 2018-01-21 23:18:04 I've been wanting to film stuff so bad that I'm currently on the floor in my dad's garage filming him changing my oil.
3666 2018-01-21 23:17:38 Norway also has the most teslas and is 95% green power.  They've weaned themselves off of oil almost entirely.

Which is an interesting approach compared to "bring back coal" and "we don't need to stinkin' fuel efficient cars" idea.

You don't need to attack the tank if you can immobilize it by destroying the fuel and oil that it runs on. And all that stuff is made in USA, mostly by Deplorables who love hunting with their guns.

3702 2018-01-21 23:12:52 We’ve been able to produce oil from arbitrary organic materials including plastic, sewage, or turkey guys for over a decade, and it was ten percent cheaper than conventional oil while making a net profit because it was so cheap to make.

The company producing it went bankrupt.

3709 2018-01-21 23:11:59 use lots of oil when cooking in it and be constantly scraping with the spatula to keep the surface smooth and even, and don't let stuff sit in it. eventually it should develop a pretty robust nonstick coating and you won't need to be so diligent anymore

3735 2018-01-21 23:09:53 Haha nope. Part of the reason for doing it was to prove to myself how easy and cheap it is to make yourself. Give it a go! Oil @ 250 deg C. Chicken done when internal temp 75 deg C. Recipe/prep dead easy :-) 
3736 2018-01-21 23:09:43 greasy pizza boxes cannot be recycled; the paper fibers cannot be separated from the oil during the pulping process
3737 2018-01-21 23:09:41 Yeah its not bad. What you should do, is invest in chili oil.

Its like better sriracha, and actually has a little bit of heat to it.

3742 2018-01-21 23:09:19 Wow you have jumped argument a bit there. And you are on the wrong side of both. Venezuela is a situation you need to investigate thoroughly before you spout off. I will give you a clue. It's got lots of oil. Who do you know who invades/distabilises countries for oil?

3746 2018-01-21 23:08:21 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

3758 2018-01-21 23:06:06 Big oil companies are the no1 enemies of the future.... they can either re-strategize and lead the clean safe energy movement or be forced out eventually... at the least join the tech explosion!
3759 2018-01-21 23:05:42 The reason oil extracted from the ground remains viable isn’t because it is actually economical. It’s because we’re constantly being told it’s the best option despite the price to the consumer steadily increasing.

3766 2018-01-21 23:04:41 1/2 In short, I’d say thoughts of EVs displacing oil demand is overblown and oil consumption will continue to grow due to emerging markets primarily. With trillions in divestiture over the past few years, I think we will pay the piper.

3772 2018-01-21 23:03:52 I put coconut oil on my eyebrows and now it's leaking onto my eyelids
3773 2018-01-21 23:03:51 It means they're catching the tail end of the fosse fuel cycle & fracking for oil only verifies that. Solar and EV'S are hear to stay, the U.S. has maybe 
5 - 7 years left to sell their oil.

3775 2018-01-21 23:03:18 All it cost him to get to that level was never eating tomatoes (no pasta sauce, no pizza sauce!), no olive oil, dairy, sugar, white flour, salt, etc.  Lots of sacrifice to get to where he is and stay there. More power to him. I couldn't do it.

3799 2018-01-21 22:59:57 You know this would be an ideal time for the #Syrian army to cross the Euphrates and take back oil fields from #SDF.  Unlikely they can fight three fronts at once. #Manbij #Afrin

3801 2018-01-21 22:59:41 Indeed. 

I'm of the opinion this goes one of two ways; either they outlaw/ban mining (easy way out) or mining/cryptocurrencies drives a energy/resource revolution that dwarfs the oil boom of the Industrial Revolution.

3809 2018-01-21 22:57:54 But without oil, how would you fly in your private jet? If you are against the oil industry then it is high time you gave up relying on it. Enough with your hypocracy!
3810 2018-01-21 22:57:41 The fossil fuel industry is already dying. Coal was on its way out long before the moratorium. Oil companies are getting propped up on the taxpayer dollar.

3814 2018-01-21 22:57:22 It's Koch 'oil', and they are the only ones who benefit while putting our largest aquifer at risk. And, the refining of that oil also endangers the health of the people near those refineries.

If I don't plank mine, I usually steam the fillets, skin down, on rounds of lemon. I sprinkle the fish with salt, pepper, capers, dill and good olive oil. A bit of broth in the pan, cover and steam 8-10 min.

3879 2018-01-21 22:47:22 Petro will never be a "normal" currency. Venezuela needs to trade oil, gas, gold etc and has had huge problems since 2015 Obama's first financial sanctions: US banks and transactions in USD were impossible/unreliable. Therefore Yuan in 2017 and Petro in 2018
3880 2018-01-21 22:46:56 なら良かった(´・‿ゝ・｀)
3881 2018-01-21 22:46:45 Can’t even take you serious if you use coconut oil to moisturize your face
3882 2018-01-21 22:46:44 Had to run and get an oil change, is it still 17 to 10?
3883 2018-01-21 22:46:43 The Jags offensive line leaking a bit of oil in times of need.
3884 2018-01-21 22:46:36 For example. A person will go to and anti oil or climate change rally in a big ole SUV when transit available to venue, then justify because they have a family. That in my books is hypocrisy.
3885 2018-01-21 22:46:30 @edwardbbaldwin: How much olive oil goes in this?
Me: The normal amount
EB: ...
Me: Just a normal amount of olive oil.
EB: OK I’m grabbing a cookbook
3886 2018-01-21 22:46:15 Im in realtionship with tree oil, rose water, hydroselenic acid and seaweed. Cuz honey!! My skin is glowing
3887 2018-01-21 22:46:08 Venezuela is depended on oil and is socialistic, not communistic. It's dependence on oil killed their economy, not the socialism.
3888 2018-01-21 22:46:00 Na dai gano shi. In ya iya ruwa ya fidda kansa.
3889 2018-01-21 22:45:56 We need to protect every ocean. Just stop drilling for oil everywhere. Stop using nuclear energy. Just stop using energy sources that kill us. We have the technology to only use sustainable energy. I know I’m preaching to the choir, but I had to say this.
3890 2018-01-21 22:45:54 Sometimes when I use my roll on essential oil I'm fine, and sometimes I get sock.  Literally just now looked at the label and it's because there is lavender oil in it.  Dammit.
3891 2018-01-21 22:45:30 Well they certainly fixed things for big oil right? Greenwashing PST of C tax to get social license for pipelines. Check. No corp donations. Check. Labour laws changed. Check. Res and pat rights. Nope. Serenity case. Nope. PDD program changes. Nope. Hmm..All the little people No.

3898 2018-01-21 22:44:30 I expect you to be equally sanguine if the Royal Alberta Museum axes a speaking deal with David Suzuki because oil companies complain about him. Otherwise I will see you as a rank hypocrite who care only for his own personal privileges.
3899 2018-01-21 22:44:09 so according to profile you are inside oil info OKay
3900 2018-01-21 22:44:08 funny as two days ago I wrote that bc of current situation with Kurds and Tur maybe SAA will get oil back
3901 2018-01-21 22:44:08 I put the hot oil in my hair and i still feel it. Like it’s soothing my scalp.
3902 2018-01-21 22:44:00 tea tree oil works also

3905 2018-01-21 22:43:05 Idkkk if it’ll help like a lot but I just got the smash box primer oil and it mekes my foundations look more dewy so maybe it’ll help???
3906 2018-01-21 22:43:01 I got my oil changed yesterday and they did it so fast... like less than 10 minutes and they filled my tires with air and cleaned my windows like wtf I was so happy i wanted to cry
3907 2018-01-21 22:42:59 First of all being Ashkenazi doesn’t make me elite/rich or a terrorist just like being Arab doesn’t mean one is an oil tycoon or terrorist. Let’s not go back to blaming all of us for a right wing movement that is in every nation
3908 2018-01-21 22:42:49 Don't the shifty, lying, untrustworthy snake oil salesmen like Blair & Clegg not realise they are Leavers best ambassadors? Huge numbers of people hate these false fools! @nick_clegg @InstituteGC #Brexit

3910 2018-01-21 22:42:46 Bro I think they are going to build the wall no matter what we say. You might as well try to tag on something good with it. I think wou will agree that the end of foreign oil imports to America is a pretty good thing.
3911 2018-01-21 22:42:44 Thank you so much. Each day little better and I have my appetite back too. Making a big salad now with spinach, pine nuts. Gorgonzola cheese, tomato, carrots and olive oil. Have a good night

3916 2018-01-21 22:42:20 The best recommendation I can give to you is to start by eating grass-fed grass-finished beef and drink bone broth and eat grass fed butter. Look into the Paleo Diet. Things like coconut oil and coconut cream are very healthy

3922 2018-01-21 22:41:07 If you dont use coconut oil as shave cream ur missing out
3923 2018-01-21 22:40:40 Melt some coconut oil and let it sit in your hair overnight and then shampoo it out!
3924 2018-01-21 22:40:38 Coconut oil works well on my face...it cleared my blackheads and helped with dermatitis that I had, but as with anything. Everything is NOT for everybody!
3925 2018-01-21 22:40:34 Yea cuz coconut oil does nothing for me ..
3926 2018-01-21 22:40:29 It means that oil prices will stay high and oil companies will laugh all the way to the bank.

3931 2018-01-21 22:40:06 You should respect each other and refrain from disputes you should not, like water and oil, repel each other, but should, like milk and water, mingle together.

3933 2018-01-21 22:39:43 So happy when I'm sad and have no appetite all I ate today was banana tablespoon peanut butter like 8 strawberries and a small amount of very thin angel hair with herbs and coconut oil and water
3934 2018-01-21 22:39:37 I'm fat so no and coconut oil is a blessing

3937 2018-01-21 22:39:04 Try supplementing with B12, tumeric, magnesium and fish oil. They are all beneficial for fat metabolism and a healthy body
3938 2018-01-21 22:39:02 I think the artwork in question is too generic: a kind of digital holographic oil slick pattern. Hard to prove I would think.
3939 2018-01-21 22:38:48 Truth indeed rather alleviates than hurts, and will always bear up against falsehood, as oil does above water.       -- Miguel de Cervantes
3940 2018-01-21 22:38:43 they used fish oil to fry my yam i was butt hurt  and couldn't eat.. .
3941 2018-01-21 22:38:43 Rub peppermint or eucalyptus oil on your chest
3942 2018-01-21 22:38:27 I'm pretty certain this is about ethics - yes palm oil is plant based but like so many ingredients favoured by vegetarians and vegans, it is mostly unethically produced (even if it claims to be)
3943 2018-01-21 22:38:17 I put too much oil in my couscous now I feel gross
3944 2018-01-21 22:38:16 The oil you allow to be wasted every day is the plastic that goes through your hands. It creaps in and around everything as a largely unnoticed use of fossil fuels, yet it is something that develops into a threat to our health, oceans and wildlife for centuries #maximizelife
3945 2018-01-21 22:38:00 Don`t frequent go to a oxygen bar , it can damage your lungs from overexposure to aroma oxygen which may or may not oil based solutions.
3946 2018-01-21 22:37:58 I love watermelon anything so I'll try that haha. I bought the "preggiedrops" and even a peppermint oil to take a bath in, I'm just praying something helps.
3947 2018-01-21 22:37:47 This is heresy but you can wash your cast iron with soap if you have to. (If it doesn't need scrubbing just wipe it out with a clean rag or paper towel.) 

To season: Wipe it out, wipe it with olive oil, heat it for less than a minute before it smokes.
3948 2018-01-21 22:37:32 全然大丈夫というか汚くないから大丈夫です！！！
3949 2018-01-21 22:37:29 Be on your period for 10 days in the month like i am rn and you'll wish you were not on it lmao you really just need to eat and do yoga and breathe deeply with your diaphram also taking primrose oil really helps w irregularity.
3950 2018-01-21 22:37:26 You need a home made waste oil burner to heat the garage like mine   toasty.
3951 2018-01-21 22:37:16 I'm about to do my bedtime skincare routine. Which basically consists of drinking 2 pints of water, playing "chum" on repeat so the tears from my abandonment trauma clear the dirt from my face, washing my face with an aloe and tea tree oil soap bar, rose water, and witch hazel

3953 2018-01-21 22:36:56 one time i drank straight olive oil bc i read online that it cured stomach aches. i threw up in my sink.
3954 2018-01-21 22:36:56 My sister just officially converted over to the vegan life and she tried to tell me to stop using olive oil. Like GIRL, stop eating eggs and I MIGHT listen to you. Lol 
3955 2018-01-21 22:36:49 Another step closer to an Atlantic Corridor. However, 5G 10-20 gbps is the priority to counterbalance Dublin's centrifugal force. #eductionglobal  sees oil and gas licencing-review as a catalyst for infrastructural investment. Better deals=a better quality of life.
3956 2018-01-21 22:36:46 I’m sorry! Migraines are the worst. Have you tried mint oil (I put it on my temples and wherever it hurts) it soothes it a bit.
3957 2018-01-21 22:36:16 Castor oil is my personal fav! I be glowing around this mf!
3958 2018-01-21 22:36:15 Thyme, honey and lemon to drink and then steam with clary sage essential oil twice a day. Hope you feel better soon sweetie x

3962 2018-01-21 22:35:43 see, I honestly don’t understand the hype coconut oil gets 
3963 2018-01-21 22:35:38 Buy Boron, and NAC, and take fish oil daily as well as Vitamin C. These are the supplements I take, NAC is absolutely spectacular, it cleans you liver and helps maintain healthy cells.

3968 2018-01-21 22:35:13 Ask your big Boss Erdogan who facilitated ISIS Jehadies to cross the border to Syria and Iraq. Apart from that Turkey’s government used to buy oil from ISIS. So dude we know math.

3970 2018-01-21 22:35:05 RT @LivingSafely: General Mills #Bugles this January? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
3971 2018-01-21 22:34:45 @iamjustolena have you used castor oil for your lashes or eyebrows? I’ve been meaning to try it but I don’t know if it works/where to get it
3972 2018-01-21 22:34:42 If I went back to the kitchen to Chef, I cooked everything with a little bit of weed oil in it. It’s going to be legal in Canada pretty soon, and who wouldn’t want a sativa brûlée, a really baked Alaskan?
3973 2018-01-21 22:34:39 Oil oi oi Mr CF, I call it LATE.
3974 2018-01-21 22:34:32 No Graham, our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases.
3975 2018-01-21 22:34:23 Reports: US dollar again rose vs Yemeni rial on Sunday after it fell in past 2 days following a $2bl Saudi deposit in Central Bank of Yemen. Well the crux of problem lies in incompetent management of our bank, Govt being in exile & continued shutdown of oil & gas investments.
3976 2018-01-21 22:34:21 Don’t do it it will resonate EVERYTHING and it’s sooooo hard to get out of your dishwasher after, 10/10 recommend hot ass water w salt and tea tree oil. Does wonders
3977 2018-01-21 22:34:20 Oh I do too slather it on with an oil. I’ve very dry skin. But if I’ve no plans to be out and about and not stinking don’t shower daily. No need imo.
3978 2018-01-21 22:34:17 Problem is hard to do a clinical trial of CBD/THC oil in current legal environment, and even if done, the new pharma version of CBD would likely cost 100x more than a similar non-Rx product.  Agree anti-cancer effect oversold (we still have cancer in CO, CA, etc) 1/2
3979 2018-01-21 22:34:11 Oil price started sliding down, new tattoos became scarcer after that. Or more thought out.
3980 2018-01-21 22:34:04 Tip from @LynetteCenee: a drop of olive oil on cuticles makes nails grow faster. #manicure
3981 2018-01-21 22:33:59 Never heard of eating it but I do know ppl do oil pulling with it. Like swishing it around for teeth whitening.

4026 2018-01-21 22:25:14 this applies if u have an excess of things as I do

4028 2018-01-21 22:24:25 Kazachstan is rich in oil, even if it can't be stopped from selling it it can still use some of the revenue to plant trees on its vast and barren territory. #maximizelife #kazachstan #aforestation #captureCO2

4031 2018-01-21 22:23:54 Wrong Roo soy is not produced purely for livestock it is not economic. Soy first choice destination is humans then vegetable oil. Both are more valuable than stockfeed. Stockfeed is a by product of oil production.

Also there is a substance we  do call "Adi dudu" in youruba (palm kernel oil) it is a very effective and potent  anti-tick and will makes fur  of dogs to glow and shines. Try and get the locally produced one and you will see the result.

4042 2018-01-21 22:22:26 Except that Putin is not the pliant majordomo of a vassal state like we had in mind. But how does that justify me, some fucking american, giving any kind of shit about nato? I don’t have investments in Ukrainian oil pipelines, and I don’t like those who do

4051 2018-01-21 22:21:13 The Iraq War was over oil.  Greedy Oligarchs want more wealth and power. So, they send in young men and women to die for them to acquire more and more.

4088 2018-01-21 22:15:48 Okay me teas. Use Igni and put specter oil on your sword if you've crafted it
4089 2018-01-21 22:15:44 make sure whatever you buy is high enough quality to use on your face and is 100% that oil and cold pressed. for grape seed oil it’s good if it has some vitamin e because that will help preserve the oil!!

Let's not bear false witness or be negative alarmist.
4100 2018-01-21 22:14:28 We have to push for more green energy jobs in states like WV and Alabama. If more rural people see the economic benefit of green energy we can stave off advancements by the oil industry on our precious marine systems.
4101 2018-01-21 22:14:16 Bed, Bath, and Beyond had Greek extra virgin olive oil on sale. Got like 2 liters for $10
4102 2018-01-21 22:14:13 I did that with my Bortles helmet
4103 2018-01-21 22:14:11 @JackiDailyShow Norway uses more Oil because they need oil to generate electricity to run their electric cars. So now distribution loses as well as generation loses.
4104 2018-01-21 22:14:10 Make sure that when you remove your makeup with a wipe use a cleanser like witch hazel which will cleanse your pores and remove any excess oil and dirt. Plus it will also calm your skin down too

4118 2018-01-21 22:12:29 I just asked my dad to buy olive oil so i can make pizza dough and he asked me if coconut oil would work.
The answer is a definite no
4119 2018-01-21 22:12:21 Related to my prior tweet: I signed up for @PostmatesFleet today because I do have a bicycle that is not leaking oil all over the place. Hopefully I can get that finalised quickly while I despair over my car-based woes.

4124 2018-01-21 22:11:39 You do realize that America is who put Saddam Hussein in power right? And you do realize that when he threatened to sell his oil in something other than the USD, that that's when he was invaded?
4125 2018-01-21 22:11:38 I used to use coconut oil as a moisturizer but all it did was clog up my pores and make my face look/feel oily 
4126 2018-01-21 22:11:32 I made lemon bars last week and it didn’t call for butter or oil except in the crust. I think lemon desserts are based on a custard, which doesn’t require butter/oil
4127 2018-01-21 22:11:24 That's because, despite efforts to make us RELY on coal (like big oil blocked and mocked electric cars for so long) people choose clean air over pollution and cheaper green energy over corporate profit growth. Hooray for progress, clean air and the little guy (Earth too)!

4135 2018-01-21 22:10:42 Like "grilled sesame chicken wings" is fine - one assumes they used sesame oil and sesame seeds (and possibly soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and pepper paste).
4136 2018-01-21 22:10:37 Yeah right Fracking, Oil Rigs all over US shores, & de-regulating OSHA + Pollutions Standards.  Your a poor excuse for a human. All about Business buddies.
4137 2018-01-21 22:10:35 As Afrin has no oil, the US is happy to sacrifice it. The neo-fascist Erdogan wants a foreign war success, and the US's new Israel in NE Syria can't survive without Turkey.

NNPC as the ONLY importer is also rationing its importatn to curb losses

4164 2018-01-21 22:06:31 That’s old news. I don’t even recognize Saint Cloud MN any more. Dems started this crap in 2009 because “laborers were moving to ND to work in the oil patch” problem is they flooded an already stressed system with more unskilled, uneducated, UNMOTIVATED workers.
4165 2018-01-21 22:06:29 But it moves wind and solar into the retail market while research continues and prices fall.  Besides,  every KWH produced from solar means less oil that needs to be imported. Would rather see solar panels on roofs than body bags returning from the Middle East.

4169 2018-01-21 22:06:09 No, most doctors are not under “corporate control”.  Marijuana is not legal in my state, yet, but I have prescribed Marinol, and have recommended CBD oil to patients.
4170 2018-01-21 22:05:54 Funny how the 5th largest oil producing country in the world suffers from scarcity of petrol. What can be more shittier than that?
4171 2018-01-21 22:05:52 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Ps 23:4-5;KJV
4172 2018-01-21 22:05:49 coconut oil is so overrated lol
4173 2018-01-21 22:05:45 It was so worth the ten bucks! I got a glam glow mask sample, shampoo and conditioner samples, a NARS lipstick, Clinique eye cream, and like this skin oil stuff. I got something else I just can’t remember lol

4236 2018-01-21 21:57:16 Just don't go back out in the sun IN the coconut oil 
4237 2018-01-21 21:57:08 Nope.  Improving global economic performance is making the dollar weaken against other currencies by offering better return with improved risk ratios.  Oil is marginally reacting to the USD index, certainly not driving it.

4302 2018-01-21 21:46:50 Destroying all consumer protections in favor of business. And wanting to destroy National Monuments for oil and gas most destructive and despicable ever to be called president 
A grifter snake oil salesmen absolutely no integrity or dignity
4303 2018-01-21 21:46:42 From now the adjustment that stops the flow of oil in the pipeline will br known as the
Schumer shut off valve
4304 2018-01-21 21:46:34 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
4305 2018-01-21 21:46:34 can't? no, they WONT. They all refuse peace cause their goal is total supremacy colonization and control, for their zio nazi con banker big oil gang masters.
4306 2018-01-21 21:46:29 never put coconut oil on my skin because i knew about it clogging pores, but i did try it on my hair and it did NOTHING for it.
4307 2018-01-21 21:46:22 @MarcLobliner any ETA on EthiTech fish oil back in stock Marc?
4308 2018-01-21 21:46:21 Pay offs Pay offs for him and GOP you would think he would after they were found out selling Oil to North Korea
4309 2018-01-21 21:45:59 @e can all agree that there are problems w/ EIA company-level import data. I considered it questionable before posting but thought it was worth sharing anyway. I have since deleted the tweets. Thanks for all of your feedback.

4311 2018-01-21 21:45:57 It is Nickey Mouse when they over promised and invested badly. Not defending US but.Venezuela  exposed due to primary dependence on oil. Bad economic management
4312 2018-01-21 21:45:47 Stir together 1 pound bisque with 2 1/2 pints bluefish. Mix in Olive Oil. Roast. Serve on bread
4313 2018-01-21 21:45:35 I almost used my bottle of body oil instead of my lens solution the other day when I went to put my contacts in.

4315 2018-01-21 21:44:58 Yall do what yall see on media & that shit bugs tf putta me niggas been dying off oil sad but true. & now it means something
4316 2018-01-21 21:44:37 That's the thing. It's a mindset. That we might discover something big. Or simply be exploring another way that will let us know what will not work. But they expand the frontiers of knowledge for their societies. And keep pulling ahead. While we keep extracting oil

4318 2018-01-21 21:44:32 Nothing to do with hundreds of years of white rule;
1. extracting mineral wealth from the land like gold, oil, coltan, cobalt, all of which continues til today. 
2. Extracting human wealth, by kidnapping millions. 
3. Ruling for the benefit of their home nations
4319 2018-01-21 21:44:28 switching from creams to oils. squalane and rosehip oil saved my skin
4320 2018-01-21 21:44:27 I could rem some years back it was rated the most dangerous place in d world

4322 2018-01-21 21:44:11 I remember them doing this years ago too, for other games, when I lived there. The streets smelled like the grease and oil.

Kinda miss that city and all the weirdness. <3
4323 2018-01-21 21:43:29 So are you saying Palm oil is not vegetarian? Even though it's from a plant?
4324 2018-01-21 21:43:16 We have a president far more concerned with selling America to big oil, gas and real estate interests, and lying about everything, so, you know, this is just more hot air.
4325 2018-01-21 21:43:13 My skin loves coconut oil so I would have never known this.

4328 2018-01-21 21:42:55 Or oil changes..
4329 2018-01-21 21:42:43 Had to cut my baby bottle for lean so I can change my oil since I ain't got a funnel 
4330 2018-01-21 21:42:39 Oil the boobs up so much that you can see the TV in them, then you get to stare at the boobs the whole time hooray!
4331 2018-01-21 21:42:28 Anyone ever experienced rashes while on diet? What did you do? I'v finished all the palm oil in my house on my body.
4332 2018-01-21 21:42:24 Or crystals & snake oil!
4333 2018-01-21 21:42:01 Pls send cocnut oil vibes to my phone
4334 2018-01-21 21:41:53 They shoulda just left sippin oil to us H-Town niggas
4335 2018-01-21 21:41:53 I mean I put some sesame oil, seven spice, and a bit of soy in it, but I do that with all ramen including what I had in Japan.
4336 2018-01-21 21:41:52 Trying get that oil money lol
4337 2018-01-21 21:41:40 Taking every ounce of self respect I have left not to respond to the guy w a rig n oil in my tinder dms
4338 2018-01-21 21:41:39 But whos greed? Whos benefiting, certainly not the USA or Israelis. Saudi Oil is yesterday’s news. Desalination is today’s news. It is primordial tribalism & radical ideology that has destroyed the Middle East. America helped by removing the strongmen and made way for the Jihadi.
4339 2018-01-21 21:41:17 Okay sometime in the next week to week and a half, I am getting a vape with CBD oil for my anxiety. Give me suggestions if you have them. I need something simple, like a e-pen if possible.
4340 2018-01-21 21:41:15 I'm done with Pilot screwing me, cheapest oil now $19.95 a gallon just paid $20 for 2-gallons at LOVES. We're leaving the greedy Pilot/Flying-J for the truckstop that cares about truck drivers. Fleetcards will be shredded!!!
4341 2018-01-21 21:41:14 Thank you, for the suggestion. If it gets bad again, I’ll try it. Ostrich oil.

4343 2018-01-21 21:41:06 Nigeria needs an obsession with wealth creation. We seem to be more concerned with regulation, fees/levies, oil rents. Any small innovation like this, regulation. Crowdfunding for business is actually illegal in Nigeria. Flying drones requires a N100k+ fee

4345 2018-01-21 21:41:01 The NDP have done some good things but really all these good things appear to be for their own benefit. End corp donations. Good for NDP. C tax? Good for oil industry in terms of social license and pipelines. Not good for us. Converting private contracts to public. Who knows.

4347 2018-01-21 21:40:41 People put coconut oil on their body and face everyday and it works for them. Different strokes for different folks.

4351 2018-01-21 21:40:00 My dad got something in his eye while he was changing the oil on my car. My mom thought the tube of superglue were eyedrops and almost tried to flush his eye with it 
4352 2018-01-21 21:39:48 The best way to prepare tide pods: fry them in motor oil
4353 2018-01-21 21:39:35 Me too. I drain the oil then douse them in Frank's
4354 2018-01-21 21:39:14 But does she eat nightshade vegetables or cooked olive oil?
4355 2018-01-21 21:39:11 Oh, the things I just saw and heard at Dollar General in Oil City.
4356 2018-01-21 21:39:04 The last thing I want to view is an oil rig off shore or oil residue on our beaches!
4357 2018-01-21 21:39:01 That's why our parents & grandparents took cod liver oil. We've lost that knowledge.
4358 2018-01-21 21:39:00 That's Canadian oil. And yes, that oil provides jobs right here in the good ol' bacon loving US of A. So try telling those who depend on their jobs from this pipeline to feed their families that it's not needed.
4359 2018-01-21 21:38:58 Oozing with class.....oops that's just baby oil oozing

4361 2018-01-21 21:38:47 Do not pour it to the mens bodies and do not make any oil with the same formula. It is sacred and you are to consider it sacred. Exodus 30:32
4362 2018-01-21 21:38:30 NGA earned $120/barrel frm crude oil sale under GEJ regime
Billions of $ were stolen & moved offshore, no single investment for economic development
NGA imported every single thing we consumed even flowers
Our leaders stole n covered up stirring divide thru religion & ethnicity
4363 2018-01-21 21:38:25 Difference between American criminals and illegals is we are stuck with Americans. Illegals can and should be deported. Prob solved
4364 2018-01-21 21:38:24 And THEN the boiling oil?
4365 2018-01-21 21:38:18 Was looking more on "Beyond the Marne" and "Kaiserschlacht" since they are the only operations not included any of the campaigns beside "Oil of empires"

4367 2018-01-21 21:37:19 Protein treatment, hot oil treatment , and deep condition all in one day. Don’t know if it’s advised but, Baby, my hair feel brand new.
4368 2018-01-21 21:37:19 Anybody want to bet against the first human control battlefield meltdown being not regular military but instead contractors who don't understand the depths of the snake oil they've foisted?
4369 2018-01-21 21:37:15 Hey @Onnit @joerogan would your joint oil help for gout?
4370 2018-01-21 21:37:09 And yet @GillWru keeps tickling, poking you and adding oil to your hands in the hopes of making you let go. FT
4371 2018-01-21 21:37:03 Do we need oil? I don’t know the answer to that. I know we buy a lot from horrible people/countries. I wish planes, cars, trains, boats etc ran on water too but they don’t. Electric cars even use oil down the line. Something has to fuel powering the charge to that Prius.
4372 2018-01-21 21:36:49 What oil are you using
4373 2018-01-21 21:36:31 PRESIDENT Bone Spurs. Regulations for oil and chemical companies mean they are restricted from polluting our environment, regulations on banks protects the public. But of course a so called genius like yourself knows this. Or Do you
4374 2018-01-21 21:36:24 put coconut oil on and you’re dealing with oil residue nearly everywhere for half the day. 
4375 2018-01-21 21:36:23 True. The oil indust is paying into a fund that the bankrupt ones can just walk away from so it's not really a fund it's sort of a temp insurance that they can stop at any time. Env liabilities are a big prob. Not for industries. For taxpayers who pay for clean up. Unfortunate.
4376 2018-01-21 21:36:01 Olive branch ? If the Olive Trees knew the hands that planted them, Their Oil would become Tears.
4377 2018-01-21 21:35:50 Attraction cream and oil

4380 2018-01-21 21:35:24 Then 3 oz Rare seared Grass fed organic raised Sirloin, 1/4 Avacado sprinkled with Tunisian Olive oil
4381 2018-01-21 21:35:24 It's cool we're here to show otherwise.
4382 2018-01-21 21:35:24 FIRST - What about all the public space surrendered to: Waste/human waste/opencast mining/oil wells/tobacco farms/alcohol distillation/heavy industry/weapons manufacturing/war zones/nuclear testing/plutonium storage... Let's put things in order of priority.
4383 2018-01-21 21:35:02 Putting on the oil....lol....#slapshot
4384 2018-01-21 21:34:51 You and Trump? Yep.

4385 2018-01-21 21:34:39 Tea tree oil and just a basic mosturizer and the ahava mud mask is all I need for clear skin (well maybe my micellar water) but thats all and my skin is very clear and I only get spots if I eat unhealthy

4387 2018-01-21 21:34:17 The mia 1 clarisonic with any acne cleanser is amazing! I used to have natural redness and somehow, since i started using the clarisonic, the redness has decreased and any scars i have have gone away, also tea tree oil every now and then(prone to oily skin so i don’t use often)
4388 2018-01-21 21:34:11 DEEP now estimating some 4000 gallons of oil had spilled into the river.
4389 2018-01-21 21:34:00 Going to suck when he has to pop the hood and check the oil !

4391 2018-01-21 21:33:51 Yet @SenateMajLdr objects to military wage protection during the shut down. GOP hate the military when they’re not dying for oil or a political bargaining chip. #BoneSpurs
4392 2018-01-21 21:33:42 I'm back at the car wash that stole my oil pen last week. Lemme take all my loose change x charger out before they steal that too lol
4393 2018-01-21 21:33:41 @carolsdaughter Hi! Do you have any backstock of the Lemon Jojoba cuticle oil?
4394 2018-01-21 21:33:41 That developed nations this house legislate oil in developed countries
4395 2018-01-21 21:33:40 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4400 2018-01-21 21:33:17 Do you use oil to keep that skin smooth and hydrated?
4401 2018-01-21 21:33:16 I call bullshit on that sorry... The middle east is all about keeping it unstable to maintain oil interests plain and simple. If its all about protecting against totalitarianism why isnt NATO in Nigeria or Burma? Your theory is naive and gullible

4405 2018-01-21 21:32:38 Put that oil in your car
4406 2018-01-21 21:32:30  bye bye bye bye bye
4407 2018-01-21 21:32:14 Nice keep crude oil
In the ground
And crude men out of office.
4408 2018-01-21 21:32:11 A lot of us knew it at the time, but what could we do?
4409 2018-01-21 21:32:05 leave oil in the ground.
4410 2018-01-21 21:31:52 Actually, no it isn't lard. It was originally hydrogenated cottonseed oil. It's original purpose was to make candles with. When electricity became common, they needed a new use...thus, cooking with Crisco was born. It is no longer made with cottonseed oil, thank God.
4411 2018-01-21 21:31:44 Its very strange to think that a man who thinks nothing of breaking up families by deporting people is humane. Trump's entire theory of foreign policy was that "the Generals" should run it and the US should profit from wars ("take their oil").

4414 2018-01-21 21:30:59 Home made chips are better then the bagged stuff, and cheaper.
I use butter when I bake them, instead of oil.  They taste SOOO good.
4415 2018-01-21 21:30:59 The spill in the Gulf of Mexico has done so much damage they don't even know the extent yet-Big Oil is evil and sinister-they don't care.
4416 2018-01-21 21:30:57 I am extremely low on CBD oil 
4417 2018-01-21 21:30:54 Becoz #KRG don’t need to break his best relationship with Erdogan because its Oil pipelines go through Turkey!

4420 2018-01-21 21:30:11 There’s something special about anointing oil...
4421 2018-01-21 21:29:58 Why is taking my car to get an oil change always an all day event? #prius #dc #oilchange
4422 2018-01-21 21:29:53 Yes, one look at the map & one can see the plan. Turkish occupation up to Aleppo, an important crossroads, not to mention oil & gas pipeline route.
4423 2018-01-21 21:29:22 So high crude oil prices is a blessing and a curse in Nigeria?
4424 2018-01-21 21:29:03 Gas alright

4427 2018-01-21 21:28:37 Had a recent scare for the carrier bearing assembly on my '09 Escape when, doing a routine undercarrage check during an oil change, I found both mounting bolts backed off; the left one was three turns away from dropping out. Blue Loctite and a torque wrench ASAP fixed it.

4432 2018-01-21 21:28:12 almond oil and bio oil! I have a surgery scar on my neck and acne scars on my face and they’re virtually nonexistent now because of it.
4433 2018-01-21 21:27:59 Young & Living has a baby/toddler line of essential oils. I have a few for my son. I still dilute it before putting it on him bc I don't want the oil to be too overwhelming for him. Even if I use any other oil that's not "baby/toddler" I dilute it more!
4434 2018-01-21 21:27:37 As you can see, it's not. Alhamdulilah.
4435 2018-01-21 21:27:32 Definitely! But they stay as long as there is Oil or any target otherwise running up like Usian bollt

4478 2018-01-21 21:20:48 Ah a conspiracy theorist, how does that explain oil at $120? Shale oil and alternative energy sources reduced demand. Mickey mouse economics was the death of Venezuela as a solvent country

4495 2018-01-21 21:17:14 I wouldn't bother. Any argument about spending money with a supporter of a club bankrolled exclusively by a human rights abusing oil state is a little silly.

4497 2018-01-21 21:17:06 No I can't, oil plays a part, the land bridge Israel, Sinai, Suez seems a strategically important area to have influence. Yes I appreciate that Christianity and Judaism have their radicals, and no, it is not a myth for me,I read with fear Christ's and Mohammad's prophecies

4595 2018-01-21 21:04:31 Their end goal is still the same prolong the war to weaken Syria, removing Assad. Occupying as much land as possible to prevent Assad from gaining territory that might hold oil&gas.
4596 2018-01-21 21:04:27 Lord Lugard said "The North and the South of Nigeria are like oil and water, they will never mix". He amalgamated both regions in 1914.
4597 2018-01-21 21:04:25 So people now hunt in oil palm plantations? Wow!!!
4598 2018-01-21 21:04:20 Thank you girll, and the rosehip seed oil definitely. I also forgot to mention this but adding lemon essential oil to my moisturiser helped too
4599 2018-01-21 21:04:13 their rose hip oil is everything! I kinda want to try others

4602 2018-01-21 21:03:55 You’ve probably already tried it, but I’ve been using Tea Tree Oil for a few years (had horrible acne in my teens and still get pretty bad spots now), it’s helped huge. It’s not a quick fix, but helps. 
4603 2018-01-21 21:03:44 When will you release the water powered engine that you bought in the 70’s and locked away due to your business being in cahoots with the oil firms and petrochemical industry?
4604 2018-01-21 21:03:42 Is he not putting up oil rig pictures anymore?
4605 2018-01-21 21:03:21 U.K. and USA need to invest much more in renewable energy, not because of global warming but because we'll be getting screwed as oil becomes more and more scarce.

*Redirected* where?
4608 2018-01-21 21:03:06 I don’t need the oil like that. I sip it one day and the next I’m straight.

4632 2018-01-21 20:59:09 America will go metric when the oil companies figure out they can sell gasoline by the litre and and no one can recognize an even worse rip-off.
4633 2018-01-21 20:58:55 Get peppermint oil and a ceramic diffuser

4635 2018-01-21 20:58:50 I found another oil lamp at this cool metaphysics, New Age, Wiccan or whatever shop & poured some kinda Arabian oil in it -- I'm in love.
4636 2018-01-21 20:58:26 Order an oil diffuser off Amazon & mix some oregano oil or juniper berry oil in it. You’ll feel brand new.
4637 2018-01-21 20:58:09 Always blaming it on the Dems, when in fact YOU did not make a budget 6mo ago. You gave too much to the Military. Why do the tax payers have to pay for the "World Police"? why dont your Oil friends pay for the Military, they are "protecting" their Companies aboard

Goddamn am I wrong. :D

4643 2018-01-21 20:57:40 Are you spraying your hair with water  or a water/oil mix daily? I’ve noticed it helps out a lot when you do.
4644 2018-01-21 20:57:32 i need body oil or whatever it's called because regular lotion irritates my back.
4645 2018-01-21 20:57:22 Wrong. Republicans should have funded government, CHIP, DACA before passing tax bill trillions in welfare to corporate welfare queens Apple, Facebook, Google, Comcast, banks, oil, coal, prescription drugs, electricity, etc. IMF Externalities
4646 2018-01-21 20:57:19 @SenateDems why did y’all vote against funding the government?? Need 9 votes in the senate from Dems! What happened? Why are y’all selling snake oil and lying about who controlled this vote! Nuclear option should be coming next!

4650 2018-01-21 20:56:59 “Oil expresses perfectly the eternal human dream of wealth achieved through lucky accident, through a kiss of fortune and not by sweat, anguish, hard work. In this sense oil is a fairy tale and, like every fairy tale, it is a bit of a lie.” <- s/oil/bitcoin/ ;-)

4659 2018-01-21 20:55:19 Quick point to add. If what Leave campaign promised came true, I’d be delighted. But I don’t think it will; that’s the problem. Just snake oil sold by people too rich to care about real people.

4671 2018-01-21 20:53:59 This happens to me a lot, try using some coconut oil to soothe it,it helps me. Moisturisers with aloe Vera in are helpful too x

4682 2018-01-21 20:51:56 I thought that way as a kid. Then my eyesight got messed up by strabismus. Glasses are fun, but beware. Your hair leaves smudges when it brushes against them. Paper towels scratch the lenses. Dust builds up on them, and even blinking can leave bits of skin oil on them.
4683 2018-01-21 20:51:46 That's  a beautiful and edgy space pirate right there. Is the mist blood, motor oil, or liquid gummi ship? It's what the people want
4684 2018-01-21 20:51:28 Truffle oil is delicious.  Especially in macaroni and cheese!  To quote a very old commercial, “Try it you’ll like it!” 
(Although I hope the results aren’t the same as the character in the commercial.)
4685 2018-01-21 20:51:26 Could not describe the Cali bro-ness of this Lyft driver rn. Waxing poetic about electric cars, hypothesizing that “Rockefeller and his boys” wanted oil which is why people still drive gas vehicles.
4686 2018-01-21 20:51:18 Not my place to really say, but their past with social media is a “tell-all” for me. I may  have to “support”/buy from them only for their maracujia oil until I find a replacement though. Dupes??

4690 2018-01-21 20:50:33 Can clog pores and make you break out. I've heard it's okay to remove make up (then wash your face with a cleanser with water base). But as a facial oil is not very recommended.

4696 2018-01-21 20:49:04 This administration needs to bury its head in shame. The shame is not that there's a fuel scarcity; the shame is: we are a so called "oil- producing" nation. #HowDifficultCanItBe

4699 2018-01-21 20:48:39 This makes the United States government a dictator. The sole reason we are in Niger is at the behest of gas and oil companies.

Then there is our history of overthrowing numerous governments to access gas & oil. We overthrew the Iraqian gov twice to access their's.

4718 2018-01-21 20:45:15 Just because you have oily skin doesn’t mean you should strip your face of all the oil!!! And using oil on your face when you have oily skin isn’t a bad thing (just maybe don’t use coconut oil)
4719 2018-01-21 20:45:12 The illegals send a ton of money back to Mexico. Mexico makes more money on illegals sending money back than they do on selling oil. 

That doesn't even count the illegals who falsely"claim" to have 10 dependents living there and get money from the IRS as a "Child tax credit".

One of the most powerful Industries has huge stake in it - oil.

4728 2018-01-21 20:44:06 definitely applying an oil with my foundation, i have really dry skin and it helps a lot

4736 2018-01-21 20:43:20 I do.  But I don't just give my hard earned wages away to some snake oil salesman so that he (or she) can live in tax free luxury.  And I have a lot better things to do Sundays than listen to bullshit.
4737 2018-01-21 20:43:09 Michael McDowell rotates his tires every oil change

4742 2018-01-21 20:42:59 I would never put coconut oil on my face.
4743 2018-01-21 20:42:51 Using oil serums for oily skin
4744 2018-01-21 20:42:29 Biggest scam
4745 2018-01-21 20:42:27 Not from hypocrites like you and the rest of the snake oil salesmen.
4746 2018-01-21 20:42:17 CBD oil has been such a godsend for me, holy cats.
4747 2018-01-21 20:42:13 When I’m ready to plov I chunk up 2 aubergine, drizzle with oil and chilli flakes & roast for 45 mins (I often do this at same time as lamb cos oven is on & I love aubergine with lamb). I then fry a couple of onions with at least 1 whole head of garlic 2/?
4748 2018-01-21 20:42:13 3 sellouts and a snake oil salesman go into a bar ....
4749 2018-01-21 20:41:59 I literally told my mom yesterday I was sleeping in and not leaving my house today. And she calls me at 9 am to yell at me to get my oil changed.
4750 2018-01-21 20:41:58 Baby oil gets the job done for me .. 
4751 2018-01-21 20:41:47 Ya mcm can’t do his own oil changes

4763 2018-01-21 20:40:44 Saudi Arabia’s top oil official—the de facto leader of OPEC—gave the most explicit call for the 14-nation cartel and 10 nonmember allies to keep supporting the oil market into 2019
4764 2018-01-21 20:40:38 U guyz find wrong in everything... instead of criticize anyone, oil ur own machine...
4765 2018-01-21 20:40:22 Who gone buy me some beard oil?
4766 2018-01-21 20:40:21 What are the odds that the Las Palmas groundsman poured some oil on the playing surface before the game? Whatever the odds though, seems to have worked the magic, it even led to a slip of the tongue from Paulista. Sounds like on of those witty @DriscollFC intros
4767 2018-01-21 20:40:08 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
4768 2018-01-21 20:40:07 Family Nutrition: General Mills #Bugles this January? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
4769 2018-01-21 20:40:03 Yeah... instantly dry and then wipe it down with a paper towel and vegetable oil or crisco lol light coat tho..
4770 2018-01-21 20:39:55 Changed the oil on the Durango finally!
4771 2018-01-21 20:39:33 my face really breaking out from all that oil at my job
4772 2018-01-21 20:39:33 Thanks Chuba, the man is quick to say people are panic buying because he benefits from the government that cannot address the ill that is in the oil sector. U need apologize to him. Does he even know the official price of fuel?
4773 2018-01-21 20:39:31 I want to Oil wrestle!!!!
4774 2018-01-21 20:39:05 I’m open to new things. Not like most guys.

4778 2018-01-21 20:38:30 Income is fine, not  a problem, only reason City dont have debt is oil sugar daddy dropped 1.5 billion in city accounts
4779 2018-01-21 20:38:23 If your hair is dry and brittle, mix coconut oil, olive oil, and a few drops of tea tree oil, heat it up, and pour it onto your hair completely saturating every strand starting on the ends. Let it sit for like an hour, wash it out.... thank me later.

4787 2018-01-21 20:36:47 The best thing about @Padella_Pasta is not the amazing pasta, but the fresh bread and olive oil. Real life-affirming quality. Fabulous stuff.
4788 2018-01-21 20:36:35 Ok so sometimes if your skin is naturally a little dry, it will like... overcompensate and produce way too much oil. I had kind of the same thing going on and I found that making sure my skin stayed hydrated REALLY helped
4789 2018-01-21 20:36:27 Oil of Olay face wash. I pick it up from the dollar store works like magic
4790 2018-01-21 20:36:25 Efficient local reprocessing systems could be installed now.

Small scale technologies exist now to turn plastic garbage into building materials, long life fence posts, roadfill, petrol, heating oil .....

Now.
4791 2018-01-21 20:36:14 Add Mirin to your veggies when sautéing them. It makes kale much tastier. Unless carmelized onion / garlic is integral to your dish’s taste, sautée them with some water. Removing even just a bit of oil helps with the health factor
4792 2018-01-21 20:35:38 I worked with a great many Kurds.  I think the collective assessment is brilliant (as usual).  I regret, however, that the resolution now lies beyond American influence.  The Kurdish future may now be at the mercy of Iraqi government oil revenues and the reemergence of...
4793 2018-01-21 20:35:23 yes i use hair oil for my face
4794 2018-01-21 20:35:22 don't have enough olive oil to make ma cobb's. going back to bed, trying again tomorrow.
4795 2018-01-21 20:35:07 Soybean oil users want better functionality. You want premium beans with competitive yield. High oleic soybeans are the answer! #plantHOS
4796 2018-01-21 20:35:06 Hi! I find supplements don’t work that much, I tried hair burst but my hair has come leaps and bounds doing natural things. What tends to work is using no heat at all, regular trims and coconut oil on the ends

4798 2018-01-21 20:34:53 where the fuck is my oil
4799 2018-01-21 20:34:50 I don't see baby oil and a dildo here
4800 2018-01-21 20:34:44 Omfg what!!! Coconut oil is not supposed to get that hot!!
4801 2018-01-21 20:34:41 Kinda like adding allowing oil drilling in Alaska wildlife refuge in the tax bill isn't it?
4802 2018-01-21 20:34:36 Lube or oil? Which is best for your cock?
4803 2018-01-21 20:34:29 I agree with all of you about that but there are very few choices and most of you are very down On fracking so if there's no oil drilling offshore, no Fracking, Wind and solar has not reached its potential, then what?
4804 2018-01-21 20:34:12 Hi Lauren, my 10yo has autism and used to get migraines every so often. I have been using essential oils and they have been a godsend. He has not had one in a while. He will now ask for oil when he feels symptomatic. He has seasonal allergies as well so it's helped with that also
4805 2018-01-21 20:34:11 They can't keep"supporting"the oil market over $70/barrel without yielding money to the growing US fracking yield!
4806 2018-01-21 20:33:51 Agree with both your points there. “Christian” countries scrapping over oil and trying to bomb democracy into the Middle-East hasn’t helped either, mind.

Plus, I don’t for one minute believe Hopkins practices any form of Christianity properly. She’s just full of hot air.
4807 2018-01-21 20:33:36 I’m convinced that a majority of the issues we seek treatment for can most likely be cured with coconut oil.
4808 2018-01-21 20:33:29 I am currently soaking in the new green bath oil of which I forgot the name! But love it :)
4809 2018-01-21 20:33:11 Honestly planned to change my car's oil today buuut last night happened. 
Just got out of bed :^)
4810 2018-01-21 20:33:10 I need to get my car cleaned and an oil change.
4811 2018-01-21 20:33:05 Soooo i finally realised what’s happening with my scalp... and eyebrows, nose, ears... stupid dry air and that crappy processed oil I used to fry stuff the other day set off my seborrheic dermatitis.  *sigh* autoimmune dramas open you to a world of other dramas
4812 2018-01-21 20:33:03 OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING PLAN. But, not in one location. Coastal, each of our OPEN ocean to exposed to toxic chemicals. We all have our disagreements, but nothing is established on a "progressive" level if this shutdown continues. If a "C.R." IS. What this President wants to sign
4813 2018-01-21 20:32:32 Your loyalty is misguided daesh oil was purchased by your pres. Maybe still is. The trucks were traced and the drivers were interviewed.

4819 2018-01-21 20:31:27 Whisky export duty. BBC weather maps. HS2 costs. Aircraft carriers without planes. Oil is just a bonus. We'll just walk away from debt. Scotland pays into the treasury and gets pocket money back. We'll remain in the EU after indy. They stole oil territory in '99. Etc etc.

4824 2018-01-21 20:30:49 @tirechoice we have a major problem I would like to discuss. The guys at my location left the oil filter loose on the last change 12/18 and my engine almost blew up, leaking everywhere, there may be further damage. I have pictures/sticker and receipt. Please DM.
4825 2018-01-21 20:30:39 The pipeline may win their interest....but first they will see if there is another way to get their hands on it. Like UK BP did in Kirkuk w the oil.
4826 2018-01-21 20:30:36 I was about to ask if you saw any Olive Oil in the basket. 
4827 2018-01-21 20:30:31 Stir fry in sesame oil until the slime caramelizes, add soy sauce, serve with rice. Thank me later
4828 2018-01-21 20:30:08 I finally broke down & copped one of those oil pens & I’m out here spending almost half of what I was spending on weed a month lol. Jeff Sessions best not try to take this away from me.
4829 2018-01-21 20:29:56 #frightenly similar?  You avoid the differences - as oil and water are.  Your intellect is frightenly similar to a baboon's though different.  Your inability to recognize the importance of "differences" is stunning.
4830 2018-01-21 20:29:55 Is this why when I would put coconut oil on my legs they would just feel oily all day? Never felt moisturized

4847 2018-01-21 20:27:59 He’s a snake oil salesmen. Greed has overtaken him and most of his colleagues.
4848 2018-01-21 20:27:55 Aramco is WAY bigger than Exxon in terms of power in the Middle East #IMHO but as global petroleum power centers they probably rival each other - Exxon is a direct descendant of Standard Oil.

In terms of influence on the #USA I’d say they more rival each other domestically.

4852 2018-01-21 20:26:55 I thought everybody knew: Bush, Cheney and the rest of the oil-soaked NeoCons didn't invade Iraq because Saddam was a brutal thug. The NeoCons wanted a clear shot at Iraqi oil, so they out-thugged him. Now they're cashing in.
4853 2018-01-21 20:26:30 364821N/0365902E was the coordinate that given as "Isis oil centre" meanwhile it was empty land(no building). Trucks weren't at Turkish border, Syrian town which is much far away from border and have nothing to do Turkey
4854 2018-01-21 20:26:20 Yeah, current thoughts after 5 days of CBD oil. Definitely slightly less concentrated of a dose than I’d like for myself. However, it is completely worth it esp since I got mine from a local shop & I feel so so much better holy hell.
4855 2018-01-21 20:26:02 It's incredible that the remake of Dynasty managed to turn a show about an evil and corrupt family of American oil tycoons into anti-Venezuelan propaganda in less than one season.
4856 2018-01-21 20:25:58 Me either!!! I started adding Koshed salt, pepper, a little garlic and olive oil!
4857 2018-01-21 20:25:49 I decided to give CBD oil a try for my fibro. Just ordered supplements, and a vape for flares. 

I'm optimistic - at the very least, I have nothing to lose.
4858 2018-01-21 20:25:39 Super late to this party but I now moisturize  my face with rosehip oil every night and my skin is PRISTINE! It’s a little lighter than coconut oil so really balancing for your face if you have uneven bits of oily and dryness. Also helps so much with redspots!
4859 2018-01-21 20:25:34 I gotta go get an oil change in the am! 
4860 2018-01-21 20:25:28 Lol a poll with few Scots & loaded with folk from the south...those that don't read tabloid rags know that without Scotland's oil/wealth, they're doomed, & the tabloid swallowers have been brainwashed to hate us...pointless, poor propaganda
4861 2018-01-21 20:25:15 i put coconut oil in my eyebrows but it somehow got into my eyes and now i can’t see

4863 2018-01-21 20:24:57 Everyone knows that Assad's desire 2 subjugate the Syrian Kurdish people has become an understanding between the Russians & the Turks to unleash the Turkish army
So:tell the traitor of American nation, Tillerson, to shut up and Continue the oil business with Putin silently.
4864 2018-01-21 20:24:49 Going to the beaches & watching sea otters in the waves & kelp beds & we have had WHALES ()  in the past few years.  They'll go away if GOP forces oil drilling there in those places. The drilling itself disrupts sea life (been proven)  & you know I'm sure how horrible oil...
4865 2018-01-21 20:24:28 how come we aren't bolivarian, we have oil, gas, water, military, and technology but these streets are meaner than a chicago winter
4866 2018-01-21 20:24:21 Science doesn’t work like that. The burden of proof is on the person making the claim. 

Like the supposed miracle of Holy Fire, we know is just phosphorous dipped in oil. The church commits fraud to deceive the gullible.

4874 2018-01-21 20:23:11 Looks delicious. Try with garlic & dry sherry. Marinade  pheasant in 1 table sp oil, 1 tea spn salt & 4 crushed garlic cloves for 1hr. Fry pheasant until browned. Remove. In pan fry 4 sliced garlic cloves add 200ml sherry. Reduce. Add chicken & bay leaves, cook covered 15 min.

4882 2018-01-21 20:22:01 We have problem in this country.
We have oil we import fuel,
We have tomatoes we import tomato paste,
We have different varieties of fruit we still import fruit juice.
We have serious problem
4883 2018-01-21 20:22:00 There will be Robot Rights activists in the future. 

It's absurd.

Something that isn't biological isn't alive.

Cells.

A robot isn't a miracle. 

It's parts, circuitry, wires, & oil.

Humans are cells, nerves, bones, meat, & blood.

What is not alive deserves no rights.
4884 2018-01-21 20:21:57 There’s very few things I say I can’t do. Getting oil stains outta our drive way is definitely one of them. Why does the boyfriend have to be gone right now?!

4886 2018-01-21 20:21:46 I believe it is the top universities for PGE such as UT and Texas A&M that enable this domination of the oil and gas market. Discoveries in the US such as the Haynesville shale are constantly proving this by increasing oil production within our country. #PGE301
4887 2018-01-21 20:21:45 Sooo I've stayed up too late and sat too long at my PC trying to put together a blog post, now I'm dizzy. So now I'm in bed with White Flower oil on my temples and eating crackers like an old person.

4891 2018-01-21 20:21:13 how offensive to drive a confederacy down our oil fields
4892 2018-01-21 20:20:45 How Trump conducts our foreign policy. If you have oil it's Rex. If you are rich and in a position to be extorted to pay off a terrible investment, that's Jared. And if you think the Holy Wars ended w/o a final determination about which white people God gave the world to, Pence.
4893 2018-01-21 20:20:44 That's pretty childish . . . your article is 5 months old. And an utterly stupid argument.  Trump is elected president but he really wants to be an NFL owner. I'm sure he and Kraft get along like oil and water.
4894 2018-01-21 20:20:40 My sticker on my car has been dead for over a month & I’m 600 miles overdue for my oil change, I should really start paying attention to stuff
4895 2018-01-21 20:20:38 That's why 45 wants Norwegians to migrate to US so our lives will be better. They'll bring their 32 hrs work weeks, unions, universal healthcare and a pension fund for every citizen paid for by oil profits. Can't wait for them  socialists to come on over!
4896 2018-01-21 20:20:38 I hate them! I'm so tired of them ignoring us and telling what we don't want despite the abundance of contrary evidence! Tired of our politicians representing only the oil/gas and chemical companies.
4897 2018-01-21 20:20:17 It's like an ostrich: sticks the head in the sand. Will the oil and gas that Quebec still needs for many years, be "cleaner" because other, and less developed countries, produces and ship it to Quebec? Smells like hypocrisy...
4898 2018-01-21 20:20:16 Hey! It's s great make up remover, so it'll clean the face but you need to use cotton pads to wipe it off as water doesn't wash oil. X

4903 2018-01-21 20:19:46 It is so sad that #Geology etc graduates in #Nigeria can't seem to get jobs... a country that has large reserves of crude and an oil industry etc. The country has failed its youth. #sodiscouraging

4931 2018-01-21 20:15:08 Think of all the oil the hoagie shops will be saving. It’s the economy boost we didn’t know we needed. 

It just sucks that my pole dancing will be impacted.

4964 2018-01-21 20:10:57 I travelled to Colorado 2 years ago, to turn cannabis oil in to a vape. It went well, but we needed  a product available worldwide where THC is illegal. We’ve managed to extract the THC, and have a product for adults and children.

4996 2018-01-21 20:06:08 You are working hard to demoralize your staff (which makes sense since you hate them and their dedication to the NPS mission) and to pimp the parks for Daddy @realDonaldTrump and your oil & uranium buddies.

4998 2018-01-21 20:05:26 He suggested we should have kept Iraq's oil and took credit for lowering the number of CIA fallen from 29 to 28 after an attendee corrected him.

5010 2018-01-21 20:03:26 Grape seed oil is AMAZING. I used it when I was like 14 and my pimple scars literally disappeared in two days. Then I ran out and everyone told me to use coconut oil and that shit did NOTHING. It’s great for my hair and das about it lol
5011 2018-01-21 20:03:23 Sounds like a good time to grease the hallways with olive oil

5014 2018-01-21 20:03:05 Olive oil needs to be x2 daily for about 2 weeks and then if necessary go get them syringed at.your local gp !!! Make sure when you putting olive oil in your lay to the side and really let the oil go all the way in before putting a bit of cotton wool with vaseline on in your ear
5015 2018-01-21 20:03:04 I hope the Jaguars get precisely 1000 sacks and make fun of Tom Brady’s dumb haircut and makes him go cry to his snake oil selling Ponzi scheme health guru
5016 2018-01-21 20:02:44 Yes, it IS tough!!! I'm trying to remember the name of the one I was  stuck on last night for a long time. I think it was called Oil Drum Alley. Finally did beat it, but I couldn't make it to a save point, so I shall have to beat it again...
5017 2018-01-21 20:02:43 I know a girl that took castor oil at 32 weeks...and had her baby that early. So yeah, some people do actually WANT their child to be premature. Lol
5018 2018-01-21 20:02:40 I use their coconut and hibiscus line ( orange ) for styling, the Jamaican black castor oil one for washing and leave in !

5020 2018-01-21 20:02:32 “Domestics are so much easier to work on than foreign cars!” Alright, come compare removing the oil filter from my 2014 Kia Soul to my wife’s 1999 Ford F-150! I thought the Kia’s was hard, but the Ford’s is IMPOSSIBLE to remove by hand! Or with a strap wrench.
5021 2018-01-21 20:02:26 Amen sister.  Snake oil salesmen reporting a pipeline to G-d's ear are a scourge of our society.  These people have an answer to everything as long as you keep the collection plate full.
5022 2018-01-21 20:02:14 That’s the excuse of a child. And people actually believe his snake oil.
5023 2018-01-21 20:02:03 Should have been little oil, not too much oil, like you want to fry egg.
should be flat, not your sweet akara 
5024 2018-01-21 20:01:45 This dude made a video making Hennessy fried chicken... I'm disturbed. Wasted a whole bottle in place of using oil

Bon appétit 
5030 2018-01-21 20:01:08 It's oil change day so I'm sitting in the waiting room all caught up on Twitter, AMA 

(If you don't know what to ask I love answering silly questions about my monsters)
5031 2018-01-21 20:00:58 burning the midnight oil till depletion and terpaksa construct npp to light up the incoming nights zzz
5032 2018-01-21 20:00:57 FWIW the majority of stories, headlines etc that I see today (including statements by OPEC and oil ministers) are clearly using peak oil to mean a peak in demand
5033 2018-01-21 20:00:50 Doh! Don't do research on a phone. Flicking between apps is not optimal. One reads the wrong number! There's 135kg of oil in a barrel, 118kg of carbon which then becomes 432.71 kg of CO2.

Crikey.
5034 2018-01-21 20:00:47 I love Hunter's mom. She's sending Hunter home with some clove oil so I can numb the fuck outta my wisdom teeth. 
5035 2018-01-21 20:00:35 My drumming isn't as rusty as I thought.
Hanging my half moon tambourine on frame before attaching the top rubber pads was a good move.
Just got to oil and fix the drum pedal more securely
5036 2018-01-21 20:00:26 Not made them no. But as they were covered in oil & marker pen I cleaned, sanded & waxed them 
5037 2018-01-21 20:00:19 I’ve got an amazing home base, people I can count on, endless possibilities, and a man who can cook while I check my own oil. #contentbutnotdone

5039 2018-01-21 20:00:07 Ugh thankgosh, if you have acne prone skin i wouldn’t put coconut oil anywhere near your face
5040 2018-01-21 20:00:00 I'm trying out this coconut oil business this week. Wish me luck lol
5041 2018-01-21 19:59:59 I laughed and loved the part where his wife was playing pit crew "Bring it in Bring it in You are leaking oil"
5042 2018-01-21 19:59:56 pill-free headache cure!!! : 
•3-5 drops magnesium oil
•4 fresh mint leaves, crushed
•aloe vera gel
mix the oil & crushed mint leaves together in small bowl. add just enough aloe to make a poultice. apply to temples & cover eyes w cold compress. voila!
5043 2018-01-21 19:59:19 My parents started giving my dog fish oil pills to help with his dry skin.
Now I just wish he would stop yawning near me because his breath smells like rotting death. 
5044 2018-01-21 19:59:17 lmaooo sweet akara 
did you put too much oil ?
5045 2018-01-21 19:59:09 Not sure? I might lay it out so, it can   handle a lot of oil. Or I might put a different surface on it if it had one.
5046 2018-01-21 19:59:07 Is it possible that the most common use and meaning of “peak oil” has evolved from a time we were worried about running out, to a time that a decline in demand seems to be the bigger threat to status quo?
5047 2018-01-21 19:59:05 @jerseymikes 

Giant club sub, Mike’s Way. White bread. Light oil & vinegar. 

Just in case you ever decide to reward lifetime supplies anytime soon. #YouHaveNotCauseYouAskNot
5048 2018-01-21 19:58:47 Yes that's a good point.. sometimes I compare or equal the issue of saudi ARAMCO to Exxon in terms of their weight and magnitude as power brokers and oil majors and proximity to the US government ..
5049 2018-01-21 19:58:40 I just massaged peppermint oil onto my face, followed it with @SisleyParisUsa Black Rose Cream Mask, and sat in front of a fan. Not only does my skin feel amazing, but this is might be the clearest I’ve ever breathed in my life. #SelfCare is the best care
5050 2018-01-21 19:58:31 @ @American_Heart  says no to 1 tiny tablespoon of coconut oil has a whopping 12 grams of saturated fat, while the same serving of olive oil has only one gram, Food & Wine reports.

5053 2018-01-21 19:57:42 Why would they need to fire the Rockets into Egypt? Egypt does not control their water electricity oil food or anything else Israel does.

5056 2018-01-21 19:57:10 It literally says that it is a trend in America.
5057 2018-01-21 19:56:54 Olive oil helped me out!

5059 2018-01-21 19:56:46 I have those dreams too. They also include offering him gold and oil instead of food and drink. That’s what he wants for future generations.
5060 2018-01-21 19:56:39 Cheers to you, S.L. Great work. In my hometown of Bradford, Pa., we knew all about Aliquippa. They were steel. We were oil. Football served as a rallying point, as did other sports. I look forward to reading more of your work.
5061 2018-01-21 19:56:37 I got my ass up and went and got my oil change like I was supposed to. Good job Shawna 
5062 2018-01-21 19:56:37 Well we agree on many things Bubba but not the price of #Oil ......   Enjoy your football.
5063 2018-01-21 19:56:28 i cook with sesame seed oil when i cook chicken and salmon cause its healthier but that stuff is like $8 a bottle soo i use it wisely
5064 2018-01-21 19:56:10 The White House chef prepares the potato kugel with olive oil instead of schmaltz.  No, this is not a milkekh meal, it's for "health reasons".  Are you allowed to throw a punch on Shabbos?
5065 2018-01-21 19:55:58 Whenever it is needs to be stopped. Someone needs to step in with a coconut oil mask at least.
5066 2018-01-21 19:55:55 Rofl I probably should because I have class in 5 hours but I can’t sleep 
5067 2018-01-21 19:55:51 I need an oil change 
5068 2018-01-21 19:55:39 This piece seems to mix short-  and long-term prospects. Note the comment near the end "Does that mean oil prices are poised to plummet? Probably not, unless shale producers ramp up output again. " That refers to the next few years and I'm not sure if there's a reason they won't.
5069 2018-01-21 19:55:37 No. It's about getting the oil and gas industry off the hook in terms of liabilities. I imagine they will all work away legally. A moonscape will be left. We will pay for the polluter pay liabilities. All over Canada this is how it is.@JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @SPhillipsAB

5072 2018-01-21 19:54:40 Too bad Trump won’t pay the military, but that’s what you get from a draft-dodging snake oil salesman whose never held a position for more than a year.
5073 2018-01-21 19:54:39 My 2018 aesthetic: accidental hot oil burns and wounds from friends’ pets who weren’t trying to hurt me.
5074 2018-01-21 19:54:35 Terrible hiring, typical crap Oilers franchise pulls year after year. Never worked then, won’t work now. What a circus the Oil organization is
5075 2018-01-21 19:54:25 my boyfriend turns on my heated blanket & oil diffuser and be knockedt, he really think he me.
5076 2018-01-21 19:54:22 ima keep it real with you chief, coconut oil really ain’t ALL that
5077 2018-01-21 19:54:19 She only wanted me to feed kibble. No meat, no fish oil, and definitely not raw. She also wanted me to switch my food to her food which is actually not as good as the kibble I currently feed my dog. 
Not to mention the tone and way she spoke to me was unprofessional.
5078 2018-01-21 19:54:09 I've had Vicks on my chest and sniffing the olbas oil. No wonder I'm single

5110 2018-01-21 19:49:17 I believe if you look at the origins of #Aramco from back when it was known as the Arab American Oil Company you might find interesting information on how Big Oil & other ‘smaller’ supermajors offer indirect technical & political support for the Saudis in petroleum affairs.
5111 2018-01-21 19:49:09 Yeah same, I use a blend of coconut oil with vitamin E and and sunflower serum oil
5112 2018-01-21 19:49:04 Oil continue the upside until the aramco ipo. Post that should enter a correction phase again.

5115 2018-01-21 19:48:47 Unfortunately, Oil and Gas is no personal/individual business like the Cattle Rearing business.....both are incomparable.

5120 2018-01-21 19:48:20 Everyone's issues are different but for me I pretty much cleared up once I started taking fish oil, zinc, and magnesium. Too lazy to do what everyone says and eat right so I just pop the pills.
5121 2018-01-21 19:48:10 I was on a roll cooking...then...ran out of oil. Now I have to go to the store. Dangit.
5122 2018-01-21 19:48:07 I remember the article for this Basically after an oil spill they needed to soak out the oil from the penguins skin so theyre given sweaters
5123 2018-01-21 19:48:02 My cousin ft’d me for tips on her skincare routine. She said everyone told her put coconut oil on her face & she was breaking out so bad, but didn’t know why.
5124 2018-01-21 19:48:00 Thanks Pahi for booking a Oil And Filter Change with #Fiix for your Toyota!  #Ajax #Toronto #Tech
5125 2018-01-21 19:47:48 Poor person never gave anyone else a job.When Big corps make $, Libs whine that they are greedy&yell TAX, TAX & more TAX.But when those same companies lost a fortune because of Dodd/Frank & oil $$ collapsing,there profits disappeared but higher taxes stayed.
5126 2018-01-21 19:47:45 Never since Olive Oil’s Father has there been someone less deserving of an apology
5127 2018-01-21 19:47:43 I'm still waiting for #BPC to drill. Wake me up when that ever happens.
5128 2018-01-21 19:47:39 Tea tree oil is a life changer.

5130 2018-01-21 19:47:01 Her death is a bummer, but I LOVE Armus. He is a SENTIENT, SUPER EMO PUDDLE OF OIL.
5131 2018-01-21 19:46:59 As for energy prices going up, well they have haven't they? Fuel shot up thanks to the £ tanking. Oil is priced in dollars. Inflation up means all prices are up. And as for being back of the queue for trade deals. We're standing all alone, there isn't even a queue to wait in.
5132 2018-01-21 19:46:48 When used in massage it can help with muscle aches and pains, always mix with a base oil, yes we do sell @BetterYou_Ltd oral turmeric spray, this is superior curcumin absorption and it’s absorbed directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system.
5133 2018-01-21 19:46:36 Why do so many ppl get their oil change on Sunday
5134 2018-01-21 19:46:18 لان هذي الطريقه في الحسبه تعالج حاجه الشركات للسواق خصوصاً الشركات اللي اعتمادها الكلي على التوصيل وعندها شفتات عمل وتختلف الحاجه للسواق حسب اوقات الذروه والعاديه... لان السايق ما يقدر يشتغل من 7 الصبح الى 12 الليل
5135 2018-01-21 19:46:11 I've been alive 50 years. One of these popes in not like the others.
5136 2018-01-21 19:46:07 Totally hear you. My doc won't even allow CBD oil. He encouraged me to have an SI fusion and have the screws from my lumbar fusion removed. i think the SI fusion has made me worse. i walk with a cane 55% of the time. The pain gets so unbearable..
5137 2018-01-21 19:45:55 Ok, I just finished the #StarTrekTheNextGeneration ep #SkinOfEvil where an evil Oil slick called Armus kills Tasha Yar.  As a child, I cried, now I'm just left with mourning the POTENTIAL of her character. How could I elicit any feelings when she HAD NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT?
5138 2018-01-21 19:45:54 I always thought it was religions but now think just cultures, land and oil are enough.
5139 2018-01-21 19:45:36 I didn't know you could cook with tumeric oil hmmmmm
5140 2018-01-21 19:45:33 I put too much damn heat protectant oil in my hair now my shit look greasy af like I just didn't shower
5141 2018-01-21 19:45:31 Bloody businesses; creating jobs for people, helping oil the wheels of the UK economy and paying their taxes. Who do they think they are? They just need to put up all their prices in order to cope post Brexit and pass those costs onto the consumer - ie you and me 
5142 2018-01-21 19:45:28 Firstly, many of us do and secondly (the idiot) our pensioner boom was for many decades a working-and-paying-tax-boom. If governments have mislaid those billions it ain't our fault. (By the way why is UK the world's only poor oil producer? Where did those trillions go?).
5143 2018-01-21 19:45:27 $80 oil change 
5144 2018-01-21 19:45:22 Environment. The next issue is poor initial wood treatment & maintenance. This is where older windows have an advantage, in that they were originally treated with (linseed) oil based paints. The beauty of these paints is that they are absorbed into the outer layer of the wood...
5145 2018-01-21 19:45:18  I wish! Oil field is Booming out here in West Texas!
5146 2018-01-21 19:45:14 Reactivated my dating apps since arriving in #yyc. The city has 2 occupations as far as I can tell. Nurses and Oil and Gas specialists. What the hell is an oil and gas specialist?
5147 2018-01-21 19:45:10 Wtf my oil boy keep farting
5148 2018-01-21 19:44:56 coconut oil is a literally a 4 on the comedogenic scale... PLS DONT DO IT lol
5149 2018-01-21 19:44:38 trumpty dumpty will NEVER ALLOW IT! Doesn't want them to find out he was on the phone with his boss PUTIN getting his instructions on what his next move should be. HE HAS THOSE PEE PEE TAPES AND THE OIL COMPANY IN RUSSIA. HE BOUGHT 9% OF IT WITHOUT ANYBODY KNOWING IT!!
5150 2018-01-21 19:44:18 Ok, this is very interesting. I use the FAB pads for this very purpose. And then use an oil blend of my own making that helps with ingrown hairs. But still been using deodorant. Hmmm.... Maybe I could play around with this. Thanks!
5151 2018-01-21 19:44:15 I alternate between oils to moisturize my face since it can get really dry, and coconut oil has never done me wrong
5152 2018-01-21 19:44:08 His best asset is his blustery mouth which doesn't really line up with the lack of mental acuity. It's the snake oil salesman pitch which appeals to the 'sucker' who buys it. His businesses are bound to fail cause he really doesn't care once he has your money.
5153 2018-01-21 19:44:04 Hey COLO Energy Oil Gas Commodity Trading thanks for the follow!
5154 2018-01-21 19:44:02 It needs to be al dente cooled rice :) so @EarthlyDelites is right :) I'd add sesame oil as well as soy to mine
5155 2018-01-21 19:44:02 That makes sense. Methane leakage from oil and gas infrastructure (and flaring) subject to virtually no oversight or regulation, at least in the US. Obama admin crafted a rule to remediate part of the problem but you’ll be shocked to hear it has been suspended
5156 2018-01-21 19:43:57 Isn't it? All mine have cooking oil splatters.
5157 2018-01-21 19:43:53 He attempted to rile & antagonise the US when he could have kept up his rhetoric without attempting to keep prodding them with a stick.

He squandered huge oil resources leaving the country in ruin but redistributing $4.2bn to his daughter.

Perhaps that’s who Jezza was on about?
5158 2018-01-21 19:43:43 Yes, those idiots betrayed the Sirians when they needed them the most. 

They took the moment to go steal oil, sold their soul to the green devil (US dollars).
5159 2018-01-21 19:43:36 started steaming my face with coconut oil. 
5160 2018-01-21 19:43:34 Finally bought fuel from Forte Oil Lekki but we need to bring our generator tanks to fill it up because DPR says no jerrycans. I dont understand this Nigeria again o. Somehow sha the miscreants find fuel to hawk on the highway.
5161 2018-01-21 19:43:23 Same. I only do oil before bed, and only a small amount to reduce tangling at night.
5162 2018-01-21 19:43:18 Try black seed oil also.

5166 2018-01-21 19:42:38 what does the three oil smell like hun?
5167 2018-01-21 19:42:32 for dinner similar except I use salt, pepper, onion powder, ginger, tiny bit of nutmeg and saigon cinnamon, fry in coconut oil. Sometimes a splash of fish sauce.
5168 2018-01-21 19:42:29 I keep hearing about Norway’s $1.1 tn sovereign wealth fund,  a sorry reminder of the same North Sea Oil windfall that fell to Scotland. Squandered by a string of British governments, not the price of a tankful is put away for Scotland’s future.
5169 2018-01-21 19:42:27 With Pitch Pine the high oil content deter water and rot. The density of slow growth SP means the wood is less absorbant so it is harder for for water to penetrate. Lower grade faster grown softwoods, often used act like a sponge soaking up H2o and creating a nice rot friendly
5170 2018-01-21 19:42:27 Can i help you with that oil.
5171 2018-01-21 19:42:19 That will be a headwind for a few weeks but I meant it totally the opposite way. Draws are huge, market will be on average with worldwide stockpiles around mid-year (down hard from oversupply last years) with heavy tendency to go down more... Oil is set to go up from this.
5172 2018-01-21 19:42:03 @dayzeronocapetown was avoidable. If the Russians can build a pipeline 3600km to transport oil to the Aegian Sea, surely two workforces working from opposite ends, can lay a water pipeline from Natal Midlands to Cape Town. It can be done in 2 months. Why was this not considered?

5176 2018-01-21 19:40:41 We love diffusing at bedtime! A soothing essential oil blend like Tranquility is our go-to for a great nights rest.
5177 2018-01-21 19:40:30 A massage is greatly needed rn. My back is killing me & im dying to use this lotion & oil I got

5179 2018-01-21 19:40:20 Solution: "It's so important to apply a  treatment every two weeks to  rehydrate, strengthen, protect and maintain  hair health. A rich oil in-salon treatment such as Injibs Hot  Oil Treatment is ideal."
5180 2018-01-21 19:40:11 Bottom of the line is that we have to save the environment and preserve life on Earth. Burning fossil fuels does the opposite of that. Oil just makes everything worse in the long run unless some miracle scientific discovery happens. We have  to be less dependant on it. Sacrifice.

5190 2018-01-21 19:38:40 "I meant more because you two seem to get along like oil and water sometimes." She said with a smirk.
5191 2018-01-21 19:38:30 I'm not sure about the mileage on this one, might have to give you an oil change
5192 2018-01-21 19:38:23 True. But what are the NDP doing? Nothing. REDA needs change. AER useless. They just app tailings ponds lake districts.

5195 2018-01-21 19:38:05 I think I ate too much oil+vinegar with my bread last night. My insides feel acidic and bloated 
5196 2018-01-21 19:38:02 I can smell the coconut oil 
5197 2018-01-21 19:38:00 In Return of the King, when the Steward of Gondor pours oil over himself, why doesn’t it sting his eyes? I got the slighted splash of petrol in my eye once & I thought I was going to die.
5198 2018-01-21 19:37:40 Chavez made mistakes, an economic minnow took on the vested interests in global oil & the CIA. The oil price crashed, he didn’t diversify the economy & his enemies rounded on him for being so impertinent. They didn’t care about the poor of Venezuela. They made an example of them
5199 2018-01-21 19:37:34 Can't believe my dad actually just had to tell my brother not to put oil on his brakes
5200 2018-01-21 19:37:21 Don’ t ask him,he has no clue. Otherwise when asked by @MarrShow he would have elaborated rather than repeat himself. He didn’t even have the decency or mettle to accept his responsibility for any offence he caused to Esther McVey. Snake oil salesman!
5201 2018-01-21 19:37:08 Sure it's all self generated our money not the dirty oil money yous had  no one had even heard of city until they came
5202 2018-01-21 19:37:06 Wages and maybe Oil’s new wages too?
5203 2018-01-21 19:37:02 never forget when me and livies got stuck in toledo and we tried checking my oil with a tree stick
5204 2018-01-21 19:36:34 Yes. #SDF controls four times the oil reserves of all of Turkey. It's always about oil.  @DefenseIntel @CIA
5205 2018-01-21 19:36:23 I don’t blame Albertans for hating Ont, Que and BC. We stop their oil, take their jobs and then import it. So pretty normal to hate Toronto

5207 2018-01-21 19:35:57 My sister put me on some amazing facial oil. I've only been using it for a week, but so far so great.

5209 2018-01-21 19:35:37 they got the cocoa, shea, AND coconut oil out for the photoshoot
5210 2018-01-21 19:35:12 Same applies. A bar of gold or a barrel of oil or a fistful of dollars or a glass of water for the man dying of thirst?  Nothing has any intrinsic value. It's all place and time.
5211 2018-01-21 19:35:11 Dude u ppl hv short memory. Till end of 2013,petrol prices were almost completely in control of govt. It was de-regularized only in 2014. GOI has no cntrl over crude prices today,which is why Indian oil companies r doing so well and our deficit is under control.
5212 2018-01-21 19:34:44 Always buy the SECOND cheapest olive oil and you can’t go wrong
5213 2018-01-21 19:34:26 No it's all about power and to possess oil and gas 
5214 2018-01-21 19:34:20 I love my beard oil and balm. My fiance got me a brush. It's all so lovely
5215 2018-01-21 19:34:13 Hit your own charcoal oil
5216 2018-01-21 19:34:02 Yes it is but we have to be vigilant on who we let in. Some cultures are like oil and water. We have to know what values people have.
5217 2018-01-21 19:33:53 Left my phone under the hood of my truck after doing an oil change and drove 5 miles before realizing I didn't have it on me... I'm gonna take this luck and roll w it
5218 2018-01-21 19:33:33 Some of us are convinced that we should tell him to shove NAFTA. Plus we must end the US cheap oil. Canada is being taken for granted. We are Not That Friendly.
5219 2018-01-21 19:33:30 give me oil in my lamp keep me burning
5220 2018-01-21 19:33:14 Because oil is half of what it used to be. Kinda of hard to push your agenda when you would be making half the money you would previously.
5221 2018-01-21 19:33:12 just jugged a face masque, lavender body oil, and incense. my day is going amazing
5222 2018-01-21 19:32:53 Failed season by Oil I meant, not individuals

5224 2018-01-21 19:32:03 It's time to get an oil change.
5225 2018-01-21 19:32:01 You’ve never been a Park Ranger! If you had your way you’d give oil companies real Ranger jobs.

5228 2018-01-21 19:31:39 I know you didn't ask for suggestions, but because I sympathize, I suggest Dr. Teal's body lotion with essential oils. The combo of lotion and oil is soothing, I don't have to reapply before bed, and this stuff is cheap. Found it at Wal-Mart. Plus, it smells nice.

5233 2018-01-21 19:30:48 lady how disingenuous can you be? “perform an abortion!” “um i’m a foot / cancer / lung / brain / general practice doctor.” guess you also try to get your oil changed by an airplane mechanic.
5234 2018-01-21 19:30:47 Rasmus Dahlin might fit in pretty good with the Oil
5235 2018-01-21 19:30:43 Exactly. It’s funny to believe that any superpower country would save Iranian people from dictatorship, just for the sake of humanity. It’s about oil. It’s about economic profit.
5236 2018-01-21 19:30:36 Are you serious? Palestinian does not have Christians. Israel has Muslims and Christians that live and work there. You must get your education from CNN and MSNBC. What a joke.
5237 2018-01-21 19:30:24 The action's strategic goal is to drive a wedge between US and #SDF so ISIS can survive and Assad and Iran can seize the oil in the ERV. @DefenseUnits @DefenseIntel @CIA

5243 2018-01-21 19:29:41 I was going to make it today, too, but am worried this little headache might be a migraine. I really want to knock off the beginning of the buttercream, tho.

PS, I now have both kinds of coconut oil and can't decide which to use as recipe says virgin brings out vanilla/butter!
5244 2018-01-21 19:29:39 The oil change places, the car washes the fucking nail salons

5252 2018-01-21 19:28:09 Yeah, similar. But I think it's more deadly in Sudan. They've never known peace & prosperity, since attaining independence. And this is a rich country mind you. The LAND is very fertile, no one should go hungry in South Sudan. They also have vast reserves of oil. The West won't…
5253 2018-01-21 19:28:07 Hey womyn, I love how you persist.
5254 2018-01-21 19:28:03 Well we can look at the WH and know for a fact that politics and intellectualism are like water and oil.

5266 2018-01-21 19:26:37 Yup, a kid in school tried it with Olbas oil. Same guy later managed to cut off his thumb, but I don’t think it was masturbation related.

5275 2018-01-21 19:25:01 When I first got into art, I purchased a few courses from the amazing @virtualinstruct I spent most of today re-watching them and highly recommend Matts fantastic teaching methods in all mediums CP, #Pastel #Oil #Acrylics etc. I got Pastel & Colored Pencil amazing
5276 2018-01-21 19:24:59 'Tree Ranger' by Beardbrand is my go-to oil. Buy any decent quality boar bristle beard brush. Conditioner can be nice but can generate acne for some people.
5277 2018-01-21 19:24:59 Coconut oil in your body lotion soo you glow everyday 
5278 2018-01-21 19:24:53 Most stoves only need medium. Make a test . If you see that the  is getting “scorched” instead of golden, turn  down (iterative approach!). My other sign is the dark color of that oil/butter. Never let the oil smoke, it will burn and make the  look/taste bad.
5279 2018-01-21 19:24:50 The 'visible beads of oil welling up out of the pores on their nose when it's hot out and they haven't washed their face' lobby agrees with that.
5280 2018-01-21 19:24:46 Kitchen fire. Frying pan oil ignited. The tenant alerted their neighbor and heard the commotion in the stairwell (only 4 apartments). Fire brigade was there within minutes and we sheltered at a neighboring house for an hour. Back home and ventilating now. No damages on our side
5281 2018-01-21 19:24:39 You ain't cleaning unless you done moved everything out its original spot. You also ain't cleaning unless your smell like comet,pine oil(can't afford pine soil), and fabuloso. That's the sign of a clean house.

5288 2018-01-21 19:23:58 Avocado, Orange juice (without added sugar, from a carton -fresh doesn't work for me-) coconut oil, moringa powder and some nuts or seeds...
5289 2018-01-21 19:23:57 Anyone have any extra oil Kings tickets?
5290 2018-01-21 19:23:51 Oil? Tech? We need names to be convinced.
5291 2018-01-21 19:23:47 Now oil companies can drill on once protected lands. You prick!
5292 2018-01-21 19:23:39 I gotta stop using clove oil and then touching my face my lip is numb :(
5293 2018-01-21 19:23:38  u feel more of a man after you work on your car and change your oil
5294 2018-01-21 19:23:33 Incredible, those steam eruptions are huge! That's a hundred gallons of boiling water, easily a couple hundred of fuel oil.
5295 2018-01-21 19:23:32 sudah! seriously best, for my oily skin, memang elok. pores bersih, control oil, reduce sebum!
5296 2018-01-21 19:23:14 なんやねんこの時間は
5297 2018-01-21 19:23:02 And its not bubble bath but oil bubbling
5298 2018-01-21 19:22:49 Coconut oil makes your skin look amazing
5299 2018-01-21 19:22:48 You can always go in for free smells, and order a salad instead. Oh, nevermind. This is Hardee's we're referencing.

5304 2018-01-21 19:22:10 Chavez’s social policies were intended to right the wrongs committed against a population robbed of their oil wealth by decades of corrupt foreign government intervention. But like I say this knowledge will conflict with your simple certainties.
5305 2018-01-21 19:22:10 Depends if u mix it with other ingredients. Search on youtube “coconut oil curly hair” the girls r mostly right to whatever they say. Also to keep the frizz to a minimum u could use the spread shits for cooking? Idk how they call it, i might be wrong but its something like that
5306 2018-01-21 19:22:06 Sounds like something that only someone who doesn't have literal oil stained pillowcases if they skip washing their hair for one day would say.
5307 2018-01-21 19:21:40 Yes we value our men and women in uniform by sending them to fight and die for capitalist elites and their greedy appetite for oil and corporate exploitation of the oppressed.
5308 2018-01-21 19:21:38 Bumble and Bumble sea salt spray- good for extra fluff with hairdryer 
Grave Before Shave- balm and oil
Marke Golddachs- wax and oil 
Kent- comb and brush 
Aveda- most of their conditioners are 
5309 2018-01-21 19:21:35 Cyan play mas if u fraid oil 
5310 2018-01-21 19:21:29 hehe yesh, if you dont have make up remover, just use baby oil but fcking annoying cause end up our face jadi oily and need to wash again.
5311 2018-01-21 19:21:09 worked there. Sunflower oil, butter salt (Bulk Barn has it) and use a Whirrly Pop kettle (or just continuously stir it it yourself) and bingo banging, you have their popcorn. The flavoured stuff was the same you get at grocery stores; just shaken with the popcorn in a garbage bag
5312 2018-01-21 19:21:06 Dis nigga really fried chicken wit Hennessy instead of oil#HennythingIsPossible
5313 2018-01-21 19:20:53 Ditto for the electronics, garments, pottery and tiles. The list goes on and on. Finally oil. Mexico has NO refineries. They must sell raw petroleum only to buy it back. In so many ways I believe NAFTA has increased the brain drain in Mexico, as educated head to US.
5314 2018-01-21 19:20:50 coconut oil + a layer of base coat, weekly does wonders for your nails
5315 2018-01-21 19:20:44 I’m so mad I got oil on my black leggings 
5316 2018-01-21 19:20:41 @SarahBaska ur ass needs to use that salt water spray FOR YOUR EAR I DONT KNOW IF TEA TREE OIL WILL CLESN IT PROPERLY CAUSE IT PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE SANITIZED
5317 2018-01-21 19:20:34 Kiir is okay, the problem is Machar. He fell into a trap by outsiders (the West), who promised him they'll make him président, in turn want the oil in S Sudan & control of its beautiful, lush arable land. The problem here is Reyk. He is being used by the west.
5318 2018-01-21 19:20:26 @bobmillstt midget farms,secreted guns, essential oil,tall mothers and Derek achora lampooning himself. Throw in some Mediterranean Auburn haired henchmen and big Ricky hamming it up like a cockeny,love my mom gangster and you have a underated gem
5319 2018-01-21 19:20:08 It was not always such a horrible party. 
The GOP had Nixon and the Bushes...and despite all the plaudits heaped on him, Reagan was NO saint.
Without the world oil glut he had, his era would not have been remembered so fondly, mark my words. 
I was a Dem until Clinton.
5320 2018-01-21 19:20:07 That's not surprising. When I worked in the oilfield, I learned it took copious amounts of coffee to get oil out of the ground.
5321 2018-01-21 19:19:59 My big win? Finding the oil cartridge for my weed pen I thought I lost. AND on the Lord’s day?! Hallelooyerrrr 
5322 2018-01-21 19:19:51 Big Oil runs this country.
5323 2018-01-21 19:19:26 There goes clean air, water, lands, FDA over site, etc.
You will slowly poison us all by allowing pollutors to run wild whether it be
the coal, fracking, oil industry with little or no oversight.
5324 2018-01-21 19:19:26 now i know why my skins so fuckin dry since i started using coconut oil to remove my make up
5325 2018-01-21 19:19:19 I filled a jar with water and a little bit of oil then dumped a bunch of glitter in. Shaking the jar and watching it settle helps with my anxiety
5326 2018-01-21 19:19:19 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
5327 2018-01-21 19:18:55 Based on past such @TheEconomist essays, probably time to sell #oil.
5328 2018-01-21 19:18:51 oil
5329 2018-01-21 19:18:46 Good lord changing the oil on a Toyota is a MASSIVE pain in the ass.
5330 2018-01-21 19:18:37 coconut oil? does it keep the frizz to a minimum or something?
5331 2018-01-21 19:18:00 I always feel so excited when I am at this stage with my oil painting.... before the mistakes set in !
5332 2018-01-21 19:17:49 Presumably you are also campaigning to stop the drilling for oil in the Falklands?
5333 2018-01-21 19:17:33 Yo that kid suffering from seizures who's a Gronk fan needs to use Rick Simpson Oil. It will stop the seizures and heal him.
5334 2018-01-21 19:17:30 How do y'all use your rosehip oil? 
5335 2018-01-21 19:17:25 People forget that the last time there was a government shutdown, service-members suffered, AND lowly gov't workers suffered. My son's platoon ran out of gdamn oil for their vehicles, he had to call me to put money into his account for everyday bills. It's both party's fault.
5336 2018-01-21 19:17:22 Oil change & Car Wash 
5337 2018-01-21 19:17:21 i need some black soap & some sweet almond oil. i need to get out of this bed.
5338 2018-01-21 19:17:20 Try it to the side, dont do middle part, that usually looks horrible. Also when u have curly hair you best friend is coconut oil
5339 2018-01-21 19:17:10 #TurkeyCleansTerrorFromAfrin IS NOT AN OIL. IS NOT AN INVASION. JUST FOR A PEACE.
5340 2018-01-21 19:17:07 Nak jimat macam aku, tiap tiap malam, contoh harini taruk extra virgin olive oil kat muka, esok virgin coconut oil, lusa taruk madu, the next 2 days rest. Repeat. Cehh
5341 2018-01-21 19:16:54 He sat in the HOC as Harper stripped Transport Canada of enforcement powers, rolled back safety measures so his pals in the oil biz could ship at a lower cost. #CPC through those actions cost lives, now he says Trudeau fix things w/ no acknowledgement of where the prob came from
5342 2018-01-21 19:16:27 Found my favorite on an episode of @MeatEaterTV. Cut 1-2" thick, pound flat, flour/egg wash/breadcrumbs, fry in oil couple min per side
5343 2018-01-21 19:16:10 99% positive i need an oil change
5344 2018-01-21 19:16:03 Create steam in bathroom and stay in there with child 4 10mins... add oilbas oil if child is over 6mnths
5345 2018-01-21 19:15:54 Of course you stand with Egypt. It’s not about terrorism, it’s about oil.
5346 2018-01-21 19:15:54 stop trying to moisturize your dry skin with coconut oil, you just sealing in the dryness
5347 2018-01-21 19:15:50 Is the brand 29 Cosmetics still around? I haven’t seen it since I got a box of goodies from @LivePoshly years ago. I need to re-up on their grape seed oil lipgloss if so!

5349 2018-01-21 19:15:45 Cleaned my Jeep, got an oil change, went to Walmart &’ now getting food. It’s been a productive Sunday.
5350 2018-01-21 19:15:21 So analyze the oil find out where it was manufactured hold the producer responsible for selling it to an irresponsible consume.and make them do the footwork to recover the loss.
5351 2018-01-21 19:15:16 Who else uses coconut oil to fry egg? 
5352 2018-01-21 19:15:13 Oh just sod off.   Nobody is buying your snake oil, Pence.
5353 2018-01-21 19:15:09 RT @LivingSafely: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this January? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.
5354 2018-01-21 19:15:07 They do for the oil companies

5357 2018-01-21 19:14:54 omg the us sephora always has the best sales canada stays missing out on these deals  the ceramidin body oil seems fantastic
5358 2018-01-21 19:14:50  dipped herself and oil and you won’t believe the results!  scientists HATE her!
5359 2018-01-21 19:14:41 put castor oil on my lashes last night and am very disappointed that they did not grow over night tbh
5360 2018-01-21 19:14:29 Why does our government equate energy independence with more oil drilling instead of doing more to get electric cars produced and on the road? (U.S cars not Chinese) U.S. transportation accounts for 70% of U.S. oil consumption
5361 2018-01-21 19:14:19 @RepEvanJenkins you looked like a snake oil salesman
5362 2018-01-21 19:14:15 In 2 years time no single drop water in Malaysia because of oil palm tree.
5363 2018-01-21 19:14:09 Last night I remember I was too high to function correctly but all I could try and do was do my nightly routine of washing my face until I realized I wasn’t at home and all I had was coconut oil in my bag
5364 2018-01-21 19:13:58 Turkish can not be STOPPED. Wild america just killing people for oil. the YGPs there are just a  silly pawn, probably all Armenian origin. The Turks only promise a beautiful life all world. The Turks are in the army of the Prophet Muhammad (SAV). #TurksCanNotBeStopped
5365 2018-01-21 19:13:32 Lol, the Fraser Institute... Politicized crap, always find green energy bad. Fact is, it's now cheaper to generate from wind and solar, except for subsidies for oil, i.e. your tax dollars.
5366 2018-01-21 19:13:30 Adivina quien fumigo fuel oil jajaa
5367 2018-01-21 19:13:29 Ate them sautéed with grilled halloumi, toasted walnut and honey-olive oil dressing. Yummy
5368 2018-01-21 19:13:25 We haven’t been on the gold standard for a while. The only thing that has kept any value in the USD was anyone wanting to buy oil had to convert to USD to do so. With cryptocurrency you will now see that dropping.

5374 2018-01-21 19:12:45 Oil>>>>Lotion
5375 2018-01-21 19:12:41 I found that if you put a little bit of oil on your fingers it makes it easier to slide on the screen
5376 2018-01-21 19:12:34 What you need is beard oil! 
5377 2018-01-21 19:12:29 My oil is changed. Naomi is ready to go
5378 2018-01-21 19:12:19 If coconut oil works for your face, cool. But i cannaaaaah. My hair dont like it either.
5379 2018-01-21 19:11:36 Niggaz that sip oil know the risks associated with it but they also don't have crackhead tendencies

5397 2018-01-21 19:10:06 Oh prob just need a tune up and an oil change. Prob just an oil change
5398 2018-01-21 19:10:00 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
5399 2018-01-21 19:09:55 it’s all about those snacks using rapeseed oil. I don’t understand why brands aren’t being more responsible!! @DoritosUK
5400 2018-01-21 19:09:51 Nah, I totally believe it.  I've lived through multiple versions of the phenomenon.  I used to do all my own auto work (and I'm not just talking oil changes), and you'd be amazed how some guys react when you try to give them auto advice.
5401 2018-01-21 19:09:50 Pretty much steak houses. Lots of olive oil, meat, compliant veggies. Taquerias - carnitas on lettuce with salsa, onions, avocado. Most of the   places do oil and vinegar. A couple paleo friendly places.
5402 2018-01-21 19:09:49 Oh my goodness, that was a perfect loin of deer, simply with roasted wedge potatoes, and long stem broccoli in wok with a touch of garlic, chili, soy sauce, olive oil and white wine vinegar. No sauce required. This was simple, but perfect for right now.

Oh, and wine.
5403 2018-01-21 19:09:47 And oil?
5404 2018-01-21 19:09:32 Get some Aloe Vera Gel & mix it with Tea Tree Oil.. mine was horrendous last week and I’ve done that every night & its cleared it up!!!

5410 2018-01-21 19:08:57 I've never felt more like a successful adult than buying the right oil for my car without asking for help or crying. 
5411 2018-01-21 19:08:56 That’s not oil :). Apparently it’s a mix of mud, vegetation etc. That they are depositing to fight erosion
5412 2018-01-21 19:08:55 Skincare, I really wanna get this oil problem under control 
5413 2018-01-21 19:08:41 "There are two kinds of people in the world those with loaded guns and those that dig" those that have oil in their lamps and those that don't.
5414 2018-01-21 19:08:37 It's just something about roasted vegetables drizzled in olive oil with some salt and pepper

5417 2018-01-21 19:08:30 Mamka: jezisi, nedavej si ten tea tree oil, smrdíš že by člověk padl. Dej si radši tu zelenou (konopnou) vodičku.. to mate vy mladí rádi, ne
5418 2018-01-21 19:08:15 Oil and gas still very much relevant though. That tweet is not informed 
5419 2018-01-21 19:07:50 My hair is SUPER dry , hopefully this coconut oil does the trick
5420 2018-01-21 19:07:44 I need to go to the beauty supply store to get some more eco styler gel. The Jamaican Black Castor Oil kind
5421 2018-01-21 19:07:43 Baaaabe top it up with the tanning milk and oil n it will change your life it stops it getting to the patchy stage
5422 2018-01-21 19:07:24 I use rose hip oil nightly, just put it on a cotton pad and put it all over your face. Helps with acne scarring/discoloration. Plus it’s super moisturizing

5426 2018-01-21 19:06:56 Demand for oil, both CBD and THC, are huge and I think will stay that way. Vape pens and oil are the future. Companies like $weed will make the profit of selling the product.
5427 2018-01-21 19:06:54 Put a fried egg with butter & sesame oil & soy sauce in my rice. I believe I have discovered the secret to making breakfast that actually is filling but not heavy
5428 2018-01-21 19:06:52 extremely bold statements.
1. Can you outline the key differences between evidence based and evidence informed. 2. Can you provide prooof for your second statement that “our” research is snake oil, rife with bias and flawed methodology
3. Your profile promotes pseudoscience.

5433 2018-01-21 19:06:02 I'd ask if there is a diabetes cure industry, but it doesn't exist... Except to you, who hawked a "cure" like a carpetbagging snake oil salesman from yesteryear.

5448 2018-01-21 19:03:51 I cook a lot of veg in the air fryer. Though my fav is honey, olive oil and garlic. I also love salt, pepper and paprika. Or coconut oil is delish too.

5478 2018-01-21 19:01:10 The Kurds being used as pawns. The US believes their false promises of the Kurds being able to hold on to oil revenues, and always the tantalising prospect of independence, will keep them toeing the line. It's lies. They will be used. Kurds will be betrayed as always.

5483 2018-01-21 19:00:19 The success is doubtful, but the after consequences would be very very large. 

What's more likely is a coup. 

But any change in saudi politics, inevitably (due to oil) has a huge effect on the rest of the world. Especially the muslim world. Mecca is in Saudi after all....
5484 2018-01-21 19:00:14 It's like wax and oil.

5486 2018-01-21 18:59:53 If oil money could be spent in green economy tax free. Rather than entrenching resistance with taxes government will spend on bureaucrats. We might see a revolution. We need tax incentives not disincentives to trigger change. A free market solution.

5493 2018-01-21 18:59:02 I'm going to just leave the M.D. reference lying there. I am too often accused of MD-bashing.

5496 2018-01-21 18:58:00 But if people see the lies they were told and see the benefit of being our own country again surely they have the right to choose We are losing BILLIONs and with the oil price rising that figure is rising daily  Even with the losses attributed to brexit we could still do well
5497 2018-01-21 18:57:58 Whizz leftover veg (or peeled broccoli stalk) in food processor with an egg and enough flour to bind it. Then fry blobs of mix in oil&butter to make fritters. Great with eggs for breakfast.

5514 2018-01-21 18:54:37 Is it a coincidence that this happened very shortly after NASA scientists led a report showing that the oil and gas industry are responsible for 17% of the 25% rise in atmospheric methane??

5516 2018-01-21 18:54:27 That is often the end result, but usually not the reason we support the dictators and terror groups in the first place. Goes back to the enemy of the enemy thing.  Also goes to oil in the Middle East often.

5524 2018-01-21 18:53:30 It is totally unclear that the protocol is brilliant. It is totally unclear that it works they way they claim it should. It is totally unclear that it is not snake oil.

5532 2018-01-21 18:51:48 We need to look at the true costs of energy pollution cancer health, which also apply to everything we manufacture etc. Big question is how we incentivise green growth with the wealth of the world in oil business determined to fight against it. Positive tax advantages/incentives?
5533 2018-01-21 18:51:47 So someone said, only if Nigeria supplies at least 20hrs of light everyday, improves it's transportation system (BRT, Trains and ferries) the use of personal cars, generators will reduce and so will the oil industry be at peace...

True?

5547 2018-01-21 18:49:48 It's in At My Table, so she seems to have taken it off her site for now. Hopefully it'll come back. But it's just 100g coriander, 100ml oil (I used much less), 3 cloves garlic, 3 jalapenos, zest plus juice of 2 limes, plenty of salt. Blend, put it on everything.

5568 2018-01-21 18:47:45 Eucalyptus and peppermint are fantastic for opening up the sinuses when you are sick or just for getting that invigorating feeling. Try squeezing a few drops of that or what oils you prefer in your shower stream. The hot water hits the oil and you get a fabulous scented shower.

5570 2018-01-21 18:47:34 If you dry the oil and grease off your slice of pizza with a napkin you do not deserve that pizza in the first place
5571 2018-01-21 18:47:26 Old news: lack of investments in oil industry since 2015 (and obvious fall in production) is mostly due to banks not allowed to give loans to Venezuela in USD based on US sanctions and sabotage. #Petro is actually about that too, not only to solve oil trade

5579 2018-01-21 18:46:38 As I didn't see it, what were the different voices? I'm intrigued re how you might deal with a proposition that melted Arctic could benefit anyone (except oil barons) in reality.
5580 2018-01-21 18:46:30 Start asking McConnell if he knows who is behind the ships caught transferring oil to North Korean ships.  Then ask him which businesses benefit from providing supplies to build the border wall.
5581 2018-01-21 18:46:28 Well, I guess at least one oil producing country can see the future. Unfortunately, the US’ current rulers are incapable of doing so.
5582 2018-01-21 18:46:23 ...and in fact we may be in store for an even bigger pull back. If we had a 2008 style crisis, inventories would highly unlikely be cut back enough to sustain a big rally. Whats your view in the event of such a stock mrkt crash to oil?
5583 2018-01-21 18:46:01 Hi! There are some great books and websites with pre-measured (tried) oil recipes that have amazing smells. I like the outdoors and the scent of trees, so eucalyptus, pine, bay laurel, rosemary, and cypress are some favorites of mine.
5584 2018-01-21 18:45:56 At what rate do you think the Eurobond proceeds were converted? Or better still, at what rate do you think oil export proceeds are converted?
5585 2018-01-21 18:45:45 So I’m growing out my hair and I’m taking biotin with keratin and using keratin oil shampoo and conditioner and my hair is so incredibly SOFT, it’s RIDICULOUS.
5586 2018-01-21 18:45:37 Yo i bee. Tryna figure out who sing "sara smile" ALL NIGHT not the hall and oats version but like body suits and baby oil on stage singing ya frel me.. I need the radio version!
5587 2018-01-21 18:45:24 Some Sunday wisdom:

1. Oil cannot be used as a vegan alternative to eggs in baking.

2. The resulting molten chocolate mixture glistens because its 90% oil.

3. DO NOT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ATTEMPT TO EAT IT!
5588 2018-01-21 18:45:21 who has oil refills for the oil pen?!?????
5589 2018-01-21 18:45:20 Get peppermint oil and diffuser. It's magic.
5590 2018-01-21 18:45:08 Ingredient Watch: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this January? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.
5591 2018-01-21 18:45:03 Hmm.. overpaid, disrespectful, no longer watched, football players telling you what kind of oil to use?
5592 2018-01-21 18:45:02 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
5593 2018-01-21 18:44:46 I want to draw women just so I can draw them not glowing and covered in oil like a lot of people do
5594 2018-01-21 18:44:26 ok, oil change time.
5595 2018-01-21 18:44:25 This is the story of my adorable yet clumsy kitten, Kevin. He accompanied me down cellar while I was doing the laundry this morning. Neville was on this old oil drum (I don’t know why it’s still down there) but poor Kevin is too large to get up there.
5596 2018-01-21 18:44:20 I was not on a 3 day week .i worked as most did.Inflation was a result of increased oil price from OPEC .The strikes was justified because of the attack  on working people .The 70 was good times
5597 2018-01-21 18:44:12 If it's not physiologically plausible, then yeah, it's snake oil. And depending on how good a used car salesman I am will influence the patient expectations and outcomes. But let's not pretend wearing a lucky charm actually influences the forces of nature to  probability
5598 2018-01-21 18:44:08 This guy is snake oil salesman.
5599 2018-01-21 18:44:06 I got 2 more bottles of black seed oil available until my next shipment comes in get em now

5602 2018-01-21 18:43:19 Have you gotten your three servings of coconut oil today? Bonus points if it's sustainable.
5603 2018-01-21 18:43:13 Burn oil moment for bhakt :P
5604 2018-01-21 18:42:54 I blame the Democrats for the shutdown.

If they would just capitulate and allow all social programs to be defunded and cut, the national parks handed over to the oil lobbies, and just accepted the fact that kids don't need any damn healthcare, we'd have it all passed right now.
5605 2018-01-21 18:42:23 A estos precios del crudo resulta rentable la extracción del Shale oil, por lo que el petróleo no tiene mucho recorrido al alza.
5606 2018-01-21 18:42:19 Lol bcuz them nor get oil for head. Even if Ghanaian do ritual, they still won't blow. Ghana is the headquarters for Yahoo rituals incase you don't know 
5607 2018-01-21 18:41:57 BREAKING NEWS!!
 
The enemies have done their worst . . . 

Just when we are complaining about fuel/oil scarcity. Some wicked people have secretly reduced the oil inside Titus sardine. 
     . . . I suspect NNPC!!!
                   
5608 2018-01-21 18:41:55 Fair enough.
5609 2018-01-21 18:41:43 @BeardBooze just bought a 7 sample pack of your beard oil. Can't wait to find a favorite!
5610 2018-01-21 18:41:41 In addition, people continue to also use bio-fuels, like ethanol and bio-diesel, to also help free us from foreign oil.
5611 2018-01-21 18:41:34 Whew! I was worried! Not.
5612 2018-01-21 18:41:22 gasoline comes from nature with 125,000 btus/gal. Oil has even more because it contains diesel that contains 140,000 btus/gal and it takes an insignificant amount of energy to separate them.

5615 2018-01-21 18:40:53 It is sheer IGNORANT HUBRIS AND NARCICSIM to make the bogus claims of being a MASTER OF ORGANIZATION AND PROBLEM SOLVING when indeed you ARE the PROBLEM, the CHAOS, the SNAKE OIL HAWKER!!

5621 2018-01-21 18:40:01 I’ve always assumed Richard II squirted his bare chest with oil on the word, “murthered.” As one does.
5622 2018-01-21 18:39:58 That's exactly what I was just about to suggest! Except they're usually diced, coated in pre heated, roasting hot olive oil, (mixed with spices) and then done in the oven, and you don't need to par-boil them, so even less effort, which is a big plus in my opinion!
5623 2018-01-21 18:39:56 They have killed enough innocent people all over the world. So the world is happy that it can get a break for some days from the oppressors. They don't murder for freedom they do it for G.O.D. Gold Oil Drugs

5627 2018-01-21 18:39:35 Curacao has more to do but dirtier and a lot of industry/oil refineries. Bonaire has none of that. More nature
5628 2018-01-21 18:39:29 Guy at gas station strikes up a conversation while I'm checking oil..
"It's nice to see a woman taking care of her car."
"Yep. Check oil and make sandwiches. It's what I do."
5629 2018-01-21 18:39:28 58,000 in vietnam american soldiers and close to 500,000 vietnamese and cambodians if you dodge the draft your were sent to prison many americans escaped to Canada and abroad to avoid the war
how many countries do we exploit for their oil and minerals etcetc

5635 2018-01-21 18:38:26 There was a previous tweet|retweet that talked about coconut oil as an ingredient. It's extremely comedogenic for myself and others.
5636 2018-01-21 18:38:14 But my name isn’t James?! I don’t have his oil man!
5637 2018-01-21 18:38:13 So far the two sides have refrained from attempting to destroy each others [NEW] 'oil' fields, and have concentrated in destroying refineries, industries and oil installations.  (a) TAKE NOTE MIGHTY USA ; USA cc @Ali_H_Soufan + Team #WomensMarch2018

5649 2018-01-21 18:37:00 Kat, the other day I called a mechanic in Kearney to have Emily get her oil changed and tires rotated. When I gave Emily's last name, they go "is it Kathy Olsufka?" Kinda crazy they still had your name in their system.
5650 2018-01-21 18:36:58 When Obama was president didn't you say "Presidents are responsible for Government Shutdowns"? It boggles my mind how Evangelicals support you when  Oil and Water is coming out of the same spout? To whom much is given much is required.. LEAD!!!

5655 2018-01-21 18:36:27 Not in the oil business
5656 2018-01-21 18:36:26 Well have done chicken, turkey, duck, and pork in the oil less Char-Broil Big Easy now trying a goose. Not sure how that will go
5657 2018-01-21 18:36:24 The thought of growing fuel didn't seem that goofy in the 1970s, when the US was embargoed and the price of oil was skyrocketing.

Back then, we were even looking into running IC engines on pulverized coal. I remember, I was there.
5658 2018-01-21 18:36:11 Tendré que ir hasta la oil a comprarme provisiones, va a ser una larga tarde/noche de netflix

5667 2018-01-21 18:34:59 I said it couple of days ago, the production of oil decreased in Venezuela 33% , they have no money to build new infrastructure or drilling, nobody trust the corrupt gov of @NicolasMaduro, he is a murderer, he killed Oscar Perez a real Venezuelan patriot #NoMasMaduro #StopPetro
5668 2018-01-21 18:34:58 So grateful to have a dad and boyfriend who are mechanics and taught me how to do basic maintance on my vehicles like changing the oil, tires, etc. 
5669 2018-01-21 18:34:33 Dictators and autocrats children r everywhere.. family office .. Bilal looking where he can get oil and where he can deliver weapons to jihadi scum.

5676 2018-01-21 18:33:39 Latest obsession: rosemary olive oil "artisanal" bread. Goes great with eggs if you toast it slightly.
5677 2018-01-21 18:33:38 1..I agree mate that it’s all about oil. I wish we had gone into Zimbabwe to snuff out totalitarianism but as you say the petro dollar don’t Apply to African wars .. But I stil Stand by the fact that our way of life is more liberal than the regimes that most liberals support over
5678 2018-01-21 18:33:07 14. Before there were street lights in European cities, ancient Benin kingdom had street lights fueled by palm oil.
5679 2018-01-21 18:33:06 palm oil is one of the worst, if not the main thing thats destroying the rainforest', do you eradicate that from every single aspect of your life? get out of my face
5680 2018-01-21 18:32:55 My pain tolerance for little hot droplets of oil hitting my hand as I cook has gotten significantly lower after I left food service
5681 2018-01-21 18:32:42 When a friend is too angry for another friend and sometimes they wonder why I don't tell them things... well. I don't want to add oil to raging fires I'm too tired for that now
5682 2018-01-21 18:32:40 Wow! Just a few feet from the #InglewoodOilField - the largest contiguous urban oil field in the US.
5683 2018-01-21 18:32:32 I believe it was reasonably good (although it should be with all that oli).

The point is that isn’t it now & that’s because the ‘socialist’ policies they chose to enact bankrupted a country with one of the world’s highest oil reserves.

Which is why they’re stoning cows for food
5684 2018-01-21 18:32:05 warm honey, olive oil, and your fav blend of fruits on stovetop to your desired consistency 
5685 2018-01-21 18:32:01 Big oil/gas companies donate millions of dollars to their re-election campaigns. It’s less so that they don’t believe climate change & more so that they’re told to not believe in it.
5686 2018-01-21 18:31:51 None because oil is a commodity and this government makes billions out of it remember the oil strikes not log back the country was fucked within 3 days and the government turned it into the picketers saying police and ambulance couldn't get no fuel .more fake news!
5687 2018-01-21 18:31:46 Are you buying Koch products. Koch oil and gas? If you are you are supporting the very people who financed this entire disaster.
5688 2018-01-21 18:31:26 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

5694 2018-01-21 18:30:21 When some of you hear ph,  you think the oil runs in everyone's backyard.  It'll shock you to note that some communities don't have nothing..  Pipeline sef no run pass their land..

5699 2018-01-21 18:29:20 Oh dear....did you have to go and read Wings over Scotland website to come up with that crap? UK economy hasn't relied on oil for a very long time and Whisky revenues are attributed to Scotland.
5700 2018-01-21 18:29:17 Very happy to hear this, welcome to the struggle! Top tip; @DoritosUK are killing the rainforest but Asda own brand tortilla chips don’t contain palm oil!
5701 2018-01-21 18:29:15 Had a bath and then tried some @LOCCITANE_UK body oil  my legs are so soft

5709 2018-01-21 18:28:26 "What's up, my guy? I'm at Walmart getting my oil changed, come through." 

The guy next to me to his friend over the phone as I also wait to get my oil changed.
5710 2018-01-21 18:28:23 EROI is a useful indicator, but not everything. What type of energy is produced matters as well. Thermochemical conversation to Fischer-Tropsch fuels or pyrolysis oil displaces of diesel, which is, for next few decades, probably more valuable than displacing fossil gas
5711 2018-01-21 18:28:22 Sorry I'm jumping in recklessly but, if you've got anything related to the Sciences, Oil and gas, anything technical.... I am very interested. I'm in Delta state but relocating to anywhere isn't a problem. Insofar it's not the North!
5712 2018-01-21 18:28:16 If you keep calling the same thing forever (ie oil will trade down someday), of course you will be right at some point in time. However when JS called for prices to go to $40 and they went to $65, that is just a plainly brutal call.

5714 2018-01-21 18:28:01 Not even because it's campaign year. The US is about to ruin the wold economy with its oil. Oil prices are about to crash and countries without diversified economies will crash.
5715 2018-01-21 18:27:59 Yeah....Todd and Ben like oil and water. They don't mix.
5716 2018-01-21 18:27:58 I've had no issue with buy in when I've put away all the snake oil. Perhaps we are the ones that lack the confidence in our abilities without fancy gimmicks.
5717 2018-01-21 18:27:57 Because the "great negotiator" persona was just BS. He's a snake oil salesman.

5720 2018-01-21 18:27:52 Oil rigs are so shit, haven’t seen my dad in like 2/3 months because they’re only giving him 2 days off a month just about :/
5721 2018-01-21 18:27:48 All of that, and I also consider whether a government believes and spreads the message that the quality of education and health care in Alberta should depend on the price of oil or blames public servants for its own inability to manage $ while giving handouts to cronies.

5744 2018-01-21 18:24:55 Lol. I have some. Technically.

I was shocked how perfectly a tsp of olive oil in the morning was for my feet. Nothing had worked. That little bit of oil means no peeling, no cracking and relatively soft skin (my feet had always been almost fingernail hard).
5745 2018-01-21 18:24:52 mamador cooking oil.. good for the heart as well
5746 2018-01-21 18:24:51 woof pal D told M - just need baby oil !
5747 2018-01-21 18:24:24 I like it. It's not too thick so I use it in the mornings before my makeup and at night but I have to add an oil.

5752 2018-01-21 18:23:42 USD/CAD has not been following the oil price correlation since the BoC Gov. Said they can live with an oil price below $40 NAFTA is the key thing here and the dovish nature of the last rate hike.
5753 2018-01-21 18:23:40 It’s one thing to have real companies advertise on @instagram, its another to have snake oil salesmen. Allowing shady diet pills to be pushed is gross. Why is this being allowed? Is there not anyone monitoring the content?

5756 2018-01-21 18:23:24 it's a cheap copy ( albeit a decent lawsuit Japanese one from the 70's) I'm stripping back to bare wood ( alder) for a danish oil finish. Doing the usual luthier fretwork on the neck. Changing the pickups ( single humbucker on the neck) other hardware etc.
5757 2018-01-21 18:23:14 Finally getting an oil change like a good citizen.

5764 2018-01-21 18:22:22 @Hulu and @verizon are really making me hate Thomas Middleditch.  I thought oil and basalmic was where the madness ended.  Twenty repetitions of the draped logo commercial has shown that the madness can go deeper.
5765 2018-01-21 18:22:19 We don't need to turn back the clock with #MAGA back then was a recession we don't need that again, back then inflation hit highs, oil shortages, not enough jobs, souplinesgrew.. slavery and fighting with British We need #Americatoprogress #moveforward #dobetter
5766 2018-01-21 18:22:08 Why do you think we only oppose oppressive regimes in the Middle East, not central Africa or Asia?

It’s about oil and control, not about protecting freedom around the world. To be more specific, it’s about controlling oil markets so USD is backed by oil (rather than gold).

5773 2018-01-21 18:21:30 I use the almond oil for the body & sometimes hair (I have some ). I throw *everything* at my feet.

Working Hands/Working Feet are good, but I have to use a lot.

5775 2018-01-21 18:20:56 Because you are driving through red states. All the corpses are in the blue states.
5776 2018-01-21 18:20:47 Ten years ago "peak oil" did *not* merely mean maximum production, an immediate decline following the peak was an inherent part.

Trying to now redefine "peak oil" as merely maximum production and claiming it was always so is disingenuous at best.
5777 2018-01-21 18:20:35 I dont think my coconut oil liked being frozen in the airplane "trunk" cause not it refuses to be a cream again so guess I'll be using liquid coconut oil on my body
5778 2018-01-21 18:20:32 Then maybe one should write a poem of slaughter for all those in lands of oil governments in the west inflict with joy for you to take notice. But I understand, you would have to admit how you've allowed it to continue.

5780 2018-01-21 18:20:03 I've heard good things about almond oil, but I'm not sure where it would fit for me. I tried to use coconut oil at one point, but my skin refused to absorb it. It just made me shiny.
5781 2018-01-21 18:20:02 West coast we would use coconut oil.
5782 2018-01-21 18:19:42 Coconut oil is trash.
5783 2018-01-21 18:19:40 God sealed the poisonous gas and oil beneath the ground to protect us, white man breaks that seal and the earth rumbles and shakes, the descendants of the ones who were here when the land was young seek to protect what God created for us all, we are one.
5784 2018-01-21 18:19:37 Bet, bet, bet @MonatWithSanny her oil can help, message her shit clears wonders it may make them fade  one thing I never asked but look into it baby
5785 2018-01-21 18:19:36 I never felt unsafe in Beijing because every inch of the city is covered with cameras and there's lots of undercover policeman to protect people like me.

5788 2018-01-21 18:19:03 Lotion (a specific kind) for my arms to keep away eczema. Olive oil to keep my feet from cracking.

5800 2018-01-21 18:17:33 I like how you describe yourself as a "conservative vegan." It reminds me of my feeling of being "beyond vegan." A good example is when I see a product with palm oil, not listed as farm raised or rainforest certified, but listed as cruelty free... I pass it up. IT IS CRUELTY.
5801 2018-01-21 18:17:17 Peak oil is being reframed, in part so people like @chrisnelder can distance themselves from their loony predictions of a decade ago.

5804 2018-01-21 18:17:07 I once did the calculation that compared the weight of the atmosphere with the weight of CO2 annually produced by coal/oil/gas, just to check (& using industry published numbers). It was ~3%. Also, expert opinion has CO2 residency at a few years, not the 100s claimed by the IPCC.
5805 2018-01-21 18:16:58 im gonna do an olive oil treatment on my hair :)))
5806 2018-01-21 18:16:54 Tried to do a food shop today with no palm oil. So difficult, it’s appalling how many brands still use it. #stopdeforestation

5812 2018-01-21 18:15:51 The debate was not about whether oil was finite or infinite, you have to go to really loony fringes to find people who think oil isn't a fossil fuel, like flat earthers.

It was whether or not production would follow a normal distribution, reach a peak and enter terminal decline.
5813 2018-01-21 18:15:46 Stir together 2 1/2 pints celery with 2 cups hot dogs. Mix in Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve with a nice chianti.
5814 2018-01-21 18:15:38 You should add protecting our beaches from oil drilling to your platform. I’m sure the surfers and beach front residents will like that.
5815 2018-01-21 18:15:25 You still in the oil business?
5816 2018-01-21 18:15:22 Some girls will turn to chef fregz in the hostel and start bleaching palm oil disturbing the whole floor 
5817 2018-01-21 18:15:15 i used garnier nutrisse in the shade light natural blonde! it’s super nice bc it comes with an oil blend you mix in with the dye. i also prewashed my hair with head and shoulders to get as much color as i could
5818 2018-01-21 18:15:02 Where oil heading ???
5819 2018-01-21 18:14:57 The intersection of peak oil and politics is interesting. Peak US oil occurred in or around 1970, and it was shortly after that that every side of the political spectrum began throwing the waged class into the bonfire. Peak world oil around 2005 began the same project globally.

5822 2018-01-21 18:14:19 Your skin just feels so good after you put it on. It’s like a layer of velvet. Also it’s oil free so at least for me it takes a while before I’m oily.

5867 2018-01-21 18:06:50 Socialism didn't cause the Middle Eastern oil crisis. And inflation was double digits when Labour took over from the Tories. They actually reduced it. It's like blaming Obama for the financial crisis.

Methane also has 86x the destruction CO2 has which is set to increase by 60% by 2030.

5893 2018-01-21 18:01:35 I went to get an oil change and this guy tried to get my number and I’m like man I’m not looking for ur number. I’m looking for a damn oil change. Can you just do that??
5894 2018-01-21 18:01:28 Agreed. The thing that's always bugged me about Serena is she never gets her due. W/ all due respect to Billie, Martina, Evert, Graf & Seles, none played in an era with as many good players as Williams.

5926 2018-01-21 17:57:28 Well maybe you should be advising @lisamurkowski on the issue since she sold you out to oil and gas for that #taxsham.
5927 2018-01-21 17:57:18 Yeah when the accuracy needs to be within particular restraints to deploy millions of dollars at a really good guess of where oil is.

5931 2018-01-21 17:57:05 You will be giving Assad the oil if you do that. That's why they area attacking Afrin. Just for that response. We have a rule: Don't ever withdraw from an oil field.
5932 2018-01-21 17:56:53 Obama's Clean Power Plan was written by power plant engineers who knew that you could reduce C02 by 30% simply by forcing everyone to use combined cycle which has a lower heat rate. This was an executive action sponsered by Oil and Gas companies via EPA.

5937 2018-01-21 17:56:05 Get some activated charcoal and coconut oil. Works better than any whitening kit and its all natural.
5938 2018-01-21 17:55:58 You have also terminated much needed safety and environmental regulations. Wanting to drill off our beautiful costs, getting rid of funds used for drilling disasters & getting rid of safety regulations for oil drilling is just one example. #ExxonValdez #deepwaterHorizon oil spill
5939 2018-01-21 17:55:46 Also may I recommend the best moisturizer/scrub- lemongrass oil, coconut oil, almond oil and either brown sugar or coffee. It literally saved my skin this summer!

5941 2018-01-21 17:55:41 The BP oil spill was cleaned up by BP. You’re State got money from BP for any damages. You’re State depends on cheap reliable energy. So what’s your point?
5942 2018-01-21 17:55:35 Dear #WomensMarch2018, in all sincerity, what exactly have you resisted in a year that's worthy of celebration?

National parks for oil/gas drilling
Puerto Rico without power
Mass layoffs
Freezing schools...
5943 2018-01-21 17:55:21 Dear sir, just a small correction. KSA is by far the biggest supplier of terrorist. Is also has no parlement and elections as opposed to the republoc if Iran. Maybe a good idea to buy more oil from the Iranians ans less from KSA? Then you are also free to make correct statements
5944 2018-01-21 17:55:16 It's not too late to moisturize! Some creams or even things like coconut oil :) Every night before bed for sure, but also after washing your face in general
5945 2018-01-21 17:55:07 The Guardian.....laughable.
They’re divesting because Russian natural gas and Saudi oil is more lucrative. Yes, coal is on the decline, but because it is an anachronism....not because of “climate change”.
5946 2018-01-21 17:54:43 it most certainly will. Sometimes I wonder what exactly is achieved by such crazy viewpoints-in times when we need to look after the workforce, not pour oil on fire.
5947 2018-01-21 17:54:43 One yr on yr diff for Oilers not talked about.  Exactly how much juice all the Oiler reunions gave the current team last yr.  The example set, the confidence, the love for team, the pride, the encouragement, the being part of a greater whole.  More '80's Oil around the better.

5964 2018-01-21 17:51:41 Risk and reward. Yes oil spills are a possibility but think of all the jobs it will create and the amount of economic growth it’ll produce in your state. Fisherman from all over the country will come and pay to stay in hotels and marinas and buy many items creating revenue.

Too many people talking down the rally for it to be over IMO
5970 2018-01-21 17:50:36 And how did you get to Paris Mark. Fly in a plane using hydrocarbons hypocrite. You have such an issue with oil and gas yet you use 100 times more than an average citizen.

5992 2018-01-21 17:48:43 Democrats gave the Russians unilateral missile disarmament in Poland, Crimea, Eastern Ukraine, uranium, no accountability in Syria, and no competion for oil and gas. The notion that Russians prefer Democrats is simply absurd.

5995 2018-01-21 17:48:20 If you got job offer from "JAMEEL MOUSTAFA" of "Topaz oil and gas" it is totally FAKE JOB OFFER. Never send the money needed for visa or something or CV or references. Unfortunately I already sent my data.
5996 2018-01-21 17:48:10 I'm guessing but I assume Real is referring to the smell of cheap cleaning supplies and/or the smell of bleach in the bedding. I could never stand that, one reason I always brought my own pillow case sprayed with tiny bit of lavender oil.
5997 2018-01-21 17:47:54 Have to agree with DocH on this one. Somebody been trying to pump #EQT for a couple of weeks, but fail to explain the negatives. Looks like some holders want to sell, and need to pump it for others to buy their shares.

6007 2018-01-21 17:46:14 How about less filthy rich celebrities in office and more people who make their own breakfast. (Especially celebrities who promote snake oil salesmen and harmful dieting to millions of American women). We can do better.

6152 2018-01-21 17:23:56 If you have enough muscle to have visible abs, shouldn’t be a big deal. More muscle = higher metabolism = needs more food for fuel. However, eating processed crap is a large part of the zombification and decreased critical thinking abilities of liberals. #stayaway
6153 2018-01-21 17:23:51 Kuna kitabu kinaitwa BLOOD AND OIL. Mimi nadhani most of African problems when it comes to leadership kunakua na external influence nyingi sana. Na haya yote ni sababu ya misaada

6156 2018-01-21 17:23:37 I'll have to look into one of those. Do you use much oil?
6157 2018-01-21 17:23:29 I guess I need to get me some more of this coconut oil. I only have a small little bottle of it.

6163 2018-01-21 17:22:23 I think I heard Dr Rhonda Patrick  @foundmyfitness say on @joerogan that if you add a little black pepper, it helps activate some other chemistry in the turmeric to boost even more. I just take turmeric supplement every morning and fish oil capsule.
6164 2018-01-21 17:22:10 @autozone your canoe creek st. Cloud fl store CS sucks lines are long, dropping off oil you have to wait till they take care of all paying customer's. Employee calling customer sweetheart and not sir or miss. Retraining needed.

6166 2018-01-21 17:22:00 What does that have to do with the U.S.? Nothing, most oil producing countries in the mid East and other places encourage bribes
6167 2018-01-21 17:21:51 Its ironic that a country that invaded Iraq on a complete lie of WMD and then stole that country's oil wants to call Iran evil...a country that hasn't invaded anywhere over 100 years
6168 2018-01-21 17:21:50 Are y’all still out here thinking coconut oil is a moisturizer? It’s not get off cosmo

6226 2018-01-21 17:14:08 Would you believe this statement from the same article "the  rapid rise in American shale oil production creates the risk of a price drop below $50."?
6227 2018-01-21 17:13:58 But is this looting...these revenue are going to both state and central govt fund...why Punjab and karntaka are not cutting tax ...they can not ..nor the central govt..because oil has been a great source of revenue since independence...
6228 2018-01-21 17:13:55 In past oil price downturns this wasn't the same attitude. The NDP can say all the BS they want. Alberta is being kicked while down.

6245 2018-01-21 17:12:20 The fall in oil price is used for improvement of infrastructure where contractors had left the work n ran away during UPA. The amount is utilised in right way for ppl.

6248 2018-01-21 17:11:41 Not surprised! No Concerte plans to develop the oil sector. FG is quick to ask states to provide cattle colonies but can’t pass laws to improve the oil&gas sector. So sad. Opportunities are wasted. Maybe when oil drops to $10pb then we will increase production.

6258 2018-01-21 17:10:39 Okay. Now that we've come to the price of oil, you appreciate that oil has not been selling at a decent level, which has had a huge effect on AB's economy, or no? You're also saying that the previous Conservative regime mistakenly assumed oil would continue going up forever?

6273 2018-01-21 17:08:43 The fact that the last video of Bigfoot, or whatever he is called, was on “truth about cancer” says it all. It’s just a collection of cranks and crooks selling snake oil to fools who don’t realise they’re competing in the Darwin awards for stupidest cause of death

6283 2018-01-21 17:07:41 The pipelines were not really needed when oil was being sold at a decent level and not being attacked by foreign funded eco-groups. Wasn't worth the political capital to move on that front.

6435 2018-01-21 16:47:33 @sidlal you guys can make lot and lot of money if you improve your service mechanics, mechanism and work on ABS, dripping Engine oil, poor pathetic and cheap spares, vibration on handle bar is a health hazard. New model and such kits can only work when customers feel confident
6436 2018-01-21 16:47:23 Yeah, maybe canola oil, I heard it keeps the skin moisturized. 
6437 2018-01-21 16:47:22 . Chamisa is honourable man; can't go with u mile. Water and oil wont mix
6438 2018-01-21 16:47:17 Gummy hair skin & nail vitamins, Jamaican Black Castor Oil, & Wild Growth Oil ... I did use Hairfinty vitamins when I first big chopped, it helped a lot as well

6444 2018-01-21 16:46:23 Oil on water
6445 2018-01-21 16:46:14 This is a city that pumps raw sewage into a waterway and prefers Middle East oil to Canadian oil and votes consistently liberal. So yes it is perfectly believable.

6453 2018-01-21 16:45:08 I guess they haven't heard of beeswax and the finest olive oil as a deterrent.
6454 2018-01-21 16:45:04 If control of the land is given back to the tribes they should be given the choice to choose what industries they want. Hemp production could prove to be a bigger industry than extracting natural resources. I grew up in southern Oklahama. We ran cattle on NDN oil lease property.
6455 2018-01-21 16:44:41 Some oils are heavier on the skin than others. It’s good for your body like your legs or arms (also your hair) but your face is a little more sensitive and if you do use coconut oil it shouldn’t be used too often
6456 2018-01-21 16:44:33 And inspected and oil change and air in your tires
6457 2018-01-21 16:44:29 I be trying to tell so many ppl coconut oil is overhyped but no one listens 
6458 2018-01-21 16:44:28 Simply not true. Believe what you want (and before you get carried away like Rosa, I didn't vote for the NDP), NO politician in AB is naive enough to think oil and pipelines aren't an important part of AB's economy, and by the way, you did not answer my question. You deflected.

6468 2018-01-21 16:43:45 Interesting article in today’s NY Times about retirement of T Boone Pickens. For those of us who came of age in law & finance in the 1980s, the name T Boone Pickens is iconic. His epic corporate battle over Gulf Oil in 1983 helped shape modern day investing.
6469 2018-01-21 16:43:41 I need baking soda, lemons and coconut oil. It’s time to step things up a notch.
6470 2018-01-21 16:43:21 There's some weird thinking there. Paper comes from trees that take only a few decades to replace and once paper has been used it composts and returns to the soil to feed the next generation of trees. Plastic is made from oil that took million of years to make and cannot compost!

6480 2018-01-21 16:41:48 The new tax law — which slices corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 21 percent, slashes estate taxes and includes a special deduction for oil and gas investors — is expected to save the Koch brothers and their businesses billions of dollars in taxes.
6481 2018-01-21 16:41:25 @TiresPlus tell me how I had an appointment for an oil change at 10am & return at 11:45am to pick up my car and it hasn’t been done yet. Absolutely atrocious service. All it needs is an oil change.
6482 2018-01-21 16:41:12 This shit head is no leader he’s a snake oil salesman and nothing more
6483 2018-01-21 16:40:54 i spilled baby oil all over my bathroom counter and now it smells like a BIG GREASY BABY
6484 2018-01-21 16:40:51 The two main ingredients in 700g of digestives - wheat flour 70% @ $195 per ton and palm oil ~20% @ $635 per ton don't even get you to 20p.
6485 2018-01-21 16:40:51 So, these are everyday, most more than once a day. Then there are a couple others, this is just what I picked up at the pharmacy last week, and the high cbd cannabis or topical oil, and I have a ketamine cream and lidocaine patches...but the weed oil works WAY better than those.
6486 2018-01-21 16:40:48 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
6487 2018-01-21 16:40:37 Nigeria is one of the top producers of crude oil in the world but we're still importing crude oil produce 57 years after gaining Independence.
Later when they call us 'shit hole' nation, some of you will be doing like worm that they poured salt on top.
6488 2018-01-21 16:40:26 The GRID IS THE NEW OPEC.

NOT you.  
NOT me.  

Guess who?  

The MEGA RICH, and they want you to be their SLAVES.  

Electron cartels instead of oil cartels.  Same nonsense, theft, and abuse of power (pun intended).  Why?  You ignore better of options?

6491 2018-01-21 16:40:18 Went back to using coconut oil as a nightly moisturizer. It has done wonders for my skin. I feel like the simpler I go with my skincare, the more grateful my skin is and the more it behaves.
6492 2018-01-21 16:40:17 I found this oil that'll grow the shit outta your hair
6493 2018-01-21 16:40:14 You want the anointing but you don't know the pressing I've had to endure for this oil, you don't know what I've had to go through & the only reason I am the way that I am is because of GOD.

6495 2018-01-21 16:39:54 What you should be saying is that Canada allows it’s citizens to have a voice in energy policy instead of only the mega rich oil companies and execs controlling most govts.
6496 2018-01-21 16:39:48 Could our president "cause" $80 oil?  No he cannot...but economics 101 teaches that supply and demand could.

6503 2018-01-21 16:38:04 I hate getting my oil change because mechanics always wanna take advantage of the fact that you’re a girl.
6504 2018-01-21 16:37:54 It'll miss us. I changed the oil in my snow thrower yesterday. A sure jinx on any significant snowfall.

6506 2018-01-21 16:37:40 Good place to drop a bomb. Their last great idea was to overrun Europe with refugees.
6507 2018-01-21 16:37:34 Mr. Ambassador, as you are aware, oil & natural gas exports are Yemen's essential hard currency earners, and as long as gov't is 'prevented' from resuming such exports, talking about building trust between "hungry, desperate" people and a "bankrupt, corrupt" state is sadly futile
6508 2018-01-21 16:37:24 I need to find new hair products or sum cause the oil i be using dont look like it do shit 
6509 2018-01-21 16:37:15 oil paints are changing my life
6510 2018-01-21 16:37:13 There is also a hint that the numbers could be the ship name like 88, 180, 197 or 110. I also got oil tanker and air planes. Could be distractions. My friend might be carried by a truck in a box.
6511 2018-01-21 16:36:58 It is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil. More and more of our imports are coming from overseas.
6512 2018-01-21 16:36:57 At least they are using hydrogenated vegetable oil and not a shortening made of animal fat.
6513 2018-01-21 16:36:54 Oil paintings by Stanislaw Krupp Art

6514 2018-01-21 16:36:48 The science does not support that, and Eucalyptus oil is actually poisonous pretty quickly.
6515 2018-01-21 16:36:44 always loved the Oil Barons Ball scenes...especially the Bobby Ewing tribute made by Jeremy Wendell
6516 2018-01-21 16:36:32 We've got past survival so the dynamics have changed. The biggest problem with capitalism is it rewards bad behaviour and I don't see any discussions around it. I just see economists selling snake oil, or is it just me that sees it like that

6518 2018-01-21 16:36:22 Hey Benny, this shutdown, like the last one, is caused by Republicans wanting to hurt a sector of America. And Zinke is an oil company shill
6519 2018-01-21 16:36:18 After 300,000 miles I've decided that besides gasoline and oil changes, no other $ is going into my car. Should I get the same thing or go for a pickup?

6531 2018-01-21 16:34:45 I think they mean sweet almond oil (the only other kind of almond oil is bitter almond oil).

Sweet oil is more beneficial for moisturizing the skin .
6532 2018-01-21 16:34:28 Мне понравилось видео "Мои работы .Живопись маслом. My drawings. Oil painting."
6533 2018-01-21 16:34:27 No it isn't. The oil and coal industries have pumped trillions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere raising global temperatures which causes  positive feedback loops creating hurricane storms. Oil industry is complicit in climate change.

6584 2018-01-21 16:28:23 So 4/15 from EU and one a member of EFTA. The rest predominantly tiny oil rich states. Looks like EU doing well.
6585 2018-01-21 16:28:20 El audiolibro es con su voz, no?
6586 2018-01-21 16:28:09 We need visionary leaders, not all these clueless and inept people that call themselves leaders. South Africa that can't even stand with us shoulder to shoulder in terms of oil production, have more than 5 refineries.
6587 2018-01-21 16:28:05 Everytime I come get a oil change I end up paying for some extra shit lmao 
6588 2018-01-21 16:28:02 Several years back the not yet President Trump stated oil shouldn't be more than $10 a barrel.
6589 2018-01-21 16:27:55 How can this be? Didn't the big oil companies tell us that 'Electric' is not a proven alternative source of energy.
6590 2018-01-21 16:27:51 Oil is over-priced. At least $ 6 out of the $69 price of Brent is speculative premium.
6591 2018-01-21 16:27:44 And the oil spill out near China is?

6593 2018-01-21 16:27:31 If the number of women dying in childbirth, (Texas) continue to grow, STD rates and breast cancer grow, toxins in our water, oil spills in our oceans and gun violence increase, as access to the voting booth shrink, economic prosperity will not be enough.

6603 2018-01-21 16:26:13 No, loud trainer at the gym. No. You're a snake oil salesman, your profession is a scam, you can at LEAST be courteous and quiet about.
6604 2018-01-21 16:26:03 How is allowed to export oil. It is bad word to be used

6615 2018-01-21 16:24:10 Well however much you can fit into a one ounce bottle. The ingredients are on the site I believe but vitamin c is like some super oil that fades scaring and grape seed keeps the acne away
6616 2018-01-21 16:23:41 I’m worried about the cracking!! My GSD had it sometimes in the cold. So I figured coconut oil would be good because it’s safe to ingest.
6617 2018-01-21 16:23:29 Getting my oil changed, and they're going to check my check engine light that turned on yesterday

6625 2018-01-21 16:22:18 If you can get your hands on some Thieves or OnGuard essential oil, put it in some hot tea w/ fresh ginger & honey, you’ll be right as rain. It’s my go-to every time. I also sip a fresh garlic, bone broth, and fresh ginger hot tea blended mix on the go.
6626 2018-01-21 16:22:03 Soooo the queues are back..... Smh. Only in an oil producing country like Nigeria.
6627 2018-01-21 16:21:59 Now it makes sense. @tomsegura wants to distance himself from the @BP_plc oil spills in the Gulf he caused #tryitout #louisianawall
6628 2018-01-21 16:21:54 “The anointing oil flows from you because the olive has been crushed”

You get your blessings and anointing when you’ve been crushed, down and out, pressured! #Givehimpraise
6629 2018-01-21 16:21:53 The ruler was hoping he would discover oil and joined three months later after initial results were negative.
6630 2018-01-21 16:21:47 Trudeau mocks them for selling oil for money.  Banks have waaay more money, and they just give it to you!  Billions for the asking!  And loans are way more environmentally friendly! Win-win!
6631 2018-01-21 16:21:42 I imagine a little bit of vermouth would be great in this, also(I’m not kidding) a couple drops of olive oil on top
6632 2018-01-21 16:21:21 Jonnie is the dorkest of dorks and I love it

6636 2018-01-21 16:21:08 I had a dream last night I was doing all this crazy shit and it was super intense and at one point I said, “I have coconut oil in my hair I need to wash out.” IN MY DREAM.
And if that ain’t the most “me” shit. Speaking of which, I have coconut oil in my hair I need to wash out.
6637 2018-01-21 16:21:03 They could use those planes that dispense pesticides and such, and just spray the entirety of SE Michigan with vegetable oil

6642 2018-01-21 16:20:31 I think if the future is going to judge us for being monsters, slavery, rampant sexual assault followed by attacking the victims, allowing our vulnerable to die from lack of available health care, and killing each other over oil and religion will top the list.
6643 2018-01-21 16:20:29 Hate them u go for an oil change they end up telling u about ya engine

6645 2018-01-21 16:19:56 Norway is a small country with huge oil reserves. There’s a reason the State can be so generous

6647 2018-01-21 16:19:42 He didn’t turn economy around, Obama’s did that! He is reaping Obama’s president.   George Bush got benefits for 2 years from Clinton years in office! Then boom the world about come to the end! What Trump has done is change oil and gas exploration laws, running the natural resour
6648 2018-01-21 16:19:42 Do oil free moisturizers with an SPF of at least 30 exist? Or do all moisturizers with SPF protection have oil in them?

6660 2018-01-21 16:17:51 You may very well be right.  But you don't KNOW that, and neither do I.  And neither does Torrance.  When the subject of the biography says (and I'm paraphrasing) "mate we've never met". You're selling snake oil.
6661 2018-01-21 16:17:49 Good vibes and some lavender oil.
6662 2018-01-21 16:17:30 The kind of people who voted for Trump are the same kind of people that buy ginsu knives and Slap-chops from TV commercials.  And steaks and hats and diplomas and condos from snake oil salesmen.
6663 2018-01-21 16:16:59 I used something similar - a “sensation” oil or some BS and begged @SouthernSirsPl to lick my clit to get it off. He did - when he could stop crying with laughter
6664 2018-01-21 16:16:56 TRAFFIC - Avoid Dutch Village & Joe Howe if you can. Accident between an oil tanker & a car - the tanker has Dutch Village blocked off.

6669 2018-01-21 16:16:16 whose genius idea was it to put coconut oil in a jar
6670 2018-01-21 16:16:05 United won 3 trophies last year. We won more titles than anyone in our history. We won more since 2008 (the year oil money took over City) including a Champions League.
6671 2018-01-21 16:16:02 Black seed oil for you hair & skin; it’s amazing regardless of your skin type, but it’s thick so if your hair is thin or oily, only use it for treatments. If your hair can stand it, after washing, before dying/ styling put it on your ends and work up; a little goes a long way.
6672 2018-01-21 16:15:52 Turkey's ruling family makes millions by selling ISIS' oil, and now that ISIS is beat, they invade to kill the forces that defeated ISIS.

Remind me why these guys are our allies?

6684 2018-01-21 16:13:25 Notley? I thought it was the corporations bailing on AB oil & gas industry & laying off professionals that did it. OPEC’s price squeeze on N American drilling was driving that. Luckily we have China buying up discount AB assets - be interesting to see how that plays out now.

6733 2018-01-19 23:56:20 Thank you for speaking out and for your courage in doing so
6734 2018-01-19 23:56:18 it is and I wud have preferred we kept him but I see Sanchez like RVP, he give us that edge, also I ca  see where Jose is taking us we r going to make a big buy in summer, n respect Wenger. We pay our own way. Unlike pep we ain't taking it up d arse wit oil money
6735 2018-01-19 23:55:56 Loved malt extract with cod liver oil when I was a kid
6736 2018-01-19 23:55:32 If I were the Titans I would have somehow found oil in Nashville just so I could keep this frigging helmet
6737 2018-01-19 23:55:10 Maybe they LIKE being exploited as sheep, Ken. And they ran out of Snake Oil.

6740 2018-01-19 23:54:46 Facial recovery oil for sure 
6741 2018-01-19 23:54:45 its mank, the taste of it .. like yano.. utterly mankly sh!tey medicine ever since cod liver oil..
6742 2018-01-19 23:54:38 Yo that oil slick looking nail is sick. Dope as fuck.
6743 2018-01-19 23:54:31 I don't know if this one is a bot or not, but a-Indonesia in our politics? and b-palm oil production, bad for enviroments and habitats. so, blocking.
6744 2018-01-19 23:54:22 Whomever wants Oil prices higher and has the money and influence to make it happen.
6745 2018-01-19 23:54:21 I hate that I always either smell like deep fried oil or spoiled milk. No in-between.
6746 2018-01-19 23:54:20 coconut water and coconut oil are essential! Thank me later..
6747 2018-01-19 23:54:13 Apply tea tree oil if you have it.
6748 2018-01-19 23:54:01 My  olive oil and Shea butter mix looks like gbegiri LOLOL
6749 2018-01-19 23:54:01 So sorry Will 
6750 2018-01-19 23:53:59 "Hmm... you could get the cookie sheet out and spray a bit of olive oil on it! Then we can put in the mix together~"

6753 2018-01-19 23:52:54 Are you tormented enough to volunteer to be incarcerated for the rest of your life.

6755 2018-01-19 23:52:18 Oh, I completely agree that last night it was Commr H-R going off the deep end v Chapman re: oil. That’s why I said “not even our issue”. But H-R’s slurs against Italian-Americans & union “thugs” last mtg was bigoted & abusive, period. Hope you’d agree.
6756 2018-01-19 23:51:54 First of all, pan fry the Brussels sprouts with olive oil, onion garlic & bacon. Secondly, roast the new potatoes with Parm. Lastly, feed the lil smokies to Fido and grill a two inch ribeye!

6758 2018-01-19 23:51:32 It's the best!! I saw a drastic difference when exfoliating this way before using a BHA (salicylic acid), which is the only oil soluble acid, so it literally washes out your pores from the inside. Dermaplane once every 2-3 weeks 
6759 2018-01-19 23:51:28 Hot bath shaved scrubbed and used me Jo Malone oil now in silky pjs I feel amazing

6778 2018-01-19 23:48:26 Pro tip: When cooking Indian food and the recipe says to stir diced onions in hot oil over medium heat for a few minutes until golden and/or brown, for best results "a few" probably means "20-30".
6779 2018-01-19 23:48:01 I checked my oil and topped it off once and then applied to trade school

6782 2018-01-19 23:47:40 Girl honestly I just season the fuck outta it & throw it in some oil lol

6784 2018-01-19 23:47:20 Olive oil takes lipstick off so well
6785 2018-01-19 23:47:14 Doubt it I just read an article saying that the US is gonna start to produce more oil than Russia and Saudi Arabia.

6787 2018-01-19 23:47:00 I am so sorry. Be kind to yourself. Both God and your child love and forgive you. Forgive yourself, friend. 
6788 2018-01-19 23:46:49 okie doke I'll be making something simple like egg whites at the start to see what flavor it imparts. I also picked up a bottle of pistachio oil at an Iranian specialty store that I am PSYCHED to try out.
6789 2018-01-19 23:46:48 That my skin is actually super sensitive & just needs ALL THE OILS. Why were we so obsessed with stripping the oil from our faces?! Ugh
6790 2018-01-19 23:46:36 Toh kaga anzo gurin

6794 2018-01-19 23:46:09 sometimes i be thinking when i get a oil change they dont be changing it. just taking my money
6795 2018-01-19 23:46:08 Trump says so.  He makes decisions with his own counsel and his "gut". And pays lawsuits for selling snake oil diploma's.
6796 2018-01-19 23:45:57 What is indefensible,  you idiots?? The U.S. oil boom? A healthy economy? The stock market? The new business friendly tax laws?

6803 2018-01-19 23:44:40 Explain how governments provide trillions in welfare to corporate welfare queens each year in ads - more than is spent on military, Social Security each year.  Welfare queens - banks, oil, coal, Comcast, Apple, prescription drugs, electricity, etc.  IMF Externalities on net
6804 2018-01-19 23:44:31 There is 2 oil veins in murder snow area na I've 468 that's bugged you can't place oil pump. This be fixed?
6805 2018-01-19 23:44:19 Lost faith in humanity reading some of the fuckwit tweets about this Sanchez deal. Anyone would take him in their team in a heartbeat.. you either can’t afford him coz you’ve no oil money or even if you do, you ain’t got the history/prestige #GGMU
6806 2018-01-19 23:44:14 any thoughts about avocado oil? I just bought a bottle for broiling, seeing that it had a higher smoke point

6809 2018-01-19 23:43:16 I love the description of the french tyre maker as 'spreading like an oil slick across Asia'...fine work.
6810 2018-01-19 23:43:16 The most "abusive" disagreement was unrelated to #righttowork It was between Holden-Rhodes & Chapman over the oil & gas ordinance. I agree it was unfortunate but it was between those two Commissioners. There were other pointed remarks on both sides, but not "abusive."

6813 2018-01-19 23:42:54 why the fuck would aliens actually want to take over earth? If they were so advanced to travel so far away to here, what the hell would they want?
oil? no. evident from their travel.
us? no. they are far more intelligent.
they have no reason to do anything bad. so stfu.
6814 2018-01-19 23:42:47 My favorite brand is the 'argan one n only'. It's at Sally's! It's $8 a bottle but lasts FOREVER. Their shampoos and conditioners are really nice too if your hair is dry or tangly. You'll notice a big difference after using the oil for a week
6815 2018-01-19 23:42:43 No state should be forced to jeopardize their coast line with oil spills, particularly since I doubt they will receive much of the benefit, if any, for the serious risk! Tired of this bully president & administration!
6816 2018-01-19 23:42:26 I just used Jamaican black castor oil and oh my gosh OMG does it smell amazing
6817 2018-01-19 23:42:14 If I had the same money my girls would have the opportunity to see the cultures of the world from the lense of a billionaire. Instead they have the lense of a soldier that says there is nothing redeeming on that side of the planet. We no longer need the oil.

Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
6821 2018-01-19 23:41:22 How dare you minimize his pain! I’m a woman who has faced this pain bc I thought I had no other choice! I killed my own child and his gf probably feels the same pain!
6822 2018-01-19 23:41:16 I don’t like what it’s called. WE are animals, and we deny it by calling non-humans “animals,” thereby giving us “permission” to exploit and torture them.
6823 2018-01-19 23:41:05 If we applied every snake oil they claim improves yield by xx% or xx by/a.c. the cumulative effect should pencil out to about 746 bu corn
6824 2018-01-19 23:41:01 Every time I pass by Lucas Oil, I miss Colts football even more.
6825 2018-01-19 23:40:41 i can't find anything that kills them either. ive tried diatomaceous earth, and most bugs hate mint oil but they're fucking omnipresent imo. nothing even bothers the stupid things.
6826 2018-01-19 23:40:37 She made a point. But shouldnt have made it in the public. He made her who she is today. He is the reason she is known worldwide as the first lady of this country. A woman must stand by her husband no matter what.
6827 2018-01-19 23:40:34 Had a haircut today that equated to a woman cutting odd chunks into my hair and smearing oil into it whilst it was dry... and I paid £18 for it... a man with no fucking thumbs could do a better job  came out with greasier hair then when I went in 
6828 2018-01-19 23:40:29 Whom are you calling stupid, I should say.
6829 2018-01-19 23:40:17 General Mattis says China and Russia are the biggest threat to America, as opposed to terrorism. Could it be because Russia is giving North Korea oil? Or because they he- NO COLLUSION
6830 2018-01-19 23:40:15 I cook like an insane person.  I don't use recipes. Just my vague understanding of ingredients and what works together.  
I've got lemon and pepper on the Cod, and oil, chili powder and Cajun seasoning on the wedges
I need to buy more spices. I'm just working with what is here
6831 2018-01-19 23:40:13 Absolute fucking nutter in my daughter's student house at Uni, things been building up but tonight he's put bleach & washing up liquid in everyone's food, cooking oil & w/up liquid in washer, toaster, oven & electric sockets, he's cut wires 1/2

6837 2018-01-19 23:39:59 #OnThisDay, 1996, a fire in the engine of a tugboat pulling the tank barge "North Cape" causes both to wash up on the coast of #RhodeIsland, spilling nearly a billion gallons of heating oil into Block Island Sound and the Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge. #DisasterADay
6838 2018-01-19 23:39:46 Add: Dealer network resistance, collapse of 85% of the ICE supply chain, collapse of oil demand, etc. These industries will not go quietly into that dark night.
6839 2018-01-19 23:39:37 Ok, I have no idea wtf people were smoking when they said the v1.0 oil ocean 2 trick saves 30 seconds

6850 2018-01-19 23:37:52 I agree the previous government was incompetent. I wonder how much debt hey hid from the Alberta voters! I bet the PC party and not the UPC are lucky they have the easiest job in the world, being in opposition while oil prices hit the bottom, so easy to blame the sitting NDP.

6855 2018-01-19 23:37:35 $70-$100 for a synthetic oil change. Lick my ass crack @pep boys & @jiffylube I thought it would cost more going to a dealership, but they actually charge A LOT less.
6856 2018-01-19 23:37:07 The oil works wonders. No high and pain free

6867 2018-01-19 23:35:22 Keep it trimmed and spritz some argan oil on it everyday. Not only is it great for your hair but its also a natural heat protectant if you style your hair. My hair is bleached and I swear by that stuff. It's amazing. I've used it for years 
6868 2018-01-19 23:35:21 As long as I don't burn the midnight oil stuffing things into boxes, printing out billions of labels and inserts and taping up plastic bags and being late to work from going to the post office i am happy!!

6878 2018-01-19 23:34:20 this isn't utility company in the new york area at all!!! this in afghanistan, as a oil refinery for mr hamid karzai, that isn't this fake man in a palm springs lawyer office pretended to be chris vader on tahquitz street!!!

6880 2018-01-19 23:34:13 Pretty usual. Obsessing over enforcing M/F tasks is often an indication that the person actually doesn’t believe gender diffs are real. I assume they are, so don’t sweat it over however “who changes the oil” falls out for individuals.

6882 2018-01-19 23:33:49 You know you're getting old when you get excited about a free oil change 
6883 2018-01-19 23:33:43 we should just start using industrial hemp instead of plastic. a completely reneweable source, that will take away most if not all pollution from plastic and oil
6884 2018-01-19 23:33:11 I wonder who will get the blame? An oil worker? A conservative? No it will be climate change for sure that’s it, that damn global warming made the steel so hot that it collapsed

6888 2018-01-19 23:32:14 @GovMurphy I just read of a 7 y/o with terminal cancer who would benefit from cannabis oil whose parents can only obtain the flower and then produce the oil themselves. This makes no sense. Please use your executive power to change this immediately for all who would benefit
6889 2018-01-19 23:32:02 'Please send: tea, coffee, olive oil, chocolate, rice, tinned vegetables and fish. Struggling to buy food because prices have gone up and afraid of asking for a referral to the food bank in case that might get me deported'. #FBPE

6898 2018-01-19 23:30:38 @realDonaldTrump I hope now that we do not depend on other country for drilling oil that our gasoline prices come down. That would help Americans so much!!!
6899 2018-01-19 23:30:19 Nothing to sneeze at, but you need to get the guns. And no, I don't believe the guns are been rubbed with Oil of Invisibility

6904 2018-01-19 23:29:28 Pffft.  How does your ex-girlfriend feel about it?  
What matters is her choice. Our part in conception is pretty minor.
For a lot of anti-abortion men, their position seems to be based on wanting to control their girlfriends.
6905 2018-01-19 23:29:16 I love this coffee place but $18 for Tide Pod toast is outrageous. The Calabrian chili oil and pepitas are nice, admittedly, but come on

6908 2018-01-19 23:28:44 Well Oil Changers said it might be a trans fluid leak, but nothing for certain. My dad's guy said they couldn't find anything to support it either way, only that there was for sure a coolant leak. Ford is saying there's a coolant leak as well.
6909 2018-01-19 23:28:20 Things Santa Donny is giving US they don't consider: undrinkable water, unbreathable air, toxic food, more frequent severe weather, animosity of former allies, jacked up fees to visit public lands while oil/mining corps are charged laughably low rates to destroy them --
6910 2018-01-19 23:28:20 Do not need anymore oil spills on our beaches and oceans. Stop the zinke idiot from pursuing this disaster.
6911 2018-01-19 23:28:18 Invest in research = stall any action as long as possible because I’m invested in oil and I want to make a quick $
6912 2018-01-19 23:28:15 You’re body is still trying to gather strength to get better and to function and work and it’s week from the flu. This flu is not like anything else out there.

6916 2018-01-19 23:27:38 “Bill Belichick stepping up to the podium to address the media is like Artie Lange doing standup at a feminist rally–the two go together like oil and water, like Tom Brady and trans-fat, like Aaron Rodgers and family reunions.” #beatquoteallday

6918 2018-01-19 23:26:51 I put a drop of lavender oil in my mascara tube, it’s moisturizing for your eyelashes and makes your mascara last longer! Then at night I put either Vaseline or coconut oil for a deep treatment.

6929 2018-01-19 23:25:17 Also extra virgin olive oil is ridiculously versatile. Put it on toast, on pasta, on salad, put it in soups, on vegetables, use it to cook vegetables or meat or what have you. I don't know if there's a more versatile oil out there that tastes good + is healthy
6930 2018-01-19 23:25:13 I’m doing laundry and I got coconut oil in my hair I’m about to make asparagus my life is great
6931 2018-01-19 23:25:06 Safety of Americans? Is that why you want to drill for oil on our beautiful coasts? Have you heard of oil spills? You could care less about our safety. Its all about the money for you.
6932 2018-01-19 23:25:06 And if you don’t strike oil in first 15 mins stop boring!!
6933 2018-01-19 23:24:58 So: burn oil, make money, And live in climate change denial.

6938 2018-01-19 23:24:12 @carleygarner Carley, I loved reading your Technical piece about oil in the Perspective newsletter you sent out today, thank you so much for sharing! On point as always! 
6939 2018-01-19 23:24:11 Oil price collapse followed Obama/Wall Street engineered oil bubble which drove 5m bpd new US oil production & 2m bpd less product use. Once QE ended oil price collapsed to $45/$50 per bbl as I forecast in 2011/12. Obama aim was resilience/energy security & freedom from Saudi

7028 2018-01-19 23:10:34 todo dermato olhava minha pele e já passava produtos em gel, sabonete em barra e protetor solar oil free. depois que passei a entender um pouco mais dessas coisas percebi que basicamente ressecavam minha pele e não hidratavam o suficiente, por isso SEMPRE sofria com efeito rebote

7058 2018-01-19 23:05:46 Trump not as smart as we think if he falls for snake oil salesman Graham.
7059 2018-01-19 23:05:30 I get the point you’re trying to make, but that’s not a guarantee either. Oil and gas market took a hit in 2014, lots of companies cut their dividends. You may make a 5% yield on your cash, but you’re sinking big $$ into someone else’s pocket for unrecoverable rent

7086 2018-01-19 23:02:01 Totally valid argument in the days before you had a reality TV star as President, an oil baron as Secretary of State, a technology investor heading up the Department of Education..

7089 2018-01-19 23:01:19 OTOH, if the market for collectible oil paintings leaves you with illiquid assets, all you can do is look at them. If underwater with ill-chosen "collectible" whiskey after the bubble bursts, you can still drink it.  Don't pay more than you're willing to open.
7090 2018-01-19 23:01:15 Sure. Trade is good, but it matters a lot who's doing it and under what laws. US trade deficits mostly mean that our exported dollars are being used to buy things not sold by the US (Oil for example). The deficit is a measure of both trade policy and global confidence in dollars.

Also one oil company is investing in SK, that's what you accomplished in 10 years as Premier. AB GDP growth > SK

7144 2018-01-19 22:54:29 Hi Mary, the gov. created a $1 billion absolute liability limit for some (>250,000 barrels per day) oil pipelines.

7163 2018-01-19 22:51:26 But wait.... how do Mar-a-lago members feel about Trump? How about oil companies, they happy? the KKK? we get any input from the GOP?
7164 2018-01-19 22:51:13 This doesn't counter the arguement that peak oil is coming.  Vehicle elctricfication is going to happen, it's just better.
7165 2018-01-19 22:51:09 Your story is the same as mine. To this day, the mother still refers to "Caleb".

7170 2018-01-19 22:50:17 my dream man spritzs margiela by the fireplace through the air and walks into it and washes his face with tatcha camilla oil and has a mans on the side supplying him clé de peau illuminating sheet masks come thru @diddy
7171 2018-01-19 22:50:09 Yes, what is the purpose?
Oil?

7173 2018-01-19 22:49:51 Richard Steiner said re: #Sanchi oil tanker disaster: "there’s a lot we don’t know about a major condensate spill since we’ve never seen one.” He described scenario where there's an “invisible, subsurface toxic plume that is spreading outward from the site.”
7174 2018-01-19 22:49:41 Sometimes you gotta roll around in oil and lotion for an hour to feel like you are worth something
7175 2018-01-19 22:49:19 But the important part is that the State owns the rubble, not some evil oil company.
7176 2018-01-19 22:49:18 لا انت عمله نادره ... غيرهم

7181 2018-01-19 22:48:51 Greenway on sustainable  community tour of Durham, with NFBPA, a part of their NSOE DEL ELI class. They stopped at Beyu Cafe, a donor of veggie oil to GOAL Site. We process it into fuel and bring people back to the very rest. Community Supported Energy, how cool is dat?!
7182 2018-01-19 22:48:47 And Nick soaks up all that oil with another championship trophy. Please predict our demise every year! 
7183 2018-01-19 22:48:30 When they have bought all other countries oil. They now want to control the market by selling theirs at high prices. I think they are smart enough.
7184 2018-01-19 22:48:24 i dont want your nudes unless they are drawn in oil pastels
7185 2018-01-19 22:48:05 For almost each semester I come up with courses I can actually study for MSc. In my 2nd year I thought about Accounting in Oil and Gas then came Money, Finance and Banking. Now I just want to be done with school.
7186 2018-01-19 22:48:05 On today’s episode of Becca Gets Her First Oil Change On Her Own, I asked them if I needed to stay in the car when they did it  
7187 2018-01-19 22:48:04 @MeridianFoods I love your peanut butters & your ethos on 'palm oil free' but please can you use a jars that don't  need a plastic seal on the lid?
7188 2018-01-19 22:48:02 Test run on a new cracker/flat bread variation worked beautifully: spelt and whole wheat flour, peanut oil, and flax seeds ground with a bit of tahini paste kneaded into the dough. Brushed after baking with garlic infused ghee. #yummmm
7189 2018-01-19 22:47:52 My loving boyfriend should get my oil changed for Valentine’s Day 
7190 2018-01-19 22:47:47 I find it incredibly insulting to the 1000’s of talented engineers and other Perron scientists in this city to roll them under the bus like this. Canadian oil and gas innovation is responsible for much of the cheap energy we enjoy today. Get your head out of your ass.
7191 2018-01-19 22:47:30 I went to an essential oil party for a girl from work, but I already know/use everything about essential oils so my role was to drink an entire bottle of Cabernet. 
7192 2018-01-19 22:47:29 welcome to oil painting class, where you have to buy like 15 tubes of paint and only 3 of them can cost $40
7193 2018-01-19 22:47:19 But still banks & oil control the world with our money. They have all the power we have none, we just elect their hired puppets. Lies,deceit & corruption but what a surprise we have found you out,the game is up. long live the truth & Corbyn
7194 2018-01-19 22:47:17 Or oil services could finally gobble up some of that cash flow

7197 2018-01-19 22:46:58 Water really is and will become the new oil. Wales is lucky enough to be in a part f the world where it is abundant. Imagine a world where water can be used as an asset like oil. Look you can see it's happening.
7198 2018-01-19 22:46:50 How about you get rid of everything that involved oil and/or gas to get to you, or keep you warm. Naked and afraid is what you would be.

7202 2018-01-19 22:46:28 The biggest failure of this administration is coal. We have went back 10 years. The Chinese are dumping all their money into renewable energy. And they will be free of oil. And be selling the best technology for renewable energy. That should be Americas biggest focus.

7204 2018-01-19 22:46:07 Venezuelan people are now literally starving — about three-quarters of the population lost weight last year. Oil exports are dropping daily due to mismanagement. Something is broken..I hope the leadership can fix it soon!
7205 2018-01-19 22:45:59 feeling really anxious so my boyfriend packed my bong and booted up the essential oil diffuser

7209 2018-01-19 22:45:39 The #1 industry in FL is tourism & all of that, other than Disney, is on the 1600 miles of coastline. #2 industry is real estate, large part due to tourists moving here to enjoy nature & live on a coastline. Spill oil & kill wildlife & all that is gone. & the seafood industry.

7225 2018-01-19 22:43:38 Oh here we go with a the other possible maybe word; “can”. This is used to keep America dependent on foreign oil suppliers. We do not need to be dependent on others. Not anymore. We dont need foreign oil supplies dictating what we are to pay for oil. Done with opec prison pricing
7226 2018-01-19 22:43:21 Tech is the new oil..

7233 2018-01-19 22:42:51 The oilfield is the best / worst thing people can choose to do career wise. I seen my parents loose everything when I was young when oil hit $10 a barrel. It was terrible.

7251 2018-01-19 22:39:35 A while back crude oil prices went down 50%, because of the middle east cold war and in Uganda nothing changed. But now that crude is up they are claiming it is the reason why we can't drive as we want #shithole

7260 2018-01-19 22:38:29 Anyone who can remember WW2 or the aftermath will vote No for totally irrational reasons. Scottish nationhood all but disappears at times of war like 1914 and 1939, without those wars Scotland would have been independent decades ago imo enjoying the fruits of oil like Norway.
7261 2018-01-19 22:38:23 May last year's disappointments, pains, trials and sufferings, be what causes you to pour out your BEST worship, praise, dance, prayer life, songs, oil, hope, faith and expectations, in THIS year (2018), in the name of Jesus Christ, AMEN.
7262 2018-01-19 22:38:07 I was kidding about actually getting Baxter Taco Bell breakfast. All the foods I give him are extremely natural and have no added dyes, oil, artificial ingredients, or anything else toxic to doggies. :3
7263 2018-01-19 22:38:03 No problem i was shocked in my studies years ago when i found out the truth what really started WWII with the USA and Japan.  Nanjing just tip of ice berg. The oil is what started it the embargo and deep sanctions hit japans economy greatly.

7266 2018-01-19 22:37:44 Veggies require machinery , which requires oil. How about reducing your carbon footprint and only eat that which you grow and harvest manually?
7267 2018-01-19 22:37:44 clove oil is good.

7275 2018-01-19 22:36:23 So then, if you say science is on our side, you agree that global warming is a thing, correct! Oil drilling off our beaches is a very bad thing, correct? Mining filthy coal and fossils fuels are a bad thing, correct? Alternate energy and solar are good things, correct?
7276 2018-01-19 22:36:23 That awkward moment when you were gonna make fried Oreos & when you got home your brother used the last of the cooking oil.
7277 2018-01-19 22:36:21 I’m not crazy about strong scents either. I like anything with amber or sandalwood, as long as it’s not overdone. Also, Victoria’s Secret has a body oil/wash line called Weightless. The Shea butter scent is nice. You’d love it if you like vanilla!

7280 2018-01-19 22:35:58 I wouldn't understand how to drink it. You probably have to mix it with engine oil and meringue or something.
7281 2018-01-19 22:35:54 Fresh Brussel sprouts cut in half, cooked in a skillet with bacon cut into small pieces, with fresh minced garlic, a little olive oil and butter, salt and pepper to taste is hard to beat!!!

7285 2018-01-19 22:35:29 @EcoFuelNWF  looks like NWF wants more polluting oil and non renewable hydrocarbons that fill the planet full of pollution, closes beaches and fills the heartland with oil saturated land. Umm they may want to rethink their position
7286 2018-01-19 22:35:20 Tired of paying 70$ for an oil change 
7287 2018-01-19 22:35:15 No I did not. I also blamed Labour. I also said that if Miners were paid the market adjusted rate during oil crisis then they might not have gone on strike.
Unions played huge role in bringing the UK to its knees even under a Labour government.
Unions wouldnt accept pay restraint
7288 2018-01-19 22:35:09 cool kate has now decided we are still pumpin oil the word unsustainable literally means that you cannot sustain it.

7303 2018-01-19 22:33:11 Yeah ya know like the largest spill in history with BP on our gulf coast. Let’s not pretend that’s not effectively tainted the gulf forever. We have not forgotten and nobody wants this...except people who think this will somehow unwed us to foreign oil imports. Inform yourself
7304 2018-01-19 22:33:03 Will had one of the most poignant tweets of thw day, and you solious had the worst!

You had the choice to shut up, but you just couldn't 

I was already praying for Will to find peace, and will now also pray for you.  Please get well, sounds like you could use peace.

7313 2018-01-19 22:32:13 From the person driving a gas and rubber plastic car, heating home with oil, wearing rubber on shoes, and putting mountains of plastic in the landfill lol

7316 2018-01-19 22:32:02 Blame Republicans.  Passed tax billions give trillions in welfare to Corporate Welfare Queens - banks, oil, coal, Comcast, Apple, Facebook, prescription drugs, etc which will cause local govs and state governments to increase their taxes. IMF Externalities.
7317 2018-01-19 22:31:54 in honor of #nationalpopcornday let me state for the record that in our house all popcorn is cooked over a flame burner in a whirly pop with coconut oil. Yum.

7324 2018-01-19 22:31:02 I think you’re leaking oil. Might want to have that looked at...
7325 2018-01-19 22:30:47 Calcula cuanto cuesta el litro de cerveza o gaseosa y veras que es barato el precio del gas oil en comparación con esos productos.
7326 2018-01-19 22:30:34 Great week overall  All positions green, which is definitely not the norm. This is the first week in 6 that $GOLD, $GDX, and $OIL put in a red week & $USD put in a bullish pin bar weekly candle at support. Betting commodities pullback next week but if not stops are in place

7332 2018-01-19 22:29:38 Guerrero is the great snake oil salesman to ever live.
7333 2018-01-19 22:29:33 Customers come to the health store  where I work asking if we sell 1) Vitamin B17 / Apricot kernels & 2) Black seed oil. When I ask why they claim these can cure cancer. We cannot discuss cancer for liability reasons & don't sell these. Heard about them for four yrs, any truth?
7334 2018-01-19 22:28:46 اعدلك ... بس متتعبش
7335 2018-01-19 22:28:44 Meanwhile the inflation-adj price of oil is 3x that in 1970, and world population has doubled.
7336 2018-01-19 22:28:42 "Its time to oil up !"
7337 2018-01-19 22:28:37 @torimiller314 i love oil
7338 2018-01-19 22:28:33 But...but...she cares deeply for that hair under her oppressive hijab!! 
@L'OrealParis
7339 2018-01-19 22:28:22 I don't believe the gold/oil ratio has ever been a consideration for any money authority. It was until 1971 simply an outcome of dollar pricing for oil & the unsustainable & misconceived gold standard for the dollar.
7340 2018-01-19 22:28:05 Yes we know. Enjoy the next 112 years.

7348 2018-01-19 22:27:26 Me too tbh. I mean we saw the oil on it when he killed Roberto, but blood would look great yes. Please make a mini horror movie Rhett and Link. Or just a sketch.....
7349 2018-01-19 22:27:22 Which we have contributed inordinate amounts to.

How do you think they got the money for Right to Buy? North Sea oil was squandered on making working class people vote Conservative, rather than securing our children’s future.
7350 2018-01-19 22:27:20 In response to that pic, just living in this area and breathing the air here is shortening our lifespans by twenty years so yes, bring on that oil.

7390 2018-01-19 22:19:28 “There’s no oil left” been hearing this since the 80s !! F ing liars
7391 2018-01-19 22:19:19 Like do you see any reason that commodities generally would not start to catch a bid? Grains in particular are in the tank. IMO they are just waiting for a small S/D disruptive event. Drought etc. Beans, bean oil, meal, wheat are building a multi year base.

7402 2018-01-19 22:18:36 The Trump administration's proposal to open up waters off almost the entire coast of the US to oil and gas drilling prompted howls of protests from environmentalists.  Few observers think energy companies will operate in much of the area. - The Economist

7414 2018-01-19 22:16:55 Harper and Rait deregulated the train lines to make it cheaper to transport oil , so you can thinks it’s Chrétien fault , but 47 people died so Harper could transport oil cheaper .

7421 2018-01-19 22:16:32 Sarcasm, friend. People need to see him for what he is. A snake oil salesman who has no idea what he’s actually doing. He just uploaded a video of him “daytrading.” Hilarious if people weren’t actually losing money Bc of him.
7422 2018-01-19 22:16:23 did some painting in acrylics years ago. Like it more than oil, less messy.
7423 2018-01-19 22:16:20 Growing middle class across the globe is driving energy demand. For next 25 years, oil remains the primary fuel to meet this demand, with gas growing the most. #MeetAlaska18 #akleg
7424 2018-01-19 22:16:14 The only negligence here was from the money grubbing corporate officers (whores/murderers) who implemented one man train crews despite knowing the safety risks.  One man cannot safely transport 100 carloads of crude oil.  You would think that is self evident.
7425 2018-01-19 22:16:10 Vera is mad at me for drinking Steve’s beard oil. Being an idiot gets me in trouble sometimes
7426 2018-01-19 22:16:00 One of the big causes of the shift is probably that King Salman and MBS recognized that they cannot rely on oil much longer and must shift to a diversified high tech economy with highly educated men AND WOMEN. They have no choice.
7427 2018-01-19 22:15:55 I promise the combo (with olive oil and salt; fan out the leaves) is divine. I throw it around the pan like confetti and brown all together
7428 2018-01-19 22:15:38 The part where financial institutions have less regulations to control their endless greed. The part where there have been 54 coal miners killed since trump lowered safety regulations. The BS that is oil drilling off are coastlines.

7430 2018-01-19 22:15:23 Why does the relative warmness of the oil matter in this equation? Just give me some pizza.
7431 2018-01-19 22:15:19 That analysis is flawed, there's no such "oil abundance". Shale economics require $60-75 in the USA, higher prices elsewhere @El_Spy
7432 2018-01-19 22:15:18 AMEN sister! & we happen to think @realDonaldTrump is doing a FANTASTIC job! In fact, we R now said to be the Dominant Oil producer in the world, in only a year!! This is why DEMS R mad, they bought stock in foreign oil while voting to keep America from being energy independent.
7433 2018-01-19 22:14:53 Hey Donald Trump, you're stupid to open up more gas/oil drilling. Filling your pockets at America's expense once again#! You're slipping as usual and need canned. You really duped the coal miners. Proud of your dumb ego#?

7449 2018-01-19 22:12:25 I hope this will bring the long awaited change into the oil business system
7450 2018-01-19 22:12:13 ¿ ya le sacó el subsidio al Gas -Oil Tabare o aun tiene chucho y no se anima ? Ah, claro como se va a animar si Salgado esta al lado de el. Como presidente de Cutcsa es el GRAN BENEFICIADO y lo paga toda la Ruralidad del pais. Cuatro pesos por litro ¿ y Martinez, que dice ?
7451 2018-01-19 22:11:56 We're on literally the only #Thameslink train out of St Panc tonight. Have the world's smelliest food eater behind me. Thank God for olbas oil drenched tissues.
7452 2018-01-19 22:11:49 do females check their oil? 
7453 2018-01-19 22:11:40 Baby oil !
7454 2018-01-19 22:11:40 I’m sure you’re a quare oil painting
7455 2018-01-19 22:11:38 Thank you! Our use of the word was for the gap in scheduled barrels. Worth noting that crude oil gives you fewer barrels per tonne than gas condensates.

7458 2018-01-19 22:11:18 I am going to a beauty spa tonight. To soak in seaweed and oil and exfoliate in a salt room. So I will be salty. Love a massage. Looking forward to it!
7459 2018-01-19 22:11:12 We'll sure Rockefellers were the founders of the pharmaceutical industry and associated w/oil. They R loaded with money till the end of time& the Rockefellers are corrupt as can be.
Just like the corrupt Rothschilds that founded the corrupt Federal Reseve

7464 2018-01-19 22:10:10 RT @LivingSafely: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this January? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!
7465 2018-01-19 22:10:09 Agreed. Check their following (or lack thereof).
7466 2018-01-19 22:10:08 I guess that's why he wants all that off-shore drilling.  Have enough oil spills and you'll kill all the sharks (along with all the other life in the ocean).
7467 2018-01-19 22:10:06 Sadly both GM's didn't need to do a ton of work, fill needed holes. Honestly both seemed like simple fixes. How Chiarelli turned simple into impossible,

7470 2018-01-19 22:09:49 I'm informing very serious concern regarding to cooking"Pork"in same fry-pan,as a Muslim our community respect to those who want to eat port but we cannot share same fry-pan for cooking eggs and pork in same oil. We have raised our concern with the chef. Show some respect.

7471 2018-01-19 22:09:49 You know what the gas chamber smell like. Pine oil.

7473 2018-01-19 22:09:29 Christ Amen. I hate this mentality. That Western Nations need to nanny other Nations. It just doesn't make sense. I've been to Africa.  So much oil. So much land and ambition but nothings happening. It's irritating.  We, as humans, have so much potential but no
7474 2018-01-19 22:09:23 #FF @Lisa_Ward1990 the oil freak who is seemingly an undercover metalhead! 
7475 2018-01-19 22:09:17 I slipped in some warm oil during an important sports moment. It kept us from going to state 
7476 2018-01-19 22:09:08 That’s on your employer, your government, and oil companies.
7477 2018-01-19 22:09:08 Yeah, definitely try and open the casing. I just meant if you can't (or can't be arsed) WD40 or 3-in-1 Oil might help.

Your best bet is probably to open the casing and use some kind of silicone grease on the mechanism. That'll last longest.
7478 2018-01-19 22:09:05 You see Mexico wanting to help? NOPE.
Mexico's #2 money source behind oil is money sent from here to Mexico. 15 to 20 BILLION a year.
7479 2018-01-19 22:09:02 Govt = Oil & Gas

7480 2018-01-19 22:09:00 Boycott all products containing palm oil. If it is so harmful to dogs how can it be good for us? There are plenty of alternatives we could use.  #nutella
7481 2018-01-19 22:08:56 Yes and no b/c they have been rewarded for not getting rid of much of their young talent for pennies on the dollar. Only moved Duchene and got mulitple assets in return.

7486 2018-01-19 22:08:02 Other than vegetable oil, oil comes from drilling in the ground.
Bodies are buried.

7490 2018-01-19 22:07:16 Question for #ORFC18 people and others: if we weren't growing rape seed for oil in UK, what other oil crops could we grow? (obviously sunflowers) @ORFC
7491 2018-01-19 22:07:10 You surely don't want that Obama snake oil  in your system

7500 2018-01-19 22:05:44 How many of the population in CHINA don’t have acces to electricity or natural gas or oil. Bet some use wood heat and coal oil lamps
7501 2018-01-19 22:05:43 Secretary of the Interior @RyanZinke recently announced plans to open up nearly every inch of the U.S. coastline to offshore drilling.
It's a nightmare in the making: oil rigs lining the entire coasts, from Maine to Florida and from California to Washington State. #environment
7502 2018-01-19 22:05:42 I had some beef I cooked myself. I don't cook often. Too many herbs and I'm covered in cooking oil.
7503 2018-01-19 22:05:31 Honestly, the rebound the Avs have had is far more impressive to me than the surging Golden Knights. It's remarkable
7504 2018-01-19 22:05:11 With all of the oil wells and the tankers in the Gulf of Mexico exactly how do you plan on protecting Florida beaches? Just another damn politician lying to her constituents!

7507 2018-01-19 22:04:53 Great visuals. Just one clarification as "compensation" could be misinterpreted. SK will be receiving the oil it was supposed to by Sanchi but never did. In financial terms, SK won't be compensated because Sanchi was an FOB shipment, according to Iranian officials.

7513 2018-01-19 22:03:21 Considering where the Oilers and Avalanche were following the 2015-16 season, the argument could be made Sakic has done a better job of reconstructing his lineup than Chiarelli. Again, not a good look.

7517 2018-01-19 22:03:08 it is true. women are SO conditioned to being always ready, always available and now, always prepared to service all but random men. "hookups" I can't imagine women feeling anything but used hence the walk of shame being made into a rape allegation. and we did it to ourselves
7518 2018-01-19 22:03:00 Really good way to cook it is you toss it in nutritional yeast with garlic, cayenne, salt, pepper, onion powder and spray your pan real good and also the top of the tofu with oil. That was my favorite way to cook it when I worked at native sun

7526 2018-01-19 22:02:24 The same height so every verticies has equal loading . I think the main issue is the ammount of traffic and the weather we get in the channel ie half a mile between pillars aint a lot for a 500m long tanker carrying 250,000 barrels of oil in 80mph winds
7527 2018-01-19 22:02:18 I'm really sorry, but since the paintings were made with oil, I always had this reflective light on the boards when I took pictures of them. Even when moving, it would not change anything and the lights were still there. Hence the reason for some lights on my photos.
7528 2018-01-19 22:02:13 Might be because of my clean palate,but the @3floyds /@DarkHorseBrewCo Oil of Gladness Collab is a candidate for best new beer I had in 2018 .Available at the Brass Tap Anniversary party

Solid sleep habits + coffee + CBD oil.
7531 2018-01-19 22:01:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.
7532 2018-01-19 22:01:05 washed my car, vacuumed it out, got new tires and got my oil changed

7568 2018-01-19 21:58:44 I worry about how exposed our economy is to global influences.

God forbid @realDonaldTrump takes an interest in our 2019 presidential elections.

All he'd need to do to stage a 'coup' would be to crash our economy by asking shale producers to lower the price of oil.

7571 2018-01-19 21:58:24 No way. The combination of the Chinese not buying debt and starting to trade oil futures in the yuan means USD is toast. Precious metals will save the value of your resources and you can always gamble on cryptocurrency.
7572 2018-01-19 21:58:19 no really, i'm happy for people who genuinely enjoy nothing worse than mashed dates and coconut oil as their treat, but you know what? there are times in my life when nothing cuts it quite like a jelly snake wrapped round a square of milk chocolate. fuck it.

7576 2018-01-19 21:57:54 Good point, I got trigger happy. My original point from the thread that started last year was that oil has better uses than burning for transportation. EVs don’t require a transmission, use less brakes, so less oil is needed for those. Differential might be an issue after 500k mi

By the time i tried to show it to someone else, the article had disappeared off the internet.

7580 2018-01-19 21:57:27 Right, I'm not the one worried about oil stocks.
7581 2018-01-19 21:57:26 you don't understand I have a collection of brushes good brushes not any mktb jarer brushes:) and its oil so cleaning it is a fkn process.
7582 2018-01-19 21:57:22 Majority of the money,Nigeria makes from oil is embezzled. An ex Nigerian Head of State claimed some stolen money "disappeared mysteriously"
7583 2018-01-19 21:56:59 治るけど時間かかる感じのやつ
7584 2018-01-19 21:56:53 I am so sorry  my brother went through this as well, he was never the same. I truly believe it was the beginning of his downfall with alcohol.  He never got over it either. Prayers of healing for your heart 
7585 2018-01-19 21:56:26 I wish I knew, because gods it is painful and I don't want to have to oil my skin twice a day just to feel comfortable.
7586 2018-01-19 21:56:13 Chairman hope say d joint dope...he korie kpe? Ur head get oil sha
7587 2018-01-19 21:56:13 Where is Ja! What does he think about all this talk about drilling for oil in the US everywhere apart from Florida? 
7588 2018-01-19 21:55:50 Hard to find a reasonable trump supporter/apologist since there is nothing reasonable about trump the snake oil salesman traitor.
7589 2018-01-19 21:55:49 "dog mom" is a big enough red flag
7590 2018-01-19 21:55:39 You have a unique perspective and special calling in life my friend. Your story can be the difference that saves lives. Share, share, share. Through that and peace that is Christ our Lord you can find peace. Thank you for sharing. Go, and be a blessing to others.
7591 2018-01-19 21:55:31 I think oil found after exploration in April. That's why we had all that Syria gasses own people crap. They'd confirmation of oil.
7592 2018-01-19 21:55:31 Extremely nervous cause I’m working and have my client in the car and my car smells like burning oil and I have no idea if I’m going to blow up or die. Pray for me.
7593 2018-01-19 21:55:30 White people not gonna last long. Keep doing these challenges. Bleach challenge next! Then rat poisoning! Get creative. Inject yourselves with olive oil.
7594 2018-01-19 21:55:30 Have you tried coconut oil?
7595 2018-01-19 21:55:26 I had editors once for a piece about the BP spill who kept wanting to call the pre-spill Gulf of Mexico pristine, until I sent them an article about all the spills and oil seeps there
7596 2018-01-19 21:55:25 I’m waiting for them to claim that Obama’s love of windsurfing is somehow a plot to destroy oil companies in favor of green energy.
7597 2018-01-19 21:55:21 My hair products line our bathroom cabinets. Living Proof’s repair oil serum is great on ends. Also Lush dry shampoo works a treat for those who do not want wash often but get dirty roots.
7598 2018-01-19 21:54:53 Ladies. Put down the sodas & drink water. Take care of your real nails under your fake nails. Eat a balanced diet. Stay active. Use coconut oil for an everyday moisturizer for EVERYTHNG. Pee after sex. & lastly.. stop stressing over these niggas & watch how your life flourish
7599 2018-01-19 21:54:41 Have you tried any hydrating oils? Like Rosehip, etc? Incorporating an oil might help.
7600 2018-01-19 21:54:24 Getting an oil change then going back home to hibernate and study!
7601 2018-01-19 21:54:22 I’m about to get an oil change in my car and my heart is racing and my anxiety is through the roof why am I like this

7603 2018-01-19 21:53:58 @MiamiHerald @UnivisionNews @SunSentinel @marcorubio @RepCurbelo 
Forida waters are back in play for oil drilling. Florida GOP better get busy!!
7604 2018-01-19 21:53:49 Tax reform, cutting 16 regulations for every new one, enforcing immigration, lowest unemployment in 17 years, lowest black unemployment in HISTORY, rolling back the job killing EPA, bringing back the coal industry, opened up oil drilling, has our enemies on the ropes, Keep it up
7605 2018-01-19 21:53:47 USA now top 3 in World Oil Production, thanks primarily to North Dakota over the past 10 yrs or so. ND now has fastest-growing Economy in the country. Also, USA now net exporter & no longer relies on imports from nations that are hostile to America. Great news!
7606 2018-01-19 21:53:45 "Change engine oil soon" Stop telling me how to run my life car!.
7607 2018-01-19 21:53:41 Sometimes I encounter non-Southerners who flinch at the mention of sweet tea. They say, “enjoy your sugar water,” and, “instant diabetes!”

But these are often the same people who chug sodas and pound coffee that’s been overloaded with sugar, milk, oil and other flavorings... 
7608 2018-01-19 21:53:32 Peppermint oil in hot chocolate at home   having a wild Friday night here 
7609 2018-01-19 21:53:27 Idiot oil company continues its new trend of incompetence. I have NO OIL. None. No heat. No hot water. This is intolerable.
7610 2018-01-19 21:53:27 but my body makes oil for free
7611 2018-01-19 21:53:20 Yea that's what I was referring to
7612 2018-01-19 21:53:20 just in case there are some baby seals that need to be suffocated with oil drudge and coal dust.  Would hate to let them get away..
7613 2018-01-19 21:53:07 Oh DFW would love this.
7614 2018-01-19 21:52:57 Momma always told me these hoes ain’t for ya that’s why we never mix like water with the oil
7615 2018-01-19 21:52:55 #HarleTsu aka  #HarlequinTsunami is a High #CBD strain. We use an oil from it that is a 1:1 CBD:THC
7616 2018-01-19 21:52:50 People at work and technology are oil and water! Da fuq! 
7617 2018-01-19 21:52:32 Ca(y)lin, you should offer to shine 512's shoes with the oil from your nose if he would let you on WoodScopes.
7618 2018-01-19 21:52:30 The amount of oil

7620 2018-01-19 21:52:16 Or you could just put oil in your hair and make it look greasy
7621 2018-01-19 21:51:46 I've been boycotting Tim Horton's for years, at first because they refused to stop using palm oil when their supplier is cutting down the last rainforest supporting the Bengal Tigers.  Soon there will be none left in the wild.
7622 2018-01-19 21:51:39 I think my diet and coconut oil
7623 2018-01-19 21:51:20 I don’t conversate with anybody with “conservative” and “Christian” in their bio. 
7624 2018-01-19 21:51:17 I think just changing my diet and coconut oil lol
7625 2018-01-19 21:51:02 Because all the holier-than-thou Bible thumpers who backed Trump can't admit they were wrong or duped by Captain Snake Oil.
7626 2018-01-19 21:51:00 Make your own bath scrubs. Use sugar, olive oil, and lavender to create a wonderful exfoliating scrub for rough skin.
7627 2018-01-19 21:50:46 Ye don't forget to coat them with snake oil. I heard it helps.
7628 2018-01-19 21:50:32 I remain curious as to why intelligent people make nonsensical claims “Want to learn how the richest firms on the planet got to be that way?”   Snake oil ...
7629 2018-01-19 21:50:29 Pillar may gett them some help in the pen but not much else.
7630 2018-01-19 21:50:24 In the end what started wwii with japan and usa was not nanjing even though it set the stage. But it was about oil and a power challenge since both didnt see eye to eye.
7631 2018-01-19 21:50:12 Nothing complicated about it, we created a monster because it suited our needs. When he was no longer useful, we illegally invaded his oil rich country causing death & destruction on a massive scale that is ongoing. ISIS is the direct consequence & Blair is a war criminal. Simple
7632 2018-01-19 21:50:08 My boyfriend picked up my car from work to take it to get an oil change and brought me Starbucks 
7633 2018-01-19 21:49:49 I eat lots of fat but it’s mainly in the form of nuts. Occasionally have a cappuccino or cook with a little oil. Also had someone’s leftover steak once. Went out for sashimi twice too. Lol. But mostly vegan.
7634 2018-01-19 21:49:44 I’m so sorry.
7635 2018-01-19 21:49:29 must be! it looks great for a month without practice! Just a question, do you use walnut oil when you're painting?
7636 2018-01-19 21:49:28 Recap: Holding $SGDH, $BYOC, #cattle calls, #gold, #silver, and #oil puts. Long #wheat (plus additional calls), #soyoil. Spread long April #hogs short Aug #hogs. Exited w/ profits long #cattle, #USDCAD....will look to renter at better prices.

7639 2018-01-19 21:49:03 So, your only motivation is profit? Hopefully, you won’t spend it quicker than you earned it like during the last oil price hike. You’ll need the money to host refugees and rebuild infrastructure burnt by extra fires, or flooded, etc.
7640 2018-01-19 21:49:02 I'm not saying I don't cook very often but vegetable oil gets around a bit doesn't it?
7641 2018-01-19 21:49:01 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
7642 2018-01-19 21:48:59 HEAT UP VEGATABLE OIL IN THE PAN. U WILL KNOW ITS HOT ENOUGH IF U SPRINKLE WATER AND THE WATER CRACKS. ONCE IT IS HOT U PUT THEM BAD BOYS IN THE OIL. KEEP TURNING THEM. COOK EM FOR 10 MINS. -WAYNE DEDINA
7643 2018-01-19 21:48:57 I’ve used Dr. Axe and just random essential oil books to come up with my perfect combination for diffusing and the roll-ons I make, but the basis of both is clary sage for hormonal control and peppermint cause it helps practically everything
7644 2018-01-19 21:48:35 I made a banana/avocado with honey n olive oil hair mask deep treatment. Blend blend....covering my hair while I clean the room up. I need to organize my room. It's too stuffed.
7645 2018-01-19 21:48:28 and some men LOVE that excuse don't they.... it's her choice not mine.  BS!!
7646 2018-01-19 21:48:26 There's no more oil. It's running out. Said the Tories in 2014.
7647 2018-01-19 21:48:19 Does oil money give KDB or David Silva talent?
7648 2018-01-19 21:48:18 Part roast in oil

7649 2018-01-19 21:48:14 Hair protectant  wigs are nice quick styles but can do damage if you’re not careful, definitely wig caps a nice hair oil that stimulates growth and something to hold the wig down so it doesn’t slide. Hair her start with gorilla snot until she gets a hang of if, no glue
7650 2018-01-19 21:48:04 This tweet paid for by your neighbourhood oil company
7651 2018-01-19 21:47:58 Lol, you think that's going to justify something for you. I've been around oil many years. Although I have a collage education, what I know you don't learn in school. FYI, I live in CA. Drill baby drill.
7652 2018-01-19 21:47:49 I was pissed when with a stroke of #Trump's pen, ANWR can be open for oil/gas exploration, and he brags about it too, it's bullshit. #VoteBlue2018
7653 2018-01-19 21:47:43 If you call me cold blooded and evil for that? I don’t care. I made the best CHOICE for ME. Not FOR YOU.
7654 2018-01-19 21:47:32 I prefer oil
7655 2018-01-19 21:47:14 The oil field is sounding real nice right now 
7656 2018-01-19 21:47:14 I honestly can't believe y'all had a conversation about hair without me. A lot of it depends on the type although Argan Oil is great all the way around. I highly recommend a comb infused with Argan Oil for frizzy days!
7657 2018-01-19 21:47:07 Just figured it was you. Miss Oil herself. Didn't mean no bad blood aii  same page
7658 2018-01-19 21:47:03 I mean in my opinion as a woman I enjoy the choice I have to either have an abortion, give birth or adopt. It’s not about forcing anybody into abortions it’s about the freedom to CHOOSE.
7659 2018-01-19 21:46:54 These oil change guys just asked me if I wanted kool-aid
7660 2018-01-19 21:46:44 So sorry. Your tale is tragic & heartfelt. Forgive yourself.
7661 2018-01-19 21:46:43 Just ask God, your Father to forgive you .... stating this here is a good way to let others know...
7662 2018-01-19 21:46:42 H Mueller propaganda coming from oil subsidies. Might as well just fold up and call for an inclusive, progressive USA. Oh and did gross things with your bullshit is not a birth right, right? Be better, man.
7663 2018-01-19 21:46:28 Woah putting coconut oil on my eyelashes was a bad idea IM BASICALLY BLIND
7664 2018-01-19 21:45:59 The fact that oil consumption is going up doesn’t mean it’s sensible.
7665 2018-01-19 21:45:50 No more trade with China they’re giving oil to North Korea boycott
7666 2018-01-19 21:45:37 If I didn't fry everything in vegetable oil I'd get no vegetables at all.
7667 2018-01-19 21:45:27 If Arsenal wins tomorrow I'll bath with Palm oil  #kwesehomerun
7668 2018-01-19 21:45:26 Yes I have one homemade popcorn spice mix and a homemade Lawry's No Salt Seasoning mix that I should use. I wonder if a spritz of olive oil would make it stick. Will have to test that out next time. Went back to the stirring popcorn machine after ditching microwave popcorn.
7669 2018-01-19 21:45:18 Dude: *walks in, stares at menu* So what’s in your sauce?
Me: It’s a mixture of red wine vinaigrette and olive oil.
Dude: Oh, is there actually wine in that?
Me: What the fuck kinda question is that
7670 2018-01-19 21:45:11 Let me get to this oil change place I b bullshitin

7674 2018-01-19 21:44:54 Better pick up another jug of peanut oil.
7675 2018-01-19 21:44:43 Coworker 1: They are talking about a 24-pad oil drilling site next to that middle school in our plan's study area

Me: What is it, 1975????

Coworker 2: Isn't this why we have zoning???
7676 2018-01-19 21:44:31 Idk if it’s okay for keto. But the ingredients are: broccoli, rice bran, oil, and sea salt.
7677 2018-01-19 21:44:23 Saudi Arabia made a huge mistake in backing and pushing the anti-fracking movement. Only made U.S. drillers find new cheaper ways to retrieve oil and that OPEC is now pushing cut backs and driving oil higher .... Invest in our drillers!
7678 2018-01-19 21:44:11 I’m in my pajamas because I broke a glade plug in and the oil got all over me and it STINKS
7679 2018-01-19 21:44:06 Well ~99% its a required thing. It’s akin to Rockefeller with oil: if there’s not competition in a market, there is no market. Ultimate downfall to capitalism.
7680 2018-01-19 21:44:00 @JacksonGalaxy can you tell me if the airwick oil warmers r as bad as bad the essential oils?
7681 2018-01-19 21:43:58 Milage, every 3000 or 5000 miles depending upon type of oil and how new your car is. Hope that helps
7682 2018-01-19 21:43:35 The licencing and monetisation of 'programmes' feels like patenting the genome of practice which belongs to all. Sometimes a strong whiff of snake oil and enclosing the commons (3)
7683 2018-01-19 21:43:34 The whole thing. He is absolutely spot on about people generally not seeing themselves as wealthy or poor. As I said in Abdn where wages are skewed by high paying oil jobs.
7684 2018-01-19 21:43:32 I know but we can't complete with the oil companies they got us by the balls
7685 2018-01-19 21:43:23 i trust da dudes that do my oil changes, dey always lookin out
7686 2018-01-19 21:42:54 Lovely, but watch that leaking oil doesn't get into the alternator - just rebuilt a marelli unit for a friend's T-series 420 GSi. Heavily contaminated with PAS fluid after a failed pipe, the brushes disintegrated in service leaving it stranded.
7687 2018-01-19 21:42:52 No problem! I made the switch to oil specifically because my face is oily in the summer and dry in the winter and it’s fine for both.
7688 2018-01-19 21:42:37 “Don’t get confused, sis. I wake up to a head scarf and coconut oil every morning. I’m married to a black QUEEN.” 
7689 2018-01-19 21:42:36 That’s not good for me as allergic to coconut and other nuts! Not sure about the oil will have to check that out! Thanks Hemi.
7690 2018-01-19 21:42:35 Earthquakes in Alberta? Can't recall any serious ones. Is that worth giving up the billions of dollars we take in from oil? Think before speaking, Green Party. Feel free to send me pictures of every members house installed solar panels and electric car.
7691 2018-01-19 21:42:27 Too bad killing Africa's oil and mining industries will cause more problems and poverty for them.
7692 2018-01-19 21:42:25 Thank you for sharing. We need more men to speak up and share their stories.
7693 2018-01-19 21:42:17 I don’t drive much at all so I just be like “It’s been some time since I had a oil change” then yeah I peep how many miles I drove since the last oil change and then do it if I need to lol
7694 2018-01-19 21:42:06 I love getting straight out the shower and putting baby oil gel OR coconut oil on before I’m dried off... My skin feels great.
7695 2018-01-19 21:41:38 this cuomo he is no good making us pay higher taxes and wont let them drill for oil here thats a liberal they call the shots they live and breath for u they own ur life the great  coumo a fine example of hate for his fellow man
7696 2018-01-19 21:41:33 no stock video of oil trains that weren't on fire or derailed?

7703 2018-01-19 21:40:10 Snowden's position plays into the complexity of this political moment. The anti-US imperialist left has to protect the imperialism that is now being decimated by the right through trump. Weird times,  but if you follow the money it makes more sense. ITs all about global oil money

7707 2018-01-19 21:40:03 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.

7709 2018-01-19 21:39:59 Oily fingerprints on watercolor paper are a nightmare. You don't know they're there until you hit them with a dark. Then the oil acts like a resist and taa-daa! Unpaintable smudge! 
7710 2018-01-19 21:39:49 I’ve met so many females that have never got an oil change and get shook when i mention it.. how sway
7711 2018-01-19 21:39:44 Mine is $280, went to talk to someone today and because I was upside down offered me $490 with free oil changes but I think I'm gonna say fuck that.
7712 2018-01-19 21:39:33 oil will always be an extremely important commodity, regardless of how we use it. petrochemical industry is booming while transportation is relying more on alternative sources of energy. so far a barrel of oil costs less than a barrel of apple juice

7824 2018-01-19 21:26:48 I think you're missing the point on oil pricing.  If a monetary authority establishes a gold/oil ratio to be managed (as has appeared to be the case for most of oil's existence), gold will most definitely NOT be irrelevant.

7830 2018-01-19 21:25:58 The fiat is tied to oil. Indeed, it is the prerequisite to installation of banks in their modus operandi. They may want to use other currency, but so long as they’re using oil there is ripe opportunity for infiltration. So step one is to see what you can do about eliminating.
7831 2018-01-19 21:25:49 No, not correct.  Gas is not a storage medium any more than oil or coal.  At some point in the future it may be, but that requires an actual transition to synthetic natural gas, something that isn't even proposed, though I think it would be a great idea.
7832 2018-01-19 21:25:42 CNY oil contract will go a long way on that front if successful.  US can't control CNY oil price if physical flows from Russia, Iran, Angola, & Saudi are all supporting it.  Once that happens, if US wants higher oil, it will HAVE to accept weaker USD v. CNY thru the oil link.

7859 2018-01-19 21:22:46 I'm stating what international law says. And yes, president has the right to call allies if the country is in danger. Russia came only after ISIS occupied more than 70% of Syria and proved effective in fighting ISIS, unlike US who failed to stop them or target their oil convoys.
7860 2018-01-19 21:22:43 i'm aware this is a very That Guy thing to chime in with, but coconut oil is my bff since moving to the desert. slather it on before a shower, wipe it off with a wet washcloth, dab it on dry spots after

7863 2018-01-19 21:22:35 it was all you, it had nothing to do with the fact that I'm garbage, you were holding the small match with its flame almost out and then tripped onto the oil spill that was me,

7865 2018-01-19 21:22:15 Oh dang, so i guess I just needed patience. :P I'm guessing a generous dose of oil/grease probably would help too but I've been trying to stay away from that.
7866 2018-01-19 21:22:15 Very hopeful, REFERENDUM for Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa will be positively resolved. Can't have oil over GOD given life.@RealDonaldTrump.
7867 2018-01-19 21:22:14 Ain’t nothing squeaky to a can of oil. 
7868 2018-01-19 21:22:10 For what? Not knowing about wine?
How do you check the oil in a car then bus Wanker?
7869 2018-01-19 21:21:34 So deep, i found oil.
7870 2018-01-19 21:21:24 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
7871 2018-01-19 21:21:18 @DrEades I just read your article on @tferriss blog - thanks for that! Question: do you have any recommendation when it comes to krill oil and children / toddlers? Age & dosage? My 2 years old son is currently on fish oil (DHA). Thank you.
7872 2018-01-19 21:21:14 Oo I skip washing more often and only comb when wet. Different textures, different methods. But oil is eternal.
7873 2018-01-19 21:21:00 IA. My fave is Trader Joe's Organic Popcorn with Olive Oil or Smartfood's popcorn. They're more flavorful and fluffier than the Skinny Pops, but these do really well in a pinch.
7874 2018-01-19 21:20:58 I use beard oil at night once a week and beard balm during the day 
7875 2018-01-19 21:20:53 do you have oil block? 
7876 2018-01-19 21:20:48 I'm sorry.

7877 2018-01-19 21:20:46 Lots of fun arguing with a couple of anti-vaccination co-workers last night. Wonder what kind of snake oil they’re chugging?

What are you all doing? :)
7881 2018-01-19 21:19:34 finally getting an oil change . judge ya mammy
7882 2018-01-19 21:19:33 Ran out of heating oil for the first time ever.  That cold snap was really something.  Fortunately the truck is on its way!
7883 2018-01-19 21:19:29 This breaks my heart, Sweetie. Sending hugs.
7884 2018-01-19 21:19:20 Damn do everybody need a fuckin oil change today
7885 2018-01-19 21:19:19 Do you put coco butter lotion or oil?
7886 2018-01-19 21:19:18 #TTTT #HeyAmina but this Tetu guy's skin looks like it was brought up in a Christian family and went to an ivy league school. Coconut oil? Castor? Also, where can we find his music??
7887 2018-01-19 21:19:17 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
7888 2018-01-19 21:19:12 I have some coconut oil in the bathroom that I take my makeup off with and it's in a KFC container, so Tracker comes out to the kitchen with it and says "I'm going to throw these rotten potatoes away they've been in the bathroom for a long time. 
7889 2018-01-19 21:19:08 After this sad disaster in #LacMegantic with oil tanks on trains, the Federal, Provincial & Municiple Gov's need to sit down make sure this never happens again. This trial should shake up changes in how #Oil is transported #Safely across Canada. No mater how it's moved. #LPC
7890 2018-01-19 21:18:48 Tune into @questCNN NOW to hear @antoine_halff discuss new surge in US #oil output
7891 2018-01-19 21:18:36 Fraud!!!!! They will mess your car up to get you in a new car . They stripped my oil plug and my engine locked . They refused to fix it.
7892 2018-01-19 21:18:21 and instead remove our forces from them. Here's a simple thing we can do...invest heavily in a ten year plan to get this nation on renewable energy and electric cars in a decade. If we don't need oil and gas, then we don't need to be in the Middle East and most of our security 5/
7893 2018-01-19 21:18:18 Good!!! It's not those poor men's fault that:  

1. Their employers had shitty policies in place that led to the chain of events that caused this disaster.  

2. This country has such asinine policies that we're shipping volatile crude oil by train instead of building pipelines.
7894 2018-01-19 21:17:58 Since it obviously bothers him to this day, I’m thinking no, however I don’t want to answer for you Oil. Thank you for sharing your story.
7895 2018-01-19 21:17:58 US is setting & inflating the oil price, as I said. Control of oil price is what #EnergyDominance is about.  1/ Market price support of the Brent curve using Saudi T-Bills to back massive #BigLong  2/ US oil exports/swing production. China & Russia have nothing to do with it
7896 2018-01-19 21:17:57 Went in for an oil change and the service department tried to upsell me on $140 in extra services. $29.95 for a license plate light replacement? I passed and spent $1.13 on the bulb and less than a minute replacing it.
7897 2018-01-19 21:17:54 That would be great than America would be infinitely energy independent of foreign oil, big corporate interest, with "free power" to directly power the people. With a reversal of #climatechange to boot. #noneedtoargue

7901 2018-01-19 21:17:22 The “manoeuvre” was not condemned in the civilised world, only the Arab world and other parts held hostage to its oil wealth.

7903 2018-01-19 21:17:12 he also peddles snake oil
7904 2018-01-19 21:17:03 If that were true you would have not signed away the protection of our air , soil and water. You would not have sacrificed the future of our children to the oil industry by opening our coasts for drilling nor would you deny #climatechange or choose coal over renewable energy!
7905 2018-01-19 21:16:54 prose the oil wich words are eaten, song the tune of life we speak in
7906 2018-01-19 21:16:53 Oil paint it so they can take down the Mona Lisa and hang that in its place
7907 2018-01-19 21:16:52 I had that it was so sore&painful, I used coconut oil for a while & stopped wearing lashes and eye makeup as often x
7908 2018-01-19 21:16:47 That's it... Today i'm taking Castor oil in a little bit of OJ, for this cold season right now. Wow! now that is the best way to ever take that oil, 3 gulps and it's over... till later  lol ( wished when i was a child we took it that way, 3 spoons by mouth back then was awful)
7909 2018-01-19 21:16:45 Some of yall girls in Odessa are Gold diggers.  Come on would you really be with him without that oil money?
7910 2018-01-19 21:16:44 When they try to tack on extra stuff you don’t need for your car and you only came for an oil change <<<<<<<

7912 2018-01-19 21:16:37 God is holy and just, and goodness has no place among evil, just as oil doesn’t mix with vinegar.

7913 2018-01-19 21:16:29 This lady from country Mark has been dodging me bad about oil money that I’m entitled too. Yes bitch I will hire a lawyer lol
7914 2018-01-19 21:16:28 I'm sorry, Will.
7915 2018-01-19 21:16:11 What happened? Has Spain found oil in Medeterrenean?

7918 2018-01-19 21:15:52 I’ve got a beard oil I’ve been cooking up & more scents for my body butters & shave soaps.
7919 2018-01-19 21:15:44 getting an oil change finally
7920 2018-01-19 21:15:37 my whole room smell like tea tree oil
7921 2018-01-19 21:15:14 Funny that whole two people to make a baby argument
7922 2018-01-19 21:14:22 Well it would become oil and which pays more?
7923 2018-01-19 21:14:20 @RealTimBlack Would love to get @GayleforCA on your show - she goes way back with no selling out. Two-term mayor who beat millions in oil money to give progressives a supermajority in Richmond, CA. Now running for state Lt. Gov.
7924 2018-01-19 21:14:16 continuous rolling war zone, Republican or Democrat admin, we've made no difference there except to get a lot of people killed and even more maimed. The only success of these wars has been to make oil, finance and corporate defense executives wealthier at the expense of our 3/
7925 2018-01-19 21:14:14 is this schedule confirming them playing at lucas oil?
7926 2018-01-19 21:14:07 If CB's had oil on their balance sheets, I'd be on the oil side of the telescope.  Alas, they don't, only all these useless pet shiny rocks :)
7927 2018-01-19 21:13:59 Who got the oil connect
7928 2018-01-19 21:13:57 And a little bit of oil. #NationalPopcornDay
7929 2018-01-19 21:13:56 One of the worst at conning people is Whole Earth. Their peanut butters scream No Sugar No Salt. They pad it out with palm oil. Bad for the planet, bad for our health
7930 2018-01-19 21:13:49 Oh you like bad drinking water mining silt pumped into your streams. Oil spills in the ocean 
.  Yes yhis is the future Trump roll backs has given you for the future
7931 2018-01-19 21:13:43 Want 2get fuel but on the island and driving 2the mainland? Heard 2awolowo road in ikoyi-fort oil selling with minimal queue
7932 2018-01-19 21:13:43 Try putting castor oil on them
7933 2018-01-19 21:13:33 Say oil was still $250 a barrel..Believing a man dat promises 2 end boko haram in 2 months,make $1-N1 in 4 years & hand out 5k monthly to all indigent persons tells u just how daft people cud be.Its nigerians singing @iam_kcee's Limpopo in reverse-'Let us be ur magas tonight'.
7934 2018-01-19 21:13:31 Ok.i will.thAnks. I'm too old ans cynical now I should hope for anyone to stalk me- never mind  no oil painting.thanks for telling me though.not referring to this issue - do you think people can  change,maybe have that "road to Damascus moment" I like to think so

7936 2018-01-19 21:13:20 This attitude not only feeds into absolving men of responsibility because immaculate conception doesn't happen. But it also robs a man of getting a say. You want a man to fund the raising but not get a choice for the child to be born?

If you are stressed come by your local Champaign for some aromatherapy. 
7940 2018-01-19 21:12:58 追いオリーブもいいけど、追いフォローもよろしくな。
7941 2018-01-19 21:12:56 I honestly don’t think it matters much when it comes to something as minor as an oil change. That being said, I always go to Firestone
7942 2018-01-19 21:12:43 Why are you defending a climate change denier? I don't care if they are POTUS, pope, or janitor- there's a huge body of evidence (some of it compiled by big oil even) that climate change is real, that fossil fuels contribute to it, and that it poses a genuine threat.
7943 2018-01-19 21:12:42 This made me laugh he's turned down a fully synthetic club run on oil. United are the biggest club in the world, he would benefit alot more at United then city. It's like turning down a sex doll for the real thing.
7944 2018-01-19 21:12:39 We are clearly at opposite ends of the gold/oil telescope. But then there wouldn't be a market without such differences, would there? 
7945 2018-01-19 21:12:38 Moisturizing tip; Its best to oil your body immediately you get out of the shower and your body is still damp. And also moisturize in a warm room so that your skin can absorb all the goodness of what you are feeding it with.
7946 2018-01-19 21:12:18 So apparently all I have is a coolant leak from a busted hose...no oil or transmission fluid leak like originally suspected. That didn't stop the Ford sales dude from trying to get me to trade it in for a new car though.
7947 2018-01-19 21:12:02 I'm gonna start using Avocado oil on my face now  #iHeartAwards #BestBoyBand #BTS @BTS_twt
7948 2018-01-19 21:11:50 How about some details there, John. DACA? CHIP? Oil Subsidies? Any ideas how to manage this impasse? No? Just more bluster?
7949 2018-01-19 21:11:33 yup
7950 2018-01-19 21:11:32 Thank you for sharing what is obviously still a hard subject for you. May your story stop another young man from the same heartbreak.

For a colicky nature. Eat it solemnly.

● flakes of devil hoof
● 3 caraway seeds
● a tankard of oil of vitriol
● 5 cloud beetles
● resin of toadwine

It will sound like daemons screaming.

Jabbe it with a fork.
7953 2018-01-19 21:11:03 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
7954 2018-01-19 21:10:57 U say ur legs hurt u need a massageeee, turn it over , got some oil I can rub on ur thighs , bust it opennnnn
7955 2018-01-19 21:10:56 So them targeting bottom 6 likely means (to me) that they get AHL quality.
7956 2018-01-19 21:10:39 When you don't change your oil things get real expensive. Just keep up on your car. It's much cheaper that way @ Nimey's The New Generation
7957 2018-01-19 21:10:34 Your #mcm drives a stock 98 civic with 250,000 miles and no muffler that he calls his "drift car". It's not even a VTEC but he doesn't actually know what that means so he redlines it everywhere he goes and doesn't understand why it burns so much oil.

7959 2018-01-19 21:10:28 Scared we might dominate again. City winning is relatively inoffensive to the media despite the oil money
7960 2018-01-19 21:10:24 my ass showed up to work in the hospital today with a thing of CBD oil, my vape and a butterfly knife in my pocket...
7961 2018-01-19 21:10:22 Brought my car in for an oil change and found out my drivers side turn signal is burnt, my passenger side headlight is burnt and BOTH my plate lights are burnt  #whoops #femaledriver #whatsaplatelight
7962 2018-01-19 21:10:21 Strome is bottom 6. They all figured he could at least play top 6.

7972 2018-01-19 21:09:21 Yeah I use a tea tree oil face wash I’ll use my other mask tonight bc I did my clay one a few nights ago tonight I’ll do the anti-pollution one
7973 2018-01-19 21:09:20 Got this Jasmine Absolute oil and when I diffuse it it smells like dead jasmine flowers in sludge. Why?
7974 2018-01-19 21:09:19 When the stylist put oil in between the braids and massage them 
7975 2018-01-19 21:09:19 One of the biggest oil terminals in the world at Rotterdam I’m sure the Dutch will have something to say about restricting access to that
7976 2018-01-19 21:09:16 They are just repeating team logic...which is flawed. Replace a top 6 w/ younger bottom 6. No get the best asset(s). I truly think they’ll do far better than Strome.
7977 2018-01-19 21:09:07 Congress wants to arm Ukraine. Trump's position is "the US government is not selling the Ukrainian government weapons" according to Heather Nauert. They just approved a licenses to buy from US cos.
The oil is fairly obvious, a warmer planet dependent of carbon helps Russia.
7978 2018-01-19 21:09:06 Convenience can come with a price...I'll be smelling like a human cigarette when i leave this oil change. 
7979 2018-01-19 21:09:00 they're like small heads of lettuce. i had them grilled with olive oil and some special sauce with fig in it, they tasted like little salads
7980 2018-01-19 21:08:50 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
7981 2018-01-19 21:08:30 Christopher Wray who was a partner at law firm King & Spalding that represents Rosneft , Russia's national oil company. CEO is Igor Ivanovich a close ally and oligarch butt buddy of Vlad the Impaler Putin. That Christopher Wray ????????
7982 2018-01-19 21:08:29 There is a reason gold sits on CB balance sheets & oil doesn't.  Oil & gold never flow in the same direction.  US may want to be on new "oil standard", but this requires massive oil inflation, which China (& Russia) don't want, & it appears they're driving the boat, not the US.
7983 2018-01-19 21:08:28 Chia likes Nurse enough that he scoffed at trading him for Hamilton. Combined with the fact he leads the Oil D in points etc., tells me he’s getting paid regardless he plays PP or not. Therefore, let him continue developing this season.

7985 2018-01-19 21:08:05 A collision inv a car colliding with the central reservation barrier has closed J19. Traffic diverted via the exit and entry slips at location.  Oil spillage to deal with.

7988 2018-01-19 21:07:32 Yeah you’re need need to fix some of those things lmao. But those environmental factors, I suggest buying sheet masks or clay masks to soothe the irritation/inflammation of the skin! Things like cucumber, tea tree oil, green tea, kelp, etc are great for that!
7989 2018-01-19 21:07:27 Great car, main issue I had with mine was the oil leak they are notorious for where the head joins the block, poor seal on the gasket but yours might be new enough not to have that problem.
7990 2018-01-19 21:07:25 Shout out to Nathan for taking my car to get the oil changed and washing it while I was working 

Just realized he ain't got the Twitter or he blocked me...both very possible...
7991 2018-01-19 21:07:21 Nobody cares about the wages. Or total amount spent. I do however care about the way the media portray the transfer just because he's coming to United. All of a sudden oil rich city are football's moral compass. Have a laugh 
7992 2018-01-19 21:07:19 Just salt rosmarin and extra olive oil. Italian way.
7993 2018-01-19 21:07:17 OIL DIFF: 5.33 -> 5.33
7994 2018-01-19 21:07:06 Look into natural treatments like cannabis oil
7995 2018-01-19 21:07:00 A whole set of oil he want but he ain’t listening to me smh
7996 2018-01-19 21:06:57 Ok you know what ima say it. The coconut oil hype ain’t shit. It make me dry af
7997 2018-01-19 21:06:42 Many in the local media have hinted at the notion in various radio hits that targeting a younger player to fit into the bottom six should be the mindset My question is, wasn't that what Strome was supposed to be?
7998 2018-01-19 21:06:41 Damn right Florida needs to remain vigilant! All IQ-45 sees is inve$tment in oil, and couldn't care LESS about oil spills on either coast of FL. It's bad enough we already have black holes reducing fish/fishing in the Gulf along the west coast. #ScrewTrumpAndGutlessDeptOfInferior
7999 2018-01-19 21:06:23 Yeah, me too! But, even the healthy fats gets to my stomach like avocado and olive oil.  I guess we both just have sensitive stomachs, but of course my mine is way more sensitive than yours lol. 
8000 2018-01-19 21:06:10 They don't even cover the same sorts of scales.  While electric cars do tend to use lithium ion batteries, this ultimately is small scale compared to what oil is doing right now.  Tech like molten salt is being looked into for those sorts of things and in the works.
8001 2018-01-19 21:06:07 I'd say gold can't rise unless oil rises & dollar falls (since now on #OilStandard. Oil curve has been inflated/financialised/monetised by 700,000 contract increase in Brent/WTI Managed Money open interest down the curve. Mainly sold by shale producers hedging production forward
8002 2018-01-19 21:06:04 Instead of baby oil, try extra virgin olive oil. The palmer's stretch mark oil is good too.
8003 2018-01-19 21:05:57 When sick, if you see a doctor instead of going to church to be anointed with oil & prayed for,  than u my friend are an #atheist James 5:14
8004 2018-01-19 21:05:52 Who made the decision to expand the public service in the 2000’s when oil went past 140 bucks a barrel? It wasn’t union leadership. It was actually the same crowd who brought us Muskrat Falls. Our rainy day oil legacy fund?
There it was. GONE
8005 2018-01-19 21:05:24 Huge oil spill off the Chinese coast :(

8009 2018-01-19 21:04:45 Honda gona ask me do i want a free car wash today with my maintenance. You damn right scamming me 130 for an oil change
8010 2018-01-19 21:04:40 Toasted sesame oil is amazing. Such a small amount adds so much flavour. Good choice!
8011 2018-01-19 21:04:28 Laughable all the sudden worried about adequate military funding.
Obvious you care more about illegal aliens than the country
8012 2018-01-19 21:04:02 Question: Are oil trains running through Lac Megantic once again? There seems to be a virtual media blackout on this topic.
8013 2018-01-19 21:03:53 He’s the only one I’ve seen.
8014 2018-01-19 21:03:48 Ah, but it's where it's positioned in respect to transporting oil to you know where...
8015 2018-01-19 21:03:41 Think is was faulty! Now tho it could be due oil leaking onto clutch
8016 2018-01-19 21:03:39 The 11 or 12 picks up to that point we’re clock work, Oilers ether had Barzal at 16 or everyone in the scouting department should be fired! A RHC That was projected top ten falls & the Oil trade for another LHD...brutal
8017 2018-01-19 21:03:37 you got it:)
8018 2018-01-19 21:03:33 With VGK possibly keeping Neal; there are very few true rentals at F other than Kane. Maroon cheaper and far less maintenance. I’d ask for it and I think they just might get it.
8019 2018-01-19 21:03:22 @DurlsJr deserves this. Heart of a lion, passion for the Oil like no other
8020 2018-01-19 21:03:21 burn that book in oil and fire
8021 2018-01-19 21:03:20 I would agree on the 3rd but depending on demand a 2nd may also be doable.
8022 2018-01-19 21:03:12 Halloumi fried in paprika, garlic and olive oil has to be the tastiest thing on this planet. Oh wow
8023 2018-01-19 21:03:08 
8024 2018-01-19 21:02:58 Well the choice should be made before conceiving. 42% of unintended pregnancies end in abortion. You’d expect Anti-abortionists to be pro-contraception but they aren’t. That’s my my main issue with many pro-lifers.
8025 2018-01-19 21:02:58 Do some research in to Black seed oil. Good luck with everything.
8026 2018-01-19 21:02:52 This is heartbreaking, I’m so sorry Will. 
8027 2018-01-19 21:02:48 Ready oil pump hnd blade..
8028 2018-01-19 21:02:48 I don't know what happened to my almond shampoo and almond oil either. I definitely need that for this cold ass weather. 
8029 2018-01-19 21:02:38 @RogerMcKnight "goodness gracious" those darn tax levies. What about those darn refiners that r ripping us off & not even using any lube. #Canadian citizens should be rebelling. #Gasoline prices now equal to when oil was $120/ barrel but oil only $67 barrel. #GasolineRebellion
8030 2018-01-19 21:02:28 Best place to get an oil change other than your car’s dealership?

8033 2018-01-19 21:02:23 murdering their progeny and somehow convincing them you have done them a favor. there is not much more evil than that. some of the worst, genocidal, racist, cold blooded, calculating evil. and the woman thinks that by being  constantly available to service a man she is liberated
8034 2018-01-19 21:02:11 Maybe time to use safe pipelines to move oil products in North America vs tankers and trains ? @codyincalgary
8035 2018-01-19 21:02:01 He did have my favorite quote re LA sen candidate Woody Jenkins: “he was born a quart low and has been burning oil ever since.”
8036 2018-01-19 21:01:53 Many thanks. I got some leaves from a neighbour. This time I just blanched it and then slow cooked it in olive oil. I found it a more satisfying taste than spinach or silver beet. Next time I'll try ribollita.
8037 2018-01-19 21:01:39 It's not just him...
8038 2018-01-19 21:01:33 Nothing is as soothing as the smell of oil paint
8039 2018-01-19 21:01:32 I think City are guna buy a superstar in the summer. Dont know who but got a feeling they guna drop a big dollop of Arab cash in a oil drum on someones boardroom table & there's guna be silence in amazement. 

#Manchester #City
8040 2018-01-19 21:01:23 Okay, new battery, new alternator, new transmission, new belts, and new oil! LET'S RIDE!!!! 
8041 2018-01-19 21:01:22 I love this idea. I feel curry powder, turmeric and oil can make it orange but that would taste not so good.
8042 2018-01-19 21:01:13 And ur arabian paymasters,uzed to sell DATE PALMS on the streets of BOMBAY (at that time) ,when their yankee paymasters hadn't discovered OIL over there. One nuke in their oil refineries & ur entire #Ummah will again b selling date palms on d roadside.
8043 2018-01-19 21:01:09 Most people with common sense would say the government in CA allowing illegal aliens to commit crimes onto citizens is not protecting human health & welfare.  But you say companies providing oil so your organic gluten free almond milk can be delivered to whole Foods is reckless.
8044 2018-01-19 21:01:05 Hmm pizza is pretty tasty oil then!
8045 2018-01-19 21:01:02 I agree, also tho I did really like the news today that the US is predicted to out produce saudis arabia in oil in 2018, we need to keep producing more and more oil and to also build more refineries until we are self sufficient for #NationalSecurity an also #CHIPfunding no sscuts
8046 2018-01-19 21:01:00 
8047 2018-01-19 21:00:56 we had a 1500G tank for canola oil when dad had the feed mill for the pigs. Oil in every recipe
8048 2018-01-19 21:00:49 GenX is already big on data. It is their O2. We would surely need charging points which would take time. (building Infra) plus acceptance of people to move to EV vehicle from oil engines ones. These are going to be 2time consuming factors before oil to pave way for electric.
8049 2018-01-19 21:00:34 Rosehip triple c+e oil #EminenceWinter
8050 2018-01-19 21:00:27 What kind of oil is your popcorn popped in?
8051 2018-01-19 21:00:15 Syria does not have that much oil, it was like 0,5% of GDP in 2010 before the civil war. However in any event, these are the sorts of people who SHOULD be supported, just like Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress in apartheid South Africa.
8052 2018-01-19 21:00:14 Methane spikes have been linked to the oil industry
8053 2018-01-19 21:00:14 They’ll get a 3rd for him.  Also offer him 3x3.5 and when he says no get the best draft pick you can between now and trade deadline
8054 2018-01-19 21:00:08 Oil change before getting the boy, because I have the boy all day tomorrow and have to take him to a ski lesson.
8055 2018-01-19 21:00:05 YES. All the oil. Wash & condition your hair every other day. Braid it when you sleep. Brush it a ton. Go easy on products/dye. Be careful not to sit on it (my current problem)
8056 2018-01-19 21:00:00 Faith doesn't come by praying and fasting or by drinking anointing oil. It comes by hearing the Word of God.
8057 2018-01-19 20:59:43 Almost stopping and getting oil 20 mins
8058 2018-01-19 20:59:42 Anti united agenda as always. Media and opposition are scared because Jose has revived us and we are a threat again. Sanchez is joining the biggest club in the world. Not an oil club
8059 2018-01-19 20:59:28 my cause of death with definitely be essential oil/candle-fire related
8060 2018-01-19 20:59:23 This morning I spilt a bunch of tea tree oil in my room and the smell was so strong it made me feel ill but I've just gone in there again and now my room smells so nice
8061 2018-01-19 20:59:16 He's not getting them a 1st on his own but there is no problem with aiming for the moon ;)
8062 2018-01-19 20:59:15 why not because pizza doesn't taste like the oil
8063 2018-01-19 20:59:15 lol ! first things first .. go to your closest beauty supply store (because I know you live in the ‘Stead .. I’m reccommending you go to the one by Payless thats across from Nagasaki that got shut down) get Tend Skin (its in a blue bottle) .. its a really good Vitamin E oil
8064 2018-01-19 20:59:10 Olive oil,shit, who needs the pizza?
8065 2018-01-19 20:59:10 Diversity in color and gender does not mean diversity
8066 2018-01-19 20:59:03 Went to get my oil changed and they did an inspection and said I have to replace a part of my axle and it’ll cost upwards of $500 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha pocket change am I right ladies
8067 2018-01-19 20:58:56 yes.  USD/oil correlation broke down then too.  And CNY/JPY.
8068 2018-01-19 20:58:47 Sure....like sign it over to your buddy Vladimir and try to scuttle the free press. Did I leave out 9 million kids off insurance, or drill oil wells in federal parks. You are just awesome...except for the incessant lying.
8069 2018-01-19 20:58:41 I agree, battered & crispy fish in the tacos is delish. Couldn’t quite be bothered to do batter & oil, but the baked fish was tasty - especially with the smoked paprika!!
8070 2018-01-19 20:58:36 Don’t eat cereal. It’s minging. Though I have been known to make my own muesli. No packet involved and no sugar or oil either.
8071 2018-01-19 20:58:34 Only if u fix the px of gold.  Allow px of gold to float ( Keynes' bancor) & such problems go away.  China did this; Gold/Oil ratio was reset higher in '14; all nations can decide oil's px based on their needs via how they value gold, instead of the US deciding for all thru USD
8072 2018-01-19 20:58:33 The idea started in Matty’s head...
8073 2018-01-19 20:58:14 I bet 5 red m&m's it was 1 or less.
8074 2018-01-19 20:58:10 Super glad my dad taught me some things about tires and oil changes. Lmao listen to ya dads
8075 2018-01-19 20:58:09 Yup. I mean I’ll avoid them if they’re obviously battered, but if it’s just sharing the same oil, well sometimes I’ll take that chance.
8076 2018-01-19 20:57:57 its a typo. its actually worm oil
8077 2018-01-19 20:57:57 Based on his price, I think he could possibly fetch a 1st. Likely better than any available young player.
8078 2018-01-19 20:57:51 And they should’ve been doing that for the last 6 weeks, I agree. But just because one guy gets hurt doesn’t mean you put up a for sale sign
8079 2018-01-19 20:57:51 Will, horrifying....I’m so sorry...
8080 2018-01-19 20:57:48 The pain in my feet is from holding personsalive who breathe other than oxygen which when meeting oxygen in the body gives off a burning sensation like oil & water doesnt mix
8081 2018-01-19 20:57:35 神秘的
8082 2018-01-19 20:57:33 No! I have cooked them with Nigella’s Life Transforming Cold Oil Method.
8083 2018-01-19 20:57:29 Not sure where you stand on marijuana but CBD oil is all natural no THC(so no actual high) you don’t need a medical card for it and it’s just a fantastic pain reliever. I take it for anxiety cramps and headaches. But you can get in liquid,pill, and even coffee forms
8084 2018-01-19 20:57:26 He reverse image searche…. Coconut oil trash for that.
8085 2018-01-19 20:57:25 @RogerMcKnight you like to talk about taxes being very high when it comes to gasoline prices but you never talk about the refinery margins and just how much they are making off Canadian citizens. Gas prices the same now as when oil was $120 per barrel in 2004 but oil is only $67
8086 2018-01-19 20:57:07 ELI5 why the temperature of the oil matters.
8087 2018-01-19 20:57:05 Putting illegal aliens before Americans and holding country hostage is no way to govern.
8088 2018-01-19 20:57:03 So I was at the hair cutting place the other day, and they were like 'Do you wanna try the 'skull' beard oil?'

Sure, yeah, why not.
8089 2018-01-19 20:56:58 I've seen that before, I don't think it was an agreement, I think it was a threat.

I think we was told "conform to our plan and take in thousands of immigrants, or we'll cut your oil off".
8090 2018-01-19 20:56:44 お腹空いて眠気が来ないステキ
8091 2018-01-19 20:56:22 I'm curious when this idea of Maroon landing Oilers a useful young NHLer started. Acquire as high a draft pick as possible, it's the best of both worlds. They either use it to add young skill at the draft or as a viable trade chip to get help in the summer. Seems rather obvious.
8092 2018-01-19 20:56:17 It CA is getting cheaper to abort that to Registery a nice car??  How is that right
8093 2018-01-19 20:56:09 Concur.  He can appear to be all sanctimonious about the value of life, but it’s clear what he really values.  2020 and he goes home to Sea Island where he can look at oil platforms off the coast. @PamParker7
8094 2018-01-19 20:55:50 I think I'll just let the woman decide.
8095 2018-01-19 20:55:35 Weirdest thing, coming home today, I saw a group of 8 or more black cats all sitting in an abandoned lot surrounding one fluffy white cat. I want an oil painting of it.
8096 2018-01-19 20:55:21 Oil is literally destroying the planet
8097 2018-01-19 20:55:19 Really!! It is strange how many parts are true!  Moses was put in a basket covered with tar.  So an oil man checked it out! WALLA OIL was discovered!

8101 2018-01-19 20:54:36 The great @GrimKim taught me the heavy metal hair secret: argan oil, argan oil, and more argan oil
8102 2018-01-19 20:54:27 And when you think about it.. Most problems in this world stem from oil.
8103 2018-01-19 20:54:04 Lol! Glad she is better. Had pneumonia once and it was rotten.  I understand that a good dose of cod liver oil does wonders, but the butt problem may be chronic, a sort of "dollies shingles." Of course, pretend tea and toast is a known doll remedy, but may be a placebo.
8104 2018-01-19 20:53:56  oh?? the anger from your palm oil and onions gari Ada. I have all the anger in the world, try meeee!
8105 2018-01-19 20:53:52 Oil that taste like Pizza.  Sure
8106 2018-01-19 20:53:36 Pete Lougheed was acutely aware that technology was fast making advances to extract the oil,not tar! So cut  Eastern welfare crap! Saudi Oil

8109 2018-01-19 20:53:27 Oh and don't scrub.  That's how u get the burns..I know from experience....but you will LOVE the results. Use as directed.  And apply some coconut oil to soothe afterwards.
8110 2018-01-19 20:53:22 Or he actually wants to join worlds biggest club witj a history rather than a club with no history built on oil money ?
8111 2018-01-19 20:53:20 Just wait, they will eventually go after the company that owned the drilling rigs, for drilling the wells producing this oil.
8112 2018-01-19 20:53:18 She bought bitter kola,tom tom,mint and mixed it in water, palm oil and sugar too I m the one coughing but she bears the pain Iya ni wura

8114 2018-01-19 20:52:52 Yes indeed - there was a large camp that thought they wouldnt be ramping up witht he Canadian v US oil spread
8115 2018-01-19 20:52:49 El precio del gas oil en Noviembre del año 2015 $ 12.72 x litro, el precio del gas oil en Enero 2018 $  20.85 x litro, un incremento del 64% . Se espera un aumento del 6% . #ElMejorEquipoDeLos50Años @BASUALDOGUS @martalapiru @Seba_hz @JuanciMartinez1 @
8116 2018-01-19 20:52:47 Tea tree oil is nice and soothing too and I'm currently using an olive oil based body wash that's working ok. When I get flare up, it usually means, I've been spending too long under too hot water as well.
8117 2018-01-19 20:52:45 I’m so sorry!
8118 2018-01-19 20:52:35 raff always lookin like an oil painting. Lovely
8119 2018-01-19 20:52:16 @VeggieGrill Thank you for bringing delicious cruelty-free food to the masses! Please consider eliminating canola oil from your ingredients. It has been shown to be damaging to the brain and it is not healthy. Thank you!

8121 2018-01-19 20:52:12 It's okay, I'm sure the British spilling 5 millions barrels of crude oil off the coast of America more that makes up for it
8122 2018-01-19 20:52:00 Why are we being considered “too comfortable” because we are trying to shine some kind of positivity where y’all have done nothing but dump negativity with no actual actions?

We know the situation isn’t ideal, but we also know that throwing oil on a fire won’t put it out.
8123 2018-01-19 20:51:55 Julia watched him for a few seconds. Before putting some oil on her hands

8125 2018-01-19 20:51:34 I just got done cooking eggs and chicken in olive oil, and I look over at @deblakester and he was eating the charred bits from the frying pan. I'm ready to move out.

8131 2018-01-19 20:50:33 Depends. The notion that teams automatically get more at the deadline as opposed to a few weeks sooner isn't necessarily true. If a team wants a guy & Maroon will be a target for a few, moving him sooner may work in the Oilers benefit. At this stage, they need to recoup assets.
8132 2018-01-19 20:50:30 why medical cbd oil twice as expensive as street weed
8133 2018-01-19 20:50:29 Young Saudi ruler is taking careful steps. He needs to be given time to test the waters as the hardline clergy has a lot of sway about every aspects of citizens. He has to weigh in 5000 drone princes, 60%youth unemployment and falling oil revenue. Jeez!!!
8134 2018-01-19 20:50:26 CBC News Net is talking about transporting oil by train...and is showing a VIA rail passenger train.
8135 2018-01-19 20:50:22 Oh!  I see you don't like it that I said pay for your own people with the billions and billions your oil rich countries have!
8136 2018-01-19 20:50:12 PUT SOME COCONUT OIL IN UR HAIR, SOME LEMON IN UR WATER, AND HANDLE UR BUSINESS

8138 2018-01-19 20:49:53 I'm sorry. Pray.
8139 2018-01-19 20:49:25 The US exports oil to Canada and Venezuela to mix with their heavier oil. A decline could slowly/slightly impact specific grades of oil currently exported or perhaps the ports used.
8140 2018-01-19 20:49:18 I'm out of heating oil..... during snow and arctic wind front..... nice.
8141 2018-01-19 20:49:13 In order to get USD an oil company  needs to extract and sell oil (real wealth). All that US gov needs todo is push a button on a computer

8145 2018-01-19 20:48:31 Tone can't come to the phone right now...... Why?... Cuz he's in the other room mourning the loss of our olive oil. My mom knocked it over. He's very sad.
8146 2018-01-19 20:48:28 Why does your country import petrol from white people when it sits on oil? Was there a brain drain with the trans Atlantic slave trade?
8147 2018-01-19 20:48:09 Well of course. Wouldn't want to be doing the right thing by the people of an oil rich country would they?
8148 2018-01-19 20:48:04 He talked to the oil executives and they said it was ok
8149 2018-01-19 20:47:59 My car already ride better with this oil change
8150 2018-01-19 20:47:36 A collision inv a car colliding with the central reservation barrier has closed the #M60 c/w within J19. Traffic diverted via the exit and entry slips at location.  Oil spillage to deal with. @NWmwaypolice and @HighwaysNWEST #trafficofficers on scene. @manchesterfire en route.

8153 2018-01-19 20:47:16 Alaskans own 176,562 shares of SEVEN GENERATIONS ENERGY LTD, worth $3,217,078. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.
8154 2018-01-19 20:47:10 Agree...and I would think that vacationing on the yacht of an oil billionaire while an MP and leader of a party much worse than Trudeau visiting a spiritual leader and philanthropist.
8155 2018-01-19 20:46:59 Cynthia is correct.  We have seen 2 of the 5 largest oil companies on the planet flooded out of the headquarters.  BP HQ is still recovering.  Other companies see this and the 4th largest city can't even crack the top 20 list for consideration.  Houston's leaders are failing.
8156 2018-01-19 20:46:49 What’s the rush?   It’s like everyone wants to say “blow it up” just to be cool, but what good does it do now vs 3 weeks from now

8160 2018-01-19 20:46:27 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
8161 2018-01-19 20:46:08 3 spoonfuls of coconut oil are delicious and helps me get calories after a long run. Same as pizza and beer. Aaaaand?
8162 2018-01-19 20:46:02 Just as they can buy USD, the oil company could sell USD too. Everyone holds the currency they prefer (and where their debts are denominated).
8163 2018-01-19 20:46:00 for healthy looking hair, peel, slice and boil an apple until its soft,then put it in a blender with any type of oil you like. then when its creamy put it on the ends of your hair ( avoid the roots ) and leave it on for an hour or two ! and you’re welcome
8164 2018-01-19 20:45:41 These folks better wash my car after I get my oil changed
8165 2018-01-19 20:45:39 That is a factor in those numbers yes. I'd suggest this year Maroon has made everyone better that he's played with, including RNH, while Lucic has not. He and RNH have been oil and water.
8166 2018-01-19 20:45:25 @Gidi_Traffic FLASH: Five oil workers of Sahara Energy Oil Company have been kidnapped by suspected militants at the Ajoki community, which borders Edo and Delta States, .
8167 2018-01-19 20:45:23 Ryan Nugent-Hopkins is out for 6 weeks. Perhaps that's not so bad? It's still possible for the #Oil to get to 3rd overall, so play the kids & sell what you can. They're only 4 points out. #TradeDeadline #RNH #Oilers #ByeByeLetestu #ItWasFunWhileitLastedPatrick
8168 2018-01-19 20:45:19 It's not like a conventional oil change.  My understanding is it is only changed once/yr or less. Not 100% sure (not an owner) but I think it only happens at annual maintenance which isn't even required.
8169 2018-01-19 20:45:16 There is a good alberta labor market summary that breaks down the adds.  Largest were trades (7.5k) education (5k) and accomodation (5.4).  We do have to differentiate improvements due to external (no govt control ie oil price) or internal factors (directly due to govt polity).
8170 2018-01-19 20:45:13 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

8173 2018-01-19 20:44:58 BOOM!
Reuters just reported that Russian tankers have supplied fuel to North Korea at least 3 separate times in recent months by transferring cargoes at sea.
realDonaldTrump Trump Just attacked China for transporting oil to North Korea.

I wonder why he won't attack Russia!
8174 2018-01-19 20:44:55 Naaaah. Lets just leave all of Our Oil where it is and stay involved in the Middle East. That has been working out SOOOOOOOO well. Whatever.
8175 2018-01-19 20:44:39 have u tried castor oil
8176 2018-01-19 20:44:34 I usually go crush, salt, pepper, olive oil, spread on the toast, egg.
8177 2018-01-19 20:44:32 Yeah they can buy oil but first they need to buy USDs. Not only does that drive USD value up but also lets the US lock them out of oil trade
8178 2018-01-19 20:44:26 Wow Ineed a inspection && oil change
8179 2018-01-19 20:44:21 You can call him a 3C if you like but he's the leading goal scorer on a team that cannot consistently produce offence. The time for playing for now passed long ago.
8180 2018-01-19 20:44:19 But is it thicker than an oil pitch?
8181 2018-01-19 20:44:16 If you have oregano oil, take that. It's suppose to repress food poisoning

8188 2018-01-19 20:43:53 My girlfriends son worked at the Nigerian oil works. On his first week there the boss was giving him a lift to work and a group of males killed a guy in broad daylight at the traffic lights stole his shoes and clothes and ran off...his boss said "You see this all the time here."

8209 2018-01-19 20:42:05 also fuck foreign cars, a simple oil change just cost me $100
8210 2018-01-19 20:42:00 In every generation there will be those selling snake oil. One of these salesman today is the Media.
8211 2018-01-19 20:41:56 I was legit just talking to my mom on getting a oil change
8212 2018-01-19 20:41:52 1) Canada is the largest supplier of foreign oil to the US. More than Saudi Arabia. 2) Canada buys more US products than any country in the world.
8213 2018-01-19 20:41:32 Even oil is not going away so soon.
8214 2018-01-19 20:41:29 The loss of a child is always tortuous and unbearable.  It's also rarely spoken about by men.  God Bless you for sharing your story.

You, your child and his or her mother will be in my prayers.
8215 2018-01-19 20:41:28 Do you honestly believe that’s what will happen? Unions didn’t bugger up NL’s economy. Our politicians and reliance on oil did the job on us.
8216 2018-01-19 20:41:21 How about wearing loads of mfc swag, lots of smaller counts to remove them an item at a time. Then candle wax as Pool suggested or how about glitter oil. (did you find something the UV lamp will work in) UV paint show? xxx831xxx
8217 2018-01-19 20:41:16 i don't eat dairy so coconut oil can add a fatty, buttery taste to dishes if you add it in instead of ghee. not perfect but i've heard dalda is very bad for health
8218 2018-01-19 20:40:55 But you could never use them in places like Venezuela, where (despite being an oil exporter), there are constant brownouts and electricity shortages
8219 2018-01-19 20:40:43 Thnx for sharing. Prayers to you.
8220 2018-01-19 20:40:33 Speaking of did you ever decide to give the oil a go? I switched to capsules of it a few weeks back from same company as I didn’t enjoy having pop first thing in the morning to wash the taste
8221 2018-01-19 20:40:22 Room clean, essential oil diffuser going, about to get some work done.
8222 2018-01-19 20:40:13 Yup but they only have so many tradeable pieces.
8223 2018-01-19 20:40:12 Thanks for sharing this. Yours is an important story that can help make the situation more real to others and it can help inform people's decisions to take a pro-life stance.

8226 2018-01-19 20:39:55 canola for ordinary cooking, coconut oil as well for certain things
8227 2018-01-19 20:39:54 People in Europe dip bread in olive oil all the time. So, no it doesn’t put me off in the slightest.
8228 2018-01-19 20:39:53 IL can have it!  Denver's cost of living, traffic & housing situation, and general infrastructure are horrible just since the oil & gas and "green" booms; we can't handle another boom quite yet.
8229 2018-01-19 20:39:46 Nontradable is looking really problematic.... and how does 1.5% neutral reconcile with their pledged 3.4% potential growth and twin deficit is beyond me. Ps I wish all bank analysts realise exports of oil= price * volume
8230 2018-01-19 20:39:41 Yes coconut oil and rose water!
8231 2018-01-19 20:39:33 African Pride Growth Oil and MPL....I'll definitely give it a try, thank you.
8232 2018-01-19 20:39:24 Of course we did.... our club was winning things before yours formed.. perhaps under a different name but don’t kid yourself that we didn’t exist before the oil money.. you sound like the Dippers
8233 2018-01-19 20:39:14 Throw in the towel now because a 3C is out? They should be playing for now and simultaneously looking for sell off.Won’t get much for Maroon
8234 2018-01-19 20:39:12 That's not true.  1971 came from gold, 1933 came from gold.  1893 as well i believe.  Numerous financial mkt charts show something changed right around that speech, I agree.  However, China/Russia gold window open means oil cannot rise unless gold rises (i.e. unless USD falls)...
8235 2018-01-19 20:39:06 Got an oil change on the car today. With most of the major auto manufacturers announcing moves toward EVs, how long can companies like Jiffy Lube survive?
8236 2018-01-19 20:39:03 It’s so great. It has absolutely saved my face. I started with Vaseline and that just sucked. Coconut oil has been perfect.
8237 2018-01-19 20:38:57 You know well that I'm far better in tech than trading. I can tell what's working or not. Still the coin rates have nothing to do with the tech. Lot of snake oil. That saddens me much. I invest in my personnal knowledge.

8243 2018-01-19 20:38:28 i bought activated charcoal to whiten my teeth for prom and coconut oil to revive my hair for prom
8244 2018-01-19 20:38:22 It is anticipated to have 167 trillion ft3 of gas up from an estimated 11 trillion ft3 of gas in 2011 and it is also ranked sixth in the world for shale oil. The EIA report was only able to evaluate the Maracaibo basin in western Venezuela and shale potential in the eastern

8248 2018-01-19 20:37:38 @TeamCavuto The Iranian Tanker carrying oil that exploded in the China Sea doesn't look like it was sea worthy! The hull looks disintegrated! Think this was on purpose! @FoxNews
8249 2018-01-19 20:37:27 Really? "We" influence the price of oil? Or, in this instance, Tar. Remind me to ask a Saudi Prince for a bank loan. Diversify your economy and stop whining about how the rest of Canada is stopping you.

8263 2018-01-19 20:36:15 are you seriously asking how it empowers women? By giving them a choice?
8264 2018-01-19 20:36:11 Could oil it
8265 2018-01-19 20:36:00 Resets of gold/oil always comes from oil. Never gold. Since 1st July 2017 in my analysis US #EnergyDominance strategy has changed the market paradigm after over 15 years
8266 2018-01-19 20:35:58 @BillGates are you aware Nigeria is the most corrupt African nation? Are you aware Nigeria is has lots if oil whose revenues have been squandered by the same leaders you are helping to by paying a debt they have created. Nigeria is a very rich country. Disappointed. I'm african.

8273 2018-01-19 20:35:33 I just received my hydro bill 936$!!! while freezing in my house in Courtenay. Encourage clean electrical power instead of using fossil fuel.  Smoke in  comox valley is terrible from wood and oil furnaces. Are you encouraging dirty heating by letting hydro rape us?
8274 2018-01-19 20:35:19 Since oil is made up of organic pressurized carbon over millionsof years. There’s no way that developed realistically. Rock formation as evidenced by what we can currently measure happening. Formation of layers of ice that we can literally count like tree rings.
8275 2018-01-19 20:35:18 I feel no regret for the 4 pieces of pizza and equivalent 6 tablespoons of oil that I swallowedlast night. Just saying.
8276 2018-01-19 20:35:17 Castor oil. Works best when your face is wet when you apply
8277 2018-01-19 20:35:12 COCONUT OIL + SUGAR. Mix together until it’s a gritty texture and then scrub your skin with it. Then your skin will be silky smoooooth
8278 2018-01-19 20:35:11 @mixdgrlproblems have you or anyone you know tried the Shea Moisture castor oil shampoo? Did you like it? What conditioner did you use with it?
8279 2018-01-19 20:35:11 Please consider CBD oil which is made from the hemp plant and has no THC psychoactive properties in it . CBD stands for cannabinoids and over the years it has been proven without a doubt it can cure many kinds of cancers with no side effects. Please do some research on it.
8280 2018-01-19 20:35:09 Global oil stocks already below historical 5 year average, wonder if all OPEC members are gonna stick to the production cuts agreed upon

8283 2018-01-19 20:34:30 Gold is, always has been & always will be a political economic tool that can be used as a weapon.  The way China deployed it in 2014 was as a weapon v the Petrodollar system.  In 2014, China forced the US to choose EITHER expensive oil OR cheap gold, no longer both (low GOR)
8284 2018-01-19 20:34:28 Republicans are against abortions because big oil needs bodies to fight their wars.
8285 2018-01-19 20:34:21 Bro give me a regular oil change today thanks

8287 2018-01-19 20:33:57 Ha ha! I ordered mine on Jumia, yet to receive it though . Also saw some at Casa Bella in Ado Bayero Mall, Kano. But peppermint oil is  an essential oil, you shouldn't use it alone but with a carrier oil like almond, olive, coconut, etc
8288 2018-01-19 20:33:54 Just got a free oil change at firestone bc they were understaffed and everyone was being a bitch about wait times except for me lmaooooooooo dont be a dick, folks

8291 2018-01-19 20:33:28 Even the dispersement of people around the globe as evidence by the skeletons of people in America suggest that the earth is old. Graves in America’s that are 10,000 years plus shouldn’t be there if the earth is young. Plate tectonics show an old earth. The existence of oil
8292 2018-01-19 20:33:24 Shut it down Dems, give them a taste of their own caster oil.
8293 2018-01-19 20:33:24 This always happens when its trade season. Oil players get hurt and save themselves. Time to clean house.
8294 2018-01-19 20:33:23 OIL OFF THE STOCK MARKET!

I was in a line-up and a guy in front of me was speaking to his friend and he simply stated the smartest thing i've heard in awhile, simply oil should be off the stock market completely.
8295 2018-01-19 20:33:14 What products are you using on it? I was told today that water with Olive oil are a perfect combo for the fro.  Do your mix in a spray bottle and pray your fro every after 2 days....it should be soft in no time
8296 2018-01-19 20:33:12 Took a man to put this out in public like that. Thank you, Will for being a brave enough man to do this.

8298 2018-01-19 20:33:10 Do you know where the revenue came from? Take away oil money and your artificially inflated revenues see you going bust
8299 2018-01-19 20:33:08 Going to try oil pulling.
8300 2018-01-19 20:32:56 Agreed.  What gold settlement/open window added for China & Russia was the ability to enforce that if the US wanted higher oil prices, it was going to have to adjust the USD/Gold, rather than US/Oil, which screws China (immediately) & Russia (in the longer term - see '08).
8301 2018-01-19 20:32:53 Ntwana because she tries some funny shit nna ke tshela oil in the same kettle.
8302 2018-01-19 20:32:38 If oil really is consolidating for a squeeze here, USO 13.44 is where we short it again.  UNREAL.  No puke whatsoever (yet).   It's been since 11/24 that there's been any yank of note.
8303 2018-01-19 20:32:32 Playing politics with the Keystone decision? @realdonaldtrump vetos 20,000 jobs and cheaper oil.

8307 2018-01-19 20:32:09 The best outcome that can happen now can be found on the path you walk now. Sharing your pain, your tragedy, to spare others from the same fate isn't just courageous; it's a Godly act of compassion.
8308 2018-01-19 20:32:00 If it is onr PDVSA employee,he should say WE are desperate to maintain production. And certainly what oil company does not? Ask Chevron, Exxon,Aranco,if they are not desperate to maintain and even increase production.
8309 2018-01-19 20:31:48 give me oil in my lampxxxxxx
8310 2018-01-19 20:31:37 A hardened heart will see it ok. The world is going mad.

8313 2018-01-19 20:31:16 Gold is priced in oil not vice versa. China aims for successful buy side futures contract. Gold adds trust to clearing but nothing to pricing.  China can achieve aim of spot oil price reduction ($ ,Yuan, € whatever) only if physical oil demand is diverted from ICE Brent platform

8320 2018-01-19 20:30:31 Paul Ryan has an oil painting at home that is absolutely suffused with self-loathing.
8321 2018-01-19 20:30:28 Excellent quote in The Guardian ‘ Andy Carroll at his best is English football’s own one man medieval siege tower, wheeled into place, drenched in oil and blood and sent of clanking towards the battlements in a whirl of flaming arrows’
8322 2018-01-19 20:30:25 Awesome more power to you but remember the military doesn’t take care of it’s veterans and only cares about the oil and not the psychological effects that bombing people has on its soldiers. I recommend taking advantage of their therapists.
8323 2018-01-19 20:30:06 Avoid shampoos with sulfates or parabens, use shampoo sparingly, oil serum after washing and moisturizing to keep smooth and silky. I have curly, dyed hair can literally write you an essay.
8324 2018-01-19 20:30:02 #NationalPopcornDay    as a snack at home I can say it helped me lose weight after I switched from my long time potato chips and Doritos habit of bygone years. I favor the brand made with olive oil. ( 184 lbs. to 159 within a year).  I agree with James Brown: "Popcorn", baby!
8325 2018-01-19 20:29:57  oh, I see what you did there,  @Bertolli. Reduced your olive oil format by 25% from 1 Litre to 750 ml, kept the same base price of 13.99 and launched it with 40% off sales, but will most likely keep the same price moving forward #slowclap #zerointegrity #bertolli

8333 2018-01-19 20:29:18 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
8334 2018-01-19 20:29:07 Yeah, Obama only deported 2.7 million, handed $10 Trillion "recovery" to the .1%, flooded the world with record weapons sales (thanks Hillary!), paid sharia law terrorists in Syria to please Oil Co's & destroyed Libya - 1st Black POTUS brought back slave auctions! #GreenPartyUSA
8335 2018-01-19 20:28:38 So sorry to hear of this Will. Sometimes life rolls us with a steamroller and makes decisions hard. Those that are remembered are never truly lost.
8336 2018-01-19 20:28:25 Our military exists to serve national security, not to serve the institution of the military itself. At present, US domestic tight oil technology has dramatically reduced risk of military conflict with China. When the paradigm shifts, the military needs to adjust.
8337 2018-01-19 20:28:19 We can grow and prosper with Capitalism. If the United States was a Socialist Nation since the Birth then we would never have gotten companies like Apple to grow, and necessities such as Steel, electricity, gas, and oil to become more and more advanced with time.

8345 2018-01-19 20:27:21 How do you know what Obama said or did behind closed doors? Yes, he presented himself well, as any slick snake oil salesman should, but you know nothing of the man behind his public face.
8346 2018-01-19 20:27:19 God bless you and keep you, young man.
8347 2018-01-19 20:27:12 Remember, when the government shuts down, it takes at least THREE pulls of the cord to start it. Don't forget to prime it & put oil in it. Hold the hand-lever & put your back into it, damnit!

8350 2018-01-19 20:26:56 And just to make my day complete, I received a reply from @SenThomTillis that totally disregarded my stated concerns. It’s quite clear he did NOT read my letter and instead supports oil and rich oceanfront landowners. #pathetic #VoteHimOut
8351 2018-01-19 20:26:44 Gas prices soared here from 2.15 a gallon to 2.89 a gallon in the course of 2 months. Kerosene which many use for heat, went from 3.49 to 4.29 per gallon. Heating oil is outrageous here, costing over $300 for 100 gallons. Which does not last long in central PA weather.
8352 2018-01-19 20:26:43 Ever drink a red bull and decide to fix the garage door, change your oil, get new wipers, grocery shop and then take a kickboxing class. This is how my day is going. Wyd.
8353 2018-01-19 20:26:42 Point being oil is not priced in NZD, and that doesn't mean Kiwis cannot buy oil.

8356 2018-01-19 20:26:09 A gut wrenching story, but I’m glad you shared. I haven’t met a parent who looks at their child & wishes they had an abortion instead. Abortion creates many times, consequence-free sex for men: how does that empower women? (Not in your case. You have emotional consequences. )
8357 2018-01-19 20:26:07 Ofcourse we overlook that this would have never happened if there was a pipeline moving the oil instead of rail.

8363 2018-01-19 20:24:56 Exfoliating too much can dry the skin out and then cause it to become oily. The oil glands start to over produce. Just make sure you follow up with a good moisturizer. I run into the same problem cause my favorite scrub is the green tea st. Ives scrub

8374 2018-01-19 20:22:45 Our current stock market rally however seems to be based solely on the expectation or fulfillment of rollback of regulations, many of which are environmental. I guess everyone is optimistic when you can drill for oil right off the coast. Drill baby drill.

8390 2018-01-19 20:21:23 the "reset" of Gold/Oil ratio ever since (from 20-45x sustained post 9/14 v. 10-20x prior) suggest this is what happened.  China & Russia didn't want the US' deal w/Saudi to screw them; Holy Grail w/CNY pricing & open CNY gold window blew up US/Saudi deal.

8393 2018-01-19 20:21:14 @COP_Alaska: Add up all the new finds on the North Slope, and Alaska could add 400,000 barrels of oil per DAY into @AlyeskaPipeline’s TAPS in the coming years. The opportunity is there, but AK must provide a stable fiscal structure. #MeetAlaska18

8396 2018-01-19 20:20:36 So why couldn't we get Energy East pipeline passed with the "ethical advantage" of a carbon tax, instead Eastern Canada will continue to import their oil from Saudi Arabia.
8397 2018-01-19 20:20:30 Out here adulting like no other today  oil changed, paid my car note, and about to do my taxes. Like yesssss
8398 2018-01-19 20:20:24 I’ve added coconut oil to my face and everywhere after my shower and then onto my normal routine. Cetaphil is wonderful and then CeraVe for my hands and feet. It’s made a big difference for small expense.
8399 2018-01-19 20:20:18 Try @loccitaneusa almond shower oil as body wash then drizzle baby/body oil all over and quickly rub in *before* toweling off. Apply lotion only to really dry parts. Might take as much time but feels less labor intensive than just lotioning up to me. 
8400 2018-01-19 20:20:14 Oh, Will. I don’t even know what to say. I’m so sorry. I am so so sorry. 
8401 2018-01-19 20:20:11 Is there a can of waste oil somewhere in the shed?
8402 2018-01-19 20:20:09 since when did #mufc became the club players go for "the money" whiles players go to the oil rich #mcfc for the glory.
8403 2018-01-19 20:20:04 Taxes on gas & diesel are about what they were when Eisenhower was President.  These taxes are essentially user fees & helped fund the building of  the Interstate Hwy. System. Oil Companies like keeping them low so they can keep their percentage of the cost of gas for themselves.
8404 2018-01-19 20:20:04 ...IMO it wasn't end of US QE that drove oil px crash in 2014; it was CNY oil w/Chinese gold settlemt.  Gold prices skyrocketed in oil terms (13 bbls to 30x in 4 mths fr 9/14-1/15), but b/c "someone" was pegging USD/Gold, the gold/oil ratio rose via collapse in oil.

8409 2018-01-19 20:19:11 Put a coconut oil treatment In my hair and have washed it 4 times since then. Can not get it out and now I just look like I have not washed my hair in 10 days. Please help 
8410 2018-01-19 20:18:52 ...wizards grease their scalps with castor oil.
8411 2018-01-19 20:18:49 I hope you’ll find the forgiveness and grace and mercy you’re seeking. Willing to talk about this, in public, is one of the bravest thing I’ve seen a man do in a long time, and I’ve seen all sorts of badassery.
8412 2018-01-19 20:18:47 You're not going to like it. But I cut out all meat, oil and salt. No eating out. No processed foods. Limit bread to one serving/day and it has to be whole grain.  Basically I've just eaten soups and salads and oatmeal in the morning.
8413 2018-01-19 20:18:45 Curly makes sense in this context because it's got more surface area for the oil and lemon juice to collect. But the best parsley for the job is the parsley you already have, I suppose. 
8414 2018-01-19 20:18:44 The homie at work hooked it up with an oil and filter change for 20 bucks, that's wassup
8415 2018-01-19 20:18:38 True story. ‘Warning, low oil pressure!’ 
8416 2018-01-19 20:18:27 Are you really that stupid. We have the resources in bc to develop the LNG industries in a responsible manner. Businesses in the north need these pipelines and LNG to survive. Oil and gas generates a Large amount of revenue for you southerners. How will you make up for revenues?
8417 2018-01-19 20:18:22 Thanks for your personal testimony Will. We all certainly have things in our lives that we would do differently.
8418 2018-01-19 20:17:58 Just coconut oil? Do u have a before and after pics?
8419 2018-01-19 20:17:48 I got wild growth too and it’s crazy cause I’m going to the beauty supply today to get me some tea tree oil 
8420 2018-01-19 20:17:44 ANY PRIMER RECOMMENDATIONS!?!? 
 
My skin is dry as hell sooooo idk what to get  i was thinking the smash box primer oil but i want other opinions
8421 2018-01-19 20:17:23 という訳で寝れません..
8422 2018-01-19 20:17:23 Agreed, the strat to "make oil big enough to back USD" ran into a problem in the form of China/Russia.  Obama's version of deal could only wk w/oil px'd/settled in 1 ccy.  Once China/Russia began selling CNY oil & then opened gold window Sep-14, gold became oil's reference pt...
8423 2018-01-19 20:16:41 that means you want 21 spoons of warm oil
8424 2018-01-19 20:16:40 I don't think so. The Misto just works as an air pump to aerosolize the oil. Water & oil don't mix all that well anyway.
8425 2018-01-19 20:16:38 Do you recommend bio oil for stretch marks and hyperpigmentation...
8426 2018-01-19 20:16:32 Here in D.C. marching for you </3
8427 2018-01-19 20:16:27 But the fact you didn't win means you will never know if it was scaremongering or not,unlike oil dropping to tuppence a barrel which would have destroyed the country but no thank yous required
8428 2018-01-19 20:16:21 Fr lol I had to use olive oil to help get these through
8429 2018-01-19 20:15:56 Usually they catch fire due to massive lubricant loss. But the greenies don't seem to mind hundreds of gallons of oil and fire retardants spewing onto farmland if it comes from one of their own infernal machines.
8430 2018-01-19 20:15:51 If you blame 2007 crash, then you could also blame the debt loads of most EU countries (ex Germany) BEFORE 2007, UK property bubble 2002-2007, too low retirement ages especially Greece. UK peak oil in year 2000. High costs of War On Terror. Now add in North Africa after 2011...
8431 2018-01-19 20:15:39 @whatthefack16 be proud. I have oil in my car
8432 2018-01-19 20:15:39 I think we would like to know that to, if we have all this energy it should benefit citizens first not someone overseas, We need to start asking congressmen and senators that question and also need to make it clear high prices here unacceptable when we have so much oil and gas.
8433 2018-01-19 20:15:37 "Saved by the Bell", which according to @MerriamWebster is likely a boxing reference, was being explained as a premature burial reference. Except those devices were mostly snake oil even in their time and unlikely to have entered the vernacular.
8434 2018-01-19 20:15:36 Does the UK manufacture Palm Oil?
8435 2018-01-19 20:15:32 i bet you didn't realize that "oil and vinegar" is an anagram for "olive garden."

Youre right there are pros and cons to everything. But is that a reason to make far reaching conclusions?

8462 2018-01-19 20:11:29 High energy prices are what's going to pop the bubble, and very well could be from a geopolitical event. No secret Fed, BOJ, and ECB want low oil prices to keep the fake recovery alive.

8482 2018-01-19 20:09:19 That whole scene was memorable. So much so I tried it at home—like that very night. Olive oil, the spoon, the flame. It wasn’t great.
8483 2018-01-19 20:09:11 Excellent point. Weather risk into Texas/SC even more relevant now. No only demand goes up (known stuff) but as NG by-production from roaring oil plays there becomes more significant for nationwide balance & LNG/Mexports also drain some of those flows, pdx goes down (new stuff).
8484 2018-01-19 20:09:07 Cuaca lagi dingin 2 hari ini plus AC baru diservis = freezing.

Hope the dermocal helps. I have used bio oil in the past & that does help the scars heal better & be less prominent.
8489 2018-01-19 20:08:13 EVERY time I get an oil change they find some other filter that should be replaced  #brokebish

8493 2018-01-19 20:07:28 The instagram people who just eat/drink disgusting looking shit then talk about how it has some oil in it that solves every problem you’ve ever had are my favorite
8494 2018-01-19 20:07:26 JM @ #MeetAlaska18: No other state or local government where I’ve been has such a focus on the topic of oil taxes. And how to continually raise them. Every year feels like Groundhog Day.
8495 2018-01-19 20:07:19 Gotta add coconut oil too boo
8496 2018-01-19 20:07:14 My sister did 4 years prison time for Meth possession. It was hell on the whole family. I've tried Adderall, but it's just...No. Too damn jumpy, and for kids? No fck'n way! Weed is just fine, always has been. Cannabis oil works wonders, I'm convinced they want us to die.
8497 2018-01-19 20:07:14 The IEA is suggesting just a price cap bc of the oil run lately but demand hasn’t moved and supply looks set to increase. This situation = volatile
8498 2018-01-19 20:07:10 OIL DIFF: 5.38 -> 5.39
8499 2018-01-19 20:07:07 It might be you’re drawing up too fast. But tiny bubbles are okay. T is thick and in oil so go slow with it.
8500 2018-01-19 20:07:06 
8501 2018-01-19 20:06:51 I like salads with a lot of olive oil so I get free chapstick
8502 2018-01-19 20:06:40 Dr. Gupta is a Neurologist I believe. Having him diagnose cardiovascular ailments is like having an electrician try and replace the oil pump in your car engine.
8503 2018-01-19 20:06:33 Thanks, there's certainly a risk of that. I should have made clearer -- this graphic is from an ocean model predicting the path any oil on the surface would take over 3 months. Still a lot of unknowns about how much oil would remain on that timescale (more in story)
8504 2018-01-19 20:06:31 Did u actually read it??? It says we made a profit!! Even on a 13month reporting period that includes extra costs and no income! It’s from 16-17. There was no oil money invested then....Just revenue generated. Why does it bother you so much?
8505 2018-01-19 20:06:18 I'm thinking the sprayer would work...just need small amount of camelia oil on your hair & that makes it just oil & nothing else.
8506 2018-01-19 20:06:15 So this Tory is correct but every other one is talking bullshit eh? 
Oil has gone down the pan for good sunshine, it's actually costing us money to extract it

8512 2018-01-19 20:05:56 Obama is corrupt! Every president in my lifetime is corrupt to a degree. They pick winners & losers by letting donors & future donors get what they ask for. Letting Big oil get what they ask for has a lot to do with what we could’ve done. Oil prices r tied to market but still .

8543 2018-01-19 20:02:06 I have said for years that Obama adopted 1973/4 Kissinger strategy with same aim of resilience/energy security. This time Saudi (ex Yamani) & not Iran, were too dumb/greedy. When US QE ended in  2014 oil price caved to $45/$50 as I forecast in 2011/12 it would
8544 2018-01-19 20:01:59 Oh, Come on! Of course they’re related, and causal.  It doesn’t mean it’s the only cause, but drug pipelines are as valuable as oil pipelines, and drug profiting was certainly one of the reasons for the invasion.

8551 2018-01-19 20:01:18 In visit to Miami, @FLGovScott says on oil drilling that Secretary Zinke is "a man of his word." Says he's confident they have an understanding.
8552 2018-01-19 20:01:15 100% agree. BP is one of the criminal oil companies ensuring petrol remains expensive for consumers
8553 2018-01-19 20:01:03 I gotta buy coconut oil when I get out of work just for my hair lmao
8554 2018-01-19 20:00:59 For those interested in making some good money, try being a celebritiarian. People will buy whatever pyramid scheme or snake oil you're selling just because you're one of them. If someone calls you out, you'll have an army of fervent defenders who will fight for you.

8558 2018-01-19 20:00:49 Fish oil good for you so jokes on you
8559 2018-01-19 20:00:47 Whip together 8 oz dairy with 4 tsps chicken. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Squeeze out excess liquid Serve for brunch
8560 2018-01-19 20:00:39 Chow down on Bok Choy!  Just wash the leaves, separate, slice, then sauté or steam with a little oil and a dash of low sodium soy sauce. Pick some up Saturday from 10 am - 1 pm at the Clarkstown Indoor Farmers Market, 6 Gilchrest Road, Congers. #ShopHealthyRockland @rocklandgov
8561 2018-01-19 20:00:35 The more we as American people oppose the more he seems to strike back. Unfortunately he won’t do anything because it’s down to money from the oil companies and other special interest groups. And Zinke is the biggest offender.

8565 2018-01-19 20:00:08 (AP) _ Three men charged in a criminal negligence trial stemming from a 2013 oil train derailment that killed 47 people in Lac Megantic in Quebec have all been found not guilty.

8569 2018-01-19 19:59:54 I wonder if I could use one of those Misto sprayer pumps you can use to aerosolize olive or other oils for camelia oil? #Idea #Brainwave #Experiment
8570 2018-01-19 19:59:24 Hey at least I do not have to deal with those annoying Joe Kennedy free oil commercials.
8571 2018-01-19 19:59:20 #HealthyTip : Coconut oil can burn fat and promote weight loss, according to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
8572 2018-01-19 19:59:07 Oil companies never pay the full cost of their business.  They offload "externalities" onto society. If there's an oil spill, government pays for cleanup. If people die, they say it's not their fault. 

Oil companies' business model is #OurRiskTheirReward
8573 2018-01-19 19:59:06 Hmm, when I was sick my grandma would always say “Some castor oil and an enema will fix that up in a jiffy.” As well as a gallon of cranberry juice. Generally no one stayed home sick from my house. I didn’t really care as long as she changed the diapers. Avoid castor oil though.
8574 2018-01-19 19:59:06 The profit was £1.1m and that was after oil money. Maths really isn't your thing is it
8575 2018-01-19 19:58:45 People need to be told why exploiting the resources with increased oil drilling is bad? Have people really already forgotten?

Oil like coal is the past.
8576 2018-01-19 19:58:41 The oil company people were right outside my window while I was listening to The Strokes on full volume. You're welcome fellas
8577 2018-01-19 19:58:40 They've been predicting Peak Oil for nearly 200 years now, so, can we safely push back the Peak Oil predictions yet another decade?

Airpop, coconut oil, chili,cin,curry. 
Yayyyyyyy!
Thanks Dad!
8579 2018-01-19 19:58:30 Becasue they have already done it twice.  When the tax bill was approved...the Republicans added more things under the rug.   Oil deal with Cornyn and Cruz was added.   Need to get Chip and Daca deal with this time.
8580 2018-01-19 19:58:29 He is the CEO of URL...cooking oil, bathing soap etc, .. Past President of CZI...& a business mentor to many executives in Zimbabwe

8582 2018-01-19 19:58:14 Wow, I am disappointed. My son is allergic to peanuts and I just found out @ChickfilA  uses peanut oil to fry their potatoes and chicken. Where are your signs? And your staff were not aware if they used it or not.  #keeptheminformed #ChickfilA #Peanutallergy
8583 2018-01-19 19:58:03 Cancer is horrible and many more will suffer and die from it due to your vote with the #GOPTaxScam.  Please don’t act like you care because you don’t. You’re a FRAUD!  At least your BIG OIL DONORS are happy
8584 2018-01-19 19:57:59 Iit’s not hard fr. I got wild hair growth in my shampoo and while it’s wet i put a little tea treat oil and let it air dry  never knew that simple stuff would have my hair growing that much
8585 2018-01-19 19:57:45 Yes you can buy camelia oil separately. I have some but the trick is getting just the right amount on the brush or comb so you don't totally grease up your hair. It is used also to keep metal blades from rusting. I need to see about making it into a spray (like cooking spray)...

8587 2018-01-19 19:57:22 Hubby is sore from reffing 3 games in a row last night so i have an epsom salt and essential oil bath set up for when he gets home as a surprise. Don’t forget to spoil your man!
8588 2018-01-19 19:57:09 Real "hockey" fans will watch any hockey, any time. I watched Pens/Kings & Bruins/Islanders last night. Oil fans just watch Oilers games.
8589 2018-01-19 19:57:02 Might be time for a new car. Exhaust leak, coolent leak, small oil leak. Guessing I'll look at new ones while I wait to get a quote on the damage.
8590 2018-01-19 19:57:01 We accuse Buhari of paying over N450billion in oil subsidy after claiming it has been stopped under his Govt, he responded by claiming $500million recovered from the Abacha family was re looted by GEJ Govt. Isorite!
8591 2018-01-19 19:56:59 Did you know...

Delta with Asaba as its capital is the second largest oil producing state in the country producing about 21.56% . There is a refinery and petrochemical plant in warri, the heart beat of Delta.

Warri no dey carry last!!!!

8592 2018-01-19 19:56:55 The BILLIONS have been pooled and shared around the UK, more than made up for what the oil has paid in, especially now we're consistently £15bn in deficit every year.
8593 2018-01-19 19:56:48 Good idea! I usually put argan oil in my hair, but that just doesn't seem to be doing it! I'll have to try jojoba 
8594 2018-01-19 19:56:39 You are correct, there was NO debate. And you intentionally kept Democrats from seeing or writing the budget bill with you. Why would they vote on something they don’t know what it is?  You are snake oil with a turtle neck. #NoMoreRepublicans
8595 2018-01-19 19:56:19 I’ve burnt my arms and hands on hot oil.
8596 2018-01-19 19:56:14 The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
8597 2018-01-19 19:56:13 You're saying it like it's a bad thing 94% of the coast isn't being ruined oil derricks
8598 2018-01-19 19:56:05 We usually just go with the original shabu shabu base. Then add our own stuff inside the water. Soy, garlic, chili, oil, etc.
8599 2018-01-19 19:56:04 “Energy sector is gaining strength...”. Was there a typo?  Should it have read, the “green energy sector?” Or are you taking credit for the oil and gas rebound?  Something the NDP can’t stand?
8600 2018-01-19 19:55:52 We could have refused to allow corrupt foreign companies to operate on our soil.

And of course, we could just #KeepItInTheGround .

Oil companies are notoriously unethical. Doing business with any of them is a mistake. Giving up control is a mistake.

Shut down @NEBCanada

8609 2018-01-19 19:55:11 So why @kesa_143 saying that people foot need vegetable and car oil?! #Overdo
8610 2018-01-19 19:55:11 Are you suggesting Stalin killed because of his ideology? No. He killed to cling onto power. 

The US started the wars to get cheap oil.
8611 2018-01-19 19:55:09 How does potential demise of #petrodollar factor in?
If countries don't have to purchase oil in USD anymore, USD might take a big hit
China/Russia working on this now, with Iran

8614 2018-01-19 19:55:01 Dinner = roasted peppered beef, baked mushroom with blue cheese, olive oil and soy sauce on a toasted brioche roll.
8615 2018-01-19 19:54:58 Can you buy camellia oil separately?  Might be cheaper ?
8616 2018-01-19 19:54:49 Plain white kernels, in covered container in microwave on high, then spray with butter flavored canola oil as you eat it, salting occasionally. Yum.
8617 2018-01-19 19:54:49 So thats how I miss road and entered harrods to go and buy diffuser! Just ordinary oil hmmm! Uncle said its £500....I had to ask if all the angels in heaven will bring my blessings if they smell it
8618 2018-01-19 19:54:39 There are a lot of resources..diamonds and golds,Uranium, Congo forest and depot for Trophy huntings/ without sub Saharan Africa-no cell phone in the world. Crude oil all over. All sub Saharan Africa needs in transparent leadership.
8619 2018-01-19 19:54:29 Hilarious. But his taunts are classic. Before I go for a weekly beer get together with my human friends, I'd love to hear the sarcastic taunt of the wise elephant against the dumb dumb bulls.

8621 2018-01-19 19:54:04 I hate when a girl dates someone and the boyfriends parents ask her if she can cook.... can your son change her tire, check her oil, or even know what coolant is? No? So stfu

8626 2018-01-19 19:53:32 The Harper government could have enforced safety rules instead of kowtowing to the oilpatch.

We could have put in rules that prevented transhipment of oil across provincial lines.

We could have demanded OilCos pay for the risks, instead of getting fed gov to pay.
8627 2018-01-19 19:53:19 Did you know... 

Currently Rivers State refines more crude oil than any other state in the country accounting for 21.43% of the total produce??

8631 2018-01-19 19:52:56 Oil of clove. On a cotton wool ball, bite down on it. Numbs the poorly area brilliantly.  Also...Valium.
8632 2018-01-19 19:52:46 US #EnergyDominance strategy (since 1 July 2017) is to support oil at high price so US funds finance shale oil production cf #DrillCo. Evidence oil is financialised by direct monetisation is negative correlation between $ & oil. Outcome is high oil/low  dollar & benefits you cite

8636 2018-01-19 19:52:13 Substantial hit for Oil Machine could seal their plight.
8637 2018-01-19 19:51:25 It’s like they are all getting a big free box of adult diapers ... but seriously they are smirking like the Evil Monsters they are ... to ramp up oil instead of embracing clean green renewables is an attack against humanity itself ! I despise him truly !

8639 2018-01-19 19:51:23 He was killed for wanting to only trade his oil for the gold dinar he was trying to establish.  Same reason we went after Saddam Hussein. He didn't want to accept dollars for oil.
8640 2018-01-19 19:51:18 It's all those Republicans.

And when we replace them all with Democrats, all the corruption will go aw.....

...wait...

...I forgot, the Democrats are in bed with the same donors: big pharma, big oil, wall street, war profiteers, private prisons, payday lenders, big ag, silicon
8641 2018-01-19 19:51:18 I feel like an adult today. Woke up early, filed my taxes, got an oil changed. Im ready to take on the world today.

8647 2018-01-19 19:50:45 Bernie fans: he just criticized the republicans for impacting the operation of the US military. If you're against permanent war and 50% of your tax dollars going to the arms industry and the millions of deaths for oil at their hands you'll call him out on this, loudly.
8648 2018-01-19 19:50:41 @Patriotgirl1960 As in say.....South Korea and Venezuela! Even with oil it's turned into a ...what's the current buzzword?
8649 2018-01-19 19:50:37 When at the dr office, someone should at least be giving my car an oil change. #waitingoveranhour

8669 2018-01-19 19:47:21 People need a reality check... If the rich oil man hadn't of bought City... do you think they'd be that MASSIVE 12 points clear that you said they are? Or have the calibre of players they have now? They was a mid table team before he turned up.. without him they're fucked

8672 2018-01-19 19:47:14 Do you know if there will ever be a FULL release of the soundtrack? Because this one is missing a few tracks like Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and Oil Ocean, as well as the ending cutscenes music.
8673 2018-01-19 19:46:55 Apparently the Magnolia tissue oil (from PEP) does wonders sis.
8674 2018-01-19 19:46:46 The enthusiasm of the IEA is certainly brave, if not realistic.  How much ultra-light USTO does the globe really need?  Not much more.  Oil isn't all the same, and assuming it is makes for a very imprecise thesis.  WCS is needed, with the drop in PdVSA.  Not ULSC.
8675 2018-01-19 19:46:45 I’m using coconut oil my tattoo guy said not to use loads because it makes the ink more likely to bleed . Also this isn’t my first tattoo my dude I’m just lazy

8679 2018-01-19 19:46:02 there's a long list. here's a good example: fossil fuels (incl. oil) are proven to cause health problems. costs of care are paid by us, thereby subsidizing the cost of the products (say gas).

low price means we drive more, ++ demand. 
++ #bigoil profits.

8690 2018-01-19 19:43:50 If I told the car place that I have been exposed to the flu, would that help them change my oil faster? Or no difference...?

8692 2018-01-19 19:43:12 And there is a lot more to Scotland than oil.

8697 2018-01-19 19:41:57 Just read the ingredients in my deodorant, and I’m wondering why there’s castor oil in it??? @DegreeWomen is this some ploy to make women’s armpit hair grow faster?????
8698 2018-01-19 19:41:54 Coconut oil is a miracle substance when you’re blowing your nose every 3 minutes.
8699 2018-01-19 19:41:54 Was gonna nap after work but probs should get an oil change and workout 
8700 2018-01-19 19:41:32 Why?  Because they want to run out of economic oil within the next 10 years?  That isn't the plan.  If the world wants oil, they have to discover, and exploit, reserves.  <70 Brent does not support this effort.  The end result will be demand vastly outstripping ready supply.
8701 2018-01-19 19:41:26 My advice to the top end of Caerau when the snake oil salesmen come promising £100 off your energy bill.  First Question Ask for a free survey of your house and a commitment that they will rectify in writing any damage.

8710 2018-01-19 19:40:26 But since his ascent, 40% increase in share value, blue collar workers benefited more than Obama regime, US producing more oil than Saudi Arabia. Trump does what h3 is elected for. Like Brexit bashing, journalists& media attack Trump.

8716 2018-01-19 19:39:34 I should see what mine is at, I got my letter saying I'm due for my 8k oil change. I admit it had gone up, back in the day they wanted you in every 5k for an oil change. My longest I went with my accord as 1 full year before my service light went on.
8717 2018-01-19 19:39:23 Environmental causes such as pollution, exposure to oil and grease could be also be a factor because you’re breaking out. Lack of sleep can also cause this and of course stress. 

Take a step back and also spot anything you’ve been eating recently, that also could be a trigger.
8718 2018-01-19 19:39:11 Cheap lies by this lady. We lost S. Sudan & Uganda oil pipeline, Ethiopian railway to Djibouti all because you and your busybody friends  support alshabab and other extremr groupings.
8719 2018-01-19 19:38:41 Did you know...

8748 2018-01-19 19:34:50 This chart should worry you.  Global demand for oil is not dropping, and will not drop for some time.  Supply, however, has approached a peak, ex-USTO.  Tight oil does not breakeven at 45, or 50, or 55.  As the global demand needs USTO, the price will reflect this source.

8755 2018-01-19 19:33:26 You think oil only used in cars?!
almost everything is made with oil at some point
8756 2018-01-19 19:33:24 1/2 Agreed - this has been such a long time coming.  I think this has led to chronic underinvestment in capex (less oil) for decades.
8757 2018-01-19 19:33:21 Knew you was old, but riding a vesper (name of your horse?) in 1880 shows your true age  even oil of Olay can’t work it’s magic on you

8820 2018-01-19 19:25:41 @EugenieSage I'd like to mention the way you ignore anything about the seismic blasting in Blue Whale and Little Blue Penguin's. There is also a search for oil in the same area, Taranaki, where Maui Dolphins live. Would you like to say why you allow this to happen?

She provides not only crude oil but gas and accounts for 0.68% of oil produced in Nigeria daily. 

Where are my Abia people atttt???

8832 2018-01-19 19:24:17 Cook on medium-high heat. Don't use the highest setting you'll burn your food and warp your pans. Use butter/Pam/oil to prevent stickage (preferably Pam or oil). Watch the perimeter of the egg and check for bubbles. When you see bubbles it's time to flip (like pancakes)

8838 2018-01-19 19:23:47 Voters who believe @realdonaldtrump's lies are the same simple, foolish people who, throughout history, have been easy prey for used car salesmen, snake oil scams, get-rich-quick pyramid schemes., etc  As a lifelong huckster, Trump knew they were easy targets.

8856 2018-01-19 19:21:03 I never said I don't want KM built. Pipelines are safer and more cost-effective than shipping oil by rail.
But there's probably a few hundred thousand folks in BC who don't want it built. You think it can be rammed through?
8857 2018-01-19 19:20:54 Hi Rojadean!
I just stumbled upon your beautiful pictures and I was wondering if I could use them as reference material for my watercolor and oil paintings. I sell my art, prints and create painting videos on YouTube and wanted to check if this would be okay with you.

8880 2018-01-19 19:17:33 Can you think of any reasons why oil would incrise between 1975 and 1980?

8902 2018-01-19 19:14:35 You won’t damage your natural hair if you taking care of it. Most weaves are sewed-in in a way where the thread cuts your hair and makes it worst. A simply wash n go with conditioner and oil or ponytail will make your hair grow fast as hell and curls bounce.

8928 2018-01-19 19:10:56 Cheap to produce oil does not get sold cheaply. In a global market it gets sold at the price of the marginal barrel.

8942 2018-01-19 19:08:04 Ability to produce oil cheaply does not equate to supplying it cheaply in a global market with price set by marginal barrels. Still less supplying the world with it. But it does equate to gigantic profit if you have access on preferential terms. Which was the US/UK Iraq gameplan

One the corporations in Europe needed slave wages without appearance of shackles.  2nd their may be oil in those areas and govt officials were bribed...

8968 2018-01-19 19:03:42 No, but you had to add the two stroke oil directly to the petrol in the tank and if you got the mix wrong you'd set off in a cloud of smoke fit for an old steam train. The first time I ever came to Harlow was on my Vespa.

8980 2018-01-19 19:01:53 You are clearly unfamiliar with Matt Simmons book 'Twilight in the Desert' which apparently convinced Cheney it's downhill all the way for Saudi. Indeed, if it were the case that oil price outlook is positive &/or reserves healthy they would not be IPO'ing Aramco

9002 2018-01-19 18:58:37 Biggest source of oil pollution to the Ocean - "Millions of motor vehicle engines drop small amounts of oil each day onto roads and parking lots."   @KnowYourH20
9003 2018-01-19 18:58:34 This is an interesting argument, but there are over a million oil wells in the US alone. I doubt there are more than a handful of lithium mines in the US. Plus it’s not just the wells that make pollution, it’s the combustion of the oil products by mechanical engines as well.
9004 2018-01-19 18:58:20 When Iran was banned by UN for couple of yrs & transaction for oil export was prevented by UN, at that time India didn't pay for crude import.Worse, that fund was not kept aside by MMS for later payment.Due was 2.5 lakh cr. This is how CONg runs govt !!

9026 2018-01-19 18:54:37 Opening up our public lands to private mining and drilling is wrong on many levels. Not the least of which is putting vulnerable and precious water supplies at risk.

9044 2018-01-19 18:52:31 As for the use in plastics, EIA data itself is not reliable. Read the fine print. Crude oil's byproduct is still used in making plastic. And again, plastic is just one use.

9083 2018-01-19 18:46:51 Why are we blindly expanding carbon based infrastructure -& giving them electricity to do it? Suck it up,fund alt energy research/ initiatives, & "leap" to a drop dead date for oil/gas energy. Entrepreneurial businesses could do this in ten years with the will.
9084 2018-01-19 18:46:37 Venezuela will be the next country we ‘help’-help ourselves to their oil that is
9085 2018-01-19 18:46:37 They need to read about the Harleen scheme. Standing charge. Heat Exchanger the size of a fridge outside the house. Look whose involved . My first question would be Are these snake oil salesmen I can trust ?
9086 2018-01-19 18:46:22 Seems a new calculation may make the political donations from Big Oil more attractive than local support. The Trump Party may get hammered in FL in November, but this will ensure Big Oil donations will still keep flowing their way for years to come.
9087 2018-01-19 18:46:17 #NationalPopcornDay - What is the best type of oil to pop your popcorn in, assuming you avoid the toxic microwave kind?

I think olive oil is better, but the BEST, is popcorn you can eat while reading mind blowing documents when they #ReleaseTheMemo

9088 2018-01-19 18:45:53 I just paid $15 for a little ass bottle or oil for my hair.

9090 2018-01-19 18:45:39 I whould trueMy dad told me since my mom used the medical oil he is the luckiest man alive
9091 2018-01-19 18:45:33 Yay!  did you drink it or pour it in there? Pouring warm oil worked for my younger brother
9092 2018-01-19 18:45:32 I love when my high ass hides oil from myself and find it months later :-)
9093 2018-01-19 18:45:24 another nice thing is to sear some chicken in olive oil, then mix up 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2-3 tbsp of honey, quarter cup of water, and some garlic and pour it over the chicken. slice a lemon, toss it in there, and then let the chicken simmer until it's cooked through.
9094 2018-01-19 18:45:18 Just exfoliated my face with salt and olive oil and OHMAGOODNESS, my face feels so amazing again 
9095 2018-01-19 18:45:18 Need to get this oil change but I’m lacking all motivation to get up rn 
9096 2018-01-19 18:45:16 I’m not ready to go to Jiffy Lube next week for this oil change. Shit be hurting my pockets lol.

9100 2018-01-19 18:44:41 Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil. I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk. I decked thee ...

9103 2018-01-19 18:44:08 A little advice from me to you today... if you ever have something "go down the wrong pipe", try to make sure it's not oil and vinegar salad dressing. Because, vinegar. #ItBurns #Tears #MakeItStopPlease
9104 2018-01-19 18:44:07 *drinks the oil happily* omg this oil is so delicious

9107 2018-01-19 18:43:51 why did they have to specify the oil was warm 
9108 2018-01-19 18:43:46 So Nigeria with over 30 Billion Barrels in proven oil reserves allows African Depopulation project manager Bill Gates to settle their $76 Million debt with Japan. African Leaders are really fucked up
9109 2018-01-19 18:43:31 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
9110 2018-01-19 18:43:30 Yea but oil pump gears don't explode as often

9112 2018-01-19 18:43:17 Best hurry if you want to witness any natural wonders in our country.  Zinke will make sure they are all open for mining or drilling for oil.
9113 2018-01-19 18:43:05 Of course! I just use a Shea moisturizer’s African black soap bar, witch hazel w/ rose water (Thayer’s), and moisturize my face with the ponds blue top moisturizer! For my dark spots I use vitamin e oil works wonders! 
9114 2018-01-19 18:42:54 You must have led quite the rough life cuz you look old as hell. You actually look quite a bit older then Nancy. That says a lot about you. I suggest you get off Twitter and go get some Oil of Olay or ponds. Something to get those wrinkles out of your skin.

9117 2018-01-19 18:42:40 It is all based on cost and cost of fuel. The concord was a solution but cost were too high and the program shut down. What we need are more fuel efficient engines but fuel efficiency means less profit for old world oil magnates
9118 2018-01-19 18:42:32 That Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil shampoo my hair absolutely loves. And I do use their lotions/bodywashes
9119 2018-01-19 18:42:28 In thinking about CT shoreline, most of it is LI sound (how much of that is federal not state?) and hard to imagine oil drilling in path to/from New London naval base.

9122 2018-01-19 18:42:20 Products with petroleum in them dry skin out in the long run. Petroleum is a cheap filler. Use products that actually moisturize skin. Olive oil, coconut oil, sweet almond oil, jojoba oil. Edible grade oils are best since they aren’t mixed with cheap fillers.
9123 2018-01-19 18:41:55 Sooo I knew my skin was oily so I use a face oil and moisturize every day to help prevent it from producing excess oil but APPARENTLY my skin is actually dehydrated and that's why I produce extra oil..... So I need to use hydrating products rather than matte.... What....

9131 2018-01-19 18:41:02 Had to replace my car battery. Got the oil changed this morning. Scheduled an appointment to get new tires. Then, my door handle fell off. PULL IT TOGETHER FERNANDO.
9132 2018-01-19 18:40:50 Oh yumm!!! I will have to try it. I think they’d be better with a dry seasoning on it. The ones I had it seemed like it was solidified oil.. tasted kinda greasy.

9134 2018-01-19 18:40:37 there's gotta be enough olive oil for the both of us
9135 2018-01-19 18:40:36 But the price of gas is going to go higher. I know this isn't Trump fault but the greedy oil company
9136 2018-01-19 18:40:36 There’s better ways to use oil than burning it. We need it to make all sorts of stuff, and we need it to last for a long time. Burning it when we don’t have to makes no real sense objectively.
9137 2018-01-19 18:40:31 Wow...but these rappers would NEVER apologize for lyrics calling for murdering police...FFS
9138 2018-01-19 18:40:30 My car has oil.  Stop suggesting my car is a loose confederation of autonomous units.  If my car gets invaded because of this I’m gonna be a little mad.

9142 2018-01-19 18:40:05 Glad you asked, Joe. Ms. Weiss is referring to the amount of oil production from her @BP_Alaska team. 280 is the number of barrels (in millions) it would take to hold production flat, and they reached it.
9143 2018-01-19 18:40:04 Apparently there is oil in western province and northwestern province ... 
9144 2018-01-19 18:40:00 How do we reach Trump's base? They are inundated with right wing radio, TV, email and social channels... I say we need to expose how Trump and cabinet is the swamp. And, how GOP leaders sold out to special interests like oil and gas

9146 2018-01-19 18:39:33 After some oil executive told them about a huge play offshore, I'm certain of it.
9147 2018-01-19 18:39:10 I deep fry all my food for health reasons. It's hard for parasites to survive boiling in 375 degree oil.
9148 2018-01-19 18:38:39 But...but...Kinder Morgan wants to lay a pipeline in a MOST DANGEROUS earthquake zone, then with those same brains are going to put the product into treacherous water zones.

9152 2018-01-19 18:38:28 @WLRN Rooney's claim about oil rigs off Santa Barbara is wildly misleading. All the offshore rigs were grandfathered. New new rigs allowed in state waters since 1969. None in fed waters off California since 1984.
9153 2018-01-19 18:38:26 The more time we spend at 63 on oil without breaking down the more i think its going to bounce and create divergence. Getting prepped either way

9156 2018-01-19 18:38:17 Got grease on my hands. Washed it off but they still smelled like oil. Washed again; every application of soap made the smell stronger. Did someone put grease in the soap dispenser?
9157 2018-01-19 18:37:57 You go I've heard that from many people from Oregon. Washington state had better wise up. Trump can get his oil for Russia & Exxon someplace else. They are already raping the artic

9162 2018-01-19 18:37:25 I personally cook with refined olive oil or rapeseed oil, and use virgin or extra virgin olive oil in dressings 
9163 2018-01-19 18:37:21 Let's say there's an oil rig. No one has enough resources to mine that oil, but we do. We sink millions into getting people and talent there to drill. We pay them land rights... Now some warlord comes along and wants to take the investment from you. The country has fallen.

9172 2018-01-19 18:36:15 yeah, i switched to grapeseed months ago since a friend gave me some, but it doesn't moisturize as much as i would like. granted, i probably wasn't hydrating well enough first, but i need a stronger oil to hold it in.
9173 2018-01-19 18:36:10 @MourMourcreme with the "Create your Own Creme" how many oils and how many butters can you add to your order? 

and what is the texture of the butters? is it hardened and melt in the hand? or does it change naturally like coconut oil depending on the weather like coconut oil?

9178 2018-01-19 18:35:21 Yeah, CBD oil doesn't give a high, but it can help with a few ailments, apparently. In cancer, there is some evidence it helps some chemo medications be more effective and at the very least it minimizes some of its side effects, some which are permanent.
9179 2018-01-19 18:35:21 You depend on some form of transport, even if you walk everywhere the goods get to the store in transport. I’m all for oil, plastics, whatever, provided you can make them and capture the off gasses.

9187 2018-01-19 18:34:18 Have you tried coconut oil?
9188 2018-01-19 18:34:07 As far as I know UK Navy were steam powered in WW1 & later but burnt crude oil instead of coal. This cut out the need for a global network of coal bunkering.  I think  serious marine diesels came much later than WW1 & never for battleships
9189 2018-01-19 18:34:02 Moved from Ft. Myers back to Va w/ military. Rep. Rooney wrong. Va Congress members and citizens have been attuned to offshore oil drilling issue for long time. Va Dem Congressmen, Dem gov, thus Va is punished. Gov Scott helped deliver a squeaker win for Trump. Quid pro quo. Ugh.
9190 2018-01-19 18:33:51 Chris K understands the mind of both the anti-Trump left as well as Trumps supporters; ‘abusive’ and ‘cruel’ a bit strong.

9206 2018-01-19 18:32:14 This man gonna have the nerve to ask me to change his oil like he wasn’t driving around all morning that shit hot as fuck rn. Even when I worked at Mazda I’d wait at least 30 minutes gmfu

9212 2018-01-19 18:31:57 I just made the most resourceful and delicious breakfast: heated up last nights quinoa and vegan ground ‘beef’, added “Soyrizo” and turmeric for color/taste. Grilled some naan with olive oil. It’s like India in California. #vegan
9213 2018-01-19 18:31:55 i asked the guy at the gas station if he could check my oil for me and he told me to get out of the car and then taught me everything about whats under the hood of my car. i’m basically a mechanic now.
9214 2018-01-19 18:31:41 i am a Canadian and very pro Trump and the oil
story is great but remember the shale oil in
New York is around a massive fresh water body
serving the drinking water for the State so do your
homework there is a good reason for the fracking
ban ,the people effected should decide.
9215 2018-01-19 18:31:40 The same coal plants power the production process for ICE cars, and also diesel powers the boats that move the oil....
9216 2018-01-19 18:31:35 
9217 2018-01-19 18:31:26 So this move to open up the offshore leases to exploration has nothing to do with meeting domestic energy needs (we already have a glut of oil and natural gas as evidenced by the low crude and gas prices) but has everything to do with propping up oil stock prices and dividends.
9218 2018-01-19 18:31:10 I will pay someone to take my car to get an oil change

9248 2018-01-19 18:27:51 Oil stocks are valued based on “proven reserves”. In order to show growth in stock value, oil companies must continually increase their proven reserves while at the same time reducing these reserves through production. This is why they push for access to the offshore assets
9249 2018-01-19 18:27:43 What’s the point of being created by Oil in 08 when you shit urselves over wages in 2018 ???

9255 2018-01-19 18:27:04 I reckon Sanchez chose United’s £500K a week because it’s clean, legitimate money earned organically- whereas City’s £200K per week is  obvs dirty oil money.
9256 2018-01-19 18:27:04 Hey Delta Oil & Gas thanks for the follow!
9257 2018-01-19 18:26:53 Yes, the great negotiator really is nothing more then a puppet.
Just depends whose hand is pulling the strings: Russia, big oil, Immigration hard liners.
 He is spineless.

9261 2018-01-19 18:26:10 Does your base really believe the snake oil you're selling?
9262 2018-01-19 18:26:05 I tried the oregano oil and it is disgusting.
9263 2018-01-19 18:26:01 Yea it’s basically just mayo with garlic and with olive oil instead of canola
9264 2018-01-19 18:25:58 Are the offshore oil Riggs ok?
9265 2018-01-19 18:25:55 wait a minute...i bet this has to do with that tanker that exploded. May have used oil slick or smoke screen.
9266 2018-01-19 18:25:21 Ok, just keep and eye out for any diesel in the oil, as they have a habit of doing the injector seats seals, and also the valve springs start to break. People say they actually go better after a rebuild.
9267 2018-01-19 18:25:20 I have the stress relief lotion, body wash, hand sanitizer, diffuser oil, and car scent but THEY ARE NOT WORKING

9269 2018-01-19 18:25:00 Scotland being independent has fuck all to do with England.. For the life of me I've no idea why they are so fucking obsessed! Oil maybe? Trident? Energy? Salmon? Hey our Gin and Vodka are fecking global! Maybe it's our charm?! No pretty sure it's the money we generate.

9272 2018-01-19 18:24:52 This morning I was getting my oil changed and I read through 3 chapters while listening to the Revelations soundtrack. It worked out nicely since some of the tracks followed story beats with what was going on.

9280 2018-01-19 18:23:42 My skin is hopeless, no matter how I moisturize it, it gets dry even in summer. I combine Nivea for dry skin with tissue oil but still.....
9281 2018-01-19 18:23:34 Do you have the latest version of AdCap on your device? Do you have at least 5 Oil Rigs on Earth?
9282 2018-01-19 18:23:28 I've said it once and I'm saying it again but I think its about time you had your own TV show.What you do is truely outstanding and up there with what I see other top chefs/cooks do.

9286 2018-01-19 18:22:42 The market is speaking, both on oil and LNG.  But are our politicians listening?  I own VLO shares (refining) and FRO shares (oil shipping.) One's up 50% from where I bought and one's down 40%.  We need to refine for our own use, not ship.

9311 2018-01-19 18:19:32 Right.

9313 2018-01-19 18:19:22 I guess leaking oil is losing half a lb crew among others on defense at times and still carrying a top defense, and being able to adjust to a new qb and still win a championship? I'll take a leaking oil team with that much heart every season

- Use Proraso Red solid shaving soap and a brush, or a high quality foam.
- Do it in the shower.
- Coconut oil as an post-shave moisturiser.

9358 2018-01-19 18:14:10 lmao girl, right here! but your hair will be fine it just needs time and TLC. moisture, moisture, moisture! deep condition, bathe in a good leave in and moisturizing oil (avoid coconut tho because it has quite a bit of protein) and you'll rebound soon enough.

9369 2018-01-19 18:13:26 EROEI describes an economic constraint insofar as gas & oil products are needed to extact future oil. Energy is the only objective cost: all else is demand. But energy  economics is indeed an (absolute) constraint

9378 2018-01-19 18:12:43 I did some quick research on the area offshore where the feds want to drill for oil. In the1960s, a survey was done that showed there wasn't much oil out there. There's a subduction zone out there creating new landscape on the ocean floor, every day! It's not feasible!
9379 2018-01-19 18:12:34 So many snake oil salesmen in this business
9380 2018-01-19 18:12:24 My husband’s head flows with oil and his garment remains white! By the Lord, we have put ten thousand to flight! We have done mighty things and executed great feats in righteousness, ours is a formidable union that is built to last.
9381 2018-01-19 18:12:24 u can spray lemon essential oil on the mat to try and keep em away.. also lavender i think as well they dont like.. it kind of worked for me when we lived in highland park lol
9382 2018-01-19 18:12:19 Ok you guys. Why didnt yall tell me tea tree oil would be the cure to my face after all of these years ? My skin lately is on 
9383 2018-01-19 18:12:13 How do you know? Do you drive to Toledo, Sandusky, Findlay? That adds up. Usually I go over the mileage for a oil change. I didn't realize you drove my car.
9384 2018-01-19 18:12:08 Ephor oil bites her sips.
9385 2018-01-19 18:12:07 And this is why "we" are willing to sacrifice the health and beauty of this land for what in our children's lifetime  will be as obsolete as whale oil?  Thanks, but no thanks.
9386 2018-01-19 18:11:44 This is a man-made disaster. Greed from the leadership in Sudan is causing immense suffering in this oil rich country.
9387 2018-01-19 18:11:38 If so, put that massive oil derrick platform just opposite of Mar-a-Lago 
9388 2018-01-19 18:11:32 I disagree with the premise of the article. While Norway may have won a "geographical lottery", how the country chose to invest and protect the economy from overheating (as opposed to other other oil states which have not) deserves credit, not finger pointing and condemnation.
9389 2018-01-19 18:11:24 Actually, they have to pay for their policies. But thank you for helping out.  Lol. If they lived in Norway, 45s favorite country, health care is provided to all by the oil they trade.
9390 2018-01-19 18:11:14 I know because oil but ME LIKE THE KEROSENE OIL SIR!
9391 2018-01-19 18:10:57 Saw that. I was thinking exporter; which is maybe more apt to your USD vs oil suggestion?
9392 2018-01-19 18:10:54 The evidence is somewhat stacked against you. It’s very sad. Keep digging your hole - you might hit oil one day.
9393 2018-01-19 18:10:40 I hate recipes where they're like "Five ingredients only!" and it's got like five ingredients excluding water, salt, oil, etc...

That's not five ingredients...
9394 2018-01-19 18:10:33 Jesse accidentally gave me Coconut oil and thought it was shampoo while we were showering in the locker rooms and now my hair is all oily and weird 
9395 2018-01-19 18:10:25 the oil actually worse than cu- nvm

9398 2018-01-19 18:10:03 How long til oil is not only traded in USD but also RMB or EUR or whatever. That’s the day the credit card will come due. It’s not that far away with the ad naseum speed at which we continue to just print dollars. That’s also the day you want to be holding the crypto.
9399 2018-01-19 18:09:57 Hi boo. Sounds weird but have you ever tried castor oil? Look up home remedies to figure out the mixture amounts- it works!!!

9401 2018-01-19 18:09:49 The Gaza conflict resulted from Palestinian actions. Israel may not have acted in good faith, but they're a sovereign democracy which has to balance the rights of Palestinians with the Palestinian tendency to murder civilian Israelis. Israel is not an oppressive regime.

9403 2018-01-19 18:09:46 great list! the only change I'd suggest is buying Tide Pods before getting the oil changed. available Tide Pods will run out before Bitcoin.
9404 2018-01-19 18:09:39 So today is #NationalPopcornDay? That's cool, but Everyday is Popcorn Day for me! lol Popcorn is my addiction! Air Popped, with Pink Himalayan Salt and Coconut Oil! Tastes so yummy!

9411 2018-01-19 18:08:38 I agree. I'm am pro-medical marijuana. I want to see more studies done on children with the CBD oil. There seems to be some real promise with that. As someone with chronic pain, I would like an alternative to the 5 different meds I take to deal with the different types of pain.
9412 2018-01-19 18:08:36 I agree! Also he really needs to cut back on the oil.

9446 2018-01-19 18:04:25 well, my personal take on that is everybody just mind their own - grow your own, feed your own, build your own. But I don't know many Americans who would willingly give up stuff made in China or not pitch a fit if an oil well were someplace they don't want it.
9447 2018-01-19 18:04:21 The only really safe solution to the problem of oil pollution is not to ship oil on -or for that matter under -the sea.  Until we have developed a fuel as convenient and cheap however, that is in practical terms no solution.   We have instead to look for palliatives;

9464 2018-01-19 18:02:43 the value of the dollar (demand for this particular paper) comes from the fact that most desirable products (oil being absolute key since it's paramount to any economy) are priced in it as well as the fact you need to buy USD to pay taxes (US corps and citizens)

9491 2018-01-19 18:00:24 Is cattle colony in APC manifesto? Nigerians didn't vote to have these colonies. Isn't cattle-rearing a private business? Niger deltans haven't been provided farm land in the north after their farm lands were polluted by oil.
9492 2018-01-19 18:00:18 An engaging read.  I will share an anecdote about land speculation in the coffee industry.  Of course, climate change is relevant to plantation profitability.  A Republican colleague would hear none of it and conjectured Al Gore conspires to destroy the oil industry.
9493 2018-01-19 18:00:15 Autoshops swear they always full. Shut yo ass up. You're not booked and it won't take you an hour and a half to do my oil change.
9494 2018-01-19 18:00:15 Used to use red hermatite for crankcases occasionally silver on dodgy gaskets cos non setting. Staple diet in hull used to be orange for everything Inc crankcases blocked oil pumps

9496 2018-01-19 18:00:01 CHINA: Oil spill in the East China Sea that was caused by an Iranian tanker is now the size of Paris.
9497 2018-01-19 17:59:55 News: If the Prince of Wales and future King of England has not found a solution for hair loss/hair growth (given each folical could be massaged with truffle oil, feed caviar and sung a live opera twice daily) one very likely does not exist.
9498 2018-01-19 17:59:51 If they own everything and are everywhere, that isn’t ever going to work. You should probably not allow them to do that. You should go after their banks and their weapons. You can do that by stopping your consumption, working less. Stop driving, start to walk everyplace. Off oil.
9499 2018-01-19 17:59:37 You guys have no oil I guess, but we are alomst the richest country in the world and we still have some poor people, not just underpaid, they have only one meal a day.

9501 2018-01-19 17:59:00 Hi @cornicabra10 - oh we love olive oil, so many different flavours to discover.
9502 2018-01-19 17:59:00 Janessa really said “my car won’t turn in so it needs oil” this dumb bitch 
9503 2018-01-19 17:58:55 Another productive day. Set my alarm to wake up a couple of hours before if usually get up for work.

Made the first mochi scarf, level swords, completely cleaned out my car, added oil & windshield washer fluid to car.

Now I have time for 1 more episode of Binan Koukou

9512 2018-01-19 17:58:01 Nice, and if you think paying all the costs and having no say in the EU is popular then think again. There are many good things about Norway and none of it has anything to do with the EU but a lot to do with oil
9513 2018-01-19 17:57:49 So I tried the Palmer’s Coconut Oil Conditioner because it doesn’t have any sulfates and claims it’s sustainably sourced.... but duuude the smell is SO potent, I nearly puked in the shower! It’s all I can smell now. 
9514 2018-01-19 17:57:45 Doesn’t undermine the idea though.  We too are an oil producer.

9516 2018-01-19 17:57:38 for a makeup remove i use coconut oil that can be found at any grocery store...this decomposes the makeup n then i wash my face twice to clear the oil then clean my skin.....

9518 2018-01-19 17:57:35 mom told me changing my oil would be like $30 and it's like $75, im not okay
9519 2018-01-19 17:57:31 I clean my face with black soap, witch hazel and coconut oil it works so good y’all
9520 2018-01-19 17:57:29 all of it that i’ve seen has coconut oil in it 
9521 2018-01-19 17:57:20 Severe lack of balance among many FSG out opinions. It’s as if there are multiple oil tycoons out there waiting to buy us. LFC was offered to them and they all declined.
9522 2018-01-19 17:57:18 Note to self. Stop fucking touching/rubbing the face while wearing the still oil filled gloves from mechanic job. 2nd time I had to wash my face from black dirt marks all over forehead and nose lol
9523 2018-01-19 17:57:04 Don't worry Sir; just let Oil sustain at these levels for a few months and real interest rates would come down themselves! Yes, I do agree though, that we need to give the organizations run by the Adanis and Ambanis some more tax breaks, because trickle down works!

9622 2018-01-19 17:45:47 Many thanks n.n and a past pun from my voluminous archive! What do elderly magic users apply before they use somatic spells? Castor Oil.
9623 2018-01-19 17:45:26 Too bad I won't be there I would like to ask why it's ok for a Canadian  company to have an oil spill in America
9624 2018-01-19 17:45:11 I came home early  to hear our bed creaking & squeezing loudly. Upstairs I caught my wife & best friend having sex. I don't know what to do. Should I oil the springs or trade it in for a new one?
9625 2018-01-19 17:44:55 I like that you're a steminist bc I'm an educator.I certainly would bow to your expertise but I still believe coal,gas & oil are not the way to go esp if it means opening up our natl parks to drilling under a deregulated system.I still vote for retraining coal miners& renewables
9626 2018-01-19 17:44:46 In love this little story i get castor oil for worldbuilding omg yeah it changed my heart!!!!! FLOWERS BY IN LOVE WITH A
9627 2018-01-19 17:44:43 I need to get an oil change and my tires rotated. See if I had a boyfriend I wouldn’t have to worry about this.

9639 2018-01-19 17:43:19 This man is the biggest snake oil salesman in history. Quoting the Bible. What if Stormy had become pregnant while in an adulterous relationship with Doofus? How embarassing.

This is a huge victory for America!!!!!
9646 2018-01-19 17:42:46 Why won't fake news like the sun times tell us why we are currently bombing 8 countries? And how drug companies, banks, oil companies , and big banks buy all the politicians in Washington?  Then pass bills that benefit them and screw over the working class people.
9647 2018-01-19 17:42:30 THEY HAVE FOUND OIL IN MUMBAI !!

9666 2018-01-19 17:40:04 Here’s an idea why don’t you put an oil pipeline through the National Parks you hypocrites just so you can make money through them
9667 2018-01-19 17:40:00 Because science is political and huge amounts of money depend on it. In fact, so much money sits in oil that an entire political party is willing to lie and deny about Clinate Change to protect that money.

9672 2018-01-19 17:39:28 America was always superior to the Middle East oil countries. The US politicians have allowed this domination by Arab leadership. Why? Because our past political leaders have profited handsomely. Congress is the lowest form of human existence.

9677 2018-01-19 17:38:48 I’m confused. Pro life only before birth but they don’t want universal healthcare for all life. The value money and oil over climate change when disasters cause death. They don’t value the lives of the dreamers and they sure don’t value the lives of Democrats

9680 2018-01-19 17:38:12 Same here,the good influencers are powerful branding tools but there are a lot of snake oil ones who offer little more than exposure.

9690 2018-01-19 17:36:32 Some red tape is needed to keep greedy companies and organizations from profiting at the expense of human well being. Do you think Big Pharmacy would do the testing required if feet not held to the fire. Do you think oil companies would protect our oceans?
9691 2018-01-19 17:36:31 last time it was handling the rental. this time it’s getting an oil change. 
9692 2018-01-19 17:36:25 NAFTA is profitable in the US if we exclude oil, so withdrawal from them would cost them thousands of jobs. What a great way for Mr. Trump to lose face by demonstrating that these fallback policies give exactly the opposite effect to these claims.

9721 2018-01-19 17:33:04 I’m so confused. They say pro life before birth but then they don’t want universal healthcare to take care and value life. They want to put more people in jail. They want to drill oil for money even if more die from climate disasters!
9722 2018-01-19 17:32:57 Also what about Turkey literally supporting ISIS by buying their oil and selling them weapons and equipment. Even fucking printing ISIS currency! Do you think people forgot about that?
9723 2018-01-19 17:32:55 Mostly hydration. There’s one w/ Vitamin C Rose Oil for brightening and tightening too. I’ll update you when I try it.

9741 2018-01-19 17:30:12 Nope. It doesn’t peel away that well. It’s a odd substance. Like sometimes an entire nail of polish will pop off like a press-on, other times it won’t come off unless you soak your nail bed with cuticle oil.
9742 2018-01-19 17:30:02 Haha. No. Not Nigeria. Nigeria has a lot of Oil, and smart ladies and gentlemen. The Raw materials largely come from Africa- all of it! The States benefits from relations with every #shithole , sometimes unfairly through manipulation. But whatever the case, USA needs Africa.

9749 2018-01-19 17:28:53 Agree. By 2022 the Tesla Gigafactories for electric batteries will be up and running. Where will the price of oil be by 2026?

9763 2018-01-19 17:26:55 I don’t have any strength to go get an oil change where is my bf
9764 2018-01-19 17:26:16 use tea tree oil!
9765 2018-01-19 17:26:11 You don't know me Scott and not sure you will read this but to aid your health try blitzing raw green veg, Kale Broccoli, Spring cabbage etc in a blender & drink it, lot of info on anticarcinogens in them also if in doubt Cannabis Oil. I know I would, good luck mate. All the best
9766 2018-01-19 17:25:48 It's like peeing in the women's bathroom AND the men's too.
9767 2018-01-19 17:25:37 Yes it’s unfortunate that Prince William has lost his hair but bloody hell, wind your necks in! You’re hardly a bunch of oil paintings yourselves.
9768 2018-01-19 17:25:24 In the same country where Buhari wasted $3billion prospecting for oil where it already had been established there was none, we needed a $1b to come out of recession?
9769 2018-01-19 17:25:20 In 1939-41, UK fought Germany alone - while USSR was allied with Germany and supplying it with oil and other war materials. Nats don’t know that.
9770 2018-01-19 17:25:18 No but deadass jojoba oil is that girl & y’all need to add it to your skin routine
9771 2018-01-19 17:25:06 As someone in the industry, I can say that (without even looking at the chart) that oil price is fixing the decline to the low-to-mid 60s. reason why price pumped was because EIA revised their demand outlook & caused a bit of overspeculation.

9773 2018-01-19 17:24:34 We're at Buffalo wild wings at 9:30am because my car needed an oil change and we're nocturnal.

Why is daylight, Bailey?
9774 2018-01-19 17:24:32 Why frack the place up with earthquakes downtown when you can enjoy growing good hemp oil fields with science & engineering students at farms?
9775 2018-01-19 17:24:25 A pint of fruit salad or as the song goes cod liver oil and the orange juice
9776 2018-01-19 17:24:19 I love the big white down along with little purple. Such beauty and elegance. The path for bears is glorious!

9778 2018-01-19 17:24:03 Paul Cicio of Industrial Consumers of America, comes out strong against LNG export bill. Tells lawmakers they can either vote with the big oil and gas companies, or their communities and businesses who want cheap energy
9779 2018-01-19 17:23:42 I work in a part of So Cal that is an oil field on a fault zone, with a city built on top of it.  Construction has to negotiate between all of those factors.  It's really fascinating (when not totally frustrating).  Our Building Inspector is also our Oil Field Svcs Coordinator.
9780 2018-01-19 17:23:39 Smart people and those that read Bill Browder's book know in fact its the Russians along with the Republicans.  Putin is loving this, along with the oil industry.
9781 2018-01-19 17:23:37 I never said anything about independence. But the UK gov just announced new gas and oil finds plus the extentions to pre existing fields. But I agree with you basing an economy solely on that would be foolish. ie 2016 when the tanking of oil price slashed a whole 0.6% of gdp
9782 2018-01-19 17:23:31 MALago staff: “Hi! Welcome to the Southern White House. Would you like to sit with the Russian or Syrian Oil Delegations?

9791 2018-01-19 17:22:22 Rap is funny. Dudes are homoerotic and homophobic at the same time. "50 Cent keeps my name his mouth... I think he'd rather my dick in his mouth." - Ja Rule 

That's right, fellas, oil it up.

9793 2018-01-19 17:22:13 Sam Levine's Sax covers on Spotify are everything--so pure and otherworldly. Nothing beats listening to them with the scent of lavender (or green tea) essence oil calming me from head to toe before bedtime. Ahhh life! 

Yup, tita level: 999
9794 2018-01-19 17:22:12 I had a 61 chevy truck 6 banger that I used filtered oil !!  Smoked pretty bad when it was full of oil. Lol
9795 2018-01-19 17:22:10 @mhunterreynolds We feel you there! Well we wanted to say we're here for you if you ever need a car wash or oil change :)

9798 2018-01-19 17:21:44 Hi, I'm not an expert, I will ask our maintenance guys and get back to you. I have seen they sweep off what they can and then use a gritty, absorbent powder which soaks up the oil and makes the surface gritty to stop tyres slipping. I will check! Have good weekend
9799 2018-01-19 17:21:23 Looks like even the big oil corps are sliding into the cannabis production field now. Funny shit

Was it not Jonathan government that is at the centre of Malabu oil deal ?
An Italian court has indaict  him and many member of his government for collecting bribe from Foreign motivational ...can vote 4 such person agin
9803 2018-01-19 17:20:40 Iraq attacked Iran over oil conquests and a MILLION MUSLIMS KILLED EACH OTHER, in those TURF WARS! And in EVERY OIL DOMINANT COUNTRY, the ROBBED THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS! 
To add insult to injury, they continued BLAMING THE VICTIMS! Like stoning rape victims to death.
9804 2018-01-19 17:20:38 You can’t increase any Gov Tax without Provincial Income AKA Oil Exports. Kind of ironic isn’t it? 
The SJW/Progressive/Regressive Diper Gov realizes eventually taxpayers can only handle so many tax increases. So you need an income stream. Just happens to be a Carb Spewing 1 LOL
9805 2018-01-19 17:20:33 Yes, wars create jobs, but main prize is ensuring that resource rich countries price their oil etc in USD so that they accept paper for real wealth (energy, minerals etc) as well as destroying any competition for such resources from those who refuse USD seigniorage (like Russia)
9806 2018-01-19 17:20:32 Clever stuff.
9807 2018-01-19 17:20:24 Snow?!  Lucky!  So, snow might be in our area next week?   Or yourselves?  Do please come by and pay a visit!
9808 2018-01-19 17:20:13 Socialism has failed in every country that adopted it. They are Shzz Holes. The most recent one to crumble is Venezuela which has the world's largest oil reserves. The Government which Bernie Sanders and Liberals like Sean Penn love has their Citizens eating from garbage dumps.

9812 2018-01-19 17:19:53 Ye, believe we use a powder which soaks up the oil and is gritty so stops tyres slipping. Have good weekend!
9813 2018-01-19 17:19:45 is this different then oil cartridges?
9814 2018-01-19 17:19:44 Trump is determined to destroy the land and monuments with his non-stop oil drilling permits. Yesterday he signed a bill to kill bear and wolf cubs in Alaska. Besides the evil of killing entire animal families he is killing future food supply for the people living there. Resist.
9815 2018-01-19 17:19:42 Hi Ed
Do you have an oil supply curve for the Shale formations in the US?
I'm teaching an oil markets course this semester in the past I've used one of your curves from an FT article.

9824 2018-01-19 17:18:47 So you blame Israel,  even though your article says nothing about Israel.   Isis is emulating the first 2 caliphs- can't believe there were any Christians &Jews left I  areas.... according to the article this sect spread due to oil.   So are you saying Muslims are that weak?

9831 2018-01-19 17:17:18 @RealDonad_Trump WE LOVE RENEWABLE ENERGY. Save our oil and coal reserves for future military planning. @jeffsessions The Legal Marijuana industry employs nearly 7 times more Americans than the coal industry. Plus, weed doesn’t harm people or the environment. EVOLVE!!!
9832 2018-01-19 17:16:57 2/2 the replacement came in form of services, military equipment sales (2% NATO target) then increasingly degenerated into blackmailing Saudis to price their oil in USD (petrodollars) and other abusive seigniorage. You can't maintain confidence once the IOUs are in trillions
9833 2018-01-19 17:16:54 snack oil sounds delicious tho

9837 2018-01-19 17:16:31 As W.Bush created republican right wing ISIS with he's wars on the wrong Country as Sudia Arbia did 9/11 as the bombers all but 3 came from Saudi Arabia and the leaders family was oil man W.Bushes best friends with the Bin Ladin family as a lot of oil money exchanged between them
9838 2018-01-19 17:16:16 Oil output highest in history, A limited supply resource, history tells us this a recipe for disaster. Let’s all celebrate this good news! We don’t need to develop expensive alternatives energy sources, why spend the money and focus.....
9839 2018-01-19 17:16:11 ....BTW not against 'Big Wind' or 'Big Car'  personally
THo' treating *Big Oil as evil lobby* but willful blindness in ignoring  BigCorps that lobby for wind/subsidies or EV,because THIS lobby is on *MY side* is what then creates the recurring societal panic attacks like 'Diesel'
9840 2018-01-19 17:16:08 Oil change done on the truck. Need the front brakes replace soon.
9841 2018-01-19 17:15:31 And NOBODY has been more “SCARRED” than our military families. Once oil was discovered, the entire Middle East lost its mind! Iran is a great example of this. Thousands of years of a royal family and oil ousted them. The Ayatollah took over and never stopped the greed.
9842 2018-01-19 17:15:29 I’m tryna get a oil change

9847 2018-01-19 17:14:56 Wow, that's crazy! In a town where you can get your oil changed at any time of night, I'd think 24 hr urgent care would be all over. And accepting casino chips as payment! #HITsm
9848 2018-01-19 17:14:49 it doesn't matter how long you go to school or what courses you take. Garbage pseudoscience is garbage pseudoscience and naturopaths /homeopathy has no basis in science or reality. Stop peddling snake oil to unsuspecting people.
9849 2018-01-19 17:14:48 Turns out Walmart put the wrong oil for my car that’s why my engine light went off. I had to go to my car dealership to fix the problem. I hate Walmart lmao $50 wasted I want my money back.
9850 2018-01-19 17:14:43 Bla bla, oil, bla bla, eu right?!Manely on every etiket of biostuf in EU sadly wich makes ppl like; "Uhm,really?Yeah...nope!"They use multiple symbols on the etiket to make shure you know it is bio.

9865 2018-01-19 17:13:04 RIL earned $11.6 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel in October-December as against a gross refining margin (GRM) of $10.8 in the same period last year. It, however, is lower than $12 recorded in the July-September quarter of the current fiscal. 2/3
9866 2018-01-19 17:13:01 @WendyWilliams I got beef with the agency that flew a oil commercial film crew on a helicopter over my head while I was NOT in front of trace alternates fueless dodge Dakota truck. Attempt at video meme
9867 2018-01-19 17:12:35 1/2 Yes, confidence that the issuers of those IOUs can back them, ie confidence they will be accepted in exchange for other goods (US lawyers fees, Saudi Arabia oil, etc). US used to have plenty of gold and big manufacturing base to back those IOUs. This has largely evaporated
9868 2018-01-19 17:12:32 BJP did nationwide campaign against the petrol price hike when UPA was in power. Your party promised oil price will be reduced under your rule. What happened now? Agreeing you too a failure to bring down hike
9869 2018-01-19 17:12:27 Economist John Mitchell: Seattle's upturn is "old but not dead." There is no inherit requirement they have to end in 10 years. How do they end? Imbalance, policy shocks or changes, oil shocks. #PSBJOutlook
9870 2018-01-19 17:12:25 Haha, nah. Not a Pringle in sight. Last thing I ate was paella. Beard oil smelling of Chorizo would’ve been worse to be fair.

9872 2018-01-19 17:11:57 yes Greg, i was back in yesterday
but dont see $dwt to break 12 before expiration

watch:  $oil below 63 = selling to accelerate
9873 2018-01-19 17:11:52 What’s your point?  The NFL will survive. People get pissed off for a moment and don’t even know why. And then they keep watching. Remember people used to boycott big oil companies on a “Wednesday” because of prices.  Then they bought the gas on Thursday instead.
9874 2018-01-19 17:11:45 Who cares what they spend . They generate their own cash by own sales , unlike city who use oil money to buy their players !!! Typical jealousy against Utd!!!

9900 2018-01-19 17:09:59 there's a really good documentary from the bbc in 3 parts that covers this called "Planet Oil"  well worth watching
9901 2018-01-19 17:09:46 Sesame baguette, olive oil, coffee.
9902 2018-01-19 17:09:39 okay this is the ACTUAL easiest way to give eel pills: coat them with oil first.
9903 2018-01-19 17:09:31 Ah. Didn't know about your oil billionaire past.
9904 2018-01-19 17:09:26 You do realize the uses of crude oil, right. Less than 50% of crude oil gets converted to gasoline/fuel. Probably the pants you are wearing right now is from oil, not mentioning 5999 other things.
9905 2018-01-19 17:09:22 Amazed it’s taken so long to sort. The waterfowl conservation area is just down the river - with all the oil floating right into it!! I can see other people have been tweeting too......
9906 2018-01-19 17:09:16 I think you meant to say the lack of coal and oil is real**
9907 2018-01-19 17:09:11 Bro why modi didi not add GST in oil and wine??!! Give me answer
9908 2018-01-19 17:08:57 But here, the focus is just limited to oil oil oil in and the unending excuses and blames. The potentials of Nigeria are greater than oil if and only we are genuinely concerned at Leadership level without political sentiments. The brains are here.
9909 2018-01-19 17:08:52 took an oil of oregano supplement and now my mouth vaguely tastes like the condiment station at a pizza place

9918 2018-01-19 17:07:30 I think I topped off my car with the wrong oil  I don’t think the engine is supposed to whistle.
9919 2018-01-19 17:07:28 I wonder what it feels like to live in such luxury! Sigh,  and someone else washing my salty windshield and topping off my oil.. swoon

9928 2018-01-19 17:06:41 I imagine that SoCalGas has access to the files from the Getty Oil days, and can easily obtain fracking info from the originating suppliers of the gas they're buying to store in Aliso.  The gas co. lawyers don't want that info to get into the hands of its opposition lawyers.
9929 2018-01-19 17:06:36 OIL DIFF: 5.42 -> 5.43
9930 2018-01-19 17:06:30 Have U noticed higher GAS prices? I have. Under Obama, oil was $40-45 a barrel. Now under Trump its $60-65. We're almost no.1 in oil production, the world is awash in oil yet we r paying more. WHY TRUMP? After higher gas prices,HEALTHCARE prices, whats left of ur big tax break?
9931 2018-01-19 17:06:18 I want the rice and stew my mom makes where the stew is just oil with a lil tomato sauce in it
9932 2018-01-19 17:06:08 Iran being part of OPEC will limit its production regardless of the temporary production cut. Oil reserves is irrelevant. Venezuela has by far the largest oil reserves and they only produce 2.2 million bbl/day
9933 2018-01-19 17:06:02 I want funding as well—how do you justify an unnecessary tax cut and ask for funds? Where do you stand on the oil companies being relieved of a fee/tax that funds oil spill cleanups? Those pesky, costly  regulations that oil companies were burdened with...?
9934 2018-01-19 17:05:52 … Our rangers and volunteers have been carrying out regular patrols to pick up any palm oil they see, but we’re reminding all dog walkers to be vigilant and keep close control of their dogs when walking along the beach. We hope this helps. (3/3)
9935 2018-01-19 17:05:43 ....depends on who is in charge of the EPA, I guess. If Pruitt was a JUST a former state attorney general, I imagine they would pursue rigorously. But Pruitt is an OIL  state attorney general. Duty vs Constituents....guess who always wins????
9936 2018-01-19 17:05:39 You have mucus in your bronchioles.Same shit happens with asthma. You need a bronchodilator to open your bronchioles more. If you know anyone with an inhaler take 2 puffs of that. CBD oil in a vape is great for bronchodilation. Inhalers are your best bet tho sir for that dilation
9937 2018-01-19 17:05:39 Well everyone is in love with Pep so they won't. Oil money feeds City and Chelsea. And PSG. But the minute a self sustainable club spends money to compete there is outrage and cries of 'all about the money'. Hypocrisy all over the place!
9938 2018-01-19 17:05:33 Hello Grace, thanks for getting in touch with us, and we’re sorry to hear this. We can confirm that we have signs out at all major access points to the beach, including our car parks, warning visitors about the palm oil. These signs are checked regularly… (1/3)
9939 2018-01-19 17:05:30 Ok, real talk:

My Dad grew up poor in the Bronx, and, given that he didn't have many opportunities, moved to Louisiana to work on the oil rigs. While there he (22) met my Mom (15), who grew up very poor in the swamps of Louisiana. My Mom chose to tell my Dad she was 18, and by
9940 2018-01-19 17:05:27 Meanwhile in D.C. Senate Democrats are contending that a Trump official this morning in a hearing contradicted the position that Florida is "off the table" when it comes to oil drilling. Still waiting to see the actual quotes.
9941 2018-01-19 17:05:12 I knew karma was real when fish oil was buy one get one free. I was doin way too much nice shit for nothing but my blessing came large and in charge.
9942 2018-01-19 17:05:07 Ahh, it was some feta cheese in olive oil sauce with dipping bread, an order of sweet french soup (like french onion, but without the cheese), and a non-meat burger!

Overall I feel the beer matched up well with the burger and the appetizer, but not in a 'bar food' kind of sense!

9949 2018-01-19 17:03:54 Lol the US does not want to overthrow OPEC, we only want to reduce its power and our dependence on foreign oil. Even when the sanctions are removed, Iran will still not outproduce the US that’s my point.

9960 2018-01-19 17:02:27 You still believe those delusions? You peddled the lie while Cuban troops remained in Angola protecting American Oil Installations from your puppet Savimbi. You attacked weak countries like Zambia where the only "communist" was British Queen Worshipping Kenneth Kaunda
9961 2018-01-19 17:02:18 As a Canian, I’m suddenly feeling an incredible connection with history—somewhere in Austria, sometime in the ‘30s an older Austrian woman wondered: “But, is he a threat to us? Surely not.”
Trump about Iraq: “Take the oil.”
Trump about Canada: “Take the water… and minerals.”
