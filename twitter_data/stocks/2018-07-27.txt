4 2018-07-29 23:53:54 Yes. Why care about others with less money that you? Well except for the fact that they buy the product the company you work for sells. So if they have no money, you have no money. And I get it. I buy and sell stocks. I understand how appealing the bottom line is.

41 2018-07-29 23:40:13 @PhilakoneCrypto is there a reason you don't trade stocks? Or have you ever? Can you recommend a good simulated program to learn to trade stocks. Thanks
42 2018-07-29 23:38:28 From an efficient markets pov, $TSLA has got to be one of the all time most researched stocks.  Yet implied volatility is 65% which basically says there are surprises yet to come.
43 2018-07-29 23:38:15 Exactly big board stocks not manipulated shit
44 2018-07-29 23:38:10 I’m looking for long term success stories of dividend investing in Canadian stocks. If you know of anything please let me know. This would be particularly interesting if it related to Canadian Bank stocks.
45 2018-07-29 23:37:27 I say we all start a class action suit against twitter for violating our first amendment rights. Their stocks will plunge big time without us being here. Who do they think they’re??? BS 
46 2018-07-29 23:36:38 Only the highest IQ retail investors buy stocks like this.
47 2018-07-29 23:35:15 The best way to insulate yourself from the bankers pumping & dumping of the economy from stocks to interest rates to gold is to build a life off the grid starting with your home as a platform so you are standing on firm ground & can brace yourself from their machinations.
48 2018-07-29 23:34:39 I think I am just going to give hearts or likes and retweet stuff I think is important, and hopefully somehow someone will see it.  Twitter just got seriously boring, and I can understand why they have tanking stocks. You either believe in free speech or you don’t.

55 2018-07-29 23:26:46 From decision researcher Gerd Gigerenzer in "Risk Savvy":

(1) Save/invest 20% of your income, spend 80%.
(2) Invest equally in stocks, bonds, & real estate.
(3) In each category of (2), diversify as broadly as you can.
(4) Do your own thinking about money.

60 2018-07-29 23:21:55 On the watch list, there are 56 names within 10% of their 52w hi, a good number #stocks
61 2018-07-29 23:20:59 Boy, talk about a PR spin after stocks plummet bc of the Susan Rice and Obama hires. Think about that. They hire those liars, stocks plummet, them to make things better, they decide the best way to help their situation is appeal to the God fearing Americans out there.
62 2018-07-29 23:20:31 And how many years of overprices education do u need 4 all those jobs. 
Yes,4 those CEOs n other top 1%er. Their money goes either 2 artificially inflating their company's stocks through buy backs or like DeVos they buy yachts that carry smaller yachts and other over priced shit.
63 2018-07-29 23:20:03 Iv been telling myself I need to master one handful of the stocks you listed $AMZN $TSLA $NFLX $FB & $BABA are the main ones on my list. As a roughneck trying to get away from the industry, I'm going to focus on this type of strategy.
64 2018-07-29 23:17:08 Buy water stocks??
65 2018-07-29 23:15:54 Sounds like people need to start selling their UA stocks.
66 2018-07-29 23:15:08 Then maybe if the government would quit giving tax breaks to foreigners- make sure they become citzen- we wouldn't have all this either. The corporations laid people off after their break and then invested in stocks not people. The wealthy aren't helping and you're just puppetry

70 2018-07-29 23:11:51 Millions of people without healthcare. He’s helping his rich friends line there pockets with more money. Tax breaks to businesses that only buy there stocks back. Not hire people. What about all the companies that are coming back. Name some
71 2018-07-29 23:10:58 It’s not to late. Actually they’ve all dropped since I’ve bought. Still penny stocks so buy away and wait for Cheech and Chong to catch on.
72 2018-07-29 23:08:53 Nintendo is defaulting the demo at three stocks so I think competitive will follow suit
73 2018-07-29 23:08:26 Twitter should ban celebrities that practice hate speech on this platform if they don't shame on them. Stocks might continue to go down.
74 2018-07-29 23:06:29 How you find your price is a matter of debate but all stocks come at a cost according too market forces! Positioning yourself in a relative and informed strategy my not be profitable to the small trader but is accountable for the novice with insights too grow and develop a skill.
75 2018-07-29 23:06:28 I love how hmv actively stocks bts albums now like lmao that impact. BTS have truly hit the UK market hard.
76 2018-07-29 23:06:14 It looks like new stocks are available now 
77 2018-07-29 23:05:44 Back in highschool I told a friend one thing I could never see myself doing is trading stocks, now here I am a few years later doing a course on options & loving it. life's funny that way.
78 2018-07-29 23:04:01 We have had a sick bull run since the 2008 collapse. For the 1st time I am saying odds favor a market top certainly for 2018...if not many years. Last week FANG stocks got battered & 4.1% GDP got sold. Add to that rising rates & inv yield curve coming. Would be selling into pops
79 2018-07-29 23:03:30 How nice for you and Donald that your stocks increased in value. Now if you would just put more money into the hands of workers the economy would be better for workers too.
80 2018-07-29 23:03:16 Twitter lost 20% of it’s worth last week for Shadow Banning. I hope they lose another 50% this week. Would be terrible if some major conservatives bought the controlling interest in Twitter after the stocks drop...
81 2018-07-29 23:01:03 Isn’t your entire premise incorrect? Growth stocks have high PE ratings as they may have better long term prospects, whereas mature companies have lower PE ratings as they are less likely to perform. The stock market has if anything too strong a bias too the long term.
82 2018-07-29 23:00:10 J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière

85 2018-07-29 22:52:30 Are the plants you are working with now related to the ones you had last summer? E.g. did you store seeds and replant, or buy new stocks?
86 2018-07-29 22:52:03 The #FAANG #stocks drew some blood last week:

$FB -17%
$NFLX -1.5%
$AAPL -0.5%
$AMZN +0.3%
$GOOGL +4.6%

Is a rotation occurring? #Growth vs. #Value last week...Russell 1000 Value up 1.3% and Russell 1000 Growth down 0.6%...stay tuned.
87 2018-07-29 22:51:13 Keep working hard Lady!!! Happy to have you!
88 2018-07-29 22:50:54 You invest in the wrong stocks.
89 2018-07-29 22:50:09 Meme economy penny stocks.
90 2018-07-29 22:46:31 Exactly. You read my mind.

I started this work 4-5 years ago, trying to monitor all 4000 stocks everyday.  I ended up with information overload and got super confused with lots of noise.

So, I changed my strategy now. And I am more focused and clear. 
91 2018-07-29 22:45:52 That funny the NRA come out a year ago and said they wanted a ban on bump stocks. Bump stocks are a new thing that got approved to be legal by the Obama administration
92 2018-07-29 22:45:37 You're showing 2 Trump economy years to prove what? Also, stocks are tumbling. US news covers it daily.
93 2018-07-29 22:44:57 Know each player is a commodity that will go up and down in value like stocks on the market. You won’t always get it right, but try to acquire players in their growth phase and always sell a year too early than risk selling a year to late. And get “your guys”. Makes it more fun!
94 2018-07-29 22:44:57 Look into Canadian Pot stocks too
95 2018-07-29 22:44:01 Investing in stocks create no tangible wealth. In theory a billionaire could become broke if all wealth in stock and crashes. 
Rich do hire but have figured out they don't need to pay living wage. Govt (us) subsidies their workers via food stamps/ welfare/medicade

100 2018-07-29 22:37:26 Truth be told, Steffy don't deserve to run FC or have more stock than Eric. I hope everything she is planning backfires. She can't blame no one but herself. I hope that Bill remembers that he gave those stocks to Brooke on their wedding day. I hope she falls flat on her face.
101 2018-07-29 22:36:26 Could have something to do with US Steel's 7 new plants, Lincoln's poll numbers, and all those sweet Euros flowing in to buy US corn and soybeans (typically grown using pesticides and genetically modified seed stocks banned in Europe) – i.e., all products of the same imagination.
102 2018-07-29 22:35:31 Mangnuson Stevens act from 1970s allows for zero change in rebuild strategy/quota even with health stock and sustainable recource.  Needs to be re writer.  90 percent of US fish stocks are rebuilt.
103 2018-07-29 22:35:19 Name 3 stocks that trade over 10k? I'll wait...
104 2018-07-29 22:34:29 Based on the interview, I feel like you’re overreacting Brad. He says the NRA has been a roadblock to tighter background checks at gun shows and banning bump stocks. “I think it will save some lives,” he says. Doesn’t sound to me like he’s saying anything radical.

110 2018-07-29 22:31:50 Sure, if you have the intraday data feeds.

But, that's a lot of monitoring for all of the stocks

Pick a few earnings play, and concentrate on these

I do not monitor stock intraday

I just monitor the index ETFs that I post everyday, SPY SPX VIX VXX QQQ IWM, keeping me busy

113 2018-07-29 22:29:34 The only ones profiting from American companies manufacturing in Mexico are the companies and their stock holders and the Mexican government and the drug cartels.

114 2018-07-29 22:28:04 Walk way from Twitter and their stocks will continue to tank... Trump can buy it up :)
115 2018-07-29 22:26:16 Almost every economic indicator is up including consumer confidence. Anyone with a 401K, retirement plan, or stocks is loving life. Every scenario can have positive or negative points. You could double my taxes tomorrow and it won’t put another penny in your hand that’s out.
116 2018-07-29 22:25:20 2/ Saying "Bitcoin's value is equal to the amount next person is willing to pay" is outright wrong and illogical. Why are "those" people not willing to pay 200k for Gold or Oil? Think.

There is some value in Bitcoin which other things such as Gold, Oil, stocks etc. lack.
117 2018-07-29 22:24:43 I don't see how it's that important, I don't think it's misleading, when things like this happens I look at the stocks to see if counted, I did that as well for that fight as well, players don't need to have all chewd down like babys for them to understand when you die or not.
118 2018-07-29 22:24:03 Naked in the stocks for a week in one of our empty High Streets should deter them from doing it again ?

120 2018-07-29 22:21:22 Stocks don’t always do well even if the company is doing well. #googl and #msft not strong enough to pull market up on their own. Just listen to @option_snipper
121 2018-07-29 22:20:55 I can’t wait for a correction. Cheap stocks. Cheap real estate.
122 2018-07-29 22:18:11 A year ago, they had never heard of bump stocks. Today, they're in the Top 5 of public enemies. 

These people are lunatics.

124 2018-07-29 22:12:40 No because it would be a dick move to consider a kill after the time ran out, but it's not hard to understand the character dieing after the time, just look at the stocks when that happens
125 2018-07-29 22:12:00 Can’t be just me that thinks @Y_Not_Festival fully pulled out the stocks this year even with the terrible weather, i had a blast, and saw some of my absolute favourite artists. See you next year

130 2018-07-29 22:03:36 The era of FB will be over soon. PR nightmares, crashing stocks, and worst of all they don't seem to be able to reach the next generation.

Instagram fixes that for them.
131 2018-07-29 22:03:20 My God expect nothing less out of me, & I have nothing to do but my Ascension regards. I can go ahead & play stocks, earn billions for run while having at it.
132 2018-07-29 22:03:06 It would be prudent to adjust one's portfolio in preparation for IMO 2020. $XOM & $CVX have a strong presence in Nigera (low-sufur oil). $VDE is another way to get good exposure to those two stocks. $USO & $OILU are straight commodities plays. DM for additional thoughts.
133 2018-07-29 22:02:42 @realDonaldTrump  is sick & tired of the hatred that the Liberal Dems & MSM spew everyday! That's why we refuse to acknowledge their Hypocrocy & Idiocracy! Just look at Fake News CNN's ratings, what's happening to FB's stocks, & now Twitter's! We've had ENOUGH!
134 2018-07-29 22:01:20 The rich corps have taken all of the tax breaks and put them into stock buybacks to artificially increase the market. The goal was to invest their new cash flow into capex which would actually boost the economy. Instead they just make money on stocks and the poor get poorer.
135 2018-07-29 22:00:41 Profit warning $AMP sign of a lot more pain to come, warns @Bell_Potter. Cuts target to $2.75 from $3.30. Sell #Ausbiz #XJO #stockstowatch #investing #stocks #equities
136 2018-07-29 22:00:36 They are afraid of losing more stocks because of their Obama deal! Netflix is by no means faith-based.
137 2018-07-29 21:57:50 Positive results?? My stocks are nose diving!!
138 2018-07-29 21:50:53 Zuckerberg you’re going down down down in your Stocks
139 2018-07-29 21:50:42 I still don't understand the bond sentiment.  Are they bearish today but will be bullish next week if yield moves up 50bp? Are they bearish long term; ignoring treasuries will return 100% invested? Stocks and bonds are two different animals to me...
140 2018-07-29 21:50:31 Current Janome Winter deals. Snap up a bargain. Available until August 31st or whiles stocks last.
141 2018-07-29 21:48:53 Greatly enjoyed watching @bleedingedgedoc some names dropped $BAYN $JNJ $ISRG. Folks with money in medical devices/robotics like $MDT $MZOR $TRXC $SYK should watch as well.
142 2018-07-29 21:47:54 I will see how the stocks go lol
143 2018-07-29 21:45:58 53% of stocks in the S&P 500 have reported earnings so far. The earnings beat rate is running at 83%. For revenue, it's at 77%. Earnings are tracking a 21% increase. Another 140 stocks in the index report this week.
144 2018-07-29 21:43:44 NEOGEN PACT stocks rallying
145 2018-07-29 21:40:32 Retweeted Ken Fisher (@KennethLFisher):

Remember: the global yield curve is a more useful leading indicator for stocks and the global economy than any single country’s curve.
146 2018-07-29 21:40:24 I think the game is fast enough that 3 stocks should be the standard. And yeah, adding an extra minute should help.
147 2018-07-29 21:39:31 Now that I have money it's time to hit the stocks
148 2018-07-29 21:36:31 Some publishers have weird return policies though. There's one here in Germany that wants us to just rip off the covers of their comics if they're a little older, because they don't keep stocks of those.
149 2018-07-29 21:36:24 Bring back the stocks!
150 2018-07-29 21:35:53 Your clout going down like Facebook stocks and it's sad to see.

152 2018-07-29 21:31:08 Not to mention, they havent even finish the kitchen but some of the contractors are doing the rooms so we have to remove everything from both rooms and the kitchen. Not to mention they used our extra room to put the stocks. So we are completely out of space.
153 2018-07-29 21:31:02 Where will the Army get the food, medicines & fuel from? there will only be a finite stockpile

Seems to me that this will put extra stress on what meagre resources & food stocks we will have in the country

Bet a chinook uses more fuel than a Daff truck & has a smaller pay load

156 2018-07-29 21:24:14 If you invest in stocks you get periodic docs recommending you to vote "yes" on the latest management pay proposal. A 2.3% raise would be charming to imagine. An actual decrease would signal the bolsheviks are on the move.

171 2018-07-29 21:09:00 Kind of like everyone who did your scouting profiles for you but you take credit.
172 2018-07-29 21:08:38 I wanted to put 100 dollars on them in stocks on the gamble that if they survived their stock price would have to get higher but its been tanking every day so i havent even done that

183 2018-07-29 20:57:33 Like financial advisors who sell you the stocks and mutual funds that make them the most money. Also they sell you life insurance.
184 2018-07-29 20:55:22 Need More stocks
185 2018-07-29 20:54:28 I'm still here. Pondering whether I should sell all my stocks in american companies (except $TSLA) and invest them in $crypto at this point. The markets are going to go haywire when the ruling family in the US finally has to answer to the law. But when?
186 2018-07-29 20:53:53 I’m an exception! I will learn stocks, succeed and prosper!
187 2018-07-29 20:53:07 The question is are they the ones printed this year of are they old ones in their stocks from 2013 that are being brought out for set up stories.
188 2018-07-29 20:52:10 He’s talking about financial advisors. They sell you the products they make the most money off of, like certain stocks or mutual funds. Also they sell life insurance. They don’t advise you of anything.

In order to be rich in business, you need to know how to sell.
189 2018-07-29 20:50:49 yeah hes suffering but his mario is really close just close the stocks seem hard for him

195 2018-07-29 20:45:35 The corporations pumped all of their extra $$ into buying back many of their own stocks. No wage increases or more hiring. Oh.... and sending money back to their shareholders.

201 2018-07-29 20:37:11 Buying stocks in 2018 is worse than buying MySpace. Or buying Facebook. Terrible.
202 2018-07-29 20:37:11 I've been banging on about this for 2 years. @Tescos have restricted the amount of Silver Spoon products it stocks in favour of cane products. It's about the most unpatriotic thing I can think of
203 2018-07-29 20:36:56 Puede ser un pull back pero en vista de las decepciones en cuanto a resultados y como los stocks más alcistas están girandose...me hace pensar que puede no serlo. No hay que olvidar que llevamos 10 años de subidas..aunque mientras aguante no voy a ser yo el que lleve la contraria
204 2018-07-29 20:36:13 The number of units does not increase the total supply at all. Doesn’t matter how much you break it down the total supply will not change by any amount.

208 2018-07-29 20:31:51 Any anti conservatives company that tries to interfere with upcoming election could be in for trouble. I think Trump already went after Amazon. Stay away from tech stocks.
209 2018-07-29 20:31:41 About time. Don’t forget stocks. Stocks are terrible.
210 2018-07-29 20:27:45 Even with massive sell off....

Facebook stocks are still 15% higher today than in March of this year.

Too bad @FoxBusiness  hires quacks who are clueless.

214 2018-07-29 20:25:45 F that. Buy some stocks.
215 2018-07-29 20:23:40 Agree it is the same unhealthy sugar high we’ve seen before. But it could be good to have this while we deal with turbulence on trade.   Also, neither real estate nor stocks seem too far out of whack. Trade induced pause in climb of stocks seems to have helped in that regard.

217 2018-07-29 20:20:38 Remember last year was up, it’s very unlikely that this year will just fall apart yet. Most likely a sideways year with some seasonal correction in fall and/or after elections, but generally the stocks should marginally hold up for the year...

224 2018-07-29 20:15:12 @realDonaldTrump While everyone is celebrating some ridiculous GDP growth of 4%. Most stocks and companies are reporting losses that are worse than -20% this quarter compared to the rest of the year. I don't know who pays attention TO JUST ONE NUMBER? Are you all preschoolers?
225 2018-07-29 20:14:21 Starting to think about shorting stocks of companies that do things I dislike. It would make me a little happy to profit from their misfortunes.
226 2018-07-29 20:14:15 I day traded but primarily a long term investor. Made very good money in 1 day. In Florida and promised a family member to relax and not watch stocks for 14 days. My stock jumped $100k plus in one day then came a sell off. I made $35k and left $85k on table. Damn! Never again.

230 2018-07-29 20:09:53 Invest and watch it appreciate. Also put some in different stocks to diversify your portfolio.
231 2018-07-29 20:09:27 Lost decade since 2007 until 2017 is over... stocks could move higher unless a recession occurs during late cycle.
232 2018-07-29 20:08:41 Almost bought another car yesterday just to flex on you hoes but then I realized, I hate all of you and put that shit in stocks instead.
233 2018-07-29 20:06:48 Which are the stocks tp track among these
234 2018-07-29 20:05:00 Yup. Crowded short at this point while ppl are overly bullish on stocks. Sentiment flush needed.

While stocks last tomorrow, 2 updates to go 
244 2018-07-29 20:00:00 Lol no one said. The CEOS buy their own stocks with the tax breaks given to them. As a result the executives get richer and that creates a deficit. How do we pay off that deficit? The government starts cutting funding for infrastructure, student loans, etc and we also have to pay
245 2018-07-29 19:57:34 You must have a bad brokerage cause that's not the truth. The trend line only implies when it dropped  and Obama was in office. I've made over 100k so i should know. Bonds dont pay like stocks in return
246 2018-07-29 19:56:39 The short position it could idea but a short time. I believe that the stocks can keep more time in bullish trend for double top for is example 
247 2018-07-29 19:56:25 So many “Days to take notice”. Holes in key stocks.  So we have to tread lightly to see if Value/banks & other sectors hold mkt up
248 2018-07-29 19:56:24 In the way that we expect things are that during that time you would save up for your retirement. 401k, stocks and more are available to help reach those goals.
249 2018-07-29 19:55:07 ConocoPhillips (COP) edged past EPS targets but missed on revenue. Refinery stocks Valero Energy (VLO), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Phillips 66 (PSX) and CVR Refining (CVRR), rallied on strong results amid a wide spread between U.S. and Brent crude.
250 2018-07-29 19:54:49 Exxon Mobil, Chevron Earnings Miss; Refiners Hot. Dow Jones stocks Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) reported weaker than expected earnings, with Exxon production down 7%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) announced a $25 billion stock buyback, but earnings also came in light.

252 2018-07-29 19:49:49 (1/2) The past recessions have been earmarked by major corporate collapses. Enron / dotcom stocks around 2000. Banking / financials in 2007/2008.

What will it be this time around? Tesla would be a candidate if the bears are proven right.
253 2018-07-29 19:47:37 I understand that it’s cool but imo if they only put it on last stocks or allow it to be turned off it will be less annoying over long period of time
254 2018-07-29 19:47:02 I think the Horde's gonna approch Teldrassil, send a gobling spec ops squad, and they're gonna toss a grenade the wrong way. 
Right in the middle of the azerite stocks. Oopsie.
255 2018-07-29 19:46:07 SVB stock briefly hit a buy zone Friday morning but pared gains. Meanwhile Popular (BPOP) broke out after scoring an impressive double beat. Other top bank stocks rallied as the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yield spread widened from post-recession lows.

262 2018-07-29 19:40:38 added "the" before muhammad. fortunately twitter doesn't allow post edit, i didn't deleted. their stocks plunged
263 2018-07-29 19:38:04 Bearing in mind he was using bump stocks, what was the functional difference?
264 2018-07-29 19:35:05 Doing this results in your opponent forfeiting both of his stocks so the Ness would win.
265 2018-07-29 19:34:21 That's just fucked up. Ness is already a bad character but this is just a new low. 

Even if it means that the opponent loses 2 stocks it's still messed up and wrong.
266 2018-07-29 19:32:59 when i invest in stocks it’s over for you whores
267 2018-07-29 19:32:43 I haven’t loved it either, but I figure it makes a lot of sense for spectators. I can’t tell you the amount of events I’ve been watching with people or hosted with non-esports focused people who didn’t understand the concept of stocks. This will be huge for them.
268 2018-07-29 19:32:15 One guy/group bought 80% of the stocks float Friday which made it pump up. Business-wise, I think it’s all been a bit of sham from the get go..
269 2018-07-29 19:28:30 Enjoy the Tour de France win; because next year we won't be allowed to enter, won't have bikes, won't have roads to practice on, our crotches will be being eaten by super strength Brexit gonorrhea and we'll be selling our remaining stocks of EPO for black market nutella.

272 2018-07-29 19:24:41 Does anyone trading these stocks use hard stops or is that just a no no when playing these stocks?

277 2018-07-29 19:19:15 It is the boomerang backfire of the ages.

Thank you FB and Twitter for amplifying our rebel yell.

Stocks of food.
Stocks of cash.
282 2018-07-29 19:15:36 There are many more stocks that will do a Facebook. The markets always try and stay in equilibrium. Whenever the markets get too bearish or too bullish, the opposite price movement always occurs...

285 2018-07-29 19:12:17 This is interesting "The Long Term Stock Exchange." It's backed by some heavy hitters and I like the idea. I follow the market daily and see stocks sometimes get slammed for a "weak" quarter. At the same time, they are excellent companies with amazing long term goals and visions.
286 2018-07-29 19:12:05 Not so much with bump stocks.

294 2018-07-29 19:07:57 But the behavior of stocks as assets is different from the likes of land, commodities, gold n cash...

Stock has social values also...
295 2018-07-29 19:07:29 Interesting to see the Nintendo UK #SmashBrosUltimate Invitational use 3 stocks & 5 minutes for 1v1s. They've all been really close matches down to the last 30 seconds at times with what it seems like ~1.5 minutes for -1 stocks.

It'd be nice to 3 stocks & 6 (or 7 or 8) minutes

304 2018-07-29 18:59:14 It has subsided for technology companies lately, but for example there are plenty of other speculative companies that use the methods to go public early. Its an avenue for plenty of the weed stocks and blockchain cos that went public in Canada, due to low costs and oversight
305 2018-07-29 18:59:08 Question for anyone who has experience with stocks listed in multiple global markets...when a company lists in a secondary market, does it's primary mkt cap reduce so that the sum of the market caps stays the same?  Or does the primary market cap tend to hold?

312 2018-07-29 18:45:57 @jack @TwitterSupport. Why dont you have an option to report a violation based on their repeated displays of #FakeNews?  No wonder why your stocks are falling. #WalkAway
313 2018-07-29 18:45:54 Next you will be banning Bump stocks for Fully Automatic Assault straws and Straws with Bayonet Lugs or Grenade Launchers, When will this madness end!!!!
314 2018-07-29 18:45:44 That country singer claimed to be a “2a supporter” yet supports a ban on slide fire stocks and thinks the government should track how much ammo and firearms a person has. Guess he was so busy supporting the 2a that he skipped over the line “Shall not be infringed”
315 2018-07-29 18:45:17 Typical for us is under $500k some stocks. Over $500k you get all 20-25 stock positions. But we use ETFs and mutual funds to round out our target allocation.
316 2018-07-29 18:45:05 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.
317 2018-07-29 18:44:27 Ya'll need to chill. Strip just needs a skipped start, maybe a phantom 10 day dl. Then he'll be fine. He's not going back to the pen. Hes just tired. My king of stocks is not used to this workload.
318 2018-07-29 18:43:59 Citing 4% GDP growth as a be all to end all is naive if not ignorant,as is dumping the burden of a $1.5 TRILLION tax give away( aka. Stkmt share 'buy back) on middle income earners, when 50% of the pop. don't own stock & of the 50% that do, 10% of them own 80 % of all stocks WTF?
319 2018-07-29 18:43:53 We need more money!!! We add more stocks the higher the account value. We have to have proper diversification. We use mostly sector ETFs as more concentrated. Our experience was people preferred a smoother ride and we gave up no return.
320 2018-07-29 18:43:12 Bata at around 800-920 and relaxo at around 800 is at multiyear breakouts and markets betting big on these two stocks and can be really very good potential 50% giver in next 1 year. Just buy and forget these 2 stocks and make money
321 2018-07-29 18:40:49 No human is worth a million per hour either Jay. It's insane to demand people who can't work due to sickness to work under threat of starving them while Jeff Bezos makes a million an hour while sleeping because the greed for Amazon stocks makes it so
322 2018-07-29 18:40:45 Really? I have a MBA with a focus in economics. Also, spent four years in the job market selling stocks/bonds and insurance. You?

324 2018-07-29 18:37:23 Research and faith bro lol. Mainly looking at which companies have big time investors backing em, and seeing which ones are partnering up with big distribution companies. It’s my first time with stocks, so I’m learning on the fly, but it’s always a chance that it won’t work
325 2018-07-29 18:36:40 Invest in stocks, not in friends 
326 2018-07-29 18:36:34 You can already buy fractions or multi holdings of stocks through ETFs
327 2018-07-29 18:35:33 No, didn’t know you could hire them. Going to a local garden centre that stocks them tomorrow to work out how much I need to save.
328 2018-07-29 18:35:04 I’m not a fan of the tariffs but my stocks sure love the economy. How about the EU saying they’ll drop tariffs and committing to buying soy beans to help the farmers and also buying natural gas?

337 2018-07-29 18:26:49 In the name of average Americans, the #GOPTaxScam, borrows from the rich, and gives it to the rich.

Most rich people have no choice but to put it in stock markets, and over inflate stocks.

How will future average Americans pay for this GOP theft?
338 2018-07-29 18:26:38 Speaking of crises, Mark, there's one scheduled to hit your own constituents next March when we may or may not have stocks of #adequatefood or meds.

As UK hasn’t produced enough food to feed itself for over a century, what disaster relief are you coordinating for MK North?
339 2018-07-29 18:25:23 #HDFCAMC Applying for IPO seems like a waste of time. If the issue is good, getting allotment is a lottery, if bad, you are left holding lemons. Rather utilise the time to research already listed stocks. Plenty available at good valuation.

341 2018-07-29 18:23:13 Is this why their stocks went down?  They did it?
342 2018-07-29 18:22:14 The market knows what happens to cyclical stocks when the economy downturns, hence the low PER

346 2018-07-29 18:15:33 USD/CNY is a black box, we have no idea what the Chinese are planning next. If they do a one-off devaluation of 10, 20, 25%, #Gold will soar to new highs imho. If they continue the stealth deval on a daily basis, Gold is going lower until stocks crash.
347 2018-07-29 18:15:05 Glad I didn’t have stocks in Facebook.

350 2018-07-29 18:10:35 I need a new Smash GC controller. OG controller's joysticks are too loose for how hard I push, the bounceback when I let go always flicks me back the opposite direction. It's lost me countless stocks and killls recently. Can't compete until I find one, but I'm not spending $150.
351 2018-07-29 18:09:32 given that only 10% (the richest) own 84% of stocks now...crashing the market would not serve the current administration
352 2018-07-29 18:07:55 Borrowing a trillion dollars from the USA doesn't make you a great economist Lying Trump. Besides, companies just took the cash and reinvested into their own stocks making them wealthier. Idiot Trump thinks he is an economic genius. LOL
353 2018-07-29 18:07:34 Yes it is. It’s the Evil Roy edition, which is basically the silver finish. The wood stocks were too old school so I sent them out to my cerakote guy to change it up.

363 2018-07-29 17:58:31 Opioids are traded on the Stock Market! How do investors get rich? Big gains, how?, Big sales! How? More written Prescriptions!! This equal epidemic and Crisis that won't stop because sales will drop and stocks will drop! Corporate caused this epidemic and Republicans won't stop.
364 2018-07-29 17:57:32 Yes imho. Will be able to pick up an overvalued property at a discount when stock market crashes later this year. Assuming the Fed and global central banks revert to QE, ZIRP/NIRP, thereafter, home prices will follow stocks higher again thereafter. But that window will be brief.
365 2018-07-29 17:55:41 You must of slept through the last four years, of George W. Bush's administration, tarriffs and tax cuts brought this country to it's knees !!!!
The rich want recessions, they buy stocks and property foreclosures, for a small amount, and then sell them later at full price.
366 2018-07-29 17:55:39 The debt from #GOPTaxScam is an elephant in the room.

In the name of the average Americans, the #TaxScam, borrows from the rich, & gives it to the rich.

Most rich people have no choice but to put it in markets & over inflate stocks.

How will future Americans pay for GOP theft?
367 2018-07-29 17:54:47 Wondering what kind of stocks I should look into? Anyone have advice?
368 2018-07-29 17:53:40 Unlike completely subsidized corporate wind power? Right! Let me guess, your retirement is completely wrapped up in wind energy investments, possibly many in the form of "gift" stocks. Hmm, I wonder who your donors are...
369 2018-07-29 17:53:20 .@LeTour @letour_uk Given that it’s 2018, any reason why the #tdf2108 winners had to share their podium with inanely-grinning podium girls? Is it the only way you can think to involve women seeing as there’s no women’s race?

Tourism down significantly, soybean farmers need $12billion bailout, Canada declared war on our goods, food rotting in fields, deportations will cost billions &the national debt exploded b/c GOP face corps $$ to buy back stocks
389 2018-07-29 17:33:27 -200 for bottom line (buy) will be the most conservative & 200 for the toppling (sell). but I would suggest to adjust them to your liking. The default works well for me on most stocks/coins/forex but always check RSI as well & price action. The indicator is only to help further
390 2018-07-29 17:30:02 As long as you stick to your own style, you get the good and bad in your own approach. #trade #forex #stocks
391 2018-07-29 17:29:19 Casinos rarely fail...  Then there's Trump steaks, magazines, airline, University, and many others. Only the one started with his daddy's money is still viable...  And that would be with twice as much if he just put the money in indexed stocks.
392 2018-07-29 17:29:10 Yakult stocks.
393 2018-07-29 17:28:24 Now u all know that if companies didn't make shareholders happy that they would sell their stocks and then no one would get their 80 million dollar bonuses
394 2018-07-29 17:27:08 Could we also say the same thing about the key financial elements with which to value stocks? Except in cases of fraud they're almost always known. But my how we disagree over time about their worth.
395 2018-07-29 17:26:45 Wouldnt surprise me at all - but also potential for BOTH stocks and bonds to sell off together.....correlations are not fixed and given QT and FED increase in Sept could easily prompt sell off in bonds which drags down stocks
396 2018-07-29 17:26:07 Wow. My daughter works for a large corporation. They have given them stocks and bonuses twice now due to the “scam.”
397 2018-07-29 17:25:22 Oooooo good one.
398 2018-07-29 17:25:18 And mining is a difficult enough enterprise to be successful in. You add a lot of these Vancouver pumper & dumpers, shiesty TSX Venture stocks & it turns the odds vastly against the retail investor. Ameduri's days are numbered, but he has piles of other peoples' $$$$$ to enjoy
399 2018-07-29 17:24:13 I called my mom and she started talking about investing and buying stocks 
400 2018-07-29 17:22:05 Your illegally here so yeah get the F out and wait in line
401 2018-07-29 17:21:55 I died at men are like stocks 

I'm 31 and she's 21 and laughing feels mean.On the other hand I was already a bitch at 20(not as bad a bitch as I am now and I def gave more space to guys then)but I never fought women over men's "rights". EVER. I did not put men before women
402 2018-07-29 17:21:34 As I've already explained to you, Benji, I do not use price targets in my newsletter; in addition, I evaluate (and sometimes revise) my buy limits for all recommended stocks (inc. $MNKD) MONTHLY... so I'm not sure what you're fishing for (or why you're so panicked about it)?
403 2018-07-29 17:20:44 We'll have more than 20 weapons - each with lots of customization options - silencers, barrells, stocks, sights, magazines, grips, laser modules, flashlights, paints, emblems etc. that gives you a hundreds of possible gun modification
404 2018-07-29 17:20:30 Maybe the fundamentals themselves have changed due to reforms and market is pricing in future value?. If I remember correctly, I think investors using PE of Nifty had a threshold of 23 to exit stocks. Maybe there is a tech breakout in this threshold?
405 2018-07-29 17:20:06 How do I buy stocks of Pedialyte? Everyone drinking that this morning!
406 2018-07-29 17:16:32 If it’s ICOs they are profiting from, well that’s the new pump and dump scheme similar to penny stocks.  That is a zero sum game operating under the veil of “blockchain innovation” and “world decentralization”.  Will be interesting to see when things become real again...
407 2018-07-29 17:16:13 Forex is not a scam. It is part of the financial market, like stocks, bonds etc. People like shortcuts. That is why they get scammed.

It has been proven by Robert Mueller that the Russians hacked our election.  

Background checks, ban to bump stocks, ban to magazines over the size of 10, etc.
410 2018-07-29 17:14:05 bull shit. don't judge by short term performance. avoid tata digital fund. it had IT stocks by mandate and hence lucky to have that.
411 2018-07-29 17:14:01 If your taxes are simple that means you don’t own a home, have college savings or have stocks. In fact that means you are living off my taxes and rely on my ability to be a consumer. It means you aren’t contributing to our economy nor are you self sufficient
412 2018-07-29 17:13:49 Worse yet.. probably not a shoe store that stocks New Balance nearby either!!
413 2018-07-29 17:13:43 Save your money man. Put it in Ali Baba stocks, buy some real estate, invest it somewhere. As soon as you buy that car and drive it off the lot you just lost $35,000.

418 2018-07-29 17:10:03 Struck a nerve cos you’re a medic? Do the research rather than fall back on prejudices. Does Greece want to leave EU? No because they understand the benefits. Leavers always go on about fisheries but quotas saved stocks even if sold to NL, ES etc
419 2018-07-29 17:09:09 Throw in a bunch of funds in 401Ks that literally balance, between SP500 clone and SP500 growth stocks, daily.

Oh look, FB down, well we gotta scoop up more of that by selling the others.

421 2018-07-29 17:08:02 This post is a GIGANTIC DISTORTION of reality. Just for starters, Obama NEVER got to 3% for a calendar yr. Also, before the election, loads of Dem/lefty econs, pols, etc. said GDP would be at 1.8% or so for many yrs if #HILLARY won. If @Trump won, GDP and the stocks would crash!

But like, I even had like an hour long discussion with my brother and mother about this whole thing and explained why stocks are a thing and stuff... So it's not like I don't know the shit
425 2018-07-29 17:05:16 I am very sorry for your loss. I have heard the same from Mormon friends. Pharmaceuticals are ok but not something natural that may work better, not even non-psychoactive CBD. Meanwhile Mormon church owns over $1 billion in pharma stocks.

436 2018-07-29 16:56:08 Also need to consider overall #investment potential of #uranium sector. In 2007 over 500 #U3O8 related #stocks in a US$130B sector.

438 2018-07-29 16:53:57 No doubt about that mate but theres a reason they havnt released yet imo..3/4 of stocks due from 30th june have done..timesheets don't stop the update..think we will find out this week...Backers below 3% and the update im hoping for..
439 2018-07-29 16:53:47 Which is a blatant lie, you aren’t allowed to work at 11 years old little buddy . And stocks have dropped since trump been in office. Don’t you actually watch the stock market? Or do you just listen to what trump says? Because this is an exact parrot of what trump said.
440 2018-07-29 16:53:00 I've never heard before about these investing "gurus" and life coaches.Just checked out their site, basic lifestyle BS without any substance pushing usually crypto/stocks(ETF pipe dream. Oh add a bit of "get rich with real estate" dream.  This tweet already disqualify them enough
441 2018-07-29 16:50:47 How do you pay interest on 15 trillion? You print the interest in Yen. This creates a liquid and credit crisis, which makes bonds and stocks sell to raise Yen. Makes the Yen soar to raise physical cash to pay Yen debt. Then it crashes...
442 2018-07-29 16:50:40 what the fucks a Facebook story? Now there's snapchat on every app known to man? "Oh wait, a second while I post a story on my STOCKS APPLICATION"
443 2018-07-29 16:49:15 In that case no easy answer, depends on how much, what it's invested in and where (type of stocks and UK/ overseas split), what the money's for, when you want to access it, where you're going to be living, how reliant you are on the money etc etc.

446 2018-07-29 16:46:36 In volatile market, retail investors shd invest through MFs.

449 2018-07-29 16:45:25 ‘Product of Ireland’, it says on the tin of unicorn meat: so stocks can’t be easily replenished once they’ve run out after Brexit.  Is the government stockpiling gammon? We’ve a huge supply of that, but it may be tough and leathery because of the high average age of the porkers.
450 2018-07-29 16:45:12 And what has Trump destroyed? Give examples! All I see is he is fixing USA gave us tax cuts , added 3.7million jobs unemployment down across the board stocks up companies coming back to USA! A end to the Korean War showed dems & media’s true colors!

460 2018-07-29 16:39:16 I would also like to mention that their stocks fell incredibly over the last 3 days once Trump called out the shadowbanning partisanship.
461 2018-07-29 16:37:05 The difference is that you can adjust spending.  Just saying 4% may be too high for many people given current p/e on stocks and current bond yields., especially if you want to provide for children.  Whatever rate you pick, it has to include income taxes and investment expenses.
462 2018-07-29 16:36:15 None of the stock reactions in gold made sense...aside from the stocks having hung in better through gold’s recent decline...adter underperforming its rise. ABX decline was also unwarranted. Does it really matter if earnings are 0.08 or $0.03 for these companies in a qtr?!
463 2018-07-29 16:35:11 You know aunty stocks up on conditioner now
464 2018-07-29 16:33:51 It depends, but probably less than 4% for most people given the current p/e of stocks and current bond yields.  It depends on how much you want to leave for your children.  Whatever rate you use, it has to include income taxes and investment expenses.

466 2018-07-29 16:33:34 If Spot price however goes back to June 2007 levels @ $135 lb (prior to when #URA launched) then IMO once we get over Spot of $65 then URA is in unchartered waters...many stocks were over x 20 share values today in June 2007 so I would hope history repeats

They said on today's Sunday shows that he has vowed to "start" campaigning for R's 60 days b4 11/06. In actuality, he hasn't quit campaigning since his own last elec. in 2016, but that's another story.

477 2018-07-29 16:23:49 Most project fails will result in greater wealth to the founder.  Human Nature and Psychology dictate the norm and the outcomes.  Just like many penny stocks fail yet management seem to come out okay.
478 2018-07-29 16:23:28 And the GOP is full of rich, old men who seek to make themselves even richer. Great ride with the DOW but you have to be rich enough to have stocks. Many aren’t. GOP wants to take away entitlement programs many rely on
479 2018-07-29 16:21:38 Stricter gun laws does punish us just because of someone else’s sins, but I will agree bump stocks need to go , like the one guy used in Las Vegas.  Enforce the laws we have. New laws will not stop some lunatic that is sick in the head

“If you are trading stocks or wagering on sports...above all else, don’t lose all your money”.
482 2018-07-29 16:18:16 Exactly. And he still thought if he got enough twitter comments, he could get bump stocks banned.

493 2018-07-29 16:07:03 That $2.3B Vanguard Precious Metals&Mining Fund was more than a name change(to Global Capital Cycles Fund). Mining stocks (mostly gold stocks) as % of fund drops from 80% to 25%. May explain why big-cap precious metals stocks have been oddly underperforming smaller names (more)
494 2018-07-29 16:06:05 The #stocks everyone going with Monday morning.
495 2018-07-29 16:05:35 I’m now of the opinion a stock is only bottom drawer if you don’t regularly trade or hold stocks and you just buy the odd one tick it away and never look at it for several years.  God knows what it’s will be then but with any luck you’ll be in profit.
496 2018-07-29 16:05:23 Because liberal snowflakes don't have money to invest in the market. The conservatives who do are selling off tech stocks.

506 2018-07-29 15:59:40 After rebounding from a 10% correction earlier this year, the S&P 500 is close to an all-time high and on track for its best year relative to stocks in the rest of the world since 2014.
507 2018-07-29 15:59:25 If growth (now) and inflation (soon) peak my bet is that streak ends. Tough comps going forward and stocks don't do as well in a slowing growth climate. Time will tell.
508 2018-07-29 15:59:14 Piyush Jee, unexpected question from you.

Yes we can with index shares , atleast 2 to 5 stocks with different positions.
509 2018-07-29 15:57:45 Teck stocks that have significantly declined last week by approx. -20%: Facebook & Twitter. Guess who is next? Correct $TSLA, will be an exciting Q2 conf call. I hope Elon had his favourite Ambien & Wine Cocktail with a little shot of Teslaquila @WPipperger

513 2018-07-29 15:54:19 Facebook and Twitter stocks drop BIG TIME. No consequences here that it occurred to both on the same week. USER growth has gone down PLUS people concerned about PRIVACY! So is Twitter Shadow-Banning The GOP. Companies Denies it. No Shadow-Banning done to ANY LIBERALS!

The last of the Bullish buying from Feb has hit the market. Now we are seeing what they were buying in May
519 2018-07-29 15:49:35 You can't even get 5000 comments to ban bump stocks, but you think you can influence midterm elections. Narcissism is not a admirable trait son.

How to make money in stocks
Trading in the zone
522 2018-07-29 15:46:03 I want some money I think may start playing with stocks
523 2018-07-29 15:45:46 Another big lie that needs push back!
@realDonaldTrump did not inherit a broken economy.

When PBO left:
Unemployment at lowest point in a decade
Corporate profits & stocks at all time high

Only thing that hadn’t caught up was a living wage
#AMJoy
524 2018-07-29 15:43:03 If the markets have to always only go up. Then everyone will make money all the time. Currently just 5 nifty stocks have been deliberately kept up to manage the index to keep mutual  fund flows intact.
525 2018-07-29 15:41:20 I never said money doesnt matter in life, just that its not a reason to not be with a person if theyre doing things that will improve their life in the future. My mom taught me men are like stocks when young. She was with my dad when he had nothing and now he makes almost 6 figs
526 2018-07-29 15:40:55 Forbes showed that if Trump had simply invested his inheritance in stocks that kept pace with the S&P 500 and sat back & done nothing, he'd be worth 4-5 times what he is now.  Trump is a failed businessman.
527 2018-07-29 15:39:14 At the very least, if you have stocks in your pension plan you are better off.
528 2018-07-29 15:38:57 Honestly, it may depend on the exchange ppl on Bitmex have certainly complained 

Especially when their is lagging in their system during high volume times

I would certainly think its independent of exchange and it would happen in crypto just like Forex/Stocks
529 2018-07-29 15:38:14 If it makes you feel any better, I sold all my stocks of them right before they dipped. Moviepass is falling apart
530 2018-07-29 15:38:04 Even though nobody has DM'd me for tips, I am not going to be posting any alleged bagger stocks later. 

For clarity, I will also not be posting any videos of stocks to follow or any blogs which purportedly portray me as an 'expert'.
531 2018-07-29 15:38:00 So anything happens to @realDonaldTrump expect stocks to crash, housing market to crash,  and job market to crash. #nobueno. #enjoytoday #PayAttention
532 2018-07-29 15:36:24 Still hard to believe you don't think of these "low priced" coins as penny stocks? The coins are certainly showing plenty of signs that they are in fact penny stocks.
533 2018-07-29 15:35:55 @jack 's lawyers can write all the TOS they want but in America we have certain rights.. and no liberal Calif Lawyer or San Francisco liberal can take that away.. lets see what happens to Twitter stocks soon. 
534 2018-07-29 15:35:51 Travis Perkins posts half-year results on Tuesday. Expect like-for-like sales growth of 3.8% in Q2.

539 2018-07-29 15:29:49 I need to learn about investing into stocks.
540 2018-07-29 15:29:48 I need to buy stocks. 
541 2018-07-29 15:29:15 I'm in stocks. I like stocks. I've seen this movie before. Many novices got destroyed in after 2000 and again after 2007. It will happen again. Again, not talking about genius Twitter traders.
542 2018-07-29 15:28:58 Real bubble has already formed on the American high-tech equity market. Indices grow solely due to activity in individual stocks. The only question is when will it burst. FAANG will lead that downfall.
543 2018-07-29 15:28:11 Let’s see you’re stupid when it comes to guns & how they work! Bump stock, I can’t stop laughing, they DO NOT MAKE A SEMI AUTOMATIC GUN AUTOMATIC! Bump stocks are useless as there is NO control of your weapon. Where is all the brass from him shooting? Have you seen his picture?

560 2018-07-29 15:16:42 Calling FB & Twitter “tech stocks” seems to me to be a misnomer. Neither company produces anything other than an advertising platform. No chips, no devices, no things. If they disappeared tomorrow the only people that would a hit are stockholders.

562 2018-07-29 15:13:36 Locking up those "illegal immigrants" in private prisons: that's what this about: profits for scumbags. After Trump was elected, Stocks for private prisons skyrocketed. No coincidence.

566 2018-07-29 15:12:25 @ffweekend every news source focusing on tech stocks and why they are dropping in value here is real reason as Facebook & Twitter being exposed as left leaning biased entities conservatives will and are not using them as much as success of our President becomes more apparent!
567 2018-07-29 15:12:20 Invest in stocks & bonds and get into trading. Educate yourself on it all.
568 2018-07-29 15:11:34 Certain meds have a short shelf life so have to be replaced often...you can't stockpile them so you can have about a months reserve. Medications used in chemotherapy are very short lifespan...this is where the low stocks will start after we leave.

583 2018-07-29 14:58:58 Tesla is the only stock i understand.  I don't care about stocks.  I understand Tesla because it is at the intersection of my other interests.
584 2018-07-29 14:58:17 2018 has indeed put the spotlight back on quality stocks, but what exactly is quality and how can a common investor quantitatively assess this very qualitative and therefore subjective concept called “Quality”? Have not included MCap as an option coz "Quality is MCap agnostic" !
585 2018-07-29 14:56:51 Be careful not to instantly dismiss #stocks that are losing money if Co is shifting to or operates a recurring rev model. You can often buy them at very low price or EV to sales multiples.The P/E crowd will eventually join you once the biz scales to reach profit inflection points
586 2018-07-29 14:56:41 Q: what are your thoughts on people who don’t want to put their energy into (investing), who would rather pay someone
A: a lot of experienced advisors won’t be talking to you unless you have a sizeable portfolio...I recommend ETFs & some money set aside for having fun with stocks
587 2018-07-29 14:54:18 You can get both of these sets on Amazon at a good price, I also have the Laputa guardian robot figure and head planter but I would love to be in a shop that stocks this merch. Son also buying Gunpla, much cheaper importing from Japan.
588 2018-07-29 14:52:20 True,that’s the most important thing I’ve learned in @AjAwesomecalls just because i can size in cheap stocks doesn’t mean that the high risk worth it ,when at the same time i could pick up fewer stock for 5-10pts play and basically achieve the same profit without the high risk.

629 2018-07-29 14:25:51 So the institutional investors will keep on throwing good money after bad buying even more Tesla stocks in order to continue keeping the stockprice artificially propped up?
No problem I can wait
630 2018-07-29 14:23:50 Author of 14 is the new 15 "According to the leaders of the global warming doomsday cult"  Does this sound like a bias assessment of the negligence used by corporations to sell you pharmaceutical , automobiles, alcohol, asbestos, created contaminated sites, plundered fish stocks?

635 2018-07-29 14:16:11 This yr I based my investment strategy on the assumption of a extended market trading range. Thus you buy stocks that have blown up and sell rallies. No trend following. But this week so many stocks have blown up I can't keep track of them. Tremendous turmoil under the surface.

650 2018-07-29 14:01:31 Thank you @realDonaldTrump for challenging the R legislators to not be afraid of @NRA and pass universal background checks and ban bump-stocks. Your consistent pressure sure did the trick. I feel so much safer now.

664 2018-07-29 13:50:27 Lots of bear traders are anxious to get short lots of stocks, only after the fact. They missed great entries & wanna chase pennies over dollars. I'm anxious to get back home to take the other side of that trade, only after they pile in like sardines.
665 2018-07-29 13:49:39 So KSA fully eliminates its stocks, while depressing prices.  Then what? How does destocking solve a structural supply shortage? That's like spending the same amount that got you into trouble, but doing it on your line of credit, and CC's, and thinking that solves the problem.

667 2018-07-29 13:46:39 The government have failed - they are planning for stockpiles of food and medical supplies and  for a flotilla of barges with generators to keep the lights on in NI - but the reason you oppose a delay is that it would postpone the gains your fund will make which shorts UK stocks

669 2018-07-29 13:45:26 Bring back the stocks
670 2018-07-29 13:45:18 We are smart to not put all eggs in value funds and diversify into growth stocks also. That goes to show even you don’t understand right way to invest. 
671 2018-07-29 13:44:12 It is because of distributors’ inability to sell funds that fund manager have to keep holding mediocre stocks and take care of tracking error. Otherwise fund manager are capable of generating much better returns.

677 2018-07-29 13:39:36 Let me rush to pick mine while stocks last.
678 2018-07-29 13:39:30 Está apagada la maquinita (no hay más Adelantos Transitorios del BCRA al Tesoro), los agregados monetarios creciendo bien abajo de la inflación, y las altas tasas obligan a liquidar stocks o cerrar. Entiendo q pasaje a precios de la devaluación va a ser más bajo q en anteriores.
679 2018-07-29 13:37:51 So true. Huge difference between one leader who travels the world offering apologies and the other working out fair trade agreements when told couldn’t happen; NATO paying fair share; NOKO successful negotiating; stocks up; unemployment record lows for all; GDP amazing! Etc etc
680 2018-07-29 13:35:39 Their publishing possibilities, like the immediate 500k job losses the fall of the pound and crashing stocks and shares the moment after we voted leave. - didn’t happen, UK Plc is in great shape. 

Read the Telegraph for an opposing view.. MSM are biased

682 2018-07-29 13:31:34 Remember filling in data about food stocks, vehicles, fuel etc for the Emergency Planning Index in the ‘80s. Govt planning for Cold War / nuclear strikes. Wonder how much of the UK were aware of that?

683 2018-07-29 13:30:13 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
684 2018-07-29 13:29:12 Can’t freedom loving Americans pass background checks? What’s the point of Bump stocks & Silencers. The 2nd amendment does need to be regulated. If you make it to Congress you will swear and oath to up hold the constitution which calls for a “Well Regulated” 2nd amendment.
685 2018-07-29 13:28:44 Literally every year this team rotates players ALL OVER the depth chart in and out of of first team reps. And every year these beat writers pontificate and put weight on what it all means for individual player stocks . Like a damn hamster on a wheel.

704 2018-07-29 13:08:55 Awesome interview.  Pierre’s observation about how much more wealth will be stored in bitcoin rather than stocks and real estate is exactly right. Those have become poor substitutes for people looking for money’s store of value.  Global production will be saved in bitcoin
705 2018-07-29 13:08:26 .@stevenmnuchin1 on Tech stocks: I’m not concerned about this at all and again investors should have diversified portfolios, the tech stocks have obviously had an incredible run and you look at the NASDAQ...the S&P...the DOW, the markets obviously doing very well. #FNS

718 2018-07-29 12:51:03 The first lesson for linguists imo should be the lesson from the early days of the equal rights movement: If you use "their" language, you've already lost the argument. In this case the arguments about mental health&weapons, police readiness for terror attacks and bump-stocks.

724 2018-07-29 12:41:43 Think Johns being a little sarcastic but he’s only quoting what many remainers are stating as “facts”. In my opinion for every problem there is a solution.

-Ban bump stocks
-Keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers
-Universal background checks

898 2018-07-29 09:13:20 Ok, so it looks like an economic downturn led by US tech stocks chiefly the FAANGs by October. Compounded by Boomers exiting ‘productive’ life and drawing down on pension funds hurt by Fed’s low interest rates. Buckle up people, rides gonna get rocky.
899 2018-07-29 09:13:14 @KesterSharpe I’m somewhat concerned by the use of brown bread for eggy bread!! White bread with sugar and lemon all the way

916 2018-07-29 08:54:26 great write up sir ji, losing 30-40% on junk, hope stocks portfolio can be terrorizing when one does not know if those losses will ever recover. Especially for the salaried folk where even 10% salary hike is hard to come by every year. No thanks! I am Happy with market return.
917 2018-07-29 08:54:16 Any investor who has no concern for valuation is effectively subscribing to the “greater fool” theory, the idea that there will always be somebody more foolish to buy your expensive stocks at an even higher price at a later stage.

Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet are the five technology giants trading publicly. As of Mar. 20, 2018, the market capitalization of these companies summed up to $472.38B + $760.36B + $888.66B + $136.92B + $757.54B = $3.015 trillion.

943 2018-07-29 07:58:09 There were some high-profile blowups, notably Facebook and Biogen, following Netflix (NFLX) in the prior week. Twitter and Intel sold off too. But Alphabet, Chipotle (CMG) and Amazon stocks rallied on strong earnings. The U.S. economy is strong, with GDP expanding at a 4.1%

997 2018-07-29 06:53:20 Yes, they discovered where the bass shoaled up to spawn (Mid-Channel and Western Approaches) and how to catch them. Bass are slow growing (a 10lb fish could be 13 to 30 years old) so vulnerable to overfishing. Also some bad spawning years resulting in declining stocks.

One should start only to quality stocks, that have a long runway of growth ahead & have good Mgmnt.
My only caveat is that buy them at reasonable valuations. Market Idiosyncrasies provide such opportunities. Bear markets are opportunities to buy such stocks.

1006 2018-07-29 06:36:34 Another thing to take into account is that companies from stocks are planning to transfer the shares into security tokens. This could be huge for the crypto market and if Bitcoin rises, from a Satoshi perspective, a lot of coins could be at their high again.
1007 2018-07-29 06:36:14 No need to own all stocks which goes up. No need for even all stocks in portfolio to go up. More winners than losers in portfolio would deliver good long term results.
1008 2018-07-29 06:35:56 Gold has higher stocks to flow and therefore marginal utility.
1009 2018-07-29 06:35:38 No need to own all stocks which goes up. No need for even all stocks in portfolio to go up. More winners than losers in portfolio would deliver good long term results.

1011 2018-07-29 06:34:28 There are a few ‘high quality no brainier’ stocks which have moved up 50% from January 2018 even while the entire market is down 40%. You don’t always need market help to make money -  all you need is earnings growth and a management whom you can trust with what he says.
1012 2018-07-29 06:33:17 not to sound like a stereotype, but cryptos, gold, oil, stocks and other assets could work just as well as a store of wealth since what creates it is just voluntary trading.

1028 2018-07-29 06:05:21 Chat pumps are easy to spot, they usually are low float, low volume stocks that squeeze out of nowhere. Usually mid day they target these things. And in most cases it dumps off a cliff

1040 2018-07-29 05:44:48 Nifty PE is higher due to few stocks like Asian paints,Bajaj finance & service,HUL,Titan company,HDFC Bank,Kotak Bank but on the contrary PE of metal companies and few banks are already to low...so it’s unlikely that nifty fall much from this level..might be go sideways
1041 2018-07-29 05:44:14 Lost my job, heavy losses in stocks, I’m in heavy debts, family disturbed. I was trying to figure out the reason but couldn’t find one. Then one Libgandu friend came in my life, he checked out all my personal details, schedules & concluded it’s all because I’ve got an Aadhar card
1042 2018-07-29 05:42:27 That is why the thumb rule of 10 to 20 stocks is ideal for an individual portfolio.
1043 2018-07-29 05:41:58 You must not understand a lot more than risk, which is why we’re all taking home a small fortune, and you’ll just continue to bash the best stocks of the year. You’re obviously as dumb as a box of rocks you stupid fuck!
1044 2018-07-29 05:41:39 Before the events you mentioned, gangs of neo-nazis attacked Ukrainian government's offices & officials in Kiev, Lvov, Rivno, Ivanovo-Frankovsk, & so on. They looted stocks of weapons from the Ukrainian police & Army, killing a few service men & ousted the legitimate President.
1045 2018-07-29 05:36:47 This is interesting, thank you.

If you’re looking for suggestions, it would also be fun to see the most-held stocks, with figures normalised to account for the size of the free float.
1046 2018-07-29 05:36:43 Overdiversification protects you from portfolio drifts. Even if your allocation drifts, you will not get concentrated in too few stocks and therefore don't need to make adjustments, that often would cause negative tax consequences.

You cant ask poll questions like
1) Are you happy?
2) Do you make enough money?

1073 2018-07-29 05:00:03 Obviously the solution is to pay executives more and lower taxes on profits made from the sale of stocks. Clearly rich didn't get enough money from the first boost to get them to spend adequately enough.  Just keep making them richer and it'll workout.  He promises.

1110 2018-07-29 03:54:26 (1/2)Morally, politicians and lawyers are cheating by circumventing laws. Bump stocks can be imitated by a thumb and belt loop. Let’s count how many other people have died by this means. LV was a tragedy, but it’s not the #2A tool’s fault, nor the @NRA
1111 2018-07-29 03:51:05 even over a decade it will hurt because just a handful of expensive stocks would have grown underlying earnings too. Not all quality stocks have so much growth. rest will fall off the cliff.

It pertained to stocks in the company. Obama released Iranian $ AFTER Iran signed a deal to stop its nuclear program.
1131 2018-07-29 03:22:49 As a side note, have you noticed a trend in Twitter and FB stocks? This has a lot to do with the fact that people can’t trust them to be an honest or fair platform. Investors will pull their money and the stock value with fall. #capitalism
1132 2018-07-29 03:21:06 The millionaires in Congress didn't start out that way. They make laws that can affect companies fortunes, there is no law preventing them from buying or shorting stocks before those laws are made public.

1162 2018-07-29 02:41:10 think there's selection bias here... how many winners sold subsquently went down? how many not-so obvious stocks that you didn't own went up? are these consumer stocks obvious in hindsight? if you sell, and it keeps going up, you probably didn't understand what you had bought.

1266 2018-07-29 00:33:42 Of course zero Democtats will acknowledge the President. It's almost 2 years that he's running this nation, economy is getting better, & stocks reaches 25k. None of them can't see that because they hated him. Too bad because President Trump is also your Pres.
1267 2018-07-29 00:33:10 This guy trades weed production stocks lol that is so funny to me
1268 2018-07-29 00:32:35 Weeellllll, @FatalityFalcon is pretty damn good at this game. He beat me convincingly. I'm just glad I didn't get JV3'd and took some stocks. Good job, dude

Had fun at the monthly, thank you to @TheRoflfox for putting it on! Was nice to see people again.

But soon the Wall Street will shadow ban these over inflated social media stocks
1287 2018-07-29 00:10:46 I mean buying and selling your own stocks that you have personally researched. As opposed to just putting money in a managed fund.
1288 2018-07-29 00:09:43 My preferred trading is short selling so just got to hope those positions do better in recession but stocks don’t always go down during one grabbing Some Vix is nice hedge for non short traders
1289 2018-07-29 00:07:20 I'm on the fence, but leaning towards no sympathy. When you trade options, you are provided with RED ALERT style warnings about the risks, much more than stocks. He violated every basic investing rule (hedge, allocate small % of port to single position, etc.) Caveat Emptor.

1335 2018-07-28 23:26:51 "Savers". Total crazy not to properly define that term. Does one mean people with long term deposit accounts with banks instead of a different asset (e.g. Stocks, Real estate,...)? Why are they so deserving of income for doing absolutely nothing?? Such a strange argument.

1355 2018-07-28 23:09:12 Yeah, for passive those are good choices. Seems like you could save the .04% by just building positions in the underlying stocks. But I hate fees. 
1356 2018-07-28 23:07:38 Wow. And those are the H1 B’s doing that too. No wonder twitter stocks are dropping. They don’t care about the 1st amendment.

1362 2018-07-28 23:01:07 My observation is that the checklist you’ve developed yields a very small list of candidates. Do you use the checklist to compare against stocks that you have on a watch list? Is the checklist something that is strictly adhered to?
1363 2018-07-28 23:00:18 Look at that orange lying frog face. How can anyone take #CrookedTrump seriously or believe any of his #LügenFührer rhetoric?

1388 2018-07-28 22:26:48 Big co. stocks taking huge losses at earnings, housing market slowing down, interest prices rising, gas prices rising, trade tariffs, I can see fear arising in the eyes of investors. When fear runs the market what does this mean? Bear market, recession. It's coming and soon.

1393 2018-07-28 22:21:03 Btw the fact that i'll sell very few stocks of in my house.
1394 2018-07-28 22:20:25 The earnings will decide. After all this the earning sessions. If stocks will show better than expected returns PE will itself decrease. Or vice versa..... Meeting expectations will not be enough they should show extraordinary results....
1395 2018-07-28 22:19:28 @smerconish What's a strong economy? Stock market? 50% of Americans have no stocks. GDP? GDP measures prices. If wages go up, a high GDP is great. 

Q3 GDP, October health insurance prices & layoffs will affect voting most.
1396 2018-07-28 22:19:01 Problem is, if you have a factor like PE that is determined in no small part by the demand for the equity in the first place, stocks will cycle in and out of the factor definition if the strategy is popular enough.

1400 2018-07-28 22:15:40 Erm you don’t remember internet stocks in the late 90s early 2000s?

1403 2018-07-28 22:14:28 Economy is going so well for farmers, Twitler is going to hand out $12 billion in aid to help compensate them for lost markets for corn, soybeans and pork. Ford and GM stocks are tanking. So much winning!

1405 2018-07-28 22:13:51 What is their hidden agenda? Stocks?
1406 2018-07-28 22:13:35 And now, in 2018, the salmon stocks are collapsing.

Coincidental?

It's #Fukushima fallout.
1407 2018-07-28 22:13:09 Nung friday on sale na daw kaya ubos na limited stocks kasi 
1408 2018-07-28 22:12:16 what josh said, plus it’s not like all value ETFs have same strat/hold same stocks, the range is very wide.
1409 2018-07-28 22:11:35 When May talks of Tory's stock-piling, can one assume they're including common and preferred stocks, bonds and gold....?
1410 2018-07-28 22:10:27 Economic slavery is what corporations can't wait to enact on you, and you'll lap it up as "freedom" because if a private entity does the oppression it's okay.

Enjoy your neo feudalism, bye.
1411 2018-07-28 22:09:59 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1412 2018-07-28 22:09:55 Let me also just add the @KatherineRooss is very up to day on gaming and a gamer herself btw! We talk gaming no stocks on a daily basis. So be sure to check out he feed and write ups!
1413 2018-07-28 22:09:28 Economy, dollar, trade key to U.S. stocks' global edge. I didn't know they had any. Is it the cyclical p/e?
1414 2018-07-28 22:09:25 The government helped make mending arms possible.

But don't worry, you pay for it out of pocket either way. It could just be cheaper under socialized medicine.

But hey, you subscribe to the "fuck you got mine" system of economics. What a horrible person you must be.
1415 2018-07-28 22:08:06 Thanks. Good luck chief. I am only short via puts as a cowards way out... and a couple of stocks here and there.
1416 2018-07-28 22:08:01 I’m stunned we’ve got him.
1417 2018-07-28 22:07:22 Being complicit is accepting it. You're okay with bigotry, you just don't want sound like one or admit it. Wrapping it up in "freedom" is nothing short of being okay by an oppressor by another name.

You're obviously priveledged, so you don't care that others are oppressed.
1418 2018-07-28 22:06:51 I took 7 stocks in the Dallas vs Houston crew battle... With 3k people watching on Twitch! Super pleased
Very very good day
1419 2018-07-28 22:05:11 How about the salmon stocks collapsing this year?

There's a story for you.

Test the salmon, & I'm sure you'll find all kinds of #Fukushima fallout, as well as deformities & illness. 

But of course...*crickets* from mainstream media & science.
1420 2018-07-28 22:04:28 Who do you think stocks the shelves?
1421 2018-07-28 22:03:34 anyone wanna admit they have a crush in me before i start investing in activia yogurt stocks
1422 2018-07-28 22:02:27 That's kind of like, "If my stock broker hears privately about a company whose stocks will be falling soon, then encourages me to sell my stocks before the information is public, it's fine because... who wants to be surprised?" Says Martha Stewart.
1423 2018-07-28 22:02:02 Lot of folk sayin lower stocks now..i bet monday tuesday is rip ya face off day !
1424 2018-07-28 22:01:24 oh i did both. for a week they may as well have been in stocks!
1425 2018-07-28 22:00:12 I think stockists are purging their Revell stocks seeing as the parent company went bust recently. Seems it was a @wonderland_mdls stall at Riat.
1426 2018-07-28 22:00:02 The wooden stocks cover his ears, making him deaf  to the warnings to repent. Misfortune will deepen
1427 2018-07-28 21:58:06 @iamcardib dont forget to get some stocks bonds and gold bar certificates while you have money
1428 2018-07-28 21:55:48 Billionaires buy distress and bet asymettrically 
Meaning they buy companies for 25 cents on the dollar and wait till it returns a dollar to sell or they buy out of the money calls on the best growth stocks.
1429 2018-07-28 21:55:37 an ETF Portfolio typically involves owning stocks. What am I missing?
1430 2018-07-28 21:54:45 Or, our government will just buy the social media stocks when they are dirt cheap, and nationalize them/make them transparent along with an internet bill of rights. Just a crazy thought.
1431 2018-07-28 21:53:37 Facebook is corrupt my stocks are solid.   The best thing that has happened to the United States is Trump becoming Potus. Obama was worthless
1432 2018-07-28 21:52:33 Old Navy online stocks the size you're after
1433 2018-07-28 21:49:10 They’re busy scrambling trying to figure out what to do now that they’re being exposed and stocks are plunging.
1434 2018-07-28 21:49:08 Can you please tell me that ryan stocks not being killed off

1439 2018-07-28 21:40:51 @SmithWeekly included a fantastic section on when to get out in their nuke report too, worth the read.. three triggers for me: 
1-when my wife starts following the stocks
2-when I feel like telling people
3-when certain other people start getting interested
1440 2018-07-28 21:39:35 What should be our strategy in such kind of market according to you sir?? Should buy ( offcourse stocks with good fundamentals) or still wait ??
1441 2018-07-28 21:37:48 Then why is 45% of my portfolio ETF’s? Need to find other stocks rather than $tsla $dis $appl please start to branch out in stocks
1442 2018-07-28 21:36:59 U must b low income in the United States i am very successful.  I worked my way thru college made great investments and since Trump took office my stocks have tripled in value.  Unsuccessful ppl want socialism
1443 2018-07-28 21:36:29 Following up here: I shorted this fella a week before earnings around 43+, did some 42/40 risk reversals. Quant was indicating a -5usd move. The move was massive. I covered the stocks, still hold the options :)
1444 2018-07-28 21:33:00 The equivalent of ‘buy now while stocks last!’
1445 2018-07-28 21:32:38 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1446 2018-07-28 21:31:21 One of the first of few stocks I invested in 
1447 2018-07-28 21:24:04 By the ninth you should be free of stocks related thinking 

Cheers
1448 2018-07-28 21:22:48 You have a major in Economics? What do you think about Trump's "great" money policies? Why have stocks (NYSE, NASDAQ) been in the toilet since he came?  I've never seen NYSE & NASDAQ be so consistently DOWN since Trump arrived.
1449 2018-07-28 21:22:30 stocks are down again guys
1450 2018-07-28 21:22:25 That's way less than half the country benefiting from finance capital. Most ppl are not getting a pension anymore, and 401ks largely depend upon high salaries and steady income. Markets, stocks and bonds can also be very volatile as you know.
1451 2018-07-28 21:21:49 The term “suffering” is relative but it is lovely to see stocks tank $115B in one day 
1452 2018-07-28 21:20:49 based on history of MintBroker it will tank. Just a matter of time. I bet SureTrader will have borrows heh. 

Proof: look at the 4k and 3k filings for MintBroker International, Ltd. (0001742576) and look a the stocks for these filings.
1453 2018-07-28 21:20:42 Well I’d start by looking at there stocks.
1454 2018-07-28 21:20:26 Could the S&P500 be rising from FAANG companies buying back their own shares? Volatility =opportunity to make money. Stock market is run on algorithms/is artificial.Millennials aren't entering stocks, who's going to buy them?That's the trend.What r they worth if we dnt wnt them?
1455 2018-07-28 21:20:16 Keep in mind that yesterday should have been a 3% up day with all the news (Amazon beat, GDP, Trade War aversion, etc)- instead stocks fell all session. 

To me, it WAS a failure. Palms out for next 90 days...
1456 2018-07-28 21:19:43 Damir mentioned that as long as a market is liquid these setups should re-occur ..... i decided to trade only a select few of the most heavily traded stocks and indexes and imo its a bit scary how accurate im becoming..... $amzn prime example...the price action played out so well
1457 2018-07-28 21:18:24 He specifically mentions bump stocks more than once, he is not the cunt sir, that’s you. And you literally have NO idea what his trauma was like. None. At all. And I promise he is not missing you as a listener.
1458 2018-07-28 21:15:34 Bon ça se finit quand le désaccord entre Leclerc et coca cola, je vois les stocks de coca s’amenuiser et à côté de ça le « jean’s coca » fleurir : c’est une infamie, ça abime les yeux
1459 2018-07-28 21:15:31 Well actually despite stocks being high and unemployment being low the real wages went down by 9% Or something in the last year's and by almost 2 % since the tax reform. Stocks and employment are not a good metric to measure the state of the economy. Regular people have less.
1460 2018-07-28 21:14:55 So since I keep picking the best stocks that make me money in my 401k lol I opened a broker acct lol let’s see if I could hang with the big boys 
1461 2018-07-28 21:14:41 I love these stocks...Ima make some money on Monday
1462 2018-07-28 21:14:15 I would agree with @The_Big_E. Don't move IRA money re taxes and penalties on some if withdrawn early. Stack cash and buy stocks in chunks.
1463 2018-07-28 21:10:50 I Want To Invest My Money In Stocks
1464 2018-07-28 21:10:17 When the stocks of every other augmentation company crashed, Tai Yong was there to swallow them up.
1465 2018-07-28 21:09:58 Of course not.  They will buy stocks, land, make more loans, etc etc.  but much will go into Treasury bills or treasury notes.  Are they going to sell the dollars they just received to buy euros and then a Eurobond paying .5%?  or just keep dollars paying 3%?
1466 2018-07-28 21:09:54 I can tell you but I don’t want to be considered a smart ass. Wages are lower the money that big businesses got in the tax scam all went to buy more stocks so kept the stock market high. prices have went up because of the trade war. Again I’m not being a smart ass just answered.
1467 2018-07-28 21:09:48 i just saw hooter in the stocks on my feed oh no
1468 2018-07-28 21:09:12 @ahowls good luck, TD has the worst lost of stocks for shorting
1469 2018-07-28 21:08:45 $BABA and Chinese stocks all consolidating now, waiting on the next market bounce and they will bounce hard. Till then sit and wait
1470 2018-07-28 21:07:28 I wonder if in practice, there are more reasons certain stocks are expensive and less reasons why stocks are cheap
1471 2018-07-28 21:07:25 S&P is the data set.  You could certainly apply a momentum screen to value stocks and own a different risk premium outside of pure beta.  Right?
1472 2018-07-28 21:06:06 And then there was the fact the European foodstuff wouldn't grow in the swampy lands they founded the colony in, which means they couldn't establish food stocks for the extreme winter.

Weird huh?
1473 2018-07-28 21:06:03 Well said. Why would you tell your students to trade such a risky stock? But I guess a lot of these “gurus” only trade penny stocks and that’s where all the sheep live.
1474 2018-07-28 21:05:30 Oprah is an ayaanle who trades stocks as a day job.
1475 2018-07-28 21:05:29 Just for a laugh. Sure nothing will happen. 

I found some stocks in the past with even more profound evidences, and nothing happened and nobody cared.
1476 2018-07-28 21:04:32 Stocks?
1477 2018-07-28 21:04:11 How has he failed America jobs are up there's not enough people for the jobs labor board says that stocks are up my stocks are doing great companies have returned to the United States where did he fail???????
1478 2018-07-28 21:03:48 2/ What you want is control over people. To dictate to then what they should have or not. What business they can do. Ban things you dont like.  In short, you are advocating economic slavery to get people to take care of you. That's a no for me.
1479 2018-07-28 21:03:48 I don't know shit about evaluating stocks, like P/E ratio. But, i'm going to be looking to accumulate AMD and Samsung stock over the next year.
1480 2018-07-28 21:01:23 Moonshot to YG: We still have a lot of stocks left. Do we need put it on sale? Do a clearance sale?

1481 2018-07-28 21:01:05 I think I'm addicted in buying Stocks 
1482 2018-07-28 21:00:23 Okay that enough stocks for now. Have good weekend everyone!
1483 2018-07-28 20:57:53 I found it so amusing. A stock option is just the option to *purchase* stocks at a later date. If dude wanted equity he should have demanded just that -- equity in the form of actual preferred stock.
1484 2018-07-28 20:57:30 stocks & bonds .
1485 2018-07-28 20:57:04 This week for market analysis, I'll be checking out the conference call on earnings for these stocks $CAT 7/30 $AAPL 7/31 $RIO Rio Tinto 8/01 $DWDP DowDupont and $BRKB Berkshire Hathaway 8/02
1486 2018-07-28 20:57:01 4% growth - so what? Obama exceeded that at least four times. Meantime #taxscam has given 83% of benefit to 1% and gives republicans an excuse to cut Medicare etc. Jobs/stocks may be good but often better under Obama.

And Obama succeeded without ruining what made America great.
1487 2018-07-28 20:56:56 Once again you show ignorance about Constitutional powers and limitations.  Health care and education is a local issue and a personal one. Science is a national benefit.  Mending your broken arm on my dime isn't.
1488 2018-07-28 20:54:42 It's only complicated if you want it to be.  My family has gone through the immigration olympics. Wasn't fun but respect for the country was paramount.
1489 2018-07-28 20:53:21 And mine! Wonderful words and folk to work with..Happy bunny is Mrs Stocks ..Thank you ! X
1490 2018-07-28 20:52:13 No. We're ok with businesses having freedom of association per the First Amendment.  Leftist enjoying centralized control and force in order to have people do things or engage in things they dont want to do.  Leave them alone. That simple.
1491 2018-07-28 20:49:47 That's true, but even the build-it-yourself steel arms are a risky proposition: it will never be more than noise in the market, and most of the parts come from those same manufacturers.

The main target for immediate regulation is really the auto conversion kits and bump stocks.
1492 2018-07-28 20:48:54 Taxes: taxes on earned income -wages exceed those on investment, rents, cap gains. Lowering of top tax rates, upping inheritance exclusion to over 12 million per person. Sales tax on goods but nothing equivalent on stocks & bonds. no universal healthcare
1493 2018-07-28 20:48:06 And doubtful you pay your fair share of taxes for a system you disproportionately use.  It goes both ways..
1494 2018-07-28 20:45:46 About to go on rant about stocks i watch on these monthly charts almost done. planning for next month.
1495 2018-07-28 20:45:36 To all the super wealthy out there who just got a huge tax break and voted down regulations so you can use it to buy back stocks and not improve the living conditions of the employees responsible for your enormous profits: Eat shit and fuck you.
1496 2018-07-28 20:44:32 There are bass caught sustainably and landed but we are not allowed to cook and sell them. Scallops in the shell are also not permitted. My point was about nonsensical rules not sustainably of stocks
1497 2018-07-28 20:43:05 No evidence yet that Tech is in trouble. Here’s what can be said. Still in ultran strong up trend however severely stretched. By the time you identify this trend is over the stocks will already be down 20%+.
1498 2018-07-28 20:43:01 EU allowed 6 Dutch ships to use this barbaric way of fishing in our waters. As for the preserving the stocks,  check with @fishingforleave , they will tell you all about it.
1499 2018-07-28 20:41:51 Bring back the stocks and humiliate them in public
1500 2018-07-28 20:39:11 yea. that's not going to happen. at least not in straight forward way you describe. etf or no etf, over 10 yrs, individual stocks prices will still be 90% explained by how well the companies grow
1501 2018-07-28 20:38:47 I think he likes those stocks too much 
1502 2018-07-28 20:38:37 Aucune idée pour l'instant comme le site ne fonctionne pas :/ Mais si c'est le cas, des stocks devraient être prévu pour les acheter sur place le jour des concerts ! #Moka
1503 2018-07-28 20:37:03 Might have a trip out your way next week. Could replenish the stocks?
1504 2018-07-28 20:35:51 I’m going to invest heavily in paper straw stocks...
1505 2018-07-28 20:31:29 The huge drops for FB and TWTR, even for doing good things, are interesting. Think it shows how much even "established" tech stocks are based on expectations and futures rather than fundamentals.
1506 2018-07-28 20:30:02 Poverty is unnecessary! #forex #stocks #investment
1507 2018-07-28 20:29:13 but the #Shadowbanning is not a "Thing" i haven't seen a tweet from #45 in weeks unless someone re tweets or i got look at his page. in consolation, #Twitter and #Facebook stocks are literally swirling as they flush (-22% for Twitter) so they are finding censorship doesnt pay.
1508 2018-07-28 20:28:38 Worried about a drop in your stocks next quarter? As if.
1509 2018-07-28 20:28:31 Yo @derekcarrqb you ever trade penny stocks or BB options?
1510 2018-07-28 20:25:42 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
1511 2018-07-28 20:23:27 Wall Street or some stealth startup will figure out a way for us to buy/sell homes like stocks - ICO's for homes :)
1512 2018-07-28 20:22:38 Not true. Human nature. Everyone buys crypto, stocks etc once they are going up. Only the smart people buy when its beaten down.
1513 2018-07-28 20:22:07 (1/2)

Started a study for option traders.

Hypothesis: Tech stocks that have reported earnings within 3 days (before) the onslaught of $FB $GOOGL $AMZN , tend to have too cheaply priced options, so owning a straddle AFTER the earnings event works well do to exogenous factors.
1514 2018-07-28 20:21:55 Except you can't compare stocks to leadership.  Ask the Browns or Lions if they would like to have Elway.  You have to be realistic.  Elway is directly involved in every Bronco Superbowl victory.  I'll live with that, thank you very much.
1515 2018-07-28 20:20:34 That depleted stocks and stores that now have to be replaced.  Inventory numbers are way down
1516 2018-07-28 20:19:36 I've been selling all my stocks in the last week. Too many warning signs to ignore.
1517 2018-07-28 20:19:28 Hey CBS! I challenge you to pick up the Roseanne show!? You may see an INCREASE in your viewers and STOCKS
1518 2018-07-28 20:18:57 Man, Stocks are a weird thing when you think about it.
1519 2018-07-28 20:18:56 exceeding exceptions is only 1/2 the picture.. what did these companies indicate for rest of year (lowering/maintaining guidance, etc).  Maybe there is a new narrative for many of these 'expensive' stocks that people used to be comfortable paying for.
1520 2018-07-28 20:18:28 Twitter stocks have dropped, but I can't foresee them changing.
They don't put in their guidelines it's political 'selective' criteria they use. To me this constitutes fraud.
1521 2018-07-28 20:18:06 No it's not and BTW, it hit that 7 times while Obama was in office and that number doesn't mean anyone's wages or earnings have gone up. Corporate welfare tax cuts resulted in corporations buying their own stocks using the extra cash, not increasing wages or creating new jobs.
1522 2018-07-28 20:15:09 Off to Mexico next weekend to deplete the corona stocks !
1523 2018-07-28 20:14:15 Il doivent écouler les stocks actuel donc en régions Parisienne il y en encore... J'en ai acheté pour 8€ looool mais venez ils la sortent aussi en bouteille comme au grec
1524 2018-07-28 20:13:43 gonna pay attention to cbs stocks next week cuz it'll tank more, lol!
1525 2018-07-28 20:10:49 Ooooh the plot thickens..... stocks a tumbling grounds a shaken what will happen next? Grab the popcorn  sit back a watch the feathers fly
1526 2018-07-28 20:09:45 Já nao é o primeiro artigo que leio sobre isto nas ultimas semanas, é começar a acumular stocks.
1527 2018-07-28 20:08:40 "im going to quit the game because you took away the glitch that gave me more merits, bucks, notices, stocks"

1546 2018-07-28 19:46:51 . Scaremongering at its finest. Said it earlier - think this is OTT.

Reports like this will certainly strain stocks regardless as many (most looking at replies) will stock pile now! Would these companies let such a lucrative market fail? I don’t think so. #GBDoc
1547 2018-07-28 19:46:48 Already in recession imho but for effects of tax cuts. But the primary driver is a crash in stocks of ~30% 1987 style ideally in Oct but could be slightly sooner or later imho. Fed pause and reversal to quickly follow.

1562 2018-07-28 19:31:01 But the key point is still, only Democratic Presidents have administered the Budget in a manner that reduces the Deficit while the Repubs love creating Debt because it flows into stocks which rise and create "phony" wealth for the already well to do
1563 2018-07-28 19:30:33 For this reason I have stopped trading penny stocks . Absolutely no risk control. I’ve seen way to much of this dump stuff past four months. Moved on to Earnings and morning gaps.... same 50 cents -1$ profits.... no dumps .. so far.
1564 2018-07-28 19:30:31 REIT shares are stocks, not direct ownership of real estate.  Fractional direct ownership of RE is legally restricted to Accredited/wealthy in US.  There is more retail syndication outside of US.  I could also explain why retail aggregation at scale moves the needle.

1571 2018-07-28 19:24:58 I'm seeing very little change. For those that have any investment in individual stocks, they are seeing a benefit since companies prefer buybacks over capex. Curious how your budget is going to work over 10 years with less income too? You complained at dems for overspending FYI.

1573 2018-07-28 19:24:21 Find a brokerage, preferably one with low commission costs and you can begin putting money in your bank account into that broker and you can invest or have someone manage the money for you. Overtime as stocks/funds/bonds go up, so will your money.

1580 2018-07-28 19:19:33 Selling a stock is hard. We sell when we need to rebalance, when we need to trim a position or when we make a mistake or find something we think is better. That said, we fully expect that the stocks we sold or trimmed will continue to go higher.

1585 2018-07-28 19:15:24 There's a number of decent plays still to be had (Oil, esp. stocks w/ high dividends), but Trump totally killed the rally that was happening. You can draw a clear line back to him threatening Amazon earlier this year. That hit Micron, Amazon. Couple that w/ FBs problems. Bad news
1586 2018-07-28 19:15:08 its going to be gapping up, bulls will come charging. then there will be other sympathy stocks in play as well.
1587 2018-07-28 19:14:52 1. People noticing/laughing/rejoicing about Facebook & Twitter stocks falling are not considering the big picture. These companies offer so much more value to The Enemies of Freedom than 'stock prices'.

So far I own a small amount of ENTI, APRU and AAGC. These 3 you spoke about. 

I understand there are no promises in stocks. However I like to follow your lead if you don't mind.

Thank you Boss
1595 2018-07-28 19:09:51 I agree 100% that CEO's should only make a certain % above the next guy in line and so on. Sure, they can make more if they own stocks in their company and they do well, but their base salary should not be in the millions while their employees starve. I am 100% with you on that!

1607 2018-07-28 18:57:05 Looking at some of the growth momentum stocks like $ZEN $HUBS $NEWR $PANW $GDDY, it seems to me that they need to consolidate and build a base. By the looks of it, it seems like they've started to do so. 

Alot of similar stocks have already done that, and is ready to fly.
1608 2018-07-28 18:54:57 Sir, all major stocks have seen decrease in open interest. What's your view on that ?
1609 2018-07-28 18:53:17 Agree.  Lots of peeps start by trading penny stocks, tho - from catching the fever from Furu’s/Guru’s (what’s the appropriate name? lol).

Please name one thing that Trump has fixed with this trade war?
Using 12b from my money doesn't count
1662 2018-07-28 18:20:10 Gold chart and #bitcoin chart r basically  same chart for months now I wonder how many ppl in crypto realize this and/or even look at regular stocks ETFs commodities etc.....
1663 2018-07-28 18:19:22 They certainly too my stocks and others too. The was such a big scam from the start but profitable for the coffers to be plundered. I just want my measly pittance back
1664 2018-07-28 18:18:53 Gotta unload Twitter/FB stocks b4 it free falls once the results of investigation results come out, IMO
1665 2018-07-28 18:18:10 Debt acts as a wet blanket on growth and our debt/deficits haven't been reduced, but are actually getting bigger.

Trump even said while campaigning that we have a massive bubble (true) in everything (stocks, real estate..all risk assets).

The bubble is even bigger now.
1666 2018-07-28 18:17:58 Every time I type in $AWX I get "Did you mean $wax?" No autocorrect I didn't #stocks
1667 2018-07-28 18:17:19 Help to get @Twitter to stop the #Shadowban!  Go to every #promoted tweet and let them know that you do not plan on clicking their product until they help the ban removed!   Together we can #BeatTheBan - or we watch stocks tumble!
1668 2018-07-28 18:16:35 Imo it is really great! Most of the stocks in it are 
1669 2018-07-28 18:16:33 shoddy dude to hold stocks on your behalf if stocks are represented as blockchain tokens. With tokens, you are in charge of holding security.
If you're from a country which gives its citizens a lot of economic freedom, this is not particularly relevant to you -- although, perhaps
1670 2018-07-28 18:14:45 Young investors avoided stocks in the 1940s and after watching their parents get wiped out in the 1930s; it happened again in the 1980s after the turbulent 1970s, and it’s happening now, a decade after the financial crisis. Seeing parents get crushed has that effect.
1671 2018-07-28 18:13:00 Down $20k on my stocks. ORPN needs to step it up
1672 2018-07-28 18:10:58 Hey Zippy, tell us why you think stocks plunged...

1675 2018-07-28 18:08:51 Well, until recent changes in regulations, it was basically impossible for a Ukrainian citizen to buy stocks abroad legally due to measures called "capital controls". They are highly unfair and ineffective as people who have significant amount of capital can easily move it
1676 2018-07-28 18:08:31 Thats why i invest in stocks of ammunition companies
1677 2018-07-28 18:08:12 Dummies. Investing in FAANG stocks will make you better off, at least until this week.
1678 2018-07-28 18:07:02 twitter randomly deciding that I can't like a piece of Godzilla concept art who's the real monster you blue piece of shit website I hope your stocks crash
1679 2018-07-28 18:06:03 No Guarantee that these stocks will build wealth over 2 decades. What happened to NIIT  & APTECH which were ruling 20 yrs back. ?

1682 2018-07-28 18:04:40 examples: ranno arrogates my stocks eevery game
1683 2018-07-28 18:04:32 I tried a filter of that sort (something similar to @safalniveshak suggests (sincere gratitude to him)) and applied a self-defined margin of safety, and it threw exactly 4 stocks, conventionally overvalued...quality seems irrationally expensive!
1684 2018-07-28 18:02:16 NVDA is one of my favorite stocks, and I have traded it since it was under $100... I do not own it currently... That may change. I like the set-up...
1685 2018-07-28 18:01:44 Actually many working people have 401k.
And you really don’t have to be wealthy to invest in stocks.
1686 2018-07-28 18:01:44 Precious metals not stocks guess who controls the stock market America
1687 2018-07-28 18:01:29 I agree and only think things with "true value" are things that can be used and bartered with in the coming years. Food, water, ammo, shelter and so on. I think all this gold, silver, BTC, stocks all of it is a cash cow and nothing more in the Whole picture...
1688 2018-07-28 17:57:09 All hype and lies. Are you honestly saying that pharmaceutical companies will not be interested in the BILLIONS of pounds of stocks that are ordered and in a constant supply chain? I wonder if the people saying this are against brexit by any chance. Project fear, ignore this BS

1695 2018-07-28 17:51:45 His personal stocks lost that much. Total “losses” were $123 billion.
1696 2018-07-28 17:51:21 Foreign here, but: Please don't get rid of Trump just yet. The US stocks in my portfolio are the only ones doing anything for me!
1697 2018-07-28 17:50:11 I continue to search for value plays for 2nd half yr. I don't want to chase breakouts or overvalued speculation moves. Markets should head higher, cause what is going to stop them, but not comfortable holding many individual stocks. Great market for daytrading though-wish I could
1698 2018-07-28 17:49:51 Utility companies should not be publicly traded. Consumers have no choice but to support them, and a conflict between shareholder/customer priorities arises with exec strategy. Companies w some of the worst power quality have well performing stocks
1699 2018-07-28 17:49:27 You are the man, thank you so much for taking the time answering my question.  I had a hunch the mining industry recently adopted this method.  This information confirms my suspicion that markets are not interpreting or applying these numbers constructively to PM stocks.
1700 2018-07-28 17:48:06 2. Eliminate the artificial & arbitrary 'ceiling' above which high-income earners  pay NO MORE into Social Security.
Also subject 'passive earnings' (stocks, commodity futures, etc.) to regular S.S. taxes.
1701 2018-07-28 17:46:11 Agree. So just reverse it.
1702 2018-07-28 17:45:51 So true. You could see the hate when nflx and fb failed to dazzle last week. It's as if half my Twitter feed was happy these stocks went down.
1703 2018-07-28 17:44:06 Yun lang yung design. Haha ayun lang, pagkabalik ko kanina sa nbs ubos na yung stocks. Bigla nawala dun sa display
1704 2018-07-28 17:43:37 Stock market futures rose modestly vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.4%, fueled by Amazon. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.3%. Dow Jones futures advanced 0.1%, as losses by Dow Jones stocks Intel and Exxon Mobil (XOM) curbed blue-chip gains.
1705 2018-07-28 17:43:10 Tip of the Iceberg: This is a bigger part of actually bringing Twitter and Facebook down. We will destroy their trust, crash their stocks, bury them in litigation then arrest the top people for corruption and much worse charges after they are exposed and we have the source codes.
1706 2018-07-28 17:42:26 QE = Creating currency (nowadays via electrons) to buy stuff. We used to call it "monetization." Most Central Banks now do it, buying debt; some buy stocks. Supply/demand: more demand for bonds, rates go lower. More demand for stocks, stocks higher. Destroys true price discovery.
1707 2018-07-28 17:42:16 Stock market futures rose modestly early Friday morning, with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures up as Amazon .com (AMZN) and Intel (INTC) headlined a busy lineup of leading stocks moving overnight.
1708 2018-07-28 17:41:56 Well public stocks,with free rotten eggs & fruit & a summery notice board of the offence close to the stocks.Police officer present allowing public to ask offender why they committed the crime before pelting them with fruit.What crime figures fall then dramatically overnight.
1709 2018-07-28 17:41:41 IBD's Medical-Products industry group is ranked first out of 197 groups tracked. Edwards stock is on the IBD Big Cap 20 list. Other medtech stocks like Abiomed (ABMD), Align Technology (ALGN) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) are listed on the IBD 50.
1710 2018-07-28 17:41:17 Any real investments in life take a couple years to reap profits. Get on petty stocks if you want something quick.
1711 2018-07-28 17:41:15 After Parkland, the Republican legislature passed laws including banning bump stocks, a red flag law, raised rifle purchases from 18 to 21 (with exceptions) to match hand gun age, 3 day waiting period for gun sales & money for added school security.  The NRA is suing Florida.
1712 2018-07-28 17:40:52 Edwards stock to tumble 8.5%, to 141.87, on the stock market today. Broader medical technology stocks dipped 2.3%. Mussallem said. "We have maintained price discipline and ceded share to competitors who have chosen to price aggressively in this region."
1713 2018-07-28 17:40:29 Facebook stocks plunged by 19% could see this coming serious rapid decline in the use of it bar a few aul one's

1716 2018-07-28 17:37:01 Yet foreign investors could end up banned from entering the US just for putting money into pot stocks...wtf??
1717 2018-07-28 17:37:00 It was an irresponsible tax cut to begin with, sir.
1718 2018-07-28 17:35:59 Facebook and Twitter stocks absolutely plummeted, really because of the effectiveness of hackers and trolls and cyber warfare. This should really concern all of us.
1719 2018-07-28 17:35:49 wish I could be there......but live in the land

1723 2018-07-28 17:33:23 Pump and dump. Always with penny stocks. Looked like a great opportunity to get in flxn here
1724 2018-07-28 17:32:16 What part of "all ETF portfolio" and "owning stocks" did you not understand??
1725 2018-07-28 17:31:17 And you have. You gave these "forgotten" ones a 40% corporate tax cuts (they all own stocks), tax cuts for the rich (they are all rich), less environmental and consumer protection, graft and abuse by the administration, and aid and comfort to treason, since that's "patriotism"
1726 2018-07-28 17:30:07 No worries, I don’t buy stocks I have to check everyday, so I’m not concerned in the least. 
1727 2018-07-28 17:29:58 May have record low unemployment, but when are those million $$ tax cuts given to the ultra rich going to start trickling down to the people who desperately need it?  No time soon since they're busy buying back their own stocks.  SO SAD!
1728 2018-07-28 17:28:48 Traded with u a couple times - dropped $12 on Thursday in 3 stocks - does that count lol
1729 2018-07-28 17:28:13 He holds many stocks. Tesla for sure he holds a lot. He parks his money in quality stocks

1736 2018-07-28 17:23:44 Funny all the pump and dump stocks talked about with $drys ticker attatched to the conversation of another stock.

 $drys might blow short sellers balloon knott thrue their brains here again this coming November from the rappid #bdi rise it's on the Verge of.
1737 2018-07-28 17:23:24 Equity is essentially a play on growth though. You will always make sub optimal returns if you buy stocks just for undervaluation and sell them when they are fairly valued.

1740 2018-07-28 17:22:33 5 FAANG stocks collectively now have a whopping market capitalization of $4 trillion.

They comprise nearly half of the NASDAQ index's market cap.

FAANGs are the largest five companies in the S&P. And they were responsible for ALL of that index's growth over the first six months
1741 2018-07-28 17:20:25 It was all over MSNBN already. Along with the stock market gains. Old new anyways. I paid attention. I have a retirement and  stocks.  hussane  said Mr. Trump would need a majic wand to get to 4%.  It was maybe at 1.8 then.  2.6 for the muzzie at best. Then it went back  down

1747 2018-07-28 17:17:18 Im just lookin out for your stocks bro. But if thats how u feel #AllGoodie
1748 2018-07-28 17:16:50 @porinju @VijayKedia1 @StocksResearch @AnilSinghviZEE @CNBC_Awaaz the recent correction is showing transformation Investing minds from Quantity  to Quality stocks.Recovery in Good quality Mid / Small Cap will be much faster than chor companies
1749 2018-07-28 17:15:37 Yes no respect whatsoever now & if the little darlings are caught nothing will happen. I suggest we bring back the stocks & do the same to them
1750 2018-07-28 17:15:34 So it seems like #Faang is over and it’s more #MAGA!
But not Trumps MAGA this time, instead it’s Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon.
Make tech stocks great again!
1751 2018-07-28 17:14:06 Peach petals look pretty similar to rose petals, I'm pretty sure there would be some usable stocks there, just need to color them pink 
1752 2018-07-28 17:13:55 That's what makes a market. Sometimes momentum goes with you....sometimes goes the other way.

As @jimcramer says....mispriced stocks=buying opportunity.
1753 2018-07-28 17:13:12 Thank you! I did that and it was Yummy! Now need to find somewhere that stocks your lentil and kale tart...
1754 2018-07-28 17:12:33 It's a naive question, but this "shelf" it's the same as outstanding stocks?
1755 2018-07-28 17:12:30 remember I said, if I was going to sell you a pair of red socks...they would be 100% red guarantee, not 99.999999999%. And, my socks are not at a trillion stocks/shares value

....just saying.
1756 2018-07-28 17:11:14 Bump stocks are nothing. You can easily get the same result without spending money. Hell, just feathering gives the same result lol
1757 2018-07-28 17:10:30 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',
1758 2018-07-28 17:10:07 I wanted to do that originally but was unable to find any good stocks for it that didn't pixelate upon usage, or fit the theme at all, so I defaulted to the peaches from her Peach Blossom Final Smash ;w;
1759 2018-07-28 17:08:45 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
1760 2018-07-28 17:07:58 $DPW  shorts- story is chapter 1 Runaway bull 4garbage stocks !realityR 65 mil+ shs OUT!Plenty of stock! Name me a firm that short stock@.50
1761 2018-07-28 17:05:24 can you bring in more stocks for your tshirts next time, pestle and mortar  @pestlenmortar
1762 2018-07-28 17:04:57 If Trump replaces Ginsey, cyanide stocks will soar to the heavens, but it will only be a temporary spike, as I doubt their customers will return for more.
1763 2018-07-28 17:03:16 can you explain why it's 'clearly' superior? just because it's not as good of a return on investment? the 20% drop in FB probably scares alot of people from owning individual stocks
1764 2018-07-28 17:02:02 Which sectors and stocks are the highest conviction bets for you?
1765 2018-07-28 17:01:48  SUMMER SALE! 

Our Lily Relax Double set was £189 but is now only £169! It comes flat packed and there is a delivery service available! Get your extremely comfortable summer seat while stocks last 
1766 2018-07-28 17:01:31 Yes, yes, he's a total rat. No shortage of info out there to prove that, which might make him the perfect mole

So we see him investigating Trump on Twitter, then Twitter catches the ire of Trump. Twitter stocks drop and Q talks regulating

Not sure I buy all the coincidences
1767 2018-07-28 17:01:06 probably how gentile targets his next pump finding stocks that can't be diluted
1768 2018-07-28 16:59:08 That's correct. We have service centres across our network that can provide stocks to the train as the crew require, and in the event of a disruption incident then the Train Manager will dispense drinks through the train as required. ^AG
1769 2018-07-28 16:59:08 Okay then why did Trump give our tax cuts a sunset of 2021 but no sunset for corporate tax cuts? 85% of corporations used their tax cuts to buy back their own stocks; not boosting wages or creating jobs. Who knew? Lol
1770 2018-07-28 16:58:54 By the way. Owning stocks is clearly superior to an all ETF portfolio. ETF robos are basically tricycles. Poorly built tricycles.
1771 2018-07-28 16:57:04 TRUMP IS ADDING $1.7TRILLION TO TO THE DEBT OVER TEN YEARS. ILLEGALS ALONE ARE $1.4TRILLION, WALL $13B DUHHH, BUT TRUMPS ECONOMY HAS ADDED OVER $7 TRIL IN STOCK VALUE, ALL AMERICANS WHO WORK OWN STOCKS IN 401K, IN 18 MONTHS! WE NEED TO SHIP USELESS PEOPLE BACK TO HOME COUNTRY
1772 2018-07-28 16:54:02 Why does the EU currently control our access to stockpiles of supplies the UK has bought necessitating transferring them here or building up separate stocks? There’s some odd stances in there. Understand the daft side, but also look at the more serious hoarding controls here.
1773 2018-07-28 16:53:05 1 day of IK's leadership and stocks of shot up! Dollar's rate has decreased, gold's rates have decreased!

ALHUMDULILLAH!! Pakistan did it!!! AFTER NEARLY 71 YEARS!!
1774 2018-07-28 16:49:35 Buy high, sell low strategy for portion of mining stocks.  Brilliant, Vanguard.
1775 2018-07-28 16:47:46 ...so the sons having a bbq
with light showers thrown in for free & he's had a drink  wants me to take his £50 to the pub to replenish stocks.
1776 2018-07-28 16:47:28 This little tournament I'm playing in is 3 stocks and the TO almost made it best 1/1 LOL
What's going on here
1777 2018-07-28 16:46:28 The "investment" you refer to is corporations buying up their own stocks, wildly enriching the owners.  The money is not trickling down to employees.
1778 2018-07-28 16:45:43 You've been around long and you know what I know. The sharks that move this one (including funds and central banks) will sell like there is no tomorrow when some deep pocket makes mistake to buy. This is the game, and collusion is part of it. I stay away from exponential stocks.
1779 2018-07-28 16:45:38 No it will not. The same way that right now the entire world market (stocks, bonds, ...) don't move up and down with US$. You are just delusional.
1780 2018-07-28 16:45:23 You lucky people! Chocolate avocado pudding ready to serve with fresh whipped cream (or vegan without). Available while stocks last - time to hit up the bus!! @ Caseros Taco Bus
1781 2018-07-28 16:43:48 Appreciez Donc Macron, francais jamais contents, ici en angleterre avec le desastre du Brexit, on nous recommende de faire des stocks de provisions longue duree, Mrs May completement folle
1782 2018-07-28 16:43:31 If you look at Google, Apple, Twitter stocks any big companies in regulated markets you rarely see this shit. 

Much more liquidity, far less jagged patterns. 

It's been argued you shouldn't even use ta on alts. Not sure I agree entirely but I get where they're coming from.
1783 2018-07-28 16:42:56 When these stocks move big its more than likely insider information which is legal for elected senate and congress yet illegal for us
1784 2018-07-28 16:42:30 Guess who’s stocks will be next to go down!

1786 2018-07-28 16:42:12 My point is that government shouldn’t be involved in retirement planning at all. Your retirement is your responsibility. This is not 1945. It is so easy and cheap to invest in mutual funds, ETFs, and stocks. Government pension plans are a joke... like most government ran programs
1787 2018-07-28 16:41:27 Will a Trade War With China Hurt Tech Stocks?

The technology sector has been one of the S&P 500's best-performers, up 14 percent year-to-date, and until now, tech appears mostly unscathed by the rattling of trade war sabers between the U.S. and China. Parts of the U.S. tech…
1788 2018-07-28 16:41:14 Real estate is going to be cheaper just like last time, As far as stocks companies who have solid assets and business practices but don’t have a lot of fluff valuation due to the market being sky high will be good to invest in just like last time.
1789 2018-07-28 16:39:39 Lying Ass-Face!
1790 2018-07-28 16:38:23 Buy a multi-family complex to rent out, start a business, and invest in stocks.
1791 2018-07-28 16:37:37 Crypto is all fragile at the moment,so best thing to do is vest all 70% profits can't stay,it's not a good investment path for new traders who set out to make money here trade the stocks ,FX and other investment institutions
1792 2018-07-28 16:35:46 Damn Facebook stocks down 16 billion sheesh
1793 2018-07-28 16:35:37 if theyre so confident in their product they should be buying their own coins then. Kind of like how stocks are bought back by their own company when that company sees the stock as too cheap. smh... fuking scams i swear

الله يوفقك 
1795 2018-07-28 16:33:03 Thank you so much @emmerdale for introducing Matty Barton (@Ash_Palmo) & Ryan Stocks (@jamesmooreactor). They’re both amazing characters. Love their personalities, they are both so full of fun & both have a great sense of humour. Ash & James are true talents. 
1796 2018-07-28 16:32:11 Oh good grief.  Unreal is right, now United Airlines management has lost their left loving minds.  3-2-1 - stocks going going gone!  Idiots, when are they going to realize who their paying customers are?
1797 2018-07-28 16:31:13 Yes I agree that’s why I don’t believe I’ve ever had a bottom drawer stock as I continue to monitor them along with my other stocks.
1798 2018-07-28 16:29:51 The step-up incentivizes inefficient allocation of resources beyond just real estate. For example, slow- or no-growth stocks in legacy industries. That capital could be deployed elsewhere to stimulate growth.
1799 2018-07-28 16:28:49 China look like socialist, but is actually capitalist market economy with stocks and multibillion corporations. They knew that socialism will NOT survive.

1802 2018-07-28 16:22:49 For those working in bigger corporations, have you taken advantage of your company’s stocks and shares scheme yet?
1803 2018-07-28 16:22:19 What about stocks? 
What about feeling? 
What about all the things that make life worth living?

HAHAHAHA
1804 2018-07-28 16:21:45 Es evidente que aumentar stocks para tener un colchón mientras te adaptas costaría dinero, y adivinamos que si el gobierno no les obliga probablemente no lo hicieran. Más allá de eso no sacas nada en limpio
1805 2018-07-28 16:20:19 Things that make me mad in financial discourse:

1) People comparing stocks and flows 
2) People using the household analogy at a federal level
3) People claiming capital gains taxes are double taxation
1806 2018-07-28 16:20:09 Most of the pharma stocks under performed Nifty for the last one and half years. The outlook for the industry looks bright and on a whole the sector is expected to grow between 10-15% yearly, revenues are going to gain momentum in the coming quarters.
1807 2018-07-28 16:19:43 *Facebook stock drops 18% in a day*

Bitcoin fans: haha stocks are a bubble anyone who invests in them is a moron 

*Bitcoin price drops 37% in 2 days* 

Bitcoin fans: its actually so good,
1808 2018-07-28 16:18:50 Congratulations, @Snapchat, you played yourself. Usership and stocks have plummeted since that trash update.

1813 2018-07-28 16:17:00 Benjamin Dover has asked the management in his tweet 19h ago and he received the message" a significant portion of their wealth is in stocks".
1814 2018-07-28 16:16:05 Little pricks. Maybe reintroducing stocks is an option?
1815 2018-07-28 16:15:01 The Indian cotton market will try to work it’s way over very tight ending stocks. No real downtrend for at-least next 4.5 months from now. To those who are hoping for an early harvesting pressure, keep waiting.
1816 2018-07-28 16:14:16 There Stocks should drop like bag of rocks @UNITEDA1RLINES
1817 2018-07-28 16:13:57 I was wondering about that myself. Mark mentions he's seen stocks gap down (overnight I presume) 80% and I believe him. But what's the largest intraday gap down you guys have seen?   Day trading is the way to go as far as minimizing risk! I worry about a flash crash though..
1818 2018-07-28 16:13:23 They are even blocking and banning people with small followings. It’s bs and FB stocks just tumbled because of it ....and T w i t just took a 20% hit. They will lose lose lose if they insist upon denying US our right to free speech.
1819 2018-07-28 16:12:55 It's a good thing I spent $180 on 700 shares of $HMNY so that it could be reduced 3 total shares after the reverse split and worth a whopping $6. What a worthless bunch of idiots.

I hope they all burn in bankruptcy hell. Yes, I'm salty. #Stocks #NASDAQ

1821 2018-07-28 16:10:50 Are there possibilities of having stocks for the same or might you be having ETR for the same?
1822 2018-07-28 16:10:05 The stocks come to mind as a way to give practical understanding to these thoughtlessly cruel youths.
1823 2018-07-28 16:10:03 Oh drat. I couldn't fight you, my friend, for the limited stocks. I'll stockpile eclairs and morphine and go out in a sugar-opioid bomb whilst watching Poldark.

1832 2018-07-28 16:03:25 IRA, 401k, stocks, bonds and assets...people with these are the true ballers; all the other stuff I keep seeing is temporary flashy ignorance with no future. Anybody can be an ignorant hustler 
1833 2018-07-28 16:02:18 Good luck Tony and the gang and keep us posted !
1834 2018-07-28 16:02:08 I don't dig as often, but there's a local shop that stocks a lot of classics, typically used. Be hard pressed to find anything under $20 in that shop. It's ridiculous.
1835 2018-07-28 16:01:24 Bastards. Let’s bring back the stocks put them in there & give them a taste of their own medicine

1840 2018-07-28 15:57:18 Weekly $btc chart. RSI just broke 50, MACD crossing. Last time this happened was April 2017! Start your engines! I love #crypto and #blochain stocks, their charts are great!!!
1841 2018-07-28 15:57:15 They need putting in stocks in the Market Place !!!! Then let them have it big time, but no “The Do Gooders” wouldn’t allow it !!!
1842 2018-07-28 15:56:23 Best stalkers in the land
1843 2018-07-28 15:56:17 $IWM closed below 8 EMA weekly. Not a good sign for #trading #stocks.
1844 2018-07-28 15:55:27 Bad enough people are checking their portfolios and dumping Twitter and Facebook stocks.
1845 2018-07-28 15:54:09 In other words, like you I also "call it like I see it"; I just happen to "bet money like I see it" too. If I didn't "see it" like I'm "calling/betting it" I'd take off the bet. After all, there are thousands of stocks out there, and plenty of other asset classes too.
1846 2018-07-28 15:53:36 No #stocks on my focus watchlist for next week. Will watch the market and wait patiently.
1847 2018-07-28 15:53:35 These were the questions.
1. Where's the fitting room?
2. Where can I find the jacket displayed through the window?
3. Do you have stocks of this? (pointing at the pants I already checked)
Since I knew the answers, I took ownership.
1848 2018-07-28 15:53:02 I was thinking about that. The risk of halt is real. 3 stocks in a roll....thats weird. Get me the same feeling of that they LFIN CEO went to tv. He's too much exposed. Small account, small size for sure.
1849 2018-07-28 15:51:53 Yep.. Intelligent people see the true fascists #Fakebook is and want to disassociate themselves from the #Fakebook organization, thus selling stocks and getting as far away from them as possible!  Smart personal & smart political move.
Good riddance #Fakebook
1850 2018-07-28 15:51:29 Barron's still bullish on FANG stocks.
1851 2018-07-28 15:50:35 When it comes to #Facebook on 7/28/18. Nobody likes Mark Zuckerberg,he don't even like himself starting into a mirror like an Evil Queen chasing Snow White. His stocks dropping fast,match his actual popularity amongst real ppl not AI Avatars. #Tech #BREAKING 11:50AM
1852 2018-07-28 15:47:57 Trips for business of his children. We shouldn't be paying for those tax cuts for the rich to profit and buy back stocks either. We should be investing in infrastructure, schools, securing our elections, and safety nets. And we shouldn't pay for sexual assaulters in gov't,
1853 2018-07-28 15:47:50 I agree 100% one of my teachers dedicated an entire period to “educating” her class about bump stocks instead of actually teaching
1854 2018-07-28 15:46:45 When it comes to #Facebook on 7/28/18. Nobody likes Mark Zuckerberg,he don't even like himself starting into a mirror like an Evil Queen chasing Snow White. His stocks dropping fast,match his actual popularity amongst real ppl not AI Avatars. #Tech #BREAKING 11:47AM

1856 2018-07-28 15:45:59 But I know you’re focused on more important issues, such as ensuring Americans still have access to bump stocks, so that their semiautomatic rifles can fire faster.
1857 2018-07-28 15:44:58 Today 10% increase from that day, Great share choose.
1858 2018-07-28 15:44:46 Did I miss any dives in social media stocks that censor conservatives today?
1859 2018-07-28 15:44:10 No it means stocks stocks stocks.
1860 2018-07-28 15:43:41 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
1861 2018-07-28 15:41:17 looking at our cows and ewes and matching to winter stocks = less cows and ewes, bigger kill this back end drop off in production over the next two to four years?

1863 2018-07-28 15:40:00 All these new skincare products are giving us the urge to go back to japan just to hoard stocks.

By us, i meant my whole family

On their flight home, they had one excess baggage, because of shopping.

Who knew that wasnt enough 
1864 2018-07-28 15:39:55 Fuck I just remembered stocks is for boys and class is for men
1865 2018-07-28 15:39:29 Won't be there but watching Eurosport with mates. Stocks of Asahi and Japanese snacks to get us through, but sadly, no t-shirts. Epic!
1866 2018-07-28 15:39:25 When it comes down to who is more mature on #SocialMedia running a business on 7/28/18. Mark Zuckerberg #Facebook or Jack Dorsey #Twitter? 1. FB is in toilet w/plummeting stocks and MZ is a wet diaper baby. Dorsey created another company already.  11:40AM #BreakingNews
1867 2018-07-28 15:39:14 20 or so. . If 90% equity is in 20 stocks then consider 'other equities' as 21st stock with 10% weightage as they have very less impact on ur portfolio anyways. . ( 20 is not a Thumb-rule , just a guide . Get it ? )
1868 2018-07-28 15:39:04 I think there are many people that focus on LT performance for stocks without focusing on LT for the portfolio. For example, if a LT thesis on a stock is broken you should sell the stock and not hold it LT.
1869 2018-07-28 15:38:34 When it comes down to who is more mature on #SocialMedia running a business on 7/28/18. Mark Zuckerberg #Facebook or Jack Dorsey #Twitter? 1. FB is in toilet w/plummeting stocks and MZ is a wet diaper baby. Dorsey created another company already.  11:39AM
1870 2018-07-28 15:38:29 Unlike you, I don’t talk my book because I don’t trade stocks long or short. I call it as I see it and people have every right to agree or disagree with me. You’re the one going off the rails by dictating your own self-interested finwit rules. $TSLA $OSTK
1871 2018-07-28 15:37:43 Once again demonstrating your utter lack of business acumen - your #TaxScam has been a failure.  Businesses are not reinvesting their windfall into hiring or the businesses in other ways, they are paying it out in dividends, buying back stocks and/or increasing exec salaries.
1872 2018-07-28 15:37:20 When it comes down to who is more mature on #SocialMedia running a business on 7/28/18. Mark Zuckerberg #Facebook or Jack Dorsey #Twitter? 1. FB is in toilet w/plummeting stocks and MZ is a wet diaper baby. Dorsey created another company already.  11:38AM
1873 2018-07-28 15:36:04 Now I just pull the flower stocks when they start to form (always) and the leaves when I’m feeling energetic. I haven’t found digging works. The teeniest thread of a root will start a new plant.
1874 2018-07-28 15:35:54 Facebook and Twitter both got their stocks pummeled this week...and Wall Street analysts chastised them for (I am not making this up) "prioritizing fixing their platform over user growth."

THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

1876 2018-07-28 15:35:08 Pretty damn clear if your read the article. He’s against the NRA fighting legislation against bump stocks, strengthening background checks, & requiring background checks on all firearm sales (aka ‘the gun show loophole’) all of which is supported by the vast majority of Americans
1877 2018-07-28 15:35:07 Yup
You sure do
1878 2018-07-28 15:34:09 Nobody wants to hurt us, we shall stop fighting invisible enemies and we shall stop all these negative emotions!

These are problems of another nature, firms who import this stuff would need to have custom declarations etc

With good planning and some stocks this could be sorted!

1880 2018-07-28 15:33:07 The economy 99% of all media talk about is the "skin in the game " economy - those investing in stocks, bonds, etc. It's called capitalism because it's about making, maximizing,  protecting capital. Most jobs don't pay enough to get in that arena
1881 2018-07-28 15:32:39 So the rally is neither broadbased in terms of stocks nor fully participated in terms of money or HNIs or retail... It's not the kind of trend which remains overbought for months together?
1882 2018-07-28 15:32:07 If stocks don’t fall, there will be no buy and hence no sell. The stock shall automatically tumble. so why to fumble Sir? #TheRelationalThinking.

Listen to your own economic numbers: Can you afford good healthcare for
1888 2018-07-28 15:29:08 I suspect bios and other growth stocks are about to get messy for a few months.
1889 2018-07-28 15:28:49 Buy stocks
1890 2018-07-28 15:28:17 I've been trying to get my head around how this works I realise its the price of stocks -$168 bill but did that $168 b just vanish ,did it go elsewhere or did it exist in the first place?
1891 2018-07-28 15:27:15 I live in FL, this has nothing to do with Trayvon or Marissa, this is a ban on bump stocks due to Parkland. SYG is still law here, a white man just murdered a BM in a parking dispute and went home.
1892 2018-07-28 15:27:01 Was stopped out of $AXGN. A lot of these growth stocks are getting hit hard. Red flag for the Naz?
1893 2018-07-28 15:25:59 Still holding $UDOW from 200d three weeks ago.

1895 2018-07-28 15:24:22 No tweeterwss based on a free exchange of unfiltered ideas. That is why the masses signed up. It was not advertised liberal views only. 

The truth is cratering their stocks.

1896 2018-07-28 15:24:20 We regularly provide complimentary water if temperatures reach high levels on-board (for example if the a/c is struggling) where stocks are available. Network Rail have also started to provide water stations on their concourses. ^AG
1897 2018-07-28 15:22:54 @dkalra81 your knowledge on various topics is amazing. Some information you provide on stocks and market, we don't find in any forum.

1899 2018-07-28 15:21:35 i think future engineers should invent electric stocks that can be used at time like this
1900 2018-07-28 15:20:13 @RodFrank12 @btonita Lets get factual,correct data. I just read article in @ShPk_News on RR231 crossing. 35 trains a day, I wish cause it would help my Rail stocks.I spent 25 years designing every train over that public crossing, not sure where you got data but way less then that
1901 2018-07-28 15:19:05 Question for you guys - how is ETC for locating HTB stocks? From what I understand they are not as good as vision or wedbush, but are they significantly better than IB? IB does not let you locate borrows unless you have a $110K margin account.
1902 2018-07-28 15:18:44 Ahhh okay. I thought you meant that you had it sitting in low volatile stocks. Thanks for the reply.
1903 2018-07-28 15:18:37 Stocks like Facebook and Twitter in my view are nothing more than trades not long term investments. They don't build anything they don't produce capital goods they're not a bank they don't make software just Puff.
1904 2018-07-28 15:18:29 This is  hot stuff, reporting on behalf of  BBC with your local business news. The Neutrals are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  F stocks. Thank you for tuning into  BBC.
1905 2018-07-28 15:17:41 When only the rich get richer revolution becomes inevitable. Prosperity fall all is the only solution. So what if stocks are up, if wages don't increase it's for naught. High employment in low wage jobs won't cut it. Collective bargaining and political activism is vital.
1906 2018-07-28 15:17:31 It means that the Republican CEOs have decided to buy back stocks and more equipment for businesses to make Trump look better. The next quarter may be as good on paper, but will working class see the difference? We'll have to wait and see.
1907 2018-07-28 15:17:18 Isn't it preferable know a business' prejudices and then have the freedom to refuse to patronize them than to have a bigot's spit in one's meal?
1908 2018-07-28 15:16:18 yep...it would be a mistake then...
1909 2018-07-28 15:16:08 I just realized i got the last two stocks of the Stony charms. HA.
1910 2018-07-28 15:16:00 Agreed. Goid for corporations and shareholders. Never trickles down. And just over 50% of Americans own stocks so...good for corporations, dividends and buyback whereas the tax they would pay benefit society as a whole.

1912 2018-07-28 15:15:44 Someone must make something trend for stocks isn't it?
1913 2018-07-28 15:15:08 As you make such negative assumptions about me based on no facts, seems like that leaves only bigotry, doesn't it? As to work places, I believe all businesses should have the right to refuse to service to anyone, and be able to fire anyone for any reason or no reason at all.
1914 2018-07-28 15:14:38 Trend following, momentum.....over the long term losing stocks get dropped off and stocks that have gone up a lot get added to it. That's the core of what these indexes do and why they have kept going up over time.
1915 2018-07-28 15:14:12 No, @ukarlewitz was on recently and he is bullish US stocks.
1916 2018-07-28 15:13:58 Is she bullish on the FANG stocks?
1917 2018-07-28 15:13:40 Currently not accepting orders for now.  I will announce again when there's new stocks. Thank you.
1918 2018-07-28 15:13:34 Wait, it's 300K..not 3K. More stocks that high?
1919 2018-07-28 15:13:09 We have a supplier in KR who have secured and will secure the stocks. We did not directly purchase from Bighit shop since we can't access their website due to traffic. Hence, the higher markup price from the supplier since it was hard to secure stocks ~

1921 2018-07-28 15:10:33 Yes. They only have limited stocks. When I did that, there are only 10 items each shirt size.

1923 2018-07-28 15:07:27 If Twitter doesn't get its act together...stocks will continue tanking.
1924 2018-07-28 15:07:14 Stocks fell... sorry voice communication crazy.
1925 2018-07-28 15:07:08 Stocks are plummeting!
1926 2018-07-28 15:05:53 Over half his customers and wonders why stocks are dropping. Smh People are tired of it. Why fill his pockets? Free speech is being taken away.
1927 2018-07-28 15:05:51 Qanon had a message about this. Zuckerberg is going to be replaced, as is Jack, because both stocks are tanking. Wall Street is pushing them out, want to stop the banning of conservative postings on FB & Twitter.
1928 2018-07-28 15:05:22 That is exactly right.  But even if average people wanted to, they can’t in the US unless they are wealthy.  In other countries (UK, Australia) fractional ownership is more common.  REITs provide exposure but are stocks, not actual real estate.

1930 2018-07-28 15:03:12 The stock market sent a message loud and clear to those holding social media stocks...get out now. Expect Facebook to be hit with lawsuits from all directions...investors don't like to be ripped off.
1931 2018-07-28 15:02:53 What are your thoughts with the other 80% of your account?
I’ve tried searching through your old tweets but couldn’t find any relating to what stocks you feel comfortable with holding shares.
1932 2018-07-28 15:02:30 And why should these two go there and getting themselves laughing stocks?
1933 2018-07-28 15:02:29 Labor data has been rolling over for 6mo before stocks peaked in 2007.. and the curve has been hovering around 0 for 19 months
1934 2018-07-28 15:01:48 Just doing some trade recaps from the week - $RETA 35 pts, $AMZN over 150 pts, $GOOGL over 60 pts, $TORC 10 pts, $NVRO over 20 pts. Why try to trade $AWX for .30 or .50 cents? You don't have to trade cheap stocks to grow your account. Less risk in higher priced imo.
1935 2018-07-28 15:01:43 All tech stocks -20% ... but "cryptos are too volatile" 
1936 2018-07-28 15:01:15 Thanks For Suggestion
1937 2018-07-28 15:01:05 There are characteristics that have been proven over long periods to be associated with above-average rates of return: low P/Es, discounts to book value, low debt/equity ratios, stocks with recent significant price declines, companies with [insider buying] -- Will Browne

1939 2018-07-28 15:00:02 Half do. It would put knife into hearts of millions of honest hard working folks who’ve saved for years socking money into stocks based on advice of brokers who’ve been indoctrinated to think and espouse that stocks safe over long haul.
1940 2018-07-28 14:59:33 Took him to the Metals Investor Forum last May, he may come to PDAC with me next year, maybe the Sprott Symposium next July? I don’t think he’ll be surprised because I explain to him what’s going on with our stocks frequently. He knows the uranium story!

1942 2018-07-28 14:57:37 You do realize that if someone wants to kill they can make their own illegal stocks and also buy them off the streets from criminals. That is the only fact that is relevant here. If people want to kill they will find a way.
1943 2018-07-28 14:56:54 We are here only because of HRITIK Stocks...What if , they start to go down ? All these stocks are extremely over performed against Index ...moreover , out of FAANG, F and N are gone #Facebook#Netlfix
1944 2018-07-28 14:56:31 Markets spook over profit warnings or failed tests, this is about effective espionage by proxy and markets do try to steer clear of stocks so readily influenced by politics.
1945 2018-07-28 14:56:18 To be clear Trump's no strings attached tax "cuts" to corporations w/ pre-existing condition of record profits who used $ to buy back stocks no help to 1/2 country w/ no investments VERY BAD REASON FOR DEBT. 

Helping people w/ pre-existing health conditions GOOD REASON FOR DEBT.
1946 2018-07-28 14:53:29 Like modi is doing?
1947 2018-07-28 14:52:39 Yes , I agree , it should come down a bit , but it will not be a drastic fall unless something destructive comes into picture , 
Time to cautious agree , but yet more than 50% of #nifty stocks are far away from their highs , lot of potential left.
1948 2018-07-28 14:52:36 Your stocks are going to keep dropping as long as you keep silencing political opinions you don't agree with.
1949 2018-07-28 14:51:46 & if it's management wants to become sensorious dictators of what is acceptable opinion, that private company can watch as it's userbase & stocks reach freefall.
1950 2018-07-28 14:50:57 You should wave off his fee,

1965 2018-07-28 14:41:49 Look another person that gets his economic advise from MSNBC! You realize that the economy is largely based on confidence and stocks are typically looking six months in advance! The tax hikes are playing a HUGE role in the economy as well as finally having a pro business @POTUS

1970 2018-07-28 14:39:14 Hey Twitter- heard your stocks fell some 20%. You say it's because of less monthly users.
Here's a clue. They didn't just leave.
YOU CHASED THEM AWAY WITH YOUR UNFAIR PRACTICES!!
1971 2018-07-28 14:39:00 If you want to buy $100,000 in stocks you need $100,000 and if you want to buy $100,000 in #realestate you only need $20,000 (20% down). #CRE #investing

1976 2018-07-28 14:37:36 Dear @Twitter stockholders,

Look what happened to @facebook 

Do you really want to lose that kind of dough?

Stocks are down 20% 

@jack is playing #TwatterGames with conservative accounts.

Rise up & demand that @jack steps down as CEO.

1978 2018-07-28 14:36:08 I want to learn how to invest in stocks 
1979 2018-07-28 14:36:05 Agree! Same reward, but risk is lower. folks still trade penny stocks like $hmny $dry...they are pros I guesss
1980 2018-07-28 14:36:00 This is just a terrible lie, it really is. BTW, have you seen your stocks tanking? It's obvious people have lost faith in Twitter. You brought this on yourself. Bad business practices.
1981 2018-07-28 14:35:52 Incoming stocks ini.. belum ada yang gum sole sih.
Kemarin ada Old Skool DX 41 tapi udah laku.

Tar kalo ada lagi yak.
1982 2018-07-28 14:35:42 When we read "...stock dropped 19 percent, costing shareholders $120 billion..."

Is that honest?

Value of a stock is an illusion based on what thousands of people think the stock is worth.

The #GOPTaxScam has inflated the value of many stocks.

Are we waiting for more shocks?
1983 2018-07-28 14:35:14 @jimcramer , I’m guilty! Use to look for quick buck stocks not best of breed, talking myself into the “big score”. Lost $$$. You have helped me become much more disciplined. My gains have never been so good! BTW, retired at 49!

And so on!
1986 2018-07-28 14:34:31 True. I don’t think I’d ever stop completely, probably move to a more passive/income portfolio rather than nano cap growth stocks.
1987 2018-07-28 14:34:12 Peter Morici, economist & Professor U of Maryland, “led by @paulkrugman at the @newyorktimes110, “Donald Trump was supposed to be a flop! Well, now he’s a SUCCESS!” Will we see other qtrs like this? “I think this president can sustain 3% growth. Wages, Stocks, IRAs will improve!”
1988 2018-07-28 14:33:57 Not at all shocked. Some serious damage to local Peroni stocks by this guy today
1989 2018-07-28 14:33:29 Sorry should have clarified that I meant the corporate tax cuts in which many corporations are buying back their stocks. But point still stands, corporations have the ability to defend against these tariffs because they have the money to move stuff around as opposed to farmers.

1993 2018-07-28 14:31:37 I am learning, through pain and suffering to avoid making or positioning for the big call. This is about my 10th year trading US stocks after leaving index products. I find focusing on rotation and individual situations  is more boring but more lucrative.

1998 2018-07-28 14:30:00 89 percent of global fish stocks are fished at unsustainable levels or at capacity, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization. If you’re a fan of #sharkweek you should also support sustainable seafood practices.

2006 2018-07-28 14:27:09 Of course the state sponsored media is going to back your BS.

2008 2018-07-28 14:26:07 I am very confident:

1. Stocks, bonds, etc should be fully digital.
2. Bitcoin is the only digital ledger that is very trustworthy.

Maybe eventually all virtual assets will be tokens on bitcoin. But they depend on government enforcement. still too early.
2009 2018-07-28 14:24:35 3. We could agree to waive checks to get stocks through. But EU won’t so trade a bit one-sided
2010 2018-07-28 14:24:05 If I recall, you maintained only 3 stocks (in my pms) for quite long time and it is not more than 4 in rest of time. My pf also close to double in 3 years . Thanks to Basantji.
2011 2018-07-28 14:23:57 It's intel for countries to study or ways hacked accounts can spread misinformation.

To me it's a national security issue & security fraud.

#WallStreet and his followers use accounts to monitor stocks & when to invest.
They make announcements b4 fixing prices.
2012 2018-07-28 14:23:22 Very true. 
#Nifty rally from 9000 to 11260, especially post 10,000, has been only in few selective stocks.

For remaining 800 pts also, don't think it's gonna change..

#Investors should be attentive in Next few months for exiting / profit booking in long term holdings.
2013 2018-07-28 14:23:06 What most people don’t understand is the rich very rarely make a huge salary. They get paid a very minimum salary and instead get stocks and interest in the company they work for. Their taxes are based on capital gains which is much lower than regular taxes.

2028 2018-07-28 14:14:25 #Stocks,#Indexes NDX signal looks more serious, exhibiting one key feature of significant top signals, making that long questionable and likely to be exited at opportunity. SPX top signal must be discounted; all characteristics are low grade.

2041 2018-07-28 14:07:29 Do you read his posts before commenting? He says he will continue to provide his thoughts on base metals. He's said lots on #uranium already. If you're still buying those other trashy stocks, he can't help you.

2046 2018-07-28 14:02:24 I agree with them. The behavior of the individual stocks I am focused on is my single biggest tell of overall conditions. But I also believe there is a time to engage and a time to wait.  The indexes tend to be a lagging indicator of environment in my experience.
2047 2018-07-28 14:02:18 Tune in to today's hearing on bump stocks.
2048 2018-07-28 14:01:56 I swear all you need to pick up chicks is a suit and a mediocre bar where chicks dress a bit higher than usual and guys look like peasants. What is yall doing youre giving pussy away way to easily. Youre flooding the market. Pussy stocks are lower than ever
2049 2018-07-28 14:01:38 I hope their stocks plummet even more
2050 2018-07-28 14:01:31 Yes, and watch Twitter stocks take a much bigger nosedive. @realDonaldTrump is the best thing that has ever happened to Twitter.
2051 2018-07-28 14:00:36 my CURRENT plan is to sell half and keep half - i've already made huge gains from both stocks since my averages were so low
2052 2018-07-28 13:59:49 People who have been able to afford buying stocks are doing okay, at least until the next stock bubble manipulation event occurs.
2053 2018-07-28 13:59:11 They won’t have much budget left for silly ads after breaking the record for biggest single loss ever in stocks history...
2054 2018-07-28 13:58:55 @realDonaldTrump TOTAL DISGRACE IS WATCHING PEOPLE RIG STOCKS, PAY OFF CLINTONS AND SERIAL KILL PATIENTS IN BIOTECH TRIALS TO MAKE FAKE NEWS.  THAT IS A TOTAL DISGRACE, AND THE PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE THEM IMMUNITY.  1:02 cv 01242 GBL ED VA and all before the eyes of the world.  SICK

2060 2018-07-28 13:56:23 is it weird I get this sinister joy out of hearing Facebook and Twitter stocks drop?
2061 2018-07-28 13:54:52 Trickle-down economics doesn't work. Its been proven time and time again. Most recent example, the tax cuts just given to corporations this year. Surprise, surprise they didn't use it for R&D or adequate wages for their employees. Nope, they used it to buy-back stocks.
2062 2018-07-28 13:54:21 You simply do not get it, do you? So they’ll just waive customs/borders for insulin stocks? Anything else like radioactive isotopes for hospitals? And why just UK? Why not open up for Russia and Turkey at the same time to increase sales for pharmaceutical sector? 
2063 2018-07-28 13:54:15 @facebook stocks fell down 20%. 
@AMD stocks rose up, doubled the price.
2064 2018-07-28 13:53:43 The #LeftoBot censorship lunacy spreads right across Social Media. And correcting it by legally challenging it will cause investor diaspora across Social Media stocks. Because, it turns out, if all you have is a cosine-distance hammer, everything looks like a word-vector nail.
2065 2018-07-28 13:53:27 What is your opinion on Jesse Stine and Mark Minervini’s assertions that it is better not to watch the indexes and to just focus on individual stocks?
2066 2018-07-28 13:52:35 Omg hahaha! Will try to secure stocks~ 
2067 2018-07-28 13:52:16 @dccc MSNBC-Last Word-7/27: Time for the Trump Conspiracy Crime Family {"Alleged"} to be placed in Stocks & Pillories in Lafayette Park and face Prolonged Public Inquisitions!!!

2068 2018-07-28 13:51:30 his worth was based on how much stock he owns?  then he should of sold them while high.  

little do people know that the stock market is a gov protected ponzi scheme. if all stock holders traded all their stocks for cash, they would only be worth a pile of paper sheets
2069 2018-07-28 13:49:05 Everything is going well but why the stocks of Bullets wireless are not sufficient because at recent 2 sales at #Amazon and OnePlus online store I couldn't able to buy these earphones so I am very disappointed about this and want reply from @OnePlus_IN with reference.
2070 2018-07-28 13:47:05 I think dumb.  I don''t hold stocks overnight, just day trade them all day.  That said, I still wouldn't hold FB long term.  Too easily for it to be blown away overnight to me still.  It sure seems to be losing interest with anyone I talk to.
2071 2018-07-28 13:46:44 Yeah, thats my thought. Im turning negative on stocks and have a short position for the first time in years.
2072 2018-07-28 13:46:17 Very difficult to predict whats happening in markets. In broader way it's quite clear that only some handful stocks are moving and taking markets up..sebi's additional measures is keeping speculators out from mid caps and small caps#Its time to be having cautious approach#
2073 2018-07-28 13:45:40 WHERE ARE STOCKS GOING? WHO WON THE SPORTS? CRIME HAPPENED MAYBE? WHO CARES!
2074 2018-07-28 13:44:35 I have no opinion. I’ll let the action of the market and the action of my core watchlist of stocks determine what is next. Right now, both suggest caution in my eyes.
2075 2018-07-28 13:43:56 dont you have twitter stocks anymore?
2076 2018-07-28 13:43:42 Oliver the problem is storage.

It is not UK manufactured

The UK relies on regular importation, because it does not hold large stocks of insulin because it needs to be stored.

2078 2018-07-28 13:39:23 Mon-Fri i make good money on actual stocks whilst also watching money tied up in crypto currency do either nothing, very little or just go deeper red.

Why did i give crypto currency a go again? 
2079 2018-07-28 13:39:05 People hated AMZN and GOOGL in early 2015, hated banks in early 2016, hated stocks after Trump won, hated retailers mid-2017...
2080 2018-07-28 13:38:50 I would like to know how investing in Stocks will bar you from entering the USA. how in the world is that a sane thing to do. like how will a boarder narc know that I sell stocks without asking. thats a little over the line to stop folks from entering.
2081 2018-07-28 13:38:43 Pitt, you need to do better in ur selection on ur 401k stocks. I remove any non-performing stocks. I give it the Trump treatment. You fail to perform, ur fired!
2082 2018-07-28 13:38:16 Only for index stocks ...five scrips are not complete reflection of all...mid and small caps already corrected heavily ..
2083 2018-07-28 13:38:02 Okay, that shall suffice for now. Coming up later.... energy stocks. You're welcome to submit your requests.

2092 2018-07-28 13:27:45 He sold everything when @realDonaldTrump was elected, then invested heavily into BitCoin and then dipped back into stocks with a massive Facebook purchase. Paul currently washes windshields at the stoplight by Trump Tower. Still @NYT financial expert though.
2093 2018-07-28 13:27:24 @smerconish If wages don't increase, a strong economy won't help most Americans. Strong corporate profits help the wealthy not middle incomers who don't own stocks. Real wages decreased over the last year for non-supervisory workers. Tax cut is not delivering for most Americans.
2094 2018-07-28 13:27:01 Worse than ever, but fear not, friends, our President is on it. In the interim, Twitter, along with their side-kick FB, are feeling the pain, both stocks are tanking! Karma 
2095 2018-07-28 13:26:04 Not caffeine but soda-need my morning boost of java
2096 2018-07-28 13:25:27 Problem is the punishment does not fit the crime. Bring back the stocks and put them in the stocks for a couple of days. release them to go for a no 2. Let them piss them themselves and eat whatever is thrown at them. They wont do it again
2097 2018-07-28 13:24:08 Are you having a laugh?

The US has huge stocks of insulin and the aircraft flying from America to Britain don't pass over Europe...

And if the eu is such a caring partner as it proclaims, would they refuse supplies? Then that shows you what sort of people you are dealing with
2098 2018-07-28 13:23:45 Corporations spent roughly 6% on bonuses.  Wages are down.  What they did with their tax windfall is buy their stocks back to inflate their worth to inflate CEO compensation.  New CBO report says this tax cut will add $100 billion to deficit a year.
2099 2018-07-28 13:23:15 #Facebook and #Twitter ban conservative users they can't afford to lose,  and their respective stocks drop like rocks. One hell of a business  model. #WalkAway
2100 2018-07-28 13:23:01 The reinvestment is the company’s doing the buy back of stocks to retain value. Plus it gives the shareholders the $, not the employees. Only .025% went to employee bonuses or wages.

There is only 1 motivation to bash stocks...attempt to scare others into selling the stock so the basher can buy in at a cheap rate.  So ignore the hate.

2120 2018-07-28 13:03:35 Well, it is that time of the life to begin significant "giving back".  I have been blessed and I want to share.  Anyone have experience with "donor advised funds" with vanguard or other places?  Should I deposit stocks w/ significant cap gains or cash?  #donoradvisedfunds
2121 2018-07-28 13:03:17 Then your husband works for a good company and probably would have done those things anyway but many companies and corporations are just using this tax break to buy back their own stocks. The damage being done to our country is about more than money.
2122 2018-07-28 13:03:09 should we be unloading our stocks? Will going back to gold standard hurt the evaluation?

2133 2018-07-28 12:56:25 I just finished discussing my most basic theories about religion and the scales of justice based on 12 person juries agreeing on a verdict, say length of time in the stocks, with a Thai Buddhist.
2134 2018-07-28 12:55:44 Law banning bump stocks wouldn’t  have allowed him fire as many rounds/bullets into crowd. Less bullets=less deaths/injured.
Background checks at gun shows could’ve flagged something in his history. Banning assault weapons for civilians, their sole purpose of creation is for war.
2135 2018-07-28 12:54:41 what is average ROCE of these stocks
2136 2018-07-28 12:54:11 Guess that explains their stocks free fall
2137 2018-07-28 12:53:45 With many new IPOs and offerings, global cash flows into #biotech are definately positive YTD, imho. Quite a few ETFs and global funds have replaced specialized biotech funds in some stocks. Next week's data will be interesting after Friday's sell off $XBI $IBB $SPY $SPX $QQQ
2138 2018-07-28 12:53:00 Inside trading? Why wouldn't anyone sell their Stocks after the CEO is selling a lot of his? He knows more than anyone what's going on inside the sinking ship!
2139 2018-07-28 12:52:58 do you know any good graphic packs that have some unique effects, stocks, etc. or link me the ones that you think are very good 
2140 2018-07-28 12:52:43 Um, I'm finishing up my best short film project ever, my comedy is taking off, I'm teaching poetry, my stocks pay 20%/yr, I'm up like 1,000 pips in forex ytd, I just joined a multi-million dollar business equity firm with my own territory, & I'm sober... WTF is going on...
2141 2018-07-28 12:52:40 I deleted over 9 years of past tweets yesterday and Twitter stocks plunge 20%. Coincidence? 

2142 2018-07-28 12:52:28 It was thriving because it was hoovering up whatever was left alive in our waters. Quotas are the need to protect stocks 
Much of our UK quotas have been sold abroad instead of used here. That's not the EUs fault, its UK govt/owners fault.
Also UK begged to join EU. No conning.
2143 2018-07-28 12:51:56 ROXY UNNIE NOTICE: I decided NOT to take order for army bomb ver 3 FOR NOW. I am planning to buy them during the concert so i still need to check if there will be enough stocks during the con and if they will limit the purchase.
2144 2018-07-28 12:51:00 I would like to help but I don't own any stocks. Sold all when I retired
2145 2018-07-28 12:49:56 my dad cleared the mess I made again I ordered the wrong stocks for him & it got me into a 6.5k debt  (I only fork out 1k for the down payment & he cleared the remaining 5.5k for me omg)
2146 2018-07-28 12:47:29 Cement stocks might take a hit.
2147 2018-07-28 12:47:19  I guess you don’t understand Mr. Fitton they we’re just trying to make sure we all share a nice friendly conversation . I hope Their stocks goes down another billion or two
2148 2018-07-28 12:44:37 Not really. Investment doesn’t mean jobs. It means returns for the guys buying back their stocks.
2149 2018-07-28 12:43:44 Yeah. We're headed for a slump. Don't buy any property or stocks in the next 8 quarters
2150 2018-07-28 12:43:43 Critical thinking is my favorite. Let’s review the facts. 58 ppl DEAD & 851 ppl INJURED. Shooter used bump stocks which helped his semi automatic fire as an automatic. He fired more than 1,100 rifle rounds approximately 490 yards into the crowd. Time of shooting was 10:05-10:15pm
2151 2018-07-28 12:42:32 The final qualification is “SILENCE”. Keep your own silent counsel. Keep victories and failures to yourself. Learn from them both. Poise, Patience, and Silence are attributes that must be cultivated.

2152 2018-07-28 12:42:17 No I kept my initial purchase from last year, it's just that I didn't have my whole net worth on it. If the farce goes too far I'll have to consider being 100% invested in antibiotics stocks as there's no real alternative to fight bacterial infections and R&D in the space is mute

2156 2018-07-28 12:38:43 Maybe when Twitter stocks drop another 20-30% they'll reconsider their tactics.
2157 2018-07-28 12:37:00 So we went to kids store to buy my daughters clothes for Autumn but the stocks not yet arrive so we ended up buying her underwear
2158 2018-07-28 12:35:56 Unfortunately the majority of Americans can’t afford a $400.00 meltdown let alone to buy stocks.
2159 2018-07-28 12:33:30 I wonder how many insiders were dumping their Twitter stocks yesterday? We can only hope the SEC is starting up an investigation like it was reported the day before with Facebook when insiders were dumping 4.1B a couple of weeks before Thursday's slide.
2160 2018-07-28 12:33:20 Facebook and Bank of America stocks dropped like crazy .... now is the time to come in for the kill if y’all haven’t already
2161 2018-07-28 12:32:51 Tech stocks plummeting, and analysts reading into it due to “undelrying issues” is hilarious. It’s due to the end of QE people. Those issues were there before.
2162 2018-07-28 12:32:37 I hope your stocks drop another 20%.

2170 2018-07-28 12:18:25 Headline: Twitter and Facebook shares drop 20%; billions in wealth wiped out

Reality: Twitter and Facebook were overvalued and reset to where they were at the beginning of the year before their stocks soared for no reason based on the real world

2178 2018-07-28 12:14:14 Sounds cynical and ive hedged with a passive portfolio along with the active in case. but the passive ‘make money while golfing’ ETF fad doesnt make sense except if its recession hedged. majority of etfs are rebranded FANG stocks gone parabolic not my cup of tea

2188 2018-07-28 12:00:04 Hi again. I like your apps and am a paying member. How do I learn more about strategy. Picking stocks is fine but not sure when to exit, when to wait, is profit realization good/bad, so many questions.

2196 2018-07-28 11:51:42 I do very well with trading stocks, BUT when I get ahead I need to stop placing big options bets, kills my bottom line every time but I kinda like the gamble.
2197 2018-07-28 11:51:04 I cannot believe there wasn’t another joint of beef in store available if there wasn’t that means there not stocking properly so people who get early delivery’s loose put if there not getting early morning stocks in ready for early deliverys
2198 2018-07-28 11:50:02 Really why aren’t you threatening new taxes on the Corporations that took their cuts to buy back stocks instead of of raising wages. Like you said would happen. Typical B.S. politician.
2199 2018-07-28 11:49:46 On aime trop pleurer dans ce pays.

Pourtant sont à majorité issus de ce système pourri. Pourquoi pleurer ?
2200 2018-07-28 11:49:23 The more I read and study about investing from legendary investors the more I stay away from trading.

It's already difficult to buy great stocks, let alone predicting what it would do in the next 10 minutes, days or weeks!

2204 2018-07-28 11:46:26 I wonder if PE has any significance left now. Market has been recently going up on the back of stocks that looked already stretched on their valuations. This market seems to be chasing predictable growth. At any cost !!!

2213 2018-07-28 11:33:09 No, but rising inflation, stocks that are overvalued based on price-earnings ratios and a collapsing housing market are pretty reliable indicators.  Good luck!
2214 2018-07-28 11:31:50 Rockets were used by Marathas in battle of Panipat, but stocks got exhausted by 2PM. Rockets were also  standard weaponry adjunct to artillery of Moghul army. Aurangzeb used them against Shivaji's forts.

2217 2018-07-28 11:30:52 Stocks selling always comes when USD starts to rise. Its normal.
2218 2018-07-28 11:27:54 I still see it as a win. We will hopefully see some improvements in shipping in the future if Amazon Australia stocks it locally.
2219 2018-07-28 11:27:39 We were late cycle. Tax cuts / less regulation will extend it though just as QEs did. Those who complained about QE missed the stock rally. So long as corporate #earnings expectations can improve & growth remains above trend, stocks can justifiably go higher.
2220 2018-07-28 11:26:06 Thanks Stephen. I did use them back in the day...what's the availability for stocks to short?
2221 2018-07-28 11:23:07 Or the EO from Dec 21st regarding human trafficking just sucked away 20% of the stocks of each company.

Enjoy the show 
2222 2018-07-28 11:22:24 I noticed that when I've stopped fucking with people, their stocks and popularity dropped. They went from having Blac Chyna popularity when she was with Rob Kardashian to her popularity now where she can barely scrape by making 2K for appearances.
2223 2018-07-28 11:21:19 Right after their stocks drop by 20%. Coincidence or conspiracy?

2236 2018-07-28 11:01:39 All infra funds are down big way... Markets behaving as if we are in a recession. Buying stocks at 75 PE & 7 times PB & ignoring everything else...
2237 2018-07-28 11:01:22 It's good to see  politicians coming out and reporting being shadowbanned.  It's ridiculous, and it's taking away our freedom of speech. Facebook just took a nose dive in their stocks, so I would hope Twitter is paying attention.
2238 2018-07-28 11:01:01 You can divide crowd into 4 category.

I. Collect cash Dollar, Rupees, Pounds etc.
II.  Buy Houses, Farm Lands, Golds and more.

IV. Always Invest in Startup with Long Term Vision over 10yrs.

2252 2018-07-28 10:43:31 Actually their stocks plummeted due to the fact that they're not growing as fast as before anymore (who should even join at this point is a mystery, but that's economics for you). The scandals surely didn't help and this feels like some sort of karma, so yay anyway lol

2257 2018-07-28 10:38:31 Obama s GDP growth averaged a paltry 1.48 % over 8 yrs ( 32 Q) , very poor. Trump's GDP is on an upward trend . The US economy is booming : employment, stocks , GDP, consumer sentiment. It's ridiculous to argue otherwise.
2258 2018-07-28 10:36:42 You're the one fearmongering with your claim that parts of the govt can hold back stocks in supply chains they have very little control over.

The issue is with JIT supply chains & the lack of planning for new customs procedures.

Talking about that isn't fearmongering

2268 2018-07-28 10:21:07 Lots to learn from this week's trading. Been great!  Seeing Facebook and Twitter gap down like that after earnings was very intriguing.  Social Media stocks, technically great, aren't always the best fundamentally, so I doubt I'll hold them through earnings in the future. $SPX

2278 2018-07-28 10:06:41 Getting stocks on a blockchain in a way that regulators won't get mad is no small feat. It's expensive and inefiicient. If the premise is that someone wants to start an exchange to allow trading securities with BTC, it's easier for them to do that on the traditional system.
2279 2018-07-28 10:02:43 Wouldn't the most popular strategy by definition be to bandwagon rising stocks? Or am I arguing semantics here.
2280 2018-07-28 10:02:34 Ur point is understandable but in real life people that are ultra rich just don't have millions sitting in a bank; they're invested in other companies, stocks, future projects, etc. So giving away without control can domino into bankruptcy
2281 2018-07-28 10:00:56 Pls Ref chapter #19 from 'Beating the Street' by Peter Lynch' where he suggests to buy stocks of MF companies instead of individual MF products from those companies...hope this is clear.
2282 2018-07-28 09:59:07 It's a tax free savings account. Either normal savings, or using stocks/shares. Largely irrelevant to most in the UK since interest rates plummeted and our tax free allowance on interest increased to £1k though.

2291 2018-07-28 09:41:52 @BruniCharting is it a coincidence that Indian IT firms recently made ATHs at the same time as US IT companies? Or is there a correlation?  Ergo =>Impending downtick in Indian IT stocks?
2292 2018-07-28 09:41:43 How are elements of the govt going to hold back stocks exactly? You know that most insulin products are purchased by private pharmacies from private suppliers and multi-national manufacturers.
2293 2018-07-28 09:40:03 Will get worse under Republicans. They’ll take us backwards w/ priorities of Corp profits, stocks, the rich get richer & have hc while the rest get sick & go broke. It’s The Have & The Have Nots Society under Trump & Trump Republicans.
2294 2018-07-28 09:39:59 India stocks hit record highs as experts consider their 'safe haven' potential. Believe that and I have a bridge to sell you. A long one!

2297 2018-07-28 09:38:15 The S&P 500 was positive through the first half of 2018 purely because of the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google).

Likewise our Indian markets are hitting all time high because of Hrithik(HDFC twins,RIL,Infy,TCS,HUL,Indusind,Kotak)

2300 2018-07-28 09:33:03 Dude it's really good but the hype matters in stock market and business. When nawaz shareef was elected as a pm the situation was pretty much the same. As the stocks started doing great. Hype is what matters in stock market! But well, IA Dollar will devalue in coming months.

2305 2018-07-28 09:25:11 I guess Twitter thinks they can meddle in our countries elections, just like Facebook. Sounds like it's time for their stocks to drop. Sell all your Twitter stock!!

2318 2018-07-28 09:11:40 They aren't, it's a #NatFact wet dream, the opposite is actually verifiably true. Oil returns are estimated at £900m next year, renewables don't power Scotland let alone anywhere else and fish stocks?...ppffffff. EU aren't flexible....in anything, their way or no way.
2319 2018-07-28 09:10:26 I guess if the fee was quite low some people might  pay, personally l wouldn’t unless it was a lot more informative, plus l was a bit disappointed after Vlad stocks video’s stopped after such a short amount of time.

2321 2018-07-28 09:07:53 Agree nice company but maybe on the current valuation they needed a continuation of the "exciting" newsflow to maintain the price. I have looked for a while now but trying to keep my folio beelow 25 stocks means I miss a few.

2332 2018-07-28 08:51:35 What planet do you live on? When people are investing in stocks our country has money to build and grow. By the way, a huge amount of working men and women have 401k’s. Which are primarily stocks.

2340 2018-07-28 08:43:31 stock markets are rigged in the most honest and exclusive way at the highest and most decentralized possible level primarily by unlimited supply of money resulting in potentially unlimited supply of selected stocks with the incidental deliberate insider information.
2341 2018-07-28 08:43:30 Even if UK could 'own' all N Sea fish there would still need to be quotas. They protect stocks from overfishing.

2342 2018-07-28 08:43:16 I don’t think its just about the knowledge of their abuses. We’ve (public) has known for a while. So why NOW? And why BOTH companies same week?

2364 2018-07-28 08:19:28 Buying these kind of stocks near the peak of this cycle is like jumping in a fire 
2365 2018-07-28 08:16:32 Not if you read between the lines. They can sugar-coat it all they want but it still won't change the fact most of the S&P500 took a tumble. If e/thing is ok and companies are reporting higher than expected earnings then it's mystery why their stocks don't reflect that 'reality'

2369 2018-07-28 08:12:54 Not if they're stocks keep dropping, they're in it to make money. Just depends how many billions of dollars they think they need.
2370 2018-07-28 08:12:16 These stocks grew 100 percent in less than a year.
2371 2018-07-28 08:06:00 so w $LIFE or other stocks the shareholders are  locked for the longer haul. w it in a way luckily is under cash so at least can bounce up to it. there are stocks that are above cash .. few times over and can further drop.. so in comparison its better w it.
2372 2018-07-28 08:05:56 Quarterly results at Exxon & Chevron fall short.  Exxon had rise in net income to $4bn, output declining 7%.  Chevron more than doubled net income to $3.4bn but below predictions.  #ExxonMobil #chevron #sp500 #StocksToWatch #stocks #trading #investing #WallStreet #cboe #options
2373 2018-07-28 08:05:02 So some of your stocks fell 70% :)
2374 2018-07-28 08:04:43 look there is lots of manipulation in biotech esp now when the $XBI cant break resistance. lots of stocks dropped but I believe they where accumulated . $LIFE presented a  phase1 thing.. its early .  no need for it to go up for nothing before insiders can add options etc.
2375 2018-07-28 08:04:04 The only way to secure one is buy ordering now while stocks last. Once they’re gone, they’re gone. Only 1000 produced.

2392 2018-07-28 07:37:55 The most popular strategy amongst new investors is to try to catch these "falling knives". It's easy to get blinded by the potential profit and forget that stocks usually drop for a good reason.

2394 2018-07-28 07:36:19 as much as we all want to see Facebook stocks plunges or twitter, remember, who and how much they  have earned and are enjoying their profits! stay vigilant! it doesn't mean it is for the people. Everything goes into their pockets !

Unless and until the buying in top 20 stocks comes down, index doesn’t look like in a correction mode. Que? is whether 11k will come first or 11.5 k will come first.

2401 2018-07-28 07:25:10 Sir dow, nifty etc are not individual stocks, but are collection of good company stocks, which keep on changing from time to time,
So one can't compair nifty return with stocks as many of good company stocks are down when dow, nifty are life time high, like sbi, tataI motors etc
2402 2018-07-28 07:24:50 Yeah, but before they leave, we should put them in the stocks for a while and let them understand exactly what ordinary folk think about their treasonous behaviour. Wouldn't that be just wonderful.
2403 2018-07-28 07:24:24 Many brokers allow this facility... Like ICICI direct.. there must be many more also... I never did myself.. bcz India has a vast variety of stocks.. so don't need US for now

2414 2018-07-28 07:15:28 Buffet is well aware of the value of hard money Marius, the guy was alive when pocket change was made of real silver and notes were backed by actual gold in reserve.

2415 2018-07-28 07:13:20 I have the utmost respect for Danny. He built his business from scratch, he has really helped to promote Carp Fishing through his various TV shows.

2416 2018-07-28 07:12:51 I spoke about home improvement cos on @ETNOWlive last month odd. While most stocks are up from there as long as there is opp and good fin control there is lots of room
2417 2018-07-28 07:12:18 Fair, I guess the runs and stocks are somewhat questionable anyway. Those are probably better indicators. Some of the drop I agree with you is destocking, but 600/d pipe from Russia also started in Jan. Also trimmed runs in summer for pollution control

2419 2018-07-28 07:10:04 Investing into stocks, bonds, and stuff in your own account is sort of like multi-tasking. 

If you're good at multi-tasking, you can trade crypto, just keep up with other areas of your life too.

The stock had hit a high of 253.33 (adjusted) in July 2013 and hit a low of 252.50 in March 2018. 

So ITC has not done anything significant in past 5 years.

Let's keep it current though. You're barred from quantum computing for life. Sorry, that's just not capitalism.
2480 2018-07-28 06:08:30 Isn't it wrong for a investor to  dream that 3-4 stocks are going to change the fortune instead of investing regularly in good companies? If finding Great companies are so easy that ppl won't lost  ever
2481 2018-07-28 06:07:04 That's a convenient fiction, but it's delusional; no govt invented laptops/smart phones, or anything resembling the servers/infrastructure that works so well it is nearly invisible.

I'm talking taking something someone else invented, and selling it for the same price or less without paying a dime in R&D.

2494 2018-07-28 05:49:01 The most fulfilling thing about my job is that besides making money hourly, I’ve learned so much about the stocks that I’m investing in and making even more money (well, once I sell them I guess but currently we are moving and shaking )
2495 2018-07-28 05:48:54 Facebook didn't really lose $15 billion in one day. That's just the stock market algorithm prioritizing higher quality stocks.
2496 2018-07-28 05:48:49 Umm, gas prices, groceries, electricity, home building materials, automobiles have gone up a lot in price.  Corporations buying back stocks, wages are flat not even keeping up with inflation which means people were lied to about the great tax break.  I am paying more for goods!!!

2501 2018-07-28 05:46:32 Read the original article. Y'all are the definition of what people call sheep. Dude says he owns guns, all about the 2nd amendment and all he says about the NRA is that the gunshow loophole where people can get bump stocks needs to get changed
2502 2018-07-28 05:44:07 Because this is only a rich man's economic boom. 10% of the population own at least 80% of all stocks, and for most people, wages have been stagnant for years. Real earnings, after inflation, are actually in the red, as the middle class continues to shrink.
2503 2018-07-28 05:43:43 Two things:
1) Facebook stocks took a nose dive recently, which I'd like to buy those stocks when  they're low, so I can sell them when they go up again.

2) I ate a 16 oz sirlion medium steak w/onions & mushrooms today & I'm still hungry. Got to eat late night again.

2511 2018-07-28 05:36:16 Stephen, your setups and strategies work with larger floats and large cap stocks, too. No need to trade the hyped up low floats. There are plenty of other lucrative movers put there daily, which are less crowded with pumpers and criminals.

2543 2018-07-28 05:08:49 there's a reason for this, the biggest cost for most landlords is in nominal terms (the mortgage), if a landlord keeps rents flat all they lose is opportunity cost of not having put that capital in stocks or whatever, they take less rent, they have a money-losing business.

2547 2018-07-28 05:02:22 I tried to detect those stocks that resisted the decline. I reasoned that if they could swim against the stream, they were the ones that would advance most rapidly when the current changed.    - Nicolas

2558 2018-07-28 04:47:16 It was now a question of estimating how sick the stocks were and how long their sickness would last. I reasoned that if a stock has fallen from 100 to 40, it will almost certainly not climb up to the same high again for a long, long time. ,,- Nicolas Darvas

Hi guys, there will only be limited stocks available for this. Estimate price will be Php 2150-Php 2250. Please like this tweet if you're a sure buyer. No exact date for payment yet but it's within August. Form will be up later or tom.
2566 2018-07-28 04:38:12 Thanks Brian. Agree, I saw a few as well. Industrials, financials, & some basic materials/energy stocks held up well.
2567 2018-07-28 04:38:02 You see their stocks? Lol! Lost millions! I say stay off Twitter and FB.
2568 2018-07-28 04:37:43 My only issue w/ @ericchurch is the “rights right and wrongs wrong”. Bro...that’s your OPINION! Do you know how SIMPLE bump stocks are to fabricate even if banned? And how many mass shootings from “gun show” guns. Don’t act holier than thou cause you THINK you’re right.
2569 2018-07-28 04:36:52 Given the current state of affairs, I couldn't be happier that Twitter and Facebook stocks are plummeting. Today's so called news surrounding the @dallascowboys is a perfect example of why its happening. 1/2
2570 2018-07-28 04:36:37 Also. Take NOTE:
Check on your retirement accounts. With certain ones, if your IRA invested in Facebook as part of the stocks you may also be eligible. Call your broker.

2572 2018-07-28 04:34:12 Twitter: we're purging "fake accounts"

2573 2018-07-28 04:33:28 This is one of the most misguided, jealous quotes I've ever read. LOL He gets rid of people and you say he's filling the swamp cause it suits you. Go buy some weed stocks, sit on your ass and think it's you who moves the industry forward. 
2574 2018-07-28 04:33:19 This needs to stop. Equal playing field  for all or they can’t claim to be fair. Stocks down? There’s a reason
2575 2018-07-28 04:31:36 #BCH went from $650 to $800 in the past month, this is A LOT if you compare with stocks. We should be happy instead of complaining of boring of sideways market. Reality is, crazy parabolic bubbles don't last that long & don't happen that often.

2582 2018-07-28 04:17:51 Cyclicals look really attractive at these levels. Many stocks are down 30-50% in the recent correction.

If you are bullish about Indian economy & if you are bullish about Modi you have to bet on cyclicals. I see good returns to be made in cyclical sectors over next 3-4 years.

Estate tax is intended to discourage creation of aristocracy. Donations to charitable causes is consistent with that legitimate objective.

2613 2018-07-28 03:42:47 What isn't true? Pumping stocks happens every single day whether they're compensated or non-compensated is another question. Sometimes companies know, sometimes they "don't." Newsletters, chat rooms, promotional mailers, etc. What's the question?

2624 2018-07-28 03:36:44 I do not buy individual stocks. I just buy the whole market. NASDAQ dragged the U.S. indexes down a lot, as did Twitter today.

2630 2018-07-28 03:30:34 On a normal day even though almost all feel their stocks as real businesses, the moment fear strikes they just want to jump out of the ship. Personally, I just love this misbehaviour of many

2639 2018-07-28 03:22:49 Welp, we didn’t really need the “bad stock day” from Facebook to spill over to our twitter stocks. I mean obviously, being down $8/stock != being down $40/stock with a bigger valuation. But still, now we need you too to use the hell out of this app 
2640 2018-07-28 03:21:55 In the late '70s, I reclaimed my name. If society had still had stocks as punishment, I would have spent a lot of time in them. Some folks were so angry! It was amazing. Names are powerful and important. It is sad to hear that there is still so much disapproval.

2648 2018-07-28 03:15:04 Not true actually. The proposed tax on stock trades, .1 cent per trade, would pay for a hell of a lot of social spending without raising anyone's income taxes. Only people hurt would be a handful of day traders who make money by churning stocks, which has no social benefit.

2676 2018-07-28 02:57:31 Cuzz believe me or not im not ur enemy not only did that help info wars but gave them more fuel for there fire by doing that now they just luanched there app which will pull from here and after there done dumpin facebooks stocks into the ground twitters next and this bias helped
2677 2018-07-28 02:57:31 When you can’t afford to pay your bills or put food on the table or buy the things you need, a GDP % or rising stocks are MEANINGLESS. They only speak to the wealthiest 1% of the country, not even remotely to the rest of us. #msnbc

2679 2018-07-28 02:54:32 If they are really doing this, perhaps their stocks need to take a nose dive like Zuckerberg's did this week.
2680 2018-07-28 02:53:44 Alright, you guys know all the hype about bitcoin but do you know how to get into the stock market? Do want to know more about stocks. Comment below and I'll try my best. Start asking!
2681 2018-07-28 02:53:38 Which is why they carry them in separate shotguns. You will see the less lethal shotguns have brightly colored stocks and forends. No Dept anywhere that I know of, switch between round types in the same shotgun.  But it does take extra time to organize less lethal deployments.
2682 2018-07-28 02:53:00 reasons I'm not a real adult, according to my younger siblings:

- I can't drive
- I haven't bought any stocks
- I haven't invested in Bitcoin
2683 2018-07-28 02:52:21 Corp buying back to push stocks higher or hold prices up from dropping. Classic.
2684 2018-07-28 02:52:09 Amidst Facebook plunge, people are selling their unrelated tech stocks... Lol
2685 2018-07-28 02:50:49 I think this is true for a lot of aspects of comics production. Colors, paper/cover stocks, lettering, storytelling, etc. There’s a lot of stuff today that is much better though, starting with how more, diverse people are making comics. Wish we could have all things.
2686 2018-07-28 02:50:42 Invested in stocks & bonds today . My money gotta make money.
2687 2018-07-28 02:50:29 Shadow banned. .... Time to sell off those twitter stocks.
2688 2018-07-28 02:50:24 We have reached the point in my relationship with the local 7-11 that I am hiding stocks of my favorite snack items behind the weak products so that I can guarantee that they will be there waiting for me
2689 2018-07-28 02:50:17 At the same time @redbullracing should promote James Key to the senior team as technical director, his stocks are very high in the paddock, they better pile his bank account with cash and give him a good position within the organization. #F1 #HungarianGP cc @ToroRosso

2691 2018-07-28 02:46:51 Social media stocks are falling across the board as a result of censoring conservatives! Y'all are getting your "come-uppance" now! They forgot, we're 60,000,000+++ strong!
2692 2018-07-28 02:45:53 Mmm don’t be asking for me later then when I get to choose what you look like
2693 2018-07-28 02:45:49 My two favorite natural gas stocks $PONY and $CR have made some good move this week. But I prefer they can pull back a little bit to cool down the RSI before they can go higher.
2694 2018-07-28 02:43:47 It's bad enough being a liberal with mediocre intellect. Then writing checks they can't cash- Same like they did when they put all their stocks into Hillary. You end up losing. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
2695 2018-07-28 02:43:13 Better job numbers than Obama ever had, better stocks than Obama ever had. And all they can do is HATE. So SAD! #maga #trump

2703 2018-07-28 02:38:22 NOT once did Obozo have a Quarter above 2.3%! He averaged 1.7% over 32 quarters! MOSTLY due by raiding the Treasury and dumping our tax $ into corporate welfare to the tune of $17 trillion! Stocks crashed twice under Obozo. Record crashes!
2704 2018-07-28 02:38:17 Blocked me coz I respond with facts. Even social media has now become पीठ के पीछे seems some paid agenda. According to him we should have crashed coz stocks are “overvalued”. Proven with data we outperformed in the entire fall; nothing to say!
2705 2018-07-28 02:37:51 Don't just watch index & believe your portfolio might do well, in fact lot of portfolios of big funds are bleeding or is flat, even after Indian benchmark indices historical run.

Watch individual stocks & take appropriate churning decisions. 

Take some money off the table.

2712 2018-07-28 02:30:12 Yeah...but its compleate BS, its not read growth. Its all due to companies buying back their own stocks which inflates the price of their stocks n makes it look like the company is growing and making more money....but it's not. Which is why wages have dropped 2% n keeps dropping.
2713 2018-07-28 02:29:38 Talk dirty to me (ya know stocks and bonds, 401k, retirement, etc)
2714 2018-07-28 02:29:27 Fcebook and twitter stocks have been crashing this week - must be Climate Change.
2715 2018-07-28 02:28:53 Ouais ça c’est avec la machine 3D nan? sinon les grandes marques qui font des gros stocks impossible que ce soit comme ça
2716 2018-07-28 02:28:39 Economics 101:
@Twitter , quit #Shadowbanning see stocks rise.
@facebook , quit banning #Conservatives, see stocks rise. How are these 2 huge companies losing $$ in this economy? It’s not that hard to figure out... America is conservative! Proofs in the pudding, y’all ...
2717 2018-07-28 02:28:16 Oh GAWD PLEASE....We had the most unstable roller coaster sluggish economy in history that never got close to 3% GDP! My stocks and 401K are liking this upward steady growth! If you aren't benefiting you are doing something wrong!
2718 2018-07-28 02:27:21 I know there are many jokes to be found here, but the casual acceptance and indeed support for prostitution there is disturbing on so many levels. Plus, Clinton is a pig who should be put in the stocks in the town square where his victims can throw rooting fruit at his head.
2719 2018-07-28 02:27:04 liberal platform stocks will loose 50% of their gains
2720 2018-07-28 02:26:21 The percentage of stocks I take with up air and up smash compared to every other move is absurd
2721 2018-07-28 02:26:05 Been struggling with how to find the stocks and if theres anything else i should find out about the stocks apart from what the company is about, if theres any news to it, any catalysts... Still pretty scared to trade. Doing the risk reward is getting confusing.

2728 2018-07-28 02:22:52 90% of people on Twitter talking #potstocks have zero clue why stocks are doing what they are doing, while anyone could be negative right now & be right with outcome. It’s for all the wrong reasons.
2729 2018-07-28 02:21:50 Why is the shooter never blamed? An NRA member has never committed a mass shooting! They already ruled against bump stocks. If not for the NRA, the left would have us defenseless like the UK!
2730 2018-07-28 02:21:37 2/2  And they aren’t. They are almost ALL using the money to buy back their own stocks or give one time bonuses to long-time employees (20 years or more). Wages are staying flat and jobs aren’t increasing any more than before the tax bill. In fact, they’ve slowed.
2731 2018-07-28 02:21:16 So I actually listened to most of your podcasts for the first time this week. Most of the stocks you discuss were hitting ATHs. Thing that stuck out to me most was the group-think coming from the bulls. The 'not sure why it's going up, but if it goes down I'll get out' mentality.
2732 2018-07-28 02:21:05 Foreign investors are decreasing investments in US stocks as they’re uncertain about the direction of US regulations and trade under the current administration....selling assets here is depressing our stock valuations from their potential.....

2739 2018-07-28 02:19:13 First, I don't believe bump stocks should exist.

Second, it is propaganda. They gave no factual information about the AR-15, outside of the fact that it's used in mass shootings. They actively perpetuate that the AR-15 is the same thing as an M16 and M4.
2740 2018-07-28 02:18:12 me: im not going to join this panick buying for Army bomb! im not going !

2748 2018-07-28 02:13:05 Blind trust that his family members copy the purchases and sales of stocks and investments.  Hardly “blind” in any way, shape or form.
2749 2018-07-28 02:13:00 If the story changes for the worse, I will sell. Obviously if I owned horse and buggy stocks and then the car was invented, I would sell and swap into car stocks. I just don't use stops. I'll sell if I have to but not just because the price dropped.

2763 2018-07-28 02:00:45 Keeps hitting that button! Is that the same button that created low unemployment , high stocks, businesses coming back,  high ratings, consumer confidence, wish we had that button in  Arnold just trying to keep himself relevant before his show flopp’s
2764 2018-07-28 02:00:37 Yeah they used all their tax money to buy back stocks.  4 percent went to workers.  Wages haven't changed.  You don't care about workers.  You care about yourself!
2765 2018-07-28 01:59:05 And the tariffs will make it no better....best stocks to buy now?? Anything telehealth related...what else???
2766 2018-07-28 01:57:38 Tech companies like Twitter, Facebook. Probably Google next that cozied up to the Deep State will pay a big price stocks going to plummet heard from a broker there pulling money out already before the big dive happens
2767 2018-07-28 01:57:25 I think it's an indication that mobrs between stocks in Russell 2000 became very correlated in 2018 with high implied skews. High implied correlation and skews on the index components produce smaller at-the-money volatility on the index #VIX @GunjanJS @VolatilityWiz
2768 2018-07-28 01:57:14 I'm replying to your tweet to express my support. MAGA-Twitter have lost their collective (tiny) mind.

2776 2018-07-28 01:51:05 Our CEO is the richest man in the world and all supervisor pay was cut by 25% in January. All new internal managers make 25% less than before total compensation, including stocks. The only thing that changed when that happened was Bezos got richer.

2782 2018-07-28 01:49:33 Wages have actually decreased 1.7% over the lat 6 months since the tax bill was passed. The tax bill did result in corporations buying back more than $17B in stocks and immense tax cuts for the top 1%. Mid-Americans? You just gave yourself away, there comrade. Take care.
2783 2018-07-28 01:48:59 you are right, some ASX listed uranium stocks have also been rising for a while. I was merely referring to the daily rises of yesterday.
2784 2018-07-28 01:48:45 Got look at my 401k, pension statement, and stocks 
2785 2018-07-28 01:48:36 Fiiiiiiine! Twitter Stocks go down. I am 10 years late. May as well buy stock the same day I sign up. Hah! #twitter #stocks #newbie @twitter @TheBrandonQuinn HELP ME DO THE TWITTERS BRANDON

2787 2018-07-28 01:47:19 Why are you lying and not giving the whole picture Bill? Obama had a higher quarterly GDP 4 times. Stocks are near all time highs because he inherited them there from Obama. Unemployment same damn thing. Hate crimes are up. And if Obama was Trump you’d be all about impeachment to
2788 2018-07-28 01:46:55 FB are down and out. Fucking shite and they deserve it. Watch it crash on their stocks. CEO is/was a twat, OK walks to the bank with lots of money, but unfortunately, end game. Suckerberg? It's a crime, a 'ponzi' scheme. It's totally 'insane', simple 2 do
2789 2018-07-28 01:46:53 Big glocks, no stocks know we keep sticks
2790 2018-07-28 01:46:42 Facebook found out what happens to stocks when you mess with the public. Time for Twitter to learn too! They also need jail time an confiscation of ALL ASSETS to pay for damages. They think fancy lawyers will protect them. Not when their licenses are at risk.
2791 2018-07-28 01:46:16 He didn’t blame the NRA for the shooting lol if you read the article you’d know this headline is just for clicks. He blamed the NRA for it being difficult to ban bump stocks
2792 2018-07-28 01:45:12 A few months ago I invested around $400 in stocks that I thought would do well and am interested in. Since that time, I have not withdrawn a single penny. It has risen to around $450, and right now it’s down to about $360. I’m devastated.
2793 2018-07-28 01:44:59 I really doubt that Alex Jones could ever be silenced. Facebook stocks drop 20%, then they suspend his account, how are the two connected? #conspiracy?

2796 2018-07-28 01:43:27 Thanks for keeping me off this #FF with @StuffaboutMpls . Until he stocks some decent Vikings gear for primates, he's dead to me.
2797 2018-07-28 01:42:24 Well... whatever stocks scale new highs will be in momentum, quality or not

2800 2018-07-28 01:41:32 Sincere question: do you think Warren Buffett did the right thing to avoid paying estate taxes by donating his fortune to the Gates Foundation, or does he do the right thing when he says rich people should pay more?
2801 2018-07-28 01:41:23 While stocks last, Ben!
2802 2018-07-28 01:41:12 Daytrading stocks seems CRAZY to me! And, I'm a former licensed stockbroker!
2803 2018-07-28 01:40:32 Yeah .. gotta change or their stocks will drop even more
2804 2018-07-28 01:39:54 I stay away as much as possible from Atomotive related stocks
2805 2018-07-28 01:39:49 You mean the same facebook that lost $15billion in stocks cause they aren't as popular?

Hmmmmmm wonder why????
2806 2018-07-28 01:39:16 I hope they have a lot of stocks

2810 2018-07-28 01:37:44 If the value of your assets rises faster than debts, then your accumulated savings is going up.  To fret about shares of current income flows "saved" rather than about net worth (stocks of assets minus liabilities) should never have been on anyone's worry list.
2811 2018-07-28 01:37:12 Facebook and Twitter stocks have dropped due to investigations. This has nothing to do with "lower users" or spending more on "Security". You'll see when it all comes out about the illegal stuff they both are doing.
2812 2018-07-28 01:36:14 Lion kills to eat. If it naps, hyena steals kill. No natural property rights. Humans create social contracts to impose win/win on nature. We pay for system allowing Kochs to "own" things as long as they contribute to general welfare. The 5%'s #GOP stooges are voiding contract.
2813 2018-07-28 01:35:00 Thank you! Hold their feet to the fire as we watch those stocks go DOWN! 
2814 2018-07-28 01:34:55 Heard on the news today that the stocks in T is going down & I think ppl are leaving T.
2815 2018-07-28 01:33:33 These are your false assumptions: 1) Twitter is the same kind of stock as Facebook 2) a 20% drop in a name that is overvalued by 500% is significant 3) I give a fuck about social media stocks
2816 2018-07-28 01:32:40 BREAKING: Shoe polish stocks on the rise!
2817 2018-07-28 01:32:11 Your just not trading the right stocks, I have been doing this for a year now and have grown my account by 400%, I analysts my own stocks and predict every move possible

2819 2018-07-28 01:31:47 Well, I can tell you that your stocks aren't going to look too healthy if you don't stop DISCRIMINATING  against conservatives. I'm dumping Twitter Stocks on Monday
2820 2018-07-28 01:31:42 Somebody sure as fuck paid billions to vulture contractors and pay offs in Iraq. Military industry stocks shot up due to all Armored vehicles and bombs they were producing .
2821 2018-07-28 01:31:29 economy isn’t as strong as one would believe. Corps look great in market b/c they are buying their own stocks with our tax $ given by repubs. Emplmnt % low b/c ppl are working in low wage jobs. 1000 bonus looks good but won’t last. Earnings dropping & costs of goods increasing
2822 2018-07-28 01:30:52 some will be shipping out this week, having some trouble with the wholesaler stocks we need to get more printed for all the orders trying to sort it all out so no definite eta on that but hopefully soon
2823 2018-07-28 01:30:50 Proctology is my game but stocks made my name.
2824 2018-07-28 01:30:24 My phone’s so dry I post slide up for a tbh and nobody even slides up. Post the ask a question thing on insta...nobody even asks a question. The only texts I have on my phone are from my mom and work. What does a man gotta do?
2825 2018-07-28 01:30:23 Yeah...the red states are rich and millionaires, they have many jobs,  many companies that r hiring them, they r all making over $100,000 a year, have plenty in their 401Ks, and have plenty of stocks with in Amazon, QQQ
2826 2018-07-28 01:29:09 Even if stocks rally for years (TBD), there will be numerous red days, pullbacks, and corrections along the way.  Video focuses on long-term trends.   Have a great weekend - CC
2827 2018-07-28 01:25:52 Facebook and Twitter decide to "clean up" AKA censor, their forums. both stocks drastically drop. Coincidence?
2828 2018-07-28 01:24:45 Debatable Since you can barely buy too many stocks with a small capital. It’s like 2 stocks of nvidia or 25 of AMD.
2829 2018-07-28 01:23:54 Come see me I got on stocks and socks
2830 2018-07-28 01:23:52 Doesn't that literally mean they put $ back into their own business, like they took the tax cuts & bought stocks back?
2831 2018-07-28 01:20:53 I love when sell off happens to good quality stocks like $fb. Picked up @ 164 sold at 179.
2832 2018-07-28 01:20:20 that's money she doesn't have to spend elsewhere. college, for example
2833 2018-07-28 01:18:07 3rd time was almost the charm. We took Zero and Kero to last game last 2 stocks. Almost made Grand Finals going 3-8 vs them. All Pika Mario vs. Mostly Pika Pika. Who needs SPK?
2834 2018-07-28 01:18:06 That’s why investing in stocks is risky. Every news can have detrimental effects.
2835 2018-07-28 01:16:09 Politicians shouldn't be allowed to own any stocks. They all do insider trading.

2837 2018-07-28 01:15:45 This is a market correction. All of these tech stocks that aren't making money are severely overvalued

2842 2018-07-28 01:14:17 The fact that you believe Bloomberg says a lot. I think the economy is great and no I'm not in the top 1%, not even close! Do you own any stocks? My 401k's up 60%+ since Trump took office!! #TGHW, TGHW, TGHW! @POTUS
2843 2018-07-28 01:14:05 its not good for their stocks, but Twitter is a private company, so they can do whatever they want - altho i don't agree with them.
2844 2018-07-28 01:13:14 Retail investors need to understand there are traders using Stockhouse to manipulate stocks.  The whole @stockhouse site should be suit down until they did this 'anonymous' poster problem

2846 2018-07-28 01:12:41 131). There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
2847 2018-07-28 01:12:30 It would be smart to sell any stocks in social media and the big 7 media.
2848 2018-07-28 01:12:24 I have an account that follows mainly liberals, progressives and socialists. Their primary diagnosis for Twitter's stocks being in free fall is: NOT ENOUGH CENSORSHIP!
2849 2018-07-28 01:10:33 With shit stocks like this you looks for market cap to get really low, like sub 5m but hard to tell with all the ATM dilution going on.

2851 2018-07-28 01:10:11 Close? And that’s why fb stocks dropped. Why I deleted my account.
2852 2018-07-28 01:09:56 Appears surpressing conservatives isn't so good for their stocks. 
2853 2018-07-28 01:09:54 I'm an investor not a trader. Most of my stocks I will own for life.
2854 2018-07-28 01:09:02 The govt takes almost 70% of her earnings. Sales tax is 25% That's not voluntary, it's mandatory. There's little left to choose with.
2855 2018-07-28 01:08:40 he doesn't care if he's not telling the truth. the1% got the money again just like the past decade. . if you cant afford stocks there has not been more money in your pocket. the tax cut gave me $11 more a week on a 50k yr job. costs and inflation are that up
2856 2018-07-28 01:07:52 It was just alot of articles about them running out of money and rheir stocks being real low lol
2857 2018-07-28 01:07:47 I don't use stops & I never will 1) bcuz I'm too diversified to care about any 1 individual stock 2) most of my money is in dividend paying stocks that I'll never sell (my children will inherit them) & 3) when my investments get cheaper, I buy more, not stop out @ horrible prices
2858 2018-07-28 01:07:41 Dont say trade crypto.  Just trust in the long term growth rate, it's the best and will be the most profitable play.  The gains you'll receive by holding this one out 5 years will far outweigh the intra monthly swings you try and get.  Day trade stocks, not this shit
2859 2018-07-28 01:06:40 @JasonMillerinDC You keep defending Comrade Trump as if he's the greatest  deficit doubled under Bush 43  Wall Street doubled under Obama  if corporate leaders were so upset with Obama how come stocks doubled  he also inherited a crashed economy oversaw by last (R) president
2860 2018-07-28 01:05:35 We need to get rid of the current management of Twitter.  They have not been honest with investors and have done damage to their share holders.  If they did this intentionally, then they are violating a commitment to those who put their money up to buy stocks.
2861 2018-07-28 01:05:34 Ran out of stocks e. Lagi din ako meron sa bag ko e. Ano tinetake mo?
2862 2018-07-28 01:05:32 by your definition, your Danish friend isn't being forced into the apartment/car decision either.
2863 2018-07-28 01:03:38 I know the reports say the economy is up, but my stocks aren't skyrocketing and neither is my 401K. He did manage to bring the 2026 World Cup to America, which he had to write letters to assure the president of FIFA that the 'ban' wouldn't affect qualifying countries. So yay.
2864 2018-07-28 01:02:11 NOT because they support President Trump and they're an IPO company which is why they're stocks will continue to free fall. pull out now, if you're in. 
2865 2018-07-28 01:00:13 Seoul stocks expected to show flat move http://30.1.1.228:8198/AEN20180727007500320
2866 2018-07-28 00:59:54 Not interested in gab. I will stay to watch Twitter's stocks plummet. I wonder if Jack noticed facebook's stoke take a nosedive?
2867 2018-07-28 00:59:38 College and grade school doesn’t teach stocks correctly, and they are foolish in not emphasizing the EXTREME importance of personal finance. It’s SO possible to make millions. People get impatient with stock prices because they’re taught a game instead of business.
2868 2018-07-28 00:59:34 Tech stocks can have big swings. I'll show you some charts tomorrow.
2869 2018-07-28 00:59:32 It's being corrected. Stocks are way down & @KimDotcom is creating a new site where we won't be censored.

2871 2018-07-28 00:58:57 What would be a similar analogy here? I don't understand the stock portion. Let's say alts rally w btc because of btc pairing, what are stocks secondarily linked to other than USD?
2872 2018-07-28 00:58:17 I guess this is why their stocks plunged 20% today.
2873 2018-07-28 00:57:58 The NRA name pops up every time there is a conversation on guns, leaving him to yes or no it. As soon as his answer was out it went public. It will take its toll but they got what they needed. If you remember the NRA endorsed doing away with bump stocks.
2874 2018-07-28 00:56:37 Sell 40 shares! Ya! Business. Stocks. Gold!

2878 2018-07-28 00:53:29 Tell me @jvn - why do you hate beards so much? You never let anyone keep them on @QueerEye and it upsets @km_stocks greatly.
2879 2018-07-28 00:52:05 Hit their stocks,  class action suits. Keep hitting them capitalist style.
2880 2018-07-28 00:50:47 Ppl that make the money buy the stocks your shooting urself in the foot. The ppl in their parents basement do buy stock. Connect the dots

2883 2018-07-28 00:48:54 Well when obama went into office stocks 7.9 after 18000. Unemployment was up 9 plus left 4.8. Health care people had it who never could afford it before.
2884 2018-07-28 00:47:28 The world got stocks wrong when they started worrying about the fluctuations of prices instead of the true value of the business. If a stock price falls and there is nothing happened to the business, that is just the market. Keep your shares.

2888 2018-07-28 00:41:20 TWITTER & FACEBOOK HAVE SHOT THEMSELVES IN FOOTS!  STOCKS SINKING!!  THAT IS WHAT U GET WHEN U CENSOR CONSERVATIVES.
2889 2018-07-28 00:40:46 Right after Zuckerberg lost $15 billion, now Twitter stocks are falling. Serves them right. Dear Twitter: there’s consequences to censoring free speech. Do you hear us now?
2890 2018-07-28 00:40:36 Lol, I’m Russian hahahahaha, that’s what you got? You are just mad because my post PROVES you lied when saying the NRA prevented regulation of bump stocks. Just admit you lied and free yourself
2891 2018-07-28 00:38:20 you know daiso? imagine having to deal with so many ppl and the stocks came..also bcos i was promoted to higher positions (when im new and not ready) the responsibilities is too much and i dont think i can handle it with my current mental state :/
2892 2018-07-28 00:38:19 Rather than worry about global warming think about all the money you’re making on your energy stocks by having to heat all winter AND cool all summer 
2893 2018-07-28 00:37:44 But what about assault straws?  What about bump stocks for straws?

And by God, will someone please think of all the Silly Straws?

Has some politician in CA been appointed Straw Boss?
2894 2018-07-28 00:37:05 Did I deny sharing stocks and tweeting good ones.  What is your point.
2895 2018-07-28 00:36:53 Sold off my Twitter stocks the day Milo got banned.   Been enjoying watching the free fall ever since.
2896 2018-07-28 00:35:46 High times is going public. Buy some stocks potheads
2897 2018-07-28 00:35:43 @ARTRADING125 alright I’m venting... these douches who retweet other douches that say nothing is happening in the market and the “opportunities” are just not there are seriously lost and dumb! TRADE REAL STOCKS YOU PANSY ASS LITTLE PRICKS!!!
2898 2018-07-28 00:33:20 Yeah thanks  $GT huge bounce today in @ $21.00 still holding
2899 2018-07-28 00:32:55 I'm thinking maybe some left coast lawmakers own stock in a few plastic straw manufacturers. I'm sure people are buying up straws like crazy! The stocks must be going through the roof!
2900 2018-07-28 00:32:50 Heck I will share stocks I believe will grow.  I can't influence anyone unless they want to be.  You were influenced because you responded.  That is on you.
2901 2018-07-28 00:31:45 Twitter and Facebook stocks down 20%. Is the boom about to end...
2902 2018-07-28 00:31:22 Twitter is loosing stocks with hitting customers with too much advertising!
2903 2018-07-28 00:29:56 Hi Mr President. @realDonaldTrump 

I have a small favour to ask.

Could you find out if Mark Zuckerberg sold any of his stocks prior to the stock crash please?

A couple of my friends want to know.

Kind regards

2907 2018-07-28 00:27:28 Actually, it *didn't impact earnings. Earnings beat expectations by a good margin.

2912 2018-07-28 00:24:48 My self and many others don't believe Twitter, when they say, "We don't Shadow Ban". As a result, I'm on it less, due to this practice. Low and behold....  stocks down 18%!
2913 2018-07-28 00:24:05 EVERYONE DROP YOUR STOCKS IN THESE ANTI AMERICAN COMPANIES LIKE A HOT POTATO! 
2914 2018-07-28 00:22:55 I kept on buying stocks until last week because Nasdaq was making new highs, although its choppiness meant the last 3 turned out to be losing trades. After that I couldn't find any new trades I felt comfortable with. Just 17% invested atm...
2915 2018-07-28 00:21:56 Their stocks going to go way down if you own any sell it now!
2916 2018-07-28 00:20:48 Yes they do and I’m sure FB users want their data protected and not mined! Some big things are going to happen or are already in the works! Did you hear, @Twitter stocks plunged 20% today! @jack is in the same boat with @finkd it’s a great day in America #MAGA
2917 2018-07-28 00:20:44 Let Twitter stocks plunge just like fakebook 
2918 2018-07-28 00:18:40 But then again you could be right but I don't think so nothing so far has pointed to Trump doing anything wrong whatsoever I think he's doing a bang up job I have more money in my pocket and NY savings and stocks have grown tremendously so what's not to like??
2919 2018-07-28 00:18:35 Your class warfare & hatred is missed place. Much of the stocks are held by union retirement funds & similar.  It hurts the average person the most.

2923 2018-07-28 00:16:14 They may know it but choose not to recognize it publicly. 
You know what I bet if one of them backed President Trump,  their stocks would skyrocket and they might actually be recognized as... REAL NEWS and REAL JOURNALIST,  what do you think? 
2924 2018-07-28 00:15:14 Not true for tech growth stocks. Member growth is key.
2925 2018-07-28 00:15:00 Insider dumping??  Means you and I with stocks will lose. GM did the same thing right before their bankruptcy. The bigshots in the company and the Union were given a heads up and sold, then the little people, myself included were notified. I lost $70,000 in stock i held.
2926 2018-07-28 00:14:26 Yes , man. I respect your passion for trading, you have the qualities to be a great trader. Just leave them random, manipulated low floats alone and transfer that hard work you do on them towards stocks 20> .
2927 2018-07-28 00:13:30 DOW is over-rated in its mix.  When DOW was going down, the stocks I held were holding steady or going up.  It's been "great" since the election.

2932 2018-07-28 00:11:02 No but the stock market has... No reason for the sell off, other than profit taking from the stocks that have risen so sharply the past year and a half.

2942 2018-07-28 00:00:21 For those that can’t find my tweets here is it for once and for all. 

I think about LONG term.. in my case that I split that up into 2 categories.

1. A 6-12 Month term
2. A lifetime term (think about bitcoin or stocks that pay dividend)

2984 2018-07-27 23:46:46 Exactly. Opening Chinook salmon fish hatcheries would help to restore the stocks, give to southern resident Orcas their main food supply and give sport fishery a supply for recreation and tourism. But, it will take a commitment from both the USA and Canadian side.
2985 2018-07-27 23:46:45 How about this...
Twitter- you’re going to have to ha fair piece to find one Conservative that isn’t boiling angry with them.

I’m considering buying stocks so that I can have them charged in some way for abusing investors. 

Yes. I’m that pissed.
2986 2018-07-27 23:46:41 Do corporations fine you for not buying their product? No. Can you sue a corporation? Yes. Can you sue government? Limited as they generally have sovereign immunity.

2989 2018-07-27 23:45:16 It's called wealth consolidation.

The tax scam for the 1%was used to buy back stocks.
2990 2018-07-27 23:45:11 He has zero idea of what Lenin did after he came to power to those who helped him. He also has zero understanding that time, labor, and money is something that individuals own and trade. They just want "free...on someone elses dime" lifestyle.
2991 2018-07-27 23:45:10 I heard no calves made it this year. They all died. There’s nothing for them to eat because the hippies forced the shutdown of so many hatcheries thinking the native fish stocks would come back. Plus puget sound is so toxic it’s just ridiculous

2993 2018-07-27 23:43:21 That's the thing, I believe he is "ok" with forcing others to serve his needs. He basically admitted it. He has no clue as to the Cold War and all that occurred. He has no idea of what the Berlin Wall was much less the Iron Curtain. He doesn't know what Stasi or KGB is.

2995 2018-07-27 23:42:53 Facebook and Twitter both seeing plunges in their stocks. Interesting..
2996 2018-07-27 23:42:31 Sheesh...some traders be like Isaac Hayes w/these stocks  "If loving you is wrong...I don't wanna be right." 

Identify w/trend. Can't figure out the trend & still want to trade? Set your risk before you enter. If you're wrong, get out w/capital for your next trade.
2997 2018-07-27 23:42:08 Time to invest in Canadian cannibas companies is now at its low ($6 a share) It legalizes October 17th. If you'd like help with it let me know and I can get you the app that'd get free stocks for both of us.
2998 2018-07-27 23:41:11 I hope you learn what "legal" is v. "Illegal".
2999 2018-07-27 23:40:48 24 hours later... Coca Cola stocks rise 8%
3000 2018-07-27 23:40:47 maybe, but when a rather big mkt cap stock like $TWTR goes from 17 to 47 in less than a yr, a lot of this stuff is priced in already. Nobody complains when stocks go up 20% on bad news, how come people get so upset when stocks go down on good news? Especially after huge runs
3001 2018-07-27 23:40:17 First Facebook stocks plummet. Now this.  Lol

3005 2018-07-27 23:37:54 TWT stocks fell almost 30% I am all in, lets invest for long term I don't think will drop more than 50%.
3006 2018-07-27 23:37:23 The stocks dropping on FB and Twitter....ummm
3007 2018-07-27 23:36:59 The reality is that gold sucks as investment, but there are times when stocks, bonds, real estate are overvalued, real rates are negative, and the USD is vulnerable. Then gold makes sense. That's kind of where we are now which is why I am long gold...
3008 2018-07-27 23:36:53 The whole market fell , Dow Nasdaq ...i bought the dip... I sold some Bonds & I bought some Weed & Gold Stocks & some essential Commodities   Going Moon. $BTC $XLM $ETC $ETH $BCH $ICX $LTC
3009 2018-07-27 23:36:25 If you own social media stocks you might want to consider dumping them asap...better to lose some money than all of it. Investors are spooked.

3011 2018-07-27 23:31:33 I actually trade stocks for a living so I do know exactly what I’m talking about but thanks loser.
3012 2018-07-27 23:30:47 We pride ourselves on quality stocks with huge potential.
3013 2018-07-27 23:30:45 there are plenty of people facing the same and similar choices as your Danish friend in America, no?
3014 2018-07-27 23:30:44 Amazing what crashing stocks will bring about.
3015 2018-07-27 23:30:00 The fact that so many analysts have this as a buy is mind boggling. This stock is literally a pig. Not only that, but the shares themselves are basically tracking stocks because common shares have no voting rights. It’s a pig.
3016 2018-07-27 23:29:19 As bad as Trump is I doubt he would tolerate the mismanagement of Atlantic Fish stocks such as has happened through Fedfish and Foreign Affaires officials. Not to say some locals have not been complicit  with them for access and grants and subsidies.
3017 2018-07-27 23:28:56 The stock market has peaked, Everything is red-hot, just like 2007. Soon, the crash will come.I sold all my stocks and put them in cash a...
3018 2018-07-27 23:27:55 And by govt dictate, my "choices" of insurance products are extremely limited, outrageously expensive, and don't meet my wants or needs.
3019 2018-07-27 23:27:26 #nasdaq Seems like immediate top made in FAANG stocks. Negative RSI divergence in #nasdaqcomposite. 7650 is TL support level for Monday. If broken then Nasdaq will take long time to hit fresh highs
3020 2018-07-27 23:26:43 I just talked w my boss about stocks and retrograde and the eclipse and she thinks I’m a weirdo :(
3021 2018-07-27 23:26:26 Except for Obamacare, where our govt forces us to buy the products of an insurance corporation, what other transactions with corporations are mandatory?
3022 2018-07-27 23:25:33 GDP up, but stocks down. What does it mean? GDP rose due to buying frenzy before tariffs hit and stock down because tariffs have hit. Your economy is about to head into a recession and it only took you 18 mo despite of tax cut boost to large corporations
3023 2018-07-27 23:24:30 So great to see the #lttu v2.0 stocks now arriving. 
Flooding the interwaves with <3 = LOVE 

Keep them coming so I can keep on sharing! 
3024 2018-07-27 23:23:51 And my 401k is flat this year, and so are stocks YTD. We’ll see if tax cut REALLY helps, or if it was excitement over Trump.
3025 2018-07-27 23:21:51  So much WINNING!! People are going back to work, getting OFF of welfare, the economy is booming, GDP is at 4.1%, .....FB & Twitter stocks are down & American Pride is UP!!

3026 2018-07-27 23:21:43 Have you in total over the years made a profit from investing in stocks? I would think so but I am really curios.
3027 2018-07-27 23:21:41 Been a rough week for social media stocks
3028 2018-07-27 23:21:17 Where is my raise or bonus? Oh right, Large Corporations bought their stocks back.
3029 2018-07-27 23:20:56 Big tech stocks have been taking quite the dive recently: Twitter, Facebook, and Netflix  
3030 2018-07-27 23:20:26 Early in thread.His reply to burden on MDs:

No - invest in broadly diversified mutual funds that have lots of stocks, or in individual stocks other than health care, or at least not health care companies affected by your professional recommendations to patients. Not that hard...
3031 2018-07-27 23:18:11 Facebook and Twitter stocks dropped 20+ percent since President Trump called their practices into question.

Conservatives buy stocks too. Stop censoring them!
3032 2018-07-27 23:17:13 so you're okay with corporations forcing that choice on you?
3033 2018-07-27 23:16:50 With all these stocks literally crashing down like #Facebook & #Twitter I think the market is more need of #Crypto ETFs, just give people another option to invest in. Crypto is a so raw that big investors would die for it. #Bitcoin #Ethereum #XRP $BTC $ETH $XRP $ADA
3034 2018-07-27 23:16:49 FB & Twitter r cleaning up their act & removing fake accts. Their stocks drop. Hmm I smell a Russian in here somewhere

3038 2018-07-27 23:14:32 Kind of a cluttered week, took small profits on biotech stocks only to get back in at lower prices after today's dip. Also got some $FB today. Holding $MU $ADOBE $AMZN

3042 2018-07-27 23:12:04 I agree about forcing those sacrifices on others, but I wonder if he is okay w/that? Some of us are old enough to remember the people shot and killed while attempting to climb the Berlin wall, but if you aren't old enough, perhaps you do believe the "free" stuff really is free.
3043 2018-07-27 23:12:02 I wonder if this brings with it the prospect of 'rationing' by the big supermarkets in order to safeguard their stocks?
3044 2018-07-27 23:11:51 Facebook hit a big low in their stocks just cause nobody uses fb as much anymore. that’s wtf they cat ass get

3050 2018-07-27 23:08:50 Does that include "investment" in their own stocks?
Because that's where most of the tax cuts went.
3051 2018-07-27 23:07:37 Think about this. Facebook and Twitter stocks are down in a 4.1% GDP economy. Turns out #censorship is bad for business.
3052 2018-07-27 23:06:41 Pwease give me ur stocks
3053 2018-07-27 23:05:31 Stocks respond negatively to changes with unknown outcomes. These moves I think are good for the company long term, and even not so long term. These stocks could rebound swiftly, and creating an environment free of hatespeech may attract more users and more frequent users.

3055 2018-07-27 23:03:17 Not sure where you learned economics but it's a lot better to buy extremely low and have stocks soar than to invest highly and get expected return

3057 2018-07-27 23:02:30 $AWX Yup these low float stocks doing the late 1999 thing, On my radar next week are $AXON, low float and 28% short, and these just posted by a trader below $STAF $MTSL $LEDS $XBIO $WMLP $OPHC $SEII
3058 2018-07-27 23:02:05 I feel the same. You don't need to be into stocks or charts to appreciate it.
3059 2018-07-27 23:01:55 @PlayhardorGohome ... We focus on blue chips, large/mega caps, high ATR stocks and qualified ETFs.
3060 2018-07-27 23:01:19 Haha wonder of that Nobel prize winning economist was the same guy who said the stock market would crash and never recover when trump won.  Recommended selling all your stocks asap.  That you @paulkrugman ? 
3061 2018-07-27 23:00:54 Killing almost 60 and injuring over 800 people. Yea just bump stocks. And San Bernardino could have been prevented if we got rid of gun show loop hole...
3062 2018-07-27 23:00:44 Group qualifying is in the books! Fast qualifiers:

V8 Stocks: Fothergill
Bone Stocks: Brekelmans
Late Models: Jake Sheridan
3063 2018-07-27 23:00:29 Remember these are the same people whose “expert economists” predicted stocks would crash and burn should Trump be elected and “no way” would GDP ever get to 4%.
3064 2018-07-27 22:59:56 Lo cambios recientes en la composición del act y pas del BCRA (baja del stock de Lebacs) tienen efectos mucho más importantes hacia adelante: impactan sobre flujos. El ajuste contable solo blanquea algo q ya se sabía sobre los stocks
3065 2018-07-27 22:59:39 Extensive background checks,see that this man had already bought 20 some already. Limit the amount 1 can own. & “except bump stocks”? Like that’s a minimal reason for the mass shooting. It was everything to do abt that. He had over 12 AR’s outfitted w/em, which made it capable of
3066 2018-07-27 22:59:29 Name one thing Obama  did?????nothing...Obama care...what a joke..how can he have his name on it...Trump has done more..I love how high my stocks r.....
3067 2018-07-27 22:58:49 Steyer has run a hedge fund that is akin to Gordon Gecko wealth! He has never built a business that provides a product! Success is the product of failure! You manipulate fossil fuels to benefit your manipulation of solar stocks! Steyer is the poster boy of little man syndrome!
3068 2018-07-27 22:58:27 Today was so mature. 
I looked at lofts on Pinterest, went to Michael's for art supplies, shot/edited pix, now I'm discussing stocks.
3069 2018-07-27 22:58:18 index ... (industrials maybe?) like FIDU (above 8% rtrn) 
Stay a-w-a-y from all social@media stocks.
FB closed down an extra 1.78 on top of yuge crash ...
NOT a buy (yet)
3070 2018-07-27 22:57:56 Twitter's stocks dropped 20% today, due mostly to privacy laws in Europe. It's Facebook that should go down until it bottoms out & the BoD fires #TraitorZuckerberg, not Twitter. Twitter's essential to this #Resister. I need it for support and to learn.
3071 2018-07-27 22:57:50 #twitter #facebook you guys hang around pretty much with the same group of people that think like you. Your group of people hate: #Conservatives #Republicans #independant thought however there are many of us. Keep dissing us your stocks will speak volumes 
3072 2018-07-27 22:56:48 And oh BTW the Repubs seem to have short term memory loss of the time when Obama stepped into ten feet of doo doo the day he took office, fed bank collapse, stocks, American auto collapse, you name it..he lead ALL of us back out with great leadership...there fixed it for them...
3073 2018-07-27 22:55:25 Yes and when the Bush Jr Great Recession hit, the government bailed out industries by buying their stocks then sold later on once they recovered. Don't forget the Trillions of dollars the Fed put into that permitted loans to bigger banks to consolidate at interest of 0.000001%
3074 2018-07-27 22:54:46 Thanks! Twittter must like their stocks in the trash can b/c they’re next.
3075 2018-07-27 22:53:20 I would love to see twitter and Facebook stocks drop to pennies!
3076 2018-07-27 22:53:08 Any person who chooses the former should be put in stocks in the center of their respective city/town for no less then 3 business days. Throwing of produce permissable
3077 2018-07-27 22:52:27 And if the markets don't like it, they can short their stocks, and their customers can leave.

Laissez Faire.

But if a Corp intends to deceive, all bets are off.

Tort Law.

Oh. Wait.
3078 2018-07-27 22:51:18 Josh (complaining about how trashy the fair is & how he hates it) “who wants to talk about who’s pig is bigger or who’s tractor is gonna blow up??”

Josh’s mom- “well who wants to talk about stocks all the time?!?”

 I’m crying
3079 2018-07-27 22:50:33 At Least stocks drop for a reason. Bitcoin can move 5% in either direction with no news on a whim
3080 2018-07-27 22:48:44 WOW!!  QAnon called the fall in stocks of Facebook and Twitter (social media platforms) back in March. Glad I didn't invest in what seemed to be a sure thing.
3081 2018-07-27 22:48:33 Is it possible to own stocks in Morley’s yet?
3082 2018-07-27 22:48:26 EZ shares +0.5% (+1.7% for wk), US shares -0.7% (+0.6% wk) as Facebook & Twitter misses weigh on tech stocks (Nasdaq -1.5%).
US 10 yr yld -2bp to 2.95%
Oil -1.3% to 68.7, gold +0.1%, iron ore +0.3% to $64.32
ASX futures -0.4% => soft start Mon
$A 0.7391 as $US index -0.1%
3083 2018-07-27 22:47:16 That’s what I’m saying, but he chose to take the company public and only hold 29% of the stocks he could’ve avoided this, he really just shouldn’t have said what he said whether he was speaking in quotations or not it’s 2018 nobody plays that sht
3084 2018-07-27 22:45:48 Are you aware that the richest 10% own over 80% of the stocks? The market means absolutely nothing to the middle class & even less to our lower classes. Another statistics 28% of the electorate are Republicans and 38% of them think education is a waste is time. #cheating
3085 2018-07-27 22:45:24  Check these #stocks that reached record highs: $JKHY, $GOOG, $MTBCP, $AER, $SQ, $SPSC, $TEAM, $INFO, $NSP
3086 2018-07-27 22:45:24 3 energy stocks made a big climb on Friday:
$NOV 10.3%, $INT 21.0%, $NR 10.9%
3087 2018-07-27 22:44:52 I hope you learn compassion, Jeff.
3088 2018-07-27 22:44:50 Today I:
• made 135 glycerol stocks of 12 different transformations
• MANUALLY buffer exchanged 40 mL of protein
• sonicated 18 diff cultures (there were no ear protectors)
• made and ran 5 sds-page gels
• concentrated my protein from 35 mL solution
3089 2018-07-27 22:43:36 STELLA FACTION stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
3090 2018-07-27 22:43:26 I really hope that the Twitter CEO says even more stupid comments so then the sjws will get pissed off and the stocks will plummet just like Facebook stock plummeted just recently maybe with less SJWS the better.
3091 2018-07-27 22:43:25 They did yesterday. The same time their stocks went down
3092 2018-07-27 22:43:11 I see many traders put large sum of money in sub penny stocks. They stay with their losses holding for more than a YEAR! This must be stopped and you must move on! Hope is not a strategy!!!
3093 2018-07-27 22:43:03 Whatever they are doing, they are doing it wrong, I think. Gems of the bizarre like this one will surely help the falling Twitter stocks.
3094 2018-07-27 22:41:32 One of my girlfriends lost stock this morning... She called her stock person and was told they were sent a email last night that stocks would tank today and LARGE holders dumped their stocks last night......

3096 2018-07-27 22:41:10 I have been hyping Trx to everyone I know and people who ask me about stocks and cryptocurrencies.  I am sure a lot of people have invested in Trx but I am beginning to feel bad with the direction it has been going in. I always say it's a long term investment but still....
3097 2018-07-27 22:40:22 These are the 14 stocks in finance sector that yesterday reached all-time highs:
$TRMK, $AXP, $AFL, $KKR, $SIVB, $EFSC, $EFC, $KBLM, $AJG, $CBRE, $UNTY, $EMCF, $AIZ, $UFCS
3098 2018-07-27 22:40:22  Check these #stocks that hit all-time highs: $PHG, $TOT, $EOG
3099 2018-07-27 22:39:18 What? Those penny stocks are cheaper up front. I'd rather have a ton of great players being paid 1 mil or less per year than ones being paid 6 mil+. Those big money players encompass two rounds. If you hit on the other five, that's phenomenal drafting.
3100 2018-07-27 22:37:28 Back to back days of 20% declines for FB and TWTR.  Maybe the footing isn’t so solid among these high flying tech stocks?

3102 2018-07-27 22:34:46 @Twitter shares drop 20% the day after @facebook falls 19%. Not a good week for social media stocks or my wallet. #comeback #BullMarket
3103 2018-07-27 22:34:34 Lots of “news” on various places (radio, FoxBusiness)just repeating Twitter news release about purging fake accounts instead of investigating/reporting Twitter shadow bans Conservatives and that’s why stocks fell
3104 2018-07-27 22:33:37 This was my concern from day 1.  Selling behind closed doors.   I’ll follow price of stocks.  So far volume is coming into my stocks@so I like them. Goviex is my spec
3105 2018-07-27 22:33:29 To be honest with you I am 95% into crypto. I think stocks especially penny stocks are for the birds. The more I learn about blockchain technology and crypto the more I forget Wall Street still exists. This is why I believe crypto will never go to zero. It's a mental virus.
3106 2018-07-27 22:32:52 Bonnes ou très bonnes, tu ne te sentirais pas un peu... humilié, si le don de 100 tonnes de dattes par un autre pays faisait l'objet d'un reportage dithyrambique au journal de 20h30 de ton pays ? Le prochain coup ce sera quoi ? Des stocks de caleçons usagés ?
3107 2018-07-27 22:32:07 Any advice on how to get started? I'm doing ecommerce and FB Ads currently (beginner as well), I want to do stocks as well. U think I should focus on Ecom or do multiple things right now? Learning from u and other Knowledge ppl with skin in the game! 
3108 2018-07-27 22:31:23 Sounds like stocks rallied into the number and sold the news.  When you manage real money, that's a viable strategy.
3109 2018-07-27 22:30:22 @JimInvestor i have the same worries too, but it makes scalping tech stocks nowadays works so well, price action volatile af like pennies

3114 2018-07-27 22:22:51 Thank you Mr. President for working so hard for us 24/7.
You are the best @POTUS EVER!
My retirement stocks are making money for me again after a disastrous 8 years. 

3115 2018-07-27 22:21:06 Neither Russia or Iran (China), want a war, but when the world’s largest military power is stuck in a bipartisan wormhole those are the two choices you seem to get, and careers/stocks are depending on both
3116 2018-07-27 22:19:13 "The key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them."
3117 2018-07-27 22:18:32 Why are social media stocks falling? Because SMERSH and CHAOS investors decided they could no longer manipulate the masses with bots anymore?
3118 2018-07-27 22:18:08 I got into stocks by losing a bunch of money buying bs energy companies in early 2016... Tips would be to buy broad index ETF's (spy, voo, dia, etc) until you know what you're doing. I learned a TON from my internship and my current job
3119 2018-07-27 22:17:36 @facebook I want to know why I'm being punished because Internet trolls found a way to manipulate your automated system. Why am I on a 7 day ban for no reason, still?  Your stocks might do better if you treat businesses and people better.

3121 2018-07-27 22:17:05 The way y'all are correcting stocks with circa 20% devals in one day...

3123 2018-07-27 22:16:09 Ok, Twitter and Facebook stocks drop 20%. CNN rating sink and people prefer to watch Mr. Ed the talking horse over CNN. So how long will it take for the idea that screwing over Conservatives is not a good idea?
3124 2018-07-27 22:15:53 LIE: JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!

FACT: Worker pay in the 2Q dropped nearly one percent below its 1Q level.

FACT: Wages fell 1.4 percent from 2017, effecting 80% of industries & 2/3 of metro areas affected.

FACT: Worker wages drop while companies spend $700 billion to boost stocks
3125 2018-07-27 22:15:36 @united gives free flights to illegal aliens but eliminates long standing discounts for NRA members? Any doubt where their politics lie? #BoycottUnitedAirlines and watch their stocks go the way of @Twitter and @facebook! 
3126 2018-07-27 22:15:12 Social media stocks were always overpriced and their vulnerability to sudden loss of reputation and popularity was never seriously considered by the investors and traders. I can write a single article on NYT and cause millions of users slow down their usage w/o any false claim

—4.5% Q4 2009
3133 2018-07-27 22:12:10 The reason why Twitter an Facebook stocks are dropping like rocks is because the CIA, NSA an FBI funds are drying up.
What?
You thought these ppl got paid directly  
Can't make it easy to follow the money.

3136 2018-07-27 22:10:53 Unfunded no strings tax cuts to corporations with record profits who use the $ to buy back their own stocks doesn't help the 1/2 of America with no investments at all.

3139 2018-07-27 22:09:45 I'd like to know how many members of the senate and congress owned stock in the companies that make the foreign goods, of which they just cut the tariffs! They should not be allowed to own stocks in anything outside of U.S. Conflict of interest! AMERICA FIRST!
3140 2018-07-27 22:09:23 @Twitter stocks is taking a big nose dive it 20% hey twitter you should never shadow banned Republicans or the president i bet you feel dumb now and regret it but to late now
3141 2018-07-27 22:09:11 Big difference: 
$AMC makes money and is making payments on their debt
$HMNY losses buckets of money every day.
3142 2018-07-27 22:08:34 Facebook and Twitter stocks dive 20%? I guess that's karma.

3144 2018-07-27 22:05:38 BUY THE DIP. @Twitter stocks dumped. Due to people not using  it as much. And we all know Twitter takes off when $btc and #Crypto takes off.
3145 2018-07-27 22:05:26 Last week it looked like small stocks were in comeback mode, retaking mkt momentum from big stocks. This week, just the opposite. Russell 2000 small-stock index -2.0% for week vs S&P 500 +0.6%, Dow +1.6%.

Last 30 days:

Dow +4.9%
S&P +3.7
Russell 2000 +1.2
S&P midcap +1.2

3148 2018-07-27 22:02:49 LOL. If only I could buy stocks and invest money. Then, I’d REALLY amass a fortune.
3149 2018-07-27 22:02:41 #BoldandBeautiful since Steffi has the stocks that she needs she will  fire  Hopel LOL
3150 2018-07-27 22:01:58 In growth stocks, there is an expectation, which can be difficult to fulfill.  It’s usually baked into the stock’s price.  The realization that many of accounts, which it’s valuation was based, could be fake is not going to help the stock price.
3151 2018-07-27 22:01:54 It is proof some brokers and analysts don’t actually read up on the stocks they trade - it was hardly a secret that @Twitter was deleting fake accounts
3152 2018-07-27 22:01:49 I’m fighting in the Senate to take action on gun violence. I’m proud to have co-sponsored bills to:

3159 2018-07-27 21:59:38 I have been trying to find how stocks for CNN, MSNBC, GOOGLE  etc are doing BUT SADLY, THERE IS NO INFO. 

OOOPS, LET US CALL IT BY FAITH DONE, DONE AND DONE!
3160 2018-07-27 21:59:15 Nice chart. I sold my coal (arch and $btu)a few months ago. Holding nickel, zinc, gold, silver and copper stocks. Looking at uranium...
3161 2018-07-27 21:58:12 He is okay with that. What's worrisome is the part where is he ok with forcing those sacrifices on others....
3162 2018-07-27 21:57:33 Looks like I need to research what happened with $GBR because I'm not familiar.
3163 2018-07-27 21:57:23 Who's going to pay for it, junior? You? Good luck...
3164 2018-07-27 21:57:03 From 1Q 2011 to 4Q 2017, a vast majority of $SPY co’s (avg 65% during that period) cut EPS ests in EVERY earnings season. Stocks did fine. Today, 2H18 ests are holding steady & FY19 EPS ests are inching higher. Whoever said guidance is poor hasn’t been following overall trends
3165 2018-07-27 21:56:40 If the sun comes up oil stocks drop
3166 2018-07-27 21:55:58 Because they pay DIVIDENDS & BRIBES to politicians and those politicians are invested in Wall St & stocks that pay them handsomely...a qet rich quick scheme for politicians... Regulations protect the people FROM corporations greed to harm; now removed.
3167 2018-07-27 21:54:59 To be fair, I have some pot stocks too and I loves them.
3168 2018-07-27 21:54:30 Nope I live on an island in Canada. Only thing I ever hear about is old fuddie duddies talking about their pot stocks. It's never happened, but my friends when they come over and see mining equipment are full of questions.
3169 2018-07-27 21:54:02 Time to sell the growth stocks - bizarre really
3170 2018-07-27 21:53:01 Ask him how many stocks he owns went up today? It was a bloodbath in biotech world not to mention tech stocks including his Twitter play.
3171 2018-07-27 21:52:59 Facebook stocks dipped.. Who’s copping before it moves up, exercise & make that mula .
3172 2018-07-27 21:52:40 Definitely a lot more estrogen in crypto than stocks. Keeps my bank balance in 7 digits
3173 2018-07-27 21:51:44 Nope, he is working well for us 24/7
So happy my stocks are gainin again after an abysmal 8 years.
3174 2018-07-27 21:51:05 @realDonaldTrump comes out and says the economy is doing great and stocks fall all over.   That says a lot.   You come out with great news you think and American BUISNESS MEN say not so fast.   @tedlieu @jaketapper @foxandfriends
3175 2018-07-27 21:50:19 Although stocks were down today, they still closed higher for the week. Just another Friday in the summer
3176 2018-07-27 21:50:04 ive always said this type of person is what got Trump elected. Sigh gotta watch my stocks even closer for the next 6 years i suppose.
3177 2018-07-27 21:49:39 Don’t get me wrong I’ll still watch a small cap if the setup is really nice and clean but for me personally the “big boy stocks” just move cleaner and you still catch a lot of points

3183 2018-07-27 21:46:05 That’s actually where Jim Chanos came into play b/c he mostly shorted stocks that were financial businesses & SC was essentially a lender. Tesla could have let another company buy SC and create competition or buy them and get access to their Buffalo govt subsidies. Smart move IMO
3184 2018-07-27 21:45:01 Can someone go infiltrate the education system and introduce courses for things that are yknow, actually useful in life like mortgages, insurances, extensive career options, stocks, investments etc etc?? but don’t worry I’ve gotten SOO much usage out of remembering y=mx+c

3190 2018-07-27 21:39:46 Thank God I cant afford to invest in Facebook stocks
3191 2018-07-27 21:39:39 Driven by the 1% & Corporations buying back their stocks and minimum wage jobs under 30 hour work week that will be gone in fall. Shameful unethical behavior of GOP legislators to declare success on availability of seasonal employment
3192 2018-07-27 21:39:30 Even if they do go away, expect a crash, at least short term, as businesses use up stocks bought in anticipation of tarrifs.
3193 2018-07-27 21:38:58 It didn't in 2008. Gold isn't going much lower imho unless we get a #crash in stocks and the dollar spikes against the yuan OR we get a maxi one-off devaluation of the yuan by China that triggers the crash. The latter would signal the beginning of the massive rally for #Gold.
3194 2018-07-27 21:38:16 $HMNY bounce nice 
3195 2018-07-27 21:37:47 How I make money in the stock market: 
1) Buy under valued, dividend paying stocks.
2) Sell safe options (covered calls) against my position.
3) Wait for the market to panic (and there is ALWAYS a panic).
4) Laugh when the market panics.
5) Cash in.
6) Start over.
3196 2018-07-27 21:37:45 This wasn't a fluke,
or an accident,
or 'the economy'.

It was deliberate wealth extraction from the 99%: make money selling off crap mortgages, make more buying up devalued stocks and real estate after the crash.

It's IN PROGRESS RIGHT NOW, with Brexit, & coming again, here.
3197 2018-07-27 21:37:11 Wrong math . Stocks are non stationary variable
3198 2018-07-27 21:36:27 Imagine a world where active managers, as a whole, had made the same allocations to various stocks as being done by the various ETFs i.e. replace each ETF with an active manager sitting at h(er/is) desk and trading the underlying stocks. Why is the latter somehow less risky?
3199 2018-07-27 21:36:24 Mooch, any hot takes on stocks?

3243 2018-07-27 21:13:10 Is the complexity of it the point? There are stocks with intentionally convoluted contracts for the simple reason that the more complex the stock can be made, the more chance one has of playing the stock for half a bip before someone else sees you buy it and checks it out.

3287 2018-07-27 20:58:14 Teachers, firefighters, sanitation workers, and all other public employees have a pension fund invested in stocks, in addition to any other savings plans. 
I’m not saying every single employee is a shareholder, but to say there is no overlap between the two groups is not correct

The economy is about more real goods and services, not more inflation.

People notice when their income buys less stuff. 

Obama faked GDP growth, so is Trump.

People still notice their income buys less.
3295 2018-07-27 20:56:22 Back to the QC! Had fun on my #Daycation s/o to Mike Stocks 
3296 2018-07-27 20:55:59 Both Elon musk and Steve jobs recieve/received 1 usd a month but they were both very wealthy and that’s because they had stocks. You only pay taxes on stocks when they are sold so of course rich people can pay less taxes.
3297 2018-07-27 20:55:47 all these boomer stocks are crashing, bitcoin etf is coming, money from stock market shorts flow into crypto, i like this timeline

3299 2018-07-27 20:54:41 buy weed stocks, thank me later
3300 2018-07-27 20:54:36 Ross, never one to leave as hominem out of a discussion about stocks.
3301 2018-07-27 20:54:21 This is more reason @JeffBezos should share the wealth.  Steve Jobs gave the Apple service and cafetria crew Apple stocks before he launched the iPod
3302 2018-07-27 20:54:03 Corporations are buying back stocks, hence the stick market is moving up
3303 2018-07-27 20:53:54 Stocks slump to end the week, shaking off positive GDP data. Tech names lead the declines $TWTR $INTC $FB. Will the tech fallout continue next week, or is it a buying opportunity? LMK! #CheddarLIVE

3308 2018-07-27 20:52:23 That's what happens when stocks are based on perceived value.  There's no way investors could ever understand the value of a company like Facebook.  Even Facebook doesn't know/can't explain what Facebook is worth.  <whispers>Because it's not actually worth anything.</whispers>

3311 2018-07-27 20:51:40 Consider it as an investment you can hit on this many penny stocks as you want but if you lose on your big cash cows you have not done a very good job of investing money despite the returns. Very few teams have 3 top 5 picks in a row four if you count Ramsey

3315 2018-07-27 20:47:49 How can @twitter and @Facebook stocks both be down 25% in a 4.1 GDP economy ? 
3316 2018-07-27 20:47:35 @T2Boykin What's up man-I just wanted to wish you the best during these tough times. As someone who already had it all, lost it all and got it back again it would be wise once your back in the league to invest your money in dividend stocks.  Let your $ make you $.  All the best
3317 2018-07-27 20:47:35 Isn't aud more likely to fall significantly during the next global shock along with US stocks?
3318 2018-07-27 20:46:40 This whole Facebook and Twitter stock price looks like a lot of insider trading to me with stocks being sold off. Something is going on and the wider public does not know exactly what. Yet.
3319 2018-07-27 20:46:27 My stocks says much different!
3320 2018-07-27 20:46:23 $INTC. Ignore earnings dates at your own peril. We alert people to earnings dates constantly. #stocks #earnings

3325 2018-07-27 20:43:04 @RealJamesWoods you should get out of the #poker business and pick #stocks to dump. You were dead on with dumping #twitter yesterday.
3326 2018-07-27 20:42:47 Well seen as though we all take personal responsibility for our investments, I mean we are all adults here choosing to trade a) on AIM and b) on a junior explorer so what’s to be expected on high risk penny stocks. Grow up will you and let us all get on with it.

3330 2018-07-27 20:41:55 Yes because every company guarantees returns in their stocks, no matter what. You don’t need to research what a company actually produces either, just buy and reap the rewards forever.
3331 2018-07-27 20:41:18 Facebook loses 16.8 Billion. Twitter stock down 20% today. And they believed conservatives have no power. Think again, Jack, Mark - who the hell do you think has the money to buy those stocks? Who do you think OWNS YOU? People who actually work, that's who! Not student socialists
3332 2018-07-27 20:40:55 Couple of key differences that I see, US holding bigger share of exporter stocks and export numbers in USDA July looking overs in Eu, Ru and Aus (maybe -15mmt??) Sure demand can change but at $5 wheat I doubt it changes much. Curious who fills export gaps on wheat.

Today is an extremely blessed day
3335 2018-07-27 20:39:58 First stock I ever bought was moviepass and now the CEO will probably go to jail for fraud and I lost a ton of $. Stocks r cool.
3336 2018-07-27 20:39:54 Twitter and Facebook's stock rise and fall, those are very small highs and lows, they're short term impacts. It will recover, facebook will probably take more time though. When it comes to stocks, you gotta see things long term. A year from now, they will both have grown a bunch.
3337 2018-07-27 20:39:25 $SPX -0.7% day, +0.6% week

Japan CPI jumps to +0.9%
and BoJ lets 10yr yld rise again
3338 2018-07-27 20:39:10 I guess store closings and the present drops in tech stocks won't slow the economy or have a negative effect?
3339 2018-07-27 20:38:52 I live the idea of stocks. Pumpkin season is coming and lobbing one that’s all squishy from sitting in the sun just might make up for the last two years of hell.
3340 2018-07-27 20:38:50 To the first combo... There's no "illegal" in friendlies, so don't try this at home if you're lower on stocks; she can almost indefinitely side-b.
3341 2018-07-27 20:38:27 RT @Bradley92441872: @philkillerlain I've said it before and I'll say it again I hope all these ATA backing piece of crap companies stocks go down the toilet!! #eldorme #ELDMandate
3342 2018-07-27 20:37:44 that private business investment includes them buying their own stocks with your taxcuts, doesn't it?
3343 2018-07-27 20:36:39 It starts now the Trump Dump. Your world come crashing down. Economy in the toilet stocks drop family Indicted of crappers it all down in the pit from here forward. Good bye Donny@
3344 2018-07-27 20:36:37 Falling stocks are not allowed.
3345 2018-07-27 20:36:15 We both know that today's tech stocks are not the tech stocks of 2000.  But yes, time will tell.
3346 2018-07-27 20:35:43 Social media stocks crashing in back-2-back days. Turns out this interwebs thing is harder to monetize than we’ve been told...who woulda thunk it?

3348 2018-07-27 20:35:16 In which order does not bother me, so long as they don`t miss out the Trump...I want to see him Bankrupt, and permanently this time....and in stocks will do.
3349 2018-07-27 20:34:42 Ironic that you're using the outstanding debt of $AMC, a company HMNY relies on to stay in business, to defend $HMNY's own viability for survival.

3360 2018-07-27 20:31:28 @Playforprofit21 @marketupdate this is common for these stocks followed by large rallies
3361 2018-07-27 20:31:10 Childishness on the part of the Nazi leftists. They will loose.  #MAGA Can't wait for their stocks to tank
3362 2018-07-27 20:30:56 You're effectively playing the semantics game of many a hapless politician.

"Hold on, we didn't outright say 'we're stockpiling food', goodness no. We merely served notices to supermarket chains recommending they keep their food stocks piled high."
3363 2018-07-27 20:30:37 BRALETTES ARE SOLD OUT. NEW STOCKS COME IN NEXT WEEK.
3364 2018-07-27 20:30:34 Wages aren't rising in line with inflation, all the money from the ill-advised tax cut is going to richest who don't need it. Also most stocks are owned by a small part of the US population. GO BETO
3365 2018-07-27 20:30:32 …returns turns out to be correct (seems too optimistic to me), most people own one home &, hence, are betting it all on a single horse. That's NOT a diversified investment. No one would say "stocks are likely to return X% over the next 15 years, so go buy a single stock." 2/3
3366 2018-07-27 20:29:03 Facebook/Twitter stocks plunging, because user numbers are dropping. Shadow banning and biased algorithms working against conservatives voices is not helping. Why chase away half the country if you’re looking to increase numbers?
3367 2018-07-27 20:28:26 Waiting for a Back To The Future spin-off centered around someone going back in time purely to invest in Amazon stocks.
3368 2018-07-27 20:28:18 the media and democrats all said the stocks would fall and we would be in a recession they said the president could not ever get it over 2 percent.He proved every one wrong and this will help in the elections in Nov and 2020
3369 2018-07-27 20:28:02 So we should all like ignore the umm like "homebuilders stocks" #bullmarket2018
3370 2018-07-27 20:28:01 Nah, I’ve never heard of him either. I try my best to be fair and give credit when it’s due. Yay for Econ growth , I just want more of the Corp guys to give back to their WORKERS instead of just buying back their stocks, cause happier workers = better morale &  productivity
3371 2018-07-27 20:27:56 sometimes steady 8% is better then high risk stocks
3372 2018-07-27 20:27:53 Stocks don't help workers afford rent or food for their families or medical bills that are inevitable. The working class is not a damn commodity to be squandered by your sickly rich friends.
3373 2018-07-27 20:27:28 "We flagged our concerns that a lot of high flying US stocks had the chart patterns of "classic #bubbles"...In other words, the patterns had very little to do with fundamentals but were merely momentum plays." Today's Chart Point points out price action worth watching. #Markets
3374 2018-07-27 20:27:17 Fake news is truly taking a toll on various countries,and even, platforms like Facebook & Twitter has been losing billion of dollars in stocks, people being killed innocently worldwide.
3375 2018-07-27 20:26:53 So we go through another consolidation next week and one more rally for Dow Jones to make new highs into late August or early September, then we will see the October seasonality. At this juncture, the small caps and growth stocks look exhausted. $DJX $RUT $NDX $SPX
3376 2018-07-27 20:25:16 BTW I like these real-time tweets on fallen value stocks!
3377 2018-07-27 20:25:02 I set a new blood donation PR. 4:38 shatters my previous PR of 6:08.

3378 2018-07-27 20:24:53 Netflix stocks down since July 9th $66 per share because Rice and Obama’s has to be very painful...Twitter down nearly $9 per share Facebook $45 per share best advise walkaway

3381 2018-07-27 20:24:26 They will live to regret it. Twitter stocks fell today! How about those apples @jack? Better stop censoring conservatives! How are all those class action law suits against the company coming? Must be costing the company a lot of money.
3382 2018-07-27 20:24:20 Thanks! Followed! Dump Twitter Stocks RT!
3383 2018-07-27 20:24:12 Slow market this week mostly because of ER season, especially for large caps. However, we did finish strong. Expecting a massive continuation in $SSLJ just like $AWX. Enjoy your weekend #swingtrading #Pennystocks #stockmarket #stocks #daytrader #swingtrader
3384 2018-07-27 20:23:05 Could be start of Aug-Sept swoon.  Large WTIC short at $68 even.  It makes sense that stocks/WTIC can go down together. Hedging with SPX shorts once again but will be buying SPX all the way down for next ATH and higher push.  WTIC initial target 66 and eventually 59 for ICL.
3385 2018-07-27 20:23:05 Our damned legislators voted through concealed carry WITHOUT permitting requirements. I can stick a handgun in my purse just like lipstick. No one cares. Our legislators also refused to ban bump stocks because “handicapped persons may need a bump stock to more easily fire a gun.”
3386 2018-07-27 20:22:24 World stocks ex US higher: Europe +.4%; US -.7%. 4.1% GDP growth not enough to outweigh mixed earnings & more political dysfunction. Short-term investors have my sympathy. Long-term (3-5 years) ones should be fine. Important to have realistic expectations - single-digit returns
3387 2018-07-27 20:22:17 Yes that's very good, but they also need to get the CE mark removed on OTC markets. Not even Interactive Brokers will allow any of their account holders to buy this stock with the CE. I was just about to transfer my account to them when I found this out - specifically about $FRFS
3388 2018-07-27 20:22:08 Corporations Haven't Completely Stopped Buying Back Their Shares But they Have Slowed Considerably So My Take Is It's A Good Time To Take Some Profits And Pull Money Out Of The Market 10yr TBills Look Best To Weather The Coming Storm...I'd Closely Watch Energy Stocks...

3394 2018-07-27 20:20:28 Stocks took a hide increase. Woo hoo
3395 2018-07-27 20:19:38 Hey @Jack @MA thanks for the income boost, put'ing your stocks was a God send! Hope you like your island vacation @ taxpayer expense!

3402 2018-07-27 20:17:20 4.1% growth for a quarter... and all it cost us was our clean water & air through deregulation, a $1 trillion deficit increase through the corporate tax cuts, and a trade war that forced farmers to liquidate stocks before they lost out access to foreign markets they sell to.

3406 2018-07-27 20:16:13 I panicked when I got up this morning and heard the Stock Market had ravished some stocks. I was afraid I had lost $16 billion, but thankfully I didn't. That was a close call.
3407 2018-07-27 20:16:07 $FB and $LOGM two stocks that got hit wayyyyy harder than they should have mostly on self degradation. My theory is both recover strong by October. In a bull market where nobody can sit on their hands, they’re two of the only bargains to be had. #Finance #FinTech
3408 2018-07-27 20:16:07 We own less than $1.5 mil in oil stocks out of $817 mil we have as of yesterday. What percent is that? Round down it's ZERO.

I know you make great recommendations when to buy your suggested stocks, but do you make recommendations as to when to see these stocks?
3412 2018-07-27 20:14:46 Sugar high. Take a strong economy, add tax breaks for the ultra wealthy. They use the extra cash for stock buybacks which causes stocks to go up & pays them dividends.  Then they use the increase in the deficit that they created as an excuse to cut programs.

3424 2018-07-27 20:11:45 @reeyah_sa Hey reeyah_sah, I'm a full time FX trader too and loving every minute of it. I started trading first at age 18 with stocks. My teacher was a Dr. Alexander Elder (He's pretty famous) I then when from stocks to options, then finally FX. I trade using mainly price action!
3425 2018-07-27 20:11:38 Alibaba shares haven't moved at all vs Amazon. BABA remains down on China trade dispute but this is time to nibble at best stocks that are down. China is still the biggest growth engine of the world AND the middle class in China IS CONSTANTLY expanding- that growth is tremendous
3426 2018-07-27 20:11:29 We share the same life story lol, but was never in AWX. I've had the bulk of my capital tied up in the same handful of stocks over the last few years, and it's been a very poor strategy.

3432 2018-07-27 20:08:43  @realDonaldTrump has made @Twitter GOBS of money.  People like me only got on Twitter because of him during the last election. More are coming with the upcoming, life-changing elections—unless @jack loses us all because of the sensorship and games.  Stocks plummeting!

3470 2018-07-27 19:55:33 And aging population? I dont know. There's a lot of money in keeping the status quo, so it's interesting. No idea what will happen and really again, my call is to look at expectations and think if being overweight stocks is optimal for your situation looking at risk/reward

3479 2018-07-27 19:52:25 Yep, Democrats should have done something then. I don’t have a problem calling them out.  But if you care about gun reform, why aren’t you asking Republicans to do something....even something small such as banning bump stocks that both parties can agree on.

3488 2018-07-27 19:43:09 Twitter stocks are next to tank!
3489 2018-07-27 19:42:55 Another explanation could have to do with how the move happened. Earnings driven by a few stocks mostly, not systemic which is vol suppressing given 1) riding up high skew and 2) bottom up divergence as single stock vol goes down after earnings so implied correlation too high
3490 2018-07-27 19:41:51 They might be watching, but I doubt they care.. I'm leaning towards the belief a lot of them are paid off.
3491 2018-07-27 19:40:25 100 billion in stocks lost by deleting fake accounts. Capitalism.
3492 2018-07-27 19:40:22 What is momentarily pleasing is that there is good recording media to play back to the charlatans who convinced a gullible nation to slit their own throats.

3533 2018-07-27 19:21:32 Right, it does figure, just as all economists noted this tax cut was a terrible policy at the wrong time, because corporations were already at record profits and huge piles of cash, so they had nothing to do with their new debt funded tax cut but dump it into juicing the stocks.

3543 2018-07-27 19:18:24 It's pure speculation, there's not enough of them at that grade. Stocks are expected to return 5-7% and because there's so much risk you'd at least want triple to begin justifying that - which is shy of a quarter mill in 5 years.

3559 2018-07-27 19:10:49 and stocks drop today - how many times has the GDP gone up and stocks gone down? looks like somebody knows something...other than just Mueller

3583 2018-07-27 19:00:46 Facebook sucks and their stocks are falling like rocks in a lake straight to the bottom
3584 2018-07-27 18:59:39 What I was reading is they’re out of money. Stocks have dropped big time just today and continue to plunge. Theater chains are creating their own type of deal, just not quite as insane. Hopefully something comes along that works well

3586 2018-07-27 18:58:18 The $HMNY bears are simply trying to drop the price below $1.00 before the 10 day timeframe after the R/S.  THAT IS ALL!

3587 2018-07-27 18:57:47 Unfortunately @Twitter #stocks are sinking tremendously by 16%. Watch out #NASDAQ #investments not so good idea.
3588 2018-07-27 18:57:28 The #Fed was loud and clear about #QT in 2017. I and many other analysts said it was a pipe dream, they couldn't do it, it would crash stocks, send yields soaring. Lee Adler disagreed and was right. Now they talk of far higher rates. Lee says no chance. He has my vote.

3607 2018-07-27 18:52:24 Wow! That sure sucks! You must be in NY or CA! My home value has gone up $50k, our paychecks are noticeably better each check, our tax returns were a good bit better, stocks are up, and I can say Merry Christmas this year!!

3608 2018-07-27 18:50:37 Very true. I’m just tired of hearing the economy is great! Look at the numbers! It’s ridiculous. Most people living paycheck to paycheck don’t purchase stocks. So it’s a total misconception! Just typical talking points.

3611 2018-07-27 18:50:05 oh please, 18% when it comes to stocks is nothing, it will rise again. That's not even the lowest twitter was within a year, they went down to 16 usd and stayed there for a long time. Of course the stockholders will be scared when there are negative news.
3612 2018-07-27 18:50:00 I am really curious what will become new "placeholder" at #social #networks #stocks #market instead of former #Facebook. Most probably it will be absolutely new company and surely not as exactly comparable to what it is going to replace soon
3613 2018-07-27 18:49:59 The real question is how much is this company really worth.
3614 2018-07-27 18:49:55 That’s simply a false statement. For example, after the Las Vegas incident the NRA supported reviewing a ban of bump stocks. Apparently you and Eric Church were not aware of that.
3615 2018-07-27 18:49:04 I wish! Just averaging in. Business is fine, huge margin of safety. I'm good to wait and hope it falls so I can average lower. Note Peter Lynch: "most of my stocks didn't do well until their fifth, sixth year!"

3619 2018-07-27 18:47:14 Troy  -- you still have the same error in your text as when you tweeted this before. "Initial Claims tend to trend downwards before stocks top" should say trend UP.
3620 2018-07-27 18:47:12 I know too many ppl into stocks to not be invested 
3621 2018-07-27 18:46:51 I'll stick with the free-market approach: it only increases the tax-load if you don't constrain welfare payments.

[The middle- and upper-classes have their pensions heavily invested in stocks: maximising returns for them is - IMHO - a major social good]
3622 2018-07-27 18:46:28 HODL Gang, HODL Gang, HODL Gang, HODL Gang, HODL Gang, HODL Gang, HODL Gang. I don't even really buy stocks man.

3624 2018-07-27 18:45:35 My view: You can't extrapolate short positions of the stock market to cryptocurrencies. For one thing. If governments regulate it could potentially go to zero in a very short time-frame. Stocks don't have that risk.
3625 2018-07-27 18:45:29 Google Netflix Twitter Facebook stocks just getting fucking hammered today.
3626 2018-07-27 18:45:09 From what I read, they are Banning people from seeing your tweets, unless they think others should see them.
I suggest Twitter remember what happened to Facebook Stocks, lol
3627 2018-07-27 18:44:45 We've also got to get rid of those high capacity straw magazines. No straw bump-stocks, either.
3628 2018-07-27 18:44:10 That's a common mistake made.
Wages, if defined as money for prior labor (sweat or intellectual), should not be taxed.
Income, if defined as other people's wages, can be; interest, stocks (company shares, not increased production units), rents, etc, can be taxed without problems

3630 2018-07-27 18:43:46 Commodities and other widely traded stocks/assets are known to be manipulated yet still maintain their presence on the world's markets. #Bitcoin is very hard to manipulate, to the point where you need all of the world's computers to do so... Truly impossible.

3639 2018-07-27 18:39:02 Some stocks listed in India have a mcap <2000 cr,negligible debt , ambitious management and innovative products. I don't believe in holding stocks for 20-30 years but I firmly believe that these stocks will give 400-1000%. Look for these stocks to invest for 2020 mania.
3640 2018-07-27 18:38:20 And not surprisingly an aggressive Fed killed bonds and held stocks to a near nothing gain on 94. I fear we are on the same path. Beware Q3 and Q4 earnings slips while Fed keeps charging upward.

3645 2018-07-27 18:36:48 Most analysts have $ALGN as a hold or buy.  Is it down today because of the overall market or tech stocks, or something related to the company itself?
3646 2018-07-27 18:36:48 #Stocks,#Indexes Both SPX, NDX have completed low grade top signals. Moreover, completions FOLLOWED substantial decline.  The prior context for signals of major tops is dramatic price rise.  Holding longs for now.
3647 2018-07-27 18:36:30 bad time to invest in stocks
3648 2018-07-27 18:35:55 To my understanding not even all editors get paid. At least in our field some associate editors only get a dinner once a year for their services.

If I had known 10 years ago how academic publishing works I would have bought their stocks and made some money for myself as well.
3649 2018-07-27 18:35:54 The market is particularly great for those that actually own stocks. Unemployment they say is down do they take into account those not looking for a job? Like those on public assistance or those too drugged up to work? And the homeless? There are plenty! No ones helping them.

3682 2018-07-27 18:24:29 Do we know who is selling off the stocks of Facebook and Twitter? I'm curious if they have to access money because accounts are closed.
3683 2018-07-27 18:24:18 $FRFS 0.0585 lots of filings coming out!
3684 2018-07-27 18:24:04 why dont u lose some more money on stocks
3685 2018-07-27 18:23:41 Yup. PLURK, FEED, VINE... @Snap is heading down that road... even @Twitter isn’t looking good but who’s going to replace them? IG? Now I need all my weed stocks to pull their heads out of their bongs and make some money for me!!! Lol!!!
3686 2018-07-27 18:22:07 We should bring back the stocks for this and throw tomatoes at them. Tinned tomatoes.
3687 2018-07-27 18:22:00 Which he often reminds us of...and that he is fabulously wealthy...and he has a beach house...and he has made a ton of money gambling and with stocks..and of course, he is an attorney...guy must have a disjointed arm patting his own back
3688 2018-07-27 18:21:55 It’s amazing that people like @SarahPalinUSA and @kevinolearytv keep talking about how small businesses are doing so well like that has anything to do with the Average American. CEOs and Business owners keep that money just like these Big Corps are doing with BuyBack Stocks.

3692 2018-07-27 18:20:14 What about a person who owns stocks in predatory colleges regulating student payments to those colleges?
3693 2018-07-27 18:18:48 The best business advice I have ever heard is that don't play the penny stocks.
3694 2018-07-27 18:18:00 Volatility can be quite extreme in some markets - often associated with corrections in a trending market. Can cause gaps right thru your stops which will expose you to larger risk. That's one good reason to be cautious particularly around #stocks earnings.

3697 2018-07-27 18:16:39 It now makes sense why people are selling their #BF & #T stock.

3708 2018-07-27 18:12:06 SEP, metal detectors & photo ID badges r obviously good ideas.  Other good ideas r 2 ban assault-type rifles, bump stocks, high capacity mags & close the private sale/gun show loophole by requiring enhanced universal background checks.  Limiting the lethality is a good idea.

3716 2018-07-27 18:10:02 $FB got sold off this week and now $TWTR as if they are penny stocks after their pump, and not multi-billion dollar/mega-cap tech companies... That should give everybody pause and food for thought about the real state of the current market.

3722 2018-07-27 18:08:24 A couple ways. I use it to find stocks/mkts that are basing/consolidating. Also use it to help confirm a setup. If the chart has a pattern I'm looking for & the indicator shows it's squeezing (volatility contraction) then I like the odds for a break out. I set alerts to prompt me

3726 2018-07-27 18:06:10 @jeremycorbyn  Western nations should stop taxing labor, and tax only capital gains, stocks, dividends, etc. This way those that truly run things & own everything actually pay their fair share while the worker gets to keep what took blood, sweat, and tears to provide. #taxthe1%
3727 2018-07-27 18:06:02 I bet. 
I pay for access to a private options account that gives their plays and honestly they've cost me so much money, I swear they lose 80% of the time. What a waste. My own stocks and research have always done well- listening to others ends up being a dud.

3730 2018-07-27 18:04:51 Zero lower bound. Short term rates should’ve been -10% in 2009. Or, why bother doing VC investing when all asset prices are falling every month? Stay liquid and wait for stocks to bottom out.
3731 2018-07-27 18:04:46 There he goes again. Liking incorrect information. 100% institutions will put money into stocks cheaper than $5. Sure, theyd prefer higher share prices, but there's plenty of  companies under $5 with institutions involved. I want a company under $5 that's in the Russell 2000...

3738 2018-07-27 18:02:11 In places like the UK and US & Asia where stocks are traded in an open market, its regulated by the securities & exchange commission. One reason why companies hesitate to go public is because of the stringent rules to which they’d have to adhere

3751 2018-07-27 17:58:54 There is a reason that institutional investors, pension plans, and mutual funds do not invest in stocks under $5 and that brokers won't let you trade them on margin. Why focus on that? These companies don't have the fundamentals or history to justify calling them value stocks.

Want to know why Twitter stocks have dropped?
~ Jeremy Owens says:  "Twitter just did away with a bunch of fake accounts."  

Isn't this so good to know ~ that deleting accounts - loses money out of their pockets?  Huh  *head still spinning*
3764 2018-07-27 17:53:57 Probably good to couple this question with "How many randomly-selected baskets of 15 stocks would have seen their portfolio value cut by 50% or more yet never recovered..."
3765 2018-07-27 17:53:52 damn penny stocks cool but i’m ready for the real league lol
3766 2018-07-27 17:53:46 I figured this would happen, People invested too much into tech companies while real jobs get no money at all. Amazon, Apple and a few others are seeing big dips.
But honestly the buyers might save them, their stocks are guaranteed to exist on the market for a while.
3767 2018-07-27 17:53:03 Now we are watching bubbles burst. I’ve pulled all our money out of volatile stocks and into bonds. I’m ok with losing out on any interest, so I can hang onto most of the principle. I’m glad we’ve paid off our mortgage, because that bubble is going to burst, too.

3774 2018-07-27 17:51:33 Bank of America ML research note, the so-called FAANG stocks -Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google - were single0handedly responsible for the S&P 500 being positive through the first half of 2018. Without them, the index’s first half performance would have been -0.73%.
3775 2018-07-27 17:51:32 No, it's from ppl jumping ship. Selling their stocks. 

The final nail on the coffin would be if our President moved to Gab.

3788 2018-07-27 17:47:20 It's mathematics, dude. You take what money someone has and calculate how much money that person would have gained by investing it into certain stocks etc. It's pretty simple to calculate something like that.

3812 2018-07-27 17:38:05 It's more than feeling.  When stocks go up, people have money to spend.  When stocks go down, they don't.

3819 2018-07-27 17:35:04 That's because Facebook had the single biggest loss of market capitalization in history yesterday.  In turn, investors probably sent sell orders to dump tech heavy mutual funds.  These funds probably had some of the Dow 30 stocks in their portfolio, creating a ripple effect

3835 2018-07-27 17:31:03 yes why not,  commodity stocks are bought at high PEs and sold at low PEs,  at the bottom they have low prices but high PEs,  at the height of the cycle they have low PEs but high prices,  this logic cant be applied to them
3836 2018-07-27 17:30:54 Thus far it seems that stocks are calling all the fake "our economy is the greatest ever" news. Even bond market propping up is failing to boost stocks.

3840 2018-07-27 17:30:08 Yes that’s how it works in an open market where stocks are traded. The academic aspect also needs to be included when talking about scenarios like these. To understand how such a loss can be incurred by a company.
3841 2018-07-27 17:29:45 So much for the GREAT economy. Stocks are way down. Just wondering though, @realDonaldTrump: is this one of those things that isn’t really happening?

3843 2018-07-27 17:29:24 well if 2000 blowup/blowoff occurs stuff will get a lot cheaper than that...  I don't see this period as a 1999 Bubble, more like the Spring 2014 IMO... as it's a narrowly focused Bubble.  1999 almost everything save for $BRKA and Energy stocks were Mega overvalued

3861 2018-07-27 17:23:06 Index gaps tend to fill (almost always). Individual stocks are far less liable, often having 'breakaway gaps', especially on earnings.

3896 2018-07-27 17:12:12 The 1 percenters are dictating the rise & fall of these stocks. It seems that lately when stocks should fall due to trade skirmishes they rise. When twitter cleans up fake accounts the stocks fall sharply.

Stocks are like gold -- the value can go up and down. Stocks are highly susceptible to value PERCEPTION, and often dip low suddenly or raise high suddenly.

These sudden lows/highs are not terribly important.

3933 2018-07-27 17:00:41 I never had everything in one name, but 2-4 names, yes.  I've seen (non penny) stocks gap down 80%... that's close enough to 100%! Future Healthcare comes to mind. Stock was relatively high priced and close to setting up... then, wham!!
3934 2018-07-27 17:00:37 Sure.

But it is showing jn the stocks, what people think of this blatant manipulation.
3935 2018-07-27 17:00:12 Stock drop: $HMNY and 46 other stocks drop. The Common Wealth is investigating! Reach out for more info. TheCommonWealth.mail@gmail.com #StockDrop #HMNY
3936 2018-07-27 17:00:12 That sounds fun but i have no idea about those and I'm sure that if i started buying stocks I'd just lose all my money lol
3937 2018-07-27 17:00:11 Bring back the stocks for all ERG members!
3938 2018-07-27 16:59:40 Where they all really that inept?  Really?

I don't think so.  I think we are seeing the beginning of what was previously Deep State funding being returned to the American people.  

It's no coincidence that so many tech stocks are down.  Biggly.  

Winning!

3941 2018-07-27 16:58:46 $AMZN now up single digits only. Quick, someone get Powell on the phone and order up QE4. Or better yet, close the #stockmarket! On the + side, maybe someone on TV will talk about the 9,373 OTHER stocks we grade at #WeissRatings rather than only $FB $AMZN $AAPL $NFLX & $GOOGL
3942 2018-07-27 16:58:31 #askhalftime 

Can you show a graphic comparing total shares outstanding for the FAANG stocks? I think it is fascinating how few shares Amazon has outstanding relative to the others.
3943 2018-07-27 16:58:23 best #GDP print in 4 years and stocks are DOWN 

what do you expect when stocks kept going up  for 8 years under Obama. The man never got us a single year of 3%. #FridayFeeIing #QE #ZIRP #CheapMoneyPolicies $DJI $NDX $SPX
3944 2018-07-27 16:57:55 Bought some $CCXI $APTO $COLL today
3945 2018-07-27 16:57:42 Thanks! The thing that gets me is I only have TM stocks on my watchlist. If I had puts on the garbage I used to trade I’d be making a killing! 
3946 2018-07-27 16:57:36 Wall Street dips as Intel drags tech stocks lower: U.S. stocks fell on Friday as technology shares were dragged lower by disappointing results from Intel and Twitter, although a jump in Amazon after strong earnings helped curb losses.
3947 2018-07-27 16:57:03 @dxuknw now this here is another such scenario where investors react to a decision made by twitter which in turn affects the share price of the stocks which are traded on the stock exchange. It’s actually a drop in share price.
3948 2018-07-27 16:56:51 Why is Apple the Rodney Dangerfeld of stocks?
3949 2018-07-27 16:56:23 I assume by rapidly you mean machine guns. By legal definition a machine gun fires more than one round per trigger pull. Bump stocks are...
3950 2018-07-27 16:56:09 @AskRobinhood App isn't loading options or stocks when opened. Also, can't log into the website, any idea what is going on?
3951 2018-07-27 16:55:36 Just look at all the unfinished game released on steam. They finished the game cause they care about customers they could have easily disapeared and kept the money
3952 2018-07-27 16:55:20 Stocks: r-star reappraisal
3953 2018-07-27 16:55:05 and they are smart to axe it before riding it into the grave... ford cutting their whole lineup minus the mustang and the focus crossover... your point... no ones buying american cars gm stocks barely break 45$ a share...
3954 2018-07-27 16:54:58 First $FB, then $TWTR -- and even $AMZN - the writing is on the wall, #tech is going to have a pullback.  And since a handful of tech #stocks have lifted the market, it will drag the #market down in the short term.  Fully valued = downside #risk !!
3955 2018-07-27 16:54:49 2014 was coming off of bottom, so it would have been horrifying had GDP NOT had a huge bounce. Clearly you don't understand stocks or financial markets, but big swings upward are normal off of bottoms. Takes effort/skill to get 4% when the market is already roaring. Research it
3956 2018-07-27 16:54:20 Both FB and Twitter stocks have crashed about 20% in the last 2 days. Good.
3957 2018-07-27 16:54:15 $SPY BLOCK TRADE [12:54:14] @ $281.22, 875,000 shares. $ES_F $SPX $SPXL $SPXS $SPXU $UPRO #stocks #investing #trading
3958 2018-07-27 16:53:58 so stronger support is about 5 % lower.  So many stocks down more than that today.
3959 2018-07-27 16:53:53 Terrible weak for Social media stocks. FB took a huge loss and now twitter down 18%.
3960 2018-07-27 16:53:50 The fact that corporations have mainly used their tax savings to buy back and inflate their stocks (and I’m sure to raise exec pay) proves it was never about “competitiveness.” Little in the way of investment or hiring or raises. A giveaway on taxpayer dime.
3961 2018-07-27 16:53:32 My TOP call paying big!  posted on Twitter!!!  No services - no hype - no bullshit!  I am not a buyer of anything tech....this tape is tricky as hell...dont let price guide you....stocks most expensive in history by a mile

3963 2018-07-27 16:52:47 Is it a coincidence that Facebook had a sudden change of heart the day after their stocks plummeted losing them $120 billion in a matter of hours?
3964 2018-07-27 16:52:35 U R such a liar. My stocks TANKED again! Lost 34% of original value, not including gains-that's what I PAID 4 them vs what they r now. Also have no insurance A/O Monday- U Boast Lie & Slander NO Thoughts/Prayers for FIRE VICTIMS out WEST? #SAD #MAGAMyButt

3966 2018-07-27 16:52:25 Wow. Add Twitter to the list of stocks with HUGE decreases in values lately.
3967 2018-07-27 16:51:38 I got you. But then let's see where Twitter will be by the end of this year. As well as other stocks.
3968 2018-07-27 16:51:36 Looking at the faces on @PowerLunch today looks like the #FANG stocks broke off a tooth at the base.... $FB $GOOG
3969 2018-07-27 16:51:33 Stocks are hard
3970 2018-07-27 16:51:32 Trend developing... all mega-cap tech stocks not named $AMZN take ~20% haircuts on missed guidance. Looking at you $TSLA....
3971 2018-07-27 16:51:19 I’ve been mostly cash since last week taking sniper trades only. I need to start keeping a haircut list for days like this. So many overbought stocks crashing where short dated puts can triple. Thanks @Scot1andT for the SQ call. Up 200% so far on $70 puts expiring today.
3972 2018-07-27 16:51:06 Home Depot’s stocks have been in the slumps for 2 weeks
3973 2018-07-27 16:50:45 Oh yes!!! OMG I’m sitting here in my living room literally DYING!! DYING I say. The tax cut is armageddon, dying from ISIS being decimated, dying from Iran being crippled again, dying from my stocks going thru the roof, dying from that damn exploding GDP!!What will I do??

3975 2018-07-27 16:50:15 I just read a tweet that it's junk action everywhere, incl 'big' stocks.

Are you serious? It's earnings season, plus news, plus IPOs, plus Elon tweets... This is incredible action.

If you can't trade this, then maybe 'trading' isn't in your future.

3978 2018-07-27 16:49:16 Stocks getting hammered after a great week. Economy is good earnings pretty good. Sell for the weekend, who knows. Seems short sighted with progress on trade. Many more earnings reports next week.
3979 2018-07-27 16:49:00 Lol... and history has proven them right! How sad that because you disagree with his opinion on bump stocks that turns into this. Play on @ericchurch
3980 2018-07-27 16:48:56 Hi there. The purpose of this whole activity is like this - Dimesh puts up a list of stocks which can be observed for trading alongwith the reasons on his telegram. We followers tell him if we select a stock from it. He then asks us if we took live trade and we update him (1)
3981 2018-07-27 16:48:44 yea, this is worse than some of the other pull backs we have had, as the FANG stocks are now showing distribution and poor reactions on earnings.  If distribution picks up in those names, everythig else gets hit.
3982 2018-07-27 16:48:20 Yeah I’m sure some penny stocks no one has ever heard of have fallen 99% in a day.
3983 2018-07-27 16:47:50 We publish company info, financials, the consensus estimates that brokers provide, news, and their avg broker rating on over 8,000 stocks. But we only assign a Zack Rank to approx. 4,200.
3984 2018-07-27 16:47:41 Unboxers sneezed lol -- what a soak so far if they take this back up and all the boxes are off oh geez. What a fun name it's like back in the APS (Awesome Penny Stocks) days. Literally.
3985 2018-07-27 16:47:35 On economic matters, ordinary conservatives prefer quantity to quality, tangible things to intangible things, the physical to the abstract, manufacturing over services, exports to imports, gold over cash, cash over checking accounts, bonds over stocks etc.

3988 2018-07-27 16:46:58 Yeah - let me correct that statement for you: if you don’t own lots of stocks, you won’t benefit from the Trump economy.
3989 2018-07-27 16:46:28 The top five stocks lower at noon today are $TWRR, $JPNR, $EW, $INTC, and $WDC.
3990 2018-07-27 16:45:52 The top five most active stocks at noon today are $AMD, $TWTR, $INTC, $FB, and $T.
3991 2018-07-27 16:45:51 Restored the Stocks app on my iPhone just so I could watch this $HMNY @MoviePass madness go down today. Nearly back to where they were after a 1/250 reverse split 2 days ago! Crazy stuff. 

If you own stock in HMNY, I’m sorry.
3992 2018-07-27 16:45:50 Prefer to look at patterns rather than 1-offs.  Lets see if they are still following this behaviour 6-months from now when the spotlight may not be on them as much (and/or their stocks go up again.)
3993 2018-07-27 16:45:43 Richest 10% own 80+% of stocks. Marxist coffee klatches? Really? Get a real education after deVos is enprisoned
3994 2018-07-27 16:45:39 @Stephanie_Link @cnbc @ReformedBroker I've been a value investor since the Mesozoic era; but sometimes I feel value stocks are like the A+ student that sits in the front row of class that everyone totally despises....
3995 2018-07-27 16:45:10 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $EXPE, $LRCX, $NOV, $JEF, and $ZBH.
3996 2018-07-27 16:44:58 $GST trying to get that 100% move
3997 2018-07-27 16:44:50 In 1-3 months these companies won't be this cheap, so why would it be better when they are more expensive? Are you investing or trading, because if you're value investing like Buffett, here's the dip. Those ETFS primarily track Canadian stocks and are also actively managed.
3998 2018-07-27 16:44:35 I was going to sell my Twitter stocks earlier this week!
3999 2018-07-27 16:44:27 No, not a parrot.  I just think there’s no reason for bump stocks to be legal. And I don’t consider it unreasonable to run a background check prior to buying a gun.

4002 2018-07-27 16:43:44 Tried to get one in a Boots branch that stocks Smashbox but was looked up and down like I'd crawled out from the gutter and told they were out of stock as if I'd personally caused them to run out, left feeling really embarrassed to have asked. :( so thanks for that

4029 2018-07-27 16:34:42 those frightened sheep have to sell those stocks (or in most cases 401 K being liquidated) so they can live in their homes and eat.
4030 2018-07-27 16:34:38 So, Twitter is trying to clean up it’s dirty laundry suspending many many many accounts!.!.
What’s that about?

I suspect Twitter don’t want to get caught like Facebook stocks dropping rapidly

4032 2018-07-27 16:34:00 #askhalftime @HalftimeReport Said you like @JD_Corporate on occasions but would really appreciate your opinion on HUYA SOGO IQ as 1/2 FAANG stocks seem out of steam. Should we look to these China plays for Growth especially since we missed the Massive Runs Up in FAANG stocks?
4033 2018-07-27 16:33:55 Thanks! My discussion of Netflix and Facebook were part of the convo about FAANG, which are the high-flying/heavy-moving stocks. As far as race to $1T, of course many companies are in, including Google & Microsoft, but closest competition is Apple vs Amazon, which I highlighted.
4034 2018-07-27 16:33:46 The opinions about "BREADTH" are widely different from those that own stocks and those that don't.

4037 2018-07-27 16:33:05 I really need to start looking into stocks or something or mutual funds. Fell like my savings is kinda doing nothing is its savings account with what sub .2% interest?  Maybe a money market account, but if im going to tie stuff up why not go for stocks and get a chance return.

4041 2018-07-27 16:32:16 IT'S NOT MY FAULT, IT'S WHAT MY WORK STOCKS
4042 2018-07-27 16:31:33 Stocks are part of the GDP- Since the tax freeloaders have been on a buy back binge with their stocks , of course the GDP went up  - It doesn't mean anything to the rest of us though. Wait till that correction in the market hits #fakerecovery
4043 2018-07-27 16:31:03 If you are referring to how the stocks are doing , they are all red , big losses especially to the Nasdaq. Your GDP is nothing.
4044 2018-07-27 16:30:41 The stocks I’m willing to bet big on are $FB & $SPOT just because I believe Spotify is the Netflix of music and it will eventually hit $300+/share like Netflix and Facebook for obvious reasons. I hope I’m retweeting this tweet in a couple of years with a smile rather than 
4045 2018-07-27 16:30:22 Popular brokers used for trading stocks, forex, commodities etc are expanding their portfolios offering more cryptocurrencies for their users.
Early this year we had Plus 500 list a new category for crypto although at the time only Bitcoin was listed
4046 2018-07-27 16:30:20 I am glad @facebook stocks sank... Facebook is pro-Teump, Pro-fascism and pro-racism platform that worked with the Russians to help @realDonaldTrump campaign. I urge on everyone to boycott Facebook.
4047 2018-07-27 16:30:20 Results matter.  Media focusing on their storylines while minority jobs , GDP , trade deficit trending , stocks .  Why don’t these important facts get more coverage than rumors, kneeling, marches? Oh yeah... not their president, not their news.

4050 2018-07-27 16:29:35 1. Agree the architect still rules (for now) but what I'm pointing to is a paradigm shift in the way markets operate.  Floor specialists were in charge of stocks through the prices they made and the flows they controlled.  Similarly, large pool operators were able to manipulate
4051 2018-07-27 16:28:21 Manage your stocks, or they'll manage you. #stocks
4052 2018-07-27 16:27:56 So true. Years ago. took some HUGE hits. Back in the early 2000's.   Said, "enough of this!"   Manage our stocks, as you know.
4053 2018-07-27 16:27:54 Remember that day all those tech stocks hit new 52 week highs then closed lower?
4054 2018-07-27 16:27:46 Tell me why stocks r dropping?
4055 2018-07-27 16:27:40 .
It's Twitter's turn, now!  Could this be the end of the model?  The apex has been reached, social media is in regression, will level off, relegated to mundane vanilla stocks that just lie there, or lose more!

They burned us users by selling data, now lose that revenue stream!
4056 2018-07-27 16:27:30 AWX? BSPM? Those were the Pig Players stocks du jour....
4057 2018-07-27 16:27:15 Yes corporations are doing great! Getting massive tax breaks and using that money to buyback stocks from desperate cash strapped workers and artificially inflating their stock prices. Stock markets look good, but workers arent getting fair wages. Massive wealth disparity! #Shame
4058 2018-07-27 16:27:00 My biggest winners this year - $GDS $AAXN $QDEL $GPRK. Not exactly household names. One of my largest milestones was detaching from the need to be involved in hot stocks in the news.

4061 2018-07-27 16:24:47 Though to be fair, maybe trump is talking about a turnaround , downwards, in stocks...
4062 2018-07-27 16:24:25 @HalftimeReport 4 or 5 stocks does not an entire tech sector make
4063 2018-07-27 16:23:20 @George101 you keep saying that but stocks go up, down, or sideways. Just trade accordingly. Now sit down somewhere and let us Bulls be..lol
4064 2018-07-27 16:23:17 what I love about the worker who stocks the men’s on my floor is that even tho you’re coming in to destroy his domain he gives you this reassuring look like “go ahead, man. it’s ok.” 10/10
4065 2018-07-27 16:23:11 A lot of companies get employees to buy stock.

So when the market is good? They stand around congratulate themselves on how good their retirement portfolio looks.

Meanwhile their contract labor can't afford stocks, or 401k or healthcare. 
It's infuriating.
4066 2018-07-27 16:23:07 FOX, you doing the Rupert Murdoch propaganda lines pretending that you are clueless 2real reason Facebook & Twitter stocks are in a tizzy just makes you look stupid.  And also your failure to report on SuperValu & Amazon connection just makes you look stupid.

4068 2018-07-27 16:22:50 Twitter loses 1 million users and stocks tumble...who’s to blame? Fake accounts and bots peddling porn, the racist Alt Right or hysterical SJW mob? All ruin this medium for everyone else
4069 2018-07-27 16:22:46 Beyond pissed that it's necessary to do this, but thank you @BootstrapCook for reminding me to look up what local foodbank needs, take 6yo and do a supermarket sweep to help keep stocks up over the summer hols
4070 2018-07-27 16:22:20 It was supposed to be a friendly CB, but then I went in, took 7 stocks for MVP then this dude talked shit all the way when he barely broke even
4071 2018-07-27 16:22:11 baffles me as well had an argument with a trader today why gold stocks are more valuable then $LOV
4072 2018-07-27 16:22:00 I got stocks on bitcoin I ain’t took or sold yet but I got it free it was like a dollar that turned to 10 lbs I was shook
4073 2018-07-27 16:21:44 Had Facebook stocks. 
4074 2018-07-27 16:21:37 #LoveTwitter Stocks have nothing to do with the actual Twitter platform, people often go between platforms and for different reasons. Twitter is still #HotFire 
4075 2018-07-27 16:21:33 I go back onto Facebook and their stocks drop 19%. Sorry Mark Zuckerberg. I owe you £.

#Facebookstock
4076 2018-07-27 16:20:42 @HalftimeReport you permabulls should be ashamed of yourselves - can you actually hear yourselves speaking about these stocks and their heinous forward PE multiples! I hope you get a lesson in moderation
4077 2018-07-27 16:20:28 Ever have so many stocks you wanted to buy, but then had that little problem of.....Where’s this money coming from? #money #cash #moolah
4078 2018-07-27 16:20:22 (Copy paste). All gol loves killing immigrants and school shootings with ample fire power and bump stocks
4079 2018-07-27 16:20:21 That facebook fella lost 17billion dollars, shares and stocks can make you loose your head
4080 2018-07-27 16:20:10 stocks will wipe out 1 year's worth of gains and portfolio managers will wipe out 5 years worth
4081 2018-07-27 16:19:28  its okay ... their stocks in my heart keep going up!
4082 2018-07-27 16:19:20 I used to think that stocks moved based on absolute revenue / growth %

In reality, most move on expectations

If you get straight As your entire life and all the sudden get an A-, people are disappointed

If you get straight Fs and get a D+, people are ecstatic

4084 2018-07-27 16:18:48 There stocks dropped today btw
4085 2018-07-27 16:18:47 Well-supplied people don't buy petty stocks. Why? Because they are too risky
4086 2018-07-27 16:18:34 Yes, yes it will because his actions will have caused it. His tax plan has artificially inflated stock prices because most of the savings were given to large corporations who then bought back their own stocks at record pace
4087 2018-07-27 16:17:53 Twitter stocks not doing so good. I wonder why.
4088 2018-07-27 16:16:56 Tuskys supermarket  stocks household products, electronic equipments and furniture among other products.

4089 2018-07-27 16:16:25 NB You might not be part of the academic audience at all. Researchers for investment companies routinely do that level of microscopic analysis prior to large acquisitions of stocks. Does it work? Will it be approved? Do the competitors do it better. Disclosure aids that process.
4090 2018-07-27 16:15:57 Duh, CBS stocks are going to drop, at least today. Some simply don't want to be attached to what they see as a toxic asset. But the #1 reason? Uncertainty.
4091 2018-07-27 16:15:40 My mom texted me she’s at some thing about expanding pa’s stand your ground law. I told her to ask the NRA rep why he hates bump stocks, I’m a bad son
4092 2018-07-27 16:15:13 Waiting for Facebook stocks to crash some more, so that I can buy a couple because best believe... it will be going up again!
4093 2018-07-27 16:14:56 I also wonder who creates these messes, than play’s stocks to enrich himself and the spawn
4094 2018-07-27 16:14:50 Hey, sponsers......
I do not buy merchandise, trade stocks, buy insurance or eat at restaurants based on your ads on twitter. 
Your ad means nothing to me & does NOT influence my buying habits.
4095 2018-07-27 16:14:16 FACEBOOK  IS COLLAPSING 
TWITTER & CBS  STOCKS ARE GOING DOWN.

Do not mess with God's ANOINTED AND APPOINTED!
4096 2018-07-27 16:13:54 Why not...could become a whole new "thing". Eg @AdamSandler covering ecommerce, @TheRock covering biotech ipo's, @JaredLeto talking with fans about finance stocks.
Good on @ElizabethBanks for wanting to do something different and good on @StateStreet for thinking outside the box.
4097 2018-07-27 16:13:29 Find someone who looks at you the way Elizabeth Banks looks at mid-cap stocks
4098 2018-07-27 16:13:19 Which stocks ? Some Name
4099 2018-07-27 16:12:55 we had this competition thing in my 7th grade geography class where we had pretend stocks and by the end of the year, my team and I made the most profit and all I gotta say is

Yo Mr. Williams, still waiting for the pizza and chicken wings you promised us 
4100 2018-07-27 16:12:52 @nytimes   You stocks going south.  Couldnt happen to a nicer company. No really

4102 2018-07-27 16:12:23 The stock market is  after Trump's GDP announcement. Few stocks are up. It looks like people are buying new luggage from Amazon, booking a trip on Booking and stopping at Starbucks on their way out of town. 

Where would you go to get away from Trump?
4103 2018-07-27 16:12:14 Yikes. How many heavy weight stocks are there left in the market.
4104 2018-07-27 16:11:29 Honestly, the E-trade "I'm 85 and I wanna go home" ad tops them all.  Implies that if you don't start trading stocks on E-trade, you are going to be 85 years old and still being forced to work as a UPS deliveryman, fireman, lifeguard, or DJ.
4105 2018-07-27 16:10:48 Stockpiling and corporate stock buybacks are the only thing keeping the market from a crash. You know it is coming. Fortunately, most Americans have less than $400 in their bank account and zero stocks, so it won't actually hit the poor, beyond whatever blame the GOP places.
4106 2018-07-27 16:10:07 Many stocks are negative today while many cryptos are very positive today 
4107 2018-07-27 16:10:01 Damn thats awesome. My walmart never stocks anything good. And 95% the boxes are destroyed
4108 2018-07-27 16:09:41 Twatter stocks are declining on lower user base. Hmmmm I wonder if #Shadowbanning has anything to do with that #Twiiterstocks It’s a real beard scratcher question isn’t it?
4109 2018-07-27 16:09:41 GM, Ford,  stocks all down
4110 2018-07-27 16:09:31 Did you sell any stocks @KimDotcom  ? Hope you are well.

4115 2018-07-27 16:06:24 $qqq up 15% already on Aug $QQQ puts. With $FB & $NFLX killing sentiment I think tech is exhausted & 2Q GDP is causing a reset as we head into seasonally weak Aug/Sep. I *think* the backdrop is still very positive for stocks, but the last catalyst failed save over extended rally
4116 2018-07-27 16:06:23 My tweets on stocks 20x to 40x as many impressions as my town square political tweets. @Jack has tuned the algo just the way he wants. Censoring conservative anto #Progressive speech. Gotta end it @mattgaetz Lift #ShaddowBan or shut it down
4117 2018-07-27 16:06:18 Could we not bring back the stocks just for him? Bean bags (small) only? Would do wonders for town centre footfall....
4118 2018-07-27 16:06:06 What in the world that my superior said it to me?...

why? is it bad that I used my vl and this is my fault that the stocks in my area are not yet refilled? what kind of thinking is that? HUH?!

FYI! I AM NOT A ROBOT!. I AM A HUMAN THAT NEEDS REST AND TIME FOR MYSELF!..

4119 2018-07-27 16:05:29 Mark Zuckerberg pulled $2 million of his own stocks before the plummeting, what did he know?
4120 2018-07-27 16:05:22 Because stocks = 150% of GDP and are a major contributor to Federal Tax Receipts. Without a higher stock market, US budget deficit explodes, raising questions about US solvency. If the dollar falls, so what? Inflates away the debt and boosts Corp earnings in nominal terms.
4121 2018-07-27 16:05:05 When I was under Scottrade , I was charged a $20 fee for a listed stock becoming an OTCBB stock . Funeral fees for dying stocks ? ... lol .

4127 2018-07-27 16:02:44 I pick 4-6 stocks then narrow it to 1-2 at open, or sometimes I just pick 4-6 and see which ones rip to where I want to short then that's how I determine it's my main one.

4132 2018-07-27 16:01:31 When i get back to work coming from vl and rd and notice in the pharmacy area, there's a lot of stock and it is in a clutter state. I said to my superior

"why is it that the stocks here are not yet refilled in their area?"

My superior said to me...

"because you used your vl!."
4133 2018-07-27 16:01:31 thought it was a good quarter, this is happening to a lot of stocks. Hard to know what to do.
4134 2018-07-27 16:01:29 Americans don't give a fuck about the stock market, because it isn't the economy. It's the economy for people like you, Bill, who put all your money into it, but a vast majority of people don't invest in stocks
4135 2018-07-27 16:01:00 I love me some penny stocks and @RobinhoodApp is the best app to help me with this obsession. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.
4136 2018-07-27 16:00:59 you understand that if you by 1 share of penny stocks youre an investor right?
4137 2018-07-27 16:00:53 Taking some off the sidelines today and putting it to work in the market! #stocks
4138 2018-07-27 16:00:51 That just means it's not a shower of dung like #UKOG with huge volume (of muppets) buying into all the BS.
The higher volume stocks on AIM tend to be the biggest load of BS that you should avoid at all cost.
4139 2018-07-27 16:00:28 And I read an article from a guy who said the market will keep rising because the majority of people are bearish and that majority are always wrong about markets.  I believe the source was Bloomberg.  I don't agree cuz it seems there is an insatiable appetite for stocks.  BTFD
4140 2018-07-27 16:00:15 It can happen. Stocks traded & investors who have bought it, both are sensitive to how the companies work, anything that is positive or negative can affect the value of the share price. It shows that the investors are highly uncertain thus move to sell their shares
4141 2018-07-27 15:59:55 How do you feel about midcap stocks now?
4142 2018-07-27 15:59:37 Insider trading in Facebook sell off? Taking down Mark Zuckerberg? Who will take over if he is gone? Something smells of dirty socks, I mean stocks.

4144 2018-07-27 15:59:17 @UBS: We are neutral on the global tech sector, and  maintain an equal weight within our global tactical asset allocations.  Against a backdrop of elevated trade and regulatory risks, we believe  the software industry will continue to prove more resilient than  internet stocks.
4145 2018-07-27 15:59:09 Yes with the promise of higher wages and reinvestment back into the economy. When they buy back stocks and wages stay stagnant those practices slow growth giving the impression of a rising economy and their quarters reflect different # from ours that is why economists are waiting
4146 2018-07-27 15:58:54 ¡Buen día a todos! menos a los que tienen acciones de Twitter                               #stocks #StocksToWatch #Bolsa #WallStreet #trading #TWTR
4147 2018-07-27 15:56:57 Now only up 1.81%, & since they dropped 3% yesterday, they're cheaper than they were Wed despite good report. Being pulled down by other tech stocks like FB & Twitter which they're completely different than. Trump hasn't even tweeted an anti-Trust tweet on them in last few days
4148 2018-07-27 15:56:24 Oh my. *Stocks up on cold iron mousetraps*
4149 2018-07-27 15:56:04 Funny how the people who ask for a discount are the same people buying high and selling low. Do yourself a favor and buy stocks low, there’s your discount
4150 2018-07-27 15:55:47 man their stock is down to like $3 and change. Good things stocks don't have surge pricing. Lol
4151 2018-07-27 15:55:23 The overall weakness in CRISPR stocks is a little unnerving. I keep wondering if there is some sort of delay/hold not made public yet. Or if this is just a good ol’ fashion slap down. $EDIT $NTLA $CRSPR

4154 2018-07-27 15:55:01 It’s possible & not surprising at all. This has happened to many a companies whose stocks are traded. Facebook comes under the radar much more often than the rest for its notoriety I suppose.
4155 2018-07-27 15:54:47 Stocks that were sold the most during sell programs executed by program trading firms on Thursday July 26, 2018: T, MCD, BLK, RTN, BK, NFLX, HAL, CVS, TSLA, HD.
4156 2018-07-27 15:54:33 Country divided & falling apart! My little stocks lost $20 per share since January
4157 2018-07-27 15:53:49 no its just math
inheritance tax is 20-25% but if done thru a family office its 10-15%
if the inheritance is stocks or assets, then its taxed based on asset type however since PM is technically logistics then the tax rate is negotiable
4158 2018-07-27 15:52:21 Facebook's stocks fell largely due to narrowly missed projections. Their future is not "uncertain" - they'll be just fine. Twitter has been tanking for 3+ years but user engagement remains stable. This article is blatantly hyperbolic and sensationalist.
4159 2018-07-27 15:52:16 I would love to read that article. Does it read like because the higher returns on stocks have lead to people putting off paying lower rate loans? That would be a long term problem and terrible idea. Need that Dave Ramsey advice
4160 2018-07-27 15:52:13 $TWTR Tech stocks are behaving like cryptos now, double-digit percentage ups and downs.
4161 2018-07-27 15:52:02 I know that. What I’m saying is where do you draw the line? Some people draw the line at bump stocks...where do you draw the line?
4162 2018-07-27 15:51:35 Funny when @Twitter fails to stop bullies with monosyllabic last names names containing the vowel "u," it promptly loses a million users and the stock drops. Watch for other stocks to drop, like $TSLA...
4163 2018-07-27 15:51:17 There are way more conservatives and ex DEMS that buy things have STOCKS ECT
These people are so stupid look at your market before being immortal

That's according to models from forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers, which estimates that a Trump victory would cause stocks to head south dramatically...”

4168 2018-07-27 15:50:18 I’m just tired of him toting the economy when I look around (I understand stocks are doing good)?but everything else I see is just costing more money.

4171 2018-07-27 15:49:11 You r a financial illiterate. Believe whatever u want to believe. Meantime, job growth is at record highs, consumer sentiment is at historic levels, GDP is surging & corporate earnings r on the rise. (Yes, I want biz to make more money b/c that means more jobs & higher stocks.)

4173 2018-07-27 15:48:07 A lot of the MAGAs are watching the price of the agriculture goods they produce drop 20%/bushel.   Maybe next spring they'll plant stocks and yachts instead.
4174 2018-07-27 15:47:08 In Feb 2018, the NASDAQ did not have the same relative correction as the DIJA.

The Facebook hit was a major signal.

The #GOPTaxScam has been inflating stocks, and when the bubbles burst, the GOP will blame it on the Dems.
4175 2018-07-27 15:47:00 He can't afford not, hope twitter stocks go down bigtime
4176 2018-07-27 15:46:34 You're right! Market Cap often reveals a lot about a stocks long-term upside potential. 
4177 2018-07-27 15:46:26 The guys who bought stocks from pets DOT com thought they were geniuses. 

The guys who bought Bitcoin think they are geniuses.

We shall see what happens in the future. As it stands, BTC is not exactly the most promising thing out there.
4178 2018-07-27 15:46:22 Some Investors buy a stk on a thesis start monitoring stocks daily,.it takes years for a theme to play out. Patience & Conviction is the key
4179 2018-07-27 15:46:11 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your fibromyalgia
4180 2018-07-27 15:46:07 Want to win in the stock market? Stop looking at it like a beauty contest. Fortunes are made in the market when stocks look very ugly. When everyone runs away, the intelligent investor buys big. And then a wonderful thing happens. Those ugly ducklings turn into beautiful swans!
4181 2018-07-27 15:46:05 Thanks to the short-seller bs I was able to buy your stocks cheaper. I believe in Tesla (The Energy Storage company)

4183 2018-07-27 15:45:26 Libs are like stocks gotta buy them when they are their lowest and sell them at their highest point when they are actually functioning and contributing to society. It’s better to buy libs in bulk because far too often many never pan out to be of worth.

I don’t think they’re going away for good so the dip might be an entry opportunity for others .. we’ll see
4188 2018-07-27 15:44:26 It's happening to Twitter right now.  The stocks are down 18.5% since the opening bell.
4189 2018-07-27 15:44:18 Please give me a number of fair share. The Warren Buffett tax rate. He does not work he lives off his stocks. He has already payed taxes on the money he invested he Is paying of the gains. Just like any other retired person out there. I worked I saved I invested I retired.
4190 2018-07-27 15:43:38 $fb stocks never fall on actual fake news claims & fake accounts on their platform.. double standards

4192 2018-07-27 15:43:26 what a great month for BZM...

from 0.52p beginning of July to 1.14p and back down to 0.52p. Amazing company for sure...

so easy to tell the stocks who are used for P&D and the ones who are not. Healthy retraces are good but not 100% ones specially within 3-4weeks…

4199 2018-07-27 15:41:43 now that we are through a big week of earnings... will be interesting to see where institutional order flow (options & stocks) goes... 

will they buy more momo names or more value plays post earnings?

imo so much more important than pre-earnings flow which is mostly hedging
4200 2018-07-27 15:41:27 If you believe this mkt is about to rollover, then start shifting over to the Dow stocks as money rotate to value.
4201 2018-07-27 15:39:45 First FB and now TWTR. Not a great week for tech stocks.
4202 2018-07-27 15:39:34 Tech's decline outweighed the release of strong U.S. economic data. Just shows how important it is to have a diversified portfolio.

4203 2018-07-27 15:39:31 Agree with this speculation. They've been told that the gains could be substantial on even a small position if it "goes to zero", which they would... in the meanwhile, the market is looking for even glass half-full stocks to jump into after taking a bath on FB/INTL/NFLX/GM...
4204 2018-07-27 15:39:20 The impossibility of Brexit. Something never honestly told to the people by Leave campaigns.

4210 2018-07-27 15:38:08 TOO LATE @Twitter .... Stocks Are Dropping ...
4211 2018-07-27 15:37:41 Once upon a time, you were an idiot if you traded during pre-opening trading in stocks. Now it seems that many times you are an idiot if you don't. $SPX $NDX $IWM
4212 2018-07-27 15:37:29 Agreed!! But discussion was impact of Central Bank policy on Banks vs Deposit savers with low wealth/sophistication (i.e, not invested in bonds/stocks post GFC and deposit rate ~0) & Whether a Neg Real Rate of ~-1.5/1.7% hurts small savers and benefits big asset holders -It does!

4215 2018-07-27 15:36:45 Apparently all these tweets aren’t monetizing enough for #Twitter as their user numbers fall short and stock is down almost 20%. Not a good week for social media stocks $FB and $TWTR

4217 2018-07-27 15:36:19 Really? Then it would be great, but it’s unfortunate because I think the stocks of army bomb will, get out of stock that quick. But I really I hope it can change colors internationally, because I was disappointed in ver2, that only in Japan and Korea can change colors.
4218 2018-07-27 15:36:00 I'll never forget the time I took my taxes to HR Block, to do, with complicated equities trades, near 1500 + trades, on 4 accts. The lady was not happy with the time it would take, but eventually finished. My nickname there was "Trigger Fingers"...newbie with stocks that year.
4219 2018-07-27 15:35:56 Their stocks just took a 15% hit....
4220 2018-07-27 15:34:49 Think about this. Twitter and Facebook stocks are dying in a 4.1% GDP economy.

4221 2018-07-27 15:34:28 If you use juicy as an adjective when describing stocks or crypto, that’s an automatic unfollow from me.
4222 2018-07-27 15:34:28 i don't see stocks/shares as necessarily bad things... i mean if you want to have a worker owned coop, you need to have something to represent each person's stake in the company when it comes time to distribute the surplus, don't you?
4223 2018-07-27 15:34:25 The DOW is now closing out the week at all-time weekly highs in every major DM & EM currency except the JPY. The last safe haven left. Won’t be long until it catches up. The capital flows into US stocks are intensifying. RatesDOW
4224 2018-07-27 15:34:25 This is why my defensive stocks are screaming higher.  Again,  I might add.....
4225 2018-07-27 15:34:02 Indeed - nothing to do with them being overvalued hyper momentum stocks in a manic greed fest either
4226 2018-07-27 15:33:58 Mkt testing the limits of the "lower for longer" mantra, from a perspective of self-serving high crude $ dysphoria. Supply enviro is tight, and tightening, demand is continuing to exceed forecasts, and stocks are drawing quickly (record in US). Yet, risk shock is largely ignored.
4227 2018-07-27 15:33:46 Considering how well the stocks for @twitter and @facebook have been doing, I think I'll keep the visitor numbers for my website secret. Don't want my value to sink too much, after all.

4258 2018-07-27 15:22:54 The stocks have nothing to do with the people "losing trust". Their predictions revenues were off by a few decimals, which caused the drop in their stock. Read about it first before you just associate a person with the stock market.

4330 2018-07-27 15:00:12 HOT FINANCE TAKE

The decline of social media stocks in response to sustainability-minded management embodies everything wrong with the current shape of equity.

Facebook and Twitter should not lose record value by sacrificing quarterly growth for year-over-year sustainability.

4336 2018-07-27 14:59:11 But what they really did is buy back stocks and pocket the money.   Employees saw little to nothing (wages are actually down 2%) and few new jobs have been created.  Business do what’s good for them, not what’s good for employees.
4337 2018-07-27 14:59:10 Personally think $AMZN sees red today. Think the realization about how inflated all stocks are (especially tech) is going to kick in sooner than people will realize and the downside will be massive. Especially when GDP in Q3 Q4 is horrible and the bubble deflates.
4338 2018-07-27 14:58:52 The famous actress isn't actually picking the stocks, though.
4339 2018-07-27 14:57:51 That's a complete lie. Those "bonuses" were not far and few if any and the tax cuts went to stock buy backs to boost corporate stocks.

4366 2018-07-27 14:50:47 My dad opened us all our own ASB accounts at a young age, then diligently filled them up, then if/when they got full he opened others (ASB2, ASW, whatever). He invests in stocks and shares in our names, and lately has started naming us to properties.
4367 2018-07-27 14:50:36 Passive pump investing and Robotic Algorithm trading is going to end ugly for a lot of ETF's and hedges in the 2nd half of this year . No common sense and daily pumping of stocks.
4368 2018-07-27 14:50:26 According to @chrisbrecher, the January sell-off was in many ways pushed by the sell imbalance between stocks and bonds after the sharp December run-up.  Given July’s run-up, do we get the same next week?  Again, would be in confluence with the SPX/VIX [Jaws] spread...
4369 2018-07-27 14:49:59 Having a famous actress pick stocks for you is probably just as good a strategy as having a professional fund manager do it.

4403 2018-07-27 14:36:35 False narrative. This is due to surge in exports as foreign companies rushed to purchase US goods before the tariffs went into effect. No trickling down happening. Corps are giving execs bonuses and buying stocks back. American workers are not winning.

4407 2018-07-27 14:36:01 If you lose 20% of the value of your portfolio (like Facebook's loss yesterday), you need to make a 25% gain...just to break even.

The losses always hurt you more than the gains help you, which is why it's so important you protect the downside of your portfolio.

4439 2018-07-27 14:26:27 No, I didn't buy at said level.  Futures contracts are traded on BTC now.  It is very much a real investment vehicle with an attractive assymetry to other asset class returns.  Good luck with catching falling tech stocks.
4440 2018-07-27 14:26:13 Trump bring all of his economist out today. Because when the band-Aid comes off their will be a lot of blood.

4441 2018-07-27 14:26:09 3/ Volatility in the stock market and individual stocks happen when expectations are not achieved or are exceeded.  When expectations are achieved (especially on the low end) the stock market simply thinks of it as “par for the course”.

4474 2018-07-27 14:16:10 So, are #uranium bulls ready for the annual capital raising orgy? I suggest you all pour over financial statements of your favorite stocks. Are these companies mining uranium or mining your bank acct?
4475 2018-07-27 14:16:02 Now despite EPIC bond market propping up and Pres. Trumps 4.1 GDP, stocks falling under pressure. This IS getting interesting...

4578 2018-07-27 13:47:31 Presume this is American. Does "weaponizing" - never a verb - mean shooting? Presumably this "weaponising" is done to conserve stocks. Not a shooting person but would like to know.

4582 2018-07-27 13:45:34 The fall of the Facebook and Twitter stocks right now could be what trigger the next real financial depression. What we see right now might be called the tech bubble in the future.
4583 2018-07-27 13:45:22 Stocks are not the same as Bitcoin. I said about one FAKE news. News are manipulating crypto in every possible way. Stocks aren't so sensitive to news, or hack of one bank doesn't create FUD.

4607 2018-07-27 13:37:38 Robinhood is fantastic for investors. Trying to day trade just not the route to go down. There is a reason you pay for your execution with top of the line brokers.

4612 2018-07-27 13:36:40 I can tell you right now if @Twitter and @facebook want to see their stocks grow again, they need to announce major changes to their policies, changes that can be verified by their users. Admit to their wrongdoings, which everyone knows they did and commit to free speech. @jack
4613 2018-07-27 13:36:34 What is the way ahead?

4615 2018-07-27 13:36:05 Careful prognosticating economic momentum. Estimates say 1% of the 4% was due to stuffing of soybean stocks pre tariffs.

4620 2018-07-27 13:34:53 We know you hate taxes, Grover, but why haven't the tax cuts resulted in higher wages? Many companies used the savings to buy back stocks rather than pay their workers more. With inflation, many Americans have less buying power than they did a year or two ago.

4649 2018-07-27 13:23:13 Come to think of it, in Clinton's time people were talking about stocks, like Intel and Netscape, not whatever the GDP was. As Shakespeare would have said, The Nasdaq play's the thing.
4650 2018-07-27 13:22:49 Counter point for a more inclusive point of view... Maybe we value the timely news delivery and hence value Twitter more? We are into of stocks. Not everyone is into stocks? Value would be less...?

4668 2018-07-27 13:15:08 Trump has flip flopped on Russia election meddling, stormy Daniels, bump stocks, taking on the NRA, wanting to suspend due process, separating families at border, and tariffs to name a few. And are you serious? He has lied 3100+ times.

4698 2018-07-27 13:00:11 Thanks @EricBalchunas - at @BlueStarIndexes we are confident that the strong investment thesis for both broad #Israeli #equities via $ISRA and #Israel’s #Tech #Stocks (via the $ITEQ Israel Tech #ETF tracking our #BIGITech #Index) will ultimately prevail and the flows will follow
4699 2018-07-27 12:59:46 At what point do we consider shorting the lib stocks?
4700 2018-07-27 12:59:35 people dont realize that the Stock Market is just a fancy government protected ponzy scheme. case&point: if everyone traded in all their stocks for cash, there would get none!    N. O. N. E. !
4701 2018-07-27 12:59:05 This has been the story for the past 6-9 months.
Play NIFTY on its merit and its composition of stocks. 
Retail in general had the lust for Mid & Small-cap stocks in 2017, that's the reason for its fall. 
While NIFTY make its way down, Mid & Small cap may pull back / move up
4702 2018-07-27 12:58:53 Pls tell us how you churned your stocks in last 3years .you are putting a very old investment data .when you have bought the shares you listed ,if you have bought a lorry of sand it is also giving you the same return  today .time you spend also important .i respect your strategy
4703 2018-07-27 12:58:36 Taking into consideration GDP Price index. Real GDP growth is 3,2% not as expected at all. Time to buy EURUSD I guess. For Stocks this growth of GDP is OK any growth is positive.
4704 2018-07-27 12:58:02 Can't really say I am surprised Facebook stocks took a big hit.
4705 2018-07-27 12:57:51 Are we living the .com bubble AGAIN?
Facebook and Twitter business reveals being too sensitive

4707 2018-07-27 12:57:46 Which, I think this means every analyst was blind sided and have no idea what to expect.  Look at the moves of FB, TWTR, AMZN. 

If they saw it coming, the stocks wouldnt have moved so much.
4708 2018-07-27 12:57:27 When ya check your stocks and your daily gains are up there bwoy 
4709 2018-07-27 12:57:19 $awx All over my feed w/shorts & longs arguing. I don't think ne1 long actually thinks this is permanent. We all know it'll fall back to reality, but u have 2 be able 2 trade both sides! Personally these kinds of stocks blew up my account b4 so I'm just watching 4 entertainment.
4710 2018-07-27 12:57:01 Italian stocks taking a hit, with BTP as well
4711 2018-07-27 12:56:53 U.S Federal Reserve in pursuit to make its partners rich, by pumping Face book,Amazon,Tesla,Twitter & other Internet stocks caused inflation
4712 2018-07-27 12:56:33 $SPY GDP good, but a miss = flatter yield curve. Watch the financials today $XLF #stocks #markets
4713 2018-07-27 12:56:31 Consumers not motivated by financial numbers: active daily users; earnings v. estimates; stock prices.  Company performance is the result of consumer involvement.  Remember "Ackman selling Penney Stocks"?
Sell what the consumers want to buy.
Find a need and fill it.

Boksburg Upstairs, Only While Stocks Last
4715 2018-07-27 12:55:53 As I'm reading this headline I then read that Chevron stocks are dropping because of a loss of profits. Just seems odd.
4716 2018-07-27 12:55:29 Point and case!! 

Do I need to remind you that you have to breathe in and out all day long to stay alive, or is it something that you just are ready know?
4717 2018-07-27 12:55:02 kith will have 2k stocks
4718 2018-07-27 12:54:13 If you're not knowledgeable on equity, credit, investments, stocks, ownership, etc. 9x out of 10 you won't be able to save up the kind of money you need to live your dream life!!
4719 2018-07-27 12:53:09 If anybody was thinking about buying Facebook stocks after today would be the time.
4720 2018-07-27 12:52:12 I want these tech stocks I have to perform well but my guts says Jack’s net worth (and zuckerberg) will come crashing down in the next year or two.
4721 2018-07-27 12:51:29 Why can't we also be like Venezuela - stocks in Venezuela are up over 73,000% in the past year! #hyperinflation #stocks
4722 2018-07-27 12:51:28 Corporations with publicly traded stocks are quasi government institutions. Pseudo monopolies pose unique challenges.
4723 2018-07-27 12:50:34 Bitcoin still weak this morning. I will expect Bitcoin stocks to be weak today as well. But it is a long day. Anything can happen
4724 2018-07-27 12:50:20 Did these investors cash in their stock, or were their stocks seized as in assets and bank accounts being seized due to illicit activity/ illegal proceeds??? I'm curious! #QAnon #QTeam #QPosts #QArmy @prayingmedic @IngrahamAngle @seanhannity @Potus @LouDobbs @DoctorQAnon #QamI
4725 2018-07-27 12:50:07 Mark Zuckerberg won't care because he got enough money  from the fools who bought the stocks. They are still trying to get their money back.
4726 2018-07-27 12:49:33 In order to get #earlyretired, I will  need to get multi-income. First one is from from my labor. Second one is from investment in index funds and stocks. Third one is from my own business. Since I've already had first and second one, next thing to do is to make third one.
4727 2018-07-27 12:48:41 His mates took part in the Ramp, shorted at the top, took part in the placing so it dont matter how far the shares fall, they can't lose. Happened last time and will happen next time
4728 2018-07-27 12:48:38 Twitter stock fell 19% in premarket trading this morning and they will tell you it's a correction don't worry. Tech stocks have a tendency to go belly-up real quick. I'd get out while the getting out is good. don't be left getting the birdie.

4731 2018-07-27 12:46:42 Many analyst calling bottom in Pharma, in my view its not going to come anytime sooner. Lupin & Cipla are the better amongst Pharma stocks in NIFTY Index

Expected downside

SUNPH - Below 200
DRR - 3 digit
AUROPH - below 350
LUPIN - 620-550
CIPLA - 470/376
4732 2018-07-27 12:45:56 Social media stocks taking dives
4733 2018-07-27 12:45:40 SUMMER LUVIN: Q2 GDP growth hits 4.1%. Fastest growth rate since 2014. Third fastest since Great Recession. Interest rates still below historical trends. And equities are on the rise, sitting just beneath January's all-time high. Tech, defense and healthcare stocks look strong.
4734 2018-07-27 12:45:06 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 10 stocks Thursday including $NXPI, $TWTR and  $ALLY.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 136% in $KNX where August 30.0 calls bought for $1.15 closed at $2.73.
4735 2018-07-27 12:45:05 Seems like the FB stocks are dodgy as over the last few months..
4736 2018-07-27 12:44:36 @NewDay The stuck piling that makes the economy look good will mean it takes a hit later because they will have stocks. Can't replace salary increase with bonuses. Bonuses are SMALL. 
4737 2018-07-27 12:44:21 Yesterday stocks were 25.5K.  Even with Facebook holding down markets, stocks will reach 26K or higher today anybody wanna bet?

4740 2018-07-27 12:43:06 Stocks fluctuate so investors win (or lose) and it gives companies incentives to keep innovating. It doesn't kill the company.

The USA economy, jobs, stocks and security are the envy of the World
4742 2018-07-27 12:42:41 can we start calling the trend of wearing socks and birkenstocks as “socks ‘n’ stocks”?
4743 2018-07-27 12:42:10 Stocks making the biggest moves premarket: TWTR, MRK, CL, AMZN, SBUX & more ...
4744 2018-07-27 12:41:47 Malheureusement, le gel ne s’arrête pas aux frontières et à également touché les pays voisins. Les pommes européennes, que nous importons en priorité lorsque les stocks manquent en Suisse, ont rapidement été écoulées.
4745 2018-07-27 12:40:44 2. This makes this a HUGE gamble on the part of US Steel, which is probably why their stocks DROPPED after they announced, in March, the plant reopening.
4746 2018-07-27 12:40:43 GDP up to 4.2%... Stocks near all time highs..crime near all time lows...Obama.. only POTUS never to have a GDP of 3%...We have full employment... BUT.. CNN ignores all this ... only purpose.. Impeach our President... very sad..
4747 2018-07-27 12:40:09 Junk social media stocks
4748 2018-07-27 12:39:58 That is for sure
People forget that the typewriter, the key to a hotel room, Pay Phones and investors that invested in future tech.

The trend is Spotify, Lyft, 

I don't see anyone posting about their acquisition of movie phone.

4751 2018-07-27 12:38:25 Does stocks to trade have a tool to let you see which stocks are trading above their typical volume in real time, or do you just get an end of day search option? Trying to decide if it’s worth the price tag with my little account.
4752 2018-07-27 12:38:05 Looks like that cruise had already left the port for #Twitter and #Facebook as their stocks plunge! 4.1 Growth 
4753 2018-07-27 12:37:33 Spent 1T in tax cuts for 4.1% lol which was for me to buy more stocks. My spending as actually gone down massively in FH2018. I do give more to strippers since I need a place to unwind and breath deeply, Plan today 60min of work and beach. Enjoy the weekend
4754 2018-07-27 12:37:24 Russia does not use stocks in tanks to help boost oil output and does not have enough stocks to influence the oil market, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters
4755 2018-07-27 12:36:42 Ok, so Facebook and Twitter stocks have crashed after clean-ups. Now, it's time for Instagram to purge all fake accounts. There's too much negativity, propaganda and hate everywhere. Social media was supposed to bring the world closer, not tear it apart.
4756 2018-07-27 12:36:39 #Facebook stocks dropping off a cliff.  Could one reason be people's disgust for the company's role in the stolen 2016 election and its dreary outcome?
4757 2018-07-27 12:35:59 As if I just found out about a local indie who stocks a small amount of @PiccalillyUK and @kiteclothing and currently has a sale on 
4758 2018-07-27 12:34:54 Watch for tech stocks related to social media platforms drop.
4759 2018-07-27 12:34:34 Adding to demand side increases valuation, and therefore co’s ability to finance. In this case, it’s a finger on the scale. In other problematic HK stocks, index funds are significant portions of float. Also, suspect index buyers often lift offers, creating outsize price impact.
4760 2018-07-27 12:33:42 Ffs I'm so fkn sick of this next generation bullshit, and 60% of arsenal fans are always competing prices and economical sides of team they have no stocks in.. degenerate  twitter warriors..

4762 2018-07-27 12:33:04 Everyone else: I don’t look at my money market account.

Me: *meltdown* Oh my god. My two tiny Robinhood stocks went down again. Let me obsessively check them until they go back up!
4763 2018-07-27 12:32:53 I reduced my exposure to High-Cap US stocks a few days after getting back from Vacation. Dodged a bullet by accident. $FB $TWTR $XOM

It's all in high-dividend low-volatility ETFs now.
4764 2018-07-27 12:32:50 $SPY So #GDP below expectations. UST rising a bit, USD a tad weaker. US Futures dropping on the news. #markets #stocks
4765 2018-07-27 12:32:45 Me neither. Some of these stats seem outlandish but when you think the top 10% of the country owns 87% of stocks, there is a direct correlation there in terms of financial habits and actual assets
4766 2018-07-27 12:32:26 I think we will see more and more people switch their monies from stocks to crypto. 2019 will be a big big year for cryptocurrency

4770 2018-07-27 12:30:59 There’s a few funds that you can invest with that are short focused ... or you can short trade stocks on various markets.
4771 2018-07-27 12:30:03 Hey Jack, 

You’re stocks have now dropped 20%... 

How’s that censorship working out for you?
4772 2018-07-27 12:29:06 The Rally in Nifty from March 2018 of over 1150 points has been led basically by 5 Stocks which have contributed approx 40% in the Rally
4773 2018-07-27 12:28:37 No way. Wait a few months or a year. Do your homework. This is a good play in the long run but now is not the best time to jump in. Pot stocks have farther to fall before initial speculators stop fleeing, companies prove themselves in recreational pot, and real investors step in.
4774 2018-07-27 12:28:02 Thanks Caroline - coming from you that means a lot!

Yeah that cost me 3500.00 extra dollars in payout this year alone... oh and it’s now okay to kick me out of anywhere cause I’m Gay. Take a seat.
4779 2018-07-27 12:26:29 $TWTR #stocks in pre-market is after -14.59% above short term(2 years) and above long term(5 years) fair values.
I believe, this plunge is much more related to panic than reality. Mostly caused by unstability of #social #networks #stocks as a whole in reaction to $FB reasons
4780 2018-07-27 12:26:26 Been on the waiting list for months just to check it out. Lost interest now and just use of for standard stocks.

4784 2018-07-27 12:24:18 Because most of the biggest auto stocks like Diamler, GE, Tesla, VW,Ford etc. trades at a very low valuation, except from Tesla. The industry valuation of Auto companies internationally is cheap if you compare it with Indian Companies.

4787 2018-07-27 12:23:06 Pot stocks and ETFs are not profitable or bullish right now. Anyone interested should wait a few months (or 1-2 years) for the recreational companies to prove themselves in . Jumping in now is like throwing 10-20% of your money away. I encourage everyone to do their HW first
4788 2018-07-27 12:22:21 You cant read. I repeat, normal people don't worry about stocks they don't own. We worry about making money on the ones we do, and having good relationships with family and friends.

4806 2018-07-27 12:15:52 It's very hard to imagine central banks sitting back and watching stocks plunge beyond 20-30% at this point. This is their bubble and there's nobody else to blame for it.

4808 2018-07-27 12:15:02 So, if it’s just 4.0 or 3.8, it’ll be viewed as bad news, and stocks will plummet? Wasn’t so long ago that Trump was ridiculed for saying he’d achieve higher growth.

4818 2018-07-27 12:12:08 God, I can't wait until I can sell my stocks. Gonna pay off my damn car and some other bills, finally.
4819 2018-07-27 12:12:08 When market panics, many stocks fall. This is the time to look at those stong companies with good corporate governance which can grow their EPS in coming future. Ofcouse valuation matters.
4820 2018-07-27 12:11:17 yep,  i try to follow the “big stock principle” for a majority of my holdings.....invest in liquid stocks that are a must own by institutions that are usually tech leaders that are changing the way we live (such as fang stocks).

4824 2018-07-27 12:10:34 Hahahaha! Your followers have stocks???
4825 2018-07-27 12:07:04 I haven’t found anybody that can give me a positive makes-the-world-a-better-place reason for bump stocks to exist.
There may be a good reason that I just don’t know yet. If so, please enlighten me. If not, retweet this to see if your followers know of one.
I’ll wait.
4826 2018-07-27 12:06:53 One of the most disgusting instance was recent claim by well-known wannabe that #gold buyers are losers when in fact he was writing articles about gold outperforming stocks a few years back. All evidence is saved and all those idiots will be exposed big time.
4827 2018-07-27 12:06:29 Nifty Index is a scam nowadays, they just include high performing stocks and remove average and low performers, what a joke it has become. Much worser than the window dressing done by Indian banks at financial year ends, begging depositors not to draw amounts till March 31 , lol.
4828 2018-07-27 12:05:13 Good.  But I observed SMA 10 & 20 most of time doesn't gives right signal in Stocks. However in NIFTY it works well.
4829 2018-07-27 12:05:02 Prediction for 2019:

4830 2018-07-27 12:05:01 You don’t understand stocks... please shut up. 

Market cap does not reflect profits or revenue. It is a value of those data points.
4831 2018-07-27 12:04:59 SuperUs: Kids get stocks as gift & investment if you’re living in HK. I’ve only heard about adults buying stocks in my entire life.

4842 2018-07-27 12:02:05 One misconception people CONSTANTLY make about Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies is that they are ANONYMOUS. Blockchain integrity is built around the fact anyone can audit the ENTIRE log

4845 2018-07-27 12:01:26 1. The stocks are still significantly below where they would have been without the deals. 

2. Betting against all merger synergies makes sense. Check base rates. 

3. Deals are driven more by management ambition than economic sense. 

4. Synergy = Mr. India. Do hear, can’t see.
4846 2018-07-27 12:00:32 Word of the Day Example:

4848 2018-07-27 12:00:29 In equity mutual funds I enter in assuming that it can correct up to 30% and in direct stocks much more like 50%.

If you don't want value to go down at all and most like would like to see it increase every other day at least by 0.01% or so invest in liquid funds pls..
4849 2018-07-27 12:00:21 Yeah. Should have stuck with the bank stocks and gone completely bankrupt.

4855 2018-07-27 11:54:59 People cheering about Facebook stock falling seem to not understand how stock market works but that’s none of my business. In this socialistic future people dream of, there are no stocks.
4856 2018-07-27 11:54:47 I call stocks like that “Liquidity Traps”.  You can get in, but you can’t get out!
4857 2018-07-27 11:54:26 We need to wrap on stocks bro.
4858 2018-07-27 11:53:45 Everyone has been conditioned to “buy the dip” for 9 years. All cycles end and most of the cult stocks of this era are now breaking down from parabolas. Full retraces are typical. TWTR not as bad as others you discuss (NFLX, WWE, etc) but testing $25 would be “normal”.
4859 2018-07-27 11:53:22 Why not life @facebook he threatened to kill a person. A "regular" person would be in much bigger trouble and what happened to @facebook removing people like him permanently bc kids see it?  @facebook stocks for bullies.
4860 2018-07-27 11:52:13 What if corporate valuation wasn’t measured in stocks or investments, but based on a social credit system?
4861 2018-07-27 11:51:38 Please note he was selling off huge amounts of stocks in Facebook before the stock price crashed just like other insiders! SEC should be doing a full investigation of possible illegal trading practices! 
4862 2018-07-27 11:51:13 That's the way index operates. 
It's important for the Index traders to understand the weightage of stocks in INDEX and their major trend. 
The weightage are subject to change each quarter, tracking it is most important.
4863 2018-07-27 11:51:02 I’d like every ETF audited to ensure every dollar of their worth is held and accounted for.  Stocks are manipulated more than cryptos, the fact you think they’re not is hilarious!

5185 2018-07-27 08:08:50 The last 10 years has bred an army of investors and speculators who assume that stocks and markets move in only one direction. So they have no need to read up, check up or wise up $TSLA 
5186 2018-07-27 08:06:46 Up early and preparing to make 5 figures today, I already have two stocks lined up for those of you in the #MentorPorgram make sure you check the watch-list, it's golden
5187 2018-07-27 08:05:26 China stocks lower at close of trade; Shanghai Composite down 0.30%
5188 2018-07-27 08:04:15 Immersion is a big thing for me, in many of the games I play.
Current immersion problem: I'm drinking coffee all the time.
Wish I could choose Tea.  Like, when you start the game, choose Dog/Cat and Coffee/Tea (for what Gus stocks and Merchant sells)

5191 2018-07-27 08:02:01 People seriously invest in property? I couldn't think of a worse market to invest in. Individuals can make more return on stocks and shares in a year than property would give them in 5. The reason people invest in property is because it's seen as easy

5209 2018-07-27 07:40:43 I admit: completely missed FANG-stocks and especially AMZN due to mental barrier (valuation).
Yesterday's earnings for Q2-18 USD 5, annualized USD 20. If in 5yrs EPS at USD 50 (20% growth p.a.) and stock up 10% over same period, P/E ratio at 58x - no room for errors!

5210 2018-07-27 07:39:35 Billions of USD in losses isn´t a "normal" case of up and down of stocks in a company´s life. Here has been proved a mishandling of crises, referencing Cambridge Analytica and in an election in wich many still want to prove that the Russians elected Trump, and Americans did not.

5307 2018-07-27 06:24:31 What's funny? The app would have been nothing if nobody used it. Remember MySpace? How is Snapchat's stocks doing by the way.
5308 2018-07-27 06:23:47 #stocks at or near their highs can have strong finishes because there are no sellers trying to get back square.  Example #xao longs $AKM $ALL $ATS $COE $LVT $WTC
5309 2018-07-27 06:22:30 you think i make enough money to own stocks?  lol
5310 2018-07-27 06:20:19 That’s why Facebook stocks fell all the way down too, they don’t protect the people
5311 2018-07-27 06:19:05 Think, market has reached at all time high because of "long term conviction" in buying. Its another matter the focus is shifted from mid&small caps to only few large cap index (growth) stocks with renewed vigour!

If high index level attracts further buying, isn't that secondary?
5312 2018-07-27 06:17:12 One and only Prashant jain .who else? HE has married those 2 stocks for lifetime

5319 2018-07-27 06:10:55 #QAnon Do you think stock market flow can be manipulated? Does 12-17 Act play out in tariffs? Would gov's turn over assets? Did MZ sell FB stocks? Who's $ invested? ?401k's? Did FB/Gov use app in foreign country to change public? Did EU fine MZ/FB? No tariffs ~ foreign assests?
5320 2018-07-27 06:10:49 Lol read it in passing that stocks crashed or something
5321 2018-07-27 06:07:52 And, I am heavily invested in Mid & small caps... My portfolio is down by 13-14% in last 2 months :(

@shachinb Nifty Index has 50 stocks... 63-65% of total m-cap 
But if only 3-4 stocks out of 50 are gaining...that it is not true reflection of stock market.. not healthy at all
5322 2018-07-27 06:07:34 @bts_bighit y’all better make this ver 3 last a long time though and not release a new one every 2 years. It’s unnecessary and y’all don’t even make enough stocks for everyone.

5333 2018-07-27 06:02:39 Looks that way! I haven't sat on the computer like this most of the day and bought so many stocks since the start of the year! Bring it on I say!
5334 2018-07-27 06:02:20 Rates were low in 2003, but investors shunned growth stocks (particularly tech & biotech) for several years due to their memory of being burned in the tech bust. They chased EM & industrials, etc. because that's where the short-term "growth" was in that cycle. Not about rates.
5335 2018-07-27 06:02:06 Pt 3 bump stocks, which admittedly is just a novelty but it’s still an infringement. They want to be mainstream and known by all as “gun rights”. To be known by the masses, they must be palatable. This makes them moderate. One of the biggest points where they drop the ball

5340 2018-07-27 05:59:23 That "duration" theory of growth stock bubbles is interesting, but I'm not entirely convinced. We had high long rates in late '90s, and it didn't dent mania for growth stocks--only their secular growth slowdown ended it. I think it's largely behavioral, i.e. extrapolation/greed.
5341 2018-07-27 05:58:54 $GXY shouldn't fall too far. If it does no doubt new major shareholder Morgan Stanley will just release a report globally stating 'Lithium Stocks To Go Stellar'

5343 2018-07-27 05:57:28 That would actually explain everything about how the stock market works.

5362 2018-07-27 05:44:39 The house is not auctioned on a daily basis. Stocks are auctioned so looking is unavoidable for the majority of people. This is the reason why people should not buy individual stocks.
5363 2018-07-27 05:44:08 YEAH a bonus from ordering from Kinokuniya specifically is usually how it goes

We'll see for sure later tho!! Esp if their English speaking store stocks em too
5364 2018-07-27 05:43:52 I think that would be Zuckerberg...but I believe his reign is about up though. Stocks down & stockholders want him removed after his show CEO. Good bye, Mr Theif in the night Zuckerberg! #DeleteFacebook #ZuckerbergFraud #ZuckerburgSellingOurPrivacy #Zuckerburgbiasstopsnow
5365 2018-07-27 05:43:08 The thing about charting an index/etf is that they are comprised of thousands of moving parts. It's the stocks that make a market, not the market that moves the stocks. Charting the main holdings of the etf would be better and could either confirm or reject your hypothesis.

Who Agrees?
5371 2018-07-27 05:37:51 @markessien Hi.. You talk about tech stocks much. How can someone invest in these from here. Can you do a thread sometime or send me links on how to.. Thanks alot.
5372 2018-07-27 05:36:01 what you're saying is the modern approach to low to mid digital workflow.
isn't always the best with film stocks and even 8k

You don't know the stock market 
Microsoft has lost billions of dollars many times in the past stocks went back up they were worth more than before
5376 2018-07-27 05:33:35 I’m a HUGE fan of the longer interview @JulieChen did with Kaitlyn. @CBSBigBrother should do longer interviews like this with the evicted HG (raw interview of emotion immediately after walking out of house...still have #offtheblock the following day to recap and interview) #bb20
5377 2018-07-27 05:32:05 Rally started with #IT & #FMCG carry forward by  #HDFCBank twins then #Reliance and now #Itc and many more large cap stocks contributed , large cap stock is totally a winner in 2018 !!

5381 2018-07-27 05:29:47 Stock market speculation fuels bubbles. Fortunes are made. Fortunes are lost. And the little investor often buys in when stocks are overvalued & takes huge losses when a major correction occurs. My advice: Do your research & do not attempt to time the market.
5382 2018-07-27 05:29:01 oh they most definitely will! They had huge stocks of ARMY bombs at the tour last year & in their announcement about UPS shipping, they said they matched the online price to the on-site price of buying them at the concerts, which means they’ll for sure be selling at the venues :)
5383 2018-07-27 05:27:57 Watch stocks it go's down then back up Facebook will have the money back

They were DUMPING their stocks a few months ago,  while it was HIGH and finished last month on the sales. 

Almost like they KNEW the stock was Going to TANK.
5387 2018-07-27 05:25:16 8 years of simulated market growth & Central Bank cash, completely disconnected from reality underpinning stocks.

5394 2018-07-27 05:21:40 Would you agree think no congresspeople or any of their family should work in business? Because I'd be fine with that. But they all own stocks. Should we mandate that they all get pensions and nobody in their family should ever be able to work for private business again?
5395 2018-07-27 05:21:10 Will the old guards of bulls in the form of consumer stocks (Britannia, Nestle and HUL) and retail banking stocks (Kotak and Indusind) give way for emerging consumer themes (ITC) and undervalued corporate banks (SBI and ICICI) in the form of some capital reallocation
5396 2018-07-27 05:20:35 All economists (right-leaning, left-leaning) agree that wealth is relative; that the ueber-wealthy have seen their wealth expand geometrically because they own assets like houses and stocks; and that such assets have rocketed up in value (esp. compared to wages) because of QE.

5398 2018-07-27 05:19:54 The likehood of another implosion of tech stocks is inevitable, those things are overvalued and highly inflated. Can someone explain the market cap and trading levels of these tech companies that overnight are worth trillion of $? What is the underlying asset?

5402 2018-07-27 05:18:45 Facebook dropped 120 billion dollars in stocks today. My theory is investors saw that video of that big manager bitch beat the shit out of that tiny chick with her tits flapping all about in McDonalds and said "Well, this platform has peaked. It's all downhill from here"

5413 2018-07-27 05:10:20 Truth is one should not be buying individual stocks. Too risky. If you are investing a lot of money, then you are better off going with the more established brokerages. They have better tools & interfaces + better real time price. Robinhood prices are delayed. Good learning tool

5428 2018-07-27 05:00:35 High valuations of banking and NBFC stocks based on extrapolation of AADHAR linked, future cash flow backed small ticket loans growth seems like the 'Eye-ball count' data based dot-com valuation of '99 and 'Land bank' data based real estate s ctor valuations of '07 ?
5429 2018-07-27 05:00:22 investing and barely beating inflation while your assets are seizable by creditors just doesn’t make sense to me.

If a portfolio of $100000 was positioned 100% in FB, loss = $20000
If  FB was 50% of portfolio,  loss = $10000
If FB was at 5% of portfiolio,  loss =20% of 5000 = $1000, or 1% of toal portfolio.

5472 2018-07-27 04:27:48 I remember reading about calls and puts on AA stocks that was completely out of the norm. People banked and tried to cash in on 9/11 implying they had foreknowledge. Some went unclaimed.  These would be great areas to dig into. If only Mueller had some bank records somewhere...

5483 2018-07-27 04:15:27 If you have any money put aside for future investments. Hold off on investing (for now) & start researching the different stocks being affected by tariffs on the stock market. Because these tariffs are going to be financial game changers in the long run.

5493 2018-07-27 04:06:00 The rest of understanding stocks is just further complications of how you can speculate to basically con others into paying you more than what you own is actually worth and you really only need to know it if you’re obsessive about understanding it because of neuroses like I am :/

5504 2018-07-27 03:59:01 Frank nailed this, buying stocks makes the price go up (more demand) and selling them makes it go down (more supply). So your hope is that people continue to want to buy the stock so that you can sell at a higher (and overvalued) position and make a profit.

5507 2018-07-27 03:55:56 The other reason (and why the market tends to be ridiculous at stability) is that people use stocks as a speculative instrument with the hope that someone will be willing to pay more in the future. And the price people will pay is based on supply/demand (# selling vs # buying)
5508 2018-07-27 03:55:52 Javanka has pocketed over $Billion using the USGov that I know of & more counting stocks with inside trading
5509 2018-07-27 03:54:46 O common everyone on TV said buy the dip. The amount of paper wealth that will be gone soon is staggering. Will mom and pops get a bailout for their blind investment into these crazy stocks...
5510 2018-07-27 03:54:00 Most of the time companies will want to reinvest these profits (to make more) but sometimes they pay out to the people that own the company in the form of “dividends” which is a fixed payout per share. So this is one reason people buy stocks, they get cash as part of the profits
5511 2018-07-27 03:53:46 You know a stock can trade 2.5 million shares and still be illiquid right? Please do not tell me I have a lot to learn when you’re 4 years into trading still risking a ridiculous 4% of your account trading garbage penny stocks and listening to Tim Sykes... YOU have a lot to learn

5514 2018-07-27 03:50:11 Surely quite difficult to achieve 30% return with 40 holdings, as you are diluting your gains with every new addition. From 20 stocks the portfolio drastically starts to mimick a tracker there onwards. Quite impressive anyone achieving that - well done if you did!
5515 2018-07-27 03:49:34 1999, 20 Nasdaq stocks that were above 5 bucks rose at least 900% I eventually rode EXDS down to zero  (Funny now,not then!)

5525 2018-07-27 03:42:15 Are you not aware that an executive order by Trump to ban bump stocks or raise the age to 21 to buy guns won’t be a permanent law? It requires a bill to be passed by the House and Senate & then the President’s signature to be a permanent law. The left says the GOP are uneducated?
5526 2018-07-27 03:42:11 Then we better sell our shares of sleeping pill stocks.

5531 2018-07-27 03:35:51 And how are the stocks doing now, Marcus?

5547 2018-07-27 03:24:53 Which is why @POTUS said he will be launching and investigation. Better drop your Twitter stocks STAT!! Look at what happened to the FB Zucker, lost 24% in minutes! More than 1/2 the country is conservative  and we have had enough of the double standards and attacks!!

2. These are the trends that blew up on social media. Do all of these before these dates. 

3. You’re going to be a dad in a couple years. Don’t freak out

5563 2018-07-27 03:18:41 With Facebook stocks tanking & twitter shadow banning I think we are looking at the end of social media as we know it and maybe a new iteration beginning.

5565 2018-07-27 03:17:58 Facebook stocks lost 119 Billion dollars today. With recent light of the privacy issue, this is one of the most drastic spike in stocks I've seen
5566 2018-07-27 03:17:52 It seems though, that investors are punishing #Facebook for investing in privacy & security (revenue will slow as spending increases). If FB, or any companys stocks takes a hit, it should be for a LACK of investment in privacy/security
5567 2018-07-27 03:17:36 Stocks are bit shocking for Facebook.
5568 2018-07-27 03:16:51 Lol it’s Twitter, most of your followers are broke 23 year olds investing in $4 stocks and cryptos, they can’t afford $FB shares
5569 2018-07-27 03:16:31 If you look closely at most of the stocks, everything looks like a fucking bubble. The next economic crisis is going to be fun
5570 2018-07-27 03:16:30 Yes, the hedge can be very large at times. I typically have many holdings, so I find it easier to get in and out of one large hedge position than trading in and out of 40 stocks.
5571 2018-07-27 03:16:24 Seriously so many options. $BIOAQ had a dip, but could still be a good entry given the 7/31 buyout dl.  $GRPS $FLTT $HEME $CCLX $EORZ all major potential in the next days. And MJ stocks are a buy.  fuckin' a man!
5572 2018-07-27 03:15:11 Buying up lots Facebook shares TODAY, facebook is just for moms now and is wayyyy past its prime but people don't know they own so much other shit...after todays news. BUYYYYYY #stocks #bonds #tech #money

5574 2018-07-27 03:13:31 Tech stocks have long been seen as immune to market fluctuations. Today kinda disproved that theory.

5580 2018-07-27 03:09:53 The Dow moves above 25500 for the first time since late February. Will 25500 become support or resistance? $DIA In #ErlangerChartRoom only two Dow stocks have a technical rank above 50%, $V and $MSFT.  10 stocks in Dow see tech rank below 50%.
5581 2018-07-27 03:09:48 Although analysts say companies are on their best financial footing in years, more investors fear stocks are going to languish in the second half of the year.
5582 2018-07-27 03:08:56 I’ve wanted to learn more about stocks and bonds but again I’m just clueless and I worry about putting my money in a financial advisors hands. Any tips?
5583 2018-07-27 03:08:29 Ooh nice. That sounds pretty good. 

When I make gyoza I often use this Yuzu sauce that my local asian grocer stocks. Not sure on brand.
5584 2018-07-27 03:08:12 I was talking to my boss the other day and I would like to share knowledge. Work and save because if you want to *actually* retire when you're 65 (or earlier) you need to start saving literally now. Good pensions. Stocks.
(you're all welcome)
5585 2018-07-27 03:06:38 Moon did I use enough rocket ships lol
5586 2018-07-27 03:06:18 I don’t think you can make a comparison with  stocks. Bitcoin is a monetary system which has never existed before.

5590 2018-07-27 03:03:33 That's probably autocorrect, but taken as is, I actually do, and it's why I prefer to invest non-perishable assets rather than stocks.  You may not be able to get a tank of gas with a wristwatch, but you can use it to bribe your through a checkpoint to leave a war zone.
5591 2018-07-27 03:03:09 As of 11:00 a.m., PSEi 7,615.06 down 50.79 points or 0.66 percent.  #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
5592 2018-07-27 03:02:55 You'd need lot less for retirement if the value of assets like stocks & homes weren't inflated from being taxed less than ordinary income & inherited virtually tax free. You'd also be able to save more for retirement if your income wasn't taxed. Most people's 401k doesn't cut it
5593 2018-07-27 03:02:52 So you close every trade by mid day? If only sl hits otherwise you can hold in end of session. Stocks move for real in first and last hour
5594 2018-07-27 03:02:36 Zuck isn’t crying. He dumped most of his stocks before he went to Congress for his embarrassing hearings. Months ago

5600 2018-07-27 02:59:50 If you are participating in insider trading why would you dump your whole position within hours or even days? This is why tech stocks are hard to get excited about.
5601 2018-07-27 02:59:41 With $FB losing $120bn in share price 20% plunge after dismal earnings while $AMZN up after strong results perhaps analysts will not blindly back #FAANG stocks anymore. Don't be surprised: Facebook is a media platform. But Amazon has a "proper" business distributing goods
5602 2018-07-27 02:58:35 KR1Ms should be self-sustaining without ministerial grants, if they are to be maintained. It could be used by factories to clear their near-expiry (yet edible) stocks at stunningly low prices. It could also be expanded into factory-outlets for non-food items.
5603 2018-07-27 02:56:52 FACT: Worker pay in the second quarter dropped nearly one percent below its first-quarter level.

FACT: Wages fell 1.4 percent from 2017, effecting 80% of industries & 2/3 of metro areas affected.

FACT: Worker wages drop while companies spend $700 billion to boost stocks
5604 2018-07-27 02:56:05 Arms have been available though. I'm concerned, like someone said below, that the .500 record since May is going to be the excuse when they don't make a move. We'll get some crap about the "right deal" while everyone else stocks up.
5605 2018-07-27 02:54:48 Many stocks lose 5-10% when their high profile CEOs die (some go up, but it's easy to fcst which), so a serial killer/hedge fund collusion has always been around. I think the problem is that as a practical matter it is a suicide mission for the killer, and their fam gets nothing.

5677 2018-07-27 02:18:08 1) What do you mean "you people"?
2) You have no right to my time, my labor, or my property.
3) Socialism is just a nicer word for "slavery".
5678 2018-07-27 02:17:21 Of course the bank bailout was a handout. And don't worry, socialist elites are real good at that sort of thing.
5679 2018-07-27 02:17:19 need a stocks crash course  because this shit is too much

5681 2018-07-27 02:16:43 Reddit is an interesting application. One minute you’re reading about oral sex techniques and the next you’re reading about the quarterly growth of Facebook stocks  shits weird.
5682 2018-07-27 02:16:23 So they think mark twinkletoes sinkinburg stocks are falling the bigger they are the harder they will crash an burn it will be a matter of time b4 its Twitter's turn remember my space

5684 2018-07-27 02:15:35 Great week. Process is now quick and simple, but execution takes two scans with different software.  
1. Identify strongest uptrends. #stocks #equities #trading
2. Know where 14 & 30 day support prices are. #forceindex
3. Then buy new strength. Might or might not be ATHs
5685 2018-07-27 02:15:00 That’s terrible Tom I don’t see most of the people I follow tweets and when I looked them up I can’t find them most of the time and it’s only going to get worse.. i’m glad Facebook’s stocks dropped they screwed a lot of conservatives and Trump supporters.
5686 2018-07-27 02:14:53 I went to a local with my friend and I had to fight this kid in what I assumed was his first tourney. I played bayo and he played kirby and I continued to take him off the top all 4 stocks all with a deadpan expression on my face. 

I think he cried...
5687 2018-07-27 02:14:46 ERIC you are cracking me up tonight!!!!!
5688 2018-07-27 02:12:56 His stocks are going to plummet, just like his buddy @zuckerberg over at #Facebook ... wonder how many millions he will lose? Smarten up @jack and knock off the conservative censorship. #TheGreatAwakening #TheRainMakers will #MakeItRain .@POTUS heard  us and called you out!
5689 2018-07-27 02:12:46 . @facebook literally lost $100billion in value today and literally nobody at the business will be impacted outside of stock holdings.

5693 2018-07-27 02:10:17 Yup but that’s my point. Comparing bitcoin gains from start to stocks from IPO is misleading. Crypto allows anyone to be an early investor where stocks have private rounds. 

Comparing bitcoin gains to major stock gains from series A is the right way.

5705 2018-07-27 02:02:14 yeah possible, market punishing tech stocks badly on missing market expectations
5706 2018-07-27 02:01:52 #MoviePass from $HMNY was a good idea until other companies started doing it & now all of the sudden people want us to think it’s not a good idea anymore.

I’m fully capable of thinking for myself, I do not need bashing bears to put thoughts in my head with false statements.
5707 2018-07-27 02:01:33 There are many screening websites but I love to have my own data for each n every stock I trade & mainly Index Stocks.

5712 2018-07-27 01:59:54 "bum stocks"
5713 2018-07-27 01:59:41 We get this damn song and dance every time some financial advisor needs access to more money for them dump into stocks and bonds. And kids can earn their own money. Thanks
5714 2018-07-27 01:57:51 It's wrong to view stocks as just names. Always look at their underlying fundamentals and general sentiment towards the company and sector. Only then should you start trading the stock/warrant. These things matter.

5717 2018-07-27 01:56:33 Lol speaking of stocks. Look up the stock price of Warren Buffett’s company.  we are BROKEEEEE
5718 2018-07-27 01:56:17 Facebook stocks drops by 19%, loses $120 Billion in Value in one day making it the largest drop in the history.
5719 2018-07-27 01:55:00 Shout out to @JonathanHoenig...my favorite guest tonight...now I can talk about FANG stocks and not one member of my liberal crowd will have a clue as to what the heck I am talking about...
5720 2018-07-27 01:54:50 Whhyyyy did she give up!!!
5721 2018-07-27 01:53:11 What made them experts anyway? Do any of these so call experts are even in the field that are talking about? Even stock brokers aren’t right most of the in regards to stocks ! Let alone those looking and squawking from outside!
5722 2018-07-27 01:51:17 Curious what uranium stocks do you hold that are hedged
5723 2018-07-27 01:50:21 MI 6 tracking for 65million+ is a good  surprise. Should help Q3 earnings for $IMAX and $amc and maybe help these stocks out tomorrow or Monday.
5724 2018-07-27 01:48:50 But if she comes back, you think Tyler will try to convince Kaitlin it was him who voted to keep her? Despite what anyone else says...? Interesting!
5725 2018-07-27 01:48:18 Agree Doc antibiotic stocks very tough to play, market doesn’t see it as an hot sector.
5726 2018-07-27 01:47:58 Sadly no stocks...put all money into kids college degrees. I'm good though.
5727 2018-07-27 01:47:43 Hope none of y’all have Facebook stocks!
5728 2018-07-27 01:47:33 I want to do the same but I just can’t. I hate FB. 

But I did buy lots of pot stocks this week. And Netflix. So my moral outrage does seem to be somewhat flexible.
5729 2018-07-27 01:47:21 They were handing out money so cheap, big investors had the feds bankrolling their stocks. And they complain about trickle down economics?
5730 2018-07-27 01:47:20 $SPY for stocks. As a newer stock trader, I have learned quite a bit besides the book reading I have done.

5733 2018-07-27 01:44:35 If you have Facebook stocks! Sell.. Sell... Sell.. and then wait to buy again!
5734 2018-07-27 01:44:14 See real estate isn’t like stocks. If he had to sell stocks, it would simply be at a market rate and he would get fair value. If he were forced to sell all his real estate, there are not a bunch of buyers out there. Meaning they know it & price plummets as they know has to sell
5735 2018-07-27 01:43:14 Is there like a guide for this? I saw that PhillyD from YouTube also uses this app. I'm interested but have know nothing about stocks. And I even took a finance class 
5736 2018-07-27 01:42:19 To be quite frank, I used the search function before I asked you. I learned about Pettis by doing this, and I appreciated your convictions on other topics. I want to start from scratch and believed you could point me in the right direction.
5737 2018-07-27 01:42:07 ive come to learn exactly what you are saying.

I hold zero emotion while buying stocks now. 

Just trading vehicles.
5738 2018-07-27 01:41:56 @AskRobinhood it seems my Robinhood app must have glitched. One of my stocks says I have over a 100% loss, the majority of my shares disappeared. What can I do to get this fixed?
5739 2018-07-27 01:41:45 This aint stocks my G
5740 2018-07-27 01:40:47 Imagine a world where stocks, bonds, options, real estate- financial assets could NOT be liquidated to cash. One asset must be bartered for another (without tax consequence.)

Now that would be a lot of fun. We’d all be pro horse traders by the time we croak.
5741 2018-07-27 01:40:27 Great stuff.  When QE starts and everything is doing well, except the dollar, what happens next? How long will stocks push higher and precious metals?
5742 2018-07-27 01:40:02 Probably by next earnings.
5743 2018-07-27 01:38:15 Jesse Livermore was a prodigious trader & created rules for stocks we still use 100 yrs later. 

He was worth 1.3 billion after '29 market crash.

However he died broke & shot himself. He couldn't follow his own rules. In his note he called himself a failure.

Follow your rules.
5744 2018-07-27 01:36:54 Better have a tragic boating accident before they make bump and grind stocks illegal.
5745 2018-07-27 01:35:52 gonna be super egotistical for a moment because HOLY SHIT I JUST SUCCESSFULLY COSTUME DESIGNED THE BIGGEST SHOW OF THE SEASON AT ONE OF THE MOST WELL KNOWN SUMMER STOCKS IN THE COUNTRY.

All I need in this life is $500,000 
5748 2018-07-27 01:34:57 Yes and was reading about crack spreads which I don’t entirely understand but that favorable to all of these stocks
5749 2018-07-27 01:34:37 Hold on to them. There are so many lawsuits w/ crypto, but once they get settled it will go back up. It’s fun for sure, but it’s hard to predict crypto because it’s so volatile. That’s why most of my money is in stocks and bonds, but the returns on crypto can be so much greater
5750 2018-07-27 01:34:17 I’m not sure what the usual patterns are for stocks the day right after earnings reports. Do they often pullback from open?
5751 2018-07-27 01:33:01 Even if #gdp comes in high, wouldn’t it already be priced in to the stocks that have reported Q2? I don’t see companies that missed Q2 est earnings joining the party...
5752 2018-07-27 01:32:42 Nifty and sensex at life high but still most people will say there stock has not risen up, this will be the same scenario when nifty at 15000 And Sensex at 50000 
This is what’s the difference between buying cheap stock at cheap prices or buying value stocks at higher prices too

5761 2018-07-27 01:27:00 A good poker player does a better job of managing risk than most investors.

Would they go all in on every hand?

But you're doing that if all of your money is in mutual funds and stocks.

You wake up everyday praying today the market doesn't crash.

Why not fix that now?

5763 2018-07-27 01:26:13 Here’s the problem with buying social media stocks: young people bounce between them, and older people are abandoning them all together in favor of real, meaningful engagement - minus the anger.
5764 2018-07-27 01:25:24 @Zuckerbe, I can spare a few bucks if you need it. $15 Billion in one day? I know there is plenty more, but that has to hurt! #Facebookstock #Facebook #stocks #politics #ouch
5765 2018-07-27 01:22:29 Studying stocks that fall dramatically can increase your knowledge of what to look for when you buy a stock. Why did it fall? Sometimes the results are not what you expect. Have you seen what the insiders were doing before the fall? I seen selling.
5766 2018-07-27 01:21:27 Sell offs on blue chip stocks present new pullback buying opportunities.


Sell offs in forex mean economies are tanking or trumps been tweeting 

Sell offs in crypto mean...I don’t even know.  Does crypto even follow any rules 
5767 2018-07-27 01:19:03 Soooo frustrating!!!!! I am hoping Tyler and jc crack and slip up by saying something to that side of the house.
5768 2018-07-27 01:17:15 My experience with that is it’ll yield fine but the stocks will be weak. Get it out ASAP.
5769 2018-07-27 01:17:05 Previously i was fan of smallcase. But quarterly rebalance of 50% stocks is horrible thing. This is more for benefit of  broker rather investor
5770 2018-07-27 01:16:58 I think $IVZ Invesco is 1 of the biggest losers from the rise of Robinhood & their free trading app. ETF's R good @ saving U trading fees by just buying 1 ETF vs 50 different stocks but when U can buy 50 different stocks for free, there's no need for Invesco. Build your own ETF
5771 2018-07-27 01:16:54 Throwing your lot in with the Trumps at this moment is like betting heavy on bank stocks around Christmas 2007.

5781 2018-07-27 01:10:30 $FB's misstep could be another sign that the stock market is nearing the end of its rally. In a late cycle, you would typically see concerns about momentum stocks ie; thr popular technology names in that category

None of these obscenely wealthy spivs will pay a hundredth the price of the angry dupes who voted for them.
5803 2018-07-27 00:57:55 @tylerwinklevoss time to sue the SEC for rejecting the application for inadequate justifications.  Penny stocks are more risky and prone to manipulation and lack of liquidity.  Time to sue!

He was worth 1.3 billion after '29 market crash.

However he died broke & shot himself. He couldn't follow his own rules. In his note he called himself a failure.

Follow your rules.

5824 2018-07-27 00:46:25 I will! This is probably going to be my last season in street stocks because I am almost in C class and then I will race trucks for my man series.
5825 2018-07-27 00:46:12 Don’t get impatient if your stock price does not move for long time. Remember returns have always been lumpy. Stocks would rarely provide linear returns.

But key senior execs may start thinking about leaving since stocks in company are a major part of their benefits package.

I’m no expert just old and seen this before.

5853 2018-07-27 00:28:38 Very unfair Twitter, but you don’t give a damn anyway. 
You will care when your stocks drop drastically and you end up the way of the Dodo bird.
5854 2018-07-27 00:28:30 Well, he also made money testifying to senat doing nothing just preventing answering anything. It‘s all digital and just true if he sells his stocks so who cares?!
5855 2018-07-27 00:28:02 Your right, do your DD on whats hot or sour and follow them stocks news. Guaranteed on one will lead to another weak or strong as soon as news comes out (Like $INTC for me today). I've made money this way.

5868 2018-07-27 00:19:36 Nobody has explained why it CANNOT happen here.
35 year returns have always been excellent in the USA but the bull markets will end when we least expect it.
You’re right. I’m bearish so I only have 70% invested in stocks. I was 110% from 2010 to 2015.
5869 2018-07-27 00:19:30 Bravo on the picks. Hope you took profit in social media stocks. F roll of dice IMO but good DIVI if it don’t get cut. I sell mutuals (word of advice) I’m taking your money.
5870 2018-07-27 00:19:14 Nope, there aren't that many of you to do much damage. #BlueWaveBoycott & committing treason is what tanked Facebook. @CNN ratings went down b/c they covered tRUmp more than any other station & changed to a Jerry Springer type "news" format. I agree @Twitter stocks need to tank.

5875 2018-07-27 00:17:04 Hope that works out for you. Should have done that with my mining stocks the last few weeks, but hind sight is always 20/20. Will all come down to the oil price at this point. I'm never good at guessing short term movements. I'm going to hold here and look to BTD if we get one.

5877 2018-07-27 00:16:42 I love this. We would freeze our nematode stocks all the time (they'll still be alive), but idk if anyone knew *how long* they would actually last in the freezer (since they seemed to last "forever").

5892 2018-07-27 00:12:47 Sorry, I couldn't care less about Mark Zuckerberg. I never have and I don't own any stocks or bonds. I enjoy watching the Asian market live feed at night if I'm bored.
5893 2018-07-27 00:11:13 I see that you tweet about stocks too. Let me guess... long Tesla, FB, and HMNY?
5894 2018-07-27 00:10:00 Yeah, like I almost sold all my stocks last week watching CNBC.
5895 2018-07-27 00:09:55 #BTC and whole #Cryptocurrency market can be so easily manipulated. #CNBC wrote about #etf rejection... from last year. People did not read the article, just title. That's how crypto works. #FUD created by journalists or lobbyists or Soros. Pick one. #bitcoin #stocks

5901 2018-07-27 00:05:03 Some people do care. Facebook's crash today is the biggest one-day crash in it's entire history, and people have been panic selling Netflix and other tech stocks as well, not to mention Bitcoin
