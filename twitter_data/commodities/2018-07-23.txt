10 2018-07-23 22:27:28 I'm not even sure I estimate value that much anymore since I'm nearly always wrong about it. My focus these days is shifting to where I think tail risks are. I do those things first. Throughput comes much later if there are commodities to deliver.
11 2018-07-23 22:20:37 No, I do keep an eye on it and Asia when I wake as well as our futures, commodities, and currencies. It's as important as the news, if not more so. How long have you been trading?

15 2018-07-23 22:13:12 So would forcing them to have a similar minimum wage to the USA fix  the problem?  Seems like we're not competitive on manufacturing,  they steal intellectual property and where we are competitive like commodities were blocked/tariffed.
16 2018-07-23 22:10:11 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.” #tpesa
17 2018-07-23 22:03:15 And why should they lose their security clearances when they retire? Look at Jared Kushner, a more undeserving security cleared actor can not be found. I'd rather have proven commodities than Trump nepotism placed incompetent shills.

37 2018-07-23 21:55:17 He must remain FM till 2019.

Jaitley is a lawyer, likes complicated things for instance
 there r 4000+ Commodities such as sal tree leaves etc. under GST.
38 2018-07-23 21:46:42 Environmental activists claim oil-companies to reduce their businesses..but fail to convey  customers to reduce the consumption of oil-derived commodities, that theoretically both approaches will render same emission reduction.
39 2018-07-23 21:35:02 Super complicated question. In general, it's hard to imagine U.S. regulators being okay with prediction markets of any kind. Whether it's just a civil regulatory issue (e.g., violation of the Commodities Exchange Act) or criminal solicitation of murder is a whole different story.

41 2018-07-23 21:31:11 I refer you back to my Bretton Woods post.  Yes, commodities are priced in the largest and most freely traded and convertible currency.  With the US the single largest economy and now the largest producer of Oil it is likely to stay that way.  Iran is irrelevant to the US  in oil
42 2018-07-23 21:31:08 because we're not physically equal to men. if we were, 99% of rapists wouldn't be men. sports would not be segregated by sex.

since women are smaller, men through history have viewed women as commodities and attainments, bedding desirable women for competitive status.
43 2018-07-23 21:28:31 It's nice that you think you would permit other citizens to exercise their inalienable rights: that might show what you think is right. We probably disagree on the meaning and function of an "inalienable" right: I don't think they are commodities.
44 2018-07-23 21:27:30 As in economic textbooks: An economy where the dominant mode of distribution of commodities is direct exchange of commodities one for the other unmediated by any system of credit or money of account

46 2018-07-23 21:11:29 Kudos sir, but I think one of the lasting solutions is a functional rail system. If most of these commodities are transported by rail, of course our roads will be decongested.
47 2018-07-23 21:09:25 Women are not commodities. They are humans and equal to men. Whole India will support #NidaKhan in her holy war against the inhumane, barbaric and cruel practices of #TripleTalaq and #nikahhalala .
48 2018-07-23 21:02:15 I just saw an idiot claim that the fact that clearances are valuable commodities means it’s terrible of Trump to threaten stripping.
49 2018-07-23 20:56:46 If this article is written by any foreign writer, one needs facts checking and changing ground realities. People see basic commodities and essentials are out of range n they need change in two party system. 
If it is writtn by Pakistani writer u need to hire new.
50 2018-07-23 20:55:40 I realize that housing isn't treated the same way as other commodities are in our economy, but "to commodify" = "to turn into an object of trade" so I think it's fair to refer to housing as a commodity in that it's something that's bought and sold in our economy, no?
51 2018-07-23 20:49:12 nothing really bearish about either equities or the dollar, and nothing really bullish about commodities. Not sure why people are failing to see the obvious. I could be wrong but the facts are right there on the daily chart.
52 2018-07-23 20:41:01 Thank you Las, Wow I could have written that myself. Brilliant succinct summary. All I would add is that U3O8 is the odd ball among commodities in that demand is (almost) insensitive to price.U3O8 is a small part of fuel costs and fuel costs a small part of reactor operating cost
53 2018-07-23 20:40:01 They're too busy sitting libraries. 

If we can find a way to close the libraries the yachts will instantly be hot commodities and business will be great for the yacht builders and the jewellers.
54 2018-07-23 20:30:03 "please buy from littleblackcart" along with a number of other such journals which are all the same, like mass-produced commodities
55 2018-07-23 20:23:40 USD is backed by GDP of U.S and the rest of world who priced in USD, Like the commodities producing countries. Bitcoin is eventually backed by the value of crypto digital economy. without startups of altcoins, BTC is going no where.
56 2018-07-23 20:16:31 Have much more confidence in #CrudeOil E&P leading into Q2 earnings than I do with #gold #miners. The longer a #Commodities bull market takes to get going, the more I appreciate dividends. $XLE $XOP $XEG $GDX $GDXJ
57 2018-07-23 20:11:40 Sir we muat have large scope for dairy and juices. If young minds are guided well by KVIC and KVIB, i believe they will bring revolution. Exporting these commodities to their high will be a great start for our economy.
58 2018-07-23 20:10:40 No, I want commodities to remain commodities and public goods to remain public goods. You just want a slave caste society, we get it.
59 2018-07-23 20:02:38 Weekly Crop Progress Report:
Corn is 72% G/E, same as last week but G -1 and E +1
Beans are 70% G/E, +1 from last week (G -1, E +2)
60 2018-07-23 19:53:11 I'm suspect of most wage data... though "median" is a better metric than "average".

I know that chart that has been passed around in the past few weeks from the BLS should be full of ****s... as it rewards 2015-2016 data for the commodities crash.
61 2018-07-23 19:50:42 Not knowing much about either NYC ecosystem or about biotech, just wanted to say that skills that within a generation, skills that are scarce become abundant or even commodities
62 2018-07-23 19:38:03 Honesty and sincerity are rare commodities in today's society. If you have them, hang on tight. If you've lost them, seek them out.
63 2018-07-23 19:35:22 Dog whistle away to your heart`s content but I`ll say it again. People in Edinburgh differ culturally from people in Glasgow and have less in common with folk in Shetland. We are all more than commodities to be labelled Scottish/English/Welsh or Northern Irish to suit SNP agenda.
64 2018-07-23 19:31:44 Sell all stock in Brasso.. Stormy giving up a lot of shite.. Notify commodities market then cut production of brass poles by a third.. Screw #MAGA Hello Halo the #DNC only in Stop Biden.. Get Hillary .. a big support for #MaxineWaters #WSJ add @wlsam890
65 2018-07-23 19:26:00 Why is it bitter to want personal responsibility and individual accountability? I too have my debt paid off, and don't expect to be reimbursed if free public college is passed--but I still won't want to be forced to work to pay for someone else's commodities, especially bad ones.
66 2018-07-23 19:24:17 LMAO.... How much and where do we buy them? Since they're now commodities
67 2018-07-23 19:22:55 Most commodities markets, no?
68 2018-07-23 19:18:20 "only timid application of AD/CVD Law."

I believe the AD/CVD duties on Chinese steel and aluminum had already driven them out of the market.  From the USA point of view driving the Chinese to make fewer loss making investments in low margin commodities may not be best strategy.
69 2018-07-23 19:15:36 Coming soon, more hard-hitting Buzzfeed journalism:
"Why television is so visual."
"What makes commodities so commodified?"
"Startling research: Most find manual labor to be hard work!"
70 2018-07-23 19:01:25 GBGB self regulation is a failure.These dogs deserve protection,to be treated as sentient creatures rather than disposable commodities.
71 2018-07-23 18:57:16 Tariffs, he knew soybeans would be affected negatively, so why not short (bet that prices will drop) the market on soy bean commodities?
72 2018-07-23 18:51:02 Oh we've got lots of problems for sure (decaying urban infrastructure, public, consumer and corporate debt, rising education costs, undue reliance on commodities and manufacturing, fraying health and education systems, and of course inequality). /1

75 2018-07-23 18:46:36 Is there some other business you have in mind? Solar and batteries will be pure commodities. So what else?
76 2018-07-23 18:34:40 A) The imaginary world that lives in your head bears no resemblance to the real one. B) Commodities (oil) and manufacturing are the most valuable things in the world. C) Everyone works very hard, even drug addicts (of which there are few). Only a few old ppl on SS.
77 2018-07-23 18:32:28 Just remind them that the stock market, commodities and real estate values will crash and gasoline prices will soar. That will change their tune. @FoxBusiness @FoxNews @foxandfriends @cnbc @wsj @CNNMoney @rupertmurdoch are you listening?

80 2018-07-23 18:20:56 The fact carbon dioxide is running out so there's a shortage of soft drinks and also recently a shortage of whatever chicken modified plastic goes into KFC should make explicit the fact these capitalistic unhealthy commodities are unsustainable.
81 2018-07-23 18:18:43 The HFT War on commodities is real bro.
82 2018-07-23 18:17:22 The most dangerous words in investing (and especially in commodities) are "This time it's different". The graphite electrode cycle looks very strong currently, but investors sitting on hefty profits should now step up their due diligence and be more alert. All the best.

85 2018-07-23 17:53:07 That’s a truism and irrelevant. They are commodities and there is no long term point to car companies building their own
86 2018-07-23 17:49:15 I'd go with the other variables, since labour/regulation changes only occur periodically. Commodities fluctuate daily.
87 2018-07-23 17:46:22 Absolutely true ! But, such persons are now in the rarest of commodities category !!
88 2018-07-23 17:41:10 Well Jorge said you were wrong on commodities .. !

90 2018-07-23 17:33:26 Resource curse is the common phenomenon in which easy money from commodities  such as oil and gold leads governments to neglect other productive  parts of their economies - #joysms #joynews #citinewsroom @peacefmonline
91 2018-07-23 17:22:02 TRAIN LAW: Take-home pay will increase but prices of commodities and services will also increase. Gago lang di ba? Pero atleast, mas positive pa rin yung dating dahil depende na sa tao yun on how they spend their income. Wala lang, gusto ko lang i-explain yung relationship. Haha
92 2018-07-23 17:18:20 Absolutely no surprise here. Having lived in Kuwait for 2 years, racism was rife towards Filipinos, Indians and essentially anyone who isn’t Kuwaiti. Since the First Gulf War, a lot of Kuwaitis see having maids, drivers and nannies as essential ‘commodities’.

94 2018-07-23 17:16:45 Trump (unwittingly?) has started a sinofication of the U.S economy:
- Shifting to supply-side production (manufacturing, industrials, commodities)
- Boosting current account
- Gunning for 5+% GDP
- In return China's current account turns negative (which has happened in Q1)
95 2018-07-23 17:16:34 You mean a low output poor state. With lots of “disabled” on Social Security and lots of drug addicts. But not much valuable economic output, just cheap commodities & low value manufacturing 
96 2018-07-23 17:12:55 This officially makes the "Back to the Future" movie a little bit more like a reality. Futures,Commodities, get it?
97 2018-07-23 17:11:46 I am from Bengal at least I am happy about the prices of general commodities which are essential for living. BJP did not do any bad only problem is spiraling prices due to after effect of rising oil prices. If that can we controlled all will be happy
98 2018-07-23 17:08:43 what were *you* going to put that $495 towards?  granite countertops?  your coke habit?  commodities speculation?

you're a living, breathing externality, mate.
99 2018-07-23 17:08:11 Trendfollowing is US/Europe is a multi asset strategy. Commodities, currencies, bonds and equities. Called CTAs in US. Post 2013, returns have sucked because no long term trends. Also because of “crisis alpha” these strategies provided in 2008, too much liquidity flowed in.
100 2018-07-23 16:59:33 In next 5 years,Pakistan will see tremendous developments,lest wage per month would be $ 250, poor person will feel the developments,where people income increase and prices of commodities remains same,this is called development. Economics modern theories has explored many avenues
101 2018-07-23 16:56:14 You know whenever the prices of commodities goes up including fuel we the consumers are hurt most for our income doesn't change to match the variation making life very miserable for us. We appeal to the government to take this in account to bail her citizens from this mess.
102 2018-07-23 16:53:23 Unfortunately socialising usually requires three commodities that I am in short supply of time, money and willpower against my anxiety
103 2018-07-23 16:51:48 Kenya exports to India are largely primary commodities such as Soda ash, vegetables & tea.
104 2018-07-23 16:49:32 The transfer market IS a business & thus we talk about players as commodities, but it can get a bit ghastly when taken to extremes. Kellyn Acosta isn't a failure, as a person or as an FC Dallas prospect, because he's not Europe-bound by now. He asked for a change & FCD gave it.
105 2018-07-23 16:48:11 Una inversión . Parecida a los commodities tipo oro.
106 2018-07-23 16:47:38 Yes they aren't in the US you fucking dimwit, because the US exports it's poverty to places like India, where their commodities are made. Do you even know what Imperialism is? Or are you really just fucking braindead?
107 2018-07-23 16:40:30 2. For centuries, commerce in trees and slaves were the most lucrative commodities in the world.  Templars (Crusaders) went to north Africa to cut trees and then make slaves carry them to ships. They would then be shipped to India, England, Europe etc to build ships and castles.
108 2018-07-23 16:39:52 I believe it my dad worked 47 yrs for a company never thought to leave.  Now it seems like employees are commodities & employers are stepping stones.  Working near DC, I am very aware of how inefficient govts are, in particular the Fed. Costs at least 2x when they get involved.
109 2018-07-23 16:38:40 A solid economic plan  (#sustainable & geared to #SDGs) would be far more effective. We also need to realize pricing commodities too low is in no ones long term interests.
110 2018-07-23 16:37:02 And second, interrupting trade and making things domestically doesn't just mean more expensive labor. It means more expensive *everything* - commodities, specialized components, even logistics. Costs would go waaaaay up. There's a reason mfgrs went overseas in the first place.
111 2018-07-23 16:24:29 Why is #Oil getting hit today? Because it's Monday & that's part of the game plan of the Deep State's HFT War on commodities The victims are investors, farmers, oil producers, miners. You know the people who got @realDonaldTrump elected Stop the crime spree reinstate #UptickRule
112 2018-07-23 16:24:16 Christian evangelicals won't see anything wrong with this.  They think girls are commodities anyway.
113 2018-07-23 16:17:11 State's HFT War on commodities continues to rage.
114 2018-07-23 16:13:25 Yes. While it endangers #animals to give them away for free, breeding them merely for profit is worse. #animals shouldn’t be commodities. MILLIONS of pets are KILLED each yr, yet people continue to breed & sell them (my landlord has done it 3x in the 2yrs I’ve been here)

118 2018-07-23 16:03:03 Right but wages are not up. And most people are seeing a negligible increase in their take-home pay due to the “tax cut” that has been more than offset by increased prices of gas, dairy and other commodities. How much will farmers and manufacturing workers take before they turn?
119 2018-07-23 15:58:29 Yes and no. The market is the market. Doesn’t matter WHO the customer is, commodities prices trade in that scale. Countries blocking or jacking up artifcal tariffs have already skewed that. Thus locking out US producers already. Trump is trying to stop that. Work? 
120 2018-07-23 15:57:24 EM Asia, India, even Australia to some extent if commodities fall further.
121 2018-07-23 15:56:29 Then you say "were hated ,  we're treated as sub human". 
Humans aren't commodities,  yet you choose to consistently call yourself one cos it's convenient for your greed.

124 2018-07-23 15:42:45 I am not a great fan of charts either John...especially not when applied to Uranium stocks or commodities. prefer basics of supply and demand and the quirkiness of the Uranium market place. Spot price is all but irrelevant in my view...so thinly traded to be useful.

127 2018-07-23 15:35:38 If "free trade" means I will buy $50 billions worth of goods from you, but you will only buy $10 billions worth of goods from me, then it's a recipe for my extinction. Apart from certain raw commodities and trade with poor countries trade should be reciprocal

150 2018-07-23 14:16:25 But isn't the animals-as-commodities view inherent to the production and trade of animals? How can we place feeling, thinking creatures on a production line without treating them like products? How can we produce "livestock" without treating them like, well, stock?
151 2018-07-23 14:11:20 Cocoa powder, tea and coffee are also useful for trading.

And while we're at trading: alcohol, cigarettes, loo rolls, toothpaste and soap are particularly good commodities to have when money loses its value.

159 2018-07-23 13:45:12 The State is not smart enough to figure out that the cure for high oil prices is high oil prices. In their HFT War against commodities they have held most commodities below the cost of production with their HFT Price Controls. Now comes the pain.

164 2018-07-23 13:03:53 Futures & ETF work differently. ETF can only cause the market to go up. An ETF is usually built around a basket of shares, commodities or other.

212 2018-07-23 09:44:30 Very true, which is why capitalism isn't working.  Turning basic human needs, like Homes, into assets and commodities, breaks society and destroys communities.

226 2018-07-23 08:38:04 Goods are referred  to as verity of commodities  but Equipments   are referred as of technical nature
227 2018-07-23 08:26:06 Tommy, it is going to be a long and slow process; there is too much invested in the current system. It is going to be far more difficult than it should be because too much of our strategic resource is focused at commodities even if Ireland is too small to compete in such markets
228 2018-07-23 08:17:34 Dear @arunjaitley @irvpaswan
sir, you removed Many items from GST Lists and reduced many items's tax slab which is laudable.
But most of these will be beneficial to us; only when the price of commodities will be reduced And the comparative price will be shown by the companies.

232 2018-07-23 07:46:04 One of the cheapest to MAKE. But commodities are not sold based on the manufacture cost plus a reasonable profit. They are sold on what can be extracted from the customer. And as insulin saves lives...well..what price do YOU put on your life? A prime example of our fucked culture

242 2018-07-23 06:58:06 Not their fault they are safe commodities, both as brands and demographically. 

If they PERSONALLY elbowed out marginalised creatives then that's a different matter.

I'm 100% sure Jane has far better insight into this than I, so I'll leave any further commentary to her.
243 2018-07-23 06:49:30 GST slabs can be reduced to 3 in future: Sushil Modi : GST rates can be Zero for essential commodities i/c OTC medicines, 10% for all other items. Government should prune expenditure avenues in commensurate with reduction in revenue.
244 2018-07-23 06:41:39 The collected high taxes (TRAIN) helped the GDP grew.

254 2018-07-23 05:51:35 Over all scenario is that common people are worst affected by the wrong economic policies of PML N government during last 5 years. US$ 130, diesel 122, fertilizer prices 25% higher, farmers commodities price at its lowest, a big price hike & uncontrolled inflation coming!

266 2018-07-23 04:13:16 non-commodity forms do predate capitalism, confusingly even commodities exist here & there pre-capitalism. think you’re referring to the “30 golden years” which depended on higher profit rate due to the massive destruction of capital in ww2. don’t wanna repeat that really.

270 2018-07-23 03:21:57 Then again, price increase of soft commodities wouldn’t NECCESARILY result in higher inflation.. if it’s not really significant

278 2018-07-23 02:58:42 (and if it were up to me, I'd consider any commodities produced under a system where the vast majority of the laborers are not paid a living wage "unethical", not just the ones made by child laborers or in factories surrounded by suicide prevention nets)
279 2018-07-23 02:54:47 The younger generations should be encouraged to invest in the two scarcest commodities in their world. Themselves and Bitcoin. I think they'd be just fine doing so and the world would be a better place if they did.
280 2018-07-23 02:50:21 We know trump talks to his wealthy friends before causing market chaos.  I sincerely hope the SEC is watching for insider trading violations.  Whoever might've shorted soybeans, & other tariff affected commodities before announcements were made,  sure made a killing in futures.
281 2018-07-23 02:48:37 Most Filipinos suffer from the rising prices of basic commodities because of the TRAIN LAW. The government should address this because low wage earners are the ones greatly affected. Another problem is the rise in unemployment rate.

282 2018-07-23 02:47:51 Cater Page was a commodities broker in Russia who when the 2014 Sanctions began taking effect may have taken on the job of infiltrating the trump campaign to change the sanctions setting up the NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY PLATFORM in attempt to work away from the devastating sanctions !

293 2018-07-23 00:41:06 Yo estoy a favor de las retenciones, para que los alimentos y la energía sean accesibles a la población. No considero que sean commodities, tienen que servir para impulsar el desarrollo del país y generar las divisas necesarias. No hay otra alternativa
294 2018-07-23 00:26:56 I am speculating that Iran like DPRK has a robust sanction-busting program through front companies in UAE, etc. Iran’s economy is precarious and it is harder for the people due to currency devaluations. Russia would kick back goods, commodities, and gold mostly likely.
