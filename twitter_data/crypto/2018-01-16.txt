4 2018-01-16 23:59:53 昨日は、ホールドしてたリスクでBNBを買うという荒業した笑
5 2018-01-16 23:59:52 その戻らない日は、アーリーマジョリティ、レイトマジョリティまで浸透して仮想通貨一色になった後だと考えています。今はまだまだ普及段階なので先の話です。

7 2018-01-16 23:59:45 Unless you have a plan you’re looking to execute, don’t stare at charts and stress yourself out! BTFD! $crypto $btc
8 2018-01-16 23:59:40 Not that I'm trying to shit on bitcoin or crypto at all, but this bothers me as a statistician lol
9 2018-01-16 23:59:38 Can’t wait till my dad wakes up tmrw and watches the news and tells me “I told you this crypto shit is bullshit” Lol happens at every crash
10 2018-01-16 23:59:37 good decision

13 2018-01-16 23:59:29 It's freaking carnage in the crypto market. Bought some more XRP.
14 2018-01-16 23:59:29 @crypto_rand   I can't take you serious today bro stop fucking with me
15 2018-01-16 23:59:25 Even though this looks like nothing, it was something when it happened.
16 2018-01-16 23:59:25 I think its more likely because of the Chinese new year starting on 16th Feb. Millions are selling crypto profits to buy travel tickets. Biggest migration of people each year and years before. Buy on the dip now as bull runs are coming mid Feb!
17 2018-01-16 23:59:22 Nicest thing anyone’s ever done for me on crypto twitter! I’d ask u how the weather is in Canada but I already know it blows.

19 2018-01-16 23:59:19 That moment when most the world is trying to ditch their crypto and your friends are trying to figure out how to buy as much as possible. #msgthreads
