It was indicaitive that they then bought Randgold in this current dip.... at what I also think is rock bottom. Barrick knows gold.

15 2018-12-27 22:36:19 Chavez subsidized most commodities to win support of the masses, but that required oil tb be near $100. When oil prices fell no longer had money to subsidize but price controls (below cost of production) remained, so production ground to a halt

38 2018-12-27 21:56:23 I agree 100%. Known commodities are much better than unknown. How many first round picks have we swung and missed on? Good players require the use of that cap space everyone is so quick to speak about.
39 2018-12-27 21:55:22 Specifically T commodities?

41 2018-12-27 21:46:33 That’s where green subsidies come in surely, making these commodities competitive particularly during the transition away from chemicals
42 2018-12-27 21:42:31 Perhaps yes. We also shouldn't forget that most arable commodities operate in global markets that can be substituted with imports produced using the chemicals we ban. So increasing cost by removing the "insurance policy", which is the next step of many, is not the answer!

46 2018-12-27 21:32:47 Agreed; the fixed exchange system being attacked is the USD’s monopoly on commodities - there is an implied peg that is way overvaluing USD bc the amount of future USDs to be created vastly outstrip what the USD price of commodities implies.  This peg can be and is being attacked
47 2018-12-27 21:29:20 My own perspective? 

Trading at this point. Accumulating long term bags & buying commodities. 

Expecting top of next bullrun 2022-2023. 

Then divide in equity markets and/or real estate. 

Less trading/bigger timeframes. 

Starting my own charity. Giving back. 

You?

48 2018-12-27 21:16:46 Not bullish; more bullshit. Dollar softening, pensions desperately reallocating, key commodities still strong. And all the action is way late and stinks of BTFD. It's like all the momentum-hogs are self-harmonizing, packing into a wave of crowdthink as the day moves.

52 2018-12-27 21:06:40 A weak dollar  will mean a run for commodities real value
53 2018-12-27 21:04:57 The monetary system drives down prices of commodities. Taxes, labor law, regulations, compliance, zoning, licensure, subsidies, permitting, user fees, corrupt mass transit systems, etc drive up retail prices.

"Inflation" is a package-deal encompassing both monetary and fiscal

56 2018-12-27 20:59:46 It's a bit of a mix - there is still some tariff arbitrage, but also a lot of trade based on differences in subsidies, which a free trade zone would do nothing for. Not to mention trade in illicit commodities.

61 2018-12-27 20:38:04 You forced us to compare our resources to currency to win the game you created. We knew the true value of our commodities. We knew the value of an ear of corn wasn’t 1.25$ but that if you eat it, you’ll live until tomorrow. We were completely free. That’s what I want back.
62 2018-12-27 20:22:01 Sí, solo digo que no creo que el aumento de la pobreza y la desigualdad en México, retrocediendo a niveles de los años 90, tenga tanto que ver con la crisis del 2008 y el precio de los commodities. 

Pero es un debate muy interesante, ojalá opine alguien más que trabaje el tema.
63 2018-12-27 20:20:26 I believe he was speaking of Bitcoin as he mentioned commodities. But Brad Garlinghouse has stated time and time again that Ripple is a PAYMENTS company. Clearly #XRP is moving in that direction...
64 2018-12-27 20:19:45 Does anyone here actually think ML/AI are commodities? Service is important but most of this work is still handcrafted, artisanal stuff. Most companies have a long way to go in ML land.

69 2018-12-27 19:57:20 It’s as affordable as the political choice one wants to make ... housing as homes not commodities requires fair rents and will save money on other services when people have s chance to feel at home .
70 2018-12-27 19:55:34 Some of the comments reflect the prevailing view in England that houses are mere commodities not homes first & foremost.

84 2018-12-27 18:34:50 The reason carbon prices tripled in Europe is because investors started looking at it like a investment opportunity. Comparing it with other commodities supports this trend and its link to fundamentals is now tenuous.
85 2018-12-27 18:29:47 My bro-in-law (commodities trader) told me years ago that futures trading is not about supply & demand but about who has the most money to push around prices. Any trader of gold & silver has watched the US Treasury/Fed rig prices forever to protect USD. Cheap oil is the new ZIRP.

89 2018-12-27 18:08:38 There’s a difference between public goods and private commodities. California wants to tax text messaging...when they run out of money, they invent new taxes. Philadelphia has a soda tax. Social Sec started for only top1%, now it’s anyone with a job.

103 2018-12-27 17:02:01 Also assumes the only things traded are global commodities.  No distinctive or value added products. No complex supply chains.  No services.  It's hard to exaggerate what a streaming pile of... weak and superficial economic analysis... it is.

112 2018-12-27 16:17:45 Do you know why Zimbabwe we still having fuel queues ?? Do you know why Zim shops are pegging prizes of their commodities in three different currencies ?? These issues I know not America, Saudi Rebia.
113 2018-12-27 16:13:15 Sir any suggestion on how to trade commodities? Any learning video that one can go through ?
114 2018-12-27 16:09:47 I think IS-LAME is the most backward religion of the world. And somehow so stubborn and not so welcome to changes! Women are commodities, child factory for them. And hats off to their confidence in boasting such backwardness! #TripleTalaqbill
115 2018-12-27 16:07:21 For corporate reasons they will be ‘winning’ the champions league this season. Premier league not intrinsically linked to brand development this year - most major commodities (and by this I mean footballers) will be back and injury free by Feb at latest.

119 2018-12-27 15:51:49 I don’t want the fed messing with my retirement. Let’s let the economy set the interest rate. The Fed messes up too often. Our economy is growing and commodities are decreasing in price that is deflation not inflation.Reverse the interest rate hike! Stop trying to make Trump fail
120 2018-12-27 15:50:39 $EEUU  y $JAPON se ALINEARON c el resto del mundo. Lo importante es q  se  estabilicen los $Commodities $WTI en consecuencia del avance del  $ORO,  quien deberia potenciar su avance a partir d los 1284 ptos. q  ahora  tiene d resistencia.
121 2018-12-27 15:45:57 One thing though.... international commodities market stay open almost 22 hours. There is 7-8 hours of missed price action on MCX charts.
122 2018-12-27 15:45:11 Great landmark step towards actual ' Women Empowerment'.Shame on TMC,AIADMK & Congress,Owaisi others to pose hurdles that block this progressive bill.Shocking that these parties show such a mindset of looking at women as commodities without any dignity... #TripleTalaqBill
123 2018-12-27 15:39:30 Dear CHRISTIANS, FRIENDS are not cheap COMMODITIES and the term shouldn’t be used so LOOSELY. Just because they know your name and a few of your interests that doesn’t mean that you should trust them INTIMATELY. What’s MISSING is the SHARING…of lives. Marquis
124 2018-12-27 15:38:23 Private property typically means the means of production- factories, chemical plants, etc. that are required for generating commodities (tubes of toothpaste, computer chips, etc.) Personal property is typically smaller things like your spice rack or family heirlooms
125 2018-12-27 15:36:48 Ok..
Now for equities we have some bechmarks to watch like vix,OI,deliveries,trump tweets etc.
Do we have some specifics in case of commodities?
126 2018-12-27 15:35:50 Mas quando o PT implantou o socialismo q vc falou? Ao longo dos mandatos do governo Lula o crédito cresceu muito, empresas venderam a torto e a direito e os empresários lucraram. O PT fez as mudanças estruturantes que a economia precisava? Não, fez voo de galinha nas commodities.
127 2018-12-27 15:35:31 Not sure. I think with the economy levered to zero, and credit markets showing signs of strain, not sure how productive that would be. Market is clearly saying no. Not just stocks, but bonds and commodities as well.
128 2018-12-27 15:32:02 Yup. Women are not commodities
129 2018-12-27 15:30:21 What makes them think America is safer. It’s not- the insatiable demand exists for bodies as commodities.
 America is a RED danger zone for women and children. Predatory profiteering mass media logistics for the demand of sex trafficking supply chains. Follow the $

130 2018-12-27 15:24:38 Of course there will always be minimum wage jobs. Billionaire corporate CEO’s, who have convinced many gullible consumers that they’ll have to close fast food restaurants and retail stores if wages are increased, will artificially increase the price of their commodities.
131 2018-12-27 15:22:18 Las “soluciones”sugeridas son prórrogas de vencimientos, con  la zanahoria de tasas más elevadas (endeudamiento de un moribundo) esperando un milagro que no ocurrirá . La economía mundial se desacelera+aumento del proteccionismo+Fed subirá tasas= Caída de commodities y créditos
132 2018-12-27 15:18:33 Farmers? Think about 13000 #NSEL investors who were looted of Rs 12000 crores against commodity contract in #NSEL scan

The scamster is free and enjoying #Acchedin. nobody wants to invest in commodities now

No action by BJP
133 2018-12-27 15:17:20 BTPs higher “yay”
Tsys higher “yay” (free money)
Commodities lower “damn”
Chinese industrial profits worst for 3 years (and accused of being doctored) “double damn”
US consumer confidence massive drop “Powell’s fault”
134 2018-12-27 15:17:01 central bankers can use their money to buy real estate, precious metals, and other tangible commodities that retain value, before inflating the currency to a level that would destroy everyone else’s money-based wealth, impoverishing them.
135 2018-12-27 15:16:38 Así es. Hasta 1971 el país venía creciendo más que lo logrado en la dictadura. La diferencia fue en los años 90, en democracia, para estancarse tras la crisis asiática y hasta ahora, con fluctuaciones por precios de los commodities y sería todo.
136 2018-12-27 15:10:13 Bernie voted for the commodities modernization act.
137 2018-12-27 15:04:26  Everyone would be happy with that "fringe" benefit.
As a matter of fact, Zimbabwean economy and related liquidity crisis dictates that employees should be paid in commodities
138 2018-12-27 15:01:02 Help USA Citizens out.  Repeal Commodities Modernization act and force Speculator's to take delivery of the Commodities.
139 2018-12-27 14:58:39 Nice video about Oath protocol and how it brings commodities smart contracts on the blockchain. More progress for #OathProtocol
140 2018-12-27 14:40:21 We need more commodities that can be bought without extensive research into the personality of the vendor. We’re losing specialization. In some ways the medieval world feels more familiar today than the 1950s!
141 2018-12-27 14:33:08 Theres nothing more pathetic than to hear armchair political critics that haven't got a clue what the bigger picture and its considerations are from the lofty tower. Coffee boys attempting to decide what a Presidents lunch will be whilst not knowing what commodities are required.
142 2018-12-27 14:22:54 A lot of HOT AIR! Ah @weekasiongmp ,ah. Can you propose some solution as to how the PH government can mitigate the decline of world commodities prices incl oil. Was BN able to do this before? if you can, the world will kiss your feet and throw money at you. Then You can quit MCA
143 2018-12-27 14:17:02 Nobody knows what they are doing when they give up two young proven commodities in their prime for draft picks where they will try to find unproven young commodities that do the same thing.

Save money, yes; smart football decision, no.
144 2018-12-27 14:12:38 Apo your gvt is failing to do price control of basic commodities
145 2018-12-27 14:11:46 The 'jump, stop and reverse' that commodities did in 12m after QE2 was telling in that regard.
146 2018-12-27 14:11:23 She believes in the resiliency of humans and I think her personal experiences may have contributed to this? It also seems that she sees people as human beings and not commodities. It’s just refreshing. Also she is funny and we need laughs.

153 2018-12-27 13:54:22 Pointless to argue with a tattoo artist who has no trading experience at all. But with regards to the other, Tokens have not yet been classified as commodities. See Taxonomy Act. Even so, Insider Trading is still enforced by @CFTC (commodities)

158 2018-12-27 13:40:28 If the war on poverty had any validity there would be no class distinction and no 1% and everyone else. Further if people worship Jesus and not false Gods like money love would be the most coveted of commodities. This inherently would create a better world.
159 2018-12-27 13:25:58 E depois subiu vertiginosamente. Tem a destruição da ind brasileira, que hoje corresponde e uma parcela pequena do PIB, onde os gov petistas privilegiaram a importação de bens manufaturados e exportação de commodities. Desastroso pode não ter sido, mas ta longe de ter sido bom.

161 2018-12-27 13:22:00 OMG, Jim Paulsen is more volatile than the stock market. So now he is up with the following thesis:
- Inflation will come back (oil and commodities rally)
- That weakens the economy to 1.9%
AND THEN the FED pauses the rate hikes because the economy is weakening.

173 2018-12-27 12:07:34 Economy is “strong” only to those who wouldn’t even feel a darn thing if it was “weak”. To the rest of us, it’s just a myth. People can hardly afford vital commodities only to keep reading how “strong” the economy is. Economy was STRONG when @BillClinton was President! That’s how
174 2018-12-27 12:01:17 It is pure market demand what we sell our commodities at. Have you ever been one of 3 or 4 only producing a certain commodity? We can sometimes wait til we get price we want but we are not setting the price.

179 2018-12-27 11:22:03 Commodities aren’t usually a investment to gain but rather to hedge during bad times.
180 2018-12-27 11:14:49 A lot of it is underlying commodities prices are so much lower. Profit margins are there, but revenues will be going down.

186 2018-12-27 10:21:18 It would be useful if you gave some examples of commodities and respective price drops
187 2018-12-27 10:18:26 No! This is just one time solution. A number of steps and policies are needed. One of them being bridging the gap between buying and selling price of the buyer. The sale price of commodities by the farmers should be fixed at a reasonable rate keeping in mind the inflation
188 2018-12-27 10:12:08 Have been moving around most shops esp Pic n Pays, price of commodities are dropping.. Think retailers are now heeding President @edmnangagwa's call on charging normal prices which are affordable to consumers..

195 2018-12-27 09:12:51 There is no such thing as "happy" meat, dairy or eggs, because happiness belongs to living, sentient beings, not to corpses or products. Bodies are not commodities, and no one should be treated as property.

227 2018-12-27 04:58:31 Falta harto, estamos lejos de los commodities en todo sentido: subsidios, volumen, redes, pitutos, etc, etc. Aparte que es mucho más fácil venderlos. Imagina a esta cabrita tratando de vender software,  hacer demos, PoC, etc. Mejor darle a la fruta

230 2018-12-27 04:23:45 Saw "Trading Places" over Christmas for 10th time or so .... always forget to ask the Universe  ... why did they film and base an obvious Chicago-based commodities trading movie on the old Philadelphia Exchange PHLX?
231 2018-12-27 04:04:48 Honourable sir, i view these things more from a spiritual angle. That guy needs a better life, cheaper fuel cost, cheaper price of all commodities, but they need deliverance to let go of the Buhari chain around their necks.
232 2018-12-27 03:57:52 This life shit is way deeper than realized. Most people are distracted by daily commodities they can’t see what’s happening in plain SIGHT
233 2018-12-27 03:54:52 @eikebatista No Poder 360 , para o coordenador de análise do CEBC (Conselho Empresarial Brasil-China),  o interesse da China pela area de infraestrutura no Brasil  tem como pano de fundo a estratégia de garantir o abastecimento de commodities para a expansão da economia chinesa
234 2018-12-27 03:51:22 Nobody could be more responsible for the mess. He voted for Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96, NAFTA, and wrote the most draconian crime bill in this countries history.

236 2018-12-27 03:21:17 I’m just glad the stock market isn’t my day job any more.  IMO, ag commodities are much more rational by comparison.
237 2018-12-27 03:19:19 Stock market : the economy :: weather : climate.

That said, it certainly feels like we’ll be entering a recession in 2019. Trump’s trade war is killing commodities; I see it firsthand in the construction biz.
238 2018-12-27 03:06:07 Great achievements. But prices of commodities did not come down, despite reductions in tax rates. There is no control over price rise. Multinationals are creating havocs. Eating the resources of the country. Do some small CSR and raise prices every two months. No  checks on them.
239 2018-12-27 02:58:07 He said commodities but this is are  services still will reply .#1 Health care become costly everyday but for Poor's we have ayushman scheme now. #2 School fees now in Noida big school has adjusted RS 6 cr hiked fees after state gov order .#3 Rent : it was never in gov control

241 2018-12-27 02:44:19 Otra que "el K desperdició el boom de los commodities": manejaron el modelo agroexportador como quisieron, hacían tomala vos damela a mí con la presidencia como en un club, etc. Hasta 1930. El famoso 7mo PBI del mundo hiperconcentrado y no dejaron UNA base a futuro.
242 2018-12-27 02:39:28 American web sites are blocked because they are selling your privacy. In the US you and your privacy are commodities to be bought & sold.
243 2018-12-27 02:24:15 ...markets in heat/cooling, power, mobility etc as energy services rather than the insanity of treating electrons as energy commodities tradable for the profit of rent-seekers
244 2018-12-27 02:23:08 Just as an FYI, those no one follows the cash markets in China, they have daily trading volume about 8x the stock market and are probably the best indicator of any asset flows in China from commodities, stocks, and real estate. So yes, them jumping to 9% is important
245 2018-12-27 02:13:24 China will impose a temporary import tax rate on more than 700 commodities. Since 1st January  2019, no export tariffs will be imposed on 94 commodities such as fertilizer, apatite, iron ore, slag, coal tar and wood pulp.

247 2018-12-27 02:08:56 To signal to the donors they will vote on right wing legislation if dems regain control. That's how we get Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96 NAFTA CTPA fast track TPP the Iraq war and Larry Summers and Victoria Nuland confirmed
248 2018-12-27 02:01:18 $2.99 here in AZ. Trump must love GA more...because , you know,  he controls the prices of commodities. All hail Trump! He will bring in the greatest wheat harvests we have ever seen! All hail Dear Leader!
249 2018-12-27 01:58:51 Ask Jeff how his long commodities position worked out this year, lol. He's clueless just like everyone else playing the game. No one has any idea where prices are headed because a significant component of price (PE expansion/contraction) is almost entirely emotionally driven.
250 2018-12-27 01:57:06 no saber de acciones, commodities, fx, indicadores, etc no es un pecado. El problema está en no saber, hablar de ellos y promover la ignorancia. Ahora súmele que quien no entiende nada de lo anterior es un economista y quería ser presidente.
251 2018-12-27 01:50:18 Commodities?
252 2018-12-27 01:47:35 Commodities prices as of now: 

Spot Gold: 1,273.80
LME Nickel: 10,770.00
Copper: 2.704
Brent Oil: 54.22

USDPHP: 52.80
253 2018-12-27 01:47:26 Farmers are selling commodities. When buying inputs we're retail buyers, never large enough to affect pricing. Retail pricing in a low competition market is all about charging what the market can bear. If there's people willing to pay that price, they will sell it for that price.
254 2018-12-27 01:39:31 Gosh, could the cult of equity be finally over ????

Bodes well for commodities.

However, still on the lookout for new highs in equity indexes for now.

The big dump could be some  years away but it will happen for sure: sovereign bond market defaults will be fun.

256 2018-12-27 01:34:36 Eu n disse em nenhum momento q n teve, mas p/ mim é claro a falta d honestidade de quem fez, no momento q eles n fizeram tudo q poderiam por preferir corrupção do q fazer historia pelo povo. E é fato da bonanza do gov Lula ter sido baseado em commodities, estavam de cara p/ o gol
257 2018-12-27 01:31:05 La pregunta es: cuántos (as) en Chile sabrán que un pais no productor de hidrocarburos no tiene injerencia alguna en los valores en que se transan estos commodities?. Entonces, la ese tuit va a dirigido a ese elector no instruido

264 2018-12-27 01:08:38 Derivatives market, Commodities market, Visa, Mastercard, Amazon, SBI, Central Banks and many others institutions are waiting Cobalt to go live, because Cobalt will make xRapid to handle at least 50k transactions per second.
Cobalt will make XRP to go to the moon with xRapid.
265 2018-12-27 01:07:04 Understand your point but disagree with the premise. The world doesn’t run on money, modern society does.  Money is a construct created within a  construct. Spiritual gifts are not equatable to commodities, but we still gotta eat.
266 2018-12-27 00:59:48 Yes I always have shorts against my long book. Vol is very event driven.. No commodities except for event risk or macro since I don't understand them very well (and hence no edge)
267 2018-12-27 00:52:01 Share what you’re willing but do you short also or play vol/commodities etc
268 2018-12-27 00:31:52 hey trolls..Soybeans were $9 in 2015 and $9 today. Soybean and other commodities are have NORMAL price fluctuations... Trump's Tariff war with China is working just fine.  Gas is as cheap as it's been in 10 years..  Trump's America is doing great! MAGA!  More Fake News From NBC!
269 2018-12-27 00:29:39 Siempre y cuando no explote la burbuja financiera mundial, no caigan commodities, etc, etc. En ese caso lo peor está mas cerca.
270 2018-12-27 00:28:13 Also I just realized that Mariah Carey has a lifetime source of income because of her song. What even is investing in commodities/real estate
271 2018-12-27 00:11:04 A guy NYC with all the commodities in the world talking shit about bad parenting. Poor judgement yes.  Screw your wall.
272 2018-12-27 00:06:53 Yes very true and very bullish for commodities if big enough
273 2018-12-27 00:06:09 Absolutely on target as Globalisation had given benefit to only few nations and ruined many.Economy fallen and increased corruption.Prices of essential commodities increased and you can see the where petrol and gold reached without any advantage to 90% of people.
274 2018-12-27 00:00:24 All about getting rid of worthless dollars for real assets and commodities.  "Oh you have USD debt that you're having trouble with? I can help you out with that. Just sign this mortgage"
