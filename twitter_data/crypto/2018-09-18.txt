167 2018-09-18 23:34:04 Nobody is going to 'win' from all this Craig.. fiat and government regulation is our enemy.. not each other.

168 2018-09-18 23:33:46 Well it’s really hard to satisfy everyone and would love to make one for everybody but it’s extremely time consuming so I accepted two offers for crypto to make personal ones and add them to the mural if you really want to consider it.

245 2018-09-18 23:22:25 I basically agree, not something to brag about, especially by crypto leaders. However, until crypto is widely accepted by merchants it solves a practical problem, and may help incentivize normies to onboard during transition period. Maybe?
246 2018-09-18 23:22:24 The longer I’m in crypto the more I realize just how early it is. To suggest speed & low fees will not drive mass adoption is akin to making crop predictions with comet sightings in the 1400’s

- stellar platform is cutting edge fintech platform that could have some use for or demand. It's a neat crypto-authentified distributed ledger.
- benefits are: open-source code, built in PKI (crypto), compatibility (shared backed-end), free to use, programmable

294 2018-09-18 23:16:08 I don't think the labels help, given this is a new base economic technology that could be used in all manner of ways.

It would be accurate to state that bitcoin, & thus the vast majority of existing crypto started in this way, but alternatives cryptos are possible, too.

335 2018-09-18 23:06:36 That risk is exactly why all crypto matters. The fact remains decentralized p2p currency exists. There is technically no longer a monopoly but if only a few % own and use it theres no macro effect. As an alternative crypto is inevitable so just a matter of speed/time
336 2018-09-18 23:06:33 Thank you for writing it. Helped me when I first got into Crypto to understand more about what the technology is capable of.

420 2018-09-18 22:49:55 Surely the vast majority of retail buyers hold their crypto on exchanges.
421 2018-09-18 22:49:47 Crypto is a Ponzi scheme, people still have access to it. It is a private good but can be manipulated irrationally either by pump and dumps or hacking into the mainframe and changing its applicable trajectory their is no tribunal unilateral court to have a conclusive decision.

424 2018-09-18 22:48:50 Hot take: US can’t allow themselves to be seen straight up buying crypto without damaging appearance of dollar hegemony. Their plan is to steal enough crypto from other people under guise of national security to shield themselves from coming world financial collapse

Short $1.31748

Why? 

1) Overall bearish outlook on Cable

2) This latest push up feels like a liquidity reach for some equal highs formed back in July and todays previous high
434 2018-09-18 22:47:40 If Bitcoin is truly destroying the economy, there should be plenty of damning evidence for it, but no one wants to evaluate the power consumption that Bitcoin and other crypto markets try to replace.

There are quite a few with very little impact, but using bitcoin as a talking point here, why trash it without legitimate comparisons?

457 2018-09-18 22:43:15 People leak money. They enroll in gyms they never use, buy $3 Starbucks daily, order dilveroo/take away for dinner, throw cash at crypto, buy fast fashion, don’t pack lunches, taxi more often (thanks to mytaxi). I’m not saying they can’t do this but there are side-effects.

553 2018-09-18 22:29:11 That’s great if you can do it. Personally I think it’s less stress to have a job than try to make all your living in crypto.
554 2018-09-18 22:29:00 Dude from work told me to get into Crypto and buy xrp. So

I did

556 2018-09-18 22:28:54 Reminds me of crypto idiots and their conspiracies about banks/governments trying to take down their decentralized network cuz it is a threat to them. While most ICO are scams and tether is a central bank...
557 2018-09-18 22:28:51 That's hardly a good reason to engage in that type of behavior, I doubt you would even respect me in the morning

560 2018-09-18 22:28:34 So... if the total crypto market cap hits 20 trillion USD as @yoshitaka_kitao predicted and $XRP becomes #1 then it will surely have a market cap of at least 30% of the total --> 6 trillion
That means XRP will be worth around $150

561 2018-09-18 22:28:34 .@MSNBC What are you thinking? Danielle Pletka is as deplorable as they come  — a liar & crypto Supremacist. She’s divisive for its own sake, and she has nothing to add to the discussion abt #Kavanaugh or sexual harassment. RU just desperate to have a woman talk smack abt women?
562 2018-09-18 22:28:01 Bitcoin is not going to be the crypto for the everyday man. Let’s be clear on that. You’re deluded if you think otherwise.
563 2018-09-18 22:27:44 This also is why I really am not a fan of crypto currency and I really hope it all goes pop soon.
564 2018-09-18 22:27:41 What is going to be very interesting to watch is if the crypto space will stand up to security laws, causing them to change, especially the accreditation laws, or they will just act like sheep and let the government do whatever it wants and take control of the market?

594 2018-09-18 22:22:51 Cmon buddy. Baakt opens in November, remember?
595 2018-09-18 22:22:37 There are hundreds of coins up more than XRP is, its just crypto dude not everything is some tin foil hat shit.
596 2018-09-18 22:22:36 I'm trying to keep my expectations low but the next week or so seems to have a lot of news with chainlink potentially a part of it.
597 2018-09-18 22:22:12 Ya that pump in the morning got me tripping too, heard it was news with ripple why it pumped. Blame ripple for the shot up we had today but I had everything going back down. So being extra cautious right now
598 2018-09-18 22:22:11 Yes. My point is that they made the gautrain first then developed payment method to support it.

Here it seems they have a payment method and are trying to make a transit method for it. Kuvacash seems like a small crypto company.
599 2018-09-18 22:22:10 On a des belles divergences haussières cachées sur le RSI en Daily et Weekly sur le $ETHBTC $LTCBTC $BCHBTC. Le Top10 crypto pourraient suivre le $XRPBTC dans les prochains jours/semaines. A surveiller. 
600 2018-09-18 22:22:02 Remarkable the way it keeps repeatedly bouncing at $6k while every other crypto has long since collapsed to new ytd lows. Certainly nothing to do with price manipulation and being Tether'ed to a support level! Pardon the sarcasm

604 2018-09-18 22:21:15 Because you could never grow until you get hit by something unknown. Growth requires the unknown because if it was known, then it already happened.
605 2018-09-18 22:21:13 Most exchanges say they trade on their own platform
606 2018-09-18 22:21:03 I believe that in this scenario, it’s best to keep friends close and enemies closer. Crypto’s enemy number one is the financial institutions that rule the world and control governments decisions. We have many wars to go before Crypto wins over Federal Reserve
607 2018-09-18 22:21:01 No.

The concept of crypto is cumbersome and scales negatively.

609 2018-09-18 22:20:09 I don't think so. They might go up in value, but won't have moon potential. So yes they can make money for conservative investors, but we know alot of cryptoheads want moonshots so I see them not being as interested. It's like boomer crypto. Plus securities laws are a joke

630 2018-09-18 22:16:59 Carter, your long-term macro prospective on markets is both sobering and exciting. I think most people in crypto are married to one asset class, but savvy investors should remain dynamic, moving one to another as the market reveals itself.

655 2018-09-18 22:12:09 Yup. I agree...I'd like to add that the timing/emergence of crypto currency began under this current administration. (which collects driver license, social security, and began in R and NK). Its true intent links up multiple computers to create supercomputers.
656 2018-09-18 22:12:05 Is that the same face as, “xrp is going to be listed on coinbase tomorrow”?
657 2018-09-18 22:11:36 Yep, but I think that aliens that live on earth are able to use the XRP technology to fund their operations from home, so they will definitely help us grow and beat those families who are manipulating crypto! True story

My guess would be that most retail investors have their gambling money in crypto. Gambling money is the first to go in a downturn.
686 2018-09-18 22:06:41 Crypto will have its washout and trade below the cost of production but that time isn't now. Crypto needs millions of new investors before that happens.

The washout will eliminate 95% of altcoins just like any other industry's washout
687 2018-09-18 22:06:09 There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving

689 2018-09-18 22:05:54 Seriously, this reminds of the famous (amongst crypto people) story of where the term “Hodl” came from. Google it, it’s so awesome and so classic. I believe that Clam Down has the same type of potential. God Speed @Twentyrings this might make you a legend.
690 2018-09-18 22:05:54 Maybe the social tension in crypto is caused by too many George R R Martin fans.  They think the only way this ends is every coin dying.
691 2018-09-18 22:05:53 Everything looking good so far bro. Back in the game

714 2018-09-18 22:00:44 So many #cryptotwitter claim to be

753 2018-09-18 21:54:43 Does that mean when I'm buying I'm actually a bear because I want people to sell to me?
754 2018-09-18 21:54:33 Or you want people to buy so that they can fill your bids?
755 2018-09-18 21:54:31 awwwww the feeling is mutual!!!! 
756 2018-09-18 21:54:29 I admit i thought the same at first, but when you get used to it you’ll feel somehow connected to a meta-physical entity that just wants to know about you. I don’t really know tho it could easily just be the grappas I drinked earlier to speak, you better ask him. lol

775 2018-09-18 21:51:24 "Just burn crypto down and start over."

I think that's basically what's going to happen.
776 2018-09-18 21:51:12 But a lot of people treat crypto like religion. They have blind faith!! I don’t agree with a lot of things that they or anyone else believes. But I accept that they are entitled to whatever they want to believe. I respect that
777 2018-09-18 21:51:00 Been looking into @PaycentGlobal, interesting that they are partnered with Union Pay and have already shipped their cards when other big ICO projects STILL haven't shipped their cards yet.

783 2018-09-18 21:49:25 You think it’s just about “helping” people and ignore or disregard the negative aspects.
784 2018-09-18 21:49:24 Yeah more than xcurrent the “strategy” is to get contracts with the banks and then sell them on Xrapid... the theory is that once crypto cowboy days are done... then it won’t be a hard sell... this is just what I gathered over time from reading... but def can research more

808 2018-09-18 21:46:31 The nature of BTC is blockchain. That hasn't changed. The specific implementation of how that blockchain was executed changed and updated even when Satoshi was still around. Admittedly, Satoshi wasn't an outstanding programmer...

826 2018-09-18 21:44:16 Crypto is a colossal waste of precious energy that could be used for more important things.

It also only benifits cyber-feudalists who got into the game early and everyone else who are follwing them are just buying into a ponzi scheme
827 2018-09-18 21:44:12 I’m #bearish on humans and idgaf who knows. Not sure if that makes me look an  or if people appreciate my honesty. Maybe I’m an honest  
828 2018-09-18 21:44:06 Well $icx first product is a Dex. It's important not to look at how things work now and try and see what the future vision is. If/when crypto is adopted by mainstream most people will me exchanging tokens from within their wallet. Right now price is just speculative.
829 2018-09-18 21:43:51 I'm going to express my own experience. Crypto currency is a NK and R cyber attack on the American people. It's been hacked numerous time for hundreds of millions. They ask for drivers license, ssn, etc. Its only allowed prob bc Trumpet allowed it.

833 2018-09-18 21:43:28 Ironically tho... 
those are reasons why there should be an ETF.. 
ETF is better for grandma, than a sketchy exchange.

836 2018-09-18 21:43:09 Thought you weren’t a crypto guy @PFTCommenter
837 2018-09-18 21:43:06 Because of that, it is increasingly hard for me to come up with the crypto or fiat just to trade, let alone invest in amazing bot tech like the HaasBot.

This is the reason that I not only need a win like this but would be forever grateful for it.
This could be the break I need!
838 2018-09-18 21:42:43 Just solved the mysteries of @cog1347 !!  with @bbuerhaus @jtobcat @_ARGSS_ We had lots of fun with it!  Thanks for the crypto kitties @neondistrictRPG @coin_artist - they've been adopted to good homes.

852 2018-09-18 21:40:45 Getting people into shitcoins like $DIG without knowing shit about TA and without understanding why BTC is different from shitcoins is one of the most irresponsible acts in the history of crypto. @ToneVays doesn't gamble TA like you gamble FA. Learn than talk.
853 2018-09-18 21:40:44 Unpopular opinion: every large crypto twitter account is run by Satoshi, pumping his bag until he is the richest man in the world.
854 2018-09-18 21:40:39 Why is that possible to give such brilliant ICO-project? These guys have done their ICO with a soul. It will be a long time till I can find something as cool as this. Be wise and check this #faceforward #Alfaenzo #blockchain #ICO #crypto
855 2018-09-18 21:40:15 I have struggled to keep up with learning the constantly changing market and it has been very difficult for me to make back what I had.
I am passionate about crypto but fairly poor compared to most fellow enthusiasts I have had the opportunity to meet.

863 2018-09-18 21:38:05 Buying a crypto no one has ever heard of as insurance doesn’t make any sense
864 2018-09-18 21:38:03 @coinnup On the #Paymaz exchange, users can buy not only BTC and ETH but a range of popular altcoins without first buying BTC and ETH and then using them to buy altcoins.

866 2018-09-18 21:37:59 Read the pinned post.
867 2018-09-18 21:37:55 I love sarcasm. Some of us have mastered it and it should be appreciated 
868 2018-09-18 21:37:48 Lol nice sarcasm Crypto, I needed the laugh 
869 2018-09-18 21:37:46 Glad to have you on board.
870 2018-09-18 21:37:42 I found the haasbot a couple months ago while searching for leverage bots. Initially I was absolutely blown away by the tech and have wanted to use it from that moment forward.
I was given a short trial that I was unable to use because an emergency at home left me without crypto.
871 2018-09-18 21:37:20 White paper will tell us about all the subtleties of the project. I hope you are interested in this project. #crypto #oppopenwifi

873 2018-09-18 21:36:53 Here's an unpopular opinion for you: If you think $crypto will replace the $USD you have a very little brain with a lot of dead cells.
874 2018-09-18 21:36:48 Seriously tho, if you’re cool with publicly humiliating someone or hurting their feelings then why not publicly apologize? Sure, it might sting a little but it also stung the person you hurt. And I bet you’d think twice before doing it again. Not you specifically, js.
875 2018-09-18 21:36:44 No doubt! Get on it!

890 2018-09-18 21:35:01 I’ve been in crypto since 2015 & didn’t get onto twitter until 2017. I didnt mean that at all. I mean when someone new to both twitter and crypto voices an opinion it can be met with a more realistic voice from a more experienced person and that is usually to manage expectations.
891 2018-09-18 21:35:00 Not only does the new Iron Man movies mimic the life of Elon Musk, Tony Stark's house in Iron Man 2 was actually filmed at SpaceX.

898 2018-09-18 21:33:31 #bitcoin is seen by many as the de-facto currency, many do not realize that it was only a prototype poc that then became widely adopted. This is a pathology that often occurs in projects with prototypes having to go through successive sticking plaster solutions. @alfrednoble2
899 2018-09-18 21:33:26 Understanding #Crypto and $btc, the worst thing we could have done was allow for futures trading. It opens the door for more manipulation. #imo
900 2018-09-18 21:33:19 Market cap alone is inadequate indicator of crypto adoption as corrupt central banks could create their own private blockchain & pump it with endless fake monopoly money inflationary fiat as appears to be their plan hence the current apparent manipulation stalling of #Bitcoin

902 2018-09-18 21:32:33 See, good, encourage people, that's fine. It's risky. People in Crypto know that.

937 2018-09-18 21:27:30 There is a lot to be found on twitter i learned. I prefer to just slurp up my coffee, watch a documentary and will see what tomorrow brings.  Crypto is too overspeculated to say anything sense-making about whats going to happen.

954 2018-09-18 21:25:12 4to1 MAYBE...If banks crash  AND the only crypto used for peer to peer was litecoin.  LTC is competing with SOOOO many others like BCH, Dash,NEM, Bytecoin just in the top 25. PLUS all the privacy coins. I would settle for 50-1 SERIOUSLY!

957 2018-09-18 21:24:37 Failures of the Astrological Crypto model:
#1 We totally missed the late April/early May rally
#2 We called for a big mid May rally never happened, prices actually declined, so we missed selling the April rally that did happen.

959 2018-09-18 21:24:26 Sounds expensive I’m still on the cheap stuff Shiraz 
960 2018-09-18 21:24:16 do you want the state to regulate crypto?
961 2018-09-18 21:24:06 Substitute Silicon Valley or Stanford for YC and statement still holds. YC has gone down the ICO, Ethereum rabbit hole in crypto and subject to same political correctness and groupthink as the rest of the Valley.
962 2018-09-18 21:24:03 It's really simple, without institutional investors this lot will have no one to dump on. The whole crypto community should come together and ignore any project with has their involvement.
963 2018-09-18 21:23:32 sounds like a perpetual circle jerk.  Commercials are nothing without us.  Ignore them and their fiat instrument of slavery.

973 2018-09-18 21:20:58 Kucoin doesn’t appear on tradingview so can’t be used with the script. Try back testing the 5$15MA cross. You’ll find it isn’t great for choppy markets but would have saved some bit drawdowns when we crashed.

'Cause I have a whitepaper here, that I would like to send you the link for you to read & decide if you want to become an adviser to the project.

977 2018-09-18 21:20:21 Great idea
978 2018-09-18 21:19:51 Crypto can’t really be predicted but the quality of the project,circulating supply and total supply really matters,at the same time dont use ATH to buy a coin,some will never be the same again.
979 2018-09-18 21:19:50 $OCN I held for the air drop, $SPHTX was locked up due to mainnet launch. I then flipped the rest. I used the 5&15 MA cross on the Kucoin charts to flip. I just did it manually. My man @allstarandy85 has a great T3MA script I’ve used a bit, but only works on tradingview.

1014 2018-09-18 21:13:23 After speaking with multiple BTC whales who trade OTC, is shocking the amount of money being invested. Cryptocurrency like it or not, has become its own asset class.

1048 2018-09-18 21:07:37 Well, not all females. My 1st gaming system was Atari & I got my first computer at the age of 12. I was a gamer & tech nerd long before crypto entered the scene. Not all women are created equal. I’m not into clothes, makeup, & shoes. I’m into books, machines, space, & business.
1049 2018-09-18 21:07:27 Lots of scams and frauds are hiding under the the hype of crypto innovation & blockchain but they are just HYIP, Pyramid & Ponzis. The SEC of US has actually indicted quite alot. Its a wild west.

1060 2018-09-18 21:04:23 But that's just it for me. So they buy actual $BTC increase the demand and price goes up. They sell their version of it but they are backing it with their own money. Even if they cash out their $BTC price drops but they are the ones tanking more so.

1082 2018-09-18 21:01:21 McDonald’s will probably be the last big company to adopt crypto. Their POS system is basically still from the 80ies and their global IT sucks.
1083 2018-09-18 21:01:11 Welcome to every crypto “article” ever written by a “journalist” ever
1084 2018-09-18 21:01:00 New York believes it has authority over exchanges across the planet. How quaint!
1085 2018-09-18 21:00:42 Repeat for crypto now

1090 2018-09-18 21:00:22 I think that the idea behind @tapofficial1 to try to simplify how people are dealing with the many exchanges in the industry if they can support enough of the crypto space it could be amazing #finance. #tapofficial1 #Blockchain. #Crypto #CryptoCurrency #trading

1100 2018-09-18 20:58:51 Sometimes I get frustrated at the fact I’m not where I want to be financially. Realistically it’s not going to be quick and I need to ask myself if I’ve made progress towards my goals. If the answer is yes then all is good.

1103 2018-09-18 20:58:17 Great news for the crypto market! Morgan Stanley is reportedly preparing to offer bitcoin swap trading… but cryptocurrency it’s not only bitcoin! What if you can trade 10 cryptocurrencies at once? Or even 20? #MPCXP #Ai #Blockchain #Crypto
1104 2018-09-18 20:58:09 Since hardly anyone accepts litecoin or crypto how will this be possible?
1105 2018-09-18 20:58:08 agreed!!
1106 2018-09-18 20:58:08 If you want to change the whitepaper, then create your own whitepaper & compete as an altcoin. The Bitcoin whitepaper was set in stone to define Bitcoin. Changing fundamentals from whitepaper alters economics of system & game theoretic structure making it no longer Bitcoin.
1107 2018-09-18 20:57:53 Anything under $10 is a deal, anything under $50 is fair. It goes beyond any other crypto use case and will increase in value no matter what. Never stop accumulating dude!
1108 2018-09-18 20:57:48 and haven is both lowcap and could use some publicity.

1112 2018-09-18 20:56:33 Some view crypto as a means to make a quick buck, I see it as a small step to decentralize currency and to bring control of real purchasing power back to the people. #cryptocurrency #BTC #ETH #Power

1218 2018-09-18 20:38:18 So cool to see another option for Canadians wanting to onramp into #crypto. @CoinSmartCA launched in July. Testing just now, I was able to trade & withdraw coin. As always, be careful with new exchanges, but this feels legit. Even chatted with live support! [Code: Greg1031]
1219 2018-09-18 20:38:17 RT readDanwrite: yup, cannabis stocks are the new crypto. "Good for you if you bought Tilray. Good for you if you bought Canopy Growth. But we've got another 500 [cannabis] securities out there, and 90% of them are frauds and aren't going to make it." YahooFinance leemunson …

1244 2018-09-18 20:35:17 Sorry to nitpick, but that’s kinda my point. There was no one week hold for 3.75 to 20. It’s totally impossible. If you were perfect, there was a three week hold from $3.75 to $18.99. If so, good trade. I just know the original statement couldn’t be true.

1260 2018-09-18 20:32:48 I guess you are on hopium like all the alt coins promoters, Tone actually says not to buy on a bear market, for me he's one of the most responsible analyst in the crypto space
1261 2018-09-18 20:32:39 This is what I was trying to say. I think they are going for the guinness book of world records for most podcasts!
1262 2018-09-18 20:32:34 Since entering the crypto space I have found comfort in the hope it provides that there will be another solution to finding financial security in my older years. A security that governments have a harder time affecting. Hope is ine of the best things blockchain tech can give.

1264 2018-09-18 20:32:19 Pro crypto is probably not the right word. Hester isn't even really pro crypto. It is about being pro free markets and a view of a SEC with a more limited scope (instead of a helicopter parent as Hester put).  Next tweet on Elad (out of characters)
1265 2018-09-18 20:32:07 I think its more likely an ETF gets approved because of changes in the fundamental issues re: surveillance-sharing & market manipulation rather than appointment of pro-crypto Commissioners.

Also important: pro-crypto doesn't mean agreeing with Hester's Section 6(b)(5) reading.

Agree on your second point, but another "no" is more likely. Being pro-crypto is still very unfashionable in the legacy finance world.

1280 2018-09-18 20:29:27 Well there is a new commissioner now (who is supposedly pro crypto) and another new commissioner in January. As Alex said if they are remotely like Hester then it gets approved in Feb. All the details in the old denials would be irrelevant at that point.

1323 2018-09-18 20:24:04 At absolute minimum we are replacing an empty seat with a commissioner who is thought to be pro crypto (we don't know that 100%). And then we will replace a "no" with a "we don't know", which is obviously superior to a no.

1333 2018-09-18 20:21:20 It has come to my attention that calling a #top is in fact gayer than calling a #bottom. In conclusion, no matter what you do in #crypto everyone is a lil #gay #enlightenment
1334 2018-09-18 20:21:11 That's right. Didn't want to sound anyhow offensive. Sorry, if I did.
1335 2018-09-18 20:21:05 I actually thought you were joking Re FUD. Supply can’t be tampered with thankfully but I get how certain fin instruments can “increase” supply. Institutional investors would need to come in heavy and soon
1336 2018-09-18 20:20:47 I’m confused how so many people can be bearish

To the glory of DAPS! 
1339 2018-09-18 20:20:29 There were a lot of people that quit their day jobs early this year to go “full-time crypto” which is AWESOME, but... how is that going?!

1342 2018-09-18 20:20:12 I think that the project will be implemented in the crypto world, but a lot depends on large investors, how much they like this project. You will surprised with this project  #RealtyReturns #RRT #RealtyReturns_ICO #ico #blockchain #ethereum

1346 2018-09-18 20:19:24 We should all denounce @aantonop and anyone opposed to non-crypto-purists ie laypeople owning exposure to the asset class.

Reduced volatility leads to adoption. Until a business can plan next year's budget and payroll on BTC it is not adopted.

1350 2018-09-18 20:18:30 I'm right there with you. If $BTC does not become mainstream , in other words if no one else spends their fiat to buy $crypto on a large scale , how the hell do you expect to make x10, x100, moon , lambo whatever , lol

ETFs are necessary to reduce volatility which is necessary for BTC to become money to be used for international money transfer to circumvent the SWIFT network.

This is kinda the same thing. The government will never tell us.
1472 2018-09-18 19:58:24 Once again the FUD is coming out of the derivatives thought where banks sell 1 $BTC each to 10 separate people. Unless the economy is pegged to $BTC directly though I fail to see how this alone will bring down $BTC.

How will you cope with your existence and make a living?

If XRP is down, they show it front and center..

When XRP is waaaaaaay up, they don't even mention it.

Sure glad the crypto community is bigger now and does its own reporting
1579 2018-09-18 19:41:47 The G20 stating a few months back that crypto is NOT a risk for the current financial system is probably the biggest mistake they've made.

1605 2018-09-18 19:37:58 Keep up the great work! When valuation catches up to fundamentals it’s going to move something scary.
1606 2018-09-18 19:37:51 Too extreme. IMO way higher. Look at the new comissioner elaid roisman(pro crypto), and leaving any moment commissioner kara stein(max december), this wil put it 2-2 in case of review. + this ETF has greater prospects. I would say 10% now and 90% feb 2019.

1717 2018-09-18 19:19:16 It is one of the best! Makes me chuckle everyone I see it! 
1718 2018-09-18 19:19:00 Contrarian to some of the other commissioners and to Alex I guess. I completely agree with Hester though
1719 2018-09-18 19:18:51 We know for a fact during a recession discretionary spending drops drastically and the need for cash rises drastically. So in order for crypto currency to hold value in this scenario, people would need to not sell, even though they need the money, which I see as unlikely.
1720 2018-09-18 19:18:46 Never was a fan, I relate to & respect your struggle. If what you say is true I will also support your projects. Please keep using your platform to bring awareness to disproportionate "justice" for black men, people of color & poor people everywhere!
1721 2018-09-18 19:18:32 A little of everything . But I wouldn’t depend on crypto currency to hold value during an economic down turn. The crypto markets are mostly fueled by individual discretionary spending and seemingly favorable economic conditions.
1722 2018-09-18 19:18:26 Well, that's because money is flowing into something that has the potential to succeed..
1723 2018-09-18 19:18:20 Seems fair

1728 2018-09-18 19:17:57 It’s not contrarian. One of the 4 SEC commissioners has exactly this view. Her view is the SEC can help make safer more regulated markets or force investors into the Wild West

1736 2018-09-18 19:16:40 you shouldn't have tweeted this
1737 2018-09-18 19:16:36 Fact is crypto anarchists were right about everything
1738 2018-09-18 19:16:27 FU I’m 35!
1739 2018-09-18 19:16:16 Yes. When we mute/block others cuz we disagree w/something they said then we are actually shorting ourselves (closing the door of opportunity). We miss a chance 2 learn something new about them & ourself. I always say I’m #bearish on  but I’m hopeful that sum day it will change
1740 2018-09-18 19:16:08 Et les vendeurs se mettront aux crypto-monnaies... Encore plus complexes à tracer...
1741 2018-09-18 19:16:04 そしてこっちがイーサリアムだ。色々と融通が効くので大切に使っていきたい通貨だな。このお金は燃やすことによって様々な契約を行える。この時間になったら送金できるようにするとか、他の通貨での支払いをトンネルするみたいなこともできるぞ。ビットコインについで人気が高い、良い通貨だ。

1750 2018-09-18 19:15:08 Hahaha
1751 2018-09-18 19:14:55 the more reason why crypto is not for weaker it is for risk taker. avoid ico from today if you do invest make your own research, so many ico is scam i'v been a victim once. be careful you all.
1752 2018-09-18 19:14:47 “Great” is a strong word.

Keep up the phenomenal job & remarkable calls!!

1758 2018-09-18 19:14:00 Thank you for your service! The biggest hurdle in getting people into crypto is the economic understanding of why it is different and needed for personal freedom. Y’all rock!

1762 2018-09-18 19:13:51 How come u never see ugly chicks as "crypto enthusiasts"? Is it because only the attractive ones show their face? Are they crypto posers looking for likes? Is it only that beautiful people are smart enough to be in crypto? Do ugly ones just hide behind avatars? I HAVE QUESTIONS
1763 2018-09-18 19:13:27 couldn't agree more !
1764 2018-09-18 19:13:23 Just watched your video. #Tolar has 9.6m market cap?  Isn't market cap = circulating supply*price? What u mentioned was their hard cap. I would stay away from tolar as it was sold hard on #ico pools. I believe they have collected much much more than $9.6m

1769 2018-09-18 19:12:58 It seems like you’re saying that it’s one thing to be self-aware, and we humans are obviously that. We’re sentient. But, we should strive to be aware of others also. I don’t think there’s a modern word for that... maybe conscient?
1770 2018-09-18 19:12:52 Contrarian view:  Shouldn't this be a sign that the SEC needs to step in and approve a highly regulated ETF so that investors have a safe market to buy in?

1787 2018-09-18 19:11:08 Won't recommend atm.. if you investing ask yourself this question

Why would someone use crypto for hiring?

1789 2018-09-18 19:10:52 Good point

I agree it can’t be stopped, but the end result and how it gets there may be very different from what we can anticipate today

The future of crypto is uncertain, but a future of crypto is certain

1808 2018-09-18 19:07:56 So, like remove yourself from the context of the conversation and read/listen to understand rather than to reply? I think we should all try to do that more often. Maybe, then the world would be a better place.
1809 2018-09-18 19:07:51 Tbh, it's more safe that a BTC ETF exists (eventually), so the investors don't have to seek other ways to invest in crypto and get scammed. But that's just my 2 cents.
1810 2018-09-18 19:07:42 @xcryptclub will be an indispensable system within the financial system and everyday life, based on #blockchain, which will unite the industry of crypto-currency transactions, thus allowing to trade digital assets and network marketing in one person!

1815 2018-09-18 19:07:00 Hi @aantonop Have you researched @EarthDollar? It's a decentralized token system that incentivizes individuals to undertake clean-up, planting trees, poverty activism, secured by smart contracts, w/ consensus. Could this be a bridge between crypto and a more sustainable world?
1816 2018-09-18 19:06:44 That’s exactly what I am saying brother. I keep buying every paycheck I get and frankly the further it goes down the more excited I am because I know what the future holds because of my crypto ball

1820 2018-09-18 19:06:06 This latest New York report on crypto, besides pointing out flaws and clear concerns that could make exchanges improve, also adds more legitimacy to the space imho.

It might make some nocoiners think.

So I'd call it good news.

1861 2018-09-18 18:58:57 I like the theory that it is referring to COMEX rule 589- a rule that prevents silver prices from skyrocketing during periods of no/low trade volume; a rule that crypto exchanges don't have.
1862 2018-09-18 18:58:53 Do you think 6300 is a good level to short?

Just because a crash hasn’t happened yet, doesn’t mean it has to now

Crypto, if it succeeds, would become a means of exchange. Not just an asset

1867 2018-09-18 18:58:06 Very nice!  
1868 2018-09-18 18:58:02 As long as the price goes up idc. If it stays suppressed under 20k forever then you have a point. Rn that’s all speculation.

1871 2018-09-18 18:57:31 hmmmmm.... IMO well timed article to scare off the sheep .. Is someone trying to make sure average JOE doesn't come into the crypto market... "Exchanges are manipulated" & "It's not safe" ... WSJ .. That's real news right... respectable journalism... ok.. 
1872 2018-09-18 18:57:01 Is there an opportunity to fork #cryptotwitter? 

A second platform "Serious Crypto"
  
This would be the "Entertainment Crypto" so... not much would change 

LMK if you would be interested in working on something similar !

ANY feedback is Appreciated!! THANK YOU 
1873 2018-09-18 18:56:57 For US people that a given!

1879 2018-09-18 18:56:00 Macro factor modelling for crypto is never going to produce constant positive results. C'est la vie.

1882 2018-09-18 18:55:28 call me a gossip monger if u must ()....i do know for a fact that the mining of crypto currency requires an unusually large amount of energy.
1883 2018-09-18 18:55:01 Great prospects! The project is constantly attracting the growing interest of both the global audience and investors! I am sure that the company will show excellent results! Join the powerful ICO! #crypto #oppopenwifi

1885 2018-09-18 18:54:46 Just wondering if we'll see ETF hype flow into BTC. Other than that, no reason to think BTC could hold above $6k for much longer
1886 2018-09-18 18:54:36 With which part? My assertion that there is NO crash coming or that crypto is a lot more than crash protection or both?
1887 2018-09-18 18:54:24 I thought it was happening mid Sept. I figured crypto ppl will buy Eth real cheap. rally if up. (was 40% of my holding )
1888 2018-09-18 18:54:16 I loved bitcoin when you could send $100m for .04c but now it's riddled with problems, blocksize issues, tether fraud likely, ect ect. I use to be a huge crypto bull a while back but I haven't wanted to touch it for the past year

1895 2018-09-18 18:52:36 No need to question or ask him anything, he isn't informed at all, even the FDIC and other body despite the thought that crypto was used to fund illicit cat, they came to the conclusion it was a wrong thought

1905 2018-09-18 18:51:00 There are MAJOR investment firms/Banking institutions behind #xrp and probably even more looking into Crypto as a possible way to build income for clients- last I heard like 70 or 80 Banking firms, that's alot of investments, growth, and influx of people into the #crypto space.

1952 2018-09-18 18:44:52 But why? Kucoin seems to be slowly dying.. no volume at all. Coins like HKN and CXO can go for hours without a single trade.
1953 2018-09-18 18:44:52 No one here fears change.

If you'd like to change BTC into something that is conceptually no longer bitcoin, then you are an altcoin to many people here. Full stop.

1975 2018-09-18 18:40:59 From a macro perspective crypto is apart of the “Everything Bubble.” A $17 bln asset class that one year later is $833 bln doesn’t happen unless the legacy system itself is so broken. Crypto will not escape the effects of a global economic crisis. The end is near for US mkts

1983 2018-09-18 18:39:37 7/ Why can’t I sell crypto which amounts to anything less than ₹5000 on #DCXinsta? This limit ensures that sellers do not go through the hassle of placing multiple small orders. It also reduces the number of overall bank transactions.

1994 2018-09-18 18:38:55 4/ When will the limit order feature be available for buying crypto using INR? #DCXinsta is not made to place #LimitOrders, but soon you will be able to place #LimitOrders with INR. Guess the feature!

1998 2018-09-18 18:38:43 細かい額のビットコインを大量に受け取っていると（例えば，1時間ごとに自動受信する形のハイプで）「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」のために，送金手数料があとで多額になる可能性があるような気がします。
1999 2018-09-18 18:38:28 En cette année plutôt compliqué, je tiens quand même à dire qu’on est plutôt tenaces.

Merci à tous pour me/nous donner la force et l’envie de continuer l’aventure. 
2000 2018-09-18 18:38:24 2/ On selling crypto on #DCXinsta, how much time does it take to receive INR withdrawal in a user's bank account? Once your sell order is matched with a buyer, they are presented with your bank details. Buyers pay within 5-10 minutes of order creation.

2012 2018-09-18 18:36:17 It shouldn’t hurt. If you believe in crypto you’d better put your fiat into it! Keep accumulating. But only with money you can afford to lose. I can’t empathize this enough.

2048 2018-09-18 18:31:21 what’s the tldr?
2049 2018-09-18 18:31:21 That may explain the "connectivity issues" that i experienced on a Poloniex margin that i couldn't close for hours at the peak.

That was a lot of money zapped.

But hey, i got "We apologize for the inconvenience" and "We are not responsible for connect. issues" so it's fine.

2052 2018-09-18 18:31:07 You’re probably right. I didn’t realize he was probably just craving attention. That’s my bad for giving it to him.
2053 2018-09-18 18:31:01 Yeah but I wonder how much of this activity is some version of riskless principal.  The markets on Coinbase are always significantly wider than most other crypto exchanges, so I would almost expect them to take the other side of *every* trade and close out simultaneously.

2058 2018-09-18 18:30:32 Delisting from Bittrex usually made sense tho. It was often due to consistent low volume or failure to comply with regulations like coins that could be considered securities. Poloniex feels like it's just purging things to open space.
2059 2018-09-18 18:30:25 I think it's all in the way you communicate & express your opinion. You are entitled to your opinion but just keep in mind that as women in crypto we have to deal w/issues that men don't have to deal with. It's understandable if some women are a little more senstive to hater-aid.

2135 2018-09-18 18:18:21 yeah really great report. thanks to to government for forcing third parties to mitigate risks that I am of course too stupid to accept for myself.

2138 2018-09-18 18:17:14 Ask any questions you have about Bitcoin or crypto and I'm happy to answer them!

Don't let these power hungry politicians fool you, Bitcoin is a wonderful thing.
2139 2018-09-18 18:17:04 As a female in crypto, it kind of comes with the territory. I've had to deal w/pricks on here just because I wouldn't do what they wanted or I disagreed with their opinion. It doesn't matter how nice you are or even how much of a douche you are, haters gon hate.
2140 2018-09-18 18:16:48 Good fr the crypto space. ICOs are dump money collectors.

2144 2018-09-18 18:16:17 Thanks Leo for the information. But what concerns me is that they launch the exchange in VN first in August 2018 (their timeline) and offer VND pair where regulation is extremely strict and not open to crypto yet. Hope it is legit

2158 2018-09-18 18:13:57 Take away all external factors, when u long or short any trade, there is a 50/50 chance you get it right. It’s that simple. Your odds are much greater if you just go in the direction the stock/crypto is moving. To be wrong going in the same direction you’ve got to be very unlucky

total supply bezop: 89.267.250 - I hold 68.168 = 0,0764%
market cap = $2.417.890 USD = my coins worth 3.265$

2168 2018-09-18 18:11:54 Agree. Not only are fees in BCH ‘free’ they are predictable. Every company looking to integrate Crypto must have predictability first and foremost. There is ways to hedge against volatility but if transactions are uncertain everything else fails.

2220 2018-09-18 18:04:41 I think this is the greatest idea this year. With a very supportive  team, it can reach the all milestones within a short time period and  become a very successive project in the crypto market. @xcryptclub
2221 2018-09-18 18:04:36 This is true. We are committed to community growth as a whole and completely inclusive to any and all projects. The community can judge the merits of each, as it is not our place to do so. @DerekCapo is on board with this philosophy and the Twitter management change. We listen.
2222 2018-09-18 18:04:33 if previous opinions were in fact the echoes of the CEO but they're turning over a new leaf and seeking a more team-fostered professional approach to #crypto, I still think it's worth cautiously pursuing, with all necessary due diligence, respect, and professionalism.
2223 2018-09-18 18:04:33 Heck, you could even run a DAP with Codius and pay with ETH. So, I think what will really matter for Crypto is its utility for payments. Almost everything else is better-done off-chain.

2226 2018-09-18 18:04:01 Well, ironically, the worse the behavior of the enemy, the more important the anonymity. But, like crypto, it is used both ways. Being an open target is not fun, especially when there is no gain whatsoever, except perhaps a shot at asserting some truth, backed by data.

2253 2018-09-18 18:00:54 The people I tell about crypto keep waiting on all their other friends to start talking about it before they consider it, but by the time they consider it good to buy, it will already have increased in value due to all of that widespread adoption they waited on.

2265 2018-09-18 17:59:08 Lool, first you have to know what Crypto is before we know if it should come under the scrutiny of the SEC - i am an independent trader and analyst not invovled with capital market & not offering investments to anyone.
2266 2018-09-18 17:58:47 If you think we’ve seen the top and won’t go higher, then you’ve probably been trading for less than 2 years and have no experience inside of crypto. FIXED NP ANYTIME PEACE

2274 2018-09-18 17:57:56 In what reality is crypto used more than the USD for "$laundering and RICO'S". Should we call for a "shutdown" of the $USD too?
2275 2018-09-18 17:57:50 This is an awesome project, I am convinced that it will show great results! I believe that this project will find its place in it and maybe even become one of the leading ones in the future.I see huge potential for success in the future.

2290 2018-09-18 17:55:48 You drew you support line with a incorrect initial data point. The wedge begins after the first selling climax.  Resistance line should begin after the climax, not at the local ATH.

2302 2018-09-18 17:54:36 You read too much paid advertising. Not a good thing for a crypto guy. Facebook pays a lot to release fake numbers. We can easily calculate the number of deleted accounts to be even higher, considering the huge decline in page reach to 100s of pages we are attached to.

2377 2018-09-18 17:43:25 Yes a bull market would be nice. But this cheap accumulation phase can go on longer in my opinion. If you picked projects wisely the dividends in the end will be that much better. Disclaimer: if your treating crypto as a short term lottery, of course this bear market sucks.
2378 2018-09-18 17:43:10 the biggest mistake in crypto space that you are not understand what you invest in. don't follow media or someone else to cash in. invest in yourself.
2379 2018-09-18 17:42:59 It took me a few mos. but I've come to totally respect young people's view of music. If one thing is true young folk won't sit still, remain stagnant or let bull shit go on too long. It happens with everything, as it should. It's their turn to lead & direct the discourse.

2404 2018-09-18 17:38:57 Not snappy, there’s just ther ways to get crypto. Google it
2405 2018-09-18 17:38:56 I assume the tokens are just another form, a another vehicle used to invest in a crypto company.
2406 2018-09-18 17:38:51 I really get annoyed by crypto-famous people who have "calling bottom" lately. Only real-world adoption is going to set bottoms anymore. 

Moralistic arguments on blockchain aren't cutting it anymore. Time to see some real-world contributions and value.
2407 2018-09-18 17:38:47 Is this crypto?
2408 2018-09-18 17:38:30 Its decentralised its disruptive its the future of money just get with the program and buy some crypto’s
2409 2018-09-18 17:38:11 I think we need to even get past “crypto.” The word is starting to shut people’s brains off the moment it’s brought up same as I’ve seen it shut off for “federal reserve” or “monetary policy” many a time with @YALiberty.
2410 2018-09-18 17:38:05 You put me on! That grinder only needs like two turns tho' more is wasted flavor.

2493 2018-09-18 17:27:08 That's an interesting point and good question. They usually seize, then auction at a later date. I imagine it will be auctioned off in smaller lots, then returned into the crypto ecosystem via auction.
2494 2018-09-18 17:27:05 Further I see now a long term disappointment in XRP (SEC etc), powered by crypto bear market for 8 months. Expect a jump for XRP with Xrapid (proof of use case), powered by bull crypto run in general. But why and how could Ripple manipulate the market. Just theoretically?
2495 2018-09-18 17:27:05 BTC is a dead coin. No adoption, economics model ruined by core. No future.

If you think BCH is dead then you might as well quit crypto because it's the only coin out there that has any potential as cash.

2512 2018-09-18 17:25:30 You have a group that is taught about obedience to the licensing authority on one side and on the other Crypto that defines the complete opposite.

2513 2018-09-18 17:25:15 The fucked up part for me now is: I'm a broke student, 18 years old and managed to put a few hundred bucks in crypto.

4. Be mentally prepared for big moves, even to the downside
5. See point number one.

2520 2018-09-18 17:24:40 The biggest obstacle to crypto adoption is not archaic regulation or crude market infrastructure.

It is negative stigma caused by “evangelists” who are happy to scream in your face how bitcoin is the future but unwilling to commit 20 hours to learning about why.

2535 2018-09-18 17:23:03 When half of the crypto community is more concerned about making memes than learning how to trade this was pretty predictable
2536 2018-09-18 17:23:02 Tucked into a footnote on Page 8 is what IMHO is the core of the problem: (“Crypto-assets also raise concerns related to misconduct and market integrity – many appear vulnerable to fraud and manipulation, as well as money-laundering and terrorist financing risks.”)

2573 2018-09-18 17:16:12 Your ability to make prescient claims on the future is limited by your lack of experience as an investor and your inherent bias towards anything crypto. On top of that you’ve been making bad calls for the past twelve months. This call is no different.

Personally the vendors I use crypo with accepts BTC and LTC, but I always use LTC to TX because I know it will be cheaper, and quicker conf

2592 2018-09-18 17:13:58 1/ What to look for if buying during the crypto bear market:

A) Tech Progress
-Evidence the blockchain is used.
-Number of smart contracts. If the only contract is the one issuing the token, then the blockchain isn’t integral.
-GitHub commits. If not open source, video demo

Segwit adoption on BTC: Segwit is being adopted on LTC too. Regardless LTC TX will almost always be quicker that BTC TX (2.5min vs 10 min avg block time) 
LTC has its LN network too.

2665 2018-09-18 17:04:46 Well, many actually. I think satoshilite selloff tweet de facto started the bear market.
2666 2018-09-18 17:04:32 PA just looked so weak barely hovering over EQ for me to have longed. That's why confirmation is so important. The 1H even had a bearish SFP. Still watching closely. #BTCUSD $BTC $ETH $Crypto #Trader #bitcoin
2667 2018-09-18 17:04:29 Update: Stablecoin panel will be next month, @edmund_schuster's horse has hay fever. 

Now brainstorming a "Bitcoin Culture 101" talk, can anyone help with suggestions? Terms like hodl and moon, important history and stories, etc. What does someone new to crypto need to know?
2668 2018-09-18 17:04:22 Great to play my part in the new @Talent Garden space in Dublin as part of their 30 seminars in 30 days. Thanks to the team there for hosting and to those that attended my seminar on "Raising Finance as Crypto or Blockchain Business" #crypto #blockchain

2674 2018-09-18 17:03:20 Nice trade!! But I personally find manipulation a bold statement without a real argument. Yes many coins jumped craZy in that period. I would call it crypto fomo.
2675 2018-09-18 17:03:17 I do.  Since i was on one.  LMAO
2676 2018-09-18 17:03:13 So why would vendors choose a crypto like this and not a more established crypto. 
What does thc offer
2677 2018-09-18 17:02:47 DN rarely talks about crypto - which is a shame because it has some great utility cases that fit their programming. Frictionless remittance pay for low wage workers for example....can't do that with the current system! Looking forward to learning more of what you have to say.

2701 2018-09-18 16:59:15 How exactly is it ultra manipulated? And every crypto is generated by a central party. Satoshi created 21M Bitcoin and then cryptographically locked it into a ridiculous power sucking algorithm game.
2702 2018-09-18 16:59:12 Same thing happened to me with crypto. Fuck it 
2703 2018-09-18 16:58:41 Üstad btc nin yönü ne tarafa.burdan 6800 diyen var.5800 diyen var .sizin net bir kararınız var mı.yoksa bilinmez bir durum mu var .açıklarsanız memnun olurum.çünkü bütün altlar buna göre hareket ediyor.

2804 2018-09-18 16:45:04 The team P2PSF only lists one developer with blockchain development experience so I'm assuming they have hired more since the system of meta-mining and token economics seems pretty complex. #ICO #P2PSF #Crypto #Altcoin #Blockchain

 So much of @CoinMarketCap still seems way overvalued. A few that catch my eye: $XRP $LTC $EOS $TRX $ETC $XTZ & lol $MIOTA
 I think $EOS has a shot long term, but the valuation is bananas right now

How many high profile figures do that when things are good, and warn others?

2839 2018-09-18 16:40:42 The crypto conferences ticket entry are generally eye watering compared to the social media ones back in the day — that’s to me the biggest difference of this wave, some made a lot of money out of the gates (not in social media).
2840 2018-09-18 16:40:35 Shorting crypto would be a cool opportunity. It would be all marketing because the only way to successfully short is to convince people it's BS. 

Probably not practical, but there aren't going to be many companies where marketing is the core product of the company.
2841 2018-09-18 16:40:19 Aight, where do you want it?
2842 2018-09-18 16:40:03 Also, we shouldn't confuse complexity with design. In fact, if there was a designer, a lot of things would be simpler. No designer would make quantum particles, for example, that can jump in and out of existence at random

It's an interesting philosophical rabbit hole for sure!
2843 2018-09-18 16:39:43 Time to short ze $XRP scam 
2844 2018-09-18 16:39:24 You continue to divide the community, making Bitcoin and Crypto look bad.  This is bad for everyone, including Bcash.

2847 2018-09-18 16:38:47 Facts:

BTC is a commodity.

Most commodities have traded below cost of production at one point.

Therefore, the argument that BTC's price will never fall below mining cost is completely absurd.

It's a false narrative that has infected crypto and will lead people off a cliff.

2857 2018-09-18 16:36:40 Ok.  When the chairman of the SEC says something in public commentary it's got more weight than your opinion.  

I'll repeat: DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE RISK OF $XRP BEING A SECURITY.
 
Crypto is a 4 sigma event so this shit doesn't follow normal log and rules.  Protect yourself.
2858 2018-09-18 16:36:35 Crypto-currencies are proof otherwise: private keys, protocols, transactions, hardware ... but no government nor coercion.

Black markets don't require governments either - they work despite government opposition.

I like certain things about each one & therefore, hold both.

2915 2018-09-18 16:28:00 Yeah that was my point: My personal grudges over xlm > shortterm profit
I think longterm its just not a good investment, although it might become a good crypto someday

2937 2018-09-18 16:24:34 Hi, keep it nice please. But no the SEC didn’t decide on any crypto officially (including btc and Eth). I don’t think they will do soon tbh. I think they wait and look at Asia. But here we look different at US. Not so important.

2971 2018-09-18 16:19:38 A lot of people throw flak at @TusharJain_ and @KyleSamani for believing in EOS.

2973 2018-09-18 16:19:20 No agree. But scarcity does.. The way I forsee it, but i compare it to current banking, market makers will jump in crypto like they do in Forex. Most likely expensive corridors first. Otherwise I don’t see crypto used by banks EVER.

3011 2018-09-18 16:15:41 Unpopular opinion. #XRP is the first coin to achieve true utility. Begins replacing BTC as base pair, and becomes the foundation for the real crypto boom.

3015 2018-09-18 16:15:07 Very strong point. But then the gain is back to the speculation aspect of the crypto world once again. Everyone buying cause they see large transactions on the xrp ledger. Trust me I have a lot of faith in the asset but there’s questions that need to be looked at.

These 2 facts combined spell doom once the non-educated crypto investors discover these facts, which will be widely known soon.

3059 2018-09-18 16:10:02 Как я понял смысл Web Crypto API, он ждёт первый случайный байт, а дальше генерирует остальные по псевдослучайному алгоритму. Скорее всего это ближе к /dev/urandom. Но всё равно первый байт надо ждать.

3063 2018-09-18 16:09:37 Ah okay fair point. Price prediction is indeed tricky. But remember 2017? I mean happened . . But this is a more general crypto debate. XRP is still tied to BTC, so without discussing BTC almost impossible. But I do think IF xrapid is live and IF crypto in general goes up. Easy

I still periodically wonder about it.

3184 2018-09-18 15:53:53 My debit card restricted again for unusual activity by @BankofAmerica ... second time in 2 weeks. These fraud detection false alarms cause so much pain and wasted time. Do you wonder why people flock to crypto? Even us OVERbanked will ALL be coming over to crypto. Get used to it!

3186 2018-09-18 15:53:44 Further.. a Xcurrent installation at a bank cost around 10M usd. A reason i know some don’t do it. However, they signed 100 plus banks, who now can easily start using crypto (XRP). With the current price however, there is not enough liquidity in some corridors for sure.
3187 2018-09-18 15:53:39 @Twitter what do you think about demoting all replies by unverified accounts with the same display name of the tweet-er? I.e. people trying to impersonate [@elonmusk] running crypto scams like erryday.

I'm not agreeing with the guy. The guy's a piece of shit. When you look at his body of work though, I don't understand the shock. Really? You didn't expect something this douché?

See you tonight @billburr
3197 2018-09-18 15:51:56 Disagree.  All exchanges track closely though arbitrage. But coinbase is THE gateway between crypto and AML-compliant fiat.   It is the ONLY exchange worth tracking.  Prices can only be manipulated with tether to the extent that sellers for fiat get paid on coinbase.

3200 2018-09-18 15:51:15 Difficult to answer cause I am a big investor and believe in XRP. Got very lucky with crypto in 2016, so no emotions anymore for me, but ofcourse biased when talking XRP as a holder. But YES Xrapid is the liquidity solution for banks and yes utility will drive price up.

3220 2018-09-18 15:48:17 Maximalism isn’t discounted if you focus on price(as a trader that’s what he does  for a living lols). Price can be seen as a function of adoption. Maximalism is belief that btc is the only form of sound money in crypto and it will be the only cryoto in the very long run

3233 2018-09-18 15:46:13 how do you explain to someone that tether is used to buy crypto and if tether goes down alot of peoples ability to transfer tether onto exchanges and buy crypto goes down

3235 2018-09-18 15:45:53 There are always motivations. It is whether anybody is aware of those aggregate motivations. Perhaps you do if you have close relationships with the crypto whales (in which case you should divulge your sources). Otherwise the above holds.

3306 2018-09-18 15:35:46 TBH, I don't think #trx or #xrp are going to die. There is banks and governments involved and particularly those governments are willing to throw money at things they deem important. They kept most banks alive in 2009 which cost a lot more than the total market cap of #crypto.

3353 2018-09-18 15:30:27 It's move making - look at the Crypto global market cap.... This is assets morphing rather than totally new money coming into the xrp ecosystem....  Asset classes within Crypto are moving hands
3354 2018-09-18 15:30:19 Is it just me or is everyone else's Blockfolio broken? It hasn't shown the right numbers since January this year...it was promised that my profits would be enormous by now! #crypto #bearmarket #dip #justrednumbers #reversedreturns #altseason #stillbullish #cryptocurrency
3355 2018-09-18 15:30:04 So I'm leaving my company at the end of September. Been sending out resume and so far none has replied. Might spend some time day trading while awaiting responds.

3363 2018-09-18 15:29:07 Remember folks, $XRP is centralized and in bed with governments. Your choice, your future......unfortunately noobs will  eat XRP and only increase its price. Great for trading short term as it has no future value. #xrp #bitcoin $btc #crypto #blockchain
3364 2018-09-18 15:28:51 Xrp was my first buy in crypto..  with no other information and my own research my first intuition led me to believe in xrp 
3365 2018-09-18 15:28:34 Banks would prefer a cashless society, where they hold all of the money all the time while overseeing all of the transactions.....and they need to do it before crypto becomes mainstream.

Bitcoin or nothing.

Revolution or evolution.

3605 2018-09-18 15:00:33 Depends on the delivery method. Would be curious to how they are going to get the claimants back their BTC. Would think they would liquidate a pool of BTC and settle in cash for claimants that don't want BTC. The remaining, I am unsure about.
3606 2018-09-18 15:00:29 Did you ever talk about tradefinex?
3607 2018-09-18 15:00:21 If you could go back to December 2017, what would you do differently? #crypto
3608 2018-09-18 15:00:14 That opinion is garbage
3609 2018-09-18 15:00:12 すみません、ついネタにしてしまいましたが嫌味とかではなくCrypto界隈向けの表現です！

ちなみにこの発言に対するリプを見ると上場ネタやBancor等、色々なネタが出てきて更にお楽しみいただけるかと思います。

Un petit dump pour faire un achat par cher ?
3623 2018-09-18 14:58:32 I just ignore Kyle, but I saw his post- I thought it was funny when he called $LTC functionally useless- I guess he hasn’t used crypto for business/payments. 

If anything, $BTC was functionally useless. $LTC was the useful, functional, liquid alternative.

3626 2018-09-18 14:58:00 I've been using MoneyDance do track all crypto transactions as separate currencies since 2013. Works great. Also made use of its python scripting support to add support for figuring out market values and generating long / short cap gains reports.
Can be done. Must be done.

3637 2018-09-18 14:57:00 The difference J is social media spawned many very successful companies and ecosystems. Blockchain (which doesn't mean anything by itself who cares) and Crypto (overhyped) may not provide near the same impact to economies.
3638 2018-09-18 14:57:00 you could participate in the @Join_Civil token sale and get crypto news outlets to apply to the TCR of high quality news organizations...

3659 2018-09-18 14:54:43 No matter which way the market will go, accurate long-term price predictions are hard to make. More importantly, even if they hit the that-and-that mark, it will not stick to it for long. In our opinion, crypto market is unpredictable - better to analyze short-term fluctuations.
3660 2018-09-18 14:54:42 Already out. Going short again brother
3661 2018-09-18 14:54:36 That is us in the crypto market 
3662 2018-09-18 14:54:34 I've only ever seen "autistic" used as a compliment, especially on #crypto Twitter.

3664 2018-09-18 14:54:28 I could do a whole video about how ridiculous and emotional the crypto space is. It is really sad that people will insult you on socila media and say downright disgusting inhumane things they would never say in person all over an investment. GROW UP!

3687 2018-09-18 14:52:32 THANK GOD - maybe, just maybe, we are going to bottom out in the next month or 2. Nothing (in life or crypto or markets) goes in a straight line.
3688 2018-09-18 14:52:24 As I look at the crypto alt market here quite a few things could be hitting a range base. I'll be watching for things to make higher lows on any pullback as well as correlating MAs and supporting price action
3689 2018-09-18 14:52:22 “Some crypto” Amazing!
3690 2018-09-18 14:52:14 @b0xNet bZx deployed its protocol to the Ethereum mainnet after passing a successful audit by ZK Labs. ZK Labs is a leading security auditor in the blockchain space.  Excellent Project that will surely succeed!! #ICO #Airdrop #Bounty #Crypto

3700 2018-09-18 14:50:50 I once overheard a convo between to women about a former friend:

"Did I fuck ____?" "Yes of course everybody done hit that!"

I once told him everybody had to in-process his bedroom upon arrival, only to find out it was the women passing him around like a piece of meat. #GrowUp

3706 2018-09-18 14:50:13 I don’t trust this. At all. (Yet)
3707 2018-09-18 14:50:02 Yes. Now we are on accumulation
Maybe 1-2 times we can see hard down for all coins but they will back up again
The biggest bad scenerio
They will go down nearly %20-50 from their last weeks deep
But this is last bad scenerio
And if we see that.Bullish will start hardly from there
3708 2018-09-18 14:49:59 Not invest in crypto at all until August 2018.

3733 2018-09-18 14:47:51 Guide to Crypto Twitter Trading Terms:

Volatility incoming = I'm really bored
Small position = I'm balls deep & terrified
Waiting for confirmation = Shit I FOMO'd in
Stop at breakeven = I regret this trade
Stopped out in profit = Full size loss
Stops taken = WTF is this wick
3734 2018-09-18 14:47:51 In college I learned that this is a right of passage moment for many on Spring Break or vacation. It made me open my eyes, & really look inward. All those jump offs & Thots etc are using people for their own fantasies. It turns the phrase "Ladies man" upside down.

- Speculating

- Hold a bunch of tokens

Point blank, we deserved this crash. The crypto of 2017 was overhyped.

3755 2018-09-18 14:46:32 Probably invested on some scam.  The crypto world corrupts many.
3756 2018-09-18 14:46:30 Jimmy could you pls elavorate the hidden meaning behind this?  Something got to do with crypto media
3757 2018-09-18 14:46:24 実はものすごく尊敬しております。

3759 2018-09-18 14:46:09 そっちはVertCoinだな。ライトコインに引き続き耐ASICを目的として作られた通貨だ。ASICはより強固なセキュリティを得るのに良い方法なんだが、如何せん一般人の参入障壁になってしまってな。セキュアを犠牲にして参入障壁を取っ払っているぞ。グラボがあれば誰でも掘れる。

3764 2018-09-18 14:45:50 Also this is for binance analyze.
For poloniex xrp is bullish.
Bullish start on poloniex.
So l can say you that
On binance we will see 6300.
It will be soon.

3777 2018-09-18 14:44:10 Thanks for the chance
dear dev.. winning me for my journey in crypto. it's great opportunity for me because it's a big amount in Indian currency

3778 2018-09-18 14:44:08 I bought it at 303 sats and sold it at 305, it doesn’t look very bullish to me

3780 2018-09-18 14:43:41 L'année passé il a fait bien plus sans xrapid et encore moins de régulation ! Moi je suis certain que toute la crypto dépendra du #G20
3781 2018-09-18 14:43:39 As much shit as I and everyone talks about $XRP. It’s been a solid performer the last year or two for me.
3782 2018-09-18 14:43:36 あ、大丈夫っす…。
3783 2018-09-18 14:43:32 So TA aside, what was the reason for this massive of a spike? Big players doing a pump? Anyone know? #XRP $XRP
3784 2018-09-18 14:43:30 Would be funny if launch of X-Rapid was the catalyst we where looking for, for a market reversal! #xrp #btc #crypto

3786 2018-09-18 14:42:50 That's why I like to invest my limited amounts of $crypto in projects that are most likely to actually build things. Hell if I know how to do it myself, but I can invest in teams of builders who do.
3787 2018-09-18 14:42:42 I get quite big part of my income using crypto, and for me choosing the right project is very meaningful. Trust me, this project in indeed that good! Best thing I've ever tried! #BitSong #Blockchain #Music @bitsongofficial
3788 2018-09-18 14:42:41 If touch 6300. It can do correction but all the same it will go up again because that target means bullish signal. For example if this week touch 6300 maybe back down 4500 5000 but will go up again.
But if hit 6300.if not?
Bearish continue.

3835 2018-09-18 14:38:12 I agree, current growth drivers behind crypto are entirely macro independent. E.g. value absorption channel which is, and will be imo, the main driver for the years to come. A lot of building necessary before fundamental demand drivers form and correlations increase

If businesses/banks end up buying it as an actual store of value, then there eventually could be some tremendous upside

3875 2018-09-18 14:33:38 Stocks represent a share of a company, something concrete that creates value for an economy. Currency is a medium of exchange which is very different. The crypto boom was pure speculation and in those instances somebody’s win is somebody else’s loss.

3904 2018-09-18 14:31:17 To be fair to @ToneVays  always says if you are not trading just holding it is always a good time to buy BTC.  As for his views on alt's he is a maximalist google the definition. For him to have any other view on alt's would be disingenuous.

3906 2018-09-18 14:30:48 Say Erkan, a quick stroll through your timeline seems to show that you’re using the MAGA movement to shill for crypto. Not one original post about @realDonaldTrump? Not even retweets? Just train hopping to grow your followers?

Dude. Explain.

Asking for a friend.

3911 2018-09-18 14:30:12 Not that it has any relevance
3912 2018-09-18 14:29:57 Ah, ok. You mean the Bank for International settlements, right? I’m not sure why they would not allow this. I get why they are against bitcoin. But if it’s a central bank issued crypto i don’t see a major issue
3913 2018-09-18 14:29:37 Trexの低Sat銘柄、懐かしい。

3918 2018-09-18 14:29:06 I wouldn’t be wasting all my time with you degenerates on twitter, a platform I only even joined for crypto, if I didn’t firmly believe it would. 
3919 2018-09-18 14:29:04 Ahh.  The marketcap argument.  So because XRP has a massive supply with most of the coins held by execs, it should get preference over actual decentralized projects?   Lol.  The XRP army may gave the most brainwashed cult of fanboys in crypto.
3920 2018-09-18 14:28:58 And it STILL does have the RISK. The one thing people don't see is novelty effects. Crypto kitties was HUGE once. Memo/block/matter are a novelty and won't replace Twitter. Same with tokenization, 1k+ active, ton already dead & many on deaths door. They must have purpose to exist

3929 2018-09-18 14:27:51 I have at least 19 "good bets" and so far can't narrow down. Especially to 2. But to repeat ETH success it should be something currently very cheap with good use potential (even if in crypto only) and perspective to go up to at least $1-2k. $WAN? $ICX? $ONT? $ELA? $QKC?

3941 2018-09-18 14:26:12 RSI is historically over bought right now. Only other time 4 hour touched 90 was the all time high. And 1 hour hit 92 today. May continue up, but needs a pullback first.

4025 2018-09-18 14:16:05 Blockchain stuff is the future! Everything yours will be yours forever, including rubbish. While your life will be consumed by the growing trash mountain you have to take everywhere that makes simple tasks near impossible, you'll be king of that mountain. It's the crypto dream

4038 2018-09-18 14:15:00 Sure, I think that the chart and news combined caused the pump today. That said, if BTC dumps again, XRP will not be immune. BTC is really all that matters.

Certainly, if that article is factually accurate (which I don't doubt), then any claim of crypto "saving" .ve is false.

4045 2018-09-18 14:14:11 Most #crypto traders on Twitter just want to be rich from a #shitcoin pump.

They don’t want to do any work.

This is exactly why they will fail to become rich (unless they get lucky).

All the things in life worth achieving and building require lots of work. 

Don’t be fooled.
4046 2018-09-18 14:14:07 @kevinmitnick I noticed a few grammar mistakes, in the phishing email, also the emails were sent from an iPad. Would those be tiny red flags for employees not to get duped? Last thing, $100 gift cards seem pricey for a business to give as gifts, isn't the amt too much aka bribe?

4051 2018-09-18 14:13:42 ETF has been setting prices for gold and silver for a while now and neither are priced fair to market demand because the etf are flooded with more contracts than existing underlying asset. In crypto any etf should be 100% backed and physical delivery.

4055 2018-09-18 14:13:29 my only concern about the crypto world is the $. It rules the world and it's the $ that won't want to lose any control.

The thing is, I think governments have probably already attempted to bring down BTC and failed.

4062 2018-09-18 14:12:59 That’s not a fair assessment.   Don’t misrepresent my article.  If anything, those who have used crypto have positively benefited from it.  Come on David, we already talked about this.

4108 2018-09-18 14:07:00 How will you be able to handle something like crypto kitty? There are several other like EOS that can handle 4000tps. I like ETC but unless you can scale it won't be used seriously for anything but ICO that lead to the same scan play as today.

4160 2018-09-18 14:00:21 #crypto #btc #bitcoin #cryptocurrency It is my belief that the financial institutions are naturally very unwilling to hand over power (wealth). Massive Blockchain implementation would mean a massive paradigm shift. What are your thoughts?

4166 2018-09-18 13:59:47 Some years from now all those friends who got persuaded into buying $crypto in the 2018 bear market now go back and realize how much it may have become.
4167 2018-09-18 13:59:46 Your coverage of crypto is like covering a kid's marble-versus-toy-soldier battle.

4171 2018-09-18 13:59:10 3/ Imagine if every influencer & blockchain dev was talking about bitcoin n working on it like in 2009-2015? Imagine how much faster bitcoin would gain mainstream adoption? Imagine folks coming into crypto n they see @jimmysong n @rogerkver debate... it was a total shit show!
4172 2018-09-18 13:59:10 Lol, that humble brag.
4173 2018-09-18 13:59:09 I started w/ $10K in Nov 2013, basically all my savings. I double/triple downed during the following bear market. 

I didn’t think crypto was a scam
4174 2018-09-18 13:59:07 It’s July 2023. Which person are you?

a) I’m still working the same 9-5 job, life is a little easier through a few 2-3% pay increases, I seem happy.

b) I’m in Hawaii and I can’t decide which colour jet ski will match my new 40ft yacht.

4218 2018-09-18 13:54:10 One less contentious reason why Wall St isn't fully on the #crypto train is analysts/associates are very busy with their existing coverage

4247 2018-09-18 13:50:15 have you forgotten that you can also buy other crypto for BTC?

4264 2018-09-18 13:48:29 More than likely a bank like Goldman. Banks knew crypto would be great by 2010 and probably have multiple wallets stashed away. They see a upcoming bull run and want to surpress it. Or they want a 100x on 700 million dollars lol

4266 2018-09-18 13:48:03 We're still so early in crypto. Think about it, this is when the mega rich (Bankers and Ceos, and big investors) are getting in. I'd rather be in now and wait however long I need to for the mainstream adoption. Similar to stocks like Amazon in the 90's at a few dollars/share

4378 2018-09-18 13:33:58 @aetrnty For many business applications it's crucial to have transactions which  are not recorded in public. Smart contracts executed in state channels  touch the blockchain only in the case of disagreement, acting like a  self-arbitrating crypto court.

4589 2018-09-18 13:09:40 そうですね。情報共有の場として徹底し、価格の話は関係ない為全てBAN。極端ですが、それならそれで筋は通っていると思います。しかし現在価格上昇のコメントは容認され、下落は一方的にBAN。これでは疑問を感じる意見が出るのも当然かと思います。
4590 2018-09-18 13:09:29 It's quite hard to function in the real world after being involved with Tezos or crypto in general. When you find entire new models to incentivize and profit through innovation its hard to go back to a one dimensional outlook.

4606 2018-09-18 13:07:21 I think there's a balance between being known & getting paid.  I'm a fan of Soundcloud as it shows reaction which is good for promotion, and of Spotify because it is used by non-musicians so I can get a wider base of listeners. Crypto music services still just used by musicians

4612 2018-09-18 13:06:45 They have no solid partnerships, I don't see the adoption of OCN in the sharing economy being successful, let alone getting any big partnerships. Why else do you think they made an exchange? A copy and pasted exchange may I add. But yes OCN is such a great investment.
4613 2018-09-18 13:06:43 As I said, it is still identical to the June fractal. Now you should recover 50% off that would be to 6360 and then end to 6160.

4662 2018-09-18 13:01:01 I agree to that as well. Waltonchain has had to many false partnerships though. They cost me a lot with their antics. I do like Golem though & to the statement user utility & business adoption is badly needed. Crypto needs people to step up & start showing ways to make this work.

4667 2018-09-18 13:00:10 Crypto is the ultimate game of conviction. Most of the best investment opportunities are non-obvious. They require independent thinking, discipline, and the courage to act alone. Those that do will be rewarded handsomely. -quoted from APompliano

4672 2018-09-18 12:59:51 Not sure. While I would love it to die honestly, I can't say it will happen soon. Crypto is more speculative than real use RN.

4676 2018-09-18 12:59:03 Technical analysis is a science, but often feels more like palmistry due to the chaotic nature of the markets, and the fact that the markets responds to predictions made about it. Doubly true in crypto.

4679 2018-09-18 12:58:27 It worked for nearly 9 years. It is what SN repeated over and over and it worked. CONSENSUS means agreement not competition. The only way that crypto can win against the REAL enemy(fiat) is compromise,togetherness, and a lot of concession

XRP and XTZ are not the same whatsoever and will exist in very different spheres of the crypto biome if you will.

4709 2018-09-18 12:55:21 Who would have thought that @Twitter will become such a huge direct reporting platform. You no longer need to be on public television to be heard. Your voice is for everyone to hear. Make it right

4712 2018-09-18 12:55:06 Disagree the losers help build the infrastructure and tech the winner will be using. If Bitcoin is stuck doing it itself then the winner will NOT be crypto,but the global fiat cash card that governments are working on,with the likes of visa/mc to track every cent spent worldwide.

4715 2018-09-18 12:54:53 Great tips. Have experimented with lots of different kinds of investments - funds, shares, p2p lending. Crypto was a bit of a rollercoaster, as was riding the train of AIM! Overall investing pays off. And the main lesson: never gamble with what you can’t afford to loose.

4717 2018-09-18 12:54:36 少なくとも自分はそこが楽しいとは思えません。ADKホルダーではありますが、あそこでたった2回、下落の話をしただけでBANされた段階で非常に残念な気持ちになりました。
