What would a 5-10 g/t grade do to the Pilbara stocks?  >10 g/t?

135 2018-05-16 22:04:50 I want booeing and biopharm stocks my old boss said that’s the way to go 
136 2018-05-16 22:04:48 Someone yesterday bought a lot of shares on the dip. BEFORE all the 13f where announced. Maybe someone with the initials G.S. might have loaded up on stocks also...just a thought...
137 2018-05-16 22:03:42 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close higher as retail leads.
138 2018-05-16 22:02:48 Forward grips can be removed.  Stocks can be changed rather easily.  Mag size is irrelevant.  By included that, they ban many pistols used by law enforcement.  That won't stand in court.  They allow pistol grips on pistols but not on rifles.  Explain that logic.

149 2018-05-16 21:54:18 @therealroseanne your show was spot on -it is happening  in upper class families as well. I took a low paying job under OBAMA  I had 2, Has great medical benefits. I have college degree & management background but u do what u have 2. I trade stocks 2 make up my lost income 4 now.
150 2018-05-16 21:53:32 But wait ain’t that unethical according to SEC stuff or it only becomes unethical if the amount of stocks is like a large ass amount lol empire got me rethinking !?
151 2018-05-16 21:50:51 That first sentence tells me you know near ZERO about investing. Bonds and stocks are not the same. Stay away from investing for your own good. Your tweet was the most ignorant I have every received. PERIOD.
152 2018-05-16 21:50:15 Market Close: MBS -17bps; DOW +62.52; NASDAQ +46.67; S&P 500 +11.01; 10yr Treasury 3.10%; Stocks shake off a little early turbulence and close in positive territory.  MBS drop further, while Yields continue to rise.
153 2018-05-16 21:49:55 And it was still a fundamentally neoliberal approach by a fundamentally neoliberal president. Investing in stocks doesn't extend the government's ability to make payments one iota. Maybe it would have bid up stock prices a little bit though.
154 2018-05-16 21:49:30 I think I will keep the stocks until earnings report on 23rd may .

156 2018-05-16 21:47:36 Past presidents sold their stocks before they took oath.
157 2018-05-16 21:46:51 If his actions as president effected the price of the stocks he bought,he committed a crime.
158 2018-05-16 21:46:41 Damn. What do you people think stocks are? They are a piece of capital. When you own a 401K or pension plan, you are an owner. You are a capitalist, *by definition*.
159 2018-05-16 21:46:35 Thanks appreciate your thoughts. I bought Lloyd’s / Centrica ages ago for Income in the days I largely focused only on Divi stats and not much else. Clearly any negatively is now smacking stocks hard at the moment
160 2018-05-16 21:46:03 Stocks prices absolutely do not have any direct impact on product prices. Stocks are a measure of how desirable a company is to have a part of.

162 2018-05-16 21:45:13 $M's Q1 beat and raise helped to push up a lot of retail stocks today, including $ASNA. I sold the $1.85 $ASNA shares @ $3.26 for a 76.2% gain, but have some higher-cost shares too; overall, still have a small loss on $ASNA.
163 2018-05-16 21:44:18 I agree they didn't want the US government investing in stocks, although gov pension programs already do this. Mostly because he was planning to spend the surplus on creating new social welfare benefits and expanding gov size instead of tax cuts (which is what W ultimately did).
164 2018-05-16 21:44:01 If market will bear it of course it is sustainable. If people don’t like the wage they’re  being paid find a new job. What percent of CEOs salary is based on stocks vs salary?

186 2018-05-16 21:33:15 obviously I have no background information. Obviously if he's been manipulating companies thru media and buying and selling stocks then it's illegal. but he's also the president, why does he need to trade stocks? It just adds to the list of questionable things he does.

197 2018-05-16 21:25:34 Yup, he is not stupid, his tweets about China and trade tariffs were done deliberately to make stocks go up and down while his friends made billions. I didn't think he would be crazy enough to buy them himself

201 2018-05-16 21:23:06 Initiated a $BK holding at 3% of single stocks, having gained some understanding of custodian banks. I like that they're not as dependent on loan income, since the lending business is prone to mismanagement and a hard place to outearn capital costs.

217 2018-05-16 21:13:56 Soon he busted unions, wages stagnated and the rich consolidated their gains by buying property + stocks. Money stopped flowing in the economy, pooling around those who already had a lot.

220 2018-05-16 21:11:23 You should always buy stocks based on cash flows, remember that.

273 2018-05-16 20:54:04 The corporate tax cuts were not helpful for job creation or significantly higher wages for most workers. Corp. tax cuts being used to buy back their own stocks & pay/ bonuses for CEOs. Corporate profits were already at highest in history BEFORE tax cuts yet wages stagnant.
274 2018-05-16 20:53:48 Investors have been focused recently on worries over rising inflation and interest rates pushing up borrowing costs, but some analysts expect strong earnings and economic data to buoy stocks moving forward.  WSJ

292 2018-05-16 20:46:47 When yields rise it means stocks are supposed to go down, bonds are low risk/low reward & stocks are high risk/high reward so when you see money flowing into a less risky asset class like treasuries the usual thinking is that investors are looking for a safe place to put their $

348 2018-05-16 20:14:48 I agree. My view is that most deep value stocks are best viewed not in terms of intrinsic value but rather in terms of expectations. Deep value stocks are those where expectations are extremely poor. So they tend to surprise over the short term.

399 2018-05-16 19:51:11 And others. Btw stocks are up what? 35% since Trump was elected. I guess they are stupid.

408 2018-05-16 19:47:01 WTF
409 2018-05-16 19:46:22 Investing in penny stocks is quite aggressive compared to the conventional blue stock long term holder method, but going agressive with penny stocks mean being delusional.

415 2018-05-16 19:44:32 He shouldn't be permitted to do so. Technically, it's insider knowledge or advance knowledge. Which means, he can make moves in or out of specific stocks, based on what he expects to happen. #Illegal

417 2018-05-16 19:42:49 Also you have buying and selling stocks while in office. I bet if you dig into that it will be in coordination with policies or tweets to drive certain markets/companies
418 2018-05-16 19:42:12 I remember Trump saying he owned no stocks.
419 2018-05-16 19:42:10 Start using Snapchat more, my stocks need y’all

436 2018-05-16 19:37:41 Why do people in crypto limit how they think. Do you really think market cap is all that will determine value of a coin for forever. No matter what you invest in.

440 2018-05-16 19:34:11 Banning bump stocks is a compromise. It's symbolic, more than anything. It's these kids begging you to give in on anything to show you care more about their lives than your guns and accessories.  It's such a tiny measure of good faith. Can't you see that?
441 2018-05-16 19:33:36 Did @BMO chief strategist just say he doesn’t buy stocks based on valuation on national tv?? What happened to long term, value investing? #flavouroffheday
442 2018-05-16 19:33:25 No one is trying to take away guns Charlie.  Smart common sense gun laws strengthen the 2nd Amendment.  Why wouldn’t you want this?  Proper background checks, ban bump stocks,  pass red flag laws, ban military style assault weapons, etc.. These steps protect current gun owners.

445 2018-05-16 19:31:51 Robinhood is the app where you buy the stocks I mentioned. You can sell them anytime you want but I recommend holding them cause the longer you hold them, the more they're worth. You do have to pay capital gains tax (about 15%), but only if you make a profit.

457 2018-05-16 19:26:05 @TuckerCarlson an AR15 with a bump stock fires 600 rounds per min if you the math thats 150 rounds every 15 seconds.

458 2018-05-16 19:25:55 1) Stocks are unchanged from the date I posted that.  

2) "Sustainably" - talk to me come late 3q18-early 4q18; we noted to our subscribers "the Fed would try to achieve it, & might even be successful for a little bit, but ultimately this will not be able to be sustained."

466 2018-05-16 19:22:13 There's no catch. You just have to make sure you invest in stocks that do well and I recommend you hold the stock long term (6+ months). I would recommend buying Square, Adobe, and Nvidia. They've all been up 70+ percent in the past year.

505 2018-05-16 18:59:09 So you agree we can ban bump-stocks & 150 round mags.  That's good.  Now how about 100 round mags?  Do you have any use for a 100 round mag?  How about 50?  You said most are 20 or 30 rounds, so how about we agree, 30 should be the max?  Deal?

515 2018-05-16 18:54:19 Trump buying and selling stocks instantly suspect. He could be setting up tweets (like those aimed at Amazon) to manipulate the stock market.  He should be investigated. He would do that. No doubt about it. Not to mention his new China-  Indonesian "deal".   @FBI @RWPUSA
516 2018-05-16 18:54:17 What I don't really get are things like the best stocks that have done well on that particular day over time & short the opposite.  I thought that had something like a 7 t-stat.
517 2018-05-16 18:53:40 Yep, it’s from resource investor @RealRickRule from Sprott Holdings. I was paraphrasing him and adapting it to ICOs... he used to say it all the time in interviews about penny stocks.
518 2018-05-16 18:53:11 They used to ban semi auto rifles with certain aesthetics that didn’t impact the shooting rate.

If the mkt does it's job of sorting out s&d through spreads & basis, what difference does it make what the numbers actually are? If we changed quarterly stocks to monthly (e.g Cattle on Feed), based on data, so be it.

674 2018-05-16 17:37:42 Wealthy spend their extra wealth bidding up asset prices (real  estate, stocks, politicians, etc).  Gotta stop that bubbly nonsense.  Gotta tax them a lot more anyway, UBI  or no UBI.
675 2018-05-16 17:37:24 A lot of apparel / retail #stocks are performing good today. Look at $GOOS or $LULU. Printing new all-time highs.
676 2018-05-16 17:37:04 Defense stocks love the threat of nuclear war
677 2018-05-16 17:36:58 it's perfectly reasonable to expect that most people will be unwilling to accept that interest rates are moving higher and related effects on dividend stocks, mortgages, real estate and bonds given the 35 year downtrend that just happened
678 2018-05-16 17:36:24 Oh I'm not worried about the 2nd amendment.  It will never ever be taken away. Let em ban bump stocks. They will never be able to take away everyones guns.
679 2018-05-16 17:35:55 How does that even work Sven?  Imminent UK recession yet somehow stocks are undervalued at their all time highs

683 2018-05-16 17:34:02 It is important that you don't buy too much when investing in gold. Gold doesn't provide you with any income, unlike buying stocks or bonds.
684 2018-05-16 17:33:32 A year later we had a 7th rounder with a year under his belt and a big investment in a 1st rounder they wanted to start.
You sound like someone that would hold on to stocks a year to long then complain that you aren't getting peak prices.   In the real world, you snooze you lose
685 2018-05-16 17:33:18 Those who are happy seeing nifty rally just chk the prices of most of the stocks touching 2008 levels..rally is not a reason to be happy. You have been given Jumla ideally.
You should be worried abt you bleeding portfolio. Useless rally to dump.

688 2018-05-16 17:29:34 Obviously as someone who owns multiple guns I have no issue with gun ownership. 

Your previous response/ attack implied that any gun law would be a violation of your freedoms. You do support some restrictions, that’s good. I do too. Like banning bump stocks.

695 2018-05-16 17:27:17 I've seen far too many newbies be too aggressive with penny stocks, making fun of my cowardly/safe trading just before they blow up and learn the hard way that you cannot cheat your way to success, it takes time & education FIRST #ignoremestyourownrisk #marathonnotasprint

701 2018-05-16 17:22:08 You have a  Dmat account and you know how to buy and sell , but why the good stocks not in the account. Just because of too much noise and too much intake of advices. Self analysis self learning is more important in the capital game.

704 2018-05-16 17:21:44 Bullish for stocks if true.
705 2018-05-16 17:21:26 Miserly.  Somewhat frugal.  Don’t like paying 10’s of thousands on taxes.  Those states mentioned I would pay no taxes. Stocks, companies, oil wells, etc give me a large writeoff.  States were the problem.  Hate paying taxes twice.
706 2018-05-16 17:20:48 Bump stocks suck for accuracy. It doesn’t turn the gun into an m-16.

719 2018-05-16 17:15:10 This would have some validity if 1) Slide Fire were the only bumpstock manufacturer with a stock capable of giving a 600+ rpm rate of fire to an AR15, 2) their stocks would disappear from the market when they stop making them and 3) bumpfiring without a bumpstock were impossible.

723 2018-05-16 17:13:06 How many guns he used?  Approx 10 & perhaps some of those did jam. Based on legal purchases of AR15's & bump-stocks, he was able to kill 59 & wound over 400 more.  WhoTF cares if a few of those jammed? Certainly not those killed.
724 2018-05-16 17:12:31 Nice Narrative.

Too bad it does not reveal the whole picture

The #GOPTaxScam gave huge permanent tax cuts to corps without requiring they use a percentage of tax savings to increase wages or jobs

Corps bought back stocks & paid shareholders

American workers got screwed

746 2018-05-16 16:59:20 Is that through mutual funds/index, or actual direct stocks?
747 2018-05-16 16:59:20 I have seen just as bad or worse with alcohol sadly Immie. Oil and mining stocks are another worry area but I go on valuations. However, I draw the line at animal testing where they have no choice.
748 2018-05-16 16:59:09 What's the better investment?  stocks, bonds, 401K, Sugar Daddy, crypo, lottery tickets?
749 2018-05-16 16:58:36 You're a bit carried away here and "over-interpreting" my twee - we can go lower to test the 50-dmas on the indexes depending on how far leading stocks pull into areas of support...what the $TNX does is just a sideline...but it was enuff to bring the market in yesterday...

- Tax cuts passed: 83% of benefits go to wealthy. 
- Unemployment is at historic lows: wages are stagnant, 66% of American earn < 40K a year.
771 2018-05-16 16:45:57 I'm going to assume the newly minted chatroom goes something like this: list as many volatile stocks as you can on your watchlist then if one runs claim it! If none run, then just pick a stock off today's biggest gainers list, and claim you were in it. It's a win-win.

At 400r's/min, it shoots 6.67/sec or 150 in 23 secs. Largest mag is 100 rounds, so it would take 2 mags. Perhaps he was off by 10 secs. Fuck the NRA

1044 2018-05-16 14:35:26 Because you gotta live a little! It's easy for me to get obsessed with buying stocks with all my extra cash, but have to remind myself to enjoy life while I'm young too. No guarantee that I'll be here when I'm 60 to have fun with my millions.

1049 2018-05-16 14:34:24 because you can get "high" volumes with little buying power (spending money.) Having a high volume is how you make or break. 

Like if you have 100 shares and your stocks goes up 1 cent, you've gotten back $1 but if you only buy 1 share of a expensive stock, if it goes up 1 cent-

1083 2018-05-16 14:25:59 It’s been getting better ever since Obama rescued us from another depression. Jobs/stocks continue to improve but not remarkably so.

Create spaces where ideas collide and mingle. Build the flows and the stocks of knowleodge. Focus on interactions, not processes

Build lots of fire to experiment to see what scales and works

Seek always outcomes
1085 2018-05-16 14:25:12 Of course I did. There is a pattern here, and all these stocks were due to get hit by the POS shorts. Between Adam F and Doyle there are plenty of high profile hit artists always looking to destroy the company.

within EU to 9.1 MMT,+0.2 MMT.
Thus, FranceAgriMer cut its forecast of French 2017/18 soft wheat ending stocks to 2.5 MMT from 2.7 MMT last month.
1161 2018-05-16 13:58:03 @realDonaldTrump Its clear from this China business deal that a whole bunch of Democrats really really do not like you.

How do you put real estate investments into a trust so that it reverts to you when you leave the presidency?

Build a portfolio of sleeves using each approach?  Less bias.  

Build a portfolio that combines the signals and pick stocks that rank highest on combined score?  Higher bias.

That’s my interpretation at least.

1222 2018-05-16 13:34:53 I just think back to how difficult 2008 was.  Everyone thinks -57% top to bottom that it was a cakewalk shorting stocks and man I’ve never ever seen anything more difficult than that market.
1223 2018-05-16 13:34:30 Stocks opened little changed on #Wednesday as Wall Street digested a surge that sent interest rates to fresh multiyear highs. Macy's shares, however, bucked the trend after the retailer reported quarterly.

1226 2018-05-16 13:32:27 Everyone thinks they will buy -50% down. I thought the same in 2008. But the fear and propaganda from MSM is so intense that when you decide to do it, stocks are already up 50% and MSM starts talking about another bear market and so on and I say to everyone, this is the truth.
1227 2018-05-16 13:32:16 As if that’s not enough, short-term bond yields have been rising, oil and gasoline prices are hovering around multi-year highs, and stocks have been volatile. Major indexes, which had been on a winning streak of late, finished Tuesday 5.6% below their record highs.

1282 2018-05-16 13:01:55 But the analyst can also choose to rank stocks on each of the 5 signals and sum the ranks. There are several directions he can take from there, with different “bias” implications.
1283 2018-05-16 13:01:40 The method that introduces the most bias is the sequential sort method I described above, because this method fully isolates stocks on a series of conditions.

1287 2018-05-16 12:59:59 Thanks but WTF.  Your post says that someone had to call the police about something - we are only mean to be discussing stocks!!  It is easier to say something nasty when we are not face to face.  It is also harder to interpret the intention when we are not not face to face.
1288 2018-05-16 12:59:50 That is a ridiculous argument. Banning bump stocks not only makes it mor difficult for people to get them but it sends a clear message that we are taking the US problem with mass murders seriously. It's time...no more NRA rhetoric.

1410 2018-05-16 11:30:39 @mrmuse I know you like  penny stocks, but look  at @symantec $SYMC.   I bough $0.77 options for October 2018 for buying shares at $24.  They're up  100% or so now, and I expect they will go up as  recovers from 35% drop from $30-$19, we may see some dipping after recovering 15%

The yield on the 10-Year Treasury hit a 7-yr high and broke a 37-yr downtrend indicating a 20+ yr uptrend in interest rates (and inflation) is beginning. Falling interest rates have acted as a tailwind for stocks since the early 1980's. $TY

1893 2018-05-16 03:53:40 Cyclical stocks are great wealth creator if you have the patience to Buy them at lower valuations & Hold them for years

1909 2018-05-16 03:44:53 How do you argue none of it went into housing/stocks. If the Fed didn't by MBS/bonds, rates would've been higher (that's why they did QE to keep rates low) & housing/bond prices would be much lower than they are today. Also. the low rates funded borrowing & stock buybacks.

1934 2018-05-16 03:30:17 Credit for it. Stocks tank its Obamas fault when there up its trump.

2004 2018-05-16 02:40:11 Honest question for @zerohedge ....have you ever done a positive headline or story on Tesla?  I mean, it has been one of the big growth story and value creating stocks in the last several years.  Was there ever a single positive headline or story in that time?  Seriously.

2006 2018-05-16 02:38:46 Not necessarily. I think rates could rise a bit further. But the more important point is that none of it really matters if you hold high quality bonds, stay patient and diversify with stocks.

2009 2018-05-16 02:37:56 But when people support BJP inspite of very high petrol price , rupee is at all time low, all mid cap stocks are heavily bleeding, heavy job loss you feel let country suffer. In democracy people will decide what they want, they want prosperity or poverty.

And by misappropriate, I mean “borrow” or embezzle to bet on wildly speculative funds/stocks in an effort to boost the company’s and/or their own portfolio a fraction of a percent.

2104 2018-05-16 01:34:35 Even with bump-stocks, you will not get that many rounds through the M16 copycat without melting the tube.  You do not even have 150 round mags... If he fired 150 rounds in 15 min, he must have used 2 weapons.

2118 2018-05-16 01:24:14 I have a stock portfolio, but it's handled by a firm set up through my credit union's financial advisor. I THINK there are a few specific stocks they look at and focus on those, but I'd need to find the booklet first.

2120 2018-05-16 01:20:49 You are a schmart man. It’s so difficult for many to be long stocks and cash. When I sold my house in 2009 I shoulda got long ES. Hindsight is very 20/20. I was so less educated then about the ramifications of QE and way too zero hedge oriented :-(

2135 2018-05-16 01:06:52 My dad is 63 and his only exposure to stocks is his 401k. Savings account but no other investment vehicles. Complains about low interest rate at his national bank but won’t open higher rate accounts at credit union thru me.
2136 2018-05-16 01:06:43 Who invests every month ? What stocks interest u
2137 2018-05-16 01:06:04 bump stocks were just banned recently (thankfully). it is nearly impossible for a single knife to do as much damage as an assault rifle, point blank. people have access to these things
2138 2018-05-16 01:04:37 Will gold bulls ever let it go? If gold can't rise with the current backdrop, it never will. Today stocks, bonds and gold all fell simultaneously. Nowhere to hide. Not even Bitcoin lol
2139 2018-05-16 01:03:42 As a petite size 6-8, I shouldn't have to pay the same as someone who's a plus size 18+. Plus sizes 1) use more material and labour. 2) need special designing to flatter the body as fat women vary more in shape, and 3) are niche like petite and tall fit, so stocks are low.
2140 2018-05-16 01:03:21 Yes I am. 
And so are my daughter and grandchildren.
And you know you are Shumerboomer.  Or do you get angry and say you wish you HADN'T EARNED so much on your investments (stocks, bonds, savings)?
2141 2018-05-16 01:03:02 I got 6 free stocks today lol its lit.....yall better claim yall free stock
2142 2018-05-16 01:01:50 I've looked some of those consumer related stocks, I'm not sure. I guess I'd want to see some daily continuation pattern like a sell setup find buyers to think it flipped trend. Maybe trying for that now. Lots of these really taken down a notch or two though.
2143 2018-05-16 01:00:30 I improve every time I pick a stock. This last one I bought is giving me a greater result than my previous stocks. Hopefully my next stock is even better
2144 2018-05-16 00:59:51 HODLing BTC, but what a crummy day. BTC, metals, stocks, bonds all down the same day!
2145 2018-05-16 00:59:49 Como lo quiero al Elder Stocks!!!!
2146 2018-05-16 00:57:01 @WallStFlex what stocks are you watching or looking to get in apart from CLF
2147 2018-05-16 00:56:30 so say earnings peaked in Q1 .  That means in rate of change terms that we slowing at the margin and thats all that matters for what we do here slinging stocks... even w/o a recession -- i been schooled by the best :)
2148 2018-05-16 00:56:27 If trump gets rid of Mueller, we must take to the streets to protest.  We must not spend 1 dime for gas, groceries, cars, clothing, stocks, house buying, entertainment, etc, till these corporations are brought to their knees & begging R's to get rid of trump.
2149 2018-05-16 00:55:44 So the spin from Republicans is look at the economy. Sure stocks up, corporations doing well with their tax cuts, and the wealthy are getting wealthier. What difference in the lives of most Americans? Try stagnant wages, higher cost of goods, higher medical costs, student debt...
2150 2018-05-16 00:55:28 #Stocks,#Indexes Advice for followers: FOLLOW THE MODELS, not me.  Shorting SPX at 2730, where the recent top signal completed, was obviously better than 2716.  When a signal completes, you act.
2151 2018-05-16 00:54:13 Bonds bring people together. Stocks drive them apart.

(I'm auditioning to write for the next Civilization game.)

2153 2018-05-16 00:52:51 - Asia stocks decline
- Investor concerns over trade, growth

2154 2018-05-16 00:52:41 I just want a lady friend to do nice things with and day trade stocks with! lol
2155 2018-05-16 00:52:11 Link show Asian stocks getting killed....
2156 2018-05-16 00:51:39 How many people heard about bump stocks before Las Vegas shooting ?
2157 2018-05-16 00:51:03 Quickest way to get out of FIAT and into #crypto??? I just liquidated some stocks and hangry for more coins...just worried by the time the funds clear on #coinbase I will have missed the impending pump @davidgokhshtein @blbtheman @XVGWhaleReal @crypto_baas @CryptoKaku
2158 2018-05-16 00:50:26 Absolutely agree. But the number of stocks which have created wealth are good in number 
2159 2018-05-16 00:49:54 Looks super good, but, I hope you know that you will single-handedly cause Kleenex stocks to skyrocket.
2160 2018-05-16 00:49:37 If you value practicality, you must realize that bump stocks, to my knowledge, have only been used in 1 mass shooting.  Outlawing them, will have a negligible effect at best.  It worries me when people try to enact legislation with no logical basis.
2161 2018-05-16 00:49:33 I’d rather buy income-producing assets before I risk my money watching stocks!
2162 2018-05-16 00:48:47 @FrankVelat Do you remember David Showers and Tuck Trentham? They both raced diet and asphalt latemodels in FL. David runs thunder stocks and street stocks now and Tuck is running street stocks  now
2163 2018-05-16 00:46:29 I have found that stocks crossing the important $10 level often rally another 10-30% fairly quickly...and sometimes much much more.
2164 2018-05-16 00:46:27 Wasn't there something with that Carl Icahn, when he was a Trump adviser who sold millions in steel stocks just before the tarrifs?
2165 2018-05-16 00:45:51 thats why i was short in RCAP ..& Anil bhai ke stocks main stop loss to jaroori hai..kabhi bhi aiwe hi jump kar jaate hain..
2166 2018-05-16 00:44:15 Are you for banning AR-15s, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, age retrictions....? If you say yes to any one of these them you are for taking away everyone's rights under the 2A!
2167 2018-05-16 00:43:31 Hi, sorry, I might be being dumb, but this information leaves me not that much clearer on whether there is a present risk to Bluenose stocks and we SHOULDN'T buy it, or it's ok and it's a good choice to purchase.
2168 2018-05-16 00:40:41 Even if it’s too much, I’ll get it with zero-interest discount
Stocks and gambling, I don’t wanna do things like that

2169 2018-05-16 00:40:29 Sir, see the del %, very high someone is accumulating, plus it has corrected more than its valualation which is 70, for good candidate for 30-40% upside, ur views pls
2170 2018-05-16 00:40:05 @TrumpFrolicker @PeopleEthe @zyd165 Lol. I wld like to see them in stocks in public square-make them watch Fox 24/7
2171 2018-05-16 00:38:54 ULTIMO MOMENTO !
Las mercerías trabajarán toda la noche hasta agotar sus stocks.
Cientos de "especialistas" salieron a buscar hilo de calidad para coserse el orto.

2172 2018-05-16 00:37:29 No civilian needs bump stocks let alone an assault rifle.
2173 2018-05-16 00:35:31 What is going on?  I have clicked on the link associated with this particular article, but I get an article about Asian stocks falling rather than the article about the drug dealer
2174 2018-05-16 00:34:29 This is exactly what is wrong with the leftist gun argument. None of you know a damn thing about what you want to legislate away. Newsflash: Trump already did away with bump stocks (Obama legalized them 3 times) and “assault” is a verb, not a noun. No such thing as assault rifle.
2175 2018-05-16 00:31:52 @stillgray you should really check your facts. Your article on ar 15s dis-claiming Tribes claim of 10 rounds a second is TRUE. Im guessing with all your fact checking resources and the love of the NRA that you failed to account for rifle modifications! Bump stocks and trigger mod
2176 2018-05-16 00:31:34 You do just tech stocks?
2177 2018-05-16 00:31:34 Aussie stocks higher in early trade with no banks ex-div. #ASX 200 +14pts or +0.25% to 6112. Most sectors lifting. Telcos remain under pressure as $TLS down 0.5% following Monday's profit warning #ausbiz
2178 2018-05-16 00:30:57 I may not be killing it like the end of the year BUT. I have had absolutely zero days of stress trades this year (stocks). It has become more of a position style trading year. Obviously when things go nuts, I trade much more, but 2018 has been all about sizing and letting it work
2179 2018-05-16 00:30:55 I'm 25, own my own home, have a degree, a job, a steady income, savings, own my own truck, stocks, a clean bill of health, a dog, a gym membership, and freedom.  What is "grown up" about giving that up for a woman?
2180 2018-05-16 00:27:04 @TAGRtrades your interview on chat with traders is  awesome for someone like me getting into penny stocks. Thank you for being real
2181 2018-05-16 00:26:45 I mean. My ideals might not be perfect but there’s always room for improvement. Oliver however will be put in the stocks. Country wide tour with fat kids throwing starburst at him.
2182 2018-05-16 00:26:42 @TuckerCarlson  Loved your show tonight.   Right on target with that clown that was so confused about bump stocks
2183 2018-05-16 00:26:19 He will do it on the backs of the poor and middle class and before Doug Ford finishes Hydro would be privatized.  All he cares about is how much money his stocks can bring him and how to take care of his rich friends. He owns a Corporation. Vote NO to Doug Ford.
2184 2018-05-16 00:25:58 David Loeb is an exception among notable value investors. Loeb has delivered returns like a growth investor in the last two years. His trick is simply to follow the market and not afraid of buying momentum #FANG stocks. $BABA $FB $GOOGL $NFLX are still among his top 10 holdings.
2185 2018-05-16 00:25:53 I do options and stocks. My main strength is stock and now learning about options. Follow the #Swinghomework here or in ST and the YouTube channel to see my Calls, I'm not an expert just a guy with an opinion who likes to study. Welcome to the gang. Gl
2186 2018-05-16 00:25:09 What apps or softwares you use to see all these stocks? In the charts 
2187 2018-05-16 00:24:36 Can you all see what is going on here .Botox + complete makeover = she is being groomed to take the Leadership when they Knife Turnbull. It`s so obvious its laughable.rushing downer back to bolster the Female stocks. Tell me I`m wrong
2188 2018-05-16 00:24:35 ???  "Asian stocks fell"..?.. different story than lead in..
2189 2018-05-16 00:23:59 No they are not! In some places bump stocks are, but the AR's are not banned. Do your homework. #TuckerCarlsonTonight
2190 2018-05-16 00:23:44 Made Asian stocks drop????
2191 2018-05-16 00:22:07 Talked to a dude today who said he was a Self starter and makes money trading stocks w/ money his parents gave him....get outta here lol

2195 2018-05-16 00:15:59 Stocks are at an all time high because more sponsors are coming on board because of pg era. Watch them go back to something more aggressive and go back to the pg13 rating and stocks will plummet

2198 2018-05-16 00:09:56 Connecticut legislators have voted in favor of a bill that would ban bump stocks. "I have yet to hear one legitimate reason why anyone needs to own a device that can fire 90 bullets every 10 seconds," Gov. Daniel Malloy said in a statement. Malloy plans to sign the bill into law.

2203 2018-05-16 00:03:10 @1776Stonewall I saw your poll about torturing terrorists. I also think they should bring back public executions, stocks, guillotine. Not just for terrorist, but for violent domestic criminals too. Criminals are emboldened by lack of force and weak punishments.
2204 2018-05-16 00:02:57 Ban assault rifles and bump stocks!
2205 2018-05-16 00:02:50 Few, if any, can accurately predict the #market over time and history does not show us the exact future, but chances are high that the US #stocks will be higher long term (not all but the index in general). One component we teach clients is that risk is relative to time.(cont.)
2206 2018-05-16 00:02:02 Thanks, @ManvilleP, but I don't want a book on point & figure charting.  I want the equivalent of Fama & French's landmark 1992 study showing superior performance of high book/market stocks.  Anybody know of that for TA?
