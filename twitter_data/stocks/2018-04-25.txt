36 2018-04-25 23:41:11 Dude NRA themselves have advocated that bump stocks should not be legal, ar15 is no diff than many other rifles, our founding fathers had guns that shot multiple rounds per minute, they did not limit what one could own.  The feds and police have not been doing their job well

43 2018-04-25 23:37:36 Facebook stocks jumped today by 5% after posting $4.99 billion in quarterly profits.  The users were annoyed but the advertisers flocked to Facebook after the Cambridge scandal hearings.
44 2018-04-25 23:35:19 Of course they are, but in the same way we shouldn’t be ripping 9 month old fetuses out, there is no need for AR-15’s boosted with bump stocks, or individuals with atomic bombs. There are clear limits
45 2018-04-25 23:34:38 Let me go check my Twitter stocks. Hopefully Kanye’s tweets made me more money!
46 2018-04-25 23:34:20 Started to buy back stocks so that the higher up and middle management will make a killing. It’s all market manipulation and you can only make money if you have a certain amount of disposable income. Giving a small tax break that goes away in a few years nulls itself out

81 2018-04-25 22:59:18 No the economy is never a sure thing, but a president who maliciously causes stocks to rise or fall because he opened his mouth is very dangerous for the economy.  He's made the stock market extremely predictable with his manipulation and that in itself is dangerous.
82 2018-04-25 22:59:03 Learn how to trade stocks and in a couple years you’ll be able to eat Caviar for the rest of your life or go to college for 4 years, build up debt, hope to find a job and become apart of the rat race, choose wisely

84 2018-04-25 22:57:33 I had AMD stocks, quite a few of them, and sold them at their relative peak of $15 per share then it tanked since then. Nvidia has been doing well, and i wonder if AMD will catch up to nvidia #is6621
85 2018-04-25 22:57:17 No It’s not; a tax cut for businesss is for them to fill their coffers, buyback stocks, and swell their already burgeoning checkbooks.

88 2018-04-25 22:54:42 Rates hit record lows before stocks rebounded in 2002 and again in 2009. The 2003-07 rally was crushed when rates and stock prices both rose sharply(like 99/2000). Rates and prices took out the market in January. Rates matter most when stocks are super cheap and super expensive.
89 2018-04-25 22:54:40 And, yes, assault rifles and bump stocks should be banned.  If you need to kill deer and ducks with one, you’re cruel.  Again, the 2nd Amendment is not limitless no matter what the NRA tells you.  The Supreme Court says otherwise. :)

2) Buy only Dividend Stocks
3) Put money into a Roth IRA

108 2018-04-25 22:40:21 A private airline company drags a doctor out of his seat by his feet. Stocks plummet the next day. Government police officers kill unarmed people consistently and nothing happens.... We need those regulations to save us from those evil private companies.

Is there any truth about this dividend plan.

151 2018-04-25 22:02:17 Yeah I'm aware of true insider trading...but this is a little different. Not the same as stocks and the coins around them not quite the same as a for profit business...so can't be rolled up under same umbrella...will be deemed some type of "insider scheme"

252 2018-04-25 21:00:20 What quality is there? These creeps get in, vote themselves raises, legally buy stocks on insider tips where the rest of us would go to prison for it, just ask Martha Stewart. Politicians these days are a disgrace.
253 2018-04-25 20:59:35 The worst advice I was ever given was to NOT short sell penny stocks the first day they gap up. I’m so thankful I was self aware enough to see that this advice would’ve set me up for failure
254 2018-04-25 20:59:26 If the markets are strong, nobody tweeting crap every few minutes, investors will go back from bonds to stocks, that will lower bond yields and in turn lower interest rates. Since Trump has been in there is no stability in stock market, wonder why
255 2018-04-25 20:59:04 Again, RESPONSIBLE gun owners (like me) want common sense gun laws like background checks, magazine size limits, no bump stocks, waiting periods, training requirements, etc., to make everyone safer.  The effing NRA opposes these, breeds paranoia. STOP IT.  #NeverAgain #MSDStrong
256 2018-04-25 20:58:22 The top five stocks that fell today were $TRIP, $GE, $COF, $FCX, and $EW.
257 2018-04-25 20:57:56 Vitalik's worth is like any good CEO--no more, no less. Many stocks lose 10% when CEO dies. He's a good CEO because he's a combination of smart, knows gametheory&crypto&coding, has integrity, and is emotionally even-keeled.
258 2018-04-25 20:57:17 The top five stocks that gained today were $NSC, $ANTM, $IR, $HRB, and $RHI.

263 2018-04-25 20:52:54 Agreed. People always look for the get rich quick scheme, and blame others when they fail. Do your own research and you’ll have no one to blame but yourself. And if losing money in stocks is bad enough to make you curse out others, you shouldn’t be trading.
264 2018-04-25 20:52:01 I agree. I lost my chance to sell when it was $68 on the merger news... but still sticking with it as I think it is a solid company... as of now.. not sure what lies in future...
265 2018-04-25 20:51:51 I wonder if Mr Sessions owns any pot stocks ?

270 2018-04-25 20:49:32 Very wise words. I'm not voting for anyone who doesn't share my views on sensible gun control, universal background checks, ban on assault rifles and bump stocks. Period.

273 2018-04-25 20:48:32 5. You can build an AR yourself & customize ea part. Adjustable stock is better than fixed.  Adjusting for size and clothing makes for a more comfortable, safer experience yet grabbers hate adjustable stocks. Kids can shoot them.

278 2018-04-25 20:44:03 For decades, NRA has fought tooth & nail against:

- assault weapons ban
- regulating high-cap mags, bump stocks, other accessories
- minimum purchase age
- stronger mental health & background screening

Through lobbying & fear-mongering, they have created haven for mass shooters
279 2018-04-25 20:41:57 Thought for the day: If everyone sold their stocks like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and demanded cash are there enough $100 bills in circulation to meet the demand?
280 2018-04-25 20:41:27 What are you talking about? These earnings were based on $ prior to congress hearings. Wait until next quarter and quarter after that. Stocks are forward looking now backward

Anyone still think going to med school automatically makes you a good person?
288 2018-04-25 20:38:15 Products you use and their stocks? Pfizer, Proctor & Gamble, Kellogg, GM, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Dollar General, Southwest Airlines, Colgate? I no longer own these, but researching told when to buy or sell. My point is sometimes you find the Gem when it’s in front of your eyes.

299 2018-04-25 20:31:11 Would this have been the view last year too? The lesson then, that has already been learnt is that these stocks have gone up 2x to 5x already. Nothing lasts forever; even the best of them will falter, some will die. Don't have to be married to stocks.
300 2018-04-25 20:30:44 85% of Trump voters are college educared white males with $ invesed in the Stock Market. Stocks went up 200% under Trump. Who are the sheep?  You are. The question is about whether we should vote our wallets or ethics then. Right?
301 2018-04-25 20:30:28 again, you need to define cheap.  running 20% and being cheap aren't the same thing.  expensive stocks can get more expensive.  you're a CFA, dazzle me

304 2018-04-25 20:30:20 The most simplistic Neanderthal approach is make a list stocks gapping on earnings . Put sell stop at prev closing price and watch the reversal unfold . Just ask good folks $cat $twtr if this has any merit . Sometimes the easiest solutions are right in front of you
305 2018-04-25 20:29:46 Alerts going off on my phone about all these earnings beats must be earnings season. #stocks #investing

307 2018-04-25 20:29:01 The peak rate of $SPY EPS growth is highly likely to occur in 3Q 2018. That does not have to be the same time as peak in stocks. Above trend #earnings growth should persist well into 2019..2020? That far out anything is possible.
308 2018-04-25 20:28:49 This is why stocks will never grow organically because the value of them is always going to be tied to a companies earnings and/or geo political events. Bitcoin isn't tied to anything besides the number of users on its network which will continue to grow. Think deeper 
309 2018-04-25 20:28:35 Momentum, nice gains for these stocks lately: $EBIO $EYPT $I $PFIE $VICR

315 2018-04-25 20:26:12 $EYPT $CPRX $MNKD $CRMD... My stocks must be environmentally friendly because they are all going green. Nice trading day :) 
316 2018-04-25 20:24:25 World stocks ex-US decline: US +.2%; Europe -.8%. Investors should read nothing into today's US move. Likely bargain hunting after several down days. Earnings still likely to drive single-digit 2018 gains. 2019 different story, comparisons with 2018 earnings likely disappointing.
317 2018-04-25 20:24:21 Talk on the topic has subsided...but if you step back...Risk Parity funds have been forced to rebalance this week (selling both stocks and 10yr notes)
318 2018-04-25 20:23:52 In school we always played the game in business classes were you “bought” stocks with fake money and saw the returns. I always picked Boeing and never got much. Good to see I was taking the long view.

320 2018-04-25 20:23:19 The rallies (even and especially those I got caught in haha) are squeezes. The extent of the rally depends on how many short sided. No need at all for fresh money to chase stocks. Bulls can put the poms poms away.

328 2018-04-25 20:21:50 That's not how it works Ruffled. It will 100% stay at 2018 or later. They're not going to move their planned announcement date because of an investors meeting. And even if stocks drop, they will rise again when they announce the game. So that doesn't hurt them financially
329 2018-04-25 20:21:22 One thing is to become a cryptocurrency exchange, one another is to tokenize stocks. The article never states Nasdaq is going to tokenize stocks.

344 2018-04-25 20:14:39 People aren't in fiat/stocks for the smell of paper either.  They are both stores of wealth with the chance of increasing that wealth.  The differentiator between those and crypto is the tech and, so yes, we are here for the tech.....otherwise we would be in stocks...

417 2018-04-25 19:31:18 QUESTION TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE:

How do I go about buying stocks/shares in a company??
418 2018-04-25 19:30:18 If you're going to worry about short-term volatility, you're just not going to be able to buy the cheapest stocks. With the cheapest stocks, the outlooks are uncertain. -- Richard Pzena
419 2018-04-25 19:27:54 Mortgage rates edge higher. U.S. Stocks decline. Borrowing costs on the rise.
420 2018-04-25 19:26:51 Can i ask which ones I've loaded heavy on quite a few.. CVE, CJ, BTE, BIR, CR, PONY and BNP. I think the Nat Gas purchases long term will be mega winners. Green on all of them now so I will hold and see where WTI takes me. I lost alot chasing penny stocks so I went long energy
421 2018-04-25 19:25:42 It's easy to see no inflation if you choose to ignore things with inflating values (stocks, bonds, real estate)
422 2018-04-25 19:25:06 Initiated very small position $SNAP today at 14.45
423 2018-04-25 19:24:53 I be watching stocks like I have one. 
424 2018-04-25 19:24:37 Yeah, they can cash in some of those bonds and stocks they have been hiding.
425 2018-04-25 19:23:49 Reits better yield vehicles. Stocks could enjoy better capital appreciation. I rely on reits for my retirement budget!
426 2018-04-25 19:23:47 sec doesnt care that much about penny stocks, tggi would just pay a fine if it did something illegal lol
427 2018-04-25 19:23:33 You want to know something I think is a bit outdated? The Dow Jones Industrial Average, where people tend to use that as a measure of the economy. It's not anymore. The Nasdaq is a decent gage for tech stocks. The emphasis of the "Dow" is kinda ridiculous at this point in time
428 2018-04-25 19:22:11 I felt the same way until I saw the documentary The Armstrong Lie and man that dude is just genuinely such a narcissistic dickbag. Legalize PEDs But Put Lance Armstrong In The Stocks: that’s my official stance.
429 2018-04-25 19:22:08 Yeah, not creating jobs. Companies are buying back their stocks. You should read more.

433 2018-04-25 19:18:45 I'm excited for a world where ALL stocks are penny stocks. STOCKS ARE WORTHLESS UNLESS THEY USE THE BLOCKCHAIN!!! #TokenizeTheWorld
434 2018-04-25 19:18:32 @rhum01 Do u play energy stocks? I loaded heavy on CDN oil and gas through FEB and Mar.. Energy sector lagged all other sector last year when SPY and DOW exploded.. Where are those profits moving to? I had you chart BTE a while back.. it has broken well above the downtrend line
435 2018-04-25 19:14:36 That's the problem with people who want to offer financial advice. 9 times out of 10, they just want more investors in their pet projects so the stocks rise.
436 2018-04-25 19:14:17 Maybe ye cud discuss invasive conifers too when yer at it! At least Rhododendron look pretty and cheerful for a few months of the year and the dont poison our waterways and delete our fish stocks!
437 2018-04-25 19:13:17 @greg_bonnell it’s sad to see the end of House Money. For many, our interest is in real estate issues not stocks etc. Don’t need to wade through The Real Economy to get real estate info. Thank you @ team for House Money

439 2018-04-25 19:12:49 As @contrarianEPS pointed out his bet is on eco revival i.e. SBI, ICICI, L&T largely. If those stocks start performing as per FM expectations the fund will outperform. But the time taken has been very long so many are raising doubts rightly. Only time will prove the FM expertise.

442 2018-04-25 19:11:10 Mid-Day: Stocks reverse course, and trade in positive territory (DOW up around 100).  MBS is currently down 8bps and Yields sit at 3.02%.
443 2018-04-25 19:10:58 On the contrary, it looks real good. If you’re gambling useless shitcoins, SHIT like this is what you should expect... and get. This is standard procedure with penny stocks, FFS! You know how the old English proverb goes: “Play stupid games, get #REKT”
444 2018-04-25 19:10:32 Hi Mega Man. I think #uranium #stocks #investors are on "tenter hooks" today, waiting to see if #U3O8 Spot price takes its usual month-end dip.Holding steady at US$21/lb so far.  #Nuclear news remains strong with new & restarting reactors. #Russia sanctions still on table.
445 2018-04-25 19:09:39 I wish I’d learned about stocks like 3 years ago rather than 7 months ago.
446 2018-04-25 19:09:01 If Auto & FMCG stocks under-perform the Nifty Index in future due to stretched valuations , he might be proven right ( His funds have just 2% in both sectors) . .
447 2018-04-25 19:09:00 Another successful day of trading stocks.
448 2018-04-25 19:07:58 Looking forward to the #2018 #Q1 #earnings-release by #Amazon & #Microsoft on April 27th 2am Oman timing.

Both stocks have already dipped due to negative market speculations in addition to further pressure from the sector performance in general.
449 2018-04-25 19:07:51 3% being Digested by Stocks Just fine...
450 2018-04-25 19:05:44 The lesson of my story is that the Wolf of Wall Street is bullshit. There's no way Leo DiCaps did all that with penny stocks. I call bullshit.
451 2018-04-25 19:05:43 Bond market continues to suggest that buying stocks is how we should be erring right now imo

455 2018-04-25 19:03:15 Of COURSE she will!
456 2018-04-25 19:03:01 Energy names doing some decent catchup/bounce today and within past week or so. Many pot stocks and bitcoin related stocks still lagging or dipping unless you want to nickel and dime it until story is all over like the many pretender companies.

467 2018-04-25 18:56:48 I doubt we're having "so many bubbles." US stocks & low-grade stocks. Residential RE in some areas. Commercial RE, farm land, industrial land? Also, excess of investment over consumption will drive up asset prices - certainly at work now.
468 2018-04-25 18:56:42 Bump stocks and mods?

472 2018-04-25 18:54:45 Greg, I feel the same way. Just watching the bond market and how stocks are moving it seems by the day the central banks are losing control. No matter what they try they can't stop it. Watch the FAANG stocks and you can see that the level of manipulation there is insane.
473 2018-04-25 18:54:38 I bet those holders are very frustrated as they can't lock their massive profits
474 2018-04-25 18:54:30 • Stocks have fallen victim to any veteran u c today They put life on the Tour!
475 2018-04-25 18:54:28 Nearly nine years since the end of the Great Recession, average hourly wages is barely covering core inflation while healthcare & higher ed costs skyrocket. Meanwhile, those with stocks & real estate have more than recovered and just received a nice tax gift from the GOP.

492 2018-04-25 18:45:53 I agree that it's not on the scale of the last housing bubble - lightning doesn't strike the same place twice. It's similar to how stocks ran up until 2007, but never became as overvalued as during the Dot-com bubble. But they still crashed in 2008. I believe housing is similar.
493 2018-04-25 18:44:36 I think $gern is a stock to “buy”! Unless you just like watching stocks go up. 
494 2018-04-25 18:42:43 ok no problem. I remember 2-3 years ago you had an issue talking about the screening process you used to find undervalued stocks. Is there any way to learn more about your screening process today?

504 2018-04-25 18:37:01 Here's the pessimistic view on stocks.  Inflation becomes more apparent.  Interest rates keep rising (e.g. 2-yr, 10-yr Treasury yields).  Corporate earnings have been fabulous, but how long can that last?  At some point, inflation worsens even as corporate earnings fade.#maybe
505 2018-04-25 18:36:34 Ive used SL trading stocks, pain in the ass, chasing fracture sized earnings. Much better holding and accumulating over time, less headache and less selfdestruction.
506 2018-04-25 18:36:06 Would people like one-second stock market quotes for the 1000+ most popular stocks, pre, during and post-market hours every day, going forward?
507 2018-04-25 18:35:07 Not saying you are being less than honest but based on the Dow, and of course the risk factors of your specific stocks, I am guessing your gains from January 2017 to February 2018 was substantially more than the loss from Feb 2018 to date.
508 2018-04-25 18:35:00 For those that are not high risk takers. And are interested in some form of investing.

640 2018-04-25 17:31:21 @allstarcharts How about this scenario... rates & bonds flattening, tech leading with US and global stocks rising, USD rising, commodities and precious metals fall and retest their lows.
641 2018-04-25 17:30:42 I have been selling into todays rally - including defense stocks.
Even sold my last tranche of $AAPL, $BRK/B, $ATVI in my taxable account so .....

Short term trades only for now, doing ok w that.

Probably a buy indicator - lol

645 2018-04-25 17:28:21 Funny hearing @jimcramer talking negatively about #tobacco stocks $PM $MO but he’s always speaking positively about #alcohol stocks $STZ $BFB. So the alcohol industry isn’t making products that are killing their customers? Right. Just more media tobacco hypocrisy.

650 2018-04-25 17:27:25 @SEC_Enforcement to lack of skill, why not flip it, and make it a SEC rule? The typical investor w/o inside information is allowed ETFs, but banks/funds/daytrade must invest in stocks.  No volume!

653 2018-04-25 17:24:16 In terms of stocks I think Apple is a good buy right now. Having fallen 7.1% in price last week it is def on sale now, always a safe buy imo, entry at $164 today and predicting a rise to $180 again soon. #Apple #stockmarkets #BullMarket #TechNews #DowJones #BearMarket
654 2018-04-25 17:24:02 Always try to see how the price could go up, 

and how could it go down. 

Most of the people only do the first one. 

They end trapped in a bear trend, 

keeping looking for indications of a bull trend. #crypto #stocks
655 2018-04-25 17:23:14 Cool. Less money for the contributors to buy bump stocks and white supremacy gear.
656 2018-04-25 17:22:37 I’m busting ur chops .. too many Americans & cops are dying from gun violence and more guns are not the answer.. that’s why we no longer  have the wild Wild West mentality. We need stricter background checks, psychological testing and ban on assault weapons, AR15s and bump stocks

666 2018-04-25 17:16:12 Guys remember pivots are areas of directional bias momentum shift . They are not alerts . You have to remove the social media bs thinking . Stocks need to build off these pivots to set a new floor/ceiling . Social media has destroyed your thinking.

679 2018-04-25 17:11:50 Like investing in stocks, when we invite refugees to our country, we're taking a risk. We do it because we believe it is ultimately worth the reward. And it almost always is. Eastern Europeans, Somalis, Iraqis all contributed to American society and gave back. That's a good thing
680 2018-04-25 17:11:50 The Dow is trying hard to turn positive.  I think if and when it does, it can easily move a 100 points to the positive with the help of only a few stocks.  If it doesn't, will be an interesting last half hour of trading...chin up people!

689 2018-04-25 17:04:15 Yeah Interest rates have not even inverted yet.  Yahoo Finance just posted that bonds selling to just about over and bond prices won't move much lower.  Now that I think about that it is very bullish for stocks.

806 2018-04-25 16:15:53 most of the bags i have took a fairly decent hit on the dip, with the exception of some low caps staying strong/barely flinching. hindsight is 20/20 - it was obvious that a correction was bound to happen, especially with the US stocks plummeting and the myether hack

812 2018-04-25 16:13:23 Hi! I'm a baby in the real world and I want to start looking into investing into stocks.
The last time I learned about stocks, I was in 7th grade, 'gifted' class, and we had fake stockmarket teams. This was back when Sears merged with KMART, to give you guys a time reference.
813 2018-04-25 16:13:18 @realDonaldTrump I understand the banning of 'bump stocks', but giving one inch to the left is how they manage to 'take a mile'. Be careful and don't trust them...
814 2018-04-25 16:13:02 COLONIAL SOCIETY stocks slump
815 2018-04-25 16:12:01 All reasonable explanations. I don't include NGLs in the crude + product stocks used to determine C.I. except propane & polypropylene & it is only 4% of total stocks that I use.
816 2018-04-25 16:11:30 At least crypto gets a 5 day run, stocks get minutes.....
817 2018-04-25 16:11:28 How does equity markets react in the next 3 years after ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) or NIRP (negative interest rates policy)??

No one knows because we have never had that in history.

My guess...they won't react well especially growth stocks.

825 2018-04-25 16:08:57 So you take my sound and very wise argument and you reduce it to the maid picking stocks on the NYSE. Let her put her money in a mutual fund. Give her a list of funds and their ROIs from the last 10 years and let her distribute her funds. What is the issue with that?
826 2018-04-25 16:08:04 many stocks I look at are already in bear market.  Fundamentals are transitory.  If we aren't already in recession, it can't be far off.

832 2018-04-25 16:05:37 A long time ago in the late 1990’s I read a chart produced by Richard Maybury. Paul krugman argued that the fed creating money didn’t produce “inflation” & the low CPI & PPI proved it. Maybury included stocks & bonds in a price index & why not it just another thing buy it tracked

884 2018-04-25 15:33:09 The recent pullback has done little to cause my positions to trigger sell stops. I have only had 2 stocks hit a stop loss and my positions are profitable on balance from my purchase prices. However, today I did trim back some of my holdings to mitigate risk holding forward.

887 2018-04-25 15:31:53 hiding the true risk of stocks is a lie perpetuated by the investment advisors association, a lie a regular person looking for past type returns finds too easy to believe; this has been almost constant forever, not an indicator of bubble, and indication of painful crash ahead

910 2018-04-25 15:25:11 Any stock can keep going higher or lower, that's for sure. However, in some cases there are stocks that are deliberately manipulated. That is without any doubt in my mind. Bad entry/risk management is completely separate from my argument.
911 2018-04-25 15:24:36 The change in ownership of those stocks, is what it's going to give the last leg up.
912 2018-04-25 15:24:17 Lol you liking me wasn’t in the question in the first place. I stated that my personal opinion was it’s stupid. You doing all this for money. Just stack yo own bread  invest in some stocks. Prioritize other shit Why do they have to be gfs? Why can’t they be business partners?

914 2018-04-25 15:23:52 @GreatHobby I am an optimist also.  But when stocks are going down you short.  Picking bottoms has put many out of business.  I have seen it
915 2018-04-25 15:23:02 @WhiteHouse You’ve tweeted before that the “Second Amendment will never be repealed.” But that’s just what your bump stock regulations will effectively do! I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.

917 2018-04-25 15:22:42 @POTUS You’ve tweeted before that the “Second Amendment will never be repealed.” But that’s just what your bump stock regulations will effectively do! I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.
918 2018-04-25 15:22:34 that i'm not sure ok.  
but think it is good advice to put less than 50% of your liquid net-worth in public stocks.
919 2018-04-25 15:22:27 @realDonaldTrump You’ve tweeted before that the “Second Amendment will never be repealed.” But that’s just what your bump stock regulations will effectively do! I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.

921 2018-04-25 15:21:34 As stocks are struggling with the notion of higher rates, the question of the day on @CNBC is whether 3% is too high an interest rate for 10-year Treasuries.  Good question.  I sure hope the Fed invested in a better crystal ball than the one they've used the past 100 years.
922 2018-04-25 15:21:10 I am holding mu and nvidia. Not sure if I want more chip stocks in portfolio. So I bought a little AMD this morning. It’s up 2%. I may sell it before the results.

926 2018-04-25 15:20:29 Well, the 'QE2' was on the stocks for a year before it was named after the launch. Beforehand it was known as 'Q4'. Maybe the new baby will be known as 'K5' until the christening. (Incidentally 'Q4' inspired several series for Spike Milligan in the 1960s.)

976 2018-04-25 15:02:22 My theory about the mkt never making it easy and patterns seemingly being established to cause pain when they are broken may well be close to coming to pass w/ some of the genuinely good earnings stocks. I.e. they may rally because too many short them. $SPX $NDX $IWM

1002 2018-04-25 14:48:53 Stocks are fighting back!: US stocks are undoing their losses and the Dow has gone from down some 200 odd ticks to looking like it's going to go green. That's helping to pull risk sentiment around and USDJPY is taking on the much watched daily cloud top at 109.30.

1008 2018-04-25 14:46:33 While eating one’s own cooking is a good practice - for management - rank n file should not hold (a lot of) stocks where they work for diversification purposes. In a downturn, not only their stock may go down, they might lose their jobs as well

1046 2018-04-25 14:36:19 Falcon is the character people who aren't good at the game play in order to inflate their egos to make themselves look better than they are by being able to take bullshit stocks or do "combos". Falcon is a shortcut.

1048 2018-04-25 14:35:29 #propane stocks were down 0.2 mil bbls to 35.7 and are 3.9 below year ago level of 39.7
1049 2018-04-25 14:35:13 Ok so then you're well aware of how invalid any win or close set with Falcon is simply by the nature of him taking any random stock by mashing buttons or even any random game since Falcon's weight gives him armor at low %s, and his hitboxes/blind combos give him free stocks.

1112 2018-04-25 14:22:42 I do not follow it. Generally, there is a value rotation in play, away from formerly well supported growth valuations, of which Twitter is associated. The question is opportunity. I see limited upside for entire tech sector, due to valuation adjustments. Great co's, lousy stocks.

1154 2018-04-25 14:11:49 copper stocks looking to head much lower, always a good indicator of economic sentiment direction. I think we are heading down a slippery slop! Bond yields rising, rate increase risk, etc. Hmm, lets see how $goog & $amzn earnings go!
1155 2018-04-25 14:11:30 Breaking cardinal rule. watching financial TV news. Hysterical how many people talk w such authority about stock #MKT which is great mass of chaos. Better to skip generalities focus on risks, and stocks and sectors.

1157 2018-04-25 14:10:49 Yes. Stocks down because stellar results were already baked in. That front-running thing.
1158 2018-04-25 14:10:16 If you are thinking crop failure in Safrinha corn, or being sold this idea 3 things:

1.  Amount of Brazil rain earlier this year and subsoil moisture

2.  Stocks, Real/USD, and their ability to hammer down on sales

3.  Corn yields can surprise in imperfect growing conditions
1159 2018-04-25 14:10:08 Scam. Billions of dollars we earned, you just gave away to the richest people in the country. They bought back their own stocks, but this company is adding 7 more people to minimum wage jobs, sometime, soon.

1167 2018-04-25 14:07:45 FWIW - Everyone is focused on how close stocks are to their 200 dma; no one is focused on how far away the 10 year from its 200 dma.

1169 2018-04-25 14:07:18 That's what they want you to believe. Whole point of manipulation is to dissuade people from investing in Gold and Silver. Herd the lambs for slaughter (into stocks) and force them out of their sanctuary (Precious metals). Time will tell all as it has in the past.

1178 2018-04-25 14:04:58 Point being that even if 5 yr CDA goes to 4%, which I believe is highly unlikely, yields on income stocks will still be very high vs bonds. Factor in favourable tax rate on dividends and stocks are even more attractive. Interest rate fears really overblown if you do a little math

1282 2018-04-25 13:25:28 Stocks and bond yields have historically risen together. While the adjustment to abrupt rate moves may bring more volatility short term, stocks and bond yields rise together over longer periods (>3 months) as we noted in this week's #WeeklyMarketCommentary.
1283 2018-04-25 13:24:35 Two different things: MPT is about risk/reward (read: volatility/reward) SWIW is about the long term efficacy of having anything other than stocks due to the real return issue of inflation. Nick would also add investor behavior trumps it all

1291 2018-04-25 13:20:25 RBC: "the more recent move up in rates over the past three months has actually seen the Utilities index rise as well, so perhaps the rising-rate effect on the sector has been priced in to the stocks."

1337 2018-04-25 12:57:15 #Stocks | I tend to think yields are going to keep rising in general, but with the break of 3 percent I still don’t think we are going to be at, say, 3.5 percent right away. A 10-year yield of about 3.2 percent at year-end is more reasonable. @NatWest_Help $DJIA $SPX $NDX $VIX

1409 2018-04-25 12:04:30 The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note swept further past the 3% If bond rates go up stocks tend to move down. The Fed does not want the economy to stop growing just not overheat. Rates have been extremely low, corporations benefited. 3% is still very modest.
1410 2018-04-25 12:04:10 However just now, stock futures erase earlier losses after blowout earnings from Boeing #stocks #bonds #commodities

1423 2018-04-25 12:00:25 Less fishing due to the need to conserve fish stocks is one of the reasons, along with fewer but larger boats that are more efficient and require smaller crews. Also fewer young people want to become fishers. All of this contributes to the decline in the UK fishing industry.

1499 2018-04-25 11:17:41 For all this talk that the even number of 3% "isn't the number" on the 10yr note, isn't it funny that yesterday when the yield even got close to 3% stocks sold off?
1500 2018-04-25 11:16:50 Well the truth is that in any 1 year, the biggest 1 year winners are often sourced from 'losing style' stocks... they can have lottery payoffs.  The labels don't say "Don't invest" they just say - be aware that it's more of a gamble.

1520 2018-04-25 11:04:03 $TWTR up 12% in premarket. If this holds it shows that we are in a transition phase where people suddenly start to like stocks like $TWTR and $SNAP for being less data reliant compared to the juggernauts $FB and $GOOGL. It hits the zeitgeist and a clear trend that I follow!
1521 2018-04-25 11:03:42 Be it stocks or funds, don’t keep chasing new ideas. If you’re sufficiently diversified, better to keep adding to the existing ones. 
 
To me, 9 to10 stocks are sufficient diversification.

Years of over fishing meant the stocks were dangerously low and the obvious way to resolve that is to fish less. Less fishing = less need for fishermen.

1546 2018-04-25 10:37:49 I apparently found out that it's not the Economy that produces "Moeshas" but rather some fat bellies who are forcing our ladies to trade their valuables for the stocks in their pockets which were somewhat candled by the wife's efforts 
1547 2018-04-25 10:37:38 I think, in short, we agree. I just dont want to sound hypocritical. I don't think gov entities, even the CDC, should be a political sideshow for a gun control (for or against ) narrative.  I believe in the 2A, strongly. Even was upset Sessions caved on bump stocks. the principal

UK fishing has been declining since 1914. These days larger boat with increased technology mean fewer boats and fishers are required. Management of fishing quotas has prevented fish stocks (i.e. cod) from collapsing.

Always buy #Stocks which are trading 20% above its 52 weeks low and closing #Price above 20% of 52 week low should be maintained for consecutive 3 days. Never buy a 52 week low stock till this criteria maintained.

2071 2018-04-25 03:06:24 Price and value are not aligned in the current market, perhaps that's why people are asking for the "real" one.

2072 2018-04-25 03:04:53 As this Cycle plays out, I fear stock mkt to lose 30-50% in U.S., “emerging markets investments” to be a b.s. buzzword that goes away as many default and stocks go down 50%+, various junk bond defaults in developed mkts, and crypto to have 100% losses.

2149 2018-04-25 01:58:50 Hi! I’m sorry to hear that you’re not able to redeem the complimentary PERi-PERi bottle sauce. The response from our members were very overwhelming and thus the stocks has ran out quicker than we thought. Can you please PM me to keep in touch about this?
2150 2018-04-25 01:53:21 I used to use suretrader and lost money so many times with failed orders or being rejected orders which is lethal for penny stocks, far too regularly for a paid service it was ridiculous. Ever since i started using tradezero i havn't had a single hiccup and free orders too
2151 2018-04-25 01:50:20 One of the best lessons learned in markets like today is not to force trades just to trade. Keep it simple and stick to your trading mechanics. #OptionsTrading #stocks

2153 2018-04-25 01:49:16 Can’t you do this for us: @AsaHutchinson On April 24, 2018, Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan signed legislation enabling judges to order people to temporarily give up their firearms, if they are found to pose an immediate danger. He also signed a bill banning bump stocks
2154 2018-04-25 01:47:32 I love my bump-stocks!

2170 2018-04-25 01:36:26 What was actually nasty was pushing stocks way too high last fall and into 2018
2171 2018-04-25 01:36:23 PS. By which I mean: if samples were from incident and #Assad didn't put it there, then someone else did. Or someone gave OPCW Assad Sarin not from site. Absolute proof impossible in a war zone. But solving the puzzle without acknowledging SOMEONE gave Govt stocks seems bizarre.

2174 2018-04-25 01:34:52 Context - very easy. Stocks got overvalued last fall and into 2018. We need to get back to 22K on the Dow to approach fair value with a treasuries at 3.0%. When names like 3M gets to around 18x 2019 revised estimates we will be there

2190 2018-04-25 01:17:59 US stocks fell sharply on Tuesday as the rise in the U.S. 10Y Treasury yield above 3% spooked equity investors. Yet, some analysts remained adamant that the slump in equities on the back of rising bond yields was somewhat of an overreaction.

2204 2018-04-25 01:07:01 If you’re a retail trader, you have absolutely no excuse for trading stocks or forex rather than crypto. None.
2205 2018-04-25 01:05:56 Nope. Just the volatility that creates opportunities. When you a buyer of stocks like we are.  You want the good ones cheaper. Trading has become very one sided. Or the other.
2206 2018-04-25 01:05:26 The smartest and wisest should prevail. If someone isn’t paying attention or stays in the market or the wrong assets too long, that’s not your fault. I also don’t think it means someone else is losing. Many stocks were manipulated with the buybacks. Some companies are at fault.

2212 2018-04-25 00:54:58 Funny, when I try to track those "clear records" down, they seem to evaporate. Assad stocks? Have you looked at the process by which they were destroyed? And you also need to look at motive and delivery mechanism.
2213 2018-04-25 00:53:45 As far as guns? Law that requires expanded background checks(including private sales), mental health screenings that need to be renewed, licensing and training requirements that need to be renewed, magazine cap restriction and banning bump stocks is a good base to build off of
2214 2018-04-25 00:53:39 So my timing is all about opportunity. Plus, I usually don't own a boatload of individual stocks anymore because I need a specific thesis and a valuation metric I'm comfortable with. I'd rather spend that mental energy elsewhere

While crypto can offer a hedge to the markets, it doesn't have a long enough track record to definitively say it is.

2273 2018-04-25 00:07:49 ALERT: 4 #PennyStocks I have my eyes on that will make any #TradingAnalyst hungry to long these #OTC money makers

$BYOC
$CELZ
$FRFS
$HEMP

These 4 are on my radar based on their #ChartPatterns, I believe a pop near on all of these #OTC stocks this year!

2278 2018-04-25 00:04:11 Not all are criminals... some are individuals with mental health issues. Either way, automatic guns and bump stocks should not be available to the masses, mental health screenings and a waiting period are imperative, and minimum age to buy should be 21.
2279 2018-04-25 00:02:41 For the US, stocks is minimum $25k, FOREX i believe is $5k.

You should typically have double the amount to get started. 

If you can make 2R over the course of 3 trades a week on a $25k account, that's about $1000 - $ 2000 a month.
