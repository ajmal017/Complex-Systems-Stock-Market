133 2018-06-26 15:31:20 Salvo los commodities los demás productos llevan meses de trabajo en inversión para empezar a exportar. Nosotros nunca dejamos de desarrollar el mercado externo. Aún con inflación siempre fue más rentable que el mercado interno.

153 2018-06-26 14:09:28 I love the fact that India prints the RRP directly on the commodities themselves. 
It helps you know which retailer is selling at an exaggerated markup.
154 2018-06-26 14:09:24 There is no 'zero value' bankruptcy liquidation type event with commodities. It will just slowly become irrelevant and a shadow of what it used to be

155 2018-06-26 14:08:27 Yes. These separations have been going on for a long time now. I believe children are being trafficked as commodities & sold to the highest bidders. It is probably being done by organizations under the guise of *Christianity* but is kidnapping and selling humans.
156 2018-06-26 14:07:31 This is a real question, not an attack: How do you envision the implementation of tariffs on steel or other commodities to free-up trade? I’m not sure I follow.
157 2018-06-26 14:03:31 Yes to so many mentioned here.  I'd also add Walter Johnson's *River of Dark Dreams*.  And a quick little primer on the Atlantic slave trade is my book *Captives as Commodities*.

162 2018-06-26 13:39:35 Why is it that so many WMDs, used by the UNITED STATES MILITARY, and built in other countries, is providing record profits in the 10s of billions of dollars, year after year after year for the MANUFACTURERS of those COMMODITIES?
163 2018-06-26 13:34:54 Firstly, the word “Defence” - if a weapon is pointed at you you don’t see it as defence. Besides you cannot see these weapons as mere commodities. There is a moral imperative to restrict the means of killing others
164 2018-06-26 13:30:18 Avoid gold and silver. They are a trap. Their time has not come. Commodities have just started up. We are at the beginning of a major growth phase. Pull up monthly charts and ..buy. Monthly charts never lie. No one can tweak or fake monthly charts not even the GS dick heads

167 2018-06-26 13:18:46 A lot more commodities are closing up shop.  Commodity inventory purchases are being limited with a "purely Fascist" purchasing program.  It is not "free enterprise" anymore.

Please we have suffered enough

230 2018-06-26 06:59:55 There is a need for more effective restrictions on #international #arms #Sales and on international purchases of commodities from ‘tainted’ sources. #ThisIsAmerica @iefsafrica
231 2018-06-26 06:55:04 Spending millions of taxpayers money over sea tour yet Garissa residents lacking basic & most essential  commodities , sad reality !
232 2018-06-26 06:51:23 In some countries it has been relatively easy in recent decades to exercise a kind of state power by purchasing military force with the proceeds of sales of valuable commodities on global markets. @iefsafrica

239 2018-06-26 06:05:53 #BharatBachao people have to control their movement due to inflated petrol prices of near and above 80 and pay more for all commodities as a result but our globe trotter is traveling world like Vasco di gama

242 2018-06-26 05:50:17 The BJP-led NDA government has failed to control the prices of petroleum products as well. The country is reeling under highest ever petrol and diesel prices.
Besides the petroleum products, the prices of other commodities are also hovering on the higher side.

247 2018-06-26 05:32:22 exports werent stable due to some intricate policy measures by PPP; there was a global commodities boom. however, PMLN's currency and tax policy directly hurt exports
248 2018-06-26 05:30:04 On the one hand, different agri. commodities were imported in bumper years. On the other hand, import duties for wheat were cut down to zero. These measures forced a sharp decline in farmers’ incomes since they had to slash prices to find buyers for their produce. 
#BharatBAchao
249 2018-06-26 05:22:30 It feels like this whole group has been purposely orchestrating policy, sentiment aka treason tweets, & market/stocks/commodities/etc to profit from. It feels like there is a huge joke on Main St. & they are laughing all the way to their off-shore bank accounts. C'mon justice!
250 2018-06-26 05:18:34 Bracket orders aren't available on commodities yet but on our list of things to offer. We'll keep you posted.
251 2018-06-26 05:02:26 1/2 Your protectionism is full of illusions. In fact it is made to make the people pay more. The same ppl you are claiming your policies. 
The GOVT is making money on tariffs and also on taxing the higher priced commodities. At the end govt wins - people loses.

254 2018-06-26 04:57:05 Absolutely. This is about  the systematic dehumanization of an entire population where children are seen as no more as expendable  commodities of the process.If this was happening to anyone else,anywhere else there would be an international outcry against the injustice of it all!
255 2018-06-26 04:56:22 No worries though! President Trump ranks 3rd all time in 1st year. In Lumber and Textile commodities.. The true indicators of a strong economy. Eisenhower,and Reagan are the only ones who ranked higher.

258 2018-06-26 04:44:38 Merriam-Webster's Word of the day: kaput. "Our societies are kaput because we use people as commodities." And at the same time, we are slipping deeper into an Orwellian nightmare. Still, I dream of a better tomorrow happening through our own actions #writingprompt #Orwellian

261 2018-06-26 04:18:20 Todos no Brasil preocupados com a alta nas taxas de juros nos EUA. Até faz sentido, mas como nossa #economia exporta #commodities, pode ser que essa subida dos #treasuries não seja tão ruim assim...
262 2018-06-26 04:07:06 RE-reading your Q. The point is that they’re getting market traction *without* significantly increased yuan use bc of gold convertibility. Yuan is acting like a perfect carry trade to buy gold (and other commodities). China devals yuan while gold bottoms...
263 2018-06-26 04:03:30 And Pray that people can still buy basic commodities. I was buying groceries last weekend, the price of rice has increased by 10 pesos per kilo.
264 2018-06-26 03:48:53 Não acho q é o fim do mundo essa bolha na china,mas acho que a próxima crise será desencadeada lá,e eles os chineses vão ter um ajuste forte, que vai puxar o mundo, mas não será o Apocalipse now.Vai ser foda, bem foda, especial pra gente que financia nosso deficts com commodities
265 2018-06-26 03:43:08 Nos resulta sorprendente encontrar tantos libros de historia dedicados a commodities que nos permiten ver cómo todo está conectado en el mundo... ¿Tan difícil es entender que así también funciona el tráfico de drogas?
266 2018-06-26 03:36:40 Instead of wasting your energy in  attacking your critics and maligning their beliefs, explain to people why China aircrafts are often seen in Davao.. why unemployment rates soar high, and increase in basic commodities are slowly killing the poor and marginalized.
267 2018-06-26 03:14:21 Food for thought?: 

"We grew up in a culture where treating animals as commodities is normalized, and even on the best farms in the country, we do things to hens and other animals that we wouldn't dream of doing to our cats or dogs, never mind other human beings."

271 2018-06-26 03:03:58 Deregulation was literally one of the key factors in the crisis. Brooksley Born warned about the lack of regulation in the 90s. Repealing Glass-Steagall and the Commodities Futures Modernization Act allowed Wall St to play fast & loose.
272 2018-06-26 03:00:05 Theoretically, they should be traded like commodities.  Let the market decide what they're worth and how they are distributed.  Govt's job is to regulate and tax.
273 2018-06-26 02:55:10 We are un the drivers seat, but yet we depend on China to keep recycling our debt in perpetuity? What happens if they decrease US debt purchases & instead buy commodities, land and oil?
274 2018-06-26 02:52:20 The conditions of most of our schools are shameful. State government spends millions on football (i.e. Terengganu spends an estimated MYR 30 million) every season, but real public commodities like schools are being left to rot in the gutters.
275 2018-06-26 02:49:30 If you are earning for family members in the PH, technically it still isn't good. Price of commodities and services also go up and PPP goes down.
276 2018-06-26 02:46:16 Wow. I think it is crucial for outlining the long term relative monetary value of things, commodities against currencies etc.  Without it we run the risk of 'money illusion', where we might think something is becoming more valuable when really the pricing mechanism is devaluing.

282 2018-06-26 02:04:17 O Problema é que a merda já foi feita há decadas e nao tem o que fazer: tem de deixar o mercado se corrigir,isto é, ter um crash, as empresas ruins falirem, o sistema se purgar, e se restaurar. Mas o QE alterou tudo que é taxa e bagunçou commodities, currencies, gold

289 2018-06-26 01:04:51 Because tangible commodities require labor to produce. Tangible commodities add value because they can be used and consumed by the population. Labor that that is used in the production of useful commodities is the source of value.

298 2018-06-26 00:18:45 Isn't it funny that the citizen acts as if they don't even miss the lower prices due to, as you stated, commodities not being taxed?

#taxationistheft
299 2018-06-26 00:17:17 I'm just confused about what tangible commodity they are producing. Insurance companies may pay other real production company laborers to produce commodities as restitution, but what tangible commodity is the company itself producing. I don't know the answer, that's why I ask.

301 2018-06-26 00:09:23 Typically production refers to the production of tangible commodities that are consumed by the population either for sustenance, or to maintain homeostasis or to improve standard of living. Through daily use, the commodity is eventually fully consumed and must be repurchased.
