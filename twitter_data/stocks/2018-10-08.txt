In stocks we know exactly what 2 hours we're going to get the momo.

Multi task some day trades, take cash positions each day, and monitor crypto too.

Best of both worlds.

76 2018-10-08 23:14:31 Modern zoning laws are just a cute form of redlining. They keep housing stocks artificially low and thus keep poorer people out. In CA, where property taxes can't even reflect property values, this is especially effective.
77 2018-10-08 23:14:07 All my tech stocks are in the red today, Ross—not just Tesla. Workday, for Chrisakes! I mean, none of it makes sense. But collectively there’s a downward trend in tech rn. I’m in it for the long haul, so eff it.
78 2018-10-08 23:13:42 I know it may seem like a dick move but it really isn't, I have seen low stocks and how we have to manage only we know,  we don't want to ban anyone, at the end of the day we have to best manage our resources. Maybe it's something you might want to get into and make a change.
79 2018-10-08 23:13:07 Any good shooter can teach you how to hold a riffle and get the exact same effect as if you had a bump stock in about 10 minutes.  Bump stocks are marketing toys for new shooters.

89 2018-10-08 23:05:55 If that was true wouldn’t corporations always buy back stocks? 

It’s tax cuts and reduced regulations that have led to higher stock prices and higher corporate profits.
90 2018-10-08 23:05:30 As of now yes. You can purchase ASX stocks through your broker but commissions are quite high. $NVA will spin out its #lithium property that will trade on the TSX Venture sometime soon.
91 2018-10-08 23:04:43 The ad writes itself. Split screen. On one side, all the unsung accomplishments (record minority employment, stocks, tax cuts, wage inc. etc) and on the other deranged democrats yelling impeachment/resistance even louder with every success.
92 2018-10-08 23:04:17 A cool thing about Melee design is that while both Marth and Sheik are (mostly) combo oriented characters, they are good at different points in the game. Marth has trouble closing out stocks at high percents, while sheik has trouble starting combos at low percents.
93 2018-10-08 23:03:32 We are trying desperately to increase blood stocks, as research gets better we understand these diseases better, we are making progress, it's slow I admit, where homosexuals couldn't donate at all, they can now. In the future it will get even better as we understand disease.

102 2018-10-08 22:57:33 Tim, if you dare to call Ed a highly paid troll, then surely you are a highly paid idiot. Banning Bump Stocks is not enough. In Australian education w use what your NRA is doing as an example of how NOT to do it. An App is nothing but a bandaid; you need to change your gun laws.

106 2018-10-08 22:55:37 These may be good stocks. But lots of examples recently that pv-10 is hardly money in the bank or a liquidation value. Besides the inherent geological uncertainty, the pv-10’s assume current cost structure.  Yet on a blowdown there are big diseconomies of scale. Net net, 1/2
107 2018-10-08 22:55:26 I just don’t get how you of all people could be recommending people time the housing market. Not trying to troll, just trying to understand. I’m way more hesitant to dump the 50k I have saved into stocks than I am into my 1st rental prop.

109 2018-10-08 22:54:15 Banning Bump Stocks is not enough. You guys need somebody who will really stand up to the madness that is your NRA and the weapons culture over there - it is utterly and totally ridiculous.  Here in Australia we use you as an example of what NOT to do.  Get real already.

128 2018-10-08 22:42:07 I personally would have no use for bump stocks. But a ban on them is akin to banning modifications that enable a car to perform differently than when it came from the factory.

131 2018-10-08 22:40:27 Well.., I know the narrative says you should sell some when you double in junior mining stocks, Robert Bishop, in his excellent book:" The Investor's guide to Penny Mining Stocks" (1987) doesn't recommend it. At the end of the day, there is no perfect solution. It's a bit art.

150 2018-10-08 22:30:27 Interest drops in economic hard times. FACT. "Stocks were doing well," as they were propped up by the Government buying its own debt, but many individuals were getting out of this fake money market and into Gold/Silver.

154 2018-10-08 22:28:51 Nope. Wrong. Chinese stocks aren't cheap. That's the myth right? That's why I keep podcasting about them. If they were dirt cheap, throw away cheap- then, sure, I'd take a look. I have less to lose. But at 70x earnings we don't even know are true? Nope.

166 2018-10-08 22:15:13 Investor nerves remain fraught despite a late rally in US stocks. Truculent Italian populists have European investors in sell mode, and reports of terse exchanges between trade negotiators in Beijing sapped US optimism @MicMcCarthy_CMC
167 2018-10-08 22:15:08 my wages went up $10 every two weeks, BUT my health insurance went up so I had to increase my deductible to afford it, my interest went up, my stocks took a dive, I pay more for gas and groceries. The corrupt @GOP sucks at everything!
168 2018-10-08 22:15:00 in 2000 we saw so many stocks down and out starting in 1999 and it went on for over a year. This has been a few months so hard to make that compare like that.

174 2018-10-08 22:11:50 The companies that were frauds were NOT pink sheets. That's what makes it even more egregious. I tell people the risks on the podcast. And that Chinese stocks simply aren't cheap enough for me to buy them with my funny money (roll the dice and see what happens.)

179 2018-10-08 22:08:50 Exactly. Obama took office during an extremely bad recession close to a depression. When he left, interest down, Job rate 4.8, stocks were doing well. Trump is riding on what Obama did. He's going to bring the debt higher, jobs will be lost bc of of his trade wars. He's a loser.

181 2018-10-08 22:07:08 I'm used to thinking of highly illiquid stocks. How do you run a stop loss at 25% down when best bid is 35% down?

182 2018-10-08 22:06:34 U.S. NASDAQ takes a hit as investors focus more on rising bond yields & interest rates, prompting them to back away from more risky tech stocks.
183 2018-10-08 22:06:18 LOL "bump stocks"  you get the same effect if you know how to hold the riffle on your shoulder so it bounces.  Bump stocks are marketing toys for new shooters.
184 2018-10-08 22:05:24 “Ban bump stocks.”  What a joke! Bump stocking is a rapid-fire shooting technique, not a thing. The product sold as a “bump stock” is designed to relieve stress on your arms while you bump stock. 

End Result: Nothing except PR. You’re still allowed to bump stock.

191 2018-10-08 22:01:04 Not many stocks were up today. However, $DVAX was (+4%). Management had a call with JP Morgan investors this morning at 10:00.

Maybe they said something interesting ahead of ESMO? Guess the rest of us will never know.

197 2018-10-08 21:59:11 Agreed, growth stocks by definition are longer duration. Also assumes the free cash flows actually materialize

200 2018-10-08 21:57:21 @MelissaLeeCNBC  Is there a link to the high yielding dividend stocks you recommended tonight? I caught $XOM, $VZ and $PG but not their yields or the other recommendations.  Thanks  !
201 2018-10-08 21:57:12 $IRBT Typical price move that can occur in such a vulnerable environment. Individual stocks can 'all of a sudden' be down 5-10% in one day. Addressed that issue in detail in most recent premium letter for members.
202 2018-10-08 21:57:10 Well, with all due respect, if that is all you know then you should really not look at these companies ... if you read 10ks you have a lot of market data...the disclosure is often no better and no worse than US stocks...

206 2018-10-08 21:55:32 Bump stocks just a accessory to a gun, but sucks makes gun jerky and hard to control. Was banned once before, Obama administration made bump stocks legal again. Know lots of hunters and none use a bump stocks or care to have one. #DefendOurSecond #2A #CHL #NRA #Constitution

212 2018-10-08 21:52:37 I watch the bond market & the rate of interest & the bond sales. US bonds are being dumped by some nations. When stocks up,bonds should be down & vice versa but sometimes normal is not happening.
213 2018-10-08 21:52:01 @LarryBermanETF Whatever happened to daily volatility? And I don't mean the stupid euphemism for stocks going down. Movement in general.  It feels like the last 2 years daily movement of stocks when no big news is being muted by something - algo/HFT/AI trading?  Thoughts?
214 2018-10-08 21:51:52 He said just last week that it was in process. Of course, gun crime will immediately cease with the banning of bump stocks.

224 2018-10-08 21:44:24 Bump stocks? Is that anything like day trading?

228 2018-10-08 21:43:17 How is not banning bump stocks being a coward? There's plenty more effective ways to increase the fire rate of rifles like an AR-15. Hes a conservative, why do you think he would do that?

242 2018-10-08 21:33:17 Gold stocks up on a decent gold and silver price drop. Signs of strength that the bottom is not too far off but I remain cautious here as another wave lower could be underway. $gdxj
243 2018-10-08 21:32:07 We r not in 2007-2009 crisis period..and our stocks behave more because of internal matters..

245 2018-10-08 21:31:29 Ever since they announced they were getting rid of stocks to tier 1 and 3 associates, the stock has been dropping .-.
246 2018-10-08 21:31:01 Nobody had moved out cause they love this economy with Wall Street booming with stocks in in every area is up instead of just the 6high tech companies like in past administration,
247 2018-10-08 21:30:13 Chinese stocks fall almost 5% in market bloodbath as investors digest a week of bad news in a single day: da CHINESE DIDN'T LOSE ANYTHING; IT WAS THE 5% REPUBLICUNT CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS THAT LOST !!
248 2018-10-08 21:30:03 We need a safety plan against you as your campaign took 30 million NRA, blocked access to who donated it. Lied about legislation for bumper stocks, left Paris Climate Accord. Letting industry pollute our water and air! Weakening Welfare and SS with wealth fare!
249 2018-10-08 21:29:11 China stocks are not good to invest in
250 2018-10-08 21:27:50 Glad to follow along..I love investing in technology stocks...
251 2018-10-08 21:26:08 I was promised $BTC would go down if tech stocks went down. Where refund?

256 2018-10-08 21:24:06 Seems a bit fishy to me. It hasn’t bothered the Mormons for years, now it suddenly does? I’m sorry, I have zero trust in anything the Mormon church does. Their closed door meetings, billions of dollars in big pharmaceutical stocks, etc. constantly contradicting themselves.
257 2018-10-08 21:23:03 I don’t think it’s impossible. They’ve done a good job of managing Hazelburn and Glengyle stocks.

259 2018-10-08 21:21:35 Stock exchange gains and losses are no parometer to assess the health of economy. stock traders/investors do not invest in a country but in stocks and they dont give a shit about the economy but there own stock. some greedy bastards made billions out of last economic crises

264 2018-10-08 21:17:42 @MadhavSheth1 how many stocks of realme 2 pro if it was not available to me then I choose another one
265 2018-10-08 21:17:26 at least we’re the best two laughing stocks 
266 2018-10-08 21:15:50 OK took my 1st shot. Your turn. Odds of global liquidity crisis high if yields spike.  This will lead to all taps being cranked wide open. When? Who knows. Glad you're bullish on gold stocks cause my alloc is 40% vs your 10%. :)  (Unlevered & recently bought so I'm OK holding.)
267 2018-10-08 21:15:50 Ok @sainsburys the result is in. Wolverhampton on line shop delivered me a full shop minus 9 out of stocks. 9!! On the back of last week’s PB of 11. 

Ok. What is going on at that store? I would like to know what the current performance verses target for on line availability is
268 2018-10-08 21:15:01 $ACB.CA $ACBFF $APHQF $NXTTF $TCNNF I cant believe I still here peeps in the US say “I don’t follow/trade OTC stocks”.  ....so typical

270 2018-10-08 21:12:50 two stocks that have reported nothing but good news and the market has punished beyond belief
271 2018-10-08 21:10:18 Didn’t you say bump stocks would be banned??
272 2018-10-08 21:08:56 Absolutely-but the implication is that the current stock price could be very wrong too. Buy stocks with approvable drugs where the market doesn’t yet accept that they are approvable
273 2018-10-08 21:08:14 Interesting how all those tech stocks tanked on that news...  Should be pretty easy to document.

277 2018-10-08 21:04:36 That’s just insurance against big downswoon, as those stocks go counter to tech bulls. Own them both as they hedge each other.

279 2018-10-08 21:02:59 You mean that he wasn't a racist twat who was "strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes" and refused to release food stocks for India during the Bengal famine because he hated India that much? Pathethic.
280 2018-10-08 21:02:03 Stop buying downtrending stocks bro. Buy something better at least. You are flushing money down toilet.

282 2018-10-08 21:01:22 And maybe an easier pill to swallow is that you are not smart enough to know which stocks are less over-valued than the market. That one seems more straight forward than what I proposed before.

287 2018-10-08 20:59:12 for what? he has cut spending on background checks, has banned bump stocks as he promised and the new school safety commission isn't investigating school shootings

wtf has he done man?
288 2018-10-08 20:58:58 Yes because every other day someone is using bump stocks to enhance fire power. Oh wait it happened ONCE. Big priority

290 2018-10-08 20:58:22 Reason i hate all these kind of stocks
291 2018-10-08 20:57:57 Nah, more in stocks of course. Leave stocks, sell all options whether green or red and just do DT instead of swing. I always think about it. When they rebound, I forget. When they sink, I always think about it. LoL
292 2018-10-08 20:57:49 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close lower off daily lows amid rate concerns.
293 2018-10-08 20:56:36 Preferring indexing to active management addresses the investor’s ability to drive better returns *relative to* the market. The market being under- or overvalued has nothing to do with the wisdom of picking stocks.
294 2018-10-08 20:56:10 World stocks ex US fell sharply: Europe -1.1%; US -.04%. Italy fears depressed European stocks. US stocks deciding whether 2 days of losses was a trend. Strong market fundamentals should protect market from a correction in the short-term.

301 2018-10-08 20:50:09 You do realize that the middle class own stocks, right? And if you’re in fact working for minimum wage, you’re certainly not the one paying the taxes.

303 2018-10-08 20:49:39 And bump stocks.
304 2018-10-08 20:48:45 New iPhone stocks app update is great for a quick stock check. Shows charts next to each stock so can spot macro trends easy. TSLA seems to have mostly followed the broader selloff.

306 2018-10-08 20:47:53 Trump and the GOP do not care about school shootings. They have not done a single thing to regulate assault rifles or bump stocks or age requirements. The GOP is owned by the NRA!!! 30 million was given to Trump.

Or even better let's run slow hulk ships back to wherever they came from like the old convict ships. Chains, stocks and gruel. Progress! There has to be a deterrent. Going home isn't.
324 2018-10-08 20:39:44 The fact that I didn’t invest in stocks earlier is soooo stupid of me.... lesson learned!
325 2018-10-08 20:39:37 If only Elon's behaviour would get in check...stocks would match this result.

330 2018-10-08 20:32:38 A lot of stocks are dropping today. Might not have been anything specific with Tesla.

342 2018-10-08 20:27:51 it's not as much the data leaks that bother me, because those WILL happen every now and then. it's the cover ups, the attempts to shield assets before stocks drop when people find out about those leaks

and yeah, we need to enforce anti-trust laws to break down those monopolies.

352 2018-10-08 20:21:05 Qd je parle d'entreprises qui produisent,  je ne pensais pas aux supermarchés.

366 2018-10-08 20:12:32 Is it a sunken cost kind of a deal? In one of my other lives I do stocks, and the thing about stocks is that they never know what one has paid for them.

381 2018-10-08 20:08:01 Nope, it would mean investing in what you understand with a portfolio of stocks that make sense as in.

Growth stocks. Dividends stocks. Defensive stocks, etc.
382 2018-10-08 20:07:54 I used today to pick up some value stocks that I like on a longer term like $DIS to test into the 140s next year, $MCD for ATH test, and $GD for 212/219/230. Stocks that aren't as volatile, just in case we have some more downside range.

Another broken promise to Americans, one that will cost lives.

386 2018-10-08 20:06:31 switch to quality stocks and defensive indices like DJI and let the week pass.  Then the selling should be exhausted...

409 2018-10-08 19:55:24 Bloomberg reporters' bonuses used to be partially determined by the effect their stories had on stocks, yes. 

They also would be fired if they attempted to publish false or misleading stories to get a bonus. And advertisers were in no way involved.
410 2018-10-08 19:55:20 Stock exchange is in hand of few bulls, I don't care about this fall in market , it is only to rob us poor investors, hold your stocks, market will rise again soon
411 2018-10-08 19:54:50 And the agreement they had with us was never really a agreement.

427 2018-10-08 19:48:55 Someone told him the NRA supports bump stocks, obviously.
428 2018-10-08 19:48:31 I actually love how there is an unspoken law about how everything in banking and stocks are to be kept a secret

Besides the possibility of going to federal prison of course 

Kind of wish bitcoins had that but it is decentralized so maybe not lol

431 2018-10-08 19:47:36 What happened to banning bump stocks?
432 2018-10-08 19:47:24 I think the stocks opened too low so the second confirmation was already to low and not much to go given the Nq moving average on daily

436 2018-10-08 19:46:19 Unemployment rate is at 4.3% - a 16 year low

Trade deficit has actually dropped (and I was highly skeptical of Trump on trade)

Denying Trump’s good economy is a fools errand.

438 2018-10-08 19:45:05 yep.  That person actually told me that bump stocks "have nothing to do with the 2nd amendment" but couldn't tell me why and nothing she said made any sense with the other things she said. Very very typical of a person who thinks they understand "the constitution".
439 2018-10-08 19:44:34 But if it’s pretty straightforward to project earnings then the market will get that largely right. So no opportunity for significant outperformance. It’s the stocks without approved drugs that the market sometimes gets wrong.

448 2018-10-08 19:41:03 I suppose my point, poorly expressed, was that you need to be clear what investments you are trying to hedge, and what instrument specific to that requirement is going to be the most suitable. Personally it is all just too complicated.  Hold good stocks and cash is simplest.

510 2018-10-08 19:06:48 Was gonna buy stocks this afternoon as tech was down too. Should have pulled the trigger. I believe the market still has another 1-2 years rally left in it. Inflation, rising rates, trade wars scary. But earnings and economy are still so good!
511 2018-10-08 19:05:50 Chinense stocks #FXI are hurting now, but tariffs will only undermine US productivity and economic capabilities while making China even more efficient.  A positive move towards a trade agreement will likely be made soon.
512 2018-10-08 19:04:03 How much PSX lost since ur govt ended 2 months back? From an acclaimed economist like u claiming economic cond of a country is measured on stocks is a joke. Going to IMF isn’t an issue, it’s the conditions on which to get the loan & the amount amounts.

528 2018-10-08 18:56:58 The economy has been growing for the past 8 years. The problem with how fast it's growing now is we're heading for inflation and over valuation of stocks. Remember what happened in 2008 just before Obama took office. We also need to take note of the long range effect of Trump.
529 2018-10-08 18:56:42 They can blame it on yield rates, but the TRUTH is #tech is sinking the #StockMarket for the third straight day. Say you invest in $Tsla. U also invest in Sony, for the radio, or lithium for the battery. So the WHOLE market gets dragged BC tech stocks are too bloated

578 2018-10-08 18:23:12 The stock market is pulling back. Tech stocks are experiencing profit taking. Dragging the markets down. I wonder if this is foreign buyers using a most opputune time to raise scepticism in the US economy. Buy selling shares. A  market correction should  help Democrats.
579 2018-10-08 18:22:06 Our Nation’s court system is THAT stultified. Senator Ryan financially raped this nation on behalf of “liquidity advocates” among families of the very wealthy. So much literal human harm is already done, yet wealthy families of guilt refused to sell stocks.

If you need to get food in the Loop, hit up Stocks and Blondes, Char Dogs from Gold Coast, and Pastrami from Fumare. Reggie's is great for music and bar food.
632 2018-10-08 17:50:33 Some Australian stocks are listed via OTC? For example $ACNNF and $MGCLF? Not the same as ASX but not $299 trade either. Maybe best for volume reasons to be on ASX?

648 2018-10-08 17:41:13 After analysis of last 30 days #stockmarket data and share holding pattern(Sept18) of some quality stocks released till date,I can conclude that in this heavy selloff situation in market,DII & #mutualfund are not participating much in this selloff.They are sitting tight.

649 2018-10-08 17:41:12 How to manage this stock market volatility/fall.
1. Realise that during good times, mis-selling is very rampant and since we make money, we fail to notice it.
2. Investment in stocks/MFs can't act as panacea for your investment needs.
3. Build a well diversified portfolio
650 2018-10-08 17:40:14 This also applies to stocks ;)

671 2018-10-08 17:31:32 GOLD has always been a good buy, make your portfolio stronger by purchasing GOLD with some of your 'Profit'.

GOLD is cheap and well worth an investment, it's not a bubble that can burst like FANG stocks.

Buy GOLD for the long-term.

679 2018-10-08 17:29:02 There are more talented, young assets on the team, and their stocks will go up with more playing time. Guys like Bam, DJJ, and McGruder. There are also picks.

772 2018-10-08 16:57:32 Sir mazaq say hut kar things are going to be very scary as more foreign investers are taking out money from our stocks they should come with atleast one or two goodsl news to pull back investors trust as of noe nothing constructive coming out on economic front
773 2018-10-08 16:57:19 No body knows after six months market will be at below 9000 or above 12000

deploy 5% of your total capital on every 5% correction in market, Exit 5% on every rise of 5% in market

In a normal 6 month period there's NOTHING to do for 4-5 months.

For 15-20 days u notice something is up & u become alert & stalk your stocks.

If some easy "prey" comes your way, u jump on it in the 15-20 remaining days


778 2018-10-08 16:55:56 Charles can you attempt to articulate the total disconnect between rapidly rising oil prices and disinterested Oil Stocks? I think if oil hit 100/brl there would be a mild move up, followed by a sell off if oil dropped to 99.95 the next day! @WSJ
779 2018-10-08 16:55:35 Why do buyers ask for model photos aside from stocks? When you shop online, you get model/stock photos. I’m always so confused by this request. I always include my own photos to accompany stocks but I don’t always personally model them. Help me understand friends! #poshmark

903 2018-10-08 16:12:49 I was looking at their stock performance over the past month and it has taken a very significance dive since the Kaepernick ads came out. That's something big liberal corporations forget, conservatives own stocks, they don't just buy products.

919 2018-10-08 16:07:28 The stocks CEI and GBR dropped down pretty far today so look for those to come back in a few weeks.

929 2018-10-08 16:04:31 Stocks continue to slump, Nasdaq down another 1.5%

948 2018-10-08 15:57:52 reminds me a bit of 2015, stocks got hammered on a perceived "slowdown in China"
949 2018-10-08 15:57:29 While a strong economy is usually a healthy backdrop for stocks, the markets fell as investors sold bonds en mass. That pushed yields to their highest level in over 7 years, indicating that The Street is concerned as to how fast and how high interest rates will ultimately rise.

958 2018-10-08 15:53:52 A market led higher, literally, by 6/7 stocks, with lack of volume and momentum for several years, leveraged like never before, expensive like never before, starts to erase its gains and show us what might be a clear bull trap above Jan highs...

960 2018-10-08 15:53:49 IMO, cannabis stocks are acting very well in the face of broad-based market (risk asset) weakness. Technical picture is looking positive, as explained yesterday. Now if the broad markets could only stabilize here... Don't forget $TRSSF - currently in a blue sky breakout.

962 2018-10-08 15:53:38 Stocks and politics are chaotic systems, therefore intuition doesn’t work.

(In particular, stocks are a second-order chaotic system, where the forecasts influence the system, and thus are unreliable; politics also is, in a measure.)
963 2018-10-08 15:53:37 Well, if at all you had pointed all such things in the last 10 years of status qou powers, currently we would could have avoided it. Since no is faking the economy anymore. No fake investment is being done in stocks to keep them a floating even

966 2018-10-08 15:52:44 Playing this one based purely off of the correlation it's held with other stocks up to this point. 90% correlation between $CGC and $Cron.

972 2018-10-08 15:51:51 The pullback in stocks and bonds were also at least in-part a result of comments by @federalreserve Chairman Powell. In a moderated discussion with @PBS, he expressed confidence in the economy and said rising rates are a "long way" from holding back growth.

983 2018-10-08 15:50:06 #AIM100 today is a great example of how stocks that are overcrowded with late stage bases can fall fast.
984 2018-10-08 15:50:03 One other point, we invest in stocks in our 401k, we take risks, we loose, it us a real lose, we win it is treated as ordinary income, rich invest in stocks, same risks, they win capital gain, they loose, capital lose...why special rules and the % they pay is lower than ours

994 2018-10-08 15:48:11 "interest rates continue to weigh on stocks"
995 2018-10-08 15:48:07 Stocks are so fun
996 2018-10-08 15:47:39 My focus here are stocks with high profiles, lower relative volume and higher volatility.
997 2018-10-08 15:46:39 Terrible day for me again. That's 3 in a row. Only two stocks positive with all being hit hard. 
998 2018-10-08 15:46:25 if stocks close at these levels, they'll fall all the way to their levels of ......six weeks ago.
999 2018-10-08 15:45:58 Since equity bulls tend to be effete, antique-shopping, hairdressing welfare queens, I suspect they are shrieking with rage that stocks have managed to go down a few days and are demanding a government bailout.
1000 2018-10-08 15:45:38 Pour votre info, il est interdit d'utiliser des écailles de tortue de nos jours, mais vu les stocks restant, on continue à fabriquer à la Réunion par exemple, jusqu'à épuisement des dit stocks...

1018 2018-10-08 15:40:02 many rich people do not pay FICA, you only pay it on earned income, not on stock investments, i am not beating up on employer's but truly rich people like Romney make their money on stocks & employ few, my friend brother in law made 500k one year and paid $0 income tax not right
1019 2018-10-08 15:40:00 A business or #stocks are not an intelligent purchase simply because it is unpopular; a contrarian approach is just as foolish as a follow-the-crowd strategy. What’s required is thinking rather than polling. Most people get interested in #Stocks when everyone else is.

1021 2018-10-08 15:39:44 I agree I think it's a bit extreme for the Stock market to complete destruct anytime soon but I do believe in the future a switch will flip and most transactions will be digital.

1022 2018-10-08 15:39:40 I had gained $1000, when i first started trading. I took that money and ran. If i had stayed in it i would have close to $10,000.00 right now. #regrets #robinhood #stocks
1023 2018-10-08 15:39:24 I would say real estate is already foundering. Tax reform made after tax debt costs higher and interest rates have gone higher.

Interest rates are positively correlated with economic growth and recessions are the major resets, so it makes sense rates higher and stocks higher.

Folks “in the Co” early doors are promoting the stock to other Twitter users, that’s how others find out about different stocks so they can then either follow blindly, a bad idea or do a little research & make an educated assessment, simples!
1029 2018-10-08 15:37:01 Facts. But sad truth is just how somebody can learn the flow of the trap you can learn the flow of stocks. But lacking the effort to do so will always keep a person uninformed on how much money out there.
1030 2018-10-08 15:36:54 Dude, y/y GDP growth should not be measured in foreign currency LOL? Also, Alibaba and JD should be considered growth stocks since they are still growing revenue 25-50%, even in USD terms. Also JD is not trading like a growth stock with a 0.4 P/S ratio.

1073 2018-10-08 15:24:18 Ah... yes (though curve flatter). My issue back when the ten year was ~1% was that there was no upside (i.e. duration kicker) should stocks sell off. Better (though not great) at 3.2%. IMO 3.2% is much more compelling vs stocks expected return though than a few years back though.

1152 2018-10-08 14:58:34 If you are a trader start shorting. If you are an investor in quality stocks and have time on your side ( 6 months plus )  sit tight. I am actually buying at the moment as i feel most of the bad news is priced in and if we get a good brexit deal or even a deal  prices will rise.

1169 2018-10-08 14:52:38 Absolutely. Seems to be just a few large stocks, as the number of advancers were really small in the first hour. Pump and Dump again by the looks of it. Used to see it happen for a few days, but now its a few hours at best. Suggests to me we are very close to the top?!
1170 2018-10-08 14:52:12 Michelle, I swear, they are covering something up. Not one person has gotten back to me on Facebook. They are NOT being truthful. I suspect it has to do with their stocks. Tough, they need to be held to account! Lying to coverup, doesn't remedy it.

1183 2018-10-08 14:46:11 Major #crypto mistake even pros make:

Never ever fall in love with your coins or #stocks. They aren’t going to love you back.

As soon as the holding doesn’t fit your process or strategy, cut bait. The market won’t like it more bc you lost $ on it or you fell in love w it.
1184 2018-10-08 14:45:52 Surging yields raise the threat of a tipping point for stocks. Yields on long-term U.S. government debt moved abruptly higher last week, calling into question the durability of the more than nine-year-old bull market for stocks.

That's not a typo. When stocks trade in increments of 1/10th of a penny there's a lack of confidence among institutional investors. Usually it's something shorts said.

1284 2018-10-08 14:11:23 U.S. stocks fell at open on Monday, as a drop in crude prices hurt energy companies and on muted appetite for equities after last week's spike in Treasury yields following healthy economic data.

1286 2018-10-08 14:11:02 S&P 500 bounced off 50-day moving avg (2,878) this morning, holding above that line for now.  200-day line (2,764) is 4% below 50-day line, last tested Feb-May this year. US bond market is closed today (Columbus Day), so stocks getting a break from interest rate volatility today.

1290 2018-10-08 14:09:18 Bounce in US stocks offers a lifeline to risk.
BTFD in US stocks?

From opening well down, stocks have staged a come back. 

The key will be whether US stocks turn positive. If they don't then that could bring the sellers out in force again.
1291 2018-10-08 14:09:12 Again @ChristineRomans refused to state clearly what @amazon workers LOST when they “gained” $15/hr. Higher membership fees; lost bonuses & stocks. How many Amazon workers are actually better of financially? Not to mention the millions of us ripped off by a near doubling of fees.
1292 2018-10-08 14:09:09 As a person who follows stocks constantly....I wonder when the bubble of @wwe will burst.  It continues to raise but it won't last as they are too overexposed, and high paying part timers, and dropping ratings. Too much overseas PPV's doesn't help, I give it less than 6 months.
1293 2018-10-08 14:08:54 His stocks must be going down
1294 2018-10-08 14:08:29 The left talks about "revolution" while the right stocks up on guns and joins militias. Maybe the left should arm up as well--but do it more responsibly and only for direct self-defense.
1295 2018-10-08 14:07:56 The problem is not American debt. We can restructure our entitlements The problem is Europe. Multiply everything you say about the US 3X--from here on out--as it applies to Europe

Europe is part of the equation, always 

Also, it's absurd to suggest US stocks can't/wont fall

1405 2018-10-08 13:29:19 #OSIF18FA it seems as though a bear is upon us. Rising inflation rates, major stock market uncertainty, Dow futures drop 100.... 

Time to buy non-cyclical stocks??
1406 2018-10-08 13:29:17 European stocks traded in the red on Monday, with auto shares among the worst performers amid news European lawmakers could impose higher carbon dioxide emission caps.

1419 2018-10-08 13:23:08 Morning fellas!! 
For 2 week I will work on intraday mode buying the most top gainer stocks on premarket....

Last week I ve made 2 trades with great result... I would improve!
1420 2018-10-08 13:22:51 There will be a flight to safety in the first phase of the Great Asset Reset.  Buy only stocks that you think will continue to take a disproportionate percentage of your wallet share. Avoid any loss making companies!
1421 2018-10-08 13:22:46 For sure - ready to pounce on the opportunity. May actually put some money in. Just amazes me because I see all these ads, etc telling people to get in stocks to get rich. Usually that’s a trigger to bail.
1422 2018-10-08 13:22:43 But the Brazilian markets, apparently, approve as Brazilian stocks are up in premarket trading.

1519 2018-10-08 12:39:41 Fun fact: The vast majority of executive compensation is done through paying them in stocks, which have zero deducted for Social Security. In addition, most of the corp tax cut money has been spent not on worker wages that would help SS, but to buy- back stocks to help execs.

1529 2018-10-08 12:35:37 No.  I don't know anything about stocks or trading.  We use Fidelity for that.  But, my brother does so I thought I'd pass it on.  If he does read it and it's mularchy(sp?)then he'll trash it.  No big deal.  Thanks for your inquiry though.  Have a great day!

1532 2018-10-08 12:32:50 Rules are the same with any instrument - Cut losses fast and let your winners run. But you got to have a different mindset when you deal with options. Stocks don’t lose value with time (time decay) but options do and it makes a big difference.
1533 2018-10-08 12:31:53 Yes. Why wouldn't it be ethical? Do you consider sales taxes and taxes on gasoline unethical? How? The taxing of transactions would generate far more money from the rich than the poor, especially when it comes to the buying and selling of stocks, and that generates a flat UBI.

1573 2018-10-08 12:05:58 No one should be surprised to see a market sell-off because most uptrends in sectors/stocks and market indexes were overly stretched to the upside recently; and now they need some kind of pause/pull-back. But, a rally must make new highs to avoid negative divergences.

1750 2018-10-08 10:06:41 To be honest, the only thing that will save you in bear market is cash. No amount of quality can provide cushion to stocks. Respect valuation but remember even cheap/quality stocks will fall hard in bear market.
1751 2018-10-08 10:06:29 “Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don’t think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same” – Peter Lynch

1812 2018-10-08 09:23:53 Agreed, even big caps are hard enough to track...in fact for avg. investor I think the psychology is much more important than picking stocks...
1813 2018-10-08 09:23:16 agreed - don't understand why the ideas are floated on Friday? for people to think through in weekend and just bang the stocks on Monday. Same old story, retail got hit and will never come back to markets.

1819 2018-10-08 09:17:11 You are such a slow learner. Peripherals are stocked by month to year inventories while urban stocks are fast.

1824 2018-10-08 09:11:26 I would still hesitate to buy almost any stock. When large stocks collapse, relying on fundamentals is good in the long term, but useless in the short term.

2219 2018-10-08 02:56:23 #Nifty Do you hear calls of shopping lists and bottom fishing. Remember Indices have fallen but some stocks fell more than others. Not all stocks will start recovery at same time. Use discretion, buy those that have value, have lower PE, can stand up in current volatile times 1/2

2251 2018-10-08 02:22:50 People don’t understand enough about why the stock market crashed to “predict” a market crash. In the 1920s nearly $0.40 to every dollar borrowed in loans was used to invest in stocks. The stock market doubled in value over 12 months.
2252 2018-10-08 02:22:29 US stocks fell under the weight of rising bond yields on Friday, as solid employment data signaled the Fed was unlikely to change tack on tighter monetary policy.
2253 2018-10-08 02:21:55 With all these stress piling-up, seeing these stocks of sanitary materials keeps me at bay, I feel secured
2254 2018-10-08 02:21:54 $100,000 in stocks = $0 real money 

Glad you understand the liquidity is <1%

Put those facts together => You’re already bankrupt 
2255 2018-10-08 02:21:33 To be fair though, people said the same about Nike and after a dip in their stocks they rebounded significantly. So that's also a possibility.
2256 2018-10-08 02:21:30 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same. ~ Peter Lynch

2259 2018-10-08 02:19:15 Dems may be onto something! They are practicing how to act in a 3rd world country; which is what we'll be if they get power! Stocks will crash, the rich will layoff and sell their assets to avoid higher taxes, and all the free shit promised will turn us into Venezuela! #socialism
2260 2018-10-08 02:17:49 Futures in Hong Kong indicated declines when trading starts, while stocks in Australia and South Korea fell. Japan is shut for a holiday, and Columbus Day in the U.S. means no Treasuries trade on Monday.
2261 2018-10-08 02:17:30 Asian stocks declined at the start of the week and the yuan slipped as investors assessed the latest move by the People’s Bank of China to loosen monetary policy.
2262 2018-10-08 02:16:24 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your bipolar disorder

2296 2018-10-08 01:37:34 The result was 10X credit creation domestically for use in speculative assets - stocks, bonds and real estate. So yet again YES the @federalreserve was responsible for yet another epic bubble which they parlayed into a huge socialist adventure in the 30’s with Roosevelt /3

2308 2018-10-08 01:24:23 Wait ...are you saying some people can buy oil stocks by paying in “whiteness”? Instead of money?

Can I fill up at the pump & pay in whiteness? Which button is that?
2309 2018-10-08 01:24:16 A good piece of advice for new investors from Buffett: "In any upcoming day, week or even year, stocks will be riskier – far riskier – than short-term U.S. bonds. As investment horizon lengthens, a diversified portfolio
of U.S equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds"

2342 2018-10-08 00:59:25 With a dearth of low risk setups on growth stocks, patience is a good virtue to have at this time. The upcoming earnings season may provide direction. $STUDY
2343 2018-10-08 00:56:59 I know several who are not bullish, by virtue of barely owning any. Strong hands does not mean that we have not seen capitulation. Bitcoin can not be directly compared to stocks.  BTW even stocks bottom. Not every one sells out.
2344 2018-10-08 00:54:17 US stocks closed lower as rising Treasury yields take the spotlight off equities. Market is expecting one more Fed rate hike this year and three more in 2019. #USTracker #MorningHuddle
2345 2018-10-08 00:53:40 I support a more compassionate & practical border/immi policy.  I support some minor changes to gun laws (registering, no more bump stocks).  I support insurance for pre-existing conditions availability. Maybe not nearly as sweeping as he might be, but he's willing to work w/ALL.

2347 2018-10-08 00:49:23 I carmelized cauliflower then carrots then garlic, roasted grapes, blended each separately. Cooked ground beef with tea, then tried different combos. (I can’t use stocks or booths from the store due to allergens.) I hope people don’t go hungry...
2348 2018-10-08 00:44:09 Well it finally pulled back far enough for me to be comfortable with getting in. But it's always something with stocks. Now I regret not buying more than I did the first time. So I bought more at a higher price because I don't believe it will go much lower.

2358 2018-10-08 00:36:38 CAUTION to all, Trump supporters and liberals. The @GOP and the @POTUS are going to crash this economy. They plan to scoop up all the cheap stocks from those that panic. Be smart, don't sell. I didn't sell during the last crash and I got all my money back and more. Be Calm.
2359 2018-10-08 00:36:09 Nice pick  tough to see it not run with most weed stocks ripping. I attribute some of that to the lack of pump/hype press releases you see with the garbage weed plays. That’s a good thing long term.
2360 2018-10-08 00:35:07 The top 10 stocks held by index funds usually account for ~20% of the holdings. If Amazon, Microsoft, Apple go down, all indexes gets hit BIG time. 

The funds are diversified but certainly not equally, whereas manually doing it can provide better protection even if u miss upside
2361 2018-10-08 00:32:56 If you normalized that data for inflection points (Fed starts reactively dropping rates AFTER the stocks begin to crash and they start raising rates only after the stocks are solidly in an uptrend), I would wager those graphs would look different
2362 2018-10-08 00:29:34 I hold bitcoin and a number of different stocks. 
I bought bitcoin based on how it is NOW, not based on vague promises of what might happen by virtue of some company or dev team. 
That's, of course, not how I invest in stocks. From them, I expect steady work and steady profits.
2363 2018-10-08 00:26:40 Once again you fail to realize:  The problem is not those that have stocks and shares.  it is the middle class and blue collar workers that are suffering and need help.  It doest not matter to them how high stocks go if they do not have any.  It does not help them at all Pillock.

2371 2018-10-08 00:20:55 Gun control does not mean taking all guns from everyone. Seriously. It doesn’t. 99.9% of gun control proponents, including the 4 largest orgs. pushing for gun legislation reform, want tighter restrictions on getting them, limits on clips, and bump stocks mods banned. Not guns.

2384 2018-10-08 00:05:59 Sad. Unfortunately he's a fraud. There is no sound foundation to his actions other than self aggrandizement. Were you hurt in the Bush financial crash? This market has gone up so fast its dangerous. Wall St makes money when stocks go up OR down. They'll get out in time will you?

2390 2018-10-08 00:00:30 At the start of 2018, we peaked at over 80% of the S&P 500 stocks trading above their 200 day moving average. At new all-time highs in Sept., just over 70% were above that level. We've bottomed twice before at the 50% level this year, so we may be headed to test that level again.
