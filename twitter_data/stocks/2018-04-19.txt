39 2018-04-19 23:46:37 People are treating crypto markets as some unique psychology. Most crypto traders never touched equities. They’re new to finance.

In traditional markets — Valuations run up bigly, scams occur (ever trade OTC penny stocks?)... and regulation makes said markets dumber.
40 2018-04-19 23:46:04 They should stop the bleeding heart seal hunt protesters and then the cod stocks would recover immediately. The food fishery is only a drop in a bucket.
41 2018-04-19 23:44:32 Stocks mean different things. The reason stocks are a must, is that *learning* markets is hard and takes time. When you get good at it, not only are there always opportunities but you can get leveraged exposure to Gold, guns or real estate for that moment when its just right.
42 2018-04-19 23:40:46 My stocks haven't been doing good lately about to sell them and start fresh
43 2018-04-19 23:37:19 So the refs are ignoring high stocks and icings but calling soft ones like that?

Good Lord, this is going to be a long night

54 2018-04-19 23:19:03 I know young fellas that worked in New York trading thousands of stocks a day with low-friction market access and statistical models. I like good old fashioned buying retraces and setting limit orders at far off prices and waiting. The older you get, the more you go back in time.

76 2018-04-19 23:07:23 Wall street firms have turned the markets into a SCAM. No basis for anything has become the standard for most all stocks, and they are making a mockery of responsible investments in the U.S.. Down 5 to 10 percent for no reason is common almost on a daily basis, a complete fraud
77 2018-04-19 23:06:13 Bump stocks have proven beyond any doubt that the AR-15 is too easily configured into an automatic weapon, and therefore the AR-15 must be banned from the public and the bump stock banned as example of an illegal modification to a firearm.
78 2018-04-19 23:03:32 And banning bump stocks is stupid.

93 2018-04-19 22:52:06 Cannabis is certainly safer than alcohol. Obviously accidents can happen with irresponsible weed smokers too, but the overdose factor is gone. But, that's why I've been convinced laws aren't purely about saving lives. Plus, laws don't stop criminals.
94 2018-04-19 22:51:02 I usually rely on Wyckoff.. volume + candles in the same repeating patterns. What Pundi X has though is penny stocks qualities. They split the token 1:1000 to deliberately make people think it's cheap (like ripple) because most people won't figure marketcaps / fundamentals.

117 2018-04-19 22:33:21 A close on Friday above 7197 would mark the 4th consecutive week of gains for FTSE Futures. It would also mark the biggest 4 week rally for at least 91 weeks (since 22 July 2016) #stocks

127 2018-04-19 22:21:37 Not the easiest to get positioned in most stocks today. Been in $NUGT from lower levels for some time now and saw no significant reason to sell and in fact suggested as a buy (again) in chat today on the dip.  Traders guess on gold moves everyday.

263 2018-04-19 20:51:15 We seem to be in circular reference limbo here. Stocks go up which leads to the bond yield going up which leads to stocks going down which leads to the bond yields going down. Right?
264 2018-04-19 20:50:33 So where does this go from here and when?
265 2018-04-19 20:49:27 The top five stocks that fell today were $PM, $ALGN, LRCX, $URI, and $AMAT.

268 2018-04-19 20:48:20 You're not seriously citing 2 stocks in order to claim Israel's economy isn't doing well. Exports are healthy, despite Teva, thanks to electronics exports (Intel). And tourism's booming. Taxes have even been lowered, thanks to the healthy economy. Suck it up.

289 2018-04-19 20:32:40 Schwab Market Update: Stocks decline amid a rise in Treasury yields and mixed earnings reports, with Nasdaq leading major domestic indexes lower. Our latest Market Update:
290 2018-04-19 20:32:14 USD broadly higher as UST 10y-2y yield spread steepens most in over two months.

FF-implied 2019 Fed rate hike path steepens, 2018 flattens as stocks drop but 3-hike consensus holds (one in, two left).

JPY up, AUD & NZD down, echoing stock moves

298 2018-04-19 20:29:21 Market Wrap-Up: stocks closed lower on mixed earnings and rate hike fears. Overbought signals have us a heads up and we were able to double down on QID and CMCSA popped up nicely.

308 2018-04-19 20:17:16 Sometimes, stocks play around at the top for 4 or 5 days, ECYT did that up and down for a few days at the top before correcting. When $I closes below 8, it should be over, otherwise anything can happen for now.
309 2018-04-19 20:16:58 US stocks fall; rest of world flat to higher" US -.6%; Europe flat. No catalyst for gains in US stocks after 3 positive days. Market will respond to earnings surprises but expects 18% eps-growth so some is already priced in. Barring Trump surprises market should head higher.
310 2018-04-19 20:16:32 Hey Ocean - thank you for that. I'm afraid I do not as I don't follow penny stocks (as they are called) as they are extremely dangerous. Remember, you can buy as little of $10 or quality businesses too. I know why you're asking as I did it too - trust me, too dangerous!

509 2018-04-19 18:41:48 There are many different ways to gamble, including:

Casino games
horse racing
Internet gambling
High-risk speculative investing, such as day-trading and penny stocks

610 2018-04-19 17:46:39 I dont have a problem with banning bump stocks. The main producer just said theyre no longer making them. semi automatic rifles make up 1-2% of all gun homicides. So banning them would have no effect on gun crime.
611 2018-04-19 17:46:31 maybe we're range bound for awhile but this bull still has legs with good macro data and what looks like it should be a good earnings season so far.  I wouldn't want to be anywhere near those stocks that have been bid up like $amzn, $tsla, $nflx, etc. this late though.

How did THAT happen?

631 2018-04-19 17:36:35 You made it dude time to retire go invest in stocks or something
632 2018-04-19 17:36:00 AYO CHILL  I had the stocks pre fatherhood 
633 2018-04-19 17:35:17 This whole electric vehicle thing reminds me of the late 90’s when Internet shopping was going to destroy brick & mortar stores. Those stocks all collapsed and here 20 years later brick & mortar is still far and away the #1 choice for shopping and will be forever.
634 2018-04-19 17:35:05 I sold most of my pot stocks to get FUSZ.
635 2018-04-19 17:33:54 @TradeWithNinja I got a dumb question to ask is there a way to spot stocks that fluctuate with market and spot the stocks that doesn’t ? Thanks
636 2018-04-19 17:33:35 As i always said no one puts a gun to your head to buy stocks. If people cant handle it they shouldnt be investing.
637 2018-04-19 17:32:48 TIF and HD...just a little below these levels...both stocks not ready yet trading below resistance
638 2018-04-19 17:32:45 N. Korea is nice? Seriously? Are you aware it's the most socialized/Marxist government on the planet? The US economy is not entirely socialized, if so, why do we speculate on stocks and commodities, and supply/demand for consumer prices?
639 2018-04-19 17:32:37 Hey @adamboultonSKY @faisalislam @BethRigby why haven't you questioned #appeaserTheresaMay about her decision on #Syria that's caused her husbands stocks to rocket in price post Syria attack by Trump, UK and Co.

652 2018-04-19 17:25:40 spoke to a friend who got clocked $22K & said she'll stick it out bcs her broker says stocks come back. I reminded here how long one had to wait from 2008 to get even. Despite the realities of todays economy she'll risk it. Hard to break habit or greed. Maybe at -$30K she gets it

655 2018-04-19 17:24:42 Most of his ideas are already in place. It would do nothing. Bump stocks are being phased out. Suppressors are legal without issue in some states, the length thing I agree with, the background checks are already the same etc

679 2018-04-19 17:13:17 Today was #dividendday in 8th grade. We invested in the stocks last week and have been checking them daily. Today each company paid out dividends for the quarter.
680 2018-04-19 17:12:59 They can't just swap the grips/stocks out and re-market 'em?
681 2018-04-19 17:12:46 I'd really like to see an Essential Phone in person before I made any kind of decision about one but I'm having a hell of a time finding a place that stocks them.
682 2018-04-19 17:12:06 @Fidelity has excellent people working their phones today. Of all the calls I’ve made today I didn’t expect the one about stocks to be the easiest.
683 2018-04-19 17:11:49 2A says nothing about high-capacity magazines or bump stocks or the ages of those in the well-regulated militia. Please spend your time on something useful instead of trying to rile up @POTUS ‘s base.

692 2018-04-19 17:07:54 Yes, if you think stocks as a dividend stream then only the buying price matters not the future changes in valuation.

694 2018-04-19 17:06:35 It was rhetorical. It’s not good for stocks when Fed is removing liquidity.
695 2018-04-19 17:05:45 Yes, but Oil will dump with stocks this Fall imho, like it did post 2007 and 2000, Gold to a lesser extent if at all. They will both soar together afterwards when the Fed and global CBs turn on the monetary spigots again imho: "hard assets".

699 2018-04-19 17:02:50 Whole lotta unhealthiness going on under the surface here in stocks, but still difficult to get too short before OpEx! But I tell you, the wrong headline good reallydo a number on MMs!

701 2018-04-19 17:01:28 Stick to penny stocks, Bradley. I'm sure you'll do just fine.
702 2018-04-19 17:01:05 The worst thing you can do is invest in companies you know nothing about. Unfortunately, buying stocks on ignorance is still a popular American pastime.

714 2018-04-19 16:54:49 Used to trade penny stocks, stuff blows my mind how bad it is there, yet you don't see any regulations trying to crush that markets bullshit... goofy at the least. I'd go as far to say crypto companies are probably scrutinized far more now, than an OTC penny stock by regulations.
715 2018-04-19 16:54:47 That's decent that mate, cheers I will have to get some. Had a bit of a mare (still a newbie of sorts) so want to get myself a new tank and mod. Want a tank that can use stocks and rebuidable too with great flavour. Just learning by asking questions.
716 2018-04-19 16:52:59 The super rich hold most of that in stocks though. That's not just money they can spend. If they sold off a ton of stock to get at that money, it would crash the economy.

1022 2018-04-19 14:51:08 That's what I figured.. If everyone were to lets say... "Buy" on the bid.. who is going to buy your shares higher? Maybe if more people actually bought at the ASK, stocks would move and even help their own position. GL though, it's worth 20-30 times down the road, so bid away.

1048 2018-04-19 14:42:19 Simply set the E(r) for all securities in each asset class equal to the expected volatility of the asset class itself.

1145 2018-04-19 14:10:08 Ex ante assumption, based on first principles, is that risk parity between stocks and bonds, where the stock portfolio is minimum variance weighted, would produce higher returns AND a higher Sharpe ratio than RP between mkt cap stocks + Treasuries.

1150 2018-04-19 14:06:38 However, we might say that stocks and Treasuries should produce similar returns in proportion to their relative risk, (i.e. the CML is positive and a good fit). In which case the ERC portfolio would be ex ante mean-variance efficient.

1152 2018-04-19 14:05:24 Both stocks are halted in Canada
1153 2018-04-19 14:05:23 The minimum variance portfolio is only mean-variance efficient (i.e. maximizes Sharpe ratio) when expected return is unrelated to risk. That's clearly not the case with stocks and Treasuries.

There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)

1167 2018-04-19 13:59:23 David Hogg, Parkland mass shooting survivor and firebrand turned his focus on Black Rock and Vanguard - the richest owners of publicly traded gun stocks. 
He was crucified: "Sorry, Davey," wrote one hater, "but on Wall Street, no one can hear you scream." 
 May he not grow weary.
1168 2018-04-19 13:58:59 All I can say is you in particular should just not invest in stocks - or even talk about the market.
1169 2018-04-19 13:58:23 Looks sector oriented, peers down a bundle.  Plus, I lost half my hair trying to make sense of anything..save yourself from trying! Stocks have a mind of their own
1170 2018-04-19 13:58:06 Rarely do I chime in on biotech stocks or ever bother to take a position. $GWPH on the other hand has me intrigued. I'm all for decriminalization and punishment of marijuana, but I'm not a proponent of it's legal use. The reason? The THC is more harmful than helpful. (1/X)

1280 2018-04-19 13:14:54 I would add: It’s a market of stocks and not just a stock market.
1281 2018-04-19 13:13:26 Bank stocks had one of the biggest moves over past 18 months while the curve was pancaked.  As curve bottoms it often does so with V spike, bank stocks have already sniffed it before it happened and steepener is initially risk off.  Later, see if system can absorb otherwise pain.
1282 2018-04-19 13:12:52 $AMD Just never stops. Continual hype, all the way down. Hard to be open to better stocks when one is obsessed with ONE losing stock. $STUDY

1289 2018-04-19 13:11:05 Wall street scamming investors and IRAs again today and for last 4 quarters, complete scam.

1291 2018-04-19 13:08:35 When the bottom was in and prices started to go back up in 2016 on both the oil spot and stocks that was the best time to be a buyer. If you look at Rdsb it was still going down in 2015.

1474 2018-04-19 11:23:34 I agree with you on the second sentence :-) However, in illiquid stocks, since few corner it, many times, "Alpha" is not genuine. This makes it a dangerous proposition. Also, announcements come strategically to reflect in price. All the best my dear.

1510 2018-04-19 10:53:42 Hope you were discussing the most undervalued stock on the ASX, due to its potential in SMN? 
Without going into all the reasons, lets look at the 1000 stocks that currently have a market cap over 500 million, yet the business, like so many will never return a divi to investors.

1535 2018-04-19 10:30:24 Sugar stocks are cyclic in nature. If you can hold for 3+ yrs then if possible, average a little on these dips and hold. If your view is short term or 1 year, better exit coz in shorter run it will fall a little more.

Clearly, we're talking time travel if I'm going back to ten with all of the knowledge I have now, in which case, I'm bringing info about which stocks to buy (Microsoft, Nike, etc.) and some winning lottery numbers. So, I'll be richer younger for longer!
1543 2018-04-19 10:23:29 one day will come, when they will open empty stores due to no stocks....
1544 2018-04-19 10:22:33 Agree. But then you have some stocks reaching new highs while simultaneously flaunting off their overvaluations. 
1545 2018-04-19 10:22:30 Consolidation is the term for a stock or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. Consolidated stocks typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few trading opportunities until another pattern emerges.
1546 2018-04-19 10:20:48 What nonsense. Full transparency is required of the evidence that forms the basis of the accusation: the material evidence from the Skripals. That is no more than courts demand. Deflecting attention onto Russia's alleged CW stocks is irrelevant and really is muddying the issue.

1553 2018-04-19 10:16:20 The best investing plan focuses on 
1) taxes
2) expenses 
3) protection of principal 
And then looks for a high return. That's why buying ETFs for dividend stocks ( defensive) and tech stocks ( aggressive ) every month forever is my suggestion

1559 2018-04-19 10:12:23 ETF: exchange traded fund. A financial product that trades like a normal share but actually has an underlying exposure to a multitude of different assets. Often these assets are grouped by a financial or economic theme. For example: Financial stocks. They are low cost and liquid.

I try to look at what I did each day and think - "where could I be better?" "what did I miss?" "Am i trading stocks in play?"

1969 2018-04-19 04:29:54 See your point, but Vangaurd is a fund manufacturer, not a utility, and just like any other asset manager it can pursue a mandate and market it to investors. This includes a modified indexing strategy that excludes certain stocks but still tracks its underlying index
1970 2018-04-19 04:28:56 I wouldn't say irrelevant. We should diversify our trade like we do our stocks. Just prudent. We make corporations compete, why shouldn't countries compete for trade without kickbacks that is.

1975 2018-04-19 04:25:44 Get your facts straight. And realize that you're misinformed on the topic. Do some research on gun statistics from the CDC. Also realize that they make bump stocks for pistols and they can hold a 100 round drum magazine. Any gun can be modified. Not just ar15s

1979 2018-04-19 04:23:17 >Falsehood: the AR15 can shoot more rounds than a Glock9.
it depends on the proficiency of the shooter, but both can fire at a very similar rate.
Falsehood: bump stocks allow the weapon to become fully automatic; They don't they just add stability, again, depends on the shooter.
1980 2018-04-19 04:22:16 I'm not. If you look at my post, I'm pointing out that the combination of semi-auto PLUS the ability to fit bump stocks PLUS high-capacity magazines is what makes AR-15s so beloved by mass shooters. Also, semi-auto rifles make no sense in a civilian context.

1985 2018-04-19 04:17:39 trying to pick stocks in SME exchange is madness ! I am terrified even of smallcaps on NSE/BSE.

1986 2018-04-19 04:16:27 $HMNY this is one of the few stocks where I approach it like an entrepreneur and not a chart reader (and TA is my game).
1987 2018-04-19 04:16:19 How about your Alma Matter (Yale) and their $25 Billion endowment?  Or Your employer (Berkeley) which uses their $4+ Billion endowment invested in corporate stocks to pay your salary?

Bump stocks are made so they'll work. Belt loops may fail.

2000 2018-04-19 04:09:37 Rain Ind has no relation with this IPO. It is just rub off effect, people club it together under "carbon" stocks along with Graphite India and HEG.

2009 2018-04-19 04:03:37 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U.

2107 2018-04-19 03:01:27 The recent flattening has been notable, but it is not unusual. The yield curve has always tended to flatten once the Fed started to hike. In addition, the crucial point here is that stocks didn't tend to peak until after the yield curve got outright inverted.

2162 2018-04-19 02:29:40 I just went through 2000 charts of stocks today. There are so many more good ones than bad ones that it's not even funny. It isn't even close. I don't know what sort of institutional selling you're talking about, I see the opposite
2163 2018-04-19 02:29:01 of course since everybody IS falling for this IN THE NEAR TERM the companies that release BEVs will see their stocks go up ...

but in the long term the Hybrid and PHEV companies will beat them out ...

due to profitability or lack thereof ...

2202 2018-04-19 01:46:43 Short term yes, you can have quarters like 2018Q1 where both stocks and bonds go down. Long term, nominal economic growth is either above the cost of debt (good for stocks, bad for bonds) or below (good for bonds, bad for stocks)

2214 2018-04-19 01:38:02 Koufax was excellent from 1962-66, but he also pitched under incredibly favorable conditions. Scoring levels in his time were at post Deadball Era low, and in Dodger Stadium even moreso. Park- & era-adjusted stats bump him down considerably.

2222 2018-04-19 01:32:21 My tweet wasn’t an indictment on Koufax in the HOF or his place in the game. It was referencing that like Koufax, Puckett was taken from the game too soon.  They are both HOF IMO and it’s fine if we don’t agree, just was asking why.

2236 2018-04-19 01:22:38 Looks to me that the etoh stocks drawdown since the beginning of March may be the largest ever in 1.5 months? @chrishighs @E_Energy_Adams
2237 2018-04-19 01:21:57 oh jawad - i don't know, man. 5-yr real rates rose from -45bps to +75pbs and stocks ripped. the dollar saved it from certain doom. if stocks fall and/or real rates revert, THEN gold gets interesting
2238 2018-04-19 01:21:30 I can see you are not an investor. Those stocks will certainly tank. Where you think the money in the market comes from Alabama? Tennessee?

2243 2018-04-19 01:17:45 Is this bull market going to continue? 

Or is it nearing the final end?

It feels as if the market is just gonna go back to ATHs. But then again, it doesn’t.

2246 2018-04-19 01:16:08 the runs now are dull and muted in comparison, stocks were doubling every 24 hours in my memory. If you had your money in a few days you could relax a bit but watching your portfolio crash 100% in a few minutes is crazy too.
2247 2018-04-19 01:15:55 $CLM 2018 Distribution will be $2.838.  Current yield - 18.26%.  Barring any financial turn for stocks, this should grow until Oct. 25th(ish).  Probably hit $17.50.  Then big dip down to current peak of $15.50.
2248 2018-04-19 01:15:29 1.) Fly to Peru  meet my brother I’ve never met before and hike to machu pichu with a llama
2.) Invest in stocks, tech, and some type of insurance 
3.) My mom and grandma for motivating me to do my best
2249 2018-04-19 01:14:33 Boycotting an investment firm and boycotting all of a firms’ investments are 2 different things. Twitter can‘t control BlackRock buys its stock. BlackRock can control what stocks it buys. Not the same. But you know that.
2250 2018-04-19 01:14:31 you said tirades but i read “trades” as in, sudden selling off of stocks. wondering if anyone will make hasty bank moves..
2251 2018-04-19 01:11:51 Waste of money to get work done then u get pregnant. Should’ve just invested in stocks.
2252 2018-04-19 01:11:51 Yeah I looked up a bunch of info on 2014 USA. Lots of sky rocketing stocks on the PINK sheets. Then big crash, which did make me worry same thing would happen with cdn stocks when i first got in.
2253 2018-04-19 01:09:46 5. Executive order that banned bump stocks 
6. Before ... only felons were banned from gun purchase ... now, all it takes is domestic assault 
Then you add in the work on the opioid crisis and illegal immigration and you have solid plans to crack down on gun violence
2254 2018-04-19 01:08:07 Jake, you know better than to actually me with an apples (individual stocks) and oranges (sectors) comparison.
2255 2018-04-19 01:05:26 Thanks for bringing it up!  I am an investor & will voice my concerns.  I'm sure funds can make small adjustments to eliminate these stocks, in favor of others.
2256 2018-04-19 01:02:03 Comment babe I'm sure it will be ignored by the stocks I can ministration at least my voice has been documented
2257 2018-04-19 01:02:00 Agree to disagree. Personally i refinanced my house at 2.59% pulled 150k equity out. The refinance will cost 400 more a month in payments. My investments from that bring in probably around 900 a month through stocks, solar and private investment. Seems good to me!

2260 2018-04-19 01:00:41 Put GNCC on your radar-it’s a RM happening with a very large MJ grower. Check out the DD on it via IHub. Filings should be sooner than later. Bright Green Group is the company merging in.
2261 2018-04-19 01:00:18 Shawver: Ban bump stocks as "no citizen needs an automatic weapon" and close gun show loop hole.
2262 2018-04-19 00:59:59 Why wouldn't there be a closure of the activity that creates the most impact. That would be commercial.  The food fishery doesn't impact the stocks with Any detriment. Its ass backwards
2263 2018-04-19 00:58:56 Trading stocks having good fundamentals makes it so much easier. Any technical setup you're looking at has much higher reward-risk ratio and is more likely to go as planned (i.e. up).

2272 2018-04-19 00:54:11 So 1 million people including me, my uncles, and cousins are now felons? I could care less about bump stocks, I care cuz this sets a precedent where "alphabetical agencies can rewrite laws as they see fit". @realDonaldTrump @NRA on some shit, get your heads out of your buttholes
2273 2018-04-19 00:51:12 After hitting an all-time low of -20.31% in early February, I made some trades and have seen strong growth of +19.83% in the last month to finally be back in the green! #Stocks #Investments #RobinHoodApp

2278 2018-04-19 00:48:20 I personally don't think he is any good at picking stocks. Has a poor portfolio, and even worse timing. His metrics for assessing a company are poor. Many current bottom dwellers were his past top picks. 

VET is going up and SPE holders are getting the benefit of the gains.

2301 2018-04-19 00:31:17 Fr, even ETFs that have exposure to gun stocks are gonna do well. Negative is you’re indirectly supporting the gun industry

Trump deliberately & deceptively sound off on trade wars he has no intention of waging to drive down stock prices so him & his oligarchs & too big to fail banks can use the $1.8 tri from tax (theft) to buy back stocks at a lower rate

I was trying to have no favourites, but tracking a large list doesn't seem actionable daily, as one misses the correct buy points.
2316 2018-04-19 00:18:58 Gun stocks not guns

2320 2018-04-19 00:15:52 People make money on penny stocks too, except when they don't.  If your justification for how awesome Bitcoin is is "number go up forever!" then you don't have one.
2321 2018-04-19 00:15:51 In Sweden, you can buy a hand grenade for about $30, and there are grenade attacks almost daily, according to @KTHopkins .
No word on whether these grenades have pistol grips, bayonet mounts or bump stocks.
2322 2018-04-19 00:15:37 No way your stocks are up 21% under Trumps Budget. Maybe since he took office but now that Trumps Economic plan has taken effect the market is down. We just had our first negative quarter in like 3 years

2324 2018-04-19 00:14:32 CDN interest sensitive stocks remain waaaay oversold IMHO. Particularly if Bank of Canada is done until the summer.
2325 2018-04-19 00:14:28 I don't know where he gets those numbers from. MSCI USA Utilites IMI fell 46.17% peak to trough, while MSCI USA IMI fell 55.26% peak to trough in 2007-2009. I still agree with the main point that there is no such thing as low risk stocks, though.
2326 2018-04-19 00:12:37 Canopy is not there for a reason right? People ignore all the reasons when buying these which is fine because the stocks go up and down just fine without profits but the table is slanted against weedcos south of the border.

2335 2018-04-19 00:09:23 Laughably @davidhogg111 doesn't realize the vitriol, rhetoric and way he prescribes in dealing with violence in the US drives the desirability of gun makers stocks. People will want something others tell them they cannot have from drugs to Twinkies to Zima to guns.
2336 2018-04-19 00:09:10 Who was that billionaire that bought $GE at $20 claiming it was at a bottom?  You should always do your own research on stocks.  Don't just follow what others do, even if they are right most of the time.
