30 2018-10-31 23:45:03 The private sector can save in equities, stocks, housing, bank accounts etc. Some or many people saved money since 6000 years ago when money and literacy and accounting was invented. There was no government deficit or anything equivalent back then.

32 2018-10-31 23:44:41 Trump I highly doubt that your supporters have stocks. Making petty threats is getting so old just like you. The market was up before you took office & you gloat the success but now it's falling so I’ll give you credit for that too.

34 2018-10-31 23:44:32 going to Australia in 12 days for work. that means no more countertrend and low reward ranging stock trading. going for swing and trend following style and totally disregarding stocks below 100MA
35 2018-10-31 23:44:27 Hard to get long below the 200ma. Are there any weed stocks in the XBI btw?
36 2018-10-31 23:43:38 stocks rise by 1%.

38 2018-10-31 23:42:05 Been investing for about 10 years. 
Investing in high yielding defensive stocks at a fair price and reinvesting the dividends has worked well.  Also you don't get too many scares.
39 2018-10-31 23:42:03 Crude Oil Price Falls on Record US Output, Trade Data May Hurt AUD: The British Pound rose on Brexit deal hopes while oil prices fell on record US crude output data as stocks and FX diverged. Australian Dollar may fall on a weaker trade surplus.
40 2018-10-31 23:40:45 No, sorry. Not a gold bug right now and not really following any bugs to name. Just moved more cash into #uranium stocks at open today as that is where I see long term #ViolentUpside from here. Cheers!
41 2018-10-31 23:37:28 But those companies still own themselves. Whether it's employee owned(through unions) or through stocks. It's still privately owned.

47 2018-10-31 23:31:27 #Nike earnings (what actually matters) outperformed expectations & grew more than industry average. Nike stock only saw moderate underperformance in Oct due to going up so much after Kaep ad. Still outperformed most popular brand stocks. Nike $$ don’t care about anti-black racism
48 2018-10-31 23:31:20 Alright I’m investing my money into stocks
49 2018-10-31 23:31:03 The picture is misleading as it does not show the growth that started in 2009. And more importantly wealth is built by narrowing the wage gap. The sm is not an indication of wealth as just over 50% of people even own stocks. Economists believe we are headed for a crash btw.
50 2018-10-31 23:28:57 U.S. stocks rebounded for a second day overnight as investors snapped up beaten-down technology and internet shares. The Dow Jones rose 241.12 points to 25,115.76, the S&P 500  gained 29.11 points to 2,711.74 and the Nasdaq added 144.25 points to 7,305.90.
51 2018-10-31 23:28:47 Aren’t stocks as opposed to change in stocks also less than the 5 year avg?
52 2018-10-31 23:27:56 I have trouble sitting through 2 weeks of Red, resulting in 14% being lopped of stocks that are up 11,000% the past 5 years.... not sure I would’ve made it through the 30’s!
53 2018-10-31 23:27:39 Yes. My stocks are up. My 401k is up. My salary is up. I feel more secure with border control and historic NOKO talks. My
54 2018-10-31 23:27:02 Well one of better speeches but democrats never said that at all and that again promotes non unity and stocks for yearly rate is still on low for year it’s like day one for year and only people that made money is the rich
55 2018-10-31 23:26:49 I only own shitty stocks
56 2018-10-31 23:25:36 I’m alway baffled by the stock market in China. How does an economy growing at about 6.5% have an over 20% sell off in stocks? Shanghai index looks flat for years yet economy is supposedly doing great. All very strange.
57 2018-10-31 23:24:16 Our honest and truthful president has made Trump rich again, he has the stocks the highest it has ever been, gas price is the lowest,  the people are all working as one we are not divided. Everyone is getting very rich they could all retire.  All the news are fake so is Trump
58 2018-10-31 23:22:58 Bottom for stocks? So melt-up when Rs gain seats?
59 2018-10-31 23:22:21 And Take Note The Stock Market Is Waiting For Results !

If You Don’t Vote Dems Out You Will See A Major Decline In Stocks And 401K’s If Democrats Take Back The House !

If You Do Not Vote That Is A Vote For A Democrat !

60 2018-10-31 23:21:07 Yeah, but many stocks relatively held up or strong during October got beaten up today. Wall Street crooks.

62 2018-10-31 23:18:44 GE flirting with $10. Not good. Many pension plans, etc., have a $10 rule, they can't own $9 stocks!
63 2018-10-31 23:18:06 I’ve been to all three grocery stores in this whole godforsaken town and all anyone stocks here is pizza and beer.

66 2018-10-31 23:15:20 You can't keep printing and selling stocks if you don't have the cold-hard cash to pay out every single shareholder their investment. This whole idea Trump is pushing is going to crash. But the price of gas, milk, eggs, and bread will go down.
67 2018-10-31 23:14:22 Don't underestimate buying selective Chinese stocks..
Eventual end tariff war expect will be arriving..
Besides, monetary and physical policy shall stimumate Chinese economy..
68 2018-10-31 23:13:53 WHAT ?! You’re comparing that to the 2018 society  this is why americans are laughing stocks on this planet. But lets just say that were to happen how is your rifle going to protect you with modern warfare technology. Drones...figther jets... tanks. So many empty brains

73 2018-10-31 23:05:44 another way of saying that "gold outperformed equities" (obviously not in the past 7 years!) is "bear market". Stocks are going down, when priced objectively.

No other country in the world allow their own homegrown industries to be overrun by foreign automakers! MAGA???

103 2018-10-31 22:36:06 US stocks have rebounded for a second day as investors snapped up beaten-down technology and internet favourites and strong company results lifted spirits even as the S&P 500 closed out its worst month in seven years

109 2018-10-31 22:32:33 I guess the reason for starting this is that people new to investment might think these rags are good.  I was looking at two sell ideas from the IC.

Also, the #USD outperforms most G10 #currencies.

Good luck and good trading !
117 2018-10-31 22:29:30 Buy within your means. Whether stocks or housing, over stretching or speculating on short term gains is extremely risky. People shouldn’t be buying homes they can’t afford. The stress test has definitely helped that from happening in the future.
118 2018-10-31 22:27:05 If $AAPL pops we see round 2 of today with FANG stocks up 2-4% if $AAPL tanks we see last weeks sell of all over again after $AMZN $GOOG earnings. Being an independent trader on a dependent stock

132 2018-10-31 22:19:08 Patience is wonderful. The company that laid me off in the 2009 shenanigans, that put me in financial ruin, just had their IPO.  9 yrs, I've been holding onto my vested valueless, private stocks and now, I might actually rise from poverty a little. It's a good skill to practice.
133 2018-10-31 22:17:27 Fire automatic. For the most part machine guns aren't sold to civs. A bump stock doesn't make a gun fire as fast as an automatic. And assault is a verb. An assault weapon is anything you use to attack someone. Banning bump stocks is dumb as well but for different reasons.
134 2018-10-31 22:16:54 The day before that tweet $TSLA was abt $345 looking to consolidate in the 320s right after a substantial Q2 call surge. Now factor in the 10% market corr (20% for all growth stocks like $TSLA) we are looking at 260. Add Q3 beat 20%.
So basically not too far from where its today.
135 2018-10-31 22:16:07 Yes this $GOAT etf sounds super timely. I’m sure the FAANG stocks don’t know anything about durable, global moats.

136 2018-10-31 22:15:55 Open talk of a West Coast dealer licenced company trying to terminate their sale.  #CBD #PotStocks .  Never accept penny stocks instead of cash I guess is the lesson.
137 2018-10-31 22:15:27 But vs this, stocks perform better when a split House/Senate as stocks like nothing more than a bit of can kicking :)
138 2018-10-31 22:15:27 Stocks end October with gains today. However, the S&amp;P is down 7% for October.
139 2018-10-31 22:15:05 Past midday, MBS lower. Stocks holding gains. 10-yr yld 3.14%.

141 2018-10-31 22:13:28 October's Carnage at-a-glance...
Nasdaq 100 worst month since Oct 2008

S&P worst month since Feb 2009 (lowest monthly close since April)

Semis plunged almost 15%, the biggest monthly drop since Nov 2008

"Most Shorted" stocks down 13.8% in October - worst month
142 2018-10-31 22:13:22 When people like you start reasoning like this, nincompoop becomes more literate. Point of correction, it’s peace . Just be mindful your head need knowledge stocks up.
143 2018-10-31 22:12:51 Since it's a ratio, yields don't have to fall for this ratio to head down. All that's needed really is for stocks to fall really fast. Yields could even rise (i.e. bond prices decline) and the ratio still falls, provided stock prices decline faster than bond prices.
144 2018-10-31 22:11:46 Still better than any other stocks in entire US index

148 2018-10-31 22:07:50 Il y a échange d'espèces + marchandises => y'a des stocks et des factures d'achat. Tout ceci peut être pisté. Mais sinon une des idées serait la même qu'avec la bombe nucléaire => si le risque encouru est trop grand (prendre 5 ans de ferme) plus personne ne bouge le petit doigt.

150 2018-10-31 22:06:51 You realize the milling machines required to make an ar automatic and the time and knowledge to learn how to do so costs like over 10 grand. And bump stocks make a weapon completely inaccurate. A bottom of the line ar costs 600 to 800 dollars depending on how scared people are1/2
151 2018-10-31 22:06:11 Stocks are a different animal thats all I know to many people to deal with.

156 2018-10-31 22:01:38 There's nothing wrong with having long rifles that are used for hunting, even if they have mil background.  There's no civilian need for semi-auto, especially when conversion kits and bump stocks create effective automatic weapons.

161 2018-10-31 21:58:27 I felt bad making that statement! I know we have to use the simplest terms with the left! Gun, “ Tube” and bullets are about as far as the get!

165 2018-10-31 21:57:23 Total loss of $25 in stocks in October. Hopefully November will bring more fortune. They look like they’re going up again.
166 2018-10-31 21:56:39 I’m sorry but stocks don’t reflect that optimistic statement.
167 2018-10-31 21:56:20 US stocks rebounded as investors snapped up beaten-down tech & internet favourites & strong company results lifted spirits even as the S&P500 closed out its worst month in 7 years. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 26 points higher at 5,824. #ausshares #stockmarket

171 2018-10-31 21:52:45 Exactly the type of stocks that are almost completely abandoned and soon sold blood dry.
172 2018-10-31 21:52:29 If I'm not mistaken, for the GTAA/Ivy Portfolio, October has triggered a sell signal in US Stocks (VTI), Real Estate (VNQ), and Commodities (DBC), which would leave it 100% cash, as exits already triggered in Foreign Stocks (VEU) in May, and US Bonds (IEF) this time last year.
173 2018-10-31 21:51:56 reasonable is open to interpretation and, many people acknowledge that they want to b more restrictive than banning semi automatic weapons and bump stocks...Thanks for the voting tip though...I already cast my ballot
174 2018-10-31 21:51:48 Tech stocks plunged in October, suffering their worst month since the 2008 recession.
175 2018-10-31 21:51:45 Not in this case! You guys were on fire. Having their stupid and amateurish plot to frame Bob Mueller (Bob Mueller!) exposed has to be completely humiliating. They're laughing stocks now.
176 2018-10-31 21:51:26 Fun fact. If I didn’t have Amazon, Nike, Tesla and other stocks Trump has trashed, I’d be sunk. All we have to do is look at the portfolio and know he is wrong. He outright lying and counting on US to be REALLY stupid.

186 2018-10-31 21:45:03 RT @SmithBusinessCo: RT @jimcramer: RT @ScottWapnerCNBC: As my friend @jimcramer has been saying repeatedly, stocks have been falling mostly because of The Tariffs and fears of The Fed. The market had "priced in" the idea of the Democrats winning the House for months.
187 2018-10-31 21:43:26 The market has lost everything it made in the last year! Most of your fans don't own stocks! But prices on goods are going up and are forcasted to continue on the up swing! Vote blue! Dems are the party of the people!
188 2018-10-31 21:43:14 Seems there are limited stocks of the over 65 vaccine and the basic flu vaccine has not been authorised for administration to the over 65s, even if done privately. So, many over 65s are currently being refused any flu jabs.
189 2018-10-31 21:42:26 You sure weren’t taking credit when stocks were falling all month. Still down for October overall.

205 2018-10-31 21:36:19 What are Universal Background checks as opposed to background checks? Responsible gun owners use bump stocks responsibly, and don't really agree there. Word on the street is you also support banning certain rifles. Would love to hear more about that...

It's 87% of tax 'savings' in the income tax going to only 1% of citizens.

230 2018-10-31 21:26:39 More and more stocks starting to move on their own merit and disconnecting from major averages, too. Often the worst is behind when that happens. Can still retest lows or even crack them, but likely to be more pockets of strength rather than everything flushing like we've seen.

232 2018-10-31 21:25:00 Also, protecting the climate is pro-life. And diplomacy with war only as a last resort is pro-life. And reasonable firearm limitations (bump stocks, for instance) is pro-life. And affordable health insurance for all is pro-life. Etc.

245 2018-10-31 21:19:07 I don't provide entries on twitter, only in chat. I use momentum scanners to find stocks going up and buy them. This is a common strategy. I didn't trade $SBBP or $CARV.  The patterns you are seeing of pops and drops is common with small caps. Momentum traders trade volatility.
246 2018-10-31 21:18:11 Agreed! Since last week it have been super slow. I guess confidence is down cause of the bear market so it is not so easy find sheeps to pump up stocks.

248 2018-10-31 21:15:24 If stocks are low and rationing starts...
249 2018-10-31 21:15:05 Agreed, spot on.  There is some reasoning to support the business side of things because profits mean better dividends, but less than half of the folks in the US have stocks.

312 2018-10-31 20:30:13 The brutal lows in August? Despondent... but the last run up was surgical - the stocks (and sector) often move independently.

318 2018-10-31 20:29:01 This oil price drop, IMO, is massively overdone. Between surging DXY, huge COT long sell-off, brutal broader equity markets, micro-management of global crude stocks prior to IR sanctions, and on-going (and recently stoked) trade worries between CN/US, and this is ripe to rip.

368 2018-10-31 20:08:10 انا نفس الشي
اعتقد ان وقف الخسارة في الشركات الممتازة
ماله داعي . بشرط ان تكون الشركة قوية وحتمال الارتداد وفي حالة وقف الخسارة يجب ان يكون بسيط وسريع او بالطريقة هذي انت خسران خسارة كبيره
يجب تحديد وقف الخسارة عند نقطة اقل من الشراء بسيطة وطبعا تكون متتبع للتحليل الفني
369 2018-10-31 20:07:48 STOCKS ARE DECLINING because of 1) massive USA budget deficits caused by republicans tax cuts for billionaires & 2) corporate executives & professional investor selling. They are seeing foreign countries cutting back on purchases from USA businesses.  they hate trump and GOP.

372 2018-10-31 20:06:02 Futures I believe (NFA is non-gov regulator under the CFTC) not securities which are regulated by the SEC. The Wolf of Wall Street was a thug who defrauded average ppl slinging penny stocks. So it seems Jacob is a little mixed up on the industry he proclaimed to be a genius in
373 2018-10-31 20:05:54 U.S. stocks were on track earlier today for their biggest Halloween gain since 2000 (and second-biggest since at least 1950), but then shares mysteriously dropped more than 1% into the close.

Now that’s spooky.

375 2018-10-31 20:05:08 Stocks continue recovery. The Dow returned to positive year-to-date, closing at 25,115.76, up 241.12 (+0.97%). Nasdaq +2.01%. S&P +1.09%.
376 2018-10-31 20:04:50 It’s that time of the year when US stocks close at 21:00 and @TheStalwart wakes up before I’m at my job

381 2018-10-31 20:01:06 Breaking (4:00 PM EDT): Stocks surge to cap off wild October, but S&P 500 posts biggest monthly loss since 2011 -- CNBC
382 2018-10-31 20:01:05 That's a great question and thanks for butting in. 

Stocks are best thought of as long-term accumulator assets. If you're relying no them for the distribution phase you're creating unnecessary funding risk.
383 2018-10-31 20:00:58 Dear Liar Donald, you have borrowed 1.5T dollars. You need to sell that debt. For anyone to want buy that debt vs stocks, interest rates have to rise. Because you borrowed 1.5T dollars. So best keep quiet about the DOW until you've actually attended economics 101.
384 2018-10-31 20:00:55 Cheap foreign stuff is usually cheap for a reason, like you implied with Russia. Lots of political risk and low protection of property rights. How does such risk affect the “buy low cape foreign stocks” idea?

386 2018-10-31 19:59:37 Begs lots of questions. Among them, I think shifts in political risk are opportunities. When a country goes hard socialist like VZ did, short it. If one heads more free market, buy it up. Does your “buy cheap foreign stocks” take that stuff into account?

391 2018-10-31 19:57:47 Great question for your Financial Advisor (one I can't answer) is what Stock (or small group of stocks)  could I buy today hold for 15 years and rely upon Dividends Paid only.  You will never sell it so payout is the only thing that matters. Least Risk Highest Payout! #GetAdvice

403 2018-10-31 19:50:53 in other words, market cap negative alpha is counterbalanced by the fact that access to them is cheapest. that spread is dynamic but i'm imagining a case where 500 stocks are free to access and the rest are not being the interesting case

407 2018-10-31 19:49:57 biggest fraud - in my opinion is Warren Buffett -  he has largest % cash position of all time, yet, he only talks about buying stocks for the long term. Has he once said" if you want to invest like I do, have 75% in cash NOW, because that is what I have" - then only 25% at risk
408 2018-10-31 19:49:22 Oh dear, lol. I understand stocks and investing, as you clearly have a bit to learn. Been investing before you went to Kindergarten. ;)

430 2018-10-31 19:42:20 My stocks have been going up for nearly 9 years.  You’ve only been around for about 2.  You do the math.
431 2018-10-31 19:42:00 A better strategy might be to buy stocks 1-1.5y after you guys release a short report on it
432 2018-10-31 19:40:44 How about the cannabis stocks??
433 2018-10-31 19:40:43 weed stocks were total baes today
434 2018-10-31 19:40:38 Really, stocks at the same level as a year ago. Debt is out of control due to 1% getting free money from GOP. Wages stagnant.

439 2018-10-31 19:38:42 Didn’t @NBCNews report that stocks would tank if Trump was elected? That did not happen. But can anyone tell me they didn’t say that?
440 2018-10-31 19:38:36 How can banning bump stocks be against the constitution?
441 2018-10-31 19:38:35 My expectation of 85k, then 80k hasn't changed. These are just minor waves inside a bigger one. Yes, for the last two days, I have been buying stocks with the intention of selling at 93-97k range. Then, I will go #short again. My stop-loss level is 87k for those I have bought.
442 2018-10-31 19:37:03 I don't think it matters who wins. Stocks probably rally after the election is over either way.

450 2018-10-31 19:34:27 Stocks are flat this WHOLE YEAR!

Bump stocks.

458 2018-10-31 19:29:36 The average American can't afford to buy stocks and are not offered 401ks through their jobs. Even if they got a private 401k most of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and can'taffird to out money in it. I am not ignorant on the facts.

464 2018-10-31 19:28:07 look for headlines about how it's the best single day performance in X index or sector in a long period of time. Those are the types of headlines we see in downtrends for stocks, not in uptrends. 3000 charts a week  Maybe listen to what JC @allstarcharts says

* Invest excess cash in real estate or stocks
474 2018-10-31 19:22:40 1. Currencies aren’t stocks bru. They aren’t suspended during frenzy trades.
2. The 5 trillion you keep quoting is made up of imports, exports, forward contracts, hedging positions, portfolio holdings, fin trades, swaps. Actual financial trading is less than 2 trillion!

476 2018-10-31 19:20:50 and CEOs are selling off their personal stocks to personally cash in on the high stock values, which they themselves created with corporate buybacks. Then they reinvest some of that winfall to GOPers like Portman to keep it flowing their way. Rest of us and our children...

I am sorry you have not received your Tote bag.  This offer was very popular and was a while stocks last promotion.  I am sorry if this was not added to your bag automatically we had already run out of stock. x
479 2018-10-31 19:20:12 Well 83% of stocks are owned by the top 10% of income earners.
480 2018-10-31 19:20:11 evetsoloccip The accounts are technically being moved over the weekend.  However, everything must be settled prior to the conversion. Stocks and ETFs have a two day settlement.  (1 day for options) Thus the respective blackout period.
481 2018-10-31 19:20:01 Nobody's going to stop Helene. That's how you get media attention. Nobody want's to hear "here's why stocks will go up 7% next year". Everbody wants to hear "here's why stocks will crash 30% next year"

486 2018-10-31 19:18:44 Imagine: Dems win House and Senate somehow, Trump is impeached, govt comes to a screeching halt and Kyle thinks... *squints*... stocks will go up. Okay then.

Steel stocks taking a hit with the tariffs, but where is it big picture since @Potus @RealdonaldTrump got into office?  How up are they from 1/1/17
488 2018-10-31 19:18:39 Stocks should not be used as a comparison. Other currencies or commodities work way better. Stocks have never had an extended bear market, actually, as our currency supply, GDP, and population have been consistently growing. That will never change

497 2018-10-31 19:13:59 Talk about having a high school education, I have clearly said that I know that Melissa did not vote to ban bump stocks and that she clearly gave her reason for that vote. Why do you continue to prove something I have agreed is true? You differ so what?

503 2018-10-31 19:11:23 Can't say I disagree. That's what the 14A says though.  I don't love interpretations of the 2ndA (bump stocks, semi automatics etc) but it says "the right to bear arms shall not be abridged".  Basically, the child has to leave with the parents right after birth. #BiggerProblems

506 2018-10-31 19:09:58 Stocks were really rocky last week. We saw a 900 point swing; a day that started with the DOW 350 points up suddenly saw it plummet to 550 points down.

For perspective, that swing is bigger than the largest pre-2018 1 day point loss in history; DOW dropped 778 on Sept. 29 2008.
507 2018-10-31 19:09:44 I invested early  in $FB, $AMZN, and $NFLX not because they are "FANG Stocks", but b/c they are monopolies which happen to still be led by their founders. In 2018, they trade in lock-step because market participants are stupid who fall for silly acronyms (including you).

539 2018-10-31 18:52:35 The most common weapon used in mass shootings has been a .38 revolver, statistically speaking. I think the only shooting involving a bump stock was Las Vegas but I’ve never thought bump stocks should be legal anyway. They are inaccurate and i wouldn’t put one on my rifle for free
540 2018-10-31 18:52:02 That 25 year old could have single payer healthcare and thus wouldn't need to be on their parents private insurance. But the Dems aren't interested in single payer, because it will affect the value of their insurance stocks and kickbacks.

624 2018-10-31 18:15:10 People are allowed to have political opinions but again when he is telling me how my stocks should perform with his prediction of a lame duck president that “they are hoping for”.  Makes me question their investment strategies.

628 2018-10-31 18:12:29 Jobs!

Economy!

Stocks are STILL in the green

Americans will remember #Kavanaugh and how the Democrats smeared him ..why aren't the Dems still investigating? ..why did the media totally drop the story?

You recently saw how the Dems blamed YOU for the bomber & Jew killer.

632 2018-10-31 18:11:06 A couple wouldn’t give up so was forced to answer, stocks low. Haha no chance of getting a sweet off you 
633 2018-10-31 18:10:20 Today many Wall Street Advisors are telling "long-term investors" to buy   OR hold stocks because they say in long run you are may make money (or   recover your losses).   It's like telling you to jump off the roof   because in the long-run your injuries will heal.
634 2018-10-31 18:10:12 Tom is fantastic as posting his research on companies he owns. You calling him a promoter is inaccurate. You sounds like a cry baby here. Don’t invest in penny stocks if you can’t handle the volatility $ipa.v.
635 2018-10-31 18:10:04 Still actual companies with products in demand can definitely come back. Cryptos / penny stocks might never.
636 2018-10-31 18:09:40 Agree bottom in stocks in. Bottom for gold in December likely.
637 2018-10-31 18:09:03 And how much do you know about the 14th amendment? Your style is below presidential. Shame on you. You want to attack the first amendment next? I’d rather focus and changing the 2nd to ban assault rifles and bump stocks.
638 2018-10-31 18:08:55 Yea just some unwarranted nerves, not to worry, stocks will go up forever!
639 2018-10-31 18:07:41 SPX almost into resistance. I have cut my stocks a bit, was def way too heavy in. Now debating puts or just short SPY.
640 2018-10-31 18:07:18 We got the bounce in #stocks at month-end. With S&P500 at 2730, I like the upside still but with this rally I am much more neutral than I was Monday and into Tuesday. You should have bought your list of names by now and you shorts it’s time to add to those now and into Nov.
641 2018-10-31 18:06:29 why don't you short stocks?
642 2018-10-31 18:06:03 New discrediting line of attack: Professor @KevinMKruse has substantial Orville Redenbacher stocks.
643 2018-10-31 18:06:00 They will but not due to Gold falling. Pullback due in stocks here shortly btw.

646 2018-10-31 18:04:21 $ISRG --  With two days of strong rallies, lots of leading stocks lifting higher today.  e.g.  Intuitive Surgical, up $33+.  '
647 2018-10-31 18:02:50 MAGA?? GM just announced buyouts (modern term for lay-off) for 18K salaried workers! Stocks of our Legendary American Automakers are at 8 years LOW! We are actually making Foreign Countries Great Again! Where is the promised 25% tariffs on Foreign Autos? Must protect our own.
648 2018-10-31 18:02:41 Come on... I didn’t say I would short and you know what i mean. I don’t short stocks
649 2018-10-31 18:02:00 like investing in stocks?

651 2018-10-31 18:01:05 I live in the district.  Lance is kind of "NeverTrump" so he winds up with no reason to vote FOR him.  The economy is doing well here; home prices are going up; many people here have done well with their stocks since Trump got in, very well.  But Lance runs on he's "bipartisan."
652 2018-10-31 18:00:47 Who would have thought the crypto market would look more stable than tech stocks over the last week

661 2018-10-31 17:57:15 I'm not going to post a long rant on how memory cycles work.. much smarter guys than me have written extensively about that. But the simple rule of thumb is to buy the stocks when capacity is starting to get idled/reduced.

664 2018-10-31 17:54:17 I disagree. The laughing stocks of the world are countries allowing unfettered, unvetted, unlimited immigration. And no I’m not high. I don’t do drugs. But knock yourself out though (literally lol)
665 2018-10-31 17:53:28 I can see their stocks crumble. My son will not buy their ice cream! I won't either. 
666 2018-10-31 17:53:05 so that means stocks go higher

682 2018-10-31 17:48:07 @OphirGottlieb what stocks did you pick up in this ugly October: ILMN, TWLO, etc?
683 2018-10-31 17:47:40 I own a mini-14 and an AR-15. Pistol grips, flash hiders, folding stocks, bayonet lugs... none of that matters in my opinion. What matters is they are both semi-autos capable of accepting high capacity magazines. It you want to ban something, ban that. The rest is fluff.
684 2018-10-31 17:47:38 This is for fresh food stocks. Grain and processed goods may be stockpiled for a few weeks worth. But the UK lacks these storage facilities, the population has increased since WW2. There are about 90 days of oil stocks and 2 years worth of nuclear fuel.
685 2018-10-31 17:47:17 That's the best thing about stocks.. you don't need to think at all (if you do, then you get bearish and underperform) - just let the Fed do all the heavy lifting for you.. right @fleckcap ?
686 2018-10-31 17:46:54 Not true, keeping you in office will make the stocks plunge deeper, you keep forgetting it was Obama's policies that repaired the damage done during the bush years, goes to show how much you've done

688 2018-10-31 17:46:07 هذا اكبر خطاء يقع فيه المتداول عدم تفعيل وقف الخسارة.  
قبل اي عملية شراء عليك تحديد وقف الخسارة قبل تحديد الهدف

697 2018-10-31 17:43:27 bar the odd stock over last 3 wks today L2s were alight. MM allowed rises and what i call the wave system. Of late not enough volume to close spread on many and buyers sell  there buys quickly to then see further drops. Today many stocks had 2 3 4 waves on L2. Hope it continues.
698 2018-10-31 17:42:58 It isn't an argument. It is math and entry level portfolio management. Being 50% of ADV is literally insane. People don't even do that with stocks. Doing that for crypto is almost a guarantee rekt in the long run

714 2018-10-31 17:30:26 You're a member of the resistance, no? Trump is pro life which I assume makes you pro choice.

No one is against background checks, it's mandatory for EVERY gun purchase. Raising the age to buy a gun won't stop violence. Banning bump stocks won't stop violence.

722 2018-10-31 17:28:27 @stocktwits Position yourself for strong future growth. Volatility may not be over. momentum stocks may adjust further as most will have slower growth next year due to an end to year v year tax benefits which adds 15% to growth this year.

724 2018-10-31 17:27:58 That may or may not be true because you have no idea what my position on abortion is. If you and NRA cared you would not be against background checks, raising age to 21 to own a gun, banning bump stocks and instead work to keep those mentally ill to get a gun. That’s hypocrisy.

745 2018-10-31 17:14:19 I think two things are going on. People are selling before earnings b/c that's just what some people do. I normally would too. I'm not because I have puts to offset selling that might happen. Second thing is people are probably moving money into the rally, into other stocks.

749 2018-10-31 17:12:38 Finally seeing some sign of a sentiment bottom soon. Some comments in daytrading chat saying wouldn't touch stocks right now (as we rally) is a good sign. Watching to see if UVXY breaks at support.

There indeed is social cost, and I'd certainly like to see it higher in the mix. But the treatment they gave it is totally on point. One expects an independent gov't broadcaster to either strike a tone similar to that of the gov't...

789 2018-10-31 16:57:24 Ok, lets put it this way, most of my friends make between 100-250k/yr ish. And when I ask who is invested in stocks I get a pan from most. Some dabble, but the majority of their money is just in savings or real estate tbh.

804 2018-10-31 16:51:44 What he said.  As a matter of fact, you can make more money when a stock is going down (because down trends sometimes last longer than uptrends). There's a thing called options that lets you leverage stocks when they drop (or go up) 100:1.

855 2018-10-31 16:19:52 By the way, the driver for the increase in values was the pound dollar rate and many stocks account in dollars, hence uplift. So GBP decline was not a negative.

881 2018-10-31 16:11:14 I don’t think boycotts or whatever from either side care enough to make an impact. Even when stocks dive they rebound in a week. Look at Nike.

883 2018-10-31 16:10:26 Last sentence - not really- if you are sharing will small retail traders it will have no effect. Maybe in a market with low volume sure- but not in ES or high liquidity stocks.

908 2018-10-31 16:02:17 When making bets on what will happen, it’s important to consider all that can happen!!

If you continue to chase ‘hot’ stocks, they will occasionally go down 50% from top, period. 

We’ve heard Buffett & Munger talk about that myriad times. 
Masters teach, we don’t heed!!
909 2018-10-31 16:01:58 That will be granny skeleton bob darth stock et al they have a list of about 5 stocks (all utterly woeful) to ramp, its just a case of which one today or this week. Bandits the lot of them

911 2018-10-31 16:01:00 @DRUDGE What is going on with Drudgereport? Stocks go down and it's everywhere in all red. Stocks correct themselves and it's one link at the bottom.

914 2018-10-31 16:00:39 Company earnings are great, employers salaries still stagnant. The 1% who own over 85% of the Wall Street stocks are building Scrooge McDuck style vaults and swimming in their cash.
915 2018-10-31 15:59:55 It does NOTHING for the 98% of the people.
Stocks are owned by the companies and CEO's.
You don't give a rat's ass about the regular guy.
916 2018-10-31 15:59:52 I'm trying to teach it new tricks..

Currently trick is to fetch stocks FAR away from peak 
917 2018-10-31 15:59:21 Well the crash will happen because quantitative easing and fractional reserve banking.. 250 bill printed quartlerly and propped into markets. The 08 bail out was a bandaid, nothing was fixed. debt is at all time highs, inflation, and stocks all caused by the fuckin fed.
918 2018-10-31 15:59:04 It is tough to keep up. USDA does change their numbers, but not to this extent. Argentina will slash the 3-years ago stocks in half all of a sudden.
919 2018-10-31 15:58:00 More like short term manipulation, you can’t hold Currencies manipulating as the same degree as stocks manipulation. You could easily figure out valuations by looking at bonds long term trading is easier especially with options.
920 2018-10-31 15:57:52 Unlike sweaters you actually can buy more of your favorite stocks when the ones you have are marked down. If nothing has changed except the price just means you’re luckier. The only thing you can control is the price you pay

933 2018-10-31 15:53:04 Sad, you don't understand business & merely conclude things basis the stock price.
90% PSU stocks, including banks have tanked & eroded humongous shareholders wealth, does that mean everyone's a crook?

942 2018-10-31 15:49:52 In all seriousness, presidents don't USUALLY affect stocks that much if earnings are good, etc. It would take a president dumb enough to start a trade war and increase the deficit to really have a negative impact. Oh, wait...

947 2018-10-31 15:48:51 Interesting that CVE has essentially no hedges for next year (~5% production is hedged for 2019) and they don't plan on increasing it. I love it! I find it foolish when oil companies hedge. It's a waste of money, and the stocks tank anyways when oil tanks.

1004 2018-10-31 15:29:06 Or...the bullets flying around could have caused even MORE deaths. Perhaps if the killers didn't have access to semi-automatic, high caliber weapons with high capacity magazines and bump stocks they would have been more limited.

1007 2018-10-31 15:27:02 I hold some U stocks that I know will never build a mine, but that's fine with me as long as I make good money. I have good running shoes, though...
1008 2018-10-31 15:26:37 SCOTUS also never ruled whether the framers had in mind bump stocks when they drafted 2A.
1009 2018-10-31 15:25:51 I cannot believe I made money off a pot stock my little brother tipped me onto $ACB. I am NEVER going to hear the end of this!  These pot stocks are very mercurial, so I swing in and out on a couple of them.
1010 2018-10-31 15:25:24 $AAPL has been able to avoid the recent bear raids on #tech leadership. If it get's hit, stocks gonna get rocked!

1011 2018-10-31 15:24:15 If you're bearish due to election outcome (Dems taking house/and or senate), know this;

The stock mkt actually likes a divided Washington. Stalemate. 

Why? A divided D.C. means any damage govt might do is limited. 

Bottom line; regardless of the outcome, stocks headed higher
1012 2018-10-31 15:24:04 The stock mkt is higher. Dow-25168/23539..Nas..6958/6295...Sp2717/2581. In addition my stocks are up another 20% gain for the year. Which makes my profit sharing up over 100% since Nov. 2016. I am not a Rep, or a billionaire. Works for me
1013 2018-10-31 15:22:36 "Weed stocks are an emotional rollercoaster of wtf do I even do anymore"
1014 2018-10-31 15:22:20 If there's profit to be had,take it now. Stocks/bonds sending bad signals. Market keeps going up based on nothing. GE paid 1 cent dividend. Stocks overpriced,bubble. Dividends suck.

1019 2018-10-31 15:19:36 For sure! Nothing special really - just bought stocks that had good after-hours earnings / breaking news for uptrend, had good technical support on the day and week, and were priced low on the curve.

1026 2018-10-31 15:16:23 There are #stocks moving up to new highs. But as long as the stock market in general is in a correction, these moves will be volatile. Better wait until a new broader trend in the stock market appears.
1027 2018-10-31 15:16:10 Trade wars, exploding deficit caused by tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, financial deregulations and rising interest rates are creating an economic crisis. Stocks have surrendered all of their hard won 2018 gains. #DonTheCon

1040 2018-10-31 15:10:50 So I'm taking an individualistic approach to the process - if you're listening to what other people say about stocks, you're already behind trend at that point. More about news, market sentiment, company valuation and trending for me. Do you trade at all Tim?

Of course, neither the average citizen nor the average employee of the companies whose stocks have benefited from last year's GOP Tax Scam is benefitting from the market but keep up the line of fertilizer, 
Something's bound to grow in it.
1052 2018-10-31 15:07:08 Nobody’s asked ME if I was “confident.” I’m not. I’m cashing out my stocks & paying off what little debt I have. I don’t want to be caught owing when it all comes tumbling down
1053 2018-10-31 15:06:30 Stocks can be a long term investment for the majority of working class Americans. The market will go back up. We’re not worried enough about it to make the mistake of voting for a republican. Peddle your fear bullshit elsewhere!

1055 2018-10-31 15:05:11 @dwyerstrategy @michaelsantoli   I’m just a novice, but leading technical indicators I use suggested yesterday was a buy on XLF, XLV,XLV and IWM.  Today a buy on XLI, XLK, and XLE.  Today’s sell-off of safety stocks confirming.  Concern is the VIX still above 20.  Time to buy?
1056 2018-10-31 15:05:09 If a so-called man is upset his female partner earns more than he, he needs to urgently grow a pair.  And I'm not talking about stocks
1057 2018-10-31 15:05:06 stocks running back proves my buy the dip strategy
1058 2018-10-31 15:05:05 The action of this is on the USD, that is where it gets interesting, right now stock market is a roller coaster of emotions. Look at TRY or ZAR, getting smashed by the US, maybe capital flight to US stocks during next 2-3 months + buybacks + Santa? Everything can happen here
1059 2018-10-31 15:05:02 Either your money is working for you or it’s working for someone else.

When you’re paying off debt and loans, that’s your money working for someone else.
When you’re invested in crypto/stocks, that’s your money working for you.

Make choices that keep your money working for you.

1087 2018-10-31 14:59:21 It’s an investment account. It takes loose change and puts it in stocks. I love it. Say you buy a Coke for $150. You use your linked card. It takes $.50 cents and puts it in round ups. After you get $5 in round ups. It invests in stocks . Adds up over time.
1088 2018-10-31 14:59:15 Some of us just buy good, fundamentally sound, gold and uranium stocks and go sit quietly in the back of the class until the bell rings.

1095 2018-10-31 14:56:38 The fact that anyone is willing to buy stocks, less than a week before a coin flip close midterm result, shows you just how overcrowded bull sentiment still is. That's not how real long term bottoms are formed.

1099 2018-10-31 14:55:44 The stock markets add incredible value to the lives of even those who will never own stocks.

The banking system adds incredible value to the lives of even those who will never have a bank account.

When Bitcoin adds value to the lives of nocoiners, you'll know it has arrived.
1100 2018-10-31 14:55:37 it is easy to prove, I just told you to Google it. Try the Bureau of Labor Statistics for employment and income and literally any financial journal for stocks.

1106 2018-10-31 14:53:59 It looks like it says something pillory is like stocks - people put in for punishment. In which case maybe the f word does say fornication?
1107 2018-10-31 14:53:50 Stocks down...interest rates up, tariffs threatening American farmers & businesses, inflation creeping in, National debt highest that its ever been. These wage “surges” will go to paying all of this off. Are they just Cost of Living Adjustment???
1108 2018-10-31 14:53:39 $MFIN earnings next week. Stock is moving up but earnings for the q are less important than a) the pref being done at the bank. This will be a HUGE positive! b) getting the $100 million non-recourse loan off the balance sheet. This equates to $4 per share in book value. #stocks
1109 2018-10-31 14:53:32 I'd consider it any large-caliber, long range weapon, with high cap magazines. There's a reason why the AR-15 is a favorite for mass murderers. Rapid-fiire mechanisms (ie bump stocks) and noise suppression devices should definitely be outlawed. Citizens shouldn't out-gun police.

Only commodities can now be really traded.

1234 2018-10-31 14:20:20 à mon avis c'est des stocks limités pour les promos
1235 2018-10-31 14:20:17 Spoiler Alert: Simply voting Democrat does not make stocks lose value. You have told a lie. beep boop!

1238 2018-10-31 14:19:28 I bought CHK, NG and will pull the trigger on RIOT today. Up 17% with EKSO.  A few stocks on sale. Enjoy the great @realDonaldTrump economy!
1239 2018-10-31 14:19:22 Before investing in anything outside $BTC, evaluate the “business model” and “#cryptoeconomics models”.  Look for established partnerships, value currently being created, and actual revenue.

Many #crypto orgs are extremely undervalued when compared to market caps of stocks, etc.
1240 2018-10-31 14:19:20 I hope your stocks are rising from the dead? 
1241 2018-10-31 14:18:49 You mean like how negatively he affected Nike?  Oh that's right... Their stocks hit record highs after that.  The only legitimate reason Kap isn't getting signed is being out of football for 2 years following a severe drop off in production.  Everything else is noise.

1243 2018-10-31 14:18:25 The so-called FANG stocks—Facebook, AMZN, Netflix and Alphabet—have lost nearly $430 billion in market value this month. That total would mark the group's largest monthly drop ever going back to Facebook's 2012 initial public offering.
1244 2018-10-31 14:18:22 In a market like this unless you’re in idiot it’s pretty easy to make money. I do my own investing based on information I get off the Internet and my stocks are up 27%!! Or you could invest in a very safe mutual fund and still makes 7 to 10%! Don’t give up on investing!
1245 2018-10-31 14:17:48 Mortgage Bonds look to open lower as Stocks build on yesterday's gains.

1250 2018-10-31 14:16:20 U.S. stocks open higher after strong earnings   10:13 AM EDT Oct 31, 2018
1251 2018-10-31 14:16:15 Can you imagine right wing heads exploding if President Obama had issued executive orders to require universal background checks for all firearms purchased in this country, including gun shows and private owner sales, or to ban assault rifles and bump stocks? #14th_Amendment
1252 2018-10-31 14:16:14 President DingleBerry stocks are not wages or secured retirement accounts, 401k funds are not liquid assets, fines and penalties for withdrawal I say thank you @BarackObama student loan reprieve, trump cancelled every advance #DJTScrewsUpEveerything @realDonaldTrump

1256 2018-10-31 14:15:07 Let's see how this plays out throughout the day; 10:14am 1,428 stocks are up from the open vs 1,717 that are down. 248 stocks are up 4% or more
1257 2018-10-31 14:14:50 The recent market volatility appears to be driven by investors rotating out of companies dependent on high growth like technology stocks. For example, a greater number of stocks actually advanced than declined on Monday.

1260 2018-10-31 14:13:50 apple stocks rise by 10%.
1261 2018-10-31 14:13:23 Megatech stocks up a ton, small caps lagging, homebuilders flat, dollar up is not what you want to see for this bounce to stick imo.
1262 2018-10-31 14:13:22 Retail stocks $XRT are taking the day off. They have been hot, so it is common to pause or pull back a little. $TGT, $WMT, $DG and $DKS are all on my day trading radar.
1263 2018-10-31 14:13:11 Sorry we don't have on-hand stocks anymore 
1264 2018-10-31 14:13:03 Wonder what % of his base actually own stocks ( I’m betting in the minority but they act like they became millionaires because trump told them it was good for them)
1265 2018-10-31 14:13:00 For Halloween this year I’ve decided to be a  & have just donated some blood with @GiveBloodNHS   . Stocks are very low so if you’re able to, please please donate. As always, very impressed by the kind, knowledgeable, hard-working staff   
1266 2018-10-31 14:13:00 You trump supporters ALWAYS want your opponents in jail. No she shouldn't and if she should, she would've been. People should have the right to own weapons. Nobody's trying to take away weapons. Ppl don't need AR-15 or bump stocks.

1270 2018-10-31 14:12:24 We dont know- which is frustrating because economic intuition would suggest it should matter. Best idea: incremental sale matters. If every store stocks the X,000 SKUs w/ highest velocity then everyone will have same SKUs. So they try to pick uniqueness too.
1271 2018-10-31 14:12:14 Believe what you will. We're making real progress with Korea.. where as Obama was leading us to a nuclear war. Stocks are way up and the economy is better than it ever was with Obama. Stop hating progress so much.
1272 2018-10-31 14:11:45 He knows as much as you know. In local finance industry #vanre is viewed as overvalued since 2014, brokers are suffering that people are sinking moneyz in depreciating assets instead of the Trump’s stocks on steroids. Rates are going up!
1273 2018-10-31 14:11:27 Right. We bought a small flat. The value is Double then of my Stocks currently but we are still investing in Stocks and in some years it will be 50 50 I guess.
1274 2018-10-31 14:11:19 Positive - Can sit there for hours alone charting
Neutral - Only interested in food stocks 
Negative - Often forget to enter trades after reading companies name, get paranoid that the market makers/exchanges are out to get me. Realize Im not connected to the internet 4 hours in.
1275 2018-10-31 14:10:52 Stocks!?? Have you seen it lately?? It’s because corps are buying back all their stock with the #TaxScam not because we’re purchasing goods and services. So that’s slowed down and the stock market is tanking. Korea??? Lolol. Un has continued to make his bombs ignoring trump. lol!
1276 2018-10-31 14:10:44 Would you like it if someone comes after you with an AR-15? I was also speaking of bump stocks that was used to commit mass murder in Las Vegas. I'd bet if ppl you love were victims of mass violence from an idiot with an AR-15, u may care more.
1277 2018-10-31 14:10:43 Today is a green day !! Stop sleepin on them stocks and get rich
1278 2018-10-31 14:10:22 Historically, when the market is in such turmoil, moves by stocks and sectors become tightly correlated. That, in turn, tends to spur investors to use bearish options on major indexes for protection from further losses.
1279 2018-10-31 14:10:22 “If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat” This should be #illegal for #POTUS to tell voters ahead of the midterms.

1281 2018-10-31 14:10:08 this feels like one of those buy stocks no matter what P/E ........
1282 2018-10-31 14:09:52 If stocks happen to go down today (unlikely) it's not because of the mythical "QT" but because funds don't want to make a bad month worse and they'll be forced to bail with this 115pt spx gain.
1283 2018-10-31 14:09:40 This earnings season, options investors are pricing in some of the biggest swings from specific stocks since 2015, They have been singling out names like Facebook and General Electric in expectation of outsize moves after earnings reports.
1284 2018-10-31 14:09:38 Many a time stocks they do buy and park in their diff prop account (which they are using for pnote also) on report / rebalancing time those prop book sells & client buys, to reduce impact..
1285 2018-10-31 14:09:35 New Strong Buy Stocks for October 31st
1286 2018-10-31 14:08:50 point is, nobody is buying these stocks for the first few months of .

1302 2018-10-31 14:04:49 When Trump loses midterm, he will stop harassing China. Then stocks will rise again. Therefore - if you want higher stock prices, vote for Democrats at all levels. #ResistTrump #VoteBlue 
1303 2018-10-31 14:04:39 Any excuse will rally it, the crowd is all bearish now cuz their stocks have gone down.
1304 2018-10-31 14:04:35 It's a great show
1305 2018-10-31 14:04:34 Lmao  yeah they might see a brief spike but historically the stocks plunge. NIKE is beginning to feel the effects as are others. Libs tend to listen to “dog whistles” and have no strength of conviction.
They’ll learn soon enough who the real fascist and racist are.

1306 2018-10-31 14:04:27 Not only is #MedicareForAll more humane. If you are solely motivated by traditional fiscal conservatism (a fiction but topic of another convo.) SPH will save $$ & result in more efficient outcomes, reduce worker sick days etc.

Profiting off of health care via stocks is immoral.

1329 2018-10-31 13:58:08 That there, my friend, is worth so much more than watching stocks going up and down, as you know. Enjoy!
1330 2018-10-31 13:58:07 That cannot be. NCPB has the know-how and the facilities to manage the stocks up-to capacity for donkey years. It has dryers, silos,  sufficient warehouses, the skilled manpower,  how does it become unfit under one year? No.  I cannot be fooled. Did we buy and pay for air?
1331 2018-10-31 13:57:45 It’s cause people are used to google stocks on top of each other rather than primary imagery

1335 2018-10-31 13:56:29 3 reasons $EXAS should be on your watch list: 1. Strong stock with rapid growth and positive reaction to earnings. 2.

1360 2018-10-31 13:49:50 NEW RULE:

No one is allowed to talk shit about CEOs.

If you don't like them, don't buy their company's stuff or stocks.

If you think they're driving the company to the ground, show your short positions first.

(Or keep them to yourself and shut up like a good trader would).

$BTC is 10 years old now. 
Mostly none of the other projects are older than 3-4 years max. 

Apple 10th anniversary: 1986. 
Microsoft: 1985. 

Since then: +100.000% on both. 

Insane growth and also massive adoption. 

Be patient.
1371 2018-10-31 13:46:29 Worst month since the financial crisis.  Stocks down huge.  Are you creating another financial crisis?

1374 2018-10-31 13:46:17 It has been a brutal month for fund managers. So expect them to do anything and everything in their power to ramp stocks higher so they can end the month with the best possible returns. After that, it’s game over.

1392 2018-10-31 13:41:33 Market is oversold, $TSLA was green the entire time while the market turn red. When other stocks are bouncing back, money follows, drying up the liquidity short term unless big money jump in. Fed meeting Nov 7/8 for interest rate hike and 10Q delay hmmm.
1393 2018-10-31 13:41:33 4. Continued. Move towards more defensive stocks, etfs ...and look for better opportunities
1394 2018-10-31 13:41:23 1. What is your allocation per trade? lower your percentage from say 7% per trade to say 3% to 4%.

2.If youre selling premium try to stretch out your standard deviations.

3. Guage your expected losses

4. Not all stocks, etfs and currency have the same volitality etc...

1406 2018-10-31 13:37:53 By the same token, those stocks above the line are “over valued” relative to the others, but not sure I’d sell/short them. Illustrates the issues with a simplistic quantitative view of valuation.
1407 2018-10-31 13:37:48 Last time I looked the stock market has been pretty volatile. Corp earnings are up which is good if you have stocks - an IRA or 401 BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL OF US WHO DON’T ?? Typical Republican cheer!!! More $ for the “haves” and the “have nots” Oh well too bad for you - thanks Trump!

1419 2018-10-31 13:35:31 True. However, be aware some companies limit the funds/ stocks you can choose for your company sponsored 401K because they fear potential risk management issues. Best advice: educate yourself & know your options.

1429 2018-10-31 13:32:20 Please tell me you are not this misinformed?

Wages have been rising for the last year, stocks are up, unemployment is lowest it has ever been for Hispanics, Blacks, Asians, and the Debt was on track for a historic high due to the ludicrous new programs by Obama, left to Trump
1430 2018-10-31 13:32:13 For very large markets, such as #Forex and #Stocks, this isn't as important... unless the "manager" acquires some SERIOUS management money. However, I don't think retail managers will have a problem. However, for $crypto, this is huge due to thin order-books & low liquidity.

1439 2018-10-31 13:29:27 (like banning bump stocks/silencers, etc). Insanity is trying the same things over and over again and expecting a different result- basically what America’s been doing for YEARS when it comes to gun violence.

1458 2018-10-31 13:24:10 Donald, that line going down means stock prices are falling. That means companies and people who own stocks are losing value.
1459 2018-10-31 13:23:38 April and October traditionally low months. People who get to upset about every wiggle and bump in stocks should invest in something else.
1460 2018-10-31 13:23:29 $spx #stocks European stocks up is not all clear sign. They’re up from weak EUR & inflation. Those are good for nominal returns on their stocks but negative for US stocks IMO.

1464 2018-10-31 13:22:19 I've solved this problem by decimating the stocks entirely over the past two weeks. Built a supermarket run into my day-of routine years ago.
1465 2018-10-31 13:22:08 Donald Trump praised the rebound in the stock market and added that the companies' quarterly results contributed to the recovery of US stocks. "Stock Market up more than 400 points yesterday. Today looks to be another good one" He's prob having a quick scalp long on the toilet.
1466 2018-10-31 13:21:37 Today everyone will feel like an investing genius as their stocks go back up. Sit down. You're not that smart! Now is exactly when you need a little humility. But it's still going to be an enjoyable day as we all let out a collection sigh of relief!

1469 2018-10-31 13:20:59 There is a solid argument to be made that #oil companies should be nationalized and wound down.  #Divestment isn't just a moral issue.  Smart investors will sell oil stocks because there is at least some risk they are going to zero for political reasons. #strandedassets
1470 2018-10-31 13:20:57 $CLVS is the greatest breakdown of our time. I say that because everybody was wrong. Analysts, institutions, and of course retail. This differs from the $sgyp, $neos, $arlz and other dogs of the world bc those are primarily retail cult stocks

1472 2018-10-31 13:20:31 A few of the trading strategies I place in stocks mainly focus on volatility drop (e.g. earnings trades), however the positional ones in index rely mainly on theta decay with vol drop being desirable but not 100% necessary. The ones I deploy intraday are mostly about theta.
1473 2018-10-31 13:19:40 I hope one day we find the identity of these donators and put them in stocks in the internet town square so we can all throw digital tomatoes at them. They deserve to be public shamed for this high degree of beta-orbiting

1485 2018-10-31 13:15:23 I've been investing in small cap stocks for 2 years now and knowing when to sell is hard to judge right, sometimes its just a gut feeling based on sentiment for the particular share. If in doubt sell when in profit and don't be greedy.
1486 2018-10-31 13:13:47 @etrade any update on what's going on w/ level 2 quotes for OTC stocks?
1487 2018-10-31 13:13:40 Am I the only one that can see, while you’re tweeting about great times in the stock market.... you’re dumping all your stocks/bonds on your fellow citizens while sit there with your sinister hand sign?
1488 2018-10-31 13:13:27 Nope! He probably gets a report on how the stock market is doing and seen that it’s going up. Stocks are doing better then when Obama was in office.
1489 2018-10-31 13:12:45 Stock market is negative for the year...
Down 2000 points in October...

Don't pick and choose the numbers you want to report. Stocks and 401k are getting destroyed due to you.
1490 2018-10-31 13:12:02 Obviously you don't have any stocks.
1491 2018-10-31 13:11:41 Say what you want about President Trump, but you have to admit, he's one of a kind!  Tweeting about an up day in the stock market on the last day of one of the worst performing months for stocks in the last decade, in a year where stocks are flat with 2 months left.  Mind blown!
1492 2018-10-31 13:11:13 Down for the year. Additionally, why don’t you tweet when the stocks go down? Oh I know, your base won’t like that. I get it...
1493 2018-10-31 13:10:22 STOCKS:  Big push by Wall Street (republicans) to get investors to buy stocks.  Republicans do not want October to show one of the worst monthly declines going into midterms.  Republicans want a strong stock market going into elections
1494 2018-10-31 13:09:06 if ever you wanted proof a trade deal would get done in 5 seconds if stocks went down, this is it
1495 2018-10-31 13:08:55 It’s just a damn shame that there’s so many Americans struggling week to week that could not ever afford stocks and bonds. Working two jobs to make ends meet. But you’re so out of touch you think everybody was born with stocks & bonds coming out their asses like you did DOTARD...

1497 2018-10-31 13:08:30 Stop tweeting about this. It has nothing to do with most people since only 10% of Americans own 85% of stocks. Not relevant to working people dealing with increased health care costs.

1615 2018-10-31 12:22:14 Solid #ADP report ..gains in all the right spots..bonds shrugging it off for the most part ..stocks seeing good news as good news..
1616 2018-10-31 12:22:09 Must of run out of stocks. Why the f@@k they need to do this is beyond me.
1617 2018-10-31 12:20:08 This Halloween, it’s not a Hollywood monster bringing the fright to investors: It’s a whole cast of scary characters, including trade tensions, tech disappointments, rising interest rates, and wild swings in China’s markets. The panic is overstated and U.S. stocks look ripe!
1618 2018-10-31 12:20:05 Stocks have gone up between   300% to 2000% since March 9, 2009 and some people crying now when they see some of their stocks drop 20% to 30% from their ATH levels!!! Seriously?  Really?  Do you guys see what I see?
1619 2018-10-31 12:19:42 Bump stocks can be made at home. And the guy that killed the 11 Jews hated Trump. There was also a mass shooting by a Democrat at a ball field full of Republicans where Steve Scalice almost died. So I don’t get your point
1620 2018-10-31 12:19:12 He’s replying to a tweet about Defense stocks specifically
1621 2018-10-31 12:18:38 So it would be bad for the GOP if stocks were higher?
Bwahahaha...this not transparent scare tactic bullshit at all.
 No worries Hugh. No one saw through this nonsense. No one at all.
1622 2018-10-31 12:16:48 They are telling stocks to avoid 
1623 2018-10-31 12:15:49 Liar, the stock market went up 240% under Obama. Stocks are flat for the year, that’s a 10 month pause
1624 2018-10-31 12:15:48 Yes.  I really like CEO Dan Major.  But they need lots of cash to go into production.  Govi left himself so it is a Red Flag.  I just dont see why one would risk them when we have a few platinum stocks here with almost no risk that will benefit from the S232 unlike GoviEX.

1629 2018-10-31 12:14:14 What do u do for a job ? Since when does a coward get to judge others openly ? I'm aware that stocks are akin to gambling.

1635 2018-10-31 12:10:46 Hey I’m new to investing in stocks. I hold about 5K shares of eomn since I plan on holding for a while will my shares automatically change over to new symbol  if/when that takes place?
1636 2018-10-31 12:10:34 except 100x's scarier because people aren't shooting revolvers at eachother. Now we get large volume mags, and bump stocks. What a world.
1637 2018-10-31 12:10:02 Whether Mr Patel stay or not I don't believe in any really of market because of we are under threat of many macro and micro aspects. FII has sold highest ever stocks in Oct 2018 since last 26 years. They are not come back as quickly as we think.
1638 2018-10-31 12:08:59 Hopefully a 'Buy' signal heralding a recovery in those weaker stocks. Financials have been hit hard, valuations are rock bottom, yields are eye-watering. House builders ditto.
1639 2018-10-31 12:08:52 Again, you don't know me, my values or my incentives so please, don't flatter yourself believing you do. I buy stocks and support companies who are helping society and improving life.  And yes, I have profited from it, deal with it. By the way, @StJude does amazing work too.
1640 2018-10-31 12:08:14 Totally agree, I've been introduced to some fantastic stocks I wouldn't have come across by myself. I've even missed out on the initial rise whilst I conducted my own research. Some stocks are up, some are down; the down one's mainly due to the market. Keep em coming I say.

1644 2018-10-31 12:07:14 If you can circumvent the constitution and ban bump stocks, why can't you ban birthright citizenship? Remember when they ban guns Trump will have all the weapons at his fingertips.
1645 2018-10-31 12:07:03 Correction, semi auto guns & bump stocks. & if your logic is that the potency & lethalness of guns today is the same as they were in the days when the Constitution was drafted then there’s no point having the conversation. Finally, air travel is not mentioned in the Constitution.
1646 2018-10-31 12:04:25 The scariest thing this Halloween would be if M9-M0 trades all the way up to the mid 20's again and I'm not long spreads for it.  That is the stuff of nightmares.  And if stocks come all the way back, believe me, it will trade up there again and higher.
1647 2018-10-31 12:04:20 by screwed up gun laws I mean things like bump stocks and open commerce without proper background checks
1648 2018-10-31 12:03:48 Buy stops are triggering across the board at the open. Has the correction run its course?  At least for today, it looks like it.

1663 2018-10-31 11:55:22 It's Q3, it's normal. There is no "real down." It will end up showing larger "growth" when Q4 is over. 

If you follow stocks, most people sell Q3 anyways. Compare it to Campbell's soup, Nike stock is still legit. Kap has been their guy for years anyways.

1667 2018-10-31 11:54:20 I recommended that clients liquidate both US stocks and Treasuries at end of August and convert to USD cash.

1668 2018-10-31 11:54:04 You know what's cool, when you dig up a birds habitat to power fossil fuel power plants which pumps out greenhous gases which increase water temperatures affecting fish stocks and melting ice which raises sea levels which flood wetlands where migratory waterbirds rest.

Buying since 08 and selling before election, and buying back in after election was a smart move. Selling a portion when the stocks broke the all time high longest bull run and moving into bitcoin will look like a powerful move in 1-4 years.

1722 2018-10-31 11:20:50 I suggest Americans vote Democrats. Energy stocks are all so low , investors lost up to 40% . And most U.S. Corp. stocks are down.  It cannot get worst with Democrats. If we hear in the next days stock market goes up. Their is so much money loss that it s too late and fake ups.

1734 2018-10-31 11:11:53 I was a student back in 2009, but 2009 took about anything down because of bank-scandals, gold, silver and oil did it ok. 2014 i finished studies and then was the first time ever i baught stocks. Some are still in my wallet: $googl $aapl, $ea and $isrg these 4 now still going up!
1735 2018-10-31 11:10:52 I made 300% last time on the way up, mostly luck though. Worth learning about for sure especially since we are due for another financial collapse. Alt currency could do well if stocks crash again

1738 2018-10-31 11:09:02 The first thing we need to see from a risk-management perspective is a market that is not in free fall.

No free fall Tuesday... let's see if stocks can make it through today's session without impersonating a waterfall.

1747 2018-10-31 11:05:47 Trump accepting responsibility for the downturn in stocks
1748 2018-10-31 11:04:35 the way I look at it is simple, and as a long term investor, there is always a good deal to invest in. With the pull back this month at over 10% and some funds 20% I feel there is some good tech stocks to pump and dump. Markets only going up until 2020.. no risk no reward...
1749 2018-10-31 11:04:17 Ditto! Wait till I tell my sister who spends a ton on B & J's!  Stocks will plummet!
1750 2018-10-31 11:03:26 Well, me, like 90% of americans dont have an investment in stocks...so that doesn't really apply. Be nice to have healthcare and better wages tho, why dont you do something about that?
1751 2018-10-31 11:02:40 Assistance for ? Sadly u r right capital markets r dominated by Chinese. But to be honest even I don't invest. I'm not sure how halal it is to play stocks. So I just do unit trusts which r Syariah compliant.
1752 2018-10-31 11:02:06 Shorts are, as you very well know, the only ones that has to buy stocks. Longs can decide not to.
1753 2018-10-31 11:01:42 Well I can tell you right now if trump loses in 2020 I’m selling massively.

And during the election I moved money to cash....and the night of the election I went all in on trump stocks.

Best decision.

It was a repeat of Ronald Reagan and I wasn’t going to miss the run!

1784 2018-10-31 10:31:52 QE went to the rich and they svedit or bought Stocks or real estate.  Money is locked up amonst the rich.  Govt spending splashes it around more, so it gets spent in other industries.
1785 2018-10-31 10:31:44 We'll see soon enough. Most trading circles I'm a part of believe the drop in stocks is just a quick correction. We'll have to see if returning stock buybacks can keep this sinking ship afloat.

1794 2018-10-31 10:21:33 Don’t think that the market tumblr is unrelated to the outcome of the midterms. A Democrat win in the house would be disastrous for stocks. The volatility we are seeing in the markets is a reflection of the polls which predict a split in Congress.

"Buy any EFC Bobble or Bucket hat & use code FREETOFFEES & we will send you a FREE #EFC hat too (expires 01/11/18, while stocks last).  “

So you purchased two and get two free. 

Would you like me to refund one?

1856 2018-10-31 09:44:46 Just Now he disclosed that He is not responsible for Stock price up and Down only respectable for analysis..but for that also not responsible for stocks up and Down..Then why always claim..Maine Bola tha???and Recap whole day
1857 2018-10-31 09:44:19 Too much analysis is paralysis. Look at most of the Nifty top 50/100 stocks. They are trading near their long term trendline support zones post the fall. That will be a good indicator as well
1858 2018-10-31 09:44:04 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
1859 2018-10-31 09:44:00 Phew! Pulled off an online launch of our latest collection in just one day, and with crappy internet at that. Now my problem is how to keep stocks coming in cause stocks are flying off virtual shelves faster than they come from production

1867 2018-10-31 09:40:25 RT:( @JimCramer): The attacks are about people who bought stocks on their own and blame me. I say sell all cannabis stocks except $CGC --great call, but you had to do both. Buy Amazon from $175 to $1750 and they buy at $1750. They don't listen to the context or history …
1868 2018-10-31 09:40:14 It is not unusual, racy momo stocks have been whacked, the same happened in dot com. This bull market has been lead by tech stocks so one needs to study history i.e. dot com to understand how and why It is playing out like this imo

1870 2018-10-31 09:38:50 We had Paul Ryan talking about he benefits of cbd. A majority of republican voters even now support legalization. The USA stocks are where Canadians were a couple years ago.
1871 2018-10-31 09:38:01 European stocks have now clawed back all of last week's losses, but the U.S. and Japan are not there yet. Have we seen peak Europe-pessimism?
1872 2018-10-31 09:37:20 The Vegas shooter fire 1000 rounds approximately, and only killed 58. The reason no on uses bump stocks is that they make guns terribly inaccurate. Second, most high rise hotels have shatter proof windows preventing suicides. This one did not. Why?
1873 2018-10-31 09:37:16 Another strange anecdote on this Market is how formerly Strong Stocks have been whacked whereas Stocks that were already weak have often barely been hit. That's unusual. I suspect Valuation is that driver.
1874 2018-10-31 09:36:46 Stocks? Me. Nah.
1875 2018-10-31 09:35:47 Bulls have taken the control or not?can start buying stocks?
1876 2018-10-31 09:35:29 Okay I dunno if @jamesmurua still deals with stocks but I would recommend him if not he could direct you to someone who does.
1877 2018-10-31 09:34:20 The stocks are doing fantastic under corporate owned Republican control. The stocks are not the people.
1878 2018-10-31 09:33:57 I have stocks of root beer at my house.  If I can, I would love to drink it all the time 
1879 2018-10-31 09:32:08 Haha true true, I’d like to know how people know where to get in before the rally but I guess that’s investing instead of trading. Do you only do stocks or options as well?
1880 2018-10-31 09:31:42 So what will happen to the shareholders who bought stocks through BseL. Will they loss it all kana they jst continue being part of the retail giant.
1881 2018-10-31 09:31:15 Well, it's crypto... It's pretty reasonable to think it may recover spectacularly. With stocks not so much. They already had such an amazing ride and growth over the years. With more decent crypto you may be fine but one needs to be more careful about stocks
1882 2018-10-31 09:30:19 Hello this is preorder so I don't have stocks! But don't worry there are slots yet to be taken :)

1884 2018-10-31 09:28:40 Third war: some idiots thinks they know what went wrong with the first two wars. They declare war. Stocks crash 75% or more. They try it anyway. It doesn't work.

And that's it.

1887 2018-10-31 09:27:54 Second war: War is declared. Stocks crash. As in, lose about half their value overnight. War is desperately prosecuted in an attempt to recover. It doesn't work.
1888 2018-10-31 09:27:39 - means stocks down right?
1889 2018-10-31 09:24:14 Reserve stocks can compensate for shortfalls in foreign currency (which make imports difficult), offset supply shocks or spikes in demand, & facilitate humani- tarian response to food emergencies.

1896 2018-10-31 09:14:47 That summarize it pretty good. US Stocks are not in a bear market yet though - and a reversal now is not unlikely. 

Remember that October is the most volatile month - on top of that we have US midterm election, which have created some uncertainty.

1920 2018-10-31 09:00:17 The last paragraph summaries it pretty well: buybacks and dividends since the bull market started in March 2009 equivalent to 40 percent of the value that stocks in the S&P 500 Index added during that stretch.

1932 2018-10-31 08:53:07 Perhaps those stocks should be owned by all people in fair share because they work in them. They create their value.

1934 2018-10-31 08:51:12 interesting to see drip fed sells in stocks that haven't delivered news for a while  - that shows a lack of research especially if the market cap vs value proposition has improved  - understand need to protect capital but some real value plays to buy top-up.

1981 2018-10-31 08:16:13 In 2016 I thought it would be cool (and cost effective) to not own a car in Los Angeles, after totaling my Uber receipts out of curiosity, that thought cost me over $30k in Uber rides.  Moral of the story, there is such a thing as a bad idea, and @Uber should give me some stocks!
1982 2018-10-31 08:15:34 stocks are up 8,000 points since the donald took office. 25% a year increase. count your good fortune.
1983 2018-10-31 08:15:33 I’ve been contacted to say I can now have it next Monday. What I don’t like,  is judging by what I’ve heard on here, Pharmacies & S/ Mkts where you pay seem to have stocks, but doctors a shortage

2003 2018-10-31 07:52:01 Organized optimism: "Investors dumped expensive growth stocks in October, as the ASX slumped to its worst monthly loss for more than three years, leaving fund managers hopeful that the way is now clear for an end of year rally."

2005 2018-10-31 07:49:36 We know that the Tualatin location only stocks 4 cans of Citracel at a time at the most. When hubby is down to only 1, I buy whatever is there IF there is any. Tough for someone that has to have it due to medical issue. I end up going to Walmart, they always have it.

South African markets closed in the red yesterday, pulled down by losses in mining a 117 stocks closed higher, 129 closed lower and 181 were unchanged. The All Share fell by 1.1% 
What to watch today
2011 2018-10-31 07:36:59 Yes it's true that the open can be pretty crazy w/ high vol and difficult to trade. Waiting some time after the open is also smart, a lot of my bigger gains have come from stocks that have massive open vol -> consolidate -> make new highs, higherlows -> breakout again later
2012 2018-10-31 07:33:45 ive always wanted to talk about how the third telco stuff affects the prices of stocks and how people make money from it everytime i see it on news but meh my friends would just get bored. i always sound alien daw when i talk about stocks #traderproblems #cantconnect

2016 2018-10-31 07:32:42 Asia equities up on the last day of October follow a good session for US stocks. Dow +1.8% and a 'decent earning reports' by FB help sentiment.

2036 2018-10-31 07:16:02 FFS how much are high stocks worth? The economy isn’t great anyway but I don’t care how good it is, if it means having a presidential administration that kisses up to dictators, passes tax cuts for the rich, and refuses to work on affordable healthcare
2037 2018-10-31 07:14:32 Good question of course value is often in the eye of the beholder -but it is often unfashionable or neglected stocks and sectors that get the value label.

2151 2018-10-31 05:49:24 Stocks going down isn't necessarily a bad thing. The market is adjusting. Because stocks drop doesn't necessarily mean the markets are crashing, just that the money is shifting. Input costs for companies are higher, meaning more money is going to the workers. Not a bad thing.

2165 2018-10-31 05:41:19 You don't know the truth behind those unemployment numbers do you?

Obama was a zero in everthing except lying

2185 2018-10-31 05:27:15 It’s a correction, from the overinflation of stocks early this year from tax cuts that caused a run on the market from buy-backs.

Same applies to charts. Keep your charts simple, and focus on 2-3 key indicators. Dont make your chart look like :"Khichdi"

2208 2018-10-31 05:09:46 The top 10 percent of Americans own 84 percent of the stocks.... only 27% of the middle class own ("significant" - $10k or more) stocks...
 As long as you and your rich cronies get fatTER - that's gotta be good for the country... that's ALL you can "see" - isn't it.... 
2209 2018-10-31 05:08:37 I agree. Industries are more prone to rest their stocks on the currency and the state of America’s economical standings. The stability of the currency matters. When that gets disturbed then the chain will get distorted down the line.

2217 2018-10-31 05:02:16 Mexico's biggest publicly-traded stocks lost another $5 billion Tuesday, following $17.5 billion Monday.

That brings total stock losses since AMLO's airport announcement to ~$22.5 billion -- nearly enough to pay for the Texcoco project 2 times over.
2218 2018-10-31 05:02:16 Desperation! When you see stuff like this, you are  accosted with an informed instinct that government indulging in such bribery has taken stocks of its impacts, seen the daring consequences due to errors committed and now seeking to induce pple with unpopular measure! Shameful!

2227 2018-10-31 04:54:40 There is a rapid progression of the stock index since the election 2016, but now there is  a little momentary slump in the stock market as the people want to see the impact of mid term election. And if you want your stocks go down, there is a strong suggestion to voting Democrat.

2292 2018-10-31 04:03:58 Kinda funny how short term issues affect stocks that much. Entire country went legal, that alone is a feat. Even if sales are slow, we are still selling out. Will look forward to seeing Canopy unload that 100m inventory.
2293 2018-10-31 04:03:51 After turning 30 I’ve realized it’s smart to get into stocks and buy a trillion shares of any anti acid company.
2294 2018-10-31 04:03:30 Both. It brings out Trumps satire very well on normal stocks chart.
2295 2018-10-31 04:02:44 USD/JPY takes out 112.80 resistance and now a 113 handle. Another sign of a pending rally in stocks. In fact, it may already be under way.
2296 2018-10-31 04:00:06 Clearly we’ve underestimated Gold Coast’s midfield stocks
2297 2018-10-31 03:59:38 Correct..  stocks turning down sharply will affect earnings, but tend to lead in both directions
2298 2018-10-31 03:59:05 The last time WTI rallied despite a big build (8 mil bbl) in US crude stocks was on Oct 3, a Wednesday. That was *before* the stock markets turmoil took hold and was almost an aberration. It also proved to be short-lived -- WTI tanked by nearly twice as much the next day.
2299 2018-10-31 03:58:52 Big day for stocks tomorrow. For absolutely no reason.
2300 2018-10-31 03:58:38 A little pause my ass. Our gains for the year are gone and then some.  If you want your stocks to keep going down, vote republican.  They like tariffs & trade wars.
2301 2018-10-31 03:56:53 Indian #stockmarket is #sellonrise. Use the #Nifty relief rally to get into 100% cash.  No point showing loyalty to stocks. Money is all that counts.
2302 2018-10-31 03:56:46 A good position to be in. And a lot better than sitting with stocks and selling at a loss. Well done! Brings me joy seeing people in our community get ahead knowing it will mean better quality of life for them and those they love.

2306 2018-10-31 03:52:44 You are not the president of the stock market, or the president of the portion of the country that buys stocks. Do you see how you might be failing massively at your jobs?

2313 2018-10-31 03:48:54 The problem right now with CDN #weedstocks, IMO, is visibility. $CGC FY rev downgrade by GMP throws cold water on sector hitting numbers near-term. Canna stocks were priced to grow into forward-looking valuations immediately. Sadly, that's been delayed by supply chain issues.
2314 2018-10-31 03:48:01 I support the law which it is sort of a loop hole but it’s a law. I am not for two parents that are none US Citizens to fly to the US just to have a baby to get their US Citizenship through chain migration. Just like I am not for bump stocks turning a gun into a fully auto.
2315 2018-10-31 03:48:00 advice to all of twitter, investing your money into 401ks, stocks, bonds, mutual funds = good thing. i wouldn't recommend trading options until you know what the risks are and know what you're doing. it took a LOT of research until i finally understood the concept of options.

2317 2018-10-31 03:47:05 What is a "value" stock right now anyway? Something like $goog is way cheaper than $pg right now. So basically "value stocks" right now means oil stocks and banks. Good luck with that. I'll stick to buying more $goog.

2453 2018-10-31 02:32:42 Ah yes, so when it'll be 130 and when your leaving the WTO and over-fishing shared stocks...as your saying when the inflation hits...as your flame-filled future of little trade...

2459 2018-10-31 02:29:02 Look I know they're a tell and all but are stocks even a real commodity?  Like playing casino with corporate ownership, where is the real value in any of this.  If you're going to own a part of a corporation, own a local one.  Profits may be lower and losses higher but value...
2460 2018-10-31 02:28:25 Hi. Unfortunately, we do not seem to have stocks of that particular boxed set left. You may try other Harry Potter sets instead. Thank you.
2461 2018-10-31 02:27:34 90% of your base do not even own stocks.
2462 2018-10-31 02:26:45 Coming from @Vanguard_Group it’s pretty much always going to be, ETF’s and mutual funds and I probably don’t even need to read the article. Yep, just keep on going for that average return. Or stay in the top stocks and watch the inevitable.
2463 2018-10-31 02:25:43 ma pukinam ng privè naka ilang email na ako pinasa lang ako sa dmop ba yun yung store sa hk tapos nag email din ako dun asking if may stocks at 32usd din ba price aba di sumasagot 
2464 2018-10-31 02:23:20 There are 6 species of seal around our coast. There >10 MILLION seals. As a result of the efforts of these radical enviro interest groups our ocean is now over populated w/ seals depleting wild fish stocks. We should harvest seals sustainably & be proud of it. Eat it and wear it.
2465 2018-10-31 02:22:31 It's a good bet! But the running joke in my options trading circle thru 10yr bull market is: "Fed's got your back" meaning as long as they can print money n pour it into stocks, thing can stay irrational. But ya, sold sum stocks early last yr/put in2 BTC, LTC, ETH, +. LTC my fave
2466 2018-10-31 02:22:20 Btw what exactly is meant by not working for someone else? As a founder, would not I be working for my customers etc? Perhaps if you are only trading/investing in stocks for yourself, then this applies. Basically if I am the only consumer of what I "produce".
2467 2018-10-31 02:20:41 U.S. Market Check

    U.S. stocks ended a tumultuous day sharply higher, with all major averages rising at least 1.4 percent as volatility continues to grip equity markets during earnings season.
2468 2018-10-31 02:20:25 Asian stocks traded mixed on the last day of a bruising month after a topsy-turvy U.S. session that eventually saw equities rally.

Shares in Tokyo climbed, were little changed in Australia and slipped in South Korea. Futures in Hong Kong pointed to modest losses.
2469 2018-10-31 02:20:13 4 DIFFERENT anchors/Contributors on TV Tues said definitively that indices HAD to go lower to get the capitulation before stocks can move higher. These folks, who DON"T typically opine on market direction, ALL having said this with certainty..should be a concern to bears #Hmmm
2470 2018-10-31 02:20:08 @timothysykes thank you for being transparent for posting your wins and losses. As you said when you win you grow your monetary account and when you lose you grow your knowledge account. Thanks

Our forefathers never could've imagined the kind of fire power available today. They only knew of muskets & single shot pistols.

2489 2018-10-31 02:09:28 IMO it's best now to build your own fund of the best cos for speculation, but I think $URA will still take off when the rest of the #uranium stocks do because it's about the only US option for large & institutional investors to get diversified exposure to the sector w/ one click
2490 2018-10-31 02:09:24 All the stock market gains have been lost. Am I missing something? Your trade wars and your tax cuts to corporations which artificially bolstered the stock market via buy backs are coming home to roost. VOTE blue to save America and the (real) economy. Stocks benefit the wealthy.
2491 2018-10-31 02:08:58 Yes-the tax cuts have been proven not to have created a sustained change in the economy. Most businesses took it and used it to buy back stocks which is great for the shareholders and does nothing for anyone else.
2492 2018-10-31 02:08:48 Just so y’all know, your twitter draft stocks drop more and more with every slanderous candy corn tweet
2493 2018-10-31 02:07:55 Yea the stocks market dropped so bad..now today finally came up 73%which ain't shit
2494 2018-10-31 02:07:09 Thank you, I needed good laugh.
October been crazy for socks. Damn autocorrect! Stocks.
2495 2018-10-31 02:06:53 I welcome your concern - ironically am on jury duty this week. The bastards who tried to out wife and children need put in stocks outside Holyrood. (Hence the bloody moniker.) What idiots to think I'd meekly consent to censorship, and what sadness to see the SNP capitulate.
2496 2018-10-31 02:06:27 @shahbazz0 99% of my trades are stocks under $4.00

2498 2018-10-31 02:06:08 Am I seeing junk stocks flying? Who is buying them? Not so good. Maybe, the fall is not yet over.
2499 2018-10-31 02:05:43 @top008 elections don't matter much when you trade stocks under $4.00 like I do.
2500 2018-10-31 02:05:39 But a truck is so hard to get into the classroom or synagogue. Also you'd have to steal it, or licence and rent. And trucks WILL stop once you get enough bodies under them. 

Las Vegas, a few AR15s with bump stocks firing into a country music festival beats truck everytime.
2501 2018-10-31 02:05:18 No doubt Ayton might be terrible on D forever. But look no further than the other DeAndre for a toolsy big with awful NCAA stocks + instincts who improved steadily over time.

If you give him even 10% odds of following DAJ defensive arc that gives him scary good upside
2502 2018-10-31 02:04:14 And in a day he’ll go right back to his vile rhetoric.  Remember when he was so moved after the Vegas shooting?  Bump stocks were gone?  Yeah they’re not.....
2503 2018-10-31 02:03:55 ibm is only a 2k holding while altagas is one of the first stocks i ever bought at like 500... just debating sell alta or holding it since im already down.....
2504 2018-10-31 02:02:09 I have stated President Trump is BACK! Strongest Holiday Sales bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As Hurricane Maria death tolls have
2505 2018-10-31 02:02:04 I'll do it now. Stocks are already priced lower than you would otherwise get it. So you still got a sale.
2506 2018-10-31 02:01:28 I don't ever recall saying anything about more downside. First I had concern with your characterization of the current sell-off as being "rapid". Next, I pointed out that easy liquidity, arguably the most important factor for stocks, was not considered in your analysis. Good luck
2507 2018-10-31 01:59:42 Activision-Blizzard shareholders: "half a billion in profit is less than last time by one twentieth of a billion, I'm disappointed" *stocks drop*

I don't want to have to learn 2 more characters to even be allowed to play. I don't want to feel like my first 2 stocks are forfeit at the outset because they're not the character I'm good at.
2514 2018-10-31 01:55:10 Everybody loved KAT bc his stocks were there and Ayton's aren't on top of bad eye test. But KAT is slowwww and Ayton is quick, and I think people underrate how much of a difference that can make on defense in the long haul.
2515 2018-10-31 01:52:57 John, love your work. But aren’t your internals correlated with current mkt performance vs. future mkt performance. Where’s the insight if “deteriorating internals” really just means stocks are declining?
2516 2018-10-31 01:52:10 ...for that is how you out fox a pox box. Now Ed makes good points as he mocks, but as for those clocks, well they ticks and they tocks. Anyone want to box? I could use some new socks. Got tips for some stocks?

2518 2018-10-31 01:51:34 While people are partying for Halloween I'm just...IT'S THE END OF MONTH time to count my workers' salaries, check on accounting & stocks, and type monthly report to my boss. Good luck me |||
2519 2018-10-31 01:50:28 A bear market is the consistent fall of stocks index wide. The 20% rule, isn't even 20% that's just the accepted number, but it's used to CONFIRM. If we go back to bull market before 20%ish it's just a correction, regardless market is trading as a bear market past few wks.
2520 2018-10-31 01:49:16 If you think of it, it is as much a ponzi as crypto or any other asset class is. What they say is, if money stops flowing into BTC, it's price crashes. Isn't that the case for stocks as well?
2521 2018-10-31 01:49:10 I'm on the same path... 2 yrs in trading and can´t be consistently profitable. I have good days and weeks but then it comes the OVER confidence and lose 50% of the month in 1 day. And it is all because of lack of discipline and not following my rules, and being greedy / stubborn.
2522 2018-10-31 01:48:46 Do we know for sure this is the company or a fake account?
2523 2018-10-31 01:48:35 That was as bad as a hillary joke did you write for her as well ? You're both laughing stocks .
2524 2018-10-31 01:48:32 If you’re seeking an entry in volatile stocks and waiting for the MACD to go positive? You may have waited too long already. It often lags.
2525 2018-10-31 01:48:27 Hell no, but if I were holding *any* such stocks at the peak of history's greatest debt binge and stock mania, with bullish sentiment at historic extremes and retail accounts on historic levels of margin, with no clue and no hedges in place, I'd deserve to lose every cent too.
2526 2018-10-31 01:48:19 Stocks just dropped.
2527 2018-10-31 01:48:13 @prayingmedic Hi,  For 10 years or more, my dreams have said to stick to 70% stocks and 30% bonds.   And they still say the came thing.   Our Financial advisor recommends  60/40 for us as we are now in their 80'S,  which I understand.

2543 2018-10-31 01:35:47 Just a reminder that if you liked stocks a month ago, you should love them at these levels. How do the kids say it? HODL!
2544 2018-10-31 01:35:47 You rode the stock market from the previous administration’s efforts and took credit. You then gave temporary fuel to the stocks by giving tax breaks for buybacks and your tariffs increased production in order to avoid the impact. You’re a get rich quick caricature.

2546 2018-10-31 01:33:29 ADRs are American Depository Receipts, sold in London, way for foreigners to buy stocks they can't buy directly in other countries. And they cost more. So Browder cheated by using cutout shell companies to illicitly buy Gazprom shares, which led to the Russian claim against him.
2547 2018-10-31 01:32:56 [see prior] A writer for Barron's, an influential weekly financial newspaper, recently recommended fertilizer stocks because of the world's growing appetite for food.

2562 2018-10-31 01:25:34 Your tweets slowly making me to hold stocks for longer period.. very helpful thanks 
2563 2018-10-31 01:24:45 They are very different. Yes they are a derivative but I’d argue futures are more similar to stocks, at least mechanically. Options have greeks that can make trading them more complicated; futures are buy/sell/spread, that’s it

2578 2018-10-31 01:14:38 It's fake. All my stocks are falling.
2579 2018-10-31 01:13:56 Do not sell on emotion, hold quality stocks and they will eventually go back up
2580 2018-10-31 01:13:29 If stocks go down it will be because of you and your scare tactics, not because of the mid-terms.
2581 2018-10-31 01:13:28 Chubbs and Biscuit run 1-2 in the Box Stocks.  Why couldn’t I have a cool name......
2582 2018-10-31 01:13:17 Bump stocks will be outlawed. They've been used in one crime. One.
You ppl complain about ar15s and bumpstocks and they're rarely used in crime. It's hilarious. You'll never stop bad ppl from getting guns by putting restrictions that bad ppl will ignore.
2583 2018-10-31 01:11:32 If you want your stocks to go up, impeach Trump. It's the only way to get him to stop disgracing us.

2585 2018-10-31 01:09:55 I won't vote. Buying gold stocks is an act of suicide. Get yourself checked out before you have such thoughts.
2586 2018-10-31 01:09:08 Continue to get new entry signals in individual stocks at new highs. All have wide stops, so less capital reqd. Happy to take. Still have 50% cash. Notable bearish consensus on social media. Down moves don’t always have to end the way u want them to (so u recognise they’re over).

2590 2018-10-31 01:07:38 I guess in normal times this is good advice. But when the whole overpriced and artificially (by FED money) pumped up market is coming down - your Gaussian distribution won't matter much. My advice: get out of stocks before the crash, and get in again after ;-)

2595 2018-10-31 01:05:12 Yeah, generally speaking I wouldn’t recommend most ASX listed tech stocks. I don’t think the ASX community really ‘get’ tech yet and we have too many local tech companies using a listing as a last resort when there’s no VC.
2596 2018-10-31 01:05:06 *Stocks your welcome. And I need new socks. So thank you.

2600 2018-10-31 01:02:49 To your good point, if a public company, and stocks take a hit because of taking a political stance then don’t they open themselves up to eventual class action suit?
2601 2018-10-31 01:02:30 The stock market alternates between reflecting the current environment or belief in the future. Either they believe you are bad for stocks or that you will lose the election. Which one do you want to be true?

2609 2018-10-31 00:57:25 I am not drinking the kool aid that this is over, way too much chart overhead, stocks are way off from high's, the average is over 35%. This has not been a 10% correction, this is an ongoing bear market.
2610 2018-10-31 00:56:16 Your example is weak considering the great recession. How do u compare spending then to the debt we're experiencing now, when the country is supposed to be doing so well. It's a Potemkin village. Companies are driving up stocks due to stock buybacks. Downturn is predicted.
2611 2018-10-31 00:55:21 How many of YOUR VOTERS do you think have stocks?

2617 2018-10-31 00:53:35 Here we go into the data heavy part of the week ...we’re in a good news is bad news environment with rates, so strong data that knocks bonds down will do the same to stocks ..we having fun yet ??? Wouldn’t have it any other way!!
2618 2018-10-31 00:53:14 I am glad your parents are in the one percent club, and won't need to depend on social assistance and Medicare to get by. As for stocks in your parents holdings, I would switch quickly to cash funds to avoid getting caught in the second great depression.

2624 2018-10-31 00:45:29 All Hollywood types worry about their brands/ stocks tanking. What I'm curious about is Candace Owens, will she make a statement. Of what went on this is why it all started
2625 2018-10-31 00:44:58 I think he is working with an MJ Newsletter. It’s funny when Fmr Speaker of The House is pumping Cannabis stocks
2626 2018-10-31 00:44:34 It's hard to say. Stocks are going down massively now. This time Democrats might make popcorn and watch.
2627 2018-10-31 00:44:32 The lesser your holding period and more the number of stocks you own, you need to come out with new ideas almost every other month. Difficult to get good ideas with such a frequency. Better to hold fewer companies for long term.

2629 2018-10-31 00:43:43 Naeimi’s bullishness is rare: foreign investors are exiting Chinese stocks at the fastest pace on record -- offloading an average 1.1 billion yuan ($158 million) of A shares a day this month via the Shanghai and Shenzhen trading connects.
2630 2018-10-31 00:43:34 The stocks fell off a cliff, yet Commodities haven’t rallied. Checking on: Copper, Gold, Silver, Coffee, and Oil, and I don’t see that major rally you called for. Perhaps, the “end of cycle” isn’t here yet. It’s 2018, not 2022.
2631 2018-10-31 00:43:25 I am not upset about guns. My own family owns guns. I just feel there should be safeguards out there to prevent irresponsible from owning a gun. Do ppl really need bump stocks?

2635 2018-10-31 00:42:14 Read the article, it talks about what will happen over the next 6 weeks or so with buy backs. Doesn't talk about specific stocks, just overall market buybacks. The SEC rules on buybacks are very gray.
2636 2018-10-31 00:41:34 Asia stocks tentative after a merciless October for global...
2637 2018-10-31 00:40:14 Today I heard talking of a comparison of economic growth under Republican and Democratic control. What I don't hear is the trillions lost in Iraq or Afghanistan. Of course that was great for military arms manufacturing, their stocks probably did very well.
2638 2018-10-31 00:40:13 The majority of Americans don’t own stocks in ways that the market drastically effects them. Your rich socialists do though. Oh and the market won’t collapse.
2639 2018-10-31 00:39:51 Haha....He's so full of crap. When stocks are up, he takes credit. But when they go down, it's Democrats or others fault.
2640 2018-10-31 00:39:13 Nope. That’s what I’m counting on. Not planning on selling ... just so frustrating when stocks move up enough you honestly think there’s enough cushion that even if a steep sell off happens you’ll still be green... but no! $nvidia $celgene $gilead $Achaogen etc. 
2641 2018-10-31 00:39:10 That’s not what I’m seeing and hearing in the stock market, oh ya it’s not your fault it’s them pesky Democrats, them bastards their everywhere. I think after the tax cuts and companies buying back their stocks instead of increasing wages their exercising their options, good job

2646 2018-10-31 00:29:17 Thank you so much Mr. Burkman for making the Republican Party look like laughing stocks, and your timing was impeccable. Exactly one week before midterms. How clever! You knew this would inflict maximum damage. And here all this time we thought you supported the Republicans.
2647 2018-10-31 00:28:25 There are many reasons to be bullish stocks. Will be adding longs as we approach a prop buy signal which will negates the Jan Sell signal. Will be posting blog posts on this.

2649 2018-10-31 00:26:34 What would America look like if instead of 10% of the wealthiest few having 84% of all stocks they had 10% and the bottom 90% economically had 90% of all shares or something close to that?
2650 2018-10-31 00:26:06 So few stocks look good that way too many chat rooms/ traders are all looking at the same few stocks.  When they don’t work immediately the exit is harsh. Need institutions buying them.  Institutions are not going to chase in this environment.
2651 2018-10-31 00:23:54 If I knew, I’d mortgage the house and margin it up.  Since I dont, I set my stops and selling as my stocks hit those stops to raise cash.
2652 2018-10-31 00:21:27 Get this straight. 
This is NOT a strong economy!
Not for all or even most of us
84% of all stocks are held by the top 10% wealthiest few
Those punching time clocks face higher housing, healthcare & college costs while not seeing raises despite a higher stock market!

2655 2018-10-31 00:19:22 Mark, I think I got it. They are doing a pump and dump. The execs have bought a bunch of their own stocks, pushing the value high, selling off, then drop this, crashes the stock, they short just before and then buy more stock to pump it up again.
2656 2018-10-31 00:18:44 My stocks went steadily up under President Obama. Now they’ve dropped about $500/share and dropping. I don’t have many, but I like to see them increase in value. I don’t know how you’re blaming this on the Democrats, when I know you’ll take credit if they go back up.
2657 2018-10-31 00:18:01 Fun fact: The richest 10% of households accounted for 81% of the total value of stocks. Therefore, this only proves that the rich are getting richer & ur Presidency is not doing much for the rest of us 90%-ers.
2658 2018-10-31 00:17:51 I hope Republicans know that they are the laughing stocks of the world!

2664 2018-10-31 00:16:15 $GE debacle is a great example of why advisors should avoid stock picking. “Don’t worry I only buy quality large cap high dividend yielding stocks”. Yea ok..
2665 2018-10-31 00:16:13 Actually the stocks will go up
2666 2018-10-31 00:16:05 The thing that amazes me is that $TSLAQ has taught me a ton. So why wouldn't Charlie learn from people willing to teach? I know the fraud angle, DOJ, FBI side as it relates to $TSLA but you all know the stocks & bonds side and have been kind to teach those willing to learn.
2667 2018-10-31 00:14:38 I have no stocks, but I will nevertheless take your advice and vote Democratic.
2668 2018-10-31 00:14:21 Stocks are already going down and will go down more once Trump's tariffs and other policy's go into place.  They will really go down once we reach a point where money is scarce because of the US debt.

2672 2018-10-31 00:12:06 The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders!
2673 2018-10-31 00:11:37 Instead, value investors take advantage of volatility; sensibly averaging down entry prices to attractive stocks and buying high quality businesses at a discount when others are fearful.
2674 2018-10-31 00:10:05 20% of the total portfolio, 33% of stocks. Nothing magical about those numbers though. I'd say anywhere from 20% to 50% of stocks is reasonable.
2675 2018-10-31 00:10:01 Overpriced as fuck ang snacks ss victoria dept store. What the fuck. 50% of the original price man dayon ang mark-up? What the fuck. Okay ra mo? I can't even think of a proper reason why you should price that high when your stocks are nearing to expiration. Again, what the fuck.
2676 2018-10-31 00:09:17 I see none of our stocks mentioned here, oh wise Jedi master.
2677 2018-10-31 00:08:56 US stocks are down based on concerns that the Democrats may win in the midterm elections,  but Trump will continue to rise after winning
2678 2018-10-31 00:08:23 08/09 I cleaned up buying boats/cars/houses/stocks/all assets I was interested in for 1/3rd value. Dad taught me to save during good times. Spend during worst of times. This simple principle can make young people rich but they seem genetically geared to be sheep/idiots/punished
2679 2018-10-31 00:05:37 Yeah, classic type of trap that I regularly fall into which is a great reason to try not to promote my stocks.
2680 2018-10-31 00:05:29 These are the 1 stocks in finance sector that yesterday marked all-time highs:

2681 2018-10-31 00:04:52 U.S. stocks close higher, as President @realDonaldTrump signaled that U.S.  is ready to reach a deal to ease trade tensions with China.- DOW JONES (24 874,64) 1.77% +431,72 - NASDAQ  (7 161,65) 1.58% +111,36 - S&P 500 (2 682,63)1.57% +41,38
2682 2018-10-31 00:04:46 Socialist isn't a bad name bc it means that everybody gets a piece of the pie not from anyone else's pocket but from Co ownership similar to stocks & bonds everybody has ownership
2683 2018-10-31 00:04:39 @LouDobbs we have given back 1/2 of the Trump Bump. Obama had 96 months of average 2%/month gains in S&P Trump inherited low inflation  and low interest rates.  Fed is not driving rates it's treasuries & record borrowing u moron. #stocks
2684 2018-10-31 00:04:23 Stocks are giving up their anticipatory gains as the reality of your tariffs bite into the bottom line.
2685 2018-10-31 00:02:15 Yet we ban certain drugs that are highly lethal, especially when not administered responsibility by a doctor. I think it's reasonable to have restrictions on deadly things. I.e. Limit high capacity magazines, bump stocks.
2686 2018-10-31 00:02:15 Pot stocks trade goods, services, and commodities for which there is potentially insatiable demand. Dot coms and crypto trade in intangible ideas that may or may not catch on. Not a bubble, but a temporarily overvalued sector that has now corrected and will resume trend up.
2687 2018-10-31 00:01:43 That's it exactly. Stocks went up when you took office.
2688 2018-10-31 00:00:13 Major U.S. #stock indexes jumped more than 1 percent on Tuesday, helped by strong gains for chip and transport stocks as investors took advantage of cheaper prices following a steep recent pullback for #shares .
