2 2018-03-01 23:58:01 Tariffs on steel anounced: steel company stocks rise; at exactly same time stocks in every company that uses steel (car companies, manufacturing, etc.) take a nose dive. Sigh..... 
3 2018-03-01 23:57:39 God forbid they have access to gas passing butt stocks.
4 2018-03-01 23:57:33 Trump is a bitchhhhh throwing out terms like “trade wars” making my stocks drop $200  why?
5 2018-03-01 23:57:29 With " #tradewar" talk in the air, stocks closed sharply lower on Wall Street.
6 2018-03-01 23:57:18 funny how selloffs in anything are always billed as "irrational" and yet stocks going to infinity and retail investors logging triple-digit returns shorting vol. from their home office was always billed as "completely justified by growth and earnings"
7 2018-03-01 23:56:58 Some penny stocks like energy, products and mining sectors will go up as restrictions are lifted from deregulation, lower taxes, and better trade goes into effect. Just hedge your bets and you’ll be safe. Coal, steel, and American made products have been down but now things up.
8 2018-03-01 23:56:15 Strong consumer confidence!! What a joke!!!!! Who is conducting the survey? Please!! Economy is not any better and it's all "propped up" with fake money (stocks)! No REAL goods are being sold. Just matter of time -next "recession" aka...stk mkt fall.

9 2018-03-01 23:55:56 Add a bump stock that reduces the recoil time and you have a virtually automatic weapon. Bump stocks are all over the internet.

18 2018-03-01 23:52:13 My debt is just my mortgage. My work and an independent investment is doing well. Saving for a rainy day makes sense to me. I am using ETrade with just $500. I buy a bunch of good penny stocks and a couple of good dividends stocks. No hurry no rush just plan to use what’s in.

39 2018-03-01 23:51:20 Research a topic before blanket comments, it is not a dump idea to the 1300 staff from 225 school districts who have came to #FASTERSavesLives training
40 2018-03-01 23:51:11 Is this penny stocks? 
41 2018-03-01 23:50:55 Why would market cap alone be a determinant of whether a company is cheap or expensive?  That makes zero sense.   It’s probably one of the cheapest pharma stocks in the world?
42 2018-03-01 23:49:47 European stocks fell on Thursday amid a batch of lacklustre corporate earnings reports.
43 2018-03-01 23:49:13 2. Again, reversed an unconstitutional EO and has asked Congress to put a law on his desk that bans bump stocks, blocks gun ownership by mentally ill and expands background checks. Now congress must do their job.
44 2018-03-01 23:48:37 Should of gave you some Casey stocks... U need my fuel tank more than me
45 2018-03-01 23:48:20 Absolutely! Raising the minimum age to 21 is only a direct breach of our constitutional rights. Same with stopping the sale of bump stocks. Besides, bump stocks are easy to make. What good will ending the sales do? @realDonaldTrump is only catering to the leftists here. Not cool.

47 2018-03-01 23:47:26 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President: Good job w the steel and aluminum tariffs. Stocks went into negative territory 4 the year following ur comments re the same, and lots of folks r blaming u.  Please tell them, Mr. President, that u aren't responsible for what happens with stocks.
48 2018-03-01 23:46:54 @DICKS decided to stop selling “assault style weapons.” Lol I forgot they were even still in business. Guess they were desperate for some publicity. Time to sell your stocks everyone, Dicks sporting goods will be shutting their doors permanently pretty soon.
49 2018-03-01 23:46:45 Stocks day. Why do i always get a shift on fridays?! So unfair.
50 2018-03-01 23:46:33 so you dont have evidence lol youre just making wild claims...this is between you and me not her. and the nasdaq can absolutely be an info source...it shows the success of certain companies. plus gun manu. stocks havent crashed, there down cuz its not the season
51 2018-03-01 23:46:30 U.S. stocks falls and treasuries rise as markets fear a trade war between steel producers in asia/Europe vs U.S.
52 2018-03-01 23:46:06 US stocks fell on Thursday as potential tariffs on steel and aluminium being touted by president Donald Trump sparked fears of a trade war with China that could hurt American companies and consumers.

55 2018-03-01 23:45:42 Ask Rep. Thomas Massey of Kentucky: Where in the 2nd amendment does it say "Ye shall keep bump stocks and assault rifles." Could it be that the Founders were living in a different world than today?
56 2018-03-01 23:45:38 #bbcqt farage bringing up fishing as usual as if the oceans aren't empty. Centuries of fishermen acting like hunters instead they should have been acting like farmers has left fish stocks dwindling.
57 2018-03-01 23:45:01 Another session we cashed in on today.  I'll be posting some research I did on trading economic news later today.

58 2018-03-01 23:44:57 #bbcqt Farage - let's get our fish back. So we can overfish again and kill off all our stocks as nearly happened before? And as for Michelle wanting schools to train for employers. No, schools are for education.
59 2018-03-01 23:44:52 It's a big increase when world wheat stocks are still so high. Mind you plenty of spec and fund traders looking to work the market. @ten_tigers

62 2018-03-01 23:43:22 How many penny stocks do you know that are not only making revenues -- but PROFITS?  And growing value for shareholders.  Most weed stocks are a long way from profitability...
63 2018-03-01 23:43:15 A green close for Canadian Marijuana Index, U.S. Marijuana Index, North American Marijuana Index. Also 30 of the 37 pot stocks on my watchlist closed green. Could this be the start to the biggest market recovery of the year? Time will tell
64 2018-03-01 23:43:14 Gun sales shot up, way up, when Obama became potus. & whenever a consumer thinks they will have limited access to a product, sales get a bump.
Gun stocks are down, communities are setting local gun laws, financial institutions & consumers are divesting themselves from gun stocks
65 2018-03-01 23:41:53 So you're telling me you pulled a JV3 with Ganon, and took two stocks while only giving 60%.... With Ganon.
66 2018-03-01 23:41:47 @KellyannePolls ...talk to your boss. He ran on PROTECTING our #2A rights. Tell him no assualt weapon ban. He’s being set up by the #Dems and they won’t stop at assualt weapons. Extended background checks, bump stocks and mental health make sense. That’s it!
67 2018-03-01 23:41:39 President Trump just put Tariff's on CHINA for Steel and Aluminum products knowing it would hit the Stocks.#'s. ! He's sick of China not allowing USA products in and the few that are have Tariff's .They dump cheap crap in USA ! Now let's negotiate he says! NRA is solid ! #MAGA
68 2018-03-01 23:40:32 Donald Trump is planning to write an executive order banning bump stocks that's not good what happened to standing up for gunrights
69 2018-03-01 23:40:01 If you own stocks the buy backs are benefiting you.
70 2018-03-01 23:39:49 Trump's boyfriend showing off their Big missiles notice how Trump does fucking nothing thing except send stock market crashing over his new Steele trade wars any other POTUS would have responded to Putin in such a way that it would have sent stocks soring Not Trump
71 2018-03-01 23:39:28 Trump is all about quick fixes, or keeping the status quo because of money or votes. I doubt at all that he’s serious about addressing gun violence and mental health care, hence his quick action on bump stocks. Bump stocks aren’t the real problem.
72 2018-03-01 23:38:25 @potus comprehensive background checks, no bump stocks, losing Hope, now high beer prices, he touches #nascar, he’s done!
73 2018-03-01 23:38:16 Bitcoin/cryptos and gold/gold stocks seems to have bottomed. $USD looks it has completed it oversold bounce. Stocks to bottom next week sometime and then everything can rally again.
74 2018-03-01 23:38:02 Okay sanctions cause the stock market to drop and then the president's Friends by the stocks cheap and then the prices go up and they make money is that how it works
75 2018-03-01 23:37:16 Stocks fell 1.6% today. @NBCNightlyNews called this, “plummeting.” How do you feel about this choice of words?

78 2018-03-01 23:36:14 Stocks DOWN!
79 2018-03-01 23:36:05 That would be correct but in this case I am comparing different kinds of stocks. Utility stocks don't have potential to grow higher even if they retain their earnings.
80 2018-03-01 23:35:02 If TLT breaks the major range floor just below......Stocks will get upset.
81 2018-03-01 23:33:12 yea banning bump stocks is useless like u said u can replicate so u either ban rifles, which isnt likely and not plausible to buyback a majority, or you put waiting times which again is not solving the issue just prolonging a potential threat
82 2018-03-01 23:33:08 For gods twat look at the stocks the beginning of this year

84 2018-03-01 23:32:00 Getting more emails from brokers to buy stocks as I think too late to game for for awhile as I look elsewhere to make  money as not realestate either!
85 2018-03-01 23:31:11 Markets are thin.  If carrying a lot of exposure,  keep that in mind.  Bids are paper thin in many stocks.  (offers, too)
86 2018-03-01 23:30:56 Dean, what bills are you introducing to avoid another massacre like the Route 91 Harvest Festival where some 58 people were killed with automatic rifles equipped with bump stocks so it can maximize the killing capacity? You doing anything on that or for the families of the slain?

90 2018-03-01 23:29:49 Bank stocks are set to tumble. Sell!!
91 2018-03-01 23:29:34 Guns: Automatic/machine guns are illegal; bump stocks make a semi-automatic automatic; but they won't legislate against them!? Sense? Reason? Logic? Surreal! Single lens reflexive reflects how?

93 2018-03-01 23:29:27 Agnar, it was a bump stock, or stocks, that gave the Las Vegas shooter the ability to fire at the high rate he did. He was not merely pulling the trigger as fast as he could. Please.
94 2018-03-01 23:29:25 Still like some commodities.  Some materials,  Energy, conservative health care,  uranium, Ag stocks.
95 2018-03-01 23:29:05 Here’s a start...
Stop taking @NRA $
Ban civilian possession of assault rifles / bump stocks and offer a buy back program with the “wall” money. 
Reinstate the law preventing people with mental health issues from owning guns. 
Make straw sales of firearms a federal offense.
96 2018-03-01 23:28:38 Just watched the Video i did on Steve shives, Holy Shit people are going to be pissed off.
With any luck PopCorn stocks will go up.
97 2018-03-01 23:28:31 Thanks to hunters buddy. Stocks not guaranteed, cars break down and gas is expensive, how you gonna get a house with $500? But you can kill a deer and get a good bit of meat. Think a little buddy
98 2018-03-01 23:28:30 You are always direct and honest is your assessments!  That is why so many of us follow you Mr. Payne...though the good times and up and downs of stocks.  Thanks!
99 2018-03-01 23:28:08 Sell her blonde stocks
100 2018-03-01 23:27:03 Agreed. Accelerated. But didn’t cause the selloff. They clicked off stop losses. buying stocks at 26k plus. (Under some tv recommendation s)To far above trend line on low volume. That was foolish. Fat cats started it and sit back. IMO starting shorting at 25800 on Dow.
101 2018-03-01 23:26:20 ...you can tell those that dumped stocks are globalists...hehe
102 2018-03-01 23:25:08 Or you could take that $500 and invest in something else like a car, house, stocks, etc. And last time I checked, and admittedly I could be wrong, deer are not a population threat.
103 2018-03-01 23:24:52 Oh good god, that’s going to be a very long list! Haha! We should buy stocks in the paper industry! 
104 2018-03-01 23:24:31 @jimcramer if I cried all day long my eyes would still not be as red as my stocks #opkstock what is going on? @Ford come on guys a little help here bummer day red portfolio! 
105 2018-03-01 23:24:28 Ban opioids, just like you are stupidly trying with bump stocks!
106 2018-03-01 23:23:39 #madtweets With the US finally fighting back in the ongoing trade war waged by China ON US, and likely war with North Korea coming, think it’s a good time to buy defense stocks?
107 2018-03-01 23:23:04 If you're referring to quantitative easing, pensioners who shifted from bonds to stocks made a lot of money...

112 2018-03-01 23:20:46 As I replied earlier...bump stocks or a handful of parts legally available would allow me to convert an AR15 to full automatic. I was a weapons specialist and armor. Minimal gunsmithing will allow conversion to select semi or full auto mode.
113 2018-03-01 23:20:37 Actually instead of just
"Ban bump stocks"
Make illegal
ANY TRIGGER type modifications
Designed to circumvent 
The auto fire ban
Or any mod's used to even
EMULATE AUTO FIRE.
114 2018-03-01 23:20:31 I heard this AM global steel stocks took a dive , but USA steel stocks were soaring !!
115 2018-03-01 23:20:10 Weed stocks went up. So to the Moon ! 
116 2018-03-01 23:19:53 Notice that stocks plunged as soon as Trump stated that... I’m sure his friends knew about it before he stated it too.

118 2018-03-01 23:18:48 Donald , said lets make America great again, he has slowly secured oil reserves fracking! like a man processed? and now tariffs on imports what is the world to do. Nothing pay up !!  #thr #88e popular #AIM stocks will be happy dyor gl
119 2018-03-01 23:18:43 I agree that bump stocks should be illegal. As long as it stays semi-auto I’m fine.
120 2018-03-01 23:18:41 Can they make us turn bump stocks in if they ban them like New Jersey and face jail time and fines if we don’t
121 2018-03-01 23:17:39 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
122 2018-03-01 23:17:34 Stocks in private jails could see a rise in price.
123 2018-03-01 23:17:34 Who did bump stocks kill?
Are pressure cookers and box cutters next on the ban list?
How about rope since KKK libsexuals used them to lynch all of them folks?
124 2018-03-01 23:17:20 @NRA if they ban bump stocks can they make us give them up like New Jersey I don’t want to waste my money and buy one only to be told I must turn in or go to jail and pay fines

126 2018-03-01 23:17:13 This was a gun show you posted. not the entire sales results since the shooting till now. Stocks have gone down. NRA needs to spark the fear again.
127 2018-03-01 23:17:05 Did Donald Trump & family purchase stock options to hugely profit off of the announcement & the predictable stocks selloff?
128 2018-03-01 23:16:48 Ivanka... everything she touches... the FDA lady with tobacco stocks... you missed quite a few
129 2018-03-01 23:16:43 True, but I'm more of a Buffett-type investor; dividend paying, less than $35/share, established stocks. Less volatility, some monthly div. payers, and a newsletter portfolio up 35% even after the last correction.
130 2018-03-01 23:16:32 Fear Of Missing Out
131 2018-03-01 23:16:23 Banning bump stocks, grabbing guns first and asking questions later, imposing tariffs on steal and aluminum? It is Trumps crumbling relationship with the GOP that will get him impeached.
132 2018-03-01 23:15:14 I think molasses used to be a way bigger deal than it is now. Someone shorted molasses stocks in the 50s and they’re a millionaire now.
133 2018-03-01 23:15:10 GUN stocks are down, thank God. Thanks to our new young citizens who are stepping up to power, I thank you.Trumps B$ is starting 2 show,his tariff's on steel & aluminum are not going 2 hurt China as reported by our own MSM. Canada is to be hit hardest. China is 11th on the list,
134 2018-03-01 23:15:07 That’s where it goes overboard as well as silencers and detachable stocks. An AR has a painless death but people don’t like it so. #gunsense
135 2018-03-01 23:15:00 DAX Futures have closed beneath the previous day's low for 3 days in a row. The run last extended to 4 days on 4 November 2016, 335 trading days ago. DAX ended Thursday at the lowest closing level since 30 August 2017, 126 trading days earlier #stocks
136 2018-03-01 23:14:56 See what stocks do if 85% Of trucking industry shuts down!  Want something of substance that affects the entire nation to report on?..talk with @OOIDA #meetREALtruckers #eldorme
137 2018-03-01 23:14:56 Supers and late model stocks I think!
138 2018-03-01 23:14:51 Maybe he is saying execute the pharmaceutical corporations that are drug pushing Opioid. No he owns their stocks. Lol
139 2018-03-01 23:14:50 Trump suggesting using an EO to ban bump stocks. He's really pissing off the NRA. I may disagree with almost anything he says's but he's too rich to be bought out by the NRA.
140 2018-03-01 23:14:38 I’ve been counting stocks with the head chef, and we’ve been just talking like the count from sesame street.
141 2018-03-01 23:14:04 @seanhannity Talk about continued high food prices and electric rates. and everything else that hasn't dropped in price. The tax bill has done nothing for that. Companies are buying back their own stocks just as they do every time they're given a tax break
142 2018-03-01 23:13:38 I know about Walmart but they raised their age to 21 dick's sold them here in FL. Gun stocks are down, we saw a short-term bump in  gun stocks today which happens when ppl think they may not be able to buy a product anymore. 
A big consumer gun stock divestment is on the horizon.
143 2018-03-01 23:13:37 You are referencing the bump stocks that were approved for sale during the Obama administration. 

Those bump stocks ?
144 2018-03-01 23:13:07 When an announcement from the president causes certain stocks to plumet ( temperarily) good chance it's planned and certain entities scoop up lowered value stocks. Plan is in place to be sure the stock goes back up. Somebody wins big. Manipulation
145 2018-03-01 23:12:49 Yeah, um, nothing though it seems like my insurance premiums are going up and my stocks are tanking. Thanks a lot a-hole.
146 2018-03-01 23:12:19 Least I haven’t lost this much! 

Warren Buffett’s wealth dropped $3.74 billion since Monday as U.S. stocks tumbled for a third straight day
147 2018-03-01 23:11:33 I favour both, as equally as I can, hence they are both tier'1 stocks.
148 2018-03-01 23:10:25 Likelihood of big tech like (google, Facebook) being treated like a public utility and the effects on their stocks?
149 2018-03-01 23:10:25 Thanks for taking the time to share your feedback. We are sorry for the frustrations caused with the out of stocks and we will address this with management.
150 2018-03-01 23:10:19 Purchase  defense stocks if Bolton is named National Security Advisor. Smart choices are #Raytheon #Oshkosh #LockheedMartin & #HuntingtonIngalls to name a few #ThursdayThoughts

152 2018-03-01 23:09:20 Day Two of the Great Scottish Snow-in. Food stocks are dwindling fast. Families forced to stay indoors now using Lego bricks as rudimentory currency. Pets forced to eat what's down the back of the sofa. No end in sight.
153 2018-03-01 23:09:15 My stocks are down again today. #thanksTrump
154 2018-03-01 23:09:13 @cnn I am wondering if Trump is manipulating the market for profit.  Does he gain from purchasing and selling stocks that he has had a direct influence on? Does his friends and family?  #trumpsucks
155 2018-03-01 23:07:59 I need to buy some pre-ban Bump Stocks, they are about to increase in value 200 fold
156 2018-03-01 23:07:43 Stocks will recover. Trump provided fertile ground for steel companies to succeed in the U.S. 

Once we start getting the steel mills going, we'll be better than ever.
157 2018-03-01 23:07:29 US President Trump makes surprise announcement on import tariffs. US stocks plunge but USD falls from highs also. AUD holds 77 cents #ausbiz
158 2018-03-01 23:07:23 LMAO—Stocks Don’t Bounce off “Lagging “ Moving Averages!!      #AmatureTalk
159 2018-03-01 23:07:12 #bbcqt Fishing was and is decimated by being in the EU, well if fishermen get their way and their allowed to fish and take 100% of catch from our waters,then in 5 years they’ll have no fish left to fish,the whole reason the quotas are in place is to allow fish stocks to grow.
160 2018-03-01 23:07:10 Bump stocks are not proven to be used in Las Vegas. So no one will be safer after the ban. You do realize criminals have fully automatic machine guns and they don’t give a shit about your ban.
161 2018-03-01 23:07:02 @realDonaldTrump The close: $300-billion in US market cap wiped out as stocks plunge on Trump steel tariffs #NUTCASESOUTTHERE $GROWUP
162 2018-03-01 23:06:55 What's this demonization of bump stocks anyway?  There's only 1 instance of them being used nefariously.  Do we ban everything that's been misused even once?
163 2018-03-01 23:05:29 U do realize he was kind of right to avoid the early stage tech boom because it went bust if you can recall. You said he avoids tech stocks which is untrue because he owns A LOT of Apple shares, the 2nd biggest in Berkshire's entire portfolio behind Wells Fargo
164 2018-03-01 23:05:28 well thats going to bother him, especially as he's getting pummelled in stocks
Arsenal is worth a lot less now after GBP moved post brexit
165 2018-03-01 23:05:24 With all these electric cars coming on line in the early 2020s, I think shorting oil and oil stocks is setting up to be the easiest trade in a long

169 2018-03-01 23:03:50 Traders need to remember, that Many Large Institutional Players-Postponed any Profit taking—Until this year’s Tax Cuts. This is just Normal-Prudent Profit Taking. Stocks Will Continue to be Bought—Until Rates-are Much Higher! IMHO
170 2018-03-01 23:03:44 Hunters don’t use assault rifles and bump stocks...stop changing the subject.
171 2018-03-01 23:02:57 This is too beautiful! Now I know why this book sold out in our stocks before World Book Day! Obviously inspired both of you. Reading my secret stashed copy tomorrow!
172 2018-03-01 23:02:55 Yep, feeling the Vitamin D stocks are getting low.
173 2018-03-01 23:02:10 Stocks have been soaring for five years and you call a one-day tiny dip a “new low”???
174 2018-03-01 23:02:09 Stop and think for a minute. Bump stocks, assault rifles, silencers sold over the counter, under 21 can buy guns, 17 round pistol clips. This is not Dodge City. This is America. Yes the right to bare arms. Yes the right to protect yourself and others.
175 2018-03-01 23:02:07 You might be interested in Salem streets stocks, considering that’s what you just described
176 2018-03-01 23:02:00 1) Background checks are already universal.  2) “Assault weapons” cannot be owned by civilians. 3) Obama had the opportunity to ban bump stocks. He didn’t. 4) Criminals give 0 shits about age requirement. 5) Pull your head out of your ass and get informed on the subject.
177 2018-03-01 23:01:39 2 Tariff Trump sends Stocks tumbling?
178 2018-03-01 23:01:20 Would have banned bump stocks. He was rich enough for the tax stamp to buy pre-ban automatic weapons though. Suppressors too. He didn't because it was extremely easy not to.

It's about making it harder for them to commit murder, not easier.
179 2018-03-01 23:01:01 Market is making me nervous , seems to be controlled by a few at the top and day traders. I’m in it for long buying value stocks so be reason for this . Especially based on previous 8 years , this should be a two to three year run , little pissed.
180 2018-03-01 23:00:39 I'm quite familiar with handguns & rifles of all sorts, and their range, stopping power etc.  In a school/church, handguns can be just as deadly.  Also, any semi-auto, including handguns, can be bump fired *without* bump stocks or other similar accessories. YouTube will show you.
181 2018-03-01 22:59:41 OGs using patience and experience in this consolidating market. #trading #stocks #tradingpsychology #Crypto
182 2018-03-01 22:58:32 @realDonaldTrump If you're a dictator, then by all means go after bump stocks, which have nothing to do w/Parkland. If you were elected to be President, then with all due respect, stay in your lane. PS. grab guns first THEN due process not how it works in Constitutional Republic.
183 2018-03-01 22:58:31 And then my stocks took a nose dive after he did that! May @realDonaldTrump ROT IN HELL!!
184 2018-03-01 22:58:29 I've gone through stores stocks....it's so rare

189 2018-03-01 22:56:20 The largest re-investments that tax cuts have provided is billions of dollars for companies to buy back stocks so their executives get HUGE payouts. Walmart for example, only invest 2% of the tax cut savings back to workers so far. The rest went to executives and shareholders.

192 2018-03-01 22:55:36 You are proposing a START to #CommonSenseGunLaws. Here's some additional things that would aid in #GunViolencePrevention:
Ban assault-style firearms. 
Raise the minimum age to purchase firearms to 21. 
Ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks. 
C'mon! Do it for ALL of us!
193 2018-03-01 22:55:32 @GuyAdami I'm a fan, Guy. Among all the folks on FM, I think & trade most like you do. Been on CLF and TGT for years & followed you into MU last Oct. All great trading stocks. Great work, Guy. Giddy-yap! Big fan of Karen F too.

196 2018-03-01 22:55:08 The problem is with the AR-15 is two-fold: 1. No legitimate use other than as an offense weapon of war. 2. the patent has expired.  So its effectively open source which leads to bump stocks.

200 2018-03-01 22:53:49 The Dow finished Thursday 413 points below Wednesday's low. It was the 2nd day in a row that the Dow had closed beneath the previous day's low. The run last extended to 3 days on 30 December 2016, 293 trading days ago #stocks
201 2018-03-01 22:53:36 @icarusam yes including all therapeutic & lifesaving RX stocks are subject to trade war.
202 2018-03-01 22:53:04 That's a horrible idea, I'm all for banning assault style weapons and bump stocks but this limits the ability of low income people to protect their homes and families
203 2018-03-01 22:52:42 Watsons, please pakiramihan po ang stocks ng Mediheal. Love yourself, love myself. PEACE
204 2018-03-01 22:52:35 The lack of creativity in gun regulations, prohibition of detachable stocks and magazines over 30+1 rounds flash suppressors and silencers is a start.
205 2018-03-01 22:52:32 16 steel companies up today because of Trump protectionist tariff announces today to the tunes of $1. The entire rest of the S & P 500 stocks down $400
206 2018-03-01 22:52:13 BREAKING:

1. Mueller about to hand down indictments on hacking & leaking hacked material during 2016 campaign. 

2. McMaster about to bail. Pushed out by Tillerson & Mad Dog. 

3. Stocks tank after Trump announces tariffs. 

4. I’m popping corn & settling in for a juicy night.
207 2018-03-01 22:51:42 What happened to banning bump stocks or raising the age to buy a gun?  Who’s afraid of the NRA now?
208 2018-03-01 22:51:24 I agree we need to act... but act with a solid plan... not out of anger and fear... How many different methods have been thrown in the "Fix" path (1) Bumb stocks (2) Age (3) Laws (4) regulations (5) Mental Health (6) Outlaw AR-15 (7) 3rd party gun sales (8) Kids Marching
209 2018-03-01 22:50:52 I continue to buy the Retail stocks here. Good earnings from DDS M GPS. under owned sector
210 2018-03-01 22:49:55 Yes they travelled into the future and saw bump stocks in the horizon and thought we need something now that will protect the small penisis of the future.
211 2018-03-01 22:49:51 We have no idea what stocks he has shorted. He may we’ll be cashing in.
212 2018-03-01 22:49:49 great stuff, ty. have you analyzed the top 5-10 stocks individually? don't trust what ETFs have done to mkts...seems 10 stocks have accounted for far too much success and many are parabolic...BA as ex in Dow
213 2018-03-01 22:49:44 You sure Trump doesn't look at tariffs through the eyes of a crafty, greedy, rich SOB who can buy up stock options and then announce policy that tanks those stocks at will?
214 2018-03-01 22:49:05 FOX perhaps you should discuss the record breaking scandals set in February, month that stocks PLUNGED!  How many more are leaving like rats on a sinking ship.  Can you say McMasters.
215 2018-03-01 22:48:39 I just got this notification on my phone: "Warren Buffett has lost $3.7 billion this week after U.S. stocks tumbled for a 3rd straight day." I doubt he sold anything. Therefore, he didn't lose. Buffett is widely known for the quote "Our favorite holding period is forever".
216 2018-03-01 22:48:33 Time for an analyst recommendation pushing 'long gun stocks/short beer stocks' as trade of the year

219 2018-03-01 22:47:14 Outlawing bump stocks, closing gun show loopholes, controlling the sale of assault weapons would be a good idea too, for someone who is not a tool for the @NRA #NRABloodMoney
220 2018-03-01 22:47:08 Most crypto = penny stocks.  Same thing.
221 2018-03-01 22:46:48 Banning bump stocks is classic feel good legislation anyway. Banning them is stupid. Making sure neither branch overreaches is a good thing though, so good on this rep.
222 2018-03-01 22:45:58 WI repealed cooling off period as irrelevant. But WHAT A DAY IN ILLINOIS! @MomsDemand ALL PASSED! 72-hour cooling off period, Ban on bump stocks, 21 to own assault weapons. Gun Dealership Licensing - On to GOVERNER! Lethal Order of Protection passed by Senate.
223 2018-03-01 22:45:53 FISA courts, DACA, North K, Unmasking of US citizens, bump stocks, school shootings,  ETC, Good God Obama left a mess in the US and you blame Trump!

227 2018-03-01 22:44:02 Nothing to see here. A couple of Trumptard redneck militia freaks with their ARs, bump stocks, 30-round mags, and laser sights could take this flying beer can. NOT!!!
228 2018-03-01 22:44:00 And with that, stocks dropped....
229 2018-03-01 22:43:37 Talking about bump stocks. Or you can put your thumb in the belt loop of your pants, hold the trigger, and it works the same. Using An AR style of gun of course.
230 2018-03-01 22:43:37 I have a solution that will stop gun violence.... NOT lip service... my method will work... ALL the idea's taking place now (Bump stocks, March, Rally's, BG checks, age, regulations, laws) WILL NEVER WORK... EVER! CRIMINALS DON'T CARE ABOUT SOME LAW.... I need your support!
231 2018-03-01 22:43:28 See which stocks are posting big moves after the bell Thursday.
232 2018-03-01 22:43:13 Let them fall .... keeps them from being artificially high...  And Stocks fell in what companies.. The ones that import steel. Good... Buy American anyway...
233 2018-03-01 22:42:49 Right.  And they inflict a similar amount of death very quickly (even if not as quick as a full auto).  But with bump stocks, it becomes dangerous.

Eliminating semi and fully auto weapons doesn’t prevent someone from defending themselves, nor does it infringe on the second amndt
234 2018-03-01 22:42:14 "I stack bread, get money bitch!" Wheres your passive income, financial education, stocks, bonds, etc. tho?!?

240 2018-03-01 22:40:46 The rates hikes are coming until the stock market tanks enough. Need a proper bear market in stocks.
241 2018-03-01 22:40:25 Soaring budget & trade deficits, rising interest rates, higher inflation, a falling dollar, protectionist tariffs, looming trade war, and a slowing economy all portend lower corporate earnings and a bear market in stocks. Let's see how much longer Powell can pretend all is well.
242 2018-03-01 22:40:03 You look at the stocks much???
243 2018-03-01 22:39:38 Surprise, I do agree with you that bump stocks. But does your bill included others things that we do not agree with? I hope only bump stocks is what is presented.
244 2018-03-01 22:39:30 basic regulations, that address the biggest problems (detachable stocks, silencers, extended foregrips abd flash suppressors basically people carrying firearms outside their homes or business leading to instant acts of....deaths. #Gunsensemustmakesense #GunControl
245 2018-03-01 22:39:26 "Well-regulated militia" - Does that mean anything to you? What is the purpose of civilians owning military-style weapons, high-capacity magazines, or bump stocks? Why are Republicans incapable of simple logic?
246 2018-03-01 22:39:24 Tom price airline, Carson no bid contract, Wilbur Ross holdings, Tom price healthcare stocks
247 2018-03-01 22:39:20 Outlawing bump stocks is a solid move. But you will not keep AR15's out of the hands not entitled as long as you can buy unregistered lower recievers and the parts online to completely build a AR15. Its simply a loop hole that gets one over on the ATF.
248 2018-03-01 22:39:20 If you have a public or private pension, IRA or 401k, or receive money from a foundation/ charity....you own stocks. Most of America either directly or indirectly owns stocks.

252 2018-03-01 22:38:56 Post close update on stocks. Large enough down day to continue DOWN TREND, BUT NO BACK TO FULL HEDGES. Still in the range for now, but be careful and enjoy the ride.
253 2018-03-01 22:38:25 The thousands of likes regarding Trump's tariffs on STEEL and ALUMINIUM from our ALLIES is the most dangerous policy yet. STOCKS Just TANKED TODAY DOWN 400 more points. If you want to pay more for your cost of goods keep encouraging this idiot. There goes your so called raises.
254 2018-03-01 22:38:19 Correct me if I'm wrong, but that legislation banned full-autos. Which are still illegal. Feinstein, Cicilline, etc have submitted bills repeatedly (for years) that would ban all semi-autos (pistols, rifles, etc). I do not support that. Full-autos, and add on bump stocks? yes.
255 2018-03-01 22:38:07 Fiscally conservative?  No, government will always spend money.  How else can elected politicians know what stocks to buy to become millionaires, besides knowing which companies are getting lucrative government contracts?
256 2018-03-01 22:38:00 This is true the NRA suggested that the ATF should review their decision on bump stocks, than the NRA didn't send out an email alert that the ATF were taking comments on bump stocks, unlike M855 which the NRA did send out alerts for...
257 2018-03-01 22:37:49 Bump stocks are dumb af and you can’t be accurate with it  what’s your point??? You clearly show that you believe anything the media says. That’s why you think a fucking bumpstock makes the gun better 
258 2018-03-01 22:37:44 The answer is not in banning certain guns..its in making all guns conform to common sense laws. Like fixed clips on AR type guns..no capacity over 10 rounds for ANY gun. No bump stocks, silencers, close gun show loophole, upgrade BG checks, and at least encourage fingerprint tech
259 2018-03-01 22:37:25 Reuters said that steel/aluminum stocks rose while the #StockMarket went down.
What's in #Trumps portfolio? How about his friends?  Who stood to gain the most from todays announcement regarding tariffs?

260 2018-03-01 22:37:22 I know my stocks look way better than they ever did under Obama. Jus sayin....
261 2018-03-01 22:36:21 Deciding to start investing in stocks in trump era is a nightmare. Don’t know if I can play with my money that way.
262 2018-03-01 22:35:54 OK, so bump stocks are rubbish, and those who aren't losers do it properly and change out the interior of the gun - illegally? 

Baaa.
263 2018-03-01 22:35:43 Fat cats taking profits. They just have to explain it cause they had people buying stocks in a market up to fast on low volume. Started shirting market at 26k b4 all the vix bs explanations

273 2018-03-01 22:33:29 That’s the problem, a “one policy fits all”, Issa is insane and in fact dangerous. The first step isn’t to just ban anything it’s to slowly decrease the frequency, high capacity and assault specific features. Most of all prohibit detachable stocks, to make rifles too large to be
274 2018-03-01 22:33:19 Now that’s hilarious! Which I guess it’s partially true, knowing he would be gone, stocks started soaring the day after Hillary lost......

283 2018-03-01 22:30:54 Snap chat has always been crappy to me, all of a sudden you see a famous person down talk it, stocks when down, and people dislike it now...haha really?...people would get amused by the face crap...I admit I laughed at a few people
284 2018-03-01 22:30:53 @realDonaldTrump has American companies growing, and their stock prices, too. Days like these are great if waiting to jump in. Bad if if you need the money soon, but then you shouldn't be in stocks anyway.
285 2018-03-01 22:30:48 Well considering NONE of this crap will pass, other than bump stocks perhaps.  His face is fine.
286 2018-03-01 22:30:41 Jacked, I meant jacked. The H key is right next to the J, and my eyes, glare, sun, lint. Wtf. Jacked Up Steel Stocks by increasing costs.
287 2018-03-01 22:30:30 I think this is the year of the material stocks. They had a decade plus more period of downtrend. They are late cycle plays where i think we are with the economy heating up and inflation likely to get much higher with a fed that is behind the curve
288 2018-03-01 22:30:02 @thesinisterfish Any updates on the Gloomhaven sticker stocks?  I just recently got the game, and definitely want these direct from you, rather than get ripped-off by sellers on Amazon
289 2018-03-01 22:29:51 Yeah I don’t think Warren Buffet is too happy with the stock market right now. Just lost 3.7 billion dollars this week in stocks.
290 2018-03-01 22:29:33 I know my father’s stocks went up. Great news for American manufacturing! So sorry to deplete the Chinese& koreans labor market. Sure it will cost a little more, but I’m content with the fact that jobs will be here with no human rights violations!
291 2018-03-01 22:28:54 I do not agree on banning AR-15s or raising the age to purchase rifles.  If you are old enough to go to war at age 18, then you are old enough to buy a rifle.  Banning bump stocks makes sense.
292 2018-03-01 22:28:17 The news: "Warren Buffet lost $3.7 billion because US stocks are tumbling for the 3rd day in a row"

Me: "HAHA Warren Buffet's poor again!"

293 2018-03-01 22:27:43 Their prospectus says they have a 15% alloc to "Aggressive Growth Stocks", but ……… not sure Facebook counts as that at this point? I guess just buying the Qubes would do that.

295 2018-03-01 22:26:24 An EO for bump stocks, congress will need to pass something, input will be from trump meeting.
296 2018-03-01 22:26:19 If he really did it, it would hurt all manufacturers that use steel. General Motors stock is down three times as much as the general drop in stocks today.

298 2018-03-01 22:25:56 Yes but sometimes it is lagged just make sure  call TD Ameritrade to make sure you have no delays and if you can't see the level 2 on OTC stocks call them and they should activate that for you ,  I'm pretty sure they have those high scans . I don't use them I make my own scanners
299 2018-03-01 22:25:25 Do you honestly believe our government is trying to take away your guns? A majority of Americans want sensible gun laws like universal background checks no bump stocks raise age limit on SA weapons - no one is saying NO guns
300 2018-03-01 22:25:09 Most of Toyota’s are built here using mainly us materials.  They’re talking for the whole of the industry.  Some of the most “American” cars are actually Toyota’s.
301 2018-03-01 22:24:39 Yesterday, he stated that he would support banning bump stocks through executive order, halting state carry reciprocity, and raising the age to purchase semi-auto rifles.
302 2018-03-01 22:24:21 Stocks fell today as Mr. Trump made his comments about tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 industrial sector was down more than 2 percent.

307 2018-03-01 22:23:03 Dear Mr. President @POTUS @realDonaldTrump saw that U r penning the executive order banning bump stocks thank you for doing this you are saving lives. It was nice to see your heart again could you please undo your EO on DACA too. Then your free to concentrate on your agenda.

314 2018-03-01 22:21:58 $AREC jumped in today too
315 2018-03-01 22:21:33 As well, check your favorite corporation and see how much money they spent buying back stocks.
316 2018-03-01 22:21:27 Thank you for your response and for proving that there is some middle ground that hopefully we can all agree on. I honestly never understood why responsible gun owners were against background checks. What are your thoughts on bump stocks?
317 2018-03-01 22:21:10 Would the Las Vegas mass shooting have been prevented if current law had been enforced? Paddock passed his NICS bground check, & legally bought 33 guns in a year. And legally bought at least 12 bump stocks. How many mass shooting victims has the NICS saved since 1998? Not enough.
318 2018-03-01 22:21:09 Guns take needs to give.  Bump stocks for ccw, or
Std. Cap. Mags. For bump stocks
319 2018-03-01 22:20:31 I think I'm gonna hold out. Im sure that soul stocks are on the rise...

321 2018-03-01 22:19:55 Trade Tarif on Steel and Aluminum.  politics. X and Aluminum stocks gained 2.3B in mkt cap today. Rest of market down 328B.  These tariffs kill the Auto, Aerospace, Manufacturing, etc mkts, also = higher prices for US consumer.  
322 2018-03-01 22:19:39 US auto stocks hit hard today. 5 million US jobs are steel and aluminum price sensitive ... reckless protectionism.
323 2018-03-01 22:19:28 $SPX I do not expect anything worse than a double bottom at this point, it is always good to keep track of discounted stocks in coming few days for the ultimate pull back, act quickly when the chance comes and quit quickly if it doesn't go well, be a sniper.
324 2018-03-01 22:19:23 Companies that use steel and aluminum to produce goods, such as car makers, were among the hardest hit stocks. Shares of Ford Motor shed 3%, while General Motors declined 4%.  Shares of several U.S. steel and aluminum companies, meanwhile, rose after the tariffs were unveiled
325 2018-03-01 22:19:11 Not true. This American is on board  for stronger background checks, outlawing bump stocks and some limitation to certain magazines.  I also believe the real focus needs to be on the warped culture of violent video games, movies and music.
326 2018-03-01 22:18:59 So traitor trump decided to increase tariffs..were there trade talks regarding this..i doubt it and now, thanks to his move, stocks tanked and trade wars are threating...a spinless move by this chaotic WH not knowing what they are doing. #voteblue2018
327 2018-03-01 22:18:57 Right time to accumulate stocks which are at fresh 52 week low or even few are now at 2 year low.
328 2018-03-01 22:18:48 When the 2nd amendment was written, bump stocks, automatic weapons and high capacity magazines weren't invented yet
329 2018-03-01 22:18:45 Thanks to Trumps big mouth, U.S. stocks nosedive...
330 2018-03-01 22:18:03 enter canabix in your stocks app. should be abbrev. (BLOZF) and watch it for a while, not a bad idea
331 2018-03-01 22:17:26 Why are my stocks sinking like a rock
332 2018-03-01 22:17:09 Oh yeah can’t you tell from MA and V stocks that they are just getting killed? Lol
333 2018-03-01 22:16:21 I believe President Trump stumbled into a good idea. I agree, we should raise the age to buy guns, we should ban bump stocks, we should confiscate first and due process second. We shouldn't fear the NRA. Tell us what you think at Commentary Survey #GunReformNow
334 2018-03-01 22:15:58 It certainly would be interesting to see who was buying steel and aluminium stocks prior to the tariff announcement. No reason for these stocks to be rising +5% today - until that thought bubble.
335 2018-03-01 22:15:51 No surprise here—-Obuma cried on national TV after Sandayhook—-he was sooo sad for the 20 6-7 yr olds and the 6 adults—-then he approves bump-stocks and did nothing to make schools safer!!

339 2018-03-01 22:15:07 100% the assumption is that the market won't go higher and Steel stocks and the market can't both go higher its a stat made for TV but not meaningful.

343 2018-03-01 22:14:20 So media honesty will suddenly break out and Trump will praised for banning bump-stocks? The Democrat party would split in half and never-trumpers would hang themselves.

364 2018-03-01 22:08:15 Stocks fall on trade tariff concerns
365 2018-03-01 22:08:00 Yeeeeees!  Just spray it! Shellac it if you must. Omg. The hair flop & wrinkled dress...I thought everyone involved to the stocks!

368 2018-03-01 22:07:35 In Trumpland stocks took a dive fears of inflation cost of living rising but not a word on the tax scam transfer of over a trillion dollars to the rich burden placed on the rest...
369 2018-03-01 22:07:08 I think Trump is making it his mission to mess up my stocks
370 2018-03-01 22:06:45 Please stop spitting into the wind.  The U.S. runs on pocketbook issues whether we like it or not.  Unemployment across all sectors, especially blacks, is down to record levels.  Tax cuts have put more money in our pockets.  Stocks (& retirement plans) have made very nice gains.
371 2018-03-01 22:06:40 A tariff on Chinese dishwashers is one thing.
This proposal indicates that Trump is serious about broad sweeping tariffs that will have a significant impact on the economy.
If ever there was a time to sell stocks..
372 2018-03-01 22:05:52 Stocks are doing badly now and the expectation is that it will become worse!
373 2018-03-01 22:05:23 Is people selling Stocks to buy $BTC ?
374 2018-03-01 22:05:03 Still not a good sign for #crytocurrency . Investigations into $RIOT $CHIT $SSC $BLCK and many other #blockchaintechnology type stocks #blacklisted on trading platforms. Either, this is because the #upswing will be HUGE or we are looking at a complete collapse of the ecosystem.
375 2018-03-01 22:04:55 I think bump stocks should be banned so scrubs can’t shoot up schools but I am kinda dumbfounded by the age 21 thing

380 2018-03-01 22:04:18 Why have laws at all? Abolish all laws cuz they do not work 100%. Is this what you are saying? 
Ban auto and semi auto(bump stocks with this), ban pistol grips, ban magazines greater than 4 rounds, comprehensive background checks. This for starters.

383 2018-03-01 22:03:48 Jfc. Bump stocks. This would be the absolute LEAST they could possibly do. There is no reason in any universe why bump stocks should be sold. And they're STILL hemming and hawing about it. These people are monstrous. Vote them all out.
384 2018-03-01 22:03:34 1.Ban on sale of assault weapons/semiautomatic weapon. These weapons can fire rounds twice, three times as fast as a handgun. Today this is the primary demand from gun-control advocates.

385 2018-03-01 22:03:27 4.  It's already illegal for people on a restraining order to own, or possess, firearms.
5.  Yes ban bump stocks.  They violate the NFA.
6.  Yes raise the age to buy a gun, but understand that most shooters are white, male, and between 18 and 65 years of age. 2/

407 2018-03-01 21:59:23 I don’t own any bump stocks. They’re really more a toy than anything else. Not terribly useful. But I am bothered that the government wants to take them away.
408 2018-03-01 21:59:12 Be careful with the leftists, if you concede to the bump stocks soon they will be stealing the knifes from our kitchens, don’t be stupid!
409 2018-03-01 21:58:58 Tomi, the AR-15 was manufactured as a weapon of WAR. It does massive damage to the body. There is absolutely no reason for semi-automatic, bump stocks, automatic weapons to be on our streets. Our children,our people, have a right to life without war guns.
410 2018-03-01 21:58:55 Trump whiffs again.  Crushes stocks while he is at it.

411 2018-03-01 21:58:45 Bump stocks - good
412 2018-03-01 21:58:35 Because responsible gun owners will clear background checks, don’t need assault rifles, nor bump stocks, nor magazines with 30 rounds.
413 2018-03-01 21:58:33 Gun metal* boost. It’s not black in hand.
414 2018-03-01 21:58:28 You are living the life. I so admire you and envy you, too. I'm a Jordan wannabe. I'm working on stocks now. I've done 8 cruises, been to Hawaii, Costa Rica, Ixtapa and more places. How about the South Seas? Tahiti and so on? Haven't seen you there yet?

418 2018-03-01 21:56:46 Gee #NRAElites that's mighty magnanimous of you, MF. And how dare you discredit teens who went through hell you likely never went through as kids. Trump is setting Congress up about bump stocks and creating a comprehensive bill rather than a series of more narrowly designed bills
419 2018-03-01 21:56:39 You have to be careful with marijuana based stocks, though. While legal in some states, it's still against federal law, and they could seize profits as illegally earned drug money.

421 2018-03-01 21:56:10 Trump directly is responsible for the downfall of  420 points in stocks because of his messing unnecessarily with  tariff.

Obama had the stock market on a roll. The day Trump no nothing people came on board has been the worst decline in 2  years.

Retirement plans hurting.
422 2018-03-01 21:55:58 Does this apply to something legal prior to passage of a law?  For example, if Bump stocks are currently legal how can they pass a law that makes you a criminal if you continue to own a Bump stock?  That’s retroactively making ownership illegal.
423 2018-03-01 21:55:46 The @NRA
Wants bump stocks 
Is fine if a 18yr old kid wants to buy a AR15 with a 100 round magazine with no training.

They have no solutions to fix the broken background check system

They only speak for 5% of the gun owners it's time for a new group! These fools are the problem
424 2018-03-01 21:55:36 Time to buy bank stocks. To think McConnell is going to allow anything but more deregulation is crazy.
425 2018-03-01 21:55:24 Wonder if trump’s portfolio does better on a downturn of the market. He can pick up more stocks if they are cheaper. What is good financially for Trump is not necessarily what’s best for Americans.
426 2018-03-01 21:54:50 Being as you own a Sig Sauer, are you in favor of banning semi-automatic? Or do you want to do away with collapsible stocks, bump stocks, pistol grips, Barrel grips, high capacity magazines, things of that nature?
427 2018-03-01 21:54:47 Pane Jiráku, pokud vy jako občan ČR souhlasíte s nastalou situací a tím, že naší zemi řídí trestně stíhaný bývalý člen STB tak se stydím, že vás musím nazývat svým spoluobčanem. Generální tajemník ÚVANO pan Babiš měl být již dávno v propadlišti politických dějin. Bohužel není.
428 2018-03-01 21:53:26 Dow closes -420 is that my cue to buy pot stocks?
429 2018-03-01 21:53:13 Ban bump stocks, prevent gun purchases for mentally ill /under 21.  Waiting period of 2-3 weeks Most importantly fix the system of reporting to background check agencies so that actual relevant information comes up and things aren't missed.
430 2018-03-01 21:52:48 And it will be up again tomorrow. Protecting American workers and business won't devalue stocks for long. Foreign investors, especially Chinese probably all pulled out, but it will bounce back.
431 2018-03-01 21:52:41 This is a cracker. Came across this on our first holiday to Wales. We went back for another pint and the barrel ran out!
Luckily our local independent wine shop now stocks it....oh yeah!
432 2018-03-01 21:52:34 It would have been me if there had been stocks
433 2018-03-01 21:52:32 Unfortunately, you like your guns better than protecting American children being killed in schools by American citizens on a regular basis. You say I don't love this country because I wasn't raised. I speak against 2A while you stock up on guns and bump stocks #GOPlogic
434 2018-03-01 21:52:31 Pharmaceutical stocks plummet. Keep talking, Trump.
435 2018-03-01 21:51:39 $JBZY at a prime entry point. Ask @CS_Mdl_T800 and @Jym_Shoe when his pump crew is ready to prime this for launch! Go BABY!!!
436 2018-03-01 21:50:41 1.Ban on sale of assault weapons/semiautomatic weapon. These can fire rounds twice, three times as fast as a handgun. Today this is the primary demand from gun-control advocates
2. No purchases of guns under age 21
3.A ban on “bump stocks,” device that enables guns fire vry rapid
437 2018-03-01 21:50:38 Stocks sank sharply after Trump announced stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. @realDonaldTrump, still think the stock market loves you?
438 2018-03-01 21:50:37 Anyone with foreknowledge of Trump’s tariff announcement certainly could have made a lot of money buying steel stocks & shorting the rest of the market today - maybe even enough to pay off their $1.2 billion debt on 666 5th Ave.
439 2018-03-01 21:50:22 3) You and tons of others are terrified because the AR has black plastic furnishings instead of wood stocks. They resemble the M16, M16-A-1, etc., simply because they have black stock instead of wood. Get it? You're terrified of black plastic. Period. No other difference.
440 2018-03-01 21:49:51 So much simpler to ban assault rifles and bump stocks
441 2018-03-01 21:49:20 I sold my gun stocks too soon.
442 2018-03-01 21:49:19 Been lots of paperback sales today too - Amazon down to only 15 copies left, so hope they get stocks in soon.
443 2018-03-01 21:48:57 One thing is sure, like a typical GOP president, @realdonaldtrump is determined to scuttle the American economy. #Stocks #Tariffs #Idiot
444 2018-03-01 21:48:25 Stocks are toast. Leading indicator. Confidence lagging indicator
445 2018-03-01 21:48:09 Have read that bump stocks were originally designed to help people fire a gun who had problems using their hands/fingers.
446 2018-03-01 21:48:08 What’s going on with marijuana stocks today? The Dow dropped 420 points!

449 2018-03-01 21:47:03 Et bah, heureusement qu'on était prévenu que Cait ne vient qu'un jour et que par conséquent les stocks sont très limités (sachant qu'un duo est toujours limité).
450 2018-03-01 21:46:55 It's a start but let's face it, not many, in fact none, of these school killers use 'bump stocks' so..I actually think that's why it was done, looks good, accomplishes nothing. It really don't hurt the NRA at all. No impact
451 2018-03-01 21:46:42 March 2018 is d month where #Stocks destiny will be written 

#walgorix
452 2018-03-01 21:46:41 risky to wild fish stocks..surprised to see NOAA supporting this..
453 2018-03-01 21:46:37 Actually Ill change my mind on that -- If BTC cant close above $11k today, it will likely also drop back down with the stocks tomorrow.
454 2018-03-01 21:46:20 And only 1 used bump stocks. And all of them on this list combined for less than .001% of total gun deaths in the country in the same time frame!   Time to repeal the 2nd amendment!
455 2018-03-01 21:46:12 I don't believe $SPX was down today b/c of Tariffs. It was down b/c Powell is no friend to the mkt. IF bad, steel stocks would have been down. Bernanke asked for fiscal to assist monetary policy for yrs to no avail. Fed finally gets it and Powell dismisses it. THAT is a problem.
456 2018-03-01 21:46:03 Shorting resource stocks. Who could possibly benefit from that?
457 2018-03-01 21:45:49 Guess what, Joe? This morning you had a Republican congressman on, and he said “...I enjoy shooting my AR-15...” Yes’ it obviously was for practice at the range, but this is the attitude that makes America unsafe nowadays. He also said that he will sign on to ban bump stocks, but
458 2018-03-01 21:45:38 fwiw, puts are cheapest when a stock pokes its head up above the 9ema,  or you can chase them when they go into play ,, its all good,, most stocks will go down 20% others will lose 50%.. 'left to right',, dead simple
459 2018-03-01 21:45:22 Oh, Hi Wade.
I suppose you're correct...it appears just total nutters purchase bump stocks, AR-15s, and other rapid-fire guns that were only invented to indiscriminately kill as many humans as possible. #microphallus
I'm going to go ahead and keep my facts gayly forward.
460 2018-03-01 21:45:12 @DICK'S Sporting Goods, Thank you for tasking action!!
"The chain will stop selling assault-style rifles, end the sale of firearms to buyers under 21 (up from federal minimum age of 18), stop selling high-capacity magazines and continue to never sell controversial bump stocks."
461 2018-03-01 21:45:07 Glad I don’t own any automobile or beer stocks after Trump put tariffs on steel & aluminum.
462 2018-03-01 21:44:50 Home and Land  affordability are come likely if they have a decent investment plan stocks shares debentures bonds etc, without any of those, you shall not achieve investing into a home, if you need to purchase a land then a home, consider investing now.
463 2018-03-01 21:44:41 The only correlation maybe pump managers like mk try to pump bitcoin to cash out and buy real assets like stocks to move the money they have stolen from the naives from virtual world into real world before the bubble collapses completely
464 2018-03-01 21:43:51 It was 2$. You’d need +7% move one way to make money with 16 days. Stocks gone 16-44-22-29 crazy moves for small amount of premium.
465 2018-03-01 21:43:40 oh shit I totally thought it was Wednesday whoops my bad

No I think crypto will flourish this time when stocks fall. The only time I saw parity in their relationship was a couple weeks ago
466 2018-03-01 21:42:59 Stagflation is the best case scenari for stocks lol lower real rate
467 2018-03-01 21:42:21 Wait wait, hold on. The Jabari seclude themselves by choice. They also have their own stocks of virbranium-infused wood that goes toe-to-toe with any metal the rest of Wakanda uses. They also don't want the technological advancements that they view as non traditonal.
468 2018-03-01 21:42:03 Stocks Drop as Trump’s Tariffs Rattle Markets
469 2018-03-01 21:41:44 US stocks down today - but lots of earnings coming in beating expectations. Perfect - lower prices, higher expectations.
470 2018-03-01 21:41:39 I see very little cash - if at all flowing from stocks into cryptos. Most stock investment are from institutional investors - almost all  crypto investments are not from institutional investors. So how can there be cash flow between both ‘assets’? This is just bullshit!
471 2018-03-01 21:41:04 Can they not lose money if stocks go  down with an IRA? If I had an IRA and the market went on a downhill slide would what I had in there prior be safe?
472 2018-03-01 21:40:57 Yes Republicans.... please keep talking about your big tax scam. Here's the truth. Corporations who were already sitting on a ton of cash are celebrating their massive tax breaks by buying back stocks....not helping workers.
Bonuses.....$3 billion
Stock buybacks.....$200 billion.

476 2018-03-01 21:39:50 I don’t think I made any comment regarding which wheat was most expensive. Obviously   more expensive than Russia. Strong basis levels in Australia currently v Black Sea due to relatively low stocks and dry soil profile in eastern Australian states leading into seeding.
477 2018-03-01 21:38:29 It is apparent that US Stock markets have not reflected favorably to your Tarriffs on Steel & Aluminium. Stocks values over last 4 days have lost a value of $90billions. Tarriffs are two ways swords and other countries will react to that. Are you prepared for it?
478 2018-03-01 21:38:18 I'm guessing either suspenders or, more likely, rifle stocks
479 2018-03-01 21:38:16 Agreed. If stocks must plunge, so be it. Long past time to put American workers first in America.
480 2018-03-01 21:38:12 For stocks with high payout and slow earning growth probably not true. They are more bond like. Think utes with 65-75% payout and 2-3% EPS growth.
481 2018-03-01 21:38:06 @williamlegate Gun stocks getting crushed after hours. $AOBC and $RGR
482 2018-03-01 21:38:06 We can outlaw bump stocks, they are specifically designed to increase the rate of fire through spring coils in order to make a semi-automatic simulate the fire of a fully automatic. Fully automatics have been illegal since the 1930s.
483 2018-03-01 21:37:44 Did you buy low to sell high knowing domestic stocks would jump after announcing the new tarrifs Donny?

488 2018-03-01 21:36:08 L.L.Bean only sells firearms that are specific to hunting and the traditional outdoor shooting sports, and only at our Flagship store in Freeport, ME. We do not carry assault-style firearms, high-capacity firearms, AR-type firearms, bump stocks or handguns of any kind. ^lb
489 2018-03-01 21:35:56 I think buying high and seller higher is the best philosophy for trend traders. For this reason trend traders aren't put off by stocks like $IAG, $SEK, $BAL and #A2M that are near all time highs. In fact, they want to buy them. #trading #tradingphilosophy #trend #dyor #asx

497 2018-03-01 21:33:26 Bubba, why don't I see  you taking credit for the stocks' plunge?
498 2018-03-01 21:33:19 My gold and energy stocks came back pretty good at the end of the day.
499 2018-03-01 21:33:11 Only invest what you're willing to lose. It reckon it's worth it. Weed stocks perhaps?
500 2018-03-01 21:32:26 did he divest himself from these stocks before the announcement?
501 2018-03-01 21:32:20 Bump stocks do not allow rates even CLOSE to fully automatic weapons--and even if they did, you don't need a bump stock to "bump fire." Can do it with your hands.
502 2018-03-01 21:32:07 Trump says stupid shit and stocks tank. Rich hedgie types know he is full of shit and buy the dip and get rich when the stupid shit never happens.
503 2018-03-01 21:32:01 She's so smug. I wish we could put her in the stocks, like the old days, and let the Press Corps pelt her with rotting vegetables
504 2018-03-01 21:31:37 Key Fasteners stocks a complete range of PPE including gloves, hearing and eye protection, masks, coveralls & first aid.
505 2018-03-01 21:31:18 I love it when this happens. The stocks are on sale!

507 2018-03-01 21:30:33 My personal checklist for #GunLawReform:

- Mental & Criminal background checks
- Ban assault weapons, bump stocks & hi-cap magazines
- Age of 21 required
- Gun owner's license + training
- 1-week awaiting period

All of the above should be applied nation-wide! #CommonSense

509 2018-03-01 21:30:09 @realDonaldTrump Let's see:  February the worst month for stocks in 2 years. Just as Markets begin to rebound you announce tariffs. Down 400+ pts. March could be worse. If you take credit for the UP days you need to own the DOWN days too. I haven't heard you bragging recently...
510 2018-03-01 21:29:49 You think some small investors got steel stocks today that are through the roof doubt it computers and Washington did happening every few days or weeks it’s called manipulation hate to be so skeptical rich getting richer!
511 2018-03-01 21:29:11 Bump stocks are a non-issue. No one knew what they were until a few months ago. They are already history. Let’s forge ahead.
512 2018-03-01 21:29:00 Not enough drive to go one more for a round number, both stocks down.
513 2018-03-01 21:28:55 Hi Mike, I do still like Tech, but you have to be far more selective in this sector given where many of these stocks are trading-  Email me at info@newtonadvisor.com  I wrote about Tech last week and happy to pass on, if you'd like
514 2018-03-01 21:28:42 @RepTedDeutch why are bump stocks not on your list? They turn assault rifles into fully auto machine guns
515 2018-03-01 21:28:32 15 or even 10$ could be leaf’s next stop if the trend doesnt change! Damn all weed stocks looks the same :( Sad for people who bought in january
516 2018-03-01 21:28:28 Stocks down 420 after email is released showing the #KillerJs had another tough week in #Nascar.
517 2018-03-01 21:28:26 Some of those people are very delusional. Especially the ones against a ban on bump stocks.
518 2018-03-01 21:28:19 I've bought into $ifxy at .0003s and added some since -but the huge rally they had going coincided with their twitter pumps...
Ive been in OTC stocks that promise dividends and held on said date and still never received any. Regrettably I didnt sell much beyond .005

522 2018-03-01 21:27:44 And so much for my stocks after Trump talked tariffs.
523 2018-03-01 21:27:14 Okay I used the wrong terminology. I’m still in favor of banning AR-15 rifles and any similar weapons and bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. Not trying to call you a bad guy if you disagree.
524 2018-03-01 21:26:52 It'd boost stocks, profits & many markets if AKSteel AKS, US Steel X, Steel Dynamics STLD, Nucor Corp NUE,  Alcora Corp AA, @USSteelBuilders & other USA based steel/aluminum firms quickly announced incentives/prices for firms switching from foreign sources @realDonaldTrump
525 2018-03-01 21:26:45 There are many ways other than bump stocks to covert a semi-auto to auto. They should all require registration/approval.
526 2018-03-01 21:25:59 Looking for comments from traders etc.. on how to invest in steel stocks now with the tariffs for an article for @usnews.
527 2018-03-01 21:25:36 Ha! I wonder how many politicians have stocks in chinese steel companies?? The one's that are going to scream the loudest
528 2018-03-01 21:25:28 Let's recall according to mainstream media and economic experts Trump was supposed to generate a debacle for the US economy and stocks. The exact opposite happened. Strong biases do not help.
529 2018-03-01 21:25:02 It'd boost stocks, bottom lines & many markets if AKSteel AKS, US Steel X, Steel Dynamics STLD, Nucor Corp NUE,  Alcora Corp AA, @USSteelBuilders & other USA based steel/aluminum companies would announce special incentives/prices for firms switching from foreign sources @cvpayne
530 2018-03-01 21:24:45 I believe you. I'm no gun expert, but I've read some doctor reports of the serious damage of AR-15's & viewed a lot of wound & surgery photo comparisons w/reg. gunshot wounds. I am not anti gun but I am anti semi & auto, bump stocks, stuff that belongs in war zones imo.
531 2018-03-01 21:24:33 @SenGaryPeters ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines
532 2018-03-01 21:24:12 BREAKING--In a bold move designed to 'respond to the demands of our changing  times,' Starbucks, Inc. announced today that they will not sell bump  stocks for AR-15's.
533 2018-03-01 21:23:50 Seriously the DOW falls it means less fake money in stocks. It rises and it means less real money in the market place.

535 2018-03-01 21:23:35 You've heard adage-Not choosing is a choice? Maybe some similarity w/-Not regulating is regulating. Anyway, I'm tired of specious arguments re: non/regulation. Imagine your liberties & of others born&unborn if universal healthcare, habitable climate, clean water, no bump-stocks.
536 2018-03-01 21:23:30 No guns till age 21, no bump stocks, ban AR-15s & equivalent guns, ban multi-shot clips, ban body-shredding ammo, make background checks & registration universal, use red flags & restraining orders, no guns for those on no fly list, boycott NRA, vote out its puppets. #NeverAgain!
537 2018-03-01 21:23:12 You are so uneducated son. The stocks had biggest and second biggest drop in one week and guess under who?
538 2018-03-01 21:23:02 amazing how the media ignores the fascist ways of Captain Shit Stain and his fascist pig dog Dutton. A govt that view child rape as good for Jesus if they're not white needs to be transported to the stocks.

541 2018-03-01 21:22:39 Kill dollar, Save oil, thus stocks.  Gold reaps benefit.  I think our real retest of lows is next week.
And I hope (268 calls 3/16)

The volume on that day is insane
542 2018-03-01 21:22:36 Ed he is still on meth.  And maybe more. Tick tick Friday approaches and Donald is tweeting and flexing bs with tarrifs. Meanwhile gun stocks are down 5%   What does bob have in store for tommorow.
543 2018-03-01 21:22:25 @realDonaldTrump  what about the drop in stocks after you announce tarriffs. Everybody in the world knows it's a bad idea. Moron
544 2018-03-01 21:22:24 I think the easiest method of this is, prohibition if flash suppressors, silencers, detachable stocks, extended foregrips, bayonet mounts, and collapse to below 30”, also only 5, capacity 20+1  mags, and 21+, 3 day wait, background checks. However people today can print M-16’s
545 2018-03-01 21:22:10 With all the turmoil in the market I will look to possibly lighten my weakest stocks on a decent bounce tomorrow. I'm interested to see the put/call ratio tonight @IBDinvestors @SaitoChung to confirm the possiblity of significant fear.
546 2018-03-01 21:22:08 Answering questions concerning Stocks/Forex all weekend. 
547 2018-03-01 21:21:54 Bump Stocks?  Ban them.  AR-15s?  If you've gone through a series of rigorous mental and background checks, why not?  It won't be easy to set up the perfect system, but I know it can be done.  I want it to be done!  Shootings like FL & LV make responsible gun owners look bad.
548 2018-03-01 21:21:24 I don't think I could have chosen a worse week to start buying stocks lol.
549 2018-03-01 21:21:02 Great scoop Van! My 74 year old mother who is OBSESSED with cannabis stocks will love this.
550 2018-03-01 21:21:01 Smoot-Hayley revisited? Per market seers, the threat of tariffs on steel and aluminum tanked stocks. Except that stocks were acting like death over the past couple of days. Could they just be testing early Feb lows. Stay tuned.
551 2018-03-01 21:20:55 Trump Plans Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum and like magic, all their stocks went up.
552 2018-03-01 21:20:55 All supply no demand, you will not be able to sell it anywhere close to what you bought it at
553 2018-03-01 21:20:54 UPDATE:  U.S. stocks closed sharply lower today, with equities falling in a broad decline after Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Dow Jones closed at 24,608.98 (down 420.22 or 1.68%).
554 2018-03-01 21:20:48 Kind of regret binning 90% of my vinyl. I’m now searching Ebay to replenish my stocks!

556 2018-03-01 21:20:45 We have background checks, bump stocks ban is one thing, but the purposed law is any device resetting the trigger, or speeding up the rate of fire. Which may sound ok, but it’s not. This is going to be an attempt to ban all semiautomatic rifles.
557 2018-03-01 21:20:38 He said between 3/2 and 3/8 you’ll see the drop to around 8k and then bull run. So he has a few days to make good on the drop. The stocks have begun falling though, and bonds selling - which is what he said would be the start.

566 2018-03-01 21:18:30 Fox could have said Stocks crash after the sun came up today. Just as  stupid as their Trump commentary.
567 2018-03-01 21:18:24 Please tell me that you're going to address Trump's statements on due process, bump stocks, partnering with "Dianne," and scrubbing national reciprocity.
568 2018-03-01 21:18:20 and then the new head of the treasury wants to up interest rates a 1/4 of a point driving stocks down and taking away from consumer confidence. What's up with this?

577 2018-03-01 21:15:58 World stocks continue tumble: US & Europe -1.3%. Market enemy: US gov. dysfunction evident in full glory with staff departures & disagreements. This exacerbated by Trump’s ignorance of the negative impact of tariffs. Hold your breath.
578 2018-03-01 21:15:45 SO.. are we REALLY going to have all the treason and corruption exposed in plain sight, everyone with a molecule of patriotism expelled from the White House, watch the world economy on eave us in the dust while stocks plunge.. Sit helpless while citizens are massacred..

580 2018-03-01 21:15:39 Trump probably got his caporegimes to invest in steel stocks yesterday - they’ll wet their beaks and save a piece of the action for the Don.
581 2018-03-01 21:15:19 Fixes that, didn’t you? Stocks are crashing!
582 2018-03-01 21:15:17 Nice job.  Must all be pot stocks, crypto and smokes....
583 2018-03-01 21:15:14 Stocks were plunging on your tariffs. Oh, you're only President because Putin wanted you to be President. You're without Hope?
584 2018-03-01 21:14:26 It's a good thing they were on land then hey. No risk to the wild stocks at all. Makes sense to me. Imagine if they were in ocean pens and the virus got into the water and wild fish.
585 2018-03-01 21:14:20 He will never release them because he’s buying stocks of industries and manipulating the price.. how about today’s steel and aluminum Tariffs you think that’s because he likes steel.. how about coal, defense,pharma,gun makers  etc. etc.
586 2018-03-01 21:14:17 If you ban semi-autos, why do you need to ban bump stocks?

Just admit you want to ban all guns commie!
587 2018-03-01 21:14:09 The best time for Wellington is when the equities they own are "out of favor". Value stocks have fallen behind momentum plays, but that will not last forever. So for me,  I stay the course. Performance in this fund has been great and who doesn't like quarterly div's.

590 2018-03-01 21:13:41 I'd say we have talk of tariffs to thank for a day of cheap stocks...In my case, I think it worked out pretty well, as I had cash lying around...
591 2018-03-01 21:13:38 Is it possible Mercers it all brought back stocks last time to pull the DowJones out of the ditch & rescue Trump? Can economic journalists do research on this?
592 2018-03-01 21:12:59 Then why are stocks crashing? because your an fool and no one likes a fool.

S&P and Nasdaq -1.3% today.
597 2018-03-01 21:10:07 The critics would say these tariffs would drive consumer prices of goods up? I say, the tipping point would decrease corporate profits in order to maintain market prices. It would hurt stocks but maybe good for the overall US economy...

602 2018-03-01 21:08:57 This only means that govco employees and U.S. citizens won't be able buy bump stocks. Citizens of the several States (Art. 4, Sec 1, Cl. 2) have never been subject to presidential executive orders. And this area is the real battle for freedom.
603 2018-03-01 21:08:46 Don't ban bump stocks then president, it will do nothing but weaken you and the second ammendment!
604 2018-03-01 21:08:46 RE: Trump’s Tariff Announcements

You have to wonder if Eric and Jr. are buying stocks in US Co’s just before such announcements.
605 2018-03-01 21:08:36 I support banning assault weapon purchases. I just see no need for anyone not in the armed forces having them. What’s your position in assault weapons and bump stocks?
606 2018-03-01 21:08:29 So stocks plunge after President Trump announces harsh tariffs on metal imports to protect US firms.  Wondering if there is anything I could ever say to make the needle go either way?
607 2018-03-01 21:08:28 As someone who works closey with Fisheries I can say that avian predation is a distraction from the elephant in the room. Focus on poor catchment land management, poor agricultural compliance, water abstraction. That's before angling pressure on stressed stocks
608 2018-03-01 21:08:26 What about the Mexican influence? 

Carlos Slim doubled his investment in NYT to 18 % of traded stocks during the last election cycle;  since sold off some!

609 2018-03-01 21:08:24 Obama didn't toss out "due process" regarding nuts with guns. Bump stocks were allowed by ATF under his watch. Obama contributed to the 8 years of record profits for gun industry. During his first term alone,  26.1 million guns were produced. Fear mongering can backfire.

629 2018-03-01 21:01:46 Jonathan why don't you look into whether or not Trump's recent conversations with his friends and cronies who happen to own stocks that might be shorted or manipulated by such a revelation as tariffs with no lead up simply a blurting out
630 2018-03-01 21:01:32 But the DOW dropped 500 today. Maybe your rich buddies aren’t so confident. Regular hardworking Americans aren’t causing stocks to fall. Tout that.
631 2018-03-01 21:01:31 Great news! Toys R Us has just announced they will no longer sell AR-15's to people under 21. Or bump stocks. #2A

634 2018-03-01 21:01:14 Take back your executive order on bump stocks and stop making statements like you are going to illegally sieze guns from the "mentally ill". I voted for you as a 2A supporter and pro-life advocate.  Those are the 2 most important issues I vote on, sir.  Do not cave.
635 2018-03-01 21:01:03 2/3 of working Americans own stocks.
636 2018-03-01 21:01:02 Automatic weapons are already banned. Bump stocks (auto “conversions”) are specifically addressed here. Background checks are already required.
637 2018-03-01 21:00:58 See Everybody Tomorrow! Just Insane Volume in Trip 0 Stocks! March is going to be AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!
638 2018-03-01 21:00:47 it's like people trying to short stocks.
they don't have the time to wait for good offers.
because the longer they stay... the worse shit storm they will be tied to.
like watching your personal stock plummet in real time.
639 2018-03-01 21:00:36 The problem with a ban on bump stocks is writing the definition so that it doesn't cover things besides actual bump stocks.  The usual proposal is "anything that increases rate of fire", but that can include a lightened bolt carrier or a target trigger.
640 2018-03-01 21:00:36 Consumer confidence is up unemployment down manufacturing up. Stocks down WHAT Makes no sense. We see through the smoke
641 2018-03-01 21:00:35 @FoxBusiness Please! @CGasparino is a #HotHead Trump-Bashing RINO Idiot. Get Rid of him. The Stock Market is over reacting, what a great Opportunity to Buy, and my Steel and Aluminum Stocks are doing great! 
642 2018-03-01 21:00:20 This morning: Trump won’t announce tariffs
Trump: I’m announcing tariffs 
Stocks: 
643 2018-03-01 21:00:16 Covered half lower. In let it ride mode, Nice trade Michael for a guy that doesn't short stocks!
644 2018-03-01 21:00:08 Show that awesome day in stocks we are having due to your new policy.
645 2018-03-01 21:00:02 The realiry is that their stocks and sales are skyrocketing amid speculation that gun control will pass. Always happens in the wake of national tragedies.
646 2018-03-01 21:00:02 @ShepNewsTeam Hey Shep, you forgot to mention that steel and aluminum stocks went up today, even though the Dow Jones is down.  #MAGA
647 2018-03-01 20:59:48 I don't care about bump stocks, I do however care if someone who is 18 can bear arms in the military, and then come home and can't buy a fire arm.
648 2018-03-01 20:59:36 My stocks for the most part are holding up. Guess it pays to buy quality stocks after all.
649 2018-03-01 20:59:29 45 has whipsawed individual stocks in the past, and they came back.  We'll see.  Or maybe he's went long on US steel (stock symbol X).
650 2018-03-01 20:59:22 @facebook you need to put on everyone's page finance page so they can see stocks
651 2018-03-01 20:59:14 I wonder how Obama will be blamed for all of this. #stocks #tariffs
652 2018-03-01 20:59:10 Haha thank you! I had to practically take out stocks in hairspray 
653 2018-03-01 20:59:03 Gave US steel company stocks a noticeable tick up

655 2018-03-01 20:58:46 @DRUDGE_REPORT No, stocks are not "rocked by tariff talk". News rarely if ever moves markets. This is part of a NORMAL correction. When too many people get on one side of the trade, it has to rebalance.
656 2018-03-01 20:58:45 You think Donny or friends made any money on stocks today?????
657 2018-03-01 20:58:42 I love to hear all the experts on everything in the world that the GOP have  Tomi Lahren now  knows everything about "guns". Ask your handlers if the A.R was the predecessor of the M-16 And if they know who made the first plastic stocks for it
658 2018-03-01 20:58:24 So you think it smart to start a trade war?  Stocks crashing today.  thanks, trump.
659 2018-03-01 20:57:40 AR-15s sold in stores today don't have selective fire. It's the only reason it's legal to sell them. They can easily be modified though and bump stocks simulate full auto.
660 2018-03-01 20:57:23 Overnight: Fed's Powell trumped by US President confirming he plans to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminium next week... #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities
661 2018-03-01 20:57:22 Wait a min. This is longer term right. Google trends up this week, and small% of money outta stocks flowibg into BTC.. this is what I drew outta that fall in stock prices today!!

663 2018-03-01 20:56:42 No effect to the wild stocks though. Price of doing business shouldn't include environmental destruction. Doing it the right way cost more money but has less impact on wild stocks. 
Not the case with at sea pens. Save money but wreak havoc on the wild stocks. #youshouldknowthis

665 2018-03-01 20:56:14 Stocks are down, does that translate to sales being down too?
666 2018-03-01 20:56:10 Good question. I honestly don’t know (don’t buy too many stocks on margin).
667 2018-03-01 20:56:07 1.Ban on sale of assault weapons/semiautomatic weapon. These weapons can fire rounds twice, three times as fast as a handgun. Today this is the primary demand from gun-control advocates.
2. No purchases of guns under age 21.
3.A ban on “bump stocks,” a device that enables guns.
668 2018-03-01 20:55:55 Any word if @realDonaldTrump cares if stocks are getting murdered thanks to his hare-brained ideas about tariffs? He seems to only notice when stocks go up because #FoxNews
669 2018-03-01 20:55:04 Good news for heavy-duty antiperspirant stocks.
670 2018-03-01 20:54:41 Ban ANY device that changes the nature of ANY gun or rifle! Not just "Bump Stocks". The gun industry already has several devices and will only make more to get around Bump Stocks...

672 2018-03-01 20:54:01 Is 21 really that bad n bump stocks are a joke what the hell is he supposed to do hes getting mauled from everywhere who comes to his defence xcept for soc media no one give a little
673 2018-03-01 20:53:42 How about you ban all semi automatic/automatic guns, bump stocks and have the same licensing laws as we have here in Scotland, or would that mean to big a drop in NRA contributions to the next election campaign??
674 2018-03-01 20:53:32 les stocks doivent êtres sacrement limités 
675 2018-03-01 20:53:28 First off background checks are as far as I know universal, if you did not know it there is a ban on Assault weapons, bump stocks I can see a ban. You really want to stop the gun violence stop letting Dem's buy guns they do all the killings, look it up!
676 2018-03-01 20:53:25 Not limiting necessarily. They are increasing age of which to buy guns and I think they are trying to ban bump stocks.
677 2018-03-01 20:53:22 Rep. @CareyHamilton1 comments on the legislature's unwillingness to discuss commonsense gun measures. She drafted an amendment that would have banned bump stocks in Indiana. However, the bill was not called down. #IHDC #INLegis
678 2018-03-01 20:53:17 Also big difference between @ShannonFabrics  that consistent stocks certain things and is cautious to add styles and other sources that have different offerings each time
679 2018-03-01 20:52:49 Now we are comparing bump stocks to booze.    "Some WHERE over the rainbow, you'll make a point soon."
680 2018-03-01 20:52:41 Massive amounts of money being burned here so people can say - look we are still positive on the year. Yay! Baghodl stocks until the recession 
681 2018-03-01 20:52:41 I’ve been watching the same one. It’s been nothing but spot on, he did say stocks would dump first and they’re way down.
682 2018-03-01 20:52:28 If you're retired and trying to make your money last or paying you're RMD's it sucks!

Oh, and thanks to you potus, rhyan and mcconnell for the tax cut for the already rich!

Oops, to the businesses  who already bought back there stocks.

TOUGH!
683 2018-03-01 20:52:14 $BTC has become the perfect hedge on stocks and the dollar; which gold used to be ... both act as a deflationary (finite supply) store of value.  However, it’s much easier to transfer and trade BTC making it more suitable for today
684 2018-03-01 20:52:08 Unlike other days, you REALLY CAN BE BLAMED for the Stock Market performance today. How damn stupid are you? Are you capable of just shutting the fuck up?  Nice move "Great Negotiator". #MAGA #stocks #StockMarketToday #ImpeachTrump

686 2018-03-01 20:51:51 I am not defending this - I used several new curse words I learned in Finnish and all my English/German curses when this hit the news wires. But I'm trying to see the upside. We shall see... #steeltariffs #tariffs #stocks #freetrade
687 2018-03-01 20:51:46 I’m really impressed with certain stocks that look to close green today. These should get your attention for further research. $STUDY
688 2018-03-01 20:51:14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell sharply on Thursday after President Donald Trump said the United States would impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum, adding fears of a tit-for-tat trade war to growing worries about higher interest rates.
689 2018-03-01 20:51:05 Concerts and sports events hire armed security guards not teachers. I'm fine with armed & trained security guards at schools but arming teachers is the dumbest idea I have ever heard of
690 2018-03-01 20:50:49 Nigel Farages' tinted vision, being beutifully ruined by the Tories. Reasonable staunch Brexiteer is non-existant. Set up stocks in parliament square, public shaming for all involved
691 2018-03-01 20:50:48 To be clear, I'd be happy for bump stocks to be banned and think we should get rid of as many guns as we can.  But this guy doesn't believe anyone has any rights but him.  2/
692 2018-03-01 20:50:15 Stocks are down 500+ points since you dropped that tariff bomb today.

714 2018-03-01 20:44:27 The long term returns to Canadian stocks are almost entirely attributable to our banking oligopoly.

722 2018-03-01 20:43:25 how are the stocks doing?  LMFAO
723 2018-03-01 20:43:23 Trump was being politically stupid to tout the #stockmarket as a measure of his policy success - stocks do their own thing and make everyone look bad at times - but it was even dumber if he planed all along to start firing bullets at stocks with tariffs.
724 2018-03-01 20:43:17 Yep. Love mine. I even bought a smaller one which I love similarly for doing smaller portions. Stews, stocks, pulses and braises are a revalation with one.

738 2018-03-01 20:41:16 Yeah but not before he takes their guns 1st, has due process 2nd, bans assault rifles, and then takes away bump stocks regardless of what Congress says

Thank God we have a president who stands up for American rights, not like that old Obama
739 2018-03-01 20:41:11 many actions to harm multiple individuals. They likely would uphold bans on detachable stocks, silencers, flash suppressors and extended foregrips/bayonets even mags over 30+1 rds and purchase requirements...but others they would not. Also statistics contribute #GunControlNow
740 2018-03-01 20:41:04 The #tariff news was the worst kept secret in history. I got a call from a buy-sider who made $70MM last year:

Me: "A little. Long index vol x 120K($/pt) 

Him: "Get short cyclicals"

Me: "Fins as well?" (financials)

Him: "No"

745 2018-03-01 20:40:01 Meanwhile auto industry (5 million employees when you add Tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers with auto companies)—their stocks are tanking.
746 2018-03-01 20:39:46 Stocks will sore again when American steel gets big contracts.
All this is... buying opportunity.
747 2018-03-01 20:39:26 To be clear, *somebody mentioned on Twitter that 'basement dwellers' has 2 meanings and i didn't know that it refers to stocks but now i can pretend that i did*
748 2018-03-01 20:39:07 Inflation leads to rate hikes.  Everything bought with debt or leverage, i.e. homes, stocks, companies, reprices lower.
749 2018-03-01 20:39:05 How? The assault weapon ban basically banned pistol grips and grenade launchers on rifles. It didn't ban semi-automatic weapons, and I have no idea how bump stocks are actually legal in the first place (automatic weapons aren't, and this is a modification that makes one).
750 2018-03-01 20:38:43 #marcorubio- say no to assault weapons, bump stocks, semi automatics,NRA. Yes to better background checks & age minimums. You appear weak
751 2018-03-01 20:38:42 Have you heard about S.1505, SHUSH ("Silencers Help Us Save Hearing") Act? Maybe H.R.3139, the Hearing Protection Act? It would treat silencers "the same as firearms accessories," meaning few restrictions. First bump stocks, now silencers! #NeverAgain #CallCongress #GunControlNow
752 2018-03-01 20:38:41 Buy, don't sell, stocks like Boeing and Apple on declines
753 2018-03-01 20:38:20 Pretty sure @realDonaldTrump announced tariffs today to sink stocks so people focus on it rather than Hicks resignation and Mueller's inquiry focus on #Trump actions... not his team's actions. Willing to hurt US businesses & citizen's investments just to distract us momentarily.

755 2018-03-01 20:38:12 I agree, but stocks will drop 25%+ before that happens.
756 2018-03-01 20:38:03 Today's market dip is just dumb! Lotsa stocks not directly impacted by the price of steel but still knocked down 2-3%!!! JNJ, AAPL, UA, WING & ABT to name a few!
757 2018-03-01 20:37:48 Rick Santelli's happy about stocks crashing......wonderful
758 2018-03-01 20:37:46 .... Fed will totally reverse QT if stocks keep dropping. The only avenue left is robbery thru inflation, like always.
759 2018-03-01 20:37:13 Oh yes dump all stocks 
760 2018-03-01 20:37:12 45 announces tariffs on steel and aluminum, stocks plummet.  Thanks, Clueless Donny!#trumpsterfire
761 2018-03-01 20:37:02 He also used 50-75 round clips on modified AR-15s, AR-10s, and AKs with bump stocks, which I agree should have been illegal in the first place, and are being made illegal soon.
762 2018-03-01 20:36:43 . I’m not flipping anything. This is awful policy making. Stocks are worth less by an unknowable amount. Not interested.
763 2018-03-01 20:36:41 Slow your roll Mr. President.  If you can fight to protect our country.  You have a right to protect yourself.  Commonsense. Don't mess with our guns. Background checks, bump stocks and mental health need to be addressed.  Not age requirements and magazines under 15 rounds.

777 2018-03-01 20:33:56 With todays rushed, crazy and out-of-nowhere announcement by @realDonaldTrump and cohort money launderer @SecretaryRoss re: steel & aluminum tariffs...I wonder who just bought stocks?? Hhmmmm?
778 2018-03-01 20:33:50 The #tariff news was the worst kept secret in history. I got a call from a buy-sider who made $70MM last year:

Him: "You short Street?" (Single-names/stocks)

Me: "A little. Long index vol x 120K($/pt) 

Him: "Get short cyclicals"

Me: "Fins as well?" (financials)

Him: "No"
779 2018-03-01 20:33:48 Do you think he gives his friends a heads up to get out of foreign metal stocks and related investments before implementing these these tarrifs?
780 2018-03-01 20:33:47 You don’t seem particularly bright: my point is you’re spazzing out about things you don’t have control over.  “OMG, what if sales is $10M??”  I don’t care what consensus is.  Nobody knows.  Perhaps stocks aren’t for you, maybe a CD?
781 2018-03-01 20:33:44 Silver, grains, gold and silver mining stocks as well as conservative REITs offer value and are attractive asset classes. Blue Chip Gold mines the best of the lot.  #gold #silver #goldmines #reits #grains

783 2018-03-01 20:32:12 @realDonaldTrump Sir, please get your house in order because my stocks keep going down! And because it’s what the citizens want. That is all.
784 2018-03-01 20:32:00 Now because the tariffs are on their way , like I said today stocks are dropping and it's the start of a recession . Thanks to Trump . We are fucked .
785 2018-03-01 20:31:51 A regular hunting rifle can fire just as fast as an AR 15. Even bolt action rifles. ARs are lighter & formed to be easier to carry. And bump stocks won't turn it into a an automatic! It's being used as a "we're doing somethin" issue cuz people don't know what it's really about!

802 2018-03-01 20:27:34 The #2A is just fine, donchoo worry about that, sir.  Instead, take care of stringent background checks, bump stocks/accessorizing, private sales with no oversight, the improvement of law enforcement comms, state reciprocity, and STOP CIVILIAN TEENS FROM BUYING #AssaultWeapons

804 2018-03-01 20:26:52 In less than 24 hours Trump has talked about signing an EO to ban bump stocks, adding a semi-auto ban to a gun control bill, said police should break in & take someone’s guns, and is now meeting games industry people to pin the gun violence blame on them.

Alt-right is doomed.

818 2018-03-01 20:24:33 On the just announced trade #tariffs: It's essentially a battle between Gary Cohn and Peter Navarro. Until today Cohn was clearly winning. Now, the idea of Navarro gaining influence is a more tangible concern. And in between these blows the American #economy could suffer. #stocks

820 2018-03-01 20:24:10 I think bump stocks are dumb and could care less if they are banned. But they can be made with a few bolts in a kitchen. How do you ban that?

822 2018-03-01 20:23:52 Tell that to the family members of the many victims of Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas, Columbine, you heartless monster!

Banning semi automatic weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, etc would cover allow of the mass shootings on that nonsensical list.

826 2018-03-01 20:23:23 Thank you to the POTUS for killing my stocks today with your idiotic tariff BS. This is a global economy dimwit. Congrats on reversing what had been the only positive of your presidency so far.
827 2018-03-01 20:23:18 I think everyone agrees bump stocks should be illegal (since automatic weapons have been since 1986). "It won't solve the problem" doesn't mean we shouldn't start there. So what's taking so long? Here's a draft:

"The sale and/or manufacture of bump stocks is illegal"
828 2018-03-01 20:22:47 @realDonaldTrump 16 US steel stocks market cap up $1B as a result of your tariff announcement today.  Rest of S&P 500 down $400B.

845 2018-03-01 20:18:27 Very sad that this mis-informed view is being tweeted. UK salmon stocks are being decimated by fish eating birds. No angler or conservationist wants to see any animal killed but management of fish stocks and bird populations is vital.
846 2018-03-01 20:18:21 @CNBCClosingBell All my friends have taken off work and are selling their stocks.  Oh, no, maybe it’s the Institutions selling to manipulate the market in their favor.  Get real. Where are your statistics about that?

857 2018-03-01 20:15:23 Fear that Trump raising tariffs on steel and aluminum imports might start a trade war sent stocks tumbling today.

861 2018-03-01 20:15:10 There is little I can do about it. The fewer bans on things, the better. In the specific case of bump stocks, I don't think not having one will threaten your safety. I could be wrong.

873 2018-03-01 20:13:36 If you add a stock and foregrip to a pistol, you can increase the rate of fire and accuracy (it’s why SMGs have collapsible or folding stocks). The range is not affected because the barrel and ammo is still the same. Dress a pistol like an AR, it’s still a pistol.

Please don't bend over too far to the left's gun control agenda.  Raising the age to 21, outlaw bump stocks and stronger background checks, remove guns from the mentally ill and domestic violent offenders.   Give them NO MORE, ever.
884 2018-03-01 20:12:16 To little, too late. After being publicly shamed, and with his public support dwindling, he's announcing palliative measures which will fail to solve the problem. Without saying so, he stand by the NRA by refusing to ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks!

Who does that really hurt and you take the "Gun Issue" off the table. Gone from all future elections.

901 2018-03-01 20:08:50 Correct in that, Bump Stocks take away the reaction time of the person using the gun and cause it to fire faster than it would normally.

905 2018-03-01 20:07:57 put another way - I have more confidence in Fed hiking than I do stocks rallying
906 2018-03-01 20:07:45 stocks will recover as American steel builds up
907 2018-03-01 20:07:31 No, what wrong is billions in sold stocks based on speculation/future even before an official action is taken.
908 2018-03-01 20:07:25 personally think it's good opportunity as situation has changed IMO - stocks have to drop a lot to pull Fed out of play.   risk reward still skewed towards cycle continuing into early 2020
909 2018-03-01 20:07:20 $BPMX - bulls taking back full control! Looks like that was a bear trap
$CEI - putting in work as well
$MNGA - drop was expected- history shows it never holds its gains.

913 2018-03-01 20:06:19 Let you in on something. Wall Street controls stock market. When stocks fall to much. They close.

916 2018-03-01 20:06:04 The front end has been amazing.   The bids really show up when stocks sell off
917 2018-03-01 20:06:03 Trish, do your homework and see how much steel USA has imported from China. Also look at the financials for USA steel stocks.  $$$.   There are near 200 antidumping cases against steel.  Protectionism is bad.  Let the trade wars begin so Trump can see this is a foul move.
918 2018-03-01 20:05:52 That's great, but I'm having trouble imagining a supermarket that stocks guns and ammunition in the first place. Regardless, good for them.

920 2018-03-01 20:05:39 Overreacting to the #tariffs - does this mean #inflation - the 10 yr yield has not gone up - usually the 10 yr T #bonds would rise to signal #inflation #stocks #StockMarket #markets #Dow #Nasdaq100 #SP500 #WallStreet #economics #economy
921 2018-03-01 20:05:30 Thanks a lot @realDonaldTrump. You threaten to start a trade war and we now have to run and shift all our stocks and college funds before we lose our shirts. Thanks for playing with peoples lives you fucking shithead! I hope you rot in hell.
922 2018-03-01 20:05:19 @petenajarian It is not rates, it is fear that Trump does not know what he is doing--clumsy populism.  Will harm stocks and lose Congress in 2018.  Inflation will hurt GOP.
923 2018-03-01 20:05:17 Do you really think this guy was alone in this tragedy? No mention of the helicopter that was flying over spraying rounds with full auto machine guns. Yes let's just ban bump stocks. This" woman," makes Harry Reid look like a saint.
924 2018-03-01 20:05:15 They had bump stocks
925 2018-03-01 20:05:02 What they are designed for is to kill people. Bump stocks are legal so it’s a modification, like adding a night scope or a 150 round magazine.
926 2018-03-01 20:04:54 I invest in trump stocks
927 2018-03-01 20:04:50 When I take my family for ice cream on Sunday me and the misses carry AR-15s with bump stocks and 250 round magazines. How else can we protect Bubba junior?
928 2018-03-01 20:04:47 Bump stocks don’t turn semis into autos. This is a fact, not an opinion. If they did, then the ATF could handle the ban. The president doesn’t have the right to do what you’re saying. Repeating that he does over and over doesn’t change that fact.
929 2018-03-01 20:04:45 Yeah dxy stick save for stocks

930 2018-03-01 20:04:32 No guns till 21 w/out parental consent or military service, No bump stocks or body-shredding ammo w/out background check, make background checks universal, use red flags & restraining orders, no guns for those on no fly list, allow pro-gun alternatives 2 NRA 2 speak. #NeverAgain!
931 2018-03-01 20:04:25 Yea that's what I meant not a car that has been imported. I could be wrong but I can't see it making a car cost more than 500.00 more. But should create thousands of jobs. Buy stocks in steel and aluminum American company's.

940 2018-03-01 20:02:36 $BA most red among the $DJIA stocks
that's a first
941 2018-03-01 20:02:08 Stocks do have this risk, dilution is very common and can be arbitrary. You can get varying protections against these risks through legal contracts which shifts the risk up to the contract enforcement layer. Even if something has a risk doesn't mean it doesn't have value though
942 2018-03-01 20:01:58 Does President Trump not own any stock? For Pete's sake, man. I bought some stock near the time the tax cut was passed. My back of the napkin calculation has me losing enough on those stocks if I cashed out to wash out my potential gain from the tax cut.
943 2018-03-01 20:01:57 The executive doesn’t have that right. Even Obama knew this. Bump stocks don’t turn semis into autos. They just don’t. Trump will have to go thru Congress.
944 2018-03-01 20:01:29 Did you also mention how insane it is that bump stocks are legal and we still have gun show loopholes and how crazy it is that assault weapons are not regulated or even banned? Of course you did, right?
945 2018-03-01 20:01:24 In The Market: This is a curious sell-off, and good for stock pickers. While #steel #stocks are up, defensive sectors such as #medical supplies, #generics, #grains get trampled. US Treasury 10-yr yield inches lower to 2.81%, yet #fear is up, likely on #trade #war concerns #bonds
946 2018-03-01 20:01:16 Stocks drop dramatically (near 500 pts for DOW), while MBS rallies, up 25bps and Yields drop to 2.80%.  President Trump announces tarriffs for Steel and Aluminum Industries.  Investors concerned over possible Trade War.
947 2018-03-01 20:01:13 That's why there's all sorts of loophole shit like fin grips, angled foregrips, open-top stocks, bullet buttons (now illegal, sorta)...

It's a fucking travesty the lengths people will go through to avoid responsibility.
948 2018-03-01 20:01:03 Thank you President Obama. Track the graft on economy, unemployment, stocks and you'll see the growth straight up starting with Obama. Trump gets in on the tail end and you think he gets credit.

952 2018-03-01 19:59:37 unsurprisingly, stocks of companies that use steel & aluminum inputs, and/or that may face retaliatory tariffs, are tanking. again, what happened to "not picking winners and losers"?
953 2018-03-01 19:59:32 #stocks down, yields down. How quickly the narrative changes. Lots on #MOC starting now on @TDANetwork

961 2018-03-01 19:57:03 I've only been in the market for a couple weeks and my returns in crypto are way bigger than my returns in stocks. Keep in mind I invested a little before the dip and some after the dip. I've been very cautious but attempting to read everything I find. Something to think about.
962 2018-03-01 19:56:52 I'm worried if it's like $10 M, then all of a sudden this is a launch stock that isn't missing numbers.  Launch stocks that hit numbers: $SRPT , $NBIX ... etc.
963 2018-03-01 19:56:33 Inflation seems to have been a causal factor in the 1973-74 bear market. The impact on stocks probably comes from: (1) cash flow and expense burdens of interest rates that include provision for inflation; and (2) the uncertainty inflation creates.

This is not the first time announcements have fluctuated stocks. With inside info = large profits

Are you really going to say that?

977 2018-03-01 19:53:05 this is only Day 2 of the pot stocks rally. If WEED breaks $30, then the sector will be really off to the races.
978 2018-03-01 19:52:40 At least the steel stocks are up.
979 2018-03-01 19:52:14 We do have those background checks. "Cool-off periods" has different meanings but many states have something like that; there's no evidence it does any good. Bump stocks are useless but not sure they can be banned w/out banning semi-auto.

988 2018-03-01 19:50:59 So... jack up the prices on the imports so the Auto stocks tank?  BRILLIANT!
989 2018-03-01 19:50:20 They are when stocks go up, but not when they go down.
990 2018-03-01 19:50:19 Personally it was because of @POTUS remarks. He pandered jumping on irrelevant bump stocks and guns. This tragedy should have been prevented numerous times. School administrators and local and federal law enforcement. Mental health. @POTUS was disappointing
991 2018-03-01 19:50:04 "Stocks plunged Thursday after President Trump announced plans to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The Dow dropped more than 500 points in mid-afternoon trading following the announcement."

997 2018-03-01 19:49:17 Historically for US Stocks, a strong January followed by a weak February is extremely normal. In fact, anything else would mathematically be abnormal. Let's just keep things in perspective without the need to exaggerate.

1003 2018-03-01 19:47:45 The trouble with him trying to set any sort of limits is that it falls under the word/term “ infringed “. Bump stocks don’t infringe as they are an accessory, however almost all of the rest of these “ great ideas “  are infringement on a persons 2A rights.

1022 2018-03-01 19:44:43 Ban the sale & possession of semi automatic weapons, ban bump stocks, demand background checks for every firearm sale. And then as a encore, propose that we start registering guns & inspecting them yearly, like we do with the cars we own.
1023 2018-03-01 19:44:42 Impact of rising US rates on consumer spending more serious than bonds. New York Fed says total household debt hit record $13.15 trillion end 2017. Mortgages were $8.88 trn; student loans $1.38 trn, auto loans $1,18 trn & credit cards $1.04 trn. #spending #economy #bonds #stocks
1024 2018-03-01 19:44:24 I fail to see how a background check, banning bump stocks, punishes law abiding gun owners?  How does that prevent you from buying a gun?
1025 2018-03-01 19:44:22 energy and mining stocks not a bad place to be right now
1026 2018-03-01 19:44:14 Today is the kind of day when you wish you could swap the live stock for stocks and shares and let a stock broker look after things #shocker
1027 2018-03-01 19:44:11 @RampCapitalLLC Stocks down 2%, but when Bitcoin is up 5% who cares
1028 2018-03-01 19:44:02 There are far more important thing you could be doing with your time:
1. Work on stricter gun control legislation that bans bump stocks & assault rifles plus strengthens the background check system. 
2. Impeach our POTUS for not enforcing Russian sanctions passed by Congress.
1029 2018-03-01 19:43:30 NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. stocks dropped sharply in another dizzying day of trading as investors feared that Trump administration tariffs on imported steel and aluminum will lead to retaliation from other countries. The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 500 points.
1030 2018-03-01 19:43:27 Trade wars aren’t good for stocks Donald
1031 2018-03-01 19:43:25 How's that executive order disallowing bump stocks going? CRICKETS!! #TheWorldIsWatching you....so stop lying!
1032 2018-03-01 19:43:20 I wonder who had the inside info on this and sold their stocks before the announcement?
1033 2018-03-01 19:43:06 you like it with a spread like that? Bid .25 ask 2.00? Trapcity!
1034 2018-03-01 19:43:02 Now, after enough variety of comments appeared, it’ll be good time to reveal that it was a sarcasm  - a kind of parody on media, that 1st reaction to any event should be always the same: “Trump’s fault”

Stocks volatility is going a while and have nothing to do with any tariffs..
1035 2018-03-01 19:42:50 I guess what we need is to bump stocks, amirite?
1036 2018-03-01 19:42:27 You and Fox News can “dumb down” your message, but that doesn’t change the fundamentals of the world economy. Check out the DOW, Einstein. #stocks
1037 2018-03-01 19:42:26 2018 has been brutal for the Bond Markets. So much so that I believe stocks are currently a safer investment than bonds.
1038 2018-03-01 19:42:14 Sure.  The disparity is probably driven by momentum investors whether they are buying individual stocks, momentum mutual funds or momentum ETFs.
1039 2018-03-01 19:42:02 Christ knows, but it’s been a profitable correction. Hope the stocks I hold don’t follow suit tomorrow 
1040 2018-03-01 19:41:58 Yet any suggestion of limiting access by age or banning bump stocks or stopping access to military-style assault weapons have been met with blockage by the NRA.

If it really cared about life, it would invest in smart gun technology.  Or accept reasonable reform on guns.
1041 2018-03-01 19:41:48 I see lots of quotes from very old men. These men are gone today. So are those weapons. You want your 2A, I'll give you a musket. But AR 15s, high capacity magazines and bump stocks have to go. I repeat, you may not like it but we're gonna keep pushing for it.
1042 2018-03-01 19:41:10 In theory stocks should rally when bonds sell-off, but it's looking like this administration has officially triggered a bear market in bonds, stocks and the #USD. #Gold $GLD is the hedge to #Tradewars & #Currencywars, expect gold to rise from its ashes as the once and future king
1043 2018-03-01 19:40:58 Lots of em stocks are up. selling quite focused (us large cap) or just my lucky day?
1044 2018-03-01 19:40:32 GREAT JOB KING TURNIP HOPE YOU OWNED SOME STOCKS LOL

1047 2018-03-01 19:40:16 I have been waiting for the stock market to be down again to buy some more general stocks at a cheaper price.
1048 2018-03-01 19:40:14 Cenk keeps falling for it with bump stocks like Lucy and the football and it's weird

He gave credit for it after Vegas and now Parkland.

Okay maybe it'll happen but can we wait for follow through this time

More gun control action by Dicks Sporting Goods than Trump/congress ffs

1052 2018-03-01 19:39:45 I think that it's for the first time in history you see the world is buying Bitcoin to hedge against Metals and stocks for a short period of time but only imagine what's going to happen if a real crisis is hitting the economy.
1053 2018-03-01 19:39:35 So, let’s set a tariff. Stocks tumble. Can we remove some tariffs and then add one?
1054 2018-03-01 19:38:55 Wonder how many of his friends shorted stocks yesterday!

1058 2018-03-01 19:38:13 Of course the DOW would Drop. People are selling  stock in Chinese companies. I expect a buy back tomorrow for American stocks.
1059 2018-03-01 19:38:03 And stocks tumble after announcement.
1060 2018-03-01 19:37:57 Trump and friends are now buying stocks. And will sell next week when Trump rewoke this, and the stocks rise
1061 2018-03-01 19:37:31 Are the stocks overseas companies? Wait for the shift to american stock owned companies
1062 2018-03-01 19:37:14 Do you still favor raising the age from 18 to 21? When are you issuing exec order on bump stocks?
1063 2018-03-01 19:36:56 What stocks? Do you mean the foreign company's stocks that the liberals invest in? Instead of investing in their own country! I think that's the point, don't you?
1064 2018-03-01 19:36:28 nah dude....forget all that....don't you see that this afternoon with the tariff announcement money came "out of stocks and into wheat and soybeans"!!!!!!!!
1065 2018-03-01 19:35:38 #Markets r down 460 right now (& that's off the lows) in part due to lack of coherence in our foreign policy & trade policy, & the accelerating chaos in the WH. And crappy markets affect the economy - when people's 401k/stocks are down, they spend less. Nov can't come fast enough

1067 2018-03-01 19:34:57 I'm over here in  Ireland , aghast at the whole gun issue and in disbelief that you can pick up a rifle with your weekly shop in any supermarket chain.

1072 2018-03-01 19:34:32 He did read. That uranium isn't weapons grade and can't be exported. Russia has deep uranium stocks and can make their own nuclear devices regardless.
1073 2018-03-01 19:34:31 Probably, but this was necessary move for steel industry/its workers. Should also prop up Coal & Iron Ore since they're so connected to Steel. One of my fav stocks to trade is AK Steel(AKS) fr Oh. They've got 2.6 Beta & it moves a lot.
Trade it 4-5 times/yr on avg w/strong % Ret.

1166 2018-03-01 19:30:58 TRUMP JUST BETRAYED US GUN OWNERS !!! Attacked our bump stocks, 50 STATE CCW, ECT. Do you even want me to vote for you in 2020 ? This is not how to do it

1168 2018-03-01 19:30:33 About 50% of Americans have no stock
 What % do you believe even have a 401k? 
According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, only 32% of Americans are saving for retirement in a 401(k). 
Add in huge investors and approx 50% total have stocks.

1177 2018-03-01 19:29:35 Stocks plunge after Trump announces coming Tariffs.

Nobody can say he didn't forewarn us.


(Looking for shocked faces?)
1178 2018-03-01 19:29:27 Hey donnie, another stellar day at the stock market. If I keep winning like this, it'll be an extra decade before i retire. Worst month for stocks in over 2 years and continuing today. Why so silent all of the sudden?
1179 2018-03-01 19:29:19 After this administration if I ever hear the word "Portfolio" again to discuss something other than stocks or an art project i'm gonna be sick.

Jared's ridiculous "Portfolio" should have been stopped by Congress AGES AGO @SpeakerRyan .
1180 2018-03-01 19:29:14 Retweeted Laurence Tribe (@tribelaw):

No guns till age 21, no bump stocks, ban AR-15s & equivalent guns, ban multi-shot clips, ban body-shredding ammo, make background checks & registration universal, use red flags & restraining orders, no guns for those on no fly list, boy…

1182 2018-03-01 19:29:08 You just caused stocks to drop because everyone’s anticipating a trade war thanks to your idiotic tariffs. #unfit #IdiotInChief

1185 2018-03-01 19:28:46 consumer stocks going down ie v/ma is just stupid...ask a millenial...people are willing to pay more for made in usa or healthy food etc    there are so many examples of this...as pg about them paying more for smaller brands that give back or are all natural etc
1186 2018-03-01 19:28:23 Yeah if the bulk of your portfolio is short penny stocks and btc
1187 2018-03-01 19:28:20 POTUS announcement on steel and aluminum taxes having negative impact on stocks.
1188 2018-03-01 19:28:17 Youre scaring wall street....stocks taking a dive
1189 2018-03-01 19:28:10 Check out they’re twitter acct. @Amerresources I expect them to communicate to shareholders soon.
1190 2018-03-01 19:28:09 U.S. stocks plunge after Trump announces steel tariffs; Dow down 500 points in mid-afternoon trading -- Fox News
1191 2018-03-01 19:28:06 im in ARS so all good.however not nice seeing all these high street names in trouble. toys r us,  maplin, prezzo plus more. #WPP dropped today due to lower advertising revenues which can b a sign things are starting to look a bit shakey. Americas stocks goin down again.. thoughts
1192 2018-03-01 19:27:53 If you don’t take advantage this Tariff  fear and don’t buy the dip on stocks today, you’re a donkey or a sheep  
1193 2018-03-01 19:27:49 Trumps protectionism triggers  stocks plunge. S&P, Dow off more than 2% - market fears of trade war as Trump is all set to impose tarrifs on steel & aluminium imports. High Tariffs can increase prices for American consumers #DowJones
1194 2018-03-01 19:27:44 More useless regulations that have already been implemented in our schools. Where is the ban on assault weapons, bump stocks and gun shows? Where is the age increase to 21? This is a band-aide on a wide open wound that needs to be sown up. #NeverAgain #NoMore
1195 2018-03-01 19:27:35 Stocks now down 500+ over tariffs
1196 2018-03-01 19:27:31 #stocks
1197 2018-03-01 19:27:14 Its interesting to watch Neo cons freak out over 500 points when 2 weeks ago they were defending 2000 points lost as a market correction. The losses today are also a market correction of people pulling money from stocks that will lose from this.
1198 2018-03-01 19:26:55 AINT NOBODY GIVING YOU STOCKS UNLESS YOU WIFEYYYYYYY LMAO
1199 2018-03-01 19:26:47 this drop people is just Great  I am happy it  is going to make things easier in the right stocks on confirmation to make great gains. their was a reason I exited 95% of my positions that were in options with great profits to catch more gains once things became more clear.
1200 2018-03-01 19:26:16 Due process is important. I don't want the semi automatics and bump stocks etc either, but we have checks and balances for a reason. Right?

1203 2018-03-01 19:25:18 So what are the odd the Trump businesses shorted international steel and aluminum companies over the last few days? And bought stocks in the US ones?
1204 2018-03-01 19:25:10 "Trump announces tariffs on steel, aluminum imports, sends stocks plunging"
1205 2018-03-01 19:24:52 It's not just a ban on bump stocks. It's would be a ban on all fire rate modding devices. Like lighter triggers, grips etc... Hell even just semi auto could be under that umbrella. And do we forget when we give the left an inch they take a mile.

1207 2018-03-01 19:24:40 You lied about making America great again?  You did not do your homework and you have third grade level mentality. You are not qualified to run the country. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS do us favor? RESIGN NOW!  Stocks are falling based on your stupidity @cnn @nytimes #NotMyPresident
1208 2018-03-01 19:23:44 @NYSE @realDonaldTrump  This is just showing me that a lot of people have stocks in China steel so they’re selling them because  The president is going to cut trade with them to a percentage go figure Americans in bed with China With stock
1209 2018-03-01 19:23:42 And now its down again. Stocks are not magic, dude.

1211 2018-03-01 19:23:39 I think of it Stephen as a professional position and use it as a time to greatly reduce ACB in quality long term holds, including with dividend stocks. It is of course a great deal easier to look back after the fall then on the day.

1214 2018-03-01 19:23:00 That is an indisputable fact. 

The other fact is it was an AR-15 that allowed so many lives lost in a mere 6 minutes. 

Similarly the Las Vegas shooter had guns with Bump Stocks allowing him to take out many targets in a very short period of time. 

I am a gun owner too
1215 2018-03-01 19:22:57 Stocks tanked 500 points!!!
1216 2018-03-01 19:22:27 Stocks are down, #BTC is up. Life is good. 

Being uncorrelated to the stock market is such a huge play for funds to get in and mitigate their risk even more. Even if its 2% of the total portfolio
1217 2018-03-01 19:22:01 #Nickel settled firmly in red despite a 3% decline in #LME on-warrant stocks, taking total on-warrant inventory back to Oct 2016 levels.  T’over solid across #base complex, notably #zinc that saw 17k lots trade by 17:30, +87% on the 20-day average.

1220 2018-03-01 19:21:44 A little more than 50% of Americans own stocks, while the wealthiest 10% own over 80% of all stocks. It's not hard to see who benefits most.
1221 2018-03-01 19:21:14 Where did you source this graph from, Breitbart or Fox? Youve no idea how the stock market works, eh? You own any stocks? Have a 401K?

1224 2018-03-01 19:20:41 I own zero stocks, but I keep up my investing cred by talking about how I predicted some obscure pharmacy company's meteoric rise back in middle school. Just found out that company no longer exists... since 2011. #WallStreet
1225 2018-03-01 19:20:29 Cheap stocks!
1226 2018-03-01 19:20:27 You show up and give businesses and billionaires a HUGE tax cut that fills their already overflowing bank accounts but barely helps the 98% of the rest of the country.  Then they're buying back their stocks and pocketing even more.  Wages?  Flat as a board.  Douche.
1227 2018-03-01 19:20:04 On the @FoxNews homepage, the headline is "Trump announces tariffs on steel, aluminum imports, sends stocks soaring” but the actual headline correctly says “plunging,” not “soaring.” Typo or misdirection?
1228 2018-03-01 19:20:01 Looks like stocks just went on sale  with tariff announcement!  I’m not all about timing the market necessarily but I have spare cash and think it’s time to dump it in the market.
1229 2018-03-01 19:20:01 Especially auto stocks
1230 2018-03-01 19:19:59 My #stocks are down 3% today because #FragileDonnie wants to punish Canadian steel.

1232 2018-03-01 19:19:52 glad to see that the stock market loves your Tariffs idea...oh wait sorry the phone was upside down...yeah you might need to rethink placing your future in stocks...or issuing tariffs - seems it needs to be one or the other

1234 2018-03-01 19:19:25 @garyvee what’s the best way for me to invest my money! I’m thinking stocks are the best? Any advice
1235 2018-03-01 19:19:22 Stocks plunge - S&P, Dow off more than 2% - on fears of a trade war after President says he'll impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum. Tariffs can be considered a tax on American consumers
1236 2018-03-01 19:19:14 #ThursdaysThoughts #stocks U.S. steel and aluminum manufacturers have been losing steadily since the 1950s. Go to Pennsylvania and see for yourself.  Mismanagement, uncompetitive pricing and labor practices, and often a lack of quality in the product itself.
1237 2018-03-01 19:19:10 US stocks plunge as trump starts trade wars.
1238 2018-03-01 19:18:58 Market getting better #Lithium
Stocks have been steady today....
Hold tight..Good days are coming..
1239 2018-03-01 19:18:57 Would the concurrent drop in bond yield help stocks recover faster?
1240 2018-03-01 19:18:44 Bump stocks & age limits are a start but let’s really piss off gun nuts like  @MeganSmiles @donkeyarguing & #BanAssaultWeapons
1241 2018-03-01 19:18:43 Weird day in US. Dow spiralling down, yet 10 yr treasuries plummeted from 2.88% to 2.80% currently, never seen a fall like that, which should be shoring stocks up? And gold down.
1242 2018-03-01 19:18:41 Stocks can't stand the sight of blood[y protectionism].

1245 2018-03-01 19:18:21 No, we do not want to take your guns.  We want universal background checks, a national data base, gun owners registered & insured.

1254 2018-03-01 19:17:32 OK - shortcomings as in: Selling assault/auto-weapons to ANYONE; Banning those said weapons; banning bump stocks; deep vetting background checks incl. gun shows & private sales; age limits.  What current law $ policies?  We know where you stand.  $$$/NRA
1255 2018-03-01 19:17:31 Stocks plunge again after Trump woke up this morning. The economy is doomed, America is suffering. For more than 13 months people fear his next hairbrained idea.

1260 2018-03-01 19:16:46 That a slow kind US stocks sell-off.
No nasty flash-crashes for now.
1261 2018-03-01 19:16:46 Remember when I said "fear Trump on stocks" because he was threatening a trade war? Then he got into office and broke all his promises. I breathed a sigh of relief. 

Oops...he started a trade war today. Hold onto you hats.
1262 2018-03-01 19:16:45 Most semi-automatic rifles or pistols cannot fire that rapidly either. The Vegas shooter has to modify them with “bump stocks” to simulate automatic fire. I think even Trump wants to ban bump stocks.
1263 2018-03-01 19:16:29 Yahoo informs me that "Stocks Rally as Fed's Powell Testifies..." but VIX is up 20% and the S&P is down 50pts.
1264 2018-03-01 19:15:58 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan nice going dear little pathetic leader stocks pushing a 600 point drop because of you no wonder Wall Street calls you D.A. Donnie

1272 2018-03-01 19:14:43 Stocks are tanking, as was entirely predictable.
1273 2018-03-01 19:14:41 I’d rather talk about making bump stocks illegal in Texas and controlling and regulating assault weapons. I’d rather see you stop pimping for the @NRA and start representing Texas.
1274 2018-03-01 19:14:31 @AntTheBull there cost basis being over a dollar or more on penny stocks. Holding can get you burnt. Would rather take a calculated risk
1275 2018-03-01 19:14:27 Any idea of how many shares are really at 2.00?
1276 2018-03-01 19:14:17 any decent trader should be up at least 500% in the past month over all of last years gains,  stocks crawl up but collapse pretty fast.  & we arent even in a bear market yet

1283 2018-03-01 19:12:00 @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr   this Republican sold all stocks in response to tariff threat.  House and Senate should strip President’s power to impose tariffs.

1287 2018-03-01 19:11:35 Time to open an SEC investigation into insider trading.  Who know what and when.  Steel company stocks rose heavily today after this announcement.

1289 2018-03-01 19:11:24 Just received an "emergency" phone call from #NRA asking me for $$ to fight against those who want to shut down the NRA.

1290 2018-03-01 19:11:21 @realDonaldTrump Ban bump stocks not rifles! Any rifle ban gets passed you will lose my vote next election. All my donations will stop to your campaign.
1291 2018-03-01 19:11:06 $once, weed stocks and pet stocks green. Fuck tariffs
1292 2018-03-01 19:11:02 Bump stocks and the high powered guns weren’t around when the 2nd amendment went into effect.

1301 2018-03-01 19:09:34 Perdiendo todo lo ganado estos días..¿Pero no estaba el mercado sano?

1311 2018-03-01 19:07:38 After hearing what he said over the last couple of days, I'm starting 2? That. Remember CA dems started w Attachments like a front grip, adjustable stocks, 30rdmags. Bumpstock by EO, even after ATF ruled it ok, Which used in Vegas, but Not a word on Gat devices. BOWING 2dems? Why
1312 2018-03-01 19:07:29 Will this not bring jobs back to U.S. for steel workers? Most average American's don't own stocks & cld care less about stock market falling, but we do care about JOBS that will put $ in our pocket rather than on Wall Street.
1313 2018-03-01 19:07:29 Dow now down more then 500 points and more then 2%. #stocks #Dow #DowJones #Index #investment #Finance

1316 2018-03-01 19:06:42 We still don't think Trump has signed the order banning bump stocks. Stop announcing it and just do it...

Should have been done straight after Vegas...

#NeverAgainMSD
1317 2018-03-01 19:06:42 Bump stocks? Red flag legislation? Age limits? Other devises that legally turn semi automatic guns into fully automatic. Back ground checks for any gun sale? Negligence of gun storage? Buying guns for others?  These are all things we need to talk about. I don’t care about AR 15
1318 2018-03-01 19:06:31 We already have two out of four, and if @BarackObama and the democrats didn’t get bump stocks legal, that wouldn’t be a problem... the age thing should be up to parents. My kids owned at six years old
1319 2018-03-01 19:06:20 I have a strange feeling that money could be coming to crypto. Tell everyone it’s “risky” for a while and then flood the crypto space. At the same time telling people that the stock market is only having a “healthy correction” to keep people from selling their boring stocks
1320 2018-03-01 19:06:17 I don’t suppport your executive order to ban bump stocks.  Citizens may need fire power in the future. What if hitlery regains power?  Citizens need to stay armed and ready to fight tyranny.  You don’t know what weaponery our children’s children may need to stop tyranny
1321 2018-03-01 19:05:54 DOW stocks down over $540 today, huge drop after Trump announced tariffs on Canadian steel.

1330 2018-03-01 19:04:04 Wow, market selling off hard. Valuations look good in here. Sit tight while the scared flee. #Fed scares stocks.
1331 2018-03-01 19:03:54 No president needed to authorize them. Law provides the definition of a machine gun as being more than one shot per pull of the trigger. Bump stocks don't make a gun fire multiple shots per pull of the trigger. Therefor, they do not legally count as machineguns.
1332 2018-03-01 19:03:47 I accept these facts: I'm not gonna buy the bottom. I'm not gonna sell the top.   Acceptance clears our head and let's us approach objectively.  #stocks #investing
1333 2018-03-01 19:03:34 But bump stocks were only mentioned in 1 incidence and the AR-15 is not an assault rifle, it's semiautomatic. So what's your point?
1334 2018-03-01 19:03:33 Stocks starting to blow through short term MAs, programs should start kicking in with earnest.

1342 2018-03-01 19:02:08 I don’t support your upcoming executive order to ban bump stocks.  I don’t support your continued presence in Syria.   Everything else is so awsome. But those things. Don’t do them.

1353 2018-03-01 19:00:16 Sure unregulate banks...ignore guns.  Tone deaf McConnell shows who has bought his loyalty...bank stocks and gun barrels.

Back to resource stocks.
1355 2018-03-01 18:59:57 Well, the thing is you cant just spit out endless picks without making room for the new ones by selling old ones. Also a percent allocation is necessary.  It's tough.  I do a 5% portfolio allocation with a maximum of 20 stocks, no margin and no penny stocks. Double the S&P, net.
1356 2018-03-01 18:59:46 This guy doesn't give a damn about anything but the price of stocks! He's shown that for years!
If you're not a Globalist, you know that the other countries actually dictate what our reaction should be!
1357 2018-03-01 18:59:45 Stocks dropped 450 points right after his announcement.
1358 2018-03-01 18:59:39 @NYSEMACDesk Is margin safer to use for trading futures rather than purchasing stocks at ask prices and trading for expected returns? I’m interested if marginal trades will result in less risk, with the same expected returns when applied to futures. Thank you!
1359 2018-03-01 18:58:55 Dow down 400 after his announcement.  Steel stocks up.  Who are the real winners here?
1360 2018-03-01 18:58:46 Any information on stocks and shares isa ??
1361 2018-03-01 18:58:35 Tariffs are hardly what we need now in this current environment. Rates rising, higher prices = higher inflation, Market out of whack and in need of a correction. And that's without Mueller bringing the heat on the White House. That's a lot of stuff. Stocks tanking Genius! 
1362 2018-03-01 18:58:31 Except for steel and aluminum stocks which had already run up in advance of the announcement and now get a bigger bounce this afternoon
1363 2018-03-01 18:58:26 @realDonaldTrump Seriously, WTH is going on with taking gun without due process and bump stocks. Just another act in the big deception of the American people?

1375 2018-03-01 18:57:00 Background checks already exist, individuals with felony convictions can't buy weapons.  I'm afraid you'll need to be a little more specific.  Do away with bump stocks?  Sure. But age restrictions are increasing gun free zones without calling them that.

1437 2018-03-01 18:42:50 "I never would have guessed that passive index flows could create this kind of unnatural disparity across every major equity index! The five largest stocks in each index dwarfed everything else."

The disparity between index members  has to be the result of active management.
1438 2018-03-01 18:42:46 UPDATE: Stocks fall near session lows as investors react to threat of steel, aluminum tariffs
Today 1:32 PM ET (MarketWatch)
1439 2018-03-01 18:42:20 I am fine with sensible boundaries Lynn, 21 yr age limit, no bump stocks, background checks, mandatory safety training, and mental health checks. I do not agree with a ban on semi automatic weapons. Could be swayed on high capacity magazines.

1441 2018-03-01 18:42:06 United Steel (X) is up 7%. Cleveland Metals and Mining (CLF) up 10%. Market <> steel/metal stocks <> economy.
1442 2018-03-01 18:41:37 Temporary as domestic stocks will grow.
1443 2018-03-01 18:41:35 Either the transmitter has fallen off or it’s been blasted from the sky by some shithead who’s thinks they are preserving Grouse stocks,  we all know the answer.  Extremely difficult to prosecute and they know it! #Grouse
1444 2018-03-01 18:41:35 And if trillions are re-patriated while trillions go to the sidelines because nobody wants bonds, at the same time stocks are falling... what's  a fella to do?
1445 2018-03-01 18:41:27 DOW sinks 317 points. "Stocks are near their lows of the day as the DJIA loses 1.27%. Despite the weakness in the broad market, breadth is about even on the New York Stock Exchange, implying that much of today's loss is concentrated to the larger cap names." Market Watch
1446 2018-03-01 18:41:21 Besides sale: baby stocks, never worn.
1447 2018-03-01 18:41:02 I just noticed that the great one has lost 1500!

- understanding grain marketing futures reference months & delivery months

1463 2018-03-01 18:37:24 Ban assault rifles.
Ban high capacity magazines.
Ban bump stocks.

1466 2018-03-01 18:36:37 A nice day to buy stone stocks @stockpile .  Nice prices today
1467 2018-03-01 18:35:58 You guys know that people on the Federal No-Fly list can still buy guns right? They can also still buy bump-stocks and AR-15s. You know this right? Tell me you know this Like come on @NRA. This is irrational. You cant even make a sound argument in favor of our current policy #sad

1469 2018-03-01 18:35:36 I just ordered a few bump stocks. Now I have more bump stocks than I do AR's. Why? Just because I can.
1470 2018-03-01 18:35:27 #stocks#ThursdayThoughts    Watch Asian steel producers soon throw down their gauntlets in retaliation against Trump's depressing protectionism. We don't need a president who becomes another Benjamin Haririson and William McKinley.

1472 2018-03-01 18:35:11 Lmao Kroger sold assault rifles? Okay. I feel like all these random stores are gonna announce the same thing. “Oh haven’t you heard? Yeah Michael’s has stopped selling assault rifles. Yeah good for them. No, Hobby Lobby still carries bump stocks.”
1473 2018-03-01 18:34:46 Putain j'ai bien fait de le chopper 10e moins cher en début de semaine. Ça vide les stocks !
1474 2018-03-01 18:34:29 Agreed. Although- Is it possible that the capital flow from the sell off in Stocks right now could just go right into Crypto, precluding the correction?  This could be a real possibility right now.
1475 2018-03-01 18:34:09 not for long...if people want to give away their stocks all I can say is —thanks

1479 2018-03-01 18:32:54 U are partially on the right track. But there is no need to arm teachers.  I'm sure U heard about the teacher firing his gun in school yesterday? You can "respect the 2nd Amendment" while still banning bump stocks, high capacity magazines & anything resembling an assault weapon.
1480 2018-03-01 18:32:46 For real though I’ve never seen trump as a champion for the 2nd amendment but he’s absolutely good for it. And even if he bans stupid bump stocks (which would be unacceptable and pointless) he’s not some traitor.
1481 2018-03-01 18:32:32 We cannot jus hope. Congress must act!  Ban assault weapons, bump stocks. Expand background checks and close internetband gun show loopholes!  Make America Safe Again!  In school, at church, in a nightclub, at a concert!
1482 2018-03-01 18:32:15 Three years ago before ARs and bump stocks were popular 
1483 2018-03-01 18:32:08 what's the difference between these bump stocks and a pistol with a 32 round mag? not very much if any, while your at it go for pistols with large number magazines

1490 2018-03-01 18:30:04 I was happy with openness to the Democrats. It was nice to see that you will ban bump stocks and talk of gun control. That is a big deal.

1493 2018-03-01 18:29:39 The great thing about this is every age limitation, every chain that stops carrying weapons or magazines hurts the industry, their stocks fall and their profits are affected. A win win, one step at a time
1494 2018-03-01 18:29:23 Yeah. Is it the guns? Or is it the people? It’s the people. 
I think it’s fair to discuss magazine capacities, ban bump stocks and any number of other related topics but people treat AR-15s as though they are themselves terrible when they’re just not.
1495 2018-03-01 18:29:21 Common features of AR-15 & M-16:          Both chambered for .223 rounds.             Both can achieve full auto with mods including bump stocks.
Both have same look, feel, action, results.
Only difference, one sanctioned to kill in war, other a hunting rifle?
1496 2018-03-01 18:29:16 Banning bump stocks is a start, but not the end. Assault rifles themselves have to go. You can easily create bump fire without the use of a stock.
1497 2018-03-01 18:29:15 Oh weed stocks are running? Wow!

1498 2018-03-01 18:29:14 Give it a month or so, American steel manufacturers stocks will soar!
1499 2018-03-01 18:29:13 It is fair to say that the market does not love tariffs (stocks down >1%). It will be interesting to see if this creates political feedback loop. #tariffs

1501 2018-03-01 18:29:05 He didn’t. Infact he bought more around 30p trying to average down. Hopefully it’s bounce a little tomorrow and he can get out. Told him to focus on stocks with more potential but never did. Learned the hard way 
1502 2018-03-01 18:28:30 Trillion dollar question: #BabyBoomerRetirees hold fast in stocks or suddenly realize threat to  retirement and sell in historic stampede?
1503 2018-03-01 18:28:21 Are you a republican or just plain stupid , because of Trump's policy on China imports and other policies he's in acting we are headed for another recession ... Remember , invest in gold not stocks unless you want to lose your ass .

1511 2018-03-01 18:27:05 Limit magazine size!  Outlaw bump stocks!
1512 2018-03-01 18:26:53 Hey @cvpayne March is typically a strong month for stocks with the S&P 500 Index gaining an average of 1.2% over the past 50 years.  Rough start to March.  I think we test the lows of last month; what say you @HeatherZuma @davidnelsoncfa?
1513 2018-03-01 18:26:50 You don’t know that bump stocks are useless do you. Your silly gun laws will get people killed. Congrats.
1514 2018-03-01 18:26:46 i literally won with two stocks @nyretry
1515 2018-03-01 18:26:45 go look at the stocks in the auto complex
1516 2018-03-01 18:26:35 That is, if you want to ban stuff, why not ban stuff that actually increases a firearm's lethality, like many round magazines (at least outside of gun ranges), bump fire stocks, other approximations of full auto, etc.
1517 2018-03-01 18:26:12 By the way people last time stocks took a shit we started to run then crashed hard be careful 
1518 2018-03-01 18:26:07 have to admit, I missed the runup in defense stocks after Trump's election, and didn't think of them during the recent pullback. (Did load up on tech, though).

1524 2018-03-01 18:24:29 Obama's ATF said that bump stocks cant be banned without a new law from Congress. Trump took out his pen and phone and ordered Sessions to ban bump stocks with no new law from Congress. You OK with that?

1532 2018-03-01 18:23:16 You just tanked the stock market with your tariff announcement. Those who own steel or aluminum stocks are in good shape. Everyone else in the market is screwed. If you're so concerned about manufacturing and trade, why don't you start with manufacturing your own products here.
1533 2018-03-01 18:22:45 You can empty a 30-round magazine with an AR-15 in less than 15 seconds just pulling the trigger as fast as you can. Banning bump stocks isn't going to make any one safer.

1552 2018-03-01 18:19:39 .@JohnKasich proposed gun reforms: Keeping firearms from potentially dangerous people and domestic abusers, closing background check systems gaps, strengthening prohibitions on “straw man” purchases, banning armor-piercing ammo and banning bump stocks.
1553 2018-03-01 18:19:36 And yet bump stocks and assault weapons are still legal in Indiana.  Talk about legislating for the smallest problem that affects the fewest people...

1568 2018-03-01 18:16:37 I urge you to stop processing payments for sales of assault style weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, and other military style weapons.

1569 2018-03-01 18:16:37 There’s “cheap relative to” and just “cheap”. Very few “cheap” stocks out there right now at any cap.
1570 2018-03-01 18:16:07 @realDonaldTrump i really hope you do everything to keep stocks up...that is your base...you can not lose the market and survive midterms and have any chance to win reelection.
1571 2018-03-01 18:15:14 Just a note for those who support Trump's economic policies, when he says the stock market and shareholders are doing great, he's talking about the top wealthiest 10% or the people who hold 84% of all stocks. Not you.

Then there's the nuts that think bump stocks are fine, even in the hands of teenagers with AR's? Call me crazy, but @realDonaldTrump uses common sense...

1618 2018-03-01 18:03:26 Banning bump stocks is OK with me as it essentially takes a semi-automatic weapon and turns it automatic.
1619 2018-03-01 18:02:45 I think this is in order coz  saw millers with huge stocks cannot even move their sales, they have huge loans to pay, the moratorium is on logging not sawmilling what they have already stocked

1636 2018-03-01 17:57:56 All I know is that AR-15 shoots the same .223 rounds that you can shoot out of M-16 rifle and as fast as you can pull the trigger and possibly full auto using bump stocks and other manipulations.
1637 2018-03-01 17:57:33 In the interest of spirited debate, I would say that a pure, unhedged trend following approach into election is extremely dangerous.

Your recent positions on this gun ban and age limit has just cost you another vote come your re-election. Bump stocks are one thing, but banning a style of firearm or upping the age has just cost you another vote. Independent next it seems.
1688 2018-03-01 17:43:01 Are you taking about bump stocks ?

1690 2018-03-01 17:42:40 There is no respecting of the second amendment if you ban assault weapons and raise minimum age. What the hell does bump stocks have to do with what happened at Parkland? If you cave; we have no issue with voting you out.

1705 2018-03-01 17:40:02 @ReformedBroker @terranovajoe @jlebenthal @HalftimeReport With Trump's announcement of new tariffs coming the steel stocks are rising as most sectors are tanking. I'll be buying $HD at $181. What will you be buying as a result of this news? Thanks.
1706 2018-03-01 17:39:59 MUST HAVE. MEETING SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT SCHOOL SECURITY HOW TO PROTECT THE KIDS NOT BUMP STOCKS, AGE TO PURCHASE A FIREARM, NOT ABOUT WHAT KIND OF GUN WE CAN BUY PERIOD.
1707 2018-03-01 17:39:47 So if one teacher starts shooting at the shooter (who is an adult) then the shooter starts shooting at the teacher then a 2nd teacher walks into the room. How will the 2nd teacher know who is the shooter and who is the teacher? There are so many holes in Trumps arm teacher plan
1708 2018-03-01 17:39:40 BREAKING: Old Navy will no longer sell assault rifles or bump stocks.
1709 2018-03-01 17:39:26 Of course it would be better for whole economy but for how long? Most people and investment firms buying stocks now are short time holders. Everyone seems to be holding their breath waiting for the next REAL market correction or even crash.
1710 2018-03-01 17:39:07 What kind of accounts are you looking for, more stocks, or ETFs or Mutual fund type assets? Watch your maintenance fees. I  moved some to a vanguard account recently because of their low overhead fees.

1714 2018-03-01 17:38:30 I agree we need to address safety, especially in schools but more gun control is not the answer.  Background checks are necessary but the issue is lack of reporting. Banning bump stocks and semi automatics won't help. Armed teachers/guards in school and cc reciprocity will help.
1715 2018-03-01 17:38:09 #trade #war fear is being reflected on the market today.

1716 2018-03-01 17:37:44 Let’s not forget, even if the gun nuts are desperate enough to “give us” bum stocks... it’s about all semi-automatics. There is no reason for civilians to have them. Period. All they are good for is killing multiple people.

1718 2018-03-01 17:37:10 Again, what happens to stocks when USTs go to zero? Are all banks insolvent? Pls answer. They do hold capital in USTs right?
1719 2018-03-01 17:37:07 EOs are not supposed to make or change laws. You should be against Trump wanting to write an EO banning bunk stocks, it sets a bad precedent. The next president can expand on what is banned. Just saying

1723 2018-03-01 17:36:19 Bump stocks are only ONE type of after market device to make a semi-automatic into an automatic, and FUTURE devices would skirt a "Bump Stock" bill. It has to blanket the entire array of devices or it's worthless. All semi-autos need to be banned. 3rd degree felony for having one
1724 2018-03-01 17:36:09 That wasn't disputed. What was listed were incidences in which bump stocks were not used. Therefore banning them wouldn't have made a difference. Reading comprehension.
1725 2018-03-01 17:36:04 Bump stocks are one thing, make the ban encompass ALL DEVICES based on ROUNDS PER SECOND

There are more brands of weapons than the AR-15. Ban, or restrict to shooting ranges, all those not for hunting.

No large clips. Make the mass murderer reload. Is that too much to ask?

1744 2018-03-01 17:30:09 We can do more:
—Requiring universal background checks on all gun sales.
—Banning semi-automatic weapons, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks.
—Requiring thorough training and permitting for all gun purchases.
—Creating a system to track and limit the purchase of ammunition.
1745 2018-03-01 17:29:59 I'd add closing gun show loophole and banning *any* mechanism enabling rapid fire (not just bump stocks). Mental health care needs to be a priority again as well. -- for the record, I am pro 2nd Amendment and I have zero problems with any of these common sense restrictions.
1746 2018-03-01 17:29:56 @CarterFletcher what’re your thought on the stocks these days?
1747 2018-03-01 17:29:38 The only way you're shooting 400 rounds a minute with an AR-15 is with happy thoughts and pixie dust. Automatic guns should be banned and are. Bump stocks should be banned and are in the process of being banned. However, any dipshit with a 3D printer can make their own.

1771 2018-03-01 17:22:03 A ban on bump stocks does absolutely nothing to prevent a law abiding gun owner from defending themselves. This is common sense... Long overdue common sense. The more of it the better

1818 2018-03-01 17:09:37 Amazon a encore des stocks des fois.
1819 2018-03-01 17:09:27 Sorry, bud. You're wrong, plain & simple. Bump stocks increase rates of fire on military-grade rifles...for what purpose? By your own words, for no good purpose, other than allowing civilian yahoos to feel like special ops. So get rid of them.
1820 2018-03-01 17:09:01 Ich find das jedenfalls sonst nirgends. Das einzige, für das er einen "ban" will, sind "bump stocks".

Ein kompletter Bann von Sturmgewehren wäre geradezu revolutionär.

1822 2018-03-01 17:08:02 @realDonaldTrump Mr President I’m a proud member of the NRA and a strong Trump Supporter. I must say I disagree with these approach you have taken on these gun laws. Raising the age and bump stocks won’t have any effect on mass shootings. Just effect law biding citizens.
1823 2018-03-01 17:07:55 Stocks and bonds doing little now. FX rather stuck
1824 2018-03-01 17:07:46 POTUS: Lets change the narrative a bit. Ban the government from using bump stocks, body armor, assault rifles, & high capacity magazines from use against citizens. Then citizens would not need them and then you could ban those from citizens. Also, ban the use of them by criminals
1825 2018-03-01 17:07:19 There's a great bookstore in Braamfontein that stocks only local books.

1827 2018-03-01 17:06:06 A pretty small fraction of pension funding comes from actual workers. The vast majority of it comes from taxpayers and investment returns. You don't get a 50K annual pension *for life* by throwing 5% of your salary into stocks.

1829 2018-03-01 17:05:32 I applaud for Washington state Legislature gave final approval to a state ban on bump stocks. Governor Inslee urged the Legislature last week to place restrictions on sale of semi-automatic, military style rifles. Thank you Governor Inslee!!
1830 2018-03-01 17:05:22 Makes sense. The package is definitely what teams would want. Defending several positions, passing, shooting, energy, career ~6.0 stocks%. Would fit what LA would want on the wing, as much as I'd like a playmaker type with the Cleveland pick.
1831 2018-03-01 17:05:18 $2 up are there hardly any shares on this thing?
1832 2018-03-01 17:05:09 Would that mean that natural gas stocks (cdn) should be going up? If storage is between the range you stated?
1833 2018-03-01 17:05:01  Make background checks 100% universal - Close the private sale loopholes 
 Ban assault style weapons  
 Ban bump stocks and other trigger accelerators 
 Raise the minimum age to purchase any semi-automatic firearm
1834 2018-03-01 17:05:00 No guns till age 21, no bump stocks, ban AR-15s & equivalent guns, ban multi-shot clips, ban body-shredding ammo, make background checks & registration universal, use red flags & restraining orders, no guns for those on no fly list, boycott NRA, vote out its puppets.

1841 2018-03-01 17:03:27 1. Every FFL dealer & vast majority of retailers do Federal background checks. 
2. Since NO gun manufacturer ever designed, built or sold an “assault weapon” & you keep changing its definition, what kind of guns are u talking about? 
3. Bump stocks are easily made.
1842 2018-03-01 17:03:17 Yes Hun, you do.
1843 2018-03-01 17:03:04 I hope trump does not outlaw bump stocks.   I am developing a fleshlight attached to a bump stock device.  Bigly sales ahead!

1847 2018-03-01 17:01:28 "Trump weighs steel and aluminum tariffs, sends stocks soaring"
1848 2018-03-01 17:01:20 Don't ban bump stocks: Ban any technology that makes a semi-auto effectively auto. There are more ways to do this than just bump stocks.
1849 2018-03-01 17:00:55 If Obama had done like NRA said Vegas would not have taken place but CNN would never say it. Trump is writing out bump stocks as machine guns!!!!

1853 2018-03-01 16:59:52 So if I buy $1,000,300 and short $300 of gun stocks I should be morally fine? 
1854 2018-03-01 16:59:31 The NRA and legal gun owners supported Banning bump stocks before the shooting ever occurred. I still think you should change your name.

1856 2018-03-01 16:59:13 Actually Obama allowed the Bump Stocks after the NRA said that it should be handled like an full auto - machine gun. But don't worry Trump is going to treat it as a machine gun! Trump has been fixing all of Obama's screw ups!

1862 2018-03-01 16:57:25 Good on Trump for advocating  eliminating bump stocks, raising the age of eligibility to buy long guns, and tightening background checks. Good on Walmart, Dicks, and other outlets for restrictions on sales of AR-15s. Shame on FedEx and Amazon for continuing to support the NRA.
1863 2018-03-01 16:57:11 waster of time and data - this will do nothing - how many mass shootings involve bump stocks, and they can be improvised easy enough. just an attempt to shut down the outrage. Ban High Capacity magazines and Semi Auto hi powered rifles.
1864 2018-03-01 16:57:11 why not look for stocks with solid balance sheet and revenue from foreign income?
staying in cash during accelerating inflation seems to be the worst thing..You're holding the primary thing that's losing value

1870 2018-03-01 16:54:18 Action on gun violence is not a political question — it’s about keeping Americans safe. Here’s what we need to do to start addressing this epidemic:

 Make background checks universal 
 Ban assault weapons 
 Ban bump stocks
 Raise the minimum age to purchase rifles
1871 2018-03-01 16:54:15 I thought we all established the fact that you never truly did tax reform... you gave massive tax cuts to corporations (mostly used to buy back stocks) which are permanent, TaxCuts that help the wealthiest Americans most and a dabble to the rest which btw expire. This is taxscam
1872 2018-03-01 16:54:10 You guys are idiots. No one is repealing the 2nd amendment, there’s no same reason why an ordinary citizen needs a semiautomatic or automatic rifle other than to shoot human targets ban bump stocks increase the age limit to 21 to buy a gun
1873 2018-03-01 16:54:02 Don't fall for Trump's promise for an Executive Order on bump stocks. I'm guessing that strategy was agreed upon in his weekend mtg with NRA.
1874 2018-03-01 16:53:36 Gutted to have had to postpone my @GiveBloodNHS appointment tonight because I’ve been sick for the last week. Blood stocks run low in weather like this so please please please give blood over the next couple of weeks if you can!

1887 2018-03-01 16:51:04 I know. It was an example. Funds also don't buy the exact ratio of stocks in an index, but I was trying to explain it to him simply. And of course a fund could own 10% of a company within an index. If a fund is really big, then why not?
1888 2018-03-01 16:50:51 What do you think about Trump's ideas to keep guns away from mentally ill people, people with criminal records and to ban bump stocks?
1889 2018-03-01 16:50:32 It's a loophole to get around ATF regulations. You know it, they know it. Just like positive reset trigger systems, bump stocks, and "private sellers" at gun shows.
1890 2018-03-01 16:50:27 Just a little too much on the band list there. Bump stocks, AR15’s, high-capacity magazines are not the problem. Keeping guns out of the hands of nut jobs is where all of our energies need to be focused.

1896 2018-03-01 16:47:56 Such a cynical approach to governance. He won't ban bump stocks because he believes in it. Or because it's the right thing to do. He'll do it because it gets HIM something that HE wants more. This is what happens when an unscrupulous businessman applies his approach to government
1897 2018-03-01 16:47:34 I dont want semi auto to go away (Don't want mine taken away). I think people need mandatory training and extensive BG checks though. And get rid of the damn bump stocks IMO.

I'm a gun owner. There's no doubt in my mind that we should:

1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks
1905 2018-03-01 16:45:13 That’s nice of you. I would probably recommend investing in stocks tho.

1921 2018-03-01 16:42:23 Please follow up your words with real action. Propose stronger background checks, raise the age to purchase, ban bump stocks and assault weapons! Show that you have the courage to confront the NRA.

1937 2018-03-01 16:37:46 No defense is needed. At this point owning bump stocks is not a crime.  You English is as faulty as your logic.
1938 2018-03-01 16:36:12 Thankfully the recovery stocks are my smaller holdings due to the riskier nature. Still confident they can produce the pods in time
1939 2018-03-01 16:35:14 I still think there should have been some sort of conditions tied to hiring People for all that free cash. Instead it was used to scrub books, give out bonuses & pay for stock buybacks. But then it got even worse. It wasn't just used to artificially inflate stocks...
1940 2018-03-01 16:34:49 #Fed's #PowellTestimony said that we are already at #FullEmployment. That is a headwind for #stocks in terms of less stimulus & #inflation pressures. the Fed is at odds with late in the recovery #tax cuts.
1941 2018-03-01 16:34:16 However, given the boost that dicks, etc have seen in their stocks, it seems like it's a good business move to change their policy. That's capitalism for you!
1942 2018-03-01 16:34:08 Uh-oh, I'd better go check my stocks[heads to backyard]BANKER:
1943 2018-03-01 16:33:57 How about against ihub as well?  Lots of manipulation from them as well with janice shell n crew paid by ihub to bash stocks.
1944 2018-03-01 16:33:56 How many do you think th LV shooter would have killed and wounded w a handgun? He manage to kill 58 and wound 500+ in 10 minutes with his arsenal of semi-automatic ARs outfitted w bump stocks & high capacity magazines.
1945 2018-03-01 16:33:37 Hey, if you got nothing good to say, say noting :-) make $$$ instead!!!
1946 2018-03-01 16:33:31 Do you realize it was Obama's ATF which approved bump stocks in the first place?  They tried to figure a way to get out of approving them but decided they didn't have the authority to do so via the executive branch.
1947 2018-03-01 16:33:01 When I have a really good gain I take the ticker off my front page. Put price alerts in. Not stops. And just just at it once/twice a day. Watch action at 8 ema.  #stocks
1948 2018-03-01 16:32:49 Yes. So take that ability away and bam bump stocks.
1949 2018-03-01 16:32:01 bump stocks allow the ability to turn these guns nearly automatic. Which are still perfectly legal
1950 2018-03-01 16:31:51 Atlanta Fed's Q1 GDPNow estimate rebounded to 3.5% 

( Sell stocks)
1951 2018-03-01 16:30:57 So DACA as an executive order was fine, but banning bump stocks would be overreach?
1952 2018-03-01 16:30:45 "If you have trouble imagining a 20% loss in the stock market, you shouldn’t be in stocks." 

— John Bogle
1953 2018-03-01 16:30:37 Banning bump stocks and raising the age to buy rifles is a bandaid on a 12 guage deer slug wound. As long as America has people with no respect for life, laws, and common decency these acts will continue. The killer was an immoral Godless little punk.
1954 2018-03-01 16:30:10 My beloved president BETRAYED ME , HIS BASE.HONESTLY,How is Trump different from Hillary on guns now ? 2020 is in jeopardy.
- END PRIVATE SALES
- considering a new "ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN" (Sara Huckabee)
- BAN bump stocks
-take guns without adjudication

1956 2018-03-01 16:29:26 I put mine in a stocks and shares isa. Although long term you’re better off taking off your mortgage if you have one.
1957 2018-03-01 16:29:15 But he can make it look worse by including bump stocks.  Typical scare tactic.
1958 2018-03-01 16:29:02 Agree generally with this. Bonds have a ratchet quality to them vs stocks for now, IMO.
1959 2018-03-01 16:28:55 ECB UNLIKELY TO SIGNAL POLICY SHIFT IN MARCH MEETING; MAY DISCUSS DROPPING EASING BIAS..... lol should be good for stocks
1960 2018-03-01 16:28:52 Thank you for sharing, I'll go through it and analyze a couple of stocks with it. It's definitely helpful to always keep learning. And this seems really interesting to me!
1961 2018-03-01 16:28:48 If @RepKinzinger thinks bump stocks ban is a "no-brainer", then why didn't the @GOP-led Congress & @GOP @WhiteHouse do anything after #LasVegasShooting???
1962 2018-03-01 16:28:44 Two months ago they could’ve banned bump stocks and gotten credit for doing something. Not anymore, dummies. The kids are coming for you.

1964 2018-03-01 16:27:56 haha but i didnt tell in which asset class ..dont assume its the stock mkt ...or the bond mkt ...hyperinflation stocks can go up...so u know which asset can go up
1965 2018-03-01 16:27:53 i’ll probably just get some new wheels and keep the stocks just to have a back up pair aka ( nobody wants them )
1966 2018-03-01 16:27:52 US stocks going up and down through Powell testimony Near unchanged levels
Powell just said it is not the Feds job to help or hurt the stock market.   And today he is not doing much at least so far.
1967 2018-03-01 16:27:51 Right? I am still long and strong my cryptos and dope stocks :-)
1968 2018-03-01 16:27:36 Condoleezza Rice is correct.  Our civian citizens do not and should not have assault type weapons.  I would also include bump and thumbole stocks and forward grips   This is Not a political issue it is a Human Issue
1969 2018-03-01 16:27:33 @LILUZIVERT so you seeking stocks ? I’m tryna get onna wave but it don’t show inna stock  wtw?

1975 2018-03-01 16:26:12 Don’t forget to ban bump stocks!
1976 2018-03-01 16:25:35 Gotta find the mole! Our triple s stocks are getting eaten!!!!!
1977 2018-03-01 16:25:20 Nancy, he believes that an Executive Order can stop bump stocks, as he'd said he'd "write that out.." two or three doddering times. You've been around awhile, Nancy, but you can out-think Trump without trying. So can most Americans - even if we never attended Wharton! #Resist
1978 2018-03-01 16:25:16 Yes I know that, but to further emphasize it that’s why i said all guns. Stricter background checks and raising ages of when to get guns is what needs to be fixed, along with banning AR-15s cause you don’t need a military grade gun in civilian life and banning bump stocks.
1979 2018-03-01 16:25:08 "Trump weighs steel, aluminum tariffs, sends stocks soaring"
1980 2018-03-01 16:25:01 I get in , the price falls.. i get out the price hikes... I can't read stocks with this software need my DAS back.

1982 2018-03-01 16:24:19 I agree with no high capacity magazines and bump stocks being not sold but if your supposed to be an adult at 18 you should be treated as one.
1983 2018-03-01 16:24:13 ...I need to start managing my stocks better. At least they’re growing.
1984 2018-03-01 16:24:09 Is getting rid of bump stocks caving or throwing a bone?
1985 2018-03-01 16:23:54 Democrats want to eliminate bump stocks? They need to give up reciprocity of CCL. The democrats want to raise the age of purchase, they need to eliminate the ATF tax for suppressors. That is what real compromise is about. 2 of 2
1986 2018-03-01 16:23:41 @redpaint buy more stocks bro duh, this b*tch going to the he moon
1987 2018-03-01 16:23:14 #CorrupTrump claims he will sign legislative order banning bump stocks. IMO its a insult 2every family of a dead person killed wth an AR-15. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. Ppl are on to you. We r not the fools you think we are. Ban ASSAULT weapons & tell NRA Fuck You. Then I’ll believe it
1988 2018-03-01 16:23:09 You're gonna laugh.  I answered another question here - people not bump-stocks! I guess that just wanted to be said.
1989 2018-03-01 16:22:30 $mnga - up 50%+ called it out for you guys a week or two ago. Unfortunately I pulled out and held true to my plan. Made good money in other plays but great job to those who took the alert and held!

1995 2018-03-01 16:20:45 So your point is WHAT? Bump stocks need 2 B banned PERIOD. They enable more bullets 2 be fired in less time. DONT NEED, DONT WANT BUMPSTOCKS
1996 2018-03-01 16:20:27 Don't know if they're a@public company but yhea, talk about committing suicide with your stocks value.
1997 2018-03-01 16:20:27 Well duh! who calls them an Assault Rifle 15 anyway, aside from which they aren't an assault rifle they are a semi automatic they don't qualify as assault rifles under federal law but that doesn't stop people modifying them for bump stocks and automatic fire and killing 17 kids.
1998 2018-03-01 16:20:25 There’s no civilian use for assault rifles… high-capacity magazines… armor piercing bullets... bump-stocks… They’re purpose is killing as many “People” (not animals) as possible as quickly as possible… there is no civilian use for any of them… we’ve seen the deaths already…
1999 2018-03-01 16:20:21 @realDonaldTrump During your campaign you promised Americans no more gun control and now you're trying to make things that I own illegal so the Gov't can legally steal from me. Pull your head out of your ass. NO MORE GUN CONTROL Do not Ban Bump Stocks, Do not Steal from Americans
2000 2018-03-01 16:19:57 Why didn’t anyone mention this to him every time he blurted out “I will handle bump stocks” ?
2001 2018-03-01 16:19:53 Just call them what they really are, "semi-automatic with changeable stocks, sights, rail systems, barrels, suppressors, compensators and depending on the platform you can change caliber as well" rifles. 

Just copy and paste every time
2002 2018-03-01 16:19:50 She’s saying she isn’t sure an EO could completely eliminate bump stocks, not that she doubts the President has the authority to issue an EO. I’d recommend reading up on the difference between EOs and statutes.
2003 2018-03-01 16:19:47 Cafe stocks ?
2004 2018-03-01 16:19:30 She's afraid he'll only ban bump stocks instead of everything that makes someone fire faster because then it would be over.
2005 2018-03-01 16:19:25 Yes, They are investments. But like buying Houses, Gold, or Stocks. But art is (imo) tougher, because it can be so subjective.

So much 4 his support of gun control! 4 yrs Dem held majority did NOTHING
2019 2018-03-01 16:16:40 1/2 Thank you, that's a difference. What I was talking about was just a standard, out of the box firearm. I never saw the purpose of bump stocks and most people I know, would never buy one.
2020 2018-03-01 16:16:26 I would allow him to get rid of "bump stocks" in addition to what you have shown. They are related to "automatic weapons".
2021 2018-03-01 16:16:16 While I am glad to see that @realDonaldTrump wants to ban bump stocks, I think it is clear this must be done through Congressional action. I hope we can proceed in a bipartisan way. #NeverAgain
2022 2018-03-01 16:16:15 Bump stocks have been around for many years. There are hundreds of thousands of them in circulation. sigh

2027 2018-03-01 16:15:04 Often stocks move against you and you have no idea why. Numbers and all look good. Often it’s what you don’t know.  Sell rules are so hugely important. Cut losses quick and move on. Ego kills investors. $clns

2030 2018-03-01 16:14:28 Theory: @realDonaldTrump's Seemingly off-hand comment “Take the guns first, go through due process second,” WILL DRIVE GUN SALES OF ASSAULT WEAPONS~HIGH VOLUME MAGAZINES~BUMP STOCKS so it's just a sales pitch from our @POTUS just more #TrumpLies on behalf of @NRA & #AltRight~

2040 2018-03-01 16:12:13 We need a bill that might make a difference:
Assault weapon ban
Bump stocks ban
Multi bullet cartridge ban
Armor piercing bullets(FFS!) ban
Universal back ground checks
No fly list? No gun
2041 2018-03-01 16:12:08 Does that make them bump stocks?
2042 2018-03-01 16:11:56 Spotify the music streaming service has filed for an initial public offering to go public, the DPO which is one of the most anticipated of the year will trade under name SPOT on New York stock exchange, stocks have traded for $132.50 in private markets, would you buy their stock?
2043 2018-03-01 16:11:47 The issue isn't selling guns. Assault style rifles, automatic weapons, bump stocks etc are the concern. Any step towards reducing the # of those will make a difference. 

And @DICKS @Walmart and others raising the age to 21 for purchasing guns also helps! #GunControl 
2044 2018-03-01 16:11:44 We should be protecting both. But common sense measures like better background checks and stopping the sale of bump stocks
2045 2018-03-01 16:10:59 I think the company keeping more of its money and other company’s feeling good about consumer confidence has to do with it. 

I am just an employee,  can’t say exactly why but I hear from co workers how well there stocks are doing and how crazy the demand is right now.
2046 2018-03-01 16:10:55 Looks like Janet's words were "Carefully Worded" to always please the Market and cause it to go up or stay up. Unlike Powell, he seems to be flip flap with words and his choice of words continues to have a hawkish tone causing more volatility and fear to hold stocks so far. humm.
2047 2018-03-01 16:10:52 @EdwerderRFA The video you're talking about is about bump stocks? No?
2048 2018-03-01 16:10:10 #stocks#ThursdayThoughs  Not a whole lot of conviction today. Investor uncertainty is not a good sign in a context of  Trump's high protective tariff actions. These are disastrous for the stock market. It smells of a depression era economy and a return to Smoot-Hawley protection.
2049 2018-03-01 16:10:06 That company is gonna be butt hurt when they see their stocks plummet
2050 2018-03-01 16:09:55 But expected to somehow pay for all of this whilst working for low pay or no pay 
2051 2018-03-01 16:09:51 Lesson I’ve learned today- only trade penny stocks with 1M or more average volume. Trades are slow otherwise.
2052 2018-03-01 16:09:43 sounds very much like 06. the last surge as people scramble when rates start to go up. starts, permits, home-builder stocks peaking. just ask Jared Kushner... ;-)
2053 2018-03-01 16:09:35 So your are for Trump 120% but say boycott Dicks sporting goods because they want sale a gun to anyone under 21? Did Trump not just say, ''Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks''?  But your not mad at Trump cause he said an wants that done? It defiantly is a mental problem!
2054 2018-03-01 16:09:33 True that. Mining stocks is a very miniscule part of my overall portfolio. I own ZERO other stocks just on principle.
2055 2018-03-01 16:09:01 Stocks are dropping quicker than my gpa

2057 2018-03-01 16:08:35 that same math works for stocks right, add in your broker fees.  BOOM!  Never going down!
2058 2018-03-01 16:08:26 Two of my early/ recovery stocks having a bad day . MPAY down 20% and ITX down almost 10%.
2059 2018-03-01 16:08:22 I actually agree w this.  My solution would be to completely ban assault rifles and bump stocks

If an 18 y/o feels they want a gun for protection/hunting I think that’s ok. But conflicted
2060 2018-03-01 16:08:19 Commission and stocks are coming at the end of the month

2062 2018-03-01 16:07:45 Any bans on bump stocks or fire rate increasing devices can be too widely interpreted to be fair . It would end up as more over reaching regulations that only punish law abiding citizens. I voted for you because I believed you would do the right thing

2075 2018-03-01 16:04:23 Bump stocks for vapes are out of hand. If I was superintendent I'd push for a ban on vapes over 55W
2076 2018-03-01 16:04:19 "Bump stocks" also sounds dirty.
2077 2018-03-01 16:04:14 He’s going to a wall pre build demonstration or some shit soon. Name one thing he didn’t actually try to do he said though, I honestly just am curious to what they are. But I’ll bet bump stocks are illegal in the near future. Along with stronger background checks will be added.
2078 2018-03-01 16:04:05 Lol they are not trying to take all your guns away. Stroger background checks and getting rid of bump stocks will not keep sane rational people from owning Guns. Or is that your problem? You don't think you could pass a background check?

2090 2018-03-01 15:58:16 RT tracksmackdawn: RT SenFeinstein: Machine guns have been banned for decades but a loophole in the law allows bump stocks. These dangerous devices allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at the rate of machine guns. Our bill is the ONLY way to ban them.

2093 2018-03-01 15:57:50 He Already Stepped On The 2nd Amendment, Idjit...By Saying He Was Going To Ban Bump-Stocks".  It's Just The FIRST Step He Will Take.  It Sets A Precedent For The Courts.  If You Knew Anything About Law, You'd Know That.

Meanwhile over in the treasury market, yields are near unchanged levels. Yields were lower at the NA…
2095 2018-03-01 15:56:42 He did say he would ban bump stocks himself.
2096 2018-03-01 15:56:39 Bump stocks are on the chopping block. What else is not banned that Dems would like banned? PS not all mods are related to performance, many are aesthetic. Just bc something "looks" dangerous doesn't mean it is. Except for the Clintons.

2098 2018-03-01 15:56:26 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

2103 2018-03-01 15:55:08 I personally don't care if bump stocks are for sale or not. Give me 3 well placed shots over 30 sporadic shots any day. But to ban an item over one isolated incident is insane.

2119 2018-03-01 15:52:22 The NRA did not promote nuclear weapons and I never said they did. My point is that a nuclear weapon is an arm. You dont have the right to all arms. You dont have a gurantee to bump stocks or the AR-. Keep it real.
2120 2018-03-01 15:52:18 We did not hire him to take our rights but may take his power this November and then fire him in 2020 if he does. Ok with the 21 purchase, background cks & eliminating bump stocks and like devices but not banning firearms of any kind.

2123 2018-03-01 15:51:39 Every time bonds tick up, stocks go down...just looking at the bond charts, that means the market will probably keep selling off for a while (though, doesn't mean every day is red) $SPY $TLT $QQQ
2124 2018-03-01 15:51:08 MBS opened higher, but has moved to near unchanged from yesterday's close.  Yields opened and are still unchanged.  Stocks open in positive territory.

2126 2018-03-01 15:51:00 I don't care about "bump stocks" but giving the left anything on account of their hysterics is giving them too much, and only encourages more hysterics. Bad precedent to set...
2127 2018-03-01 15:51:00 Apparently right before they dumped their stocks .  THEN made the announcement.
2128 2018-03-01 15:50:41 Obama had 8yrs to workout some kind of  bi partisan comprehensive gun control bill ..as well as  using  Executive orders on Bump stocks etc..and nothing

2130 2018-03-01 15:50:32 No one wants to take your gun rights just ones like the AR15s and bump stocks. I doubt seriously that our founding fathers could have even imagined such weapons. Everyone needs to give and take a little bit. So families dont have to live without their children.
2131 2018-03-01 15:50:29 @realDonaldTrump bypassing due process, banning bump stocks, and even considering getting rid of semi auto rifles will get you lumped in with the leftists quick.  From a voter if yours.  Knock it off now!!
2132 2018-03-01 15:50:11 It would seem 98% off people weren't even aware of the existence of bump stocks until Las Vegas.
2133 2018-03-01 15:50:05 #ThursdayThoughts  Despite FedHead Powell's attempt to restore confidence expect another sell-off this afternoon. If it happens, take advantage of really good companies getting a whole lot cheaper with opportunities to mop up on stocks with proven dividend growth.
2134 2018-03-01 15:50:01 He just said he would outlaw bump stocks. 
The Left wants to erode our rights bit by bit.
First it's bump stocks. Then it's no guns for mentally ill. Then Vets suffer PTSD,  so no guns for them. Then it's medical marijuana users. Soon, an aspirin will disqualify you.
2135 2018-03-01 15:49:53 I doubt that since these shootings are commonplace. They want the types of guns banned that were used in these shootings and bump stocks like in Las Vegas. It doesn't matter whether they know all the mechanics of it or not.
2136 2018-03-01 15:49:25 @ScottWapnerCNBC @HalftimeReport we've been talking about if we are gonna see the lows again in the s&p but in reality a lot of individual stocks are already there and below $gm $wmt $low.  #fang creates an illusion
2137 2018-03-01 15:49:22 How often do you need a fully auto weapon? Something that did not even exist when the law was drafted. Bump stocks should be an issue everyone agrees on.
2138 2018-03-01 15:49:21 several stocks had bid's at 8dma $adbe $csco $amzn and hit the bid and bounced. not sure who bid but i was one of them. had stop's below. market still EXTREMELY overbot and prone to selling by weak hands.
2139 2018-03-01 15:49:17 The Market eventually gets it right, but not always immediately. I’ve never believed in efficient Markets. If so, stocks would always be priced correctly.
2140 2018-03-01 15:49:07 Damn should have bought stocks!
2141 2018-03-01 15:49:06 Do you honestly think real gun enthusiasts care about bump stocks? It's a novelty at best.
2142 2018-03-01 15:49:01 when the NE gets a fresh taste of winter this weekend, gas and gas stocks should head back up. If not, maybe time to look at other things
2143 2018-03-01 15:47:45 Is that why he allowed the sale of bump stocks instead?
2144 2018-03-01 15:47:36 Finally purchased marijuana stocks! 16yr old me' s mind would be blown

But realistically 
You only need 10,000 to invest and you wouldn’t need to work if you investered wisely
2148 2018-03-01 15:47:04 Obama approved the sale and lack of regulation of bump stocks.  
Trump wants to ban sale and use of bump stocks.  
Democrats will vote against that.

3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

2197 2018-03-01 15:37:50 Stocks rally as:

a) Powell says nothing to suggest wage inflation is at an acceleration point

b) reports indicate a tariff announcement will NOT come today.

Dow up 115.

2198 2018-03-01 15:37:41 @KarlEggerss Interesting to note the price action in oil and the price of oil stocks and ETF's. Oil down ~2% and stocks/ETF's solidly in the green.

2211 2018-03-01 15:35:17 My guess on Trump take: Have to wait until stocks are back at all-time highs before tariffs.

As far as gun control measure go, banning bump stocks, meh, ok. However, the ban on "assault weapons" is
2216 2018-03-01 15:34:43 Stock market is running on basis of few mega tech stocks like Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook  which is in an bubble and overvalued without having manufacturing, jobs and innovation while real innovation and supply chains are in China, South Korea
2217 2018-03-01 15:34:27 What if the “correction” was institutions shaking the tree to capitalize on the pot stocks before the next run up 
2218 2018-03-01 15:34:26 Getting rid of bump stocks isn’t the answer,  we’re the only ones that have to compromise. Losing more of our #2A rights
2219 2018-03-01 15:34:20 If you put 4 bump stocks on your AR-15 does it shoot 4 times as fast?

2221 2018-03-01 15:34:14 Nope not at all. All law abiding gun owners like me like our guns It’s only one aspect of multi faceted problem in our society. Unfortunately getting rid of semi autos, bump stocks etc are necessary. The mistakes of one will ruin it for the many!

2227 2018-03-01 15:32:27 Raising the age to 21 is wrong I don't think anybody will have a problem with bump stocks. You cannot take away due process and if our men and women die for this country they should be able to carry arms.
2228 2018-03-01 15:32:07 Did Trump ban Bump Stocks yet? WPE!
2229 2018-03-01 15:31:53 Yes, Trump says he is "looking in it"; looking to ban bump stocks through Dept of Justice. But even Trump knows only the legislative branch can pass laws so he wants to stall it with false promises. Carry On Senator.

2239 2018-03-01 15:30:06 I never said people should have automatic weapons. I agree they shouldn't.  Just like I don't agree they should have access to bump stocks or silencers.  The term military grade is laughable because military grade actually means produced by the lowest bidder.
2240 2018-03-01 15:29:58 Trading to be a trader off of pumps is not long term for survival my friends. You have little to no strategies to actually trade stocks and await a chatroom pump? This is sad that traders find this acceptable. its disrespectful to us traders who actually trade setups and learn.

2242 2018-03-01 15:29:47 They shouldn’t be banned!! If the 86’ machine gun ban didn’t exist bump stocks wouldn’t either. Full automatics are a firearm that is protected by the #2A. #ShallNotBeInfringed should actually mean something to these tyrants

2246 2018-03-01 15:29:14 If by "fundamentals of this country" you mean instituting responsible gun laws that keep Americans safe -- such as age and clip capacity limits, bans on militarized weapons and accessories like bump stocks that enable semi automatic guns to shoot like automatics, well then, yes.
2247 2018-03-01 15:28:19 Don’t start backtracking now. You said you would make bump stocks illegal and raise the minimum age to 21.

2250 2018-03-01 15:27:57 @foimbert how about "Stocks rise and fall in choppy trade, Powell testifies again" then you won't look like you are trying to sway the market. @CNBC
2251 2018-03-01 15:27:41 There is an excellent rist/reward chance, short NDQ at 6855. With market environment DXY, WTI unlikely that stocks will hold this level.
2252 2018-03-01 15:27:12 Not only this but trump said "he will ban bump stocks" trump said "consider it done" he better not!
2253 2018-03-01 15:27:02 Yeah, no ... if a weapon can produce multiple casualties in mere seconds, it's the same bloody thing: Small Bombs, Automatic Weapons, Semi Auto w/Bump Stocks ... hmm. quick trigger finger ... Same thing.

2255 2018-03-01 15:26:42 As a value investor, I mostly held my stocks with only purchasing $OTEX this last year. As A. Lincoln said I try to do what is right. If it turns out I’m right all will be well. But if I turn out to be wrong, 7 angels swearing I was right won’t make any difference.

2259 2018-03-01 15:26:29 The only reason they’re going full force after bumps stocks is because they’re easily made using simple things like a belt loop. Their strategy is “hey we outlawed them but look it didn’t make a difference”. I guess it’s better than nothing though.
2260 2018-03-01 15:26:26 I didn't understand that part either.  Clearly Dems want to ban bump stocks, so when Reps were stating that they were also in agreement they wanted to ban them, why did Trump step in?  The two parties were agreeing, let them have that "win".  Executive orders are weak laws also.
2261 2018-03-01 15:26:14 The Evil, Godless & Mentally Challenged Criminals will always find a way 2 carry out Uncivil Acts, Black Market Guns with Bump Stocks, Bombs, Knives & Axes OR a Vehicle 2 Kill!!!
2262 2018-03-01 15:25:57 Should inflation take off, the Fed may be prompted to lift rates faster. The prospect of a more aggressive Fed prompted stocks to fall sharply into correction territory in February while benchmark 10-year Treasury yields jumped to multi-year highs.
2263 2018-03-01 15:25:54 Should have a registry system that issues red flag to FBI when someone like Las Vegas shooter is amassing a huge arsenal of AR15s, bump stocks, magazine clips.  Normal citizens purchasing for hunt or sport do not do this.

2266 2018-03-01 15:24:38 MA is a lead state in US for common sense gun control laws & that is why we have one of the lowest homicide rates by guns. We have strict background check laws on the books & 10-day waiting period before purchase + ban on assault weapons & bump stocks. Common sense gun laws work!

2270 2018-03-01 15:23:40 I have no problems with eliminating bump stocks, raising the age you can buy an AR-15 and improving how we report mental illness to make sure dangerous people don’t get guns. I also want school safety reform. All of these were Trump points.
2271 2018-03-01 15:23:06 Why are we still talking about bump stocks Mr Trump? This is really a no brainer and should have been dealt with after Las Vegas. You talk, then change your mind, then talk, then change your mind. Be done talking, you control the house and senate

2282 2018-03-01 15:20:10 Banks were flush with funds after Demonetization. Interest rates on SB a/c's were reduced even! This is reality kicking in.
Plus if you want more money for Corp, you want people to save/invest in Banks or spend. Instead it was ending up in MF/Stocks.
2283 2018-03-01 15:19:22 He probably misspoke only this time in Libtards favor.  Usually when he does the libs lose their minds. He’s mentioned bump stocks, age, background checks.  Usual stuff.
2284 2018-03-01 15:19:21 How about we just make it really really hard (impossible) for people with violent backgrounds and mental problems to get guns?  Bump stocks should be illegal. The NRA represents the gun lobby, not gun owners. Wake up!

2286 2018-03-01 15:19:10 I wouldn't mind if Congress bans bump stocks.

However, as with most other issues, I don't agree with legislating through executive order.
2287 2018-03-01 15:19:08 and we do, all of the mass shootings have used an AR style rifle, the one in Vegas added bump stocks which made it more deadly.

2291 2018-03-01 15:18:25 Thats it? Ever since $KBSF was pumped by "sellmore" trades , Now traders are holding back? its 10am where are the penny stock traders around the world? i mean 47% of internet and i'm sure ppl in Greenland are playing penny stocks too..we need volume to come.
2292 2018-03-01 15:18:17 Where are the people on the left saying that Trump’s proposals make sense? Better background checks, look at psychiatric issues, raise the age to 21, ban bump stocks, better school security. Sounds like a pretty solid list
2293 2018-03-01 15:17:56 Seems like all the stocks got drove down so a lot of people with a lot of money could buy in cheap
2294 2018-03-01 15:17:53 Shemay. Dami pang stocks oh! Sana may kaclose ako doon tapos inutusan ko hehe huhuhu
2295 2018-03-01 15:17:49 As previously said, like ASX, stocks on LSE should be suspended as soon as a raise is on the cards.
2296 2018-03-01 15:17:43 Meanwhile the POTUS has a very good bi-partisan meeting on stopping school shootings, open to all ideas, will even use Executive Orders to ban Bump Stocks and every Democrat there lauded his openesss and effort. So yeah, this really is desperately urgent even if true.
2297 2018-03-01 15:17:36 And the next gun-grabber step on this line of 'logic' (after banning bump stocks) will be to somehow mechanically inhibit the rate of fire on all semi-autos.
Don't give them an inch, they only see it as weakness and pounce on it.

2298 2018-03-01 15:17:33 Bump stocks should be Illegal. I don’t know how they are going to get past hippa. I agree with the 21 age limit but what about military personnel? I have questions

2308 2018-03-01 15:15:27 So, you want to keep allowing bump stocks? All they do is make a rifle simulate a machine gun.

2311 2018-03-01 15:14:53 @LynetteRomero Bump stocks DO NOT ESSENTIALLY TURN A SEMI AUTOMATIC into a macinne gun. A machine gun when selected to automatic fire will empty magazine with one trigger pull. Bump stock still 1 fire per trigger pull. Get your facts right.
2312 2018-03-01 15:14:50 Greenspan: Of course stocks will go down as treasury yields rise. They always have.
2313 2018-03-01 15:14:48 These are key Stocks
2314 2018-03-01 15:14:39 Yes.  It is important to honor the dead.  Please honor the dead of Parkland by passing legislation to ban all assault weapons and bump stocks.  Write it, pass it, do it. Simple. #NoMoreShootings
2315 2018-03-01 15:13:32 Just wondering about my investments and the future please oh please can we have a STOCK MARKET update. Gotta plan for the future if stocks are failing we are failing. Please with your massively best report. Not hearing you

2318 2018-03-01 15:13:27 Here’s a little fact for you liberals. Bump stocks were LEGALIZED by OBAMA!!!  The left is an absolute disgrace and have no limits to their manipulation!!! Oops can I say manipulation it has the word man in it  personipulation??? Is that the proper term I dont want to offend 
2319 2018-03-01 15:13:05 Bump stocks are junk...toys for wasting ammo and shooting pumpkins. Ban them if you must, but do it according to our Constitution. This is a Congressional issue.
2320 2018-03-01 15:13:04 WHITE PARTY stocks slump
2321 2018-03-01 15:12:56 really didnt know what else to add, didnt want to use the shit fortnite stocks
2322 2018-03-01 15:12:55 Yes.  The one that can help us update our gun laws.  Where can we find help with that?  Banning bump stocks.  Banning assault weapons.  See @Vets4GunReform.
2323 2018-03-01 15:12:41 But rates have not sustained rise. Curve flattened. And stocks not liking that either.
2324 2018-03-01 15:12:34 Please do not touch the 2nd Amdmnt. Ban bump stocks only. Focus on mental illness, Big Pharma who boost these kids up on hyper drugs and depression drugs. The violent TV and video games. FAMILY! 
CHANGE STARTS IN THE HEARTS AND HOMES OF PARENTS! WE LOVE YOU.
DON'T LET US DOWN!
2325 2018-03-01 15:12:28 @senrobportman Hey Portman I hope you are with the president confiscating guns and doing away with the bump stocks.
2326 2018-03-01 15:12:09 You know I can do with the age being raised to 21, bump stocks... eh whatever I can shoot faster and more accurate anyways, ridiculously high cap mags... ok whatever sucks but yeah. Getting rid of most guns? That’s not gonna work.

2328 2018-03-01 15:11:16 I’m still cackling over Paul Ryan’s face when trump said he wanted to write an EO banning bump stocks
2329 2018-03-01 15:11:04 We already have stocks of that

2334 2018-03-01 15:10:03 share market is on downslide ,banks stocks r crumbling everyday ,what is the fault of common investor ,who puts there hard earned money in these stocks ,and now higher intrest rates for our EMI ...to be charged from us for sins of chota modi ,chowksi ,mehta
2335 2018-03-01 15:10:02 You respect the 2A by not infringing on it.  Banning bump stocks, raising the purchase age and grabbing guns without due process is defined as "infringement".
2336 2018-03-01 15:09:54 not at all, that I remember.  I’ve only handled one a handful of times, though.

My point would still be that, as is their main selling point in how they’re advertised & reviewed, bump stocks increase user comfort in sustaining rates of fire
2337 2018-03-01 15:09:50 A5: I wouldn't do this in the classroom because I want to teach younger kids. But, in high school my economics teacher made us pick 5 stocks of our choosing and we followed the stocks throughout the year. We had "money" and had to make sure not to over spend. #ap3040
2338 2018-03-01 15:09:42 What the left sees is a gun owner.

It's been proven time and time again. 

I get what you're saying; sacrifice bump stocks because they're irrelevant. 

Get what I'm saying; Congress should do that, not an EO and that the left uses EVERY win to push MORE.

2340 2018-03-01 15:09:40 What is wrong with you people.  The average American does not want to take your right to protect yourself.  We want to protect ourselves by getting rid of bump stocks, military weapons, and strengthen background checks.  How does that effect your ability to protect yourself?
2341 2018-03-01 15:09:30 Respect the 1st Amendment! Assault weapons were never meant to be part of the 2nd amendment, nor were bump stocks. We need universal background checks, weapons ONLY sold in licensed gun shops and a ban of all assault-type weapons.

2354 2018-03-01 15:07:09 Exactly Mr President! Respect the 2A! Raising the age and banning bump stocks is not the answer! How many teens are killed in Chicago or Baltimore where gun laws are strictest? You want to stop school shootings then ban gun free zones where 98% of these things happen!
2355 2018-03-01 15:06:54 Bump stocks aren't even necessary to bumpfire

2361 2018-03-01 15:04:51 There’s no civilian use for assault rifles… high-capacity magazines… armor piercing bullets... bump-stocks… They’re purpose is killing as many “People” (not animals) as possible as quickly as possible… there is no civilian use for any of them… we’ve seen what they can do…
2362 2018-03-01 15:04:46 I don’t know anyone that thinks that NRA members are bad people.  We are pissed that the NRA continues to block legislation around gun reform such as the illegalization if bump stocks, as the easiest example.  Blocked legislation 5 times!  How does this make any sense???
2363 2018-03-01 15:04:36 Cars serve a purpose to the individual and community and are regulated. Fertilizer bomb and plane were used as weapons...both saw strict regulation increases. AR-15 and bump stocks serve no purpose in modern society other than as tools of mass violence.

2365 2018-03-01 15:04:13 We can’t all agree the same all the time. Bump stocks and age limits is petty! A person under the age of 21 can still freaking hunt! Just can’t buy the riffle. What’s the big deal?
2366 2018-03-01 15:04:00 So if anybody wants to buy an AR-15 y’all might as will hop to it now. Because sooner or later they’ll be banned. Which is insane. It’s not the fucking guns. It’s the fucking people that’s doin it. High capacity mags and bump stocks are already banned.
2367 2018-03-01 15:03:50 Well when you consider that bump stocks are legal , then yes they can.
2368 2018-03-01 15:03:50 Banning bump stocks, AR15s, high capacity magazines, increasing purchase age to 21 are great steps BUT all of these are the equivalent to plugging a leak in a sinking boat with 1000 leaks.

2369 2018-03-01 15:03:49 Because it's dumb to give up something without getting something else in return.  Give us nationwide ccw reciprocity and I'll gladly support giving up bump stocks.
2370 2018-03-01 15:03:48 Aren’t you guys supposed to be fiscal conservatives.  What your talking about will cost millions.  Banning assault type guns, increased back ground checks, ban bump stocks, Brady laws. Cost minimal   Teachers with guns . How are responders supposed to know who they r.
2371 2018-03-01 15:03:41 There’s no civilian use for assault rifles… high-capacity magazines… armor piercing bullets... bump-stocks… They’re purpose is killing as many “People” (not animals) as possible as quickly as possible… there is no civilian use for any of them… we’ve seen what they can do…
2372 2018-03-01 15:03:27 After mass shooting in Florida United States, efforts to  ban bump stocks, improve background checks and arm teachers are among ideas officials have recently floated. However, the republicans give soft support. Will the bill pass and gun control succeed in United States?

2379 2018-03-01 15:02:13 What’s an assault gun?  You mean an automatic weapon?  AR-15s are all single action rifles (squeeze trigger and shoot one round) unless you’ve added some “bump” mechanism.  Make bump stocks and all other items that make single shot rifles into automatics and I’m with you 100%.

2390 2018-03-01 14:59:59 wall street firms have turned the markets into a SCAM,  stocks down 15 percent on average since December. So much for a tax refund.
2391 2018-03-01 14:59:52 It also says nothing about bump stocks and semi automatics that can shoot 100 bullets a minute.  It also, I'm fairly certain, is pro states rights...so that whole conceal carry reciprocity is pretty damn unconstitutional.

> Dom. Violence conviction=no guns
> Red flag mental health/psych issues
> Ban Bump Stocks
> Ban AR 15s & equivalent guns
> Ban Mega-shot clips 
> Ban body/armor shredding ammo
2400 2018-03-01 14:55:15 You're absolutely right. Our constitutional rights are not to be used as bargaining chips to appease the democrats. If he thinks the Dems are going draw the line at bump stocks and AR-15's he's insane.

2422 2018-03-01 14:50:13 I think you're missing the point actually. .6% is nominal, and not at all indicative of what you are assuming. 

With that, since opening today, dicks stocks are down .4%. Continuing the decline that's been happening since 2016. They are now -50% since then. Keep stretching.

2424 2018-03-01 14:49:35 I think that just the words, bump stocks, needs to be changed to devices that alter semi-automatic rifles to fire like machine guns.  I say this because someone will come up with another device and call it by another name and it will not be under the ban.

2430 2018-03-01 14:48:20 Do you also agree with the ban on rubber bands, belt loops, wood dowels, and fingers?  Banning stocks changes nothing.  It just exemplifies a fear in people for what they don’t understand.

2445 2018-03-01 14:43:17 Your TWEET is FALSE.
US steel production was up 5% last yr (90M tons), and production has been steady since 2010. Steel profits/stocks are up. US already has 160+ special duties on steel imports. Most imports come from US allies (China = 11th). DoD needs only 3% of US steel.

2447 2018-03-01 14:42:59 This is misleading in a way.  In 1984 he was elected overwhelmingly.  In 1986 he lost his majority in congress over the ban on new machineguns.  President Trump should pay attention to this.  No one cares about bump stocks.  They care about bans and not enforcing current law

2457 2018-03-01 14:40:56 yeah but I doubt you can keep that up for 11 minutes like the Las Vegas shooter did via bump stocks.  Not that the limitations to mass shootings should be finger cramps, but that the tool definitely enabled greater carnage
2458 2018-03-01 14:40:55 I’ll put bump stocks on the table if they put sanctuary cities up.
2459 2018-03-01 14:40:45 You're not supporting 2nd amendment when Diane Feinstein claps in support. You ban bump stocks so what prevents the next Dem Prez from banning ammo & a class of weapons he/she deems unnecessary ?. You're going against the NRA & law-abiding citizens & is a sell out to antigunners

  Always stay ahead of the enemy.....
2462 2018-03-01 14:38:58 Banning bump stocks won’t change a damn thing. The only change with them I can get behind is moving them to NFA without banning manufacture and that is grudgingly.
2463 2018-03-01 14:38:42 And Equifax administrators sat on the information while they sold off their stocks. Yet DOJ has done nothing to investigate their obvious corruption.

2471 2018-03-01 14:37:16 I see bump stocks as a modification like a sawed off shotgun (which isn't legal). I have no problem banning them. If you need the automatic feel go rent one at a gun range or become a broker to own one.

2474 2018-03-01 14:36:37 I was under the impression banning bump stocks needed congressional amendments not an EO from Clowny.
2475 2018-03-01 14:36:28 In the wake of Paddock shooting up Las Vegas Illinois' legislature introduced a bill to ban bump stocks. @AdamKinzinger voted against that. Don't expect anything sensible from him. He's a vampire.
2476 2018-03-01 14:36:17 And after the initial drop I've made a good amount on their stocks
2477 2018-03-01 14:35:59 Amen!
2478 2018-03-01 14:35:22 their excuse for not banning bump stocks is pathetic. where is the evidence that suggests there's a slippery slope regarding bans? if we're going to start comparing the U.S. to other countries regarding gun laws, look beyond Venezuela.

2482 2018-03-01 14:34:44 Banning bump stocks and raising the age requirement is not banning our guns

2490 2018-03-01 14:33:12 Since bump stocks are products designed to create an end run around the automatic weapons ban, isn’t the EO reasonably constrained to protect current law?
2491 2018-03-01 14:33:08 They're calling for action and using any means necessary to pressure politicians to pass SOMETHING. I think you underestimate the passion a teenager can hold. The only agenda is to end murder. Is that not a bipartisan idea? They haven't even banned bump stocks yet.

2501 2018-03-01 14:29:05 Right, that means we should ban bump stocks and assault rifles.
2502 2018-03-01 14:28:49 If it were up to the left, gun control would be much stricter.  Automatic and semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks would be banned, mentally ill people wouldn't be allowed to buy guns, and background checks would be required on ALL gun sales.

2508 2018-03-01 14:27:46 "Very close" has no legal meaning. Either a gun is automatic, or it's not. Bump stocks do not make guns into automatic weapons. Therefore, it doesn't fall under federal guidelines for automatic weapons. Therefore, it's up to Congress to deal with them.

2517 2018-03-01 14:24:43 I am a staunch supporter of 2A; however if bump stocks arent banned it will only serve as “the stage” for next lunatic shooter; its the MEDIA that gave AR a bad rap by sensationalizing each time its used in that manner. This nation news spotlight these killers; too much attention
2518 2018-03-01 14:23:26 Manchin/Toomey is not enough!  Ban bump stocks, ban extended clips, raise purchase age to 21, ban assault weapons, thorough background checks for ALL purchases and waiting periods.  The groper in chief has been right about 1 thing only, GOP fear of NRA!
2519 2018-03-01 14:23:24 I see like maybe 2-3 trolls here. So, I can Reasonably say the vast majority of Americans agree. Suck it up. A ban on assault weapons and bump stocks is the way to go.
2520 2018-03-01 14:23:08 Random thoughts.  Bonds and dollar going higher with stocks going down after Powell would likely confuse the masses
2521 2018-03-01 14:22:45 No it doesn’t have to go through Congress...as there is already a law that bans automatic weapons...and bump stocks can be included in that definition section, as they do create fire power very close to an auto.
2522 2018-03-01 14:22:43 @DiMartinoBooth I'll be VERY interested to see tone of Powell's remarks today ... hopefully, he remains impervious to recent volatility in stocks, but surely THIS week not bad enough for him to actually address directly! Doubt Yellen even would ... Bullard and Kaskari, well lol!
2523 2018-03-01 14:22:41 Also bump stocks make the gun less accurate. So you are firing faster but with much less accuracy.
2524 2018-03-01 14:22:20 Well, maybe, but I damn sure double-checked that my funds didn’t have gun stocks. If they did, I’d have moved, but they didn’t.

2529 2018-03-01 14:21:33 I think most are afraid if they allow the gov to ban bump stocks it will give the anti-gun people a victory and that will energize them to push for more. They already have people convinced that the AR-15 is an assault rifle similar to a machine gun.
2530 2018-03-01 14:21:28 They never conceived of automatic/assault rifles or bump stocks being sold to anyone with the cash to buy them.   The second amendment says NOTHING about the freedom to shoot other citizens.   It is not the right to kil CHILDREN.

2545 2018-03-01 14:17:06 1. I have never used a bump stock.
2. The same argument against bump stocks ( not necessary for gun) can be used against a 30 round clip (10 works as well)
3. Same argument against auto used against semi auto.

2550 2018-03-01 14:14:22 It would be extreme measures to ban ALL semi auto guns because they have the same action. I will agree to ban high capacity magazines for rifles only and to grandfather possession of them to those who already have them. Bump stocks as well as there is no good reason to own them

2556 2018-03-01 14:13:01 Yes the magazine is part of the firearm, but there is no constitutional right to a 30 round magazine. 

Would you be cool with an EO that banned 30 round magazines?

Yes bump stocks are irrelevant, the point is about EOs being used to ban.

2558 2018-03-01 14:12:06 Depends which size you are after David? We have XSB - MB sizes left in Black. We also have the longer bench coats available in junior sizes. 

We don’t have a date for further stocks as of yet as we tend to re-stock this line around autumn time.
2559 2018-03-01 14:11:54 I don’t even agree with the general policy. But that’s probably because I understand how guns and bump firing work, and how bump stocks don’t do jack squat that you can’t already do without them.
2560 2018-03-01 14:11:45 First, he came for your bump stocks, then did background checks and age limit, now he is coming for your AR-15...

2563 2018-03-01 14:10:49 Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Obama use an EO to authorize bump stocks?

2567 2018-03-01 14:09:54 Because it's asinine. If deaths "caused by" bump stocks justify their banning, then pistols should be banned. More people are killed by pistols. This slope is icy and greased with artisanal olive oil.
2568 2018-03-01 14:09:44 Actually he can, this is the problem with our current system. The legislative branch has delegated legislation to the executive branch via regulations. The ATF can through regulations ban bump stocks under direction from executive order without any legislative body involvement.
2569 2018-03-01 14:09:36 I agree. Many stocks were 100% or more higher in late 2016 w/ crude at $45-50.  There are other factors at play, some company specific, but still ...
2570 2018-03-01 14:09:28 I choose stock by seeing:
1. Pedigree or Mgmt of Stock 
2. Business model & it's need in present & future time.
3. Buyers sentiments.
4. I avoid penny stocks.
5. DII and promoters exposure.
6. Gut feelings.

2572 2018-03-01 14:09:14 I watched a man make a bump stick out of a boot lace. Took him 30 seconds. But manufactured bump stocks should be removed imo

2575 2018-03-01 14:09:04 When will @realDonaldTrump sign that EO on banning bump stocks??
2576 2018-03-01 14:09:02 @realDonaldTrump we voted you into Presidency, to protect our rights and our freedoms. The NRA is not the problem, bump stocks aren’t the problem. Liberal and Democratic agenda’s, are the problem. An 18 yr old can die for their country, but not drink a beer or own a gun? #NoBans
2577 2018-03-01 14:08:54 Must be 21 no bump stocks Only you can do this sir!
2578 2018-03-01 14:08:03 Write a bill to ban them.  Do you understand how ridiculous it is that any civilian can buy a “weapon of war”?  Ban assault rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks....please!
2579 2018-03-01 14:08:01 Ummm...He said he would take care of Bump Stocks with an executive order...Was there even a bump stock used in Florida? Gee let's not work with any facts here.
2580 2018-03-01 14:07:37 It will accomplish nothing. DIY bump stocks are easy; even a belt loop can get the job done, with a little practice.
2581 2018-03-01 14:07:12 Empty, meaningless gestures do nothing to save lives, whether the gesture is what Dick's is doing or an EO banning bump stocks.
2582 2018-03-01 14:06:46 Rubio, when will YOU start tweeting about banning something?  Like assault style rifles or bump stocks or letting kids purchase assault style rifles?  Again, you are avoiding the issue!
2583 2018-03-01 14:06:46 Kids over guns Full background checks, 21 age to buy guns Ban bump stocks, assault weapons Why is MAR A LARGO A GUN FREE ZONE ? #NeverAgain or #VoteThemOut #EnoughIsEnough
2584 2018-03-01 14:06:24 To you maybe, not to me. Better background checks, close gun shown loop hole, limit magazine sizes, and ban devices like bump stocks.

That's common sense.
2585 2018-03-01 14:06:14 1.  If 18 yr olds can't buy guns, then, for all the same reasoning, they certainly shouldn't be voting.
2.  Bump stocks are garbage and skirting the law, but shouldn't we at least be demanding the passage of the Hearing Protection Act as compromise?
2586 2018-03-01 14:06:10 Not sure you’re cilla could take another game of bowling stocks

2590 2018-03-01 14:04:49 Nobody cares about bump stocks everybody wants background checks, but if you change the age to  21 to buy a gun then changed the age to 21 to join the military.@realDonaldTrump

2615 2018-03-01 13:58:34 So if we ban bump stocks they won’t be available any more - like drugs. Right? Just pushes them to the black market and accomplishes absolutely nothing.
2616 2018-03-01 13:58:32 But can he order the ATF to take actions on things like bump-stocks, where the lines are a bit gray and fuzzy?
They might get tied up in courts, but the final outcomes could take years.
2617 2018-03-01 13:58:25 My only problem with banning bump-stocks, it would be heralded as a "stunning rebuke to Trump" from sea to shining sea. I'm at that point where I hate to give these bastards anything.

2620 2018-03-01 13:58:03 @SenFeinstein agrees that a ban of bump stocks by executive order is unconstitutional. When did Republicans become a big supporter of expanded executive power? Oh yeah, when one of them is @POTUS.
2621 2018-03-01 13:57:39 Banning assault weapons and bumper stocks along with background checks are the way to go.  Will not effect the 2nd amendment.

2624 2018-03-01 13:57:04 Respect  2nd amendment & still have better gun laws.  No to AR15 bump stocks semi automatic Yes to better background checks  no to conceal

2628 2018-03-01 13:56:25 Isn’t America funny. By saying we want to eliminate AK-47s bump stocks and rapid firing fire arms, some people think that means we want to ban all guns. Some does not equal all.

2630 2018-03-01 13:56:07 Wednesday's closes:  Stocks were also undercut by the unexpected -4.7% drop in U.S. Jan pending home sales, weaker than expectations of a +0.5% m/m increase and the biggest decline in 7-1/2 years.
2631 2018-03-01 13:55:44 Wednesday's closes: The S&P 500 on Wednesday closed lower on negative carry-over from a slide in Chinese stocks on economic concerns after the China Feb manufacturing PMI fell -1.0 to 50.3, weaker than expectations of -0.2 to 51.1 and the slowest pace of expansion in 1-1/2 years.

2634 2018-03-01 13:55:30 Just wondering where you stand: "I  like taking the guns early,” Trump said. "You won’t have to worry about bump stocks.” "Strong background checks". Yet you undid Obama's EO for background checks and won the election screaming the Democrats will take your guns. SHAME. FAKE.

2646 2018-03-01 13:52:49 Absolutely not...there is nothing unconstitutional about banning bump stocks...in fact they are NOT protected by they 2nd, as it is not a firearm, nor necessary for a firearm, EXCEPT to make it function close to a weapon that is banned!  Not counting those grandfathered in!

2667 2018-03-01 13:44:27 Sir for me the bump stocks, was only the item,(healthcare, taxes,  illegals voting) it was how he said “I’m writing it out.”  I respect strong leadership, Lord knows we need it. Re; ()  I understand that 2 of those are wrong & only 1  is a right. We have to deal with al 3 .
2668 2018-03-01 13:44:10 But outlaw bump stocks with xo. Was illegal you said @GOP  . Why not amand the FOBA act with a prohibition of features with increase the effective fire rate of semi-automatic weapons and/or limit rpm of semi-automatic to 100 rpm .
2669 2018-03-01 13:43:48 And he's not. I think for the most part we can all agree on more vigorous background checks, banning bump stocks, and making sure the mentally ill do not get their hands on guns.
2670 2018-03-01 13:43:07 I am concerned about your position on some of this issue. The biggest failures in the shooting were govt agencies. NOT bump stocks, not age, not even the gun per se. But those who refused to act on the reports on this kids should be held liable for the shooting even happening!

2672 2018-03-01 13:42:42 This doesn't relate to your point, Maggie, but I looked at the link and need to comment on something 45 said. "... [my] administration [is] drafting an executive order that would ban rapid-fire gun bump stocks." Didn't he bitch to high heaven that EOs "aren't law"?
2673 2018-03-01 13:41:55 They - Trump, NRA and Schools aren't banning guns; THEY WANT well trained, expert shooters/teachers, administration to be given the option to CARRY, while removing bump stocks. That sounds reasonable to me!

2675 2018-03-01 13:41:12 This reminds me when they were pushing their price predictions on oil to reach  $200 a barrel when it was trading  $140 already in 2008. They were selling their oil stocks and taking shorts futures while telling their clients to go long on OIL.

2680 2018-03-01 13:39:27 Well, as long as we all agree with banning "bump stocks," then to hell with the Constitution.

Presidential dictates are cool now.

Sweet!

2682 2018-03-01 13:39:25 No guns till age 21, no bump stocks, ban AR-15s & equivalent guns, ban multi-shot clips, ban body-shredding ammo, make background checks & registration universal, use red flags & restraining orders, no guns for those on no fly list, boycott NRA, vote out its puppets. #NeverAgain!
2683 2018-03-01 13:39:13 The Las Vegas shooter used bump stocks.  That's why they're being talked about!
2684 2018-03-01 13:38:22 Wrong. He was talking about a mentally ill person with 49 visits to the house. And yes, he's open to some common sense gun legislation, but doesn't mean he coming to take our guns. Making background checks tougher, banning bump stocks, increasing the age limit, all common sense.
2685 2018-03-01 13:37:58 We're not sure about that. If we have stocks left we might but it's undecided. Do keep an eye on this acc as we'll update if we decided to do it!

2687 2018-03-01 13:37:19 So, ban bump stocks and raise the age...then it happens again. What do you do next...? And then it happens again...? And so on and so on and so on and so on… Until finally the Second Amendment is no more. And then it happens again.
2688 2018-03-01 13:37:17 The President HASN'T said all teachers be armed; he said those willing, trained & VERY accurate/safe teachers should be GIVEN THE OPTION TO CARRY A FIREARM at School. He's also working on legislation to ban bump stocks. So NO DON'T be armed if you &your class wouldn't be safe!

2694 2018-03-01 13:36:26 Mr. Trump don't give up the fight on guns. I don't so much agree with the banning of bump stocks but I know you have to give someplace and you aren't gonna make everyone happy. Once you give an inch, those libtards will want a mile. #MAGA #2A
2695 2018-03-01 13:36:20 I personally care about bump stocks, it's a method you can bump fire a pistol, the point is they will take more
2696 2018-03-01 13:36:17 Contrary to popular belief, friends, banning bump stocks, large capacity magazines, and body armor is not a violation of your 2nd amendment rights.
2697 2018-03-01 13:36:14 So what about all of the other mass shootings Byron? How about Las Vegas where the shooter used AR-15s equipped with bump stocks to kill 58 people.

2705 2018-03-01 13:34:32 Bump stocks are still legal, so civilians can own weapons that function as "automatic."

2707 2018-03-01 13:34:18 @patmiletich Curious. Do you disagree with any of these?
1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

2711 2018-03-01 13:33:38 He's already said, he's open to making background checks more rigorous, increasing the age limit, hardening school security, and outlawing bump stocks.

2719 2018-03-01 13:30:05 Well, that doesn't surprise me, I just mean it probably doesn't have to look that way. I do think any legislation should target features, not styling. Magazine size, bump stocks, speed, etc, not appearance.
2720 2018-03-01 13:29:18 or could just sell the handful of gun stocks and open new ETF called the Russell (Almost) 2000
2721 2018-03-01 13:29:17 Can't believe you're an NRA member. How can you support that organization? The NRA is not about sport and hunting. NOONE NEEDS AN ASSAULT RIFLE, HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES, BUMP STOCKS OR RAPID FIRE WEAPONS. #NRABloodMoney

2723 2018-03-01 13:28:59 The important question is not whether we ban bump stocks, but HOW we ban them.

The Constitution should matter to you.

2733 2018-03-01 13:26:04 Increased household net worth for those who own stocks? Sometimes translates into more spending.
2734 2018-03-01 13:25:39 All of @POTUS' talk about bump stocks and raising the age for buying weapons to 21, as well as pointing out how petrified Congress is of the NRA, are pretty much worthless posturing. He knows that Congress is useless and owned by the gun lobby and won't do anything substantial.

2748 2018-03-01 13:21:01 @foxandfriends Bump stocks? Used in one crime and meaningless impact on crime. Show boating and BS.
2749 2018-03-01 13:20:19 @SenFeinstein bump stocks certainly should be banned, but that alone only takes the capability of a semi-auto down from 9 bullets per second to 2.3 (on average). let's do the math on how many mothers you'll have to console. semi-autos have no place in society, NONE! #neveragain
2750 2018-03-01 13:20:05 Pink guns, blue guns, guns with stars and stripes, multi-round magazines, bump stocks. We are treating weapons as if they are toys. The more bullets coming out of the barrel the better, it is a sick culture. We need regulations, it's part of the 2nd Amendment.
2751 2018-03-01 13:19:51 All those things are great. Plus why not a 0.03 tax on all trades, stocks, and bonds and derivative instruments? Our friends at Wall Street should be paying their fair share 
2752 2018-03-01 13:19:30 Mr President, bump stocks and raising the age to purchase firearms are invalid solutions. If you are going to push raising the age to keep and bear arms, then raise the age to be an adult! If good decisions can't be made at 18, then push to raise the adult of an adult to 21

P.S. If you want to ban bump stocks, then pass a law through CONGRESS.
2756 2018-03-01 13:17:59 Were talking about bump stocks here. On top of that, I don’t give a shit about guns. Liberals want more regulation. Barack had the chance, didn’t do it. Complain about that.
2757 2018-03-01 13:17:29 Stocks replenished then? 
2758 2018-03-01 13:17:21 Assault style rifles have already been banned. Assault means it’s automatic. AR-15 is semi-automatic, and bump stocks are also in the process of being banned. :)
2759 2018-03-01 13:17:19 No, and bump stocks were never used in a mass shooting. Your DeepState Democrat CIA worked with Saudi prince Talal who shot up the harvest festival full of Trump supporters&Christians from helicopters with SAW machine guns.
FBI&CIA set up MSMDouglas High shooting.

Seriously, what do you need a military style rifle, high cap mags, and bump stocks for? Planning something we should know about?
2766 2018-03-01 13:16:00 Good rule to have in place. People need to stop worrying.  Let Trump ban bump stocks, who cares? Raise age to 21 & do better background checks. Put armed security in schools. He needs to show he’s protecting kids.
2767 2018-03-01 13:15:59 @amyklobuchar We need legitimate gun control. Ban on automatic weapons, high velocity rounds, bump stocks. You have to be 21 to buy beer, but not a gun?? No one ever walked into school with a 12-pack of beer and slaughtered a classroom of children.
2768 2018-03-01 13:15:59 @SenFeinstein these "fixes" you are "discussing" (as we're dying on the front lines) are a diversion meant to quell the public outrage. bump stocks have not been used, nor has under age 21 been an issue and probably not even background checks IN MOST MASS SHOOTINGS! #neveragain
2769 2018-03-01 13:15:45 @SenJeffFlake NOT enough. BAN assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks and tighten background checks.

2775 2018-03-01 13:13:24 @Varneyco What happened to money for nothing and stocks for lots?
2776 2018-03-01 13:13:20 Not sure I agree with this. I'm an ex cop who doesn't believe people need assault weapons, bump stocks, and banana clips. I'm for common sense gun control, and limiting fire arm purchases to those over 21 makes sense.
2777 2018-03-01 13:13:17 He already has!  The EO on bump stocks was an infringement.
2778 2018-03-01 13:13:00 Il existe dans d'autres couleurs saisonnières, mais les stocks ne sont pas garantis... Si vous me communiquez votre taille, nous pouvons vérifier les stocks du fournisseur et vous dire en DM vos options !
2779 2018-03-01 13:12:23 "Respect Second Amendment!" Goes on to ban bump stocks via EO, wants universal background checks (registries/lists of law abiding), says he's open to an AWB, and says "confiscate now, due process later." Dude - you are so a one term POTUS.
2780 2018-03-01 13:12:23 I will concede though that Bump Stocks should be banned based on my limited knowledge of those.  I'm sure some would disagree.  Just my opinion.
2781 2018-03-01 13:12:21 @realDonaldTrump Civilians don't need automatic weopons. Get rid of them and bump stocks and watch your ratings sky rocket!

2783 2018-03-01 13:11:55 All of these governors and lawmakers need to seriously look at the size of magazines.  If there were no high capacity magazines (or bump stocks), if someone got a hold of an AR-15, their bullets would be very limited.
2784 2018-03-01 13:11:01 There is going to be a trade war because F&F told him so, who owns stocks in American companies at Fox?
2785 2018-03-01 13:10:44 1-Mandate universal background checks, no exceptions, including during gun shows. 2-You must be 21 to purchase a gun. 3-Ban assault weapons and institute a buy back program for previous owners of same. 4-Ban bump-stocks, large magazines, silencers permanently.7-Require gun locks

2795 2018-03-01 13:07:13 I agree Mark I don't like Trumps EO Decision I think its all a slippery slope. I just think if we are not careful with gimmicks like bump stocks they will come after the whole rifle next. We need to be wise and a skirting the law with bump stocks is not wise its fun! but not wise
2796 2018-03-01 13:07:03 I have been on Trump train since day #1. President you know as well as your base that raising age to 21 & eliminating bump stocks r symbolism over substance. Arming law-abiding citizens is the answer. It's our right to bear all arms in self defense.

2808 2018-03-01 13:04:03 C'est une petite succursale que j'ai ouverte là-bas, pour désengorger un peu mes stocks ici (ça devenait difficile à gérer). Roro et moi sommes actionnaires à 50/50.
2809 2018-03-01 13:03:53 Also interesting 93-94 hit .6 before Greenspan interrupted the stock rally with aggressive hikes...then with low inflation, and the TNX rising briefly to the downtrend,  he cut rates and stocks took off again.
2810 2018-03-01 13:03:46 That’s a good point Bill. I just hope he doesn’t dabble in banning rifles with black plastic stocks. It will hurt him with his right base who are more politically involved
2811 2018-03-01 13:03:45 You seem to have forgotten job-robbing immigration policies. Dumping bump stocks matters less than not dumping various visa programs.
2812 2018-03-01 13:03:29 UK has always been able to take their pick, no euro, no shengen, we were the leaders -no more thanks to those wanting to ’take back control’ sterling is weak, prices are up, billy no mates and laughing stocks
2813 2018-03-01 13:02:55 Fear in retail now not just re-rating of stocks but of administration
2814 2018-03-01 13:02:35 Agree we don't need bump stocks. When will the democrats stop blocking Trump appointments?

2821 2018-03-01 13:00:12 The 2nd Amendment says a well regulated militia can bear arms. What is the definition of “well regulated militia?”  SCOTUS screwed up. There is no individual in “militia”.  BAN assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks. Better background checks.

2832 2018-03-01 12:57:31 When I see a beautiful AR-15, I just start taking them, I can't help myself. It's different for presidents, they'll let you do anything. You can just walk up and grab em' by their bump stocks.

2839 2018-03-01 12:56:21 President Trump should know the bump stocks are useless, people kill people not guns, and to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally deranged and violent criminals.

2841 2018-03-01 12:55:55 Also can't use 1990s model for 'strong USD = strong US stocks' b/c global CB's were still sterilizing US deficits then...they aren't anymore for 1st time in 70 yrs.  That puts a huge hole into any model that is not 70 yrs old...
2842 2018-03-01 12:55:00 Healthcare stocks plummet
2843 2018-03-01 12:54:56 I liked your ideas Mr. Trump. Ban on bump stocks, raise minimum purchase age to 21, universal background checks. Those are great ideas and I hope you follow throughout the on those things. As a mom I want to protect my children. Please help
2844 2018-03-01 12:54:53 Strong USD makes USD-denom debt much less payable.  No one has more USD-denom debt than USA.  No one.  Can't use the "strong USD = strong stocks" model from the 1990s anymore b/c the total debt & derivative picture & demographics of US were WILDLY different
2845 2018-03-01 12:54:31 Where I lack insight is re how much turnover is common amongst stocks w leading short interests (i.e. does large short action tend to persist?) Good ole $GE, everyday I owned it (cost basis of 17 bucks saved me when i got out at 30 what a mess) was it seemed always a top short.
2846 2018-03-01 12:53:57 @realDonaldTrump You vow to ban bump stocks, so why not AR15 type and magazines.  Take the plunge standing up to NRA and congress who is in the
NRA's back pocket.  Don't sell your soul when you know what's right.
2847 2018-03-01 12:53:10 Retail learned how to buy stocks. Schwab. Effectively arbed the diff between savings and death benefits. Hence term life.
2848 2018-03-01 12:53:09 Fuck the second amendment. Respect people. NOBODY has the RIGHT to own 40 assault rifles with silencers and bump stocks.
You can't tell a good idea from a bad one. Arming teachers is the WORST!
2849 2018-03-01 12:52:40 Um, his was the worst economic recovery post recession EVER. Stocks went up, because the feds never raised rates. Think about that, 8 years and the feds thought the economy was so shit they never raised rates once. 1st pres in history w/o 3% growth.

2853 2018-03-01 12:51:25 So what GOP & Dem will lead with a bill calling for ban on ARs, raising age from 18 to 21 to purchase Military style weapons, real effective background checks, waiting (cool down) periods, ban high capacity magazines & bump stocks. Don't pick one, do them all
2854 2018-03-01 12:51:18 That was just part of his show. He won't do any REAL change on gun reform. Bump stocks is something the NRA doesn't care about anyway so that's not REALLY taking on the NRA.
2855 2018-03-01 12:51:07 You should have your FFL revoked for such ignorance. If you're going to sell guns, you should have at least a minimal knowledge about them. All your proposals do NOTHING to prevent CRIMINAL access to guns and bump stocks.
2856 2018-03-01 12:51:01 That's odd. Our stocks might be low. We'll check and let you know asap!
2857 2018-03-01 12:50:56 Untrue, he can ban bump stocks ,improve the background systems and ensure military and others actually report arrests especially mental hygiene arrests.

2865 2018-03-01 12:47:52 @cspanwj Can't expect government to solve gun violence. Start at the source school and public security is forefront. Prepare and Prevent the main focus for schools. Bad actors will find a way so how can gun legislation alone prevent. Bump stocks are not sport or skill weapons.

2868 2018-03-01 12:46:17 Holy shit, I'm seriously so shocked that Trump is entirely for better gun control and banning of bump stocks. This is huge progress.
2869 2018-03-01 12:45:47 You're confused. Try this simpler version:

Stop selling assault sticks, bump stick stocks and high capacity acorn magazines.

(Notice there's no mention of other types of sticks. Also no mention of closing gun factories).

2877 2018-03-01 12:43:52 Altogether yes, but if you separate them on sectors or floats, you get different results. To me is important sectors and floats cause I see some really different stats in stocks behaviour. I track runners for 5 days with nice long-term chart (short strategy).
2878 2018-03-01 12:43:46 @NewDay @RepKinzinger seems quite reasonable on the topic of new gun laws, like age min. & bump stocks.  It must be inserted that if a car is transferred from father to son, the registration must be transferred.
2879 2018-03-01 12:43:38 The keys to Make America Safe Again are: 1. Ban & criminalize the sale & carry of all assault weapons; 2. Adopt universal background checks; 3. Ban bump stocks; 4. Prohibit gun sales to under 21, felons, & mentally ill DO IT!

I have used bump stocks I personally think they are unreliable gimmicks but its the perception of what they are doing and all the videos
2884 2018-03-01 12:42:16 no one is worried. Just look at AMZN BA NFLX. Cramer says buy BA lol. Tells me we have a day of reckoning with these stocks.
2885 2018-03-01 12:41:53 So, making the age for getting a gun at 21 and banning bump-stocks is disarming?

2893 2018-03-01 12:37:18 Require universal background checks. Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases. Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. It's not that hard.
2894 2018-03-01 12:36:56 Yes they are our own home grown terrorist organization! They own the Republican Party!  If Trump would actually ban AR-15, raise age limit, ban bump stocks, and enforce background checks and I would be totally shocked! Please trump do this for our safety!!

2897 2018-03-01 12:33:57 @realDonaldTrump So looking forward to seeing you sign an executive order banning bump stocks.  Keep pushing Congress to adopt universal background checks & an assault weapons ban for which there are NO constitutional protections.

2907 2018-03-01 12:29:39 There's a random guy in stocks as well. What's his story?
2908 2018-03-01 12:29:27 Look on the web site. He doesn’t run any money. He’s not described as part of the team just a founder in 2007. 

EM funds rarely short. It’s very hard to short illiquid stocks. 

And the UK isn’t  yet an EM!!!
2909 2018-03-01 12:29:13 @fox8news Tell Stacey Frey that in her last report she made two statements that were not accurate.  1. Bump stocks do not turn rifles into 'machine guns'.  2. DICK'S stopped selling AR-15's a couple of years ago.  Announcement yesterday applied only to 35 Field & Stream stores.
2910 2018-03-01 12:29:12 Means a lot brother...All I do is try and help people for free!!!..

And it's been nothing but winners
2911 2018-03-01 12:28:56 Shoulda gone crypto, not stocks.
2912 2018-03-01 12:28:02 I knew he would say/do something like this. When he was suddenly ok banning bump stocks to due to public pressure, I knew he’d cave to anything else given enough pressure.
2913 2018-03-01 12:27:46 My friends & I are military historians, we collect military firearms antique to modern, we are nonviolent respectful people! Semi-auto military weapons are hard to get due to import laws already wrongly in place. We oppose BANS but believe in strict laws, bump stocks are not guns
2914 2018-03-01 12:27:03 Vast majority of Americans want extended background checks, waiting periods, age limits for purchasing guns/ammo, bans of military style long guns and bump stocks. None of those violate 2A.
2915 2018-03-01 12:26:43 I don't care where or what you are. You are repeating the exact talking points of right wingers, and it's bullshit. I live here. My state has among the strongest gun laws in the country and the lowest incidents of gun-related crimes. Nobody here needs bump stocks & semiautomatic
2916 2018-03-01 12:26:11 Sorry, this is factually incorrect. Bump stocks allow you to pull the trigger once, unload the entirety of the magazine in a few seconds. The only difference between this and a real "machine gun" is this is done by the rifle moving which resets the trigger
2917 2018-03-01 12:25:22 Great headline! Make sure your 401K's are not invested in gun stocks. Call Fidelity or Vanguard and asked to be moved to the "socially conscious" funds they offer. #NRABoycott

2919 2018-03-01 12:24:30 1) pretty much everyone is ok with bump stock bans. 2) that ROF is still nowhere near full auto. And much less accurate. 3) bump stocks can be used on almost all semi-auto rifles, not just ARs

2923 2018-03-01 12:23:18 Ban assault weapons.
Raise the age to legally purchase.
Keep guns OUT of school.
Ban high capacity magazines.
Ban bump stocks.

2924 2018-03-01 12:23:08 Not sure making “you so ugly” comments helps in the discussion over sensible gun control.  I personally would have chosen a different platform, say banning bump stocks, but that’s me.  However, thank you for participating in discussion.  Gold star for you.

2927 2018-03-01 12:22:45 Right.  Bump Stocks is simply a "gee-whiz' waste of lead.  And NO, this is NOT Trump's backing off his @NRA support.  It is, at last, a mature way to END THIS STUPID GUN DEBATE, once and for all.  The Left goads The Right, and the Right stupidly lets the Left drive the debate.
2928 2018-03-01 12:22:42 I’ll tell you right now changing the age and banning bump stocks does absolutely nothing to protect our children!  The fbi allowed this to happen!  #DrainTheSwamp
2929 2018-03-01 12:22:39 There was an article in our paper a while back about a couple who put 75% of their salaries every month in a savings account and stocks, to become 'financially independent' by the time they're 40.
2930 2018-03-01 12:22:16 Powell is being perceived as hawkish with not as much concern for stocks. Today he can confirm that or retrace his steps. This should help provide short term direction
2931 2018-03-01 12:22:02 Ooh I'm interested in trying some of these! Who stocks them?
2932 2018-03-01 12:21:54 When you stop basing your trades off FOMO/bordem and stop the "could've, would've, should've" thinking, things start to fall in place a little easier #DayTrading #Trader #stocks $nvax $snap $twtr
2933 2018-03-01 12:21:53 I think..keeping stocks for 10 to 20 yrs is passe!

2935 2018-03-01 12:21:30 hello :) do you still have stocks of this?
2936 2018-03-01 12:21:06 Wal-Mart stocks have been steadily falling for quite awhile now. They rose a little bit in Jan. But they have been on a down swing. Since the shooting however they dropped from nearly 100 to 90. So alienating 5mil legal gun owners from buying a product seems like a bad move
2937 2018-03-01 12:19:57 Is this Pennsylvania Church;'s motto "@NRA & God We Trust"? @realDonaldTrump doesn't understand the regional problems of Gun Control and yesterday made promises that I equate to his on #DACA.  I give him 3 days and he'll have changed his mind on even Bump Stocks.
2938 2018-03-01 12:19:05 I don’t care one bit about Clinton. My IRA and stocks are smiling.  Taxes are a part of life.  And I think the reason bring up the Clintons is bc he is vile and she is also yet they are still adored. It’s sick. This past election didn’t have the most ethical options. Either side
2939 2018-03-01 12:19:02 You can have mine if you want it. Looks so pretty but being stuck in is losing its appeal as the wine stocks deplete! 
2940 2018-03-01 12:18:09 @jackconsidineMN I support your bill to ban bump stocks. Thank you! #GunControl
2941 2018-03-01 12:17:19 Good presentation on how to build a safe asset - divide based on ECB capital key, not on outstanding stocks of debt. This leads to pretty different ratings implications. Model also assumes senior tranche is 70%, and no default unless all 19 euro area countries default at once
2942 2018-03-01 12:17:06 It also gives false hope to those with little to no experience in acting. Those who hope to learn and grow as an actor. Auditions should be free.
2943 2018-03-01 12:16:45 Let's talk about "The Art of the Deal" . You take away bump stocks so let me buy a suppressor. It takes 6-12 months to buy a suppressor, why
2944 2018-03-01 12:16:24 #Investing - Global funds cut stocks to three-month low after turbulent February, Hedge funds are betting billions on more pain for HM, Three big name stocks hedge funds are buying right now Global funds cut stocks to three-month low after turbulent February From Reuters…
2945 2018-03-01 12:15:56 if a corporation had the drama and dysfunction that's evident in our white house the organization would be imperiled, its stocks would nosedive, the board would demand the ceo's resignation
2946 2018-03-01 12:15:01 shortage of old stocks + stocks of new cards + any price => people will buy since no alternative for high end card would be available. gotta love capitalism!
2947 2018-03-01 12:14:43 So basically you won't do a damn thing! As fucking usual! Keep guns away from school and away from people with mental dissabilities. Do some gun control like ban high capacity magazines ban assault weapons ban bump stocks right now
2948 2018-03-01 12:14:08 @CNN Vegas Shooting Should have been when you banned bump stocks 
Church Shooting Should have been when you strengthen background checks
Parkland SCHOOL SHOOTING Should be you banning assault rifles which are NOT used for hunting they are used by our troops to kill 
SAVE OUR KIDS
2949 2018-03-01 12:13:58 Retail a little too complacent.  Been told both stocks and bonds can’t go down together.
2950 2018-03-01 12:13:52 More raving from Knight on this issue. Bump stocks are irrelevant, and increasing the age to purchase guns for youngsters? Big deal. I don’t see any massive attack on gun ownership rights here. It’s always a freak out.
2951 2018-03-01 12:13:06 Some good stocks ..Dahan hogaye hai...
2952 2018-03-01 12:12:58 So you are saying the speculators who had been pushing these stocks higher. Not only don't understand about valuations. They also don't get  geographic boundaries.
2953 2018-03-01 12:12:53 BAN MILITARY ASSAULT WEAPONS, BUMP STOCKS,  SILENCERS.  PUT BACK @BarackObama BILL OF BANNING SALE OF WEAPONS TO MENTALLY DISABLED (which you revoked), ROLL BACK SALE OF GUNS TO 21 years!
2954 2018-03-01 12:12:46 We can't read a person mind.  We can limit access to clips, bump stocks, AR-15.  Keep blame mental health if if makes you feel better
2955 2018-03-01 12:12:07 Would you prefer he did what all presidents since Reagan has done...nothing at least he is prepared to ban bump stocks and new ideas...what did the previous presidents do? What? NOTHING
2956 2018-03-01 12:12:03 In 2015 they stopped selling sport rifles and AR-15s, bump stocks, high capacity magazines and similar accessories.
2957 2018-03-01 12:11:29 So are you going to push for the following to protect students?

1. Ban all Military style assault weapons 
2. Ban bump stocks 
3. Ban Large capacity magazines 
4. Full & COMPLETE background checks for all purchasing guns
2958 2018-03-01 12:11:20 OK. First Trump was calling for arming school teachers. He was against (or refused to discuss) banning assault weapons. Didn't act on banning bump stocks. Now he's calling for taking away guns BEFORE due process? Every time he speaks without a prompter it's 'Night At The Improv'.
2959 2018-03-01 12:10:57 Removed $EVHC from list of Purple Chip stocks as it no longer meets our earnings quality criteria.
2960 2018-03-01 12:10:56 2 months after new Fed Chair Greenspan stocks took gas in 1987
2961 2018-03-01 12:10:11 Thanks for that!  I guess that’s why they cancelled.  There is a special session today though at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee that should help keep blood stocks up @givebloodscot
2962 2018-03-01 12:10:06 No idea I don’t analyze stocks :(
2963 2018-03-01 12:09:55 Do you have the first clue on sensible gun laws or do you need to get updated talking points from Hannity? Stop pandering to the @NRA.  You said it already, ban military assault weapons & bump stocks.  Increase age limit to 21.  Stop talking & get going.
2964 2018-03-01 12:09:52 Got no stocks but listen to pied piper, it might help u girl 
2965 2018-03-01 12:09:37 Lol and their stocks fell over 2% after releasing that.
2966 2018-03-01 12:09:36 Bump stocks do not convert semi-auto to full-auto, in case facts mean anything to you.

Bump stocks do not alter the firing mechanism in any way, which is why the Obama Administration approved them.

They are perfectly legal under current law. Don't like it, pass a NEW LAW.
2967 2018-03-01 12:09:25 Thanks for sharing 
2968 2018-03-01 12:08:47 This sounds similar to what happens in the vaccine industry.  Persons on boards approving vaccines for our kids happen to hold stocks in the company's creating the vaccines.
2969 2018-03-01 12:08:17 Don't care about Dicks and if your only issue w/AR 15s is bump stocks by all means ban the stocks. :-D
2970 2018-03-01 12:08:10 Btw. I don’t want to take your guns. I DO want what >80% of NRA & GOP want: •Universal background checks •48-hr waiting period •ban on assault, semi-assault, bump stocks and anything that renders such more deadly. FYI:My dad was 20+ yrs USMC. 6 tours in ‘Nam.
2971 2018-03-01 12:07:40 Gun violence restraining order, age 21 to purchase, complete ban on bump stocks, complete background checks including private sale and gun show/internet sale, don’t arm teachers, limit magazine/clip capacity. Please. Courage. Do what’s right.
2972 2018-03-01 12:07:12 Short selling all bread stocks and going long on sun cream investments. #BeastFromTheEast
2973 2018-03-01 12:05:36 You are already backpedaling, raise the minimum age to purchase guns, ban Bump stocks and Automatic rifles.
Introducing more guns is not the solution.
Please lead with intelligence and not with the extreme wing of your base.
2974 2018-03-01 12:05:34 "...and in the future algorithms and robots will buy and sell stocks for you through ETF's so you can be more productive with your time."
2975 2018-03-01 12:05:27 Let's make a trade.  We offer 18 year olds the right to purchase guns for a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks.
2976 2018-03-01 12:05:15 Nottingham City Council where are your gritters?..Have you run out of all stocks? Road conditions are getting worst. All drivers be careful guys!!!
2977 2018-03-01 12:05:15 I'll call it stupid money buying on stupid reason. This news is already known & steel stocks been selling off, so dumb $ buying. Trade war is not good. This bid will turn into a bust. YTD data show you demand for steel likely to be lower.
2978 2018-03-01 12:04:20 Obama was that loophole. You know it.He is the one who made bump stocks legal.Stop playing stupid(OOPS.ROO LATE) to the mess Obama created. He just said the all it takes is an exec order.Obuma said he couldnt to anything about it. YOURE ALL LIARS!!
2979 2018-03-01 12:04:07 Stocks look overvalued. Ye olde prices to earnings thong - been around a long time, and right now?  BIG correction with rising interest rates.
2980 2018-03-01 12:03:59 Hi Nicola. NHS colleague here faced with unploughed roads from West Kilbride to the IRH yesterday and today. 2.5 hours to reach work. Staff stuck overnight and we ran out of food stocks. Passed several ploughs today not actually ploughing! PLEASE get them moving!!!
2981 2018-03-01 12:03:45 By association, these companies are endorsing the gun lobby's practices of halting sensible gun safety legislation, such as universal background checks and a ban on bump stocks, that would ultimately make our communities safer. As shareholders, customers and citizens,
2982 2018-03-01 12:03:23 He is, that’s my issue. With where the S+P is I would expect stocks to return closer to 4% over the next ten years.
2983 2018-03-01 12:03:18 I feel like I’m living in bizarro world. People complaining about the new tax policy passed in Dec & now people complaining about Trump wanting to raise the age to buy guns & ban bump stocks.  Take the win People. #bizarre #Trump
2984 2018-03-01 12:03:15 Eso es complicado, eh... La única manera sería alargar mucho más los stocks, para que quien lo quiera lo pueda  obtener y así se le chafe la reventa al especulador a corto plazo, que es lo que buscan casi todos. Pero claro, la compañía se arriesga a no vender el stock y...
2985 2018-03-01 12:03:00 Ban all Military style assault weapons, ban bump stocks, ban large capacity magazines,  FULL & COMPLETE background checks for all!
2986 2018-03-01 12:02:58 #PollOfTheWeek
Is this a good time to buy PSU Stocks?
2987 2018-03-01 12:02:23 I liked his comment that bump stocks make a LEGAL gun ILLEGAL. So true!
2988 2018-03-01 12:02:05 I don't agree w/ Trump on much but his forceful stances on bump stocks, and on telling congress to drop the concealed carry provision of the bill they're working on made me a little hopeful on this one.
2989 2018-03-01 12:01:46 How about our oyster stout Pearl Jet? Or there are some final stocks of our cherry stout Cherry Head available at the moment.
2990 2018-03-01 12:01:07 You appear to think that Brits take any notice of your own and #Major's ramblings. We don't. You're both laughing stocks with their snouts stuck firmly on the Brussels trough
2991 2018-03-01 12:00:46 Trump does not have any mental illness. And may I ask what's wrong with lower taxes and a more secure border. I'm so confused on why liberals think Trump's racist and is going to ruin the economy. Ever look at the stocks?
2992 2018-03-01 11:59:51 It’s those Nanjarian Brothers on CNBC that do all the “unusual call activity“ on Stocks and pump them to you  to buy them
2993 2018-03-01 11:59:46 Stopping bump stocks won’t help. Especially since most shootings are by pistols. Protect our constitution and 2 amendment Mr @POTUS. We know you transcend parties but, have to appease them. I am bigger than the state and am my own sovereign @jeremyscahill
2994 2018-03-01 11:59:45 In all humility Sir...there no reason to TomTom abt it...lets see for how long & its sustainability.These r very temporary phenomenons...our fundamentals r far too fragile to write home much abt.
We all r proud Indians but lets not b frivolous & become laughing stocks.

2995 2018-03-01 11:59:32 Yields and stocks seem to be pointing more towards a sharp economic slowdown than 4 rate hikes in a roaring economy
2996 2018-03-01 11:58:47 Guns don’t belong in schools. What is the lesson you teach children & the population?  That you’re too weak to stand up to the NRA and put forth reasonable gun laws to ban assault weapons of war, bump stocks, & impose a age requirement of 21. #NeverAgain
2997 2018-03-01 11:58:29 Stocks to watch: WPP, Burberry, Laird, Ahold  #Stocks #BoomorBust
2998 2018-03-01 11:58:28 Glad you are banning the bump stocks. Background checks and mental health issues very important.
2999 2018-03-01 11:57:31 I don't often disagree with you, but I do here. A bump stock is just a mechanism to convert a semi-auto to full auto, which is already illegal. 

You could argue that a ban on full auto violates the 2nd Amendment, but if full auto is banned, then bump stocks violate that ban.
3000 2018-03-01 11:57:29 No more selling of murder weapons with high capacity. Raise the age, ban assault weapons, universal background checks, no more bump stocks. @DICKS @Walmart Thanks for showing courage to lead the way.
3001 2018-03-01 11:57:26 I nearly died when I heard your ideas raise the age, take guns from dangerous people (only give them back after they’ve been cleared) getting rid of bump stocks your the #republicans and #nra must really love you right now! #guncontrol
3002 2018-03-01 11:57:12 @snapchatsupport are you kidding around with this update now? I mean it’s nearly been a month, 1,500,000 people want the old one back, your stocks have fallen and yet you’re STILL not turning it back? Are you insane?
3003 2018-03-01 11:57:01 you are still for banning bump stocks&raising the purchase age to 21 -right? Or did the @NRA & @GOP Force you to back down?
3004 2018-03-01 11:57:01 Et bien cela fera de bons  sujets pour les chaines d'infos , les radios et JP Pernot.Ils ont leurs stocks pour une semaine au moins.

3008 2018-03-01 11:55:02 Think oil stocks are ok here?

3010 2018-03-01 11:54:42 POTUS please don't have a knee jerk reaction to the tragedy in Fl. Bump stocks had NOTHING to do with this tragedy. The school, the local law officials, and the FBI ALL dropped the ball, BIG TIME. Address these issues FIRST.
3011 2018-03-01 11:53:30 As long the stocks are available!

3015 2018-03-01 11:51:09 Ok...were you familiar with bump stocks before Vegas shooting?
3016 2018-03-01 11:50:20 WW1 and WW2 were mass shootings and we built armies to eliminate WW3-but protective gear and people in school is shunned and bump stocks are banned-soundslike a plan
3017 2018-03-01 11:49:47 Trump claimed that he didn't need congress, he could ban Bump Stocks anytime he wants! So Why the hell hasn't he? It's been 5 months since the slaughter in Nevada!   #NeverAgain !
3018 2018-03-01 11:49:46 It's the start of the apocalypse I'm telling you.
The end comes not with a bang but with a mild shrug at a lack of 57 herbs and spices...
3019 2018-03-01 11:48:23 This group demonstrates to reasonable gun owners, like myself, that assault rifles and bump stocks really need to be banned. #BanAssaultWeapons
3020 2018-03-01 11:46:29 @JimCramer17 Good morning Jim! We thank you for your rigorous work on the Stock Market. What would be your take on the five top growth stocks/companies?
3021 2018-03-01 11:44:15 “84% of stocks are held by the wealthiest 10% of households” What about mutual funds held in retirement accounts?
3022 2018-03-01 11:43:51 3% of what? Your first €30.000,- (savings, stocks, crypto and second homes) is exluded from wealth tax. From €30.000,- you’ll pay 0,60% wealth tax and that percentage increases with the value of your assets up to a maximum of 1,61% (percentages for 2018).
3023 2018-03-01 11:43:37 Banning bump stocks is yet another example of masturbatory politics.

Feels good to those who engage in it, but accomplishes nothing.

You can make one yourself, or accomplish the same thing by other means.

No one who would use a bump stock to commit a crime will be deterred.
3024 2018-03-01 11:43:19 Okay but I imagine those 10 stocks where considered higher risk than most and would not be inside the profile of the average investor. Point taken though as there is no right answer.
3025 2018-03-01 11:43:09 Absolutely. All University Alumni should contact the director of Pensions and Endowments at their respective alma mater and demand divestment from gun manufacturer stocks.  #NeverAgainMSD
3026 2018-03-01 11:42:25 Please be honest with your constituents  This legislation is a gigantic tax cut for corporations  and the wealthy  The middle class has seen little in the way of tax cuts but co shareholders and ceos are realizing billions in buy-outs of stocks

3031 2018-03-01 11:40:21 @realDonaldTrump with you take a anti-gun stance on the AR15 & bump fire stocks I will not be voting for you in 2020 for re-election. We the legal fire owner of the United States are fed up with our constitutional rights being curtailed.
3032 2018-03-01 11:39:08 It's impossible to get any conclusion tracking just around 20 stocks. I have at the moment 142 stocks in my data and still think it's not enough. Well if you want to see my data, let me know. Good luck.
3033 2018-03-01 11:38:32 No they haven't you idiot - we're still members of the EU. The EU is doing very well at the moment. Beginning to bite now, Toys'R'Us, Maplins as retailers run out of stocks bought before the referendum
3034 2018-03-01 11:38:03 @realDonaldTrump #TrumpFamilyScamBill benefits the rich, they are manipulating the stock market, by buying their  stocks back.
3035 2018-03-01 11:37:58 Fear not children, all is well at Eye HQ. I haven’t been to the notorious Garratt Lane Sainsbury’s for several days - the sight of empty shelves would only make me angry. My stocks are dwindling somewhat, but I think there’s still half a spoonful of pearl barley in the Eye pantry
3036 2018-03-01 11:37:42 So Liberals are attacking our President Trump for saying he would ban bump stocks even if Congress doesnt. they say if obama had done it that impeachment wouldve happened. They are forgetting what obama did by illegally changing a law (ACA) and with immigration illegally.

You guys should be marching to Washington with torches!
3039 2018-03-01 11:35:24 I somewhat agree except the dollar was stronger just a year ago and Fed was still doing QE. The main problem is that all this money creation pops up in the form of overvalued stocks and high home prices which makes buying a home very difficult for the average joe.

3041 2018-03-01 11:34:11 Love your stuff but I don’t get you on this Ben. I think they’re only talking about banning bump-stocks and denying access to guns to the mentally ill? Is that such a bad thing? I see it as taking steps to try and save lives, not as a threat from ‘big brother’.Correct me if wrong

3043 2018-03-01 11:32:07 In my experience what seems like 'common sense' legislation, eg bump stocks, never result in a single item piece of legislation. That's not how things work apparently in DC. Everybody wants something attached to any piece of legislation for their own special interests. (1 of 2)

3053 2018-03-01 11:27:02 What makes a rifle an assult rifle is not the size of the rifle, but the fact that you can hold the trigger down and can keep unloading rounds. This does not describe an AR15 at all and butt stocks does not make your gun into an automatic neither. #guneducation #NRA #pplkillppl

3120 2018-03-01 10:38:25 Bump Stocks, AR, High Capacity Clips, those three are now the focus of preventing shootings from happening again and again. I think we should focus on stopping a shooter or shooters from doing it. We can’t? How about being able to get a gun, any gun? Can’t?

3159 2018-03-01 10:07:21 @realDonaldTrump POTUS is asking Congress to ban Bump Stocks and raise semi automatic rifle age to 21, who does that hurt? Democrats bc it takes the gun issue off the table for good. Background checks also that we all favor. He plays 3D chess while others play checkers.

3170 2018-03-01 09:58:04 I think raising the age to 21 for assault-style rifles is a good idea, you have to be 21 to buy a handgun. They both can do equal amounts of damage and should be on the same playing field. Getting rid of bump stocks is a great idea, they make rifles fire at a faster rate.
3171 2018-03-01 09:57:50 The border wall is just something he said to get some old style Democrats and Republicans on his side. What is funny is that Obama didn't ban bump stocks but Trump did and he really is talking about taking guns. He knows what both sides want.

3176 2018-03-01 09:56:23 That is really sad. Speculating on crypto is no different than speculating on penny stocks.

Crypto is about a gamechanging new technology that enables transactions or entire programs to happen in a trustless and distributed way!

3188 2018-03-01 09:50:00 Probably they can't brag on the profits made during a bear phase of the market.
Personally I don't mind a bear phase as it a discount sale in the market for some good businesses. Some of my best returns have come from stocks bought during a bear market.

3230 2018-03-01 09:20:07 The difference between an AR-15 and am M-16 is 3-round burst mode.

Said Burst Mode is rarely used by the military, as it really just wastes ammo, while destroying accuracy.

Also, both will fire single shots as fast as you can pull the trigger. Which is why bump stocks work.

3257 2018-03-01 08:52:41 Tomorrow he will have flipped after the NRA reminded him of how much $$$ they gave him to grt him elected.He will sign an executive order on bump stocks that will turn out to be unimplementable and puddle around with background checking etc

3280 2018-03-01 08:33:28 technically bump stocks don't actually increase the rate of fire nor does anything else because the guns can only cycle at 1 speed. and the results of a bump stock are easily replicated with just a trigger finger. they are a novelty item at best.

3290 2018-03-01 08:23:40 Over 20 stocks hit fresh 52-week highs Today,,
3291 2018-03-01 08:23:31 Q is not posting. All q pages going down. Trump taking bump stocks and other things and fighting with sessions again. Looks grim. Distraction? I pray.
3292 2018-03-01 08:23:15 pf two months in was 35% up end of Jan now 20% up end of Feb no trading just holding think those gains and more will be made up on my chosen stocks.
3293 2018-03-01 08:23:04 I think getting rid of bump stocks, raising the age to buy,  better backgroung checks and a few days waiting time it's reasonable. 
We better be glad is not crooked. They would have found a way to confiscate.
3294 2018-03-01 08:22:03 Haha :D j’espère que les stocks ne seront pas épuisés !!
3295 2018-03-01 08:21:07 In 2017 10 stocks accounted for over 50% of the growth in the S&P 500. So depending how un/diverse your portfolio is either could be true.

3408 2018-03-01 07:01:28 Bump stocks and slide stocks don’t make AR-15s automatic, just a lot easier to shoot faster. If an AR was automatic then it’d be an M4. It’s a grey area on what an “assault rifle” actually is specifically

3415 2018-03-01 06:56:52 And how is it doing better exactly? The stock market is not a good indicator of the economy as we saw Trump refuse to mention the days stocks took a mass nosedive. As for the business outlook, this coming from what? Corporations or the actual working majority?

- 2017 was best yr since 2003

3461 2018-03-01 06:34:37 this was a good meeting! I hope he follows through! #nomoreguns #GunReformNow He has said no more bump stocks, raising the age and confiscating guns! He is not worried about @nra

3533 2018-03-01 05:43:18 @realDonaldTrump I support your ban on bump stocks mostly. I support raising the age to 21 to buy a gun, I support a requirement to have gun owners go through the process of getting concealed permit to own a gun. That one was me. Make something happen since no one else will
3534 2018-03-01 05:43:16 Many people first heard about bump stocks b/c of what happened here in Vegas.  If they bothered to keep researching they'd know you don't even need the device.
3535 2018-03-01 05:42:31 Why do we need a "Deal" at all?  The Parkland shooting was a law enforcement failure from beginning to end -  FBI and Sheriff Israel.  So why would you be throwing in bump stocks, more intrusive background checks, and throwing out reciprocal carry?
3536 2018-03-01 05:41:42 same applies to stocks. U don't get into a Trap Stock !

3538 2018-03-01 05:40:56 His were only semi automatic but with a bump stock and not nearly what a similarly looking military weapon would have done. Even with bump stocks an actual assault rifle fires much faster.

3541 2018-03-01 05:39:00 I have recently subscribed to #Tradervue. Awesome platform for trade stats. Does not support #ASX stocks but have found a way to import data to get around. If interested let me know
3542 2018-03-01 05:38:31 A 6 hour period? You must not know much about stocks.
3543 2018-03-01 05:36:30 I am saying the future returns of stocks and bonds is unknowable...period. Of course if you know ahead of time the returns af A and B, AND the sequence of those returns, you have useful info.  You don’t. Returns will be what they are going to be. Unknowable.
3544 2018-03-01 05:36:28 Universal background checks, mandatory cooling off periods, banning of assault weapons and bump stocks, closing existing loopholes regarding gun shows etc would achieve alot. The 2015 reform package that Congress voted down should be revisited.
3545 2018-03-01 05:36:12 “Never have and  never will sell bump stocks” .... well yea I’d hope so considering they’re illegal.. 
3546 2018-03-01 05:36:05 Where I Stand

Raise the age to buy a rifle to 21? NO
Ban Bump Stocks? NO
PPOs without due process? NO
3547 2018-03-01 05:35:41 We had hearings on SB707/HB888 to ban Bump Stocks /RapidFireTriggerActivators & SB1036 to have a process for domestic abusers to surrender their guns-Thx to lead sponsors @Ramirez4PG2018 @DavidMoon2014 @Willcsmithjr & @gunviolenceprev @MomsDemand @NAACPMD faith leaders, advocates

3549 2018-03-01 05:34:35 If we can just outlaw bump stocks and grenade launchers the shootings will stop
3550 2018-03-01 05:34:32 All semantics. Bump stocks are not good. Period.
3551 2018-03-01 05:34:31 The real problem with gun violence is not about mental hospitals, armed teachers, bump stocks or age requirements. The real problem is that there are far too many firearms in America — more than 300 million.
3552 2018-03-01 05:34:08 @ZeeBusiness I have idea 250 shares @111. Should I add more stocks Sarfraz Vanoo
3553 2018-03-01 05:33:49 Auto sales have done very well whole of 2017. Even large companies like Maruti, TaMo, M&M, Hero, Bajaj, Ashok Leyland etc have grown at mid to high teens in most months. Auto stocks have done very well for investors like me.
3554 2018-03-01 05:33:35 But didn’t their stocks go down a lot because of an announcement like this recently... went down over 35% I think
3555 2018-03-01 05:32:34 The real problem with gun violence is not about mental hospitals, armed teachers, bump stocks or age requirements. The real problem is that there are far too many firearms in America — more than 300 million.

3557 2018-03-01 05:32:06 Bump Stocks Are an Illusion!
A Boogie Monster Created By The Left Anti Gun Movement!
Along With The FakeNews Media!
I Agree Ability To AIM Shoot With Bump Stock Is Overrated!

3563 2018-03-01 05:28:53 #MULTIBAGGERSTOCKS : Now, try to assess which 5 stocks out of the 10 good stocks have greater potential to grow in coming 3 years. You must gather all possible news from the web on these sectors and companies for this purpose, read them, assess them and select them
3564 2018-03-01 05:28:29 He is forcing the dems hand. Took bump stocks out so they can't come up with only that. DACA 2
3565 2018-03-01 05:28:15 That's not how it works. ETFs can be made of any collection of stocks its owner chooses. And S&P only manages indexes *that they manage,* like the S&P 500.

Hell I know the owner of an ETF for the video game industry. Vanguard may very well control the securities in this fund.
3566 2018-03-01 05:28:10 You guys should know by now Apple is releasing new iPhones—every eight to nine months— just to raise their stocks up.

3568 2018-03-01 05:27:31 Lol...I know she's tweeting about bump stocks. Trump getting rid of them...he's right NRA got Congress by the balls, sadly his inner Saddam came out today...
3569 2018-03-01 05:26:46 #MULTIBAGGERSTOCKS : India has over 4000 listed stocks. So, selecting 10 good stocks out of them should not be a difficult task. Now, if the companies have done well in last 3 years, their market price will be reasonably high.
3570 2018-03-01 05:26:38 Don't worry Trump wants to take your guns now! Didn't you see the Brietbart (the Peckerwood Bible) headline?

"Trump the Gun Grabber: Cedes Dems’ Wish List— Bump Stocks, Buying Age, ‘Assault Weapons,’ Background Checks…"
3571 2018-03-01 05:26:38 he's only offering what the bra deems ok. they do t care about age limits, someone else will buy the guns. bump stocks don't matter. putting armed guards or teachers, that's a paycheck to them.
3572 2018-03-01 05:25:59 Bump stocks? Nothing.  But is there reason to have them in a civilized society?
3573 2018-03-01 05:25:06 #MULTIBAGGERSTOCKS : SELECT  at least 10 good stocks which have grown their net sales and net profits, in last 3 years. Be unbiased in selecting these 10 good stocks.
3574 2018-03-01 05:25:01 Illegals will out gun us when gun stocks are illegal people there is no border control you can't control within because the border is freely open we are doomed people
3575 2018-03-01 05:24:50 And of course the really rich don't pay salary taxes and since most of their income comes from stocks and dividends it's fixed at the long term capital gains tax rate, which used to be 15%. Like Hedge Fund managers making over $1 billion a year.
3576 2018-03-01 05:24:39 You are negative about almost all the stocks. I wonder what does your portfolio have. Can you tweet about the stocks you're positive about?
3577 2018-03-01 05:24:28 The AR15 doesn’t require accuracy. It is a point and shoot machine designed to kill people. Even without bump stocks, the velocity of the bullet is extremely destructive, moreso than any 9mm. The chances of survival drop disturbingly as it is so well designed for its purpose
3578 2018-03-01 05:23:01 Wake up mexico controls America through drugs the cartel has already taken over California is full and they are migrating further in we are doomed if these people aren't made to go back guns are coming across that border they will bring what ever is illegal with them gun stocks?

3586 2018-03-01 05:20:05 Serious question regarding people  who support bump stocks & assault rifles, including the ability of 18 year olds to buy them: Could people like that pass a full psych evaluation? I don't think so. Require full psych eval for guns... Problem solved?  #GunControl #CNN #NRA

3588 2018-03-01 05:18:48 unbelievable , still stunned especially the executive order he plans on signing to ban bump stocks,thought those days were behind us ! @realDonaldTrump
3589 2018-03-01 05:18:32 FACT,---laws can ban.  Fact the democrats have a bill which can become a law which Will ban bump stocks which Is better than guess what?  Better than not banning bump stocks.
3590 2018-03-01 05:17:14 yup 
he is taking the argument from them before they can use it
when it come time to write the bill those on the right will correct it but in meantime gets to insert mental ill that received voluntary treatment in background check and not even NRA want bump stocks

3595 2018-03-01 05:14:40 As pro gun #2ADefenders we need to use some basic common sense,, using devices that give our guns the ability to do something that is illegal without permits is not wise I know the argument bump stocks are not changing the mechanics of the gun so it really is legal
3596 2018-03-01 05:14:12 I don’t mind. Might b a good idea. I’ll die a 2nd amendment freak but I don’t see any use for bump stocks either

3600 2018-03-01 05:13:25 30 day wait period, the most THOROUGH background check in the world, a psych eval before you can buy ANY gun. Maybe a 15 or 20 wait period for a standard hunting rifle. Age limit for any gun is 21. Ban bump stocks and mags over 20-30 rounds for civilian use. #congress #GunControl
3601 2018-03-01 05:12:53 Safety should be PRIORITY ONE. Banning assault rifles and bump stocks & raising min age doesn't violate 2nd Amendment rights and would be a great start to SENSIBLE gun control. We need #KSBlueWave to vote you and your ilk out!!! #BanAssaultRifles #VetsForGunReform
3602 2018-03-01 05:12:42 I’m just spitballing before bed. But yeah, regulate ammo, improve mental health care, keep guns & ban bump stocks (duh). Goodnight.
3603 2018-03-01 05:11:52 @SenTomCotton @JohnBoozman can you please explain why President Trump is going to make people 21 to buy weapons, ban bump stocks, and take weapons away without due process? I’m no Republican but I believe in our Constitution.
3604 2018-03-01 05:11:23 Just hope the stocks still available by noon  only time can leave work
3605 2018-03-01 05:11:19 Just trying to get the govt to pass universal background checks, ban bump stocks, raise age to 21, and remove military grade weapons from citizens.  These mass murders can be stopped.
3606 2018-03-01 05:10:38 That ain’t the only thing going on either. There are 5 bills they are trying to push through in the IL legislature. Under 21 to own a semi-Auto rifle. Ban bump stocks/ trigger cranks, Mags/body armor, are the main ones. The bills are really obscure too. Final push to be like CA.
3607 2018-03-01 05:10:02 You don't want to be a mouse in an @NRA boardroom. You'd be shot at by a bunch of firearms with high capacity stocks. Granted, every shot would miss because the NRA can't aim (which is why they love their bullet-spray AF-15s), but it would be the scariest 5 seconds of your life.
3608 2018-03-01 05:09:58 Still don't think it's a good idea to ban bump stocks! You know liberals and you know they are never happy! Deep state is salivating at the precedence set. Very nasty people. Disgusting!
3609 2018-03-01 05:09:19 Markets cannot be timed. Future returns are unknowable. Thats why we simulate distributions of returns that represent economic realty. Whether stocks are over valued or undervalued is Irrelevant because it is unknowable.  Anticipate horrible -hope for decent.
3610 2018-03-01 05:09:09 We’ll see. The #2A isn’t negotiable or shouldn’t be. Pretty easy, if #POTUS enacts nothing I’ll vote for him again. If he bans bump stocks by EO or signs any gun control legislation I will not vote for him.
3611 2018-03-01 05:08:51 Are there any stocks you hate right now? I’m looking for some investment advice.
3612 2018-03-01 05:08:11 Bump stocks? Buy ‘em quick. That’s all. We already have laws on the books that nobody appears to follow. I do notice that the shooters are consistently Dems, though especially if you take into account ALL of the gun violence in the country. It is committed overwhelmingly BY DEMS.

3616 2018-03-01 05:06:27 Bump stocks give semi auto the ability to shoot AUTO and without permits is illegal SO lets see we have You Tube videos up the wazoo with HEY LOOK AT ME! shooting my semi Auto AR in full auto! We have enough problems this kinda shit is making it worse #2ADefenders
3617 2018-03-01 05:06:19 1)Bump stocks aren't guns.
2) I'm for banning bump stocks.
3) Dems are trying to pass a bill banning semi auto weapons. That's all weapons!
4) nobody will actually take my guns. They just make new ones illegal. I'll just get them without registration. Is that what you want?

3632 2018-03-01 05:00:06 All you can really do is start to bend that curve. And you can. The NRA doesn't support even the most simple of measures like closing the gun show loophole or even those silly fucking bump stocks.
3633 2018-03-01 05:00:03 That meeting wad an input from the attendees meeting. Asking questions to see the response back. He will do bump stocks,  rest will bounce around congress
3634 2018-03-01 04:59:56 The issue is not the gun lobby or the NRA or bump stocks.
The real issue is the demented people getting guns and being able to easily walk into a school and kill while armed deputies stand by and let this happen.
3635 2018-03-01 04:58:39 @DavidAFrench Or you could ban bump stocks. And ban assault weapons. Limit access to ammo. Ya know- protect kids. But you do you
3636 2018-03-01 04:58:29 Yes they are,while stocks last though I’m sure we are under the 15k mark.

3640 2018-03-01 04:57:25 With which violent occurrences are extremely rare. Bump stocks aside (for now) it is illegal to modify a weapon to make it full auto, and illegal to own  full auto. If firing pin mods can be used on any semi auto, why ban only cosmetically scary ones?

3642 2018-03-01 04:56:33 Executive order to ban bump stocks. That’s bad, 21 to buy firearms is worse. Seizing weapons, then going to court is absolutely too far.

3649 2018-03-01 04:53:08 Hey dumbazz.. Bump Stocks were used in one shooting. Most of the other shootings involved assault style weapons. Pull your head and the NRA out of your azz and see where the real problem is. 
3650 2018-03-01 04:52:35 Banning bump stocks will not solve anything.
Anyone can easily make their own bump stock.
Takes practice to use them and a big waste of ammo plus no accuracy.
Just saying this is a pointless ban....go ahead and ban it...will not solve anything.
3651 2018-03-01 04:51:28 It's not as "perfect" for stock earnings yields as it is for bond yields because stocks have more price and yield volatility. But it's a fine baseline.

3654 2018-03-01 04:49:53 Again...this is just total defensiveness on your part & no proposals of your own. 
You’re talking about “they”...who is “they”?  Some left wing nut somewhere says repeal the 2nd & you take that as a serious proposal in Congress. They can’t even ban bump stocks ffs
3655 2018-03-01 04:49:32 above all stocks are fire sir
3656 2018-03-01 04:48:50 Why? Sounds pretty Trumpian to me..
3657 2018-03-01 04:48:13 Illegally I said, also I know I’m not gonna swing your opinion all they way around and visa versa. But shit like bump stocks I can say bye to, ridiculous capacities for magazines ok whatever. Going all out on a gun ban would not be pretty.
3658 2018-03-01 04:47:54 We need to follow up with real change. Ban bump stocks and assault rifles. Raise the age to 21. Comprehensive database on gun owners, longer wait periods. No guns for convicted violent offenders, domestic abusers. Stronger mental health support.

3662 2018-03-01 04:45:41 Would you care to point out EXACTLY where the Constitution guarantees the right to buy bump-stocks? Or run a gun store free from state licensing requirements? Or addresses ANY of the items passed today?
3663 2018-03-01 04:45:23 Dear Mr. @POTUS, I'm just a little person in the grand scheme of it all, but I did vote for u in 2016, I am seriously concerned abt what I heard today concerning gun restrictions, ban bump stocks ok doesn't matter, but I get concerned when u start discussing raising the age to
3664 2018-03-01 04:44:52 Arming teachers puts 500million to 1 billion more into gun manufacturers pockets . Bump stocks can be made with a file, does a person cure mental health issues by turning 21? THIS IS NOTHING
3665 2018-03-01 04:43:34 High capacity magazines are useless, as most times you will have one or two shots at the target at most. Bump stocks are designed to make it easier to kill more things a smaller time frame, making it much easier to gun down more people in a shooting.

3668 2018-03-01 04:41:45 So do you think bump stocks should be illegal? Is there a legal reason to need them other than for bad reasons? People are angry about them, but the way I see it, they are sold for a reason. I’m just wondering what that reason is.

3678 2018-03-01 04:37:37 The NRA had already proposed the bump stocks. I do have an issue with the kid saying the deputy wasn’t at fault for not going in then saying the governor was at fault for the deputy not going in (echoing his very progressive and activist parents)

3683 2018-03-01 04:31:58 I'm confused how bump stocks even made it to market as its sole purpose is to circumvent the law which bans fully automatic weapons.

3687 2018-03-01 04:30:15 The things offered by Trump as a form of gun reform are pathetic. Raise the age from 18 to 21 to purchase assault rifle, mental health care, bump stocks. Does this mean your mental illness cures itself when you reach 21?
3688 2018-03-01 04:28:19 The President already said he would take care of bump stocks with executive order your bill is a Democrat Trojan horse.

3691 2018-03-01 04:27:01 How many people have bump stocks killed? I’d love to see an official number! And since we have gotten 0 evidence from the Vegas shooting I don’t believe they were used! Evidence shows ISIS was involved coming from the southern border... stop that 1st! MAGA

About the best that can be done, to minimize the carnage, is to ban 
high capacity magazines / bump stocks.

3723 2018-03-01 04:13:14 I don't believe in the "Second Amendment As the Third Rail of Politics" strategy. I believe that we can raise the age of ownership of semi autos to 21. I refuse to make ANY changes to magazines, stocks, barrels, etc. That is just me and I am willing to debate it.
3724 2018-03-01 04:13:04 I hope your standing firm to our rights , the NRA teaches gun safety in fact it was a man with a AR15 who stopped Texas shooter . Its not the gun its the person.  and stronger background, mental healthy and even bum stocks I see but stand with our rights and 2cond amendment
3725 2018-03-01 04:11:57 War guns, bump stocks and armour plated bullets are necessary under your precious 2nd amendment? The whole world laughs at the US, you're being swindled on healthcare, wages and tax and you don't even realise it cos you spend yr time worrying about a 200 year old amendment

If Congress bans semi autos' I think you will see a new Congress next term'
I can see giving up bump stocks'and give into Background checks "
But not eliminating a whole class of weapons"

3744 2018-03-01 04:01:31 @realDonaldTrump 
Mr. President,
I normally would say don’t give an inch on gun control but, my suggestion is this time give a .25”. Instead of banning bump stocks make them NFA (National Firearms Act) items. Still available for xtra $200 tax and xtra checks.

3747 2018-03-01 03:59:54 Why didn't 45 strongly advocate banning the sale of bump stocks after the Las Vegas, NV mass shooting massacre?  By the way, why did he throw up bump stock when one wasn't involved in Parkland, FL. Why, to change the focus on assault weapons as a whole.

3756 2018-03-01 03:56:17 This is similar to, but not exactly the same as, his Muslim (Travel) ban. In this case the DOJ/ATF has already determined that the bump stocks are legal. There is no ban or authorization from Congress to ban the devices.  Thus Trump does not have the authority to ban bump stocks.

3768 2018-03-01 03:51:16 4) Specific weapons limited in # of shells. For example, AR 15 could only hold 10 max.
5) No bump stocks.
6) Weapons to be locked in house and need finger ID to open box
And I am in support of 2nd amendment, am not a NRA member but probably will join next time I am in US.

3773 2018-03-01 03:50:20 I can't handle @donlemon 2 weeks straight of "bitching" on @CNN about Trump/NRA donations to the campaign. Today Trump states plans banning of bump stocks, age restrictions, and better background checks. Lemon twists the headline to Trump wants to take your guns. Pass/aggr bitch.
3774 2018-03-01 03:50:03 Stocks
3775 2018-03-01 03:48:58 I think the current US narrative will cause a big bump in gun manufacturer’s stocks.
3776 2018-03-01 03:48:41 Why didn't 45 strongly advocate banning the sale of bump stocks after the Las Vegas, NV mass shooting massacre?  By the way, why did he throw up bump stock when one wasn't involved in Parkland, FL. Why, to change the focus on assault weapons as a whole.
3777 2018-03-01 03:48:39 i've been following Cheds for probably 2 years now...since i started playing in penny stocks lol. wanna talk about scam artists and manipulation?! i'll never go back to pennys after starting cryptos.
3778 2018-03-01 03:48:32 Auto stocks will be in focus as the auto companies will start announcing  monthly sales numbers for February 2018 from today, 1 March 2018.
3779 2018-03-01 03:47:44 Inappropriate? It's dumb as hell is what it is. He's Board Member of the NRA. So this asshole has an ulterior motive: sell more guns, and stop people from blaming semi automatic assault weapons with bump stocks.
3780 2018-03-01 03:47:26 Getting Congress to ban Bump Stocks (that was approved by the Obama Administration) and raise the age to buy Semi-Automatic Rifles (not regular rifles) to 21...who gets hurt? Nobody. Takes the "Gun" issue away from the Dems. POTUS plays 3D chess while others play checkers.
3781 2018-03-01 03:47:09 NO one cares about BUMP stocks. They were approved during Obama's term. Why? Setting this up? Do not whittle away at 2A. Remove gun free zones. Hire GUARDS or use teachers to protect our kids.Make people report to agencies those that need it.
3782 2018-03-01 03:46:38 Big result for Michael and Matthew Pitman with Montoya Star and Son Of Maher providing the quinella there at Hastings, picking the Montoya Star/Miss Wilson stocks for the Cuddle Stakes have just gone up.
3783 2018-03-01 03:46:12 Not a huge fan of either but at-least Cramer is crazy smart.  Takes LIVE calls and people just list tickers of stocks and he knows ALL OF THEM.  Freaking nut. Lol
3784 2018-03-01 03:43:55 I've spent the last two hours looking over my finances, retirement fund, and reading about stocks and CDs trying to figure out the best way to invest and grow my funds. Faahhk I'm so lost.
3785 2018-03-01 03:43:54 I will say as in professional sports some teams will have peaks of + winning for numerous years while teams who aren’t winning/need patience until talent can return. Replenish the talent pool in a sense. As in stocks once it hits is peak it’ll go down and others will rise.
3786 2018-03-01 03:43:49 @sptulsian GRAPHITE STOCKS???????????? YOUR COMMENTS NOW.................................. "GET OUT OR STAY"
3787 2018-03-01 03:42:12 How about repealing the NFA? Why should I have to go through untold hoops to obtain a machine gun or an SBR? Bump stocks now, what next?
3788 2018-03-01 03:42:05 Mental health resources, waiting period when buying a gun, better background checks, no bump stocks. And to your next question, no, it doesn't stop a lunatic from doing something stupid. The point is, nothing totally fixes the problem.
3789 2018-03-01 03:41:48 I’ve heard top strategists claiming stocks move up and down. Big if true.
3790 2018-03-01 03:41:36 Soros threatened the Tech Left. I wonder how much of their stocks he owns?
3791 2018-03-01 03:40:34 ..would have occurred again. Then they'd be back pointing fingers at each other. I thought they took care of the Bump-Stocks after the...
3792 2018-03-01 03:40:16 @realDonaldTrump POTUS is taking the "gun" issue away from the Dems with minor moves. Bump stocks and raising the age to buy Simi-Automatic rifles...not regular rifles. Who's hurt? Nobody. He plays 3D chess while others play checkers.
3793 2018-03-01 03:40:03 Yes. 100%. Majority of vets will tell you bump stocks significantly worsen gun accuracy and are basically worthless.
3794 2018-03-01 03:39:56 I also dont like messing with age limits or getting rid of bump stocks will do one single thing to prevent the next mass shooting. We know those deaths occurred bc the gov agencies didnt follow thru. It had nothing to do with Cruz's age, or a bump stock.
3795 2018-03-01 03:39:47 Eyeing to catch #TORRENTPOWER in tons........................+++Many more stocks looking hot !!
FIRST 15 Minute low..........and grab it !!!Anything !!
3796 2018-03-01 03:39:37 trump knows only congress can outlaw bump stocks  this is bs
3797 2018-03-01 03:39:18 I'm not sure you know what bump stocks do
3798 2018-03-01 03:38:50 Lmao who cares about stocks that generate revenue and have valuable resources... sell that shit.. these motherfuckers just got a website. 
*for record not hating on GRAT. Know 0 on them* just ripping this guys pumps

3800 2018-03-01 03:38:13 If the law is strictly about bump stocks, great. Anything else it makes it a non-starter. Focus!
3801 2018-03-01 03:38:13 One thing you can count on...stocks will always move.
3802 2018-03-01 03:38:02 Action that includes controls on law-abiding citizens is the swamp. Bump stocks. Haha. I will just use my belt.
3803 2018-03-01 03:37:48 What is the deal with these oil stocks man!?  Where is the bounce to?
3804 2018-03-01 03:36:44 Exchanges tricked a lot of people into thinking crypto works like stocks.
3805 2018-03-01 03:36:32 Like I mentioned earlier today:  A month ago, he would've asked whether he had any investments in "bump stocks" if someone had used the term.  Now he's the authority on weapons...what a joke!
3806 2018-03-01 03:36:16 Bump stocks are just plain gay. Seriously gay. They shouldn’t have to be illegal because any self respecting firearms owner should say “these are gay” and skip it. And by gay I mean stupid. No offense to any gay people.
3807 2018-03-01 03:35:10 As of 11:30 a.m., PSEi 8.440.58 down 34.71 points or 0.41 percent. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
3808 2018-03-01 03:35:07 Especially on the prison end, run by for-profit corporations now, often with kickbacks going to judges....or at the very least, judges own stocks in the corps. Like Sessions does.
3809 2018-03-01 03:34:59 Dick's Sporting Goods stores will stop selling assault rifles, large capacity magazines, & bump stocks. Wal-Mart will raise the age to buy firearms and ammunition to 21. That's good leadership from business community in response to terrible shooting at the Parkland, Fla. school.
3810 2018-03-01 03:34:09 well done to 'Money Making' Mitch McCarron and 'Diversified portfolio of stocks, property and bonds, that yield an above-trend value and dividend' Cam Gliddon.
3811 2018-03-01 03:33:37 In gas stocks any thing in particular ?
3812 2018-03-01 03:33:22 Those people are not consultants! They trade managers like they used to trade stocks. They are interested in Ka-ching
3813 2018-03-01 03:33:16 Not worried at all. Leveraging both sides to come up with reasonable tightening of background searches, banning bump stocks and removing weapons from mentally unstable individuals pending adjudication. Only Trump can do it.
3814 2018-03-01 03:33:11 Biggest retard on Twitter, sell all your stocks, sell your car, take out a second mortgage on the house, sell everything and buy $SX and $GRAT, biggest hypocrite ever
3815 2018-03-01 03:32:24 Face it there is the rule of nothing in this country. Same way Rome went down. Judges making policy. Governors and Mayors giving foreign nationals the right to vote. Stocks markets juiced by computers. Innumerable trillions in debt. Rome is on Fire  and we are burning.
3816 2018-03-01 03:32:21 @realDonaldTrump If you want to get rid of bump stocks by EO, fine.  Obama would be proud.  If you're in an EO mood, dump DACA. It's not law and it's not legal. Judges have no right to dictate policy.  Why do you let them get away with it?
3817 2018-03-01 03:32:17 Hes banning bump stocks for one. Something Obama wouldn’t and didn’t do
3818 2018-03-01 03:31:34 Yes, the ATF has stated more than once that current law doesn't ban bump stocks, so an Executive Order wouldn't hold up. Congress needs to ban them or at least restrict them. Agree about govt oversteps, remember when people hated governance by Exec Order?
3819 2018-03-01 03:31:23 I bought stocks on weed ima be rich
3820 2018-03-01 03:31:20 Never understood bump stocks, I've grown up at shooting ranges and most experienced people know how to position a rifle on your shoulder so the kick from your rifle will bounce forward into your finger causing the same "bump" effect
3821 2018-03-01 03:31:09 @SpeakerRyan  Enough.Get cohorts out of NRA back pocket.Time for no: assault rifles, bump stocks. Need: 21 age min, more thorough background checks. This has NOTHING to do with 2nd Amendment.
3822 2018-03-01 03:30:22 Today is a proud day!  Thanks @Walmart for putting age limits on sales of guns and @DICKS for ending your sales of assault rifles!  @realDonaldTrump.. PLEASE stick to your word regarding banning bump stocks and enforcing background checks! #TakeAction
3823 2018-03-01 03:30:16 Like in stocks, there is alot of factors that determine economic growth.

3825 2018-03-01 03:30:00 I’m glad you have that level of reason re: bump stocks. Honestly. And HAVE you seen the results from Australia’s response to their mass shooting? None since. Protect kids, or your insecurities. I’ll take kids.
3826 2018-03-01 03:29:49 I’ll believe Trump wants to ban bump stocks when he actually uses his influence to get the GOP Congress to pass legislation banning them. The ATF has already said that it is beyond their authority and it would take Congressional action to make it happen.
3827 2018-03-01 03:29:44 @seanhannity for the record, do you agree with Trump's proposed ban on bump stocks? Do you think someone must be 21 to buy an AR15? I'm asking respectfully as a conservative and #2A supporter. Thank you :)
3828 2018-03-01 03:29:22 He hasn't. Media is pushing this. Trump has only stated he would bann bump stocks which he should. That's not taking away 2nd Amendment.
3829 2018-03-01 03:29:14 Instead of relying on you to do anything just ban assault weapons, bump stocks, bury the thought of silencers. Start now, cross your fingers and pray it's not to late to stop the next time.
3830 2018-03-01 03:29:11 @donlemon  Executive orders can be reversed with a pen. Congress must act on bump stocks.
3831 2018-03-01 03:28:52 He means he did them all. Literal all the drugs. They ran out. Stocks are gone and shelves are empty.
3832 2018-03-01 03:28:26 Since #Fed chair Jerome #Powell testified to Congress on Tues, the Dow is down almost 700 points. What will his testimony tomorrow (Thurs.) bring? Markets also have to digest the resignation of #HopeHicks. Your thoughts?

3833 2018-03-01 03:28:22 There are loopholes, too many to address in a tweet, it's not cracks. The system is broken.  Your own arguments even point this out.  Yet you suggest it's a problem of enforcing existing laws?  No background checks, no waiting period, gun show loophole, bump stocks?
3834 2018-03-01 03:28:18 @JeffFlake Enough.Get cohorts out of NRA back pocket.Time for no: assault rifles, bump stocks, 21 age min, more thorough background checks. This has NOTHING to do with 2nd Amendment.
3835 2018-03-01 03:28:04 Another reality TV production like the DACA show you did earlier?  I will believe your sincerity if I see you sign a bill banning the sale a assault rifles, bumb stocks and raising age to buy any firearm or ammo to 21. Otherwise, just another waste of time for everyone
3836 2018-03-01 03:27:58 What on earth is going on? Think it is bottoming soon? I’m getting hammered plus other oil stocks ouch
3837 2018-03-01 03:27:52 STOCKS TO WATCH Auto companies will report February sales numbers.
3838 2018-03-01 03:27:44 How about you ban assault weapons and bump stocks. I watched you on TV today and, as an Iowan, was deeply saddened by your comments.
3839 2018-03-01 03:27:02 Nice to be home this evening working on my stocks. It's a great feeling to see things start to come together.  

 I hope to run into some of you this weekend. I am looking forward to the days off.
3840 2018-03-01 03:26:48 Also trailer tire,liquid cheese and polyester stocks are really going to take a kick in the ass
3841 2018-03-01 03:26:07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. You made a campaign promise to protect our rights. BUMP STOCKS were not used in Florida or Law Vegas.  Raising the age would have not stopped the Florida or Law Vegas.  Florida shooter has access to other weapons in his home.

3844 2018-03-01 03:24:12 Bump stocks should be in a bill because exec orders can be repealed
3845 2018-03-01 03:23:13 Hey Feinstein, where have you been ? The President said they would ban bump stocks.
3846 2018-03-01 03:23:11 Trump's reelection campaign used a photo of one of the survivors from the school shooting in an email soliciting campaign donations."Trump is taking steps toward banning gun bump stocks and strengthening background checks for gun purchasers," the email reads
3847 2018-03-01 03:21:47 Nganong wa man moy stocks sa moby oyyyy 
3848 2018-03-01 03:21:21 @JustinMarshallM - everything i read is uber bearish on oil stocks right now. Scaring me a little.
3849 2018-03-01 03:21:11 This statement... SMH... There is no need to fire faster... Unless of course, you are trying to take out  "several" moving objects.
Bump Stocks are NOT needed in households or in America.
3850 2018-03-01 03:20:04 Just saying. If Obama tried to ban bump stocks via exec order nd not Congress, and said take the guns first, worry about due process later, you’d be pissed. Rightfully so.
3851 2018-03-01 03:19:56 Trump said take guns 1st, due process 2nd. Bump stocks are gone.
3852 2018-03-01 03:19:35 @Emma4Change @al3xw1nd @maddow @JoyAnnReid @AriMelber @chrislhayes @Lawrence Trying to get educators across the country whose retirement funs are managed by @TIAA to ask them to divest gun stocks. You have more followers. Retweet?
3853 2018-03-01 03:19:26 Since bump stocks aren't regulated by the federal government or the ATF Trump's on pretty shaky legal ground trying to ban them. Like trying to ban a flashlight attachment.
3854 2018-03-01 03:19:26 I mean the term "assault rifle" is extremely broad, if you're asking if bump stocks should be handled the way we handle full-auto guns then yes
3855 2018-03-01 03:18:37 Day 2 is just about over. Massive headache, really tired. I had to get some kind of protein so i had 2 stocks of celery with peanut butter on them... @JoetheJuicer damn you made it look easy... but i did come up with a good juice recipe involving dragon fruit today
3856 2018-03-01 03:18:01 @SheriffClarke wrong.bump stocks turn them automatic.
3857 2018-03-01 03:17:59 Probably not. But it's a first step towards common sense gun laws  such as no guns for folks with mental illness, restraining orders, no-fly list, etc. and no assault rifles or bump stocks, background checks with waiting periods.
I'm a gun owner and can support those laws.
3858 2018-03-01 03:17:24 Stocks...
3859 2018-03-01 03:17:01 if stocks are going down then you know what will happen next
3860 2018-03-01 03:16:06 Bump stocks are bot even close to machine guns and nobody cares if they get banned.  This is democrats you start with AR's then everything else.  It would just be nice if democrats had the littlest knowledge about guns or society for that matter.  You guys created these sickos.

3866 2018-03-01 03:12:55 Trump loses Hope, but can we put Faith and Love into his musings to ban bump stocks, and raise the gun purchase age to 21? One day, one tweet at a time. #WhiteLies
3867 2018-03-01 03:12:42 the right to bear arms is true.....but congress can still regulate what arms it is....banning semis....bump stocks...assault guns..doesnt hurt that ammendment that you can still own a gun.....now its just if congress can get some balls and stand up to the " PRO CONTRIBUTING NRA "
3868 2018-03-01 03:12:25 Feb will probably be the worst month for stocks in two years, you can't loot the government and add trillions to the deficit without worry.
3869 2018-03-01 03:12:25 Let’s just getting something done that moves this forward. Talking too long and time is of the essence. I think banning the bump stocks, raising the minimum age and fixing the background checks is a good start. Let’s get that passed and then work on banning.
3870 2018-03-01 03:12:17 @TDAmeritrade I'm new from Scottrade. Why isn't there a total column under my stocks daily $ +/- to give me a daily total of gains and losses for all my positions?
3871 2018-03-01 03:11:56 If wall Mart and Dicks really want to make a difference, they should stop doing business with the manufacturers of Assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines for sales to the public
3872 2018-03-01 03:11:32 Bump stocks ARE automatic weapons and should be classified as such. And you can obtain a license for automatic weapons if you desire one
3873 2018-03-01 03:10:53 bump stocks = gimmicks just like trigger systems to manipulate rate of fire both are a waste of money and ammo beyond the short lived “wow” factor
3874 2018-03-01 03:10:52 I know what you mean, some of the indicators I use only works for some particular stocks, others not so much. Could be algos making it happen
3875 2018-03-01 03:10:49 How many of you buying extra bump stocks to sell them on the black market after they get outlawed? You know it’s happening #GunControl

Texas extremist groups don't back you and you don't position well with rational Republicans.
You have to take a stand against assault weapons and bump stocks, set up universal databases including domestic violence issues, and close loopholes.
3883 2018-03-01 03:07:25 Thank you very much sir. Requested if you can guide us for 4 to 5 secular growth stocks for next 10 years
3884 2018-03-01 03:07:15 what????? BAN assault weapons/weapons of war. BAN high capacity magazines. BAN bump stocks
3885 2018-03-01 03:06:47 GOP legislators block gun control reform in NY - including ban on bump stocks -in State Senate.

Only reason the GOP has control of NYS Senate - Independent Democratic Conference. They are reason why this is even a thing.
3886 2018-03-01 03:06:46 Capitalism requires capital. And lets face it. Many of these tokens are better used as stocks or equities. Just gotta update the laws
3887 2018-03-01 03:06:43 The only way???? Another bill wouldn’t ban them? A bill fixing NICS, allowing ccw reciprocity, and banning bump stocks wouldn’t work?
3888 2018-03-01 03:06:34 Jim Cramer pumps bank stocks right before they collapse.

3894 2018-03-01 03:04:17 BuuUUUuuuuummp the bump stocks, I say
3895 2018-03-01 03:04:05 In the last like 72 hours I've signed 2 new artists to Flunked, interviewed by a blog, booked on another festival, mastered a track, made money flipping stocks, been taking care of my son plus the 30 something hours at work 

Productive week and it's half way over
3896 2018-03-01 03:03:46 Lol nah she stocks up on stuff
3897 2018-03-01 03:03:45 Barbra Streisand is a moron.  After decades of gun violence, she blames the current President?  HE is the one asking the NRA to tighten up the laws.  HE is the one trying to ban bump stocks.  #HollywoodHypocrites #Dems are Clueless!
3898 2018-03-01 03:03:33 Many good stocks at PE>25, so are these expensive??. I think these have been able to grow at those levels and hence command greater valuations.
3899 2018-03-01 03:03:17 People want immediate action- Or did I miss the memo? Bump stocks makes sense. Due process? Laughable. Do you know how LONG it takes for due process of anything? If someone speaks suicidal, they take away weapons & rope. No mental tests (process) necessary. Same applies here
3900 2018-03-01 03:03:14 hala may buying power pa ko sa stocks huhu daddy nakalimutan mo na naman HAHAHAHAHA pano yung for February ko 
3901 2018-03-01 03:03:14 Sometimes watching Trump govern was like watching a comedy. 
#Parkland shooting aftermath: Trump's proposal to arm teachers will likely turn future shooting into shootout. Trump's bum stocks ban won't work due to new 3D printing technology.
3902 2018-03-01 03:03:14 Yea Tom, let “Us” leave “Them” to their madness and we’ll go buy stocks while the price is down
3903 2018-03-01 03:02:53 Yeah he's doing a terrible job...

Tax cuts. Jobs. Killing ISIS. Stocks. Consumer confidence. Companies investing in America. 

Horrible!!!!

3904 2018-03-01 03:02:15 After hours stocks made up everything they lost and then some 
3905 2018-03-01 03:01:58 Trump is just going to write off bump stocks 
3906 2018-03-01 03:01:41 Yes, the Cons "balanced" a budget - by selling our GM stocks at a loss and closing Veteran services centres.
3907 2018-03-01 03:01:22 Actually automatic rifles are not banned, but they are heavily restricted. As I already explained, increased rate of fire for a semi can be accomplished manually, so banning bump stocks do nothing.  No bump stocks were used for any of the shootings you listed expect for Vegas.

Also, RE: Bump stocks; wait until folks hear about 3D printers.

3912 2018-03-01 02:59:50 Today it is often used by investors to explain a less-than-ideal portfolio allocation, usually to stocks, since other asset classes offer even worse returns #TINAFactor
3913 2018-03-01 02:59:37 Today karti Chidambaram arrested by cbi 
I don't know if he is guilty or not but there are numerous looters in our society yet living a lavish life especially from the corporate world 
All retail investors must unite against them by rejecting there stocks
3914 2018-03-01 02:59:36 Actually I don’t think that is true. In retirement it is my experience that 80% of your portfolio should drive 90% of your returns. This ratio might / would be lower at an earlier age but never 20/80. Only caveat would be explosive growth stocks but these are not predictable.
3915 2018-03-01 02:59:18 Lololololol Trump will raise the age and ban bump stocks but the AR isn't going anywhere
3916 2018-03-01 02:59:00 True but sometimes I just want to play different stocks with different characters and play different modes
3917 2018-03-01 02:58:49 Is that old bat even aware that you could still get all those firearms during the assault weapons ban? Just couldn't have deadly bayonet lugs, adjustable stocks and a few other features?
3918 2018-03-01 02:58:46 Not the point. You want to ban bump stocks, then Congress needs to pass a law. The President has no authority to be banning thing by order.
3919 2018-03-01 02:58:29 Walmart always required background checks, way beyond the law. Also, they don't sell AR-15s or similar. They've never sold bump stocks, large capacity ammo or any similar accessories. They only sell hand guns in Alaska.

3923 2018-03-01 02:57:49 Giving up bump stocks is a no brainer . 1 ok- ed by Hussein 2 waste of ammo . 3 nobody is taking anything I own .
3924 2018-03-01 02:57:11 That’s why the most permanent solutions would be the ones that are the least infringing on gun owners, such as banning bump stocks and closing every background-check loophole. There aren’t many, but there shouldn’t be any.
3925 2018-03-01 02:57:08 Today we add $LOW to the many stocks that recently experienced unusual call activity - which turned out to be non predictive of further stock strength.  Other recent false tells included $WMT, $DIS, $VRX.  All these stocks have collapsed within one week of unusual call activity.
3926 2018-03-01 02:57:05 True! Hahaha pero kebs uiii hahaha! Ta ase yo kaba myo chocolate stocks aki lol
3927 2018-03-01 02:56:33 103 now. 1.6% dividend. Semi annual dividend. 2k to them or 2k to pg or o. 32 bucks a year in dividends vs like 70 with pg and 130 with o...

Ive kicked myself though for not buying stocks based on dividend.
3928 2018-03-01 02:56:15 As a law abiding citizen who hunts and goes to the shooting range often, I'm not opposed to banning bump stocks, having stricter background checks or raising the age to purchase rifles. I'm also in favor of concealed carry permits. #SignMeUp

3932 2018-03-01 02:55:28 I'll give it to Trump, he is trying to restrict a lot of your gun rights including bump stocks. And he said take away the guns first and deal with due process later in reference to at risk people. Let's just hope he doesn't flop on this. Positive steps in the right direction
3933 2018-03-01 02:55:06 Why does anyone need bump stocks?
3934 2018-03-01 02:54:55 Actually automatic rifles are already banned but bump stocks turn semi auto rifles essentially into auto rifles. They were used in columbine, sandy hook, Las Vegas, Orlando and parkland. We need to ban bump stocks.
3935 2018-03-01 02:54:51 THOUGHT OF THE DAY

Like any skill, investing must be LEARNED before it can be successfully applied. Making money in the past few years in stocks has been "easy" only if you "believe" that making money in the markets is easy.

3937 2018-03-01 02:54:31 Depends on how long you plan to hold a stock and only you can decide what your entry price is as well as your exit. Not all stocks run in tandem.
3938 2018-03-01 02:54:10 After Sandy Hook, bump stocks were never mentioned. Not 2 us! Why?@GOP used everything but the kitchen sink 2 stop any gun reform from passing,& succeeded. I hope @DNC is ready 2 fight much harder 2day than they did then. I felt @DNC didn't fight hard enough & was disappointed!
3939 2018-03-01 02:54:06 India is heading for a political disaster unless a unexpected event takes place.
So folks be watchful of stocks portfolios.
3940 2018-03-01 02:53:56 Listen real good Mr. @Ron_Shanks21  NOBODY is trying to TAKE your guns.  What the MAJORITY of this country is demanding is "stricter" gun laws and making bump stocks and "assault" style guns illegal.
We're tired of innocent kids or anyone else being killed....you should be to.
3941 2018-03-01 02:53:53 Good start ! Please just stop selling AR Rifles and Bum Stocks

3945 2018-03-01 02:53:15 When any of them apologise, it's always as a last resort or to distance themselves, kinda like what happened with Hannity an Carlson when they found out the Haab guy confessed.
 I also thought bump stocks were definitely being banned by Trump, as well as other controls?
3946 2018-03-01 02:51:56 Missing the floor, stocks and my crew...
3947 2018-03-01 02:51:49 Its not about bump stocks. It is the process.

You want to ban bump stocks, then Congress should pass a law!

3958 2018-03-01 02:49:49 Good luck getting re-elected if you stand with that nonsense about taking guns before allowing for due process. That's Communism. Guns had NOTHING to do with the Parkland shooting, nor did bump stocks. It had everything to do with YOUR FBI failures and local police incompetence.
3959 2018-03-01 02:49:23 @DLoesch Do you really think banning bump stocks will stop school shootings.I cant remember when or if ever one was used in a school shooting.I only remember A sick old man using one in Vegas that shouldnt of even had a gun.

3964 2018-03-01 02:48:24 Bump stocks are not a gun.  They are an accessory to a gun.  There is nothing that says anything about accessories.
3965 2018-03-01 02:47:45 I’ve been in similar circumstances. It’s just frustrating when the appreciation and regard for the craft isn’t there.

Might I also mention that you do awesome work, by the way.
3966 2018-03-01 02:47:37 I do not care about the age going up or bump stocks, but regarding background checks, not sure how they plan on making that stricter if FBI and local law enforcement do not do their jobs!! That was paramount in the last case.
3967 2018-03-01 02:46:34 Yeah, just did a 2 week analysis of stocks, bonds and commodities. Im looking at monster GFC within 2 years.
3968 2018-03-01 02:46:28 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U.

3969 2018-03-01 02:46:17 I don’t see how bump stocks are a right?

3973 2018-03-01 02:45:53 Firstly, let's clarify This by making sure that I speak clearly. I'd like to see "sensible gun reform". All gun purchases by age 21. Background check to include a mental health status exam. 28 day waiting period to conclude the background check. No bump stocks or any other

3987 2018-03-01 02:41:53 I think some form of comprehensive license system might help, but people are afraid of anything resembling a gun registry. Banning things like bump stocks & high-cap magazines should also be common sense but apparently aren't. Even universal background checks are opposed by some.
3988 2018-03-01 02:41:49 No there are plenty of things we can tighten up on checks, bump stocks and age that won't hurt anyone. 18y/o not as ready as old days.

3991 2018-03-01 02:41:18 NO AR-15 at all!! NO BUMP STOCKS at all!! STRONG BACKGROUND CHECKS and long waiting period!!   Limit gun sales!!  ENOUGH is ENOUGH way back before Sandy Hook!!  Will not vote for anyone taking money from NRA!!

3994 2018-03-01 02:40:25 Banning bump stocks by executive order.

Take the guns first, due process later.

Trump finally starts speaking like a dictator, and Democrats love it!

3996 2018-03-01 02:40:14 Certainly. Gun manufacturers want legislation to hit the floor. Causes surges in buying. Stocks be damned they are about futures. Orders are the name of the game.
3997 2018-03-01 02:40:13 It’s odd to have a masters degree music school trained guitar teacher who also trades stocks. I feel torn every time he comes to the house. Do I spend my time discussing macro conditions or the fact I can’t control my pinky properly?

4001 2018-03-01 02:39:29 Fast yes, accurrate, not really. Recoil moves the sight, which increases spray. Squeezing off a round, re-centering and squeezing off another round is far deadlier due to increased accuracy. Like clip sizes, banning bump stocks is pointless.
4002 2018-03-01 02:38:59 You forgot; there will soon be a load of unemployed bump stocks that could fill the position. 
4003 2018-03-01 02:38:18 that's nice, but are they selling military assault weapons, bump stocks, ammunition to over 21ers? A good portion of mass shooters were over 21. #AssaultWeaponsBan

DT’s so ineffective, I can’t imagine him actually getting anything substantive passed.

4009 2018-03-01 02:36:56 Feeling rather betrayed by @potus, @FBI, and @browardsheriff. Two of them failed, so that the other has to act.  But, over reacting is not the answer. Take bump stocks, not the AR. Let young families hunt and defend their homes.
4010 2018-03-01 02:36:28 You believe this? Hard for me to believe. A lot of stocks are down and coming back after the recent drop

4013 2018-03-01 02:35:51 Restrict AR ammo to 1500 FPS and energy is reduced by 78%, bump stocks stop working and yet you can still use the rifle at the range. Effectively neutering all AR's.
4014 2018-03-01 02:35:36 High bond yields abroad and high P/E multiple of Indian stocks  along with a cocktail of Pnb scam is the reason that FIIs are taking a break from Indian stocks.

4019 2018-03-01 02:33:58 NIGGAS BE ACTING LIKE THEY TOO COOL TO INVEST IN STOCKS.
4020 2018-03-01 02:33:28 how do you come up with your list of stocks to trade each day? Always such a wide variety of names
4021 2018-03-01 02:33:14 Watch their stocks.
4022 2018-03-01 02:32:50 Dudley also said that 10%selloff in stocks has no economic implications. 
Dudley, the biggest dove in Fed history, always pushed more intervention all indicates Powell Fed has different view of stocks. Mester said selloff & volatility jump will not damage economy overall progress
4023 2018-03-01 02:32:45 So ban bump stocks and there's a big difference again. Ya know that in a gun free zone -schools- someone with an old 6 shot revolver could kill 10-20 people just because it's like shooting ducks in a barrel there. Who would stop the shooter?
4024 2018-03-01 02:32:34 Sold all 5 of my mutual funds that had gun stocks in them. I didn't even know those stocks were in my mutual funds until I asked my financial adviser. And I wasn't happy when I realized they were
4025 2018-03-01 02:32:32 You're right, it's not being proposed. Ineffective measures are. Example, trumpkins said he's going to ban bump stocks. All that does is reduce bullet spray making the weapon in question more accurate.
4026 2018-03-01 02:32:06 I still reckon the Stocks are a good option..  somewhere we can throw cabbages at her
4027 2018-03-01 02:31:42 as a DCP we are finding it hard to liquidate our remaining stocks.
4028 2018-03-01 02:31:29 Kay kadumdum ko ga duwa2 mi sa stocks para sa among FinMan408 hahaha

I tried to love it but I can't. Charot hahaha
4029 2018-03-01 02:31:02 Especially when I stood in the rain to take the pictures so editing took even longer
4030 2018-03-01 02:30:26 Fact that one might, as part of an index, own stocks in an additional 499 companies, doesn't change the fact that one is—in fact—an owner of a gun company. Ideology immaterial. Surely many gun manufacturers themselves aren't ideological either—they're just doing it to make money!
4031 2018-03-01 02:30:22 time to read up on stocks
4032 2018-03-01 02:29:42 So banning bump stocks and making sure every gun sale has a background check will infringe the rights of law abiding citizens?

NRA lie to you about what gun control lobby even wants.
4033 2018-03-01 02:29:34 That’s bullish for stocks there cheap buy buy
4034 2018-03-01 02:29:19 Trump is advocating all of the things the right accused Obama of. He’s proposed upping age of ownership, banning bump stocks, and now total confiscation. Lmao I can’t wait to see how the right wraps their minds around this.

4037 2018-03-01 02:28:01 I received one of those, MA outlawed bump stocks, they must be unaware of “Ex Post Facto”.
4038 2018-03-01 02:26:52 preferred stocks let you receive monthly dividends
4039 2018-03-01 02:26:39 I bought mro, Apc, kmi this am. Wish I waited. All of oil stocks are on the bottom of support if it breaks is what I’m worried about
4040 2018-03-01 02:26:33 Hillary and Soros probably bought stock and gave them a big bonus payment upfront or traded some stocks. Libs don't do nothing for free.
4041 2018-03-01 02:26:26 NO IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY. WEREN'T YOU AT THE MEETING TODAY? I SAW YOU THERE SO MAYBE YOU ARE JUST TOO OLD TO HEAR OR READ SO I'LL TYPE IN CAPS. TRUMP IS SIGNING EXEC ORDER TO BAN OF BUMP STOCKS. SO DON'T BOW, THANK POTUS AND GIVE CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE!!!
4042 2018-03-01 02:26:20 CLSA Initiates report with a BUY Rating on Dalmia Bharat : High risk-reward among front-line cement stocks. Target Price of Rs 3500
Says In just over a decade, Dalmia has transformed itself from a marginal to a top fiveplayer in India through organic , inorganic routes.
4043 2018-03-01 02:25:45 Good luck with that one John.
Suggest you have a late breakfast and reflect on something. 
It beats a wasted journey any day 
Best check your wine cellar and beer stocks instead.
4044 2018-03-01 02:25:34 Trump is banning bump stocks raising the age limit for purchasing guns and talking about confiscating guns from mentaly ill individuals this is by far more then any Democrat could have dreamed of doing why do you still hate him?
4045 2018-03-01 02:23:57 LOL people are so dumb. Not only will it never pass its way too early to sell stocks. Not while people are stocking up.
4046 2018-03-01 02:23:52 BKLLF spiiked almost 300% after Hrs today
4047 2018-03-01 02:23:43 Banning bump stocks is gobbeldy goop for confiscation! Don't fall for it people. Gun Violence is a politically made up term. Just call it what it is, VIOLENT CRIME.
4048 2018-03-01 02:23:43 I'm curious why you guys are so stressed? My taxes have been cut, my 401K is up 30%, my stocks are soaring, I got a pay raise thanks to tax cuts. ISIS lost 99% territory since Trump has taken office. His immigration plan for DACA is great-1.8M dreamers and he is running in 2020!
4049 2018-03-01 02:23:40 Dudley said 10% correction was small potatoes. Powell made 0 mention of stocks in swearing in ceremony, no mention of markets. It was rate “normalization, balance sheet shrinkage, regulation of largest banks institutions. Important responsibilities for stability financial system”
4050 2018-03-01 02:23:37 Hot Take: Invest in Chocolate and Flower stocks will you can, because their sales are going to skyrocket once women discover we have no good comeback for "Jack would do it for Rebecca" on This Is Us
4051 2018-03-01 02:22:48 Might fuck around and throw my stocks back on and smoke them out 
4052 2018-03-01 02:22:44 Wall Street was not friendly today! #Stocks #StockMarket #WallStreet #CBIS #MJNA #GOHE #BMXI
4053 2018-03-01 02:22:25 I’m guessing you are a Republican @timsayswords .So let me ask you a few quick questions. How do you feel about AR-15’s? Bump Stocks? Stronger Background checks? An assault rifle ban? Raising the age to 21? I’m guessing you are for them since all these children are being murdered
4054 2018-03-01 02:21:56 I miss eating chocolate bars with that foil similar to the ammo stocks. #friendlyfire
4055 2018-03-01 02:21:26 Do they sell assault rifles? Or bump stocks?
4056 2018-03-01 02:20:42 Talk to Obama. NRA wanted bump stocks outlawed back in 2012. Obama Admin blocked it.
4057 2018-03-01 02:20:31 Semi-auto is full-auto with an additional limiter, the minor difference in behavior (and abusing the tolerances of that limiter) is why bump-firing/bump-stocks even exist or do anything at all in the first place. So yes, I consider then functional identical at their core. :)
4058 2018-03-01 02:20:24 Oh Yeah!! They are Freaking the heck out!  We are supposed to have forgotten about this shooting by now - I think they are done for.  They are very unpopular. The companies jumping ship are getting new sales and their stocks are going up!
4059 2018-03-01 02:20:23 Due to impending political instability, I recommend you consider selling any stocks you presently hold. Not a panic exit. Rather, note the highest price reached over the past month. Exit the trade via Limit Order. Set the limit to a few ticks below the highest recent price.
4060 2018-03-01 02:20:04 Global Cues: European Stocks Close Lower On Fed Chairman's Comments
4061 2018-03-01 02:18:32 Who crafted the bump stock law which says you can buy and own bump stocks you just can not use it? That's kinda stupid?
4062 2018-03-01 02:17:31 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your carpal tunnel syndrome
4063 2018-03-01 02:17:19 @realDonaldTrump @GOP   NOW  ABOUT BANNING “BUMP” STOCKS?  FLORIDA PARKLAND SHOOTER DID NOT EVEN USE THIS “LEGAL” DEVICE!!  JUST PLAIN OLE “ASSULT “ RIFLE!!

4066 2018-03-01 02:16:14 Not at all. Bump stocks did not cause Vegas. I am fine with getting rid of them but that mass killing would have happened without them. I will reserve my finger pointing for another issue.
4067 2018-03-01 02:14:59 im talking about pipeline stocks not frackers
4068 2018-03-01 02:13:34 It’s like getting rid of bump stocks. Doesn’t change a thing but the left still feel like they won.
4069 2018-03-01 02:13:16 @upstox hi.. just moved from @zerodhaonline to you cuz of my office restrictions on zerodha.. im missing daily variation of stocks amd net P&L in holdings page.. also theres no options to know % movmnt of a share on charts page which zerodha does wndrfully.. plz do sth abt it..
4070 2018-03-01 02:12:52 I feel good knowing that if there's an emergency, my stocks can be my safety net.
4071 2018-03-01 02:12:44 We’ll see. $30 million tells me that he’s just talking shit to please people, but he won’t act. Said he’s going to ban bump stocks, but that’s just a small part of the problem.
4072 2018-03-01 02:12:34 Yes bump stocks make aiming almost impossible but the LV shooter was shooting at a huge crowd from an elevated position so I believe it helped him kill more in his specific instance. He didn’t need to aim he just needed rapid fire which the bump stock provided.
4073 2018-03-01 02:11:37 That’s always the worst. People don’t realize how long photo editing can potentially take.
4074 2018-03-01 02:10:39 Yeah Trump is gonna have a hard time if he goes further than bump stocks and raising the age limit. If hes talking about gun violence restraining order GVRO it might be good if written correctly.
4075 2018-03-01 02:10:36 Bump stocks allow you to fire more rapidly without pulling the trigger
4076 2018-03-01 02:10:25 I’m willing to give them banned bump stocks if they give me banned 3rd trimester abortions. Suppose there’s any takers?
4077 2018-03-01 02:09:24 Any breakout on intraday on such charts would increase the probability of finding such stocks, also everything is limited to 0.25 margin stocks so they are just handful

4081 2018-03-01 02:07:27 Yhea both Obama & Holder were together on Certifying Bump Stocks & sending weapons to Mexico. Great partnership.
4082 2018-03-01 02:06:44 Profits will decline next, it's  a good time to put your stocks in their competitors.
4083 2018-03-01 02:06:19 So some school districts are banning backpacks but lawmakers can’t ban things like bump stocks? I guess the right to bear backpacks wasn’t taken into consideration when the Constitution was written.
4084 2018-03-01 02:05:30 If atna was into stocks back in the day 

"ENRON"
4085 2018-03-01 02:05:30 As of 10:00 a.m., PSEi 8,449.94 down 25.35 points or 0.30 percent. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
4086 2018-03-01 02:04:59 And bump stocks don’t make a rife  into a machine gun! Uneducated ppl shouldn’t spread untruths!
4087 2018-03-01 02:04:54 "We're not ditching any Constitutional protections" said @SenSasse Where does the Constitution set an age for purchasing weapons or mandate bump stocks and assault rifles cannot be outlawed? When the 2nd amendment was ratified most rifles could fire just 3 rounds/min. #NRAButtboy
4088 2018-03-01 02:03:56 He's not diving on 2nd Amendment. Raising the age to 21 and outlawing bump stocks good for country. Concealed carry should be separate bill.
4089 2018-03-01 02:03:34 Praise the Lord And I thought snake handlers were bad! Are they baptized in bullets or bump stocks
4090 2018-03-01 02:02:35 It is true that the far left would love to ban private ownership of all guns.  But banning semi auto weapons and bump stocks doesn't necessarily begin a slippery slope.
4091 2018-03-01 02:02:07 Finally out .357 will head back in but with less risk had 22k shares
4092 2018-03-01 02:02:05 @sarahchad_ Ask your teachers if @TIAA is where their retirement funds are invested. If yes, urge them to ask @TIAA to divest all gun maker stocks.
4093 2018-03-01 02:02:05 日本株はもう上昇しない、将来期待で長期保有する理由はない。となると、保有することのリスクが意識されるので売られやすくなる。前からそんなふうに見ているが、このかんその気持ちが強くなった。Can't find any reason why JP stocks will go up further north. The bear market is drawing near.
4094 2018-03-01 02:00:44 Banning bump stocks is a token, do try to keep up, because you're right, it's a gizmo and a toy anyway.  Bump stocks mean nothing, and if people like you are fooled into believing banning them matters one wit, then you deserve the cheap high you'll receive from the news.
4095 2018-03-01 02:00:35 They will need to develop better wallets & security options. People already manage multiple currencies, stocks etc. I don’t think the token economy is going to go away just because it’s too hard for some people
4096 2018-03-01 02:00:27 2/ I firmly believe sane #GunControl can coexist w/the #2A. If states, ind schools & school districts opt for guns in their schools that is a *very* local school decision. However, comprehensive background checks (w/out loopholes), fixing NICS, banning bump-stocks-- (contd)
4097 2018-03-01 02:00:10 I agree Lynn President Trump has been great banning bump stocks as well with a stroke of the pen #MAGA2020
4098 2018-03-01 02:00:07 There is nothing reasonable about a ban on bump stocks, or raising the age to purchase a gun. Such proposals aim to infringe on rights. Infringing on rights is unreasonable #MolonLabe
4099 2018-03-01 01:59:03 Bump stocks also allow the rifle to slide back and forth which ruins accuracy. I know, liberals won't understand what that means.
4100 2018-03-01 01:58:36 NOT TRUE!! Bump stocks can be regulated out.  Assault weapons also known as Machine guns are already banned. The AR-15 is neither!!!
4101 2018-03-01 01:58:32 Josh maybe someone will listen when you ask, how was he able to naked short 32M shares from Merrill? I couldn't do it. Who at ML allowed him to do it? Why does the system allow FTDs/IOUs? Failure to settle in small cap OTC stocks can be the death of jobs and companies.
4102 2018-03-01 01:58:18 Firstly thanks for the civility. It’s different if a corp stocks a product, arbitrarily restricts by age not cause law requires, cause they feel like it & there’s a const. amendment saying you have a right to purchase that specially protected/regulated item. Provided u meet reqs.
4103 2018-03-01 01:58:01 The small gun reforms being discussed (background checks, banning bump stocks, etc.) would surely save lives but are not sufficient to stop mass shootings. If they pass then another shooting happens the NRA will forever use it as a talking point about why gun control doesn’t work
4104 2018-03-01 01:57:36 If Donald Trump wants to claim he would run into a school unarmed, to confront an active shooter, and in support of this statement he wants to ban bump stocks and change the age limit for purchasing weapons, I count one lie and two wins.  

Take the wins.
4105 2018-03-01 01:57:19 Buying Gun stocks again
4106 2018-03-01 01:57:02 The mental health system has been ravaged and underfunded since the 80s and including your proposed budget. We had fought for a ban on assault weapons,and the GOP let it expire. The NRA isn't with you on upping to 21, or bump stocks. I wish us all luck.
4107 2018-03-01 01:56:28 my son was just playing that game he came in 5th place  7yrs old kids these days 
4108 2018-03-01 01:56:01 About save all that money and do the right thing and ban assault weapons, close the private sale and gun show loopholes, don’t allow abusive or mentally ill to buy guns, ban gun stocks! Oh and did you see what a teacher did in Florida today with a gun?
4109 2018-03-01 01:55:56 March/April is historically the most bullish season for stocks and I expect this to also ring true for crypto assets. Don’t stress over this recent downtrend & consolidation period. Make no mistake there is a gigantic green storm brewin on the horizon.
4110 2018-03-01 01:55:35 no gun control. he already said he's going to ban bump stocks. my state just voted down banning bump stocks today.
4111 2018-03-01 01:55:13 My credit score went up 108 points last month my stocks went up a little bit too I’m investing in myself and I’m doing so so so so good thank God 
4112 2018-03-01 01:55:12 No one is taking guns from anyone, they want to increase the age to buy them and me, as a gun owner... All for it as well as banning bump stocks... No need for them
4113 2018-03-01 01:55:07 Yet bump stocks are legal. Strange. You’ve got all the answers. Tell me, what is it that bump stocks do?
4114 2018-03-01 01:54:48 For example NYSE is made of 2800 stocks, so if TICK is -1200, there are 1200 more stocks downticking than upticking. Which tells you there are 2000 stocks losing value and 800 gaining value.
4115 2018-03-01 01:54:25 TICK measures all stocks in the market that are upticking vs downticking at that moment in time and displays the result.
4116 2018-03-01 01:54:23 Who buying up that weed and spotify stocks?
4117 2018-03-01 01:53:26 Prima ils font la colle À cils Duo, en plus moins cher que chez Sephora/MAC  go faire des stocks
4118 2018-03-01 01:53:17 I totally agree with you Katie, but even though I am an #NRA member I do question the purpose of civilians having access to bump stocks. I’d like to find out more information on them.
4119 2018-03-01 01:52:17 Only ones ever affected are law abiding citizens.  Murder already illegal.  Wouldnt think a murderer will care about adding gun charges to run concurrent with murder?  Just sayn.  I will not give my guns up.... or bump stocks!  Again,just sayn!
4120 2018-03-01 01:51:54 Ban bump stocks and ban assault rifles that look like military weapons with high capacity magazines. Gullible kids, and some insecure adults, will go over the edge and use these guns to kill innocent kids. #StandWithTheStudents
4121 2018-03-01 01:50:47 I’m actually for the banning of bump stocks. I’m afraid it’s a slippery, slippery slope though.
4122 2018-03-01 01:50:25 I made a 92 stock drawing years ago along with a lot of other LU stocks, unfortunately the only place they still exist is on the hard drive from an old PC which I've never got round to retrieving the data from
4123 2018-03-01 01:50:17 Not sure...Should they behave like stocks or should they behave like bonds?
4124 2018-03-01 01:50:07 How about bump stocks and assault weapons? Are banning them part of your bill?
4125 2018-03-01 01:50:02 Don’t buy me a purse, buy me stocks
4126 2018-03-01 01:49:33 But really if a nigga can buy me a purse that much... invest in some stocks for me in my name
4127 2018-03-01 01:49:32 It’s no embrace! Banning bump stocks is the VERY LEAST he can do. He’s not out to save our kids! Shame on NYT!
4128 2018-03-01 01:49:31 The president is getting his pen all warmed up. First with the stocks, and from there it can be anything. Little history, AR15 was first developed in the late 50's and it's floor mat is most commonly used by civilian, military, and even commercial (private contracters).
4129 2018-03-01 01:48:36 Minecraft recorded   the AGGRESSION stocks !!
4130 2018-03-01 01:47:09 Hard to call the choice of a private company exercising it's right to change what it stocks unconstitutional but he's gonna TRY, dang it!
4131 2018-03-01 01:46:51 Bought back $MRC hoping I did the right thing . Lets go $MRC! #novice #stocks #stockmarketph #tradingneverstops #pse
4132 2018-03-01 01:46:00 It doesn't have to be negative growth.  Stocks are pricing in a very optimistic scenario.  The market doesn't  even price in a grey swan event!
4133 2018-03-01 01:45:33 Gun company stocks are tanking. Walmart knows it.
4134 2018-03-01 01:45:09 Chuckles, you don’t understand how stocks work. I will keep it simple. Company buys back stock, fewer stocks in open market, value of stocks go up, my stock or 401k goes up, company invests $ gains in new products, new products cause growth and..... repeat!!! Please shut UPChuck!
4135 2018-03-01 01:44:40 Honestly, I feel that banning Bump Stocks won't stop anything, however, I don't see the point in having them either. it's simply paying lip service to the left, a shiny red ball for them to chase.
4136 2018-03-01 01:43:51 Crumbs from the masters. Banning bump stocks won’t stop another massacre. What’s wrong with us that this is okay?
4137 2018-03-01 01:43:35 Walmart, 1/4 of way there. #DicksSportingGoods doing: (1) No sales for < 21. (2) No sales of Assault-style guns. (3) No sales of hi-capacity mags. (4) No sale of Bump Stocks.  Come on: #Walmart, #Cabellas, #BassProShops 95% of Americans do NOT want assault guns sold. #GunControl
4138 2018-03-01 01:43:06 I would think they would buy back their own stocks first so when they do invest more in their company and their profits go up then they can benefit from their stock values going up.
4139 2018-03-01 01:43:00 Machine guns have been banned for decades but a loophole in the law allows bump stocks. These dangerous devices allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at the rate of machine guns. Our bill is the ONLY way to ban them.
4140 2018-03-01 01:42:57 You @POTUS are being politically correct to ban bump stocks.
4141 2018-03-01 01:42:09 Really than why did you wait so long abt bump stocks. Vegas happened months ago. You could care less.
4142 2018-03-01 01:42:06 We dont care about bumper stocks. We care about our kids and the means to protect them. This prez or the next 100 will not take our rights.
4143 2018-03-01 01:41:44 Those Bump Stocks were made legal by Bill Clinton for what it is worth. Again it isn't the gun or the bump stock it is the sicko behind it
4144 2018-03-01 01:41:37 If I could stress one thing to clients it’s please please please DO NOT throw a terrible insta filter over an edit that I spent hours on AND tag me in the image that now looks nothing like my work!! That’s so rude
4145 2018-03-01 01:41:22 Bump stocks don't kill people. People do.
4146 2018-03-01 01:40:58 Hmmm, I may need to invest some stocks into this...
4147 2018-03-01 01:40:50 And he wants to get rid of bump stocks too!

4150 2018-03-01 01:39:59 I don't know but I do know that stocks for manufacturers went up within 24-48 hours after the Parkland shooting
4151 2018-03-01 01:39:23 When I disagree with him, I make it known. That being said, this is reminiscent of that on camera meeting he had with the Dems regarding immigration and the same thing happened there. I don't think he's serious about most of what he said today. Aside from bump stocks.
4152 2018-03-01 01:39:08 Im not off the Trump train and he has my vote, but if he pulls an EO on banning bump stocks, triggers etc... its over. He will lose his base. And we will lose our 2A.
4153 2018-03-01 01:39:00 Stocks: Volatile slip today. Intra-month short-term low due. At least intra-week low due. Intermediate trend likely up into May-Jul.
4154 2018-03-01 01:38:33 .@realDonaldTrump it appears as though you have pulled your head out of your ass as least for a while -do something presidential - get the background check passed / stop the sale of AR and AK guns in future  - those that have them keep them- elim bump stocks
4155 2018-03-01 01:38:30 $Fat $ime is going to turn and two of my biggest holdings . Great compaines with a massive future . Defenitly could of played both better. But I am here  for the long haul. Have other stocks to trade .
4156 2018-03-01 01:38:25 No ban on assault weapons. Still wants teachers to be a SWAT team and promised to get rid of bump stocks. Since we well know what Trumps promises are worth, looks like nothing will be done. Big surprise.
4157 2018-03-01 01:38:06 After recent shooting Democrats dropped all their cards on the floor for us all to see.  Their end game... In those cards are more than a gun and bump stocks, but the slippery slope to total confiscation starting with semi-autos which  like 90% of gun owners have.
4158 2018-03-01 01:38:05 Great point, Tony. Right now, I'm much more focused on Commodities over stocks or the e-Minis. Think it could be a very strong yr for most commodities, maybe best overall since 2012.
4159 2018-03-01 01:38:03 More sycophantic praise. Give it a rest. He is banning bump stocks by EO, instituting universal background checks (a REGISTRY to enforce), increasing buying age, & flat DISMISSING CCW reciprocity. Keep compromising away 2A #Trump. The guy is not a friend to the constitution or 2A
4160 2018-03-01 01:37:49 I’m all for it. Ban bumper stocks. Sell guns to 21+ and increase mental health background checks. Is it a 100% fix? Heck no. But it would help.
4161 2018-03-01 01:37:46 Dicks is doing the same thing. And not selling bump stocks and stuff
4162 2018-03-01 01:36:58 Ah, a purist.  Okay, a democratic republic. I don’t think anyone is talking whims here.  It’s interpreting the 2A and amending (or not) accordingly. Clearly, there are a few ways to interpret as, again, the FF weren’t talking about high capacity semi-autos with bump stocks.
4163 2018-03-01 01:36:43 my day on twitter:
spent the morning selling stocks and researching cock fighting and training, then i moved on to feathers used in fly fishing lures

i spent the afternoon LOL at stocks and the crumbling executive branch

it was a good day, learned a few things
4164 2018-03-01 01:36:38 Gerry brownlee should be put in stocks . And left there a while . It is tomatoe season .
4165 2018-03-01 01:36:12 You still got 3 stocks left !
4166 2018-03-01 01:35:57 Why all the talk about gun stocks ? As far as I know the Vegas shooter was the only time it's been used . I've never even heard of it before . I bet they have sold out by now just because of all the talk about banning them .
4167 2018-03-01 01:35:40 Brazilian Stocks  Sentiment from news is 0.1642
4168 2018-03-01 01:35:19 You're right.  Trump is trying to find a common ground with gun control by restricting bump stocks.

The left has moved on to total gun confiscation.
4169 2018-03-01 01:34:54 Remember to do your stocks for Selland 
4170 2018-03-01 01:34:37 Come on Laura, Congress will split on this and nothing will happen. Like always. POTUS isn't going to decree anything other than on bump stocks which are irrelevant.

4172 2018-03-01 01:32:55 I think you're over-reading into things. If you watch the intraday tick for tick action, you should be well aware of how main market weakness will at least pin/hold back even the strongest of stocks. The bigger picture is what matters, which is what I endeavour to focus on
4173 2018-03-01 01:31:36 I love and respect our soldiers, but I need a gun in case they start killing Americans on orders of a democrat. Pretty sure me and my buddies could take a platoon out with a few bump stocks.
4174 2018-03-01 01:31:34 THANK YOU-

DICKS' SPORTING GOODS 4 PUBLICALLY COMING OUT 2 SUPPORT;

1) BAN ON SALE OF ASSAULT RIFLES/HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES/BUMP-STOCKS

2) RAISE AGE 2 BUY ANY GUN TO 21

3) FULL BCKRND CHECKS 4 ALL GUN SALES

BUT WHY NOT START APPLYING THESE CHANGES IN YOUR OWN STORES TODAY?
4175 2018-03-01 01:30:53 Someone said similar during POTUS mtg today. If we raise the age, get rid of bump stocks, expand background checks, yada, yada, it will make everyone feel better. That’s now the panicle of policy? Does it make us feel better?
4176 2018-03-01 01:30:52 Haha! There is always another opportunity, with the exception of a few special moments/stocks (but they are very rare).
4177 2018-03-01 01:30:42 Yeah, get rid of bump stocks, but keep obama care?!
4178 2018-03-01 01:30:15 He said "the NRA controls too many politicians," he flat out rejected reciprocity, is banning bump stocks via EO, endorses universal background checks (a registry to enforce), and wants to raise the rifle buying age to 21. But he's not anti 2A. LOL. Defines sycophantic.
4179 2018-03-01 01:29:43 I'm just going to predict that the stocks of @DICKS will go down.   Just a hunch
4180 2018-03-01 01:29:24 Could we put bump stocks on these and use their gun barrels as their wine glasses?
4181 2018-03-01 01:29:12 Didn’t accuse them I said sick of people in general pushing stocks to unwittingly stupid people ... read the tweet over again
4182 2018-03-01 01:28:47 Do they need to be adopted as actual currency ? I mean, they don't look like currencies : they look more like stocks right now.
4183 2018-03-01 01:28:47 Like banning bump stocks, that just puts a bandaid on the problem.    There are plenty of semi automatic handguns that could be just as deadly in the confines of a hallway or a crowd.  
There needs to be a better screening process before ANY gun is allowed to be purchased.
4184 2018-03-01 01:27:11 When shoe shine boy gives you stock market advice it's time get out markets.
When Zerohedge compares US $ to monolpy money it's time get out of stocks bonds & fiat.. if you don't see this.. ............ well...............
4185 2018-03-01 01:26:25 > lethal. Ban bump stocks. Ban extended capacity magazines. Limit rifles to fixed magazines containing not more than a few rounds (maybe 5? idk, but low). Slow a potential shooter down and make it significantly more difficult to cause the same level of destruction.
4186 2018-03-01 01:25:49 Anong actions ang pinagsasabi nito? Eh consistent nga sila sa ayaw nila. Ask that to Rappler (stocks fake news atbp), Pnoy (Marami masyado di kasya!)
4187 2018-03-01 01:25:44 To all who think they have gun problem fix- ban guns, bump stocks, armed guards in schools etc...newsflash for you- We need to concentrate on the REAL problem! Fix the heart that has a desire to kill another human being! Where’s the love gone?
4188 2018-03-01 01:25:38 I have still never heard a compelling argument "for" Bump Stocks....

4190 2018-03-01 01:25:13 Banning bump stocks will probably stop not ONE gun crime from happening in the future. Ban them if ya want, but it will make zero difference.
4191 2018-03-01 01:24:56 you CANNOT accept the lame rhetoric we're hearing. oh well then the NRA will eventually agree to a concession that, for example, gun sales prohibited under 21 or no bump stocks. BS those things aren't the only problem. don't be played and DON'T BACK DOWN! We're with you this time

4194 2018-03-01 01:24:13 I thought he was only going after bump stocks. What guns does he want to confiscate?
4195 2018-03-01 01:24:00 Will any of his proposals keep a gunman from setting up outside the school and waiting for school to let out? Do they protect outdoor sporting events, practices, etc.? Ban automatic weapons, limit magazine size, ban bump stocks, do background checks, raise age limits.

4200 2018-03-01 01:21:15 Nope....My Gun stocks all did good. Obama, and the political lefts screwed up thought processes is what concerns me. Scream that Trump is Hitler, then want him to take their guns. The Crazy, is what I am arguing against!

4207 2018-03-01 01:20:26 Wow, just wow I hate to say it but I think the president is a wolf in sheep‘s clothing for gun owners. “Take the guns early and worry about due process later”. ...”your afraid of the NRA” ...” I’m going to write off bump stocks by executive order”I’m really sorry I voted for him
4208 2018-03-01 01:20:17 That's a device.  Automatic weapons are not being used in these shootings.  Ban bump stocks, it doesn't matter.  You can bump fire a semi-auto manually.
4209 2018-03-01 01:20:15 Actually, I think if we limited magazine capacity to 5 rounds, that would damn near solve mass shootings. You can have all the collapsible stocks, flash suppressors, and forward grips you want, but you have to reload after every 5 shots.
4210 2018-03-01 01:20:12 The Illinois House gets bipartisan support for a bill to ban bump stocks.  #GunO’Rama day at the Illinois State Capitol. @Busboom101
4211 2018-03-01 01:19:45 Overall, especially this deep into a bull market, no doubt, such triple-digit P-E-type growth #stocks will remain scarce. But one should generally focus on quality and consistency of growth more than P-E vs #sp500 #djia or #nasdaq #investing
4212 2018-03-01 01:19:39 I agree its straw... so - real world, Congress had the option of passing a law banning bump stocks like used in Las Vegas shooting. Instead they sent thoughts and prayers and then tried to move through a law making it easier to buy silencers. The OPPOSITE of helpful. Twats.
4213 2018-03-01 01:18:47 What a crock these stocks are!!!

4215 2018-03-01 01:17:27 freedom... every business should have it. If you are over 21 you should not be running out of places to buy things unless you want to buy an AR 15, or bump stocks and stuff like that. Otherwise the world has not changed much. Legal age to buy a gun is already 21 in some cases
4216 2018-03-01 01:17:00 Trump if you would ban AR-15 high capacity magazines, ban bump stocks, close loopholes n background checks it would b one of your greatest achievements ,think how much the students would love you their parents & teachers you would b a hero,if u can get Congress to do what u say.

4219 2018-03-01 01:16:25 I have a little disappointment myself.  I think he has to act concerned about school shootings in particular, which he should be.  But at the end, no laws will change except maybe bump-fire stocks, which is a joke anyway.  #3dprinters
4220 2018-03-01 01:16:23 I am a 2nd Amendment supporter I own firearms, I feel bump stocks should be made illegal we do not need them in the United States, personally I feel no one should be able to purchase a firearm before the age of 21! This is common sense.
4221 2018-03-01 01:16:07 obama approved bump stocks.
4222 2018-03-01 01:16:04 If the stocks could stop dipping that would be great thanks
4223 2018-03-01 01:15:36 The point is that many stocks are "manipulated" as much as $SRPT. And frankly, $SRPT isn't really that bad. That's why chartists love playing it.
4224 2018-03-01 01:15:04 Thanks for the comments, Qs! Regarding IBD-style high-growth #stocks in general. When market conditions are right, it is in fact possible for a few names to make outstanding gains even if P-E ratio is the triple digits. AOL in mid-1990s is one example.
4225 2018-03-01 01:13:42 Not a gun owner, but I love the irony!! Seems that every time there's a drill it has the opposite effect that one would think. Gun company stocks go up too. Maybe that's really the plan all along bc it happens every single time and "they" know it.
4226 2018-03-01 01:13:13 @realDonaldTrump  Mr. President, 2nd Amendment is a big part of that Constitution you swore to uphold. Banning bump stocks, I can live with that but your comments about banning firearms is really making me wonder just who you are loyal to!

4228 2018-03-01 01:12:35 #BoycottNRA
I don't want to take all the guns... but it's only sensible to outlaw the semi automatic assault rifles based on the velocity of bullets, high capacity magazines and banning bump stocks... for the same reason grenades are illegal : )
4229 2018-03-01 01:12:31 That's right & he also passed an executive order to ban bump stocks. What if next Dem president passes exec order to ban ammo & class of guns he chooses ?
4230 2018-03-01 01:12:29 Bump stocks were created for people with disabilities.Many who are vets.
4231 2018-03-01 01:12:27 Hey Chuck, were you sober when you tweeted this? “ Buybacks”. Do you mean companies buying back their own stock? When the price of those stocks rise where do YOU think the money goes? Does it affect IRAs, pension funds, stock accounts? This is bad because....?
4232 2018-03-01 01:12:26 Bump stocks make it inaccurate af. It is not an assault weapon unless it is fully automatic. And shooting a moving target at 100 yards isn’t the easiest thing. Would much rather have the option of defending myself with one than a pistol.
4233 2018-03-01 01:12:18 How about banning assault weapons? Bump stocks? Raising the age for purchasing guns?
4234 2018-03-01 01:12:16 They do provide an important public service in terms of making available stocks to borrow

4242 2018-03-01 01:09:43 Bump stocks: Trump is about to issue an executive order to ban them. I predict the same silence from the media.
4243 2018-03-01 01:09:37 Thank you!!!! They have taken thousands away from people over the years!!! Finally somebody that can do something about it!!!    We have your back frank! And a lot of us have evidence from other stocks and boards as well!   We have thousands of screenshots
4244 2018-03-01 01:08:54 Bump stocks: They make it easier to shoot faster with a semi-automatic weapon. It's not quite fully automatic but it's quicker than semi-automatic for sure These scary contraptions came into popularity and legal sale during the Obama Administration. Media was silent.
4245 2018-03-01 01:07:57 Why is there no “Stocks” app on iPad @Apple?  Seems silly.

4247 2018-03-01 01:07:18 Walmart hasn't sold AR-15's, bump stocks or high capacity magazines in 3 years.
4248 2018-03-01 01:06:56 Don't just stem gun violence, cut that shit off at the root & the root of all mass killings are the public sale of assault rifles with bump stocks & huge banana clips in America! Ban that shit for Fuck sakes! You sure don't need a brilliant mind to know how to curb that violence!
4249 2018-03-01 01:06:45 They haven't in 3 years. They also haven't sold bump stocks or high-capacity magazines since 2015 either.
4250 2018-03-01 01:06:42 Scott offers a classic example of solving symptoms instead of identifying and solving the problem. It must be made illegal for a civilian to possess semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks

4252 2018-03-01 01:06:26 @realDonaldTrump You would get a second term if you raise the age limit, ban the bump stocks and strengthen background checks.
4253 2018-03-01 01:06:23 Taking away bump stocks is not infringing on the 2A.  As far as the conspiracy, I really think the shooter (I wont say his name) acted alone.  Most of other info was taken out of context.
4254 2018-03-01 01:06:12 You realize they both still will sell high capacity magazine semiauto rifles. But people will feel better because they will have wooden stocks.  #FakePR
4255 2018-03-01 01:05:58 Freaking crazy ass people, and most of these, semi, burst, full auto, bump stocks, nothing but a toy in the hands of so called avid shooters. There is nothing accurate about these guns in the hands of a civilian. Real sport shooters don't use these. These are for killing only!
4256 2018-03-01 01:05:40 @marcorubio is making a mistake by reconsidering his position on reducing magazine capacity on guns and banning bump stocks. That doesn't work!
4257 2018-03-01 01:05:30 @realDonaldTrump finally one of those thoughts and prayers are being answered you need to t thank Dicks SPORTING Goods for removing the Assualt weapons bump stocks and high capacity clips. They are doing your job. You should do the same for ALL OF AMERICA.

#Resist
4258 2018-03-01 01:05:28 It's actually quite a bit when you also consider they haven't sold bump stocks, high volume magazines or AR-15's in 3 years.
4259 2018-03-01 01:05:14 Bump stocks are still legal. Like the one used in Vegas. So was that other option I sent you. But if you need some distinction then you do. Have a nice day.
4260 2018-03-01 01:04:46 I don't get too excited when Trump bends the stick sometimes during negotiation efforts. 
Look, if you're as armed & prepped as implied DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. 
Those who know don't need bump stocks. 
Be 'Clark Kent' sometimes & keep nose clean, know your enemy b4 it knows you.
4261 2018-03-01 01:03:58 Raising the age limit to 21 to purchase firearms of any kind is 1 issues. The second issue is Assault weapons, the ammunition for assault weapons and bump stocks. These should be banned for civilian purchase.
4262 2018-03-01 01:03:45 Well, it's a great sign that when the market was severely down today, one of the only stocks up was Dick's Sporting Goods. Thank you, Dick's. It is so refreshing to see a company that values integrity. I'll buy from you whenever I can.
4263 2018-03-01 01:03:29 Wow.. is that news? Ordinary cash and stocks have caused way more deaths in the past 100 years.

4265 2018-03-01 01:03:01 @TuckerCarlson Trump is more focused on bump stocks than illegal voters who threaten the system with support of the democrats.
4266 2018-03-01 01:02:23 From a man who took 30000000 from NRA and refuses to ban assult rifles or bump stocks that is rich!
4267 2018-03-01 01:02:18 If the pussy grabber in chief bands bump stocks or raises the age to by an AR-15, you racist mutha fuckers have no problem. Had president Obama made the same statement you fucks would still be going ape shit. @NRA
4268 2018-03-01 01:02:10 Actually, no its not. Because bump stocks arent illegal yet
4269 2018-03-01 01:02:07 I was holding 28 stocks back in September...it depends on the market and the chart patterns...if/when the market comes down, I might add a few positions...right now, the market is too high and there aren't a lot of smooth charts
4270 2018-03-01 01:01:52 I want fewer guns & fewer people to have guns & bans on high-velocity rifles & semi-automatics & high-capacity clips & bump stocks, but I also want a president who never belittles due process
4271 2018-03-01 01:01:51 Asia AM Digest: Yen Up, Stocks Retreat, Pound Down on Brexit News
The anti-risk Japanese Yen was the best performing major on Wednesday as stocks around the world retreated post Powell’s testimony. The British Pound fell on Brexit development...
4272 2018-03-01 01:01:09 @larrypratt Maybe you suggest to @realDonaldTrump that if he can unilaterally ban bump stocks that he should look to the same strategy to enact reciprocity and the hearing protection act...........my bet is the response will be << crickets >>
4273 2018-03-01 01:01:00 While y'all been bullshittin I been playing with stocks and shit it was a good day made some good investments but I need to do more research

4275 2018-03-01 01:00:01 Outlaw bump stocks and carpeted bathrooms.
4276 2018-03-01 00:58:58 No. We need to ban any new assault weapons purchases. Period. I can protect my home from a robbery. I don’t need an AR-15 for that. If you have one, keep it. No bump stocks, no hand grenades, no magazines holding over 10 rounds...real stats back me up.
4277 2018-03-01 00:58:52 @NRA -- the people of the State of Illinois have spoken. Bump Stocks banned. 72 hour wait period enacted. Gun dealer licensing act passed.  AND, we're just getting started.
4278 2018-03-01 00:57:51 "And don't worry about bump stocks, we're getting rid of it. It'll be out."  Oh noooooo how on earth will those in the USA be able to kill 200 rabbits in 1 min now?? sad day for weaponry, 
4279 2018-03-01 00:56:46 Any company bought by the Chinese will not have stocks held by me.
4280 2018-03-01 00:56:08 Don't forget about the gun reform that is needed @FLGovScott
 -- close loop holes around background checks, no bump stocks, etc. Turning schools into fortresses shouldn't be the only "solution".
4281 2018-03-01 00:55:47 Use this time to get into stocks
4282 2018-03-01 00:55:14 The fed. assault weapons ban covered semi-auto. rifles that accept detachable mags. and 2 or more features like: pistol grips, collapsible stocks, barrel shrouds, muzzle breaks, or flash suppressors.
4283 2018-03-01 00:54:32 He needs to stick to telling people how to lose money on stocks.
4284 2018-03-01 00:53:48 Are you asking me?  Because I haven’t said anything about them. This started because of ppl whining over losing a discount, not bump stocks.
4285 2018-03-01 00:52:17 And Jim Cramer also says he knows a lot about stocks but it seems everything he’s ever said hasn’t worked out. Or else he would be a millionaire by now and he’s not.

4287 2018-03-01 00:50:59 So bump stocks are dumb and ineffective I find It hilarious people are keying on them like they actually make an AR15 more deadly. The way you operate them makes accuracy nearly impossible. There are other devices that can effectively obtain a higher rate of fire.
4288 2018-03-01 00:50:55 You better include a ban on Military style assault weapons,  bump stocks, & high capacity magazines!
4289 2018-03-01 00:49:38 A tiny tiny element in my mind thinks he could do something because of how much heat he is under from Mueller- he could change the focus to gee, I’m a great guy banning bump stocks
4290 2018-03-01 00:49:02 They quit selling them a long time ago... never have sold bump stocks.   Haven't sold big magazines for a long time also.....
4291 2018-03-01 00:48:55 @realDonaldTrump You know well that bump stocks & age limit had nothing really to do with Las Vegas & Florida.
4292 2018-03-01 00:48:48 Well Hiltet did take away guns from civilians. This is what the 2nd amendment is for the protection of Americans from a government that takes away your right to bear arms
4293 2018-03-01 00:48:44 Sure, but bump stocks are legal. Sure that's not technically full auto, but it's pretty damn close.
4294 2018-03-01 00:48:04 What you Libbies don't get is that nobody cares about bump stocks. There isn't a single gun owner who even cares about them. I am shocked that they were ever legal inhe first place.
4295 2018-03-01 00:48:01 an EO on bump stocks will end up in court and not remove them from streets. YOU MUST force the your party to pass LAWS. raise the age limit to 100 YO!!

4297 2018-03-01 00:47:19 iirc, under the two-feature test of the defunct ban, a varmint hunting rifle like the Model R-15 VTR SS wouldn't have been included, since they don't often have grenade launchers, bayonet mounts, flash suppressors or telescoping stocks...
4298 2018-03-01 00:47:18 I’m pretty against guns as a whole, but obviously they’re here to stay. I just prefer they become harder to obtain, and that we somehow limit the lethality of them (ex. Magazine sizes, bump stocks, etc)
4299 2018-03-01 00:46:56 The country is in a uproar over kids being caught up in these school shootings. Mental background checks OK..Outlaw bump stocks OK... Assault guns banned until age 21. OK...but shotguns at 18 OK... Schools with armed security OK..everyone needs to agree on this
4300 2018-03-01 00:46:39 Oh and why were bump stocks singled out.. out of all the guns in that hotel room.. one had a bump stock.
4301 2018-03-01 00:45:14 Bump stocks did not kill those 17 innocents in Florida.  Neither did an inanimate object.
4302 2018-03-01 00:45:04 I know, that's why I think bump stocks are a good compromise. 
4303 2018-03-01 00:45:04 @realDonaldTrump
You're the boss NOW. Don't let the NRA bully you or allow its minions in the Congress decide to weaken changes in gun laws you talked about. YOU CAN BE THE HERO OF THE KIDS.
Goodbye assault weapons 
21 to buy a gun
Background checks
Bye bye bump stocks

That  Dick's is taken out of there store. #benferguson let me know if you here where the GarageSale is,I'll let my NRA friends know, and we will come and buy them all. I'm sure they're be going cheap cuz they don't want
4309 2018-03-01 00:43:02 Volatility ahead. Stocks: down first, then up to new highs this summer, then crash in the Fall-early 2019, then blow-off top to 2020/21, then complete collapse and global monetary system reset. Just my guesstimation, what do I know

4311 2018-03-01 00:42:30 PhRMA companies need to be made nonprofit, with no stocks/shareholders, who otherwise they are beholden to re: profits, rather than improving healthcare. But they are huge $$ lobbyists and "influence" (buy) too many legislators' votes.
4312 2018-03-01 00:41:49 Funny I thought it was gonna happen last week and market went up. Hopefully bounces off 2700. I’m not loving how my oil stocks were performing and I am in baba, but waiting it out
4313 2018-03-01 00:41:34 #BREAKING: Walmart says it's raising age to purchase firearms and ammunition to 21. 

Walmart stopped selling modern sporting rifles, including the AR-15, in 2015 and does not sell bump stocks or high-capacity magazines.

If Walmart can do it why can’t the Republicans? John?
4314 2018-03-01 00:40:50 Dear @Steam_Support,

Bump Stocks
Background Checks - mental Illness even not dangerous - no guns
No guns until 21
No national reciprocity
Wait until amendments are added.
#2A
4324 2018-03-01 00:38:37 Please put this out there, #BoycottRualKing they sell assault rifles, extra clips, bump stocks. Please pass this along. #FBR
4325 2018-03-01 00:38:09 @realDonaldTrump The 2nd amendment says we have the right to sufficient arms and ammunition. Banning bump stocks takes away our sufficient arms comparable to what the military uses that we would need to fight a rouge tyrannical government. You are losing my support.
4326 2018-03-01 00:38:01 Because frankly, I've never seen a president who actually tried to fulfill his campaign promises while lowering unemployment, improving stocks, stimulating the economy and returning our military to prominence all while having an undeserved 90% negative coverage by media.
4327 2018-03-01 00:38:00 But it's a really good start and more than congress has done so far. They also haven't sold bump stocks or AR-15's in 3 years.
4328 2018-03-01 00:37:50 All this banning bump stocks, and age to 21 is bullshit.  They can go to war at 18 but can’t buy a rifle? How absurd is that? So I guess every 18-20 now have mental illness.  I say they can join the military till 21 then. This whole thing is absurd.
4329 2018-03-01 00:37:49 Who even defends bump stocks anyway? Lol both parties agree there’s no need, I don’t even see the issue there 
4330 2018-03-01 00:37:30 Why aren't you making assault rifles and bump stocks illegal? That's what we want and need!
4331 2018-03-01 00:37:07 It's a ton more than congress has done. Walmart also hasn't sold bump stocks or AR-15's in 3 years.
4332 2018-03-01 00:36:34 Congrats! Great to see hard work rewarded.

Mansion/ranch party was great last year though. 

Watching you talk @070shake off the ledge was grrrreat!

Back to resource stocks.
4333 2018-03-01 00:35:26 Raising the age to 21 is just the @GOP throwing a crumb, like bump stocks. If it passes, then the GOP can brag about having done something. But, its not going to save anyone from getting massacred by an AR-15. #AssaultWeaponsBan
4334 2018-03-01 00:35:17 It's especially true with low priced garbage in my experience. Absolutely does not apply to real stocks with real catalysts.
4335 2018-03-01 00:34:01 Waste ammo and give a not so cheep thrill? Haha, they are, in my opinion, useless but from what I've read it's not really about bump stocks, it's about setting the precedent... that can be applied beyond what we are being told is the intent of this proposed legislation (HR3999)
4336 2018-03-01 00:31:35 I mean  what we find funny is when conservatives get mad about bump stocks. There literally shouldn't be any use for them. We have ARs and never use them nor car.
4337 2018-03-01 00:31:31 And this is a good start but should not stop until weapons like AR-15’s and bump stocks are banned.
4338 2018-03-01 00:31:22 @realDonaldTrump Changing the age of gun ownership purchases to 21 and banning bump stocks will do NOTHING to stop a shooter in the first minute of a school attack. If either passes, you will lose my support in the primary.
4339 2018-03-01 00:31:16 Hey Sean , lets just say the President makes it harder to purchase a firearm with strict background checks, banning AR 15, Banning bump stocks, changing the age restrictions, and securing schools. How do we keep firearms out of the criminals hands? Curious Tks
4340 2018-03-01 00:31:09 great perf BB, some little beauties in there, do you own any large cap divi stocks ?
4341 2018-03-01 00:31:07 Let it also be noted they stopped selling bump stocks and AR-15's 3 years ago.
4342 2018-03-01 00:31:03 Gosh!
Rees-Mogg, privileged, well-educated, speaks with RP accent.

The man should get his cleaner to prepare a scrubbing brush with carbolic soap, report to nearest stocks & give his mouth a good scrub.
4343 2018-03-01 00:30:26 @realDonaldTrump You need to listen to Dana Loesch.  The age is not the issue.  The mental malfunction will happen when it happens.  I agree with strong background cks and bump stocks but the age, NO, I don't.  If I'm 20 and have 2 kids, I want to protect myself.  NO AGE RESTRICT
4344 2018-03-01 00:30:23 @PapaJohns I JUST POSTED ABOUT HIS COMP.THEY R COVERING WHAT I SAID!WE MUST STAND2GETHER&FIGHT!BC HE STOOD4OUR#AMERICA#VETS#SERVICEMENWOMEN#FLAG UNLIKE OTHER SPINELESS CO.HIS STOCKS DROPPED!WE MUST BUY OUR PIZZA FROM HIM SHOW OUR SUPPORT!STAND TOGETHER!#KNEEL4FLAG#AMERICA
4345 2018-03-01 00:30:04 PLEASE include Bump Stocks in any legal changes being framed - you may get distracted and forget to do executive order and it is critical that it be done!  Why it wasn't done after Las Vegas I do not understand...maybe NRA got to you?
4346 2018-03-01 00:30:03 i've seen similar outrage over large fund managers holding shares of gun stocks, not realizing they're barking up the wrong tree. passive fund managers hold whats in the index. forcing the index providers like msci, ftse, etc to exclude them has far greater impact...
4347 2018-03-01 00:29:24 @realDonaldTrump straight up said bump stocks are out. That opens up the door for more attacks on the 2nd. Attacks that the #GunGrabbers need to further they’re agenda. Which is #islam . Get a clue #GunSense don’t give a inch.
4348 2018-03-01 00:28:44 @BassProShops PLEASE follow suit and stop selling ASSAULT WEAPONS, increase buying age to 21, stop selling high capacity magazines, and stop selling bump stocks!! #DoTheRightThing #ProtectOurChildren #NeverAgain     R/T if you agree!!
4349 2018-03-01 00:28:31 We know where Feinstein and the rest of Democrats/Leftists/Statists stand. What is worrying me now, is the Republicans and the POTUS who are caving to the #KillTheNRA narrative. They want bump-stocks/uni BG checks... the we want National CCW...  that is the compromise.... PERIOD.
4350 2018-03-01 00:28:09 that is the problem/he does not lite on an issue/leaves every issue that he brings to lite without his position/I watched the whole thing/bump stocks is the only issue he lit on/do not be fooled/Trump has every intention to "in fringe upon our second amendment rites"/no big deal
4351 2018-03-01 00:27:43 What really needs to happen, is @WhiteHouse needs to ban automatic weapons and bump stocks - outside of the gun range; if you need, an AR-17, you should be in the military or SWAT.
4352 2018-03-01 00:27:24 You are taking quite a bit of latitude here. POTUS addressed the things he would sign. bump stocks, long gun age 21 years,  background checks, school hard zones, & ability to remove weapons if person deemed risk to self or others followed by due process. None are Anti-2A

4354 2018-03-01 00:26:03 Bump stocks are actually dangerous for the marksman. I would never put one on my gun. They really are dumb.
4355 2018-03-01 00:25:50 Did you tell them about all the #NRABloodMoney in your wallet? Did you tell them you value bump stocks and assault weapons over public safety and human lives? Did you tell them you sold your soul to the @NRA?
4356 2018-03-01 00:25:31 You are correct but reciprocity as a separate bill will not come to vote. It didn't this year before all this nonsense. His statements were that NRA is wrong on bump stocks and the age to buy "certain" rifles. He accepted Sen Murphy's stats unfortunately.
4357 2018-03-01 00:25:07 European stocks fell on Wednesday as worries over US interest rates and weak consumer spending data in France hurt sentiment.
4358 2018-03-01 00:24:41 @abc7kristensze Regarding Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) gun ban.
1) DKS and Walmart raised the age to 21 to all gun purchases.
2) The Dow Jones was down almost 400 pts, DKS went up today.
3) Gun mfg. stocks went down.
4359 2018-03-01 00:24:33 Actually, if you were able to watch  the meeting that's not what he said. He's banning bump stocks with an executive order.He believes the age to buy a rifle should be 21 but he is leaving the decision about the age with the senators to work together. He gave his opinion.
4360 2018-03-01 00:23:38 Bump stocks use recoil of weapon. It’s still one pull per shot. Just that finger stays stationary. You can accomplish same thing w no bump stock. Ps, bump sticks suck I have no idea why anyone would want one.
4361 2018-03-01 00:23:36 Congress needs to get this done. Extensive back ground checks, ban bump stocks, ban large capacity magazines & ban sales of guns & bullets to people under 21.
4362 2018-03-01 00:23:05 Yes. They haven't sold AR-15's or bump stocks in 3 years.
4363 2018-03-01 00:22:44 Apologizing for America and Americans. We had to say happy holidays because it might offend someone! Kids couldn’t play tag because someone might feel targeted. But he was still the president. Now I see a man who puts America first! I’m keeping more of my money! My stocks are up
4364 2018-03-01 00:22:33 Let's start a boycott of these places and sell off their stocks. Buy stock from freedom loving companies with the money.
4365 2018-03-01 00:22:27 Just heard him say, "You don't need to worry about bump stocks, they're done."
4366 2018-03-01 00:22:07 This is a fantastic chart but stocks up so much since 2010....
4367 2018-03-01 00:22:00 US stocks fell on Wednesday as some soft economic data weighed on the market, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average snapping a 10-month winning streak.
4368 2018-03-01 00:21:57 I think these are big steps. They also haven't sold bump stocks or AR-15's in 3 years.
4369 2018-03-01 00:21:55 Wish they had gone as far as Dicks Sporting Goods, though, i.e. stop selling assault weapons, bump stocks, and large ammunition magazines.
4370 2018-03-01 00:21:45 Thank you for stepping up to support common sense and for prioritizing life over dollars.  

**Although, I think your sales and stocks will go up.
4371 2018-03-01 00:21:40 $SP3 getting no love, low of 27.5c today ! It truly amazes me the price action on some stocks at the slightest market correction. Market rallies for months on end, $SP3 get's worked. Market corrects, people dump it to new lows LOL. EV is <$9M (shakes head)
4372 2018-03-01 00:21:11 Hahaha! Super ridiculous! Only in America!!!!!!! 

More laughing stocks as you try to keep your bump stocks....

ROTFL......
4373 2018-03-01 00:21:06 They haven't sold AR-15's or bump stocks in 3 years.
4374 2018-03-01 00:20:37 We’ve got to reduce the number of ARs and bump stocks and high capacity magazines. We have to close background check loopholes. He have to keep guns out of the hands of those who are a danger to themselves and others. #GunReformNow #BanAssaultRifles #NoMoreMassShootings
4375 2018-03-01 00:19:50 oh hiiii. not sure on that, but online shops like yesasia, gmarket does not have stocks already.
4376 2018-03-01 00:19:48 I think the best thing about selling and buying back instead of averaging down, is that you break your emotional attachment to the stock. You would be surprised on how many stocks you will not buy back in once you sell. You should add; "never fall in love with a stock."
4377 2018-03-01 00:19:44 You could make a policy not a law. And that policy could be illegal. I’ve already conceded that the age thing could be considered discriminatory. But you don’t , by law, have to stock any product. A men’s clothing store only stocks men’s clothes...that’s not discriminatory.
4378 2018-03-01 00:19:43 It bothers me that today Trump said he would take care of bump stocks by executive order. I may be wrong but thought the justice department had previously said an executive order wouldn't survive legal challenges and that congress had to pass a law to be sure. Make congress act.
4379 2018-03-01 00:19:42 I think they've done a lot... more than congress has. They haven't sold bump stocks or AR-15 types of "sport rifles" in 3 years.
4380 2018-03-01 00:19:37 Pretty sad that you failed to Realize that Obama allowed this to Happen. Why Blame Trump for Obama's Mistakes?

Trump has done nothing? You have failed to do your Research. How about the Stocks? Deportation of Illegal Immigrants? Americans get's to choose their Doctors? (1/2).
4381 2018-03-01 00:19:36 I really hope target stocks the album for their next comeback. When I went today bts was at the front of the aisle instead of being on the side so if people walked by and glanced over that’s what they would see.

4382 2018-03-01 00:19:33 Not all investments in this case are index funds... They are institutional investors in the stocks. Some of the investments in gun stocks made by Vanguard, Blackrock and others were executed by decision making by the IM.
4383 2018-03-01 00:19:19 Congress needs to get this done. Extensive back ground checks, ban bump stocks, banlarge capacity magazines & ban sales of guns & bullets to people under 21. Glad to see you do not take NRA money
4384 2018-03-01 00:18:54 I love you President Trump but your anti-2nd amendment footsy you're playing with Democrats is a disgrace.  Our gun rights are not dog treats to toss to Democrats to play polotics with.  If you pass any gun control, even bump stocks, I will vote libertarian next election.
4385 2018-03-01 00:18:39 For bump stocks no, belonging to the Deep state sure!
4386 2018-03-01 00:18:24 Wow another investigation.  Seems like everyone Trump hires (hmm, I will hire the best people) is getting in trouble.  Take some first class plane rides on taxpayers dime, direct money to your wifes friend, buy stocks that you have insider information on get confirmed by Senate!!
4387 2018-03-01 00:18:15 I don't think these are small steps at all. I think these are big steps... bigger than congress has taken. Walmart doesn't sell bump stocks and hasn't sold AR-15's for 3 years.
4388 2018-03-01 00:17:40 After some research, might we:
- Please enforce existing gun laws
- Better fund agencies to do the above
- Have a ban on bump stocks
- Raise age of all gun purchases to 21
- Debate/fix the private-seller loophole
- Debate gun insurance
- Debate/try voluntary buyback program

4390 2018-03-01 00:17:00 For those saying the market is "crazy expensive", the S&P500's forward P/E ratio is currently around 17, the historical average is 16. #yvr #wtf #invest #stocks
4391 2018-03-01 00:16:45 Only 5-6 month after the Las Vegas massacre does @realDonaldTrump do something about bump stocks in much the same time period as his million dollar donation to the veterans during his campaign for President. It only took 5-6 months for Trump to write the check as week of shaming.
4392 2018-03-01 00:15:53 sp'2690s would be a basic retrace, and that isn't much lower. Most bearish case would be around 2630, where many individual stocks have key open price gaps.
4393 2018-03-01 00:15:26 He is listening to all sides - that's what he should do. He clearly stated, several times, during the meeting that he would like to see the age raised for AR-15 and weapons of that type, and ban bump stocks. That's all he's voiced on. Who knows what will be put in front of him.
4394 2018-03-01 00:15:09 Don't sign anything stupid that erodes our gun rights!  It's why  we voted for you.  Banning bump stocks wont fix anything, arming teachers and eliminating gun free zones will.  Making that worthless sheriff in  Florida do his job would be good too!  The gun fire itself!
4395 2018-03-01 00:14:58 I don’t usually mess wit food stocks like that
4396 2018-03-01 00:14:55 What do I own over the next decade if not stocks?
4397 2018-03-01 00:14:51 Assuming you actually mean this, I support this move.  You need universal background checks and gun laws.  You need to ban AR15 and the same, large magazines, silencers and bump stocks!
4398 2018-03-01 00:14:50 "I <3 Bump Stocks" bumper stickers sold out
4399 2018-03-01 00:14:36 Tomorrow I’m liquidating all my stocks positions because the stock market will also crash to around 21500 points.
4400 2018-03-01 00:14:20 No problem. He made those very options already. Bump Stocks were ok'ed by the idiot Obama. We will still beable to buy those rifles.
4401 2018-03-01 00:14:14 Dick's had the good sense to ban bump
stocks in their stores long ago. When bump stocks were brought up in congress before republicans piggy backed more guns in more places and tried to trade it for less bump stocks blaming democrats when they said no.
4402 2018-03-01 00:13:53 That's where the bump stocks, extended magazines, and well assault rifles of course become the necessary weapons to get their sick mission accomplished.

4404 2018-03-01 00:13:34 @Walmart How about removing these assault rifles from your stores as well, Also quit selling those clips that fire numerous rounds of ammo, and bump stocks, and lets not forget bump stocks. We don't need these weapons of war in the hands of civilians. REMOVE IN STORE & ONLINE.
4405 2018-03-01 00:13:26 @realDonaldTrump keeps saying “I’m banning bump stocks it’s easy for me to do that alone”
Well Donnie IF it’s@so easy why haven’t you just done it rather than keep telling us how easy it is for you to do. What are you waiting for?

4407 2018-03-01 00:13:22 I must have missed something - what guns is he trying to take? I heard about bump stocks and raising the age limit to buy, but what guns is he going after?
4408 2018-03-01 00:13:12 Omg! Please do this! Ban assault rifles & bump stocks! First time ever i have approved of your decision!!!
4409 2018-03-01 00:13:03 True @realDonaldTrump banning bum stocks means banning other part of a #AR15 IN THE FUTURE. LOOK AT #CA THEY BAN FEATURES THAT DOES NOT TO STOP violent crime. @POTUS this can lead to banning anythhing on a #AR15.

#wednesdaythoughts #SecondAmendment #SupportTheNRA #JoinTheNRA
4410 2018-03-01 00:12:48 I am boycotting because I believe the NRA needs to start moving forward. Legal gun owners should not object to intensive background checks and the banning of bump stocks.
4411 2018-03-01 00:12:00 Following Dick's Sporting Goods, Walmart has announced they will raise purchase age of weapons to 21. Neither company currently sells assault style modern sporting rifles, bump stocks or high capacity magazines.
4412 2018-03-01 00:11:56 Whiskey Tango Foxtrot! We give voting rights to illegal alien criminals. We refuse to build the wall so thousands of murders can come in, vote and drive. But @realDonaldTrump wants to ban bump stocks and raise the age to purchase gunz. I think I must be locked inside the asylum.
4413 2018-03-01 00:10:44 Tax scam? More in our paychecks, retirement accounts growing, we are the shareholders. Anyone who works and has retirement taken out with a company match has that money invested in those stocks. Poor talking point!
4414 2018-03-01 00:10:36 Yoo I was at this show. Not wasting money anymore after that comment about the economy not having a crash in 10 years. Save that money and buy stocks when they inevitably crash. Sustainable spending!!!
4415 2018-03-01 00:10:25 Big banks/funds are annoyed that people are storing value in crypto rather than leaving money in their bank accounts or buying stocks etc
4416 2018-03-01 00:10:24 Is it ok with you to sell AR-15s  to 18 year old kids?  Are you ok with selling bump stocks?  If you don't kill, you aid aid and abet by your  agreement?  Are you ok that a kid can buy AR-15s, but not vote?  Abetter.  
4417 2018-03-01 00:09:45 True. When I bought some stocks, my dad said “Don’t buy stock. You are going to loose money!” If I didn’t buy, I would never know how the stock market works. I’m glad I am a little risky than my dad
4418 2018-03-01 00:09:28 Chuck you sure don't think big. Any company that buys back stock usually increases their stock price. Most workers have 401k plans which are invested in stocks. Many companies gave bonues and raises. Now their 401k is growing. Go back to basics. Give credit.

4420 2018-03-01 00:08:58 @RepMartinDaniel Shame on you. Voting to arm teachers, but neglecting to consider closing gun show loopholes, banning high capacity magazines, assault weapons and bump stocks clearly reveals that you value the NRA and the gun culture over the safety of children. #VoteThemOut2018
4421 2018-03-01 00:08:43 Respectfully, you are starting to scare me and other law abiding gun owners.  Common Sense gun laws already exist.  I do support banning bump stocks.  I DO NOT support banning sporting rifles. You would be impinging on the rights of good people without fixing the problem.
4422 2018-03-01 00:08:30 While the bump stock does increase the rate of fire to near automatic, the amounts are not near 900 rounds. The highest points of rates of fire are just theoretical. Either way, in the beginning you did not mention bump stocks which puts it into a whole other realm.
4423 2018-03-01 00:08:12 I have stocks in both pitchers so hopefully they both perform and stay healthy
4424 2018-03-01 00:08:07 @RepDebraMoody Shame on you.

4425 2018-03-01 00:07:34 Looks like dick forgot.... people can spend money elsewhere.  Look for stocks to drop.

4430 2018-03-01 00:05:41 I hope everyone rejoicing the AR-removal Brigade realizes that these bump stocks and ARs will be prized on the black market and coveted by gangs and complete stoner nut cases.
Just an idle thought

4432 2018-03-01 00:05:01 “In 2015, @Walmart ended sales of modern sporting rifles, including the AR-15. We also do not sell handguns, except in Alaska where we feel we should continue to offer them to our customers. Additionally, we do not sell bump stocks, high-capacity magazines & similar accessories.“
4433 2018-03-01 00:04:41 What I learned from @realDonaldTrump today: 
1. He will sign an Excutive Order to ban bump stocks.
2. He will not consider concealed carry or national reciprosity.
3. He will not question bullshit statistics on guns made by Democrats.
4. He wiill go against NRA membership.
4434 2018-03-01 00:04:03 Exactly. They did lunch this past weekend. All part of the act.   $30M buys a lot of cooperation. "I tried, Congress shut me down, but I got you bump stocks".
4435 2018-03-01 00:03:58 Our young man can go fight in a war but they cant buy firearms at Dick's lol say goodbye to your stocks! I bought my last crap in your store. Have fun with anti gun fruit loops supporting your beliefs but buying nothing from there. Enjoy the social media purchases..they wont last
4436 2018-03-01 00:03:40 The books are here!!!!!
Ready for meet ups and shipping na ako!!!hihi  nasa shop din sya later hihi madami dami tayong stocks guys HAHAHA
4437 2018-03-01 00:03:05 Ek, Your tweets help me buying/selling ETFs/Stocks. Keep tweeting . Thanks!
4438 2018-03-01 00:03:02 Dear fellow Americans, please let @DICKS know we appreciate the sporting goods store owners/CEO for deciding to choose the sanctity of American lives over money by not selling AR-15s and bump stocks. The company is being threatened w/the loss of tax cuts.
4439 2018-03-01 00:01:35 legal age is 18. Wal-Mart has banned selling AR-15s since 2015. They don't sell stocks, hand guns, or any high velocity rounds either. But now no matter what you can't buy anything if you're under 21.
4440 2018-03-01 00:01:32 ... In 2015 it stopped selling AR-15’s. Also, does not sell bump stocks. If Walmart can, why can’t everyone else?
4441 2018-03-01 00:01:21 Tax scam? More in our paychecks, retirement accounts growing, we are the shareholders. Anyone who works and has retirement taken out with a company match has that money invested in those stocks. Poor talking point!
4442 2018-03-01 00:01:14 They’re still legal to own as long as they were made before 1986, but yes you’re right civilians can’t purchase automatic weapons legally. I think we need to drastically limit any weapons that’s can allow the destruction we’ve seen lately as well as modifications like bump stocks

4445 2018-03-01 00:00:57 He committed to get rid of bump stocks. Nobody GAF about them anyway. You can't ban rubber bands.
4446 2018-03-01 00:00:53 If a sick shooter mass shoots with the aid of bump stock, the intelligent response is to equip potential victims with bump stock enabled rifles; not to make bump stocks illegal altogether; makes sense, @IAMMGraham? @ghook @ciarakellydoc @realmadrid #FloridaSchoolShooting @bdutt
