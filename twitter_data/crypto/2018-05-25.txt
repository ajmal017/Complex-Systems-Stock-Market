3 2018-05-26 23:58:50 Yes. Indeed Russia has a huge potential in crypto.
4 2018-05-26 23:58:39 @officialmcafee @Blockchain_Jay Projects like SOV made their coin a legal tender backed by the Marshall Islands  Gov... do you think we’ll see more of this before mainstream? Or will law be created avoiding capital gains tax when currently using crypto as currency?
5 2018-05-26 23:58:29 I would argue that that specific “incentive” isn’t as attractive as many think it is.

The suicide rate would sky-rocket within ~1000 years.
6 2018-05-26 23:58:26 So you really retired from intel to make millions tax free on crypto eh? JK but again we're all of course very interested to see what you release.
7 2018-05-26 23:58:26 But for real if we got Justin Timberlake in because of that it would all be worth it
8 2018-05-26 23:58:22 I am interested in any previous poll. Furthermore I want specific age ranges. <21 , 22-29 , 30-39 , >40

10 2018-05-26 23:57:29 This drunk dude is talking about crypto and AI right now talking about how rich he is to another guy who also apparently did the same thing, the first guy just bought the other dude drinks... let’s see where this goes. $crypto
11 2018-05-26 23:57:02 I like the idea of the project, I think that the project will be implemented in the crypto world, but a lot depends on large investors.Very interesting and creative project!This project will reach big victories!

18 2018-05-26 23:56:31 @samouraiwallet doesn’t work with iPhone. When is that coming?
19 2018-05-26 23:56:29 I can’t get on the $btc maximalist chain b/c I absolutely love researching new blockchain applications and accessing my different crypto funds 24/7, I think there will always be a place for different types of cryptos (currency, utility, security)
20 2018-05-25 23:59:52 Most people don't.
Forex absolutely destroys most.
I've seen so many people get absolutely rekt in those markets it's not even funny.
Crypto is an easy market but it won't stay that way forever.
21 2018-05-25 23:59:38 at least @officialmcafee has my back on my #bitcoin prediction. TA says 14-15k by mid-june. the rest of y'all can go suck a fat di...**censored for profanity**
22 2018-05-25 23:59:33 You’ve got two options BBB; DYOR and get in, or jump on the FOMO train.

32 2018-05-25 23:57:56 I never understood people that flaunted depreciating assets like cars and clothes. Flaunt your LLC.. or your crypto investments or your credit or investment property ... #blackexcellence

36 2018-05-25 23:57:14 Oh shit, my follower count is going back up. Did Twitter actually manage to fix whatever it was they fucked up?
37 2018-05-25 23:57:05 I would *hope* @HalongMining built their miners with such a backup algorithm. But I haven't confirmed it.
38 2018-05-25 23:57:04 If people can make a good living out of Forex why not crypto?
39 2018-05-27 23:59:56 I’d absolutely love more info on this for the here and now! I’m not sure how comfortable you are sharing but, I’m extremely interested in your idea. It’s touched my heart so deeply! If not only for that, thank you! Maybe we can DM! I’d love to send a child to school

42 2018-05-27 23:59:23 Good analysis. Thank you!
43 2018-05-27 23:59:00 What’s the relevance of this comment?
44 2018-05-27 23:58:58 Also: Bitcoin's failed rally at Consensus. Facebook announcing it's own crypto has weighed heavily on the market and Bitcoin Gold hacked!
45 2018-05-27 23:58:47 Hey @redsteeze . I don't agree with a lot of your politics but I follow you (amongst others) to keep myself grounded. Thanks for pointing out that story was from 2014.
46 2018-05-27 23:58:36 Hey Rock. You still bullish on crypto?
47 2018-05-27 23:58:03 Don’t know bout y’all, but I’m just trying to learn and spread #crypto, while being a good person..
48 2018-05-27 23:57:59 There is a huge chance that big exchanges start listing electroneum and has not been disclosed yet until blockchain major update is successfully implemented. Huge!
49 2018-05-27 23:57:48 3 year bear trend? Where did you learn how to count man? Go back to school.
