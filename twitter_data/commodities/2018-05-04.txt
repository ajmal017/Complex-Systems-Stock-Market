5 2018-05-06 23:08:06 It’s possible, sure.  But I’m in the camp that dollar will get much stronger over next couple years.  I don’t think commodities will fly off the shelves in that scenario.

It can be the best garbage among a sea of other toxic garbage.

Can you say the same thing measuring that Dollar against commodities?

39 2018-05-06 20:48:42 In a capitalist structure that commodities information and information is interesting when it bleeds (Jschool reference) then you end up with coverage. There isn’t a solution in a society that only requires functional knowledge to make a money.
40 2018-05-06 20:36:16 Commodities are the opium of the people.
41 2018-05-06 20:21:18 Pero las commodities si se basaban en ese dolar y son fundamentales.
También podías conseguir dólar ahorro a 12.
Lo del valor de jubilación está mal era menos pero con todos los ajustes y aumentos, quita de remedios, etc es claro que los abuelos están peor.
42 2018-05-06 20:09:23 Um, they aren’t communist and you’re still probably talking about cheap silicon cells. Really, I know my business. I don’t deal in commodities for the consumer solar market, but thanks.
43 2018-05-06 20:02:18 Rashtrapati is always sleeping on matters concerning the country. Is he a BJP karyakarta or President of India. Prices of essential commodities have risen 200%, Banks duped, communal tension, child rapes on rise, instead of condemning he is hosting award functions. #Sadplight
44 2018-05-06 19:49:41 cash is quite stable (net inflation).. gold (and bitcoin) great fluctuation like investment (stocks, commodities)..
45 2018-05-06 19:39:47 Wena. My stomach is turning. What really happened to it takes a village to raise a child?? These days little kids are raped. Murdered. Traded like commodities. This is sick.

48 2018-05-06 19:30:46 I’m under no burden to provide any proof for Williamson’s argument, because I’m not the one attacking it. Maybe if you ramp up the dosage on your Metamucil, you might be able to cobble together an effective line of attack, Retired Commodities Guy.
49 2018-05-06 19:13:49 I remember commodities like sugar when the person in front of me is buying it.
50 2018-05-06 19:07:20 False equivalency: women are NOT property or commodities to be redistributed.
51 2018-05-06 19:06:47 I think so , where exactly I'm Zimbabwe are women traded as commodities? I support him bug maybe he shld tone down or share his jokes with his advisors before offending people!

53 2018-05-06 18:59:28 Agree. He's never been interested in commodities, and that's the closest allegory for crypto assets at the moment.
54 2018-05-06 18:58:29 oh, absolutely.  i should have been more clear -- i have nothing against the theory, as implemented as a choice-based vehicle for commodities; that is, you work for things you want but don't need.  the system as it stands requires exploitation.
55 2018-05-06 18:57:38 I think Frances explained it to you. Redistribution of wealth arguments are because wealth is an asset - a commodity. It's traded. That's why comparing the two is inferring women are also commodities. Also, people argue for the redistribution of wealth because often those that...
56 2018-05-06 18:49:26 Why would you think we can easily do 10%? The last time we did +10% (during gnu) was due to external factors (mainly gold boom) this time commodities not quite in favour and we don't have a strong export base.
57 2018-05-06 18:43:18 Too many people treat their friendships like business transactions. People are no longer complicated beings that need a lot of consideration and care. They are commodities that become worthless once they have outlived their use.
58 2018-05-06 18:43:05 what Buffett said yesterday at Berkshire shareholder hoedown - not buying anything presently because EVERYTHING (stocks, bonds, commodities) is over-priced

60 2018-05-06 18:40:54 Just mosque, is that one development..... no light... commodities are so expensive.... and you talk mosque... am not surprise even Satan goes to church...
61 2018-05-06 18:27:15 Definitely, that’s a big thing on the horizon, which will have its own big weight on the commodities starting next week. I think the deadline is May 12th for the Europeans to rectify the claimed “flaws”. 

Thanks for the comment.
62 2018-05-06 18:25:06 Trade with these commodities is currently dominated by USD and that means every exporting country is at the mercy of Washington until international trade is done using a different currency.

64 2018-05-06 18:13:10 I like to demonstrate the real expensiveness of oil compared to other commodities of necessity, average folks and financial experts have no idea how much is in a barrel, the mainstream wallstreet propaganda  is barking 24/7 it is impossible that oil will be expensive again.
65 2018-05-06 18:03:59 @AnnaAnnasvahn  hade inte du skrivit något inlägg där du går igenom alternativ för att exponera sig mot commodities? Hade blivit väldigt tacksam om du ville länka! :)
66 2018-05-06 18:00:48 Five to watch out for this week:
1. Results of US-China trade talks
2. US inflation data
3. Fed speakers
4. Earnings season (the last Batch) 
5. BOE policy announcement
6. China trade figures

All above will influence the direction of the FX and commodities markets this week.
67 2018-05-06 17:58:49 Seeing a lot of bullish individual stock chart patterns, and liking the look of $IWM and $SPY, but many of the sector ETF charts still need some work. Oil/commodities, semis, software is where I'm focusing attention.
68 2018-05-06 17:56:39 Completely agree with @vinayshuklas . Mcx already operates till. Infact bse is starting commodities exchange will will dent their volumes and pricing
69 2018-05-06 17:55:27 Y do u think ppl will start trading in commodities just coz timings for equity will be extended ? It's a different ball game

77 2018-05-06 17:31:24 3 white soldiers on $dxy weekly. Buy the pullback over next few wks. If BO plays out, commodities and EMs go on sale, might get ugly b4 generational opportunity
78 2018-05-06 17:17:57 Considering how much of the world is organised by computer algorithms, deciding which films get made, which commodities get sold, which power stations switch on, we might sleep walk into serving robot overlords without ever realising it. It might be happening right now.
79 2018-05-06 17:17:32 And this is a masterful balancing act that I rarely see discussed. A fraction of 1% of the population absorbs so much and vast sums leave the country by way of black market commodities (Drugs)..It keeps us from seeing/feeling/gauging just how much the #FederalReserve is printing
80 2018-05-06 17:16:29 I think the scams before Modis reign was less than now and price of commodities were 
less before now it is on hike.

81 2018-05-06 17:14:09 Efectivamente, en Bolivia se vienen activando placas tectónicas que se remontan a tiempos pre-coloniales. Sin ello, como argumenta @dcampanini, es muy difícil entender el fenómeno general. De cualquier modo, el viento de cola de las commodities, el ascenso chino, etc., ayudaron.
82 2018-05-06 17:11:06 Compare other rates also Mr. PM, who is looting high rates now in almost all commodities. 
Development in price rise only
83 2018-05-06 17:08:16 It means the devastated nation and state need no basic commodities like , Education,  Health and Rule of law but effective speech to entertain the audience. Great perception
84 2018-05-06 17:00:28 Fx is probably one of the few markets that isn’t like this (in most cases). 

Oil, bonds, stocks, broader commodities all look like the above. I.e wider osclinations from extreme to extreme
85 2018-05-06 16:57:31 Só país atrasado vive de commodities, ta na hora de industrializar o Brasil.
86 2018-05-06 16:56:10 Yes both BSE and MCX big beneficiary, but valuations of MCX is very attractive that's why i covered MCX

The traders who only traded in equity till now can trade in Commodities as well due to parity in timings, volumes can increase significantly with this move
87 2018-05-06 16:43:33 Inquiries in Manchester today were met with assurance that a sufficient supply of ham bacon is available to meet the higher ration coupon values in respect of those commodities and also to provide against the increased demand for them now that one fewer coupon can be used.

89 2018-05-06 16:36:34 So we are paying 82 rs liter petrol which is leading  price rise of all essential commodities. Nothing have been done. Only manipulation of data going on. What is Vyapam to lintel import.??
90 2018-05-06 16:33:10 É sério, vou propor uma lei que reserve um pedaço do Brasil para o experimento socialista. A SOCILÂNDIA. Ainda pedirei a doação de commodities, bens de capital e transporte grátis, pra não dizerem que tiveram que começar do zero. Daí pra frente é com eles. O que acham da idéia?
91 2018-05-06 16:21:32 Sex is, if anything, a service. It is an action, a verb, and not a tangible thing. The phrase you're looking for is 'the oldest profession', not commodity.
Commodities are physical things, like coffee, and gold.
'Redistributing' it is stupid and has nothing to do with wealth.
92 2018-05-06 16:17:06 If at all the same zeal was used in fuel sector basic commodities would be cheap,Petrol in uganda is cheap yet they buy it in Kenya,Long live @C_NyaKundiH and @MboyaApollo
93 2018-05-06 16:10:36 The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the more production increases in the power and size. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates.
94 2018-05-06 16:02:39 Ironically, the affordability crisis is caused by YOUR exact thinking.

You are treating HOMES as investments; commodities. Exactly like the #RE industry wants you to. You even want old folks to move, so you can develop their lot!

For many people still, this is just their HOME.
95 2018-05-06 15:48:25 As long as women are considered commodities, these Neanderthal comments will remain.   By the by, lets stop giving airtime to “incels” Or whatever these imbeciles are called.
96 2018-05-06 15:45:39 Obviously, you must not be aware that women are tradable commodities, like oil, pork bellies, gold, and frozen orange juice concentrate. The sexual 1%ers have been keeping them all to themselves!
97 2018-05-06 15:41:13 Nailing a picture of an actor playing a Guatemalan farmer behind the coffee machine isn’t the defetishization of commodities, Martha.
98 2018-05-06 15:21:43 Make women commodities is NOT a solution at all. Period. Take that idea off the table. We CAN help these young men but they have to change this entitled thinking. No one is entitled to sex with another person.

101 2018-05-06 14:38:24 'The promise of a world of commodities is the lure of neoliberal policy. But beneath that is a call to live one’s life as if one is not a human being but a business enterprise. The sensibility of an enterprise culture or a culture of entrepreneurism attracts people of all...
102 2018-05-06 14:37:53 As long as we view individuals as commodities, such as these dismembered chickens, there really is no bottom.

104 2018-05-06 14:16:09 ALSO (while I’m replying) “men just be better” and “make women commodities” are not the only two solutions. I dunno, setting up more youth clubs might be a good idea. No women get commodified, but men may be improved

108 2018-05-06 13:55:54 I want to say that I can't believe we're having to defend the idea that bodies and sex are not commodities, but quite frankly this is so heavily embedded in our society that, yep, okay, we'll sit at the basics still.
109 2018-05-06 13:50:49 Trump message to  China: Reduce trade deficit by $200 billion (means reduce purchases of U.S. commodities).
110 2018-05-06 13:44:39 Barter wasn't before currency. Before currency was household systems where commodities were controlled and shared within a "household" through different means. The only "barter" was of high value items like slaves and metal. Commodity barter came after currency.
111 2018-05-06 13:33:59 The price of codeine should go high o. Essential commodities are expensive in this country,  I can't be bothered for those who want to continue feeding their evil addictions
112 2018-05-06 13:25:08 "as a result of intercourse is not a commodity" That sentence - this segment in particular - doesn't make sense to me. 

By the way, recall Radin, Contested Commodities; Trebilcock, The Limits of Contract; Sandel, What Money Can't Buy (or redistribute).
113 2018-05-06 13:22:53 The whole “sex redistribution” fuckery is just a play on the ancient trope that it is women’s job to take care of men‘s needs so that the man is enabled to rise and live his best life. It’s every bit as asinine as it always has been. Not only are women not commodities -
114 2018-05-06 13:16:55 Yea I just prefer proven commodities over picks, especially late ones, I still think Landry will be a good PPR asset.

119 2018-05-06 13:04:58 I think the audience is underestimated when told they can’t imagine the depth of the evil.  

Farming people for their organic resources and sexual commodities, the sacrifice to alternate gods, and systemic mechanisms for slavery and culling is understood.
120 2018-05-06 13:04:41 Again, appropriation isn’t a negative or a positive. Commodification is an actual economic problem. Durags, Black hair, black music, black dances etc. These are all commodities of a dominant white culture.
121 2018-05-06 13:00:18 End your addiction to drugs by refusing to be a puppet, a social plant, a weed suckling on commodities that destroy your consciousness.
122 2018-05-06 12:49:04 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
123 2018-05-06 12:45:07 Lol I can’t let you play them dvds tho ! They was hot commodities 
124 2018-05-06 12:31:56 Headline inflation in Trinidad and Tobago was at 1.3%, year on year, in December 2017. Headline inflation is a measure of the total inflation within an economy, including commodities such as food and energy prices. This is a very low rate, not seen for years
125 2018-05-06 12:27:41 Being offended/oppressed r current cultural virtues & commodities They r cancer. When leftists get offended or claim victim status, they get the payment of feeling virtuous and receiving accolades/kudos from others. @ its heart, this is a narcissistic ideology cloaked in "virtue"

127 2018-05-06 12:26:55 Yeah, I'm more worried about it from an economic perspective. What happens to the value of rare commodities when companies can mine them in abundance?
128 2018-05-06 12:24:15 Ele pegou a dispensa cheia, surfou uma onde de alta de commodities, e com isso praticou o pior do populismo. Se juntou a tudo e todos que sempre combateu, por isso não passa de um criminoso hipócrita e corrupto.

130 2018-05-06 11:58:37 Wisdom/ Common sense are good examples of very scarce commodities in these times.
131 2018-05-06 11:57:05 Porque o Brasil é grande exportador de commodities. E juros subindo lá fora significa economia dos países desenvolvidos forte. Além disso, nossa bolsa em dólar está ainda mais barata e no início do ciclo bull. Payoff atrairá dólares independente da Selic.
132 2018-05-06 11:45:13 Tirando o efeito commodities, o gráfico poderia estar invertido?
Ou tirando o efeito da alta dos treasuries, a alta da bolsa seria bem maior?

134 2018-05-06 11:18:05 People are commodities that should be equally distributed?  

These boys & men are sick.  This has nothing to do with unequal anything.
135 2018-05-06 11:16:37 The showdown between President #Donald #Trump and #Iran will likely continue to be the main driver of sentiment in the #oil market this week, after prices reached their loftiest levels in more than three years.

136 2018-05-06 11:13:33 Don’t be so sure. The SEC is far more likely to side with Wall Street than with a few crypto companies. I think they are going to punt the decision further down the road saying “It has characteristics of both securities and commodities” which will just create more uncertainty.
137 2018-05-06 11:12:44 We all emphasize the likes/dislikes narrative. He invests in companies, others invest in commodities. He could be more open to blockchain(probably is), but he’s anti-gold, etc. He’s not accounting for the decline of $USD, but we can’t all be right every time, can we?

139 2018-05-06 10:52:25 Why both sides of the #auspol spectrum treat our natural resources, environment & citizens with such contempt it's borderline negligence or criminal. We look like #RejectShop country to global business; all the big commodities, at the cheapest prices (tax free at times)
140 2018-05-06 10:31:28 Good. Pl make sure commodities reach ground. Have a governance to check on this every month. Go to transaction.
141 2018-05-06 10:24:01 You produce to global demand trend, not just produce for the sake of it. The latter is done in Africa. So we have excess in some commodities (e.g. burn Cocoa) and have shortages in others. Because we don't produce to global demand and are not scientific about anything.
142 2018-05-06 10:21:51 What they fear and find intolerable of course--I mean the undeserving elites-- is a genuinely socialist democracy, which puts people before profit by limiting the market to commodities and not allowing it to control labour or money
143 2018-05-06 10:20:40 Task at hand: 
1. Find a trader (on twitter?) who traded commodities, forex, stocks and crypto between 2008-2018
2. On top of #1, the trader should have 5/5 same calls as Kaz from same asset classes

That's a short list of traders.... But there is alot of hay

146 2018-05-06 09:48:44 Since the green revolution, we the farmers have seen lot of wonderful technologies.

152 2018-05-06 08:52:48 Well, his harshness is achieving the exact OPPOSITE of what he is promising.

Depreciation of the peso, high inflation rate, increasing prices of basic commodities, increasing debt, etc.
153 2018-05-06 08:51:36 Fears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring. It’s easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-reputable commodities.
154 2018-05-06 08:47:47 I know Jacob. He has a good heart, a brilliant mind, and a great love for his country. He also has that rarest of commodities in a politician, kindness.
155 2018-05-06 08:43:24 i hate to sound so defensive but i was here when liking kpop was obscure and buying merch was relly hard, i saw kpop grow locally and across the west slowly with each year and more commodities be created exclusively for kpop fans bc we gradually became a real consumer demographic
156 2018-05-06 08:33:30 A society that fosters intense dependence on commodities thus turns its unemployed into either its poor or its dependents.
157 2018-05-06 08:20:51 Like successful boycott of murree & fruit sale... 
Can we boycott Pollution, Petrol, Politicians , Over price of Cars, over pricing of basic commodities ???
158 2018-05-06 08:14:46 We need essential cheap fooding commodities NOT GST
159 2018-05-06 08:09:20 That said, I am still on Tosaki's side. The vampires view humans as mere commodities, so they deserved what they got. It's not the SSY case where the queerats were oppressed.

Not to mention the many things they don’t cover or Deny in Claims. As long as we’re Commodities it’s
167 2018-05-06 06:31:07 Dont the experts always say whoever gets the best player wins the trade. Houston got a potential Cy Young Award winner. The Pirates got 4 unproven commodities who may or may not be serviceable only time will tell.
168 2018-05-06 06:12:55 I'm not certain what "listening to us" means. The Notely government has helped Alberta steer through a commodities price collapse as best they could have. The NDP didn't cause Alberta's fiscal crisis and they were left with the task of trying to correct it.

173 2018-05-06 05:56:17 This is the main reason why women are being abused and seen as commodities for commerce and objects of sexy. It's now better to marry every Friday night and divorce every Monday morning it's cheaper. No commitment at all.
174 2018-05-06 05:49:51 The military itself does not fit the definition of socialism. There is no means of production.

The production involved in the military industrial complex are capitalist companies subsidized by the pentagon. And they produce commodities and use wage-labor.
175 2018-05-06 05:49:10 Any partition without the counter effect creates a complex issues. Any Order based on agitation without time limit will created a demand continuously. Commodities exchange reduce the money usages. Any separatist leader should be discard by people and governments.
176 2018-05-06 05:45:21 Eastern Europe did. The Vikings on the territory of modern west Russia and Ukraine exported both commodities; there's an Arab writer who was in the region and wrote about that, can't remember his name right now. But I think Western Europe likely imported those things from them.
177 2018-05-06 05:44:53 Need ng filipinos job.low price basic needs. Commodities. Solve the problems first. Look for bigtime manufacturer smuggler druglord not small time only.many killed
178 2018-05-06 05:22:30 Pets are commodities for many. They buy one, when he doesn’t suit them anymore, they ditch him to the first shelter. Then they buy another one. I’ve seen so many rabbits abandoned after Easter because the owners pretend they don’t have enough time for their care. Bullshit!
179 2018-05-06 05:11:13 Goodnight Twitterland. Our Military and BlueLine are precious commodities. I LOVE them and thank them for their sacrifices. Everyone have a great Sunday tomorrow - show your love if you feel it. Sleep deep, rest well and love long.  BELIEVE.
180 2018-05-06 04:57:33 So he's advocating #ChildMarriage - a union which deprives girls the right to education and opportunity, besides exposing them to health-related issues and a lifetime of violence. Girls are not economic commodities to be traded off to the highest bidder.
181 2018-05-06 04:57:11 "In most industries profit is a reasonable driving force for a business.  But when the commodities are animals, the factories are the earth itself, and the products consumed, the stakes are not the same, and the thinking cannot be the same" - Nicolette Niman #paradigmvegan #vegan
182 2018-05-06 04:55:48 These guys really, really DO NOT GET that sex is being denied to them because of their nasty personality & behaviour.

It’s nothing to do with what they look like!
They talk about women as commodities, providing sex as a service. They do not understand respectful relationships.
183 2018-05-06 04:41:45 I've seen it with my own eyes today. Certainty sways most people! in another word - it is a rare emotional commodity as diamond is in physical commodities.. rare very rare that people get strong magnate effect to it... GO figure!!
184 2018-05-06 04:31:36 Yes, it’s about erasing consent. The women are commodities, not just the sex.
185 2018-05-06 04:28:33 We live in the age of capitalism & the age of money. All things can be turned into a commodity, and all commodities are for sale.
186 2018-05-06 04:18:46 Further, according to Spanish+other writings concerning the region, one of the main trade commodities in the dotted-line regions was slavery.  Chicks for guns.  CHicks for supplies.  Chicks for food.  That chinese industry lasted hundreds of years until WW2.

189 2018-05-06 03:19:34 "unequal distribution of sex"

Women aren't commodities, if you want to get laid so badly you can jack yourself off or support your local prostitute financially, because women don't owe you the right to have sex with them

194 2018-05-06 02:47:37 Of course he thinks this in a contract year. Unfortunately he’s subpar, but LT that don’t get hurt are valued commodities. He often killed crucial drives with penalties. Not impressed with the man from Penn State. Would love to hear Beckles opinion of #76sir.
195 2018-05-06 02:43:04 Bueno, la teoría del 'valor trabajo' no es suya: "Labour is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities". —Smith, Adam, WN, I,V, [44]. #Marx200
196 2018-05-06 02:40:56 The value of commodities per unit (e) falls faster than wage commodities required (q) rises. Thus real wages increases, value of labor power falls, and standards of living rises.
197 2018-05-06 02:39:48 Those bailouts were suppose to go into loans for the American people. Greedy banks invested in commodities/food tripled in price.
198 2018-05-06 02:33:46 They couldn't do that, many of the largest accounts on here do the exact same thing in the name of social media marketing. It brings in significant ad revenue for them, they're not going to risk that. Twitter is well aware that fake personas are bought and sold as commodities.
199 2018-05-06 02:33:19 The year is 2028. 99% of all tangible commodities are delivered via monthly subscription boxes.
200 2018-05-06 02:20:40  And what would happen to size of that legal liability if commodities rose 3-5x or more in the coming 2-3 years and they has continued to use ETFs? 
Now it's just an "unsecured" debt note likely on some affiliate entity's books, Enron Raptor style.
201 2018-05-06 02:15:10 Its also very disturbing to note how UNESCO officials have become overpaid bureaucrats living the high life enjoying all their perks and privileges while the money that they earn should have gone to effectively help those millions in need of basic commodities & humanitarian aid
202 2018-05-06 02:12:41 Jews, the chosen people without resources and commodities,  this is why they sailed to enslave murder and plunder, well known for their sly and devious manners which are considered to be highly intelectual, the olive tree was given for them to shit smoothly on the rest of mankind
203 2018-05-06 02:02:17 securitizing other commodities (oil, pork, etc) doesn't have this problem because they're consumed. The permanent nature of art makes securitizing it weird. 

Natively rare digital art (crypto-art) is the better starting point to solving democratization.
204 2018-05-06 02:01:02 It's a amoral day for commodities, wouldn't you agree?
205 2018-05-06 01:49:54 Yes, it does I've already told you, please learn English, you can't read. I'll try once more. 
The economic system as you defined it yourself allows for commodities to be TRADED for PROFITS, such commodities can be slaves, in this case they are, this is an example of capitalism.
206 2018-05-06 01:49:26 No one said anything about commodities   You can only distribute something one time so to redistribute it must already be in someone else’s possession
207 2018-05-06 01:49:19 To quote from Gann’s classic book - How to make profits from commodities, “When you make one to three trades that show losses, whether they are small or large, something is wrong with you and not the market.”
208 2018-05-06 01:34:34 If they are in Farm country and soy beans pork wheat and other commodities are the back bone of these states and they deny farmers any aid who eventually will be facing everything they worked for go down the drain they will not be fooled again
209 2018-05-06 01:32:27 Google "define: redistribute". The concept isn't limited to commodities.

211 2018-05-06 01:25:30 $11 USD cheaper on GDAX. Did someone say "arbitrage"? 
ar·bi·trage
noun
1.
the simultaneous buying and selling of securities, currency, or commodities in different markets or in derivative forms in order to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset.
212 2018-05-06 01:18:22 incels treat women like commodities and then proceed to complain they don't "get" "their" women
well, for starters, women aren't things to be "acquired"
213 2018-05-06 01:03:46 no the soviet planning was flawed because they didnt have the technology in order to abolish money. that is why the soviet model was inefficient by your definition because factories had to be given output goals which was difficult with many commodities.
214 2018-05-06 00:56:51 Mark T didn’t say that. The quote evolved over time and mistakenly been attributed to mt.  Mt supported kindness to animals not reducing them to commodities to satisfy a few seconds on your taste buds. Dead animals are dead. You eat death
215 2018-05-06 00:49:45 It’s only illegal if you are trading your own money and they don’t think you will pony up a grand a hour for a good commodities lawyer..
216 2018-05-06 00:45:35 Im sorry what? If im understanding correctly im guessing as a capitalist you would be for slavery? I mean imagine how cheap your commodities would be. until youre a slave but thats fine.
217 2018-05-06 00:42:52 like the literal thing is capitalism was meant for commodities.  theme parks and like, giant tvs and shit.  i have nothing against the system itself, it just shouldn't be applied at all to literal necessities of food, water, shelter
218 2018-05-06 00:37:44 Don't use women as commodities. They have equal rights and in sex too they must have right to choose their partner. But the point to ponder on is that why are they forced to sell their bodies? Poverty, slavery, sex rackets, forced?
219 2018-05-06 00:33:37 A rising inflation on the prices of basic commodities here in the Philippines will never be always a good news. In reality, it is a bad news, especially for our economy. That is the truth about inflation. If the Government can lower it, then good news na 'yon.
220 2018-05-06 00:26:25 Even if McAvoy’s ceiling is Doughty, you’ll still need another offense guy. Nobody else on this roster gives you that. I don’t think we have a prospect that does either. He’s one of the most sought after commodities in the NHL. I’d be insane to lose that.
221 2018-05-06 00:20:37 Working hard no longer equates to making more money. It used to in a commodities economy but in the days where value only exists in our minds, the people who make money are the ones who create perceived value, and that’s very subjective.
222 2018-05-06 00:15:36 people who oppose Marx are the ones, who have means to get commodities in life. Utopia is just a dream in the world of egocentric so called humans with so called humanity, who every time ready to do something cruel for greater good

224 2018-05-05 23:30:45 You can’t end it with “pathetic”, and then say “no offense”. They pay for their own materials, pay rent, tutor, lecture, act as counselors, pay for food, possibly for kids so even MORE food and basic commodities, etc., they work their asses off.
225 2018-05-05 23:24:56 They include hedge funds, private equity (typically venture capital and leveraged buyouts) private loans, direct real estate investments, commodities, currencies and even precious metals. Some include options trading, which can be used for hedging or generating additional income
226 2018-05-05 23:22:06 He has always made the same argument with commodities ‘investing’, including gold, for decades prior to bitcoin. I think a lot of bitcoiners miss that.
227 2018-05-05 23:21:56 “Cheap natural gas” commodities don’t stay cheap for long... current pricing can’t last
228 2018-05-05 23:08:40 He's not wrong, here, but the same comparison can be made for all commodities and rare goods. Not really sure why the crypto community would look to Berkshire for validation, they play a different ballgame.
229 2018-05-05 23:06:14 Right, so you're talking about very different commodities and asking why the first one "got cheaper" when what really happened is that it essentially ceased to exist.
230 2018-05-05 23:04:19 These other EU external borders are crossed by bulk products and commodities. The NI border is crossed by ordinary people and small business. Farmers with a few livestock, tradesmen working for the day, businesses delivering to retail customers. Totally different scenarios.
231 2018-05-05 23:02:08 Another stunning line @IANMCGUGAN @globeandmail: "In fact, based on the evidence since 1984, @GoldmanSachs calculates that investors should allocate as much as 80 per cent of their portfolios to commodities during times when the economy is slowing but not yet contracting."
232 2018-05-05 22:58:41 Courtesy of QE from 2009 commodities became correlated financial assets through passive ETF/Index fund investment. Every twitch in the yield curve was mirrored in commodity forward curves. I'm not paranoid: I simply understand real world markets better than most
233 2018-05-05 22:41:43 Women apparently have to be bought/bribed to prove they're worth something to a man? This treats women as commodities and dating/relationships as a mercenary exchange, but if you don't have any other source of self-worth it probably seems like a good idea.
234 2018-05-05 22:41:36 This is ridiculous & written so biasly. Like stocks & commodities, real estate prices can fluctuate,quite a lot. Why isn't Mueller looking into @SenWarren house flipping past, since we're now criminalizing investment savvy.
235 2018-05-05 22:22:30 A geração de empregos no Brasil passa pela industrialização de commodities vendidas in natura. Outra forma é aumentar a renda da população para que aumente o consumo. Redução da carga tributária. Mesmo reduzindo tributos a arrecadação crescerá com desenvolvimento.

237 2018-05-05 22:10:23 You seem to be being far too restrictive with your concept of commodities. If the problem is something with your head you need to deal with, therapy is a commodity. Recreation is a commodity. Anti-depressants are (of course) a commodity.
238 2018-05-05 22:06:47 What about it? It doesn’t make batteries or have any primary IP, and batteries and solar will be pure commodities.
239 2018-05-05 21:06:00 Access to pool and community rooms? There are some in Downey that provide that for $300/month but some have dog breed, tree type, and home color constraints. These have the constraints but no services or access to commodities.
240 2018-05-05 21:04:28 If they didn't view our bodies as commodities, there wouldn't even be an abortion debate. It should go without saying that a person and all their parts are not a buffet for anyone who 'needs' them, but here we are.

242 2018-05-05 23:30:45 You can’t end it with “pathetic”, and then say “no offense”. They pay for their own materials, pay rent, tutor, lecture, act as counselors, pay for food, possibly for kids so even MORE food and basic commodities, etc., they work their asses off.
243 2018-05-05 23:24:56 They include hedge funds, private equity (typically venture capital and leveraged buyouts) private loans, direct real estate investments, commodities, currencies and even precious metals. Some include options trading, which can be used for hedging or generating additional income
244 2018-05-05 23:22:06 He has always made the same argument with commodities ‘investing’, including gold, for decades prior to bitcoin. I think a lot of bitcoiners miss that.
245 2018-05-05 23:21:56 “Cheap natural gas” commodities don’t stay cheap for long... current pricing can’t last
246 2018-05-05 23:08:40 He's not wrong, here, but the same comparison can be made for all commodities and rare goods. Not really sure why the crypto community would look to Berkshire for validation, they play a different ballgame.
247 2018-05-05 23:06:14 Right, so you're talking about very different commodities and asking why the first one "got cheaper" when what really happened is that it essentially ceased to exist.
248 2018-05-05 23:04:19 These other EU external borders are crossed by bulk products and commodities. The NI border is crossed by ordinary people and small business. Farmers with a few livestock, tradesmen working for the day, businesses delivering to retail customers. Totally different scenarios.
249 2018-05-05 23:02:08 Another stunning line @IANMCGUGAN @globeandmail: "In fact, based on the evidence since 1984, @GoldmanSachs calculates that investors should allocate as much as 80 per cent of their portfolios to commodities during times when the economy is slowing but not yet contracting."
250 2018-05-05 22:58:41 Courtesy of QE from 2009 commodities became correlated financial assets through passive ETF/Index fund investment. Every twitch in the yield curve was mirrored in commodity forward curves. I'm not paranoid: I simply understand real world markets better than most
251 2018-05-05 22:41:43 Women apparently have to be bought/bribed to prove they're worth something to a man? This treats women as commodities and dating/relationships as a mercenary exchange, but if you don't have any other source of self-worth it probably seems like a good idea.

260 2018-05-05 20:41:58 Imcels believe sex is a commodity, like coffee & sugar & it should be given to them. They are able to get past the human rights of women because they also see women as commodities. Hence: no sex. It’s pretty circular. Sorry Toby Young, you’re a monster.

263 2018-05-05 20:22:49 Watching Bloomberg today. A lot of folks analysis depends on $usd returning to downward trend. $oil and other #commodities plus monetary policy and employment.

Analyst counting chickens. Never a good idea.
264 2018-05-05 20:12:49 it´s a mode of production in whitch "capitalists" own the means of production and direct them in order to create commodities, using workers that are forced to sell their labour and have no means of production, to sell them for profits on markets, and that is generalised
265 2018-05-05 20:09:28 How much is the dollar and commodities during Jonathan and how much is it now as of Buhari administration. PLS us ur mouth to count your teeth

Is what I would have been tempted to yell at them
268 2018-05-05 19:59:18 Animals are not commodities...
269 2018-05-05 19:51:30 But you've confirmed, Mr Magazeti. Somehow, in your 1-neuron brain everything else can get into and out of Laikipia West, except tomatoes. Trucks that bring other commodities somehow get in but tomatoes can't get out!
270 2018-05-05 19:50:44 "saw the new [Mariners] and literally half [the ballpark] walked out in tears I get it you like the [players] but dear lord do you think a trillion dollar franchise is going to give up their top commodities" Yeah, that scans pretty good.

274 2018-05-05 19:44:43 Don't you know that commodities like apples or evev eggs at times are imported from SA by enterprising traders when there's an opportunity to make an extra shilling? And here you're selling a lie that we've so much tomatoes in Laikipia and a dire shortage in Nairobi?
275 2018-05-05 19:42:58 @spectator @toadmeister There is no such thing as "unequal distribution of sex", pussies are not commodities.
276 2018-05-05 19:41:18 Paises con reservas importantes de commodities no conviene dolarizar. Se queda sin politica monetaria y nos resta aun mas competitividad en el mercado. Pq no ajustar medidas de Política Monetaria y Fiscales prenatales para ir acomodando esto?. La intencion generaría oportunidades
277 2018-05-05 19:32:43 Mr Magazeti, listen. I'll use example of perishable commodities (milk, miraa etc) As long as prices in Nairobi are right, the goods will have a broker/trader willing to transport them to Nai. A tomato selling for sh 30 in Nai and you believe we've rotting tomatoes in Laikipia?
278 2018-05-05 19:31:17 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
279 2018-05-05 19:23:38 commodities can be traded
280 2018-05-05 19:23:14 Yeah, really need to be in completely different markets such as forex or commodities.
281 2018-05-05 19:21:43 Buy commodities and Crypto. Everything else is in a bubble
282 2018-05-05 19:17:19 When Tina Fey wants to  buy  great commodities she  always uses HyperPuddin-brand Manufacturers for the best results.
283 2018-05-05 19:15:18 Price of petrol diesel and all essential commodities touching to sky also when u came in power.
284 2018-05-05 19:09:41 Kids love crypto.  Kids also love pop-stars.  Both are fleeting.  

I can only imagine if kids loved commodities...
285 2018-05-05 19:09:14 Its hilarious how these dipshit "economists" equate wages with other commodities, if 
 Mcdonalds says no you ain't getting a raise guess what, you ain't, its got fuck all to do with supply and demand, low wage jobs clearly deserve higher wages, its hard work
286 2018-05-05 19:03:32 Distribution? Are women's bodies just commodities for use by men?

Rape and intimate partner abuse statistics would point towards a good percentage of men believing women's bodies are commodities. 

Don't support them with this poorly written work.
287 2018-05-05 19:02:20 It's absolutely normal. Im shocked a "commodities" twitter account wouldn't know better than this. Pretty pathetic.
288 2018-05-05 18:58:17 Isn’t it funny that the same people who think “redistribution of sex” sounds good are also the people who lose their shit at the redistribution of actual commodities like food and wealth.
289 2018-05-05 18:57:47 To me what he’s saying is women are commodities, odious man
290 2018-05-05 18:55:57 phrases to avoid using in my presence:

1) "Dilly dilly" because its v. irritating
2) "Distribution of sex" because women's bodies are not commodities to be handed out wtf is this dystopian nightmare
291 2018-05-05 18:54:34 Women as commodities who exist to serve men. These incels really hate women. What are we coming to?
292 2018-05-05 18:52:04 Awww, he's pissed off -- like from pissing away billions in #OPM? I own $SQ  I would never get into autos. Call me when we have a pure play #Musk rocket company.  But even rockets will become commodities -- unless its a @RocketMortgage @Tesla
293 2018-05-05 18:51:07 Más hambre 30% más falta de educación los peores resultados en los exámenes pisa que lo que dejó el Kirchnerismo después de 12 años de altos precios de los commodities??

Imposible... búscate otro argumento porque con este vas muerto...
294 2018-05-05 18:46:45 Marx about capitalism: "a society where the commodity-form is the universal form of the product of labour, hence the dominant social relation is the relation between men as possessors of commodities"

how is syndicalism not a special form of capitalism with extra steps?
295 2018-05-05 18:25:52 They will feel loyalty if they are in the same boat. They will not feel loyalty if they are urbanite labor commodities. If the Chinese invade Japan tomorrow, 90% of Japanese will be completely unaffected and that's why they are unwilling to fight for their country.
296 2018-05-05 18:07:10 Marx has also given those of us in the humanities a useful way of looking at the world. In art history, Marxist theory has allowed us to view and analyze art as commodities, as well as situate the artist and subject matter within a larger societal context.

299 2018-05-05 17:57:19 Distribution. My daughters (and I) are not commodities to be distributed. Good lord!
300 2018-05-05 17:57:03 So we stand up for our human rights and make it more profitable to treat us as people instead of commodities. Alone none of us can make it happen. But together we are a power they cannot withstand.
301 2018-05-05 17:45:04 Excellence and learning are not commodities to be bought
302 2018-05-05 17:17:43 One gets to the viability stage of a Basic Income scheme when you reach a point of yield * capitalization that is greater than the pricing power of basic necessities. Reducing the cost of the core commodities is half the journey. Growing yield or capital is the other half.
303 2018-05-05 17:17:10 Once MAAS arrives, vehicles will be commodities and the profits will got to whomever masters the logistics. Winning at MAAS is all about local presence.
304 2018-05-05 17:13:03 The boobs are wise. They are essential commodities. Lol
305 2018-05-05 17:05:16 Cut drugs out of your life and you will no longer feel neurological attached to capitalist commodities.
306 2018-05-05 16:59:16 Academics are cowards who allow the capitalists to turn their minds into commodities, churning out new commodities (students).
307 2018-05-05 16:55:12 Congratulations, they have successfully transformed you from citizens into commodities.

310 2018-05-05 16:33:02 2/ Best analogy is to commodities I think.  It was absurd for investors to have passive commodity exposure 20 years ago.  In mid-2000s the narrative flipped and things like USO and UNG (ETF passive exposure to crude oil and natural gas) became huge.
311 2018-05-05 16:29:26 Because "equal access to sex" is code for changing females from humans to commodities to be distributed?
312 2018-05-05 16:26:55 Bofors during election....Pakistan during election....Ram mandir during election.....Tippu during election....

314 2018-05-05 16:14:56 And it was a huge job with three times the commodities required than usual!
315 2018-05-05 16:12:30 There’s a high demand for infants globally because people want “fresh” or “new” babies. That has created a market for children to become commodities.
316 2018-05-05 16:04:03 Becuz we all have to b segregated again, no sharing in culture and commodities in other areas.
317 2018-05-05 15:46:45 "food-processing...", yes, turn commodities into value-added products #extrusion #quality
318 2018-05-05 15:44:01 So, in the fallout universe, are the caps merely symbols (like paper money) or is it the gold, itself? Are caps the equivalent used in relation to all other commodities in the universe, or are they a symbol for something else?
319 2018-05-05 15:41:24 Gotta get these people hooked on something. There’s more money in it that way. Humans are commodities and the only value they provide is the value of their dollar
320 2018-05-05 15:35:14 I crossed some border, two blocks south of the 2 blocks south/east of the commodities exchange. In retrospect I really didn't belong there. I'll take half the blame for that one.
321 2018-05-05 15:20:22 That's because the dollar to quarter ratio is fixed by definition, unlike international exchange rates.

If I buy a commodity such as bread with dollars the other person has to hold my dollars, does this mean commodity prices aren't affected by demand? Currencies are commodities.
322 2018-05-05 15:19:48 firstly, Chinese commodities take high cost performance, and anywhere we need buy something maybe it masked MADE IN CHINA, perhaps perhaps u can`t see that. the other hand the TECH company is related somehow, the trade war may crashed some tech company, APPLE INTLE ect

324 2018-05-05 15:09:13 Nearly all economists said something similar. Comparative advantage worked for decades, but never saw a labor shock like 1b Chinese laborers and a govt willing to finance them.  This was the commodities equivalent of doubling the supply of oil overnight.

329 2018-05-05 14:51:16 Nice info. This is how I love people to get enlightened. A layman will get this Naira/Yen deal over prices of commodities.
330 2018-05-05 14:41:45 #ConsultorioElLobby Berco querido, no crees que el error de la economía argentina fue no haber pesificado la cotización de las commodities e inmuebles cuando se salió de la convertibilidad en 2002? Si se hizo la asimétrica se podría haber hecho eso @aleberco @ElLobby899
331 2018-05-05 14:33:11 Capitalism=religion. Banks=churches. Wealth=heaven. Poverty=hell. The rich=saints. The Poor=sinners. Commodities=blessings. Money=God 
332 2018-05-05 14:23:36 Gold from 2008 - 2011 was a 80 year boom for gold. It will happen again just not statistically soon. Commodities are very tricky to trade unless you have training in it. Gold is one of the easiest.
333 2018-05-05 14:15:04 It's not the usual business. U too can make crores of turnover in Derivative market instruments.  F&O,  commodities trading etc., And these are very risky financial instruments where there are chances of loss are high.
334 2018-05-05 14:11:50 Wait till the court orders against @thewire_in who manipulated and mislead people in it's article and presenting the data of commodities trading turnover as profit The day will not be too far.People can't be fooled.Those who don't know diff bet turnover and profit can be fooled
335 2018-05-05 14:08:09 IMO currencies - international fiat money - are more like commodities these days and we are losing in the “OPEC” game of printing money
336 2018-05-05 13:57:38 Gaddafi had tons of gold reserves and plans for his own currency. Once the bombs started somehow an exchange was setup to assure oil commodities wouldn't be recognized in anything but USD. I believe this came up in Clinton's emails, but was tellingly not the focus.
337 2018-05-05 13:56:43 Fake news. Anyone that thinks farmers can’t sell soybeans is either dumb or knows nothing about farm commodities. Beans were up .10 per bu. on day China anounced it. Normal trading so far.
338 2018-05-05 13:55:52 As a fiat hedge, I think it needs to be hard assets. Low LTV income-generating real estate, commodities, gold etc.
339 2018-05-05 13:55:03 Who & what will benefit most from deregulation of that restricts their freedom to profit from any and all commodities? Who and what is not a commodity for profit? The human species are commodities and consumers. Why not profit from humans consuming themselves as commodities?
340 2018-05-05 13:43:33 Interesting thing about this chart is it shows commodities almost always completely retrace their bull markets.

343 2018-05-05 13:39:47 The days of commodities are back. Get off the coin train, it has already stopped. People are scared shitless so every attempt up in bitcoin or whatever will be sold by people wanting out whole. In commodities, we’ve been through that, excitement is back. Trade the trend, son!
344 2018-05-05 13:39:34 FTFY: It is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. businesses depending on cheap Chinese goods and commodities. I can screw my whole base: working class consumers and multinational producers!

A chegada do café no Brasil se deu no Estado do Pará. Mas, foi no sudeste que se tornou numa das maiores commodities do País.
349 2018-05-05 13:14:12 I'm still thinking about the idea of women's desirability being treated as a commodity, more so historically, and how men protected their commodities with marrige contracts and constructed taboo's around sex outside marrige to enforce behaviour. 
350 2018-05-05 13:04:19 Thank you, this will be interesting to watch because historically falling EM currencies are not good for commodities.

For example, Argentina is the world’s second biggest corn exporter, and their corn is getting cheaper by the day on world markets, thanks to their currency.
351 2018-05-05 13:01:40 "Celebrities are visual commodities that are used by the corporate class to drug up the visions of the people."
352 2018-05-05 12:40:15 Your fear of life without drugs leads you to fear a future without capitalist commodities.
353 2018-05-05 12:39:23 Only an unwise person will deliberately disparage another person's culture. However, culture is dynamic and should adjust to modern realities. Women are not commodities, a bride price should be more or less symbolic
354 2018-05-05 12:34:22 Great observation.

It's not a static keystone, however. The USD's position, strength, and value (to an extent) rides the waves of the other currencies and commodities below it.
355 2018-05-05 12:31:08 #closeprisons. create a new economy. No one is protected in this criminal legal system. Employees of this cruel system are commodities like the people in the cages.
356 2018-05-05 12:26:36 My grandfather spoke of this.  I wanna cry, I thought he was old and senile and he only spoke Spanish.  He sent me to school & they fed us lies.  I only passed because my black friends helped me they helped him too back then.  Blacks and Mexicans were only commodities.
357 2018-05-05 12:26:03 @HayekAndKeynes excuse me to ask. Is  this a serious tweet or a sarcasm? I also trade commodities. Thank you to reply
358 2018-05-05 12:18:25 Wages?  Out of growing demand for qualified workers, they will begin to rise, but then prices for these commodities will rise too.  The reality of the "tax cuts" to the working class won't hit until they get to 2019 - by design.  It's after the 2018 mid-terms, deductions go away.

361 2018-05-05 12:12:09 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world.
362 2018-05-05 12:08:00 So perhaps smart money sells stocks regardless of new ATH’s ahead, holds cash position in Dollars.. Dollar rallies hard here, then  smart capital shift into commodities after that continues disinflation beat down? #DXY #SPX #Gold

366 2018-05-05 11:51:01 How many 3rd world people have been killed by capitalism? Exploitation of their countries is on going - cash crops, western demand  for various commodities leads to starvation & destruction of the environment.  At least social democracy stopped it in the 1st world.
367 2018-05-05 11:47:04 It's not the same thing. You will be squandering public money (and hence Canadians' time and labour, commodities they can never recoup) to cover up the incompetence of the Federal Liberal government.

376 2018-05-05 10:23:31 Capitalist production, under its a continuous connected process, of a process of reproduction, produces not only commodities, not only surplus value, but it also produces & reproduces capitalist relation; on the one side the capitalist, on the other the wage-laborer.

380 2018-05-05 10:08:54 When I was in primary school many years ago, KCC officials confiscated and arrested many lads selling commodities off Kampala streets. As kids we ate 'free things'.

382 2018-05-05 10:02:55 Exactly, dogmatism is the problem IMO.

I like Eric Schwimmer's work on the Orokaiva, which I found after I began to think about Gramsci's concept of intellectuals, Lawrence Grossman's work on peasant production in the HLs of PNG and of course Chris Gregory's Gifts&Commodities.
383 2018-05-05 09:50:42 I live in a close and almost every housewife has a table selling basic commodities either in front of their houses or small shops made of wood. Now they do this because of the little profit with which they intend to make contributions to the family's survival.

385 2018-05-05 09:41:29 The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilization. The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery.

401 2018-05-05 08:50:06 For those in my special subject if you are looking for some stuff on the commodification of slaves - The introduction of David Brion Davis “The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Emancipation” is very good for setting out why slaves were seen as commodities by slaveowners.
402 2018-05-05 08:36:16 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
403 2018-05-05 08:30:02 It’s a mystery... how outrageous is that us proles aren’t willing to become commodities for the pseudo-intellectual elite!
404 2018-05-05 08:09:43 The SK NDP fixed the Devine debacle and then the NDP delivered a string of surpluses and left a small surplus for Mr. Wall. He surfed along on the commodities super cycle until it crapped out and bingo, presto, budget cuts and deficits.

410 2018-05-05 06:42:10 Has @arunjaitley started having second thoughts on #GST a tax that with much fanfare was supposed to subsume all cess and taxes? He has appointed a group of ministers to levy a sugar cess get ready for demands from states for special cess across commodities. BAD NEWS.

412 2018-05-05 06:33:34 This narrative of just pointing out that African economies are commodity based should be exhausted by now, we need our leaders to come up with tangible means to integrate Africa into the manufacturing side in order to add value n reduce exposure to price volatility of commodities

417 2018-05-05 05:49:17 Historic acheivement. Now bring down prices of essential commodities and household items. The BJP will win the next Election 2019 if this too is done. And tell irresponsible elements in BJP to watch out their mouths when they speak in public.
418 2018-05-05 05:44:29 My womb is not for sale, reproduction  is not a commercial  process and should not be treated in this way. Babies are not commodities. Where is the right of the child of this to deeply know its mother and father?

423 2018-05-05 04:58:38 Aparte afirmar lo que afirmas es mala lectura de cifras. El empleo que creció en la segunda gestión de Cristina era público, el privado no creció. Y hasta 2008 la plata salía de todos lados por el alto precio de commodities y aún asi no se invirtió de la mejor manera

474 2018-05-04 22:58:24 I’m 42 yrs old. In the 80’s and 90’s we used to queue for bread  and other commodities when I lived in Byo. Queues where a daily occurance at CABS with shortage of money. Petrol shortages also started way before the 2000s. The Zim that We know has always been a mess under ZANU
475 2018-05-04 22:58:07 Why a big deal is ever made about USD and gold/commodities being negatively correlated? Obviously USD/x is going to be negatively correlated to y/USD. That doesn't say anything about the relative value of investing your USDs in x vs y, which is really the concern

479 2018-05-04 22:06:09 Yes, but the analogy at its core is flawed, as it's bidirectional.

Tressa has it dead right.

America can source from many nations, while net exporters will get juiced in it.

534 2018-05-04 16:43:21 You're not wrong. One thing the market does supremely well is provide masses of affordable commodities (homes included). The shortage is (as always) the result of market restrictions (planning so-called). PS I've yet to meet a successful developer who builds unaffordable homes.
535 2018-05-04 16:42:14 A system that distributes wealth more horizontally can’t screw your over. If you need labor to produce commodities to perpetually produce wealth rather than produce necessities...these will result in two totally different societies.

541 2018-05-04 16:16:49 Interesting business model, usually branded consumer commodities use "brand tax" as a large source of profit.

544 2018-05-04 15:46:43 Capitalism needs new markets to expand into to stay alive, and essentialy what we call tech today was one of the biggest since new markets meant colonialism. Skills and technologies become commodities and their prices get pushed downward.

546 2018-05-04 15:42:29 Keynes stole Marx distinction between CMC & MCM':  even in former there's a possibility of crisis that classicals denied. Crisis is panting after money which results from contradiction between commodities and money which alone has monopoly on direct exchangeability. @de1ong

576 2018-05-04 14:13:03 My take is that privy investors, including, legislators, policymakers, law enforcement, etc. [insiders], are playing both ends against the middle, ie, buying (global) stocks & commodities futures.

586 2018-05-04 13:43:55 Art and architecture are usually already commodities & in cases where they try to avoid the status a prize doesn't actually make a difference in these terms since there is no moment of exchange.
587 2018-05-04 13:41:40 The real market for this is going to be in genetics and refined products. As with commodities, competitive pressure will drive the price low for the base product.

"This is to notify you of a price adjustment will take effect on June 18, 2018. This adjustment  is driven by the recently implemented tariffs on raw materials which  have increased costs of commodities, especially steel and aluminum, by up to 20% in 6 months.
591 2018-05-04 13:35:38 I do not know if the "government" "induces" inflation. The gov't does not control wholesale or retail prices, nor commodities, nor even the public & corporate bond markets (Fed only has a parallel influence and is half the time being responsive to market trends).
592 2018-05-04 13:34:59 Borrowing billions of dollars and commodities in my name on my credit's claiming I authorized it. And hostaging me and my family now to try to force me to pay the unpaid 32 year debt'. Hostaging me for ransom' trying to steal my business franchise ' saying they'll release me' but

594 2018-05-04 13:16:27 On commodities, right?
595 2018-05-04 13:12:51 Climate vulnerabilities across value-chain commodities affect farmers. The financial and technological needs of farmers to adapt are therefore as critical as the mitigation technics to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of the agricultural sector.

702 2018-05-04 03:08:48 *ML Voice* "Yes, to a certain extent the progress of consumerism provides the accessibility to these commodities that Gertrude Stein would never have had access to. This is an interesting point, I mean what should we make of this?."
703 2018-05-04 03:05:51 How can ONE household receive commodities & an EBT card at the same time?? Systems screwed up!
704 2018-05-04 03:02:42 WHO SAID IT IS ABOUT MUSIC?

COMMODITIES

GOOD NIGHT, JARED
EU TE AMO, CORAÇÃO

705 2018-05-04 03:00:08 Agree. Regular supply of all essential commodities! Such a basic.
706 2018-05-04 02:54:08 the incels and other  misogynistic creeps all refuse to accept  paid sex, or even sex with "ugly" partners- they demand that attractive women have sex with them DESPITE not even making modest attempts at improving their attraction.
women are not commodities.
707 2018-05-04 02:45:21 During the 70’s many Health Insurance Co. became “for profits” and considered “commodities.”Their objective became profits.Costs escalated leaving many no choice but to drop coverage. That’s one big reason we should be studying how other countries provide health care.
708 2018-05-04 02:44:59 Sure futures are part of the problem.... oil, beef etc smh driving up prices of commodities based on a gamble - The Who thing is a scam !!!
709 2018-05-04 02:42:54 At least pay her $130,000. Commodities.
710 2018-05-04 02:37:43 I wonder how much higher Gold would Vault per year.  200 ?  300 ? 900?  As for Cryptos?  I would assume alot of panicking/volitility  and maybe years of a bull run in commodities
711 2018-05-04 02:36:07 La soja estaba a más de 500 ds x TN con esos commodities cualquiera es Gardel.
712 2018-05-04 02:35:30 I don't know much about commodities markets.  But I'm thinking if there's a way to invest in popcorn futures in D.C....
713 2018-05-04 02:22:49 gotta throw in a bit more than that i think. teams value flexibility and assets more than known commodities if they aren't all stars.
714 2018-05-04 01:58:57 I'm a subscriber and have seen all of your chartbook.  I don't understand fundamentally why stocks would go up from here, but your evidence shows likely higher rates, lower dollar, higher commodities, and higher stocks. Would it be safe to say we're going through hyperinflation?
715 2018-05-04 01:38:53 Calling them sad sacks achieves nothing. I'm looking at causation not outcome. As for viewing women as commodities, that again would point to autistic traits as them viewing women nothing more than a measuring stick. Men that get left behind by society like this are a huge danger
716 2018-05-04 01:33:03 I work with commodities. This will affect more than the farmers. But I feel bad this is happening but at the same time who voted for F*cker. You get what you voted for!!!! And to think he just sat and said “the farmers will take it like champs, it’ll hurt but suck it up”. FO.
717 2018-05-04 01:20:12 Empower yourself by fighting your addiction to the capitalist commodities known as drugs.
718 2018-05-04 01:20:01 Why do conservatives think that a serious rebuttal to any sort of critique of capitalism is "you have a phone so checkm8te"? It just proves that their imaginations don't extend beyond prioritizing commodities, which is ironic.
719 2018-05-04 01:11:43 This is happening rapidly. Soon most of Earth’s people will be breathing toxic air &most will die unable to afford clean water & filtered air. Then even those in power most readily destroying our home will eventually die in luxury bunkers of toxic commodities. We must change now.
720 2018-05-04 01:11:39 China runs deficits with certain nations in certain commodities; not long ago they also ran a deficit with South Korea I believe (& may still).  Not gold-backed CNY, but a CNY gold window of sorts is open in SGEI, HK, & Dubai
721 2018-05-04 01:09:08 and in the commodities market, pork belly futures are up 10%
722 2018-05-04 01:06:12 yep. It's an argument against redistribution. But he clearly thinks it's fun to make arguments about treating women as commodities. And it's not entirely clear he hasn't convinced himself that it would be a good idea.
723 2018-05-04 00:51:05 How about closing the geography gap? That would help everyone in the low pay regions to afford the commodities and services that everyone pays the same.
724 2018-05-04 00:49:22 I guess you don't understand commodities markets???
725 2018-05-04 00:44:44 It's funny you bring up the pay gap. The highest wage regions get 100% wages, but everyone pays the same for these commodities and services. That is the real problem.
726 2018-05-04 00:41:01 Not 1 trade policy has any influence on the oil cartels. Commodities are all about supply/demand/currency.
727 2018-05-04 00:35:15 I live in Swansea, London workers get nearly 100% more wages for the exact same job. This issue is seen across the western world but nobody wants to talk about it. The gender gap of 23% is tiny compared the geography gap when we pay the same for services and commodities.
728 2018-05-04 00:35:12 I notice that men are left out of these things a lot. Men aren't commodities either, and they aren't disposable toys. 

Every one's autonomy and boundaries should be respected.
729 2018-05-04 00:26:10 Everybody goes on about the gender pay gap... but forget the geography pay gap is so much worse. The cost of living argument is a fallacy because wages stay in line with house prices, but cost of commodities remains the same high price everywhere.
730 2018-05-04 00:17:21 Why don't they solve this by treating women like human beings rather than commodities?
731 2018-05-04 00:13:03 Scarce commodities no matter how flawed demand a price.
732 2018-05-04 00:09:43 Bullish commodities; gold
733 2018-05-04 00:07:48 Claro: Tripé macro econômico, plano real, moeda estável, commodities batendo recordes, bilhões de dólares irrigando a economia, crédito fácil e farto, uma maravilha. 

Aí veio 2012 trazendo a realidade.


734 2018-05-04 00:06:04 Naa I’m not playing stocks till after college. Just don’t have the time to do all the work. Currency, indices, commodities, well swing trade yes because illl be able to keep up with blue chip stocks.
735 2018-05-04 00:05:03 3189: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
736 2018-05-04 00:04:57 “Accelerating the process” with the front office of an NFL team always equates to taking less. Play hard ball and back up the brinks truck. Players are commodities. You know that.
