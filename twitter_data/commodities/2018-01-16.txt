75 2018-01-16 19:34:09 Definitely. We can't keep beating ourselves up over what we don't have. It's tough - our whole culture is about treating everything, inc' ourselves, as commodities - but far, far more important to be kind, supportive, creative, and passionate.

85 2018-01-16 19:12:50 Prices crashed. Not networks. The reason is simple. They all trade with BTC pairs.

131 2018-01-16 16:09:04 US Stocks, up...  oil, up... commodities, up...  Strong economy or the first indications of runaway inflation?  Fed can't raise rates and China is no longer buying bonds.  What's a trapped Central Bank to do?  Buckle up boys and girls.  2018 is looking to be quite a ride.

137 2018-01-16 15:47:06 It is so totally weird how we're taught to think of ourselves as "commodities" with "marketable skills", and to "be our own brand" and the result is dehumanizing each other, treating others like shit and using people like they're products.

168 2018-01-16 13:46:12 Again, it's just that the dollar is decreasing in value against the euro, so all commodities went up, not just gold .....
169 2018-01-16 13:43:32 Basically what makes the cryptocurrencies volatile is there are no Tangibles backing them. Unlike FIAT which has central banks backed by Gold and Silver.

188 2018-01-16 12:43:39 plastic money in this economy is generally an expensive way to purchase commodities. you are made to pay up to 50% more than the cash price. then there are sectors that strictly want cash vendors, macombi etc
189 2018-01-16 12:41:18 Rise in commodities do to global growth and/or USD weakness. Copper is used as collateral for bad loans. As more chinese companies (specially builders) default in 2018, this is going to have a great impact on #HG. This is only my view based on what I saw from first hand in 2014.
190 2018-01-16 12:26:57 Looking at all markets (stocks, fixed income, currencies, gold, commodities) across the globe, I think the message being loudly spoken is that markets believe that the inflation genie has been let out of the bottle.

251 2018-01-16 08:01:15 Cotton and Purdue sound like commodities from the deep and segregated South of a long distant time and place. 
These men lack a true and moral compass with their quibbling and parsing of words to defend the indefensible.
252 2018-01-16 08:00:01 These brokers should not be allowed to operate even in securities markets. They used their NBFCs to rotate black money in commodities markets.

256 2018-01-16 07:28:23 While labor is a market transactions there are inherent differences from other commodities. That is the nuance. Labor is an expense not an allocation of capital. You obviously never took an accounting course. And it is not mandated.

349 2018-01-16 00:10:53 De hecho, cercanos al equipo económico de Piñera han admitido que el alto crecimiento de su gobierno se debió principalmente al alto valor de las commodities. De eso también se benefició la izquierda bolivariana. Luego, el "erudito en economía" es otro.
350 2018-01-16 00:10:28 It has to be systematically impossible for one person to gain as much power over the government as, say, a Koch, a Soros, or a Walton has now.

It'd probably have to be a cashless society where there's no longer a distinction between commodities and valuables b/c of availability.
351 2018-01-16 00:07:15 As far as I know higher commodity prices have nothing to do with the demand for the USD.  That said, when the dollar strengthens against other major currencies, the prices of commodities generally tend to decrease and when the dollar weakens prices tend to increase.
