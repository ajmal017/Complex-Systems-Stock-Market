1 2019-01-03 23:59:41 Went ahead & positioned myself for Q1 #OTC  My trades were out of Stocks & into cash before the crash, so today I moved into about 10 New Cannabis/CBD/Pics&Shovel Positions. Good Day & Trade well

4 2019-01-03 23:56:50 I guess if you're like Chicago ald Ed Burke who had to surrender 23 guns Burke had in his office you can ban extended magazines and bump stocks as it has no personal impact.
5 2019-01-03 23:56:42 We are also paying out billions in lost economy and stocks, not to mention the money we are paying the farmers to plow under soybeans.

7 2019-01-03 23:56:23 The Dow fell 5.6%. The S&P 500 was down 6.2% and the Nasdaq fell 4%. It was the worst year for stocks since 2008.

11 2019-01-03 23:55:19 Huge cascade effect from this coming.   I am guessing there will be a day or week where strong individual stocks will be trading under book because of a feedback loop.
12 2019-01-03 23:55:11 Don't worry folks, the Japanese are back in tomorrow to save the day. They'll ramp up usdjpy, hit the bids on Treasuries and stocks will find a new spring in it's step.

14 2019-01-03 23:54:18 Apple's market cap dropped as much as the value of all the BTC in the world combined (in 24hrs).

Yet, the population still wants to own stocks trading at 100x earnings as if the company will exist 25 years from now and remain profitable? 

The future is crypto and blockchain

38 2019-01-03 23:51:39 That's very worrisome, I hope you will get your medicine spon one way or another. Some EU companies has already redirected their stocks to other countries to be guaranteed to sell without disruption, that may affect the UK market already now.
39 2019-01-03 23:51:36 To be fair, though, Republicans blocked ANYTHING Obama wanted to do after Sandy Hook. And they acted like banning bump stocks was the be-all end-all solution and gun violence is now solved forever, which is stupid.
40 2019-01-03 23:51:22 You got stocks to go back on?
41 2019-01-03 23:51:06 Bloodbath: Stocks Crater As Perfect Storm Of Apple And Recession Fear Strikes
42 2019-01-03 23:50:56 Should this come to fruition... hopefully they would allow one such as myself to be able to participate as I have longed to trade/invest in tech stocks but unable to due to not meeting "requirements"
43 2019-01-03 23:50:27 Stocks have been choppy all year. It has nothing to do with the mid terms since they started falling when Republicans had full control over all government.
44 2019-01-03 23:49:35 The recession cos Ive been saving up cash/liquidating parts of my portfolio to buy cheap stocks when it hits 
45 2019-01-03 23:49:04 Amazing guys! Something must change xxx
46 2019-01-03 23:48:32 A reason contributing to stocks trading below book in 70s-early 80s was accelerating inflation--it made balance sheets look "artificially good" and 40% of EPS growth during that period was "inventory holding gains"--hence, P/B discount.  Investor discounted inflation.
47 2019-01-03 23:48:02 YouTube played a commercial for me about investing in stocks. They’ve been wrong about my interests before, but this is a new level of wrong.
48 2019-01-03 23:47:40 1st day in office Stocks tank as Dems take over! @realDonaldTrump warned Americans it would happen, & correct again. Apple has been using slave labor in China, & its time they pay the price for assisting our enemies! Nike too! Google too! Patriotism is bigger than $$. @PressSec
49 2019-01-03 23:47:34 I buy a new gun every time I read a news story about her. It’s my right! FYI start buying gun stocks....
50 2019-01-03 23:46:49 Option writers hedge Futures and equity stocks . Put writers push up from bottom and call writers push down from Top along with cash and futures. It is Option buyers who buy Options when writers are keeping ready the sell offer in exchange always
51 2019-01-03 23:46:44 Apple stocks tanked... 
52 2019-01-03 23:46:12 My best guess for the near term is that I am the stupid money. In coming week/weeks My positions proceed to get assholed, and all of the bobble heads on Bloomberg and CNBC saying stocks are a bargain turn out looking like geniuses...

55 2019-01-03 23:45:22 @realDonaldTrump How come if America is "winning" so much 
1. Stocks are tanking
2. Deficit is ballooning
3. Trade war is still on
4. Government #TrumpShutdown
5. "Trickle Down" tax cut is a No Go
6. #Individual1 still not in jail
7. LIES are passed as facts???

#TrumpResign
56 2019-01-03 23:44:40 I am sure you misspelled that but nvm. Doesnt matter the population size no company that can get that much capital loaned to them can be called a start up and there is no way a start up can get that much cash even by stocks, even popular franchises would have trouble
57 2019-01-03 23:44:30 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
58 2019-01-03 23:43:13 I find it very interesting that Tim Cook from Apple is blaming the trade  problems with China for the drop in their stocks.  Maybe if they made their phones affordable instead of over $1000, people would buy more IPhones!
59 2019-01-03 23:43:05 I think that banks were part of the old economy stocks that were discarded in late 90's
60 2019-01-03 23:43:00 @lc_stocks
61 2019-01-03 23:42:38 the day Democrats take over The House, stocks crash, coincidence...nope
62 2019-01-03 23:42:36 Apple lost stocks! N everything just keeps going down
63 2019-01-03 23:42:25 yet more fluffy words
64 2019-01-03 23:42:22 We should go full speed. Politicans dont give a  rap about your highway safety. They want stocks, money, taxes. To hell with stoned drivers, damaged young brains. We like revenue. Just like cigs kill, wait for long term fails.
65 2019-01-03 23:41:43 It's normally not a common thing but it is now for much of the stocks out there! There aren't many buyers and a lot of the big boys got out already and the public are left holding the bag trying to get out but there needs to be buyers.
66 2019-01-03 23:41:07 Omg stop
67 2019-01-03 23:40:21 It is possible and I will prove it by October this year.. possibly sooner lol he won’t feel the effects right away but his stocks will drop fast.. I may be a nobody but I am a brilliant nobody..
68 2019-01-03 23:39:19 you ll be better trading stocks at that play bud
69 2019-01-03 23:38:36 There hasn't been a lot of capitalism since 2008. but stocks did go up quite a bit.
70 2019-01-03 23:38:17 guess us millennials have trump to thank for the upcoming historic opportunity to buy stocks..... if you think this capitalism thing is going to make it long-term #tradewar #tariffs
71 2019-01-03 23:37:51 The average flow of these stocks were horrible this year... was moving around and still didn’t really gain much... 
72 2019-01-03 23:37:28 Only stocks.
73 2019-01-03 23:37:16 I've done nothing but lose money in stocks for months
74 2019-01-03 23:37:00 Why have stocks dropped? It’s not because of Dems, it’s because PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHEN THEY WILL GWT BACK TO WORK. No money no spending. @realDonaldTrump can place the. Lame on Dems all he wants however it’s all his fault. And if trump supporters don’t understand than (1)
75 2019-01-03 23:35:57 When #aapl will repurchase its own stocks? They can buy it cheaper now than before
76 2019-01-03 23:35:19 Cash yields are higher than dividend yields for 60% of company stocks in the S&P 500.
77 2019-01-03 23:35:15 Possibly profit taking on uranium stocks this time... selling losers to offset the gains.
78 2019-01-03 23:34:57 You could tell they had buy programs all day, but selling pressure was too much.  More and more workers will start to move their 401k investments to bonds by selling shares common stocks, which executes at end of day. I anticipate end of day selling to be the common theme for now
79 2019-01-03 23:34:37 Indeed  I have stocks chilling now 
80 2019-01-03 23:34:30 I’ve come to the conclusion I really am bad luck. I literally began investing in stocks right when it started going down like Kesha. Sorry everyone
81 2019-01-03 23:34:18 66 of the 68 tech stocks in the s&p 500 are down this year.

the exceptions are DXC, an IT services company, and Alliance Data Systems, a provider of loyalty and marketing services.

combined market cap: $23 bln
82 2019-01-03 23:34:14 Not sure why he decided at 88 yrs old that he should start buying tech stocks
83 2019-01-03 23:34:14 Apple stocks lost $74b in value today>? #haha never thought much of apple products in the first place tho #money
84 2019-01-03 23:33:26 Stocks are on sale!!   As I say to my lovely wife.
85 2019-01-03 23:32:46 Is it common for low price, low volume stocks to have big moves like today?
86 2019-01-03 23:32:33 I am long...I have money in some stocks I have had for over 15 years..like Apple..I had Celgene and Bristol Meyers bought themntoday
87 2019-01-03 23:32:04 Therefore as your picks are no where near “herd stocks” I predict you will not win any monthly awards bug have a good chance in the annual comp. my picks this year much less speculative bar one. I’ll probably still finish in the bottom 20 
88 2019-01-03 23:31:57 try 3 and a quarter off stocks in a week.. We upp brudah nd imeandat
89 2019-01-03 23:31:43 In the long-run stocks go up only for three reasons. 

1. Earnings 2. Earnings 3. Earnings

91 2019-01-03 23:30:12 Sources of happiness cannot be from one place.

If everything comes from one person or thing, you must create room from other places. 

Like stocks, you diversify. Ups & downs can become steady gains with multiple sources, rather than extreme swings sticking to just one.
92 2019-01-03 23:30:06 Stocks are the best long term growth vehicle, and sooner or later they’ll be back in favor. Stay tuned in and active or miss the boat.
93 2019-01-03 23:30:02 Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. forex stocks
94 2019-01-03 23:29:32 Stocks were "glitching" again today. What's up with that?
95 2019-01-03 23:29:19 In a bear market they take them all down... The only survivors now are the gold stocks and a few special situation plays.
96 2019-01-03 23:29:14 Apple lost over $300 billions in market value. Investors, 401k holders shared the loss from Apple and many other US stocks. Sad!
97 2019-01-03 23:28:47 Don;t you think it is embarrassing for him to be invited again and again when he has consistently been wrong on stocks to cryptos? Or are you inviting him to grill on his wrong predictions? 

Give him & BK off for rest of year.

99 2019-01-03 23:26:24 WSJ[U.S. stocks tumbled Thursday, as weak economic data and a rare sales warning from Apple sparked fresh worries among investors about a global slowdown. manufacturing data around the world have pointed to slowing momentum.]
100 2019-01-03 23:25:50 These stocks are a joke! It's just a way to constantly bow down to other countries and give them what they want! Maybe they should start paying their own way and cooperating with America!
101 2019-01-03 23:25:18 I’ve forgotten who now but someone did once provide some stats proving that pump and dump POS stocks usually win the monthly calls on buying spikes but rarely the annual comp. “herd” stocks also usually perform badly
102 2019-01-03 23:24:35 Unfortunately you were taken in by the ramp crew that operate on Twitter lse and advfn.
They make you believe it's the best thing since slice bread.

There are other stocks that you can easily make back the 15k that you are down.

Trust nobody!
103 2019-01-03 23:24:18 Listening to this UWS dad explain to his 7yo son how stocks and such works is excruciating. 

But also very informative, thank you, Scott.
104 2019-01-03 23:24:11 Wall Street knows when dems in stocks drop  hope you heard the lesson President Trump and border patrol says, “Walls Work”
105 2019-01-03 23:23:33 What’s wrong with our financial leaders? Why should we base our Mkt on China’s economy. It’s been closed to most US exports. We need to invest & trust in US tech & mfg. Did China panic when they stole our jobs & GDP?  Full steam ahead MAGA.  Time to buy US Stocks @POTUS @cvpayne
106 2019-01-03 23:22:51 Everyday that $STMP $HIIQ are up in the morning, they’re down by close. People, these are garbage stocks. Save your money.

109 2019-01-03 23:22:15 Hey @Apple seen your stocks drop the last few months, maybe if you’d stop making expensive ass phones that NO ONE can afford and make cheaper options then your stocks and market would go back up. $1k phones is just INSANE. You can buy a car with that money. Stupid asses.
110 2019-01-03 23:21:41 These Apple stocks got to chill b 
111 2019-01-03 23:21:32 Oil company stocks falling like a rock.
112 2019-01-03 23:21:03 Think about traditional logic. Buy stocks young then bonds/CDs at an old age. More baby boomers retiring every day who are done with the wild market swings needing stability and 4% returns to keep them fed. We aren't there yet...
113 2019-01-03 23:20:44 I was in store today it's always medium busy..let's call that main Street ..ie no none cares..stocks owners ..another world

115 2019-01-03 23:20:30 Que les stocks soient écoulés, on est en démocratie libérale bordel de merde!
116 2019-01-03 23:20:11 We talk about buying stocks a lot, but when should you sell?
Let your winners run, but if the business fundamentals change, you lose faith in management, or your thesis isn't taking hold, it might be time to cut bait.
117 2019-01-03 23:20:01 Him spending a few days in the stocks wouldn't go amiss, imho.
118 2019-01-03 23:19:12 No Dow Stocks have RSI > 50 $WMT is highest at 49.96. $AAPL is lowest at 27.90
119 2019-01-03 23:16:59 Apple stocks down 9.96% cause of huge revenue loss, now looks a good time to invest I should think, turn a profit when they get they shit back together
120 2019-01-03 23:16:38 Wasting Time & MONEY! That's why stocks fall when Dem take something over. Shouldn't he be working on Bills & Reopening Government
121 2019-01-03 23:16:30 Oh the irony.  Trump banned bump stocks.  So of course the criminals will turn in their bump stocks.  gotcha.  Hilarious.
122 2019-01-03 23:16:14 lol found a Robin on Elite smash named red thats playing 2 stocks with low timer and he won by timeout. I'm sure he's not just getting blocked by absolutely everyone that plays him :p
123 2019-01-03 23:14:57 Stocks are down again. So when are you going to resign trump?
124 2019-01-03 23:14:56 Researching stocks no one else is and buying first mainly small cap micro cap. Setting targets, not rushing to sell. FPFTP Five part five trades portfolio. Progressive dividend balanced with income/growth.
125 2019-01-03 23:14:18 Stocks go up praise the pres...
Stocks go down derrrrr desecrates did it... 

Pathetic get some logical arguments
126 2019-01-03 23:14:11 I think Hammy is sick, good thing @ruchie74 stocks up on fish meds like the world is going to end and he single handedly will be able to cure fish for the rest of time
127 2019-01-03 23:13:35 The huge drops in bank stocks we've seen since early-mid 2018 are clearly indicative that something is wrong systemically. And the big drops in other equities recently tells me that some of these institutions are having to dump their positions quickly.
128 2019-01-03 23:13:32 when a ur teammate dies in smash and the remaining team tries to knock down ur stocks but they don’t know the power of Roy
129 2019-01-03 23:13:19 No one is dying because of a gov shut down but nice straw man. We mostly pay for wasted government through inflation, which hurts the poor the most I’m sure you would agree. Rich people own stocks which are inflation proof but wages aren’t.

132 2019-01-03 23:11:48 I love the Jai Alai, it’s unique like Heineken. Responding here because I once paid obscene price like $15 for one 16 oz can for similar, and I found it not so much better.  Of course that may have been because I was already a bit lit, just looking for opinion, beers not stocks.
133 2019-01-03 23:11:00 What are top 3 stocks to check right now?
134 2019-01-03 23:10:58 With the economy slowing (GDP, housing, stocks) trump will be more likely to fold on the border wall imo
135 2019-01-03 23:10:54 I am either in Uranium or Cash for the most part right now. Would love to see uranium stocks break free but treading water is ok by me in this backdrop.
136 2019-01-03 23:10:42 @stocks
137 2019-01-03 23:09:55 Once it's done we have an inflationary slow-down phase. It's a nowhere to hide unless you are a day trader. Sitting in cash is needed (2018). Once it's done (mostly topping pattern) we enter deflationary phase. Yields going down, but stocks are getting hammered (2019+)

139 2019-01-03 23:08:22 Crop yield variability increases will make us hit a multi-year cluster of bad harvests, which will deplete global carryover stocks, which will lead to food price spikes and a die-off in food import-dependent poor countries
140 2019-01-03 23:08:19 Technology stocks dropped 5%. @Apple dropping 10%, other popular tech stocks @amazon @facebook and @Google parent Alphabet fell 2.5%
141 2019-01-03 23:08:07 There are 4 market cycles. The longest one is deflationary recovery. This is a moment when stocks raising in line with bonds (yield drop) (2009-2016), once it reached we have inflationary phase - stocks up, bonds down (2016-2018). This phase loves commodities, oil and EEM.

149 2019-01-03 23:06:30 Gurufocus if you need global equities - I am positively surprised by Gurufocus - it has many great tools and interactive charting is also good. Plus it has an awesome old school one pager look Manual of Stocks. Valueline style. Koyfin is also good

153 2019-01-03 23:05:55 I was thinking their tax rates would be based on the disparity between how much the highest paid employee is paid(+benefits, stocks) vs the lowest paid employee.  The smaller the gap, the lower the tax rate.
154 2019-01-03 23:05:49 Just bought a few stocks actually. They are looking swaggy lately
155 2019-01-03 23:05:33 Naw, but for real in between games I come up with 2 things that I did well and I need to keep doing, and 2 things I need to fix.

I do an abbreviated version between stocks. Otherwise, I try to do a wonky mixup to try to change my flow.

163 2019-01-03 23:03:59 #lagavulin is soooooo tasty! My local bar stocks it just for me!
164 2019-01-03 23:02:35 That’s one plan. The opposite scenario could also play out where stocks start a strong comeback and bonds, metals/miners sell off again, like they’ve done many times before. But that’s an easy one... the 200d will get me out.
165 2019-01-03 23:02:33 Yeah, I’ve been using tradestation but their fees are too high for the really low priced stocks.
166 2019-01-03 23:02:22 I'll be joining my colleague, Brian Williams, at 11:15pm EST tonight (1/3) on "The 11th Hour" to talk about how one bad Apple spoiled a whole bunch of stocks today, and other factors affecting the market and economy and, possibly, the President. Please tune in!

170 2019-01-03 23:00:46 Morphes restocks are way too small, it makes for a perfect opportunity to buy it and sell it for a higher price. The fans want it so bad, some of them will buy it from these people. And fu morphe. You know how reguested it is, but you stock in small stocks to keep up the hype. 
171 2019-01-03 23:00:42 Yeah your right. I better pay somebody to manage my money and net 1% MAYBE, in this  bear market. My account is up 500% since November 11  when I opened it. I’ll take 500% over 1%. You are the guy who buys high dividend stocks and takes no risks. Good luck.
172 2019-01-03 23:00:42 That’s the one thing that truly pisses me off about him. The accountability. I root for DT as much as I can because I root for our Country, but you hear crickets when accountability is needed I.e. today with stocks but when things going well, he’s first to pound his chest/boast.
173 2019-01-03 23:00:25 Why do people own bump stocks? Because it's their right.
174 2019-01-03 23:00:20 If the stock market is solely reliant on one stock we should delist that stock. Or maybe they can begin making in the US. But if you think 500 is a big dip and you play stocks on one day results, you may want to stop trading stocks now, because it is not for you.
175 2019-01-03 23:00:11 Supposedly shaving 90 points off Dow. But even after trading on FB shut down,DOW kept plunging. Is Zuck going to buy back stocks & drive the price back up for no valid reason.

178 2019-01-03 22:58:20 I really hope it is a real bill that would be as effective as the one Warren proposed.

184 2019-01-03 22:53:28 Nancy (Nazi) Pelosi takes the gavel in the House and Markets drop almost 3% in one day.  Of course, the democrats were probably shorting the stocks.  That how they get so rich, betting against this Country and making laws that make hurts us.  And don't forget child trafficking.
185 2019-01-03 22:53:27 When the crap hit the fan in 2000, US stocks got creamed.  US looks much worse as do many other large markets Europe and China.  We could be looking at a "trumped up" impeachment later this year.  It will fail, but won't provide a lot of confidence in the US and its rule of law.

188 2019-01-03 22:51:57 In justice's? Are you stupid. Lower taxes lower unemployment stocks high and you lie about growth? I remember the Obama administration which was trash. Dam Democrats lie all the way to the bank.

190 2019-01-03 22:51:47 @militarywife_69 I know you’re a gun enthusiast. What do you think about trumps recent ban on bump stocks?
191 2019-01-03 22:51:38 Most lawyers would prefer to consolidate and settle these types of cases before they go to trials. Short sellers want stocks of companies to go to zero for a stock gain. Their thesis is not for whistleblower settlements or growth of companies. Maybe you should consider a limit L.

199 2019-01-03 22:47:36 If you truly understand the market, then you would know that ‘Trump’ had nothing to do with recent sharp drops in the market. That’s opinion/emotional thinking  Think China, tech stocks, and high interest rates.

210 2019-01-03 22:44:43 I already plan on investing in green businesses that are not lucrative enough to be like a 401K stock portfolio but will still make better gains than paying more on a mortgage for a family size home. I just want a condo. I refuse to invest in stocks for evil companies.

223 2019-01-03 22:40:20 I tell you, obviously you are well aware but it's tough finding correlations with financials and share prices. Some stocks for whatever reason don't move much to downside for decades even with muted growth metrics.

226 2019-01-03 22:39:44 Good on her. He was a great POTUS with experience in the job. Trump is a asshole giving tax cuts to his mates and ruining the economy. Stocks crash. Trillions on extra debt. Sick of winning?

Never fails to work.
50/50 stocks to cash.
trade futures and sell calls on pops in stocks then buy back cheaper while collecting dividends.
rinse & repeat till your Heart is content.
230 2019-01-03 22:37:59 Umm @CNBC saying "airlines crashing today" may not be the best way to talk about their stocks

255 2019-01-03 22:30:21 Bump stocks aren't the problem.  The problem is that criminals will always find ways to kill people.  If it's not guns, they'll use knives or bombs.  The solution is for people to be well armed, and that means bump stocks if they want  them.

258 2019-01-03 22:29:32 I cautiously agree with the idea that meat eating will become less common, but I suspect it’ll be due to increased cost of meat. Reduction in grazing land and dwindling fish stocks will make meat the preserve of the wealthy.

266 2019-01-03 22:23:30 Apple among world's most widely held stocks,fell 10% in its darkest day in 6 years. The former king of the stock market fell to the 4th-biggest public company,behind Amazon,Microsoft & Alphabet (Google).

273 2019-01-03 22:21:05 Alex, what's your thoughts on DX Exchange digitizing the popular tech stocks..?  A breakdown video is in need for the community.
274 2019-01-03 22:20:57 READ THE LAST LINE OF WHAT YOU ASKED US TO READ THEN COME BACK TO ME. WORTHLESS STOCKS THAT IN REALITY THE GOVERNMENT ISNT ALLOWED TO OWN.
275 2019-01-03 22:20:54 So when stocks dropped 724 the time Trump imposed an executive order mandating tariffs, that was because of incumbent Dems?

277 2019-01-03 22:20:44 I be having dreams of my stocks exploding and me becoming rich but it's also a dream
278 2019-01-03 22:20:21 Let me know about the stocks still wondering about them for my bear runs
279 2019-01-03 22:20:13 Zuck wanted FB to issue him a third class of shares where if he sold off all his liquid FB stocks, he would still be in full control of the company. This is a sign of a founder CEO not believing that his company will generate value long term.
280 2019-01-03 22:19:19 ....stocks makes them illegal. 

I agree on some drugs. Weed, maybe coke. But you can’t legalize heroine, fentanyl etc. what you going to do, let a 21 year old go to the store and buy something that will turn them into a junky in one hit????
281 2019-01-03 22:19:09 Aye @NipseyHussle I Got This @WholeFoods @amazon Amazon Prime Stocks Investment  Let’s Build Hussle & Motivate 
282 2019-01-03 22:19:05 Sold my two stocks this morning $CYBR $AVGO, no gain no loss. Gave it a shot, but there’s still too much selling pressure to be long individual names as the major indices MIGHT want to test Xmas eve lows, or worse.
283 2019-01-03 22:18:56 #stocks in this type of Mkt , charts r pretty much worthless. They’re backward looking not forward. To many macro events right now causing chaos
284 2019-01-03 22:18:47 U.S. stocks close far lower,on Thursday 01/03/19 $DJIA -2.83% at 22,686.22, $SPX -2.48% at 2,477.89, $COMPQ -3.04% at 6,463.50, $RUT -1.31% at $1330.83.
285 2019-01-03 22:18:37 $APPL stocks lost more than $75 billion in total today. This is a more than the total market cap of #bitcoin! Crypto is still tiny....
286 2019-01-03 22:18:23 Pretty mutch like you Quakes 80% URANIUM,  10% GOLD and 10% CUPPER/NICKEL stocks
287 2019-01-03 22:18:18 The big difference is the money in the Silicon Valley. That’s why the events will come here. The tech stocks(even with the hit today) are worth too much.
288 2019-01-03 22:18:16 Stocks in ‘The Graph’ just shot up. Invest now.
289 2019-01-03 22:18:01 Friday Video tomorrow ....

#stocks #options #PENNYSTOCKS
290 2019-01-03 22:17:52 If you get rid of the guns, and leave enough time for it to be effective to remove them from the country which might be 100+ years, there won’t be any illegal guns to use. And I think every gun he had was actually purchased legally, including the bump stocks. Now using bump....
291 2019-01-03 22:17:45 Trump has ruined the country; the world is laughing at us w/no respect (google will show you), hate crimes are at steep rise, stocks had worst year in decades, making taxpayers contribute to a wall that could be used to put “ America First “. He’s a piece of shit lol
292 2019-01-03 22:17:38 Love Chili especially homemade. I have to watch her shake the Cayenne Pepper closely. I like Chili  like my Stocks, 
HOT!!! 
293 2019-01-03 22:16:51 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your bipolar disorder
294 2019-01-03 22:16:10 the stock market is so lit that bought 6 stocks the past week, dont know if that was stupid or genius
295 2019-01-03 22:16:08 #stocks ok who feels better that we’re not in a bear market but just having a ‘Glitch’? I know I feel so much better (sarcasm)
296 2019-01-03 22:16:03 Nothing about you has been historic, stocks are plunging, economy is going to crash if you stay in office.  You are keeping American workers hostage for a stupid wall, one  you will never get. You don't care if people cab pay their bills or not. You have to go!
297 2019-01-03 22:15:45 North Dakota derives 27% of their electrical use from wind power.... and they’ve always had a Republican state government. How and why?...because they have a free energy market and somebody is making money from it.
298 2019-01-03 22:15:44 @AppleiPhonesLA maybe if you did not charge 1,000$ for a phone people could afford to upgrade every year and then the stocks wouldn’t plunge  just food for thought
299 2019-01-03 22:15:28 I bought in on some stocks today I’m eager to see how this turn out 
300 2019-01-03 22:14:59 @dirk_nannes ABC stocks very low when they hire a t 20 ex player to do comments who couldnt possibly know what it takes or what tactics are required like hiring a putt putt champion to comment on the PGA in case you missed it indian players dont handle the short ball well champ
301 2019-01-03 22:14:28 Good point, “What to do?” I have good stocks and after thoroughly checking for reasons, there were none, except, the overall market falling and being the year end, tax loss sales, that I use to make money. Yes, the taxpayer pays me for losing money, then I repurchase in 30 days.
302 2019-01-03 22:14:18 Warren Buffett spent just over $1 Billion to buy 9.8 million shares of Apple in Q1 2016. Today that stake is worth ~$1.4 Billion.

If he had taken the money and bought Bitcoin instead, he would have $8.7 billion.

Maybe Mr. Buffett should start buying some rat poison! lol

303 2019-01-03 22:14:16 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks tumble as Apple revises lower guidance and economic slowdown concerns.
304 2019-01-03 22:14:03 For NEW or BEGINNERS, you all need to learn and master the pattern charts(pinned) and how to draw resistance and support levels with all time frames.  

These skills are the basic to start trading stocks/options.

Study like CRAZY!! You will see a whole new world!!! :)
305 2019-01-03 22:12:48 As a provincial Liberal in Saskatchewan, I propose building two 4th Gen nuclear power generation plants... they are close to being certified, safer and can be built at a reasonable cost... we have uranium.
306 2019-01-03 22:12:48 33 day crossover in EM internet security stocks is risk on for activist managers confirms Carney.
307 2019-01-03 22:12:24 Stocks started dropping in October. Please explain how it’s the dems fault. Bc they exist. Do some research before you regurgitate what you hear on TV
308 2019-01-03 22:12:16 Apple Inc. market value: USD 674,75 billion.

309 2019-01-03 22:10:00 The $500 challenge...? Are you doing it with penny stocks or Option. Since you are saying you are watching SBUX and NKE and COST. Probably option.
310 2019-01-03 22:09:49 Consider what the Liberal government did to extend UI benefits to unemployed Albertans. They bought a pipeline and yet you still complain and condemn them... there is no pleasing some people.
311 2019-01-03 22:09:46 #stocks  Current trade/tariff standoff with China is crisis Donald Trump created. It’s a crisis that he might not be able to solve because he doesn’t understand tariffs mean higher prices for American business and consumers.  It all means loses.  Heavy loses.
312 2019-01-03 22:09:35 Start investing in crypto. People don’t get it but you are in control of your money. You can take it out whenever you want it’s a worldwide 24-7 market which has never been seen before. Stocks are horrible cause you have no control of your money & no say in what the company does.
313 2019-01-03 22:09:33 I am a member of your action alert and have sent u two emails with questions ..no response. I saw u on the Today Show on Tuesday telling viewers to not be in the market. U have been recommending buying stocks to your club... which is it?
314 2019-01-03 22:08:42 What are your thoughts on fund managers that are managing peoples stocks without stop losses and continue to hold through bad periods as they like the fundamentals and also get paid by the % of clients portfolios?
315 2019-01-03 22:08:36 Haha. Yup or what about there precious dividends. Can't sell my stocks because they pay me dividends. Umm a 2.5% annual dividend doesn't equal a 30% loss of capital but they don't get that either.
316 2019-01-03 22:08:32 Almost all stocks are doing bad today
317 2019-01-03 22:08:25 U.S. stocks plunged on Thursday and 2-year U.S. Treasury yields dropped below the Federal Reserve's policy rate for the first time in more than a decade, delivering a signal the U.S. central bank could begin reversing its tightening regime before ...
318 2019-01-03 22:08:25 Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Thursday:
319 2019-01-03 22:08:24 Stocks went into a steep slide Thursday after Apple sent a shudder through Wall Street with word that iPhone sales in China are falling, reinforcing fears that the global economy is weakening.
320 2019-01-03 22:06:59 Y todavía más lamentable aún que lleven dos semanas sin stocks de chandals, sudaderas y prácticamente de nada en las tiendas oficiales. En plena Navidad.
321 2019-01-03 22:06:33 The worst Quickplay players are the ones where the first match is fine but then the rematch is some shit like 4 minute 2 stocks
322 2019-01-03 22:06:10 10-year yield at 2.55% which fundamentally makes stocks cheaper. Meaning some stocks might be at a very good price. Watch for another rally soon.
323 2019-01-03 22:05:00 Apple stocks down 10% today.

Shoulda built your s**t in the US.
324 2019-01-03 22:04:01 The US Treasury Dept says the national debt has increased by 2 Trillion since Trump took office w/ complete Republican control, stocks are diving & the government is shutdown bc Trump lied & wants US to pay for a useless $25 billion wall.

Conclusion: Trump is fucking WORTHLESS.
325 2019-01-03 22:03:49 $AAPL move likely related to a boycott element based on arrest of Chinese competitor CFO. This is not usually covered by our media. That said, Apple is a product of the 1% so one of the best stocks on way up and will be one of worst on way down.
326 2019-01-03 22:03:49 Tell the Presidick to keep it shut Tell 2020He Has Fuk Trade Up Stocks has lost all 2017/18 Gains 
327 2019-01-03 22:03:34 Could be SWF rebalancing. I know some of the big ones have policy portfolios that track 60/40 esque benchmarks. Could be purchasing treasuries with a lag due to past run up in stocks (could know it was this if flows reverse in Q4 data).
328 2019-01-03 22:02:50 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2019-01-03, is 311.19. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space

332 2019-01-03 22:01:52 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2019-01-03, is 300.36. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk
333 2019-01-03 22:01:32 Hahah, took two stocks from a Corrin by Resting. I love Jigglypuff so much lmao
334 2019-01-03 22:01:27 It’s moves like that where we are sucked back into the FOMO stage unfortunately. The broad market in general was a shxt show today, yet pot stocks were pretty stable for the most part. So it’s making it even tougher with how strong or weak the correlations are to SPY these days.
335 2019-01-03 22:00:35 Oh, cool! 1-v-1 me, bruh! Two stocks! No items! Final Destination only! :D

337 2019-01-03 21:59:34 @tim_cook hey Tim cook. I want my money back. You released guidance early and destroyed all my tech stocks and my swks and aapl position. I want my money back now.
338 2019-01-03 21:59:09 I think I made it very clear in my book and I stand by what I said... No, it's not really any different this time. Stocks rise and fall for the same reasons, and regardless of what events unfold, the market will discount them and the law of supply/demand will have the final say.
339 2019-01-03 21:58:39 Will never happen. Reserve currency has to open its market for investors to buy stocks and bonds to reserve purchasing power. It’s 0.8% in China. Ridiculous low. Plus China has to open its account books for inspection by investors, it won’t do that either.
340 2019-01-03 21:57:44 I think they do care about credit markets. They better. Powell not so much about stocks. Look at the OI in futures credit markets vs. stocks. That should tell you which the Fed should care about.
341 2019-01-03 21:56:44 U.S. stocks plunged on Thursday and 2-year U.S. Treasury yields dropped below the Federal Reserve's policy rate for the first time in more than a decade, delivering a signal the U.S. central bank could begin reversing its tightening regime before ...

344 2019-01-03 21:56:42 Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Thursday:
345 2019-01-03 21:56:30 No one is about to leave people alone to destroy the planet... that much is certain.
346 2019-01-03 21:56:01 Me to i even brought this book called stocks for dummies but uh still don’t get it lol
347 2019-01-03 21:55:42 Ok so no buying at the end of the day... sucks. #stocks #investing
348 2019-01-03 21:55:09 SPY Facts:  Only 15/500 stocks are above 50-Day Moving Average.  This is one sick and pathetic market.
349 2019-01-03 21:54:57 SELL YOUR STOCKS
350 2019-01-03 21:54:20 Reasonable approach. To be honest, I fully expect him to retreat from his hawkish stance a bit tomorrow, though. And it wouldnt surprise me to see USD selloff from it and stocks skyrocket for an hour or so.
351 2019-01-03 21:54:13 The Dow and Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index finished down 2.8% and 2.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index declined 3%

Stocks steered lower after a disappointing manufacturing report from the Institute for Supply Management — with the largest one-month drop since 2008.

353 2019-01-03 21:53:42 I want to learn about stocks.
354 2019-01-03 21:53:26 1st 3 qtrs of 2018? really? did he fail to remember Jan/Feb 2018? lol. 2 decent qtrs, maybe. most individual stocks started dec,ones in Jan and May. this guy is old
355 2019-01-03 21:52:43 Yup. If you’re in the large cap US stocks game, you should not be paying more than 1/10 OF 1% in expenses— NOT 1%, let alone 2-3%.
356 2019-01-03 21:52:27 9| Uhhhh This Crisis Coming Up Or Resession Let’s Say They’ll Try & Find Some More Ways To Help the Cronies. Though the Lady Said They Did Use Every Tool In the Book To Help Save All These Stocks & Bonds & Bank Note !! So they Might Be Out Of Tools But I Dought It.
357 2019-01-03 21:52:25 AS THE STOCKS PLUNGE DOWNWARD OVER CHINA TRADE WAR ; GOVT. SHUTDOWN ; DRUG CO. TAKE OVER & APPLE COMPUTER EARNINGS !
358 2019-01-03 21:52:02 Pour info, effectivement y a de nombreux bundle a des prix de fou mais c'est à 99% des prix cassés uniquement dispo en magasins locaux / régionaux (pour écouler les stocks) du coup chez les revendeurs plus classiques je suis moins sûrs
359 2019-01-03 21:51:36 Democrats are still blaming Trump for their own fuckups.

It is pretty damned obvious, from a brief glimpse of the stock market index, that stocks started to plunge the very moment it became apparent that enough Democrats would be elected to become a majority in the House.

(1/2)
360 2019-01-03 21:51:08 A few thoughts 1) What is the average percentage decline of stocks that fit a parabolic curve 2) How many of those that declined that average percent made over $10B+ a quarter
361 2019-01-03 21:50:54 Big day tomorrow with NonFarm Payrolls and @federalreserve Powell speech on tap. I expect markets to focus more on the latter - will the #Fed bolster #stocks with a dovish tone after faltering economic data? Or will that signal a looming recession and further tarnish sentiment?
362 2019-01-03 21:50:10 people who play 2 stocks be like

sorry! i dont watch rick and morty.
363 2019-01-03 21:49:51 There are a few securities that has no opinion on many of the best stocks in the market. A technologist with a keen sense of economics would be accurate in predicting a technology or industrials stocks than someone with a background in literature/CPA trained as Financial Advisor.
364 2019-01-03 21:49:48 To the idiots,
The stock market has a cycle around 10 yrs.  During that bullish period, many stocks are overvalued, and its ratio P/E is too high to make sense; therefore, many big investors use any rumors to sell off their stocks to gain profits, and the new cycle begins!
365 2019-01-03 21:49:03 Stocks Plunge on Apple's warning of a slowdown in China coupled with new negative data on manufacturing activity in the U.S. Dow Jones ends the day at 22,686.22 down 660.02 points or 2.83%. The S&P 500 ends at 2,447.89 down 62.14 points or 2.48%.
366 2019-01-03 21:48:50 Some of the Royalty Range is still available at a DISCOUNT  

Hurry while stocks last  Everything else is SOLD OUT ALREADY 
367 2019-01-03 21:48:21 Stocks are down because the Dems are taking over
368 2019-01-03 21:48:05 There are very few decent and honest posters on Hotcrapper with 5k plus posts. Be weary of the ones that never get it wrong and come and go like magic from P and D stocks.
369 2019-01-03 21:47:21 Warren Buffet learned the same lesson with stocks when he was 12. Can’t blame him for being stuck in his ways at this point.
370 2019-01-03 21:46:34 Stocks went into a steep slide Thursday after Apple sent a shudder through Wall Street with word that iPhone sales in China are falling, reinforcing fears that the global economy is weakening.
371 2019-01-03 21:46:31 How about doing your job and stop this damn ban on bump stocks and recapture our Second Amendment shall not be infringed! You took our money you took our faith don't crap on us anymore!
372 2019-01-03 21:46:29 Stocks went into a steep slide Thursday after Apple sent a shudder through Wall Street with word that iPhone sales in China are falling, reinforcing fears that the global economy is weakening.
373 2019-01-03 21:46:24 short 46.80... china and US seem far apart.. Trump and dems far apart. Stocks at lows. think overnight will be rough. but we will rally later tomorrow.
374 2019-01-03 21:46:16 Mr. Market negative view on $CELG partnered stocks tells me JPMorgan Conference won't help biotech either; Mr. Market creating all reasons not to own biotech right now, no matter what. Sad.

376 2019-01-03 21:45:19 The #stockmarket was down 660 points today because #Apple cut guidance??? Because iPhone sales are slow in China the whole U.S. economy is in jeopardy? Give me a f’n break! Maybe #NYSE employees are just churning as usual! I call bull***t! #fakenews #stocks @FoxBusiness @NYSE
377 2019-01-03 21:44:42 .@realDonaldTrump WOW!Another day of destroying the economy! Stocks got slammed on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing down 2.83%, or 662 points. The S&P 500 fell 2.48%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.04%. Great job #TariffMan #TrumpShutdown #TrumpResign
378 2019-01-03 21:44:28 UNITED FELLOWSHIP stocks slump
379 2019-01-03 21:44:28 First five stocks I bought all went to the wall. Then I stopped buying 'stories' and bought my first decent company. I still own shares in it 26 years later and it's paid enough dividends and risen enough that I couldn't even tell you the share price today as it doesn't matter.
380 2019-01-03 21:44:07 @realDonaldTrump @VP @senatemajldr @FoxNews @SenateGOP @GOP @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle   Donald is losing it .... must get the Treasury to start buying stocks!!! Get those numbers up!!

382 2019-01-03 21:44:02 @ananavarro and with that question I really want to know what do they want that 5 billion dollars for is it that some of his rich friends have stocks into the stuff you need to make this big imaginary wall
383 2019-01-03 21:44:01 UCTS works just as well with stocks too?
384 2019-01-03 21:43:59 For a guy that doesn’t like OTC stocks you sure are up on $MDXG. 99% of the 7x7s were returned but because reps weren’t paid until the VA paid AvKare they never showed up on sales reports.
385 2019-01-03 21:43:41 It happened.

Disclaimer: we did 2 stocks to 3. I killed myself as well too. Lmao.
386 2019-01-03 21:42:56 Yeah, as they buy up stocks at rock bottom prices.
387 2019-01-03 21:42:50 Stocks down 600 points today same day Dems take control on the House.
388 2019-01-03 21:42:05 just a friendly reminder that these stocks plummetting have very little to do with anything other than the tariff wars going on with China. which is directly correlated to our Commander-in-Chief... #stayfocused
389 2019-01-03 21:41:46 Seriously!!?? We’re going backwards instead of moving forward?  Who owns stocks in these meds?  Is there another reason they’re pushing these ineffective drugs on CPP’s?
390 2019-01-03 21:41:41 @realDonaldTrump, our economy is great? Stocks are tanking because of your tariffs; my retirement seems to be disappearing. And you want my tax money to go to your wall? I’ll stop paying my taxes. Maybe we’ll meet in prison. Cc: @TeamPelosi

394 2019-01-03 21:40:13 Stocks skyrocketed as soon as Trump was elected President and they have been tumbling as soon as it was known Pelosi was going to take over the house.

396 2019-01-03 21:40:02 Just look at tech stocks today after the Apple announcement.  Remember, trade wars are good and easy to win.

398 2019-01-03 21:39:42 FAANG stocks have not made sense for a long long time either. But people (smart people) have been buying them hand over fist for years.

similar drops on inflated stocks are called corrections, and this is def a correction if taken in context, not politicised.

408 2019-01-03 21:37:24 You should not be playing stocks all in; after 2017 you could have re-balanced and diversified and would probably broke even on 2018.

413 2019-01-03 21:36:33 Apple says the sales for a damn iPhone are going to be off due to slower sales than expected in China and tech stocks fall 5 percent. This is how we know Apple has to much power.

419 2019-01-03 21:33:48 Mutual stock index funds. Why put your money in a savings or checkings account for years when you can invest it and get more of a return? Plus it’s all automated so you don’t manage the stocks. The more $ you make the more you can put away too
420 2019-01-03 21:33:21 @realDonaldTrump US stocks post worst year in a decade as the S&P 500 falls more than 6% in 2018. THANKS a bunch LOSER!!

Apple stocks is lowering because they are entering a niche market. Leaving the rest to others. 3/3
432 2019-01-03 21:29:51 and none are tying democrats taking control to stocks crashing, if other way around they would

435 2019-01-03 21:28:53 I don't think younger generations care at all if stocks drop a lot.
At the same time, many would love real estate to drop a lot.
Boomers are in the opposite position. Many cannot handle expenses in retirement if stocks drop a lot. 
These are overlooked dynamics.
436 2019-01-03 21:28:07 Stop choosing 3 stocks 3 minutes, you are all cowards.
437 2019-01-03 21:27:31 My understanding is that stocks were overvalued and that the market was due - if not overdue - for a correction.

450 2019-01-03 21:25:10 This is factually incorrect.
Stocks have performed exceptionally better in the last 50 years under Dems vs under Republicans. It isn’t even close.
451 2019-01-03 21:24:36 People who invest in Stocks despise democrats they don't trust moronsbwho have no fckin clue how to make money besides in the Rothschild Bank of printing elites ..
452 2019-01-03 21:24:25 So did anyone else buy stocks in Apple yet 
453 2019-01-03 21:24:10 It doesn’t work on a 1:1 ratio. Cheaper properties are able to “ride” longer due to income stream to mortgage costs. RE is not like stocks or currency where you can SCALE out on one property as easily. Too much invested into any one property can become a big problem.

464 2019-01-03 21:21:24 Despite today's big sell off, and the dumping on Christmas Eve, stocks actually had a solid Santa Claus Rally. Avg for the S&P 500 during that period is a gain of 1.7%. S&P did 1.9% this year. Dow up 1.6%. NASDAQ up 2.4%. Russell up 3.7%.
465 2019-01-03 21:20:57 legit argument, Irene.  but: the comparison of (quality) gold miners with FANG stocks is like a comparison of Norwegian cod with fishstick. we are approaching the end of the USD-centric system - quality will matter again.
466 2019-01-03 21:20:31 Who was stopped from going to the polls?  I know that in a lot of races, they kept finding votes until the Dem won, then stopped counting.

You can bite your nails if you want, I just bought a bunch of bargain priced stocks, like I did during the crash in 2009.

480 2019-01-03 21:17:01 Stocks fell sharply today, January 3, 2019, dragged down by the Dimms taking over the House and Pelosi elected as speaker.
481 2019-01-03 21:16:22 Actually that's good  timing, better to start in a bear market than bull market as that will show true strength of a global project. It will add more liquidity to traditional stocks

483 2019-01-03 21:15:55 I hear a lot of angst among young market participants regarding the current correction, AAPL especially. The thing is if you are young and learning the market, you want these stocks to get CRUSHED, the lower the better. The opportunities on the other side could shape your future
484 2019-01-03 21:15:43 I dunno, Apple has done pretty well. It's been a while since I looked at the PC numbers tho. Chipmaker stocks have done pretty well, but I don't know if they've over- or underperformed vs. the broader indexes.
485 2019-01-03 21:15:37 How much of the 600 point drop in the #DOW is directly connected to #Apple - as many #Biotech stocks like #BIIB are up, and #Netflix up, and #ATT up as well.. full disclosure I own shares of #ATT & #BIIB

489 2019-01-03 21:15:02 the stock market is down due expressly to the dem fear mongering. I would think one buys stocks on insight, feel, and (hopefully) homework. when uncertainty is added like what the dems are currently doing, all bets are off.

493 2019-01-03 21:14:18 Almost all these stocks will eventually rise back up. It’s mostly people not investing in the stock market because there are more guaranteed gains that will come usually but not always, slower or more expensive but more long term successfull. A cheap stock is good to buy.

497 2019-01-03 21:13:06 @charliebilello  Would be interesting to get a sense of amount of market-cap shifting that has to happen for $AAPL to no longer be a significant input on most Index portfolios.  The amount of market-cap (money flow) change that must occur for other stocks to offset is astounding.

505 2019-01-03 21:12:08 Stocks crushed worldwide: US -2.5%; Europe -1%. Fear stalked the world as Apple lowered expectations & manufacturing was weaker. Combining these with Trump dysfunction overwhelmed any thoughts of 2019 eps-growth. Investors "spoiled" by 2018 are overselling on return to normality.

509 2019-01-03 21:11:03 Amazing. Sheeple will still look you in the eyes and tell you that the country is doing better than it was two years ago. I don’t know what their rule of measure is. Stocks? Lost jobs? Division?
510 2019-01-03 21:11:00 So you believe the Dow dropped, not because one of the biggest tech stocks in history released a statement on profitiability, but because Dems were sworn in from an election held months ago? Ok.
511 2019-01-03 21:10:45 I should say that high/low volume does depend though. Sometimes low volume stocks get high volume just because its popular for that day/week/etc
512 2019-01-03 21:10:35 Let's say a Democrat president unilaterally banned bump stocks.
Show me the difference.
513 2019-01-03 21:10:21 I have no stocks but I do have Calais hands and live  a vary rich life

516 2019-01-03 21:09:47 If you are impatient, go trough old charts and look at the trends. Sometimes a stock broke down in a few days, but the most stocks took months. There will be enough opportunities.

520 2019-01-03 21:09:10 Stocks down. Deficit up. Debt up. Gov shut. Tariffs hurting us. I don’t feel like I’m a winner
521 2019-01-03 21:09:01 It isn't about whether you like it or not, anyone who chose that stage is literally gambling their stocks. Maybe the stage will be favorable for your character because of layout idk, but what if the other player just try to do the most bs stuff and win anyway.

524 2019-01-03 21:07:53 Some run hedgefunds, but for me the problem is that having more money won't help me make more money.  I'm not able to buy 5mil worth of many of the small cap stocks I trade.  I can make $350-500k/year, I can't make 3-5mil/year with my strategy.  It's sad :(
525 2019-01-03 21:07:40 NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks sink 5 percent, their worst day in seven years, after Apple says iPhone sales slump in China.
526 2019-01-03 21:07:22 So when does all the “winning start?”  Stocks down another 600+points.
527 2019-01-03 21:06:59 (AP) -- Technology stocks sink 5 percent, their worst day in seven years, after Apple says iPhone sales slump in China.
528 2019-01-03 21:06:57 I am very patient in this market. Cash is king and shorting is not my game. If the downmove in #stocks continue, there will be enough opportunities to go short. Better than rushing into a small bounce.

531 2019-01-03 21:06:33 when this statement from a fed official pushes stocks to session lows, what does it tell you about faith in the system? I mean the government never messes stuff up?
532 2019-01-03 21:06:32 Deficit up. Debt up. Stocks down. Corporations sounding alarms. Gov shutdown. Hassett smiling like the musicians on the Titanic
533 2019-01-03 21:06:28 And credit when the trade war ends and stocks go way up.
534 2019-01-03 21:06:16 I'd hold off til end of day to pick up Apple's stocks. See how low it goes. Right now, only a $50 variance between highest and lowest.

535 2019-01-03 21:05:48 Volatility in stocks isn't all Trump's fault.  Fed in interest-raising frenzy to destroy his economy by 2020 is big factor.  If people would get off Trump's back the market would improve. Dem takeover of house with impeach threats also creating uncertainty.

If you think about it, what goes in a retirement fund? Bonds or stocks. Bonds return 5% or so a year. Stocks can give 5% in a day. Sure they can fall, but up long term. Will add Real Estate within 10 years.

564 2019-01-03 20:55:55 Thanks,

In times like this I notice how important it is to:

1. Have a watchlist of stocks I want to buy at the right price ( be unreasonable, the time will come)
2. Have some cash at hand
3. Have the guts to strike

Once the NRA is gone it should be a little bit easier to get more republican support for an assualt rifle ban and stronger mental health checks and many other things bump stocks were already banned
580 2019-01-03 20:51:34 All fang stocks down but 1- my favorite NFLX. Finally the market sees this company is not only recession proof but under strong management. Don’t get all the price targets dropping. I am calling for 500.00 year end
581 2019-01-03 20:51:05 About a month ago I did a similar exercise (drew lines) on many tech stocks and was actually surprised with how much potential downside there was many tech names. It's always good to do this exercise to assess risk.

587 2019-01-03 20:48:09 This is the first major decline in #stocks in nearly 10 years, which means it could be the first year for #investors to realize losses. We think there is a good chance for a strong bounce in stocks in the beginning of the year....MC

598 2019-01-03 20:44:40 Gold and tech stocks the best example of a privileged executive class and disregard for paid in capital.
599 2019-01-03 20:44:15 @realDonaldTrump So how does it feel knowing your political world, of which you suck at, is crumbling down around you? Stocks are going down faster than Obama built them up Dumbass! Unemployment is going up! Andnyoure not going to get your stupid wall!
600 2019-01-03 20:43:34 Let me guess, market is "treacherous", find high quality stocks selling at a discount, and scale in? Think I have seen that episode before.
601 2019-01-03 20:42:51 Hell someone had robbed a apple store in NY, I thought that’s why stocks went down, 
602 2019-01-03 20:42:50 Apple is fine. Stocks are down cause there is no need to upgrade to a new device. My MacBook, airpods, ipad, Apple Watch and iphone works amazing and the I won’t be updating for quite sometime. Might get a iMac though 
603 2019-01-03 20:42:27 Nah just was thinking if we could trade actual stocks amongst each other but it don't work like that. Sall güd. I only got a stock in GoPro rn and I haven't invested too much money in it yet. Still tryna learn and earn yfm? Tryna make myself more financially independent this yr
604 2019-01-03 20:41:37 The trade tension between US and China is affecting Apple sales in China and their stocks plummeted by 10%.
605 2019-01-03 20:41:09 I keep seeing these articles talking about Warren Buffett's track record with tech stocks. Listen, his instinct was right from the start on the rise of tech stocks in the late 80s. GTFOH. It's a bunch of smoke & mirrors.
606 2019-01-03 20:41:09 My elite smash experience today. 

So first of all: Why you playin' two stocks three minutes on elite smash and camp the ledge with villager while in disadvantage?

Second: Lucario's counter is perfect against braindead offensive landing options.

610 2019-01-03 20:40:28 $AMD was one of 2018's top S&P 500 stocks. But off to a rough start to 2019. Down 9% after $AAPL warning. Crypto volatility doesn't help.
611 2019-01-03 20:39:54 I've been seriously considering doing the same - I'll be raiding asda for their canned fruit & veg & stocks etc to make basic things taste nicer - I'm not much of a cook but there's nothing like a full-blown national crisis to sharpen your skills :/

615 2019-01-03 20:38:24 Im actually not sure if i can buy your stocks specifically thats not something ive ever tried but tbh i dont really see a point in doing that. For every stock sold there has to be a buyer. But it technically doesn't matter who the buyer/seller is they just have to exist
616 2019-01-03 20:37:43 THE most irresponsible thing anyone can say right here with regard to this market is "BUY" stocks. I do not care WHERE you hear it from! NO ONE should be telling you to catch a falling knife- EVER... ESPECIALLY in this environment... Period.
617 2019-01-03 20:37:41 lol, zero effect. always talked about, never an issue. #yawn  but, hey, add more doom and gloom, i want to grab stocks at lower prices again and flip when she gets bullish again!
618 2019-01-03 20:37:24 I have a buy in for #GOLD at $12.88. I can’t believe how low all gold stocks have become.
619 2019-01-03 20:37:22 Ty! Are these the stocks down most year to date or how did u select?
620 2019-01-03 20:36:50 Yes. That's what I'm suggesting. Transparent, low fee stocks, corporate/municipal bonds, mutual funds, RE, T-Bills, etc.

Returns =/> private equity/hedge funds + can apparantely save $100M +/- in exorbitant annual fees ... invest savings in pensions or KY infrastructure needs.
621 2019-01-03 20:35:49 Bud I can't recommend stocks on here and even if  could, I wouldn't. I don't know your risk or preferences. I'm on a loser all round. Soon as one goes the wrong way, @bphabsy will be on me. 
622 2019-01-03 20:35:11 mais du coup tu as du épuiser les stocks en 48h non? ^^ #thebridge
623 2019-01-03 20:35:02 The mega-rich are upset that they didn't cash out ATH's, & now it looks like we may never reach those highs anytime soon, if ever. I think that I agree with your biggest idiots theory & they tend to be the same that elected in the first place for reasons other than "stocks."
624 2019-01-03 20:35:01 30 years since Tiananmen Square which could have spiraled and was very bad PR at the least. USA can much more afford attrition than China. Regardless, deflating of FANG stocks was inevitable and net good for healthy markets.
625 2019-01-03 20:34:59 Penny stocks?
626 2019-01-03 20:33:57 Neither.  I'm mainly doing small positions on stocks.
627 2019-01-03 20:33:49 Concept, cc's and stocks!
628 2019-01-03 20:33:49 That’s the hard part, finding somewhere close that stocks them
629 2019-01-03 20:33:31 like actual stocks I bought. just was curious, haven't really invested too much tbh.

631 2019-01-03 20:33:05 exactly !!  when the market cap of tech stocks drops by another 50% then they will claim victory ... after all by then everyone would have chinese products instead of american and thus no need to have force tech transfer
632 2019-01-03 20:32:54 I wouldn't be putting any money into stocks right now. IMO.  I think we have quite a ways to go 
633 2019-01-03 20:32:49 On possibly invest in Cannabis stocks? A quickly growing market
634 2019-01-03 20:32:15 So do you mean for me to sort of act like a broker for you? Or like actually trade me the stocks you've bought? Lol all my play money is currently invested and waiting for a big payout within the next month or 3
635 2019-01-03 20:32:05 Does that mean people will have to buy ETH to trade it for stocks? If not, don’t see how this helps ETH price (which is what ETH fans are hoping for, if we’re honest)
636 2019-01-03 20:31:58 Stocks went down ..Democrats in house !
637 2019-01-03 20:31:55 should’ve got into stocks sooner

641 2019-01-03 20:31:25 Ohhh so when he declared bankruptcy multiple times that's because hes so successful? Or the fact hes raised the debt 2 trillion dollars in his first 2 years? Stocks have been falling lately? He cant make Mexico pay for the wall? Bailing out farmers after putting up tariffs?
642 2019-01-03 20:30:07 I guess I'll be holding #Apple stocks for a long time
643 2019-01-03 20:29:41 Nah like me and you or something like that. just got some more stocks trying to diversify my portfolio a bit.
644 2019-01-03 20:29:33 Corporate profits will be down and GDP will also fall because of companies selling high volume prior to tariffs going into effect.

Then they will be forced to pay down debt meaning stocks won’t be as strong.

Buckle up buttercup, a recession is coming!

649 2019-01-03 20:28:17 I am a buffet fan but even he admits he shouldn’t have been blindly against tech stocks like #google early on.

DENV virions from patients are more mature than cell culture virus -> neut assays over-estimate antibody potency -> fully mature virus stocks may better predict Ab activity in vivo.

653 2019-01-03 20:26:42 i dislike the camera glitch but it is very rare even when edgeguarding on that side (i do so a lot)
the slope is kind of a good point but i don’t think a bad starting point is a big deal when there are 3 stocks and a lot of neutral interactions

655 2019-01-03 20:25:17 @AppleSupport since y’all stocks are dropping, go ahead and drop them prices on the iPhone. 
656 2019-01-03 20:25:14 Apparently Wall Street in the stock markets around the world truly do not like the outcome of the last midterm elections as ever since then stocks have been falling rapidly, and like a rock, knowing that Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats will do everything to just stop all progress
657 2019-01-03 20:24:40 Y’all trump is such a great president have u driven by a gas station today? Bless u sir. Also y’all buy/sell any stocks in 1929? Amazing bargains!

659 2019-01-03 20:23:45 how's everybody's gold stocks doing
660 2019-01-03 20:23:29 While I believe the S&P500 has significant more downside ahead, the near term maybe more sideways to slightly up from here before the next big leg down emerges. #stocks

667 2019-01-03 20:21:32 Brought a couple stocks the other day
668 2019-01-03 20:21:00 $VTVT Would you rather short on "Day 3" and HOPE it goes down or nail it the EXACT moment the stock is technically poised to trigger sell pressure across the board to put you in the money right away? Proper trading signals and targets achieve this result. #DayTrading #Stocks
669 2019-01-03 20:20:31 @kevinolearytv Love the new podcast. Very informative. By the sound of it, you buy dividend paying stocks, and not worry too much about day to day stock fluctuations?
670 2019-01-03 20:20:22 Suppliers just restarted delivery of new stocks so we’re really sorry about the delay of shipping of some ordered prints. We’ve been constantly requesting them to deliver as soon as possible and we’ll make sure to have the pending prints shipped out this week.
671 2019-01-03 20:19:58 Stocks are making me sad.  We are positioned right for the goings on but I gotta tell you, my mood is much better when we are in an uptrend than this sea of red.  It makes people, myself included, reluctant to spend $ and feeds into economic downturn
672 2019-01-03 20:19:30 "Millionaires with the stocks can't, electric gates and the locks can't
Greedy banks and the tanks can't, stop the crowning of the poor

Palaces do fall and crumble, dynasties do take a tumble
Birds will sing, the earth will rumble at the crowning of the poor"

673 2019-01-03 20:19:26 I think we can all lighten up when the government is reopened and stocks aren’t in a free fall due to Tariff concerns.
674 2019-01-03 20:19:22 Apple stocks are going down because people are fed up by getting ripped off by getting phones that need to be replaced every 2 years because of “updates” rendering them almost useless. 
675 2019-01-03 20:19:20 Bad day to own stocks, Apple gives poor guidance and the whole market reacts.  Good time to buy some of the beat down tech stocks. Seagate (STX) near 2 yr low with a 6.5% dividend.
676 2019-01-03 20:19:19 #PresidentDonaldTrump I told you two months ago tech stocks would suffer because of your tariff war with China,but you still keep telling America China is suffering so they're going to come to the table,well mr. President Americans are losing Millions,&  China's fine with that
677 2019-01-03 20:19:13 He also said US stocks will continue to take a hit b/c of Trump’s trade war with China (not to mention anyone else). It’s as if the WH council of economic advisors is trying to kill the US economy

706 2019-01-03 20:11:09 so net net   "do the hard trade" and "stocks that are low, go lower" (in a bear mkt this is proven)   We are DEF in a Bear Market on SPX and its going to get smashed 2019, IMO.   Not advice.  Small trade.
707 2019-01-03 20:10:54 Right, I tend to think of the stocks like that in terms of the yield based on our cost basis, so it is much higher yield than what CMV is. All of what you are talking about is sound advice. In my opinion.
708 2019-01-03 20:10:40 There is only one sure thing in energy in 2019--the US will produce more hydrocarbons than they did last year--both #oil and #natgas.

Will DX offer to purchase all of these tokenized stocks at the market price? 

Presuming they will then be sold off in the traditional markets.

Otherwise I'm concerned with the liquidity of token ownership.
714 2019-01-03 20:09:07 But that thread was so funny and infuriating all at once! Also I have stocks and shit so gladly pay my accountant more than I ever get back in returns to make sure they figure out all those numbers, it's beyond my level of comprehension/caring at my age. KEEP SPEAKING THE TRUTH!
715 2019-01-03 20:08:12 what an absurd statement - this is program driven yes, but still completely relentless selling/bond buying - individual stocks were so pre-sold into year end the dynamic is inherently different at the dawn of a new year.

771 2019-01-03 19:48:50 How are your stocks Donny ?
772 2019-01-03 19:48:39 Stocks are a weird thing. It’s like the worst fiat currency ever. They are rarely based on facts, and all about feelings and predictions. Though for #AAPL it began dropping rapidly after the tariffs in China. Sales in USA have been strong, the same as always.
773 2019-01-03 19:48:35 Oh just perfect. So well he's going to get Mexico to pay for wall through his "Art of the Heel" The Canadian/Mecico deal isnt  signed. Defeats the purpose with wall.

784 2019-01-03 19:43:36 Apple stocks dropping is a clear sign that other companies will feel the pinch. This also makes investors apprehensive and begin selling or moving their shares. #TradeWars
785 2019-01-03 19:42:39 Stocks have lost roughly $5 TRILLION in value since their 2018 peak

786 2019-01-03 19:42:13 Excuse my language, but I’m comfortable expressing my thoughts in English; maybe because the Arabic teacher in high school was busy with stocks market at the time LoL

790 2019-01-03 19:41:14 sounds like a plan... except is 8.40 am ...  plus our local alcohol shop only stocks wine and beer  :S
791 2019-01-03 19:41:10 That guy is probably some high schooler who has no idea what the stock market is. Or perhaps he invested in terrible stocks that plummeted no matter what
792 2019-01-03 19:41:05 If the whole world is long, stocks, houses, etc. They need a huge huge rally to be right, or every small rally will fail to impress and people will have to liquidate.
Point being, everyone is long- everything. Trade with this in mind.
793 2019-01-03 19:40:42 Nobody is winning the trade war. Apple getting crushed on China slowdown fears and China tech stocks are tumbling too. Tough day for Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. $AAPL $BABA $BIDU $TCEHY
794 2019-01-03 19:40:00 It’s still the Rodney Dangerfield of stocks.  If it traded with the valuation of other tech companies it’d be a 300 dollar stock today.  They do need some new products and to put their cash mountain and supposedly genius brains to work however
795 2019-01-03 19:39:54 Keep in mind that the entire tech industry's stocks are dropping as well
796 2019-01-03 19:39:51 2 year note down to 2.39 or 3 basis points lower than the 3 mo. while the 10 year gets within 14 basis points of the 3 month.  Mortgage rates have fallen with the 10 year and lower rates make stocks more attractive, but this is an inverted yield curve recession scare now. $spy
797 2019-01-03 19:39:27 #Autos are the most vulnerable stocks now. Stay away from #maruti #eicher #hero #bajajauto #tvs and others.
Falling sales volume, slowing growth, credit growth tapering . Big underweight on autos.
798 2019-01-03 19:39:20 The period of time when @CNBC was just basically a daily “what stocks to buy at an all time high” cryptocurrency handjob definitely damaged their image to be a total bubblevision show.

807 2019-01-03 19:37:12 This is so horrifically misleading and brutally agenda driven, that it's sick. Filled with forced correlations and half truths. It's like a modern version of reefer madness, except somehow even more ridiculous.
This will not work to further bottom stocks or pump pharma. Lame.
808 2019-01-03 19:36:38 No Jim, CrApple warning should wake up iSHEEP all around the world to realize what a piece of crap their overrated iJUNK (with its devilish logo)really is, & sell their iJUNK stocks & buy a real stock like Microsoft, Qualcomm,...... CrApple SUCKS & u know it.
809 2019-01-03 19:36:18 He’s making it up right now as he supposedly tries to negotiate his shutdown & the trade dispute that is contributing to stocks tanking again today.I wish I could point to specific MAJOR legislation but since he’s only passed a taxscam in 2yrs that’s hard to do. Happy Pelosi Day!

821 2019-01-03 19:32:37 U.S. stocks fell about 2 percent on Thursday as a key gauge of factory activity suffered its biggest drop in a decade, rattling investors already spooked by a rare profit warning from #Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
822 2019-01-03 19:32:32 Stocks fall when dems take control of the house. I guess that’s what happens when you have open socialists in the house majority.
823 2019-01-03 19:30:48 Let's not forget 2018 was the worst year, in a decade, for stocks.

828 2019-01-03 19:30:08 I am down too much on the stocks that I have to sell at this point but if we do get a rally to a level where I can get out I will. Like I said I switched my portfolio to 40% bonds in October which saved me thousands. But I will go 80% if I can get out unscathed
829 2019-01-03 19:30:06 You aren't charging China. They don't foot the bill, WE do. Trade deficit is up. Budget deficit is up. Government is shut down. Stocks down. If this was anyone other than yourself you'd call for impeachment.

836 2019-01-03 19:27:43 However, as said, nobody has thus far linked the isopropanol shipments from Belgium and Switzerland to Syria's sarin programme after 2013.
Also, nobody has been able to determine whether sarin used in 2017 was old stocks, freshly synthesised from old precursors, or entirely new.

852 2019-01-03 19:20:41 I looked at Fuse because it was brought up in this discussion. Generally, I don't research to invest in OTC stocks. Most are very risky startups with little disclosure. The MDXG saga morphed into OTC companies because of allegations by short sellers and former employees.
853 2019-01-03 19:20:39 Really ask yourself, “who is shorting stocks at these levels”. Risk to reward doesn’t make sense to me.
854 2019-01-03 19:20:39 It will depend of event .... in 1999 we had dot com bubble and  2009 we had Credit House Bubble....so in 2019  Stocks arent overprice like 1999 and banks are in good shape much better than 2009....
855 2019-01-03 19:20:38 It's stupid to ride stocks down sell now and buy at much better price later also every investor should be using stop loss orders to limit the downside risk . Be smart!!!
856 2019-01-03 19:20:15 That really shouldn't be allowed. What's stopping other companies from halting trading of their stocks every time price drops? If cryptocurrencies are allowed to crash over 90%, so too should the stock market.
857 2019-01-03 19:19:52 How have their stocks done the last 5 years? Double or triple?

859 2019-01-03 19:19:34 Market Positives: 1) Economy still doing quite well.  2) Cost of stocks are coming down nicely. 3) $BMY purchase of $CELG may be beginning of something big (Acquisitions). 4) Historically, markets like D.C. gridlock.  5) House impeachment will go nowhere in the Senate.
860 2019-01-03 19:18:38 I'm also talking about the steady and rapid-onset decline in overall product quality, while increasing extreme monetization/rewarding formats, when it comes to an industry crash. Stocks are plummeting through the floor atm for many AAA companies.

865 2019-01-03 19:15:43 Not sure if it's been discussed elsewhere and I missed it, but I think there is still the regulatory custody issue to work out. Can banks hold DA's? If a DA is deemed a security, that implies 3rd party custody and clearance is required (like for stocks).

880 2019-01-03 19:11:30 Pensions, 401k's etc are tied into stocks, so it will have an impact. There's also the perception (optics) that a falling stock market is a reflection of much deeper economic problems.

887 2019-01-03 19:08:26 I am a scalper. High VIX makes those options expensive. ES provides a better risk/reward vs options if you get your stops right

And trading stocks has been more profitable with less risk so why not

892 2019-01-03 19:07:21 Maybe i am getting it wrong but i believe this will bring the two world closer together, you buy stock shares with crypto and the next step might be for other exchanges to buy crypto with stocks?

I find this very interesting to follow..

897 2019-01-03 19:05:17 Get rid of the Military Industrial Complex and we'll get rid of war. The same globalist that line up MIC all own big stocks in warfare corporations. War is profit, they own it, child trafficking, drugs and arms and No Federal Reserve or IMF -NO wars.
898 2019-01-03 19:05:05 I'm definitely not buying China today, but now that the news is out there in every aspect it's starting to look attractive. Most of their stocks have been whacked and I feel the time to nibble will be coming sometime soon. trade deal needs to get done for both countries.
899 2019-01-03 19:04:26 @cheshirepolice Perhaps you should delete the tweet regarding Angela Hughes on 31 Dec.

"Take profits when you can"
"It's only a paper loss"

Two of the most misguided statements in all of investing. This implies skimming tiny profits on good stocks and holding dogs while deep in the red. If you want to make money in the markets always ensure your threshold

913 2019-01-03 18:59:53 So then nobody will buy it which will then mean they will lose revenue so then they’ll start losing out so they’ll drop it then we’ll buy it again- it’s not hard to work out.

In the meantime other stocks & homegrown produce will soar heavily competing for their business. Buy U.K
914 2019-01-03 18:59:42 My prediction (coming from a Tesla fan, former employee and long-term bull) is that Tesla stocks will tumble when the market falls.  There will be a good opportunity in a few months to pick up Tesla in the mid to low $200s.  We won't see it break $400/share until 2021ish.

940 2019-01-03 18:49:51 I believe @LukeGromen's Trilemma where US can have only 2 of 3 (USD up/rates up/equity mkts up). Before tax cuts, USD declined 14%, now USD up again, so stocks had to give. I hold that they've kept this going so long by alternating between each of 3 for short periods at a time.

But one local retail store stocks them. The one in the mail can be backup (undated pages), provided I don't hide it from myself too cleverly.
944 2019-01-03 18:48:59 If it could be settled in relatively short order, then the market should recover in short order, as well, and domestic stocks be stronger if it is settled in our favor. That said, neither of those things is likely. Trade wars are bad.

961 2019-01-03 18:45:04 Lions. Obviously the trend for stocks is lower, much lower. The market move which was sparked by The President's "buy" recommendation resulted in a CLASSIC "counter trend move" which in this case will lead to, IMO, much stepper losses.

1030 2019-01-03 18:19:05 We have been advocating the return of the stocks for many years now, there is a law on the statue books from 1406 whereby any town will be downgraded to a village if it does not have a set of public stocks. Increased sales of will aid the stock market! #Manicfesto

1033 2019-01-03 18:17:59 You can distract all you can but China is whopping your ass and ours. Dow Jones down because of your foolish trade wars.  Stop running campaigns and pretend to govern. If stocks continue to plummet the jobs will be next.
1034 2019-01-03 18:17:54 treasuries are showing either money flowing here on yield or a change in fed policy

we're probably not going to experience a slowdown bigger than the pullback stocks have done, back to a 1.5-1.8% GDP, you buy a 20% dip in indexes if that's the case
1035 2019-01-03 18:17:42 Im using STT (Stocks To Trade)
1036 2019-01-03 18:17:31 Anytime stocks,investments etc are hyped like this it’s crap.I hate “Experts”Who talk abt the great cheap unbelievable stock 5 years after it happened.Knda like the horde of gold found in some jungle a few years ago that “Experts”Jumped all over.Yeah,it was faked samples.Idiots.
1037 2019-01-03 18:17:27 Stocks need a tweet from @realDonaldTrump letting us know how much progress he's making on a trade deal with the chinks...
1038 2019-01-03 18:17:21 Then stocks would be a bad investment, obviously. Do you have a basis for such questions being actualized?
1039 2019-01-03 18:16:48 Might honestly cop a few of these apple stocks tbh lol cheapest they've been in a hot minute, cyah see them going lower than this and staying lower...
1040 2019-01-03 18:16:36 TA has  definitely helped me in recent times. This crash of 2018 has indeed been very educative. TA helps in entry and exit of stocks if not selection of stocks.
1041 2019-01-03 18:16:36 It Fell due to Apple scare it causes others stocks to take notice and it caused a drop very common
1042 2019-01-03 18:16:07 yes substantially but that isn't my point. My point is that all major growth stocks have a limited life span
1043 2019-01-03 18:15:59 UK Market Close: Stocks drop but analysts don't throw in the towel
1044 2019-01-03 18:15:57 It hasn’t dawned on you why the stock market is doing what it is? Because rather than increasing wages, they bought stocks, which benefits a minority of people, mostly the ones who got the bigger tax break to begin with.
1045 2019-01-03 18:15:47 Marijuana stocks would disagree
1046 2019-01-03 18:15:19 US stocks dropped sharply on Thursday after Apple warned it will badly miss its quarterly sales forecast because of weakening growth and trade tensions in China. Apple among the world's most widely held stocks, plummeted 10% Including Dow Jones they saw it too know your facts.
1047 2019-01-03 18:15:17 Have traded this strategy since '90 and have only seen one thing change in these 28 years: The moves happen more quickly b/c a) the Internet made instantaneous dissemination of news possible, and b) Reg FD. Patterns r the same b/c the emotions of fear & greed never change #stocks
1048 2019-01-03 18:15:12 How does it feel being responsible for Apple stocks crashing? Killing the USA one step at a time aren’t you?

1051 2019-01-03 18:14:56 This is a valid well written note and should be required reading for anyone wishing to pursue trading stocks and options.
1052 2019-01-03 18:14:27 @MelissaLeeCNBC the administration makes too many comments on stocks and company specific micro's.  It's ridiculous.. they are just making up this crap as they go along.
1053 2019-01-03 18:14:20 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses

1055 2019-01-03 18:14:14 I’m waiting for the IPOs to drop this year, cuz I’m all over that. I need to diversify my portfolio with more new stocks for bigger returns. There were some good ones predicted to drop this year, last I checked.
1056 2019-01-03 18:13:55 @APompliano , you as a big ambassador of "tokenizing" the world, must be so excited with DX plans to start trading NASDAQ stocks!! But I do have a lot of questions. You are planning a blog or podcast around this soon?
1057 2019-01-03 18:13:49 Lies.

Guess that's why the economy is tanking and the stocks are plunging. 

Good idea 
1058 2019-01-03 18:13:37 High-grade bonds. Buy fundamentally cheap stocks. Wait though it.
1059 2019-01-03 18:13:26 .Financial war is coming! South Korea Stocks are extremely dangerous, when Japan sell Korean credits.
1060 2019-01-03 18:12:51 CEOs are bullish pumped stocks.
1061 2019-01-03 18:12:27 I didn't know there were Democrat and Republican stocks?
1062 2019-01-03 18:11:27 We can only hope. Stocks are tanking due to Trump’s naive trade war
1063 2019-01-03 18:11:25 Awesome!!!!! Thank you ;) bring it on ;) very much looking forward to annihilating @safronlazars gin and prosecco stocks..........again

1066 2019-01-03 18:10:22 I live in a small town that has less than 7,500 people, and there’s only a handful of people who support the Dems agenda for Open Borders. You’d think they’d be drowned out with thousands of Trump supporters, but ironically, it’s the other way around! I want to scream WAKE UP!!!
1067 2019-01-03 18:10:18 Things musta slowed down 'round the house. Now they're swappin' stocks.
1068 2019-01-03 18:10:16 US stocks dropped sharply on Thursday after Apple warned it will badly miss its quarterly sales forecast because of weakening growth and trade tensions in China. :(
1069 2019-01-03 18:10:01 Horrific idea.... Guy who came up with this should be placed in stocks outside ESPN HQ!
1070 2019-01-03 18:09:57 It's a gruesome day for Apple and a lot of other tech stocks. Most of the FAANG Five are down as a result. But take a look at Netflix. $NFLX up more than 1.5% even as $FB $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL fall.
1071 2019-01-03 18:09:52 I have an  ulta gift card so  im waiting till  it re stocks  there
1072 2019-01-03 18:09:02 Ayyye, my stocks rose!
1073 2019-01-03 18:08:27 If you play with stamina mode and 2 stocks with items, your mom sounds like old snake
1074 2019-01-03 18:08:22 You sound emotional. Maybe stocks aren't for you.
1075 2019-01-03 18:07:54 I was wondering why more people were not talking about the volatility coming from the tech stocks
1076 2019-01-03 18:07:44 Kind of like the $tlry CEO @BrendanTKennedy went on CNBC or something like that and said TLRY was defense stock vs booze and pill stocks - when TLRY was over $200...hmmm
1077 2019-01-03 18:07:24 If I could afford stocks, or had a retirement, I'd be pretty worried bout now. Silver linings, right?
1078 2019-01-03 18:07:04 What's interesting about next is their online presence. Next day delivery if you order before 10pm(I think, might be bit earlier) and their site now stocks an ever increasing range of brands.
1079 2019-01-03 18:06:56 JUNGKOOK stocks up on SUGAR CANE to CHEW ON I knew there was some sweet West Indian blood in that man 
1080 2019-01-03 18:06:55 Bump Stocks. You are awful people.

1083 2019-01-03 18:05:26 My stocks are in shambles
1084 2019-01-03 18:04:58 $spx #stocks $spy I was wrong about late rally in ‘18 but see 3000+ this year after Brexit, trade woes clear off. A broad market loss, or even gain of less than 10%, would be very unusual historically. And, we’re starting ‘19 from pretty cheap levels...
1085 2019-01-03 18:04:55 Not really , however a rally in stocks should start tonight 
1086 2019-01-03 18:03:59 These stocks that move emotionally have a lot less correlation to the markets. Sometimes TSLA is also like this. Its nice to have a few plays on these for diversification
1087 2019-01-03 18:03:53 I tend to fall in that camp too. I've never used cannabis in any form, but I have nothing against it & know it's (way) worse than alcohol. That being said, I NEVER hear ANY downsides to it, and that makes me a bit suspect as everything has pros/cons. Disclosure : long pot stocks.
1088 2019-01-03 18:03:48 Look at the new job reports. Stocks are down below Jan 2017, is that fine?  Have you read the new NAFTA deal and it hasn't been passed yet so no money coming from that.  And even if there was, the money was supposed to go to the taxpayers so we are still paying not Mexico!
1089 2019-01-03 18:03:42 But most people don’t care about it enough to know who their local representative is.  Or to have ever talked to him/her.  Also a money class in school would be helpful that thought about income and taxes and savings and stocks
1090 2019-01-03 18:03:38 I’m convinced that the stock market plunge is reflecting low confidence in Dems taking over the House. Ever since mid-term elections, stocks have been down.
1091 2019-01-03 18:02:52 Damn who'd thought #Apple stocks would dip in this way
1092 2019-01-03 18:02:39 Do tweet about stocks. Off late only see politics.
1093 2019-01-03 18:01:58 Interest rates cracking (down), big divy stocks catching bids and accumulation.  Anticipation is a halt by the Fed, or even a cut in a few months.  Look at T rocketing.  Why?  Their debt load can be managed or reduced with low rates, and their divy is ridiculously higher vs bonds
1094 2019-01-03 18:01:38 SUN biotech team views acquisition of $CELG , which follows  acquisition of $TSRO by large pharma as a positive for #SMID cap biotech, beyond just oncology related stocks – with SMID cap valuations down in 2018, a significant cash runway for biotech
1095 2019-01-03 18:01:02 #fed #stocks watched Fed for more than 30 yrs.  As data-dependent w/ every meeting “live”, it’s easy for it to push off hike 6 weeks (again and again). Unless inflation looks to run away, it will hold steady for a long time. And, with effective QT, hawks still will be appeased.

Also corporate taxes are double taxation and should be zero.

1102 2019-01-03 17:59:17 refer back to tweet week ago, pot  stocks will  move up in 2019 ,,,  even  in down or up markets
1103 2019-01-03 17:59:07 And yet Estonia, in a couple days will be selling US digitized stocks....keep up America
1104 2019-01-03 17:58:56 Yup and it is quite a plan at that , tax businesses and jobs right out of the country ! Just read a report that 2018 was the worst year for stocks in Canada in the last 10 ! Any coincidence ??
1105 2019-01-03 17:57:54 I sold nearly all my stocks in August. Timed it right for once,  though I admit to being cautious ever since Trump got elected. I always assumed we were one impulse away from disaster.

1112 2019-01-03 17:55:15 If people buy and hold steady performing stocks there are fewer transactions.  Wall Street wants transactions!

1114 2019-01-03 17:54:29 Yeah, and the scary part is its not hard to come up with a scenario where ending stocks are 1bbu with as few as 83M acres
1115 2019-01-03 17:54:28 Stocks are down, unemployment is on the rise, wages have been stagnant, no new steel mills and no wall, not even on Mexico's dime!!
1116 2019-01-03 17:54:05 But I agree, stocks are what matter in the end, which is why I think your article is very thoughtful and timely.

1126 2019-01-03 17:50:32 Apple stock is down because it is one of the few widely known stocks that most people have heard of and therefore it makes the top-down orchestrated financial blow-up traumatize the greatest number of people
1127 2019-01-03 17:50:28 Shoutout to @realDonaldTrump for helping this economy out .  Stocks are doing fantastic 
1128 2019-01-03 17:49:59 i just realized eric's channel is every endorser's dream. just get him to use/show your product and watch a nutty fandom clean out the stocks. XD for starters we already saw tommy hilfiger, yankee candle, brita, and jin ramen hot.

bet you all those things will be sold out.
1129 2019-01-03 17:49:50 So when they switch the spigots back on you expect stocks and precious metals both will skyrocket?

1132 2019-01-03 17:49:32 I wasn't finished: Ban or make it hard to purchase mods like bump stocks that make guns more effective for mass shootings. Finally, require each person purchasing a gun to receive training in how to store it and use it properly.
1133 2019-01-03 17:49:21 I wouldn’t say it’ll be like that. They’ll be regulations as companies digitize their stocks, bonds, etc. I would suspect digital assets will be broken into different sub-classes eventually. Each with specific purposes. Our concept of money creation will evolve with this.
1134 2019-01-03 17:49:01 The C.O.D. thinks you should be buying "consumer" stocks... like AAPL? Oh AAPL is a tech company- no consumers. HERE AGAIN! There is simply NO WAY to make this stuff up...

1137 2019-01-03 17:47:43 No clue what you are talking about fact is 2018 was worst year for stocks in 10 years. Corporate greed/unethical practices suck the life out of our economy. bipartisan agreement to fund at least temporarily until Trump/McConnell. Everyone wants border addressed just not wall.

Many coins are lost, in escrow, or out of circulation for one reason or another.

1163 2019-01-03 17:39:50 Just got back from #SBRY - I guess I'm not overly surprised by the state of Stocks today - I'll be so glad when we're 'back to normal' whenever that might be. It was so choppy earlier today I made a conscious decision not to look at my Fone and just let it play out.
1164 2019-01-03 17:39:18 DJIA is down. S&P 500 is down. Nasdaq is down.
5, 10 and 30 yr bonds are down.
Airline stocks are tumbling.
Silver is up.
Gold is up.
Oil is up...kinda...
What does all this tell you? 
1165 2019-01-03 17:39:14 @AbraGlobal Do you have plans to sell digitized stocks in the future to go along with digital assets? @digitalassetbuy
1166 2019-01-03 17:39:11 I got out of stocks completely after donald got in on January 2017. They were doing so well my broker insisted I stay in. Now he is sorry that he did not get out.
1167 2019-01-03 17:39:09 Lmao no tanks, just relying on my work stocks hahah
1168 2019-01-03 17:39:02 Bear market in stocks causes a downward assessment of the economy. Companies pull back on spending. Less of the latter means less income to someone else. This in turn less to less spending and then less employment etc
1169 2019-01-03 17:39:01 Today is one of those days where you look at your stocks and just close the page out.
1170 2019-01-03 17:38:53 yeah, he could have just let the economy completely collapse and you would be playing your video games in a shelter. oh, right - you figured a collapse could never hurt you.  you thought it would only hurt the wealthy with stocks.  silly ignorant fool.
1171 2019-01-03 17:38:43 The Zacks Rank 1 (Strong Buys) have outperformed the S&P 500 25 of the last 30 years. Have you? Did the "news" tell you what the analysts are doing on all 4400 stocks Zacks covers? If you're only buying Apple, then you might as well buy the S&P 500. Zacks Rank uncovers gems.
1172 2019-01-03 17:38:36 OMG I wish I could buy some Apple stocks right now.

Read the paper.
1177 2019-01-03 17:37:50 Crashing stocks will fix this.  Expect gas prices to rise to maybe $4.00 before the end of the year.
1178 2019-01-03 17:37:42 @HalftimeReport Experience.. oh my starzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  $JCP $GM Do I need to say more.   He's a woos who can't pick his ass never mind stocks.
1179 2019-01-03 17:37:30 And ultimately stocks are what matter. These flows are mainly a reflection of exuberant private investment in RE over a few years which already seems to be fizzing out looking at recent capacity auctions.
1180 2019-01-03 17:37:05 How can I start trading stocks.
1181 2019-01-03 17:37:03 Bibimbox fête ses 3ans le 6 janvier . On vous offre un petit cadeau surprise pour fêter ça à partir de demain.(dans la limite des stocks disponibles...)
A très vite! 
1182 2019-01-03 17:36:52 Stock futures keeping up well today after Trump - ISM - trade talks - stuff. 
Fed funds showing that the market is not so keen to see 4 hikes by Fed anymore, perhaps that helps stocks to.
1183 2019-01-03 17:36:49 The CBOE Implied Correlation Index Continues to climb and is above 50 now. What you have is a market that moves in lockstep and picking individual stocks becomes much more difficult.
1184 2019-01-03 17:36:25 Here's a sobering prediction for investors holding auto stocks: "We think the Detroit show is going to be kind of an all-you-can-eat buffet of potential profit warnings from suppliers and OEMs alike." Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley analyst  on @SquawkAlley.
1185 2019-01-03 17:36:24 STUBBORN:  Again I asked my brother why he is holding any stocks (he  cut back a little) instead of a Stable Value Investment Fund earning 2%.   He said his investment advisor told him to.  I asked, "if your  investment advisor told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?"
1186 2019-01-03 17:36:23 Cannabis stocks perhaps?
TRTC, LBUY. Or AKS (steel)
1187 2019-01-03 17:35:55 better than 2013? I take issue with your 2017 comment cuz i think 2013 had more stocks participating and participating at a better rate.
1188 2019-01-03 17:35:50 Are you buying stocks now or do you have a target bottom for the market before you buy?
1189 2019-01-03 17:35:38 Always enjoy reading Byron Wien's Commentary. Included in his "10 Surprises of 2019" - No further Fed rate increases; 15% gain by the S&P 500; No more Brexit as the UK has a second referendum; and tech and biotech stocks recover and are the leading sectors.
1190 2019-01-03 17:35:14 You know why they call them “bump stocks”? 

Because “crappy hunter” and “insecure male” were both taken by the @NRA
1191 2019-01-03 17:35:05 It's called profit taking? Most are not stupid enough to believe stocks will climb indefinitely, so many sold out at record stock price highs. This is usually referred to as a correction, this one abt 19% so far.

But when it bounces back up, will You give #Trump credit??
1192 2019-01-03 17:34:10 Just used my iPhone to find out iPhones are doing so badly they’re tanking my stocks and now I can’t afford my iPhone.
1193 2019-01-03 17:33:48 Did you forsee see this crypto pull back in response to Apple pulling us stocks down further. Good call if so
1194 2019-01-03 17:33:20 Vous pensez que BTS vont refaire des stocks pour les articles LY ?
1195 2019-01-03 17:33:10 I’ve been waiting for this. The conventional stock market has so many limitations. Trading crypto is so much easier. 24h markets, low fees, fractional ownership, peer to peer trading. Nice to see things getting started for digital stocks
1196 2019-01-03 17:32:55 For a Chinese there r 3 places he can save 1) stocks market ( very volatile, because it comprises of mostly gov PSUs)
2)banks (again gov owned) 3) real estate ( destroyed by local gov because dey hv2 sell lands for funding n now dere is 10 house 4 every Chinese)
1197 2019-01-03 17:32:43 The rate of home price gains slowed in November. U.S. stocks lower to begin 2019. U.S. Manufacturing activity declined in December from November.
1198 2019-01-03 17:32:37 looks like the apple doesn’t fall far from the stocks. my take, only in Axios Pro

1209 2019-01-03 17:28:17 Bright idea!  That worked real well. Stocks were at a minimum market this morning at 600 points down.
1210 2019-01-03 17:28:15 Is still an experiment that is mainly benefitting the central banks and fed induced bubbles (stocks, real estate) 
You don't have a free market with economists sitting in a room and deciding the prices 
They also have adverse effects and risks
1211 2019-01-03 17:27:51 My stocks are up, idk about you. And the government can’t crumble if there currently is a government 
Speaking of which, I’m still alive, are you?
1212 2019-01-03 17:27:18 Didn't call anyone a genius, and I'm not in FANG or S&P stocks, haven't been for awhile.  Simply pointing out recent market history, vs. those that have been wrongly calling for a reversal for up to 10 years.  And now they're right (as broken clocks are twice a day).
1213 2019-01-03 17:27:16 You yourself is supporting ur arguement with valid support for Akhilesh.

Yogi said to distribute it bcoz it was costing exchequer? If it would'nt, he would have happily burnt the whole stocks?

What do you think renaming of cities, stations by Yogi isn't a burden on exchequer?
1214 2019-01-03 17:26:46 Haha...sure....stocks are more volatile
1215 2019-01-03 17:26:41 One of the biggest things to appreciate about markets is second derivatives are treated as first derivatives, and flows are treated as stocks.
1216 2019-01-03 17:25:57 and stocks are dropping drastically! nobody trust this congress!
1217 2019-01-03 17:25:34 As stocks dive to BIGLY new lows. Consulting yourself isn't a kind of  masturbation unless you toss in a few dirty words. Just saying.  But we need a safe word. Humm.... let's work on that!
1218 2019-01-03 17:24:54 @UKNikon any update on UK stocks for the Z6??? Pre-ordered but wondering if there is any update 
1219 2019-01-03 17:24:44 Most stocks are down
1220 2019-01-03 17:24:31 For India it is changing. Majority of the stocks will become pure duds and balance few good stocks will be chased till 100pe or above and retail gets trapped. Stocks exchange ownership. cycle repeats. Peter Lynch is good for USA.
1221 2019-01-03 17:24:31 As I tweeted on Election Night: Incoming Dem freshman class in the House is loaded w/ talent & potential. Stocks bench & could infuse the party w/ solid leadership for years, something sorely needed. But for now, lets see how adept they are at their new gigs.
1222 2019-01-03 17:24:10 1/2.
Also to all Investors who still think property as an asset. 
Sold My Portfolio in 2010 (for marriage)
and in 2012 (snap shown below)  for property investment, later had not guts to buy same stocks. But rebooted investment next year n promised myself not to sell good cos.
1223 2019-01-03 17:23:45 I have decided to be positive ...

After this market correction,   Mr. Fahmy is going to give me the 10 best long stocks to own over the next 10 years and we are all going to become rich and live happily ever after.
1224 2019-01-03 17:23:20 Note that I said "trends in new-built capacity". I'm afraid you're mixing up stocks and flows of generation capacity (even after taking into account capacity factors).
1225 2019-01-03 17:23:03 i tend to agree but that view is far too broad - - this is the year that one needs nuance for MJ stocks, as they no longer will have a correlation of one - as they show some more operating history people will be able to tell what management teams can deliver and which are jokers.

1245 2019-01-03 17:17:38 Time to study the time wasted in stocks waiting for right price to sell vs holding time periods of real estate to sell. My hypothesis is that  real estate is not all that bad, considering the ltcg and deep malice in small and midcaps. We are caught between devil and deep sea.

You alone are tanking it!
1248 2019-01-03 17:16:42 Hey Dan- just a question: is there anu specific reason certain stocks have a spread between the bid and ask, besides the simple fact that thats what people want to buy/ sell for? Rarely see plays move like CURA. Thanks

1276 2019-01-03 17:11:05 In times like this momentum is either rotating or it's off and when it's off there is not a lot you can do other than sit out until it turns back on.  That's why smaller positions until the stocks start to prove themselves again.

1279 2019-01-03 17:09:55 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1280 2019-01-03 17:09:53 cool now it will get interesting for me to buy stocks
1281 2019-01-03 17:09:51 But they didn't close the 15% tax loophole for the rich... like all of them promised to do, over and over and over again. Not @BernieSanders, not @NancyPelosi and not @chuckschumer. You & I earn our money through wages. The 1% earn it through stocks and trades like @WarrenBuffett
1282 2019-01-03 17:09:24 Im sure this will happen, and most likely with the most liquid digital asset which is probably XRP, but could also be @DigiByteCoin a vastly undervalued crypto in the space. What price point would the market cap of either need to be to enable the tokenization of say, just stocks?
1283 2019-01-03 17:07:52 Stocks momentum and beta are two different things. I focus on high momentum stocks.
1284 2019-01-03 17:07:47 @JasonBondPicks Following you. My portfolio is with Wells Fargo. First mistake? How do I sell stock and where do I put the money without being taxed til I feel the market is more stable. I have a lot of Apple stocks. My WF guy just says it’s a correction.
1285 2019-01-03 17:07:46 Tech stocks are overvalued be prepared for a tech stock reevaluation.
1286 2019-01-03 17:07:41 LOL... Why buy stocks with a recession coming?

People are such greedy fools
1287 2019-01-03 17:07:20 but you’ve said these stocks are all frauds? interesting. i bought as end of year trades at lows
1288 2019-01-03 17:07:19 I hope you have the clear vision to see stocks are plummeting due to Facebook's bad business practices, and Apple's bumbling CEO. It has nothing to do with Trump's excellent economic and jobs numbers. Liberals are killing the market...like they do everything they touch.
1289 2019-01-03 17:06:58 In a theoretical and possibly likely scenario that its between the Lakers and the Celtics, what can they offer that beats our non-Tatum offer? Ingram and Lonzo’s stocks have plummeted and even though our picks arent as good as we hoped its still 4 first rounders
1290 2019-01-03 17:06:38 Are you buying stocks now or do you have a target bottom of the market that you are waiting for?
1291 2019-01-03 17:05:30 Elise is a nymph who trades stocks -- but only at night.
1292 2019-01-03 17:05:06 2018 was the worse year for U.S. stocks in more than ten years - the height of the last financial crisis
1293 2019-01-03 17:04:50 That's why the share price went down and did not go up when the other Marijuana stocks ran a couple of days ago! It should start going up any minute now.
1294 2019-01-03 17:04:22 Current levels of airline stocks is at least 15% below when oil was at $60. Do the math. Buffet/Munger might be working their calculators right now to take one of them ($LUV ?) private.
1295 2019-01-03 17:04:12 Strange. Can't help but notice that Bitcoin is really a New Age Religion. I can understand being bullish, but it's an obsession.  No one is like this with stocks or any other asset class. Perhaps just my observation.
1296 2019-01-03 17:03:56 also works well too, since his moves aren't the fastest. Honestly, they'll try to get the D throw on you to consistently close out stocks, just be sure to keep pressuring him and not giving him the chance. His kit feels more read-based like a lot of heavies. Hope it helped :)
1297 2019-01-03 17:03:45 What I found helpful in our type of strategy is paying attention to how (momentum) stocks are acting.  If I hit couple of stops then I am looking to reinvest, but if I start hitting stops on a large percentage of my stocks then I slow down hold cash and reduce position size.
1298 2019-01-03 17:03:32 @cvpayne I can't believe that nobody is connecting new congress to falling stocks
1299 2019-01-03 17:03:30 Look I’m not trying to deny white poverty or class, but among middle aged married able bodied white people, poverty basically doesn’t exist, and most of them are petty boug, earning money from stocks & implicitly from homeownership.
1300 2019-01-03 17:03:14 #Fastmoney  I do not understand why people are not happy with current volatility. The last two weeks have been extremely profitable for me. Seems low PE dividend-yielding stocks selling covered calls is guaranteed profit then unusual activity in cells in yesterday #GoddyUp
1301 2019-01-03 17:03:13 I don't really pay attention to stock market fluctuations. Stocks go up and down all the time, but dividends generally only go up. Otherwise, short-term volatility is a long-term opportunity.

1306 2019-01-03 17:01:55 Trump is increasing our deficit to the highest it has ever been. Stocks are the worst in 10 years.
1307 2019-01-03 17:01:37 "Oh no! Stocks might return realistic valuations based on more realistic earnings predictions!"-this entire thread.

1309 2019-01-03 17:01:25 Wait, be Patient and Buy stocks gradually on big pullbacks.  If your wrong, hold em. If not, take profits. The market will always be there so no need to force trades.
1310 2019-01-03 17:00:37 I disagreed with this idea until the past two weeks. Clearly crypto isn’t correlated with stocks entirely and does offer an alternative for investors looking for profit elsewhere.
1311 2019-01-03 17:00:34 Companies like @netflix denied paying taxes on in app subscription. Stocks making bigger moves this week..

1318 2019-01-03 17:00:06 Value investing is an #investmentstrategy where #stocks are selected that trade for less than their intrinsic values, a buy and hold strategy and something to seriously consider for 2019!
1319 2019-01-03 16:59:26 $SPX wouldn’t it be funny if stocks closed higher today?  Par for the course.
1320 2019-01-03 16:59:25 Algos, inv or funds putting new $ to work, whoever it is, they are so eager to get long on hope/hype/price channel. Stocks sell down on real news/data but if there is a glimmer of hope they spike hard & end up pizzling the $ away in short order. This will end sometime.  Bloody.
1321 2019-01-03 16:59:22 The record high stock buy backs should have stabilized the markets at this point. The continued selloffs of stocks accompanied by rate hikes will definitely trigger a recession that has been masked by tax cuts for over a decade.

1328 2019-01-03 16:56:22 Code for: this is deliberate so that Trump associates can up buy stocks.
1329 2019-01-03 16:56:08 Ask the stock investors. They say it’s the democrats fault the stocks are falling. They are afraid of the house and their stupid antics. Ask around. They blame democrats.
1330 2019-01-03 16:56:08 i just saw that apples stocks lowered... i mean they launch like 80 new products all of them being very expensive ... what did you think lol
1331 2019-01-03 16:55:12 trying to understand the RTY love, is it that dumb shitty stocks will out perform the lowered bond yields or is it just the Russian algo's fucking with us all again? Or is it the lack of Warren's most under priced stock in the basket?
1332 2019-01-03 16:54:56 Yea and trump has been deporting a record number of over stayed visas aswell.
Banning bumps stocks won't end gun violence so why try, right?
1333 2019-01-03 16:54:31 I say talk to the NRA, give them all AR-15's with 30 round clips and bump stocks and then send them all into 1 of there meetings. Like 5000 of them, crazy f**kers locked and loaded going into there headquarters. They are against regulations. Let them deal with them.
1334 2019-01-03 16:54:25 @turc you and me both lol. hey maybe we can collaborate this weekend i plan on reading up best dividends stocks to hold and researching them
1335 2019-01-03 16:54:22 Stocks are dropping today. Is it just Apples bad news? Or maybe it is the incoming Congress, set to be sworn in today.

1336 2019-01-03 16:53:47 Dems take over House and stocks fall because there will only be GRIDLOCK under Nancy Pelosi leadership because she hates TRUMP and she will hurt our country by trying to turn the US into CALIF!!!
1337 2019-01-03 16:53:44 Guess the “shine” has come off the apple and it’s starting to “sour”.  ( pls forgive me I just couldn’t pass that one up). Remember when I pointed out a long time ago that Apple was probably the new bellwether for stocks replacing GM. So far it looks like it has done so.
1338 2019-01-03 16:53:25 I sold my apple stocks to buy an iPhone XS Max. Smartphone, smart move.. who knows. Can say I’m loving my Xs max a little more every day :) I’m long Iphone 
1339 2019-01-03 16:52:53 i'm only buying the original ver. (bcs i heard that the DIY is a limited edition, so i don't wanna have troubles like, it ran out of stocks or something). but maybe you should buy all of them, or maybe the kihno/kinho vers.
1340 2019-01-03 16:52:47 @RNTata2000 @TataMotors has the highest topline a among all the Tata group stock but has been the worst performing stock among all the group stocks. Wondering whether the group has any seriousness to turnaround this white elephant!!!
1341 2019-01-03 16:52:19 Been plotting on this for a year when stocks was best ever knew it in the works. Was too young for the last one to get a house for the lowski so ready now

1364 2019-01-03 16:44:15 I remember Paul Ryan at town halls with his Heritage Foundation charts and preaching how Social Security was a poor investment for workers when stocks were good. When stocks collapsed, he said SS returned too good and created a hammock society sapping retirees of initiative.

1366 2019-01-03 16:44:08 The fundamental for the 10 year bull run of the #US stock market was NOT due to the "intrinsic value" of stocks. It was due to repeated quantitative easing by the #Fed. Most of these new money have gone into the stock market.

1371 2019-01-03 16:43:29 U.S. stocks sank across the board as Apple weighed on the Dow, Nasdaq  and S&P 500 large-cap tech companies. Apple shares are on pace for  the worst day in six years, down more than 9 percent.

1374 2019-01-03 16:42:34 @turc very nice it was hard 2 or 3 contracts but i feel like i came back to basics again. how much do you want in your IRA to buy stocks?
1375 2019-01-03 16:42:27 Is it going to take U.S. Federal Law Enforcement show of 'courage', in order to 'ease' the American's concerns about the Witch-Hunt- now, DAY 714, against the President.

1383 2019-01-03 16:39:10 Thanks for sending. Agreed that lower inflation and valuations make things look much more interesting. If rates have peaked, more or less, I think you really do want to own stocks over the next 10 years.

1385 2019-01-03 16:38:46 What a minute. Didn’t Dems give Obama the credit for the last several months for our great economy? Now the overvalued stocks are coming home to roost so of course it’s Trumps fault. Just love the hypocrisy...
1386 2019-01-03 16:37:56 Now that is different. Having a fund based, for example, on Japanese stocks, etc, does not mean that one has to have an office in Japan. There are many funds all over the world but they may well be administered from London.

1423 2019-01-03 16:30:24 Think good way to play banks is with their preferred stocks. 6 5/8 pct looks good to me. This might be the yr the no-man's-land between stocks and bonds works.
1424 2019-01-03 16:30:17 Maybe stocks, bonds and fiat currency will be.

If more commodities are digitised, it will be in ways as #bogus  as those of commodities digitised currently.
1425 2019-01-03 16:30:01 Measuring USA's economic health by the success of casinos on Wall Street is a misleading metric. Stocks are like used cars: GM makes no money when you buy a used chevy but the cigar-smoking salesman dressed in mismatching plaid and stripes does..
1426 2019-01-03 16:29:45 It's semi. Seriously, people need to get a grip. The last Fed hike was the straw that is causing risk to be repriced. What should happen is a rebalance from mo-mo stocks into divvy payers for real return and an inflation hedge.

1443 2019-01-03 16:25:33 That’s not what I want to think about today.  Solid argument for zero inheritance tax on stocks
1444 2019-01-03 16:24:57 My spouse & I ditched our stocks for fixed return in our 401(k)’s at different times when the market was relatively high. So far, it’s a case of slow & steady earning not too badly. We missed the rally under Trump, of course, but long term, don’t trust it! USA’s sick right now!
1445 2019-01-03 16:24:41 If new home sales can just get back to 640K trend sales with revision confirmation, monthly supply under 6.5 months, that will do the trick and most of these stocks would be up big before that data lines hits us

1472 2019-01-03 16:20:43 Financial advice for 2019: Stay as liquid as possible this year, wait for the US impeachment dip, then buy all the stocks like you rolled doubles in Monopoly.
1473 2019-01-03 16:20:03 FANG stocks r beloved. Were priced to 110% perfection. Reality will never play along. They had to correct. Doing so will crater sentiment, as mkt made them defacto econ barometers. They aren't. AAPL, IMO, was particularly at risk, due to mkt saturation, and competition. Healthy.

1533 2019-01-03 16:11:08 200 points is almost 10%, which isn't bad. I think it's better not to play this game. I mean, if you give corporations a massive tax cut then yes, people who own a lot of stocks are going to get a lot richer. An increase in stock prices ≠ a healthy economy.

1541 2019-01-03 16:10:11 Maybe it should be proportional to what top earners make - so CEOs & shareholders aren’t the only ones who can afford to live in an increasingly expensive world. OR legislate/create incentives for workers to get stocks. How else do we keep the class divide from growing....

1546 2019-01-03 16:09:16 Not just Americans. People around the world have pensions and other savings which are invested in stocks such as Apple

He's making the whole world poorer in so many different ways. I suppose at least he's not directly trying to kill us.

1547 2019-01-03 16:09:15 Hey #Apple

Your stocks are dropping....Again!

You do understand that when “We The People” said we wanted to #DrainTheSwamp that included companies like yours right?

1558 2019-01-03 16:07:40 Stocks are tanking because of Trump's stupid tariffs! And do you think the Chinese are stupid? Trump unilaterally pulled out of TPP (maybe because Obama supported it), leaving the Asian markets open for other takers. Trump is a chump
1559 2019-01-03 16:07:09 were still almost 1000 points higher in Dow than the XMAS eve lows, I personally don't want my money long stocks, though im tuffing it out in some Pot stocks, though I do have Gold coins stashed in case of catastrophe

1570 2019-01-03 16:03:27 I agree with Tony Chapman. Bonuses should be contingent on company and employee growth, vibrant pension plans, technical upgrades, tangible things, and not based on the success of selling and buying back the companies own stocks and the money it generates.
1571 2019-01-03 16:03:24 How stupid & gullible do you think we are?
We know that we pay tariffs, not "China and other countries", in the form of higher prices for goods we buy.
The economy suffers significantly as a result;
  Stocks are down 20% and falling
  Expected 2019 GDP growth is 2 to 2.5%
FIX IT!

1609 2019-01-03 15:57:09 The words "stock market" and the DJIA have been used interchangeably for years and years... in reality, the DJIA is only 30 stocks.  The S&P500 is a much better "indicator" but even that is only talking about large cap stocks.

1650 2019-01-03 15:48:25 Forecasting stocks, real growth or anything is quite precarious right now. Historical data based forecasts are based on our past to predict future. We can adjust to add in big surprises (tariff war escalation) but that itself is based on probability between 0 and 1.

1658 2019-01-03 15:46:22 Apple Inc. dramatic drop in market capitalization is crazy from a little above $1Trilion to $674B in 5 months. Tech stocks are too unpredictable and volatile that is why Warren Buffets loathes tech stocks especially the social media ones.
1659 2019-01-03 15:46:15 I think with the ISM print below 55 that @hussmanjp recession watch has been triggered 1) curve is flat enough 2) credit spreads wider 3) stocks down and 4) ISM slowing.
1660 2019-01-03 15:46:02 Babe , any big supermarket that stocks liquor .
1661 2019-01-03 15:45:50 The entire market was on a high then. Remember amazon also crossed the 1 trillion mark during that same period. We also have to consider that tech stocks have been the most hit by the market decline. Compare the NASDAQ to other market indices and see
1662 2019-01-03 15:45:45 All cannabis stocks seem to be holding up well in this big down day.  I'm in $MJ too and also $NBEV
1663 2019-01-03 15:45:14 Strip out stock buy backs (made because of extra funds available thanks to massive, irresponsible tax cuts) and stocks wouldn’t have hit those extreme hghs.
1664 2019-01-03 15:45:11 Weed stocks saying we don't care about a bear market lol.
1665 2019-01-03 15:45:03 I don't understand the bulls thesis. Fed is tightening, economy has rolled over, profits have peaked, buybacks are a disaster (see $AAPL). So what is the reason to own stocks? Which of these will be better in 6 months?

1670 2019-01-03 15:44:50 Happy New Year! I've given many examples. Again, when we completed our research we asked $BLK: "Could MS borrow $12m of FB and provide it to you to collateralize IVV?" Answer: "We take good collateral." Do the math -- stocks, ETF holdings, ETF wholesale mkt. Not enough stocks.

1672 2019-01-03 15:44:16 As soon as the left won the midterms stocks fell. When will people learn if you want a successful economy let Trump do his thing. Now the left holds America hostage over a wall they in the past said they wanted. They won’t be happy unless America fails. #TRUTH

1675 2019-01-03 15:43:40 apple stocks rise by 69%.
1676 2019-01-03 15:43:30 I think people kept buying the dip thinking it would inevitably come up, albeit with blinders on. Maybe it's some sort of denial. Unpredictability in Trump has created an abusive relationship trauma in stocks.
1677 2019-01-03 15:43:24 Means funds moving from stocks to bonds and interim outlook bearish?

1679 2019-01-03 15:43:18 Strange...stocks DOWN over 600
1680 2019-01-03 15:43:13 Your politics, your shutdown, your responsibility. You have not accomplished anything, where is healthcare for all, where are the new roads and bridges, where is the promised tax breaks for middle income workers. Stocks falling, 401k tanking. You are a fraud.
1681 2019-01-03 15:43:12 I actually just stopped putting money into certain stocks until the market stops fuggn around. I stopped with Netflix cus I read Netflix is probably going down after Disney announces their streaming service. I got money going to Disney now though.

1683 2019-01-03 15:42:35 The Dow is weighted, so some stocks (BA, GS) matter more to the average
1684 2019-01-03 15:42:28 Billionaires paying less tax on their private jets and corporations buying back stocks beg to differ.
1685 2019-01-03 15:42:23 Tech stocks are taking a beating while the Chinese growth story has somewhat taken a cooler.. It has been a tough cycle, with some stocks confirming a bearish trend...
1686 2019-01-03 15:42:20 As of this tweet, the Dow is off roughly 15% from its most recent high, in early Oct 2018. 

The Dow is still up 27% since Election Day 2016. But stocks have given back a significant amount of their recent gains on fears of a global economic slowdown.

1690 2019-01-03 15:40:47 When will you understand as soon as the Democrats won the midterms stocks plummeted. Anytime they go near anything it falls apart. Now they are holding America hostage over a wall they said they wanted!!! Inexcusable!! #TRUTH

1706 2019-01-03 15:38:27 Back to politics ... so gloomy!  A crazy leader like Trump will NEVER acknowledge that the trade war he has with China will definitely diminish the economic leadership of the US!  Stocks now are on a free fall!  Hope it can recover before the closing bell. Sorry, Apple!
1707 2019-01-03 15:38:15 No. ha ha. I labelled my stocks in Comics Sans way before I found out you hated it. 
1708 2019-01-03 15:38:11 Stocks changed little their first day of 2019 on Wednesday. This follows a year when the S&P 500 and Dow were down 6.2 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively, in their worst performance in a decade. The S&P 500 and Dow were down 6.2 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively, for 2018.

1711 2019-01-03 15:37:08 Trump was talking the market up when he came on the scene, now very few believe him anymore, one reason stocks are falling. Same with the Fed, they tricked people with QE now investors are losing confidence fast
1712 2019-01-03 15:36:42 Bottom line.... stocks are going to be priced as though a recession is 1 year away. Things still look too expensive in some areas.
1713 2019-01-03 15:36:27 Apple  stocks has fell ok will that price go down for the small individuals who like a iPhone  how about that apple  show so love  to us you guys bank  account is not hurting lol
1714 2019-01-03 15:36:26 90 S&P 500 stocks up on the day with major indices down over 2%.
1715 2019-01-03 15:36:16 I never asked, did you label your stocks in comic sans just to troll me, @DrTTran?
1716 2019-01-03 15:36:00 Agreed, lots of better stocks top buy at these levels. Blaming China was also lazy -- other major Chinese OEMs (Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi) are doing well in the Chinese market -- Apple simply priced itself out of the market and didn't offer any compelling reasons to upgrade.
1717 2019-01-03 15:35:51 Stocks are down now.
1718 2019-01-03 15:35:44 Achievements??  The Dow and tse are both down this morning again...record drops.  Not sure many would consider that a positive achievement other than the 1% who are buying up stocks for pennies!  Small investors are losing again!
1719 2019-01-03 15:35:26 alright i mean i’m down for anything, i’ll hit you up soon and we can make a banger
1720 2019-01-03 15:35:24 Will invest in Stocks #TinySurvey
1721 2019-01-03 15:35:23 To be fair, the stocks started falling because of the Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, and because stocks were already way too high when you deflate currency with hikes. What goes up, must come down. DOW was about 16,000 during the 2016 election, and it was up 50%, now up 30%
1722 2019-01-03 15:35:16 Yep ... stocks getting picked up tomorrow....freezers and that go Monday I think John
1723 2019-01-03 15:35:05 Did #Apple buy their own hype? And their own #stocks!
1724 2019-01-03 15:34:38 When it comes to TWLO and all stocks in this mkt, use the extensions and pullbacks to your best advantage. and dissect the chart so you can see where and why it stopped. Twlo had a gap fill 91.62 to 91.19 window. Hod on recent 4 day advance was 91.10.
1725 2019-01-03 15:34:36 "I don't short stocks", is not an excuse for not making money when stocks are falling. The bond trade the past few months made the entire year for a lot of investors I speak to. Plenty of ways to get this right and people are getting it VERY right.
1726 2019-01-03 15:34:20 If I had a nickel for every time I read the headline "Dow plunges over fear of economic slowdown", I'd use all them nickels to buy some cheap ass stocks today.
1727 2019-01-03 15:33:56 Jobless claims fell, and so did the stock markets during the busiest season of the year. When jobless claims fell under Obama, the claim was that they just fell off the list, not that they had become employed. So I'll throw that argument right back at you. Now let's talk stocks!
1728 2019-01-03 15:33:33 U.S. Stocks shaken up by Apple's sales warning, weak ISM data. Dow down nearly 600 points.
1729 2019-01-03 15:33:24 I've decreased my investment in social stocks by many points this year.

1731 2019-01-03 15:32:57 I like Apple products and the service. As FED is unwinding their balance sheet into the financial market, thus I think they should not buy back their stocks, should either sell their products cheaper or do more R&D...

1734 2019-01-03 15:31:47 They tell u it's correcting it self! It's not! Were headed for Depression with NO ammo to stop it! Trump used up Trillion in Tax Cuts we could have given to stop it.

1745 2019-01-03 15:29:55 Kass is already down massively on his longs. He's being destroyed on bank stocks. And he'll never admit to a loss this public and this large, so he'll just keep claim to keep buying, forever. Even though he's really not.
1746 2019-01-03 15:29:51 And...stocks are imploding even more due to Apple missing sales goals in China due to Führer's trade war.

1778 2019-01-03 15:23:59 A good question. Another is why were people buying stocks as recently as last week, when the DJIA went up over 1,000 points in a single day? Were those all people who were counting on selling before it collapsed again? I have to believe they knew it would or they're fools...

1796 2019-01-03 15:22:13 Underlying economic fundamentals are still very very good.
At some point, these coordinated sellers attempting to short the U.S economy into recession will get squeezed.  Look for a huge rally in U.S stocks early Q1 2019.

1801 2019-01-03 15:21:25 I love the idea of tokenised stocks but I can't help but think regulators are going to be a HUGE bottleneck with this. I think it will take a long time before it gains any major traction. I have no doubt cryptos built for STO's will get way ahead of the actual reality.
1802 2019-01-03 15:20:59 The greater screw up was using monetary policy to pump up stocks and houses.
1803 2019-01-03 15:20:53 Sounds very cool. However it seems the exchange is centralized, and due to the regulatory issues, I suspect you can't withdraw the erc20 stocks. So it is just a mixed crypto/stocks exchange. Still cool but could be way stronger if you could withdraw stocks and use them in DeFi!

1826 2019-01-03 15:16:00 The news cycle is turning bearish. Companies whose fundamentals have not materially changed are being viewed in a different light, and their stocks are getting hammered. This point is more significant than any particular news item.

1859 2019-01-03 15:09:14 Funny time to tokenize those totally overpriced stocks. But as this will be based on Ethereum well we should take it. Never really took root so far but makes more sense to tokenise also right now expensive real estate..

1877 2019-01-03 15:04:11 Just a theory of mine, but lack of digitalization in a clearly digitized market increases market volatility. Assets in their current form (stocks held in ETFs for example) may not be designed to handle the heavy turnover from machine driven transactions. Liquidity is king!

1920 2019-01-03 14:53:35 While US #stocks are lower, differentiation in #markets is notable and encouraging.
The change to the worse in technicals (including what some call #investor psychology) is one of the 3 underlying drivers of #volatility and weakness...and its the one most likely to reverse first.

1943 2019-01-03 14:46:36 It won’t impact his support. When prices go up it will be because of the Dems , or the Fed or George Soros... look how he took credit when stocks were going up but  blames others when it goes down. & his idiot supporters attack anyone who points it out
1944 2019-01-03 14:46:17 Literally a handful of stocks drive the indices up. Looking at mean differences in these cases is pointless. What matters is the structure of the distribution, esp the convergence of the tail. 

None of that is discussed by Thompson. It's conveniently assumed away.
1945 2019-01-03 14:46:16 @ReformedBroker hey josh I just had a thought. Do you see any parallels w us stocks via a vis economy now vs “nifty 50” era of 1960s?

1952 2019-01-03 14:44:30 Div has taken your question, which is a good one. High double digit divvies have always indicated increased risk. Once upon a time in stocks you got paid to take it.
1953 2019-01-03 14:44:26 It seems to me to be proof of the futility of fundamental analysis. Stocks like Apple are driven by the desire to own glamour. That seems to be lessening.

When Obama left office, Jan 20, 2017, the Dow closed at 19,827. When he entered office, Jan 20, 2009, the Dow closed at 7,949. In other words, in his 8 years in office the Dow went up roughly 250%.

1976 2019-01-03 14:39:13 Such blatant corruption, immorality, and disregard for law haven’t been seen like in our Nation’s history.  Stocks at lowest since 1931.

1977 2019-01-03 14:39:12 I’d like to think this would end war, but in all honesty it would probably just end up with rich people fucking more “Listen dear, I know we said ‘no more’ when we lost Chance in Cuba, and Brody died in Luxembourg, but our stocks are down, so let’s get to it”

1979 2019-01-03 14:38:42 It may not make any sense it is just something I have been thinking about.  We could have two benchmarks.  If we invest in UK stocks then the UK benchmark tells us how good we are at picking them.  But our opportunity cost is our performance versus the best fund alternative.

2025 2019-01-03 14:24:36 The additional demand for stocks from the token utility as a medium of exchange could cause massive valuation increases in these stocks. The tokens are a type of hard currency.

2026 2019-01-03 14:24:14 When you mention that I warm to the Sentinels, littering should be punishable by something like time in the stocks with any rotten food thrown composted afterwards and the offender cleaning up the mess.

2049 2019-01-03 14:17:49 Regarding the currency flash crash, wouldn't it be fascinating to individually identify who was in and out of markets during periods of extreme vol? Particularly during Dec 2018 -- who was selling stocks and who wasn't providing liquidity?

2056 2019-01-03 14:14:26 These tokenized stocks is as close to HARD money as we have ever seen. The tokens/money is actual ownership of assets and profits. 
The additional demand for stocks from the utility of these tokens could cause massive valuation increases for these companies.

2058 2019-01-03 14:13:20 Futures tank because of One Stock! Something wrong with this Market. No stocks are allowed to do well when Apple, Facebook, Netflix and others tank. Markets are too heavily traded by ETF’s . Apple isn’t down $14 because your average investor sold their 15 shares

2072 2019-01-03 14:06:17 Please get out of the misconception that low priced stocks will fly high faster giving you extra-ordinary returns. Always remember that stock price is just a barometer, actual valuations of a company can be determined by its fundamentals and valuations

2074 2019-01-03 14:06:09 if anyone think that AAPL is a buying opportunity think again. This is a very damaged stock with poor fundamentals. lot of defensive bag holders institutional investors are sitting in it. such stocks therefore take months to years to recover because there is always a seller above

2100 2019-01-03 13:53:35 The valuation of art operates in the inverse compared to stocks or commodities.  The latter begins with extrinsic value and might end with intrinsic value.  Think CocaCola: starts out as a refreshing beverage and ends an icon.

2164 2019-01-03 13:20:45 #StockMarket Hello Mr. Glitch! Trump's characterization of the global bear market as a "glitch" would be amusing were it not so misleading.  And it is not only stocks.  As homeowners in London, New York, Toronto, Sydney. The Big Bad Bear is here. No HIDING or hallucinating!!!
2165 2019-01-03 13:20:14 Dow Jones Industrial Average futures point to a decline of 367 points at Thursday's open. Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq were both lower as well. $APPL down more than 8%.  Looking for gaps and range bound stocks $GOOG.  Happy Trading

2170 2019-01-03 13:18:03 Sure but you can say:  1) Healthcare stock fundamentals should hold up in a downturn.  2) Catalysts-  growing global healthcare demand  3) Cycle - healthcare should outperform long-term and in a downturn.  Sector approach but a sector only does well if the stocks in it are ok.

2215 2019-01-03 12:51:29 I’d imagine something like that would need separate regulatory oversight. The tokens should be considered securities considering they represent a security. Seems fishy to me.

2250 2019-01-03 12:33:02 Scott, but the S&P 500 PEG ratio currently stands at 0.9; which implies the index is not too overvalued.

2288 2019-01-03 12:13:50 Yes ultimately his “90%” line rests on a dumb distributional hand-wave that because “top 10%” own “most” stocks, cutting their tax *implicitly* must be “paid for” by the rest, as debt=future taxes.

‘Fiscal Conservatives’ should like that line!, but his econ case for it is meh.

2291 2019-01-03 12:13:40 @GrantCardone sir Grant! You say that people should not put money on banks for long enough and also not invest on mutual funds and stocks. What can you say to people about how they diversity their income and are not business-oriented?

2299 2019-01-03 12:09:11 First day was positive. It struggled to get there, futures were strongly negative before the market opened and the initial trades were a strong SELL. However, the view that stocks were undervalued and expectations for 2019 are positive prevailed. First day, so goes the year?

2306 2019-01-03 12:06:05 Since the #116thCongress was voted in, the stock market has dropped 2,115 points. Stocks prices are based on future projections. The market does not have faith in this Democrat controlled house.

1, it's far lower.
2. It's far closure on time frame, current crash only. Actual would be around Mar 2020.
3. Instead look for change of guard. Those stocks/ sectors supporting market currently should wash out completely.

2650 2019-01-03 07:53:06 Nice, I took a short in WTC on close as well.  Haven’t been holding anything overnight lately but with the US futures looking particularly bearish, especially Tech stocks I figure it’s a worthwhile trade.  Fingers crossed for a Tech meltdown tonight

2652 2019-01-03 07:52:26 I am mostly in Russia for the past 3 years. Bought and sold after Brexit. Only about 5 Aussie stocks. Long China options and short the US.

2657 2019-01-03 07:45:25 FTSE down means projected corporate profit levels are down for the stocks that mainly rich people own. The rich lose money. Wahhhhh! What matters are wage levels: when they go up, stock prices also go down.

2659 2019-01-03 07:44:31 When you doing a quickplay in Smash and your teammate looses 3 whole stocks 15 seconds into the battle LMAOOOOO
2660 2019-01-03 07:43:51 Lessons learnt(again)
1) Stop over trading. 2) Stop shorting stocks that are showing buyer strength. 3) Be more patient and allow the trade to play out.

2664 2019-01-03 07:37:15 "No one will go hungry" says glib overpaid Humphrys. 1) people are already going hungry under a Tory govt; & 2) a no deal Brexit will see problems with 40% of our food supply. But Humphrys no doubt can afford a few stocks. #r4today
2665 2019-01-03 07:36:52 Rhino in SA is mostly being poached. Rhino are fairly easy to farm. Some game farmers have huge stocks of rhino that have lost resale value due to the threat of poaching. As long as an animal has value, farmers will produce them.

2673 2019-01-03 07:27:33 Another sign that macro picture is getting worse was $aapl news, it's now no question that the slowdown is worse than everyone was expecting.

2735 2019-01-03 06:37:31 Not too long ago in this economic expansion, bad employment data often gave a bid to stocks (continuation of Fed stimulus, lack of wage pressure to erode margins). One of the things keeping bulls calm(ish) is that US data has remained relatively strong.

2770 2019-01-03 06:13:12 @GeoffCutmore @steve_sedgwick Goodmorning re. Apple , apart from innovation and consumers , as a stock it  has exactly the features of other tech stocks ! once its price goes to the roof,once goes down down and down with no end in sight!so one should be so much expert to predict
2771 2019-01-03 06:11:23 I use a volume advances scan for stocks that have turned over greater than 1m in volume. Usually creates about 20 stocks. I then shortlist those based on overnight macro events, eg commodity prices, futures, news etc. That brings the list down to about 5-10. I mainly trade those.
2772 2019-01-03 06:11:22 Wts d reason?
2773 2019-01-03 06:11:21 Deal.  Stocks are so boring.
2774 2019-01-03 06:10:20 My learning was to keep buying the stocks I like that no one is really talking about. Almost all of those are black or green.

2785 2019-01-03 06:03:24 Triple A stocks are dropping pretty heavily. 

I disagree about digital. As somebody who likes to collect, I enjoy physical copies of everything much more.
2786 2019-01-03 06:03:06 People made millions under Trump. So you just sold way too late bro. NRA is made up of citizens. But he did illegally ban bump stocks which libtards refuse to praise him. Ironically less gun laws is how they could over throw this "dictator " LOL
2787 2019-01-03 06:02:39 What racism? And stocks are slightly down due to new tariffs and will be back up soon.

2790 2019-01-03 06:01:04 Our standing in the world has eroded. The whole world is laughing at how easily our President can be manipulated. Racism and intolerance are soaring. Stocks are down, the environment is less protected and climate change is being denied. Enough?

2805 2019-01-03 05:48:26 Today I fucked up Mr. David for a solid 5 seconds and still traded stocks for the rest of the set, not too shabby
2806 2019-01-03 05:47:59 Lets also keep in mind that this is our own doing for doing business and investing so much into a country (like China) 
Who ever thought this would work?

Now stocks can be just as effected by China’s economy than our own

Just think...China likes that kind of power

2841 2019-01-03 05:24:08 well the other side of that is the liberal media saying the roaring economy was Obama's...until the stocks dipped, then they said it was trumps economy all of a sudden.  thankfully i am an independent, i don't have to lie like both sides do every day.

2861 2019-01-03 05:12:43 How to construct your core portfolio in 3 easy steps:

1. Create a watchlist of 50-60 stocks- Track them for few months. 
2. Narrow down to 15-20 based on your own style and evaluation. 
3. Allocate capital by SIP(50%) and 50% lumpsum buy when markets correct 10% or more.
2862 2019-01-03 05:12:08 Your response makes no sense. I know what stocks are. Time frame of “release” makes no difference. It’s arbitrary. My time frame for release is set to 2020. Should we take my supply out of market cap? Of course not, because the whole premise is ridiculous. What else you got?
2863 2019-01-03 05:11:49 Lmao. Buffer gets 250million * 0.73 dividend per share. That's about 18million from $aapl . Sit on dividend easy. All stocks go back up anyway . Timeframe is our killer.
2864 2019-01-03 05:11:34 sure, here you go:
Gun control legislation passed in 26 states in <9 months. Bump stocks  banned in 9 states & fed ban pending. ~250 voters registered by gun  control groups. Gun reform advances in 2018 top the previous 6 years combined.

2887 2019-01-03 04:54:31 Where’s the revenue then? Why is debt so high then. Companies bought their stocks back. While at the same time laying off workers. Less taxes means less revenue. With his tariffs companies are closing down even more now. What happened to Harley Davidson. GM closing plants as well
2888 2019-01-03 04:53:54 Despite the apparent difficulty in the wicket I thought the innings of Ashton Turner was super impressive - it is nice to see emerging talent perform in all conditions - his stocks are rising as a result - cracking finish to game  really enjoyed it

2890 2019-01-03 04:51:10 I put money in my IRA today and reinvested cash in my brokerage account. With good stocks on sale, I'm happy to make some buys. Long-term, it should be very profitable to take advantage of the current valuations.
2891 2019-01-03 04:50:35 GST is going as expected. High GST taxes was not govt intention for long term. Only when excess liquidity was chasing overvalued stocks & assets, GST & fuel helped mopping us excessive liquidity & stopped rupee devaluation.

It's true that cryptocurrency is a risky investment. 

But then, 

 Are stocks not risky? 
 Are mutual funds not risky?
 Are property investments not risky?

Every asset class has its ups & downs.

2940 2019-01-03 04:15:58 I think it would be more productive to consider how play other stocks that may be on sale  tomorrow morning because of this pre-announcement!   Maybe if you care about your viewers and followers - Jim you can share your wisdom and experience?
2941 2019-01-03 04:15:20 Arbitrage works when market breadth is positive. Many stocks future price is higher than cash market. In this market u get few calls right.
2942 2019-01-03 04:15:10 Then bump stocks are not the answer. I don’t own one, but banning them sets a dangerous precedent for future bans of anything. If you truly want to curb gun violence then you would focus on the 80% of preventable murders a year by enforcing current laws.

2953 2019-01-03 04:07:47 Bump stocks are a novelty item and ultimately worthless. I’ve never wanted or needed one. They’re dumb. But banning them? I don’t normally subscribe to slippery slope theories but it ain’t a good look.
2954 2019-01-03 04:06:35 What people fail to realize is the first gun control laws were against black people. Pretty disgusting/racist as hell. But the left want gun control SUPER bad. Unfortunately, the ban on bump stocks sets a dangerous precedent. Not cool on Trump’s part.
2955 2019-01-03 04:04:05 It can be found on the Gifford’s Law Center Page. Due process was not had and Americans are being deprived of property. To legally ban bump stocks the government would have to actually challenge the legality of bump stocks in court and offer equitable compensation.

2994 2019-01-03 03:39:19 I rarely short and have no short position on MSFT. In this market it could bid up despite it being hugely overpriced.

3013 2019-01-03 03:28:28 Between this and those pot stocks...ya boy will be stressed...

Well, one of the stocks I'm up $20 but in order for it to be worth selling. I need to be up $500

3016 2019-01-03 03:27:13 US Dow Future declined 334 points (1.5%) and Nasdaq Future slipped 224 points (2%) after Apple cut quarterly earning guidance on account of weak global demand. Apple stocks declined 7% yesterday. #MOMarketUpdates
3017 2019-01-03 03:26:56 i get it, AUD sensitive stocks should be up and perhaps we are cheap for Japanese funds, but AUD been taking a beating for a while yet its taken a 'flash crash' to make us look at the market in a different light. In fact, the R^2 (6month) between AUDUSD & ASX 200 is 0.30..uuuumm
3018 2019-01-03 03:26:34  stocks = steals + blocks 
3019 2019-01-03 03:25:36 CNBC panic today spent 4 hours covering Apple in an attempt to prevent the massively overpriced stock from crashing further. It was outright desperation to save a sinking ship. I hope they got a lot of buckets because all the FANG stocks are grossly over valued.
3020 2019-01-03 03:25:11 Yes, let's compare $AAPL to 30 debt laden stocks from 80s when we had rampant inflation, a recession & Volcker contractionary monetary policy. Rates going up means debt financed books will trade lower. 

Might wanna go back to your chart scribbling or did you run out of crayons?
3021 2019-01-03 03:24:47 Expect nifty range of 10830 to 10740 for the time being. Short nifty around 10820 if it gets there or on a break of 10740. 1st tgt 10635. Stop of 10890  if sold at 10820. Stop at 10810 if sold on break of 10740. Happy hunting..

3043 2019-01-03 03:13:21 I just wanted to come clean about being one of the writers who uses that term. I’ll be in the stocks in front of the WGAW all next week if you’d like to throw any rotten fruit/vegetables.

(Weird that we still do this, but rules are rules!)
3044 2019-01-03 03:13:20 Remember....you’re not going to get rich quick trading stocks. It’s about having fun, staying consistent and slowly making money. Even 100 dollars a day adds up to over 25K a year. Think about what that could do for your family! An extra 25K by having a hobby...
3045 2019-01-03 03:12:47 Back in late 2001, everyone was bullish for 2002 on the theory that stocks have never gone down three yrs in a row in the postwar period. Didn't work out too well.
3046 2019-01-03 03:12:34 Is the trade deal like stocks and pays forward at 68x current valuation?  Stop it.
3047 2019-01-03 03:11:13 whenever Apple becomes dirt cheap value stock (Eg sub-10x EV/FCF like now), US stocks do well.
3048 2019-01-03 03:10:44 Esto viene del efecto de la inflación sobre inmuebles y/o stocks. La forma de contrarrestar el efecto es generando pasivos no monetarios y allí entraban los préstamos en dólares o con actualización que quede fuera de ganancias para el que recibe.

3051 2019-01-03 03:08:24 Well, timing wont be tomorrow or next week, but $40 is a definitely a non-zero probability. Go look where stock prices dropped to in early 2009. And then realize the world is WAY more levered today than it was in 2008. Stocks can fall a lot further than one can imagine.

3080 2019-01-03 02:50:46 I think bump stocks are unnecessary. From what I've seen, they are a waste of ammo, and I think the President fully understands this. I think he carefully used this "add on" to negotiate a buffer that will last us a very long time.   
Just my opinion.

3116 2019-01-03 02:34:02 Regardless of 232 outcome the USA can’t produce at these prices. IMHO I think if the decision favours USA producers, it may get utilities back in, maybe drive the spot up, but ultimately grade is king so I tip the scale to Canada...that being said I own a few USA U stocks also...
3117 2019-01-03 02:33:46 Not sure it’s appropriate to be comparing student athletes to cannabis stocks, Jared.
3118 2019-01-03 02:33:10 Blockchain stocks got tethered to $BTC. I am yet to see a phenomenal like what happened there in such a short window, look at $KASH, $HIVE, $BLOK, $BLOC, $NETE, $GBTC..etc all had almost identical charts. One of my most expensive listens for 2018
3119 2019-01-03 02:32:43 New stocks available....
3120 2019-01-03 02:31:58 Loving it Buffett style. Own businesses, invest in stocks. Continue to Invest/acquire both as opportunities arise!
3121 2019-01-03 02:31:18 There is no right to due process in the court of public opinion. People routinely make judgements about trustworthiness without objection. We decide if stocks are worth buying, if politicians are worth trusting, if products are well made. We weigh facts and incentives and choose.

3126 2019-01-03 02:27:54 My recession fear hasn't faded. It's only been a week since stocks were tanking.
3127 2019-01-03 02:27:27 Saw some early signs of topping in plenty of individual stocks this afternoon too.
3128 2019-01-03 02:23:47 #cryptotwitter the best investment and ROI of 2018 was Funko Pop collectibles. +110% or more per pop vs all these coins and stocks. Tangible assets 
3129 2019-01-03 02:23:06 @WarrenBuffett doesn’t like volatile stock - not sure how he will consider apple in the future to invest in. If he doesn’t buy at this level more apple stocks, he may have second thoughts about investing apple. In good days of aaple, he loves its steady income w low p/e w growth

3131 2019-01-03 02:21:31 I’d rather see the entire crime family in the stocks before the guillotine
3132 2019-01-03 02:19:56 Apple? Apple who?  Market has bottomed, wake up people. They need to sell some apple to buy all the good stocks that are cheap. Apple was so over
3133 2019-01-03 02:19:51 Stocks mean nothing. EA has dropped farther than that, and is steadily climbing back up with their financial cushioning. Don't hype up the storm until it's actually upon us. Premature ejaculation is not appealing.
3134 2019-01-03 02:19:19 Hey!  name noted but I'll inform you later on if okay na lahat including the form, kasi nagkakaubosan na daw ng stocks sa Thailand and I might lessen the said slots (yung 40)  But don't worry! I'll inform you agad when the form is up. Thanks!! :))
3135 2019-01-03 02:19:09 It's not intelligence, I think Warren Buffett stories are just pure gambler stories who really used alot of leverage & got "lucky" making it big. Either that or he managed to be lucky in picking stocks that performs exceptionally well like 100,000% gains. That's 1000% pure luck.
3136 2019-01-03 02:18:45 Wendy’s stocks just went up by 500%.
3137 2019-01-03 02:18:37 Will Bauer stocks drop now?
3138 2019-01-03 02:18:25 Don't play the penny stocks.

3142 2019-01-03 02:16:41 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your EDS
3143 2019-01-03 02:16:15 BADASS!
3144 2019-01-03 02:15:42 Lately, most of these big upside moves have been in beaten down stocks
3145 2019-01-03 02:15:14 So #Apple drops over 7% QUICKLY today on reports.  Not shocking with the global econ situation and a #governmentshutdown during the holidays. @WarrenBuffett lost approx 2 Billi’s.  Something tells me he’s a buyer with the blood in the streets. @petenajarian #markets #stocks 
3146 2019-01-03 02:15:02 (Whether your neighbor's #stocks lost big - or yours did.)
3147 2019-01-03 02:14:16 What about the prior 50% pullback that led to a massive upside rally for stocks a few years back?
3148 2019-01-03 02:14:00 Hi Edward. Thank you for your interest in the Hue Play! The demand for the Hue Play have exceeded expectations, we are hoping to have stocks replenished soon. We do not have a specific date for this, however keep an eye on our social media channels and website for updates.
3149 2019-01-03 02:13:56 Yeah, despite big drop, most stocks held above today's low too. Timing of Tim Cook's letter is little odd when revenue miss is not that much. He could report that kind of small miss on ER day. We will see, if big boys drop it and buy tomorrow and make a come back like early Feb.

3152 2019-01-03 02:13:10 The vast majority of other coins are basically penny stocks, they are not good money, more of a security - legally or less so, but one way or another, they usually depend on the success of a company.
3153 2019-01-03 02:12:38 YES!  I update my positions every night (currently none) and the stocks I am watching.  When I make a trade, it will have the TRADES tagged onto the end of my bh50k, and I will post my Robinhood account screen shot so you can see exactly what I got.

3155 2019-01-03 02:11:28 Most stocks are canaries now if the bulls would get there heads out of their assets and look at some charts for a change. Doesn’t mean there won’t be reflex rallies to trade tho.

3158 2019-01-03 02:10:50 I can see that. Would give us a chance to hop in at a reasonable price. Stocks bound to bounce back. I’ve only begun to dabble but I still want to be efficient because it’s money at the end of the day
3159 2019-01-03 02:09:57 Daniel, what are your favorite stocks for the next 10 years?
3160 2019-01-03 02:09:50 And how would AGW decrease oil prices and oil stocks? If we were all causing GW wouldn't it be because of our use of oil so wouldn't it be going up not down?
3161 2019-01-03 02:09:28 Well 2 out of the top 4 teams will always lose, period. So why include those?   Also, 5, 7 & 8 have tons of players sitting for their draft stocks. This tweet is very construed. Please correct.
3162 2019-01-03 02:08:25 With Larry on board I would be careful. Larry loves to stagnate stocks
3163 2019-01-03 02:07:56 Parsnips add an interesting note to meat stocks and such (add one or two to a bid stockpot) but otherwise I agree.

I feel so sorry for pre-1492 Europeans, eating turnips and such instead of potatoes...
3164 2019-01-03 02:07:49 As a former regulator I can tell you that a regulator can also direct the exchange to halt an issuer’s securities as well. If issuer ABC is is found to have made false or materially inaccurate statements, the stocks or bonds cannot continue to trade.
3165 2019-01-03 02:07:37 stocks are so far resilient

3167 2019-01-03 02:06:40 Does that 80% drop thing actually happen outside of bitcoin? I don’t mean like penny stocks, but for real/legitimate/economically significant companies? Or is this stock trader/analyst humor?

3172 2019-01-03 02:05:34 No. Stocks are the way to judge things AND Exxon was and still is the most valuable traded oil stock on any major exchange.
And oil prices and oil stocks are down because of AGW

U.S. stocks posted slight gains on Wednesday after a volatile session kicked off 2019.
3177 2019-01-03 02:03:57 My mother does. Closest grocery store is 40 miles one way. She makes the trek once or twice a month and stocks up with as much food as she can fit in her car.
Just because you don't have that experience doesn't mean it's nonexistent.

3196 2019-01-03 01:52:48 This is why I don't own individual stocks.

Especially AAPL.

3198 2019-01-03 01:51:47 I try not to season stocks. For one it locks you into that flavor profile with whatever you want to make with it. I use stock for a whole lotta shit (not just chicken soup) so I typically will season whatever I’m making with it.
3199 2019-01-03 01:51:42 "Lesson 1: “Blue Chip” is a marketing term. Owning these stocks will not shield you from losses"
3200 2019-01-03 01:49:13 In cricket batsman is wise enough not to think that he will be able to score more (returns) by taking more risk (not wearing helmet/guards). In investing we think by talking more risk (small caps/penny stocks/junk bonds etc.) we can certainly get mores returns.

3205 2019-01-03 01:47:11 $APPL growth has clearly slowed significantly.  They need new ideas fast IMHO.  $NFLX $FB two other stocks which need to come way way down in valuations.  I’d start buying below 

$APPL $75-100
$NFLX $150
$FB $75-90

Most will think those I’m crazy, but that’s what I believe

3211 2019-01-03 01:42:50 If we implement a rule that a timeout where both characters are at 0% 4 stocks is a double DQ, then the Puff-ICs matchup is literally a prisoners' dilemma
3212 2019-01-03 01:42:49 Those Republicans have already bundled their tax free money with insider trading to dump stocks Trump will be killing and for extra bang for their rubles (currently at 0. 014 to US dollar) they are working with Russians. They are covered & don't care about business or Capitalism.
3213 2019-01-03 01:42:35 I was more of an equity guy as a kid.  Loved momentum stocks
3214 2019-01-03 01:42:00 If you are a long-term holder of high quality stocks, do you sell $AAPL on earning warning or hold for long-term? I don't think answer is the same for everyone; it depends on your timeframe, outlook and risk tolerance. However, today does feel like preview of coming attractions.
3215 2019-01-03 01:41:58 Thanks for the tip ! I actually have a spice blend that includes a bit of everything and it goes into all my stocks. I love deep hearty herbaceous flavours in a soup.
3216 2019-01-03 01:41:30 Destruction? Lol I’m sure he’s really got your life in shambles! Horribly depressing that my stocks are doing well, less taxes taken out of my paycheck and I’m paying less at the gas pumps right now, just awful!! 
3217 2019-01-03 01:41:02 Sadly this is not sufficient. 2 more are now suffering. All they eat are Chinook salmon. For goodness sake start by banning chinook fishery immediately & boost chinook in hatcheries to increase stocks. #NeedToActNow. #SaveSouthernResidentKillerWhales
3218 2019-01-03 01:40:47 So you’re saying some stocks will go up and some will go down? Wow, bold prediction! 
3219 2019-01-03 01:40:26 I don’t trade stock so don’t take my advice on timing but Apple has been one of the best performing stocks of all time. People claiming it is dead are probably wrong.
3220 2019-01-03 01:38:26 It's not stopping them, or any other FAANG stock, from taking a dive - all tech stocks, and the broader market are taking the hit. Probably because investors are seeing it as a harbinger of things to come.
3221 2019-01-03 01:37:57 Worst year for stocks in 10 years... thanks for your amazing leadership!
3222 2019-01-03 01:37:08 I’m aware of that. Soda is one of about 40,000 items his store stocks on its shelves. Brown’s does not have a stellar track record either. It ain’t the soda
3223 2019-01-03 01:36:40 Damn stocks are rising. What a gun. They shouldn’t be able to beat anyone.
3224 2019-01-03 01:36:30 On that note there will be many more excuses - of course nothing to do with massive over priced stocks and companies pissing money against the wall with buybacks - wonder what prices did $AAPL do theirs?
3225 2019-01-03 01:36:22 i think the point that steven is so poorly trying to make, is that cormorants can and do decimate stocks of fish in ponds and lakes, and they will stay in an area where they have food until its all gone, they are a fishermans nightmare
3226 2019-01-03 01:34:40 So, wait. Is 3 stocks 8 minutes standard now?
3227 2019-01-03 01:34:21 No company keeps growing at the rate $AAPL has been forever. It's been a fantastic run, I just wish I got into their stocks early.

3231 2019-01-03 01:33:14 Just knocking down those stocks to help them break down over the winter, come back in the spring and lightly run it over to warm it up, then plant. Its sand, if I turned it black there's a good chance all the top soil would blow away if we got a big wind
3232 2019-01-03 01:32:32 Id say stocks can breakeven for next 5 yrs easily, while I dont expect BTC to do the same.
3233 2019-01-03 01:32:22 LoL the Republicans are turning on him because their rich donars are losing money on stocks.
3234 2019-01-03 01:31:57 I believe that a number people are not turning them in because they know the law is unconstitutional. The police don't know what to do (#4A problems). The same is happening with bump stocks in MA, CT, & VT. Less than 10 total for the 3 states have been handed over.
3235 2019-01-03 01:31:57 I'm gonna take a nice partial profit there

the real play is after stocks dump and it moons tho

3237 2019-01-03 01:30:28 my stocks go up 5% then bout to be right back down tomorrow 7% 
3238 2019-01-03 01:29:55 Since bump stocks are illegal in only 3 states, and they turn a semi-automatic rifle into a machine gun - we still have automatic weapons. Over 1100 rounds were fired by Vegas shooter Paddock. No thanks to bump stocks and AR-15'S. Need wait periods & better background checks.
3239 2019-01-03 01:28:33 Crypto is nothing like stocks. Stocks are a share in a company. Which means each share will be counted. You did not buy a share in Ripple when you bought XRP. So no the coins they hold in escrow won’t be counted because they have a time frame on when they can be released.
3240 2019-01-03 01:28:20 To see the future of of different stocks and cryptocurrencies so that i can invest accordingly and make a fuck ton of money lol
3241 2019-01-03 01:27:54 Bullshit. Everyone knew China was in trouble. AAPL just didn’t tell the truth. Plenty of good companies out there the aren’t FANG stocks.

3246 2019-01-03 01:25:13 I'm waiting. I think stocks in general we're long overdue for a big correction. I'll be going on a shopping spree soon though.
3247 2019-01-03 01:24:09 You still messing with stocks ?
3248 2019-01-03 01:23:57 Stocks: Intra-month top due now into early next week. Favoring as of today. A worthy low is not due until 3 weeks from now -the earliest. If the model-based stance is correct. Weak futures tonight raises conviction. What are flash traders up to in currencies? #liquidity
3249 2019-01-03 01:23:53 The stocks ranked because the Democrats came back. We support @realDonaldTrump! Hoping he vetoes every bill, keeps the government shut down, even shuts down the border! #MAGA #BuildTheWall

3253 2019-01-03 01:22:20 Squad strike is so close to perfect. Tag team is great but elimination should be able to set stocks, as well as an option for full health recovery, and lastly stage select for each match. Then it'd be a legit ironman/crew ruleset, and you can use it for streams.
3254 2019-01-03 01:21:58 So Congress will continue to not do one of thier basic functions. How about Congress no longer receives pay. Can not trade stocks can not cash a check  can not use credit cards until they perform thier basic duties as outlined in the constitution
3255 2019-01-03 01:21:22 I know ima sound dumb ASF but is possible to invest  in BIGHIT ENTERTAINMENT as in stocks and shit @BTS_twt @BigHitEnt
3256 2019-01-03 01:21:21 Stocks move on expectations not actual results (in the ST) so lowering expectations when things are bad could help beat them in the future
3257 2019-01-03 01:21:17 Everywhere RW party comes to power,stocks soar then they fall a manipulated pattern of sorts
3258 2019-01-03 01:20:59 Stocks
3259 2019-01-03 01:20:23 there is nothing incorrect about what I said Other than “unmoved” was meant to be “unmined”. So what about an Amazon evaluation? Stocks exist but not sold to anybody? Should they remove them from the market cap? Nope...because that’s ridiculous.
3260 2019-01-03 01:19:13 Stocks and Bonds
3261 2019-01-03 01:18:20 Sorry. I didn't get my intent across. Pensions and 401ks across the country hold these stocks, which will crater with single payer even being seriously discussed. I agree with SP, I just don't see how it happens without a lot of collateral damage of regular people.
3262 2019-01-03 01:17:28 Yes Bank 184 showing signs of turnaround by price outperformance over peer Pvt Banking Stocks in last one month. Deep value with least PEG of 0.38, Indusind 0.97, Kotak 1.63, HDFC Bank 1.5.
3263 2019-01-03 01:16:35 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your chronic fatigue
3264 2019-01-03 01:16:26 Anyone who listens to you is stupid.  Here is the truth.  This volatility should scare the shit out of you if you own stocks.  Volatility like this has always preceded a steep, long decline in the market.
3265 2019-01-03 01:16:03 Can we all agree on the fact that 2 stocks is the stupidest ruleset
3266 2019-01-03 01:15:12 I know.I am planning to hold it long and waiting for an opportunity to take out my investment and hold remaining stocks long term.I am just seeing thier growth.they are growing very fast . Take your own decision.

3272 2019-01-03 01:11:57 Honestly, I've lost all respect for Ronnie over the past several months. He shilled $DIG way too hard to his subs while covering stocks and other crypto way less during that time. All while arguing against people who brought up questionable items in regards DIG/Arbitrade.
3273 2019-01-03 01:11:24 I’m not a fan of this in general. It’s like they don’t realize tons of middle class people’s retirements are tied up in stocks
3274 2019-01-03 01:10:50 Let me get this straight Gun control will not stop criminals but a barrier will stop criminals ... think of it like this if u have a issue with wall street so you create regulation targeting common people and penny stocks
3275 2019-01-03 01:10:36 you may be wondering my take on the news that @Apple's stocks are in the crapper, to which i say: hurricane maria was the deadliest hurricane to strike the US in 118 years and our government is systematically erasing this loss of brown latinx life due to sheer racism

3281 2019-01-03 01:05:30 i mean a lot of this is just due to NASDAQ and tech stocks going to shit, especially after the china/trump deal and the feds raising interest rates/other threats

you'll find a similar pattern in many other tech stocks
3282 2019-01-03 01:05:22 "Stocks go down, too." -@kairyssdal
3283 2019-01-03 01:05:16 People are dying because of lack of access to healthcare, losing their retirement to falling stocks, losing jobs to robots, and you are trying to focus the country on a scary minority like Hitler in orange makeup. Focus on what's actually hurting people, you Carrot Colored Clown.
3284 2019-01-03 01:05:05 That also means Apple stocks are worthless?? 
3285 2019-01-03 01:05:03 Remember the days it was 30-40 cents cheaper per litre than gas???? Thats when dollar stores were dollar stores. Now they're a buck or two. Lol. Diesel stocks our shelves, feeds our country.. more it goes up.. more the cost of goods increases.
3286 2019-01-03 01:05:01 $SPY $AAPL stocks can only trigger ssr during mkt hours when there is plently of liquidty but after hours a stock can get destroyed on light volume and blow up wealth overnight. Makes no sense to me.
3287 2019-01-03 01:04:47 I’m buying stocks instead of the new iPhone in 2019
3288 2019-01-03 01:04:31 Not sure if you've been following events, stocks have crashed and the Trumps are taking half the White House staff to jail with them.
By the end of 2019, there will be no GOP.
3289 2019-01-03 01:04:09 And the use of abandoned Italian or captured British stocks in the Mediterranean. Though not panzers, but 700 series division troops in France with old horizon blue cloth.
3290 2019-01-03 01:03:10 Ooof kinda nervous, bought a few stocks. Let’s see how this goes

3295 2019-01-03 00:59:28 So this morning I bought 3 dollars worth of stocks, and this evening I bought 3 dollars worth of lottery tickets. Let’s see which is a better investment.
3296 2019-01-03 00:59:22 Tfw you're playing a match on quickplay, notice that the timer goes "5, 4, 3, 2, 1", you look down and notice it was 2 stocks the entire time, and you get frozen by icies instantly in sudden death
3297 2019-01-03 00:59:07 Actually, if memory serves now I think @MrsJayzTwoCents got it custom made for him for his birthday. I don't think he ever actually sold it now that I think about it. Oh well, I'll only buy one if he ever stocks it.
3298 2019-01-03 00:58:25 Warren Buffet’s favorite holding period of stocks is “forever”.. so i don’t think he pumps and dumps
3299 2019-01-03 00:58:00 Fais gaffe va y avoir des rupturez de stocks ds les fast food ah ah
3300 2019-01-03 00:57:28 Was wondering about how the stocks market hit the lows of 2008.. Folks at Mara Largo really wanted to talk to you about that..but you knew that, so you didn’t go.. Coward!
3301 2019-01-03 00:57:03 Whatever Gerber. You are rich now man. I'm just trying to make some Income and these billionaires keep nuking their own stocks to buyback lower. I almost recovered being down 17k now tomorrow probably down 6k  . FML dude. fml. Never win. I just want to retire in Colorado
3302 2019-01-03 00:56:56 A who's who of worst stocks to own in 2018. And, inshallah, 2019 as well.
3303 2019-01-03 00:56:41 I meant to RT one of my posts from Dec 21 but accidentally deleted it instead. Just wanted to remind you all that bear market rallies are notoriously unreliable, so anyone older than 50 should cash out of the market now. Stocks have only begun to give back gains from years of QE.
3304 2019-01-03 00:56:18 yes it is and not sure 2019 is starting off better for stocks people own like $AAPL... $AAPL after hours trading just got mauled...down almost 8% after revenue guidance announcement...
3305 2019-01-03 00:56:09 Netflix please get the show back....or else.your stocks gonna tank....

3307 2019-01-03 00:55:33 I completely understand that!! Do people who need to buy thrifted clothes need the hottest gear though?? It’s also not like it’s selling out and all disappearing  
Stocks constantly rolling over always, there’s so much abundance, if not it goes to landfill which is no good!!
3308 2019-01-03 00:55:29 People are dying because of lack of access to healthcare, losing their retirement to falling stocks, losing jobs to robots, and you are trying to focus the country on a scary minority like Hitler in orange makeup. Focus on what's actually hurting people, you Carrot Colored Clown.
3309 2019-01-03 00:55:24 Yup, most people probably have some type of financial advisers that they should consider. I’m just talking about my slight knowledge in stocks and what I have always heard “buy low, sell high”
3310 2019-01-03 00:54:42 Thank you sir. i have another question, i'm a college student and me and my friends we always argue about what is better long term. stocks or real state, what do you think? Thanks!
3311 2019-01-03 00:54:19 Dont jinx!!! Pot stocks keep mooning then we buy Apple with profits at 40$.. who wants to buy apple at 158$ anyways????
3312 2019-01-03 00:53:26 Guys before I start with updates let me just say some of the stocks on tomorrow's list are explosive
3313 2019-01-03 00:50:42 2/? With traditional markets, I have no fear about an investment going to zero. With crypto, I have a very real fear that it could go to zero. Stocks and even FOREX are regulated, and will never go to zero. If they do bc its the end of the world and money doesn't matter anyway.
3314 2019-01-03 00:49:41 Yup!! They leave carts sometimes of things that stock.  I think it's every Tuesday or Wednesday, they leave a cart of rope and chain that stocks
3315 2019-01-03 00:48:04 End the trade war numb nutts you are single handily destroying the economy... $AAPL $FDX $SPY #stocks
3316 2019-01-03 00:47:27 Simple correction after stocks ran up to fast in 2017.
3317 2019-01-03 00:47:00 A man in Saudi Arabia has installed a fridge on the street and stocks it with free food for the homeless people in his neighborhood.
3318 2019-01-03 00:46:43 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your ADHD
3319 2019-01-03 00:46:20 Keep investing in low PE stocks. It's a no brainer.
3320 2019-01-03 00:46:07 I notice that you trade a lot of the same stocks.  How many stocks do you recommend following?  I was thinking of studying 8-10 and trading only those.
3321 2019-01-03 00:44:55 Stocks have soared as my gambling picks have stunk.
3322 2019-01-03 00:44:26 If you want to make money, just bet against and short all the stocks Ross likes. 
I was up 38% last year by going against Ross.....lolol
3323 2019-01-03 00:44:10 It went down. That's about it. Stocks do that on the way up too.
3324 2019-01-03 00:43:49 January stocks...
Pm me for your orders
3325 2019-01-03 00:43:06 If I told you that next year we’d have 3% GDP, no wars, huge fiscal stimulus for corporations, record buybacks, high consumer confidence, wage growth and 25% earnings growth, you’d probably forecast a double-digit gain for stocks during that year, wouldn’t you? Not down 6%...2018
3326 2019-01-03 00:42:40 Does anyone invest in stocks? Thinking about giving it a shot. Want to start small and see what happens. Is Robinhood a good app to use?
3327 2019-01-03 00:41:54 Weed stocks are the new growth stocks
3328 2019-01-03 00:40:43 Good time to make a list of crazy low bids on stocks you want to own. $AAPL $129
3329 2019-01-03 00:39:54 Man, it's a good thing I'm too poor to have any stocks.
3330 2019-01-03 00:39:30 I loved the idea but seemed like no politicians were willing to help explain it. Saving/investing surpluses seems a lot better than spending them. I would have been ok w/o personal accounts - just a big pool of SS surpluses invested 50/50 in stocks & bonds via index funds.
3331 2019-01-03 00:39:10 (3) Elites more likely to have diversified portfolio. When stocks tank, they compensate. If they are running a business, they make cuts. (4) As others here have said, they just got a windfall in tax "reform". Probably can weather the volatility. ...
3332 2019-01-03 00:38:37 Bought my first stocks the other day and I’m already addicted 
3333 2019-01-03 00:38:14 also cleaning all three stocks without taking another hit jfc brutal
3334 2019-01-03 00:37:19 (1) We're maybe not buying individual stocks, but all our retirement is in stock market via 401(k)s etc. (2) Elites more likely to be trading individual stocks, then aren't they the folks deciding by their actions what the prices are? ...
3335 2019-01-03 00:37:10 Walt Disney stocks were low today. Which, I find odd, considering so many kids are here and newborns being born to the staple.
3336 2019-01-03 00:35:54 I purchased a few stocks and bonds lastnight for my birthday 
3337 2019-01-03 00:34:18 Define the " right path ". List your employees who gave away thousands of crores to the 'borrowers'. List your employees who attested to value of stocks in warehouse. Liquidate your assets to repay investors with interest. #NSEL @NSELfight @naara_nselrg 13000 investors suffering
3338 2019-01-03 00:33:59 Buy bonds.  Spend ur time wisely.  Stocks r not 4 the wise.
3339 2019-01-03 00:33:50 I think we are learning a lot about economy manipulation, right now.  Currency, stocks, all kinds of numbers.  Never forget that Fraudster is in charge, who loves to push fake everything.
3340 2019-01-03 00:33:08 $AAPL is taking stocks down hugh AH. Retest, soon?

3342 2019-01-03 00:32:54 I’m definitely a bad investment magnet; 
- I bought GoPro stocks, GoPro decided to retire their Drone department
- I bought Snapchat options, well we all know the rest 
- Recently bought Apple stocks, Apple expecting $9 billion loss in iPhone sales because of weak demand
3343 2019-01-03 00:32:38 Hey @SenateGOP and @HouseGOP your “savior” is tanking the economy over a racist wall you don’t even want. You’d think your mercenary little souls would do something about your stocks plummeting. Or does Put(a)in pwn you too much?
3344 2019-01-03 00:32:28 Many of these stocks will prove to be at ridiculously low valuations. Biotech always tricky because in the short to medium term its almost all sentiment.
3345 2019-01-03 00:32:26 It definitely hurt my portfolio, but I have others good stocks to compensate in the meantime:) $SBUX, $MSFT for example
3346 2019-01-03 00:31:59 J’ai tellement de chips, bouteilles, cubis et autres restes de ma soirée du nouvel an rab chez moi. J’ai des stocks pour 6 mois.
3347 2019-01-03 00:31:18 If you don’t take the signs of the FX and Bond market that stocks are in trouble right now, it’s your own fault $SPX $QQQ $DJI $USDJPY $TLT #investing #share2steem #steemsilvergold #money
3348 2019-01-03 00:30:18 Except for bump stocks. That’s not your right.
3349 2019-01-03 00:30:03 Actually if you are an innovative contrarian this is a golden window.... perfect time to start a selective Tech Short Fund. Look at the FANG stocks along w many others that went into free fall mode. 

Somebody made the profits & it wasnt the guys pictured above giving advice! 
3350 2019-01-03 00:29:36 I’m surprised that you went through all of this trouble. Because you’ve wasted your time and found what I said in April to prove a ridiculous point, it’s not the same thing I’ve said now. I would’ve shorted stocks in late October, but the ^VIX is too high.
3351 2019-01-03 00:28:43 I think 2019 is going to be a big year for US pot stocks. Most Canadian companies already got big contracts/ institutional support + on all major exchanges and I really cant think of another massive catalyst sector wide to bring back FOMO... lots of upside to find.
3352 2019-01-03 00:26:20 Di umur segini baru ngeh kalo ekonom yg baik adalah ekonom yg  berpengalaman di pasar keuangan (forex, stocks, mutual funds, etf, futures, options, komoditas, etc) karna disitu sarang duit kapitalis dan tempat spekulasi yg berpotensi menghancurkan perekonomian.
3353 2019-01-03 00:25:36 Stocks have tanked! That's bad. The market sucks. #TrumpResign
3354 2019-01-03 00:25:18 So are stocks and 401ks
3355 2019-01-03 00:24:56 I’m in both.. But, I will not sell my stocks until crypto is adopted. Crypto is not regulated and could turn into a massive scam at any point. Although I do believe in crypto I’m also not willing to lose it all.. lol
3356 2019-01-03 00:23:18 And our stocks will rise High @realDonaldTrump #ShutDownTrump #WhiteSupremacy #WhiteSupremacist #VoteBlue

3364 2019-01-03 00:20:09 I remember buying an entry rate newsletter on smart commodity stocks in 2007, but it turns out I was the commodity, so wet behind the ears I'd trade a crappy micro-cap stock at their recommendation.

3366 2019-01-03 00:19:00 If you've got an #antique #firearm, think twice before having it restored. Many #collectors prefer them in their original state rather than to risk an shoddy restoration. Oiled stocks and a good cleaning are often enough.
3367 2019-01-03 00:18:38 Well people like me only support company’s that we think has potential I can’t wait to see were you guys go if I knew how I would totally buy your stocks because I am sure if you guys keep up your standards and keep putting your customers first you will be a huge company
3368 2019-01-03 00:18:32 “..after years when stocks finish between down 5 percent and up 5 percent, the next year has averaged 24 percent, including dividends.”
3369 2019-01-03 00:18:01 How many stocks tend to follow this, 1 of 10

3374 2019-01-03 00:15:53 If you already have stocks, then liquidation requires selling those stocks. Why not just say what he means, i.e., "convert all your assets to stocks"?

3385 2019-01-03 00:07:38 Damn I missed it! What are your thoughts on ravencoin and polymath? Tokenized assets and stocks. I read ravencoin white paper and they make the case it is more fine tuned for this than btc. do you think BTC will evolve to be able to handle this eventually making rvn obsolete?

3387 2019-01-03 00:07:08 For sure. Apple was a trillion dollar company early in 2018 and I saw the value today and it was around $700 billion. They lost a ton of value. This has the potential to get ugly for the FAANG stocks
3388 2019-01-03 00:07:03 The stories of supercharger lines on public holidays and smash repair backups and clogged service centers are not going away. 
Apple just holed high PE growth techie stocks - which appear to be a core driver of “I am rich enough to buy a luxury car” feelings.

3391 2019-01-03 00:05:42 Day 2:
- Trump says Mexico is paying for the wall through the new usmca trade deal.

- Women On Bernie Sanders 2016 Campaign Tell The ‘New York Times’ The Sexism They Faced
3392 2019-01-03 00:05:33 GSP is so fucking stupid. How the fuck can you lose 600,000 points for a shitty matchup of 2 stocks on a regular stage with your only death being the 2 sides of the stage?

But when you win a match, you only get 100,000 gsp?
3393 2019-01-03 00:04:53 If we just build a wall around Wall Street, we can keep the caravan away from the stocks.
3394 2019-01-03 00:04:47 They should be banned from owning stocks.
3395 2019-01-03 00:04:40 The Dow is STILL in record #s and i can only IMAGINE what stocks would be if the MSM and Congress actually worked WITH Trump instead of against America....
3396 2019-01-03 00:04:36 There should be some good stocks on sale tomorrow.  Always a bright side!
3397 2019-01-03 00:04:27 Why go long in stocks when you know recessions are real?
3398 2019-01-03 00:03:44 Anyone saying 2 stocks have a hard time winning 3 stocks. 2 Stocks in this game is absolutely terrible. Also anyone know a good ruleset for Teams? Because I go to search for teams and end up getting put into a 1v1 match 80% of the time. Rather annoying.
3399 2019-01-03 00:03:04 Its still huge difference though. This was the most solid stock. Now, what will the other faangs do. These were agenda stocks to run the world. I dont doubt a couple may go bust now.
3400 2019-01-03 00:03:02 Sorry mami but if your not looking to buy a house invest in stocks and build an awesome portfolio and obtain lots of assets and live our best life. You can’t be my woman.
3401 2019-01-03 00:02:37 i made $30 trading penny stocks today
3402 2019-01-03 00:02:23 Too bad I had stocks in American oil companies. You've basically driven them out of business so that Saudi Arabia can reap MASSIVE amounts of our cash. "Quick cash" is not always the smartest investment.... #taxes #gastax #oilprice #SaudiArabia #trump #GOP
3403 2019-01-03 00:02:19 So, when stocks, commodities, etc are settled in $BTC then I guess you’ll have digital gains/losses until you sell/cover

Goodbye paper gains/losses...think of all the trees #bitcoin will save 
3404 2019-01-03 00:02:02 Misplaced apostrophes are why we still use stocks and offal.
3405 2019-01-03 00:01:29 Gonna change my FX chart list name to "Weed Stocks" since the $5T a day FX market trades like cannabis coins
3406 2019-01-03 00:01:19 Uhh ohh, trumpy trade war hurting. Lookout below Nasdaq and china stocks. 100% due to iphone and china per tim cook.
3407 2019-01-03 00:01:00 Maaaaaan wtf!! I made a whole E-Trade account thinking it was for trading Pokémon and it’s for investment planning and stocks.

Anyways, does anybody want to trade a Snorlax for 10 shares of Netflix?
3408 2019-01-03 00:00:56 If they were Betty’s mince pies I can understand the problem. I still have stocks so can help out if you need a fix.
3409 2019-01-03 00:00:40 Sell high and buy low. If you are borrowing stocks to sell in a margin account, then you must eventually replace those stocks. You do so at a profit if the stock is replaced at a lower price than you sold it allowing you to keep the difference. The market going down helps.
