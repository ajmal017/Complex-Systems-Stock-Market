10 2018-04-05 23:01:59 There is no 'naive consumer' who 'believes' that commodities are animate beings. Asked if they think that commodities are alive or possess will, consumers will snort derisively. Nevertheless, they will continue to *act* as if commodities are animate entities.

"Now, shall we change you?"
40 2018-04-05 22:31:35 Yeah, there are market opportunities because cultural commodities tend to not be aimed towards those with conservative values, so when something arises, I would assume a large % would gravitate towards it.
41 2018-04-05 22:31:08 So you take that defeatist attitude add in a large segment of the population who is locked into poverty and want socialism and have a guy who oversaw a massive economic resurgence (thanks to commodities) and next thing you know your EX ain't looking half bad.
42 2018-04-05 22:30:59 Debord's thesis 66 from "the Society of the Spectacle": “Every given commodity fights for itself, cannot acknowledge the others, and attempts to impose itself everywhere as if it were the only one,” And since social media influencers are commodities, this is also true of people
43 2018-04-05 22:30:18 My husband works as a commodities mgr. for a major manufacturing company. They sent out an email from the Direct Sourcing Manager warning about what this will mean for their products.  This business will be hurt exponentially as they use steel in everything they make.
44 2018-04-05 22:21:15 That's the first step. Other things you can do is slowly transition to using essential products and commodities that are cruelty free and vegan friendly. This is something you can do way after you get comfortable eating a plant-based diet.

46 2018-04-05 22:19:17 I am definitely of the rotation out of tech into late cycle commodities view.  Hopefully we are dealing with a minor USD counter trend rally and then it's game on.  We are somewhere between 2000/2001 or 2007/08 type scenario.  Fingers crossed.
47 2018-04-05 22:19:00 Why appreciate the CNY and take austerity when you borrow USD up to the rafters to buy real assets all over the world, gain physical control of a large share of global commodities and THEN appreciate the CNY?  :)
48 2018-04-05 22:09:34 This cock-womble just proved his naivety about international trade to the world.

Ironically, when prices of basic commodities (some come in aluminium cans) increase in price, his supporters will believe Trump's rhetoric that the prices increased because of immigrants.

54 2018-04-05 21:28:34 Doesn’t the $20 remain the same, its the commodities value or worth which fluctuates.  That in turn reflects the value of the $20?  Are we saying the same thing ?  Just you’re Irish?

56 2018-04-05 21:13:36 As a NOLA expat, count me as a Brees fan.  He's a smart - and very nice - fella. But there are always a limited number of buyers for niche-y commodities like stones, jade and rare books. Almost invariably, that means amateurs get jacked when they sell.

59 2018-04-05 21:02:54 This game is pay to play. Don’t ever forget it. Ain’t shit free. Time & effort are the most precious and costly commodities.
60 2018-04-05 21:01:19 We only respect people with money and power for these two commodities we are will to look the other way for everything else. Than we wonder y v r in this situation v find ourselves in.
61 2018-04-05 21:01:06 “Securities fraud, also known as stock fraud & investment fraud, is a deceptive practice n the stock or commodities markets that induces investors to make purchase or sale decisions on the basis of false information, frequently resulting n losses, n violation of securities laws.”
62 2018-04-05 20:59:31 Eh... soybeans, like most commodities are fungible.   Other exporters to China would increase their shipments while U.S. increases shipments to other demand spots.  Why would it be a Soynami?  Tariffs on commodities merely create logistical inefficiencies.
63 2018-04-05 20:47:25 We have way too many trains hauling oil that are needed for other valuable commodities when, if not for foreign leftist and the Trudeau Liberals, could be going thru pipelines.
64 2018-04-05 20:45:51 A prosperous 17th century Western lifestyle based on commodities imported from other sophisticated cultures in the wider world has its precedents in Medieval spice trade from the Orient #Civilisations (BBC2).
65 2018-04-05 20:42:22 7/ Finally, much of the velocity argument centers around MV=PQ. Many don't believe it applies to crypto (and we lack evidence it works today), particularly for crypto that have their own token economics and act as currencies/MOEs, SOVs, and commodities within their networks.
66 2018-04-05 20:42:17 True, although not by factor of three. And some commodities (like tires now and batteries later) have lower margins.
67 2018-04-05 20:40:17 "Society’s understanding of human trafficking and prostitution needs to change. In my country, people believe that prostitutes are criminals and buyers are the victims. This is wrong… Women are human beings, not commodities to be bought and sold."

That he thinks sick Americans are commodities to be exploited by the healthcare industry? I’m sure he HAS written a book (I don’t care to google) and I have no prob w/it
70 2018-04-05 20:32:53 "Celebrities are human beings who allow themselves into commodities for mass visual consumptions."
71 2018-04-05 20:32:45 Under neoliberal #freetrade, China & India are meant to dominate industrial production, using cheap labor w/ designs & methods purchased or stolen from the US. America is to wage war & export commodities, which keeps developing countries destabilized & desperate for exploitation.
72 2018-04-05 20:22:44 One of the biggest commodities all communications services have to sell is usage trends, location, and contact information. It’s the new oil. If you’re here, or using a computer, wireless phone, using a customer card at the store...your data is for sale.

74 2018-04-05 20:15:14 CNN was playing behind me as I made a presentation on how best to present the comparative ethics of our Commodities Package vs the competition. I actually coined the term "Fake Dues" extemporaneously for entities who charge a platform fee.

92 2018-04-05 18:55:41 Si trump no baja, la "mejor" decisión de China es no hacer nada, evitar la escalada comercial, sobretodo en commodities / materias primas. Pero eso es siendo racional, en caliente puede ir a una colisión, en la que sufrirá daños pero al menos "abollará" un poco a los gringos.
93 2018-04-05 18:55:17 BITRACE INVESTMENTS LTD has succeeded to finalize a deal with BDSwiss Holding PLC, to allow its investors (BITRACE Buyers) to Trade Shares, Indices, FOREX, Commodities and Cryptocurrencies with CFDs, using BITRACE Tokens. #BITRACE
94 2018-04-05 18:51:58 Bob McNair has made it obvious, by doubling down on his statement, that he doesn't care one bit about the Texans' players...of any color. He views players as inmates, commodities that can be bought and controlled. #Texans #NFL #McNair
95 2018-04-05 18:49:51 Why? That's like a wage increase followed by the price of commodities going up, you're still in the same boat. Fare evasion is a conscious decision as much as driving a car without a valid license,  so let us decriminalize it also
96 2018-04-05 18:47:27 Trump's idiotic approach to trade: Even though no actual tariffs have been put in place, futures prices have already dropped in the commodities affected, hitting pocketbooks of producers. Try deplomacy first, next time Mr. Stable Genius.

101 2018-04-05 18:38:11 Two things are clear at the moment.  1. BTC and ETH are considered “currency” and/or “commodities,” depending upon which statute is in play (‘33, ‘34, ‘40 Act, CEA).  2. Many token are securities under the Howey test.   “Utility tokens” remain big grey area.
102 2018-04-05 18:37:37 The mistreatment of NFL players is something you’d never see tolerated in the NBA or MLB. From the handling of concussions, to the racist undertones, to being viewed as commodities. The owners don’t care about their players.
103 2018-04-05 18:35:29 These guys play through all sorts of potentially career ending injuries just because Franchise's treat them like commodities & want results now. I am glad that players r taking care of themselves & hope that Franchises recognise dividends can come later from being supportive now
104 2018-04-05 18:33:08 Other than the initial shock, stocks  won’t be the first thing hit by Trump’s trade war. It will be one of the last. Fall in commodities, durable goods, and consumer confidence will precede the stock market. Once stocks react, it will be too late.
105 2018-04-05 18:31:11 Cotton (K18)-Not bad. We were able to take profits on the balance of our shorts @ 79.60/79.85, (78.62 low), and then set longs & took profits @ 81.85/82.70, (82.64 high). #ICEUS #ICE #COTTON #SOFTS #COMMODITIES
106 2018-04-05 18:30:02 Looooool...
Jim Rickards.. the guy shouting dollar collapse all day, BTC is a scam, and to buy gold because he have a vested interest in it.
Gold went into a bear market since 2011 with most other commodities. 

He’s irresponsible and biased.

109 2018-04-05 18:27:49 ok now we on the same page. I am a fan of crypto as an emerging market. I am here to learn and educate. Bitcoin would be deflationary if we jut had the one currency, Bitcoin.  Newcomers are looking for, the next Bitcoin. I see crypto as commodities rather than currencies.

126 2018-04-05 16:55:34 obviously you haven't been paying attention the last few decades as China has tariffs on just about everything they import from us, and their subsidized "dumping" of commodities on our market below market price has put many of our industries out of business.
127 2018-04-05 16:50:49 I've always viewed Clinton's 2000 Commodities Modernization Act forbidding the regulation of derivatives as the official starting starting pistol for the eventual crisis. Read "All The Devi;s Are Here" and "13 Bankers" for excellent analyses of it.

152 2018-04-05 15:19:38 If u think that capitalism can be "improved" via higher wages, less alienating working conditions, cheaper yet better commodities, &c whilst direct producers remain separated from the still commodified and privately owned means of production and subsistence, u're confused.
153 2018-04-05 15:19:05 I do recognize that you don’t get to set prices for inputs, or commodities. And I recognize that this is very frustrating.  I grew up and worked in ag.  But the concept that nothing can ever be done simply isn’t true.

228 2018-04-05 09:09:29 So a report on "Child Labour & Human Rights Abuses on Farms" has launched today by Human Rights Watch. Kindly share the report @dewamavhinga. The report is said to be 105 pages . One might also want to know why the interest in tobacco & not any of the other 15 commodities?
229 2018-04-05 09:06:28 Couldn’t have tried diplomacy before screwing over hardworking Americans? 
Do you know who is going to suffer?  Did you see what happened to soybeans on the commodities market? It’s honest hardworking farmers that are gonna take the hit not rich assholes yet again.
230 2018-04-05 09:04:37 This is what happens when you start a trade war.  Producers in the US are hurt by reduced demand.  Consumers in China are hurt by higher prices for commodities including meat. Isn't there anyone in the White House who understands this stuff?

275 2018-04-05 05:05:51 Sí sabes lo que son futuros de commodities, verdad? Por lo menos si no resulta la transacción como esperabas como inversionista, al final terminas recibiendo lo que no querías (el commodity en sí). Con algo como el petro, ni eso, suponiendo que dure.

285 2018-04-05 04:02:20 Talking of commodities, you get that the futures market is an entirely separate trade schema? It's called futures because you don't sell the soybeans you have now. You sell the soybeans you plan on growing, then are responsible for filling the order when the contract matures.
286 2018-04-05 03:50:38 Now I don't deny that Trump clearly think's he's a genius, but every single property guy I talked to as a broker always told me the same thing. "I'm in property, I do not understand the stock market. I do not understand commodities. I understand property". He's a property guy.
287 2018-04-05 03:44:42 Sounds like a good year to grow corn. Commodities are a joke to place tariffs on. It’s a propaganda ploy that any sane person can see through. Trump is laughing his ass off.  Soybeans? Ok. We won’t plant any. SMDH.

299 2018-04-05 02:39:39 Lauralemke, se llama "fungibility". Hate to say it but global commodities prices will not be majorly impacted by Trump's tarrifs. While tariffs are never ideal, neither is the asymmetric economic warfare that China has been openly engaged in for decades.

307 2018-04-05 01:28:04 The Government should offer the farmers and other companies hurt in a support payment. First of all they should buy all the grains that the farmers lost in sales & then covert it to fuel. Hogs farmers the same. Shame on the Government. #Agriculture #Commodities #Grains #Hogs
308 2018-04-05 01:23:57 Soybeans are only one commodity traded..try suggesting another couple of hundred agricultural commodities that could replace the value of soybean exports & alleviate the pressure on America’s trade deficit, but that would probably be beyond your mental capacity....
309 2018-04-05 01:11:24 How about we stop importing those same commodities and start utilizing what we have here.  Buy local
310 2018-04-05 01:07:04 Agreed! Let's bring these jobs BACK to this country.  Even if cost for commodities rise I'd rather buy American then support slave labor from countries with no conservation standards.

323 2018-04-05 00:06:17 Don’t you hate people that massage numbers in order to sell their product? Hate, fear, and distrust are commodities that need a tariff put on them. We already have plenty.
324 2018-04-05 00:03:08 I think Trump & his rich supporters like the volatility in the stock market he is (intentionally?) causing. Buy when the market drops, sell when it inevitably goes back up. They can afford the risk & commissions on large blocks of stock & commodities.
