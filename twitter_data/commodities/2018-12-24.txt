1 2018-12-24 23:42:21 Economically, commodities all compete on price not value (perceived benefit that justifies a higher price). So, if a standardized report is a means of competing in price only, then it contributes to a commodity.

41 2018-12-24 20:56:09 Ok. But you still cannot explain what intrinsic value a crypto has. There is none but you won't admit it. Hypothetical situation: emp hits computer networks crash and go dark.

42 2018-12-24 20:48:27 More than just one rate increase is the issue of whether the Fed thinks we are dealing with #inflation or #deflation Their mandate is to promote price stability......prices are collapsing for oil and all other industrial commodities and long treas rates have been falling 4 months

47 2018-12-24 20:21:02 Yes, I am literate. I also know that he didn't vote for the confirmation of John Kelly as Homeland Security Secretary or for the Commodities Futures Modernization Act to deregulate wall street. Like Bernie.
48 2018-12-24 20:18:07 Jajajajaja. El PBI aumenta por el precio de los commodities y lo festeja como propio. Ahora estos últimos años crece por gasto público más que nada. O sea sin base. Feliz navidad, y feliz año.
49 2018-12-24 20:15:50 Dollar strength is a further drag on global trade and unavoidable impact from misguided Fed policy aimed at phantom #Inflation  Accelerates the deflationary price collapse of industrial commodities.  Once this starts it is hard to stop
50 2018-12-24 20:14:02 So Saudi Arabia is going to strip mine Syria for all of its precious commodities while enslaving it peoples. Got it, so you pulled out of Syria’s nation so your friends could take it over and reap the benefits. Got it!!

60 2018-12-24 19:19:33 Socialism is just governmental capitalism. In capitalism, people get to make a living by trading commodities for money. In socialism, the government and a few selected companies get rich by taxing the people for their basic need.
61 2018-12-24 19:08:24 2018 was a good year for investing. As long as you didnt own any bitcoin, altcoins, gold, silver, amaya shares, tech stocks, domestic stocks, international stocks, or any commodities or securities.

Basically the keep all your money in cash under your mattress strategy did great.

63 2018-12-24 19:05:15 Of course, we'd know a lot more about it if the chemical cocktail used in fracking were made public.  We know that it costs $ to turn gas into LNG and store it.

70 2018-12-24 18:45:37 yes you did this after opposing GST tooth and nail over the 10 yrs of INC govt. And then you gave this nation an overly complicated tax regime. Why were the taxes high on those commodities in the first place?

73 2018-12-24 18:39:22 To give more power to the #gold rally, since Oct 2018 there have been strong money flows moving from risk assets (#equities, #commodities, EM, high yield, etc) into gold and other traditional safe haven.

77 2018-12-24 18:33:34 Look at em in usd terms. But you are right. EM sold off a lot while other markets, US in particular has been holding up well until recently. As commodities will stabilize within the next 30 days, expect EM to do well.

82 2018-12-24 18:00:50 What are we actually celebrating? When we celebrate Easter d death of Jesus and Christmas the birth of Jesus, a lot of immorality practises is done and prices of commodities hiked than any other day. Is it not supposed to be a time of reflection, charity and repentance?

87 2018-12-24 17:56:37 The biggest scam in history is banks endlessly printing and loaning out monopoly money so they can repossess homes, autos & buy tangible commodities with it. It's gotten even worse now that banks pay you virtually nothing in interest to borrow your money to get even richer.

92 2018-12-24 17:21:53 So, just to point out what I look at in order to protect the ranch.

A few months ago I felt this market turmoil turn a bit ugly. I invested in tangible silver and started mining boxes of coin for free silver.

When the market is in turmoil, tangible commodities.

101 2018-12-24 16:35:55 it is all connected - preservation of value - it is irrelevant whether the $$$ is tied up in real estate, bonds, stock, commodities, etc... if you have to convert everything to cash, you need to preserve that figure.
102 2018-12-24 16:30:01 Up to $1.2 billion-worth of impacted commodities will be distributed through nutrition assistance programs as part of the @USDA trade mitigation program. For the nearly 360,000 Iowans who struggle with food insecurity, this will make a meaningful impact.

104 2018-12-24 16:24:32 With the same malice as "shut up and get to the back of the bus" they are treating these men as thoughtless commodities for their own betterment and that's it
105 2018-12-24 16:24:16 and nurses ,security sector and the rest of civil servants what will they also say? remember tbe money these pple want is not outstanding earnings but a increment for every month. and wat are the effects on commodities prices if salaries increase?

@ncdex @FinMinIndia Pl ban the future trading of agri commodities. Exchange has nil volume in many items. Failed to help farmers n miller's in any way. Just a casino which India can't afford. @Devinder_Sharma

Commodities. P/E shrinks in bull season! Waxes when down!
225 2018-12-24 07:25:21 #RT @BJP4India: RT @arunjaitley: The Congress legacy of indirect tax was a 31% tax.  We transiently put them in the 28% slab.  As the revenues kept increasing, we started bringing down the rates.  Most of the commodities have seen tax reduced.

228 2018-12-24 06:53:24 If #DXY has peaked, one of the many commodities likely to benefit in the short-term is #WTI. I expect Oil to rally with stocks. We've tagged key support in 45s here, now going higher?
229 2018-12-24 06:43:21 sell off in PM to cover margin calls, deflationary bust is a bitch…,then buy gold, commodities for the stagflation phase after last attempt at QE if congress will allow it (expect WH and GOP will very out of favor by then plus Mueller chaos effects)
230 2018-12-24 06:37:41 Tell that to a public school teacher. Markets are notoriously poor at valuing many occupations and commodities
231 2018-12-24 06:26:04 Of the 1216 commodities which are used, broadly 183 are taxed at zero rate, 308 at 5%, 178 at 12% and 517 at 18%: Finance Ministry
232 2018-12-24 06:24:52 Mara you girls think you are commodities neh? 
233 2018-12-24 06:24:03 2/ in 08 most commodities saw huge inflows. I doubt oil will see that again because we've moved beyond peak oil. That means foodstuffs likely won't be impacted much either as ethanol is less important. But gold and silver seem cheap despite increased cost of carry.
234 2018-12-24 06:23:00 That is for Nigerians who can afford those commodities.
235 2018-12-24 06:22:38 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
236 2018-12-24 06:17:20 Sir, is distinguishing commodities like movie tickets on the basis of price a simplification? This seems to only be a ‘Value added tax’
237 2018-12-24 06:12:48 The Congress legacy of indirect tax was a 31% tax.  We transiently put them in the 28% slab.  As the revenues kept increasing, we started bringing down the rates.  Most of the commodities have seen tax reduced.
238 2018-12-24 06:06:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
239 2018-12-24 05:37:00 So by making everyone poor and not able to afford luxury is now an achievement. Why didnt you talk about the cost of commodities then compared with  now? Only achievement I see around me is poverty capital of the world. It's Christmas eve yet all is quiet.
240 2018-12-24 05:34:30 He may know or have someone who knows the meaning of breaking 2540 on the S&P and may be starting to worry about falling asset prices (not just equities but commodities as well)
241 2018-12-24 05:32:49 Queuing for commodities
242 2018-12-24 05:25:52 Oil prices rose more than 1 percent today on signs that the recent price plunge may start crimping supply from the U.S.

243 2018-12-24 05:22:24 Well, i think UNDER capitalism, more competition in commodities helps. But that's no different than saying blood-clotting helps bleeding.
244 2018-12-24 05:20:47 Lrt and wait till you hear what jesus would have thought about capitalism and the celebration of his birthday being about commodities
245 2018-12-24 05:10:08 With due respect doctor, it wasn't rumour at all. I kept quiet because I didn't want to share details. Obviously, others have and now it is out. I never speculate, even on commodities that is my favourite.
246 2018-12-24 05:07:26 Yes, they’ve been lending USD to EM’s for commodities; the more the Fed sucks on the straw of the milkshake, the more commodities they drive into China’s hands.
247 2018-12-24 05:01:06 Fun fact, when you exclude Marx and all other forms of critique of capitalism from education and media it leads to class warfare, monopolies, tent cities, catastrophic economic downturns and dangerous workspaces/commodities/living conditions.
248 2018-12-24 05:00:01 Commodities: Natural gas +3.77%, Rice +1.85%
249 2018-12-24 04:40:24 Mr President we need a lasting solution to our perils. Tanzwa nekunzi be patient. its been a year, some have died some have gone out of the country we are yet to afford basic commodities. We news ZANU to go asap pliz itai plan President.
250 2018-12-24 04:39:37 commodities are telling you if you are paying attention
251 2018-12-24 04:26:38 Why isn't the distribution of ALL subsidized commodities not controlled by the center? Why are Gehlot's kin not in jail yet? Are they in recovery / replenishment mode for self and the Congress coffers?
252 2018-12-24 04:16:46 Not true, healthcare is highly regulated right now. Food is inelastic, just like many other commodities that competition adjusts. The FDA alone prevents new medical devices, drugs, and procedures from entering into competition against the big companies already in charge.
253 2018-12-24 04:16:43 Starting to look a lot like 2016. Dollar up, gold up, then the dollar caves and #commodities go gangbuster. If we do crash at this point, commodities likely to go down and/or remain flat, but #gold gets a bid no matter what.
254 2018-12-24 04:03:20 The stock market is a symptom of the real issues which are all related to the opposite of inflation.  OiI & other commodities, not to mention the long end of the yield curve are in unison that the fed should be treating the patient for deflation, another form of price instability
255 2018-12-24 03:57:29 you could as well explore other markets like currency/commodities if equities options are not keeping your hands full :-) ..or may be switch headquarters and trade US markets directly...
256 2018-12-24 03:54:43 commodities have got me fucked up
257 2018-12-24 03:22:32 Rare commodities are worth more than good.

260 2018-12-24 03:00:50 2 / If the monetary aggregates were really growing commodities would not be collapsing across the globe. I,m amazed at how myopic the #fed is with regard to their role in Global central banking
261 2018-12-24 02:59:50 The economic problem of Nigeria has never majorly been tax - it's about basic economics ( fuel price/ prices of commodities / forex etc)
Then Security which largely depends on education, health, decent living & economic well-being of the masses.

263 2018-12-24 02:43:48 Great..

I will also meet 5 new ppl from next week and inform them about Govt's hypocrisy and prices of what all commodities has been increased from 2014...I will also make them aware about what the Modi government promised and what they delivered 
264 2018-12-24 02:42:34 Peoples power n in Sudan and Egypt are not the kind of African you mess with the.prices of food and basic commodities and u expect to live in Peace.Bread and Wheat are always n the dinner table and for whatever reason u can mess with it
265 2018-12-24 02:23:10 Either you’re joking or your scenario is standard 1st world arrogance. Brazil has its own aircraft manufacturing industry. It’s a major industrial power. Oil & gas are commodities & have a world price + Venezuela has serious forex issues.
266 2018-12-24 02:10:53 Por ciudades como Pergamino, el país necesita de políticas económicamente inclusivas y liberales. 
Somos exportadores de commodities! Cuando van a entender?
267 2018-12-24 02:09:07 Chor Rahul Gandhi ke muh pe bahut bada tamacha by reducing GST tax on essential commodities.
268 2018-12-24 02:05:51 “The fundamental business of the country, that is production and distribution of commodities, is on a sound and prosperous basis.”
269 2018-12-24 01:33:59 We likely agree that the entire Syria episode was about oil/gas and not humanitarian reasons. But you have now said that ROW is in “control” of commodities.  If they are now in “Control” of commodities & all we have is worthless paper, what is ROW waiting for in pushing us aside?
270 2018-12-24 01:32:22 They are stock and bond villains. Commodities too I bet.
271 2018-12-24 01:12:47 These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities. Same as gold or oil.
272 2018-12-24 01:10:58 Must be a systemic problem other than a 25bps increase, anyone looking at the bond market can see the fed will be blocked from moving much higher without inversion.  Collapsing asset prices is the elephant in the room, oil & indust commodities & all collateral values r falling.
273 2018-12-24 01:06:43 Marx & Engels in: The Exchange Value Hour where they discuss the exchange value of commodities at tedious length that exceeds the promised hour every single episode
274 2018-12-24 01:01:52 Evidently there is concern that major banks earnings are relying more on highly leveraged commodities trading than real property capital investments. This is a recipe for disaster as spiraling margins eventually out pace available capital & result in cascading economic collapse.
275 2018-12-24 00:46:38 Tariffs I have no problem with eaither. If it is not raising the price of commodities who is really paying more? Those with disposable income to pay.
276 2018-12-24 00:45:39 Sunday night calls corn mixed down 1, soybeans down 1 to 2 and wheat mixed. Next 2 weeks looks like the dry areas of Brazil will have needed rain , drycarea of SBrazil /Argentina to dry out. Near ideal. Holiday trade.Funds Long 128,000 corn, flat beans ,short 6000 wheat.
277 2018-12-24 00:43:56 Of course. But price increases for basic commodities and overall hardship have been a catalyst for widespread protest against the government and corruption.
278 2018-12-24 00:42:48 Of course. The point is that price rises of basic commodities and overall economic hardship are the catalyst for people coming out to protest against the government and corruption in big numbers.
279 2018-12-24 00:26:11 You’re almost correct, Farage was a commodities trader not a banker.
