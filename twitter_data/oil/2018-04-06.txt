2 2018-04-08 23:59:20 I am bearish oil & copper & have the lowest targets on the Street. I think oil falls to $10 & copper to $1.50 maybe even $1. PMs on the other hand are poised for a big rally. Lots of things are going to hurt the banking industry during the coming global bust.
3 2018-04-08 23:59:16 I thought #EnergyEast was cancelled because KeystoneXL was approved and $TRP came to terms on a deal for continuing to ship natural gas east on the pipeline that was to be converted to oil.

5 2018-04-08 23:59:01 Fair enough, but still $3bn more than clean en. Addiction to oil royalties on the east coast mjr barrier to energy transition. Oil royalties accounted for ~30% prov revenue in 2009 (down to 15ish now) - but NL just announced target of doubling oil production.
6 2018-04-08 23:58:38 Sri Lanka's inflation will increase in the next few months due to the depreciation of rupee against the US$, increase in global oil prices & a reduction in local food production. Only alternative, reduce or adjust tax/tariff on essentials & cut down government expenses #lka
7 2018-04-08 23:58:26 Crude oil, more likely. Heavy on the crude and lack of refinement, but still incendiary.
8 2018-04-08 23:58:24 I've given up. There is only so much one can do against this insanity. The systematic tear down of Alberta oil and gas industry has begun. Just sign the divorce papers.

I mean seriously 
14 2018-04-08 23:56:35 Canada can reduce greenhouse gasses to nil and it will have negligible impact on world emissions.  So I would suggest Canada's best interest is to sell as much oil as we can while we can.  If Canadian economy tanks how much will it impact your income?

The Middle Eastern scandal one spoke of earlier is the "Oil for Food" scandal through the UN.  Headed by Maurice Strong.  Exiled to China and died recently.  Media didn't cover his death.  HE was the father of "global warming".

36 2018-04-08 23:56:01 @SarahPalinUSA would have made a great Department of Energy Secretary. I knew who Sarah was well before she was a candidate for VP. She is an expert in oil drilling and environmental conservation. Who else knows? @MariaBartiromo does as well.
37 2018-04-08 23:55:56 No @AndrewScheer, #kindermorgan pipeline is only in #Alberta's interests, the rest of Canada doesn't want pipelines or dirty #TarSands oil. Canada needs to move to adopt #greenenergy and I support #CarbonTax and #CarbonPricing. #cdnpoli #bcpoli #abpoli #StopKM #ProtecttheInlet
38 2018-04-08 23:55:48 OK senators still support Pruitt, since the 3 work for the  oil & gas industry and Koch Brothers. Lankford just said "Most Oklahoman's would understand Pruitt staying in the condo of a oil/gas  lobbyist", since they're just old friends. Sad! @NorahODonnell @CBSThisMorning

43 2018-04-08 23:54:34 Happy to say my VI riding did not help elect @jjhorgan & his crew. Alta should cut off the oil taps to the Lower Mainland so the latte-sipping hipsters who vote @bcndp & @BCGreens have something to consider when they gas-up their BMW Z4s.
44 2018-04-08 23:54:25 One word .... Oil.

I'll be glad when the world runs out of oil and gas.  Maybe then we will have some semblance of peace.  It won't be in my lifetime though.
45 2018-04-08 23:54:22 What if the French had bombed the Soviet Union’s oil fields to prevent them from being used by the Germans, as was suggested by the then president of France who’s name escapes me at the moment.

1.companies no longer have to disclose pymts made to foreign gov. involv. gas/oil
2. mining com. have fewer regulation on waste mgmt.
3. People with mental issues can more easily purchase a gun.

55 2018-04-08 23:53:07 Ooh, my. Do you think we're lucky enough to get oil? With the little flecks of rosemary, too. Well, now if we don't get that, I'll be disappointed.
56 2018-04-08 23:53:05 Another relatable Alex moment: that natural peanut butter is really weird for having that oil on top. #BobsBurgers @BobsBurgersFOX
57 2018-04-08 23:52:58 It's a very poor country as far as the people goes. And he do it so he will not have to protect them and save billions in supplies to the people. He only want his country to be production of oil and natural gas and his own military and Russia and that's it. It all about money
58 2018-04-08 23:52:55 Good question.  Auto industry has already implemented process, why roll it back?  Who is complaining that they are losing money on the fuel emissions? Oil company's?
59 2018-04-08 23:52:25 Liberals are anti oil from Alberta. Full stop. Trudeau governments are awful for national unity.
60 2018-04-08 23:52:14 i was hungover as shit at work and had to pretend i just had motion sickness all day RIP we were on a retreat so this woman literally massaged my pressure points and gave me ginger essential oil they tried so hard but unfortunately i am just a dumbass who doesnt know her limits

62 2018-04-08 23:51:59 An oil company stopping its investments in a project, after years of determined yet peaceful protesting, is and should be EMPOWERING.
63 2018-04-08 23:51:56 My take is : most independent shale drillers may max their productions in eagle ford to meet their Q1 production target while increasing their DUC IN Permian to meet Q2 production target. If the oil price keeps going up, their timing will be perfect to max their profits.
64 2018-04-08 23:51:54 Clearly ignorant policies to protect their oil and gas donors.
65 2018-04-08 23:51:52 Fresh basil ice cream with lemon olive oil drizzle. It shouldn't work but it does.
66 2018-04-08 23:51:48 We've always been well above the national average for gas, having it raised even higher is ludicrous especially when oil prices are still at historic lows

100 2018-04-08 23:47:43 @realDonaldTrump Every day Scott Pruitt demeans himself and Trump. The EPA can be led by someone else who is not so embarrassing. Besides, Pruitt will get an oil or gas industry position with huge salary.
101 2018-04-08 23:47:43 Please pull your head out of your backside Abril, it’s obviously clouding your vision. I hope you’re preparing for a very different world. While the rest of the world enjoys the benefit of fossil fuels we’ll be struggling to pay the rent after paying for Saudi oil.
102 2018-04-08 23:47:40 Haha oh yeah I went right in, tasted like soap, the lavender oil is a bit too heavy 
103 2018-04-08 23:47:35 So I bought my mom this body oil, omg it’s so good I need one for myself
104 2018-04-08 23:47:08 Why is it that every single oil leak is "larger than first reported?"
105 2018-04-08 23:47:04 You and putin enjoy your dirty oil and me and rest of the world will move on leaving you and your buddy putin behind...
106 2018-04-08 23:47:03 Give it a rest. Oil is cheap and no one wants our dirty tar slurry crap
107 2018-04-08 23:47:02 I think so. And this seems like one of those places that'd be fancy enough to have the oil instead of just butter. [She laughs quietly.]

111 2018-04-08 23:46:29 29) Obama's going to confiscate your IRA, 30) he caused the BP oil spill, 31) he was behind the Aurora Massacre, 32) Michelle lost her license to practice law, 33) Obama caused Hurricane Sandy by using a Pentagon weather modification project.
112 2018-04-08 23:46:04 Condition before you wash. Hardcore....start with olive oil. Add lavender drops or whatever oil they prefer for scent preference for they all work. Wash with J & J it's the most gentle & dot... You palms with an organic oil light scent & "Gently" couif.
113 2018-04-08 23:45:55 I have some salmon and I don't know what to do with it that the kids will eat help.  

(They like it when I just sauté tilapia in olive oil or butter, but the last time I tried that with salmon, they didn't like it, and I don't know why.)
114 2018-04-08 23:45:50 Turn the taps off, stop any domestic shipments of oil and fuel into BC.
115 2018-04-08 23:45:49 Turkey wants the Northern oil field, those pesky #Kurds keep getting in his way, and Israel wants the Golan Heights oil fields and Assad keeps getting in their way...

Simple solution...

Clean Energy, no more oil...

Too bad Dems are doing the Drill Baby Drill dance with Palin
116 2018-04-08 23:45:47 Prices should not have gone up yet.  Tarrifs are announced but not implemented.  Now if they are raising prices now to cover tariffs that is a possibility.  Much like gas prices go up when the price of oil 60 days from now will be higher.
117 2018-04-08 23:45:35 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW

121 2018-04-08 23:44:18 I'm happy for all the snakes that won't be turned into oil now
122 2018-04-08 23:44:16 If you think that's crazy, consider GDP. Oil spills and car accidents improve GDP figures. The goods and services to fix the emergency count, lives lost and environmental damage don't. The company is merely demonstrating how GDP works.
123 2018-04-08 23:44:15 Shut down all oil to BC. If they want to see what it is like, then best they find out what it is like. No matter how much they whine and and cry, don't turn it back on either.
124 2018-04-08 23:44:12 Dave,Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings.Pls tell @CalgaryPride @YEGPride why you have not supported pipelines and have not gone to Vancouver to fight for AB. @kenthehr

137 2018-04-08 23:42:36 Bahrain just discovered enough oil to fill 80 billion barrels. Might have something to do with the Kinder Morgan decision. 

And Kinder Morgan failed to adequately consult all the First Nations whose land the pipeline traverses.

139 2018-04-08 23:42:05 First figures that came to hand: 1975 is a good proxy, as that’s when the post-war consensus ended (post-Nixon delinking the dollar from Au & the start of oil crises induced inflation). High water mark of unemployment was ‘84, shortly after disaster of Maggie’s monetarism lunacy.
140 2018-04-08 23:41:54 I disagree. Having tried both, I can tell you cannabis oil is a healing medicine and methamphetamine is poison which leads first to addiction and insanity and then to death, but not before causing stupid posts like yours.
141 2018-04-08 23:41:39 Knp xleh kata apa bila GST ni cukai kan org miskin? hello kak before nak compare with Saudi, berapa oil subsidy sana? Sedar tak Najib tarik subsidy pastu siap tambah lagi GST

143 2018-04-08 23:41:22 Huh. apparently some is non vegan bc fish oil or gelatin
144 2018-04-08 23:41:19 Anything "Graham" is code for "I take money from little old ladies and poor people because they think if they do I will get them into heaven"  This guy is second generation snake oil salesman.  Please Franklin, pray for the rapture to come soon... but pack for warm weather!
145 2018-04-08 23:41:11 Not from the very beginning. My grandparents were homesteaders in the early 1900s before Rail in AB. Agriculture was big for 30-40yrs...then oil began
146 2018-04-08 23:40:54 my neighbor literally stole a quart of motor oil from me how’s your weekend going
147 2018-04-08 23:40:47 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!

153 2018-04-08 23:39:08 Was feeling very adult and healthy with all these vegetables I was going to make for dinner but I don’t have olive oil so I guess cheese and fig newtons it is.

155 2018-04-08 23:38:58 @DeptofDefense @StateDept @DHSgov IMO the key issue is the 1.500 sunni wahabbi Army of Islam fighters still in Douma area trying to escape to Turkey,EU,Africa, @NATO targets. They must be stop. Why some in Congress never focus on sunni Jihad fighters ? Oil sheiks donations ?

157 2018-04-08 23:38:53 Next time Trudeau is in Alberta I wouldn't be surprised if he has an oil field accident while visiting the patch. He has done so much damage to it.
158 2018-04-08 23:38:53 Just awful. How many more Canadians are going to lose their jobs over this?? Oil transports wine, food, people, makes medical supplies, generates electricity, heats homes. Does BC really think they need none of that?  #appalling #ignorance #sad
159 2018-04-08 23:38:52 All I wanted to do was sew a dress and 3 hours later I’m covered in motor oil and tangled threads
160 2018-04-08 23:38:31 Make yourself happen Oga. This administration came in when oil was 45Dollar per barrel as against over 100Dollor during GEJ. Look at our foreign reserve! Contractors r being paid! Abandoned projects of 8-16yrs r been completed. TSA has come and block many looting leakages.
161 2018-04-08 23:38:25 Try olive oil, or baby oil
162 2018-04-08 23:38:17 Let’s stay out of the Middle East! That area os a basket case that fights amongst itself! we don’t need their oil anymore and Israel can look after itself
163 2018-04-08 23:37:56 As soon as these advanced MSR using Thehron  can be maintain cheaply enough to compete with coal.. watch it the days of fossil fuels  are over ( yahoo ) The U S can be free of gas oil and coal forever and safely so 

So you thought you had me ? Not by a long shot .fkmkenya
164 2018-04-08 23:37:48 Std. meaningless oil co talking points, despite the utterly dismal records around the world, but let's not ignore the community damage to Indigenous ppls around the world either... brutal 'security' teams that murder w/impunity & transient workers that rape & murder too.
165 2018-04-08 23:37:48 ずぬーの時間になると「ずぬー」ってツイートするお母さん可愛いですよね( ´∀｀ )
166 2018-04-08 23:37:43 Exactly, we are a HAVE province & our economy is based on many other industries that an oil spill would destroy.
167 2018-04-08 23:37:18 Today is not a victory. It's a request from #KinderMorgan for Ottawa to do its dirty work. The statement by oil minister Jim Carr suggests they are willing to play.

All pressure must be on @jjhorgan now not to back down.

170 2018-04-08 23:36:35 Before you repeat inane assertions, please explain how BC was blocking anything.  They've only indicated that they want a better assessment of what happens to dilbit in the ocean.  Seems like a fair request considering the # of major oil spills recently.
171 2018-04-08 23:36:28 ずぬー笑っちゃいました
172 2018-04-08 23:36:26 Ok, I’m trying tofu. Extra firm, pressed, and sauteed in coconut oil and spices for a while, now added to a Thai curry with loads of fresh veggies. I love to cook now that I ditched meat! #plantbased #eatyourveggies #meatless #dairyfree #crueltyfree
173 2018-04-08 23:36:24 I usually cook it in water tbh then add butter 
Never used oil wth
174 2018-04-08 23:36:20 Seeing plenty of digging out here with oil drilling. Doing some horizontal but plenty of vertical drilling. 
175 2018-04-08 23:36:14 Love coconut oil cook with it, bath with it, moisturize my hair with it.  Also known to eat a teaspoonful now and then. Avocado on everything. Hemp hearts super seeds YUMM
176 2018-04-08 23:36:09 Eh. What does she care if there's an oil leak in her home state? She's Hollywood now.
177 2018-04-08 23:36:02 Doomed oil?  oil consumption is increasing every year. The USA has ramped up  oil exports, using our cheap oil as a supplement. Their LNG business is up, they built 10,000 mies of oil pipe while Canada played dead for the enviro-crazies.  NFLD is doubling its oil Biz... CDN fools
178 2018-04-08 23:35:50 I probably look like some grimy, unwashed humbum to a lot of these folks, but they don't know I bath 2x a day and put coconut oil in my hair and rosemary and cedar in my beard lmao
179 2018-04-08 23:35:47 Not a car, only one RANDON 5 LITERS OF MOTOR OIL
180 2018-04-08 23:35:39 I once got carded buying olive oil. 
181 2018-04-08 23:35:31 Have they used groundnut oil as cream before?
Have they done soak and travel before?
I've used #50 to cook rice before. I bought rice inside
182 2018-04-08 23:35:23 Looks stunning. Also always loved baby kid, same cooking format, served with simple but delicious salad of toms, onions, crunchy lettuce, sea salt and lashings of olive oil all washed down with a stonking Ribera del Duero. Same region obvs: Maybe a summer alternate?
183 2018-04-08 23:35:17 I could’ve been doing homework  but instead I chose to go on a futile search for olive oil cake and now I’m both behind on work and cake-less
184 2018-04-08 23:35:15 We don't let private companies own roadways. Why don't we build the pipeline ourselves and lease access to it to oil companies? Cut a deal with BC for the revenues, have them pitch in to help build it. Can't imagine they'll reject a profitable proposal.
185 2018-04-08 23:35:04 Buy oregano oil!! That’ll literally dry it right off your face
186 2018-04-08 23:34:59 She is also threatening to take away natural gas for home heating and have you noticed the gas prices lately.  They are going up again.  So .63 cents a barrel for oil and in some parts of Ont. the price is $1.40 per litre (3.7 gal in a litre) and the rest is tax.
187 2018-04-08 23:34:48 Annnd...someone set off the building fire alarm for the one right next to us. People! Learn how to cook, would you please? Or if not, stop using oil to deep fry stuff. Some of us can't deal with alarms all the flippin' time. 
188 2018-04-08 23:34:36 (Rub some alcohol & tea tree oil on that hoe)
189 2018-04-08 23:34:22 Honestly, figuring out the dosage that works best for you is the place to start...next is consistently taking it, with the oil I sell you figure out your dose and take it twice a day, hope this helps!
190 2018-04-08 23:34:19 For anyone out there who deals with chronic pain, I highly suggest talking a hot bath with epsom salt and a relaxing essential oil (Lavender and Orange are my fav). Every muscle in my body is so relaxed rn.
191 2018-04-08 23:34:10 Forgot to get some cooking oil so baked chicken wings it is. Don’t need any fried food anyway
192 2018-04-08 23:34:03 Day after Captain Cosplay comes west to reassure the oil and gas industry and this happens. Trudeau is a disaster for Canada, like his father before him.

194 2018-04-08 23:34:01 Advice: if your other half s snoring due to a cold, DO NOT put soothing oil on pillow then rub eye!!!!  I would cry but it hurts SO much
195 2018-04-08 23:33:49 I fully support pipelines as the safer and more efficient method of moving oil instead of rail.

That said, its 100% upto the pipeline co, and alberta govt to get the stakeholders onside. BC, FN, other communities - they have to get them to buy in. They didnt.
196 2018-04-08 23:33:38 The Trans Mountain failure has shown serious lack of political calculation on Trudeau’s part. Oil addicted Alberta and money addicted Ontario will blame him, and he’s already lost B.C. for turning his back on us at the start. Lose lose.

198 2018-04-08 23:33:35 Rachel, get off your hands. Be the leader Alberta needs at this critical moment. Bring the Countries leaders together by stopping the flow of oil West and East. Do not leave this to the courts. Time is of the essence!
199 2018-04-08 23:33:26 Dear America,
Just because your bathrooms have scented oil plug ins doesn’t mean that they’re clean.

200 2018-04-08 23:32:45 People dressed in theif Sunday best to attend a lynching of a boy, soaked in oil, who’d been convicted of a crime after only an hour trial. This wasn’t done by the Klan, but a mob of unmasked community members. #americanhistory #blackhistory #americanshame @60Minutes
201 2018-04-08 23:32:45 How is it that Alberta speaks for all Cdns @jkenney?? They are the oil patch, how do u think they speak for the country on carbon emissions?? @ctvqp @EvanLSolomon
202 2018-04-08 23:32:43 And if you're gonna come at me about being liberal or "the liberal media", yes, we have Sean Hannities too. And her name is Nancy fucking Grace. The thing is, I can easily admit there are snake oil opinion sellers on both sides. Can you?
203 2018-04-08 23:32:39 If it’s bacterial or viral, I highly recommend a drop or two of oregano oil in water or tea; if stomach bug etc, a couple of charcoal tablets should knock it out
204 2018-04-08 23:32:32 American governments going to war in other countries for oil etc. they wish people dead and killed many many innocent people in doing so.
205 2018-04-08 23:32:30 Kenney asked why he's bringing up the past when he's demonstrated against abortion and gay rights in the past. He says the demonstrations against oil sands by NDP backbenchers was way more recent. #ableg
206 2018-04-08 23:32:25 Y'all need to fight for that oil as a nation esp the youth, advocate for that!!! Your future is near

208 2018-04-08 23:32:01 you enjoying the weekend first the great win over the oil merchants now the wrestlemania life is good, except I have to get up in the morning haha
209 2018-04-08 23:31:35 He has attended close doored meetings with industry boards. For example, in May of last year, he met with the Portland Cement Association, the Large Public Power Council, American Iron and Steel, the American Exploration and Production Council, and the US Oil and Gas Association
210 2018-04-08 23:31:32 Ok, let's do a hypothetical. Alberta becomes it's own nation. Explain how oil gets to tide water in that case?
211 2018-04-08 23:31:20 IMF wrote a white paper in 2011 under DSK discussing pricing "commodities like oil and gold in SDR's".  In a bit of bad luck, 3 mths later DSK was arrested in the US on assault charges and later ceased being head of IMF.
212 2018-04-08 23:31:11 15,000 white Americans watched Jesse Washington lynched in Waco, Texas. He was lynched, drenched in oil and burned. This was after a jury convicted of murder after one hour. @Oprah @60Minutes. This speaks to the historical trauma of Black America.
213 2018-04-08 23:31:07 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or Libya.
214 2018-04-08 23:30:37 So you’ll invest taxpayer $ in the doomed oil industry but not use those same $ to retrain oil workers and invest in green energy?  Not smart - don’t blame BC for Alberta’s stunted economic strategy.
215 2018-04-08 23:30:34 おはよう
216 2018-04-08 23:30:24 Was it the coconut oil enema? Or the vegeane diets people recommended?!
217 2018-04-08 23:30:21 I substituted things that were in the recipe I didn't have on hand. Instead of honey I used sugar. Instead of the oil I used vegetable oil.  But hubby said it came out good.  A Sunday cooking is a good Sunday for me. Not done yet, chicken parmesian is dinner tonight..
218 2018-04-08 23:30:17 Modeling. *smirks, grabbing a bottle of oil and smoothing it over Marik’s back* Pornography. We’d make a fortune.
219 2018-04-08 23:30:14 Smart investors should take that statement as cue to starting loading up on heavy oil producers. Catalyst is right there on the horizon.
220 2018-04-08 23:30:06 Looks like really  cheap wholesale oil to me! With free delivery
221 2018-04-08 23:29:51 Ive done this with coconut oil and its the worst

228 2018-04-08 23:28:55 so i'm working on this cobb salad, made the dressing for it and will cook the chicken/corn once the chicken is thawed. got the garlic oil resting. making meatloaf and a veggie tomorrow. getting back on that meal prep sort of.
229 2018-04-08 23:28:54 I take 5 mg of melatonin and turn on a diffuser with lavender oil in it about 1 hour before I plan on going to bed
230 2018-04-08 23:28:43 Makes sense. A bit of time with a mallet and penetrating oil may free that up.
231 2018-04-08 23:28:36 Obama/Trump Syria policy: "Make me an omelette. but don't break any eggs, don't scramble the eggs & don't use no oil, don't turn on the fire. make someone else pay for it."
#JustSayin
232 2018-04-08 23:28:28 Well do something about it.  For Christ’s sake.  Tweeting I’m sure won’t get oil to tide water.
233 2018-04-08 23:28:27 Ezra I'm surprised.....It has seemed quite obvious for some time now that Trudeau and Notley want to make ALL oil and gas Crown Corporations. The only way to do that is to have almost every company pull out and leave - allowing them to "come to the rescue".
234 2018-04-08 23:28:26 I have a legit one and then the way I made it this time. Basically:

Half spaghetti squash & oil/salt/pepper it up, place it cut side down and bake for an hour. Let cool then shred up innards (toss seeds)

Mix "spaghetti" shreds with salt and parmesan cheese. Layer in a pan (1/?)
235 2018-04-08 23:28:06 Alhamdulillah
236 2018-04-08 23:27:48 Why can’t Alberta build a refinery in Edmonton or Ft McMurray.or even Redwater, then BC wouldn’t have the risk of a major oil spill in the gulf

If Iran's Mullah's are toppled heading into this summer (April???) CL to provide a spike high reversal? Longer term suggests we're topping and headed into the teens.
240 2018-04-08 23:27:31 I want more than anything that we should endeavor to end war. It is a rich man's game and it uses our blood to oil the gears of it's machine. I am tired of seeing coffins draped with our colors. But how to end the rich man's game? Their want of more money is insatiable.
241 2018-04-08 23:27:27 1) Jesus didnt exist. 2) They are dying for cheap oil.
242 2018-04-08 23:27:20 absolutelyyy. Coconut oil is also a huge blessing
243 2018-04-08 23:27:15 A keen Gardner @ChrisChittell taught me that SOIL without OIL is just SSSSSSSSSS  #emmerdalefarm without FARM is just @emmerdale @RichEllis_ @DivaRodriguez @MaxNicoll @SophieOrchard 
244 2018-04-08 23:27:12 Refer my previous replies. US, saudis, oil lobby, nuclear Israel tried once to topple Assad via Wahabi jehadis and result was IS, civil war. I predict on twitter, if regime change is tried in Syria again, expect a bigger civil war in middle east and big refugee crisis in Europe.

249 2018-04-08 23:26:51 And I know you don’t trust me with this BUT PINTEREST SAID SO SO ITS LEGIT. Use apple cider vinegar on a washcloth and thoroughly “soak” your sunburn in it, then once it’s completely dry, use organic coconut oil on it. It works wonders. And I’m a ginger. I approve.

255 2018-04-08 23:25:33 Try it. Roast a chicken with onion, garlic & mixed herbs. Mix some flour thickener with cold water, add couple of teaspoons adjika, dollop of sour cream & dash of salt & sugar, then make sauce in pan adding chicken meat, serve on rice bed w/sliced tomato+onion+oil+vinegar+s&p.

258 2018-04-08 23:25:01 Kenney says the NDP gvt here is made up of backbenchers who demonstrated against oil sands and the oil sector.  #ableg
259 2018-04-08 23:24:55 left where?
these terrorists and their family sent to #Afrin where turkey & russia backed terrorist invade here.
HALF MILLION PEOPLE , INCLUDE REFFUGIES FROM RAQQA,ALEPPO IDLIB etc have to leave their lands.russian dirty plans with  turkey dosent care syrians just pipeline,oil ..
260 2018-04-08 23:24:36 Can't stand that commercial for olive oil with the sound of a phone on vibrate. It got my attention, though.
261 2018-04-08 23:24:24 I love orangatangs! And scan food labels for palm oil on products now that I know the impact of that industry on their possible extinction. 
262 2018-04-08 23:24:10 Whether or not you have acne, it's important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin's surface. #Always #Moisturize #After
263 2018-04-08 23:24:09 Hint:.. It's hot, sandy, and has oil.. and an orb.
264 2018-04-08 23:24:04 I don't know what itvin is. The solution is to support clean, renewable energy and stop holding on to the past. Think long term. Even it costs a few bucks more. Renewable energy will be cheaper once people reject dirty oil,
265 2018-04-08 23:23:58 Ah, I see we're about to double-down on oil. Awesome.
266 2018-04-08 23:23:53 And by targeting law breakers they mean banning very expensive and rare firearms, owned by law abiding citizens.
267 2018-04-08 23:23:52 maybe the reason is quite different? can European countries need cheap oil and gas? but how to get it for free, just chaos, as it is now being done from Iraq, where Power also "found" chemical weapons. only then I apologized for making a mistake.

269 2018-04-08 23:23:45 For instance William D'Arcy helped Iran discover oil in early 20th century (south) (PRO). At the same time big concessions were made in order to extract those natural resources (CON). Russians on the other hand were just killing Persians in the north. Russia was cruel not GB
270 2018-04-08 23:23:42 I'm combo leaning more oily EXCEPT my t-zone . It took me several years to figure out my complexion type and what really worked for me.  I remember back in like 2011 I used one foundation , one concealer and set it with cover girl translucent powder and would be oil slicked later
271 2018-04-08 23:23:34 I wanna make lumpia but I just spent the last 5 days getting rid of the fried oil smell.
272 2018-04-08 23:23:29 And they nearly dropped into old div 3!! Escaped by the skin of there teeth!
Then came the oil men!
Cheers Shoubik buddy!;
273 2018-04-08 23:23:28 Depends on your nutrition/skin health/aftercare! I went coconut oil all the time topical. Fish oil and plenty of greens for nutrition. Clean and healed up quick
274 2018-04-08 23:23:21 The oil is coming to Vancouver either way .... pick you poison pipe or rail ..... love to see people blockade the railway ....... shit would get real in a hurry

276 2018-04-08 23:23:08 You can diversify if you have money to invest. The oil industry is not remotely dead and is our path to diversification. Will we be ready?
277 2018-04-08 23:22:58 cancel the carbon levy and join with Sask to challenge the Feds ability to impose one ASAP.  Launch legal proceedings agianst Greenpeace, green party, Elizabeth May & Tzeporah Berman to recover lost oil royalty revenues.  Initiate a review of conditions of separation.
278 2018-04-08 23:22:49 I pineapple it with one of those hair ties that looks like a phone cord, but flat/frizzy is still a problem :/ I wet down the frizzy bits in the morning and put a lil oil on them to try and fix it
279 2018-04-08 23:22:43 We can't "hurt" "the economy" folks. We can hurt profits. We can hurt individual businesses/sectors (which affects individuals). But an economy w universal public food, shelter, transit, school, leisure, but w/o oil cos, stock mkts, or cars wouldnt be "hurt". It would be healthy.

284 2018-04-08 23:22:00 Oxygen levels were around 94% this morning I didn't bother to point it out but I did manage to get amoxicillin changed to coamoxiclav as I knew the amoxicillin on its own would be pointless

Buying essential oil of cloves tomorrow bashing this
285 2018-04-08 23:22:00 I am pouring oil into Burrard Inlet this week to spite the province
286 2018-04-08 23:21:59 Love seeing multiple ads each day from an oil industry lobbying org, specifically stanning for E.x.x.o.n. Your media strategy is weak & nobody's opinion of the oil industry is going to become more favorable due to memes & flaky studies
287 2018-04-08 23:21:38 Always thought @TonyRobbins was just a charlatan selling snake oil at his medicine shows. Turns out he's a sexist cockwomble too.

289 2018-04-08 23:21:16 Use brown sugar and coconut oil trust me its worth it I still can't get over how my lips looks and feel
290 2018-04-08 23:20:57 Use lavender oil- it can take the sting and itch away. 
291 2018-04-08 23:20:45 I'll just stick to my oil.
292 2018-04-08 23:20:44 @fordnation needs to go to Ottawa and bitch slap Trudeau. Trudope has land-lock our oil now all of Canada is screwed.

293 2018-04-08 23:20:42 I think oil and gas cuz now that car makers have already reduced gas consumption they wouldn’t want to go back and unless they were only going to sell cars in US they’d need to have stricter controls.
294 2018-04-08 23:20:35 Get the oil out of ground in Alberta which provides jobs, and then refine that oil in Alberta and provide more jobs???? So we can use our own oil here in Canada and not worry about piping and shipping cheap crude out this country risking polluting our mountains,rivers and ocean.
295 2018-04-08 23:20:14 There is no better confidence booster than seeing your skin glistening in the sun while you have banana boat tanning oil all over your body and you smell like a snack
296 2018-04-08 23:20:09 Thought my Lush Bath oil said it came with a surprise(?) .... after it melt into the prettiest light green citrus bath it probably just meant surprise yeast infection
297 2018-04-08 23:20:06 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

301 2018-04-08 23:19:34 Its upto alberta and the oil co's to get a buy in of BC, Municipalities, and the FN who's land this crosses over.

These guys all think Alberta should be able to run roughshod over everyone else's property and land rights.

307 2018-04-08 23:18:40 Dude, I spent 35 years doing so, no one is claiming that Big oil has caused subsidence, that’s been going on since cave man invented fire, the claim is not SUBSIDENCE, please stop with the false narratives, more intellectual honesty please
308 2018-04-08 23:18:32 Oil spills is when the government won't listen. Thousands protested but the man in charge he owns part of it.
309 2018-04-08 23:18:29 Heh. Throw Arthur Dent into an oil pipeline protest. That would be hilarious. Sadly, this one I think will end up getting built and not evaporating into a whiff of ozone and carbon monoxide shortly thereafter.
310 2018-04-08 23:17:52 Hey, people who know something about this (I don’t). Is the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline decision good for the railways? Will they be moving more oil by rail (spewing diesel fumes and risking derailments in the process)? #kindermorgan #cdnpoli
311 2018-04-08 23:17:52 I Couldn't Imagine Lol, I Always Will Wash And Oil Them Then Look For Any Reason To Not Start
312 2018-04-08 23:17:50 He would never give up on such an important oil geopolitical zone. They need to clear all the shipping routes from the oil fields they have gained control over.
313 2018-04-08 23:17:46 5.) @seanhannity speaks in such a way that he's reminiscent of a used car salesman. Looking to make people feel smart by feeding them bullshit they agree with. 6.)

324 2018-04-08 23:16:03 Tarte maracuja oil is one of my fave finds! Too good
325 2018-04-08 23:16:01 So .... you’d rather keep the status quo, whereas a pipeline will reduce pollution (shipping oil by rail, car, import from other countries, etc ... )

338 2018-04-08 23:14:24 Nonsense. Assad has NOTHING to gain by gassing his own people. He's the only one who has defeated ISIS anywhere. Why don't you just admit this is all about an oil pipeline?

342 2018-04-08 23:13:52 Not sure if this is what you’re asking for, but what I do is put coco oil in my hair (roots to ends), let it sit for about 30 min, and then wash it out with shampoo and conditioner
343 2018-04-08 23:13:39 The US is fracking its shale depisits at a rapid clip and blocking oil from Alberta as environmentally unfriendly. Just a whiff of self dealing in that.
344 2018-04-08 23:13:23 They should also ask him what the oil and auto industries gave him in return?

350 2018-04-08 23:12:39 Dispicable. Canada employs over 200 thousand Canadians in oil and gas. They come from every province across Canada. Ashamed of Canadians that would be so selfish as to take their lively hood away. They don't protest the tankers do they!
351 2018-04-08 23:12:36 Wow Good for the folks in BC Made a stand and held to their values Alberta has to move past oil and find a sustainable industry that can carry them through the 21st century  Mr Trudeau should have known better than to test BC resolve
352 2018-04-08 23:12:34 This is a friendly reminder to get your oil changed

The SNATS shouted loud enough about its "oor oil."

Not once have I heard them say it's "oor fish."
356 2018-04-08 23:12:07 The thing is, they are not fooling anyone. They hate oil. They hate the pipelines. Now they’re trying to act like they are in support of it. Bullshit they got exactly what they wanted.
357 2018-04-08 23:12:04 'lack of action'?? Hell, Obama helped set up, arm, and fund the 'rebels'! This 'civil war' was setup by outsiders for $$$$$ (oil, gas pipeline).
358 2018-04-08 23:12:00 You’re really blaming Trudeau for squandering oil money?? You’re not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?

381 2018-04-08 23:09:21 Alberta should do two things immediately, walk away from carbon plan by halting closure of coal fired plants and stop collecting carbon tax and as well shuttting down the oil supply to Vancouver
382 2018-04-08 23:09:17 It started as a means to get climate change on the political agenda. That’s been accomplished. I mean the oil companies now feel victimized. Talk about punching above your weight. But this is a point where I think obsession with winning a battle potentially costs you the war.

393 2018-04-08 23:07:12 Isn’t olive oil something you cook with
394 2018-04-08 23:07:04 The only ones winning Kennedy are the US, Russian and Saudi Oil and Gas Industries. I guess your happy supporting foreign oil.
395 2018-04-08 23:07:00 This is it, Alberta has to take back their rights under the constitution to get out oil to both east and west coasts. The inaction of our provincial government and their carbon tax as well has to change. We need good strong leaders to assert our rights!
396 2018-04-08 23:06:58 BC has its own oil/gas, Alberta just uses BC land to pipe to belligham USA that produces the diesel/gas. Alberta is a little marmot compared to all of BC. Alberta also buys BC hydro to power the oil sands and uses our fresh water #calgary #bcpoli #ableg

400 2018-04-08 23:06:16 ok there is your problem. you gotta fight oil with moisture. If u feel like your skin might be oily in general, you can pick up an oil free face lotion from the cosmetics section and apply it morn/night after each face wash.

425 2018-04-08 23:02:57 One pipeline is not "endlessly" and the recent economic recovery isn't shared by all. Innovation has improved outlook for oil co's, not oil workers.
426 2018-04-08 23:02:54 I doubt that Alberta investing in the Trans Mountain pipeline will diminish the opposition? Hmmm. Are we getting to a point where the Canadian oil and gas industry is only be viable if it's nationalized? Shades of the National Energy Program.

442 2018-04-08 23:00:42 Once I accidentally heated a glass bottle of olive oil along with some boiling water. I grab the olive oil, burn my hand, and throw it down... into the boiling water. I looked like a fucking zebra for 2 months.

470 2018-04-08 22:57:09 There's no clear path that I've seen that ends the oil industry. Why should Alberta suffer? Why should Canada? Renewable energy cannot support the energy demands of the worldright now; until it can, we need oil. Alberta & Canada have oil to sell. You want a nationalized pipeline?

477 2018-04-08 22:56:07 It is unfortunately a natural process.  The other factor is the faults along the gulf coast that also contribute.  Sad to see it blamed on oil and gas when it has been a mutual relationship for many years.

483 2018-04-08 22:55:25 Where's Trudeau in the #KinderMorgan dispute? Not standing up for Alberta and Canada. Time to shut down oil to BC refineries. This isn't a country any more. Liberals just suck up to the greens. #cdnpoli

488 2018-04-08 22:54:59 Realistically?  About 60/40 because it was also in the movie. Great way to judge similar tastes and tolerance. Getting the reference is one thing. Not being bothered if you don't get it is entirely another thing. Lots of snowflakes online and all.
489 2018-04-08 22:54:56 You said if your Word Lord, let death take the enemy by surprise. I send your Angels, walls of them to guard and protect Syria & Russia. Let no hurt, harm nor danger come to them. You know the lies Lord, you know the agenda, they put more importance on oil and money than life.
490 2018-04-08 22:54:55 IMHO - No doubt but that Putin has kompromat on Trump (prob PP tapes+), but I think it is a combination of that AND the promise of great riches.  e.g., a 19% interest in Rosneft - the behemoth Russian oil company.  PLUS - Trump is benefiting BIG time from selling off the USA.

496 2018-04-08 22:54:14 To say that some canals that were dug caused all of this is silly.  Even then, canals were not just dug for oil and gas, but also agriculture.  The diversion of the Mississippi River caused the delta system to mature due to lack of deposition.  That’s when they start to subside
497 2018-04-08 22:54:11 Poor oil in a pan 
498 2018-04-08 22:54:08 So you think that we should be forced to buy hybrids? Just to placate your sense of what should be?? The bitter reality for you is that virtually everything we buy is dependent on oil. Including,  ironically, the things that make ur hybrid

503 2018-04-08 22:53:02 Absolutely.  Moving that oil project to Nigeria or Venezuela where environmental standards are so much higher, is a real big win.

505 2018-04-08 22:52:38 I think that's maybe the wrong question?

506 2018-04-08 22:52:21 You are so far off base that I don’t know where to start.  The state has gone into very profitable relationships with oil companies for many years - and it has been very beneficial.  Now, years later, some people have decided that they should go after these companies.
507 2018-04-08 22:52:14 I thought the same thing. I'm a little bias I think he's just a snake oil salesman.
508 2018-04-08 22:52:09 #EIA #STEO Tuesday - expect slight pickup up in U.S. oil forecast, smaller than last month's guesstimate, much smaller than the jump shown in the prior 3 reports. 
#OPEC Monthly Thursday - slight increase non OPEC supply and global 2018 demand.

557 2018-04-08 22:47:11 @jimcarr_wpg It will NOT create jobs! Stop lying to the people. And the gas prices will RISE because of the cost of transport of the oil through the pipeline. You are a joke and a disgrace to the future of our country. You are outright ignoring science and lying to the people!
558 2018-04-08 22:46:59 Olive oil is getting expensive. But this foot therapy needs to be done. 
559 2018-04-08 22:46:54 I may be addicted to @BenissimoOils sriracha oil... but that's okay no one needs to send help. Although more sriracha oil wouldn't hurt. 
560 2018-04-08 22:46:51 Strategically Syria is very important, that's why Putin's involved. Gas/oil pipelines and strategic ports near there.
561 2018-04-08 22:46:39 Oil co’s aren’t investing in CDA because they can’t get product to market, much like the grain producers are facing. Great leadership  #ableg #cdnpoli

564 2018-04-08 22:46:20 Es así, pero cada vez es más complicado por las maquinitas. Más en commodities como el Oil...TA se usa, es interesante... Pero es adicional, siempre adicional.
565 2018-04-08 22:46:05 Maybe Alberta / Transmountain runs a pipeline North to the Arctic Ocean - I am sure the Russian's icebreaking oil tankers would be happy to transport our oil to world markets - no provincial jurisdictions to have to deal with.
566 2018-04-08 22:46:01 My hair is having a breakdown, like it is so greasy but I know it is saturated in oil at this point it can't get worse. I think.
567 2018-04-08 22:45:59 I bought all of those and I also have the Marula oil and Lala whipped cream. You get 15% off if you go to their website and provide your email. I’m pumped. I’ve been using a couple samples for a few days and my skin is already looking better! But I’ll do a review for sure!

574 2018-04-08 22:45:23 Step down. You are an obstacle in the way of our sustainable, ecological, and economical development. You are a direct cause of innocent Albertan families losing jobs & money, because you'd rather get your oil from terrorists & dictators than other Canadians.

578 2018-04-08 22:44:44 I don't understand it either. They're content to support ISIS to get rid of Assad and they've murdered so many Christians and Shi'ite Muslims out there, but the silence on that is deafening. This is about access & control of gas/oil pipelines, which Putin controls
579 2018-04-08 22:44:41 How about just a beard brush and oil? Any deals like that around?

582 2018-04-08 22:44:23 If you pour the Olive Oil in your mouth then spray it out on the meat, you limit the harmful chemicals
583 2018-04-08 22:44:19 Also, in regards to your arthritis, if you haven't already, go see an osteopath, take a look at your nutrition; are you taking things like cod liver oil to lubricate your joints? Or your other vitamins?
584 2018-04-08 22:44:15 @GlamLifeGuru can you recommend a good hair/body oil that won’t break the bank?? I was using Josie Moran Argon oil but it’s getting spendy 
585 2018-04-08 22:44:12 Seriously. I haven't even touched my oil or acrylic paints in years

598 2018-04-08 22:42:28 I don't say that to be rude or mean.  I say that because there are multiple views who support the same thing but in different ways. And so many people can't comprehend that support can come from multiple pools of reason. Even differing reasons.

601 2018-04-08 22:42:04 I owe taxes this year, double what I did a year ago. I don’t get special loopholes or exemptions like millionaires and big oil in Oklahoma. But I am glad to pay taxes because they fund key services in our state & nation. Everyone should do their part.

611 2018-04-08 22:39:13 Try baked broccoli with olive oil and some lemon pepper. Looks better. Tasted better. Is better for you. Then you can replace those cream sauce calories with something that is actually palatable.
612 2018-04-08 22:39:02 Oklahoma is the most seismically active region in the US. Bc of injecting fracking byproduct back into the ground. 100% man made earthquakes.

617 2018-04-08 22:38:17 What??...that makes ZERO sense! my info isn’t coming from the oil companies. Its coming from multiple Independant sources and both the Liberal and Conservative Federal governments...PLUS first hand information (that you obviously don’t have). It’s common knowledge!

628 2018-04-08 22:37:01 I mostly agree. Unconventional shale oil/gas is one example of how we can help indirectly. However, I think all global problems are our business because we have allies all around the world.

630 2018-04-08 22:36:40 The Gov of Canada must take action that moves this project forward. This pipeline must be built, under strict guidelines yes, but built now. Oil will be phased out but until that happens, Alberta has to sell our oil.
631 2018-04-08 22:36:40 @TroKalayjian Just for flavor you prefer olive & avocado oil or you don't think coconut oil is good to use functionally?
632 2018-04-08 22:36:39 Meanwhile Russia builds pipelines to China and tankers full of Alaska crude sail by Victoria BC on a daily basis. We missed the LNG boat and now the oil one all thanks to a vocal minority of useful idiots and the politicians and media that support them over everyday canadians.
633 2018-04-08 22:36:12 He has crossed your line many times. Get troops out soon, very soon. We have lost 7 trillion for nothing. You had their oil and you want to give it up because you have no balls and very small hands
634 2018-04-08 22:36:10 i really like teatree oil, it's kind of drying but i use it for a spot treatment on pimples, also lush ocean salt worked for me when I worked at the convention grill and was around oily food all day and had combination skin like that (except it's a lil spendy)

658 2018-04-08 22:33:51 Why don't you just come out and say that the liberal government does not support the oil industry in any way shape or form. The liberal government would rather have oil imported then getting it from Alberta. Your government is truly Anti Canadian.

681 2018-04-08 22:30:34 This is even more concerning since he was in BC and Fort Mac just last week. He met with oil sands executives but never bothered to meet with Kinder Morgan. Huge blow to the industry and Canada. @JustinTrudeau must be ok with investment $ and revenue going south
682 2018-04-08 22:30:33 By "out of oil" I mean not in the business of producing it.

685 2018-04-08 22:30:01 Might I suggest a salad with nasturtium flowers, halved cherry tomatoes, garlic+lemon+olive oil dressing, some kind of grain and shaved Parmesan/manchego . If you have any summer squash it is nice if thinly sliced and added to this mix as well

695 2018-04-08 22:28:46 Can we stop building oil pipelines? K?
696 2018-04-08 22:28:43 If anyone's curious, my hot cacao recipe: Boil one cup of water with a teaspoon of raw cacao powder, a tablespoon of coconut oil and as much coconut sugar as you want, and sprinkle in nutmeg, clove and/or cinnamon
697 2018-04-08 22:28:41 Rock festival?  Tell them you’re only interested if the outfit comes with a daisy headband, two large joints and a bottle of wine - oh and I almost forgot, some patchouli oil (or incense sticks)
698 2018-04-08 22:28:32 Get ready for bumper to bumper oil/crude train cars from Edmonton to Burnaby! The produce will get to market one way of the other. #Pipeline

700 2018-04-08 22:28:07 I think we just earned 280 million dollars. We solved what’s wrong with O&G right now. 

Here’s a bonus tip - Saudi oil being shipped into the east coast instead of them using Canadian oil, produced by Canadian tax paying companies, employees, safety standards, enviro standards

702 2018-04-08 22:27:48 A rather large percentage of Alberta oil for BC is refined at Cherry Point Washington. That is why BC pays such a high price for fuel. Everyone Cherry Point has an issue, our price goes up by $.05/litre
703 2018-04-08 22:27:47 I get them as well and find that peppermint essential oil helps alleviate some of the pain.
704 2018-04-08 22:27:40 Increasingly vitriolic partisanship and the after effects of whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment for 2 decades play a part, but I would say mostly proximity to areas that chicken Hawks consider of strategic importance, i.e. oil.
705 2018-04-08 22:27:39 Going to go soak in the bathtub with some rosemary essential oil and a hot cacao, maybe hit the peninsula later and fly a kite with my soul brother and niece
706 2018-04-08 22:27:35 My anger is for lack of humanity and decency from an animal like you! for the lack of empathy! for the lack of Tears over children blood being shed for Oil not for Freedom! not for morality for OIL! for money! you're an idiot people like you are the problem.
707 2018-04-08 22:27:35 Tony Robbins gives a teeny weeny 'oops, sorry, I didn't mean it' fart of an apology & then tries to pass off Byron Katie's 'life happens for you' as the source of his fount of wisdom. Pass on the snake oil, big dude.
708 2018-04-08 22:27:34 #TonyRobbins is a huckster/snake oil salesman, who preys on emotionally vulnerable people looking for ways to change their lives.  His "drive-thru therapy" is totally irresponsible. He's the perfect example of what happens when testosterone goes wild.
709 2018-04-08 22:27:27 According to OPEC's World Oil Outlook, oil and gas will continue to take the largest share (52% - 53%) of the world's energy needs for the next 25 years.

So we have 25 years to start the journey of diversifying our economy.

GT Bank that's charging me for Card Maintenance would soon come and tell me when they changed the engine oil for my 3 years old ATM card? 
714 2018-04-08 22:26:35 Ppl expect it to pay for everything! Can't have cheap premiums then. Nobody expects car insurance to pay for oil changes...but by golly health insurance should pay for massages, well checks and toothbrushes!
715 2018-04-08 22:26:22 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
716 2018-04-08 22:26:15 Don't forget about the oil workers that @cathmckenna is worried about going all rapey. 
That didn't help the cause.
717 2018-04-08 22:26:09 Try lavender oil on your wrist and back of your neck. That should do the trick.
718 2018-04-08 22:25:46 ..Its an interesting observation in Nehruji's own words (although he was able 2 write), tht "Prison is not a pleasant place to live in even
for a short period, much less for long years".
1 can now judge what Savarkar went through, grinding oil & peeling coconuts in Cellular Jail!
719 2018-04-08 22:25:39 okay! for oily skin, a matte foundation is best and all skin types need to moisturize! there are oil control foundations specifically for oily skin
720 2018-04-08 22:25:33 Nothing to do with AssadThis us about gas and oil
721 2018-04-08 22:25:32 So I guess Canada doesn't need the oil and gas revenue, because the budget will balance itself. Trudumb is an idiot.
722 2018-04-08 22:25:24 So your real happy with the extra millions of gallons of oil polluting south dakota land because of his deletingvpipe line enviromental regs?? You are NOT helping Soyh Dakotam you will be Voted out!!!
723 2018-04-08 22:25:13 If #TransMountain isn’t built, wouldn’t oil by rail shipments increase even more???

724 2018-04-08 22:25:11 Of course Rounds wpuld say this, his own state is outlawing free speech, protest, peaceful assembly. In other words working for the oil industry.

728 2018-04-08 22:25:06 Coconut oil is ok but my question is "Is fresh coconut meat ok to eat?" Or is it too high carbs?
729 2018-04-08 22:25:05 I have never understood how they think it is safer to transport oil by rail instead of pipeline. Very sad that Canadians can’t pull together to get this done.
730 2018-04-08 22:24:55 The ones i met are old but worked for oil companies
731 2018-04-08 22:24:55 Any gas or oil going to B.C. by pipeline should be shut down immediately.
732 2018-04-08 22:24:55 It’s a Power Air Fryer XL, comes with copper colored basket and cookbook.  One detail I didn’t mention is put foil on bottom, so drippings don’t burn onto bottom.  Try bloomin onion recipe and whole chicken recipe with olive oil and spices, makes really great meal. Reheats pizza.
733 2018-04-08 22:24:52 Maybe they will threaten to cut off the current oil.

Which will hurt them more in the end, and we might even be forced into moving to renewable energy sources.

Feeling pretty done with Alberta rn.
734 2018-04-08 22:24:46 This #Skripal business will likely be oil industry paid for private operation, with senior officer military blessing. Even royalty.
735 2018-04-08 22:24:45 We dont touch the stuff because when you ask us to buy some, you never tell us what you want, and when we come home with the wrong brand then all hell breaks loose. We keep track of your tampons just as much as you keep track of what kind of motor oil we use in our bikes...
736 2018-04-08 22:24:33 begs the question assumed multi dimensional chess China playing with oil futs just the imagination a fevered mind?
737 2018-04-08 22:24:23 The fight to #StopKM is not over. But oil companies have blinked first and revealed themselves to be paper tigers. They may look scary, but in reality they are not as powerful as the people. This is a fight we can win.
738 2018-04-08 22:24:21 How have the southern oil fields not made you stinking rich already?
739 2018-04-08 22:24:11 Really lets fill the rail and highways with oil and leave the food ( grain,poultry,beef,pork) on the prairies
740 2018-04-08 22:24:03 Oh please. What industry has contributed more good jobs & financed govt spending for infrastructure, health & social programs than the oil & gas industry? This is a huge loss for all of us, some just don't realize it yet.
741 2018-04-08 22:24:02 Well, in essence, with the Wallonian, I think we're all meeting there... It's all "langue d'oïl" after all. Fascinating to imagine that similar sonorities might have sprung from totally different parts of the world though!
742 2018-04-08 22:23:52 Yesssssss. I think it’s either oily or dehydrated (which just causes excess oil). So either way yes. Very.
743 2018-04-08 22:23:48 Are you kidding me? Huge win for the United States. All oil not produced by us will be produced elsewhere. Huge loss for Canada.
744 2018-04-08 22:23:44 You don't even know what your talking about. Cannabis oil saved my life and continues to keep my diabetes and cancer away. You keep on drinking and driving. I'll outlive you. When you get liver cancer go do some chemo and see how long you live
745 2018-04-08 22:23:38 Canny believe a was driving about with ma engine oil levels at 4%  surprised ma cars no in flames

749 2018-04-08 22:23:12 But the big wigs and goverment need to keep oil flowing into America or the machines will stop running to to the lack of four sight into the once glorious idea of battery to nuclear battery dependency.
750 2018-04-08 22:22:45 Keep shipping oil on trains and ships, it amazes me how incredibly naive and dumb some of you people are
751 2018-04-08 22:22:43 Oil? Pipeline?
752 2018-04-08 22:22:37 ★★★★★ Bought the Your 1st Essential Oil Recipe Box - Cancel at any time (Ships every 1 Months), check out my review!
753 2018-04-08 22:22:35 LOL. I said it before and I'll say it again. You are trying to kill your employers business. BioDiesel was a big thing years ago, when oil reached its peak. BioDiesel plants opened everywhere. They failed when the price of oil dropped. Z customers want petrol - nothing else.
754 2018-04-08 22:22:17 Once we can get Alberta oil to tidewater we can sell it to other countries, instead of taking a haircut to sell it into the states.
755 2018-04-08 22:22:04 After the @Youtube shooting, is this something @Twitter employees really want their CEO inviting to their front door? Thought becomes language becomes action. "Second Civil War"... Too many crazies on all sides to claim to be rhetorical. Useful idiots oil the machine.
756 2018-04-08 22:22:02 I don’t give a damn if the brakes fall off while I’m here. All I came for is an oil change. Nothing more, nothing less.
757 2018-04-08 22:21:59 Exactly what the liberals wanted. Funny how this announcement comes right after the PM’s visit out West. Obviously he didn’t convince anyone he was on our side. If there’s a rail disaster or a truck tanker disaster hauling oil to the coast this is on the fed’s.
758 2018-04-08 22:21:57 Been so long since i’ve actually painted my own nails I thought I had put cuticle oil on to realise it was top coat only when I got my finger stuck to my other finger whilst trying to rub it in

760 2018-04-08 22:21:45 U seem to believe the false narrative that holding big oil accountable for environmental pollution is the reason we not drilling in south Louisiana, If u know geology, u would understand the reason we not drilling and stop selling those false narratives
761 2018-04-08 22:21:25 Because it is jointly owned by Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch and the oil billionaire Koch brothers.  #ClimateMediaCoalition
762 2018-04-08 22:21:11 It could get worse. Oil companies are not selling at the differential price, but now, they’ve been producing all this time and are having to slow down production as they will run out of storage space for the oil. This pipeline will help that immensely.
763 2018-04-08 22:20:57 わかりてやんけー！
764 2018-04-08 22:20:50 The snake oil salesman always says he has the cure.. But  nothing happens..
765 2018-04-08 22:20:37 It really doesn’t matter. Your original comment just came off in a way that made it sound like I was being unrealistic for even suggesting someone could use that as a means of murder. Then you tell me it’s my age or sense of humor.
766 2018-04-08 22:20:28 And one third of the UK fishing fleet was wiped out in the 1970's by the oil price shock as they couldnt catch enough fish to pay for the diesel nothing to do with the EU another farage phallusy sic
767 2018-04-08 22:20:23 That was my thought as well.  
768 2018-04-08 22:19:55 okay I’m a terrible car owner. The only reason I just realized I haven’t checked my oil in months is because the dad in Wide Open Spaces yelled check the oil
769 2018-04-08 22:19:54 I would separate the returns from the potential to lose value.  Small caps should do better.  However, if there is a major issue they can also go bust.  A small oil company with BP's oil spill in Gulf of Mexico would of gone under but BP could survive.
770 2018-04-08 22:19:37 Honestly my fav pizza ever only has a bit of feta olive oil and garlic!

786 2018-04-08 22:17:37 When I get braids , I get coconut and olive oil in a bottle , heat it for like 2 minutes in the microwave and then put it in a spray bottle and spray my scalp. It loosens my pain in my opinion and the over the next 2-3 days I’ll be fine

835 2018-04-08 22:12:08 It will be the same message as Energy East cancellation - ‘This is a privacy company decision, we did everything to support it being built blah,blah. Also don’t forget we are exploring ($300K) why Canada is not competitive in the oil & gas industry’ Hmmmm
836 2018-04-08 22:11:55 This is the problem. It’s hard to support an industry that shits the bed often enough for it to be worrisome. Wish we’d figure out a safer way to transport our oil. We’ve only had 100+ years to figure it out 
837 2018-04-08 22:11:43 Lmfaooo yes!!! Never buying another oil Palmers is the truth
838 2018-04-08 22:11:41 I want hot fluffy croissants with olive oil butter in my mouth now now now but where do I get em fluffy croissants.....??? 
839 2018-04-08 22:11:38 Use coconut oil
840 2018-04-08 22:11:38 We should understand basic Guns vs Butter economics and vote for people who want to invest in healthcare, education, and infrastructure over war. It’s time to close bases & withdraw troops worldwide. Stop being bullies for Big Oil! Stop funding the masters of war!
841 2018-04-08 22:11:17 Ya I wonder the same, why did Europeans invade the Native Americans land? Why are is the USA and all those other countries colonizing Middle East and all African nations? Oh ya it’s because they have the oil and resources. Oh we allowed to go but they can’t come. Sad story.
842 2018-04-08 22:11:15 Do you need a cabana boy?  I make a great drink and can apply the perfect amount of oil. 
843 2018-04-08 22:11:10 I sadly hear the economic gears in Alberta’s oil patch grinding to a quick halt. Thanks for nothing @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley #2019 #MCGA
844 2018-04-08 22:11:09 MoH says ‘No’ nz hemp Oil. The Hemp legislation says ‘yes’.

846 2018-04-08 22:11:03 Back in the olden days Midnight Oil would have fun asking crowds who was at their first ever show, because  20% of the crowd would claim they were there despite the actual numer being about two dozen.

848 2018-04-08 22:10:56 Maybe the plan is to wait until the rest of the world runs out.

Then when they roll out the zero point energy antigrav flying cars we can try to sell oil?

859 2018-04-08 22:10:02 I'm so sorry to hear. I don't take opiods either for 15 years with chronic pain. Try cbd oil 1500mg for 7 and higher pain. I also use pain rub with emu oil from ctfo. Longvida turmeric is awesome, kratom and cannabis.
860 2018-04-08 22:09:57 I’m sorry y’all I don’t have a in depth skincare routine. I use biore black soap.. witch hazel as a toner and palmers skin therapy oil at night.
861 2018-04-08 22:09:54 Amagwinya are they made from flour deeped in oil?
862 2018-04-08 22:09:51 Time for Alberta and the Feds to start playing hardball. Stop shipping oil and gas to BC.
863 2018-04-08 22:09:49 It’s called bribes to FIFA officials, and when they were awarded the World Cup, things were fat, gas and oil prices were high

She started to pour the rich honey-coloured oil for the blonde ship girl.

874 2018-04-08 22:08:20 "Alright coo-..... Cooled.... oil?"

The bartender had to do a double take on that, tilting her head as if she was a lost puppy. After it registered in her mind, she got to work... going out back to get a bottle of fresh oil and a special cup for Iowa.

"Well... it's rare-

878 2018-04-08 22:07:48 Plus point, i even used to stan 2 groups she listed before i left kpop. I don't understand la these ppl. Like it's not enough that she was called bitch and disappointment by that rude guy now you want to add oil into the fire. Just because she stans only BTS 
879 2018-04-08 22:07:46 Get there sorry ass, to much talk, not enough action, Obama was all talk, its time to help these ppl, hell get cheap oil from it, this is like the 4th chemical attack, the hell with Russia, everybody scared of them, they should b scared of us

883 2018-04-08 22:07:37 Nivea with the Jojoba Oil. I use it sparingly. I also use coconut oil from time to time.
884 2018-04-08 22:07:37 Again, can't waste much time because so much inf out there, if genuinely interested (guessing not by the childish abuse) Syria is the only secular country left in middle east, who lived tolerantly attacking nobody. An oil rich country, with countless faiths living together.
885 2018-04-08 22:07:29 My question to BC govt is now that your inaction has allowed protestors to dictate public policy & hamper resource development, what are you doing to ensure BC uses less oil. I see a lot of cars on the road. You can’t be NIMBY & enjoy benefits of resource development at same time

894 2018-04-08 22:05:57 Did they mention we control the largest oilfields in Syria? The only area we control is where the largest oil fields reside. I wonder what’s happening to the money from all that oil? It’s not about the oil though, human rights is why. 
895 2018-04-08 22:05:46 And it turns like a oil tanker
896 2018-04-08 22:05:38 Oh no! Poor dear. I wish I could come over and help. Try coconut oil (I know, I know ... coconut oil for EVERYTHING ) or perhaps some cooled chamomile tea bags on your eyes after you've washed your face? I hope you feel better soon, honey!
897 2018-04-08 22:05:30 Venezuela socialised little beyond the oil. Big business can still undermibe food supply and the government failed to use oil revenues to diversify into wider business sectors. Unfortunately.

899 2018-04-08 22:05:19 They have taken 3 oilfields. More than worth any number of death, destruction and injuries to the oil companies who end up with them.
900 2018-04-08 22:04:56 a hot compress can help bring it to the surface and tea tree oil gel helps a fair bit for me personally 

but fair warning it's probably gonna come back in a few weeks/months in the same area because they always do :S
901 2018-04-08 22:04:50 Im not trading cryptos...nor have I ever ..I trade oil
902 2018-04-08 22:04:45 I think it's the oil AND the whole car industry. It's like @elonmusk is fighting against windmills. 99% of articles floating around are against Tesla. There are only a few positive ones. It's heartbreaking.
903 2018-04-08 22:04:36 @BlackOrchid_BBO has a really good body oil and their whipped shea buttet is divine.
904 2018-04-08 22:04:26 Palmers Deep Radiance Gel Oil mixed with Vaseline cocoa radiant body butter. Smells like chocolate and gives you a non greasy GLOW.
905 2018-04-08 22:04:24 wait what's the oil in this metaphor

910 2018-04-08 22:04:06 There's an organisation called Mediwiet who's good people are going around the country running workshops on how to make your own oil because they don't want to produce it to sell and make profit. Everyone can make their own.
911 2018-04-08 22:04:01 Coconut oil on your body 
912 2018-04-08 22:03:55 Palmer’s cocoa butter or coconut oil
913 2018-04-08 22:03:44 That is terrible idea. We’ll see how those with the coal smeared faces feel. When the market finds it but our planet is pile of shit. With oil spilled by the tons ruining our oceans & grasslands. But maybe Elon will make cheap electric cars or get us to Mars by then.....

925 2018-04-08 22:02:07 I think I like the Argon Oil Eco better than the Flaxseed 
926 2018-04-08 22:02:05 Those prosecutors claim that officials at Petrobas, the national oil and gas company, have long been colluding with a cartel of the country’s largest building contractors to enter into overpriced and fraudulent contracts
927 2018-04-08 22:02:04 Yes it may have shrunk but still has the highest GDP in the country. Despite a perfect storm of dairy price falls and oil price falls.
928 2018-04-08 22:02:00 Why is it that everytime my sister gets home i want to pour hot cooking oil on myself and die
929 2018-04-08 22:01:51 Patrick Reed is leaking oil
930 2018-04-08 22:01:35 I've always known that magnets are the solution to the pollution/oil dependency issue with transportation. But the oil corps are paying to keep the magnet industry quiet. 
931 2018-04-08 22:01:34 Good luck with your "clean tech" - you do know that coal, oil & gas are needed in vast quantities to build the infrastructure for "clean tech", right? JT is anything but pro-oil & this has everything to do with him & his govt.
932 2018-04-08 22:01:27 Back up to uni to find a smick stole our oil over easter break :) I’m dropping out
933 2018-04-08 22:01:23 So I’m cooking gumbo and i noticed it was too greasy. So I’m like something is off. Trav said you sure you didn’t read the recipe wrong and use too much oil. Just like you didn’t know the seafood goes in 30 mins before the gumbo is done
934 2018-04-08 22:01:18 Oh and FYI Hash is just another form of Cannabis, like Cannabis Oil is made from it as well. Our Endocannabinoid System requires Cannabinoids for Optimal health. USA Patent 6630507 says it's good for the brain, Britain's G. W. Pharmaceuticals holds the Patent on Cannabis curing
935 2018-04-08 22:01:14 Ummm I haven’t been consistent but about a month maybe? It’s as a lemon flavoured oil, 1-2ml under the tongue. It’s pricey but give it a go and see if it works for you. I only tried because my mum was using it!
936 2018-04-08 22:01:08 Of course its OVERBLOWN! Once you concede that you are corrupt you know EXACTLY what you are doing AND you dont care to here the other side COMPLAIN! Go for Traitorous EVIL Godless or some other classic stereotype, someday the world largest oil spill will be called PRUITT Lake!!!
937 2018-04-08 22:01:08 As long as there is oil in the Golan Heights we're not going anywhere. Expect more conflicts in East Syria.
938 2018-04-08 22:00:57 I put oil on two squeaky doors. That's about my lot. Though I didn't get up til 11am! #nottired
939 2018-04-08 22:00:50 @SenatorRounds ...as a South Dakota resident, I fear that your support of Scott Pruit, and by extension, Trump, our beautiful state will be decimated by the deregulations imposed.  Oil industry has pulled the wool over your eyes!
940 2018-04-08 22:00:35 You still have snake oil salesmen to count on.
941 2018-04-08 22:00:32 Tony Robbins’ disgracefully misogynistic comments have smeared the reputation of snake oil salesmen everywhere.

943 2018-04-08 22:00:11 By bold actions you mean raping the environment he is supposed to protect? Renting from and oil lobbyist? Not draining the swamp...adding to it. But I’m sure he contributed $$ to your campaign so that makes him qualified for the office. You’ll get your wake up call in 2018.
944 2018-04-08 21:59:53 Whose fault is it that Venezuela relies ‘solely’ on oil revenue??? If not your ‘heroic communist leaders’ then who?  They must be totally crap
945 2018-04-08 21:59:39 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

950 2018-04-08 21:58:59 Oil? Buggerall. Gas? Massive, Denmark sized, sovereign-wealth-fund reserves of gas. Poor? Only because Australian & US interests have actively wangled and connived for decades to swindle them out of it! What's going on here? Smells like an Eco-Imperialist astro-turfing operation.
951 2018-04-08 21:58:57 Miracleอย่างนั้นรึอืมมมมมม 
952 2018-04-08 21:58:57 On Friday, Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau was in Fort McMurray defending his government's decision and telling oil workers that the pipeline will be built. #transmountian #bcpoli #ableg #cdnpoli #canpol
953 2018-04-08 21:58:55 They do it so that make more money from you. I'd be willing to bet they get commission or some type of bonus when they get people to have something extra done besides the oil change
954 2018-04-08 21:58:52 You haven't held them responsible for shit. Denied Obama permission for military action. You would have sent in the marines if it had been a bigger oil producer

957 2018-04-08 21:58:18 The amount of oil in some of these pictures Sha. Na to carry bunch of plantain go photoshoot, with portable stove.
958 2018-04-08 21:57:59 Aka motor oil lol
959 2018-04-08 21:57:49 I've learned long ago to not guess age online, and barely in person. I've got 14 year old cousins who look 20. I'm nearing 30 and people think I look 19. Just always safe to talk and learn first.

965 2018-04-08 21:56:39 Notley will seek reelection so  she will go on and on about our protest, but those of us who were raised in Alberta mourn what the extraction of oil from the tar sands has done to that province. We are not going to surrender.
966 2018-04-08 21:56:30 Birkshire donated to Lead Now? You are mistaken. Krause hasn't even ALLEGED that. Rocefeller Bros (different entity than Roce Finance, R. Bros charitable owns NO oil cos), are on record as climate change activists, finance and support the Tides Foundation.

969 2018-04-08 21:55:42 Like, we have NDP leaders that are openly against Israeli apartheid and one even campaigned on nationalizing our oil sands last year. The state NDP parties made the min wage $15 in two provinces already. They're good but we lack that energy m'man
970 2018-04-08 21:55:36 He's from South Dakota, where thete's a huge oil and gas boom. He LOVES @ScottPruittOK because he wants to rape the environment for $$$$$
971 2018-04-08 21:55:35 Patrick Reed has leaked more oil than Mr. Janet's old truck, but he's still ahead standing in the 15th fairway looking at his third shot.
972 2018-04-08 21:55:28 Are they oil filled?
973 2018-04-08 21:55:22 The nostalgia critic is an sjw in spite of the fact that he defended nuclear power in a review of a Superman movie and oil in his Saved By The Bell review. #libertarianlogic 
(No I don't want to defend him, especially given recent events but nonsense is nonsense.)
974 2018-04-08 21:55:21 Probably because the rest of the country is sick of foreign oil.
975 2018-04-08 21:55:18 Been wonder when the Kochopus was going to  pop up in Trump Russia. I mean beside the fact their father made his money on Russian oil. 

They've been gathering data points on us, perhaps as many as 5000 on each of us. Now just heard a whisper they're involved in Federalist and CA
976 2018-04-08 21:55:14 No choice but to manually clean oceans on boats and converted oil rigs.@extinctsymbol or make drone cleaning ships, and lots of them. know any engineers?
977 2018-04-08 21:55:08 Oil of Olay sampled Clark Sisters!!! “Hi-yah” means “Life”. Wow!!!!
978 2018-04-08 21:54:38 Moisturising with Marula oil is another world....... I feel like a beautiful glazed ham
979 2018-04-08 21:54:36 Naija has no oil refineries.... Crazy! They deserve it.
980 2018-04-08 21:54:33 Mostly fresh from scratch foods. Some bacon or sausage noting canned/boxed. I'll try the coconut oil mask. Any particular brand or just straight coconut oil?
981 2018-04-08 21:54:23 Running out of oil in your car has an effect. What does it mean to the earth???
982 2018-04-08 21:54:13 I consistently get mine done and my real lashes are still very happy :) I just condition them with castor oil after each time I take a break from extensions.
983 2018-04-08 21:54:07 Chicken soup. NEB process was poorly equipped to deal with rapid change in social complexity of oil sands file. Responses often ham-fisted. That's transcended governments.
984 2018-04-08 21:54:01 Yeah he's a creepy cheapskate and he spends our tax dollars like there's no tomorrow BUT he lets big oil dirty up our water and air so conservatives just adore the guy.
985 2018-04-08 21:53:43 Hmmm. That oil is going to get to the market anyway. So I guess in the absence of a pipeline, truck & train right. Aren't pipelines saving GHG emissions. Environmentalists are the most hypocritical of all. Increased GHG emissions today, killed jobs & the economy. Way to go!
986 2018-04-08 21:53:28 BC coastal environment & life it supports is precious and unique. No effective dilbit (bitumen) cleanup from spills on land or in the ocean exists. Alberta has been destroyed by oil greed & now it is said that this pipeline & 7 times the tanker traffic is in our best interest. NO
987 2018-04-08 21:53:25 THERE IS GAY FUCKERY ON POTTERY THEY FIGURED OUT THAT THERE WAS HIGH USE OF OLIVE OIL IN GREECE CAUSE BROS GOTTA BRO GAYS COULD TATTOO THEYRE GAYNESS INTO THEIR BONES AND LEAVE STONE EPITAPHS OF EVERY ONE OF THEIR GAY CONQUESTS CARVED INTO STONE AND PPL STILL BE LIKE idk man :/
988 2018-04-08 21:52:52 “Oh, you mean women won’t accept my BS victim shaming and intimidation?  Well shoot, I still want to peddle my scams so I probably should ‘apologize’.” We see right through you as the snake oil salesmen you are. Go F yourself. #MeToo  #TonyRobbinsNeedsALifeCoach
989 2018-04-08 21:52:37 Him mine is good!! What’s your diet like? Use coconut oil as a mask for it!
990 2018-04-08 21:52:32 This needs to stop! He acts like no other politician and seems to have no shame. He's making more and more enemies each day, especially for ruining the environment to boost coal, oil, and mining industries without limits!
991 2018-04-08 21:52:27 Because they are politicians mate.

They feds just approved Cdn Atlantic offshore shale oil drilling & they support #bclng. 

The carbon tax is just greenwashing n delaying. Oil n gas desperately trying to off load their reserves b4 the gate close.
992 2018-04-08 21:52:05 "That is simply up to you. I'll even provide the oil you wanted. It'll be a nice warming oil."
993 2018-04-08 21:52:01 I did technical support for one of his events once. He wasn't there. One of his underlings did it. I spent several hourd with him before the event. He actually asked me to ask his wife to do jobs so that he didn't have to ( less earache) Snake oil salesman, imo.
994 2018-04-08 21:51:59 All this postering is a push from Putin.  It worries me.  Assad is a loose cannon supported by Putin.  Europe needs Russian oil.  Bad intentions could end up in all out war.
995 2018-04-08 21:51:54 never used a wave kit .. just oil sheen and brushing .. my waves natural bitch 
996 2018-04-08 21:51:53 .@AJDinger reporting his motor is blowing up. Says he has no oil pressure. #NASCAR
997 2018-04-08 21:51:51 Exactly!! My theory: he is either mentally ill with paranoia or did business with the wrong oil oligarchs at some point...
998 2018-04-08 21:51:44 At least Trump will not cave in to the demands for fuel, oil, food etc that will come... for unverifiable dismantling of nuclear facilities.    I hope.
999 2018-04-08 21:51:37 There's just something about the physics in that level that make it hell compared to the original oil ocean.
1000 2018-04-08 21:51:36 Check out Lindsay Williams videos he thinks there is enough oil going to come out of Alaska to ensure USA stays on top
1001 2018-04-08 21:51:23 ITS NOT ASAD, CIA MADE IT FAKE FOR DEFACING ASAD, AND KILL HIM, THEN USA CAN TAKE FULL CONTROL OF SYRIAN OIL.
1002 2018-04-08 21:51:22 @realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump please research rising fuel prices. James D Berry of the Quaker State Oil company was a close personal friend until his death. Jimmy would always say gas prices are so inflated it was criminal. A family that made their fortune off of oil. Help pensioner
1003 2018-04-08 21:50:49 Oh, you mean women won’t accept my BS victim shaming and intimidation?  Well shoot, I still want to peddle my scams so I probably should “apologize”. We see right through you as the snake oil salesmen you are. Go F yourself. #MeToo #TonyRobbinsNeedsALifeCoach

1005 2018-04-08 21:50:27 The most damning information to come out, IMO, is that Shell foresaw oil companies being sued for their role in climate change in future scenarios the made decades ago. The knew that their industry was disrupting the climate, and they knew they were in the wrong.
1006 2018-04-08 21:50:23 I’ve been using/testing the items in the gift package & they’re all terrific.  The weather is harsh where I am but the moisturizing oil keeps the skin soft & combats dryness & cold temps! Still waiting for spring!
1007 2018-04-08 21:50:19 Positive effect of EEC membership took hold after some years of membership. Just like the false prosperity now, before the coming fall in wages and jobs. We were saved by N Sea oil and EU single market. IMF within 10 years. Our young people dumped on AGAIN by selfish boomers
1008 2018-04-08 21:50:16 OIL IN MYBACKYARD SJBSJSBDJS
1009 2018-04-08 21:49:43 i have a sunday riley night oil and when i put it on i look like a grease explosion
1010 2018-04-08 21:49:41 Ohtani is downright freightening this afternoon...@lunz71 is one lucky bastard 
1011 2018-04-08 21:49:28 Dipping bread into rosemary garlic seasoning mixed with some olive oil >>>>  HEAVEN.
1012 2018-04-08 21:49:17 Of course, the one nice gift Kai gives to me (white, silk gloves that are supposed to be for princesses), ends up being dirt, covered in oil, and crushed by my sister Pearl, who spilled all my tools on them  #Jealous #MostBeautifulThingsIHaveEverOwned #SomeStainsNeverComeOut
1013 2018-04-08 21:49:16 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
1014 2018-04-08 21:48:52 Tying in so nicely with the Skripal saga ... except that the Skripal story unravelled. Altho Boris Johnson, in an attempt to support the US/Allies ME oil/gas/land grabbing war machine, is trying to undermine Russia’s support for Syria and Iran by insulting Russia.
1015 2018-04-08 21:48:47 One rich oil man to another.
1016 2018-04-08 21:48:39 Requiring the industry to move to better quality fuel would be a big step.  Bunker oil should be eliminated and the ships need to use Shore Power while docked.
1017 2018-04-08 21:48:24 Lol I wasn’t, but too much oil mass your hair oily and weighed down looking
1018 2018-04-08 21:48:06 And I'm blinded by your hatred and refusal to acknowledge any of the good things Trump has done and is trying to do. He has appointed good supreme court judge, approved pipe line, opened Anwar oil reserves, brought N. Korea to table, good tax cuts, low employment rate, good jobs
1019 2018-04-08 21:48:03 In Yemen , daily bombs on kids , from KSA airforce , bombs selled by UK , still happening btw !
Yemen the forgotten war !
100.000 deaths already in some years , why NATO or whoeffer is not punishing KSA for that ?
Money oil games /hypocrite west !
1020 2018-04-08 21:47:58 Wish I had oil so these fine women could all come invade me  #FineFemalesInMilitary
1021 2018-04-08 21:47:29 Dude is a total  oil salesman/ charlatan and millions of Americans fell for him
1022 2018-04-08 21:47:28 I give u the current status quo.. all deals signed since Lima agreement have bought us to today.. and we're being fleeced billions by foreign corporates n local oligarchs..
ie..crude oil down $100$au/bbl and not a cent passed on to the consumer...
1023 2018-04-08 21:47:27 You should have asked for the chilli oil...
1024 2018-04-08 21:47:25  mate your the one getting it up the bum oil by kk.. I've got to be in Manchester early for an assessment day
1025 2018-04-08 21:47:10 Is that olive oil from Frankie’s in nyc?
1026 2018-04-08 21:47:10 Full me up till I overflow! I wanna run over!
“Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over” 
1027 2018-04-08 21:47:04 Great homemade dip...chocolate chips, karo syrup and coconut oil ;)
1028 2018-04-08 21:47:00 Kind of like going into Iraq based on untruths and an idea we could steal their oil and totally screwing up balance of powers in Middle East.
1029 2018-04-08 21:46:58 This is exactly what the Liberals & Notley wanted, now they can blame Kinder Morgan for pulling out and satisfy their eco base.
Too bad about Canadians wanting to improve the economy with an environmentally responsible resource....oh well, middle eastern oil for us 
1030 2018-04-08 21:46:56 Bitch your granny bald ass hell bitch gotta shiny as head look like he put oil on a motherfucka oh fat ass and yo Daddy sit back and watch Oprah and eat corn chips with his lazy ass
1031 2018-04-08 21:46:38 Coconut oil pulling:
10/10 for the benefits 
0/10 for the experience
1032 2018-04-08 21:46:26 Eat the oil, builds strong bones
1033 2018-04-08 21:46:25 World oil supply is finite.
USA doesn't yet need this offshore oil and it should be "banked" for the ages ahead when we've exhausted more conventional sources and shale.
1034 2018-04-08 21:46:21 You like this hey, hope you like it when there is no oil flowing to B.C., also if you are against oil just a heads up, without it you don’t have a phone to look at Twitter on!
1035 2018-04-08 21:46:15 I’m crazy stressed about school but instead of doing my homework I’m just gonna drown myself in eucalyptus essential oil
1036 2018-04-08 21:46:14 But also, why is Tony Robbins--charlatan snake oil 90s guy--still on the national stage at all? I thought we all agreed he was a huckster and moved on???
1037 2018-04-08 21:45:58 I never paid attention to Tony Robins (except for his role in Shallow Hal) as I always saw him as a cross between a snake oil salesman and a confidence man. Now I’m moving from indifference to distaste. #metoo
1038 2018-04-08 21:45:49 Not doing things like drilling for oil, coal mining & burning fossil fuels while trying to find new environmentally friendly ways to produce energy. Has nothing to do with jumping on a bandwagon or evil things like slavery. I’m sure it they all have something to do with greed tho
1039 2018-04-08 21:45:39 So...coconut oil is actually not healthy food wise, and I’ve learned that it’s really not skin friendly either. Now the real question is, is it really even hair friendly?
1040 2018-04-08 21:45:30 Looks like he needs some Oil...
1041 2018-04-08 21:45:22 I've been thinking about getting some for mum, to help with her tremors.
But the oil is so expensive, and I'm not sure of the potency. So I'm trying to find tablets/capsules.
1042 2018-04-08 21:45:21 Incredible showman with people lining up for his snake oil.
Honest. No. Diplomatic.  No
Caring. No. Respected by his peers. No. Feared. Yes . Admired by his minions yes.
1043 2018-04-08 21:45:19 Haha... you're burning midnight oil 
1044 2018-04-08 21:45:17 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
1045 2018-04-08 21:45:02 Add to that blockchain tech (in a decade or two), where people will be able to see (ie.) where you bought your last car and when you changed oil on it, and you have yourself a nice distopian world.

None of theze leaders give a fuk about poisoned children. This is for control of the Oil pipeline.

1050 2018-04-08 21:44:21 Big Oil and Koch Brothers gotta pay me extra for that one. Union FUD rules.
1051 2018-04-08 21:44:10 The oil is heavy and costs you something!!!!!!
1052 2018-04-08 21:44:06 getting my @cbdbrothers oil tomorrow. i’ve been a week without my cbd, idek how i’m still functioning. goodbye mental instability lmao
1053 2018-04-08 21:44:04 Hopefully something can be resolved otherwise this is the kiss of death for our oil industry, and for AB/SK relations with B.C./Feds

1056 2018-04-08 21:43:46 When you SERIOUSLY look at poicy actions directed by this government, whether  its Pruitt' security detail which costsover $3 mil, or Zinke giving National-Monument land to oil/gas developers, or just about anything, it FEELS LIKE WE ARE BEING DIRECTED BY A LIBERTARIAN GOVERNMENT
1057 2018-04-08 21:43:41 In all fairness make sure the reader notes that this PHONY has received over $200,000 from oil. gas and coal interests.
And, he advocated that Trump pull out of the Paris Accords.
Any questions as to why he sides with evangelical deacon Pruitt?

1059 2018-04-08 21:43:40 Assad isn’t the one who’s ordering those attacks... these rebel groups were formed during the Obama admin and funded by Soros/Clinton & Co money. Syria has it’s own oil and currency - an independence Assad is trying to protect. Please know what you’re talking about!! @sahouraxo

1068 2018-04-08 21:42:36 Under Trudeau Canada's economy is tanking. It's childish ignorance to ignore that oil is a huge economic income for Canada, it can't just be dismissed without an alternative income source. BC needs also needs the pipeline to lower fuel costs $ reduce coastal ships from the US.

1082 2018-04-08 21:41:03 Time for Alberta to shut off the oil to BC.

1084 2018-04-08 21:40:59 No it's not ... there are other alternatives than oil. Instead of spending billions on removing what the earth needs why not invest on the alternatives  Jobs will still be created without chancing our environment.
1085 2018-04-08 21:40:32 Quite - it's all gone completely mental and people are being whipped up into crazy state by snake oil salesmen who love themselves and don't like forriners - UK becomes a Banana Republic #StopBrexit PLEASE

1095 2018-04-08 21:39:23 The transition away from oil can't happen soon enough. Then the gulf countries will all go bankrupt and stop funding backwards bullshit around the world and we can move on from the middle ages, finally, and reach for our cosmic endowment.

1101 2018-04-08 21:38:21 That's a reference intended to make fun of the "Its the item not the purpose crowd."  You may be too old or out of the comic loop to get it.  No shame because it is moderately obscure.
1102 2018-04-08 21:38:18 The Saudis use NA oil money to invade, start proxy war with Turkey, and begin bombing Chinese training camps- blame USA, and Russia starts 'shoot on sight' air-traffic protocol for all military/civilian flights near Damascus... Kurdistan ground invasion under UN authorization.

1104 2018-04-08 21:38:06 @MySteveLaurant The lip oil in orchid is AMAZING! I got mine in an Ipsy bag but i will definitely be purchasing after i am all out. It has repaired my dry cracked lips!! #amazing
1105 2018-04-08 21:38:00 Snake oil salesman. Same as a preacher.
1106 2018-04-08 21:37:37 His predictions are like those of a snake oil salesman, carry no water.
1107 2018-04-08 21:37:16 Oh you should read up on China’s actions in africa- truly fascinating efforts of exploitation- mostly concerning oil, telecommunications, and rare earth natural resources. Believe about 7-10% of their covert ops take place in China as well. And they love their ivory, etc.
1108 2018-04-08 21:37:07 They're gonna drill it into everyone's heads until they strike oil
1109 2018-04-08 21:37:02 ...how the heck is this other oil painting i've been working on still wet after THREE DAYS

goddamn magic paints
1110 2018-04-08 21:36:51 You realize tankers are using the same inlets to access Washington to bring in oil from Alaska and overseas and export Alberta oil right?
1111 2018-04-08 21:36:41 Been massaging argan oil onto my eyelids and under my eyes for 2 months now 
And I can say my eyelashes have grown Alhamdulillah 

Never again am I getting eyelash extensions
1112 2018-04-08 21:36:37 Tony is a snake oil salesman. A very successful one.
1113 2018-04-08 21:36:33 @RealTimers @billmaher I have personally “boycotted” @exxonmobil since the #ExxonValdez incident. They never paid mandated penalties nor finished the oil spill cleanup. Nor will I ever buy even a bag of chips from an Exxon. My right to patron what businesses I choose.
1114 2018-04-08 21:36:33 I would much rather prefer to have Iran being an independent autonomous state than it being controlled by congress and western backed oil companies like it was from 1953-1978.
1115 2018-04-08 21:36:23 
1116 2018-04-08 21:36:14 Olive oil is perfect for small roasted potatoes; absolutely. But my brother would cut me dead if I dared serve them for Sunday roast. The roast potato debate is HUGE in our family.
1117 2018-04-08 21:36:13 Snake oil part 4!!
1118 2018-04-08 21:36:06 I wouldn't go that far, just wrap the assault sharp edges.
1119 2018-04-08 21:36:01 Hey Al you are starting to look worse and worse..Any chance you pay all your back taxes before its too late? It's bad enough you are a racist Un-American snake oil salesman..Don't be a leeching drain on society by not paying your fair share as well.
1120 2018-04-08 21:35:46 Well, I was thinking more you can strangle somebody, but okay.
1121 2018-04-08 21:35:16 Can't even deny that. Needa whip out the coconut oil.
1122 2018-04-08 21:35:15 @MACcosmetics will you be coming out with a bronzing body dry oil any time soon??
1123 2018-04-08 21:35:14 Some of us are searching for oil.  
Stop telling us what to do.
1124 2018-04-08 21:35:04 RT @LivingSafely: #Kraft Italian Dressing this April? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
1125 2018-04-08 21:34:56 I need more essential oils I just run out of them so fast especially lavender and cedar wood oil bc I use them in like everyyyything I need like a full spice rack filled w every oil 
1126 2018-04-08 21:34:39 I have a cuticle oil from gelish but Argan oil from Walmart is good for your hair skin and nails it’s over by the vitamins
1127 2018-04-08 21:34:33 I’ll bring the duck tape!
1128 2018-04-08 21:34:31 @cpimspeak WE ARE THE GREATEST LEADER OF THE YOU ALL.WE READY TO POUR NIGHT'S OIL INTO IT.
1129 2018-04-08 21:34:27 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
1130 2018-04-08 21:34:13 Well, if burning wood causes significant cooling, then Alberta should get credit for the Fort McMurray forest fires. That should make up for at least 10 years of oil sands product. Now we have even more social license!!! Wee! Perhaps we should burn down even more  ... </sarcasm>
1131 2018-04-08 21:34:09 You ain’t nothing slick to a can of oil
1132 2018-04-08 21:34:04 Woodlock oil!
 
1133 2018-04-08 21:33:53 Usually I just put the hot coffee and a tablespoon of the oil in a blender for about like 30 seconds, I’ll add a tbs of ORGANIC GRASS-FED butter (v important that it’s not just regular butter) if I feel like mixing it up and making it exxxtra rich
1134 2018-04-08 21:33:53 CIA =Skripal. 
Syria=Oil.
1135 2018-04-08 21:33:52 Spend ten minutes and create a piece of artwork that features growth patterns, in a relaxed style using oil pastels.
1136 2018-04-08 21:33:47 Atlets are the tiny plastic things on the ends of shoe strings...  They carry a sinister purpose.
1137 2018-04-08 21:33:44 The name Trudeau and Oil and the west.  The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.
1138 2018-04-08 21:33:43 We are looking for a beard oil to carry in our salon.
1139 2018-04-08 21:33:19 Attention Rex Manning fans to your left you will notice a shoplifter being chased by night manager, Lucas. This young man will be caught, deep fried in a vat of hot oil & served to our first 100 customers. Just another tasty treat from the gang at Empire Records. #RexManningDay
1140 2018-04-08 21:33:02 Oils are good! Like cuticle oil but I’d definitely say a vitamin that’s meant for your hair, skin and nails!
1141 2018-04-08 21:33:01 Ban fists , rocks, and all dangerous objects.
1142 2018-04-08 21:32:50 I spilled an entire bottle of lavender essential oil in my room but at least it’s gonna have a super chill atmosphere now
1143 2018-04-08 21:32:27 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
1144 2018-04-08 21:32:26 You’re only the imperialist’s friend as long as you sell them cheap oil and let them use your air space

1147 2018-04-08 21:32:05 This shit is too real to be an oil painting. But in case it is, get job bruh!
1148 2018-04-08 21:32:02 Castor oil smell horrendous but I have no choice if I want to get these locs
1149 2018-04-08 21:32:00 Also make sure you are getting one that vapes your preferred mmj. You have a choice of bud, wax and oil with wax being the more common form for vapes.
1150 2018-04-08 21:31:55 オリーブオイルbotヾ(*´・ω・`*)おやすみなさぁ～ぃ
1151 2018-04-08 21:31:52 Might just be me but I feel like it makes it worse!! Olive oil saved my skin!! Sounds gross but it genuinely worked x
1152 2018-04-08 21:31:47 Ministry (grain&oil) care to expand? 
1153 2018-04-08 21:31:31 ETFs trade on a stock exchange and can be purchased and sold in a manner similar to stocks. Buying one share of the U.S. Oil Fund (USO) would give you exposure to roughly one barrel of oil. No cap.
1154 2018-04-08 21:31:23 Eggs, oil, emulsify. Lol
1155 2018-04-08 21:31:00 There's nothing more useless than a man without a knife.

1158 2018-04-08 21:30:38 I will not accept potbelly slander. Potbelly big Italian sub on wheat with provolone, lettuce, onions, tomato, avocado, oil, and seasoning is the most delicious thing on this planet earth
1159 2018-04-08 21:30:35 .... allowed to go there and do that. But it’s more like who wants to control the oil, who wants to have power over the lands. Oh why do you think the U.S and all other nations are involved? Of course it’s economical and political reasons.
1160 2018-04-08 21:30:32 Penne lisce works best with olive oil or pasta salads. Bran makes homemade penne lisce by overcooking rigate :D
1161 2018-04-08 21:30:32 The cleansing, healing oil of the Holy Spirit is applied to our hearts when we are hurt or wounded.
1162 2018-04-08 21:30:18 Have you checked the oil? Probably seized.
1163 2018-04-08 21:30:18 Is pizza grease considered an essential oil? (Asking for a friend)
1164 2018-04-08 21:30:17 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
1165 2018-04-08 21:30:08 Ah, I figured you did... a lot of the youngins around Eugene are straight oil fiends though. I’ve showed many of them jars and they have no clue what it is 
1166 2018-04-08 21:30:00 Does the US really want to leave Syria and the Middle East? who will look after all the poppy fields and free them of all that excess Oil? Politics and Fiat - the root of all evil......!!
1167 2018-04-08 21:29:54 Oil giant Shell was aware of the consequences of climate change, and the role fossil fuels were playing in it, as far back as 1988, documents unearthed by a Dutch news organisation have revealed.- Dutch royalty is a big investor in Shell @Independent
1168 2018-04-08 21:29:35 Who has ever tried evening primrose oil ? It really does reduce anxiety 
1169 2018-04-08 21:29:32 I beat my face today just to go to stop and shop for kitty litter. Just feeling myself since Ole Henrikson Truth Oil has given me a new face #SelfCareSunday 
1170 2018-04-08 21:29:27 Oil wells and commodity based oil exchange trading funds is my next investment. No cap.
1171 2018-04-08 21:29:21 I guess it depends on what one wants to do and the job market in one's area. We di have A LOT of General MBAs here though due in part to the last recession and now oil crash.
1172 2018-04-08 21:29:14 So @vanOnselenP your "Wow" of yesterday was actually deceptive advertising. Shame on you. And on @KKeneally for spreading your snake oil.
1173 2018-04-08 21:29:02 Harperman claimed to be this top
economist,yet it was the foreign 
companies,that benefited from 
oil profits,  they all took the money
and ran when the price started
to tank. And today these numb sculls
want another forty years of these
incompetency.
1174 2018-04-08 21:28:54 Both govts are corrupt, diff is that kenyan govt steals taxpayers money which is almost the govt source of income since we dont have rich resources like oil.. our lovely nigerians Dangote & their govt have privatized the national resource thus need no taxmoney to steal
1175 2018-04-08 21:28:51 That's totally legit, in my book. Our approach in the ED is to pour oil in the ear, which quiets the beastie. Then can be flushed out easily.
1176 2018-04-08 21:28:51 You can't do roast potatoes properly in olive oil. No. No. No. Beef dripping, vegetable or sunflower oil.  Semolina shouldn't even be in the same room.
1177 2018-04-08 21:28:47 Nice fresh @RAVENOLUK oil added today thank you!
1178 2018-04-08 21:27:58 Time to stop the flow of oil west to the coast ! Enough is enough of this s#$&! No more talk, action!
1179 2018-04-08 21:27:55 I would play around w some oils and see which one works the best!! I use almond oil, and spray lots of toner before and after applying and it has worked better at keeping my face moisturized than creams.
1180 2018-04-08 21:27:46 You did asking if I had any baby oil and a body suit.
1181 2018-04-08 21:27:37 Tobi: that’s not banga, 
Miracle: that is palm oil, as in nkwu, don’t you know it
Tobi: yes now I know palm oil

1183 2018-04-08 21:27:30 Why did I jus buy massage oil, do I even have anyone to massage my back
1184 2018-04-08 21:27:22 "I'd take a can of cooled oil, please!" The girl placed her rather odd order, she considered it as a normal kind of drink due to being a shipgirl.
1185 2018-04-08 21:27:09 You hanging out? Get $50 credit w/ Lyft code ZOOT -- Ever enjoy a Corn N' Oil! ^ Holy Moly! that's a great one!
1186 2018-04-08 21:27:08 Libya is also conquered coz of resources .nxt will b bahrain coz of biggest oil reserves in d 
1187 2018-04-08 21:27:07 Please continue to cover heath cures, fluoride free, vaccine, CBH oil etc..
1188 2018-04-08 21:26:57 I love the Bumble and Bumble hairdresser’s invisible oil shampoo and conditioner!! My cousin who is a hairdresser swears by it and it has worked wonders for me!
1189 2018-04-08 21:26:41 I make it myself and love it as a peanut butter substitute. I roast sunflower seeds then blend them in a food processor with a little oil, sugar & salt
1190 2018-04-08 21:26:28 Really?? Just the oil itself? How do you make your coffee because I wanna try this
1191 2018-04-08 21:26:16 Shoestrings.
1192 2018-04-08 21:26:15 Shout out to @TatianaHoecker for lending me The Alchemist hardcover in spanish.. just read the first page and cried tears of olive oil. this mediterranean diet really getting to me... #narciso
1193 2018-04-08 21:26:04 Lil red need a car wash, a oil change, some new windshield wipers, new speakers and some gas 
1194 2018-04-08 21:26:02 New #US military reinforcements to a#Shaddadi and AL_Omar oil field in northeastern #Syria
1195 2018-04-08 21:26:01 In your mind, oil spilled from wells is different from oil spilled from pipe lines. And oil spilled from tankers? And oil sands shipped by rail to cause deaths and destruction different again?See, its the death and destruction is the same.
1196 2018-04-08 21:25:47 Also ships are energy efficient not because they are big but because they are afloat and not supporting most of their own weight. A lorry/truck or a car the same size as an oil tanker but on a road would not be at all energy efficient. See the horse moving canal barge example
1197 2018-04-08 21:25:30 I've been using The Ordinary's Argan Oil on my face lately for dryness and tbh I've found it more plump and hydrated in about a week or so, I also LOVE scrubs and doing them once or twice a week.
1198 2018-04-08 21:25:20 Burnaby Mountain marchers face being arrested by fed laws putting oil rights above their rights to own land free of threats to pollute it. Where is the MP ready to call out unjust law that would deny them the right to stand in the way of foreign pipeline?
1199 2018-04-08 21:25:20 Is @nytimes in the pocket of the oil industry?
1200 2018-04-08 21:24:51 how much did you get the oil and from where?
1201 2018-04-08 21:24:48 I heard Joe Jones struck oil with Bradshaw's noggin. #Browns
1202 2018-04-08 21:24:46 I do know that Tomas Vanek signed a 1-year $2 million deal & scored 10 more goals & 22 more points than any winger on the Oil. Would have been a useful way to spend some of the Eberle minus Strome cap savings
1203 2018-04-08 21:24:44 There's an increasing shortage of workers in construction, agriculture,oil drilling,etc.,especially in Midwest. The response should me a modern version of the "bracero"program used during& after WWII.Workers would come on date limited visa,did their jobs,go home&return if needed.
1204 2018-04-08 21:24:36 A reboot is usually an extraction of value from an audience's memory the same way you extract value from oil sands or the lower class. It entails very low investment and risk and is guaranteed for a pretty big payoff. It's fansucking, not fanbuilding.
1205 2018-04-08 21:24:23 Magnesium oil really helps me to stay asleep. Might be worth a try 
1206 2018-04-08 21:24:23 i’m using coconut oil to highlight my face and lips while taking selfies and now it’s all over my phone screen gross
1207 2018-04-08 21:24:23 when was violence and oil more important than babies' lives? :( #savesyriaschildren
1208 2018-04-08 21:24:18 No retailer should be stocking products that put the Antarctic Ocean at risk. @BootsUK as leading krill oil stockist, when will you step up and #ProtectAntarctic?
1209 2018-04-08 21:23:49 If corn oil comes from corn and olive oil comes from olives, where the heck does baby oil come from?
1210 2018-04-08 21:23:39 8 oil
1211 2018-04-08 21:23:30 Oil
1212 2018-04-08 21:23:29 Aye the new skin care stuff in Pink is a scam. Y’all looks the ingredient list. They promote that it’s coconut oil and all that but they last on the ingredient list. How ?? Lol
1213 2018-04-08 21:23:10 Such bs that Assad did this... McCain was in area just before the last bs chemical attack... neocons and deepstate want to keep us in Syria for the oil and resources.. perpetual war.. bs chem attack.. one in 2013 debunked. Assad protects Christians like Putin
1214 2018-04-08 21:23:07 "selling snake oil is his business model, and he can’t change without losing everything. And that’s the kind of guy Republicans want"
1215 2018-04-08 21:23:07 Why act like you care when EPA is doing everything he can to lessen the benefits of a clean environment for example allowing pesticides, emission, leaking oil pipelines, dirty air and water. Clean coal? You and your family are a joke.
1216 2018-04-08 21:22:54 Just a guess, but there may have been a little oil money involved. #SpoilerAlert #Sad
1217 2018-04-08 21:22:38 It was rhetorical of course, we also need them to sell our arms and buy their oil
1218 2018-04-08 21:22:32 Mike Rounds doesn’t care about the millions of gallons of oil spilled by the Keystone pipeline in his home state due to Pruitt’s roll backs.  I hope he likes to drink oil.
1219 2018-04-08 21:22:29 GT Bank that's charging me for Card Maintenance would soon come and tell me when they changed the engine oil for my 3 years old ATM card? 
1220 2018-04-08 21:22:22 Oil reserves to be conquered
1221 2018-04-08 21:22:18 @MongoGoesInsane I’m gonna get nude, oil myself up and order fried fish tonight in honor of wrestlemania tonight, fuck face.
1222 2018-04-08 21:22:12 Tony Robbins is a garbage human snake oil salesman
1223 2018-04-08 21:22:11 No doubt brother, I do a heavy rotation between flower, oil, bubble (remember good ole hash ?) and edibles to ultimately get where I need to be...
1224 2018-04-08 21:22:05 Summer is around and I’m counting down the days to where I can be laid out in the sun with coconut oil on my body.
1225 2018-04-08 21:21:55 That’s a win for round two. Back to the pit to get ready for round two! NAPA Filters NAPA KNOW HOW Lucas Oil MAHLE Motorsport North America
1226 2018-04-08 21:21:29 What about the USS Porter’s collision with the Japanese oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz 5 years ago?
1227 2018-04-08 21:21:29 Me too! I miss the days of the oil boom! We were so blessed to live that life. Looks like it's coming back! Eeek. Means I will be able to move home finally 
1228 2018-04-08 21:21:05 Love this
1229 2018-04-08 21:21:03 *Never heard of him* until he showed up as a reference in a previously female-only forum 2 days ago with a "what do you think, he has a point" & I thought "woman-hating mega-church snake oil guy". Dafuq? Why are ppl looking for messiahs? He's *a mannequin*.
1230 2018-04-08 21:20:57 If you must know the U.S only buys oil but has enough reserved of our own in which we produced, the reason we buy it is so we remain sufficient when Saudi Arabia can no longer sell us anymore, your ideas are not just wrong but demented, do some research bud
1231 2018-04-08 21:20:56 As we learned in the 1970s, high fuel prices and long lines at the gas pumps can damage the US political careers. America demands abundant, affordable oil. Where there is oil, US wars will continue.
1232 2018-04-08 21:20:34 I need an oil change and my nails done.
1233 2018-04-08 21:20:30 All of it is the Oil brush :)
1234 2018-04-08 21:20:12 no.... you'll end up chained to a oil tank in a basement :)
1235 2018-04-08 21:20:01 Chilli oil or Tabasco or Buffalo sauce for dipping.

and you can never eat too many shu mai
1236 2018-04-08 21:19:59 There’s no loop holes in the new regulations for oil development. In fact it guarantees that no new oil projects will built in Canada until another government is elected. Something to feel ashamed and embarrassed about, by most of us who did not do enough to pushback against nuts
1237 2018-04-08 21:19:59 I used to until I found woodlock oil. You only need a little and it lasts for a few hours once it is rubbed in. Better than having to pop pills all the time.  There is no cure for my type of arthritis so natural remedies are better than chemical ones.
1238 2018-04-08 21:19:47 Shut up you lier, Bastard.... Because of you people Earth is a Hel for us... Your support for occupiers like Saudi Arabia, Israel and India has shown your ugly faces bloody, Oil thirsty Americans
1239 2018-04-08 21:19:41 You’re not though.
1240 2018-04-08 21:19:24 No retailer should be stocking products that put the Antarctic Ocean at risk. @BootsUK as leading krill oil stockist, when will you step up and #ProtectAntarctic?

1243 2018-04-08 21:18:59 Warm water with lots of sea salt to bathe your skin and for exfoliation use a clean nail brush to gentle exfoliate black heads. I also find using sudo cream and an oil free moisturiser really helps. Clean towels to dry my face and not touching my skin has really helped too!x
1244 2018-04-08 21:18:52 Lots of countries have collapsing oil prices but their people are starving and fleeing  Norway for example, Canada   Sorry but you are either thick or ignorant
1245 2018-04-08 21:18:43 If we're allies why did we start a war that causes the deaths of over 1,000,000 people for oil?
1246 2018-04-08 21:18:37 I could be wrong but I think I was told Dodson’s motor broke an oil pump.
1247 2018-04-08 21:18:36 If you can profit from inflation and know when to invest in oil and when to invest in weapons manufacturers then the Trump presidency is a profitable one. If you’re in any way vulnerable though then good luck
1248 2018-04-08 21:18:14 This young man will be caught, deep fried in a vat of hot oil and served to our first hundred customers. #RexManningDay
1249 2018-04-08 21:18:07 I like soy, rice vinegar, and sesame seed oil. Sometimes sriracha for heat. Good for dim sum or dumplings.
1250 2018-04-08 21:18:04 It is a work in progress. Results are already coming in, there is no silver bullet to solve the economic problem. It is gradual to have a sustainable economy which works with or without high or low crude oil prices. It is half full not half empty.
1251 2018-04-08 21:17:57 One would think they would want to diversify of their own accord
Oil's days are numbered....they must know this
1252 2018-04-08 21:17:53 a blender curiously powered by coconut oil
1253 2018-04-08 21:17:36 Terrorist/jihadist reinforcements and arms were pouring in via Turkey for several years. When ISIS held oil fields, before Russia came to Syria, Turkey bought oil for $20/barrel, gold, artifacts, sold weapons. Russia colapsed income/supplies and from 10.2015 starts fall of jihad.
1254 2018-04-08 21:17:33 Careful some bad ju ju doing the rounds. I rinsed my nasal passages with salt water yesterday and taking anti inflammatories and olbas oil.  Barely touched it...
1255 2018-04-08 21:17:23 Trump: Go ahead and rip the Ameerican paxpayers off, just make sure you take care of the coal and oil industry
1256 2018-04-08 21:17:19 Gattuso’s #Milan, is a team ran out of oil. There’s no options on the bench (Montolivo, Locatelli, Borini). Meanwhile, #Gattuso also seems to be out of ideas, with a 3-3-4 formation, that handicaps play from the wings and creates confusion more than anything else. #MilanSassuolo
1257 2018-04-08 21:17:15 Oil is to water like Sunday at Augusta is to Rory.
1258 2018-04-08 21:17:13 Das like saying i don't like chicken with oil in it lmfao
1259 2018-04-08 21:17:02 I luv me sum cannabis oil 
1260 2018-04-08 21:16:37 1) you called me a donkey in your reply so not sure why you're trying to take the moral high ground now
2) US sending troops and exploiting regions for oil is not comparable to Israel
3) Israel regularly kills innocent civilians + participates in human rights abuses w US money
1261 2018-04-08 21:16:26 Getting my oil changed, new wipers and now just to vacuum out the car. Gotta get everything baby ready!
1262 2018-04-08 21:16:24 I know Jamie likes to put olive oil on EVERYTHING but it doesn’t work for me. I prefer good old sunflower oil.
1263 2018-04-08 21:16:21 She needs her oil checked
1264 2018-04-08 21:16:19 Adobo and olive oil - but very close!
1265 2018-04-08 21:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and then never left.
1266 2018-04-08 21:16:08 Get so paranoid turning off my oil literally check the switch like 3 or 4 times lmao
1267 2018-04-08 21:16:02 Oil change and physio tomorrow #goodbyepaycheque
1268 2018-04-08 21:15:56 Yep, the end results justify the means. Pruitt can spend all he wants but he doesn't get fired until Icon, Koch bros and big oil say so.
1269 2018-04-08 21:15:51 What is with cauliflower?? It is the new truffle oil. Way overused!!
1270 2018-04-08 21:15:45 Holika oil tint ค่ะ
1271 2018-04-08 21:15:43 RSO= “Rick Simpson Oil” should be able to find multiple MOM dispensaries with it; or look it up online to find a home remedy. Hope that helps. Cheers
1272 2018-04-08 21:15:31 Stalk-tacular!
1273 2018-04-08 21:15:27 The west has played the Russian  baloney card since after the 2nd world war. How about America cash interface with Canadian oil plus Al Gore etc visiting Wynne in Ontario. #alberta #liberal #cpc #upc #ndp

1277 2018-04-08 21:15:20 After looking so promising early Rory McIlroy is leaking oil now. #themasters2018
1278 2018-04-08 21:15:16 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
1279 2018-04-08 21:15:13 I prefer coconut oil. Used to use this though. It's great. But coconut oil is a step above.
1280 2018-04-08 21:15:12 Meaning people with TPS who still are from war zones like south sudan and can not go back, still have to go cause someone decided not to reniew their visa? Meanwhile digging oil in south sudan. U3oi are ore very ignorant or an odd humaniterian.
1281 2018-04-08 21:14:58 Whoa! Just a tiny splash of oil from that frying pan could prove fatal for that girl in the pic! 
1282 2018-04-08 21:14:53 I go through coconut oil so fast
1283 2018-04-08 21:14:24 crisps are worse than chocolate!! they have so much more oil in them than chocolate so it’s probably best to cut out them instead
1284 2018-04-08 21:14:22 Barbara Mandrell - The Midnight Oil
1285 2018-04-08 21:14:21 oops, just dropped oil on my shirt
1286 2018-04-08 21:14:08 Just think that these could be in Indianapolis and Lucas OIL
1287 2018-04-08 21:14:05 If allowed to open, the mines will do irreparable damage.  How are all Alaskans not rioting in the streets?  Wait until they start drilling for oil in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.
1288 2018-04-08 21:14:04 Oil in the water?
1289 2018-04-08 21:13:53 oooh, yes kween! i like to do a himalayan salt, epsom salt, baking soda, acv, and rose oil soak!
1290 2018-04-08 21:13:47 You, Ajamu, are a human with a brain, thank goodness! It's a proxy war, regime change, oil found in occupied Golan HeightsA certain country wants it. They provide NO EVIDENCE & the only winners of this attack are the terrorists and the west who want Assad out. Funny that...
1291 2018-04-08 21:13:34 Garlic salt and olive oil?

1293 2018-04-08 21:13:19 Maybe Nidal has shorted equity markets, or is long oil. LOL
1294 2018-04-08 21:13:13 Olbas oil is my saviour rn
1295 2018-04-08 21:13:12 And Reagan wasn’t tough - Oil had fallen from $59 to $17 a barrel. Oil funded the Russian economy, their military. You, me, and my Uncle Phil could have gone and torn down the wall ourselves. Reagan wasn’t tough. Republican baloney.
1296 2018-04-08 21:13:12 Blunts & hot oil treatments
1297 2018-04-08 21:13:02 Call me the Ghawar field cause I’m full of oil!!!!!!
1298 2018-04-08 21:12:45 Because some Russian Oil Tycoon gave a corrupt FIFA exec a briefcase full of cash 
1299 2018-04-08 21:12:22 itnaa oil paratho py bhee ni hotaa jitnaa garmio mai humry face py hota ha 
1300 2018-04-08 21:12:14 Nuclear winter, snake oil, fight or give up or cards against humanity
1301 2018-04-08 21:12:14 Seriously, what were you expecting them to say:
1. Our coach deployed us like an idiot
2. Compared to most other teams we don’t have enough good players
3. Could have used a freaking save once in a while during the early part of the season
4.  And so on
1302 2018-04-08 21:12:06 Slide oil.
1303 2018-04-08 21:12:03 If I want eggs, oil, and vinegar in my sandwich I'll just knock up a fried egg butty and put vinegar on it.
1304 2018-04-08 21:11:55 I'm seriously getting bored of the fake news. Why on earth would Assad want to attack his own people? This is all about Israel wanting Putin out of the way, Syria invaded, then they can get their hands on the Golan Heights as apparently it has more oil than in Saudi Arabia.
1305 2018-04-08 21:11:52 If I went to church I would stand up and say “No Way!”  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
1306 2018-04-08 21:11:50 You are right...  Done that before. Even dry garri mixed with red oil.
1307 2018-04-08 21:11:42 One doesn't always know where to get it, although hemp oil is available in Holland & Barret now
1308 2018-04-08 21:11:42 I’ve been in a deep emo funk all week so I’m dragging my sorry ass out of bed, cleaning my entire house, cleansing and scrubbing every inch of my physical and etheric bodies and lathering myself in lavender/lemongrass oil 
1309 2018-04-08 21:11:33 It's a terrible ad even to actually responsible gun owners. Bare metal on skin is a recipe to ruin your finish with oil/sweat, and how would she even draw it? The grip is on the wrong side to do a same side draw, but the angle is wrong for cross-arm too.
1310 2018-04-08 21:11:17 really wanna be back in Hawaii, lathered up in oil, in the sand 
1311 2018-04-08 21:11:10 Of cooking oil.
1312 2018-04-08 21:11:07 The overpass at Zac Lentz Parkway and SW Moody St will be closed for a few hours while VFD cleans up oil that leaked from the truck tractor and wreck debris.
1313 2018-04-08 21:11:06 And those figures exclude oil, which comes from an “unknown area” according to HMRC.
1314 2018-04-08 21:11:00 Would add some chili oil to it....
1315 2018-04-08 21:10:27 looks bad I guess. I couldn't even afford $50 a night, for long. All the Bushes are and plenty more are big oil men. thank heavens our president isn't.
1316 2018-04-08 21:10:21 ウルフもハイエナも事情があるんだって
1317 2018-04-08 21:10:12 Help please : I bought a big 16 oz jar of food grade organic coconut oil + was using it on brushing my dreads out but like I’m never gonna use all of it ... what else can I do with it ???? I don’t wanna cook if I’m like using it on my hair ?? Idk 
1318 2018-04-08 21:10:07 Endless oil story

1320 2018-04-08 21:10:06 RT @LivingSafely: #Kraft Italian Dressing this April? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
1321 2018-04-08 21:10:05 There are offerings for repentance (sin), surrender (burnt), ministry (grain+oil), & fellowship (peace).
Repentance+surrender+fellowship+ministry = Coming of the Glory of God.

1322 2018-04-08 21:09:51 They're in the same time zone you ninny. Unlike us and China. And China owns oil and gas exploration in Australasia as they haven't the capital to do it themselves.
1323 2018-04-08 21:09:45 Apparently WD-40 markets itself as "Penetration oil" and that worries me
1324 2018-04-08 21:09:44 I would have an oil painting of it done and hang it up over the mantle. 
1325 2018-04-08 21:09:39 Not only does Bucky have a vibranium arm, that mf got hella volume in his hair boyyyy. Fuckin uhhhh heart shaped erb oil in his locks.
1326 2018-04-08 21:09:36 WOMEN. Amen. classic .  Let's rock some psalms YAH is so amazing 7 FOREVER drones around me anointing oil saturated with with me know what seasonings and preps for soul
1327 2018-04-08 21:09:20 I can’t tell if you’re a shill or just get your news from American MSM. Assad’s gassing no one, even Mattis admitted this. Even if it was true that number is dwarfed by US/Saudi drone civilian kills. Saudi wants to cut out the oil sale by Russia to the UK and China.
1328 2018-04-08 21:09:16 Hi Bill, first - we're not an oil company - we don't drill for oil, we sell transport energy, mostly fossil fuels now, but we're not wedded to that. Our concern is reducing the effects of human activity, the rapid rise of carbon emissions in the industrial age, on our planet ^DZ
1329 2018-04-08 21:08:57 fine by me you dirty bitches can eat your oil infested onion filled sambusa 
adios!
1330 2018-04-08 21:08:46 I'll be workin hard like a golden glowing goddess but my face oil god bless tha bees .
1331 2018-04-08 21:08:42 Hahaha... That's cray. Na to look for driller as we won discover oil naa...
1332 2018-04-08 21:08:32 Everyone's been raving about extra virgin olive oil for hair growth... at first I was like o.O but now I'm tempted to try it. Gettin' desperate to have longer hair.
1333 2018-04-08 21:08:28 Putting peppermint oil on your scalp literally feels so good!
1334 2018-04-08 21:07:56 Oil yacho yakusvuura gwendo guno
1335 2018-04-08 21:07:46 Hmmm...looking for a BoB who makes face oil that doesn't contain coconut oil...browsing...
1336 2018-04-08 21:07:45 Jo malone bath oil makes me far too happy, literally is the little things  x
1337 2018-04-08 21:07:30 Hot oil treatments cool until you have oil everyfuckingwhere
1338 2018-04-08 21:07:13 Owowow- some oil splashed onto my hand q x q
1339 2018-04-08 21:07:13 To make peace: 1) oil & water do NOT mix. 2) The oil/sand deposits in earth 1000+ yrs & every rain for 1000's of yrs, water drains through the mix & into the lakes & streams. Unless  millions of barrel's leak directly into waters, such as Horizon spill, impact negligible. @USDOI
1340 2018-04-08 21:07:09 Had to google him. Phrases like “Snake oil salesman” and “Sucker born every minute” came to mind.
He really hasn’t Done anything has he?
1341 2018-04-08 21:07:08 True!!! I only want nya sesame oil on my fried rice, gyoza or chicken. Mabango sa pan! Haha!
1342 2018-04-08 21:07:02 Is it a real opposition to the oil pipeline, or is it an attempt to get more from the protest backers than they can get from the oil companies. It’s a shame that it’s really hard to tell heart felt beliefs versus paid for obstructionism from foreign competitors.
1343 2018-04-08 21:06:57 k gotta whip the hell out em next 
time and use a lil more oil 
1344 2018-04-08 21:06:56 Robyn, I respect your right to your beliefs. Most however know for a fact that pipelines are the safest and most reliable way of moving oil products to refineries and ports. I assume you really try to limit your use of oil based products given how dangerous you believe them to be
1345 2018-04-08 21:06:48 It's crazy how much oil is seeping out of the ground there. That's why forest fires last so long there they burn underground for months. I lived through 2 fires there and that was enough for me lol. The last one took everything but I still love Fort Mcmurray.
1346 2018-04-08 21:06:40 Gym, oil change, a little shopping, grocery shopping, and now Netflix. What a good Sunday! 
1347 2018-04-08 21:06:39 If you strike and take out Assad, I swear I’ll vote for you inspite of Russia meddling, stormy Daniels, no tax returns, stupid tax cuts, etc. Take out this murderous thug and make evil Putin pay a huge price. Crash oil and gas prices, Russia will be back to food line.
1348 2018-04-08 21:06:28 It wasn't socialism that did for Venezuela, it was an over reliance on oil, interference from USA and some corrupt people.

Sorry, in your previous tweet, did you mean 'others' as in other people (from Cuba), I took it to mean other countries
1349 2018-04-08 21:06:27 "i give Mcfly noogies, he dips a POOR WEEPING SHOE in BOILING OIL, and I'M the bad guy!"

1350 2018-04-08 21:06:21 He’s rockin the ear tags so I think he’s tame.  I hear he likes cigars and people who max out on the fish oil supplements.
1351 2018-04-08 21:06:19 Maybe we want to play baseball with our kids in Nova Scotia without breathing in  toxic Corexit wafting off our shores from Sable Island after BP's guaranteed oil spill here!!! Thanks!!! @RobinTress @MarkButlerEAC
1352 2018-04-08 21:06:13 FECO- Full Extract Cannabis Oil has cured many many "terminal patients"
1353 2018-04-08 21:06:04 I hate studying... I’ll be reading about bioremediation of oil spills and then I’ll end up curious about bioremediation of nuclear waste which turns into me looking at pictures of Chernobyl.... 
1354 2018-04-08 21:06:04 See I told you that Cantu lol. . yeah 3 not so bad I put like 4 but all natural no flake .. And there all from taliah waajid besides the anti itch tea tree oil scalp drops .. Ok last hair ? Lmao . what in your opion helps the curls the most out of all the products ?

1356 2018-04-08 21:05:51 Russian ruble went up with oil prices.. oil drove both, growth and currency.. all else held equal, stronger currency tightens financial conditions
1357 2018-04-08 21:05:50 No problem. I've had acne my whole life. I still have it. I can't wear anything on my face. I can't use anything with oil in it. It sucks. I hope 6oy find sowmthing that works well. It took me a long time.
1358 2018-04-08 21:05:49 Pruitt part of the GOP/RNC' scorched earth policy. Represent big oil ONLY. Have no concept of pollution controls. Pruitt will tear apart all needed EPA policies. Neo Nazis, kkkults, NEO ROBBER BARONS.
1359 2018-04-08 21:05:47 All you need is coconut oil and baking soda.
1360 2018-04-08 21:05:40 Story time: i was pouring a customer chili oil for her sushi and the lid came off of the chili oil and it splashed all over my clothes and in my eye and i couldn’t see and it felt like pepper spray and my coworker poured milk in my eye so that’s how my days going
1361 2018-04-08 21:05:34 I got an oil change, new tires, a car wash and I cleaned out my shit. A productive Sunday.

1363 2018-04-08 21:05:06  oh right  after the oil money has gone .......
1364 2018-04-08 21:05:05 Before going keto, I didn't cook nearly as much. I even do meal prep. A real housewife 

Tonight (and tomorrow's lunch) was chicken marinated in olive oil, slt/ppr/oregano. Cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, olives, fresh spinach, grana padano, butter, heavy cream.
1365 2018-04-08 21:05:03 I’m gonna burn the midnight oil then #LRT
1366 2018-04-08 21:04:52 Please listen we are being deceived to justify the regime change in Syria & install a IMF/Rothschild bank.  W/O NWO in every country, they cannot initiate a one world monetary system.  We already have people in there for the oil.  This is the truth. Assad is not killing people.
1367 2018-04-08 21:04:36 Philthy Phil....God bless....but what a shit show that whole event was.  If I wanted a mud race I’d go to a Lucas oil moto....
1368 2018-04-08 21:04:31 Yes, palm oil
1369 2018-04-08 21:04:22 Hot olive oil.
1370 2018-04-08 21:04:22 Yes,invest in oil while residents of Port Harcourt die of sooth inhalation.Oh I forgot,your president did not know and has not heard.
1371 2018-04-08 21:04:18 @FullFrontalSamB To answer your question; you sound ignorant, self aggrandising, and communist in rants. The TBS network that you are on is a money grubbing snake oil sales pit who downs America and it's principles.
1372 2018-04-08 21:04:17 i love oil x x x
1373 2018-04-08 21:03:28 Today I try oil pulling for a month 
1374 2018-04-08 21:03:15 I always feel like an alchemist when I need to mix my essential oils for my oil cleanser
1375 2018-04-08 21:03:13 ADDICTION!!!!

IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT MY CBD OIL HAS HELPED TO CONTROL URGES!!!  COMMENT FOR MORE INFORMATION.
1376 2018-04-08 21:03:11 Soybean oil and dandelion to be specific.
The 'eco-friendly' alternative to mineral oil.
Continental say production starts somewhere in the mect decade.
I would provide a link but that's all German language.
1377 2018-04-08 21:02:53 @StocktonWTF changed the oil in 2 cars and mowed the lawn. Productive Sunday
1378 2018-04-08 21:02:31 you own this farm ,russian bear and lion feed them before thay eat your oil in middle east

1384 2018-04-08 21:01:54 Thank you. I do find the whole Syria thing confusing. 

I know the West interfered in the other Arab spring uprisings with probably no success but Syria was mainly left alone. I'd assumed it lack sufficient oil for them to bother with.
1385 2018-04-08 21:01:39 @marklevinshow big new merger soon oil and coal are going to build oil extraction from coal plants . gives USA 41% more supply and is easy to do with no drilling less regulation.

1395 2018-04-08 21:00:13 April 08, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1396 2018-04-08 21:00:10 Coal, meat, natural gas, oil, logging – NONE of them would be in the black if they actually had to pay for the destruction they cause.
1397 2018-04-08 21:00:07 You say "saving USA Billions of Dollars" but surely you mean, ruining the water system for our future, allowing oil to be spilled across our land, not helping #FlintWaterCrisis and caring more about industries, his friends and money more than the environment.
1398 2018-04-08 21:00:06 A combination of lavender, peppermint, and lemon essential oils can be wonderfully therapeutic for instant allergy relief. Lavender is a natural antihistamine, peppermint helps to open up airways and capillaries, and lemon essential oil helps to thin mucus and flush out toxins.

Marine life need krill to survive. HUMANS DON’T. Do the right thing. #conservation #marinereserve #wildlife
1411 2018-04-08 20:57:56 If supremacy is so real, why are Big oil companies and the govt. anti dumping laws for Korea and China totally screwing me over right now? I’m white, they are white. We make cheap furniture for middle class for middle class families? Why Are the supremely impressing me?
1412 2018-04-08 20:57:37 @realDonaldTrump Give 24 hrs notice to abandon all air fields in Syria then render them useless. Enact an immediate oil embargo against Syria, Russia and Iran. We know you will have the appropriate response.
1413 2018-04-08 20:57:32 Which oil company was called out by name?  Find it.  Having a discussion about the need for change in energy strategies because 1) oil is a limited resource and will once be gone and  2) it is polluting our world,  is very different than calling out a specific business.

If models like @EvangelineLilly said they tried air perculators of #italianseasoning & #sesame seed oil or lemon grass for emotions, I too would choose organic.
1417 2018-04-08 20:56:38 Taking out Blood to take out Oil, never been a good idea. It must stop !
1418 2018-04-08 20:56:18 Take A Tablespoon of Coconut Oil A Day. It contains lauric acid, our bodies naturally converts it into monolaurin which fights viruses and bacteria that causes HERPES, INFLUENZA, HIV, AND CYTOMEGALOVIRUS!!
1419 2018-04-08 20:56:17 How you know Assad did this? Do you have numerous stocks in gas,oil and defence?   Maybe that's why you know. War rises oil prices. Were not all stupid. Please tell me i'm wrong and you own no stocks.
1420 2018-04-08 20:55:48 You might as well live in Venezuela where the animals starve in the zoo, no functioning internal economy, state oil company production halved because yes they are that incompetent. The only thing they are long is blowhards who blame capitalists for their ills.

1423 2018-04-08 20:55:33 Want YOUR extensions to last longer? Don't put mascara on them.  got make up on them? Clean it off real quick! 
If you let eyeliner, mascara, eyeshadow, dirt and oil build up on your natural lashes and extensions it can cause poor retention and cause bacteria to grow
1424 2018-04-08 20:55:14 Let’s compare South Africa with Saudi Arabia because they both have large natural resources reserves.

- Roughly 70% of platinum comes from South Africa
- Saudi Arabia has 22% of world’s oil reserves

South Africa’s mining industry is privatized & state owns oil company in Saudi

1429 2018-04-08 20:54:47 Garlic, onion, clove oil and whiskey are good topical treatments. I'd do 400mg aspirin with 400mg ibuprofen every 4-6 hours.  Also, if its infected lay on a bed with your head hanging upside down and backwards off the edge and see if you can get the fluid to shift off the nerve.

1431 2018-04-08 20:54:28 Good Afternoon Mr. President! Thank you for freeing up our domestic oil capabilities. It's a very important card to hold during your negotiations. I'm sure you are more than aware that every barrel pumped by the US is a barrel taken away from Russia/Iran. Directly weakening them.
1432 2018-04-08 20:54:22 Not to be heartless but America doesn’t need to flip the bill for this one we fix everyone elses problems but our own and get nothing in return I want oil I want our debt paid! it’s disgusting and tragic but other countries need to act as well

1439 2018-04-08 20:53:16 Really interesting article! Do you by any chance know why the researchers chose to specifically use cancer cells? Also, I know these adverse affects are seen with direct application of the oils to the skin but what about diffusion with an oil diffuser?
1440 2018-04-08 20:53:15 Put some arnica oil on my ankle and the warm glow makes me wonder, if I cover my whole body in it, is that what that "spooning" thing feels like?
1441 2018-04-08 20:53:07 Bloodsuckers, they're family because of oil, crown prince of Saudi Arabia owns the oil and Bush families own Taxes oil and Saudi too.

1443 2018-04-08 20:53:00 We have basically the equivalent in the US, I haven't done it because I was just pulling things out of my fridge. Also, I'm only frying in olive oil and that might be a bit weird.
1444 2018-04-08 20:52:58 Girls y’all are gorgeous as you are  bio oil is good on stretch marks but just be careful what clothes you wear when you have it on because the oil can stain some materials  and any decent cocoa or coconut butter is really good too. Also any creams high in vitamin C

1453 2018-04-08 20:51:33 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

1463 2018-04-08 20:50:23 You choose! Can't have both! Must act NOW!No-one likes to be bullied, but even the finance firms that facilitate the flow of Iranian oil to Europe and Asia would be mightily brave to ignore the threat.The precedent under Barack Obama shows how it could play out

But these wars are asymmetric - millions of muslims killed vs a thousand of USA/ UK killed. He perceives this as unjust war against all muslims.
1479 2018-04-08 20:48:04 Trump is correct. dictators don't like a strong democratic president, although some anti-military countries (like canada) wear white ties.i ask why syrian oil wells have not been obliterated?hit assad where it hurts..
1480 2018-04-08 20:48:04 They all have to prop up each other's Religion of Oil talking-points. We're not going to be out of oil tomorrow, next month, next year, or even decades from now, but surely the industry can handle a study with courage.
1481 2018-04-08 20:48:02 It's about gosh-darned time somebody called out the guy who took away habeas corpus, pardoned Cheney, bailed out banks on the backs of poor and working Americans, started NEW wars, leaving countries in shambles just so Exxon-Mobil could get the oil. No Santa

1513 2018-04-08 20:43:52 Actually, a more correct view is that currencies are priced in oil.  The question is:  If fossil fuels fade from energy dominance, how will currencies be priced in the future?  On the amount of wind and sun available to the issuer?  #sarcasm #punny
1514 2018-04-08 20:43:46 And the oil russians and US companies.

1520 2018-04-08 20:43:18 This spin is so bad, I’m surprised it got released at all.
1521 2018-04-08 20:42:59 I now understand why women don’t go to school and get an oil field husband. Sign me up
1522 2018-04-08 20:42:47 I feel so accomplished I changed my oil in my truck by myself #itsthelittlethings
1523 2018-04-08 20:42:34 How the fuck do I get Snow White seeds, oil, or weed?
1524 2018-04-08 20:42:33 The whole ‘no apology you just didn’t hear me correctly’ apology from a snake oil salesman is crap
1525 2018-04-08 20:42:32 Don’t say you weren’t warned when you have marshmallow glue all over your kitchen. Like I say - lots of coconut oil required!
1526 2018-04-08 20:42:25 Name any oil company.
1527 2018-04-08 20:42:15 Assad has no reason to gas his own people. In fact, it would be the worst possible move he could make. The rebels have everything to gain from it, however. Don't forget this whole conflict was initially about oil and natural gas, and a proxy war between the US and Russia.
1528 2018-04-08 20:42:14 Pita+Hummus = Chole + kulche with extra oil and butter and spices)
So kanji kinds strong breakfast + Idli + a Nice daal+ green veggies lunch with rasam and a bowl of curd + Dinner with tiffin + fruits makes up for a easy no allergy, very easily digestible routine.
1529 2018-04-08 20:42:12 Yes....in their own way turned out to be no different than big oil
       ...bullshiting themselves first. Us second.
       (Why didn't Ben & Jerrys go the way Facebook did?)
1530 2018-04-08 20:42:12 Veggie, rice, roasted chicken, olive oil vinegar and curry sauce and chocolate cake!!
1531 2018-04-08 20:42:03 Just made popcorn, using ghee as the cooking oil. Then I poured over melted butter and added a little Vulcan's Fire Salt and parmesan. It is SO GOOD.
1532 2018-04-08 20:42:00 my crayons, oil pastels & water colors are ready! 

kulayan na natin to! 
1533 2018-04-08 20:41:50 On the bright side, Charley Hoffman just put $1000 in my pocket with a hole in one.  @TheMasters
1534 2018-04-08 20:41:49 nothing wrong with that
1535 2018-04-08 20:41:26 which they themselves created with their pollution of our drinking water  and oil spills into our food sources, the saltmarshes.
1536 2018-04-08 20:41:21 I took a leap and bought some fragrant oil that's meant to smell like Mollymauk. I'm so ready.
1537 2018-04-08 20:41:10 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
1538 2018-04-08 20:41:08 Get some cannabis CBD oil when you arrive and micro dose until the effects/nausea fades
1539 2018-04-08 20:41:01 Not only insecure about oil futures, but a megalomaniac with delusions of grandeur. And btw, your slavish sycophanty of corporate culture is the essence of fascism. You seek to impose your will outside of democratic processes and norms.
1540 2018-04-08 20:40:38 First tweet
1541 2018-04-08 20:40:37 Argan oil is my favorite
1542 2018-04-08 20:40:28 Ha! Better check and make sure it's oil and not "sauce"....
1543 2018-04-08 20:40:26 あいて…ちょっとエルザにスリーサイズ聞いただけなのに殴られた…
1544 2018-04-08 20:40:10 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。
1545 2018-04-08 20:40:08 would love to be part of an all female art show tbh I’m so tired of oil painting portraits of famous people and men that think television is still the worst thing that ever happened to humanity
1546 2018-04-08 20:40:07 We NEED to start putting our focus on America’s resources instead of meddling in other countries. All the oil we need can be found on our own soil #AlaskanGas #jcpmc
1547 2018-04-08 20:40:05 Hard to pick a group of bigger losers for Sunday betting at The Masters than Kuchar, Kim, Wiesberger, and Fleetwood.  Surprised I didn't choose loser Leishman too.  In an anti Draft Kings world, I just won a million.  Augusta should ban these losers.  @TheMasters
1548 2018-04-08 20:40:04 This is a source of unlimited energy cheaper than coal with no carbon footprint. It will directly replace all fossil fuel 78 times cheaper than coal, 127 times cheaper than natural gas and 204 times cheaper than oil #TheHydrogenSolution
1549 2018-04-08 20:39:57 fun day here, got lost behind my lens in the back streets and stumbled onto an artisan market. So different from the stalls I used to visit here in Manchester, no more bags of broken biscuits, it's all beard oil and salted caramel bakewell tart fusion.
1550 2018-04-08 20:39:36 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1551 2018-04-08 20:39:27 Why not get the hell of there ? It would be one thing if we were actually there to saves lives and bring peace , but no one buying that as the reason we are there . War profiteering and serving oil/gas interest  . It's shameful what we do there and to our country -in the process
1552 2018-04-08 20:39:12 Why I can be a pain to DM sometimes:
Hey, so as there is a fire there, can I throw one of my flasks of oil at the flaming sphere to crate an explosion at the werespiders? I have no idea what the rules are on this, if any; sorry for you to have to come up with those on the spot...
1553 2018-04-08 20:39:08 Just saw this dude @Bease11 on a oil chang billboard. Hook ya boy up wit a free oil change pops !
1554 2018-04-08 20:39:07 no no, Tommy give him what he wants. Oil money had nothing to do with it. Absolutely nothing. City’s success would have happened without the takeover, for certain, no doubt.
1555 2018-04-08 20:38:58 pleeeeease. the mr wants some beard stuff so I'll get everything once the glow oil becomes available tomorrow
1556 2018-04-08 20:38:43 They did bring some, but the truffle oil has all been claimed!
1557 2018-04-08 20:38:42 I feel like maybe you can even make an argument that she probably exacerbated it with the oil and salt cleanse
1558 2018-04-08 20:38:37 A ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the sinking of minesweeper #HMNZSMoa was held at Tulagi Harbour, Solomon Islands. Moa was sunk by Japanese dive bombers whilst refuelling from a US oil barge in the harbour on 7 April 1943. 5 sailors lost their lives & 18 were wounded.
1559 2018-04-08 20:38:36 It’s very sticky though. You need lots of coconut oil to work with it. Better to just buy it from sainsbos.
1560 2018-04-08 20:38:29 Sinew strings + blood fretboard oil
1561 2018-04-08 20:38:19 Do not get peppermint oil in the corner of your eye.
1562 2018-04-08 20:38:15 HEH ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) YAAA! Redjuice one I use the sai brush(?) and the oil one for textures UωU u should check the clip site (?) app thing you can dl brushes from diff creators I got some nice pencil ones 
1563 2018-04-08 20:38:11 The center of this story may not be as simple as 'villainous oil companies,' or #scicomm deficit, but the conflicting emotions of individuals faced with specific decisions in the absence of a familiar social contract.
1564 2018-04-08 20:37:25 He must have been standing in the way of US GOV oil forces!
1565 2018-04-08 20:37:21 Interesting string of events
1. Saudis glaringly absent in China oil futs basket
2. In unforseen event they raise price of oil to China
3. Sign MOUs w/ $FTI & $HON to enable multi B $ petrochem investmts in TX
4. Announce double cap. expansion of Motiva in TX
#PetroYuan?
1566 2018-04-08 20:37:16 no take cbd oil
1567 2018-04-08 20:37:08 They knew the chemical composition of their products. They could see the damage, residue in the plants and on their vehicles including transport / ling haul ones. Regulators were slow. Who knew oil was a bad heating agent?
1568 2018-04-08 20:37:05 @Chrysler looks like I will not be purchasing another of your vehicles. My 2010 Town and Country has been nothing but problems for years. Now my dash lights, wipers and locks are going crazy. Not to mention the "normal" consumption of oil @ 1qt per 750 miles.
1569 2018-04-08 20:36:52 Hell rules because you can do whatever you want there! Go to hell!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil! Who will win the War 4 Water!
1570 2018-04-08 20:36:50 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! null
1571 2018-04-08 20:36:50 I love thayers which hazel (I use the rose petal one) and primrose oil. also change your pillow case out often. it helps.
1572 2018-04-08 20:36:44 He still wants us to take the oil. Another war crime.
1573 2018-04-08 20:36:43 Midterms and Mueller.  How anyone believed he was anything more than a snake oil salesman is troubling.
1574 2018-04-08 20:36:24 I haven’t been following Israeli policy, but containment makes much more sense.  So who benefits from destabilizing Syria?  I think Russia.  Refugees put pressure on Europe, and Russia’s involvement allows them to grab territory & influence over matters crucial to oil pipelines.
1575 2018-04-08 20:36:18 The following PGA players at Masters Augusta National totally suck, lacking guts, ability, or any sense of manhood: Matt Kuchar, Tommy Fleetwood, Wi So Kim, and Wiesberger.  Superfecta of losers.  Should find another sport, maybe curling.  @TheMasters
1576 2018-04-08 20:36:15 Don't be so sure. If the oil fields don't seem like they can be secured. The neocon deep state won't lift a finger for their proxy mercenaries.

At the moment they can't connect Omar oil fields to Jordan or Turkey, and with a land route, it's useless.
1577 2018-04-08 20:35:56 There's so many stories of players getting burned by snake oil salesmen. Hell, how many big-business guys and CEOs got burned by Bernie Madoff? Professional conmen.
1578 2018-04-08 20:35:56 Oh you believe no raw sewage is dumped in to Albert water? It's just not in the leftist scipt. Keep on supporting foreign oil.
1579 2018-04-08 20:35:54 i grew up in the area he represents. oklahoma is a very poor state. running for office takes money and time. the only people who have those two things are oil men and insurance company owners. and those people tend to be the most extreme conservatives.
1580 2018-04-08 20:35:51 USA lobbyist-run govt: Assad is killing innocent Syrians! We must invade, bomb, set up bases where all the oil is, just by coincidence.
USA lobbyist-run govt: Israel is slaughtering innocent Palestinians! Israel helps our war profiteers, so ignore it.

I hope this empire falls.
1581 2018-04-08 20:35:30 I bet John Bolton is hinting regime change in Syria. Just like Iraq. Oil. CIA?
1582 2018-04-08 20:35:27 Went to a presentation yesterday with a leader in the world of Neuroscience and he spoke on mold toxicity and the studies they have done using Thieves oil. He said that they were amazed at how the air quality with mold spores improved almost instantly when Thieves was diffused.
1583 2018-04-08 20:35:25 /That's/ what we forgot, more cooking oil!
1584 2018-04-08 20:35:24 Oh.. sure, I'll take a pound. Gotta soak up some oil in my driveway
1585 2018-04-08 20:35:12 In pan 1: two diced chicken breasts, cubed chorizo, diced courgette and red pepper, sliced mushrooms. Sauté in oil, plus garlic, oregano, S&P, tomato purée, and chopped tomatoes.
Pan 2: cup and a half of rice, and diced onion. Sauté with butter, then add a cup of wine...
1586 2018-04-08 20:35:10 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
1587 2018-04-08 20:35:07 This chicharron looks too white tho. I like mine being fried in that musty oil to give it color and flavor lmao
1588 2018-04-08 20:35:03 Just say this dude @Bease11 on a oil chang billboard. Hook ya boy up wit a free oil change pops !
1589 2018-04-08 20:34:54 Looks like got oil in your engine how about me gasing u up!!÷!
1590 2018-04-08 20:34:37 I just saw video. Have been using CBD oil for joint pain. Never heard of it for skincare. Will you be talking about it when it comes out for that purpose?
1591 2018-04-08 20:34:29 I realize that our need to import oil has an adverse impact on what we pay. We were still importing oil when it was $120/ barrel and yet we are paying more at the pump with it being $75/ barrel. That little discrepancy is what I’m asking about.
1592 2018-04-08 20:34:17 We are moving at a snail's pace, people are thinking of post oil era but my country has not even finish handling refining oil
1593 2018-04-08 20:34:01 I use:

• Boscia Purifying Gel Cleanser

• Bioesscence Squalane + Vitamin C Rose Oil 

and I’ve been eyeing FRESH Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner... I don’t currently use a toner.
1594 2018-04-08 20:33:53 tea tree oil & cocoa butter 
1595 2018-04-08 20:33:48 most of those wars are about stealing oil from the indigenous peoples anway.  The rest is just a flimsy pretext.
1596 2018-04-08 20:33:40 I love the smell of moroccan oil
1597 2018-04-08 20:33:29 Came home to a full tank, oil change, & clean car.....what a blessing 
1598 2018-04-08 20:33:16 Heirloom tomatoes. Fresh mozzarella. Balsamic reduction and basil oil. Best snack ever
1599 2018-04-08 20:33:14 Oh naah
We get sponsors 
We get Russian Oil money 
We also get illegal Russian money
1600 2018-04-08 20:33:13 So this is the mica powder that they use in body glimmers and oils like body lava. The "Oxiddes" they talk about in the ingredients are essentially micas of different colors 

so you can add this to any oil or lotions and experiment with levels of shimmer and colors.
1601 2018-04-08 20:33:12 Oh I love SEsame oil. I just bought some more recently. And spicy stuff.
1602 2018-04-08 20:33:05 Pre shampoo  it with oil and leave- in-conditioner.
1603 2018-04-08 20:33:00 Now there a gaddamn consulate 2 miles from me honey potting oil execs for drilling tech.
1604 2018-04-08 20:32:50 You can make/get it without dairy too if you lactose intolerant. Coconut oil instead of butter.
1605 2018-04-08 20:32:40 Are you serious?
1606 2018-04-08 20:32:34 I never use dove soap because palm oil forest havd decimated the orangutan population and destroyed half ghd forests in Borneo
1607 2018-04-08 20:32:26 My parents been , and they said it was beautiful. They even got anointing oil.
1608 2018-04-08 20:32:20 My perfume smells the way you'd imagine an extravagantly expensive 1800's New Orleans whorehouse would. It's called Snake Oil. You should check it out sometime, on me.
1609 2018-04-08 20:31:34 But his race car in New Zealand uses oil.

1611 2018-04-08 20:31:13 The only thing Real Americans and Patriots alike will rally behind is a March against the war in Syria. No more blood for oil
1612 2018-04-08 20:31:09 Take fish oil
1613 2018-04-08 20:30:52 Oil off the coast of Florida it's also exempt privilege and nepotism Rears it's ugly head
1614 2018-04-08 20:30:46 Hemlock Spruce essential oil and a packet on business development #whatsinneesyspurse
1615 2018-04-08 20:30:46 And how does Russia benefit from Euro refugee problem? Potentially destabilizing one of their primary oil markets. Which is the very reason they want to protect the territorial integrity of Syria. What is the strategic interest in using chem weapons?
1616 2018-04-08 20:30:35 There's mustard in there. It's lactofree cheese, not fake cheese. The coconut oil substitutes never taste right.
1617 2018-04-08 20:30:33 needless to say we are out of kakuni buns and olive oil i am ready for my new job!!!!!!!
1618 2018-04-08 20:30:30 Why would anyone be taken in by this man. He has snake oil salesman written all over him.
1619 2018-04-08 20:30:29 Last night I dreamed I was a spy escaping from Russians, and I threw them off my identity by swearing at them in French which was  effective. Then I realized I was actually @ShawkatAlia. Also there was a hotel on an oil rig or smthg, idk. (Alia, hmu I got a franchise for you.)
1620 2018-04-08 20:30:19 The palm leaves have been harvested and the oil gathered for Zahra Al-Zahra's burial ritual. This beautiful ceremony to celebrate a beloved poet and martyr should be witnessed by all, and thus the people of Zaharia invite you to partake in our heritage on Aug. 17. #FromTheAshes
1621 2018-04-08 20:30:16 Jojoba oil is by far one of my favorites ... if I’m home you can bet my face is greased the fuck up lmao

1623 2018-04-08 20:30:14 There’s more justification for smart cities, esp for Huawei which sells networks direct to governments. 

Specific telcos may have local vertical specialisms, but they are exceptions & atypical

No reason for e.g an oil company to have broad strategic relationships with telcos
1624 2018-04-08 20:30:05 To select a healthy cooking oil, look for expeller- pressed or cold-pressed oils to ensure you are buying high-quality, undamaged oil. Oi...

1630 2018-04-08 20:28:59 I need someone to massage my scalp with some oil. These braids are tight 
1631 2018-04-08 20:28:50 I used to use proactive and it’s just not worth it. I use cetaphil soap bar and literally just coconut oil on my skin and my scars always go away
1632 2018-04-08 20:28:47 I agree also. But they must invest carefully. In the 80s Norway saved billions from North Sea oil and used it to have cheap taxes etc to this present day. Enjoy it while it's here. 
1633 2018-04-08 20:28:34 Dnešní náhodné setkání s Charlie Hdcp. U Robin oil v Klatovy

1636 2018-04-08 20:27:53 He is a snake oil salesman. Why people turn to douchebags like him for life help/advice is beyond me.
1637 2018-04-08 20:27:40 acure is available through amazon and grove, but also sprouts has it down here so maybe fresh thyme? also rosehip oil is great for scarring/blemishes and argan oil is the only thing i put in my hair anymore so they're versatile!!
1638 2018-04-08 20:27:29 Would you rather we didn't? Because all you lot ever say is "oil money" "bought the League" etc...can you now see how fucking clueless your fan base is? You've just actually exposed them all. Well done fella. 
1639 2018-04-08 20:27:29 Hype..not buying the snake oil!!
1640 2018-04-08 20:27:24 Manage to teak oil the table today. Another job done for the summer

1643 2018-04-08 20:27:07 Was supposed to do laundry, get an oil change, go walk my dog, grocery shop and here I am hammered at 2:27 pm
1644 2018-04-08 20:27:02 ...feeble attempt at convincing viewers Pruitt has the support of anyone other than the oil & gas industry demonstrates either astonishing stupidity or naivety that’s now the trademark of the GOP. But worst of all, Todd sat there like a good little GOP doobie, instead of.../2
1645 2018-04-08 20:26:35 Neither is engine oil.
1646 2018-04-08 20:26:34 The Left - listens to scientists and people that know what the fuck they are talking about. The Right - doesn’t give a fuck about the environment and is selling our future to interest of big oil and dirty energy.
1647 2018-04-08 20:26:31 The US doesnt want to remove Assad to put him on trial for human rights. They want to kill Assad & put in thier own puppet so a oil pipeline can be built and to help Israel & Saudi Arabia. It matters how these leaders are removed from power.
1648 2018-04-08 20:26:26 Now is the time to act or shut up. Assad and the murderous Sponsor Putin must pay a huge cost for this act of genocide. No matter whatever role they played in our election, let’s rise up and teach these crooks a lesson . Crash oil& gas prices, and Putin is toast.
1649 2018-04-08 20:26:11 is bio oil actually effective ?
1650 2018-04-08 20:25:54 Just put on Hawaiian tanning oil and the first song that plays on my phone is from Moana... coincidence?

1663 2018-04-08 20:24:36 Your Tweet would actually make sense if it wasn't China that got most of Iraq's oil. The Iraqi War was not about oil but about destabilizing the territory for Israel's gain.

1676 2018-04-08 20:22:31 I’m a little confused by word that Oil used $0 LTIR.

Sekera missed almost half the season and there were others out for extended blocks of time (ie. RNH, Talbot, Larsson).

Why would that not be used? Can it accumulate and carry forward?

1679 2018-04-08 20:22:19 1/3 I read this with profound grief, the military logistics leadership in the last 20 years has done away with several programs, like the JOAP, joint oil analysts program, which paid for itself with one hit that saved a plane and possible a pilot. Cuts $250k vs $25 M for plane.
1680 2018-04-08 20:22:00 Now is your time to send a message to Assad. If you hit him hard. I’ll vote for you if not you are a coward. Remember “cowards are brave men”. Crash the price of oil & gas and send Russia back to a 3 rd world economy.

1727 2018-04-08 20:15:19 It'd get worse. The Saudis are behind this, they're hell bent on ousting Assad for the sake of oil/gas pipelines-which Assad said "No" to. 
The Saudis are FAR worse than Assad ever was. It makes NO sense for Assad to gas ppl AFTER @realDonaldTrump expressed a wish to leave Syria.

1734 2018-04-08 20:13:15 Many of those don't make any sense. Why would so many states be importing crude oil when only a few of them actually have refineries to make petroleum products?  New York's top import and export is diamonds?  That's is a luxury item not a necessity, so that makes no sense...

1746 2018-04-08 20:11:23 What the fuck are the outsiders doing there anyway? Even if Assad raped everyone personally in Syria , what the fuck business is it of the US? Granted vaseline is made of petroleum so they'd want to protect the oil at all costs, Ill find a better example

1751 2018-04-08 20:10:12 My theory: Theresa May, who is on the Saudis PAYROLL, is sheltering Saudi ISIS fighters in London while they wait for a full scale war in Syria, 
(for oil/gas pipelines). Saudis don't take (ISIS fighters), aka "refugees" so pays England, Germany, etc.. to house them.

Are you telling me that he wouldn't have been able to sustain his shitty economy unless the price of oil always rose dramatically? No, the reason why it went to shit is because socialism always fails.

1761 2018-04-08 20:08:38 I dont get it. Engine oil is toxic. 
It would be better for the environment to keep it in the engine. Or burn it in the engine. Rather than let it in to the air.

Obama's kicking credentialed reporters off the plane?
Hillary's getting a ardon from FBI Director for espionage act violations?
1775 2018-04-08 20:05:19 Absolutely. It is about oil, power and leverage. Putin's interest in maintaining Russia's power via their oil supply to Europe is what keeps him from abandoning Assad to the US war machine. The US in turn targets Russia with a massive propaganda campaign.

1789 2018-04-08 20:03:25 Yes, the Louisiana Governor sits on the Board of OPEC and if he gets in a cranky mood, he lowers the price of oil, if Tangipahoa high school football wins Friday nite he increases the price of oil. The republican talking points and their political tribalism are on steroids

1791 2018-04-08 20:03:19 May be we should be more realistic, what we have done in the past 7 years and still doing, it is exceptional. With this budget, and these players. We don't have oil Shaikh, Russian Mafia or support from European bank (real and Barca). Forza juve
1792 2018-04-08 20:03:16 Why is my oil change this much
1793 2018-04-08 20:03:07 Listen maaaaate, my body is not okay rn. Physically, nothing’s pretty. Ngidinga iArnica oil massage, wow 
1794 2018-04-08 20:03:07 Running with the tool metaphor, if we took away all the wrenches, people would still change their own oil, but it would be a major pain in the ass, so a few would give up, statisticly. We can't stop murder, but we don't have to make it super convenient.

1800 2018-04-08 20:02:40 I’m offended at myself. Took my car to get an oil change and car wash and forgot to put cash in my wallet to tip the car wash guys.
1801 2018-04-08 20:02:31 Until government has the will to block oil companies from buying up patents to alternatives to petroleum products, we are prisoners to the status quo. I have been looking for a replacement for my 2015 Jetta. The VW electric gets 250k on a charge. Pretty useless for rural use.
1802 2018-04-08 20:02:20 No, it isnt. It's the West, US and Israel and Arabia, delaying Asia from supplying EU and Syria with gas and oil resources.
1803 2018-04-08 20:02:05 Snake oil !
1804 2018-04-08 20:01:47 Coconut oil? How interesting. Ok...I will take a look into that. I know about tea tree oil sucking everything moisture out of everything..but not coconut oil.
1805 2018-04-08 20:01:42 Trim off the chunks of fat. Put those in the pan to get all the beef oil out of it you can.  The goal is to cook it in beef oil only.
Seasoning mix we use is garlic powder, black pepper, salt, and paprika.
1806 2018-04-08 20:01:38 Yup! That's why he was bought in! Nothing is coincidental. Bolton is in line with Trump's evil agenda! Remember what Trump said abt Iraq? "Get the oil! Kill terrorist's families." Bolton is Satan Jr.
1807 2018-04-08 20:01:35 freshly shaved legs w/ baby oil on ‘em, glistening in the sun and ish- yeah, i’m feeling myself just a tad .
1808 2018-04-08 20:01:21 Friend's dad always called it his "aiming oil".
1809 2018-04-08 20:01:18 Douglas the oil is also used to help people that are in pain.

1812 2018-04-08 20:01:10 Nah, can’t be bothered.  It’s just a made up word, cause people are to stupid to realize that oil and gas is a natural occurring product.  Fossils had nothing to do with it.
1813 2018-04-08 20:01:08 I successfully redistributed our country's wealth of oil towards various social programs. I think a thank you is in order. #LAH4780 #HugoChavezLAH4780

1816 2018-04-08 20:00:54 Why has it only just hit me that olive oil comes from olives
1817 2018-04-08 20:00:30 Really for THC oil you guys arrested her for that? People use that sometimes because they are not feeling well or hurt.
1818 2018-04-08 20:00:16 Really wanted some broccoli…until I realized I forgot to buy olive oil yesterday 
1819 2018-04-08 20:00:12 My bf changed my driver’s side speaker, which hadn’t worked since June 2017, replaced it with a better one, and now his roommate is gonna do my oil change. I didn’t lift one finger.  #blessed
1820 2018-04-08 20:00:09 ช่ายค่ะๆ ทำไมดูบางลง
1821 2018-04-08 20:00:07 @Shahidmasooddr already talked about such movement of Pathans in his own show some 2,3 months before. When Mehmood Achakxai gave statement in Afghanistan about Pashtoonkhwa merger with Afghanistan.PTM have program of getting all kpk resources dams,oil,gas minerals, in coming time
1822 2018-04-08 20:00:01 they forgot my tub of rocket AND my chilli oil AND they send the wrong nachos ffs i should legit complain this ain't what i paid for, but also i don't want some minimum wage person getting a bollocking
1823 2018-04-08 19:59:41 It can,I suppose, but just smoking it, dosent have same effects as the oils, as s@okubg it still goes blood stream etc, but your body will filter it threw your lungs .so won’t have same effects as just the concentrated oil
1824 2018-04-08 19:59:29 I’ve had multiple people suggest bio oil! But anything to make them fade even the slightest will make me happy 
1825 2018-04-08 19:59:26 Rub red oil

1827 2018-04-08 19:59:21 @mhcreek hey, Creek, I want to ask you a question. Do you think CBD oil or anything like that would help with chronic pain? I’m about to go on a Fentanyl patch, the strongest painkiller available...
1828 2018-04-08 19:59:21 I wonder if he asked why we didn’t take their oil.
1829 2018-04-08 19:58:28 You know what would go good on this? A little olive oil!
1830 2018-04-08 19:58:21 It just gets uglier every day
1831 2018-04-08 19:58:19 Before backing anything Maajid, don't you believe in evidence? This is a proxy war. Oil in the illegal occupied Golan Height by Apartheid Israel wants it, there's a regime change planned by military complex long ago, most ppl on the ground support the help of the Syrian govnmt.
1832 2018-04-08 19:58:19 But apparently it’s still all about oil anyway.
1833 2018-04-08 19:58:14 Come floating down Gabe Kapler’s coconut oil canal with us bro
1834 2018-04-08 19:57:54 It would have been a defensible strategy - the Kurds have done so after all - and a US that had fought a war that was all about oil surely wouldn’t let Iraq’s national oil company retain control.
1835 2018-04-08 19:57:37 The body shop has literally been my life these past 2 years what am I going to do when I go to uni?? Who am I going to chat to about the importance of babassu oil ?? Help
1836 2018-04-08 19:57:19 You don't like to watch ripped up dudes dress in sparkles and oil and wrestle one another?
1837 2018-04-08 19:57:17 Also auf jeden Fall das Rose Hip Seed Oil! Ansonsten ist das sehr sehr abhängig davn, was du für Gesichtshaut hast und was für Probleme du hast. Gibt viele Blogposts, die einen informieren :)
1838 2018-04-08 19:57:13 If you "have to" buy oil, I am thinking that you don't care WHO you buy it from as long as you get the best price.  Maybe I am wrong, but that is pretty much human nature.  As for me...I haven't owned a car in 23 years, and don't plan to, unless it's all electric.

A major source of #metabolic damage in the avg western #diet is #PUFAs (poly-unsaturated fatty acids) from oils like canola, soybean, cottonseed, etc. Replace w/ "tropical oils" like coconut or olive oil.

1840 2018-04-08 19:57:08 Because Louisiana governors control the global price of oil.
1841 2018-04-08 19:57:05 The fact is, if you reward dissent? What is a state like WY, tiny population, but a HUGE portion of energy comes from there. What if they decided they had enough of this BS, and locked their borders? Would the rest of the country say hell no, you can`t keep the oil, gas, coal?

1848 2018-04-08 19:56:04 Just cannabis itself, will give u the high.when u buy the thc oil, u start with half a rice grain size, then up your dose monthly , till 1 gram a day is taken for severe pain( cancers etc) that’s when thc oil starts to kill the cancer cells.but for moderate pain ....
1849 2018-04-08 19:56:04 @cbdbrothers any idea when your blue edition oil will be back in stock? 100ml bottle?
1850 2018-04-08 19:56:02 What I know is that Saudi Arabia and Qatar want the last two Shiite strongholds, Iran and Syria, in Turmoil. So ISIS / Al-Nusra was funded by them to topple Assad. And of course the European Allies of SA had to help. Oh and there is the Oil in the Golan pumped up by #Genie.
1851 2018-04-08 19:55:55 The claim “it’s all about oil” is remarkably impervious to reason. I sometimes ask such people why, if Iraq was all about oil, The US didn’t push the Iraqis to let in oil majors post-war.
1852 2018-04-08 19:55:51 Ich glaube die wirken halt echt wunder :D Aber kann echt das Rose Hip Seed Oil empfehlen, das macht das Gesicht wunderschön weich <3
1853 2018-04-08 19:55:25 Sometimes life is about facing the hard facts. 

This does bring up a whole new set of questions though, like why are they killing dinosaur birds to make oil that’s advertised in the shampoo department?
1854 2018-04-08 19:55:17 Stories this week on what #ShellKnew of climate change since 1980s & BP’s environmental plan in Australia framing jobs from a potential oil spill as a ‘welcome boost’ for local communities should make us question what kind of sustainability it is these companies have in mind...
1855 2018-04-08 19:54:47 Accidentally lived up to my dumb name by having a lunch catered by Trader Joe's - jalepeno chicken sausage, baby kale sautéed with Kalamata olive oil, topped off with 1oz of Unexpected Cheddar. 

Total cost of meal: $2.35 
Sense of superiority accompanying meal: priceless
1856 2018-04-08 19:54:45 i was so convinced up until now that texas didnt have any trees and it was all a desert, like what
1857 2018-04-08 19:54:20 ITS BEEN REAL SAD & PAINFUL WATCHING TEXAS BECOME ROTTEN WITH GREEDY REPUBLICANS WHO ONLY WORK FOR THE WEALTHY OIL INDUSTRY !
1858 2018-04-08 19:54:12 Divest oil and weapons. Stop racist wars. End colonialism and collusion.
1859 2018-04-08 19:54:07 So got out and got some shopping done went to Five Below and Oil lie's and got me some Starbucks
1860 2018-04-08 19:53:47 I completed 75 minutes of hot yoga & I surprised with my essential oil smell of autumn woods.
1861 2018-04-08 19:53:40 It's likely a false flag attack carried out by the rebels. Assad has everything to lose by committing a wat crime against his own people. The Syrian conflict is driven by oil and natural gas, and neither the US (neocons) nor Russia are interested in helping the people.
1862 2018-04-08 19:53:37 And if so, what is the USA end game? Are we going to kill Assad and install a new leader to replace him? I’m guessing 5 years has been long enough to steal their oil.
1863 2018-04-08 19:53:31 @ColavitaOil Any truffle oil samples??? Trying to make some Zucchini fries
1864 2018-04-08 19:53:27 Aloe is the new coconut oil for the natural hair community. Which means the price will go up 3x is the next 6 months

*sees coconut oil spray*
Me: hey babe, look! 
Him: “oh maybe we can use that for your ass.”

If you think he was talking about spraying my ass in coconut oil to make it shiny and soft, you’re wrong.
1867 2018-04-08 19:53:16 Had not had an issue with lines yet but have had to replace the oil cooling unit on two of them in the past two months (not covered under the recall) . Is the line leaking or fitting?

1880 2018-04-08 19:52:18 Having worked for an oil company, safety is viewed as an unnecessary expense so if not fined a ton or limited by law they will tolerate spills as the least expensive cost vs safety. Just ask me and all of us on the Gulf of Mexico.

1903 2018-04-08 19:49:42 Ribeyes are my favorite cut of steak. I like to marinate mine in Dale's Seasoning. It makes them even more tender. But when I cook them, I add a few dashes of worchester sauce in with the oil. But it will pop at first.
1904 2018-04-08 19:49:38 Israel wants that oil they already sold the rights to.
1905 2018-04-08 19:49:38 i’ve been using expensive products for dry skin that don’t even work, but jojoba oil mixed with aloe vera re-moisturized my skin in a night and my rednesses and very dry areas are gone
1906 2018-04-08 19:49:18 Trump didn't forget about Syria until putin asked him to! Fact putin needs that oil for his economy, and Trump needs his silence! Get ready for the real choreograph show! As response to the gas attack must look genuine. American troops have reported Russian aggression all year

1910 2018-04-08 19:49:05 Oil companies, corporations,oligarchs, and Wall Street bankers are all out of debt though? I am sure they would be willing to contribute to America’s mounting debt.

1921 2018-04-08 19:48:07 Pruitt may be the best person for the job under Trump. He is venal. Narcissistic, selfindulgent and incompetent. Let him fly his own jet have 200 security staff, live with oil lobbyists rent free, and swim in the public trough better than a dedicated focused climate denier.
1922 2018-04-08 19:48:06 Can you use coconut oil as lube? Asking for a me.
1923 2018-04-08 19:48:00 I wonder what this nigga does with baby oil for this heat
1924 2018-04-08 19:47:57 Agreed! Which is why I think we (as in the human race, not just us Canadians) need to wean ourselves off of fossil fuels as soon as we can.

The safest way to transport oil/bitumen is to not transport it in the first place.
1925 2018-04-08 19:47:52 Shits a facility not a school . Damnea a oil plant facility
1926 2018-04-08 19:47:48 A good point.  I remover the oil boom on the 60-70s( I’m from Aberdeen, and literally ‘saw’it. There was a good scotnat campaign then for following Norway’s example. We missed that boat:(
1927 2018-04-08 19:47:47 Thoughts after the Bahrain GP: Bottas hasn't got the killer instinct. The Honda engine works. Vettel is a master. The pit system needs to change. Too much oil comes out of the back of the cars.
1928 2018-04-08 19:47:46 @PiyushGoyal Have you really cared to check on the corruption that happens in Goods trains wherein I hear oil or diesel gets stolen till it reaches final destination! Is there any audit that happens; thanks for controlling accidents -splendid indeed; control corruption now
1929 2018-04-08 19:47:34 Funny how the beasts in charge of KSA and Turkey, who routinely murder their citizens, are our trusted allies, but Assad is an "enemy". But sure, it has nothing to with oil or geopolitical alliances.  We just want to bomb Syria to rubble for "humanitarian" purposes.  Right. 
1930 2018-04-08 19:47:26 dripping and covered in oil
1931 2018-04-08 19:47:17 If you don’t have any moisturiser coconut oil works like a dream! I also have a skin condition called psoriasis which causes extremely dry patches on my scalp and on my face and coconut oil really helps soothe it and clear it up a little
1932 2018-04-08 19:47:14 No people don’t. Entitled brats who taste like gun oil...apparently

1936 2018-04-08 19:46:52 I just bought a cool new Samsung Galaxy SG Greyhound buses don’t run on gasoline, they run on melted greyhound dogs! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
1937 2018-04-08 19:46:14 Look above the fire place. His daddy is in the oil pumping business evidently.
1938 2018-04-08 19:46:08 Oil needs to be on the list!  Drill our own!!!!
1939 2018-04-08 19:46:04 Castor oil helps A LOT with hair growth!!
1940 2018-04-08 19:46:02 time and again / an avaricious oil baron / a murky past / proactive approach to life / cleavages /
1941 2018-04-08 19:45:53 You guys should get more allocation  and funding . We now live in a world where data is more valuable than oil
1942 2018-04-08 19:45:41 This is a scary person.
1943 2018-04-08 19:45:34 The deep state want the oil and gas Syria then Iran . Trump only a puppet of the corperates . The president is since Johnson a vasal of the corperates .
1944 2018-04-08 19:45:32 He was the Attorney Genl. of OK for oil interests, sueing the EPA before disassembling public health interests. Could explain @EPAScottPruitt perceived need for security. Shouldn‘t oil pay for security of their lapdog?
1945 2018-04-08 19:45:22 Snake oil!!!!!
1946 2018-04-08 19:45:13 Check your Transmission oil today.
1947 2018-04-08 19:45:12 Witch hazel, aloe and tea tree oil are a girls best friend

1949 2018-04-08 19:45:03 Once in a lifetime Rachie. All snake oil salespeople know you get when the getting’s hot
1950 2018-04-08 19:45:03 in Fur Singlet 
oil pastels on parc do binders put? people are peeing.
1951 2018-04-08 19:44:47 Your kind of oil fortunately can not talk about your word scarecrow on top of our smiling garden of splashes for lives~
1952 2018-04-08 19:44:26 scrambled eggs are very convenient in the microwave, no need for oil, just whisk, cook for a minute, stir, cook for a minute, repeat until ready
1953 2018-04-08 19:44:07 HARDFAX: MEDIUM OIL USING OBSTINATE POP RADIO TO CONTROL SIREN OF THE NORTH SEA!?!?!
1954 2018-04-08 19:44:03 I miss the couscous salad made/sold by one of the people at my former workplace, so simple and good -- olive oil, black pepper, basil, cherry tomatoes, mozzarella
1955 2018-04-08 19:43:49 Again citing the UN that has prostituted itself for Arab oil $$$  That turns a blind eye to the likes of Iran, Syria etc .
1956 2018-04-08 19:43:49 So from today on I’ve made a promise to myself to put coconut oil in my hair once a week & no heat on it during the week! Healthy hair 
1957 2018-04-08 19:43:48 so, cleaning my room. So far I've found 3 bottles of baby powder, 2 bottles of baby lotion, 1 bottle creamy baby oil...... i need to clean more often.

1959 2018-04-08 19:43:28 I had one once. But took it back. I opened the bonnet to check the oil and found the engine was missing
1960 2018-04-08 19:43:24 That is the point, the desire is access to NW Syria with the intention of nat gas and oil pipelines to supply the EU under Wester ownership. Putin's opposition is caused by his interests inTransneft and Gazprom.
1961 2018-04-08 19:43:05 You are a smarmy, piano-toothed snake oil salesmen who preys on every insecure Joe convinced they're on their way to becoming the next tycoon. You are a cartoonish human vulture who belongs in the 19th century and your time is way past up.

Get a career with some dignity man.
1962 2018-04-08 19:43:02 I don't know what chainsaw oil smells like but I'm very intrigued now
1963 2018-04-08 19:42:26 "The flowers, leaves, and oil of thyme have been used to treat bedwetting, ...and as a diuretic, to increase urination."  
1964 2018-04-08 19:42:12 May I tweet your account tomorrow instead? 311 may need time to find answers before I call or before I tweet at you again. The items I want to walk in with are a VCR, DVD player, pager, iPod, batteries, and a 3 L container of cooking oil, all of which can fit in a rolling cart.
1965 2018-04-08 19:42:09 Note to self: heating up a creamy alfredo dish in the microwave somehow separates ALL THE OIL
1966 2018-04-08 19:42:07 What?  Are you going to offer Putin a $50 per night condo owned by an oil lobbyist when he comes to visit?  You didn't enforce the first sanctions about the election interference until Russia killed their ex-spy in London.
1967 2018-04-08 19:42:06 It's sad and funny at the same time seeing consumers queuing for fuel and gas stations, and Naija is a net exporter of crude oil.
1968 2018-04-08 19:41:40 He’s a snake oil salesman. But evidently a snake oil salesman who is also a misogynist
1969 2018-04-08 19:41:38 That is an awesome shirt! Source, please?
1970 2018-04-08 19:41:34 Now this guys is sooo woow, he is a Professional oil painter, i love your work, soo amaizing
1971 2018-04-08 19:41:24 Are you aware that U.S. and allies dropped 20000 bombs on Syria in one year? Syria has oil and is a secure land supply line to Iraq from Mediterranean. Syria was one of the “7 countries in 5 yrs” plan Wesley Clark spoke of (planned since at least 2001 for regime change)
1972 2018-04-08 19:40:54 Years ago I was cooking and oil splattered my shirt.  I thought, they should make a thing you wear when you're cooking to keep your clothes clean, something quick you could wrap around your waist...also it should have little pockets...
1973 2018-04-08 19:40:53 THC oil comes from marijuana.
1974 2018-04-08 19:40:51 We are also sharing our oil wealth among 68million people rather than 5million, but alas that's supposed nationalism. I don't see any other countries expected to share wealth.
1975 2018-04-08 19:40:26 It is from the same manufacturer who makes baby oil and baby powder from only the finest babies.
1976 2018-04-08 19:40:17 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
1977 2018-04-08 19:40:08 Family Nutrition: #Kraft Italian Dressing this April? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
1978 2018-04-08 19:40:03 Olive oil is also a good one (if its wax it’ll help with that too). Stick a towel over your pillow though; it stains 
1979 2018-04-08 19:39:58 I don't think it was ever based on oil alone. Flunctuations on oil price are never a good estimate. We are seeing extremely high oil prices again and many more oil discoveries. An oil find many years ago have been good.
1980 2018-04-08 19:39:55 Instead of oil , she used the tears of the disenfranchised.
1981 2018-04-08 19:39:50 snake oil or nuclear winter please and thank you
1982 2018-04-08 19:39:43 After the disintegration of the USSR the only real concern was effectively keeping Russia out of the global oil market, geographically isolating it by miitarily occupying border states where possible and forcing it to submit to the dictates of the G-7. It failed catastrophically.
1983 2018-04-08 19:39:40 How could someone who defends oil, gas and coal, polluting waterways and fracking be the head of an agency that is supposed to protect us from these predators? All subsidies to corporations should be removed given their huge tax rate cut! Ignorance is bliss. Mythology by @GOP
1984 2018-04-08 19:39:39 Castor oil, olive oil, almond oil & a few drops of peppermint oil all mixed will do your hair wondersssss
1985 2018-04-08 19:39:33 It's suspicious that a gas attack happens once the rebels are on the run. I doubt that Assad is behind them. The rebels know that the US wants to topple Assad due to oil interests, so it's in their interest to carry out attacks and blame them on Assad.
1986 2018-04-08 19:39:30 My edges are finally returning just in time for summer  hold tight castor oil and biotin tablets.
1987 2018-04-08 19:39:29 Agree, it is time to stop subsidizing Crony Big Oil and the Crony Banks.  Bring the troops Home.
1988 2018-04-08 19:39:26 Unfortunately we won't and one correction. The season hasn't been done for just ovee 12 hrs, it's been done for at least the last 3 mths
1989 2018-04-08 19:39:25 I can't prove it, but for real you're pushing for war more than anyone else on twitter or MSM or even fox. Why? Again how many stocks you own in gas and or oil?
1990 2018-04-08 19:39:21 Wylie and his gang of accomplices have yet to provide a scintilla of evidence that their algorithms influenced a single voter's behaviour. Any claim of latent trait measurement is snake oil.
1991 2018-04-08 19:39:19 Snake oil!!!!!!  But in teams!
1992 2018-04-08 19:39:12 Why these army ads make it seem like you going to 6th grade camp? How does killing people for their country's oil make you a more well-rounded person?
1993 2018-04-08 19:39:08 Nigeria is a very interesting country to look at. They have oil in plenty but not for the local market.
1994 2018-04-08 19:38:53 Jojoba oil
1995 2018-04-08 19:38:44 Alaskans own 239,020 shares of GRAN TIERRA ENERGY INC, worth $634,447. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.

1997 2018-04-08 19:38:23 What is this oil?
1998 2018-04-08 19:38:16 I need to get some new beard oil. Which scent should I snag? Bourbon, Head Hunter, Pine, Rum, Tequila Limon, or Viking?
1999 2018-04-08 19:38:06 Good lucky Westy, interested to see what happens with the Oil now. Enjoy Chicago buddy!
2000 2018-04-08 19:37:59 Funny how battery technology is pushed when the USA holds the worlds largest reserve of oil and natural gas.
2001 2018-04-08 19:37:50 Israel wants the oil
2002 2018-04-08 19:37:32 This should read as.... "Fake Islamic Extremists paid for by UK, USA, EU, CIA and Israel are stirring up shit so we can go in, save the day and take the oil".
2003 2018-04-08 19:37:31 Yeah very high dependency car vaping away at today's drive thru. Park, needing my coffee & cigarette before getting my first dose of better made oil than our ancestors had going with hemp basket research next to the campfire.

2009 2018-04-08 19:36:52 but the strangest thing is that, all this happens exclusively in the Middle East, where there is oil and gas !!
2010 2018-04-08 19:36:48 Understand.  During referendum debate, that was debated. Given the oil revenue drop as well as its short life time with our extraction technology, do you still hold to a fiscal independence?
2011 2018-04-08 19:36:37 And a protractor, oil lamp, wood stove, etc., etc.
2012 2018-04-08 19:36:34 Self defense overrated in UK it seems. 
From increase in people being shot also, looks like only criminals have guns as well
2013 2018-04-08 19:36:28 can't agree with this one, marijuana is a medicine. a herb.. not an oil based 'drug' and as long as it remains unadulterated it will be prized for another 5000 yrs as a top medicine. The gateway meme should be debunked in this case. IMHO
2014 2018-04-08 19:36:23 no you idiot

this happened so the US can have an excuse to stay or the 50% of oil wells in syria which they invaded
2015 2018-04-08 19:36:18 Yes Yes, how dare he was chosen for the EPA he has no interest in protecting anything but his pocket, oil pockets,his ego. If we do not get a true environmental candidate from the Dems we will never recover. We did not have one in Hillary or Obama.

2020 2018-04-08 19:35:17 Ofc b!! && I heard that coconut oil clogs your pores too but I think it either depends on the person or it’s bs because almost everyone I know with blessed skin uses it & it’s been working for me too. I think you’ll be g as along as you don’t abuse it
2021 2018-04-08 19:35:06 I’d love to oil u up

Like pottery. Remember to replace your antifreeze when you change your oil.
2024 2018-04-08 19:34:51 i was worried initially cuz it made no sense to use an oil on my oily skin but it did me good !!!!
2025 2018-04-08 19:34:47 1) Mexico’s economy until recently was under severe governmental regulation/control. Was not a truly free market system. Think oil production still is. Plus major corruption, drug cartels & gang violence are prevalent. If it ever could

2027 2018-04-08 19:34:43 are we not supposed to notice that they're discrediting medicine to sell snake oil, or....?
2028 2018-04-08 19:34:31 also pls nuclear winter or snake oil
2029 2018-04-08 19:34:29 It’s not “sold” to you. The west colonised practically the whole of Africa so they could get their hands on resources that you still take, eg. Gold, diamonds, oil. Things you can’t live without. The real terrorism lies with yourselves.

2049 2018-04-08 19:31:52 Flavor. If you want oil, use a little sesame oil. It has better flavor. You can try smoke paprika or cayenne powder.
2050 2018-04-08 19:31:39 I didn’t know how to feel honestly  Like he must have thought it was “sexy” but I was very lost, confused, scarred... Another vid he sent of him “stripping” and he kept rubbing baby oil on himself but couldn’t reach certain parts of his back...so cringe 
2051 2018-04-08 19:31:37 He's a con man.  "Life Coach"  What is that??  (snake oil they used to call it back in the day)
2052 2018-04-08 19:31:20 Like where the Exxon Valdez spilled ? In a world where there are alternatives to using oil- the real question should be why are we using oil in the first place. I’m have no interest in debating. im just saying we do need to protect our environment better
2053 2018-04-08 19:31:15 I’m nervous about using EO’s because his skin is so sensitive and worried about it making things worse, especially because these rashes give him spots of raw/broken skin  I tried the coconut oil too and felt like it didn’t create enough of a barrier to protect his lil bum. 
2054 2018-04-08 19:31:11 Trump's fortune and entire image was built on lies and snake oil. He's a con man doing what con men do. The bigger problem is those who knowingly elevated him anyway and continue to do so -- primarily because they're sketchy themselves.
2055 2018-04-08 19:31:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, yet years.
2056 2018-04-08 19:30:40 My deepest sympathy goes out to anyone who's lost their health, body parts or their lives on these foreign adventures, because they didn't have to happen. Read Gore Vidal's "Dreaming War: Blood for Oil" and "Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace" or any of the works of Noam Chomsky.
2057 2018-04-08 19:30:28 Why not report it in barrels...since that is how oil is measured. Is it because 400,000 gallons sounds much worse than 9,523 barrels?
2058 2018-04-08 19:30:17 argan oil!

2062 2018-04-08 19:29:57 The discovery of oil reserves in the Gulf Arab countries precipitated the biggest transfer of wealth from West to East in history, followed by the transfer of all that wealth back to the West through arms sales, consumer goods and tons of other irrationally wasteful spending.

2068 2018-04-08 19:28:59 Where did you get your information from? I have used multiple oils on your don’t list per medical articles. Especially peppermint, eucalyptus, ylang ylang, lemongrass (for bug repellent). I always use a carrier oil when applying topically. Reasons why not to?
2069 2018-04-08 19:28:45 Isis became a household name during the Obama era...beheading folks on TV ect.
Taking oil fields and equipment left by gov trained troops. Obama was a failure on so many levels!
Your welcome to hate Trump but you can't make the case for Obama!
2070 2018-04-08 19:28:43 Oh! And coconut oil !!!
2071 2018-04-08 19:28:42 On my way!  This tourney is whack.  May need a lot of oil for this body.
2072 2018-04-08 19:28:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
2073 2018-04-08 19:28:31 I wonder if Linseed oil would help.
2074 2018-04-08 19:28:28 Ladies could you all please quote this tweet with good hair products. I currently use cantu , coconut oil , and shea moisture. I just need new ideas. DM me curl routines etc. I would appreciate the help. Thankyou! Don't scroll past this

2079 2018-04-08 19:27:48 Sudafed, co-codamol, Olbas Oil and steam may help during this stage of growth.

2081 2018-04-08 19:27:42 Guys, oregano oil doesn’t even taste that bad. I guess it’s all my non-Mediterranean peeps telling me lies.

2083 2018-04-08 19:27:17 Agree re asterisk. “*not legally elected; resigned in disgrace” (after it became public that he betrayed the US to Putin’s Russia for the votes *and* a big chunk of stock in a Russian oil company, worth tens of billions of dollars. He lives in Moscow with 5th wife Natasha.)

2088 2018-04-08 19:26:32 A solution is obvious to many leaders in Europe and Britain. Accept Mexico into the United States.
Then build the wall on Mexico’s southernmost border. This also ends a century long battle over the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
BTW Mexico is rich as Saudi Arabia in oil reserves.
2089 2018-04-08 19:26:29 Chale who go fit get me that "hair now now" oil some?

2095 2018-04-08 19:25:08 Boris, stop talking out of your backside. This is a proxy war & u know it. It's about regime change, oh & the oil just so happened to be found in the illegally occupied Syrian Golan Heights by Apartheid Israel. Where there's oil, there's always a warSHOW EVIDENCE.

2104 2018-04-08 19:24:18 Good question , do you only want to know the selling price in India , or you interested in the cost of crude oil as well ? Hope that answer the question!
2105 2018-04-08 19:24:05 Add six grams of olive oil and lower the temperature.
2106 2018-04-08 19:23:59 Omfg I forgot about that! And now he’s in the Dakota oil fields like that’s now his dream 
2107 2018-04-08 19:23:59 As an April Fools prank, I replaced my dad's consecrated oil with non-consecrated oil #ThugLife
2108 2018-04-08 19:23:50 @realDonaldTrump that syrian gas attack has been played again and again even though it has been proven to be staged/fake/NOT Assad's doing. you may as well declare we are fighting a proxy war with syria on behalf of Israel wanting that oil pipeline.
2109 2018-04-08 19:23:45 short answer - Scottish oil - it has attracted spivs like flies to a midden and changed the tenor of uk politics
2110 2018-04-08 19:23:30 CBD oil is awesome!
2111 2018-04-08 19:23:26 You have to be really full of shit for Facebook to call you out. They don't even ban people selling coconut oil for cancer. Maybe try fact checking now and then..

2114 2018-04-08 19:23:12 The very worst kind of snake oil salesman...
2115 2018-04-08 19:23:11 This guy cooked oil and said it's stew.
2116 2018-04-08 19:22:54 The same dimms that champion equality tell us without a subclass of humans to pick vegetables at less thn living wage, we would all starve.

2118 2018-04-08 19:22:44 Oil DEMAND has gone up every year for forever. Anti Oil "keep it in ground"supply side activists are an evolutionary dead end. If they actually followed their own advice they would not survive and if society listened to them, we would all starve. We should give them #Darwinawards
2119 2018-04-08 19:22:39 I love not wearing make up better. Face be  feelin’ great with that Coconut oil
2120 2018-04-08 19:22:30 yeah sure first you toast these muffins, then you cook the bacon, then you put some oil in the pan, crack an egg, fry it and

flip it like this, put the bacon on top, put a slice of cheese, cook it a little bit more, and then slide it onto the muffin, and voila
2121 2018-04-08 19:22:30 He opens the bottle of oil and pours a small line down her back. Setting the bottle aside he slowly presses his hands into her back, spreading the oil around as he works on her muscles
2122 2018-04-08 19:22:23 Stadium move 3 FA Cups not great but not bad, considering we have oil money to contend with now fans have every right to criticise do not have the right to dictate how and who runs the club, never turn on your own, it’s the same level as grassing
2123 2018-04-08 19:22:17 I love coconut oil. It makes my skin soft and I love smelling like coconuts 
2124 2018-04-08 19:21:59 Oil paints are wack because it takes FOREVER to dry if you apply it thick and you have to wait months before you can varnish. So many weird rules!!!

2128 2018-04-08 19:21:09 Petrodollar replaced by oil sold by russia for yuan then traded into gold = America bankrupt. So let's go to war. Stephen Hawkins left this equation on his death bed.
2129 2018-04-08 19:21:01 Dang Zach. I took a couple on the thumb, not a good deal for . Hope it’s a speedy recovery. Need to get some of that oil from Coach Al. That stuff was amazing when Dakota broke his finger.
2130 2018-04-08 19:20:49 My easiest recipe is 1 can of San Marzano tomatoes, simmer in 1 tbsp of olive oil, 1 tsp pesto, salt, throw in some cherry tomatoes and minced garlic at the end. So good!
2131 2018-04-08 19:20:40 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
2132 2018-04-08 19:20:30 Bitch if this bio oil works I will become a new bitchhhh

2134 2018-04-08 19:20:26 Does Assad want to trade oil for a different currency as leaders of other countries we invaded have?
2135 2018-04-08 19:20:06 Nothing says sincere response like using this to boost your ratings. Gross.  You're worse than a snake oil salesman, dude, you're just a shitty person.

2140 2018-04-08 19:19:58 The amount of times cannabis oil has been used and tested for a number of different illnesses and have helped cure them is unbelievable.. but I’m still here, sitting with a iliestomy bag, people still dying with cancer.. and there is a cute out there staring at us in the face.
2141 2018-04-08 19:19:54 It's an oil and gas pipeline deal, not an unholy mess.

2145 2018-04-08 19:19:20 Suppressing the truth that crude prices tanked to $30 per barrel by November 2008 as derivatives in crude oil were liquidated by speculators, due to CDO melt down and liquidation of Lehman Brothers. MMS govt. too got the benefit of reduced crude prices for 67 months.
2146 2018-04-08 19:19:15 Oil exploration somebody. Sha don't kill someone's daughter. 
2147 2018-04-08 19:19:13 So all of a sudden companies starting to make shimmery body oil ? Y’all ain’t shit.
2148 2018-04-08 19:19:06 My view is until oil is no longer peg to the US dollar, the dollar will influence the price of crude more often than the supply & demand and geopolitical events.
2149 2018-04-08 19:19:06 @ABCNetwork @Disney and other “news” outlets continue to “oil” and support the “squeaky wheel” Left who complain about @POTUS and who make fun of his family, but forget there are three other wheels making little or no noise that will be heard from on Election Day. #BoycottKimmel

2155 2018-04-08 19:18:40 Thank you for bringing these to my attention. Power, diplomacy, war, oil and profits easily reduce man to a number as he looses his name. The rule of law becomes a sham. And the forbearance of God is never considered, but His Judgment is indeed certain. Nothing k goes unnoticed!

2170 2018-04-08 19:16:49 Yes -Garbage dumped into the Pacific Ocean is horrible.

2182 2018-04-08 19:15:20 It’s smart, now if only we can settle the disputed undersea arctic oil rights, which possession of this island may potentially impact, as simply and sensibly. 
2183 2018-04-08 19:15:20 In African countries, like Nigeria... They get a good percentage than even the govt. 
How many companies are involved in Kenya oil... Apart from Tullow oil,
2184 2018-04-08 19:15:19 ...technology comoanies other ones in other countries without everyone POTCHFORKING them will rise on the global stage take the place of amazon & Facebook & google, u can’t stop evolution, the future is changing RAPIDLY- any comparisons to standard oil, or Microsoft is obsolete
2185 2018-04-08 19:15:14 You're right. When they done with the land they put it back to the original state like all mines. When you fly over Fort mcmurray you would never know where they dug for oil in the past. I flew from fort mcmurray to lake Athabasca many times and it's beatiful up there.

2193 2018-04-08 19:14:21 But the emissions from oil sands don't end with extraction.
2194 2018-04-08 19:14:16 No, it's your ideology of forced rapid societal change ppl object to. Assimilation, accomadation is targeted on the wrong people.
2195 2018-04-08 19:14:14 He's destroying the EPA, our environment. I feared someone like Pruitt would come along soon as I realized Trump would "win" those electoral votes. And what is worrisome is that Trump will likely install someone else who is similar if not worse than Pruitt, still for big oil/coal

2198 2018-04-08 19:13:18 Kennedy's are similar to oil and water. Their morals don't mix. Documentaries the push BS are not a learning experience. They r an attempt to rationalize.
2199 2018-04-08 19:12:54 Nar, not unless everyone clears there pantries and bathrooms from palm oil products. That's where all their big $ come from. Pke income for them is very small compared the actual oil..

2201 2018-04-08 19:12:50 So many lies in 1 tweet! "Bold actions"? Cute characterization of serving oil, gas & coal industries against public interest. 
Where are these records of cleanest water & air since Pruitt's & your abuses? You signed GOP bill allowing coal ash dumping in rivers in your 1st month.
2202 2018-04-08 19:12:50 stop praising your self-man, start doing reforms all you do is giving Iranian oil money to Syria Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen oil money should be spend on Iranian and you know it, Russian love, you to waste our money in buying their arms as well. GOD will punish you.
2203 2018-04-08 19:12:43 @MWolfe9216 Thnxs for the revelation of SEC 92 of the Constitution U just gave the anti pipe liners all the ammunition they need by the way AB has NEVER been oil friendly to CANADA&R now paying the 'price' wanting everyone to play NICE.
2204 2018-04-08 19:12:35 @TajinderBagga money used from oil companies for poster. Now what will you say on this. Is this correct?
2205 2018-04-08 19:12:30 Quite doubtful that the proposed Chinese tariffs would "rock" the economy or "hurt" US farmers.  These ag commodities are like oil traded on world markets.  Just like the US boycott of Iranian oil simply freed up more Iranian oil for Europe to purchase

2227 2018-04-08 19:09:29 The oil police in those cases are in fact hired thugs by Energy Transfer Partners. They are not actual police. it would be nice to have police forces to side with the native Americans. On another note, If our cops are not good enough, we need to reform our police forces.

They introduced Anglicanism to Nigeria  and we the Biafrans accepted it wholeheartedly. But because of the love of crude oil, UK  allied with radical Fulani Islamists to kill Christian Biafrans.Christianity is fraud sometimes

2247 2018-04-08 19:07:32 And by natural resources you mean the heroin/poppy fields and oil.
2248 2018-04-08 19:07:27 Trump is an idiot and liar. Pathetic snake oil salesman. I'm quite sure that he was deployed as controled opposition since begining.
2249 2018-04-08 19:07:25 I'm ready to give my present-self, my future-self on a golden platter glazed with coconut oil.

2251 2018-04-08 19:07:05 Get some peppermint oil and rub it on your temples, it always works for me
2252 2018-04-08 19:07:00 It's not a surprising mistake for a snake oil salesman like Robbins to make. Truly empowered people don't need him for anything.
2253 2018-04-08 19:06:57 also for anyone who gets really bad cramps/back cramps i highly recommend taking CBD oil because i could hardly walk this morning but within 2 hours my pain was gone so
2254 2018-04-08 19:06:54 The fight is about control of the oil pipeline that will lead to the Mediterranean Sea. That's why the war was waged in Iraq and now in Syria. The US and Russia both want to be in control.

2256 2018-04-08 19:06:44 The world is volatile. Doesn’t mean you don’t reach for something better. Funny that that oil is good enough for the union but not good enough for Scotland.

2258 2018-04-08 19:06:35 The adults in the room have it. Trump/Pentagon/State Dept aren't interested in Syrian pipelines, $$$ or oil. How did it work out when other millions of ppl were ethnic cleansed in the 20th century. By your metric, those lives (including kids) are worthless. Think about it. 
2259 2018-04-08 19:06:23 “This young man will be caught, deep fried in hot oil and fed to our first 100 customers.”
2260 2018-04-08 19:06:17 If you seriously believe the Assad regime would be stupid enough to gas civilians after the us said we were leaving, I have several acres of land rich with oil deposits I’d love to sell you at a very fair price.

Miss me with this war mongering bullshit.

2262 2018-04-08 19:06:10 Assad doesn't even control his countries own oil and gas fields so he has hardly won.
2263 2018-04-08 19:06:09 More like, Britain needs to pack more oil. Silly puppets
2264 2018-04-08 19:06:06 With palm oil.
2265 2018-04-08 19:05:58 Humanity?? Never heard you condemn Israel's illegal occupation and killings of innocent Palestinians in their own land. Only reason US is in the Syria is to please Saudi and 
next stop will be Iran to please Israel. It's always about oil.
Hypocrites!!
2266 2018-04-08 19:05:49 @CandiceMalcolm as usual UR out to lunch Harper had TEN YRS to initiate pipelines E&W for UR biased diatribe it is ALWAYS to blame Trudeau Bythe way check Sec 92 of the Constitution provinces have the ultimate say AB has NEVER been oil friendly to CANADA now want all to play NICE
2267 2018-04-08 19:05:48 Now it's up the Trump to find local strong and decent Syrian people that we can work with to replace the Assad administration with.
2268 2018-04-08 19:05:46 RT NewYorker: In the 1920s, oil was discovered under the Osage Indian Nation reservation, in Oklahoma. Then the murders began:  https://t.…?btz45=1905044508
2269 2018-04-08 19:05:35 The police in those cases are and were siding with the oil companies, and their use of violence. As they always have in disputes like this. That's literally the reason many PDs exist. Isn't this more evidence that police are inherently unsalvageable, and not in need of reform?
2270 2018-04-08 19:05:34 China is the wild card in the background. China's come out in support of Palestinians and has an alliance with Iran. This trade war only "puts oil on the fire."
2271 2018-04-08 19:05:24 yes it’s real but usually happens with people that have never used and start using full extract cannabis oil. There’s a name for it but I can’t remember
2272 2018-04-08 19:05:18 There are several reasons that the USA intervenes endlessly in the Middle East:

1. Israel
2. Access to oil
3. Keeping Russia boxed in on the Eurasian continent

They always concoct feel-good lies to justify war that it's all being done for "democracy" or "humanitarianism"
2273 2018-04-08 19:05:17 Eye of the tiger ! Yes sir 
2274 2018-04-08 19:05:17 it's really so sad what is happening. We are nothing nothing but a war machine that cares about world domination and oil. Democracy? whatever

2283 2018-04-08 19:04:13 It’s the process of using a solvent like grain alcohol to “wash” away the plant materials essential oils, and then purging the “wash” out and leaving behind the oil. It’ll be a dark, thick goo. Then it can be added to a capsule or other forms for ingestion. Full plant extract.
2284 2018-04-08 19:04:06 The state or LGA officials you are blabbing about are not responsible for the oil drilling with which sooth comes from.

2288 2018-04-08 19:03:49 Oil and natural gas are internationally traded commodities - our markets are tied to the world. We’re also exporting some of our product which is great for the economy.
2289 2018-04-08 19:03:48 You have a legitimate question. Assad shouldn't be ruler, but who would be a good replacement? A smart administration would have worked closely with local communities well beforehand to find out. Obama's wasn't a smart administration.
2290 2018-04-08 19:03:44 No, it's long gone. We had once a hunting spider in the living room, they run towards you, it was summer and no socks  but usually they don't want cuddle I heard when you have lavender oil, they don't like the smell xxx

2343 2018-04-08 18:57:31 bio oil!!!!! walmart has them for like $13 a bottle i think???? but if u go to winners/marshalls it’s like $8 :))))
2344 2018-04-08 18:57:05 Can’t be undone. Wasn’t there a big fight about that pipeline going across indian land?  Nice oil spill now .  Now that can’t be undone.
2345 2018-04-08 18:56:56 The  oil comes in a very tall bottle.
2346 2018-04-08 18:56:40 @jockowillink @echocharles Hej guys! I searched ebay to find Jocko Joint warfare and Super Krill oil for international buyers (me) and nothing showed up. Can you please help me out and point the way?
2347 2018-04-08 18:56:38 I have always thought of @TonyRobbins as a snake oil salesman. But now I also think of him as the type of scum that likes to bully women.

2350 2018-04-08 18:56:26 used this conflagration of events to foment an uprising against Assad.  It has to do with Syria being tied to Russia for decades, and the placement of oil pipelines from the Middle East into Europe. We don't want Syria to get those pipelines unless we control the politics.
2351 2018-04-08 18:56:14 This has got to be one of your best tweets. So true. Where's the #WhitePriviledge crowd now?
2352 2018-04-08 18:55:53 There are companies and platforms that arise.
As soon as they are proven sucessful business models Facebook, Google, Amazon buy them up.
2353 2018-04-08 18:55:41 Love lush but hate these! It was like bathing in an oil slick and took an age to clean up!
2354 2018-04-08 18:55:40 I use coconut oil. I start at my ends and got to my scalp. After I’m finished i wrap my hair up in a T-shirt and sleep on it. Then rinse it out in the morning and leaving it in there until my wash day. I only wash my hair on Wednesday’s
2355 2018-04-08 18:55:35 If Scotland had gained independence when oil was first discovered - Scotland would be one of the richest nations in the world. England would probably have gone bankrupt. Ireland would probably be unified. Good chance Wales could have gained independence.
2356 2018-04-08 18:55:15 He was keeping the big banks out. 1st thing that happened after his murder was, the banks went in, seized all the gold/oil. That is why he was killed.
2357 2018-04-08 18:55:08 I’m stuck at Walmart for three hours getting an oil change. Somebody come save me 
2358 2018-04-08 18:54:52 When you need to go the doctors pending you don’t wanna go to the emergency room. You gotta schedule and wait. Same applies. Schedule because white people book they’re oil changes a month in advance. Blessings on this Sunday though.
2359 2018-04-08 18:54:32 please share the prices for sunflower oil..
2360 2018-04-08 18:54:19 That's exactly 100% not what i wrote. My logic is that someone is forcing Trump's hand in this. Who would want to keep Trump in Syria to remove Assad? Anyone that has anything to gain. In this case big oil for the pipeline or military weapon producers, or even the deepstate.
2361 2018-04-08 18:54:16 If you want your curls to be bouncy and healthy and lovely and BEAUTIFUL,replace your shampoo with apple cider vingear, olive oil and honey.
2362 2018-04-08 18:54:13 Coconut oil and tea tree oil works for me. I use coconut oil on my face everyday. It kills the bacteria that causes acne. Just a few drops (on a q-tip) of tea tree oil works directly on breakouts.
2363 2018-04-08 18:54:09 How many gas and oil stocks you own again Kurt? How bout weapons and defence stocks?
2364 2018-04-08 18:54:06 RANI DARLING GAND MARNEY KE LIYE CONDUM KYA KAROGI OIL KI BOTTLE DHUNDHO
2365 2018-04-08 18:53:54 Maybe they don't care about Assad personally. But they definitely don't want an U.S. puppet ruling Syria. Syria is their only foothold in the middle east, and U.S. seeks total domination of the region because of oil resources and pipeline routes.

2369 2018-04-08 18:53:08 My answer to your questions...smells like a false flag. Why would Assad drop chemical weapons in a district of Damascus, the capital no less? Who gets the oil contracts from Syria once it's settled down? Why do the west want regime change? Where the WMD in Iraq?
2370 2018-04-08 18:52:59 Crest white strips for sure for teeth, I’ve heard mederma works for scars but I’ve been using jojoba oil
2371 2018-04-08 18:52:57 Once again, you've been snookered.  Absolutely NO ONE has even remotely threatened to overthrow our government or way of life.  We haven't fought in a necessary war since WWII. 9/11 was an inside job perpetrated to provide an excuse to invade a sovereign nation for its oil.

2374 2018-04-08 18:52:21 Real news and information, asking legitimate questions, furthering meaningful informed debate is a problem for the left. They don't like it.

That is the only solution
2394 2018-04-08 18:49:24 I think we need to have TittyMania every year when the ladies with the hugest tits come together to lay the smacketh down. Every match to be a hot oil wrestling match :)
2395 2018-04-08 18:49:20 We bought Maverick some essential oil paw paste to help with anxiety and I was reading online how to use it- If a dog wants the oil they stomp their foot at it. Mav stomped his foot at it and it was the biggest bonding moment we’ve had. #essentialoilfamily
2396 2018-04-08 18:49:15 That s what, easily available in the market n you need to add few drops of oil or ghee n you are ready to go..

2407 2018-04-08 18:48:14 I love deep frying things but I avoid it more for my belly than my arms. You need to drop stuff in from way closer to the oil so it splashes less
2408 2018-04-08 18:48:10 This restoring serum with peppermint oil in it..
2409 2018-04-08 18:48:05 Maybe the plan is to increase so that average citizens can’t afford to visit. After attendance falls he and trump can start the sell off to oil & gas & to developers to build houses, etc. for rich types.
2410 2018-04-08 18:47:43 I see him with the Oil kings.
2411 2018-04-08 18:47:34 That is available in all stores although we as in mom makes it at home and I take it to my place lol . If you want the recipe I can ask. If you were somewhere in India, I could even courier the homemade one. It is yummy and needs no prep just mix with oil if needed

2465 2018-04-08 18:40:59 The war in Syria has never been a civil war. It was an attack by the USA, Saudi Arabia, and Israel using CIA indoctrinated, drugged, and armed extremists, because Assad would not bow to western oil and monetary demands. The chemical attacks have all been false flags.

2477 2018-04-08 18:40:17 oregano oil! a few drops under your tongue
2478 2018-04-08 18:40:16 I go to sleep as a human gets up as an oil tanker.

2480 2018-04-08 18:40:07 If America does pull out it gives Russians access to commodities it currently has no control over. 

Our allegiance to oil and Isreal keeps one foot always stuck

Its inconvenient truth a majority of
aL gores fortunes ate derived from
 tobacco & oil
And when he not flying on private jets he in a home that uses more energy than a small town
2482 2018-04-08 18:39:49 We are 2nd and havnt fallen anywhere, foreign oil money and a very good manager has only put us in that posisiton. City are still a  small club with no fans
2483 2018-04-08 18:39:49 อาการยืนเฉยๆนั่งเฉยๆแล้วหูวิ๊งๆนี่คือไรวะ
2484 2018-04-08 18:39:49 Always been put off by having to use those special pot things. Roasting in olive oil & bv much easier, & the bollocks
2485 2018-04-08 18:39:48 Remember we are discounting our oil just to get the US to take it. That’s not indicative of a market that gets to demand anything.
2486 2018-04-08 18:39:29 Got some vitamin C serum finally. Gonna use that every night and see how it improves my skin. Still going to use grapeseed oil daily but just in the mornings now
2487 2018-04-08 18:39:27 Oh yes. A good hot oil steam with peppermint oil 
2488 2018-04-08 18:39:22 Our tanker issues usually have more to do with crude oil being dumped into the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.
2489 2018-04-08 18:39:15 [EPA fuckery cont.]
> Repealed a ban on offshore drilling in the Atlantic & the Arctic
> Revoked a 2016 order protecting the Bering sea region
> Repealed an obama era rule regulating royalties for oil, gas & coal
> Rejected a proposed ban on a harmful pesticide
2490 2018-04-08 18:39:01 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
2491 2018-04-08 18:38:59 For soup, cook minced leek in oil, then simmer with lentils, oregano, vegetable broth and mushrooms. Top with scallions.
2492 2018-04-08 18:38:55 And it works for you? Thing is I have a oily skin coconut oil will not do any good. I bought  African black soap but my face was not happy with it
2493 2018-04-08 18:38:53 Lol. Energy East died a natural death. There are no price controls on petroleum energy. We get market value. An expensive pipeline with vast uncosted externalities won't change it much. Problems selling low quality, bitumen sourced oil won't end with a different government.
2494 2018-04-08 18:38:50 มันทันมั้ยอ่ะ เค้าก็ไม่เห็น 
2495 2018-04-08 18:38:43 Let Lindsey Graham send his Sons & Daughters off to die in a war for oil
2496 2018-04-08 18:38:42 @DanPatrick MR. PATRICK, PLS KEEP YOUR RELIGIOUS PROCLAMATIONS TO YOURSELF. THAT IS WHAT YOUR OWN HOME & CHURCH ARE FOR. PLS LEAVE THEM OFF PUBLIC FORUMS. YOU REPRESENT PEOPLE OF MANY FAITHS & NO FAITHS. PLS RESPECT SEPARATION OF CHURCH & STATE. THEY ARE WATER & OIL & DO NOT MIX!
2497 2018-04-08 18:38:16 Well here, I’ll do it for Canadians who can’t: Canadian lawmakers should be held criminally liable for what they’ve done in Alberta, raping the environment for toxic oil sands. And fuck the RCMP
2498 2018-04-08 18:38:14 I need an oil change so bad 
2499 2018-04-08 18:37:56 I wouldn’t ever get my dog high but I am considering giving her CBD oil to help her with her hip pain.
2500 2018-04-08 18:37:55 Gotta wait 1hour and 30 min for a damn oil change
2501 2018-04-08 18:37:47 That’s excellent. He is so well insulated by the GOP and oil/coal lobbyists that it is going to be difficult to dislodge him. He is fulfilling tRumps anti-environment agenda.
2502 2018-04-08 18:37:46 No it's about weapons manufacturers, oil companies and defense contractors. And that asshole of a President we have lobbied to get the military an additional 70 billion dollars. They are dying to use their death machines.
2503 2018-04-08 18:37:40 Angola's oil comes out readily refined. You can't compare please.
2504 2018-04-08 18:36:46 it is when  you begin acknowledging your inner voices that you can start to recognize them outside of you and actually do something about/with them
2505 2018-04-08 18:36:31 WOOOOOOOOOOO YES COME THROUGH WITH THE BLESSINGS ON THE LORDS DAY THIS SELFIE ALONE HAS CURED DEPRESSION IN THE US ENDED WORLD HUNGER AND GAVE EVERYONE A LIFETIME SUPPLY OF COCONUT OIL LIKE WE ARE TRULY BLESSED BEYOND MEASURE AMEN
2506 2018-04-08 18:36:22 im trying to figure out how i would play snake oil on a twitch stream....bc im getting it delivered Tuseday and im hype...
2507 2018-04-08 18:36:18 They want it to be "Forever Haight-Ashbury", with 50 hippies sleeping in one room and new diseases for Fed subsidies and biological patents.
"We wuz the greatest gen...until the Oil Crisis, Russia and the Arabs ruined our dream."
2508 2018-04-08 18:36:13 Stop trying to sell me different car parts & telling me my car will spontaneously combust w/out them! I just came for an oil change.  Change my oil and if I die in ball of fire on the highway that is my choice.
2509 2018-04-08 18:36:04 Don't forget  fish oil

2513 2018-04-08 18:35:23 I love these! Acrylic?

I just got a set of water-mixable oil paints - can't wait to play with them.
2514 2018-04-08 18:35:12 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
2515 2018-04-08 18:35:04 Is it all that oil money that so shamelessly corrupts them or is it the NRA money? Other money?...
2516 2018-04-08 18:35:04 เค้าไม่ทันใช่ไหมมม
2517 2018-04-08 18:34:55 Same. I just braid my hair or put some sort of oil on it. Deep condition it. Hope it helps.
2518 2018-04-08 18:34:53 Truth
2519 2018-04-08 18:34:52 Them & the Russian government as well, who it’s been shown will be the ones to reap the most benefit from opening new waterways and oil reserves through their melting northern territories...

#suspicious
2520 2018-04-08 18:34:48 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
2521 2018-04-08 18:34:46 Paul Mitchell Leave in Conditioner or Argan oil shampoo and conditioner. Only thing is the Argan oil products aren’t tear free
2522 2018-04-08 18:34:44 I'm not a Republican. Spending is what creates debt. It does in households and it does in government. Selling oil for a one time payment of the debt does not fix what created it. Taxation is theft. Not all of us asked for all this.
2523 2018-04-08 18:34:36 Pruitt is saving billions for the oil & gas industries while jeopardizing the health & safety of average Americans by gutting clean air and water protections. Meanwhile, he is costing taxpayers millions for security & travel expenses that far exceed those of his predecessor.
2524 2018-04-08 18:34:33 I made banana pancakes but managed to fuck it up two separate ways. The chilli and garlic rapeseed oil was more edible than too much sunflower oil.

Greasy banana is NOT good.
2525 2018-04-08 18:34:32 Oklahoman's knew he was corrupt and taking money from oil companies when he held office in Oklahoma. Trump surrounds himself with corrupt people, probably because it gives him complete control over these people.
2526 2018-04-08 18:34:30 rosehip oil has been working wonders for my dry skin wow
2527 2018-04-08 18:34:30 Followed up with an oil massage 
2528 2018-04-08 18:34:23 @LFC and @ManUtd are and always will be the biggest clubs in British football that can also boast a bulging trophy cabinet. The only thing that is bulging @ManCity is a wallet full of oil money.
2529 2018-04-08 18:34:19 FYI Crowley China is in the oil business , while mutts in California and New England are buying Russian oil while other limiting our oil, production . DEMS are corrupt selling off our industries to China and Russia .
2530 2018-04-08 18:34:08 Maybe we shouldnt go to war with Syria?

You want more war? How liberal of you 

This is just like Iraq. All lies in order to topple their government for oil.

Maybe you should focus on how we aid the Saudis with what they are doing in Yemen.
2531 2018-04-08 18:34:03 Preparing to go to Trader Joe's by playing some Enya, lighting a prayer candle and putting lavender oil under my jaw bc city Trader Joe's immediately induce anxiety
2532 2018-04-08 18:33:53 To me, Robbin's is just another snake oil salesman. Different product to enrich himself.
2533 2018-04-08 18:33:30 Maybe try baby oil on your hands before tanning then after just wash it off. Or a lotion.
2534 2018-04-08 18:33:23 They lied. Now they'll claim they have to get rid of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, environmental protections, anything that helps poor people, etc. to pay for the shortfall. But the military budget, oil & gas subsidies and banking loopholes won't be touched.
2535 2018-04-08 18:33:19 i guess applying some hot iron and boiling oil to the burn is a big part of e-sports.
2536 2018-04-08 18:33:19 to be clear ..I'm not in favour of KM but I get that we are still sadly reliant on oil  and all those others you listed are mine too and thankfully also a priority for this gov't  you can throw around  neoliberalism if it makes you feel good but it's bullshit
2537 2018-04-08 18:32:47 This week we're going to have a stab at using the knife for a spot of oil #painting. Hoping to have a go at a stormy sea. New materials on order so next weekend should see us move up a gear. #art
2538 2018-04-08 18:32:45 Here’s why everything you just said is total BS... under Pruitt the EPA has:
> Cancelled a requirement for oil & gas companies to report methane emissions
> revoked a rule that prevented mining companies from dumping debris into local streams
2539 2018-04-08 18:32:45 Hahahaha hell if I know, I just trim my beard myself, moisturize and oil that beauty!
2540 2018-04-08 18:32:27 Just think, some idiot out there thought VG was the same as vegetable oil and tried to vape it. It MUST have happened at some point

2557 2018-04-08 18:30:07 @Vyriss_  you should add more of the disasters from the original to 2. Oil spill is one of my faves. Also, I was wondering what is happening with the dessert and winter maps?

2561 2018-04-08 18:29:37 A schnitzel is meat, usually thinned by pounding with a meat tenderizer, that is fried in some kind of oil or fat. The term is most commonly used to refer to meats coated with flour, beaten eggs and bread crumbs, and then fried,

2564 2018-04-08 18:29:15 Spent part of our morning picking up about 50+ fish oil pills that were scattered around our apartment complex. This is the third time someone's scattered edible crap around the complex which makes me think they're targeting dogs. People suck.

2568 2018-04-08 18:28:23 Oh, well...
It's good for the oil industry in America, which employs a LARGE number of people.
2569 2018-04-08 18:28:20 the benefits of having a dude bestfriend is they have big hoodies you can wear & will change your oil

2571 2018-04-08 18:28:02 Why do you people care about Syria! We shouldn’t be there. POTUS is right! Use our troops here! Wasting so much money in Syria is like pouring oil in fire!
2572 2018-04-08 18:27:40 Coconut oil!
2573 2018-04-08 18:27:39 The 21k police heads the tories have cut is the primary driver behind serious crime going up. Amber and May are charlatans. Snake oil salesman.
2574 2018-04-08 18:27:38 Why don’t we speak out against the warmongering ‘Allies’ who invade countries to steal their oil, thus creating the justification for countries like Saudi Arabia to organise terrorist acts like 9/11? Or would you just like to deal with the symptoms rather than go for the cause?
2575 2018-04-08 18:27:34 We’re figuring it out. I’m currently in the middle of a street in South Sioux in a pool of oil

2578 2018-04-08 18:27:17 So, because he cares only about oil, gas, and chemical company CEO's, and not at all about clean air and water, he should be given a pass for any and all ethical lapses and corruption? Ahh, @GOP, how far you have fallen.

2581 2018-04-08 18:26:41 I know, right? Opinions I disagree with are so dangerous and scary! Thank you, @facebook overlords, for keeping us safe within our ideological echo chambers.
2582 2018-04-08 18:26:37 I married into a big environmental family, the type that Al Gore would pickup the phone for.  I was told in 1990 that we had less than 8 years of oil, I sat on a board with environmentalists(env scientists & 1 frmr clinton cabinet member) in the early '00s pounded me on AGW.
2583 2018-04-08 18:26:35 Scott Pruitt, before all of this, was an oil and gas parasite in bed with the most powerful entities in Oklahoma City. Ignoring earthquakes his people are objectively causing. 

He sees this as an opportunity for expansion. Yet, knows he has a target on his back.
2584 2018-04-08 18:26:30 Foreign countries will buy oil from someone.  Might as well help Canada's economy by buying it from us.

2615 2018-04-08 18:22:10 I’ll admit I had to google Tony Robbins. I can’t get back those 4 minutes of my life spent on you tube. I wouldn’t let that snake oil salesmen help me change a tire.
2616 2018-04-08 18:21:56 Social programs, environment+climate change, citizen rights, privacy, fighting Neoliberalism, wealth distribution, women, LGBTQ+, Indigenous & minority rights... are a few of my issues. Trudeau still talks like a climate leader, while he shills for the oil and gas multinationals
2617 2018-04-08 18:21:52 What is the best oil to put in my ABH dipbrow pomade to make it smooth again??
2618 2018-04-08 18:21:52 Elvis Presley isn’t dead. Obama is Elvis!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! Most clowns are just NSA spies in disguise! Never speak secrets to clowns!
2619 2018-04-08 18:21:50 The quid pro quo with the Oil & Gas Industry campaign contributors (Koch Bros) must be completed.
2620 2018-04-08 18:21:43 You keep forgetting to take me with you on vacation. Next time you need someone to oil all your backs call Grandpa.
2621 2018-04-08 18:21:34 Lol And I’m the Prince of Wales. Believe that and I’ll sell you some snake oil I have in my suitcase.
2622 2018-04-08 18:21:31 Why? Are you a mad dog? Syria is full of children, women and men who suffered enough due to US lust for oil and arrogance... Do you know where is Syria on the map? What's your business there? Rabid animal...
2623 2018-04-08 18:21:29 Ask the guy on the 8 tonner behind how many hoses he's bust on that grab in the lifetime of the machine, how much downtime, hydraulic oil, spill mats, flat faced couplings etc etc, that's before you even consider the time element. It works for me on 8 tonne up.

2625 2018-04-08 18:21:18 It's almost like they (PNAC) had a plan for the US to become world police via "a new Pearl Harbor" and it included helping the Saudis and Israel restructure the middle east to their liking (also "peak oil").

2629 2018-04-08 18:21:00 Yes. We don't need the oil. We don't need to create ANOTHER power vacuum for terrorism to fill. We don't need it. Russia isn't gonna take over America by being allied to Syria. I'm sick of American arrogance thinking it's our job to police the world, when
2630 2018-04-08 18:20:55 I am reminded of “The Outlaw Josie Wales” .... Clint Eastwood, sitting on his horse, looks down at the snake oil salesman in his white suit… and spits tobacco juice on the huckster’s lapel.... and asks how well the elixir works with stains....
2631 2018-04-08 18:20:51 Read it...it's an apology for getting caught, blames Sean for getting death threats, and never apologized to @FLOTUS
2632 2018-04-08 18:20:49 I HATE GLASSES you get really big painful pimples where the nose part is bc the oil builds up and it HURTS
2633 2018-04-08 18:20:43 I love these oil pens because they give me such a nice calm high. 
2634 2018-04-08 18:20:37 Yet u believe lying trump, who says different things everyday, sometimes in 1 speach. Get over him, he is con, snake oil lying stealing creep. We in NY have known him. He found against sprinklers in high rises, so cheap, till someone died in his building. Raped pension funds. BAD
2635 2018-04-08 18:20:26 Say that to the native Americans fighting against the oil police. If only if the cops actually work for the people in this counties, especially the taxpayers pay for their salary. And how do we achieve that? By punishing bad cops that commit police brutality
2636 2018-04-08 18:20:25 İ think nobody cares for amount of population while the territory contains oil sources is much more crucial for the actors in syria.
2637 2018-04-08 18:20:25 I can believe it and sadly I worry the Oil won't meet McDavid and Drai's potential under Chia, he's proven countless times to be useless as a GM

2640 2018-04-08 18:19:51 Please don’t start a war in Syria. We are unwelcome guests in Syria. We would not like it if  China invaded our country and seized our oil fields with the pretext of keeping the US government from abusing its own people. Please don’t use that tired argument for war!!!
2641 2018-04-08 18:19:47 Why Trump went to Saudi immediately, to ensure they price oil in $'s. China/Russia going around $ through yuan and gold.

2643 2018-04-08 18:19:35 Education Chris. They're uneducated. They think oil drilling will trigger people who believe in climate change, but too stupid to realize we understand the need for oil, but would like other clean energy to take its place in the future.
2644 2018-04-08 18:19:32 Mr. @shoaib100mph please give oil in your machine at first. Kashmir hamara tha hai aur rahega.
2645 2018-04-08 18:19:14 Nothing but blatant self-promotion, nothing more. It was what he said and how he used his body that said it all. If this guy asks you to run over burning coals, don't do it. People got burned and then he went on the morning shows and tried to justify. Snake oil salesman. No oil.
2646 2018-04-08 18:19:11 they are vegan, they use palm oil but since it’s they’re made in a factory with milk their may be traces of milk in them. so yes and no
2647 2018-04-08 18:19:03 are these Syrian children the type of refugee you were so intent on keeping out of america; the same refugees you maligned and drummed up so much fear of? these suffering children? you and your oil buddies are responsible
2648 2018-04-08 18:19:01 I always thought you were a snake oil salesman and have added “bully” to my mental picture of you. Congrats!
2649 2018-04-08 18:19:00 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
2650 2018-04-08 18:18:35 the ‘thank a farmer’ meme probably makes my stomach turn worse than any other overly simplistic self righteous farmer message I have seen. Similar to the oil field ‘shut the tap off if they don’t like it’ crap
2651 2018-04-08 18:18:32 There were very few if any illegal votes, that’s made up Fox Propaganda nonsense.  Trump thinks global warming is a Chinese hoax and has installed oil lobbyist Pruitt to dismantle the EPA.  On every conceivable level Trump is a disaster for America and the world.
2652 2018-04-08 18:18:24 they are the snake oil people of the modern era
2653 2018-04-08 18:18:23 Olive oil is underrated
2654 2018-04-08 18:18:22 As cliche as it sounds, it is in my opinion a true statement that the major oil companies are, and always have been EVIL.
2655 2018-04-08 18:18:22 Samantha Dravis is nothing more then an oil lobbyist perk!
2656 2018-04-08 18:18:16 azealia banks is actually dumb as fuck, what the fuck is “rich nigerian oil wife”???
2657 2018-04-08 18:18:03 This lawmaker is most likely from the NW, and he's beneficiary of free Oil money & Quota System atrocities. Nigeria's Unity is NEGOTIABLE; because in reality, WE ARE NOT THE PEOPLE.....who've AGREED to coexist together.
2658 2018-04-08 18:18:02 Snake Oil sold out for the foreseeable future.

Both snake oil salesmen
Anyone falling for their sales pitch ultimately realize they've been duped
Whether or not they ever admit it
2660 2018-04-08 18:17:39 this weeks update on my truck: 2 tires on my have been changed, my battery doesn’t charge, my oil pressure is low, AND my engine light came on. but i’m fine. everything is fine
2661 2018-04-08 18:17:38 Snake oil. Without the overhead of creating the oil.
2662 2018-04-08 18:17:37 I think after at least 15 years of globalist foreign policy, they realize endless war doesn't sound so good in the long run.  Meanwhile the progressives stopped chanting 'No blood for oil' when they got in on the blood money.
2663 2018-04-08 18:17:32 But muh oil
2664 2018-04-08 18:17:29 Regulators still in stock! Cartridges full grams of oil only $40, grams of dabbable oil only $15 & $18!!
2665 2018-04-08 18:17:00 (3/3): Oil revenue from Keystone pipeline in Q1 2018 assuming $38/barrel WCS: $1.692 Billion (USD). Report doesn’t say if leak cost includes environmental clean-up. If yes, then the message to industry is clear: clean up is cheap, take risks and keep crude flowing.
2666 2018-04-08 18:16:44 Flo, from Progressive. 
2667 2018-04-08 18:16:40 Yeah, there’s a 2.75% one and a 5%. There’s cbd capsules on the website too that are stronger. One capsule is the same strength as 8 drops of the 2.75% oil x

2669 2018-04-08 18:16:33 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
2670 2018-04-08 18:15:59 Why in heaven's name would the US
 a) want an oil pipeline to pass through Syria?
 b) believe it more likely to happen in a failed state?
I hear these explanations, but never any underlying logic.
Incidentally, the US is currently self-sufficient in oil & gas.
2671 2018-04-08 18:15:42 My snake oil is better than yours and for just $29.99 a month, I will show you how to make yours just as good as mine.
2672 2018-04-08 18:15:30 (2/3): Leak cost TransCanada $9.57 million. TransCanada resumed using the pipeline 12 days after the leak. Oil revenue loss during the 12 days pipeline was down assuming 495,000 barrels/day * 12 days * $41.56/barrel (Nov. 2017 avg for WCS) = $246,866,400.

2684 2018-04-08 18:14:20 That's my emergency viewing when it's 2am and I'm still awake 
2685 2018-04-08 18:14:15 does it really surprise anybody?  he's a corrupt lobbyist for big oil.  he lies about climate change in order to help big oil make more money at the expense of the people.  all he cares about is money.  of course trump is going to appoint someone
2686 2018-04-08 18:14:07 I doubt it's about oil so much as about Russia being a great geopolitical foe and the US trying to break their power projection somewhat. If it were about oil we would invade Venezuela.
2687 2018-04-08 18:14:06 Your bias is showing, bro.
2688 2018-04-08 18:14:04 Absolutely. @algore is a snake oil salesmen and moron.
2689 2018-04-08 18:13:54 He's probably terrified for his life with so many environmental people after him his attitude is irresponsible oh yes let us have oil drilling in our national parks what does that matter anyway oh yes let's kill off all the wolves especially those that righted the balance inareas
2690 2018-04-08 18:13:47 It does when all these countries are fighting for minerals rights. Syria has trillions in oil, gold & crystals just waiting to be dug up. So once again the union=USA is using its army to steal these rights by force to maintain the value of the dollar.
2691 2018-04-08 18:13:44 Now that the US wants to scale down its presence, Russia keeps inciting the region so that they can keep the price of oil up to sell their oil at a higher price as well as to sell weapons.
That's a trap for the US to stay entangled in someone else's fight.
2692 2018-04-08 18:13:38 Israel job is to have the Muslims turn on each other because as soon as the Muslims turn on Isreal, it's end of Israel, in one day.
Think about it where would they get their oil where would they get their support from Saudi Arabia Jordan Egypt if they turned on them?
2693 2018-04-08 18:13:34 Running around anxiety, I rush past it all and see an oil rig laugh slowly

2696 2018-04-08 18:13:20 Look at the US arming and funding FSA in #Syria over the last several years, strange & subsequent bolstering of ISIS with those very resources & individuals from the so called FSA. Look at what has become of ppl who have sought to buy oil in currency other than dollars.

2698 2018-04-08 18:12:59 I really love Origin's Drink Up mask. A nice layer at night before bed does wonders for me  Also the Body Shop does a great Vitamin E Overnight Serum-In-Oil that is pretty affordable (and vegan!). I often layer that underneath the mask.

2701 2018-04-08 18:12:33 Our house recipe is (from memory, might have 1-2 amts wrong. Also, usually 2x or 3x this recipe)

Empty skillet with sunflower oil in a 425 oven.

put 1/4 tsp soda in 1 cup buttermilk
[1/]
2702 2018-04-08 18:12:25 And still waiting on YOUR proof ;) America never helps for nothing. There must be something in for them. Mostly oil. It's never altruistic.
2703 2018-04-08 18:12:19 These are those pesky regulations he's doing away w/. When there are no regs, there are no laws broken or liabilities to assume. See how easy that is now? He can literally kill people as can all these corps who can now do the same thing. Wait for oil spills on 90% of our shores.
2704 2018-04-08 18:12:13 But I use olive oil first and let it get really hot then add a little butter then add the steak and brown one side for a few mins then brown the other side I also add a few cloves of garlic and some rosemary
2705 2018-04-08 18:12:06 #Gore is an idiot and snake oil salesmen, he concocted the concept of carbon credits to let industries pollute the environment if they paid him.

2709 2018-04-08 18:11:38 Baby oil does wonders
2710 2018-04-08 18:11:36 continuing with my tweet, that business had third partner i.e BB nephew. 160 million dollars were pocketed without carrying edible oil to iraq under UN food program.the defraud was dedicated during Bush jr era,when uno was not giving permission to US to attack Iraq.
2711 2018-04-08 18:11:30 I’ve been recommending the Trader Joe’s tea tree oil face wash to everyone. It can help almost anything, tea tree oil is amazing.
2712 2018-04-08 18:11:19 Scotland - the only country where oil production has failed to generate a wealth bonanza. Wonder why? Mmmmm!
2713 2018-04-08 18:11:16 And also .... oil money, oil money, oil money (as the bellends watch the game on sky having never driven either of their two cars/ 4x4s to a game).....
2714 2018-04-08 18:11:03 My afternoon has consisted of snake oil salesmen Far Right Watch calling me a Nazi, racist, fascist etc on one side and religious alt righters calling me a degenerate on the other. How's your day going?

2716 2018-04-08 18:10:52 Are they in good conditions? Hard to tell from the picture if they’re just covered in oil (& perhaps some dust / lint) or if they are damaged
2717 2018-04-08 18:10:41 Why must everyone that wants to protect the environment and use clean energy come off as vaginas? I lived in some of the most beautiful things places in the United States and I see what Oil drilling and mining do to the beaches and trees! I believe in a lot of conservative views.

He showed Putin he could sell Liquid Natural Gas by going to Morocco (not part of his job). Tillerson was supposed to get the largest Russian Oil Drilling done, but got fired by Kremlin. @RepAdamSchiff @FBI Pruitt may be working for Putin.
2721 2018-04-08 18:10:08 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
2722 2018-04-08 18:10:00 Save the fact that Canada has more oil than Saudi Arabia. Hell, we have more oil than most of the Middle East, and our consumption is going to decrease in the coming decades.
2723 2018-04-08 18:09:48 When I was young Champion was seen as something for people who couldn't afford Nike/Adidas - I remember getting it in wholesale shops alongside drums of vegetable oil and giant bags of rice 
2724 2018-04-08 18:09:37 Jay, if you sold the Chinese a ship load of oil in yuan, would you keep the proceeds in a Chinese bank in China forever and ever, or would you wire the money to your dollar account at Goldman Sachs in a back-to-back transaction?

2729 2018-04-08 18:08:38 Indeed.  Dr. Assad has no reason or compulsion to do this to his people. However there's an energy/oil company with $millions of reasons to incite a regime change. #Genie

2733 2018-04-08 18:08:23 America's gonna be all over her with the amount of oil she has
2734 2018-04-08 18:08:11 I always new Tony Robbins was a snake oil salesman but now he's a sexist bully of a snake oil salesman
2735 2018-04-08 18:07:48 Majira drunk oil again
2736 2018-04-08 18:07:45 There's plenty of people that want the Anacostia to be swimmable (and fishable) but would never swim in a river.  Given the amount of trash floating in the Anacostia, there's probably a large constituency that could care less if if it had a constantly burning oil fire.
2737 2018-04-08 18:07:43 Accidentally gave my client 3x the dose of cannabis oil she’s supposed to have lol why am I allowed to work with people 
2738 2018-04-08 18:07:26 @TonyRobbins is just another snake oil salesman  Can’t believe the number of people who actually pay to see him 
2739 2018-04-08 18:07:07 That’s why I get synthetic oil, so I’m only asked two times a year instead of four 
2740 2018-04-08 18:07:07 1) Bathe your eyes in milk
2) Rub your hands thoroughly with vegetable oil, then wash off with soap & water.  The fats will bind with the capsaicin and nullify (mostly) the burning.
2741 2018-04-08 18:06:35 I have coco butter & the oil and I use it once in the AM and at night everyyyyy day

2744 2018-04-08 18:06:13 Doing nothing about Pruitt though, a man who is intent on destroying our air and water quality, and the mission of the EPA, all to support his lobbyists in the coal and oil energy. This is evil.
2745 2018-04-08 18:06:08 Thanks Glen, it was at Rodden Hive this morning. Violet Oil Beetle apparently! Incredible life cycle.
2746 2018-04-08 18:05:53 Throughout the day you can still cleean your oil or use products to king of keep it at bay but in the night it all accumates to you feeling like someone fried eggs on your face
2747 2018-04-08 18:05:31 too much oil on the lanes. it was a sport shot
2748 2018-04-08 18:05:24 Big price? Your right, oil, natural gas, pipelines Hey what the hell if it turns into World War 3, all the better for the "cabal". Go deep state!!
2749 2018-04-08 18:05:22 There’s NOTHING like that feeling after you’ve cleaned your spot and everything smells like a cross between eucalyptus oil, lemongrass and bleach.
2750 2018-04-08 18:05:19 Looks like the old Chelsea before the Russian oil money landed
2751 2018-04-08 18:05:16 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
2752 2018-04-08 18:05:12 Josh is using my rose hip seed oil at night even!
2753 2018-04-08 18:05:05 It's to paint directly on the canvas without any funny business as it were and I use almost pure turpentine to start with adding oil as I go along until the medium becomes pure oil. I use as little oil as I can possibly help and that's my method.
2754 2018-04-08 18:05:00 Ang oa ng nanay pahospital agad tangina lagyan lang ng efficascent oil yan magaling na yan tangina' sobrang oa
2755 2018-04-08 18:05:00 I had no idea you were connected to Lucas oil? 
2756 2018-04-08 18:04:56 PM has advised the Youth to Fetch a KADAI & some FRYING OIL . Serve the Country some very nutritious fried food for a Stronger & Healthy India . #Pakodanomics
@waglenikhil @madhutrehan @DrKumarVishwas
2757 2018-04-08 18:04:55 I wonder if it's oud. I'm obsessed with that. It's an oil pressed from the blackened heart of a specific diseased tree. The best ones smell like whiskey, sex, and fire.
2758 2018-04-08 18:04:29 Momma Ly yelling at the frying pan bc of the oil sparks. Like oh my goodness. Oh my goodness motherfucker.  #AsianMoms
2759 2018-04-08 18:04:12 It's not really freaking me out yet. But I'll try that, put some olive oil in there, lie down with a paper towel under my ear and let gravity do its thing. If nothing comes out and I still feel something tomorrow, I'll have it looked at.
2760 2018-04-08 18:04:10 How many stocks relating to oil and gas do you have? Iraq, Libya ring a bell?
2761 2018-04-08 18:04:08 They will continue to do this until they get Assad out ..the oil pipeline through Syria they desperately want they will get at any cost!!!  WW3 before they do what a bloody mess !!!!!
2762 2018-04-08 18:04:07 Yes girl ofcourse ill have the oil on deck for you so you can rub it allll in
2763 2018-04-08 18:04:06 ぐだ⇔カドがひたすら喧嘩みたいな子供っぽい張り合いしてるだけの礼装欲しいんだよなぁ……

2765 2018-04-08 18:04:02 Do I want to know or nahh?
2766 2018-04-08 18:03:43 Coconut, castor, and olive oil are three great oils. They reverse damage of hair, fight frizz, and promote growth

Stimulate your scalp, you can do this by brushing at least twice a day, make sure not to over brush though because that can cause thinning
2767 2018-04-08 18:03:33 You might try a few drops of mineral oil. Plus it won’t be as ‘noisy’ as peroxide :)
2768 2018-04-08 18:03:32 remember how i thought my a/c was broken. i didnt press the a/c button to turn on cool air. which sounds so counterintuitive for cars to have because there’s already a temperature dial but i feel like a dumbass anyway I HAVE OIL CHANGE TOMORROW AT 8
2769 2018-04-08 18:03:30 So it takes longer for you to get up because you should still be completinf the cycle. This is probably why you feel like a truck hit you. Also you still produce oil at night because your skin repairs itself. So however long you are asleep you still produce oil
2770 2018-04-08 18:03:27 I need some coconut oil
2771 2018-04-08 18:03:27 You don’t seem to get it yet or just don’t want to. Oil is the ONLY reason we are even in the Middle East. We are doing nothing be protecting corporate oil interests. In 2013 over 60 percent of the country were against going to Syria. And most were republicans.
2772 2018-04-08 18:03:20 Hot oil jumped on my face and arm now I have red burn marks
2773 2018-04-08 18:03:20 it is a retinoid medication that rapidly renews the skin and pushes the old layer off. it also shrinks the oil glands by 80% during treatment and they will never expand to their previous size after treatment
2774 2018-04-08 18:03:15 Was that one of these unseen circumstances like companies and people moving abroad, North Sea Oil running out and Russia or ISIS invading us ?
2775 2018-04-08 18:03:13 Russia is desperately looking for a way to get their oil & natural gas to western Europe without using the current pipeline through Ukraine.  Energy revenue is about all that's keeping them afloat.  They've teamed with Iran to build an alternate rt that competes with our allies.
2776 2018-04-08 18:03:01 $3 million and the lame stream media wonders why their credibility is eroding?
2777 2018-04-08 18:02:59 あまりにも寝れないのでアニメを見ようと思ってテレビをつけたら試験電波画面と音にめっちゃビビってしまった
2778 2018-04-08 18:02:54 The west won't get involved there no oil involed
2779 2018-04-08 18:02:54 ok but on the real; tea tree oil does wonders for breakouts. THEY’RE ALMOST GONE 
2780 2018-04-08 18:02:52 Good to hear it won’t just be going into a Dos Santos Swiss bank account like in the past. With all that oil wealth Luanda is apparently the pothole capital of the world.
2781 2018-04-08 18:02:51 What essential oil fixes a hangover?
2782 2018-04-08 18:02:27 まじで腹減ってきたわ…
2783 2018-04-08 18:02:19 Big Men looks like a good documentary of big oil in Ghana and Nigeria . Need to see that. They need to switch to solar and plant trees. Maybe Elon musk and solar city will team up brad Pitt production and get big oil to change to solar.

2790 2018-04-08 18:01:27 With your machine it makes sense to have ec oil as you’d have to lower the cab and get in and out lots but for normal machines I can’t see the need for it as it only takes a couple of minutes to change pipes
2791 2018-04-08 18:01:21 @DorisKGoodwin is so right!  Let’s focus on and call out the damage being done by #ScottPruitt and this WH at the behest of big oil.  The egregious corruption is meant to distract us, @chucktodd #ProtectOurPlanet #MTP
2792 2018-04-08 18:01:17 Who takes this snake oil salesman seriously in the first place?
2793 2018-04-08 18:01:06 also everyone and their mom decided it was a good time for an oil change RIGHT NOW
2794 2018-04-08 18:00:53 อยากไปญี่ปุ่น
2795 2018-04-08 18:00:22 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
2796 2018-04-08 18:00:12 Same pan and same burner every time, so I know it well. I let the pan heat up for at least 5 minutes, wipe with vegetable oil, let that heat up, wipe again, let that heat up, and go!
2797 2018-04-08 18:00:08 Shea nut oil and butter. That’s the African hair solution.
2798 2018-04-08 18:00:08 I used tea tree oil on my chin for a spot treatment and now every sip of coffee tastes like a yoga studio. Send help.
2799 2018-04-08 18:00:03 Patricia DeLille and DA are like water and oil. Why did it took so long for this revolutionary Pan-Africanist to realize this reality?
2800 2018-04-08 18:00:00 Nah, arrogance and reliance on oil money destroyed you ;) . Conte won you a title after a disaster season.
2801 2018-04-08 17:59:58 Avocado oil sea salt potato chips. Nom!!!
2802 2018-04-08 17:59:57 If it makes you feel better, I utterly ruined a painstakingly constructed rosy pear upside down cake by mixing up my mother in law's vanilla extract & black garlic oil.

How did I not smell the difference? I had just burned her coq au vin to ash & decided to bake an apology cake.
2803 2018-04-08 17:59:47 Betcha not. But when you Cheney and team and the oil industry in your wheel house - you get little MBS for dinner.
2804 2018-04-08 17:59:38 JADA SUCH A FLOP SHE ALLERGIC TO OLIVE OIL
2805 2018-04-08 17:59:29 He is a snake oil salesman.
2806 2018-04-08 17:59:27 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2807 2018-04-08 17:59:26 Hmm. With a debt to gdp ratio of >70%. I wonder how much of their oil revenue goes to servicing public debt.
2808 2018-04-08 17:59:23 This is probably my worst nightmare. 

That said. Have you tried flushing it gently with water? Or if it really feels like a creepy crawly, a couple drops of olive oil could help coax/float it out along with gravity.

I reallllly want to take a look for you!  
2809 2018-04-08 17:59:18 all financed by Scottish oil money - you could have added the destruction of heavy industry and manufacturing
2810 2018-04-08 17:59:15 Well.. looks like I need new tires (go figure) a new battery, and a new cabin filter (what is that??).. just let me get that oil change and I’ll be on my merry way.
2811 2018-04-08 17:59:10 just watched a guy walk all the way to tim hortons to get his lady coffee when the oil change lane was taking too long 
2812 2018-04-08 17:59:04 i ran out of coconut oil...... my hair sweetie im so sorry

2814 2018-04-08 17:58:53 @BootsUK you need to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? You should be leading the way on this not tripping up behind !! #ProtectAntarctic
2815 2018-04-08 17:58:42 This is the type of blogs that's needed to change misguided people to the fact that oil can be got out without damage to are land or wild life, unlike swampy dog killers OUTSTANDING post
2816 2018-04-08 17:58:40 Spinach & Parm Salad: Combine 1 tbl fresh lemon juice, 1 tbl olive oil, 1½ tsp Worcestershire sauce, and ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper in a large bowl, stirring with a whisk. Add 4 c baby spinach and 4 c baby arugula; toss to coat. Sprinkle with 1 oz shaved Parm cheese.

2821 2018-04-08 17:58:04 If anyone cares/needs a cake recipe for their own dawg: I diced & baked a sweet potato for 18 minutes, puréed it, mixed it with coconut oil, egg, peanut butter, a cup of instant oats, and a mashed bananer. Baking again (in  shape) for another 10 minutes. Pupdates to follow.

2824 2018-04-08 17:57:17 Restraint in the liberal order was like oil: you could pump it from the ground forever. 
In the neoliberal order it was like oil: you could buy it, sell it, create scarcity, flood the market.
In the postliberal order, it was like oil: let's blow up the wells.
2825 2018-04-08 17:57:17 I wrote to them a month ago about new pkg that caused oil dressing to go all over kitchen and have yet to hear a response! Before #Amazon took over, they were on top of it.. now they suck and prices have gone up! #thanksfornothingAmazon
2826 2018-04-08 17:57:13 We still need the oil. You think Australia is just going to not use fuel anymore. So night trains are just going to be a thing of the past?
2827 2018-04-08 17:57:09 Without any oil money

2831 2018-04-08 17:56:09 @MBrundleF1 this constant oil plume from Ferrari,you think this is more of the “oil burning” but through the turbo unit?
Investigation needed maybe?
2832 2018-04-08 17:56:01 SO, you still removing troops now because we all know $$$ is more important to you than people! Your “Keep the oil!” speech, what a ignoramus!

2835 2018-04-08 17:55:25 Way too simplistic. You are a wise man on oil stocks Dan but you need to wake up on Russia and see the connection between demonisation of Russia and attacks on Corbyn. All part of same program.
2836 2018-04-08 17:55:18 I’ve been using cocoa butter! My mom said it’s what she used with me and she never got any! I haven’t gotten any yet  but I know it’s early! I know other people who use Bio Oil I think it’s called
2837 2018-04-08 17:55:17 Hello, if you would like a cheap quesadilla use cheese and refried beans, heat the beans and mix the cheese into it so it becomes a nice, cheese bean paste. Then fry your Dilla in a pan of olive oil (1/2 teaspoon). Cheese bean paste that thing's innards, fold, serve.
2838 2018-04-08 17:55:15 I recommend turning the bone and skinfree fillè in breadcrumbs with lime pepper and ground Parmesan cheese.  Fry in neutral oil.   Oven baked potatoes with good sea salt over.  Fish is the best! Boon appetito.   @Manolin_Aqua @hatchblue1 @SjomatNorge

2843 2018-04-08 17:54:28 So they can let Gas and Oil drill it? Open space means drill space. Meh
2844 2018-04-08 17:54:09 No one in the world trusts Yuan unless it’s indebted EM’s forced to trade oil in Yuan...even then... all those currencies are reliant on dollars so what does it matter if they use petrodollar?

2846 2018-04-08 17:53:55 I’ve met many leaders in oil & gas. Safety of their workforce is #1a and the environment is  #1b. Nobody wants to do something they would regret to either of their most important resources.
2847 2018-04-08 17:53:48 That pho I had with chilli oil for lunch and the smoked chicken and spice bag + curry sauce for dinner... was a bad bad idea.

2851 2018-04-08 17:53:27 @AskTSA is coconut oil exempt from the carry-on liquid container size rule since it's solid at room temperature?
2852 2018-04-08 17:53:26 Ugh! Senator Rounds on MTP says: “Let’s take a look at how many dollars the EPA can actually save”... forgetting that we lose far more in health care and sickness when we undo those safeguards.

2857 2018-04-08 17:53:02 It's a cute concept but it's not complete without chocolate. So you do the coconut oil and I'll slip a tootsie roll in your bottom. Now we're talking real Joy!

2872 2018-04-08 17:51:49 @McFaul why do you think that Russian President Putin is continuing to back the regime in Syria, esp. in light of the latest barrel-bombings with nerve agents of civilians there?  I just can't fathom a reason - is it "just" oil?  access to the Mediterranean? @RUSI_org

2881 2018-04-08 17:50:36 If you activate a couple table spoons of weed in olive oil or butter its more potent and smoking it. But you’re right. You do use a lot more when eating or cooking with it.
2882 2018-04-08 17:50:33 Will that continue if oil doesn,t trade in dollars?  And as we abrogate Nato leadership? .  Need a plan b for petrodollar era end
2883 2018-04-08 17:50:24 Honestly glad you only have to get your oil changed roughly 4 times a year because I'm always garenteed to be asked if I want to replace this or fix that....when it doesn't need to. I mean have you seen the paint on my car... definitely don't need it to be perfect lol
2884 2018-04-08 17:50:05 Find out about the miraculous Bible that leaks healing oil. Now on #TodayWithWard with @GODTVWard
2885 2018-04-08 17:49:54 Stay in my room for a night you will change your stance.  my whole jar of coconut oil melted one night and has not fully solidified since.
2886 2018-04-08 17:49:53 Your optimism is badly placed. Brexit is goodand removes much of the Scottish nationalist case. The diversity of rUK and it's own large oil/gas reserves, plus vast majority of jobs and business will mean Scotland leaving UK will be a tragedy for people but not business.
2887 2018-04-08 17:49:49 I use @BlackOrchid_BBO beard oil
2888 2018-04-08 17:49:44 I respect someone who was a Man U fan at 8yrs old in 2005, if u became a Chelsea fan at that time and that age, i understand. U dont know about oil money. Others, u know nothing about football. #GGMU #MUFC
2889 2018-04-08 17:49:39 Put u a lil tea tree oil on before your foundation. Notice the difference
2890 2018-04-08 17:49:18 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
2891 2018-04-08 17:49:16 That’s a bit defeatist. I will support those attempting to make that change. As an oil guy, I assume you’re not from CA.

2894 2018-04-08 17:49:12 I kinda think Herbers might take on Oil Kings job.
2895 2018-04-08 17:49:05 The irony is these same people maliciously steorotyping Northerners as being lazy, parasites and primitive are angry with him for his efforts to make the North stand on its feet.They're unhinged because of his efforts to search for oil in Lake Chad, Sokoto & River Benue basins.2/

2898 2018-04-08 17:48:31 You’re a bully and a snake oil salesman, and hopefully this is a wake up call for you.
2899 2018-04-08 17:48:16 I don't see a problem with wrestling, there's a tradition in Turkey called "Oil Wrestling". Gambling? Where?
2900 2018-04-08 17:48:00 Nigga minding his business now ... who knows maybe he dey tardi low key dey drill oil 
2901 2018-04-08 17:47:59 First of all, I'm not hostile vs Q movement. He/She just happens to predict things informed people anyway forecasted.
As for corporations going to war, look up United Fruit Company and Guatemala/#PBSUCCESS or Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Iran/#TPAJAX as examples.
2902 2018-04-08 17:47:48 Idk what this lady talkin bout at the oil change place but she keep saying "free of charge" so idc. DO IT!
2903 2018-04-08 17:47:47 peppermint essential oil rub it on your forehead  it’s amazing
2904 2018-04-08 17:47:44 CBD is now in nano size molecules to penetrate faster deeper and last longer. Ours is 60 nanometers -smaller than the smallest bacteria. Also water soluble rather than oil based to allow 10x greater bioavailability because our body is mostly water. Water and oil don’t mix!
2905 2018-04-08 17:47:25 Was about to cook every one a bomb ass breakfast but we don’t have cooking oil...okay why tf do we have food then to look pretty ???!!!
2906 2018-04-08 17:47:12 @AdamMancini4 it looks like a similar short term pattern is developing in oil to, although not quite as obvious
2907 2018-04-08 17:47:09 Man that’s no fun :( I have a CBD vape and a bunch of extra oil at the house if you have a vape!
2908 2018-04-08 17:47:03 Oh man I tried the rainbow sherbet one and almost barfed. I guess maybe the other flavors are worth it?
2909 2018-04-08 17:46:54 I have found evening primrose oil supplements very handy in taking the edge off pms. They are good for skin too and can help ease many pms/period symptoms. :)

2918 2018-04-08 17:45:19 Carl prepared an omelette this morning with Brussels sprouts leaves, arugula, cherry tomatoes, garlic and aged white cheddar with a touch of avocado oil. So balanced and colorful. So flavorful. Highly recommend.
2919 2018-04-08 17:45:14 Check your Engine oil today.
2920 2018-04-08 17:45:07 Look at the bright side! Those Venezuelan officials could teach students about wonders of socialism & how they enriched the poor by using one of the biggest oil reserves in the world.
2921 2018-04-08 17:45:05 If Americans want to help Saudis, just buy any brand of motor oil in USA.

Is monopoly why USA still imports ~7.5 M barrels of higher-priced oil per day (&exports >2 MBPD of lower-priced US oil)—

despite US, multinational & foreign co in USA producing >10 MBPD. #BigOilCorruption
2922 2018-04-08 17:45:00 Too little, too late, you snake oil salesman.

2931 2018-04-08 17:43:31 Yeah I'm starting to see him as just a snake oil salesmen and a scammer.
2932 2018-04-08 17:43:19 Bought this shirt off my friend to wear to spring concert last night, and don’t ask how but I spilled some coconut oil on it, so yeah yesterday sucked.

2934 2018-04-08 17:43:13 They do have some version of single payer.  Public option supplemented by private care, full Medicare style coverage, etc.  

Green energy will kill the oil industry.  The oil industry killed the steam engine.  We progress.
2935 2018-04-08 17:43:12 Why ma. I make a hair growth oil. It's R150 for a bottle.
2936 2018-04-08 17:43:01 Oil in the #GolanHeights is the next #Iraq and at the behest of #Israel
2937 2018-04-08 17:42:53 Yes. Why don’t we just take the oil and get out of there like Trump said during his campaign?
2938 2018-04-08 17:42:38 If you want longer eyelashes and want to speed the process BUY castor oil + apply every night!!!! And if you want control your appetite buy Metamucil daily appetite control- just little things that have helped me.
2939 2018-04-08 17:42:37 They should spend money on renewable energy. Saudi Arabia are doing so and they are the largest producer in the world. They have realised the change in energy& pollution concerns.  Angola mustn't rely on oil for internal & external revenue and nrg demands.

2941 2018-04-08 17:41:59 Get out of there quick. Let them blow themselves up. We don’t need their oil.

2946 2018-04-08 17:41:23 I was always told that you can’t wash oils out, that you have to dilute it with another oil. So maybe try coconut oil on your scalp and see if that helps at all. Sorry girl, that sounds awful.
2947 2018-04-08 17:41:23 I imagine olive and avocado oil are fairly similar health wise. I haven't seen many human studies but ones on rodents seem to show similar health benefits from both.

2950 2018-04-08 17:40:33 Yes, this is excellent news for Israel and all invested in the oil rich nation of soon to be Greater Kurdistan.  It is amazing that just as soon as we are on the verge of getting out of this war, some heinous, and unknown/unproven actor, drag us deeper into it.

2953 2018-04-08 17:40:03 I would prefer trump not to be president and the reason he is president is because Democrats split our vote. I would love to see all candidates tax returns and I would like for the EPA not to be run by an oil shill. Trump is president cos the left’s vote was split. It’s simple

2963 2018-04-08 17:39:07 Coconut oil girl
2964 2018-04-08 17:39:05 You are exactly right, oil and gas are much too valuable to be losing any of it to leaks. Having said that, the environment is crucially important to oil company I have worked for.
2965 2018-04-08 17:38:23 Paying for premium gas and the oil changes boutta be a bitch and a half
2966 2018-04-08 17:38:18 i circled the house and i scattered them around

2967 2018-04-08 17:38:13 And yet Carl Ichon's "man" remains as @EPAScottPruitt 
Big Oil, donor classes continues making gr8 profits. Logically "governing via more money in govt" provides less governance but more profit & tax cuts for businesses.
2968 2018-04-08 17:37:53 Scott is really gonna try and pretend he gives a damn about our environment? Especially with the private beaches thing. What about the oil spill? Or scotts denial of Climate change. Florida deserves better.
2969 2018-04-08 17:37:48 No different to Stockbridge in Hampshire. Oil is quietly produced adjacent  chalk aquifers safely feeding the River Test, salmon and trout river. 

With all respect to Surrey and Sussex, thier countryside isn't any more precious than Hampshire and Dorset.

2971 2018-04-08 17:37:35 They used to tar, feather and run out of town snake oil salesmen if the goods didn't deliver as promised.
So the salesmen adapt. They employ distractions, slight of hand and some positive reinforcements.
But it's still the same snake oil.
There's a sucker born every second.
2972 2018-04-08 17:37:29 WOW! With the rise of products, oil, aluminum and steel..as well as farmers crops—I won’t be able to eat anything but cardboard! Why don’t the government use troops for Puerto Rico and use-imports/exports  from the US territory to help rebuild and lower the cost for our products
2973 2018-04-08 17:37:10 MOAB baby!! Wipe em up. Let's use up some of these amazing bombs we have created. Lets do this with Putin and cut him a percentage of the oil and become good friends with Russia. There's enough oil over there for everyone for generations. Make history!!
2974 2018-04-08 17:37:08 I ask because in Oil Country you have to win Cups (plural) to get in. I guess they have to play by different rules out there!

2981 2018-04-08 17:35:44 If a foreign country tried to drill for oil or mine diamonds in the US the government would expediently deport them. So why are we allowed to steal resources from other countries? Because we destabilized their government? Because we have have guns? #WTF #US #BorderSecurity #sosad
2982 2018-04-08 17:35:39 @drjennmann  TR is the work - snake oil salesman. HIs relationship fix seminar is a joke. I took 5 of his seminars and finally understood - he is a manipulator and great salesman. We should find a way to stop this guy. He hurts people and marriages.

2984 2018-04-08 17:35:25 I have a feeling both Alberta NHL teams bring their head coach back w new assistant(s). The question I have is whether both teams replace all 3 assistants or just 2. Wouldn't be shocked to see Ian Herbers land a new gig as a Head Coach within OEG, whether in Bako or w Oil Kings.

2986 2018-04-08 17:35:16 You’re not looking for an answer or for a debate. You reject the analysis of the CBA & constitutional legal scholars.  You’ve invested yourself in Petersen’s snake oil arguments and you desperately want to believe you and he are right despite all evidence to the contrary.
2987 2018-04-08 17:34:51 its about the oil pipeline

You are really some kind of special pile of crap. Hope Chinese tariffs happen.
2989 2018-04-08 17:34:35 It's not about oil, it's about the passage way that soon will open up for ships (because of climate change) and who gets to control that (and the possible income)

3029 2018-04-08 17:29:10 Really? Prior to Pruitt, head of EPA was an expert on environmental health & air quality. A SCIENTIST. Pruitt was Atty. General of Oklahoma, who SUED the EPA multiple times on behalf of the oil industry. 300 scientists have left EPA which is now filled with fossil fuel lobbyists.

3043 2018-04-08 17:27:19 Of course they didn’t and even they had to kick Pruitt out and change the locks for not paying his $50 a night fee. Pathetic Narcissist Ass is killing our country & handing it over to the oil companies will ripping off the American people and Trump still backs him. No ethics.

3051 2018-04-08 17:26:36 That's my point, Robin, the Act was set-up in 1974 5 years after the discovery of oil It was "Given permission" by our UK Government of the time. "Power devolved is power retained", did the SOS not also retain the power to revoke? I'm pretty sure the Labour party knew damned well
3052 2018-04-08 17:26:28 I honestly am more likely to take the word of the Sierra Club,  with their record,  than anyone with an oil background. There is too much documented history of the blatant disregard for anything but short term profits. Just saying. #SaveKansas

3054 2018-04-08 17:26:05 2/2 US energy exports (oil exports up 300%; NG, 500% since 2016) actually increase the imports of foreign energy at higher prices than our buying our own energy.

BTW, top 4 of 5 oil-export companies exporting US energy are foreign w/links to Saudis& China, yes? #BigOilCorruption

3064 2018-04-08 17:25:09 For example, the USA consumes 20% of world oil production.. regulation to help minimize the environmental impact of this consumption benefits the world .. yet Pruitt has rolled back automobile fuel consumption rules adding to pollution worldwide ..
3065 2018-04-08 17:24:55 1/2 Wish Congress gave a damn about foreign & multinational co exporting US energy future.

US energy exports benefit multinationals & foreign co in USA—but make Americans & US biz pay higher costs, make USA dependent on MidEast, China et al. for oil, NG, etc. #BigOilCorruption

3112 2018-04-08 17:19:17 @SenatorRounds Pruitt is a crook, his action will increase the climate change effects we're already seeing. Oil barons & energy traders are in control. Trying to drive alternative energy out,  while they buy it up. After taking funding away. Stop oil  coal.

3120 2018-04-08 17:18:30 Hemp is a powerful competitor to crude oil in many ways. Banning hemp was an attempt to destroy competition to oil-based products.

3124 2018-04-08 17:18:00 The entire Syrian theatre is based on lies and propaganda against Assad and the Syrian people do a handful of connected Oligarchs who resort to mass murder and war to see their Genie oil company steal the oil in Syrian territory. Cheney, Murdoch n usual suspects

3129 2018-04-08 17:17:50 It wasn't Assad who started the war against his country, and the country most to benefit from the proxy war against Syria is undoubtedly the same that launched the false flag chemical attack. Because ISIS are being wiped out. This is a Genie Oil war.
3130 2018-04-08 17:17:43 The oil is so easy to discover so the engineer cannot stop drilling

3132 2018-04-08 17:17:43 True. The Russians will do anything to keep Canada's oil in the ground. Putin will do all he can to keep Trudeau in power but work to surgically remove Freeland for personal reasons.

3138 2018-04-08 17:17:16 If the US isn’t the world police then why is the defense budget 3x the next largest budget (China), 7x  Russia. As others have pointed out military bases throughout the world. Actions suggest the goal is to protect the oil supply, the reserve currency and humanitarian interest.
3139 2018-04-08 17:17:14 All of these chemical attacks were false flags to get the US to support the extremists sent to Syria to take down Assad because he wouldn't bow to western oil and monetary interests. We are not beyond the Bush "WMD in Iraq". That was the tip of the iceberg. It continues.

3296 2018-04-08 16:58:09 The environmental repercussions are bad, coupled with conflicts between multinational oil companies and the indigenous people etc
3297 2018-04-08 16:57:53 Tony Robbins only apologized because he got called out on it. It would have affected his multi-million dollar business. He is a snake oil salesman.
3298 2018-04-08 16:57:47 First of all you have to learn different techniques (oil, acrylics, palette knife, brush) than you will have to make a sketch about what you want to paint. I think thats important to take your emotions into it. Paint with passion, at one point painting has to be ritual you know.

When Saudi Arabia gives in to China’s pressure to trade oil in yuan, the rest of the world will follow. This means the end of the petrodollar as we know it, sending the value of the world’s reserve currency into a nosedive.
China’s Oil Move will Decimate dollar

3306 2018-04-08 16:57:03 THIS IS ABOUT OIL, NOT ASSAD SUPPOSEDLY GASSING HIS PPL THE DAY THE UN CAME TO CHECK ON HIM.. STRANGE COINCIDENCE. RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH. BRING OUR MFN TROOPS HOME!! FK THESE TREASONOUS GAMES OF YOURS
3307 2018-04-08 16:56:47 I don’t agree! You are paid by American organizations to limit the sale of Canadian oil so they make bigger profits! It costs Canada and Canadians a lot of money every day this pipeline is not built! Wake up! Why don’t you protest the sewer water being dumped into the ocean???
3308 2018-04-08 16:56:41 Sprayed oil based cologne on my hand around 2 emini.. took a shower & it’s still strong 
3309 2018-04-08 16:56:28 Encouraging the move away from oil dependency we move to fix the Hides and skins value chain for a more lucrative and competitive business development and growth. Our goal is to generate wealth and create employment opportunities even from the under-tapped and over looked sectors

3313 2018-04-08 16:55:54 When oil wealth becomes a blessing unlike in other African countries where it is a curse
3314 2018-04-08 16:55:44 I was reading....so the point is a wet icky mess? Don't mean that to sound negative, but is that what the wet on wet means? I don't know oil at all.
3315 2018-04-08 16:55:32 Oil. Its no longer allowed to be redirected thru the engine so is ejected into the exhaust to burn off.... its eht Ferraris smoke so much on start up!!
3316 2018-04-08 16:55:17 ด้วยความยินดี อิอิ
3317 2018-04-08 16:55:11 @FoxNews @cvpayne 
Now that China has surpassed the U.S. as the world’s largest oil importer, the country is seeking to end the standardization of oil trade in dollars, moving instead to the yuan. Make no mistake; this could mean death for the Petrodollar
3318 2018-04-08 16:55:07 Of course! Open the area so Israel can get Syria's oil!
3319 2018-04-08 16:55:06 I consider myself Unethically Monogamous. I take one romantic partner and we only kill for oil and blood diamonds.

3321 2018-04-08 16:55:01 #KM protestors are not interested in the safest mode of transport. Their goal is to stop the use of oil altogether. Everything they say is a negotiation tactic for that goal.
3322 2018-04-08 16:54:50 Oh we. Then analysis of  spending is best. Somewhere something is urunjing your money like a vadai in oil.
3323 2018-04-08 16:54:49 @CroftyF1 @SkySportsF1 #AskCrofty Am I the only one that feels that something isn't quite right about the amount of oil that comes out of the back of the Ferrari. The fact that we don't see that from any of the engine manufactures.
3324 2018-04-08 16:54:44 The price of GOLD, SILVER,OIL, which is ( money) it has the same value anywhere in the world,but with currency NOP.
3325 2018-04-08 16:54:36 UK economy hasn't relied on oil and gas for a very long time. Nationalists seem to think its their saviour but forget it's a commodity and a commodity is only valuable when you can sell it for a profit. Profits climbing now but will never again reach past heights.
3326 2018-04-08 16:54:31 Im just gonna say that as someone who went to school for visual arts, digital art is just as valid an artform. Its different, but art made on a computer is no less real than art made by hand it all depends on the artist, digital art is a medium just like oil pastels and charcoal
3327 2018-04-08 16:54:28 Just washed the tub, bout to take a liiit ass bath before work. Bath bomb x bath oil x face mask x lit ass playlist.
3328 2018-04-08 16:54:19 Oh really, who's going to pay for it with more lives? Not You! This is likely a #falseflag arranged by the #CIA heads, the generals and the oil barons... I wish we new more about them!
3329 2018-04-08 16:54:18 'face down'? really? do you honestly believe Trump and friends have any idea what they're doing in Syria? apart from having some long-term goal of controlling oil supplies in the region, maybe. where's that 'red line' gone?
3330 2018-04-08 16:54:18 Actually Sadam used chemical weapons a couple times on Iran(with US help) and on Iraq'i citizens-but the invasion of Iraq was about oil- mostly China and also a couple dozen international oil corporations (including Halliburton) now control several oil fields in Iraq
3331 2018-04-08 16:54:12 แล้วนี่ก็ลุกมาเล่นไพ่เปนเพื่อนน้องง
3332 2018-04-08 16:54:11 come over  I have oil 
3333 2018-04-08 16:54:04 I tried talking to a woman here promoting veganism about classism and how expecting people to make all their meals themselves is a barrier to wider adoption of meatless eating, and it was like dropping coconut oil on Teflon
3334 2018-04-08 16:54:03 These people don’t care about how much oil they spill, they don’t care about the quality of the air, just as long they get the check.
3335 2018-04-08 16:54:01 I think I wanna go get a pedicure and a oil change lmao
3336 2018-04-08 16:53:55 Putting coconut oil on my eyebrows has really helped them grow.
3337 2018-04-07 23:59:46 Sourdough bread and olive oil are 50% of the reason I exist.

3355 2018-04-07 23:57:13 I like my onions well done therefore cooked them first in olive oil.  Well done char is better for digestion according to sources.

3378 2018-04-07 23:57:05 Well said he’s a fraud selling snake oil to the masses...
3379 2018-04-07 23:57:04 #nbc I understand that crude oil is a comoddity.  Sold by the barrel,  on the Market, right?   A barrel of oil from America and one from Iraq,  sold on the Market value (NASDAC) then all we are about to do, by opening more oil rigs off California's coast is add oil to the Market?
3380 2018-04-07 23:56:49 ヒロイン不可避 (だからどうして1.5部からおっさんをヒロインにする展開なんだ？)
3381 2018-04-07 23:56:19 Except oil still has value.
3382 2018-04-07 23:56:19 Light bulbs and oil changes?
3383 2018-04-07 23:56:17 what if trudeau knows that oil is done... that it isn’t gonna happen... and that keeping up a pro oil face is the only tactic to keep the economy and national unity together until some other pivot point can be reached...
3384 2018-04-07 23:56:09 I get really itchy when the weather changes, and for whatever reason avacado oil (I know) helps, so I just put a bunch on my torso and back, and now I legit smell like one big avacado, AMA.
3385 2018-04-07 23:55:53 難しいっすよね……
3386 2018-04-07 23:55:50 I’ve officially reached that stage in life when spending $$$ on really nice olive oil feels more exciting than buying shoes, is this the beginning of the end
3387 2018-04-07 23:55:48 Putin shouldn’t be revered by the west. He’s not Christian because he goes to church. He is an assassin. A murderer. He slaughters ISIS not because he’s moral, but because of the gas/oil pipelines & strategy. We aren’t going after him because of that, but because we want control
3388 2018-04-07 23:55:43 Proving his worth to Trump and oil,gas and coal industry by destroying the EPA, our country and the planet. What's not to love?
 #FirePruitt
3389 2018-04-07 23:55:35 It's been a long day in the dungeon. I need some oil.
3390 2018-04-07 23:55:14 GETTING OUT OF SYRIA IS NOT THE SAME AS MIDDLE EAST IT TOO COSTLY NEED SOME OIL RESERVES AT LEAST AIRBASES PORT FOOD!
3391 2018-04-07 23:55:12 [redacted] stans are brave strong we have control of oil we're brave...
3392 2018-04-07 23:54:39 But when you are dealing with the oil industry it might be wise...
3393 2018-04-07 23:54:25 Pruitt is a direct puppet for the oil and gas company's. Why? the bodyguards and SUV's to protect him from whom. Keep up the good work.
3394 2018-04-07 23:54:11 Where?
The oil fields!
3395 2018-04-07 23:53:43 sobrang hiwaga ng sunflower oil!!!!
3396 2018-04-07 23:53:32 So leave it and get the fuck out of the middle east ! What r u cowards looking for in "terrorist" countries besides oil and other ressources?
3397 2018-04-07 23:53:25 Might switch back to strictly weed bc even tho dabs get me more stoned I’m prone to stomach aches n actual herb helps more than oil (in my experience)
3398 2018-04-07 23:53:14 Dipping the bread in the Parmesan/olive oil mix 
3399 2018-04-07 23:52:56 It's not full of oil is it Ant

3402 2018-04-07 23:51:18 Yep, they make an engine slightly more fuel efficient, but charge twice as much for the oil and filter. #consumerdoesntwin #genvV8
3403 2018-04-07 23:51:11 It's 17h50 and I'm 9 beer deep.  Good oil change day haha

3405 2018-04-07 23:51:10 Makes me think that these protestors are funded by some US charities only to beat down Canada’s oil exports so they can take bigger share of world market.
Why they are not protesting for train taking same stuff??
3406 2018-04-07 23:51:04 fever causing you to hallucinate a standard oil derrick on your ass
3407 2018-04-07 23:51:00 The pinstriped suit debate begins and ends with the GOP. Surely a new day has dawned. How is CDA respected by other countries? How is our economy divesting & developing as oil dependency wanes?

3410 2018-04-07 23:50:26 also i smoke cannabis oil
3411 2018-04-07 23:50:20 Olive oil: in hair 
Hey ya: on repeat
Dance party: started
3412 2018-04-07 23:50:07 Ain’t nothing slick to a can of oil.
3413 2018-04-07 23:50:01 @rtnarch @NCBI take it with some CBD oil
3414 2018-04-07 23:50:00 Apply Engine oil. If symptoms remain after three days please consult your mechanic
3415 2018-04-07 23:49:51 they're p low calorie as far as candy goes so there's that if that matters. i'm also on the patch but that does nothing for my oral fixation. i also use these tea-tree oil infused toothpicks
3416 2018-04-07 23:49:47 Many things learned from NAs are still used is: rubber ,cotton,hypodermic needles , baby bottles and formula , oral contraceptives, pest control , discovery of oil ,pharmaceuticals. For some education should be mandatory.
3417 2018-04-07 23:49:22 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
3418 2018-04-07 23:49:19 So I have a medical Marijuana card, and I actually tried a couple different types of CBD oil, but it only seems to aggravate the depression and offers minimal relief for my anxiety. I accidentally overdosed and was hospitalized in early December of last year.
3419 2018-04-07 23:49:18 Why would you think Arab oil money is a good thing?
3420 2018-04-07 23:48:26 Jesus.  Butchers.  And we have an RU asset as POTUS who would rather give Putin a hot oil massage.
3421 2018-04-07 23:48:22 I know the feeling, I tried lavender essential oil.... use it in the shower, your sheets or pillows, it helps!!
3422 2018-04-07 23:48:19 Good thing we don’t need any of the revenue from the oil pipelines to keep paying for this.
3423 2018-04-07 23:47:52 idk if this is a reply tweet buuuut I’m gonna vote morrocan argan oil- very moody/musky and RARE
3424 2018-04-07 23:47:41 every time I wake up from a nap my face is like an oil refinery. im talkin crude oil. offshore drilling. barrels on barrels of imported oil.
3425 2018-04-07 23:47:39 I’ll assert to this; Misinformation inside networks is a key driver for Climate Change. It has all to do with marketing and how marketers create toxic-addictive content to lock in to oil consumer’s money.
3426 2018-04-07 23:47:32 i drank my organic matcha mct oil almond milk collagen grass fed butter drink 2 fast
3427 2018-04-07 23:47:32 I don’t think I have ever gotten an oil change without being told I need 100 different other things. Just change my freaking oil.
3428 2018-04-07 23:47:31 I’ve been doing that for years. Baby oil and a MAC highlighter from way back. And it didn’t transfer or make a mess. 
3429 2018-04-07 23:47:24 2,4-dithiapentane oil
3430 2018-04-07 23:47:03 Ending the addiction will not end the usefulness of oil in making myriad products. If done properly, the Middle East can stabilize and still be a major producer in energy, as in solar energy, once we figure out better means of storage.
3431 2018-04-07 23:46:59 I dropped my phone in oil wtf
3432 2018-04-07 23:46:54 Yes he will! All because of the oil/gas pipelines & the strategic positions in the surrounding areas to be gained from it.
3433 2018-04-07 23:46:45 I have combo skin and what I do is I use an oil cleanser one first and follow it up with one that's more soapy
3434 2018-04-07 23:46:28 Pengerahan oil boom utk melokalisir tumpahan minyak di teluk Bpn sebelum menyebar di sayangkan Pertamina  lambat menangani bahkan membantah .. pertamina harus bertanggung jawab kpd Nelayan dan pimpinan Pertamina di kaltim harus di ganti dan jadi tersangka.
3435 2018-04-07 23:46:08 Assad doesn't even control the oil and gas fields in syria I would hardly call that winning.
3436 2018-04-07 23:45:51 Tip: moisturize with coconut oil every night, wipe the excess oil off, rub the rest of the oil in, and rub a little bit of your everyday lotion in - your face will feel like a baby’s ass and your acne scars will go away
3437 2018-04-07 23:45:47 Ooo edgy progressive tweet..put some more beard oil on n earn even more social justice points
3438 2018-04-07 23:45:42 Who will protect me from infosec snake oil?

3441 2018-04-07 23:45:17 And that is why your government is in court about the abandoned oil wells,,because you all  thought the companies would pay.  Well, its your nickel and your mess.  Not my problem.
3442 2018-04-07 23:45:13 So Trump's claim "US now exporting more oil" is a  preemption?
3443 2018-04-07 23:45:10 Feel sorry for me if you wish, but if I was convinced by a few debunked studies and Internet cranks I'd be recommending my clients use turmeric instead of getting their families immunized and treating meningitis with oil of oregano.
3444 2018-04-07 23:44:46 It may not be real truffle oil, most truffle oil sold in the US has no actual truffle anything in it.
3445 2018-04-07 23:44:45 Do coconut oil masks at night to help your ends and maybe we can try thinning it out a little

3448 2018-04-07 23:44:21 Oil and gas are the ONLY items the middle east has, in quantity, and with sufficient value world wide to offer. Take that away and choas will ensue to even a greater measure. I do believe we need to get on renewable energy but it will kill the middle east.

3457 2018-04-07 23:43:11 Yeah there's no electrical plugs anywhere! The anxiety!
I would expect better from Mashable but I guess not. Throw you into the biased reporting of the oil companies. Easy skip of your site from now on.
3458 2018-04-07 23:42:40 Good cut off oil supply to BC and any federal money given to those tribes. They can all go f ck themselves
3459 2018-04-07 23:42:38 The oil field is TINY. Just ran into a guy that did pressure control for my old frac fleet 3 years ago.

3464 2018-04-07 23:42:21 I just bought a cool new Playstation 4  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
3465 2018-04-07 23:42:09 My skin has never looked as good as it does now bless this oil I bought
3466 2018-04-07 23:42:02 Coconut oil!!
3467 2018-04-07 23:41:59 You only Become a fan when the oil money came?...don't worry
3468 2018-04-07 23:41:55 Simply tell them "It's Oil Over!"
3469 2018-04-07 23:41:54 Trump isn’t worthy to be in the same sentence as JFK. However, Robbins and Trump are two of a kind-snake oil salesmen.
3470 2018-04-07 23:41:39 In that case, I guess Trump will sign an order for oil companies to be able to drill there like he did for the public lands in Utah.
3471 2018-04-07 23:41:37 I’m a slut for cerave eye repair, la roche-posay pigmentclar eyes, neutrogena hydrogel, the boots no7 eye creams are also nice. Also using a vitamin c serum before moisturizer helps a lot with brightness. Ooh also try bio oil on the darker spots!
3472 2018-04-07 23:41:35 .@TonyRobbins how dare you and what a low life weak ass man that you have to use your physical bulk and physically push back a woman and sexual assault survivor. You are a creep and a con man selling snake oil to the white man. Shame on you! #metoo
3473 2018-04-07 23:41:13 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
3474 2018-04-07 23:41:08 Heh, there are temples where the arcaka puts his own money to buy oil for the lamps. Imagine what he must be getting?
3475 2018-04-07 23:41:05 I need someone to rub my whole body in oil while I’m blindfolded. The. Rub my clit... preferably with their big dick.
3476 2018-04-07 23:41:04 Stolen gold, diamond, invading oil rich countries?..Stolen people?
Yeah, looting is hard work.
3477 2018-04-07 23:40:59 Never mind pipelines to international markets! How about pipelines to Ontario and the rest of CA.  We have no need of any imported oil if we had pipelines. We should be paying 40 cents per liter we have so much oil and can be self sufficient
3478 2018-04-07 23:40:54 My dad just called Ollie (my pup) Olive Oil...GONNA CRY NOW

3480 2018-04-07 23:40:28 Oil drilling & coal mining are killing endangered wildlife, polluting rivers, creating smog over wilderness in most treasured landscapes.
3481 2018-04-07 23:40:17 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
3482 2018-04-07 23:40:00 Right of the people. People's right. 
Your reading comprehension needs some work. 
For a well running car, the engine needs oil. We're the engine!
3483 2018-04-07 23:39:53 Yeah but I can do my own with a premium filter and synthetic oil at-cost.. Unless you can beat that, beat it kid
3484 2018-04-07 23:39:49 So the coconut oil makes it a water slide ?
3485 2018-04-07 23:39:43 Can you buy them in ford hall or anywhere where game tickets not required?
3486 2018-04-07 23:39:43 So then your oil and gas zealots are equally blind? Huh. Or petro-extremists? Maybe you should stick to your 'indistinguishable' grade 8 civics? If you have some free time read some Chomsky. It's edifying. Ciao.
3487 2018-04-07 23:39:40 Keep our lamps full of oil and keep watching. He is coming soon and He commanded us to watch.
3488 2018-04-07 23:39:22 That being said, neither of us have ANY idea how caloric those pizzas are, and they just dump truffle oil all over mine
3489 2018-04-07 23:39:18 the best things for burns are things that’ll take the heat out and/or have a numbing agent- apple cider vinegar, lavender essential oil, aloe vera, topical lidocaine... keep it clean and moisturized and don’t use ice right away. burns are the worst! feel better!
3490 2018-04-07 23:39:17 I need a giant fancy oil painting of me and my hound so I can hang it in my room
3491 2018-04-07 23:38:52 Oils: For oily skin, use something “thinner” with linoleic acid, like rosehip oil or safflower oil, or jojoba 
For dry skin, use something “thicker” with oleic acid, like shea butter or olive oil
Using oil-> your skin doesn’t need to overproduce sebum
Always patch test!
3492 2018-04-07 23:38:52 Shale oil isn’t the same thing as crude. There are many more times that in the Green River formation.
3493 2018-04-07 23:38:41 Oil and fossil fuel have had their day! The world is too weak and battered to stand for the devastation that more oil and coal will bring! We need clean air, water, and Natural Gas, solar panels, Turbine wind mills and freshening of the Oceans salt water will bring! We need hope!
3494 2018-04-07 23:38:22 Kemi oil is good stuff!
3495 2018-04-07 23:38:17 Yeah, I mean, I get that some ppl are more likely to follow thru if they are forking over money to something but there's this snail oil quality to it.

3499 2018-04-07 23:38:09 I did cocoa butter & coconut oil. Added vanilla extract and mica for shimmer. THANK YOU for the inspiration! I'm in love with my skin!
3500 2018-04-07 23:37:53 The sooner the world weans itself off of oil and gas addiction, the sooner the Middle East can achieve peace.
3501 2018-04-07 23:37:49 National security?
  Was it in our national interest, for BIG OIL to drill at the  UNITED STATES NAVAL OIL RESERVE, at  TEAPOT DOME??
3502 2018-04-07 23:37:38 Whenever I sleep with my oil diffuser on I have the deepest sleeps it’s insane.
3503 2018-04-07 23:37:14 @XavierBecerra Thank you sir, for standing up for what's right for the future of all, and the state of CA. We don't want offshore drilling. We don't want oil on CA shores, and we don't want an oil driven future! I stand with you, and I will be voting for you.

3506 2018-04-07 23:36:53 先週の練習でバイクが逝ってしまった

恐らくの原因は、ガソリンがシャバシャバになってたことらしいけど、OILを混ぜてないガソリンを入れてもこのような事にはならないらしい。
もう、意味が分からへん…。
誰が分かる人はいませんか？？？？

3509 2018-04-07 23:36:33 this rosehip oil better work for these scars 
3510 2018-04-07 23:35:50 I donf really have anything other than like baby oil / bio oil x
3511 2018-04-07 23:35:38 I almost wonder if we need to kind of.....mist everything else with oil first? And then remove it and kind of.....scuffle it off the deck?
3512 2018-04-07 23:35:26 tim allen, hero of the heartland on this show, owns a Cabelas-like place, and his wife works as a PhD geologist at an oil and gas company
3513 2018-04-07 23:35:26 LMAOOOOOO. Me lastnight, mixed oil into my moisturizer, then applied more on top!
3514 2018-04-07 23:35:25 Try baby oil, it may work
3515 2018-04-07 23:34:51 :( have you tried using an oil based cleanser instead? those are more gentle but also strong
3516 2018-04-07 23:34:19 Oh my even like olive oil might work? I’m pretty sure I’ve seen oil based things get it off
3517 2018-04-07 23:34:16 I think it’s funny when guys from the oil rigs come down to the valley act all verga DT buying girls drinks left and right spending chingos of cash for them just to say thanks for the drink and walk away. These girls stay finessing these niggas I swear

3521 2018-04-07 23:33:57 OIL RIG? LEO the lion goes GER? 

Maybe like some sort of weird metaphor about a trading system??? 
3522 2018-04-07 23:33:43 Investment leaves for some industry while gaining in others, see tech. also UPS and others investing. it's a cycle goes up & down. Look at 2012 and before. oil sector big outflow but they always come back when oil goes above 80, nothing new. Cnq always takes advantage of cycle
3523 2018-04-07 23:33:25 put tea tree oil and/or Neosporin on any pimples at night and it should be gone by the next morning
3524 2018-04-07 23:33:25 Coconut oil works wonders 
3525 2018-04-07 23:33:15 That is helpful. The stuff that tastes bad. Keep them polished always. And you can even use a nail oil that tastes a little goofy. I think cuccio is gross tasting. Their oils are great.
3526 2018-04-07 23:33:13 @realDonaldTrump -  Scott Pruitt is doing a great job!  He needs more security than prior because he is PO many activists!  I am a manager at an oil/gas company, the changes are appreciated!  THANK YOU!  MAGA!!
3527 2018-04-07 23:33:12 You use an oil-based cleanser, then a regular (usually foam) cleanser. I just used what I had on hand (coconut oil and biore charcoal wash) then toned with witch hazel.

3533 2018-04-07 23:31:54 skincare threads automatically lose credibility if they even mention putting coconut oil anywhere near your skin
3534 2018-04-07 23:31:43 Maybe something oil based? I don’t know but that’s what I’d do
3535 2018-04-07 23:31:42 There’s no better smell like sofrito sautéing in olive oil. Nothing better! #TasteofPuertoRico #Sofrito #FoodieFriday #foodtravelchat
3536 2018-04-07 23:31:25 If only successive UK governments had had the same approach to Scottish oil. It could have done so much good 
At least the SG is planning a not for profit energy company using renewable energy
3537 2018-04-07 23:31:17 The Company was kept in the family&so Musk family practices were applied.
He definitely sells snake oil.
His plan for 'free solar panels&batteries for 50,000 houses in South Australia',was notable for home owners not owning anything-electricity included-&having to buy it back.
3538 2018-04-07 23:31:02 And the olive oil soaks are everything 
3539 2018-04-07 23:30:40 Her nails are incredible. Important note though. Nail strengthened scan leave you vulnerable to breaks as they don’t allow for flexing of you jam your nail into something. Also jojoba oil on the cuticles and naked nails is incredible. Best oil for nails hands down.
3540 2018-04-07 23:30:07 if u ever think ur stupid just remember that yesterday i was ordering zalabiya and i had literally put in my mouth the second it cAME OUT OF THE OIL AND INTO H O T MELTED WHIYE CHOCOLATE and i burnt my tongue €:

3551 2018-04-07 23:28:19 Russia has access to huge oil reserves in the Caspian sea. The oil companies think the reserves there could be bigger than the Arabian oil fields...

3555 2018-04-07 23:26:25 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

3563 2018-04-07 23:23:28 Why is #DotardChump so eager to put more poison in the air and water? More jobs created in clean energy, healthier people (especially 4 children) mean less strain on healthcare. No such thing as clean oil or gas, #CleanCoal is a JOKE!! just like #Spanky!
3564 2018-04-07 23:23:07 Reverse migration is a joke.  The tax cut got me an extra 400 a month. I am nowhere near the top. No snake oil the wall will work. Every country that has built one has seen great results

3573 2018-04-07 23:21:54 Create a PanAfrican golden dinar to circumvent central banking? Death sentence. Sell oil in Euros to circumvent the petro dollar? Death sentence. Sell oil in Yuan to circumvent the petro dollar? Perfect timing.

3575 2018-04-07 23:21:53 We have oil, yes. But we can't do anything with it because socialism has destroyed all the refineries and other installations for processing.

3619 2018-04-07 23:13:38 Just made some. Mix melted coconut oil, unsweetened cocoa, chopped almonds (or other nuts) and preferred sweetener. Smooth mixture on parchment paper or pour it onto a plate. Put it in the freezer for 20 or 30 minutes. Impress your friends. You made candy.

3638 2018-04-07 23:10:07 The money and the motive has always been more on the oil companies and their investors by something on the order of 1000 times, and recent discoveries show that the oil companies knew global warming would be an issue a long time ago.

3653 2018-04-07 23:06:37 US is loving this as it gets about a 50% discount on our oil as we can't reach other markets. Where does the Idiot Fringe think their welfare cheques will come from if they trash the economy? Throw 'em in jail.

3655 2018-04-07 23:06:32 I actually agree with both of you. EV’s will grower quicker than expected (more specifically, miles traveled on EV’s due to Level 4/5 autonomy), but oil demand will continue to grow regardless for some time due to China/India crossing critical per-capita income levels. Thanks!
3656 2018-04-07 23:06:23 The dude has made a mint selling snake oil for years. Why would anyone be shocked by this ?
3657 2018-04-07 23:06:07 Okay. *his own breath is labored, his voice still rough. He struggles a bit to life his head, looking at the oil rig*

Where is here?
3658 2018-04-07 23:06:02 I suppose that should be up to the recipients to tell if they have relief or not. 
Not some medical expert that's not ill and is likely not making money from the remedy.

So who cares what he says! Everyone is out selling their own brand of snake oil.
3659 2018-04-07 23:05:58 I read online that adding olive oil to your bath helps with eczema and I put too much in and now my tub is an oil slick and I smell like sauceless pasta
3660 2018-04-07 23:05:35 Need to see Zionist billionaires ( Rockefeller is a crypto Jew )work as a team & are in league with Saudi Arabia since oil is a competitive product that may lose 1/2 its market ei energy or transport. Had 3 parties been honest pipelines would be built yrs ago cut world oil prices

3662 2018-04-07 23:05:06 That's false.  Israel has non binding resolutions against it for sport.  It started in the 70s during the oil crisis.  It have the arab league power. Even calling the area occupied is a joke.
3663 2018-04-07 23:04:59 Gotta get that coconut oil spray
3664 2018-04-07 23:04:56 Have you tried Olive oil (two or three drops in the ears) warm or cold may also work. Obviously plug ya ears up after with cotton wool. Wouldn’t want ya to wreck ya pillow cases
3665 2018-04-07 23:04:23 You have a recipe for chips n cheese? What, do you milk the bloody cow yersel?? Do you fry the chips in oil you’ve squeezed outta olives with your bare hands?
3666 2018-04-07 23:04:15 My aunt made a blanket washing solution. Lux flakes Eucalyptus oil and not sure what else. Soaked the blankets in warm solution. Put through hand mangle. Washed in old fashioned washing machine. Rinsed then put through hand mangle. She washed all of the families wool blankets.
3667 2018-04-07 23:04:06 Pruitt is the definition of the swamp don't become a fraud. I like some of your views.He is destroying the environment i know BIG OIL OWN YOU GUYS Exxon lied to us for years.Dont become fake news.

3670 2018-04-07 23:03:39 N likes his VERY well done, so they had to go back on the stove but then everyone ate them! I can’t make them during the week tho bc H totally had 68 urgent needs during the process that would NOT have mixed well with frying hot oil.
3671 2018-04-07 23:03:36 The onions were chopped so fine the almost liquified in the oil. Chef Curdle cooks again!!

3673 2018-04-07 23:02:54 don’t you just hate it when you touch your glasses by the lenses by accident and they become all smeared with oil and it is literally impossible to clean off without a microfiber cloth?

I would make it a law to make the lenses oleophobic so this would never happen again.
3674 2018-04-07 23:02:54 But they have oil because they deserve it, you know - great values, hard workers and all; and that's why oil was over there, and not here in QC, or in NB, or ON. It's deserved.  Totally not good old luck.
3675 2018-04-07 23:02:48 @terrychristian oh Terry thought you better than that bitter oil what about the most Nasty Snarling Narcistic Bourino shaming the g8 club and istory and tradition as he called it.Then we beat Liverpool Chelsea Manchester United what is wrong with the Special C***
3676 2018-04-07 23:02:24 I had a co-worker in the '90's who had all sorts of breathing issues - after returning from the Gulf War. I think he said they denied his claims too, because that'd mean admitting to the oil fires, depleted uranium all over and god only knows what else the Pentagon was resp. 4.

3687 2018-04-07 23:01:18 Jason, times were good before US fracking companies found so much oil they crashed the price of oil. 

Intelligent taxation does not stifle growth. Money spent by governments is the same as money spent by companies. Fraser Institute is not a university.

3704 2018-04-07 22:59:25 I also take it that you have had a chat with Dr Joseph Mercola at one stage. This guy saved my life over 3 yrs ago from a serious stroke from very bad LDL due to cooking with canola oil, grape seed oil from the suoer market ..
3705 2018-04-07 22:59:05 He was one of the men who made my heart throb.  I used to know a young man who looked exactly like Tyrone, he was a sweetie who worked in the oil field in West Texas.  I have no idea where he is now.

3709 2018-04-07 22:58:22 I choose a yummy plate of beans porridge with fried plantain and croaker fish, because beans is good source of protein and can reduce high bp, fish there can supply u with minerals and oil and plantain will equally make your mouth watery
3710 2018-04-07 22:58:14 No prob. Go snag the el milagro corn tortillas from the tienda. They are like $1.25 or something like that for ~25/30 shells in a package. Flash fry in some oil. They are amazing for at home tacos.

3715 2018-04-07 22:56:58 He's always been a snake oil salesman
3716 2018-04-07 22:56:57 Because the oil oligarchs in this country like him.
3717 2018-04-07 22:56:56 Per capita, Quebec is the fifth highest province for equalization payment. But remove oil and the prairies would all be on top of the list.
3718 2018-04-07 22:56:34 Qué rico el oil
3719 2018-04-07 22:56:34 But they self-regulate... they told “us” this wouldn’t happen. Oh well, we reap what we sow. Next oil disaster will be off the coast of California. Our “new normal”
3720 2018-04-07 22:56:28 A great day outside. 2 oil changes and 8 tires rotated. Cars good for another 7500 miles.
3721 2018-04-07 22:56:17 King Faud of SA was tight with Bush dynasty! Gulf War to protect Kuwait and House of Saud oil. Weapons factories in Basra taken out in Persian Gulf War. Vets exposed to blood agents.
3722 2018-04-07 22:56:08 Trump has no idea how to run the office of Presidentif these United States.  Obviously he’s going to continue to allow America  to go downhill.  He’s allowing oil to completely contaminate our oceans. When will you see that?
3723 2018-04-07 22:56:05 just bought beard growth oil tired of waiting
3724 2018-04-07 22:55:45 If you really meant business, you'd get an F-350 diesel and roll coal.
3725 2018-04-07 22:55:21 U Are going to be a regular ole citizen real soon.  You can surround ur self with lead paint chips, un-safe drinking water and bathe in an oil spill for as long as u want.  #countdown
3726 2018-04-07 22:55:14 No to new oil rigs - how disgusting Pruitt. How disgusting is Trump - how do I hate their policies? I really can't count the ways. When will these weasles be in jail?
3727 2018-04-07 22:55:08 The minute I hear TAR sands rather than oil sands, I instantly think the person is dumber than me. A tall order no less.
3728 2018-04-07 22:55:01 Maybe. But silver has a positive correlation with oil in the last few trading hours. And oil does not look good...
3729 2018-04-07 22:54:58 Putin wants us out..so the oil deals have clearer access for transport.
3730 2018-04-07 22:54:28 God knows, he's a snake oil salesman
3731 2018-04-07 22:54:24 @ElizabethII I think $VNOM will be fine, unless oil collapses, the relationship with $FANG in the Permian is the cat’s pajamas-low debt too!
3732 2018-04-07 22:54:07 PSA: Auto Parts Stores recycle Oil and Filters for for free! Do the environment a favor and drop it off no cost.
3733 2018-04-07 22:54:04 And if Pemex knew about the oil why didnt they bid for the fields in Round 1.2? Or announce anything prior to that either.
3734 2018-04-07 22:54:03 Most profit comes at costs to society that we don't measure.  Otherwise oil companies would have to pay the cost of making air absolutely pristine. Gas prices would be prohibitive. You are paying part of their profit by breathing dirty air.
3735 2018-04-07 22:54:02 Oil show then bath show tonight? I miss you guys and I'm feeling super better 
3736 2018-04-07 22:53:54 What a crap day. 

@AlbionRFC lose to Hull.

Our team coach hits a Hull players car.

Then an oil line ruptures, stuck at Hull.

Now it’s midnight, and we still have 3 hours to drive. 

Could anything else go wrong??
3737 2018-04-07 22:53:46 None of this crap was happening before your governments went it to those regions and wanted oil and lithium. What did Iraq do to deserve what happened to them cuz the went involved in 9/11.
3738 2018-04-07 22:53:43 Lap 36, Coons' car goes up in smoke and flame on the front straight. He jumps out and is okay. Oil dry is now being applied to the track surface.
3739 2018-04-07 22:53:26 .@realDonaldTrump donnie a factoid for you. You are really fat.  Your hero Il Duce had a sure fire cure for obesity...castor oil. Trust me. Drink about a quart a day and you will lose weight. Believe me. Not fake news
3740 2018-04-07 22:53:16 He's never been anything but a snake oil salesman.
3741 2018-04-07 22:53:07 Looks like another win for big oil ; another loss for the environment.
#moneytalks
3742 2018-04-07 22:52:59 Shower, pre-shave oil (sometimes), and a luxurious warm lather
3743 2018-04-07 22:52:59 And all they care about is getting all these oil pipelines up and polluting the water even more so it's sickening and sad I really wish a good positive change would come
3744 2018-04-07 22:52:56 Nothing like a good old oil spill to create employment! #sarcasm
3745 2018-04-07 22:52:55 The future is CBD oil.

#TakeAKnee #WeRise @VoteVets #VetsVsHate #WomansVote #VotingRights #HandsOffMyBC #DMVFollowers #UniteBlue #TDS how will oil rig drilling affect Navy CG or cruise traffic? Cost?
3747 2018-04-07 22:52:41 Wish it burned to the ground!
And put your oil rigs off the coast of Mar a Lago since they’re so important to you.
3748 2018-04-07 22:52:27 He was the best looking guy in the White House, would have worked there just to enjoy my day
Melania eventually will go and be with some hotelier or oil magnet who won't cheat lie or look like that. 
The last time the White House was a rockin was January 19th 2016 thanks Obamas
3749 2018-04-07 22:52:02 WE CAN GO TO 13BIILLION MILES WITH VOYAGER VEGER, WE CAN GO TO THE MOON, SPACE STATION BUT CANT DRILL OIL SAFELY, HMMMMM DISCONNECT, SCREW ENVIRONMENTALIST, THEY ARE MENTAL
3750 2018-04-07 22:51:59 Peel a #cedro (smell its rind: so gorgeous), slice it and eat it all dressed with olive oil, salt and ground pepper. Some even put chilly, honey & jam! #Sicily #SicilyCulture.
3751 2018-04-07 22:51:48 Was gonna change my oil tomorrow... But decided I need to see Quiet Place instead
#priorities
3752 2018-04-07 22:51:46 Why are we so hooked up on oil? Look for sustainable solutions it is the way forward. #Sustainability
3753 2018-04-07 22:51:40 Oil has weakened our local production capabilities. We need to remove the effect of curse of natural resources from our system
3754 2018-04-07 22:51:35 He lives in California, it's legal. Get some medical cannabis oil.
3755 2018-04-07 22:51:35 Nice job guys...classy move
3756 2018-04-07 22:51:32 ยันหว่างง  เอาไงดีลูกกกก
3757 2018-04-07 22:51:23 i'm legit buying the original snake oil game on amazon right now. That $50 amazon card is being used for important things. 
also yes this is 100% because @JennaJulien make me want to play it with my group of shit friends.
3758 2018-04-07 22:51:23 I work in a shop where we sell CBD oil, and am overwhelmed at the positive response from customers buying it,  People with Epilepsy, Stroke, Lukemia, Anxiety, return to get the product to help them cure themselves, I only wish the Medicinal Version that Ava needs were permitted.
3759 2018-04-07 22:51:11 See that’s where you are wrong. Not 1ml less oil gets used if you block KM. Not 1. You just ensure Trump and co ship more. And since Alberta oil is lower CO2 now there is no excuse.
3760 2018-04-07 22:51:10 I also got this bee venom hydrating mist from nature republic & an apple cleansing oil from innisfree.
3761 2018-04-07 22:51:04 Also, poor kids with no jobs, no mentors nor training become soldiers to fight the oil wars of Exxon, Cheney, the Saudis et al.
3762 2018-04-07 22:51:00 Up there with BP saying an oil spill in the Oz bite would be good economically for OZ.
3763 2018-04-07 22:50:53 Which oil leak off Louisiana? Deep water horizon? THAT'S NOT A FUCKING PIPELINE!
3764 2018-04-07 22:50:42 #ImStillWithHer #AMJOY @maddow #russiagate #workWOKE #Indivisible #RestoreTheVRA
#TakeAKnee #WeRise @VoteVets #VetsVsHate #WomansVote #VotingRights #HandsOffMyBC #DMVFollowers how is FL only state exempt from oil drilling? Mar-a-Lago protected? FUBAR if oil spill, eh?
3765 2018-04-07 22:50:17 This is comparable to fries with canned gravy and oil white "cheeze" being called poutine. It's about what you can expect at most event locations though. We are still miles behind the Japanese on delicious food being everywhere.
3766 2018-04-07 22:50:04 Sweet! Sure man. Save me a bottle of the oil for when you move up here 
3767 2018-04-07 22:50:03 You are so right @rattlebaby06!  My husband is oil delivery driver. Your post gets a  from me.  #KindnessEveryDay
3768 2018-04-07 22:49:55 I've heard many say it helps reduce the pain, but it doesn't work for everyone. Thankfully, there is CBD oil as well, which doesn't give the "high." I just hate how terrible some pharmaceuticals are on your liver and stomach. It's good to have alternatives.
3769 2018-04-07 22:49:45 Full shift today.. Again..

Need to collect 10 days OIL. 
3770 2018-04-07 22:49:39 Sorry but the interviewer missed that most important crimes that Pruitt is committing. Perkins was never asked about the destruction of environmental regulations and handouts to Pruitt's friends at working in the gas and oil industries.
3771 2018-04-07 22:49:38 Without oil Saudi economy would not be better than Yemen . Turkey is becoming industrialized country under leadership of Erdogan. If they find gas fields they will do better many European countries. Only problem for turkey they have to buy oil and gas for it's industries.
3772 2018-04-07 22:49:37 Oprah and her show peddled Tony Robbins and every new age snake oil guru that came down the pike.  She peddled The Secret book + one guru had deaths from overheating at an event.  A lot of this is cult like.
3773 2018-04-07 22:49:37 Body lava will be the new coconut/rosehip oil like I’m about to fix all my porblems with one lil dab
3774 2018-04-07 22:49:25 Concentrate on the oil spewing bikes you own.
3775 2018-04-07 22:49:23 Started putting pure argan oil on my face and hair, and it's so soft

3778 2018-04-07 22:48:51 Which? The vinegar one? It’s good for dry hair so def good for my curls. The hot oil block is on a popsicle stick and is melted with hot water. It supposedly helps with dry hair & dry scalp. Stoked.
3779 2018-04-07 22:48:47 Please don’t give up Charlene!!! What about CBD oil? Start researching it. I’m not on it yet. The fight isn’t over yet. Praying for you 
3780 2018-04-07 22:48:42 Psychological Snake Oil Salesman.
3781 2018-04-07 22:48:41 おはよう
3782 2018-04-07 22:48:13 And nor should they be
It is not the EPAs job to give the oil industry a happy ending. Pruitts appointment was disgraceful with clear and obvious conflicts of interest
3783 2018-04-07 22:48:12 @Starbucks how about some coffee to fuel us T1D moms who burn the midnight oil keeping our kids alive 24/7/365 ??
3784 2018-04-07 22:47:58 Oh god that's horrid  Peppermint oil in my temples really helps me. (for some v bad ones I have dumped some on my head before! the smell and the tingling somehow helps.)
3785 2018-04-07 22:47:41 “Yeah yeah and do you know what that is? It’s oil” 
3786 2018-04-07 22:47:32 Yo times like this make me realize my family is always #1
3787 2018-04-07 22:47:16 @indSupremeCourt are you the whole of chidambaram like rich and congressi politicians???
I think all judges should be sent to jail.
@narendramodi totally upset with you for your INACTION. अगर होता नहीं है तो घर जाओ। और स्वामी जी को आने दो। 
@BJP4India @AmitShah @OpIndia_com
3788 2018-04-07 22:46:57 Based on false reporting by MSM and the exposed agenda of destabilization, oil pipelines controlled by the West etc I would be careful about trusting establishment sources on anything in this area #Propaganda
3789 2018-04-07 22:46:54 At the very least - tie their handouts to our prosperity. (Example - #EnergyEast should be a no brainer). 
We should also tax foreign oil and give those taxes directly to Oil-Producing provinces for R&D and investment for continued safer infrastructure.
3790 2018-04-07 22:46:52 Frogs and toads are the same animal! They just shapeshift!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
3791 2018-04-07 22:46:38 Let's be honest though mate, once Liverpool beat you on Tuesday your season is no more impressive than Leicester City's. Except they didn't need a sketchy oil crook to bankroll them
3792 2018-04-07 22:46:36 As someone who Instructed sea survival & fire fighting for the oil and gas sector, I feel qualified to say that no one benifits from a rig disaster.  Let us remember that the US south coast will never recover from the inadequate environmental response from BP to the spill there.
3793 2018-04-07 22:46:19 I got the rosy cheeks mask - it’s in my fridge now. I also got the damaged hair hot oil mask solid block thing & a sample of their vinegary hair mask, can’t remember what it’s called.
3794 2018-04-07 22:46:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and the number of Border Patrol Stations.
3795 2018-04-07 22:45:40 I don't know y some men are just wicked, how can a man b having sex with is own daughter?
 We understand that she's ur property bt mind u not all ur properties that u have assess to, just like the Niger delta crude oil & the federal government 
#WTJ
3796 2018-04-07 22:44:59 You must not work with industrialized portion of the US. Companies providing oil, gas, natural resources, transportation, air freight & travel, airports, shipping, etc. stifling regulations, unfunded, requiring additional process, software, hardware, administration...
3797 2018-04-07 22:44:39 i'm bout to face like 2 g's of oil to the face rn
3798 2018-04-07 22:44:31 Insanity. The reinsert un Burnaby is currently expanding. If it had more access to oil, it would expand even more, say like the Transmountain pipeline. NDP just truly don’t understand how the world even works.
3799 2018-04-07 22:44:28 To firm breasts and tighten the skin, mix one teaspoon of vitamin E oil with one tablespoon of yogurt and an egg.
3800 2018-04-07 22:43:50 Tony Robbins is a charlatan who built a billion dollar empire by selling his self-help snake oil to the easily duped, but that's ok. What's not ok is him criticizing #MeToo. 

People who feed at the trough of American capitalism doth squeal too much.
3801 2018-04-07 22:43:38 YES! Thank you for that.  Tony’s attempt at intimidation did not dissuade the challenger either, but it concerns me.  He went AT HER. That one clip told me EVERYTHING I EVER need to know about this snake oil salesman & his fear of castration.

3803 2018-04-07 22:43:10 Sounds suspiciously like snake oil. Should be nice and easy for the existing CRM companies to offer a CDP product on top - they just need to add an Alexa integration!
3804 2018-04-07 22:43:00 That block looks like a 3D core of the Morrison sand hydrocarbon formation I have 4 Oil wells in.
3805 2018-04-07 22:43:00 Was it me or did I just get threatened that if I’m too attractive I won’t get hired? I have tried very hard over the years to understand why people buy the snake oil you sell. #whatdegree?
3806 2018-04-07 22:42:17 Too much coconut oil
3807 2018-04-07 22:42:02 oilちゃんおはよ～!!
おやありでした(*´ω`*)
3808 2018-04-07 22:41:36 Must be dreaming. Just got my oil changed and talked to Comcast customer service with a raging hangover and I didn't want to scream or go on a murderous rampage.
3809 2018-04-07 22:41:36 I still use the Pink oil moisturizer
3810 2018-04-07 22:40:53 You DO realize that TAR is a derivative of COAL, not oil???
3811 2018-04-07 22:40:12 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
3812 2018-04-07 22:40:06 Am with anointing oil
3813 2018-04-07 22:39:53 Occasionally I hit oil in the ground thank you sir lol
3814 2018-04-07 22:39:53 Retweeted Stonewall Jackson (@1776Stonewall):

what Trump has done for American Energy Independence is amazing. Opening ANWR and and there's going to be drilling in all 48 Continental States. We're going to be the biggest oil supplier in the world. Trillions of dollars
3815 2018-04-07 22:39:37 I found it. I always thought he was a snake oil salesman type. Now he’s that plus a pig 
3816 2018-04-07 22:39:35 Think you need to read it again.  BTW 8Mmbbl/d, by 2040, will be about a 7% mitigation factor.  And that is using the low oil demand forecast and high integration of EV's forecast. I'm all for EV's by the way, but their impact of oil consumption will be much less than thought.
3817 2018-04-07 22:39:25 Found out that the dessert I really wanted to try in Solvang is cooked in peanut oil. 
3818 2018-04-07 22:39:15 @BarackObama was/is a corporatist. Voted for him, but he bombed for oil too. @SenSanders was screwed by @DNC when @HillaryClinton manipulated the rules and money. Most "Dems" are just centralist republicans at this point. Where is glass-stegall? All Lobyists should be banned, now
3819 2018-04-07 22:39:14 GOOD BEAUTIFUL SATURDAY EVENING FIXING TO HAVE A FUN SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE WORK MEETING! #AMERICAN #Oil NEVER SLEEPS!:) CHINA RUSSIA IRAN JUST SIT DOWN YOUR ALL #OIL RUDE! #OIL = #FREEDOM!
3820 2018-04-07 22:38:33 Deep frying veggies can be risky. Splashed hot oil on my arm. Still burning. Keeping ice on it — feeling pained
3821 2018-04-07 22:38:25 Dang 1,3,4,6 & 11 THRU 15 . Shall we have a braid spray, oil sheen, and perm kit competition next ?!?!

3824 2018-04-07 22:37:37 I want the Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Serum. I’ve bought two of the travel size ones that come with the marula oil and I LOVE it.

Well wow... I'm actually getting into this coupon clippy thingy now that I can do it all on my phone.  I just got 120 off my 280 grocery bill!.  And they paid me 4 bucks to take my Fish oil gummies off their hands!!

WOOT!!!
3828 2018-04-07 22:36:26 “Essential” oil
3829 2018-04-07 22:36:16 I am not a Oil fan, but a great salute to a very hard situation and time.
3830 2018-04-07 22:35:59 Families across America are breathing a lot worse thanks to the terrible environmental destruction being done to profit big oil and other big corporations by the former environmental PROTECTION agency @EPA @EPAScottPruitt
3831 2018-04-07 22:35:42 How Jamaican are you? 

Carry Scandal bag guh shop and soda/rum bottle fi buy oil
3832 2018-04-07 22:35:15 Hahaha
3833 2018-04-07 22:35:12 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
3834 2018-04-07 22:35:06 Oil
3835 2018-04-07 22:34:54 Who thought snake oil could get worse?
3836 2018-04-07 22:34:32 American has largest number of think tanks on middle east. Yet their past foreign policy was so much ignorant of history. Did they so easily believe the oil barons, Saudi bigots and Israeli lobby that toppling Assad will be a video game.
3837 2018-04-07 22:34:04 The History of Emu oil is much older than most of us think, the benefits of the oil were discovered quite some time ago. It has been used in Australian aborigine medicine for {{{thousands of years}}}, relieving aches and pains healing bruises, wounds .as old as weed ->LIKE ME 
3838 2018-04-07 22:33:51 Except it’s not always powered and you said it yourself it takes 8 hours to charge. Let’s hope no power outages. Oil/gas will still be more efficient. If you lived on the mainland waiting 8 hours for your car to charge will take you longer to get where you are going.
3839 2018-04-07 22:33:42 I want to see your nose ring!!! 
I have a bull ring too and my family always jokes about tying a rope to it and walking me around like a bull 
3840 2018-04-07 22:33:30 Just had donner at an Italuan restaurant with no vegan options other than grilled veg-hold the butter and oil.  Our server said there is a food truck thing every 2 weeks.  Love king for a vegan truck partner
3841 2018-04-07 22:33:11 I don't claim to be an expert on things, but the vibe I get just from Tony Robbins' face is not a good one.

In fact, those type of "self-help" speakers all feel like Snake Oil Salesmen, IMO.
3842 2018-04-07 22:32:57  Oil changed  Full detail car wash
3843 2018-04-07 22:32:51 encasing myself in the smell of candles and smearing lilac oil on my arms 
im good.
3844 2018-04-07 22:32:49 Yell all you want but we know this is all about campaign ego, nothing else.  Your fly over base gets that you are a snake oil salesman and they think it's OK.  So,if you like tem tat much, invite tem to shit-hole-a-Lago to thank them.  You won't.  They have no donor monies.
3845 2018-04-07 22:32:28 I'll stick with this snake oil, thank you.
3846 2018-04-07 22:32:25 Why not heavy oil gets higher margins and lower volumes of bottoms
3847 2018-04-07 22:32:04 I'm an employee working tonight.. I cannot legally buy a ticket while working the same game.
3848 2018-04-07 22:31:41 Obama's actions were all pre Russian aggression in Crimea. How about the Magnitsky Act. The prohibition on sharing of oil exploration technology that Exxon and Tillerson championed
3849 2018-04-07 22:31:33 Time to oil up the Samizdat presses.
3850 2018-04-07 22:31:31 And Alberta is still the most prosperous province. No tears for the oil patch

3853 2018-04-07 22:31:13 What's for dinner?
Sauteed kale, cabbage and garlic in olive oil, diced baked sweet potatoes and 
lemon-pepper tuna steaks!

3860 2018-04-07 22:29:41 Syria is another incidence of NATO aggression partially targeting Russia although oil & pipelines are among other interests. Nevertheless, Russia still only spends at best 10% of the amount the US spends on "Defence". Russia is less "rotten to the core" than the UK or US.

3862 2018-04-07 22:29:00 It is the perfect example that you can be
1. floating on a massive pool of oil
2. have the entire north be fish-rich ocean
3. have jungle
4. have farm-friendly land
and STILL have starvation, etc. due to decades of socialist nonsense impeding markets, local cap. accumulation, etc

3867 2018-04-07 22:28:10 Amazing the picture is slipping on the page. So much hair oil...
3868 2018-04-07 22:28:03 my moms ass was really about to have us all in here scorched before I stopped her from trying to put out an oil fire with some damn water 
3869 2018-04-07 22:27:57 @realDonaldTrump or what it must have been like for the 5000 troops fighting on the ground with Iraquis and with no warning the Commander in Chief says they should steal their oil!  They have no idea the country just heard tbat our president suggested they should commit a crime.
3870 2018-04-07 22:27:33 Who is surprised??
And the aquifer will be affected, because that’s how underground oil spills work. 
Can we say “told you so!”?
3871 2018-04-07 22:27:21 I use coconut oil instead of shaving cream. Then just rub all the oil in once I’m done

3879 2018-04-07 22:26:08 Hehehe
3880 2018-04-07 22:26:07 That's awesome! !
3881 2018-04-07 22:26:03 Yeah I have two oil paintings! There is some really nice stuff!
3882 2018-04-07 22:26:03 Absolutely. Nothing makes me roll my eyes harder than the old argument of ‘it’s only a small fraction of their total diet’ and ‘it’s a by product of the palm oil industry anyway’
3883 2018-04-07 22:25:59 Cause I don’t think it’s great. I think they should be doing A lot more. Directing money to Humboldt that is not even their own money is a “nice” gesture but FAR from great.
3884 2018-04-07 22:25:28 I tried to take the oil off my bed with my hand to try save the product and the glass just ended up all over my hands

3887 2018-04-07 22:24:48 I pretty much assume that every oil spill is at least double the initial "estimate".
3888 2018-04-07 22:24:46 American has largest number of think tanks on middle east. Yet their past foreign policy was so much ignorant of history. Did they so easily believe the oil barons, Saudi bigots and Israeli lobby that toppling Assad will be a video game.
3889 2018-04-07 22:24:29 chiro is a life saver for my migraines. Have you tried M-grain oil from young living. I don’t sell it, it’s just a huge help!
3890 2018-04-07 22:24:12 NO problem. As I said, the branches, as a rule, would tell the renter to get the oil change and they would reimburse. I just cannot guarantee this because it does come down to a local decision. If you are not happy with $$$, contact my team once car has been returned. Chris M

3897 2018-04-07 22:23:10 I'm positive that the US govt knows that it's the rebels doing the gassing. This war is about oil & hegemony. It was never about big bad Assad; that's just what the State Department's lapdogs in the media say to keep the American sheeple compliant for illegal war.

3903 2018-04-07 22:21:04 Manufacturing was leaving the US long before Obama. If you want to blame regs blame OSHA for that. Joke of course. Renewables has brought thousands of jobs and oil & gas are just fine. I work with oil companies so I know. You want air like China? Then keep Pruitt #goodgrief
3904 2018-04-07 22:20:53 Are you leaving the Oil also @_JeffNash
3905 2018-04-07 22:20:53 we want the Dakotas (oil) and Minnesota would likely rather be with us.

Not that of the people
They all want to ban:

Nuclear

Fracking

Keep everything in the ground, stop manufacturing, stop the country!
Seems all the parties have gone hard left!
The people will rise up angry soon, when fuel stops!
3932 2018-04-07 22:16:23 The US is consistent. They want regional stability. By which they mean they control Kirkuk oil and Caspian gas, and they don't care who has to die.
3933 2018-04-07 22:16:21 I think Andrew Wilson made clear a while back that new economic case will be made that excludes oil.  Needs to appeal to small c conservative Scotland. Papers on pound and EU will be interesting.

3936 2018-04-07 22:16:07 How much you charge for a oil change

3938 2018-04-07 22:15:56 Would you've liked a regime change.
Like Lybia. And #USA cashing all the oil. How is that even possible that when you invade a country you can kill ppl and get the oil - no justice.
3939 2018-04-07 22:15:43 He may be paranoid & afraid for his stupid life for whatever reason, but I think it's more just that he knows he can use all the money he wants for whatever he wants and no one is going to stop him cause the oil companies are paying Trump big bucks to make sure he's never fired.

3988 2018-04-07 22:09:24 The actual president is finishing off with the country, selling all of the assets and giving away its oil reserves without any benefit for the nation or its people, when the opposite should be the way !
3989 2018-04-07 22:09:19 Nobody is "stealing" their oil.
3990 2018-04-07 22:08:45 People stoppped paying attention just like the oil leaked at keystone .
3991 2018-04-07 22:08:42 If you get terra cotta pots, you have to season them (usually soak them in water, then oil them and bake without anything in) whereas silicone one can be used straight after washing and they bounce, if you drop them
3992 2018-04-07 22:08:42 Join @GreenpeaceUK by calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. #ProtectAntarctic RETWEET to show Boots we mean business
3993 2018-04-07 22:08:39 Sounds like a corolla oil check
3994 2018-04-07 22:08:34 Why not just say “that’s great” and move on?
3995 2018-04-07 22:08:32 Be wasting Ororo and Pears Baby Oil to do “Melanin popping “ 
  Now I know why Oil cost for market ..sigh
3996 2018-04-07 22:07:54 Trump has his home in Florida, not CA.
Clearly he doesn't want oil spills tarnishing the coast anywhere near his property.
3997 2018-04-07 22:07:29 Okay so, @SamGolbach
Needs these 3 things next time. Tape. Banana. Super Glue. 
Tape @ColbyBrock to his bed, leave a banana for him to munch on, bc hes a fucking monkey.  And then glue the door shut. Maybe put oil on his floor to. THAT WOULD MAKE HIM A FLYING MONKEY. Ha. Laugh...
3998 2018-04-07 22:07:19 That was a job offer not an apology mate. £600m. No less. They have enough oil money.
3999 2018-04-07 22:07:06 @EPAScottPruitt has advanced one of the admin's most aggressive regulatory rollbacks, including regulations intended to tighten rules related to coal plants, oil & gas drilling, auto & truck air emissions, & pesticides."

4001 2018-04-07 22:06:50 Name of the oil??
4002 2018-04-07 22:06:46 If we want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.

4003 2018-04-07 22:06:22 Solid move.  Kudos to @Oil_Foundation
4004 2018-04-07 22:06:02 America will simply use this attack to justify a permanent stay in Syria and controlling the Oil and gas fields in deir ezzor permanently.
4005 2018-04-07 22:05:52 @LindaMoeketsi What's the name of the oil you using and where can one find it?

4009 2018-04-07 22:05:19 My S&W Shield is still being a good girl. There has been NO fraternizing with her friend “Ammo”. I told them “good job” and left them extra gun oil & brass cleaner as @ treat.
4010 2018-04-07 22:05:09 “Net proceeds”....sincerely hope the Oilers and @RogersPlace waive the 50/50 admin fees.
4011 2018-04-07 22:05:00 I just finished co-washing it. So I separated the hair in four sections, put in leave in conditioner, detangled it with my fingers then my denman brush and applied gel (a mixture of the Coconut Oil and Argan Oil Eco-Styler)
4012 2018-04-07 22:04:39 Just look at what they’re doing to Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or Bristol Bay! Big oil liquefied natural gas to be drilled in the Arctic and the national wildlife refuge & pebble mine to open up and destroy Bristol Bay The worlds largest wild salmon spawning grounds
4013 2018-04-07 22:04:29 I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THIS ONE i love her work now it’s exactly what I strive for in my own stuff it’s so cool to see it in old oil paintings
4014 2018-04-07 22:04:27 Wtf? Oil on cardboard makes it useless garbage? And a coffee cup obviously has some coffee in it so what's the point at all? That leaves what, newspaper?
4015 2018-04-07 22:04:11 Ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
4016 2018-04-07 22:03:36 I’m moving to North Dakota where the oil riggs are to find a husband

4019 2018-04-07 22:02:43 Someone has to promote the oil industry’s agenda.

4024 2018-04-07 22:02:24 Gee Travis, and now we do the same thing with oil pipelines, routing them away from white neighborhoods through more poor neighborhoods and native peoples reservations.

4031 2018-04-07 22:01:08 He's always been a wonderful man. Unlike Hillary, he's always put the people first. Never banks, big pharm, white water, big oil and gas. The reason they are starting this Bernie bashing early is due to their fear. What they should fear is four more years of trump, that's coming.
4032 2018-04-07 22:01:03 But we’re suing the oil companies. Such political courage that must take.

4039 2018-04-07 22:00:02 yesterday when I was sleeping my mom picked up my car, took it to get new tires and an oil change, and dropped it back off to me with a full tank....what did I ever do to deserve this woman 
4040 2018-04-07 21:59:57 At that age, if I didn't like the sleeping arrangements, I'd foot the bill for my own room.

4043 2018-04-07 21:59:34 Must have been at least a thousand fans there in the grandstands today! I wonder how much Liberty Media paid Mercedes for the oil leak and not to press the party button this weekend!
4044 2018-04-07 21:59:31 Dad’s are awesome  My Dad was one the scientists that helped to discover the Prudoe Bay Oil field..He was an expert on Upper and Lower Triassic Dinoflagellates..He was a founding member of the International Society of Stratigraphic Palynologists ..Avoir un jour beni 
4045 2018-04-07 21:59:26 When out, I just take a couple tablespoons coconut oil, mix in some egg white protein powder and some salted almond or macadamia nut butter ~ sometimes adding a tsp unsweetened dark cocoa powder, then put it in a little screw-top container to eat with a spoon
4046 2018-04-07 21:59:21 The same people who make their scrambled eggs with oil.  
4047 2018-04-07 21:59:20 I would assume murder. He’s probably pissed off many of the wrong people over the years with his snake oil salesman tactics.

4049 2018-04-07 21:58:54 Cannabis oil works for pooches as well
4050 2018-04-07 21:58:54 The sugarsnap peas were cooked in garlic, cayenne pepper, salt, and a dash of sesame oil

And the steak had garlic, salt, paprika, cooked it with some onions
4051 2018-04-07 21:58:46 “and thats the olive oil *sip*”
4052 2018-04-07 21:58:21 Ms. Sanders, then why won't @realDonaldTrump call Putin out publically on it? If your boss is so tough on #russia, why not sanction their oil business? Until he calls out the dictator and it's their oil business. Your's and his tweets are just empty, meaningless words.
4053 2018-04-07 21:58:20 Your boy really needs to get his life together cause I got a homework assignment that I haven't started because I've taken too many naps and I'm considering doing my oil change before all of my homework since that needs done to
4054 2018-04-07 21:58:16 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

4059 2018-04-07 21:57:38 Napoleon in Egypt 1798 “God is great and Muhammad is his prophet.” "To Muslim ears, this sounded like the 'shahada'." 1973 Oil Crisis accelerated agreements kowtowing to Arabs who would not sell oil to countries supporting Israel. Choices were made.

4063 2018-04-07 21:57:17 Listening to Lauren and Charlie talk about kids is to much I’m in tears over the fact Lauren is talking about blending the baby’s food and Charlie’s is like ‘Yeah blend a cheese burger and add some oil’ . @_LaurenSkerritt
4064 2018-04-07 21:57:05 Peppermint oil spilled all over my purse, so now everything smells Listerine-y. Laundry time.
4065 2018-04-07 21:57:05 It’s that paranoia when you’re head of a protection agency that’s not protecting anything but big oil and corporate polluters. The cabinet is evil, and they know it.
4066 2018-04-07 21:57:01 99 percent of war is about money or oil not fighting evil in this world. Nationalism is used time and time again to get the public to back foreign wars, but people are waking up. Look how the public have reacted to the skripal affair, with skepticism
4067 2018-04-07 21:56:42 Destabilize Muslim countries destabilize Palestine where Muslims Christians and Jews lived peacefully for years, stop anyone questioning Israel by claiming antisemitism make people fear the only protector Russia and boom what have you got?

4079 2018-04-07 21:54:31 Grow a Brain! West taxpayers money goes to propping up an illegal racist apartheid occupation in violation of numerous UN res.

4084 2018-04-07 21:53:46 The oligarchy would never survive a "free market". Losing oil subsidies and aid to the Israeli genocide/arms trade is what keeps them up at night.

4086 2018-04-07 21:53:36 So in order to stay in #Syria the #US is shuffling #ISIS around in Helos to different areas. As long as there are pockets of ISIS remaining the US can maintain their excuse to occupy 1/3 of Syria where the oil is.  One goal is to keep Syria cash starved. No oil no money!
4087 2018-04-07 21:53:28 Man I hate it so much, just think of how much cash we all spend each yr on oil, I reckon 1 yrs worth would pay for a full renewable energy set up then all that cash stays here, we’re so being scammed, any polli against renewables is getting payed off by the Arabs, end of story
4088 2018-04-07 21:53:13 Snake oil salesman. I get seriously worrying, cult leader vibes off that guy.
4089 2018-04-07 21:53:08 I stopped giving his self promotional brand of snake oil tactics any credence years ago. Helping others to achieve a sense of self improvement is one thing, helping himself to feel a sense of self aggrandizement is something totally different.

4091 2018-04-07 21:52:52 No not seriously. Just making a point on personal preference and all that's at play. If you are a Federalist or believe in Provincialism, oil sector or renewable energy. No disrespect intended.

4102 2018-04-07 21:51:03 Really? These are people who think sending the National Guard to the border will solve the “problem” of illegal immigration & that we should just “take the oil” in the Middle East.

4110 2018-04-07 21:48:57 %agree. Once the oil runs out their hold becomes useless. Why do you think Israel the nation is drawing out the peace process. It's waiting till the west is finished kowtowing for oil

4115 2018-04-07 21:46:47 the guy who changes my oil said, “have a nice run” and I replied, “you too.” So now I’m looking for a new place to get my oil changed.
4116 2018-04-07 21:46:39 the first place you run and tax is the poor and okla does not have a middle class! instead of oil comp and gas comp. you feel you need to charge tax on cigarettes and gasoline for the working poor! can not wait till you're gone

4125 2018-04-07 21:45:26 Outrageously cynical view of the lives of the people in those communities likely to be affected by said oil spills!

4127 2018-04-07 21:45:18 You can have it easily. Regular running 2-3 times/week 45min not too fast (breathing easily) it's about making your butt & legs working, not your heart. Cooking with little oil. Stop Coca , even light or zero, stop biscuits, chocolate bars. Have veget every meal. Result 2 month

4131 2018-04-07 21:44:10 I’ve never thought very highly of him. Self help “gurus” are snake oil peddlers but this is beyond the pale.
4132 2018-04-07 21:44:10 There was always a blue can of manteca in my grandmother’s kitchen. Everything was cooked or fried in manteca. You should try white rice made with manteca instead of butter or vegetable oil. It’s amazing.
4133 2018-04-07 21:43:37 My skin is so bad at the moment and I feel so crap I have a set routine with a foam cleanser and a stress control scrub and an oil free moisturiser but nothing is working

4136 2018-04-07 21:43:31 Not aware of any BC products going through Alberta that would require billions more than any insurance will cover to cleanup if spilled. Existing pipeline was mostly built with the intention of importing more refined oil from AB for BC use but ended up shutting BC refineries.

4141 2018-04-07 21:42:51 Pretty soon they will cut open my stomach and find nothing but jigsaw puzzle pieces and engine oil. Wow, they will say, that sure explains a lot.

4153 2018-04-07 21:41:14 Pruitt received major corporate and employee campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry.  Why is he the head of the EPA again??  Why are the Koch Brothers, his fellow oil buddies, protecting him again??? #GOP
4154 2018-04-07 21:40:59 No. Real men from Delta swimming in proper oil money are not razz. They are the definition of tushed up. My delta brothers are not razz
4155 2018-04-07 21:40:59 Spent my morning at the barn, got a free oil change on my car, spent my afternoon by the pool and now I’m getting ready to go out with my sister and Mom plus we rented a convertible as a surprise for my mom’s birthday 

I truly am living my best life

4165 2018-04-07 21:40:01 Tony Robbins is a snake oil profiteer akin to an Evangelical pastor. Subway may be hiring soon T, you should call Scott.
4166 2018-04-07 21:39:57 This is all made up by modern atheists to avoid the logical fallacy of the non existence of god or deity. English Lang provides a single word answer to belief on existence yes(theist) no(atheist) don’t know(agnostic). Dawkins sells intellectual snake oil.

4177 2018-04-07 21:38:49 Try to pretty it up all you like.  Its a blight on the landscape.  The stuff is not oil until you add toxic chemicals to the tar and send it to specialized refineries outside of Canada to process.  Shame on you for pretending otherwise.

They changed oil w/o asking got home oil wasn’t reaching dipstick. Added 2 quarts still not reaching dipstick
4182 2018-04-07 21:38:23 Anyone who has experienced an oil spill near their home will tell you it is horrendous and costs mega bucks to clean up. Your tax paying dollars , plus local volunteers spending weeks, months helping save local wild life.

4184 2018-04-07 21:37:58 @TonyRobbins I always took you for a snake oil salesman.  Now, I take you for an arrogant, out-of-touch with reality chauvinist also.  I never have, never will waste my money on you or the total bunk you shovel.
4185 2018-04-07 21:37:28 I love your store! I got the Rosy Cheeks mask, a Hot Oil Treatment bar and a sample of the vinegar-y based hair mask. If only I had a bath tub, I'd buy all of your bath bombs! <3

4187 2018-04-07 21:37:22 I wanna try to egg, mayo, and olive oil treatment my hair but I would have to get someone to do it for me bc I can’t bend over to do it myself
4188 2018-04-07 21:37:15 The amount of times the last two days that I’ve mentioned olive oil being used my the ancient romans for butt sex is simultaneously too damn high and not high enough
4189 2018-04-07 21:37:12 In fairness to Pep though,  he did take an above average Man City team and bolster it with a few hundred million pound of oil money and still managed to win the league on the second try.

4196 2018-04-07 21:36:05 In other words, every kind of baffoon & snake oil salesman east of the Mississippi + Calnifornication people. Sure wouldn't want to miss that !!!
4197 2018-04-07 21:36:02 Or sometimes fake followers, or 'negotiated links', or robot testimonials, or meatbots from the third world to pad your views. Not always used for snake oil, but I would argue that 'Magic Sauce' is a fitting name for the flavour of success arising from the illusion of results.
4198 2018-04-07 21:35:41 & spending tax-$ on putrid PO pictures of the narcissistic Liar in Chief & -oil salesman, Pence is NOT a bill U.S. Citizens should have 2 pay.

4199 2018-04-07 21:35:36 The right has been winning economically in the U.S & Britain since the 80s.

4202 2018-04-07 21:35:13 The demand-side impact of a trade war isn't that China stops buying US oil, it is that trade and GDP suffer globally, hitting industrial expansion and consumer spending, and therefore oil demand.

4215 2018-04-07 21:32:59 cooking discoveries:
1. coconut & avacado oil (in place of olive oil) is a healthy option, but it makes cooking strange. it gets hot V quickly, but scorches the outside of the food while the inside is still raw. beware.
4216 2018-04-07 21:32:58 Ya fair enough, let’s hope the Oilers can do the same or start the pot at $200k or something
4217 2018-04-07 21:32:49 thank your good genes, we need more of those

4241 2018-04-07 21:29:10 An excellent analysis of known information, but until we know the strategies and mindset behind their visit, I am reluctant to draw conclusions. The fact that GOP was reluctant to support their endeavor, and the oft cited Texans and their oil rants, carry minimum weight with me.
4242 2018-04-07 21:29:06 He has to bring the coconut oil tho
4243 2018-04-07 21:28:55 No - I know cc very well! My question is very simple - how do you calculate the fair value of a cc so you can tell people 0.08 is a very attractive price to enter. Btw - the consensus for oil price in 1 year is not 30-100 usd! The range is far more tight
4244 2018-04-07 21:28:54 As it looks, the Ducks not only knocked the Oil out of the playoffs last season, but there was a ripple effect this season as well.

4247 2018-04-07 21:28:35 Be sure and steam your vegetables and bake meats. If you want to fry use extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil.
4248 2018-04-07 21:28:11 rub it with cooking oil and put it upside down in the oven on max (no, really maximum) for half an hour to an hour with a baking tray to catch drips. Then make sure when you clean it after subsequent uses you don’t use soap/detergent, just scrub it + dry with kitchen paper.

4261 2018-04-07 21:25:56 Allllllll summer 2018! I’ve got the baby oil ready 
4262 2018-04-07 21:25:54 Because he is corrupt just like you and your oil company cronies.
4263 2018-04-07 21:25:52 That was a true Manchester derby. Doesn't matter who owns the club's tonight. Whether billionaire oil franchises or our own Glazer's leeching mob. It had passion, fire, class and left everyone drained and on their knees. #mancmade #mufc #mcfc
4264 2018-04-07 21:25:39 Manchin is a slimy, two faced liar. He 'talks out of both sides of his mouth.' He is a 'snake oil' salesman who is only interested in himself, and secondarily his immediate family.
4265 2018-04-07 21:25:32 I wouldn’t have gotten through middle school without that Pink oil mosturizer.
4266 2018-04-07 21:25:25 my grandma talking to the oil that pops when she cooks is so funny and cute
4267 2018-04-07 21:25:10 You people are wicked poo
4268 2018-04-07 21:25:00 Somebody bring me some real pain meds or some cbd oil
4269 2018-04-07 21:24:58 Maybe she meant Bush' Tax Cuts,  somebody should double check--  "OIL MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE  aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh"
4270 2018-04-07 21:24:55 I know I should take lower temp dabs in general, but I don't doubt that the heavy hash oil use is more of a contributor than the pot
4271 2018-04-07 21:24:49 Then thing with invented conspiracies is they aren’t connected to much of anything.
No need to be an expert to debunk (except in snake oil salesmanship) no need for copious counter evidence: the conspiracy has only tiny touch points to reality.
4272 2018-04-07 21:24:46 Investment fleeing the country. Energy East cancelled as tankers bring in foreign oil.  Northern Gateway cancelled,the pipeline that made the most sense, LNG plants being cancelled as we pipe natural gas to US and they sell it to world with 30% markup
4273 2018-04-07 21:24:41 If man united aint winning the league then why you so obsessed about man united losing against the oil club
4274 2018-04-07 21:24:34 It's in preparation for the Oil Sheikh 
4275 2018-04-07 21:24:34 Word must change , oil must not trade using dollar ,USA arogancy will end.
4276 2018-04-07 21:24:24 The oil is also heavy so use it lightly lol
4277 2018-04-07 21:24:23 And Popeye was another favorite. Although today, with all this over sensitive and judgemental society have become, people would say that Popeye, because of his arms, was on steroids, Olive oil was anorexic, and Wimpy with all his love of Hamburgers, was leaning towards gay. LOL
4278 2018-04-07 21:24:21 Do you think BC should take responsibility for any products that passed through their coast through Alberta? We already presently deliver oil to BC Through a pipe line which we have been doing for over 50 years
4279 2018-04-07 21:24:12 Just watched All the Money in the world and I’m so slow. It just clicked the Getty family behind the oil are the same ones behind Getty images

4282 2018-04-07 21:23:24 Best oil ever!!!
4283 2018-04-07 21:22:58 He’s no life coach. He’s a POS and sells snake oil, just like megachurch “pastors.”
4284 2018-04-07 21:22:48 @BakkenShale oil from coal 41% more reserves . plant be built Ashland Kentucky by oil and coal companies , money maker for both . refinery is there  pipe line is there . PRESIDENT will support it

4286 2018-04-07 21:22:39 I quit smoking cigarettes 2 yrs ago but continued to smoke pot. My lungs cleared up pretty good but then I added vaping a lot of cannabis oil on top of it and it was almost like I was a smoker again, always coughing up shit. I've cut back considerably.

Especially all that liquid toxicity its spewing right alongside the freeway. Also a trip to Loveland just to see all the fracking and oil extraction going on in rout. Alarming
4290 2018-04-07 21:22:28 The same Tony Bruno that talks about once being heard worldwide. And now discusses slathering up dudes in coconut oil and pleasuring them.
4291 2018-04-07 21:22:27 It’s British oil not Scottish oil, any way oil is on the way out with the advent of electric vehicles so dream on
4292 2018-04-07 21:22:18 You add Apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil?
4293 2018-04-07 21:21:30

4294 2018-04-07 21:21:17 I feel for the citizens who have been betrayed as #NWO & #UniParty terrorise the planet. How could oil & money be worth more than your nation and your own people

4298 2018-04-07 21:20:33 I miss my mannnnn I kinda hate that he works in the oil field... well only the traveling part.
4299 2018-04-07 21:20:06 RT @LivingSafely: Haven't changed your vehicle's oil since December? Why not make an appointment at the garage today!

4306 2018-04-07 21:18:28 @TonyRobbins is a hack snake oil salesman who co-opted NLP as his own revelation to success. He made lots of money off of low witted suckers. But he's still just a cheap hack.

4329 2018-04-07 21:15:33 It's funny how when man city win games, haters complain that city spend a lot and only winning because of oil money, HOWEVER, when city lose, those exact same fans ramble on about how money can't win you titles/games! 
4330 2018-04-07 21:15:33 Are you stuck in the oil patch Zig Ziggy, most likely with stranded assets.

4332 2018-04-07 21:15:23 They ignore it because @EPAScottPruitt is removing all the regulations that were in place for their buddies in the oil and gas industries; that will allow them to drill on public lands and on the coasts that were previously protected ... among other things  #QuidProQuo

4336 2018-04-07 21:14:31 This is an old song and dance excuse.  Most of you young people have never lived under FAIR Trade. Nixon sold us off to China. Sanctions on the Oil Producing States with the help of China are in revolt. Tried of us bullying everyone with the Petrol Dollar. Tariffs are nothing
4337 2018-04-07 21:14:20 Been consistently using coconut oil for about 3 weeks and got some of my natural color back. Is that possible ? I was pasty white for a min cause of this PNW weather, now I look like I’ve tanned.
4338 2018-04-07 21:14:10 Came to #Walmart for car oil service, 3 hours later a crew of 8  only worked in 2 cars, #walmart low price every day!
4339 2018-04-07 21:13:59 I’m the same way. I try not to take pills if I can avoid it. The peppermint oil has worked great. It doesn’t take a lot and I just rub a bit on my temples. Hopefully it works for you too!
4340 2018-04-07 21:13:38 So the king stole the land from Native Americans.  Then when the king decided the work if settling was too hard, he decided 2 steal some people 2 come & do the stuff that They couldn't or wouldn't do.  Follows the same logic of Trump telling folks the USA shouldn't taken the oil.
4341 2018-04-07 21:13:24 There's no conspiracy against Pruitt at all. Pruitt is a corrupt crook fleecing the taxpayer. On the contrary, this fake drive to protect him is more likely funded by his Coal, Gas and Oil paymasters.

4351 2018-04-07 21:11:54 PROTIP: Buy sardines in olive oil.  Drain the oil into your partially-used olive oil bottles to make them last longer.  Spend less on olive oil!
4352 2018-04-07 21:11:54 Yeah, I'm not saying it's worse than its opposite, I'm just wary of anything that amounts to painting oil drills pink for breast cancer. (Which is actually a thing that happened.)
4353 2018-04-07 21:11:44 Car dealership: "So, we know you only came in for an oil change...but it turns out your tires are worn, your throttle is dirty, you need new breaks, and your car is just a huge piece of shit...thanks for stopping by!"

4355 2018-04-07 21:11:21 You miss the point--will be catastrophic if China, Japan & others don't buy USA debt--plus China & many others are leaving the Petrodollar & buying oil with other means--all totaled are major problems for USA

4358 2018-04-07 21:11:05 I don't like a lot of the policies changes @JustinTrudeau has made. But his support for the km pipeline is quite logical. Far safer transport the oil by pipe than by truck. #protecttheinlet #cdnpoli #kindermorgan

4372 2018-04-07 21:09:27 Of course it is! Of course it did! And it will again and it will happen in Nebraska and damage the aquafir in the process. 
But keep believing the corporate narative that oil spills don't happen. What a joke!
4373 2018-04-07 21:09:22 Nice
4374 2018-04-07 21:09:21 Umm. All the major Alberta oil CO’s stood beside Notley when they announced the AB carbon pricing plan. Further, seeing a 40% discount cause oil is landlocked and KM over subscribed. They would make that $1 back easy.
4375 2018-04-07 21:09:20 Isn't it great that the conservative and right wing people have no problem with their children breathing foul air and having our water ways covered with spilled oil and dumping of waste into our drinking water, thanks to Pruitt
4376 2018-04-07 21:09:15 Yes, this is an absolute scandal - especially as the cannabis oil enables Alfie to have a near normal life - with far less pain & only one seizure in several weeks (as opposed to many seizures EVERY night.) #basketcasebritain #politicalcorrectness - compassionate conservatives ?!

4379 2018-04-07 21:08:33 Anywayyyy I got put on to moringa oil, it just came in the mail and imma be a delicious gawdess all spring/summer 2018
4380 2018-04-07 21:08:30 I visited an antique shop in Oklahoma City today - not one sign or oil can. How is that possible? 
4381 2018-04-07 21:08:19 I used to like her but she appears to care more about BLM than fighting offshore oil drilling off our coast. She is not fit to represent our state. Note I said APPEARS. She doesn’t GAF about BLM issues in CA or any local issues She’s using us as a steppingstone to the White House
4382 2018-04-07 21:08:15 They are potatoes. The ice water draws the starch out. You pat them dry and fry them in canola or sunflower oil. Super crisp, super delicious. Sprinkle with fluer de sel.
4383 2018-04-07 21:07:52 It's like how public transit is the smart choice for *ssssoooo* many reasons, but we can't properly answer the question of Why Not? without confronting the auto, oil & other industries who depend on maintaining the status quo.
4384 2018-04-07 21:07:52 @MR VISE PRESIDENT we can produce 41% more oil by oil extraction from coal plant  coal and oil comp. want this together ready to fund it  Ashland Kentucky boundries OHIO,W.V. KY.  over 500 000 new jobs need your support
4385 2018-04-07 21:07:46 Exports up by 10% last year and exceeded 11bn. What hit the trade balance is the high oil import bill on account of higher prices and higher imports due to more thermal power generation during drought
4386 2018-04-07 21:07:43 Yes...that would be incredible ..
4387 2018-04-07 21:07:26 My car is 16 months old and I've never changed the windshield wipers. I should consider doing that, she said after going to her oil change a month late.
4388 2018-04-07 21:07:17 Govt controls Oil (Petrol and Diesel) as per it's own benefits..
4389 2018-04-07 21:07:02 Who got the oil cartridges????

4391 2018-04-07 21:06:42 The evidence, dear Donald, points otherwise.  However, evidence and the Trump administration are like oil and water.
4392 2018-04-07 21:06:41 I should make John take my car and get an oil change  but it’s gone come back smelling like weed
4393 2018-04-07 21:06:22 Peppermint oil
4394 2018-04-07 21:05:57 Do you have to like, work out to have a body like that or can o get that drinking beer and shooting things?
4395 2018-04-07 21:05:50 We have nothing but deficit spending, which used to be called writing bad checks, and an endless war cause New York was demolished. The last thing we need is a trade war. What happens when oil gets priced in Euros not dollars?
4396 2018-04-07 21:05:41 If your pooch needs pampering, the best place has arrived on the beach. Beachside Dog Spa only uses the best, natural, essential oil based products. And they treat your furry friends like the prince & princesses that they are. So happy you are here!
4397 2018-04-07 21:05:34 I thought that snake oil salesman's 15 minutes was up half an hour ago!  Who still listens to that rubbish?
4398 2018-04-07 21:05:23 So all my cookware is cast iron and it's all basically nonstick and the secret is this: you need to cook a steak with it. Put it on high (I mean high) heat for 3 full minutes to preheat. Apply thin layer of oil to the steak and salt&pepper. When pan is smoking hot add steak 1/
4399 2018-04-07 21:05:18 @antoniodelotero oh yes I can agree! I'm also happy with the results but I hope it can still get a bit better. What did you use for your scars? I'm trying to use vitamin e oil and apricot oil and  rosewater but still cant get all these scars away

4401 2018-04-07 21:04:35 Jesus you ppl are still engaging in a debate that died before breakfast? LIG it bruh you have your mindset and we have ours take it with some castor oil and chill out
4402 2018-04-07 21:04:33 y’all so obsessed with having mixed babies but can’t even do your basic white hair, i know you can’t put in work with pink oil & eco styler
4403 2018-04-07 21:04:31 Nowhere. Got my oil changed at Mr lube last time. They over tightened the screws on my engine cover plate. Now, I cant get my oil changed and need to take my car to the dealership to replace the whole thing. Tried to contact the store, no one is answering. This is very upsetting.
4404 2018-04-07 21:04:16 He said journalists.
4405 2018-04-07 21:04:04 Classy. Proud to be an Oilers fan.
4406 2018-04-07 21:04:01 Now if they could just listen to me about the draft...
4407 2018-04-07 21:03:53 Finally getting an oil change that I needed weeks ago smh 
4408 2018-04-07 21:03:52 Nope. Oil and gas.
4409 2018-04-07 21:03:50 Hey who wants to come sit with me on an oil platform and snap a bunch of laptops for the rest of our lives
4410 2018-04-07 21:03:41 Hey you know what to! so well see how it goes!! Btw nice idea the magnet to fish our the metal part in the oil tank
4411 2018-04-07 21:03:21 Well Done #Oilers
4412 2018-04-07 21:03:16 Haha I couldn’t learn the patterns of cleric beast, so I literally threw oil urns and Molotov’s at it before finishing it off!
4413 2018-04-07 21:03:13 I don’t understand waiting for Rihanna to drop her body oil to start advertising yours lol.
4414 2018-04-07 21:03:09 “Anyway brother, here’s some tanning oil.”
4415 2018-04-07 21:03:04 Oh ok.  Believe what you want. But DT did it more than Obama. He has hit Putin where it hurts in his pocket book. He’s stopped his the money flow both through oil increases, and banking sanctions.  But keep up the narrative it seems to be working
4416 2018-04-07 21:03:01  she needs sponge to really absorb that oil....she looks like a prayer warrior tonight!
4417 2018-04-07 21:03:00 wow i got red palm oil all over my powder blue sheets 
4418 2018-04-07 21:02:57 Thanks for your C60 updates!!
We just made a 1 liter Sunflower Oil batch using 1 gram of the BuckyLabs OvenDried 99.95% pure Fullerines.
  Mixed for 1 week in our VitaMix at lowest speed and had very little residue..
  Now mixing a 1 liter batch using Avocado Oil
4419 2018-04-07 21:02:57 that leaves palm oil, current global production is around 48 million -- is there the capacity to increase production enough to replace the 33 million tonnes of dairy fat?  ie an additional 33 million tonnes of palm oil?  theoretically, yes (ref to follow) /3
4420 2018-04-07 21:02:54 So proud this is happening! Great decision 
4421 2018-04-07 21:02:50 You must own a coal or oil company!
4422 2018-04-07 21:02:37 1A and 2A are very similar in that yes, you can exercise it, but you are not obsolved of the consequences of your actions.
4423 2018-04-07 21:02:31 Thank you Oilers Foundation. You are always a class act. Heartfelt condolences to @HumboldtBroncos and families.
4424 2018-04-07 21:02:27 Put oil in to complete it.
4425 2018-04-07 21:02:22 Ended up using cooking oil cause that Vaseline wasn't doing the trick. They did grow back. But never again shall I ever wear individual eye lashes never
4426 2018-04-07 21:02:19 Seriously? You think our economy is the one benefiting from Texas oil company #kindermorgan transporting foreign owned oil from foreign owned oilsands to foreign owned refineries for foreign buyers? If you cared about foreign influence, you wouldn’t support this project.
4427 2018-04-07 21:02:01 Thank You for listening!!!!

4430 2018-04-07 21:01:54 My favourite moment of today is when I slipped on a bit of oil as I was walking past a stranger, I maintained eye contact with them as my legs descended into a split like stance.

10/10 
4431 2018-04-07 21:01:49 That’s gonna dent his snake oil sales
4432 2018-04-07 21:01:41 And matched plus more by Katz I would hope.... 50/50 money isn’t even from their own pockets
4433 2018-04-07 21:01:39 Owner: hello, Insurance Co ? My restaurant has just been hit by an oil tanker.
Insurance Co: Your business has been hit by a tanker truck coming off the road...
Owner: 40,000 ton tanker. Not a truck. A mother f@#king ship. 
Insurance Co: We’ll need to send a claim assessor...
4434 2018-04-07 21:01:38 where are people buying that face oil that u put under makeup that makes ur skin look glowing I see that shit in every insta vid
4435 2018-04-07 21:01:23 If going by second amendment, you'd prob only be allowed  a Muskets and Flintlock pistols, since we're not fighting the British, and not likely to go to war with US Troops the 2nd Am is as outdated as Whale oil lamps, A hunting gun is a far different thing than a military weapon.
4436 2018-04-07 21:01:22 Not really, I'm a tad anal so have whipped fairings off, checked and. Double checked everything, lubed adjusted, oil filer etc, more than you'd pay for at a garage
4437 2018-04-07 21:01:22 If I had to pick 5 right now, it would probably be 1. Hall, 2. MacKinnon, 3. Giroux, 4. McDavid, 5. Kopitar...bottom three could change in order and Wheeler is right there as well.
4438 2018-04-07 21:01:12 @NateInVegas they heard you
4439 2018-04-07 21:01:10 now look at sources of plant based natural fats (not industrial oils), global prodn of fat (in million tonnes) is: olive oil 3.3; coconut oil 3.4;   almonds 0.64; cashews 0.33; hazelnuts 0.39; pistachios 0.30.  Even if cld double production, still only replace half dairy fat /2
4440 2018-04-07 21:01:09 Please send this guy back to Oklahoma were he will feel safe among the Earth Quakes his oil buddies are creating - sad
4441 2018-04-07 21:00:55 The west needs a change of their strategy towards the rest of the world ! Maybe invest in green energy then they won’t need to go to war to control the oil ! But I guess money talks ! We all are fooled by the propaganda too easily one evil usually comes from another evil
4442 2018-04-07 21:00:53 I smell like bacon and lavender essential oil... could be worse
4443 2018-04-07 21:00:50 Not true.  This is about Oil.  I am very grateful to read other publications than listen to this lie.  Syria is not giving up their country.  Turks and Russia are in Syria. We get out of the way.  Clean it up. France has showed up.  Time to come home. Trump stop funding ISIS
4444 2018-04-07 21:00:36 Driving Safety: Haven't changed your vehicle's oil since December? Why not make an appointment at the garage today!
4445 2018-04-07 21:00:33 Greasy Pruitt is so drenched in dirty oil and oozing swampy chemical waste from every orifice that the biggest danger he faces could be Spontaneous Combustion!    
4446 2018-04-07 21:00:32 วงวารน้อง ขอบคุณที่ช่วยดูแลน้องนะคะ
4447 2018-04-07 21:00:20 Awesome. Good job!
4448 2018-04-07 21:00:20 April 07, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4449 2018-04-07 21:00:16 Most City fans did once the oil money came in..most are ex Man U fans..that's a fact, seen it with my own eyes on here. People admitting they switched.
4450 2018-04-07 21:00:15 Most you gone do is burn the pot a little with the cheese lol you got it. If you’re adding meat start that first, also adding a bit of oil and butter to your cheese will save it from burning fast. Don’t worry
4451 2018-04-07 21:00:12 Oil is used to make countless products.
4452 2018-04-07 21:00:08 been taking 25-50mg CBD oil each day for a couple weeks and i've noticed a significant improvement in my anxiety, back pain, quality of sleep and overall mood. no psychoactive effects, so i take it each morning before work/gym. i highly recommend it! 
4453 2018-04-07 20:59:52 Good stuff boys
4454 2018-04-07 20:59:44 Thank you 
4455 2018-04-07 20:59:34 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
4456 2018-04-07 20:59:06 I appreciate that @BarackObama was trying to get the US up to speed with renewable energy. We subsidize gas & oil & we should spend whatever it takes to get away from oil dependency & into the 21st century.
4457 2018-04-07 20:59:03 Going to see a record single game amount tonight.
4458 2018-04-07 20:58:59 Argan oil shampoo got my hair feeling so soft 
4459 2018-04-07 20:58:51 Jamaican castor oil > everything.
4460 2018-04-07 20:58:38  @ThirdEyeBlind “How do you do it, roots in the soil untangled 
Releasing in sweet summer oil still I recoil like mace 
In all the little moments I pushed you away that I can't erase
Cause every moment overflows with power 66 thousand miles an hour” 
4461 2018-04-07 20:58:26 This so called empowering movement is about deception, misogyny and victim blaming. Snake oil salesmen for the psychologically vulnerable. Shocking!
4462 2018-04-07 20:58:24 As well , unlike consumables, lithium is infinitely recyclable and valuable so the total amount of active lithium will always grow. Unlike oil which will only shrink
4463 2018-04-07 20:58:21 Coconut oil isn't all that.
4464 2018-04-07 20:58:19 Is there a way to buy online as I will not be at the game?
4465 2018-04-07 20:58:14 Exxon the same Exxon that has been trying for years to get Russian sanctions removed so they could go there and start raking in more money from the oil lake
4466 2018-04-07 20:58:11 all of my white shirts have been ruined by oil paint someone help me out
4467 2018-04-07 20:58:06 I know them well ...suffered last 3mth coz of alleged unpaid HMRC landfill tax ...covered in IC this week ...they do nuclear and oil and gas waste
4468 2018-04-07 20:57:53 And, I understand according to the @CookPoliticalReport voters aren't buying your garbage. Keep selling your snake oil and being honored to serve with that thing you elected "president."
4469 2018-04-07 20:57:46 Well done 
4470 2018-04-07 20:57:42 Who would’ve known working in the oil field will have you traveling around US. Y’all better bet I’ll be visiting NJ & NY while Im up in PA 
4471 2018-04-07 20:57:19 Argan oil is awesome!
4472 2018-04-07 20:57:09 Man has been removing crude oil from our home, Earth, for one hundred years or more.   What long term affect, Ethan, on our home?  In other words, what replaces the space.  Do you think that eventually something may cave in?
4473 2018-04-07 20:56:59 Please RT this until it reaches a chemist! Is it ok to handle my iron sample? Will that corrode it more quickly, or will the oil protect it? Also... This thing is standard metal colored (silver grey), but my iron skillet it is solid black. What's up with that?
4474 2018-04-07 20:56:55 Trying to think today has felt like trying to do fifty in second gear, is this what life is like for dumb people? i got cod liver oil and ginko, finally, so i might be a full-speed idiot by the time i wake up
4475 2018-04-07 20:56:39 Tune your harp

Ultimate catastrophe and mayhem

4476 2018-04-07 20:56:33 homegirl is scubbiny feet with cuticle oil??
4477 2018-04-07 20:56:26 I guess it depends on the issues. In this day and in this culture for politics for instance ... ppl who make noise affect the change they want to see in the world. So make lots of noise! The squeaky wheel gets the oil 
4478 2018-04-07 20:56:20 @TonyRobbins acts like a predator in this clip. He has no respect for victim's boundries. 
He is a snake selling his snake oil.
4479 2018-04-07 20:56:20 I’m not trying to be THAT bitch but Coconut oil is the nastiest shit you can put on your face STAY AWAY FROM ME SATAN
4480 2018-04-07 20:56:15 First dose of CBD (cannabis oil) today and for the first time in years no pain in my back and legs. Having tried everything else this was a last ditch attempt to be pain free. But very expensive. NHS need to put this on prescription.
4481 2018-04-07 20:56:13 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
4482 2018-04-07 20:56:11 Indeed.
I just get frustrated by people that buy into "optics"
They're ASKING to be sold snake oil.
4483 2018-04-07 20:56:08 Yep.
4484 2018-04-07 20:55:56 Of course it is but that Flyers team has more than a few quality players on it. Regardless of whether or not the Avs win tonight, MacKinnon should be in the Top 3.

4490 2018-04-07 20:55:33 A HELPING HAND, then a Samaritan traveling down the road came to where the hurt man was. When he saw the man, he felt very sorry for him. The Samaritan went to him, poured olive oil and wine on his wounds, and bandaged them. (Luke 10:33-34).
4491 2018-04-07 20:55:24 Buying me and my homegirl some @KaylarWill body oil for our trip to Mexico.... 
4492 2018-04-07 20:55:22 OMG, oil pulling is promoted for anything and everything up to and including "remineralizing your teeth" and curing cancer. 
4493 2018-04-07 20:55:17 Today is World Health Day.
Just thinking about Universal Health Coverage(UHC=
We have spent Trillions subsidizing oil products, billions for security. Yet we budget less than 5% for health & similar for education.
Isn't this insanity? Misplaced priorities...
4494 2018-04-07 20:54:55 I don’t have a problem with investing in other energy, I do have a problem with shutting down Canada’s oil industry,Canada cash cow ,at the same time as tankers bring oil from other nations.
4495 2018-04-07 20:54:51 What is a good oil diffuser?
4496 2018-04-07 20:54:51 Today's failure by Rep Rosenthal to qualify for the ballot is proof positive that Coloradans are weary of "progressives" who criminalize homelessness & "environmentalists" who side with oil & gas. If you claim these mantles, your actions must match your words. #coleg #copolitics
4497 2018-04-07 20:54:46 Net proceeds from tonight's @EdmontonOilers 50/50 will go to support the victims & families affected by the @HumboldtBroncos tragedy.
4498 2018-04-07 20:54:46 Tony Robbins is a snake oil salesmen preying on the weak minded, which is why he is anti-women standing up and thinking for themselves
4499 2018-04-07 20:54:28 Fun fact: Ted Cruz has never used cooking oil. He just scrapes his palms on the pan.
4500 2018-04-07 20:54:03 Oh ok. Have you tried a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil or oil cleansing?  
They're supposed to work better than astringents that strip away your natural oils - forcing your skin to produce more...

4503 2018-04-07 20:53:05 100 pts is impressive and we don’t know if MacKinnon is eligible yet
4504 2018-04-07 20:52:51 Mads really took my car to get an oil change while I’m at work. That’s really my bff y’all 
4505 2018-04-07 20:52:40 Two things about vaping. You are not exposed to tobacco and it’s health effects but you are exposed to nicotine and its health effects. Nicotine is not a benign chemical. Vaping places are selling CBD oil, so beware of that.@smerconish @CNNPolitics
4506 2018-04-07 20:52:35 This has nothing to do with tariffs.  Let's be honest.  Sanctioning countries who are Oil Producing States.  China is going for the Petrol Yuen. They have had enough with our bullying.  20 Trillion in debt.  We signed on for another 1.3 Trillion. Even Trump stated once. Bubble
4507 2018-04-07 20:52:27 Just gave it a 350 degree bake with some oil, now trying step 2! thanks for this advice.

4509 2018-04-07 20:52:13 Nominated for sure but would vote for both Hall and MacKinnon before Giroux.
4510 2018-04-07 20:52:04 What makes me sad seeing all those people paying money to that snake oil salesman so he can get even more wealthy. It reminds me of the religious Tele scammers who syphon money from poor people as well.
4511 2018-04-07 20:51:59 It can also be used as motor oil and paint thinner.
4512 2018-04-07 20:51:54 WTF I just saw a tv commercial for chainsaw oil. Ahhh, Spring has sprung in Minnesota. What about wood chipper oil lol? Sooo #Fargo

4515 2018-04-07 20:51:39 And lashings of olive oil IIRC?
4516 2018-04-07 20:51:36 One answer, Hemp Oil.
4517 2018-04-07 20:51:32 The oil filter removal requires one of the suspension wishbones to be removed...rear suspension and driveshaft and hub assembly..Pity they didnt try something normal like a dry sump....ah a V8...the 4 cylinder version was just half the engine literally
4518 2018-04-07 20:51:30 (blinks)

Chef, could we get a little more oil? Yes, it's let go of my phone, but it's sort of... well, adhered to a different surface here, to whit, Co-Cap'n Chip.

4520 2018-04-07 20:51:18 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
4521 2018-04-07 20:51:18 1/2 You are conflating unit of account with currency unit. Oil is consumable: gold is immutable & exchangeable. Gold has an (energy equivalent) oil cost to produce: oil does not have a gold cost because no gold is used in its production
4522 2018-04-07 20:51:15 To buy my smokers club ticket or get a tune up and an oil change? 
4523 2018-04-07 20:51:10 If the western governments stop waging wars to steal their oil and support regimes that oppress their people then the western world wouldn’t have so many refugees .
These people are running for their life’s for a reason
4524 2018-04-07 20:51:09 Swimsuit. Coverup. Sunscreen and solar cane is really all you need. I would hold on the tanning oil until day 3. Not a good idea to start with it.  
4525 2018-04-07 20:50:58 Getting rubbed down & massged with baby oil
4526 2018-04-07 20:50:52 Okay but Black castor oil saved my life
4527 2018-04-07 20:50:50 You said "after they got their oil money" (2009) so indirectly I was offended 
4528 2018-04-07 20:50:41 Snake oil salesman. All of them: self help/business Gurus, mega church pastors, politicians.
4529 2018-04-07 20:50:28 You’re amazing thank you so much I’ll do that  and will let you know what happens   My pain meds aren’t working and just started CBD oil so not sure if it will help did a 6 week program of nerve blockers 4 neck and back that didn’t work I’ll try anything at this point tks so much

4531 2018-04-07 20:49:49 In Cleveland, a spark flew from a train into a river that had oil covered debris, which set the river aflame. Although the fire lasted about 30 minutes, cleaning the river took years #burningriver #ees028
4532 2018-04-07 20:49:20 Oil change, New tires, rotated, balanced and aligned, and a Bar wash. My shit is Brackin rn.
4533 2018-04-07 20:49:20 Oil change paid for just gotta get my lazy ass up 
4534 2018-04-07 20:49:18 And the only fans City have supported other teams Pre UAE oil money
4535 2018-04-07 20:49:10 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
4536 2018-04-07 20:49:07 Sometimes people we know and trust also trust snake oil salesmen.
4537 2018-04-07 20:49:04 Oil will always be needed but the future growth in both jobs and energy is in Renewable Energy

If we fall behind in these leading edge technologies Canada will become far less competitive and lose
far more jobs in the long run

Demand for oil is growing worldwide
But #NoPlanetB

4542 2018-04-07 20:48:02 Quiero compartir con todos ustedes la experienza de mi padre como un humilde persona que salio de margarita a buscar un futuro a su flia y comenzo a trabajar el la shell oil company y trabajo 44 años de su vida dandole a este pais sus mejores años
4543 2018-04-07 20:47:58 Don't use soap to clean it. If the pan is hot, deglaze it with wine or a bit of water and let it cool a bit. Plastic scouring pads, coarse salt and water are all you need. Do not let it air dry--either use a towel or heat it on the stove to dry it, then coat it with a bit of oil.
4544 2018-04-07 20:47:52 For him? You bet it was.

All talk and no action.

Go peddle your snake oil somewhere else
4545 2018-04-07 20:47:51 i need to find the oil warmers
4546 2018-04-07 20:47:37 If vegan no butter. If not then butter n coconut oil.... Give a good shake ooooo smooths it right up lol .

4551 2018-04-07 20:46:58 Season by baking a THIN (wipe away with a towel enough that you really can’t see it) coat of oil above its smoke point ~30 min. You’ll need multiple. Wash w/ soap is fine, but never soak, make sure it’s DRY, and maintain by heating a quick inside coat on the stovetop b4 storage.
4552 2018-04-07 20:46:57 U ever spend $30 + tax on olive oil
4553 2018-04-07 20:46:53 That looks like a S3 Esprit soooo engine out to change the plugs, belts, in fact almost everything requires the engine out apart from an oil change and thats epic to do introduce you to a new game find the oil filter and remove it.... Mate had one...not good.
4554 2018-04-07 20:46:51 My home made chicken nuggets were better than that with the sunflower oil I think.
4555 2018-04-07 20:46:33 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to tolerate the conditions of these fields.
4556 2018-04-07 20:46:28 U can go for ur masters program there now
4557 2018-04-07 20:46:28 Oklahoma Gas & Oil Companies, YOU got tax breaks so YOU can take that $ and REINVEST it back into Oklahoma’s communities. If you want tax breaks, this is YOUR duty GREEDY Jerks! Your day will come. #Teachers #OklahomaTeachersWalkout #Education
4558 2018-04-07 20:46:15 Coarse salt (like kosher), a little water or oil, and a scrub brush. Heat a bit and then scrub the daylights out of it. Rinse (literally) and repeat as needed. You’ll want to reseason it before using again. Has worked on everything we’ve thrown at ours.
4559 2018-04-07 20:46:11 He’s a snake oil salesman and carnival barker. He fits into the mold of any successful con artist. Total fraud based on confirmation bias.
4560 2018-04-07 20:46:05 #EarthToParis: we’re addicted to oil and we need to get off ASAP

Shell to Seattle: hold my oil rig…
4561 2018-04-07 20:45:38 Also:
1) Put the pan on the stove, give it a thin coat of oil, heat it up until just before it starts smoking
2) Let cool. Wipe away any excess oil with a paper towel.
3) Repeat.
4) Do steps 1 & 2 prior to cooking each time, for a bit, just to build up a nice season
4562 2018-04-07 20:45:37 Got an oil change and a car wash/detail now my car smells like a piña colada 
4563 2018-04-07 20:45:16 Now playing: Pro-Pain / Operation Blood for Oil
4564 2018-04-07 20:44:52 Why is this not okay, but all Trump's oil money is ok with you? Biased much?
4565 2018-04-07 20:44:47 I have seen it. I actually spent a little time there last year.I know it exists and I know why were here.I simply reject your reality and substitute it with my own. I welcome your thoughts, so gather your d'forces and let's have fellowship. No I've never tasted raccoon oil, ik.
4566 2018-04-07 20:44:43 Cleaned my room up a bit, got new oil, all I need now is some fish tacos and I can chill
4567 2018-04-07 20:44:27 1. The GOP Tax plan 2. Taking away healthcare ie Medicaid for our most vulnerable citizens 3. EPA deregulation 4. Trying to brand the presidential seal and make money on plates at his golf course in Florida 5. Trying to set up offshore oil rigs 6. This trade war with China

4569 2018-04-07 20:44:20 @MikeHudema The last ship to leak oil in Vancouver Harbour was carrying grain. Should we shut down the Prairies too?

4571 2018-04-07 20:44:10 Arggggggg!
If I   Haven’t mentioned it lately...... I HATE LA traffic
Took over 90 min to get to the Valley this morning. Oil spill on the 405 and they closed it. That was aggravating enough. 
Now it’s almost  2 hrs getting  back to the West side !  Seriously LA ? 
4572 2018-04-07 20:43:55 PRUITT shouldn’t be Chief of the EPA.  He is protecting MINING, CHEMICAL, and OIL COMPANIES and their agendas.  He doesn’t care about the ENVIRONMENT or the ANIMALS  that live there. REGULATIONS are put in place to REGULATE  SELFISH, GREEDY people like PRUITT.
4573 2018-04-07 20:43:47 @sharonijreport1 @tvcnewsng  Some people are very callous! #SeaWolf Oil Company aka #AmCon Management! how do you sleep every night!.The Bible and The Koran said you should pay wages to workers, for what they worked for. #LabourLens
4574 2018-04-07 20:43:47 Old head giving me game on oil changes though...
4575 2018-04-07 20:43:40 Haven't tried the oil. How/where do you use it? #TUSKEGEE_RYS18
4576 2018-04-07 20:43:29 Got this stuff called sugar wax sauce and it’s probably the most fruitiest / potent smelling oil I’ve had.

4579 2018-04-07 20:43:16 TEA TREE OIL WORKS
4580 2018-04-07 20:43:10 it always makes me laugh when I read "don't take cbd oil with alcohol" pretty sure cannabis and alcohol have been taken together for centuries lol. guess it's just basic medical advice, plus alcohol has no medicinal benefits so
4581 2018-04-07 20:43:09 Yes, and the US gets nothing useful from Canada, unless you want to count insignificant things like oil, cheap hydro electric power, and, of course, fresh water.
4582 2018-04-07 20:43:09 coconut oil me please
4583 2018-04-07 20:42:58 Spend some time properly seasoning it now. 
1) Give it a good scrub
2) apply a thin coat of a neutral vegetable oil
3) place a cookie sheet on the bottom rack of the oven
4) place the pan, upside down, on the upper rack and bake at 325 degrees F for 30 min
4584 2018-04-07 20:42:18 South Of Heaven by Jim Thompson - complex plot, but mostly a primer on Texas Oil Fields in the 1920s by someone who was there.
4585 2018-04-07 20:42:16 That’s right. China, the US and the EU are stronger economically and the transfer to non-fossil fuels weaken the Russian oil on the world market. What else do they have? Certainly no Silicon Valley...
4586 2018-04-07 20:41:38 the reality is that it doesn't matter what government is in  power, its the oil and gas companies that make the decisions in this country. as evidenced by the @bcndp Gov. decision to proceed with our Site C and give huge tax credits for LNG. both elxn issues that could oust them
4587 2018-04-07 20:41:11 Well the donors from both parties don't let that happen. Look into all the oil spilled by buffet alone.

4590 2018-04-07 20:40:24 All plastics are oil all pesticides are oil all pharmaceuticals are oil based,  it takes 26 litres of oil (energy) to make a tyre,... can powdered metal replace oil in those circumstances. Oil isnt just about fuel / energy

4595 2018-04-07 20:39:46 I had no oil in car and didn’t realize it  thank God for my Dad 
4596 2018-04-07 20:39:44 Unsurprised to learn that @TonyRobbins is not just a charlatan & a snake oil salesman but also a regressive misogynist who doesn’t call out illegal sex discrimination when it’s in his face.
4597 2018-04-07 20:39:31 it’s sad that people are so obtuse that they blind themselves from the fact that he’s getting paid by coal and oil companies to deny the inevitable destruction of our planet. for mONEY

4600 2018-04-07 20:38:56 am i the only one obsessed with the smell of coconut oil?
4601 2018-04-07 20:38:56 Nope the governor is a failure.  She has drove the state into the ground.  She is controlled by big oil.
4602 2018-04-07 20:38:47 Oh the Garlic infused Olive Oil just tipped that meal into being too rich #FirstWorldProblems
4603 2018-04-07 20:38:46 Ive just read your replies to others in this thread asking the same question and I agree with them all. The coconut oil one was interesting to me, Ive never gotten on with it, I felt it clogged my skin like you said. and cetaphil I've never actually tried, but I feel like..

4606 2018-04-07 20:38:30 Not too long ago they went and fought, killed and were killed for oil companies, not too far away from they will do the same for websites; Facebook and YouTube.
4607 2018-04-07 20:38:26 The NRA, much like big pharma or the oil industry, is one of many purveyors of corruption in out political system.

And besides, the only reason states don’t have to share their information is because of a lawsuit that the NRA filed.
4608 2018-04-07 20:38:22 from what I understand, having a bit of mineral oil on hand is good for that.
4609 2018-04-07 20:38:06 Oil change hurry up!
4610 2018-04-07 20:38:02 Started typing an email but remembered I have a huge tax bill and heating oil bill both due this month and totally can't afford to be frivolous right now. Hopefully next time, 'cause these both look brilliant :)
4611 2018-04-07 20:37:48 ...warm water is a great way of cleansing your skin!if you wear makeup and need that extra cleanse rub coconut generously on your face and rinse with warm water.

4612 2018-04-07 20:37:45 Yep. He’s set us up for the future where has Oil will eventually run out. Man City need to start setting up for the future apart from buying every young player on the market that seems half decent. That’s why I still think in 5/6 years we will be like the Man UtD with S Alex Fer

4618 2018-04-07 20:36:09 A strange question, especially since this topic has been thoroughly explored over many previous posts.
4619 2018-04-07 20:36:04 Big day: got a haircut, got an oil change, bought a well used box set of 'Lord of the Rings' books at Goodwill, helped clean my mother-in-law's house after fixing her wifi router issue. I honestly can't imagine what my wife has in store for me next.
4620 2018-04-07 20:36:00 The Crown Prince's visit is to reform the kingdom and create a future so great and prosper and not solely reliant on oil. 
2030 Vision is all about diversifying income sources and create a better life for the citizens, and as clear as what's before us, The vision is happening!
4621 2018-04-07 20:35:59 And quit the dumb "war for oil" meme. That hasn't made sense since the 80ies. There's plenty of inexpensive oil in the US today.
4622 2018-04-07 20:35:58 And if you follow oil you also know there have been up and downs in production and consumption which explain why price range went up and down! Tell me why a certain cc shall be .1 or 10 or 100?
4623 2018-04-07 20:35:46 Are you sure about that? I came across a rosemary olive oil bread that I thought was  pretty snobby.
4624 2018-04-07 20:35:45 Sadly, Oklahoma government cares more about tax breaks for oil and gas industry so they can line their own pockets with money. They send all their kids to private school, so why should they care about public schools??

4629 2018-04-07 20:35:16 A simple search.

4649 2018-04-07 20:32:29 Ok tell me about beard oil... 
4650 2018-04-07 20:32:12 Very true. The oil leak off Louisiana is still costing $10+ billions yearly but lives destroyed, incomes and taxes lost gone forever. Alberta must sign a Lloyd's "Names" type of security in favor of BC for current risks attending transport of oil.

International law (which we've done our best to degrade)
Free flow of oil (which, I am pretty certain, is not just our concern).

HR, rule of law, are things we advocate for.  They are not interests.

4657 2018-04-07 20:31:06 Oil price was down and up several time. What was a reason of it ? Only speculation. Same is at CC.
4658 2018-04-07 20:30:55 I think we should show hydro we arent willing to pay any more And the govt should regulate fuel prices The oil boys are having a good laugh The price of a barrel is down about half of what it was a couple years ago and here we are paying more than then Whats wrong w this picture
4659 2018-04-07 20:30:45 But to elaborate it's like pick one acid and go. Pick one oil and go. Pick one barrier and go. Done. No matter what the skin type
4660 2018-04-07 20:30:42 I think we've all been sold out for oil. Great.
4661 2018-04-07 20:30:29 Wait ... Can’t tell if that’s a typo or a good joke...
4662 2018-04-07 20:30:23 rrrrrrrghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 

(gasps)

well the tongs are definitely not working; Chef, can you bring us a shot glass full of olive oil?
4663 2018-04-07 20:30:14 It’s all about proper seasoning! Season and oil it properly and it will become basically non-stick over time, which means an easy clean.
4664 2018-04-07 20:30:01 I think its for seasoning. If they start basting people with olive oil they might be cannibals, not protesters.
4665 2018-04-07 20:29:56 Ms. Phillips...i am reading today that your good friend@DanWoy in this picture has lobbied against Alberta's Oil Industry....can you please confirm the accuracy of this story?

4668 2018-04-07 20:29:49 yeah, I wanted to try landscapes, which I've never tried before. And wanted to do oil because my aunt (@sheepincognito) is an oil pro.
4669 2018-04-07 20:29:48 Could possibly something to do with ham-fisted amateurs like me spilling oil on the hot parts. Smells great though so I don't mind.

4671 2018-04-07 20:29:40 *squints* maybe we should try olive oil?

4673 2018-04-07 20:29:13 Did the slime pay you Mark? I wonder how many bankruptcies he had tallied back then. @realDonaldTrump is still a snake oil salesman. The difference of course is that now he’s hurting all Americans except those in the top 1%, and he’s using the presidency to make money.

4693 2018-04-07 20:25:20 Simple H. They still believe the rUK suck all the oil revenue when it made less than 60 million last year. It’s not worth billions like it use to. They’re on like a corbyn free bus. We offer free stuff the vote for us

4695 2018-04-07 20:25:05 I just changed my oil on the Mustang for the 1st time. It feel so fulfilling. It’s cake ass work too. Would’ve cost me $70+, I paid $30 for my oil and filter at AutoZone. I caught the oil change package on sale.
4696 2018-04-07 20:25:01 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
4697 2018-04-07 20:24:59 Which is why I've said let the coast cecede. The red counties own the water, farming, oil, manufacturing (what's left), and sensible people.
4698 2018-04-07 20:24:55 @KerstinFlorian it was so much easier to use Rehydrating Neroli Oil before u changed packaging. Now it's messy, requires two hands, go back to the blue bottle with NO DROPPER!
4699 2018-04-07 20:24:42 @OIL º Fue venta en 65,45. El petróleo acaba la semana bajando sin atisbo de duda. Le pesa mucho el techo que ha construido en los 66$ del que se comentó en su día.

4702 2018-04-07 20:24:03 IMO recreating film for the aesthetic of memory is a valid aesthetic choice, in the same way that nobody lives in black and white and yet it's a valid way to evoke period/the past, or recreating the look and feel of an oil painting, or using bleach bypass technqiues
4703 2018-04-07 20:23:54 Glad you didn’t spill the oil.
4704 2018-04-07 20:23:50 I think South Australians will be horrified2think that a big multinational company like BP thinks only thing good4them is [to be] out there with some buckets and some mops cleaning up an oil slick . Parasite greed & their funded Govts pollute manipulate mislead =No Democracy?
4705 2018-04-07 20:23:37 Alberta and The federal treasury benefit from the oil. BC is exposed to incalculable risks of destruction of marine environments, tourist spending, population displacement, huge and sudden increases in health and welfare costs. How greed warps judgement!
4706 2018-04-07 20:23:32 puberty and castor oil  LOL
4707 2018-04-07 20:23:23 well tells me one thing for sure then ... those who keep saying that the origin of North Sea Oil is uncertain are pretty fucking thick dimwits! 
4708 2018-04-07 20:23:21 Try to explain your answer is just an excuse ! For oil you have good estimates about supply and consumption - you can very well calculate a fair price. For stocks you have good indications about future profits. What is your reason to say a CC is cheap?
4709 2018-04-07 20:23:20 Who come rub Ceece olive oil na? Shining forehead #bbnaija
4710 2018-04-07 20:23:12 See that I can believe. The two destroyers running into oil tankers, ffs. Someone was mucking with the radars.

4713 2018-04-07 20:22:56 Lac Mégantic is an example of an oil fire in a densely populated area. Trains don’t travel over oceans to Asia and that’s what the Westridge extension is really all about...and we have plenty examples in 2018 of how unsafe that’s been in the world!

4725 2018-04-07 20:21:39 Just tried my hand at oil painting for the second time and it was awful and I am terrible. Despite watching hours upon hours of tutorials over the past few weeks.

4728 2018-04-07 20:21:20 Sanchez engaged w/ ump (Gibson) at the end of an inning about being told to speed things up at the start of an inning & it became somewhat animated. To his credit, Gibson didn't overreact & toss him.

4732 2018-04-07 20:20:50 You're so right. Steady rise since Trump's policies are enacted. Scott Pruitt and Rick Perry are in bed with the gas and oil producers. Drill baby drill, but prices to consumer keep going up. 
4733 2018-04-07 20:20:31 IS THE NEW OIL.
4734 2018-04-07 20:20:27 I use Deva Curl sis! I use it to wash my hair & i use their hair mask treatment every now and then. But for styling I just put coconut oil in it and let it dry on it’s own! Deva curl thoughhh get wit it! 
4735 2018-04-07 20:20:27 Poisoning our air and water to line the pockets of oil and coal executives is dangerous business

4755 2018-04-07 20:17:48 Prolong fracking caused sinkholes. It disintegrates the ground where they are doing it making the ground instable. If oil company s are doing it on your property
 .its tresspassing not to mention making it wortlless

4772 2018-04-07 20:15:01 I didn't see the Sanchez thing (I'm geoblocked from so much coverage in Europe; hard to see highlights even when I find them with shitty wifi). Yes, the umps are making it worse. Many times the players are walking away when they say something; let them go
4773 2018-04-07 20:14:25 Ingredients:
100% coconut oil
2 eggs
Extra virgin oil
Directions:
Add your eggs, 4 TBS of oil into a bowl and mix till smooth.Apply to your scalp and hair and massage for 5 mins then put plastic wrap on then wait 1 hour then rinse it out.

4782 2018-04-07 20:13:27 I wish people knew how to take care of nice cars, tune up, get that oil changed, vacuum it out, wash it up 
4783 2018-04-07 20:13:22 And to be fair, many of those aggressive situations are based on umps engaging and escalating. Was fully expecting Sanchez to get tossed the other night. It really is a terrible look.

4820 2018-04-07 20:09:38 He always comes out as a snake oil salesman without any substance in his affirmation laden self help discourse.
4821 2018-04-07 20:09:37 Sorry guy. When you denigrate a politician as exceptionally accomplished as Clinton, you're just making a fool of yourself. Especially when you worship Bernie the snake oil salesman. I ask again: Did Jane find their taxes yet?
4822 2018-04-07 20:09:30 Agree completely. Umps are so bad. Throw out the aggressive but a bat flip or even a few words, let it go. Sheesh.
4823 2018-04-07 20:09:17 So you winning the league for 3rd time makes Manchester blue lol come back when you’ve won 21 under your own steam not money from oil remember you was bankrupt running the club on your fan base #boughtfora£
4824 2018-04-07 20:09:16 For lamps too. But yes, oil.

One story just highlights how irresponsible early scientists were. An expedition in 1886 looking for them took samples (i.e. killed) of 42 seals.

In four days.

4833 2018-04-07 20:08:03 Getting an oil change for Isaac. I was given snacks. I guess they must think I'm a little girl. Lol.
4834 2018-04-07 20:07:51 This what snake oil salesmen do.
4835 2018-04-07 20:07:49 Yes!! I used an olive oil spray for the foil to stop them sticking, but if you used a silicone baking mat they probably wouldn't stick anyway. I just mashed up 1/2 tin until it was very mushy and put it in the icing piping syringe, so easy to do! Bake 50 mins low temperature

4848 2018-04-07 20:05:53 This wasnt a suprise to Russia/Iran/Syria they knew the west were building bases on the outter proximity of oil fields and would allow other NATO countries to loot syrian resources as well and further occupy soverign land

4862 2018-04-07 20:03:54 @PantsOnFire45 No need for hate but we do need to call out the BS every time over & over to combat all their lying! GOP has been lying to us for decades! Because the work for oil industry & not the American People!
4863 2018-04-07 20:03:49 People who want a puppet to roll back environmental regulations so they can make even more oil money, that’s who @ScottPruittOK
4864 2018-04-07 20:03:46 I try to avoid all those people selling their philosophy on anything. They all look alike and think alike and it's just complete made up bullshit. You do these five things exactly like I tell you and you'll be a billionaire next week. Like me. sighs. snake oil con artists.

4872 2018-04-07 20:02:58 @FairQuestions Vivian Krause is next.  Do we really need to spend $280,000 to determine why Canada's oil and gas industries are falling behind?
4873 2018-04-07 20:02:52 I didn't even want to ask! 
4874 2018-04-07 20:02:52 His vote to kill local control of dangerous oil and gas industrial operations hurt him too.
4875 2018-04-07 20:02:46 People sign up for National Guard to help defend their country; not to do oil changes on Border Patrol vehicles as part of a useless BS publicity stunt.
4876 2018-04-07 20:02:27 It’s for labor. Most of the things you can buy cheaper and do yourself for your car, like windshield wipers and air filters, but it can be tedious to change your oil yourself. I usually just prolong mine with top offs I do at home.
4877 2018-04-07 20:02:13 At the mall while my car gets an oil change and snow tires removed. Need to get new regular tires, which is unwelcome but not unexpected. Ankle is still a little twitchy.

4886 2018-04-07 20:00:58 Potion of growth or giant size I loved. Oil of sharpness was great for fighter. Enchanted pendant that was a one time absorb elements made by our Druid @CastleMacRaven
4887 2018-04-07 20:00:36 Ironic that you invoke Venezuela as an example of failure - they got into trouble in part by basing their economy solely on extraction of oil. The CA economy is much more diverse and it shows. Try again Tucker.
4888 2018-04-07 20:00:20 So what you suggest? We should consume fish oil or not?
4889 2018-04-07 20:00:16 Some say his pee is bottled by a major oil company.
4890 2018-04-07 20:00:09 The benefits of fish oil are included in this product. The amounts of EPA and DHA fatty acids are included at a very high amount. It is distilled molecularly providing for a pure and high-quality product. Don't miss this opportunity.
4891 2018-04-07 19:59:58 Truth makes you laugh then installing an oil gas man to run the EPA fox guarding the henhouse is the saying of course republicans have no wisdom
4892 2018-04-07 19:59:54 yes! Or 150 could cover our electric bill + water/waste management bill (we don't have a separate heating bill, no oil here)

4894 2018-04-07 19:59:52 Grapefruit seed oil is also a wonderful treatment for gums/teeth. It's a antifungal. Many sinus & oral issues are actually fungal & therefore don't respond to antibiotics. There are quite a few natural anti fungal products online & at whole food stores.
4895 2018-04-07 19:59:38 I love everything distilled, like my water, liquor, oil
4896 2018-04-07 19:59:37 Helos are bullshit, you're essentially driving a flying oil leak. Rotary aircraft crashes happen so often, there's nothing really new to it. The more experimental, the more risky.

4904 2018-04-07 19:58:18 But a lake of sauce on noodles?!  God forbid!  To my mind, some great virgin olive oil, a hint of garlic and some red pepper flakes and a sprinkle of Italian parsley tossed with fresh fettuccine cooked al dente sounds divine to me. Maybe it’s the Pinot Grigio talking!
4905 2018-04-07 19:57:55 I’m in shock. They really said hummus is just mashing chickpeas together and only sometimes adding oil.
4906 2018-04-07 19:57:55 Damn. Just doing Nuln Oil on Cawl has taken an hour...
4907 2018-04-07 19:57:51 The live supply demand feed is the issue — do you want you utility to have the ability to micromanage your consumption? There is a downside to that (central planning). Yes ROE would have to go up to meet costs. At $10k per transformer that’s a lot of ROE.
4908 2018-04-07 19:57:47 The rail companies have been greedily shipping oil and ignoring wheat but now farmers’ frustrations are the employees’ fault, sez here.

“What the fuck?” 
“Out of lube!” He rummaged in the cabinet. “Ah ha! That will do the trick!” He walked past them, tossing a bottle of olive oil in his hands. 
“Olive oil? Are you serious?” 
 “It’s organic.”

4945 2018-04-07 19:51:29 Alright Marlene. She has been 'identified' with the sinner in Luke 7: 36-50 who washed his hair with oil. Whether that 'sinner' was Magdalene or not, Jesus forgave her. So our Lord DID, in fact, forgive a harlot.

4960 2018-04-07 19:49:31 8/9. Only a small oil.
4961 2018-04-07 19:49:31 Oil production in Canada is at record high levels. 

Not sure what is urgent about it. 

What's urgent is the time to action on climate breakdown.
4962 2018-04-07 19:49:18 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
4963 2018-04-07 19:49:13 No worries dude. I was very impressed. I was also thinking of the parf system but it didn’t suit what I wanted. Having to oil bit it freaked me out. Made my own and use a zobo but but was messy
4964 2018-04-07 19:49:03 i wanted to give the oil a chance too
4965 2018-04-07 19:48:53 Just clean it up. Oil is thick, it’s not like water. Scoop it up and move on.  MAGA
4966 2018-04-07 19:48:53 What’s your point? We are still the 3rd lowest in the nation. The GPT is just a small portion of the tax cuts that is given to the oil and gas companies. We can fund education if the spineless legislature would roll back half of these cuts.
4967 2018-04-07 19:48:52 Hot fucking oil just popped into my eye and I’m about to have a damn breakdown
4968 2018-04-07 19:48:49 Lobbyists like, big oil? Haliburton? Central banks? OH! You probably meant one spacific lobbyist. Like the NRA. They are the worlds big bad wolf here. Oooops!
4969 2018-04-07 19:48:37 Yet another con artist making money off snake oil.
4970 2018-04-07 19:48:25 Pink Oil. Super grow.

4973 2018-04-07 19:47:09 Try a different oil but they help me sometimes
4974 2018-04-07 19:47:08 maybe use peppermint oil to repel them?
4975 2018-04-07 19:47:06 Or maybe some oil and gas people? He's quite cozy with them.
4976 2018-04-07 19:47:06 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
4977 2018-04-07 19:46:53 Putin is an authoritarian conservative and so I dislike him, However, His Eurasian Economic Union is growing by over 2%, Iran are planning to join soon,  he is allies with China. China are trading oil in yuan as opposed to the petrodollar and so the US dollar is tanking...
4978 2018-04-07 19:46:53 Manchester City are certainly a fantastic test case for oil's usefulness in creating plastics. I wonder if scientists are looking into this.

4983 2018-04-07 19:46:13 the article seem to center around the premise that we all live in urban areas. those of us in rural areas need larger and 4wd for hauling farm supplies, etc, or driving off road just on own properties. progs thinking they know what is best for everyone. as usual.

5000 2018-04-07 19:44:05 Robbins is just a modern-day snake oil salesman...a bullshit artist. Always was, always will be.
5001 2018-04-07 19:43:50 I’m not shocked by anything Tony Robbins said or did in that video. I’m only surprised that this poster boy for snake oil salesmen still manages to draw a crowd in this day and age.
5002 2018-04-07 19:43:48 So glad this is the last oil change I’ll have to pay for in this car.
5003 2018-04-07 19:43:41 A few empty seats won’t hurt us as after all we are based off oil money

5005 2018-04-07 19:43:26 Modern day snake oil salesmen who don't even have the decency to give you at least a little alcohol for your money.
5006 2018-04-07 19:43:18 Then those power beans with veg oil.o dun baje.
5007 2018-04-07 19:43:17 You'd be peasants without the oil money, so pipe down as you x
5008 2018-04-07 19:43:17 also the baby is not allowed to leave the bedroom under any circumstances because the tile is too cold for her feet. and before her daily dairy bath, i have to massage baby’s entire body with olive oil for 20 minutes
5009 2018-04-07 19:43:12 Snake oil salesman sir.
5010 2018-04-07 19:43:10 ISIS wouldn't come back if YOU would not fund them  Tell MOSSAD to lay off  Golan Heights belongs to SYRIA, not ISRAEL. Tell GENIE OIL to get OUT

5017 2018-04-07 19:42:02 Robbins is a snake oil salesman.  Here u tries to use his deep voice voice and large stature to bully this woman — and she didn’t back down. Good for her!
5018 2018-04-07 19:42:01 You are correct sir. But I feel Nigerians need to give this administration more time, as it is faced with all the negative forces fighting against her, amidst a global economic recession facing all oil dependant economies. But I feel a younger man will be suitable for the job.
5019 2018-04-07 19:41:42 
5020 2018-04-07 19:41:33 Now.  I'm telling you that @TonyRobbins is a snake oil salesman.  Raise your hand if you heard me.
5021 2018-04-07 19:41:31 It's funny how when man city win games, haters complain that city spend a lot and only winning because of oil money, HOWEVER, when city lose, those exact same fans ramble on about how money can't win you titles/games!

5023 2018-04-07 19:40:50 Baby really got me putting coconut oil on my tattoos
5024 2018-04-07 19:40:44 There's oil on the sun, I'm sure 

Trump should go check that out in person.
5025 2018-04-07 19:40:43 I heard a disgusting noise coming from my vehicle and took it to my mechanic. Breh this nigga said "jajajaja you was escared, es nooothing jes put de heavier oil"
5026 2018-04-07 19:40:42 But merguez are Tunisian/moroccan and I’m doing couscous, so I’m going with olive oil instead,  to respect the geography of the ingredients
5027 2018-04-07 19:40:41 I use brown sugar and olive oil, scrubs well. It will mold given enough time, just don't make too much.
5028 2018-04-07 19:40:28 Wow. He met over 50 times just with oil, gas, coal, and mining alone and 4 times with any environmental group.

5037 2018-04-07 19:39:34 Bit of advice ... 
I nearly made a mistake there using goose fat to start my tomato sauce. (We tend to go goose fat first, butter 2nd, rarely oil)
5038 2018-04-07 19:39:24 All these gurus are greedy phonies. All out to get rich by selling snake oil to the desperate.
5039 2018-04-07 19:39:20 Economic CO2 tax modelling based upon unrealistic assumptions of no capital flight? Given exodus of manufacturing jobs out of Ontario after implementation of Green Energy Act, & ongoing capital flight in oil & gas industry, Canada can't afford any more economic damage. #canpoli
5040 2018-04-07 19:39:19 What's going to replace oil.
5041 2018-04-07 19:39:18 So I'm getting my oil changed at Andy Shaw and there's a play house in the customer lounge. I'm alone in this room and I'm so tempted to go sit in it...

5049 2018-04-07 19:38:23 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
5050 2018-04-07 19:38:22 That's fantastic! 

I suspect that some people get poor results because they are using "oil cleaners" from beauty companies that have random extras or they are using the wrong oil(s).

Once you get on the right track, it can yield amazing results very quickly!
5051 2018-04-07 19:38:12 Lets go oil
5052 2018-04-07 19:38:06 No, we should beware of snake oil salesmen like you who put money and fame above the words and deeds of Christ. When YOU tell others to beware I say we need to support them. You only push the greed merchants. Shame.
5053 2018-04-07 19:37:47 No he doesn't. He'd lose the election if we held it tomorrow. He shut down pipelines and now is spending 300k to figure out why the ab oil industry is struggling...hes a dumb twit.

5059 2018-04-07 19:36:55 Fuck the groundhog...i know spring is close when my coconut oil is soft
5060 2018-04-07 19:36:54 Liberals just don’t understand economics? like the fact that solar is literally unlimited, win & waves also. Nuclear has some serious drawbacks, if you don’t believe me ask Japan. Should we leave US oil in the ground, in case we need to run our tanks ship& planes in a war?
5061 2018-04-07 19:36:51 at my work they sell a "protein" cookie it says VEGAN right on the package when I went to read the ingredients it says Palm Oil I was so frustrated 
5062 2018-04-07 19:36:49 Maybe if he stopped f**king the planet and kissing oil and coal's collective a**es he'd be more popular.

5105 2018-04-07 19:30:36 Turkey has been running with hare & hunting with hounds.On one hand it is impregnating EU with muslims,for future expansion of Ottoman empire & on other hand it is trying to upsurp as much oil rich territory in Syria & north Iraq to bolster it's finances.

5107 2018-04-07 19:30:22 Come on, Pruitt is nothing but an advocate for the oil and gas industry, with a remit to destroy environmental rules. Nothing should surprise us. Everything he does is to that end.
5108 2018-04-07 19:30:08 Considering the brutality of the Saudi regime they should be enemies but you know, oil and all that, makes it hard for morality to breathe.
5109 2018-04-07 19:29:52 @Bamabroker I’ve been doing some reading this weekend regarding oil, gold, dollar, yuan,  trade war, debt, treasuries, equities, tax reform, etc...and how it could all tie together. Rethinking my call for 1800’s spx in 2018. Still reading and hopefully learning.
5110 2018-04-07 19:29:51 Don’t be fooled by either side, It was a war to get republicans to increase the export tax on oil/gas. And yesterday democrats did all they could to prevent a tax on wind energy, They all have constituents. They’re all in bed with someone, and that someone isn’t the people.
5111 2018-04-07 19:29:50 Idk why @BMW is still servicing my car for and oil change and wheel alignment, seeing that I dropped it off since 8am. 
5112 2018-04-07 19:29:41 When you go t the car dealership expecting to pay $30 just for an oil change, but end up paying nearly $200 for extra shit! 
5113 2018-04-07 19:29:29 @realDonaldTrump Mister President ! Please stop buying Venezuelan oil! Vzla is a narco dictatorship. There is corruption, there are many political prisoners and many people dead, who protested against this government. There is hunger, there is a lack of medicines, it`s a mess!
5114 2018-04-07 19:29:24 Oil change & a full tank of gas best feeling ever 
5115 2018-04-07 19:29:16 Oil barons/cartels.
5116 2018-04-07 19:29:09 .@StephenLeicht told to keep @JPMOTORSPORTS55 crew posted when water and oil temps come up
5117 2018-04-07 19:29:03 Ya that would be great maybe the big oil guys would go out into space fight over that in the mean we regular people can take care of our problems at home get the Earth right with good water and food for all
5118 2018-04-07 19:29:00 Coconut oil on everything. Feels so good
5119 2018-04-07 19:28:48 Control the intensity of your oil cartridges, fuck around and end up fried all day lmfao
5120 2018-04-07 19:28:43 Oh yeah! I thought it was just oil leak
5121 2018-04-07 19:28:43 And Robbins is a snake oil salesman. Prays on weak people
5122 2018-04-07 19:28:34 I started cooking with olive oil instead of butter and in one week I've already lost the will to live.

5125 2018-04-07 19:28:29 Instinctively, one elegant hand weaved through his hair as the other proceeded to hold his calloused one, her head moving back to rest against his shoulder. The smell of peppermint oil wafting up to her nostrils as she inhaled his scent. "I am, not too sure how it'll turn out»
5126 2018-04-07 19:28:27 You got me! I wake up every day jealous I don't own the security company that brutalized Native Americans for oil $, can't have my own soundproof booth, can't rape education & the environment. Busted! Color me green with envy.
5127 2018-04-07 19:28:25 There is a lot of pseudoscience surrounding cannabis oil. A lot.

5131 2018-04-07 19:27:36 All of this war mongering against Iran is because they support Syria's and their own rights to self determination. Oh, and they have oil. Get your tongue out of the empire's ass
5132 2018-04-07 19:27:25 Snake oil salesman. Pyramid Scheme.
5133 2018-04-07 19:27:24 Ya 19 years ago .. u didnt have oil money.... thats why you were in sewers man... know the facts well before you speak...
5134 2018-04-07 19:27:12 We were here, where it didn't happen. You must have been getting your oil changed.
5135 2018-04-07 19:27:07 Hey @scheana, my husband needs some work done on his car... new belt, fluid wash, oil change etc. All I have is 7 mins so can you ask Rob if he’s available today to help me out? Thanks girl!! @PumpRules @Andy

5138 2018-04-07 19:26:29 Yeah that second kidney really set me back, but they insisted... The interest rate on the oil change was only like 50%, they said it was a steal. Couldn't pass up on that bargain

5144 2018-04-07 19:25:30 Nigeria is not fair to the oil producing communities.  It is a pity and very painful.
5145 2018-04-07 19:25:27 Why do we care what ‘self help gurus’ anyway. They’re just snake oil sellsmen to begin with
5146 2018-04-07 19:25:22 Pruitt could not care less about the mission of the EPA. His mission is to roll back regulations so coal and oil industries can make even more money. This is why Trump keeps him around even in the midst of all the corruption.
5147 2018-04-07 19:25:20 Okay but ocm is literally just oil and it works great and is even cheaper. Black women tend to have great skin and they don’t tend to use K-products. I feel like you’re being ethnocentric. Like it’s cool to enthuse. But Korean beauty products made me break out personally.
5148 2018-04-07 19:25:10 Nice to beat the oil rich franchise team on their borrowed home turf too !

5150 2018-04-07 19:24:55 You're right and Its fucked up. But the UN didn't allow any african country to go there. Because then the whole war Against gaddafi to get his oil would be useless

5156 2018-04-07 19:23:37 There we disagree. Gold is priced in oil as well. But we'll see the reality of it soon enough, I think

5161 2018-04-07 19:22:53 Oil money now
5162 2018-04-07 19:22:47 @TonyRobbins the has been snake oil sales man is trying to make himself relevant again by attacking #metoo 
5163 2018-04-07 19:22:44 With a bit of luck
Cross my fingers
Chuck some salt over the shoulder
None of the above work 
Try and get some fucker who knows about developing an oil field,some one with a plan
Not some twat who likes to give clues in code
5164 2018-04-07 19:22:37 OBVIOUSLT FAKE i can see THE OIL FILTER
5165 2018-04-07 19:22:33 Look up our attendance before “oil money”.
5166 2018-04-07 19:22:28 Pasta with prawns:
Cook some pasta

Finely chop garlic & chilli peppers, sauté in olive oil

Add a handful (for 2 people) of chopped parsley and grated Parmesan and a glug of olive oil

Mix into the pasta, season with freshly ground black pepper and serve
5167 2018-04-07 19:22:28 Til the oil runs out. Enjoy it, but don’t talk bollocks about empty seats. People in glass houses etc....
5168 2018-04-07 19:22:13 uyyy want ko ng takoyaki tsaka japanese siomai na maraming chili oil tsaka spicy chicken hays
5169 2018-04-07 19:22:13 It's funny who you mention. Putin used oil in russia and globalists don't like that, they also became more Christian I believe, again not liked. Duarte just came out and said he feared the deep state, and since the cia controls the drug trade it's obvious who he fears.
5170 2018-04-07 19:22:09 If sell side doesn't accept CNY bid, PBOC can adjust gold/oil ratio, at which point sell side can sell oil in USD, buy gold, ship gold to HK/Dubai/SGEI, sell gold, buy more CNY oil.  PBOC can use to gold/oil ratio to ensure it flows in CNY terms.
5171 2018-04-07 19:21:47 It neatly summarizes the differences. Oil lobbyists, gun manufacturers & war profiteers are worse patrons than, well...unions. "Big Teacher" is not my idea of a real bogeyman, despite Republican efforts to undermine public schools. The whole "balanced" thing is an obvious crock.
5172 2018-04-07 19:21:38 What people don't talk ab is how polluting it is making solar panels. Just like with rare earths. China gives no fuks ab its environment. But we are suppose to handicap our progress. Thank God TRUMP got us out of that Paris accord
5173 2018-04-07 19:21:12 Do you have any peppermint oil? It does help if applied lightly to the temples.
5174 2018-04-07 19:21:09 Trump is the most beholden.  Beholden to Putin, behold to The NRA, beholden to big oil...
5175 2018-04-07 19:21:06 We need more oil money......
5176 2018-04-07 19:21:03 I told a girl on yahoo answers to do that for her acne. All that oil in pb makes me laugh.
5177 2018-04-07 19:20:55 @OsmundsenTerje I just want to run an idea by you that you can accept or reject since I know nothing about engineering.  (I write books.) If plastic is made from oil, fuel can be made from plastic. Why not "drill for plastic," clean the ocean and create fuel at the same time?
5178 2018-04-07 19:20:53 やはり二次元は素晴らしい・・・
5179 2018-04-07 19:20:12 Getting my oil changed because I love spending money!!!!!
5180 2018-04-07 19:20:06 My daughter said that my sister have a con ordest book about how to get over on people could she be one of them USA and Taskeeque airman worker she is the on that's holding me back to took my inheritance to didn't give my oil check's
5181 2018-04-07 19:19:53 Love Rih, but I just found some liquid highlighter from Walmart by Wet n Wild. With a few drops of coconut oil, it's gon be lit.
5182 2018-04-07 19:19:47 Gosho: "I like the dogs' food--the coconut oil."  His English is coming along.
5183 2018-04-07 19:19:45 You gone just throw baby oil on a bitch back? now when y’all cuddle it sounds like Velcro when you get up
5184 2018-04-07 19:19:42 I'm waiting for an oil change and the guy next to me is eating a donut way louder than necessary. This is my hell.
5185 2018-04-07 19:19:42 The U.S. probably found oil in space 
5186 2018-04-07 19:19:39 I can drain car oil from my driveway now and pollute others water=hey gop way to go. I will look for homes/business and dump my garbage
5187 2018-04-07 19:19:38 You should be good with an entire oil rich nation's treasury to buy you every player you want 
5188 2018-04-07 19:19:36 Umm...isn't solar power a medieval technology?
5189 2018-04-07 19:19:34 People requiring an all meat diet are likely a statistically insignificant portion of the population. I never said that we didn’t need to deal with fossil fuels as well. If you read the article I posted the through line is we are converting oil to food instead of sunlight to food
5190 2018-04-07 19:19:30 In Juneau, John Lamborn speaks to mining in Alaska and its high standards and decades of studies that use science to develop the permitting process. HB199 will negatively impact everything in #Alaska from oil and gas to municipalities, and all Alaskans. #akleg
5191 2018-04-07 19:19:16 Their olive oil taste like engine oil
5192 2018-04-07 19:19:10 I did that, um the olive oil I mean, earlier. I will not be participating in Tennesseean folk medicine :D
5193 2018-04-07 19:19:10 i need that Fenty beauty oil fr
5194 2018-04-07 19:19:07 I mean, yeah, but if you’ve ever frequented r/skincareaddiction you’d see a lot of American women also use alternative beauty routines, too, like OCM. I’ve actually had a lot of success with it but I can’t use it when I have eyelash extensions due to oil breaking down everything
5195 2018-04-07 19:19:01 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
5196 2018-04-07 19:18:56 Godly priciples have no effect on our nation because there is no such thing as god. You're a snake oil salesman like your old man, peddling a non existent cure. You and your ilk should be ashamed of yourselves. #fuckyourfairytale
5197 2018-04-07 19:18:56 You realize how much oil you buy and hydro and you depend on Canada  for energy you have read a book or educate yourself so you don’t look like a fool 
5198 2018-04-07 19:18:45 And if there's a different ratio of gold/oil in CNY as there is in USD, then one could adjust that ratio to direct flows of oil, gold or both to where they want.  Ie the PBOC could pull oil away from the US...if it wanted.  It's simple arbitrage once the infrastructure's in place
5199 2018-04-07 19:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
5200 2018-04-07 19:18:38 @FoxNews #Russia @LindseyGrahamSC - I like SenTor Graham on foreign affairs. But cut off Russia oil sales? Roosevelt cut off oil to Japan and Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Maybe tread carefully?
5201 2018-04-07 19:18:31 @realDonaldTrump  Mister President ! Please stop buying Venezuelan oil! Vzla is a narco dictatorship. There is corruption, there are many political prisoners and many people asesinated, who protested against this government. There is hunger, lack of medicines, it`s a mess ! Help!
5202 2018-04-07 19:18:29 He reversed many regulations created to help protect the environment and curb climate change. He gutted the EPA offices. He is working with big oil to bring changes to EPA that benefit big energy, and not the environement. 

Is it any wonder he is hated so much?
5203 2018-04-07 19:18:28 If you don’t have really oily skin you should try bare minerals tint gel foundation, it’s water based so it’s really light on your skin! Also, the laura mercier oil free tinted moisturizer is legit so good!!! 
5204 2018-04-07 19:18:28 Crucial to everyone BUT China, who creates more pollution than any other country on Earth.
5205 2018-04-07 19:18:28 I’m at this little Mexican place getting my oil change and this man referred to his wife “la fiera”

5208 2018-04-07 19:17:57 Of course the sell side may not accept cheap China bids in which case $ oil price stays high & China must fall back on inventory while sell side inventory piles up (absent production cuts)
5209 2018-04-07 19:17:56 Note to self.... Never cook with oil without a sweater, gloves, facemask , a ten foot poll, and a riot shield.
5210 2018-04-07 19:17:52 I remember clean up crude oil off those shores in 1982!
5211 2018-04-07 19:17:46 coconut oil be having my skin feeling like butterrrrrrrr
5212 2018-04-07 19:17:36 We agree that exercise is great, but are very disappointed to see that INEOS are involved:  please look up Fracking online, to see what the effects are, of fracturing the earth to get gas and oil. This is what INEOS do, just to get resources to make more plastic we don't need,
5213 2018-04-07 19:17:33 How many were your green jobs Kathy ? Zero. Just think of the jobs this country could have if you weren’t anti oil.
5214 2018-04-07 19:17:26 If Big oil wants cheap RINS (they come free with every gallon of ethanol) just blend it! It is non-carcinogenic octane. At 10% (E10) it oxygenates fuel which reduces tailpipe emissions by 1/3!
EPA ok’s use of E15 in all 2001 and newer cars. Give RVP waiver for sale all year round
5215 2018-04-07 19:17:24 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
5216 2018-04-07 19:17:21 Hope Liverpool and spurs kick this shitty oil team in the next games and expose that bald fraud

5218 2018-04-07 19:17:16 The actors must've had oil that the Murican birds needed to liberate with their mighty power of freedom

5224 2018-04-07 19:16:41 It’s not the taking off part that is the struggle (I use 100% coconut oil anyway so it’s not harmful) it’s the  actual makeup itself. I physically feel soots developing as I’m wearing it. It’s horrid!
5225 2018-04-07 19:16:39 To firm breasts and tighten the skin, mix one teaspoon of vitamin E oil with one tablespoon of yogurt and an egg.

5229 2018-04-07 19:16:18 Maybe it's highlighter oil? Idk
5230 2018-04-07 19:16:18 A lot of very facile hot takes on Tony Robbins today. He’s a snake oil salesman. It’s a cult. He’s Trump.
The video did bug me. But I need to watch the unedited, 11 min version for context.
Bc Tony Robbins’ work has positively, dramatically impacted my life for over 20 yrs.
5231 2018-04-07 19:16:17 Coconut oil is good for your skin and hair but I hate the smell of it
5232 2018-04-07 19:16:13 What informs you that now is time to use Castor oil??or you  just stick with six months intervals ??
5233 2018-04-07 19:16:05 Some comeback that reds,pretty much written off at half time by everyone,me included,fuck off city,shove your oil money up your well fucked arse,my lad was in the away end,said United support amazing,city will never have home support like that,never mind away
5234 2018-04-07 19:16:01 Someone threw a bottle of omega 3 pills at me... Luckily my injuries were only super fish oil.
5235 2018-04-07 19:15:55 She fucking owned it though  but that was absolutely pathetic, what did he think he was hoping to achieve? 

He is a snake oil salesman. Uses his physique, chiselled jaw and deep voice to sell shit to idiots. But nobody is buying. Maybe in 1950s america.

5260 2018-04-07 19:13:53 Hi, it's Olive Oil. We all have been contemplating if after all these days you'd like to kill again.
5261 2018-04-07 19:13:48 This new Cold War has economic roots - oil and gas versus  batteries.And new emerging technologies - quantum computers and artificial intelligence.Quantum computers and AI will be used to simulate chemical reactions,discover/synthesize news materials that will compete with oil
5262 2018-04-07 19:13:28 I remember using Luster’s Pink Oil. By God, that stuff was horrible. Did more harm than good, but you couldn’t tell me that.
5263 2018-04-07 19:13:11 Finally getting my oil change I went ahead and told them to change my filters as well so it shouldn’t be nothing extra that needs to be done
5264 2018-04-07 19:13:02 Yeah. Creating jobs to clean up the inevitable environmental disasters created by lax laws that weren't being effectively enforced to begin with.
All those raises in the coal and oil industries... nevermind. Those raises are only in the stock prices.
5265 2018-04-07 19:13:01 I get paid bf maintenance fee ..... I need my oil changed too
5266 2018-04-07 19:12:59 Pro tip do you work in an ER where someone opened an emergency baby delivery tray to obtain certain equipment but now the other stuff will go to waste? Use the bulb suction to water your succulents. Use those cotton cloths to wipe/gently exfoliate your face after your oil cleanse
5267 2018-04-07 19:12:59 City without the oil money would be in league 2.. liverpool without Salah would be watford...arsenal without Wenger would be...well...4th maybe

5274 2018-04-07 19:12:04 I want to try cannabis oil
5275 2018-04-07 19:12:01 I think olive oil tastes much nicer, especially if you get a good one. The nutrition though I have no idea 
5276 2018-04-07 19:11:46 Or a Venezuela whose oil has run out.
5277 2018-04-07 19:11:44 Get yourself an essential oil diffuser, find a good devotional to read, turn on some pretty worship music, and get your life together.
5278 2018-04-07 19:11:44 One died for your soul, the other died for the oil
5279 2018-04-07 19:11:38 You should direct your anger at Washington elites who warmonger for said oil profits, not white people as a collective whole. Obama was one of these warmongering presidents, surely you know that right? I have opposed American interventionism my entire life.
5280 2018-04-07 19:11:36 I use peppermint essential oil. Local shop mixes it with lavender oil. I keep with me when traveling. Dab some on each temple and under nostrils. Also find peppermint Altoids help prevent nausea & metallic pre-seizure taste in mouth that starts the yucky aura feeling.

5292 2018-04-07 19:10:24 I use the oil but I’ve never vaped it. It tastes like oily wheatgrass shots. I use it for anxiety and it really helps.

5328 2018-04-07 19:06:10 The only differenc, this is true. Pres. Trump is to Hitler like water is to oil. As you can see by the graph above, they show similarities.

5386 2018-04-07 19:00:40 I've been wondering about gun oil... Have there been any studies to see what happens if someone absorbs too much through the skin?
5387 2018-04-07 19:00:38 For a “healthy” fast food restaurant, you’d think they would use a healthy oil like olive oil. I mean they do charge enough. 
5388 2018-04-07 19:00:26 Proper english clubs (Liv and MU) gave the oil club a reality check
5389 2018-04-07 19:00:22 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
5390 2018-04-07 19:00:13 Daily Closing Oil Price Update: 67.04 #oil #opec #oilprice #brent
5391 2018-04-07 18:59:46 It is certain that our efforts must greatly increase. At present rate we had an increase from 1 to 2 TW renewables in about 6 years. But we still have at least 16TW to cover (+growth). China has about 1TW in coal but then there is still oil,gas and the rest of the world.
5392 2018-04-07 18:59:44 He misspelled “oil” as “freedom”
5393 2018-04-07 18:59:41 Have you ever had the body oil of a raccoon in your mouth? I had a tail in my freezer in a plastic.bag.pulled out bags how tail.SUMHOW OIL GOT ON MY HANDS! I did not touch the tail.roflmao. worst dirty sock I EVER TASTED!!!

5401 2018-04-07 18:58:55 Take your oil Miguel
5402 2018-04-07 18:58:45 It’s the cheap ass oil they use to cook their food in. It’s the one negative thing I criticize about their food.
5403 2018-04-07 18:58:45 過去の例がいっぱいあるな
5404 2018-04-07 18:58:44 Not much, bit I added plenty of chili oil
5405 2018-04-07 18:58:38 Fish oil tastes like fish. 
Coconut oil tastes like coconut.
Baby oil tastes like babies.
5406 2018-04-07 18:58:36 I read a Tony Robbins book once. There were occasional passages of good inspirational advice, surrounded by pages and pages and pages of inane filler. Had to read the Kindle version since the printed books come soaked in snake oil.
5407 2018-04-07 18:58:28 I have an innovative idea! Let's make sure oil/gas is limited, but fairly. So give everyone a, let's call it a coupon. You can only buy gas with a coupon. Then, to save the rainforest, one for tires. Maybe put them in a booklet for convenience? To save wetlands, food coupons.
5408 2018-04-07 18:58:15 Oil change rn what’s good
5409 2018-04-07 18:58:01 Karachi: Shireen Jinnah Colony Me Oil Filed K Tank Me Dhamaka, 2 Afrad Janbahaq, 3 Zakhmi * Sindh Se PML-N K MNA Ramesh Kumar #PTIMe Shamil
5410 2018-04-07 18:57:56 He’s a snake oil salesman. But worse than that now.
5411 2018-04-07 18:57:55 Yes it’s earned.. I’ll give you that... but the rich keep getting richer in football today... if oil money can help a club compete,so be it. No harm at all in that. Trophies can’t be won without money today. That’s the truth.And look what your team can do when mou let’s them play
5412 2018-04-07 18:57:51 This is what Manchester United are all about. 

No amount of oil money can bring City even close to what my club is.

5415 2018-04-07 18:57:31 That argument is meant to misdirect from the lack of merit of your arguments and the fact that your beliefs have NOTHING to do with Jesus Christ. You’re a snake oil salesman exploiting religion for personal gain.

5431 2018-04-07 18:56:12 To the extent China buys $ & Yuan oil simultaneously outcome is a $/Yuan rate by reference to oil. If they set Yuan floor (eg 400 Yuan/bbl) & can then drop $ price x% by pulling their bid, then they will have implicitly revalued Yuan vs $ & lowered $ oil price for everyone else
5432 2018-04-07 18:56:07 “He noted that oil and agriculture companies could benefit if the protections are stripped, as they are now prohibited from harming the habitats of threatened species.”

AS WE HAVE ALL THE OIL AND OTHER GREAT EXPORT TAX WINNERS
THAT KEEP ENGLAND AFLOAT
5441 2018-04-07 18:55:00 They will just spend more. Don't be distracted.
5442 2018-04-07 18:54:43 .he's always been a hack, in the day he sold snake oil, he's sold the Brooklyn bridge thousands of times to the unwitting, he'll always have followers.... #Trumpets.
5443 2018-04-07 18:54:13 Cardassians, because they are basically space dark elves. Honorable yet cunning is such an oil/water mixture. I would watch a pure Cardassian series juxtaposing Bajoran occupation and Dominion occupation.
5444 2018-04-07 18:54:06 Nah we didn’t win a league.. we won fuck all but all that oil money and so much more cannot be compared to supporting Manchester United 
5445 2018-04-07 18:53:43 No snake oil for me. Thanks.
5446 2018-04-07 18:53:39 @neilashton_   You will need sick buckets and first aid staff on hand in the morning , you bitter biased blue loving pep arse kissing embarrassments must be gutted .  Start burning the midnight oil looking for Utd / Jose negatives !

5449 2018-04-07 18:53:22 Hmmmm...that might be fun? For me, personally, I don’t like sketching with anything that has too much noise. I think I’m wanting something smooth like an oil brush, but with a more refined tip?? Yes I’m on PS
5450 2018-04-07 18:53:20 A psychic at a real estate marketing conference.. is there a snake oil salesperson too?? Seems fitting they'd all be there.
5451 2018-04-07 18:53:13 We all know who he represents. He has no concern about the environment - only cares about his gas & oil buddies...

5455 2018-04-07 18:52:44 I've been taking castor oil! It's a laxative but helps put you in labor !
5456 2018-04-07 18:52:42 I took oil of oregano vitamins because it’s a natural cleaner for the inside of your body to wipe out all the bad stuff
5457 2018-04-07 18:52:41 I hate having a car. I dont even want one anymore. I’m tired of paying for gas and oil changes and car washes and all the necessities when the car needs to be fixed. Imma just go back to riding the bus idc

5463 2018-04-07 18:52:13 Tony Robbins is like a cross between Trump & Deepak Chopra - a self-important quasi-authority on Branding® nebulous bullshit that sells fantasy to desperate #wannabelievers.  They’re postmodern revival tent preachers with snake oil hustles, which is as American as it gets.
5464 2018-04-07 18:52:10 Because Obama had to fix the mess W left.  3 trillion of that debt went right to Cheney's company to pay for the hardware used in Iraq war.  Which went well for the oil and weapons families.
5465 2018-04-07 18:51:52 Oil CNY ???
5466 2018-04-07 18:51:50 I don’t disagree. But fossil fuels aren’t going away for decades. It disgusts me you’d rather, indirectly, subsidize Trumps oil economy rather than allowing ours to prosper. Make no mistake. That’s who benefits. Trump.
5467 2018-04-07 18:51:48 He’s brought them nada
Pep won it in second year 

Don’t bring up oil money like ManU isn’t out there spending stupid money too 

Pep is way better 
And they play better 
Sitting back with the best players in the world is fuckin wack
5468 2018-04-07 18:51:48 Oil equals pipeline
5469 2018-04-07 18:51:46 Oil is at 60$ a barrel that's no boom.

5471 2018-04-07 18:51:30 But the depreciation of the dollar will lead to an increase in oil price, therefore the trade balance won’t be affected.
5472 2018-04-07 18:51:24 The old goats at the Masters and Augusta National are like the Mobil Oil "executives" who once got the moronic idea to try to direct taste in literature and film. Suck-heads.

A: “Nin kuu digay kuma dilin.”

B: “Biyo dhul baa laga helaa waana laga dhoowraa.”

A: You warned you were ignored.

B: You told watch out “Soma Oil&Gas” you were ignored again.
Let them dance together for a while.
5478 2018-04-07 18:50:56 False notion immigration reform will fix this. Never will everyone wanting to come here be let in. Ones not let in,  still cross illegally
5479 2018-04-07 18:50:48 Disgustingly crazy! Something as basic as power!! Tufiakwa!!! 
For a country that discovered oil in 1956 and have been a top 10 producer for decades. 
Embarrassing. Our RULERS have no shame.

5481 2018-04-07 18:50:35 To clarify, we found that most (68%) of the black carbon emitted from ships (not all sources) in the Arctic came from heavy fuel oil (HFO) as opposed to cleaner marine diesel fuels. Using cleaner fuels, instead of HFO, reduces BC by at least a third and up to 80%.

5483 2018-04-07 18:50:24 Yes but...    it makes them look like crooks.  Which they are, but it's harder to understand stealing a Trillion Dollars ($10^12) lubricating an oil deal with Putin, than stealing 100k ($10^5) for some party trip to Paris.
5484 2018-04-07 18:50:23 Oklahoma has flourishing oil, gas and wind industries. I don’t know why they don’t have money for their children’s education. Absolutely shameful. The $40m the state legislature offered for books was a drop in the bucket.

5492 2018-04-07 18:49:12 I used to want to do work and create things everyday. Now I’ll go like a week or two and the mood hits me and I’ll create all kinds of shit. I’ve tweaked and created two sprays, created my first oil, and did 2 candles this week. I haven’t felt like this in awhile.

5495 2018-04-07 18:48:48 @MBlancett & @SenStanislawski - NO NEW TAXES & RESTRICTIONS ON CLEAN WIND ENERGY! We urge you to reject House Bills 3710 & 3711 and Senate Bill 1567.

5498 2018-04-07 18:48:13 Totally agree! Thank you. That is why the PM needs to support both. We are not yet at either or.. we need both green energy and oil and gas

5506 2018-04-07 18:47:44 Another point: Oil & Gas gets to write off charitable contributions. State teachers will no longer be able to deduct classroom expenses. This isn't a point about any villains but rather an observation of our current system.
5507 2018-04-07 18:47:43 Because either they can’t keep hands to themselves or the woman will lie?  Go away @TonyRobbins snake oil misogynist.
5508 2018-04-07 18:47:34 Yah...you guys really need that trophy and a 9 more to get ahead of arsenal. Not sure how long pep is gonna carry your club, maybe till oil money runs dry?

5511 2018-04-07 18:47:10 Tbh they don’t need to do f*ck all you say you orangutan. So not only do you want to steal a sovereign countries oil, you also want to dictate policy for another sovereign country. You really don’t know how to make friends do you?
5512 2018-04-07 18:46:59 When you realize Oil money can't buy you class 
5513 2018-04-07 18:46:57 Unlike the oil companies who always tell the truth about their environmentally damaging practices.  Give us a break with this propaganda.

5515 2018-04-07 18:46:54 Abi and Mugen would not know or admit the close relation between oil prices and inflation. “Napababa ni Aquino ang inflation”. hahahahaha. To be fair, pinagbigyan ko ang hirit nya na yun

America is creating chaos in middle east cause they want their oil.

5523 2018-04-07 18:46:12 I don’t think that’s the case that they brand themselves as a team that’s worked hard for success we all know the reason they’re where they are is cus of the oil money but right now you can’t really blame them with the way the football economy is going nowadays
5524 2018-04-07 18:46:11 Manchester derby is never pointless. We absolutely love smashing arab oil cunts. 
5525 2018-04-07 18:46:02 Esa, la que ganaste gracias a lavado de dinero por Tinelli y oil combustibles. Aparte de llamarse la "peor copa libertadores" contra un paraguayo y con un gol de penal

5528 2018-04-07 18:45:47 This is common sense. No immigration reform will stop illegal entry. System will always be " broken" since we are never going to admit all.

5536 2018-04-07 18:45:02 We have so much open space WITH NOTHING IN IT. A fraction of that used for solar energy can create huge advantages. My guess is that "it's too expensive" and the efforts of oil/gas lobby is preventing it.
5537 2018-04-07 18:44:56 And they genuinely displace oil & gas - I think they will be a great thing when they become more widely deployed.

I'm interested in watching how the home storage market develops...
5538 2018-04-07 18:44:47 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
5539 2018-04-07 18:44:47 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5540 2018-04-07 18:44:47 Basically the same thing. Cept a lighter oil cause .25. Then again I use the same thing on my Union .25 so meh? Clean it well though. Lotta buildup on the rear slide rails.

5557 2018-04-07 18:43:01 So why am I paying $3.50/gal for gas if we went to war for oil. I mean besides we have Democrats turning California into a sh1thole state.

5578 2018-04-07 18:40:40 An interesting (although different) argument, that development and rollout of replacement energy tech will be outpaced by the collapse of oil and gas?  I’ll add that to the reading list.  Then we’ll watch how it pans out in reality and compare notes in 2030..!

5585 2018-04-07 18:39:49 Say that when America can produce its own goods and not rely on foreign countries. Angry about oil prices? Stop doing business with OPEC and pump out all of America’s oil. China is charging us on goods? Close manufacturing there and have American kids do it here... oh, wait...
5586 2018-04-07 18:39:47 Yes. There's also a privacy bias toward technical people. Because technology is difficult and obscure, you get 21st century snake oil solutions like the hyper cynical Facebook VPN app
5587 2018-04-07 18:39:46 Beard oil.
5588 2018-04-07 18:39:42 Actually, yes many of the oil sands operations did pay for it themselves and still pay royalties on top of that  One exception is Redwater refinery. The question has always been how MUCH royalties do they pay. Solar & wind are not paying any royalties and are a cost to the Govt.

5594 2018-04-07 18:38:48 @CanadaAction have you guys ever toyed with the idea of having ‘Canadian cerified’ gasoline? i.e. if the oil is sourced and refined in Canada it comes with verification at Shell, Petro-Can etc. Might help wake people up as to where there oil actually comes from.
5595 2018-04-07 18:38:45 IMO Selena, Tony is just another snake oil salesman who is preemptively attacking for when his victims start to speak out.  We’ve seen this show/episode before.
5596 2018-04-07 18:38:24 His supporters are the past.

Climate change denial, corporate supremacy, bigotry, coal, oil, etc.

5815 2018-04-07 18:24:17 All the champagne bottles, all the party poppers, all the oil money up your ass. Manchester is red. Yessssssssssssssssssssss, come on united. Best match of the season. #mufc #MCIMUN
5816 2018-04-07 18:24:14 May not be the correct term. It’s like when my hair is a shorter length my hair products I’m using are just fine but once my hair gets to my shoulders I can’t control it. Seems I need more antihair breakage products, water based products vs. a bunch of oil based products
5817 2018-04-07 18:24:11 BRO WE'VE WON FUCK FOOTBALL WE KEEP IT MOVING U OIL MONEY PRICKS
5818 2018-04-07 18:23:59 Mexico has the money and resources, they are number one in silver production, they have oil, two beautiful coastlines, let them take care of these migrants for once. We have millions of people “in this country” that need help or can’t eat, homeless, these people come first.
5819 2018-04-07 18:23:58 PSA: if you became a Man City fan after they got their oil money you’re a BIG loser. Massive #GGMU
5820 2018-04-07 18:23:57 Most important is where oil demand would have been without EVs compared to with EVs.
5821 2018-04-07 18:23:53 I guess oil money can’t buy me happiness  #ManchesterDerby
5822 2018-04-07 18:23:52 I need to do an oil treatment. My hair is so dry n frizzy
5823 2018-04-07 18:23:50 This week - Oil money 0 big clubs 2
5824 2018-04-07 18:23:49 Doesn’t matter how much dodgy oil money they spend, how many titles they win, they’ll always be City. The gift that keeps on giving.
5825 2018-04-07 18:23:46 Dirty oil cash can buy you Jesús...but it can't buy you salvation from United's shadow #knowYourLevels @ManUtd #ManchesterDerby #mufc
5826 2018-04-07 18:23:43 Oil Sheikh's plaything  masquerading as a football club....
5827 2018-04-07 18:23:39 Hahaha let's go @ManUtd the oil company club is a joke
5828 2018-04-07 18:23:36 Who’s “we” ? Like say we dey chop the oil money with Y”all, mad bastard
5829 2018-04-07 18:23:34 I didn’t say or imply that you are solely to blame. Only that demand causes pipelines, not production. 

You act as though we’re pumping oil and forcing it down peoples’ throats, and if we’d only stop that, you could have your green utopia.

5833 2018-04-07 18:23:24 To firm breasts and tighten the skin, mix one teaspoon of vitamin E oil with one tablespoon of yogurt and an egg.
5834 2018-04-07 18:23:19 Only thing I'd see is the Vitamin E which is like from Sunflower Seed Oil, sometimes can be derived other ways. But, it seems like it's safe. - I know you and @SilverCheetahMC both being from Netherlands means most stuff says Vegetarian vs Vegan. So maybe they haven't had it-

5840 2018-04-07 18:22:40 If it was burning that much oil the motor prolly was no good anyway ...but you should check your oil every time u fill yo tank up to be safe 
5841 2018-04-07 18:22:37 And i will say this yes organic products. Bottled an advertised are more expensive but thats just it. Its another mainstream giant looking to make a profit of impulsive buyers. I told a chick i used food grade cocunut oil as lotion moisturizer and sometimes for fragrance..
5842 2018-04-07 18:22:34 i can only imagine what follows is a crash course in ley lines, geometry, numerology, and essential oil pairings
5843 2018-04-07 18:21:52 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, I shopped with you today. Will be watching carefully#ProtectAntarctic

5853 2018-04-07 18:21:06 After the week I've had, I need a hot oil treatment, head to toe.
Can't wait to get home and do laundry and snuggle with Jaxson. He's finally feeling better. 
5854 2018-04-07 18:21:00 but it smelled good!

now I use ~African Royale Hot Six Oil~
5855 2018-04-07 18:20:59 Ohhhhh they are expensive. But it’s quality oil.
5856 2018-04-07 18:20:54 My sister checking out from an apothecary. 
Mom: what did you get?
Me: she got some oil and a rock
Sister: I got an essential oil inhaler and a lapis stone.

5858 2018-04-07 18:20:51 Love olive oil!  This Taste of Game  extra virgin olive oil sounds fabulous!
5859 2018-04-07 18:20:49 I have been told by an insider that this is a well planned campaign to increase revenue. Fake shortage produced by not running oil based plants. Will force loadshedding in all areas. Pressure week be used to get additional gas/subsidy on oil out increase in tariff.
5860 2018-04-07 18:20:29 He tell him I miss you , I love you , give me oil hhhhh he was so adorable and funny
5861 2018-04-07 18:20:26 To those who have an ear:  We cannot allow ourselves to be caught without our spiritual and physical oil in our lamps while we prepare for the days of trouble that will precede the day of joy and gladness.

5864 2018-04-07 18:20:22 OMG my mom used so many of these in my hair Pink oil moisturizer, Dax, royal crown, ultra sheen, mane n tail, African pride AND Sulfur 8. LOL.
5865 2018-04-07 18:20:22 But you can bet California will be seeing more oil derricks off coast!

5870 2018-04-07 18:19:57 Will clothes extenuate the degree of burns from the hot oil?

5873 2018-04-07 18:19:50 I don’t understand why people listen to these types to begin with. Modern day snake oil salesmen.
5874 2018-04-07 18:19:49 Had my first Chinese restaurant meal in four months and I feel sick as a dog. So apparently you can train your body to hate oil / fat. Ugh!
5875 2018-04-07 18:19:43 I STILL love for a good VO5 hot oil treatment.
5876 2018-04-07 18:19:29 Internal company documents uncovered by a Dutch news organization show that the oil giant Shell had a deep understanding, dating at least to the 1980s, of the science and risks of global warming caused by fossil fuel emissions.
5877 2018-04-07 18:19:24 Of course they do. The Sheiks took it to a whole new level  Chelsea got the Russian Oligarchs, Man U got the American Money, Liverpool and Arsenal were reluctant to spend money at all until now. PSG and City were nothing until Oil money came through lol
5878 2018-04-07 18:19:21 When you’re laying by the pool and jolt from your relaxation bc you think there’s a bug on your side but it’s really just one of your skin rolls slipping of out of position from the oil... #notfat #itsjustskin....

5891 2018-04-07 18:17:24 Jgh. Done with car's change oil and tyres. Im tired but felt assured for my travels.
5892 2018-04-07 18:17:22 A really useful Public Service Announcement. Plus a timely reminder of a particular group of stocks which are phenomenally leveraged to any sustained recovery in oil above the mid $60s per barrel, Thank so much!!!
5893 2018-04-07 18:17:17 Today has been a do the laundry, read a lot, make an olive oil scrub for your hands sort of a day.
5894 2018-04-07 18:17:04 Yeah, tea trea oil is more for oily skin cause it is very drying.
5895 2018-04-07 18:17:02 Hmm, my friend didn't have the same lung issues with the oil. Maybe it's because I'm a regular vaper, too. All day long. Dunno, my body's been doing weird shit lately.
5896 2018-04-07 18:16:40 Oklahoma, with all your oil money, you can’t provide your children with decent educations? Shame on you.
5897 2018-04-07 18:16:39 Yes. I used to test orange oil in the lab & I’d inevitably end up with a migraine. Satsumas & other citrus I’m fine with..
5898 2018-04-07 18:16:33 Look at all those vehicles and trailers in the background. How were any of those possible without oil? Hypocritical
5899 2018-04-07 18:16:25 They better not touch my AC.
5900 2018-04-07 18:16:23 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
5901 2018-04-07 18:16:20 lmao girl ain’t had no oil in her shit
5902 2018-04-07 18:16:18 liverpool and united teaming up for the anti oil agenda
5903 2018-04-07 18:16:13 Nope, just means it absorbs moisture quickly and loses it quickly too. Your hair probably feels dry despite constant application of moisture. It just simply means you need heavier leave in conditioners and creams and seal in with oil for the moisture to last.
5904 2018-04-07 18:15:57 If Pruit goes that will be the last one that's doing anything constructive. Secretary of the Interior Zinke has already reversed the previous position of allowing oil and gas development off the coast of Florida and says he'll probably put the entire West Coast off limits.
5905 2018-04-07 18:15:53 Tony Robbins is a bullshit artists selling snake oil.  It’s about the man making money.

5908 2018-04-07 18:15:35 Tony Robbins was always on some snake oil salesman shit to me. Find something ppl can put their faith into and charge the hell outta them for it no matter if it actually helps them or not. Motivation in the moment isn’t a sustainable commodity, you always need more.
5909 2018-04-07 18:15:22 a hot bath with epsom salts or coconut oil helps me, i don’t know if this is considered a natural remedy lol
5910 2018-04-07 18:15:21 He’s promoting his snake oil. The only change it has made to his body is the spray tan.

5914 2018-04-07 18:15:11 I'm afraid the entire global society is reliant on oil... without it nothing works irrespective what theory you do or don't believe in.
5915 2018-04-07 18:15:10 RT @LivingSafely: Eating mayonnaise this April? It's made by adding oil to egg yolks. Commercial mayo can be as much as 80% fat!
5916 2018-04-07 18:15:07 Trying to get an oil change I literally got so anxious cause I didn’t know how to do a jiffy lube so I literally just drove away 
5917 2018-04-07 18:15:00 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

5934 2018-04-07 18:12:42 Could not agree more, he's nothing but an egocentric snake oil salesmen, dime a dozen, but there's a sucker around every corner willing to listen to his BS.
5935 2018-04-07 18:12:29 Economic freedom, personal liberty, an accountable and efficient government, rule of law, strong defense...all of these benefit all of us, including gay people.  So when is economic freedom not a "gay issue"?

5940 2018-04-07 18:12:10 How has your country helped Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan? Your country has taken up a base in the oil rich areas of Syria. So much for fighting ISIS. #country

5942 2018-04-07 18:12:02 just want to exist in an environment where my coconut oil is always the right consistency... not liquid but pliable
5943 2018-04-07 18:12:01 Groupon sometimes has oil change deals. Maybe there’s a shop offering that in your city
5944 2018-04-07 18:12:00 Thanks for coming oil city

Its Useful only for Brainwashed Bhakts
5946 2018-04-07 18:11:45 Yes when Oil money made its presence just like all man city fans 
5947 2018-04-07 18:11:35 That is not accurate, Ethiopia was paying in birr and oil it refines in asseb, which it buys with dollars. Not to mention, Eritrea use to buy Ethiopian goods in birr and sell it dollars...among other mischievous. Its was a classic case of blackmail.
5948 2018-04-07 18:11:34 Next thing you know they will regulate silverware and require everyone to use PLASTIC Sporks. They they have to ban electric in case you try to electrocute someone. No more oil, or candles, because you can put a person on fire. Glass will be banned because it cuts like a knife..
5949 2018-04-07 18:11:29 แต่อยู่ตอนเบื้องหลังใช่ไหมคะ 555 หนูชื้อแค่ bon 1 ค่ะ ไม่ได้ชื้อ bon 2 เลยไม่ได้ดูเลย ว่าแต่ bon 2 มี มม. official อะไรไหมคะ ?555
5950 2018-04-07 18:11:12 Oh well, you’re conveniently off the hook then! You can keep using oil while castigating the people making it for you, and there’s no apparent hypocrisy!

Enjoy your self-serving logic pretzel.
5951 2018-04-07 18:11:04 Sam... I gather you realize the term SOLAR = Fossil Fuel Derivatives... correct.  Furthermore, the world's farming industry only works when we pour oil and natural gas in the soil.  What am I missing here???
5952 2018-04-07 18:10:51 Oooh I gotcha. I thought you meant over the sword like a glaze of Guilliman Blue. I did actually shade the model using a 2:1 of Drakenhof to Nuln Oil. It's more blue than black and not really dark.
5953 2018-04-07 18:10:37 My theory.....Justin Trudeau is getting paid a LOT of money to destroy oil/gas industry. Trudeau foundation needs unbiased audit, let’s follow the money!
5954 2018-04-07 18:10:31 if you put baby oil or Vaseline on em after a shower and then socks, they’ll be mad soft
5955 2018-04-07 18:10:17 I really wish the haloscope highlighter didn’t have coconut oil in it. It looks gorgeous on me but it breaks me out immediately

5963 2018-04-07 18:10:04 1ev=~1house, so would require doubling the amount of transformers at 110v charging. 220v fast charge you need to upgrade substations. At home and destination. Huge $$$ to roll this out.

5965 2018-04-07 18:09:49 Feels so cool and included when they talking their mechanic talk in front of you as they change your oil and check your car out lol

5973 2018-04-07 18:09:22 Loans secured against overseas oil are subject to political risk. A less transparent approach is Enron-style prepay deals. But neither of these claims over oil affects the dollar's function of unit of account for pricing these transactions
5974 2018-04-07 18:09:22 i hate waiting for an oil change
5975 2018-04-07 18:09:21 thank you. endometriosis has affected my ability to work & live for many years. no one has ever believed me, until I became addicted to heroin (for the love of pain relief) thankfully, today, I am a few years sober, & wiser. my answer: diet, exercise, cbd oil & no pharmaceuticals

5986 2018-04-07 18:08:17 Ya know, @RepMimiWalters, the people who support and lobby for Pruitt are the oil and gas bigwigs. They do not want Pruitt fired for his corruption. You're a big fan of oil and gas, do you support Pruitt too? Do you even care? #CA45

5994 2018-04-07 18:07:29 maybe the queen could join a disinvestment scheme and stop profiting from oil, rio tinto, most of the major polluters, deforesting, extracting industries that her family has been enriched over the last few hundred years?

6010 2018-04-07 18:05:55 They took the Western economies off the gold standard and linked it to the Arab oil reserve....so the petro dollar is financing all the brother wars and Islamic terrorism.....two birds with one stone...keeping nations subjugated and people enslaved.
6011 2018-04-07 18:05:54 This sounds like old timey snake oil salesman circus

I honestly don’t know if that’s  bullshit.   Even deregulation is work which these imbeciles seem incapable of.

6067 2018-04-07 17:59:56 And THIS is a big reason why Obama (and therefore his SOS, Clinton) promoted fracking. It wasn’t about making fracking companies wealthy  It was about the creeping threat of authoritarianism & countries ending their dependence on Putin controlled oil & gas

6069 2018-04-07 17:59:55 This memo does not matter much. During the latest years Russian oil technology has developed greatly on its own to a degree that Russia is now shopping its own shale oil/gas technologies to UAE and other places. Ultimately, the limitations help Russia more than hurt.

6116 2018-04-07 17:55:48 If pipelines were based on evidence and all that good stuff, energy east should have gone ahead.  No mountain range to cross, Canadian use of Canadian resource, less dependence on foreign oil, not beholden to world market forces for sale of resource. @justintrudeau

  If I ask today  why the price is so high today then at the same time I should ask why I got Master degree now?I should hv bn in classII

6122 2018-04-07 17:55:29 So today I was putting oil in my car in the Walmart parking lot and this guy came up and asked me what I was doing and after a long conversation he asked for my number and to take me on a date I guess it’s unusual for girls to do stuff on their own?

6252 2018-04-07 17:43:26 The US imports 8 million barrels of oil per DAY... and then we BURN it... think at the waste in resources and economic development... and that is in addition to our own production ... horrible if you think about it.
6253 2018-04-07 17:43:21 i need two new tires, new brake pads, oil changed, tires rotated, and my bumper fixed but i have a total of $2.67 in my bank account 
6254 2018-04-07 17:43:17 Exactly!!! No wonder they are tired of being attacked for land, for oil for revenge.  I would be pissed too.  So would you!!
6255 2018-04-07 17:43:09 yeah use the oil thing. they'll be back faster than you know it. you gon be straight

6257 2018-04-07 17:42:51 I didn’t say that. It is nevertheless one of the primary consumers of prairie oil. 

If you weren’t using prairie oil, you’d be using someone else’s. So how are the producers responsible for the greenhouse gases caused by your use of oil?

6271 2018-04-07 17:41:36 You believe BC has no responsibility for demand for prairie oil because much of the refining happens outside of Canada?

If you didn’t use the oil we wouldn’t be digging it up and refining it. If we stopped making/transporting it, you’d still be using oil. 

How are we the cause?

6296 2018-04-07 17:39:13 EVs will displace oil eventually. The thermal efficiency of an electric motor (~90%) compared to the internal combustion engine (15-20%) is just too overwhelming. Now it's all about battery energy density and we're getting a little better at that every year.

6390 2018-04-07 17:29:56 The Morning Son and its rays hiccuped in agreement with Kristin Fisher, yesterday on "Special Report with Bret Baier," that thanks to President Trump's Pro-Energy policies "the U.S. stands to be the World's largest oil producer by 2023."
6391 2018-04-07 17:29:55 People are dying in schools, at concerts, in churches. Relocating and adding to the abuse of the poor is not preferable to addressing the situation where they are.
6392 2018-04-07 17:29:29 What I learned at the dia today: 1st century athletes used to rub olive oil all over themselves before workouts.... then sold their dirty, sweaty olive oil to people to make them better athletes...... fu*kin savage bro
6393 2018-04-07 17:29:15 And most likely made somewhere in Asia where all these extra oil tankers you’re pushing for us to accept would be going, if real people like us didn’t stand up and say NO.

6400 2018-04-07 17:28:31 No. Neither side is REALLY trying to correct anything but give an appearance while maintaining political/econ advantages. Ex. No wall.
6401 2018-04-07 17:28:29 US raised rates, USD rose, EM borrowings in USD became more onerous, FX reserves burned down to try to support currency, ultimately didnt work, currencies collapsed v. USD.  Many believe this will happen to China.  CNY oil/gold means China can prevent this fr happening.
6402 2018-04-07 17:28:18 No  although I did read today that coconut oil is the most effective (apart from scissors) for getting gum out, so I shall remember that.

6406 2018-04-07 17:27:50 I usually leave it on all day. Tie it up and forget about it. Then wash it out as normal. Also do the same with argon oil. The ordinary do a really good one. Same thing but usually overnight on that. My hair needs work to keep it nice.

6413 2018-04-07 17:27:17 I support stopping subsidies, and I’d even support nationalizing the oil so we can use it to pay off the national debt. 

I don’t support people who use lots of oil getting mad at us meeting their demand.

6456 2018-04-07 17:22:13 That level of support has opened Cruz to criticism that donors are influencing his policies, whether on abortion, energy or the gold standard. Ethanol advocates point to his oil and gas donors as the reason he wants to discontinue that government subsidy for the corn-based fuel.

6471 2018-04-07 17:20:54 But oil being piped to BC is not just for export. It is also for domestic consumption. If BC users used less, existing pipelines might meet demand for BC and export. 

Either way, using less is the solution. Not forcing the use of risker modes of transport.

6491 2018-04-07 17:19:15 basically yes, like the difference is in shampoo there’s a different agent in comparison to co wash, people who have curly/coily hair need to keep a little natural oil left in their hair after a wash and sometimes shampoo restricts a lot that oil making it dryer
6492 2018-04-07 17:19:14 This is how well trickle down economics work plus giving too many tax breaks to oil.

6495 2018-04-07 17:19:00 I love olive oil
6496 2018-04-07 17:18:57 Not simply bc of oil prices.  It’s also due to state budget decisions going on for years that have resulted in the current situation. It’s not like teachers were making excellent money when oil prices had left state coffers well-stocked.

6504 2018-04-07 17:18:15 You're right about the general statement, but if oil is only being piped through western Canada for other markets, reducing western Canada's demand for oil is not going to stop the pipelines.  I agree that reducing demand for oil is beneficial.

6514 2018-04-07 17:17:24 Your hypocritical views on oil and pipelines does nothing but harm Canada. End of story. The entire world uses oil and will continue to do so. Why should we not benefit from that not only as individuals but as a country? (Notice no mention of race)

6533 2018-04-07 17:16:01 3 eggs. Little bit of milk. Fluff it. Heat olive oil in a smaller (Frisch a pancake size) pan. Pour in egg and milk mix. Cover with a glass lid on medium heat until the top bubbles a bit. Then add toppings and cover again for 2-3 min. Add cheese. Cover again for 1-2 min. Flip one

6542 2018-04-07 17:15:19 What I want to know is why Middow (or anyone on @MSNBC) is not covering what Pruitt is doong st the @EPA damaging our air, water, & health? Obviously all fir the oil, coal, & gas industry! 

You only cover this salacious stuff, ... and Russia.  More breadth!
6543 2018-04-07 17:15:18 At a conference... publicly challenged the VP of MPLX (Marathon conglomerate) on the ethics of a) the corporation and b) the oil industry. It's safe to say I'm living my best life :)

たぶん彼らは、私がいんちき薬か何かを売り込もうとしていると思ったのでしょう。
6548 2018-04-07 17:14:54 I could say the same thing about someone who doubtlessly uses a lot of oil, but gets mad at people responding to that demand. 

If we are going to accept that oil production is a problem, we cannot strictly blame the producer provinces. Oil users are responsible as well.

6558 2018-04-07 17:14:27 Salesmanship that reeks of snake oil isn't enough? (Admittedly, that may simply be a very European view of US rah-rah can-do approaches...)
6559 2018-04-07 17:14:12 #ProtectAntarcticI am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic?

6571 2018-04-07 17:13:02 What is the big deal about @sanchurro_cafe really? They use refried oil that smells absolutely gross. The churros, even though crisp, tasted foul because of the oil. Feel sick already 
6572 2018-04-07 17:13:01 Considering how @ManUtd are going down at the Etihad, they might end up discovering oil
6573 2018-04-07 17:13:01 Is the CA California or Eh Ca meaning Canada...Canada has the pipelines. And the oil. Canada says eh? All the time. Or is EH Eric Holder...

6583 2018-04-07 17:12:27 It is absolutely the people that are the issue.  Look at Ireland.  4th, 5th, or 6th in GDP per capita.  Some of the most productive people in the world, who were instrumental in building America.  The only thing that keeps Scotland afloat is North Sea oil and gas.
6584 2018-04-07 17:12:04 @TonyRobbins #metoo.  You make me sick.  Shame on you.  You’re just a snake oil salesman.

6589 2018-04-07 17:11:29 I doubt there’d be as much demand for pipelines if BC, and everyone else in Western Canada, used less oil. 

The only point I’m making is, demand causes pipelines, not production. Want less pipelines? Use less oil. 

That should not be controversial.

6610 2018-04-07 17:09:22 depending on how your hair texture responds to oil, it might help to comb in some oil/plant fat before you braid or bun it! I use shea butter or avocado oil usually, it helps the hairs group together without turning into mats! might buy you a few days

6613 2018-04-07 17:09:10 As of September 2014, foreigners owned $6.06 trillion of U.S. debt, or approximately 47% of the debt held by the public of $12.8 trillion and 34% of the total debt of $17.8 trillion. The largest holders were China, Japan, Belgium, the Caribbean banking centers, and oil exporters.

6626 2018-04-07 17:08:02 I occasionaly apply oil on certain areas.
6627 2018-04-07 17:07:54 if you have anxiety, I have learned to put a lavender essential oil on your wrist and behind ur ear... if u feel ur anxiety coming, inhale the oil!!! It’s literally the best for me!!!!

6649 2018-04-07 17:06:14 MBS couldn't reach Ataturk's trouser cuff.

I suppose he believes he's going to import a "start up" mentality to revitalize his country's oil dependent economy.

He will be seen as Trump's and Netanyahu's creature. He could actually create reform now and still be reviled.

6659 2018-04-07 17:05:26 1) Given how many people tell me how many "poor" people r in China, I suspect oil demand will be fine.  2) PBOC announced they'd stopped "taking the USD's" over 4 yrs ago.  3) OBOR neutralizes navy, & hypersonic weapons neutralize carriers.  Carriers now like battleships pre-WW2

I’ve been ordering the same sandwich since then; pepper turkey, Muenster cheese, lettuce, Tomato, salt pepper oil and vinegar in a roll.
They named that sandwich El Marcy.
All the kids order it.
I’m basically a hood staple.
6672 2018-04-07 17:04:38 qnal is getting an oil change, and I'm so hungry bc I haven't eaten all day. it's ok though bc I have to treat my baby right.
6673 2018-04-07 17:04:33 I find that statement abhorrent. People are real people. I've never used the term "illegal" it's undocumented. So I don't know who's telling you this. The very idea that anyone is a sub class, or sub human is an issue all to itself

6684 2018-04-07 17:03:42 BJP wanted to make OIL free from traitor particles hence appointed Dambit as Director of ONGC. Bhakts now feel more nationalist riding their cars filled with fuel from ONGC...I don't see any other reason for Dambit's appointment!!!
6685 2018-04-07 17:03:38 Interesting to follow the money.. All of it starts with big oil and banks...
6686 2018-04-07 17:03:29 I should be at home working on the stream.... but I'm stuck at the dealership getting an oil change.   Still... long day stream coming after lunch today!
6687 2018-04-07 17:03:28 A side of veg with every meal was usual. Always used to increase fat, ghee, butter, olive oil, cheese. tbh I didn’t think I could live w/o broccoli but I never even think about it. Forgot all about veg soon after starting ZC. Nuts were usually a snack food for me.
6688 2018-04-06 23:59:55 I want lumpia but I just did all of the things to get rid of the fried oil smell from Tuesday.
6689 2018-04-06 23:59:49 I wish I could sanction people to keep 'em quiet! It's like, yeah man, you better shut your mouth or I'll sanction it! And your ass. No oil for either of them! Import or exports! I'm a meanie.
6690 2018-04-06 23:59:46 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

6698 2018-04-06 23:58:28 Adult diapers, some sort of nipple balm (coconut oil works well), some cooling breast pads, and maybe some milk savers. Snacks for the stay after the baby is born because you may not be fed immediately after.

6702 2018-04-06 23:57:01 Interesting exercise to compare these examples to the days of Standard Oil.

For the record, I'm all for strong anti-trust, but I'm skeptical it's an active issue in the market at the moment. (It doesn't rank in the top 10 concerns I hear from venture-backed startup founders.)
6703 2018-04-06 23:56:55 I hope I don’t get blocked, but I think BP is correct. Capitalism thrives on the rape and destruction of Nature. An oil spill is disaster capitalism par excellence. Lots of money to be made from killing life.
6704 2018-04-06 23:56:38 Pipelines form a network across the continent. All 4 lines that cross the border that were approved and built under Harper allow Canadian oil to access global markets. Ever heard of Cushing, Wood River, Steele City, Houston and other major hubs?

6726 2018-04-06 23:56:15 Capital is leaving Canada because of the U.S. American shale is cheaper to bring up from the ground. The Oil sands require a higher oil price to be profitable. It was trending down well before the NDP and the Liberals took over.
6727 2018-04-06 23:56:07 Now map that to oil prices....
6728 2018-04-06 23:55:51 Maybe not so much if we learn to be self reliant again. Buy American! We've made a big step forward with becoming one of the world's largest oil producers. It's all about supply and demand.

6737 2018-04-06 23:54:21 There will be a little something in your paycheck from the oil companies, Wink wink.
6738 2018-04-06 23:54:19 Actually the main industries are now state owned. Which caused the current mess in the first place with low oil prices. 

Then why demand wealth redistribution upon others then whilst hording most of the wealth among themselves, the very proletariat they claim to attack?
6739 2018-04-06 23:54:09 Oil is the ISIS cash cow....Soros is the Dirty Dems', anti-Americans', seditionists' cash cow.
6740 2018-04-06 23:54:08 True! & type of edible seems to make a diffference & so does cannabutter vs canna coconut oil. (I should have added "vs milkfat,"  for ice cream ... which creates an excellent edible due to the fat)
& there's also the issue of how finely you grind it.
It's a learning experience!

6751 2018-04-06 23:52:25 Anything China now buys from America they can buy from Canada - except more oil, for now, anyway.
6752 2018-04-06 23:52:20 It's a good one. They cover the LaToya Gambit interview, the recent dud of an oil lease sale, the Tulane police abuses, and the unanimous verdict bill.
6753 2018-04-06 23:52:17 Justin doesn’t know how to tell the truth! He opens his mouth, he lies! It’s automatic!
The liberals have put so many down stream responsibilities on the oil industry that there is no way they can control.Libs have made it impossible for them!Then! There’s the environmentalists!
6754 2018-04-06 23:52:14 i smell canola oil 
6755 2018-04-06 23:52:07 Ah, that old chestnut. It's NOT the Scotish Governments own figures, as you very well know
1) the figures are not available or not provided from the treasury 
2) VAT is not recorded separately
3) Oil Exports are up to £27 billion adrift due to Piped / Shipped Exports

6769 2018-04-06 23:48:32 Mt 5.22 is an overlooked verse.  Elsewhere, as with Pharisees, Jesus called out religious hypocrisy, not political stance. 'Foolish' was how he described people who don't plan ahead (e.g. house on sand, foolish behind & oil).

6773 2018-04-06 23:48:02 Until Buhari spends this $1b excess crude money, he won't have a good night sleep. The good news is that it is excess crude oil money not excess groundnut or cocoa money. Which means that it is still the Old Eastern Region that keeps Nigeria functional.
6774 2018-04-06 23:47:56 I hope and pray I get a job in the oil field! So I can cop myself a ZL1 
6775 2018-04-06 23:47:34 "Mama used to burn the midnight oil, down on her knees in prayer...." 

She still does. But....like Nicole C Mullen said, you can't keep living on somebody else's angels. It's time to get your own. 

Pray. For you, for your children and great grand children...pray for the world.

6778 2018-04-06 23:47:06 You’re wrong. Keystone was proposed in 05, approved in 07 and Phase 1 to Illinois was built in 2010. Phase 3 to Gulf of Mexico was built in 2014. To date it has safely delivered over 1 billion barrels of Alberta oil to the USA. I was director at TCPL.

6783 2018-04-06 23:46:20 I can’t comprehend how anyone can defend this blatantly corrupt mobster politician who’s only focus is lining his and big oil’s pockets at taxpayers expense. Are these republican values in 2018? Really people? Really?

6800 2018-04-06 23:44:17 Alberta should pay BC a ridiculous amount of money for the 'right' to ship their oil through our Province. It's as simple as that. We will do it, but we want to be paid. Well paid. @jjhorgan @NicholasSimons @bcndp @JustinTrudeau
6801 2018-04-06 23:44:17 I am totally thrilled to know, Modi Govt turned upside down India's Economy, to touch lives of everyone.

6803 2018-04-06 23:44:10 QP has been looking for oil & gas investment in Latam for so many years already, with no success so far. However, this time I believe QP will come through in Mexico as well in Brazil. Qatar needs to position itself in the oil market and to complement its GTL future production!
6804 2018-04-06 23:44:01 I don’t understand why girls these days don’t have edges...everybody knows about Jamaican Black Castor Oil and it’s in EVERY beauty supply & drug store.
6805 2018-04-06 23:44:01 Another week has come to an end,it's FRIDAY!! As I sit back and log on to twitter, the first thing my tired tax pay eyes see..... Zoolanders goes to the oil fields for a photo op!!

6810 2018-04-06 23:43:30 @realDonaldTrump we need an EPA Secretary that will, I don't know, PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT?  You are owned by oil, coal and gas industry.  Disgusting.
6811 2018-04-06 23:43:20 They will use it to prosper and help their economy, unlike what the Federal liberals are doing to Canada with the third largest reserves in the world. Appetite for oil is growing yet Junior and Gerold are killing Canada's resource sector.
6812 2018-04-06 23:43:17 hemp seed oil you are my saviour 
6813 2018-04-06 23:43:06 Everything has to be the "biggest ever" "never seen before" "hugest grandest of all time." The snake oil salesman certainly knows his trade.
6814 2018-04-06 23:43:01 @MarkSteynOnline dust up w/ Penn St’s Michael Mann’s over his magical climate predicting tree. Then we have @RepRaulGrijalva @KamalaHarris & others using Fed & State powers to compel oil company records in similar pursuits.
6815 2018-04-06 23:42:54  I had to reread my original tweet, to make sure it didn’t have anything about oil.
6816 2018-04-06 23:42:52 He should be made to pay it all back or one of his 'billion oil buddies' can reimburse America.

6819 2018-04-06 23:42:37 Not Donnie's fault for @EPAScottPruitt being a corrupt ideologue in the pocket of oil & mining folks, it's journalists' fault for finding out and letting the public know. #Trump #Pruitt #EPA
6820 2018-04-06 23:42:31 I wonder if Trump will be asked about ties the 96 billionares in Russia that made thei money off coal, gas, oil and  gold.
6821 2018-04-06 23:42:27 Arrows with rune heads and oil soaked cloth.
6822 2018-04-06 23:42:15 wow people who live in midland are all actually assholes. lmao get over yourself you live in an oil field town not LA
6823 2018-04-06 23:42:14  I was thinking this is very struck-oil-in-your-backyard. I’m sure they didn’t know about it, and hid it to perpetuate scarcity. 
6824 2018-04-06 23:42:11 I use oil when I come across it, but mostly flower because I grow my own. 
6825 2018-04-06 23:41:25 La producción de shale oil de $YPF en febrero aumentó 12,2% i.a alcanzando los 180 MM m3/mes. La producción convencional sigue en leve caída pero menor a lo previsto y encontrando piso. En breve $YPF mostrará números positivos globales de produccion (shale y convencional).
6826 2018-04-06 23:41:14 I assume she's being paid by some coal or oil company
6827 2018-04-06 23:41:14 yeah, Shea Moisture Black soap tea tree oil and tamarind toner.
6828 2018-04-06 23:41:13 hey @BootsUK, please stop selling krill oil products which threaten the feeding grounds of whales, penguins and seals, destabilising the whole food chain in Antarctic waters

6830 2018-04-06 23:41:04 Once upon the time, Iran asked Hafez to block the iraki pipeline that goes through #Syria. Hafez said , OK but I need some compensations. Iran offered him oil at a lower cost/market and asked him to reimburse once he sells the oil. Hafez did but never gave Iran the money. 1/+
6831 2018-04-06 23:40:59 Gee why is nobody protesting car manufacturers and asphalt plants mak-up manufacturers, lubricant factories etc. You never see protesters at these places that use oil in all forms.
6832 2018-04-06 23:40:55 Instead of accidentally firing a sylladex full of steak knives into a priceless oil painting or your beloved great aunt, you can turn that fumbling fury toward one of your foes, such as the ability to grasp painfully simple concepts.
6833 2018-04-06 23:40:53 There hasn't been a single attack on him.  He's just using security to hide his corrupt deals with his oil and gas industry pay-masters.

6841 2018-04-06 23:39:45 I surprised they don't have you using oil!  it can be much stronger that smoking it.
6842 2018-04-06 23:39:41 Starting next week I will hopefully be a Doterra advocate! I will be doing reviews on each oil and product and posting them here and Facebook! If anyone is interested in any oils let me know! :) I'll be doing doodles to advertise each oil and why I like it and what it's good for!

The closest to drugs this woman has ever done is CBD oil. Forreal?

She wants me to mention that before she said cocaine I said "dick in your nose". This is our life.

6850 2018-04-06 23:38:34 I ruined a shirt with oil from alfredo pasta. Is it sad that I think it was worth it?
6851 2018-04-06 23:38:31 3. Moisturize your cuticles

Applying oil to your cuticles is a great way to ensure stronger nails. Try olive oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, and more! 

4. Let your cuticles live

Try not to push them back or cut them. Damaging your cuticles can damage your nails greatly!
6852 2018-04-06 23:38:25 Start using vitamin e oil multiple times a day now it’ll help with the stretch marks and keeping your skin nice and soft.
6853 2018-04-06 23:38:17 Far from stoopit! Lol. I was cleaning my AR15 and my hands were a bit slick from the oil. I’m highly educated though. Thanks for asking!
6854 2018-04-06 23:38:07 ada lagi ke cleansing oil?
6855 2018-04-06 23:38:00 Yeah. Just read article. N-S BC Rail routing doesn't have any oil tanker trains - mostly still wood products IIRC. BTW, this afternoon, travelling SB on 99 Fwy, saw a black behemoth oil tanker train (as far as eye could see) also heading SB over BNSF rail bridge crossing Mud Bay.
6856 2018-04-06 23:37:24 @GOP @WalshFreedom @POTUS I have all the confidence saying that EPA Pruitt is happy with Trump selecting him an Attorney for Oil Industry. Smart at the taxpayer expense spent $40,000 in Morocco last December. He is running Trump that's a final straw with US voters patience.

6862 2018-04-06 23:36:10 Dinner by myself tonight.  I bought an eggplant, looked up eggplant in How To Cook Everything, then kind of improvised off the directions.  
Cooked slices, brushed with olive oil (with a Tbsp of sesame oil and some onion powder) on a cookie sheet, under the broiler.
6863 2018-04-06 23:36:04 gelatin honey milk and oil  and she think we bout to go do something dumb with it
6864 2018-04-06 23:35:54 I was hon. Both of them!!!. So how are you feeling? Better I hope. 
6865 2018-04-06 23:35:52 Mr. Pruitt is a pawn of big oil. His appointment as EPA chief is a national and global disgrace. Save our planet. Prayers
6866 2018-04-06 23:35:44 Yep. It's all about being able to mine that sweet personal data though. That's the new oil fields.
6867 2018-04-06 23:35:35 Did Mrs B really say THC oil was dangerous 
6868 2018-04-06 23:35:29 Economy. Sebagai contoh, soal minyak. Negara Malaysia terlalu memfokuskan industry negara kepada minyak. Kebergantungan negara terhadap minyak sangatlah tinggi sebelum tahun 2014. Kesannya, 2016, bila harga crude oil jatuh.... semua oil dependent countries were greatly affected..

6875 2018-04-06 23:34:14 It's clear.  US policy has been "destabilization" not "democratization" because our oil is under their land.  (sarcasm)
6876 2018-04-06 23:34:09 Women CHOOSE not to work crazy hours in dangerous or anti-social jobs. You don't see many women tree surgeons, taxi drivers or oil rig workers. It's not society's fault- it's the 'fault' of each and every woman who freely chooses not to do these things. (1/2)

6878 2018-04-06 23:33:54 @realDonaldTrump Bad strategy to defend/praise Pruitt.  Makes you look guilty siding along w/ him, instead of Americans who supported you. There's enough going on, and your playing right into it. Everyone want clean water,  air, food, but oil& chemical industry.Balance, not greed

6886 2018-04-06 23:32:27 Dawn, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil @VictoriaPride
6887 2018-04-06 23:32:27 Well, let's see. First the earth cooled. Then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil. And then the Arabs came and they bought Mercedes Benzes. And Prince Charles started wearing all of Lady Di's clothes. I couldn't believe it.
6888 2018-04-06 23:32:26 @JimmyKimmel.  Isn’t that what rapists say?  She wanted it?  She dindt say no?  For once in your life be honest and admit that it If Sean Hannity said exactly what you said you would be leading the march with pitchforks and boiling oil.  #Libocrite

6893 2018-04-06 23:31:24 I'm of the opinion that if a Jarrell or OKC sized tornado is approaching, and you've got the time, head to your nearest quickie oil change place and head down those concrete stairs where they change the oil.

6895 2018-04-06 23:31:22 Derby beauty body lava is like 40 bucks. I’ll just use baby oil like my ancestors 
6896 2018-04-06 23:31:10 I live by @Fisticuffswax for oil, balms, and mustache wax. I have zero problems with itching or irritation, L likes how they smell, and the groom benefits are top shelf.
6897 2018-04-06 23:30:45 Sounds like OIL real life edition
6898 2018-04-06 23:30:35 Well, the oil painting is actually LEANING against the wall, since it's so heavy I can't properly hang it.  (I have to cut the support structures and redo them before I can do that.) lol
6899 2018-04-06 23:30:26 If you believe there's still a nation called Nigeria, you're either not reading the news or you're being insensitive. This land is Sold! Until the oil dries up will it dawn on us that we have nothing to be joyful about on this land.
6900 2018-04-06 23:30:26 Thank you very much  but you’re supposed to be paying attention to my gun.

6902 2018-04-06 23:30:08 I feel very strongly that the wall is connected to oil/gas/mining. Either as a way for these companies to get tax payer access and/or an excuse to invade/eminent domain these remote areas or as a threat to Mexico to be more agreeable to them.

6906 2018-04-06 23:29:50 I’m thinking since he loves oil so much get him a 1st class ticket to Saudi Arabia
6907 2018-04-06 23:29:45 right but prices will go up long befor the tariffs go into effect. problem, reaction, solution. just like when an oil refinery has a catastrophe in texas the gas prices go up that same day all over the country. its all about monetizing for profits just ask any zionist
6908 2018-04-06 23:29:33 "just found"...? Really? Like it was hidden? I can't imagine it would be that difficult to source out new oil reserves given current technology and timeline in life where we currently reside.
6909 2018-04-06 23:29:20 Almost as good as a Milwaukee cheese curd - fryer oil is too clean. Should have a hint of yesterday’s fish fry on them.
6910 2018-04-06 23:29:14 Gotta love those bribes from big oil.

6912 2018-04-06 23:29:01 Wall scrolls and my brother's Marine photos, I even have extra large oil painting I did for painting class.  I really need to get more of my stuff framed and up on my walls.
6913 2018-04-06 23:29:01 Sure, that’s why I always extinguish fire with oil!
6914 2018-04-06 23:28:57 @eleanorcurphey the last one "do you know what that is, it's oil"

6920 2018-04-06 23:28:20 Priceless. Harper & much of the heaven hitters in oil/gas either sneered at, actively undermined, or did nothing at international forums designed to reach consensus on CC mitigation. Now they say leakage means we can't act alone or boldly.
6921 2018-04-06 23:27:51 That’s not ice cream
That’s semi-frozen vegetable oil
6922 2018-04-06 23:27:48 It’s fat, also. Otherwise they’d specify “salad oil.”
6923 2018-04-06 23:27:41 We’ve tried vani cream, hydrophor, stellatopia, aveeno, AD, damn sure not Johnson’s lol, coconut oil now we  putting crisco lol

6925 2018-04-06 23:27:30 Presumably that’s the same oil business who had a report saying an oil spill would be good for the community by providing clean up employment...like a cancer unit is good for the cafes at the hospital  #Sick
6926 2018-04-06 23:27:24 Henrik Stinson looks like the mechanic at the BMW dealership that gives you the stink eye when you bring in car for oil change 1,000 over the recommended mileage
6927 2018-04-06 23:27:18 Exfoliate, face mask and facial oil. Skin feels brand new! Never thought I’d see the day where I could do all that again
6928 2018-04-06 23:27:09 oil pastels are the absolute worst medium to work with. they’re so messy and get everywhere. graphite would never treat me like this
6929 2018-04-06 23:26:52 I think I’m getting high from this essential oil diffuser.

6931 2018-04-06 23:26:22 sorry tolong jawabkan ye, mineral oil bukan tak bagus but certain people allergic & mineral oil juga boleh menyebabkan clogged pores so kalau skin awak okay just go on 
6932 2018-04-06 23:26:10 A proper and devout Orthodox will fast for the whole forty days of Lent: no meat, fish, milk, eggs or oil.

6937 2018-04-06 23:25:38 I got "Beard Guyz" oil that I use after I shower, just two drops, and I have a tin of something called "Best Damn Beard Balm" from Duke Cannon for traveling. Seriously, it made itching/dandruff disappear.

You can find tons of information about tea tree oil for hair, but how much of it is actually true? If you're unsure what's fact or fiction, read on to find out everything you need to know.
6960 2018-04-06 23:21:09 Without oil and gas you dont have most of today’s comforts. Almost everything is petroleum based or transported via trucks which use diesel. Which comes from oil. And fracing does not pollute water. Been proven and kind of common sense.
6961 2018-04-06 23:21:09 Do YOU really believe the FAKE NEWS you spit out daily? Most Americans expect both of these losers to be fired. Pruitt is costing thousands of jobs, destroying over a million acres of pristine wilderness for OIL & GAS & “P” is ruining gas mileage to sell more carbon & pollution.

6966 2018-04-06 23:20:05 .@joanjet761 I am sick of these GOP guy leaving congress & not making a difference. If you have nothing to lose than tell the truth. They say McMaster got a standing ovation from WH staff in parking lot, he's suppose to be oil & water w/45. No ovation for the HRH.

6980 2018-04-06 23:18:49 REAL NEWS: 

Globalist elite financed militant groups are destroying SA’s government & killing whites to bring civil war & regime change to a Marxist state. 

Why? To get control of the people and harvest SA’s resources (diamonds, gold, uranium, oil & much more) for themselves.

6989 2018-04-06 23:18:03 I just commented on the difference Because I've been trading the NASDAQ (because of the extreme volatility. The NASDAQ can get very crazy and is fast... the trade off is you can have large moves FAST. I tell new traders to stay on markets like E-mini S&P 500 and Crude Oil.
6990 2018-04-06 23:18:03 You’re totally wrong Marie. Keystone was proposed in 05, approved in 07 and Phase 1 to Illinois was built in 2010. Phase 3 to Gulf of Mexico was built in 2014. To date it has safely delivered over 1 billion barrels of Alberta oil to the USA. I was director at TCPL.

7001 2018-04-06 23:15:35 Try some peppermint oil on your temples, if you have some. Doesn't completely take the pain away, but should help it subside a little.
7002 2018-04-06 23:15:22 Decent chance few nations, outside of Israel, will play along. This is one of the angles the Shanghai crude mkt opens, that it can act as a clearing for Iranian oil sales.  Will be an impact, but not to the same lvl as in the past. Now, if Iran loses their shit, all bets are off.

7012 2018-04-06 23:13:30 Like clean water and air.  Like giving the oil companies more money by reducing the amount of miles a car will get per gallon.  Letting trophy killers bring in their kill and some are decreasing in numbers.  All because Obama's name was on these things that are good for America
7013 2018-04-06 23:13:22 Remove the oil and gas man and get someone who actually cares about the environment and isn’t Trump corrupt

7037 2018-04-06 23:09:45 National interest is to stop buying CDN oil in US funds,   negoiate better royalties, and make foreign investors build refineries rather then only pipelines. Governments continually give our resources away

7040 2018-04-06 23:09:40 Indeed, we agree.  The "truth worst thing" will be a Jason Kenney government and slew of silly right wing ideologues parroting whatever he tells them to parrot.  Just like under Harper at the Federal level.
And the oil and gas protests will go through the roof.

7047 2018-04-06 23:07:59 @RealDonad_Trump Record oil exports and we are getting gouged at the pumps! Why?

7050 2018-04-06 23:07:38 Why did @RepStefanik EVER support (or stay silent) about the GOP nomination and confirmation of Pruitt? I called her office before the GOP Senate confirmed this oil man to deregulate coal plant residue that leads to acid rain. Elise is slow on the uptake for ADK.

7053 2018-04-06 23:07:22 Agree on PSO; it's for the peat stations and coal which in other countries turned to solar. Renewable energy and gas are all now sub 5/6c / kWH. Oil and Gas subsidies are also in place but oversees (via tax and R&D breaks on Oil & Gas Co's).
7054 2018-04-06 23:07:17 I need an oil change.
7055 2018-04-06 23:06:55 Why the US is allied with Saudi yet demonize Russia and Iran. Saudis are allowed to get away w/ their human rights abuses b/c of OIL. They fund the most radical terrorist ISIS & AlQaeda in Syria, yet the West call Bashar a ruthless dictator for Saudis sake.
7056 2018-04-06 23:06:48 I can believe it... having Scott Pruitt over probably leaves an oil stain.
7057 2018-04-06 23:06:34 motor oil isnt for drinking
7058 2018-04-06 23:06:32 How about paying oil and gas companies massive subsidies to invest in clean energy and also not pump more.  Sort of like how the government (through the CRP program) pays farmers not to plant crops.  Not fair, but who cares at this point?
7059 2018-04-06 23:06:26 Hmm. That sounds nice. (she cubes the potatoes and when they're finished being cubed, she gets a skillet and pours oil in it to heat up)
7060 2018-04-06 23:06:17 @PressSec Pruitt has brought the EPA back to what it originally should do? Do you hear yourself? Seriously? Rolling back all kinds of protections,bowing down to big oil? What is wrong with you?
7061 2018-04-06 23:06:04 Incompetence is the way you see this when you see our Government in a positive light. However, a more cynical mind may suggest conspiracy. Especially after one learns from the past, our gov. lied about Iraq WMDs for oil in the Mid East. They could lie now also.
7062 2018-04-06 23:06:00 Indy was lost when even the most uniformed romantics gave the SNP the benefit of the doubt. Now people have seen the effect of low oil prices and falling production om our GDP the fiscal gap risk is laid bare. Most feel it a safer bet to remain in the UK and share the risk.
7063 2018-04-06 23:05:40 Midnight oil burns well.
7064 2018-04-06 23:05:38 That’s what I figured but it’s somewhat counter intuitive if growth is slowing since you’d see lower demand for using the hard asset (copper oil etc). Gold maybe better?

7070 2018-04-06 23:04:16 great point.. but i don't think either way China, Russia or Iraq or in fact Turkey will play... if ISIS can sell oil.. Iran can.
7071 2018-04-06 23:03:51 I just can’t bring myself to spend $60 on the fenty body lava bruh I love and support homegirl but I can diy with some coconut oil & old highlighter
7072 2018-04-06 23:03:50 Congrats Ethan on your start with the Oil, you are here to stay! @Edmonton oilers
7073 2018-04-06 23:03:40 They have oil deals to make & rake in billions exploiting our natural resources together. Carl Ichan recommended Pruitt for the job because he knew he’d be dirty enough and that is what Trump wants as well. What the Oligarchs did in Russia

7075 2018-04-06 23:03:20 BP claims an oil spill off Australia's coast would be a 'welcome boost' to local economies #wtf !!!
7076 2018-04-06 23:02:46 Also at odds are fuel efficiency standards.  When they are lowered, cars use more gas.  Oil is imported so trade deficit increases.
7077 2018-04-06 23:02:39 @BretBaier  Good show today.   I still@don’t think we have control of gas prices with the low oil prices.  #mastersisfavgolftournamentever
7078 2018-04-06 23:02:36 If the goals of the EPA are to sell our natural resources to oil and gas industry, poison our air, water and food, make cars less efficient, spend our money to act like a little king, then ,yeah, he's doing a great job.
7079 2018-04-06 23:02:33 Essential oil production requires low input costs. Vegetable packaging which is a secondary production. Beekeeping, mushroom production, thatch grass bayling, fish farming, etc there is more. These require fewer resources and can be done on small scale

7084 2018-04-06 23:02:17 Not that linear. Companies, to avoid confrontation/complications with USA, will support the embargo. Oil refiners are not nationally owned in Europe/Canada/SA, so will behave as it best suits their bottom line. Some Canadian companies would not deal with Cuba, even though legal.
7085 2018-04-06 23:02:04 Doesn't it smell unique when you use the avocado oil? I stopped using it cause of the amell.
7086 2018-04-06 23:02:02 Bro you have a six pack on your back howwwwwww
7087 2018-04-06 23:01:40 Well you look good lass. Liberal must be the new oil of ulay! Is it awful to notice that most leave voters our ages look really bad? Hate might actually do something to the aging process.
7088 2018-04-06 23:01:35 hmm, the big jelly bomb? Sacred lotus bath bomb? Dreamtime bath oil? Or wiccy magic muscles? 
7089 2018-04-06 23:01:29 Agreed. They've been trying to make this stuff cost effective for decades. The problem is that the province of Alberta really dependent on the oil an gas sector for their economic base. And the liberals have been shut out since Justin's dad pissed then off in the 70s.
7090 2018-04-06 23:01:22 You ever hear of John Locke. The Government has broken its contract by not governing for the masses just the elite oil industry. So Mr Locke stated since the Government has broken its contract the citizens are morally obligated to revolt. Social Studies teacher taught you
7091 2018-04-06 23:01:21 I hope the prototype get a testicular oil leak and the service genitalia soon light stays on.
7092 2018-04-06 23:00:59 Took my car to get an oil change & ended up having to change like three oils. The life of owning a vehicle 
7093 2018-04-06 23:00:58 Sage & lavendar in my oil diffuser while I blast La Chat and dip my braids to make them straight. I love being a black woman.
7094 2018-04-06 23:00:55 Serious Question Part 1: Has anyone tried Lo Bak Trax? Does it work for you? Worth picking up from @BedBathBeyond? 

Serious Question Part 2: How about Theraworx Relief? Is it similar to magnesium oil? Does it help bad foot & leg cramps?
7095 2018-04-06 23:00:54 I’m supposed to get oil for my car and go to the bank but I just wanna nap tbh

7098 2018-04-06 23:00:37 goodnight i’m gonna hope all this tea tree oil will work its magic overnight and i’ll be in less pain 
7099 2018-04-06 23:00:32 Trump needs to come before the international War Crimes Tribunal and be tried for his actions. He just doesn't get it. First he wants the US to steal the oil, now take out the family? He's just beneath any dignity!
7100 2018-04-06 23:00:29 Conservatives pissed away the Oil boom. They could have built more pipelines but chose not to. The Liberals have already approved these. Stop whining.
7101 2018-04-06 23:00:06 I think that number might be with the $3.5 Billion per year tax-breaks and subsidies Oil gets from various levels of Canadian Govts 
Luckily for them the companies are unlikely to be held to account for the clean up the toxic wasteland or the Athabaska Watershed.

7104 2018-04-06 23:00:00 That has happened to me, as well. Oddly enforced based on the whim of an officer. I was explained that the coconut oil "could become a paste"
Couldn't a lot of things "become a paste"? What about a massage bar? An orange? Perhaps candles? #wasteofgoodstuff
7105 2018-04-06 23:00:00 Blitz it with some olive oil and freeze in ice cube trays. Helps if you have too much to use fresh. Then put in a food bag. Can use it anything instead of garlic.
7106 2018-04-06 22:59:56 Did you just link to an example of a single oil pipeline leak, and then try to use that single anecdote as data showing that pipelines are more likely to leak than trains?
7107 2018-04-06 22:59:48 .@RyanZinke should be run out on a rail for his stifling LUNACY the upends America’s plans of self-sufficiency in oil production 

@FLGovScott needs to go... #SheriffIsrael debacle
7108 2018-04-06 22:59:28 that’s fake news
7109 2018-04-06 22:59:24 Funnily enough, nowhere in this article do you admit taking money from... the oil industry. Such a fake. You sold your soul years ago - what's left?
7110 2018-04-06 22:59:18 I worked too hard to look good naked for someone not to be licking the coconut oil off my body.
7111 2018-04-06 22:59:09 I said "spoken like a true user of oil" because you undoubtedly use a lot of oil, every day.

YOUR demand is what causes a need for pipelines. If you want to end the oil industry, you have to stop giving them money.
7112 2018-04-06 22:59:05 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
7113 2018-04-06 22:58:07 Bitchz wana be foreign I just want a tan  hella coconut oil and bout 100 degree weather will give me the tan I crave
7114 2018-04-06 22:58:07 Apparently I have a service plan for my car, I didn’t sign up or pay for it, but they keep doing oil changes and changing shit for free so I’m gonna roll with it.
7115 2018-04-06 22:57:56 Fresh bread, olive oil and balsamic. It doesn’t get any better.
7116 2018-04-06 22:57:49 @RobynHitchcock @rickygervais He owns oil drilling companies though so probably has a good sense of protecting the planet.
7117 2018-04-06 22:57:49 Ugh i have these oil paints i just bought and idk what to do 
7118 2018-04-06 22:57:37 What about human beings not hurting our climate? Which humans protect our climate ?  What do@we call those humans?... conservatives, liberals or just humans with common sense.......Wake up open your eyes and ears!  Are you deaf and blind? Oil = death of our@planet......
7119 2018-04-06 22:57:29 The oil industry lobbyists consistently get what they want from legislators. The power companies are very opposed to decentralized energy.
7120 2018-04-06 22:57:28 Snow crab prices and oil and gas exploration in a Federal Marine Protected Area. Two of the issues I'm discussing now with @KSullivanFFAW
7121 2018-04-06 22:57:16 Dass der Peak Oil kommt, weiß man auch in Saudi-Arabien. Oder vielleicht besonders dort.
7122 2018-04-06 22:57:02 Extremely unimpressed and embarrassed tbh with the state the @BLEACHLONDON Galixir oil has left my skin in
7123 2018-04-06 22:56:59 GOP Dirtbag. In bed with coal and oil. #firePruittnow
7124 2018-04-06 22:56:42 Wrong. I worked for TransCanada Pipelines and we got Keystone built and operating from Hardisty to Patoka, IL in 2010. It was approved by the NEB, under Harper, in September 07. It was expand to the Gulf of Mexico in 2014. It has safely delivered over a billion barrels of oil.
7125 2018-04-06 22:56:39 It literally does not move until I take it off with coconut oil. I put it on in the morning and don’t think about it again until I take it off at night. I don’t buy special removers, jus something oil based.
7126 2018-04-06 22:56:36 Ole “have yet you tried changing the oil lookin ass” 
7127 2018-04-06 22:56:06 Fantastic. I like all the lines you are showing.  Incredible too. I have a question? I just inherited a bunch of knitting needles, croquet hooks and an old Kenmore sewing machine this week.  I don't know what type of oil to use in it?
7128 2018-04-06 22:55:58 Keeping it a buck. You could just oil your body and use the highlighters you already have to make your shoulders glimmer.
7129 2018-04-06 22:55:17 Girl NO! I been dilated 4cm for 8 days  I’ve walked, walked up & down the stairs, drank castor oil! Like NOTHING is working!
7130 2018-04-06 22:55:15 Sounds now like you re talking about Oil and Coal and all minerals, Pumpkin.....

That is why they invented debt to force companies to overdeliver at prices below their total cost.  Marginal profit has been the falsehood to transfer ownership.
7131 2018-04-06 22:55:04 There's probably concerted effort against him now &rightfully so IMO. I've been watching this train wreck in motion from the beginning from a couple different POV. Not only is the Environment being hurt here but public health at risk for Oil& Gas profits. He's got to go!
7132 2018-04-06 22:54:49 Loool soyons serieux ex president bush is still free and he f**k up a all country (Irak) Weapons of massive destruction invented just to get the oil
7133 2018-04-06 22:54:29 @FoxNews @POTUS 
Now that China has surpassed the U.S. as the world’s largest oil importer, the country is seeking to end the standardization of oil trade in dollars, moving instead to the yuan. Make no mistake; this could mean death for the Petrodollar
7134 2018-04-06 22:54:27 What about “the oil of gladness”?
7135 2018-04-06 22:54:19 Lol which one is ICM oil?
7136 2018-04-06 22:54:09 Why I drink a whole bottle of castor oil 2 days ago and didn’t SHIT happen
7137 2018-04-06 22:53:57 Oil = climate change = disaster simple.........What is so hard to understand kids?
7138 2018-04-06 22:53:56 @TheVunderkind 
Don't even say anointing oil 
Thanks !!!
7139 2018-04-06 22:53:45 For $60 i better turn into lava after putting that glitter oil on @fentybeauty
7140 2018-04-06 22:52:59 It depends how much oil you eat .... also, good luck ...
7141 2018-04-06 22:52:59 Conservatives do similar things with the GOP screwing a town over by building a pipeline & 8-ish state constitutions explicitly ban atheists from holding office. As for subsidies, if you'd agree that farming/oil industries also shouldn't get subsidies, then I can level with that.
7142 2018-04-06 22:52:58 Pruitt is the oil and gas industry's chief lobbyist.
7143 2018-04-06 22:52:53 this calming lavender oil has my skin GLOWING 
7144 2018-04-06 22:52:40 so if we stopped paying Oil to drill, and coal from extracting the deadly stuff, Went to total US Citizens Owned renewables, how far the price drop then? why hell People might even get power for free. But where's your profit in that?
7145 2018-04-06 22:52:37 Spoken like a true user of a lot of oil.

If you want oil to stop coming from Alberta, you have to stop using it. Making it more difficult to transport just makes everything you buy more expensive and INCREASES the likelihood of spills.
7146 2018-04-06 22:52:32 Not a cream, but I've using coconut oil on my latest and it's been healing really nicely
7147 2018-04-06 22:52:28  Massage oil?
7148 2018-04-06 22:52:14 great!! works out pretty solid for Hinch then, gonna get a way cooler track than some of the early ones!
7149 2018-04-06 22:51:57 @realDonaldTrump Five people reported dead, followed by a declaration of a state of emergency in Indonesia following a ruptured undersea oil pipe.  Another broken pipeline - we need to stop piping oil all over the world.  We need to convert to clean energy.
7150 2018-04-06 22:51:31 They are called oil sands. There is no tar in them
7151 2018-04-06 22:51:29 Coconut oil!
7152 2018-04-06 22:51:03 That’s just not right! Is someone from the oil industry paying someone off to change or take back a conservation area/initiative
7153 2018-04-06 22:51:00 Not to mention reversing his campaign promises about the environment and opening up offshore oil & gas drilling. He was still better than the alternative.
7154 2018-04-06 22:50:40 sexy oil rig.

7156 2018-04-06 22:50:00 its a great oil painting
7157 2018-04-06 22:49:59 Olive oil will work. Just want to heat it to let the metal expand & let the oil penetrate.
7158 2018-04-06 22:49:56 3 Massages 
Breast massages will do more than help promote healthy cell growth. The benefits of breast massages include the reduction of breast cancer risk, it helps the body. It’s best to do the breast enlarging massage after a shower with a massage oil or cream.
7159 2018-04-06 22:49:49 @OriginsUKPR Hello! When will your Calm to your Senses Bath Oil be back in stock please 
7160 2018-04-06 22:49:48 It’s been 3 hours. I just came for an oil change. I should’ve learned my lesson the first time I came for a free oil change.
7161 2018-04-06 22:49:33 Irish soldiers now being sent to protect oil fields belonging to the worlds elites,welcome to the EU army,that according to FG FF does not exist.goodbye neutrality.
7162 2018-04-06 22:49:28 Ohhh, that’s being turned into a dry oil. So it won’t feel as greasy.

7164 2018-04-06 22:49:03 Funny thing is, you believe immigrants are draining the system. They are not. $700B a year on the military, huge subsidies for oil and gas, US inability to switch to #MedicareForAll. These are wasting "hard-working American" tax dollars. U R scapegoating poor and powerless
7165 2018-04-06 22:48:51 And oil rig is the ultimate natural habitat.

7173 2018-04-06 22:47:00 In all my time working with glove boxes (water & oxygen-free for my PhD work), I would be hard put to remember an aroma-free antechamber (and it wasn't just aerosolized pump oil).
That of course is ignoring the occasional oopsies involving a glove and a razor blade.
7174 2018-04-06 22:46:50 I would think a lot of the shale plays are quite profitable at $55 oil.
7175 2018-04-06 22:46:46 It's just like coconut oil
7176 2018-04-06 22:46:46 But I might try the sunflower oil you speak of.
7177 2018-04-06 22:46:46 Thanks David. So what is good for Canadians. Moving to USD or Gold or mix of it. As you said oil 10$ it's miserable trouble for CAD.
7178 2018-04-06 22:46:25 Cool, thanks for the quick and thorough response. Being that the fatty acid profile of avocado oil is so similar to olive oil, would you assume similar health benefits if one used it for cooking? I tend to only use avocado oil for any type of cooking.

7181 2018-04-06 22:45:40 I had a “friend” say that line “take the oil” I said that’s called STEALING.  Honestly, how would they feel if someone came to their house and drove off in their car?

#TrudeauMustGo
7187 2018-04-06 22:45:23 of course the fact that tarsands are the least energy efficient and most expensive form of oil extraction has nothing to do with it, because #liberallogic? or is that #cpclogic? it's really one and the same logic now that I think about it

7194 2018-04-06 22:44:34 The price of oil went lower while I was sleeping.
7195 2018-04-06 22:44:31 Fresh coffee grounds, tea tree oil and brown sugar. I swear it makes the best scrub 
7196 2018-04-06 22:44:08 Only getting on that coconut oil buzz now, but boy am I buzzed, I am so oily a cup slid out of my hand, I love smelling like a big bounty.

7202 2018-04-06 22:43:43 The PSB @NewsHour has very good report tonight on how ISIS was successful at keeping Mosul for so long. Great insight. (hint: it wasn’t oil). Should be on Youtube shortly (currently live).
7203 2018-04-06 22:43:42 The infrastructure for coal, oil and natural gas was not built by government subsidies in Western countries. The conflicts in the Middle East are ancient and deep as well as modern and some are superficial/exploited by various groups for various purposes.

7205 2018-04-06 22:43:27 Would you take on an apprentice?  I know someone who dreams of getting his hands in oil!
7206 2018-04-06 22:42:56 Not really. Peace process was going nowhere; Syria too. But on core US interests; terror against CONUS; access to oil, we're doing OK. Iran/nuclear issue, he's making a mess. But Colin, Middle East is one hot mess. And here's a news flash for you - w/HRC would have been mess too.
7207 2018-04-06 22:42:33 I have Netflix and baby oil
7208 2018-04-06 22:42:22 You still don't get it... trump has no loyalty to farmers, only big oil (RUS included).   Sorry...
7209 2018-04-06 22:42:18 If I am doing a really fast tomato sauce, its 1. Good tomatos (Glen Muir canned works well).  2.  Good olive oil  3.  A bit of garlic  4.  A pinch of crushed red pepper.   Maybe a pinch of salt.  This is really all you need.
7210 2018-04-06 22:42:17 USA will be the biggest oil country. Why produce more oil? It is not neded.
7211 2018-04-06 22:42:09 Are you referring to the actual voters values or the oil companies that line your pockets along with the NRA.  Your personal worth must be flush with cash after all of that and tax cuts too.  
7212 2018-04-06 22:42:09 I typically sauté on medium to medium high heat, I think that's safe to do with olive oil. 

If stovetop setting is high or baking above 350F I try and keep something like high oleic sunflower oil around to use. I've also used avocado oil but the flavor isn't my favorite.

7221 2018-04-06 22:40:21 I'm so sick of this.  There's no excuse for off shore oil, pipelines going thru native american tribal lands, flint, Michigan. Photos of the trumps killing elephants. There's no excuse. It cant go on. Pruitt. Perry, Zinke Mnuchin. Disgusting.

He also had d bullet proof desk made for his secretary..  at tax payer expense. 

And a $30k sound proof booth for his office. 

And a $100k trip to MOROCCO to DO some gas & oil lobbying while he is head of EPA. A DOMESTIC ENVOROMWNRAL AGENCY!

7238 2018-04-06 22:37:24 Soo linseed oil pala talaga ang ginagamit sa oil paint. Hmm should buy one kase based sa nabasa kong research online, ginagamit talaga s'ya as medium sa painting. Okayy kk hahhaha
7239 2018-04-06 22:37:24 Not just pep though. You’re about to win your third title under your third manager. After years of under achieving before the oil money.
7240 2018-04-06 22:37:18 I can't use oil as i am allergic to formulin that is natural preservative in oil. That looks like it may be a little infected from the picture. They are awful on knuckles because every bend opens them up, so sore. Hope you can get some relief very soon xx
7241 2018-04-06 22:37:05 As an Oklahoman living with the fallout of his tax breaks for oil, I’d prefer a nice gauntlet for him. I’ll bring the rotten veggies. #FireScottPruitt #oklaedwalkout
7242 2018-04-06 22:36:47 With all respect sir, it seems you don't know TY's contribution to the crises he was crying talking about. Anyway ask anyone you know from #Taraba state would tell you better. Am sorry but @cbngov_akin1 is right. They are fighting for their oil Wells nothing more.
7243 2018-04-06 22:36:38 Don’t forget Russia is oil hungry. They’d love Zinke to open all our resources for oil exploration. I’m sure that’s why Redon was there. ESP. The rich untouched arctic. See the dossier!

7252 2018-04-06 22:35:03 The oil companies only produce the oil. They certainly aren't end users. It takes a  seriously left leaner to try taxing a corporation for selling product to willing buyers. Typical lefty. Blame everyone else but those responsible.
7253 2018-04-06 22:34:49 Ya’ll be out here sending ashy ass dick pics like bro put some coconut oil on that bitch

7258 2018-04-06 22:33:56 To bad the east likes to support foreign oil rather than our own. How much of Dubia was built by our imports. How many first nation are living in substandard housing. Access to clean water.  How many people have to deficate in a 5 gallon pail and pack it out of there homes!
7259 2018-04-06 22:33:53 Sorry I had to end the stream quick tonight, the return to the furnace is clogged which caused the bang I heard and the house to fill up and smell like smoke / oil. Getting it fixed tonight I hope. Stream tomorrow I'm hoping.

7264 2018-04-06 22:32:42 America has resources, esp. the rich arctic. Ever hungry for more oil sources, putin wants what Zinke is busy preparing for him

7271 2018-04-06 22:31:10 @SenatorIsakson How can you keep Pruitt as the head of the EPA? He is spending the tax payers money, he works for us, not the oil companies, nor lobbyists. The lack of ethics is appalling. Do your job!

A couple weekends ago sarah palin was a friend who helped him want to drill baby drill
7343 2018-04-06 22:20:59 got this hair product with sunflower oil in it
7344 2018-04-06 22:20:59 Was it oil or all ? 
7345 2018-04-06 22:20:52 Argan oil smells so bomb
7346 2018-04-06 22:20:52 What do you mean by "oil and gas investment"?
7347 2018-04-06 22:20:36 It’s so simple. Just baby oil and highlight powder lol. Apparently there are YouTube videos. They were out before her product came out
7348 2018-04-06 22:20:33 I’m mad someone convinced me to get synthetic oil in my car now I really gotta get it every time.
7349 2018-04-06 22:20:27 It'll have to burn like the kuwait oil fires to get her skinny
7350 2018-04-06 22:20:26 Thanks. A lot of great info on this podcast. You mentioned cooking your veggies in olive oil in the am. Do you have any concerns about olive oil’s low smoke point? Any evidence this is less than ideal for health?
7351 2018-04-06 22:20:18 Fun behind the scenes stuff: Kris would drop his pants all the time and Paul would hot pepper sauce/oil people's stuff all the time. Luke, who played Dyson's son, actually had an allergic reaction, which they totally didn't  plan #LostGirl #ClexaCon2018
7352 2018-04-06 22:20:15 YouTuber's review of #DoctorWho The End of Time claims it had record low ratings that almost led to the show's cancellation. Fails to mention how TEOT caused the BP oil spill and killed David Bowie.
7353 2018-04-06 22:20:13 I fear your looking for the balls and not finding any. The EU right now is funding Turkey's accession to the tune of billions. In other news Turkish warships, right now, are blocking an EU member, Cyprus's, rights to drill for oil in its EEZ. The EU is doing nothing about this.
7354 2018-04-06 22:19:53 tea tree oil! just use a small dab on your blemish & it will be dried up! you don’t use a whole lot though.
7355 2018-04-06 22:19:30 #tytlive Remember when Bush "acted" tough with Sadam... Thousands men, women, and children perished in a war fought over oil and old vendettas.
7356 2018-04-06 22:19:09 Yes, mom cleans counter off too well now, so no leftovers...ever since the licking the olive oil out of the frying pan incident!!   MOL

7359 2018-04-06 22:18:55 Can someone more knowledgeable explain Keto to me like obviously the cutting carbs is good but all the fat and oil seem like it would make your cholesterol sky rocket... also wouldn’t all the calories prevent your body from tapping into the fat stores already there?
7360 2018-04-06 22:18:39 i avoid anything coconut oil. that shit is devil’s spawn
7361 2018-04-06 22:18:24 So, when is the oil headed east?  Oh yes, it’s all support going west but headed east it doesn’t work for them...  thanks Justin. But first, let me take a selfie...
7362 2018-04-06 22:17:58 I need a tune up and a oil change 
7363 2018-04-06 22:17:46 1/ On drilling & transporting #oil: It's not IF a rig, pipeline, ship or train will spill or leak, it's WHEN. Consider this when reading today's #oilspill headlines: Supporting #altfuels today will reduce our need 4 oil & subsequently the frequency & size of spills & leaks THREAD
7364 2018-04-06 22:17:46 coconut oil clogs pores
7365 2018-04-06 22:17:37 @KrazyEssentials makes a body oil that you could get several of for the price of just one.
7366 2018-04-06 22:17:36 Truth, right there.
7367 2018-04-06 22:17:10 The Anthropocene, population explosion, corruption, religion, war for oil, what do you expect? Much time left to act with reason? Or even to figure out what reason actually is for all the human beings involved?
7368 2018-04-06 22:16:53 You have to be careful when putting it in the oven; make sure the broccoli is well covered in olive oil so it doesn't dry out; you can also do this with carrots if you don't like broccoli.
7369 2018-04-06 22:16:48 When Alberta was flush with oil and the petro-dollars were flowing in, it was “It’s OUR oil, and Ottawa better leave us alone.” Basically, you told the other provinces to pound sand. 
Now it’s “wah-wah...when does Ottawa have our backs?” 
Nice!
7370 2018-04-06 22:16:44 I've got mine a Lil j's smoke shop in fairview hieght. I'd bet you could find it on Cherokee street pretty easy. And online just Google cbd oil. They have candy, vape pens all kinds of stuff
7371 2018-04-06 22:16:41 The G7 meeting declared oil a lethal danger to mankind today. Late #AprilFools

7374 2018-04-06 22:16:27 at what age am I supposed to stop being terrified of adults and finally feel comfortable enough to make my own doctors appointments and get an oil change all by myself without crying???
7375 2018-04-06 22:16:17 Trump promised to end the oil age "within a year" and suspend all plans of drilling and fracking and similar today. Late #AprilFools

7377 2018-04-06 22:16:11 what about oil cleansing for my midday or is that too much since i’ll be doing it at night also?
7378 2018-04-06 22:16:00 Don't forget to paint it with oil. Olive, canola, it doesn't really matter. It does something wonderful to the flavor. It takes you to Flavortown.
7379 2018-04-06 22:15:53 People of AZ happy they only have 1/2 representation in Senate they are entitled to  and the only one there is really a Dem?
7380 2018-04-06 22:15:49 Is it safe to take meds by hand if you have a little gun oil on your hands? Asking for a friend.
7381 2018-04-06 22:15:39 Turned it into b&w to hide the oil.
7382 2018-04-06 22:15:29 EZ shares -0.5% (+1.1% for wk), US shares -2.1% (-1.4% wk) as Trumps consideration of more China tariffs ramps up trade war fears again. US 10 yr yld -6bp (+3bp wk).

7393 2018-04-06 22:13:44 Try some grapeseed oil, its very light, not too greasy. It's also great as a beard oil or a before shaving skin treatment.

7397 2018-04-06 22:13:14 Are you kidding me, he’s out to undermine or eliminate every rule there is protecting the environment.    His goal is to have everyone drink oil, breath carbon dioxide, and eat coal, for those of us that can’t or can’t afford to purchase the real stuff we’ll join the extinct.
7398 2018-04-06 22:13:10 I really like Donna Jean’s reply, because we do go to their countries and change their rules, and rulers, based on who is friendliest to our oil interests. We’ve been removing and installing rulers in Middle Eastern countries since WW2.
7399 2018-04-06 22:13:08 No I bloody well do not!  If he was the Miracle man he would be a leader in solar and green alternate technology and Canada would be a light unto the world not a dirty oil petro state hooked to the past
7400 2018-04-06 22:13:00 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO IDENTIFY? #yeg #agchat #MedEd #science #Detective

7402 2018-04-06 22:12:41 What a topsy-turvy day this has been. Some niggling embuggerances, chiefest of which was seeing oil puddling under the blade  however, a trip to my local hero and two hours spent lying on his driveway renewing the oil and filter has me back on an even keel!

7405 2018-04-06 22:12:27 I thought wearing a jumpsuit would be fun, but I had to get an oil change and now I have to pee. So I'm trying to summon the courage to be essentially naked in a #jiffylube bathroom. #fashionfails #jumpsuitfails #wardrobemalfunction #ilookcutethough #FML
7406 2018-04-06 22:12:12 I shopped a sweet little mini of love oil off today. Hopeful she can open it when it get there. It's wrapped up tight.

7409 2018-04-06 22:11:32 I understand but this is hurting our state. That is the problem. Big oil, wind, hotels, and now AG do not want to step up and all pay an equitable share to get our State out of this mess. Heaven forbid you see a little less profit.

7412 2018-04-06 22:10:16 One tweet about essential oil farts and the freaks start coming out of the woodwork.

7414 2018-04-06 22:10:02 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
7415 2018-04-06 22:09:54 Read the damn article, it's a tool to compare temperatures across time and place, not a prediction. Pull your head out of Big Oil's ass.
7416 2018-04-06 22:09:53 Lol!!!girl I've never heard of the sight of meat making a pregnant woman  nauseous but every woman is different I remember frying some fried chicken with my second pregnancy and the smell of the oil made me sick as a dog, I was in my first trimester but I could still eat meat.

7420 2018-04-06 22:09:13 Trump mocked a man with disabilities & yet #DougFord says he'd vote for Trump in a heartbeat. What dinosaurs! You're right, we endured Harris austerity & continue to suffer its ill effects in our schools. We don't need more ill-informed know-nothings selling us snake oil remedies
7421 2018-04-06 22:08:58 Your fake news rhetoric doesn't apply here and is more appreciated in the United States. Oil is dying, renewable energy is on the rise, and the environment is changing for the worse. YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE TRUTH

7425 2018-04-06 22:08:20 I've started using Cbd oil it works wonders for way better and safer than pain meds. I'd give it a try works wonders
7426 2018-04-06 22:07:43 Whoopsie... did Pat forget his mic was on again? Poor guy, he needs to know that what he does with a group of young, muscle-y men and copious amounts of baby oil in his free time is totally OK these days.

7435 2018-04-06 22:06:21 I also wonder. But I think in this discussion we should distinguish the content of the tax reform (the level of the tax increase) and the form (a rushed politicized process with limited consultation). Although people may debate on the former, few would defend the latter.
7436 2018-04-06 22:06:06 Realtor: in fact after we dug up the Indian burial ground, we decided to put oil pipelines right through it for the f*** of it. 
7437 2018-04-06 22:05:51 I stopped washing my face and started using argan oil on it and haven’t broken out since ????

7439 2018-04-06 22:05:38 Good point. How do you define toxic? 
 
Wiki def:
Toxicity: degree to which a chemical substance, or a particular mixture of, can damage an organism.

By this def,
too much water can be toxic...
as could the SLS in my shampoo...
as could putting lavender oil in my eyeballs.
7440 2018-04-06 22:05:36 Thank you; you just made this old lady smile!
7441 2018-04-06 22:05:36 @BootsUK please can you stop using krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. #ProtectAntarctic
7442 2018-04-06 22:05:26 i put rosemary, tea tree, peppermint, & black castor oil on my scalp & it feels amazing.
7443 2018-04-06 22:05:20 Plus China has been trying to make the Yuan the major currency in the trade of oil. 

Americans are fucking idiots, they give technology, education, money to China for free, have a massive trade deficit with China and expect Trump, a business man, to do nothing about it.

7446 2018-04-06 22:04:54 That would be the first time this government has expressed support for the oil sands.
7447 2018-04-06 22:04:51 you could take it a step further and make your own skincare out of natural products like egg whites, honey, clay, aloe, coconut oil, etc. and stop buying overpriced products
7448 2018-04-06 22:04:42 Yes I have. I went right down the line.

7450 2018-04-06 22:04:36 To bad I thought the rigs would look cool next to the wind turbines. Was going to start a business giving boat tours out the oil and wind rigs
7451 2018-04-06 22:03:59 It’s all fun and games driving to Santa Cruz in the rain until you pass a flipped truck on the 17 and hydroplane off the spilled oil immediately after that 
7452 2018-04-06 22:03:49 It's obvious oil had to go some where. #PMJT picked one of 4 options..

7454 2018-04-06 22:03:39 I’m sincerely unsure. If they come from illegal refineries, then they should be sealed up. But oil money aka blood money is tempting and other humans will rather have people die slowly while they get rich.

7468 2018-04-06 22:02:19 Is @BootsUK still intent on filling its boots at the expense of the whales and other Antarctic wildlife? Time to ditch krill oil products and protect the Antarctic. #ProtectAntarctic

7471 2018-04-06 22:01:53 My brother and I are having an honest conversation and he just reminded me of the saying that says; “Like oil from water, the people who don't belong in your life will eventually drift away from you, as you rise...”

7473 2018-04-06 22:01:47 Last night I put coconut oil serum in my hair and I genuinely can’t believe the difference today. It’s so soft and feels in a lot better condition already 
7474 2018-04-06 22:01:42 He's been doing since back in Atlantic City days. The guy is a snake oil salesmen. He may have the title of President but I wouldn't give him the time of day if he was standing in front of me... He is such a joke...
7475 2018-04-06 22:01:41 You're holding a shotgun?

I hadn't noticed...
7476 2018-04-06 22:01:39 My point was that a President targeted an entire industry. Research what others prior have done..from Oil, to Airlines  Transport, Wall Street..same old song. Trump’s no diff with his megaphone!

7480 2018-04-06 22:01:24 I'm all for the communication of innovation and spreading the word but Hanson Robotics are actually selling snake oil claiming this is the most advanced AI (FACT: Dr Hanson worked at Disney before making his own robots!)
7481 2018-04-06 22:01:19 Oops I meant the bath and body oil. I really like the old one's consistency. It's thin enough to be layered and thick enough for use on it's own. Hoping there's a better version in the works 
7482 2018-04-06 22:01:06 I'm about to switch to. The almond oil is magical.

7485 2018-04-06 22:00:44 WHY doesn't this information along with the Haiti oil thievery from the Clinton's make more news?? WHY? People are so ignorant to think the Clinton's are anything other than self serving megalomaniacs who became SUPER wealthy on the backs of US.. U.S. CITIZENS & the poor Haitians

7488 2018-04-06 22:00:27 Your sexist bias is showing. I wasnt suggesting women clean toilets in the oil field, I was suggesting they start getting tickets to operate equipment or act as derricks.
7489 2018-04-06 22:00:16 And they won't go after oil, gas, the top percenters. They're blaming the tribes, literally saying they aren't "getting enough" from us when what they did was took what we put in, turned around doubled tax breaks. Racist scapegoating fucks.
7490 2018-04-06 22:00:10 How lovely! I would adore using an essential oil candle. Favorite scent.....RANGE for this family! Great health properties! Love to start my Spring off on a healthy foot.

7496 2018-04-06 21:59:36 Oh come on, you could find dozens of flunkies to advance your EPA agenda who aren't guilty of a dozen or so major ethics violations! Choose anyone from the oil industry and they'd be happy to do it. 

You don't need Pruitt to fuck up the environment.

New tires on everything? 
Fresh grease? 
Oil change? 

I just wanna sit down and take a nap
7502 2018-04-06 21:59:04 There are also a lot other countries on the loopy list. So what? 
And there are American anti oil lobbyists as well on the list.
Not sure what your point is.

7508 2018-04-06 21:58:26 You want hot oil to burn you.

7519 2018-04-06 21:57:43 tip 1:
castor oil-
put the castor oil on a q-tip or a cotton ball and apply to your lash line. repeat this once everyday.

tip 2:
coconut oil-
put it on a cotton ball or q-tip and apply to lash line. repeat once everyday.
7520 2018-04-06 21:57:40 So putting more oiltankers in the water is protecting our coast or protecting oil business

7524 2018-04-06 21:56:55 omg noooo  just get the beauty blender you can buy the same body oil at bath & body works for like $13-$16
7525 2018-04-06 21:56:53 No, not the story I'm hearing. The MSM is pointing out how big oil and polluters put you in office so now in return, Pruitt dismantled the EPA. Now he spends taxpayer money for his office and accepts favors from lobbyists.
7526 2018-04-06 21:56:44 I can use the new Shea moisture plain amla oil as a skin treatment, on my face neck, boobs and eyelashes #supportblackbusinesses I like their other items too, body washes, they just came out with lip balms
7527 2018-04-06 21:56:44 ....In no way does she try to disprove climate change in this video. She straight up says that “energy independence (of America) is a beautiful thing” and that industry workers would be the ones suffering if oil fracking wasn’t allowed. You waste bandwidth everyday Tomi.
7528 2018-04-06 21:56:42 Who cares.  Sarah The Sneer should probably be a huge draw.  Tums oil every table!
7529 2018-04-06 21:56:35 Nobody did

7536 2018-04-06 21:55:52 I see. So it's like a really hot blow dryer with a little oil mister built in. Yes, this seems like a different appliance. Thank you for finding the answer to one of today's life's great mysteries.
7537 2018-04-06 21:55:31 Use our own oil in refineries built in Alberta an Canada to give Albertans and Canadians affordable gasoline. Then sell off excess and don't import back oil and gasoline at grossly inflated prices!
7538 2018-04-06 21:55:16 Wow. Incredible. If ever need an oil masseuse. 
7539 2018-04-06 21:55:07 when i see girls putting so much money into makeup remover when olive oil is the best thing you could use
it removes ALL makeup, even waterproof
it's cheap AF
it's safe to remove eye makeup with
it moisturizes the skin
it's natural
7540 2018-04-06 21:55:05 My #chevyequinox @MacHaikChevy14 @HoodChevy had a serious oil consumption problem for the last 5 years. I have an email from the service mgr. Where I bought my car that Chet is aware of this problem about that type of engine they put in the Equinox.
7541 2018-04-06 21:54:47 The Baby Facial ($80) and the oil that goes with it ($75?) you gotta buy it together. Mudda expensive and use it once a week
7542 2018-04-06 21:54:34 So no injures on the devils this year? They had a better team? They had no holes on thier roster? By that theroy the golden knights should be last place they used 7 goalies this year. All im saying is what does Hall have in new jersey? Compared to what he had in edmonton?
7543 2018-04-06 21:54:27 On this oil feeling like fuck it

7545 2018-04-06 21:54:19 I'm sure tons of 'big oil' money flowed into Trumps campaign. That's why Pruitt is there. To make their rich dirty oil friends richer. He won't fire him.

7560 2018-04-06 21:52:29 I’m trying to help you. Come thru. I’ll rub some peppermint oil on ya temples.
7561 2018-04-06 21:52:12 Zinke too! He is clearly on the side of oil/gas corps. Money speaks louder than preserving wilderness & sacred lands for future generations. We not only stand to lose our wild areas but also a natural land base essential to understanding the impacts of anthropogenic activities.
7562 2018-04-06 21:52:11 Injury & what was still a roster w/ many holes derailed that season. So by using that logic I guess you are not a fan of McDavid. After all, the Oilers are among the worst teams in the league. You can't have it both ways.
7563 2018-04-06 21:52:09 @billburr was Ladondo MaGravey at the concert? Heard he was blowing his signing bonus with the New Rochelle Oil Sprockets on hookers and coke. Am I twittering right? Haven't been on it in 4 years.
7564 2018-04-06 21:51:43 No oil, all water. Truck has been sitting basically for almost 2 years. In shop now for an airbag, couple oil leaks. Was just serviced in October with all new filters because they were going to put it back in service but then we wanted it.
7565 2018-04-06 21:51:32 He BS and sold snake oil and many Fools bought it. SAD choke on some smog and drink dirty water Lisa
7566 2018-04-06 21:51:30 @ForkReporter Have you heard about how @pennjillette lost tons of weight with @RayCronise "diet"? Super interesting and probably saved, or at least prolonged, Penn's life. Basically eat mostly plants with no added oil or salt and every once in a while, feast on whatever you want.
7567 2018-04-06 21:51:28 Do you or someone you love suffer from pain or discomfort in your life? 
Have you tried CBD Oil?

7568 2018-04-06 21:51:16 Bubba trending reminds me of when a bloke walked up to me in a Liverpool pub and said he wanted to smear me in baby oil and call me Bubba. Never drank my  so quickly before or since. 
7569 2018-04-06 21:51:12 Interesting. Does the air fryer apply the oil? If not, why do I need a different kind of oven? (Sorry. I hadn't heard of an air fryer until today, and I am genuinely confused and curious.)
7570 2018-04-06 21:51:11 ok i'll allow pan roasted brussel sprouts with a little olive oil and Parmesan cheese. and i'll get pizza with extra gluten so no one is wasting gluten.
7571 2018-04-06 21:51:06 I used it to clean the driveway oil stains 
7572 2018-04-06 21:51:05 Most of them are paid bots, and the rest follow just to see what nonsense trump will tweet out next. Only a small population are real trump supporters. Most don't fall for a snake oil salesman like trump, the proverbial con man.
7573 2018-04-06 21:50:58 Went back a looked at the report I got a month ago. Was looking at soy oil. There are several soy protects broken down. Soybeans are processed quite a bit. You can't feed beans to animals without cooking them. It's the main source of protein in most feeds but I don't like it.
7574 2018-04-06 21:50:33 يقصد اينما وجد النفط تواجد الامريكان

ما ادري اذا وصلت الفكرة !!
7575 2018-04-06 21:50:32 We're talking abt gas pipelines pls. It's easily tapped to metered off-takers anywhere along its route thus catalyzing growth anywhere. That's different from oil pipelines that are constructed with a particular destination in mind thus serving less economic benefit on its way
7576 2018-04-06 21:50:05 According to the wikipedia article on air frying the fries are coated with a thin layer of oil and then baked. I think that's still baking, and the oil is serving as a maillard reaction to brown in a way that is like frying but not really frying.
7577 2018-04-06 21:50:05 Because russia got no oil and dont buy our weapons thats why 
Saudi buy our military weapons and trade oil 
Its huge currency

7587 2018-04-06 21:48:40 Effective?? HAHA. He's totally corrupt! Although, that's a job requirement for the Trump regime. And his anti-environment policies let his Big Oil cronies foul our air and water (although I hear that right-wingers believe they don't need clean water or air).

7589 2018-04-06 21:48:29 Brian cage ......  but yeah there’s no more Ahmed Johnson’s. He literally pour d baby oil on himself on the way through the curtain 
7590 2018-04-06 21:48:27 No, me either. But no, the oven one is not frying - the oil isn't what's conducting the heat. In the case of a fried egg, it is. I think that just as steaming something conveys heat with steam, frying conveys heat with oil.
7591 2018-04-06 21:48:24 Uhh i like my fresh water and wildlife...oil spilld and pollution are bad
7592 2018-04-06 21:48:22 Edge control, Cocoa butter and coconut oil my favourite fragrance on you. 
7593 2018-04-06 21:48:12 This is a lot easier to do when these chemicals are produced environmentally in situ, hence paleontological profiling and dating of crude oil etc.. but when the precursors and solvents come from widely traded, exported and imported..
7594 2018-04-06 21:48:09 If you could buy pure CBD oil from the comfort of you home with a money back guarantee would you?

7596 2018-04-06 21:47:55 jaemin should probably get renjun to translate to chenle that he needs his oil checked
7597 2018-04-06 21:47:50 girrrl! Aztec healing clay mask with apple cider vinegar twice a week, rose water with witch hazel spray twice a day every day! and tea tree oil for breakouts 
7598 2018-04-06 21:47:48 The US used depleted uranium in Serbia, phosphorus bombs in the ME, invaded Syria and continues to stay in the Iraq & Afghanistan making billions on oil, over-priced construction and selling outdated weapons to the puppet governments. Russia looks brilliant compared to the West.
7599 2018-04-06 21:47:46 Would CBD oil be one of the options for you? We can talk.
#cindenintegrativehealth #cindennutritionals
7600 2018-04-06 21:47:30 Yes we have burned a lot of coal and oil. Interesting though the global temperatures have changed by how much? Oh less than 1 degree in over 100 years. Was that human caused or natural earth changes?
7601 2018-04-06 21:47:14 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
7602 2018-04-06 21:47:12 Interesting article and true that many terrorists and Jihadis are Sunni moslem but it forgets  & ,  &  in the equation & their antagonism with  not to mention the revolution in  by King Salman! It’s not only about oil & there’s the nukes also to consider
7603 2018-04-06 21:46:59 Oh....thats what's happening! 
This makes the others make more sense.
Sad I don't know any kiwi, so here's a bit of northern English on my way out:

Put th'wud in th'oil!
(Phonetic )
7604 2018-04-06 21:46:56 Peel it.. sometimed the skin is bitter
Flour, egg bath, bread crumbs, FRY
Or just cube it ,& cook with garlic & oil over spaghetti.. ( yes, I'm italian)
7605 2018-04-06 21:46:55 I guess then it's a matter of immersion? If you were to brush something with oil and bake it, are you frying it? You can fry stuff in a pan with a shallow bit of oil, too. I don't think I'm getting anywhere with this.

7607 2018-04-06 21:46:47 I go for an oil change and now they saying my car got cancer and I’ll need to pay $600. Not today Satan
7608 2018-04-06 21:46:26 Wrong again.  We need to stop putting carbon into the air.

So tell me, are you somehow involved in the fossil fuel industry?  You appear to be an oil protectionist.
7609 2018-04-06 21:46:22 Cannabis oil

7611 2018-04-06 21:46:17 I made a salad and instead of heaping a cup of ranch dressing on it, I used olive oil with a pinch of salt. So basically I’m the epitome of health and wellness, come to me for tips on how to achieve that summer bod.
7612 2018-04-06 21:46:09 He's lying. Farmers can't get their wheat to market because oil trains are ramping up the low cost oil export; our GDP is tanking b/c of preferential treatment given to oil subsidies against economy offarmer's landowners fisheries tourism.

7616 2018-04-06 21:45:59 You analyze the temperature of the hot oil before dipping the fry basket? Does it confuse you when a customer wants to super size their order?
7617 2018-04-06 21:45:35 That's not true. Teddy had to die before they evolved. The whole time he was alive they were in full denial.
7618 2018-04-06 21:45:11 well i just lost fuckton of camphor oil because i didnt clean the filter properly and it started bubbling from soap literally everywhere and i had to clean it again
7619 2018-04-06 21:44:50 yeah, i tried bio oil and it did nothing for me
7620 2018-04-06 21:44:48 @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic 
I am disappointed to hear that Boots is still stocking krill oil products sourced from the feeding grounds of whales and penguins. When will you follow in the footsteps of Holland & Barrett, Superdrug and Morrisons and take a stand against it.
7621 2018-04-06 21:44:28 Is the greasy hair look some guys do also baby oil?
7622 2018-04-06 21:44:26 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
7623 2018-04-06 21:44:22 I'm just like... Like, I could call a deep fryer an "oil boiler" but the food would still come out fried. I thought that frying relied on cooking something in oil. To paraphrase Bob Marley, no oil no fry.
7624 2018-04-06 21:44:16 Yuan for oil is a go
7625 2018-04-06 21:44:05 It was a mistake but super simple. Lmao I just boiled both separately until they were like 3 minutes from done. Put some oil in a pan with garlic and onions. Then out the potatoes and cauliflower in. Used my regular seasonings and added curry powder.
7626 2018-04-06 21:43:51 Much better analogy. Oil unrefined isn't all that useful. #CFD3
7627 2018-04-06 21:43:39 Truffle oil. Clearly the lube of the gods.

7632 2018-04-06 21:42:48 Sorry to hear one of your favorites was discontinued, Holly! We hope you can forgive us and give our Fiery Thai almond oil chips a try?
7633 2018-04-06 21:42:46 Good point. I was thinking of the overall trajectory of judgments, and particularly the language evolving from transexual to gender identity. Like an oil tanker, it's going to be hard to turn around!
7634 2018-04-06 21:42:44 Do you remember the cinnamon tooth picks, the ones for smokers. Use to buy cinnamon oil for cooking and made my own. Damn stuff was concentrated so much it would cause burns, so I diluted it with vodka 
7635 2018-04-06 21:42:41 Hi I just saw your email about products being discontinued. Towards the end you mentioned new products will be replacing many of them with better versions. Will there be a better version of the body oil?
7636 2018-04-06 21:42:23 Christians should be wary of so-called Christians candidates who call themselves Evangelicals,  which is most often a code word for racism, snake oil salesmen with their pyramid schemes & a zealotry worthy of fascists and dictators. They often support authoritarian politicians.

7640 2018-04-06 21:41:24 People don't vote green probably due to "environmental bankruptcy". You can't offer Canadians government programs without increased oil production in Alberta. And you can't go electric without being aware of mining practices elsewhere that may be comparatively hazardous and bad.

7645 2018-04-06 21:40:42 See who owns our oil wells
7646 2018-04-06 21:40:40 The  currency we have today is a fiat. Our currency has no standard. The Fed can print as much currency they want to bc all oil in the world must be purchased with dollars. As long as their sucking oil out of the ground they can print as many dollars as they want.

7654 2018-04-06 21:39:59 That's Exactly WHY Pruitt was chosen… To Dismantle Environmental Protections & Deregulate the Oil, Gas & Coal Industries. He Also decided to lavish himself & his corrupt cronies with Taxpayer funded travel, $43,000 soundproof office phone booth & $50,000 Raises for his aides!

7656 2018-04-06 21:39:15 So 5-6 wins shy of where Oil will finish the year.

When I consider the lengthy list that comprises the “death by a thousand cuts” season, many entries on that list are highly unlikely to repeat themselves next season, I do consider this to be “a step back” season!

7658 2018-04-06 21:38:39 Sure, that’s why coal and oil and gas are SO fond of Pruitt, he protects the environment from them... oops, Never mind!

You know, libertarians.

7758 2018-04-06 21:23:24 The government really does disgust me....I'll be working at 80 at this rate and nobody will give a damn after working my whole life around oil patch and then trucking ....investments be damned...liars and crooks all of them without souls
7759 2018-04-06 21:23:14 Leeteuk asking arab fans to give him oil lmao i hate him
7760 2018-04-06 21:23:13 I need an oil change but im working mon-Saturday for the next two weeks and mechanics are closed on sunday 1 like= 1 prayer
7761 2018-04-06 21:23:10 Baby Oil.......in BULK!
7762 2018-04-06 21:23:10 How can you sit there and spew near facts YOUR government did not get any pipeline approved taking Alberta oil to world markets in fact in that area #Harper and you were a unmitigated disaster AND you were supposed to be there for Albertans given the loyal conservative support!
7763 2018-04-06 21:23:06 “The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon”
7764 2018-04-06 21:22:59 getting my oil changed and brakes now too but I was kind of expecting that...now these mfs say I need tires again. fuck that I don't need tires...I need a sugar daddy.
7765 2018-04-06 21:22:47 I will recommend first a peaceful march to create awareness to inform the public especially the rural dweller of the negative impact of soot so they can join the struggle to stop this inhuman act by oil companies.
7766 2018-04-06 21:22:36 S&P closed -2%, DAX -0.5%.

Barnes & Noble +4%; Tesla & Microsoft -2%, Visa & Micron & Apple -3%, Macy’s & AMD -4%, Daimler & US Steel -6%.

Vix + 13%, Libor 2.32%, Oil -2.5% to $61.95/bbl.

That’s it for the week.
7767 2018-04-06 21:22:26 Clinique's Beyond Perfecting Foundation & Concealer will actually absorb the excess oil on your skin. It's got pretty great science behind it.
7768 2018-04-06 21:22:25 Yeah, I went right down the line. If James Woods had made a similar tweet, his acct would be suspended in under 2 minutes. Guaranteed.
7769 2018-04-06 21:22:23 Oh yeah oh yeah and do you know what that is.... oil 
7770 2018-04-06 21:22:22 Republicans Oil money democrats feed off the government teets...
7771 2018-04-06 21:22:10 Thanks Jimboman for the data you share, much appreciated. Have a good weekend!
7772 2018-04-06 21:21:52 Bet he got a cushy oil & gas job to land in.
7773 2018-04-06 21:21:50 All the Trumpian yada yada yada about how Pruitt is so terrific. Then why is he so screwed up? How does he operate from the pocket of Big Oil? Why is Trump protecting him? Boot Him Out.

7775 2018-04-06 21:21:42 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
7776 2018-04-06 21:21:41 Jiffy Lube also gave me the wrong air filter and I was already on the freeway here in LA. The oil was all over my engine and my car survived the trip back home. I went to the one near me and they redid everything for free and were sorry for the other locations mistake.
7777 2018-04-06 21:21:13 Olive oil can lays claim to $150 million lol lol.
7778 2018-04-06 21:21:08 Pouring boiling hot oil over my hand was really not ideal 
7779 2018-04-06 21:20:59 I got the smashbox pore one because mine are so bad but I feel like it helps my oil but an oil control foundation I feel like that new maybelline one was THE SHIT at controlling my oil
7780 2018-04-06 21:20:57 NAME & SHAME!!

7781 2018-04-06 21:20:56 The tinman is republican, huh? Always asking for oil.
7782 2018-04-06 21:20:46 "For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:" -Proverbs 5:3 #Jesus = #God
7783 2018-04-06 21:20:44 I have met oil and gas folks from all over the world. I put my trust on the Canadian ones, who believe climate change is real and must be addressed. If you’re ok using fossil fuels from other places while punishing our economy, ok. But I think that is way more hypocritical.
7784 2018-04-06 21:20:41 Mary Falin is a big part of what wrong in Oklahoma, besides Greed and Stupidity, she is also Corrupt, just like her former Attorney General Scott Pruitt! Its all about kickbacks& buddy system! Corrupt $$Lottery,IndianCasinos,Oil&Gas, plus out of state well waste water inj tax!
7785 2018-04-06 21:20:36 I wish daddy was here so he could do an oil change on my car 
7786 2018-04-06 21:20:32 Business idea: Flu-ber, like uber except cars are notified when someone comes to work sick(usually by coworker)then they are promptly escorted off the premises and driven home in a car that's playing soothing music & has a peppermint and tea tree oil diffuser going full blast.
7787 2018-04-06 21:20:21 People always ask: “Why would I spray an oil?”   The “oil” isn’t an oil.  It is a synthetic isoparafin thats purity and chemistry allows for safe usage on turf grass.   The isoparafin is what primes the plant to allow its natural defenses to activate to fight plant stress.
7788 2018-04-06 21:20:17 Okay so here it is. I used to think y'all were being crazy going on about these diffusers and oils. But I told my mom we were all sick and stuffy so she got us one with the Breathe oil and I've had it on for like 5 minutes and I can already breathe! THIS IS AMAZING!
7789 2018-04-06 21:19:46 US sudden booming  economy can be explained by domestic over production of oil sold without commitment to oil price world wide ie subsidizing American economy by cheap oil Production now may be 20million barrel/day
7790 2018-04-06 21:19:45 Here's the real funny part of CBD & hemp products. Supposedly ppl can only grow hemp under a govt program or for research, yet I buy edible hemp seeds, hemp oil, and hemp supplements at my local Sprouts store. CBD products are sold like Avon & in catalogs or online.

7794 2018-04-06 21:19:25 Why do I have a weird crush on my oil change guy.
7795 2018-04-06 21:19:14 Jokes on you my gamer gold is rapidly increasing in value and soon it will overtake oil
7796 2018-04-06 21:19:02 Keep it oiled with sesame or linseed oil.

7798 2018-04-06 21:18:53 We aren't addicted to #oil, but our #cars are. - James Woolsey
7799 2018-04-06 21:18:36 The 2 yr counter-trend rally in oil is over. Oil is heading for $10 in the next yr as a global bust takes demand down hard. The inflation narrative that was calling for a breakout of inflation was a false narrative. Most of the recent inflation uptick was driven by this oil rally
7800 2018-04-06 21:17:59 I can explain. We don't own it, Ralph klien and his buddies sold the patch to China and USA companies. So the only way to get money from oil is to tax consumers.
7801 2018-04-06 21:17:59 Makes you wonder: to what extent was Pruitt's move a giveaway to the oil industry, rather than the auto industry.
7802 2018-04-06 21:17:44 It’s because of your new profile picture picture  maybe stop being hot?
7803 2018-04-06 21:17:44 Census #'s show rejection of liberal living vision; Amarillo man arrested for clapping at council meeting; Oil & gas rig count; Is the funding formula really "starving" Texas public school districts? + the news of Texas, 5 to 7pm on Pratt on Texas.

7805 2018-04-06 21:17:30 Breh they have a ducking oil diffuser in the therapists office and its making my headache worse
7806 2018-04-06 21:17:29 Big oil #deathculture #environment #ClimateChange a major shift has to take place to stop this #fossilfuel maddness. 
I do not want to imagine an oil spill.
7807 2018-04-06 21:17:28 Yeah no he’s doing it to himself moron. Appointments of oil and gas men to the EPA ... destroys the environment
7808 2018-04-06 21:17:27 Put 2-3 drops of tea tree oil in water and gargle. Natural antiseptic!
7809 2018-04-06 21:17:20 My  is sandwiched between Mother Russia and . The country of Tillerson and Putin for the Arctic Oil deal 900B$ . We have slingshots and canoes do defends ourselves. Oh yeah! We have Justin too.Justin Beiber I mean.Trudeau will want selfies with soldiers
7810 2018-04-06 21:17:18 Sugar do you know why the Alt Right is fighting between each other? as a oil business owner texan supremacist you must know something
7811 2018-04-06 21:17:06 本日の #どれミ の2次会参加枠まだ大丈夫なのでDM等で相談ください。
7812 2018-04-06 21:17:00 I also want to take a moment to celebrate this incredible achievement. If-HURK If we kept the oil, we would have been at 4 percent.
7813 2018-04-06 21:16:52 Still need to get this outfit for oil spill 
7814 2018-04-06 21:16:35 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
7815 2018-04-06 21:16:18 The oil change guys offered to change my burned out brake light for free but they didn’t expect it to be fused together with NL salt.

7818 2018-04-06 21:15:55 The only person doing damage is Trump and EPA Pruitt an oil and gas man. Your only showing how moronic you are
7819 2018-04-06 21:15:50 Just keep it under 20g of carbs a day, moderate protein and lots of leafy greens. Incorporate MCT/unrefined Coconut oil and grass fed butter and make sure you are taking a lot electrolytes with water.
7820 2018-04-06 21:15:32 I just tried to do the olive oil trick Jan taught to voice and movement and I’m crying I think she pranked us

7824 2018-04-06 21:15:10 @lbharding : Similar effects on cardiac development between oil and stormwater runoff. My impression: this means nearshore marine critters like herring are experiencing a chronic version of what they might experience as a pulse exposure in an oil spill  #SSEC18
7825 2018-04-06 21:14:17 No fair, my car's oil change was done and I had to drive home before I could sayyy
7826 2018-04-06 21:14:09 Pruitt started off as a bought-and-paid-for oil lobbyist out to destroy EPA.
Then it turned out he was a hopelessly corrupt actor as well.
Now it turns out that he's a straight-up dick in addition.
What will next week bring?
7827 2018-04-06 21:13:56 ضيعتها في اللعب  #اعتذر_لنفسي_لاني
7828 2018-04-06 21:13:55 He did approve one, remember all the pipelines Harper approved in his 5 times longer tenure? Yeah. ZERO.
Oil is currently well served v. demand, which is beginning to decline, getting out in front of that curve with innovation and tech in emerging sectors is a better plan.
7829 2018-04-06 21:13:54 Broke a nail today trying to get the oil cap on my car off  lol I need a boyfriend
7830 2018-04-06 21:13:54 Lavender essential oil mixed with coconut oil. You can add a tiny bit of peppermint too!
7831 2018-04-06 21:13:49 And mnuchin already tried to calm markets.

7832 2018-04-06 21:13:45 OH got Bold and I hate how artificial and over powering it smells. May try some lavender oil when I try it.
7833 2018-04-06 21:13:41 well he put enough of them out of jobs with Butts’ policies; least he can do is give them a #selfie BTW is he dressed up like a rugged oil patch worker>? #PMdressup #cdnpoli

7835 2018-04-06 21:12:59 So if he is such a great talent. What happened when Mcdavid got hurt in his rookie season? Why couldn’t he get 95 points and carry us into the playoffs?
7836 2018-04-06 21:12:41 you must realize how much oil has hurt the environment. yes, it has propelled us as a society but were evolving and we must start looking at tech and industry that does most good and least amt of harm.
Regards.
7837 2018-04-06 21:12:40 Funny how he has a blue check, but I can't even apply for one.
7838 2018-04-06 21:12:27 Dab peppermint oil on your forehead!
7839 2018-04-06 21:12:25 Yes, when it’s applied religiousy, it contains jojoba oil which is a key ingredient for hair growth and repair. The whipped cream is generally used for hair and skin health
7840 2018-04-06 21:12:16 Please @Boots UK stop krill oil products harvested in the Antarctic. This should be a simple request, humans can live without eating krill and krill products, while creatures living in the oceans can't. Please @BootsUK, we want to trust you to commit to  #ProtectAntarctic
7841 2018-04-06 21:11:58 Ditch the krill oil products! I was planning on shopping at Boots tomorrow, after reading about how you are still stocking  these products that are damaging the Artic, I will be going elsewhere!
@BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic
7842 2018-04-06 21:11:35 A flock of seagulls stamping the ground outside my office window yesterday. Conjuring up the worms, Dr Wachowich tells me. They too feel the downturn in the oil industry. Reminded me of scenes from Icelandic nightclubs mid 1980s, except with better hair. Conjuring up the worms.
7843 2018-04-06 21:11:19 I read Sandersons book, apparently right after this some Edmonton Oil King fans got him off the ice and went to town on him. #GoodTimes
7844 2018-04-06 21:11:13 I stayed up late to bake lemon muffins because I said I would and I forgot the oil and they’re complete ass and now it’s time to just give up on today and try life again tomorrow.
7845 2018-04-06 21:11:07 Will @BootsUK #ProtectAntarctic?  Please ban krill oil products.
7846 2018-04-06 21:11:06 Someone once said crude oil will be like water someday. With the new discovery in Bahrain, I am starting to agree.

Don’t say coconut oil 
7849 2018-04-06 21:10:57 @MeishaCBS3 Hey Gorgeous! Are you going to be burning the mid night oil!!?  You know what I mean up after 9pm!!   I want to have ask Meisha anything!! 
7850 2018-04-06 21:10:45 Oh my! 
The very selective Canadian environmentalists at work! 
Yup! Allow millions of gallons of raw sewage to flow into our waterways, but stop, the shipping of oil! 
Mmmm... even when First Nations groups OK it!
Wonder who’s funding Canada’s so called “environmentalists”?

7857 2018-04-06 21:09:53 When you take Wall Street money by the billions as Hillary did, they want something for it.

7860 2018-04-06 21:09:40 And stop giving tax breaks to oil
7861 2018-04-06 21:09:39 @PalmOilProject you mention on your website that "the solution isn't saying no to all palm oil...but instead to say no to palm oil that is produced unsustainably." How do we, as consumers, know that the palm oil we are using is produced "sustainably" (is there such a thing)?

7870 2018-04-06 21:08:40 I agree. Take off your pants.
7871 2018-04-06 21:08:38 The new ones aren't anymore. Had an XJ, YJ, WK, and bought my wife a JK for her birthday a few years back. 40k miles and only changed tires and oil.
7872 2018-04-06 21:08:28 The Radical Right along with the OiL and Coal Polluters  are supporting Climate denier head of EPA Scot Pruit! All they care about is big money for big money concerns , forgetting the people's  health ramifications involved in killing regulations. BAH!
7873 2018-04-06 21:08:16 My wife has that same tattoo on her shoulder.
7874 2018-04-06 21:08:07 No Im sure, there are always skeptics but I still think that unless you modified something that requires a different type of oil then usually the manufacturerer knows what it needs.
7875 2018-04-06 21:07:45 Bro what is your diet???
7876 2018-04-06 21:07:35 ดูคูมแม่ต้องใช้ความพยายามแกะมากยุ่นะนุช อย่าเคืองคูมแม่เลย คงบอกเอ๊ ตะไมรุ่นนี้มันแกะยากกว่าเดิม

7881 2018-04-06 21:06:58 Big oil has behaved in this country as if they are middle eastern sultans. Been like this since Spindletop in 1901. Pruitt knows nothing else.

7887 2018-04-06 21:06:16 Hey, oil prices are low. Guy's not made of money.
7888 2018-04-06 21:05:54 k, love ur oil industry even though renewable energy means a labor force with no end date. oil and coal will eventually run out, but the wind will keep blowing and the sun will keep shining. EPA ALSO PROTECTS UR LOVELY NATURAL LANDSCAPE FROM DEFORESTATION AND MICROPLASTICS
7889 2018-04-06 21:05:25 If you have a griddle (right) they are pretty easy to caramelize. A little butter substitute on the grill, onion slice on said oil, and about 3 minutes on each side (500+F griddle too) 
What, no griddle? Peasant)
7890 2018-04-06 21:05:13 I was upset all night..I have 10 cats...and I am sure  somebody asked. after all 1 Skripals  was recovering ..who's taking care of the pets? & that poison is oil based there should have a pile of little weeney teeny tiny dead bugs inside the apt ..neither happened why? Porquoi?
7891 2018-04-06 21:05:11 Stunning, would make a great oil painting!
7892 2018-04-06 21:05:10 Madison gave me a legit sports massage on his massage table with hot oil and started making fresh homemade soup & went to the store and got me medicine I was like okay maybe I do love him 
7893 2018-04-06 21:05:09 Just got a Free Oil change, who’s not blessed?
7894 2018-04-06 21:05:09 How long do you go before your oil changes? #Mercedes

7897 2018-04-06 21:04:47 Some autocross guys recommended it. I'm not the only person running the same oil
7898 2018-04-06 21:04:45 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
7899 2018-04-06 21:04:36 Most likely the tweet where he said "I advocate for all gun owners to be hanged"
7900 2018-04-06 21:04:27 Mineral Oil
7901 2018-04-06 21:04:10 The fucking pump at the gas station got stuck and spilled everywhere and now I smell like oil
7902 2018-04-06 21:03:40 And don’t put it on clothing, put on body. It makes oil stains on clothes obviously black person
7903 2018-04-06 21:03:39 I love the smell of tanning oil 
7904 2018-04-06 21:03:26 It's the same viscosity as the premium euro oil. It's more of a life hack lol it's still oil and I'm saving $15 on each oil change
7905 2018-04-06 21:03:23 do y'all look at people's gums? I do and idc. Oil pull and floss PEOPLE. It's not normal for your gums to swell & take up half your teeth
7906 2018-04-06 21:03:16 BP claims a oil spill off Australias coast would be a boost in the economy, It just shows their attitude to natural areas ... they need to be sent packing and fast.. all oil and mining companies.., Can you imagine a huge spill in NZ,

7909 2018-04-06 21:02:53 Please don’t call them conservatives, they’re oil and gas interests.  Conservatives have done great things for our environment, the goal of this group is getting their noses as deep as they can in the public trough.
7910 2018-04-06 21:02:52 getting my oil changed and the guy helping me looks and sounds exactly like @Sethrogen
7911 2018-04-06 21:02:49 Someone should please help me with any website where I can be getting daily exchange rate of dollar(USD) to naira.

And site where I can be getting daily crude oil price too or even a site for both.

I'm working on a project that needs daily 6-12months record.

7918 2018-04-06 21:02:17 Wake up. Do u really think shutting down all coal mines and oil fields helped our industries.
7919 2018-04-06 21:02:10 Aye I’m really about to say fuck this driving shit and become a pedestrian again. If it ain’t LAPD, it’s high ass gas, an oil change, car getting towed, or a wheel alignment. You win LA. I will take the fucking bus!

7926 2018-04-06 21:01:19 Like most sensible people Derek, if I don't trust gov't I go out and find the truth myself. I was out in the rain last night outside the Wall Centre telling our PM it's not about a pipeline, it's about oil tankers. If they were saying what you're saying, I'd need a different sign
7927 2018-04-06 21:01:15 Thanks , I’ll check the oil based . Hope they work .

7930 2018-04-06 21:00:37 It's long past time to #FirePruitt. He's basically a malignant coal fog, a disease vector, a parasite feasting on oil and blood and endangered species, a neurotoxin wrapped (unconvincingly) in human skin.

7936 2018-04-06 21:00:02 Sunflower oil is high in Vitamin E that can be crucial for preventing UV damage and scarring, as well as reducing the appearance of wrinkles. It also includes vitamin A and beta-carotene.

7940 2018-04-06 21:00:00 Do they make spray nowadays that does not have "weird chemicals" in it? I typically just put a few drops of pure oil in and then smear it around with a little piece of paper towel... 00
7941 2018-04-06 20:59:59 Sorry for the late response.....been a busy week at work. But which oil do you trade? Is there a reason for your preference?

Did reply to the oil and logs comment.
7945 2018-04-06 20:59:43 Lol. No. You can use oil based. The fume in the alcohol blocks so use oil based rather.
7946 2018-04-06 20:59:35 Oh good! Usually when you put an oil in your face or body and then get into the sun or get hot, a heat rash occurs. Sometimes it’ll be like itty bitty water blisters and red splotches that can itch bad. I get it all the time living in 120’ summers in Mississippi 
7947 2018-04-06 20:59:35 Buy food or an oil change

7952 2018-04-06 20:58:36 Ask the douchebag to explain the Carboniferous Period when there were no SUV's or oil companies.
7953 2018-04-06 20:58:36 guess it works different for some, cause anara has eczema and I used the extra virgin oil for about a week  on her face and the rash is completely gone .. that and you gotta keep cool too
7954 2018-04-06 20:58:32 TY danjuma who owns a oil block and has private jet and military escort. OBJ ...
7955 2018-04-06 20:58:15 They're made by the oil companies, who do their own studies on the impacts of pipelines, the results of which Trudeau would prefer to cite, rather than conducting independent studies.
7956 2018-04-06 20:58:10 #ukog I have to say that the documentary on Netflix, called ‘the China Hustle’ is very good. You guys must watch. For us we need to see the oil tankers.
7957 2018-04-06 20:58:05 Canada, yes Canada has more oil reserves than Nigeria and we can see it's not a mono economy. It's not crazily dependent on it's oil
7958 2018-04-06 20:57:52 No, but stuff I do at home is simple like tomatoes with olive oil and salt.

7961 2018-04-06 20:57:22 Without Arab Oil Money? Oh cos our players are called Crude Oil, Palm Oil, coconut oil. congrats
7962 2018-04-06 20:57:13 So in order to stay in #Syria the #US is shuffling #ISIS around in Helos to different areas. As long as there are pockets of ISIS remaining the US can maintain their excuse to occupy 1/3 of Syria where the oil is.  One goal is to keep Syria cash starved. No oil no money!
7963 2018-04-06 20:57:01 @maninblack981 b/c MLK would've cheered his cowardice on DACA, &as Standing Rock Natives &journos were beaten/shot by armed Big Oil goons and the reintroduction of black genocide/slavery in Libya,right?

7969 2018-04-06 20:56:30 i just made a tea tree oil and rose water spray and i’m so happy i can’t stop misting my face w it jdjshs
7970 2018-04-06 20:56:25 Our part time actor Prime Minister continuing to "act" like he supports the oil and gas business in Canada when everyone paying attention knows he wants to kill it - just like his father.
7971 2018-04-06 20:56:24 LOL if you had olive oil that works too
7972 2018-04-06 20:56:07 Clearly dated 2016, this graft sadly proves my point, to wit:

Every state collecting GPT has politicians w/stones to charge a fair amount; putting students+teachers ahead of their donors+personal aspirations.

Even in crisis #okleg still taxes all oil <they blow on fuel.
7973 2018-04-06 20:56:04 Oil, oil and oil. That's the only thing we can comprehend in our own myopic ways. Fools, fools and fools.
7974 2018-04-06 20:55:57 Oh my bad lol the purpose is that it extracts oil from the ground and it cause a lot of shaking on the ground and pollutes water
7975 2018-04-06 20:55:54 #beardgang apply caster oil to promote growth my g
7976 2018-04-06 20:55:36 I'm looking 5 years or more down the road. In my kids resp.   Ain't worried.  Till water or sunshine powers a frickin 787 jet for 14hrs, we still gonna need oil and pipelines.  Always gonna be cold as shit in Canada in winter.
7977 2018-04-06 20:55:34 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
7978 2018-04-06 20:55:29 Wait, jeans?? No sweats?? I cry foul. You should take those off.
7979 2018-04-06 20:55:02 Kenny, has no real understanding of ANYTHING ! He is all about dogwhistle politics to the refugee haters and immigrants. He knows nothing about economics.He knows nothing of the complexities of the oil industry. Why would you vote for that ?
7980 2018-04-06 20:54:33 Thank you!
7981 2018-04-06 20:54:31 What no sweatpants?
7982 2018-04-06 20:54:24 There has to be a surcharge the oil companies put on those cities so we don't foot the bill for this nonsense.
7983 2018-04-06 20:54:19 While I agree that means that industry has to bear the cost and the risk. And some recyclables are commodity driven. Used oil is an example. There is a break even point where the drilling for crude is cheaper than recycling used oils. 1/2
7984 2018-04-06 20:54:10 why did I have to grow up aspiring to be a songwriter why couldn’t I have been passionate about becoming an oil tycoon
7985 2018-04-06 20:54:08 Libras & Scorpios don’t mix like water and oil

for watercolor - Rebelle
for ink/sumi e - Expresii
for pencil - Graphiter
and for oil - WetBrush.. if you'll ever release it someday, because i'm not already sure.
7990 2018-04-06 20:53:36 Not even close! Sure, inflation was high, Volker (a Carter appointee) had that in hand. ANY deficit spending (single payer health care!) would have the same effect of stimulating the economy. USSR was on the ropes because of oil prices more than defense costs.
7991 2018-04-06 20:53:32 Vegetables, meats (i dont eat meat much tho), quinoa (some people might react to this), fish,  fresh fruits, i eat a speghetti made out of spinach that doesnt fuck w me. Cooked only w oil. Butter is a no, cows eat grains and you can react to wheat in their milk.

7995 2018-04-06 20:53:13 oooo ya +1 for hair oil
7996 2018-04-06 20:53:12 Yes ma'am
7997 2018-04-06 20:53:07 Russia started selling its oil in yuan, this will have an effect on both the dollar and the pound. uk will create many cock and bull stories to badger russia. Remember over half a million iraqy died due to so called wmd, but there was none. Iraq wanted to sell its oil in euro.
7998 2018-04-06 20:52:56 There it is
7999 2018-04-06 20:52:54 The Biggest Danger is #Houthis can easily target and destroy #SaudiAramco #Safaniya Oil field and #Ghawar Oil field and turn #SaudiArabia into a beggar in just a day and put an end to #YemenGenocide

8003 2018-04-06 20:52:35 Have you tried using a daily conditioner and not washing it all the way out? I know some people also have success with oil (Jojoba, Argan, etc.) but you might have to try a few out to see which works with your hair type.
8004 2018-04-06 20:52:22 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
8005 2018-04-06 20:52:21 Easy to be dismissive but how many Americans knew the depth of health data being monetized before? With data being the "new oil" to quote @intel's CEO, expect pushback from public.
8006 2018-04-06 20:52:04 Sorry, I put quotes on there to pretend to be a guy amazed at changing oil.
8007 2018-04-06 20:51:59 If I don’t marry the man that changes my oil then imma be real disappointed
8008 2018-04-06 20:51:56 wasnt this an oil meme?
8009 2018-04-06 20:51:51 Then stop your Fulani murderers from doing their so obvious ethnic cleansing game in collusion with Nigerian military forces. Or is oil more important than human lives!?
8010 2018-04-06 20:51:50 Russia has long sought economic and military dominance in part of the  world where as much as $35 trillion worth of untapped oil and natural  gas could be lurking. Now China is pushing its way into the Arctic, announcing last month its ambitions to develop a "Polar Silk Road"
8011 2018-04-06 20:51:36 The Oil Money FC 
8012 2018-04-06 20:51:32 We can't afford the teachers, teaching assistants & teaching resources to teach the students without you! SBM/SBLs oil the cogs!!

8014 2018-04-06 20:51:24 They doin background checks at this gun show?
8015 2018-04-06 20:51:23 Speaking it into existence: Ima be wealthy within the next 12 years. I’m gonna marry someone who owns oil, uranium, coal mines, stocks & makes a come up, prince, a king, an heir. I want old money not NEW money 
8016 2018-04-06 20:51:22 He won't release it because he knows how people will react. it so completely obvious he's an oil lacky.
8017 2018-04-06 20:51:18 i love oil
oIL? YOU LOVE OIL? AAAHHHLLL
8018 2018-04-06 20:51:13 I made rutabaga french fries in olive oil with ginger & s/p & they were delicious.
8019 2018-04-06 20:51:03 I'd love to try oil painting but have mainly done acrylic work and dabbled in watercolor
8020 2018-04-06 20:51:00 Oil on the road
8021 2018-04-06 20:50:49 I despise Walmart but where else can I get a oil change, a full set, rillos, and some good leggings in one stop?
8022 2018-04-06 20:50:41 can't be a war zone there's no oil in Croydon
8023 2018-04-06 20:50:39 This is BS. Obama pushed for international sanctions that stopped an oil pipeline deal with Exxon, ended exports of dual-use equipment, blocked access to American financial markets and set the Russian economy into a tailspin.
8024 2018-04-06 20:50:32 Ya know it’s bummer there isn’t a cute little bunny  in the background that way you could see if anyone would notice it... so instead will comment on the nice tree lol  enjoy the toys
8025 2018-04-06 20:50:31 Andurand cries deep inside. So does that narrative pushing "PHD" from Iraq who wanted to sue me who kept claiming US oil production was not real, and that we wouldn't get this far with it. Well..............he is looking extra stupid now.
8026 2018-04-06 20:50:22 I had struggles falling asleep the last 3 weeks so now I try of lavender oil helps

8033 2018-04-06 20:49:28 Yup. Stopped out of that one a looong time ago. I was wrong. I also shorted oil at $120 down to $30. You win some big ones, lose some small ones. I’m not short oil yet, except XOM..but I feel it’s a good probability soon

8041 2018-04-06 20:48:25 Though... And this is an important tip... drain it BEFORE removing the oil filter.
And like... definitely don't FILL it before replacing the filter.

8166 2018-04-06 20:34:44 So Trump calls Billionaire Oil Tycoon for advise on EPA? Get the f**k out of here? He is bending to the pressure of an OIL Tycoon on EPA issues!

8169 2018-04-06 20:34:31 I’ve drilled several wells for some large independents down around Catarina and Carrizo Springs. The oil companies all had strict gun policies. However, the ranch foreman or landowner would come around and tell us we would be foolish not to carry. The companies turned a blind

8175 2018-04-06 20:33:48 Could you please explain how Scotland's economy is lagging behind rUK when the price of oil has risen 30 percent in the last six months. The price of natural gas has also risen 18 percent in that time so does that mean oil and gas are not attributed to SCOTLANDS economy
8176 2018-04-06 20:33:46 I love this oil for my face, it doesn’t make my face greasy or shiny. It still gives me that glow.
8177 2018-04-06 20:33:43 I have a oil leak in my car. Where can I go to get it fixed? A place that won’t take my whole check. Lol.
8178 2018-04-06 20:33:39 coconut oil does wonders for eczema

8180 2018-04-06 20:33:17 As @ABDanielleSmith said on her show this morning. Google images of Trudeau and oil workers  vs Trudeau and steel workers. It's quite telling. So pardon me if I don't cheer Trudeau's visit.
8181 2018-04-06 20:33:17 Okay the difference between what Rihanna released and all the smaller brands is that hers is more like a gel/lotion vs being a sparkly oil. That makes a big difference
8182 2018-04-06 20:33:13 Yeah! Nothing makes me angrier than big-money people orchestrating astro-turfed movements! Oil and gas would never do that! 

Wait...
8183 2018-04-06 20:33:00 Faith and Trump is like water and oil. Not buying it.
8184 2018-04-06 20:32:58 No. But I’m not sure what the problem is. Folk have always bought snake oil.

8193 2018-04-06 20:32:40 @realdonaldtrump too weak to fire @EPAScottPruitt. He is probably doing the bidding of his big donors and oil men. What a disgrace. I thought Trump was going to #draintheswamp. He is the swamp. #maga #trumptrain #deplorables 3republicans #qanon #tcot Weak Weak Weak

8199 2018-04-06 20:32:04 it's Friday, what should I do after work; get my oil changed, go grocery shopping, or have a cocktail? Hmmm, tough choices
8200 2018-04-06 20:31:58 Washing a plastic bowl that had Oil/Palm Oil in it, really pains me.
8201 2018-04-06 20:31:43 In 2008 when the global financial crash happened Scotland wasn't in deficit, actually if Scotland had been Indy longer would have oil fund.
8202 2018-04-06 20:31:31 shame we haven't got that Iranian oil anymore
8203 2018-04-06 20:31:31 And it couldn’t just be the oil pan like everyone else

8214 2018-04-06 20:29:33 Idk how people fry in shallow oil
8215 2018-04-06 20:29:26 Any time I’ve driven through Carpenteria in Southern California I am reminded why oil riggers off the coastline are a bad idea. It would have been so beautiful, but not anymore.

8217 2018-04-06 20:29:24 @AlMayadeenNews Now that China has surpassed the U.S. as the world’s largest oil importer, the country is seeking to end the standardization of oil trade in dollars, moving instead to the yuan. Make no mistake; this could mean death for the Petrodollar
8218 2018-04-06 20:28:59 Yes. Please. And I’m still looking for some help around here if you make to TN!

8220 2018-04-06 20:28:18 Final question: have you ever gone so long without changing your oil that it caused your engine to seize up, forcing you to get it towed and probably destroying the engine in the process?
8221 2018-04-06 20:28:07 Scott Pruitt?! Are you kidding?He was AG in Ok, and we know He is a CROOK! He denied global warming. He denied that fracking caused earthquakes, he sold this State out to big oil every time! He is out for one person, and that’s Scott Pruitt!

The files show that in 2011, VTB funded a $191m investment in Twitter."

8236 2018-04-06 20:26:55 Guess synthetic oil rlly is worth it eh
8237 2018-04-06 20:26:46 I think you got off topic... this article was about free speech not oil and gas.
8238 2018-04-06 20:26:34 Except the alternative energy fuels electric, corn, and hydrogen aren’t as efficient or as easily transported as oil. Oil/Gas when you need combustion for your car, truck or bus still is the best way to power your car. Takies abou 2 minutes to fill up your tank.

8242 2018-04-06 20:26:12 Why do you say that? Trudeau (as well as Notley) is in favour of pipelines. Sure, he’s inept, but he can’t change the fact that people in other provinces have what they feel are legitimate concerns about oil pipelines and deep water oil terminals.

8252 2018-04-06 20:25:18 Add the abandonment of children, physical weigh loss, mass power outages, the 1/3 less oil output,  and the near 1000% inflation to the poisonous socialist cocktail
8253 2018-04-06 20:25:16 So. Much. Stupid. Advocating for diversity is the exact opposite of defining by race. And the Iraq war, led by US Repubs and supported by Cons for the acquisition of oil, was not a "liberal intervention". I could go on.

8256 2018-04-06 20:24:55 Since China is the world’s largest trading economy and the largest buyer of commodities like oil products, China could use its influence to push its own currency, RMB, in global markets to reduce the dominance of the US dollar. That would be a heavy blow to Washington ZH
8257 2018-04-06 20:24:50 52 countries in the world have a majority of Islamic adherents. Name one which is liberal & socially advanced. Even the rich ones (purely because of oil) are terrible. So what benefit is there to Western nations having an increasing presence of Islam? What does it bring?

8259 2018-04-06 20:24:36 Well, yeah, the words "climate change" make oil companies sad and we can't have that!
8260 2018-04-06 20:24:24 So the 'left' politicians villify and protest the oil and gas industry and then ask them to cough up funds to help pay for the so called climate change issues in the Province and Cities. Don't you know if you shut them down there will be no funds? Dumb
8261 2018-04-06 20:24:23 Hot!!!! Body isn't too bad either

8269 2018-04-06 20:23:00 Remember, the GOP is rallying around a guy who rented an apartment at a bargain rate from an oil lobbyist. ANY defense will work for them if it saves their precious tax cuts.

8272 2018-04-06 20:22:41 When Saudi Arabia gives in to China’s pressure to trade oil in yuan, the rest of the world is sure to follow. This would mean the end of the petrodollar as we know it, sending the value of the world’s reserve currency into a nosedive.

8288 2018-04-06 20:20:48 One thing is certain next year regardless of the winner: Petrol pump price will increase if crude oil prices continue to rise. 2019 election is the only reason it has not been increased.

8308 2018-04-06 20:18:50 Mr. Shapiro, you are right, the way Maduro will say about the visit U.S.Rep. Sessions,will be US came to talk.Probably oil is behind the visit,Chevron is operating in Venezuela.Two possible topics, Sanctions crude oil, and Maduro is trying to impose PETRO's.
8309 2018-04-06 20:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
8310 2018-04-06 20:18:35 Well c'mon the head of the EPA doesn't believe in climate change nor does he look at the actual data and proof. He's a money grubbing scumbag thats so deep in Russian oil money he doesn't give two shits about anything else.

8313 2018-04-06 20:18:25 Lankford has to protect his employer, the oil & gas lobby and Trump, not Oklahoman's. Same exact situation with Pruitt.

8318 2018-04-06 20:17:48 Mr. President if Mexico wants to play hard ball, let's play, it's time to impose a 35% remittance tax to all remittances going to Mexico. Remember since 2014 the first source of Mexican economy income are the U.S. remittances above oil, mining, agriculture, etc. and end NAFTA.
8319 2018-04-06 20:17:42 SPORT: Bryngwran Bulls have won the Lucas Oil Cup after beating Mynydd Tigers 3-0 in Bangor tonight.

8321 2018-04-06 20:17:36 There would have been a call for the Senator to step down and a witch hunt to follow.  Same thing with the talk show host. To get such joy out of the suggestion to kill someone out of hatred is pathetic.  How is it when the liberal left lectures all of us to love ...hate so much
8322 2018-04-06 20:17:34 hmu i got oil on my skin i know yall want that
8323 2018-04-06 20:17:33 The propaganda spewed by climate scientists against the oil business is equally suspect and without proof. Again, IMO.
8324 2018-04-06 20:17:05 No way
8325 2018-04-06 20:16:49 LOL look at these “Freedom Lovers” defending corruption. What you heinous ppl are doing is pure evil. How many more kids will die from asthma because of pollution? Do you not care as long as oil CEOs get richer? You don’t deserve to breathe the same air as the rest of us

8331 2018-04-06 20:16:11 The first time Zions arm got damaged and the oil was leaking Meeno was probably shocked af.

Transmission fluid has a red (when new) or brownish colour to it.. I bet Meeno could mistake it.
That's probably one time Zion is laughing. It's just leaking!!

8335 2018-04-06 20:15:38 Yes & any one who cares about our energy, our economy, and all those 6,000 items that come from oil should too. Who wants to keep buying oil from shitty countries overseas when we have our own! Who does that? We also sell to the USA who gets one HELL of a deal!! Pathetic
8336 2018-04-06 20:15:13 It was! But he also wanted olive oil so who the flip knows. He was elderley and sitting in the road though so he can have whatever he wants!

8338 2018-04-06 20:15:08 There is science to back up the "claims" that oil and gas are harming the environment. Science doesn't really care what you "believe"... Not trying to be divisive, just trying to establish a base line for intelligent debate.
8339 2018-04-06 20:15:06 Dig dip into his history and you won’t find oil but rather another dark substance.   One evil; always evil.
8340 2018-04-06 20:15:00 Why do I randomly keep hearing Midnight Oil (yes that same fucking song) and The Stand (yes that same fucking song) ?

Anyone?

8343 2018-04-06 20:14:45 I get them pretty regularly so I feel your pain. Staying hydrated helps. This sounds wierd but icey hot from you temples down your neck helps. Can also use peppermint oil.
8344 2018-04-06 20:14:43 Everyone I know in my state is angry. Our kids aren’t being educated, our teachers aren’t being valued, and our governor is acting with disdain towards values she runs for every year. It’s becoming apparent we’ve let Big Oil run Oklahoma for too long.

8358 2018-04-06 20:13:21 Can’t show the chart as I’m on a plane but oil looks to be forming a GMI crash pattern. Feels like trouble to come...
8359 2018-04-06 20:13:05 My folks are visiting. Today they were mortified to find that there was no cooking/vegetable or sunflower oil in my house. My father asked how I managed not to die of starvation! Once again I’m letting the Indian side down!
8360 2018-04-06 20:13:02 is it possible that syria is a battleground for oligarchs who want oil for their armies?
thousands of years of history demolished
millions of civilians killed or displaced.

WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY FIGHTING OVER???
8361 2018-04-06 20:12:58 Exactly. You don't pay shit. You don't pay rent/mortgage, you don't pay for gas/oil, you don't pay for electric, cable, food, clothes. You can't talk about any of that since you have zero clue about it you squatter

8364 2018-04-06 20:12:51 Pruitt is working for the oil companies instead of the environment, so of course he wants to keep his corruption as secret as possible.

8402 2018-04-06 20:08:46 Cant even fathom it. Though in the minds of many, it would have fallen back onto the player in some fashion or another.
8403 2018-04-06 20:08:46 Sigh. What next? Caltrops in the hallways? Or maybe some nice slippery oil? Crossbows made from paperclips and pencils? I feel like we've gone from reality into a ridiculous comedy sketch.

8409 2018-04-06 20:07:58 Life is suddenly too much and all I want to do is cry and buy hot churros from a street vendor who uses the same oil for months. Is that too much to ask?
8410 2018-04-06 20:07:57 War is a MONEY MACHINE. Trump wants Putin to make some cash since his oil deal through Tillerson is on the back burner. Putin wants his money back!

8424 2018-04-06 20:05:26 Listening to Trudeau a few minutes ago it is clear he is convinced that lots of ships will be able to scoop up any spilled oil. I don’t know what he thinks is going to happen when it all sinks but I know this it will not be scooped up no matter how many ships he puts out there.

8443 2018-04-06 20:03:12 I am sorry but Trita Parsi works for the oil lobby and represent the elite in Iran; the parasitic ruling class.

8455 2018-04-06 20:01:34 Do not believe everything you hear o, it’s not safe.  In dis age someone come to Twitter and ask us to tell him the difference between olive oil and anointing oil? Imagine!

8460 2018-04-06 20:01:08 It happened recently where I worked, they saw a cat on top of an AC in one of the offices and everyone was coming with 'anointing oil' without addressing the fact that the office is in a crowded area where the residents have many cats

8465 2018-04-06 20:00:32 @Boots uk #ProtectAntarctic I am very disappointed that you are still stocking krill oil sourced from penguin & whale breeding grounds.Only 2 out of 40,000 penguin chicks survived last season,it is so upsetting.Other shops have stopped,please can you?
8466 2018-04-06 20:00:31 23 ethics violations & Lank sees no issues. No problem w Pruitt renting WDC room for $50 a night from wife of major oil/gas lobbyist, because they're just old friends? Trump phones Lankford & Cole whenever they're on TV? Guess to let them know if their lies were good enough? Sad
8467 2018-04-06 20:00:30 Trump doesn't care about America.  He proved that by dismantling the EPA and selling off our parks for mining and our coastal waters for oil exploration.

8469 2018-04-06 20:00:15  RT @MyPotnaB: Used the staff bathroom after one of the women coworkers. I'll never be able to look at her the same. That smell was.. not human. She needs an oil change or sumn.
8470 2018-04-06 20:00:13 I have steel cut oats with shredded apple and maple syrup for breakfast or a cantaloupe anything with no flour, sugar, oil or salt. I made a huge pot of this. I've had it for lunch every day. I have a salad (sub avocado for oil in dressing) and a curry or bean tacos for dinner.

8474 2018-04-06 19:59:53 It’s body oil, actually forgot the scent name. It’s at home.
8475 2018-04-06 19:59:49 Has anyone thought of why all of a sudden there is a caravan pushing immigrants out of Honduras And why the US is not helping with that situation when we can go to Iraq to help where there is oil and mining resources?  Allow a path to citizenship legally.
8476 2018-04-06 19:59:38 Maybe we can be like Venezuela.  We have oil and a thriving economy, now all we need is a leftist president to take us there.

8481 2018-04-06 19:59:17 While it is encouraging that Secretary Zinke has implied that the Administration understands that drilling for oil and gas off of the East Coast is not a viable option, it is concerning that the Secretary has not provided concrete assurance to New Jerseyans.

8485 2018-04-06 19:58:52 I will be boycotting @BootsUK until they stop using Krill Oil in their products and begin to accept the environmental implications of their actions #ProtectAntarctic

8490 2018-04-06 19:58:21 An independent Scotland has the potential to be one of the richest countries on earth. Trade, an established banking system, resource rich, outward looking, world class brands, small population, and OIL.

However, some Scholars say these other substances (such as oil) were not around in that time.

8503 2018-04-06 19:57:39 Capitalists only see $$$$. Sad. But I think people are slowly waking up to realize, as Native Americans have been telling us, "You can't eat oil."
8504 2018-04-06 19:57:38 If you’re at school or in public leave a little bit of oil on your sweatershirt or clothing.
8505 2018-04-06 19:57:38 Oil and gas companies want it....
8506 2018-04-06 19:57:34 I haven’t been in Alberta except for passing through airports in about thirty years. I’m not the one who refused to have a PST or charge market price for oil royalties during the boom and left the coffers empty when the oil price inevitably dropped.
8507 2018-04-06 19:57:34 I use Jamaican castor oil on Kyrons hair like I old school grease his scalp with it. Also deep condition when you wash, don’t be afraid to let that conditioner sit.
8508 2018-04-06 19:57:32 @LizClaman FYI the rigs that are added are not pumping oil.  They only drill the wells.   They must then be completed and fractured before production can begin.  This takes 3 months to a year or more depending on location.
8509 2018-04-06 19:57:27 Found washed ashore from an oil spill

8511 2018-04-06 19:57:11 Build pipelines to move Oil to the East where those crooks in Quebec import 650k barrels a day from countries who could give a shit about the environment and that will free up capacity to move grain. What’s 500m the Punk spends that on shit with no returns to the country
8512 2018-04-06 19:57:09 Do you have kids (or adults) that have stinky smelling feet?  Lafe's has a solution, check out our freshly rebranded Lafe's Foot Spray with Organic Peppermint Oil which reduces odor and helps relieve itching.  Be Safe (and less stinky) Use Lafe's!
8513 2018-04-06 19:57:03 How bad a person are you if 
a) landlord locks you out by a and b) an oil lobbyist leaks it about the epa chief #PruittMustGo
8514 2018-04-06 19:57:01 Our relationships with farmers is just one of our top priorities. In fact, we work with farmers directly in eight countries globally, so we know exactly where our #oliveoil comes from. Full traceability means olive oil you can trust. #Pompeian
8515 2018-04-06 19:56:58 Because shipping unrefined oil out of the country is the same as shipping raw logs out of the country, All the good paying job's go away.
8516 2018-04-06 19:56:51 You guys still think you need to spend $280k to figure out why oil and gas industry is declining so badly? Or did someone explain it to you in single syllables so you can comprehend the situation?
8517 2018-04-06 19:56:46 Oil will make the skin blacken and not get moist, its the moisture in the skin that makes it bubble and make good crackling
8518 2018-04-06 19:56:45 @MSNBC Don't believe this 4 percent bullshit, there are tons of people that dropped out of the labor market 10 years ago like I did. I got behind during the oil embargo days of the 70's and there have to be tons of people like me!!!!

8520 2018-04-06 19:56:41 Everyone except enviro-Luddites call it oil sands. Considering that tar is a distillate of coal and wood fibre, not oil, it’s also technically a misnomer. Oh Henry’s look like turds but we don’t call them feces bars to get ppl to stop buying them cause we oppose diabetes.
8521 2018-04-06 19:56:14 .@AP But even *that* only hints at the issue.

@tomfriedman spent the last several years repeatedly reciting that losing your place in the supply chain was "like pouring cement down an oil well."

You never get your place in the supply chain *back.*
8522 2018-04-06 19:56:09 I recommend peppermint tea. That and lavender essential oil. I use a little drop of  oil on my pillow to help calm my nerves.

8525 2018-04-06 19:55:14 'Mining' oil is expensive, which means Canadians need to be getting the best price possible & that means selling it to a GLOBAL MARKET, not giving every FIFTH barrel away( a 20% $ reduction) to our neighbour to the South.  This makes both our economies lax & reliant on cheap fuel
8526 2018-04-06 19:55:08 Ohhh now that’s a new one, butcher told me to coat the skin in salt for an hour before cooking, add olive oil to skin, looking quite promising if I’m honest

8533 2018-04-06 19:53:43 Big deadlines all met. I may now quietly succumb to the plague. 

Wish I was in New Orleans. Yeah I know I can buy the mix and make bingets here but without cottonseed oil, what's the point?
8534 2018-04-06 19:53:43 Yes of course there is something that called monq they looks like cigarettes but they not they , there is oil inside them
8535 2018-04-06 19:53:43 What the fuck do you mean he "fixed" it? This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. If by denying it in order to support big oil and all those other careless assholes, then yeah, you tell yourself that at night.
8536 2018-04-06 19:53:41 trudeau will do nothing for fort macmurray&oil sands development..i ask how a PM didnt know of the technical R&D working in the oil sands!!!
8537 2018-04-06 19:53:38 IMO people can believe what they want to believe about the fatal threat to earth from oil and gas production/transportation. I do not believe fossil fuels present that threat. People who do simply want to argue and not discuss. That’s being divisive.
8538 2018-04-06 19:53:37 I'm hoping all the teachers and families at the Capitol are realizing who is on their side and who isn't, who works for oil companies and who works for average people. Dems will fight for people, not corporations. I hope this opens people's eyes.
8539 2018-04-06 19:53:25 When people say “you shouldn’t take all those supplements,” they have no clue what they are talking about.

Taking Vit D3, Fish Oil, B12, if needed, is no issue.

So the only thing they could be remotely right on is if the supplements were “tainted,” causing a problem.

8547 2018-04-06 19:52:37 Oh god I almost forgot his grandstanding lawsuit against oil companies! He’ll sue oil companies but won’t take one lousy step to change his own behavior, or lift a finger on issues he actually has direct control over. What a disgusting hypocrite.
8548 2018-04-06 19:52:27 Someone needs to tell Liz that the rigs being added do not pump oil.  They merely dig the hole.  The wells them must be completed and frac'd.  That happens later.  Takes 6 months or more to bring a new well on production.
8549 2018-04-06 19:52:25 @CBCAlerts trudeau came to alberta full of hate for harper..who actually developed more oil&gas technically than has trudeau!! JTspent 100,000$to bring french reporters out to Alberta..what a waste!

8576 2018-04-06 19:49:02 True! In my country of birth, the Netherlands, CBD oil is on the shelfs of supermarkets! Every household can legally grow 5 plants and produce their own thc containing oil! Same with euthanasia laws....sigh...might have to migrate back there...
8577 2018-04-06 19:48:37 "They have been winning" BUT the American people are getting screwed! As a small business owner my taxes went up. Inflation already started. Gas prices going up yet oil dirt cheep.

8582 2018-04-06 19:48:01 Perhaps it's because Russia has WMDs.

Also, oil.


8583 2018-04-06 19:47:55 .@AP We have already hit the key tipping point where new solar/wind are  cheaper than new coal plants.

Coal is effectively finished as an energy source - top 4 US producers  lost 99% value in 5 years. Gas & oil are on the same path.

8587 2018-04-06 19:47:20 .@AP In mid-2014, 25% of Russia's economy & 50% of her government revenues came from oil/gas.

Russia exports oil, gas & weapons.

8615 2018-04-06 19:44:59 I believe oil companies know an uphill battle when they see one and simply choose not to go that route. They also plan and see the future decades ahead of how you and I plan things.

Any significant drop in oil demand in, say, 2018 will decimate the industry further.

Clinton’s did dirty things in office. Ok. So it’s ok for the trumps now?
8672 2018-04-06 19:40:00 The actions of Pruitt have endangered our environment. He is an oil man. His main objective is to eliminate EPA regulations. It's about money, not the greater good for Americans. That's why he's getting rid of the cafe standards for cars. High mpg means less oil use.

8674 2018-04-06 19:39:57 The refining of our cheap oil is limited to plants that can actually refine the bitumen.  Not all refineries can refine that oil vs the sweet oil drilled and pumped out of the ground. Guess I am saying reality is more complex than what you state
8675 2018-04-06 19:39:33 They rely on parroting things provided to them by their perceived "people's champions"  (often to mask their real motivation)..they have been manipulated ..useful 'cannon fodder'..It is very hard to concede so when easier to seek refuge with the still prevalent snake oil salesmen

8709 2018-04-06 19:34:31 “Redistribution is bad because people get money they didn’t work for”

Yea well big oil and finance got their money by lying, cheating and STEALING.

It’s not redistribution. 
It’s simply returning stolen resources.

8717 2018-04-06 19:33:55 It’s easy to make homemade sugar scrubs. Coconut oil, sugar and essential oils. Done.
8718 2018-04-06 19:33:37 I never said they were re-selling it. They are selling their oil to the world and back stopping their domestic demand with our cheap oil.
8719 2018-04-06 19:33:03 Just seen this Caucasian female on hood of her truck putting oil in with her ass all out... that shit was sexy and them shorts on her ass  Damn I should have taken a pic

8722 2018-04-06 19:32:46 Serious consultations, citizen deliberation, and community-level programs by the government would engage citizenry to be involved in our shared future beyond oil. We need to hear that there's another vision possible, says @LaurieAdkin

8723 2018-04-06 19:32:44 The muddy water here really is a mix of things. Because there are many foreign companies who want to do business with Canada. The trade-off is some are lobbying to trade more oil with Canada and some of them are run by earth hippies.

While we compile the scores, can you explain the low level of oil floating over the stew?
8732 2018-04-06 19:31:23 Wind offered to be taxed exactly like oil and gas production (GPT in lieu of ad valorem). Rejected as unacceptable because it would amount to a tax cut! Even with your higher tax rate (still a discount off 7% GPT), new wind projects pay higher tax rate. #Math

8752 2018-04-06 19:29:19 100% but on top of that they built the jack ups thinking day rates would stay at ATH and then the oil price crashed. Double whammy for those guys, not quite undeserved...
8753 2018-04-06 19:28:54 Then why do we need to increase existing oil patch  production, to increase global carbon emissions all to put B.C.'s most precious resource, food provider, jobs provider, life provider...at risk? Increasing oil tanker shipments out of Westridge and through Metro Vancouver?
8754 2018-04-06 19:28:41 This would be more believable if he wasn't getting rid of EPA laws that protect farmers and their lands from development by oil companies mining corporations Etc. Trump is a liar and a con man. He's only in government to improve his own wealth. #Impeachtrump

8809 2018-04-06 19:22:08 the short answer is that alaskan residents own the rights to all of Alaskas resources and it was written into our state constitution that a portion of oil profits goes into an account and gets invested we then split a portion of the years profits. the account has done well

8844 2018-04-06 19:18:47 This concept applies to most arenas of study that need research from reputable groups. Some “new ideas”are just old snake oil repackaged under a different name. They’ve been around for 1,000’s of years, but people don’t have a historical context to recognize them.

8859 2018-04-06 19:17:18 Isn’t that the map the dick Cheney used on the very first cabinet meeting in 2001 on how they were going to divide up the oil for the companies?
8860 2018-04-06 19:17:15 Worked in oil and gas for over a decade. Process control networks were always firewalled from the corporate network. The level of unpatched systems on the PCNs was  so it was best they never were exposed to the corporate network.
8861 2018-04-06 19:16:53 No but it’s more important than fighting oil wars in the Middle East and trying to control foreign affairs w military threat
8862 2018-04-06 19:16:47 The former is impossible to disagree with unless you assume the U.K. haven’t used oil revenues. The latter admittedly is subject to disagreement
8863 2018-04-06 19:16:34 jus combine sugar, vitamin E or any other oils like almond oil or avocado oil and mix together. it will get off dead skin and leave ya skin feeling niceeeee

8867 2018-04-06 19:16:21 Joe: A Least Get Ready! Why hasn’t Ab NDP Govt passed necessary legislation to limit export (flow) of Oil Gas & Bitumen to BC. The mere act of having that “Legal” option would speak volumes.The growing momentum against a 2nd pipeline is helping BC NDP? Are Alberta NDP Bedfellows?

Once people realize you can rot down common autotrophic algae in  biodigesters to make natural gas & recycle the exhaust into more algae, it's done.

Conventional GTL tech turns NG to oil at $25/barrel.

8891 2018-04-06 19:13:28 Their revenues from oil was nothing compared to what the received taxing the regular people doing commerce. Says a lot....
8892 2018-04-06 19:13:24 You pulled that number straight out of your ass.  The oil companies routinely raise prices far more than the expected impact of carbon pricing on a litre of gasoline in Saskatchewan.

8918 2018-04-06 19:10:42 Why! Because war adds to the coffers of the rich, because we and almost every nation on earth have been battling for resources since the discovery oil.

8976 2018-04-06 19:04:11 Also, Trump and his cabinet are heavily invested in oil also. Neither Trump nor Putin has a great deal of control over oil prices. OPEC does. While neither wants the price depressed, Trump can't politically afford to have it spike either.

8992 2018-04-06 19:01:28 The Harper government spent that amount every year (some years up to $500,000!) to photograph cabinet ministers, lol! But it’s interesting that you think efforts to support and strengthen the oil and gas sector are a waste of money! So odd!

8997 2018-04-06 19:00:47 There are many ways to approach this depending on the policy context. That said the increase of contract disclosure has helped getting from speculation ("What deal was signed?") to more informed analysis & modeling work *much faster*.

9021 2018-04-06 18:59:00 Beware of thinking that this holy oil is ordinary oil and nothing else. After the invocation of the Spirit it is no longer ordinary oil but the gift of Christ, and by the presence of his divinity it becomes the instrument by which we receive the Spirit.

9033 2018-04-06 18:57:13 Well no wonder the prez likes Pruitt.  Besides taking care & doing the bidding of tRump’s biggest donors, the oil & gas companies, Pruitt just gets rid people who disagree w/him... just like tRump!
9034 2018-04-06 18:57:08 Part of me actually wants an oil spill on BC's coast.    If only to say 'we told you so' and then we get to shut the entire tarsands down.

9035 2018-04-06 18:57:03 Mineral oil because it breaks me out like no other. High alcohol contents in toners/setting sprays. Parabens cause I heard they’re bad so and coconut oil in skin care/face products cause it breaks me out. Great in hair/body care tho!
9036 2018-04-06 18:57:03 For Trump it's about reasserting US world leadership. Military doesn't count, because "taking the oil" or preemptive nuclear strikes aren't acceptable options. So trade "wars" are the next best thing, with some amount of fatalities on US side considered acceptable.

9040 2018-04-06 18:56:38 I was really problematic at drinking castor oil growing up,one day my grandma laced my nkomazi with it and gave it to me
9041 2018-04-06 18:56:32 Exactly. Food has an inelastic demand curve and a global market so it’ll have little impact. There’s no soybean cartel  to rig the world supply like oil. China has the weaker hand in this.
9042 2018-04-06 18:56:28 I don't see it on the natural gas side. China gassified without actually having the molecules to fill the distribution systems.  On oil, sure, that wouldn't hurt them much or U.S. exports much as that's a global system.  China would source elsewhere and U.S. would backfill.

9046 2018-04-06 18:56:03 Harry’s right. Come on, people. Forget the penny ante corruption and see the big picture. Pruitt is a sellout to Big Oil and the Kochs. That’s the story.
9047 2018-04-06 18:55:56 Big oil is as bad as NRA. Pruitt is their guy, ruthless crook. 
9048 2018-04-06 18:55:54 Pruitt used tax dollars for lavish private jets. Free condos from oil oligarchs. Gave illegal raises to his people. This is how republicans work, greed, take and lie. Republicans are giving taxpayers the middle finger. Pruitt, trump and republicans are above the law.

9050 2018-04-06 18:55:47 Coconut oil and lavender on the skin (just a few drops) has been helping my husband’s arm and lessening the pain, even.  He got diagnosed with shingles last week.
9051 2018-04-06 18:55:39 Funny how the answer to an oil and fuel leak in the army is to just bring spare oil and fuel with you. Like it just got out of the shop. For two weeks. And no one noticed. Okay.
9052 2018-04-06 18:55:36 Denatured alcohol (or any drying alcohol for that matter), fragrance (unless it’s one of the last ingredients), and ANY citrus oil or extract since those are phototoxic!!!
9053 2018-04-06 18:55:33 Minister, we produce about 4 million barrels/day of oil, we export almost 3 million bbl/day, we import some 900,000 bbl/day ... your plan should NOT 'carbon tax' oil/gas that is exported.  Y would u do that? If so, CO2 tax on oil/gas IMPORTS should apply
9054 2018-04-06 18:55:28 I think it’s been the weather making mine so brittle. Been using cuticle oil and lots of hand cream which is helping but I’ll try this Nail Envy next!
9055 2018-04-06 18:55:06 @realDonaldTrump You allowed the Oil Pipeline to cross the Lakota’s territory violated the Constitution’s Article 6 because of their treaties, are you leaving your violation in place or Repealing it, it IS Impeachable for violating your oath.

9058 2018-04-06 18:54:49 @PressSec claim that @EPAScottPruitt is “restoring @EPA to protect the environment” is an outright lie. More evidence that @realDonaldTrump admin purpose is to line its pockets with gas & oil deals @SecretaryZinke too, despite drastically harmful moves to the planet’s health.
9059 2018-04-06 18:54:40 Uneducated middle class. Educated middle class knew better. I consider myself the latter. tRump is and was a snake oil salesman. New Yorkers (his home state)knew it and did not vote for him. Stupid is as stupid does.

9064 2018-04-06 18:54:23 HaHaHa. Out in left field much? CDA req’s world prices for its exported oil, EE to reduce the need for imported blood oil, several new govt’s along with fewer strident radicals such as yourself. AND AB’s cancer/asthma rates r the lowest in CDA.

9081 2018-04-06 18:52:40 Taking a picture with him is hardly the same as lobbying for pro Russian oil interests in Ukraine while America is directly competing for that market. Still think it's BS to charge him with conspiracy
9082 2018-04-06 18:52:38 But Jonathan and his wife are still free. Touch them and threat of oil sabotage will follow.

9086 2018-04-06 18:52:16 Senator Cantwell,  are you referring to the liberals junk science theories. The earth's climate has never been stable. The reason we are able to drill for oil in places like Alaska is because at one time, tropical rain forests were there.

9090 2018-04-06 18:51:58 The oil industry cares not and power companies complain about the difficulties in a system where a lot of input can’t be relied upon.  Regardless, it sounds like you believe man-made AGW will destroy the world and I believe we’re entering a mini ice age. I hope you’re right.

9094 2018-04-06 18:51:48 It amazes me that people so willingly reject their best interests out of spite. No wonder this country has moved so far to the right that Nixon looks progressive.

9101 2018-04-06 18:50:41 The US is not reselling our oil.  They are further processing it like their own oil, often for domestic markets.  Some of our oil sent thru the Transmoutain Pipeline is further processed in the US and shipped back to BC as aviation fuel and gasoline.

9125 2018-04-06 18:47:57 On 2013, SK had record crop production...could not get it to market because the railways were hauling oil instead.

The oil company, Pertamina, said the spill came from their broken pipeline and admitted responsibility. Example of why pipelines are bad.

9261 2018-04-06 18:33:17 1/2 It’s good to know the issue of competitiveness for the oil & gas industry has finally made it on the government’s radar but they could’ve saved almost $300k by simply talking to Albertans involved in the industry! #aboli #cdnpoli #SenCA

9263 2018-04-06 18:32:46 I don't think the govt should do anything with DT. It has come out with a message about development.Only thing they can do is to bring oil into GST. Its a tough call bcz GST is decided by council. Until now it is unanimous but they can think of voting. It will help all section.

9295 2018-04-06 18:29:21 Do you segregate the petroleum streams to account for fractions going to plastics, & asphalt? I don't see worldwide refinery runs increasing that much, this tells me emissions from oil must be decreasing on a per barrel basis.
9296 2018-04-06 18:29:20 Any of you lovely people use CBD oil? Any recommendations and pros/cons?
9297 2018-04-06 18:29:19 as with You My President so with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt & all Your MAGA Team - GOD is your Covering, HE prepares a table before You in the presence of Your enemies; HE has anointed Your  head with oil; Your cup overflows.
9298 2018-04-06 18:29:18 You are wasting your firepower. Pruitt’s corruption is enormous, not because of this penny ante stuff but because he’s sold out, lock, stock and barrel to Big Oil and the Kochs. Go after the real corruption.

9310 2018-04-06 18:27:57 @sezekwesili the direct cause of soot in PH is flaring of gases by oil companies, the best solution is to inject the gas back into the ground, and the government has to be serious in insisting on zero percent gas flaring from all this oil companies.

9319 2018-04-06 18:27:15 So in order to stay in #Syria the #US is shuffling #ISIS around in Helos to different areas. As long as there are pockets of ISIS remaining the US can maintain their excuse to occupy 1/3 of Syria where the oil is.  One goal is to keep Syria cash starved. No oil no money!

9342 2018-04-06 18:25:10 My life is a constant cycle of sleeplessness, me discovering things that help for a bit, then sleeplessness again. Melatonin, valerian, lavender oil, special bedtime lotion, those little stuffed animals with the robot heartbeats, everything.

But still taken for granted
9345 2018-04-06 18:24:31 I'm sorry ur so scared! I've had several root canals & they're not that bad. The pain is quite manageable. Plus they can put u out for the procedure. I found that the pain subsided after 3 days & that Advil really helped as inflammation makes most of the pain. Clove oil also.
9346 2018-04-06 18:24:27 Oklahoma is a ruin because of a state AG owned by oil and gas. An area that knew no earthquakes now has hundreds because of fracking. Environmental Destruction Agency.
9347 2018-04-06 18:24:26 Don't forget that for the best looking great tasting fried food you should NEVER use palm oil. Its production is environmentally disastrous and consuming it can be bad for your health. Rapeseed oil or beef dripping are far better.

If you need more support shoot us an email- support@dosist.com & we can help.
9359 2018-04-06 18:23:24 Yes Please! like to see how those on Federal aid and govt. oil/farm subsidies, and everyone else in most red states will like their massive cuts in existence once the world's 7th largest economy stops paying its generous tax base share to support them. LOL.
9360 2018-04-06 18:23:17 Was it the drone war, maintaining the torture prison, or expanding the oil industry, do you think, that made us look better?

9364 2018-04-06 18:22:59 Recycling is a sham. The volume of addition pollution such as oil fuel etc involved in recycling far outweighs the benefits of it. Hell some of the stuff is sent to China to then sent back.

So I welcome you to lead the way by moving out of your penthouse business suite, cancelling your cable T.V. & internet connection, cancelling water/power services to your home & selling your Prius since all or most are powered by oil or coal.
9382 2018-04-06 18:21:21 Who said oil and coal are cheap? Neither are. Clean, decentralized energy is the cheapest option. But the oil industry and power company lobbyists don't like it, so legislators do what they can to support fossil fuels. You should know how that works.
9383 2018-04-06 18:21:19 Ladies, people often compliment me on my soft skin. My secret? Olive oil and sugar mixed together to form a scrub. Amazing! (You’re welcome)!

9388 2018-04-06 18:20:55 Ah, but that's just media bullshit. Its the next level to squirm.
A Major oil company declared they were a leader in safety.
At the time they had a SMS system based on 26 elements of audit, some easy (Policy) some a bit more (Accident Investigation), some obscure (HR System).
9389 2018-04-06 18:20:37 Every square kilometer was taken from someone who was already using it. I consider myself fortunate that when it got parceled out to my ancestors there was some oil. If they'd gone to Quebec I might have got asbestos.

9391 2018-04-06 18:20:32 The @SenateGOP confirmed @EPAScottPruitt and is complicit in destroying the @EPA as a favor to the oil and gas industry. Payback will be in the form of lucrative cushy jobs once they are voted out in 2018. #Corruption runs deep in our #Kleptocracy.

9393 2018-04-06 18:20:12 Pruitt is an oil executive with an office in the white house. He works for putin/Rosneft and Exxon! We pay part of his salary and supply his office and his security. He needs sound proof room to work on his oil deals!
9394 2018-04-06 18:20:09 I don't even know if my body could handle all that oil but man I'm tempted
9395 2018-04-06 18:20:06 tea tree oil, eucalyptus and Vick’s  they all have a pretty similar smell
9396 2018-04-06 18:19:55 So what you are trying to say is Venezuela is a shit  hole banana republic that was only able to survive its toxic socialists policies due to inflated oil prices. Once it one and only commodity went down it also fell like a house of cards. Do I have that right?

9406 2018-04-06 18:18:37 This time around I'm gon make sure love and hurt don't mix like oil and milk.
9407 2018-04-06 18:18:24 y’all remember Lorenzo’s Oil???
9408 2018-04-06 18:18:22 And he missed the birdie putt. Come on. Just have to convert those opportunities, especially on a day when the other top guys are leaking oil all over the track.
9409 2018-04-06 18:18:18 Scott Pruitt will only look out for himself. Unless big oil calls his name! He’s been owned by big oil since his #OKAG days. Still the same, I don’t see any difference
9410 2018-04-06 18:18:15 Chef Kawasaki cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with sushi.
9411 2018-04-06 18:18:15 And that long term, finding ways to make those things work is far more exportable than getting 20-40 years of oil sands profits.
9412 2018-04-06 18:18:11 Sure it does, what it doesn't depend on is the lies that surround it... oil is dead stuff we have plenty of that.  Also living stuff (plants, bugs) eat it and while we should be carful with it we shouldn't be over reacting to clean it up just collect what we can and move on.
9413 2018-04-06 18:18:05 Quebec like the rest of Canada gets most of the oil it imports from the United States. But you're likely referring to Saudi Arabia where we got about 9% of our oil in 2015. So shady that both Mr Harper and Mr Trudeau decided to sell them arms.
9414 2018-04-06 18:17:54 Please consider my request. I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? Thank you. #ProtectAntarctic

9417 2018-04-06 18:17:48 I remember during my master's how the business library always had these stupid business magazines on display. They had the dumbest covers, like "Data Is the New Oil"

9421 2018-04-06 18:17:23 Hey Dolt 45, in what bizzaro world is @ScottPruittOK doing a good job? He doesn’t care about protecting the environment. He’ll sell it for whatever he can get from big oil - hell, I bet he would sell his wife if he could! Anything for a dollar...
9422 2018-04-06 18:17:18 Why is olive oil extra virgin?
9423 2018-04-06 18:17:14 the pricetag notwithstanding. rex, you know that people need to see data to believe anything. 

if JT stood up & referenced oil prices and the trump effect (opening up the spigots w/ no care for the environment), cons like you would shriek: “where’s the proof”?
9424 2018-04-06 18:17:13 Yes, while I was waiting for my oil change. She was on the phone for at least an hour. Ugh!
9425 2018-04-06 18:17:11 @UmaruSanda my position is that if America want to offer us training they should train us how to extract our oil and make cars.#citinewsroom

9427 2018-04-06 18:16:55 my fave way is to take most of the stems out, douse it with olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic, then roast it for 10-12 mins at 325. til it's slightly crunchy, but not brown.
9428 2018-04-06 18:16:41 Me too... 

When it holds on, IT HOLDS ON TIGHT. 

And 
You don't like short ppl ? Don't change your oil 
9429 2018-04-06 18:16:36 I would say limiting fruit & promoting olive oil, fish, eating animal foods from age +65.
9430 2018-04-06 18:16:22 Oil was okay when I came back from the track day. Now it appears I have gone below the low limit  I see why they recommend changing it every 3 months  jesus does it drink it!
9431 2018-04-06 18:16:19 @petrogustavo, los propuesto de GP es bien pensado, no depender del oil y carbón. Colombiano debe mirar el Campo allí esta la riqueza e industrialización.

9433 2018-04-06 18:16:15 I will tell you guys something. During 1990s Gudiwada - Bhimavaram road was expanded via Mudinepalli, Singarayapalem, Korukollu. My Village is near Singarayapalem. Today, Singarayapalem and Korukollu road was industrialized a lot with Fish, Prawn based &expecting a Oil refinery.
9434 2018-04-06 18:16:10 #GasPrices will likely slow down in some places over the next few days with the national average dropping slightly over the next 3-5 days as oil prices slump over concerns of a China/US trade war.
9435 2018-04-06 18:16:05 Our 6th grade students in Ms. Seifert's science class simulated the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon Oil Spills.  Our students experimented to see how we can separate the oil from the water to save ecosystems and the organisms that live there.

9438 2018-04-06 18:15:44 Exactly! Well said, brother!  Pruitt is an Oil & Gas industry surrogate.  Also, IMHO the devil incarnate
9439 2018-04-06 18:15:42 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
9440 2018-04-06 18:15:39 Nothing says environmental protection like huge container ships full of oil!
9441 2018-04-06 18:15:35 No I was not. Wanted to genuinely hear the reasons and as usual, got bombarded with hate against oil, then hate because of my name. NBD.

9444 2018-04-06 18:15:13 Testy, testy. Sherman Anti Trust act? 1911 Standard Oil?
9445 2018-04-06 18:14:46 The world remains dependent on fossil fuels because there's no economic alternative. Eventually the cost of oil and gas will rise, renewables and nuclear improve, and the market forces a gradual change. It's unlikely that CO2 concentration will exceed 630 ppm

9472 2018-04-06 18:11:23 Que buys their oil and lots of it from some real shady places. No one want asbestos
9473 2018-04-06 18:11:19 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
9474 2018-04-06 18:11:18 Because Pruitt is catering to the oil folks and they pay the bills for Republican candidates
9475 2018-04-06 18:11:16 U.S. announcing new Russian sanctions. Good move. If we put sanctions on Russian oil and nat gas they will suffer severely. Can we put sanctions on Mexico while we at it? Ha!

Why?
So the middle class buys more oil. How is that conservative?

9490 2018-04-06 18:09:44 Oh yes, with a little bit of olive oil and salt rubbed on the skin, prior to the oven.
9491 2018-04-06 18:09:40 This is very sad news. We should maximize fuel economy to save consumers and protect our environment. Let the oil companies make their own money without @GOP help
9492 2018-04-06 18:09:39 Parang gusto ko ng Mang Inasal, unlimited rice, tapos yung chicken oil  Ughh!
9493 2018-04-06 18:09:37 ROTFLMBO! You really think America isn't corrupt going around the globe destroying entire nations, murdering men, women and children for oil and other resources? American imperialism will bring us down to our knees eventually.
9494 2018-04-06 18:09:36 *** sigh *** They are saying there are reports that the idea was floated last week. If you are an oil or energy company, of course you would love Scott Pruitt. Unfortunately, he is the head of the Environmental PROTECTION Agency. So, not doing a great job and corrupt as hell.

9498 2018-04-06 18:09:13 Change of plans. Not waiting 2 hours to change oil. Back home doing laundry. Worked called asked if I wanted to come in. Um...NO!!!
9499 2018-04-06 18:08:57 Starting out calling someone “you people” isn’t PC any longer. Like I said to MC before he lost his composure on twitter. We still have wild game (animals like deer) that we enjoy eating. Walmart also sells underwear and outdoor grills. They’ll change oil too. Oh the humanity....
9500 2018-04-06 18:08:57 Mmm tea tree oil and it's benefits 
9501 2018-04-06 18:08:54 you are leaving oil ?
9502 2018-04-06 18:08:53 Paa kalau si olif oil naka gebugin aja pa
9503 2018-04-06 18:08:44 Yep, we're deficient the rare minerals mining and production capabilities the same as we are short on oil refineries for domestic petroleum. @ENERGY @EnergySecMoniz @POTUS
9504 2018-04-06 18:08:43 Getting my oil changed, and the front desk lady tells me I look like Mario from Saved by the Bell. I'll take that as a compliment.

9508 2018-04-06 18:08:15 Yes to castor oil! I've heard biotin can cause acne but that could be wrong. A 'womens' multivitamin might be better for hair growth.
9509 2018-04-06 18:08:14 The saddest moment is whenever I ran out of oil 
9510 2018-04-06 18:08:01 like a couple days ago my mum threw water on the chip pan with the oil still in it when it was outside on fire and a MASSIVE burst of flames came up almost burning my mum cause y'know don't put water on oil kids and you know the first thing my mum said when she came back inside?

9513 2018-04-06 18:07:54 Bought this new coconut body oil and it smells like chocolate... I fucking hate chocolate. 
9514 2018-04-06 18:07:47 Try diffusing some lavender oil. Or I make a roller ball blend sometimes of doterra oils. I use 5 drops lavender, 5 drops balance, 5 drops frankincense, then I fill the rest of the bottle with fractionated coconut oil (can buy off amazon). Rub on temples, behind ears, & wrists!
9515 2018-04-06 18:07:46 Things have improved a lot.. but Sask needs to move more and more in this direction.  I want more gov't policies that promote high tech and knowledge-based industries.  We can't just drill for oil forever.

9518 2018-04-06 18:07:20 So you think these are apples and apples. He went to steel plants in a panic as some ridings are at stake, including mine, he has said in the past oil should stay in the ground and he's effectively cancelled 2 major pipelines while not applying the same standards to oil imports.
9519 2018-04-06 18:07:12 Crude #Oil prices have dropped this week, why are we note seeing it at the pumps? Refining costs can run 5 cents to 15 cents per gallon more for the summer blend but that is already added in the price. this next week we should see pump prices Fall. #gasprices @business
9520 2018-04-06 18:06:48 Tough spot. We got oil when we stole Alberta from the original inhabitants, and Quebec got asbestos. And the world has decided it doesn't want as much of either of them. Quebec has moved along from asbestos. We can move along from whining.
9521 2018-04-06 18:06:45 Doctors know shockingly little about current nutrition research. My own doc recommended I eat more vegetable oil (which is high in omega 6 and unhealthy mostly). He also said that fruit juice is very healthy. It's basically pure sugar ... it's healthier to just eat the fruit. x3

9523 2018-04-06 18:06:32 3 in 1 ... clock oil, beater bike oil, bitcoin miner oil. Got all 3 covered!
9524 2018-04-06 18:06:27 Learning to control my emotions in and out of the gym is paying off.

I’ve been waiting for 2+ hours on an oil change, they lost the key. Could of gotten mad at them. Remained calm, and compensated me for close too $250 worth of work.
 
Positivity and a smile works tremendously.
9525 2018-04-06 18:06:22 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

9530 2018-04-06 18:05:38 Went to his Town Hall last year.  He's all about oil and guns.  Doesn't listen to constituents, but accuses us of "not listening".  I wound up in his district after gerrymandering.  We want our Dem back!  @ColinAllredTX  will be a much needed improvement.

9544 2018-04-06 18:04:24 That was the point of #GOP #fortyfive ignoring it... It's not filled with oil executives and ex-presidents like Texas (where the other hurricane was)...It is an act of supremacy to let it wilt and falter. #resist

9556 2018-04-06 18:03:01 Food for thought:
Around 70 percent of the world's soy is fed directly to livestock and only six percent of soy is turned into human food, which is mostly consumed in Asia. The rest of soy is turned into soybean oil.

9561 2018-04-06 18:02:37 Obama didn't create jobs, he lost them. The only reason the unemployment numbers fell is because people stopped looking for work and were no longer counted. Yhe only real job growth was in the oil industry due to fraking which Obama opposed.

9616 2018-04-06 17:56:07 Oil ($/CL) off another 2.5% after this week's U.S. rig count topped 800 for the first time in over three years. Crude failed to break through a key $66.66 ceiling in late March and has continued to falter ever since in response to further tariff concerns.

9637 2018-04-06 17:53:34 Perhaps to destabilise the political situation even more here? Does anyone monitor the price of oil and gold? A few people profit massively from geopolitical shifts, especially if you know what's going to happen first. Disaster capitalism breeds these kind of actions

9657 2018-04-06 17:51:27 IMO the US has horribly abused the oil capital monopoly it has held and deserves to lose it. I say this as an American who has benefited from that monopoly and who would be hurt by its loss.
9658 2018-04-06 17:51:22 To be be clear, I did not mean that *you* are calling for neoliberal policies. What I am saying is that Putin's economic policies contradict to his own growth plans, and this will, of course, negatively affect the situation with Russia's dependence on oil you wrote about.

9661 2018-04-06 17:51:11 the whitepaper indicates that it is backed by the price of oil and some calculation based on a 200 million barrels reserve but since the formula has variables that are defined by the government the answer is whatever # they want to back their #scam with.
9662 2018-04-06 17:51:00 It's had lots of research in Canada USA and Australia. You just need to check out the users of the CBD oil and their testimonies.

9664 2018-04-06 17:50:47 There are many oil producing countries that are in far better economic shape than Venezuela. Chavez and Maduro created that cesspool.
9665 2018-04-06 17:50:41 there's a great scene in the new Getty series when Getty Senior is explaining to Getty Grandson how the company shifts the money so the oil business appears to be operating at a loss! 

no longer insider info! 
9666 2018-04-06 17:50:38 Similarly, after the #DeepwaterHorizon Gulf of Mexico oil catastrophe, didn’t BP claim they could make everyone stay away from pretty much any water or land the oil touched?

9673 2018-04-06 17:49:51 Well I hope when ya’ll start shipping oil overseas you also stop discounting it to the US.. as a foreign market why would I pay top dollar for something that you’re practically giving away to someone else... ? What am I missing?

9675 2018-04-06 17:49:34 Population and demand increases everywhere. WA has 95% renewable (Texas 2.5%), and WA often has lower electricity rates.

Texas had big government subsidies for oil, gas and wind by the way, which is why there was a push in that direction. Government subsidies, not free market.

9679 2018-04-06 17:49:01 Great article.  "Eat Good LOCAL meat and produce" would be the best model.  How much of global warming is due to transportation of food enabled by cheap oil.   Richard Manning's "how agriculture hijacked culture" speaks to local grasses vs destructive agriculture of wheat,corn.

9683 2018-04-06 17:48:32 Yes.  Apparently they're still not Legal Tender in England.  They would probably rather accept Euros or bloody Sheckels or something.  It's terrible being the poor relations especially when you come from the Oil Capital of Europe.
9684 2018-04-06 17:48:02 I'm not an economist, and you're using a straw man argument because I'm not arguing for neoliberal reforms. I'm saying that within the present political-economic system, oil rents are the single most important source of state resources for social and military spending.

9688 2018-04-06 17:47:11 Yes. It changed my life. 
The day after Boxing Day I could no longer walk I was in such pain. 
For weeks I was unable to walk without an aid. By February I'd almost given up that I'd never dance again by chance I heard about CBD oil when I joined a cronic pain group. I'm dancing!

9691 2018-04-06 17:46:57 Mr. Scott Pruitt is going nowhere. And is welcome to stay as long as he can stand it. A few weeks of Pruitt at EPA is worth $1-billion or so in aggravation relief to the oil and gas industry. He really doesn't give a shit what others think. Nor should he.
9692 2018-04-06 17:46:48 Trump wants the "protections" gone in order for his "oil buddies" to reap the rewards of having no protections, including Putin who's losing billions.

9700 2018-04-06 17:46:00 People in Quebec work just as hard as we do. They didn't have the opportunity to steal a large amount of oil from indigenous people, as Albertans did. Are you in the oil industry?

9709 2018-04-06 17:44:13 My good man! Have you ever tried a wonderful little trick I like to call CBD oil? : ) It may or may not help with pain, but it sure does help with depression, insomnia, and the occasional dark mood. It has worked wonders for me, and I wanna pass on the love 
9710 2018-04-06 17:44:04 Well yea it is proven climate changed has been happening since day 1.  Long before man started burning oil. Just pay your carbon tax and it will be ok.  lol
9711 2018-04-06 17:44:04 Okay, that’s good to know, thanks! My understanding is that capsaicin is oil based, so that should be helpful!

In any case, it seems to have finally worn off overnight uwu
9712 2018-04-06 17:43:50 Oh, I know you’ll let me play it if I want. Your good about that.

9777 2018-04-06 17:35:15 Oil is the answer!
9778 2018-04-06 17:35:12 resentment is such an ugly and dark feeling.... black and thick like oil .. heavy and sticky like tar ...
9779 2018-04-06 17:35:01 .

Data isn’t the new oil, attention is. So expensive.
9780 2018-04-06 17:34:51 Oil is the correct answer Nate
9781 2018-04-06 17:34:38 no better feeling than freshly shaved legs w coconut oil 
9782 2018-04-06 17:34:25 Those decisions are made by the folks that think they have the votes behind them to support their decisions. Unfortunately, a lot of Canadians think this is just about a pipeline and not about shipping 7 times more oil through BC waters by oil tanker. #cdnpoli #bcpoli
9783 2018-04-06 17:34:14 coconut oil is bae
9784 2018-04-06 17:34:11 Bruh coconut oil is really the holy grail for everything
9785 2018-04-06 17:34:02 If big oil didn’t do everything they can to stop clean energy, there wouldn’t be a problem.

9787 2018-04-06 17:33:37 fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical

of rock oil.
9788 2018-04-06 17:33:36 I just got drawn into a story about where Mandy Moore slathers coconut oil (nowhere exciting).
9789 2018-04-06 17:33:22 Trump friends are mobsters and anyone laundering Rubles his way, ie, the #NRA. Of course he thinks oligarch #Scott Pruitt is doing a good job - for big oil, the Kochs, and all Corp CEOs who want to pollute the air you breathe, the one earth u have. #WakeUpAmerica

9812 2018-04-06 17:29:46 I wish things like that would never happen but it is still the safest way to transport oil. The best of all evils I guess. Hope all is well Melida!
9813 2018-04-06 17:29:45 I do a lot with scents- candles, oils, etc. Peppermint oil balls are a godsend. Whenever I have a rough day, I burn candles while I work.

9827 2018-04-06 17:29:16 Only if the pipelines go south. Pipelines giving access to other markets would reduce supply to the USA and increase the currently discounted price. USA benefits wildly from Canada’s landlocked oil. Why do you think they support anti-pipeline enviro groups?
9828 2018-04-06 17:29:14 I had an emotional breakdown this morning and i think my mom felt bad for me so she told me to go buy an oil diffuser and you better believe i did. We have a shopping problem.

بموتتت هيتشول يقول ااحبب oil 
9855 2018-04-06 17:28:17 From what I understand it’s oil.
9856 2018-04-06 17:28:17 and of course City are totally self sufficient, and making large profits. So no need for oil money.
9857 2018-04-06 17:28:09 New research suggests that the chemicals contained in essential oils such as lavender oil and tea tree oil may disrupt the normal functioning of hormones, leading to a condition called male gynecomastia in prepubescent boys.
9858 2018-04-06 17:27:57 Hot coconut oil treatment on the locks 
9859 2018-04-06 17:27:54 yep; hard to have meltdown with 2% yields and all the oil and natty gas you could ever dream of
9860 2018-04-06 17:27:50 You’re the slave, yegg. You’re an unwitting snake oil salesman for Alex Jones.
9861 2018-04-06 17:27:42 So do Canadian citizens. we want much better disclosure and no back room hushed nda deals with big oil or gas! WE have the right to know (kinder morgan) and can easily persuade at the polls. You are a reasonable woman. Fight for us.
9862 2018-04-06 17:27:39 Khan Sheikhoun "gas attack" was a set up by Western backed terrorists. US wants Syrian oil/power. We will not rest until all the world knows
9863 2018-04-06 17:27:15 The price of oil fell, and that had nothing to do with the party that was in power at the time (hint: not the NDP).
9864 2018-04-06 17:27:12 Somehow some people tend to forget that Erdogan was an ally to Gülen and his family happily traded oil with ISIS, while Turkey at the moment "only" support other terrorists/mercenaries - just to bring "national unity" - ei: Keep Erdogan in power.
9865 2018-04-06 17:27:08 Some thoughts:
Putin is sitting on $90b of oil;
Pruitt goes along with car manufacturers to lower emission restrictions;
Lifts sanctions on oil pipe line;
Works to ruin environment in favor of oil producers;
Trump in bed with Putin.
Any dots to connect here?

9868 2018-04-06 17:26:41 U.S. Rig Count is up 10  rigs from last week to 1,003, with oil rigs up 11 to 808, gas rigs  unchanged at 194, and miscellaneous rigs down 1 to 1

9870 2018-04-06 17:26:36 Luv has no age limit, Mandela was no blesser coz his intentions was to marry Winnie, so don't mix water with oil.
9871 2018-04-06 17:26:34 Poor Trudeau. On one side, no pipelines on the other not enough pipelines.  Meanwhile googling massive new oil discovery brings results from all over the world, so new pipelines would only feed glut.  Time to think outside the boat and use our oil to our best advantage.
9872 2018-04-06 17:26:32 First 24 hours on my CBD vaping oil...
9873 2018-04-06 17:26:32 When girls tweet about how proudly they changed their Gen oil... *I laugh in generator mechanic mode*
9874 2018-04-06 17:26:14 Wind made $37 BILLION more than oil & gas in OK in 2016. The year before they only paid $8.3 MILLION in state taxes, while oil & gas paid $2.5 BILLION.

Wind needs to pay its fair share. They don't deserve that huge of tax cuts!
9875 2018-04-06 17:26:00 I see you’re a Saraki crybaby. He gives you 2kg rice and 1 liter oil every year hence the cry for this years own. Cry on.
9876 2018-04-06 17:25:53 Oil people problems
9877 2018-04-06 17:25:41 Oil prices fell at European close on Friday to cap off an overall bearish week. Downwards sentiment this week has been largely driven by fears of increasing trade tensions between the U.S and China, and today the same factor continued to drag prices down.

9880 2018-04-06 17:25:09 There is more profit in moving oil and other products than there is in moving grain. That's why back log was not being moved until they get pressure to do so. That is the reason no matter how CN and CP want to spin it.

9920 2018-04-06 17:21:17 There’s also an essential oil called Benzoe and smelling it helps a lot. I usually put a few drops on a facial tissue and lay it next to my pillow overnight and I also made a roll-on to put it under my nose so I can smell it when I’m out and about :)

9934 2018-04-06 17:19:19 Wow! Somebody is kidding themselves. The most corrupt admin actually left the White House a little over a year ago. How many Democrat politicians have made tens of millions investing in the very same oil companies they simultaneously demonize? The ultimate hypocrites.
9935 2018-04-06 17:19:15 If the oil industry is freed from the RFS will gas prices go down? Grassley made a point of saying the refiners pass along the RIN expenses to their customers.  Along with saying all of us non farmers are just a bunch of drunk womanizers. If you get rid of it you have my vote.
9936 2018-04-06 17:19:07 Peanut oil is probably better, due to a higher smoke point. Good to see Brantley back tho!!

9976 2018-04-06 17:14:07 I’m often asked about fuel profitability compared to car washing. Many have heard me call fuel our “loss leader” - it’s all just to wash more cars. Most oil companies are very shortsighted, with a few starting to get it.
9977 2018-04-06 17:13:55 It's good for business. A lot of natural resources to explore. Great for selling arms and weapons. Controlling the price of oil. Israel doesn't have to worry about Syria. A great ally of the Palestinians and recognizes the Zionist state as the threat to peace that it is.
