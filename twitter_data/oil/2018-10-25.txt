2 2018-10-25 23:59:23 Everything about you is heartless. And brainless. Your MAGA cap is on too tight. No more time for this foolishness. Off to listen to some Midnight Oil. Bet you love that!
3 2018-10-25 23:59:14 Anybody able to plug me into thc oil
4 2018-10-25 23:59:08 I put simpson oil in my pancakes this morning and I am STILL stoned
5 2018-10-25 23:59:03 I didn’t eat a lot of butter and red meats like people do. I got my fats from avocados, olive oil, nuts and seeds and didn’t cut them out completely. I just didn’t eat bread and other stuff that hurt my body.
6 2018-10-25 23:58:58 For your yard? Diatomaceous earth. Inside your house, a few drops of peppermint oil in water in a spray bottle. Spray all along baseboards and windows or doors!
7 2018-10-25 23:58:56 911 was by 15 Saudi national high jackers. 

The US is now the largest oil producer. 

Why do you think MBS disciplined and seized assets of 20 princes fomenting terrorism throughout the world?

Pay for play politicians in the US are on notice. 

AMERICAN voters have had enough.

9 2018-10-25 23:58:34 I was thinking if I push a cork under. The volume displacement would make the water higher and the pressure more compared to that depth before the cork. Same while the oil droplets are suspended under, yes?
10 2018-10-25 23:58:26 Black Cumin Seed Oil Ma I swear that’s all u will ever need or shea butter.
11 2018-10-25 23:57:58 Absolutely! My dad coached our softball team, lived in the south were being an "oil slicker" meant u had great $ and future, I had easy pick of jobs at 14, all kids would play in the neighborhood until the sun went down (no supervision required) and trick-or-treating was SAFE!
12 2018-10-25 23:57:23 Real and fake don't mix like water and oil
13 2018-10-25 23:57:06 if we developed oil on the pace USA and Russia are today we would build 2 major pipelines to each coast and open business to the rest of the globe...not $28 oil only to USA... we'd cover healthcare, mental care, farmacare, and double old age pensions while paying out nation debit

39 2018-10-25 23:56:31 Donald Trump enjoys his role as snake oil salesman more than being a President, as long as he can stand before an audience rant and lie, basically destroy our peace of mind, and act like he gives a damn about human life
40 2018-10-25 23:56:26 Found my oil leak on bobcat. Geting ready for winter again.
41 2018-10-25 23:56:09 I don’t know if you’re allowed to use it, but CBD oil has done wonders for my back. I tore a muscle back in July and it’s the only thing that’s helped my muscle pain.
42 2018-10-25 23:56:08 @Jentezen @jaketapper  Snake oil from Franklin.
43 2018-10-25 23:55:44 Other things you can try: warm compresses on the back of your neck (using peppermint oil or eucalyptus on it can help decongest), menthol lozenges, peppermint or lemon tea with honey. Warm compresses on your face can help with decongestion/pain also
44 2018-10-25 23:55:19 I'm pretty sure it's a "snapshot" question. The moment before a shaking with clear layers, & the moment you set the bottle down after shaking with suspended bubbles. In that moment & a bit following, until the oil is all on top again, the pressure on the bottom is a bit higher.
45 2018-10-25 23:55:18 Clove oil is really killing me rn 
46 2018-10-25 23:55:12 I do not understand why such a rich country in Oil/labor forceHave the nerve to expectto feel sorry for Mexicwhen you can’t understand basic Math
47 2018-10-25 23:55:00 Make great recipes with “Partanna Extra Virgin Olive Oil began! This oil went on to become the very first Asaro family olive oil to be sold in the United States.
48 2018-10-25 23:54:50 (travels with 2 entire rig setups and oil pen in my carry on)

TSA: says nothing

49 2018-10-25 23:54:10 Don’t forget, the vitamin c cream WILL tingle/burn when you put it on but use the oil and moisturizer on top and it’ll stop.
50 2018-10-25 23:53:57 This is not a medical diagnosis, but it can refer to fatty liver buildup. The liver can be regenerated with Nigella sativa oil. LOTS of Magnesium Chloride will dissolve calcium formations (gallstones in your cases) when consumed orally and applied topically over the organs

53 2018-10-25 23:53:13 Bert chuckled and nodded.  He pat Deb several times, going over that oil to make sure the mark's stayed, and ignoring the hair.  He likely had Smokey's black fur all over him too regardless.

"He's got a real nice voice yeah.  I think i heard that name before somewhere…"
54 2018-10-25 23:53:03 70 bucks for a oil change. 
55 2018-10-25 23:52:44 Soak in warm water at least 10 mins, dry, coat in coconut oil. Apply gloves if possible.
56 2018-10-25 23:52:40 Yea wright, like Trump never had sex with Stormy, he was just checking oil level inside Stormy’s belly.
57 2018-10-25 23:52:38 It's all mixing like oil and water.

59 2018-10-25 23:52:17 It depends on the tone of the video. "Brought to you by big oil! Powering humanity" is different than "Going green! This is the future of our planet" or even "Paid for by a silent partner"!
60 2018-10-25 23:51:52 Gas down 30 cents here on FL east coast....

Oh yea an election about to happen so oil and @gop want to show how much they care about ....

BS!!!!
61 2018-10-25 23:51:43 @rhettmc @linklamont @StevieWLevine can y’all do another leaving stuff in _____ with a more viscous substance? Perhaps yogurt, face wash or olive oil would work!

63 2018-10-25 23:51:29 Essential Oil Peeps: Do you have any info regarding use with casting?
64 2018-10-25 23:51:28 Artificially manipulating your biochemistry with synthetic drugs and removing organs via invasive surgical procedures is just one facet of medicine. And a highly limited narrow-sighted one at that. What makes you think natural disciplines of medicine are "mostly snake oil."
65 2018-10-25 23:51:21 We used oil lamps at table
66 2018-10-25 23:51:16 Why did oil companies give u so much money? #specialinterestlackey
67 2018-10-25 23:50:42 The wars over oil are far from over because of China, India, and other developing countries that need it.
68 2018-10-25 23:50:25 I definitely won’t rely on a bunch of cherry picking oil industry professionals who suffer from a severe case of cognitive dissonance.
69 2018-10-25 23:50:22 I’m trying my damnedest because I feel like two nights isn’t that long. But man, it means no snail serum, no face oil, no cleansing oil, no kale sleeping mask ...
70 2018-10-25 23:50:14 Don’t you dare waste that oil, I’ve been running low for years!
71 2018-10-25 23:50:12 I was trying wait till next week and get my oil changed but my light just came on blinking and I’m spook lol
72 2018-10-25 23:50:08 Transfers and heavy taxes per transfer and no fuel no sugar no oil 

Importing

75 2018-10-25 23:49:50 I gotta get a oil change tomorrow
76 2018-10-25 23:49:48 @UB_speakers 
If the GOP & conservative media relentlessly call Democrats "socialists" no matter how much Dems cozy up to big oil, big pharma, banks military contractors & wars, then why not just decide to return to the party of FDR & just OWN the word socialist & just do it?

80 2018-10-25 23:49:09 Went to the Valvoline on Reseda and got 20% off my oil change for showing my CSUN ID. Am I the only person who didn’t know about this discount before???
81 2018-10-25 23:49:05 "We suggest storing Crisco shortening on the pantry shelf. If you live in a warm climate and prefer to refrigerate shortening and oil, keep in mind that refrigeration causes shortening to be more firm and oils to be thicker and look somewhat cloudy."
82 2018-10-25 23:48:55 The oil economy as such must be called in question. It is apparently not enough any more to draw attention to the harm that's done – this needs real, physical power, I guess.

92 2018-10-25 23:47:29 Well it's a 100 year old fight with us

Mean while oil companys tax dollars form there record profits are paying for power stations for electric cars in big cities

93 2018-10-25 23:47:19 Canada's major oil and gas companies supported a carbon pricing mechanism (evenly applied to all carbon emitting companies) long before Notley became Premier of Alberta

95 2018-10-25 23:46:36 Germany is already up to 35% clean energy for their whole country. It is an achievable goal. But there is too many who still want to make big bucks on fossil fuels. We must keep fighting for this. Oil is a thing of the past.
96 2018-10-25 23:46:16 The resurgence of oil going back to 100+ a barrel. Do you need more facts?

101 2018-10-25 23:45:31 My wife was diagnosed stage 3 breast cancer last year..a week after our first born, i always wondered about deodorants, shampoos, soap..etc...we are much more "organic" conscious these days...on a side note: CBD oil will get you through anything

104 2018-10-25 23:45:06 That seems really short-sighted. Naturopathy is mostly snake oil, but there is some validity when used in conjunction with other methods. It just takes patient research. And conventional medicine has given me plenty of useful answers, and they continue to look and find for more.
105 2018-10-25 23:44:47 Indonesian & Malaysian Govt's hand out logging concessions like confetti to mates & rellies. They all get rich. They replant hardwood with fast growing palm oil plants. Whole ecosystems/habitats destroyed. Tragedy.

108 2018-10-25 23:44:01 Up until now, Tommy Ricketts Arena heated resurfacing water to 160F using almost 6,000 litres of heating oil per season. #REALiceCA enables operations to eliminate oil as a heating source. Further savings derive from resetting the brine temperature 3F - 5F warmer. #sustainability
109 2018-10-25 23:43:54 That's not oil my dears . . .*wink*
110 2018-10-25 23:43:49 Corporations... well I despise them too and agree they have far too much negative influence on the environment. But so does the government. For example here in New Zealand the government completely banned oil and gas exploration, which studies have shown in addition to wrecking
111 2018-10-25 23:43:44 Most of the oil departing this month for China isn’t heading to Dalian, but to three other ports.
112 2018-10-25 23:43:35 OMFG I almost just put my homemade essential oil and baking soda carpet cleaner in my Alfredo to thicken the sauce instead of flour rip almost
113 2018-10-25 23:43:32 I tagged on fine as did many others, I didn't have the hear to ask what the fuck was going on, all grinny oil n gas types
114 2018-10-25 23:43:30 Have you tried CBD oil?
115 2018-10-25 23:43:29 I’m not organic. Perhaps vitamin e oil.
116 2018-10-25 23:43:24 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
117 2018-10-25 23:43:18 If the pressure on an object would go up, why wouldn't the pressure on the bottom also go up? There is a new buoyant force pushing up on the oil that is now inside the water. The water is being pushed down by the oil. Being pushed down onto the bottom of the container.
118 2018-10-25 23:43:17 I'm so tired of doing my hair and my hair needs an oil treatment for like 2 weeks

122 2018-10-25 23:43:01 Also, the wars for oil are over. America is the #1 producer of oil in the world now.
123 2018-10-25 23:42:47 Nah you ever had fish oil in a capsule ????
124 2018-10-25 23:42:40 My flu jab isn't fully effective for 7 days so if even so much as sniffles near me I'll douse them in olbas oil & see if I can set light to them!!
125 2018-10-25 23:42:04 As detailed in the Oil Fall series: In 2017, China generated 394 TWh of electricity from wind and solar alone. But converting the first 1/10th of its vehicle fleet to run as EV would require just 43 TWh per year. Looking ahead, the *rate* at which China is building...

Oil continued higher after its recents lows, and iron ore, unlike stocks, is in a bull market

133 2018-10-25 23:40:39 The Sox really had no bullpen to speak of.  The Mets' bullpen was much, much better.  The Sox needed great, long outings from their starters.  And after Clemens and Hurst, they had crazy Oil Can Boyd and deeply mediocre Al Nipper.

143 2018-10-25 23:39:31 I am now out of olive oil. I can't remember the last time that happened.
144 2018-10-25 23:39:29 Just say it Andrew. You mean oil projects. Cat got your tongue? #hotairscheer
145 2018-10-25 23:39:26 If you don’t buy Olive Oil in a can you aren’t Italian. End of story.
146 2018-10-25 23:39:25 @LawsNation @VochLombardi Calling it now, Dallas will sign Obi Melifonwu and trade Jourdan Lewis. Lewis and Chris Richards seems to be more like water and oil! +=

149 2018-10-25 23:38:34 Any tips on relieving a really really bloated & painful tummy. Tried peppermint oil, heat pad & few other things but just seems to be getting worse.

151 2018-10-25 23:38:19 Talk about false flags. This guy probably gives Trumpy oil massages.
152 2018-10-25 23:38:18 “I will not declare war on a neighbour. I will not allow the installation of American military bases here. The United States is not fond of democracy in the world. Their focus is oil.” – Brazilian Presidential Candidate Fernando Haddad.  #HaddadEManu
153 2018-10-25 23:38:05 "It's a private company."
The argument didn't work for Gulf Shipbuilding Co. It didn't work for southern diners. It didn't work for Ma Bell. It didn't work for Standard Oil.
154 2018-10-25 23:37:49 Come thru for an oil change and bring me food dawgs
155 2018-10-25 23:37:40 You need an oil painting on velvet self portrait behind you. Big gaudy gold frame....

157 2018-10-25 23:37:38 I use bacon if pork belly isn’t available if I’m browning my ground meat before slow cooking it into a curry.  I also use it as a replacement for sesame oil (I love that stuff) on furikake omurice.
158 2018-10-25 23:37:36 It could be done. 1/2 or 1/4 the Brussels, sear them 1st in an oil maple syrup marinade

True haha
160 2018-10-25 23:37:33 Knowing how to stitch up a simple button, or the awful tattered zipper saved me quite a bit.
Then having a dad that had (though assisted) me change my own oil and do tire rotation also saves a small fortune.
161 2018-10-25 23:37:27 I love olive oil so much thank you Mediterranean civilizations

164 2018-10-25 23:36:53 I'm sure the formula has altered, maybe it's the Palm oil, or has that always been used?
165 2018-10-25 23:36:44 May you be announced with CBD oil and ashes from the Fruit of the Loom
166 2018-10-25 23:36:44 No, not quite. We are unique even without the oil. 
167 2018-10-25 23:36:26 I read that as *Castrol oil* and had to stop and think ‘what the fuck is CK doing rubbing motor oil on his skin’ 
168 2018-10-25 23:36:17 na miss ko yung amoy ng oil paint kaso wala akong canvas!!! :(((
169 2018-10-25 23:36:16 This olive oil is perfect.
170 2018-10-25 23:36:16 And Rick Perry’s wanted to dismantle the DOE when he ran for president. Perry is a TX oil man and is clueless about anything nuclear.
171 2018-10-25 23:36:03 Axel, oil pan gasket, n oil change tomorrow
172 2018-10-25 23:35:45 Fox news is on at the oil change place and after five minutes I'm now convinced there's gonna be war crimes done at the border and no one is gonna bat an eye
173 2018-10-25 23:35:39 We keep being told that Saudi Arabia is an essential ally against terrorism. The country that's committing terrorism (bombing civilians) and genocide (blockade-induced starvation) in Yemen, bankrolls jihadists and wants us to fight Iran. Why is it our ally? Oh, right, oil.

176 2018-10-25 23:34:51 Oil prices, increasing FED rates, crony business environment, limited investments on local manufacturing industries for long years, spiking local currency debt yields etc. can put any country in that room.
177 2018-10-25 23:34:32 Trump and the Saudi did those fake bombs as a distraction so the media would get off of them so Trump can get his cut from the oil deal
178 2018-10-25 23:34:20 Tire shine
179 2018-10-25 23:34:18 oh try the ors olive oil alone or the one that has both olive oil and pequi oil I like the pequi oil better. It lasts longer.
180 2018-10-25 23:33:58 Just so we're clear, an Albemarle County School Board member just questioned, during a meeting, the possibility that oil comes from fossils. Smh.
181 2018-10-25 23:33:35 When we supplement companies like att and oil comapanies, we found our leak.

183 2018-10-25 23:32:56 i can tell it’s winter time because my coconut oil is totally solid
184 2018-10-25 23:32:50 Nope...u have oil interests in power but least that is fading very..very slowly...if only there was a single body with $billions of funding to bribe those elected to think another way...terrible non democratic view!
185 2018-10-25 23:32:46 I am getting over an eye infection of my oil gland, honestly who gets an infection in their oil gland  #Me. I also have bronchitis, other than that, im healing, taking meds, doing grreeaat.  More importantly how have you been?
#SaveShadowhunters
186 2018-10-25 23:32:33 When I started cleansing for 60 secs my pores shrank. The oil helped my hyperpigmentation. The AHA & spot treatment helped my acne. But the AHA helps hyperpigmentation too
187 2018-10-25 23:32:28 Someone dump oil on the racing surface?
188 2018-10-25 23:32:03 Watched it live when she was telling the Oil company executives the government would take them over and run them. Mexico has PEMEX which which is run by their government. We don’t want that here.
189 2018-10-25 23:32:03 Oil furnace? Like, kerosene?
190 2018-10-25 23:31:52 Hunger Oil

192 2018-10-25 23:31:35 I like wilted kale. But that's probably the olive oil and garlic doing the trick
193 2018-10-25 23:31:34 Then why does Big Oil get BILLIONS in subsidies?
194 2018-10-25 23:31:34 Almost like Katrina hit the off shore oil rigs and the others hit other areas with less oil stuff.
195 2018-10-25 23:31:21 Less oil we buy from middle east especially  S.A.
196 2018-10-25 23:31:11 Mr Killa really did THAT with oil it down lawd
197 2018-10-25 23:31:08 When the oil runs out I'm sure that will be your best option

206 2018-10-25 23:30:14 Same. And some type of moisturizer or baby oil if I want less frizz 
207 2018-10-25 23:30:12 Fish oil!!!
208 2018-10-25 23:30:08 Another way we could transport this oil and gas is through the air. Planes would fly and transport this oil to its destination. We could also transport this oil through pipelines, although there is the fear of a pipe bursting, causing an oil spill. #UCBAMKTG2080

212 2018-10-25 23:29:46 I'm sorry if you didn't grow up riding on the truck tailgate dragging your shoe in the gravel...or drink coke from a bottle...or learn how to play Pitch with your family...or how to hunt and fish with your grandpa...or how to change your own oil with your dad.
213 2018-10-25 23:29:43 Also we have a no trousers rule and underwear must show plenty of thigh. And you have to oil up and wrestle with me once a week minimum
214 2018-10-25 23:29:42 おいる三郎さんありがとう嬉しいっす
215 2018-10-25 23:29:41 I use turmeric soap (cleanse for at least 60secs), AHA solution, moisturize with rose hip seed oil, then use sunscreen. At nights I use persagel before the oil, it's a spot treatment but I put it on my whole face.
216 2018-10-25 23:29:32 You could keep buying oil from them . That’s clear consequences .
217 2018-10-25 23:28:59 Bukan takat midnight oil, ni dah burning sampai ke fajar oil kerja xsiap2 lagi

219 2018-10-25 23:28:53 i just texted my neighbor asking for vegetable oil and she came over in the freezing rain to give me a WHOLE BOTTLE. I LOVE HER. YALL
220 2018-10-25 23:28:50 5/
Maybe the differential is largely due to transportation constraints & easier access to global markets would be good for our oil prices. Or maybe it won't matter in the long run as the glut of oil
221 2018-10-25 23:28:43 Found a scented oil Glade Plugin at Home Depot. Seems I may have conquered the Smoking Room.
222 2018-10-25 23:28:18 Scheer- If it doesn’t happen in Alberta it doesn’t matter. Ps I oil workers but there is more to Canada than Alberta. Tell your Rebel Media handlers it’s time for them to go away.
223 2018-10-25 23:28:10 Drop in the bucket. Trudeau just bought an 8bn oil pipeline. Corporations hide 15bn in tax havens overseas. Invest in Crown corps, don't give them to corporate oligarchs.
224 2018-10-25 23:28:10 Appeal to futility fallacy. We burn fossil fuels because the energy industry is based in oil. While I may have to use these technologies, I can invest & advocate for a better system - a renewable one. I'm FAR from perfect, doesn't mean I have to stop trying to be better, though.
225 2018-10-25 23:28:10 No, it won’t. No one wants bituminous oil.

I think that’s the direction he was going with that tweet. Nigerian is really red because of many of tomatoes and palm oil they add.

235 2018-10-25 23:27:07 The left likes using scare tactics when it comes to energy usage. Here are the facts:
- We have an abundance of oil and natural gas left
- The market is naturally shifting to clean energy
- American companies are producing some of the most energy efficient products in history

240 2018-10-25 23:26:35 i aint use no recipe i took a jerk merinade from the store and doctored it up w brown sugar soy sauce vinegar onion powder cooking oil and let it sit 3 days
241 2018-10-25 23:26:14 He doing something our previous Prime Minister and neighbour to the south, and our Friends in England won’t. Say he is willing to lose money to be in the right side of history. The next step would be to stop using their oil and by our own.
242 2018-10-25 23:26:11 I need to get some vitamin e oil
243 2018-10-25 23:26:00 I was visiting a ranch in Texas to take my daughter to a bat cave. Rick Perry was there with Mark Walburg . I was like what the hell are they doing here. I was told the ranch belong to and oil man. So probably shit like that

245 2018-10-25 23:25:59 I finally received my black seed oil. 

Guys if you ever have a deep feel you can’t get over. Don’t brush it off. Listen to your body. I feel so lethargic, head hurting, eyes pounding 
246 2018-10-25 23:25:50 You are on the wrong side of history. Shell Oil Co predicts the end of oil in 20 yrs
247 2018-10-25 23:25:49 I appreciate the response, but it makes no sense, your leader is asking for more oil cars, you and I both know there is no more rail line going down, so more oil cars means less grain, I think you need to talk to @RachelNotley not CP and CN!

250 2018-10-25 23:25:29 Yeah apply it on scalp and massage well. Leave it on for 2 hrs or more. Probably mix it with a lighter oil like coconut oil while applying. Castor oil is too thick for direct application.

252 2018-10-25 23:25:24 Strange night. Out with guys I used to work with b4 I retired. Kept getting told how I “got out at the right time”, “how I’m missed” and “how handsome I am”
Going by those comments you’d think I worked in a gay bar and not on an oil rig.

263 2018-10-25 23:23:49 .....what are the facts around palm oil. It has always been considered a 'bad' fat and is used in many food products....it is shown as a good fat here.
264 2018-10-25 23:23:41 — does best is walking all around Bert and mewling for attention, sniffing the oil and licking it before sneezing and looking at him like he’s betrayed her...forever.

But then she’s back to slinking around, getting fur ALL over him like the good girl she is.
265 2018-10-25 23:23:30 The concern about a rising #US #oil inventory and a lower demand prospect due to a slower global growth forecasted by the #IMF may buffet oil prices. Other political factors such as the US sanctions to Iranian oil due from 4 November could remain a weight on investor thinking.

278 2018-10-25 23:22:06 It's a one two punch of embargo & drought.  No lifelines to building solar arrays or desalinization projects until they're willing to sell off all their oil assets to the "right" buyers.
279 2018-10-25 23:22:03 In other words, cover the externality to pay for the environmental degradation and health risks from oil.

technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, have caused a production boom in the Bakken formation which lies beneath the northwestern part of North Dakota. WSC and Bakken compete for pipelines and railway space. By the end of 2010, oil
288 2018-10-25 23:20:51 So many "geopoliticians" seem to think Trump is the only one that matters. Trump can sell him arms. Trump can't help MBS stage a successful Aramco IPO. He can't help him attract the capital he needs to get Saudi Arabia's economy onto something besides oil.

291 2018-10-25 23:20:33 Doesn’t sound like Kenny is operating in “Real Time”. This is not what we need. We need someone to get our products to market, diversify Alberta so we are not “Oil Dependent” and develop strategies to ease our dept getting albertans back to work. Not a war room. Lost my vote.
292 2018-10-25 23:20:29 absolutely not. coolant is less than $10 or just use a water hose and fill it up.  but if you have low coolant, you could have a leak. need to find it.  or a cracked head.. which you can see if you check the oil and see any water, etc, on the dipstick. then you have a major issue

differential prices? What, if any, role will increasing transportation have on WCS prices? The current evidence does not support the premise distribution constraints are responsible for such a large differential.

I'm very happy to report that I have received your care package of roasted deer chunks and fresh raccoon oil. The men are hard at work preparing to engage the Militia Men of Boston. Reports say they are to arrive one day later than normal. Until next I write,

309 2018-10-25 23:18:33 lmaoooo sir. It’s actually due to the new argon oil shampoo I have and the Jamaican black castor oil to rub in after. Unfortunately now poussé has blessed this beard in weeks
310 2018-10-25 23:18:28 Long explanation. Now they're *victims*.
Half of our society runs on victimhood. It's traded like oil futures.
Yes. It's sick. Yes it is very, very real.
311 2018-10-25 23:18:24 Instead of bitching about a wrestling show, why don't you write your congressional rep about limiting imports on Saudi oil? Something that would actually make a difference...or just post a screen cap of you cancelling a streaming service. You do you.
312 2018-10-25 23:18:20 Try coconut oil
313 2018-10-25 23:18:19 I have chronic back pain. Have for years. My doctor recommended CBD oil. She said, “ Don’t worry, it won’t get you high “. I didn’t really consider that a strong selling point?
314 2018-10-25 23:18:09 Good point .. one of the reasons I love your channel. I like the natural glow bronzey look .. 

Also I ended up buying that kosas tinted face oil from your last video .. can’t wait to try it.

319 2018-10-25 23:17:36 A few things could help, idk if you’re using an oil or some kind of cream but if it’s oil, try warming it up first before applying and then seal with a cream. If it’s cream you’re using now, try using an oil first. But you may still have to try a few diff things of course.
320 2018-10-25 23:17:30 I apply coconut oil and then a dab of baking soda....all day long strong.  No issue of stinky smelly.  Recommend it for women.  Not sure how it would work with hairy armpits.

323 2018-10-25 23:16:48 Greener innovation is already in high demand for companies that rely on coal and/or oil related burning. Taxing average people and constantly moving the deadline to the right isn’t the answer, opening up the market to more competition/innovation is.
324 2018-10-25 23:16:41 I am NOT SURE HOW TO EXPLAIN that 10 years of rising oil prices and inflation, in conjunction with massively upgraded articulation, complication and parts count is going to result in shorter toys, especially when your yardstick is THE SHORTEST TOY IN THE LINE.
325 2018-10-25 23:16:27 The proven oil reserves in:
Venezuela are largest in the world, totaling 297 billion barrels. 

Saudi Arabia are the 2nd largest in the world, estimated to be 268 billion barrels

Why don’t we all boycott Saudi? 

Because they buy our Arms! 

So we don’t have a leg to stand on.

329 2018-10-25 23:15:40 If we pushed for car manufacturers to stop producing cars which rely on diesel and supported them@to convert to production of electric cars we would lessen our reliance on oil.  We don’t need to produce or sell arms either!
330 2018-10-25 23:15:00 I don’t wanna get an oil change I just got one the last time lmao df
331 2018-10-25 23:14:49 A lot of people who use #Cannabis to make Oil for Cannabutter have more than 30grams. Should be more like 200Grams not just 30. So ridiculous for a plant thats never killed and Can't Kill us because of our Endocannabinoid System which regulates the ones we make already. #cndpoli

335 2018-10-25 23:14:18 Instead of invading Iraq we should have invaded Mexico & went all the way to the canal.Mexicans would have been US citizens,not a life lost,all the oil in the world,cur off access ofisis and drugs to US,and no need for a wall,just musing
336 2018-10-25 23:14:07 US domestic oil and natural gas marketers and basis traders will look at that image and think, "Those flat earth people must be correct!!" #OOTT

339 2018-10-25 23:13:37 It was like “Which country on the Red Sea stopped oil production for certain countries due to the 9/11 attacks”. Rachel Strobel said Saudi Arabia and I said Egypt. BAM 4th grade champ haha
340 2018-10-25 23:13:25 Made it to Saginaw safe and sound. Have more work on the car to do since shes leaking oil pretty bad but it should hopefully be good by the time we leave
341 2018-10-25 23:13:21 I realized I didn’t need the spot cause I was getting my oil changed but she never did get out of her car
342 2018-10-25 23:13:20 No offense, but since humans have tried to “control” various aspects of the world/nature, we’ve only made it worse. Climate change, deforestation, large # of extinction/endangered species due to overfishing/hunting & oil spills, horrible air, etc. “control” isn’t always best.
343 2018-10-25 23:13:17 What a poor “treatment” it has been. Snake oil and fascism.  It has sickened our democracy.  A true RINO.
344 2018-10-25 23:12:58 It appears you're missing the key point: China has shrewdly maneuvered things such that it is now in a position to print RMB for its strategic commodity needs. Already doing it with Russia, Iran, Angola, Venezuela. When Saudi begins selling its oil for RMB, USD hegemony ends.
345 2018-10-25 23:12:41 And all those regs AGAINST SAFETY FOR WATER, AIR, OIL RIGS, COAL MINES will cost about 80,000 lives over the next 10 years

352 2018-10-25 23:11:05 Trump NEVER owns up to how his own rhetoric has been throwing oil on the fires.  You Dinesh NEVER call him to account, but then, like Trump, you never own up to mistakes or practice sound correction method
353 2018-10-25 23:10:58 Burning a bit of midnight oil but well worth the listen, @Tyson_Fury speaking about Suicide, Mental illness, Goal Setting, Boxing Matchups & Training on Joe Rogan's podcast. Spreading the message on mental health awareness. Great work and will see you smash it in December 
354 2018-10-25 23:10:49 Venezuela is ruined by its oil reserves which the US wants & imposed sanctions coupled with in country CIA operations to destabilise the country.

368 2018-10-25 23:09:38 Agreed. Others controlling oil is part of the unrest and terrorism in the world. We have the opportunity to become the world's largest exporter of oil. We should take it and free ourselves from dependance on oil from the ME. We are sitting on liquid gold.

370 2018-10-25 23:09:36 My point exactly. My personal experience along with everyone else’s personal experience brought us all to the ballot box in 2016 b/c Hillary Clinton didn’t have our values in mind. Obama regulated American oil production to strengthen dependence on foreign oil.
371 2018-10-25 23:09:35 I tried to make a bath bomb, but I put wayyy too much oil in it and it felt like I was bathing in butter

384 2018-10-25 23:07:43 Use oil from the east coast oil fields. It is the right type for existing refineries, you can practically see the fields from the refineries. That also doesn't drive up the price of natural gas in the east.

426 2018-10-25 23:03:20 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

428 2018-10-25 23:03:11 That’s awesome.  I live and work in North Dakota.  That’s more drilling oil for us.  Thank you Gov Kate Brown
429 2018-10-25 23:03:04 ありがとうございます
430 2018-10-25 23:02:51 I don’t know about the Turks but his sucking up to the Saudi’s has everything to do with money, wealth, fame and future fortunes for the Trump Dynasty. He’ll believe the Saudi’s before the Turks. Oil and cash talk and bullshit walks.

432 2018-10-25 23:02:44 Finally trying CBD oil. So far, so good 
433 2018-10-25 23:02:37 遠くから大英さんに悪いので、まず出演側の赤いひとに相談してみますね。
434 2018-10-25 23:02:32 ew i don’t like blending oil paint 
435 2018-10-25 23:02:24 FYI The bill does not give property owners the ability to wave these restrictions if they want development on their land. This effectively strips the property owner's mineral rights and also could decimate small rural economies where oil and gas are the primary economic activity.
436 2018-10-25 23:02:11 Some sort of crates. Probably related to oil bunkering (theft of oil from pipelines).

440 2018-10-25 23:02:02 #ES_F Crude oil is trapped within a 2 points trading range 65.75 67.75 burning and churning like mad. This back and forth will continue until either side breaks. till then the best bet is to sell from the high of the range 67.40 -67.75 and buy from 65.96 65.75. Until be break out
441 2018-10-25 23:01:57 update: i was supposed to get an oil change at 1500 miles, we’re. at 7064 miles

445 2018-10-25 23:01:30 Has anyone tried CBD oil for anxiety?   I need something 
446 2018-10-25 23:01:05 vitamin e oil !!!!
447 2018-10-25 23:00:48 Also concerning is the setback from any building used for work. My understanding of the law is that there is no exception to buildings used in the development of oil and gas, which understandably would be close to any of the above restricted activities.
448 2018-10-25 23:00:46 When did Coventry strike oil? Maybe they should fix the roads. It's always nice listening to teenagers playing violent video games at the Booth and Dimock Library!

453 2018-10-25 23:00:16 If any of it made it into the water table, Texas would have been an uninhabitable wasteland long ago. Yet it supports more people than CO with its widespread oil and gas development
454 2018-10-25 23:00:12 So sorry to hear your mom's in pain.
Have you researched CBD oil? It's good for a wide range of ailments, including inflammation. 
Praying your mom gets better!
455 2018-10-25 22:59:57 I got a craving for something super sweet and went to the kitchen to improvise a canoli with a flour tortilla, powdered sugar and Mexican ricotta (requeson). But there was no cooking oil. Too lazy to go to the store so I used butter. Stupid me, forgot to check if it was unsalted.
456 2018-10-25 22:59:44 Incredible that 2 of the 3 largest emitters are allowed to continue to increase CO2 production, grow their economies, and Canada has agreed to commit economic suicide.  I guess it makes sense, after all we also sell our oil at an 75% discount to the biggest economy in the world.

Who uses c b d oil for anxiety?

 #anxiety #PTSD #depression #bipolar #KeepTalkingMH #mentalillness #BPD #EndtheStigma #SickNotWeak #mentalhealth #EndTheStigma #LPfamily
460 2018-10-25 22:59:11 Been rubbing castor oil into my shoulder. Really helps muscle & tendon issues. Used it when I was racing the bicycle & training. Ultimate natural cure for tendonitis
461 2018-10-25 22:59:08 That and without us buying Shit ton of oil they go bankrupt.
462 2018-10-25 22:58:58 Olive oil will fix your back right up.  There is an organic extra virgin olive oil that Walmart sells that is really good. Great Value brand. It is all I use. Not expensive, and It Is Yummy

464 2018-10-25 22:58:52 The way day are going down day would soon discover crude oil 
465 2018-10-25 22:58:44 FYI, some flow lines used in oil and gas are necessary to capture methane, a requirement that only Colorado has. (And a huge environmental win as methane is a huge contributor to climate change.)
466 2018-10-25 22:58:36 Makes you wish everyone would get off their lame to blame asses and vote to make CANNABIS 100% RECREATIONAL so BIG PHARMA AND BIG OIL can't get their grubby hands all up in it. The fun fact of the day is its too late. The damage is done We can only try to give future gens freedom
467 2018-10-25 22:58:35 Considering who the finalists are #RedSox have a real shot of sweeping the AL Gold Glove Awards
468 2018-10-25 22:58:33 It's cold. My heart is a bit freezing. I want to go home, but I can't. Maybe, because there's no oil to make me fly. Hahaha
469 2018-10-25 22:58:20 Slick mist for sure.
470 2018-10-25 22:58:13 Just a few percentage  points will swing it, and Brexit looks like the very vehicle to realise that.Good luck to England when the car plants leave,your currency bombs and Scotland develops it's East Coast ports to trade our oil , fish etc with our partners  in the EU.
471 2018-10-25 22:58:01 Warren Buffer also has Rockefeller-esque control of the railroads and manufacturing of oil tanker cars. No wonder why he loved Obama.

473 2018-10-25 22:57:57 Only 40 years ago EVERY meteorologist was predicting that by now we'd all be living in igloos. 

Now all the ice caps are going to disappear?

Do you really think man is powerful enough to effect the earth in such a major way?

Where is all the oil that was leaked into the Gulf?
474 2018-10-25 22:57:38 Do not void or suspend...cut back on oil imports
475 2018-10-25 22:57:38 Guilty too, although I periodically do check my tyres and lately after an oil warning light came on I’ve been checking the oil.
476 2018-10-25 22:57:36 寝てた( ﾟдﾟ)ﾊｯ!
477 2018-10-25 22:57:30 This has bothered me for some time - curiously no energy company or official has ever articulated the least amount of frustration or anger over the treatment their industry has suffered since 2014 - also we ship approx 1M bpd of oil to the US (@ a 40-50% discount) 
478 2018-10-25 22:57:18 Never tried their deodorant but I love their coconut oil and have their body shimmer and lip balm. Just bough schmidtts jasmine tea natural deodorant to try cuz I really like their shower gel
479 2018-10-25 22:57:15 @Lucas_Oil fuel injector cleaner!
480 2018-10-25 22:57:02 Oil rich nation, I agree with him, but resources wise and the human capital. I think we’re rich. You know human capital can be a blessing or a disaster for a country, right now in Nigeria is a disaster.
481 2018-10-25 22:57:02 This man wants fried chicken but I'm traumatized cause last time oil burned me in 5 spots. 
482 2018-10-25 22:56:53 Gold or oil. Or you can trade forex & short the dollar (I’d give it a month or so though). Other than that - about everything is a gamble lol
483 2018-10-25 22:56:52 All presidents are the same president! Greyhound buses don’t run on gasoline, they run on melted greyhound dogs! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
484 2018-10-25 22:56:40 In addition to new wells, " the exploration for, & the drilling, production, & processing of oil or natural gas. Oil & natural gas development also includes hydraulic fracturing, flowlines between oil & natural gas facilities, & the treatment of associated waste." (Blue book)
485 2018-10-25 22:56:34 YG and Promotion is like water and oil.. do they know every YG fandom always harassing and begging YG, because lack of promotion. And about Gangnam style, I know it because many of my non kpop fan show it to me. I don't even know PSY in same agency of BIGBANG.
486 2018-10-25 22:56:32 I didn’t know that I needed cilantro essential oil in my life until now, it’s all I can think about.
487 2018-10-25 22:56:19 @DBrownChevrolet Can’t even list all of the ways you have provided my family awful service over the past eight months.  But not putting on the oil cap, not using synthetic oil AND charging my niece $60 when it should have been free is the last thing we will tolerate.
488 2018-10-25 22:56:17 Capital Oil people them... I'm not surprised
489 2018-10-25 22:56:07 Octane booster

491 2018-10-25 22:55:46 Coconut oil
492 2018-10-25 22:55:39 Actually it's the ONLY deadly force that we should be ok with.  When it actually affects our own borders, on our own soil, and not just bombing foreign countries over oil, money, power, control, and greed.
493 2018-10-25 22:55:36 Unless Knight is getting at the fact that in the mixture, the oil is accelerating upward and the water accelerating downward. Then the CoM for the liquid is slowly lowering, which means a slightly greater pressure on the bottom of the container. But that's pretty technical.
494 2018-10-25 22:55:31 Plus that looks like a 2-stroke, so would be leaching oil into the water. Lol
495 2018-10-25 22:55:20 @Lucas_Oil octane boosters and fuel treatments of course

498 2018-10-25 22:54:34 Get extra Virgin olive oil and make sure it's from Greece

501 2018-10-25 22:54:25 Anti’s room is definitely the source of the alluring smell. He has potpourri, essential oil, the works...but no candles or incense. Nothing that needs fire. While his main room is definitely comfy, his room is...next level. He has at least seven pillows and three blankets on —
502 2018-10-25 22:54:21 The octane booster. Get more gas mileage using this!
503 2018-10-25 22:54:10 With all their oil money, you'd think the Saudis could've hired someone more competent than Maxwell Smart to handle their Khashoggi excuses. "Would you believe [ridiculous bullshit]? No? Well, would you believe [other ridiculous bullshit? Would you believe...."
504 2018-10-25 22:54:03 John u have not been a unifier or even a committed politician. Ur a snake oil salesman who can run in 2020 as a democrat. Go for it
505 2018-10-25 22:53:57 Olive oil is like IPAs. Gotta consume fresh!!!!
506 2018-10-25 22:53:54 CNY oil contract is live, 1st phys delivery was Sep, 44 million bbls of open interest for next phys deliv mth in Dec, & Foreign Policy Journal just said Saudi is close to selling oil to China in CNY.  Stay tuned - Chinese USD needs for commodities may be about to fall.
507 2018-10-25 22:53:40 Beautiful and very fragile.  In their natural state, they will hold up under dry, desert conditions. Humidity makes them fall apart and get mushy. My Dad used to bring them home from oil leases near the Pecos River when I was a kid - such a treat!
508 2018-10-25 22:53:35 Wait. I keep saying "object" but there's not an object in the question. If it's just the bottom of the container, the pressure should not change. But if we're talking about the pressure on a submerged object, originally below the oil but now in the mixture, then it would go up.
509 2018-10-25 22:53:22 It can't be declassified it doesn't belong to the US. If Erdogan wants to release it he will, but Erdogan will never release as he wants a deal with the Saudi's. Both trump and Erdogan will get what they want (Money/Oil/Deals) Salman will pay up and the tape will disappear
510 2018-10-25 22:53:15 middle east had no issues with USA until after WWII, auto dealers hyped up notion every American Deserved a car & cheap gas. Big Oil (with own army) severely exploited middle east oil countries, after Germany did so for war & brought much collateral war on innocents. 

.
511 2018-10-25 22:53:13 I used to hate it too. Thought it tasted like dirt. Then I learned to like it - roasted in olive oil with lemon is lovely, but I even eat it raw now. My former self is sickened.
512 2018-10-25 22:53:13 My first concern is the introduction. You and Grace miscatagorize the measure as one to only increase setbacks between new oil wells and homes, but one of the most surprising facts about the bill is it goes far beyond that.
513 2018-10-25 22:53:11 wow get a load of rockafeller over here talking about the value of oil
514 2018-10-25 22:52:59 The sad thing about the trust decision was that it was mostly elderly ppl who held these trusts in their RRSP’s. My mom for example had over 10,000 shares of two oil trusts. She lost over 100k that day. She was lucky but many retired people where hurt badly.
515 2018-10-25 22:52:24 Readying the teleporter for @TwitchCon. It needs oil, plasma, a fusion core and a couple of o-rings... 
516 2018-10-25 22:52:21 -Massive youth unemployment
-Huge % of pop. reliant on govt 
-Reduction of society-wide subsidies/handouts

KSA may have a low operational oil breakeven, but fiscal breakeven approaches $100/bbl

Political turmoil just adds urgency
517 2018-10-25 22:52:19 I need a new beard oil. Any suggestions?
518 2018-10-25 22:52:18 I live in commerce city Colorado near suncor oil refinery who constantly releases sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere and no one bats an eye about it!
519 2018-10-25 22:52:16 It definitely wasn’t my plan till the transmission oil all fell out!!
520 2018-10-25 22:51:59 Marxist just cant seem to quit it when central planning fails or stagnates

then you end up with factories with suicide nets. And people boiling shit to make gutter oil despite these 'regulations'.
521 2018-10-25 22:51:44 Unlike coal, oil and gas? 
522 2018-10-25 22:51:43 Your country & your murderer Crown Prince are the problem. If your leaders had control of Yemen they would have clear access to the Gulf of Aden. All for money & oil! Now you want to kill innocent women & children with American military weapons & help create a humanitarian crisis
523 2018-10-25 22:51:35 My initial thought process was exactly as Dan describes. But the weight above the object would be lower, as some of the oil is now lower in the fluid, meaning an equal volume of water is now higher. So the weight of fluid above the object is actually more.

I learned something!
524 2018-10-25 22:51:30 he should cut his hair short again and wear a nice button-up shirt all the time instead of a blouse and oil hair

526 2018-10-25 22:51:11 my gym is selling cbd oil at the check-in desk 
527 2018-10-25 22:51:10 Like using the detailer. Works like a champ
528 2018-10-25 22:51:07 Bought a basketball just to oil your booty up and twerk on it.... and whole time was like “yeah this a lit idea” 
529 2018-10-25 22:50:53 Shredded pork skin at a Vietnamese restaurant. Ordered it by accident, but decided to give it a try. No bueno. I imagine it's an acquired taste. 

I eat uncooked artichokes; dipping the white of the leaves in salted olive oil. I grew up eating it. Others tend not to like it.
530 2018-10-25 22:50:28 Oil is very valuable so in my mind they're already winners
531 2018-10-25 22:50:19 Destruction of civilizations just for oil. Sad times we living in....
532 2018-10-25 22:50:15

534 2018-10-25 22:50:03 Dove bar soap. And Coconut oil on my skin.
535 2018-10-25 22:50:01 Its perfectly fine and normal. I had to buy a new feeder and was worried that the chickadees didn't like it. I have waited for them to find it - off to the Coop to buy another 10 kg bag of black oil seeds. #MyBirdFeeder
536 2018-10-25 22:49:47 On my way to the grocery to literally only buy olive oil and a cucumber....odds the cashier gives me a funny look?
537 2018-10-25 22:49:36 The supposed "deep sleep" phenomena didn't occur at all when I took CBD oil, now I know why.

543 2018-10-25 22:48:56 In case of oil, it started being used before being traded in the markets. For XRP, the markets and trading came before actual daily use cases. Therefore, some see XRP as a security. But, it is just a matter of order and should not affect a nature of oil and XRP as utility. (2/2)
544 2018-10-25 22:48:53 like, they really push keeping the boat clean, but you just walk through TG Lube Oil Bay in Engine Room Lower level and you get like a film of oil, the air is oily.
545 2018-10-25 22:48:47 And that would be you. There company was profitable.

All the auto companies got subsidies. All the gas auto companies benefit from obscenely large subsidies to gas/oil firms. Your complaint that Tesla gets subsidies when the others benefit far more is deliberately misleading.
546 2018-10-25 22:48:45 If I break ur heart, Na oil spillage. I study this ur love for freedom college. This ur love sweet like Yam porridge....Underrated hook line by Duncan Mighty
547 2018-10-25 22:48:44 We are environmentalists. We all live here. #natgas has contributed greatly to our shift away from coal for electricity. As a result America leads the world in reducing CO2. We support properly regulated oil and gas production.
548 2018-10-25 22:48:43 I had to draw a FBD to figure this out. The net force on the object is due to Fg and Fb. Fb is dependent on the density of the liquid. When the oil and water mix, the density is lower, so Fb is smaller, making the magnitude net force greater.

551 2018-10-25 22:48:27 good progress made with "real" CBD oil, check out also #gcMAF if its legal where you are, (also "wild lettuce" all the pain relief of morphine without addiction and grows in most backyards)
552 2018-10-25 22:48:18 Gas additive or oil fortifier !
553 2018-10-25 22:48:14 Oil is Canada s largest export. Trans Mountain  Energy East going nowhere. Liberals wont win a single seat in Alberta and Saskatchewan
554 2018-10-25 22:48:09 You know, the OIL helps!

559 2018-10-25 22:46:55 Like there's a tribe being arrested, beaten, pepper sprayed and killed over in Louisiana right now cause a company is building an oil pipeline over their homes.
560 2018-10-25 22:46:52 I want an oil well for Christmas. Just one.
561 2018-10-25 22:46:42 No oil wells either. Hmm...

563 2018-10-25 22:46:34 We use 100 million barrels of oil every day. (...) There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground, so we can't save the world by playing by the rules because the rules have to change. Everything needs to change and it has to start today –Greta Thunberg
564 2018-10-25 22:46:26 These are valid concerns, expressed by decent, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
565 2018-10-25 22:46:23 We all saw Christian hulls work college tip the tuna oil into the bin so I don't get why I can be different in a work force

573 2018-10-25 22:45:37 Thoughts on CBD Oil?! #CBDOil #CBD
574 2018-10-25 22:45:36 If you compare the price of soy oil or sugar with the price of butter, dripping, or coconut oil, you can see that there is already the equivalent of a massive tax on saturated fat in terms of price difference.
Plus, UK already modelled a fat tax and predicted it would cost lives.

576 2018-10-25 22:45:29 They refuse to wrap it, use oil, usually flat iron daily, and probably go to white stylists. They'd sooner die than let their Becky troop see them in a bonnet
577 2018-10-25 22:45:09 Today I took a shower in my durag bc this coconut oil ain’t leaving my scalp for AT LEAST the rest of eternity.

583 2018-10-25 22:44:34 Now, what would the Russians, who depend on oil sales, want you to believe? 

The con-artist depends on the mark refusing to believe they’re being conned.
584 2018-10-25 22:44:32 そうですね。いい意味で予想外の作風でした
585 2018-10-25 22:44:32 Vastly larger economy, lessened our dependence on their largest asset (oil), a say in the German Nordstream deal, vastly superior ground forces in Syria, selling defensive arms to Ukraine, assisting Poland with anti-russian missile defense systems, etc etc etc etc.
586 2018-10-25 22:44:28 We need a commission to investigate where she found cooking oil to waste in this pferitical moment
587 2018-10-25 22:44:28 You need rick simpson oil, alot of it and cbd also. Sorry to hear this.
588 2018-10-25 22:44:23 Yeah but that rich copper fella sure has some expensive oil changes

593 2018-10-25 22:43:57 My second time taking CBD oil (a gift from my cousin) and I think it....really messes me up. The next day I feel groggy and unfocused. Anyone else use it?
594 2018-10-25 22:43:53 #Trump,#Congress, want to give America a Tax cut, push big oil to reduce gas prices at the pump. Force them to do what they have to do, increase refineries and the decrease the cost of refining.
595 2018-10-25 22:43:50 Koch likes oil?
596 2018-10-25 22:43:49 Today was a take down on Au yesterday was oil.  Painful to see value in commodities that the State tries to price control. Au down 5 bucks XAU down 5% what a joke our captured markets have become.
597 2018-10-25 22:43:47 I agree there are problems with Crony Capitalism.

Most politicians, on both sides, have been bought by Big Oil. But Big Oil Tycoons, like the Koch Brothers, give money to a lot of a Libertarian and Classical Liberal think-tanks. So a lot of their propaganda is flouting around.

601 2018-10-25 22:43:05 On a little road trip and 1 hr 10 min into it my friend just brought out her newest ~oil~ for us to smell. It’s supposed to help you think “clearer”.  Right.
602 2018-10-25 22:42:39 I wonder what he said to Suncor, Cenovus, CNRL, Imperial Oil - who all support carbon pricing.

604 2018-10-25 22:42:19 Thank goodness Driver & if passenger(s) are okay. I wouldn't want to be the #garage that did the Oil Change. Either there's a crack in the oil pan, the head cover gasket, the spark plugs/sensors OR person at garage forgot to put the cap back on or correctly tightened. #notgood

609 2018-10-25 22:41:09 My 2005 just turned 230,000 miles and still drives great and looks great. Regular oil changes etc have paid off.
610 2018-10-25 22:41:07 #SaudiArabia
#POTUS must inform the King and Crown Prince that any further outrageous behavior on their part will ...oh never mind. "They have the Oil." (Arby's reference).  If we sanction them, it boomerangs back on us with sky high oil (read gasoline) prices.
611 2018-10-25 22:41:04 Carrot oil also available, delivery available to every part of Nigeria.
612 2018-10-25 22:41:00 I appreciate baby oil gel...when my knuckles/hands are dry dry I need it
613 2018-10-25 22:40:58 given the facts we have today, Big oil and Big auto are beyond Evil. there are many like this. it unfortunate but all you can do is kill their business and let them retrain themselves to install solar panels.

What happens to the oil price?

So it is better to keep them enemies and sell your weapons. At the same time you can rule the oil price.

625 2018-10-25 22:38:16 Just the same as I would if this were a white man bitching about how Moors invaded France & took European slaves, so we're all owed oil money as reparations.

629 2018-10-25 22:37:57 Try coating it with linseed oil or even plain old WD-40. That usually does the trick for me.

632 2018-10-25 22:37:49 Are we getting our very own oil patch?!

634 2018-10-25 22:37:48 < erupts from him when Set mentions the oil.

"Oh that /was/ funny. She had to open the spa to get it for me." He slowly ran a finger along Set's jaw. "He didn't get to see that time. He was a bit...tied up," he stated with >
635 2018-10-25 22:37:38 I waited 3 hrs for an oil change.. ok
636 2018-10-25 22:37:32 I really wanted to get this oil change but the way this pain set up. Think this nap looking better.
637 2018-10-25 22:37:29 I finally got my dad to try my CBD oil and honestly I have never been so happy! 
638 2018-10-25 22:36:58 起きたら結構RTいいねもらってて驚いておりましてよ
639 2018-10-25 22:36:49 Lesson learned? they talk so ashamed of that yet would do it agian..for what?  Oil, Gold, diamonds? Or just  because they can¬!
640 2018-10-25 22:36:45 かならず両腕確認されるよね！
641 2018-10-25 22:36:45 You can tell a lot about how gullible someone is when they get their oil changed
642 2018-10-25 22:36:07 some things should not be forgiven. i dont care so much about some shorts who do a few hundred shares or so. its Chanos, Einhorn and Speigel and those like them for whom all I wish is a life of pain. They are nothing but bullhorns for Big Oil and Big Auto. These people are evil.
643 2018-10-25 22:35:38 @realDonaldTrump and that's Iran. Iran's regime is falling and want to save it at any cost, but it will never succeed, and Iran's oil will be completely cut off by November 4, President Trump will be in big trouble if he is exempted, and this is the US election. .
644 2018-10-25 22:35:35 What we need martial for??!
645 2018-10-25 22:35:32 I can tell you're straight because you assume oil and b.o. is a turn off smell and not a turn on smell.
646 2018-10-25 22:35:31 His policies are such an obsequious capitulation to oil money that will destroy the Texan climate that even little boys can run against him and win
647 2018-10-25 22:35:28 So let’s buy oil from countries that butcher journalists or have no environmental standards.I am sure the dictators and human rights violators in Saudi, Russia, Venezuela etc appreciate your support.Hard to believe there are such miss informed people in Canada  such as yourself
648 2018-10-25 22:35:25 I've gotten SEVEN mailers about this less than two weeks. All paid for by oil companies. I voted for the last carbon tax that failed and I already voted for this one. Fuck those greedy bastards.
649 2018-10-25 22:35:18 I am metallurgical and materials engineering (Corossion Engineering Option) graduate. I need a better job that will cater for all my needs and wants especially in oil and gas industry

653 2018-10-25 22:34:42 Does anything actually break on those or do you just do oil changes and brake pads?
654 2018-10-25 22:34:40 I disagree its tge 1980's. I thinj its the current oil control war and isreal, russia, and u.s. conspired to blame saudi arabia to control oil. Isreal is the murderer.
655 2018-10-25 22:34:35 It is obvious that leaders of business industries and governments throughout the world should refuse usage of oil and gas and generate energy from Earth’s rotating motion and/or sunlight as primary source of energy generation for reducing risks of global climate change.
656 2018-10-25 22:34:34 But a ‘fat tax’ would be a way to tax animal products, drive up the price, force consumers out of the market, drive down demand, push livestock farmers off the land and save the planet and our health with mung beans, lentils and soybean oil. What could possibly go wrong? 
657 2018-10-25 22:34:08 ...no era que el reiki y esas cositas eran como...snake oil?

V. Smil
However, natural gas producers are not sitting on their hands, they are going after oil also!

664 2018-10-25 22:33:31 hey oil kings are awesome
665 2018-10-25 22:33:31 Supposing for a moment I accept your premise that oil companies will protect their profits by passing it on. You per your readers an equally stated economic premise about the cost of doing nothing, ie. health care, air quality, water quality and..(1)
666 2018-10-25 22:33:29 Seriously. I don't want you to get hurt when you use the oil. Plus that means I can get you in bed quicker. *give you my cheeky grin*
667 2018-10-25 22:33:27 To do more than that, is to borrow more &wailers won't stop complaining as if they don't know it's better to owe more &hav infrastructures than to owe d ones they borrowed without any infrastructure to show for it even all the money we've made from oil since 1960 has been wasted!
668 2018-10-25 22:33:24 Everyone stop drilling for oil, there’s an unlimited source right on my forehead
669 2018-10-25 22:33:23 Enjoy buddy! Go oil!
670 2018-10-25 22:33:18 Today I proved that 2 microliters of diesel fuel and vegetable oil is not soluble in water.. what even is my job
671 2018-10-25 22:33:17 luckily you can't smell them through the screen. Submariners smell like oil and b.o.

A "submarine shower" is turning the water on for 2-3 seconds to get wet, soaping up, then turning it on for 4-5 seconds to rinse off. More than that and either the 15 guys in line or M-Div bro..
672 2018-10-25 22:33:06 If you can source a top clamp oil drum and use a drill.....?

682 2018-10-25 22:31:47 Sounds about right
683 2018-10-25 22:31:39 Problem is that cheap Saudi oil helped drive the post war boom prior to the Yom Kippur war. No one comes out clean.

703 2018-10-25 22:28:51 A 44 billion turnaround is not saving?   Would you say the NDP are saving right now? The NDP are struggling with oil market. Correct, when they could be selling oil at $75/bbl, we can only get $25 to $30.  You seem to blame everyone but the NDP.

716 2018-10-25 22:26:22 Palm Oil is cancelled!!
717 2018-10-25 22:26:09 True. Until their car breaks down at a stop sign..... then they’ll check the oil 
718 2018-10-25 22:26:08 Funny how fake People's Hero #TommyRobinson  never mentions; zero hour contracts, low pay, food banks, white VIP  paedos, Fracking, corrupt global corporations, banks, greedy oil  companies, illegal war etc... Wonder what his revolution would look  like?@talkRADIO @georgegalloway
719 2018-10-25 22:26:01 Tired lort , I need some MCT oil

721 2018-10-25 22:25:33 Enlightened. I took a college course in Fossil Fuels and it was one of my favorite classes. It gave insight to the retrieval, usage, storage, and future of coal, oil, and natural gas. I have several friends who have served as geologists in mines and oil wells.

725 2018-10-25 22:24:26 Cannabis oil could help you!
726 2018-10-25 22:23:57 Private companies buy it, tho they wouldn't need to source foreign oil supplies had Energy East been able to make it through the fed regulatory process. The need for E. coast refineries to use Saudi oil is a result of our national dysfunction.

731 2018-10-25 22:22:58 Both ? One is a husband & wife with son & grand child. Other is a bowls team winning a cup with their children in picture too. We may not be oil paintings but we’ve had to upgrade the team as 2 now deceased. We still manage to pull the very odd woman in the local & Benidorm ;-)
732 2018-10-25 22:22:45 That's a phony statistic using number of instances.  Pipelines leak far more oil than is lost in rail or tanker spills.
733 2018-10-25 22:22:35 This one na palm oil nobe stew 
734 2018-10-25 22:22:30 I use neat tea tree oil at the first signs, usually sees them off but yours sound like super league ones! (Get them when I'm run down/stressed)
735 2018-10-25 22:22:28 If we're feeling lazy, it's a French roast chicken recipe where you stuff the bird with lemons, baste it in olive oil+butter, lightly season it, and roast it over a bed of chopped onions, before serving the drippings over homemade croutons.
736 2018-10-25 22:22:13 Not for money. Not for oil!

746 2018-10-25 22:21:37 Yes the sections help me so much. I have super thick long natural hair and I detangle on wet hair with oil and I make sure it’s in sections so I don’t lose all my hair and mind  I clear up time during the day where I’m not sleepy or impatient so I won’t rip through my shit

750 2018-10-25 22:20:45 @SEALTeamCBS do you not have a military advisor on the set? Night vision is useless in a lighted area like the oil rig it was on Tue last episode.
751 2018-10-25 22:20:37 You are entering Homeland Security territory.  Saudis have many problems. Saudis have oil. Some people sacrifice morality in pursuit of money
752 2018-10-25 22:20:22 U.S. sanctions against Iran go into effect on November 5th, making it nearly impossible for Iran to sell oil. To keep gas prices from rising in the U.S. Saudi Arabia has agreed to fill the void with their oil. Part of the diplomacy involved in the Khashoggi situation.

758 2018-10-25 22:19:19 “Oil rig in deep space” - you were for sure thinking of Alien (even though I know they weren’t mining for oil, or unobtainium)
759 2018-10-25 22:19:14 Finally i slept at 2am last night.. after sniffing lavender oil, taking half a chlorpheniramine, listening to sleep sounds on spotify and googling how to sleeep in 1 minute. So much effort.
760 2018-10-25 22:19:10 And oil geez how did I forget oil. Finding a decent oil can be a nightmare.

765 2018-10-25 22:18:37 Fair. I definitely mix butter & coconut oil & protein powder & cinnamon & stevia into mine.
766 2018-10-25 22:18:28 I made a grilled chicken salad with olive oil and Mother’s apple cider vinegar, and topped it with curly spicy fries. Don’t judge me
767 2018-10-25 22:18:22 As a self serving, duplicitous, mendacious, scheming, power hungry, attention seeking, charlatan, and snake oil salesman I hope he's paid back in full !
768 2018-10-25 22:18:14 Vitamin E Oil is one of the thickest oils I’ve ever used. It takes forever just to pour it out of the bottle ..
769 2018-10-25 22:18:10 Hmm, yes, although there are some serious issues even with accreditation. 
Not destroying rainforest to make way for palm oil usually just means using arable land that could be used for food crops. 
Besides, Nestle are just awful for a whole pile of reasons.

774 2018-10-25 22:17:03 bro i put too much oil in my hair & now it looks like my hair still wet ::::::::::::::::))))))))))))))))))))
775 2018-10-25 22:16:46 Because they loose one of their 3 income-pillars (sale, finance, service). No more oil change that calls cars to anthe garage, hardly any parts subject to regular wear & tear, like brakes, clutch, cam belt, pumps, filters, etc. Electric cars are so much cheaper in over all costs.

784 2018-10-25 22:15:58 Whenever I take my car to get the oil changed they’ll show me how much it had and I’m like bitch I literally couldn’t care less just change and let me go
785 2018-10-25 22:15:45 She straight up said “you can’t eat any food for 21 days unless it’s a salad with oil and vinegar” all she’s doing is harming her body and the second she starts eating again, everything is going to be stored as fat.

800 2018-10-25 22:14:12 Its theo's fault for pushing turkish oil wrestling so hard
801 2018-10-25 22:14:06 D best economies don't merely run on creating jobs. What are his plans 4 security, power, education, power, reduction of the national debt, per capital income, life beyond oil and natural resources, etc. Folks would be foolish 2 vote for blanket promises based on sheer popularity
802 2018-10-25 22:14:04 construction projects were well under way when the price of oil fell. They were completed and have vacancies. That and a GIG, mobile and automated economy is changing the need for space. New realities for every sector and every industry.

804 2018-10-25 22:13:52 “Pastor” Doug is out of touch with the Holy Spirit and the Lord’s Natural Solutions. Cannabis SAVED MY LIFE. Ancient Christians used cannabis oil as a main ingredient in Holy Oil. Alcohol, meth & other man-made chemicals continue to KILL. Cannabis is God’s holy creation. 
805 2018-10-25 22:13:40 Because the media links nationalist with hitler, doesn't mean the public does. He wanted a country of one race. He was a purist & his means to that end were evil. But he needed other countries for vast resources such as oil. For this, he could not be a strict nationalist.
806 2018-10-25 22:13:37 @DarrenMacmedia Don't pull your pants down, Macca. You're just back in the saddle. And must we have to think of the G-Man and coconut oil?

808 2018-10-25 22:13:24 Years ago they used to give you a dose of castor oil to try to  induce labour! I don't think it worked very well though!! X
809 2018-10-25 22:13:23 Kai ne ma Forte oil 
810 2018-10-25 22:13:23 By 'otherside' do you mean you prefer the world use oil produced by dictatorships or do you mean you're okay to park your truck and walk to work?
811 2018-10-25 22:13:18 You should try dry pasta with red pesto. Sometimes you need to add a bit more oil as it can dry out a bit in the fridge. Better than bulk loading that, and it will take you the same amount of time 
812 2018-10-25 22:13:11 المهم اتمنى اكون من البطانه الصالحة....
813 2018-10-25 22:12:51 Some of my favorite fried chicken wings come from my local Chinese joint.

Idk what they put in that oil but they're dank as hell, man.
814 2018-10-25 22:12:49 Brilliant! I’ve got a couple of pressure lamps, a Tilly and a Vapalux. Both run on paraffin so need to be pre-heated to turn the oil to vapour so it can ignite in the mantle. Pre-heating is done using a spirit cup,  a wick soaked in meths.
815 2018-10-25 22:12:33 I’ve spent a lot of time in Indonesia, recently taking a close look at the oil palm industry. There are many parallels, the subverting of different layers of governance, misuse of grants, land theft, self-serving elites, naked claims it’s good for the economy, corruption
816 2018-10-25 22:12:23 Is extra virigin olive oil made of Volcels?
817 2018-10-25 22:12:17 And they were right at the time, over the past 40 years the ways of tracing and finding oil wells has come on leaps and bounds much like everything, 40 years ago we didn't even have a phone in every house, video recorders were a luxury, and DVDs hadn't been invented.
818 2018-10-25 22:11:56 Interesting that he's pointing to a Husky Oil upgrader built on the border town, decades ago as some kind of accomplishment.
819 2018-10-25 22:11:52 In Rec 2, i agree the panels need to hear from all those 'directly affected'. 

Because oil and gas is destroying the climate, we are all directly affected and ANY citizen should be allowed to be heard by any review panel.
820 2018-10-25 22:11:52 Isn't it exhausting to lie all the time? Check out the subsidies to the oil and gas business, they're in the trillions.

They also made a profit selling those cars, so your statements are ridiculous.
821 2018-10-25 22:11:43 Oil of you.

823 2018-10-25 22:11:37 to those people who buy older, higher mileage luxury vehicles just for clout, congrats you just signed up for $200+ oil changes for the rest of the life of your vehicle 
824 2018-10-25 22:11:27 To be fair, once one gets past the misleading headline, he only said cancelling the contract "provides us with a lever to require more answers from Saudi Arabia". Which is an accurate statement of the obvious. But what's startlingly absent is any thought of not buying Saudi oil.

831 2018-10-25 22:10:19 ...though I do think lobbing flasks of oil into the cave and sparking them off with a firebolt after they decided to just leave it and "let nature take its course" might have been a bit excessive (if entirely in character for the sorcerer whose clothes got ruined in the fight).

862 2018-10-25 22:07:11 "pipeline transport of oil is roughly 40 times safer than in rail tanks and 100 times safer than by road tankers..."
V. Smil

No wonder Greenpeace opposes pipelines.
863 2018-10-25 22:07:11 You are probably right. I don't expect them to do it. With record oil production, higher prices, and a thriving non-oil economy Alberta will soon be in the black. But the opportunity to save a lot of oil revenue that was there in earlier times is lost, as circumstances changed.

I have a B.Eng (Mechanical Engineering) as well as a certificate in Oil and Gas Production Engineering from IFP. I've been job hunting since December 2014. This might be helpful to me sir.
909 2018-10-25 21:59:32 Ben, you are about 20% correct. IF they don't find enough oil to spike the sp and get a placing away North of 15p, they will probably use the loan facility, and could end up in a difficult  position .

But if they don't hit oil, would Sanndabel agree to advance funds?

911 2018-10-25 21:59:01 Beware: using a heat pump, the smart thermostats may cost you more money. If you lower temp too must at night, in the morning, it is the oil that will kick in to raise home’s temperature back and will cost you more. heat pumps are good at maintaining temp, not raising it.

989 2018-10-25 21:47:36 @megynkelly shoulda stayed @FoxNews they were buying your snake oil. @NBCNews you knew what you signed up for. Lie down with dogs...
990 2018-10-25 21:47:27 I’d skip Thanksgiving for the next five years just to be the one to rub oil on him.

kata rang orang pake bio oil bisa walaupun lama
992 2018-10-25 21:47:23 That's why you need a competitive market place. Petrol duty still accounts for something like 80% of the cost of petrol to the consumer. The oil market is very competitive because all oil goes into a central market place - it is not sold bilaterally -

1000 2018-10-25 21:46:32 So way are we not refining our oil in Alberta?
1001 2018-10-25 21:46:14 For those who didn’t know, it’s called “natural” gas because it is so commonly found when drilling for oil. At times it has had so little value it would be burned off (flared) at the wellhead rather than be collected & sold as - natural gas.

1008 2018-10-25 21:45:06 Did not. Just artichoke and olive oil
1009 2018-10-25 21:44:59 Oh!!! I quote tweeted it sorry. OK so verdict is. It DOESN'T taste like khoresht bademjoon but it DOES taste pretty good. The aubergine saturated in the coconut oil is a pretty interesting flavour I wasn't too put off tbh
1010 2018-10-25 21:44:58 Wait what? How can you plead guilty to something that isn’t criminal? You see where your logic is flawed... Trump is a used car salesman and anyone who can’t see his rhetoric for snake oil is a chump. You know he’s a liar and you still choose to enable this man. It’s sad

1014 2018-10-25 21:44:26 Cool dude, I’m glad to hear that. But we should also vote for politicians who will encourage this, not hamper the epa.

To answer your question it’s called divestment. You stop investing in one thing to open the door for another. For instance, stop giving oil companies subsidies
1015 2018-10-25 21:44:26 There's no rivers on Mars, because the top freezes and attracts oil and dust.

1019 2018-10-25 21:43:37 I was gonna wait til Saturday to oil my scalp but this starting to itch like a mf, ion need dandruff and my scalp all the way visible
1020 2018-10-25 21:43:32 Precisely, petrol duty has been frozen for years with the oil companies continually creeping up the cost to the consumer by whatever the market will bear. Producers will always increase their margins when they can.
1021 2018-10-25 21:43:26 y’all don’t change your girls oil????
1022 2018-10-25 21:43:23 Yes! It tricks your skin into producing less oil
1023 2018-10-25 21:43:10 My thinking is the oil being in the water would make the water level higher, just like pushing a block down in a jar of water. The increased pressure has to do with the buoyancy force applied to the oil that's in the water over the added pressure head of the oil only on top.
1024 2018-10-25 21:43:03 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.

1032 2018-10-25 21:42:26 I agree. I still don’t know why so many ppl are against GM? It doesn’t have to be Chemical GM (which I’m pretty sure CL canola,wheat,barley and lentils are GM in some way?) could be frost/drought GM varieties I also herd there’s a new GM canola which is high in oil content? 1/2

1048 2018-10-25 21:39:24 We say “adulting is hard” when it comes to paying bills, making time for oil changes etc but the one responsibility that is honestly the worst is we now have our own physical mailbox to check for important stuff. It’s tasking to the point my mom still get mad at me if I forget.

1065 2018-10-25 21:37:26 Avenatti IMO was never serious about running for potus. Everything he says or does is just like the proverbial snake oil showman. He’s got way too many skeletons in his closet.
1066 2018-10-25 21:37:20 Especially if we are using it as an excuse to export more oil and natural gas overseas, rather than cutting our use.

1071 2018-10-25 21:36:41 @CTVPowerPlay amazing how the Liberals turn to oil and gas as the component that will sustain the future of the Lubicon nation.
1072 2018-10-25 21:36:37 my friend is about to dab me out w/ the oil she got from Colorado :,)
1073 2018-10-25 21:36:35 I don't understand. Why the emphasis on risk if we can still buy gas and oil from overseas? What you refer to leakage.
1074 2018-10-25 21:36:34 So, while cheaper and more efficient renewable energy technology is reducing some demand for fossil fuels, the increasing global consumption of plastic and other petrochemical products could keep oil and gas demand high - Barbara Kyle

Big Oil is in renewables too!

1078 2018-10-25 21:36:15 Need to do a oil treatment on my hair but I'm so lazy.  Natural hair is a lot of work.
1079 2018-10-25 21:35:50 Absolutely not the Saud's still have lots of oil and money to invest with friends. In capitalist societies money finally trumps all notice the machnations of the USA and the vacillation of Britain and EU, which country will take up the deficit in lost arm sales?

1084 2018-10-25 21:34:55 Much of it was out of stock at the Joe Howe store. My partner does CBD oil & was hugely disappointed. Even more disappointing is that nearly everything they offer online is 'out of stock'.

1086 2018-10-25 21:34:46 I have heard about the oil! I need to order asap. I tell myself every day I'm having a drink (or 2) when he goes to bed, and then I'm too tired to even make it 
1087 2018-10-25 21:34:44 Where can i get eucalyptus oil?
1088 2018-10-25 21:34:41 I have tried it but not to cook with. I’ll try it again! So why is it not good to cook with olive oil?
1089 2018-10-25 21:34:35 We only have a record debt 1. We had no debt, and 2. Ralph Klein's government refused to save.    Our debt is minimal and was the right reaction to the oil price crash. With Jason Kenney we would be Saskatchewan.
1090 2018-10-25 21:34:24 get him a big bone. They have these things called Mamoth Knuckles it’ll keep him distracted during the day lol. Also, try some kemp oil/treats lol it’s works too.

1093 2018-10-25 21:34:11 Get real...you're not cancelling anything. This push from all sides to punish SA with breaking the LAV contract is pure posturing. Solution is to invest in the oil resources we have & the companies that are willing to extract. Importing oil needs to stop. That's how you punish.
1094 2018-10-25 21:34:04 A new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that petrochemicals will account for more than a third of the growth in world oil demand by 2030, and nearly half the global increase by 2050.

1098 2018-10-25 21:33:33 Too much sense in one tweet, yet the people saying what they are saying are still the ones wearing Buhari media campaign Tshirts.
1099 2018-10-25 21:33:30 I like painting with oil because you can mess with it for days but that’s also bad for someone with ADD. 
I have no training and no clue what I’m doing. But I buy GIANT canvasses and then ruin them. That’s my story. I like pencil too, seem to have more control. Photography yes.
1100 2018-10-25 21:33:26 What would you recommend to hydrate the skin on top or additionally to the oil?

1103 2018-10-25 21:33:18 Just think that the same palm oil that is used for cooking is used, with some modifications, to produce biodiesel. 

That can't be good for your health.
1104 2018-10-25 21:33:11 Oil is also used to produce petrochemicals and to make materials such as plastic and fertilizer. Petrochemicals are the basis of many harmful chemicals whose use we are trying to reduce in everyday products - Barbara Kyle

Because that way you can push the oil primer in.

1125 2018-10-25 21:30:26 It would make us more oil independent.
1126 2018-10-25 21:30:17 I shred it and sweat it down with olive oil, salt and pepper. And maybe diced fresh red chilli. and stir through pesto with a good glug of decent olive oil.

1129 2018-10-25 21:29:56 Hobbies include not being able to figure out my skin and having it fluctuate between flaking like a Pillsbury biscuit & sourcing the BP oil spill
1130 2018-10-25 21:29:40 He is a sinister, dictatorial, yogurt knitting little turd. The brainwashed faithful are impervious to it, he could push your granny into traffic and they would contrive a story to justify it. He would have made a great snake oil salesman in the Wild West!

Get some beard oil and some pine tar shampoo. 
That should help.
1133 2018-10-25 21:29:01 And as the world largest producer of oil, its alliance has been very fruitful in maintaining world economic stability as well as countering anti-American forces. If step on their tails too hard they can switch side to Russia-Iran camp in OPEC and push oil prices up to $100s
1134 2018-10-25 21:28:57 I really want to know about this subsidy payment from someone in the sector. From the finance side,I know that government is paying subsidy because of the rise in global price of oil.If the government isn't paying that means that we would be buying oil at a higher price than 145
1135 2018-10-25 21:28:50 so we were scared of middle easterners in part bc of propaganda to cover our attempts to control, seize or protect oil corps-
1136 2018-10-25 21:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1137 2018-10-25 21:28:29 Modern man is addicted to modern society; we consume voraciously. Credit, oil, recreational entertainment...  If you want to see the average person act like a heroin addict in withdrawal;  take petroleum from the world for a week. Massive addiction on a global scale.
1138 2018-10-25 21:28:28 The man is a charlatan & snake oil salesman. Those are not the characteristics of a Prime Minister.

1143 2018-10-25 21:27:57 I made a kind of baked seaweed thing with it a few times which was delish. Baked in the oven with a drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of sugar and a sprinkle of salt.
Yum!
1144 2018-10-25 21:27:55 Also, can we talk for a minute about the fact that Hasan is an Indian uncle in a younger, hotter body? I can't with the fact that he still uses coconut oil.

1148 2018-10-25 21:27:44 We have no options but to rely on inter/prov.terr travel so why are we on the hook for the CT? as well we do not have option other than Heating oil that is within our means. All stores have to fly all the fresh stuff in fr. outta Ter. too.

1155 2018-10-25 21:26:20 No David. Private companies have purchased Saudi oil, along with American oil because its cheaper and more profitable. Your rhetoric and bias is getting stronger as the election gets closer.
1156 2018-10-25 21:26:18 You do realize that the Everglades Trust gave the #GOP $250K & is by developers for developers. No other env. Org has backed Ron except this one. #GOP politicians say words they don't actually believe. Have you not seen what Trump has actually done. Next up oil drilling in FL?
1157 2018-10-25 21:26:13 Noooooo

Still Naomi's twat was at issue when she spilled hand
1170 2018-10-25 21:24:16 The device from which we are writing this messages are made of oil derivatives. We use cars, buses and airplanes. The fossil fuel company is easier to blame, but it exists because we use their products.

1172 2018-10-25 21:24:00 John’s lips tickled at my ear, his breath like hot oil across my neck. “He kissed me.” My heart ached, my mouth running dry, but another whisper lingered unspoken before spilling forth, “& I realized I was in love with someone else, someone I can never have.”

1177 2018-10-25 21:22:48 I think the title of the day is "oil and gas energy", not just energy. Don't give up, Andrew.
1178 2018-10-25 21:22:46 Should also note that during the nuclear rollout, France doubled electricity production to also reduce fossil fuel used for space heating. They would have gone even further but the oil price crashed.

1226 2018-10-25 21:16:48 Well, "worthless" may be a bit strong, but it's certainly not a viable source of tax income in comparison to say, land-based oil wells in the middle east.

1238 2018-10-25 21:15:53 Have you heard of medical CBD oil? That’s what medical marijuana is all about just in case you don’t know. In Ohio for instance, you can’t smoke it. Edibles, oils & vaping are legal if you qualify for a med marijuana card.
1239 2018-10-25 21:15:53 We shouldn’t import anything from Saudi Arabia. There is no need for us to support a totalitarian, extremist, police state.... especially when we can produce oil here, at home, and keep $ in our own economy.

1247 2018-10-25 21:15:01 Jesse should have spent yr or two in AHL.  But oil had no talent there, so playing JP with slugs wasn’t option. Chia has rebuilt with more skill at F.  More viable now but not option then.

1270 2018-10-25 21:12:06 #auspol Kangaroos "gobble up" feed on farms, says Morrison. But the future drought fund will assist "on farm" water (yes, he said it, twice) issues..... #ABC This is a great interview  @SabraLane He's fast talking like a snake oil salesman....
1271 2018-10-25 21:12:04 I have to remember what the date is and say it in videos now because if the likes of him. I can guess what he said. My camera won't date stamp video only stills . Shocking really.

1274 2018-10-25 21:11:38 3. Lemon - rub a piece of lemon onto your eyebrows and leave it on for 20 minutes. Wash off with warm water!

4. Olive oil - apply a drop of this for each eyebrow and rub in with your fingertips, keep it on for about 2 hours then wash off with a face wash!
1275 2018-10-25 21:11:30 I guess I’ll start my day at 5 p.m. considering all I did today was get my oil changed and go back to sleep 
1276 2018-10-25 21:11:29 Broccoli, kale and Brussels sprouts are super good at 450 for like 20 mins! toss w olive oil and salt and pepper, brings out such a nice simple flavor
1277 2018-10-25 21:11:28 Birthday blessings @DrJoeAbah. Thank you for all you do. May your oil never run dry
1278 2018-10-25 21:11:19 Assad did not gas his own people. Some of us are well travelled and connected. We know Russia stands in the way of the Western money cartel breaking up these countries to steal their oil and natural gas and put pipelines over their destroyed communities. Screw the outcry. -LIES!
1279 2018-10-25 21:10:50 Don't punish the Canadian taxpayers for #MBS. Stop the importation of Saudi oil!

i'd pay for that if i had money.

1288 2018-10-25 21:09:39 A legal amount of recreational cannabis is permitted (30g or less). Cannabis oil is subject to the liquid restrictions – 100 ml (3.4 oz.) or smaller container permitted in carry-on.
1289 2018-10-25 21:09:39 Portugal was meant to be an example of EU success As I have already explained, the ECB allowed QE through buying bonds. Cheap oil boosted the economy reliant on imports, tourism improved.
All Gov budgets have done so far is limit austerity not reverse it
1290 2018-10-25 21:09:38 Of course they support the cash grab by @JustinTrudeau under the #fake #carbontax scheme, the big oil and gas  companies just pass it to consumer, they know that it is in most cases a life neccesity. Shame on them #BusinessCouncil #cdnpoli

1298 2018-10-25 21:08:56 My dad told me @thelittleidiot used to do something where he would license his music to car and oil companies and then turn around and donate that money to green groups. So that is how you do it.

1300 2018-10-25 21:08:45 You are noticing a certain percentage that the press focus on making them appear larger than they are. Apparently 30% of our population are brainwashed by Fox news because they are stupid or evil. And we elected a snake oil salesman. We are a mess. I can  hope a majority prevails
1301 2018-10-25 21:08:41 Tough on Crime? And exactly how much crime do they have in Alaska? Are you also saying Mike is for damaging the lands, drilling for oil, killing animals, polluting the air?
1302 2018-10-25 21:08:40 1. Caster Oil - massage a few drops of this on your eyebrows with your fingertips, keep this on for 30 minutes and wash off!

2. Coconut Oil - dip a cotton swab in the oil and apply it to your eyebrows, do this before bed and keep it on overnight! Rinse the next day with water.
1303 2018-10-25 21:08:27 Spilling olbas oil on face & lips is particularly unpleasant - should be avoided 
1304 2018-10-25 21:08:22 Someone was complaining that no one in the Calgary Top 40 under 40 is from the oil & gas sector. Well I'm pretty sure there aren't any city employees either but that kind of isn't the point, regardless these folks have accomplished great things! #congrats #yyc @AvenueMagazine
1305 2018-10-25 21:08:18 thanks, wasn't meaning to use oil as eye drops, rather to take it orally but, like I said, found articles mentioning it but never a link or mention of an actual company or product :/
1306 2018-10-25 21:08:16 How about one with R2 squirting oil like he did in "Revenge of the Sith?"

1308 2018-10-25 21:08:06 These dudes really jocing with us at this oil change place.
1309 2018-10-25 21:08:03 There is zero way to “responsibly” use oil. It ALWAYS leaks and it is destroying the clinate systems of our earth.
1310 2018-10-25 21:07:53 The narrative from swift seems to be collaboration. November is going to be really interesting. I believe it will happen without ripple and swift ever getting along. 3rd parties will oil the the engine. Swift trying to buy time and ripple trying to take their market share.
1311 2018-10-25 21:07:53 The Foreign Office also invited BP in on 6 November 2002 to talk about opportunities in Iraq “post regime change”. Its minutes state: “Iraq is the big oil prospect. BP is desperate to get in there and anxious that political deals should not deny them the opportunity.”
1312 2018-10-25 21:07:48 Hope Oil tol 
1313 2018-10-25 21:07:41 The same oil is in bbq sauce, margarine, and salad dressing, as well as meat alternatives.
1314 2018-10-25 21:07:37 Of course they would get a bulk discount. And that discount will get lower and lower - wise to wait! (Most unfortunate that someone with "OIL" in their name is behind all of these machinations, Judith!)  (Btw - how many wetlands have u dried up lately?)
1315 2018-10-25 21:07:36 Coconut oil did nothing for my face but make me a grease ball.
1316 2018-10-25 21:07:35 People I have seen use peel off base coats and... some sort of nail oil!
1317 2018-10-25 21:07:23 Hot take of the day.  The solution to the Caravan (and our excess elites that are driving us crazy) is Colonialism. 

Make this generation of Harvard grads solve Venezuela directly. Pitch it to Trump as the oil will pay for it. @bdomenech
1318 2018-10-25 21:07:22 Just heard an ad for “Ladies’ Day” at a car shop offering women discounts on oil changes and other deals on Thursdays... glad someone is finally realizing we can’t afford full priced services with this wage gap
1319 2018-10-25 21:07:17 ‘Data is the new oil, and it’s only going to become more politicized’ - wise closing words at #FCFestival
1320 2018-10-25 21:06:53 If I come across any articles or anecdotes I’ll let you know. I’d be careful with just any oil because if it contains essential oils like some do it can be harmful to the eyes. Diluted or not.
1321 2018-10-25 21:06:52 Just been doing some research to let the guys on lse know I mean business. Read the back of a can of wd40 and will be advising Steve Sanderson about how to do oil in the morning #ukog

1323 2018-10-25 21:06:44 Silicon Valley tech companies are the oil barons of the 21st century -- with an extra pretense of moral superiority.
1324 2018-10-25 21:06:38 " Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, Sell the Oil and Pay your debt; and you and your Sons live on the rest." 2nd Kings 4:7 NKJV Bible.

1325 2018-10-25 21:06:29 Hoisin smeared on to pancake first. Filling must be a combo of crispy skin & moist duck pieces. Then, slivers of cucumber & spring onion. The critical element- often overlooked- is a few drops of chilli oil for piquancy. #jamfirst

1330 2018-10-25 21:06:13 Have you considered vegetable oil? Its a little easier on the budget while still giving the same effect.

1334 2018-10-25 21:05:17 Not mine either. There are uranium reserves in CAR, however Russian firms wouldn't likely win contracts. France would pressure the gov't heavily. Likelier is diamonds/gold, chance for future oil concessions, and lots of minerals that are under-mined in CAR from underdevelopment.
1335 2018-10-25 21:05:16 Sir,stop insulting beast. Beast can be deadly but won't behave in such immoral manner. Such character is beneath the beast and should be sentence to death in a gruesome manner. I suggest through Acid or they fry him in hot oil alive.
1336 2018-10-25 21:05:02 If there is ever a pinkish colour in your oil, it’s because there is moisture in the oil. Service the oil and the filter at regular intervals.

1339 2018-10-25 21:04:53 That's not a typo. This guy has gone through his entire life thinking actual snake oil salesmen were actually selling piles of snakes to cure men's ills.

1344 2018-10-25 21:04:17 Maybe the people commenting on this post need to find different employment. The oil and gas industry has been failing for a few years now. The average person knows that if there is no new jobs in a certain area, it is time to move on.  Whining about it is not going to change it!

1347 2018-10-25 21:04:06 Don’t bother to send memes. They r meaningless. Just tell me in ur own words about the righteousness of a political party being owned by an oil refining company, a corrupt casino magnate, a right wing hedge fund manager & a totally immoral lobbyist 4 the gun industry. I’ll wait.
1348 2018-10-25 21:03:57 Especially if you’re going vegan you don’t realize that vegan cheeses are actually awful for you and filled with canola oil, etc. and these companies all do this while tricking you into thinking that bc it’s plant based it’s healthy- it’s not! :(
1349 2018-10-25 21:03:53 In the G&M reference it stated 24K for renewable and 22k for Oil Sands. Very incorrect, 46k in OS camps alone, another 30k remote. That is only oil sands, another ~120k in conventional O&G in Ab alone. Plus all support (eng, manufacturing, pipeline, sales, trucking, etc.).

Leafy greens and olive oil does not a side salad make.
You call it simple.
I call it lazy.
If I'm paying over $12 for a basic AF sandwich and side salad at least put a tomato in there you cheap bastards.
1356 2018-10-25 21:03:17 your reaction when Josh wanted to put oil into the slow cooker made this.

1371 2018-10-25 21:01:55 @Earth_Challenge Why can we carry oil in pipelines from Canada to the US and other places, but we cannot do the same with water? Why couldn't we have pipes running between states, and when area gets too much rain, catch that rain, and send it out to places that need water?!?

1375 2018-10-25 21:01:27 Only one refinery buys that oil, Irving. They could use Nfld oil but they choose Saudi. 

And Energy East was an export pipeline and it was killed by economics. It simply doesn't make sense to ship oil 5000kms across the country at current prices and with Keystone and Line 3.

1379 2018-10-25 21:00:50 Yes, their is a danger in transporting crude oil in the air because if it spills or leaks it could be very harmful and dangerous, I think ships are the preferred method because there is more storage room for the crude oil and less of a risk on endangering people #UCBAMKTG2080

1398 2018-10-25 20:58:59 He is particularly vile Heid.

I'd say the worst I came across in LSE.
1399 2018-10-25 20:58:55 Prophets with excess Ego hmm I don't placr God place that  in u with his oil.
That isn't God
1400 2018-10-25 20:58:50 I need an oil change too
1401 2018-10-25 20:58:48 Why is ur boy Mike afraid to debate his Dem opponent @MarkBegich ? Afraid to defend his opposition to protecting salmon habitats, a major part of Alaskan economy? Dunleavy wants more oil/gas drilling in these habitats. Anything for a buck, amirite Spanky? No wonder u support him
1402 2018-10-25 20:58:39 And were you saying that about oil when he scored in our euro play off 2nd leg  don't single out 2 players when we draw if you won't single out the same 2 players when they win games for us 
1403 2018-10-25 20:58:32 If you pull out of the arms deal you have to  stop buying oil from them too.  You can't turn a blind eye  @JustinTrudeau . #nohalfmeasures
1404 2018-10-25 20:58:24 cannot agree more however will the comments lord Sugar made apply to Scottish Ref in 14 where many lies were told to the people especially the one that Scotland would be kept in the #EU if it voted No. Or the other lies about pensions, oil etc.  Time for #indyref2
1405 2018-10-25 20:58:08 Japanese government works for its people! American government works for corporations. Oil companies and car makers in America will never allow 'a better and faster public transportation system'!
1406 2018-10-25 20:58:07 Get into the oil field 
1407 2018-10-25 20:58:04 We hope that a dip with our spooky treat allowed you to close your eyes and relax while the lavender oil helped ease your mind, love! 
1408 2018-10-25 20:57:59 Oul goat not oil...Twitter doesn't speak Irish lingo
1409 2018-10-25 20:57:25 Ewww oil or blood
1410 2018-10-25 20:57:19 Brilliant idea. Bunch of assholes proud of themselves for shooting a harmless oil goat out eating it's dinner.
1411 2018-10-25 20:57:17 It’s always fun checking out Bill Seitz’s campaign finance reports. He was awarded handsomely yet again by the coal/oil/natural gas industries for dismantling Ohio’s wind energy sector. Why is a State Rep from Cincy getting so many contributions from Houston, TX?
1412 2018-10-25 20:57:15 Why are NDP in #HoC #QP? Anti oil and hate Saudis. Nothing else
1413 2018-10-25 20:57:13 wish ths ppl knew how fun it is to put itchy poisen oak oil on the signs at my house.. I feel if they can give me their time,  to touch my property,  I can give them reason to keep their hands to theirselves. All over their itchy selves.. hope they keep their hands out of pants.
1414 2018-10-25 20:57:07 I actually don’t have any truffle oil left. I’ve used all it making your fries 
I’ll get some more today.

1418 2018-10-25 20:56:32 Omg me except my sons skin broke out & is it his baby body wash? The lotion? Coconut oil? Laundry detergent? New formula? His 2 month vaccines? Eczema????
1419 2018-10-25 20:56:28 Welp. Cold. Can't sleep. So I'll do some dozy drawin' while huffing china oil.
1420 2018-10-25 20:56:05 I don’t advocate for marijuana legalization so that I can smoke, but because there are so many health and medical benefits. So that I don’t have to see someone I love so messed up because they were prescribed a “synthetic CBD oil”
1421 2018-10-25 20:56:00 Where you live, if you still have a gasoline/diesel powered car, see if you can avoid filling up on Saudi oil.  While you have the choice fill up with Iranian or other oil.  #RememberKashogi
1422 2018-10-25 20:55:56 The chicken def didn’t cross the road for vape oil in tuakau
1423 2018-10-25 20:55:55 not politically correct but   Suspicious packages, Timing is everything just before election to distract from left wing violence no worries its the democrat new and improved #metoo we don't believe the coordinated stage faux bomb hoax smell like skunk oil
1424 2018-10-25 20:55:45 Or do it Persian style!!! Par boil. Oil in pan, then line with baking paper, then more oil and the rice, put dish cloth on the lid so it really SEALS shut, steam it, and it GOES DELICIOUS BURNEDY at the bottom!
1425 2018-10-25 20:55:43 First cake of the week for Claire who loves her bath, wine, Neom candles, hotel chocolat chocolates and Espa bath oil xx
1426 2018-10-25 20:55:32 Coconut oil and almond oil bath 
1427 2018-10-25 20:55:13 Que banned oil exploration.
Quebec & Trudeau kept changing pipeline rules till Energy East gave up. Mission Accomplished! Stopped a  pipeline & could stop foreign oil especially 11 ‘/,  murdering Saudi’s bring in & that would increase gas prices!
BTW we now own a pipeline to BC
1428 2018-10-25 20:55:10 I'm truly a 20 year old who's taking vitamins, getting my car's oil changed, regularly deep-cleaning my bathroom... I'm out here trying to make my momma proud
1429 2018-10-25 20:55:05 Apparently in case of US, the price of a hundreds is the oil.
1430 2018-10-25 20:54:54 “No of course I don’t put ranch on a salad. I use olive oil and lemon like a f*cking adult.” -My professor today during our seminar
1431 2018-10-25 20:54:53 È tempo di raccogliere le olive, è tempo di olio nuovo in #abruzzo!

It is time to make new oil!

1432 2018-10-25 20:54:52 Maybe everyone’s head isn’t as fucked. Where’s the 50mg vape oil at?
1433 2018-10-25 20:54:51 Bamber, Professor Yakkal, Harry Hill, Wee Frank, Oil Tank, McCaff and these we’re just for the one person!! @naomheoinclg legend 
1434 2018-10-25 20:54:49 Conditioner (Man & Tail) and beard oil
1435 2018-10-25 20:54:45 Need some oil for these braids. My scalp is itching
1436 2018-10-25 20:54:41 You make your own mind up,not knocking your investment at all,I am in Angus Dor and Ukog,but this bunch tried to hide BB problems and have caught lots of people in at 7p and they never never question the delays on site,I read rns and look at pics and think WTF
1437 2018-10-25 20:54:32 Fresh detail got Kiesha looking nice . All she needs is an oil change.
1438 2018-10-25 20:54:30 I thought it was acceptable to buy a g of oil this morning... Lmao
1439 2018-10-25 20:54:29 @PressTV Where can people in the US and other countries fill up their tank with Iranian oil before this embargo takes effect on November 5th?
1440 2018-10-25 20:54:27 When you come to the shop dont rush me to do a oil change ill make you wait even longer
1441 2018-10-25 20:54:23 Okay, so my brief experimentation with THC/CBD oil is at an end.  All side effects (negative), no benefits = what's the point?  #CannabisLegalization #cannabiscanada
1442 2018-10-25 20:54:11 Mattis also took a six-figure board seat on Theranos to get the DoD to buy that snake oil, so he's not really setting that high a standard here
1443 2018-10-25 20:54:08 It’s a different world over hea ay.
They don’t even sell vape oil in the dairy’s
1444 2018-10-25 20:54:05 Stir in eight pinches of olive oil and bring to a boil.
1445 2018-10-25 20:54:01  oil from his hands if he’s a mechanic or something
1446 2018-10-25 20:53:57 My house uses paper plates for sandwiches and things like that (no juice, no oil, etc).They provide quick clean up and we always have them on hand. All other food needs a real plate!
1447 2018-10-25 20:53:57 Remember where the Saudi’s money comes from before you pass judgement. If you use oil you’ve given them money. Also remember that the USA and the U.K. sell the Saudi’s weapons. Shipping Shawn Michaels over is the least of the problems with Saudi Arabia
1448 2018-10-25 20:53:47 What is zance dare?
1449 2018-10-25 20:53:34 Lol I brought the maple syrup in to bring some levity to the conversation, but again, how sure are you that Canada’s economy would be just fine without California contributing to your tv/film and gas enterprises. Last I checked oil was very good to some of your ppl as is tv/film
1450 2018-10-25 20:53:11 “Today, we talk about oil. We all need to be educated. Nigeria is not an oil-rich country. It’s nowhere near that. First of all, as a percentage of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP), oil is less than 15 percent.
1451 2018-10-25 20:53:08 Should I get an oil change or buy a whiskey that I’ve been eying for awhile
1452 2018-10-25 20:53:00 Kudos to whoever is pasting over the I-1631 signs with “paid for by big oil” in Bellevue. Good praxis
1453 2018-10-25 20:52:56 The power of oil!
1454 2018-10-25 20:52:54 computer glasses and peppermint oil 
1455 2018-10-25 20:52:53 It's infuriating how half-assed we are. The Sharks mic a guy every few games, the Pens, Bruins, Sabres do their own Oil Change type series. We get a tweet with an emoji at the end, on a good day, or fluff videos about how world class Studio 99 is to sell a $45 buffet.
1456 2018-10-25 20:52:53 Can you please answer this for me, because no one else will. 
Does the government of Canada buy oil from the Saudis?
Or do private companies like @irvingoil buy it?
1457 2018-10-25 20:52:45 Be glad it was not oil.
1458 2018-10-25 20:52:33 I use apple cider vinegar (any brand) and half water, with drops of tea tree oil before bed and in the morning I spray rose petal witch hazel on. It works wonders.
1459 2018-10-25 20:52:32 Whatever has gone on is very unfair on present day shareholders in #angs and #ukog I think Adrian Pete and all  do an amazing job but I think I speak for most investors here that we dont want to hear the arguing or either #angs or #ukog put down when they are our investment.
1460 2018-10-25 20:52:23 So all you people in the comments are boycotting Saudi oil right? You’re making sure you’re not buying their oil when you fill u? And youre all writing to your senators about that billion dollar arms deal the US still has with Saudi Arabia right?
1461 2018-10-25 20:52:19 GEJ sacked Sanusi as the CBN Governor because he told us that billions of oil money was missing which turned out to be true and appointed Emefiele to replace him.

Buhari came few months later and retained Emefiele, a Delta born Christian yet that Buhari is vengeful.
1462 2018-10-25 20:52:15 “Yeen said sh*t slick to ah can ah oil”
1463 2018-10-25 20:52:09 So all you people in the comments are boycotting Saudi oil right? You’re making sure you’re not buying their oil when you fill u? And youre all writing to your senators about that billion dollar arms deal the US still has with Saudi Arabia right?
1464 2018-10-25 20:52:04 That’s your skin clearing up lol. It sounds like it doesn’t make sense but, once your face starts getting clean the dirt/oil surfaces and you break out.

1466 2018-10-25 20:51:41 Paid for rent, bought and did an oil change and now getting a haircut... So much money in one day... But 2 weeks to get paid... 
1467 2018-10-25 20:51:41 I’ve never tried jojoba but literally my entire life changed when I started actually washing my face with coconut oil and then gentle soap, and then moisturizing with coconut oil at night. I could never go without makeup before but I do all the time now and my skins less oily
1468 2018-10-25 20:51:30 In a few years all of these people will be held accountable for what they’ve done to humanity. Some will be dead by then, but some will live to enjoy jail. This includes Trump, all dirty oil companies and ICE car maker executives. It will get so ugly that  it can’t go unpunished.
1469 2018-10-25 20:51:29 We aren't getting paid for it at the level we expect. But then our oil isn't of a type that a lot of buyers want. We have a rich economy that will thrive, even if our oil production is stable or declines.
1470 2018-10-25 20:51:28 General Electric. Standard Oil. bring back this aesthetic
1471 2018-10-25 20:51:18 Why an enduring U.S. oil spill can't be stopped
1472 2018-10-25 20:51:16 Not sure if a chain would be more efficient, no hysteresis, but chains are heavy and you have rotate that mass. I assume cost, belts are cheap, and work well. Perhaps due to lubrication as well. Don’t see external chains on cars, most are oil bathed.
1473 2018-10-25 20:50:54 Someone threw omega three at me.. Lucky the injury was only super fish oil..  ( promise no more as bad as this one )
1474 2018-10-25 20:50:48 I've had to call the insurance company to push it along, and had to call the dr to press the insurance company. Insurance bureaucracy is a pain but which pain is worse? Squeaky wheel gets the oil - you can do it! Fight for your needs!
1475 2018-10-25 20:50:43 You just proved his point, also it is very easy to dispute the dumb talking point of Iraq being about Halliburton's profit margin, the oil explicitly  remained in Iraq's custody.
1476 2018-10-25 20:50:21 Oil
1477 2018-10-25 20:50:14 Unnatural and freaky as shit. Just eat tofu or fish if they're not yet poisoned with mercury or plastic or oil and real soya or beans and legumes. Organic fruit and vegetables and sing in the shower. Enough!
1478 2018-10-25 20:50:05 We do kale chips in our air fryer ; get rid of the middle stork , just the leaf , little oil and air fryer on 160 for about 3 to 5 minutes . A bit of salt and pepper and yes I was converted ( initially very sceptical)

1481 2018-10-25 20:49:45 Sold out of C B D oil but can Definitely get more.

1486 2018-10-25 20:48:48 But we, as in America, just did last year, so an oil company could build a pipeline. I see you are from Sweden and think this is an issue of the past but it isn't.
1487 2018-10-25 20:48:43 So all you people in the comments are boycotting Saudi oil right? You’re making sure you’re not buying their oil when you fill u? And youre all writing to your senators about that billion dollar arms deal the US still has with Saudi Arabia right?

1489 2018-10-25 20:48:23 The Dr. Oz show is WILD. He goes from a segment on whether or not coconut oil is bad for you to Casey Anthony's parents speaking out with very little transition
1490 2018-10-25 20:48:21 AK with #cf97 was a good man doing his best.  N-Rod is a snake oil salesman, and a poor one at that.
1491 2018-10-25 20:48:17 use olive oil
1492 2018-10-25 20:48:12 @DearAuntCrabby says you should use lots of olive oil spray in the pan when cooking Kale. That way it will slide into the trash can easier.
1493 2018-10-25 20:47:58 Failing and failed govt is just so easy in their mouth like this country was not ran aground just 3yrs ago here when both federal and state govts could not pay salaries after mismanaging oil windfall
They think everyone suffers amnesia, maybe they need videos of daily bomb blasts
1494 2018-10-25 20:47:52 Alberta had very little money in the bank, compared to what was planned before Mr Klein cut back savings. Alberta oil production IS at record levels. (check it out). Mr Kenney doesn't understand economics, he only does soundbites and memes.
1495 2018-10-25 20:47:52 Mais c'est tellement évident, si le politique dit non, c'est non ! Regerde NDDL, il y avait des engagements aussi... Non, ce sont des enfumeurs, des menteurs et des lâches qui augmentent les taxes gaz oil au détriments de ceux qui bossent mais laisse le grand capital se gaver !!!
1496 2018-10-25 20:47:43 FYI, coconut oil makes a good eye-makeup remover, especially when it comes to glitter   (gentle, natural & chemical-free)
1497 2018-10-25 20:47:41 Shhh. He’s forgotten to PayPal me for the oil 
1498 2018-10-25 20:47:25 I don't have much hair, but my face looks like a smudged oil painting
1499 2018-10-25 20:46:52 You talk about oil-rich countries, today Saudi Arabia has a population of about 30million and it produces more than 10million barrels of oil per day. That is one barrel of oil for every three citizens. That is what you call an oil-rich country.

Emir of kano
1500 2018-10-25 20:46:45 I recall us spanking you 3-0
At Portman Rd under GG around 99/00, your fans booed non stop about him. It’s like trying to mix oil and water
1501 2018-10-25 20:46:35 i wish my car would be like “pls get your oil changed” and then when i rlly need it be like “OIL CHANGE NOW” i’m sick of guessing
1502 2018-10-25 20:46:28 Absolutely love your water cream, dewy mist, and cleansing oil!!! 
1503 2018-10-25 20:46:10 Hi Scotty: I have a Mitsubishi Pajero; 220,000km on it. Engine oil has been changed regularly. But, alas, automatic transmission fluid has never been changed. Should I change it now? what's the risk of it slipping if i do? and if I don't, what's the risk of transmission failing?
1504 2018-10-25 20:46:09 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
1505 2018-10-25 20:45:53 @telfordk I hope PMJT understands to interfere with  Lav contract will cause 3000 Canadians to lose their jobs.  While doing nothing to punish the Saudis. Hard to understand why the PM/ Freeland see their image as champions of HR more important than Canadians.  Don't by Saudi oil
1506 2018-10-25 20:45:50 People always tell me I smell good but I don’t use any type of perfume or anything  y’all smelling coconut oil and facial products
1507 2018-10-25 20:45:38 Getting my oil changed was just stressful like wtf
1508 2018-10-25 20:45:22 Who's voice is that? Oh no ! 
#Barnaby is on air. I need a break. Too many snake oil salesmen  already in #auspol
#rnbreakfast
1509 2018-10-25 20:45:15 Funny that coz it was said that somebody got it wrong and oil wasn't a bonus but part of the financial equation
1510 2018-10-25 20:45:05 I can trump that with THC oil and a banana. 

My face feels like cobwebs.

1513 2018-10-25 20:44:54 I love that she used oil paints! There's nothing like them!
1514 2018-10-25 20:44:50 Mike has taken money from oil to sell off his state!!  Very corrupt!! Sad!!
1515 2018-10-25 20:44:43 Obviously no one knows how the planetary system works, but we know it is a system. Read Donella Meadows. Systems have elements, interconnections, and purpose. The elements are the simplest parts, so our best hope is eliminating the elements (oil companies) that are breaking it.

1525 2018-10-25 20:43:04 *whispers* Turkish oil wrestling 
1526 2018-10-25 20:42:57 They are doing this because the regional/local oil field trucks are literally parking all over the place anywhere they can. Including taking over Truckstop parking lots. This  has a Domino effect and impacts OTR drivers.
1527 2018-10-25 20:42:55 For oil/Russia

1531 2018-10-25 20:42:41 — oil within my reach against the wall as strings of curse words pour themselves out through my tense lips.] I hope you’re enjoying this because it’ll be the last time you ever enjoy anything. [A few deep —
1532 2018-10-25 20:42:22 The biggest problem is the services related to oil and gas, more than 3 years now, but never recovered yet. Many Albertan are still out of work.
1533 2018-10-25 20:42:20 I make own and include castor oil and rose or Lavendar oil.
1534 2018-10-25 20:42:13 Instead, consider going after the special benefits fossil fuel companies get to even out the field. That includes direct subsidies, but also indirect subsidies like not being liable (or not significantly) for oil spills and other pollution.
1535 2018-10-25 20:42:10 I TEACH HIM THAT HIS SKIN BLACK LIKE OIL, THAT’S FOR ROYALTY
1536 2018-10-25 20:42:01 Mother in law uses the oil and never used gas bottle for a long time. I’d assume it’s cheaper In the long term. Shop about for the oil prices every time you need as the fluctuate, she uses Wallace oils. And make sure if you do have a tank make sure it’s secure.
1537 2018-10-25 20:41:44 the soak and float shampoo bar is made for a sensitive/dry scalp but my personal favorite has been seanik cus i feel it helps balance the dryness of my scalp and the oil in my hair 

you’ll go over all of them tho during training and can sample a few for yourself to try out 
1538 2018-10-25 20:41:36 Just another snake oil salesman pitch.

1540 2018-10-25 20:41:35 It is about oil and nothing else.
1541 2018-10-25 20:41:22 Vatika coconut oil mostly. It’s already infused with a lot of stuff.

1560 2018-10-25 20:39:51 Is it normal practice for salon owners, hair stylists, olaplex educators to add another company’s oil to an @olaplex treatment?  Is this a thing???
1561 2018-10-25 20:39:43 Has @arinaitwerach also been robbed by the other Arab kind of TV? Whatever the oil money is causing on market isn't good.
1562 2018-10-25 20:39:39 I'll have to look into the oil boiler option then. I gather it must be a fair bit cheaper than gas bottles then?
1563 2018-10-25 20:39:30 Policies focused on self-sufficiency so far as possible, including re-expanding coal production and research and development into synthetic oil to achieve energy independence.
1564 2018-10-25 20:39:24 Angus would...........?
1565 2018-10-25 20:39:11 We are already self sufficient in renewable energy...oil is a bonus
1566 2018-10-25 20:39:07 Allegations of Discovered oil in the Ardoyne is there?
1567 2018-10-25 20:38:49 They shouldn’t have been allowed in in the first place. Totally incompatible beliefs. Oil and water do not mix.
1568 2018-10-25 20:38:40 yeah, I'll def look into tinctures or something. the only thing I've found that seems to help is peppermint oil.
1569 2018-10-25 20:38:32 I would be okay with it if it works for you. Oil companies have money and lots of smart/skilled scientists. Lots of bad stuff obviously, but still an integral part of modern society.

1577 2018-10-25 20:37:58 Alberta had money in the bank prior to NDP.  We also had a heritage fund. Calgary used to get surplus checks.  O&G is not in record production that I can assure to you. Our oil sells at a fraction of the market price. The only record NDP is setting is our debt......

1589 2018-10-25 20:37:06 Well, there has been global research done over the last 127 years into if oil is renewable or finite. It is believed by many that it is renewable but at slower rate then we are consuming it. Which still leaves us with a paradox.
1590 2018-10-25 20:36:57 Ah yes I have, I was the first to take a pic when brockham ground work started,Also it was the first time I came into contact with Bigdaddyian and caristom,the two biggest Ukog wankers ever,and all the bad feeling started from that moment because they were worried Angus would

I also regret the denigration of Corbyn coming from some parts of the PLP & others.  This is why Corbyn people are touchy.
1624 2018-10-25 20:32:07 That's absurd. The need to borrow was because of the lack of planning or saving by previous PC governments. The oil and gas industry is fine, with record production. The boom may be over, but that's the way booms are.

1658 2018-10-25 20:29:18 ... fast-tracking a resurrected #EnergyEast pipeline, making Canada independent of the daily import of hundreds of thousands barrels of Saudi oil, stands a much better chance to send a clear message.

1664 2018-10-25 20:28:48 How does @MikeDunleavyGov feel about climate change as one of the biggest oil producing states??? #NoTrumpNWay
1665 2018-10-25 20:28:48 Or maybe stop making Saudi & your buddies at Irving Oil rich on blood money when there is a perfect alternative that’s ethical & actually has environmental standards right her in f&$@ing Canada
1666 2018-10-25 20:28:45 ONNIT MCT oil
1667 2018-10-25 20:28:44 Ur mcm uses bio oil on his face with the best car themed song on this has to do….
1668 2018-10-25 20:28:22 Vote for Mike and make big oil great again!
1669 2018-10-25 20:28:19 Brakes Oil and Some more. Don’t get in my shit if U ain’t wit dat Shit.
1670 2018-10-25 20:28:18 You don't need a script or anything, how do you know how much to take? Sorry I'm totally Naive when it comes to this. I don't want to smoke it, but I heard you could get oil, I guess for brownies
1671 2018-10-25 20:28:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
1672 2018-10-25 20:28:15 Today’s lesson learned: just because your car tells you your oils life doesn’t mean you keep driving past the 3 months mark for an oil change, lol otherwise you’ll end up having to pay even more because you need an engine flush 
1673 2018-10-25 20:28:14 You've been the beneficiary of a double bubble, the bubble of the oil sands boom, and the bubble of inflated house prices and speculative buying and building. Please don't ask the rest of us to keep your industry in boom conditions forever. Booms end, bubbles burst.
1674 2018-10-25 20:28:14 The last general inflation episode was 1973 and the oil "crisis", an external influence. Look at the deficite spending that Japan's government runs. No inflation there! The duopoly lie through their teeth or are just plain incompetent!
1675 2018-10-25 20:27:55 X-Files black oil. Or you had a dilated eye exam. You have strange prep techniques. :-)
1676 2018-10-25 20:27:52 If it involves selling oil or gas we shouldn't even try. #leaveitintheground
1677 2018-10-25 20:27:35 @DrewOnTheRadio The reason we're dependent on Saudi Arabia for oil is because we're dependent on oil. As a nation we have vehemently resisted all alternatives so the politicians can keep sucking at ExxonMobil's teat.
1678 2018-10-25 20:27:33 Gillum called all of Trump supporters "From The Gutter".Mayor Gillum is a real racist & divider!We don't want Socialism or Open Borders.He is just another trouble making Divider. In debate Gillum was talking about being anointed with oil, Christians are not racist dividers!
1679 2018-10-25 20:27:32 Don’t let Saudi Arabia get away with killing Khashoggi. They must be punished. Stop your lies and BS rhetoric. You want Saudi oil to offset the shut off of Iranian oil after plans to sanction Iran in November. Sanction Saudi Arabia, protect the press. #MagnitskyActSaudiArabi
1680 2018-10-25 20:27:25 well the line is obviously busy to Spain because he hasn't answered my question....

Mister Fawlty....he no nothing.

1683 2018-10-25 20:26:49 For 2°C consider this: car production will hit 100 million per year, oil demand will cross 100 million bpd, CO2 crossed 100 million tons per day. Global C emission are still growing, no end in sight!

1685 2018-10-25 20:26:45 I lived in Sarawak on a oil camp when I was a kid. The main memory I have is we used to borrow a 4WD from a friend and drive up the beach from Miri to Brunei to get groceries as there were not many shops where we lived.
1686 2018-10-25 20:26:37 Prohibiting offshore oil drilling and vaping indoors for question 9. Dang these legislators are crafty!
1687 2018-10-25 20:26:37 Means, Motive, and Opportunity. The suspects closest to the 9/11 crime scene(s) had direct ties to people with the most to benefit. They made $Billions off Oil and the War on Terror.

If your house gets robbed, everyone who had access or a key becomes a suspect...
1688 2018-10-25 20:26:35 nah, left-wing violence is hyped up to scare you. and when there is actual left-wing terrorism, they target property (like oil infrastructure, big ag operations), not people. unlike right-wing extremists and terrorists
1689 2018-10-25 20:26:31 And if you thought essential oil was superior enough you can now buy the organic kind.
1690 2018-10-25 20:26:27 When dad buys you oil and changes it  #blessyou
1691 2018-10-25 20:26:23 The initiative isn't perfect, but it's a starting point. A pragmatist, adaptive management approach is to get going NOW with the best you've got and modify as you learn. Time is short. Sad to see @CliffMass author the "no" argument with the major oil companies and Koch Bros.
1692 2018-10-25 20:26:18 Get an olive oils sprey, or coconut oil spray.  I use those all the time
1693 2018-10-25 20:26:10 someone mail me some CBD oil thanks
1694 2018-10-25 20:25:51 I have wander blocked. He is one of them that ganged up and mass reported me on #angus LSE .  I can't see his abuse anymore. Its heaven :)
1695 2018-10-25 20:25:51 @DrewOnTheRadio the U.S. gets less than 6% of our oil from SA. This guy is an idiot
1696 2018-10-25 20:25:31 Scottish oil will last a lot longer than that!
1697 2018-10-25 20:25:16 Had a great giggles with @carmichaeltimo1 in the velo shed, good progress made, front wheel out, identified brakes slightly out of balance so should be simple fix, in other news fork solder has a crack in it and leaking oil so more thoughts and research required for a repair plan
1698 2018-10-25 20:25:06 Tennessee? Big threat of oil spills off the shore of Tennessee?
1699 2018-10-25 20:25:00 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.

1701 2018-10-25 20:24:57 Bankster-set sip rates are killing the business of racing.  To get close racing we don’t need budget caps or tech restrictions- we need refueling and max power the whole race without the need to burn oil.

1709 2018-10-25 20:24:21 Most folks I know in Quebec and Ontario don’t have real energy literacy to know where oil/gas comes from.

More knowledgeable on electricity (hydro, gas, nukes, wind) due to proximity of news and facilities
1710 2018-10-25 20:23:56 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!

1713 2018-10-25 20:23:20 Somewhere I’ve got John Titmans ELF Oil second half race jacket that I bought in the original Alan Wilkinson benefit auction and I’m flummoxed as to where it is but it was 40 years ago.
1714 2018-10-25 20:23:11 Who sells CBD oil? I need to connect with you. I have someone dear to me that I think can benefit. Thanks!
1715 2018-10-25 20:23:02 Lol. I know a ma. That owns a firm. When buhari entered. He was hit with all the tax he evaded. Glad to tell you he had packed up. So many of them. Even the so called oil companies most are stealing Nigeria resources. You should know all these
1716 2018-10-25 20:22:52 As soon as you got elected, we were packing our bags at work.  Your party has created record debt, increase of suicides, increase in divorces, increase in cost of living, chased away investors and wrecked our oil & gas industry.  If you truly love Alberta, please step down.

1721 2018-10-25 20:22:23 Oil production has risen sharply in Alberta in the last two years, and is the highest it has ever been.
1722 2018-10-25 20:22:20 Good. #VoteRed2018 #MAGA #redwave 
The real question is, why aren't you down by more?

1725 2018-10-25 20:22:01 Laughable? It might be brilliant from Justin’s perspective; crash a few trains, pollute environment, then react by shutting down Canada’s oil and gas business in its entirety. Problem solved.
1726 2018-10-25 20:22:01 Mayonnaise is made with hydrogenated oils. And soy bean oil. Soy beans are 90% gmos in this country.  Gmos gluten AND Roundup. 7up is made with gmos, roundup
1727 2018-10-25 20:21:59 Good for you! Every little bit helps! I implement many of these strategies but didn't realize toothpaste tabs were a thing...I'm going to look into this! It pains me that regular tubes can't even be recycled. Alternatively, I do DIY toothpaste with coconut oil & baking soda.
1728 2018-10-25 20:21:50 @HeidiHeitkamp's opponent in North Dakota is Kevin Cramer. He supports tariffs that cripple ND farmers & ND's oil industry, opposes regulations to protect ND farmers from impending climate change doom, & supports a GOP plan to gut Social Security & Medicare for ND retirees.
1729 2018-10-25 20:21:42 Can't stop laughing at "I eat oil paintings when security guards aren't watching".

1732 2018-10-25 20:21:32 Not everyone, just a very small percentage who are snake oil salesmen with a disproportionate amount of power.
1733 2018-10-25 20:21:12 I found some great stuff in the Charity shops in #Weston-super-mare; a Brass Indian teapot on stand with oil burner!

1737 2018-10-25 20:20:45 I think the mining costs of bitcoin both financially and ecologically is its Achilles heel, it’s like swapping oil mining for electricity mining, it’s a brilliant concept but it has been improved upon and ultimately it will be superseded

1739 2018-10-25 20:20:40 @RealDanQuayle Jay Rockefeller sending a gentleman by the name of Percy here...  he has to turn over everything to me!  The Hilton’s!  All of them!  Jim Justice, the clines, and natural gas owners too!  All coal, oil, natural gas...  farmers, vineyards, sugar cane horses but,
1740 2018-10-25 20:20:39 Thanks. It’s a model market for EVs in many ways: as you say not necessarily one that can be replicated, but one from which we can learn.  I think infrastructure also an important part of it - probably an infrastructure funded from oil wealth!
1741 2018-10-25 20:20:34 Maduro - your people are starving and you have hyperinflation though you are an oil rich nation 

Probably should focus on that...

Just sayin
1742 2018-10-25 20:20:29 I never care for it. Just give me green bean stir fry with garlic and oil!

1746 2018-10-25 20:19:48 Ah yes, all those people on Russia pacified by the benefits of incredible oil wealth.

Hang on one second.

Ok I've just made a call and it turns out people in Russia are actually too miserable to move and mostly drinking themselves to death.

1748 2018-10-25 20:19:44 I think everyone just wants all the negative stuff to stop towards both #ukog and #angs we are all in this together regardless if you are in 1 or both shares!! As I have said before all we can all hope is that at some points major buys both companies out!!
1749 2018-10-25 20:19:41 It is to laugh. On another topic, if the series goes back to Boston, I nominate Bill Spaceman Lee to sing the national anthem. Or maybe Oil Can Boyd.

1755 2018-10-25 20:18:30 About a month before he #died, my poor old  #Dad had his back covered in oil. After that, he went down hill fast.
1756 2018-10-25 20:18:18 "Our society" was LIED to by GOP leadership. There was no Al-Qaeda connection with secular Sadam. There were no WMDs. We weren't "bringing freedom."

All LIES meant to provide GOP donors with control over oil & gas supply. Surely you understand that.
1757 2018-10-25 20:18:17 Maybe he should try dressing like it was a political rally instead of like he was about to change the oil in the El Camino.
1758 2018-10-25 20:18:16 Though, pro tip, it tastes richer if you use olive oil.
1759 2018-10-25 20:18:11 The oil thing works because Google siphons it up, refines it, and sells it as gasoline to 3rd parties Our "compensation" is a free app whose primary purpose is to siphon our data.

1762 2018-10-25 20:17:56 Congressman toasts to diversity by mixing Sesame oil and chayote
1763 2018-10-25 20:17:54 Right. But we could just as easily have the oil refined in the states. We have existing pipelines with them. It's a much larger ecological impact when you're shipping oil halfway across the world. Not to mention supporting a regime like the Saudis
1764 2018-10-25 20:17:53 As long as our gubment has put agendah 21 in place to get us sick,we have to strike back with healthy diet,exercise & organic essentials to counter that.cop your CBD oil now,website coming soon.
1765 2018-10-25 20:17:49 Can’t stop, I got olive oil on me 
1766 2018-10-25 20:17:41 Hey, @realDonaldTrump, they have oil in the UK. We should go annex them.
1767 2018-10-25 20:17:36 Change my oil then  please

1770 2018-10-25 20:17:19 Energy East is an export pipeline and our govt doesn't buy oil. Private industry does.

1773 2018-10-25 20:17:18 Oil produces gasoline, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas (such as propane), distillates (diesel and jet fuels) and "residuals" that include industrial and electricity fuels. ... Conventional steam - Oil is burned to heat water to create steam to generate electricity.
1774 2018-10-25 20:17:18 No. Connecticut doesn’t have to worry about any of those things. They and all of us need to worry about climate zealot snake oil salesmen like you.
1775 2018-10-25 20:17:10 Oil !!!?
1776 2018-10-25 20:17:02 The story you linked to mentions nothing at all about #climatechange, or #ActOnClimate or #climate.

This is devastating to the #environment for sure, but its due to #pollution from an oil spill, after two cargo ships collided in the Mediterranean, near Corsica.
1777 2018-10-25 20:16:55 I'm getting my oil changed and some punk ass kid changed the channel from Jurassic Park to some Hallmark channel bull- fucking -shit because they "don't believe in dinosaurs." I'm about to throw a 15 year old into a goddamn volcano.
1778 2018-10-25 20:16:55 Pretty good! It's easy to use. I got my brother one for Christmas. You don't have to use any oil. Maybe spray the pan with some, but I haven't had any problems with it
1779 2018-10-25 20:16:48 Oregon Citizens want energy independence. We want Our State to allow offshore oil & gas drilling. We want Our Clean Coal Plants operational.

1781 2018-10-25 20:16:46 Exactly. That’s why it’s so important to get this wrapped up quickly, find out if it was some dudes on Discord, a loner, a political group, an external group (a psyop with props) ... anyway, I’m sure the FBI will be burning the midnight oil on this one
1782 2018-10-25 20:16:26 I don't buy oil. In fact only one private refinery in Canada buys Saudi oil. The Irving refinery. Go ask them why they choose Saudi oil over Nfld oil.

1785 2018-10-25 20:16:09 ooh yeah they do. you can just buy generic oil though, the fancy stuff just has added Other Oils for wood preservation
1786 2018-10-25 20:16:00 For all his complaints about oil money, he behaves like a Sheikh.   But at least Mansour's putting up his own (ill-gotten) money.   Uli's doing it on the club's dime.
1787 2018-10-25 20:15:57 I didn’t think you’d try olive oil that quick
1788 2018-10-25 20:15:57 Arrggg, coming from a racist in power that is seeing his days coming down to jail uhhhh I’m pretty sure that other countries can take care of themselves. Hint hint it’s not like we’re invading your other countries for oil or anything
1789 2018-10-25 20:15:56 There are provinces with a PST and a balanced budget(BC).
It will help but the main reason for one is to be able get close to balance without the need for resource royalties.

It would currently take an 8% PST to balance. I advocate for 5% with budget cuts and save all oil rev.
1790 2018-10-25 20:15:54 Sorry to interrupt Wanderspain but can I just ask...do you ever give up your time to take photos ? It is all well and good you questioning and criticising  but I was just wondering if you have ever taken a photo or a video ?
1791 2018-10-25 20:15:54 Peppermint Oil. Add a few drops to some camomile tea with honey!
1792 2018-10-25 20:15:50 In hindsight should have spent a yr in Europe and another in AHL. Just not ready.  Nothing to do with Oil.  Not like Matthews or Laine were developed.  They were just ready,
1793 2018-10-25 20:15:45 Different issue. If you want to talk oil taxes, fee and dividend is the best system. 
The above is about income taxes, and could easily be passed by referendum, if allowed.
1794 2018-10-25 20:15:43 Of course .... and to be fair I asked for Calamari Frito ...but I didn’t expect the whole feckin thing...and they had used old oil to fry in. Sinful .
1795 2018-10-25 20:15:40 Being an equestrian is having no issue whipping out checks for shows/tack/vet/farrier but feeling personally victimized by the cost of an oil change.
1796 2018-10-25 20:15:15 The IPO didn’t happen for the 1st time even, the rising price of oil means there is no rush

1801 2018-10-25 20:14:45 Room tidied, bed made & essential oil diffuser on  I’m ready to sleep! 
1802 2018-10-25 20:14:17 I'm 48 and get occasional breakouts and I believe it's hormones as I never do anything different. But over cleansing your skin may add to the problem as you're washing away the natural oils which tells the sebaceous glands they need to produce more oil. Hope it settles down soon
1803 2018-10-25 20:14:10  Those gorgeous little leathers panyans would have been just right for a pint bottle of 2 stroke oil too! 
1804 2018-10-25 20:14:03 Dudes never heard of combing their beards and beard oil. Looking like you got pubic hair on ya jaw smh
1805 2018-10-25 20:13:59 Back in energy east time they said they purchase 1/3 of their oil from AB, 1/3 from US and the rest from Saudi (and wouldn’t buy more if they had a pipeline unless there was an economic case for it)
1806 2018-10-25 20:13:31 What essential oil will make my cat stop waking me up at 6 am?
1807 2018-10-25 20:13:21 The ultimate grifter, con man, snake oil salesman, scumbag, Trump is now blaming the media for the mail bombs when his own hateful words are the reason the bombs were sent. Impeach this fucking Nazi piece of shit before he gets someone killed with his hateful, manipulative BS.

1809 2018-10-25 20:13:12 . @montesolberg asks the journalists to comment on @jkenney war-room idea to defend the oil sector against its critics.

1815 2018-10-25 20:12:16 ~ try not to use a lot of oil on your face
~ don't be harsh. Using too many products with chemicals can be hard on your skin, especially if it's sensitive. Try using more natural products on your skin. And make sure that they are fragrance free.
1816 2018-10-25 20:12:07 Why do we buy their oil ? What are those people in Windsor going to do for work ?
1817 2018-10-25 20:12:04 @truebotanicals I ordered samples of Hydrating 
Cleanser and Hydrating Oil as well as the Renew Hydrating Cleanser and Pure Radiance Oil. They came in an envelope and hubby thought it was empty and threw it away...I want to cry

1819 2018-10-25 20:11:58 You mean Canadian oil jobs? Just say it Andrew. What, has oil become a 'dirty word'?
1820 2018-10-25 20:11:53 Sanctions needed on US business in Cameroon as soon as possible , naval blockade to stop delivery of oil to others , seizing of all financial resources of Biya's tyrannical regime should be priority .

1824 2018-10-25 20:11:33 Keep building houses that doesn't create wealth, later you will queue for bailout; when u have oil and capacity to secure refinery license!
1825 2018-10-25 20:11:11 Omg tan, coconut oil better than western chemical for your hair.... Omg I need a new lifestyle show with Tan and Hasan, I cannot stop laughing and agreeing with the realness of this conversation.
1826 2018-10-25 20:11:07 Here we go again. What if the Saudis suspended oil shipments ?  $4 a litre ?  All those people at the plant are unemployed ? You're a dipshit with no cards to play.
1827 2018-10-25 20:11:00 I'm really not an expert. I actually first bought coconut oil to cook with thinking it was flavoured with coconut, later to find out it was doing the rounds due to it being a " healthier super food" & it's higher cooking temperature. Just amazed at the earlier programme really.
1828 2018-10-25 20:10:59 I swear you go to firestone for a damn oil change and mother fuckers be like “you also need a new air vent, all brand new tires, a paint job, engine, oh yeah and a new car” like bitccchhhhhhh
1829 2018-10-25 20:10:56 Gotta get that oil money like the big boys
1830 2018-10-25 20:10:21 I put them in the pan with a bit of oil, roast them a bit, then I add the juice and water and cook them in the pan until they are ready

1833 2018-10-25 20:10:14 at the mechanic getting an oil change watching @KUWTK bc the owners daughter works the counter and i've never felt more welcome in such a masc environment #KUWTK
1834 2018-10-25 20:10:13 Interestingly initial US producers, saddled with high start-up debt, couldn't cope with low oil price & for bankruptcy. New owners taking over assets have little accrued debt so overheads fell sharply, extraction now more profitable at much lower oil prices.
1835 2018-10-25 20:10:04 Maybe, let's try this little experiment, oil goes to like $10/b and we see whether we would be able to keep off another romance with recession.

1839 2018-10-25 20:09:55 … and “BIG data” is the new snake oil.
1840 2018-10-25 20:09:52 Every Tahoe owner ever: "It's brand new I shouldn't have to add oil."
1841 2018-10-25 20:09:49 Strictly speaking, in my case, we used unconsecrated olive oil stolen from the college salad bar...a fact that my friends invoke whenever they want to explain deficiencies in my Christian discipleship!
1842 2018-10-25 20:09:40 Go to get my oil change and apparently everything needs to be replaced. Unfortunately my mom only gave me money to get my oil changed so please pray that my car doesn’t blow up on the drive home this weekend 
1843 2018-10-25 20:09:31 From oil to boil.
1844 2018-10-25 20:09:24 War is just? Oh, was your freedom interrupted in 1992 and/or 2003? Was our country being threatened? We're we on the brink of WWIII? 

No. But those GOP politicians sure wanted to keep those Big Oil donors to keep writing donation checks.

War is just, my foot. Trillions, wasted.
1845 2018-10-25 20:09:10 Regardless what you cant eat.. Make sure u oil ur hair and grow it upto waist length.. That would hence ur appearance..
1846 2018-10-25 20:09:05 The last people I'd ask to root out lies are these 4 politicians, who are funded by the oil & gas industry. Their plan to fight tax breaks for environmental groups is worse than a lie, it's an attempt to suppress democratic opposition to totally unregulated oil & gas exploration.
1847 2018-10-25 20:08:59 sis needs an oil change
1848 2018-10-25 20:08:46 Lovely! 
1849 2018-10-25 20:08:41 Conservatives drove us off the road as they couldnt balance books on $100 oil. NDP put dynamite under the vehicle.
1850 2018-10-25 20:08:26 Women get a car and don’t check the oil, tire pressure, coolant, they check nothing, they just wake up and drive that mf 
1851 2018-10-25 20:08:07 Finally getting an oil change...I should be ashamed of myself...
1852 2018-10-25 20:08:07 I'm never once planning to go on holiday around those oil peddlers
1853 2018-10-25 20:07:58 And she rubbing it in like it’s an essential oil 
1854 2018-10-25 20:07:54 I always said oil packaging is the biggest waste there is
1855 2018-10-25 20:07:46 Oil prices don’t work that way sir..can u pay 300 per litter?
1856 2018-10-25 20:07:45 My advice would be: Attend a conference of a professional association in a field that interests him/her, be it oil and gas or construction, pharmaceuticals, etc.
1857 2018-10-25 20:07:39 oil pumps
1858 2018-10-25 20:07:38 I check my oil ... bitch
1859 2018-10-25 20:07:33 Russel, was the advice from MBIE and treasury driven by oil company confusion?
1860 2018-10-25 20:07:32 and oil rigs and strip mines are so pretty?.. I really don't get that argument at all. "It's cheap, clean, energy but i don't like how it looks so let's keep using the polluting stuff" ..
1861 2018-10-25 20:07:21 Don’t know how I feel about the saviors of the world being oil drillers tho....
1862 2018-10-25 20:07:14  not really our colors. But have no choice then to make it work @PipoDerani @AX_Racing looking forward to cheering you on in 2019!
1863 2018-10-25 20:06:57 Because Venezuela is not a paradise is a hell and they know that, they want to live with money from somebody or some country  else this is the real socialist, parasite, look Cuba they feeding from Venezuela take our oil, turkey our gold, and Venezuelan dying
1864 2018-10-25 20:06:46 Operation Feed the Nation OFN turned Obasanjo Farm Nigeria OFN...
Those oil wells, how did they get them, when and how much?
Let's call those who sold Nigeria to themselves "Father of Business" and Buhari who chose the right path "mumu with 150 cows"
1865 2018-10-25 20:06:39 Oh, so it's a unity thing, uh Chelsea?  As unifying as oil and water.

1870 2018-10-25 20:06:08 If you realise that the storm is gradually getting over. The price of crude oil is gradually increasing which is a good indication. So they can reduce the price now.
1871 2018-10-25 20:06:05 Being an oil baron in the industrial revolution sounds lit af 
1872 2018-10-25 20:06:04 Wow is that baby oil

1874 2018-10-25 20:06:03 Good on ya!!! But please don't give that company any of your hard-earned money for their nasty roasted in fish oil swill. There are plenty of other places that serve better coffee than that.

1875 2018-10-25 20:05:59 Actually, I understand it. It is the quintessential example of an "alternative fact," an alternative truth. Scarmucci's statement is a contradiction in the real world, but in Trump world intentional lies are not lies but the "methodology of mistruth," snake oil salesmen peddle.
1876 2018-10-25 20:05:54 Are we not sure about making a decision until we've seen all the evidence, again. 
Oh! Sorry, that's only a bad thing if it's the Labour Party weighing up the evidence. It's a good thing when it's a oil rich, bomb buying, London property owner.
1877 2018-10-25 20:05:54 Go Oil.
1878 2018-10-25 20:05:52 Sharing it online is also disgusting
1879 2018-10-25 20:05:51 While on that topic: Years ago when I was doing Auto service we always called Chevy Tahoe "Chevy Two-Strokes" the fuel management stuff made then drink oil so bad you'd do better to fill the fuel tank with it. So many of them didn't have any left in the crankcase to drain.
1880 2018-10-25 20:05:32 Canada is right behind Saudi’s @ #3 in proven oil reserves. We’re neighbours, polite and we can even show you how to run an affordable healthcare system for everyone. Yet your President mocks our PM while making nice to murder bone saw prince. What up with that?
1881 2018-10-25 20:05:30 The two of you will be very happy together. You are both hucksters shilling your wares to an uneducated public.
A generation ago you would have been selling snake oil.

1882 2018-10-25 20:05:27 Sorry - Not buying the snake oil. Please STOP the lies and division of our beautiful country.
1883 2018-10-25 20:04:45 Solar & wind are way to go & lobbyists for gas & oil are holding R Gov hostage. China is moving ahead of US while US scientists are finding ways to take carbon dioxide out of air & reuse it
1884 2018-10-25 20:04:35 pshhhhh mine is 78 now for the synthetic oil in my new car sooooo annoying
1885 2018-10-25 20:04:31 Take bits & pieces. (What herbs, what candle, what oil, what crystals.) never follow one spell & do what you're comfortable doing. What to ask for make it realistic.

1891 2018-10-25 20:03:58 Daal of any type. My favourite at the moment is mung daal boiled with salt, finely chopped ginger and a dry red chilli. Drained like rice (dry but soft). Then caramelise onions in a ton of oil and pour the lot over the top. Pretty damn yummy. Traditional Pakistani recipe.
1892 2018-10-25 20:03:52 Is grapeseed oil okay if it's expeller pressed?
1893 2018-10-25 20:03:52 Gun oil
1894 2018-10-25 20:03:22 "It's basically just coconut oil and prayer" is the best line ever and Loreal needs to steal it.
1895 2018-10-25 20:03:18 "So you aren't gonna watch #CrownJewel but you're still gonna drive a car powered by Saudi Oil?"

Yes you stupid fuck, I'm gonna skip a wrestling show while also surviving in a system I didn't build.
1896 2018-10-25 20:03:13 I should seriously sell my hair growth oil ...
1897 2018-10-25 20:03:05 Hey idiot dude — I buy zero tar sands oil. The only ROI is in their cheap export cost as sludge shipped to 3rd world craphole countries for refinement. Electricity ALSO comes from hydro dams, nuclear, wind, and solar. The latter 2 are growth industries. NOT oil & gas. Dolt.
1898 2018-10-25 20:02:59 Can we try this little experiment for like a year, let the Niger-Delta keep money derived from its oil and let's see if Kano would have money for Ganduje to steal and stuff in his babanriga.
1899 2018-10-25 20:02:58 I have learned to roast them with a little olive oil and seasoning!  Quite tasty actually!
1900 2018-10-25 20:02:41 AB NDP Carbon plan- Current oilsands is 70 megatonennes per year by 2030 capping oil sands emissions to 100 megatonnes per year,   So no reduction there - saving the planet???
1901 2018-10-25 20:02:29 I just peeped a fineeeeeee ass dude @ duke of oil & buddy working there peeped me peeping dude  I always get caught
1902 2018-10-25 20:02:28 Umm, I'm not sure. Rising oil prices?

1906 2018-10-25 20:02:03 I vaped the whole dab but not the whole thing of oil. if I did that I would throw up until I died I think, instead my throat hurts a bit
1907 2018-10-25 20:02:01 yeah grill them with some red seedless grapes, a lil sugar, olive oil and pepper.. you'll like it..
1908 2018-10-25 20:02:00 If it's good for us when the oil stock goes down, why isn't it also good when the #stock market crashes?
1909 2018-10-25 20:01:58 Okay then this is a shit team. 
1910 2018-10-25 20:01:55 Bringing unemployment down 4.5%- 3.7% wow 0.8%. Obama took Bush's 10% and brought it down to 4.5% thats MAGA.  On meds why didn't he tweet examples of the"pouring in" price drops.  He's a snake oil salesman/conman. And they always get followers no matter what. Lie after lie.

1913 2018-10-25 20:01:44 I’m sorry but the oil spill is definitely a move that shit was too live last year 
1914 2018-10-25 20:01:38 That's one sexy oil tanker. Nice job on the repairs.
1915 2018-10-25 20:01:27 And yet, anything more effective than carbon pricing is off the table? Why so much twitter resistance, rationalization, and ignoring of the simple idea to simply put an oil company out of business? Is it because everything else is business as usual?

1918 2018-10-25 20:01:18 Now considering oil, the observable results of climate change can be anticipated. Rising sea levels and more frequent and intense storms will impact coastal oil terminals and oil rigs, for example.

1922 2018-10-25 20:00:57 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently they had the publisher of the National Enquirer on their board, they have a stated mandate to support the oil companies at all costs and want American style conservatism to rule Canada. It is propaganda, not news.

1924 2018-10-25 20:00:40 @jengerson: "you can't build a moral case for Canada's oil sands industry if you're going to abdicate the moral responsibility to act on climate change."
1925 2018-10-25 20:00:36 China even stopped buying American oil.
1926 2018-10-25 20:00:32 You are a horrible person! Ever heard the saying if you can’t say anything nice don’t say it at all!? I bet your  just a real oil painting! Funny how she’s been with Ant for years and years and she was good enough for him then!! #shutthef**kup

1947 2018-10-25 19:58:42 . @jengerson what is conservatives carbon plan? Can you sell the oil sands without one?
1948 2018-10-25 19:58:39 One time I snorted a eucalyptus concentrate oil (by accident) (was trying to sniff) while driving and almost died.
1949 2018-10-25 19:58:27 It’s like the gallons of oil the US goes through for air conditioning
1950 2018-10-25 19:58:22 That’s totally fine & honestly, sounds amazing together!! I just think it’s so strange when you essentially put 2 different types of pasta on the same dish?? I didn’t ask for an entrée sampler? Lil salt, pepper, oil, & parm cheese would’ve done the trick  That’s just me tho...
1951 2018-10-25 19:58:17 All is well, engineer hasn't long left.  It was oil and totally harmless (except for the lovely mess it left in the cupboard).  Something to do with it having been an exceptionally hot summer .
1952 2018-10-25 19:58:08 Sorry Cameron those have always been my biggest complaint that's somewhere during high school kid should be taught about finances and drive is at should actually teach them how to change a tire check the oil besides being safe and driving properly
1953 2018-10-25 19:57:46 Now a day, no news on oil prices and rupees..now it is no more matter, because it is reducing...

Gvt agrees to pay civil servants hard cash in USD
After being given an ultimatum by the soldiers the gvt has finally agreed to pay all civil servants in hardcash of USD. To get jokes like these sms cooking oil to  51654 @RMajongwe @ShingiMunyeza @GutuObert
1957 2018-10-25 19:57:30 If you massage the kale and use olive oil it will slide easily into the trash.
1958 2018-10-25 19:57:29 It does make some assumptions, like oil prices remaining high and a continuing success in exploration. It's a good asset to have but you need to be careful about placing all your independence hopes on it as North Sea oil has been on a slow decline since '99.
1959 2018-10-25 19:57:24 Hey gang! Drop by @PearlDiverTO for a delightful dinner and check out some of my new Billboard Oil Paintings. So fresh, I don’t have photos yet! #art #toronto #oysterbar

1964 2018-10-25 19:56:31 You are not wholly wrong OPEC tried to put the frackers out of business by dumping cheap oil on the markets but cost of shale extraction has hugely dropped , private equity knows that shale will outlast typical oil extraction plus you ignore geo politics USA likes independence
1965 2018-10-25 19:56:31 be warned: 20+ hours in, I haven't seen anything about beard oil
1966 2018-10-25 19:56:05 Agree 100%.  Now start producing CANADIAN Oil and using our resources to fund OUR Country and stop re-buying from everyone else.
1967 2018-10-25 19:55:45 We can strike a balance here. We have tremendous oil revenue in the ground. We need that money desperately. We do have solar & wind farms here. They are expensive to build. We need $$ to build more. US needs independence from foreign oil. We need to diversify our revenue.

1969 2018-10-25 19:55:15 I drive a biodiesel truck that runs off recycled vegetable oil. I literally pollute less than a regular combustion engine in transport.
1970 2018-10-25 19:55:08 Went to Beamish for the day, ran me car battery down by leaving the headlights on. The AA man who came to jumpstart it talked quite emotionally about how much he loves Beamish, the engines, the smell of grease and oil. He has an annual family pass.

1982 2018-10-25 19:53:29 My boots are covered in jet fuel and hydraulic oil, I had to walk up about 100 steel stairs...I don’t need to say anymore
1983 2018-10-25 19:53:23 That’s exactly what I found. A lot of the funding has been traced back to Koch brothers, who incidentally own much of the oil sands rights. 

Some of this money is funneled through right wing think tanks who can obscure foreign funds.

We also have our own gun lobby. Similar to
1984 2018-10-25 19:53:15 Hate getting oil changes

1988 2018-10-25 19:53:09 The assumption (which is obviously Wrong), is that politicians like Ruto, are Brain workers; who burn the midnight oil, thinking about creating jobs for fellow citizens. But our politicians are Not Brain workers; & they spend their evenings in clandes' embrace; or night meetings!

1999 2018-10-25 19:51:34 even Yaradua gave SLS free hand to jack some of these guys. he traveled abroad when they were picked up. they couldn't believe it. Buhari is either spineless, or a fraud. anyway we should demand for our money since govt will not help us. let us start with those oil workers!

2003 2018-10-25 19:50:53 @fortunechasi I understand we lost hundreds of soldiers & millions of $ protecting the Beira-Feruka pipeline. When war ended in Moza why was the pipeline closed. We were getting fuel cheap cause it was coming as crude oil b4 processing @ Feruka What's the position with the Feruka

2005 2018-10-25 19:50:52 Hears the history of Gavaskar, and see that this illegitimate father of yours has long been working on leaving the field. Sleep with your own charcoal oil.
2006 2018-10-25 19:50:42 CBD is an amazing thing. I have been taking it for just over a year and my life is so much better now. I cannot see why YouTube would do this over CBD and if they did, that's just pathetic. I can go into my pet store and get pet dosages and formulations of CBD in oil and treats.

2013 2018-10-25 19:49:20 Seriously? Young. It damaged by religious inculcation are free, selling snake oil so over
2014 2018-10-25 19:49:13 Killing Gaddafi was just to stop that plan . He already called a conference of all the oil producing African countries and had already started producing the currency
2015 2018-10-25 19:49:11 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
2016 2018-10-25 19:49:08 The level of pollution in the world today is becoming intolerable. 
Only the other day I opened a can of sardines to find it was full of oil and all the fish were dead.
2017 2018-10-25 19:48:54 The US+allies non stop attacks against Venezuela is because it has the LARGEST OIL RESERVE IN THE WORLD. Everyone decent, with a working brain, that does not eat up the garbage from the media 7x24x365xALWAYS knows it. Do you? I guess not. Go ahead and do some real work pal.
2018 2018-10-25 19:48:23  Gaddafi was on the verge on releasing gold currency which would mainly be African currency and the only value accepted in exchange for oil. This would have changed the economic balance of the whole Africa. If you have done your research, you would have known this
2019 2018-10-25 19:48:10 You will hate me, I bought an electric car from money I made buying and selling oil futures. And I think your wrong, its the demand that needs to be addressed not oil workers. A bit like passing on an undertaker because your gran died. 
2020 2018-10-25 19:47:50 I need that bless me with some money oil. Lol
2021 2018-10-25 19:47:48 Yall i smell like coconut oil and lemons. Its so nice despite the fact the i look like i rolled out of bed in sweats and my hair put into like. The lowest ponytail bc i just. Do jot care today
2022 2018-10-25 19:47:35 I can’t imagine a world without olive oil.
2023 2018-10-25 19:47:34 Useless team. Ffs How did you be there? Is this champions of Greece? Bullshit.
2024 2018-10-25 19:47:18 Oil_
2025 2018-10-25 19:47:14 That's so annoying. Without cbd oil my seizures would be out of control. And the side effects would make me all but bed ridden and I'd never eat. Also thanks Charles got the Lamictal tip. My doctor did actually put me on it.
2026 2018-10-25 19:47:06 Hold on...are you insinuating I'm no oil painting either haha
2027 2018-10-25 19:47:03 Which rights exactly?  Look to be honest... politicians and snake oil salesmen are all useless members of society.... i have a homestead and mainly rely on actual things like bartering, trading skills etc...  the less money in the pockets of any gvt is better!!!
2028 2018-10-25 19:47:03 Them @AndrewScheer and the rest of the blowhards in Ottawa should get to work on changing this. We have oil that can be move east or west, time to stop supporting the regime in Saudi Arabia
2029 2018-10-25 19:46:44 There are certain medications that have a ceiling. In other words, taking more than 2 aspirins wouldn't really help.

Does the same hold true with #cannabis? Can you have kief, thc distillate, rosin, honey oil plus of course #pot? Would that just be a waste or would it work?
2030 2018-10-25 19:46:31 What about linseed oil? Thks
2031 2018-10-25 19:46:30 @atiku keep d dejected oil city alive & economically viable. Dis is our plea Sir.

2033 2018-10-25 19:46:10 Bath bombs some are peppermint, some are lavender, some sweet orange. They all have coconut oil which leaves you feeling so soft! 
 My kitchen smells awesome! LOL
2034 2018-10-25 19:46:00 BJP asking for donations is like Saudi Arabia asking for oil, hum garibo ko kyo sharminda kar rahe ho?
2035 2018-10-25 19:45:59 Irving oil, is based in New Brunswick, the Irving oil refinery in New Brunswick, has no access to Alberta oil and never did.  So yup, bullshit talking point.
2036 2018-10-25 19:45:54 I call bs here. A cow is a lot of work. Been around them all my life and dont know anyone that does this.
2037 2018-10-25 19:45:39 I had good results with kitchen oil
2038 2018-10-25 19:45:27 Hi Kendra! Would you be willing to chat about your experience with CBD oil for a story I'm writing on women with Lyme and their use of these products? Feel free to DM if so, thanks!
2039 2018-10-25 19:45:24 FWIW - as the world pulls away from oil, the Saudis will shift gears to Solar power. There will be a shift in society that mirrors it, so I think modernization of Saudi mindsets will occur concurrently.
2040 2018-10-25 19:45:22 Make sure y'all oil is changed in your car if you have one and if you don't oil up the chains on them bikes
2041 2018-10-25 19:45:19 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2042 2018-10-25 19:45:15 Yep. He's a narcissistic attention hog who will use anyone he can to advance himself. Once he started talking about running in 2020 (on July 4, IIRC), most people started to figure out what a snake oil salesman he is.

2045 2018-10-25 19:45:08 . @jengerson compares opposition to the oil sands with opposition to seal hunt.
2046 2018-10-25 19:44:59 I regularly use rosehip oil, take CareOf vitamins, and I’m about to order a satin pillowcase. I feel like perhaps @boomama and @BigMama might have a little too much influence in my life 
2047 2018-10-25 19:44:56 He’s absolutely right. Only reason he was killed is cos he wouldn’t trade his oil for American dollars. Only traded in gold and America didn’t have any
2048 2018-10-25 19:44:55 what number did you get on the Oil?
2049 2018-10-25 19:44:43 Which is why the oil companies are still exploiting us :)
2050 2018-10-25 19:44:42 When you have a mini break down in your car after getting your oil changed cause you had to pay for something else you weren’t expecting and you’re realizing you’re a real adult and you’re feeling overwhelmed. 
2051 2018-10-25 19:44:41 Have you looked at Rockrose Energy? Once the tender for 20% of the equity is completed I believe the stock will sharply rerate. #RRE I compiled a screen today of circa 30 producing oil stocks ev/p1&p2 this is comfortably the cheapest helped given cash pile so high !! See earlier
2052 2018-10-25 19:44:37 I happen to have some cannabis oil handy!
2053 2018-10-25 19:44:36 Y’all BO smells like peanut oil

2057 2018-10-25 19:44:06 FOLLOWED ALONG WITH A BOB ROSS PAINTING BUT I COULD ONLY FIND MY OIL PASTELS INSTEAD OF PAINT SO I HAD TO SUFFER THROUGH IT BUT BOB ROSS MAGIC MADE MY "PAINTING" OKAY LOOKING REGARDLESS.
2058 2018-10-25 19:43:59 Funny that he finds all sorts of carrots to dole out immediately before an election & then his dementia sets in, like his election promises, he'll forgets them immediately after the midterms. ARE AMERICANS REALLY THAT STUPID TO BELIEVE THIS VILE SNAKE OIL SALESMAN?
2059 2018-10-25 19:43:52 コカ。
2060 2018-10-25 19:43:41 . @jengerson goes after the ethical oil argument (which has been a real theme of the conference). Asks the audience, how well has that argument been going for you?
2061 2018-10-25 19:43:37 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently they had the publisher of the National Enquirer on their board, they have a stated mandate to support the oil companies at all costs and want American style conservatism to rule Canada. It is propaganda, not news.
2062 2018-10-25 19:43:36 yaaaa   but how did you protect US citizens money from the last massacre on the market?  and why is US still importing oil from Saudi Arabia  ,   especially after the murder of the Washington Post journalist?
2063 2018-10-25 19:43:27 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently they had the publisher of the National Enquirer on their board, they have a stated mandate to support the oil companies at all costs and want American style conservatism to rule Canada. It is propaganda, not news.

2065 2018-10-25 19:43:08 I hate to hear that! My dad was a part owner of an oil storage tank farm near Helena. We never moved there, but he considered Montana to be close to (a very cold) paradise. He especially admired the spirit of Montanans.
2066 2018-10-25 19:42:55 @jengerson: "How's that ethical oil argument working out for ya'll? Is it changing anyone's mind?"
2067 2018-10-25 19:42:42 5.  Remember that this is a refiner that just bought 3 ethanol plants.  In this sense they are hedged on E15 and loss of gasoline market share.  This time I agree with a refiner's position.  See all you oil patch folks, I do have a mind of my own.

2069 2018-10-25 19:42:23  they need to be cooked in fresh olive oil straight from the trees 
2070 2018-10-25 19:42:17 Almost time for my baby to get an oil change
2071 2018-10-25 19:42:15 They just drink pure oil probably
2072 2018-10-25 19:42:06 Let's not buy their oil.  Butts made this decision with eyes on the election.  Don't kid urself they care about journalist.  If they do, we would go after turkey and others as well.
2073 2018-10-25 19:42:06 Also only takes 10 mins if you grate the cheese and crush garlic and warm the oil while pasta is cooking so plenty of time to repair to the sofa to feel sorry for yourself.
2074 2018-10-25 19:42:01 Sautéed in garlic and olive oil, yum. Damn, now I’m hungry.

They work pretty well for fries, but it's weird when you realize how much you miss the taste of oil/grease in your food.

2080 2018-10-25 19:41:24 How about building the energy east pipeline so we can stop buying $10 billion a year of Saudi oil @JustinTrudeau ?
2081 2018-10-25 19:41:18 We don't get much. Our imports from Saudi is at 1988 levels. We produce 65% of our own crude oil. 949 barrels out of 10,144 barrels per day. Oregon coast will not make up the difference. New energy will.

2085 2018-10-25 19:40:13 Okay it’s kind of like a cup of oil

2087 2018-10-25 19:39:49 Rosa, you worry too much lil-boy. Philippine oil tax hike suspended, and rice ratification obviously will bring inflation to 4%... Life were too short to enjoy deep sleep & gain extra height... #Trililing
2088 2018-10-25 19:39:46 People who DON'T pop pimples are the gross ones. You have oil, dirt, and puss fornicating all over your face and you're just gonna let them get away with that
2089 2018-10-25 19:39:32 And I'm allergic to skunk oil. Our dog got skunked a long time ago and came running back into the house and coated a whole bunch of stuff... And I ended up in the emergency room! To say I'm not a fan of this particular species is an understatement!

2091 2018-10-25 19:39:13 I wasn't aware that you could make an essential oil out of an inorganic mineral. (Where's that face palm emoji??)
2092 2018-10-25 19:39:11 need me a sweetboy who’s gonna oil my scalp, give me cuddles and watch movies with me.
2093 2018-10-25 19:39:07 Garlic spaghetti. Cook spaghetti to al dente then warm oil in frying pan with plenty of crushed garlic. Add spaghetti and swish round to coat. Serve with grated cheese to warm your heart. Garlic will help healing...
2094 2018-10-25 19:39:05 1. Yes me and mine are NOT better off because of him. The price of EVERYTHING has gone up! Every time a GOP gets into office we stop producing oil by a lot and our gas rises outrageously. His tax cut put pennies into our bank account gop has made our healthcare worse and more
2095 2018-10-25 19:38:58 Need me someone to draw an oil art of this pix
2096 2018-10-25 19:38:32 Lmao omg I just overdose on melatonin all the time but I REALLY need to use CBD oil
2097 2018-10-25 19:38:16 Stop pushing new oil pipelines and start investing heavily in shifting our economy to renewable energy. Trudeau is doing neither of these.

The idea that carbon taxes + pushing every pipeline imaginable is "the best" plan is really stupid.

The finance minister @HKRotich for 8% VAT on fuel products immediately when we had our own crude oil in Turkana
2100 2018-10-25 19:38:03 you know what you are talking about!!! Yes, our Honda was certified used, so glad we did that. Saved lots of money and have had ZERO issues in 5 years with that car ... only gas, tires, wiper blades & oil changes 
2101 2018-10-25 19:37:58 I don't care for Kale, but I do love Mustard Greens with green onions, bacon bits and then hot bacon oil spooned on lightly.
2102 2018-10-25 19:37:54 昨日の下げは 初めてでビックリでしたΣ(O_Oil!)
2103 2018-10-25 19:37:51 I hit my oil/lotion combo today but I walked outside for 20 mins and your girl is currently ashyyyyyyyy! Needed to bring out the butters 
2104 2018-10-25 19:37:48 Me too. I hate being on the same side as the oil companies but I have no interest in trying to solve this problem on the backs of poor people
2105 2018-10-25 19:37:45 riiiiffff a ese oil 
2106 2018-10-25 19:37:43 Always Lavender oil
2107 2018-10-25 19:37:25 Keep peppermint oil on me.  Ever know when you need a little refresher.
2108 2018-10-25 19:37:18 A lot of discussion on how AB has lost the PR campaign against oil sands, not a lot of reflection on why it was and continues to be successful. A Joe Oliver / Ethical Oil / rapid response truth telling squad approach has been shown not to be effective. What's next.
2109 2018-10-25 19:37:18 I love this! I found an essential oil diffuser-type necklace on Amazon for 7.99. I love it! I look like a freak smelling my necklace all the time hehe. I'm like hey you got your sharpies, I got my oils. Haha
2110 2018-10-25 19:37:05 He had a whole story of how he had a bad reaction to some oil in his coffee and he was shittin blood lmao “I built my own house, I have a good job, I don’t do drugs” 
2111 2018-10-25 19:36:53 There are so many alternatives. But you know what doesn’t work? Focusing on a negative PR campaign instead of any viable alternative. Moe might as well lead the Oil Party.
2112 2018-10-25 19:36:53 Coconut oil and olive oil love!  three times a week is solid or every time you get out the shower apply a dime size through the ends And lots of trust, envisioning the growth, and patience my dear

2114 2018-10-25 19:36:40 Second step is nutrition; this plays a vital part in becoming fit. You cannot put substandard oil in a high performance car; it needs to be high quality. Likewise for a quality temple, healthy food and a balanced diet is key. #ChatWithBodyPraise
2115 2018-10-25 19:36:31 Probably because we sell more than the others put together? Or just because we love Saudi oil? 
2116 2018-10-25 19:36:26 They were so excited to color these trick or treat bags that Plant Therapy sent in our last oil order! #pthalloweenbag
2117 2018-10-25 19:36:23 Friendly reminder: It’s finally a little cold in the morning so let your cars warm up for a couple of minutes before you start driving. Gotta let that oil circulate and lubricate all the engine internals 
2118 2018-10-25 19:36:22 I never claimed to be an expert in oil markets. And I’m an ecologist, not a climate scientist. I can, however, understand that predictions made by the models, what their uncertainties and sensitivities, and what the predictions mean for the future (including oil). Can you?
2119 2018-10-25 19:36:14 Atleast now village will be kinda empty. Parents will tell their kids to wait in fuel lines or in line for cooking oil so they won’t have time for Village

2123 2018-10-25 19:35:58 In the last 20 years Americans have destroyed/burned over 20 million acres of rainforest in SE Asia to replace them with palm oil plantations killing thousands of animals and creating billions of tons of carbon pollution. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

2127 2018-10-25 19:35:34 @TheBarbieBlank  please tell your mom I said hey!! Still changing oil on beach Blvd!!!
2128 2018-10-25 19:35:29 Tea tree oil yeah? Alright thanks 
2129 2018-10-25 19:35:09 are you applying oil?
2130 2018-10-25 19:35:08 I understand we need the revenue & the new way of getting it out of the ground. I don't approve of fracking! Apparently we've been fracking safely all along but if we open up the resources to extract the natural gas & oil we'll become as another Oklahoma, earth wakes & all!
2131 2018-10-25 19:34:54 Wow. No more foreign investment in oil and gas. Unreal.
2132 2018-10-25 19:34:51 LOVE OIL
2133 2018-10-25 19:34:43 Coconut oil on hair but NOT ON THE ROOTS please .. no one likes greasy hair 
2134 2018-10-25 19:34:39 Yes, and something I discuss in my Oil Fall series is the mistaken model that China will adopt ICE vehicles in the 21st C to the same degree the West did in the 20th C. Moreover, China still very much an electricity nation. EV arriving long, long before oil could gain position.
2135 2018-10-25 19:34:38 @Amazon @Twitter @Google @facebook are monopolies who control what you see, hear, read on the internet. They have a political agenda and they are using power against conservatives. They have far more power than ATT or Standrard Oil ever dreamed of.

2138 2018-10-25 19:34:31 @SuitsAndBootsCA Keep up the great work providing Canadians with factual information about the Oil & Gas Industry and helping to counter well-funded foreign interest group campaigns willing to sacrifice Canadian jobs and clean energy.

2140 2018-10-25 19:34:23 Where can I get tea tree oil?
2141 2018-10-25 19:34:16 Why?
2142 2018-10-25 19:34:13 Can Scheer do any better?
He recently went to India, met many leaders.. he was heard boasting how Canadian Oil can plug the gaps in huge Energy requirements of India
2143 2018-10-25 19:34:10 I’m not so angry about that as I am to make a decision affecting the entire country just to impact two cities. 

Yrs ago our drunk finance minister abruptly ended oil trust stocks because he was worried about 5 million in “tax leakage” from some Americans who owned the stocks
2144 2018-10-25 19:34:02 I’ve been trying to tell people #Saudi is nothing but liars and the #khashoggi situation just confirms it. This is what happens when tyrants are allowed to have billions in oil.

2148 2018-10-25 19:33:54 Trudeau shouts down dissent and elbows his way in legislature. This isnot respectful behaviour. He is dictator determined to get his way and expand tarsands no matter how people in the lower Mainland feel. He doesn`t respect marine ecology or whales. Socialize housing not oil.XOX

Go figure..
2154 2018-10-25 19:33:38 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.

2156 2018-10-25 19:33:27 Upon re-reading the story, I take your point. But to say the Star produces objective journalism is laughable. They are blatantly pro Trudeau, pro climate change hysteria, anti CPC and anti oil and gas industry. As a westerner, I feel completely persecuted by our federal gov.
2157 2018-10-25 19:33:26 strikes me as more power/fame grabbing snake oil salesman bullshit.  Look we all hate trump, and no I dont know anything about you your problems or care about how to fix them but here is the deal make me POTUS to get rid of Trump cause I can win - and we worry about you later K ?
2158 2018-10-25 19:33:25 Norway relies on its petroleum sector, oil price increases acct for growth after a drop in 2014. Subprime collapse in 2007 caused problems across the EU. Some recovered better than others.
2159 2018-10-25 19:33:25 See I couldn’t do that, my hair is waaay too coarse for that. I need all the oil and moisture I can get.
2160 2018-10-25 19:33:24 Stew don finish, use palm oil.
2161 2018-10-25 19:33:13 I feel for you when you don't like certain foods and you have to decide how to handle it when you're eating at someone's house. There are very few things I absolutely can't eat. I do have to ask about artificial sweeteners and canola oil.

2169 2018-10-25 19:31:24 I love how people with no sleep issues think that going to bed and falling asleep are the same thing. Those who @ me with lavender oil and sleep hygiene suggestions will be blocked.
2170 2018-10-25 19:31:20 The most logical statement I ever heard was, "Remember to live your life." (Speedee oil change in Dallas) I replied, 'What if I have more than one life?' - Apollo
2171 2018-10-25 19:31:15 @freefanaddict how do you deal with your fibromyalgia? I have recently begun CBD oil and it is remarkably effective! ... I'm also on Hydromorphone, which doesn't hurt, but got off Fentanyl.

2175 2018-10-25 19:30:17 No Royal. They are tribal savages. Oil does not get you royalty nor money class as we in case of @realDonaldTrump
2176 2018-10-25 19:30:15 Scaramucci is a snake oil salesman.
2177 2018-10-25 19:30:15 Wow! I never thought carbon prices could work, because they are not supply-side. But now I’m convinced they will do a lot of good. Perhaps their biggest boon is keeping climate change prominent in voters’ minds. Then it will be easier to elect someone to end an oil company.
2178 2018-10-25 19:30:13 Not again please. Is it jobs, oil, carbon tax? State your grievances so we can talk intelligently.
2179 2018-10-25 19:30:08 I use to do this too and stopped. All I mostly use now is water, oil and conditioner (hello hydration) because I've no time for all these different products saying they'll make my curls pop n tbh I hate wearing my hair out! Too much knots!!
2180 2018-10-25 19:30:02 Listen here they maybe able to dress like you put their hair like yours and even copy your messages!! But rest  assured that your Anointing (OIL) can’t be Copied or imitated!!

2182 2018-10-25 19:29:42 What was the price of crude oil when  he left and what's the price of crude oil right now?  At time people like you like to disregard facts and just tweet for sake of tweeting
2183 2018-10-25 19:29:37 It is the disruption of Middle East Oil wells capped from war damage puts a strain on the Global dependence of Crude oil...US/Israel will offer to sell oil from Golan Heights to help oil demands...All planned out. World is being taken a for a ride...
2184 2018-10-25 19:29:37 It’s the price of keeping the lights on as the oil runs dry , while we get renewables and nuclear properly into gear , fracking is a minimal risk just let GM crops , don’t stand in the way of progress move to Blackpool and take a slice of the profits instead

2186 2018-10-25 19:29:14 Venezuela gets sanctions yet is attacking no other countries and beheading no one while the Saudis have no respect for human rights yet get zero sanctions. Keep the oil flowing do what you ever you like.
2187 2018-10-25 19:29:06 The Koch Brothers have never met an environmental proposal that they didn't hate.  

But what else would you expect from a fortune built on building the oil industry for both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.
2188 2018-10-25 19:29:05 The big lie is ‘+4% plus GDP’, which is practically par with ‘17 Q2 GDP at 3%, after  you back out the one-time, ‘sugar high’, fluff from the (1) tax package, and, (2) tariff-beating explosions of oil, steel, aluminum, soybean, and, corn exports.
2189 2018-10-25 19:28:59 Hi Jean,
Thanks!
I ended up getting a full spectrum 15% organic oil from the lovely people @cbdoilireland & am finding it good so far.
2190 2018-10-25 19:28:36 Biz!  I currently recruit engineers for an international oil & gas company. It is difficult to not talk to people on the plane. I am a gabby, & I usually want to know about people and what they do. Great for contacts.
2191 2018-10-25 19:28:02 idk bUt the actual thought of snake oil being from an actual snake is-

2201 2018-10-25 19:27:18 Hi Chris you demand a more scientific approach on the oxygen problem. As long as we keep filling our system with water we can’t totally eliminate this problem. In ‘94 my degree thesis was how can we use different liquids in our heating systems mineral oil for example
2202 2018-10-25 19:27:08 I heard there was a lot of drilling going on out there. I presumed it was for oil. Guess I was wrong.
2203 2018-10-25 19:26:58 This morning, I had a classic example of are you glowing? Or is there too much oil on your face?
2204 2018-10-25 19:26:54 Studies show that eating plant proteins can improve our health, and lower our mortality rates. In fact, consuming plant oil is also healthier than animal oil. But are animal proteins such as whey proteins more or less easily digested than plant proteins such as pea proteins?
2205 2018-10-25 19:26:53 Get in touch with us for oil change services, AC repairs, and more.

2207 2018-10-25 19:26:52 ...and next to it a machine that makes hydrogen out of the water using solar power... and a car and home heating system that runs on hydrogen... Tada!

2217 2018-10-25 19:25:49 Apples are created through the sun's energy the same way oil is created. And essientially how Bitcoin is created since all of Earth's energy is derived from the sun.
2218 2018-10-25 19:25:38 Don't let that stop you, Trust Fund Kid!  You've destroyed the oil and mining sector with C69.  That will cost us billions too.
2219 2018-10-25 19:25:31 I always check my oil, buttttt the tire pressure is another story.
2220 2018-10-25 19:25:30 Yes great day - system had me get out of miners on the 19th , stand aside and wait. Figured earnings on the 24th were catalyst.   Oil and Gas turning .

2223 2018-10-25 19:25:00 Norway is 99% hydroelectric, old viable tech but dependant on running water, Germany is 45% coal, 30% nuclear and 25% ‘green’ (oddly they are building coal plants and securing oil contracts due to brownouts from unreliable power source, guess which one) and costa rica is warm.
2224 2018-10-25 19:25:00 Today in class I learned oil doesn’t mix with water and that soap makes bubbles..... this is a quality education that I am paying for Ohio state thank you for taking my money

2229 2018-10-25 19:24:34 Also....they got 5 minute oil changes on every corner now lmao. I ain't getting on nobody's ground for that lmao.

2233 2018-10-25 19:24:18 USA politics did that because over oil wich we dote need oil, we need free energy that do exist
2234 2018-10-25 19:24:07 I would agree to a point - with our gov race if we place a third party candidate which holds the people and environment as the top priority- we have a chance to change the system- that gov elects the heads of DEP- first time a non- oil and gas person would head the DEP in PA
2235 2018-10-25 19:23:59 Sure u would be stoned. .big deal watch movies tv shows sleep alot .you can work out some if your up to it ..when your in this state the oil stops the flow of food for the cancer cells the cancer dies. done yes that simple ask tommy chong he cured himself hes looking great at 80
2236 2018-10-25 19:23:52 Just described something I'm working on with @SQLRockstar as "having to do with Sherlock Holmes. And oil. And possibly cheese". 

I cannot stop giggling. @jennebarbour is significantly less amused.
2237 2018-10-25 19:23:37 Mr. Browder, we're working hard to pull America back from the Oil Oligarchy grasp, but we must prepare ourselves for setbacks: GOP in my state of Georgia are pulling out every dirty trick they know. Whatever comes, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING THESE GOP TRAITORS.
2238 2018-10-25 19:23:36 Lmfao I have to go buy baby oil, then I’m back to shooting
2239 2018-10-25 19:23:33 I don’t mind at all. I once heard that they are all black, but turn green when ripe ?  I’ll heed your advice and not try one from the tree.  . I visited a Greek olive grove and seen hundreds of olive trees, they only grow them for oil though. A fascinating experience. 
2240 2018-10-25 19:23:19 He and Harper didn't do a great job with oil and gas opponents when they were feds; in fact they probably did more to exacerbate the division (and thereby make pipelines more controversial) than anything...

2243 2018-10-25 19:22:54 Tilapia is so much better than grilled chicken for protein loading. Nearly identical macros, but also has the additional omega fish oil, cooks more consistently, and much easier to get down than grilled chicken.
2244 2018-10-25 19:22:51 Oil, metal flakes, and fucking gas, machine shop gave me this shit in highschool.
2245 2018-10-25 19:22:50 And whoever governs this technology owes me for the Sulphur 8 shampoo and Tea Tree oil for the scalp irritation due to brainmapping...
2246 2018-10-25 19:22:23 3-3-1 to start with this schedule is good IMO. Since the first two games the Oil have looked engaged and are often outplaying the best teams in the league. Definitely a few bugs to work out but I am happy with what I have seen so far. I'm sure we have the hardest October schedule
2247 2018-10-25 19:22:08 scheduled my own oil change and i’m on time yeah i’m an adult 
2248 2018-10-25 19:22:04 Noble Corp Elected Murphy Oil's CEO Jenkins to Board
2249 2018-10-25 19:21:50 Yes. Capping oil demand growth for China at least begins the process of halting further dependency, and, re-weighting towards domestic energy. It should be said: all domains that boost wind and solar supply and then electrify transport are choosing this re-weighting.

2254 2018-10-25 19:21:30 Imagine all that used oil from our ex-japs getting disposed of in this remarkable way,,,this is a green venture worth exploring
2255 2018-10-25 19:21:18 Refresh us on your statements of Obama using IRS to attack conservatives. Of Obama shutting down coal, oil and manufacturing jobs which are the livelihood  of many middle class Americans?
2256 2018-10-25 19:21:07 This is what they are going to use weapons bought from US with dirty oil money. how very ethical. #US #SaudiArabia
2257 2018-10-25 19:21:03 This guy. But seriously, I thought Midnight Oil was pretty woke.

2259 2018-10-25 19:20:56 @AndrewScheer says (the oil and gas industry) is facing an unprecedented ideological challenge from federal and provincial governments. Wants more @CanadaAction type work.
2260 2018-10-25 19:20:53 Fact: I would trade at least 1 UFA signed D on the Oil for Demers in a heartbeat
2261 2018-10-25 19:20:38 Exactly. 24 years of the White House is endless Die For Oil war and pointless disastrous interventions and destabilization. The Democrats and Republicans are endless war parties. Stop bombing and stop SELLING ARMS TO SAUDI ARABIA and people will not be fleeing by the millions.
2262 2018-10-25 19:20:35 Girl I got some at target and it’s PAWPPIN. I’m about to go back and get the glow toner too. I’ve also been doing an oil cleanse before my regular face wash and added a vitamin C essence to my morning routine
2263 2018-10-25 19:20:33 Lavender essential oil works every time on those babies who don’t want to nap . Rub a couple of drops on ya arm & pop a boob/bottle in their mouth. Yep.

2268 2018-10-25 19:20:04 Maybe not Carl   I have a situation with  my child that requires government or social programs.  Id love to see the oil get to market and then taxed and used for those with disabilities and other needs.  I just don't trust the left at all.  The right notmuch better predictable
2269 2018-10-25 19:20:02 I went out to buy new windshield wipers, some oil for my car & I was gonna go to gamestop to buy some PS3 games. I ended up buying a Starbucks cup that I'm gonna bedazzle & got my eyebrows ruined.
2270 2018-10-25 19:20:02 Facials. Oil & washing it.
2271 2018-10-25 19:19:53 Agree. but US is supporting wahhabies. Using them to depopulatizing the ME. Sothat reaching oil.
2272 2018-10-25 19:19:43 . @AndrewScheer compares protests in BC opposing oil projects, but notes that there are not protests in St. Lawrence river upset about foreign oil (and their human rights records).

2281 2018-10-25 19:18:57 This day in history, Oct. 25, 1967:  The Port of Suez in Egypt was shelled by the Israelis. An oil refinery, supplying most of Egypt's own fuel needs, was destroyed.
2282 2018-10-25 19:18:51 VW Golf R MK7 Haldex pump, unfortunately at 27k miles it was too late for this pump as the build up in the filter had totally blocked the oil way causing complete failure, resulting in no rear drive! 
If your 4wd VAG car is struggling for traction this could be why!
2283 2018-10-25 19:18:51 Saudis need to retool themselves for the new non-oil-based economy. Can’t slight them for that. They need business partners. If the black-elite loose control of the optics and narrative we might just find ourselves in a better world. All the dogs are chasing the rabbit.
2284 2018-10-25 19:18:37 Eric forgot a D&D rule, so I'm going to bring the shame collar to PAX Unplugged and we will chant the Gygaxian mantra while showering him with peppermint oil and flax seed. The way the founders intended.

2286 2018-10-25 19:18:35 You want access to my educational system, the jobs provided by my infrastructure and my banks. SA has oil, The US has water, food, good banks, a functional legal system and ... oil. You need us more than we need you. So quit killing our journalists or learn to drink oil.

2302 2018-10-25 19:16:32 Oil & Gas are doing a fine job of that on their own.

2315 2018-10-25 19:15:06 There was already a “war room” to talk about the REAL challenges on oil, no just its critics. It was when the majority of oil business leaders endorsed the NDP carbon strategy. Doesn’t Mr. Kenney get tired of chasing ambulances? #abpoli #AbLeg #Cdnpoli #cdnmedia
2316 2018-10-25 19:15:05 Dude, focus. You were talking about oil and gas prices. I provided data. You got triggered and went off on several different directions.
2317 2018-10-25 19:15:01 Yeah, good advice, except I am IgG positive to hemp. that includes both cannabis and manilla hemp. To prove a point, I smeared a tablet of procana cbd oil on my arm to show the hives.
2318 2018-10-25 19:14:58 I don't know about you (I don't actually know your gender tbh and hence hair fuss level!) but when I was young it was all about JoJoba oli. Remember that? Now it's Argan oil. As far as I can see it just adds to the price, and makes my hair limp...
2319 2018-10-25 19:14:57 Text book is better.

2326 2018-10-25 19:13:25 @JustinTrudeau If we are 6th in oil production, and 9th in carbon production, why should we have a carbon tax that seems to have only slowed economic growth? Shouldn’t Economic Growth only be compared to other oil producing countries, as other GDP growth is impacted by it?

2330 2018-10-25 19:13:15 100% renewable grid completely possible. Light and heat easy. Want oil for plastic and coking coal for steel. That's all. Gas or diesel dispatchable power useful  during transition but only until enough pumped hydro and other storage built.
2331 2018-10-25 19:13:15 I like kale.  And spinach. I like basically anything green sauteed with soy sauce and/or bacon or sesame oil (don't do both, as it's too much).
2332 2018-10-25 19:13:05 . @AndrewScheer argues that the Trudeau govt wants to phase out the oil sector. See carbon tax, tanker ban, bill C-69, etc.
2333 2018-10-25 19:12:59 Why should we pay penalties for broken contracts - they don't care what we think and will just order from somewhere else.  Only thing we could do that they might care about is stop buying Saudi oil
2334 2018-10-25 19:12:58 I always thought Zoroaster was the original oil baron. Well, original fugitive hydrocarbon baron at least.
2335 2018-10-25 19:12:48 Let's hope Maksimov, Benson and McLeod can have a similar impact on the Oil. With McDavid and Draisaitl leading the charge, this team should be ready for a deep playoff run in 2019-20.

2344 2018-10-25 19:11:47 Trying to practice taking more deep breaths during the day. Also CBD oil is great for anxiety
2345 2018-10-25 19:11:44 Hope they changed the oil and plugs as well as the air filter.
2346 2018-10-25 19:11:42 Espérons que le CEA penche sérieusement sur les réacteurs à sels fondus en lieu et place d'astrid
2347 2018-10-25 19:11:42 . @AndrewScheer like @jkenney @DeronBilous that Alberta uses oil wealth to build schools and hospitals, not promoting tyranny and terrorism (ie., KSA, Iran).
2348 2018-10-25 19:11:39 Al chupa cabra , sierra oil , Gerald y cuñados y AFORES?.
2349 2018-10-25 19:11:30 Get government out of the way? Do you mean stop all subsidies to the oil and gas sector? I'm all for that if that's what 'get out of the way' means.
2350 2018-10-25 19:11:22 I really couldn't wrap my head around the oil. I still can't find anything on it, the people that live there told me. Then my daughter came home and said that oil was reported in Spring Creek. That's all I have. I will take the boat there soon.

2357 2018-10-25 19:10:39 Agree that animal agriculture is most definitely a huge contributer. I was just expressing that allowing more methane from another source...(oil & gas) unnecessarily, will only exacerbate the problem.
2358 2018-10-25 19:10:36 Producing ricin requires a lot more than "grinding the beans"!  Castor oil is made by pressing the seeds from the bean and it's not toxic!!!
2359 2018-10-25 19:10:33 簡単だっぺ
2360 2018-10-25 19:10:23 You have no choice, no moral scruples do you, but to throw oil on the already raging flames of hatred that you have planted and nurtured.  (BTW: The so called ‘ fake news’ you decry is vastly more real than you yourself personally will ever be
2361 2018-10-25 19:10:21 Venezuela has already dropped the US dollar & embracing hina's Banking... I imagine Venezuela oil contracts with US will be affected.  China's Economy is very thirsting for oil... Price per Barrel of Oil will continue to rise as predicted. $100 per barrel by end of 2018.  Hi-gas.

2364 2018-10-25 19:10:08 That's why #Saudi rulers stopped pocketing and depositing oil money  in the west.  They will return all their personal $billions to the government and give power to the public

2366 2018-10-25 19:09:46 Now @AndrewScheer taking the stage, opens up with his recent trip to India, saying Canada is missing out on valuable markets by not getting oil to tidewater #EnergyRelaunch #ableg
2367 2018-10-25 19:09:45 Some fairly strong evidence to support the prediction. Totally agree on the British Elite though, they sell their souls for oil dollars. The Qatari’s own more land in London than TFL. 

I just considerthe source.
2368 2018-10-25 19:09:45 Ecology professors are experts ... in something. Probably not trading crude oil futures...
2369 2018-10-25 19:09:43 Maybe you should do something so Oregonians can actually use less oil.

Instead you allow the TriMet board to be a do-nothing shrill for Big Rail and developers, use Metro to gentrify and push lower income citizens out, and waste money on Amtrak trains that end up wrecked.
2370 2018-10-25 19:09:42 A1: Critical infrastructure powers our day-to-day lives. It's the electric grid, power plant, oil field - and even the ballot box. Without these, our lives change pretty drastically! #ChatSTC #CyberAware
2371 2018-10-25 19:09:37 Fair enough if you choose to ignore the other factors. Which you are.  Exxon sells oil, correct?  Will see how this unfolds, stay tuned!
2372 2018-10-25 19:09:17 Bet they tax me for an oil change 
2373 2018-10-25 19:09:07 Wonderful outcome of #KSA visit by P.M @ImranKhanPTI magnificent effort by by F.M @SMQureshiPTI #pakistan being a larger consumer market can attract international investment in fields of agriculture oil refineries & textile sectors just needs an extra mile to walk for prosperity
2374 2018-10-25 19:09:01 How about cancelling the 80,000 barrels of oil eastern Canada buys from Saudi Arabia every day instead (or as well)? Is that on the table? Will anyone dare ask?
2375 2018-10-25 19:08:58 No, they use Twitter to dramatize everything. We don't need Arab oil. We have a ton of surplus oil in America. It's all politics. Trump is making personal gain from the Middle East. Saudis need us a lot more than we need them. They know it.
2376 2018-10-25 19:08:53 Fried as in spending my day at the beach and getting a bad sunburn, especially when using baby oil & iodine as tanning oil.
Combine oil + burn, get fry
2377 2018-10-25 19:08:39  the neutrogena grapefruit SCRUB, witch hazel, and the Nivea jojoba oil and vitamin e face cream. A mask at least 2 times a week and genetics. Lol 
2378 2018-10-25 19:08:36 Most of our airline’s gateways have maintenance crews - and spare wheel sets. Tires are consumables, just like oil, hydraulic fluid, wiper blades, etc. Gotta have them.

It’s also common for airlines to help each other out when needed (loaning parts, tools, hangar space, etc)
2379 2018-10-25 19:08:28 Oil is a scam.  It is and always has been ethanol

Saudi’s send East 11’/. of their oil. USA built 17000 kms of Pipeline last year & still building we built 0

2388 2018-10-25 19:07:35 Lmfao, you are manufacturers of terrorists and their hideplace. The statistics don't lie. Iran doesn't even make the top 20 richest countries. What are you talking about. Go sell your carpets. In the meanwhile Saudi Arabia has 90% of the oil market. Talk now.
2389 2018-10-25 19:07:24 THIS cat steals OIL MONEY
2390 2018-10-25 19:07:17 Hottest take: Grapping fries right out of the oil.
2391 2018-10-25 19:06:44 Pretty sure I got upcharged getting my oil change today because I’m a woman but ONE DAY I WILL TELL THEM I KNOW WHAT A REASONABLE PRICE IS
2392 2018-10-25 19:06:40 Use peppermint oil and water in a spray bottle. Non toxic and it works very well. Makes the home smell good too.
2393 2018-10-25 19:06:38 I think Benson is going to be a good NHL player, but it will always baffle me that the Oil didn't draft McDavid's former junior hockey linemate.
2394 2018-10-25 19:06:32 motor oil isnt for drinking
2395 2018-10-25 19:06:21 This is why I'm having problems considering voting for you when you ride on a largely symbolic gesture like this. There is likely no marketable oil or gas off the coastline. It's like saying "I proudly protected Oregon citizens from the ravages of Bigfoot predation." #orpol
2396 2018-10-25 19:06:21 Well they aren’t carrying barrels of oil, large duffel bags of cash or buying condos so...no, he won’t be tough on them!

2398 2018-10-25 19:06:12 i agree
2399 2018-10-25 19:06:06 God will continue to give your family beauty for ashes, oil of joy for mourning and a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. Amen
2400 2018-10-25 19:06:06 1% impact on funds from operations for many oil producers.  1%.  Obviously far too steep a price to pay in defense of our childrens planet. Playing politics with survival = scumbagerry.
2401 2018-10-25 19:06:04 Just a drop or two, you don’t need to rub it in if it’s too sore.

Properties were apparently found by a scientist who burnt himself during an experiment and who then plunged his hand into the nearest liquid, which, luckily, happened to be lavender oil, and not acid
2402 2018-10-25 19:05:58 If not for the press, the 2017 /Russian Big Oil Plan would have went fourth and Russia, Trump, Manafort, Flynn, Sessions,Tillerson, Gates, Would be 100 Billion dollars richer. No wonder Trump takes the Reporting Personal. I still wonder what was Congress getting out of the Deal??
2403 2018-10-25 19:05:51 because of fears of him taking control of his countries oil, which UK & USA had secured for themselves and fears of Iran seeking support from Udssr.

You wonder why some Iranians are angry with the USA & the world?
Look no further.

2431 2018-10-25 19:03:49 France is heavily dependant on agriculture and Germany on coal and steel.  The death knell for mining was the industrial action in Britain.   Coupled with cheap oil and gas.  We were played then just like Farage and his ilk are playing us now.

2444 2018-10-25 19:02:08 Neat lavender oil if you have any. Helps reduce burns etc. Only essential oil you can use neat. Or use diluted in water in a spray/misting bottle
2445 2018-10-25 19:02:03 If you pan fry kale in olive oil and garlic and put this on a pizza crust with onions, mushrooms, peppers, and fresh mozzarella cheese, you will like it almost as much as if the kale wasn't there
2446 2018-10-25 19:02:01 The hunger is real today! Just ate my snack earlier than anticipated cause I can not wait an hour and a half for lunch. Hopefully my tuna will hold me over. I added a spoon of coconut oil, in addition to the mayo, so maybe the extra fat will help 
2447 2018-10-25 19:01:55 And the Silver prize for Best New Anti-Ageing Product goes to @urbanveda for their Reviving Facial Oil. #PureBeautyAwards
2448 2018-10-25 19:01:54 First, what does that have to do with high local property taxes? More importantly, it depends what you’re measuring. If you look at oil and agriculture, red states dominate (with exception of CA agriculturally).
2449 2018-10-25 19:01:50 You are thinking Oil will go back to 65ish before higher?
2450 2018-10-25 19:01:19 I need them to have a show together

2454 2018-10-25 19:00:48 Talking with you is like trying to stick oil together with super glue. You clearly have no interest in #MAGA You're more than likely a liberal trying to show up the Republicans. There is no place for you in the future

2474 2018-10-25 18:58:09 I've had a number of art instructors in my lifetime. When I'm oil painting in particular, the voice inside my head is that of kansas artist Mary Binford Miller.  What does the voice say, you ask? Usually just "keep after it"!
2475 2018-10-25 18:58:08 Maybe he did it deliberately? Wore an #AppleWatch to broadcast gruesome event so West would recoil in horror. Maybe MIT helped him to get the pretext to seize Mecca and all the oil? To bring down the house of Saud?  Everybody dies but a single Jihadist can take down the Kingdom.

2478 2018-10-25 18:57:41 Yes, we did. AND furthermore they're pulling their damned tricks Mia and have released oil in our SPRING CREEK. I'm just heartbroken Sis. TY for your love and support.

2481 2018-10-25 18:57:28 Considering all the “bombs” sent to Dem only folk recently,isn’t it ironic the Dems in charge for the last decade plus “bombed” a lot of countries. Sometimes for oil,sometimes for displacing folk that didn’t agree with them. Oh and then there’s the URANIUM 1 issue. Them big bombs

2485 2018-10-25 18:57:23 That one said he would stop giving 'licenses' to individuals. The generals got angry and pretended it wasn't about oil. 
We shall here. 
2486 2018-10-25 18:57:21 My friends who let their naps/kinks be kinks and just wash, condition, and let it be what it wants don't spend much at all. B/c literally, shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer and/or oil. No twisting puddings, curling cremes, curl lengtheners, etc.
2487 2018-10-25 18:57:14 Welcome to the oil patch
2488 2018-10-25 18:57:13 "I'm not going to chance it, especially since I know how angry and vengeful you can get." It's like fire and oil with them when they're both angry. He rubbed the top of Ed's hand with his thumb, "I don't want to go down that route again."
2489 2018-10-25 18:57:08 Most of those have batteries
2490 2018-10-25 18:57:07 Probably. If it's running well and you've kept oil in it, that's typically the problem. I had a bad O2 sensor on my truck that threw codes all the time.
2491 2018-10-25 18:57:07 With all the brutal calls you have made on oil, there is a 0% chance I would buy.
2492 2018-10-25 18:57:02 If there is a large penalty clause - keep the contract, it means $ for us & stop buying Saudi oil.
They will only order from someone else - probably the states - why should we lose the money.  The only way to even make a ripple is to stop buying - they don't give a damn about us
2493 2018-10-25 18:57:00 When the cost of heating oil goes through the roof (because if litigation) will you support a tax "credit" that are stuck with oil? Nope us middle of the road Americans will be screwed again. Thank You....
2494 2018-10-25 18:56:54 My ex use to get facials at the barbershop and use some beard oil from Walmart. It’s smelled good always and was soft.

Do you really care about global warming? Don’t look for help from old-school “business as usual.”

2522 2018-10-25 18:53:23 OPEC's oil forecasts show that it expects supply growth to outpace demand growth in 2019. To keep prices around current to slightly lower levels once Iran fear premium is gone, OPEC forecasts imply the need to scale back output by ~800k bp/d from current levels
2523 2018-10-25 18:53:19 Gas futures lower?  Financial hacks are trying to explain it every which way.  FACT:  PEAK driving season HAS PASSED!  Winter looming ahead!!  Gas prices should be lower.

2528 2018-10-25 18:52:54 Very good question, I think that answer remains to be seen. Goalies develope later than other positions, maybe LB has figured something out in his game or it's just an initial new team spark type of thing. We'll see. Wouldn't be the first time Oil gave up on a goalie too early.

2560 2018-10-25 18:50:07 1/ Oil fields operated by the IOC’s have, without any investment, an average depletion rate of 8-10%. Hence their proved reserves/production ratios of the order of 10.
Oil fields in e.g., Saudi Arabia, producing way below potential, have a depletion rate of 1-2%.

2577 2018-10-25 18:47:24 Wonderful interview. First time I heard someone that is Stephen Quinn's equal in the pipeline debate. I agree we need to get that pipeline built and oil exported to Asia.

2599 2018-10-25 18:44:27 Ha, I just heard this in Dark Places. This guy swipes the oil off his nose and sticks it in her beer to deflate the foam... how thirsty are you now?
2600 2018-10-25 18:44:18 Spark plugs number one, check your oil too
2601 2018-10-25 18:44:00 Try to avoid washing your hair everyday. Constant shampooing leaves hair and skin dry and will increase oil production to overcompensate.

2608 2018-10-25 18:43:39 Cars, pharmaceutical and minerals (oil) are biggest UK exports. No wonder its car manufacturers and scientists that are kicking up. They are seeing their protectionist market broken up. If we leave, new opportunities will open up. EU is protectionist it paralyses the free market.
2609 2018-10-25 18:43:32 With new governments in both Ontario and Quebec,  can't understand why our Premier isn't in those provinces to see if Energy East can be kick started. Time to end importing Saudi oil and giving #potus a supply of cheap oil. If this fails, Churchill may be the last option.

2620 2018-10-25 18:41:52 All these texas Lady-Killers follow the same script: Good looking, poor white trash enters beauty pageant. Lonely texas oil man falls in love. Beauty queen goes through his money....

And then the murders begin
2621 2018-10-25 18:41:41 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
2622 2018-10-25 18:41:41 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

Hes come out and said a couple things but for the most part he done nothing but made empty threats while those people suffer. The caravan is following the law they seek asylum at the boarder which is the law

2637 2018-10-25 18:39:14 You could use some of that oil to fry eggs with it!
2638 2018-10-25 18:39:01 Bakwaas.
He has nothing to do with oil.
He is happy otherwise.
2639 2018-10-25 18:39:00 AGAIN...the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and 197 NATIONS and BIG OIL have studied climate change intently for 50 years. They are in agreement. 

Who are you listening to trying to tell you otherwise???  For something you supposedly "deeply researched" you have cite ZERO SOURCES.

2657 2018-10-25 18:37:15 While US loses public shareholder wealth, KSA loses real dollars which they can ill afford. If China decides to buy increased oil from Iran as reported today, they stick it to both Trump and KSA. China and India import is way more than US import of crude.
2658 2018-10-25 18:36:59 In Syria, Israel wants to grab Golan Heights for itself as there is oil there. ISIS/Al.Nusra help destabilize Syria ie benefit Israel.

2685 2018-10-25 18:34:15 @pizzaexpress #housedressing scandal. Fortunately checked the bottle before buying - now rapeseed oil not olive oil. Presumably you don't think this is an improvement #pizzaexpress ? No mention of NEW WORSE RECIPE on the bottle. I bought something else.

What do you think and why 
2692 2018-10-25 18:33:23 im very consistent with my inconsistency
2693 2018-10-25 18:33:15 because this whole "debate" which @APTNInFocus is so cleverly feeding into isn't about evidence or proof - it's about serving a political agenda and ensuring that the MNC, et al, continue to be INAC's and multinational corps (i.e. big oil) "go-to" for "Indigenous consultation"
2694 2018-10-25 18:33:07 They even cure cancer, those 2, super great for the immune system. Mix 10 drops in soupspoon coconut oil and rub on your neck and around your ears, smells good and heals

Well George Papadopoulos may very well have been targeted for nothing to do with Russia, with help from David Cameron and MI 6.

2704 2018-10-25 18:32:16 The raising of the intetest rates in U.S. and the correction in financial markets is pointing to a slower econ.Might put a damper on oil prices worldwide.
2705 2018-10-25 18:32:04 To be honest, I use coconut oil for everything,
1. It helps with removing dark marks by ur armpit area
2. After shaving apply coconut oil down there, works wonders...

But again what might work for some might not work for other... But goodluck

2710 2018-10-25 18:31:36 I've been saying the oil/data value analogy is bogus for a long time; to your point toxicity, the current global plastic waste issue is somewhat analogous to data. 'A single use item that hangs around forever'. I just wish the plastic problem was as easy to fix as the data one...

2716 2018-10-25 18:30:47 It wasn't a Canadian oil pipeline. And it wasn't stopped by Quebec. It was no longer economical. 

Free market. Love it or lose it.
2717 2018-10-25 18:30:30 A half-formed thought: I do think the oil co's need as much retribution as fits, and to be removed from influence on what is an existential problem for the civilization they, too, depend on. Past that, b/c climate is a cooperation problem, we need everyone to take responsibility.

2721 2018-10-25 18:29:56 Disappointing and disturbing @scotgov response so far, makes no sense to welcome more North Sea oil extraction to 2050 by which time IPCC says we must cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero - so a rapid change of course needs to start now.

Actually they were mostly black voters in Milwaukee and since they’ve been here since the time of slavery they were definitely born in the good oil’ USA.
2725 2018-10-25 18:29:32 Both sides... the press reports the facts. You have @POTUS that regularly advocates violence against anyone who disagrees with him. What kind of snake oil are you trying to sell.

2735 2018-10-25 18:28:56 Beyond climate change there are many environmental reasons to transition to #GreenEconomy instead of fossil fuel. For example, you’ve never heard of a solar spill (oil), a biomass earthquake (natural gas), or wind sludge (coal) because those problems don’t exist.

2748 2018-10-25 18:27:41 It is a primary responsibility as humans to evolve and expand horizons from historic times. Oil Money should not be the be all and end all of an economy in the 21st century.

2750 2018-10-25 18:27:40 If Quebec Govt can stop a Canadian Oil pipeline from the west it can stop Foreign Oil Tankers coming in the St Lawrence. 
That sort of denial is the root of the problem, 
In effect Quebec & Ontario are buying foreign oil by agreeing with and allowing importation of Foreign Oil.

2759 2018-10-25 18:26:27 I'm sure you are, I suspect Bilious will claim the NDP and Premier actually care about the oil Industry and will blame kenney for everything that has gone wrong for the last 3 1/2 years. Sure would appreciate some honesty and integrity from this government, just own who you are

2765 2018-10-25 18:25:50 The Green party's desire for more and more electric vehicles will increase the demand for electric power and will serve to widen the gap between power provided by renewables and that from fossil fuels, oil and gas.

Can't wait.
2769 2018-10-25 18:25:28 The real own of the land and the oil are dying of poverty and some one from the northern part of Nigeria own all this since 1990s, now I know.
2770 2018-10-25 18:25:21 3. To generate energy, you need fuel. Kid seems to be suggesting he uses used oil as fuel, but in that demo, the oil input (where he says the oil goes here after being cooled by the fan) is not even connected. That 3.7v battery is more than enough to power a small motor & LEDs
2771 2018-10-25 18:25:18 It is a theocracy and dictatorship. Whoring our values for arms sales, cheap oil and an anti-Iran stance is ok to Mr Mercer.

2779 2018-10-25 18:24:09 it was VERY complicated, you scrape some of the oil onto a metal rod, heat the front of a vape with an actual-ass blowtorch, then kind of feather the vape against the oil while inhaling and that’s how you do a dab

2790 2018-10-25 18:22:31 I never said you did. I asked if that's what you were implying. So what is your point exactly, because we are talking about an increase in wages not who's got the highest saleries? Oil and Gas (especially in AB) is struggling and probably hasn't had these increases.

2796 2018-10-25 18:21:38 That could just be because of the coat shedding. Keep an eye on it as you help the rest of the coat come out, but I'd guess it's nothing to worry about. Perhaps add some salmon oil (or something similar) to his food?

claimed that Oil price must have been determined by his wish
lending billions to bankrupt Europe

2822 2018-10-25 18:19:48 Did Cruz write this tweet, or did one of his donors? Also, oil is a dying energy. It keeps us relying on places like Saudi Arabia, so that when they murder American residents, we don’t condemn them so they don’t hurt our oil supply. Also, renewable energy is cheaper...
2823 2018-10-25 18:19:41 Just got an oil change, tire rotation, brake light replaced and cleaned my car. I feel like a new woman.
2824 2018-10-25 18:19:40 Once price is below landing cost, you clearly have a subsidy. When oil price fell to $30/$40, they actually reduced the fuel pump price. Maybe there was some over recovery at some point, but the exchange rate eventually eliminated that. Thanks for the engagement sir.
2825 2018-10-25 18:19:39 Here, we were made an experiment lab of failed conservative principles that didn’t work in Mississippi, Alabama, Wyoming, or all those shitty states with no oil!

2836 2018-10-25 18:18:44 In ND there were 30,000 unfilled jobs this summer---thanks to the oil boom, not Trump.  There are jobs, not just always where you want them to be.
2837 2018-10-25 18:18:44 Are you familiar with the tv/film industry and how much business we give away to Canada? Maybe the oil industry out there? California alone is sending Canada tons of money all the time.

2847 2018-10-25 18:17:26 I went to get an oil change and they're like "45min or so that ok?" I said sure and as soon as I sat down I realized I have had nothing to eat today and I'm gonna die
2848 2018-10-25 18:17:08 Good luck finding a lawn.  As a kid growing up in the late 50's, our family vacationed every summer in Casper (and Gillette), and all I remember when arriving there was the smell of oil wells.....

Asian equities remained under the pump, but Europe & US shook off negativity with a reasonable rebound - tech led the charge; commodities also saw upside, oil recovering by 1%; #NZD continued to be bogged down by #USD strength, though avoided a dip below 0.6500 - just.

2883 2018-10-25 18:13:25 Bad optics. But hammering home the fact under current law they must be let in and that electing more R's will lead to changes in law to stop the practice. Pretending wall is being built and real enforcement is a thing is not helpful to the cause
2884 2018-10-25 18:13:16 So notley stopped pipelines from being built and now wants to take away grain cars to put oil on rail..

2886 2018-10-25 18:13:13 Adam you're easily the best analyst on Twitter for Oil related signals.
2887 2018-10-25 18:13:06 .@jamieleecurtis talk with @Rosie about healing, I say try CBD with coconut oil and Kombucha to rebuild cells. Love you Mija, you are a hero and you chose these darkness to reveal light, thank you for being you.
2888 2018-10-25 18:12:58 Do we really need more oil Ted? How about more renewables?
2889 2018-10-25 18:12:55 No one worships ashy ankles and rough heels... be decent and go soak your feet at least. Lather with a good oil or shea butter and wear socks the entire day. Thank me later 
2890 2018-10-25 18:12:45 Sober: I’ll have a salad, no cheese, oil + vinegar on the side.
After 1 drink: I’ll have a fucking cheeseburger, large fries, side of cheese + extra cheese on the burger and fries, and a large pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and cheesy bread

2892 2018-10-25 18:12:39 Every big company has a website with a terrible search function that doesn’t work. Like you can go to Shell’s website and search “oil” and it’ll immediately be like “Oil? What the fuck is that? Sounds made up, asshole.”
2893 2018-10-25 18:12:34 No. Ontario and Quebec don't but oil either. 
Those private oil companies you want to invest in buy Saudi oil. You are the problem. Refineries in eastern Canada could buy oil from Nfld oil companies but they choose not to.

And yes I prefer "socialism" like Norways oil.
2894 2018-10-25 18:12:26 Have to sit at Lexus for 2 hours for an oil change instead of watching Arsenal 
2895 2018-10-25 18:12:17 Please don't blame the sensible ones among us for the crimes of bigots lie her, am glad you know her tweets are full of hate ,rage, nepotism etc, am glad you made your research, that was why her previous account was suspended.
2896 2018-10-25 18:12:08 Nah if it doesn’t do oil changes as well then there’s no point
2897 2018-10-25 18:12:06 Yeah, I get it.  Having a healthy smoothie for breakfast is a good way to start the day...greens, fresh berries, greek yogurt, flax seed oil. Except there's one problem, by mid morning I'm ready to eat my hand because I need FOOD.
2898 2018-10-25 18:12:01 Ma 1 ndooatinawo aya,so far Gvt is directly buyinC/oil,fuel,Bread for zimboz coz want 2 appear as if there is no inflation!my Qn is till when,since july 30 all my savings depleted by high cost of livin,,tosvikepi with no acces to health!!
2899 2018-10-25 18:11:58 I think if mengo is a hit, which it should be as oil was found there before but didn’t have the correct equipment to test, but obviously not a guarantee, then I feel the company will take some of the money to go ahead with the next drill but nowhere near the 5m
2900 2018-10-25 18:11:55 Oil vagu
2901 2018-10-25 18:11:51 First thing Cadre Montreal + @cadre_roony did was confiscate all our food until further notice and then distributed randomly after successful task .... if similar, which lucky participant would get your oil? Lol.
2902 2018-10-25 18:11:37 A safer means of travel might be having the oil companies transport these materials through new pipelines, that way people aren't put at risk and the environment doesn't play as big of a role  #UCBAMKTG2080
2903 2018-10-25 18:11:30 Now you’re just making things up. On your list are 2 of the 10 (#2 and #10 actually) largest oil exporters. What’s the purpose of the chart if I may ask?
2904 2018-10-25 18:11:20 $SPY oil joined the rally. This will be a hell of prop “scam job by America” dry out PUTS, year end reputation to keep this bloated 2 Months
2905 2018-10-25 18:11:13 His further proves that this govt is a fraud.if landing cost is 197 naira and they are subsidizing by 65 naira why are we buying fuel at 145. Oga?.we were even buying it at 145 when Oil price was 30 dollars why was it so oga
2906 2018-10-25 18:10:58 Za troskę?? jeździcie jak barany!!!
2907 2018-10-25 18:10:53 I had a shocking thought recently wearing my crystals, sipping my chamomile tea next to my oil diffuser/salt rock lamp... am I hippie Alice and just now realizing it? @madchenamick #riverdale 
2908 2018-10-25 18:10:47 Your first week as a developer is kind of like kinda knowing how to change the oil in a car, and then being handed a classic mustang to restore.
2909 2018-10-25 18:10:27 LoL you go find me job for another oil company?
2910 2018-10-25 18:10:27 My dad raised me as a man lol. I was a plumber, know how to change oil and tire, I know how to jump start a car and I know some tool names and car parts
2911 2018-10-25 18:10:20 …むにゃ…ぐぅ(エルザちゃんに寄りかかる
2912 2018-10-25 18:10:17 Or dumping oil smh
2913 2018-10-25 18:10:10 Is there any danger in transporting crude oil in the air? Why do you think ships are the preferred method utilized?
2914 2018-10-25 18:10:06 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
2915 2018-10-25 18:10:05 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
2916 2018-10-25 18:10:00 Can I ask will the lowering oil prices effect your strategy?
2917 2018-10-25 18:09:57 I just cancelled my oil change
2918 2018-10-25 18:09:53 That was obvious, the Saudis and Russians both want more money.... You know who else does? Those running the shale fields up north,  apparently the price was so low that it cost more to get the oil than they were selling it for.
2919 2018-10-25 18:09:52 all that type of talk is bullcrap. in guj he was controlling all officers nicely. in Delhi, lot of corrupt and bad officials are not afraid of him and he does not have full control of things.
2920 2018-10-25 18:09:44 yup, trivial amount. of course their oil supply is a lot more important in terms of daily economic operation, but we import 4 times as much from Canada
2921 2018-10-25 18:09:36 How does this square with your fossil fuel (it’s Scotland’s oil) obsession, your ministers going even five metres by car - and Sturgeon flying everywhere- and our antiquated public transport being relentlessly overheated ?
2922 2018-10-25 18:09:28 There are plenty of places you can purchase the oil. Try CBD Brothers, their oil is amazing and totally organic, and if you have FB, take a look on there also. 
2923 2018-10-25 18:09:18 You say Trump has done nothing?  How stupid are you? 
All the companies building factories, cut regulations, lowered taxes, turned us into an oil exporter, Germany is buying our Nat Gas, China is buying our Coal.  The best economic growth in history.  
Turn off CNN.  Brainwashed
2924 2018-10-25 18:09:18 The mans living like a Middle Eastern Prince who had found an oil well

2926 2018-10-25 18:08:43 As we learned last night: "The first major step is (literally) electrifying: if all energy sectors (including transportation, heating/cooling, industry, and agriculture) start running on electricity instead of gas and oil, a nation's overall energy usage goes down."
2927 2018-10-25 18:08:32 Have you tried CBD oil? I’ve not tried it, but have read lots of good things about it.
2928 2018-10-25 18:08:26 Is the crop being grown for the oil?
2929 2018-10-25 18:08:08 Please what are the maintenance structure put on ground to see to the smooth running Of this magnificent structure, couple with the fact that we have poor maintenance structure.
2930 2018-10-25 18:08:06 @ousocan pipe to @ Oil 'f Ol'
2931 2018-10-25 18:08:06 The $ we’d save by not buying Saudi oil would pay off that penalty quickly.... if only we had a pipeline that could replace the Saudi oil!
2932 2018-10-25 18:07:58 anything made from oil by chevron just went up in price.
2933 2018-10-25 18:07:49 @anthroatwayne pipe to @ Oil 'f Ol'
2934 2018-10-25 18:07:45 He was oil & gas industry,  not nuke
2935 2018-10-25 18:07:42 How can it be 0bama’s economy when Trump overturned ALL of his policies ??  Oil pipelines, Paris Accord, tax cuts, cutting regulations, has caused low unemployment, lower food stamps, lower Welfare payments, etc.
2936 2018-10-25 18:07:36 Where are the bloody benefactors, indeed!  Sure, universities take money from Big Oil and/or Big Pharma for science  research but who is supporting the beleaguered Arts departments?
2937 2018-10-25 18:07:33 I turned 25 and thought I had my life somewhat together until I got an email saying the remaining oil life on my car is  at 7%
2938 2018-10-25 18:07:30 How does that benefit us? Big oil is happy. You even want us to pay to protect their refineries from climate change that they’re causing to maximize profits. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #TXSen
2939 2018-10-25 18:07:19 CBD oil does not get you stoned bud. THC oil on the other hand, may prompt one to contemplate how hockey jerseys relate to Hollywood actors
2940 2018-10-25 18:07:11 all fun and games using baby oil to help scrub fake tan off but not so fun when ya nearly crack ur head open cos it makes the bath like a fuckin ICE RINK 
2941 2018-10-25 18:07:03 Cbd oil is my favorite @ddj12121985
2942 2018-10-25 18:07:03 Is there an emptying of processing/detention  centers in anticipation of the numbers on the way? Maybe a worthy story worth looking into.
2943 2018-10-25 18:06:53 He’s a snake oil salesmen
2944 2018-10-25 18:06:45 Is the oil pump improved because GTI engines have this problem oil pressure and it costs a lot of damn money to buy it , if so its welcomed.
2945 2018-10-25 18:06:44 the oil I did a dab of (so unfamiliar with terminology) last night was called Granddaddy Purp
2946 2018-10-25 18:06:40 a good indicator of #GHG emissions is how much we continue to throw money at unsustainable dirty oil & gas projects as opposed to renewables #tarsands #pipelines #tankers #stopkm #globalwarming #climatechange #parisagreement #fracking #fossilfuels #undrip #divest #fnpoli #cdnpoli

2949 2018-10-25 18:06:28 Now that I finally think I found something for my face I need a good oil free moisturizer
2950 2018-10-25 18:06:27 A lot of leftist revisionist history here—remember the  “Bush lied people died” bumper stickers— accusing him of allowing 2000 Americans to die to cover up his oil connections or some other garbage.  And then there is Biden accusing Romney of putting black people “back in chains”
2951 2018-10-25 18:06:25 OPEC about to cut crude oil supplies. 
This thing will skyrocket again.
#iransanctions ahead.
2952 2018-10-25 18:06:22 If LDL was the only issue in this study, wouldn’t just changing your fat sources help the cause? Avocados,nuts, seeds, salmon and olive oil have shown to be protective on cholesterol
2953 2018-10-25 18:06:18 I have a funny feeling that I am going to see #AndrewGillum hawking his magic, mystical oil on late night infomercials in the near future. #flapol #flpolitics #FLGov #Sayfie
2954 2018-10-25 18:06:15 Ohh my, what a suprise! LOL 
The blast'em with a Hellfire missle from a Drone administrator ('cause we know he wasn't no president).No interview cuz they'd been blown to itty bits just da way he wanted it.BP oil spill,no cleanup just sank it 2 the bottom.Another coverup.
Poser.
2955 2018-10-25 18:06:09 if it's of comfort to you, the first mention of VZ and Evrofinance on the terminal was written by you in 2009 with the ambitious headline of: Venezuela, Russia Pledge $6.4 Billion to Oil Projects (Update1)
2956 2018-10-25 18:05:50 Ontario and Quebec are buying Nationalized Oil from State owned Oil companies now. Millions of barrels arrive each week from Saudi’s (State owned) Venezuela (State owned) 
Fact is anyone can buy shares in our terrible Oil companies. Yet some prefer socialism like Russia’s oil.
2957 2018-10-25 18:05:47 @Criterion Having a problem getting in touch with your p.r. Working oil CC-related story.  Can you pass along to him/her?  Thanks.
2958 2018-10-25 18:05:33 i honestly don’t know if it does because i also just have extremely sensitive skin but whenever i use tea tree oil it makes my skin CHERRY red and itchy so i might just be allergic lol
2959 2018-10-25 18:05:24 Bitch ass baby oil
2960 2018-10-25 18:05:19 The next big wrong move imo will be when the oil keep bouchard on the team past the 9 game mark.
2961 2018-10-25 18:05:17 which is why they lose.  Too many Demopublicans that need a silver tongued soothsayer who will tell them everythings good while droning the shit out of the ME in the unending Neocon oil war.
2962 2018-10-25 18:05:11 Bouta learn how to do a oil change that way my future boo don't gotta go to the shop to get one
2963 2018-10-25 18:05:07 Fried it on a skillet on high heat with avocado oil and melted butter at the last minute.
2964 2018-10-25 18:04:57 Exactly! I think they use the same 30 weight oil on their hair, so interchangeable.
2965 2018-10-25 18:04:49 "Actually stopping them from setting foot on U.S soil is not in mission statement."

Exactly, it's pointless theater that, if anything, only makes the situation worse.

2969 2018-10-25 18:04:23 nice! we'll have to chat about that - I have never tried oil painting. Currently taking the Sunday afternoon 'abstract methods' with Jason Wells.
2970 2018-10-25 18:04:22 ooo i’ll keep that in mind!! i didn’t know tea tree oil wasn’t good for rosacea
2971 2018-10-25 18:04:16 It’s hormones lovely. We all want perfect skin but sadly some of us produce more oil than others x
2972 2018-10-25 18:04:16 @MichaelAvenatti referred to the DOJ eh?  Couldn’t have happened to a more appropriate snake@oil salesman.  Awesome news little man.
2973 2018-10-25 18:04:07 A3, I hope we can find more effective crops to produce biofuels. Some of the crops we use now are corn, canola, sugarcane, palm oil, jatropha, soybeans, switchgrass. #tsudchs

2974 2018-10-25 18:03:49 Une logique du toujours plus de libéralisme qui aboutit à toujours moins pour le peuple (OC & OIL) qui se voit dépouillé et privé de tout ! #ENMARCHE vers... Le chaos !
2975 2018-10-25 18:03:46 Most people don't know that Mr Ted goes out to the oil fields in the evenings to pump the oil.  Bein a robot, he don't need to sleep.  #MAGA
2976 2018-10-25 18:03:39 Previous AB and federal govts spent tens of millions on oil sands marketing and comms. If you are not credible outside your political base - and Kenney's surely not, not on energy and climate - you're just not going to get traction. Will probably make his base feel good though
2977 2018-10-25 18:03:12 Oil of #OMLAZ
2978 2018-10-25 18:03:09 Hey John thanks for fuking Alberta! Next time you have a gas pipeline explode here's hoping no one is injured. Oil doesn't do that in pipeline s it's actually safe transport.
2979 2018-10-25 18:03:07 Put palm oil
2980 2018-10-25 18:03:01 it isn't cbd oil. ...it is bullshit in a bottle and people are paying good money for the snake oil, thinking they are getting medicine
2981 2018-10-25 18:02:47 Need get out the oil field and get back to school. Being away from home 3/4 of the year is no way to live
2982 2018-10-25 18:02:47 Bakidai biya kudin make up din avi dinki ba koh , i want to pay @halima_kollere
2983 2018-10-25 18:02:46 Not getting much love right now. The loss mostly related to hedging is not to be reoccuring. The exposure to Canadian oil is taking its toll, but European gas pricing,  Brent exposure and a tightening differential are all going to improve.
2984 2018-10-25 18:02:34 How much is the gas bill gonna be? We only have a limited number of years left of oil.
2985 2018-10-25 18:02:34 I had the delightful experience of using some oil of cloves from a bottle I'd kept from living in France years before. Ended up looking like I'd got Bell's Palsy. Days till I got back to normal.

Big lesson: cull your medicines & remedies sensibly eg to pharmacy. Stuff goes off.
2986 2018-10-25 18:02:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
2987 2018-10-25 18:02:26 Jiffy Lube wanted $120 for an oil change. Y’all can go fuck yourselves real quick, THANKS.
2988 2018-10-25 18:02:18 #panamoleo Complexityless: Increase production of palm oil in S.America driven by rising food demand, green policies in biodiesel and govt subsidies to substitute illicit crops e.g. cocaine/poppy
2989 2018-10-25 18:01:57 YouGov busted for interfering in Kurdistan indy ref, for all the good it did them. Kurdistan is obviously a subject close to Zahawi's heart - although he's never actually lived there, but their oil industry paid a lot of his bills rather than tax payers.
2990 2018-10-25 18:01:57 Dawg I keep procrastinating lmao I need to go get this oil change  lemmie get uppppp
2991 2018-10-25 18:01:51 Abeg when they spoil you, don't forget to spoil me
2992 2018-10-25 18:01:47 @elonmusk you should just allow YouTube and bloggers your time and conference calls.  Why give these bullshitters and oil reporters your time? #theyjustwantclickbait
2993 2018-10-25 18:01:25 Although there are many popular health claims boasting the benefits of coconut oil, more studies are needed. Also, remember that 1 tablespoon is 120 calories and 14 grams of fat. When you consume it, be sure to log it.
2994 2018-10-25 18:01:21 So much for Muskrat Falls giving us the big carbon break, going after a green future with today's oil money and blah, blah, blah,  I guess.
2995 2018-10-25 18:01:18 #panamoleo ComplexityLess: Palm oil industry in South America account for at least 6% of world's palm oil production. Expansion in crops in recent years boosted by govt programs
2996 2018-10-25 18:01:15 @KirkCousins8 Hey Kirk, I gotta get my oil changed at Inver grove Toyota, if you stop by I can treat you to some (free) popcorn!
2997 2018-10-25 18:01:12 The back door Colonisation by the Western world through their stooge's is one of our major problem. If elected we will damn the consequences and stop the free oil,economy sabotage, insecurity.....Nigerians  shall determine their destiny.
2998 2018-10-25 18:00:43 It's true that helping to transport and processing will be their main duties. 
Actually stopping them from setting foot on U.S soil is not in mission statement.  
The deterrence factor will be small if at all.
2999 2018-10-25 18:00:42 I really can’t live without Dove soap and coconut oil. Lol

3003 2018-10-25 18:00:24 Yes true. But Who remembers killing of mayor of nefteyugansk? Riddled with bullets on khodorkovsky birthday. Cleared the way for him to take that oil field over as one Yukos 3 big fields. Yukos head of security later convicted of the murder.
3004 2018-10-25 18:00:11 Yeah, cause I’ve lived and worked my entire life in Calgary so I’m totally unaware of how oil and gas works. You might want to learn that it isn’t all rig jobs in Fort Mac

3013 2018-10-25 17:59:20 I might need an oil change
3014 2018-10-25 17:59:17 Your talking point about terrorism is false. The building of nukes is false. And, I wasn't talking about Iran getting the oil, because they didn't.

Saudi aided the 9/11 terrorists with cash, housing and flight lessons. Trump bows down like others. Doesn't mean you should, too.
3015 2018-10-25 17:59:14 I guess blowing off $100mill a day in oil revenue is the central bank's idea of Canada running at optimum productivity.
3016 2018-10-25 17:59:06 ทำไมเป็นคนแบบนี้~ 555555
3017 2018-10-25 17:59:03 I want to help 10 people try CBD oil for 30 days. If it’s not for you for any reason, you will receive a full refund ! Who’s in?
3018 2018-10-25 17:58:56 Big business can pretend that they care about the environment but it’s a con. Especially McDonald’s. Not to be preachy but rearing beef is more harmful to the planet that anything. So then recycling, and turning oil to bio diesel is futile.
3019 2018-10-25 17:58:52 Pouring oil on the water, are we?
3020 2018-10-25 17:58:41 Sometimes when I go to bed I lay there and listen to the doors. Then I think to myself, I really need to put some oil on those hinges.
3021 2018-10-25 17:58:41 This year all around the USA, women will be passing out essential oil samples to trick or treaters.
3022 2018-10-25 17:58:36 O BR nao sabe competir!! É cartel privado ou o governo fecha o mercado como na Taurus/CBC ...
O BR nao está acostumado a competir,exceto minérios ,oil, soja,milho

3025 2018-10-25 17:58:23 There was a lady behind me on an ATM queue she was wearing show me ur back, but d bra strap which was supposed to be white was brown, was so disgusting
3026 2018-10-25 17:58:22 I’m taking the intro to oil painting one :)
3027 2018-10-25 17:58:22 Found the problem, not out of heating oil, landlord plugged in new heat tape, it appears to have tripped the breaker, I checked the oil level, still had 20”, so, should not have been out, I reset the breaker & restarted the furnace 
3028 2018-10-25 17:57:41 .@Samir_Madani will be on Bloomberg TV tomorrow at 11:05am est discussing Iran oil exports. #OOTT

3031 2018-10-25 17:57:29 Connell you have to ask yourself what is the price of an unpunished Brutal Murder worth to the US?? About 8 Bucks a barrel off the price of oil before the midterms...OH YEAH!! Why have an IEA when we have Pres. Trump! Short the market with Trump! @connellmcshane @realDonaldTrump
3032 2018-10-25 17:57:21 Diwali is starting of New business year and is celebrated with oil lamps . was this ritual alive even before Shri Ram's ayodhya return??
3033 2018-10-25 17:57:18 My mom just called me asking where to find CBD oil for my doctor while she’s at work, what is life
3034 2018-10-25 17:57:16 #439, Spanish Proverb
Truth and oil always come to the surface.
3035 2018-10-25 17:57:14 Year 2020 - SC new guidelines for Hindu's festivals -: Oil less Deepak , sugarless sweets not more than 100 gram per person , Dandiyas are not allowed in Navratri it can hurt someone , crackers not allowed at all , u can burst balloon and can make similar sounds .
3036 2018-10-25 17:56:58 EXACTLY! Shorty wanna strip down to her drawls and oil her buttocks and twerk on a Spaulding let her. I appreciate her creativity as well.
3037 2018-10-25 17:56:58 Popeye and Olive Oil. Yin and Yang. Or be each other!
3038 2018-10-25 17:56:39 get your oil changed summer 
3039 2018-10-25 17:56:19 Venezuela is leaning heavily on new investments from China saying it will dramatically boost oil production. China also owns the largest port in Panama and IMO has every reason to incite and finance the Million Migrant March while domestic actors provide equipment and logistics.
3040 2018-10-25 17:56:06 Black soap and tea tree oil(mixed in with your body cream)
You're gonna be glowing
3041 2018-10-25 17:56:05 Went and got my nail fixed... they didn’t charge me 
Went and got my oil changed...didn’t charge me 
3042 2018-10-25 17:56:05 The year is 2020, UCP government run ads saying how despite Rachel Notely and her job killing carbon tax, Alberta has the most ethical oil ever. 

Twist: UCP repealed carbon tax and Notely resigned from the NDP after election loss.
3043 2018-10-25 17:55:33 Wow. You are still selling that snake oil with JP!? Fuck man.
3044 2018-10-25 17:55:31 First wash my face off with water then I have Apple cider vinegar mixed with water (how much is depending on your skin type). But i wipe my face down with that as a toner let it dry Then I made a raw honey, unrefined coconut oil n a couple drops of tea tree oil mask.
3045 2018-10-25 17:55:28 hope you like picking up the soap for Bubba ! hahahahaha remember the Crisco Oil
3046 2018-10-25 17:55:25 £330B is for extracting the oil - not what it is worth. That's in the ££TN's...
3047 2018-10-25 17:55:24 I'm amazed at how they got the American people to sacrifice our military for the appeasement of 1 oil tycoon.
3048 2018-10-25 17:55:22 I dont think this one knows what actually happens on the oil and gas jobs lol
3049 2018-10-25 17:55:15 - I $upport Beto. (O’Rourke running as a progressive in Texas?) 

- Don’t hear the “sacred holy” name of oil mentioned too much. 

- What does the oil petrostate think of Beto & Paris Climate Accords? 

- Texas. Oil. Simply. Does. Not. Care.
3050 2018-10-25 17:55:13 Thanks for your feedback- sounds like a match made in heaven for you! Did you know Fix+ Matte can also be used underneath your makeup (as a prep) for added oil control?  It's more than JUST a setting spray!
3051 2018-10-25 17:55:10 This is another great move by @realDonaldTrump. We need to dig and produce all the oil we can here in North America. We can’t be reliant on the Saudis or the Middle East for our energy. More oil more natural gas. Throw in some nuclear power and our economy will be even better off
3052 2018-10-25 17:55:02 Good to hear lets see Alberta open up to business coal, oil, gas and solar energy etc..... packed out good
3053 2018-10-25 17:55:00 Favorite brand of omega 3’s that don’t contain fish oil??
3054 2018-10-25 17:54:51 Just MOP THE FLOOR with it. Get an oil diffuser

3056 2018-10-25 17:54:48 Yeah he needs to go no one wants to sign not anyone that’s gonna improve. Gonna be along time till they challenge that’s 3 managers so much money spent same shit so needs to be a huge clear out or let the Saudis buy them and spend all that oil money like City 
3057 2018-10-25 17:54:23 They used to light the street lamps of London with Whale oil  !!! Never thought they would run out of Whales.

3059 2018-10-25 17:54:14 Coconut oil and prayer 
3060 2018-10-25 17:53:46 Hi @elonmusk , Why not battery powered locomotives ??. If we have any such, we can simply replace the oil powered locomotives without worrying much about infra upgrade 
3061 2018-10-25 17:53:45 They had the best for the time with little money coming in, villages in iran are more miserable than ever before with the skyrocketing oil profit they had in the past 20 years , Islamic embezzlement is raging in iran without any arrest. We loved shah & wish to glorify him. You ?
3062 2018-10-25 17:53:42 Homie I never said it was shit. I just compared it to oil leaks. It’s fuxkin galactic as balls but I’m just making a lol.
3063 2018-10-25 17:53:34 Until an accident happens and an entire area gets contaminated with oil.  It's unnecessary when we have the technology to drop oil all together.
3064 2018-10-25 17:53:33 Our oil money
3065 2018-10-25 17:53:32 plum oil? hmm
3066 2018-10-25 17:53:29 That's what the market wants. 

And neither Canada nor the US sells or buys oil. Private industry does.

Don't like free markets? Then nationalize.
3067 2018-10-25 17:53:27 I don't  see how ppl say ew when  I get  extra oil and  vinegar on my sub from  publix u don't  see how thick  that  bread is!!!
3068 2018-10-25 17:53:21 “We should not be beholden to middle eastern oil.”

FYI @SenGillibrand, most of America’s oil comes from Canada. #NYSenDebate #CluelessKirsten
3069 2018-10-25 17:53:20 Not to mention the grain is pressed for oil first so it's a byproduct
3070 2018-10-25 17:53:02 They are being sent largely to handle the increased volume of giving people a ride, it's been a long walk, and processing them into the country. 
By now everyone knows catch and release is alive and well.
3071 2018-10-25 17:53:00 weed oil turns any spliff into a lyft
3072 2018-10-25 17:52:57 Also, Sanders is actually a policy *follower*. Most of his 2016 positions were already on Hillary's web site, and Medicare for All actually came from Pelosi's "Medicare Part E: for Everybody."

Sanders is a snake oil salesman. An effective one, but an empty suit nonetheless.
3073 2018-10-25 17:52:56 It’s a form of denialist - not climate denial, but thermodynamics denial. Ppl excuse their own contribution to AGW by reasoning that if oil cos were not so greedy, they would have invented renewable fuels as cheap as ff. But harnessable energy is not cheap in a closed sys.
3074 2018-10-25 17:52:40 coconut oil is also good for the skin
3075 2018-10-25 17:52:39 The irony of watching the puljujarvi saga is if the oil had been patient from the start and we dealt with watching caggiula screw up on a nightly basis in his spot on the 3rd line for the last year or so, I would be the fan yelling at management for refusing to call up JP. Lol
3076 2018-10-25 17:52:10 If you had to pick between getting Free Gas ($100 Dollar Gift Card) Or Getting Three Months of Oil Change on us! Witch Option Do You Prefer?
3077 2018-10-25 17:52:00 @jimrome I’m always at the hash mark too... and oil, and resin.

3081 2018-10-25 17:51:45 I don't see structure here yet.  Klentak & Coconut Oil Gabe both throw stuff against the wall & see if it sticks.  Definitely not the right approach
3082 2018-10-25 17:51:30 I think there needs to be a shakedown of the blatant corruption in our government on both sides,it’s obvious that something shady is  going on that is letting the Americans continue to get cheap oil. We possibly can’t be this stupid!! Can we?
3083 2018-10-25 17:51:30 Hahaha bhut vadia veere #TaraMeera  jo beejya janda kheta ch ohda oil banda m i right #pure #pendu
3084 2018-10-25 17:51:21 Yep. Why I want to learn how to change my oil so I can save on little shit and not complain about the labor intensive activities. I would refer to my mechanic but he’s been swamped with family issues
3085 2018-10-25 17:51:07 I remember you years ago in heaven,string vest covered in olive oil.dancing with long John baldrey. ,those was the days your worship.
3086 2018-10-25 17:50:35 Anyone that has tried CBD knows it isn't snake oil. 

It mimics a compound our bodies make endogenously. CBD means health again.
3087 2018-10-25 17:50:25 you need to put a lot of oil there to make it fluid. 
seldom they use chocolate butter for that :D
3088 2018-10-25 17:50:25 ‘Take 5 oil change’ is the smartest idea anyone has ever had
3089 2018-10-25 17:50:09 Starting this week we will no longer be making appointments for Express Service Work (oil changes, tires, filters, etc.). These services will be handled on a first come first serve basis. Our hours are Monday thru Friday 7:30-6:00 and Saturday 8:00-3:00.
3090 2018-10-25 17:50:02 That looks like motor oil or sth Jesus
3091 2018-10-25 17:50:01 Canada’s only Export customer is USA who buy our oil at a 30’/, discount. Then US sells Oil to Ont & Que @ actual world price. We lose tens of Billions that could go to Prescription Drug Plan, Shorter Surgery lists, Daycare, Seniors, Vets.
Ont & Que buy Saudi & Venezuela oil. Why
3092 2018-10-25 17:49:48 Accidentally put peppermint oil all over my face this morning instead of frankensense. Thats one way to wake yourself up.

3107 2018-10-25 17:48:22 So sad how the Liberals' very bad decision makers are burying Canada in overwhelming debt. Having their paid protesters fight  PM Harper's pipeline, transport to China via Fraser R. &shutdown Oil industry Then turning around and doing what Harper wanted to( 4-5 yrs ago)!!!
3108 2018-10-25 17:48:15 For the Red Thai Garnish- Red Bell Pepper, Onion, Granules, Demerara Sugar, Dessicated Coconut, Basil Leaves, Rapeseed Oil.

3110 2018-10-25 17:48:11 Brutal schedule for the oil
3111 2018-10-25 17:48:11 Seriously what? Wenger had Chelsea at their height of spending and the initial splurges of oil cash from City. He still maintained us whilst losing best players to balance books - give him some credit and still managed the odd cup towards end.
3112 2018-10-25 17:48:05 GEJ sacked Sanusi as the CBN Governor because he told us that billions of oil money was missing which turned out to be true and appointed Emefiele to replace him.

Buhari came few months later and retained Emefiele, a Delta born Christian yet that Buhari is vengeful.

#SWA
3113 2018-10-25 17:47:48 We're getting screwed on prices 'cause we have bitumen which is difficult to process and difficult to transport by pipeline. Thanks to fracking there's an oil glut. Even if we had a eastern pipeline, we still don't have enough refineries to process it.
3114 2018-10-25 17:47:43 Which essential oil will get rid of you snooping around the Detroit underground art scene?
3115 2018-10-25 17:47:40 The murder grams aren't nearly as big an issue as the idea that some college kid somewhere might want to interfere with an oil pipeline. Capitalist gangster states have their priorities.
3116 2018-10-25 17:47:31 Yes!... And roasted in olive oil... Whatever next? 
3117 2018-10-25 17:47:19 LOVE THESE
I actually buy these to retail to my clients in their aftercare kits I make. It’s to cleanse the lash extensions to keep away oil/bacteria build up. I use it on myself too! Definitely will be purchasing again, As it’s the best price too!

3119 2018-10-25 17:47:07 That is why the money thrown into the construction industries doesn't make any meaningful impact. "The nation is rotten to the marrows." PDP spent 16 years and wasted the oil boom. Now who do we trust. I understand your (our) pains.
3120 2018-10-25 17:46:57 I deadass get an oil change every month
3121 2018-10-25 17:46:52 Vaccinations cause lizard-morphing! Don’t vaccinate!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
3122 2018-10-25 17:46:41 Why aren't you negotiating oil prices. Coffers as you put it is a start but not all American's indulge.
3123 2018-10-25 17:46:41 Charter School in Florida are not much different the the Industrials Rehab Complex. What’s real is that snake oil salesmen get into the practice for their own gain. Exceptions are not the rule.

Miss me
3124 2018-10-25 17:46:22 Hmmm great question.
3125 2018-10-25 17:46:18 @georgegalloway Do you recall during the Indy Ref sitting on stage lying to school kids about the oil running out? News about new oil fields was already breaking. Hope you're proud? #traitor #liar

The mailman or a mailman?
3133 2018-10-25 17:45:48 I measure everything in terms of my vices. Lol just got my Godson some jackets. Total price was $70 BUT I spend $65+ on oil refills for my vape pens so that’s not expensive 
3134 2018-10-25 17:45:33 Some low toxicity alternatives to Sevin and other conventional insecticides that gardeners can use are: insecticidal soap, horticultural oils, neem oil and the microbial insecticides. These materials are safer to apply, very efficient and much less damaging.

3136 2018-10-25 17:45:15 just put oil in Lao's hot sauce. now we wait.
3137 2018-10-25 17:45:06 We also have one of the largest supplies of renewable energy, let's start acting like it, instead of burning away our limited supply of oil, which is much more important in the long term for use in plastics and medicine. #oil #polqc #abpoli #cdnpoli #bcpoli #polcan Irresponsible
3138 2018-10-25 17:44:49 since my cartridge broke I feel like I’m wasting the oil when I use the pen so I’m about to just put it in a blunt and call it a day

3140 2018-10-25 17:44:36 Going by myself to get my oil changed makes me feel like a grown ass woman
3141 2018-10-25 17:44:26 Fake news. This is not a natio al emergency. Just another ginned up fear tactic to activate your base for the midterms. You're nothing more than a cheap snake oil salesman.
3142 2018-10-25 17:44:10 Does cocoa butter moisturizing oil really make you darker???
3143 2018-10-25 17:44:05 You are right, that's why I say the so called mega infrastructure projects and other projects are but snake oil projects which has no return on investment. They are used as channels to loot.
3144 2018-10-25 17:43:51 Build Energy East.  Stop importing their oil.  
a) More punishing
b) Sell our oil to other markets without massive discount
c) Less reliant on whims of the US
d) Collect more taxes
e) Fund more of our social programs
f) Makes us look less stupid.
3145 2018-10-25 17:43:44 Lol you do realize how many albertans are out of work from the oil and gas industries right now, don't you?
3146 2018-10-25 17:43:41 Which essential oil helps to get rid of my existential pain?

3150 2018-10-25 17:43:21 I just use baby oil and baby powder which works out way cheaper

3153 2018-10-25 17:42:22 So I’m not big on alternative medicine, but I tried taking CBD oil for my Crohn’s disease and I literally started feeling better over night. So maybe modern medicine is some bullshit 
3154 2018-10-25 17:42:21 While all the speakers are talking about the oil price differential, sadly nobody has used the phrase “bitumen bubble”! #EnergyRelaunch
3155 2018-10-25 17:42:20 But you enjoyed DJ Arafat's music
3156 2018-10-25 17:42:09 Yes 3 billion for 1 year in fixed. 
3 billion in shape of oil in an year( total 3 years)

USA produced more oil than Russia for the first time since 1999!

Trump annihilated 300 Russians on the battlefield.

Your liberal ignorance is astonishing only surpassed by your liberal hypocrisy.

3163 2018-10-25 17:41:27 You know that dream where you're driving around Wyoming with Tilda Swinton & you stop at a big old ranch house that's now a historic site & in the gift shop you look for books that explain who sold all the land to oil companies? I had that last night.
3164 2018-10-25 17:41:23 just beautiful ..I wonder how much or little oil could create the same results

3191 2018-10-25 17:38:23 My 2nd big question for Trudeau would be instead of a carbon tax to reduce our emissions, why aren`t we working on lowering our footprint & using Canadian oil instead of threatening the planet having it hauled overseas from somewhere else? Wouldn`t homegrown mean lower footprint?
3192 2018-10-25 17:38:19  Add oil
3193 2018-10-25 17:38:18 I encourage everyone to vote YES on 1631! This will charge big oil for pollution and force them to reduce the carbon emissions! Those who support vote no are BP, Phillips 66, and other big oil companies! Check out who is paying for the opposition campaign!

3198 2018-10-25 17:37:33 You're going to inform them of a leak that they claim never happened and say they have seen/inspected everything? EPA already ordered them to halt operations, but they're denying that too. 

What next? They'll deny the existence of oil as well?
3199 2018-10-25 17:37:28 Well in a round about sort of way we are all funding it with fuelling our cars...as the majority of oil is from Saudi

3217 2018-10-25 17:35:16 @ImranKhanPTI Sir I want to draw your attention towards recent oil spill at Churna Island, due to which clear blue water turns totally black. This is destroying marine life and ecosystem at that area very badly. Churna Island is one of the most breathtaking tourist point.

Okay
3250 2018-10-25 17:32:12 I respect that opinion. Selling weapons of war is certainly morally problematic. Canada meanwhile buys most of their oil from the Saudis. Canadian cash flows directly to the kingdom which they can use to buy weapons from other nations.

3290 2018-10-25 17:27:37 There’s no rational reason why an investor should not be bullish on an organisation that has the first mover’s advantage on Electric cars before which, oil burning cars are destined to be obsolete junk..

3292 2018-10-25 17:27:34 Mine have been bad because of all of the rain.  Just the opposite.  

I'm good.  Just cleaned up olive oil from the floor.  Of course that was the only bag that broke coming into the house.

3294 2018-10-25 17:27:13 30 years ago I got into a fight with a bunch of guys and went back at night and pulled my oil pan pin in the paint.  Mfers we’re trying to soak it up with Cat Litter for days.

3307 2018-10-25 17:26:11 It struck me, when this read that MBS was trying to wean his country off oil, whether this could have been a conspiracy by big oil to get rid of him.  They definitely do not like anyone trying to seek alternative energy resources; it will mean an end to their outrageous profits.

3313 2018-10-25 17:25:27 chiarelli usually does not win trades so oil likely gives up more in the deal :) i love nylander so don't want him traded. he is just going to get better. nurse played for dubas and was his captain in the soo so there is that tho....and pooly has a lot of upside if used properly.

Interdict defense deal with US, prohibit oil supply to US, grab major clients of US, dissociate events conducted in US. Develop UN substitute to serve weak nations. Restrain US barbarism & vandalism
3318 2018-10-25 17:25:08 I need an oil change but I dont wanna go do it right now
3319 2018-10-25 17:25:08 Hydration is very important in the fall when the temperatures are cooler. The products you use to reduce oil in your skin and to prevent acne from forming usually depletes a lot of water.

3321 2018-10-25 17:24:31 RT younglivingeo itry2frog1st We're so happy our oil was able to help you out in some way Denise! 
3322 2018-10-25 17:24:14 Seriously tho, you’re supporting the worst humanitarian crisis & famine the world has seen in over a hundred years. Saudi Arabia’s actions in Yemen is an ongoing genocide over oil. They’re dropping US bombs & we’re about to supply the next few yrs worth. It’s never been “this”
3323 2018-10-25 17:24:13 Ako rin, wala akong pake doon. I saw it in her post in IG, she's making soap and oil. Is she planning to compete with Wellness? Di ba may oil din sila? Pati ba naman business, sinusulot na rin?
3324 2018-10-25 17:24:10 There's no denying that India made tech transfer as a benchmark to make defence deals with India. Transfer of technology was part of S-400 negotiations. Did that actually happen? That's a state secret for now. Russians were asking a huge price for that. A major reason for delay.
3325 2018-10-25 17:23:50 @SouthsideSteve your boys at   @Regal_Nissan are dropping the ball I have been trying to get a price on an oil change and fuel filter change for a 20K service on the Titan Cummings. And I bought the truck from them last year.

3331 2018-10-25 17:23:17 EXACTLY... not to mention the auto industry could’ve converted to electric years ago and continues to fuck the population for oil.... smh
3332 2018-10-25 17:23:16 Hi too little too late. There is no guaranteed certified palm oil. Just DON'T use it

3336 2018-10-25 17:22:37 Of course Kavanaugh suppressed a climate change concern over big oil.

3344 2018-10-25 17:21:48 1/3 Okay, one more crazy theory. I believe a lot of the decline between ~2006 and 2010 is due to previous reporting accuracy. I worked in the BC Oil & Gas Engineering sector and around that time our clients received mandates to reduce their GHG and to accurately report CO2.
3345 2018-10-25 17:21:39 PLEASE GET AN OIL CHANGE THIS SHIT AINT NO JOKE

3356 2018-10-25 17:20:30 Carbon tax is great, but how about policies to keep tar sands oil in the ground instead of the government building new pipelines? That's a lot of carbon.
3357 2018-10-25 17:20:23 So for a GOP voter, it's acceptable to murder hundreds of thousands of innocents over oil, but a woman can't take responsibility for her pregnancy? 

By law, Planned Parenthood can't use federal funding for abortions. Abortions only represent 3% of PP's provided service's.

3360 2018-10-25 17:20:17 I believe most people, as on issue of guns, have caught the lie in this. Follow money: guns, NRA; climate, oil.
3361 2018-10-25 17:20:17 There are some parallels in the story of the widow's oil with those of Sodom & the Exodus. 2 Kings 4:1-7
>Destitute & enslaved.
>Shut up in the house overnight.
>Looted the neighbors.
>Redeemed from slavery.
3362 2018-10-25 17:20:14 David is in a good mood and I love it, when he’s joking around. „If I can use THIS as well on you, I‘m into it.“ I say and point out to the huge silicon cock, he’s teasing me with. We grab the black plastic sheet with the oil, a few vibrators and the king and queen costumes, ~~
3363 2018-10-25 17:20:04 Because sometimes it's like I'm doing an oil change (by example) and you're all like, 'Pay attention to ME.. THIS IS YOUR FAULT.. let ME give you an attitude.. fucking argue with me... I want something.. me.. me. Me.."
3364 2018-10-25 17:20:00 I remember the naked part, but were they really covered in olive oil back then? Lol
3365 2018-10-25 17:19:53 So the media was fixated on the price of the oil and if we could have the £. The reality was people were given a chance to talk about reforming FPTP,  creeping privatisation, NHS, the left behind,  the 1%, the bankers being bailed out and the poorest and disabled paying the price
3366 2018-10-25 17:19:52 Do y’all know if I do a banana, honey, and olive oil hair mask if it’s cool for me to leave with it in overnight?

3395 2018-10-25 17:17:24 Thank you so much for including Jewish tradition in your holidays. I hope to see many more traditions added in the future!

My 2 cents… sufganyot would make more sense for a winter holiday dessert, and they’re special for Hanukkah (fried in oil). You can get B&W cookies anytime.

3412 2018-10-25 17:15:58 Oil production is at record highs. And exports are 400% higher than imports. 

Private corporations control the oil not Canadians. 

Because we are the "sort of Country" to be the only major oil exporting country not to nationalize the industry in anyway.

3420 2018-10-25 17:15:02 Kid Fury’s quick review of this season of AHS is how I’ve been feeling  and couldn’t put into words  bottom line I need to throw holy water and oil in every corner of my house after watching each episode
3421 2018-10-25 17:14:56 *Youngers goes to Orschelns between classes for fun*
“I walked around orschelns for an hour... and i decided to buy some oil.”
“what’d you buy that for?”
“my raptor... in case she gets thirsty”
3422 2018-10-25 17:14:55 So, in summary, the increase in the subsidy due to the exchange rate effect outweighed the decrease in subsidy due to the oil price fall and fuel price increase effect. Subsidy increased from N40 to N53. /END
3423 2018-10-25 17:14:52 1-no 
2- stop bombing countries for oil
3424 2018-10-25 17:14:34 I personally love canned artichokes, olives, tuna (in oil) and other things!

3430 2018-10-25 17:14:17 Do North Indians have a ritual oil bath (अभ्यंग स्नान) before the dawn? In Maharashtra, this practice is widely followed. Some people take outdoor baths. :-)
3431 2018-10-25 17:14:16 Nigerians no longer trust the leadership especially on the issue of oil prices. 
 Pmb increased prices of petroleum  product with No corresponding value for the increase to Date
3432 2018-10-25 17:14:00 how about S400 ?????
3433 2018-10-25 17:13:59 I gotta get a oil change
3434 2018-10-25 17:13:56 I wonder which oil company will profit from the new fields since 2014?
3435 2018-10-25 17:13:51 i don’t need food i run on hatred for oil companies
3436 2018-10-25 17:13:50 We are tired of talk shows we need results cooking oil is costing 20 dollars here but always we hear of mega deals
3437 2018-10-25 17:13:48 Western morals and principles going down the oil pipelines, Mohammed bin salman is standing tall. 
3438 2018-10-25 17:13:46 Is because of exchange rate that is why govt subsidize that is why when crude oil was 115 dollars we stil bought fuel at 87. Goverment is subsidizing petrol by 53 naira we still buy it at 145. The landing cost of fuel now is 150 naira per litre so what is govt susbsizing?
3439 2018-10-25 17:13:41 Claro y la historia lo dice. La Standard Oil e @IBM con Hitler, @Halliburton  y un largo etcétera. Los mercados soportan TODO menos que los hagas perder dinero. Los ejemplos que citas no tienen ningún impacto en el mercado, el de la suspensión SI. Los hará perder dinero.
3440 2018-10-25 17:13:37 But some sources says the helicopters flowed its oil on the fire in order to burn the hole shops , ( it was order)
3441 2018-10-25 17:13:35 Oil before putting on.
3442 2018-10-25 17:13:32 Central Florida friends... your favorite pizza place? I'm from Pittsburgh and miss bubbly, airy crusts. So many pizza places here disappoint me with crust that all look/taste no better than cardboard brushed with some olive oil. Help me with my stress eating 
3443 2018-10-25 17:13:18 Watching STV I'm astonished that a country surrounded by massive gas and oil fields, is struggling to fund its NHS.
3444 2018-10-25 17:12:49 Wait until the Saudis do something silly with the OIL, they will learn!
3445 2018-10-25 17:12:45 You know that the unfettered promotion of oil development is no longer politically popular... better to support carbon pricing and an incremental approach to a low-carbon economy... a unified national purpose to build pipelines needs the support of greens. #cdnpoli
3446 2018-10-25 17:12:34 Y’all wanna know why girls don’t get their oil changed when they should? We’re working extra hours to cover bills that don’t care about the wage gap. We’re raising kids that men don’t pay for. We’re maintaining a household wout help. We’re BUSY. BITCH, YOU CHANGE MY OIL!
3447 2018-10-25 17:12:32 Let backup the unforgettable history. Carnegie from another country help in developing USA but with intervention of john Rockefeller as the oil magnet in USA. During the time his oil company supplies 80per of what USA is consuming with the help of US gov't. But now why dangote
3448 2018-10-25 17:12:29 Why did I read oli name as oil
3449 2018-10-25 17:12:14 This oil would come down the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and put on tankers to be shipped for refining in California and Washington State. This is evidence of how cap-and-trade is a False Solution. What is the use of putting a price on carbon if the Arctic is destroyed for crude oil?
3450 2018-10-25 17:12:14 He is a great fund raiser for the lnp. We know the way into the lnp heart is with money and being able to be creative. Robert is a snake oil salesmen and con artist. If there is a buck in it he’s there.
3451 2018-10-25 17:11:57 cobain medicated oil, deh kalo belom pernah. lebih ampuh dan baunya lebih enak gitu kalo buat ogut sih. Four Season Medicated Oil
3452 2018-10-25 17:11:47 Oil would cost more is the thing. And we’d need to work out on our end a transition to getting it elsewhere or refining it here. Not so easy.
3453 2018-10-25 17:11:43 Just for your info I'm going seed oil free for 30 days to see if carbs are so problematic by themselves! Wish me luck (atm I eat other stuff then meat almost forcing myself to think it is food XD)

3459 2018-10-25 17:11:02 Bitch do you know your supposed to get an oil change every 3k miles bitches was tryna blow they engine out lmao
3460 2018-10-25 17:10:57 @pencheon1: we can do things differently. Public deserve better. Planet deserves better. We need everyone’s input to test our ideas. Climate change the biggest challenge. ‘Soil, not oil’ #FFCcommission
3461 2018-10-25 17:10:50 Yep. Don't bet against a guy who controls $600 billion cash and 235 billion barrels of oil.
3462 2018-10-25 17:10:40 I'm so adult rn. Voted, got my oil changed, and my flu shot all in one week. I should get to lay in bed and binge watch something now, right?

Not just the oil industry’s lust for money!
Wake up and don’t listen to their propaganda!
Vote!
3464 2018-10-25 17:10:28 I think we both agree on the same thing--just different ways about it. I do wish Canada would exert more pressure. Like cutting oil, water or lumber off. Or even say ok this is the *last* deal. Something like that eh
3465 2018-10-25 17:10:24 Bwisit na mukha to pwede na mag oil exploration dito
3466 2018-10-25 17:10:21 It's not where the resources that are being discussed, are located and if you look at the basin where the oil, is concentrated the most, it's pretty much where they live. At the end of the day the indigenous ppl who live there, should be at the table where decision is being made
3467 2018-10-25 17:10:20 ウルフもハイエナも事情があるんだって
3468 2018-10-25 17:10:19 @EvansZhandire I asked the same question wen I saw the video, I wondered how a *NAN* tin can sustain combustion of Oil, at least thats wat I thot wen I first heard "Generator running on used oil". Then I listened & heard it's a motor running on battery. I Like his spirit though.

3473 2018-10-25 17:09:48 Ben, I have always respected you to some degree as you say both positive and negative, but to say it’s all on djeno is not true, if the sands and mengo come in that’s approx 600 bopd plus the workovers at current oil price for a company of this market cap, do the maths
3474 2018-10-25 17:09:43 Thieves oil
3475 2018-10-25 17:09:41 Venezuelan people are starving to death, the pictures are not of people that are  starving by a long stretch. Venezuela is Oil rich...critical thinking needed here. Does Honduras have something to gain by pointing the finger at another country whose people are just trying to live
3476 2018-10-25 17:09:33 Government revenue does not come from Oil alone Oga
3477 2018-10-25 17:09:22 Actually it was something like "shale not being profitable with oil price under 50 USD".
3478 2018-10-25 17:09:12 Cetaphil >>> Coconut Oil
3479 2018-10-25 17:09:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i dream of the genius works at the worst llsif character.
3480 2018-10-25 17:09:08 So, oil price reduced from $115 to $80, subsidy reduces by 30%. Petrol price increases from N87 to N145, subsidy reduces by 67%, BUT exchange rate increases from N120 to N305, subsidy increases by 154%.
Net change in subsidy = 154% - 67% - 30% = 57% ... /2
3481 2018-10-25 17:08:59 If the non oil sector can’t provide that amount it means those sectors are dying and are not growing like this govt claim
3482 2018-10-25 17:08:42 That beard oil

3484 2018-10-25 17:08:28 Texas deserves better than Cruz, all I see is a snake oil salesman.
3485 2018-10-25 17:08:18 Also try to invest in matifying primers. That helps with oil control
3486 2018-10-25 17:08:14 can my skin stop mass producing oil already bitch I drink enough water
3487 2018-10-25 17:07:57 I think that's a good idea.  We should also get rid of clamshell packaging.  It takes a lot of oil to make those plastics and that isms oil and plastics that could go towards medical devices and such.
3488 2018-10-25 17:07:51 You can never correct someone when your attitude is packaged in an envelope of hatred&revenge. Regardless of your smooth talk the distasteful bitterness floats like oil on water. Relax! love is the only practical avenue to deliver corrections. Let GOD guide you. Anger-Off,WIN IT!
3489 2018-10-25 17:07:45 WE pay even more tax than India. That's why we pay 146 for a ltr or intrntnl crude oil prices are same for everone. Practice aptitude from RS agrawal kt helps and start eating badam with Chwanprash.
3490 2018-10-25 17:07:41 butter melts on steak , drizzle oil on steak, always a bunch left over and butter solidifies on plate with oil in it like a sauce  lol... sounds like nothin special but that blew my mind first time i seen it
3491 2018-10-25 17:07:32 Three alarm fire.Trump is pouring oil on the flames.There are no grownups in the rooms. It looks like Mattis is following orders re sending troops to border. Nothing is holding back the fascist cult of Trump. Maybe sane State legislators can do something? Dark, dark times! Vote.
3492 2018-10-25 17:07:30 Oil Prices steadied near their lowest level in two months with OPEC signalling that it may curb output within months.
3493 2018-10-25 17:07:26 Tar sand oil is not in anyone’s future.

3495 2018-10-25 17:07:16 Maybe we would have less gold star families if the government stopped funding endless, expanding war across the globe. Then maybe their children wouldn't be slaughtered for cheap oil. Anyway, can't wait to vote against you again in 2020, Benjamin!

3503 2018-10-25 17:06:38 Onunkwo Chidi Nnaoma~ oil is not infinite. In the next 10- 20 years, the fossil fuel usage will almost vanish and alternative energy will rise dramatically. Nigerians should start being creative. In agreement with @ProfOsinbajo

3513 2018-10-25 17:05:26 @AlbertaatNoon Jim Prentice told us, “in terms of who is responsible, we need only look in the mirror.” When he was Premier about 20% of gov't revenues was from oil/gas and our debt was $12B, mismanagement? Carbon levy is our responsibility, entitled Conservatives. User pay!
3514 2018-10-25 17:05:18 As long as there is oil to be extracted and weapons to be sold, the US’ support will be unconditional no matter what the Saudis do. Yemenese people are being slaughtered and starved to death, and the US doesn’t even lift a finger. So stop lying to your people for cryin’ out loud.

3519 2018-10-25 17:04:27 You cannot blame the connection of the US with the Saudis on the fact, that both, Salman and Trump are uber rich. We're depending on oil. Saudi Arabia has the most. Usually, we would just invade them and take it. But it is the holy land of a bunsh of billion people.
3520 2018-10-25 17:04:27 I got a host of things and I’m already eyeing more lol. The Lactic Acid, caffeine eye gel, the natural moisturizer, Argan oil (hair), and Marine Hyaluronic. I’m returning the sunscreen, I looked pasty.

1. If crude oil price falls, subsidy falls, ceteris paribus (other things being equal).
2. If exchange rate increases, subsidy increases, ceteris paribus
3. If the price of petrol is increased, the subsidy reduces, ceteris paribus /1

3530 2018-10-25 17:03:18 I just want the discussion to start on how Canada can become self-reliant on our own oil, while also keeping Enviro/Indigenous/Other interests in mind and how does *Canada* wean itself from oil.

3533 2018-10-25 17:03:13 Seems like >50% of economic trends in past 4 years have been driving by oil related investment
3534 2018-10-25 17:03:10 No. I literally mean shill for industry.

Oil production is at record highs but our "friends" in the industry won't hire.
3535 2018-10-25 17:03:09 @jkenney Relaunch must better than 44 years of mismanagement unplanned oil development under the PC/UCP team.

3536 2018-10-25 17:03:08 Can’t forget about oil too.

3543 2018-10-25 17:02:51 Oh come on! Conservatives would never approve of nationalizing oil infrastructure. Liberals also accepted NDP AB govts carve out of oil sands emissions growth of nearly 50%. Their track record on this file is worse than abysmal it’s fraudulent. Saying one thing and doing another.
3544 2018-10-25 17:02:06 Stormwater runoff is polluted with trash, chemicals, bacteria & sediments (e.g., motor oil, chewing gum, dog poop). Can lead to more flooding. Can intensify droughts. Can trigger sewer overflows. #TPLStormwater

3552 2018-10-25 17:01:06 Another selfish oil and gas shill proving oil and gas is only looking out for themselves at the expense of the rest of us.
3553 2018-10-25 17:01:02 Nope, they actually didn’t recommend anything else! I thought I was going to need all the extra shit because my car was louder than normal and braking kind of rough but turns out I was just 3,000 miles overdue for an oil change 
3554 2018-10-25 17:00:58 Sounds like more fun than the oil change Im doing on my truck right now lol.
3555 2018-10-25 17:00:55 Best CBD oil out there, and great bang for the buck!

3581 2018-10-25 16:59:11 Olive oil sometimes helps. You can buy little bottles of sterile stuff from pharmacies.

3592 2018-10-25 16:58:08 We will continue to sell this unstable regime arms and ammo because it is good for the economy-we dont have scruples as a country.  All about the dollar and oil.

3597 2018-10-25 16:57:43 Actually it’s because you can get oil at a reasonable $80 a barrel. Now, why oil is available at $80 a barrel is another more complicated geopolitical story

3602 2018-10-25 16:57:15 My issue is that Saudi oil isn't *clean* & if we want to stop buying from such regimes, Canada needs to have discussion on how to become self sustaining so we're not reliant upon Saudi oil. At same time, let's also discuss how we're going to wean ourselves off of oil.

3615 2018-10-25 16:55:48 Practically and politically, this is not possible. 

One would require a state that doesn’t buy oil nor asks for financial aid from #SaudiArabia - nor sells weapons to them - to perform the role of a “neutral arbitrator”.

3620 2018-10-25 16:55:15 The reason this nation is so divided cannot fully be leveled on the media, social or no.

3622 2018-10-25 16:55:06 I noticed a photograph of a train carrying oil. So, it seems the choices for transporting oil are train and pipelines. How about transporting no oil?

3635 2018-10-25 16:53:59 The solution seemed #obvious. He had dug deep down into the ground in the old cellar. Dug until the witch's skull, yellowed and cracked, grinned up at him among a jumble of odd bones. Doused it in salt and oil and burned it all. But the screaming wouldn't stop.

3637 2018-10-25 16:53:50 you have a gauge for your oil pressure, a dipstick for your oil level, and all you need to check your tire pressure is a tire pressure gauge which is like $3; shaped like a pen, you just unscrew the valve caps and press it on tight. I think your tires should be at 32psi

3642 2018-10-25 16:52:58 Considering the U.K. was instrumental in creating the House of Saud, this claim that we somehow came along later & sold our soul for an oil deal is laughable, but typical state approved “dissidence” of the kind Jones writes. Pointing this out got me blocked some time ago.
3643 2018-10-25 16:52:53 I will not lie, I am terrible with keeping up with stuff with my car. Oil changes, battery checks, etc. I fucking suck.
3644 2018-10-25 16:52:52 I also have a sticker on my window from Jiffy Lube telling me the mileage for my next oil change. Lol. But I've been procrastinating. All the oil change places are far from my house. So I bought 5 quarts from AutoZone this AM and filled my car up.
3645 2018-10-25 16:52:50 $1.60 gas in BC isn't reducing fuel usage or causing an exodus to electric vehicles.

Cancelling TMX, LNG, Site C, stopping all exploratory permits for oil/gas, letting existing contracts run their course.

3691 2018-10-25 16:48:57 When Govs hijack Climate Science it’s no longer Science but just another SJW/Leftist Revenue Stream.

There’s a reason why the word “Government” shows up in the IPCC initials, as in “Intergovernmental”

Alarmists talk about deniers in pockets of big oil

Alarmists r in Govs pockt

3693 2018-10-25 16:48:55 Who said I would cook you to death? If I kill you, I won't get what I want... So I can keep you alive... Just barely, But I can work. I have plenty of free time to dunk your head in boiling oil..
 Keep in mind I can make you float to where you can do anything BUT FLOAT...
3694 2018-10-25 16:48:50 Oh the power of lemon essential oil. A red permanent marker went through the wash and ended up all over Inside my washing machine. This is what my rag looked like after I used lemon and my machine completely clean.
3695 2018-10-25 16:48:49 I won't totally agree with you on that, see .@MBuhari got into power at a time oil wasn't booming, foreign reserves almost depleted, he took all these and still forged ahead.
3696 2018-10-25 16:48:48 this woman sitting next to me while i’m getting my oil changed keeps trying to talk to me while i have headphones in & every time i’m like WHAT
3697 2018-10-25 16:48:45 This all looks really positive and certainly going in the right direction here.
Thank you Adrian.

3700 2018-10-25 16:48:34 If we didn't buy their oil, they wouldn't have the money to buy weapons would they? But then the NIMBYs don't want fracking or oil exploration or nuclear here so what do they expect?
3701 2018-10-25 16:48:33 Free oil change is cool but I hate waiting lol
3702 2018-10-25 16:48:15 Should we stop buying oil from them? Should we refuse their wealthy students entry? Will it have any impact on their behaviour? What if alienation from the west makes this influential actor behave even worse?
3703 2018-10-25 16:48:06 ขอทราบจุดประสงค์
3704 2018-10-25 16:47:56 There you go.. We all havta have a oil *crunch* in life... 
3705 2018-10-25 16:47:35 The proposed budget was N9 trill. Oil revenue is less then 60% of that. Despite N1 tr from Customs, there is still a deficit. And with output at less than 1.8m bpd, there is a shortfall. 
Hence budget has been reviewed to N8tr.

3709 2018-10-25 16:46:51 @realDonaldTrump America are biggest oil exporter but not who made price. Monopoly are detained by Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar. I intend to change the vector. When America will made the price detaining monopoly then effect will be reflected on DJIA level, public debt, deficit.
3710 2018-10-25 16:46:40 I have an oil change at 7 then I’m free
3711 2018-10-25 16:46:40 You should use calendula oil. It's done wonders for my skin. I think one bottle costs like $25.00 but it lasts a long time.
3712 2018-10-25 16:46:36 no wonder he is so good at selling snake oil!!!
3713 2018-10-25 16:46:33 Tell that to 300 Russians Trump annihilated on the battlefield which evidently you know nothing about or you wouldn't make such asinine tweets.

USA produced more oil than Russia for the first time since 1999

3724 2018-10-25 16:45:50 That's probably not just on California's coast, and oil spills do not help either.
3725 2018-10-25 16:45:50 Van Jones calling the 2016 election a "Whitelash"... it's all racist. The fact white people that admire a black character or superhero cant dress up as such is racist. You don't combat racism by setting racial boundaries... my thoughts.
3726 2018-10-25 16:45:48 Heard about the Byco’s oil pipeline under water has been bursted near coastal area of khi. Massive spill. Is this news true ? @amarguriro @zofeen28 @rafay_alam

3736 2018-10-25 16:44:54 Ah, insults. The domain of those with no argument. 

Your economy is growing at twice the rate ours is. You’re grtting tax cuts and more cuts, we got tax hikes and new taxes. You’re allowed to drill your oil, we’re pretending we don’t need it. 

Why would you leave?
3737 2018-10-25 16:44:48 That alpha fish oil doing its trick?  Lol!!
3738 2018-10-25 16:44:46 You have a country with great oil wealth in a rising market where people are leaving in droves because they are destitute. Easy to blame the Americans (always a handy excuse for the left) but the only ones to blame are Chavez and his successors whom Corbyn emulates.

3740 2018-10-25 16:44:22 The Gulf Coast has tremendous offshore oil reserves. Florida and California and Oregon also have them. Trouble is California and Oregon won't play fair with the rest of us that provide them with crude. Pity about that, I know politics will never let this be even discussed!
3741 2018-10-25 16:44:20 Oh me?

3742 2018-10-25 16:44:19 i forgot how to put oil in my car

3750 2018-10-25 16:43:28 Moving oil and gas can also be accomplished via pipeline. It would require significant collaboration between nations and cutting red-tape with environmental agencies, but could be significantly safer to humans and effective year-round. #UCBAMKTG2080
3751 2018-10-25 16:43:18 Both PCs and Liberals are against the stronger federal environmental review process because can't go having anything slow down pumping the precious oil
3752 2018-10-25 16:42:47 Mexico will NEVER keep them. That country has rid itself of millions of their own (joyfully). US currency sent to family in Mex is larger income than tourism and oil/gas production.
3753 2018-10-25 16:42:37 I think people throw around the world to casually. To be offended about a racial comment such as "that black guy over there" is by definition, racist. People should be able to dress up for Halloween as anyone they admire, the fact white people can't... is actually racist. Sooo...
3754 2018-10-25 16:42:32 I’ve had the wife’s car since Monday. I’ve had to fill it up with fuel, too the oil up, adjust tyre pressures, top up the washer fluid and fix the poxy boot switch.
I handed her my car after fuelling it, and checking all of the fluids. Equality my fat arse.
3755 2018-10-25 16:42:28 You have the causality and consequences reversed. Brutal dictatorships are funded and buoyed by their oil wealth. It allows tyrants to keep people pacified without forcing them to invest in education, entrepreneurship, innovation. Kind of like social welfare programs can pacify.
3756 2018-10-25 16:42:01 . Ghosts  are allergic to anointing oil Gracious...

3758 2018-10-25 16:41:52 They have the same ingredients certainly. ALL mayos are an emulsion of oil, eggs, and some sort of acid. Then you add ingredients for flavor. Strictly speaking, aioli is also mayonaise. frites sauce (Dutch french fry mayo) as well as is miracle whip.

3761 2018-10-25 16:41:20 And the fact that you regurgitate the propaganda from this 3 piece smear stunt speaks volumes about your editorial agenda. History will show that the White Helmets et al are terrorists employed by the West for overthrowing secular Syria for the sheer greed of oil.
3762 2018-10-25 16:41:16 I’ve found that CBD Oil helps me a lot. Haven’t tried any Kava products though. I’ll give em a try.
3763 2018-10-25 16:41:02 Looks like toxins in disguise. Starch fried in seed oil = toxins.
3764 2018-10-25 16:40:54 I frankly don't give a shit how much oil we get from Saudi Arabia. They have admitted to state sanctioned, premeditated murder of a dissident. They deserve to be harshly sanctioned and punished from all corners.

3767 2018-10-25 16:40:49 Ask the doctors if a natural blood thinner such as dark chocolate or fish oil might be helpful.  There is a really good recipe for sugar free, grain free dark chocolate tarts on YouTube. My diabetic mother loved it.
3768 2018-10-25 16:40:44 I was literally so tired today that I thought to myself “does my car really need this oil change?”

3772 2018-10-25 16:40:25 It isn’t a win for the US. Germany’s bet is there’s no scarcity ex-Saudi & ex-Russia. It’s a smart bet - proven global reserves absent those 2 have risen tremendously in last 8 yrs...most notably Bahrain discovery. Oil prices are about to plummet again.

3791 2018-10-25 16:38:29 Yo @Ford @FordMustang just wanna let you guys know that @plantationford is purposely messing up peoples cars during oil changes. My car was totally fine, take it in for an oil change, come out with a $2000 evaporator AC issue. Took to another mechanic, all it needed was Freon.

3794 2018-10-25 16:38:00 Mimi Walters has been in the pocket of Big Oil for years! Her campaign received thousands from Big Oil, she signed a letter supporting offshore oil drilling, and opposed legislation that could stop climate change. Vote her out!

3797 2018-10-25 16:37:32 Damn that sucks, but if you have transportation systems run on oil/gas, just to get past the oil lobby, that could work. Then later we could retrofit them with electric motors and batteries, when oil inevitably becomes more expensive.
3798 2018-10-25 16:37:30 Ight y'll let's get this......
- pre heat oven for 375° 
- mix the flour, yeast, sugar, salt, oil, and water until it's smooth
- shape the dough so it fits the pan
- bake for 30-35 mins. Or until golden brown.
- let it cool and then enjoy

3808 2018-10-25 16:36:49 The way some greens are gearing up to oppose a carbon tax because doesn’t outlaw all fossil energy production and throw oil executives into jail is, uh, something to behold.
3809 2018-10-25 16:36:39 I thought it was on behalf of oil, which we don't need, or shouldn't want to have out of the ground at all. Or keeping Iran/Turkey south of Russia... Or blow up the national deficit even more?  Arms sales will cure it?  Bolton's Weltanschaung?

3959 2018-10-25 16:21:54 WD40 is a marvelous product but NEVER use it to lubricate a clock mechanism as it will gum it up over time.
Only use a synthetic oil to lubricate clocks.
3960 2018-10-25 16:21:44 America has; invaded multiple nations for OIL, interfered in elections, financed revolutions, supported oppressive regimes, murdered civilians, assassinated heads of state & used the military as mercenaries!

4001 2018-10-25 16:16:45 1) What kind of lazy people are we to have a national crisis over cooking oil, peanut butter, juices, products so easy to manufacture? What kind of lazy pple are we, when we fail to produce Soya Beans and SunFlower, both easy crops to grow? Are we not just a bunch of lazy people?
4002 2018-10-25 16:16:37 PSA: you can also order your own cbd only seed strains, grow them, and make the oil yourself for pennies on the dollar just by slowcooking your flower in coconut oil and straining out the plant stuff.

4095 2018-10-25 16:08:47 I think the theory goes that if you do believe that climate change is indeed on the verge of causing catastrophic irreversible effects as the scientists and IPCC say, then why are YOU supporting the oil industry!?
4096 2018-10-25 16:08:44 scopes are bulshit, stars however are alive, feeding on H-atoms or oil an H20 if they created a planet correctly. and filling the universe with electromagnetic radiation so the universe or this galaxy can be alive and electrically fuck with your head or spark methane under a bush
4097 2018-10-25 16:08:40 A Thing that troubles my mind today, by Lauren.
My interests in life do not accurately reflect the opportunities life will give me. That means being a woman in a world that still has to be told equality matters and being an artsy type living in a city obsessed with oil money.

#SaudiArabia sells us oil, while throwing gay people off of rooftops.

#Liberals silent.

1997-2000  
Saudi Arabia prohibits women from voting, driving, and not being the property of men.

Liberals silent.

2001
Saudi Arabia sends most of the terrorists of 9/11.
4099 2018-10-25 16:08:22 Are you say use of oil for energy is the invention or the genarator is.
4100 2018-10-25 16:08:14 Okay, this sounds interesting, so I’ll bite: I have this really great thick Shea butter/coconut oil mix I got from Aldi’s in my neighborhood. Adding it to the standard scented Shea butter I got at the local flea market. Moon is in Gemini.
4101 2018-10-25 16:08:13 If not believing in scientific scams and actually reading the IPCC AR5 is ignorance, so be it.  I refuse to join the foil hatted denial brigade n their oil funded soundbites.
4102 2018-10-25 16:08:11 Thanks Ken.Those are the kind of practical solutions we can all benefit from and they are easy to implement. As well,making sure we maintain our vehicle:proper tire air pressure and oil changes can go long way in reducing emissions while we wait for vehicles to be more affordable
4103 2018-10-25 16:08:06 Now you just need garlic, olive oil, a few anchovies, red pepper flakes and fresh fettucine.
4104 2018-10-25 16:07:43 There is no mild When it comes to racism
4105 2018-10-25 16:07:39 To take that thought further read a book like Michele Boldrin's Against Intellectual Monopoly or read Donald Trump's tweets which take for granted Microsoft's right to charge what it likes for Windows but questions the Arabs' right to charge a price for their main asset, oil.

4108 2018-10-25 16:07:24 We're sorry to hear of your disappointment Elizabeth, Some of the products within our range use palm oil within their recipe.  The amount of palm oil used in each product is currently less than 6%. 1/2
4109 2018-10-25 16:07:06 It sucks because there’s so many places they could’ve held the show. I’m guessing the biggest factor is they probably spent that oil money for Brock to get him to do the show and on HBK.

4128 2018-10-25 16:05:32 What happens when you remove government support for oil and don’t bail out automakers like GM during recessions? ICE gets are more suport and I haven’t even mentioned the true cost of their emissions.
4129 2018-10-25 16:05:24 This right here is why our Republican representatives never speak up against trump. They are able to do their dirty work while he causes chaos.

"The Trump administration just approved a plan to drill for oil in Alaska’s federal waters. It’s a major first."
4130 2018-10-25 16:05:20 Leet's not forget big oil subsidies on TOP of tax breaks. Corporations have no problem with accepting txpayer money but balk at things like higher min wages, price on pollution , etc
4131 2018-10-25 16:05:14 I'm teaching myself about economics. I asked myself if a country is sanctioned, can that country give at no cost its oil to another country.  No trade, just give them a ship of oil.

4135 2018-10-25 16:04:55 ..then what policies WOULD you support? EV incentives? Charging stations everywhere? Bike and transit investments? Regulations to curtail emissions from oil rigs? Energy efficiency upgrade funding for homes/biz?

All are good policies - but cost more than a carbon tax.

4168 2018-10-25 16:00:51 the only way to get subsidies of electricity, and rationing of GHG, is by taking control back from the oil companies. the only way to get back control, is by disbanding an oil company. an oil company can be disbanded without full control of government, so it is the first step.

4234 2018-10-25 15:55:17 Salmon roe is 40% omega-3 in phospholipid form, which is better absorbed, and has astaxanthins as well. Otherwise krill oil is great as well.
4235 2018-10-25 15:55:16 Everytime I try to give Popeyes a chance I actually get sick the oil ohhhh myyyyyyyy
4236 2018-10-25 15:55:13 An essential Oil!!!!

4239 2018-10-25 15:54:33 A kid hugged me this morning and said I smell like coffee and cake. Coffee because obvious and probably cake because of vanilla oil. Given allllll the weird things elementary kids could say, I think I feel pretty okay about that.
4240 2018-10-25 15:54:30 So as the economy was raised and best ever been....why Obama want credit for it?? 

Now it’s “plummeting”. IT WAS HIGHEST EVER. Gas is going up likely cuz of Saudi Arabia . We are still depending on foreign oil. He JUST announced new tax cuts.
4241 2018-10-25 15:54:26 Speaking of Whole Foods I need to go buy some more coconut oil
4242 2018-10-25 15:54:25 No-one goes into oil wells. Your whole thing is ignorance and agitprop!

4247 2018-10-25 15:54:03 rosehip oil in the morning, and argan oil at night! you can also use them for your hair and body. i got mine on amazon i think from the artnaturals line!
4248 2018-10-25 15:53:57 McDonald's has - repeatedly, offered ways to have the LEAST APPEALING portion of the menu purchased by those who avoid those items. The bread - for example, isn't as appealing as what the bread HOLDS - while "soaking-up" the amount of oil, & liquid "juice"...
4249 2018-10-25 15:53:50 I was going to say the same thing. If you consider purchasing a barrel of oil as an investment it fits all the same criteria.
4250 2018-10-25 15:53:49 Hidrasi nya yg bener bosque. Kalo muka ngerasa cukup sama hidrasi nya, otomatis kulit bawah kaya 'oh si kulit atas gaperlu dikasih minyak nih, udah cukup' otomatis nanti jadi ga minyakan. Kemaren sempet pake face oil sih, lumayan gak kilang banget
4251 2018-10-25 15:53:49 If there's anything that stresses me out the most in life even more than TJ, it's fuckung car problems!  AND I KNO I NEED AN OIL CHANGE OK
4252 2018-10-25 15:53:46 ladies this is a reminder to check your oil!!
4253 2018-10-25 15:53:46 @RachelNotley Irresponsible to allow the US to Steal our oil at cheap prices. Government must fix export prices to ensure FAIR trading and not allow the US to fix a low price. USE their lumber argument, albeit it is simply wrong to allow this theft of natural resources.
4254 2018-10-25 15:53:42 Just pour hella oil in the pan and drop in the mix lmao

4263 2018-10-25 15:53:01 Where did Kano State government get money for contracts?
Answer: From Federal Allocations
Where does the bulk of Federal Allocations come from?
Answer: Crude oil sales.
Where does Nigeria get its crude oil?
Answer: The Niger-Delta.
Hope the short lecture helped clear up the fog.

4266 2018-10-25 15:52:47 While you are denying them their rights in terms of financial grants. You even lied about your promise to give oil royalties to them. What can they build their states on then? But penang, get full federal support. Lets see how penang do the 47b ptmp without federal money.

4270 2018-10-25 15:52:12 I just got to this bit in the game today, haha. I’m finding it so hard to take the quest seriously. Gotta collect some oil for Testikles. Oil. For. Testikles. Assassin’s Creed, everybody!
4271 2018-10-25 15:52:08 This is the one of two parts of the problem. It has to get cheaper for people to even consider it. Then there's politics + highly influential people owners of the worlds oil companies that don't want it to happen

4275 2018-10-25 15:51:53 Exercise is good for a lifetime and can be done at home for free.  Like oil changes though, most people don't do it at home.
4276 2018-10-25 15:51:48 Ohio lawmakers were supposed to have a policy in effect September 18.  Now they have banned CBD oil, all while Montgomery county has the highest per capita overdose rate in the country.  #shamebigpharma.   People need help, and it starts with medical/recreation legalization

4286 2018-10-25 15:50:30 Solving oil dependency is difficult, requires technical knowledge and skill.
Punishing oil dependency is easy, requires political connections and power.
You have none of the former requirements, lots of latter. So, you choose to exploit Canadians' need to heat homes and drive.
4287 2018-10-25 15:50:28 Ontario should try and find oil again!
4288 2018-10-25 15:50:25 Hi I want you to buy back the oil property I bought and contract with shell and I'll get twenty five percent. I also have a patent for oil which I charge fifty percent for in your own country#syria
4289 2018-10-25 15:50:18 On 24 Mar 99, NATO, led by the United States, launched the two-month bombardment of Yugoslavia.  The strikes were not limited to military installations and included civilian targets such as factories, oil refineries, television stations and various infrastructure. #Clinton

4293 2018-10-25 15:49:50 No because even though it’s not hot the engine can run hot and burn your oil. It will also affect you as it gets colder. Quick fix just see which anti-freeze/coolant to use. You got this.

4296 2018-10-25 15:49:30 Beware of fake or substandard motor oil. It will kill your engine. For clarity on choice of engine oil,talk to me.@connectibadan
4297 2018-10-25 15:49:30 @MrReinhart_Tech @STEM_Race this is a great activity for students to understand oil temps and viscosity.
4298 2018-10-25 15:49:28 Strange, given we've all lost our minds, how nice it is here then. Not many murders, almost no mass murders/domestic terrorism, healthy and happy, well-educated, relatively low amounts of poverty, green & ecologically sustainable, lessening dependence on oil. Damn progressives!
4299 2018-10-25 15:49:25 Had a wonderful day delivering finished works, three loose sketches on paper and one formal oil on canvas portrait. Many thanks to a the humans for their support and to all my subjects for extra cuddles today

4310 2018-10-25 15:48:39 Ddnt know he has some oil

4319 2018-10-25 15:48:06 If you have a non stick grill, it works without, but I suggest 1 tsp ghee. It's good. You always need a little bit oil/ghee.
4320 2018-10-25 15:48:06 Dunno if it counts but I once had a dirty martini made with Gordon’s, shaken with the garlic and herb oil (yes, oil. Yes, shaken) from the olives. It was viscous.
4321 2018-10-25 15:48:05 そんなこというのやめてくださいよ！！！！！？？？？？アロンソくんと僕が泣いちゃう。。。。。。
4322 2018-10-25 15:47:54 I also found that baking soda works magic!! If you lay the clothing down and just put some baking soda on it and a little water and scrub it with your finger and let it sit for a few hours, then wash and it came right out for me! Chapstick, pet urine, cooking oil, etc!
4323 2018-10-25 15:47:50 Ok, so we have the concept of mud wrestling Shiro, but what about ancient Olympic wrestler Shiro at a time where every participant had to be naked and covered in olive oil
4324 2018-10-25 15:47:50 Immigration usually happens because of a changing environment back home or change in stability of governments.  Since the U.S has signed backdoor oil deals with corporations which fucked up the climate in the refugees' origin countries, we brought the migrant crisis on ourselves.

4330 2018-10-25 15:47:01 I’m of the opinion that the world’s oil supplies will continue to be used, regardless of the consequences, because it makes people filthy rich. Until oil isn’t worth a dime, we’ll use it exclusively.
4331 2018-10-25 15:46:54 All my clothes smell like black & mild, incense and coconut oil. You’d think I fuck with somebody 94’ Caddy driving uncle
4332 2018-10-25 15:46:50 aye castor oil on edges really do work
4333 2018-10-25 15:46:50 yeah it was everywhere for like three months in the summer-fall of '08, and then completely evaporated

it looks between the price of oil collapsing in the recession and all the fracking infrastructure that went up in those years all the attention switched to natural gas ):
4334 2018-10-25 15:46:48 You played yourself
4335 2018-10-25 15:46:44 Selfish, as I will profit from the need for #LITHIUM and other while at the same time profit from oil remaining in demand.

4354 2018-10-25 15:44:52 hey if you keep up this stealth tracking stuff OOTT group will get co-opted by either the Saudis, Iran or some US based oil group .... so they get the figure exactly the way they want, instead of based on the data as captured by your analysis
4355 2018-10-25 15:44:33 Hahaha. I'm alive and it's really not very different from regular noodles. Just the sauce is oil based and there's this miserable chunks that they shouldn't have bothered with.

Buhari came few months later and retained Emefiele, a Delta born Christian yet that Buhari is vengeful.

The BADDEST TWEETS I saw in the last 10years. Davido was 13 when I joined Twitter, now he can't deal with a simple tweet. #Omoradarada. I hope Imade and Victoria never have a man tweet them to oil their pussy and that it's rusty down there.

“You also need your oil changed, 2 tires replaced, and your valve gasket cover has a leak and needs to be replaced “
Considering they quoted me $1000 just for the valve gasket cover, I think I’m just gonna buy a bike

4382 2018-10-25 15:41:35 Well, if he tries to involve the military they will just ignore him because he's that retarded, to keep giving them money in exchange for nothing. And they are too busy protecting oil abroad and mis spending money in friends weapon companies to actually do their job

4384 2018-10-25 15:41:33 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
4385 2018-10-25 15:41:33 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4387 2018-10-25 15:41:17 @realDonaldTrump when we push and say no exemption, a new game is set up to move people's attention to the other. I swear to God that all this is to boycott oil, such as the Russian case that pressured the tramp to surrender to the agreement.
4388 2018-10-25 15:41:12 Cooking oil yechii
4389 2018-10-25 15:41:09 Bra I gotta see how this man act off the oil

4393 2018-10-25 15:40:49 @realDonaldTrump What's struggling with me is that Tramp does not believe my words, I say anything with thought and precision. All of these games are Saudi records, bombings are all games that throw Hawas Trump out of the oil embargo
4394 2018-10-25 15:40:48 Little bit of oil, little lawrys, got yourself some baked goodness
4395 2018-10-25 15:40:46 midas screwed up my oil change and I'm making madi call and bitch so they'll give me a refund... will I ever learn how to adult
4396 2018-10-25 15:40:41 Husky CEO describes Canada's oil price problem, due to full pipes, thusly: "the slowest train crash ever seen. 10 yrs out you could see it coming and we walked into it as a nation"
4397 2018-10-25 15:40:37 @DiscoStew66 Palm oil? I've read otherwise because of deforestation.
4398 2018-10-25 15:40:35 Just learned why Poppaduklis (sp) was Obumba went after him.  Pop. was helping Israel get oil into the country.  Obviously Obumba being a Muslim or past Muslim did not like Israel getting Oil.

4401 2018-10-25 15:40:15 Went to get an oil change @pepboysauto & he asked what kind of oil, I said I honestly don’t know what I usually get. He said okay & after the car was ready he hits me with the total of $65.10! My oil changes are not more than maybe $35! Taking advantage bc idk about oil. Low lol.
4402 2018-10-25 15:40:14 I literally have 100$ to last me until next Thursday, but I have to spend 50$ on an oil change, put some money towards gas & then I’m hungry so we know how that goes

4408 2018-10-25 15:40:04 How’d you grill it without oil?
4409 2018-10-25 15:40:02 getting my oil change I hope it don’t be to long
4410 2018-10-25 15:39:59 Just curious if you have tried CBD oil before or if you ve been thinking about it?
4411 2018-10-25 15:39:58 That is EXACTLY what the people of Venezuela said. Not they are starving, jailed and killed.
And they no longer have a country. RU owns their oil and them.

4413 2018-10-25 15:39:19 Crude oil can be separated into its fractions by fractional distillation. Long chain fractions are in less demand, are darker in colour, harder to ignite, they burn with a smokier flame and are more viscous (don’t flow as easily). Short ones are the opposite! #GCSEs2019 #mocks

4415 2018-10-25 15:38:57 Sorry to hear that. CBD oil really helps me. Recommend it to everyone. Try to find a good quality full spectrum hemp extract, organic ideally as hemp absorbs everything it is grown in. Much love to you.

4417 2018-10-25 15:38:47 Every so often (and quite often lately), a new health marketing gimmick comes along. Right now, it’s keto, kale, avocados, coconut oil, and anything grass fed. Years ago, it was anything raw vegan. It’s also been fish oil, flax oil, whey protein, and so on. Don’t fall for it!
4418 2018-10-25 15:38:47 the irony would be u go clean power while u supply rest of canada with dirty oil ?

4420 2018-10-25 15:38:37 For soup, cook cubed garlic in oil, then simmer with turkey, cilantro, vegetable broth and mushrooms. Top with scallions.
4421 2018-10-25 15:38:28 This administration never tell Nigerians that oil price has risen, your govt is elected to fix the country not continuing telling us about the past admin. During your tenure as the head of state Nigeria didn't have steady power supply nor good schools. What's changes?
4422 2018-10-25 15:38:20 World think Saudi rich - yes, they're rich in oil, etc.  Only ppl with $s is Royal family.  Ppl I know going to Saudi on contracts say the Saudi ppl who work are not being paid - no $s to pay them.  Prince wants tourist city built to bring in tourist - for what?
4423 2018-10-25 15:38:10 Magnemite, the Sharp Claw Pokémon is oil wrestling.
4424 2018-10-25 15:37:56 I have free lifetime oil changes thru my dealership, thanks though!
4425 2018-10-25 15:37:54 Everyone remember when Larry Kudlow said invading Iraq would bring the world $20 a barrel oil? Kudlow is a coke-head bullshit artist whose bullshit is not that artful.

4427 2018-10-25 15:37:37 A pair of mechanics overalls or denim dungarees, converse high tops and a red neckerchief tying your hair up, holding a spanner, with a bit of engine oil on your cheek. Bit like kylie/Charlene in neighbours back in the 80s. Bit specific but you did ask 
4428 2018-10-25 15:37:35 @anchorup5 Hey, awesome that you're in the CBD oil business. I'm following you now.

4432 2018-10-25 15:37:18 it's good!! a fav of mine is asparagus and mushrooms. does take a while to cook so just gotta make sure you oil em up good so they don't dry out. and for potatoes and other thick stuff just cut them up
4433 2018-10-25 15:37:17 ラスボスは金玉
4434 2018-10-25 15:36:45 You don’t have much heavy oil or potash or copper or zinc or _____.  You cannot just make this stuff out of thin air.  You need to buy it from countries who have it.  Wake up!!!
4435 2018-10-25 15:36:32 Your jealousy of my beautiful, smart, inclusive country is showing. Now behave yourself or we'll cut off your oil.
4436 2018-10-25 15:36:27 หน้าเหมือนแม่มากเลยค่ะ

4441 2018-10-25 15:35:47 #Khashoggi lack of UK and US action is not all about weapons sales, it's about oil, we stop selling them weapons and they reduce oil production, that cripples any countries economy, sooner the oil runs dry the sooner countries like Saudi Arabia lose their grip on the world
4442 2018-10-25 15:35:45 The trolls 4 years ago were deramping by saying big oil in place but not one drop would come to surface, now we find the Kim is one BIG connected system and oil exploding to the surface, I can see this going nuts very soon.  #ukog
4443 2018-10-25 15:35:43 There are concerns about oil filters, I would generally suggesting swapping filters at 5K miles if you’re doing a 10K interval. Diesel engines are an entirely different thing which I have less experience with.
4444 2018-10-25 15:35:41 @HairyReed Illegals in caravan having time of their lives. Trump will not relocate them to Alutian Islands owned by Russia, no way. But Russian needs them to populate desolate places. Fish, and work in oil patch.
4445 2018-10-25 15:35:41 good night。。。！

4448 2018-10-25 15:35:26 Your infernal Grace: As one of your regional Governors, I have taken the liberty of banning vodka and tequila in my region. As per a memo I sent via tarantula mail, cod liver oil now flows freely for all "residents" to enjoy.
Infernally yours.....
4449 2018-10-25 15:35:21 Ok. Try cut the meat into very tiny pieces wey e go hard make them separate am from the food. You fit try sardine. Mix ein then the oil all plus the food thoroughly see.
4450 2018-10-25 15:35:16 @OriginalCakeCo Surprised to see Palm Oil in some of your cakes :-(
4451 2018-10-25 15:35:06 Just like the Russian oil execs feel about Trump.

4458 2018-10-25 15:34:33 Having done used oil analysis for in-suspension modifiers (TBNs), for most non-turbo engines it seems like a modern synthetic will do you for 10K miles, perhaps a bit more.

Turbo engines seem to have more oil shear, I wouldn’t run them longer than 7.5K miles at the most.

4461 2018-10-25 15:34:21 I actually use @DawnDish soap because of those cute commercials with the oil coated ducks getting cleaned. I don’t really know if I’m helping ducks but it makes me feel good. Yay ducks! #imissemilioestevez
4462 2018-10-25 15:34:20 @amazonIN always suspected u were re-selling used books. recvd a sheryl sandberg book wid dirt n oil stains & paper I don't want 2 touch
4463 2018-10-25 15:34:11 We are actually trying to wean ourselves off oil, or have you missed that?
4464 2018-10-25 15:33:58 Fun fact: the smartest people I’ve ever met always have grease & oil from fingertips to forearms.
4465 2018-10-25 15:33:46 If the USA keeps on the tariff path, then the lifestyle most citizens lead will be impossible 2 maintain...don’t follow a moron off the cliff...maybe take an economics course online!

U need heavy oil...u need lumber...u need potash (where are you going 2 mine potash in the USA?)
4466 2018-10-25 15:33:33 In East Rajasthan, there is a request from people who have no entry to the Congress. Please do not waste your oil and time in the faucet!

4471 2018-10-25 15:33:17 My advise is don't download Uncle Freds book like that, na Ojukwu friend, one of the most balanced books on Nigerian history and the war ive read till date is Oil, Politics and Violence by Max Siollun.
4472 2018-10-25 15:33:12 I didn't say I choose Buhari but if I were to choose Buhari, atleast he's preparing a future out of oil
4473 2018-10-25 15:32:56 Indian economy has to forget unemployment, NPA & Financial frauds/scams as country is facing more grave macroeconomic imbalance by way of Oil price mismanagement, Rupee $ parity mismanagement and contagion effect of ILFS mismanagement. Save the nation from nationalists of today.
4474 2018-10-25 15:32:55 How amazed were you to hear that horrible little oil, Green turned out to be the person trying to keep his name undercover...how low can this piece of scum actually go?

4476 2018-10-25 15:32:51 Need to check the oil at the next stop.
4477 2018-10-25 15:32:51 happy family time papa
4478 2018-10-25 15:32:39 put more peppermint oil
4479 2018-10-25 15:32:38 Oil Can Boyd begs to differ
4480 2018-10-25 15:31:41 I need a husband like my momma that takes my car to get the oil changed  this baby SUV cost more than $30 whheeeww child
4481 2018-10-25 15:31:37 Yeah, he kind of fucked over the town that he claimed his ark would bring people to. Nothing but a snake oil salesman.
4482 2018-10-25 15:31:23 ZZ19 is still the spread to keep an eye on in Crude Oil. 2.95 is the most traded price area of that spread. Currently at 3.02
4483 2018-10-25 15:31:18 “Intimidation” so now Big Oil is claiming to be some scared victim, afraid of mean words?
4484 2018-10-25 15:31:15 actually, fortunately a minority Government cannot change primary legislation without the support of other parties in Parliament. Independence has no bearing on the matter now that onshore oil and gas licensing powers are devolved to Holyrood.
4485 2018-10-25 15:31:14 Like let me vote of 30 different things instead of bundling big oil with vaping???? Where is the logic???
4486 2018-10-25 15:31:09 I was hoping for a little more pain heading into Black Friday. I figured another 3-5% down, then 10% up by end of year and I'm doing 2x for 2018. Then should be a decent 2019. Not sure it'll happen. Thinking of getting back into some oil stocks I got out of in June....price + div
4487 2018-10-25 15:31:01 I literally use mayonnaise.... or you can do eggs and coconut oil.
4488 2018-10-25 15:30:59 Alaskans own 34,236 shares of MAIRE TECNIMONT SPA, worth $128,160. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in ITALY.

4499 2018-10-25 15:29:56 You should care...the USA needs Canadian heavy oil and potash and soft wood lumber and __ or prices will skyrocket so many people will not be able to afford things.  The USA is a “service” economy.  Your country has been built to import some resources and some manufactured goods.
4500 2018-10-25 15:29:51 What’s the issue? Are you referring to oil high and yet indices are high?

4513 2018-10-25 15:28:38 US oil imports and exports are fairly balanced, so I don’t think China reducing oil imports will hurt the US overall. Any harm it does to US shale oil producers will be offset by the benefit to US oil consumers. Definitely hurts OPEC and Russia, though.

4515 2018-10-25 15:28:33 I am Mexican and I applaud @VicenteFoxQue, his legislations are the ones that keep México from depending on oil. Thanks to the SAPI reform, investment in Mexico increased like never before. The ones that hate him are similar to a lot of Trump supporters, haters.

Check the people that constitute PDP are all heartless looters. We are not just looking at Atiku alone but the people he is workin with.

4526 2018-10-25 15:26:58 I think the root of the problem is US oil dependency. Anyone discussing that?
4527 2018-10-25 15:26:49 One would think that an oil producing nation will make it priority to refine their own oil
4528 2018-10-25 15:26:45 Lol u think so? Ofc I have. From every region of Italy, Croatia,  Spain, Tunisia... they are all good but nothing comes close to Greek (Crete) and Cyprus olives & olive oil. Sorry I'm not biased

But I guess I put too much oil in it & that’s just as bad... who knew, which one is it, do you want me to put oil in the car or blow the fucking engine.

4596 2018-10-25 15:19:38 So for your mind, recession occur in just 6 months abi? FYI, the recession of 2016 started booting in 2014, and became inevitable in 2015. It was even a surprise it didn't happen before the end of 2015. So before you cry recession, ask the PDP what they did with excess oil money.
4597 2018-10-25 15:19:30 Unfortunately, we don’t refine our oil. If we did, price would be very stable. The sellers of diesel buy at the market prices of crude oil and then resell refined products to us

4653 2018-10-25 15:14:00 Nice to see OIL over $67.  Very good level for the many companies, employees, and secondary merchants to make some good money!  WTI is sweet

4657 2018-10-25 15:13:39 Correct, & agreed  See if you can spot the inconsistency in the logic of most economists below:

-Producing more of our own oil = +
-Producing more of our own rare earths = +
-Producing more of our own everything else (cutting "free trade deals") = Disaster
4658 2018-10-25 15:13:30 Saudi Arabia said on Thursday the oil market could be shifting towards oversupply in the fourth quarter of the year as oil inventories rise and demand slows, and the top oil exporter will "mirror" such changes in its production.

4672 2018-10-25 15:11:48 It’s symbiotic with everything that lives.  I known it sounds total hippy Shangri-la but I absolutely believe it will save the planet from us.  It can do everything oil can but in a completely environmentally  sustainable way.

4680 2018-10-25 15:10:55  peppermint oil helps with the pain, but don’t use too much or you’ll get a burn from the oil. Orajel also. There’s also a couple clinics around here that don’t charge as much as a dentist would. I know this feel, I drained my savings with my wisdom teeth. Love you.

4708 2018-10-25 15:07:41 She's lovely! I asked about breed because some don't do well with smells. Goldie/Collie should be ok. Just make the oil vety lightly scented. You could also see if she would take some chamomile tea. Mixed with her dinner.(If she's eating. Hope she doesn't get that upset.)
4709 2018-10-25 15:07:39 Mix Gari with palm oil and add meat. Otherwise you’ll end up buying them the bagged foods like me when I want to make them feel special, even that, they won’t eat it without meat

4789 2018-10-25 15:01:09 So, the question is, if we cut off Saudi Oil by an act of parliament, what do we use until our own system has been retrofitted? I would love to see us weaned off fossil fuels altogether, but it can't happen overnight. That process should have begun in earnest about 20 years ago.
4790 2018-10-25 15:00:58 Happy Birday @Limoblaze, more Oil for ministry
4791 2018-10-25 15:00:54 it has never been free- the government has been collecting taxes on fuel and energy sales for decades - my hydro is taxed as is my natural gas,  gas and diesel is taxed twice ... now tax it all again while touting a larger pipeline to sell more oil

4802 2018-10-25 15:00:12 overdue for me... matter of fact i dont change my oil i let the shit burn through the turbo and just top that bitch up a lil when the light comes on when i hit the brakes hard.
4803 2018-10-25 15:00:05 I BET A DOLPHIN COULDN'T EVEN DO ROUTINE MAINTENANCE ON A BUS. HOW IS A BUS GOING TO GET ITS OIL CHANGED WITH A DOLPHIN IN CHARGE. !!!!!!
4804 2018-10-25 14:59:46 Don do the right thing America is first loosen up oil restrictions but if they did this you need to make a statement
4805 2018-10-25 14:59:28 Also CBD oil is great for pain! Not to Get stoned
4806 2018-10-25 14:59:20 To firm breasts and tighten the skin, mix one teaspoon of vitamin E oil with one tablespoon of yogurt and an egg.
4807 2018-10-25 14:59:18 Doh! Some miserable sod has sneaked up and swapped all the oil in my car engine for mayonnaise...
4808 2018-10-25 14:59:08 They could, theoretically. Except, we don't have any refineries to refine the kind of oil that comes out of the ground in Alberta, or any way to get the oil to a refinery that could, again theoretically, be retooled to refine it. It would take 2 years to build the pipeline...
4809 2018-10-25 14:59:06 Read a series of tweets with interest. It seems to me that if your argument about XRP were right oil would also meet all the four criteria. Can you explain which of four criteria oil does not satisfy?
4810 2018-10-25 14:58:56 Amber oil in my diffuser has my classroom smelling like heaven.
4811 2018-10-25 14:58:55 American “cheese” isn’t cheese at all. It’s vegetable oil.
4812 2018-10-25 14:58:53 This time I bought the big bottle of Buckley's. It is more disgusting than the cod liver oil I used to have to take by the spoonful, I think.
4813 2018-10-25 14:58:53 Natrep, biore cleansing oil
4814 2018-10-25 14:58:49 I hope this don’t take long. It’s weird having someone else do your oil changes when your use to doing them yourself.
4815 2018-10-25 14:58:44 Come over here & supply us with cash fuel, cooking oil & jobs. You're the most useless product of the Zim curriculum. An Ediot who skipped UZ so he can go & sprout nonsense from Kwazulu. These are the results of smoking & drinking during pregnancy. Your mum should've known better
4816 2018-10-25 14:58:43 Hopefully we have moved on from oil and gas and like the fishery need to prepare for this. Cleaner renewable sources are available even now

4819 2018-10-25 14:58:27 No one’s going to do well taking recipe advice from me, but I’m feeling great about my decision about 8 months ago to eliminate virtually all seed oils. Now I use a little olive oil or butter for cooking. What product are you referring to that used cottonseed oil?
4820 2018-10-25 14:58:22 Then you  should also go for taking oil.

4824 2018-10-25 14:58:09 I really like olive oil it works best for my hair. It keeps the moisture in pretty well
4825 2018-10-25 14:58:09 I’m at the dealership getting my first oil change.
4826 2018-10-25 14:57:43 I'm just wondering who would ever hire Sarah after she leaves the WH. Apparently she's not fully aware of how she herself  throws oil on the fire covering up lies with yet another lie or twisting the truth. Seems that she completely sold her soul.
4827 2018-10-25 14:57:39 Just got in , no heat, my heating oil provider @SouthernStates let me run out. I informed them last week I only had 21” left in a 275 tank. I am an automatic customer . Not supposed to run out.

4831 2018-10-25 14:57:19 Hi, Florence! This vintage piece seems to be from the '80s. Specifically a press release was found which says they started selling Skipjack Tuna in Brine with no added oil in 1982! That cupboard might be a time machine! Daaling
4832 2018-10-25 14:57:06 Cool- let’s remove oil subsidies.
4833 2018-10-25 14:57:01 But isnt it?  i bake them with a tablespoon of olive oil and sea salt so i think they are
4834 2018-10-25 14:56:58 Grilling aubergine with olive oil, s&p & mashed garlic before adding to a curry gives it a nice meaty, rich taste :). Also I'd recommend doing a creamy coconut milk curry with fresh ginger, black mustard seeds, chilli, turmeric, sweet potato, spinach & chic peas

4837 2018-10-25 14:56:48 You bitches are gonna make me have to grow a beard just to save the fate of masculinity. If you can’t change your oil or a flat tire, shave and get a bowl cut cuz you’re still a fuckin child.
4838 2018-10-25 14:56:40 They're not.  TWTR 280 characters limiting full delineation, which is this: Quorum of the world's biggest creditors and oil exporters have been buying and repatriating gold and selling USTs.  This has enormous implications over time
4839 2018-10-25 14:56:34 1. There is a Revenue shortfall in what was expected for the 2018 Budget. Especially as regards oil output (1.7m bps against expected 2m bpd).

2. But both Customs & FIRS have in last 2 yrs raised highest revenue in their history.

Don't mix up the two.
4840 2018-10-25 14:56:30 I’m the youngest person waiting to get their oil changed by a good 30 years
4841 2018-10-25 14:56:23 Maybe January (Pilot). But then there was the calendar song by The Trinidad Oil Company.
4842 2018-10-25 14:56:20 I like to sleep with olive oil in the root of my hair (the kind you cook with from the store) and then wake up and wash it out or you can create a protective style from it.
4843 2018-10-25 14:56:19 The pc govt was in power in Ab for 46 years. Oil was found at Turner Valley in 1936. It was the largest oil field in the British Empire. The PCs came to power in 1971. You should check facts before beaking off. Makes you look like an idiot.
4844 2018-10-25 14:56:16 Oil painting. — feeling determined
4845 2018-10-25 14:56:04 Bernie would prefer that our enemy Iran achieve hegemony in the region. 
Oil prices will skyrocket, Iran will get nukes, destroy Israel, and we'll get sucked into another war in the Middle East.

4848 2018-10-25 14:55:47 I refilled my diffuser first thing this morning. Why has it been two hours and I just realized that I didn’t put a single fucking drop of essential oil in it Lmfaooo

4851 2018-10-25 14:55:27 Is this what cooking oil is doing while its scarce? Like self-care?
4852 2018-10-25 14:55:23 Fascinating!  Rumor has it Russians drink olive oil just before drinking Americans under the table 
4853 2018-10-25 14:55:19 What you forgot to tweet about is the fact the British 'Empire' infact established the House of Saud Centuries ago to be their/our 'puppets'/friends in the Middle East... Since they discovered they were sitting on tonnes of oil, they worked out how to play the game in their favor
4854 2018-10-25 14:55:17 Pretty much meaningless. Fact 1. Saddam broke treaty after treaty and fired upon American planes. 
Fact 2. We received less oil from Iraq during and after the war.
Fact 3. America liberated Kuwait...also didn't "steal its oil."
4855 2018-10-25 14:55:17 kleveru oil, dulu cleanser viva, masker (produk yg sama cuma beda varian)

4857 2018-10-25 14:55:12 So now I’m in a shuttle on the way back to my house because whatvwas supposed to be a tire check and oil change on my car has turned into a full-blown ICU situation.

4860 2018-10-25 14:54:39 Dont fool the public the public.  Any increase which factory or shop have to pay .will ultimately go to lowest level of society. If production cost ghee/oil increase .will not be paid by pti gang but will go to every member.

4873 2018-10-25 14:53:38 Bottle of olive oil. Peel and halve the garlic cloves and post them into the bottle. It gets stronger the longer you leave it. Avoid breathing too close to anyone who's not had some.

4881 2018-10-25 14:52:35 I slap coconut oil on after my lotion (a step I can skip in summer). Sag.
4882 2018-10-25 14:52:34 Venezuela has nothing, their people are starving, the people in the pictures do not look starving, Venezuela has oil and lots of it. I think you've been misled by Honduras.
4883 2018-10-25 14:52:32 Still, I lost my oil. Crap
4884 2018-10-25 14:52:16 It's ok we make hundreds of millions in weed tax but still want more taxes for roads and schools. Plus we are pushing to eliminate oil which is a primary driver of our economy. The socialist wont impact much.....

4900 2018-10-25 14:50:49 I almost get the tobacco suits: company, knowing harm of product, sells product to unknowing consumer.  I don’t get the big oil suits: company sells fuel to transport customer without disclosing the harm that driving would cause to atmosphere.
4901 2018-10-25 14:50:41 Sweet rod oil? With it
4902 2018-10-25 14:50:41 Is this the BBC trying to put a new slant on misreporting by not saying how much oil is left but twisting it into how much its going to cost to extract.

4934 2018-10-25 14:47:15 Shell would be very, very well positioned in the Permian with the buy. Would give them over 500,000 acres, two basins and a deep inventory where they already buy most the crude oil.
4935 2018-10-25 14:47:06 I have one of those R2 charger things from ThinkGeek and I’m getting my oil changed and R2 turns on when you turn the car on and he scared the mechanic who was pulling my car into the shop and I’m dying 
4936 2018-10-25 14:47:01 What makes the olive oil extra virgin?
4937 2018-10-25 14:46:56 I have made multiple bad decisions in traffic this morning.  The "other route is faster" prompt is equivalent to a snake oil salesmen.  Like in life at times you need to just stay the course and ride it out.
4938 2018-10-25 14:46:53 whoops... copied oil inventory data by mistake... 1 sec.
4939 2018-10-25 14:46:43 TRUMP is a LIAR and thief,a man who has no soul,SATAN'S great deceiver who can steal unsuspecting souls who aren't aware of their ignorance to except lies as the truth.TRUMP the entertainer and snake oil salesman is a master of deception.follow him to your own demise or wake up.
4940 2018-10-25 14:46:14 ok...now we are getting somewhere...

so norway drills for, collects and sells oil.  the sale of that oil goes directly to the entire cost of supporting the public education.   

nothing in there suggests "free"     air is free.  no cost whatsoever.

public school is not free
4941 2018-10-25 14:46:02 Lol better get used
4942 2018-10-25 14:45:49 Consistent regimen, being as gentle as possible with my hair at all times,  low- manipulation styles, staying away from combs, moisturizing daily with water + olive oil.

4950 2018-10-25 14:44:50 Life appears better then because of the #FalseEconomy as a result of oil price. The false living standard you enjoyed at the time is why #PDP failed to complete infrastructural projects. Information provided are #Fact about the abysmal performance of the #PDP era.
4951 2018-10-25 14:44:39 That's the ice sorted, now we need an oil tanker full of gin...
4952 2018-10-25 14:44:38 Probably olive oil and some sort of aioli but I do that at home anyway
4953 2018-10-25 14:44:37 Between this and cod liver oil, not sure what’s worse?

4955 2018-10-25 14:44:28 Audi? That must have been just for on oil change...
4956 2018-10-25 14:44:12 I did and you never answered.

 Who SPECIFICALLY benefits from pro-environmental incentives and opposing the oil industry and how *specifically* do they benefit?
4957 2018-10-25 14:44:07 Gold stocks couldn't stop the bleeding when oil was $40. Now we are seeing the higher energy prices bite and there still hasn't been an adjustment in the gold price. $1400 gold wouldnt cover the rising energy cost.
4958 2018-10-25 14:43:52 Recipe? Umm, you mean I was supposed to keep track of what I put in the cake? 1 box @NamasteFoods Spice Cake mix, 4 eggs, ⅔ c oil ¾ c buttermilk, 4lb apples (mix of tart/sweet), lots of cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves. Make batter, put ¾ in pan, mix rest w/, spices, ½ brown sugar 1/

It was a breezy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  Botchlings. 'Use Cursed Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
4960 2018-10-25 14:43:29 Global oil price should climb exponentially

4961 2018-10-25 14:43:21 So @AJA_Cortes treated me to dinner at an awesome steakhouse last night. 

One thing I noticed was how simple the ingredients in our food were. 

Meat
Salt
Pepper
Butter
Broccoli 
Olive oil
Peppercorn

That was it.

4965 2018-10-25 14:42:50 I've asked this question a few times, but not had a reply yet. If someone uses the legally obtained CBD oil from health food stores on the high street, would they test positive on a drug wipe test? Would the oil strength change this result? Or time since taking? Or method of use?

4970 2018-10-25 14:42:30 Sorry but I disagree,westminster knows it cant beat snp fairly at ballot box so they will use Brexit to try to shut down scot parly.
These people went to war for oil,no way will they let scots vote and walk away with thiers.WM are not mature enough to do that

4972 2018-10-25 14:42:05 Oil companies are known 4 buying innovative ideas & burying them so they never get to market. If it's a patent File it as Patent Pending, my dad put a Patent on his and when it expired a conglomerate stole his idea and manufactured it. Be secretive & don't let that happen to you.

4979 2018-10-25 14:41:33 America has never received more the 4.5% of its oil from Iraq. After the Iraq war, America received even less. Today I believe it's at 2%. China, South Korea India, Italy receive the vast majority of Iraq's oil.
4980 2018-10-25 14:41:31 So John Brennan gets a bomb sent to him and @CNN. CNN then switches to him and now you and your Breitbart buddies decide to put more oil on the already fire of hatred towards them. Tres Chique.

4985 2018-10-25 14:41:11 It really wasn't. It was completely impartial, you just don't agree because you supported yes. It definitely won't be yes or no if it's ever rerun (certainly no time soon) the yes campaign was full of lies. It made up imaginary meetings with BOE and the EU. It lied about oil.
4986 2018-10-25 14:41:07 Nothing beats pasta a aglio e olio with a touch of fresh hot peppers and sardines fried with the oil and garlic. Especially at midnight!

5003 2018-10-25 14:39:47 #BLOE is a hidden gem in AIM. Just gotta let management do their thing. Also such ideal timing as well as the next few years will be a bull run for oil. Tensions between the GCC and USA could realistically push oil prices above £150 within a year
5004 2018-10-25 14:39:43 I watched the whole debate. Future Governor Gilium handled everything with dignity. I truly believe it is because of his grandmother's "blessed oil."
5005 2018-10-25 14:39:31 No oil...
5006 2018-10-25 14:39:31 WaPo had an article, 10/22, "For gulf oil spill, no end in sight." It's not on their website but said, since 2004 this sunken oil platform has been spilling oil! Taylor Energy denies it! No one plans to cap it! Ongoing disaster. Trump: let's expand oil drilling in the Gulf. Sigh!
5007 2018-10-25 14:39:24 新しい壊滅来たりした…？
5008 2018-10-25 14:39:24 what is "oil money"?  the taxes paid on oil?  or the sale of oil?
5009 2018-10-25 14:39:21 We're calling oil geopolitics now?
5010 2018-10-25 14:39:17 And You wont be Surprised that After All the Retoric .. OIL & Arms Money will win out in the End
5011 2018-10-25 14:39:06 Lol or coco milk, much much less oil
5012 2018-10-25 14:39:00 Of course Lagos and Ondo has oil too
5013 2018-10-25 14:38:59 And you always believed wrong. Faulty intelligence did occur, but what also occurred and seems forgotten was Iraq's constant breaking of treaties, flying into "no fly zones" and shooting at our planes. Reconstituted Iraqi gov't sold oil on the open market. China receives the bulk

5016 2018-10-25 14:38:43 The Saudi killing of this journalist rightly deserves to be condemned. However, as much as it may be distasteful, to alienate a country which has one fifth on the worlds oil reserves and favours the west as allies is problematic.

5030 2018-10-25 14:37:48 There will never be an earth-to-combustion engine oil movement for people driving to the artisanal butcher or the farm-to-table restaurant. “I want to know where my oil comes from and whether it’s Saudi or shale oil.”

5032 2018-10-25 14:37:23 Yeah, continue to throw oil on conspiracy theories. You should be ashamed.
5033 2018-10-25 14:37:22 DeSantis is absolutely correct! Gillum will "transform" Florida, slow down the economy & kill businesses with his 40% proposed tax increase! He smooth snake oil salesman, which we've seen before!
5034 2018-10-25 14:37:22 Right? From an environmental perspective & a business perspective, both, there are plenty of reasons to fix these problems. For example, Florida has a multi-billion dollar tourism industry that's drowning in red & brown tides - and oil slicks.
5035 2018-10-25 14:37:20 EU don't care about human right. They are eying the oil.

5044 2018-10-25 14:35:40 We must know that better briars are dried during years, to get better smokes, and in this process the wood looses his humidity, but his oils too. We don't wanna a so dried wood that burns under the sun, but if we bath our pipes in oil, maybe it borns a new branch on its.
5045 2018-10-25 14:35:31 US is third in oil production.

US is #1 in cutting CO2 emmisions.

It is high time we start being proud of our progress on both fronts, and continue making progress.
5046 2018-10-25 14:35:30 I don’t want to hear @JustinTrudeau talk about Saudi until he puts his words into action. Maybe now would be a good time to stop buying oil from a country that funds terrorism and crimes against humanity like Khashoggi. Time to put your words into action. @DaneLIoyd
5047 2018-10-25 14:35:26 You're not alone.  We have that where I work too.  We have a few instigators who start rumors.  All are over the age of 40. Where are the adults? Frustrating.  Know it's THEM. Not you.  Be the olive oil and let it slide off. Well,  at least try.  It's not easy.

5053 2018-10-25 14:34:56 Many people want to think if they don't understand a complex issue then those who claim to know more must be charlatans, a vested interest. The true rogues are those who sell the snake oil that complex problems have easy answers, hidden from ordinary people by the elite.
5054 2018-10-25 14:34:55 That burning sensation is common. I feel like my hips and ass are on fire almost daily. Some CBD oil infused cream is only helpful pain relief. Doctors never ask or understand about the burning.

5056 2018-10-25 14:34:32 @OnPointRadio Fracking wells' output falls rather precipitously, so the U.S. won't have oil dominance for very long.

5075 2018-10-25 14:32:08 Maybe you miss the point.  The relative value of a given oil and gas subsidy, from geology to well to refining to the cars gas tank is FAR bigger.  People whining about EV subsidies need to understand relative efficiency of gas vs electric.
5076 2018-10-25 14:32:02 Are they impacted or just coming in? When I had mine like last year and I couldn't take care of them right away I used clove oil. Pretty sure you can just go out and buy it and it's just a lil dropper you try and get in there and it'll numb the pain for most of the day.

5188 2018-10-25 14:20:52 High yielders outperforming, commodity exporters under-performing. Markets are trading a negative growth shock, so things like oil are down. I guess the price action is consistent with that theme.

5190 2018-10-25 14:20:48 Omission is regretted although oil refining is comatose in Nigeria right now. Oil marketers are also part of the value chain.

5212 2018-10-25 14:18:29 An adverse supply shock can only cause inflation if there is a significant contraction in output. All recent inflations have not been of this magnitude. The 70’s oil shock had no effect on inflation. Inflation is always more units of money used in the same number of transactions
5213 2018-10-25 14:18:29 Faulty Coolant pump caused constant engine overheating but no warning lights.   Oil boiled, causing low oil pressure, causing timing chain stretch, causing engine damage.  No real engine temp gauge so no way to know engine was in trouble until it's damaged.

5254 2018-10-25 14:14:14 I’d actually say there’s less variables in crypto in comparison to traditional trading, as we’re dealing with an uncorrelated asset, I.e. if I’m oil trading, I’m also watching inflation, USD etc. Way more to process.

Agree with everything else though.
5255 2018-10-25 14:14:12 Lol. No dispute that we have crude oil in all those states you mentioned and other states too but to say we have it abundance is an hyperbole.

Is just like saying Lagos has crude oil in abundance. They do have crude oil but not in abundance.

5266 2018-10-25 14:13:04 Yes. The oil industry. Exxon Mobile’s stock price depends on the mineral rights it owns. If they extract all that oil, it will be catastrophic. So they find denial and back right wing politicians. The Koch bros are in the oil biz. Putin’s Russia depends on oil exports.
5267 2018-10-25 14:13:02 After decades of flying Southwest Airlines, I finally purchased shares of the company...stock is down big today for little reason. The company reported a great quarter and lower oil prices will help increase future profits. Buy low, sell high. #LUV
5268 2018-10-25 14:12:55 A company that produces oil and flares gas.

Although there are now stiffer penalties for gas flaring and oil companies will have to monetize their gas production instead or risk hefty fines. Really hefty fines.

5307 2018-10-25 14:09:33 So tell me how collecting a tax, giving 90% of it back is going to help anything? This is ludicrous. If they took the tax and invested into research to be less dependant on oil, well maybe we could stomach it. But this is a tax grab plain and simple.

5351 2018-10-25 14:04:45 I’m half convinced the ID law was meant to keep the oil workers living in their cars in the Williston Walmart parking lot from voting and disenfranchising the tribes was just gravy.

5354 2018-10-25 14:04:34 @espodcast_eu episode 142, did I get it correctly, at first Aron says that all crazy beliefs and "paranoid conspiracy thinking" are all in one irrational category. Just to say that BIG OIL since 100 years ago conspired to kill electric car? any way, keep up the good job!

5361 2018-10-25 14:03:51 Socialism and communism survive through the use of capitalism. China a 3rd world nation until the introduction of capitalism. Norway survives with huge deposits of off shore oil traded within a capitalism system. Even Marx realized you can’t get to socialism without capitalism.

5375 2018-10-25 14:02:37 why would the author theorize on erasing debt so keenly? debt is a needed tool to develop the country anyways. we’re not like the saudis where they have excess income from oil.

5492 2018-10-25 13:51:25 in each of these transitions what we saw was growth of a market for which that fuel was suited.
Coal: industry
Oil: transport
Gas: heat 
So little actual transition from one source to another.
Exception is gas & nuclear in electricity but nothing on scale assumed for wind/solar.
5493 2018-10-25 13:51:21 I just want my oil changed...THATS IT 
5494 2018-10-25 13:51:19 Kasih bio oil buruuuu
5495 2018-10-25 13:51:17 What? The Notley govt is joined at the hip with the oil sands companies, who produce 80% of Alberta's crude oil. "Complete disregard" is hyperbole that is not supported by the evidence. Unless you have evidence the rest of us don't, which I doubt.
5496 2018-10-25 13:51:14 Couldn't agree more. @Adrianwfire why not show the people on LSE you're arguing with that you're the adult, stop the provocative tweets & carry on with the great work you've been doing to show Investors the potential the whole Weald offers?
5497 2018-10-25 13:51:11 jjsjdj I got burn with hot oil while cooking and it hurts like a mf even tho it's just a tiny lil spot what the hell
5498 2018-10-25 13:50:58 i had to change one of my headlights the other week and now the other one is out and i STILL need to get an oil change
5499 2018-10-25 13:50:54 See the opportunity, get the money
5500 2018-10-25 13:50:51 Remember the reality of how this works - Big Oil massive investment in these ads is less political in opposing a weak carbon fee they can happily live with but more managing public perception to think that 1631 is actually a real challenge to their power. #BrerRabbit #BriarPatch
5501 2018-10-25 13:50:49 The former  soviet officials have   I think promised our representatives money for their supporters and for our military too.  With tRUMP at the helm we're lost and it's a turkey shoot following big oil to the soviet camp.
5502 2018-10-25 13:50:47 CBD oil by the gallon perhaps.
5503 2018-10-25 13:50:37 yeah. coconut oil just doesn't do it for my hair

5509 2018-10-25 13:50:20 @realDonaldTrump OPEC, at Saudi Arabia request started decrease of oil price on late 2014 for bankrupt of US oil shale producers, isn't honest. I propose to bankrupt they with -1 trillion, to increase DJIA to 30,000 by inputting of 10 trillions of petrodollars on U.S. economy.
5510 2018-10-25 13:50:16 I never gave a timeline. I told you Congress is out of session so they can't attach reality to it. It's another Snake Oil sales tactic to try and buy votes. There is no way it gets passed.  He's already tripling the national debt with the cuts he gave to the rich and businesses!
5511 2018-10-25 13:49:56 Well because I have eczema seasonally, usually the buttering happens in winter when the temperature drops. I keep it simple with raw Shea butter and layer with an oil when needed. I like vitamin E. I’m a Sag .
5512 2018-10-25 13:49:50 I agree some new world wines are excellent value and quality.  I don't agree that their olive oil is better, it doesn't come anywhere near southern Italian (Puglian) olive oil.

5518 2018-10-25 13:49:18 When I pinched my sciatic nerve and couldn't sleep (or, you know, move), my mom had me try CBD oil.  It helped with the pain, but it also helped me sleep. Apparently a lot of people use it as a sleep aid. Maybe research that?
5519 2018-10-25 13:49:10 What's missing in the villainization of oil companies: it describes no future except their defeat, which makes people feel 'why bother changing?', all we have to do is get our politicians to beat them up. This paradoxically leaves the oil companies in control of the future.

5535 2018-10-25 13:47:20 Drink black coffee with butter and mct oil on an empty stomach and then don’t eat anything for 4 hours to burn unwanted fat.

5543 2018-10-25 13:46:23 I think it comes down to the actual value and market value. It comes down to what the dollar represents. Does it represent gold or oil? The value of an automobile can be $25K +. Depreciates $1K by simply driving it home. Does money represent gold or oil? And interest on a loan?

5545 2018-10-25 13:46:05 My fear would be that someone would automatically assume the device is correct 100% of the time and not do their due diligence themselves. I like the effort, though. And, sometimes peanuts or peanut oil wouldn't be labeled (like if someone just touched PB). Could this help there?
5546 2018-10-25 13:46:03 Black seed oil is like anti-inflammatory, anti fungal, antioxidant, promotes heart health, good for skin and beard. Too much more to name. Maca is good for sexual health, muscle building, energy and endurance, reducing blood pressure, fights free radicals, improves mood.
5547 2018-10-25 13:45:27 By 2023 Saudi Arabia will have a sufficient economy without oil, we are halfway there. That’s why we are having annual #FIIKSA to be more than oil dependent.

5764 2018-10-25 13:24:59 Someone told me that baby oil works really well. I’m yet to try it myself, but apparently if you sit in oil for a while, then hop in the shower it helps it come off

I'm a strong YES on 112.

I'm pretty comfortable with the cards I'm holding, oil is going higher.

Venezuela is a country run on oil profit and under heavy US sanctions.

5820 2018-10-25 13:19:30 Cod liver oil can be in gelatin, flax seed in a vegetarian gelatin and hard pills are just chalk and vitamin D3, if all three of them make you ill then it would definitely be something to talk to a professional about.

5824 2018-10-25 13:18:55 (Economist Twitter would say that people would, in your example, take steps to heat their home more efficiently, plan car trips differently - as they may when, say, the price of oil rises -- or favour more fuel efficient cars, etc. ie: Consumers respond to price changes.)

5830 2018-10-25 13:18:14 I find it interesting that you complain about a vote on a bill when you have walked your party out of a couple of votes.  Is it just because it’s oil that you have an opinion?

5833 2018-10-25 13:17:58 And oil companies in Canada should be more vocal about their product. It is a clean product and the industry is well regulated. No minimum wage complaints or employee abuse. Oil companies are probably the best infrastructure builder in communities.

5844 2018-10-25 13:17:28 The SEC has approved ETFs for commodities other than bitcoin that are traded on unregulated markets around the world, like gold, silver & oil.

I'd love to see a study comparing them to bitcoin to see if they really trade so differently. If not, the VanEck ETF should be approved.
5845 2018-10-25 13:17:26 As we now know how much oil & gas is worth in the North Sea, is it time for @scotgov to think about setting up a national oil & gas company to invest in all the oil & gas in Scotland?
5846 2018-10-25 13:17:26 Aha, the seal blubber barons of our time. From my recollection the market for seal oil dried up very quickly when it finally happened.

5850 2018-10-25 13:16:45 Thanks Glen. Readers should note that this "space" for new oil investments requires massive reductions in coal and natural gas emissions. These paths are are not existing runways for oil; they are airports not yet built.

5917 2018-10-25 13:10:18 Lalit you may be from IT,  I may be from Accounting... But we all know that the oil price issue is because of Trump (US Pappu)  policies.  Exporters dealing in foreign currency have definitely benefited a lot due to the current forex rates.

5946 2018-10-25 13:05:57 There's plenty of places we can buy oil from, but they wont sing your tune, so you sanction them. There's also other nations that want arms we could sell to, let Saudi buy from Russia.
There's a lot more than meets the eye, going on here!

5948 2018-10-25 13:05:52 Read the article. That's not what they are charged with. That the charge is related to the sale of CBD oil is even further proof that we live in a #policestate.

5972 2018-10-25 13:03:36 So my girl told me she caught her man cheating while she was at work (they work together at the bar) so she asked her boss to leave work for a couple hours, went to their house, put lube and oil all over his stuff then came back to work like she was good til they got off

6054 2018-10-25 12:55:52 I can’t wait until we stop talking about range with respect to #ev. It’s totally overblown.

Nobody seems to care that a Corvette can’t drive for any more than 270 miles or so before stopping to fuel up... (not to mention oil changes etc).

6059 2018-10-25 12:55:14 I have. It really is. But you need whole ton a oil
6060 2018-10-25 12:55:13 You have not, but others do suggest exactly that. No chemotherapy or radiation required. Just cannabis oil. That terrifies me until such time we have more complete studies. The cannabis community is wrought with half truths, it concerns me how people read these articles.

But I'm guessing they don't make road tar from sap (anymore) but just use crude oil and that's all kinds of dangerous

6107 2018-10-25 12:49:58 yeah, i'm coming around to that position as well re: our industry's relative cleanliness. but seeing a story trumpeting how oil expansion will make us all stupid rich without acknowledging environmental issues, on the heels of a lacklustre carbon policy, is admittedly annoying

6110 2018-10-25 12:49:38 The reason for their attack on our noble beautiful prince Mohammad Ibn Salman Ibn ‘Abd Al ‘Azeez (حفظه الله ورعاه) is primarily because he said 2 things:-
1- we will not be an oil based exit anymore.
2- we will build our own defense & offense weapons

6129 2018-10-25 12:47:31 My wife uses it as a carrier for her MCT oil like a meal replacement. Easy to take with on the go plus we do not go to any fast food chains. So we're outliers and likely not helpful. 
6130 2018-10-25 12:47:25 I have used both. But with different objectives. Olive oil to give life to those flames and grains after a nice cleaning/sanding the outside of the stumel. Let it dry and finish with the carnauba. It has worked with no downsides (smells or discolloration).

6169 2018-10-25 12:43:52 Waxing helps a lot with those sores/in grown hair, so rather wax instead of using shaving cream or blades
Lavender oil also assists with removing the sores and darkness, but this I am not 100% sure about
6170 2018-10-25 12:43:41 Personally I don't like it. Anything with fat can get moldy or even burn. It can even make your pipe turn dark (may not want that). I like to use Carnauba wax. Olive oil is wonderful to cook with, not for your pipe.

6177 2018-10-25 12:43:13 Well, I like it in milk. Add 3 tablespoons to a glass of milk in a pan, add quarter glass of water(optional). Wait for it to boil and thicken to your desired consistency. You can add nuts to it, too. 

Can make it oil free to taste like salan too. Tastes like haleem that way.

6182 2018-10-25 12:42:54 If the price fixing happens overseas they can't be done for anti competitive behaviour here. It would be interesting to look at cost of oil per barrel versus the value of the Australian dollar versus the cost per litre of petrol over the last 20 years. Something's not right!

6240 2018-10-25 12:38:34 The crude oil market is still uncertain over the likely impact of the renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran, but two things seem to be becoming clearer: Iran is struggling to keep buyers, and much of the crude it is shipping is being stored

6252 2018-10-25 12:37:45 Oil companies are profit conscious period! Once in a while they are forced to play some mimickery of caring about the environment or the societies where they operate, but essentially profit is their bottom line.

6297 2018-10-25 12:32:43 But the fact they are emphasizing/repeating it as they go into JMMC means that is the takeaway message they want the market to hear. They easily could have repeated that they will unleash oil to keep things well supplied. Instead they are setting us up for a cut. PX matters

6307 2018-10-25 12:31:21 My recommendation is usually to follow what is recommended by the manufacturer. I believe that most of those 3.3L cars are on a 7.5k schedule which would put you at changing the oil about every 2.5 months.

6617 2018-10-25 11:59:44 So you have to vote on banning Vaping and Offshore oil drilling in Florida, all in the same Group category, because it is logical to group Vaping and Offshore Drilling... yeah, right. We all get it.

6625 2018-10-25 11:58:45 @Meldawson6 I decided to block the palm oil lobbyist and her minion. Shame I’ve ruined their fun but hey they can still see my posts from all the fake accounts they set up. So childish but they still want to be relevant somehow, even if they’re known as a bad joke to many.

6629 2018-10-25 11:58:32 Those are are the excuses always given by so called environmentalists. The same has been said for Bujagali, Karuma, Isimba etc. oil has been drilled all over the world in the oceans, Amazon etc and people continue to live.

Writing to bring into your knowledge that the Oil line of Buyco in Arabian sea has been burst & turned the whole costal line of Mubarak village & Cherna Island polluted with the lose of marine life & its beauty please investigate it & fine the culprits
6634 2018-10-25 11:58:01 Also won't the oil freeze
6635 2018-10-25 11:57:53 I have to agree with you.  I’ve and and an oil trap would have the same effect
6636 2018-10-25 11:57:49 1. Oil price increase is under Resource Degradation.

2. Now you admit that the administration itself has mishaps that why inflation ballooned.

And wait, did he really addressed/given solution to the inflation issue? The last I hear, the average inflation rate is still at 6.2%.
6637 2018-10-25 11:57:48 What a shite strawman. You breathe the same atmosphere as ISIS so you must be an ISIS supporter, Richard. That's the extent of your argument. For all I know my oil use is all Canadian.

6639 2018-10-25 11:57:42 Most people over wash their face &strip away toomuch of the skins necessary moisture and oil. I would say I have told 90% of my clients this over my 25yr career. If you have normal dry even combo skin only wash your face once at night. No re-cleanse in the morning. Wasted

6644 2018-10-25 11:57:03 he deadass acts like oil is some kind of sauce
6645 2018-10-25 11:57:01 Nope, the whole thing stinks...and the only reason nobody is making more of a fuss is oil coming from Saudi and arms going in... Money over morality

6652 2018-10-25 11:56:30 If this is such a big issue, those complaining could fund an alternative, I am sure the Oil rich countries would help.
6653 2018-10-25 11:56:22 Lmao. Olive oil
6654 2018-10-25 11:56:16 why can't u use tongs? get the ones that are not too tight...without any hinges. Or...u could use what's called sinukarandi in tamizh (it's like a steel chopstick used to make paniyaram) n poke the appalam before dunking it in oil n take off when done.

6656 2018-10-25 11:56:16 For the last decade, Nigeria has made an average of $30 billion per  annum from oil. This may look like a lot of money, but when you factor  in our population of close to 200 million people growing at one of the  highest rates in the world at 2.6% per annum, @atiku @AtikuOrg
6657 2018-10-25 11:56:15 Np made in Ghana @okworldglobal @Radio360GH oil city is listening.....

6664 2018-10-25 11:55:52 Would Georgia apply baby oil or some cream to her lovely ass?
6665 2018-10-25 11:55:36 And when they respond by not selling Canada oil? Does Canada have a plan?
6666 2018-10-25 11:55:33 Once you make the dent in their budget... It will fulfil your agenda. Solution is practical not wishful thinking. Even Saudi Prince knows that oil reserves won't help them in the long run. Sun is free for all - use it.
6667 2018-10-25 11:55:33 First day of new job / first commute back on LIRR with new Tumi backpack. Felt a drop of water from above land on new backpack and it’s not raining. Girl next to me took her bag down when I told her and she said that probably her salad is leaking. Oil? #CommutingIssues
6668 2018-10-25 11:55:27 NC coast is next... I vote! If hurricanes destroy our coasts in a sneeze; the oil drilling will only benefit the long haul.
6669 2018-10-25 11:55:08 I’m saying that oil traps will have the same role as ice traps.  jokingly
6670 2018-10-25 11:54:55 The JMMC directed the JTC to continue to monitor oil fundamentals and market conditions as well as conformity levels in its efforts to maintain market balance.

6671 2018-10-25 11:54:43 If only everything was as simple as your mind.
6672 2018-10-25 11:54:29 Well, the time frame where the sun destroys the earth seems a little bit further isnt it.... We running out of oil could happen to our children so its not that far, its not about cutting in the usage right now, but we have to slowly start to shift the consuming.. CO2 is worse tho

6674 2018-10-25 11:54:19 Did I just see cooking oil dancing?
6675 2018-10-25 11:54:07 These rankings are subjective. I brought a brand new Chevrolet 2 yrs ago and not one issue. I had a Honda before that and it sucked my wallet every time I went to get an oil change, always something wrong from transmission, water leaking from sun roof to seatbelt. It was a lemon.
6676 2018-10-25 11:54:05 Oil money is a hell of a drug
6677 2018-10-25 11:54:05 And we keep on buying oil from Saudi Arabia.  Too bad we can't build a pipeline.
6678 2018-10-25 11:53:50 Plenty of fake gold and unrecoverable oil out there, time to be looking for journey stocks or turnaround businesses or growth businesses, not a time to be chasing dreams, stocks that need money from now on, looks like a tough market beware some very shit placings coming

6680 2018-10-25 11:53:40 We (USA) also don't want to take over the middle east, we (USA) want to destabilize the area until they run out of oil.
6681 2018-10-25 11:53:30 OIL? can u read?
6682 2018-10-25 11:53:15 Opt for natural and seasonal foods like whole grains, millets, vegetables, fruit, nuts, dry fruit, herbs, beans and legumes, cow's milk& healthy fats like olive oil, sesame, coconut oil, ghee, seeds of flax, etc

6684 2018-10-25 11:53:05 Indians use the first three ingredients in just about everything they cook. Their nutritional value will probably depend on how much oil and spice goes into the preparation of the dish.
6685 2018-10-25 11:52:25 Nope, never thought of you depending the senator.

PRRD already addressed the inflation issue last time.
- due to oil price increase in the international market
- rice and sugar hoarders 
- mishap in the agricultural governance
- smuggled rice

6718 2018-10-25 11:49:05 So let me make it clear beyond any possible doubt: the Restructuring I  am proposing will not reduce the share of our nation’s oil revenues that  any state currently enjoys.  However, if we are to grow our revenues we  need to change the way we think of our resources and nurture
6719 2018-10-25 11:48:56 @WCCOBreaking @UN The Jamal murder case should include isreal, u.s., and Russia in the investigated.

6762 2018-10-25 11:44:24 Its not a debate. As I develop as a TRADER, I’m realizing how much nonsense is on social media. There’s a guy in this thread saying he hasnt ‘traded’ in 10 months. This is like claiming myself a mechanic because I can change my oil, Yet that’s the extent of my ‘mechanical skills’
6763 2018-10-25 11:44:23 Are you sure you watched the video? Why do you want me to believe Buhari's supporters are like him?

6780 2018-10-25 11:41:55 Number one tip - use fresh pumpkin if u can (I roast a small sugar pumpkin at 350 degrees for an hour - cut in half, flesh down on shallow pan and sprayed with olive oil spray).  Let them cool and scoop out easily from skin.  Also, make sure and use spice - ginger and cinnamon!
6781 2018-10-25 11:41:50 @kudzie_sharara why I support SI22 suspension. Parallel rates increase due to forex demand here will be offset by rand weakness. Rand weakness is likely going to persist. Consumers are net winners but im sorry for oil producers

7042 2018-10-25 11:06:55 Only reason I would ever get an electric car is to stop dealing with the hassle that comes with the combustion engine. From the little I’ve read it looks like teslas in particular don’t need oil changes, charge at home at night, no transmission fluid etc
7043 2018-10-25 11:06:53 アーランド4！？
7044 2018-10-25 11:06:52 Just don't do it near a dryer full of oil! 
7045 2018-10-25 11:06:47 You hover over your weapon within the Weapon and Items Wheel, and click ‘Maintain’. You can then brush, apply gun oil, and you will see a full animation live of it being brushed and cleaned
7046 2018-10-25 11:06:32 As usual, hit the reliable source of income. The people of the Province. Let big oil and corporations, the big contributors to climate change, off the hook. Protect Corporations,stick it to the little guy. #consistent #nlpoli

7048 2018-10-25 11:06:30 Is that their liquid catsuit ones? I don't have black but have a ton of their other colors. Oil is my friend for matte lippies although @elfcosmetics has handy dandy lipstick remover wipes in a tiny tub.
7049 2018-10-25 11:06:29 The saved are like the five wise virgins in Jesus’ parable who are ready for the coming of the bridegroom; they have their lamps trimmed and burning and full of oil—a symbol of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 25:1–13).

Worldwide oil consumption in 2017 was 35.8 Billion Barrels

"Peak Oil" is a topic that I grew up being told about in the 1980s.  "The World is running out of oil" we were told.

7089 2018-10-25 11:00:25 Our use of oil is implicit acceptance of violence - increasinly so as crude oil becomes more scarce.  The global market exports of oil by Saudi Arabia to the west is propped up by arms deals and 'blind eyes' to their horrific regime. 1/2

7097 2018-10-25 10:59:22 I appreciate my guy trying to be helpful but his 2nd piece of advice of "read the manual" is where it's at. Some cars call for an oil change every 7.5k. Changing every 3 doubles your costs for no reason.  It depends on the car which the manual will inform
7098 2018-10-25 10:59:21 So it’s only oil that govt generate fund from? What about the non oil revenue can’t they grow that like the previous did?

7108 2018-10-25 10:58:24 True...  if those plants are all clean, then it is an improvement, but if they are coal, oil, or natural gas, nothing has been saved...

Wind and solar are nice, but I think the end game is fusion.  Current nuclear fission is dirty and a problem, fusion strikes me as the goal.

7113 2018-10-25 10:58:10 When it comes to oil subsidy in Nigeria. It's such a huge dilemma. It's not something you just wake up and remove or stop paying neither is it sustainable to continue paying it.

7123 2018-10-25 10:56:56 Yes, but Mauritania has 3rd world development status so will still be much better off than us. Oil rich countries aren't an issue because they need to sell oil to prosper. It's the settling of old scores by countries we have dissed (pretty much all of them) that will hurt us now.

7133 2018-10-25 10:55:46 Sir, the FG under PDP was borrowing to pay salaries at the time PMB took over. Crude oil was over $60 in May 2015 but dropping. PDP would have made the situation worse. If the election had been held late in 2016, rather than early 2015, Jonathan would not have won in Otuoke

7137 2018-10-25 10:55:15 Thinking about it, even avoiding palm oil products won't do enough, as these companies don't use palm oil in all their products. For example, PepsiCo is apparently of the worst for using non sustainable palm oil & I was buying crisps made by them that don't contain palm oil.
7138 2018-10-25 10:55:09 Thanks for all your efforts Paul at reforming drug laws over he years, I hope you enjoy your well deserved retirement & have some fun! All the best & get some Cannabis oil down you for that arthritis! :)

7177 2018-10-25 10:50:22 in 2017/18 MY Iran decreased imports of Ukrainian sunflower oil in 3 times season-to-season. Reasons - big domestic stocks and increase of Russian shipments
7178 2018-10-25 10:50:17 The only country in the world that is totally dependent on the WTO is Mauritania and maybe us after Brexit. At the moment the oil rich countries are holding the leash and can blackmail us if they so chose though that would probably end in war.
7179 2018-10-25 10:50:07 According to the IEA, electricity will account for 40% of final energy consumption added between now and 2040 – the same percentage as oil over the last 25 years

7213 2018-10-25 10:45:06 Governments consistently failed to back CNG, LNG, alcohol to be used at scale for decades, which means we’ve been stuck with oil. Cargo bikes and scooters just don’t cut it in the real world sadly.

7327 2018-10-25 10:27:32 My illness is particularly prone to attracting snake oil types, precisely because mainstream medicine currently has little helpful treatment to offer and in addition, often treats patients as malingerers. So of course patients get desperate and look elsewhere.

300,000,000 barrels of oil per year. My rough calculation makes that about 2.7 billion but that is using 7.2% tax, the UK has the lowest tax on a barrel of oil.
7370 2018-10-25 10:21:19 Muhammad Ibn Salman The undeclared objectives of the war,number one The work of the oil pipeline project from Saudi Arabia to Yemen to the province of Almahrah and construction of a port to export Saudi oil to the Arabian Sea and escape from the Strait of Hormuz, real state.
7371 2018-10-25 10:21:10 Tired the other week, I got up, went to toilet then I showered, got dried, put on my deodorant, talc, brushed teeth, bear oil etc. Then I went to toilet again, so I got in the shower again and washed it all off, cue being late for work .
7372 2018-10-25 10:21:10 What are you talking about. America has everything even Cobalt. Irudium c I can think of anything we don't have. Oil what? Billy Laverne Kellar for President. Stop sending our trash to China to be recycled
7373 2018-10-25 10:21:02 Yep. Who knows where they would have been if the USA and UK hadn’t kept propping up a corrupt regime for so long that eventually the population revolted. And why were the USA and UK there? Oil. Just like their unequivocal support for the Sauds.

7377 2018-10-25 10:20:47 That would be £330bn being spent in UK, ie Scotland, to extract up to 17 Billion barrels of oil & gas in the North Sea. Even at only $30 per barrel, the oil and gas would be worth more than this cost. You could be looking at potentially up to two TRILLION from the North Sea alone

7380 2018-10-25 10:20:23 How can you check? Presumably all of these dodgy olive oils say 100% olive oil on the label?
7381 2018-10-25 10:20:22 Of course, but my point was that you can eat meat whilst thinking boiling dogs is bad.
You can use soap whilst being outraged by deforestation for palm oil, you can drive a car whilst being worried about global warming.

7382 2018-10-25 10:20:19 @toluogunlesi , can u throw more light on this if you have access to more info.Why r we payin more for subsidy and at the same time payin more for fuel at reduced oil price.Also,why is NNPC using our funds to pay for subsidy without appropriation.Did the @MBuhari gave that order?

7421 2018-10-25 10:13:31 Not clueless - it’s so hard with all the misinformation.
Olive oil is great but only for cold use. It’s too delicate to be heated.
My rule - only cook with fats that are solid at room temp (lard, coconut oil, beef fat etc)
Cold pressed versions of the liquid varieties only!

7458 2018-10-25 10:07:42 Currently trying to get back to my store in a krispey kreme truck with no oil, and bad breaks. Wish me luck.
7459 2018-10-25 10:07:41 Yes. Big oil is hanging in there but alternative forms of renewable energy is the future - electric cars and even trucks. That's why the US - particularly the GOP is so reactionary and opposed to innovation. They are even opposed to Darwin and profess to believe in Adam and Eve.
7460 2018-10-25 10:07:16 with the expired oil sef
7461 2018-10-25 10:07:10 Thanks Jonny. We have a number of initiatives in place to take action on this issue, and we’re on track to sourcing 100% certified palm oil by 2019.

7463 2018-10-25 10:06:45 Right on, comrade! Oil isn’t perfect but it has enhanced mobility+allowed many to prosper. Here’s hoping EV and hydrogen-based future economies will continue this trend 
7464 2018-10-25 10:06:40 When he says "land" I assume he is specifically talking about USA land. That does not bode well for the rest of the planet. Has he been asked about the water around his America First, and does he hold the same value there, or will sailing in the melting ice caps be ok, drill oil?

7467 2018-10-25 10:05:57 Hi Shannon - we hear you. We have a number of initiatives in place to take action on this issue, and we’re on track to sourcing 100% certified palm oil by 2019.

7472 2018-10-25 10:05:16 Ask Wole Soyinka about how they handled OMLs in oil sector. Who are the owners of the oil blocks??  Telecom was the in thing even if you are the one there by then it would have still happened. But the bad part on OBj and Atiku is what they did to NITEL/MTel staffs after.

7474 2018-10-25 10:05:07 Saudi Arabia has money and oil. If they cut ties with Saudi Arabia, who are they going to get the same benefits from, Iran? I think not. In big business, money is more important than life.

My mother told me yesterday they all were told humans and the earth were going to be frozen into the ice age. Now we're melting. All from a reliable sources.
7478 2018-10-25 10:04:11 I wonder how long Saudi oil reserves will last.

7498 2018-10-25 10:01:16 One issue Nigerians need to address is their discomfort with people who hold different views. We let things get personal too quickly. 

It is fine to disagree. Listen, understand, debate, don't hold it against people. 

We need to understand this very basic tenet for progress!
7499 2018-10-25 10:01:11 South Africa's Budget:  N36 trillion

The gap - macroeconomic adjustment by Nigeria to make oil revenue look big ( Currency manipulation)

The Problem with Nigeria's Budget - it lacks credibility.

7514 2018-10-25 09:58:29 @MikeCompany17 Hi can u do a video about Aramco because it is the biggest oil company yet we know nothing about it
7515 2018-10-25 09:58:25 Over its lifetime, a gasoline car indirectly receives  (via oil and gas subsidies) FAR FAR more govt money than an electric car.  What you've failed to take into account is that aspect.  You must roll in all the money our govts put into oil and gas which feeds into the car owner.
7516 2018-10-25 09:58:07 Looks a lot like the back cover of a rear axle from a 1960s car or old pick up truck. Gotta scrape the seal off cleanly or it'll leak oil.
7517 2018-10-25 09:57:46 I’ve worked for global megacorps who want to be ‘agile’ and ‘react quickly to change’ but these are behemoth oil tankers where the captain has to present a ‘shareholder’ friendly approach. So he tells them he can nip between the icebergs, regardless what the other staff say.
7518 2018-10-25 09:57:42 The dinner was nice but the salad was awful. Whatever oil dressing they used was bad. But the steak and salmon were great.

7523 2018-10-25 09:56:25 Societies dominated by motoring and oil industry concerns for decades is not free societies.  How many are subjected to tyranny to quench the thirst for oil.

I think this is why you keep putting inverted commas around 'free'.

7563 2018-10-25 09:50:29 Lard is much more healthy for you than any low fat spreads, canola oil, rapeseed oil, margarine or vegetable fats. Butter is also more healthy than all I mentioned.  Lard, Olive oil (Extra Virgin)  all better for you.
7564 2018-10-25 09:50:03 Not by much. We assume our GDP is driven by Oil. At it's peak, oil provided 12% of our GDP. Currently at about 10%. By the time the oil drys out, fossil fuel contribution will not count for much. It also strengthens the argument for restructuring to help grow the non-oil sector.

7576 2018-10-25 09:48:56 A somewhat simple way to play this is buying put LEAPS either on $oil futures or on $USO and do nothing with them until they light up (definition is 'light up' is personal). Pre-determined risk is capped and you gotta be in it to win it...

7746 2018-10-25 09:22:02 This is great but please show some  truly powerful global leadership & leave the tar sands oil in the ground. Carbon taxes are useless if that mega amount of bitumen based carbon is released on such an epic scale - Trudeau is completely hypocritical on climate change action.

7778 2018-10-25 09:18:31 Another way of looking at it is that the West haven't learned the lesson from Iran in that it's not in their long-term interest to back brutal, corrupt regimes because they have oil.

7780 2018-10-25 09:18:24 Nobody can keep oil price away from anybody oga, govt don't need to tell you how much oil price is before you know. Oil was selling above 100usd as at 2014 why was it difficult to save. No tangible project, what's now the excuse

7796 2018-10-25 09:16:06 That is disputed by the video evidence I posted in another tweet. Cooking oil was there n absolutely no queues were there n nobody was even buying cooking oil, same as bread n other commodities like sugar which are reportedly not available. I can't speak any fuel for now.

7800 2018-10-25 09:15:09 Oil price was only all time high in 2013 to 2014 wen it started decline.  But now oil price is $80 per barrel but dey won't want u to no

7803 2018-10-25 09:14:39 That's a good policy by the govt, no doubt.

But just imagine how much PDP paid as subsidies when the oil price was very high if the landing cost is #180 now @ just $80 per barrel.

So next time u talk about PDP squandering the oil boom era, u all should remind ursef of that

7820 2018-10-25 09:12:36 I doubt that there is very much commercial palm oil that is sustainable at all. Most of the plantations are on newly cleared land and often at the expense of food production for subsistence farming.

7881 2018-10-25 09:04:59 The gang up against is not for national interest but for their selfish interest. About 50 oil blocks will expire by Jan,2019 pmb have boldly told them he would not renew any one for any body which does not go down well with them

7895 2018-10-25 09:02:33 The Australian Commonwealth government are not interested in doing anything about it as usual.  They are down grading marine parks so they can mine and drill for oil.   Australia is the leading nation in fauna and flora destruction.

7897 2018-10-25 09:02:04 Without talking politics, I believe that ministry of energy is too big to be handled by one minister and should be divided in ministry of power & water and a ministry of oil & gas. This may be the solution to be considered..
7898 2018-10-25 09:01:59 It is also dogma v pragma - i.e. Would we rather have the oil or a well behaved middle east?

7913 2018-10-25 08:59:48 Interesting too, whatever is driving the expansion of the universe seems to "inflate" between objects.  We see filaments of galaxies form as things are pushed away from one another.  Think of it almost like an oil and water experiment.
7914 2018-10-25 08:59:40 Also American people are terribly ignorant that they still think 9/11 was a terror attack. That’s why they’ve supported Bush to invade Iraq for vengeance but it was all about business, oil. Then they went Libya and Syria. They killed civilians out there.
7915 2018-10-25 08:59:12 Tell me how much PDP borrowed and what project they were the used for? And why the treasury accounts was depleted to 27b USD even with hign oil prices

7961 2018-10-25 08:49:49 Have you heard of the men in Nigeria and Malaysia who prey upon US women for money? They post fake photos and profiles. They usually are "widowed" with one child, in the US Army engineers overseas,  working on oil rigs, have an inheritance of 2 million, etc. Stay away.

8019 2018-10-25 08:36:20 Hilarious, taking money from Saudis and having army in SA. Imran Khan says that he would like to mediate between SA and Yemen. Mediators are neutral, is Pakistan neutral? Pakistan can only butcher Yemenis/Shias for SA in return of money and oil. Hallucination due to Cocaine.

8026 2018-10-25 08:35:27 True. But I think the way oil is falling, ultimately these guys mental strength in not giving in may prove right. Both Rupee will raise and Inflow will also increase and Govt gets away without a NRI Bond. A south Indian RBi Gov would have chickened out by now

8083 2018-10-25 08:26:47 Seemingly complete opposites in culture. So vices and oil extracting are an “app layer” and profit maximising jurisdiction is a shared “protocol layer”.

8117 2018-10-25 08:20:41 The headline is misleading. The article talks about a 'spend' over the next 3 years not the total worth of oil in the North Sea.

This, to me, is the greatest sign of this govt's incompetence as far as managing the economy is concerned.

Despite all the lip service paid to diversification, oil revenue remains the focus.

8147 2018-10-25 08:14:45 If we always focus on 'ideal' oil for cooking, the 'taste' of the food will have a smell which we may not like.  We eat food in which 'taste' also matters.....

The oil lays at the top until stirred in because the product is 100% peanuts so the natural nut oil rises to the top. Thank you!

8155 2018-10-25 08:12:58 The picture represents #pollution, are you really an idiot? Voting no 1631 just gives big oil more tax breaks. Don't be afraid to do your own fact checking.

8187 2018-10-25 08:07:55 ... while it has become more expensive for regular Oklahomans just to live because we’re being nickel ‘n dimed so the rich and the oil companies can enjoy tax breaks. I believe Edmondson would endorse more equitable taxation, which I also endorse.

8191 2018-10-25 08:07:26 I remember reading a blog post a few years back claiming such, but the author didn't provide much to back it up. Ultimate claim was that flaxseed oil is best for seasoning cast iron because it's low smoke point produces the toughest seasoning.

8200 2018-10-25 08:06:00 Arab Muslim world is mediaeval at best, without oil wealth they countries would be quite a spectacle in all spheres of development.
8201 2018-10-25 08:05:50 Or, lets just do nothing and hope the problem will go away. That seems to be oil and gas industry preferred option.

8203 2018-10-25 08:05:47 but in view of the economic stakes (oil) . hard to believe
it should be that other powers embraye like Germany and take the same retaliation 
otherwise it is hardly lost 

they will play on the delivery flow and will be delivered anyway.

8211 2018-10-25 08:04:29 •Oil based cleanser: This is used to thoroughly remove ALL makeup and dirt on the surface of your face, oil breaks up makeup like no other so i highly recommend.A good and highly used one is the rice water cleansing oil by The Face Shop:)
8212 2018-10-25 08:04:27 I Love California, But @KamalaHarris is doing right in fighting for Hosing reform. Rent has gone up a lot and am glad that wages are going up, but yall need to work on them Gas Prices, Oil Tax is  extreme. Other than that, California is Great! An innovating State 
8213 2018-10-25 08:03:54 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
8214 2018-10-25 08:03:52 Since there's no reason to think we'd be as incompetent as UK in generating maximum revenue from our oil, and since an independent Scotland will deliver #all of the revenues to Scotland, it's of a  great deal of consequence, Malcolm.

8234 2018-10-25 08:01:12 No-code or low-code options are snake oil. Programming uses languages for good reason. Language has a flexible but finite syntax capable of carrying nearly infinite meaning (abstraction). Other representations are not so flexible - try representing boolean logic in a GUI.

8264 2018-10-25 07:56:51 Well, i'm not an American, but it's very simple. They have the oil, so they have the money and with that the power to do anything they want. There is no other answer for it. And because the world still needs the oil, NOBODY is gonna stand up against them.

8279 2018-10-25 07:52:55 I once tweeted that maybe God over pampered us by giving us oil and some people attacked me without understanding my motive. According to history, we were doing fine before the discovery of oil. We have so many natural resources yet untapped.
8280 2018-10-25 07:52:50 There you lied! We had lower oil production in 2004, but we flourished.
Under GEJ, we had  higher FDI. Go and check our records in Aviation sector.
We had upward review of salaries
Oil price was not consisted. The price was declining.
Today we have an elevation in price of oil.

Big Oil only seems to popup when their profits are threatened.
8324 2018-10-25 07:45:15 Or are you proposing a form of intervention that wouldn't result in profit for the arms or oil industries? If so, that would be a first for western attention outside our own borders.

If your intervention is limited to 'solidarity', is that solidarity financial? media attention?

8428 2018-10-25 07:28:57 Well done & thank you for making a start on changing your production as a way of improving animal welfare, however I'd much rather see a leaping bunny certificate, no palm oil & sustainable packaging.

8440 2018-10-25 07:26:33 I'm goung to speak frankly: 1. Can't have the same world off oil as on. 2. The lowest-hanging fruit is consumption. Must fall. 3. Resource and enviro collapse is imminent regardless of Global Warming. 4. Microplastics in human feces. 5. Planet determines economy, not vice-versa.

8444 2018-10-25 07:25:49 Back in the real world unemployment is at record lows, a lot of Inflation was actually caused by appreciation in the oil price.

8454 2018-10-25 07:22:44 That is an absolute lie, LNG power projects are very cheap as compare to furnace oil, there is only 1 project on solar, and whole world gives subsidies on public transport. Don't mislead on fact pls

8457 2018-10-25 07:22:06  I thought so too tried it and was just happy I didn't look like everyday is Halloween for me. But 'apparently' coconut oil works like sunscreen too. Let me know how it goes #unfriedchapo

8475 2018-10-25 07:18:40 @realDonaldTrump Don't let the news media and a few crooked senators push you into punishing Saudi Arabia. They must have a malicious ulterior motive. They may be trying to sabotage the economy by causing saudis to raise oil prices and cancel arms deal.

8480 2018-10-25 07:17:26 As Adrian says, the thousands of British seamen who risked their lives on the Arctic convoys and the many who did not return, to provide vital hardware, oil and food to the USSR as it reeled from the Wermacht onslaught would probably be a bit cheesed off with your broader point.

8487 2018-10-25 07:16:12 'India silent on Khashoggi', says Deccan Chronicle editorial. So shd we also stand in line with EU countries and US and denounce Saudi Arabia? OMG! Nehru did so in 1958 & we had a disastrous 1962 war. Saudi Arabia's goodwill is important for India's oil supplies. Let's shut up.
8488 2018-10-25 07:16:07 how tf do people not know when to get their vehicle's oil changed.......like if there isn't a sticker on your windshield from the last change, shouldn't you have a reminder on your phone??????

8499 2018-10-25 07:13:54 Tip: The only reason they add lemon to oil is to cover up the rancid fish smell. Almost all bottled oil is too old.
8500 2018-10-25 07:13:49 We need local industry. How will we ever get USD when we take it out just to buy cooking oil? We need to grow our own till they’re competitive to export huge volumes in the region and beyond. Thanks Micheal for being an advocate.
8501 2018-10-25 07:13:39 PM Modi won't join anti Saudi corus. It's not in our national interest. With Iran oil shipments under cloud we need Saudi oil at better terms also remittances from millions of Indians in Saudi are crucial. With US tightening H1B & legal immigration, we can't.

8526 2018-10-25 07:10:13 In all honesty, how does Buhari's economic policies affect Nigerian growth negatively?

8845 2018-10-25 06:10:10 I get it cheap from our mechanic i have known him since i was a kid. Head gaskets are cheap enough but oil change,filter and oil itself is about 80 plus labour cost. It all adds up 
8846 2018-10-25 06:09:54 Old fashioned, fanny shop. Poor customer service.Give me John Lewis any day..now that's class.
8847 2018-10-25 06:09:05 People need to understand, autonomous without EV is pointless because once you remove the driver, fuel and maint. become the biggest cost. Who will pay 2x+ per mile for ICE over EV? Add in oil change every month and breaks every year. Insanity. EV pays for itself in <300k mi.
8848 2018-10-25 06:08:44 Thanks. It’s simply not financially possible to cook with EVOO here, it’s hugely expensive and is purely a dressing. I cook with olive oil from Greece which is what it says. Italian stuff is blended and a lie. Coconut oil now widely available here and pricey
8849 2018-10-25 06:08:28 I’d be more concerned by the oil stains in my cassock alb. Cold water and salt for blood, but oil flowing down my beard etc. Much harder to shift
8850 2018-10-25 06:08:21 What about CFU members? The industry import crude oil hence local production of soya beans does not affect upstream production. However it's a loss of revenue for local farmers. Let's work together (academia&private business to boost our agriculture)

8852 2018-10-25 06:08:12 Exactly. The man is a snake oil salesman.
8853 2018-10-25 06:07:51 It looks to me that they source and build these ICE cars in Norway where we have 100% clean energy and compare them with production of EVs produced in countries with 100% coal fired energy. And On fill the gas tank with “clean” North Sea oil, that’s is again refined in Norway

8939 2018-10-25 05:51:51 For inquiry on how API collects its data, you should ask API yourself. There's a weekly discrepancy, but over the long run, the numbers eventually converge since total oil storage is reported, while the changes week-to-week may vary.
8940 2018-10-25 05:51:42 I mean what they are doing. They lease the Veterans’ land to  oil drilling and UCLA soccer but leave homeless veterans in the street. It’s true.

8972 2018-10-25 05:46:01 Cut BC gasoline to 0 from the existing pipeline & switch over to oil. BC consumes 87 Mb/d RPP, 40% from AB. So, 34.8 Mb/d extra for oil. Ship RPP by rail & truck from AB. RPP high prices & shortages for BC (rail 3X pipeline, truck 2X rail). BC uncaring of AB. Quid pro quo.

8994 2018-10-25 05:41:02 It’s nice to bring in external references.

9019 2018-10-25 05:36:34 Not solely, not primarily, not largely either. 1988 certainly improved Calgary’s amateur and pro winter sports. But the influences from and people for oil & gas, agriculture, technology, finance...from all over Canada and the world, changed Calgary far more.

9026 2018-10-25 05:35:11 The Saudi arrangement is ambiguous like will the $3 B only sit in the Govt account or will be used and the deferred amount of oil will have to be paid after each year or will be paid after 3 years. In all probability IMF will be approached and the rupee will slide further

9040 2018-10-25 05:32:27 Peter, your graphic is highly inaccurate. World oil price is about USD77 per barrel. You then have to convert that to AUD. Our petrol and diesel prices basically track the Singapore price allowing for exchange rates and taxes.

9102 2018-10-25 05:20:26 I hid the fact that  the Oil and gas exicisted there for over 30yrs It cost me my home my family Scotland now has almost 100% green renewables
9103 2018-10-25 05:20:21 As they should b/c a repeat of anything close to last season is highly unlikely.
9104 2018-10-25 05:20:03 We should be able to take both countries with a swift 24 hr invasion.  Two new stars to add to the flag.  Nice vacation destinations and lots of oil and resources in Venezuela.   Lots of cheap labor also.
9105 2018-10-25 05:19:56 An aside, earlier this year the Chinese started offering RMB-denominated/settled oil trading, backed by physical goal, sidelining the USD. The EU, Russia and other countries are beginning collaboration on an alternative to the US-controlled SWIFT system. Writing is on the wall.
9106 2018-10-25 05:19:56 He was one of my fav Oilers.  Patches was one of my fav Habs.  Nothing against either player from me.
9107 2018-10-25 05:19:55 The weed man gave me this oil for little of nothing. Idk why
9108 2018-10-25 05:19:52 Then look at his lite forecast which is polls only.
9109 2018-10-25 05:19:24 Mayonnaise is actually extremely easy to make. I’m watching all these YouTube videos on how to do it. Didn’t realize how much oil it takes to make it though. Lol I want to make mayonnaise so bad.

9113 2018-10-25 05:18:54 It was one year and I've always considered myself a Perron supporter...dating back to his pre-Oilers days.
9114 2018-10-25 05:18:36 repeating the same crap again and again is the only thing he can do since solutions he does not have.oil on deferred payments and cash in bank is smthing the other governments had been doing..what’s new here??and then they try to tell us how far sighted and genius the man is.
9115 2018-10-25 05:18:33 @seanhannity how old is that profile photo? Time to change that oil.

9123 2018-10-25 05:16:35 Stastny and Schmidt are the big ones for me. The former was always going to need time to adjust and getting hurt won't help. Losing the latter on a blueline w/ little to no star power is a recipe for a disaster.
9124 2018-10-25 05:16:19 around this time last year, I  had  a similar occurrence, I was stuck in the hospital bed and wouldn’t wake up ,  my  mother was scared and didn’t know what to do , nobody did . She went to this Christian bookstoresl bought this book I forget the name, oil of anointing somn
9125 2018-10-25 05:16:18 Pacioretty replaces Neal’s goals. The hope was that Tuch would take a step forward and adding Stastny would improve possession and face offs. Could have added Glass + Brannstrom but thinking long-term with their prospects
9126 2018-10-25 05:15:55 @DrJoeAbah Happy Birthday sir, King of Boys, Ezemmuo. May this new year bring to you surplus stories of victory. May your oil never run dry, and may your glory continue to shine. Wishing you many more happy and amazing years ahead. Enjoy your day sir.
9127 2018-10-25 05:15:50 Hey @JustinTrudeau if you want to win election just increase the pension monthly amount, slow down immigration, make eligible welfare recipients rents covered (without having to spend the food allowance)  and get over the oil pipeline (they already have enough). Cheers!

9129 2018-10-25 05:15:39 Oil language? I KNOW I typed foul...
FU auto incorrect!! 
9130 2018-10-25 05:15:31 But wait, there's more. In the past, OPEC has waited until investments were made in the renewable sector and then increased production to lower the price of oil to bankrupt them all. Then, they lowered production again, and prices rise. It's a sector without morals or ethics.
9131 2018-10-25 05:15:22 These damn stretch marks on my hips/butt are becoming more and more visible. HELP! I been using maddddd coconut oil too. Fuckkkkk.

Shujaat Bukhari and Jamal Khashoggi were both talented journalists, well-paid editors,  silenced by trained government goons. Why no protests over Shujaat? Is it stunt? Is it oil? Is it favouritism?
9138 2018-10-25 05:14:02 I have sensitive skin and i love Rosken (for sensitive skin). It gives me supple skin and i think my skin is getting better day by day. I bought the orange type then realized rupanya ada mineral oil. So, now in pursue of buying HL on Shopee lol.

9147 2018-10-25 05:12:28 They are a good team but in all honesty, did anyone consider them a great team last year. They were a great story but a lot went their way and to their credit, they earned many of those breaks.

9149 2018-10-25 05:12:12 Of course, the feds have little control over rail - CP and CN own the land their rails are on. They even have their own police. They have status that goes back to building the original rail across the country. So, JT and Butts can’t really stop oil by rail!!

9152 2018-10-25 05:11:34 During Pnoy’s time there was an overproduction of oil.
9153 2018-10-25 05:11:33 You’re right, they should be better. Still haven’t found a groove with their full roster. Stastny, Tuch, and Schmidt will make a difference.

9159 2018-10-25 05:10:55 I gotcha! I've been taking CBD Oil since March and it has helped me out a lot. I have been off of both of my anxiety meds for about 2 months now. I will say that everyone's body reacts differently to CBD Oil than the next person. What product did you order?
9160 2018-10-25 05:10:55 Yeah, on paper, they are arguably better.
9161 2018-10-25 05:10:50 The Ipo on aramco is obviously bigger with oil closer to $100 vs $50.  Saudis are gonna bring $2 trillion to the NYSE.  I laugh at the  billion in US arms sales.
9162 2018-10-25 05:10:37 Whenever you give away editorial control you give away your journalistic credentials. If that’s what you are about and entertainment is your main game then that’s sort of ok so long as you don’t pretend otherwise. Oil and water, they don’t mix.

9168 2018-10-25 05:10:05 Wait, Al Gore blames petroleum for environmental problems & he sells his TV channel to Al Jazzera, a petroleum supporting company.  So, it's ok for him to profit from the oil business but we are supposed to pay the price?  No way.

9180 2018-10-25 05:07:30 In Putin's Russia, when 75%of export currency earnings come from oil and gas, and another 25% from other raw materials and low processing, this encouragement of raw oligarchs does not return revenue to the country at all, leaving it offshore. Simple business will continue to bend

9183 2018-10-25 05:06:52 It really sucks depleting forex just to import toothpicks and crisps, cooking oil other locally available basics. I don't know how African leaders think. They even don't think of importing infrastructure developments though having exposure to many foreign travels.

9190 2018-10-25 05:05:23 So what's your magic plan for bringing oil back over $100? For filling excess office space that was started during the boom and completed during the bust?

Diversification? Wooing new industries? Or more investment in the boom/bust oil and gas sector, guaranteeing future crash?
9191 2018-10-25 05:04:48 LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO RT @DearAuntCrabby: Auntie Pro Cooking Tip:

Note that Suncor said just a month ago that it was not done with oil sands projects but would wait for pipeline resolution. Keystone Phase IV is a go, but doesn't help much in current oversupplied NA market.
9198 2018-10-25 05:04:27 To be fair, chances are the Golden Knights may have used up their share of 2018-19 puck luck during last year's run.

9202 2018-10-25 05:04:02 Long term it is really hard to separate politics from market analysis. That tax bill last yr was a big deal.

9228 2018-10-25 04:59:51 Khan’s visit to  sugar daddy paid off. A sum of $6 billion has been promised to Pakistan as assistance in cash & oil for a period of one year as deferred payments. This allows space to Pakistan to resolve issues of finances required to pull the beleaguered economy on its feet. 6)
9229 2018-10-25 04:59:48 Oil is priced in $, so it stands to reason that by targeting inflation, you are tracking the very thing we have no control over. So it’s a zero sum game. Therefor very pointless. What you seek to control is the very thing you can’t because of its contribution (accounting meaning)

9234 2018-10-25 04:57:38 I've been giving hemp oil to my two elderly cats, since one was diagnosed with late stage cancer 5 1/2 weeks ago. He is living a bit longer than predicted, with quality of life. His eyes are less "dull" looking, he's more playful, & both have lusher, softer fur now.
9235 2018-10-25 04:57:33 How much imported Saudi oil for pakistani citizens and how much for pakistan Militray use?

9238 2018-10-25 04:56:46 Economic domestic shocks are made up of four variables. Those are Oil prices, inflation, exchange rates, & output growth in economies such as ours. 

Everything can be netted down to a barrel of oil in as far as goods & services are concerned....
9239 2018-10-25 04:56:43 Where are the oil cartels, you think they would be all over These liberals. It time to speak out. Silent is the alien of no one.
9240 2018-10-25 04:56:19 Nothing is sacred to the destructive Trump administration.  First oil and gas drilling in Alaska’s federal waters which Zinke called a major victory for oil industry. 
9241 2018-10-25 04:56:15 It certainly is, as the only team with a shot of being really good is SJ but that is going to take time...if it comes to fruition at all.

9250 2018-10-25 04:55:17 I know that. What I'm saying is that associated gas (gas that is a consequence of shale oil) is causing a gas glut. LNG will eventually help.
9251 2018-10-25 04:54:59 The dumbest thing my doctor ever told me was My skin is oily because I dont put oil on it...so my face it over producing oils....she said put pure shea butter on it and see if I stop being so oily....THAT WAS A YEAR AGO AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS

9258 2018-10-25 04:54:01 no its natural gas that has been in the 2.50 to 3.50 range for a long time. Fracking deep wells for oil has been around since the beginning.

9260 2018-10-25 04:53:42 Oil industry capex dried up because a slew of mega projects were complete and there is usually a gap before new ones are considered. The price downturn in mid-2014 killed $1T in capex in OPEC countries. Capex is coming back but getting oil off-shore would help.

9276 2018-10-25 04:50:27 I do blame them for buying the snake oil because they're supposed to recognize it for what it is. Yes, partisan gamesmanship can be Petty, but that's positively benign compared to the disaster awaiting us from 4 yrs under leadership of this impious, un-seriius monkey.
9277 2018-10-25 04:50:22 How do you explain the increment in Iraq oil exports last month, isn’t leakage?

9304 2018-10-25 04:46:22 The oil industry created the conditions leading to industry job-losses. It supplied the technology for the US shale revolution, that led to a global supply glut and low prices, and that led to industry consolidation of the pursuit of efficiencies (jobs).

9315 2018-10-25 04:44:57 The misnomer is that you can run a large engine solely on hydrogen, there are lubrication issues that gasoline & diesel fuels handle since they're derived from fossil oil.
We only add a minute amount of hydrogen to air-fuel & create complete combustion, more torque, clean exhaust

9374 2018-10-25 04:35:11 This seems to be an action against Ms. Wasserman-Schultz.
But why?
The Florida Government discussion of last days?
Someone putting oil on fires?
Who?
9375 2018-10-25 04:35:03 coconut oil is the best thing ever
9376 2018-10-25 04:34:38 Crude price falls from $85 to $75.. 
Still these companies reduce prices of fuel by 20paise, 10paise.. 

@dpradhanbjp ,sir, agree, prices are not controlled by govt, but, surely should keep watch on oil companies.

Their pricing manipulation is not hidden.

9377 2018-10-25 04:34:26 Not practicable to relocate an industry, driven by skill & people availability. Such efforts may cause more damage than benefit. Instead take steps to contain damage now & plan better for future. In the interest of environment & oil bills, better to curb pvt trnsprt for daily use

9386 2018-10-25 04:32:52 In early 90s my dorm mate (now a republican who works for a Canadian oil co) started having sex with the TA instead of studying & writing papers. I was horrified. The best was when grades came out he'd given her a 2.5! She was furious. Interesting note: she loved Trump.
9387 2018-10-25 04:32:47 Watched the entire debate, but as of yet can't spread it on YouTube.
My take: no Schiff or Sherman clapping boisterous fans compared to @Johnny_Congress & Green. Schiff slick as an oil spill vs Johnny, a raw voice of the people.
Moderator: a biased b***ch..........
9388 2018-10-25 04:32:41 You keep trying to convince yourself of that so you can sleep at night. The rest of us who are not committed to the cult of personality and don't blindly follow political parties will be over here not buying into what some snake oil salesman is selling.

9515 2018-10-25 04:08:27 Haven't u heard that it's only a foolish country with foolish leaders that won't borrow to fix their developmental infrastructures?
What hav we bn doin with our oil wealth since 1958,a whole s-i-x-t-y yrs, that we don't hav workin refineries,stable electricity,railway system,etc?
9516 2018-10-25 04:08:19 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
9517 2018-10-25 04:08:05 Will do lol! Hopefully this Argan oil helps some
9518 2018-10-25 04:07:44 Methane is hardly the whole problem. NM needs every single drop of water it has. And even more importantly, there are serious health challenges due to fracking—neurological, respiratory, oncological. Oil&Gas aren’t worth taking lives. #Keepitintheground
9519 2018-10-25 04:07:35 Those edges scream olive oil perm gone wrong sooooooo
9520 2018-10-25 04:07:25 That’s hair growth oil really work
9521 2018-10-25 04:07:24 Sustainability is defined on a global level. There is no Canada spaceship floating in space and being sustainable. We ask China to make our stuff and we push Brazil to deforest the Amazon to feed our cattle. The mines for our cellphones in Africa, the palm oil from Indonesia etc

9526 2018-10-25 04:07:00 Our biggest mistake was using the mind numbing"Climate Change Global Warming Narrative"devastation is immediate, from poisoned wetlands, complete disruptions in peoples food chain&Big Oil starting wars to maximise profit,I think it bought evil turds more time
9527 2018-10-25 04:06:59 Now a days Aandavar shop full of oil only. Old traditional taste has gone. Locally grown paasi parupu + Fresh Ghee are the main ingredients. Try shop name " Kishore", they are less famous, newly started but great taste than Aandavar.

9533 2018-10-25 04:05:15 We will be paying more in taxes to cover heating bills on school, hospital and everything in between. We will be taxed on tax. Food will also cost more and everting that depends on oil an transportation, which means everything. 300 bucks are chump change.
9534 2018-10-25 04:04:39 chili oil is her specialty?

9537 2018-10-25 04:04:21 vape oil. Please I must see
9538 2018-10-25 04:04:03 Oh, Arden how tragic this corrupt world. His children weep and oil keeps seeping into that orange ape's hair.
9539 2018-10-25 04:03:51 Essential oil diffuser and some lavender. Along with Netflix and my personal favorite ice
9540 2018-10-25 04:03:50 Same thing for palm oil. Ppl like it because they think it’s more environmentally friendly but don’t consider the impact harvesting and processing it has. Same for beeswax.
9541 2018-10-25 04:03:43 I just went to get my oil changed and the guy was like oh you need to fix your coolant and I was like ?????? So anyways I ended up spending $115 when all I wanted was to get my oil changed :/
9542 2018-10-25 04:03:41 Put on beard oil like a skinny jeans/slouch beanie hipster, and...it's amazing!  #randomthought
9543 2018-10-25 04:03:37 I get excited buying shit like organic coconut oil and cantu lmao
9544 2018-10-25 04:03:32 At this late stage of economic cycle, oil price would have been rising sharply. The sudden price collapse recently, further complicates the situation. Art, is the refinery maintenance over yet? Cheers

9550 2018-10-25 04:02:33 @RockstarGames sorry to disappoint, i was going to buy red dead redemption 2 but had to get an oil change. Imma holla at y’all when my next paycheck hits
9551 2018-10-25 04:02:29 I love when i get out the shower freshly shaved and apply coconut oil all over my body...I be feeling like I’m freaking myself

9553 2018-10-25 04:02:08 Because our oil is largely exported and our petrol and diesel is largely imported.
9554 2018-10-25 04:02:02 No it’s oil
9555 2018-10-25 04:02:00 & not nobody that’s gonna throw oil in my bair after it’s braided down for a weave i can do that myself 
9556 2018-10-25 04:01:30 In mining? In earthworks? In off-shore oil drilling? In ocean commercial fishing?

9559 2018-10-25 04:00:47 It’s choice of profession if you look at job distribution based on gender more women choose jobs like teaching and men choose trades. Trades earn more than teaching but are harder and aren’t as emotional/social idk what to call it. Some jobs men do most women like oil rig work.
9560 2018-10-25 04:00:40 I went for an oil change, brake replacement and tire rotation. I didn't authorize them to check my fluids, spark plugs etc...or to do that before doing the brakes.

Anyways....

9565 2018-10-25 04:00:01 Because there are better energy products out there. Because #climatechange. Because oil and gas reserves are dinosaurs now.
9566 2018-10-25 03:59:46 Msg #3: Dr Mercola warns about long term use of antibiotics eating away at the brain. Add egg and coconut oil to your diet for brain function. Purepaleo Protein from a company called Designs For Health can help with brain function. I got Lyme in the early 80’s, diagnosed in 2013.
9567 2018-10-25 03:59:27 FYI- for those interested in CBD for pain management you can make your own oil very easily with MCT Oil & CBD Isolates far cheaper & you can modify the dose to your suiting. Alot of ppl say cost is an issue, this is a way around that.
9568 2018-10-25 03:59:17 Most standard veggie oil ppl use to cook with comes from soybeans. That’s why the tariffs on soybeans are having a  huge effect on many different areas of commerce.
9569 2018-10-25 03:59:16 Bull dust. The Saud are Neanderthals. Take away the oil and they have...murder and barbarism
9570 2018-10-25 03:58:59 do you smell like oil on canvas? i can pass your info along.
9571 2018-10-25 03:58:21 High earning occupations like working on an oil rig, most women can’t do it so I would agree. But most women choose things like teaching while men choose trades. They themselves choose lower paying jobs.
9572 2018-10-25 03:57:40 Which brand of oil are they selling in Greens? I really hope its none of the brands from United Refineries. I submit that all retailers profiteering from local brands should be put on stop supply by the supplier. Alternatively the consumer should buy elsewhere.
9573 2018-10-25 03:57:38 it also depends on how old the car is, but if you changed it 1.5 months ago, im sure it should be fine .. lol just check the oil
9574 2018-10-25 03:57:17 I personally don’t see a difference in terms of health/enviro impact. Highly refined parrafin wax coats everything from fruit & veggies sold in groceries stores to wax paper and it takes a lot of crude oil to process soybeans into oil but like I said, that’s a different debate.
9575 2018-10-25 03:57:14 Castor oil is not playing with my hair at all.. you know how my kitchen was always short  it’s growing now
9576 2018-10-25 03:57:09 นั่นสิ.. ไม่เอาดีกว่า
9577 2018-10-25 03:57:06 Idea: unpeel a bunch of plantain into a big ass bowl, pour into a baking pan, add small oil, put in the oven.  Boom...boli-cake
9578 2018-10-25 03:56:53 From your map, if Manitoba is on board, there would be a way to move oil for a good part of the year by water.
9579 2018-10-25 03:56:48 Those Americans in PR died because PR was neglected by FEMA. The POTUS is a worthless piece of shit but he didn't go down there and send them a hurricane or screw them over. This is like blaming Obama for the BP oil spill or Bush for Katrina. Doesn't track.
9580 2018-10-25 03:56:47 That was a good catch regarding the comparison between two famous journalists calling for the use of the oil weapon.
9581 2018-10-25 03:56:33 Burning the midnight oil. It smells so bad.

9583 2018-10-25 03:56:21 The U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil are only good for other oil producers and America's Middle East allies - the rest of the world was not taken into consideration.

Just like U.S. pioneered drone warfare & others followed, this kind of unilateral action will be copied by others.
9584 2018-10-25 03:56:19 Bbrp waktu yg lalu ke Bali, penasaran dgn tmpt gawl yg lg happening di Ubud. Di mejanya ada tulisan "bla 3x not using palm oil"

Should I use Ghee or Mustard Oil or Til Oil ? 
9587 2018-10-25 03:55:46 sana oil
9588 2018-10-25 03:55:37 Let's remember this when the economy starts to tank on @realDonaldTrump watch. He will blame it on the Democrats if the GOP loses the elections.  But it's really b/c of the trade wars, global oil (Iran) tensions & tax 'cut' that's reduced corporate tax & enlarged the deficit.

9593 2018-10-25 03:55:07 Vegans can eat all kinds of fried vegetables  so long as the oil in which they are fried is plant-based.
9594 2018-10-25 03:54:52 Anyone else get high and just stare at the bud or oil you just hit and think of how amazing that shit looks
9595 2018-10-25 03:54:52 Cuz #MSM is basically owned by Big Oil Shills, @DNC just decided to take dirty #BigOil bribes again.. @GOP is a subsidiary of @exxonmobil. Ad Revenue is more important to them THAN #ThePlanet @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @CNBC @CBSNews @TODAYshow @CBSThisMorning @GMA @business
9596 2018-10-25 03:54:42 I fuckin love kastrol oil
9597 2018-10-25 03:54:38 I actually recommend using oil before moisturizer, fwiw. It sinks into the skin better, and the moisturizer seals it in (and if you put oil over SPF you break down the sun protection, that's why SPF should always be the last skincare product you put on)
9598 2018-10-25 03:54:34 まぁでも絶対勝つから問題ない。
9599 2018-10-25 03:54:30 PSA - olive oil takes off makeup if you don’t have any remover!
9600 2018-10-25 03:54:29 More due to monopoly of petro dollar as currency by the middle East oil country association (forgot the name)..
Multiple historians even go as far to say US vs Saddam Hussein was only bcoz Saddam was against petrodollars..
9601 2018-10-25 03:53:31 見れないよね〜〜〜ちくしょ〜〜〜！！；；
9602 2018-10-25 03:53:15 Which essential oil will help me get an A on this test tomorrow?
9603 2018-10-25 03:53:06 The oil is. It’s a big thing in the candle world bc many consumers believe it’s more environmentally friendly and less toxic than refined waxes derived from crude oil. That’s a separate debate....
9604 2018-10-25 03:52:52 Because like I JUST got an oil change about a month and a half ago and i already am at the mileage suggested lol.
9605 2018-10-25 03:52:52 I agree. With the billionaires buying the elections and their cronies, we get: polluted water and air, takeover of OUR public lands 4 oil/gas exploration, poverty level wages, etc. Thought that Kyle had enuf smarts 2 know this. I was wrong.
9606 2018-10-25 03:52:49 Asil the annoyed,  hoarder of peanut butter cookies and baby oil 
9607 2018-10-25 03:52:44 Every country has its opportunities and challenges for achieving energy and environment goals. For many years Mexico has faced challenges in properly aligning its oil and gas sector to generate the prosperity that will drive long term transition and is recently re-evaluating too
9608 2018-10-25 03:52:36 The government collected taxes on people, livestock, land, oil, olives, wine, beer, fish, and more. Nearly every business exchange was taxed. The most prominent tax in ancient Rome was the tributun, which was a tax on material wealth
9609 2018-10-25 03:52:32 finally, something other than a shooting,  killing or oil spill from @CNN
9610 2018-10-25 03:52:28 And every Canadian pays at the pumps etc. and every taxed industry passes the extra cost to the consumer. Except, of course, the oil industry which is at the mercy of global pricing (OPEC). Who can believe this is a real solution with no cost to the Canadian people?

9616 2018-10-25 03:51:55 #SaudiArabia has long dealt with foolish attempts of intimidation & pressure, which have always failed. During the 1973 oil embargo there was open talk about “occupying Saudi oil fields” which was met a by #Saudi warning of the consequences of such a foolish action.
9617 2018-10-25 03:51:53 @PMOIndia @vijayrupanibjp @CMOGuj @dpradhanbjp @PetroleumMin @IndianOilcl Most of Crude Oil and Natural Gas in India are Imported from #KandlaPort and #MundraPort in Kutch-Gujarat,But still No-CNG Services are available locally in Kutch. Request you to please make it possible.
9618 2018-10-25 03:51:42 Wooo scalp twins! And nope. Best stuff I’ve tried is prescribed Talclonex but that sh*t is crazy expensive. Tea tree oil and shampoo helps the itch a bit. I’ll be interested if anyone else has suggestions too.

9625 2018-10-25 03:50:32 Do you REALLLY have to get an oil change every 3 months.... or EVERYtime you reach the mileage that it suggests?
9626 2018-10-25 03:50:19 I use coconut oil. Shit be decent
9627 2018-10-25 03:50:13 Gonna take a break. Then I'm back for #AHSApocalypse right after I find some holy water, annointing oil & rosaries.

9635 2018-10-25 03:48:26 Me: *wielding Baseball bat* “GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!” 

Chevy driver: “Dude I have an appointment for an oil change!” 

Me: “NO! Get the fuck out! This is MY Bay Area Chevy Dealer! They said so on the ad!”
9636 2018-10-25 03:48:21 The notion that consumers will get more rebated than what they are taxed is 100% snake oil.  You and I both know that virtually every consumer necessity will cost more due to the carbon sham.  We also both know it will do zero for climate change. You can't snow the snowman.
9637 2018-10-25 03:48:19 You are frauds and just like fontus you'll be gone soon enough, people are getting wise to snake oil salesmen and the laws of thermodynamics
9638 2018-10-25 03:48:11 Ok maybe i do regret the oil burn because i burned my drawing hand and it's a pain
9639 2018-10-25 03:48:08 It’s like 99% about the quality of the tomatoes and the olive oil.
9640 2018-10-25 03:48:04 We captured Iraqis on an oil platform and they were hunting food using hand grenades  !!!!!!
9641 2018-10-25 03:47:59 Except Snake Oil, it is the bomb! Big Pharma tried to keep it secret.
9642 2018-10-25 03:47:58 Yes. Oil and vinegar is the way. Especially on an Italian or roast beef.

9646 2018-10-25 03:47:21 Well the best tomato sauce ever is just 3 cloves of garlic sliced and toasted in a giant glug of olive oil, then tossed with the contents of a 28oz can of A+ tomatoes. Crush them on the way in with your hands. Cook until thick. Add a little more EVO at the end. Salt to taste. 
9647 2018-10-25 03:47:18 Was swooning over lavender (oil) today with my coworker. Lol! 
9648 2018-10-25 03:46:41 Understandable, was referring to crude oil precursor of diesel fuel and engine oil.  Oil, more so in questioning why lock up a freight rate if those inputs appear to be trending lower in price.
9649 2018-10-25 03:46:32 I’m scared to get an oil change because I know they will be sexist towards me and yell at me about my oil pan even though I am well aware my car is falling apart but I am poor
9650 2018-10-25 03:46:26 Dear @kaylawhitefield, 
Bless you for telling me about Good Sleep oil  life changing. 

Love, 
Ktown. Ps. I miss you. Come visit.
9651 2018-10-25 03:46:04 Got an oil change on my lunch break today. #adulting
9652 2018-10-25 03:45:56 Forget the arms, how’s about we stop buying oil from them? #EnergyEast
9653 2018-10-25 03:45:49 I’m thinking about doing this, the only lotion I use is cetaphil, works great, but I love jojoba oil on my skin more, but I itch on my legs when I don’t use lotion, I don’t think the oil goes deep enough
9654 2018-10-25 03:45:19 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
9655 2018-10-25 03:45:17 CNN hasn't been on my TV since the oil spill in the gulf years ago. Why? You know 
9656 2018-10-25 03:44:43 jejeje it’s tea tree oil
9657 2018-10-25 03:44:15 When you tell him you haven’t had an oil change in months 
9658 2018-10-25 03:44:11 Why is Canada still buying oil from Saudi’s? If you want to do something that makes a significant impact, stop giving them money for something Canada has plenty of - Oil!
9659 2018-10-25 03:44:09 A lot of people have forgotten what happened when The Chinese workers were killed at CNRL. A google search will take you though the years of coverage and demonstrate the power of oil/gas
9660 2018-10-25 03:44:05 Someone do a fancypants oil painting of this stirring tableau.

9662 2018-10-25 03:43:44 Why would the NZ Gov shut down oil & gas exploration given it only emits 0.1% of global emissions?
9663 2018-10-25 03:43:41 I agree with you but the conservatives in USA that want smaller govt, less regulation nd less handouts also increase the military budget, ban marijuana and give subsidies to oil companies......ie. they are lying to you, big business are liars and so are pro business conservatives

9667 2018-10-25 03:43:11 Of course why not typical of @JustinTrudeau buy some more votes.  Amazing how there are 33 million people in this country and we barely populate it but is seems like the Indians populated the only areas with oil and resources. They must have has great geologists. .. oh wait
9668 2018-10-25 03:43:02 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot
9669 2018-10-25 03:43:01 It is crazy and it is suppressing oil prices. Remember, development of China and 3rd world was supposed to mean multiplying oil demand, which is why oil skyrocketed.
9670 2018-10-25 03:42:52 CONT; Oil Depletion Allowance aka welfare for billion dollar Texan Oil Barons and nationalising the production of money to the Treasury hence, 1 JFK Silver Backed Dollar is now worth like 32-34 USD. Most Nationalists are also, pro Science not against it if it harms our profits.
9671 2018-10-25 03:42:50 I don’t even use lotion anymore. I literally only use oil.
9672 2018-10-25 03:42:49 There's a pizza resto in Banff that serves with honey and chili oil. Swirl them together on your plate and dip in. It's incredible
9673 2018-10-25 03:42:44 It’s amazing what a little purple shampoo & coconut oil can do to your hair. In luv <3

9678 2018-10-25 03:41:27 Why are then oil equities falling like a stone? The productivity issue and reservoir exhaustion must have already huge implications on cash flow. Shareholders can smell this.
9679 2018-10-25 03:41:26 Gotta wait for the “change oil” light to come on.

9682 2018-10-25 03:41:14 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
9683 2018-10-25 03:41:14 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9684 2018-10-25 03:40:55 Well, having taken on energy policy, science policy (banning climate change talk), ocean drilling (everywhere he can), using military bases for shipping oil, now Zinke takes on health-drug policy. Too bad he failed at all of these & even more at Interior's real job! What a loser!
9685 2018-10-25 03:40:54 Hi Sara. Your pizza with tomatoes and motor oil will be delivered in 39 min via rocket.

9687 2018-10-25 03:40:52 Or that the Government will take action for political reasons, regardless of whether evidence for action exists or not - see oil and gas decision.
9688 2018-10-25 03:40:51 It’s been months now but I gotta say it whoever invented oil/wax/dab pens should win a prize
9689 2018-10-25 03:40:23 What a rise from $29....
People seem to comment from the positions they hold ..
How does a 10$ drop from the highs benefit our trade balance and change the medium term picture
If u calculate oil at  $72 for full year trade deficit no going to cross 2012 highs

9692 2018-10-25 03:40:02 Aunt Crabby now now, you know how important it is to eat your greens.   Definitely use a little olive oil, sauté an onion and garlic, and slow cook with the greens on top.  Squeeze some fresh lemon and a little tamari on top I think you’ll like em.
9693 2018-10-25 03:39:50 Time to invest in some lavender oil to help me sleep better LOLLLLL

9695 2018-10-25 03:39:30 Buy spaghetti squash at ur local supermarket and cut it lengthwise, scoop out all the guts w/a spoon, drizzle w olive oil n salt, place insides down on the pan and cook at 400 degrees for 50 minutes :-) then you jus scrape the squash n prepare to ur liking! Easily feeds two

9697 2018-10-25 03:39:07 Texas as far back as the mid-1800s was ripe for oil drilling and getting rich and powerful. The Bush Family based their wealth on oil, which is more likely, due to some information about the Bushes some years back.

9719 2018-10-25 03:36:44 Ain’t that the truth.  The guy I use is now half the cost and no tax and probably better quality, and I only use the oil.

9729 2018-10-25 03:34:53 I have a better idea. Let Texas secede. All right wingers will move to Texas. Wait a couple of years and then invade them for the oil.
9730 2018-10-25 03:34:45 Our domestic production of oil is 88 bpd. How’s that accounted for? 15 percent is local production 88/ 588
9731 2018-10-25 03:34:44 North American version of Syrian Refugee crisis brought on by drought & climate change. The real story that media outlets can’t tell because our oil Dictators won’t let them. They can’t say words like “Climate Change”.

9758 2018-10-25 03:31:02 Ah a money grab from NY state against big oil company in the name of protecting citizens...settlement to follow. Then cost of settlement built into price of fuel. So in effect this is a tax on consumers.

9769 2018-10-25 03:29:36 According to a friend working in exxon mobil, they are all set to start exploring offshore drilling in January 2019, near Pakistan-Iran border in deep sea. 

And if IK is our lucky PM, Pakistan may find huge reserves of oil and gas by March or April. InshaAllah.

9779 2018-10-25 03:27:19 We are mineral owners, primarily Natural gas on land in Tx. Wish it was West Tx crude, but I’ll take whatever they suck from the ground. They send all of it to the NE....we need to get rid of all foreign oil 
9780 2018-10-25 03:27:17 At least DeSantis didn't try to be slick to get the Christian vote talking about when my grandmother used to anoint my head with oil.. man plz, I don't trust sneaky tactics like that esp when it comes to trying to get the Christian vote. I really like you Bob but no to Andrew.

9784 2018-10-25 03:26:59 Imma bring you the Tea Tree Oil tomorrow in class ! Just get the sea salt and try what I did if it doesn’t work(which I promise you it will) then take it out but hold your horses !
9785 2018-10-25 03:26:58 Sure there are other industries. Built with oil money. Thought of any Islamic invention from last 100y?
9786 2018-10-25 03:26:47 The future is in deep kimchee if humans continue to consume 2 trillion gallons of oil a year - and growing. Eventually that runs out, and global economic meltdown is much more dangerous than climate change. Musk knows this and is busting his ass to head it off. That's the future.
9787 2018-10-25 03:26:41 I remember when y’all tried putting Coconut oil on everything
9788 2018-10-25 03:26:35 I know a way that you can catch mice without killing them, you take a decently deep bowl and you put peanut oil in it, make sure that the sides are oiled so that they can’t run up the side but that the oil isn’t deep enough for any mice to drown -
9789 2018-10-25 03:26:34 Bae got the whole house smelling like tea tree oil
9790 2018-10-25 03:26:28 Hearing more from Texas landowners near border who dont want wall makes me think there is something shady about why reds want this wall so bad (I meanyea the racist love it bc they hate brown people) like the war in Iraq oil was behind it i think something in the land is valuable
9791 2018-10-25 03:26:21 The motor runs longer if the oil is clean, further only has meaning in a life time. That's why today is more important than tomorrow. The twitch in the eye, is the third eye that saw it coming. 
9792 2018-10-25 03:26:17 Recycled oil (e.g. from cooking, is used to produce bio- diesel). In theory, bio-fuels should be making a comeback but the industry went into decline some years ago - Government mandates to use bio- fuels are very low.
9793 2018-10-25 03:26:07 Awww no! Kale chips are amazing! Or... wash it. Spin it dry. Then take olive oil, lemon juice and salt and rub it like you would a stained tee... when you feel it getting limp stop. Then serve with some lettuces and other salad items. Yum!!!

9798 2018-10-25 03:25:42 Yesterday I urged CSOs to work with parliament to hold the govt to account on the implementation of the Petroleum Revenue Management Act, no. 22 of 2015. Since FY 2016/17 designated revenue from oil and gas haven’t been deposited into Revenue Holding Account as required
9799 2018-10-25 03:25:41 I always think about switching to oil paints but decide not to because of the whole cleaning brushes business.
9800 2018-10-25 03:25:30 Dua duanya sama bagus tp yg oil lebih ga ribet soalnya ga pake kapas bisa
9801 2018-10-25 03:25:26 Why is it called virgin olive oil? Is it only for virgins? How do you know which olive is a virgin? So many questions that are left unanswered! Most importantly how do you get extra virgin olive oil??
9802 2018-10-25 03:25:21 I bought organic zucchini but, it had that waxy oil on them. So much for paying extra for healthier option.
9803 2018-10-25 03:25:19 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

I believe the pump is for injection, putting out about 30 Ibs.

The engine is dual 4 barrel, and is looking for 3 Ibs...

Way too much gas in the oil, and the exhaust is chit.

Way too much blow by.

It has to be the pressure.

9879 2018-10-25 03:13:47 Yeah, but I live with it because the centerstand makes periodic systems checks a lot easier (in addition to, say, chain maintenance).

I do like to check the oil and coolant when on a longer trip, where I obviously wouldn't be able to take a spool lift with me.
9880 2018-10-25 03:13:42 Since the mid 70's we began driving smaller vehicles. Do you remember the two reasons why? Since then, we have paid gas taxes as a punishment for air pollution. My oil tank just cost a grand for a fill up. I retro fitted rest of home. I cannot go any further. Now this?

9930 2018-10-25 03:06:20 I’m against deadnaming for people, but not corporations, Statoil. Stop offshore drilling. Like, yesterday. Stop all oil, stop all gas. Now. Pay reparations. Y’all need to do way more to earn a new name.

9945 2018-10-25 03:03:32 But the oil!
9946 2018-10-25 03:03:27 Also, if you’re driving a gas car you pay more for gas oil maintenance
9947 2018-10-25 03:03:26 Not keen on secession! That said if Trudeau gets in again that may well be the west’s only option for survival! The east won’t  even burn our oil,Yet They take equalization? The federal vote is decided before we even vote,we have no voice, most in the east don’t seem to care!
9948 2018-10-25 03:03:20 Naomi Klein had a powerful influence on me. BUT! i'm becoming more agnostic about ideology. putting an oil company out of business might cause inequity. more or less rationing, more or less subsidies, more or less equality, are orthogonal to more or fewer oil companies.

9953 2018-10-25 03:02:41 Ok, go to bed now. You worked enough for the money you get. By the way, #MBS is not equal to your country. Saudi regime is the enemy of your country.  Why KSA with over 2.5 trillion dollrs in oil income in past 10 years has over 40% of people in poverty? Why?

9956 2018-10-25 03:02:01 That’s actually what also you want to focus on @ night. A.M. is: gentle cleansing/rinsing with water, Vit C serums, and sunscreen. Night is: deep cleansing, hydration & moisture w/ an oil or sleep mask. Again, nothing that clogs your pores.

9960 2018-10-25 03:01:07 When making cannabis oil at home, people debarb cannabis in the the oven before infusion.  Aren't they losing all the terpenes this way? For me, I decarb and infuse directly within the carrier oil, letting it run longer to compensate.  Am I really preserving terpene this way?

9963 2018-10-25 03:00:47 Can I get some details on what's in the oil? Don't want to spend $25 on something I can't use...allergies
9964 2018-10-25 03:00:44 And cook you dinner. That’s insane.  I just used $3 @brandless coconut oil to moisturize my entire body.
9965 2018-10-25 03:00:36 Dear Calgary, you should spend 25 billion to better market your oil abroad, not host a party imo
9966 2018-10-25 03:00:36 You paint a very poetic scene, the gasoline smell and gear oil did it for me.
9967 2018-10-25 03:00:34 Or invest in mass amounts of solar, or nuclear, and prohibit coal and oil from being SO relied upon. You talk pollution and climate change but I noticed Alberta wasnt on your list of provinces to enforce.... Are the tarsands too big of a bite for you?

9975 2018-10-25 02:59:31 while transmission fluid should be changed every 50,000 miles or so, the color really doesn’t matter unless your car/transmission is experiencing other problems. red transmission oil is new, clean oil - w use the color changes.
9976 2018-10-25 02:59:23 Such a shame that petrol n diesel prices r not reduced even after rupee strength and a huge fall in crude oil prices. Such a shameless and loot govt.
9977 2018-10-25 02:59:22 The Oil and Gas ban is only the very thin edge of a much LARGER wedge .This means that Oil and Gas will NOT be imported at all  So ending our reliance on petrol powered cars . Cannot believe so many here cannot see where all this is going ! Smoke screens and mirrors act by Govt .
9978 2018-10-25 02:59:12 KSA and Russia account for 12% and 11% of the world's oil production. Both of them teamed up and decided to cut down on supply. IMO that is what caused this recent inflation and made things go haywire for all of us. No single entity could've achieved this.

$3 B worth of oil import but we pay it after 1 year, no interest.

Those who are calling it LOAN also think Nawaz is Nelson Mandela 
9987 2018-10-25 02:57:54 The world needs our marketplace more than we need theirs.

9999 2018-10-25 02:55:41 Do you really think no matter whom is president of the United States that we will stop importing Saudi oil? Just like the Russian sanction thing with Russian aluminum! Our industries are still importing their aluminum while Alcoa Wenatchee Works is still shut down! 418 jobs lost!

10004 2018-10-25 02:55:08 At this point, with what Ive put together, all our actions, mentally or physically, depend on 1 thing. How healthy is our blood? How important is it to put high quality gas in your car or perhaps the motor oil? How fast should our blood flow? What should the electrical charge be?
10005 2018-10-25 02:54:52 Can someone please change my oil?
10006 2018-10-25 02:54:41 1時間使ったら1時間待たないといけないのが効率悪いかなぁ
10007 2018-10-25 02:54:38 Oga this is not a competition of between APC and PDP...24hrs light is 24hrs light..
Which one is comparing electricity provision to that of PDP...there are lots of gas flare in oil rich states that burn up everyday..we can easily turn that to energy.
10008 2018-10-25 02:54:37 Good morning! Bears makes their presence felt again as a sea of red engulfs global markets amid a flurry of news including trade tensions, oil prices & rising interest rates.

10009 2018-10-25 02:54:30 Starting tomorrow till Sunday I’m soaking my hair with olive oil and making my own hair masks on sat
10010 2018-10-25 02:54:14 So today we will have bloodbath in the market. Gains from drop in oil prices will vanish.
10011 2018-10-25 02:54:05 I’ve actually discovered that putting oil on my face after a wash helps control the sebum substantially.
10012 2018-10-25 02:53:50 Lived in Texas, and the sad thing is they do little with the oil money that is of benefit to the people. At least Alaskans get a check.
