0 2018-06-21 23:59:53 hahahaha, disillusionment.

irl the average $btc holder is like "hey @CNBCFastMoney, all of your crypto coverage is entertaining, very little is of value".
1 2018-06-21 23:59:46 Ethereum will vaporise into the ether.
From this day forward all ICOs and Devs really should disregard it. 
TRON does everything ETH does except faster, cheaper, rewards Devs, in sensible Java and will have more REAL USERS (not holders) than all of crypto combined.

2 2018-06-21 23:59:45 @Utsava4 hi utsava maybe you can take crypto for petreon with a plugin for woocommerce called crypto woo it can help all the people that wants to pay you in crypto and still enjoy your information 
3 2018-06-21 23:59:37 Yeah, but bcash, eos, and tezos (etc) exist... So I guess crypto has an auto-immunity that is highly prone to cancer.... Crypto has scleroderma
4 2018-06-21 23:59:37 The chances of having two horses in crypto are less than getting 21e8 in a hash.
5 2018-06-21 23:59:23 Don’t engage with that Chomu. He seems a crypto Abrahamic and mentally unstable
6 2018-06-21 23:59:15 Viacoin MAN also is getting rich in crypto, today Viacoin MAN made $142 in one trade, and another for $98. VIacoin MAN is on a roll.
7 2018-06-21 23:59:14 thats what traders do. You obviously are not a trader and thats fine. You buy and hold. We however will sell the top and buy the bottoms on every break out and profit all the way up. Your way is safer if your not a trader. and I agree this is a great project
8 2018-06-21 23:59:12  All under one umbrella  combined it is a very strong influence on you impressionable people 
9 2018-06-21 23:58:43 So sad, I love this project.
10 2018-06-21 23:58:37 नैन एक अच्छा पनीर दोपहर है
11 2018-06-21 23:58:32 Is Bitcoin a Bubble? INTERNET: since 20 years everybody can share infos technically with everybody. CRYPTO: every business can share its own currency with everybody. #getyourownblockchain
12 2018-06-21 23:58:20 I think it’ll be a good addition. It’s an American driven crypto headed by a team of MIT members and with the events partnership with Intel, I think coinbase would want something like Enigma.
13 2018-06-21 23:58:17 This tweet is in regards to a poll done in Feb where people said they would use a crypto issued by Amazon.
14 2018-06-21 23:57:36 そうなんだ…
PCとスマホじゃ送り合えないの？
イーサアドレスが分かればいい訳じゃないんだね。
あまちゃん、お見合い出すタイミング合わせて私も出すよ(´ω`)
15 2018-06-21 23:57:23 You guys kept my fund for weeks due to bad customer service.
I would request my fellow crypto traders not to use changelly they will keep your funds for weeks.
16 2018-06-21 23:57:18 Crypto has autoimmunity? Killer cells should target the mutations, not healthy cells (nodes) that are participating fairly
17 2018-06-21 23:57:17 Mocho, the problem is that this guy is deceiving. He has 30k botted followers and people trust him because of that. For people like Jay that have a wife and kids, he was looking for someone to trade for him as he didn’t have time.
18 2018-06-21 23:57:12 $TRN...this just in...I AM SHOCKED.

Justin Soon is in WAY over his head.  #TRN is the biggest scam in crypto....GUARANTEE it goes to $0
