44 2018-03-19 20:43:45 Capitalism is reliant on the creation of false scarcities to drive profit. When food and water are treated as commodities, optimal profit can only be achieved by pricing a commodity high enough that some must necessarily go without.
45 2018-03-19 20:40:08 Thanks Kelsey. If they weren't so worried about being long resources and spent some money on professional forecasters all commodities would be a lot better off. The increase in some commodities supply and rail demand didn't come out of thin air.

53 2018-03-19 19:48:38 In the absence of a better alternative, commodities have functioned as currency. Right now there is clearly a better alternative, in every single aspect. Not sure which part of that is hard to understand.

58 2018-03-19 19:16:44 However, as refs move up to AAA, junior, and the like, the training gets more granular. The players are known commodities, and the stakes are higher, so it can get more specific, and more detailed. Youth refs ref up to four games a day; impossible to scout each one.

76 2018-03-19 18:05:16 “The less people are commodities the better,” then why aren’t you arguing against people who use their bodies for things like manual labor or performance art in capitalism that are subject to harassment or coercion?
77 2018-03-19 18:01:19 I also didn't say that intimacy was bad. I said supporting the sale of sex is bad. Regardless of what the individual chooses and their individual context, we cannot ignore the larger social ramifications of allowing the sale of sex. The less people are commodities the better.

129 2018-03-19 14:34:19 Thanks! Would be fascinating to see at sub sectoral level. I suppose what i meant is a decline could be expected after the unusual highs of the commodities boom? The negative ratio could partly be a rebalancing of the wild party of the late 2000s ;)
130 2018-03-19 14:30:54 #OBAMA's #FED may have so disoriented the credit markets they may NOT be able to transition back to a REAL "Market" (meaning they actually function without govt MANIPULATION)=we could be looking at equity and commodities markets that potentially just collapse due to dependencies
131 2018-03-19 14:30:06 the central banks around the world loan money to the "#TooBigToFail" banks around the world to make stock Bond & commodities "Markets" do whatever they want ... it's a fraudulent mis-representation to even call them "markets" any more ... the Problem?? they can NEVER GET OUT!!
132 2018-03-19 14:23:42 I'd say 15 and 16 are the only ones who truly hurt us because of the length and their utter lack of talent. 53 and 1 have both proven to be legit commodities and having a little under $7M in combined bad salaries isn't going to kill you with the cap going to $80M

134 2018-03-19 14:22:42 Nigeria is a commodity dependent economy and when there is a boom, the economy thrives, in a burst they suffer. According to the economic complexity index, Nigeria is the 52nd largest importer in the world and commodities like wheat, corn, rice, raw sugarcane.
135 2018-03-19 14:19:00 Because even if one nation is less efficient than the other nation in the production of commodities, trading can still benefit both nations! Yasssss tudiaaaa :)
136 2018-03-19 14:13:10 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.

232 2018-03-19 04:06:25 We need to seriously organize a summit to discuss our drug laws in this country for real cuz prohibition does far more harm to our society than legalization and taxation of said commodities. Just a though you’re an influencer you can make it happen

234 2018-03-19 03:59:55 Yes ok. Thx. Holding winners can be hard but unless it’s more volatile stocks like biotech or some commodities, I can hold shares easier than LEAPS calls.
235 2018-03-19 03:52:02 @RahulGandhi is loan waiver and increase in support price is a right solution to save our farmers answer is no because it ultimately increases the inflation and farmer has to buy other commodities at higher prices. solution is to increase productivity and integrated farming
236 2018-03-19 03:42:18 And life is different with free agency outside the top 25 hot commodities out there. So I think those 7th round and 6th round picks are over valued.
237 2018-03-19 03:24:06 Slave owners had a very definite idea about the political economy of the United States, focused on the export of agricultural commodities to world markets, free trade, and the territorial expansion of the slave regime into the American West.

244 2018-03-19 02:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
245 2018-03-19 02:33:37 No way, in my opinion there has never been fake health commodities without any negative impact on the lives of the population. I am inclined to think that perhaps the conclusion drawn was rushed to cover-up something
246 2018-03-19 02:14:19 In a world were phones are becoming commodities.... Good luck
247 2018-03-19 02:06:26 We cannot call ourselves black because we don't know the black struggle. Our ancestors weren't taken from their lands and sold as commodities in another land. Our ancestors crossed the oceans choosing where to go, it was never chosen for them.

249 2018-03-19 01:54:54 And all ferries will flock from plains, commodities sold by them and "hatha laagey sunya"
250 2018-03-19 01:51:53 Who cares apple is the luxury brand in a market where phones have become simple commodities
251 2018-03-19 01:50:16 Correct!!!! Apparently she is a Commodities Genius.   I doubt it had nothing to do with inside information.  Some people are just lucky.
252 2018-03-19 01:42:54 "Chattel slavery, also called traditional slavery, is so named because people are treated as the chattel (personal property) of the owner and are bought and sold as commodities.... under the chattel slave system, slave status was imposed on children of the enslaved at birth."
253 2018-03-19 01:41:50 And China during that time also used/managed the ratio between commodities to drive preferred economic outcomes...yet most westerners find the possibility of china using gold/oil ratio to drive preferred economic outcome (current account surplus mgmt) "inconceivable!"
254 2018-03-19 01:40:15 Se dispararon los precios de los commodities, Uruguay es un país chico, dependemos de la exportación y los precios de los commodities influyen muchísimo sobre la economía del país. Al FA le tocaron años de commodities por las nubes. No sigo porque no tiene sentido. Saludos.
255 2018-03-19 01:32:24 I do wonder what HE would do if he and his buddies each had 1,000 consciousnesses that could be uploaded. Would he set them up in proper bodies, or would he perhaps develop a start-up in buying and selling them like commodities? I think I know the answer.
256 2018-03-19 01:29:20 I see this pullback in commodities temporary, so plays into my thesis nicely.  Once $USD resumes downtrend,

Information, content , even posted art, photo's, is all commodities to be sold or used to sell "someone or something" = Followers are money,even if not originally
260 2018-03-19 01:10:24 I own two cars, a few antiques, about $35 in crypto currency, some savings, and a few hundred in commodities and it wouldn't be enough to pay off my student loans.

264 2018-03-19 00:38:34 I appreciate the point...and wonder if what makes housing different is the nature of shelter, as opposed to commodities or other goods in the system. If one were to believe that housing is a human right, how would that change the analysis?
265 2018-03-19 00:38:02 ... OR if ppl there are happy wid Modi Gvt at centre - on delivery of promises, Demonetization, way GST implemented, pakodanomics, price of essential commodities, BJPCongJointPNBScam etc ... (cont'd)

268 2018-03-19 00:27:48 Correa hizo su gobierno financiado con commodities petroleros.
269 2018-03-19 00:23:53 The development of faith-based intentional communities with an exchange of commodities for value. Completely separate value from power. You asked, therefore you are given... This is just my humble opinion
270 2018-03-19 00:21:14 I'd have to do some intensive research to figure out how the commodities market is manipulated entirely. Suffice it to say that the price is manipulated. And there is the upfront cost for each company, the capacity per day, so many variables, all affected by markets.
271 2018-03-19 00:14:13 Also, though N. Dakota did experience a new oil boom, one they hoped would last as long as the  one in the 80s, the boom slowed as soon as the Saudis increased production, which put up to 1/3 of drillers out of biz by June of last year. Commodities are tough.

273 2018-03-19 00:13:02 Backfill agricultural commodities using a dedicated short bias to maximize the effects of the discount factor.
274 2018-03-19 00:10:25 No lo sé. Descartaría catch up y convergencia, dos factores clave en mucha literatura. No sé qué tan bien descarten cclos de commodities. Si bien todo es real, los predios influencian el stock de capital.

¿Qué dicen?
275 2018-03-19 00:02:59 Putin chegou ao governo numa situação econômica muito complicada da Rússia e depois pegou o boom de commodities. É como se os russos tivessem saído do lixo para um vida classe média. Sabem dos problemas autoritários dele, mas acho que pensam "ruim com ele pior sem ele".
