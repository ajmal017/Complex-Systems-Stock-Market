40 2018-10-15 23:57:53 2 reasons: 1. The GOP politicians are paid by the big oil and fossil fuel CEO’s. They must do as theyre told or said companies will pull their funding. 2. They are poisoned by religious belief that believes science contradicts the scripture.

59 2018-10-15 23:56:09 Jobs in Alberta have been suffering for years, that’s why I moved to BC. The oil tycoons out there COULD create new jobs by investing in renewable energy platforms. They simply choose not to.
60 2018-10-15 23:56:09 No it’s about oil.  He’s in a tough spot.  If he applies sanctions to Saudi, they’ll cut down on oil experts to us and our allies.  If he does nothing you will holler, but if gasoline goes up, you’ll holler more
61 2018-10-15 23:56:04 Olive oil or some other lubricant might have helped.
62 2018-10-15 23:56:00 i’m nervous asking my mom about using cbd oil
63 2018-10-15 23:55:57 They're sub-par plans. Sell your snake oil elsewhere, Douchey McDoucherson!
64 2018-10-15 23:55:55  Down with the G's now it's time for the laughter
 Oil is also an underlying factor
65 2018-10-15 23:55:52 Lavender essential oil helps too!
66 2018-10-15 23:55:52 Stop buying meat and dairy products 
These companies pollute more than the oil industry
You live in an age where you can survive without eating animals, so do it
If I can do it I KNOW you can.

72 2018-10-15 23:54:32 Khashoggi is a Saudi who escaped to the US and then went back and the king (with US intel approval)  offed him.  I see no impact on the US/Saudi oil trade nor arms trade deals.
73 2018-10-15 23:54:22 hey did you know
that um

so

climate change is good because
itll lower

74 2018-10-15 23:54:15 Came across this on my Timeline... How are they?? I have anxiety and im all paranoid to try cbd oil lol.
75 2018-10-15 23:54:14 US is the biggest producer of oil in the world and your oil is completely insignificant. US imports 4 times more oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia.
Also, if the US ever needs oil, we just invade your sand dunes and in a week's time, Saudi Arabia can call itself a democracy.

81 2018-10-15 23:53:49 We've all grown up together. Been friends for years. You go to the oil fields and think you're hot shit and drop everyone but like 2 people. Think you're better then everyone else. Don't forget the people who were always here for you when you needed someone.
82 2018-10-15 23:53:46 Also the same if Saudi causes $400 oil
83 2018-10-15 23:53:44 Oh BC will squish this as well AB isn't allowed to take care of their ppl. Kind of like the BC LNG line that exploded and they stop safe oil pipelines.
84 2018-10-15 23:53:33 Does Natural hair growth oil really work? I'm going bald dammit.

86 2018-10-15 23:53:25 Hemp Eucalyptus/peppermint  I bought some lip balm from a girl on Mercari a while back that was made w hemp oil & it was so good 
87 2018-10-15 23:53:19 #ElectricVehicles, no engine, transmission, spark plugs, fan belts, air filters, timing belts, or cylinder heads. Never needs oil changes, tuneups, or emissions checks. Brake pads go years without replacement too. Is why car dealers see EV's as threat to their service business.
88 2018-10-15 23:52:52 Btw, your ridiculous threat of $200 in yuan oil seems to forget that you no longer provide the U.S with even a SIGNIFICANT amount of its oil. Have fun screwing yourself and opec, we owe our energy independence to the last stunt y'all pulled!

91 2018-10-15 23:52:34 Saudi Arabia murdered a journalist. In response, they threaten higher oil prices.

In other words, we can murder who we want as long as you need gas.

Anyone else deeply concerned about that?
92 2018-10-15 23:52:25 One problem is oil - it goes into so many products or commerce, etc, that it's difficult to say w/precision. If someone has a decent read on products, cool. However...

98 2018-10-15 23:52:13 I think folks could be persuaded to commit to waivers of these kind. The real problem is the sanctions violating on oil, coal, etc by Russia and China that undermines the sanctions regime.

Need course correction Sir
104 2018-10-15 23:51:37 You are looking at one very evil man, who will use his country's oil to try to break the back of other countries for the oil there. Trump, Kushner, and other countries are crooked with the profits they make at the sake of murdered citizens and in the U.S, TAXPAYERS
105 2018-10-15 23:51:32 We now have the ability to easily wean ourselves off of oil based on the production we’ve created through horrible things like cracking but still now’s the time. This Saudi support must end

109 2018-10-15 23:51:08 If we benefit we should pay, but of course it's hard in practice to see the causal links. But I do agree with you in number of ways - military spending to wage war against poor people to steal their resources, corrupt politicians, hand outs to oil companies, tax dodging....

119 2018-10-15 23:50:26 But I know that the existence of the US Military is inconsistent with the continued existence of the human species, given how much CO2 it emits, oil it consumes, minerals it extracts, heavy capital it invests in, people it kills, & nuclear weapons it stocks.

134 2018-10-15 23:48:49 Buhari was the 1st governor of the NE he left the region with only 4 secondary schools, little wonder GBOKO HARAM found a fertile ground. Buhari was the oil minister who funded the FESTAC festival instead of developing Nig,Buhari was the guy who toppled our best democracy in 1984
135 2018-10-15 23:48:42 You can have a dream about riding a horse, or you can have a dream about drowning in oil!
136 2018-10-15 23:48:41 It’s funny because now there are so many oil wells in America we should just tell them to fuck off. But the huge national corporation still need to make transactions.
137 2018-10-15 23:48:30 Man how much oil is on his body
138 2018-10-15 23:48:10 I taught my brother how to do an oil change today now he thinks he’s a mechanic

140 2018-10-15 23:48:08 Amusing, watching the media trying to lay Saudi fanaticism and lack of respect for life at the feet of Trump. The State Execution of Khasoggi is but a mere footnote in the Political/Oil history of the Arab Middle East. The West should safeguard its interests. @oneillyatescbc

144 2018-10-15 23:47:51 I don’t know if that’s completely true that Manufacturing won’t return to UK post Brexit in future, in a world of rising Oil Prices. It has happened in parts of USA South as a result of Cheaper Fracked Gas Energy Prices. It is true to say it’s unlikely to happen anytime quickly

147 2018-10-15 23:47:12 Texas rammed #fracking down our throats sticking gas wells at our fence lines even when the neighbors said No. The oil and gas industry are rapists. Keep running those ridiculous ads, Ted, cause it’s helping build momentum for the #BlueWave that’s coming. 
148 2018-10-15 23:47:08 It's a crying shame that millennial have little to no appreciation for cars these days. Manual Transmission, changing your own oil, rotating tires, etc. The thrill of a fast car that isn't a boring SUV or 4-door....
149 2018-10-15 23:47:05 Oil sands is a pretty good back up
150 2018-10-15 23:47:04 You do realize with every vertical pad being drilled these companies are plugging and abandoning older vertical wells correct? As good as it sounds though we are so far away from even coming close to replacing oil and gas extraction. That’s just the reality.

154 2018-10-15 23:46:41 who has cooking oil?
155 2018-10-15 23:46:34 Best thing ever. Watermelon slice. Sprinkle with feta, olive oil, torn basil leaves, salt & pepper. JUST EAT IT. You’ll thank me.

161 2018-10-15 23:45:59 Tim - I'm just not seeing it. How do we get from having DNA evidence of NA heritage to "now I'm a wanna join your tribe". That didn't happen here. Why the 0-60 outrage. I'm not sure why the Cherokee's are get wound up although some in OK have oil interests.
162 2018-10-15 23:45:35 I am taking an olive oil bath. I have peaked and am now 100% true Sicilian

166 2018-10-15 23:45:16 Just curious. What should be done?  Go to war?  Stop buying their oil and raise prices for your economy?  Not sell weapons that others will sell?  Not a Saudi fan by any means but also believe US can’t definitively solve all the worlds problems.
167 2018-10-15 23:44:55 story time!!!

my brother was engaged to this girl, long story short she ended up cheating on him and broke things off a few weeks ago. my brother moved and got a job working in the oil fields and got his shit together, he knew his best decision was to get out of this town.
168 2018-10-15 23:44:48 ooh I like it even more knowing it's eucalyptus, I use mint + eucalyptus oil for headaches so the wispyness makes sense for its scent!
169 2018-10-15 23:44:40 Hahaha! The way Democrats are going down, soon enough they will discover oil. May GOd continue to bless President Donald Trump and direct his footsteps in the right direction which will enable him make America great again.

172 2018-10-15 23:44:13 Sitting here in Walmart getting my oil changed and while I’m waiting this white lately sitting here talking to me, I got my eye on one thing.. THIS BIG NASTY BOOGER hanging from the top of her nose.. like you don’t feel that.. I wanna say something but that’s so embarrassing..
173 2018-10-15 23:44:12 The problem with our ppl is, they will not minimize their oil consumption. State Govts must take proper measures to provide efficient public transport to reduce the consumption of oil.

180 2018-10-15 23:42:46 Mario bedsecu spot treatment then vitamin E oil and tea tree
181 2018-10-15 23:42:44 Heres a thought, oil is not renwable. Alberta should move away from empty, front loaded propaganda bs like this, and actually move towards long term sustainable renwable resource solutions.  My oil working friends who are layed off every 3 months would surely appreciate it!
182 2018-10-15 23:42:30 coconut oil me please
183 2018-10-15 23:42:17 Maybe funds from gas and oil may be related to @Scotttaylorva ‘s vote against stopping new leases on offshore drilling?  His advertisements do not match his voting record.  #VA02 #wearewatching

193 2018-10-15 23:41:25 Hey Trump, oil prices have DOUBLED under ur administration. Ur pals in UAE need to chill out. Most of us aren't rich, we can't afford to pay 2x as much for heating oil!

196 2018-10-15 23:40:55 Hi, are you aware that we cannot currently refine NZ oil in NZ. So your point ?
197 2018-10-15 23:40:53 Thanks! Please keep exposing the mind-boggling ignorance on this issue by the Conservatives! All the oil money in the world won't buy anyone a new planet. Even Conservatives should be able to grasp that.

205 2018-10-15 23:39:45 I don't think we are enriching other countries. They are doing that work by themselves. Oil not only supports dictatorships elsewhere in the world but apparently has a significant influence on our own democracy as indicated by the major lobbying done by the sector.
206 2018-10-15 23:39:15 so much vitamin e oil  omg

208 2018-10-15 23:39:13 Good morning everyone let’s get this 1 package(1/4 ounce) active dry yeast, 2-1/4 cups of warm water, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon salt, 2 tablespoons canola oil, and 6-1/4 - 6-3/4 cups of all purpose flour combined well and baked at 375 for 30-35 minutes.
209 2018-10-15 23:39:08 Keep hating....ur wack album dey discover oil
210 2018-10-15 23:39:00 Baby oil. Old trick we used in cross country to look tough in the cold with no tights. The smell is. It intimidating though. 
211 2018-10-15 23:38:59 I totally love you. Let me know if you come to Orlando. You are so smart and feisty and cool. I would def vote for you and crawl door to door through hot oil and razor blades to secure your base.

215 2018-10-15 23:38:47 We've been ignoring Saudi human rights abuses for years in exchange for oil and weapons sales and the idea that we need their support to stabilize the ME. 

I'd love to read a piece on why this is a bad exchange, and why we don't need Saudi Arabia's money or alliance in the ME.
216 2018-10-15 23:38:40 Oh. Fuck. No. My tax dollars, which go to building and maintaining those bases, aren't going to be used for the profit of the coal and oil industries, while they steadily screw average Americans in their quest for greater profits. Better find another plan, Fauntleroy.

220 2018-10-15 23:38:29 I’m curious about that when America exports more oil than it imports.

223 2018-10-15 23:38:17 Interesting. Oil seems to be associated with bad things everywhere. Just look at the USA. I don't think I am disparaging our corporate system. What I am saying is why does one corporate sector get so many concessions while others don't? We don't bail out small businesses.
224 2018-10-15 23:38:16 パスタ茹でて湯切りしたら、軽くoilかけても駄目？
225 2018-10-15 23:38:05 I was under the car #fordcortina all weekend and after the day I had today, I wish I was still under it. Maybe hitting my head on the oil pan 2 times had something to do with today. Going back under tonight so if you don't see me tomorrow, call the po-po. 
226 2018-10-15 23:38:03 Anyone with any economic investment sense knows you have to invest in ur most lucrative resource. That happens to be oil & people.  Right at the moment it will make us the most amount of money.  If you can’t be part of the solution ur part of the problem.
227 2018-10-15 23:38:02 my cbd oil arrived and i took it and i’m getting anxiety about NOT feeling as anxious as i’m used to I’M SHSKSKSKSL
228 2018-10-15 23:37:48 Why do we buy their oil?
229 2018-10-15 23:37:45 I used Oil, Garlic salt, honey light light mustard you can’t even see for the dressing
230 2018-10-15 23:37:30 I keep it about a week. It starts to turn color a little after that, its not bad but it doesn't look as good. I started making my own because I wanted olive oil mayo without sugar. I use extra light olive oil so it doesn't have the strong olive oil taste.
231 2018-10-15 23:37:30 US has their own oil more than all the oil in Saudi put together!
232 2018-10-15 23:37:27 EEM puts, tactical SPY puts, long John Deere calls, oil lotto calls.  You? I really like the John Deere play.
233 2018-10-15 23:37:24 Shop local, if you do, you could help buy a kiddos Christmas present, help with diapers, an oil change, fixing a flat tire, put food on their table. It's important.
234 2018-10-15 23:37:15 Almost too much money to count. The Saudis have the developed world over a barrel (of oil).
235 2018-10-15 23:37:14 Rogue Killers is ulterior fact for, mercenary, hit man, Assassin. Your President is throwing out things to distract fro the truth.

238 2018-10-15 23:36:39 Both have oil. 1 drops bombs on neighbor, bans women from driving & supports terrorism. Other simply wants to make life easier for poor by nationalizing its resources.  1is ally of U.S. Other is under economic sanctions by U.S.. 1 is Saudi Arabia & other is Venezuela. #Hypocrites
239 2018-10-15 23:36:35 Snake oil also very popular in this arena
240 2018-10-15 23:36:26 Yes correct, UK essentially runs a surplus in Services, not goods which is a lot of why Brexit happened, as all those Coal & old Industries Areas were the ones who voted Heavy for Brexit, not London. Reason Sterling is overvalued derives from Huge Investment flows from Oil Money
241 2018-10-15 23:36:23 When you go to the dealership to get your oil changed and leave with a new car..
242 2018-10-15 23:36:21 #SaudiArabia will not hesitate to use its only effective #oil card in retaliation to the #Western pressure. Indeed, such measures will literally destroy global markets, in particular #Asian market. Though #Saudi and #US companies are long-term concurrent, the #US export less oil
243 2018-10-15 23:36:21 My first point is correct. And I don't believe most people know that. John Oliver's piece on SA contained the statement that "we need Saudi oil"  Why?  Its 900,000 bpd. I'm open to explanations.

251 2018-10-15 23:35:49 1) We are not cuddling with Putin. US still has strict sanctions on Russia, we have deterred Germany and other EU countries from buying oil/natural gas from Russia (main income source for the country), and increased our security presence.
252 2018-10-15 23:35:41 Didn't Don Coreloene hide his mafia dealings behind an Italian olive oil shop?
253 2018-10-15 23:35:35 Their vast supplies of north sea oil? Their easy access to the UK market? Their use of the British pound as currency?
254 2018-10-15 23:35:31 According to liberals, Russia secretly controls the US, while, at the same time, the US is controlled by Saudi oil.

Liberals will say and do anything to avoid admitting that the US is run by its own racist capitalist class.
255 2018-10-15 23:35:31 Because they don't have oil money?
256 2018-10-15 23:35:22 Your government is about to admit it assinated a journalist and to exact revenge for this discovery, your petty king wants withhold oil production.  Can you say 3rd world dictatorship?
257 2018-10-15 23:35:21 Liberals don’t want us to build pipelines for natural gas or drill for oil in this country.
258 2018-10-15 23:35:20 How many saudies were involved in 9/11?? Now we know...but continue to kiss there asses?? For oil
259 2018-10-15 23:35:08 I @‘d you in it but you just toss them in the ingredients on a baking sheet drizzle with olive oil and roast in the oven on high heat
260 2018-10-15 23:35:06 I can’t believe people are STILL using coconut oil as a moisturizer. That shit just sits on top of your skin?? It’s clogging your pores??? What?????
261 2018-10-15 23:35:05 Does #SaudiArabia still have oil? Most of the 9/11 hijackers were from there? Osama Bin Laden is Saudi Arabian? They still have oil though? Got it. Nothing is going to change.
262 2018-10-15 23:34:50 I the mighty! Listen to oil in the water EP. I think you would like all of those songs. Especially hound and the fox and slow dancing forever.
263 2018-10-15 23:34:42 I am so grateful for evening primrose oil gel capsules. Oh my God.

266 2018-10-15 23:34:21 Tonight’s dinner was shrimp scampi sautéed in garlic and butter with smoked jalapeño oil, with peas, parsley, and pancetta for some delicious alliteration over linguini—because I love cooking for my wife. #homecook #eat #cook #food
267 2018-10-15 23:34:13 This is a neat thing. Every time  someone tries to live her values folks bring up the use of oil for travel. Usually I get asked about my 19 year old minivan and Helva (my Ford Edge). We would have got an electric car but I was afraid of dying in between Edmonton and Calgary
268 2018-10-15 23:34:11 I think the real politik of Iran and Oil prevails.

270 2018-10-15 23:34:02 It isn't only the aberrant display of cruelty of an absolute power, but how little its partners [democratic countries] will go when economic interests are involved.

274 2018-10-15 23:33:36 The way Democrats are going down, soon enough they will discover oil. Lol

277 2018-10-15 23:33:34 She is going to need liniment oil after all this day’s contortions.
278 2018-10-15 23:33:33 CSB: I had my 2 little boys (roughly Kindergarten and 2nd grade) dress as Saudi Oil millionaires. They carried old fashioned oil cans to collect their candy.
279 2018-10-15 23:33:22 I need to put coconut oil on my life , or my life in rice, either will do .
280 2018-10-15 23:33:17 Cananga odorata, known as the cananga tree, is a tropical tree that is native to Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is valued for the perfume extracted from its flowers, called ylang-ylang EE-lang-EE-lang, which is an essential oil used in aromatherapy
281 2018-10-15 23:33:17 These are a bunch of nitwits trying to pad their pockets by "pureza de sangre" tests that limit who gets oil drilling bucks...it's a big issue among Tribal Americans. Social opprobrium against white people w/ even a splash of indigenous ancestry were very real 50 years ago.
282 2018-10-15 23:33:01 the saudi's killed a saudi national on saudi soil (saudi embassy is saudi soil).  wtf can the world do to them?  is it a bad thing to do, of course.  but i don't see what anyone can do other than sanctions or boycotts....oh ya, the saudi's can make oil go to $200, GLWT

284 2018-10-15 23:32:54 No, it's because the stocks of all oil companies would crash if they weren't allowed to exploit the claims they have right now. Don't blame it on powerless dipshits.
285 2018-10-15 23:32:50 So they fall for the snake oil of socialism?  I think their parents should be ashamed for not giving them guidance and teaching them to identify liars and thieves...

288 2018-10-15 23:32:37 We buy far more oil from Canada than the Saudis.  The Saudi oil reserves have been rapidly depleting.  The problem is oil is traded as a commodity.  If the US would somehow figure a way to take it off the commodity exchange prices would stabilize.
289 2018-10-15 23:32:29 Just took Benadryl, 5-HTP, started diffusing lavender oil, and about to rub lavender lotion on my entire body.

Am I calm yet
290 2018-10-15 23:32:25 Just like Idi Amin fleeing Uganda and living out his life out in KSA. Rotten to the core. Oil and a dying planet smoking and flooding away.
291 2018-10-15 23:32:20 Max, would you have traded supply management for a world price on Alberta oil with the States in the USMCA?
292 2018-10-15 23:32:19 That’s all right then.
Glad they cleared it up - we can now go on buying there oil to destroy the planet and in return selling them arms to kill Yemeni civilians with a clear conscience.
293 2018-10-15 23:32:11 Lower oil to $5.00 a barrel and we'll look the other way..
294 2018-10-15 23:31:52 I only do my most boring work at hockey practice.  

Which leads to documents about how "oil fills the void". 

I get more sympathetic to former authors every revision I make.
295 2018-10-15 23:31:49 Moving to renewables means less oil imported and reduces emissions and helps our balance of trade. Win win
296 2018-10-15 23:31:46 If Scotland had voted Yes in #Indyref, then there would have been people arguing against it all the way, especially when the oil price fell. Most likely, many of those would be the same people claiming the "will of the people" now. And that was a referendum with a clear plan!

300 2018-10-15 23:31:28 1) Not in the Med. He has no access there from Russia, nor does Russia have the people to mount a sustained fight with constant insurrections in the Middle East. Not to mention the world over would go to war specifically to keep the oil moving in the global market.

310 2018-10-15 23:30:33 In the case of Ms. Berman, of course she is living her values. Even if she has to bend this matter to travel as does every single human being who would like us to be responsible about emissions. Using energy like oil doesn't negate her living her values IMO. Of course you may be.

331 2018-10-15 23:28:23 Also Putin would take advantage by spiking price of oil.
332 2018-10-15 23:28:12 i could fry karaage with the amount of oil my face is currently producing
333 2018-10-15 23:28:09 Possibly, but they are the exception, going against the grain of Labour’s general national indifference to active travel.
I’d rather support a party that had that as a core principle, than fight to turn the Labour oil tanker.

337 2018-10-15 23:27:17 They don't even bother to pretend anymore. They are beholden to gas and oil.
338 2018-10-15 23:27:16 Ok oil is more than just dead dinosaur . It’s other animals and plants the under the right conditions turn to oil.

340 2018-10-15 23:26:45 Could be if the Saudis cut oil production. Supremely ironic!!
341 2018-10-15 23:26:41 Due to our close relationship with US, 
we are giving them the privilege while the higher revenue for Saud Arabia is exporting our oil to the East (mainly, China, Japan and India) ..

344 2018-10-15 23:26:12 How are we going to pay for our very real oil wars then? 
345 2018-10-15 23:26:12 In the first 100 days jt gave away 5.3 billion dollars to socialist groups all over the world. Who has to pay for that.

357 2018-10-15 23:24:46 Scott Taylor voted against the Pingree Amendment, which would have banned new leases for offshore drilling off our coast for 5 years. Taylor voted against #VA02's interests, siding with the Gulf of Mexico. He took $51,905 from oil/gas companies this year.
358 2018-10-15 23:24:42 I respect all of that.

362 2018-10-15 23:24:25 the fact i almost had to pay 70 dollars for a oil change is not right
363 2018-10-15 23:24:09 And because of Shale oil, America is actually NOW the THIRD globally in oil production.  
When I found out how much oil was in Fracking I understood immediately why Saudi was funding environmental NGO's.  OF COURSE.   We now are self reliant and don't need Middle East Oil.

368 2018-10-15 23:23:47 I just saw a commercial of Ted Cruz where he bashes on Beto O'Rourke because he wants to add a tax to oil and is against fossil fuel consumption and wants to focus on renewable energy sources, and if that doesn't speak volumes to you I don't know what will.
369 2018-10-15 23:23:46 And what political party would that be exactly? The oils hungry, war mongers Democrats? Or the republicans? Bottom line, all parties are at the mercy of big oil. Otherwise we wouldn’t be using oil anymore.
370 2018-10-15 23:23:44 Olbas oil is the shit
371 2018-10-15 23:23:39 That seems about right. They want the Russian weapons systems, and trade oil in the yuan, all of which are pissing off the the US.

373 2018-10-15 23:23:34 Do you think WV Roads are in major disrepair, too many hillside slips & Big Oil should pay their fair share?  Should big oil pay more than 5% tax on the fuel they extract from WV? If so, then you need to get out and vote! 
Vote 4 Zukoff & Canestraro & hold big oil accountable
374 2018-10-15 23:23:29 I am against offshore drilling and will oppose indefinitely. A major oil spill could be catastrophic to our region and to the already endangered and fragile waters of the Bay. These risks far outweigh any potential gain from offshore drilling. #VA02

377 2018-10-15 23:23:05 I understand your point. However, I worked on oil rigs, where grisly accidents and deaths happen.  People joked about it. Tension relief. Gallows humor. No one actually thought someone getting their fingers crushed was funny.

Could ask at my local dealership but they'd expect me to pay £35 for their smallest bottle...

386 2018-10-15 23:22:37 I thought we really didn't need their oil anyway.

394 2018-10-15 23:21:30 Salt is your friend now! MCT oil is medium chain triglycerides and it's quicker to digest than most other fats so you get energy from it quicker. It's made from coconut oil if I'm not mistaken
395 2018-10-15 23:21:23 I don't like how immediately after returning home from the grocery store in part to get olive oil, I am confronted with ads for olive oil. If this isn't strictly coincidence, how the heck did my social media apps fet wise to my purchase just now?
396 2018-10-15 23:21:18 Waiting for explanation of journalist murder and hope to see his body in full. What if Turkey never asked about him? Will this government level political murder, possibly torture, lead to sanctions? Will oil magic, petrocash holdings and allies privilege prevail? #JamalKhashoggi
397 2018-10-15 23:20:59 If we go to Saudi Arabia take the oil this time

399 2018-10-15 23:20:44 I told my mom and found out she suffers from it too lmao. So she actually told me about taking krill oil and stuff. Thank you for helping!!
400 2018-10-15 23:20:42 So Saudis invest in Trump properties...middle eastern oil saves "666" ....and now we hear another crafted statement from Donny!  Where is the Republicans conscience?

403 2018-10-15 23:20:20 "The way we're seeing it is long dated oil prices are rising, the front-end is weakening which is telling you that hey, we don't have a problem today, we potentially have a problem tomorrow."

404 2018-10-15 23:20:15 Good, our government won't. Our government has a long history of allowing Saudi to do what they want and now we are so dependent on oil Saudi can have a huge effect on the world economy.

408 2018-10-15 23:19:46 No, I'm saying that reliance on oil is a reality and will be for at least 100 years. Whilst moves should be made towards other fuels, such as nuclear, it is simple fact that we need these resources and therefore reducing dependence on imports is one strand.
409 2018-10-15 23:19:44 oh ! fuck ! shit ! bitch ! the oil POPPIN poppin
410 2018-10-15 23:19:40 World leaders will be heaving sighs of relief over the #saudi 'explanation' - 'Phew, that's sorted then ? Back to selling arms & buying oil ! ' #Khashoggi
411 2018-10-15 23:19:18 @cathmckenna, when are you going to get it? Real action means leaving fossil fuels in the ground. We can’t eat oil, or money. Plants don’t grow past 35°.  This is an existential threat; it literally threatens our existence. We are entering the 6th mass extinction, w/o action.

414 2018-10-15 23:18:50 What is curious to me is that the oil industry has not developed this technology but left it to the railway companies. So odd. You would think they would want to improve their image but nope. We will have a refinery in AB soon. It's been a major money pit. @AuditorGenAB
415 2018-10-15 23:18:45 Fought my people to destroy the land for oil it’s fine I’m fine

Oh ho ho very funny. Put my old oil back in my car, I ain’t paying for this shit.

428 2018-10-15 23:17:10 Found these little pods in the drugstore that have clove & coconut oil in them. Seemed to work on my little teether. Plus great smelling breath. Baltic amber is supposed to work as well.
429 2018-10-15 23:17:06 Fusion, wind, solar, hydroelectric energy and Geothermal power are the future.  And this is not a liberal issue but a issue of one industry (oil) trying to dominate all others and pollute our planet to extinction in the process. It's called corporatism.
430 2018-10-15 23:16:46 They have all the oil so wee hands don is never going to upset them. Nobody will be charged for this murder. Saudis do what they want, which includes funding extreme Islamic terrorism.

442 2018-10-15 23:15:57 That’s really cool dude we only got one free oil change!
443 2018-10-15 23:15:57 That's actually not true, Saudi Arabia's economy is only a fraction of Canada's. USA imports more oil from Canada than any other country. Canada has 3rd largest oil reserves in the world, under Venezuela and Saudi. 
Saudi is vulnerable, 75% of their revenue is oil.
444 2018-10-15 23:15:55 You have to agree that taking off the table the possibility of selling Canadian oil and gas to other countries didn't help our negotiating position.  And it's indisputable the US is the beneficiary of the below market prices ($50b/yr at current prices).
445 2018-10-15 23:15:49 Mr. Khashoggi was murdered. End of story. It does not take a police inspector to draw that conclusion. I am concerned however that due to oil being what it is; his life (and death) will have meant nothing at all.
446 2018-10-15 23:15:30 Ya they’re made from palm oil. I eat whole bags too. When does impulse control kick in?
447 2018-10-15 23:15:28 Pompeo will help the barbarism of  Saudis make there story believe . They always be like that. No brain and hypocrite, There money oil won t change that
448 2018-10-15 23:15:27 Is it weird, or is it a consistent position of total indifference to human well being, rooted in the American government Faustian bargain of weapons for oil and total political cover?
449 2018-10-15 23:15:20 I guess casino and golf courts. But soon this hokus pokus is over. No oil no money no weapons zero interest.
450 2018-10-15 23:15:17 And yet oil revenue supports dictatorships around the world (by many accounts Putin is the richest man in the world through oil wealth). When we disparage our open corporate system and enrich other oil countries we are hurting their citizens, not very global.
451 2018-10-15 23:15:17 @Kris_Sacrebleu Trump -"will be severe consequences" for Saudi Arabia if the kingdom ordered #Kashoggi 's torture & murder. Translation -Trump & Saudi's will put heads together,find & offer up a patsy and then move on. After all, is silly to let this interfere with $ and oil.....
452 2018-10-15 23:15:14 They cancelled drivers ed when I was in school. But I did learn how to change my own oil thanks to my big brother in law! Had to learn tires because I worked at gas station. All else was home ec! But I do love the idea. My boys don’t want to learn sew or iron.

461 2018-10-15 23:14:50 Just had the weirdest experience. In the supermarket listening to my music on shuffle (1000s of tracks on my phone). Beds are Burning by midnight oil plays. The moment it finishes the same song starts on the supermarket speakers. 

What are the odds?

489 2018-10-15 23:12:11 We certainly don't need their oil anymore. We should sever ties with KSA as our relationship with them has cost the lives of many Americans. However, as they are an ally of Israel in opposing Iran's hegemony in the region, I doubt the US pro Israel lobby will allow that.
490 2018-10-15 23:12:06 The government of America are already trying to cripple us, who cares about Saudi oil. I would be more worried about our fake leader letting Saudis in our country, as far as Iran, that is just a death trap for our young men and women, as Russia and China will enter for their 3rd.
491 2018-10-15 23:11:58 It's because of transport gridlock that causes barrel on barrel competition until the localized market clears. 

I think Canadians have among if not the best standards in the world and the rest of the world would prefer our oil and gas if they could just get it.

495 2018-10-15 23:11:13 The US is an oil producer now. And those government subsidized solar factories never produced anything other than kickbacks to politicians.

504 2018-10-15 23:10:23 To cut it short. If the whole world came together and decided to increase oil production to fill in the gab Saudi Arabia will make they wouldn’t even get close to 10 million barrel a day. But you are too ignorant to know this.

510 2018-10-15 23:10:12 I do agree I picked a pretty green picture and that this below a typical seasonal average of circa 280. However even this with a cautious SPF of 2.8 gives emissions of 100 kWh. Almost a 3rd of oil and 50% of Nat Gas. No brainer.

512 2018-10-15 23:10:01 I stopped using heat on it, try to wash my hair as infrequently as possible, I use argon oil + jojoba oil on it, I rinse with cool water before I get out of the shower, I use a comb instead of a brush, and I get a trim every 2 months or so!

520 2018-10-15 23:08:39 Never throw oil and matches in a river! And shit happens when you share your lake with Canada!
521 2018-10-15 23:08:37 “Free SHS is ensuring that our oil revenues are being equitably distributed to our people, and not ending up in the pockets of a few.  The most important resource of any nation is its people.”-@NAkufoAddo #TheChangeWeVotedFor #UKGhanaInvestmentSummit2018 #FreeSHSIsHere

523 2018-10-15 23:08:25 The @YourAlberta cannot sustain work based on gambling revenues alone. It is getting some rev from oil; will be helped by marijuana and other sin taxes (tobacco). Oil and gas revenues need to be balanced by costs. What will be future costs to remediate the env if this is doable?
524 2018-10-15 23:08:24 Hi awak, can. Castor oil to aloe vera 2:1 hehe
525 2018-10-15 23:08:08 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
526 2018-10-15 23:08:06 Sooo, i go change my oil today after a whole year of not changing it, lol, to find out that i have to buy 2 brand new tires bc the ones i have are in critical condition.. RIP to my tires, my bank account and my soul 
527 2018-10-15 23:07:58 I'd rather subsidize a solar startup than spend billions upon billions of dollars on our military because we're dependent on oil that happens to come from the most unstable region on Earth.
528 2018-10-15 23:07:53 Pecans, Gorilla Glue tape, extra strength oregano oil.
529 2018-10-15 23:07:34 No,  we are clear that you can genuinely sponsor genocide in #SouthernCameroon and pretend as if nothing is happening while you & @theresa_may will sign oil deals with the dictatorship of @PR_PaulBiya via @NewAge.  #GenocideInSouthernCameroons
530 2018-10-15 23:07:33 Today, I think the biggest reason to vote blue in November is the administration's willingness to cover up murder because the Saudis sell us oil and stay in Trump hotels. Let's not let our moral beacon completely go out. #KeepAmericaGreat #darkdays #vote
531 2018-10-15 23:07:32 •SKIN CARE•
•baking soda+coconut oil,coconut oils makes your skin soft and removes dirt from your skin,baking soda=exfoliator
• coconut oil and salt
•2 tablespoons of oats and less than half a cup of water and 2 tablespoons of coconut oil, 1 tablespoon of  honey
532 2018-10-15 23:07:28 & all the GOP & trump want to do is take their land drill for oil and pollute their waters yep
533 2018-10-15 23:07:03 100年振りに一限間に合う時間に動いてるけど電車内で人権を失って、やはり一限はｺﾞﾐだと再認識した
534 2018-10-15 23:06:51 Reminder that coconut oil is the greatest
535 2018-10-15 23:06:49 In Germany we're discussing "no weapons for Saudi Arabia" since... since... since forever. Great arguments for weapon deals are always money, jobs and of course oil. I am sure you know this dilemma.
536 2018-10-15 23:06:42 Oil need a new goalie coach
537 2018-10-15 23:06:38 Well I guess Ms. Berman has been about the world as I have and seen the impact of First World unlimited growth politics and policies on the Third World. It's not pretty. I think the current realities are that we make more money from gambling than oil @OilGasCanada
538 2018-10-15 23:06:38 Pot calling kettle black there. JLR is from the Whale Oil arm of the National Party.
539 2018-10-15 23:06:31 ... the US offshore and Canada. #Trump told you that our relationship is based on arms not oil. He is concerned about $$$$$$$$$$ and his holdings the Saudis fund. Why do you think they stay in his hotel in Washington and over pay? Don't be naive, follow the money
540 2018-10-15 23:05:46 Ouch virgin oil burn

542 2018-10-15 23:05:35 Story time: i ordered cbd oil for the first time and it was supposed to come in last friday and it didn’t. I go into the post office saturday and the guy there says they dont have it there so im peeved. (1/2)
543 2018-10-15 23:05:29 The uses coconut oil as lube thing kinda threw me tho

546 2018-10-15 23:05:13 @AUWCL Assistant Dean Bill Snape discusses the disproportionate siting of California oil drills in communities of color. @ABA_CRSJ @auwclEnvLaw
547 2018-10-15 23:05:08 Yeah and not feeding hungry children is  just stupid like trying to save money on auto ownership by not buying oil when the oil pressure light comes on.
548 2018-10-15 23:04:58 How right you were.  I thought much the same and what a different position we could have been in by now but for the oil lobby
549 2018-10-15 23:04:58 An interrogation that went WRONG, by a regime that's doing WRONG, in a country that's WRONG in every aspect of human rights. However when it comes to Saudi oil, the price is RIGHT.
550 2018-10-15 23:04:55 Castor Oil has been growing my hair.
551 2018-10-15 23:04:53 Let's get #AmericanOil flowing freely again. If #Saudi_Arabia is going to warn the US about $200/barrel oil, we will be prepared.  #khashoggi
552 2018-10-15 23:04:50 Hey, I am getting pennies on the $100s with these tax cuts. Add to this the rising interest rates and increase in commodities like crude oil and you’ve got an economy that is actually less affordable than pre Trump... but hey, when you aren’t looking at the complexity...
553 2018-10-15 23:04:46 y’all imma be honest, my skin is doing SO GOOD RN like i have no break outs, it’s soft & my oil is at bay & i ain’t gonna lie i think it’s cause i ain’t worrying about justin 25/8 he livin his best live & now i’m livin mine
554 2018-10-15 23:04:45 If you nerds wanna know what’s real good, toss your popcorn with a little olive oil, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder and BOOM, we got your metabolism all revved up AND no one will kiss you. Win win baby.
555 2018-10-15 23:04:43 Sick Hack; you don't have to go outside to get garbage food, you can make a ton of French fries in your own home if you have potatoes, oil, seasoning, an oven, and no self respect
556 2018-10-15 23:04:42 lol how does okponglo kelewele taste different? Is the plantain special or the oil they use to fry
557 2018-10-15 23:04:33  that’s crap drink oil and stay safe let me know how u get on 
558 2018-10-15 23:04:13 Me: This is so bad. There are smudges all over your screen and the oil buildup
559 2018-10-15 23:04:11 Oil of oregano! Nasty but effective. (Hope you're well enough to attend Greg Younging's talk next Tuesday...)
560 2018-10-15 23:04:07 Such an amazingly talented driver!
561 2018-10-15 23:04:03 All five living ex-presidents are completely silent on Trump's North Korea Summit. Maybe they're wondering how a non-politician, common sense businessman did more in 500 days than they did in 30 years, so we will take your snake oil, it works.
562 2018-10-15 23:04:02 Or it would merely redirect the guff and snake oil.
563 2018-10-15 23:04:01 I have no loyalty to the @OilGasCanada or the environmental movement. I do have an interest in the world. I think growth cannot be sustained by the world. It's getting late in the day. Some of us must be sensible even if the rest of them aren't. Start with us. Leave oil in ground
564 2018-10-15 23:03:56 Chinas building more fossil fuel plants because they have a green plan. Saudi same thing but shipping oil everywhere ships use bunker fuel. Venezuela ships more oil. India more fossil fuel plants. But Canada shut it down. Really what about the EU? UK? Iran? What are they doing?
565 2018-10-15 23:03:56 Why doesn't AB diversify? It's been oil, oil, oil for over 70 years. We have a new urgency -  climate chaos - and we have little time to address it.
566 2018-10-15 23:03:50 Congrats DezRT.                                    Hope the’re giving youTilray oil..  its working a treat for me!
567 2018-10-15 23:03:43 It's nice that Warren found out about the ancestry that makes her related to the water protectors she threw under a bus when their actual graves were being dug up to poison their water with oil. I'm sure it's all good now. #tytlive
568 2018-10-15 23:03:38 わかりみしかない
569 2018-10-15 23:03:38 Nothing to see here! The the Saudi's are nothing but murdering lying dirty terrorists with money!  I can't fuckin wait until we don't need their oil!  They are evil inside out! I hope they are enjoying their lives here on earth because they will burn in hell! Never forget 911!
570 2018-10-15 23:03:33 Spent the morning under my dads Jeep XJ diagnosing the mystery oil leak. Hardline crimp join the hose on return transmission line the culprit. Time to remove the hardline and  recrimp. #jeeplife
571 2018-10-15 23:03:30 Research? I am an engineer and i work in the largest oil company in the world. But ok, lets hear it from you mr.oil market expert. Name a group of countries that can fill in the gab of over 10 million barrel of Saudi oil per day to prevent the prices from rocketing.
572 2018-10-15 23:03:22 3 - Everyone noticed after the visit of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques to Russia and how was the signing of the deal S-400 and the rapprochement of Saudi Arabia's historic oil with a permanent one day after the visit,
573 2018-10-15 23:03:22 If that’s the case then going green for western countries will be the route to take out of their hands the oil manipulation leverage, right ?
574 2018-10-15 23:03:19 Found olive oil on sale for 1/2 the usual price & said “fuck, yeah” to myself in the grocery store
575 2018-10-15 23:03:06 My car is definitely being needy this week. A new tire, oil change, filter change and now my belts
576 2018-10-15 23:02:58 Good. Maybe people will STOP driving so much and work for inexpensive public transit. #KeepItInTheGround #SaudiArabia #Oil @POTUS #StopKillingOurJournalists @realDonaldTrump
577 2018-10-15 23:02:55 Does the tractor have an oil cooler ?
578 2018-10-15 23:02:46 Remember the Deep Water Horizon oil spill?
You know, the worst environmentaly destructive oil spill in HISTORY?
Remember when the Obama  Administration legislated that ALL oil rigs in US waters have Oil Spill Leak Prevention?
tRump just rolled that requirement back.
FKG MORON!!!
579 2018-10-15 23:02:29 Now on this line, "the left in this country needs to allow us to start energy production here, so that we are not beholden to the Saudis and other OPEC nations for our energy." This is a #GOP talking point. You do know this is not the 70's we get most of our oil from.......
580 2018-10-15 23:02:17 Doesn’t essential peppermint oil really work for your hair? I just copped a small bottle.
581 2018-10-15 23:02:09 Abolish oil companies and imprison their officials.

583 2018-10-15 23:01:43 Olive oil is lower in fat than other oils and also offers many nutritional benefits, as it is rich in antioxidants. In terms of taste, olive oil is also richer and more flavorful than other kinds of cooking oil.
584 2018-10-15 23:01:33 We all have Native American in us, THEY CAME FROM AFRICA HERITAGE WHO ADAPTED TO THE CLIMATE AND DIET OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS, CORN SILK, CORN OIL, ACCOUNTS FOR OUR HAIR, SNOW AND LOW SUNLIGHT LIGHTEN OUR SKIN

586 2018-10-15 23:01:22 You all know who owns the largest oil refinery in the United States, yes?
587 2018-10-15 23:01:14 No they’re AMAZING I stan SR... good genes, tidal cream and Juno/Luna oil are amazing
588 2018-10-15 23:01:12 There is no rule that requires unlimited growth. We can stop growth and keep the oil in the ground. I fail to see why it is a good thing to produce more oil when the world is awash in fracking oil. Surely the fracking boom in the USA is meeting the demand? Why add to it?
589 2018-10-15 23:00:59 my version of self care is rubbing coconut oil over my almost bald head to soothe the burns i got from bleaching it
590 2018-10-15 23:00:54 Love candles....tobacco patchouli oil 
591 2018-10-15 23:00:54 Do I have to plug the leaves? I refuse, too much plucking! I can just put in shallow container, cover (or coat?) in olive oil, then just store where?
592 2018-10-15 23:00:52 CBD oil. You can also get it in liquid form and use in a vape, really helps me

597 2018-10-15 23:00:28 Betul, if rasa muka tu combi, elak yg hydrating ni, go for yg balancing oil moisturiser tu. I tried both sbb i g try starter kit tu. Yang hydrating will surely buat muka rasa mcm minyak gila after like an hour gitu
598 2018-10-15 23:00:03 Rick you can invest in oil and benefit from higher oil prices ! That's the beauty of it anyone can participate
599 2018-10-15 23:00:03 Yep, it’s the biggest snake oil sale in history
600 2018-10-15 22:59:56 Is it because our oil is dirty?
601 2018-10-15 22:59:53 What do U want him to do? Destabilize oil/crash the economy? 1,000+ journalists killed in the past 4 years and over 300 missing, this is the 1 liberals care about? What R y’all trying to distract from? Why did he fly to Turkey with a consulate avail near his workplace in the US?
602 2018-10-15 22:59:39 はぁい
603 2018-10-15 22:59:38 I read about using olive oil as herbs have oil in them, so it made sense to me. And dry it too! So much 'fresher' than what you get at the store.
604 2018-10-15 22:59:33 Petrochemicals feed stock like ethylene and propylene can also be produced directly by cracking crude oil WITHOUT the need of using refined products of crude oil such as naphtha.
605 2018-10-15 22:59:24 @ChrisDanielShow there is an oil pipeline from Bako to Moro Bay!
606 2018-10-15 22:59:23 And what is wrong with leaving the oil in the ground? These are assets our kids can use if innovations do improve the situation. Unfortunately I doubt other nations interested in being responsible. Money is ultimately the main interest of all nations. USA is not responsible.
607 2018-10-15 22:59:11 It wasn't about stealing Iraqi oil it was about forcing them to sell oil for US dollars rather than Euros. Educate yourself on the petrodollar system.
608 2018-10-15 22:59:01 oil changes do wonders
609 2018-10-15 22:58:57 The fashion industry is the most polluting industry on Earth, second only to oil according to the documentary The True Cost...
610 2018-10-15 22:58:56 I thought Nick Timothy had buggered off to oil his thigh-length leather jackboots in peace after ballsing up the 2017 election. The only thing missing from that pathetic screed is cobblers about two world wars and one world cup. Inflammatory drivel, typical of the Sun.
611 2018-10-15 22:58:45 They used to teach home ec.
Sewing, cooking, laundry, budgeting and the like.
Now they teach feminine studies.
They also had Auto Mechanics 1,2 and 3.
In A.M.1 they taught oil/tire changes and other basics.
Now you have to go to a “technical school”
What happened to civics class?
612 2018-10-15 22:58:41 Oil refinery or petroleum refinery is an industrial process plant where crude oil is transformed and refined into more useful products such as petroleum naphtha, gasoline, diesel fuel, asphalt base, heating oil, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas, jet fuel and fuel oils.
613 2018-10-15 22:58:39 @cathmckenna - Then stop subsidizing oil & gas and financing carbon & methane-emitting projects and use THAT money toward the ever rising cost of climate change transition, re-training etc.

616 2018-10-15 22:58:23 They could buy Russian arms, but none of their current defence mechanisms are set up to accomodate Russian systems. To change them over would take years and money they don’t actually have if they’re also trying to invest in a new non oil based economy.
617 2018-10-15 22:58:19 Ok. Which country has the capacity to meet up with your oil demands ? No one! Thus oil will hit $200 per barrel and Saudi will still sell 7 M barrels / day to Asia, Africa and Europe. Saudi will make more money. And you will pay way more at the gaz pump

622 2018-10-15 22:57:39 Oil Price Forecast: Higher Highs & Lows Spur Shift in Retail Interest: The recent rebound in oil spurs a shift in retail interest, but the broader outlook no longer remains constructive as the bullish trend from August unravels.

628 2018-10-15 22:57:10 Haha so I was just about to fry some plantains for brunch like a girl does on a Monday afternoon, the oil had just been poured but wasn’t hot enough so I got on my phone for a bit and then my dog somehow yanked me toward her and then my hair just sort of fell in the oil and yeah
629 2018-10-15 22:57:09 How did the CBD oil go?
630 2018-10-15 22:57:07 For 45 years the Saudis kept telling the Muslim world that "using the oil threat to defend al-Quds is unthinkable" now when it comes to defending their own interests they suddenly find justification for issuing an oil threat!?

635 2018-10-15 22:56:51 @FinancialReview 1. I can't find any information about this being any kind of well known scam but I just got a robo-call claiming to be from the Financial Review wanting to talk to me about crude oil and how I can benefit from purchasing it.
636 2018-10-15 22:56:51 If you think the fire nation hasn't attacked us yet, think again! 

Our technology is mostly made out of oil, forest fires, and the suffering of the poor.

642 2018-10-15 22:56:16 So let me see...the US oil companies but Canadian oil, from themselves, for peanuts...refine it then sell it back to the consumer at market. Sounds legit. Now why would US oil companies want a pipeline?
643 2018-10-15 22:56:05 For those of us old enough to remember, the oil companies promised us oil independent if they could have the Alaskan pipeline. Afterwards they decided too much sulfur. They could refine but don't want to spend money. Us back to mercy of Middle East
644 2018-10-15 22:56:02 This is why canada should refine our own oil instead of buying saudi oil .
645 2018-10-15 22:55:57 So I finally got to eat Randy Waters boiled pnuts, Randy's Nutz, off Racetrack Rd the other day.

A "10"

Truly damn fine cajun pnuts, chick full of real peppers, carrots, and I'm thinking added pnut or olive oil...

 pull over for dese nuts :)
646 2018-10-15 22:55:52 All those teams wouldn't have succeeded without the oil money.  man United doesn't need a piece of that.   The glazers just need to find a balance with whatever they are doing.   We don't need their funds.
647 2018-10-15 22:55:48 I loved in Maine where it gets cold, the oil company decided to NOT DELIVER oil AGAIN so we have no hot water AGAIN!

Just COME ON DO YOUR FREAKING JOB!
648 2018-10-15 22:55:45 Oil still looks like one more leg up left bouncing off some support “so far"
649 2018-10-15 22:55:38 SA had human rights issues for decades, but little has been done, because SA controls so much of oil and wealth.

651 2018-10-15 22:55:23 Lots of cheap oil up here in Canada!
652 2018-10-15 22:55:23 The West coast needs to collectively shut down the fossil fuel industry here. No more pipelines, export facilities, oil by rail, new extraction, etc. The planet is rapidly warming and with feedback loops time is running out to prevent calamity.

654 2018-10-15 22:54:31 2/2 The Cherokee Nation knows that. But they are right that emphasizing that there are people of Indian descent who are not on the rolls can result in “undermining tribal interests.” Oil money, casino money, and property rights are all involved.

656 2018-10-15 22:54:20 Imagine how freeing it would be to no longer be dependent on oil and we could stop pretending that Saudi Arabia has anything in common with us. 

Let's be more like the USA we know we can be than the Saudi Arabia that currently is. 

We can start by getting rid of Trump & Kushner
657 2018-10-15 22:54:14 Ok genius. Can you then explain how oil prices rocketed in the 80s when 1 country (Saudi Arabia) decided to stop oil production? No oil in the world can fill the gab if the Saudis decided to boycott he market. Not even mentioning Saudi allys in the Arab world.

662 2018-10-15 22:53:34 Man. Get your facts straight. US is now able to be entirely self sufficient with the oil that we produce. We sell it offshore. Could stop that any time if we chose. If we live in fear of what saudis will do we are no longer most powerful nation.

671 2018-10-15 22:52:48 The oil and gas industry isn't subsidized.
672 2018-10-15 22:52:43 Like I said the if Saudi Arabia raise the price of oil all other countries will do the same

680 2018-10-15 22:52:16 Probably with the aim of starving investment in those means of energy production.  they can afford to waste billions of dollars so they make money off their oil production.
681 2018-10-15 22:52:15 Lol sure. At least you're soft to the touch. You still using baby oil?
682 2018-10-15 22:52:07 Tattooed friends, any tips for healing a burn on top of a tattoo and preventing damage? 

I had some hot cooking oil splash onto my arm, right plop in the middle of a detailed color piece. Not a bad burn, but I can already see some damage after <30 minutes.
683 2018-10-15 22:51:58 I appreciate the little things like my mom putting oil on my scalp today. I think she misses doing my hair.
684 2018-10-15 22:51:57 doh.  The truckies said it...saw it..common sense if put petrol up..oil seeps thru whole economy!!!!
685 2018-10-15 22:51:50 Big money needs to step in and pay Madison Ave to dedign a simple ad campaign to educate normal ppl about the dangers of the warming earth.  Enough with the nonsense. Tobacco companies lie. Oil companies lie. Ppl lie to make money.
686 2018-10-15 22:51:46 Germany, Japan, Italy, United Kingdom and France consumes  lower oil  today then way back  in 1974. They learned their lessons from First Oil Shock of 70s. Something to learn from them about oil  demand management.

699 2018-10-15 22:50:15 The challenge in Calgary, is that oil companies are taking advantage of the bad news, laying people off as it fits the narrative, and making the survivors pick up the slack, as they should feel grateful for keeping their jobs.  Oil companies aren't suffering as much as workers.

706 2018-10-15 22:49:50 To do this they may have decided the only way will be a chemical attack like Iraq/Libya and previously Syria and blame it on ISIS. US fighting ISIS only for the oil fields in Syria so they will happily obliterate them and that destroys any possible recourse or evidence.
707 2018-10-15 22:49:45 She say they got rid of a clause undermining Canadian energy? Well the liberal gov is doing just fine on there own doing that,also got rid of a clause that US companies can’t sue Canada 4 millions, while we loose over 40 million a day on oil discount.

Second: they are talking about the prices of oil because if Saudi Arabia raise the prices every other country will do the same.
Third: even US can’t miss with SA.
714 2018-10-15 22:49:23 I am asking you why your leaders are so rich, how did they earn their money? Oil? So they sell oil from your country and puts the money into their own pockets? Wow, that must make you really proud how they steal money from the country. Here they would be thrown in jail for theft.
715 2018-10-15 22:49:22 Yep! Soros killed Hitler to run the concentration camps himself for kicks when he was young.
Only dark money from the oil companies or funnelled through the nra is cool in my books.

729 2018-10-15 22:47:45 We'll find out if OIL is thicker than BLOOD. My bet is they'll over look the BLOOD and focus on the OIL.

774 2018-10-15 22:43:36 Yes, Yes I am.... directly anointed by a large angel with very warm oil. It was an experience I will never forget and always honor what I've been called to do.

780 2018-10-15 22:43:24 #SAUDI: Introducing non-US dollar oil contracts, decreasing oil production, and liquidating US investments 'all viable options,' @EurasiaGroup says, 'in the unlikely event' of US sanctions. 'Riyadh would begin strategically reorienting away from the US toward Russia and China'
781 2018-10-15 22:43:21 ohhh like oil slick???? gods ur fuckin mind
RACKET IS SUCH A GOOD NAME YOURE A LITERARY GENIUS ? I WANT THEM TO CHOMP MY HEAD OFF
782 2018-10-15 22:43:05 How odd!  Surely the “I’m alright Jack” mentality comes from “its Oor oil” brigade who seem to have problem with sharing?
783 2018-10-15 22:43:00 You’re a hedge fund manager.  Interest rates going up and this: US deficit rises 17% to the highest level since 2012. You know this ends badly. By 2020. Trump will blame dems for the crash in economy.  Oil prices and inflation skyrocketing
784 2018-10-15 22:43:00 Midterms please. Please democrats stand united and emphasize gas, oil and living expenses rising rapidly.
785 2018-10-15 22:42:34 I was responding to your assertion: "I don't believe that gas will skyrocket. No evidence of that."

What you and I would *rather* see happen doesn't change what I stated and you discounted.

So, do you still see no reason to think oil / gas prices will go higher?

789 2018-10-15 22:42:29 @NASCAR and @stevephelps should add short tracks and road courses to the CUP schedule in 2021 (or earlier if somehow possible) because that's the best racing and what the fans want. And should remove mile and a half tracks. Please add,

790 2018-10-15 22:42:29 Scotlands revenues 60 billion.we only got 27 billion returned. And with that we are outperforming Uk growth by double. Imagine just imagine if we kept all that 60billion. And run our own oil reserves.some of it classed as undesignated income. Scotland does not get.
791 2018-10-15 22:42:22 I’d oil myself down and squeeze between them
792 2018-10-15 22:42:21 Halliburton, maybe; however, BP (A British firm) and EXXON were already extremely, wealthy and have nothing to do with Iraqi oil, today.
793 2018-10-15 22:42:14 depends. If it's Jiff/Skippy, it goes in the cupboard. If it's all natural stuff, it goes in the fridge. Otherwise the oil separates and it's extra annoying to swirl it.

798 2018-10-15 22:41:50 WORST NIGHTMARE HAPPENED

was cooking, and the oil and water splashed all over me when a bubblE popped

no injuries cause it wasnt that hot but BOY DO I HAVE A PHOBIA
799 2018-10-15 22:41:47 @JustinTrudeau seeing that Canadian oil is selling at a 40 USD discount because we are at a competitive disadvantage, maybe the oil companies should sue for the lost revenue for your mishandling of the pipeline issues #albertaoil #pipeline #LiberalLogic
800 2018-10-15 22:41:39 If I was President, I’d drop the alliance with Saudi Arabia ASAP. I don’t care what it does to oil prices or our relations with other middle eastern nations. That country is a tyrannical murderous theocracy that needs to be isolated and sanctioned.
801 2018-10-15 22:41:39 Thank #God for his contributions. I'm just sitting here trying to figure out how a #billionaire dies from #cancer @ 65. #cannabis oil #ricksimpson #sad #toosoon

806 2018-10-15 22:41:18 YES THAT IS WHAT GOP IS HIDING BEHIND - THEY DON’T BELIEVE THE OVER 200 WORLDWIDE SCIENTISTS BUT BELIEVE OIL COMPANIES ONLY!!!
807 2018-10-15 22:41:18 Also, there was no veiled oil weapon threat from KSA...let me quell this BS now..was an OP-ED from a less than credible author/editor/publication and subsequently addressed by Kingdom authorities ..this is not the first incident either ..#justsaying
808 2018-10-15 22:41:16 The president can believe & support a Saudi prince. He dtWs the line at women who makes claims against his Supreme Court nominee or a senator who says she’s part Native American. In his world, Americans lie, Saudi oil millionaires tell the truth.

810 2018-10-15 22:41:06 Yeah the low opening bid has not went so well for past Billionaires,First that comes to mind is when John Paul Getty III was kidnapped in Italy by the Mafia his oil tycoon grandfather J. Paul Getty only offered up like 50K and then got the poor kids ear sent to him in the mail
811 2018-10-15 22:40:54 The split personality disorder must become jarring for them - NDPers passionately supporting and opposing the same projects and policies... except that the truth is the AB NDP only came to support Alberta oil and gas since the 2015 election. In their hearts, they hate oil.
812 2018-10-15 22:40:45 Decided to check out a fb group for druidic herbalism. Was there for less than 24 hrs. When they share stuff like "why seeds oil is healthier for cholesterol than olive oil" and seems vee gan based overall- I'm out. 1st, Druids/Celts were not vee gans. 2nd. I aint got time for BS
813 2018-10-15 22:40:40 Very misleading report on @Marketplace concerning Saudi Arabia, the United States, and oil. A) SA is a distant second exporter to the u.s. B) SA oil is not used as a substitute for Iran because...we haven't imported Iranian oil in 30 years. #sloppy @kairyssdal
814 2018-10-15 22:40:35 We must bury China in tariffs! I say bankrupt them and crash their econmy. Flood the market with crude oil to crash Iran's oil business. No money no oil China's military grinds to a halt! China is the greatest threat!

817 2018-10-15 22:40:23 About longevity - oil and gas supplies are finite. That's a real problem for longevity. He said to replace the EXPANSION. Then we have to find ways to completely replace fossil fuels ASAP.

821 2018-10-15 22:39:50 We buy very little oil from Saudi Arabia it’s all about the Trump/ Kushner financial connections.
822 2018-10-15 22:39:49 Question is would the free world continue to be so dependent on Saudi oil?  What will happen next?
823 2018-10-15 22:39:43 Does any dude know of a good beard oil to use???
824 2018-10-15 22:39:37 Cover with olive oil. I have several ziploc bags, but wondered whether I should leave to try or freeze it. I never thought or read about the olive oil part.

826 2018-10-15 22:39:18 Really feeling this carrot oil I been using in my hair
827 2018-10-15 22:39:16 You want oil to pop on his head
828 2018-10-15 22:39:09 Never get attached to things you can't buy easily. I've been furiously trying to get my essential oil roller from Chile to work because it works to destress me and low and behold it has nearly run out.
829 2018-10-15 22:38:53 Oh hey I'm in favour of the pipeline so oil can fetch top dollar on International markets. We don't need Saudi oil but using our own oil for consumption sounds like the NEP or Venezuelan policy.
830 2018-10-15 22:38:44 So if the oil was sold to China and other markets how does that benefit the Canadian consumer. Is China going to sell refined product back to us cheaper the Saudis or the US.. probably not... so the Canadian consumer pays and the US oil companies that extract the oil benefit stil
831 2018-10-15 22:38:41 I’m pretty sure science and Trump don’t mix.   It’s like oil and water.

833 2018-10-15 22:38:01 I freeze it to use over winter. Chop it up, put in a shallow container, just cover leaves with olive oil & freeze. Once frozen, I break it up and store in freezer bags.

835 2018-10-15 22:37:51 are these the same retards who predicting our stock market will crash "overnight" if Trump is elected? Time to get out the butterfly net. The reality is we don't need their damned oil.

837 2018-10-15 22:37:20 I’m off tomorrow but I have to wake up early to do my oil change. 
838 2018-10-15 22:37:16 So far cleansing oil, facial wash gel dgn hydrating light moisturizer je sbb aku amik yg basic
839 2018-10-15 22:37:15 Don't we produce oil?
840 2018-10-15 22:37:09 mannnnn get you a mahogony/teakwood candle and your life will be changed forever.. I like lemongrass/mint in an oil diffuser
841 2018-10-15 22:37:07 Liberals would love to see economic sanctions against Saudi Arabia, oil would sky rocket and ruin Trumps economy.
842 2018-10-15 22:36:54 I thought we were almost oil independent. I think former ambassador McFaul says Saudis provide only 9% of our oil.
843 2018-10-15 22:36:52 No actually it wouldn’t, Canada is our biggest supplier of oil,  we can get that 9% from them.
844 2018-10-15 22:36:46 Oil Change.
845 2018-10-15 22:36:45 Oil, trident, oil, territorial waters, oil, US trade deals, oil, renewable power and oil!
846 2018-10-15 22:36:43 Anything for more control over the oil in the southern part. It's devastating.

848 2018-10-15 22:36:41 I’ve heard bio oil works
849 2018-10-15 22:36:35 So reading that .gov link I see whiskey as an export is not an asset to Scotland and oil is distributed over the uk?
850 2018-10-15 22:36:05 Coconut oil :) if it’s alcohol based- rubbing alcohol. :)
851 2018-10-15 22:36:04 9% that’s the percentage of our oil that come from Saudis
852 2018-10-15 22:36:02 Get some peppermint essential oil & increase your magnesium intake.  if anyone is wearing gross perfume, slap them! I hope you feel better soon.
853 2018-10-15 22:35:56 Yeah that's a grave we dug a long time ago IMO. Part of me wonders how the area would have shaped up we were able to find oil/other valuable resources on our own soil rather than making them rich.
854 2018-10-15 22:35:46 Fuq me oil sales at 41 billion for this year ..and Scotland wouldn’t make the grade? That’s some good prop your snorting there mate!
855 2018-10-15 22:35:38 We have our own oil and it can be priced and any value we want - we don't need a bunch of muslim's making threats...

861 2018-10-15 22:35:04 Sí debemos hacer exactamente lo mismo, Sr. McDonald. Exporting our remaining oil resources away, using +20MM gallons of fresh water per shale well, while the gas is flared, the money borrowed and the oil discounted by 20 bucks per barrel, is the peak of energy policy ignorance.
862 2018-10-15 22:35:00 How much longer is it going to take them to learn that Saturated fat is healthy.. Trans fat is bad.. like vegetable oil, Canola oil, grape seed oil, safflower oil.. Wake up people..
863 2018-10-15 22:34:56 Russia’s power to steal elections has been overstated. Mostly what they did was just sew uncertainty by making people *think* they stole the election. They will do it again. We must elect a huge majority of democrats and then end oil dependency. Get out and canvass with me!! 
864 2018-10-15 22:34:49 Lately I been chiefing on oil cartridges and I feel like I've completely fucked up my tolerance and stuff
865 2018-10-15 22:34:44 the Curls Blueberry Bliss oil! it’s a little heavy for my hair type tbh but i only use a drop or two. any silicone free hair oil should be good! I think Maui Moisture has a good one too
866 2018-10-15 22:34:26 @AshaRangappa_  Empirically, there is not need for the USA to use any middle eastern oil. Strategically, there is no need; indeed, there is an advantage in not doing so. Environmentally, it's counter indicated. But again, there is nepotism, self-dealing, lobbists & corruption.
867 2018-10-15 22:34:25 Aldi prices are very good . Tin sardines in sunflower oil are only 34p and Lola had 4 sardines in hers the other day 
868 2018-10-15 22:34:15 You are getting angry at the wrong team. Big oil + ICE cars are polluting the air and using your tax money to pay for the oil wars. Human, environmental and economic cost of using fossil fuels is colossal.

911 2018-10-15 22:30:44 Wait! .. So with all the billions phone companies are making in Nigeria there’s not one phone factory in the country. 
-62 years after oil was discovered we  still can’t survive without importing petrol. 
-In 2018, bore-hole & roads are still campaign promises. WE NORMAL SO?

914 2018-10-15 22:30:17 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
915 2018-10-15 22:29:46 Y’all still use oil sheen, isoplus or pink oil?
916 2018-10-15 22:29:38 The oil you are getting from Mexico and Canada will be over $200. IT doesn’t matter where you get oil from the price is global and the top oil producers can lower or raise the price by cutting down or over supplying the global market with oil.
917 2018-10-15 22:29:31 Venezuela has a LOT of oil that they'd part with pretty cheap. America could leverage being a huge customer on Venezuelan national reform; if they increase human rights, we'll bring them into the financial 21st century. Win/ win, with a loss for human-rights-Monsters Al Saud.
918 2018-10-15 22:29:23 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
919 2018-10-15 22:29:11 men on here complain all day about your check engine light being on and you needing an oil change...but never under the hood fixing it for you. oh okay.
920 2018-10-15 22:29:08 Everytime a snake oil salesman tries to "compliment" me I say "thanks".

Translated to my truth it goes like I could give a shit less about your opinion of me. I have shit self esteem regardless of my progress and your unwanted remark isn't helpful, I don't believe you and
921 2018-10-15 22:29:04 Critical Thinking is a must. 
America has MORE OIL than Saudi Arabia (USA No 1 in the World), who only imports 8% of our oil.
Even IF we stopped drilling today - We would have enough oil for the next 50 years in reserve 

WAKE UP AMERICA 

QUIT FALLING for the FEAR MONGERING
922 2018-10-15 22:29:02 Anyone complaining about Crown Jewel better not be driving cars. The Saudi’s control almost the entire gas/oil industry too.
923 2018-10-15 22:29:01 So I went 8 months without getting an oil change, but I didn’t go over 3,000 miles. I stay driving every vehicle but mine! Oil was still on the stick mane!  now I need two tires. 
924 2018-10-15 22:29:00 They will getaway with it. Oil rules
925 2018-10-15 22:28:57 がんばれかーちゃんーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
926 2018-10-15 22:28:55 The UST- Oil price -Sovereign reserve fund merry go round , happened at “high” prices as was a tax on all indrustrialised and developing world
927 2018-10-15 22:28:51 Man one thing a man can NEVER say about me is that I smell. I may be buzzard cuz I don’t go all out with every dude but i DAMN SURE smell like coconut oil.
928 2018-10-15 22:28:38 How's about a vegan, dairy free, palm oil free one?
Never mind having a break, give the animals a fucking break!
929 2018-10-15 22:28:26 Just spilled all of my lavender oil on the ground..... im like actually not okay
930 2018-10-15 22:28:23 Their only exports are oil and radical fanaticism.  And, hijackers.
931 2018-10-15 22:28:22 Yes, he *will* be forgotten by nearly everyone who was not a friend or relative. KSA will go on being brutal, murderous authoritarians, and USG will not react because (1) oil, (2) hatred of Iran, and (3) Trump does not care.
932 2018-10-15 22:28:12 @FoxNews Prime example that we need to produce more oil!!! So we can tell the King where to stick his oil. Stop protecting these ungrateful nations.
933 2018-10-15 22:28:09 How many women want to work on oil rigs,bin collectors,  plumbers, engineers compared to men? Your saying it's going to be 50/50 and any difference is down to sexism and not preference? Stop telling women what to do
934 2018-10-15 22:27:51 Pricing wouldn't be a very good way to ascertain the amount of something in this case. Oil is generally abundant in many ways, but an oil prince can still artificially fuck with prices. To be honest, if we were already at nuclear level, your energy bill probably would be cheaper.
935 2018-10-15 22:27:38 Wishing u luckThat 49er defense has been leaking oil lately
936 2018-10-15 22:27:35 Ever had Mac n cheese from scratch made with the oil from the bacon 
937 2018-10-15 22:27:32 He's right on energy.  You are wrong on oil.
938 2018-10-15 22:27:31 Because we control the world price of oil and also OPEC
939 2018-10-15 22:27:26 Do I have any essential oil momma followers? 
940 2018-10-15 22:27:23 Drink some extra fkin virgin olive oil with that
941 2018-10-15 22:27:23 Jamal Khashoggi. influential. influential family, esp. his uncle. called out whabbism and the king. oil. weapons deals. this was a killing with CIA approval.
942 2018-10-15 22:27:17 Because we control the world price of oil and also OPEC
943 2018-10-15 22:27:10 I just saw a steam powered train hauling oil tanks roll past a wind farm. #texas
944 2018-10-15 22:27:10 In Ontario Big Wind is owned by Big Oil & Coal. The major players in  Ontario's  wind industry are fossil fuel corporations like Suncor,  Enbridge, TransAlta, Capital Power, Veressen and NextEra. Unreliable wind energy is just an enabler for fossil fuels.
945 2018-10-15 22:26:38 I hate when u buy something "leather" & it smells like fish. Google says it's cheap fish oil. I'm mad because I love this ipad case & keyboard...but the case stinks
946 2018-10-15 22:26:19 I think you do not know the news about the economy that controls the world's oil is Great Saudi Arabia 
947 2018-10-15 22:26:14 Arrogant Pete Sessions is definitely not good for 70% of the citizens of Texas!!! He only represents big oil and insurance!!!
948 2018-10-15 22:26:07 Good thing #C4News mentioned judge responsible for FrackFour jailing's sister is up to her neck in oil and gas investments.
949 2018-10-15 22:26:04 It is not because of the oil shock.  Though it didn't help...
950 2018-10-15 22:25:58 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
951 2018-10-15 22:25:54 Cbd oil and a interesting podcast to distract the mind
952 2018-10-15 22:25:53 So instead of selling Newfoundland oil to Canada it's sold internationally at the top Brent crude price.
953 2018-10-15 22:25:42 Biya ki baato ney mujey Sunflower oil bana diya hai.
954 2018-10-15 22:25:38 And imagine them doing all that without hydrocarbons. Although it does sound better no renewables are capable of replacing oil and gas at this time
955 2018-10-15 22:25:31 Perhaps they want to sell you some oil wells in Saudi Arabia 
956 2018-10-15 22:25:29 I likee knife oil painting

959 2018-10-15 22:25:14 Once up a time? Obama era, US not needed to import oil, whats change?
960 2018-10-15 22:25:06 There will be no "Zero" Iranian oil sales starting in November..to think so is naive and ill informed...and to print so is just irresponsible #oott
961 2018-10-15 22:25:05 Sheyat pang apat na plate ko na ng pasta waowaowao may chili oil kasi ih
962 2018-10-15 22:25:04 Well....the libs are pushing for Trump to take a touch stance...so they can use it against him when oil prices skyrocket. Gaslighting 101.
963 2018-10-15 22:25:00 Decent points - we could use domestic Canadian oil and not support awful countries with abysmal human rights record. Pipelines would make that easier. Rejecting them is moronic.
964 2018-10-15 22:24:58 It’s because they know what Azerbaijan has done to Armenians including its failure in its barbaric act of finishing a genocide AZ still denies it happend.  We don’t need to offer oil and laundromat bribing to attract others.  All we need is to offer them the truth and honesty.
965 2018-10-15 22:24:54 Smoked a couple joints. Got my oil changed. Took my dog for a walk. Decent day
966 2018-10-15 22:24:49 coconut oil is bad for your skin I-.....
967 2018-10-15 22:24:47 I'm rolling croissants with my bare hands(washed by the way)in a video and You re telling me to wear gloves next time. Do you tell a puff puff vendor to wear gloves to drop puff puff in oil... let's respect ourselves.. plis dear!!!!!
968 2018-10-15 22:24:36 I'm sick of extra virgin olive oil. I like my olive oil extra slutty.
969 2018-10-15 22:24:30 we already cant by oil from iran... venezuela.. and we have a law against buying it from russia who skull fucked our political system.. 

now..with all of that being said..........

"do what"?
970 2018-10-15 22:24:29 @beardbrand just discovered your YouTube channel and have already ordered your beard oil. Great tips. Given me great tips to persevere with growing a fuller longer beard
971 2018-10-15 22:24:15 Que alma pequena cara. Pra vc defender a democracia é palhaçada??? Faltou nas aulas de história né? Não vá no U2, Pearl Jean, Midnigh Oil ( acho que nem conhece), pq vai ouvir pior. Recomendo Xuxa, Angélica e por aí vai.
972 2018-10-15 22:24:11 Well, the rest of them also didn't deliberately destroy their oil sectors.
973 2018-10-15 22:24:07 Headspace is really good to unwind! You can but cbd oil from Holland and Barrett so I might pop in tomorrow and see. I think it’s a much weaker dose than online but also cheaper x
974 2018-10-15 22:24:04 The Saudi blackmail attempts over oil, from a generally horrendous country, should hopefully act as a major warning sign that they are the allies of no-one. They are a highly dangerous country. Just witness what they are doing in Yemen.
975 2018-10-15 22:24:01 USA does not need Saudi Oil.
976 2018-10-15 22:23:59 Except energy East was for export not to replace Saudi Imports. We produced plenty of oil in Newfoundland at Tidewater and most of it gets exported. The reason we use Saudi oil is because Irving chooses to buy it. They probably even get it at a discount.
977 2018-10-15 22:23:58 3/Many of the jobs in the manufacturing sector for which tRump is taking credit are actually rehires in the oil sector, in a rebound in 2017, following a steep slump in 2014-16.
978 2018-10-15 22:23:53 i showed someone how to reset their oil light after getting an oil change once so yeah basically i can change your oil if you need it
979 2018-10-15 22:23:46 Yes , for thus reason he can make you homeless , when he stop exporting oil, you will return to using bicycles and donkeys as a means of transportation
980 2018-10-15 22:23:43 Just a premeditated interrogation accident, so it's OK. As long as they keep spending millions on Trump properties and buying our bombs. What country did most of the 911 terrorist come from? Oil and money fix all sins. #UnstableMoron #CadetBoneSpurs Strong denial = truth, SAD
981 2018-10-15 22:23:41 New policy to get more money with less oil....Brilliant!!
982 2018-10-15 22:23:39 How convenient--a cleaning crew just happened to show up to the Saudi embassy 2 hours before a joint investigation/inspection into the possible (probable) murder of Saudi dissident journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. Why (oil) do we continue to recognize these animals?
983 2018-10-15 22:23:36 Me embalé con mis amigas por el disfraz de halloween y ya decidí terminar en fuel oil y no pensaba ni pisarlo, soy tan difícil
984 2018-10-15 22:23:22 Tea tree oil dry it tf out. Periof
985 2018-10-15 22:23:20 If Saudis want to make us pay four dollars a gallon, I say we pay it for domestic oil, not for a muslim product!!!
986 2018-10-15 22:23:19 plastic is made from oil... 

kerosene.. winter is coming.. 

diesel... for transportation of goods... 

gas for commerce/tavel/mobility

i mean. its just absolutely irrational to think we can do anything that wont hurt us far worse.. 

and im a liberal dem.. im just realisitic
987 2018-10-15 22:23:18 Can't slander Guyana no more oui they have oil n a hard rock cafe
988 2018-10-15 22:22:58 It is going in Grants to their rich mates. Like the Oil & Coal Barons on the REEF!!
989 2018-10-15 22:22:54 And of course oil, how not that's a classic. "We are here to free the people! and since we are here let's rob anything we can, for the freedom!
990 2018-10-15 22:22:48 gonna need % of GDP leveraged on oil to get a better understanding here. this is very rough

992 2018-10-15 22:22:41 What Oil He Use ? Full Synthetic Only Give Me 15k 
993 2018-10-15 22:22:37 Trump destroyed protections for some of the last Native's lands in order to build an oil pipe.

Then he scraped off protections for endangered animals for the same reason.

But Cherokee Nation arms MAGA w/verbal ammo ignoring Descent vs Affiliation cause we need more chaos right?
994 2018-10-15 22:22:36 someone plz give me an essential oil diffuser. I would die of happiness
995 2018-10-15 22:22:27 Juniper berry essential oil. It's completely gotten rid of my kids nightmares!
996 2018-10-15 22:22:08 I wonder how those midwestern cold AF states starting to feel  as the price of heating homes is higher now. In RI the cheapest for home heating oil is $2.70, I have not see that since Bush. Gas was high ALL summer in NE
997 2018-10-15 22:21:56 If you enjoyed @RobertJShiller's column in the  Times over the weekend, you will love this dynamic graphic on oil prices from @WSJGraphics from 2016.  h/t @georgikantchev
998 2018-10-15 22:21:25 Waiting to get my oil changed and homeboy plopped down right next to me. I shit you not this guy must be watching (loudly) a video of someone eating with no other audio. WHY 
999 2018-10-15 22:21:23 You poor darling. I’m on crutches, but healing due to the best medical care. Hope you have great nursing & a quick recovery. 

Get CBD oil from the health food store. It’s a terrific pain killer. Rub it on Knee, achy hands from crutches (and carpal tunnel) America loves you.
1000 2018-10-15 22:21:22 How are the Saudis gonna charge $78 a barrel for crude oil? It tastes TERRIBLE
1001 2018-10-15 22:21:17 We better increase pumping our own oil.
1002 2018-10-15 22:21:16 OSR is oil seed rape, this is a good spring crop for bees and enables us to have 10/12 hives in one place.  Finding permanent sites with flowers throughout the summer is quite difficult and were hoping to expand our colony numbers in 2019
1003 2018-10-15 22:21:10 Gotta hand it to @StaceyDooley once again for teaching us all a thing or two #fashionsdirtysecrets

I never knew that #fashion is the 2nd biggest #environmental polluter (1st is coal/oil)

Businesses need to put planet over profit. Money won't save any of us if there's no water!
1004 2018-10-15 22:21:01 If you have even the faintest idea how much Nigeria is getting from oil revenue alone... Makes you wonder chale
1005 2018-10-15 22:20:55 If they prove that #SaudiArabia is responsible for killing that journalist I would hate to be Iraq, Iran or literally any other country in the region other than Israel because there's no way the US is ever gonna do shit to SA as long as the oil keeps coming. Source: 9/11.
1006 2018-10-15 22:20:53 But Trump said our clean coal and oil was producing more than anytime in history. We are exporting now. What happened?
1007 2018-10-15 22:20:49 See @jamespmcleod repsonse. Succinct and accurate. 
Scenario after Trump complained about oil prices for a while now. 
World: Threats
SA: we will force oil prices up. 
Trump: Come up with some explanation.

The Saudis are threatening the US and the world because of its possible involvement in an atrocity
1012 2018-10-15 22:19:52 And a friend of mine is in the oil field supply business, and he's booming.  I hardly see the guy anymore, he's too GD busy.  Record orders.  My brother-in-law also works in the field, with no shortage of contracts, and my brother works a H.O. job, and had to hire more staff.
1013 2018-10-15 22:19:42 Came to get my oil changed because I’m literally terrified of my husband. #partyhard #getstuffdone
1014 2018-10-15 22:19:38 This first movement to respond to any sanctions is just the beginning, things will happen even more than the high price of oil
1015 2018-10-15 22:19:35 Midnight oil vibes
1016 2018-10-15 22:19:34 So how do we retaliate? They can thumb their noses at us and any one else that depends on their oil. The #bigorangehead said if he cancels their $100 Billion Arms Deal, they will go elsewhere  like Russia or China and we lose 40,000 jobs.
1017 2018-10-15 22:19:29 Couldn't one say that the oil crash was the proximate cause of Venezuela's collapse, but the underlying cause was government policy?
1018 2018-10-15 22:19:28 For private coal/gas/oil company profits...on the TAXPAYERS DIME. >:(
1019 2018-10-15 22:19:20 You criticize people for not knowing the facts yet you clearly do not know either. It is always easier to complain what is your solution. Will we have to live in the dark? Is nuclear an option? Can we incrementally make improvement - eliminate coal & then high sulphur oil & so on
1020 2018-10-15 22:19:14 Also fish oil

1025 2018-10-15 22:19:00 We can’t force anything but we can invest money into solar farms and nuclear plants to give them access. And climate change concerns everyone so no it’s not about “whatever they feel like doing” just like the whole world has a right to shit on the states for enabling oil giants

1040 2018-10-15 22:17:49 I can't imagine anyone dumb enough to vote against solar power, anywhere, but here, in Arizona where the sun shines all the time? Yet there is big money fighting our solar energy initiative, claiming it'll cost seniors more. It will, but not more than they're gonna pay for oil.
1041 2018-10-15 22:17:42 Maybe not since they only make up 12% of our imported oil.
1042 2018-10-15 22:17:38 First the Nanny State Western nations agree to sanction Iran and claim no oil will get out of port. Then they wonder why prices are going up.

The Saudis are threatening the US and the world because of its possible involvement in an atrocity.
1044 2018-10-15 22:17:33 We don’t need Saudi oil. We only import 9% of all our oil from Saudi.
1045 2018-10-15 22:17:17 If our community can commit to bringing this issue up to our elected politicians & those seeking election, every time they come before us for support, they will have no choice but to acknowledge #AmericanDOS or leave us alone. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. We must never let up.
1046 2018-10-15 22:17:13 "The 2,500 foot setback was arrived at in a very non-Colorado way, set without dialogue or debate, by a group of advocates who, although perhaps well-intentioned, want to see oil and gas development seriously curtailed, and perhaps even halted, in Colorado."
1047 2018-10-15 22:17:05 I damn near drown myself in oil and still end up getting ashy like my skin sucks up all the oil and lotion I put on 
1048 2018-10-15 22:17:03 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
1049 2018-10-15 22:16:53 US oil could support it's own demand if it really wanted to.  The issue is there are not enough refineries established but if we really wanted to, they could be built in short order especially if the market dictated it.  At some point these threats by the Saudis fall on deaf ears
1050 2018-10-15 22:16:46 Not sure whyy I would schedule my oil change for after work on a Monday 
1051 2018-10-15 22:16:45 There is either a move to undermine Saudi Prince to get rid of him and his modern policies or the establishment’s need for raising oil prices and tensions to damage Trump’s economy. Why this man’s fate is a big deal I don’t understand!
1052 2018-10-15 22:16:41 Thanks, and I’m learning how good olive oil is for hair too!
1053 2018-10-15 22:16:33 Good job getting ahead of the Saudi fallout SaudiNews, I mean @FoxNews Turns out they killed the poor guy during an “interrogation.” Maybe the US wouldn’t be so weak if we weren’t dependent on foreign oil. We guess it’s ok for the US to be weak when it makes old white guys rich
1054 2018-10-15 22:16:24 crying because I have a headache and then my crying turns into the reason of us not having any oil so I can fry mot sticks pregnancy hormones I tell ya
1055 2018-10-15 22:16:21 Zut, je n'ai pas réussi à entendre ce passage :( un replay traîne quelque part ?)
1056 2018-10-15 22:16:09 Thought all I needed was an oil change, left the shop with new tires, an alignment, new wipers, and the oil change  send help pls
1057 2018-10-15 22:16:08 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
1058 2018-10-15 22:16:06 It’s one of those nights. Couldn’t understand why oil in skillet wasn’t heating. Eye had come unplugged. Then burned the chicken. Then turned heat down on veggies and up on sauce. Ugh. I just hope it’s edible.
1059 2018-10-15 22:16:04 It’s dead simple, you don’t even need oil as you can fry off the onions in water.
1060 2018-10-15 22:15:56 Oil at 400 yuan and more Russian bases in the ME
1061 2018-10-15 22:15:53 I like to poach eggs in it and use sesame seeds, sesame oil, tabasco, ginger, or a bunch of other stuff lol

1067 2018-10-15 22:15:35 True plus I’m not planning on bleaching it so I guess as long as I keep doing coconut oil masks it should stay pretty silky
1068 2018-10-15 22:15:33 Why when they account for less then 8% of the oil??
1069 2018-10-15 22:15:22 I should’ve gotten an oil change instead of going shopping

1073 2018-10-15 22:15:11 Using your nuclear weapons 'appropriately' to make America Great Again? come on we've heard so many bullshit from the US government since Iraq war and guess what? there was nothing but 'OIL' and dozens of dead Iraqi soldiers and citizens. Great JOB JOB JOB America!
1074 2018-10-15 22:15:10 And those officials likely have oil stocks in their portfolio.
1075 2018-10-15 22:15:01 Putting lotion on my tattoos makes me feel like I’m cleaning and restoring a damn oil painting, I am a beautiful glossy piece of art.
1076 2018-10-15 22:14:42 This rumour is gathering momentum!!! Still not sure how I feel about it, could be nice to see money go into the club, but oil money???
1077 2018-10-15 22:14:36 We have some Texans that have boots n oil $$... thinking they might use em to kick the Soros back to his hole.
1078 2018-10-15 22:14:32 So kind, Thank You. if I was in a place to grow tomatoes, I do not know if would any would survive me just eating them, on sandwichs, cut up with a little balsamic and olive oil, or just washed like a apple with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Homegrown tomatoes are the best.
1079 2018-10-15 22:14:30 Now I’m not 100% sure if your using any fluid in your gearbox that’s similar to Automatic Transmission Fluid but if you are is it a life time fluid or are their regular service intervals? And if it not similar to ATF what fluid/oil do you use?

1084 2018-10-15 22:14:15 I made coconut oil!!!!!! I feel accomplished. Like I did something.

1087 2018-10-15 22:13:55 おはよ！
頑張ってね！
1088 2018-10-15 22:13:45 The federal government doesn't have a  tax on oil, though Texas and other states do levy oil production through what are known as severance taxes. Legislation to enact a federal per-barrel oil tax hasn't even come up for a vote in the House since O'Rourke was elected in 2012.
1089 2018-10-15 22:13:34 Ukraine issue is sadly about ethnic cleansing, not oil.
1090 2018-10-15 22:13:33 WOW! At OBAMA era U.S. stop importing  OIL. Whats changed?
1091 2018-10-15 22:13:16 Looks to be very low density for suburbs by even low density UK standards. Though of course there are cities in the USA that have huge gallons of oil per head per year quotas. What would be the typical journey distance to this school? Why are there no footways? And no cycleways?
1092 2018-10-15 22:13:06 I'm in control of my game, you must respect me like an oil projector
1093 2018-10-15 22:13:04 Friend: what’s your favorite essential oil?

Me: bacon grease
1094 2018-10-15 22:13:04 Saudi Arabia well some of their people are threatening to raise the price of oil to $200 a barrel to punish the United States if the United States puts any kind of sanctions on them for killing the journalist. We are literally being held hostage by the Saudis.
1095 2018-10-15 22:13:01 Trump needs to cut off all military sales & backing, to Saudi Arabia, let em raise oil to two hundred dollars a barrel , then they won't sell any, we're oil independent,  so what's to worry. Screw those Arabs, it's time,they're money making days are over. Let em go belly up.
1096 2018-10-15 22:12:58 A car oil kink
1097 2018-10-15 22:12:57 Were way too in bed with them regarding oil revenue, arms sales, and geopolitics. Honestly if it weren't for those three reasons, Oil being the big one, we would've dumped them in 2002.
1098 2018-10-15 22:12:51 Well, they did give them land in Oklahoma! Then stole it again when that there “oil boom” came along.
1099 2018-10-15 22:12:49 We have plenty of oil here.
More drilling. More jobs.
1100 2018-10-15 22:12:45 Delighted that my MP, @beynate helped push for a debate in parliament on #climatechange and the latest #IPCCReport. But not expecting it to make much difference, since the government decided to invest in oil infrastructure instead of the massive shift to renewables we really need
1101 2018-10-15 22:12:45 @traderadio give us some good oil on the Swans please! Can they salvage this trade period having lost Hanners and Rohan, missed on Vandenberg and Langdon and only bringing in Clarke (who will be solid) and getting points for Blakey.... Is there a big name coming???
1102 2018-10-15 22:12:32 good luck getting individual investors such as myself back after the disaster of the last 10 years of zero return from our investments as natural gas profits went to zero and oil close to zero
1103 2018-10-15 22:12:26 “Free SHS is ensuring that our oil revenues are being equitably distributed to our people, and not ending up in the pockets of a few.  The most important resource of any nation is its people.”-@NAkufoAddo #TheChangeWeVotedFor #UKGhanaInvestmentSummit2018 #FreeSHSIsHere
1104 2018-10-15 22:12:24 You can make the same infographics about nearly anything. Co2 is pretty harmless, you can even drink it in your soda, so why not burn all the coal and oil?
1105 2018-10-15 22:12:10 I love cabbage. My weakness is fried wings. But I got an air fryer and use no oil, and I don’t bread em. Taste JUST like it was fried!
1106 2018-10-15 22:11:57 guy you making noise here okay.. Lemme enjoy my new macbook here.. cos I can go on and on right from sts deal, infamous buss branding, $100m oil revenue lost, the dubious 190 aircraft for ghana army, brazil world cup saga  corruption scandal at SSNIT etc.I beg make we think!
1107 2018-10-15 22:11:52 Awesome!
1108 2018-10-15 22:11:49 Venezuela’s collapse has more to do with government malfeasance and ineptitude than declining oil prices.
1109 2018-10-15 22:11:49 @JaxAustin How hard is it to find used vegetable oil for the bus?

1111 2018-10-15 22:11:31 Westminster has near bankrupted an oil rich UK.
They have had our resources for 50 years and still trillions in debt.
They have had thier chance.

only in the minds of scot`s unionists.
1112 2018-10-15 22:11:29 i never use coconut oil or baby oil because it leaves a gross film in your eyes and leaves your skin feeling nasty!! idk why people love it so much

1116 2018-10-15 22:11:10 as bullshit as it sounds, I wouldn't be surprise since those rag head desert assholes have a lot of oil money.
1117 2018-10-15 22:11:06 Akwa ibom people will still beg you
1118 2018-10-15 22:10:58 Absolutely! Think about all the oil, silver, Gold, diamonds, precious, gems and minerals.  God deposited it all in this earth for His kids!!! We are to be captains of industry. Notice when Gods temple was built. All the people of position were Jews the manual labor were Gentiles!
1119 2018-10-15 22:10:54 may they choke on their oil
1120 2018-10-15 22:10:53 Question is how much engine and transmission work was done during those million miles (not to mention 300+ oil changes) This is one motor and one set of gears. Big difference.
1121 2018-10-15 22:10:52 Yeah but... something about bonds... blah blah duty... VAT something... will actually cost us millions same as the oil - better off not having exports... or industry... rinse and repeat for anything positive about Scotland
1122 2018-10-15 22:10:41 Bull shit we have more oil in storage than we could use in 1000 years.
1123 2018-10-15 22:10:30 "our technology allows us to replace expansion of coal and oil already" is simply not correct. Renewables simply do not have the capacity, reliability or longevity to replace coal, oil or gas.
1124 2018-10-15 22:10:29 That’s excellent! We truly appreciate your business and the kind words you’ve shared. Hopefully we’ll see you when it’s time for the next oil change!
1125 2018-10-15 22:10:29 yeah def. light coating on an oil makes em golden brown
1126 2018-10-15 22:10:27 I have a Rimmel lip oil that literally feels like water on your lips but i think it’s discontinued

1130 2018-10-15 22:10:17 Watch the Ingineerix YouTube vids. Front & rear drive units have spin-on filters and fill plugs. Cleverly, drain plugs weren’t used because the filters are used to drain gear oil. Gear oil temps are closely controlled by the integrated cooling system. Basically, it’s oil heaven.

1134 2018-10-15 22:09:57 Scare tactics by the government run media, FOX. We get most of our oil from ourselves, Mexico and Canada. Which of course we pissed off.
1135 2018-10-15 22:09:54 Horseshit.
U.S. has more oil reserves.
Tell the Saudis they cannot have spare parts for all their American made planes.
1136 2018-10-15 22:09:42 Amazing. Saudi Arabia will even make more money and produce less oil 
1137 2018-10-15 22:09:39 The new #socialist regime in #NewZealand is for a carbon zero nation:
- Banning oil & gas exploration
- Taxing gasoline until it becomes unaffordable (& driving up the entire economy’s cost structure)
- Taxing farmers whose livestock burp & fart ‘greenhouse’ gases.
NUTS!
1138 2018-10-15 22:09:37 何故だかバターコーヒー美味しく感じない朝。バターというかギーだけど。mct oil 使ってないからかな。昨夜ペペロンチーノ作ったら美味しくできました
1139 2018-10-15 22:09:27 Hi where do you get your oil please?
1140 2018-10-15 22:09:23 Saudi Arabia you try to get oil to 200 a barrel we will blow you off the face of the fucking of the  m************ earth! Fuck You rag head bitchs
1141 2018-10-15 22:09:23 No. It makes him look like the businessman he is, ready to do lip service for whatever it takes to maintain that "deal" we have w/ them. They have 8% of our oil input from that region..May not seem like a lot but when we are willing to deplete it from somewhere else before home?
1142 2018-10-15 22:09:18 We sold out of CBD oil on Thursday but it is all back in stock now! Sorry about the inconvenience.
1143 2018-10-15 22:09:16 We would create 1000s of high paying jobs to build a new grid and infrastructure, also. Time is running short. Coal, gas and oil lobbyists need to be run out of DC. #Sustainability
1144 2018-10-15 22:09:15 Canada’s running a deficit, we’re in debt up to our ears We’re unable to sell our oil other than to the USA at a 30’. Discount . We aren’t a rich nation, we are a broke nation spending billions on illegal immigrants. No pipeline yet East Canada buys Saudi & Venezuela Dictator Oil

1147 2018-10-15 22:09:04 I’m on CBD oil tonight (aka watching a Liam Neeson film, whichll hopefully have same effect)
1148 2018-10-15 22:09:02 Then we open our reserves and trade with other oil sources.  Saudi needs the U.S. regardless of what they say.
1149 2018-10-15 22:08:58 IMO cannabis will have positive impact on alcohol & opioid problem. Another positive, although you don't get high from CBD oil it too has very beneficial qualities, esp for arthritis alzheimer's mental health & many other infliction's= better health, more effective treatments
1150 2018-10-15 22:08:55 when you pay for your own oil so sitting in bed and being able to see your breath doesn’t bother you 
1151 2018-10-15 22:08:40 do you want both of the same oil or do U wanna choose a different second one from the thread:) it is honeylavenderseriespo 
1152 2018-10-15 22:08:24 Absurd. If SA doesn't sell its oil to the U.S., who are they going to sell it to?
1153 2018-10-15 22:08:19 Bitch I already don’t have none  I’ll put some oil on my eyes to take shit off  . But they be so cute, & last ! So how you get them off ?

1155 2018-10-15 22:08:14 I'd imagine they googled wpg airport, James Richardson International came up. Were to high sniffing oil fumes to figure it out.
1156 2018-10-15 22:08:07 I am so sick of the USA kissing Saudi Arabia's ass. Yes, I'm a conservative. Yes, I voted for Trump. No, I do NOT like the arms deals. Yes, I understand the oil relationship. I still don't trust the Saudis. If they hadn't struck oil, they'd ALL still be living in tents.
1157 2018-10-15 22:08:06 My car was due for an oil change in JULY but barely reached the 3000 miles yesterday, the tech literally said your oil looks fine to me lmao wtf is the point then ugh

1159 2018-10-15 22:08:03 @tix5000 I think the plastigauge tells you to use it dry, but I oil it, and I lay it across the bearing surface, right out both sides, if the squished plasti isn't the same all the way across, the rod is twisted. not uncommon in high rpm

1167 2018-10-15 22:06:55 This is total bullshit. We were attacked on 9/11 by Saudi Nationals. I am by no means a war hawk, but fuck Saudi Arabia. They don’t get to kill people with impunity because they have oil. Trump’s arms deal is a scam.

1170 2018-10-15 22:06:36 it's not only due to iran sanctions, it has other political reasons like Kuwait not exporting its oil to USA.
110b$ army material contract has not been approved by the Congress.
They will if they want, remember some years ago that they wanted to kill shale oil industries.
1171 2018-10-15 22:06:35 Stupid! No one is giving Trump any $$$. It’s more about oil to fuel Americans cars. @POTUS has said sanctions may come!

1177 2018-10-15 22:05:54 We can and should cut ourselves loose from Saudi Arabia immediately.  The idea that we have any shared values with this kingdom is absolutely absurd.  It's only about oil and arms.  End of story.  Let's end it.
1178 2018-10-15 22:05:52 But, can a good beard oil sort out these hotel protestors driving me into madness for the second week in a row? 
1179 2018-10-15 22:05:43 Abegy, best economy in Africa with nothing to show for it. We too dey deceive ourselves for this country.

 Nevertheless, we lost that title when the price of crude oil drop drastically. When u lost your source of income, you have to micro-manage your resources else u borrow more
1180 2018-10-15 22:05:31 Hundreds of thousands of people died needlessly in Iraq yet there are people who are writing this off as nothing and still praising Blair? The war was illegal, the 'evidence' was manufactured, Blair and Bush were well aware of this. People died for greed, oil and the dollar.
1181 2018-10-15 22:05:21 11/ So then we started looking to try to build up Saudi Arabia as a counterweight. The Saudis were rightfully terrified by a radical shiite regime that hated it on its border. Even after they reamed us with the embargo, with Iran gone, we needed the oil even more.

Labour should tax the oil giants to fund renewable energy infractusture.. BP made 1.9bn in profit last year alone.

1189 2018-10-15 22:04:40 The threats from the Saudi crown prince seems to be a good reason for the US to produce more oil!

1205 2018-10-15 22:03:35 Finally some good news for me. I bought 12 litres of olive oil by mistake earlier in the summer. #unwittingBrexitandClimateBreakdownstockpiling
1206 2018-10-15 22:03:31 Q: Do I think countries conspire with petroleum companies to manipulate the price of crude oil @SEC_Enforcement?

A: Yes I do, and the amount of smuggling of illicit crude oil is proportional to its price per barrel.

1207 2018-10-15 22:03:30 Remember the Saudi secret are tribal people who have oil. They're so corrupt and do not live by rules.

I am only slightly surprised that his "base" don't catch on to the snake oil salesman. They will NOT accept that he LIES almost every single time he laps his nasty lips, despite the pure
1210 2018-10-15 22:03:12 If the UK doesn’t sell Saudi Arabia weapons, another country will.

Morally vacuous? Yes, so here’s a counter proposal:

Eliminate their funds so they CAN’T buy arms - by switching to renewable energy. i.e. Don’t buy their exports (oil) so they can’t afford arms imports.

1223 2018-10-15 22:01:46 Should stick it out but the more I’ve looked into this CBD oil the more I think it would benefit me better.  Even though I’ve been uncontrollably low for the past few months, I don’t think I want to carry on taking the meds purely because I don’t think I need them enough 
1224 2018-10-15 22:01:35 You know how when you get an oil change they always try to sell you extra stuff? Well today as they asked me to turn my car back on...my battery died.  So, I sprung for the new battery.
1225 2018-10-15 22:01:32 Putting oil companies out of business is not socialism; it is Realism. Because removing business license, for reasons other than insider trading, has not been done before, oil companies have no defenses against it. In contrast, they have lots of defenses against taxes.

1238 2018-10-15 22:00:33 Well there isn’t, the dollar is backed by oil, the American will kill anyone who challenges that fact, frankly Mr Franck, we’re all slaves to it.

1249 2018-10-15 21:59:52 Yes I can.  We no longer depend on Saudi Oil and they can only hurt themselves by manipulating prices.
1250 2018-10-15 21:59:48 But those other oil-dependent countries also didn't diversify their economies, and they all took only a minor hit from the oil price crash. 

It wasn't oil, Barry. It was "Bolivarian socialism".
1251 2018-10-15 21:59:48 It can be a political legal decision but @JustinTrudeau is too weak to impose sanctions against Saudi Arabia to stop Canadian firms from importing Saudi oil.

1254 2018-10-15 21:59:24 Unemployment is ALWAYS higher in Calgary during an oil bust. That has NOTHING to do with the NDP! Youth unemployment rates in Canada averaged 14% between 1976 and 2018 and reached a high of 20.7% during the huge 82 bust! Immature memes don't show leadership. #ableg
1255 2018-10-15 21:59:12 This is the sort of country I’m rather proud to have mad at us. Their treatment of women and LGBTQ+ people is barbarous. If only we weren’t so shortsighted as to block the Energy East pipeline - we could have ended our dependence on Saudi oil - shame.
1256 2018-10-15 21:59:06 The U.S. Navy uses more oil than anyone, and he signs off exporting our oil reserves.

The U.S. Navy could become "high and dry".

The U.S. Navy and the oceans protect this country, perhaps more than anything else. 

..at minimum, it is a major contributor to sovereignty.
1257 2018-10-15 21:59:02 Do your car tell you the oil level?
1258 2018-10-15 21:59:02 Oil companies filled a demand. Albeit some of that demand was most likely caused by the oil companies themselves. So there’s that. But trying to stuff the sh*t back in the goose isn’t going to help. We gotta figure out how to keep the wheels spinning w/o junking up the planet.
1259 2018-10-15 21:58:40 Yes, and Texas has always been oil country.
Of course I see the irony in it-do you think Texas is being punished for producing the material that in essence is polluting the earth?

Not to mention the incredible retrofit of all the FF run stuff to electric. And last I checked oil does many things electricity can’t.

1302 2018-10-15 21:54:41 He is also not trying to upset the oil prices for Americans. Saudi’s could mess that up big time for the next year. Gas could go up $5 dollars a gallon and home heating huge!

1307 2018-10-15 21:54:07 Why should we “beware” of how you handle your own?
That should be a given (for your own). That’s like telling us you’re going to change the oil in your own car. 
1308 2018-10-15 21:54:04 My CBD oil was delivered today, so I’ll be trying it for the first time tonight when I take my usual pain meds.
1309 2018-10-15 21:54:01 And Jimmy Carter said the planet would be unable to meet increased demand for oil by the mid 1980s. How'd that little claim work out? It's 2018, and we are awash in oil. There long term claims of disaster just have a way of mitigating themselves, or, mankind finds an answer
1310 2018-10-15 21:54:00 Absolutely soul destroying but no country is prepared to stand up against #SaudiArabia #oil Millions of Yemeni dying of hunger and injuries from Saudi bombs supplied to it by UK and USA! Where is the UN?????????
1311 2018-10-15 21:53:59 You be having that good oil in it
1312 2018-10-15 21:53:58 Girl try CBD oil, look into it. It helped me get off my anxiety meds after 2 years of being on it!
1313 2018-10-15 21:53:54 He let that Saudi prince purchase to own 100% of the biggest oil refinery in Texas.

He allowed multi-national "investors" to remove oil at a rapid rate with DAPL pipeline, and he allowed Canada to hook up to our pipelines to remove oil.

..and oil up North.

..buys from Saudi's.
1314 2018-10-15 21:53:53 Can’t understand why u continue to obfuscate and finagle the facts when u know damn well that if we don’t start lowering C02 levels our Earth will at some point end up being unliveable. We have the technology to capture 90% Of stack CO2 but u and your oil buddies won’t use it!
1315 2018-10-15 21:53:53 I really loved them all, but if I had to pick a favorite it was either Fish or Oil Can. Which means I guess I didn't really pick a favorite did I?
1316 2018-10-15 21:53:51 Money could be warranted and arrested, oil could be replaced in a heartbeat but the oil prices would still jump up due to instability of the major supply- namely KSA...
1317 2018-10-15 21:53:46 So according to the TV advert I just watched, 74% of 115 women prefer Oil of Olay. That’s 85.1 women! What does that even mean? 85% recommend it, one person rates it 1 out of 10 and the other 14% hate it, or was the 0.1 just a really short woman?
1318 2018-10-15 21:53:45 どっぽとひふみについて語ってたら電車逃しました
1319 2018-10-15 21:53:44 And by the way, the average American doesn’t need Saudi for anything! Nothing! Not one thing! It’s only the super rich suckling the oil teet who need the Saudi’s!
1320 2018-10-15 21:53:30 If anything, try to use the buddy system and definitely set a meetup spot! I’ve heard CBD oil also works wonders for anxiety, I just ordered some myself  and you’re more than welcome to join my group or even have my number and you can text me if you’re feeling anxious there!
1321 2018-10-15 21:53:20 You're posting an article that has nothing do with the point. No one said energy wasn't important to population. It was simply stated that oil is not the only energy source, nor does it have to be -- the post is about nuclear. So, again, I'm not sure exactly what you're goal is.
1322 2018-10-15 21:53:14 I’d  this f’ing fish bone from dinner is still in my throat in the morning I may have to go find some olive oil! Hmm i wonder if Nutella will do the trick? 
1323 2018-10-15 21:53:11 Did you know: The UK *doesn't* need Saudi Arabia's oil. What it *does* need is Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth, to make up its own current account deficit (1/2) > via @davidwearing #AngloArabia #CAAT #YemenGenocide #KSA #Khashoggi
1324 2018-10-15 21:53:10 the combination of bread and fat is up there in human achievements but it has always been surpassed by the combo of rice + chili oil

1326 2018-10-15 21:53:02 Oil drilled by Norway and sold to the UK will count in the UK's emissions, not Norway's.

1328 2018-10-15 21:53:00 The 1 that just hit Florida was supposed the worst 1 to hit that area since the mid 1800’s. So yea global warming is just a BS cause 2 keep tax payers $ rolling in. Plus it also keeps gas gas,oil,& coal price at prem. highs if the tell us digging less or running refinery’s is bad

1331 2018-10-15 21:52:46 Avoid using toothpaste on your face, sudocrem, aspirin, and tea tree oil are some recommendations but I’m not sure how effective they are
1332 2018-10-15 21:52:38 Simple is always safe. 

Blend up:
Tomato 
Cilantro 
Onion
Jalapeño
Juice a couple limes
Add salt. 

To give it a roasted flavor. Throw some oil in a pan and burn the skin of a the Tomato, onion n jalp before blending. 
Add more jalp to make it spicer.
1333 2018-10-15 21:52:36 Unfortunately, you are wrong. You have either been deliberately misled by the oil and coal industry and the puppet politicians they have in their pockets, or - worse - you are doing the misleading!
1334 2018-10-15 21:52:36 In the finale, the Chiefs could use oil made from seeds from mustard plants.
1335 2018-10-15 21:52:35 Actually, it can... in case they sanction KSA, the oil price will go up rapidly and trump administration don't want this, since they have midterm election ahead.
1336 2018-10-15 21:52:28 Canadians will certainly find out quickly whether Donald sees them as a sovereign nation or Puerto Rico north with water, oil and his favorite...natural gas!
1337 2018-10-15 21:52:26 I'm sick and told my man to stick his dick in me like a thermometer. I also said it's like checking for oil, if it comes out wet I'm ok. 
1338 2018-10-15 21:52:12 what the FUCK oil changes are 30 bux where the hell did u gooooooo and what oil u put in
1339 2018-10-15 21:52:08 Cenk should have a secret meeting with Trump and laugh about what happened at Standing Rock as they say how they love billionaires who love oil and how they love getting paid! ;) I'm guessing Trump loves Nexus and loves the Koch bros. Cenk at least loves Nexus.
1340 2018-10-15 21:51:54 The tip of the fucking ice berg some yeah spilt sunflower oil all over the worktop and it’s spilt all the way into by drawer 
1341 2018-10-15 21:51:53 Why the concern trolling? Plenty of jobs require long shifts be it nursing or oil industry or many others.

1344 2018-10-15 21:51:44 Is it time for Australia to get back to refining its own oil? Is there anything stopping us? We used to once.
1345 2018-10-15 21:51:40 Get with it Devin! Saudi Arabia has more money and oil than Canada It's all about money to Trump Nothing else matters What a shallow human being he is
1346 2018-10-15 21:51:37 /4 Something remarkably similar happened in Iran. Britain had long-standing relationship and exploitation which was that had made it possible for Churchill to convert the British fleet from coal to oil. After the war, we partnered with the Brits to support the Shah...
1347 2018-10-15 21:51:34 Those oil workers should receive paid training for sustainable energy careers
1348 2018-10-15 21:51:27 And that's the story of events back long enough to use coconut oil, something I can't stomach.
1349 2018-10-15 21:51:21 It is not much money compared to what is spent on immigrants here, and the money sent out of the country.

..all that money would stay here.

..and our citizens served first.

There is much about Trump I do not like, especially oil pipeline that removes oil from North America.
1350 2018-10-15 21:51:19 He doesn’t say Canadian oil was labeled a threat, he says Canada was labeled a threat. You just need to read more carefully.
1351 2018-10-15 21:51:19 Pete Sessions is a chud.

Ted Cruz is like if a chud fell in an oil slick and was cleaned off with cursed towels.
1352 2018-10-15 21:51:17 Why did God give them all that oil? . Why did God give the West cars but little oil?
1353 2018-10-15 21:51:15 He talks around the subject.  He's such a snake oil salesman. I'm going to have the cleanest air . . . by allowing more radiation, more asbestos, more coal, more fracking, more pesticides . . . Yeah, let's get back to perfect condition.
1354 2018-10-15 21:51:03 Not related, but im so glad i found your @ ! Appa magic love scone and oil, lube, service are the best fics i've read 
1355 2018-10-15 21:51:02 I know! Teach me how to change oil! This is so ridiculous. $75 for oil change Reeeeee
1356 2018-10-15 21:50:58 Taking about the price of oil can raise the price if oil, but the US doesn't get that much of it from Saudi Arabia these days. In 2017, most US oil comes from the US (77%). Imports accounted for 19%, and 40% of that came from Canada.
1357 2018-10-15 21:50:57 Seriously? He's saying that moving from coal, oil, etc to natural gas is leaving us with cleaner air than we had before. How can you possibly be so ideologically blinded so as to miss that or deliberately try to misinterpret it is such a ridiculous way?
1358 2018-10-15 21:50:50 This clown said 2 hours for an oil change nigga I don’t have that much time to waste I’m goin to the east side.
1359 2018-10-15 21:50:50 Is the punchline "... and in the end, nothing really came of it, because of oil, Iran, and investment money?"

1369 2018-10-15 21:50:05 After carefully studying the picture, I can confirm it’s an overcooked beans with red oil 
1370 2018-10-15 21:50:04 People who try to drag CBD oil are the ones who need it most 
1371 2018-10-15 21:50:02 Only one of these two statements can be true
1) KSA must change through 2050 agenda as soon its oil in ground will be worthless
2) KSA can do what it like because it has oil
If it believes in 2) now MBS has abandoned essential 2050 reforms and disappointed KSAs many friends

1378 2018-10-15 21:49:21 /3 They sweetened that deal with a gimmick that let Aramco take a tax credit against whatever cash they put into the King's personal pocket. After the 1973 war and embargo, they bought out ARAMCO's assets in three tranches and turned it into the state oil monpoly. Again like Ven.
1379 2018-10-15 21:49:18 I don’t know Saudi is an oil dictatorship so barring Iran banzai charge why would Faisal try to oust him (especially since MBS understand that he need Faisal if he still want to rule/live)?

1384 2018-10-15 21:49:09 I've always thought the answer is no. Based on my understanding that the dipstick is only measuring the oil reservoir, whereas there is some amount of oil circulating through the gears--and that can only be changed by an actual oil change.

1390 2018-10-15 21:48:39 Tar sand bitumen is not oil and the process required to extract, dilute, ship and process it, requiring LNG n its condensate is dirtier that coal.

1408 2018-10-15 21:47:15 Unless you’ve got your own oil well (and refinery) in your yard, you’re doing business with companies which they keep a stake in, if not outright control. That’s how the world works.

1412 2018-10-15 21:47:08 I mean, show me another oil-dependent state that has suffered anywhere near as much as Venezuela. Russia? No. Nigeria? No. Iran? No (despite massive sanctions!!). 

Nowhere. Only Venezuela.

Your story about why Venezuela has collapsed is not a good one. It wasn't oil.
1413 2018-10-15 21:47:05 Just got out of a meeting with the energy guys that would talk to me,  Latest estimate is that today's record price discounts on my oil and gas represents a loss of 4.6 billion.  Remember this has absolutely nothing to do with the consultations me and Harper bungled.
1414 2018-10-15 21:47:02 "Real story" now vs. your #fakenews for the past 30+ years (back before Exxon Valdez oil spill)?
1415 2018-10-15 21:46:55 Can we get going with the Green New Deal yet? The oil industry needs to go quietly into the domain of obsolescence. Accept death as i evitable, stop fighting science. You look tremendously selfish and stupid. We need climate action ASAP
1416 2018-10-15 21:46:54 Changing the House and Senate on Nov 6th would not be making America worse. It would be changing strategy.

Spreading misinformation in an attempt to bankrupt or slow the only major company fully trying to get us off foreign oil and combat CC would be making America worse.

1432 2018-10-15 21:45:46 At least Obama wasn’t directly profiting off the oil. He was far from perfect but you’re supporting a guy who sold out Natives to get another gold toilet seat.  

Have a nice day!
1433 2018-10-15 21:45:44 Are you meant to dilute tea tree oil :/ because this thing is burning my face
1434 2018-10-15 21:45:42 As stated before, Venezuela is almost exclusively dependent on oil revenues. Saudi Arabia is heavily dependent too but is a monarchy, is a big influence in OPEC and enjoys huge support from our government
1435 2018-10-15 21:45:41 clove oil (which tastes like death) or swish Ouzo around your mouth like it's mouthwash
1436 2018-10-15 21:45:40 They killed that man. Dismembered his body. Period. Saudis have a culture of lying to cover their corruption. And we still buy oil from them #shame
1437 2018-10-15 21:45:39 Tonight's show reports:

Oil market all over the place lately and some saying we could see $100 a barrel oil before it’s done.

Terry Scruton talks with Tom Kloza global head of energy analysis with Oil Price Information Service for a look at what to expect in the coming weeks.
1438 2018-10-15 21:45:35 Lmfao we don’t even import your shitty oil anymore fuckface
1439 2018-10-15 21:45:34 I mean who goes to Saudi Arabia to play tourist? They have oil. They have sand. And the rogue killers are a definite tourism downside.
1440 2018-10-15 21:45:14 If you're oil free how on earth are you getting your fat soluble vitamins?
1441 2018-10-15 21:45:13 A. That's ridiculous. Much of what we've done has also been done using other technologies. 

B. That's the entire point of this person's post. Move to a better energy source away from FF -- nuclear. Instead of the ignorant anti-nuclear crowd helping the oil industry indirectly.
1442 2018-10-15 21:45:06 LOL. Good one. Are you saying economists make bad policy makers? Wasn’t that Stephen Harper’s claimed bona fides? Question is, if we don’t price carbon what would your plan be for achieving 50% reduction by 2030? Ban combustion engine sales? Nationalise and fold oil industry?
1443 2018-10-15 21:45:05 This is not going to happen, the Turks will take money from the Saudis, and they with Trump's help will cover this up. A scapegoat will take the fall, and the Saudi Prince will get away with another atrocity. But, if they do, will Trump sent in the Marines to take the oil fields?

1446 2018-10-15 21:44:57 “C’mon you guys” says Trump. “Everybody makes mistakes - well I don’t, but you guys all do - and we can forgive them because they give us shitloads of oil and money eh?”
1447 2018-10-15 21:44:55 oil money no dey buy toilet..start respecting me..aboarh
1448 2018-10-15 21:44:53 Becuase their oil contains everything and as such some of it must be made of real snakes.
1449 2018-10-15 21:44:51 Total fat consumption has gone down.
Vegetable oil consumption has gone up.
Are there any graphs on fried food and/or total calorie intake?
1450 2018-10-15 21:44:46 Oil spill still Friday or no ?
1451 2018-10-15 21:44:44 Sunflower and sesame oil are bad for you
1452 2018-10-15 21:44:40 Nigeria has natural resources like oil but still a poor nation,America has artificial resources like guns but a rich nation in debt shithole
1453 2018-10-15 21:44:36 Some commentators are funny today. They say that MBS will retaliate with jacking up the oil prices if he is pursued. Trump will swallow him meat and spit him out bones. MBS will be just another notch in Trump’s club.
1454 2018-10-15 21:44:19 Why do oil magnates always seem to deny man made climate change? 
1455 2018-10-15 21:44:19 @toluogunlesi why is @OfficialPDPNig always want to come back to power when the crude oil price is rising to 90dollars per barrel
1456 2018-10-15 21:44:06 1/ US-Saudi ties go back to the 30's. Britain and France locked the US out of Mesopotamian oil. Saudi Arabia, which gained independence after World War I, gave a consortium of American oil companies, d/b/a ARAMCO exclusive rights to look for and exploit oil in SA.
1457 2018-10-15 21:44:01 Do you send it to México? truDEFENSE, essential oil

1478 2018-10-15 21:41:25 POP QUIZ: Is the U.S. gap between oil production and consumption greater now than it was during the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973?
1479 2018-10-15 21:41:21 No more oil from the ground or anywhere.
1480 2018-10-15 21:41:14 But did you get an oil change?

1489 2018-10-15 21:40:25 first time using castor oil as a body moisturizer and I feel like a human sized gummy bear

1491 2018-10-15 21:40:13 A pore just gets clogged and over time a buildup of oil and dead skin cells just make it grow. She probably knew it was there and just didn't know what to do about it / waited until it was that bad to take care of it

1496 2018-10-15 21:39:51 Loooooooooool imagine, no debt, all the money we generate anyway, then on top of that we got a little oil money just in case we feel naughty
1497 2018-10-15 21:39:47 At this point, it has to be viewed as clear No.1 and No. 2. With Schneider's inability to stay healthy and Kinkaid's play, the vet has to come back and earn time.

1513 2018-10-15 21:38:10 The issue of the dollar as to do with the drop of oil price, all I am saying is that we should not say let's manage this one first cos I believe atiku is never & will never be the way forward
1514 2018-10-15 21:38:04 @greggutfeld two comments: why does a U.S. citizen go to the Saudi's to get permission to marry a woman from TURKEY? The oil company are getting all of the individual tax cuts( gas prices are going up. 4.05 / gallon)! Why isn't the President calling the oil company's in for talk
1515 2018-10-15 21:38:02 true. 

that's a different issue though. 

Maybe its a money thing, vegetable oil is cheaper
1516 2018-10-15 21:38:00 Typically, soybeans are planted in the late spring. In the Summer when they flower, they can produce up to about 80 pods. Each soybean pod contains about 2-4 pea-sized beans which are high in protein and oil!
1517 2018-10-15 21:37:56 did you get an oil stain on your face?
1518 2018-10-15 21:37:55 My husband recently retired and we thought he wouldn’t be able to work bc he’s been in oil & gas for 40+ years. But he was called to consult immediately! We were very pleasantly surprised.Oil & gas had just gone through a downturn but is turning around a bit
1519 2018-10-15 21:37:46 The money spent wasn’t exclusively spent on the poor or programs for them. Their economy originally flourished but it was based on oil revenues and when that tanked the economy did too. So Venezuela was as dependent on capitalistic markets as we are.
1520 2018-10-15 21:37:42 Зачем сувать? Это ж Тэхён!
1521 2018-10-15 21:37:33 So you’re ok with this? Above business should be righteousness. There are other countries that sell oil.

1523 2018-10-15 21:37:13 Is that because of OPEC setting prices? Because everyone says we are pretty well self-sufficient with our own oil production and our reserves.

1543 2018-10-15 21:35:55 Always follow the money.  Why might the Cherokee Nation not want @SenWarren to gain influence?  I reckon because they are interested in oil money.
1544 2018-10-15 21:35:54 Not exactly true. I hear lots of discussion on it in the east, mostly in favour of building the pipeline and also discussion around pipeline east and getting it going. Anecdotal evidence would suggest support for the Alberta oil getting to new markets

1556 2018-10-15 21:35:10 Will @JustinTrudeau stop importing Saudi oil after this or will he play tough for a week and go back to business as usual?
1557 2018-10-15 21:35:06 But that has nothing to do with our individual actions and choices. We all know oil companies are terrible. But we don’t do anything about it.
1558 2018-10-15 21:34:57 all I think about is oil money, these niggas barely getting tour money...
1559 2018-10-15 21:34:51 They covered it under warranty but the wait was 2 months for the engine. I traded instead. When they got the engine it blew in 7 miles. Got another, sold the truck and it blew again for the new owner. Oil delivery to the twin turbos was the problem. End of my story.

While it doesn’t have the mouth feel and taste of chicken it is a great filler.  Add barbecue sauce or mustard.  I recommend.

1570 2018-10-15 21:33:50 Oil and fossil fuel is what “ Conservative Thinking “ is all about! That’s what Scott Pruitt was all about! He was out to destroy President, Richard Nixon’s Environmental Protection Agency and why Jeff Sessions is out tearing down existing protections in the workplace & nature!
1571 2018-10-15 21:33:38 Trump and Scott are both con men, snake oil salesmen, anti-American hucksters intent on destroying our democracy (rather, what's left of it).

1573 2018-10-15 21:33:26 these fuckers are responsible for 911, atrocities in yemen and spreading extremism in muslim world...USA needs to get over the hate of iran and love of oil and treat saudia the way they should be treated. @NickKristof
1574 2018-10-15 21:33:23 obv you did not share da load
1575 2018-10-15 21:33:16 Everything that has been done thus far has been on the back of oil.

Peak oil is already here.

1581 2018-10-15 21:32:08 my calculations are based on British Petroleum's 2017 Annual Energy review. They show worldwide production and consumption of oil, gas and coal in this report, its like the 66th year in a row for the report. Its online

1583 2018-10-15 21:31:49 Saud was put in place to guard the oil wells after FUKUS withdraw after WW1. Remember Lawrence of Arabia?
1584 2018-10-15 21:31:44 Hopefully, we finally stand up to the Middle East - we've sucked up for years because they have oil but they're scum
1585 2018-10-15 21:31:36 True a lot of them had businesses (oil merchants, cloth traders etc...)
1586 2018-10-15 21:31:00 It doesn't hurt to try! I love CBD Oil! If you have any questions I can help you!
1587 2018-10-15 21:30:56 I tried cleaning our upstairs carpet today with our carpet cleaner we've had for a couple years. The thing ends up dying, spitting out what I'm assuming is oil, and leaving behind a mess only a carpet cleaner could clean. It's Monday.
1588 2018-10-15 21:30:53 They will need more oil to sell and wheat will become more expensive since they can’t grow any of it in the deserts!
1589 2018-10-15 21:30:52 Joint military exercises, joint oil exploration, explosion of mixed marriages!
1590 2018-10-15 21:30:51 I use coconut oil (long chain) in magic butter machine. 
in my Magic Butter machine. It turns out a great oil that I put in peanut butter or anything I want. Use it in recipes in place of butter. Me and my dog are very happy with our peanut butter every morning.

1592 2018-10-15 21:30:46 it’s officially “you wanna pay the oil bill? put on some more blankets” weather 
1593 2018-10-15 21:30:35 One thing to consider beyond the sensitive nature of this issue, is the fact; they got us by the ---- Oil that is.
1594 2018-10-15 21:30:33 "Ethical oil" is perhaps the biggest oxymoron I've heard since "progressive conservative".
1595 2018-10-15 21:30:31 Yup. The Free Trade deal that Mulroney signed and the NAFTA deal that Harper signed, gave away most of Canada's industries like auto manufacture, cereal and soup plants, furniture and wine business, lumber and grain business, to the USA. Oil is about all we have left.

1597 2018-10-15 21:30:18 Do people actually use oil that isn't olive oil? 

Why

Olive oil is delicious and lindy.
1598 2018-10-15 21:30:17 The original post was advocating ppl reduce their meat consumption. People in the developing world often rely on seafood for protein, we’re eating all their fish or killing it with oil and run off from factory farms.
1599 2018-10-15 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1600 2018-10-15 21:30:16 beechwood vetiver fragrance oil smells really nice.
1601 2018-10-15 21:30:13 I just had a fly go right up my nose, and I fucking lost it, Incase you’re looking for someone who is insane.
1602 2018-10-15 21:30:10 Venezuela went under because of its obsession with oil money. The US should learn from that.
1603 2018-10-15 21:30:02 They do not care as long as we buy the oil
1604 2018-10-15 21:30:02 Avocado oil is a healthy alternative to vegetable oils. Avocado oil is rich in monounsaturated fats like olive oil, but it is stable at h...
1605 2018-10-15 21:30:00 I thought the USA was self sufficient in oil. Tell these Stone Age barbarians to keep their oil and freeze their financial accounts.
1606 2018-10-15 21:29:56 Here’s something a little more fleshed out. He has direct control over the ministry of defense, the ministry of the interior, and the national guard. He runs the state controlled oil company. His power is unlimited essentially.
1607 2018-10-15 21:29:48 That’s right. I voted remain but only because I love my European brothers and sisters and celebrate free movement of people. I think the EU stinks to high heaven, it’s stuffed full of lobbyists and ran been corrupted by Finance and oil.
1608 2018-10-15 21:29:45 いってきま、、
1609 2018-10-15 21:29:44 James 4:14  Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him. anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
1610 2018-10-15 21:29:41 What about his refusal to renew oil blocks to the looters.  
1611 2018-10-15 21:29:39 Opinion: Don't rule out $400 oil if the US sanctions Saudi Arabia, FAKE NEWS FROM TRUMP PEOPLE, his is an excuse they want to use for allowing MBS to get away with murder
1612 2018-10-15 21:29:29 I hate when I go get a simple oil change, they find 1000 other problems like chiiiillllllll one problem at a time please 
1613 2018-10-15 21:29:22 i love olive oil
1614 2018-10-15 21:29:20 Buying factory meat& animal products is harmful for the environment, but so is buying vegan products w/ palm oil & other manufactured ingredients.Things are not b&w theres so much grey area- I wish people were more concerned w/conscious actions rather than sticking to an identity
1615 2018-10-15 21:29:20 This is some intense shit. They really going in, like the oil is vampiric, oil is a liquid, it doesn't have the physical capacity to be vampiric.
1616 2018-10-15 21:29:18 Wait, what?  So killing people is okay as long as we keep the price of oil down.  Does that work on a local level? Like, if I can keep QuickTrip at $2.36....
1617 2018-10-15 21:29:14 Oh please - we don’t need scare tactics like this about how powerful the Saudi’s are. Murdering a US journalist and resident calls for action. 

We only rely on SA for 9% of our oil. It’s high time we made that 0%. I hear Canada is a good alternative source.
1618 2018-10-15 21:28:54 Nah if u don’t reach the mileage that’s listed by then that’s a suggested date you’ll probably need to go get your oil changed again.
1619 2018-10-15 21:28:49 Bruhhh Stop The Jaw Jacking & Change My Mf Oil 
1620 2018-10-15 21:28:47 You're brave, leaving them in charge

Status: Currently guilt-eating daim bars.
1623 2018-10-15 21:28:23 Do Saudis even realize we like them for oil?
1624 2018-10-15 21:28:20 We could have led a green energy revolution starting during the Carter administration after the oil embargo. Things could have been very different today.
1625 2018-10-15 21:28:16 Brexit is the disaster. They promised UK would B better off.There were no downsides only upsides, it would B easiest deal in History, no 1 is talking about leaving the SM.

N380 for 2 spags

N50 Palm Oil

N20 Salt 

After boiling the spag & egg, fry the palm oil, and throw in the pepper, etc. Once the oil is done, add it to the spag

1632 2018-10-15 21:27:29 Hopefully there will come a time when we stop selling our souls for oil. Make no mistake about it. Saudi Arabia is blackmailing the US and the West with their oil.
1633 2018-10-15 21:27:23 22 minutes in, the panties found buried under the stairs are apparently a sign of necromancy, also there is oil all over the upstairs window blinds.

1644 2018-10-15 21:26:23 Does tea tree oil smell good? Or just like facewash?
1645 2018-10-15 21:26:15 Both Iduna and Julie's recipes sound amazing.

I'm also a fan of cooking them in a wok with balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and a little bit of salt and pepper.
1646 2018-10-15 21:26:11 Let's put on our thinking caps. WTF do you do about this massive screw up, stop buying Saudi oil? It's fungible. The global oil market is one big pool. We stop buying Saudi oil; somebody buys it. Be glad. A disruptive reduction in Saudi supply would be economically deleterious.
1647 2018-10-15 21:26:05 @SenBillNelson hi mr bill i am against bill s.3559 we need more incentives for electric vehicles cause if you mess with this you migth as well stop the oil companies incentives

1652 2018-10-15 21:25:46 i come in for a oil change, and find out there’s a list of shit i need to fix on my car 
1653 2018-10-15 21:25:39 People, people, people!!! When are you going to wake up??!!  Saudi Arabia’s hands are dirty with oil money! Who were flying the hijacked aircraft on 9/11? Saudis. Who did the US bomb? Afghanistan and Iraq. Why? Who controls the oil in the Middle East? Saudi Arabia. Wake up!
1654 2018-10-15 21:25:36 There were many fake Left people at STanding Rock who were infiltrators, informants, agent provoceteurs and mercenaries as they helped the oil company,the FBI, the local police and i guess the CIA. We do live in a corporatocracy/oligarchy/plutocracy.
1655 2018-10-15 21:25:36 And yet you are refusing to restructure from oil.... Buhari is the minister for petroleum still. Oil is what you people eat and drink

1657 2018-10-15 21:25:23 That’s not true. Trump has invented a new language founded on lying. He’s the worst kind of snake oil salesman. A pious fraud. The PT Barnum of presidents.
1658 2018-10-15 21:25:13 Good, I hope exorbitant oil prices will drive the market to support renewable energy development. Since, you know, doing the right thing isn’t enough of a motivator...
1659 2018-10-15 21:25:02 Ok, so now Donald Trump does another backflip! Rogue killers! Grow a set. Next time u might think b4 u talk. Oh, can u even do that? Worried the oil being off, we've got plenty! Oh wait, we export all hours & pay 15x when it lands again.
1660 2018-10-15 21:25:01 "Eat the savoury povorone first, in two or three bites - the last one with the olive oil spheres - and then drink the salad"
1661 2018-10-15 21:25:01 cause science doesn’t make them money. exploiting our natural resources does (oil n gas industries backing them financially etc)
1662 2018-10-15 21:24:59 Adulting is taking your broken ass car to the nearest Walmart Super Center to buy both power steering fluid and oil to fix said car so it lasts at least another year
1663 2018-10-15 21:24:59 It’s not over complicating. It’s understanding what you’re doing and what every tool is for. You don’t expect a mechanic to use every single one of his tools to replace your oil filter. But you need to know all your tools to be able to choose what’s appropriate.
1664 2018-10-15 21:24:57 Tita: Jana okay lang ba sayo mag 7 bluebills? Kasi nasa qatar daw si daddy mo nun.

Tita: okay lang yun maraming oil pastel na blue dito

I DIED HHAHHAHAHAHAHHHAA BAKET GANITO PAMILYA KO
1665 2018-10-15 21:24:53 Today CNN said that Saudi Arabia would retaliate financially if we impose sanctions against them for the killing of the reporter.

But doesn’t Saudi Arabia need us more than them? We’ve been net-positive in oil production for a while here. And they buy our jets.
1666 2018-10-15 21:24:52 Just the sort of announcement we would expect from you and him. I mean after all, you don't want anything to disrupt the flow of Oil & Arms, not even the cold blooded murder of a citizen of both your countries.  Depraved
1667 2018-10-15 21:24:52 Got oil pastels <3
1668 2018-10-15 21:24:52 Remember his criticism of Merkel and dependency on Russian oil?
1669 2018-10-15 21:24:48 Am not sure u read the post. Is either u didn’t understand or u can’t even read at all. A phenomenon where allocation of oil block were given without going through proper tendering has been fixed by this government. What did expect him to say?
1670 2018-10-15 21:24:47 Yup, and the state media says they're merging back together as of two years ago.

Also Canada imports make up about 43% of US oil (As of 2017) so are you sure your numbers from CNN don't include that?
1671 2018-10-15 21:24:46 Then Mr. Pearce sold his oil business to buy an oil supply business but lied about it, saying it was a party supply business.
#NOPearce4NM

1672 2018-10-15 21:24:42 What % of Saudi oil do we use? Their % control of global production?  I thought we were more independent than that.
1673 2018-10-15 21:24:30 We seriously have a ton of the most amazing, beautiful, gorgeous entertainers in West Texas here right now. They heard that the oil show guests like to party..... where ya at party people? Let's go! The official oil show party headquarters in open and ready for you.

1676 2018-10-15 21:24:23 @BBCR1 good eve, late tuning in! What a day. A friend even emphasized my life was more entertaining than eastenders! Up to eyeballs in heticness.
Nearly good night. Hot choc and oil
#Bedtime 
1677 2018-10-15 21:24:22 Iran used to be a progressive mid east power, then we destabilized it because oil, then they became a repressive terrorism supporting theocracy, and now they hate us because we're a bunch of government destabilizing jerks.

Which is fair- we started it.
1678 2018-10-15 21:24:14 Yeah, thanks Real Rx. Like we needed yet another reason to be disgusted by this man-child. He would just find another excuse to renege on his promise.

His groupies must be pretty dim-witted to still be buying his snake oil.

No wonder his disapproval ratings remain so high.
1679 2018-10-15 21:24:09 So, since I learned how to change the oil in my car yesterday, does this mean I’m #masc4masc now?
1680 2018-10-15 21:24:09 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.
1681 2018-10-15 21:23:59 I got some CBD oil for my 15 year old dog that was not eating. 20 mins after giving him the oil he was eating away.  The staff was very helpful and knew just what I should buy. Thank you guys so much!!
1682 2018-10-15 21:23:48 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
1683 2018-10-15 21:23:46 Clean and half. Stew a cut onion with a spoonful of honey in a pot with oil. When they're golden, add the veggies, roast them slightly, then add enough water to barely cover them. Put on the lid and cook for another 10min or so until they're done (not too long, don't overcook!).
1684 2018-10-15 21:23:41 I haven’t heard anyone asking what, exactly, we should do to #SaudiArabia about #JamalKhashoggi? I get that people are angry, but that that’s not a plan.

So, I’ll ask: what did you have in mind? More war? Not buy oil? Nukes? Kill their journalists in retaliation?
1685 2018-10-15 21:23:39 Meanwhile Softbank, Japan's second largest corporation after Toyota and a key partner of Saudi oil money, is tumbling in the stock markets. All this over a "journalist"? There's way more going on here.
1686 2018-10-15 21:23:35 Now Saudi Arabia is issuing threats about the price of oil - breaking a 45-year old taboo since the 1973 oil crisis.
1687 2018-10-15 21:23:31 My cousin did the castrol oil and she had the baby 3 hours later and my mom did it with my siblings
1688 2018-10-15 21:23:31 I have weekly headaches too- from sinuses, tension, bad posture, dehydration. Also clench my teeth at night! Try blending peppermint essential oil with jojoba or argan oil and annointing your temples and forehead. Works wonders! There are studies on if you want to research.
1689 2018-10-15 21:23:28 Then why did you f*cking vote for a SCOTUS justice who's likely to let oil and gas industries keep on putting CO2 into the atmosphere with minimal regulation?
1690 2018-10-15 21:23:27 C'est vrai que #Lutèce, zone inondable, est un quasi désert dépeuplé, bouffons méprisants et incultes d'#Oil,  #Pujadas et #Bastié !!
1691 2018-10-15 21:23:25 Why did you give Shell, one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters, an exemption to the carbon tax?

Can any Canadian small or medium businesses apply for an exemption? Or are exemptions for transnational oil corporations only?

Your carbon tax is a joke!
1692 2018-10-15 21:23:25 Or maybe Trump just think about oil and 110b$
1693 2018-10-15 21:23:11 Good to see the BBC reporting on the famine in Venezuela were three quarters of the population have lost 11 kilos in weight and there are frequent power cuts. It has huge oil reserves. This is what socialism has done. Remember this if you think Corbyn is the real deal
1694 2018-10-15 21:23:10 Off the shelf, tea tree oil and baking soda. Parsley leaf oil as well. I found it while trying to kill off some candida/thrush I was suffering from. Fixed me up pretty quickly
1695 2018-10-15 21:23:08 Do you realize the US is the number one oil producing country on earth as of September? We surpassed Saudi and Russia and still haven’t tapped into some of our largest reserves. Amazing what a President friendly to energy can do for the country.
1696 2018-10-15 21:23:07 Cold days outside make good days to stay inside and clean saddles. Besides, I bought new toys for my saddle so it was time to clean and oil things up. 1 down and 1 to go.
1697 2018-10-15 21:23:05 Remember that 10 years ago oil lasting 10k miles was unthinkable . Now we have oils lasting up to 25k miles . In terms of materials we do have the tech to creating engineered pieces that will outlast a human . Everything that breaks down is by design
1698 2018-10-15 21:23:05 Ha! Opposite for me! I loooove cooked spinach with olive oil and garlic! Not a fan of raw spinach.
1699 2018-10-15 21:22:57 Saudi Arabia is legit terrifying..... they are so loaded with cash & oil they think they can do whatever they want
1700 2018-10-15 21:22:46 Dow - over 100 less now than Jan 18!
Oil - over $10 a barrel up since Jan 18!
Wage growth YTD increase 2.7% YAY!
Cost of living YTD increase 2.9% BOO!
Deficit as % of GDP, 4.2% now.  3.4% last year!
I wonder why republican’s aren’t running on  an economic platform
1701 2018-10-15 21:22:44 Sounds like a great opportunity to face up to life without oil. Creative humanistic thinking will find solutions. Trust.
1702 2018-10-15 21:22:44 I'm getting my oil changed and I hear everyone in the back screaming frantically and then they come out and they're like okay sir can you please verify etc etc and then they go back in and there's more yelling
1703 2018-10-15 21:22:43 Snake oil salesman, plain & simplevote out all  slow down corruption & foreign influence in  politics & policies
1704 2018-10-15 21:22:41 They should drown in the oil
1705 2018-10-15 21:22:32 yes, and by "people" he means the oil and gas industry.
1706 2018-10-15 21:22:25 anyone interested in a 2004 neon!!!brake lights on  trunk won’t open  door won’t latch  and probably needs an oil change  serious inquiries only

1708 2018-10-15 21:22:24 Rachel Notley and the NDP are part of the same deep oil state that owns Liberal and Conservative parties. The only way to move beyond this reality is to elect more Greens both provincially and federally.

1711 2018-10-15 21:22:06 I hope I don't forget to buy coconut oil tomorrow. And tea tree oil. And glycerine.
1712 2018-10-15 21:21:59 You're proud?????? You must not have children.   Or maybe you think that just because you leave them a bucket full of the cash you made from big oil/coal/chem/gas, that they'll be fine. Based on your policies... they won't. Nor will mine, so HOW DARE YOU!!!!!
1713 2018-10-15 21:21:45 Actually, @alshanbri5 , go ahead...turn off the tap.  That will push us and the world into greener technologies WHICH DON'T NEED FOSSIL FUEL. All we'll need oil for would be rubber and plastics...and we can find substitutes for those too!
1714 2018-10-15 21:21:34 Really not understanding why Saudi Arabia is our “great friend” deserving of aid while Iran is our mortal enemy that we must destroy. Repressive governments, oil, connections to terrorism—what’s the difference?
1715 2018-10-15 21:21:32 I'm alright, thanks, I find your tweets quite rude and condescending. Describing a nascent sector as 'snake oil' isn't a great start. Enjoy NL, there are some fantastic collective self/custom build schemes there, though not any CLTs (yet).
1716 2018-10-15 21:21:19 Roast with olive oil and extreme annoyance
1717 2018-10-15 21:21:16 Thank you @grassosteve !  #SaudiArabia IS AN ALLY & OIL WILL NOT be restricted because of this incident....come on @GuyAdami - you guys are such fear-mongers! As Grasso & Karen said, you wont be talking about it very soon.

1722 2018-10-15 21:21:10 We don’t need Saudi Arabia for anything. Not their oil. Not their duplicitous “friendship.” Nothing. The 9/11 attackers came from there. They repress their own people, and murder innocents. Nothing justifies consorting with such a country.
1723 2018-10-15 21:21:05 At their peak the oil sands contributed 2% of our GDP. Jobs in clean tech passed those in fossil fuels a number of years back now. If you think the Greens are a one issue party, I would suggest getting better informed.
1724 2018-10-15 21:21:00 U.S. crude oil exports are expected to hit nearly 4 million barrels a day by 2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)

1726 2018-10-15 21:20:57 Yes, I'm 44 and still play video games.  I was sitting at the dealership waiting for my oil change when a lady and two kids walked by.  the older kid looking to be around his mid teens said "Aren't you a little old to be playing that?"  1/2
1727 2018-10-15 21:20:54 we need to uncap our oil wells & produce our own
1728 2018-10-15 21:20:53 so utd could be owned by some oil rich cunts with an amazing human rights record

1731 2018-10-15 21:20:35 as @mxkai3 slowly drifted off to sleep tonight they told me about some plans to make an incredibly spicy dish with chickpeas and carolina reaper soaked in chili oil

was pretty cute. they are asleep now and thats also pretty cute.

1733 2018-10-15 21:20:23 Should be turning to renewable energy, cut down on plastic and start making most new cars electric. Not just because of climate change and pollution but by using all these byproducts of oil, we’re giving more power to an oppressive Saudi regime.
1734 2018-10-15 21:20:17 Rigging of elections, removing governor and Senate president like shoes.
Allocation of oil Wells to cronies and friends.

1740 2018-10-15 21:20:00 Right, but how does that make 2 years ago ancient history? Also, do you know if this includes the import of crude oil from Canada, which is then processed in America and then sold to China?

Also you're ignoring your mistake about the KGB.

1748 2018-10-15 21:19:33 10 years after discovering oil in commercial quantities, Ghana held an open competition auction for oil blocs today. The first of its kind. Hope we’ll sustain this as time goes on.
1749 2018-10-15 21:19:29 You realize the carbon tax and liberal energy policy will wipe out all the small and medium oil players first and leave Mr.Williams corporation the last one standing. He'll buy up the assets of the others for pennies and have a monopoly thanks to you. You should not welcome that.

1754 2018-10-15 21:19:07 Nope, this has a target audience of two people only, Erdogan and Trump.
They understand accidents happen with annoying journalists and for some extra oil dollar contracts they will look the other way.
1755 2018-10-15 21:19:06 Pls also note that you @MrsGandhi and your troll friends kept saying that UPA has not paid Iran for the oil and that Modi is now paying for it. 
You should do something about your memory as is is fading faster than your years.

1761 2018-10-15 21:18:46 Bro, whether we like it or not, it has always been bad, else we are all suffering from amnesia, coupled with the fact that we lost our major FX due to oil drop. Wail till tomorrow, it won't change anything. We should have been wailing more years back, not now when the rot is deep
1762 2018-10-15 21:18:45 When you need bud or oil is when no one has any
1763 2018-10-15 21:18:32 In the 70s UK had near Hyper ,US huge , Germany 5% inflation and the US was /is a huge oil producer, so what was the fundamental difference and cause of the inflation ? #itsnotrocketscience

1767 2018-10-15 21:18:08 Good point  Has the proper 9/11 report ever been released or have the saudi’s got their way and had their part in it redacted and totally removed. Oil & big weapons deals has allowed them to act with impunity
1768 2018-10-15 21:18:06 We won't need the oil money, difference is he will spend what the club earn unlike the Glazer's paying their debt and taking 1 billion out

1773 2018-10-15 21:17:40 be sure to skin off any scum that will appear while the chiken boils (btw this should be in medium almost low heat once it starts to boil the water)

once its all ready in a bowl place 2 table spoons of soy tare/half a table spoon of sesame oil and add the broth (2/2)
1774 2018-10-15 21:17:20 the sheer animosity at the combination of fried eggs and oil, toast, and melted cheese is bizarre
1775 2018-10-15 21:17:18 Could fail a drug test but many have passed no problem. If worries choose a brand like Hemp Bombs who use CBD isolate and you will be fine. Just some prefer full spectrum as you will get more benefits from full spectrum CBD Oil.

1780 2018-10-15 21:16:52 Bwahahaha. Strong President. He tells Americans Russia didn't meddle in elections, while Putin said they did. He has money invested in Saudia Arabia along with big oil companies. We know the truth. Trump is a fraud. Money is his priority. Trump needs Saudis. Trump needs money.
1781 2018-10-15 21:16:36 Polish up your camel. Your days are numbered. We dont need your oil or your arrogance.
1782 2018-10-15 21:16:34 I think you need to understand the situation that is going on with currency and the reason for the tariffs.  Saddam was going to sell oil in Euros, and Gaddafi wanted to create a gold standard for Africa.  These two things would have dethroned America for being the top currency.
1783 2018-10-15 21:16:32 What does Saudi Arabia & Russia have in common regarding Trump? Trump has business ties to both. It is believed he is getting kickback on the S.A. arms deal. With Russia there is campaign collusion, money laundering & Exxon Mobile/ Roseneft Oil merger kickbacks. Money, money.
1784 2018-10-15 21:16:29 One spoon of castor oil, one egg, abit of yogurt, and some honey mix it all and put it in your hair for half an hour or so and then wash it out

1786 2018-10-15 21:16:24 No it's not. You are trying to make the argument that burning our oil is "cleaner" than burning oil from some other countries. Sorry - any oil burned produces GHG emissions which contributes to #climatechange. You are part of the problem.
1787 2018-10-15 21:16:23 Not sure how I possibly got a concussion from a bottle of olive oil falling out of the cupboard but when I do something, I guess I do it 100%.

1790 2018-10-15 21:15:55 @realDonaldTrump If they will recognise now that Khashoggi was killed 'accidentally' that means that Saudis are scared to not lose oil market control. That means that they have understand that their monopoly are not for forever. That means that you must act.
1791 2018-10-15 21:15:51 It just took time for those douchebags to coordinate their story with this corrupt version of Washington. Fuck Saudi Arabia. Fuck them ever since they were the main party responsible for 9/11. What is the USA's infatuation with them??? Oh yeah, they buy hotels with our oil money.
1792 2018-10-15 21:15:36 Saudi Arabia issues statement about Khashoggi murder...

“...It’s clear Jamal dismembered himself. He was very unstable that way...Hey, who wants some free oil?!
1793 2018-10-15 21:15:20 And yes Saudis are good only for grooming Camels and they are what they are because of oil money with which they buy people like you.
1794 2018-10-15 21:15:13 Enbridge’s Alberta Clipper (Line 67) pipeline expansion from Hardisty, Alberta, to Wisconsin completed on April 1, 2010.covers 1,081 km and exports an additional 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil to Canada’s largest customer.
1795 2018-10-15 21:15:10 absolutely! We should be buying Canadian oil anyway!!
1796 2018-10-15 21:14:55 I just spent $80 on an oil change. Someone come take my man card.
1797 2018-10-15 21:14:52 I just got an oil change & that’s bc my check engine light came on but now it won’t go off
1798 2018-10-15 21:14:44 Yes I tried RapidBrow before and it did help.  I'm going to try Castor Oil as it is supposed to be very good.
1799 2018-10-15 21:14:44 Regardless of what your profile says, you’re just another hypocrite supporting the same people who are trampling on their rights. But sure. Stay angry about THIS while Trump still throws around the word “Indian” and supports the oil companies he profits from. 
1800 2018-10-15 21:14:34 If you really love Florida and our way of life you will NOT vote for @RonDeSantisFL . He will trash our state by selling it off to big oil and turn our clean waters into toxic sludge. No seafood business and diminished agriculture.

1804 2018-10-15 21:14:17 I was waiting for the oil to ignite.
1805 2018-10-15 21:14:16 Or they slow oil production,gas price goes up,we say no more,they put some no body on trial and Saudi's money start flowing back in western economy.
1806 2018-10-15 21:14:14 Mother Nature is a tough old broad or we wouldn't be here. The real tech savior is fusion of which one very large corporation is working. If it fails the multinational oil companies you hate will be taken over by other countries unless we can develop directed energy weapons
1807 2018-10-15 21:14:13 The three notes are correct but what's the point of nationalizing oil companies if we have a carbon tax?
1808 2018-10-15 21:14:09 "Oil, gasp, I need oil.  Saudi oil. Oh, I'm dead."
1809 2018-10-15 21:14:02 If you're living a normal supermarket life, including some vegan options, and you're trying to avoid Palm oil you will probably starve. Same goes if you're a person who who enjoys such things as washing with soap and shampoo.

1812 2018-10-15 21:13:49 We don’t need them! Oil imports from SA are insignificant. They’re not strategic allies since they don’t complement our capabilities. They need us to compensate for Iranian influence in the region.
1813 2018-10-15 21:13:49 And of course our response to the #Saudis will be minimal since they are buying our weapons and we need their oil. #merica
1814 2018-10-15 21:13:44 It's because he is weak, the tough guy is just an act. @realDonaldTrump is sceard because we are oil junkies not to mention his bisness interests with Saudi.

1829 2018-10-15 21:12:30 You get corrosion from oxidation of the metal surface, the film of oil over everything prevents that. The oil has some very fine particulates but looks really good. The bevel surfaces look polished, so that explains the particulates.

1831 2018-10-15 21:12:28 But America is now self reliant on oil due to its shale oil gas production methods.. Oil is out of the table the only thing now is the & my goodness me they have a lot of them

1838 2018-10-15 21:12:12 China's natural gas output is up 9% per annum over the past decade, compared to 4% for the US.  China now produces almost as much gas as Pennsylvania does, the second most vital US supplier, and China's crude oil production has essentially been flat.

1912 2018-10-15 21:06:56 Given that a conventional car creates twice as much carbon pollution as an EV, there's a possible alternative in that regard. Too bad, the oil lobby has freely pushed back against the development of different sources of energy for decades. But yeah, the people are the problem.
1913 2018-10-15 21:06:54 Apart from 2 of the top 10 oil producing nations will be effectively removed from the market which means about 14 million barrels of oil will be missing from the market everyday, and I can’t see anyone covering that
1914 2018-10-15 21:06:51 Sad part is we have enough oil at home.
1915 2018-10-15 21:06:49 Nexus really wanted that oil pipeline in North Dakota even though they act like they care about all people & the planet.

1916 2018-10-15 21:06:49 Not true. Only 9% of oil in U.S. comes from Saudi Arabia. It can be easily purchased somewhere else, such as Canada or Mexico. Also, I would happily pay more for gas in order to not support the repressive government of Saudi Arabia.

1952 2018-10-15 21:02:48 Someone once said is Nigeria drilling ground nut as against crude oil in Dubai. It seems to be different kind of oil. 
1953 2018-10-15 21:02:41 .@TeamCavuto Carlinville, IL In the early 1900s site of a great many Sears Catalog Homes. An entire neighborhood was constructed of homes and was funded, in 1918, by Standard Oil of Indiana for its mineworkers in Carlinville, 149 of the original 156 homes still exist
1954 2018-10-15 21:02:41 Saudis 2001: send Atta & Bin Laden to execute 9/11 plan

GOP response: never ending war in Iraq & other countries not named Saudi Arabia / enable greed of oil industry / eliminate regulations 

Saudis 2018: cut deals with Trump fam / murder journalist / fake PR campaign 

GOP: 
1955 2018-10-15 21:02:40 1. Increased oil costs can slow global economy; "cripple" is a gross overstatement.

2. Increased earnings ignores the reality that decreased demand offsets gain from price increases & drives alt energy use.

3. Saudi's hate Iran for their own reasons, not because of U.S.
1956 2018-10-15 21:02:37 Get back to work, oil company crony and TR phony.
1957 2018-10-15 21:02:31 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

1959 2018-10-15 21:02:19 Incense and my oil diffuser really relax me. 
1960 2018-10-15 21:02:15 I felt like putting a bullet between the 
eyes of every Panda that wouldn't screw to save its species. I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all the French beaches I would never see. I wanted to breathe smoke.
1961 2018-10-15 21:02:13 Lmao Me: yo where Dre at?

Kenny: he on the other side of the plot hold up

*Kenny comes back* No Dre but full cup of oil: Here you go bro 


1962 2018-10-15 21:01:51  He thinks it’s like checking oil level in your car! 
1963 2018-10-15 21:01:50 If Proposition 112 passes, my job is at stake. But what about yours? It’s not just #oil and #natgas employees at risk. Vote #NoOn112.
1964 2018-10-15 21:01:48 My friends boyfriend came all the way to Franklin lakes from paterson to just give her an oil change. What is mine doing wrong?
1965 2018-10-15 21:01:48 Do you have a reference electric drivetrain gearbox that indicates otherwise?

Your mistake is assuming the oil behaves the same as an ICE vehicle. Not here, Low temp, no gritty carbon build up from degradation. Keep the oil happy you can drive it to Mars.
1966 2018-10-15 21:01:46 Okay so I’m like I’m bored why not bite down and fully eat a fish oil vitamin ew it’ll be nasty and maybe I’ll get a funny video out of it
IT TASTES LIKE FUKIN MINT IM ACTUALLY DISAPPOINTED

1969 2018-10-15 21:01:35 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
1970 2018-10-15 21:01:33 oil has been over 120 a barrel before and every other oil producing country would pick up for lost inventory from Saudis. .
1971 2018-10-15 21:01:28 Fellas, check your significant others oil levels today. Her shit is probably ready to blow up.
1972 2018-10-15 21:01:25 Well, Geopolitical goals on our end dictate we sit at the head of the table at NATO, not the European countries who think they can push the US around (i.e. Germany who is paying Russia for Oil)
1973 2018-10-15 21:01:25 Super appreciative that my students are brutally honest, even if it is just to tell me they don’t like my essential oil smell and want me to change it... 
1974 2018-10-15 21:01:23 Adding a "1 a day vitamin" and fish oil/omega-3 supplement has really helped me out... My hangovers went from lasting a few days to just a little extra rest.
1975 2018-10-15 21:01:04 And so because an interrogation "went wrong" they will absolve themselves and US will also go along after threats. All players change nothing about their relationship to eachother for money, oil, and support of foreign policy. Hmmm, business as usual...
1976 2018-10-15 21:01:03 Are we talking calipers or like checking her oil? I don't know which one is worse
1977 2018-10-15 21:00:50 Burnt the midnight oil by reading facts about Freddie Highmore. His favorite actor is Johnny Depp. His eyes are blue. His favorite color is Blue. He likes Pasta. He's fluent in Spanish, Arabic and French. Geez. I'm becoming obsessed. 
1978 2018-10-15 21:00:47 Avocados, nuts, dress your salads with sesame seed oil, potatoes, dates, falafel ~ obvs eat more calories than your body burns and also up your intake in healthy fats. Eating more carbs than fats makes your body use more energy from your carbs rather than your body fat storage
1979 2018-10-15 21:00:47 @realDonaldTrump media claims Anytime there is a hurricane or tornado it’s climate change. We have had storms forever and some of them devastating and some not so much.  I think, Climate change is a hoax to destroy the oil and gas industry. Why can’t we utilize all energy.
1980 2018-10-15 21:00:45 His father was an oil executive and his mother worked in finance. So yeah, he's the worst
1981 2018-10-15 21:00:44 Just thinking aloud; How long will it take a serious government to build and compete a refinery?

In all truth, before now i could swear with my life that @MBuhari government will build a mega oil refinery for us in less than 2 years!

It's really sad that nothing has changed!

1991 2018-10-15 20:59:54 I'm pretty sure this is how its done in Japan (Tokyo?) because the oil has to go out with the trash. You add potato starch to the frying oil or the 魚焼きグリル (sakana yakiguriru.) You let it set up, peal it out and throw the whole block out.
1992 2018-10-15 20:59:52 Oil is a commodity. If Saudi turned off the taps, oil prices would quickly move into the $300 or $400 a barrel range. That impacts everybody on planet and all economies in a horrible way. Now they couldn’t do it for long as they need the revenue, but it would be damaging as hell.
1993 2018-10-15 20:59:42 And the U.S. can import oil from Mexico and Canada.

1995 2018-10-15 20:59:36 #resultsvsresistance 

 Dow - over a thousand less now than Jan 18! 

Oil - over $10 a barrel up since Jan 18!

 Wage growth YTD increase 2.7% YAY! 

Cost of living YTD increase 2.9% BOO! 

Deficit as % of GDP, 4.2% now.  3.4% last year!  

Tired of winning yet???
1996 2018-10-15 20:59:36 Do you think Pres Trump & US would impose Sanctions against Saudi Arabia for their involvement in the death of Wash Post Journalist at Saudi Consolate in Turkey?
Trump & US depend on Saudi Arabia for "Oil" & is a Middle East Ally of ourse
1997 2018-10-15 20:59:27 Keep lying for the “King” gotta keep that oil flowing our way! Traitor
1998 2018-10-15 20:59:23 Gotta change my oil this week, bout tht time
1999 2018-10-15 20:59:09 That's fair. If he stays healthy, bust out that anointing oil.
2000 2018-10-15 20:59:07 Going along means taking the drugs, believing dogma, thinking that the doctors have any clue what they're doing when it all a sham. They might as well be selling snake oil, but the ingenious part is that the side effects cause more need for multiple diagnosis. We're disposable.

2002 2018-10-15 20:58:58 it wouldn’t, unless you want to be paying $100, possibly over $200 for a barrel of oil
2003 2018-10-15 20:58:56 Wouldn’t it be pollution. Because of the oil and the fumes they put into the air and if I’m right can I get a free sub :) lmao
2004 2018-10-15 20:58:30 Gas prices do not move based on who's in the WH- in this instance the entire rise since 2016 is thanks to OPEC changing policy at its Nov 2016 meeting since oil prices dropped to multi-year lows. They cut production to boost prices.
2005 2018-10-15 20:58:22 Awww, good to know. All this talk of domestic production made me think imports were just for storage. No weaning off Saudi oil then! The West had better shut up already then!
2006 2018-10-15 20:58:21 But JCOPA gave us all this new Iranian oil on the world markets! That would only be fucked up if Trump...oh, right.
2007 2018-10-15 20:58:20 Interesting tidbits.
It took him about 8 years to put 1 million miles on his truck. 
He cannot go in reverse.

2008 2018-10-15 20:58:20 Clearly Hillary Clinton wasn’t the more or most realistic option because in the end she didn’t win. I would think, doesn’t take oil money would be the baseline not a fantasy when people are already suffering because of climate change.
2009 2018-10-15 20:58:09 After washing and conditioning I do, leave in conditioner, an oil, curling creams/gel, then I finger coil it with eco styled gel
2010 2018-10-15 20:57:57 Dues to Saudi involvement in providing 9/11 terrorists, we now wait in long lines at airport security. We don't need your gas or your money. In fact, we shouldn't accept your oil or your money.

2020 2018-10-15 20:57:11 It’s not about fear..... It’s about the fact that outside of Israel they are our only help in the Mid East when it comes to Iran.... Who’s our biggest enemy.... Also oil..... We can’t jump start a beef that may mess up this growing economy..... Let’s finish investigation first.
2021 2018-10-15 20:57:10 Didn't almost all of the 9/11 Hijackers come from Saudi Arabia??? The sooner the US moves away from foreign oil towards clean energy, the sooner we can kick Saudi Arabia to the curb...

2034 2018-10-15 20:56:12 Here is my understanding of VENOM from fanart and memes on social media:
A dude that had never did laundry like ever fucks an oil spill that is occasionally a cute plushie-like creature but mostly just out there eating junk food
2035 2018-10-15 20:56:09 Oil and gas main to aisa koi issue ni hota. Its the best employment available
2036 2018-10-15 20:56:08 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever. Psalm 23: 5-6 (KJV)
2037 2018-10-15 20:56:05 At present we don’t since we are now a net exporter of crude oil and natural gas.
2038 2018-10-15 20:55:50 You remember, like the ones we had when we were kids. Now they were proper brexits. Hmm, proper bendy brexits that smell of engine oil. Not like this crappy new fangled brexit. And they were bigger!
I blame @BoyaPugh . (probably).
2039 2018-10-15 20:55:49 As expected, Warren and Franklin both opt out of the 5A playoffs. GM and Oil City will face off in the championship game.

2041 2018-10-15 20:55:39 The best thing the Saudis could do is cut their oil exports to zero. 

Then they can go on a diet of sand.

They are just as hooked on hard currency as the West is on crude.
2042 2018-10-15 20:55:39 Not likely. Canada is the 4th largest oil producing nation earth: America is our ally. We can step up and fill the Saudi oil gap in a heartbeat.
2043 2018-10-15 20:55:37 They have shooting range deals on Groupon for LA and even CBD products from vaping to oil lmao

2054 2018-10-15 20:54:39 I'm sure that Saudis are shaking in their boots. They know that West relies on them for oil, cash, military bases, antagonising Iran and betraying Islam. They're laughing all the way to the bank.
2055 2018-10-15 20:54:27 I agree about hangover in the sense that much of it is about the profits from the Middle Eastern oil, most of which can't be used due to global warming, but military spending is usually lower than France, Greece and Portugal similarly high, Poland not far behind - imperialist?

2062 2018-10-15 20:54:05 That oil won’t matter come next month, sanctions on Iranian oil mean that the Saudis pretty much get to decide the price as if they don’t cover the supply from the Iranians then the price of oil is just gonna keep rising
2063 2018-10-15 20:54:05 Clearly the CIA killed him so we have an excuse to get their oil

2067 2018-10-15 20:53:37 Canada can easily step in and fill the gap Saudi oil blackmail would cause. America need only increase its imports....safe, secure, allied oil. But those $40-50 million pieces of silver Trump personally collects for his company from the Saudi human rights abusers get in the way.
2068 2018-10-15 20:53:36 What happened to the 400-pound guy?  How much snake oil does this side-show barker  think we’re willing to swallow?

2073 2018-10-15 20:53:16 Not buying oil from Saudia Arabia would do wonders for our environment. It would force America to find and use cleaner and cheaper fuels. Perhaps we would all live longer.
2074 2018-10-15 20:53:09 I remembered, a few months ago, you said, the King agreed your requirements about decreasing the price of oil. Does he did that?
2075 2018-10-15 20:53:08 The day of the electric vehicle is upon our doorstep. Another oil crisis would only open the door wide
2076 2018-10-15 20:53:07 Give it up. Once a year we get girl guide cookies. We all had them as kids. Stop putting a damper on this well deserving tradition. The little bit of oil per cookie will not kill anyone.
2077 2018-10-15 20:52:58 What if Saudi retaliates by selling oil in Euros, RMB, etc? Need to factor petrodollar system into leverage analysis

I’ll be ordering the oil soon too since I missed it

2081 2018-10-15 20:52:30 Hey Ted, I’m an oil man with a stake in the Permian basin. Don’t think you or he will help or hurt efforts to frack all that black gold out of the ground. It’s a lot bigger than either of you.
2082 2018-10-15 20:52:26 try taking it with primrose oil!
2083 2018-10-15 20:52:21 Welcome to the film and oil and gas industry.  Get over yourself, it's not the most difficult thing and I'm sure it's under safer conditions than working on a rig.
2084 2018-10-15 20:52:17 Gotta get some more wax & oils 4 my oil burner
2085 2018-10-15 20:52:13 @waitrose when are you going to stop using palm oil in your products? I was shocked to see it in your list of ingredients in the lunchtime wraps, in the sandwich section. I refuse to buy products with palm oil in, so I left and bought my lunch from another shop!
2086 2018-10-15 20:52:10 Please focus on the main topic, You said Saudi wont effect the USA economy we’re not talking about debt the usa debt is very high, if saudi decides to cut all oil shipments the oil price would rise to 200$ it will effect global economy not only American
2087 2018-10-15 20:52:07 Stop using palm oil. You know about the deforestation and inevitable extinctions. It's worth the price to make more profit, though!?!
2088 2018-10-15 20:52:06 You know Axl, hopefully Trump's brass tactics will include his being bold enough to stand up to the Saudis. No one ever does because of their enormous wealth, power and oil. Someone sure needs to finally!
2089 2018-10-15 20:52:01 Trump doesn't want Saudi to stop buying Us weapons,Higher oil price and allow a Russian military base in Saudi.
2090 2018-10-15 20:51:58 Think about it. Would they though. Sanctions from US EU basically every nation depends on Saudi oil.  Freeze assets. They've got leverage no doubt but so do the G20 of it became a tit4tat. 1/2
2091 2018-10-15 20:51:58 I'm not a "war for oil" kinda guy but let's be honest. If Saudi Arabia played hardball enough with oil that they would "cripple economies worldwide" there would be American and European boots on the ground in Riyadh within 2 weeks.
2092 2018-10-15 20:51:50 Another #lightningquick service @Pro_Oil_Change #Bracebridge .  Didn’t even finish my #complimentary hot chocolate before they were done. #theseguysarefast
2093 2018-10-15 20:51:49 What about the palm oil chain?
2094 2018-10-15 20:51:49 Because they don’t have a choice. The crazy thing is after this they won’t be punished by anyone is my guess. I hope I’m wrong.
Money and Oil rule
2095 2018-10-15 20:51:49 Do not buy Saudi oil .. Sell your car .. Go to your work by bike .. It is simple .. But you are more than killing innocents on the face of the earth you are real terrorism
2096 2018-10-15 20:51:44 We were told US had so much oil, it was now okayed to sell it. We were told the majority of our oil came from the US.
2097 2018-10-15 20:51:34 Breathing in vaporized oil all day just fucking me up more and worsening this cough dred :/
2098 2018-10-15 20:51:29 That would just be shooting themselves in the foot. Commodities are traded in US dollars because it’s the most liquid and easily-converted currency there is. Besides, even if they did switch to the Euro, the worst that would happen would be a temporary rise in crude oil prices.
2099 2018-10-15 20:51:25 It is no secret at allthat the fossil fuel industry is antiquated and on its way out whether they like it or not. I say this being an analyst in theining industry...serving cement and oil...im riding the death wave until I can find better.

2102 2018-10-15 20:51:13 Yeah and they got tge details drastically wrong. Instead of rolling in oil money they have a £16 billion black hole.
2103 2018-10-15 20:51:10 house hit 55 degrees today so i called the oil company to fill our tank so we can turn on the heat. told the woman we haven’t had hot water since we moved here in june. she sounded so concerned that i think she’s gonna send the police to do a wellness check on us

2107 2018-10-15 20:51:00 Because oil price volatility would seem to correlate with current account volatility and, at least according to Indian financial press, GDP growth volatility. Shifting to less volatile energy generation would seem a no-brainer. But you are my guru sensei; I am ready to learn
2108 2018-10-15 20:50:54 This man just changed my oil for $20 instead of $75
2109 2018-10-15 20:50:51 Take coconut oil and biotin supplements! That stuff brings my hair back to life and makes it feel thick and soft instead of brittle and dry.
2110 2018-10-15 20:50:49 That is because the consensus of the industry was to go south and that only changed after the shale oil boom. How about deal with the reality today @SohiAmarjeet
2111 2018-10-15 20:50:44 Firstly, Saudi oil is a relatively small portion of what goes into US gas tanks now (thank you, fracking boom), and secondly, if we dump it, all that happens is electric cars come online even faster. Our cities get cleaner and quieter and the Arabs get a better shot at freedom.

2113 2018-10-15 20:50:37 @LiveCBDHealthy would you have any suggestions as to what to do for a non-cannabis user who would maybe want to try CBD oil? How to use? What potency? Benefits?
2114 2018-10-15 20:50:34 Watching porn on my phone while waiting for my oil change at Jiffy Lube.
2115 2018-10-15 20:50:23 David, you are correct in that the House of Saud needs the USA for them to remain in power but we & the world really need their billions of barrels of oil each and every day to function. If their was a change in regime/new Government their would be massive upheaval economically.
2116 2018-10-15 20:50:14 America never needed Saudi oil. ME oil is for Europe, to prevent dependence on Russian energy.
2117 2018-10-15 20:50:13 Our CBD coffee is a Single Origin Costa Rican Blend infused with THC FREE CBD Oil, it is SO good!!!
2118 2018-10-15 20:50:09 George you might want to check into some discount fuel cards as it's a completely different price system And most of the time the cost plus style will save you up .25 or more cents off the pump price at times I got .45 off and at others it was the same depends on the oil  futures

2126 2018-10-15 20:49:19 How about looking to your Canadian Neighbours for Oil.  Alberta, where we depend on Oil production has the highest unemployment in the Country.  Give us a call - we can help!  @marcorubio @SenWarren @sarahkendzior

2130 2018-10-15 20:48:56 The recent events in Saudi Arabia act as a reminder of the brutal disgusting regime that the USA will anything to please so we can fulfill our oil fetish. For Shame
2131 2018-10-15 20:48:55 @georgegalloway In your view has the crown prince become a loose cannon, another Faisal? is another Saudi oil embargo possible and what about the Western foreigners residing in the
Region could they become political pawns? Is this why Trump is changing tune?

2134 2018-10-15 20:48:48 Starting 4th November 2018, India will send rice to Iran in the exchange of crude oil. With this modern form of the old fashioned barter system, our dependence on the American dollar will be less and our Indian rupee will get a new life.
#Transforming_India!
2135 2018-10-15 20:48:34 The media started publishing those stories because the UN said back in 2006, so 12 years ago that livestock was the leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions. Because those companies are responsible for creating oil which you use every time you turn on a light or drive.
2136 2018-10-15 20:48:33 And what about us pulling back on OUR OIL EXPORTS? Wouldn't that have a cushioning effect on the price of gasoline here?
2137 2018-10-15 20:48:29 How soon can we get Banksy to shred that horrific piece of canvas with oil colors? (Can’t call it art)

2140 2018-10-15 20:47:57 On our way home. Houston was a lovely place: the factories and oil refineries were so plentiful it looked like some sort of rusted dystopian wasteland... Which would sound bad to some, but I dug that aesthetic.
2141 2018-10-15 20:47:53 I can go along with that. I thought it was a little too much out in plain view. Still, Saudis are not our friends in any shape or form. Threatening to bring oil to 200 dollars should be enough to wake up in regards to that d1rtbag country. I still don’t trust the Dems at all  :-)
2142 2018-10-15 20:47:51 Cute. They are decimated. If you are going to pretend to be Intel, then dont pretend you do not know that they the Islamic State WAS a state with slave auctions and selling oil and now, they are so fucked up that not one person is wearing battle rattle in the picture.
2143 2018-10-15 20:47:51 Nothing to gain from letting oil/gasboys letting run amok like they have all over. YES ON 112!!

Trump saw the harm Our Trade Deals did to Manufacturing Workers, miners, oil drillers, & farmers.

2183 2018-10-15 20:43:54 Doesn’t this also kill the myth about us drilling makes us less dependent on foreign oil? It’s all sold on the global market. Please correct me if I’m wrong.
2184 2018-10-15 20:43:49 Im about to steal my sons coconut oil for my stretch marks. I was lucky to not get them on my stomach but literally the last week they appeared on my leg  they make it hard to even want to wear a one piece bathing suit or even shorts 
2185 2018-10-15 20:43:32 So you voted for someone who takes money from oil companies and promoted the natural gas industry globally as Secretary of State.

If we value life, why do we go out of our way to make things harder for the most vulnerable?
2196 2018-10-15 20:42:14 I need to go get a oil change 
2197 2018-10-15 20:42:09 I don't believe you're thinking this through all the way. Attacking KSA militarily is simply not an option for the US. It ain't gonna happen. If the KSA chooses to cease selling its oil exclusively in USD, dollar hegemony ends forthwith, never to return.
2198 2018-10-15 20:42:03 He's learning that all things are not what they appear to be particularly in the Mid-East.  Whoever did this wanted to make sure the world would blame Saudi Arabia--would SA have done this to itself as it tries to become more than an oil broker?

2207 2018-10-15 20:41:11 Nearly $1 BILLION lost per month!
Canada is selling it’s oil at approx $26US a barrel. West Texas sells it for $72US a barrel. But instead the gov. spends $4.5 billion on a non existent pipeline!  Can you do the math on how much we are losing out on?!
2208 2018-10-15 20:41:00 Apply ten drops of essential oil to a dry log. Allow the oil to permeate the wood for at least a couple of days before burning. Enjoy!

2211 2018-10-15 20:40:46 Annointing Oil Making Night...
2212 2018-10-15 20:40:43 you use 1 (one!!!) tsp of vegetable oil to cook for ~15 minutes and the smell really just lingers in your apartment for the rest of the day ://
2213 2018-10-15 20:40:33 A high oil price will have a double-edged effect, I think. Oil majors will prosper immensely in the short term but the cost at the pumps will push investors to pour more money into renewables and electric vehicles tech.
2214 2018-10-15 20:40:24 Good evening your Highness.
The Gusher is looking good. 
2215 2018-10-15 20:40:17 Their swing production capacity allows them to drive the price of oil up or down.  It’s a power more potent than nuclear weapons (though they have those in Pakistan).
2216 2018-10-15 20:40:15 The only way is up?
2217 2018-10-15 20:40:12 Let them. Will hasten the demise of oil and help end our dependence on it, maybe giving us a chance to delay the climate collapse. #IPCCReport

2228 2018-10-15 20:39:39 Saudi Arabia executes people for atheism, homosexuality, blasphemy. Why such outrage over a death of a journalist, and not others? Media wants to put Trump in a box where he has to choose between $200 oil and economic collapse & then blame him, or make him look indifferent.

It's a major decision, millions work in the gas/oil industries.

Are jobs more important?

2256 2018-10-15 20:37:37 As a teenager with a drivers license,Sears has a dark side. My father would do mechanic work on weekends and if I was one minute late for curfew he would wake me up on Saturday mornings at 6:30 to get him a case of oil on sale like the pipeline was going to run dry by 7:00 am. 
2257 2018-10-15 20:37:28 did an oil change on my car on Saturday BY MYSELF for the first time so I feel hella fucking cool

This is a huge American foreign policy flaw and it has been for some time now. 
And that’s not to dismiss trump supporting them.
2261 2018-10-15 20:36:58 These are some of the things Joy FM have been  paid to divert our attention from.

2272 2018-10-15 20:36:00 Worse they can take payment for their oil in currency other than the dollar.
2273 2018-10-15 20:35:59 You could also just lightly mist your hair with water then follow up with an oil/butter.
2274 2018-10-15 20:35:55 They want to drive up oil price and they hedged by investing in electric car makers, tell me how this isn’t a win win for Saudi Arabia?
2275 2018-10-15 20:35:55 can’t upset big oil, gas gonna be $17/gallon
2276 2018-10-15 20:35:51 It was great thanks
2277 2018-10-15 20:35:47 Looks like oil's well for you!
2278 2018-10-15 20:35:45 Trump prepped us for this with "rogue operators" theory.  Throw some low-level operatives under the bus and this all goes away, because Saudis paid off the Turks and Trump doesn't want to offend his oil sheik benefactors. Small price for MBS to pay for getting rid of a critic.
2279 2018-10-15 20:35:42 Love that song . Nearly tweeted it when the 2nd tanker rolled in.
2280 2018-10-15 20:35:34 I hope they take my Truck in the dealership and do the damn oil change already ive been waiting 3 days 
2281 2018-10-15 20:35:33 Neither of us are dependant on Saudi oil, and the US is the biggest oil producer. But the US needs Saudis to keep the petro dollar and back them as world currency. Otherwise the US would need to live within their means and could not just print more money.
2282 2018-10-15 20:35:24 Middle of your back definitely!!! Well I’m gonna see if olive oil will sweet me like it’s doing you

2298 2018-10-15 20:33:46 well we have option #1 sanction them and oil will go to $200 per barrel and you can then blame Trump for a recession. #2 Bomb them into the stone age and have another country that will be $20 trillion in blood and treasure to rebuild and you can blame Trump for an unwinnable war
2299 2018-10-15 20:33:32 Canada and US have been a pretty good friends over the years, and we have lots of oil and natural gas up here if you wanted to be strategic about where you source your energy.

2304 2018-10-15 20:33:12 $1600/mo for gas per vehicle, vs $200 electricity and $1000 car payments for electric vehicles.

Once people go electric, they don't switch back.

Trump is deciding if he should end the oil industry, by going along with the false flag story as fake as the gas attacks...

2307 2018-10-15 20:32:49 I think the previous administration tried to get us off our dependency on foreign oil by exploring new energy sources.

2332 2018-10-15 20:31:11 The fix is in. Low-level operatives get thrown under bus and this all goes away because Turks have been paid off, and Trump doesn't want to upset his oil sheik benefactors.

2335 2018-10-15 20:31:02 $2500? I guess the Dallas news reported "...accepts transfers from joint fundraising committees"

2340 2018-10-15 20:30:46 It's very simple. Every time you walk or bike, you are firing a bullet at the regime in Saudi Arabia. It's patriotism. Let's the OPECS keep their oil
2341 2018-10-15 20:30:45 I wish I were as good at research as Joanna Newsom like when she said “my heart is heavy as an oil drum” even looking for a video of somebody next to an oil drum took me three hours to find
2342 2018-10-15 20:30:43 That oil value doesn’t go to Westminster or an independent Scotland, only the tax on the profit on it goes to any government
2343 2018-10-15 20:30:43 Can we bomb them now and take their oil? Cool.
2344 2018-10-15 20:30:37 They are 'rogue' scientists so all is forgiven as long as they can sell US cheap oil.
2345 2018-10-15 20:30:36 nigga just tried to wax me for an oil change but I’m pretty so he giving it to me half off

2348 2018-10-15 20:30:18 UPC would have pulled out of the carbon plan immediately, without Alberts the carbon tax is done. The UPC would have also turned the oil off. Evidence is the Lougheed days suggest they very well could have done that

2352 2018-10-15 20:30:08 Petrol is around $2.4 at the moment. Assuming no change in power rates, the ratio is now $36 to $45. Then assuming the barrel rate contribs ~35% to the pump price. Oil doubling would push the pump to ~$3.2. Then the ratio is $36 to $58.
2353 2018-10-15 20:29:56 I've been through many meds, except botox, and I'm now just on the CBD oil and occasional sumatriptan. It takes some time to play with dosage, but there many good resources to read more about it.

2355 2018-10-15 20:29:44 Just like water and oil

2358 2018-10-15 20:29:33 #AlbertaOilPatch #AlbertaOilSands - oil world price is $72 a barrel - Alberta price $16 a barrel - since it takes 3 barrels fresh water to produce 1 barrel of bitumen - forget selling the oil - sell the fresh water to US which they want & keep oil in ground til prices increase.

2365 2018-10-15 20:29:19 Oil.
2366 2018-10-15 20:29:14 It's not quite accurate. Diesel engines can run on fossil fuel-based diesel, straight vegetable oil (SVO) or biodiesel (modified SVO). There are places whose trucks are running on used cooking oils. In some cities, buses have hybrid engines - electric/biodiesel.
2367 2018-10-15 20:29:14 Unfortunately it is. Let's also not forget that the celebrity in chief claimed our #1 source of foreign oil (Canada) yet will let the Saudis pass. I seem to remember campaign adds saying how much tougher he was going to be compared to his opponent
2368 2018-10-15 20:29:09 When at the same time they're using oil to get there
2369 2018-10-15 20:29:07 And you know what, those companies aren’t going to change. We can change our behavior, we can reduce how much we depend on oil and travel etc but they’re not going to change or be held responsible.

2371 2018-10-15 20:29:05 Getting my oil changed at a new spot. Is 60$ normal? I never pay for this!
2372 2018-10-15 20:29:03 From a rogue state, yep.  Saudi Arabia is a repressive theocratic autocracy with religious police, massive subjugation of women, and oil.  That last is the only reason we don’t call it a state sponsor of terror.
2373 2018-10-15 20:29:02 Yes, I know - and watched the show dutifully for it - but many don't, which is why I posted the actual real reference. Not much was done when it happened, since just about every country didn't want to criticise KSA, being dependant on Saudi oil.
2374 2018-10-15 20:28:59 Et je ferais un essai de tournesol en 2019. En tant qu’agriculteur je suis déjà confronté au RCA et j’essaie de m’y adapté. J’aimerais faire un bilan carbone de ma ferme et aller vers le 0 carbone. Quand proposez vous ça ?
2375 2018-10-15 20:28:58 It appears “nothing compares to a little warm olive oil for a build of wax and don’t use cotton buds, they’re bad for the environment and your ears”....might be a bit of a mouthful.

2377 2018-10-15 20:28:47 What?  Illustrated by a picture of a man who is using public money to sustain the building of a pipeline for the dirtiest, most polluting grade of oil there is?  I don’t think so.
2378 2018-10-15 20:28:40 Still waiting for congress to pressure oil and gas to lower gasoline prices. It’s hurting the economy. We put up with the higher priced crappy summer blend and now it’s fall and the public is being gouged!! Do your jobs!

2382 2018-10-15 20:28:10 They know that Trump needs them for balancing oil supply becuase of Iran sanctions, they know Trump needs them for weapons deal, they know Trump needs them to realize his dream of striking a deal in Palestine. Trump pinned his plan on the Saudis and they used him .@nytimes
2383 2018-10-15 20:28:05 Boycott ALL Saudi oil....buy ARCO (Atlantic Richfield from N. Atlantic)...cheaper...BOYCOTT in travel, products, both Russia and Saudi Arabia. Boycott Trump hotels, properties, condos, golf courses. @McFaul

2388 2018-10-15 20:27:39 I’m sorry, but who votes? Who buys oil? Who supports these companies? Stop passing the blame on to someone else.
2389 2018-10-15 20:27:37 The Saudis killed an American journalist and don't forget they helped to finance 911 and are culpable in destroying Syria.  How are they still our allies?  This is the consequence of reliance on oil. #SaudiArabia #BigOil #MiddleEast
2390 2018-10-15 20:27:35 I'm capable of parsing all this bullshit and pointing out that Russia may have attempted to directly meddle with our election. They also have one oil powered aircraft carrier.
2391 2018-10-15 20:27:29 So nice of Walmart to vacuum out my car while they change my oil. BLESS YALL
2392 2018-10-15 20:27:28 Ahead of the coming #EIAReport, the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) shed another 1.1 million barrels over the past week down to 657.6 million. This is taxpayer oil that is sold to commercial entities; hence added to commercial storage/use. #OOTT
2393 2018-10-15 20:27:26 What was the price of the oil shipped . ? I can see it was 1500 bottles shipped
2394 2018-10-15 20:27:13 Yes my grandpa did check my tire pressure, oil, and gas before he left me leave his house
2395 2018-10-15 20:27:12 why the fuck an oil change gotta be so damn expensive
2396 2018-10-15 20:26:59 Donald Trump has said he won't cut off the agreement. Saudi Arabia is just waiting in the corner for US to impose sanctions and they would decrease their oil supply.
2397 2018-10-15 20:26:58 So now Saudi knows what happened when before they said they have no clue? Nice. No accountability because we drive cars that use oil and we're not about to give that up, are we?
2398 2018-10-15 20:26:57 My early oil inv projections - Crd -2.7,Gasoline -1.8, Dist - 1.7, Runs - 0.4 total combined stocks lower on the week.@DTNOilandGas
2399 2018-10-15 20:26:42 I just wanna be lazy all day but I need to go get my oil changed 
2400 2018-10-15 20:26:35 Unless, of course, they are brown and in foreign countries , especially those that have oil.....
2401 2018-10-15 20:26:33 Once we are IN, there's no turning back. All we have to do is to adapt or mitigate by using "alternatives to oil."
2402 2018-10-15 20:26:32 What did @VitalforColo have to say when asked about the men, women, and children who had to live by the oil wells, breathe the toxin filled air, and drink the cancer chemical water caused by fracking? Here's a direct quote: "Fuck those people, more money for big Oil and Gas."
2403 2018-10-15 20:26:29 Steroid-laced "natural products". Snake oil.

You’ve taxed the middle class on your “social licensing” yet no pipelines to tide waters, you did nothing for energy east & now you’re doing the same with TMX. You’ve accomplished nothing in energy & you’re responsible for losing energy jobs & 44 million a day in oil export
2407 2018-10-15 20:26:18 Are we concerned enough to build enwrgy East pipeline, so we don't import Saudi Oil?
2408 2018-10-15 20:26:11 We’re not dependent on SA for anything. Their threats are toothless. The worst they can do is cause crude oil prices to rise for a few months until it’s high enough to make it worthwhile for US oil producers to start pumping again.
2409 2018-10-15 20:26:01 Who cares about being number one or two in oil production. The sooner we switch to renewables and electric cars the better the outcome for the planet, our economy’s future and security.
2410 2018-10-15 20:25:58 Oh yes you do need Algebra 2. How much can you earn cooking, sewing, changing oil and tires?  How much can you make doing accounting, coding, nursing, on and on and on. STUDY, or be left behind.

2412 2018-10-15 20:25:43 This group has drafted well in middle rounds but we shall see what comes of it. Too early to say.
2413 2018-10-15 20:25:43 They have to give birth to joanoz again and start rubbing the oil from scratch
2414 2018-10-15 20:25:23 Do they have that old oil and wet clothes smell?
2415 2018-10-15 20:25:21 We buy oil from them, so they can lend money to Donald and Jared.
2416 2018-10-15 20:25:17 They’re lucky, wells of oil are in good weather conditions and surrounding of green grass. in GCC only dust and open area of desert
2417 2018-10-15 20:25:15 The KSA serves a multitude of purposes. It provides cheap oil, always sold in dollars. It’s Iran’s neighbor, meaning the US can base troops there. On top of its massive arms purchases, it’s also a useful idiot to do DC’s political and military bidding.

2421 2018-10-15 20:25:02 How is your oil supply holding up?

2431 2018-10-15 20:24:10 Saudia cannot treath Trump with anything. Oil is not a argument anymore.
2432 2018-10-15 20:24:10 On it with the ginger tea. Only have tea tree oil at home. Let me try it with that. Thanks boo!
2433 2018-10-15 20:24:02 I don't look forward to the conversation where I have to explain what my license plate means to the very slow man (for lack of better terms, I'm sorry) while I sit waiting for my oil change to finish.
2434 2018-10-15 20:23:57 So far, oil market not building in any upside price risk from SA issue, but it is still early in the investigation. On many fronts the next directional move in oil prices will  be driven by the many evolving geopolitical issues bubbling up around the world.@DTNOilandGas
2435 2018-10-15 20:23:53 Yes this is true but only 9% of our oil comes from Saudi, we really don’t need their oil.
2436 2018-10-15 20:23:48 Tralalala. After so many conflicting statements it will not be easy for them to cover up such a thing. Another, even more interesting factor is the cracks that so quickly revealed between SA and US. Blackmail with oil prices is a hit this season, I think
2437 2018-10-15 20:23:43 It's oil rigged.

Unemployment lowest in 40 yrs, wages growing, taxes lowered 4 middle class.
2440 2018-10-15 20:23:30 Saudis must focus on pumping out 2m barrel oil more for few months, release oil from inventory/strategic reserves , just bring down prices to $50. Nobody would bother about journalists and stuff... #Khashoggi
2441 2018-10-15 20:23:25 Starting 4th November 2018, India will send rice to Iran in the exchange of crude oil. With this modern form of the old fashioned barter system, our dependence on the American dollar will be less and our Indian rupee will get a new life. Modi magic transforming India!

2447 2018-10-15 20:23:04 Good governance in Africa is cyclical. In 1990, Nigeria began using auctions to allocate oil blocks.

2464 2018-10-15 20:22:18 Like I said, it's not about Saudi oil, it's more about Trump making money directly from Saudi's - read a couple of the posts above from @ForeverLogical and you'll understand better.
2465 2018-10-15 20:22:15 Folks,
Enough with the fossil fuels and vegetable oil, we gotta learn to harness the earth’s bounty of lava and magma for our own purposes. Surely we can find a way to use lava in a similar manner to hydrothermic power.

2469 2018-10-15 20:21:45 As upgrading to a nice stainless steel exhaust too can be acceptable. As long as it's not the diameter of the Trans-Alaskan oil pipeline.

2470 2018-10-15 20:21:41 How many oil changes?
2471 2018-10-15 20:21:35  na engine oil
2472 2018-10-15 20:21:31 Because nivea Q10 ..my skim has never been this happy. Of course I I mix it with essential oil (magnolia tissue oil, olive oil, castor oil, glycerine, coconut oil and spirit)
2473 2018-10-15 20:21:29 He is stressed to live with, he will measure rice, garri and vegetable oil anything and everything, you will be frustrated, see just know what you want to go into. Ahahah sis DON'T
2474 2018-10-15 20:21:27 How forgetful shep is, he says it would be down right disgusting if Trump let’s Saudi get away with killing journalists, we’ll what did obama do when ISIS beheaded oh I’m sorry let them stick around didn’t go after them and let them make money selling oil, wouldn’t bomb tankers
2475 2018-10-15 20:21:21 When the ticket prices went up at IMS and lot of fans complained, I found that the average seat at a Colts game was MORE than the average seat for the 500, and concessions much higher at Lucas Oil. I don't grasp that value proposition.
2476 2018-10-15 20:21:18 shoutout to the guy who changed my oil who was incredibly kind and patient with me even after he asked me to flash my brights and I turned on my windshield wipers 
2477 2018-10-15 20:21:18 Oil companies drill a hole, take stuff out of the Earth that they don't own. And sell it to consumers.

When the stuff is used, it destroys the Earth. I claim that's bad for consumers.

And they take no responsibility for the destruction caused by the use of the stuff they sold.
2478 2018-10-15 20:21:04 When you stop driving except with gas made from oil that you produced from your own property, I'll take a listen to what you are saying.  You are totally ignorant of intertwined economies. Canceling a fucking WRESTLING SHOW is not part of real diplomacy, #WWECrownJewel
2479 2018-10-15 20:21:02 You are 100% a lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist. You a so weak willed and lack any conviction. #magats
2480 2018-10-15 20:21:01 The king is blowing smoke and you will kiss his ass for the price of weapons and oil. Weak on terror. Weak on dictators. Just a weak excuse for a leader. If we roll over and accept this I know who won't get my votes.
2481 2018-10-15 20:20:57 Literally any way I can get them. Mushrooms roasted at high temp until a little crispy on the edges with thyme and a bit of salt and olive oil are wonderful. Mushroom pate is so good too.
2482 2018-10-15 20:20:53 They’re responsible for producing oil. Which is easier for you, giving up meat or giving up driving?
2483 2018-10-15 20:20:50 Too pricey to fix .... meaning all my $ in oil coal etc would be compromised and I’ll be dead before mar a lago is under water so why should I care
2484 2018-10-15 20:20:47 Is it British with the standard issue huge oil leak?
2485 2018-10-15 20:20:44 What kind of chips go best with tripe? Double dip? Triple dip? Sheep dip? Type of fat? Beef suet, rapeseed oil, Boris Johnson? Type of salt? Himalayan? Tory? How many pounds? Choices choices

2491 2018-10-15 20:20:04 You sure say no be vegetable oil him use? 
2492 2018-10-15 20:19:58 What did @danhaleyCO say when asked about the men, women, and children who had to live by the oil wells, breathe the toxin filled air, and drink the cancer chemical filled water caused by fracking? Here's a direct quote: "Fuck those people, more money money money money for me."
2493 2018-10-15 20:19:55 You got the case of canola oil and the chains, right?
2494 2018-10-15 20:19:54 *america busts the door in* DID I HEAR OIL??!

2498 2018-10-15 20:19:38 Finally tried CBD oil and I’m not disappointed
2499 2018-10-15 20:19:28 The Saudi govt. tries to use plausible deniability to excuse a journalist being killed. Meanwhile Trump will do anything to keep getting their oil and selling them weapons. #Khashoggi
2500 2018-10-15 20:19:27 If I'm not Jewish, explain to me how I just had the brilliant idea of putting hummus, olive oil, and paprika on a toasted everything bagel

2503 2018-10-15 20:19:20 We don’t want to blame them without proof. The Saudis just threatened to raise oil to $200 a barrel. Also they help us to work against Iran.
2504 2018-10-15 20:19:19 Ha.  Nothing. Scared of through the roof oil prices!!
2505 2018-10-15 20:19:07 Me too. I have developed pretty bad anxiety this year for various reasons. I did a little research and purchased some oil that I put on my tongue. I feel like a different person.
2506 2018-10-15 20:19:03 You don't mean it Tunde use beard oil for 4 years 
2507 2018-10-15 20:18:59 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
2508 2018-10-15 20:18:53 I have reported Oil and Litter dumling outside a business but nothing has been done about it. Please i just want my city clean. I have a number incident report #
2509 2018-10-15 20:18:43 good thing trumpty wants to keep us dependent on oil...

2511 2018-10-15 20:18:39 She rides the unicorns everyday for their votes  And when she tanked the oil and gas industry she attacked farmers and bet all her chips on micro breweries who have a high successful rate. Then she banned door to door sales after hiring an Ontario company to hand out lightbulbs

2513 2018-10-15 20:18:33 have you tried castor oil?
2514 2018-10-15 20:18:31 Not really. It starts as an infused oil with black pepper and kochukaru then is blended with gochujang, soy sauce, kimchi, cider vinegar, honey, and Frank’s Red Hot.
2515 2018-10-15 20:18:29 After 4 years of beard oil, what of ur mustache Tunde 
2516 2018-10-15 20:18:26 Do you keep all your oil receipts? For a Honda!
2517 2018-10-15 20:18:22 My husband uses Oil of Olay though he'd never admit it.
2518 2018-10-15 20:18:13 Obviously the fuel oil is no longer radioactive from exposure to Operation Crossroads nuclear tests.
2519 2018-10-15 20:18:10 My white uncle always used to say to us kids “ The Squeaky wheel, always gets the oil “ or some shit like that.... , guess I get it now. 

Congrats Bruh.
2520 2018-10-15 20:18:04 I’ll tell u the bigger problem:  we aren’t hitting on draft picks. Aside from 97 (can’t miss) and 29 there doesn’t appear to be any stars.
2521 2018-10-15 20:17:57 You forgot oil
2522 2018-10-15 20:17:54 Honda of Owingsmills My 2 year old Honda Civic with 47k miles the  Cam Bearings went up. Honda says they will not cover  I didn't  change my oil enough. Is every 5k miles with full synthetic not enough  for a new Honda. I change the oil myself and didn't keep all  receipts.
2523 2018-10-15 20:17:54 We need lobby groups to get this bill sponsored and passed ASAP . The demand for Marijuana Oil can’t be met by USA and Canada alone . Ekiti can be the pilot state for this project - this will create jobs and tax for government
2524 2018-10-15 20:17:52 currently looking for an oil plug 
2525 2018-10-15 20:17:51 I'm putting my morning lemon muffin on the oil filled heater now to warm it up instead, but the baked beans have to go in a Pyrex in the oven ;(
2526 2018-10-15 20:17:48 They’re oil companies.
2527 2018-10-15 20:17:44 Sorry Tom, I beg to differ. In order to effectively interview this fast talking snake oil salesman, one has to nail him on points of fact not feelings, opinions, or morals. There were some softball questions that he easily spun. Still, obviously a madman.
2528 2018-10-15 20:17:40 Fish you say? *Looking for kitchen knife and oil to fry cuz he's hungry*
2529 2018-10-15 20:17:31 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
2530 2018-10-15 20:17:28 Those are oil companies. Are you going to stop buying gasoline? Giving up meat is easier and has more impact because methane is a more potent green house gas.
2531 2018-10-15 20:17:16 idk who’s daughter needs to hear this but go get ur oil changed and tires rotated
2532 2018-10-15 20:17:11 Dish detergent or baby oil
2533 2018-10-15 20:17:08 @realDonaldTrump and the Saudi Prince are friends, but as soon as congress after Nov. punish the prince for murdering a resident & or citizen of The United States. Prince will slow oil shipments and trump credit he steal for the economy will suffer. @AP #Maddow #AmJoy
2534 2018-10-15 20:17:07 so they are going to raise the price of oil to comes to the United States only and not to Europe?
2535 2018-10-15 20:16:46 Let’s take this SA opportunity to stop buying their oil and stop selling them arms. Retrain all those Lockheed employees to build solar panels. I know, far fetched, but one can dream.

2538 2018-10-15 20:16:37 So I bought oil of oregano to battle this cold. Got one with garlic. That was a colossal error in judgment.
2539 2018-10-15 20:16:28 CBD oil has legit helped me big time
2540 2018-10-15 20:16:23 what if oil money were considered illegal gains

what if we took it all and put it all towards saving the frickin' world

what if it worked?
2541 2018-10-15 20:16:21 Where did you get the oil change done? If it was at the dealer they should know that info.
2542 2018-10-15 20:16:14 Check your Engine oil this morning.
2543 2018-10-15 20:16:13 The eco gel with black castor oil and flax seed oil is the only gel that doesn’t dry my hair out.
2544 2018-10-15 20:16:13 Some churches have become betting sites too they milk their congregation dry ,some have coined slogans like "kwachua baraka" they sell cooking oil dubbed as anointing oil.After betting comes betchurching #Bettingbait
2545 2018-10-15 20:16:13 Tensions over Khashoggi loom over oil market. People are not fools, this is obviously a murder committed by Saudis. The order came from the top . Sever action must take place
2546 2018-10-15 20:16:12 How this will go away, 
the West Will put economic sanction
 Saudi will stop oil production
Oil price goes up.
The west cave.
Saudi put a shame trial of some low level people.
Thing return to normal and Saudi cash keep flowing in western economy.
2547 2018-10-15 20:16:11 Correct me if I'm wrong but I was under the impression that the Canadian Taxpayers Federation was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Oil & Gas Industry who receive more government subsidies than anyone. Shouldn't they be allowed to fail too?
2548 2018-10-15 20:16:10 Yeah nothing to do with US military using more oil than anyone else, or so many planes hazing up the skies with pollution  greenhouse
2549 2018-10-15 20:16:02 You're film twitter darling number one until you get strapped by an oil spill
2550 2018-10-15 20:16:00 Ngige with due  respect, it would've been better for you not to partake from this drug called APC its like red oil,you can't touch it without getting stained. You refers to your people  complaints as  "cry of contractors".
2551 2018-10-15 20:15:51 There are other factors. Spheres of influence, control of trade routes / market access, control of non-oil resources, etc. 

BUT: oil is the basis of our current society. We depend on it for (almost) all transportation and plastic-based products. 

It is THE strategic resource.
2552 2018-10-15 20:15:51 the world would do just fine with out them and their blood oil
2553 2018-10-15 20:15:47 Need to go get a oil change. I just don’t wanna go spend no money
2554 2018-10-15 20:15:46 Whip together 1 pound zucchini with 11 lbs kidney beans. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Fry. Serve warm.
2555 2018-10-15 20:15:46 Ok lets pretend this was palm oil then
2556 2018-10-15 20:15:37 I need to air my tires and get an oil change but the weather is not making that happen
2557 2018-10-15 20:15:28 So for those who trade futures or spot Brent crude oil, you should be shorting the hell out of Brent. With this latest scandal involving Saudi, one of the leverages the US will use to support the regime will be a promise to drop oil prices.  Put options at 68 will rake in cash 
2558 2018-10-15 20:15:20 My friend, if only it were five years...have a feeling it will cost this organization much more than that.

2561 2018-10-15 20:15:18 or is that oil sands orthodontics? i forget
2562 2018-10-15 20:15:17 Is that why u are supporting who u called a thief now?

You set our democracy on a very wrong path of corruption and that is what this government is correcting.

You are just fighting for ur selfish interest, ur oil blok licence isn't renewed, your 3rd force failed, frustration
2563 2018-10-15 20:15:02 If true, on of the best plays will be to short $BA and other defense stocks... we'll have to stop all those $billions on new defense orders... Then the Saudis own about $160 billion in Treasuries... and, don;t even talk about oil... very market unfriendly
2564 2018-10-15 20:15:01 Stop calling him a businessman. It’s embarrassing. He was given $500M and failed to do much with it. He would have been better off putting it in the market and taking up oil painting.
2565 2018-10-15 20:14:48 @NAkufoAddo, has charged the Ministry of Energy, the Petroleum Commission, #GNPC and the Licensing Rounds Committee to co-operate and ensure that activities under the maiden oil and gas licensing round are carried out in a transparent and efficient manner. #TheChangeWeVotedFor
2566 2018-10-15 20:14:43 I just got a free oil change 
2567 2018-10-15 20:14:43 What’s it called? I just use coconut oil!
2568 2018-10-15 20:14:42 Don't cry over spilled oil?
2569 2018-10-15 20:14:41 $ 405 million oil revenue missing

2571 2018-10-15 20:14:27 @saudiarabia Thank you for the threat of raising oil prices! That will be the gift that keeps on giving …… it's EXACTLY why USA needs to become energy independent!!!! Thank you again
2572 2018-10-15 20:14:10 @TheLeadCNN What exactly do you think the U.S. govt or President can do about the house of Saud?? Piss them off & let them force gas prices to $10 a gallon & destroy the economy. Seems our hands are tied they have the oil?
2573 2018-10-15 20:14:09 Petrol prices a fuckn joke , time the government demands 50% of cars be electric by certain date and set up refuelling, will make them much cheaper and kill oil prices
2574 2018-10-15 20:14:01 No one should show up! I’d make them choke on their oil . A country that still has sharia law and public executions is not a place anyone should do business with.

2576 2018-10-15 20:13:48 I found a patch that has thc and cbd in my dispensary. No lidocaine in it tho. They also have 3 or 4 different cbd/thc topical creams. But they r very   $$. I prefer the full spectrum oil that can b placed in a hot drink or on ur gums Very strong and works wonders!

2578 2018-10-15 20:13:32 Remember we were once informed that someone sold country's oil reserves... this might be a recovery strategy
2579 2018-10-15 20:13:31 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
2580 2018-10-15 20:13:21 "lol we have ur oil"
2581 2018-10-15 20:13:21 About 16%-19% of US oil consumption comes from imported oil (depending on which study you reference). About 40% of that is Saudi oil. We don't need it. We can quit it & not be impacted price wise. Don't let anyone tell you different.
2582 2018-10-15 20:13:19 Choke on your damn oil.
2583 2018-10-15 20:13:03 Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally of the United States against Russia, China and Iran. It is considered the leader of the Middle East and has great influence in all countries of the world and has the largest reserves of oil is not wise to lose
2584 2018-10-15 20:12:56 @Boomchickapop hey there! Do you know if your sunflower oil is either high- or mid-oleic? Thanks.
2585 2018-10-15 20:12:52 Dawisu knew what he signed for, ordinarily the bants won't hv bn much, but he has thrown a lot of stones while he lives in a glass house, so karma at it's best especially fr the kwankwasiyya guys
2586 2018-10-15 20:12:49 Actually I think it's getting embarrassing . The MMS keep holding the SP down while UKOG just keep sending out Tanker after tanker of oil. Aim is not doing its self any favours imo.
2587 2018-10-15 20:12:47 but qatar is an oil exporter too though ughhhhhhhhhhhh
2588 2018-10-15 20:12:42 Rogues sell oil.
2589 2018-10-15 20:12:34 Hey @RealDonad_Trump , if your Saudi oil starts to dry up I can think of somewhere a little closer you might want to look....but lets have a quick chat about aluminium and steel first.

2591 2018-10-15 20:12:29 Getting an oil change is the worse because I just have to sit at the car place until they’re done 
2592 2018-10-15 20:12:23 US isn't gonna do anything about that journalist. Oil is too valuable.
2593 2018-10-15 20:12:19 It's only when they run out of oil will they be called to account.
2594 2018-10-15 20:12:17 I am gonna say cusion foundation ? Or a liquid Glow oil?
2595 2018-10-15 20:12:05 Cover them in baby oil
2596 2018-10-15 20:11:58 I agree fire chia.  He’s single handedly set this franchise back five more years.
2597 2018-10-15 20:11:52 My mechanic says to never go there. They end up fixing a lot of the damage that jiffy lube causes. Not putting oil plugs back in, someone didn’t get a filter changed at all, and other issues. Go to a real mechanic not the cheap pull up and go places.
2598 2018-10-15 20:11:48 Here comes the Saudi PR to help Trump stuck between a rock and a oil addicted America with a fat defense sale hanging in Congress investment portfolios predictable .Arabs likely consider it domestic matter
.

2600 2018-10-15 20:11:39 No sane person thinks it's a hoax. The people who say they do are either getting paid by "big oil" or they're ignorant and purposely ignoring it. Everytime the weather person is on screen I hear home say its unseasonably hot today. I've heard them say that for 5 years now.

2602 2018-10-15 20:11:24 I had a horrible cold and I started taking 2 drops of oil of Oregano and mixing it with 6-7 drops of olive oil or coconut oil and putting it under your tounge. Works wonders!
2603 2018-10-15 20:11:12 Then shut down our competitors' oil supply first who don't care about human rights, let alone the environment
2604 2018-10-15 20:10:44 India and China are the ones who will decide Dollar fate in world trade, because dollar strength comes from oil trade, 60% of dollar trade being oil, 25% raw materials.Its naive to thing that dollar statut  as world currency is eternal.
2605 2018-10-15 20:10:43 Let's call a spade a spade here. Remember, this is the group that scouted Larsson and felt it was a good idea to give up Taylor Hall to acquire him.
2606 2018-10-15 20:10:42 Not how oil markets work.
2607 2018-10-15 20:10:35 The great world powers (and some regional ones) are all going to agree to minimise the blatant murder of a journalist so that oil can stay below $100.

That is where we are in 2018. I’m not shocked anymore but I will always be disgusted.

Thats being able to change the oil on your car n bring extra Good Food home for your family to those of us who work for a living. 
2611 2018-10-15 20:10:22 After drinking all the oil, they set it on fire. Ruto has to raise Harambee Stars 50M sadaka!
2612 2018-10-15 20:10:21 @The_DoctorV It's kind of a reach to say Venezuela's problems are because of socialism. It's corrupt & it's economy has bottomed out because of oil and foreign sanctions. Why not say your father had to wait for a heart because of capitalism?   #thinkcritically
2613 2018-10-15 20:10:21 I wish oil wasnt a fuel chemically.
2614 2018-10-15 20:10:18 Let's be honest, they could have executed & chopped him up on the Whitehouse lawn & still face no consequences. As long as they produce oil & buy weapons they'll be granted immunity from morality.
2615 2018-10-15 20:10:16 Abi red oil
2616 2018-10-15 20:10:16 Shipments of Libyan oil are already arriving in the U.S, revealing the real reason behind the bombing of Libya.

#SPAENG
2618 2018-10-15 20:10:09 Just the fact that a bunch of so-called leftists are eager to shift the blame for their carbon emissions to oil companies, tells me that there is no hope for preventing climate change. Even people who ostensibly understand the issue are able to rationalize away their contribution
2619 2018-10-15 20:10:05 When taking your vehicle in for service at Vandergriff Honda beware of techs joyriding in your car and when you talk to a manager he wants to throw a free oil change at u and say oh he was test driving the car. Exactly how do you test drive a car If it has not been fixed!!!
2620 2018-10-15 20:10:04 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.

2622 2018-10-15 20:09:59 Not quite. Remember, Turks said they have video and audio. They haven't released them for a reason. That "something", is worth way more than some oil or money. There are future gains to be had, by not releasing these, at this time. Saudis were very sloppy.
2623 2018-10-15 20:09:53 It's not about oil, mate, it's about money he (and Jared) gets from the Saudis
2624 2018-10-15 20:09:49 Saudi Arabia ....dangerous country to the planet earth & citizens of Earth.....with global warming ...almost in door steps of planet earth, soon food & water become more important than Saudi oil....Saudi family regime ...must go....Iranian cleric/mulla regime ..must go...
2625 2018-10-15 20:09:43 I’ve wondered about CBD oil because of the anti inflammatory thing!
2626 2018-10-15 20:09:39 Don't.. The roads are terrible
Schools are a joke.. I put my boy to private school as his was a joke
House prices are mad... Still not lot of oil work

2627 2018-10-15 20:09:34 Mr mbalula what is the story about reserve oil of the republick?

Was our reserve looted?

Pls clarify sir..
2628 2018-10-15 20:09:27 When their bottom six is the dog's breakfast it currently is, tinkering is what they should be doing. The issue is he doesn't have the stones to put the likes of Kassian on waivers to make room. Makes zero sense and if someone grabs Kassian, great...it moves the contract out.
2629 2018-10-15 20:09:21 They're pretty good guys.  They sell us oil, and spend at Trump Hotel.
2630 2018-10-15 20:09:20 Well if Saudis hold back their oil we might just use our own instead of shipping it elsewhere. Also we could elect to drive less.
2631 2018-10-15 20:09:19 My professor was making a comparison of how water and oil are LIKE liquids until he realized that they ARE liquids
2632 2018-10-15 20:09:01 Saudi Arabia threatens to cut oil production if the U.S. imposes sanctions for their murder of Khashoggi.

 Just sounds like all the more reason to go green. 

Imagine a world where foreign policy isn't entangled with oil interests. (Lol)
2633 2018-10-15 20:08:59 Odessa ain’t shit.... just because the oil show is happening doesn’t mean to fuck things up for the rest of us...
2634 2018-10-15 20:08:57 wheres the cheapest place to get your tires rotated? Also cheapest place for oil changes.
2635 2018-10-15 20:08:53 Oil products changed during tests, I'm sure.
2636 2018-10-15 20:08:39 Oil
2637 2018-10-15 20:08:26 @Tesla has no engine & no transmission. It has no spark plugs, fan belts, air filters, timing belts, or cylinder heads. never needs oil changes, tuneups, or emissions checks.
2638 2018-10-15 20:08:22 It’s actually loony. Have some warped people living and surviving on oil jobs in fort mc and who are so brainwashed by NDP that they want to end Oil sands projects and go windmills and bicycles .. Too much soy latte I say !! Makes their head into a sauce !!
2639 2018-10-15 20:08:04 do u have any suggestions for a "high quality" oil?
2640 2018-10-15 20:07:48 CBD oil
2641 2018-10-15 20:07:48 I literally have so many essential oil blend recipes lmao. I even have some for occasions. It’s your Anniversary, got a blend for that. You on your way to the club with your Girls, got an essential oil blend for that too. 
2642 2018-10-15 20:07:44 You are right.They don't know what a generator is or that their motors can be regeneratively slowed. You should email them to let them know. Don't forget about the heating.. (hint look at the oil color)
2643 2018-10-15 20:07:22 It's an edible oil product. 17 layers of quotation marks around edible, though.
2644 2018-10-15 20:07:20 Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. Founded in 2007 to take advantage of the oil discoveries and fracking opportunities in North Dakota and Montana. acquires, explores, and develops oil and gas properties. NOG stock has fallen since the heyday of the shale&fracking boom several years ago
2645 2018-10-15 20:07:10 I found the perfect essential oil combo

2651 2018-10-15 20:06:30 Ohio tryna ban CBD oil they really are the worst state along with us obviously.
2652 2018-10-15 20:06:28 Hey I hate chia more than most, but we can’t want him to pick up all scraps - maybe they scouted him or heard he’s not worth the time
2653 2018-10-15 20:06:21 They sure did. #Oil #Terrorism #USA
2654 2018-10-15 20:06:18 And most importantly fat and oil(orgasm)
2655 2018-10-15 20:06:11 100% EV changes everything. With 100% EV, consumer and commercial vehicles no longer use oil for fuel. Hence there is a massive reduction in demand and the US would be self sufficient, no longer dependent on stretched supply lines to unstable/unfriendly parts of the world.
2656 2018-10-15 20:06:04 You gotta make em with grapeseed oil, onions, bacon, salt & pepper bro they slap sum serious
2657 2018-10-15 20:06:01 Why do I wait 2 hours at Walmart to get an oil change when I can do one at home in 30 mins?¿?¿
2658 2018-10-15 20:05:55 Saudi trolls have been at me all day long telling me that they will cut off our oil and we will all sit in the dark.  I suggested they do something unnatural with a camel and blocked them.
2659 2018-10-15 20:05:50 Fixed it by taking the MX Ergo apart and cleaning it out. As I suspected, oil and dust accumulation blocked the sensor (and causing the contact points to stick). Was a pain to fix, but behaves like new now. Only 6 months old too.
2660 2018-10-15 20:05:48 China ia working on reducing coal - now in local jurisdiction authority. China spends more per capita than any other nation on reducing emissions. Canada is working on increasing oil/gas and creating more emissions per capita than any other nation.  We look bad.
2661 2018-10-15 20:05:38 Not a fan of jt but you clearly don't understand oil pricing
2662 2018-10-15 20:05:33 Maybe introduce the "KitKat Responsibles" range sans palm oil?

2665 2018-10-15 20:05:13 I assumed you knew what u were talking about. I’ve lived there + co pulled out bec couldn’t find enuf oil 2 make drilling viable. Checked + sadly the situation re oil, gas and natural resources hasn’t changed much. 100k barrels /day v 10m/day Saudi + 900k/day UK approx.

2670 2018-10-15 20:04:49 I used them once and my car started making all kinds of noises 1000 miles before I was due to have another oil change.  I went to my car dealer and they said my oil level was really low!  So yes, I would check it.  Never went there again!
2671 2018-10-15 20:04:44 Congrats Janab.. 

You have done alot for people of DIKHAN and they too gave respect to your services.,But being president of South KP,  @AliAminKhanPTI  it's right of people of south KP on you to raise voice for their rights, like Gase and Oil projects & Good Road to Peshawar.
2672 2018-10-15 20:04:44 If we were getting a better price for our Province's oil, I would be pretty keen to see the Olympics in Calgary, but I am concerned that we just can't afford it now.
2673 2018-10-15 20:04:33 So true :), if it had a wider distribution of TAGs, then it would fractional easily like palm oil because of chain length/saturation incompatibility and low solubility at room temperature, thus simplifying the polymorphism of the solid fraction.
2674 2018-10-15 20:04:33 Ah! What?! I’m a Republican with two autistic boys and we help cancer patients. You are so far off the map. Please! Give me a break (and you need to take Cannabis oil.)
2675 2018-10-15 20:04:27 Are you saying that oil price volatility does not contribute to economic volatility in India?
2676 2018-10-15 20:04:16 that's why it's critical to divest from oil and develop renewable energy sources 

but no

we'd rather stay under the thumb of the Saudis

2678 2018-10-15 20:04:03 Anybody know whether Saudi crude is used in the gasoline of any particular oil company?
2679 2018-10-15 20:03:51 $1000 oil coming soon to a barrel near you! Fk it, someone has to say it do i'll go first.
2680 2018-10-15 20:03:28 Blend equal parts AP flour, shortening, and vegetable oil, then brush that on your pans. Best solution I've found if you do a lot of baking, and it will keep for a while in the fridge.
2681 2018-10-15 20:03:25 Little known fact: Our oil in MN comes from Canadian Tar Sands. We'll be alright. If the Saudi's shut us down, we can make up the difference with Fracking.  #tcnt #TheMoreYouKnow.
2682 2018-10-15 20:03:20 Not the asker, but:
The German war machine needed oil. I don't know if Soviet territory was their best option, but it was a reasonable decision.
Also, waiting for a Soviet invasion would give the Soviets more time to mobilize and prepare. You don't fight when your enemy is ready.
2683 2018-10-15 20:03:13 I've been here since 1 and I want to get my oil change already LETS GOOOO

2686 2018-10-15 20:03:05 How frequently did you change the oil in the gear box? Did you simulate different temperature climates? Perhaps introduce some minor contamination into the oil?
2687 2018-10-15 20:02:49 Back in the 80's, when I was working on the Post-Natal wards, we regularly used Peanut oil to moisturize babies after we had bathed them #FoodUnwrapped @jimmysfarm
2688 2018-10-15 20:02:42 Finally got an oil change.. they washed my baby too. She’s gorgeous again! 
2689 2018-10-15 20:02:40 ... and said we're no longer going to import 75,000 barrels of their oil every single day. Just kidding. Of course we will continue importing Saudi oil, even though Canada has the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
2690 2018-10-15 20:02:35 Hasn't played a game yet so we can't say but his now former coach says he lost a bunch of weight and deserves a shot at playing. I'll take Maurice's word for it & when the Avs pick him up, and they're much deeper than the Oilers. there may be something there. There is zero risk.
2691 2018-10-15 20:02:26 There was a time pwani oil and durex were the hottest accounts in town
2692 2018-10-15 20:02:17 I guess due to the length, you need an oil slick to keep it intact. 
2693 2018-10-15 20:02:12 Seems to me that if everyone who works in the oil and gas industry went and voted for themselves they shouldn't need any advertising??

2699 2018-10-15 20:01:47 "We" regular people were never gonna get cheaper oil from the Iraq war. Companies like Halliburton, BP, and others grew immensely rich from the Iraq war and totally control oil production there now.
2700 2018-10-15 20:01:41 After a fucking long day a nice warm shower and lathering my body in coconut oil sounds just about perfect 

Hope everyone had a fantastic day 
2701 2018-10-15 20:01:39 Now during an actual full-scale war, this would be much, much higher.  But of course, that's why 100% EV doesn't change anything.  Oil is still strategically important, especially for aviation.

2706 2018-10-15 20:01:24 Amazing Comment ! We don’t need their oil !
2707 2018-10-15 20:01:24 The most powerful weapon #Saudi has is oil and its investments,I doubt Saudi will decrease the production of #oil to the world economy because it will hurt itself and I doubt that
2708 2018-10-15 20:01:22 They can sell 3rd mainland bridge to a company that collects tollfare. At current oil price, recovered assets, borrowed funds and no physical projects, they sell think of selling ASM. Hmmm
2709 2018-10-15 20:01:17 Trumps gonna be so happy, his oil will be cheap , Saudi/ trump hotels and they killed a Washington post reporter, now he can spin it for the #Cult45 and make himself, only him, a hero
2710 2018-10-15 20:01:16 The majority of the world’s oil supply shouldn’t be in the hands of one country. I say we take it and leave it up to Don to distribute it fairly.

2715 2018-10-15 20:00:49 With regard to research and development, yes, with regard to USA dependence on foreign manufacturing and industry, no. Our dependence on Saudi oil is another problem. So how do we fix it?

2726 2018-10-15 20:00:11 The prices does need the Saudis.
Some might also argue that sand oil is even more expensive
2727 2018-10-15 20:00:04 @elizalovesyou  back with the nail questions. I ran out of the nail oil I had so I've made my own as per your rec. those twisty pen things, are they reusable?

2729 2018-10-15 19:59:53 If you are outraged by leaking of Classified Information- where is your outrage that Kushner leaked Intel from the Presidential brief to MBS & Saudi Arabia for shares in Aramico Oil & a loan for his evil Bldg.- 666 5th Ave.

2732 2018-10-15 19:59:21 The difference between China and Saudi Atabia is simple we don't need what China sells.  If Obama didn't ban oil exploration in ANWAR we might not need Saudi oil.  Some geologists believe there is more oil in ANWAR than all of the middle east.

2736 2018-10-15 19:59:09 Oh by the way #KSA is not a real economy. They produce nothing, not even oil. Oil is pumped out by foreign engineers. SA is just a private real estate plot rented out by the Al Saud family. Said family are just a sloppy mob of psychopaths [Quoted:Yemeni kids Et Al ]

2744 2018-10-15 19:58:16 .@realDonaldTrump Sir, now that we know the Saudis had the nerve to lie to you, you can legally bomb them and take their oil. Cheap gas for all Americans! Everyone will love you more.

2747 2018-10-15 19:58:06 For sure you'd need gold & silver if oil prices skyrocket!
$4/gallon for gasoline was devastating in 2007. Can you imagine what the  prices would be!
Gold & silver are great inflation fighters!
2748 2018-10-15 19:58:01 It takes time for your scalp to stop overcompensating for the lack of shampoo. Also, very thoroughly washing your hair with just water from the showerhead gets rid of a surprising amount of oil. If you have trouble adjusting try pouring veeeery dilute shampoo on your head

2755 2018-10-15 19:57:43 This was a response to Trump’s harassment.  She’s not the person trying to take away NA land for oil drilling.  She’s not the one taking away voting rights for NA tribes with no street address. These are items you should be furious over - not a DNA test.
2756 2018-10-15 19:57:41 Listening to TMOATS on YT. Can I recommend you watch "Why Big Oil Conquered The World" by James Corbett on YT. BIG OIL is the driving force behind the GW movement. It's 2 hours, the second hour shows how.

But, I guess blood for oil/money is the new standard ie Trumps comments regarding Khashoggi. Would God approve?

2762 2018-10-15 19:57:22 @CTVNews @CBCNews @globalnews @ToddCTV today’s oil prices
WTI - $71.58

Canadian Crude Index - $31.70
Western Canadian Select - $ 24.59
I don’t see this anywhere in your news. Where is the outrage about discounting of CAD product?

2766 2018-10-15 19:57:08 Started taking CBD oil for inflammation. It’s very expensive. I’m also learning how to buy stock in the cannabis sector. Share advice if you have any.
2767 2018-10-15 19:57:08 Awwww sorry to hear that Richie.  Lots of stuff going around on both sides of the pond.  About 5 drops of Oil of Oregano under the tongue (ghastly stuff) for as long as you can stand and then drink something to get rid of the taste.  It really does wonders.

2777 2018-10-15 19:56:19 No. We will have to wean the country off toxic gas and onto renewables. Honestly man, you are obsessed with this. What is your problem? Answer my question from earlier - are you invested in big oil and gas?

2779 2018-10-15 19:56:10 It’s a big country. We import in the East and we export from the West. The TMP runs from Edmonton to Burnaby. The expansion twins the line to Burnaby, so oil tankers can be loaded with 650 000 barrels of toxic, flammable sludge and hauled through Metro Vancouver. Hope that helps!

2784 2018-10-15 19:55:39 Trump wants Native Land. He wants to end all treaties. Wants to drill for oil. Doesnt care abt sacred land. Trump started bullying EW. She did DNA so he would stfu. It was extremely disrespectful to NAs everytime he bullied her &called her Pocahontas.
2785 2018-10-15 19:55:38 its about time Prime Minister DressUp puts on his big boy pants and tells these guys to stuff it! We don't need their oil, the US doesn't need their oil... This is just the thing we need to terminate our reliance on foreign oil
2786 2018-10-15 19:55:36 Its ok, a suitcase full of  and extra oil as being asked by Trump will make it go away.
2787 2018-10-15 19:55:24 You missed the basic fact that American economics is highly interlinked with that of Saudi via oil priced in USD and Saudi currency hard pegged with USD.

2795 2018-10-15 19:54:53 Oil ,gas ,gold it doesn’t make a country the people make a country. Look hard at Venezuela you see them leaving their country we don’t want them. Take a hard look at America we fought and died for our country. If it’s not worth dying for it’s not worth nothing
2796 2018-10-15 19:54:48 How much is the per barrel of oil now and how much is the government saving ??
2797 2018-10-15 19:54:35 Good point about losing the eggs/cream/etc. I sometimes make a 'gelato' that just uses nut oil + nut butter/paste emulsified with xanthan gum and water, it's a much cleaner flavour
2798 2018-10-15 19:54:32 You're right to question, tho- what ARE we looking at?  The naked eye can't see if those gears are worn beyond service.  We don't know what circumstances these gears were tested- on a bench, bathed continuously in fresh oil?  This is a sad misdirection, actually......
2799 2018-10-15 19:54:30 People complain, but complains don't imply profitability (or even sales).

Laws regarding securities make crowd-funding a lot less profitable.

Venezuelan gov created their Petro cryptocurrency for oil investments, but try that in the US & securities regulations will kill you.

2801 2018-10-15 19:54:28 The 2012 rice exports for oil imports scheme was to get around sanctions. the 2018 Modi-is-a-genius version it is claimed will do the trick for the falling Rupee.
2802 2018-10-15 19:54:20 The Americans will go to Saudi Arabia. Suspect WMDs then try and take control of the oil. As per usual.
2803 2018-10-15 19:54:17 Saudi made a mistake threatening to remove the dollar peg to oil. The mighty dollar's hegemony will be protected by all means. I bet someone somewhere is updating contingency plans for:
1. Syria-type of destabilization.
2. Libya type of invasion.
3. Iraq type of occupation.
2804 2018-10-15 19:54:16 Not likely. At least 50% of arable US land would need to be under hemp to equal US oil use. Hemp appears to have about same oil yield as canola.

2812 2018-10-15 19:53:44 Personally, money’s on the fact that Trump knew and helped the Saudis cover it up to keep the contracts and oil flowing.

What an unethical administration.
2813 2018-10-15 19:53:41 @realDonaldTrump Hey Donny Boy, R U going to Kowtow to your Saudi friend's threats of raising oil prices if you bring sanctions for their murder ? . . . Aw, talk it over with the Evangelicals, they don't care about integrity.

Man City vs Man Utd could be a proxy oil war? Weird world we live in. sports investments have grown, but their shopping malls haemorrhaging money
2845 2018-10-15 19:50:20 I feel you, I think you should start a boycott against the oil companies and stop buying gas to put in your cars & flying places & just walk everywhere! Spread the movement and save our planet! 
2846 2018-10-15 19:50:17 I don't understand why people in Zimbabwe are satisfied with mediocrity...why shouldn't the people demonstrate when they are buying cooking oil @ $15 .Maybe our brains function differently,isu vamwe hatizvioni zviri normal kuti mafuta ne peturo zvoshaikwa munyika

2852 2018-10-15 19:49:48 The United States should use the #Khashoggidisappearance as an excuse to take control of the oil fields in Saudi Arabia. Carpet bomb  them.
2853 2018-10-15 19:49:47 India is the biggest concern for oil in general, I would say. If these prices (which for them now feels like $100) continue, they have huge problems moving their economy, and then there’ll be demand destruction. Unlike China, they have no real storage.
2854 2018-10-15 19:49:42 I’d rather oil and blood money being pumped into our club than them Amercians cunts draining our club.
2855 2018-10-15 19:49:37 Well, it is in fact the best course of path given India's high Dollar demand for buying oil and American sanctions against Iran restricting them from trading any dollars. Win win for both the countries

The load cycles every revolution from oil bath to initial contact w/mating gear spline, to pressure, release, ... repeat at X rpm
So, it's never like a static load which might have an ~infinite life.
2864 2018-10-15 19:48:43 Companies will abuse the fact that hard work is seen as Virtuous. As someone who has seen families fall apart due to 100+ hour work weeks in the oil field, they will take young minds and mold them in to something that can be milked for as much as they need. (cont.)

2946 2018-10-15 19:43:12 I'm not sure how a 30 second fry will work in an air fryer, since it blasts air through hot coils and I suspect it will need more than 30 seconds to get to optimum temperature (whereas you can adjust the oil beforehand).
2947 2018-10-15 19:43:08 I never tried this but my cousin had a spoon full of castor oil and she was in labour hours later. Hope it helps in anyway.

2955 2018-10-15 19:42:37 There is one question in my mind that I can't answer...
1) U.S. loves to "export democracy" in order to easily obtain others natural resources for cheap/no price.
2) Saudi folks are floating in the oil.
3) Why CIA, did destabilize Libia, Egypt, Syria, etc... but not Saudi yet?

He isn't as half assed as you are. Only an idiot like you took him seriously when he asked Russia to find Hillary's emails

2971 2018-10-15 19:41:15 Haha yeh,, hes trying to talk me into getting one for some comedy hooning about on the roads  i would rather have a C90 tho, with a nice 200cc pitbike engine in it, all tricked up with oil cooler & shiny new bits, racing tyres etc.. 
2972 2018-10-15 19:41:11 Bette, US Presidents (dems and republican) have ignored the Saudi governments atrocious human rights violations in exchange for oil, arms, cash, and influence since the 70's. Its the only bipartisan thing our leaders consistently do
2973 2018-10-15 19:41:11 10/10 adulting! Next up getting your oil changed! lol

2981 2018-10-15 19:40:28 Outrageous!  
No one needs a grinder - use your mom's scissors or your fingers.  
Latter the best option, then you can lick cannabis oil off your fingers.

(Gawd, kids today.)

2983 2018-10-15 19:40:22 In last 10 days crude price has gone diwn by 5 dollar, but stillin India oil prices increasing.
2984 2018-10-15 19:40:16 @realDonaldTrump won’t even realize how much this makes him look like a dope and the KSA has no respect for him.

As long as he gets his grubby, tiny little hands on their oil money
2985 2018-10-15 19:40:15 How much oil does Saudi Arabia have?
2986 2018-10-15 19:40:09 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
2987 2018-10-15 19:40:06 Trump won't do anything though, he's borrowed too much money from the Saudis. He's broke, he stays afloat by borrowing from Russian mobsters and Oil barons.
2988 2018-10-15 19:40:02 No need to use bad language. I never heard Rab C Nesbitt swear. Just remember though oil prices are volatile and building a future on a diminishing resource is not a good idea. You might get what you wish for, but I doubt it.
2989 2018-10-15 19:40:01 I don’t know why I would think oil companies wouldn’t want us to use less oil. I am so dumb
2990 2018-10-15 19:40:01 And, Trump's business with Saudi would fail. He LOVES his Saudi Princes. Wants to be royalty. We don't actually need their oil. Bully to bully, they can do some financial damage because @realDonaldTrump secured that for them. That power. It was there. He amplified it.
2991 2018-10-15 19:40:01 Do you cycle on and off with your use of castor oil? It’s a part of my scalp oil mix, which I use to oil my scalp 3-4x/wk and to mix in with my deep conditioners, but I always wonder if I should eliminate it occasionally to give my hair a break from the shedding JBCO can cause.
2992 2018-10-15 19:39:58 I don’t believe your statement that solar is only relevant bc of subsidies.       Same thing can be said for oil, farming etc.
2993 2018-10-15 19:39:53 Norway was the same with the exception that they also found a lot of wealth on oil in the 50's. 5/

2995 2018-10-15 19:39:42 Claire a Petition is a waste of time and thinking that May will step in is fantasy.

I say to all Greens & Green peace the way to stop Fracking & all Oil & Gas is to develop Hydrogen Projects But your support & help get funding for such projects bring about a lower cost option
2996 2018-10-15 19:39:40 Keep your promoted tweets out of my feed. Comms Director for hedge fund billionaire, who made his money in big oil.
2997 2018-10-15 19:39:38 I wish if our Government can strike a great deal by which India can get special price per oil barrel which is much lesser than International market by taking advantage of one of largest importer of oil. Diesel prices really needs very big drop to help farmers, transporters.
2998 2018-10-15 19:39:36 Love that wiew! Would love to help you oil that body
2999 2018-10-15 19:39:29 Most of the Saudi oil doesn't actually go to the US it goes to China & Japan & India. However, it does influence the prices within the US.
3000 2018-10-15 19:39:29 Have you looked into black cumin seed oil? It may help. Much love and prayers little guy.
3001 2018-10-15 19:39:20 Oh, you know the answer. And you weighed it against all that Saudi oil. Then you did what you always do, embarrassed America on Twitter.
3002 2018-10-15 19:39:14 No. Toilet brushes serve a useful purpose and sweet potatoes are good for you. So, no. Swastika, yes. Snake oil, yes. And tinfoil hats. Lots and lots of tinfoil hats.
3003 2018-10-15 19:39:08 They can get away with it because they are supported by a fear from western governments that if they condemn too much- then: no arms sales, no oil and worst of all, they might look to others to be their "friends" and that just wouldn't do!
3004 2018-10-15 19:39:07 I know about my stock exchanges and they are working fine. But isn't it true that your stock market crashed recently.
And in my country, oil price are high in order to collect taxes for the welfare of the poors. We dont collect taxs to pay our debts.
Looks like you are happy(1/2)

3008 2018-10-15 19:38:48 Leuk idee voor een crash simulatie; laat een Hindenburg vol met Standard Oil kerosine in de Eiffeltoren denderen, en pakweg acht uren later checken of die inslag invloed heeft. Niet op de Eiffeltoren, maar op het Jeugdjournaal. Niemand, maar dan ook niemand zou het pikken.
3009 2018-10-15 19:38:44 Mobiles and cars and clothes will be cheaper. Flour , cooking oil and other previously subsidized foods will increase appreciably.

3011 2018-10-15 19:38:42 Let's examine this. 
Now reason will apply? 
Where's the line? 
How does the accused act fall under 'reasonable', but oil as a weapon as unreasonable?  
Aren't we kinda already in the la, la, land of sound decision making?
As such, this is full TWT.
3012 2018-10-15 19:38:39 Ask what prophet would have done with all the wealth and oil that House of Saud is sitting on!?  How he would have spread the wealth among 1.2B Muslims in the world and expand God's domain and let them know that YES God is great! BUT, Instead you infedals have ISIS, lauxury goods
3013 2018-10-15 19:38:33 Dear Sarah-Anna! I am fine!well these past days were VERY humid, so EVERYONE suffered with bone pains.I am SO happy you practice your clarinet! Well during the week end I put again the rugs in the house,to be warmer. I heard today that the price of heating oil has gone REALLY UP!

3016 2018-10-15 19:38:16 I could care less about the oil  But I do care about Irans expansionistic tendencies. Not sure why youre so angry. This is a complex issue
3017 2018-10-15 19:38:07 Yes but there not enough food to feed our people ,how could we think of exporting it for oil
3018 2018-10-15 19:38:06 You really need to stop this abuse as I think we boyh share a dislike of Trump! If you print off $5 trillion and never spend a penny of it, then it wouldn’t be inflationary. If you spent it all on oil, then expect oil prices to jump. It all depends on what you do with the money.
3019 2018-10-15 19:38:05 Thanks.......I think:/ 
3020 2018-10-15 19:37:59 Sahab ko itna fekna aata hai angrezi Mai . Shukr hai yeh nahi bola oil ka production badao global warming Kam ho jayegi
3021 2018-10-15 19:37:54 Starting 4th November 2018, India will send rice to Iran in the exchange of crude oil. With this modern form of the old fashioned barter system, our dependence on the American dollar will be less and our Indian rupee will get a new life. Modi magic transforming India!
3022 2018-10-15 19:37:51 Oww! Have you tried clove oil?
3023 2018-10-15 19:37:44 Are the gears lubricated?  Does the oil ever need replacement? How does the system catch metal shaving?  Does it matter?  
3024 2018-10-15 19:37:44 Looks like an alliance of RU, US, AS , UAE to gang up on Iran and control the glut of global oil. Israel, too, they consider Iran the biggest threat.
The push to limit peaceful assembly in D.C. is also worrisome, as are giant tents, and Erik Prince wanting a private army.

Let them pull out, so what!!

3029 2018-10-15 19:37:34 Amen. There are SO many arrogant, rights-trampling regimes that only exist because of petroleum exports. Weaning ourselves off of the oil pump starves them of revenue and makes us more secure.

3039 2018-10-15 19:36:43 In high school I should have the opportunity to take a class called “Life” which teaches me how to: sew, change a tire/oil, do taxes, basic first aid, basic cooking, etc.

3044 2018-10-15 19:36:35 omg so he needs eye drops and my mom confused it with oil THIS IS SO FUCKING FUNNY ITS CALLED KARMA BITCH
3045 2018-10-15 19:36:31 This despite the fact that the bulk of ISIS territory was freed by US-backed forces in Iraq and Syria while Russia-backed Syrian/Iranian troops + Wagner mercenaries only took relatively minor towns such as Palmyra (twice), Mayadeen and Abu-Kemal + oil and gas fields.
3046 2018-10-15 19:36:28 @Nigel_Farage is now live  from the International Snake Oil Sales conference in Bournemouth, where he is selling more lies and generally being a divisive & duplicitous, “pound shop Oswald Mosley”.

3049 2018-10-15 19:36:21 Yes the oil is a terrible burden isn't it - we should really just give it all to you lot. Oh wait, we already do. Gonna fuck off pal?
3050 2018-10-15 19:36:16 yeah bit i believe the difference is prolife in the aspect of preserving our planet. Deregulation of oil companies in tx benefit corporations and line your pockets ted.

3062 2018-10-15 19:34:54 Last month I had my tie rods replaced on my Yukon. Pulled in today for an oil change and as they were pulling my truck around to the Loading Bay one of the tie rods snapped.luckily it happened today and not tomorrow when I'll be on the freeway most of the day.
3063 2018-10-15 19:34:50 you're supposed to be smart, if the saudi's kill a saudi citizen on saudi soil, which their embassy is,, why is it the world's business?  i understand why its wrong, but why should this be impacting g  asset mkts other than oil?  not like Kashoggi was an American or Turk
3064 2018-10-15 19:34:47 Both, copper,  gold but not huge amounts. The oil has slowed a bit. Was over 6 billion now down to 4. They also have large areas of very fertile land believe it or not.
3065 2018-10-15 19:34:44 $ 405 million oil revenue missing
3066 2018-10-15 19:34:36 Oil is important, and obv does influence US foreign policy.  But it's 1 piece of a very large puzzle.  And if it went completely away tomorrow, it's unclear how much would actually change.
3067 2018-10-15 19:34:30 Netanyahu, MbS, Big Oil and the Military Industrial Complex are all playing the Trump Royal Family and pushing the USA to war with Iran. Our criminal support of Saudi Arabia’s ethnic cleansing in Yemen must end. The American People do not want Forever War. #bluewave

3072 2018-10-15 19:34:12 What type of driving environments did it go through? Also curious about maintenance as @ElMomo_702 asked and the amount of metal and other particles in the final oil change (if there was one).

3078 2018-10-15 19:33:48 It's a great theory.  If we have bases in Oil countries, that's because of oil.  If we have bases in countries that are enemies of Oil countries, that's because of oil.
If we have bases in countries 10000 miles away from oil, that's because of Oil...
3079 2018-10-15 19:33:43 My emphasis even as the Anointing Oil is a Dominion marker, it is nothing without God who is the all time Victor that no one can defeat
3080 2018-10-15 19:33:36 That includes oil and the data is ancient. The remaining oil reserves are dependent upon large UK tax subsidies. Not much economic oil left I am afraid without our subsidies.

3083 2018-10-15 19:33:25 Here the point is some have worshipped the creation than the creator, so sometimes in the emphasis on the Anointing Oil, some have refused to offer it to God as a precious worship and thus denying themselves of their victory
3084 2018-10-15 19:33:15 The olive oil is one thing, the next desk over has a full range of condiments.
3085 2018-10-15 19:32:50 This is not the 1970s. Oil is expensive. State owned carriers are struggling except those run by oil rich states. PIA is in more than Rs360 billion of debt. We don't even have the money to fix entertainment screens of our old 777s. Comparison with ME carriers is beyond absurd.
3086 2018-10-15 19:32:50 The same could be said of the Ten Virgins. No oil at the arrival of the groom means no worship to offer
3087 2018-10-15 19:32:49 So you know how to change your oil?
3088 2018-10-15 19:32:48 I see, so for 50 years, we've been allies with the 1 country in the region with no oil, which has fought multiple wars against the countries with Oil, because we care about Oil.

How is it precious worship?
In Mark 14, the woman used the oil as a precious worship.
And because of what she did, Jesus Christ made a pronouncement upon her to declare that wherever the gospel is preached, she will be mentioned

3098 2018-10-15 19:32:07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Can't we build refineries for our gas supply and sell as well?  We need to restore what Carter destroyed. Get us off Saudi oil ?

Everything they inherited, are PPP regime trajectories. Take back you country people. Allow the PPP to take the country upwards.
3102 2018-10-15 19:31:42 I can’t. I just cannot watch this cheating snake oil salesman.

3108 2018-10-15 19:31:21 I have friends who work in oil fields in remote locations, and they chose their lifestyle and work/family balance. I moved to the other side of the world for my job. My partner is an actress and that's probably harder than anything else, we basically can never schedule a vacation
3109 2018-10-15 19:31:17 yup. and few  are on top of this. yuan is pegged  to gold as bridge off USD.. Russians sell oil ot china  for Yuan w/ Gold option embedded and gold stays in SGE this has been going on for a year now. SELL USD> BUY GOLD> BUY OIL and magically gold begins to properly track oil

3130 2018-10-15 19:29:25 We can take the Anointing Oil as a form of victorious celebration for we shall dine and  feast in the presence of our enemies even as our cup is overflowing
3131 2018-10-15 19:29:23 As an investor in coal oil and gas since the 70s, I stand by my correct description

His head is anointed with oil. Hallelujah
3137 2018-10-15 19:29:06 The Saudi's had to fold. They don't hold the oil cards they once did....not by a long shot. I suspect however that this is only step 1 in the unwinding of the attempted coverup. Best they do a proper job of unwinding because Trump won't likely be receptive to nonsense.
3138 2018-10-15 19:29:05 This is by far my favorite part of this pathetic oil painting saga.

3143 2018-10-15 19:28:44 Sounds like more executions to cover up the crime. Perfectly Saudi-like.
Why do we tolerate this regime? They are brutal when it comes to human rights. And don’t tell me oil, that’s bullsh*t.

I can’t even wait till i get home bc I’m very overdue 
3153 2018-10-15 19:27:42 Be careful. One time they forgot to put the oil plug back I after an oil change. I never went back.

3163 2018-10-15 19:27:03 'Ethical Oil' is a figment of the #AltRight / #CON imagination... -no basis in reality as is the case with most of their policy, thinking, and arguments.

3167 2018-10-15 19:26:48 Canada's housing market is not one market. Vancouver and Toronto are their own thing. Calgary's market did its usual swan dive when oil fell through the floor.  Montreal has basically been sane. I'm still convinced a lot of what's going on in Toronto is supply and demand.
3168 2018-10-15 19:26:48 I’m voting yes on 112. It’s time for us to take modern technology seriously. I don’t want oil wells by houses and in parks or wherever. And I cannot stand to see all these sell out politicians on tv who sold out to the oil companies telling me how to vote.

3173 2018-10-15 19:26:13 I think we are underestimating our huge & introduction population,  most oil producing nations like us are relatively smaller in number,  yet we manufacture next to nothing,  the Tourism industry,  manufacturing, ICT,   education,  medicine,  discoveries, nothing is going on
3174 2018-10-15 19:26:10 The Apostle John wrote “you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all have knowledge” (1st John 2:20)
Once the Holy Spirit is upon you, you can be anointed with oil for knowledge which helps you to overcome and dominate
3175 2018-10-15 19:26:07 Prostitutes charge 10k per night, which is equivalent to 300k per month & 3.6 million per year. They earn more money than Bankers and some Oil company workers.

Woooow!!!! 
3176 2018-10-15 19:25:53 Wow, what a smart tweet (not). Voters can't wait until YOU are up for reelection. Texans aren't stupid. We know you don't really listen to any of your constituents and are just the errand boy for the oil lobby and special interests. #CorruptGOP

3178 2018-10-15 19:25:48 So youvare looking to get working natural remedies for Acne and other skin problems? Teatree oil is a very popular choice for treating acne because of its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.

3179 2018-10-15 19:25:38 2. The Holy Spirit
The anointing Oil signifies the Holy Spirit
At the consecration and choosing of a person to be of service to God, the Anointing Oil is poured upon him and this can signifies the infilling of the Holy Spirit upon such a person.
3180 2018-10-15 19:25:37 As long as oil is mined in the Arab region, the Europeans and the US will stroke you and smile at you. from 2040 less oil and the EU and USA will not smile at you anymore. Poverty will prevail in the Arabian Peninsula. Now trade and not tomorrow.

3218 2018-10-15 19:23:06 Saudis threatening to increase the cost of oil if there's any  sanctions. That should be a clear-cut sign that these are not the people that we should be selling arms to. Let them get them from Russia or China or whoever because they won't be the same quality.

3229 2018-10-15 19:21:34 This is exactly the right time for all of us to start pressing for Trump to sanction the Saudis. Once they are sanctioned, they will retaliate by raising oil prices and therefore gas prices in the US. This will turn off Trump's base big time.

3240 2018-10-15 19:20:38 Hey @adamtodbrown.  Trump said about Elizabeth Warren: “She’ll destroy the country. She’ll make our country into Venezuela." Do you thinks he's referring to the state of crisis they're experiencing?  I think he's referring to the nationalised oil, because that's scarier to him.

3245 2018-10-15 19:20:11 If Saudi Arabia stop selling oil for US currency our currency going to lose 70-80% of its value so so they holding US hostage and can do whatever they want to do like Fly planes into buildings and kill Anybody  they don’t like.

3250 2018-10-15 19:20:02 They were responsible for 9/11 but they only accept dollars for oil which gives us powers almost no other country has. Being able to print trillions of dollars at will, being able to censor transactions to anyone in the “west” unless they agree with us. Etc etc.

3294 2018-10-15 19:17:49 Anointing oil is mentioned twenty times in the Bible, as in such instances where it was used in the Old Testament to anoint the high priest’s head, or used to sprinkle the temple to set it apart as holy and dedicated to the Lord.

3351 2018-10-15 19:13:47 Layers upon layers? Big Oil, Saudi pushing for USA war with Iran, Trump business ties, Netanyahu pushing for USA war with Iran, the Military Industrial Complex pushing for war everywhere. If we just walked the walk of the talk we talk this would never happen.
3352 2018-10-15 19:13:40 This was geared to the oil sector had nothing to do with pot....

3356 2018-10-15 19:13:03 USA wants to control the Venezuelan oíl.  The crisis is provoqued by a comercial and económical blocked. Also the media is controled by the US. Goverment.
3357 2018-10-15 19:12:46 I most certainly am not a Trump fan. I am fiscally conservative.
There are many tribes and the 5 civilized tribes have benefited from the Trump economy. Oil and gas has been huge for my tribe.
Don’t make ASSumptions.
3358 2018-10-15 19:12:45 I get why people like pumpkin spice but I don't remember from where i think Starbucks? Their pumpkin spice latte has this kinda film of oil or grease or something on it, and its just nasty.
3359 2018-10-15 19:12:37 so, Saudi killed - > Pompeo going - > Pompeo not happy - > Pump more oil in return?
3360 2018-10-15 19:12:37 One of many ' (12 @ oil on board ). On show at the RUA Annual Exhibition at the Ulster Museum from Friday....
3361 2018-10-15 19:12:35 Everybody talks about oil but nobody mention geopolitical strategic positions or the fact that the US buys oil from Mexico and Venezuela as well.
3362 2018-10-15 19:12:07 “Cara Mia! How would you like to entertain our guests? Hot oil or flaying them alive?”
3363 2018-10-15 19:12:04 Thank you thank you! That has so helped put my mind at rest. It's just the not knowing. If it helps you, I made a little jar of fine salt - I use epsom or himalayan - with coconut oil. I keep it cold and I poke my finger in and root around. Aids both sensitivity and desensitises.
3364 2018-10-15 19:11:56 But yeah, oil field job seeing that’s how my husband supports us  I wasn’t saying either are a good choice. Just from a different point of view.

3372 2018-10-15 19:11:31 I’m at a combo car wash/oil change place waiting for some guy to find a part and some dumbdumb left their bmw for a wash but armed the alarm so whenever the poor guy hits it with the power washer the alarm goes off. 
3373 2018-10-15 19:11:28 This is unquestionable!

We expend scarce military resources to get involved only when our national interests are directly at stake. The only natural resource of any significance in the ME is oil! 

Otherwise, why did we fight two major wars there? 
3374 2018-10-15 19:11:27 @real Donald Trump:-Mr. President, Sir ! IF  oil reaches $100 a barrel, send in the military jets ?? 777. Your servant, Anthony.
3375 2018-10-15 19:11:21 It's been a big job to score the record number of entries for the 2018 Brian Chambers award, so we're running a few days late.  But the judges have been 'burning the weekend oil', and we hope to  let the ten finalists know who they are shortly. We've seen some great research!
3376 2018-10-15 19:11:20 ทำไมการจะซื้อbio oil มันทำใจยากกว่าการจะซื้อลิปวะ ฮืออออ
3377 2018-10-15 19:11:10 #SKINJIN it is to my great regret to announce that i’m really, really liking sunday riley’s juno oil... not too sure if i’ll repurchase it at Full Price, but i do know i’ll get another bottle during the sephora vib sale
3378 2018-10-15 19:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: sad crust with chunky coconut oil and pulled pork.
3379 2018-10-15 19:11:05 Because it is the oil companies that run the countries.
3380 2018-10-15 19:11:02 Right. The entire oil industry made a net loss of $67 billion last year.
3381 2018-10-15 19:10:55 I bought the giardenera #sic from Waitrose and I have to say it could have easily fooled a non vegan. Drizzling a little olive oil and heating it a little longer than stated made for an authentic restaurant tasting pizza. Would definitely order again. A little salty but good 
3382 2018-10-15 19:10:55 A ése punto en particular hay que adelantarse. Sobre todo en tema #patentes ¿sabés lo que debe entrar tan sólo por eso en el caso del Charlotte's Oil? Un amigo paga fortunas por su hijo. Porque es legal importarlo y es el único estandarizado.
3383 2018-10-15 19:10:54 Not having a morbidly obese English football (soccer to the more western comrades) fan is like there not being an Arab country without oil to exploit.
3384 2018-10-15 19:10:52 I been thinking about air fryers because I hate having a bunch of leftover oil from regular frying that I don't know what to do with
3385 2018-10-15 19:10:47 Let's get the pipeline built which is in the national interest. World Price mid 70's and Oil were selling as low as mid 12 dollars (WCS) from our country. 60+ differential due to bottleneck. US is full of pipelines within their country. Canadians, let's build our own pipelines.
3386 2018-10-15 19:10:47 Did the Saudi royals seduce Trump completely? It must be a nail biter in Riyadh as to how trump reacts. There will be no Saudi influencing oil over $100 a barrel; there will be no Saudi alliance with Iran/Hezbollah.
3387 2018-10-15 19:10:39 I need an oil change & air in my tires & my car detailed/cleaned out 
3388 2018-10-15 19:10:39 Day three without heat... The landlady says she'll contact the oil company, but for now, we're just huddling. I've had to burn a bit of my shop stock to keep warm. ^^;
3389 2018-10-15 19:10:36 I often make seitan ”meat”balls, they have to be thoroughly sesoned before cooking, and afterwards fried in a pan with coconut oil, to get a crust and more taste :)
It takes a while to get a hang of it, but this Christmas I hope to have Swedish meatballs for the smorgasbord! ^^
3390 2018-10-15 19:10:34 Gettin my oil changed and I pull in and they say “Hey Beautiful” lol how nice 
3391 2018-10-15 19:10:34 "Oil it" is my new favourite wining chune.
3392 2018-10-15 19:10:26 Oh, that's okay then - arm sales not in danger, now can we have some more oil please
3393 2018-10-15 19:10:24 One of the secrets of the restaurant industry is that rancid deep-fry oil gives more flavour, esp. to fries.
3394 2018-10-15 19:10:17 I’m still cackling over “Semen is not holy oil” how did I miss it when @ayeshakfaines said it on set?

3400 2018-10-15 19:09:48 Unfortunately the answer is oil and they are counter to an even worse threat Iran
3401 2018-10-15 19:09:31 Opening my trombone case for the first time. I knew it would be my life. It was. I became a professional musician and teacher. I can still smell the slide oil in my memory.
3402 2018-10-15 19:09:22 Yes it does. If oil is produced in countries with lax environmental rules, they flare methane and natural gas byproducts.

If you truly want to reduce climate change, you'd support Cdn oil over foreign oil.

But based on our convo, it's more about ideology than facts or plans.
3403 2018-10-15 19:09:22 And remember proper butter is a tasty substitute for oil when frying.
3404 2018-10-15 19:09:15 They should seek asylum in a county that doesn't need  Saudi oil and tell their story on who ordered the hit....
3405 2018-10-15 19:09:10 The fucked themselves they should have gone with the NEP in the 80's...shot themselves in the foot.  You con and your pure BS.  Harper did nothing for 11 yrs to get oil to tide and neither did the Con for 40 yrs in Alberta.  Bunch of hypocrites!!!!
3406 2018-10-15 19:09:06 Cooking oil kkk
3407 2018-10-15 19:09:03 Yes it was a lucky day for them when they pitched their tents on oil and even luckier when America drove Britain France and Israel out of the oil fields.

3422 2018-10-15 19:07:19 I’ve heard that they never go away but they do fade to just the white marks. I heard putting coconut oil and then Siran wrapping your stomach helps because of the heat. So I’m gonna try that!
3423 2018-10-15 19:07:09 Get one! With grilled chicken! And oil and vinegar dressing!
3424 2018-10-15 19:07:08 The Saudi royal family knows exactly what type of person POTUS is. This is why, when threatened w/sanctions @ Kashoggi, the Saudi prince threatened raising oil price to $200.00 per barrel. It was then POTUS mentioned "rogue killers".

Trump's only love is for money.

3437 2018-10-15 19:06:22 Big oil in the US loves funding these activists to oppose our pipelines.  Anything to keep their supply cheap.   Anyone who thinks any of these activists are actually concerned about the environment is delusional.  It's all about the $$$
3438 2018-10-15 19:06:19 Why do people like you believe adopting renewable, clean energy would be too expensive? Were cars over horses too expensive? Industrial production? New energy sources create jobs just like oil and coal. If you’re afraid of a changing economy, get off the fucking internet.
3439 2018-10-15 19:06:18 Basically cooking oil is our country's number 1 commodity.

3459 2018-10-15 19:04:41 Totally agree with ur comments about us needing a real energy policy. But even w r dependence on fossil fuels, we wld still be able to buy Saudi oil even if we cut ties with them bc oil is sold on an int’l market now. We don’t buy directly from SA.

3474 2018-10-15 19:03:47 My main worry is that if our civilization collapses and humanity survives but reverts to a pre-industrial state: we will die on this rock.

All the easy coal/oil has been extracted. Even if knowledge of nuclear/alt power survives, we won’t be able to take advantage of it.

3477 2018-10-15 19:03:38 I’ve been trying to get a handle on chia’s decision making process. I’m at the point where always the easy decision is eschewed in favour of a 1:10 000 chance long shot, like Hall for Larsson, it the Koskinen deal, Russell term, Lucic term etc. If he was a stock analyst...
3478 2018-10-15 19:03:38 What's bad is we make no attempt to reduce our dependence on oil. . Most of our imported oil is guzzled by freight vehicles. 
Rail transport is about 3 to 5 times more energy efficient than road transport. And this energy can come from sources cheaper than oil.
3479 2018-10-15 19:03:36 My great grandmother was native but this was a verboten topic even though she was still alive and I remember her. My grandfather had more than " high cheekbones," so the idea of her DNA being removed more than mine, being a topic is not believable.

3486 2018-10-15 19:02:50 Very true !the Saudi’s are getting 10% of the profits from oil extraction . Everything else goes to us corporations
3487 2018-10-15 19:02:48 Trump gets Deadhead-style love because of scarcity. Trumpers are whale oil fanatics in electric age, they know they’re not getting the whaling boats back.

3496 2018-10-15 19:01:28 You can't threaten the American people like you can out corrupt politicians.  Your days of dictating to us are over. The higher oil prices go the more Americans oil will be brought to market. So you, Russia, Iran, Venezuela better acquire a taste for oil cause you can drink it.

3498 2018-10-15 19:01:26 You would think so, but that ignores how the boom/bust cycles have distorted the cost equations. Oil patch in a boom pays ridiculous wages, pushing costs way out of whack.
3499 2018-10-15 19:01:21 Rant: @jiffylube you’re signature service is either a joke or the location I went to is ripping us off. My grasp was you not only changed the oil but check and fill washer fluid Etc. A day after my appt my washer fluid is empty. Did you change my oil or should I check that too?
3500 2018-10-15 19:01:10 Could be...or, not. It is easier to be contrarian in Sweden (and many European countries) because there isn’t so much internal dissent—more of a monolithic culture. But, we’ll disagree on the impact of oil.

3508 2018-10-15 19:00:44 My grandma is straight up roasting me right now. “You got some oil for your hair...looks terrible. Hehehhe”
3509 2018-10-15 19:00:35 My concern is that we willy nilly use plastic for spurious reasons. Crude oil is spilt in our oceans to create polythene bags for you to cushion a lemon! Which I’m going to squeeze anyway! I’m the customer, the customer is always right. At least give us the option to not have it!

3525 2018-10-15 18:59:26 Look, there are plenty of sound reasons why oil producing countries usually want to be paid in US dollars and not in Chinese yuan, and it's not because of some "deal" Kissinger did with the Saudis in the 1970s.

3528 2018-10-15 18:59:21 This is, of course, the right thing to do, but you are late to the party. "Increasingly difficult"? The American public has known since 9/11 that Saudi Arabia is no trusted ally of the US. $$$$$$$ SA = largest importer of American arms. SA = 2nd largest exporter of oil to US.
3529 2018-10-15 18:59:15 time for caffeine round 2 - but is it still early enough for coffee, or should I switch to the brominated vegetable oil?
3530 2018-10-15 18:59:14 Back in 1978 the left wing loons had us in gas lines sighting that the US was running out of oil and gas. We must change our lives. 41 yrs later this is more oil and gas to the point that production is deliberately stopped to increase price.

3534 2018-10-15 18:58:53 Dropped my car off an hour half ago for an oil change and it hasn’t moved from the parking spot I dropped it off at.

3550 2018-10-15 18:57:24 I was being fair, 300 grams of sugar is only 1200kcal, he can fill the rest of his calories with whatever he wants.

Olive oil based diets are perfectly possible, GLUT1 deficient epileptics on the ketogenic diet do it without any adverse effects. Not even comparable to be honest.

3555 2018-10-15 18:57:14 I'm pretty sure it's been done and tossed in a drawer with all of the other viable alternatives that oil companies buy up and keep off the market. They show scientists in ads working on such things to appease us

3561 2018-10-15 18:56:55 if you know it then he knows it for sure.  The problem is the 100 billion arm deal & the possibility of an oil cut.
3562 2018-10-15 18:56:54 India has a structural problem with energy security (oil). It consumes a whole lot to grow its economy, but produces little

3564 2018-10-15 18:56:41 have you tried a face wash called panoxyl? it’s supposed to be extremely strong and clear acne. It really helped me awhile ago but it is VERY drying. another thing to try would be skin oil for moisturizing and maybe a more natural soap like African black soap or charcoal soap !!

3573 2018-10-15 18:56:04 About time these producers of oil got heavy penalties for their role in polluting the environment. At the start OK, but once it was known, back date all monetary fines to then. Money to go towards off setting their carbon footprint.
3574 2018-10-15 18:56:02 Not an argument for TMX or any expansion of oil production. Your focus on oil markets completely misses the point of needing to reduce oil consumption in order to deal with #climatechange. Saying if we don't sell to other markets others will is not a valid argument.

3577 2018-10-15 18:55:52 Saudi Arabia is main reason why oil doesn't reach 200 or more. You think Exxon, etc. Will miss an opportunity to increase their profits? How could small business or working survive? No one want to see that happen certainly not me. However, the anarchs might enjoy it

3585 2018-10-15 18:55:19 Why this look like an oil painting
3586 2018-10-15 18:55:11 The problem is that they will cut oil supplies. It's very tricky situation.

3588 2018-10-15 18:55:08 If smne is starving they can even drink oil, but variety makes people choosy. Nevertheless salty water never quenches thirst.
3589 2018-10-15 18:55:08 they should stop using soybean oil in everything. I would rather have less but all olive oil than have it mixed w soybean oil

3591 2018-10-15 18:54:46 Is CBD oil the new kale?
3592 2018-10-15 18:54:45 That's just the tip of the iceberg. Gas is $1.12 there, $1.24 here. Elec. 6.8 there 14.3 (over double) here. Last time I checked, heating w nat. gas was 1/2 our furnace oil cost. I'm betting booze is cheaper too. Homes are about the only thing more expensive there. #peipoli

3603 2018-10-15 18:53:57 Without the spirit of God and his power, the Anointing Oil is just another olive oil or such as of its kind
3604 2018-10-15 18:53:46 Its ridiculous. The part about shunning her mother likely not true. IF her mothers family knew and given the attitude at the time, they would not have mentioned it and nobody could tell. I have personal experience here, that makes me doubt that part of story
3605 2018-10-15 18:53:42 Cannot get the taste of clove oil outta my mouth 
3606 2018-10-15 18:53:39 あと…以前はジクサーで高速道路を走行していても感動するくらい安定していた事も勘案すると、最近（走行距離12000㎞）の高速走行での挙動不審は明らかにフロントサスペンションフォークOILの劣化が原因だと思います。
3607 2018-10-15 18:53:38 But international prize of oil still remains at 81 dollars per barrel since Las MO th and the rand actually strengthened again the dollar? So whats the reason behind
3608 2018-10-15 18:53:37 My neighbours had the same issue, some of the village has gas some don't, however they were paying three times as much as us per year for just their oil compared to our lecy and gas, might save in the long run.. #Smartnetworking

3610 2018-10-15 18:53:28 What is the Anointing Oil?
Anointing with oil is a symbol of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and is used in dedications and blessings.
3611 2018-10-15 18:53:26 Who will benefit from a schism btwn S.Arabia & the US concerning #JamalKhashoogi murder?

The OPEC

The US hv been battling to reduce global oil price by forcing MBS to increase production.

With tough sanctions by Trump, oil prices will skyrocket.

Trump will look the other way
3612 2018-10-15 18:53:26 Still need Saudi? That's debatable. From an investment point of view and environment point of view, it is good for oil to go sky high. People will find ways to reduce oil consumption due to high prices. Oil investments will make lots of money. So where's the negative?
3613 2018-10-15 18:53:16 Bad news: do not know what is wrong with my car since a certain oil changing place revved the engine up afterwards. And now my car won’t idle. 
Good news: my OB/GYN place just sent me a refund check because I paid too much! Go fig!
Better news: live-streaming DBD in 5 minutes. 
3614 2018-10-15 18:53:02 You are ill informed about what Socialism is.
It's not everybody gets free stuff simply because they're breathing.
It's getting our tax dollars to work for our benefit...not give aways as tax cuts to the rich, or subsidizing oil spill cleanups or Wall Street bail outs.
3615 2018-10-15 18:52:56 Saudi leaders now use oil money to intimidate US wow what a nice world.
3616 2018-10-15 18:52:51 I just got offered a job as a rigger on an oil rig in Bristol! Fully confident my #toonboom rigging abilities will see me through this exciting new venture!!! #rigginglikeaboss #newheights
3617 2018-10-15 18:52:50 @milesSI are you watching the England game tonight or burning the midnight oil? Or both haha! Can’t wait for fm! Looks brilliant again this year!! 
3618 2018-10-15 18:52:50 The sooner the Saudis run out of oil the better
3619 2018-10-15 18:52:45 Cassandras of Global Warming are saying the Earth will be gone by 2030. Just like in the 60s when they said overpopulation will destroy us in a few decades. Just like those who said in the 70s we’ll run out if oil by 1990. That reminds me I need gas for my Acura.#climatechange

3625 2018-10-15 18:52:24 You realize that every need we have is met with industry and oil and gas. Transporting the meat. Packaging the meat. Baggies, pens, containers, etc etc all requires oil and gas. This shit gets burned into our atmosphere every day by billions of people. Yeah. Lets talk about meat
3626 2018-10-15 18:52:22 The only thing I know about my oil is that the dashboard currently says it is at 80%.
3627 2018-10-15 18:52:15 Oil shortage.

OPEC slowed down oil shipments.
3628 2018-10-15 18:52:08 That is why the release of this machine has not begun.

Extraction of shale oil causes terrible damage to the environment. The United States produces shale oil the most in the world. In Russia shale oil production is prohibited.

3636 2018-10-15 18:51:39 just an fyi - after using PharmaCannis' Goji OG vape more and trying the ATF cart, I've upped final rating for goji from 3.5 to 4outof5. Within context of lab formulated terp profiles type, they r excellent carts. sum will disagree. Vapes r hard 2 review b/c of diff oil types.

3638 2018-10-15 18:51:23 I get that.  The point is that price spikes create more production which lowers the price - spikes are temporary in the current market.  "The best antidote for high oil prices is high oil prices."

3640 2018-10-15 18:51:18 I take fish oil supp too. They only smell (and taste awful) if I bite them and they brake. Otherwise the shell keeps them odourless. One might be broken inside your pack. Or maybe try another brand. But yeah supplements aren’t meant to smell of anything
3641 2018-10-15 18:51:16 We should be much more worried about whether or not the Saudis will keep buying our bonds instead of whether or not they will keep selling us oil.
3642 2018-10-15 18:51:13 3 in one oil at the ready... I like your style.
3643 2018-10-15 18:51:12 Why do these men at auto shops always have nasty ass attitudes?? U wanna do an oil change or nah?? And don’t give me a got damned list of made up shit wrong with my car either

3645 2018-10-15 18:50:56 Saudi has been a strategic partner to the US for decades. They fund religious extremist while "helping" us combat it. Bush Clinton Obama Trump all kiss this Saudi ass because oil.

3693 2018-10-15 18:47:17 This article really speaks to the generosity of Canadians. Our mission to empower the US economy by giving them cheap oil is moving ahead as expected. Now we must punish the carbon criminals within our boarders that wish to use fossil fuels to run businesses and heat homes.

3695 2018-10-15 18:47:11 You are lying as always. The reason is the approximation of the date in the beginning of US imposed sentences with Iran. With that, Iran will not sell its oil and Saudi Arabia will not take care of the demand.

3706 2018-10-15 18:46:38 Of course we still need gas, lots more. And will do for a long time. And the rest of the world too. Onshore wind (not cheap) would make no difference, and the Swansea tidal project less difference still at huge cost. Why even mention them? Neither of them could replace gas or oil
3707 2018-10-15 18:46:28 Sir would you address this: the low wage earners I know in everyday life are disillusioned.
All tariffs are higher. Gas oil.electricity soon. Rupee getting lower
How will they reap benefit of naya Pakistan. Will they be able to feed their families still as they did before?
3708 2018-10-15 18:46:20 No, the point is the Irish Border has been a problem since it existed.  The Single Market was oil on the waters, and the EU - and people in NI, but apparently not Leavers in England - have always understood how important it is.

3723 2018-10-15 18:45:30 We don’t have oil so we will have to suffer from the Global market.
3724 2018-10-15 18:45:23 Like all great barristers, even Simon may be wrong on occasion. Lucky for us no harm to the economy, no needless oil & gas ban & petrol didn’t increase by 20 cents a litre.
3725 2018-10-15 18:45:22 It’s not weapons that ties us to Saudi; it’s oil. As long as they’re pumping 5-7mbd and using only 0.5mbd they are the top-up station of choice for US (importing 8mbd) and us (importing 1mbd). We’re over an oil barrel.  #c4news
3726 2018-10-15 18:45:18 I have the oil, bought a new bottle the other day
3727 2018-10-15 18:45:10 personnellement je n'ai aucune illusions, ni sur l'issue,ni sur notre capacité à changer (vu le chantier).Je fais mon job, et je me prépare pour la suite
3728 2018-10-15 18:45:01 With our new oil fields and gas something makes me think they will anything they can make money on!
3729 2018-10-15 18:44:59 I've been on the Atlantic Ocean and seen dead whales and turtles plowed over by oil tanker ships
And now Saudis threaten to Jack up gas prices
Thank God Trump saw the benefits of being self sufficient and not needing them to survive

3736 2018-10-15 18:44:22 I know. After a disastrous summer, I have just about recovered financially but the boiler is a gamble. Do I pay someone to look at it and give me a quote, so I know the size of the problem? Or ignore it, and waste the 1/3 tank of oil I have? #smartnetworking
3737 2018-10-15 18:44:21 For years of theft and robbery of Scotland's oil water and land for the contempt on us with Brexit and much worse your assault on the most vulnerable and poorest Scotland is a warm hearted country we don't like to see people punished homeless & starving kids so #Dissolvetheunion

3740 2018-10-15 18:44:13 Stubbs: Liberal failure on pipeline has cost tens of thousands of jobs. Canadian oil sells for $52 a barrel less than the US.

Sohi: The reason you had such a hard time building pipelines when you were in government was our non-stop politicization of the issue.

3741 2018-10-15 18:44:04 You appear to be blissfully unaware that the oil revenues you deride were used to pay for Thatcher's deindustrialisation of Scotland. She even stopped Ravenscraig being saved out of nothing but spite. Half Scottish? Which half? The half that takes whatever Westminster give us?

3761 2018-10-15 18:42:38 Washed my hair with Palmolive shampoo and applied argan oil and olive oil afterwards. It feels heavenly 
3762 2018-10-15 18:42:37 Higher oil--> higher trandportationcosts--> higher COGS --> higher prices ---> inflation---> $GLD
3763 2018-10-15 18:42:36 The U.S. is extremely limited in what it can do to Saudi Arabia. In 1973 KSA agreed to accept ONLY Dollars for its oil. That fact has made the U.S. Dollar the World Standard Reserve currency and has made the U.S. the richest empire on Earth and has funded our military dominance.
3764 2018-10-15 18:42:31 Fascinating idea! Win/win/win for oil companies/regulators/environmentalists. Wonder if anyone in WV is using their “free” natural gas tap to mine. Albeit the tap is probably regulated by the gas company.

3781 2018-10-15 18:41:09 that was a bad ass graphic on bloomberg, we know carbon emissions are definitely doing harm, the oil WILL run out, until alternatives are created (solar charged electirc cars, alternate fuel sources that dont harm environment etc) there isnt shit we can do about it...
3782 2018-10-15 18:41:07 Getting an oil change and a new set of tires for Cap (that would be the name of my car). Reading while I wait, but there's some sort of "news" channel on the TV in here and it's making my brain hurt.

3788 2018-10-15 18:40:32 Comrade Cheeto  Caligula is in a pickle. If he confronts his pals in Saudi Arabia they throw wrench in oil prices and investing in him. If not his corruption is tied to this horrible incident. Your move Traitor.
3789 2018-10-15 18:40:32 I think that would be fine. It's not like they didn't know what Saudi Arabia was like going in. They wanted the oil money.
3790 2018-10-15 18:40:28 Yes, she thought that then, for a few reasons, one of which is that if we made all of our own oil and gas, it would ween us off from reliance on the middle east, which is why Obama was onboard initially. Natural gas is better than diesel for use as fuel too, a stop-gap.

3814 2018-10-15 18:39:01 Estimated worth. Take into account the fact that peak oil has been widely regarded as being hit with Ghawar & Safaniya fields that valuation won't last long. Couple that with a movement away from carbon fuels another drop. But the main thing to take into account is theyre thugs.
3815 2018-10-15 18:38:57 Thanksgiving is next month. I’m praying for a That’s So Raven moment so I can see my deep fried turkey glistening after I take it out of the oil.
3816 2018-10-15 18:38:54 Off to cook ceps a la Bordelaise but with charbonniers instead of ceps. And possibly butter instead of some of the olive oil.
3817 2018-10-15 18:38:42 Saudi Arabia is the most powerful country at the moment, they can control nearly the whole world with oil and other shit they have.

3830 2018-10-15 18:37:47 I think this is a little bit optimistic. Basing it on oil price, how are they going to get workers who left to go home, back to their own country. Thanks to home office status

3842 2018-10-15 18:36:31 Yeah, I'm not sure these folks are the ones that need a lesson in economics dude... Charge all you want for it. VOLUME is what matters. Strategic oil reserves, fracking, and a very real push to drop fossil fuels entirely for the good of the planet all add up to decreased demand.

3868 2018-10-15 18:34:44 I was hoping you’d see this. So, CBD oil is safe after all? And yes, I did coddle her, I’d never seen her like this before and it was so pathetic, the panting, foaming, and trembling. I’ll try the distraction. Are there any recommendations for dosing? (She’s 30lbs.)
3869 2018-10-15 18:34:43 Like a place where reg people can go to change their oil. They got everything jiffy lube has. You just do it yourself. It’s not cheaper though
3870 2018-10-15 18:34:40 Hypocracy. And KSA sends workers back to Pakistan. And future economic deals collapse. And oil supply becomes an issue. Your kind will blow horns about FO messing up a reasonably good relationship. Jackals!
3871 2018-10-15 18:34:34 It's not him though, it's outside forces such as the world economy, stronger dollar, expensive crude oil and the Zuma corruption.

3878 2018-10-15 18:34:14 Oil supply is going to increase whether you or I like it because the developing world wants a taste of what the West has had for a century. 

And if Canadian oil cannot reach international markets, places like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela will supply it instead.

3966 2018-10-15 18:27:21 What's your point? Canada has no voice in this. We import oil from Saudi Arabia because of stuck up Easterners (like you?) who won't accept Alberta oil.
3967 2018-10-15 18:27:11 ...but became #10,000 (4x) in 2015, you'll understand that d current #16,000 is far better.

But that's not even d end o! Prices will start reducing as we start refining our oil in Nig, grow our own rice under PMB.

We only control supply"!

3978 2018-10-15 18:26:23 I do not want to talk much about this subject, but remember the oil crisis of 1973, along with the collapse of the stock market (1973-1974) the biggest loser was America, not Saudi Arabia

3981 2018-10-15 18:25:50 CBD oil until she chills again? also, make sure you're not "coddling" her when she's scared. find something she likes (fetch?) and distract her if you can so the attention she's getting doesn't focus on her being scared. if that makes sense.
3982 2018-10-15 18:25:49 Saudi has right to deal and treat with its oil at any way its want. But what about CNN what they lie and support anything against Saudi such as what happened in Turkey. They did not wait till the investigations finish. They just repeated what others say.

3993 2018-10-15 18:24:51 It's official. John Oliver is just a sleazy snake oil salesman whose been put there to fool the retarded "lefty" Democrats and SJW's who don't know how the real world works. It's a disappointment.
3994 2018-10-15 18:24:47 A little info ma’am: 1) oil revenue reduced cos oil prices were slashed in half prior to its recent surge 2) the value added of our agric output is a better metric to look at. What is it? With cash crops, it’s not great. 3) let’s look at the data again now that oil prices are up
3995 2018-10-15 18:24:45 Imo canola oil should never be used. Olive oil or gtfo (coconut and avocado oil are acceptable)
3996 2018-10-15 18:24:44 few drops of coconut oil. some people say they use lime. No chemicals that will end up polluting air, water, soil..
3997 2018-10-15 18:24:38 And you vote for big Oil every time. Lying Ted, who wouldn't defend his own wife or father. Great morals.
3998 2018-10-15 18:24:29 I think that trying to stop climate change is a mistake and violates our prime directive which is to mine the oil and restore a more GAIA friendly climate.  The earth's life form will successfully live on after our job is done and we are gone.
3999 2018-10-15 18:24:29 That's a huge oversimplification.  We're also deeply involved with S&N Korea, with Ukraine, Israel, etc... All countries with no oil.
It's absolutely true that Oil makes Iran/Iraq/SA more important, but it's not anywhere close to 100% of reason US is involved.

I'm sick of this "law-abiding gun owners" red herring in all its iterations.
4004 2018-10-15 18:23:55 @kuchendame I saw your article from a few years ago about chili oil. I found if you heat the oil and then put it into a bowl filled with crushed peppers you're less likely to burn the peppers.

Just an observation.
4005 2018-10-15 18:23:54 Oil needs to stay in the ground. And I won’t stand foul language with you, so take your own advice.

4010 2018-10-15 18:23:36 You’re probably right. My mum used half lard, half butter both for Eccles & Chorley cakes. Make great pastry. Rapeseed & palm oil margarine on the other hand, do not.

4016 2018-10-15 18:22:57 The deal will be, more oil, lower oil prizes against no proofs for murder.
Human rights don't matter to @realDonaldTrump  neither they do to the Saudis.

4022 2018-10-15 18:22:41 You can always paint oil over acrylic, but not the other way around. Just be aware that if there is a lot of acrylic build up it may flake over time which would affect the oil painting on top.

4024 2018-10-15 18:22:38 When Saudi threatens to turn the oil tap off, you know they are rattled! "We know he's ok!" So where is he then? Oh no idea! Err, how can you be sure he's ok then? & If he's ok, why the threats?
For a kingdom that is happy to chop off body parts, I doubt a killing is no problem!

4082 2018-10-15 18:18:30 I think Harari is correct too. KSA does a lot to help Lebanon and Jordan.  It is moderate on Isrl-Palestine. It doesn't seek spikes in oil prices that would induce a global (and non-OPEC MidEast) recession. 

KSA does a lot of stuff I don't like, but it's a pro-status quo power.

4097 2018-10-15 18:17:12 $BTC is a commodity - insider trading applies to securities trading activity.  The SEC would not investigate a spike in oil prices that occurred hours before an OPEC announcement.
4098 2018-10-15 18:17:10 @maddow  i am worried of gas prices during winter times. Arabian world would raise the oil gallins to $100-200.  Imigration laws are still separating families, insurance co will lack pre existing conditions. Disastrous foreign tariffs and future economic resección will star soon.
4099 2018-10-15 18:17:09 To the British Unionists in NI my advice if you want to stay in the  British Union you better discover oil in Lough Neagh and PDQ.
You are now just a hindrance to a Little England’s Brexit wet dream, don’t say you weren’t warned about your London chums.

4114 2018-10-15 18:15:54 100k in additional carbon tax per well and a $50 differential between Mexican Maya / WTI isn’t a sustainable plan with no transport infrastructure or refining capacity.

4140 2018-10-15 18:13:42 right, so Trump doesn't see a gold mine in carbon taxes?  why doesn't he play the game then.  Big Oil, that's why.  And when oil moves on this, as some have and others will, only then will the countries that rely on it move to for their benefit.

4158 2018-10-15 18:12:27 . Real socialism is to nationalize our oil, coal, energy, water,

4182 2018-10-15 18:10:31 RECENT wars definitely were about oil. It's the primary reason we even care about stability in the middle east. And if you think protecting oil doesn't have a major influence on our foreign policy you have been living under a rock.

4222 2018-10-15 18:07:43 One of the things I really like about oil painting is the complete disbound from the illusion of control, I know what I want to paint I make a sketch but the painting itself morphs during the process, it is a dialog.
4223 2018-10-15 18:07:43 The only reason why this is true in any way is because Saudi Arabia is aligned with Israel and the USA. Why? Because of Oil and money and power and fear of IRAN. All at the expense I may point out of YEMEN children. Quit making them the moral high ground.
4224 2018-10-15 18:07:36 On the flip side, this is the first season I'm getting to go to a Colts game in Lucas Oil!
4225 2018-10-15 18:07:29 If we are so worried about the Saudis raising oil prices, why can’t we ask our world leading heavily government subsidized Oul Companies to keep our rates down?

4228 2018-10-15 18:07:22 If one egg  spoils it affects others, if one  touches oil the remaining gets soiled with oil so tell me what do u expect Paul Pogba is the bad egg  in Man U as a top top club he should go !!!!! His talent is based on hair salon  @omodia4real @RadioPaparazi @Sean_RMW
4229 2018-10-15 18:07:18 But I am still in favor of finding alternative energy. We can't be dependent on oil forever. Plus having different forms would allow for competition between energy companies.
4230 2018-10-15 18:07:12 It’s really sad but I guess that’s the price to pay for it.

4233 2018-10-15 18:06:46 Trump has taken the party so far to the right they are nearly off the map. The democrats have moved a little to the left. Real socialism is to nationalize our oil, coal, energy, water, Banks. All we are saying we need universal health care, a bit more money spent on education,
4234 2018-10-15 18:06:42 Money talks, killers walk.

4236 2018-10-15 18:06:24 It's like you've never heard of WWI/WWII/Korea/Vietnam - all wars fought in places very far from major oil fields.
I suggest to you that while Oil is a consideration in war, it's not the primary one, and whether we go 100% EV or not will have little impact on US foreign policy

4239 2018-10-15 18:06:14 I suppose if Scotland had oil that could be an example of giving a natural resource away.
4240 2018-10-15 18:06:05 Ok big deal. Your 20%. What about the other 80. Listen go live among your friends and leave American taxpayers alone. Why not try working for the money you get. Instead of taking bribes and payoffs from big pharmacy, oil and gas industry.

4243 2018-10-15 18:06:00 Compare them to the Berlin observations or any of the observations you would make in the field today (oil & gas, environmental testing, etc.). The Keeling Curve is rather unique in measuring atmospheric concentrations.

I'm overweight, 54, & full of osteoarthritis (constant pain). I take man made anti-inflammatories, but no pain killers. I don't smoke or drink. I'm beginning to experiment with 0 THC CBD oil. My goal is better mobility, some pain relief, & a better night's sleep.
4248 2018-10-15 18:05:44 The saudis threaten that a shortage of oil from their production would send world economies into a down turn ? What about America now being a oil exporter ? INTEREST FREE LOANS FOR SOLAR TO HOMES STARTS THE CONVERSION TO NEW ECONOMY
4249 2018-10-15 18:05:43 #US policy toward #Moscow today strangely ressembles #Reagan’s policy in the 80’s: high #military budgets, pressure on #oil revenue, interdiction on exports of technology, be it #DualUse IT or #oil and #gas related.

4292 2018-10-15 18:02:40 Why NNPC mega fueling stations in Abuja changed to Dan oil?
4293 2018-10-15 18:02:39 Saudi’s threaten to raise oil prices if we do anything about the murder of a journalist. Imagine if we had spent the last 20 years dedicating Apollo level resources to developing alternatives to fossil fuels. Voting for stupid politicians locked in the past hurts our security.
4294 2018-10-15 18:02:38 "Climate scientists have a political agenda" the man says while looking the other way while an oil producing country murders a journalist in a foreign embassy.

4299 2018-10-15 18:02:16 Why do methane emissions continue to rise at the same rate even when the oil industry slows? When you see a stack flaring than yes there is methane leaks but the well gets serviced and cleaned and shut in stopping leaks.
4300 2018-10-15 18:02:14 It is estimated that approximately 11.7% (198,622bpd) of the current oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut-in. It is also estimated that approximately 6.6 percent of the natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut-in.

4325 2018-10-15 18:00:11 He should also visit a certain supermarket along robert mugabe rd that has 2 different prices for locally produced cooking oil and take selfies with the staff there while they explain to him their reasons why.
4326 2018-10-15 18:00:11 Those parents were offered snake oil. Quacks have always existed & will continue to exist for as long as seemingly educated people are willing to play along

And if what you said were true, few girls would be born in the future. Remember the mass graves? 500K dead girls in India?
4327 2018-10-15 18:00:07 This is one of my fave quick, easy dinners. Prawns marinated in sambal oelek, a touch of soy, sesame seeds, sesame oil, mirin, bit of sugar or maple syrup. Pineapple chunks. Char the pineapple chunks until they’re brown and golden (add a tiny bit of oil)

4341 2018-10-15 17:58:47 Forests, that absorb carbon, are now a net source. IF you factor in *insert literal bullshit*
We should honestly just stop using oil for fuel and instead use all the hot air spewing out of you instead

4344 2018-10-15 17:58:31 Prove that alternative energy sources are not better than oil.  
Showing that countries that are not capitalist are part of the carbon imprint is showing that pollution is a world problem that goes beyond capitalism. Of course humans are part of the carbon imprint.

4349 2018-10-15 17:58:11 I still cannot believe how the Republicans just ignored his moronic comment! Then again, they start all these wars for oil but they are not the ones doing all the dying in them and becoming disabled fighting in them. Cowards!

4359 2018-10-15 17:57:40 not only does mr @auwudrick not mention oil. He doesn't mention LNG or banks
4360 2018-10-15 17:57:39 Demand for oil is elastic in the long term. Go ahead and make threats, clean technology will just evolve and get implemented faster.
4361 2018-10-15 17:57:07 “Right now, the Canadian oil patch is getting killed by the differential, which is enormous. But over time that’s going to change because there’s going to be some pipelines coming up. So if you survive this short-term pain, THE LONG-TERM GAIN IS VERY BIG” $IPCO

4366 2018-10-15 17:56:46 Flash forward to the Gulf War. If Saddam had tried a little harder he probably could have rolled through most of Saudi Arabia before we got Desert Shield rolling. So now we are protecting the Kingdom with military bases in order to guarantee stability/oil in the region /4

4369 2018-10-15 17:56:36 Saudi oil is a powerful weapon. But using it has big risks
4370 2018-10-15 17:56:22 I’ve heard about using pumpkin in place of oil but never tried it. Thanks for the directions!
4371 2018-10-15 17:56:17 why worry about ground water, man made earth quakes, and climate change when oil exports can be exceeded?

4392 2018-10-15 17:55:10 Tempting, but we didn't need to be so apocalyptic to end Wahhabist terrorism, just efficiently take out its leading sponsors, as well as its foot soldiers. The sponsors remain untouched, as our "elites" make billions selling their oil, selling them toys, managing their $.
4393 2018-10-15 17:55:06 bhai sab oil ka khel hai !!! they can get away with anything jb tk US ki support hai
4394 2018-10-15 17:55:03 One thing I like Kachikwu is that he is both professional and truthful. APC see Nigeria like some personal house to do as they wish. See how they are holding claim to oil?! A national treasure! Thank for telling us Nigeria still pay fuel subsidies.
4395 2018-10-15 17:55:03 Well then we better start using our own damn oil
4396 2018-10-15 17:55:01 On the topic of using military facilities as a transport hub for coal/gas/oil, I have no problem with it if the facilities used are no longer in active use. For actively in use facilities, I have a huge problem, as those facilities are better used for defense purposes.

4398 2018-10-15 17:54:46 We are so happy to hear that! It is an incredible oil!
4399 2018-10-15 17:54:44 They had no problem putting sanctions on Iran, 3rd largest oil producer. Not to mention, Saudi Arabia is more dependant on US for protection and investments. Name me one Chinese or Russian colony that had economic success. Toothless threats.

4413 2018-10-15 17:53:57 And why are these wars faught? Largely bc of natural resources ie OIL. Therefore by helping move the world to sustainable energy and giving countries energy independence it would reduce the need / cost for war.

4415 2018-10-15 17:53:43 Possibly because the same people also want gas and oil.
4416 2018-10-15 17:53:37 fixing climate change makes our economy better not worse. @marcorubio is beholden to Big Oil at the expense of all Americans. Rubio is therefore a Traitor. EV's reduce energy needs 84% vs ICE. EV's result in great ROI by dumping ICE, better national security, cleaner air and more

Bring it on because no matter how rich they are they will still be in our shadow 
4419 2018-10-15 17:53:25 See, people used to care about nature too. Just mining uranium was destructive.

Society is build on cars. The big Oil companies used the Big Money to hire scientists to lie about effects of fossil fuels.

4431 2018-10-15 17:52:40 You make it sound like we can make oil go away in a day.  We are talking about taking serious steps, which are already happening, to protect our planet. Medicine and technology have make life better.  Why can't environmentalists work to protect our planet?
4432 2018-10-15 17:52:35 hi angels. cook some mushrooms in a pan with onions garlic and thyme. put that on pesto toast. parmesan on top. drizzle with honey and truffle oil. you deserve it 
4433 2018-10-15 17:52:30 right because...the oil is gonna run out. as I was saying. 
Also, as more economies shift to renewables, the value of the oil reserves drops. because as goes demand, so goes the price.

4455 2018-10-15 17:51:24 Absolutely. Interrupting military cooperation (giving Yemen a break) would be an eye opener too. Let MBS fend for himself taking of his toys away. And never mind oil.

4459 2018-10-15 17:51:08 Maybe a long tail if oil prices are the only driver. As EV replace ICE vehicles oil demand will drop. So prices will drop. Need to turn off supply as well. But high oil prices might induce more supply.
4460 2018-10-15 17:51:05 It is longer than 45 years. Knight-Ritter investigated the so-called oil stoppage in 1973. It never happened. The Saudis kept shipping oil.
4461 2018-10-15 17:51:04 It started when Chavez nationalised the oil industry when he implemented the archaic socialist doctrine

US DOLLAR.

4483 2018-10-15 17:49:25 Totally ridiculous of Riyadh to let the GM of a news organization draw up what pretty much was a foreign policy retaliation plan. Guy understands nothing about the oil market. Just thinks people will buy no matter the price. No going back from EV.

4488 2018-10-15 17:48:58 That's the thing, we DONT boycott them. In fact both Dems and Reps support them. We only boycott the places like Venezuela because we're mad that they nationalized their oil and screwed over ExxonMobil.

4493 2018-10-15 17:48:34 Prosperity for a few early speculators only. The energy return on fracking makes it not worth the energy spent in the process. Fracking drowning in debt in states - looks too big to fail but the bubble can only burst.  I wonder why big oil is not doing this? Arms length.

4514 2018-10-15 17:47:09 "The United States’ relationship with the Saudis has always been somewhat of a delicate balance, weighing economic considerations such as oil, and currently arms sales, with the kingdom’s record on human rights abuses"
4515 2018-10-15 17:47:07 He's stating KSA needs $90 oil to pay "bills": housing subsidies, healthcare, edu, social welfare programs, infrastructure builds, economic transitioning, etc. That is all built 'on top' a 'production cost' of apx $10/brl oil.  They have 2 pay a lot of ple 2b 'content'/not revolt
4516 2018-10-15 17:47:06 So GE’s wind business won’t be enough? Shame, because their giant new turbine just needs 4mph to get started. Equivalent to discovering a new massive oil reserve. Except it’s inexhaustible, of course.
4517 2018-10-15 17:47:02 - The oil tank on the front
is an interesting design.
Cooling fins on it
could be added in an
artistic way, I think.
I like it though.
  
4518 2018-10-15 17:46:44 IMO is a fine alternative while we work on more renewable resources. Must be better than tankers of gas and oil travelling 1,000’s of miles importing it!
4519 2018-10-15 17:46:43 Add equal Parts olive oil and butter in a pan, heat on medium, add spices( Start with tsp), stir in cubed chicken/potato/peas. Let cook until chicken has browned, stir often. Add 1 to 3 cups broth, let simmer until potatoes are tender. Add more spice to taste.
4520 2018-10-15 17:46:42 Texas is abundant in untapped potential. Jobs created: ppl to excavate, drill, well service & refine. These jobs branch out to other jobs:  landscapers, haul trucks, water trucks. When oil booms so do hotels, food, home loans & auto loans. Etc...

4522 2018-10-15 17:46:36 It’s amazing what painkillers and cannabis oil (taken separately so I don’t slip into an unconscious state) can do for my ability to live a normal life despite being unwell again today. I honestly don’t feel a thing and it’s wonderful!

4574 2018-10-15 17:42:44 ‘The rest of my gun oil’, oh, you mean that 0.0002 ml left in the bottle? 

To be fair, though, this is gun oil we’re talking about, so I opened the bottle, slipped on the singular drop and didn’t stop sliding until I was most of the way to London.
4575 2018-10-15 17:42:33 Let's get the pipeline built so we can export our oil.  It's in our national interest.

USAC---Compression for NG going nuts.
4672 2018-10-15 17:35:01 If it’s turbo charged, watch your oil level very closely.  When they start burning oil, it can start very fast.  Also, it the clutch slips at all don’t wait to get it changed to help avoid having to change the flywheel.  Good luck.

4677 2018-10-15 17:34:37 I don’t disagree. But it’s a very complicated situation over there. If we were to support Iran then we would anger Israel.  I look at it like this.

4718 2018-10-15 17:31:43 Stir all three into yoghurt with cayenne, ginger, garlic & salt. Marinate chicken in this for a few hours. Then remove the chicken and sauté in hot oil until toasty-looking. Add the marinade to the pot, cover & let simmer until the oil separates from the sauce. Yum, we promise.
4719 2018-10-15 17:31:36 I’m sure but he obviously doesn’t want to act on it! America is now almost self reliant on fuel! With the fuel that Canada can supply they don’t need Saudi’s oil as they use to. So why is Trump holding back!

4733 2018-10-15 17:30:46 The US has reached its goal of becoming a net exporter of energy, largely in part due to fracking.

Here in Colorado, fracking provides 150,000 good paying jobs.

Without fracking, the US would be beholden to oil strongmen like Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro.

4736 2018-10-15 17:30:39 Driving electric every day to work... I guess the downside would be higher costs for goods, but beyond that, $200 barrel oil would be great to convince others to switch to electric or at least plug in hybrids.
4737 2018-10-15 17:30:38 That's a good thing, Fracking has been used only as a geopolitical strategy to not depend from opep oil.

The horrific killing are somehow on videos somebody somewhere has it. When there is oil underneath, then its not their responsibility
4744 2018-10-15 17:30:17 Fine, but I'd rather they put their money in US startups than Saudi oil fields. Although I suppose they're ultimately doing both.

4763 2018-10-15 17:29:13 The Saudis helped with 9/11, bomb innocents (with our help), kill our journalists.  Why do we cuddle up to MBS?  It has to be more than oil - they have to “know where the bodies are buried” for many US atrocities.

If the price of oil did shoot up to $200 a barrel, that would be absolutely crippling for the U.S. economy.

4966 2018-10-15 17:15:23 With fracking, US is almost energy independent. Only about 5% of U.S. oil is from Saudi, and can be replaced.  If Kingdom turns off the taps, it will have no money for prostitutes, drugs, terrorists and to pay all its citizens to sit around watching TV

4973 2018-10-15 17:15:01 We need to make sure that our weapons are not being used to kill innocent people in Yemen. We are providing assistance to the Saudi government for them to use planes and bombs so oil can leave the port by Aden with ease. Then oil can be shipped more readily to US. Bad deal!

Air crew falling from plane,trichi passengers were stranded for more than 24 hrs.
Same case for almost all.
4982 2018-10-15 17:14:40 Not so extraordinary...I think it's pretty clear he's financially backed by the Saudis in some way or another, and knows not to go against them or be cut off. 

He's a con man, a snake oil salesman. I think the NYT investigative article into his finances makes that pretty clear

4985 2018-10-15 17:14:26 True, to a point.  But we still couldn't replace Saudi oil if they get pissed off and use their oil as a retaliatory weapon.  Dispite your point any interruption in world oil supply will result in higher prices at the pump.
4986 2018-10-15 17:14:24 Yet more proof that energy independence is a foreign policy and national security issue of paramount importance. The less we need to rely on Saudi Arabian oil, the more ethical our policies can become.

Support American energy and renewables!
4987 2018-10-15 17:14:23 TD: #FX:  We remain moderately bullish on #SEK & #NOK, particularly with respect to #euro. Within this, we continue to see differentiation. With #Norges operating from a position of relative strength & bolstered by high oil prices, we expect NOK to outperform SEK in weeks ahead.
4988 2018-10-15 17:14:20 the deal put in place 85 years ago is fraying at the seams- the US and Saudis were always very different in structure and beliefs. Oil may be the lifeblood of the world economy but the US is the only global power that can protect the Saudis. The Saudis have lost most US support

4998 2018-10-15 17:13:40 We are not talking about US oil embargo !
We are talking about abounding the Old Petrodollar. Selling oil with foreign currency other than the dollar or any other commodity, and what that would do to world economy.
It is huge impact !!!

5072 2018-10-15 17:10:12 Hold on, just a darn minute...The Saudi folks are going to raise oil prices and we'll be paying double for a gallon of gas, because we are concerned about a reporter that stuck his nose where it didn't belong?

5081 2018-10-15 17:09:54 I disagree with you. Are Buhari's policies also affecting other countries struggling with fall in global oil price which directly result into drop in Fx. Some are currently in second recession and huge devaluation.

5085 2018-10-15 17:09:50 That’s beautiful.  And very sweet.  But native Americans get a heavy percentage of profits from their oil and casinos and someone pretending without proof to be a Native American to reap their benefits aren’t welcome.  And rightly so.

5139 2018-10-15 17:05:47 Did you know that regular maintenance like oil changes can help keep you safe while you drive? The maintenance will make sure that your car is running well, and give your mechanics a chance to check belts, hoses, and other parts for wear.

Climate change and man’s contribution to it was not something that was dreamed up to anger Republicans and hurt oil sales.
5161 2018-10-15 17:04:20 Climate change fixes GREAT:
A) Fund EV rebate with $1.50/gal gas tax
B) buy EV - get $20,000 cash rebate 
C) 150MM cars become EV. rebate cost $3T
D) saves $250B/yr at $70/barrel oil. EV's 84% more efficient. $20/ton CO2

5199 2018-10-15 17:01:54 How do they pay their debts? They’re billionaires; they pay their debt down little by little just like almost every other person or business on earth. If you want an oil tycoon to own United that’s fine. I’m just pointing out the glaring hypocrisy.
5200 2018-10-15 17:01:52 So the Saudis kill one guy and we want to let the Russians and Chinese take over their war machine, Sanction their oil and drive our economy into the ground—allowing Dems to claim the Trump economy is a sham. But let’s not sanction Iran, which does this sort of thing daily.
5201 2018-10-15 17:01:49 He's in the pockets along with the whole US government of Saudi Arabia. He will defend them, by making excuses. It's all about the oil for us.

5205 2018-10-15 17:01:42 Expensive oil is good for the West and bad for the Saudis. As it will spur innovation into oil alternatives, domestic oil production, and sending western month to other oil producers.

5217 2018-10-15 17:00:56 He is right about scientists having political agendas and that's the problem. As much as they complain about Big Oil sponsoring studies and them being slanted-Big Gov is even worse. TRY to get funding for refuting humans causing climate change
5218 2018-10-15 17:00:54 and of course the pipeline delivers oil that gets BURNED
5219 2018-10-15 17:00:47 There are a lot more US jobs dependent consuming oil than those that are dependent on producing oil. If prices spike its bad for the US economy overall even if its not bad for the oil patch.

5226 2018-10-15 17:00:35 thank you for sharing that. it's true that when you are poisoned, things that normally are relatively benign or even healthy can be problematic. i try to load up on fish oil since the microwaves oxidize fatty acids causing dry skin.

5234 2018-10-15 17:00:05 Oil and gas money. 
5235 2018-10-15 17:00:01 Every day we see more instances of oil pipelines leaking or exploding, while a barely controlled fracking industry continues to contaminate our drinking water.
5236 2018-10-15 16:59:59 They also want to prevent SAUDI ARAMCO from entering the stock market as it is anchored with oil reserves and valued at 2 trillion dollars. 
5237 2018-10-15 16:59:59 Don’t sell Saudi weapons. Don’t buy Saudi oil. 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudis. Not to be trusted.
5238 2018-10-15 16:59:58 Olive oil &amp; Mustard oil are the better ones, when it comes to cooking oil.
5239 2018-10-15 16:59:56 A lot of us do care, but our governments prefer to ignore it in their relentless persuit of money and oil. I, for one, wrote to our foreign secretary to tell him not to sell any more arms to the Saudis, but he went ahead with his deal. Disgusting.
5240 2018-10-15 16:59:47 Yeah honestly it freaked me out a little bit when I saw what had just been crawling on my neck.  LOL  My house is now a toxic waste land of Bug Poison and scented Lavender candles/incense/scented oil/and sprays.
5241 2018-10-15 16:59:44 The truth is these are critical times, not everyone will sell his dignity to protect this shameful indefensible act, there's a reputation to protect outside tenure.

5266 2018-10-15 16:57:45 NATO is concerned for the protection of #Norway and its oil reserves. A vital resource for Europe and a likely target if war ever broke out.
5267 2018-10-15 16:57:38 No excuse for 45 AT ALL but I’ve been screeching about this since Daniel Pearl was murdered, and found out that the Saudis beheaded 137 people that same year. Until Americans are willing not to be so oil reliant, we are in a relationship with a nation we shouldn’t be in. Period.
5268 2018-10-15 16:57:38 Salman is not a US prisoner he is the king of Saudi Arabia which is one of the most powerful countries worldwide. If he decides to cut oil supply your whole country will stop and your president would ride a bicycle to the Whitehouse so have some decency when you talk to a king
5269 2018-10-15 16:57:36 Except you left out the part about the price of oil going up. Good thing Obama reduced our dependence.
5270 2018-10-15 16:57:36 Natural hair products range from $9-$25. Need shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, treatments, leave in, cream, oil, gel. Not to mention scarf, bonnet, shower caps, brushes, combs.

5274 2018-10-15 16:57:21 Less than 5% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia.  How will they threaten us economically? Maybe flood the market and reduce prices? #BeSerious
5275 2018-10-15 16:57:20 When the petrol industry boast how they have made the American medical monopoly what it is today in it 4 the profit not the cure, it's time to wake up and realize how much $ big oil makes subverting the true science of cannabis and how the Arabs bought laws to target the infidels
5276 2018-10-15 16:57:18 Nigeria export Sugarcane and import Sugar, export crude oil and import fuel, export timber and import wood.

5277 2018-10-15 16:57:13 God no.. You really don't want to combat the oil tanker traffic on highway 85 in North Dakota. It would take some back tracking in SD, but I'd take the Interstate into Montana.. Hit the badlands and Teddy Roosevelt state park. and then go towards Billings.

5285 2018-10-15 16:56:46 Outside the US, there are huge consumption subsidies.  These have the net effect of making oil/gas MORE EXPENSIVE in the US, since consumption in these other countries is much higher than it would be absent subsidies!
5286 2018-10-15 16:56:45 You mean oil right? Cause the Saudi Arabian government is driving those prices up right now. Maybe we shouldn't rely on oil anymore and invest in something else.

5289 2018-10-15 16:56:25 How do they pay their debts off then? They don’t have the capital to do it. Who the fuck do you want to own the club? We have to have an owner and I’d rather it be some rich oil tycoon then some red neck Americans leeching money off United commercial pull

5298 2018-10-15 16:56:12 About 80% of d federal budget is recurrent. It was a struggle to pay salaries. Recall that from 2014, Jonathan was already borrowing to pay salaries, despite earning over $400 billion crude oil. Where did all d money go? Buhari inherited a nasty situation that had to be managed.

Save until right before she dipped in her first skewer: I had used peanut oil.
5308 2018-10-15 16:55:10 Is the USD dollar $ based off oil or just freedom at this point
5309 2018-10-15 16:55:10 I get what you mean, but you aren't taking into account all of the hundreds of other positive medical effects that cannabis oil has on the body.

5318 2018-10-15 16:54:44 We as supporters of Congress party which is party of intellectual are happy that parties like BSP are not coming along in 2019. Most of these parties are silent on Rafale, Oil Prices, Unemployment, GST, Demon.etc but ridicuously they all need max seats in the alliance
5319 2018-10-15 16:54:40 Oh I agree with legalization and it's benefits!  100% on board with that.  Just don't discount the benefits of the pipeline. Discount like our oil revenue! haha

5326 2018-10-15 16:54:03 and in which currency will these Iranian neighbours will buy oil from Iran?
5327 2018-10-15 16:53:57 Yes CBD oil has stopped me beating myself up in my head about every little thing I say or do. It has also helped with my nausea.
5328 2018-10-15 16:53:48 Focusing on Canada would mean curbing demand growth, until we reverse that oil supply will grow. If we don't meet it Russia, Iran, Iraq, USA, Venzuela, Brazil and Mexico will. I'm less confident that those countries will care about emissions (at least politically in US case).
5329 2018-10-15 16:53:42 Conserve oil and gas and the US wouldn't need to buy it from anyone. This is 'sheer' reality.

5341 2018-10-15 16:52:52 Canada represents ~15% of our petroleum supply due primarily to a lack of pipeline access in the Northeast and easy shipping from one company, Irving Oil.  This in no way represents a threat to our economy or sovereignty.

5343 2018-10-15 16:52:46 it just say coconut oil .. it just comes in a jar
5344 2018-10-15 16:52:45 Saudi Arabia's threat to use oil as weapon to silence criticism over journalist Khashoggi murder is outrageous. Just because it is sitting atop oil wells should not prevent the world from questioning the mysterious disappearance of Khashoggi in its consulate in Istanbul.
5345 2018-10-15 16:52:43 I have had good success w/ @andydhorowitz "The BP Oil Spill and the End of Empire, Louisiana" and I believe Andy has oral histories online that compliment the article! I think it would be a good fit.
5346 2018-10-15 16:52:42 In 2015 the national reserve was $29 billion, ECA $2 billion, oil price about $35. This nation depends on imports of everything to survive, including petrol which we should be producing. With little revenue, it was inevitable that the nation would go into recession. It did.
5347 2018-10-15 16:52:41 Maybe swap them out for chickpeas done in chili oil instead?

5349 2018-10-15 16:52:29 saudi increasing oil prices will crash the economy, which is literally his entire political platform.
5350 2018-10-15 16:52:22 Apparently, from what I just saw in the National 
Post we sell our oil to China so cheaply compared to other countries we may as well give it away; nothing in Canada politically and economically ever makes sense.

5352 2018-10-15 16:52:11 Stop ranching, prioritize hemp as a renewable resource, cotton and lumber and oil are destroying the earth. The time for change is now. The time for doing is now. The past doesnt matter all that metters is were here and we need to do better

5359 2018-10-15 16:51:56 Trump saying not ending Saudi arms deal is for US workers is part of his big-lie-bought-by-people who would see right through it if Dem prez said it.

It is not.

5361 2018-10-15 16:51:52 No it isn't. Stop using terms you don't understand what they mean. You can be against modern day slavery and also acknowledge that Sweden would literally go bankrupt without oil. 

Manchester City is funding entertainment with the same money. Not the same.
5362 2018-10-15 16:51:45 you take money from oil companies and you voted to drill the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.    Bold, huh?
5363 2018-10-15 16:51:41 Well in the west where I work in the oil and gas industry, the Liberal government has been devastating to our industry as well as investment in our industry.  Interestingly enough, it’s hard not to notice that most equalization payments come from these same provinces
5364 2018-10-15 16:51:41 Did you once mention that you took sleeping pills? If so, don't. Learn TM and drink warm golden milk. ( almond milk infused w/ turmeric, anise, honey, black pepper, coconut oil, cinnamon etc..) before bed time.  Speak to a therapist.

5368 2018-10-15 16:51:33 Wow. This could be big. I want 2500 foot setbacks in LA. I want the city council to discuss this. Instead we just gets threats about suing the oil companies while still allowing oil wells to continue to operate near schools and homes. #environmentaljustice

5383 2018-10-15 16:50:23 well...oil gave the world an incredible productivity boost...so oil added lots more value than its USD price...
5384 2018-10-15 16:50:21 I don't drive :) 
I also despise the oil industry.

Sad to hear you feel sorry for yourself. Maybe try therapy?

5415 2018-10-15 16:49:24 At least the oil will last more than your life will last Without it
5416 2018-10-15 16:49:22 It should burn slower than normal oil but maybe it differs with cars. But they make synthetic oil from coal and blend it 50/50

5428 2018-10-15 16:48:17 Govt is not reducing oil prices when crude oil prices are down. The fair petrol & diesel price should be around Rs 50 per litre.
5429 2018-10-15 16:48:12 Um, no. The US Taxpayers will not pay the costs of exporting “private” gas and oil. Let the “private market” pay their own way. Assholes.

5435 2018-10-15 16:47:40 Get with it people. Oil has no future worth pursuing.
5436 2018-10-15 16:47:40 Disn't say they are. 

It's my answer to you people using comparisons that aren't in any way related. How is Sweden using oil in any way opposed to thinking football clubs shouldn't be funded by oil money? One is necessary, the other is a choice to ignore human rights violations.

5446 2018-10-15 16:46:56 I got my oil changed finally
5447 2018-10-15 16:46:53 lets burn the midnight oil for the sake of this lab report 
5448 2018-10-15 16:46:49 It comes from those little holes in the wall, duh!
5449 2018-10-15 16:46:45 Flight instructor: *checks the oil on the plane*

5450 2018-10-15 16:46:45 Good! The shriller the better!
5451 2018-10-15 16:46:44 I really went all the way to Hollywood to get an oil change when I live less than 2 min away from a Honda

5453 2018-10-15 16:46:32 Dear world, just because you call olive oil “EVOO”, doesn’t make it a seasoning or condiment. This world is in free fall.
5454 2018-10-15 16:46:27 I mean. I remember these. The only thing I hated from them was all the oil seeped to the bottom.
5455 2018-10-15 16:46:23 King Salman:  Dude, I can always cancel the big plane order. And, two words....The Oil.  Go with my suggestion of rouge killers. Ok?

5457 2018-10-15 16:46:14 The United States still aims to cut #Iran's #oil sales to zero and does not expect restored oil sanctions against #Tehran to have a negative impact on a market that is well-supplied and balanced, a senior U.S. official said on Monday.
5458 2018-10-15 16:46:13 I see.. I'm not on the ball with these things but last I checked the price of crude oil peaked last month only
5459 2018-10-15 16:46:12 It's balancing one-time delay vs long-term speed/quality improvement. Kinda like an oil change... never a good time to do it, but should really do it.
5460 2018-10-15 16:46:11 The wind is howling, sinuses hurt, it must be Santa Ana season. Wonder if CBD oil will help.....
5461 2018-10-15 16:46:02 Hahahaahah Saudi Arabia form 3 years ago, they didn’t depending on the oil hahahaah maybe u don’t know anything, just write what ur silly mind says hahahahaha 
5462 2018-10-15 16:45:58 Venezuelan economy hit by oil shock , an American boycott, constant CIA attempts to undermine their economy, assassination attempts from CIA and they are still there.
5463 2018-10-15 16:45:57 Is it too late to reign in the oil and gas drilling industry? A: we need our state dept of natural resources to focus on conservation #OHGovDebate
5464 2018-10-15 16:45:53 It's more unfortunate when your hopes of foreign reserves boost rests solely on crude oil prices, no strong  improvement in non-oil sector, no production of goods and services for export, no refineries, we need to learn from Venezuela.
5465 2018-10-15 16:45:52 Whose wages are going up? Mine has done nothing but go down over the last 4 years. I’m a tradesman in the oil sands. It’s public knowledge. So take the wages up BS and shove it up your ass.

5471 2018-10-15 16:45:17 Human Rights vs economic interests, Saudi Arabia is the one of the US's key trading partners in the Middle East, largest source of imported oil and Saudi Arabia is the US’ largest foreign military sales customer, with nearly $100 billion in active Foreign Military Sales cases...

I doubt they will increase the price of crude $100 per barrel, because retaliation against the US is only a threat as a result of Trumps idiocy.

Just love the country this way, once!
5486 2018-10-15 16:44:42 I get a lot of friend requests from guys that work at the oil rigs... the universe is trying to tell me something

5542 2018-10-15 16:41:59 It’s odd for you since you have no idea about oil, which is expected by the way since you’re Canadian.
5543 2018-10-15 16:41:58 Oil in general is pretty bad and as a nation Sweden has been cutting down on their usage of it in general for years. But no, it's not significantly better. Oil is just unfortunately still a necessary evil and we don't have any of our own. False equivalency.
5544 2018-10-15 16:41:58 It's already fucked up so go ahead and hurt your economy. It's not like Saudi is the ONLY country with oil. Maybe we can switch to renewable energy sources forcefully without Saudi oil companies trying to control the economy.
5545 2018-10-15 16:41:54 Agree. My Family had been season ticket holders for 10+ years... in the dome and then came over to Lucas Oil.

Price increase on tickets WOW

It just wasn't the same..

And we dropped our tickets after Curtis Painter became the QB when Manning was out.

5554 2018-10-15 16:41:34 Point being is that 9/75 of 8 trillion + perception of spending can create that demand-pull. Still, more direct impact is the rise in the price of oil that is also felt worlwide.

5625 2018-10-15 16:38:05 I think the key point here is the difference between the oil content of whole-plant foods (e.g., olive oil from olives, nut oils from nuts) vs vegetable oil out of a bottle, used for frying or in baked products.

5630 2018-10-15 16:37:49 Well you may want to know the only reason are $ is worth anything is because we are Saudi Arabias personal military.

5678 2018-10-15 16:35:15 Arre but so true. I’m having a heat induced attack today and I swear to god, until an hour back, I was holed up in a dark room, axe oil and no noise.

5682 2018-10-15 16:34:58 Are we saying that 2017 subsidy payments was only N144bn? Because if so, it compares well with the trillions in subsidy claims we were hearing circa 2012? We must question the sudden jump in 2018 though. Oil price? Exchange rates? Greater NNPC import shares?
5683 2018-10-15 16:34:57 Is the price of crude oil going up every month? Is the rand getting considerably weaker every month? I'm struggling to see why there is a petrol price increase every month. 
5684 2018-10-15 16:34:53 Glazers won't sell United anytime soon (why would they), but imagine if that Saudi Arabia Prince will take over... success is sorted at least until all the oil is sucked out from the Earth

5694 2018-10-15 16:34:22 Milk doesn’t need any more differentiation than do atta or mustard oil. I trust them to follow the same line - pure, Indian, desi cow. Milk is more about availability. More so than other commodities. It’s more a logistics and supply issue.

5696 2018-10-15 16:34:08 All it has to do is cut down pumping oil and the price sky rockets.  Trump has been begging them for months to increase (which they have a little). Only extra supply would be Iran (which is sanctioned).
5697 2018-10-15 16:34:03 In Japan, vegetable oil is called "salad oil". However, olive oil and rapeseed oil are not called salad oil. Probably "salad oil" is made by mixing some oils.

5711 2018-10-15 16:33:16 Funny that the Tea Party, which supposedly led to our current President, made a big deal about oil drilling domestically to reduce energy dependence on Saudi Arabia, a talking point that mysteriously has no role in the otherwise Juche rhetoric of this administration.

5713 2018-10-15 16:33:12 Well, one is that the repo market didn't yet exist to the extent it does. Two is that corporations weren't as global as they were so UST wasn't as vital. Three is it did sort of offset. The oil weapon didn't really "work."

5755 2018-10-15 16:30:56 Its a special tax applied to oil so the country benefits from oil and not just the oil shipping companies. But everything is expensive in Norway and wages are good. Everyone wants to work in Norway.

5808 2018-10-15 16:28:03 Totally, this should be factored into any "analyst" rating. Nowadays there are so many deciding factors ignored. E.g. massive $OIL subsidies for ICE cars and infrastructure. Unpriced economy cost for environmental damage and health damage. We live like we don't need nature.

5819 2018-10-15 16:27:04 If the Price of oil goes up, they will get more USD receipts which, in turn, will mean they need to buy more USD assets. So whatever inflationary effect the price of oil has, will be offset by more demand for USD debt demand. EMs will suffer most.
5820 2018-10-15 16:27:04 Last I was aware fracking had produced a surplus here in the United States where we became for the 1st time a major exporter of oil. Go ahead and raise it you'll destroy your own economy.

5866 2018-10-15 16:24:26 One thing for sure-$200 oil even for a short while would give Wall Street the chance to bail out every currently bad credit (and equity) bet on domestic fracking. Plenty of rich people would benefit.

Number employed in coal, oil and gas generation in US (2017): 187,000.    

You do the math, cheetah.    @realDonaldTrump #climate

5929 2018-10-15 16:20:54 I guess trump seeks to d ruination! Saudi Arabia could prevent oil . That can creates a new problem in d world specially for us
5930 2018-10-15 16:20:54 Oil or no oil, how the fuccckkk does it matter? They have talented players and manager to win them trophies in the present... while the other clubs still live in their glorious past.
5931 2018-10-15 16:20:52 This question was not raised when big private players were allowed into the oil & gas sector. Business journos debating in such a communist manner is alarming to say the least.
5932 2018-10-15 16:20:36 US reliance on oil is an issue today.  Tomorrow?  Who knows.

5934 2018-10-15 16:20:26 Reduce our dependency on crude oil. Explore affordable  renewable energy home technology which we can export & reduce import bill of energy sector.
5935 2018-10-15 16:20:16 I totally disagree with you that @fkeyamo is a smart guy. He’s a sellout and Judas of Warri. Fulanis are exploring oil at his forefathers farmland, herdsmen killing his people, because Buhari is paying him chicken change to denial his people. Very shameful
5936 2018-10-15 16:20:13 #IndiaEnergyForum when India take big step on direction of ethanol capacity expansion.

5951 2018-10-15 16:19:22 A racist is is a racist, period.  If the oil money didn’t drain towards Trump tomorrow, he would impose a travel ban on Saudis in a NY second.
5952 2018-10-15 16:19:20 Because they have their thumbs on the oil production , & the Trump empire is under the loan debts with the Saudis financially. 

If Trump, or Congress kills the $110 bill weapon sale , they will go to Russia , and kiss goodbye SA $$$$ loans to Kusher boy.
5953 2018-10-15 16:19:20 ok.. and then what happens if the Saudis decide to retaliate by no longer selling oil in US dollars.. but in Russian and Chinese currency instead.. oh and btw they want their trillions in debt back from the US too.. then what?

5965 2018-10-15 16:18:47 Don't let the threat of $200 oil bother you, JASTA gave you the authority to seize the oil fields,  and who is going to stop you? The UN? Not a chance. You can solve a 1000 year old problem and the UN knows it.
5966 2018-10-15 16:18:34 Cruz reliance on oil money assures Texans of a polluted coast line, roads collapsing from water and oil trucks due to fracking, polluted air, future mass shootings due to lack of background checks. Great legacy to our children and grandchildren.

5972 2018-10-15 16:18:19 Well ethical oil is oil that, when burned, does not emit carbon dioxide. And evidently, to the brain trust we have lots of it. #who_knew
5973 2018-10-15 16:18:16 Shades of 1973, all over again.  Are Saudi's aiming to get OPEC to support a huge cut in Oil Exports; so, whole World suffers?
5974 2018-10-15 16:18:13 @realDonaldTrump Do you know that your threat to OPEC Countries Iran & Saudi Arabia will effect many S. Asian countries economy.This is not fare, You have resolve solution by dialog to both OPEC countries.Otherwise Oil prices will be too hike & effect many countries. Be patient
5975 2018-10-15 16:18:08 Donald Trump is right, they were rogue killers if by rogue he meant ordered there by King Salman. Saudi Arabia is one of the more heinous human rights abuser but everyone ignores it because you know...oil.

6004 2018-10-15 16:16:19 Global currency devaluation after end of Bretton Woods agreement, not embargo, main reason for "shock." OPEC's gripe that oil held unfairly low US. End of US control + Arab-Israeli War an excuse to let oil float to true value. War & embargo ended in Mar but price did not go down.

6013 2018-10-15 16:15:57 Right! Because Canada is the real issue here! I feel like it’s the twilight zone. We should not be dependent on potential enemies for OIL!!!! How many of the 911 terrorist were from Saudi Arabia? We’re giving them the ammunition/equipment for their next attack!
6014 2018-10-15 16:15:56 Asking the same exact question over and over is called "holding him accountable". You don't work in our field, so you don't understand sh-t. You should probably go clock back into your job a jiffy lube and change some oil for the company. Earn that pay check.

6055 2018-10-15 16:13:13 Hey Don, are you supporting Trump’s allegation that the Journalist was killed by rogue assassins in Turkey?  Will you help him whitewash this terrible event?  Are oil prices that precious?  You are, by admission, his firewall.
6056 2018-10-15 16:13:09 I'm sure Ms. Warren knew that trump wouldn't pay the $1 million to a charity.  It was a good red meat line at his snake oil meetings but he's a dead beat, cheat, thief who never pays his bills or keeps his commitment.  She knew, we knew.

Increase oil sands production at the same time cut emissions? What kind of voodoo math is that?
6075 2018-10-15 16:12:27 Yes if most of world would reset thier energy useable sources for Renewables & Solar would greatly ROCK Saudi Arabia and the multi international business of WAR PROFITEERING, this would mean peace on earth for much of our world if our society don't need oil or gas to function :)

6079 2018-10-15 16:12:19 Your Albertan counterpart @RachelNotley has the right idea. Optimize supply chain, sign mutually beneficial agreements for FN groups, become a global supplier, and decrease demand locally through a carbon tax. Let's consume less in , not consume the same amount of OPEC's oil.

6092 2018-10-15 16:11:31 The IPE person in me really wants to see Saudi try to deploy the "oil weapon." It would a great clarification for what the economic system really looks like today and get people's heads out of the 1970s. Also, would be a valuable lesson for "China" treasury bugs.

6133 2018-10-15 16:09:46 While understand where you are coming from, the same amount of oil will get consumed whether or not there is a pipeline. This will just come from more damaging sources (OPEC)... OR it will be shipped by rail to the refinery. Both are environmentally worse options than a pipeline

6160 2018-10-15 16:08:14 becAuse land is used to get oil effectively ,(rice to oil) it's bound to cause artificial famine .This also rhe reason we don't promote bio fuels.

6162 2018-10-15 16:08:09 1) NJ had less distance to go to Europe 2) NJ has yet to play a road game since returning 3) Edm won't play first home game until Thur. NJ got home 11 days before oil. Days away and Km travelled matter. Everyone knew this schedule was going to make things very hard at the start.

6164 2018-10-15 16:08:07 A very predictable outcome. Trump's not the first POTUS to ignore Saudi transgressions. It's all about the Benjamin's. Arm's and oil. Bipartisan criminality.
6165 2018-10-15 16:08:05 They're biggest worrie's are deficits and getting oil out of the ground as quickly as possible. Sad world we live in. #missthe70s

6167 2018-10-15 16:07:56 I started using bio oil on my face every night and a little bit every morning too and shit why didn’t anyone tell me about this shit sooner???? I can already see a difference in my skin

6170 2018-10-15 16:07:47 Privatizing is "an individual or group of individual taking control" of that resource (like a forest, a lake, the sea, water, oil, coal or whatever). Hardin didn´t write about "businesses and industries" in his "Tragedy of the Commons"...

6184 2018-10-15 16:06:53 Another reason we need to get of oil. As long as we require fossil fuels for energy we will be stuck dealing with dictatorships for the sake of our econ. Let's set a date to ban ICE engine production in the USA of around 2040.

6277 2018-10-15 16:01:09 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
6278 2018-10-15 16:01:07 The #SundayScaries are real. Last week, I began taking @FabCBD oil to see if it could help my anxiety. Last night, I slept like a baby. No grogginess today at all. And throughout each day, I've felt very relaxed. Placebo effect? Maybe. But so far I'm impressed & very pleased.

6280 2018-10-15 16:00:57 Yep yep, no oil, no natural resources, so you are fine brother.

6283 2018-10-15 16:00:38 My mom had a buckle and retnia surgery.  She had a choice of gas or oil behind her eye.  One dissolves the other doesn't.  One you have to keep your head down for two weeks or so.  She picked the other.  He didn't tell her it needed surgical removal, 14.000 4 his bill.

6285 2018-10-15 16:00:26 Watching Sears' long decline has been painful. My grandfather worked for them for over a decade. Our Christmases were "circle what you want in the Sears Wish Book and maybe Santa will deliver it." My parents got through the Oil Bust thanks to my grandfather's employee discount.

6287 2018-10-15 16:00:23 I’m a big fan of ozonated oil. Try that on those toes. I bet it would help, and it certainly wouldn’t hurt. Order from amazon. Pure O3 is the brand I get. I hope you feel better.
6288 2018-10-15 16:00:22 I’m operating under the assumption that Big Oil is just itching to tear apart a weakened Tesla.  I think that’s a pretty safe assumption considering how much lobbying and environmentally unfriendly practices take place in that industry.
6289 2018-10-15 16:00:21 The Peter Molyneux situation was a little different though. He was just trying to sell us snake oil every time he spoke.
6290 2018-10-15 16:00:18 @SenBobCorker should have demanded that he and ranking member Menendez go along with him. We can believe a f'ing thing Pompeo says. Remember, Pompeo is a Koch tea party alumni and will protect oil interests ahead of any human rights issue.
6291 2018-10-15 16:00:15 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.

6293 2018-10-15 16:00:07 Why is oil and gas the enemy? Thank you for letting me drive my car today, heat my home....live life...
6294 2018-10-15 15:59:59 It was a relic from another time, before the magic of electricity and flicker of glass enclosed glowing filament, it had borne the oil of rendered ocean mammal, a charred wick that lit waxy reflection of ambergris, whale's answer to intestinal irritant, perfumer's potion. #vss365
6295 2018-10-15 15:59:59 If they are not burning 25Kl of oil at about 50p a litre should be saving £12k. The other half is in part most to oil uses to cut pellet and transport wood. Still looks better overall but would hesitate to put 25kl on a red bus.
6296 2018-10-15 15:59:38 Didnt he say he talked to that one dude to make more oil so the gas price can drop (Which doesn't make any sense when you have a corrupt government)..Anyways...what's up with the gas prices bro?...was that fake news or what? Lol
6297 2018-10-15 15:59:23 Not really. Oil lamps work better.  My boss at my last job had a diffuser in his office that worked too
6298 2018-10-15 15:59:19 Who ever forgives student loan... I’ll vote. Simple as that. Take the damn weed. Bloat the military. Hide the bombs. Drill the oil. I don’t care. #studentloans #studentdebt #politics #democrats #republicans

6304 2018-10-15 15:58:33 Trump won't do anything to hurt his funding from Russian Oligarchs or Saudi Royal Family Oil Money.  He will tell his base he made his own millions without any help and they would soak it up like the little sponges they are. SAD

6307 2018-10-15 15:58:14 In the original HALLOWEEN, Michael Meyers drove that station wagon around a lot. He had to stop for gas at some point! What was that like? Did he check the oil? Clean the windshield? Ask them to turn on the air so he could inflate the tires???
6308 2018-10-15 15:58:11 They really think the own the whole world through their oil, and the fact that the US has armed them as well - if not better than the US itself.  Had friends that got out of the service to work 2 year contracts there for the Saudis, they were/are terrible employers.
6309 2018-10-15 15:58:08 Lots of countries are targeted for oil , Libya and Iraq for instance , they may have had dictators who needed removing but countries with no oil are left alone , oil is a bonus for countries but can also be heavy weight to carry....
6310 2018-10-15 15:58:04 Trump: "What'd he say?"

Pompeo: "He said they didn't do it."

Trump on Fox News: "He said they didn't do it. Very respectable man. Lots of oil. Good for American jobs."
6311 2018-10-15 15:57:59 Please update us on SD?  Management is moving too slow to take advantage of the opportunity in oil and gas!!
6312 2018-10-15 15:57:57 I definitely need to buy some oil bc I’m sure my dumb car has been burning it off lol

6318 2018-10-15 15:57:32 I think they would retaliate by throwing camel shit at us. Trump said that we now are a nation that sells oil as we have so much, so if they refused to sell us oil, it would mean nothing as we have so much oil.  Unless maybe Trump  lied?  Is that possible?
6319 2018-10-15 15:57:30 So you're in Lagos and you didn't tell us this is a treasonable felony

6321 2018-10-15 15:57:29 That’s interesting. As far as I’m aware though they’ve always used Mobil1 oil in their NASCAR’s so I don’t see how selling their own oil to a different company affects sponsorship. 

Maybe JGR will have primary sponsorship for a few races on top of SHR.

Entirely feasible.

6326 2018-10-15 15:57:02 Not sure if this mornings near death experience of skidding on an oil leak and almost crashing into a school bus serves as the perfect Monday morning metaphor but it certainly would’ve been a poetically ironic way for me to go. 
6327 2018-10-15 15:56:59 Anyone getting enough extra due to tax law in payck to offset rising cost? If so does is cover the Xtra cost to gas up car for pleasure&work?  How about home heating? I just priced oil. It's up .80 cents/gal compared to same time last yr., for my 300 gals thats a $240 increase.
6328 2018-10-15 15:56:59  i breakout bad, so yeah I don't want anybody hair/oil all in my face. How do folks do it? Idk

6330 2018-10-15 15:56:52 I think you need to look into the nature of the sanctions and the reason behind them before trying to blame USA for Venezuela’s colossal failure as an economy and their own inability to adjust to the end of their over-reliance on oil

6336 2018-10-15 15:56:28 Just watch. It will start getting slippery soon—and the Big Guys will move out of the market and oil prices will start to squeeze all those Mercedes, Lexis, Jeep, etc. SUV guzzlers. Then what, Mr Trump about stupid tariffs and let’s make a war threats?
6337 2018-10-15 15:56:17 Such accomplishments, 160 billion barrels of oil reserves unused that could potentially make Canada into an economic juggernaut now being given away hundreds of billions lost and investment thanks Papineau.
6338 2018-10-15 15:56:12 Haile Selassie let out 350,000 mi² of #Ogaden oilfield size of Texas and Oklahoma to #Sinclair Oil Company to explore & ship petroleum on Sept 6, 1945 as a quid pro quo to  win US.

6343 2018-10-15 15:55:53 And buy less oil. The money just flows into the pockets of the billion Koch Bros. Plus they finance campaigns against solutions like transit.
6344 2018-10-15 15:55:50 I really hate generalized statements. If your going to make statements back them up.  Ok where is KM oil going if you know so much and what price is it returning. What contractual commitments is it under. Try the truth & lay out the facts #TMX #CBC
6345 2018-10-15 15:55:45 To sum it up: the president is going to deny any Saudi involvement in the apparent assassination of @washingtonpost journalist #JamalKashoggi because he needs to continue kissing ass for oil...the very thing expediting the end of the world. Cool. Cool.

6349 2018-10-15 15:55:33 No we don't. Canada is a net exporter of energy by a 800% margin. 

Some oil companies choose to use Saudi oil but that is just the free market at work. 

Don't like it? Nationalize.
6350 2018-10-15 15:55:28 As long as they buy weapons from USA and keep shopping oil, you and the Trumpublicans will do nothing to the Kingdom.  You said it.  Saudi citizen in Saudi sovereign embassy.  Just like them killing any of their own citizens for criticizing the Royal Family in country.
6351 2018-10-15 15:55:24 If global warming is the existential great the warmists say it is, why are they still using fossil fuels? The he most pompous, preachy assholes like DiCaprio and Gore burn more oil than a small country.

6357 2018-10-15 15:54:47 Today’s meeting with oil companies is a PR exercise by Modi. No substantial approach is in sight to address this grave issue.
6358 2018-10-15 15:54:44 Gerry, I like your analogy- Gov plans to move past amputation and put extra funding into tools we can no longer use/grasp or manipulate for the betterment of our patients. It’s like a mechanic offering a fresh service & oil change when the engine block &  transmission are seized.
6359 2018-10-15 15:54:39 Thanks  I'm a huge believer in cb oil and now sell it through my website, as a cancer survivor I want everyone to try this, it really is earths magical potion!! Xxx

6368 2018-10-15 15:54:06 4% gdp, record unemployment for black,Hispanic,women, peace with n. Korea, millions of jobs added, nation unemployment 3%...ms13 gang bye bye, sex traffickers arrested in the thousands, fair trade tax, re-opening US steal and coal factories, now we are #1 in oil (SaudArab is 2)..
6369 2018-10-15 15:54:03 We expect strong #earnings gains to be driven mostly by solid #economic growth, particularly #manufacturing, and tax cuts. In addition, higher #oil prices should give energy sector profits a boost and the #interestrate environment has gotten better for #financial companies.
6370 2018-10-15 15:54:03 Ello sumado a los pocos incentivos a la industria, a la exploración concretamente, y a tener apenas 2 mercados hacen que en Bolivia sea muy poco atractivo invertir A ESCALA como en otros países. Ni hablar de fracking o de otros modelos de explotación oil/gas.

6374 2018-10-15 15:53:50 Oil does the trick--but for how long? All good things have to come to an end.

6380 2018-10-15 15:53:16 And that rogue killer is #USA. With the support of #Turkey. To acheive its brutal goals from KSA. Like cheaper oil, Increased oil production, High security price and buy more Arms from USA
6381 2018-10-15 15:53:14 According to the Minister of Energy, President John Mahama’s Govt gave out 13 oil blocks between 2013 and 2016; not a single one was by competitive tender; not a single of them was developed. Why?
6382 2018-10-15 15:53:10 Saudis don't have a future when oil is over & it will happen sooner than later, so they should not think that they can take the whole World for ransom with such blackmails in fact they are readying themselves to become the next Iraq.
6383 2018-10-15 15:53:07 $12000 for 10 days in Saudi-Arabia? To look at sand and oil? 
6384 2018-10-15 15:52:50 I don’t know anything about CBD oil laws in TN/what I’m allowed to buy/what works. Do any of my followers know wtf I should buy?

6393 2018-10-15 15:52:19 Really... but they’re pretty explicit in other ways o_o in using euphemism for butthole and d. What’s a vague “oil him up” gonna really add ...
6394 2018-10-15 15:52:18 Of shea butter or coconut oil?
6395 2018-10-15 15:52:16 Please take all Saudi Arabia for greater Israel. All. It’s yours. That oil is yours. You are backed by the planet.
6396 2018-10-15 15:52:07 gonna make an essential oil blend and call it “the situation”. that way if things get tense, i’ll always be able to diffuse the situation
6397 2018-10-15 15:52:01 Imagine the globe if oil barons (and politicians) hadn't fostered a devastating addiction to oil - Enviroment, Middle Peace, US politics, all better off.  Why don't these greedy bastards fund alternative energy??  Stupid? Myopic??  I'd rather be ripped off w/o killing the planet.
6398 2018-10-15 15:51:57 I think everybody knows by now that plastics - for one - are also petroleum products, and due to their ubiquity, we can't just plug Big Oil over night. I believe most people wish to do the right thing but also understand that it's a complex problem with a complex solution.
6399 2018-10-15 15:51:45 Crude oil Apr19 40.5 Puts trade 140 times
6400 2018-10-15 15:51:43 Every Essential Oil contains more than 100 individual components. When you distill plant material, the Oils become highly Concentrated and significantly more Potent. For example, one drop of Peppermint Oil contains the same amount of active compounds as 28 cups of Peppermint Tea.
6401 2018-10-15 15:51:34 If you’re feeling Monday stress add peppermint oil to back of your neck. I promise you, you won’t regret it!  #honitip
6402 2018-10-15 15:51:26 I'm also quite confused!!!  Baby oil???? How.... Whyyyyyy???  
6403 2018-10-15 15:51:25 don't mind eating it but i personally feel like
a) animals are dying at too rapid a rate bc of pollution and oil spills and lesser habitats etc
b) we used them for so many experimental studies. we as a species cannot be the only ones standing at the end. the predatory heirarchy +
6404 2018-10-15 15:51:23 Correct but JGR use to have their own oil, JGR Driven. They sold that company to Comp cams a little over a year ago.
6405 2018-10-15 15:51:15 Have you tried using natural oils? Most bugs don't like the smell of eucalyptus. Dilute some oil in water and spray on your plants.
6406 2018-10-15 15:51:09 so here was my self-care this weekend, friends: 
- bought some new products (peach sake toner! a lip mask! tinted lip oil!)
- bought some old favorites (no7 beautifully matte foundation!)

6407 2018-10-15 15:51:07 Disgusting. Just some olive oil, garlic, prosciutto and parmesan will do.
6408 2018-10-15 15:50:56 Selling USTs isn't the "nuclear option"; China's been doing this for 5 yrs, & @Brad_Setser is right that Fed can buy all they'd sell.  The nuclear option is cleaning London & NYC out of physical gold, &/or openly creating a "2nd gold market" in oil terms that would do so.
6409 2018-10-15 15:50:54 What to expect when an under-qualified over-confident inexperienced Youngman #MBS takes over #Saudi military, economy, oil, foreign policy, the intelligence and religious establishments, on his own, launches a war and provokes one diplomatic crisis after another! #JamalKhashoogi
6410 2018-10-15 15:50:52 I hope you lose your seat in the next election, you've done nothing for Calgary, Alberta, or Canada! Except drive investment away and create high unemployment in the oil sector!
6411 2018-10-15 15:50:38 I hope you can understand that I believe human rights are universal. That execution is wrong (including in the west) that jailing people indefinitely is wrong, that waging war over oil is wrong (esp. in the west), and that the oppression of minorities is wrong.
6412 2018-10-15 15:50:34 LIAR!!  Saudi told trump "we have the oil you need" and trump THE COWARD, backed down from his bragging that he'd take them to task for the murder, showing he's NOT a leader in any sense of the word.  The bully embarrassment got a dose of his own medicine!
6413 2018-10-15 15:50:24 @StarKistCharlie hey if y'all want to sponsor me to be a walking advertisement for your tuna that comes in olive oil I'm down. I genuinely love that stuff, and I'm already telling friends and family about it

6415 2018-10-15 15:50:14 Maybe he shat himself over what would happen to the oil price and his voter base ahead of midterms
6416 2018-10-15 15:50:13 Lmao how long can you go without a oil change 
6417 2018-10-15 15:50:12 Which green groups have been silent on climate change? It’s the oil and gas industry and the politicians they fund who are to blame for not taking action on this 30 years ago.
6418 2018-10-15 15:50:09 With all that oil money, Nigeria can't even manage her citizen's pension records? What's this lack of funds or just plain incompetence.
6419 2018-10-15 15:49:39 US now holds high ranking as a top exporter of oil via fracking so we R no longer slaves 2 Saudis or Canada. No longer bowing down @ oil royalty like the former muslim in chief did in leading from (his) behind.
6420 2018-10-15 15:49:19 You will be fine.  Just make sure you always have bottles of cooking oil and matches/lighters.  I always like to keep hairspray and lighters around just in case, makes for a good blow torch/flame thrower they hate that!!

6423 2018-10-15 15:49:12 The path outside of red restaurant on the princess street side hasn’t been cleaned in years, and the dirty bas*rd restaurants let all kinds of food and oil spill all over it...and the council do nothing
6424 2018-10-15 15:49:11 Oh no. I get them sometimes. Not any more. I didn't know they'd changed. I don't want anything with palm oil anyway.
6425 2018-10-15 15:49:05 1927- Iraq strikes it's first gusher of oil. The gusher was so large it took 8 days to bring under control.
6426 2018-10-15 15:48:59 The U.S. is complicit in many nasty things as well. You should see the casualties from Yemen. But hey, ignore all of that.... because... oil.
6427 2018-10-15 15:48:56 A review on the smell of wasps.

Just squashed a wasp that's been crawling on my arm. It had a very strange smell. Imagine the smell of the seats of a car that's been mixed with some oil and left to dry during a day in a desert.

TL;DR: It smells bad and my arm is kind of itchy.
6428 2018-10-15 15:48:43 3) To end this discussion, the US and Saudi relationship, long bound by common interests in oil and security, each one of us know that if we cut this relationship is a catastrophic move. We enjoy a huge influence over GCC and in international politics.

6431 2018-10-15 15:48:13 U.S. Military Is World’s Biggest Polluter: 'Producing more hazardous waste than the five largest U.S. chemical companies combined, the U.S. DoD has left its toxic legacy throughout the world in the form of depleted uranium, oil, jet fuel, pesticides, defoliants...'
6432 2018-10-15 15:48:04 Good for Iran to play the long game....
Oil fields in Saudi are drying up. Equillibrium is killing their output and their influence. Buh bye.
6433 2018-10-15 15:47:48 Mr. Frum, isn't 90% of Canadian oil owned by American companies (Koch Industries)?
6434 2018-10-15 15:47:46 Saudi just made it Clear any stupid sanctions definitely will raise Oil price and hurt global economy that is fact not threat it is not as your media manipulate the reports to fit your goal
6435 2018-10-15 15:47:41 If Manchester United sell to the Saudi’s what happens to those human rights and oil money arguments they’ve been throwing at City fans for the last decade?
6436 2018-10-15 15:47:40 It's interesting history. Both US and UK helped extract oil in both countries. One was fundamentalist the other not. We've managed to stay close with the consistently fundamentalist one.
6437 2018-10-15 15:47:24 Chef Louis cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with sushi.
6438 2018-10-15 15:47:22 0.3% has gotta get you an oil well or two, right?
6439 2018-10-15 15:47:20 lol @ 2hrs for an oil change
6440 2018-10-15 15:47:17 OMG!!!!! This is such a mistake! We could ALWAYS use some more investment-specially some  "Crowned Prince" oil cash 
6441 2018-10-15 15:47:06 Media going after KSA puts them in a no win situation. They can’t please anyone. Might as well just let the money pour in.

Saudis killing = higher oil prices.
6442 2018-10-15 15:47:05 You need to read more than the oil company brochures.
6443 2018-10-15 15:47:04 It’s a long long day for me 
6444 2018-10-15 15:47:00 Going to add castor oil to the detox routine. We'll see how it does.
6445 2018-10-15 15:46:53 Or we could nationalize oil and gas, or atleast partially. The US has enough to fuel our country for atleast a century more. We need to shift away from dependence on fossil fuels though. That is the key to the future.
6446 2018-10-15 15:46:47 I just meant on balance (and I'm not 100% on that either).  Certainly higher gas prices mean things are more expensive but the US is now the largest extractor of oil in the world so that also means more oils service industry jobs & investment.
6447 2018-10-15 15:46:45 Splashed myself with hot oil.  Now I have a blister. Or I did till my 1 year old kicked it.
6448 2018-10-15 15:46:42 omg spaghetti with just olive oil and salt and pepper is sooooo good
6449 2018-10-15 15:46:40 I wonder how many baked goods don't contain palm oil??
6450 2018-10-15 15:46:20 Not sure why people think Big Science is conspiring to upend the world with all this climate change "nonsense". If there is any group with an agenda it is Big Oil. Pretty straight forward. Is cleaner air for your kids a BAD thing? Is reducing emissions a SIN? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
6451 2018-10-15 15:46:19 Americans and Russians and OPEC has formed cartel this will oil destroy world economy we are at brink of world economy collapse
6452 2018-10-15 15:46:14 Just stop buying oil from KSA and they will go belly up in a few months.  There are plenty of oil elsewhere like in Iran and, Iraq. There are a lot more business opportunities for better reason than selling arms to KSA to bomb innocent Yemenis.
6453 2018-10-15 15:46:05 Her plan did nothing. Emmissions R lower from cleaner burning vehicles, oil industry GHG reductions and phase out of cola power. All done without any federally mandated CO2 tax
6454 2018-10-15 15:46:03 drunken babbling does not change the fact that it's Scotland's oil.

6456 2018-10-15 15:45:50 Your despised Pot of Oil is enough to impact your world. Look inward and recognize it and make use of it
6457 2018-10-15 15:45:47 #Trump's 1980 world view came home to roost today in failed energy policy 1,Over placates the Saudi's as if it was 1980 gving very wrong signals, 2, Sanctions Iran to pacify GOP base causing #oil market to tighten, 3, won't support alternative energy in US ie Oil market goes wild
6458 2018-10-15 15:45:45 Is 'arab oil money' still ridiculing if it's said about your own club?

Asking on behalf of City fans
6459 2018-10-15 15:45:43 Modern coal fired plants, even oil fired plants, have sophisticated electrostatic precipitators, that filter out all GHGs, NOx, Sox & COx gases.

So pollution isn’t an immediate problem & hinderance to exploiting coal 4 power generation in Nigeria.

Our bane is lack of TECHNOLOGY
6460 2018-10-15 15:45:32 Hot take: Nobody is taking climate change seriously. If they were we'd have widespread ecoterrorism. Blowing up coal mines & power plants, assassinating oil & car company CEOs, piracy to seize tankers. We see this kind of action on whaling but not climate.

6468 2018-10-15 15:45:03 As for "being better off outside EU", not really. The £ has already dropped 20% and we haven't even left. The £ dropping was presented as a good thing but as most things like oil are sold on the world market in $s, the price of everything will actually go UP
6469 2018-10-15 15:45:00 If you’ve got dry skin, opt for a face oil instead of a lightweight lotion. The all day hydration will change your skin for the better.

6475 2018-10-15 15:44:27 The Saudi's threat to withhold oil from the market and raise the price of crude oil if Trump punishes them is a hollow threat.  Doing so will create financial incentives for the U.S. shale oil industry to increase crude oil production & it will create thousands of new jobs.
6476 2018-10-15 15:44:24 when i was a kid in 60s & 70s, billionaires barely existed outside of gulf oil sheikhs. the concept was as real as that of zillionaires. my late father was midlevel mgr, we had 1 car, mom at home, 3 kids to college w/o loans. then came reagan, as @JCBwellUS pointed out.
6477 2018-10-15 15:44:17 Trumps new sanctions on the Saudis will only do one thing, send oil prices through the roof making them even richer than they already are
6478 2018-10-15 15:44:14 Saudi media claim Kingdom is mulling to retaliate with following if US impose sanctions:

1) Invitation of Russian military base
2) Friendship with Iran
3) Oil trade in yuan
4) Oil price may be increased to 200 dol
5) Will stab US economy to death

.... the list goes on to 30

6483 2018-10-15 15:43:33 People also ignore that UK oil/gas production means we regulate it ourselves during the energy transition, which means we can monitor and reduce emissions. If we import from Qatar etc then are the figures academics use to calc CO2 footprint even valid? etc. Who knows.

6488 2018-10-15 15:43:15 Never made sense to sell oil cheaper than the cost of getting it out of the ground.
6489 2018-10-15 15:43:12 Trump: How do they threaten you that the price of oil will become $ 200 in the case of the war against Saudi Arabia? Where do they have a currency exchange to the Chinese yuan? How will they sell oil?

6499 2018-10-15 15:42:39 There are imaginary to you, but why don’t you go to West Virginia and ask if Trump actions are imaginary, or aske the oil and gas producers? Look at the DOW, ask the grass roots people if their tax reduction is imaginary! They are NOT crumbs! Ask the black people that NOW...
6500 2018-10-15 15:42:35 If the spread is the point then doesn’t it make sense for Canada to substitute Saudi oil with WCS? Canadian oil seems like the far more competitive choice to me as it trades for ~$60 discount.
6501 2018-10-15 15:42:25 Between 150 and 400 million years ago, there’s a .00000000000000001% chance that her ancestors were Native American. Pretty much proves it.

6504 2018-10-15 15:42:08 Be careful, can't trust them. We could make a North America Oil Alliance with Canada, Mexico, Venezuela. Give the Saudis a run for their money. Force them to keep the price down,
6505 2018-10-15 15:42:05 I blame who raised you, the whole African woman can't cook or just to boil oil and through chips inside and wait for the output ? I give Mzanzi
6506 2018-10-15 15:41:51 Best evidence is empirical. It has been shown that taxes on oil and gas follow the curve. If you raise the tax rate, and get reduced revenue; then decrease the rate, but get INCREASED revenue, it means the laffer curve applies.

Which it does.

6515 2018-10-15 15:41:17 So, why R CDN GHG emissions dropping, without any federally mandated CO2 tax? Cleaner gas/diesel burning vehicles, oil industry efficiencies and eliminating coal power, that's why.

6538 2018-10-15 15:39:39 That’s what they said in Venezuela when they socialized the oil co’s, now a country with one of the largest oil reserves pumps NO oil, most of us will pass on the govt taking more control of health care #justsaying

6541 2018-10-15 15:39:30 I think could be quid pro quo..... look the other way on execution for more oil.
6542 2018-10-15 15:39:28 No, that has nothing to do with the pipeline. Refining Canadian oil is the most expensive in the world. It takes over $200 per barrel to just break even.
6543 2018-10-15 15:39:28 Coconut  Oil +Natural Glow! Ok 
6544 2018-10-15 15:39:28 ....as long as they have oil!
6545 2018-10-15 15:39:27 It’s an empty threat as $400 a barrel oil will create irrevocable shift to more efficient technologies which will lower the total value of Saudi reserves.  This is why the Saudis haven’t been trying to push prices up.  Even $100 a barrel causes different consumer choices.

6572 2018-10-15 15:36:39 Getting a lot of questions about whether we see a repeat of the 1973 oil shocks. The answer is no, and here's why:
Market conditions that allowed OPEC & OAPEC to control prices at that time are not present here. Both Russia & US produce more oil than Saudi Arabia right now. #OOTT
6573 2018-10-15 15:36:33 "U.S. goal is for countries to cut Iranian oil imports to zero as quickly as possible."

The Iraq oil sanction proved how futile that is.  Oil is a commodity. It will get sold somewhere.
6574 2018-10-15 15:36:31 Use the oil much more pure and no chemicals. 
6575 2018-10-15 15:36:30 Dems/RINO/MSM in an attempt to tank our economy before midterms are demanding we “punish” Saudi Arabia. In doing so our own economy will suffer when Saudis increase oil prices and billions of dollars in military contracts with Saudis are canceled.

6585 2018-10-15 15:36:00 I definitely prefer bringing my cars to the dealership for oil changes - it's only about $5-$10 more and it's much more comfortable. Granted, my cars are (really) old Toyotas, but I've heard that VWs are notoriously tricky on routine maintenance.
6586 2018-10-15 15:35:47 Thanks bud! :) 
It pains me to see people overworked, even if they are doing what they love. I believe everything is about having a perfect balance. Sure burning the midnight oil might be necessary at some points, but never on a regular basis.

6593 2018-10-15 15:35:23 We would also strongly urge the public to take note of the hundreds of studies that show fracking (unconventional oil and gas extraction) is a dangerous process that has no place in our future in such a small densely populated country and cannot be regulated or managed.

They are, for instance, more socialist than the EU countries. Plus, EU countries are not democratic socialists. Some of them probably socialdemocracies+
6608 2018-10-15 15:33:39 Biggest reason is that it contains more saturated fat than butter or lard. You're better off using just using butter than coconut oil tbh. Although olive oil is one of the best for health.

Help me out here.....

In 2008 the price for crude oil was $145/barrel and the gasoline price was $3.75/gallon.

Today, crude oil prices are at $71/barrel(less than HALF of what it was 10 years ago)....so gasoline prices are about $3.00/gallon.

Why?
6670 2018-10-15 15:28:38 r we gonna look back in 10 years and say fish oil most over promoted dietary supplement of all time ?
6671 2018-10-15 15:28:34 Still want an independent, poor Scotland, without oil living under the EU Growth and Stability pact. Or maybe you should Foxtrot Oscar to an EU state and stop trying to make people in the UK poorer?

6680 2018-10-15 15:27:32 President Trump: American People do not want to go to a all out World War over a few crooks in US gov't who insist on trying to steal Syria's Oil. The most responsible thing is withdraw US Forces from Syria like you promised the American People you would do if Elected. Well??????
6681 2018-10-15 15:27:29 It probably will be but i dont want our club being owned by murderers. Plus we've always made fun of City being funded by oil money, we'll end up being the same
6682 2018-10-15 15:27:21 and @powrotroberta claims that Lotos(polish state oil company) is good chance to rehabilitation since right now they have to pay much less than Santander.
6683 2018-10-15 15:27:14 and fossil fuels didn't cause #climatechange. these lying, billionaire fascists are murdering the future to sell more weapons, drill more oil, and buy more yachts. the democratic party needs to propose far-reaching, serious, climate goals or what is the point of them?
6684 2018-10-15 15:27:13 You'd need to ask the researchers, but this is what happened last time. High earning oil workers moving in will impact on house values despite slippage elsewhere in the labour market.
6685 2018-10-15 15:27:04 It's mostly snake oil. In perception, Pence had some regional appeal and shored up conservative support. Biden shored up working class/labor support for BHO. Cheney, was thought to make us feel better about a "baby" & "intellectual lightweight". Post-hoc rationalizations

6687 2018-10-15 15:26:45 I looked at the Brexit elite - Jacob Rees Mogg, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage - and saw snake oil salesman. I didn’t think those wealthy, privileged men understood or particularly cared about the working classes of Taunton“
6688 2018-10-15 15:26:39 It was about $OIL all along. Bush & Clinton family are very good friends with the saudis ... almost "family"

6690 2018-10-15 15:26:35 We dont need these picnic table cloth wearing assholes  we be already proven we can produce oil at $50/barrel

6693 2018-10-15 15:26:25 Actual and circumstantial evidence meets the criteria for beyond reasonable doubt.
...except if you're capable of hiking oil prices, buying arms from Russia and bringing the dollar down.
Is that morally defensible?
6694 2018-10-15 15:26:13 Those 'crime camps' infect surrounding communities. Local law enforcement is either unable or unwilling (due to bribes from the oil co to local leadership) to step up to the challenge. Damn disgrace.

6698 2018-10-15 15:25:45 Nixon completely removed the Gold Standard from the dollar in the 70s. The only reason why the dollar kept its value is that we made a deal with Saudia Arabia. We said we would protect them as long as they forced all Nations to buy Oil w/ the US Dollar aka Petro Dollar.
6699 2018-10-15 15:25:41 Every time I go to jiffy lube, I tell myself “just an oil change, you don’t need anything else” and then proceed with spending $160
6700 2018-10-15 15:25:41 It's cruel to sell houses at a premium knowing that there is no oil business. These poor souls will be left penniless. The facts were made clear. There should be laws against this sort of misinformation.
6701 2018-10-15 15:25:38 It helps having someone that can shoot the puck though. When you look at the PP’s I mentioned they all rank amongst the best, believe Oilers would be better off if they can find someone for that umbrella/shooting format that can bomb one timers. Doesn’t necessarily need to be a D

6711 2018-10-15 15:24:09 buzzfeed and journalism kinda like oil and water?
6712 2018-10-15 15:24:08 Totally disagree. He never said % of Indian. Or Indian by some other American Indian definition (usually used to receive oil revenues). She has some American Indian blood. End of story. Trumo got played.

6730 2018-10-15 15:22:47 They are our biggest customer for weapons sales. And they control our oil prices. Think again.
6731 2018-10-15 15:22:42 We are taking out too much of oil and gas from the ground the earth has to adjust herself some parts will sink to the earth the earthquake will get stronger than before the earth magnetic is moving too, if the earth flipped don't blame no one, but ourselves.

6753 2018-10-15 15:20:38 Tell @POTUS - if he really wants to hurt the Saudis long-term (and he should), and employ millions of AMERICANS and make trillions of $ for AMERICANS, he should stimulate the US electric vehicle and alternative energy market.

6757 2018-10-15 15:19:59 Does it come surprising at all for Saudi Arabia to torture and kill a journalist and use oil as a weapon against sanctions? What's actually surprising is the rest of the World believe in their lying regime. Saudi's are the worst representation -if not the enemies, of Islam.
6758 2018-10-15 15:19:59 So... the Trump response to #climatechange is to Ignore it because it's too difficult to deal with; therefore give tax-breaks to oil & coal but Don't help renewables. This will be the Trump-GOP policy -- a Disater for Future generations. DEMs -- make the #Environment a #1 Topic !

6765 2018-10-15 15:19:44 The bid-ask spread on Canadian oil is far smaller than that number at ANY time in the last 10 years, no matter what the diffs are trading at.  It is a massive number, you were implying that it was minor, no?
6766 2018-10-15 15:19:43 Saudis are planning to build an industrial economy to reduce dependency on oil revenues.
6767 2018-10-15 15:19:28 I need to get my oil changed soon but I don’t feel like waiting

6776 2018-10-15 15:18:42 I think most mainstream journalists are aware that climate change is man-made, and their editors, executives and shareholders are well aware that oil advertising profits are also man-made.
6777 2018-10-15 15:18:34 Appeasement ...like giving in to the number 1  court at Wimbledon lol! The squeaky wheel fans finally getting the oil.
6778 2018-10-15 15:18:25 You are right on the money there bro, spot on. We can be a dependent country on our own Cus we have so much resources and only really lacking oil. The rest we have but the way it's being used is frustrating
6779 2018-10-15 15:18:21 Redwood says no deal is better than a bad deal. And we can spend the money on more of our own plans. Redwood is probably one of the dumbest and untrustworthy members of a government of snake oil salesman.Our own plans  dose he means more tax avoidance.

6798 2018-10-15 15:17:29 I was thinking that Saudi Arabia would threaten to cut oil production to influence global prices, but that might be a last resort. Don't want to go to that option first without other incremental ones.

6815 2018-10-15 15:16:17 our office tech thought the answer to my staff needing heat in their office since it's 20 degrees and they don't have heat and they didn't crank their one oil heater up last thursday before they left for the weekend, is to "educate them"...

6833 2018-10-15 15:14:49 Build3x could have triggered a demand-pull, rising ME oil price then added a cost-pull, typhoons and rice hoarding added more and TRAIN resulted to higher take-home-pay for middle class also raised demand. All still within expected models but sign of a moving economy.

6855 2018-10-15 15:12:41 You should educate yourself more about oil prices. It’s not a grocery store. The price depends on different factors: supply, demand and geopolitics.

6872 2018-10-15 15:11:39 “Eco-Terrorists”. I’m just wondering are they planning a hostile takeover of natural resource sites by force? Kidnapping oil CEOs? Environmentalists yes, terrorists? That sounds pretty hyperbolic no?

6878 2018-10-15 15:11:24 For those buildings on strategic infrastructure like areas earmarked for roads extensions, oil pipelines, etc should be demolished and the government compensated the owners because it’s not their fault. The rest should be spared & mitigated

But for some reason everyone looks at you funny if you ask to pet a baby's butt shark, so maybe don't do that.
6881 2018-10-15 15:10:55 Well, they are getting exploited by the chinese for their oil the last time I checked.

 Please stop telling me that oil prices will skyrocket if we get in a dispute with Saudi Arabia.

The US gets 50% of its oil imports from Canada and Mexico. Saudi Arabia doesn't amount to 10% of our oil imports. Stop the bullshit.
6884 2018-10-15 15:10:38 Then again, cheap oil will fuck a lot of nasty regimes over

6887 2018-10-15 15:10:26 The “oil weapon” is rapidly diminishing as US production spikes.  OPEC has very little leverage now, and it will disappear altogether with a few price spikes.

6890 2018-10-15 15:10:18 Add to that the certainty that Canada's complete and sudden withdrawal from the oil business would make absolutely no difference to global emissions and it's clear that the environmentalists are only fighting to kill jobs and gain empty bragging rights.

6897 2018-10-15 15:10:00 It actually fucking crushes me that palm oil is such an unavoidable substance, considering how destructive it is towards Orangutan’s habitats and is basically what’s gonna drive them to extinction in my lifetime
6898 2018-10-15 15:09:55 Even when his AZ colleague John McCain voted to save the methane rule, which was developed by working with oil&gas to provide a standard for them to reduce emissions, Flake chose to lie about it and vote to repeal it.

6903 2018-10-15 15:09:20 I was enamored too but ended up not really liking Aloha due to the strong jasmine scent, I can never understand how others find the scent beautiful and uplifting. I'm using it as a body oil instead 
6904 2018-10-15 15:09:09 Oh boy, I brought up coconut oil for cosmetic use, and my new cubicle mate said "oh yeah, I love it, I use it for everything! I replaced all my cooking oils with it because I wanted to get away from those carcinogenic GMOs."

... bruh. I hope you realise that everything is a GMO.

6906 2018-10-15 15:09:05 You just described text book propaganda Mrs. Musk . Elon leads the revolution of freeing people from oil dependence . The whole world watches in disgust how “media” faults Tesla for trying to push humanity forward .will keep fighting untill mission accomplished !

6908 2018-10-15 15:08:58 I swear if a new HOD doesn’t hit in Oil, I quit trading.
6909 2018-10-15 15:08:56 If Middle East nations like Saudi Arabia are historically bad actors, why does the US insist on dependence of oil rather than investing in alternative energy sources? That would not only help the environment, but also free us from despotic regimes.
6910 2018-10-15 15:08:51 Oil makes the world go round. We will never ever stop kissing the arse of people who commit genocide if it’s good for the economy. Another reason we need a huge shift away from fossil fuels.
6911 2018-10-15 15:08:50 Fair comment Cagguila is way over paid.

6913 2018-10-15 15:08:29 On Monday, the Malaysian Prime Minister said China has agreed to purchase 500,000 mt of palm oil, and expects the Chinese to offer a competitive price for the vegoil. Source: Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
6914 2018-10-15 15:08:24 so now I want to do a talk on how fancy Americans are eating polos as a pulled pork substitute, cooking all their foods using lowly coconut oil, and munching away on mung ata. also tbh I selfishly cannot wait until red rice goes superfood-mainstream.
6915 2018-10-15 15:08:24 Iranian hostage crisis
Iranian oil embargo
Ayatollah’s branding the US “the Great Satan,” Iranian proxies in Lebanon & elsewhere attacking US. Of course, US installed & propped up the Shah, so we reap what we sowed.
6916 2018-10-15 15:08:16 Wow!!! That looks like an oil painting! Very "Golden-Age-Holy-Trinity" of you! (By which I mean Knight, Burian, and Zallinger.)
6917 2018-10-15 15:08:07 Again, your lack of knowledge on matters economic is astounding.

I repeat. When taxes on oil are increased, REVENUES go down. When taxes are DECREASED, government revenues go UP.

See: Laffer Curve
6918 2018-10-15 15:08:04 And don’t get kick-backs or bailouts from the oil and auto industry.
6919 2018-10-15 15:07:59 This is happening globally for Gods sake! A result of the trade war, cooling economies and oil prices. Why can’t the media educate people rather than being prophets of doom!
6920 2018-10-15 15:07:55 I did a whole post on that oil after finding out it has the exact same ingredient list as the Herbivore Lapis oil. It’s so good!!!
6921 2018-10-15 15:07:55 woke up early to get my oil changed :-) adulting can be stressful sometimes but we all have to do it! #JustDoIt

6923 2018-10-15 15:07:51 Lovely place for all, excellent olive oil.
6924 2018-10-15 15:07:49 Finally tried cbd oil and I am not disappointed at all. Anyone dealing with a lot of anxiety or stress I highly recommend trying it!
6925 2018-10-15 15:07:27 @TrueCareINTERN you know  understand that anointing oil of favour ,the King favoured ester who was not a virgin amongst all virgins i like it King not God even David took a woman who was not a virgin and God was not happy
6926 2018-10-15 15:07:23 Saudi Arabia not like Iran , think twice  before even think to impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia as this will in somehow affects you and your economy. Take the oil for example, do you think $ will be the dominant currency in importing and exporting it!! Again , think twice.

6929 2018-10-15 15:07:09 no resources or ££ in for the leading governments to utilise. Can invade countries for oil etc but cant find cash to help situations like this 
6930 2018-10-15 15:06:57 Just a question. If they couldn’t get to the beach communities overland why not use landing craft to land men and equipment. Don’t we have such craft.  

Let the Saudis raise the price of oil. That would mean they might drill on my land. They said it wasn’t worth if under 80.

6940 2018-10-15 15:06:10 Your oil wasn't hot enough
6941 2018-10-15 15:06:08 It’s really so frustrating. Just a little PSA: make sure to change your oil kids 
6942 2018-10-15 15:06:01 @mishalalharbe1 سلام عليكم في عندكم هذه قطعه  Hydraulic oil Power Steering Pump
6943 2018-10-15 15:05:55 Your hair looks as if something died on your head girl. You need a V05 hot oil treatment, like yesterday. 
6944 2018-10-15 15:05:42 Oregano oil and lots of rest.
6945 2018-10-15 15:05:40 Your forehead is brighter than my future

Umepaka anointing oil ama ni effects za coco butter?
6946 2018-10-15 15:05:36 なんでそんな下乳に反応してるの…？？
6947 2018-10-15 15:05:36 In understand. Replacing oil at least partly by EVs would probably require more increase in global energy usage than the aforementioned conservative WWF plan includes. Which is a lot. Therefore: more low C electricity from lowest footprint source possible, as fast as possible.
6948 2018-10-15 15:05:29 Snake oil salesman
6949 2018-10-15 15:05:23 wow i told my dad i need a oil change he gon say “whatchu telling me for?” 
6950 2018-10-15 15:05:17 I can't help but feel that condeming Saudi Arabia for widepsread human rights abuses and murdering an American journalist would be easier if we had transitioned to renewable energy sources a long time ago instead of relying on their oil to fuel everything.
6951 2018-10-15 15:05:17 Here it comes - the Rightwing will let this all slide - Koch brothers - BIG OIL MONEY - watch - I have a feeling this is going to be bad !!! Trump is ALL ABOUT THE $$$ bottom line !!
6952 2018-10-15 15:05:14 Think you're thinking of oil FUTURES. Which go up and down like any other commodity. SA is a member of OPEC. Which means they can control production. They can decrease supply and raise oil prices but ONLY if the body agrees to it
6953 2018-10-15 15:05:11 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
6954 2018-10-15 15:05:00 Fascinating how:
Scientists have a “political agenda”,
But oil & gas industries don’t.
6955 2018-10-15 15:04:51 Haha nice. Olive oil, anchovies and chili is also nice.
6956 2018-10-15 15:04:49 He might admit that it’s them, but at the minute they’ve threatened to weaponise oil and plunge the world into a recession so there’s not a lot anyone we can do
6957 2018-10-15 15:04:44 I guess u understand English...... Countries might have been hit with crude oil shock but it depends on the country to manage its resources Saudi Arabia manage it well if u may know and besides I tot u buharist said ur lifeless president made agriculture our top commodity income
6958 2018-10-15 15:04:39 
6959 2018-10-15 15:04:34 @mitchdul The difference between guys like Dano, Aberg, and Cagguila isn’t much. But $$$?
6960 2018-10-15 15:04:34 Lol I thought the same. I remember I was on Snapchat and someone asked was I sweating, I was soooo mad. I realized my face produces more oil when I don't use moisturizer. So I make sure I use EVERY day lol
6961 2018-10-15 15:04:31 In order for the Saudis to turn anything around, they need to get away from the Oligarchy and oil reserves... and that certainly isn't happening any time soon :(
6962 2018-10-15 15:04:23 US is the #1 weapons dealer in the world. Saudi Arabia is our biggest customer. And they control oil prices hence our economy. This goes way beyond Trump.
6963 2018-10-15 15:04:21 51 Canadian citizens died at the rail disaster at Lac Megantic.  Few if any have died as a result of an oil pipeline spill.   We have to find a way to move this oil by pipeline before the next rail incident.
6964 2018-10-15 15:04:04 Sounds good. I sometimes do this sort of thing with tomato ketchup, olive oil and cheese.
6965 2018-10-15 15:04:04 US indices looking set for a fall , OIL will also go with it & GOLD  a safe heaven. $1350 - 1400 target over the nxt 3 months.
6966 2018-10-15 15:04:03 My dad comes in my room
-“Nicole give me your keys I’m going to check your oil & water.. when did you get a nose ring?”
- dad, I’ve had it since i was 16 
6967 2018-10-15 15:04:02 you shave and oil up for each presbycast, don't ya?
6968 2018-10-15 15:03:46 We weren't supposed to tell anybody... but i fw yall so boom there you go.  That's why oil is so good
6969 2018-10-15 15:03:39 Kebodohan hari ini :
Face oil dipakein ke rambut (emang bisa buat rambut katanya), terus sekarang i punya rambut kaya belom keramas 3hari padahal baru tadi sore keramas 
6970 2018-10-15 15:03:37 I'm fairly certain it mostly involves airfields and oil and just snowballed. 1979 really turned us off to Iran.

But the policy is dumb. They are awful and their shitty relationships drive all the other problems.

If only anyone could get us unhooked from oil.
6971 2018-10-15 15:03:36 They drown you in oil in the Andean Grand Hotel.
6972 2018-10-15 15:03:30 From today’s #Introit 
Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
6973 2018-10-15 15:03:06 I adore the new shampoo bar cause it makes ur hair feel healthy AND grow like crazy but also the Damaged hot oil treatment mask!!! it's for damaged hair so it's super good if you use dyes and or bleaches (or even heat)
6974 2018-10-15 15:03:02 Looks like castor oil

Obviously it's one of their bad market week 
6979 2018-10-15 15:02:20 จะยื่นเด่นเป็นสง่า กลางถนนเลย คอยดูนะ
6980 2018-10-15 15:02:10 Their oil pricing in dollars is a big part of why USD is reserve currency. A switch could hurt us bad. But then we'll pull our navy and it'll be open season. Instant US shale dominance.

Again.. bad for everyone. Least bad for USA. We'd have to cut our budget tremendously though.
6981 2018-10-15 15:02:05 Sir ji , powerful electric battery jaldi mkt mn aye to oil ki problem jaldi Sulaz jayegi,import bill Pichai jayega
6982 2018-10-15 15:02:00 Should be overturned this judge is obviously going to be biased to the side of the oil industry
6983 2018-10-15 15:01:50 Actually, it is Quebec that doesn't want Alberta oil passing over its territory. The Atlantic provinces would welcome it.
6984 2018-10-15 15:01:46 Saudi Arabia has ZERO influence on President Trump.  He makes his OWN decisions, unlike former Ptesident Obama who was beholden to the Saudis who paid for his Harvard Education.  Likewise with G.W. Bush who was loaned $25 mln to start his first oil company.
6985 2018-10-15 15:01:36 2º example: i work in a car factory that builds 60 cars by day ( combustion ), to build them we need 40 galons of oil, 5 kilos of silver, etc ..

Since the "green" cars started to be manufacture, now we build 70 cars ( 60 combustion and 10 eco ) = 60 galons of oil required now ..
6986 2018-10-15 15:01:36 The auto shop man said it would only take Cappadonna's verse from Winter Warz to change my oil. Not bad.
6987 2018-10-15 15:01:24 5555555555555 รอวันเกิดพี่จินๆนะอย่าหลบล่ะ
6988 2018-10-15 15:01:22 I know I’m heartbroken!
6989 2018-10-15 15:01:15 Saudi produces ~10m barrels and exports ~6m. American does not export to ME and actually Saudi is the second biggest imported oil market to US. US produces 10m and consumes all of it. Oh also, US doesn’t have the same refining capacity as Saudi. Saudi has 2m spare capacity too.
6990 2018-10-15 15:01:13 Because if you think we should be selling oil at that price, are you suggesting Canada forces upgrading on private companies, or that Canada upgrades the oil ourselves?
6991 2018-10-15 15:01:09 I was five back then, running back and forth from my mom's seat to the entrance of Equitable PCI Paseo Gil Puyat, I got curious in an oil portrait displayed there and I asked my mom, "Sino yung taong nakasabit doon?"
6992 2018-10-15 15:01:07 St. I. Witkiewica, Teatr Maty
Charles-Édouard Pignon
Engraving and aquatint and etching, with oil tint and pasted silver print
6993 2018-10-15 15:01:05 Lol exactly. It does the same thing but to a different affiliation. It doesn't *observe* any hypocrisy, it *creates* it where none is given; there's no humor beyond that. It's a "here's a taste of your own medicine," and not a "I will demonstrate how this medicine is snake oil."
6994 2018-10-15 15:00:51 More like the Saudis threatened to completely eff up the price of oil.
6995 2018-10-15 15:00:50 Being oil dependent makes you a slave to the Saudis.

7002 2018-10-15 15:00:12 The conservatives should have been in India last year before they signed an oil deal with ADNOC in Feb. 2018, and have a stake in AbuDhabi's oilfield. Additionally how do you plan on shipping our crude if we can't get the PIPELINE built? PRIORITES are backwards. Optics not good.

7005 2018-10-15 15:00:07 Also please be clearer to your followers that the oil we “sell” (not Canada as a country, but private corps in our country sell) is not the same grade oil on the market as that selling at higher price

7012 2018-10-15 14:59:25 slightly different view i believe this is extending trend to 91 to 128 may be oil break below 70 will confirm ur trend then the short term count is right other wise it just extends to jan april

But dealing with anxiety and depression myself, I don’t do it some of my friends do and it helps them, I do vape occasionally CBD oil and it does relieve that pressure or feeling. But the first two points I agree

7025 2018-10-15 14:59:00 We actually do not get a very large amount of oil if any directly from the Saudis...that is mostly sold to the european markets and asia.....but irregardless we have a great deal of leverage over them geo politically speaking
7026 2018-10-15 14:58:49 Nice. Bolt the stable doors tight. The crude oil price like the proverbial horse has done a runner...

7029 2018-10-15 14:58:33 Well that's not true. That much a pub team why didn't you beat us ? Without a guy that is in the oil business your shite club would still be getting beat 8-0 off teams like Middlesbrough. Always remember that. You were nothing.
7030 2018-10-15 14:58:31 
7031 2018-10-15 14:58:30 They do have the Trump family by the family jewels. Can’t let Iran sell oil, divested US away from renewables, alienated EU allies, beholden to Saudi money ... disappointed not seeing much from EU, HRW, etc. Notice not a peep from Israel, Bibi has been bought long ago.

7033 2018-10-15 14:58:24 @vyasshruti 
It cannot be answered in 280 characters !
But its a very capital intensive industry and price sensitive in India. Years of profits were driven by low oil keeping costs low, not any more.

7035 2018-10-15 14:58:12 I know and it’s not even like there’s anything wrong with my car, she checked the computer and said it’s only gonna be an oil and filter check. Absolute jokers.
7036 2018-10-15 14:58:07 That's what he does. Sadly his supporters will say he never meant it even if it's on video. He's lied with the ease of a crooked oil salesman.
7037 2018-10-15 14:57:57 Best food I ever ate was street pizza in Florence mid - 70s. Tomatoes  bit oil, fab base
7038 2018-10-15 14:57:56 Too bad that Saddam Hussein was so psychologically unstable and heavy handed with his people. Saddam's Iraq would have made a much better regional stabilizer to keep the oil flowing and security tight. Might have exacerbated the Iran issue. Saudis were never cut out for the job.

7041 2018-10-15 14:57:44 not even fancy! only in Colombo  but this is like people "discovering" (and disproportionately exalting) mung ata/jakfruit/coconut oil, which I think we've already grumbled about together  I'm waiting for more fine-grained "discoveries" like SL vs. Indian curry powder.
7042 2018-10-15 14:57:42 olive oil night 1 
7043 2018-10-15 14:57:19 crude oil is not groundnut, it is a global commodity, anything that hits crude oil price on the Global stage MUST hit every economy in the world depending on it, instead of disgracing yourself further, mention one oil dependent economy that wasn't hit by crude shock?
7044 2018-10-15 14:57:13 I'm selling hugs. If you need one. .. I'm warm and caring compassionate and smell of YSL and beard oil...
7045 2018-10-15 14:56:59 What's a good long play for an oil price jump? I was looking at imo 2020 calls
7046 2018-10-15 14:56:53 I disagree, some of my tattoos healed the best with coconut oil. I would like to know why you think leaving it is best though? You know a tattoo heals exactly like a burn, & you wouldn’t leave a bad burn not moisturized.  Do you put sunscreen on your healed tatttoos?
7047 2018-10-15 14:56:47 I am negative about Trump supporters, mostly I feel sorry for the lot of them who are misguided in belief that Trump is their saviour not realizing he is selling snake oil.  Hostile should not be part of our beliefs for sheep following Trump supporters.
7048 2018-10-15 14:56:46 Then I sniff Peppermint oil. Cos Anxiety go enter.

7054 2018-10-15 14:56:22 Damn, I knew I should have picked the coconut oil instead of heavy whipping cream to mix with my coffee this morning.
7055 2018-10-15 14:56:13 @evanshalshawuk - Please advise Cardiff that CK11TBO will arrive between 0800 and 0930 on a recovery vehicle for urgent repair tomorrow. Oil Coolant Temperature alert on Saturday!! It seem impossible to speak to the garage when we need urgent help!!!
7056 2018-10-15 14:56:08 Never forget, big oil and weapons sales "Trump" the assassination of an American citizen.  What happened to being the moral leaders of the world.  "Rogue Killers"
7057 2018-10-15 14:56:05 Explain to me how a pipeline would refine our oil in Canada to sell at higher price by foreign companies ?
7058 2018-10-15 14:56:04 Why would they want to? Asking an honest question. What is the incentive for corrupt billionaire oil executives to change a culture that made them massively wealthy?

They're corrupt, bad people. Obviously "because it's the right thing to do" isn't an acceptable answer.
7059 2018-10-15 14:55:59 There is chaos every where! Dems are showing true colors. I remember when we we did not pay for 2 different translators in 1 classroom & paid teachers a decent wage! When oil fields employed blacks & whites now it is illegal aliens. Dems did away Rule of Law!
7060 2018-10-15 14:55:54 Could be but would rather him over some of what they currently have. As you know, was never a fan of the Aberg move & this could be the same deal.
7061 2018-10-15 14:55:53 Projection. It means non scientists / gop have a political agenda ... big oil and $’s.

7064 2018-10-15 14:55:37 It’s a good move. Please check out. Barter trade in oil ws practiced even between 2012-14. This has limitations as value of oil far outstrips of goods Iran can buy in barter from India. Over time huge rupee deposits accumulate for Iran in India n ultimately $ have to b paid out.

7067 2018-10-15 14:55:20 I always pay between $25-$35 for the oil change itself.
7068 2018-10-15 14:55:16 Doubt it. Nobody's got patience in oil country anymore. After the loss to Jersey, Oilersnation was imploding. Loss to Boston: Fans want everyone fired. Pretty sure the only instance where triumph is a thing is where the Oilers make the postseason.
7069 2018-10-15 14:55:14 Yeah, the old white men are coming for me. Trying to take my reproductive rights away. Trying to take my equal pay away and trying to kill me with big oil and gas. You really need to wake up trumper.

7075 2018-10-15 14:54:45 Beauty is in the skin! Take care of it, oil it, clean it, scrub it, perfume it, and put on your best clothes, even if there is no special occasion, and you'll feel like a queen. If society is hard on you, fight back by pampering your skin.

7079 2018-10-15 14:54:15 @MathieuBesson1 my colleague and I have been passing the time on flights to Chile by playing your great game but I’m having trouble cleaning up the dreaded oil spill... help! Andrew #geekchic #innovation
7080 2018-10-15 14:54:11 The biggest issue for me would be “opening up NNPC/Oil sector”. That is where Nigeria loses the most income.
7081 2018-10-15 14:54:10 Saudis treating US with 200$ oil and “The Kingdom emphasizes that it will respond to any measure against it with an even stronger measure. TheKingdom's economy has an influential and vital role in the global economy, and that Kingdom's economy is only affected by the global eco.”
7082 2018-10-15 14:54:08 I understand. My main reason for posting this article was that it was surprising to see anyone successfully challenge Big Oil. Seismic testing is not harmless
7083 2018-10-15 14:54:06 great impression of a person reading any given oil can tim tweet!
7084 2018-10-15 14:54:01 The fans wouldn't want him there anyway as they hate oil money apparently
7085 2018-10-15 14:53:59 My husband works in oil. Still fucked up. If they wanted to change the work culture, they easily could
7086 2018-10-15 14:53:52 USA ..ISRAEL..SAUDI ARABIA & GB 
ARE THE TERRORISTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST..  AND IT'S ALL FOR POWER OVER OIL.
7087 2018-10-15 14:53:45 On one hand you have 12 million starving and   on the other you have Saudi’s Oil .
7088 2018-10-15 14:53:44 If you don’t conform to every aspect of the party line...get out.
7089 2018-10-15 14:53:44 I need to go get an oil change 
7090 2018-10-15 14:53:39 Indian oil companies like IOC have optional volumes built in their annual crude oil purchase contracts with suppliers like Saudi Arabia and Iraq that will be more than enough to make up for any shortfall in supplies from sanctions-hit Iran

#Modinomics for you
7091 2018-10-15 14:53:38 Definitely, but in a "short-term" price spike you'd have basis diffs blow out too & quality diffs move as infrastructure isn't there. The heavy Canadian oil is important & it has no where else to go so US refiners can run lighter blends just at lower utilization/economics
7092 2018-10-15 14:53:36 For something slightly different, why don’t we talk about all the international oil brought to eastern Canada by ship and which Canadians benefit and how they benefit from our self limited infrastructure? Does Canada Steamship Lines have a significant volume of this?

7097 2018-10-15 14:53:26 We do both, however males affect either crop the same.  Seeded crops yield less cannabinoid oil.  THC and CBD are grown for extracts.
Growing seedless cannabis is easy on any scale, if you know your genetics, and what you are doing.

7101 2018-10-15 14:53:09 The oil for Mexico has sulfur in it and is very bad for the engine.
I don't know about Canadian Oil.
7102 2018-10-15 14:53:00 For decades the Saudis have been saying we are unable to use cutting oil production as a threat to prevent attacks on the House of Allah in Jerusalem (Masjid al-Aqsa), but yesterday, to protect their own house, suddenly they found a way to issue an oil-threat!?
7103 2018-10-15 14:52:55 In the little more than 100 years of commercial air travel, thousands of airlines have come and gone as casualties of oil prices, politics, mismanagement or financial loss #BreakingNews
7104 2018-10-15 14:52:48 Good thing Saudi have lots of oil to supply , or to cut supply.
7105 2018-10-15 14:52:45 @Tim_Walz sir, it would be nice to be able to vote for you, but before I do you need to withdraw your support (stated on your congressional page) for the keystone pipeline and for increased oil drilling at home, which are disgusting policy positions.

7114 2018-10-15 14:52:29 Nothing abnormal here. The idea is to encourage investors put money on risky ventures by allowing them to recoup their cost. As investment is stimulated the production is likely to shoot up and the nation shares in oil wealth steadily increases to 50% for 200K barrils output.

7133 2018-10-15 14:51:08 White rice and fried palm oil stew is so underrated 
7134 2018-10-15 14:51:05 In truth, a mature man who uses hair oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere.
7135 2018-10-15 14:50:58 Then why is the U.S. pushing for oil pipelines from Canada? Why are they seeking our dirty oil?  We should all move beyond fossil fuels, but, sadly, economies are currently based on thoses fuel sources. Almost all of 20th C history is about oil.

7140 2018-10-15 14:50:41 This is nonsense. The oil industry is also heavily subsidized. How would you classify the Federal Gov't buying a pipeline as anything other than a publicly funded subsidy? Also, the consumption of whale oil as fuel grew unabated until we moved past that unsustainable industry...

7144 2018-10-15 14:50:23 Don't recall but they don't have one so there isnt a point in setting up the PP as if they do. Teams can still have a good PP without a bomb from the point. IMO, the keys for the man at the point is finding the open guy & getting pucks through to the net. Heavy shot not necessary

7160 2018-10-15 14:49:00 An ex-lawmaker leaving a party matters as much as an ex baseball player rooting for a new team
7161 2018-10-15 14:48:46 Thought he already left?
7162 2018-10-15 14:48:40 And the oil?
7163 2018-10-15 14:48:38 Russia has a surplus of oil Rita, so perhaps not.
7164 2018-10-15 14:48:33 but companies have a great concern about their liability if trace elements of terrorist oil or cartel oil finds their way into the pipelines or refineries of American companies. Lots of potential issues moving forward for the industry and not many solutions yet.
7165 2018-10-15 14:48:31 ships are louder, spill oil etc... propellers harm. you can be quite close to turbines in ground ones... there isn't a vibration or loud noises either.
7166 2018-10-15 14:48:30 dude idk but coconut oil it's my answer to everything maybe it can help?
7167 2018-10-15 14:48:24 I don't blame the Edmonton police for this policy. I work for a major oil company and their policy is to reflect what the police (city and RCMP) policies are. The legal consequences for marijuana use are going to be more strict than before due to new regulations.
7168 2018-10-15 14:48:12 I use passion fruit oil, hemp oil and coconut oil.
7169 2018-10-15 14:48:04 Wahh really? Tapi memang best pun sbb Senka punya oil cleanser has a nice smell and feels so soft
7170 2018-10-15 14:47:56 That's probably not gun powder, it's more like an oil, and maybe residue mixed in.  Alcohol wipe will be fine.  GP won't hurt though.
Glad to hear your news, now practice, practice, practice.
My 14 yr old grandson had same problem, only w/ one of my 9mm.  Not now.
7171 2018-10-15 14:47:50 Our oil producers will raise their prices too.

7174 2018-10-15 14:47:40 No. Saudies are using a tone of threat because of their oil assets. They are behind the ISIS and AlQaida and many other terrorist organisation. They funded 9/11, AlQaida and ISIS and it's time to teach them the lesson that people can't forget easily. @FoxNews @CIA
7175 2018-10-15 14:47:36 Actually the old guard is Hillary and the rest of us.  The good old boys are big oil, etc
7176 2018-10-15 14:47:36 It was done initially by the US Military with ConocoPhillips in Iraq to track oil shipments because the differences in refineries was stark enough to see what was coming from where doing The Surge timeframe in 2006-2008. Today it is being more widely used...
7177 2018-10-15 14:47:23 You forgot our 20 dollar a barrel oil that we can't get to market for 70
7178 2018-10-15 14:47:14 Starting 4th November 2018, India will send rice to Iran in the exchange of crude oil. With this modern form of the old fashioned barter system, our dependence on the American dollar will be less and our Indian rupee will get a new life. Modi magic transforming India!

#Crude_Quality_Matters
7183 2018-10-15 14:47:00 Interesting factoid, that applies to the UK and Alberta. When oil royalties are increased, the government gets LOWER royalty revenues in succeeding years. 

When they REDUCE royalties, the governments get MORE royalty revenue.
7184 2018-10-15 14:46:47 คำว่าน่ารักเต็มไปหมดด
7185 2018-10-15 14:46:45 Thats the power of money ...
Iam going to say this again: the "green" industry its fucking our planet 300% more fast than before ... the extraction of OIL and MINERAL materials have increased 300% since this new industry started working ..
7186 2018-10-15 14:46:43 Carbon based? Resource based? 
Oil is finite

I was told that economy will always be put before ecology until the value of a human life is clearly defined.

How much is clean air worth?

How much is clean water worth?
-Oceans? Fish? 

How much is their value on the balance sheet?

7194 2018-10-15 14:46:03 Oil Money though init.
7195 2018-10-15 14:45:52 Saudi can easily push oil upto $200 no one else has the spare capacity if Saudi stops pumping oil. Trump loses midterms big with expensive oil.
7196 2018-10-15 14:45:52 Yeah but thank CHRIST they don't have oil, or we would have had to do something about this grotesque and unacceptable contravention of the  Geneva Convention eh @InstituteGC ?
7197 2018-10-15 14:45:52 Looks like we all gonna be calling Shk Mohammed bin Salman “Prince bin Salman” which is further proof that journalists covering about the Middle East are barely informed cretins.

7215 2018-10-15 14:44:33 Trump has coddled dictators, but labeled Canada a threat to US national security. Saudi Arabia threatens $400/barrel #oil prices over #Khashoggi torture and murder, and the country that we import the most oil from is...Canada.

7226 2018-10-15 14:43:40 I see this as an area where the broken contracts will eventually work themselves out, just like the word, "snake oil salesman" became a warning to others.

So in a way, it does help enforce contracts... no one wants to be the "snake oil salesman".
7227 2018-10-15 14:43:39 I agree whole heartedly- my family thrives from Texas oil and liberals tell me all the time that we should join them but when I say put on your steel toes and  join us, they become vile creatures.
7228 2018-10-15 14:43:34 Pizza and pasta are NOT fattening...it's what it goes with them that makes people gaining weight. Mozzarella is quite full of fats, so it should be scattered and not overload the pizza. Tomato sauce (and I mean 'passata' NO ketchup) with olive oil and basil are healty ingedients

7233 2018-10-15 14:43:19 Do you mean Canadian oil ? (I am Canadian).  I agree, the Tar Sands oil needs to stay in the ground. I am not an oul advocate.
7234 2018-10-15 14:43:16 Between that and using her kid to help her sell her snake oil shit, I'm out.

7236 2018-10-15 14:43:14 “Rogue killers” just hangin’ out at the embassy.

His supports buy this crap like snake oil.
7237 2018-10-15 14:42:59 And dont get me started on how stupid it is to put all your eggs in one basket with oil.
When it does run out, who are they going to blame and cry to then?
7238 2018-10-15 14:42:58 $NIO   >8.35 = 10 +  if oil ever did go to 100-200 ( or double that ) $NIO $TSLA quadruple to start... no one will ever use oil again.. = good put the middle-east out of bizz is OK w/ME! 
7239 2018-10-15 14:42:45 The King is not telling the truth. And his OIL is out priced.
Tired of paying so much for fuel.
7240 2018-10-15 14:42:39 After my astounding success with the DIY makeup brush cleaner, I have decided to give another Pinterest experiment a go. 

This time it’s adding salt to my shampoo. Supposed to quell over production of oil and add volume. So far so good. Stay tuned.
7241 2018-10-15 14:42:33 Try reading it. Most of the so called subsidies are in the form of tax breaks, allowed every other companies. For instance, there is reduced VAT on gasoline and natural gas. But also for wind and solar power. 

The UK oil and gas pays the highest effective taxes in the UK

7246 2018-10-15 14:42:04 Think it's because no oil reserves have been found in Yemen Ronnie, so the major world powers aren't bothered about intervening and obviously taking charge of the reserves!
7247 2018-10-15 14:41:57 Tender care, atau pake olive oil sih
7248 2018-10-15 14:41:53 can't be right - I think total oil production in country is around 100k barrels

7259 2018-10-15 14:41:16 According to our government, 15 out of the 19 attackers on 911 were Saudi citizens. But because they sell us lots of oil, we invaded Iraq.
7260 2018-10-15 14:41:16 I wondered if you were going to say oil after the fried chicken comment. I love that color and wish it would look good on me.
7261 2018-10-15 14:41:09 " What happened under d PDP'a regime of oil subsidy  was a scam! They were paying for products that did not land and all PDP's bigwigs were involved . You could recollect d former PDP's chairman's son was arraigned & many of them are refunding d money they stole..."

7262 2018-10-15 14:41:03 The world is funny, if the government finds diamonds or oil in your backyard, it's government property. But if they find drugs, it's yours. 
7263 2018-10-15 14:40:58 They really played very well I even thought maybe someone promised them cooking oil if they won
7264 2018-10-15 14:40:52 And snake oil salesmen don't
7265 2018-10-15 14:40:52 Lets go natural and save ladies.... imagine how many cooking oil bottles you would stock up with just one weave?

7267 2018-10-15 14:40:46 OK, let him to investigate. You work for control achievement of oil market. Made rules on Middle East, Russia and China through oil prices, they are dependent. I'm ready to consult.

7278 2018-10-15 14:39:47 Will the US stopp selling weapon systems to them ? Will the US stop buying oil from them ??? Thought so...
7279 2018-10-15 14:39:42 Appropriating the struggle of a minority class while you bathe in the benefits of your whiteness is the most shameful kind of identity theft. On par with the snake oil salesman.

That's how the oil business works
7291 2018-10-15 14:38:35 Removing love from the Scriptures leaves you with rules and regulations to follow which leads to legalism. Remove love from your walk with God and you get a performance. Love is the oil that keeps our relational and spiritual engines running.

7293 2018-10-15 14:38:33 A lot of wealtjy oil and gas barons are going to lose their shirts when we elect a governor who will keep it in the ground. But that governor will be working for the people and the planet. Vote Jay Gonzalez into office soche can get the job done.

7299 2018-10-15 14:37:47 OIL 1H puts in double bottom & confirms above 70.66 critical support to hold charts 5 waves up integrity. WATCH UWT ?
7300 2018-10-15 14:37:38 hii ni hatari saaaana. hope its contained soon although its very hard for the oil tanks to be reached by the fire.
7301 2018-10-15 14:37:36 That has nothing to do with TMX. And Alberta oil would not get a higher price in Asia. If that was possible oil from existing KM pipe would be going there. It’s not.
7302 2018-10-15 14:37:27 If Oil is draining so much money from treasury then why we r not switching to alternative fuel based vehicle? our Auto Industry lacking necessary technology??
7303 2018-10-15 14:37:18 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
7304 2018-10-15 14:37:16 Probs used to have some lard to make it ‘shorter’ - palm and rapeseed oil seem to be the ubiquitous fats appearing everywhere making our country’s baking one dimensional and homogeneous. Shame.
7305 2018-10-15 14:37:15 and yet the government  conveniently remember Al Maharah to use it as a leverage when negotiating with the Saudis regarding the oil pipeline  which they intend to lay

7312 2018-10-15 14:36:40 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
7313 2018-10-15 14:36:36 What are we doing about our refineries? Why don't we have modular refineries yet in the Niger delta? Each oil producing state should have @ least 3 modular refineries and @ least 4 mobile gas turbines for power.
7314 2018-10-15 14:36:34 ....
7315 2018-10-15 14:36:25 We need that pipeline. We must find other markets for our oil other than the United States. Donald Trump’s presidency has proven this to be true more so now than ever before.
7316 2018-10-15 14:36:24 I don’t have those numbers on the spot market. I believe that varies on how much oil is hedged by the producers at a given time. It may also be impacted by differences between how much oil is being shipped beyond what has been contracted to be shipped by producers.
7317 2018-10-15 14:36:20 Don’t lie they are still selling oil .they are still trading with the US .check the facts
7318 2018-10-15 14:35:51 No doubt they have been bribed by the oil lobbys.
7319 2018-10-15 14:35:49 Had to pay my phone bill, my car insurance & get my oil changed today uhhhh man whack
7320 2018-10-15 14:35:49 And yet they keep saying they can’t afford our health and safety and keep fighting the Martinez case.  It’s amazing what oil and gas can afford.
7321 2018-10-15 14:35:39 And of course the Austrian government makes a lot of money from the "mineral oil tax" as we call it. They would hate to lose that because they need it to spend on some nonsense or another.

7336 2018-10-15 14:34:14 Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province plans on listing up to 25% of shares in the provincial oil and gas company (KPOGCL) at the Pakistan Stock Exchange. KPOGCL forecasts oil and gas production in the province to double by 2025, reaching 200,000 BPD (oil) and 2 BCFD (gas).
7337 2018-10-15 14:34:08 We already have Socialism: Medicare, Social Security, the Military, tax breaks for billionaires, the bailout of Wall Street, the fixing of drug prices by Bush, billions to the oil industry and defense contractors, airports, roads, professional sports, and on and on.

7339 2018-10-15 14:34:03 PM reportedly urges global oil suppliers to review payment terms in order to give relief to the weak rupee. Meanwhile, India's trade deficit shrank in September to its lowest level in 5 months at $13.98 billion
7340 2018-10-15 14:33:54 But big gap in our delivery on oil and gas exploration over decades. Combination of govt apathy, lack of vision and likely hidden interests of political cuts on oil & gas buys. 2/2
7341 2018-10-15 14:33:52 Would anyone successfully corner USA, now that USA is the leading producer of oil and natural gas?
7342 2018-10-15 14:33:46 Saudis have had you by the balls for decades. 
1. Install a Russian base

4. Stop buying US weapons

Economy would crash..

7348 2018-10-15 14:33:25 There is not a correlation between October and the stock market, but there is one between stock market and interest rates, tariffs, US v Saudi Arabia with respect to oil prices.  All the things that Trump says and does thus far has negatively affected the stock market
7349 2018-10-15 14:33:23 @IcelandFoods are doing such a great job with their no bull range & improving accessibility to veganism, but if they could work on completely removing plastic from their packaging, just as they've removed palm oil they'd be the true environmental saviours.

7357 2018-10-15 14:32:33 Oil, I think, is the word you're looking for. 

If you want to understand American politics race and oil are just about all you have to know.
7358 2018-10-15 14:32:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
7359 2018-10-15 14:32:27 I just can’t forget 9/11 and a Regime that cultivated hate and murder against their own teaching... and yet OIL and business is more important than people.
7360 2018-10-15 14:32:23 Dear Consumer, supply interrupted due to oil leakage so supply will resume approx 30 min
7361 2018-10-15 14:32:20 制圧を取るのもありですね。端攻城の場合は中武力あたりが釣れればいいなぁでやったりしますね
7362 2018-10-15 14:32:18 He might need the Tin Man in his corner with a oil drum to get rid of the ring rust.  He wasn't getting the height on his kicks.  Maybe some DDP Yoga would increase his flexibility.
7363 2018-10-15 14:32:12 BTW, I would have loved to chuck my old oil burner in the Skip, but it was too expensive. Maybe someday
7364 2018-10-15 14:32:09 ขอโทษนะร่างกาย
7365 2018-10-15 14:32:09 Confused.  Other than oil and 9-11 hijackers, what does "the kingdom" export?
7366 2018-10-15 14:32:05 The cost of food in Iran has nothing to do with POTUS .what are the Iranian Government Doing With Oil revenues ?

7370 2018-10-15 14:31:41 @CostaCoffee could you please tell me if the palm oil used in your products is ethical and RSPO certified?? @RSPOtweets . If not then you should probably immediately educate yourself and change this  #sustainablepalmoil #palmoil
7371 2018-10-15 14:31:38 Palm oil obviously. I love Nature. (Also the only good Mars is an ice cream Mars which is unaccountably delicious)

7373 2018-10-15 14:31:35 Saudi state propaganda threatening oil price spike >$100 if there are sanctions related to #Kashoggi murder. @SquawkCNBC talking heads ‘well thats going to massively accelerate EV adoption, TSLA may even be a buy (laughs) -@jimcramer.  It’s a nothing burger.
7374 2018-10-15 14:31:30 Bob Dudley of @BP_plc to CNBC-TV18: See Oil Prices Around $60-65/bbl Over Time, Not Immediately; Electric Vehicles Are Not Going To Change Oil Demand Overnight @cnbcipr #CrudeOil #CERAWeek @KilduffReport #OPEC
7375 2018-10-15 14:31:25 I will forever shop at @Kmart & @Sears No matter what happens. I’ll never forget all the childhood memories at these stores, getting in the car with Mom, shopping back to school at Kmart, mowing the lawn with a new Craftsman mower, getting the oil change, thank you for it all
7376 2018-10-15 14:31:22 In addition to marrying you  he proves he is one smart hombre! Oil is at the top of the list but is competing for Trumps love of money. Damn I wish that fat orange cheetoh face fool would magically disappear from the planet with all his minions, admin, etc. 
7377 2018-10-15 14:31:21 We usually try to wait till snow flies. Otherwise it's a very very long winter running on oil only. If you are lucky you have a stove or fireplace to augment
7378 2018-10-15 14:31:17 Saudi report threatens Trump over #JamalKhashoggi

1. Install a Russian base
2. Take oil to $200
3. Kill the petro dollar
4. Stop buying US weapons

US will "stab its own economy to death"...so...bend over US and continue the pounding.

7380 2018-10-15 14:30:43 When it is time you will know that those companies are actually run from the proceeds of some oil wells he controls.  For now enjoy the tales by moonlight.

7385 2018-10-15 14:30:01 "Thanks" to the Kashoggi affair, the dollar oil price is up again. What if the entire story is a setup, both sides acting in a staged drama? -- when markets can be moved big time and big money can be made, anything is possible
7386 2018-10-15 14:29:54 He’s setting up the narrative & cover-up for the Saudis ... ‘ROGUE KILLERS’ I don’t understand how anyone can support this self centered TRAITOR! It’s a strategic business move to keep this personal relationship with their oil and money!
7387 2018-10-15 14:29:53 明日休み貰えた増加〜
7388 2018-10-15 14:29:47 I agree...sell they the military hardware they ordered and then cut all ties with them.  We don't need their stinking oil...we have our own!  Saudia Arabia has never been a friend of ours.
7389 2018-10-15 14:29:46 Aye, and we get to keep all we earn, and the oil reserves too. The shame of a Union with England that effectively impoverishes us economically and politically.
7390 2018-10-15 14:29:37 ぎがの君明日暇なんか？
7391 2018-10-15 14:29:36 The oil industry will go the way of the coal industry.
We should be setting up hydrogen plants and infrastructure or technology will move on and we're going to be left behind.
7392 2018-10-15 14:29:25 Ehn? I know of just vegetable oil
7393 2018-10-15 14:29:22 Vegetable oil and water... Sometime with milk
7394 2018-10-15 14:29:12 Happy to announce that I will be advising $PCC @PetrolConnect Please send contributions as bags of oil labeled "ETH" to Venezuela #Bitcoin #Crypto #cryptocurrency #blockchain
7395 2018-10-15 14:29:10 Ok, great. Saudi Arabia gets invaded by space aliens and all of their oil is extracted by giant UFO tankers, which is then poured onto the planet like gravy and then lit aflame to kill all humans. Under that scenario, Brent will exceed $400. Agreed?
7396 2018-10-15 14:29:07 それは困るわ
7397 2018-10-15 14:29:04 Some would say that our presence in the Middle East is motivated by oil.  It's even rumored that the purpose of the Gulf War was to take control of refineries.
7398 2018-10-15 14:29:03 @NestleUSA FFS stop polluting the planet with oil plastic !! And it raises the climate warming too...
7399 2018-10-15 14:29:01 And surely you don’t want to be like the one of those oil clubs, winning trophies, investing in the team, bringing in world class players, come on wheres the fun in all of that
7400 2018-10-15 14:28:59 ALL #science junk to DT for oil $ coal.  The crime is in convincing the climate victims, ALL our KIDS/grand who're NOT billionaires- that SCIENCE is "JUNK".  Leading US to hell.  They're KILLING our kid's future with emissions (NO #SOLAR!!). 
Btw, DNA done by a brilliant expert..

7406 2018-10-15 14:28:15 The person who'd like to deny freedom of choice with regards to abortion is lecturing about folks being allowed to think for themselves. Next up you'll advocate putting a fire out with oil because your religion groupthink demands it. You facile little sockpuppet.
7407 2018-10-15 14:28:09 My mom used to soak Cotten balls in peppermint oil and put them where we had mice and spiders! It really does work!!
7408 2018-10-15 14:28:02 I swear I always need a oil change

7417 2018-10-15 14:27:08 Well, having the largest oil reserves in the world (and extraction costs of shale coming down - environmental being ignored by current admin) is that the effects of supply and demand would mean spikes in price would be moderated by rapid increase in production.
7418 2018-10-15 14:27:05 Ah ah you people have become detectives. It's sad the US won't sanction them though. Oil speaks
7419 2018-10-15 14:27:04 うさぎにゃんこに食われちまうだよ
7420 2018-10-15 14:26:57 Too bad Trump doesn’t have a friendly country willing to sell oil with no strings attached.. oh wait, Canada!

7424 2018-10-15 14:26:40 They do not have complete control of oil prices. US and Russia have become #1 and #2 pil producing countries and most of the world are foing towards EV, the electrification movement. Call their bluff and Sanction them.

7429 2018-10-15 14:26:24 The Saudis will definitely not want to want to get involved with Russia , or China for that matter. I'd rather buy oil , if we must have the damn stuff , from Venezuela . At some point a country that lays claim to being " Civilised" must stand against "Un - Civilised" behaviour.
7430 2018-10-15 14:26:16 Trump doesn’t give damn about his disappearance which he killed by order of Saudi and all these caring acts are to blackmail Saudi to keep oil price low while Trump stupid withdraw Iran deal which will cause us higher oil prices and instability in reagent just please Israel 
7431 2018-10-15 14:26:00 @jasonmyrt no one wants your trash. Ant trashed him but now foles is an asset? Snake oil salesman. When your stuck being local you dont know what outside ppl see or know. We know foles is done. Sad Ant doesnt know everyone else knows that also.
7432 2018-10-15 14:25:56 You can still get the olive oil soap here in the Sharjah souq, BTW. Only Nablus beats that...
7433 2018-10-15 14:25:50 They are counting on peak Lithium and realized that it would peak before oil does 
7434 2018-10-15 14:25:49 The UN wouldn’t allow it they are in the Muslims pocket so to speak. Bought and paid for by the oil money. The Chinese have the right idea don’t allow them to destroy their culture and history
7435 2018-10-15 14:25:45 Blame big oil not us.
7436 2018-10-15 14:25:17 Milo is made of malted barley, solid milk, sugar, cocoa & vegetable oil. No me gusta.
7437 2018-10-15 14:25:13 I just want some Italian food. Calamari and some kind of fragrant bread with lots of olive oil, chicken and prawn penne in mushroom sauce with lots of parmesan and tiramisu, gelato or both to finish it off.
7438 2018-10-15 14:25:11 @Paul_engytrd If oil just dies around 71 - 72 into Wednesday close it will be perfect.

7440 2018-10-15 14:25:07 Most of those oil "subsidies" are tax breaks allowed all companies. 

In the US, Canada and the UK, oil and gas companies pay the highest effective tax rates. If you pay the highest rates, you are not really being subsidized.

Next?
7441 2018-10-15 14:25:00 Congress brought Pvt Insurance , loss to LIC
Congress brought Pvt banks , loss to SBI & PSU banks
Congress brought RIL, loss to IOC ,ONGC ,BP, HP
Were these institution of Pakistan or China so Congress brought private companies into insurance ,banking & oil? Answer @RahulGandhi
7442 2018-10-15 14:24:59 That would be a double benefit. Not arming their atrocities and not burning their oil. Result.
7443 2018-10-15 14:24:56 It's very disturbing to note that the majority of Zimbabweans get their salaries in bond notes but are expected to buy basic commodities (cooking oil and medicines) in US$.

7447 2018-10-15 14:24:24 Trump pact with Saudis will push oil down
7448 2018-10-15 14:24:23 Cruise ships & airplanes pollute more than all of our cars. Also the nuclear power plants in japan are still leaking radiation into the ocean. So why is this a political issue? We could run cars off of hydrogen but the oil companies own the republicans and Democrats. Tweet that!
7449 2018-10-15 14:24:06 Chop one hundred pounds of olive oil then allow to simmer.
7450 2018-10-15 14:24:00 "Enviro extremists". You mean people who realize that Alberta won't have oil and other natural resources left in about 30 years and are demanding something be done NOW? You mean those people?
7451 2018-10-15 14:23:42 It would also help ALL high cost oil producers, right?

7467 2018-10-15 14:22:08 Nope. This is a Trump thing. Not an oil thing. Not a national security thing. Not an “independent of presidencies” thing. There’s a financial hook here somewhere. Maybe if we looked at Trump’s taxes? Or Jared’s loans ?
7468 2018-10-15 14:22:06 Because Mars uses palm oil or because they’re rubbish?
7469 2018-10-15 14:22:05 He's delusional, anything to keep the Saudi's happy as they have their hands on the Oil valve.

7482 2018-10-15 14:20:32 Current events could lead to another oil embargo by Saudi Arabia, and it could be 1973 all over again
7483 2018-10-15 14:20:32 kak pah pernah personally try tamanu oil takk
7484 2018-10-15 14:20:25 @realDonaldTrump Erdogan was placed by Alice ... he is an actor placed. We must use our own oil and get out of the wonderland created. We have enough here in USA. Trust nothing that bad actor says... he killed off all the Christians in Turkey. The reporter is a TRICK!
7485 2018-10-15 14:20:20 Maybe for head rights--go ahead and look that up Trump train and then get back to us. SHE said and was CORRECT that she has Indian hertiage,she never claimed she wanted oil well revenue. But...keep kissing Trumps ass,your about the last one.
7486 2018-10-15 14:20:17 สั่งบั้มไอค่อนเเล้วมันมาถึงพน.เอ่อออออ กูโดนเเม่ทุบเเน่ๆ
7487 2018-10-15 14:20:16 Very interesting analysis. Are there some notes somewhere on how to do this? Btw i was looking at oil import volume for 2013 2014, they were quite weak for the large EM oil importers. Maybe high oil price and weak EM currencies will have similar impact this time
7488 2018-10-15 14:20:13 Yes, USA took over our role, but our connection has always remained. We just sell them guns and planes now, and allow their oil money investments into this country and in the West.
7489 2018-10-15 14:20:09 Certainty. Those who voted for trump in 2016 are forgiven.  They were fooled by a snake oil salesman..nothing new there. However, those who support Trump still are very likely immoral and un-American individuals.  It's as simple as that.

Will you take away the right of deciding oil price ,from oil companies, when u get in to power?
And he will not answer.

7498 2018-10-15 14:18:47 At 2AM when all the lights are off and stray kids are trying to get some sleep-
Jisung: if vegetable oil is made from vegetables, coconut oil is made from Coconuts. Then baby oil-
Seungmin: Someone cut hIS FUCKING VOCAL CORDS.
7499 2018-10-15 14:18:46 I’m hoping it’s the oil used to prevent cradle cap 
7500 2018-10-15 14:18:45 When the mine cutting machine operators follow the bottle of oil, it is because they think tissue box will be thrown into the control room.
7501 2018-10-15 14:18:15 Vegetable oil, milk and water

7505 2018-10-15 14:17:56 walking towards a zombie, I play dead and observe an oil rig erupt across town
7506 2018-10-15 14:17:50 Sorry, let me clarify. I’m not saying they only care about oil companies, I’m saying they care about oil companies disproportionately.
7507 2018-10-15 14:17:47 Oil shrugging off Saudi threat--which would disproportionately impact it's Asian customers and galvanize EV demand destruction as well as unleashing shale
7508 2018-10-15 14:17:43 One of the most daunting tasks for Sri Lanka today is to reduce the external trade deficit. However, it must be emphasised that volatility in global crude oil prices can add to the deficit further. Finally, we should ensure that imports through informal channels are discouraged
7509 2018-10-15 14:17:40 I like the oil changes when I don’t have to get out the car 
7510 2018-10-15 14:17:32 This!!! I actually expect men to NOT rape, to NOT beat up their families, to NOT sexually harass women, to NOT indulge in mass shootings, to NOT be serial killers, to NOT start pointless wars over oil and pride. I think I have a higher opinion of men than many men do. 
7511 2018-10-15 14:17:31 And.........we still don’t have the oil.............
7512 2018-10-15 14:17:27 Fracking has enabled the United States to be a truly competitive producer of crude oil.
7513 2018-10-15 14:17:23 Your overconfidence was your undoing :(
7514 2018-10-15 14:17:17 I hope that Trump doesn't go with idea of it was rogue killers that murdered the journalist. Obviously that is a load of crap. Hope Trump doesn't give Saudi Arabia a free pass because of oil and military contracts

You are so jealous of rich people, even those who mary their 8 year old sisters, that you'll condone murder for a piece of pie. You are currently going on tv and washing their feet like any good shine boy.

Petrol prices have soared despite the reduction in crude oil prices compared to the Manmohan government. Ache din....

7539 2018-10-15 14:15:35  Good morning traders!

 This week should be a good one for trades. We have signals on #oil and the $audusd  and many are in the process of being created as we speak. This fourth quarter should be a good one!

7540 2018-10-15 14:15:35 It's never a good time with Saudis but you got to have oil man 
7541 2018-10-15 14:15:34 He was laughing when the oil prices were very low. Now he has lost control when the oil price jumped to $80. What will happen if oil price touches $100. Our PM will quit. Only jumla sarkar and no hold on economy.
7542 2018-10-15 14:15:29 The fear of losing a high paying oil job is REAL so there will be a negative reaction.  The oil industry, and all the careers that are associated with it, will suffer.  Their concerns are justified.... retraining is not easy, different job not easy either
7543 2018-10-15 14:15:28 Dropped Pheebs off at school, went to bank to pay my car, went to change my oil and ordered groceries for pick up before 9:30am. Who am I?

7545 2018-10-15 14:15:12 Sorry, but your premise is flawed. SA is not a ‘necessary’ partner. All they have to offer is oil and sand, but that is just a customer/vendor relationship. I buy things at Wal-Mart, but that, a partnership, does not make.
7546 2018-10-15 14:15:11 I went to buy groceries and couldn't find a decent deal on olive oil

Mother treats her baby whole!
Oil massage, save from winter-heat, save from falling, teach to walk, etc. do very carefully!
But if she look or read well even during pregnancy, then the child will become more healthy and character full, that too for a lifetime!
7548 2018-10-15 14:14:48 It’s more interesting to think that Europe wanted us as a partner while we had significant North Sea oil and a financial bonus from it.  Now that our North Sea oil output is down by what 80% they don’t seem to be interested in catering to our wishes. They’ve had the best from us.

7554 2018-10-15 14:14:18 This is why you’re right about geoengineering! But I think people who say socialism is required to fix climate change are mostly imagining a mandatory shift to renewables that big oil wouldn’t ever allow.

7559 2018-10-15 14:13:48 Saudi Arabia should have been held responsible long time before for the things they have done. That this has happened is partly because the world let them think they could get away with anything so long as the thirst for oil outweighed everything else

7561 2018-10-15 14:13:43 China is Malaysia’s largest palm oil consumer. “Arowana Oil” holds 40% of China’s market share (1.4B population!). Owner of Arowana Oil is.... Robert Kuok.

7568 2018-10-15 14:13:04 Sure, but (a) big oil has a kind of extensive lobbying network that Apple could develop but has not and (b) don’t you think “let’s shut down Apple” would be a complete nonstarter?
7569 2018-10-15 14:13:00 That oil is trading lower here is really interesting given the backdrop.

7581 2018-10-15 14:12:24 Soo no one was gonna tell me that oil is the devil ?  I was fucked up fucked up @TennStateQues
7582 2018-10-15 14:12:18 You compare Nigeria with UK. litre of oil in Nigeria is less than 30P and in UK is more than £1.
We MUST do things right in Nigeria to be able to get it right.
NIGERIA MUST NOT FAIL OR DIE!
7583 2018-10-15 14:12:16 As long as you keep getting that oil you dont care who the Saudis hack to death. Americans do care about this..

7590 2018-10-15 14:11:30 @JavierBlas Oil would have to be above $10 per gallon of gasoline to get more people to buy a Telsa.

Currently only  about $2.80

7592 2018-10-15 14:11:26 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
7593 2018-10-15 14:11:25 They will have less oil revenue from us which is why they own UST in first place (they have to own foreign assets cuz they can’t own domestic ones.  They will slowly reduce buying and betin selling

7595 2018-10-15 14:11:17 Why wouldn’t China buy Iranian oil at a discount instead of buying it from Saudi Arabia?
7596 2018-10-15 14:11:16 Please tell me how you think Iran is sponsoring terrorism.  Iran is the country that has executed the most members of ISIS.  Iran sided with Assad in Syria because the US started a war there so the could build an oil and gas pipeline through it, and Iran thought it unfair.
7597 2018-10-15 14:11:12 There is no Saudi side of the story. You just hired cleaning ladies  to remove all signs of murder. Look what you to the World Trade Center, in 911, nearly 3000 people were murdered by 15 paid government Saudi’s. Look what you are doing to Yamenis. Your f@cking oil is not enough.
7598 2018-10-15 14:11:07 Yes, you are right the impact is not significant when it comes to #China & #India. The negative effect of the #Saudi #oil-supply shock on the global economy is overall not that large (0.7% annualized for the US), but the negative effect on the Saudi economy itself is quite large.
7599 2018-10-15 14:11:03 US imposed sanctions against countries buying oil or doing business with Iran goes into effect November 4th and Saudi Arabia sanctions may have an impact on oil supply and prices which could cause the cost of goods to rise.

When I worked in the petrol industry, guys would brag about how many hours they worked, or how long it had been since they last saw their families. They LIKED being used.

7614 2018-10-15 14:09:58 Maybe they should take all that dirty money, invest it into making electro cars affordable for everyone, and make us less dependent on Saudi oil. This dependency is crippling us morally.
7615 2018-10-15 14:09:56 I don’t see why everyone is soooo surprised that MBS & the Saudi Government “may have” killed Khashoggi on diplomatic soil in Turkey. SA has had blood on its hands for YEARS (think 9/11). The US and Allies chose to ignore this because of oil & $$$. Plain & simple.

7621 2018-10-15 14:09:23 Why do we EXPORT so much of our oil when the Saudis are continuing to dominate the oil market? Something's wrong here. #oilprice
7622 2018-10-15 14:09:06 Olive oil is great for cooking but not so much for seasoning, it has a low smoke temperature relative to canola oil-think you’ll be happier.
7623 2018-10-15 14:09:06 Right, but the gas tax gets passed on to consumers without meaningfully affecting the profits passed on to oil executives. Turning the oil off (which I think is what people envision here) would stop the profits.

7627 2018-10-15 14:08:56 .... When someone like that starts playing games with oil, it will inevitably end up messy in one way or another...

Its almost as if nothing out of that region is well thought through or at the least they have no consideration for potential consequences... I give up...
7628 2018-10-15 14:08:41 The oil saga is just an example of citizen power.  We have other options.
7629 2018-10-15 14:08:40 Did I hear right, that trump demanded Saudi Arabia flood the market with oil to keep prices down, in which they rejected.
7630 2018-10-15 14:08:40 The graph shows oil demand *growth* not oil demand.
7631 2018-10-15 14:08:35 This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one with even half a brain. @realDonaldTrump is a self-absorbed megalomaniac moron! The man is nothing but a snake oil salesman. #Trump_is_a_Lying_Machine #Trump_is_an_Idiot #Trump_is_Clueless #Trump_is_an_Embarrassment

7635 2018-10-15 14:08:24 Definitely paying in Rupee is only option then. US will not provide any more waiver to us after S400 deal which has pissed Trump administration. India though has decreased its dependency on Iranian oil but still it will affect Oil prices
7636 2018-10-15 14:08:22 Saudi threatens to use oil as a weapon and..OIL IS DOWN TODAY.
 What does that tell you.

I wouldn't want to be long oil here.
7637 2018-10-15 14:08:01 On the morbid side of life..

7639 2018-10-15 14:07:41 I’d like a hydrogen fueled vehicle, of course everyone would bitch we are consuming the oceans water . Lol To bad big oil bought all the patents and shelved them years ago from what I read. Of course that could be fake news.
7640 2018-10-15 14:07:38 If global warming doesn’t sway you toward renewable energy, what’s happening with Saudi Arabia definitely should. I’m sick of the world being held hostage by this oppressive regime just because they happen to be in the right geographical place to have access to oil.

7642 2018-10-15 14:07:33 We’re already doing this. Tagging molecules to track cartel oil siphoned from specific PEMEX refineries and pipelines, then finding those molecules in Texas markets. Blockchain tech will try to remedy this but we’re definitely already identifying and distinguishing molecules.

7644 2018-10-15 14:07:29 More news of @DNC failure. Remember the #keystone pipeline @BarackObama and his leftists kept fighting? The lack of it kept us dependent on #Saudi oil. Now the possible killing of a journalist by their agents and our retaliation are...1/

7646 2018-10-15 14:07:23 Delusions in oil
7647 2018-10-15 14:07:18 It all boils down to the fact we got oil for a cheap price, so Saudi is great and wonderful. When the oil runs out, we pick it apart like vultures. As well as exporting oil, Saudi exports wahhabism, but we don't want to antagonize the oil supplier, so we allow it's ideology
7648 2018-10-15 14:07:16 @HallieJackson If America switched Oil subsidies to Solar & Wind we wouldn't be made dependent on Oil & Weapons of War w/the Saudis- trump was always about Money not the best interests of our Nation or the American ppl- America is supposed 2B Independent from r Enemies Period!
7649 2018-10-15 14:07:09 Red oil spaghetti
7650 2018-10-15 14:07:08 for sure! but isn’t there an important difference in scale between private prisons and big oil?

7659 2018-10-15 14:06:34 Totally agree. But how is it possible to not like chick peas?
Whenever someone says they don't like anything, I tend to suggest they haven't been cooking it right.  Just need to add more butter/salt/olive oil/lemon/cream etc.
7660 2018-10-15 14:06:34 It's also another reason to "lean in" for the tipping point. Elon is the most solid bet we have ever had for clean tech. 

What about oil investors? Their value is pumped and manipulated by politicians lobbyists and subsidies. Their resource is finite. Shouldn't we warn them?

7663 2018-10-15 14:06:15 Tire rotation & oil change at the Granite Run Mall location, 2010ish.
7664 2018-10-15 14:06:11 Aku dah dekat oil field ni.
7665 2018-10-15 14:06:05 By all means look at the source of the wealth (Nazi Germany circa 1930's and 40's) and look at their trends away from socialism because they can no longer sustain it even at $90 / barrel oil
7666 2018-10-15 14:05:55 Stop oil and gas subsidies and put it into tech, like your party promised to get elected
7667 2018-10-15 14:05:55 gotta get an oil change 
7668 2018-10-15 14:05:52 Seems we ARE that dependent on saudi oil huh @realDonaldTrump
7669 2018-10-15 14:05:49 1/2: Clearly evident that anti-corruption slogans are just but ruses across the main political divide(PDP/APC), anything is possible in Naija. Atiku, the 'ginger' of Adamawa's companies and oil wells play in sync with the might of resources needed in this 2019 political match...

7673 2018-10-15 14:05:41 I have read too many negative comments about #Tesla, that grumble about the “taxpayer subsidies” owners of  #Tesla and other EV vehicles currently enjoy.  They are not aware of the massive tax give ways big oil receives?
7674 2018-10-15 14:05:35 So far the Govt doing a perfect model of how not to do Green GB - 1. fracking 2. cut subsidies to eco-cars 3. Seriously consider financing huge oil project in Bahrain 4. Suspend all new climate action till 2032 ...  and we're only on Day 1.....
7675 2018-10-15 14:05:34 Damn I’m so bad I finally got oil change after 8k miles 
7676 2018-10-15 14:05:29 6/ threatening with oil prices going to $200 or double that in the event of sanctions.Whatever takes down that monarchy,I will be grateful
7677 2018-10-15 14:05:26 The USA has more oil than the Saudis, we just aren’t using our supply

7688 2018-10-15 14:03:56 Nah, not true, over the last 35 years Scotland has been a net contributer to the UK, you are cherry picking one set of figures and with the upturn in oil discoveries we will be the wallet of the UK again. When we are independent we'll be the 14th richest country in the world.
7689 2018-10-15 14:03:50 Please hurry. I hate oil and beheadings. But remember who has the NUKES. Oil is everywhere on earth, lol. #FoolsErrand
7690 2018-10-15 14:03:49 @glennbeck , you imply #chiropractic is quackery in your 9:30 monologue, yet you advertise snake oil. I’m not a chiropractor, just someone who depends on my back’s proper working order to earn a living. Never once needed a knife to resolve back issues. @WorldOfStu
7691 2018-10-15 14:03:45 Yep. Not sounding alarms yet, but Yamo has now had 12 NHL games and produced zilch. Maybe he needs pro hockey experience in the A. Oil can’t wait another 12 to find out.
Meantime, speculation Kassian draws in vs Jets, for “toughness.” More likely, 2 dumb penalties against...

7699 2018-10-15 14:03:14 thankfully my hair is resilient as hell and when they’re in twists it’s easy to just oil my scalp and edges like every other week or so and they’re fine
7700 2018-10-15 14:03:12 I get that optimism can run a bit rampant and that middle ground is always a good place to be. It's a high risk stock. Especially when almost every other move towards sustainability has been shut out by misinformation campaigns and mass media and oil price manipulation.
7701 2018-10-15 14:03:05 I need an oil change like last month 
7702 2018-10-15 14:03:03 @hrabka1 / I believe we can refine our own oil and don’t have to travel to India. Cross border crossing radicals don’t help Canada.

7704 2018-10-15 14:03:00 Went in for an oil change ended up replacing pads, drive shafts, plugs and arms
7705 2018-10-15 14:02:55 I say dry like wet just that one line. I spray oil and let it sit for a bit then try to comb it out . If that doesn’t work then shampoo is my second option let it sit and then comb it out .
7706 2018-10-15 14:02:53 Bought by the fossil fuel industry, Alberta politicians only know one way to economic prosperity, more oil. Imagine the jobs that could be created if they used oil revenues to become leaders in solar energy,  and better automotive batteries.  China is doing it.
7707 2018-10-15 14:02:51 Jkx oil and gas moving again. More directors buying in. Take the hint. 100p 2018 target.
7708 2018-10-15 14:02:46 Yup.. Options r few for them then. India r definitely under extreme pressure now from US. I don't think they have any back up policy for this potential oil crisis
7709 2018-10-15 14:02:44 Oh shit. Essential oil diffuser.

I can start patronizing Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab again.

Yes! Yes yes yes.
7710 2018-10-15 14:02:44 Focking oil money , ur just as bad as @Math_lfc 
7711 2018-10-15 14:02:41 At the rate APC is digging out Atiku's past, they'll soon find oil.
7712 2018-10-15 14:02:34 Bunk. Saudi Arabia needs the US Market for its oil. It can't sell the oil to Russia, who is an oil competitor. It doesn't want Russian Bases in its country and traditionally has despised the Russians. This is all bluster.
7713 2018-10-15 14:02:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
7714 2018-10-15 14:02:32 I dont like Saudi Arabia either... I believe they are the ones who really carried out 9-11! Even though we r now a top oil exporter thanks to Trump! We will always need Saudi Oil! Which is why we will always be their friend despite all the corrupt shit they do!
7715 2018-10-15 14:02:30 It's his "Oil Outfit" from Xenoblade. He even had this as his eighth palette in the previous game.
7716 2018-10-15 14:02:16 @AlArabiya_Eng #POTUS used #Turkey to disappear #Khashoggi to acheive its goals for free.... fabricated under #Pastor
1. Double oil production, 
2. decrease oil price,  
3. buy more ammo 
4. #KSA to pay more to #USA for security
7717 2018-10-15 14:02:10 covered myself in that much oil for a tan I’m worried the Americans will try and put me in a fryer and serve me with a side of mac and cheese
7718 2018-10-15 14:02:07 Oil king takes the best photos!!! 
7719 2018-10-15 14:02:07 I suggest trump do his job and protect human rights as POTUS is supposed to do...there is credible evidence that needs to be thoroughly investigated and we are NOT dependent on Saudis for oil. Next year US is on track to be biggest exporter, we get 10% from Saudis.
7720 2018-10-15 14:02:02 Damn, you really need to get to the point. It's okay in your personal streams, because fans do know that you will eventually get to the point in like 2 hours, but when you're collabing with someone else, if just makes you looks like a snake oil saleman. 95% of wut u sed was fluff
7721 2018-10-15 14:01:54 Oooh, I should get one of those. First choice for the scented oil?
7722 2018-10-15 14:01:49 Boiled Yam with Red Oil

7725 2018-10-15 14:01:27 Not sure why you qualified "progressive" with "social".

They have used the "social" issues to pull people in. But they are wolves in sheep's clothing. They don't really want to cut back military spending, or break up banks, or fight big pharma or big oil. They like to get $$$
7726 2018-10-15 14:01:23 I need an oil change bad.

7730 2018-10-15 14:01:09 In 1971 Nixopn stated Soudis had to sell oil ,they are not going to drink it. Next Soudis stopped production and gas prixes jump fom 25 ents to adollar. If they do sme prices can go much higher han they are now. But Soudis cab]n not if nurder has tken place

7741 2018-10-15 14:00:37 So Saudis will hold oil over our heads if we interfere in their infernal affairs.Truth is that America can desire to do right by everyone but what we CAN do is sometimes limited. As long as we deal with the devil, and we have no choice here, we have to overlook devilish behavior.

7748 2018-10-15 13:59:44 Cinnamon oil aids in controlling your blood sugar and insulin release, which in turn keep your sugar cravings in check.

Stabilizing blood sugar levels with cinnamon oil keeps your body from craving sugary junk foods.

You are also less likely to overeat if you add cinnamon

7763 2018-10-15 13:58:26 They think we are idiots. It is so insulting the whole lying bullshit. Wake up America! The snake oil salesmen are in power.  I thought Americans use to take pride in their down-home savvy for smelling a rat. Now they've elected a rat and they are all going down with him.

7766 2018-10-15 13:58:17 why's bio oil gotta be so damn oily
7767 2018-10-15 13:58:10 Please start taking our climate crisis seriously, perhaps by asking the oil industry and your government to take drastic actions to reduce emissions starting now.
7768 2018-10-15 13:58:07 Without our “dirty” oil, the world will use dirtier oil from dirty dictatorships. This is something you lack understanding on.

7790 2018-10-15 13:56:45 In a bizarre turn of events, just as the US-Iran relations were going south, the US-Saudi relations too might be impacted with the recent turn of events.. Wonder how will this impact oil prices if US's relations with both Saudi and Iran go sour..
7791 2018-10-15 13:56:43 Actually, this worries me.  Oil & gas reserve valuations dropping to match up with zero carbon goals -》political chaos in Saudi, Iran and Russia.  Could get ugly.
7792 2018-10-15 13:56:43 New Mexico needs the oil/gas industry in order to MAGA  All New Mexicans profit from a strong oil/gas industry.
7793 2018-10-15 13:56:41 That exports were falling for the past few years is a well known fact,oil crash contributed since petrochemicals make a large chunk of our exports but there were other structural issues as well,none of modis making

7805 2018-10-15 13:55:55 Since Trump held office gas up 30% and oil up 45%, checked those numbers from Montana.
We have our own oil.

7818 2018-10-15 13:55:06 Fuck the chinese by putting sanctions on Saudi Arabia. We can make the Chinese pay and destroy their economy build at our expense and US will become the world's largest oil exporter by next year. WTI will become the benchmark, once again.
7819 2018-10-15 13:55:01 You can try doing the greenhouse method.  Basically oil/moisturise your hair every night with oils & water/ leave in. Put a plastic bag on top and then your satin cap. It will seriously change your moisture /softness game.
7820 2018-10-15 13:54:58 Only God knows how this country is running.. These freaks are absolute geniuses. At least try n copy China they r also getting oil & cheaper rates from Iran. Introduce some fucking reforms in taxes
7821 2018-10-15 13:54:57 Per Wikipedia:
Steam reforming generates carbon dioxide (CO2). ... it is possible to separate the CO2 and dispose of it without atmospheric release, for example by injecting it in an oil or gas reservoir (see carbon capture), although this is not currently done in most cases.

7856 2018-10-15 13:51:38 We receive 9% of our oil from SA & the Saudi’s are the ones phasing out their reliability on their oil not the US. Saudi is used for more than oil. Saudi’s have done much worse in past decades & under different US admin. None of these issues are new. But even past presidents
7857 2018-10-15 13:51:37 Oh lol.. I've just read this. Is this what you reffered to as subsidy scam? 

A rise in oil prices will cost the  government more to subsidize. That's only normal.
Save for the not-so-detailed info from govt. I cant see anything new or blame-worthy here.

7870 2018-10-15 13:50:46 They can no longer donate at Federal and most provincial levels. The have shifted toward dictating the conditions under which they will invest. This is exactly why we needed a publicly owned Petro Canada and exactly why oil companies and Conservatives hated it.
7871 2018-10-15 13:50:41 Saudi oil is 12% of US imports.  Canada provides 43%.  In 2019 US oil production will exceed Saudi and Russia.

7887 2018-10-15 13:49:28 There is a lot of fear pre-market about possible $400/barrel oil price.

What will that do to Tesla/EV demand?
7888 2018-10-15 13:49:27 I assume you mean in terms of efficiency or some other aspect of production...? Certainly not oil’s environmental, social, and inequity outcomes? (And I was more challenging this thread’s more critical participant to think in a solutions-oriented way )

7893 2018-10-15 13:49:00 President Trump must have been wearing his Dunce Cap to hang up the phone with the king of Saudi Arabia and inform the nation (and the world) of a "very strong" denial of murder by the king.

7895 2018-10-15 13:48:56 Agreed but there is still the challenge of consumer preference and habits. Even in milder parts of Virginia, folks that grew up with fuel oil won’t give it up and most people with heat pumps don’t know how to operate them without kicking them in to AUX or emergency heating

7901 2018-10-15 13:48:08 By the time you got back, you'd need another oil change.
7902 2018-10-15 13:48:02 No problem! My parents live near the creek and there is oil all down it. Crews have been working all night and still out there this morning trying to clean it up.
7903 2018-10-15 13:47:51 By rogue you mean Turkish in order to bring us into their conflict then you're on to something. 

With help from which US agency? October surprise? Oil prices?
7904 2018-10-15 13:47:48 Good article but no mention of sanctioning Saudi oil sales, denying them access to our bond market, or supporting regime change.
7905 2018-10-15 13:47:47 While you simmer in irrational anger, do some research on where eastern Canada currently gets its oil and what type of world those areas create for your grandchildren.  Enjoy the read.
7906 2018-10-15 13:47:39 Yes, people will not believe him that's why he is screaming loudly
Let him do his duty because once Oil is purchased for Rice after 4Nov2018 there is no issue left for him to scream!
He is helping India by helping BJP because all problems now having new solutions because of him
7907 2018-10-15 13:47:38 Their gonna bribe Pompeo with more money and oil deals and make up a bs excuse then he comes back and says it was not the saudis. It took 2 weeks for the saudis to allow turkey to go in the consulate, i guess thats the time it takes to clean up any evidence.

... and no protests then... but God forbid someone tunnels under their school. i.e. theres not even a stop at the school. It's literally just running under it.
7919 2018-10-15 13:46:38 The point, that you're carefully missing, is that our technology allows us to replace expansion of coal and oil already.

7924 2018-10-15 13:46:17 1. Bondi Sands Liquid Gold Oil. Dries quickly, leaves a nice golden colour, feels like my skin is nourished.
2. Streaking badly and leaving patches, strong smell, leaving my skin too orange!
3. I’d love a tan that leaves a glow similar to a dewy foundation..nothing glittery!
7925 2018-10-15 13:46:12 We've been sucking up to Saudis for generations because: oil and they buy our weapons. Here's an idea: we get into renewable energy and start making something else besides military hardware. Also, get better friends. #Kashoggi
7926 2018-10-15 13:46:10 @carlquintanilla Nonsense. there are 180 countries just starting the oil boom. Every drop of oil in the ground will be consumed by someone.

7941 2018-10-15 13:45:16 Imagine regime change in Saudi Arabia. We would own the oil. Control the key straights. We would be neighbors with Iran. And the rest of the kingdoms could go back to shopping in London. I mean they want to reform.  We could speed that up dramatically. #DickCheneyIsSmiling
7942 2018-10-15 13:44:54 So, they figured out what any oil maker could have told them right away: mind the terpenes.
7943 2018-10-15 13:44:53 Dow - over a thousand less now than Jan 18!
Oil - over $10 a barrel up since Jan 18!

Deficit as % of GDP, 4.2% now.  3.4% last year!

7952 2018-10-15 13:44:21 Q: How do you bleach your hair without damaging it?

A: It’ll always damage, but you can do good care with products to help your hair go healthy again. Use products with keratin and use hair masks 1-2 times weekly. Only bleach every 3-4 weeks, not sooner. Also coconut oil is good
7953 2018-10-15 13:44:18 Good point you make. But I have a question, do you think the gov should start focusing on alternatives to oil usage? Maybe focus more on a more renewable natural resources?
7954 2018-10-15 13:44:15 It's the #climatedeniars that have a big political agenda. In tight with Big Oil and the Koch Brothers. Putting profit before the welfare of humanity and the planet. Trump only cares about money.
7955 2018-10-15 13:44:08 Literally what is happening here in Norway right now:

Enviromentalists: You need to stop pumping oil, it hurts the enviroment!

Gov: Fine. We will invest in more dams and windmills then.

Enviromentalists: You need to stop that too, it hurts nature's beauty!

Fine we'll just die
7956 2018-10-15 13:44:06 If you want gold - invest in space exploration ! The Middle East has all the gold - they have been trading oil money for gold for years !
7957 2018-10-15 13:44:02 And you believe him because OIL MONEY
7958 2018-10-15 13:43:53 True oil is very dangerous but there must be corrective measure to mitigate just incase of anything
7959 2018-10-15 13:43:52 yeah, but they brought out the 'empty' 45 gal drums for diesel generator fuel oil days ago. In the middle of the night, no doubt.
7960 2018-10-15 13:43:52 I randomly bought sweet almond oil. My face is thanking me.

7963 2018-10-15 13:43:35 Re Khashoggi matter, we have gone from a fiery 1st response fm Saudis, to public stmts fm the King to investigate+at the CERA India conference,  statements from Khalid to assure the mkt will be supplied, ie. oil will not be used as a political weapon in this. Mkt fizzling. #OOTT

7965 2018-10-15 13:43:27 Just 100 companies in the world are responsible for 71% of carbon emissions. These are mostly oil companies. Now you tell me what consumers can do to change that. Next we go to food production...we can’t change how food is produced even if we change consumption.
7966 2018-10-15 13:43:10 America's elite can't abandon Saudis too much - need their oil and them as a cash-rich market.
7967 2018-10-15 13:43:05 Saudi Arabia has Donald Trump hostage!! If he puts sanctions on them they will raise oil prices. Trump is putting his tail between his legs and letting them get away with murder. Great President isn’t he. Let Saudi Arabia dictate to him!!
7968 2018-10-15 13:43:03 Is this going to be another Iraq after 9/11. They must have oil we want for ourselves. What a slime ball. It's almost a shame to call ourselves human.
7969 2018-10-15 13:42:49 Again with the rage 
No-one important listens to nonsense like the stuff you’re spouting. Trump will be gone two years from now, and in the mean time, renewable energy will grow and continue to outperform FF. Wind and solar already employs more people globally than oil and gas.

7976 2018-10-15 13:42:09 Hmmm wonder who funds the oil and gas industry...?

7978 2018-10-15 13:41:58 maybe use to oil control andmake the face so smooth, if we use a make up will be complete , is the benefits of baseprimer to face
7979 2018-10-15 13:41:57 How much synthetic material are you wearing on you right now? Until petroleum free alternatives are developed, we'll still need oil for a while longer. The best we can do right now is to reduce the emissions coming from burning the bloody stuff in the first place.
7980 2018-10-15 13:41:53 Here's the thing:  We make more oil than anyone.  If the price goes up, our oil complex springs into action to produce more oil at the higher price.  More U. S. jobs, more domestic oil that doesn't have to be imported, and limits on the price increase due to higher supplies.
7981 2018-10-15 13:41:46 Can't wait for my kids to live in a hellworld without access to food and water because political dipshits like @tedcruz want to have a cool office and fancy dinners with old white oil and gas billionaires.
7982 2018-10-15 13:41:45 Bernstein:  Based on tanker data we track (Kpler), OPEC exports were at 25.6MMbls/d in September, a decrease of 0.5MMbls/d m-o-m largely due to the cut in Iranian exports.

7993 2018-10-15 13:41:03 I believe tentatively that that is a different question. I could have asked the question I care about without mentioning currencies; I could have said something with commodities like "the median of {1 liter of oil, 2 kWh of electricity, ...}"
7994 2018-10-15 13:40:56 good job but they need lasting solution yes. We drain oil and give relief materials  or nothing, it's sad yes. 
7995 2018-10-15 13:40:56 Fossil fuels have had many advantages and some of them are very hard to top. Oil for example still has no real competition, unlike coal/lignite.

8034 2018-10-15 13:38:39 I always thought it was a mistake for the Left to harp on our double standard with Saudi Arabia as a way of trying to scuttle U.S. aggression in the Middle East. America's special reelation with the Saudis was built on sand. The oil beneath the sand is the thing.
8035 2018-10-15 13:38:33 Post oil? How?
8036 2018-10-15 13:38:31 Excuse me have you heard about electric cars? TESLA is made in america! The US has all the tech to make alternative sources of energy and has its own oil supply!

Dow - over a thousand less now than Jan 18!
Oil - over $10 a barrel up since Jan 18!
Wage growth YTD increase 2.7%!
Cost of living YTD increase 2.9%!
Deficit as % of GDP, 4.2% now.  3.4% last year!
Winning?

 Now that we are 100% energy sufficient, it may be time to invoke price controls so that OPEC cannot dictate pricing.  Pricing caps on oil products would prevent OPEC from driving up prices to our consumers.  We had oil price controls in the 70's.

8054 2018-10-15 13:37:06 No government official threatened to use oil as a weapon.
8055 2018-10-15 13:37:05 Yes. Agree. As we convert, we must be  assured that those in the oil industries have the opportunities to retrain for other jobs.
8056 2018-10-15 13:37:03 Ah, so now we see an attempt at moving to the standard tactic of the deluded-a dose of Whataboutery!

The particular whataboutery you've tried shows you don't grasp how pooling and sharing works-in Peak Oil we were net contributors. Also it's NOT just a fiscal argument, is it?

8072 2018-10-15 13:35:54 That makes more sense. $TESLAQ can be a "hero" -feel signifigant- fill their ego - by being "right". The discoverer of hidden truths... This fits right in with the egoic incentive theory. 

I guess discovering / exposing how entrenched big oil cronyism is was just sooo 1990s? :)
8073 2018-10-15 13:35:48 Even if the oil will be 1000, and Tesla would have received all contracts of the world, it will still have a sluggish production output. Other car manufacturers are having much better production conveyor, dealers and service network.
8074 2018-10-15 13:35:45 Lol, all that Oil Money banter will come back to haunt just like the 'Chelsea try to buy the league.'
8075 2018-10-15 13:35:43 Flake the fake. Climate change is a liberal hoax designed to destroy the oil industry.
8076 2018-10-15 13:35:42 Ahem. The Dow just plunged and oil is up $20 a barrel. Is your president responsible for that?
8077 2018-10-15 13:35:39 Your past peak oil anyway... Running out.... so what's the point anyway?
8078 2018-10-15 13:35:34 Until the world stops fighting over natural resources there will be no peace. Keep your oil!
8079 2018-10-15 13:35:08 True. The Saudis are famous for big announcements, mostly about oil production, which then calms the markets & Riyadh never actually changes production.
8080 2018-10-15 13:35:08 So  King Salman will liberate the women of Saudi Arabia?
Please.
Saudi's have the worst human rights record on the globe.
When the oil is gone what will Saudi Arabia have?
8081 2018-10-15 13:35:07 So your position is that the Sc Gov is deliberately lying about the fiscal position of the Country, and despite idiotic assertions like yours, no FM has ever said GERS is wrong? Really?

How much oil revenue did we bring in last year (our geographical share)? Subsidising UK???
8082 2018-10-15 13:35:00 Electric cars are better, keep your oil.
8083 2018-10-15 13:34:55 To clarify, E3 wants oil waivers for India/China not itself. 

On humanitarian, Hook/Pompeo are on the record promising to protect it and this has been a key ask from EU/E3 for months. I think they will have to do something via OFAC.
8084 2018-10-15 13:34:51 Wagging the dog: think about how many states and individuals benefit from (or desperately needed) a spike in oil prices.
8085 2018-10-15 13:34:24 Painfully obvious Trump needs to find an excuse, however lame, to not hold Saudia Arabia accountable. Oil and a counterweight to Iran too important to him.  He will accept egregious human rights violations and murder.

8087 2018-10-15 13:34:21 You think science is seeking wealth distribution through fraud and believe big oil, coal are not hurting the environment.If these scientists are using your tax dollars for fraud, how do you explain environml research in other countries that show the same results?World conspiracy?
8088 2018-10-15 13:34:12 Right like that’s going to happen with oil at $85 a barrel and Trumps $100 billion arms deal with the Saudis… You peel the onion you do the math on this one, not hard to figure out even if you’ve had a lobotomy.
8089 2018-10-15 13:34:11 No it was not. Selling weapons, buying oil, and Jared Kushner’s coziness with the House of Saud will keep the trump crime syndicate from anything meaningful.
8090 2018-10-15 13:34:02 when consumers ignore price because it's covered by insurance, this only encourages costs to increase and then premiums increase over time. I don't use car insurance to buy tires or get oil change. It's out of pocket, which is why oil changes don't cost $1000.

8099 2018-10-15 13:33:33 Here's the thing.  The oil industry has massively more complex variables when project planning.  You can't predict weather.  Yet, I bet your project management is more accurate than R*'s and you hit more targets with fewer burnouts.

8116 2018-10-15 13:32:38 Exactly! To check her own oil. How to depend on her intuition and the confidence to know she can do anything she sets her mind to.

4) if default on domestic debt also, all the banks would collapse and your savings would vanish
8130 2018-10-15 13:31:03 @realDonaldTrump  Why did David say in the Psalms that God anointed his head with oil? As a shepherd David would anoint his sheep’s head with oil to Protect them from brambles and briars(crooks and liars). May his anointing be upon you in a MIGHTY way.

8134 2018-10-15 13:30:57 Just like with Bush, this is a "Who's really your daddy" moment! Big oil money is telling Trump to look the other way and because it is a journalist involved he is more than happy to do so.

8145 2018-10-15 13:30:19 I'll believe it when I see it! SA needs the oil revenue as bad as we need the oil prices to stay <$100/barrel. The US, in particular, is tied tightly to oil prices. Trump will side with the kingdom before he accepts a recession.

8176 2018-10-15 13:27:24 Threatening Saudi Arabia by Trump is abhorrent.The US had eliminated several dissenting Heads of States in the Arab and Non-Arab world. Trump is aiming at Saudi oil. Arab Nations must be conscious about this greed.They
must be careful on human rights.
8177 2018-10-15 13:27:14 Do you think that maybe your pro-pipeline stance makes you look hypocritical here? I support the carbon tax but not if we're still going to build pipelines and promote dirty oil.

So much productivity

8202 2018-10-15 13:25:42 While SA could raise prices and hurt U.S., they would hurt themselves more. $400 is a bluff. Russia would undercut them, as would every other oil producer. $100-$150 is possible, but then they would seriously harm the world economy and certainly speed the move to renewable.
8203 2018-10-15 13:25:39 You can’t drink oil and you can’t eat money.
8204 2018-10-15 13:25:37 Hahah and you too enjoy  the oil and drive as much as u can while still there is oil (: if y have car hahah I feel sorry for  stupiths

Excise cut done on 04th Oct and crute oil rate was 5600..
Today, 15/10, crude oil rate is 5300 so why rates were increased in last 10 days, this is not correct but loot of money.

8219 2018-10-15 13:24:40 Would be interesting to see at what price is oil non competitive with renewable energy. Since renewables currently cant scale, I think that number would be far higher than $200.
8220 2018-10-15 13:24:37 Even with higher oil revenues, it is clear that the provincial Liberal government’s lack of a strategy to reduce spending is making a bad situation much worse. Revenues are down, expenses are up... this cannot continue. #nlpoli

8232 2018-10-15 13:23:47 Trump says climate scientists have political agendas. CO2 & methane emissions cause climate change.

8235 2018-10-15 13:23:36 Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate against the USA by massive price increases of oil if sanctions are imposed for the possible murder of the journalist.

The lesson to be fully understood is that the USA and Texas should be absolutely energy independent.

8280 2018-10-15 13:19:35 And yes, we should absolutely not be giving any corporation money to prop anything up. That includes oil, even though that would drastically increase the price of gas; however due to lack of regulations that would also creat incentive for renewables.

8311 2018-10-15 13:17:26 Problem: very large percentage of gas surge comes from tight oil plays. If you believe hype, that gas is "free." Regardless, tight oil production continues to increase despite take-away constraints from Permian basin. Bakken & Eagle Ford output > than I expected b/c of price.

8318 2018-10-15 13:16:42 Forget the oil, why is the US so focused on it? Isn't this sending us the message that we need to start advocating for a #renewable future instead??

If we go 100% electric two things happen. 
1. We limit climate change.
2. We leave the middle east to those that live there.
Don't forget most of the 9/11 terrorist came from SAUDI ARABIA.

8329 2018-10-15 13:15:55 We can't wait until 2030 for oil consumption to fall. It makes no sense to increase oil supply when we need to reduce GHG emissions to fight #climatechange - ergo no TMX.

8333 2018-10-15 13:15:41 Kinda like we can change coal to energy or oil to fuel in an hour. But how long does it take to make coal or oil. "It'll change back" my ass. Maybe in a million years if this planet is still around.
8334 2018-10-15 13:15:41 Decided I am going as a mechanic for halloween so I can walk around all night asking everybody if they want their oil changed or if they want rim jobs.
8335 2018-10-15 13:15:40 But it cut into the billions of profit for his coal and oil friends
8336 2018-10-15 13:15:30 7th grade found out how difficult it is to clean up an oil spill and how it effects the ecosystem.
8337 2018-10-15 13:15:29 It isn't. Our government and many of our companies fight against pollution regulation tooth and nail. I don't have any idea where you're getting your information from, but renewable energy is not being invested in as much as oil or other fossil fuels.
8338 2018-10-15 13:15:23 They (the oil companies and those who profit) have us convinced that we are the problem and thus we endure so many direct and indirect economic burdens. Our Civic leaders have to champion alternate fuel.

8352 2018-10-15 13:12:55 Nothing will come of it. We are slaves to the Saudis and their oil. Disgusting.
8353 2018-10-15 13:12:51 If the U.S. & other nations impose sanctions on Saudi exports of crude,it will cause Brent oil prices to surge to over $100.00 a barrel,pushing the world economy into recession.
8354 2018-10-15 13:12:50 They should do it, because every major recession has also been linked to high oil prices. $200/bbl would push the world into a major depression and equally tank oil prices, bringing it back to $30/bbl. Their actions would severely undercut their own economy and the Gulf Sheikhs.

8364 2018-10-15 13:11:53 Sometimes Facts hurt the feelings of gullible useful idiots.
Does it mean we should not use facts and instead rely on pallywood propaganda paid by oil money and propagated by leftists? 
Speaking of puppets, those leftist dont know what monster (islamism) they are sleeping with
8365 2018-10-15 13:11:40 When today in international markets crude oil prices have follen up to 5 percent and now it is on 80 dollar a barrel,why in India prices are not lowering? We should know that 40 percent of crude oil is imported by the private companies whose profits are depositing in their bank.

8371 2018-10-15 13:11:19 I think what he's referring is the recent downgrade in our oil to $17/barrel. Demand is very low, but we've over produced and now we have too much supply. There's no one buying but we kept producing so there is a lot of inventory.
8372 2018-10-15 13:11:16 I like to sketch it out first. Then you want to paint the darker shades of the face. You want to paint in thin layers. Then let it dry. Then go back and add more. A typical oil painting takes me about 3 to 4 months.
8373 2018-10-15 13:11:16 @TheDaleJackson I am hating on a Saudi regime that believes its oil can let them get away with murdering a US resident.
8374 2018-10-15 13:11:10 I guess the sign @SPhillipsAB is holding isn’t quite true. The current Alberta oil situation IS a problem and the Alberta NDP government really doesn’t have a very clear crystal ball.
8375 2018-10-15 13:10:54 Cuz the oil companies donated to the liberals? Pretty sure they donate to both main parties but the liberals don't advertise it. Campaign left, govern right.
8376 2018-10-15 13:10:53 @MrAstrotheology hi i have recently learned about the sacred oil and im eager to learn as much as possible but have you succeeded in rising this oil ? And if so how would you describe it?

8379 2018-10-15 13:10:38 The US is not dependent on Saudi oil imports. It is almost energy self-sufficient.

Any shortages that might occur can be made by imports for Canada and Mexico-countries that the president has done his best to alienate.

8403 2018-10-15 13:08:11 While some of China's activities in Africa is questionable, their aid has had positively impacted the lives of millions. E.g. building rail lines, power plants, oil refineries etc that never existed. Still scratching my head to find western "aid" comparable to China's.
8404 2018-10-15 13:08:10 There are two ways the government can help Albertan workers:

2. Invest in knowledge economy sectors to create long-term, sustainable jobs for Albertans

But you have all the logics to prove that the price hike is good even though the prices in international market are cheaper than 2014

Meanwhile, after hurricane Michael, FEMA is MIA, many still reported missing and inadequate supplies
8435 2018-10-15 13:05:08 This is going to cause SA to be isolated from the international community. Now that SA is the number 3/4 oil producer (could go lower shortly) SA no longer wield the influence it did ten 2 years ago.

8438 2018-10-15 13:05:07 Here's an idea: Stop selling oil. Did none of you people read the IPCC's report? Why are we more concerned about "markets" than climate change. I'm pretty sure the IPCC said that we need drastic action. Stop bragging about your contributions to climate change.

8440 2018-10-15 13:04:57 Israel is a tiny country, some 1% of the Mideast. Arab states some 99% of Mideast. Currently fashionably to portray Israel as force of oppression trampling over  impoverished oil states.

And don't forget the best ingredient: sesame oil

8446 2018-10-15 13:04:29 @CNN please do not spend today's news cycle repeating and rehashing this crazy interview. Floridians are missing/dying, a journalist is missing/presumed murdered/dismembered, Saudis are threatening oil prices, etc. There's so much more going on than the crazy.

8448 2018-10-15 13:04:08 Canada has the 2nd largest oil reserves on the planet.  So threats won't work.
8449 2018-10-15 13:04:07 Saudi if raise oil price many countries will go bankrupt.
Bankrupt countries will have to accept yuan as reserve currency. USD role will be sized down. RMB and Euro role will gain. GAME is well designed and controlled undoubtedly.
8450 2018-10-15 13:04:02 them oil people earn that in a month not a year.
8451 2018-10-15 13:03:49 The reserves are also declining. The reserves are also not something to brag about because it is not influenced by government but by the oil price and quantity sold. It is hard to find a good number in Nigeria at present if we are clear about the definition of a good number.

8477 2018-10-15 13:01:57 Now more than ever, the US  needs to get off of its heavy dependence on Saudi and OPEC oil. These Arabs would be the poorest nations without it.

8516 2018-10-15 12:57:25 @MyStateline Regarding on your story related to a response to S. Arabia, I believe that we only import about 20% of our oil and 40% comes from Canada. Middle Eastern oil coming to the US is small. This has changed with our oil boom here.
8517 2018-10-15 12:57:17 So they can discuss crude oil?
8518 2018-10-15 12:57:14 alright, running an experiment with my dog's dermatitis and cbd oil :/.
8519 2018-10-15 12:57:03 US still running huge deficits thus sending lots of dollars offshore. But not to all the same places and less than it would be had domestic oil production exploded. I am suggesting the petro part is what is very different now.

8531 2018-10-15 12:55:23 It is not just about jobs. According to an NPR report I just listened to, if the Saudis cut oil production, this could cause world oil prices to shoot way up. I favor re-establishing trade and diplomatic relations with Iran. But you know how the Trump administration feels re this
8532 2018-10-15 12:55:21 It's alright everyone no need to worry. According the eminent climate change scientis Mr Trump climate change might "change back" so nothing to worry about it turns out. Carry on burning your coal or even better try Russian oil!
8533 2018-10-15 12:55:02 I tried my hand at oil painting, and I was inept, and that part was okay, but then I had to clean up afterward, and it was like that ineptitude was continually reborn as the kitchen became a more and more horrific mess
8534 2018-10-15 12:55:00 Did it address the initial question of what he is doing to tackle corruption has he has claimed and admitted to as a problem? And the oil theft, did his answer saying the world must condemn the act answer the question on the preventive measures been taken to prevent the theft?
8535 2018-10-15 12:54:53 I believe she does want to change things for the better.  I also believe it was a terrible mistake to hitch her party's wagon to the oil sands. People voted for change at the last election: they didn't really get it and it's energized the opposition.

8538 2018-10-15 12:54:47 @jackwereW Maritime borders were made in 1960, so it’s Kenya who is trying to CLAIM and change the rules now.

8551 2018-10-15 12:53:48 I have no idea. It impacts oil and futures rallied on it.

8563 2018-10-15 12:52:56 Mexico has oil as well, not just your country.
8564 2018-10-15 12:52:52 This is the oil painting of colonial era Tony Soprano leading a horse
8565 2018-10-15 12:52:41 GOP claims correcting climate change will hurt the economy when the reality is the opposite is true. GOP has too much money invested in oil and gas to change course, knowing their children will not be the ones affected by rising waters!
8566 2018-10-15 12:52:35 ...and he's right. She caked it on so thick I'm sure it got all over him.  They were oil and water.  Both wanting control.  They talked over each other constantly never listening, never trying to work things out in a calm sensible way.
8567 2018-10-15 12:52:33 If I like make I turn to crude oil I'll still look
8568 2018-10-15 12:52:31 I recently heard that the U.S. is now the biggest exporter of oil in the world. So I think we've got our own supply covered, if need be... and if the brainiacs in D.C. (tRUmp, GOP peons) can think in that direction instead of thinking solely in the direction of greed.
8569 2018-10-15 12:52:12 

He also said oil producers must sell oil for cheap!
8570 2018-10-15 12:52:03 We dont need your oil... lololll

8572 2018-10-15 12:51:50 Oh so I guess if the king says what you need to hear so you can keep selling them weapons and buying their oil we should just believe them then I guess......ugh #LiarInChief #Rube #Monster

8574 2018-10-15 12:51:48 Oil production is not the whole economy. High gas prices would be great for LA & TX oil sector, but the cost of doing business would hurt everyone else.
8575 2018-10-15 12:51:45 19 of the 21 9/11 plane hijackers were Saudis, yet we did nothing because the Bush had oil ties to Saudi Arabia. What's different now ?!
8576 2018-10-15 12:51:42 I know that one: massaging with wintergreen oil helps my hands a little. But I often have to drive, even in summer, with thick gloves on. Makes keyboard work very interesting! As for the other joints - sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. Just keep moving.

8582 2018-10-15 12:50:59 It is time for the US to terminate our relationship with Saudi Arabia. We have funded weapons used in Yemen that have killed civilians indiscriminately. Our president bends to their every whim and it is disgusting. The country is corrupt and it time we put human rights above oil.
8583 2018-10-15 12:50:43 So in summary you’re saying based on fundamentals of fuel pricing, fuel price is fair at N145 and it is okay for subsidies to be paid and even increased regardless of stable and rising oil prices globally, because we have the 6th cheapeast price in the world right?

8602 2018-10-15 12:48:20 I agree. Let’s bomb them back to the Stone Age, right tough guy. Maybe just get them to stop selling their oil. That’d destroy world economy, but, hey, we’ll show them! You are a total joke, General Krassenstein!

8605 2018-10-15 12:48:04 Because men don't do well telling people they're going to control your life & overtax them greatly. Women are now being used by globalists & democrats to sell their snake oil on American public
8606 2018-10-15 12:48:00 Sir I read your comments which u had given in meeting with oil companies,sir I have suggestions regarding rupee, u tell opec to take Indian rupee for oil and tell them to invest in Indian share market,money can increase  #NarendraModi
8607 2018-10-15 12:47:50 #China, #India, #Turkey & many more are still doing business with #Iran. buying Iranian oil. According to rumors, #Russia has made a deal with #Iran to buy their oil & sell it under the Russian banner. #Putin is a genius.

8609 2018-10-15 12:47:40 3/If you ask what our first task was, coming into government in 1999, it was to bring stability to the economy after decades of military rule. For example, between 1999 and 2003, oil prices then were hovering between $16 and $28 yet we managed to pay up salary arrears.@atiku
8610 2018-10-15 12:47:36 HI TO ALL! Need a case of wine? Gallons of olive oil? If you shop on Thursday 10/18 at any of the 32 Whole Foods Markets in Massachusetts, they will give our non-profit organization Let's Talk About Food 5% of the profits for the day. BUY BUY BUY (but do it on 
Thursday!)
8611 2018-10-15 12:47:34 Thank You! It’s not a gimmick of any kind I swear it. Four of her paintings are there for you to see. She is a huge #Trump Fan and a talented oil painter! She is 6th out of 50 and we have 28 hours!
8612 2018-10-15 12:47:34 The human body is so amazing (still not used to changes) but i thank thee my oilburya friends for crafting a "fart oil" exclusively for my constipation.
8613 2018-10-15 12:47:32 Lots of money buying Treasuries. my point is how much the drop in flow of $ offshore to pay for oil has disrupted the previous 30 yr role of the petro dollar. A major reason US rebound from 08/09 crisis was better than much of the globe.
8614 2018-10-15 12:47:25 I’m struggling in seeing the appeal of European football turning into some soft power competition between oil rich ME states.
8615 2018-10-15 12:47:25 These ass-lickers are asking du30 to suspend the excise tax on oil after so much suffering have been inflicted by that stupid TRAIN law they were signatories to? People should take note of the signatories in this letter so they’ll know whom not to vote for!
8616 2018-10-15 12:47:20 On the role of #data in society, by calling it the new “oil/currency”, it suggests that it's a natural resource & that the corporations that find them have the moral right to earn/use them. – @BPrainsack (@univienna) | @WorldHealthSmt #WHS2018 @IFMSA

8626 2018-10-15 12:46:45 Some unlikely arguments here. To name 2: 1) if it was so easy to price oil trades in another currency, the EU would already have done this 2protect #JCPOA; 2) the US doesn't require #Saudi oil any longer. Apart from that, US sanctions are unlikely unless US Congress shifts gear.

8630 2018-10-15 12:46:21 What? Oil is 4 bucks cheaper a barrel this am than it was this time last week.  Panic is what's  driving the oil market not production.

8634 2018-10-15 12:46:16 Yes we can do that for sure as soon as pipeline is built for oil but only until we change over from dirty plastic makimg oil to a renewable souece of energy - we are able to jus need to move forward all us policies seen to be  movong back in time
8635 2018-10-15 12:46:07 สบายใจขึ้นหรือยังครับ
8636 2018-10-15 12:46:01 Marco, history will remember you as an oil company/NRA stooge who had multiple opportunities to do the right thing - for the entire world - and didn’t. Despicable.
8637 2018-10-15 12:45:51 It's good the palm oil is clearly marked as palm oil but the question was about where the oil was sourced from and can you say it was farmed in manner that does not cause mass un-nessasary destruction of rain forest.?
8638 2018-10-15 12:45:42 I got selected to do this school health survey and I get a chance to win an essential oil diffuser. If you ain’t talking iPads, I ain’t talking survey
8639 2018-10-15 12:45:40 Not exactly, you are a very rich oil "kingdom" and you have spread the wealth ideology that buying anything you want versus anything you need is what leads to waste. We are no better in those regards. Instead, putting that wealth into lifting up everyone leads to a better nation.
8640 2018-10-15 12:45:25 Real metaphor for my life: my gas tank is empty, my car needs an oil change + I have a flat tire (+ I live in a neighborhood cut off from the city bc of racism). And I can’t afford to fix any of this while being lectured about equity in the water sector by funders 
8641 2018-10-15 12:45:09 え、、すごくいま納得した、、、なるほどだから神絵師は絵を投下するのか、、なるほど、、、、
8642 2018-10-15 12:45:09 Actually there are a few other sources of low grade oil. That is the shrinking market they are targeting.
But yes, that is why it is so cheap in the US, they have an abundance of higher grades now.
8643 2018-10-15 12:45:08 The whole fuckin thing is a shit show. A bunch of out of touch business people slinging muck at each other while goin around the country like snake oil salesmen showing up at events and kissing babies. I wouldn’t get involved either.

8652 2018-10-15 12:44:19 $Oil price stabilization (US re imposed sanctions on Iran) give Saudis leverage on the presumably slaying of Khashoggi.

Aramco’s IPO looms and hundreds of billions pending on arm sales to the Kingdom trigger lobbing efforts in DC.

Saudis are submitting Trump with an arm bar!
8653 2018-10-15 12:44:13 Best economy thriving on oil price. nothing else. Nigeria is still a poor country
8654 2018-10-15 12:44:06 the King is bloody lying thru his teeth and YOU know it, we all do. But you have all those defence contracts to think of. W out oil they're nothing but goatherders.
8655 2018-10-15 12:43:48 Are you trying to cause a gas shortage in America do you realise if Saudi Arabia stops pumping oil gas prices will go up so far we will be in trouble
8656 2018-10-15 12:43:44 Oil they your head bros
8657 2018-10-15 12:43:40 You prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil , my cup overflows
Psalm 23:5
8658 2018-10-15 12:43:39 Wrong. Despite fighting in Iraq for almost a decade, the USA got no oil out of the conflict. China, which opposed the war, was the biggest foreign beneficiary of what became Iraq's booming oil business industry, following the end of the war.
8659 2018-10-15 12:43:34 coincidence duck! Your economy lost  Jobs due to GDP contraction caused by crude shock! if oil price stays up for a while, jobs will be back, it's a normal phenomenon, in 2008 when d US was in recession, dia unemployment rate moved from 4% to nearly 10%, 
Buhari isnt d problem

Tas feel ko yung pimples ko din ga-mangkok din idadami hihe 
8663 2018-10-15 12:43:04 so a friend just told me they are selling cooking oil 
8664 2018-10-15 12:42:39 A bit of calm before the open....despite the quick escalation in tensions with the Saudis over the disappearance of #Khashoggi , oil prices aren't making too big of a move.  Stock futures are mildly lower.
8665 2018-10-15 12:42:24 I find it unreal that people walk around smelling like patchouli oil.
8666 2018-10-15 12:42:22 Central banks need to print oil ...

uh ... what?
8667 2018-10-15 12:42:22 we can expect another increase in food cost between 1-3% depending or location as crude oil prices have risen between .77-.96% daily for the last two weeks. So also paying more at the pump.
The stock market dropped 1,846 points last week.
8668 2018-10-15 12:42:18 If it’s in season where you are, baked butter nut squash is amazing! Put it in a large pan with olive oil salt and pepper (garlic too maybe if you want a little more taste) and just bake it for a bit till it’s brown on the edges! It’s SUPER good, sweet, and reasonably healthy :3
8669 2018-10-15 12:42:10 しかも２回目のホッパーエラーの時も別の店員がデカ箱持ってきたという...
8670 2018-10-15 12:42:09 That's fantastic, can we now have resource control, since oil is irrelevant.
8671 2018-10-15 12:42:02 These fools have no idea how ubiquitous oil and gas are in daily life. 50-60% of food costs come from oil. It would be nearly impossible to remove. Unless you’re going back to stone tools and living in a cave.
8672 2018-10-15 12:41:58 Saudi Arabia is one of the strongest economies in the world, especially oil, and it can do the impossible if it hurts its people and its national security.
There are also one billion Muslims who owe allegiance to Saudi Arabia, and these are from 
8673 2018-10-15 12:41:56 Mwanawasa signed an agreement with Angola 
RB signed an agreement with Angola 
Sata signed an agreement with Angola 
Now government has signed an agreement with Angola ,
How many agreements do they have to sign for the oil to imported?
Please don't add salt our wounds
8674 2018-10-15 12:41:55 And I think a lot of people would argue that the one place for oil in the future is in the form of durable plastics like in my laptop which you want me to give up.
8675 2018-10-15 12:41:49 Wonderfully reasoned argument,  thanks for the answer to "permission to sod off, sir?" Scotch whisky is 20% of UK food & drink exports, will now be all ours, we've 25% of Europe's offshore wind and tidal power resources and 60% UK onshore wind power resource, oh, and the oil 
8676 2018-10-15 12:41:41 It wasn't my car, I work at an independent shop. We called the dealer and was told this. We were trying to do a 30k service on a 2014 Discovery Sport. We could not find the right spec oil for it and asked the dealer if we could get oil "We don't sell it in qts, only bulk".

8678 2018-10-15 12:41:34 The US yield curve coupled with high oil prices  has undermined share prices. While there are some similarities to the February correction, US real rates are still below their historical trend, while the US is one of the few countries seeing positive earnings revisions.

8699 2018-10-15 12:40:12 Oh, I agree in terms of what sanctions we may levy.  But, it seems to me, that the threat implicit in what KSA said in its original statement (watered somewhat by the Embassy's prudent "clarification") is that they would resort to some kind of oil related restriction.

8722 2018-10-15 12:38:23 @DanProft I think Turkey is trying to help Iran stave off the looming oil sanctions, and everybody that got that "free" stay at the Ritz has a reason to get back at Bin Salman. Turkey has a bit too much intel on what happened, and the left's response seemed a bit prepared.

After all, if big oil wanted to drill in your back yard would you want a person that was funded by you and your neighbors or an oil company?
8729 2018-10-15 12:37:56 What about oil?
8730 2018-10-15 12:37:55 3.5 mln +.3 mln = remaining 0.2 mln seems no problem at all. And if add all oil they export, could be even bigger)))

8734 2018-10-15 12:37:24 (Regular) Oil doesn’t give you waves, the point of oil is moisturize your hair. The point of wave grease is to give you waves, so you have to melt the grease. The grease is intended to give you waves so you melt it into an oil, because they don’t make wave oil lol.
8735 2018-10-15 12:37:20 Saudi Arabia has 260billion barrels of oil and produces 7M barrels per day making it the world's largest oil exporter...A position it will hold for 103 years before it's oil reserves are exhausted

No appreciation from world leaders in this at all. Only to blame us in every spike in the prices.

There’s a lot of factors that determine the price volatility

8755 2018-10-15 12:35:21 The nature of the "petro dollar" changed drastically as US domestic oil production rebounded. Hundreds of Billions of $ per year are no longer being pumped offshore. The recycling of that money into Treasuries can no longer happen.
8756 2018-10-15 12:35:18 Hey India,
For the last 70 years, you imported almost 80% of your oil. You still don't have a work around? No effort or research, Yet?

Just looking at those numbers tells a whole different story.  @MORTHIndia @nitin_gadkari @PonnaarrBJP

Time for the world to stop sponsoring this state terrorist....saudi petro dollars in their billions spread worldwide along with extremist Wahhabism.

8827 2018-10-15 12:27:43 I’ve heard fm him also that he is going to resurrect national oil industry. So in what form comes the resurrection?
8828 2018-10-15 12:27:40 waking up and I realized I meant vegetable oil, not olive oil  I should not tweet while tired!!
8829 2018-10-15 12:27:25 Scientists have a political agenda? There are oil barons galore begging them to accept their millions for grants as long as they will show that #ClimateChange isn't happening or at least isn't our fault. But scientists, most of them, have what Trump won't understand: #Integrity!
8830 2018-10-15 12:27:25 i do NOT Know
about current Diplomatic conditions
between the US & IRAN
@MalcolmNance or @RBReich might add to my question
BUT
with my OUTRAGE over
NEW E15 Ethanol
being forced on Us by Trump&Iowa
IS IT Possible
That we can normalize relations with them
and buy Their Oil?
WinWin?
8831 2018-10-15 12:27:23 Yes, it does. Considering the ridiculously low royalties AB charges, the oil companies can easily absorb it.

8833 2018-10-15 12:27:22 This guy speaks against SA justifying it with a 45 yr old oil impasse.This is just trade talk, defining positions (exactly what Trump does), both countries determined to get the best for their people. It's normal. SA is a proven partner & ally & worthy opponent!
 KSA  USA
8834 2018-10-15 12:27:17 Interesting. I seem to recall ringing the shooting option up before in conversation a few week ago and you were opposing it. Said EDM doesn’t have a shooter like TBL, WPG, WSH etc and that’s a key reason the PP wasn’t successful. You said it wasnt a factor. What changed?
8835 2018-10-15 12:27:13 my sister bought me a oil diffuser for my birthday and i think it’s my favorite thing right now... only positive vibes coming my way.
8836 2018-10-15 12:27:06 And we will be using them if oil doesn't come down
8837 2018-10-15 12:26:44 #Saudl Arabia! What an absolute joke our world is.
We want their oil so desperately trying to condemn them without upsetting them! 
This world of ours is so very moral at the start of every turn and then find every excuse for not being so at a particular moment.
2018 & sliding!
8838 2018-10-15 12:26:43 The Saudis sell us oil, and we sell them weapons. They export hate and extremism (Bin Laden), and wage war against their neighbors, we turn a blind eye
8839 2018-10-15 12:26:40 You seem to have inferred that I believe Indian imports of Iranian oil should fall to zero immediately in November. However, nothing I wrote implies that.

8843 2018-10-15 12:25:56 Your head to get oil
8844 2018-10-15 12:25:56 The stupid ass doesn’t know the meaning of science!

If Trump had the slightest inkling of it he’d get his snout out of the ass of BIG OIL & see what global warming is doing to the world!

But he’s  lousy Republican’t who wants his money NOW!
8845 2018-10-15 12:25:46 Think of the incentives,Head lopping,Canings,stonings,Christmas carols at the December games,Cheap booze,Sumptious pork sandwiches, Man of the match will be awarded a barrel of oil, and much more?
8846 2018-10-15 12:25:40 You’ll be beautiful scars an all girl. But if it bothers you try some bio oil or coconut oil
8847 2018-10-15 12:25:35 Um, no.Trump is Rev. Wright's penultimate "chickens coming home to roost" for targeted assassinations, puppet dictators, etc., not to mention treatment of our own vulnerable.He's what we prop up overseas for cheap oil & goods.We destroyed THEIR lives. They have a right to speak.
8848 2018-10-15 12:25:28 @KellyannePolls is an amazing snake oil salesman.  Spin, spin, spin.
8849 2018-10-15 12:25:26 If there's only one skincare tip that I could share, I highly recommend oil cleansing (double cleansing).

It's just so damn wonderful I cannot emphasize it more.

1st cleanse: oil based cleanser
2nd cleanse: low pH face wash

It. Does. Wonders!
8850 2018-10-15 12:25:23 I’d give Jesse a shot as a shooter on PP1 with that group of RNH, Draisaitl, McDavid, Klefbom.

8854 2018-10-15 12:25:08 Obama saved the economy. Save the auto industry. Got Bin Laden. Got a good deal with Iran (that they're abiding by), Trump scuttled for no reason. Had smart economic and energy policies. Reduced our dependence on foreign oil dramatically. Trump is in bed with Kremlin $, $audis.

Should read Audit Scotland reports or IFS as they are unbiased .. I research and read German: Spanish papers about EU. Do you?
8860 2018-10-15 12:24:22 How would you increase the speed of the actual compilers or hardware?
Sorry, if you put it like you do, it sounds like snake oil software as SoftRAM back in the day way.
Can you phrase it in a way that sounds more reputable and gives a hint about what the actual benefit is?

8867 2018-10-15 12:23:23 The Saudis are sending a message to the world, you can't count of their oil. If you don't support the Saudi funding of terrorism, or horrendous human rights violations, or murderous actions they will cut off the supply. Every nation should be investing in alternate energy.
8868 2018-10-15 12:23:11 Not that I had any, but I won't be doing business with #SaudiArabia! I need to cut down on my oil dependency asap!

The price of OPEC oil price is at 79.36 while the prices of other oil market competitors such as Brent and WTI are at 81 and 71 USD per barrel, respectively. Meaning, OPEC has a balance price.

8888 2018-10-15 12:20:49 it's about hegemony. Russia's only warm water port is in Syria. It's stopping a confederation of Arab countries reforming. there are multiple reasons oil is one of them.

8892 2018-10-15 12:20:43 True. In terms of emissions and our climate breakdown it doesn't  matter if the oil is extracted by the Socialist Republic of Alba or Exxon though, does it?

8897 2018-10-15 12:20:34 No limit to imagination. Oil demand by 2020 is expected to be down by 10-15%due to electric commercial vehicles and economic slow down in general. Plus, if oil really touches $200 (Forget $400) the demand will fall by further 20-30%.The price actually would range $80-$110
8898 2018-10-15 12:20:25 gets ko naman bat ang mamahal ng bilihin ngayon, alam ko rin na hindi lang train law ang isa sa mga pangunahing dahilan eh, andyan pa pagtaas ng presyo sa world market, crude oil, tapos lack of agricultural supplies *hays ompong* pero aAAAa wala lang. Sino ba talaga dapat iblame?
8899 2018-10-15 12:20:00 I’m always moisturized in some kind of body oil. For some reason, regular lotions just not making me as soft anymore. So I switched to the body oils months ago and 
8900 2018-10-15 12:19:58 So I discovered oil painting is fucking hard today.  Tried to jump in the deep end with it.  Hated it.  I need to do some studying before I attempt again.
8901 2018-10-15 12:19:57 No, the interest of Russians& all other Europeans are mass migrations from Middle East after Yankees bust yet another state & throw it into chaos so that they can tap into cheap oil! The interest of Europeans r Yankee troops at Russian doors& war on EU.soil! A super distraction.

8916 2018-10-15 12:18:36 SA said on Sunday it would retaliate against any punitive measures (possible sanctions etc) with 'even stronger' ones and made reference to its role in the global economy - as the world's largest oil exporter. In practice it makes no sense for it to take any action to cut supply.

8949 2018-10-15 12:15:47 The “petro dollar” is now backed by US oil and natural gas (the largest energy producer in the world) and by forty—five years of reserve holding and use as a currency
8950 2018-10-15 12:15:47 Why are you spending so much on olive oil? Damn
8951 2018-10-15 12:15:46 mark farts often because he works day and night hit by the cold wind every day. anyone give him hot patch or cajuput oil please
8952 2018-10-15 12:15:44 Dear @MrsGandhi,  An unsettling fact for you -  Between 2012-2014 UPA Govt evolved a  unique system to buy oil from Iran, when it was under sanction & as  we couldn't trade in USD - We paid faction of amount in INR &  bartered other half in Rice/Wheat/Vegetable Oil etc.

8954 2018-10-15 12:15:17 There was an unprecedented OIL BOOM from 2009-2014, earned a HUGE windfall from that mono product. MOST OF IT WAS STOLEN. Nothing available to build infrastructure or build & equip our hospitals & schools. No savings for a rainy day. Oil crashed, Economy crashed. That’s why!

8956 2018-10-15 12:14:54 Lisette36396 This looks like the central part of a very large Sunflower! I guess if you squished it, you might get Sunflower Oil?!
8957 2018-10-15 12:14:51 Yeah with the actifry I have I'll add more oil so they stick to it. God, this thread is making me hangry.
8958 2018-10-15 12:14:44 No need to join Euro -Sweden hasn’t & won’t. Vast majority of U.K. fish are landed in Scotland. I agree oil is best left in ground for the sake of climate but even then our resources of renewable energy are huge. Permanent moratorium on fracking here due to public health risk

8963 2018-10-15 12:14:16 Really?  Hillary Clinton and the truth are like oil and water.  Her lack of ability to say the honest truth about some things is the reason she lost the 2016 presidential election.  She wrote a book about it that fails to mention that difficult truth.
8964 2018-10-15 12:14:08 Lol The US produces more oil than Saudi Arabia and also exports massive amounts of natural gas- countries need dollars to buy oil and gas from the US- the “petro dollar” is backed now by US oil

8989 2018-10-15 12:12:27 @Dora_Siliya I miss you... Where are you. Have heard  this price of oil is up, and there's speculation it could reach $100 in part due to political fallout from the Jamal Khashoggi saga. Donald Trump vowed to take action against Saudi Arabia,  kingdom promised to hit back.
8990 2018-10-15 12:12:27 ...of course he did...he’s a feckless di*kwad, a coward and a phony kkkristian too, dressed up like he snake oil salesman he’s ALWAYS been.
8991 2018-10-15 12:12:23 @TheDailyTurbo Hoi Nico, kun je de route paaltjes voor Brent Oil eens geven
8992 2018-10-15 12:12:09 Over the medium-term it would lead to massive #oil demand destruction and an accelerated race into #renewableenergy and electric cars. The 1973-74 embargo, and the second oil crisis in 1979, destroyed oil demand for ever as industrialized countries taxed #gasoline and #diesel
8993 2018-10-15 12:12:08 But if the #Saudis retaliate using oil, it would lead to “calamity, “This would be so destabilizing for global market
8994 2018-10-15 12:12:07 True, #Riyadh can bring the global economy to its knees in the short-term by cutting output and sending prices sharply up. The kingdom pumps one-in-ten #oil barrels produced worldwide, and holds nearly all the spare capacity available to respond to any supply outage
8995 2018-10-15 12:12:01 Cooking a late breakfast, no oil in the house, fresh scrambled eggs, grits, Turkey bacon. No bread this am.
8996 2018-10-15 12:11:50 Was't such a deal made with Iraq under "oil for food" program during INC/UPA rule Mr Natwar Sing had to go in the black book then ?
8997 2018-10-15 12:11:49 No o. It helps. But what kind of moisturizer? Does it contain oil?

9002 2018-10-15 12:11:25 They have more power over us than ever since we ended cordial relations with Iran and tore up that deal. Now Saudi Arabia is our main oil provider. Plus not to mention it’s less what Saudi will do to America but to trump cause he’s got so much invested there. He’s compromised.

9014 2018-10-15 12:10:15 Personally I think it was a combination of the two. Nigeria got into a bad place economically not only because our leaders stole but because there was no foresight or spatial awareness to diagnose our Key product risk: the overdependence on income from oil.

9023 2018-10-15 12:08:52 While the mere hint of #Saudi Arabia using #oil as an economic weapon still brings back memories of queues at the pump and stagflation in the Western world, there are good reasons why #Saudi Arabia hasn’t wanted to brandish oil-market power as a political tool.

9040 2018-10-15 12:07:22 The conference, dubbed Davos in the Desert, will be hosted by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who has been spearheading the country’s efforts to reduce its reliance on oil. The conference begins next Monday.
9041 2018-10-15 12:07:07 For 45 years, it’s been considered out of bounds for #SaudiArabia. But all of a sudden, Riyadh made what many read as a veiled threat to use the kingdom’s oil wealth as a political weapon -- something unheard of since the 1973 Arab embargo that triggered the first oil crisis
9042 2018-10-15 12:07:03 Who threw oil workers under the  bus ? No one down east gives a crap about the west that’s for sure.

9049 2018-10-15 12:06:23 I despise Jason Kenney. But it won’t be just one more pipeline. When this one fails to meet expectations (as it will), they’ll want another. And another. And another. It’s just an updated version of “god, send us one more oil boom and we promise not to waste it this time.”
9050 2018-10-15 12:06:14 All eyes have been on the new sanctions on Iran but time to watch how the situation unfolds over missing journalist Khashoggi. SA under intense pressure. This could change the dynamics of oil flow from SA is US puts sanctions on SA. Follow closesly
9051 2018-10-15 12:06:05 Yes to all of this. But GloMag, the likely vehicle, doesn’t target an economy necessarily. Outcome would almost certainly be like Turkey, where market overreacted to individual designations. Still an effect but I’d be stunned if oil was even in the sanx discussions
9052 2018-10-15 12:05:48 Yum, portobellos are delicious, but I think they’re better with olive oil & balsamic. Chimichurri can be overpowering.
9053 2018-10-15 12:05:47 Because the owners of all the oil own everything, including Europe, and now they are coming for America.

9060 2018-10-15 12:05:04 It's not compatible to meet our Paris Agreement commitments and continue to extract fossil fuels. Net Zero is the new target and a Just Transition away from oil dependency is a necessity

9117 2018-10-15 11:58:00 The oil producers of the Middle East are standing in solidarity and Trump too, of course. That’s what the murder was all about. Trump wants to control the oil and the journalist was exposing them.

9121 2018-10-15 11:57:28 just my morning thoughts as I oil myself up with all these demonic decorations around me lol.
9122 2018-10-15 11:57:28 that would be a  "make my day" moment for Trump. if that happens, the production coming out of USMCA in 12 months would be huge and oil would be on its way back to $25. Saudi would be committing economic suicide by doing that.

9126 2018-10-15 11:57:20 I’m just hoping this olive oil doesn’t cost me more than $40. Because that’s like all the money I have at the moment. I know it cost $11. But it’ll probably cost $40 by the time I get to the counter for some reason.
9127 2018-10-15 11:57:10 While there is no doubt that a #Saudi #oil-shock will have consequences for the global economy, it is also clear that the Saudi economy will be hit hard.

Using oil as a political weapon might lead to an #Arab winter of discontent, which isn't in the interest of the Saudi rulers.

The 1% are using the 99% sons & daughters as mercenaries! #Turkey #SaudiArabia #Iran #Iraq #Blackmen #Egypt #Yemen #Blackwomen #SouthAfrica #Nigeria #Africa
9218 2018-10-15 11:46:42 Oil is choking our throats; Oil is submerging the tower of the rule of law; Oil is erasing life without a trace. I cannot drink Oil, of course; but can I swim in Oil? Help, I am not seeing the bottom!
9219 2018-10-15 11:46:41 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?

9229 2018-10-15 11:45:59 Channelstv to festus Keyamo: explain the fuel subsidy today 

Festus Keyamo: Delta occurred when crude oil rose beyond $43. So the delta started not subsidy.... bla bla 

The delta theory of Buhari's fuel subsidy scam according Festus Keyamo

Propaganda can never whitewash fraud
9230 2018-10-15 11:45:50 Indian PM modi requests Oil companies to review payment terms to give temporary relief to local currency Rupee 

- sudden stop for Saudi Oil purchase: why buy oil now at high when you can buy at $60 in one month
9231 2018-10-15 11:45:11 An island is the illustration of how stupid it is to keep producing gas guzzling cars. In the big picture - u can only fit so many cars on a planet. You can only make so big of a carbon footprint b4 the earth is no longer processing the carbon dioxide. We shouldn't need Saudi oil
9232 2018-10-15 11:44:43 Saudi production of oil is 10 m barrels a day X 80 X 365.

That is just for one year.
9233 2018-10-15 11:44:42 The government needs to step in and step up against the war in Yemen.  Stop feeding the Saudis weapons and aid in return for oil. They are assisting in a war that could leave 12 million people at risk of starvation.
9234 2018-10-15 11:44:40 @NutellaGlobal Hi I have just discovered that you use Palm Oil in your products.

9240 2018-10-15 11:44:09 If other business leaders follow Damon’s example ,MBS’ attempt to move Saudi Arabia away from an oil dependent economy wil fail.

You cannot proclaim yourself a reformer while crushing dissent.
9241 2018-10-15 11:44:02 This woman Elise is a stupid head, she blames Trump for being soft or in bed with the Saudi’s, oil can go up past $100 a barrel, if that happened she would turn around and blame that on Trump as well, criteria to be on #morningjoe,? Stupidity and Dishonesty
9242 2018-10-15 11:43:57 It is even doubtful if #EU will let you in. Think you would be better off sticking with the #UK. Have you worked out how much your share of the National Debt that @TonyBlairEurope run up, you would have to take with you. And consider - when oil runs out!
9243 2018-10-15 11:43:49 Just as Sweden tired of Norway, England tires of Scotland....only problem is we still have a good 50 years of oil reserves....
9244 2018-10-15 11:43:41 And where is Venezuela right now do also check that they couldn’t even balance the budget when the oil price was close to 150 it’s all gimmicks that have destroyed the Venezuelan economy and overburdened it with massive debt not a good example to follow

9248 2018-10-15 11:43:06 #UKOG It was not until 1959 that a borehole at Kimmeridge showed that oil was seeping out, and 1960 that British Petroleum'sKimmeridge Oil Field was discovered. In the 60s they new that Kimm is a bull eye, BP sold entire concept to Perenco we just need to wait, oil is there.

9251 2018-10-15 11:42:42 @cspanwj It's amazing Saudi Arabia is going to hold up our oil that we ship over there which only became legal a few years back, because the Republicans greedy bastard wanted to ship it overseas and make more money
9252 2018-10-15 11:42:37 SB 250 is a bill introduced to protect oil and gas pipelines, wells and other infrastructure from public protests. Louisiana passed a similar bill that resulted in protestors and journalists being charged with felonies even though they were not on private property.

My helper: I don't need many. I need its oil. I rub it on my sore back.

9263 2018-10-15 11:41:18 Dear @BBCEngland Of course boss of Fracking firm will say we need oil from fracking. Why don't you mention air quality report that Government held back for about three years which said fracking would have a negative impact on quality. Only released after go ahead given.
9264 2018-10-15 11:41:17 basically the question should be: Would the US support a country with that much oil if it was truly democratic and especially if the US feared it would make decisions to be independent of the US?
9265 2018-10-15 11:41:08 Saudi Arabia has oil?! Who knew?
9266 2018-10-15 11:41:04 you do realise GERS allocates all “Scotland’s Oil” generates taxes to Scotland?

Or are you arguing the North Sea should be taxed more heavily than it is now?

9275 2018-10-15 11:40:16 So because this is happening to Egypt then it should happen to Nigeria? Now I understand what they say about buharist

9276 2018-10-15 11:40:16 Unless they are threatening nuclear tests or they have oil or they are “promising” to buy weapons from us or they want to help Trump get elected, should Americans care?

They gave up when #Trump was elected, which is one reason why the price of gas has gone up some 40% since he took office.

9311 2018-10-15 11:35:35 Stk mkts(-) amid concerns that we could observe a sharp increase in crude oil prices due to the escalation of geopolitical tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia, due to the dissappareance of reporter Khashoggi
9312 2018-10-15 11:35:23 This isn’t a level playing field. But it was never going to be with the size and power of the oil and gas lobbies.
9313 2018-10-15 11:35:04 Why should any Nigerian at all vote PDP? they ruled for 16years, sold crude oil at record highs but left poverty and looting as the benchmark of their achievements.

9352 2018-10-15 11:30:06 Good for you. I am taking the motor home into the shop for an oil change then go look at some car that will be available at tomorrow’s auction. Have a great day!
9353 2018-10-15 11:30:05 oil leaks and harmful boat cleaning agents are bad for our water. boat sustainably!
9354 2018-10-15 11:30:03 Big whoop, you import more oil from Canada, almost 3 times more. The Saudi don't hold anything over the U.S. except the money the they have loaned out to your 1%ers.
9355 2018-10-15 11:30:02 @LBC Fracking gas will be exactly the same as the North Sea Oil, it will go straight into the market.

9357 2018-10-15 11:29:36 Don't lie. That type of behavior is the one which will not see Zimbabwe prospering. A spade has to be called a spade. Enter in most supermarkets and basic items like sugar, cooking oil and etc are nowhere to be found.
9358 2018-10-15 11:29:16 What an irony! When the treasury was looted blind & oil prices slumped how can you grow the economy,how can you provide basic infrastructures ,how can you reduce poverty? We need 2 fight corruption 2 a stand still.These rogues av 2 stay here& face the consequences of their greed.
9359 2018-10-15 11:29:07 So looking at oil prices for winter and pissed. $2.70 is lowest. Haven't seen this since Bush. Feels like #mapa make Americans poor again
9360 2018-10-15 11:28:44 Hi Jenna, thanks for getting in touch and for providing some photographs. Firstly, we’re really sorry to see this. It looks like edible oil which isnt harmful but shouldn’t be on your bread. Can you DM your name, address and the codes from the resealable tag and we’ll sort this.
9361 2018-10-15 11:28:41 @theJeremyVine If people have a vested interest in the fracking industry they will use spin to create an idea that science is wrong. Climate science is not wrong! Neither are the hundreds of studies that show there are risks to us with onshore drilling for oil and gas!!

9367 2018-10-15 11:27:52 @bbcradio2 @thejeremyvine   Shale rock is impermiable, often called a seal rock because it seals oil and gas in useful reservoirs below. Damage seals at your peril.!!

9381 2018-10-15 11:25:00 @mtaibbi Could you please explain to me how none of the coverage on Khashoggi has mentioned the petro dollar or the price of oil? Part of the reason imo of distrust of media has to do with lies by omission. I really feel that the Khashoggi coverage has a lot of that.
9382 2018-10-15 11:24:43 Bread & milk isn’t everywhere the same. Petrol and oil isn’t either, nor is the USD. Supply and demand in different places, just the way it is.
9383 2018-10-15 11:24:39 Average Saudi oil production in 2018 was 10.2M bpd it has slightly trailed U.S. output at 10.6M bpd,but Saudi exports have averaged 7M bpd outpacing U.S. 1.8M bpd of exports.
9384 2018-10-15 11:24:37 The interests of paranoid Israel, which wants un-tamed Syria defeated, and of Sunni Saudi Arabia (SA), which wants non-Sunni Arab states like Syria turned Sunni coincide in Syria's rape. The West assists it by supporting Sunni terrorists as its oil/arms economy depends on SA.
9385 2018-10-15 11:24:23 Really pisses me off when people say “oh you look really well, you’re glowing”  well no because on the inside and outside I’m dying and the glow is rose hip oil but thanks 
9386 2018-10-15 11:23:38 Like it or not, it's a capitalist world. Reducing dependence on oil is one strand, but increasing domestic production is another. Because drilling the earth will happen either way, we'll just be importing it.

9392 2018-10-15 11:23:09 Good news on the trade deficit. It’s narrowed down to a 5 month low which could mean that GoI’s measures to combat widening CAD might be paying dividends. This despite an inflated oil import bill...hope trend continues.
9393 2018-10-15 11:23:01 To live in fear of genocide is rather unnecessary things are tough here but there are alot worse places to be on this earth. Thank heavens we don't have oil otherwise we would also be a warzone.

9401 2018-10-15 11:21:53 How about a fetish for the texture of lonely oil spills under cars, heehee!!
9402 2018-10-15 11:21:53 That's pretty much impossible. Plastics are critical components in the manufacture of many things, from ships to medical equipment and indeed to solar panels. Yes we should be reducing our reliance on oil but the reality is that to remove it totally is 100 years or more away

9404 2018-10-15 11:21:19 With #oil up 10% over the past month, and geopolitical issues, the price of energy could quickly develop into a headwind for the economy.
9405 2018-10-15 11:21:15 Coconut oil! Lol!!! Kills me how they think it’s like a magic cream or something
9406 2018-10-15 11:21:05 It’s simple math of 2+2
Oil price increased in intel market from 60$brl to 90$brl (30%)in last 9mnths
Rupee against $ devalued frm104 to 132 in 9months(abt25%)
So total impact on energy cost abt55%

9410 2018-10-15 11:20:33 We can do the math, bucko. 67 cents a barrel won’t destroy the oil sector.

I would love to see the time machine that the person who offered the drugs used to bring them back from the future.

Because they do not exist today, you credulous buffoon. 
And you met people who were sold snake oil.

9518 2018-10-15 11:07:10 It’s unfair to write off palm oil completely. Just bcus a few supplier r breaking the law, American & European companies are using it as an excuse to give palm oil a bad name.

9523 2018-10-15 11:06:36 There are more critical reasons to get off oil, but the decline of the Saudi royal family will be a nice bonus.

9527 2018-10-15 11:06:09 To reduce oil imports we have to save fuel. One way of saving it is by declaring mandatory holiday to all offices, factories and educational institutions on all Saturdays. Currently only very few sectors are given holiday on Saturday.

How do they all make a living?
From hate.
Hate is big business right now.
It's never about who to and not to hate.
It's how much floods into their own coffers.
They have tapped into Brexit and religious phobia like they have struck oil.

9578 2018-10-15 10:59:24 can u imagine the carbon footprint of each bottle of water we buy? from the making of the bottle to the transportation all are oil consuming and the eventual discarding of bottle to create another set of pollution. so many individual lifestyle changing examples for other things

9587 2018-10-15 10:57:51 Hija, it is simply greed. Oil companies are selling old inventory as if they are just newly imported at recent prices. Electricity prices are being manipulated. Rice traders continue to smuggle and hoard. Mall owners inflate their prices taking advantage of Xmas spending penchant
9588 2018-10-15 10:57:49 KSA knows it won’t win an oil war this time; US deficit in oil since 2005 is already down by half. It’ll disappear if prices spike. Then what?
9589 2018-10-15 10:57:45 Even Hawiyes have criticisms of the current administration and admit the shadyness of Soma Oil and Gas. You accept this deal which gives this company 90% of our oil revenue?
9590 2018-10-15 10:57:29 Thing is, if crude price goes down, our economy suffers, if it goes up, we must subsidize one way or another, I dont expect buhari that left the oil & gas stage 20yrs ago to know that, but im glad he embraced reality, same way  trump realized NATO is the Bulwark of global sec.

9604 2018-10-15 10:55:32 @lbc #lbc India just committed to use gas, because it is a bit greener than oil & cheaper mainly due to US fracking. The 1.3 billion people produce under 2 ton/yr/person CO2 (EU 8, US 15). They will want to use more power, just to stand still need massive change.

9619 2018-10-15 10:53:38 Shut the fuck up trying to label me qabilist. I pointed to the biggest sign of corruption in the Farmaao administration being Soma Oil and Gas and you label me a qabilist. Also stop Larping as a Isaaq, even unionist Isaaqs have heavy criticisms of the South, something you lack.
9620 2018-10-15 10:53:22 Exactly. It’s not 1978. Only 10% of oil from there is refined here at Saudi Aramco. If we didn’t have a jackass in the White House, we would replace that with Canadian imports.
9621 2018-10-15 10:53:21 Halfway into saying “hot sauce” I changed my mind and said “chilli oil” instead so I ended up asking kuya from SaladStop for “hot oil”

9647 2018-10-15 10:50:26 Okay hear me out on this. You’re over here bitching about climate change, the pipeline, and how no ones doing anything about it but, you heat your house with oil, you drive a gas powered car, you have tires on that car, and you cook on a gas stove.

9655 2018-10-15 10:49:40 Exactly!!!   Americans must not forget because we know Saudi murdered our journalist.  But is this exactly what Putin wanted?   Did Saudi do this to prod America to get mad in order to raise oil prices to help Saudi and Putin make more money.
9656 2018-10-15 10:49:36 I'd rather see the oil companies invest in scientific progress. It's unfortunate the old guard is dug in. Fortunately, your son is right on time. It's tough to witness a media gaslight

9753 2018-10-15 10:38:01 DW: In the near term, economic environment will continue to be extremely challenging. Global economic outlook is dimming with the escalating trade war, and growing debt. Add to it, oil prices are increasing. So, pressure on currency likely to continue. #IPSSOE2018 #SriLanka
9754 2018-10-15 10:37:59 I would like to ask @MrsGandhi Aapaa if farmers will be allowed to barter crops at petrol pumps dispensing Iranian oil. Poor farmers not getting even the MSP rates.

9764 2018-10-15 10:37:10 You guys overlook how the Saudis tried to destroy US oil self sufficiency by dropping the price well below the cost of production for fracking and oil sands.
9765 2018-10-15 10:36:55 Just normal stuff most other countries have, then?  Doesn’t construct thin need a market?  Isn’t oil production price dependent? You don’t half talk some bollocks.

9772 2018-10-15 10:35:07 Because you're talking about thousands of drivers across every US region who independently choose when & where to refuel. TNCs would have to negotiate "hidden" pump prices based on oil market/futures prices, & seamlessly integrate a gas card every major supplier's payment system.
9773 2018-10-15 10:35:04 me a week ago: If Saudi Arabia really killed Jamal Khashoggi as a tool of repression against good, honest journalism, they should face immediate, hefty sanctions.

9794 2018-10-15 10:31:55 @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia are main US partner on Middle East because that she are main oil producer. If US will control oil market then all countries will be supposed to America, comprehensive Saudi Arabia, Russia and China.
9795 2018-10-15 10:31:29 Both have point systems. It’s worth looking to see if there are specific job sectors that might help you enter. A friend got PR and fast track immigration because she had experience in oil industry accounting. AUS is often looking for teachers and engineers.

With just one glance you tear my skirt
And I say...
NO
9802 2018-10-15 10:31:04 The real tragedy is that Nigeria can't give him a better life despite being richer in oil and minerals. Nigerian leaders need start acting like self-determined adults and not stepchildren to Western imperialists.

Someone might want to tell the king Solomon the oil is drying up once the oil is gone the country will go to hell! Allah cannot save you now you started something you surely cannot finish!

9820 2018-10-15 10:28:35 You think Soma Oil and Gas paying a retainer fee to the Minister they were negotiating with is not corruption? The prosecutors admitted to finding corruption but nothing that would hold up in the highest courts which requires an impeccable paper trail. The company is corrupt

9838 2018-10-15 10:25:36 PM highlighted that consuming countries, due to rising crude oil prices, face many other economic challenges including serious resource crunch.  Cooperation of oil producing countries would be very critical to bridge this gap.
9839 2018-10-15 10:25:32 So I used the CBD oil yesterday for the first time, didn’t expect anything as I’ve been told it could take weeks to build up in the body before you see any affects. However, I took a little more in the evening within correct dosage I did take it with my usual migraine meds..

9841 2018-10-15 10:25:28 Prime Minister noted that the oil market is producer driven; and both the quantity and prices are determined by the oil producing countries. Though there is enough production, the unique features of marketing in the oil sector have pushed up the oil prices.

9848 2018-10-15 10:24:36 I disagree but that’s maybe because most of time lived in worked in Aberdeen, large university city plus oil has made it home for large numbers of European citizens especially Dutch and French. In France currently but was in London for couple of days. Feel more at home in France.
9849 2018-10-15 10:24:35 @jimcramer Just heard that futures are down, and oil is up because of worries over Saudi Arabia. As if this will escalate to the point where supply is impacted. Did Wall St. traders skip class when they taught the concept "Money talks and bulls**t walks."
9850 2018-10-15 10:24:25 Dentists, smh, no better than snake oil salesmen tbh
9851 2018-10-15 10:23:59 I agree about global warming but stopping Canada from producing doesn’t stop the rest of the world, it just limits our jobs and makes more oil transported by trucks and trains. Let’s talk about how to reduce over population on this planet
9852 2018-10-15 10:23:55 how much cheaper oil People of India got?
9853 2018-10-15 10:23:47 Yep and it leads straight to Trump and big oil convincing the feeble-minded to believe their nonsense

9872 2018-10-15 10:20:03 Not sure that's what people are 'cheering' in the main they are pointing to the hypocrisy of the claim that there is no oil left. I hope we tax them to the max and redistribute the revenues on a better Scotland.

9943 2018-10-15 10:09:15 We don’t need MORE gas and oil - a whole new gas and oil extraction industry. That investment of money and political capital would be better spent on making what we have more efficient and more renewable-friendly so that we reduce rather than increase our fossil fuel dependency.

9953 2018-10-15 10:07:19 What Buhari administration intend to do to change the current narrative is first, notify individual oil block owners that their licenses will be revoked after a period of time due to policy direction of the government and then, share them among the federating units accordingly.

9955 2018-10-15 10:07:11 It doesn't reveal anything we didn't already know; merely reinforcing the existing consensus.

The West pretends to fall for Saudi lies to get cheap oil. Once that runs out, they are no longer useful and will be dropped like an empty candy wrapper.
9956 2018-10-15 10:07:10 We have been so concern to see this country. Oil prize is raising on almost of every years. The rupiah exchange value is decline so badly. And people with no jobs and bad future is everywhere.
